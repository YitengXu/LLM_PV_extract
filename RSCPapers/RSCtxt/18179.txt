    , Accepted 8th February 2016First published on 10th February 2016AbstractQuantum dot sensitized solar cells with high theoretical conversion efficiency, low production cost and a simple production process have received great attention in recent years. For CdSe-sensitized cells, the most significant defect of CdSe is that it has the weak absorption between 550 and 600 nm and no absorption after 650 nm, so it is crucial to find a wide spectrum photosensitizer to make up for the defect. Here, wide spectrum and pure inorganic Donor–Acceptor (D–A) Type Polyoxometalate (POM) K6H4[α-SiW9O37Co3(H2O)3]·17H2O (denoted as T) is firstly introduced into QDSCs as a collaborative cosensitizer with CdSe. The T has a visible characteristic peak centering between 550 and 600 nm, and also has stronger absorption after 650 nm, which could make up for the defect of CdSe to constitute a wide spectrum of absorption. The fluorescence spectrum, surface photovoltage spectrum, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum and solid diffuse spectrum were used to explore the photosensitivity of T. In addition, the D–A type POM can act as a good intermediate for the injection of electrons and improve the visible photocurrent response; meanwhile, it can obviously reduce the dark current and increase the electron lifetime, which can solve the problem about the high recombination at the QD/TiO2/electrolyte interface. In general, the best photovoltaic performance of T and CdSe cosensitized solar cells is increased to 6.59% (Jsc = 18.37 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.57 V, FF = 0.63), which is improved by 32.33% compared to those of the pure CdSe-sensitized cells (Jsc = 16.20 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.50 V, FF = 0.61, η = 4.98%).
Introduction
Adequately developing solar energy has become the best choice to solve the energy crisis, because it is clean, accessible and continuable relative to other non-renewable resources.1 For the past few years, photovoltaic cells have experienced rapid development. Since Grätzel and coworkers firstly reported dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) in 1991, the highest efficiency has been up to more than 12%.2 Quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs)3 and perovskite solar cells4 have also aroused wide concerns and made good achievements in recent years. Semi-conductor quantum dots, containing finite numbers of atoms, are quasi-zero-dimensional nano-materials, which have broad application prospects in solar cells, light emitting devices, optical biomarkers, and other fields, ascribed to their quantum size effect, the band gap tunability, high absorption coefficient, solution processability, and multiple exciton generation possibilities.5 But their low coverage on TiO2 films, lack of panchromatic QD sensitizers, high recombination at the QD/TiO2/electrolyte interface, and the efficiency of electron injection hinder the improvements of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of QDSCs. In recent years, Zhong et al. have come up with many new strategies to improve efficiency, and the record efficiency of QDSCs has approached 9%.6 For CdSe-sensitized cells, the most significant defect of CdSe is that it has weak absorption between 550 and 600 nm and no absorption after 650 nm, so it is crucial to find a wide spectrum photosensitizer to make up for the defect.3
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a class of d-block transitional metal oxygen clusters with remarkable structural diversity and a variety of chemical compositions, which have been widely applied in optoelectronic materials and devices.7 Some transition metal-substituted POMs may absorb visible light, which can make up for the shortcomings of traditional POMs only absorbing ultraviolet.8 Recently, transition metal-substituted POMs have been applied in the photoanodes and electrolytes of DSSCs.9 One of the most important research parts of DSSCs is the employment of pure inorganic POM-based sensitizers, which should have specific conditions: (1) the POMs should have suitable energy levels to ensure electrons to be injected into the conduction band of titanium dioxide; (2) the POMs should not only absorb ultraviolet light, but also absorb visible light or infrared. In our previous work, we firstly explored the Keggin-type polyoxometalate PW11RhCOOH as the photosensitizer for assembling the POM sensitized solar cells, and the results show that PW11RhCOOH displayed relatively better photovoltaic response due to energy level matching and higher carrier separation efficiency.10 In addition, we purposefully investigate the energy band structures of 13 kinds of POMs according to the solid diffuse reflection method and cyclic voltammetry, and their relationship was detailed, summarized and discussed.11 Among them, T not only has a suitable level, but also has a relatively wide range of spectral absorption, which can make up for the defect of the visible spectral range for CdSe, so as to constitute a wide spectrum of absorption. Furthermore, the molecular orbital of T was preliminarily studied by computational modeling, which proved that T can be regarded as a kind of donor–acceptor (D–A) type POM. Experimental results confirmed that it showed superior performance in the DSSCs.11 So we introduce T into the QDSCs for the first time as a collaborative cosensitizer for a wide spectrum of absorption.
In recent years, collaborative cosensitization has been widely used to improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. From the reported literature studies, a certain amount of cosensitizer added to the photovoltaic devices can improve the photoresponse and charge carrier transfer, which is mainly due to the increased absorbance and the reduced recombination.12
Herein, T was uniformly assembled on TiO2 by a simple sol–gel method13 and introduced into the QDSCs as a collaborative cosensitizer to further improve the efficiency of CdSe-sensitized QDSCs, which exhibited considerably excellent photovoltaic performance by collaborative sensitization. The mechanism of collaborative sensitization was explained. The charge transfer process of T was proved by Surface Photovoltage Spectroscopy (SPV) and fluorescence emission spectroscopy. It is important that the T introduced into the QDSCs can reduce carrier recombination and increase the lifetime of excited electrons. Notably, different amounts of T introduced into photoanodes have shown high conversion efficiencies of 6.17%, 6.47%, 6.59% and 6.06%, respectively, which are superior to that of pure CdSe-sensitized cells (4.89%).
Experimental details
Materials
K6H4[α-SiW9O37Co3(H2O)3]·17H2O was synthesized according to the reported method.14 Zinc acetate (Zn(OAc)2, 99.99%), sulfur powder (99.99%), selenium powder (99.999%), oleylamine (OAm, 90%), 1-octadecene (>90%), and oleic acid (85%) were purchased from Aladdin. 3-Mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, 97%) was received from J&K Chemical (Beijing, China). All other reagents were received from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Beijing, China) and all were used without further purification.
Synthesis of T@TiO2
A certain amount of T was dissolved in 5 mL of deionized water forming solution A, and 5 mL titanium isopropoxide was added dropwise into 3 mL n-butyl alcohol forming solution B. Then the solution A was added to solution B at the speed of a second every drop. The generated sol was sealed for 3 hours at 45 °C, and then sealed for 3 hours at 80 °C in a vacuum oven. Finally, the obtained mixture was dried at 60 °C for 12 hours, and 80 °C for 3 hours in a vacuum oven. The amount of T was 0.00 g, 0.05 g, 0.10 g, 0.20 g and 0.30 g, respectively, corresponding to T0@TiO2, T1@TiO2, T2@TiO2, T3@TiO2, and T4@TiO2.
Quantum dot sensitized solar cell fabrication
We have prepared water-soluble 3-mercaptopropionic acid-capped CdSe (MPA-CdSe) quantum dots according to the reported method by Zhong et al.15 The reference cells with TiO2 photoanodes sensitized by pure CdSe were denoted as QDSCs. The pure TiO2 paste was prepared as follows: 7.6 mL of anhydrous ethanol was added to a 50 mL beaker containing 1.0 g P25 powder under ultrasonication consecutively. After sonication for 30 min, 4.05 g of terpineol and 5.20 g of an ethanol solution with 10 wt% ethyl cellulose were added to the mixture and sonicated for another 30 min. Finally, the paste was obtained by removing ethanol through the rotary evaporation method.16 The T@TiO2 paste was prepared by a similar method, but the only difference is that the beaker contained a mixture of 0.05 g T@TiO2 and 0.95 g P25 powder.
We prepared the photoanode film by screen-printing the TiO2 paste on the FTO glass. Before screen-printing, the FTO glass had been cleaned and pretreated with 40 mmol L−1 TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min. Five layers of paste were deposited on the FTO glass and each layer was treated at 120 °C for 5 min. Then the photoanode was sintered at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, and 400 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the photoanodes were treated with 40 mmol L−1 TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min again and sintered at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, and 400 °C for 30 min again. The prepared photoanode films were immersed into the MPA-CdSe aqueous solution for 6 hours. Subsequently, the films were rinsed with deionized water and dried with N2. Then the photoanode films were coated with ZnS by dipping twice alternately into 0.1 M Zn(OAc)2 and 0.1 M Na2S solution for 1 min per dip.
The preparation method of the polysulfide electrolyte is as follows: 0.447 g KCl, 1.928 g S, and 14.414 g Na2S·9H2O were added into the mixed solution containing 9 mL methanol and 21 mL deionized water. Then the solution was stirred in the dark overnight and filtered while being used.
Characterization
The UV-vis spectra test was carried out in the range of 200–800 nm−1. TG curves were obtained on a PerkinElmer TGA7 instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 30 °C to 600 °C. The elemental mass ratio of W/Ti was determined by using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). X-ray powder diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku D/max-2550 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Fluorescence spectra were obtained with a FLSP920 Fluorescence Spectrometer. Surface photovoltage spectroscopy measurements are carried out on a lab-made instrument, which constitutes a source of monochromatic light, a lock-in amplifier (SR830-DSP) with a light chopper (SR540) and a photovoltaic cell. Monochromatic light was from a 500 W xenon lamp (CHFXQ500 W, Global xenon lamp power) and a double-prism monochromator (Hilger and Watts, D300). A high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) (JEOL-2100F) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV and a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; XL30, FEG, FEI Company) at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV were used to characterize the samples. All photoelectrochemical experiments were performed on a CHI601D electrochemical workstation at room temperature equipped with a xenon lamp as the light source and an AM 1.5 solar filter.
Results and discussion
The characterization of prepared T and CdSe
UV-vis absorption spectra of T and CdSe aqueous solution are shown in Fig. 1a to characterize the spectral range. From Fig. 1a, CdSe has a visible characteristic peak at 525 and 618 nm, and it has weak absorption between 550 and 600 nm and no absorption after 650 nm. Compared with CdSe, T displayed a visible characteristic peak centering between 550 and 600 nm, and also has stronger absorption after 650 nm. So T has wide absorption in the range of visible light, which can make up for the defect of the visible spectral range for CdSe. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra of the prepared T solid powder are shown in Fig. 1b, from which we can draw the conclusion that T has a strong absorption in the range of visible light, and the result is consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectrum of T in Fig. 1a.

The characterization of T@TiO2 composites
XRD was carried out to detect the changes of the TiO2 phase structure when T was loaded on the surface of TiO2. It can be seen from Fig. 2a that the location of the characteristic peaks of composites is consistent with that of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS card No. 21-1272), which indicates that the crystal shape of TiO2 is not changed in the T@TiO2 composites. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra of T0@TiO2, T1@TiO2, T2@TiO2, T3@TiO2, T4@TiO2 and pure TiO2 are presented in Fig. 2b. We can see from Fig. 2b that with the increase of the amount of T, the absorbance of visible light of composites increased gradually, and T0@TiO2 and pure TiO2 have no absorbance in visible and infrared regions, indicating that the addition of T can increase the visible light absorption of photoanodes. The EDS analysis (Fig. S3†) shows the existence of W and Co elements in the composite. Elemental mapping (Fig. S4†) reveals that the elements including Si, Ti, Co and W are distributed homogeneously, indicating the uniform dispersion of T on TiO2. The oxidation states of W, Co, and Ti of T3@TiO2 were studied by XPS (Fig. 2c, d and S5†). The energy regions of W4f in T3@TiO2 located at 35.0 eV and 37.1 eV are consistent with the WVI oxidation state.17 The binding energies of Co2p of T3@TiO2 show two peaks at ca. 781.2 eV in the energy region of Co2p3/2 and 797.2 eV in the energy region of Co2p1/2, which are consistent with the oxidation state of CoII.18 The elemental mass ratio of W/Ti in composites was determined by ICP-AES measurements (Fig. S6†), which indicate that their mass ratios are 3.78%, 7.49%, 14.17%, and 21.10%, respectively. It also proved that the content of T assembled on TiO2 was increased.

It can be seen from the TEM images of the T3@TiO2 composite in Fig. 3a that the interior structure of the composite is packed with nanocrystals and the surface of the composite has some mesopores. The morphology of T3@TiO2 powder was further characterized by HRTEM. In Fig. 3b, the lattice spacing of TiO2 was measured to be 0.343 nm in T3@TiO2 powder, which can be assigned to the (101) lattice facet of anatase.19 Additionally, many small black spots (the red circle) are scattered on TiO2, and the size of the spots is about 1.0 nm, just consistent with the size of Keggin anions. The morphology of T3@TiO2 powder was further characterized from the SEM images of T3@TiO2 (Fig. S7 and S8†) which indicate that the size of the composite is about 150 nm, and the distribution of size is relatively uniform. Besides, the SEM images of two kinds of photoanode films show that the pure TiO2 film is composed of uniform TiO2 particles, whereas T-doped TiO2 films contain some large particles (Fig. S9†).

The photosensitivity of T
The energy levels of T have been confirmed by the solid diffuse reflection method and cyclic voltammetry in our previous reports (Fig. S10, S11,†Fig. 4c).11 In this work, the optical band gap was obtained through the diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectrum of a powder sample. With reference to the literature method,20 a plot of Kubelka–Munk function F against energy E was drawn, in which F = (1 − R)2/2R and R is the reflectance of an infinitely thick layer at a given wavelength, shown in Fig. 4c. The band gap (Eg) is determined as the intersection point between the energy axis and the line extrapolated from the linear portion of the absorption edge in the plot of Kubelka–Munk function F against energy Eg. The Eg of T is assessed to be 2.25 eV, which is smaller than that of TiO2 (3.2 eV). UPS was done to obtain the position of the HOMO with respect to the vacuum level.21 The work function (WF) of T was found to be around 2.37 eV (21.22–18.85) by measuring the secondary electron cut off of the photoemission spectrum. By adding the binding energy of the onset of the band of occupied orbitals, the ionization energy (IE = 3.50 eV) of T was estimated, which gives the position of the HOMO (−2.37–3.50 eV = −5.87 eV) with respect to the vacuum level. Through the diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectrum and the UPS spectrum, the LUMO level of T (−3.62 eV) can be calculated.

The SPV and fluorescence emission spectra were used to study the charge transfer process at the interface of TiO2 and T. The charge transfer process of T was firstly confirmed by SPV (Fig. 4a). The SPV investigation indicates that T shows obvious light voltages at 332 nm under the condition of bias or no bias, proving that T has the nature of a semiconductor and produces effective separation of electron–hole under the condition of light excitation.22 The fluorescence emission spectrum was studied to further prove the electron transfer process between T and TiO2.23 In Fig. 4b, T has a fluorescence emission band at 360 nm upon excitation at 441 nm. When T was added into the TiO2 composite, the emission of T with a maximum at 360 nm is very efficiently quenched by TiO2, proving the photo-induced electron transmission from T to TiO2.
Performance of QDSCs
Different QDSCs were assembled by fabricating different photoanodes with pure TiO2, T1@TiO2, T2@TiO2, T3@TiO2 and T4@TiO2-doped ones combining with CdSe. The performances of the QDSCs were investigated under simulated AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) by recording the current–voltage curves (Fig. 5a and Table 1). The performances of the QDSCs with CdSe sensitized T1@TiO2, T2@TiO2, T3@TiO2 and T4@TiO2 were obviously enhanced compared to pure TiO2 and T0@TiO2 cells. The performance of the QDSCs with CdSe sensitized T0@TiO2 was slightly enhanced compared to pure TiO2. The Jsc is increased from 16.20 (pure TiO2) to 16.52 (T0@TiO2), 17.70 (T1@TiO2), 17.96 (T2@TiO2), 18.37 (T3@TiO2) and 17.56 mA cm−2 (T4@TiO2). The Voc is improved from 0.50 V (pure TiO2) to 0.55 V (T0@TiO2), 0.57 V (T1@TiO2), 0.58 V (T2@TiO2), 0.57 V (T3@TiO2) and 0.56 V (T4@TiO2). The Jsc and Voc of various photoanodes increase first and then decrease with increasing the content of T. With the increase of the amount of T, the absorption of visible light for the photoanodes is enhanced, which is the reason for the increase of the photocurrent.11 On the other hand, the increase of Jsc results from the smoother electron transmission after the doping with T and the decrease of the dark current of QDSCs. The current voltage curves under dark conditions are shown in Fig. 5c, the dark currents of T0@TiO2, T1@TiO2, T2@TiO2, T3@TiO2 and T4@TiO2-doped cells all decrease to different extents, and the dark current of the T4@TiO2-doped one no longer continues to decrease. The results show that the prepared TiO2 particles and T can all suppress electron recombination, but the effect of T was more obvious. The improvement of Voc is ascribed to the reduced carrier recombination that occurred at the interface of FTO/electrolyte and TiO2/dye/electrolyte. The Jsc and Voc begin to decrease as the concentration continues to increase in photoanodes, demonstrating that the effect of POM on the performance of QDSCs is dependent on the amount of the POM.24 The reason may come from the fact that excessive POM will be easy to gather on the surface of titanium dioxide, which will increase the charge transfer impedance.25 When adding the prepared T3@TiO2 composite into photoanodes, an energy conversion efficiency of 6.59% was obtained.

To further investigate the enhancement of the Jsc value of T and CdSe cosensitized cells, the monochromatic incident photon to carrier conversion efficiency (IPCE) was used to evaluate the photocurrent response to incident light. As shown in Fig. 5b, for all devices, the onset positions of the photocurrents in IPCE curves were well matched with those of the corresponding absorption spectra as shown in Fig. S13.† For the CdSe sensitized pure TiO2 and T0@TiO2 cells, an IPCE of ∼68% in the range of 350–650 nm was observed as shown in Fig. 5b. But a wider response range (350–700 nm) was found for CdSe sensitized T@TiO2 (T1@TiO2, T2@TiO2, T3@TiO2, and T4@TiO2) cells and the values of IPCE were ∼77%, ∼78%, ∼83% and ∼77% for CdSe sensitized T1@TiO2, T2@TiO2, T3@TiO2 and T4@TiO2 cells, respectively. It can be summarized that T added to the photoanodes as a collaborative cosensitizer could both utilize more sunlight and accelerate the electron transport in the photoanode.26
The charge separation process for the TiO2 electrode sensitized collaboratively by T and CdSe is shown in Fig. 7. Firstly, the CdSe quantum dots would result in the electron transfer from the valence band to the conduction band under excitation of light theoretically, thus yielding electron–hole pairs. The electron–hole pairs will produce electron recombination or electron transfer. While the CdSe quantum dots were sensitized collaboratively by T, the excited state photoelectrons will be injected from the conduction band of the CdSe quantum dots to the conduction band of T or TiO2. Secondly, the electrons were collected by T and T becomes heteropoly blue at the same time, and soon the electrons were transferred to the conduction band of TiO2, which can suppress the excited electron back-flow with the electrolyte or the hole of CdSe and reduce the resistance of electron injection.27 Furthermore, the most important of all is that T owing to its smaller band gap, which was introduced to the TiO2, can constitute a wide spectrum of absorption, so that collaborative cosensitization can produce more photoelectrons injected into the TiO2 and improve the visible photocurrent response. T can also absorb light and reach its excited state, and deliver the photoelectrons to the conduction band of TiO2, which can be deduced from our previous study.11 Such collaborative cosensitization increased visible light absorption and utilization, enhanced the spatial separation of electron–hole pairs to improve the electron injection efficiency, suppressed the electron–hole pair recombination and therefore contributed to the final improved conversion efficiency.

Open circuit voltage decay (OCVD)
The open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements were carried out to study the recombination of electrons with the electrolytes by measuring the decay of Voc after turning off the illumination in a steady state.28 The experimental result indicates that the introduction of T to the photoanodes results in a longer electron lifetime. Fig. 5d shows the OCVD curves of the QDSCs with T@TiO2-doped, and pure TiO2 photoanodes. It can be concluded from Fig. 5d that the Voc of the QDSCs with T@TiO2-doped photoanodes decays more slowly than that of pure TiO2, which indicates that their charge recombination rate is much slower. The OCVD curves are further used to evaluate the electron lifetime of T@TiO2 and pure TiO2 photoanodes in the QDSCs by the formula τn = (kT/e) × (dv/dt)−1. As can be seen from Fig. S12,† the electron lifetime of CdSe sensitized pure TiO2 and T0@TiO2 cells (inset in the Fig. S12†) is obviously less than that of CdSe sensitized T@TiO2 (T1@TiO2, T2@TiO2, T3@TiO2, T4@TiO2) cells. With the increase of the amount of T, the electron lifetime of CdSe sensitized T3@TiO2 cells is the longest. When the amount of T continues to increase, the electron lifetime begins to shorten. This can prove that the concentration of T3@TiO2 assembled into photoanodes is the optimal amount.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the intrinsic mechanism of the improved photovoltaic performance of CdSe sensitized T@TiO2 cells.29 Herein, the charge transmission and recombination processes of CdSe sensitized T@TiO2 and pure TiO2 cells were evaluated by EIS, in which a different forward bias is applied in the dark with the frequency ranging from 105 to 0.1 Hz. As can be see from Fig. 6c, the large semicircle represented the recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface and the chemical capacitance of the TiO2 film (Cμ) in mid/low frequency ranges.3f,30Cμ mainly depicted the capability of a system to accept or release additional carriers due to a change in the Fermi level and consequently reflected the density of states.31 The date from Nyquist plots was fitted using Z-view software by using the equivalent circuit diagram in the inset of Fig. 6c.
The relationship between Cμ or Rrec and the different applied bias voltages is presented in Fig. 6a and b. From Fig. 6a, the results showed that both CdSe sensitized T@TiO2 and pure TiO2 cells had nearly identical Cμ values under the same forward bias, and the T added into the photoanodes as a collaborative cosensitizer did not change the conduction band edge of TiO2 under the same forward bias.6a Beyond that the Rrec decreases with increasing applied bias voltages for all the devices as shown in Fig. 6b. The reason was that the Fermi level of TiO2 elevated at the forward bias is beneficial for the electron flow across the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface.32 From the results shown in Fig. 6b, there is an apparent difference in the Rrec values between CdSe sensitized pure TiO2 and T@TiO2 (T1@TiO2, T2@TiO2, T3@TiO2 and T4@TiO2) cells and the Rrec value of T0@TiO2 is slightly larger than that of the pure TiO2 under identical forward bias. The Rrec is inversely proportional to the recombination rate; so the greater Rrec value means a reduced charge recombination rate.29 The reasons are as follows: the increase of Rrec when T is added into the photoanodes confirmed that T plays a role in inhibiting electron recombination at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interfaces. However, continuous increase of the content of T will result in the decrease of Rrec, which may come from the reason that the T began to gather on the surface of titanium dioxide to hinder the electronic transmission.24,25 Besides, we find results from the experiment that the prepared TiO2 particles are also conducive to suppress electron recombination. Fig. 6c gives a direct comparison of the CdSe sensitized T@TiO2 and pure TiO2 cells at a forward bias near the open-circuit voltage and the fitted data of Rrec and Cμ are listed in Table S1.† From the analysis of the data in Table S1† it can be concluded that the Rrec values of CdSe sensitized T3@TiO2 cells (310 Ω cm−2) are higher than those of the CdSe sensitized pure TiO2 cells (49 Ω cm−2) and T0@TiO2 (65 Ω cm−2).
Conclusions
In conclusion, we chose a wide spectrum and pure inorganic D–A type POM cluster as the collaborative cosensitizer assembled on the photoanodes of the QDSCs. XRD, solid diffuse spectra, XPS, EDS analysis, TEM methods were used to characterize the composites, which demonstrates that T was successfully assembled on the TiO2 and uniformly dispersed on TiO2. The fluorescence emission spectra and the surface photovoltage spectra were used to confirm the charge transfer process between T and TiO2. The performances of QDSCs have significant enhancements with the composites assembled in the photoanodes of the QDSCs. The overall conversion efficiency of T and CdSe cosensitized solar cells was improved by 32.33% compared to those of the pure CdSe-sensitized cells. The results show that the wide spectrum and D–A type POM can make up for the defect of CdSe QDs to constitute a wide spectrum of absorption. In addition, it can act as a good intermediate for the injection of electrons and improve the visible photocurrent response, meanwhile, it can obviously reduce the dark current and increase the electron lifetime. More importantly, the present work takes the first step for using D–A type POMs as the potential substitutes for dyes of high efficiency QDSCs. Further studies about D–A type POMs are in progress.
