    , Accepted 11th October 2021First published on 12th October 2021AbstractThe air stable tin(IV) complex [Me2Sn{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}2] has been synthesized, characterized by NMR, elemental analysis, and single crystal XRD, and employed as a single source molecular precursor (SSP) for the facile synthesis of orthorhombic SnSe nanosheets. The crystal structure, phase purity, morphology and band gap of the nanosheets were investigated by pXRD, EDS, electron microscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy techniques, respectively. It was found that the preferential orientation of planes and the morphology of the nanosheets rely upon the reaction conditions. The band gaps of the nanosheets were blue shifted with respect to the bulk band gap of the material. The synthesized SnSe nanosheets have been employed as an anode material in lithium ion batteries (LIBs). The material exhibits an initial specific capacity of 1134 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 and was found to retain a capacity of 380 mA h g−1 even after 70 cycles with 100% efficiency.
Introduction
Escalating consumption of Earth's resources and subsequent interest in green technologies has fuelled a great deal of research on new materials with fascinating morphologies for efficient energy conversion and storage devices. Nanomaterials having 2D sheet like morphologies are key contributors towards sustainable means of energy conversion and storage due to their unprecedented applications in solar cells, batteries, memory switching devices and thermoelectrics.1 Graphene, being a classical example of a 2D material, has been extensively studied and exhibits unique properties.2 Beyond graphene, 2D layered metal chalcogenides have also emerged as a contemporary and suitable class of materials with remarkable electronic band structure and tailor-made layer dependent properties.3 Among them, tin chalcogenides, SnEx (E = S, Se, and Te; x = 1 or 2), provide an important class of materials with promising applications in photonics and sustainable electronics. Tin selenides, being less toxic compared to conventional lead and cadmium-based chalcogenides, have surfaced as promising members of this family. Tin forms two narrow band gap selenides namely SnSe and SnSe2. SnSe, a p-type semiconductor, crystallizes in an orthorhombic lattice with an optical bulk band gap of 1.3 eV (direct) and 0.9 eV (indirect)4 whereas SnSe2, an n-type material, has a CdI2 type hexagonal crystal structure with a bulk band gap of 1.84 eV (direct) and 1.07 eV (indirect).5 SnSe has shown great promise in photovoltaics, optoelectronics and thermoelectric devices owing to its distinct optical properties and structural anisotropy.6 Moreover, SnSe has also drawn attention as a promising anode material for applications in Li-ion batteries (LIBs).7 Commercial LIBs make use of graphene as the anode material which possesses a limiting capacity of 372 mA h g−1.7a Sn atom, on the contrary, is known to upgrade the capacity of LIBs by alloying with Li+ ions to form Li4.4Sn which shows a theoretical capacity of 994 mA h g−1.8 Moreover, the reversible alloying and dealloying of Sn with Li with a high volumetric capacity of 2020 mA h cm−3 along with high electrical conductivity makes it a worthy candidate for LIB application.9 Prone to oxidation and high energy loss for elemental Sn and SnO2, respectively, makes them less interesting for such applications; hence, SnSe becomes the natural choice for the same.10 Though limited, one of the earlier studies on SnSe as an anode material for LIBs shows promising results with a capacity of 400 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles.11 In a recent study, Im et al. have reported a capacity of 510 mA h g−1 after 70 cycles at 0.1 C (ref. 7a) whereas Biswas and coworkers have achieved an initial discharge capacity of 1000 mA h g−1 and showed 92% capacity retention after 50 cycles at a specific current of 100 mA g−1.12 It has been observed that the performance of SnSe in LIBs greatly depends upon its morphology which in turn relies on the synthetic strategy adopted.9
Over the years, various routes have been adopted for the synthesis of SnSe nanostructures. The solution phase synthesis of nanoparticles includes the hot injection, aqueous and solvothermal approaches etc.13 Solvent free methods for the preparation of SnSe nanostructures or thin films include high energy milling, flash evaporation, thermal evaporation, APCVD, PVD, AACVD and plasma assisted direct current discharge methods.14 In general, these methods are classified as dual or multiple source methods that demand a tin source (typically elemental Sn, SnCl4, SnCl2, Sn6O4(OH)4, Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2, tin-oleate complex etc.) along with a separate selenium source (elemental Se, SeO2, selenourea, TOPSe, N-monosubstituted and N,N′-disubstituted imidazolidine selones etc.) for the preparation of SnSe nanostructures. In contrast to dual source methods, single source precursor (SSP) routes are often proved to be advantageous due to preformed bonds between the constituent elements which lead to better stoichiometry, lower defect concentration and morphology control.15 Moreover, the SSP route is equally viable for both nanomaterial synthesis and deposition of thin films.16 Only a handful of SSPs have been reported to date for the preparation of phase pure tin selenide nanostructures. Some earlier works include the synthesis of SnSe nanoparticles by Bahr et al. by employing (Ph2SnSe)3 as a molecular precursor.17 Boudjouk and coworkers have employed the organotin complex (Bz3Sn)2Se (Bz = benzyl) for the preparation of microcrystalline SnSe which was contaminated with elemental Sn18 whereas [Sn(SeC5H4N)2]2 was utilized by Cheng et al. to synthesize SnSe nanomaterial.19 In some recent studies, Ahmet et al. have utilized tin(IV)bisguanidinate mono chalcogenide complexes as SSPs for the preparation of SnSe20 whereas Revaprasadu and coworkers have employed [Bu2Sn(PhCOSe)2] as a precursor for SnSe thin films.14f Previously, our group have reported several diorganotin complexes with internally functionalized hemilabile ligands like 4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrimidyl, 5-methyl-2-pyridyl, 3-methyl-2-pyridyl and 2-pyridylselenolates which were successfully utilized as molecular precursors for either SnSe or SnSe2 nanomaterials and thin films depending on the nature of the substituent on tin or the ligand.21
In this investigation, synthesis and thorough characterization of a new SSP bis(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)dimethyltin selenolate, [Me2Sn{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}2] derived from a new symmetrical diselenide namely bis(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)diselenide have been presented and employed the same for the preparation of phase pure SnSe nanomaterials with a 2D sheet like morphology. Control over the composition and morphology of the synthesized SnSe nanosheets under varying reaction conditions is also presented herein. Detailed characterization of the nanosheets was performed using pXRD, SEM, EDS, TEM and HRTEM. The application of nanosheets as an efficient anode material for LIBs has been demonstrated. In the present study, an economical and environmentally friendly SnSe anode has been fabricated using a water soluble binder (sodium alginate) at ambient conditions, for the first time, rather than the commonly used binder (polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)). Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is hardly any report of using SnSe nanosheets obtained from molecular precursors as an anode material for LIB applications.
Experimental
Dimethyltindichloride, oleylamine (OAm), 1-octadecene (ODE), 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) and analytical grade solvents were procured from commercial sources. Bis(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)diselenide was prepared according to a similar method adopted for the synthesis of bis(5-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)diselenide with slight modifications.22
Elemental analyses were carried out using a Thermo Fischer Flash EA-1112 CHNS analyser. The 1H, 13C{1H} and 77Se{1H} NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance-II NMR spectrometer operating at 300, 75.47 and 57.24 MHz, respectively. The chemical shifts are relative to the internal chloroform peak in the 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra and the external Ph2Se2 (δ: 463 ppm relative to Me2Se) peak in CDCl3 in the 77Se{1H} NMR spectra.
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out using a Nitzsch STA 409 PC-Luxx TG-DTA instrument that was calibrated with CaC2O4·H2O. The TG curves were recorded at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a flow of argon. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns were obtained using a Philips PW-1820 diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. Optical diffuse reflectance measurements in the range 200–1100 nm (1.12 eV to 6.2 eV) were performed using a JASCO V-670 two-beam spectrometer with a diffuse reflectance (DR) attachment consisting of an integration sphere coated with BaSO4 which was used as the reference material. The measured reflectance data were converted to absorption (A) using the Kubelka–Munk remission function.23 The band gaps of the samples were estimated by extrapolating the linear portion of the plot to X (energy) axis. SEM and EDS measurements were carried out using an ULTRA 55 FESEM of Zeiss and Oxford Inca instruments, respectively. A Zeiss Libra 200 FE transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV was used for TEM studies. The samples for TEM and SAED were prepared by placing a drop of sample dispersed in acetone/toluene on a carbon coated copper grid.
Intensity data for [Me2Sn{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}2] (1) were collected at room temperature (298 ± 2 K) using a Rigaku AFC7S diffractometer using graphite monochromated Mo-Kα (λ = 0.71069 Å) radiation so that θmax = 27.5°. The unit cell parameters (Table 1) were determined from 25 reflections measured by a random search routine. The intensity data were corrected for Lorentz, polarization and absorption effects using an empirical procedure.24 The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELX-9725 and refined by the full-matrix least squares methods. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were fixed in their calculated positions. Molecular structures were drawn using ORTEP.26

Synthesis of bis(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)diselenide
To a vigorously stirred mixture of freshly ground selenium (1.8 g, 22.8 mmol) in distilled water (50 ml), NaBH4 (862 mg, 22.8 mmol) was added in small portions. The solution was warmed and stirred for 2 h until a clear red solution appears. To this solution, 2-bromo-4,6-dimethylpyridine (2.12 g, 11.4 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 6 h. The crude diselenide was extracted using diethyl ether, washed with water and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The absence of monoselenide was checked by TLC and the crude product was purified by column chromatography after the removal of the solvent using 60–120 mesh silica gel and hexane–ethyl acetate (5:1) as an eluent. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to yield a solid yellow product (yield: 3.4 g, 81.4%), m.p. 58 °C. Anal. Calcd for C14H16N2Se2: C, 45.42; H, 4.35; N, 7.56%.

Synthesis of [Me2Sn{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}2] (1)
To a methanolic solution of sodium 4,6-dimethyl-2-pyridyl selenolate [prepared by the reduction of bis(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)diselenide (200 mg, 0.54 mmol) by a methanolic solution of NaBH4 (40.8 mg, 1.08 mmol)], a toluene solution of Me2SnCl2 (118.6 mg, 0.54 mmol) was added with stirring that continued for 2 hours at room temperature. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the residue was extracted with dichloromethane and filtered. The filtrate was reduced (4 ml) and toluene was added which on slow evaporation afforded colourless crystals of the title complex (yield: 207 mg, 74%), m.p. 132 °C. Anal. calcd for C16H22N2Se2Sn; C: 37.03, H: 4.27, N: 5.39%.

Preparation of tin selenide nanostructures
Tin selenide nanostructures were synthesized by pyrolysis or thermolysis of [Me2Sn{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}2] (1). Five sets of experiments were carried out to study the effect of the reaction conditions and solvents on the phase purity of the nanostructures. In the case of pyrolysis, the title complex was placed in an alumina boat and heated at 300 °C for 30 minutes under flowing argon to afford a black residue. For the thermolysis approach, 8 ml of a high boiling solvent (OAm, ODE, DDT and OAm + DDT (1:1, v/v)) was taken in a three-necked round bottomed flask and degassed at 120 °C under nitrogen flow for 30 min. The temperature was then increased to 300 °C and then the required amount of 1 (150 mg, 0.29 mmol) dispersed in 2 ml of the same solvent was swiftly injected into the preheated solvent under vigorous stirring. After 30 minutes of reaction time at 300 °C, the solution was rapidly cooled down to 60 °C and an excess amount of methanol (5 ml) was added into the mixture. The resulting nanocrystals were separated by centrifugation and purified by washing several times with a mixture of methanol and toluene.
Cell fabrication and electrochemical characterization
The as-prepared tin selenide nanosheets synthesized by pyrolysis was mixed with super P carbon black and the water soluble binder sodium alginate in a weight ratio of 70:20:10, respectively, to form a consistent slurry. This slurry was then uniformly coated on a clean copper foil (1 × 1 cm) which is then used as a current collector. These electrodes were then allowed to dry in a preheated oven at 50 °C for about 8 h. The mass loading was controlled to be 3.0–3.5 mg cm2. The electrochemical characterization was performed using a CR2032 type coin cell with lithium metal as a counter electrode and reference electrode. These cells were fabricated in an Ar-filled glove box (MBRAUN). A Whatman Glass Microfiber Filter GF/D (product no. 1823-047) separator was used with 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as an electrolyte. Before electrochemical characterization, the cells were sealed inside a glove box and were kept for 24 h to attain equilibrium. Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements for the cells were evaluated using a NEWARE battery charging unit (NEWARE Technology Ltd, Shenzhen, China) at different current densities within the voltage range of 0.01–3 V (vs. Li/Li+). Cyclic voltammetry was carried out with an electrochemical workstation OrigaFlex OGF 500 (Origalys, France) within a potential window of 0.01–3.0 V at different scanning rates. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a Novocontrol Alpha-A high frequency analyzer with 50 mV AC voltage in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. The EIS measurements were analyzed using the ZView 2.9b software.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and NMR spectroscopy
The preparation of the diselenide was carried out according to Scheme 1. The synthesis was carried out in aqueous media wherein 2-bromo-4,6-dimethylpyridine was reacted with Na2Se2 (prepared in situ using Se powder and NaBH4) with refluxing for 6 h. The extraction was carried out in diethylether which upon evaporation produces bis(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)diselenide as a sticky yellow solid.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of bis(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)diselenide. 
Colorless crystals of the title complex 1 were obtained by the reaction of sodium 4,6-dimethyl-2-pyridyl selenolate with dimethyltindichloride in a 2:1 molar ratio in a toluene–methanol mixture (Scheme 2). Both the ligand and the complex were characterized by elemental analysis and NMR spectroscopy. The 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra show the expected resonances and peak multiplicities. The chemical shifts of the pyridyl ring protons of 1 are shifted upfield as compared to their diselenide counterparts. The 77Se{1H} NMR spectrum of 1 features a single resonance peak at 201.7 ppm confirming the absence of any other selenium containing species. The 77Se signal of 1 is shifted upfield with respect to that of the ligand (77Se{1H} NMR δ: 433.9 ppm) (ESI Fig. S1 and S2†). The former is flanked by tin satellites with the 1J(119Sn–77Se and 117Sn–77Se) coupling constants ranging between 614 and 641 Hz which is indicative of a direct bond between tin and selenium.
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of [Me2Sn{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}2] (1). 
The magnitude of 2J(119Sn–1H) of the complex was calculated to be 75.9 Hz which is lower than that expected for six coordinated dimethyltin complexes whereas the magnitude of 1J(119Sn–13C) (∼559 Hz) is higher than those reported for four coordinated diorganotin(IV) complexes.27 The C–Sn–C angles in 1 was estimated to be 125° using the following equation as reported by Lockhart and Davidson.28|1J(119Sn–13C)| = 10.7 (∠C–Sn–C) − 778
The C–Sn–C value of 1 (125° from NMR analysis) can be compared with the one determined by X-ray structural analysis (131.4(7)°) suggesting that the solid state structure of the complex is retained in solution.
X-ray crystallography
Diffraction quality colorless crystals of 1 were obtained by slow evaporation of the solvent from a dichloromethane solution of the complex. The molecular structure of 1 with an atomic numbering scheme is shown in Fig. 1a. The crystallographic and structural determination data and refinement parameters are given in Table 1 and the selected inter-atomic parameters are given in Table 2.

The complex crystallizes in dichloromethane with an orthorhombic crystal system in the space group Pnam and the unit cell contains four complex molecules (Fig. 1b). The tin atom of the complex lies on a two fold rotation axis whose geometry is defined by two –Me groups and two –Se atoms from two 4,6-dimethyl-2-pyridyl selenolate ligands. The geometry around tin can be considered as distorted trapezoidal bipyramidal. The overall configuration around the tin atoms is similar to the dimethyltin 2-pyridyl and 5-methyl-2-pyridyl selenolates, [Me2Sn(2-SeC5H4N)2] and [Me2Sn{2-SeC5H3(Me-5)N}2], previously reported by our group.21a,c The structure of the complex can also be related to the analogous thiolato complex, [Me2Sn(SC5H4N)2].29 The two intramolecular tin–nitrogen interactions are weak in nature, by virtue of which, interactions resembling chelation are introduced in the system, thereby stabilizing the complex. This is supported by the fact that both the Sn–N distances are longer than the sum of their covalent radii (∼2.15 Å) but are smaller than the sum of their van der Waals radii (∼3.72 Å). It is important to note that the NMR studies indicate a coordination number less than six around tin. So the weak interactions observed in the solid state are vanishingly present in solution. Both the Sn–Se distances in 1 are exactly the same (2.614(5) Å) and are comparable to a majority of analogous diorganotin 4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrimidyl, 5-methyl-2-pyridyl and 2-pyridyl selenolates.21 However, they are somewhat shorter than those reported for 1∞[Sn(SePh)2] (the average Sn–Se distance is ∼2.67 Å)30 and [Sn(SeC5H4N)2]2 (the average Sn–Se distance is ∼2.72 Å).19 The Sn–C distances (2.116(5) and 2.121(6) Å) are also in accordance with the similar diorganotin pyridyl and pyrimidyl complexes21,29 and also to some similar types of complexes, e.g. [Me2Sn(SC5H4N)2] (∼2.13 Å) and [Me2Sn(C9H6NO)2] (∼2.15 Å).29,31 The N–Sn–N and Se–Sn–Se angles in 1 (143.50 and 91.57(2)° respectively) are shrunk as compared to the same in [Me2Sn(SeC5H4N)2] (152.1(2) and 94.25(8)°)21a but the latter is relatively widened as compared to the S–Sn–S angle in the analogous thio complex, bis[3-(2-pyridyl)-2-thienyl]di-p-tolylstannane (86.91(7)°), which is plausibly the manifestation of coordination through less bulky S atom.32 The bite angle of the ligand, i.e. N–Sn–Se (62.46°) is also quite smaller as compared to analogous dimethyltin complexes with unsubstituted 2-selenopyridyl ligands.21a
The crystal packing diagram of 1 is shown in Fig. 2a. The view along the X-axis shows that the [Me2Sn{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}2] moieties are connected together in the 3D structure through short contacts involving the C1 atoms of one asymmetric unit and the C6–H6B atoms of the other two asymmetric units. The C6–H6B⋯C1 distances (2.792 Å) are shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the two concerned atoms (2.9 Å). A conclusion can thus be drawn that these asymmetric units are interlinked together by strong non-bonding secondary interactions. Moreover, these asymmetric units are not parallel and rather make an angle of 30.39° between two adjacent layers when viewed along the Z-axis, making a zig-zag chain like assembly as shown in Fig. 2b. These repetitive assemblies are connected to each other by weak van der Waals forces which are confirmed by the absence of any short contacts or hydrogen bonding between them.

A thermal analysis of the title complex was performed to observe its thermal stability. Moreover the thermogravimetry (TG) study also provides valuable information about the composition of the residue formed during the decomposition. From the TG and DTG plots presented in the Fig. 3, it was inferred that the complex is stable up to 285 °C, beyond which it undergoes a single step decomposition leading to the formation of SnSe (weight loss observed was 61.4%, weight loss calculated for the formation of SnSe was 61.9%). Furthermore, it was also observed that there was a gradual weight loss even after 400 °C which may be due to the loss of Se. Previously, it has been reported that Se volatilizes at higher temperatures.33

The pXRD pattern of the residue obtained at the end of the TG experiment could not be correlated either to Sn or SnSe (ESI Fig. S3†). In order to investigate the decomposition behavior and to confirm the Se loss from SnSe, the precursor was separately heated in a furnace upto 400 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 under flowing argon. The residue obtained after heating in the furnace was characterized by pXRD which corresponds to the formation of SnSe (Fig. 3 inset). This proves that the weight loss in TG beyond 400 °C was due to the loss of Se. The TG study indicates that the synthesized complex could be a useful precursor for the preparation of the SnSe nanomaterial.
Preparation and characterization of tin selenide nanostructures
Gaining insights from the TG study, complex 1 was employed as a single source molecular precursor for the preparation of tin selenide nanostructures. The nanostructures were synthesized by furnace heating (pyrolysis) and by thermolysis of 1, separately in different high boiling solvents like OAm, ODE, DDT and a combination of DDT and OAm (1:1, v/v). The selection of solvent was made on the basis of their varying coordinating ability and reducing nature. For instance, ODE being devoid of any functional group, acts as a weak coordinating agent with negligible reducing ability. In contrast, the presence of amine and thiol groups in OAm and DDT, respectively, makes them better capping agents. In addition to this, OAm is known for its reducing abilities at elevated temperatures.34
The nanostructures were synthesized either by pyrolysis of the title complex at 300 °C in a furnace under Ar atmosphere for 30 minutes or by the hot injection method (thermolysis) where the solution of the complex was swiftly injected into a pre-heated solvent and after 30 minutes of reaction, the residue was separated by centrifugation and purified. It is worth mentioning that negligible decomposition of the complex was observed at temperatures below 300 °C. The crystal structure, morphology, homogeneity and optical band gap of the residue were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS), SEM, TEM, selective area electron diffraction (SAED) technique and solid state diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.
The pXRD pattern of the materials synthesized by employing 1 in a furnace, ODE and OAm features reflections that can be assigned to the formation of phase pure orthorhombic SnSe nanoparticles (JCPDS 48-1224), whereas the presence of DDT in the reaction system leads to the formation of a mixture of orthorhombic SnSe and hexagonal SnSe2. This could be attributed to the presence of the –SH group in DDT which at elevated temperatures or in the presence of a base like OAm features both a thiol (–SH) group and thiolate (–S−) moiety. The simultaneous presence of the thiol and thiolate capping agents in the reaction mixture could be responsible for the formation of a mixture of products shown in Fig. 4g. A broad pXRD peak that appeared between 28.6° and 31.8° in the case of the material synthesized exclusively in DDT is actually a result of three overlapping reflections at 30.4° and 31.1° corresponding to the planes (111) and (400) of SnSe, respectively, and 30.6° corresponding to the (101) plane of SnSe2 as distinguished from the deconvolution of the diffraction profile using Gaussian–Lorentzian cross-product (amplitude) curves (ESI Fig. S4†). Since phase pure nanomaterials were not isolated in the case of DDT (EDS analysis; Sn:Se = 1:1.25) and OAm + DDT mixture (1:1, v/v) (EDS analysis; Sn:Se = 1:1.53) (ESI Fig. S5†), these products were ruled out for further studies. The pXRD results of the materials synthesized in furnace, OAm and ODE are very well supported by the EDS results (Sn:Se atom ratio; 1:1.01; 1:1.18 and 1.16:1 for materials synthesized in furnace, OAm and ODE, respectively) (ESI Fig. S6†) (Table 3).

From the pXRD patterns, it is also inferred that the presence of OAm has a marked effect on the preferred orientation of the nanosheets. In OAm, the reflection corresponding to the (400) plane appears to be the most intense peak in contrast to all the other decompositions where a more prominent reflection from the (111) plane was observed. A similar kind of effect of OAm on the preferential growth of the (400) plane as compared to the (111) plane in tin selenide and for other materials was observed in previous studies as well.14f,35 The lattice parameters were calculated by the least square fitting method and were found to be consistent with the literature value (Table 3). The average crystallite sizes calculated using the Scherrer formula were found out to be ∼44.4, 44.6 and 52.1 nm for materials synthesized in furnace, ODE and OAm, respectively.
To confirm whether Sn and Se are homogeneously distributed in the samples, 2-D elemental imaging of all the nanostructures were performed which showed uniform distribution of the constituent elements (ESI Fig. S7†).
The morphology of the SnSe nanosheets obtained from 1 was evaluated by electron microscopic studies. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of nanostructures obtained from furnace heating depict the formation of rectangular sheets which get agglomerated to give the spherical appearance (Fig. 5a). The SEM micrographs presented in Fig. 5b and c represented the formation of hexagonal nanosheets of average thickness 60 and 85 nm synthesized in OAm and ODE, respectively. Interestingly, the hexagonal nanosheets prepared in OAm feature sharp and defined edges, whereas those synthesized in ODE have soft edges. The agglomeration of nanosheets in the case of the material synthesized in the furnace can be easily understood as no capping agent was involved. Furthermore, OAm is known to coordinate nanomaterials through its lone pair of electrons.33 In contrast, ODE, having no functional group, caps the nanomaterials by the terminal alkene (vinyl) group.36 In a recent study, Dhaene et al. have reported the temperature dependent autopolymerization of ODE which starts at 120 °C and saturates at 320 °C with all the ODE being converted into poly(ODE).37 As the decomposition was performed by the hot injection method at 300 °C, it would be harmless to assume that all the ODE was converted into poly(ODE), thereby reducing its capping ability. The difference in the preferred orientation of nanosheets along the (400) and (111) planes and therefore the morphological difference between the materials synthesized in OAm and ODE, respectively, are thus plausible manifestations of the difference in the coordination mechanism of OAm and ODE with the nanoparticles. The bright field TEM images of nanosheets (Fig. 6a–c) obtained upon the decomposition of the complex in furnace revealed the formation of soft edged rectangular sheets, whereas hexagonal sheets with sharp edges and nearly hexagonal discs with soft edges were observed in the case of nanosheets obtained by the thermolysis of the complex in OAm and ODE, respectively. The interplanar distances of 2.94, 2.95 and 2.91 Å calculated from HRTEM images (Fig. 6d–f) for these samples correspond to the (111) crystal plane of orthorhombic SnSe (JCPDS 48-1224). The results are in agreement with the peaks observed in the pXRD patterns. In the corresponding SAED pattern shown in ESI Fig. S8,† well-defined discrete spots were obtained which are indicative of the highly crystalline nature of the nanosheets.

 Fig. 6  TEM and HRTEM images of SnSe nanosheets obtained by the (a and d) pyrolysis of 1 and thermolysis of 1 in (b and e) OAm and (c and f) ODE, respectively. 
It is quite interesting to note that nanosheets of SnSe were obtained by both pyrolysis and thermolysis (furnace heated or decomposing in high boiling solvents with varying coordination abilities and reducing powers). The formation of nanosheets in all the cases can be explained on the basis of the intrinsic structure of SnSe. It adopts a distorted orthorhombic layered structure with each Sn covalently coordinated to three Se and vice versa whereas adjacent layers are associated together by weak van der Waals forces of interaction (Fig. 7a). This kind of arrangement of atoms in layers and weak interaction between the adjacent layers facilitates the formation of materials having sheet like appearances.

Optical properties
SnSe nanostructures are narrow band gap semiconductors and have played a pivotal role in solar cells and LIBs. It is realized that the optimum band gap of the material is crucial for these applications. For instance, ideal anode materials for LIBs require good ionic diffusivity and electronic conductivity along with large potential and high capacity.38 The band gap of a material provides important insights into its electronic conductivity. It is reported that materials having band gaps below 2.7 eV generally possess good electronic conductivity. Realising this, the band gap of the nanosheets were measured by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) using a plot of Kubelka–Munk function, F(R) as given in the following equation[F(R)hν]n = A(hν − Eg)where hν = photon energy, A is a constant, Eg represents the band gap and n depends on the nature of the optical transition. The direct band gaps of SnSe nanosheets were evaluated using Tauc's plot (n = 2) which were found to be in the range of 1.68–1.78 eV (Fig. 8a). The Davis–Mott model (for n = 1/2) was employed to determine the indirect band gap of SnSe nanosheets which were in the range of 1.34–1.38 eV (Fig. 8b). These values are blue shifted with respect to the bulk counterpart of SnSe (Eg (direct) = 1.3 eV and Eg (indirect) = 0.9 eV).39 The increase in the band gap value of the synthesized materials may either be due to quantum confinement or surface lattice defects or lattice distortion. For example, Franzman et al. and Pejova et al. have demonstrated the effects of quantum confinement in SnSe nanocrystals of average grain size of 14–20 nm.4,40 In some earlier studies, our group has also reported a band gap value of 1.46–2.0 eV for SnSe.21b,c It is to be noted that the Bohr's radius of SnSe is ∼23 nm.41 Since in the present case, the thickness of the SnSe nanosheet is quite larger than its corresponding Bohr's radius, the presence of quantum confinement is improbable and the blue shift in the band gap values compared to the bulk can be attributed to either lattice distortion or surface lattice defects. Nonetheless, a band gap value of less than 2.7 eV of the SnSe nanosheets synthesized in the present scenario indicates that they possess good electronic conductivity and can be utilized as a suitable candidate for anode material in LIBs. Considering the average crystallite size and the absence of a capping agent, the SnSe nanomaterial synthesized by pyrolysis was chosen as an exemplary material in order to evaluate its potential as an anode material for LIBs.

Li-Ion battery application
Tin selenide nanostructures are considered to be promising anode materials in battery applications due to their high specific capacity, fast lithiation kinetics and appreciable cycle stability.7,42 This work focuses on the evaluation of SnSe synthesized via the SSP pathway as an anode material in lithium ion batteries. The electrochemical performances have been examined by cyclic voltameter (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements. Here the combination of SnSe with metallic lithium as a counter electrode was assembled in the CR 2032 type half-cell configuration. The CV curves for the first three cycles were recorded at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. 9a) and also at different scan rates as shown in Fig. 9b. During the first sweep, some prominent cathodic peaks appeared at ∼1.63, 1.46, 1.2, and 0.6 V and anodic peaks appeared at ∼0.63, 1.16, 1.84, and 2.19 V. The first three reduction peaks observed in the first cycle correspond to the lithiation of SnSe (LixSnSe) and the decomposition of LixSnSe to Li2Se and Sn (SnSe + Li = LixSnSe = Li2Se + Sn).7a,43 The reduction peak at ∼0.6 V is ascribed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer.44 The hump at 0.4 V corresponds to the alloying of Li and Sn to form LixSn. In the anodic scan, the peak at 0.63 V is attributed to the dealloying of LixSn to Li and Sn. The oxidation peak at 1.16 V is due to lithium extraction from the carbon present in the sample. Another anodic peak at 1.84 V corresponds to the reaction of Li2Se and Sn which forms SnSe (Li2Se + Sn = SnSe + Li).45 The peaks of subsequent cycles do not match with the first cycle. In the next cycles, the cathodic peak appears at 1.28 V and the anodic peaks appear at ∼1.2 and 1.85 V. The cathodic peak (1.28 V) corresponds to the formation of Li2Se and Sn. Zhang et al. reported that this peak appears at 1.32 V in the second cycle. In the next anodic sweep, the peaks at 1.2 and 1.85 V correspond to the delithiation of Li2Se and the formation of SnSe and Li.7a There is a slight shift in the peak position with the increase in the number of cycles which was observed from the CV in Fig. 9a and b. This can be attributed to the increase in Li–Sn alloying. The decrease in capacity with cycle number may be due to the dissolution of polyselenides and the loss of active materials from the aluminum electrode.7b,43,46

The cycling and coulombic efficiency test shown in Fig. 9c of the active material was performed in the voltage range 0.01–3.0 V. It can be evaluated that the columbic efficiency was nearly 90% and 76% for the first cycle at the current density of 50 and 100 mA g−1, respectively. The first cycle charge–discharge capacity was found to be 1134 and 809 mA h g−1 at 50 and 100 mA g−1, respectively (Fig. 9c and e). The cell was subjected to 70 cycles at 50 and 100 mA g−1. The obtained initial capacity at 50 and 100 mA g−1 are almost similar. However, the cell could retain a higher capacity when cycled at a relatively lower current density i.e. 50 mA g−1 (Fig. 9d). The capacity of SnSe was found to be 809, 1134, 202, 389, 100, and 45 mA h g−1 at different current densities in the range of 50 to 400 mA g−1 as shown in Fig. 9d. It was observed that when cycled at 250 mA g−1 current density, the capacity of the cell reduces to 202 mA h g−1 which could be regained at 389 mA h g−1 after the cell is cycled at 50 mA g−1. The decrease in the capacity with an increase in the cycle is primarily due to the mechanical stress, volume expansion and aggregation of the electrode material.
The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) of SnSe was recorded to obtain additional information on the electrochemical process (Fig. 9e). The EIS for the assembled cell was performed in the charged state and at room temperature. Nyquist plots as shown in Fig. 9f were obtained after the 1st and 70th cycle. A Nyquist plot in the middle frequency region appears as one depressed semicircle and in the low frequency region as an inclined line. These plots could be well evaluated by the equivalent circuit model shown in Fig. 9f. Table 4 shows the fitting parameters. R1 is the intersection point of the semicircle corresponding to the sum of all ohmic resistances from the electrode and the electrolyte. R2 is ascribed to the impedance towards Li-ion transport through the SEI layer. CPE is the constant phase element for the capacitance coupled with R2. It can be known from Fig. 9 that R1 increases with an increase in the cycle. This is attributed to the contribution of the decomposition of the electrode material. R1 is also found to be increased due to the dissolution of the electrode material into the electrolyte, thus increasing the resistance of the electrode. R3 arises due to charge transfer resistance. Both the resistance R2 and R3 increases upon cycling and as a result of these, the electrochemical performance deteriorates with time.47

A cycle performance test of SnSe was also carried out for 200 cycles at 200 mA g−1 current density. The study exhibits an initial specific capacity of 929 mA h g−1 which further stabilizes to 155 mA h g−1. The initial coulombic capacity was found to be ∼71% which stabilizes in the third cycle to ∼100% till 200 cycles (Fig. 9g).
For a better understanding of the electrode performance, a post mortem analysis was carried out using the pXRD, FT-IR, SEM and EDS techniques. From the pXRD analysis, not much information could be gathered because of the complexity arising from the use of multiple components while fabricating the electrode (super P carbon black, sodium alginate, EC, DMC etc.). However, a distinct reflection at around 32.3° can be associated with the (101) plane of elemental Sn and those at 45.3 and 46.2° can be associated with the (102) and (111) planes of elemental Se (ESI Fig. S9a†). Furthermore, the FT-IR analysis reveals a sharp peak at 1024.8 cm−1 and may be attributed to Sn–O stretching (1022 cm−1 in SnO2) whereas the sharp peak at 1212.4 cm−1 may be due to the red shift of the O–C–O stretch mode (1280.8 cm−1 in free DMC) due to an electrostatic interaction of Li+ with DMC (Li+⋯DMC) (ESI Fig. S9b†).48 The presence of an FT-IR peak due to the Sn–O bond may be from the SEI layer. The SEM analysis shows flocculents like morphology whereas the Sn:Se atom ratio derived from EDS analysis was found to be 1:1.18 which indicates that SnSe is still present (ESI Fig. S9c and d†). The pXRD and EDS analyses suggest that SnSe is partially dissociated in elemental Sn and Se during the course of the electrochemical reaction.
A full cell with the SnSe material was also fabricated to explore the feasibility of the electrode. A full cell was assembled in the CR2016 type coin cell using LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 as the cathode and SnSe as the anode and was cycled for 50 cycles at 100 mA g−1 current density. Initially, ∼70% coulombic efficiency with a normalised capacity of 104 mA h g−1 was obtained. It further improved to ∼100% from the 5th cycle with the specific capacity stabilized to 70 mA h g−1 (ESI Fig. S10†).
Conclusion
A new diorganotin complex [Me2Sn{2-SeC5H2(Me-4,6)2N}2] (1) was synthesized from a new diselenide bis(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)diselenide and was thoroughly characterized. A facile synthesis of phase pure orthorhombic SnSe 2D nanosheets through both the solvent-free (pyrolysis) and solvent-assisted (thermolysis) pathways has been demonstrated by utilizing the title complex as an SSP. Detailed characterization of the nanosheets reveals that the average crystallite size, morphology and optical band gap are dependent on the reaction conditions. It was demonstrated that the preferential orientation of nanosheets can be manipulated by the choice of the solvent. The optical band gap (direct and indirect) as deduced from the DRS ranges from 1.34 to 1.78 eV which was theoretically in the optimal range for an anode material for use in LIBs. The synthesised material shows a potential application in solving the agglomeration problem. Therefore, it exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance and good cycling stability. A high specific capacity of 389 and 202 mA h g−1 at 50 and 100 mA g−1, respectively, after 70 cycles along with 100% coulombic efficiency makes SnSe an attractive future anode material for LIBs.
