    , Accepted 24th October 2021First published on 25th October 2021AbstractAlthough niobium oxynitrides such as BaNbO2N possess desirable properties for solar energy conversion (e.g., narrower band gaps compared to their tantalum counterparts), their photoelectrode performance is generally inferior, probably because of the excessively high donor density derived from the reduced species (e.g., Nb4+) generated during their synthesis via nitridation with NH3. In this study, a series of BaNbO2N particles doped with various cations were synthesized to improve the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance of porous BaNbO2N photoanodes via donor density control in the semiconductor bulk. Doping lower-valent cations (Ti4+, Zr4+) into Nb5+ sites decreased the donor density, as indicated by the Mott–Schottky plots, and also suppressed the generation of Nb4+ species to some extent. In contrast, doping with higher-valent cations (W6+, Mo6+) increased the donor density and accelerated Nb4+ generation. The porous photoanodes of BaNbO2N doped with lower-valent cations showed a larger photocurrent density than that of the undoped photoanodes, whereas those fabricated with higher-valent cations exhibited smaller values over the entire applied potential range. The optimized Ti4+-doped BaNbO2N photoanodes exhibited superior performance compared to their tantalum counterparts, demonstrating PEC water splitting with a relatively high quantum efficiency under visible light after appropriate loading of a cocatalyst. These results strongly suggest that the donor density of undoped BaNbO2N was excessively high because of the inevitable reduction of Nb5+ during the nitridation process, and the appropriate reduction of donor density by lower-valent cation doping can provide both a suitable electron conductivity and a sufficient hole diffusion length, thus substantially improving the performance.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using semiconductor photoelectrodes, as well as photocatalytic water splitting using particulate semiconductors, has attracted considerable attention because of its potential for the clean production of hydrogen from water by utilizing abundant solar energy. Because the visible region possesses nearly half of the available solar energy incident on the Earth's surface, it is essential to develop photoelectrodes that can harvest a wide range of visible light to achieve highly efficient conversion of solar energy to hydrogen.1–4
A series of oxynitrides, including TaON,5–7 LaTiO2N,8,9 and BaTaO2N,10,11 are promising candidates for photoabsorbers for such photoelectrodes because many of them possess narrow band gaps for visible light absorption as well as appropriate band levels capable of both water oxidation and reduction. This is primarily because of the elevated valence band maxima (VBM) constructed from N 2p orbitals partially mixed with O 2p orbitals. We have previously demonstrated the stabilization (i.e., suppression of self-oxidative deactivation) of tantalum oxynitrides (e.g., TaON, BaTaO2N) via surface modification with a suitable water oxidation cocatalyst (e.g., IrOx, CoOx), as well as efficient PEC water splitting by using their photoanodes.12–16
Niobium oxynitrides, such as ANbO2N (A = Sr, Ba), are another more attractive series of candidates17–26 because they generally have narrower band gaps than their tantalum counterparts.27,28 In addition, Nb (24 ppm) is more abundant than Ta (2 ppm) in the Earth's crust.29 Despite these fascinating features, the application of niobium oxynitrides to photoelectrodes has an intrinsic problem, that is, the valence flexibility of Nb cations. During conventional nitridation synthesis using an NH3 stream at high temperatures, Nb5+ cations are readily reduced to a lower valence state (e.g., Nb4+).17,27 The facile generation of reduced species leads to an excessive donor density in the bulk, shortening the diffusion length of photogenerated holes and thus lowering the PEC efficiency. In our previous study, a SrNbO2N photoanode17 showed a relatively low incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for water oxidation (∼0.2% at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under 400 nm) compared to other porous oxynitride photoanodes such as BaTaO2N (∼20% under similar conditions),14 thus leaving considerable room for improvement in the PEC performance.
In this work, we attempted to change the carrier density in the bulk of the BaNbO2N semiconductor by doping tetra or hexavalent cations (Ti4+, Zr4+, Mo6+, and W6+) into Nb5+ sites and fabricated porous photoanodes with these cation-doped samples to improve the efficiency of PEC water splitting under visible light. Although cation-doping has been extensively studied as an effective method for the precise control of the carrier density of oxide semiconductors (e.g., BiVO4 in photoelectrodes for water splitting30–40), studies on the doping of oxynitride semiconductors are still limited.41
Experimental section
Sample preparation
Particulate samples of cation-doped BaNbO2N were prepared via thermal treatment of the corresponding oxide precursors with gaseous ammonia.17,27 For the cation-doped BaNbO2N, the corresponding oxide precursors (i.e., a mixture of partially crystalized Ba5Nb4O15 and BaNb2O6, possibly along with an undetected amorphous phase) were prepared by the polymerized complex method using the following metal sources: NbCl5 (99.9%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd), BaCO3 (99.99%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd), Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4 (95.0%, Nacalai Tesque), ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O (98.0%, Nacalai Tesque), (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (99.0%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd), and (NH4)10W12O41·5H2O (85.0%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd). These metal sources were dissolved in methanol (19 mL, 99.8%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd) at a ratio of Ba:Nb:M = 100:100 − x:x, in which the x values ranged from 1 to 5 with a fixed amount of Ba (8 mmol). Anhydrous citric acid (127 mmol, 98.0%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd) was immediately added to the solution to stabilize the metal cation species. The mixture was stirred with a magnetic hot stirrer at 423 K giving a transparent solution. After addition of ethylene glycol (46 mL, 99.5%, Nacalai Tesque), the solution was heated to 593 K on a hot stirrer for approximately 1 h for further promoting polymerization. The polymerized gel was pyrolyzed in a mantle heater at 623 K for approximately 2 h producing a black solid residue, which was then calcined in air at 873 K for 2 h. After natural cooling and intermediate grinding, the obtained powder was calcined in air at 1073 K for 2 h in an electric furnace. Each obtained oxide precursor was placed on a quartz boat located in a tube furnace. After removal of air by a flow of Ar gas (99.999%, 100 mL min−1) for more than 15 min, the oxide precursor was heated under a stream of NH3 (99.9995%, 100 mL min−1) at 1123 K for 15 h. The obtained samples are denoted as BNON:M-x (M = Ti, Zr, Mo, or W, x = 1–5). Undoped BaNbO2N samples (denoted as BNON) were prepared in a similar manner at the stoichiometric ratio (Ba:Nb = 1:1) for comparison.
SEM images of the cation-doped BaNbO2N samples revealed that their particle sizes were almost unchanged from that of the original undoped sample (see Fig. S1†). In addition, the specific surface areas of the cation-doped BaNbO2N samples (9.3 m2 g−1 for BNON:Ti-3, 8.3 m2 g−1 for BNON:W-3, 7.3 m2 g−1 for BNON:Mo-1) were not significantly different from those of the BNON sample (8.3 m2 g−1), although BNON:Zr-3 possessed a slightly larger specific surface area (11.9 m2 g−1) compared to those of the other samples.
As-prepared BNON:M-x particles were deposited on a Ti metal sheet using the electrophoretic deposition method detailed in our previous reports.12–14,16,17 A Ti metal sheet (1.5 × 6 cm2, 0.5 mm thick) was sonicated in acetone (99.5%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd) and then in 2-propanol (99.7%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd) for 10 min each. Electrophoretic deposition was performed in an acetone dispersion (50 mL) containing the prepared BNON:M-x particles (40 mg) and iodine (I2, 10 mg, 99.9%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd). The Ti metal sheet and a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate (Asahi Glass Co., Ltd) were immersed in the dispersion in parallel with an 8 mm distance, and subsequently a 25 V bias was applied using a conventional potentiostat. The coated area was fixed at 1.5 × 4 cm2 by adjusting the depth of immersion. The deposition time was set such that the number of particles and the resulting average thickness of the film were ∼2.5 mg and ∼2 µm, respectively, as optimized in our previous study17 (see Fig. S2† for a cross-sectional SEM image of a representative BNON electrode). To provide sufficient conductivity between the interparticle and BNON–FTO interface, a post-necking process was applied.12–14,16,17 The NbCl5 methanol solution (50 µL, 10 mM) was dropped on the BNON:M-x/Ti electrode, which was left in an ambient air atmosphere at room temperature for more than 10 min to produce amorphous Nb2O5 species via spontaneous hydrolysis by atmospheric moisture. After this process was repeated five times, the electrode was heated at 823 K for 30 min under an NH3 flow (10 mL min−1) to nitride the amorphous Nb2O5 species. According to the needs, a cobalt oxide (CoOy) cocatalyst was loaded onto the as-prepared BNON:M-x/Ti electrode to improve both stability and efficiency.13 An aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2 (98.0%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd) was dropped on the BNON:M-x/Ti electrode after the post-necking process to ensure that the loading of Co species was ∼8 wt% (on the basis of Co metal for simplification) relative to the quantity of BNON:M-x particles on each Ti substrate. Then, the electrode was dried in air and finally heated at 723 K for 30 min under an NH3 flow (10 mL min−1). The as-prepared photoanode is denoted as CoOy/BNON:M-x/Ti.
Characterization
The prepared samples were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; MiniFlex II, Rigaku, Cu Kα), UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (V-650, JASCO), scanning electron microscopy (SEM; NVision 40, Carl Zeiss-SIINT), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; ULVAC-PHI 5500MT, Mg Kα). The binding energies determined from the XPS measurements were referenced to the C 1s level (284.8 eV) of the residual carbon. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were measured using a BELSORP-mini II (MicrotracBEL) apparatus at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (77 K).
The Mott–Schottky plots were measured using a potentiostat (PARSTAT2263, Princeton Applied Research) with a three-electrode system consisting of BNON:M-x loaded FTO (coated area: 1.5 × 1.5 cm2) as a working electrode, a Pt counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode in an aqueous sodium phosphate buffer solution (pH 8). The phosphate buffer was prepared by mixing 0.1 M Na2HPO4 (aq.) (99.0%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd) and 0.1 M NaH2PO4 (aq.) (99.0%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd). The electrodes that did not undergo the post-necking process were used for the Mott–Schottky measurements to eliminate the influence of necking species. The AC amplitude and frequency were 10 mV and 500 Hz, respectively.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted using a potentiostat (VersaSTAT 4, Princeton Applied Research) with a three-electrode system consisting of the prepared photoelectrode, a counter electrode (Pt coil), a Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.1 M, pH 6, 99.0%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd) as the electrolyte. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 0.1 M, 30.0–35.5%, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd) was added to the solution as a hole scavenger.33 In some cases, a phosphate buffer solution (pH 8) was employed. Dissolved air in the solution was removed by purging with Ar gas (100 mL min−1) for at least 20 min prior to measurement. Visible light (400 < λ < 800 nm) was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (LX-300F, Cermax) combined with a cold mirror (CM-1) and a cut-off filter (L-42, Hoya) to the photoelectrodes (the irradiated area was fixed at 6 cm2 (1.5 × 4 cm2)).
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was evaluated by irradiating monochromatic light (irradiated area was 1 × 1 cm2) using a Xe lamp (MAX-302, Asahi Spectra Co. Ltd) equipped with bandpass filters (full width at half maximum: 10 nm). The photon flux, which was measured with a Si photodiode power meter (9742, Hioki E. E. Co.), was adjusted at approximately 1.2 mW cm−2 using a neutral density filter. The IPCE value was calculated using eqn (1): IPCE [%] = 1240 × photocurrent density [mA cm−2] × 100/(wavelength [nm] × photon flux [mW cm−2])(1)
For water splitting reaction, a two-electrode system consisting of the CoOy/BNON:Ti-4/Ti photoanode and a counter electrode (Pt wire), which were placed at a distance of 1 cm, was employed in an aqueous sodium phosphate buffer solution (100 mL, pH 8). The temperature of the electrochemical cell was maintained at 288 K by a water bath during the experiment. Before the reactions, Ar gas was pumped into the reaction cell (100 mL min−1) for at least 30 min to replace the residual air. The evolved H2 and O2 gases were analyzed with a gas chromatograph (INFICON 3000) combined with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and MS-5A column with an Ar carrier, which is directly connected to the photoelectrochemical cell.
Results and discussion
Characterization of cation-doped BaNbO2N

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of BNON:Zr-3, BNON:Ti-3, BNON:W-3, BNON:Mo-1 and pristine BNON samples, in which KCl powder was used as an internal standard for the correction of the 2θ angles. Note that the amount of Mo6+ introduced was set to 1% unless otherwise stated because further addition of Mo6+ produced impurity phases (see Fig. S3†). All the diffraction peaks of the samples shown in Fig. 1 can be assigned to those of the perovskite phase BaNbO2N (ICDD No. 01-084-1749) without any peaks derived from impurities. As seen in the magnified patterns, the introduction of Ti, W, and Mo species resulted in a slight but noticeable shift of the main (110) diffraction peaks (at approximately 30.6° in the pristine sample) toward higher angles, while the introduction of Zr species resulted in a shift toward lower angles. Given the ionic radius of each cation with the intended valence in octahedral coordination (Zr4+: 72 pm, Ti4+: 60.5 pm, W6+: 60 pm, Mo6+: 59 pm, and parent Nb5+: 64 pm),43 the observed shifts in all the samples can be explained by the doping of these cations with the intended valences in place of Nb5+. XP spectra of doped BaNbO2N samples clearly exhibited signals assignable to the doped metals (Fig. S4, Table S1†), also supporting the successful doping at least in the XPS detectable surface region. However, the XP spectrum of BNON:W-3 in the W 4f region (see Fig. S4†) was broader than that of conventional WO3, strongly suggesting the coexistence of reduced species (e.g., W5+ and W4+). The BNON:Mo-1 sample also exhibited a broad peak centered at approximately 232 eV, which is close to the typical value for Mo6+ species, suggesting the introduction of Mo6+ along with some reduced Mo species (e.g., Mo5+). However, precise analysis was difficult owing to the low intensity of the XP spectrum for BNON:Mo-1 with lower (1 mol%) doping than that of the other samples (3 mol%). Note that the XPS results only reflect the chemical states of cations near the surface and thus cannot ensure their state in the bulk. Regardless, the shifts in the diffraction peaks (Fig. 1) support the successful doping of each cation into Nb5+ sites, while the production of some unintentional species (e.g., W5+) was confirmed by XPS analysis.

Fig. 2 shows the diffuse reflectance spectra of the doped (BNON:Zr-3, BNON:Ti-3, BNON:W-3, BNON:Mo-1) and undoped (BNON) BaNbO2N samples. Although all the samples exhibited similar absorption edges at approximately 720 nm, doping provided a significant change in the absorption at longer wavelengths. Such background absorption at wavelengths longer than the band gap is generally attributed to light absorption by free electrons in the conduction band and/or excitation of electrons trapped in defect sites (e.g., anion defects) to the conduction band.27,44–46 Although both the defects existing at the surface and in the bulk should work as trapping sites47,48 and thereby affect the performance of photoelectrodes, we have no effective means for quantifying them distinctly at this stage. Importantly, doping with lower-valent cations (Ti4+, Zr4+) decreased the absorption compared to that of the pristine sample, whereas doping with higher-valent cations (W6+, Mo6+) increased the absorption. The observed change in background absorption suggests that cation doping successfully altered the donor density, as intended; that is, lower-valent cations decreased the donor density, and higher-valent cations increased the donor density.

However, the production of reduced species of parent Nb5+ should be taken into account. This is in contrast to the previous case of cation doping in BaTaO2N, in which the parent Ta5+ is essentially stable under reductive atmospheres (e.g., NH3).41 The sizable background absorption even for the undoped BaNbO2N implies that a considerable quantity of reduced species (e.g., Nb4+) formed during nitridation with NH3. Fig. 3 shows the XP spectra of the powder samples in the Nb 3d region. Although the spectrum of pristine BaNbO2N (BNON) was fairly broad, two primary peaks can be identified at approximately 206.7 and 209.5 eV, which are derived from Nb5+.49–52 The spectra of the other samples were also broadened toward lower binding energies, indicating the presence of reduced species such as Nb4+. Assuming that the Nb4+ species in BNON exhibited a peak at 205.5 eV similar to those in NbO2,51–53 peak deconvolution was conducted for each sample to estimate the ratio of Nb4+ to Nb5+. The Nb4+/Nb5+ values increased considerably from that in BNON (0.94) after the introduction of higher-valent cations (1.20 and 1.05 for BNON:W-3 and BNON:Mo-1, respectively), whereas they decreased after the addition of lower-valent cations (0.63 and 0.89 for BNON:Zr-3 and BNON:Ti-3, respectively). This phenomenon is probably due to charge compensation from the cations introduced into the Nb5+ sites. The decrease in positive charge due to the generation of Nb4+ from Nb5+ during nitridation must be compensated by a decrease in the negative charge, that is, the formation of anion defects. A close look at the difference in Nb4+/Nb5+ ratio (0.63 for BNON:Zr-3, 0.89 for BNON:Ti-3) may shed light on the different stability of these cations (Zr4+, Ti4+) during nitridation. It has been reported that the oxidation state of Zr4+ contents in metal oxide and oxynitride is relatively stable54,55 while Ti4+ in TiO2-related materials is reported to undergo partial reduction to Ti3+ at 773 K.56 Although the degree of reduction could not be precisely compared for the present doped-BNON samples due to overlapping of the peaks of Zr 3d and Ba 4p in XPS (Fig. S4†), a more stable valence state of Zr4+ might led to the effective suppression of Nb4+ formation in BNON. Assuming that the permissible quantity of anion defects is approximately fixed, the introduction of lower-valent cations should suppress Nb4+ formation, whereas the introduction of higher-valent cations should accelerate Nb4+ generation.

It should be noted here again that the results of the surface-sensitive XPS analysis cannot guarantee the bulk properties. Therefore, the change in carrier density due to cation doping was evaluated by Mott–Schottky analysis. Fig. 4 shows the Mott–Schottky plots of the BNON:Zr-3, BNON:Ti-3, BNON:W-3, BNON:Mo-1, and BNON electrodes in an aqueous phosphate buffer solution adjusted to pH 8. The relationship between the donor density and flat band potential (Vfb) is expressed by eqn (2): 1/C2 = 2(V − Vfb)/eε0εrND(2)where C, V, Vfb, e, ε0, εr, and ND denote the electrostatic capacity (F m−2), applied potential (V), flat band potential (V), elementary charge (C), permittivity of vacuum (F m−1), relative permittivity, and donor density (m−3), respectively. Although specific values of the donor densities can be calculated based on the formula, no reliable εr value for BaNbO2N semiconductors has been reported as far as the authors know. Thus, the variation in the donor densities will be discussed using the slope of the Mott–Schottky plots.33 Because e, ε0, and εr are constant, a higher slope (2/eε0εrND) corresponds to a lower ND. Note that their flat band potentials (−0.27 to −0.29 V vs. RHE) were slightly affected by cation doping. As seen in Fig. 4, doping with lower-valent cations (Ti4+, Zr4+) increased the slope compared to that of the undoped sample, indicating a decrease in donor density. In contrast, doping with higher-valent cations (W6+, Mo6+) resulted in a lower slope, that is, an increased donor density. The variation in the donor density of BaNbO2N with cation doping is essentially consistent with that observed for cation-doped BaTaO2N in our previous report.41 Although the change in the quantity of reduced species (e.g., Nb4+) should be considered, these results prove that the donor density of BaNbO2N semiconductors can be controlled by cation doping.

Photoelectrochemical properties of cation-doped BaNbO2N

Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent generated on the cation-doped BaNbO2N photoanodes in an aqueous Na2SO4 solution (0.1 M) containing hydrogen peroxide (0.1 M) under a potential sweep (50 mV s−1) and intermittent visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). Hydrogen peroxide was used as an effective and efficient hole scavenger to minimize the influence of photocurrent generation via the self-oxidation of nitrogen anions (N3−) near the surface by holes.18,35,36,42 The BNON:Ti-3 and BNON:Zr-3 photoanodes showed a larger photocurrent density than that of undoped BNON, while BNON:W-3 and BNON:Mo-1 exhibited smaller values over the entire range of applied potentials. For Ti4+ doping, further doping of up to 4 mol% was possible (see Fig. S5a†) without impurity formation, which provided a further decrease in the Nb4+/Nb5+ ratio as determined by XPS (see Fig. S5b†). The BNON:Ti-4 sample exhibited continuous photocurrent for at least 2 h (Fig. S6†) with good reproducibility. The photocurrent densities at a fixed potential of 1.02 V vs. RHE are summarized in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 5  Dependence of photocurrent on applied potential in an aqueous Na2SO4 solution (0.1 M, pH 6) containing H2O2 (0.1 M) under intermittent visible light irradiation for BNON, BNON:Zr-3, BNON:Ti-x (x = 3, 4), BNON:W-3, and BNON:Mo-1 electrodes. 
 Fig. 6  Photocurrent density of cation-doped BaNbO2N and BaTaO2N electrodes in an aqueous Na2SO4 solution (0.1 M, pH 6) in the presence of H2O2 (0.1 M) under visible light (λ > 400 nm). 
The performance of the cation-doped BaTaO2N photoanode41 was evaluated again under the same conditions, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 for comparison. Note that the performance of the present BaTaO2N electrodes was confirmed to be comparable to those in the previous study.41 Importantly, the Nb and Ta systems exhibited opposite trends; doping with lower-valent cations improved the performance of the BaNbO2N photoanodes, whereas doping with higher-valent cations was favorable for the Ta counterparts. These opposing trends can be reasonably explained by the difference in the donor densities of the pristine (i.e., undoped) materials. In the case of BaTaO2N (in which the parent species Ta5+ is relatively stable under reductive atmospheres), the donor density is insufficient to afford efficient conductivity of photoexcited electrons through the network of BaTaO2N particles in the porous photoanode. Therefore, increasing the donor density via doping with higher-valent cations (e.g., Mo6+)41 or the reduction of Ta5+ under a H2 atmosphere at high temperatures14 facilitates electron transport, thereby improving the performance of BaTaO2N photoanodes. In contrast, the donor density of pristine BaNbO2N is excessively high because of the presence of reduced species (e.g., Nb4+) that are generated during nitridation under an NH3 atmosphere, which shortens the diffusion distance of photogenerated holes through recombination. Thus, doping with lower-valent cations (such as Ti4+ and Zr4+) can appropriately reduce the donor density to simultaneously afford sufficient conductivity of the majority carriers (electrons) and a sufficient diffusion length of the minority carriers (holes) toward surfaces to react with substances (e.g., H2O or H2O2). Another important aspect is the higher photocurrent density obtained on the optimized BaNbO2N photoanode (i.e., doped with 4 mol% Ti4+) than that of the optimized Ta counterpart, indicating the great potential of Nb-based oxynitrides as photoanode materials for PEC water splitting by harvesting a wider range of visible light.
PEC water splitting was then attempted using the BNON:Ti-4 photoanode (which showed the highest photocurrent density (Fig. S7†)) coupled with a Pt counter electrode for H2 generation. A cobalt oxide (CoOy)-based cocatalyst was chosen to catalyze water oxidation and thereby improve the stability of the photoanode, following our previous reports on TaON and BaTaO2N photoanodes.13,14 To avoid changes in the donor density of BNON:Ti-4 during the heat treatment used to load the cocatalyst, a Co(NO3)2 solution was dropped on the electrode after the necking process, which was then heated in an NH3 flow at a relatively low temperature (723 K). Fig. 7a shows the photocurrent generated on the BNON:Ti-4 photoanodes with and without CoOy loading in an aqueous phosphate buffer solution (pH 8) under intermittent visible light irradiation. Note that no hole scavenger (e.g., H2O2) was added to the solution to evaluate the water oxidation performance. The CoOy-loaded BNON:Ti-4 electrode (denoted as CoOy/BNON:Ti-4) exhibited a higher photocurrent density than that of the unmodified BNON:Ti-4 electrode, indicating that the CoOy cocatalyst effectively facilitated water oxidation. As shown in Fig. S8,† the onset wavelength in the IPCE spectra of the CoOy/BNON:Ti-4 photoanode agreed well with the absorption edge of BNON:Ti-4. This indicates that the photocurrent was derived from the band-gap excitation of BaNbO2N. The effective catalysis of CoOy was also confirmed by the results under a potentiostatic condition (1.2 V vs. RHE, Fig. 7b). The photocurrent over the unmodified BNON:Ti-4 electrode immediately decreased and became negligibly low within 5 min, undoubtedly due to self-deactivation through the oxidation of nitrogen anions (N3−) into N2 by photogenerated holes, as previously reported for TaON and BaTaO2N photoanodes.13,14 Indeed, the N/Nb atomic ratio determined from XPS analysis appreciably decreased from 1 (the N/Nb before the measurement was normalized to unity) to 0.5 after photoirradiation for 1 h. CoOy loading effectively suppressed the decrease in N/Nb (from 1 to 0.9), indicating that the CoOy loaded on BNON:Ti-4 enhanced the consumption of photogenerated holes by catalyzing water, thereby suppressing self-oxidative deactivation. Importantly, the CoOy/BNON:Ti-4 photoanode exhibited a considerably higher photocurrent than that of the undoped CoOy/BNON photoanode, clearly demonstrating the efficacy of cation doping (specifically with lower-valent cations) to improve the performance of Nb-based oxynitride photoanodes (Scheme 1).

Fig. 8 shows the variation in H2 and O2 evolution over time for the CoOy/BNON:Ti-4 photoanode under visible light irradiation with an applied bias of 1.2 V vs. the Pt counter electrode (without a reference electrode). H2 and O2 evolved in an almost stoichiometric ratio (H2/O2 = 2.1). The amounts of gases evolved in 120 min (H2: 18.8 µmol, O2: 8.8 µmol) exceeded the molar amounts of BNON:Ti-4 (9.1 µmol) and CoOy (2.7 µmol, calculated as CoO), respectively, indicating that PEC water splitting occurred. The amount of evolved H2 was in good agreement with half of the electrons passing through the outer circuit (e−/2, indicated by the broken line), and the faradaic efficiency for O2 evolution was estimated to be approximately 91%. In summary, PEC water splitting under visible light was demonstrated in a two-electrode configuration using the BNON:Ti-4 photoanode with the aid of a cocatalyst.

Conclusions
In this work, we demonstrated a significant improvement in the PEC performance of perovskite-type niobium oxynitrides (BaNbO2N) for water oxidation by controlling their carrier densities via cation doping. The key to enhancing the PEC performance was to decrease the carrier density by the introduction of lower-valent Ti4+ or Zr4+ into Nb5+ sites in Nb-based (oxy)nitrides, which is distinct from their Ta counterparts. Because the donor density of the undoped BaNbO2N was excessively high because of the inevitable reduction of Nb5+ during the nitridation process, doping with lower-valent cations was an effective way to achieve an appropriate donor density in the BaNbO2N bulk that simultaneously provided both a suitable electron conductivity within the porous photoanode and a sufficient hole diffusion length. The findings of the present study offer useful insights into the fabrication of highly efficient photoanodes made from Nb-based oxynitrides, which suffer from the inevitable reduction of Nb5+ during their synthesis, and the possibility of highly efficient water splitting under solar light based on Nb-based oxynitride photoanodes that can harvest a wide range of visible light.
