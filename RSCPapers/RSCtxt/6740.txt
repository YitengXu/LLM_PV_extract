    , Accepted 3rd June 2020First published on 3rd June 2020AbstractPerovskite materials have demonstrated remarkable optoelectronic properties, which have placed them at the crux of the photovoltaic technology. In this era of striving for clean and economical methods of energy production, lead-based perovskites have become the key materials in photovoltaics owing to their facile solution processability and phenomenal performance. Unfortunately, lead toxicity poses a major hurdle to their scalability and widespread commercialization. Hence, to fulfill the indisputable need for energy, lead-free perovskites are considered to be a boon to the future of photovoltaic technology. In this perspective, we provide a comprehensive assessment of lead-free perovskite solar cells enabled by hetero-valent substitutes. These comprise A3B2X9-structured perovskites, halide double perovskites, and mixed metal halide–chalcogenide perovskites. Importantly, we emphasize the effects of cationic–anionic sites, metal substitutions, and solvents on the chemical and structural properties of A3B2X9-structured perovskites. Moreover, we also focus on antimony(V) perovskite-like materials and antimony-based perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) in the fabrication of devices. Two types of halide double perovskites are described, including A2B(I)B(III)X6 and A2B(IV)X6 double perovskites. Subsequently, chalcogenide perovskite solar cells are also discussed. Overall, the primary purpose of this perspective is to explicitly describe lead-free perovskite solar cells enabled by hetero-valent substitutions more broadly as a category of next-generation optoelectronic materials. Finally, we propose that mixed halide–chalcogenide perovskites offer a promising pathway towards achieving highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
Over the past decade, inorganic–organic hybrid perovskites (IOHPs) have captivated much research interest and emerged as potential candidates in the field of photovoltaics. Ever since their inception by the Miyasaka group in 2009, IOHPs have become a cult in the perovskite family because of their phenomenal magnetic, electronic and optical properties.1 Their galvanizing properties such as tuneable direct bandgaps,2 high extinction coefficients,3 high charge carrier mobilities,4,5 long charge-carrier diffusion lengths,6–9 low Urbach energies,3,10 low Wannier–Mott exciton binding energies,11 small Stokes shifts,6 and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs)12,13 place the whole new family of halide perovskites at the frontline of optoelectronic and electronic devices.2,14–17 Amongst the various IOHPs, lead-halide-based perovskites (LHPs) are the most well-studied structures in various optoelectronic devices.18,19 Having a high light absorption capability, LHPs have particularly high absorption coefficients in the red region, ca. 25 times more than those of silicon and GaAs materials.14,20,21
1.1. Challenges for lead-based perovskites
Recent efforts on the simultaneous optimization of perovskite layers, interfacial engineering, and device architectures have skyrocketed power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) to ∼25.2% nearing the Shockley–Queisser limit of 31.4%.22 In spite of massive progress leading to high PCEs and PLQYs, IOHPs still suffer from three major challenges that circumscribe the pace of commercialization. These challenges include (i) substantial performance degradation owing to high susceptibility to oxygen and moisture;23–28 (ii) issues with structural stability on account of conceivable crystallization into undesirable phases, for example, the photoinactive hexagonal δ-phase;29,30 (iii) the toxic nature of lead causing serious implications on health.31–33 In particular, Li et al. found that lead halide perovskite is more dangerous than other lead pollutants from a series of data on the environmental impact using plants.34 Albeit there has been significant progress achieved in tackling the stability issues, obtaining efficient, non-toxic, and lead-free perovskites has become the next indispensable task.35 There are two typical methodologies to diminish the usage of lead in perovskites and acquire a low-toxic metal halide perovskite. One is the fractional substitution of lead with non-hazardous metal cations.36–42 The other is the complete substitution of lead with a specific cation, such as Sn(II), Ge(II), Mn(II), Cu(II), Bi(III), or Sb(III).43–47
1.2. What makes elements with an ns2 electronic configuration so useful?
According to first-principles calculations, the outermost s electrons in the lead with a 6s2 electronic configuration endow the lead-based perovskites with exceptional performance.48–50 In perovskites with ns2 configured elements, the s-state of the cation decreases in energy and separates from the p-state, thereby establishing a lone pair state. Anomalously, considerable charge transfer occurs from the cation p-state to the anion p-state. Therefore, the s-orbital of the cation can hybridize with the p-orbitals of the anion in accord with the antibonding feature of the valence band maximum (VBM) and reduce the ionization energy. Similarly, the conduction band attains antibonding character due to the hybridization of spatially extended p-states of both the cation and anion. Since these post-transition elements are heavy, the conduction band minimum (CBM) moves downward due to the considerable spin–orbit coupling. This prompts the band offsets to disperse simultaneously.51 Hence, defect states with high formation energies (Eform) are established either inside or near the band edge and prevent the formation of deep-level traps, thereby favoring high carrier mobility. This cross-bandgap hybridization achieves Born effective charges practically equivalent to typical ferroelectric materials. Moreover, it increases the dielectric constant responsible for longer diffusion length and carrier lifetime and higher μτ values (here, μ and τ are carrier mobility and lifetime), favoring charge carrier transport by considerably screening the formation of charged defects.52,53
1.3. Why use a heterovalent substitute?
To obtain a lead-free perovskite, tin (Sn2+) was first substituted because of its similar electronic configuration and approximately equal effective ionic radius (Table 1).54–56 Thus, lead-free Sn-based perovskite solar cells were fabricated by many research groups.57–61 However, the rapid oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ under ambient conditions circumscribe tin-based perovskites from becoming a more significant alternative. Moreover, the degradation of tin perovskites can result in SnI2, which is as hazardous as PbI2.62 Germanium (Ge2+) was also considered as a divalent lead alternative, but very low PCEs were due to the wide-bandgaps from the quasi-3D hexagonal structure in Ge-based perovskites.63 Additionally, the smaller ionic radius of Ge2+ (Table 1) and low precursor solubility in polar solvents might also contribute to the low PCE.64 Furthermore, Ge4+ is more stable than Ge2+, which causes instability in the perovskite structure. Although copper (Cu2+) in its stable oxidation state can substitute for lead, because of its smaller ionic radius (Table 1) the corner-sharing network of halide octahedrons becomes constrained. This results in low absorption coefficients, low intrinsic conductivity, and high effective hole masses in the perovskite layer.64,65 To determine an adequate homovalent ion replacement for Pb2+, recent computational studies were performed with all permutations and combinations of potential metal halide perovskites.66,67 According to these investigations, it was proposed that no other divalent metal cation can show the equivalent anomalous optoelectronic properties of lead and tin-based perovskites.

Therefore, the only acceptable option left is to substitute lead with a heterovalent cation.68 It would be wise to find other heterovalent elements possessing s outer lone pair electrons, similar to the Pb2+ cation electronic configuration.
1.4. Why use mixed chalcogenides and halides?
The heterovalent replacements must obey charge neutrality by altering the structure of the crystal. There are several ways to achieve heterovalent substitutions. The first is to replace divalent Pb2+ with trivalent cations (e.g., Sb3+, Bi3+) with an accompanying structure change from ABX3 to A3B2X9. However, these materials have 0D to 2D structures with strongly bound excitons with low mobilities. Another option is lead-free halide double perovskites with the general formula A2B(I)B(III)X6, where B(I) is a monovalent cation and B(III) is a trivalent cation, or AB(IV)X6, where the B site is occupied by a tetravalent cation and a vacancy. However, the efficiencies of A3B2X9 and double perovskite solar cells are still poor. Some researchers have also proposed chalcogenide perovskites; however, few solar cells based on these materials have been reported, and usually high temperatures are required for their preparation. Therefore, a synergistic combination of metal halide perovskite solar cells showing excellent efficiencies and metal chalcogenide solar cells, achieving quite high stability results in highly efficient and stable lead-free perovskite solar cells. Thus, we expect that mixed chalcogenides and halides might be a promising pathway.
From this perspective, we summarize perovskites with an A3B2X9 structure first. The effects of the cationic–anionic sites, metal substitutions, and solvents on the chemical and structural properties of A3B2X9-structured perovskites are discussed, and antimony(V)-based perovskite-like materials and nanocrystals (NCs) are also mentioned. Secondly, two types of halide double perovskites are described, including A2B(I)B(III)X6 and A2B(IV)X6 double perovskites. Finally, chalcogenide perovskites, and a few solar cells based on these materials are briefly reviewed. We then propose using mixed chalcogenides and halides to obtain high efficiency and stability in lead-free perovskite solar cells.
2. A3B2X9 structured perovskites
Recently, the incorporation of the trivalent cations of Sb and Bi has taken over the field of perovskite photovoltaics owing to their lead-like inactive outer shell s-orbital electrons. Bi3+ is iso-electronic to Pb2+ and adopts a similar valence shell electron lone pair 6s2 (Table 1) and has a nearly equivalent effective ionic radius to Pb2+ (Table 1). Unfortunately, bismuth halide perovskites display low performance due to their relatively large bandgaps compared to other IOHPs, which lead to low short circuit current densities. Even double perovskites of bismuth are indirect bandgap semiconductors with high exciton binding energies of nearly 200 meV.69 Due to these factors, the commercialization of bismuth-based perovskites is limited. Nevertheless, bismuth perovskites can still qualify as prominent photon absorbers in the perovskite family by tailoring their electronic structure.
The quest for an environmentally benign and suitable photo-absorber as a replacement to lead in IOHPs is a pressing priority. Antimony (Sb3+) has an electronic configuration analogous to that of lead (Pb2+) with inactive s electrons in the outermost shell. On the other hand, in pre-modern medicine, antimony was used in remedies such as emetics.70 Antimony compounds were also used as anti-protozoan drugs, skin conditioners, antischistosomal drugs, and various veterinary drugs.71–73 Therefore, antimony is considered to be a benign proxy to lead. Long ago, crystals of (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9 were synthesized by the slow evaporation method for medicine, but more recently materials with similar empirical formulae have gained enormous attention in the realm of materials science.74
Due to its stable (3+) oxidation state, antimony is not able to frame a corner-sharing 3D structure. Hence, the crystal structure of the antimony-based perovskite adopts low dimensionality with the unusual perovskite derived from A3Sb2X9, which can adopt a 2D layered (Pm1) or 0D dimer (P63/mmc) structure as shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively, where A is a monovalent cation and X is a monovalent anion.75,76 Thus, with one-third of metal deficiency, the A3Sb2X9 structure deviates slightly from the conventional metal halide perovskite structure, however, retains its photon harvesting capability. In general, the dimensionality of the perovskite governs carrier mobility, band dispersion, and effective mass of the charge carriers.77 Despite this fact, antimony-based perovskites are inclined to low dimensionality; they have charge carriers with low effective masses. Notably, like all other lead-free metal halide perovskites, antimony perovskites exhibit structure–property tuneability to enhance their photovoltaic performance. Its stable oxidation state, non-toxic nature, and high absorption coefficient make antimony an excellent choice for lead-free perovskites. Therefore, by altering parameters such as other elements in the lattice of the antimony perovskite structure and synthesis conditions, as well as interfacial engineering it is possible to fabricate stable, efficient, and non-hazardous devices.

2.1. Impact of the cation (A site) in antimony-based perovskites
A3Sb2X9 perovskites can adopt two geometries based on their composition and synthesis procedure: a corner-sharing octahedron layered structure (2D) and a face-sharing octahedron dimer structure (0D), as shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. In this section, we discuss the impact of the cation in governing the structure of A3Sb2X9 perovskites. Recent theoretical studies have established the fact that the corner-sharing octahedron layered (2D) structure is preferred compared to the face-sharing octahedron dimer (0D) structure in terms of the optimum direct bandgap, high carrier mobility, and tolerance to defects due to its higher dielectric constant.48,75 Since A3Sb2X9 cannot be easily solution-processed in the layered phase, a new solution-processable method to form layered perovskites needs to be explored and developed. More importantly, it was observed that the effective ionic radius of the cation will control the structure of the perovskite.78 Now the challenge is to synthesize a layered structure through strategically varying the monovalent cations in the A sites of the A3Sb2X9 perovskite structure. In the case of inorganic cations, density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the formation energies of the two forms of Cs3Sb2I9 differed by 0.1 eV, so the synthesis conditions will determine which form to be obtained.51,79,80 However, in the case of Rb3Sb2I9, because of the smaller size of Rb+ (Table 2), the formation energies of the layered and dimer forms of the perovskites differed by 0.25 eV favoring the layered structure, which gives an open-circuit voltage of 0.55 V and photocurrent density higher than 2 mA cm−2.51 Therefore, introducing cations with small ionic radii will facilitate the formation of the layered structure, as shown in Fig. 2c(y).

In the case of organic cations, MA+ is a bulky group in the hybrid organic–inorganic antimony perovskite (MA3Sb2X9), so it favors the formation of the face-sharing octahedron dimer structure (0D) as shown in Fig. 2c(x). In this structure, MA+ cations surround the (Sb2I9)3− octahedral metal halide unit. However, by varying the stoichiometries of the halides in mixed perovskites, it is feasible to achieve the layered structure.81 These comparisons demonstrate the effect of the monovalent cation on determining the structure and performance of A3Sb2I9 perovskites. Finally, because of the bulky structures of organic cations, compared to inorganic cations, in A3Sb2I9, these hybrid antimony perovskites can adopt a mostly 0D. For a perovskite crystal to adopt a well-stabilized structure, it must have an optimal tolerance factor. To obtain an optimal tolerance factor, the inclusion of smaller cations into the structure has been demonstrated to be effective.82–86 Therefore, fully inorganic perovskites are evolving into a class of halide perovskites with higher stability against moisture, oxygen, and temperature. Furthermore, the incorporation of cesium (Cs), rubidium (Rb), potassium (K), sodium (Na), and other small inorganic monovalent cations stabilize the perovskite layered structure,87–92 unlike bulky organic groups (methylammonium, formamidinium, ethylammonium, and guanidinium), resulting in better stabilities and performances.
Additionally, double and triple cation A3−x−yA′xA′′ySb2X9-based perovskites with different element combinations and stoichiometries have recently been explored.85,93–95 The most common cations that have been used for combination are Cs+, MA+, FA+, and Rb+. By varying the cation concentrations, the properties of the materials can be tuned. Therefore, there is a huge scope for new materials with different combinations in double and triple cation antimony-based perovskites to be explored.
2.2. Impact of the anion (X-site) in antimony-based perovskites
Halide ions are critical in maintaining charge neutrality between cations and anions, and they have been highly explored because of their suitable effective ionic radii. The bandgap tends to decrease with the electronegativity difference between accommodated anions and cations.96 Since the bandgap decreases linearly between Cl−, Br−, and I−, halides with less electronegative character essentially acquire the appropriate bandgap enabling them to absorb a major part of the solar spectrum. It is well reported that iodine plays a major role in regular octahedral structure formation, and it is worth mentioning that iodide perovskites are more sensitive to moisture.97 However, bromide (196 pm) and chloride (181 pm) hinder the formation of cubic perovskites because of their smaller ionic radii when compared to iodide (220 pm).98 Therefore, antimony mixed halide perovskites are deemed to be more productive compared to single halide antimony perovskites. Here, the incorporation of chlorine in (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9 has helped to achieve a layered structure (CH3NH3)3Sb2ClxI9−x rather than the unwanted 0D dimer phase.99 Moreover, halide-rich mixed halide perovskites are able to minimize photoinduced segregation.100–103 Hence, the goal is to synthesize a material with different concentrations of the halides in double and triple mixed halide perovskites that display optimum performance. In addition, pseudohalogens with similar chemical properties have the potential to be the elements in the next generation of lead-free antimony organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells.104 Pseudohalogens such as SCN−, SeCN−, OCN−, and CN− are possible substitutes for the X site of organic–inorganic perovskites.105,106 Therefore, systematic studies on the incorporation of mixed halides and pseudohalides in antimony perovskites are of great interest. Moreover, there is a need to investigate the possible combination of different monovalent anions of appropriate size and electronic configuration to achieve a stable layered perovskite.
2.3. Mixed metal antimony-based perovskites
The deliberate inclusion of specific ions into the crystal lattice has been chosen as a promising strategy to modulate the optoelectronic properties of antimony-based perovskites.107 The incorporation of a divalent cation (B2+) into the A3Sb2X9 perovskite structure results in achieving a layered phase A4BSb2X12 perovskite (Fig. 1c). This strategy allows us to tune the bandgap and imparts stability to antimony-halide perovskites. Initially, Cu2+ (Table 2) was introduced into α-Cs3Sb2Cl9 to achieve a mixed metal Cs4CuSb2Cl12 layered phase perovskite with a 1.0 eV direct bandgap along with high thermal stability, photostability, conductivity, and humidity resistance.108 To obtain new materials for better photovoltaic performance, it is necessary to stop using single metal halide perovskites. Metals such as Co2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ (Table 2), which can form mixed metal perovskites, need to be incorporated in variable quantities to observe the change in stability and optoelectronic properties of the material. Similarly, by strategic engineering of the material through partial substitution of antimony with appropriate trivalent cations we can obtain a A3(Sb2−x−yBxB′y)X9 (B and B′ = Bi3+, In3+, Ga3+, and Al3+) perovskite, and band gaps can be altered by varying the concentrations of the metals which occupy the B site.
Another class of materials that has attained considerable interest is double perovskites with the basic structural formulas A2BSbX6 (Fig. 1d) and A2M(IV)X6 (Fig. 1e) where A is a monovalent cation, X is a monovalent halide anion, and B is a monovalent metal cation. Generally, double perovskites are highly stable and environmentally friendly compared to typical perovskites.69 This will be discussed further in Section 2.
2.4. Influence of solvent in synthesis of antimony perovskites
Even after many developments in the field of perovskites, there are still many challenges which remain untouched, and some which have not had a substantial focus. Most critical among these are precursor–solvent interactions in the solution-mediated crystallization of perovskites.109,110 It has not been explicitly explained how solvent choice governs the formation of intermediates. In any synthesis process, precursor–solvent interactions play a major role in obtaining the desired products.111–113 Generally, the dielectric constant,111,113 Hansen's solubility parameters,114 Mayer bond unsaturation,115 and Gutmann's donor number116 are used to depict the interactions between a solvent and a precursor. Among these, Gutmann's donor number (DN), dealing with the Lewis basicity of the solvent, is of vital importance when determining the interactions between the precursor and solvent. Solvents with low DN coordinate weakly with Sb2+ and allow the formation of the halide–antimony complex. On the other hand, solvents with high DN will compete with X− to coordinate with Sb2+ and suppress the formation of the halide–antimony complex. Solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl propylene urea (DMPU), N-methyl-2pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylacetamide (DMAC), and dimethylformamide (DMF) have high DN due to their high basicity. These solvents promote the formation of stable precursor solutions favoring thin film formation. Other solvents with low DN such as propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene carbonate (EC), acetonitrile (ACN), and tetramethylsulfone (TMS) favor crystallization due to their less Lewis basic nature.116 In order of increasing DN, a series of solvents is: ACN, TMS, PC, GBL, DMF, NMP, DMAC, DMSO, and DMPU.116 Therefore, based on the desired crystallization, solvent selection can be made. For instance, to synthesize single crystals of antimony perovskites, a solvent with a low DN must be chosen, and for thin films, a solvent with high DN must be chosen.
2.5. Scope for perovskite-like materials: antimony(V) halide complexes
In post-transition group 15, bismuth can form numerous halide complexes such as BiSI, Cs2AgBiX6, and BiOI, whereas antimony(III) halide has been confined to A3Sb2X9 and A2MSbX6 (M = monovalent cation).117 To date, antimony(III) and bismuth(III)-based halide complexes have shown very poor performances.105,118–122 Their low external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) depict an active layer with inefficiencies in the generation and transport of charge carriers. Sergey A. Adonin et al. reported the first antimony(V) halide complexes, ASbX6 (Fig. 1f), where A and X are the monovalent metal cation and halide anion, respectively. These complexes possess a perovskite-like pseudo-3D crystal structure with an 80% EQE and nearly 4% PCE in planar solar cell devices. In these antimony(V) halide complexes all [SbX6]− octahedra form an integrated 3D framework through halogen (X⋯X) interactions, which look similar to conventional perovskites (Fig. 2d).123
David A. Egger123 has analyzed these results using DFT. He performed periodic DFT calculations using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functions124 and the VASP plane-wave code.125 DFT calculations of the EtPySbBr6 electronic band structure along the high symmetry directions of the Brillouin zone (Fig. 2e), total density of states (Fig. 2f), charge density of the valence band (Fig. 2g), and intermediate band (Fig. 2h) have revealed that the orbital-hybridization effect of the antimony s-states leads to the formation of intermediate bands along with weaker X–X and stronger Sb–X hybridization.
In the 0D ASbX6 (EtPySbBr6) complex, these intermediate bands give rise to favorable optoelectronic properties. However, stability becomes a major issue for antimony(V) halide complexes; these complexes are even more unstable than MAPbI3. Hence, there is a need to obtain a new class of A(I)B(V)X6 lead-free materials with higher stability and performance. Therefore, utilizing the ions that can introduce intermediate bands evolved as a technique to synthesize low dimensional (0D) lead-free perovskites with significant optoelectronic properties.

2.6. A brief look at introducing antimony perovskite nanocrystals into device fabrication
Based on our comprehensive understanding of nanocrystals (NCs) (Fig. 1g), defect states (localized) are formed on their surface due to dangling bonds. These defect states exist deep within the band gap and trap charge carriers, which is detrimental to the performance of the material.126 Therefore, it is crucial to delocalize defect states so they can move into the conduction (CB) or valence band (VB). Antimony exhibits an ns2 electronic configuration as it forms both VB and CB with antibonding states. This unique character leads to a shift in the VB and CB, such that the deep defect states become shallow. Therefore, NCs formed by antimony are defect tolerant.
NCs have size-dependent bandgaps due to quantum confinement. Through different synthesis procedures and by using stabilizing ligands, the size of a NC can be tuned, which in turn results in tuning the bandgap.127,128 Therefore, incorporating these defect-tolerant antimony-based perovskite NCs with appropriate bandgaps into the devices promote the proper alignment of band offsets. To achieve the best performances, there is a need for interfacial engineering and different device architectures (Fig. 3a–h). Having multiple layers of differently sized NCs of the same or different material will result in better band alignment, which consequently results in minimal bimolecular recombination in solar cells and nonradiative recombination in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). These antimony perovskite NCs were used in the fabrication of efficient, bright LEDs with different architectures as well. Moreover, their unique properties along with inexpensive solution-processing techniques and ease of fabrication have advanced the field of antimony perovskite NCs towards applications in solar cells and LEDs.

3. Halide double perovskite solar cells
Another approach to replacing lead halide perovskites is halide double perovskites. Herein, the divalent cation Pb2+ is replaced by a monovalent and a trivalent cation to form A2B(I)B(III)X6 double perovskites, or by a tetravalent cation and a vacancy to form A2B(IV)X6 double perovskites (Table 3).
3.1. A2B(I)B(III)X6 double perovskites
Double perovskites have been synthesized since the 1970s; however, only a few types (Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2NaBiI6) have been employed in solar cells. Recently, Ma et al. studied the electronic properties of Cs2NaBX6 (B = Sb, Bi; X = Cl, Br, I; Fig. 4a) double perovskites by using first-principles calculations to predict the possibility of using these materials for optoelectronic applications. They have indirect bandgaps, which decrease when the Bi is replaced with Sb. If the B site is fixed, the bandgap reduces as the X site changes from Cl to Br to I. Their electron effective masses are small and hole effective masses are large. Cs2NaSbI6, Cs2NaBiI6, and Cs2NaSbBr6 have good absorption coefficients in the visible range. The materials containing chloride can form a stable double perovskite phase based on enthalpy of formation results.129

They also investigated Cs2NaBiI6 (Fig. 4b) as a light absorber in solar cells. Cs2NaBiI6 was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal process. It has a bandgap of 1.66 eV with a unique shuttle-like morphology. It is also highly stable and has good light absorption. The best Cs2NaBiI6 solar cell exhibited a PCE of 0.42% and its tolerance and octahedral factors were 0.849 and 0.466, respectively.130 Afterwards, Li et al. prepared a high-quality Cs2NaBiI6 double perovskite film using vacuum deposition followed by a post-treatment. This process enlarged the grain size, reduced the trap density, and removed by-products by soaking in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and annealing in a dimethylformamide (DMF) atmosphere. The cells exhibited a maximum PCE of 0.21% with a short-circuit current (JSC) of 0.91 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.70 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 33%, which was ten times higher than those of cells without post-treatment. In addition, these cells retain their initial PCEs after being stored under ambient conditions (humidity = ∼40%).131
Cs2AgBiBr6 is the most popular halide double perovskite for use in photovoltaic applications. Slavney et al. reported that Cs2AgBiBr6 shows a long photoluminescence (PL) lifetime of 660 ns, which is close to that of MAPbI3 (736 ns to 1 μs). They found that Cs2AgBiBr6 possesses many desirable properties similar to those of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, which are important for their application in solar cells. The high defect tolerance of Cs2AgBiBr6 was confirmed by comparing the PL decay curves of a Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystal (Fig. 4c) and powder. It has an indirect bandgap of 1.95 eV, and good moisture and thermal stability.132
McClure et al. used a solid-state reaction and solution process to synthesize double perovskites Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 (Fig. 4d). The cubic perovskite structure in the Fm3m space group was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Band gaps (2.19 eV for Cs2AgBiBr6, 2.77 eV for Cs2AgBiCl6) were obtained by diffuse reflectance measurements; they were found to be slightly smaller than those of the corresponding lead halide perovskites (2.26 eV for CH3NH3PbBr3 and 3.00 eV for CH3NH3PbCl3). According to the calculations, an indirect band gap was induced by the changed VBs which were caused by the interaction between the Ag 4d-orbitals and the halide 3p/4p orbitals. These materials are stable under atmospheric conditions; however, Cs2AgBiBr6 starts to degrade under atmospheric and irradiation conditions after a period of weeks.133 Hoye et al. reported that Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films show a fundamental lifetime of 1.4 μs using transient absorption spectroscopy, indicating that charge carriers in Cs2AgBiBr6 can survive in the thick active layer, which is beneficial for high current densities and power conversion efficiencies.134
Several research groups made important contributions towards using Cs2AgBiBr6 as a light harvester in solar cells. Igbari et al. prepared a Cs2AgBiBr6 halide double perovskite by vacuum and solution processes. Compared to the vacuum process, the solution process produced a higher crystallinity, lower bandgap, longer charge carrier lifetime, and higher mobility. The best performing vacuum and solution-processed solar cells exhibit PCEs of 1.41% and 2.51%, respectively. Until now, a PCE of 2.51% has been the highest PCE given by Cs2AgBiBr6-based solar cells. The improved device performance is because of the accurate stoichiometry of Cs2AgBiBr6 films formed by solution processing. Therefore, we conclude that solution processing has the advantage of precise control of the stoichiometry to obtain high-quality films.135 Moreover, Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite films were prepared by a fast spin-coating process. They found that high-temperature annealing (≥250 °C) is important to fully convert the precursors into the final Cs2AgBiBr6 product, and a preheating step is necessary to improve the optical properties of the Cs2AgBiBr6 films. The bandgap of the Cs2AgBiBr6 films in this work is comparable to those of single crystals and polycrystalline powders. The best performing solar cells show a PCE of 2.43% and a VOC of over 1 V. These cells also show high stability under illumination and ambient conditions. The Cs2AgBiBr6 films show similar absorption properties and PL lifetimes to those of lead-based perovskites according to light absorption measurements and steady-state and time resolved PL measurements.136
High quality and stable Cs2AgBiBr6 (Fig. 4e) double perovskite films were also prepared by a low-pressure assisted method to fabricate planar heterojunction solar cells. The effects of annealing on the crystallinity of the Cs2AgBiBr6 films and corresponding device performances were fully studied, resulting in the highest PCE of 1.44%, which is much higher than those of cells fabricated by a traditional thermal annealing method. These cells are much more stable than Sn-based perovskite solar cells. The hole transport material (HTM)-free cells almost retain their initial PCEs after storage under ambient conditions for 4 months.137 Wang et al. used a sequential-vapor-deposition method to prepare uniform Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films with smooth surfaces and a large grain size. Through optimization of the composition ratio and annealing process, Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films showed a long photoluminescence lifetime of 117 ns and long charge carrier diffusion lengths (electron: 140 nm, hole: 230 nm), indicating their potential in solar cell applications. The planar solar cells exhibited the highest PCE of 1.37% and retained 90% of initial PCEs after storage under ambient conditions for 240 h. The device structure was fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/SnO2 blocking layer/Cs2AgBiBr6/P3HT/Au.138
Ning et al. reported the first double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 planar solar cells using spin-coating. These films were made of high-quality crystal grains with sizes similar to the film thickness, which reduces the number of grain boundaries and hence carrier recombination. Excitons and free carriers were shown to coexist in the Cs2AgBiBr6 films based on analysis of the photophysical results. Electron–hole diffusion lengths in these films were approximately 110 nm, which is high enough to fabricate Cs2AgBiBr6 planar solar cells. These cells exhibit an average PCE of over 1% and a maximum PCE of 1.22%. They expected that the device performance could be further improved by choosing a more suitable electron transport layer material and increasing the film thickness while maintaining its high quality. The device structure is FTO/TiO2 blocking layer/Cs2AgBiBr6/spiro-OMeTAD/Au.139
Double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 films were also prepared by single-source vacuum deposition. The films annealed at 300 °C for 15 min had high crystallinity and were flat and pinhole-free. The annealing temperature, annealing time, and film thickness were optimized. The planar solar cells with a structure of FTO/TiO2/Cs2AgBiBr6/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag exhibited a highest PCE of 0.70%.140 Gao et al. prepared uniform and smooth Cs2AgBiBr6 films with small grains by using isopropanol (IPA) as an anti-solvent and controlling the annealing temperature. They found the high-temperature annealing process to be important when forming high crystallinity Cs2AgBiBr6 films. They reported the first inverted planar heterojunction solar cell with a device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/Cu-NiO/Cs2AgBiBr6/C60/BCP/Ag, which exhibits a high PCE of 2.23%, accompanied by a JSC of 3.19 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.01 V and an FF of 69.2%. These cells do not exhibit hysteresis and show excellent stability when stored in the air with 50% humidity for more than 10 days.141 This was the first time Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells without hysteresis and with increased VOC had been fabricated. A uniform and compact Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film was prepared by controlling the deposition conditions. The interface of Cs2AgBiBr6 was investigated using a new deposition process following a multistep optimization protocol. A compact Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film could be achieved, which enabled them to successfully infiltrate into mesoporous (mp)-TiO2. The effect of various HTMs on the device performance was investigated. The best-performing cells exhibited a PCE of 1.26% without hysteresis using PTAA as the HTM.142
A non-toxic, hybrid double perovskite, (MA)2AgBiBr6 (Fig. 4f), was also reported, which had an indirect band gap of ∼2 eV. Its electronic structure, optical properties, and mechanical properties were investigated by combining experiments and DFT calculations. Based on DFT calculations, the effect of spin–orbit coupling was reduced by the presence of Ag. This compound is stable under atmospheric conditions with humidity. Compared to MAPbBr3, it shows a higher decomposition temperature and a smaller Young's modulus.143
In addition, some doping related to A2B(I)B(III)X6 double perovskites was also done. Liu et al. incorporated Sb into double-perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 to obtain Cs2AgSbxBi1−xBr6 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) by a solution process where CsBr, AgBr, BiBr3, and SbBr3 were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide at 180 °C, and the resulting solution was dip-coated and annealed at 250 °C. These thin films showed good crystallinity and thermostability. The incorporation of Sb reduced the bandgap of Cs2AgSbxBi1−xBr6 from 2.22 eV (x = 0) to 1.97 eV (x = 0.75). The PCE of Cs2AgSbxBi1−xBr6 (x = 0.25) is significantly higher than that of Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells. The XRD and SEM results of the Cs2AgSbxBi1−xBr6 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) thin films show that Cs2AgSbxBi1−xBr6 has good crystallinity and thermostability, especially for high Bi content samples.144
Cs2SbAgCl6 and its Cu(II) doped double perovskite materials were also investigated. The bandgap of Cs2SbAgCl6 is reduced from 2.65 eV to 1.02 eV by a 10% Cu substitute. These materials show excellent thermal, moisture, and photo stability. DFT calculations indicate that these compounds have small carrier effective masses (<0.4 me), comparable to the calculated values of MAPbI3. They also proposed that a cation defect is induced by the Cu2+ doping, which increases the conductivity of the materials.145 Slavney et al. reported that the bandgap of Cs2AgBiBr6 was reduced by 0.5 eV through dilute alloying. The alloyed material shows a long PL lifetime, which reaches a microsecond. This material is the first double perovskite material which has comparable bandgap and PL lifetime to those of MAPbI3.
Tl+/Ag+ site mixing can occur in the high concentration Tl regime, as observed in (MA)2(Tl1−aBi1−b)–AgxBr6 (x = 0.2). Bi3+ will be replaced by Tl3+ in the low concentration Tl regime, as shown in Cs2(Ag1−aBi1−b)TlxBr6 (x = 0.075) (Fig. 4g) with the bandgap reduced by 0.5 eV (vs. Cs2AgBiBr6). According to the calculation results, a bandgap reduction (0.1 eV) and a conversion from indirect to direct can be achieved by dilute Tl+ alloying (e.g., (MA)2(Tl1−aBi1−b)AgxBr6, x = 0.06) at Ag+ sites, and replacing Bi3+ with Tl3+ can reduce the bandgap by 0.8 eV while maintaining an indirect bandgap. The (MA)2TlBiBr6 (Fig. 4h) double perovskite is also mentioned.146
Zhang et al. reported that the current density and PCE of solar cells can be effectively improved by doping Rb into Cs2AgBiBr6. Compared to Cs2AgBiBr6, the defect density of (Cs0.95Rb0.05)2AgBiBr6 and (Cs0.9Rb0.1)2AgBiBr6 is reduced by incorporating Rb. The average PCE of the (Cs0.9Rb0.1)2AgBiBr6 solar cells is almost 15% higher than that of the Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells. Rb3Bi2Br9 was observed in (Cs0.85Rb0.15)2AgBiBr6, indicating that an excessive doping concentration will harm the double perovskite structure and have a negative effect on device performance. The incorporation of Rb enhanced absorption at long wavelengths and reduced the defect density of (Cs1−xRbx)2AgBiBr6. The (Cs0.9Rb0.1)2AgBiBr6 solar cells showed a maximum PCE of 1.52% with an FF of 78.8%.147
The substituted double perovskites, Cs2Ag(Bi1−xInx)Br6 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75) and Cs2Ag(Bi1−xSbx)Br6 (x = 0, 0.125, and 0.375) were also synthesized. The substitution reduced the cubic lattice constant. The bandgap increased as the In content rose, whereas it decreased as the Sb content rose. The opposite bandgap growth is because of the different atomic configurations of these alloys.148 Hutter et al. compared the optoelectronic properties of Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgBi1−xSbxBr6 double perovskites. The bandgap of Cs2AgBi1−xSbxBr6 can be shifted from 2.0 to 1.6 eV as the Sb content increases, and the charge carrier mobility increases as the temperature decreases. Similar to lead-based perovskites, the charge-carrier mobility of Cs2AgBi1−xSbxBr6 is mainly determined by phonon scattering. These results indicate that Cs2AgBi1−xSbxBr6 materials are promising alternatives to lead-based perovskites.149
Indium-based A2B(I)B(III)X6 materials are also one of the main double perovskites. The reason for the instability of Cs2In(I)M(III)X6 (M = Bi, Sb; X = halogen) was analyzed by carrying out DFT calculations and experiments. Oxidation–reduction chemistry reactions should be considered when the stability of new perovskites is analyzed. They found that In(I) was oxidized to In(III), and Bi(III)/Sb(III) were reduced to neutral metals in Cs2In(I)M(III)X6, which made these materials unstable. Double perovskites based on In(I) will, therefore, decompose into the corresponding materials based on In(III). All experiments trying to form double perovskites based on In(I) failed, and instead formed In(III)-based materials with Bi3+/Sb3+ partially being reduced to metal. These results indicate that under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, Cs2In(I)M(III)X6 (M = Bi, Sb; X = halogen) double perovskites are unstable.150
A novel halide double perovskite, Cs2InAgCl6, was found by experimental studies and first-principles calculations. This material has a Fm3m space group and a direct band gap of 3.3 eV. It also exhibits a PL peak at approximately 2.1 eV. An interesting photochromic phenomenon where its color reversibly changes from white to orange was observed under UV illumination. Light absorbers with suitable and direct bandgaps can be obtained in Cs2InAgX6 (X = Cl, Br, and I) (Fig. 4i) materials with mixed halides. The successful formation of Cs2InAgCl6 indicates that the synthesis of Cs2InAgBr6 is also possible. The results of first-principles calculations indicate that Cs2InAgI6 has a direct band gap in the visible range, whereas the bandgap of Cs2InAgCl6 is in the UV range.151 The properties of indium-based double perovskites Cs2InMX6 (M = Cu, Ag, Au and X = Cl, Br, I) (Fig. 4j) and MA2InCuCl6 (Fig. 4k) were also investigated by DFT calculations. They proposed that Cs2InCuCl6 and MA2InCuCl6 are suitable for photovoltaic applications. According to their results, Cs2InCuCl6 has a direct band gap from 1.05 to 1.73 eV, whereas MA2InCuCl6 has an indirect band gap from 1.31 to 2.09 eV. Both Cs2InCuCl6 and MA2InCuCl6 exhibit higher absorption coefficients than crystalline (c)-Si and CdTe in the visible spectrum. Cs2InCuCl6 shows a comparable intrinsic charge carrier mobility along the L–Γ path to that of MAPbI3. They think that Cs2InCuCl6 and MA2InCuCl6 are promising light harvesters for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications.152
In addition, there are other types of A2B(I)B(III)X6 double perovskites which are worth exploring. For example, Cs2TlBiI6 (Fig. 4l) was proposed as a light harvester in solar cells. The structural, optical, and electronic properties of Cs2TlBiI6 were investigated using DFT calculations. Cs2TlBiI6 has a cubic double perovskite crystal structure with a Fm3m space group, a direct band gap of 1.37 eV and strong optical absorption in the visible light zone, indicating that Cs2TlBiI6 is a potential light absorber. The frequency-dependent electronic band structure, density of states, and dielectric properties of the optimized Cs2TlBiI6 crystal structure have been investigated. The static dielectric constant is 5.45, and the calculated optical absorption coefficient is on the order of 105 cm−1. Cs2TlBiI6 shows strong absorption in the visible region with a peak at ∼2.6 eV, and its exciton binding energy is about 85.7 meV. The effective masses are 1.05 me for an electron and 0.23 me for a hole.153
[MIIX6] octahedral layers were inserted into Cs3Sb2X9 to form Cs3+nM(II)nSb2X9+3n layered halide double perovskites according to the principles of increased electronic dimensionality. Combining matched cation orbitals and increased octahedral layer thickness can increase electronic dimensionality. Inserting [SnI6] or [GeI6] octahedra into the [Sb2I9] bilayers can reduce carrier effective masses, exciton binding energies, and bandgaps, enlarge dielectric constants, and enhance light absorption across the visible spectrum. It is important to adjust the thickness of inserted octahedral layers for different carrier effective masses and band gaps. The relatively small and negative decomposition enthalpies of Cs3+nM(II)nSb2X9+3n double perovskites indicate that these materials should be straightforward to synthesize.154
In some special cases, the B(I) and B(III) cations were provided by the same element. For example, Du et al. investigated the crystal, optical, electronic, and elastic properties of Cs2Au2X6 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) using DFT calculations. The effects of X site [AuX2]− and [AuX4]− clusters with various valence Au atoms on the properties of Cs2Au2X6 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) double perovskites were investigated. Their desirable properties including direct band gaps, high absorptions, low reflections, and low loss functions indicate that Cs2Au2X6 double perovskites are potential light harvesters for solar cell applications.155 Moreover, the properties of Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2In2X6 (X = F, Br) were compared to investigate the effect of metal and halide atoms on their optical and electronic properties based on calculations. In the case of Cs2AgBiBr6, the first absorption peak is due to a bound exciton near the X point, and a phonon-assisted radiative recombination process of indirect bound excitons is observed in the PL spectrum. The spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency of Cs2In2X6 (X = F, Br)-based solar cells was also predicted based on the calculated absorption coefficients and minimum bandgaps, and these materials have a high potential to improve device performance as light harvesters.156
3.2. A2M(IV)X6 double perovskites
The other type of double perovskite is vacancy-ordered perovskites, where the B′ and B′′ sites are occupied by a tetravalent cation and a vacancy. One of the most important vacancy-ordered perovskites is Cs2SnI6. Saparov et al. prepared continuous and well-structured Cs2SnI6 thin films using a two-step vacuum deposition method. Cs2SnI6 can be written as CsSn0.5I3, which is a 0D perovskite derivative with a one-half deficient Sn. Cs2SnI6 is an n-type semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.6 eV, carrier density of 6 × 1016 cm−3, low electron mobility of 2.9 cm2 V−1 s−1, and lower hole mobility. The ionization potential and electron affinity of Cs2SnI6 are 6.4 eV and 4.8 eV, respectively. These results show that Cs2SnI6 might be suitable for other applications beyond photovoltaics.157
The effects of substitution on the halide site and the incorporation of carbon on the structural and optical properties of Cs2SnIxCl6−x (x = 0, 2, and 6) (Fig. 5a) were also investigated using first-principles DFT calculations. Cs2SnIxCl6−x double perovskite nanofibers are prepared as a light absorber for potential photovoltaic applications. The optical properties and thermal stability of Cs2SnIxCl6−x were enhanced by incorporating a graphene oxide layer. Compared to pure halide materials, Cs2SnIxCl6−x shows much higher optical properties.158 Jong et al. studied the structural and phase stability as well as the optical and electronic properties of K2SnX6 (X = I, Br, Cl) double perovskites with monoclinic, cubic, and tetragonal crystal structures using first-principles calculations. The bandgaps, exciton binding energies, and effective carrier masses decreased as the symmetry of the phase or the size of the halide anion increased. Cubic K2SnBr6 and monoclinic K2SnI6 are potential light absorbers in solar cells because of their acceptable band gaps (K2SnBr6: 1.65 eV, K2SnI6: 1.16 eV) and low exciton binding energies (K2SnBr6: 59.4 meV, K2SnI6: 15.3 meV). Anharmonic phonon modes were observed in the cubic and tetragonal phases, but not in the monoclinic phases, due to vibrations of the K and X atoms. The cubic–tetragonal phase transition temperatures are 449, 433, and 281 K for X = I, Br, and Cl, respectively, and the tetragonal–monoclinic phase transition temperatures are 345, 301, and 210 K for X = I, Br, and Cl, respectively. These results summarize that K2SnX6 double perovskites are promising materials for photovoltaic applications.159

A two-step sequential deposition method was developed to deposit high-quality B-γ-CsSnI3 thin films. Unstable B-γ-CsSnI3 can be oxidized into air-stable Cs2SnI6, and Cs2SnI6 has a bandgap of 1.48 eV and an absorption coefficient of over 105 cm−1 from 1.7 eV. The Cs2SnI6 planar n–i–p solar cell exhibits a PCE close to 1% and excellent stability under ambient conditions.160 Lee et al. used Cs2SnI6−xBrx (x < 3) as a light harvester in the solar cell. The bandgaps of Cs2SnI6−xBrx range with x from 1.3 to 2.9 eV. Cs2SnI6−xBrx is more stable in air and humidity due to its Sn4+ state. The process to prepare Cs2SnI6−xBrx contains two steps. First, a well-defined CsI crystalline film is prepared, and then this is reacted with a solution of SnI2. Cs2SnI6−xBrx was sandwiched with an all-solid-state ionic conductor mixed with inorganic materials and succinonitrile to fabricate photochemical cells, which showed a maximum PCE of 2.1% when x is 2. An accurate stoichiometric composition is important for device performance.162 Lee et al. demonstrated the use of Cs2SnI6 (Fig. 5b) as the HTM in the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells. The molecular structure of Cs2SnI6 is similar to the 113 perovskites (e.g. CsSnI3) with one-half of the Sn atoms lost. Compared to CH3NH3SnI3 and CsSnI3, Cs2SnI6 is more stable in air and moisture because Sn is in the 4+ oxidation state. Thus, it can be processed in the atmosphere. The cells were fabricated using mp-TiO2 and Li-bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP)-doped Cs2SnI6 as the ETM and HTM, respectively. The cells achieved a PCE of 4.7% using Z907 as the dye and a PCE of close to 8% with a mixture of N719, YD2-o-C8 and RLC5 as dyes.163
In addition to Cs2SnI6, another important structure is Ti-based vacancy-ordered double perovskites. Ju et al. screened a series of Ti-based double perovskites (A2TiX6: A = K+, Rb+, Cs+, In+, MA+, or FA+; X = Cl, Br, or I) (Fig. 5c) for their potential applications in solar cells, and Cs2TiI6, Rb2TiI6, K2TiI6, and In2TiI6 were found to be promising light harvesters due to their advantages including suitable bandgaps, good optical absorption, benign defect properties, and high stability. Cs2TiI2Br4 and Cs2TiBr6 have bandgaps of 1.38 and 1.78 eV, which are suitable for single-junction and tandem photovoltaic applications, respectively. Compared to the traditional metal halide perovskites, both materials exhibit excellent intrinsic stability and contain the environmentally friendly metal Ti, which simultaneously solves the issues of Pb toxicity and poor long-term stability.163 A two-step vapor deposition method was developed to deposit high-quality Cs2TiBr6 (Fig. 5d) thin films. Cs2TiBr6 has a bandgap of 1.82 eV and photogenerated carrier-diffusion lengths of 121 nm (electrons) and 103 nm (holes). The performance of Cs2TiBr6 solar cells can be improved by inserting a C60 layer between the Cs2TiBr6 thin film and the TiO2 ETM. Cs2TiBr6 planar solar cells show a maximum PCE of 3.3% and are highly stable under the stresses of moisture, heat, and light.164
The silicon-based double perovskites (A2SiI6 (A = K, Rb, or Cs)) (Fig. 5e) were investigated using first-principles calculations. A2SiI6 perovskites exhibit suitable bandgaps, high and wide absorptions across the visible spectra, small carrier effective masses, and good mechanical stability, which are desirable for solar cell applications. K2SiI6 and Rb2SiI6 are potential light absorbers for fabricating efficient and stable lead-free perovskite solar cells due to their high thermal stability. A2SiBrmI6−m (m = 1, 2, or 3) double perovskites show suitable direct bandgaps (1.04 to 1.67 eV), indicating their potential as light harvesters.165
Te-based double perovskites, such as A2TeI6 (A = Tl, K, NH4, Rb, Cs, CH3NH3, and CH(NH2)2) (Fig. 5f), are also predicted to be potential light harvesters for optoelectronic applications. First-principles calculations were used to study the electronic and optical properties, and structural stability of Te-based double perovskites. These materials exhibit a series of desirable properties for photovoltaic applications such as suitable band gaps, good optical absorption, and structural stability. The bandgaps of Cs2TeI6, MA2TeI6, and FA2TeI6 from the calculations match well with experimental values and are suitable for single-junction solar cell applications.166
An in situ oxidization of Pd2+ to Pd4+ in a solution process was used to prepare Cs2PdBr6 (Fig. 5g). Cs2PdBr6 has a cubic crystal structure (Fm3m space group) and exhibits a long PL lifetime and bandgap of 1.6 eV. Based on DFT calculations, its effective masses are 0.53 me for an electron and 0.85 me for a hole, respectively, and it shows dispersive electronic bands. Cs2PdBr6 is also resistant to water. These results indicate that Cs2PdBr6 is suitable for optoelectronic applications.167 A microcrystal-mediated antisolvent process was also used to prepare all-inorganic Cs2PdBr6 nanocrystals, and Cs2PdBr6 can be transformed into Cs2PdI6 (Fig. 5h) NCs via anion exchange. The average particle size and thickness of Cs2PdBr6 thin films are 2.8 nm and 1 to 2 unit cells, respectively. Cs2PdBr6 has a bandgap of 1.69 eV and exhibits good optical and photophysical properties. Photocurrent responses of Cs2PdBr6 NCs have been detected at a bias voltage of 5 V and under light illumination, indicating its potential in photovoltaic applications.168
4. Mixed metal halide–chalcogenide perovskites
4.1. Chalcogenide-perovskite solar cells
To avoid toxic Pb and the inherent instability of lead-based perovskites, a new method is needed to develop chalcogenide perovskites to increase the choices of metals due to their high stability from strong metal-chalcogenide bonds. 168 types of chalcogenide ABX3 compounds (A = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Cd, Sn, Pb; B = Ti, Zr, Hf, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb; X = O, S, Se) with four different crystal structures (group symmetry Pm3m, Pnma, P63/mmc, and Pnma (needle-like)) were studied using DFT calculations. The band gap, optical absorption, carrier effective mass, phase stability, thermodynamic stability, and dynamic stability were analyzed to screen these materials for photovoltaic applications. Orthorhombic perovskites BaZrS3, BaHfSe3, SrZrSe3, SrHfSe3, and BaZrSe3 exhibited their potential for use in solar cell applications.169 Several chalcogenide and oxysulfide perovskites (BaZrS3, CaZrS3, SrZrS3, SrTiS3, and BaZr(OxS1−x)3) (Fig. 6a) have been synthesized. These materials show a bandgap range from UV to infrared. They are promising light harvesters in solar cells because of their rich properties including ferroelectricity, superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, and charge density waves, which are caused by the interplay of different degrees of freedom across similar energy scales.170 Subsequently, oxide films were also sulfurized to form BaZrS3 (Fig. 6b) thin films using pulsed laser deposition. It was found that BaZrS3 is suitable for optoelectronic applications due to its high absorption coefficient (>105 cm−1) at photon energies >2 eV, good carrier mobility (13.7 cm2 V−1 s−1), and defect tolerance.171

Niu et al. reported the Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite chalcogenide Ba3Zr2S7 (Fig. 6c). This material has a suitable bandgap for fabricating single-junction solar cells, a high absorption coefficient near the absorption edge, a photoluminescence peak at 1.28 eV, an external luminescence efficiency of 0.15%, and an effective minority carrier recombination time of 65 ns, indicating that Ba3Zr2S7 is a promising light absorber for solar cell applications.172 They also prepared high-quality BaZrS3 and its Ruddlesden–Popper phase Ba3Zr2S7 crystals using the flux growth method. According to XRD analysis, BaZrS3 has a space group of Pnma (a = 7.056(3) Å, b = 9.962(4) Å and c = 6.996(3) Å), while Ba3Zr2S7 has a space group of P42/mnm (a = 7.071(2) Å, b = 7.071(2) Å and c = 25.418(5) Å).173 Subsequently, they also synthesized a hexagonal perovskite chalcogenide with a quasi-1D structure, Sr1+xTiS3 (Fig. 6d). This material shows a strong dichroism window from 2.5 μm to 12 μm and a strong dichroism peak with a dichroic ratio of over 20 in the medium wavelength infrared (MWIR) region.174
Meng et al. studied the electrical, optical, and defect properties of BaZrS3 and its alloys (Fig. 6e) using first-principles calculations. They found that BaZr1−xTixS3 has the potential to act as a light harvester to achieve high-efficiency solar cells using ultrathin films. Its bandgap was reduced to 1.47 eV by replacing 10% Zr with Ti (x = 0.1), which is suitable for fabricating single-junction solar cells. At the same thickness, the theoretical power conversion efficiencies of BaZr1−xTixS3 alloys may be higher than those of lead-based halide perovskites. To reduce deep-level defects and obtain a high carrier density, BaZr1−xTixS3 should be synthesized under moderate conditions (near stoichiometric). However, BaZr1−xTixS3 perovskites are not easy to synthesize because they tend to decompose into corresponding ternary and secondary phases depending on their experimental synthesis.175
The photoinduced hot carrier relaxation dynamics in SrSnS3 and SrSnSe3 (Fig. 6f) were investigated using nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulation. Under similar excess energies, hot electrons and holes have a faster relaxation time in SrSnS3 (compared to SrSnSe3) because of its strong nonadiabatic couplings. The hot holes have a dramatically faster decay time than the hot electrons in both materials due to the small energy level differences in the VB and the high density of states. The hot carrier relaxation times in SrSnS3 and SrSnSe3 are longer than in lead-based perovskites, indicating their potential for photovoltaic applications.176
The effect of transition-metal and chalcogenide doping on the electronic structure and nonadiabatic dynamics of barium–zirconium sulfide (BaZrS3)-based perovskites were investigated. They found that symmetry (both structural and orbital) and decoherence may be the most important properties for photovoltaic applications.177 The underlying mechanism for the experimental paraelectric phenomenon of Ba3Zr2S7 (Fig. 6g) was explained using first-principles calculations, and they also provided theoretical guidance for designing Ruddlesden–Popper chalcogenide ferroelectric semiconductors for photovoltaic applications. They found that ferroelectricity is mainly determined by the tolerance factor, and materials with small tolerance factors exhibited a more stable ferroelectric ground state. Ca3Hf2Se7 and Ca3Zr2Se7 are promising candidates for photovoltaic applications due to their low band gaps and notable polarization.178
Peng et al. investigated the differences in the band structures of halide and chalcogenide perovskites. According to the first-principles calculations, the prototype cubic phase of chalcogenide perovskites exhibits indirect band gaps with the valence band maximum located at the R point and the conduction band minimum located at the Γ point in the Brillion zone. Thus, the optical transitions near band edges between chalcogenide perovskites and the corresponding halide perovskites are different. A linear correlation between the direct–indirect band gap difference for chalcogenide perovskites in the cubic phase and t (tolerance factor) + μ (octahedral factor) was found, which provides a viable way to search for chalcogenide perovskites with a quasi-direct band gap.179 Machine learning methods were also used to screen double chalcogenide perovskites for photovoltaic applications. Ba2AlNbS6, Ba2GaNbS6, Ca2GaNbS6, Sr2InNbS6, and Ba2SnHfS6 are recommended as promising light harvesters.180
2D Ruddlesden–Popper Ca3Sn2S7 (Fig. 6h), a direct-bandgap semiconductor, was reported using first-principles calculations and quasi-particle GW calculations. Ca3Sn2S7 is an isotropic, soft and flexible semiconductor. It has a direct quasi-particle bandgap of 0.5 eV, high optical absorption coefficient (105 cm−1), ultrahigh carrier mobility (6.7 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1), high Fermi velocity (3 × 105 m s−1), small carrier effective mass (0.04 m0), and a graphene-like linear electronic dispersion. These properties indicated its potential in infrared optoelectronic and high-speed electronic devices.181
4.2. Mixed chalcogenide and halide perovskite solar cells
Although much research has been done on chalcogenide perovskites, few solar cells based on these materials have been reported. Furthermore, the preparation of these materials requires high temperatures. Another chance to attain high-performing and stable lead-free perovskites is the split-anion method, in which chalcogenides and halides coexist as anions with the formula AB(Ch,X)3 based on mixed chalcogenide and halide perovskites.182 Meanwhile, the divalent cation (Pb2+, Sn2+) on the B site is replaced with a trivalent cation (Sb3+, Bi3+). Compared to metal halide bonds, metal chalcogenide bonds are stronger. Thus, we can expect that mixed chalcogenide–halide materials will show higher stability under a high humidity atmosphere.183
A small effective mass, a large dielectric constant, a valence band maximum with antibonding states and a high band dispersion level are desirable properties for highly efficient and defect-tolerant light harvesters.184,185 Most of the desired properties can be found in materials based on metal cations with ns2 valence electrons, owing to the high bandwidth conduction band caused from large spin–orbit effects and the high Born effective charge derived from their soft polarisability.186–188 Thus, halides and chalcogenides of Pb2+, Sn2+, Ge2+, Sb3+, and Bi3+ have become popular light harvesters for solar cells. In the past ten years, halide perovskite solar cells have exhibited excellent PCEs. However, their commercialization progress is limited by the toxicity of Pb and inherent poor stability. Compared to halide perovskite solar cells, metal chalcogenide solar cells show considerable high air stability; however, their PCEs are much lower. If chalcogenide and halide can coexist in one material containing metal cations with ns2 valence electrons, high PCE and stability should be expected. In addition, a wide bandgap range can be easily obtained from metal compounds in which halide and chalcogenide coexist as anions, and can be used in various applications including room temperature radiation detection, photovoltaic devices or transparent electronic devices. Furthermore, the properties of the materials containing chalcogenides and halides will change drastically because of the distinct properties of chalcogenide and halide elements, which might make them simultaneously possess the advantages of chalcogenides and halides. Thus, the materials, which contain a chalcogen (e.g., S or Se), a halide (e.g., Br or I) and a trivalent antimony (with a distinctive 5s2 electronic configuration), are expected to have comparable photovoltaic performances to Pb halide perovskites. In these materials, several electron and hole basins are close to the band extrema in their multi-valley electronic structures according to relativistic quasi-particle self-consistent GW theory. The ionization potentials of these materials are located in the range of 5.3 to 5.8 eV, which is suitable for photovoltaic action.189
Sun et al. partially replaced halogen anions with chalcogenides to obtain bismuth-based perovskites (CH3NH3BiChX2) (Fig. 7a) using first-principles calculations.182 These bismuth-based materials exhibited calculated direct band gaps from 1.24 to 2.00 eV, and they proposed that CH3NH3BiSeI2 and CH3NH3BiSI2, whose direct band gaps are 1.3 and 1.4 eV, respectively, would be promising absorber materials for photovoltaic applications.182 Therefore, this work on bismuth perovskites provides direction for antimony-based mixed chalcogenide–halide perovskites.

Hong et al. used DFT calculations to partially replace halogen anions with chalcogenide anions in AB(Ch,X)3 (A = Cs, Ba; B = Sb, Bi; Ch = chalcogen; X = halogen)-based inorganic mixed-anion perovskites. They found that these perovskite materials are thermodynamically unstable and would decompose into other phases, which is also confirmed by the formation of distinct chalcogenide and halide phases or mixed-anion non-perovskite phases in solid-state synthesis experiments.183 Based on these calculations, BiSI and BiSeI (Fig. 7b) are also expected to be promising light harvesters for photovoltaic applications due to their suitable electronic structures, low electron effective masses in the direction along the BiChI chains, high dielectric constants, and antibonding states at the top of the valence band. The previous poor performance of these cells is attributed to the 1D nature of their ribbon structure. Thus, these materials should be vertically oriented on the substrate to obtain efficient conduction pathways. In addition, the poor performance is also because of their large electron affinity (>4.9 eV), leading to band misalignments between these materials and common electron transport materials.190
After a series of theoretical studies, researchers also tried to synthesize mixed chalcogenide–halide perovskites experimentally. Seok et al. synthesized methylammonium antimony sulfur diiodide (MASbSI2) for the first time based on a chalcogenide–halide mixed perovskite (Fig. 7c). The MASbSI2 was synthesized by annealing MAI and SbSI at 150 °C in an inert atmosphere, where SbSI was prepared by annealing antimony triiodide (SbI3) and antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) at 150 °C in an inert atmosphere, and Sb2S3 was deposited onto an mp-TiO2 electrode by chemical bath deposition (CBD). A PCE of 3.08% under standard illumination conditions of 100 mW cm−2 was obtained in the MASbSI2 light-harvesting solar cells. In addition, the cells with encapsulation retained 90% of their initial PCE after storage under room temperature ambient conditions with a relative humidity of 60% for 15 days.191
As the intermediates for synthesizing mixed chalcogenide–halide antimony-based perovskites, antimony-based metal chalcohalides have also attracted much attention. Our group also reported that Pb2SbS2I3, antimony sulfoiodide (SbSI), and Sb0.67Bi0.33SI can be applied in solar cells as light harvesters. Pb2SbS2I3 is prepared by annealing lead iodide and antimony sulphide (deposited on mp-TiO2 by CBD at 300 °C under an inert atmosphere). A PCE of 3.12% under the standard illumination conditions of 100 mW cm−2 was achieved in the Pb2SbS2I3 solar cells sandwiched between an organic hole conductor and TiO2. The cells without encapsulation retained ∼90% of their initial performance after being stored under ambient conditions (∼50% humidity, ∼25 °C temperature) for 30 days.192 Since Pb is toxic, it was fully replaced in Pb2SbS2I3 with Sb to synthesize SbSI. SbSI is prepared by annealing antimony triiodide and antimony trisulfide (deposited on a mp-TiO2 electrode by CBD) at a low temperature (90 °C) (Fig. 7d). A PCE of 3.05% under standard illumination conditions of 100 mW cm−2 was achieved in the SbSI light-harvesting solar cells. In addition, the unencapsulated cells retained 93% of their initial PCE after being stored under ambient conditions (∼60% humidity, ∼25 °C temperature) for 15 days.193
The efficiency of SbSI-based solar cells is still low, mainly due to their broad bandgap. To improve the PCE, they incorporated Bi into SbSI to synthesize alloyed Sb0.67Bi0.33SI (ASBSI). ASBSI was prepared by multiple spin-coating and thermal annealing cycles, in which bismuth triiodide in N,N-dimethylformamide solution reacted with an antimony trisulfide film (deposited on a mp-TiO2 electrode by CBD) at 250 °C under an inert atmosphere. Compared to that of SbSI (2.15 eV), the bandgap of ASBSI is much narrower (1.62 eV). A PCE of 4.07% under the standard illumination conditions of 100 mW cm−2 was obtained in the ASBSI light-harvesting solar cells. The unencapsulated cells kept 93% of the initial PCE after 1 sun illumination for 1254 min, 92% after storage under ambient conditions (∼60% humidity) over 360 h, and 92% after storage at 85 °C under ambient conditions (∼20% humidity) for 360 h, respectively.194
In addition, Li et al. synthesized bismuth chalcogenide iodide compounds (Bi13S18I2 and BiSI) using a solvothermal process. The formation of Bi13S18I2 and BiSI are determined by their synthesis conditions, such as the S/Bi molar ratio, reaction temperature, and solvent. BiSI and Bi13S18I2 were synthesized under low and high S/Bi molar ratio conditions. Due to their ribbon and chain-like structures, the morphologies of both Bi13S18I2 and BiSI are rod-like. Bi13S18I2 is an n-type semiconductor and a promising light absorber for photovoltaic applications due to its strong light absorbance across a wide wavelength range from UV to near-IR (bandgap: ∼0.75 eV). The preliminary Bi13S18I2 solar cells show a PCE of 0.85%, showing its potential for photovoltaic applications.195 N-BiSI thin films were also synthesized using a spray pyrolysis technique. The BiSI films were converted into BiS1−xSex by incorporating SeO2, which reduced the bandgap from 1.63 to 1.48 eV. BiSI and BiS1−xSexI electrochemical solar cells using the I−/I2 redox couple were fabricated, and the BiSI electrochemical cells exhibited a PCE of 0.25%. A very poor PCE (0.01%) was achieved in the BiSI solid-state heterojunction solar cells with p-CuSCN as a window layer, which is due to charge recombination in the BiSI layer and light scattering by the CuSCN layer.196 Hahn et al. also prepared n-type BiSI thin films by the spray pyrolysis deposition. The films showed microrod morphologies, matching well with its microscopic crystal structure. The PEC testing of these films in NaI/acetonitrile shows photocurrents of up to 5 mA cm−2 under AM1.5G illumination and strong photoconversion efficiencies of 25 to 40% throughout the visible range, indicating the potential of BiSI as a light harvester in solar cells.197 Choi et al. prepared SbSI thin films using an advanced two-step solution process at a temperature of 200 °C from an am-Sb2S3 film, which was prepared using a precursor (SbCl3:thiourea = 1:3) in DMF. The planar SbSI solar cell exhibited a PCE of 0.93% without hysteresis.198 They also prepared BiSI films with a bandgap of 1.61 eV using a two-step solution process, in which Bi2S3 was formed first, and then it was converted into BiSI at a temperature of 200 °C. They found BiSI to be an n-type semiconductor with CB and VB of 4.3 and 5.9 eV, respectively. The mismatch between the CB of BiSI and common electron-transporting materials might be the reason for the poor performance of BiSI solar cells.199
The use of divalent chalcogenides and monovalent halides as anions in one material not only provides the chance to make use of chalcogenides and halides but also allows the introduction of 3+ and 4+ charged cations to replace the 2+ metal cations in perovskite materials. This kind of replacement avoids the toxicity of Pb2+ and instability of Sn2+, and provides more choices of metal cations for perovskites. Currently, most researchers are only focused on lead and tin halide perovskite solar cells. Thus, developing new research direction such as mixed chalcogenide and halide perovskites are of top priority. Although the PCEs of mixed chalcogenide and halide perovskite solar cells are still low, these research works open the door of mixed chalcogenide and halide perovskites and provide the intermediates for synthesizing new perovskites. Because mixed chalcogenide and halide perovskites are unknown materials, considerable DFT calculations are needed, and preparing single crystals of these materials is a solid approach to confirm these materials. Due to the distinct properties of chalcogenide and halide elements, investigations on the preparation methods are important.
5. Summary and outlook
Lead toxicity is a major factor hindering the commercialization of perovskite applications. Hence, many studies have focused on finding efficient and stable lead-free perovskite materials. In this perspective, we focused mainly on strategies for the expulsion of the detrimental element lead (Pb) from perovskites to obtain a non-hazardous active material. Based on the ionic radius and the electronic configuration, we presented elements that can replace lead in the perovskite to attenuate its toxicity. Since the replacement of Pb2+ with Sn2+ makes materials more unstable, and no other divalent metal cation can show equivalent anomalous optoelectronic properties, we highlighted various approaches to attain high-performing, stable, lead-free perovskites using hetero-valent substitutes. Herein, we discussed A3B2X9 structure perovskites, halide double perovskites, and mixed metal halide–chalcogenide perovskites.
Regarding A3B2X9 perovskites, the impacts of the different monovalent cations (A), monovalent anions (X), and chalcogenides (Ch) that are attributed to the stability and performance of antimony perovskites have been discussed. The effects of different solvents on the perovskite crystallization, antimony(V)-based perovskites, incorporating antimony-based quantum dots into the device layers are also mentioned. In the case of halide double perovskites, these materials are discussed in two parts: A2B(I)B(III)X6 and A2B(IV)X6 double perovskites. Cs2NaBiI6, Cs2AgBiBr6, Cs2SnI6−xBrx and Cs2TiBr6 solar cells have been fabricated with accepted PCEs. The bandgap of Cs2AgBiBr6 is significantly decreased by Sb, Cu, and Tl doping, whereas it is increased by In doping. In(III)-based double perovskites are found to be stable, while In(I) double perovskites are unstable. Cs2Au2X6 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) and Cs2In2X6 (X = F, Br) are double perovskites with B(I) and B(III) occupied by the same element. In addition, 168 types of chalcogenide compounds ABX3 (A = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Cd, Sn, Pb; B = Ti, Zr, Hf, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb; X = O, S, Se) were screened using DFT calculations, and orthorhombic perovskites such as BaZrS3, BaHfSe3, SrZrSe3, SrHfSe3, and BaZrSe3 were recommended as light harvesters in solar cells. However, few solar cells based on chalcogenide perovskites have been reported, and the preparation of these materials usually requires high temperatures.
To solve these problems, mixed chalcogenide and halide perovskites provide a promising pathway to achieve high efficiency and stability in solar cells. Our group demonstrated methylammonium antimony sulfur diiodide (MASbSI2)-based chalcogenide–halide mixed perovskite solar cells, and some intermediates including Pb2SbS2I3, SbSI, and Sb0.67Bi0.33SI were also applied in solar cells as light harvesters. These cells show acceptable PCEs and good stabilities. However, compared to those of lead perovskite solar cells, the efficiencies are still poor, and the bandgaps of most materials are wide. In addition, the process to prepare these materials requires multiple cycles of spin-coating and annealing. Nonetheless, more research should be done in the future on the topics as follows:
(1) Materials exploration: as we mentioned above, the materials containing a chalcogen (e.g., S or Se), a halide (e.g., Br or I), and a trivalent antimony (with a distinctive 5s2 electronic configuration) are expected to have comparable photovoltaic performances to Pb halide perovskites. If we consider the A site in perovskites which contain materials such as MA, FA, Cs, Rb, there are many potential combinations. Exploring these materials in theory and experimentally will provide more choices for light harvesters.
(2) Property investigations: due to the distinct properties of chalcogenide and halide elements, the properties of the materials containing chalcogenides and halides will change drastically, but they might still possess the advantages of chalcogenides and halides. Thus, investigating the structural, phase, optical, and electronic properties of these materials is highly necessary. As a potential light absorber, some properties such as suitable bandgaps, high absorption coefficients, bandgap structures, carrier lifetimes, defect tolerance, and structural stability are desirable. Crystal dimensions are also important for a material, and most high-efficiency light harvesters have a 3D crystal structure. Low dimension materials usually have higher stabilities at the expense of efficiency.
(3) Bandgap tuning: although we have applied several mixed chalcogenide and halide light absorbers to solar cells, their PCEs are still low. The main reason for this is their large bandgap, which directly limits light absorption, resulting in a low JSC. Therefore, future work should focus on reducing the bandgap; for example, replacing Sb and S with a small amount Bi and Se, respectively. The halide composition is also important. The bandgaps of iodine compounds are usually smaller than those of the corresponding bromide and chloride compounds.
(4) Preparation methods: because of the distinct properties of chalcogenides and halides, our previous mixed chalcogenide and halide materials were mainly prepared by two-step methods. The first step was to prepare a metal chalcogenide, and the second step was to transform the metal chalcogenide into the corresponding metal chalcohalides by reacting it with a metal halide solution. These processes require multiple cycles of spin-coating and annealing; what's more, the morphologies of these materials are not uniform, which affects the ability of photon-generated carriers in light harvesters to transfer into the ETM and HTM, resulting in poor efficiencies. We recommend formation of mixed chalcogenide and halide materials in one step by using a solution containing the precursor of metal chalcogenides and metal halides at a low temperature, which will lead to high-quality products and save the time.
(5) Device structures: device structure is a key factor in fabricating high-efficiency solar cells. Most mixed chalcogenide and halide-based solar cells are still focused on using a dye-sensitized structure. This kind of device structure might lead to a low VOC. To improve the VOC, a planar structure is encouraged to be used. In addition, ETMs and HTMs are crucial for device performance. The ETMs and HTMs in our previous work are mainly limited to TiO2 and poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT), respectively. Many ETMs (e.g., SnO2, ZnO, and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) and HTMs (e.g., P3HT, spiro-OMeTAD, and PTAA) could be tested. An inverted device structure is also a good option to obtain high VOCs.
Overall, mixed chalcogenides and halides provide a new pathway to achieve high efficiency and stability in lead-free perovskite solar cells. Finally, we believe in and manifest a hope for a future of lead-free perovskites enabled by mixing chalcogenides and halides.
