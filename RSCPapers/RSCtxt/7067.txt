    , Accepted 9th November 2018First published on 12th November 2018AbstractZeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have been widely utilized as templates to construct hollow or porous nanostructures with superior catalytic properties for various electrocatalytic reactions. In this work, we reported that a leaf-like cobalt phosphide nanoarray topology assembled on carbon cloth (CoP NS/CC) built through annealing followed by phosphorization of the template precursor of the ZIF-L-Co nanosheet array on CC could serve as an efficient versatile catalyst for water electrolysis. This CoP NS/CC exhibits satisfactory HER, OER and full water-splitting efficiencies, with overpotentials of 90 mV and 310 mV and a voltage of 1.67 V needed to afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Also, this electrode shows an excellent and stable HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 with a low overpotential of 88.7 mV required to attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2. In this regard, a novel acid|base hybrid overall water-splitting electrolyzer with this CoP NS/CC serving as both the anode and cathode was further built, wherein cell voltages of just 0.735 (onset voltage) and 0.9 V were needed to afford overall current densities of 1 and 10 mA cm−2, respectively.
Increasing energy demand and environmental issues resulting from fossil fuel combustion have aroused much interest in hunting for renewable and clean energy sources.1 Hydrogen (H2) has been considered as an ideal alternative to fossil fuels because it could provide a clean renewable energy system without the associated emissions that arise from the combustion of coal, oil and natural gas.2,3 Electrolytic water splitting with zero carbon emission has been regarded as a valid approach to achieve clean and sustainable H2 fuel.4 A typical water-splitting system always involves two half reactions, including the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER),5 which require active electrocatalysts to overcome the reaction activation energy barriers and improve the electron-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency.6 Pt- and Ru/Ir-based compounds are well-documented and considered to be benchmark catalysts for HER/OER catalysis,7 respectively. However, their low natural abundance, poor durability, and inherent high price hinder their scale-up application in electrolysis systems.8 Huge efforts have thus been devoted to exploring alternative non-precious metal, stable and highly efficient HER and OER catalysts, especially pH-universal/bifunctional electrode materials.
Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), as a typical subset of a vast array of porous, three-dimensional coordination solids known as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with a tetrahedral network structurally similar to aluminosilicate zeolites,9–11 have been well employed in the fields of gas storage, heterogeneous catalysis, molecular separation, sensing and energy storage by virtue of their good thermal and chemical stability, microporous structure, large surface area, easily realized functionalization on both internal and external sites and tunable pore aperture.10,11 In this big family of ZIFs, ZIF-67 and ZIF-8, consisting of inorganic metal centers (Zn2+/Co2+) tetrahedrally coordinated to imidazole-derived organic linkers (2-methylimidazole), have aroused particular interest in the design of electrode materials for electrocatalysis and fabrication of supercapacitors and batteries.10,12 Nevertheless, considering that the crystal structures of ZIF-type MOFs are not stable in both strong acid and base,9,13,14 ZIF-67 and ZIF-8 have always been preferred to be used as ideal precursor templates to design various porous nanostructured metal oxides, metal oxides/nitrogen-doped carbon (NC), metals@metal oxides/NC and metals/NC materials through annealing under different gas atmospheres for catalyzing various electrocatalytic reactions like water splitting and oxygen/carbon-dioxide reduction reactions.15–21 Notably, the pyrolysis process often causes the loss of organic ligands and agglomeration of metals, which might destroy the structure, sacrifice the ZIFs' intrinsic molecular metal active sites and further lead to a decreased catalytic activity.8,9,22 Also, the above ZIF-8/ZIF-67 derived compounds commonly show poor or even no HER activity, which largely restricts their usage as effective bifunctional catalysts for water splitting. Therefore, how to simultaneously endow ZIF-67/ZIF-8 based catalytic materials with good stability at various pH values, abundant catalytically active sites and good HER activity has thus stimulated intensive interest in the last several years.
Considering that transition-metal phosphides (TMPs) have been proven to be excellent bifunctional HER/OER catalysts toward water electrolysis,23–25 one proposed effective strategy is to further convert these ZIF-67 derived cobalt oxides, cobalt oxides/NC and cobalt/NC into cobalt-based phosphides or phosphides/NC with increased active sites, enhanced conductivity, native pH-universal superior HER and improved alkaline OER activities. Several advances in this strategy have been achieved recently. Jiang et al. utilized ZIF-67/graphene oxide (GO) as the template precursor to prepare a layered CoP/reduced GO composite with excellent alkaline HER and OER performances;26 Luo's group introduced CoP nanoparticles encapsulated in ultrathin NC through a MOF-derived route with high acidic and alkaline HER performances.27 Lou's group reported ZIF-67 based carbon incorporated Ni–Co phosphide nanoboxes toward excellent OER catalysis;28 Wang et al. introduced ZIF-67 derived hollow CoP nanosphere embedded carbon nanotube (CNT)/NC nanoarrays that could well drive the HER at all pH values;29 Li et al. reported that a core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 derived CoP nanoparticle-embedded N-doped CNT hollow polyhedron could serve as a bifunctional catalyst for efficient overall water splitting.30 Although these studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using ZIF-67 as the precursor to synthesize cobalt phosphides with native high HER/OER activities, further rational design of ZIF-67 derived cobalt phosphide nanoarrays with abundant exposed active sites, high bifunctionality toward the whole water-splitting reaction and no use of insulated polymer binders like Nafion still needs to be pursued.
Inspired by the above considerations, we reported that a leaf-like cobalt phosphide nanoarray topology assembled on carbon cloth (CoP NS/CC) built through annealing followed by phosphorization of the template precursor of ZIF-L-Co could serve as an efficient bifunctional catalyst toward overall water electrolysis. The open-shelled porous nanosheet array structure and high phosphorus content endowed the obtained CoP NS/CC with improved conductivity and more exposed active sites, and facilitated electrolyte penetration and O2 diffusion. To be specific, in 1.0 M KOH, this CoP NS/CC exhibits satisfactory HER, OER and whole water-splitting efficiencies with overpotentials of 90 mV and 310 mV and a voltage of 1.67 V needed to afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Furthermore, considering that this electrode also shows an excellent and stable HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 with a low overpotential of 88.7 mV required to attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and the fact that strong acidic and alkaline conditions are always preferred for catalysts to generate H2 and O2, respectively, a novel acid|base hybrid water-splitting electrolyzer with the CoP NS/CC serving as both the anode and cathode was further built, wherein a cell voltage of just 0.9 V was needed to afford an overall current density of 10 mA cm−2. The feasibility of using simulated solar energy to drive the above alkaline and acid|base hybrid overall water-splitting systems was also confirmed.
In this work, we chose carbon cloth as the 3D substrate to integrate a ZIF-L-Co nanosheet array for subsequent annealing and phosphorization conversion, in view of its low cost, commercial availability, textile nature, and high conductivity, as well as excellent flexibility and mechanical strength.31 The fabrication process of CoP NS/CC is illustrated in Fig. 1a and relevant experimental details are shown in the ESI.† An obvious color change from blue (ZIF-L-Co precursor) to black (derivatives) could be well observed after annealing and phosphorization treatments (Fig. S1a†). The micro-morphologies of bare CC, Co-MOF NS/CC, Co3O4 NS/CC and CoP NS/CC were recorded by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as depicted in Fig. 1b–e. Obviously, after a facile ambient liquid-phase deposition, the randomly oriented ZIF-L-Co flakes with vertical 2D morphology were uniformly grown on the CC (Fig. 1b and c). A closer view in the inset of Fig. 1c proves that these ZIF-L-Co units have an interconnected leaf-like smooth nanosheet structure. After annealing, the as-obtained Co3O4 product still retained a well-defined nanosheet array topology (Fig. 1d) with a rough surface and thinner thickness (inset). And after a typical phosphorization conversion process, the leaf-like nanoarray structure of the derived CoP phase was also well maintained (Fig. 1e) with an enlarged open space between adjacent layers. The longitudinal-sectional closer views of these CoP nanosheets (inset in Fig. 1e and S2a†) demonstrate that each unit has a rougher surface and a thin thickness of ∼180 nm, while the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. S2b†) shows that the height of the CoP nanosheet array is ∼4.5 μm. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum and elemental distributions (Fig. S3†) further confirm the presence and homogeneous distribution of Co and P elements on the surface of CoP NS/CC with an approximate atomic ratio of 1:1. Besides, the flexural properties of the derived CoP NS/CC tested by deforming it under different bending states (Fig. S1b–h†) manifests the good mechanical flexibility of this electrode. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 1f) of an individual CoP unit scratched from the CC also proves its leaf-like nanosheet nature. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1g and h) recorded from the marked “1” and “2” areas in Fig. 1f both display a lattice fringe with an interplanar spacing of 0.25 nm, corresponding well with the (111) plane of CoP (JCPDS no. 29-0497).25,32 The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1i) exhibits clear rings indexed to the (111), (112) and (301) planes of hexagonal CoP.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of bare CC, Co-MOF NS/CC, Co3O4 NS/CC and CoP NS/CC were further recorded to investigate the crystal phase transformation in this synthetic process. Obviously, the XRD pattern of bare CC (black curve in Fig. 2c) shows two broad peaks at 2θ = 26° and 44° (marked with “♦”) ascribed to the (002) and (101) reflections of typical sp2-bonded hexagonal graphitic carbon (JCPDS no. 75-1621),33 respectively, proving the crystalline carbonaceous structure of CC. In the XRD pattern of Co-MOF NS/CC (Fig. 2b and c), except for the two typical broad peaks assigned to the CC substrate, all other peaks correspond to the diffraction pattern of the reported leaf-like ZIF-67 phase (also expressed as ZIF-L-Co).9,34,35 Note that the ZIF-L-Co exhibits a different crystal structure with a space group of Cmce compared with the reported common ZIF-67 materials with sodalite topology and a space group of I43m.9,34,35 The XRD pattern of the air-annealed product (Fig. 2a and c) only shows the characteristic diffraction peaks ascribed to the cubic Co3O4 (JCPDS no. 42-1467) and CC. After phosphidation, besides signals originating from the CC, all other diffraction peaks of the product could be indexed to orthorhombic CoP (JPCDS no. 29-0497) (red curve in Fig. 2c), indicative of the successful crystal phase transformation of ZIF-L-Co into the CoP phase.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was employed to further elucidate the surface elemental compositions and valence states of the CoP NS/CC. The XPS survey spectrum of this as-prepared sample (Fig. S4†) verifies the presence of Co and P elements, as well as C and O elements, which might arise from the contamination and superficial oxidation upon contact with air.36,37 In the fine-scanned Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 2d), except for two spin–orbit doublets at the binding energies (BEs) of 784.6 and 803.2 eV corresponding to the shakeup satellites (identified as “Sat.”), the BEs located at 779.2 eV for Co 2p3/2 and 794.1 eV for Co 2p1/2 are characteristic of Co3+, while the BEs located at 782.2 eV for Co 2p3/2 and 798.6 eV for Co 2p1/2 are characteristic of Co2+.31,38,39 Of note, the total peak area of the Co2+ state in the Co 2p spectrum is calculated to be almost equal to that of Co3+ (Table S1†), suggesting that the ratio of Co2+ to Co3+ states in the CoP phase is close to 1:1. The P 2p core level spectrum (Fig. 2e) reveals three peaks at 129.8, 130.7 and 134.6 eV, out of which the two former peaks are characteristic of low-valence P species in CoP and the latter one could be assigned to the surface-derived oxidized P species due to exposure to air.37 Besides, the BET surface areas of ZIF-Co-L, Co3O4, and CoP nanosheet powders were determined to be 43.51, 32.78, and 23.32 m2 g−1 (Fig. S5†), respectively. It should be noted that, after phosphorization, the surface area further decreases, which could be explained by the observation that several pores in the CoP nanosheets were blocked or collapsed during the phosphorization calcination process.40
The well-aligned open-shelled porous nanosheet array topology and phosphide nature are expected to endow the CoP NS/CC with excellent electrocatalytic activity toward alkaline water splitting. To evaluate the HER performance of the CoP NS/CC, a standard three-electrode electrochemical apparatus was constructed using 1.0 M KOH as the electrolyte, a graphite plate as the counter electrode, the as-prepared CoP NS/CC as the working electrode and a mercuric oxide electrode (MOE) as the reference electrode. Bare CC and ZIF-L-Co derived Co3O4 NS/CC were also tested for comparison under identical conditions. All the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were corrected with iR-compensation to neutralize the ohmic potential drop losses coming from electrolyte resistance.41,42Fig. 3a and b show the LSV curves of CoP NS/CC toward the HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Obviously, the CoP NS/CC has small overpotentials of 90 mV for the HER and 310 mV for the OER to afford a current density of ±10 mA cm−2, making it superior to its Co3O4 NS/CC precursor with inferior HER and OER performances. Also, to the best of our knowledge, both the HER and OER activities of this CoP NS/CC are comparable or superior to those of most reported advanced HER/OER catalysts. Detailed comparisons of the HER and OER performances are summarized in Tables S2 and S3,† respectively. Considering the difference of mass loading of CoP and Co3O4 phases on CC, the mass-normalized HER and OER performances of CoP NS/CC and Co3O4 NS/CC were also recorded (Fig. S6†). The results prove the native higher catalytic activity of CoP NS/CC toward the HER and OER.

Insets: LSV curves before and after electrolysis. 
Moreover, the reaction kinetics of the CoP NS/CC for the HER and OER were evaluated by recording their Tafel slopes from the Tafel plots (Fig. 3c and d). The linear portions of the Tafel plots are fitted to the Tafel equation (η = blogj + a, where j is the current density, b is the Tafel slope, and a is the intercept relative to the exchange current density j0).43 In contrast to the Co3O4 NS/CC (96.4 mV dec−1 for the HER and 93.3 mV dec−1 for the OER) and Co-MOF NS/CC (88.1 mV dec−1 for OER), the CoP NS/CC has much smaller Tafel slopes of 53.9 mV dec−1 for the HER and 70.8 mV dec−1 for the OER, revealing its favorable catalytic kinetics for these two reactions. Meanwhile, of note, both the OER performance and Tafel slope of Co-MOF NS/CC are better than those for Co3O4 NS/CC, which could be due to the loss of organic ligands, agglomeration of metals and sacrifice of the ZIFs' intrinsic molecular metal active sites in the pyrolysis process.8,9,22Fig. 3e and f show the multi-step chronopotentiometric curves in 1.0 M KOH without iR corrections for the CoP NS/CC toward the HER and OER with cathodic and anodic current densities from −10 to −110 and 10 to 100 mA cm−2, respectively, with an increment of ±10 mA cm−2 per 500 s. Apparently, the potentials at various applied current densities remained stable for each consecutive 500 s and could rapidly alter to another one in a split second, and there are almost no differences in the HER and OER LSV curves before and after electrolysis for over 5000 s (insets in Fig. 3e and f), manifesting the excellent mass/electron transfer as well as mechanical robustness of the CoP NS/CC for both the HER and OER in a base.44 Also, the CoP NS/CC was further proven to be able to stably drive long-term HER and OER catalysis (Fig. S7†).
To investigate the changes in the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and charge-transfer kinetics on the surface of this catalyst before and after annealing and the subsequent phosphidation process, we further recorded the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) data of bare CC, ZIF-L-Co NS/CC, Co3O4 NS/CC, and CoP NS/CC. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement is always used for calculating the ECSA, since the capacitive currents associated with electrical double-layer charging are considered to be able to quantify the accessible surface area between the active sites and the electrolyte.45Fig. 4a–d show the typical cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of these electrodes in 1.0 M KOH in the potential window of 0.3–0.4 V vs. MOE at scan rates ranging from 10–100 mV s−1, in which the CV responses are ascribed to the double-layer charging. The capacitive current density difference (Δj) at 0.35 V as a function of scan rate (Fig. 4e) derived from the above CVs shows that the Cdl values of CoP NS/CC, Co3O4 NS/CC, ZIF-L-Co NS/CC, and bare CC are 118.68, 17.25, 62.17, and 2.06 mF cm−2, respectively. Owing to the fact that the Cdl value is positively correlated with the ECSA,46 we could conclude that the ECSA of CoP NS/CC is about 6.9 and 1.9 times as large as those of Co3O4 NS/CC and ZIF-L-Co NS/CC, respectively, meaning that the CoP NS/CC displays a much higher exposure of effective catalytically active sites. Meanwhile, the Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 4f suggest that the CoP NS/CC has a lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) than other controlled catalysts, indicative of its superior charge-transfer kinetics under OER operating conditions.47 Of note, the Rct value of Co3O4 NS/CC is much higher than that of ZIF-L-Co NS/CC, which might be due to the agglomeration of the central metal in ZIF-L-Co after annealing. Both the decreased ECSA and charge-transfer kinetics should be responsible for the inferior OER properties of Co3O4 NS/CC. Here, the excellent HER and OER performances of CoP NS/CC could be explained by the following aspects: (i) the increased catalytically active sites enabled by the dramatically enlarged ECSA; (ii) the improved charge-transfer kinetics enabled by the introduction of phosphorus into the Co3O4 phase and the unique nanoarray structure; and (iii) the facilitated electrolyte penetration and O2 diffusion enabled also by the open-shelled porous nanosheet array structure.

(f) The Nyquist plots of CoP NS/CC, Co3O4 NS/CC, Co-MOF NS/CC and bare CC measured in 1.0 M KOH. 
Inspired by the superior bifunctionality of the CoP NS/CC toward both the HER and OER in a base, we further evaluated its potential for driving the overall water-splitting system by employing this catalyst as both the anode and cathode in a two-electrode alkaline cell. As depicted in Fig. 5a, the CoP NS/CC exhibits a superior overall water-electrolysis performance with a cell voltage of 1.67 V needed to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is not only much better than those of the ZIF-L-Co NS/CC and Co3O4 NS/CC, but also comparable or superior to the performances of reported advanced alkaline full water-splitting devices (Table S4†). The long-term durability of this water electrolyzer working at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 was recorded two times (Fig. 5b). Obviously, after the continuous electrolysis process for over 20 h, only slight voltage decay was shown in the LSV curve compared with the initial one (inset in Fig. 5b), demonstrating the good stability of this CoP NS/CC (+, −) pair-based water-splitting system. Moreover, the feasibility of this electrolysis system powered by a 2.0 V solar panel under irradiation with a commercial 300 W xenon lamp was also investigated. Specifically, in this serial system, the anodic and cathodic CoP NS/CC were connected to the positive and negative terminals of the solar panel, respectively, while a digital multimeter was connected in parallel to the terminals of the solar panel (Fig. 5c and Movie S1†).48 In a closer view of the electrolyzer, the evolution of numerous H2/O2 bubbles on/near the surface of both electrodes could be clearly observed at a voltage of 1.67 V (Fig. 5d and Movie S2†), proving that solar energy is capable of driving this CoP NS/CC (+, −) pair-based overall water-splitting device to generate H2 and O2.

(d) Closer view of the electrode surfaces of CoP NS/CC in this solar panel-driven water-electrolysis system. 
Apart from the alkaline electrocatalytic HER and OER activities, we also tested the HER performance of this CoP NS/CC electrode in an acid. Fig. 6a shows the HER LSV curves of CoP NS/CC and bare CC in 0.5 M H2SO4. As expected, the CoP NS/CC has excellent acidic HER activity with both a low overpotential of 88.7 mV needed to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 52.7 mV dec−1, comparing favorably with or even outperforming most of the reported superior HER catalysts (Table S5†), demonstrating the native high activity and fast reaction kinetics of this CoP NS/CC for the acidic HER. The multi-step chronopotentiometric curve (Fig. 6b) with current densities from −10 to −100 mA cm−2 (no iR correction) and LSV curves (inset of Fig. 6b) before and after over 5000 s of electrolysis for the CoP NS/CC in 0.5 M H2SO4 indicate the excellent mass/charge transfer as well as robustness of the CoP NS/CC toward the acidic HER. This electrode was also demonstrated to show high mass-normalized HER performance and good long-term working stability in acid (Fig. S8 and S9†). Considering the acid–base bifunctionality and stability of this CoP NS/CC, and the fact that the favourable electrolyte pH values for the HER and OER are always contradictory, we further fabricated a pH-gradient dual-electrolyte cell with this CoP NS/CC acting as both the cathode and anode to reduce the voltage needed for water electrolysis. Fig. S10† illustrates the relationship between the potentials (vs. SHE) of the two electrodes and the pH of the electrolyte in the water-splitting system. Obviously, independent of the pH value of the electrolyte, the potential difference between the anode and the cathode remains at a constant value of 1.23 V, which is the theoretical minimum water-splitting voltage under atmospheric pressure.49 However, it should be noted that by placing the anode and cathode in strong alkaline (pH = 14) and acidic (pH = 0) electrolytes, respectively, the theoretical voltage for water splitting could be minimized down to 0.4 V.49,50

(f and g) Closer view of the electrode surfaces of CoP NS/CC in the solar panel-driven hybrid water-electrolysis system. 
In view of these points, we built an acid|base dual-electrolyte water-splitting device with cathodic and anodic CoP NS/CC working in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively, and a pretreated Nafion film serving as the electrolyte-separating membrane. Fig. 6c shows the comparison of alkaline and acid|base hybrid overall water-electrolysis efficiencies for CoP NS/CC (+, −) and carbon cloth (+, −). The acid|base dual-electrolyte water-splitting system driven by the CoP NS/CC (+, −) just needs a small voltage of 0.90 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2, 0.77 V lower than that for the corresponding single-electrolyte alkaline water-splitting system. Note that the onset-voltage (the voltage at 1 mA cm−2) of this device is about 0.735 V, making it superior to the reported PtRu black (0.74 V),49 Ni2P (0.79 V),50 Co2P–CoP‖NiFe-LDH (0.8 V)51 and Pt‖CoO (0.78 V)52-based acid–base water-splitting ones. The long-term stability test (Fig. 6d) indicates that the cell voltage at 10 mA cm−2 will increase slightly with prolonged working time and could drop back to about 0.90–0.92 V every time the acidic and alkaline electrolytes are replenished, suggesting that there might be the occurrence of electrolyte crossover during the long-term measurement due to the Nafion film, which could not prevent the diffusion of H+ into the base and might slowly dissolve in the alkaline environment. The LSV curves (Fig. S11†) of the acid|base overall water-splitting performances of CoP NS/CC (+, −) recorded before and after nearly 35 h of electrolysis as well as after electrolysis in new acid/base solutions indicate that electrolyte crossover indeed occurs. Note that the voltage needed to afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2 after replenishing the solutions for the last time (∼22 h) shows only 20 mV decay compared with the initial one, consistent with the result in the long-term alkaline overall water splitting test, demonstrating that this part of voltage decay could be mainly attributed to the minor performance degradation or active phase shedding of CoP NS/CC.
Here, substituting the Nafion membrane with Li-ion exchange52 or bipolar50 membranes, as well as developing more robust and more efficient catalysts could be effective strategies to achieve more stable and energy-saving acid|base water splitting systems. It is worth emphasizing that the bipolar and Li-ion exchange membranes are still not easily accessible due to their high price or immature preparation process. Besides, we also tried to utilize a 2.0 V solar panel to power this dual-electrolyte water splitting device under irradiation with a simulation light source (Fig. 6e and Movie S3†). The generated H2/O2 bubbles on the surface of both electrodes could be well observed at a voltage of ∼0.9 V (Fig. 6f and Movie S4†), indicative of the high feasibility of using solar energy to drive this CoP NS/CC (+, −) pair-based acid|base dual-electrolyte overall water-splitting device.
Apart from the electrochemical performance evaluation, we also performed physical characterization including SEM, XRD, EDX and XPS analyses of this CoP NS/CC after long-term working in the above acid|base hybrid water-electrolysis system to study its structural stability. The SEM images of both the cathode and anode after electrolysis (Fig. S12†) indicate that the CoP NS/CC could well sustain its nanoarray morphology with some small nanoparticles generated on the surface of CoP nanosheets being ascribed to the derived CoOOH phase after the OER.53 The XRD data (Fig. S13†) demonstrate that the CoP nature is retained after acidic and alkaline HER tests, while an amorphous structure might be derived after the alkaline OER test. The EDX results (Fig. S14†) show that the ratios of Co:P in CoP NS/CC after acidic and alkaline HER tests have no apparent changes compared to the initial one, while the P content in the sample has an obvious decrease after the OER test. Further XPS analyses (Fig. S15†) show that after the acidic HER, both the Co 2p and P 2p XPS spectra are similar to the initial ones, and after alkaline OER, the peaks located at ∼780 and ∼795 eV together with the weakened shoulders in the Co 2p region could be attributed to Co3+, indicative of an almost total transformation of the original Co2+ to a higher oxidation state (CoOOH phase) during the anodic OER process.54–56 Meanwhile, the P 2p XPS spectrum of CoP NS/CC after the OER only shows a broad peak located at ∼133.3 eV, which could be ascribed to the oxidized P species.54–56
In summary, we demonstrated here that a phosphidation conversion could well resolve the issues of sacrifice of intrinsic molecular metal active sites and decrease of the native catalytic activity of ZIF-67 after annealing, and further endow the ZIF-67 derived cobalt oxides with acid–base bifunctionality and stability. Both the introduction of phosphorus into the Co3O4 phase and nanosheet array structure endow the CoP NS/CC with improved charge-transfer kinetics and increased catalytically active sites, as well as facilitating electrolyte penetration and O2 diffusion for water splitting. To be specific, in 1.0 M KOH (single electrolyte), the CoP NS/CC exhibits a good overall water-splitting performance with a low cell voltage of just 1.67 V required to afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Meanwhile, this catalyst was also proven to be able to support a novel acid|base dual-electrolyte overall water-splitting system, with low cell voltages of 0.735 V (onset voltage) and 0.9 V needed to attain current densities of 1 and 10 mA cm−2, respectively, surpassing almost all reported water-splitting devices of this kind. This work not only enriches the MOF-derived bifunctional catalysts for alkaline water splitting, but also opens new avenues in utilizing transition-metal phosphide nanoarrays for pH-gradient hybrid water electrolysis to produce H2 with low external bias and thereby minimum energy consumption.
