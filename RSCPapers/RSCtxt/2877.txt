    , Accepted 20th March 2019First published on 22nd March 2019AbstractFundamental properties of organic molecules such as symmetry and conjugation have a major impact on their functional properties and applications. In this study, we designed and synthesized hydrophobic, electrically conductive porphyrin derivatives using N-octyl phenothiazine as the donors and a porphyrin as the π-spacer in a D–π–D configuration. These materials are candidates for hole transport layers (HTL) within optoelectronic devices, and specifically perovskite solar cells (PSC). Detailed optical, electrical and electrochemical characterization of the porphyrin molecules were used to assess their properties, revealing good conductivity, clear electronic transitions and HOMO energy levels well aligned with the valence band of methylammonium lead iodide, the archetypal absorber in PSCs. We fabricated all-solution processed perovskite devices through screen-printing of the various layers and, adopting a carbon nanoparticle–graphene composite cathode, achieved a high photocurrent density of >19.5 mA cm−2 and power conversion efficiency of >11% for our porphyrin derivatives. In addition, by the introduction of hydrophobic octyl groups on the porphyrin substituents, we could achieve excellent water stability of our devices without the need for encapsulation, confirming the promise of these materials for stable HTLs. Such hydrophobic porphyrin systems will have broad academic and industrial interest for use in photovoltaics, light emitting diodes, photodetectors and other optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Organometallic-trihalide perovskites have recently emerged as light-harvesting materials for photovoltaics. Within a short period of time, perovskites have reached a power conversion efficiency from 3 to above 10% without a hole-extraction layer.1 However, the metal electrode layer, which is usually deposited using thermal evaporation, can diffuse into the perovskite and reach the electron transport layer (TiO2), causing a reduction in the overall device performance.2–4 Hence, to protect the perovskite layer from moisture and to avoid direct contact with the metal electrode, Grätzel and co-workers developed a hole transport layer (HTL) between the perovskite and metal electrode layer, mimicking the architecture of dye-sensitized solar cells. After deposition of N2,N2,N2′,N2′,N7,N7,N7′,N7′-octakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetramine (spiro-OMeTAD), efficient hole-extraction from the light-active material is achieved. This results in marginal electron recombination at the interface and improved device performance – allowing the power conversion efficiency to jump from 10 to above 20%.5 Due to this high power conversion efficiency, perovskite materials have been extensively studied in recent years due to their broad light-absorption, tunable band-gap, ambipolar charge transport, high charge carrier mobility and ease of fabrication on arbitrary substrates. Therefore, perovskites are considered a promising alternative to commercial photovoltaic devices.6,7 However, it is a challenging task to utilize these devices for practical application because of some issues, including the toxicity of lead, the poor stability of the perovskite phase and also the cost of spiro-OMeTAD based HTLs. Focusing on the HTL, the synthesis of spiro-OMeTAD on the gram scale is very difficult and therefore this material increases the cost of the device. Many research groups worldwide have been developing new organic molecule (FDT, SDF-OMeTAD) based layers with similar properties to spiro-OMeTAD to be used as HTLs, achieving similar efficiency in perovskite-based devices.8,9 However, these HTLs still face problems of stability and cost. Due to the stability issue of PSCs, a few groups started to use inorganic materials as HTLs, including CuSCN,10 NiO,11 and CuI/Cu.12 With these materials, the device shows lower efficiency than organic HTLs, but the stability is improved significantly. Therefore, even if the high efficiency of perovskite solar cells is appealing, they still suffer from poor stability and the cost of the HTLs, which may impede their commercialization.13
Generally, porphyrin sensitizers in the form of donor–π–acceptor systems as light-harvesting materials in dye-sensitized solar cells have improved the device efficiency from 10.5 to 13%,14–16 but these devices still face the problem of electrolyte leakage and are difficult to scale-up. Donor–π–acceptor porphyrin systems have good band alignment with perovskites and also have higher thermal stability and favourable electrical properties compared to organic molecule based HTLs. But, donor–π–acceptor porphyrin systems adopted as HTLs for perovskite solar cells have led to device efficiencies of 7%.17 However, donor–π–acceptor porphyrin systems were modified to donor–π–donor porphyrin systems to increase π–π molecular stacking, and to tune their HOMO level so that it is appropriately positioned with the valence band of perovskite absorbers and the work-function of cathode materials. Recently, X. Zhu's group and H. K. Kim and co-workers applied donor–π–donor porphyrin systems as HTM layers in perovskite solar cells; the performance of devices reached 12.6% (SGT-061) and 17.7% (ZnP), respectively. In these reports, all layers of solar cells were deposited via the spin coating process18–20 and the high performance was achieved by the addition of the additives; but the devices faced stability issues under ambient conditions. Based on above strategies, we have designed phenothiazine–porphyrin functionalized with alkyl chains, namely 3,3′-((10,20-bis(2,6-bis(octyloxy)phenyl)porphyrin-5,15-diyl)bis(ethyne-2,1-diyl))bis(10-octyl-10H-phenothiazine) [HPPHT], and 3,3′-((10,20-bis(2,6-bis(octyloxy)phenyl)porphyrin-5,15-diyl)bis(ethyne-2,1-diyl))bis(10-octyl-10H-phenothiazine)-Zn(II) [ZPPHT], and used them as HTLs in perovskite solar cells. The perovskite solar cells were fabricated by non-vacuum process (screen printing), and the screen-printing technique offers to print large area and trivialize the materials wastages.21 It was found that HPPHT has a lower conductivity and water contact angle in comparison with ZPPHT, due to the presence of free amines. Screen-printed ZPPHT based perovskite solar cells with a carbon nanoparticle–graphene composite as a cathode exhibited a high-power conversion efficiency of 11.26% under 1 sun conditions, compared with a power conversion efficiency of 9.47% for HPPHT and 8.84% for devices without HTLs. From steady-state photoluminescence and photovoltage measurements, we conclude that (i) the lower HOMO level of ZPPHT compared to HPPHT offers a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc); and (ii) the higher conductivity of ZPPHT resulted in faster charge-extraction in the device. The ZPPHT based solar cells have good long-term stability due to its more hydrophobic nature, and the cells retained their initial efficiencies even after storage in ambient conditions without encapsulation. Henceforth, from the above experimental results and observations, screen-printed ZPPHT materials have been proven to be a successful alternative to spiro-OMeTAD. The hydrophobic ZPPHT materials are also promising for preparing hole conducting layers for a variety of other applications including photodetectors and LEDs.
Result and discussion
Previously, numerous organic moieties including azulenes,22 carbazoles,23 fluorene,24 phenothiazine,25 squaraines,26 tetrathiafulvalenes27 and triphenylamine28 have been used as the sensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells. Among these moieties, phenothiazines are commercially available and possess an easily tunable structure to function as the sensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells.25 Phenothiazine based organic solar cells have exhibited efficiencies of around 9.8%.29 Recently, our group has used phenothiazine as a donor in porphyrin-based dye-sensitized solar cells, achieving device efficiencies of around 10.5%.15 However, phenothiazine and its derivatives used as a hole-extracting layer in perovskite solar cells have reached more than 19% efficiency.30 As such, here we have designed and optimized phenothiazine–porphyrin–phenothiazine (D–π–D) molecular systems (Fig. S1, ESI†), and used DFT analysis to calculate their HOMO/LUMO levels along with the electron density distribution. Fig. 1(a) shows the continuous electron density distribution along the D–π–D molecular systems. The HOMO position is very suitable to extract holes from perovskite absorbers. Following these promising results, we synthesized D–π–D molecular systems with zinc metal (ZPPHT) and without metal (HPPHT) using low-cost starting materials via simple condensation and coupling reactions, as shown in Fig. 1(b). After completion of all the synthetic steps, we successfully obtained the desired molecules, as confirmed using 1H NMR, MALDI-TOF, and FTIR (see Fig. S2–S5, ESI†). The optical absorption and emission spectra of these molecules both in solution (toluene) and as thin films are presented in Fig. 1(c) and (d). Both ZPPHT and HPPHT exhibit bathochromic absorption shifts between the solution and thin film due to the inter molecular interactions and tendency to form J-type aggregates in film states (absorption onsets at 682 nm for solution, 750 nm for film for ZPPHT; absorption onsets at 725 nm for solution, 744 nm for film for HPPHT).31 Emission spectra were collected at RT in toluene by exciting at 464 nm and both materials show intense photoluminescence. ZPPHT shows a more intense vibrational shoulder and HPPHT exhibits an intense peak in the solution state at the higher wavelength. Both thin films exhibit less intense, single peak emission at lower energies. These results suggest J-type aggregation and π–π stacking in both the D–π–D molecular systems in the films.31

UV-vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy were adopted to investigate the molecular aggregation of these newly designed D–π–D porphyrin molecular systems in toluene solvent (Fig. S6(a), ESI†). When the temperature is varied from 30 to 80 °C, the intensity of the photoluminescence spectra is slightly decreased and red-shifted (Fig. 2(a) and circles with down arrows) due to the thermal deactivation of the excited state and/or molecule to molecule aggregation (excitation wavelength of HPPHT and ZPPHT at 464 nm).32 In this case, our molecular systems are active under ambient light and temperature conditions. With the aggregation, there is a possibility to enhance π–π stacking, which results in a quenched singlet excited state life-time. We recorded the singlet excited state life-time of these molecular systems using time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and fitted with a mono-exponential decay. Here, we noticed that by the substitution of Zn metal into the HPPHT molecular system and with temperature, the time-resolved PL decay is decreased from 6.2 ns to 1.8 ns, due to the occurrence of charge trap states and relaxation in the molecular system. Finally, the metal-based porphyrin system (ZPPHT) has a shorter average lifetime compared to the metal-free porphyrin system (HPPHT), probably due to a greater triplet quantum yield by intersystem crossing. The dissolved molecules in toluene could be deposited on a patterned FTO glass substrate and the electrical properties of the films were measured at different temperatures. Increasing the temperature of solutions commonly causes molecules to aggregate,33 whereas in thin films molecular stacking occurs. Molecular stacking helps to obtain a uniform surface morphology, which increases the conductivity of films. The electrical properties of MAPbI3, HPPHT and ZPPHT films were qualitatively analyzed using two-probe measurements. The results (Fig. 2(c)) indicate that the conductivity of HPPHT only marginally improved compared with the MAPbI3 film (Fig. S6(b), ESI†) and was much lower than that of the ZPPHT film measured under similar experimental conditions (inset in Fig. 2(c): digital-photographs and electrical property schematic diagram).34 From these observations we can conclude that HPPHT and ZPPHT molecules are suitable for hole-extraction in perovskite solar cells. We analyzed the optical properties of our MAPbI3 films before and after depositing the porphyrin-based HTLs, and the results are shown in Fig. S6(c) (ESI†) and Fig. 2(d). Fig. 2(d) shows the emission spectra of before and after deposition D–π–D porphyrin molecular systems on perovskite layer.35 After deposition of D–π–D porphyrin molecular systems on perovskite, the PL intensity was reduced; due to the efficient charge transportation at the interface. Also, we recorded the optical absorption for these electrodes and the onset absorption enhanced up to the 900 nm region due to optical band gap quenching (Fig. S6(c), ESI†). We also investigated the hole-transfer ability at the interface of MAPbI3/TiO2 and porphyrin/MAPbI3/TiO2 layers using emission spectra. The MAPbI3/TiO2 sample shows strong photoluminescence emission as expected. The deposition of the porphyrin (ZPPHT and HPPHT) materials on the MAPbI3 layer drastically quenches the emission due to efficient hole-extraction from the perovskite layer, therefore inhibiting recombination.36 To support these results, we carried out differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements37 to measure the oxidation potentials of HPPHT and ZPPHT, which show that ZPPHT has a lower oxidation potential value than HPPHT (Fig. S7, ESI†), therefore providing a larger driving force for hole-transfer from MAPbI3 to the porphyrin layer. We can conclude that ZPPHT materials have a suitable HOMO level for perovskites, and it is expected they will contribute in increasing the open circuit voltage of devices.35 The device performance of these materials will be discussed later in Fig. 5.

The morphology of our samples was analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the images are presented in Fig. 3. The perovskite layer shows tightly packed cuboid-shaped crystals which are 150–400 nm in size. The thickness of the layer is around 200 nm (Fig. 3(a) and (d)). This morphology is markedly different compared to the PbI2 layer before the reaction with methylammonium iodide (MAI) (see Fig. S8(a), ESI†). As discussed earlier, porphyrin hole-extracting materials were deposited on the MAPbI3 layer by screen printing, and SEM images show their smooth surface with a thickness of around 40 nm. We believe that the porphyrin materials fill the pores between the grains of MAPbI3, therefore acting as a barrier offering protection from moisture (see below). The D–π–D porphyrin molecular systems are hydrophobic in nature, due to the presence of long alkyl chains, which are also useful for increasing the solubility, film formation, hydrophobicity and π–π stacking. The SEM image of the complete device with a carbon nanoparticle–graphene composite (as the cathode layer) is shown in Fig. 3(c) and (f). The carbon nanoparticle–graphene composite layer has been deposited by screen printing as well and it has a smooth morphology with a layer thickness of around 10 μm (Fig. S8(b), ESI†). We tested all of our layers for their hydrophobic properties using water contact angle measurements (Fig. 3(a)–(c)). The MAPbI3 film exhibited the smallest water contact angle of around 27.9° (Fig. 3(a)), revealing the affinity to water of MAI and its hygroscopic properties under ambient conditions. To protect the MAPbI3 layer, here we have used the hydrophobic nature of the alkyl chain of our porphyrin molecular systems. The D–π–D porphyrins (HPPHT, ZPPHT) and the cathode layer showed higher water contact angles of around 91.3°, 114.2° and 116.7° respectively (see also Fig. S8(c), ESI†). Therefore, it is believed that these layers can efficiently protect the MAPbI3 layer from moisture and increase the durability of the devices.

The majority of lab-scale perovskite solar cells are deposited using spin-coating, except for the top electrode which is deposited by thermal evaporation. Spin-coating is simple, fast and produces reasonably uniform layers, however it has a limitation in the substrate dimensions.21,36 Therefore, here we have fabricated perovskite solar cells using a screen-printing process, both on the laboratory scale (0.16 cm2) and as a mini-module (64 cm2). After deposition, each layer was dried and annealed at the required temperature and the procedure was repeated for the subsequent layer. The digital photographs of the different layers (active area 64 cm2) are shown in Fig. 4(a)–(d); 0.16 cm2 area devices are not shown here, because large-area electrodes are more interesting visually than small. With the deposition of the porphyrin hole-extracting layer on MAPbI3, the reddish-brown colour changed to dark-green. These devices were immersed into water for up to 120 hours (see also Video S1, ESI†) to assess the water stability of our porphyrin-coated perovskite. The ZPPHT based devices are highly stable both in water and under ambient conditions (Fig. 4(e)–(h)) when compared to the MAPbI3 and HPPHT based solar cells. In addition to this, we recorded the absorption spectra of the water before and after the immersion of the devices for different durations of time (Fig. S9, ESI†). MAPbI3 is known to react with water, decomposing into PbI2. The absorption spectra of the ZPPHT based solar cells didn't show any peak for PbI2, MAI or the porphyrin; but MAPbI3 and HPPHT show the corresponding PbI2 peak. The absorption spectrum of the ZPPHT based solar cell reveals a greater stability in water under ambient conditions compared with HPPHT and MAPbI3. When covered with HPPHT, MAPbI3 is still unstable due to the presence of a free amine in HPPHT (indicated with a circle in Fig. S1, ESI†), and their relative hydrophobicity.38 In the case of symmetric ZPPHT, the absence of basic functional groups and the more hydrophobic nature of the molecule (see Fig. 3) enable protection of the underlying perovskite from moisture. Therefore, ZPPHT materials provide suitable hole extraction properties, and high-water stability, compared to HPPHT and spiro-OMeTAD. The preparation of ZPPHT/HPPHT and the overall yield and cost is described in the ESI† (Table S7.1–S7.5).

After analysis of the microstructural, electrical and optical properties of the D–π–D porphyrin molecular system, it was applied as a hole-extraction layer in perovskite solar cells. Here, we fabricated regular meso-perovskite solar cells both with/without a dopant free-hole-extraction layer and measured their performance under ambient conditions (30 °C RT, 65–75% RH, Hyderabad, India; 100 mW cm−2, air mass 1.5G) as shown in Fig. 5(a). Perovskite solar cells using ZPPHT as the HTL exhibited a higher photo-current density (Jsc) of 19.66 mA cm−2 and open-circuit-voltage (Voc) of 1.000 V compared to the solar cells using HPPHT as the HTL (16.59 mA cm−2, 0.954 V). Furthermore, the HTL-free devices showed lower performance (15.88 mA cm−2, 0.932 V). The detailed device parameters are listed in Table 1. HPPHT films, as well as pure MAPbI3, have low conductivity (Fig. S6(b), ESI† and Fig. 2(c)), resulting in devices with a higher series resistance (Rs). The Rs affects the charge transport and junction properties of the device.34 The open circuit voltage (Voc) of device, majorly depends on energy loss at the interface of perovskite/hole-extraction materials in device. The ZPPHT based solar cell have higher Voc, due to the lower energy loss at interface and faster charge extraction and transportation from the active materials.39 Additionally, we observed specific changes in the dark-current characteristics of these devices as shown in Fig. 5(b). The dark current onset of the MAPbI3/carbon device occurred at a forward bias voltage (VFWB) of 945 mV and the device exhibited a dark current density of −4.1 mA cm−2. After deposition of the HPPHT HTL in between the MAPbI3 and carbon nanoparticle–graphene composite, the dark-current density is decreased from −4.1 to −1.01 mA cm−2 at the onset potential.40 The ZPPHT based PSC exhibits a similar onset potential to MAPbI3 and HPPHT; however, the magnitude of the dark current increased from −1.01 to −2.5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5(b)). The dark-current density is directly dependent on the interface and electrical properties of the hole-extraction materials. We assessed the charge carrier transport and recombination within our devices using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 5(c) shows the Nyquist plot of all-ambient-processed PSCs measured in the dark at open-circuit voltage bias. We can recognize two RC components for all samples. The component in the high-frequency range is assigned to charge transport and recombination in perovskite/hole-extraction layers while the one in the low-frequency range represents the perovskite/TiO2 interface. The Nyquist plots are fitted using the equivalent circuit and the estimated Rs values are provided in Table 1. The low Rs of 15.28 Ohm cm−2 obtained for the ZPPHT based PSC indicates relatively better carrier transport, which is responsible for the high-power conversion efficiency compared to the HPPHT (28.23 Ohm cm−2) and HTL-free (36.91 Ohm cm−2) devices. Furthermore, we assessed the long-term stability of our solar cells. The devices were kept under ambient conditions and measurements were carried out at regular intervals over time. Fig. 5(d) compares the normalized power conversion efficiencies of PSCs with and without hole-extracting materials. The HTL-free devices show a drastic decrease in efficiency over time, and the devices using HPPHT as a HTL show only a negligible improvement. However, a notable improvement was observed in devices using ZPPHT as a HTL, with a performance loss of only 20% after 120 hours of exposure. These observations are consistent with the contact angle measurements reported earlier. It is worth mentioning that we fabricated conventional perovskite solar cells using the carbon–graphene composite as the cathode layer and dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL. The devices exhibit lower performance (5.91%)41 compared to all our devices under our experimental conditions. To further strengthen our work, we measured the electrical properties of dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD using the two-probe I–V characteristics. The results (shown as Fig. S10 in the ESI†) indicate that the dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD film has much lower electrical properties than the ZPPHT and HPPHT films. Then, we tested the reproducibility in the performance and stability using these materials; the devices had approximately similar performance. All the mentioned device performance values are the average of 8 devices. We have also fabricated mini-module by adopting similar procedure of test cell device and the corresponding device characteristics and parameters are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). Increasing the active area of the device, the efficiency diminished, due to the charge carrier recombination. At present, we are working on boosting the performance of the mini-module and other activities.

Conclusions
In this work, we have designed and synthesized D–π–D porphyrin hole-extraction materials with and without a metal center (ZPPHT and HPPHT) using a high yield solution-based approach. The introduction of Zn into the D–π–D porphyrin molecular system improves the planarity and hydrophobicity of the molecule. A detailed comparison of the electrochemical and electrical properties of ZPPHT and HPPHT revealed that ZPPHT has a lower HOMO energy level and higher conductivity. Perovskite solar cells fabricated by screen printing and employing ZPPHT as a HTL achieved over 11% efficiency under 100 mW cm−2, which is the highest reported efficiency so far with the combination of a D–π–D porphyrin hole-extraction layer and a carbon–graphene composite as a cathode. These solar cells exhibited a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) due to the rapid hole-extraction at the interface of MAPbI3 and ZPPHT, which has been confirmed by photoluminescence quenching. The ZPPHT devices are also more stable under ambient conditions than HTL-free devices and devices using HPPHT or spiro-OMeTAD as a HTL. Therefore, we can conclude that hydrophobic, electrically conductive D–π–D porphyrin molecular systems are very effective as hole transport materials and may be useful for optoelectronic applications including photovoltaics and LEDs.

Synthesis of 3,3′-((10,20-bis(2,6-bis(octyloxy)phenyl)porphyrin-5,15-diyl)bis(ethyne-2,1-diyl))bis(10-octyl-10H-phenothiazine)-Zn(II) (ZPPHT). 
Under a N2 atmosphere Por-Br2 (1.00 g, 0.84 mmol) was dissolved in 10 ml triethylamine (TEA) and 10 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) in a 50 ml RBF. The resulting solution was purged with N2 gas for about 20 min followed by addition of CuI (0.023 g), and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4) (0.14 g) which were heated to 50–60 °C. Next, 3-ethyl-10-octyl-10H-phenothiazine (C8-Ptz-E (0.84 g, 2.51 mmol)) was dissolved in 5 ml THF and added slowly with the help of a syringe, and a spontaneous colour change (brown to green) was observed. We monitored the TLC until the starting materials were consumed. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled down to RT and the solvent was removed through rotary evaporation. Then the material was dissolved in DCM, filtered and dried over Na2SO4. Furthermore, the reaction mixture was purified by column chromatography using hexane:DCM (3:1 v/v) and recrystallized with methanol/DCM; yield 89% as a green powder.

We synthesized the free-base porphyrin from ZPPHT by demetallation. 0.5 g (0.30 mmol) of ZPPHT was dissolved in 25 ml of DCM, aqueous 0.01 M HCl was added dropwise and the TLC monitored until the reaction completed. Then, after quenching with water, the material was dried through rotary evaporation and recrystallized with methanol and dichloromethane to get the title compound as a dark green power in 92% yield.
