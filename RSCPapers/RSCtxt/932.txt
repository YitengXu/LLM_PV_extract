    , Accepted 15th September 2020First published on 16th September 2020AbstractAs a rising star of transition metal oxides (TMOs), cuprous oxide (Cu2O) has a relatively narrow direct bandgap and features strong light–matter interaction, large optical absorption, large minority carrier diffusion lengths and high exciton binding energy, indicating its broad prospects in the field of photonics and optoelectronics. Herein, novel uniform Cu2O nanocubes are successfully prepared by liquid-phase reduction. However, the nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of Cu2O nanocubes and their applications in ultrafast photonics are rarely explored. The modulation depth (12.2%) and saturation intensity (65.8 MW cm−2) of Cu2O nanocubes are demonstrated experimentally, which indicates the excellent potential of Cu2O nanocubes in photonics among the emerging novel NLO materials. Meanwhile, the surface morphology, photoluminescence (PL) characteristics and chemical composition of Cu2O nanocubes have been systematically investigated. More importantly, a high repetition rate (HRR) of a ≈1 GHz ultrashort pulse laser with a 682 fs pulse width is obtained based on the Cu2O nanocubes as a saturable absorber (SA) in the telecommunications band for the first time. Considering the outstanding NLO properties and relatively narrow direct bandgap, these studies pave the way towards advanced photonics based on the Cu2O nanocube material.
1. Introduction
Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are widely used in all-optical switches, optical limiters, optical memory, optical frequency, photodetector and optical modulators due to their excellent optical, electrical and optoelectronic properties.1–3 Therefore, the design and preparation of NLO materials with large nonlinear coefficients, fast NLO response and great practical value are of great significance for the development of new photoelectric functional devices. Since some scientists first reported that transition metal oxides (TMOs) can be used as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries in 2000, TMOs have attracted a lot of attention. When the size of TMOs is reduced to the nanoscale level, they show unique properties and new laws,4–6 which are different from bulk materials in terms of the following four effects, namely, the surface effect, small size effect, quantum size effect and macro quantum tunneling effect. In addition, as a member of NLO materials, TMOs have aroused great interest due to their high potental capacity, various phase structures, high optical sensitivity, high electron mobility, large absorption coefficient, high corrosion resistance, wide potential window and rich characteristics of redox centers.6,7 Especially in recent years, materials such as TiO2, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, MnO2, have been widely used as saturable absorbers (SAs) to realize ultrashort pulses due to their amazing NLO properties.7,8 In addition, Sun et al.9 realized a pulsed visible laser at a wavelength of 640.3 nm based on NiO nanosheets as a SA. Therefore, it is of great significance to study TMOs, especially as SAs to realize ultrashort pulses. At the same time, some nanomaterials with fascinating NLO properties such as black phosphorus (BP), MXenes, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), graphdiyne (GD), topological insulators (TIs), halide perovskites, metal phosphorus trichalcogenide (MPT3), metal organic frameworks (MOFs), heterojunctions and metal oxides (MOs) have been widely studied as SAs.10–13 However, these nanomaterials also have some disadvantages. For example, TIs have a complex preparation process since they are made up of two different elements. In addition, BP and halide perovskites are relatively unstable in air.14 Based on the above analysis, TMOs have some unique characteristics that other nanomaterials can’t replace, so it is particularly important to further study TMOs.
As a member of novel inorganic semiconductor TMOs, Cu2O has aroused great interest due to its photoelectric conversion efficiency, which can be up to 23%, high theoretical H2 conversion efficiency of 18% for water splitting, high hole mobility (μ ∼100 cm2 V−1 s−1), large refractive index (2.705), larger minority carrier diffusion length (Lp ∼1–2 μm), large light absorption coefficient (α ∼106 cm−1) and higher exciton binding energy (140 meV).15–17 Cu2O belongs to the cubic system of the chalcopyrite structure. The crystal structure of Cu2O is different from that of general MOs.18,19 It is composed of two Cu2O networks penetrating each other. This special structure makes it show great photoelectric properties. Cu2O has a relatively narrow bandgap of 1.9–2.2 eV. Cu2O is generally a red or orange yellow powder, and its color varies with the preparation method and grain size of Cu2O, which can be expressed as yellow, orange, red or purple and other colors.20–23 So far, Cu2O with different nanostructures, such as cubes, octahedra, nanowire arrays, nanospheres, nanoflowers and nanoparticles, has been successfully prepared.23 Spherical Cu2O nanoparticles are more favorable to release in seawater, but they are prone to the “burst” phenomenon.24–26 Cubic Cu2O nanoparticles release gently and evenly in seawater. At present, Cu2O has been prepared by solid phase, electrolytic, solvothermal, sonochemical, electrochemical, hydrothermal, liquid phase reduction and sol–gel methods.27 Liu et al.28 synthesized a graphene/Cu2O composite quantum dot photodetector with ultra-high response. Yang et al.29 prepared Cu2O–Ag nanocomposites with enhanced durability and bactericidal activity. Yue et al.30 prepared Cu2O/Cu2S nanocomposites with different molar ratios by a simple precipitation–calcination method. Cu2O has been widely used in solar cells, biosensors, supercapacitors, water splitting, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices, photo-catalysts, transparent thin film transistors (TFTs), medicine, electrocatalysis, photodetectors, lithium-ion electrode materials and gas sensors because of its outstanding optical, electrical and optoelectronic properties.31 Moreover, Cu2O is a typical direct bandgap p-type semiconductor material, which has a remarkable nonlinear optical effect, super-fast time response and large third-order nonlinear polarizability.32 It has attracted great attention and is an excellent candidate material for all-optical switching and cross phase modulation.33–35 Although some progress has been made in theoretical and experimental research, the experimental study of ultrafast photonics of Cu2O has not been touched. Based on the above analysis, it is very meaningful and interesting to prepare a Cu2O SA with excellent performance and apply it to ultrafast photonics to realize ultrashort pulses.36–47
In this work, two uniform different size Cu2O nanocubes are synthesized by liquid-phase reduction. The surface morphology, crystallinity, optical properties, lattice fringes, bandgap, selected area electron diffraction (SAED), purity and fluorescence properties of the two uniform different size Cu2O nanocubes are studied by SEM, XRD, UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy, TEM, ac-STEM, XPS, PL spectroscopy, TRPL spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. We found that the prepared Cu2O nanocubes have uniform particle dispersion, high crystallinity, a uniform size, a relatively narrow bandgap, high purity and outstanding optical properties. Furthermore, the nonlinear optical properties of these large-scale Cu2O nanocubes are measured using a double balance detection system, and it is found that their saturation intensity and modulation depth are 65.8 MW cm−2 and 12.2%, respectively. The Cu2O SA is prepared by the optical deposition method. Moreover, we integrate the Cu2O SA into a fiber laser to realize 251st harmonic mode-locking. Harmonic mode-locking with a repetition rate of 0.98 GHz, pulse width of 682 fs and spectral width of 4.5 nm is realized at a central wavelength of 1556.8 nm.
2. Preparation and characterization
The atomic structure of Cu2O is shown in Fig. 1a, which is the atomic arrangement of the (100), (110), and (111) crystal planes. In this paper, Cu2O nanocubes were prepared by a liquid phase reduction method. Fig. 1b shows the preparation process of the Cu2O nanocubes. First, 0.2 g of copper sulfate pentahydrate (Cu2SO4·5H2O) was weighed and added to 8 mL deionized water, and 1.78 mL polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400) was added to 30 mL deionized water. The two solutions were then mixed and transferred to a double-necked flask, and the mixture was stirred on a magnetic stirrer while purging under a N2 environment for 10 min. 1.2 g sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was added to 26 ml of deionized water and mixed uniformly, and marked as solution A. At the same time, 0.352 g of ascorbic acid was added to 22 ml of deionized water and dispersed uniformly, and marked as solution B. Solution A and solution B were each purged under a N2 atmosphere for 5 min. Second, solution A was evenly added to the double-necked flask and stirred for 2 minutes to form a blue Cu (OH)2 precipitate. Third, solution B was evenly added to the double-necked flask and stirred for 40 minutes to reduce to form an orange-colored Cu2O suspension. Finally, the resulting precipitated product was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water several times to remove impurities, and then the product was placed in a vacuum drying box and dried at 60 °C for 8 hours to obtain Cu2O powder as shown in the sample picture in Fig. 1b.

By changing the concentration of the surfactant PEG400 (0.89 mL), Cu2O nanocubes of different sizes were prepared for comparison experiments. SEM images of large size Cu2O nanocubes obtained by a typical preparation method are shown in Fig. 1c–e. Uniform large size Cu2O nanocubes can be observed from the figures, and the particle size statistics of the illustration in Fig. 1e can be obtained. The average particle diameter of the particles is 249.69 nm. Fig. 1f–h show SEM images of small size Cu2O nanocubes prepared by changing the surfactant concentration. From the figures, it is observed that uniform Cu2O nanocubes can also be obtained, and the particle size is relatively smaller but the uniformity of the particles is reduced. The inset particle size statistics in Fig. 1h support this result. The average particle size is 182.70 nm. The two samples are marked according to the different sizes, corresponding to large size Cu2O nanocubes and small size Cu2O nanocubes. The XRD pattern of the Cu2O nanocubes is shown in Fig. 1i. According to the analysis of Jade 6.5 software, the peaks at 2θ = 29.57°, 36.42°, 42.31°, 61.37°, 69.58°, 73.52° and 77.37° correspond to the Cu2O nanocube (110), (111), (200), (220), (310), (311) and (222) crystal planes. Consistent with the cubic Cu2O system of the PDF 99-0041 card, it is indicated that high-purity Cu2O nanocubes are successfully obtained. The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrum is shown in Fig. 1j. The results show that the two Cu2O materials both have strong absorption in the ultraviolet region (200–400 nm), and the NIR wavelengths at 1556.8 nm also have relatively strong absorption. This indicates that Cu2O has the potential to be used as a SA in an erbium-doped fiber (EDF) laser for the generation of ultrashort pulses. In Fig. 1k, the bandgap diagram of Cu2O nanocubes is obtained by fitting according to the K–M formula. The large size Cu2O nanocube bandgap is 1.9 eV and the small size Cu2O nanocube bandgap is 2.1 eV. This also confirms the potential application of the large size Cu2O nanocubes in ultrafast photonics.
To further explore the structural characteristics of the Cu2O nanocubes, Fig. 2a reveals the ac-STEM image of the large size Cu2O nanocubes. Fig. 2b–d show the element mapping of the large size Cu2O nanocubes in a large angle ring dark field. The results show that only Cu and O exist in this material. The Cu and O elements are present in the EDS spectrum shown in Fig. 2e. We can understand that the prepared large size Cu2O nanocubes have high purity, high quality, and good crystallinity. As shown in Fig. 2g, a linear scan is obtained from Fig. 2f. It can also be observed that the Cu and O elements are uniformly distributed on the surface. It is proved that uniform and dense large size Cu2O nanocubes are prepared. Fig. 2h shows the low-resolution TEM image of the large size Cu2O nanocubes. Fig. 2i shows the SAED pattern. Therefore, the Cu2O nanocubes have a single crystal structure. From the HRTEM of Fig. 2j, we can see that the lattice spacing on the (200) plane is 0.213 nm. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2j, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the Cu2O lattice shows the expected lattice reflection. Fig. 2k shows the ac-STEM image of the small size Cu2O nanocubes. Fig. 2l and m show the element mapping of the small size Cu2O nanocubes in a large angle ring dark field. The results show that only Cu and O exist in this material. Fig. 2n shows the low-resolution TEM image of the small size Cu2O nanocubes. As shown in Fig. 2o, lattice fringes with a crystal plane spacing of 0.213 nm can be observed. This crystal plane spacing is consistent with the (200) crystal plane spacing of the Cu2O nanocubes. Only the presence of Cu and O elements is observed in the EDS spectrum shown in Fig. 2p. We can understand that the prepared small size Cu2O nanocubes have high purity, high quality, and great crystallinity. As shown in Fig. 2r, a linear scan is obtained from Fig. 2q. It can also be observed that the Cu and O elements are uniformly distributed on the surface.

The chemical composition and chemical valence of the large size Cu2O nanocube material surface are analyzed by XPS as shown in Fig. 3a–d, corrected with C 1s of 284.8 eV. The full spectrum of the sample is shown in Fig. 3a. From the spectrum, the presence of Cu, O, and C elements on the sample surface can be observed. The C 1s, C–O and CO peaks with a binding energy of 284.8 eV, 286.2 eV and 288.7 eV are observed in Fig. 3b. The C 1s state with a binding energy of 284.8 eV observed in Fig. 3b is the characteristic spectrum of XPS. Three peaks of element O at 530.1, 531.1, and 533.4 eV are shown in Fig. 3c. The peak at 531.1 eV is attributed to the lattice oxygen of the Cu2O nanocubes and the peak at 533.4 eV corresponds to the surface adsorbed oxygen. Fig. 3d shows the spectrum of Cu 2p. The double strong peaks at 932.3 and 952.2 eV are mainly attributed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 in the Cu2O nanocubes, which is consistent with previous reports. The relatively low intensity peaks at 934.2 and 954.1 eV are attributed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 in CuO nanomaterials, indicating a small amount of oxidation in the sample. Fig. 3e shows the PL spectra of the Cu2O nanocubes under 600 nm laser excitation, and they show a strong fluorescence emission peak at 700 nm. This shows that the recombination speed of holes and electrons in the Cu2O nanocubes is relatively fast. The TRPL spectrum is shown in Fig. 3f. The fluorescence lifetimes of Cu2O nanocubes with different sizes are 0.34 and 0.31 ns, respectively. The nonlinear experimental device for measuring the Cu2O nanocube SA is shown in Fig. 3g. The experimental device consists of a seed source and an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA). The seed source refers to a self-made fiber laser with a central wavelength of 1560 nm, pulse width of 650 fs and fundamental repetition rate of 27 MHz. Power meter 1 (Pm1) records the output power after the interaction between the pulsed laser and the material, while the other power meter 2 (Pm2) records the output power of the pulsed laser without obstacles. The OC ratio is 50:50. The nonlinear transmission curve of the large size Cu2O nanocubes is shown in Fig. 3h. The saturated light intensity and modulation depth of the large size Cu2O nanocubes are 65.8 MW cm−2 and 12.2%, respectively. The nonlinear transmission curve of the small size Cu2O nanocubes is shown in Fig. 3i. The saturated light intensity and modulation depth of the small size Cu2O nanocubes are 46.7 MW cm−2 and 1.5%, respectively. The Raman spectra of these Cu2O nanocubes are shown in Fig. 3j. The Raman spectrum of the Cu2O nanocubes is measured using a 532 nm laser. The Raman spectra show three characteristic peaks, which are located at 289, 615 and 791 cm−1, respectively. The corresponding vibration modes are A2u, T14 and T12, which are consistent with previously reported literature. Fig. 3k shows the experimental device for the fabrication of a tapered fiber. Fig. 3l is the Cu2O nanocube SA prepared by the optical deposition method. Through an optical microscope device, we observe the tapered fiber with a diameter of 12 μm as shown in Fig. 3m, and we can also see that the Cu2O material is closely attached to the tapered fiber. Fig. 3n is the autocorrelation of the seed source. Fig. 3o indicates that the pulse interval is 35.8 ns.

3. Results and discussion
The schematic diagram of the mode-locked fiber laser based on the Cu2O nanocube SA is shown in Fig. 4a. A laser diode (LD) with a central wavelength of 980 nm is used as a pump source. A wavelength division multiplexer (WDM), a polarization independent isolator (PI-ISO) and an optical coupler (OC) are integrated into one hybrid device, namely a WDM/ISO/OC hybrid device. The function of the WDM/ISO/OC hybrid device is coupling the pump energy into the cavity, ensuring unidirectional transmission of light and ensuring 30% output power for analysis, respectively. In this study, we use this WDM/ISO/OC hybrid device because it can reduce the splicing loss caused by integration of multiple devices into the cavity, which will greatly improve the output power of the fiber laser. A 1.1 m EDF (Er110-4/125, LIEKKI) with an absorption rate of 110 dB m−1 at 1530 nm and a group velocity dispersion value of 0.012 ps2 m−1 is used as a gain medium for the fiber laser. When the SA is placed in the laser cavity, laser light with low intensity will be attenuated. However, because the intensity of the laser without mode locking changes randomly, the randomly generated light intensity will be large enough to transmit through the SA. After many oscillations, a series of light pulses will be generated, and the laser will be mode locked. This Cu2O nanocube material is used as the SA. A polarization controller (PC) is used to adjust the polarization state and intracavity birefringence to realize mode-locking operation. The total cavity length of this mode-locked fiber laser is 49.8 m. The length of the single-mode fiber (SMF) with dispersion parameter 20 ps nm−1 km−1 is 43.2 m. A 1 GHz digital oscilloscope (Rigol DS6104) equipped with a 2 GHz photoelectric detector (Thorlabs DET01 CFC), an optical spectrum analyzer (Anritsu MS9710C) with a resolution of 0.02 nm, a 6 GHz RF spectrum analyzer (Rohde & Schwarz FSC6) and an autocorrelator (FR-103XL) are shown in Fig. 4a, which are used to analyze the pulse train, spectrum, frequency and pulse duration, respectively.

(d) Radio frequency (RF) spectrum of mode-locked pulses with a fundamental repetition frequency of 3.91 MHz. (e) Autocorrelation trace with a sech2 fit, τ = 1.54 × 769 fs. 
When the pump power is 219 mW, we realize traditional soliton mode-locking with a fundamental repetition rate of 3.91 MHz by adjusting the PC to a suitable position. The output power and pulse energy of the mode-locked fiber laser are 2.8 mW and 0.72 nJ, respectively. The mode-locked spectrum with a central wavelength of 1556.8 nm and 3 dB bandwidth of 3.9 nm is shown in Fig. 4b. The Kelly sidebands distributed on the left side of the spectrum show that the mode-locking is the traditional soliton pulse. The traditional soliton is formed by the balance between the nonlinearity and dispersion of the fiber. The Kelly sidebands are caused by the constructive interference between the dispersion wave and the soliton pulse in the resonator. Fig. 4c shows the pulse train with a mode-locked pulse interval of 255.5 ns, from which we can know that the mode-locked state is very stable at this time, indicating that the ultra-short pulse based on the Cu2O nanocube SA has excellent characteristics. It is further indicated that the Cu2O nanocube material used in this study has excellent nonlinear optical properties. As shown in Fig. 4d, the RF spectrum shows that the repetition frequency of the mode-locked pulse is 3.91 MHz, and the corresponding cavity length is 49.8 m. By analyzing the RF spectrum, we can know that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 69 dB, which further shows that the realized ultrashort pulse has outstanding quality and it may be used in some optoelectronic devices. The ultra-short pulse with a pulse duration of 769 fs measured by autocorrelation is shown in Fig. 4e. The time–bandwidth product of this traditional soliton mode-locking is 0.371.
Then, we remain the polarization state of the cavity unchanged. Surprisingly, we achieve different order harmonic mode locking when we only change the pump power. What's more surprising is that when the pump power is 335 mW, we have achieved 251st harmonic mode locking, and its corresponding repetition frequency is 980 MHz. With the increase of the pump power, we have achieved 28, 56, 80 and 119th harmonic mode locking, respectively, which are shown in Fig. 5a–d. We think that the reason for this phenomenon is that pulse splitting becomes more intense with the increase of the pump power. Therefore, with the increase of the pump power, a narrower pulse interval, higher harmonic order and higher repetition frequency will appear. The 251st harmonic mode locking is shown in Fig. 5e–h. The mode-locked spectrum with a central wavelength of 1556.8 nm and 3 dB bandwidth of 4.5 nm is shown in Fig. 5e. Fig. 5f shows the pulse train with a mode-locked pulse interval of 1.02 ns and the corresponding repetition frequency is 980 MHz, from which we can know that the mode-locked state is very stable at this time, indicating that the ultra-short pulse based on the Cu2O nanocube SA has excellent characteristics. As shown in Fig. 5g, the RF spectrum shows that the repetition frequency of the mode-locked pulse is 980 MHz, and the corresponding harmonic order is 251. By analyzing the RF spectrum, we can know that the SNR is 27 dB, which means that the influence of the interaction between the birefringence effect of the fiber and the nonlinear optical effect of the pulse and Cu2O is inevitable. Moreover, it may be the effect of spectral modulation, high-order group velocity dispersion and self-phase modulation on the pulse SNR. The ultra-short pulse with a pulse duration of 682 fs measured by autocorrelation is shown in Fig. 5h. The time–bandwidth product of 251st harmonic mode locking is 0.380, which is close to the transform limited value.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, two uniform different size Cu2O nanocubes are synthesized by liquid-phase reduction. We found that the prepared Cu2O nanocubes have uniform particle dispersion, high crystallinity, a uniform size, a relatively narrow bandgap, high purity and outstanding optical properties. Furthermore, the nonlinear optical properties of the large-scale Cu2O nanocubes are measured using a double balance detection system, and it is found that their saturation intensity and modulation depth are 65.8 MW cm−2 and 12.2%, respectively. A large-scale Cu2O SA is prepared by the optical deposition method. Moreover, we integrate the Cu2O SA into a fiber laser to realize 251st harmonic mode-locking. Harmonic mode-locking with a repetition rate of 0.98 GHz, pulse width of 682 fs and spectral width of 4.5 nm is realized at a central wavelength of 1556.8 nm. Based on the above analysis, this outstanding Cu2O nanocube material has great potential to be used in communications, lasers, medical equipment, and other industries. In a nutshell, the exploration of Cu2O nanocubes is in the ascendant, and the future work will be a systematic study on its nonlinear characteristics and photonics application.
