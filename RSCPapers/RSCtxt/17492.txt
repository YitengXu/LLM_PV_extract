, Accepted 2nd July 2023First published on 3rd July 2023AbstractRecent advancements in “phyco-nanobionics” have sparked considerable interest in the ability of microalgae to synthesize high-value natural bioactive compounds such as carotenoid pigments, which have been highlighted as an emergent and vital bioactive compound from both industrial and scientific perspectives. Such bioactive compounds are often synthesized by either altering the biogenetic processes existing in living microorganisms or using synthetic techniques derived from petroleum-based chemical sources. A bio-hybrid light-driven cell factory system was established herein by using harmful macroalgal bloom extract (HMBE) and efficient light-harvesting silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to synthesize HMBE-AgNPs and integrating the synthesized HMBE-AgNPs in various concentrations (1, 2.5, 5 and 10 ppm) into the microalgae C. sorokiniana UUIND6 to improve the overall solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency in carotenoid pigment synthesis in microalgae. The current study findings found high biocompatibility of 5 ppm HMBE-AgNP concentration that can serve as a built-in photo-sensitizer and significantly improve ROS levels in microalgae (6.75 ± 0.25 μmol H2O2 g−1), thus elevating total photosynthesis resulting in a two-fold increase in carotenoids (457.5 ± 2.5 μg mL−1) over the native microalgae without compromising biomass yield. NMR spectroscopy was additionally applied to acquire a better understanding of pure carotenoids derived from microalgae, which indicated similar peaks in both spectra when compared to β-carotene. Thus, this well-planned bio-hybrid system offers a potential option for the cost-effective and long-term supply of these natural carotenoid bio-products.
1. Introduction
With increased interest and implementation of sustainable processes in recent years through the adoption of all fundamental principles of green chemistry, “phyco-nanobionics” has spawned a new form of nanoscale (1–100 nm) electrical interactions of implanting specific NPs of various sizes and shapes into biological systems of microalgae to unlock hidden potential that would not have been possible as an important contribution to the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology. The advancement of simple, cost-efficient and environmentally friendly approaches for the fabrication of advanced NPs with controlled morphologies and remarkable features has piqued a lot of interest for the preparation of biologically advanced nanomaterials, not only for manipulating their physical, chemical, biological, magnetic, catalytic, optoelectronic, and mechanical properties, but also for their potential implications on ecology and human health, which has become an extensive area of research.1,2 Among the many types of NPs used for various purposes, AgNPs have received the greatest attention in the literature, accounting for roughly 25% of all nanotechnology consumer goods.3
Recent progression in nanotechnology has revealed that due to growing consumer demand for organic foods without disturbing ecological sustainability, the integration of microalgae with nano range silver to produce AgNPs has sparked significant interest in the potential of microalgae to synthesize high-value natural bioactive compounds such as carotenoid pigments for health applications. Because of the health and economic advantages of their powerful antioxidant qualities, carotenoids have been highlighted as an emergent and vital bioactive compound from both industrial and scientific perspectives,4 with β-carotene, astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, lycopene and lutein considered the major carotenoids owing to their potential use as compared to more than 600 naturally occurring carotenoid pigments.5,6 The use of these natural bioactive compounds in functional meals is advantageous because they can protect cells from oxidative damage.7 They are also useful in reducing food degradation during storage and processing. Carotenoid pigments are also known to alter signaling and regulation of several cellular processes.8 Despite the perceived benefits, large-scale and cost-effective production of natural carotenoids has remained a significant challenge, as natural carotenoids account for a marginal segment of the global economy compared to commercially available carotenoids, which are primarily synthesized from petroleum-based chemical sources.9
Microalgae, a potential photoautotrophic-driven workhorse microorganism, utilize CO2 to make high-value naturally occurring carotenoid pigments (red, orange, and yellow) via photosynthesis. Algae species known for synthesizing carotenoid pigments include Chlorella sp., Haematococcus pluvialis, Spirulina platensis, Dunaliella salina, Diatoms, Scenedesmus sp., and Botryococcus braunii.5,10,11 The pigment concentration of microalgae, on the other hand, varies depending on environmental conditions and algal species. However, in order to enhance output, these cell factories (typically microalgae) are frequently stimulated by various stress conditions (for example, light intensity saturation) or genetic alteration. However, genetic alterations of microalgae are expensive and time-consuming while external stimuli are predicted to impede the growth of microalgae and require a lot of energy.4 When exposed to NPs, microalgae employ several defense strategies, including an antioxidative defense system that produces significant amounts of antioxidant carotenoids,12 biomolecule efflux to form a protective layer,13 and intracellular mechanisms to decrease NPs in cellular content to eliminate ROS and free radicals.14
Recently, “phyco-nanobionics” as an integrated approach has been employed to build functional biological-inorganic hybrid systems using photo-active NPs (such as silver, gold nanoclusters, cadmium sulphide, etc.) to improve the overall solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency in carotenoid pigment synthesis in microalgae. The light-absorbing motifs in these bio-hybrid systems typically convert light into photo-generated electrons that can directly regulate specific biological pathways in microalgae, such as NADPH generation and carbon dioxide fixation, thereby expanding prospects for cost-effective and sustainable supply of these natural carotenoid bio-products.4 AgNPs have received a great deal of interest in recent decades, and some studies on their effect on C. vulgaris have also been undertaken. Most prior research concurred with the findings that AgNPs stress induced anti-oxidative responses (i.e., increased production of enzymes like catalase and peroxide oxidase; changes in protein expression; photosynthetic systems alterations, etc.).12,15 Some of the microalgae mediated NPs, include, gold NPs, AgNPs, magnesium NPs, and titanium oxide NPs, which resulted in higher growth promotion, carotenoids, lipid contents, and chlorophyll accumulation.16,17
Therefore, in the present study, HMBE was employed to synthesize HMBE-AgNPs and a biological-inorganic hybrid system was established in which the produced HMBE-AgNPs were integrated in microalgae C. sorokiniana UUIND6 for efficient carotenoid production. The synthesized NPs were also structurally characterized. The biocompatibility and impact of the synthesized NPs on microalgae biomass, chlorophyll content, carotenoid content, cellular uptake of NPs by microalgae, and intracellular translocation of AgNPs were investigated further.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Chemicals and reagents
The analytical grade chemicals, reagents and composition of culture media were obtained from HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd, India and utilized to synthesize AgNPs, prepare Bold Basal Media (BBM), and conduct biochemical analysis.
2.2 Collection and preparation of HMBE
Harmful algal blooms were physically collected from Song River, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India, in the month of November, using a plankton net made of bolting silk (using mesh size no. 25, 48 μm). The macroalgal samples were carried in an icebox to the laboratory and then washed multiple times with Milli-Q water to eliminate any adhering epiphytes before drying in the shade at room temperature (RT). Furthermore, approximately 10 g of chopped macroalgae was combined with 100 mL of sterile Milli-Q water and placed in a magnetic stirrer for 1 h 30 min at 60 °C. It was then allowed to cool before being strained through Whatman No. 1 filter paper. The HMBE filtrate was applied in the production of AgNPs with slight modification (Fig. 1).18

2.3 Synthesis of HMBE-AgNPs
The HMBE-AgNPs were synthesized by gradually adding 2 mM silver nitrate solution (20 mL) in a drop-wise manner in HMBE extract (5 mL) in an Erlenmeyer flask with continuous stirring. The reaction mixture was shaken for 10 min in sunlight to commence the synthesis, and then incubated at RT in the dark wrapped in aluminium foil. The reaction mixture's colour gradually changed from watery yellow to dark brown, indicating the formation of silver nanoparticles by lowering Ag+ to Ag0. The mixture was then heated in the microwave for 5 min. To remove water soluble biological contaminants, the silver nanoparticles were centrifuged (10000 rpm, 10 min) and re-dispersed in Milli-Q water.19 The purification procedure was performed thrice to get impurity-free HMBE-AgNPs, which were then dried at 60 °C and stored at RT for future use using a slight modification method (Fig. 1).18
2.4 Structural characterization of HMBE-AgNPs
The HMBE-AgNPs were purified by centrifugation (15000 rpm) for 20 min at 4 °C and freeze dried. Further tests were performed on the freeze-dried HMBE-AgNPs to validate the synthesized NPs. The crystalline morphology of the synthesized NPs was examined using the X-ray diffraction (XRD; Difray) using chromium as the X-ray source (λ = 2.2909 Å). The chemical composition of the synthesized NPs was determined using FTIR spectra at 400–4000 cm−1 (PerkinElmer, MA, USA).20,21 Using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM; JEOL-100SX), the average size and morphological characteristics of the produced NPs were examined.
2.5 Cultivation of microalgae
Freshwater microalgae C. sorokiniana UUIND6 isolated previously was exploited for this study, which was maintained and cultivated in BBM. To achieve the log phase for biomass production, the algal cultures were incubated at 25 ± 2 °C for 14 days under cool white LED lights (300 μmol m−2 s−1) with a photoperiod of 16:8 (light:dark). Microalgal growth was monitored by measuring O.D.686nm using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Model 1906).22
2.6 Bio-compatibility determination of HMBE-AgNPs
In the exponential growth phase, C. sorokiniana UUIND6 (cell density O.D 0.2.) was inoculated in the 500 mL conical flask with a working solution of 250 mL BBM medium containing various HMBE-AgNP concentrations (1, 2.5, 5 and 10 ppm) for 14 days under the same light and temperature conditions as before (Fig. 1). The microalgal suspension was mixed after every 6 h manually. After incubation, the microalgal cells were washed twice with water to remove any unbound HMBE-AgNPs. The growth rate was evaluated by measuring the culture absorbance at 680 nm. The biocompatibility of HMBE-AgNPs against previously isolated UUIND6 was assessed by determining the biomass concentration of microalgae cells based on dry cell weight (DCW), dried overnight at 80 °C in a hot-air oven. Lyophilized microalgae pellets were collected for further investigation.4
2.7 Estimation of ROS levels
The amount of ROS produced at various concentrations of NPs was measured in terms of H2O2. The microalgal pellets were homogenized in 0.1% trichloroacetic acid (w/v), and the samples were centrifuged at 15880 g for 10 min. 0.5 mL supernatant was combined with 0.5 mL phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7) and 1 mL potassium iodide (1 M). For 60 min, the reaction mixture was kept in the dark. The absorbance of the supernatant at 390 nm was used to calculate H2O2 levels and expressed in terms of μmol H2O2/g, which was computed using a standard calibration curve with known H2O2 concentrations (Fig. S1, ESI†).23
2.8 Photosynthetic performance of the bio-hybrid system
Total pigments expressed as chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-b, and carotenoids were computed to analyze the photosynthetic performance of Chlorella UUIND6. 2 mL of microalgae cell solution was taken every week, and pigments were extracted with methanol (99.99%; v/v).24 Readings taken at 470, 652.4, and 665.2 nm were corrected by eliminating absorbance at 750 nm. The following formulas were used to calculate photosynthetic pigment concentrations:Chlorophyll a (Chl a; μg mL−1) = 16.72A665.2 − 9.16A652.4Chlorophyll b (Chl b; μg mL−1) = 34.09A652.4 − 15.28A665.2Carotenoids (μg mL−1) = (1000A470 − 1.63 Chl a − 104.9 Chl b)/221
The concentrated pigments were diluted in HPLC grade methanol (1 mL) to determine the carotenoid content, which were further diluted to get separate peaks at their correct concentrations. A Supelco-LC-18 column with a 25 cm 4.6 m; 5 m High-performance liquid chromatography PDA detector was utilized (Shimadzu SPD-20A HPLC). The mobile phase mixture was composed of acetonitrile and water in the following proportions: (75:25 or 70:30). For HPLC analysis, the following parameters were used: flow rate of 0.6 mL min−1, injection volume of 5 L, and detection range of 270 nm.
2.9 Cellular uptake determination of HMBE-AgNPs
The microalgal biomass was washed 3–4 times with distilled water to remove the surface attached AgNPs and was digested in nitric acid:hydrochloric acid in the ratio (1:3 v/v) at 120 °C until the solution was clear. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was utilized to quantify the concentration of intracellular HMBE-AgNPs after diluting with water and filtering through 0.22 μm membrane filters.4
2.10 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of microalgal metabolites
Lyophilized microalgae biomass (100 mg) was vortexed for 5 min in 50 mL of chloroform. For cell disruption at room temperature, an ultrasonic water bath was employed for 30 min. The extract was separated from cell debris using filtration filter paper No. 1. The residue was then dried and re-extracted twice with methanol. The filtered extracts were collected and dried using a rotary evaporator before being kept at −20 °C for 1H NMR metabolite analysis.25
2.11 Statistical analysis
All experimental data analysis was performed in triplicate (n = 3). The variability of the data is shown as mean ± standard deviation and one-way ANOVA was performed to determine the significance of the results (p < 0.05). All the figures/graphs were plotted with the programme OriginPro 8.0 and Microsoft Excel. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using SIMCA 13.0. The heatmap of metabolite ratios was created using Multi Experiment Viewer software.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization of HMBE-AgNPs
The X-ray diffraction pattern of biosynthesized HMBE-AgNPs and the incidence of supplemented AgNPs in microalgae biomass (MB) are illustrated in Fig. (2). The distinct peaks of diffraction patterns at 2θ of 32.3°, 46, 2°, 67.3° and 76.7° corresponding to the plane of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1), respectively, indicates the nature of the silver nanoparticles in fcc and crystalline (JCPDS: 84-0713 and 04-0783).26 In the microalgal biomass sample supplemented with AgNPs, viz. MB–Ag-0 (control), MB–Ag-1, MB–Ag-2.5 and MB–Ag-5, a broad peak has appeared at 2θ of 20° due to the amorphous nature of the microalgal biomass. It has been observed that as the concentration of supplemented AgNPs increases, the incidence of supplemented Ag-NPs in the microalgae biomass has been increasingly seen, as reflected in the diffraction pattern. The increase in the intensity of the incidence of supplemented Ag-NPs is due to the greater bioaccumulation in the cells of the microalgae. AgNPs have been absorbed and transferred into the cellular content of microalgal cells due to the permeable size range of biosynthesized AgNPs.27–29 However, the MB–Ag-1 have not clearly shown the presence of supplemented AgNPs due to the lesser concentration, likewise we have observed that there were no diffraction peaks in the MB–Ag-0 sample since it was not supplemented with AgNPs. In the figure, the pristine AgNP sample showed characteristic peaks, while the MB–Ag-0 sample (without AgNP treatment) showed a hump-shaped peak that is due to amorphous components of microalgae biomass. The MB–Ag-1 and MB–Ag-2.5 did not evidently display the presence of the supplemented AgNP in the treatment, but the amorphous peak of microalgae biomass was clearly observed. Noticeably, the MB–Ag-5 sample very clearly demonstrated the existence of supplemented AgNP along with the amorphous peaks of microalgae biomass. The suppression of the supplemented AgNP peaks in the MB–Ag-1 and MB–Ag-2.5 sample is due to the minimal concentration compared to the microalgae biomass, while significant evidence for the incidence of AgNP peaks in the biomass is due to the supplementation of increased AgNP concentration (in the sample MB–Ag-5).

FTIR analysis was used to detect the existence of the potential functional groups within the MB associated with AgNPs that may be responsible for Ag+ reduction and AgNPs stabilization (Fig. 3 and Table S1, ESI†). The majority of the infrared absorption peaks were identified in the MB sample without AgNPs (MB–Ag-0). A strong and broad-spectrum band at 3421 cm−1 suggests alcohols or phenols (inter-molecular O–H stretch), while several medium stretching sorption peaks between 2850–3100 cm−1 are attributable to carbohydrate and lipid functional groups (C–H and C–H). The stretching vibrations of –CC– and CO bonds associated with β-unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, and alkenes have a peak at 1654 cm−1. The peak at 1530 cm−1 can be attributed to aromatic and nitro compounds via C–C and N–O stretching vibrations. The presence of alkanes and aromatic amines was indicated by a somewhat stretched band at 1408 cm−1 and 1318 cm−1 for C–H bend/C–H rock groups and C–N groups, respectively. C–N and C–N/R–O–C/R–O–CH3 stretching indicate aliphatic amines and protein components, with peaks between 1020–1250 cm−1 and 700–1000 cm−1. On the other hand, single but comparable peaks (in bolded red line) were identified at 557 cm−1, indicating the existence of AgNPs in spiked MB (MB–Ag-1, MB–Ag-2.5, and MB–Ag-5) as strong absorption is demonstrated by Ag metal NPs in visible light wavelengths.30 The incidence of supplemented AgNPs in microalgal biomass has been further confirmed with HR-TEM analysis.

The morphologic and crystallographic properties of HMBE-AgNPs in microalgae cells were verified using TEM. According to the current investigation, all of the synthesized NPs in TEM images and particle size distribution were well dispersed, withs spherical shapes exhibiting a narrow size distribution, with typical particle sizes ranging from 6 to 12 nm in Fig. 4(A). The particle size distribution graph presented in Fig. 4(B) indicates an average particle size of 10 nm for HMBE-AgNPs. As the microalgae cell wall acts as a selective semi-permeable barrier with thickness varying from 5 to 20 nm, making it more permeable to pass HMBE-AgNPs without causing cell lysis.31 These findings provide credence to the structural integrity of microalgal cells scattered around NPs. The inclusion of secondary materials may also be detected from the capping with dark hues on the NPs surface, which may be attributed to various compounds such as polysaccharides, polyphenols, and proteins that can be present in the HMBE extract giving different shapes to the synthesized NPs.32–35 These compounds within the HMBE extract not only result in the effective reduction of Ag salts to NPs, but also act as a suitable capping agent, limiting aggregation.36 Smaller NPs have the potential to be far more reactive than the larger ones.37–39

3.2 Bio-compatibility of HMBE-AgNPs with Chlorella UUIND6
Changes in the optimum concentration of AgNPs disrupt the metabolic pathways of microalgae, altering its biomass. In the present investigation, the microalgae culture exhibited a comparable growth trend for the first 12 days in all AgNP concentrations. The microalgal culture growth displayed a lag phase from day 0 to the 6th day and an exponential phase from the 6th day until the 12th day before entering the stationary phase on the 13th day. The microalgae cultivation at 5 ppm HMBE-AgNPs seems to be the best concentration as shown in Fig. 5, with the highest biomass concentration of C. sorokiniana being 0.78 ± 0.18 g L−1. This might be attributed to the fact as Ag is a non-essential metal with no biological activities in growth, hence will not induce microalgal growth at the beginning of the exposure.31 Moreover, microalgae adaptation to the presence of a protective carotenoid from AgNPs stress capable of protecting the cells.36 Nevertheless, further increase of AgNPs concentration to 10 ppm led to the decrease in microalgal growth reaching a total biomass concentration of 0.575 ± 0.04 g L−1 at the end of the 14 days of cultivation period. In this regard, the toxicity of HMBE-AgNPs to freshwater microalgae appears to be connected to AgNPs indirect cytotoxic mechanisms, such as the quantity of Ag+ in culture medium, which is correlated with particle size assessed by TEM.

Numerous studies have shown that NPs also had detrimental effects on microalgae species, such as MgSO4 NPs (1000 ppm), which had an inhibiting effect on batch microalgae fermentation.37 The use of 200 ppm zinc oxide NPs on Chlorella might reduce photosynthesis and respiration efficiency, as well as cause algal cell death.38 This could be due to the fact that high NP concentrations can cause either a shading effect, resulting in insufficient light for algal cells and decreased photosynthetic output,39 or interaction of NPs with proteins, which disrupts ATP synthesis in the cell, causing DNA damage and inhibiting algal cell growth.14 The obstruction of cell division caused by large quantities of AgNPs might be another factor that potentially disrupts microalgae metabolism, resulting in cell death.40,41
3.3 Photosynthetic performance of the bio-hybrid system
The photosynthetic efficiency of the bio-hybrid system was investigated by evaluating the concentration of primary pigment, i.e., chlorophyll, in the photosystem to elucidate the functions of AgNPs in biosynthesis. Chlorophyll is essential in both photosynthesis antennas and reaction centres, where it receives light and transmits the accumulated energy to chlorophylls in the reaction centre. The addition of metals such as AgNPs to the microalgae culture medium has indirect effects on chlorophyll synthesis and degradation, and also modifies the chlorophyll-a and b ratio (Chl-a/Chl-b), which can be interpreted as an expression of the sensitivity of the light harvesting complex -II (LHC-II) enzyme system of chloroplasts to external factors.42 Any variation (Chl-a/Chl-b ratio) indicates a shift in the stoichiometric balance between the PS-II light-collecting complex and reaction centre complexes of both PS.43
The experimental findings revealed that the concentration of Chl-a increased by 115% with an increase in AgNP concentration up to 5 ppm and then decreased at 10 ppm AgNP concentration while on the other hand, Chl-b was found to be in a lower concentration compared to Chl-a, but increased by 45% in all the tested concentrations (Fig. 6). At 5 ppm HMBE-AgNPs, the microalgae demonstrated a greater Chl-a/Chl-b ratio in treated microalgal cells, which might be a marker of the NPs’ physiological reaction on the microalgal growth.43 This is because ROS levels produced by AgNPs play an indispensable role for regulating photosynthesis and several other cellular activities, thus have the potential to attack chlorophyll, causing some Chl-b to change to Chl-a, resulting in increased Chl-a in microalgae cells. Additionally, a boost in Chl-a content may be due to acceptor side inhibition, whereas on a contrary hand, when AgNPs interact with ROS, they also exert both direct and indirect effects on algae under varied exposure conditions.40,44 5 ppm zinc oxide NPs boost the chlorophyll concentration in Chlorella marina.45

Some researchers, on the other hand, stated that a drop in Chl-a may be connected to changes in environmental factors, such as pollutants interfering with pigment production46 and is associated to damage in chloroplast ribosomes. Others reported that reduction in Chl-a content may be due to electron transport chain (ETC) inhibition in the donor centre.31 Previous studies also focused on the toxicity of AgNPs in microalgae as indicators of physiological changes caused by accelerating chlorophyllase activity or stimulating ROS production resulting in chl-a content decrease due to pigment damage in exposed cells or reduction in pigment–protein complexes47 for instance, using Ag nanoclusters Zhang et al.48 established a photosynthetic toxicity mechanism against the green microalgae Scenedesmus obliquus where they discovered the Ag nanocluster's toxicity was largely due to the “joint-toxicity” effect of the particulate form of Ag clusters and their released Ag+, which disrupted the electron transport chain (ETC) of light reaction and affected the content of main enzymes of the calvin cycle of algae cells. Moreover, NPs in microalgal cells adhere to the cell wall or the cell surface, resulting in the formation of large aggregates. This aggregate formation could be the cause of microalgal cell entrapment and cell division limitation, leading to cell division suppression.49 Nevertheless, the toxicity of NPs in microalgae varies depending on the species, dosage, size, coating, and length of NP exposure.49–52
However, our study differs from those stated studies on Chl-a and Chl-b and was found to be consistent with the current findings, which indicated a gradual rise in Chl-a concentration per cell from 62% to 397%, and Chl-b concentration per cell increased from 42% to 316% in the presence of 90 to 720 g L−1 AgNPs.28 The current study findings showed the effect of all the different AgNP concentration treatments including the control which demonstrated a significant (p < 0.05) variation among Chl-a, Chl-b, and Chl-a/Chl-b (Table S2–S4, ESI†), indicating that the presence of HMBE-AgNPs did not significantly hinder chlorophyll synthesis activity in biohybrid systems due to microalgae's adaptive response at a greater Chl-a/Chl-b ratio content and keeping a stable level of chlorophyll.
AgNPs have also been used to study the changes in another biomolecule content such as carotenoid content in microalgae, due to their strong chemical reactivity and capacity to function as electron donors to catalyze a wide range of processes. It also produces a variety of ROS, which induce oxidative damage to cells.53 Due to intercellular and intracellular activity, microalgae cells are exposed to such free ROS including hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, singlet oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide. As these ROS contain free electrons in their valence layer, they generate undesired interactions in cells, which can impair normal processes via lipid peroxidation and thiol group oxidation on protein and DNA.54 Thus, in order to trap ROS, living cells produce antioxidants.53 The ROS content of Chlorella sp. under the impact of various NP concentrations was investigated in order to evaluate the metal caused ROS stress, particularly H2O2. The amount of H2O2 in 5 ppm HMBE-AgNPs concentration was found to produce the highest amount of ROS (6.75 ± 0.25 μmol H2O2 g−1), indicating that cells are under greatest stress when compared with the control (3.5 ± 0.01 μmol H2O2 g−1). When microalgal cells are exposed to stressful conditions, particularly metallic NPs, the intracellular amount and rate of ROS generation significantly increases, which has been well acclaimed in the literature regarding algae and cyanobacteria. The presence of ROS stimulates antioxidant production by neutralizing the ROS or their harmful effects. Previous research also determined that carotenoids contribute significantly to non-enzymatic antioxidative compounds, which act as effective quenchers and play an important role in protecting microalgae from oxidative stress.
Previous studies have shown that carotenoids provide a significant contribution to non-enzymatic antioxidative compounds, which are effective quenchers and play a key role in protecting microalgae from oxidative stress. As a result, oxidative stress might be viewed as a trigger mechanism for metal-exposed microalgae cells to produce target chemicals. Our finding also displayed that the carotenoids content of C. sorokiniana was considerably increased after exposure to 1–5 ppm of AgNP concentration, with the maximum carotenoid production at 5 ppm (457.5 ± 2.5 μg mL−1) reported on the 14th day, resulting in a two-fold increase in carotenoid content as compared to the control as depicted in Fig. 7. Carotenoid content was also found to be significant (p < 0.05) across all treatments (Table S5, ESI†). These findings were consistent with those reported in Nannochloropsis oculata, which showed a substantial rise in carotenoid content after exposure to 1–50 mg L−1 of AgNPs, with the greatest level found at 50 mg L−1 of AgNP concentration.55 As a result, it was observed that when microalgae are subjected to metal-induced oxidative stress, reducing power accumulates within the cells, increasing plastoquinone pool (PQ-pool) reduction (a redox state component of the ETC). During state transitions in response to physiological stress, both photosystem-I (PS-I) and photosystem-II (PS-II), are involved directly in light energy distribution and is thus important for carotenoids synthesis. The transfer of the light harvesting complex (LHC) associated with PS-II (LHC-II) to the PS-I is promoted by the decrease of the PQ-pool (State-2 transition), while LHC-II is associated with PS-II during the State-1 transition, which happens when oxidation of the PQ-pool occurs.56 The degree of reduction in the PQ-pool is related to a shift in electron flow between cyclic and linear. With an excessive reduction of PQ-pool (State-2) between cyclic and linear electron flow, the PS-I cross section increases and cyclic electron transport is preferred, but under oxidative conditions (State-1), the PS-II cross section lowers and linear electron transport may be observed.57–59 As a result, the thylakoid lumen becomes acidified, which can activate several enzymes involved in carotenogenesis. Previous researchers found that a low concentration of NPs might boost the carotenoid production, but a high concentration of NPs can induce a decrease owing to disruption to biosynthetic pathways, as evident in our data.60,61

3.4 Cellular uptake and bioaccumulation of HMBE-AgNPs in microalgae
Knowing the structural characteristics of the synthesized HMBE-AgNPs, ICP-MS analysis at different concentrations was used to examine the cellular uptake and bioaccumulation on C. sorokiniana UUIND6 cells. Under the aforementioned experimental conditions, it was clearly demonstrated that bioaccumulation in microalgae cells at 5 ppm HMBE-AgNPs concentration was significantly greater (p < 0.05), i.e., 55.2%, as compared to other NP concentrations. NPs at 1 ppm, on the other hand, showed the least bioaccumulation and were predominantly found on microalgal surfaces. In the current investigation, the aforementioned TEM images and particle size distribution of the synthesized NPs clearly indicated the unique localization of AgNPs with diverse sizes. Due to the fact that the cell wall is the primary site for microalgae-NP interactions, the intracellular fate of AgNPs is largely dictated by their size in contrast to the microalgae cell wall pore size (5–20 nm). Since the average size of the NPs in this study was found to be 10 nm (smaller than the pore size of the microalgal cell wall), it clearly demonstrated that synthesized HMBE-AgNPs may readily penetrate the cell wall and accumulate inside the microalgal cells. For example, AgNPs (<80 nm) seem to be capable of entering bacterial cells.62
Although several research studies have been published so far demonstrating the internalization of Ag, TiO2, or CuO NPs in various microalgal species,63 the mechanism and system of NP intracellular uptake remain mostly unknown. However, there is also disagreement over the postulated pathways and methods of MNP internalization in algal cells, which are largely speculative and have yet to be proved.64
In this context, it was discovered from the literature that NP accumulation mostly involves NP adsorption on cell wall functional groups.59 Externally charged NPs (either positive or negative charged NPs) electrostatically bind to the negatively charged microalgal cell surface and fuse with the cell wall. Cationic NPs entered cells by diffusion and anionic NPs via endocytosis.62 The rate of NP diffusion varies with the biochemical makeup and structure of the cell wall of various species of microalgae. After cell surface adsorption, NPs passively diffuse into the space between the cell membrane and cell wall through nano-sized pores after breaching the cell wall.64 The next step of NP intracellular absorption involves transport through the cell membrane's lipid bilayer, possibly through an undiscovered protein-mediated transmembrane transport pathway or by non-mediated simple transport pathway. The composition and fluidity of the bilayers, as well as the shape and charge of the NPs, all impact NP permeability.65 However, when certain NPs interact with the cell membrane, cell membrane perforation is thought to be prompted, allowing NPs to enter the cell's interior (cytosol), as evidenced by a shift in NP-induced phospholipid metabolism leading to the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids.66,67 Once they reach the cytosol, the NPs bind to cellular organelles, interfering with metabolic, photosynthetic or respiratory functions, and triggering ROS production. Notably, the ion released and the formation of ROS are concentration-dependent, therefore a low concentration is preferred to avoid severe cellular damage.
3.5 Metabolic modification in C. sorokiniana UUIND6 after HMBE-AgNP exposure
To achieve a better understanding of the variable effect of HMBE-AgNPs on C. sorokiniana UUIND6, metabolites extracted from organic microalga extracts were studied using NMR spectroscopy. The cumulative spectra of 1H NMR with 3 replicates (n = 3 each) of microalga UUIND6 control polar extracts were compared to cultures treated with 5 ppm HMBE-AgNPs as shown in Fig. 8(A). Table S5 (ESI†) illustrates the composition of the 13 identified metabolites which were evaluated using distinct peaks of NMR and quantified by their area underneath and designed a heat map using hierarchical cluster analysis. “When compared to the standard β-carotene spectra, the 1H-NMR spectra of pure carotenoids isolated from microalgae (MB-CARs) displayed comparable peaks and were measured in the range of 1–10 ppm depicted in Fig. 8(B) and Table S7 (ESI†). The aliphatic conjugated double bond characterizes standard β-carotene. When the individual intensities of MB-CARs were compared to the standard, the presence of four distinct peaks was observed for MB-CARs including methylenes, methylenes to carbonyl, allylic methylenes, and glyceryl and olefinic methine, with values ranging from 1.0–1.4 ppm, 1.5–1.8 ppm, 1.9–2.1 ppm, and 5.2–5.5 ppm, respectively. The hierarchical clustered heat map clearly allows a better understanding of the differences between samples based on the NP effect on microalgae (Fig. 9). The identified metabolites include carotenoids, lutein, violaxanthin, zeaxanthin, astaxanthin, Chl-a, fatty acyl chains, glycolipids (glucosyl, glyceryl, galactosyl moieties), linoleic acid, and linolenic acid. The significant variations in NMR response under spiked and control cultures were attributed to chemical heterogeneity and found to be higher in the spiked cultures compared to the control. Furthermore, multivariate analysis using PCA was performed to validate the variation across the two treatments. The PCA analysis is represented in the 2D score plot (Fig. 10) validating statistically significant clustering of the 3 biological replicates of C. sorokiniana UUIND6 implying that the altered metabolic profile in both cases (control and HMBE-AgNP treated microalgal samples). Plotting component 1 (PC1) against component 2 (PC2) allowed better pattern recognition based on group similarity or dissimilarity. PC1 has the most variance (78.8%), followed by PC2 (10.2%). The high PC (89%) demonstrated that the treatments were responsible for the majority of the variance in the current investigation. This is because NPs have been often linked to an increase in ROS levels in microalgae. As the NPs pass through the cell wall, two phases occur: (a) quick absorption and (2) transit into the cytoplasm, where the NPs might attach to cellular organelles, interfering with metabolites, photosynthetic or respiratory functions, and triggering ROS generation.68 ROS production is concentration-dependent, and at the right NP concentration can accelerate growth and metabolite accumulation in microalgae. These alterations might be one of the microalgae's adaptive or defensive strategies to defend themselves from the oxidative stress generated by HMBE-AgNPs.28

4. Conclusions
Carotenoids are gaining commercial success due to their health benefits, which account for the majority of the worldwide market. The modified light-driven inorganic-microalgae system is a well-established tool that enables the efficient manufacture of natural carotenoids using HMBE and efficient light-harvesting AgNPs to synthesize HMBE-AgNPs and integrating the synthesized HMBE-AgNPs in various concentrations into the microalgae C. sorokiniana UUIND6 to improve the overall solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency in carotenoid pigment synthesis in microalgae. The TEM images and particle size distribution of the synthesized NPs clearly demonstrated the unique localization of 10 nm AgNP size (smaller than the pore size of the microalgal cell wall), which readily penetrate the cell wall and accumulate inside the microalgal cells. The current study findings also demonstrated high biocompatibility of 5 ppm HMBE-AgNP concentration that can serve as a built-in photo-sensitizer and significantly improve ROS levels in microalgae (6.75 ± 0.25 μmol H2O2/g), thus elevating total photosynthesis resulting in a two-fold increase in carotenoids (457.5 ± 2.5 μg mL−1) over the native microalgae without compromising biomass yield. 1H NMR spectroscopy was additionally applied to acquire a better understanding of pure carotenoids derived from microalgae, which indicated similar peaks in both spectra when compared to β-carotene. As a result, this well-planned biological-inorganic hybrid system might provide a cost-effective and long-term supply of natural carotenoid bio-products. However, a cheaper and more scalable cultivation method of biological-inorganic interface is currently being explored in order to increase solar energy conversion efficiency and obtain natural product production in a sustainable and cost-effective manner.
