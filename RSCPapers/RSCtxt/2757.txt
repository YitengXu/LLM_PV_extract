    First published on 17th June 2019AbstractIn recent years, nanocrystals of metal sulfide materials have attracted scientific research interest for renewable energy applications due to the abundant choice of materials with easily tunable electronic, optical, physical and chemical properties. Metal sulfides are semiconducting compounds where sulfur is an anion associated with a metal cation; and the metal ions may be in mono-, bi- or multi-form. The diverse range of available metal sulfide materials offers a unique platform to construct a large number of potential materials that demonstrate exotic chemical, physical and electronic phenomena and novel functional properties and applications. To fully exploit the potential of these fascinating materials, scalable methods for the preparation of low-cost metal sulfides, heterostructures, and hybrids of high quality must be developed. This comprehensive review indicates approaches for the controlled fabrication of metal sulfides and subsequently delivers an overview of recent progress in tuning the chemical, physical, optical and nano- and micro-structural properties of metal sulfide nanocrystals using a range of material fabrication methods. For hydrogen energy production, three major approaches are discussed in detail: electrocatalytic hydrogen generation, powder photocatalytic hydrogen generation and photoelectrochemical water splitting. A variety of strategies such as structural tuning, composition control, doping, hybrid structures, heterostructures, defect control, temperature effects and porosity effects on metal sulfide nanocrystals are discussed and how they are exploited to enhance performance and develop future energy materials. From this literature survey, energy conversion currently relies on a limited range of metal sulfides and their composites, and several metal sulfides are immature in terms of their dissolution, photocorrosion and long-term durability in electrolytes during water splitting. Future research directions for innovative metal sulfides should be closely allied to energy and environmental issues, along with their advanced characterization, and developing new classes of metal sulfide materials with well-defined fabrication methods.

1. Introduction
As a result of its potentially cost-effective approach and ecofriendly nature, the utilization of solar energy for splitting of water into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) using nanostructured electrocatalytic and/or photocatalytic materials has attracted research interest. To date, numerous types of catalytic and/or photocatalytic semiconducting materials have been examined; this includes metal oxides,1–6 metal nitrides and oxy-nitrides,7–10 metal sulfides,11–13 alkali metal base,7,14 Z-scheme systems,15–19 and organic (carbon, graphene etc.) materials.20–23 Among them, metal oxides, metal sulfides and their composite forms have received more attention. Notably, many metal oxides exhibit a wide band gap, since their valence band comprises a deep 2p oxygen orbital, and hole carriers have a comparatively heavy effective mass owing to the localized nature of the oxygen 2p state.24–26 Hence, metal sulfides have received attention over the past decades due to their suitable electronic band gap, band position, exposed active sites and their promising catalytic and photocatalytic activity. In contrast to metal oxides, metal sulfides often have a shallow valence band24,27,28 and due to their small effective mass, they exhibit a robust quantum size effect.29–31 In addition, due to their availability in a variety of shapes, sizes, crystalline forms, chemical compositions and their excellent photon (light) response, metal sulfide materials have a range of potential novel properties which can contribute to harvesting the complete solar light spectrum. To create such a high performance photocatalytic system, photocatalytic materials with an ability to harvest visible-light and electrons and/or holes with excellent mobilities for promoting effective charge separation are necessary.32–35 To date, a variety of metal sulfides and their nano-scale composites have shown a substantial enhancement in electrical conductivity, surface morphology, long-term durability, and often a metallic luster, which are beneficial for efficient energy conversion and storage applications.36–43
There are a number of excellent reviews on metal sulfide materials;44–52 however they have an emphasis on either one or a limited number of metal sulfide systems for energy conversion and storage applications. This review will focus on exploiting hydrogen energy evolution using these materials via three novel energy conversion systems, namely (i) electrochemical, (ii) photocatalytic (iii) photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications and beyond are summarized; as outlined in Scheme 1. The intention of this comprehensive review is not to simply summarise the hydrogen energy production mechanisms, as these have been covered in detail elsewhere; for instance see ref. 44–52. This review is the first to deliver an in-depth overview and knowledge on the variety of synthetic strategies for forming metal sulfides and their structural, chemical, and physical property modification. It will also describe how energy harvesting metal sulfide materials and strategies has been utlized to achieve effective hydrogen generation. Finally, the critical challenges that need to be addressed in future research activities are discussed, with an aim to initiate new efforts in this emerging research area.

2. Chemical structures of metal sulfides
Sulfide is the simplest inorganic sulfur anion with the chemical formula S2−, or a compound containing one or more S2− ions. Metal sulfides are compounds in which the sulfur anion is combined with a metal or semi-metal cation or cations to form MxSy giving the mono-metal sulfides of MS, M2S, M3S4 and MS2 stoichiometries.53 In a similar approach, the formation of bi-metal sulfides leads to A1−xBxSy, where x and y are integers.4,54 To date, several hundreds of metal sulfide materials have been recognized and they are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Many of the metal sulfides are structurally simple and exhibit high symmetry. In addition, they have excellent physical and chemical properties, which are coupled with a high specific gravity and low hardness. Table 3 highlights the sulfur source materials used to prepare metal sulfide materials. Importantly, the metal and sulfur atomic arrangements in metal sulfides are combinations of a close-packed system, engaged by ionic size and charge,55–57 where notable points are: (i) the most symmetrical and important structural type is the simple sodium chloride (NaCl) structure, where each ion occupies a position within an octahedron containing six oppositely charged nearest neighbors (e.g. PbS; galena). If the crystal structure contains two sulfide ions in each of the octahedral positions in the NaCl structure, the structure is a high-symmetric pyrite, (ii) the next structural type is sphalerite (ZnS), where each metal ion is surrounded by six oppositely charged ions arranged tetrahedrally, and (iii) the third important structural type is the fluorite form, where the metal cation is surrounded by eight anions; every anion, in turn, is surrounded by four metal cations (e.g. CaF2). Conversely, if the atomic positions are reversed, and the metal cation is surrounded by four anions and each anion is surrounded by eight metal cations, the anti-fluorite structure is formed (mostly alkali metal sulfides; Li2S, Na2S, K2S and Rb2S etc.).

Typically, as shown in Fig. 1a, the bonding of the transition metal sulfides is covalent, which increases the semiconducting properties, but some have metallic properties.58–61 The covalent effect of sulfur allows sulfur–sulfur (S–S) bonds and the assimilation of S2 pairs in some metal sulfides, such as pyrite. A number of sulfides, including MoS2, WS2 and CuS, also have layered structures. Moreover, a number of exceptional metal sulfide varieties such as CdIn2S4,62 LiTi2S463 and CuCr2S464 have the cubic spinel structure. The common formula for the spinel group is AB2S4, where A denotes a divalent metal ion such as Mg, Fe, Ni, Mn and/or Zn. Typically, cations with lesser radii favor the occupation of A sites, habitually, the quad valent (also called as tetravalent) lead ion can also occupy this site. Generally, the tetrahedral (A-site) interstices are smaller than the octahedral (B-site) interstices.54 B denotes trivalent metal ions such as Al, Fe, Cr and/or Mn, Ti. Sulfur (S) usually adopts a 2− oxidation state and to sustain valence symmetry, notably, the A cation can be in the 2+ or 4+ oxidation state and the consistent B cation can be in 3+ or 2+ oxidation state.4 These structural possibilities can be stated as A2+B23+X42− and A4+B22+X42−.

3. Comparison and classification of metal sulfides
To date, several metal sulfides and metal sulfide nanocomposite materials have been reported for energy conversion and storage. As shown in Table 1, several hundred sulfide materials can act as efficient electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for hydrogen production. In brief, most of the sulfide photocatalysts are comprised of d10 configured metal cations since the metal sulfide catalysts conduction bands are composed of d and sp orbitals, while the valence bands consist of S 3p orbitals, which are much more negative than O 2p orbitals, as shown in Fig. 1b. This offers sufficient negative conduction band positions to reduce H2O to hydrogen and oxygen. In addition, the narrow band gap provides a good response to the complete solar spectrum compared to oxide materials.24,65–68 As shown in Fig. 1(c and d), this reaction produces H2 at room temperature but does not consume fossil fuels and does not emit CO2.
3.1 Comparison of metal sulfides to metal oxides
Metal sulfides differ from metal oxides in their chemical composition, and the metal sulfides are attractive catalytic and photocatalyst materials for electrocatalytic hydrogen generation, PEC water splitting, environmental remediation, batteries, and sensors.12,24,28,69–73 Metal sulfide nanostructures possess exceptional qualities including high photosensitivity, large specific capacities, low redox potential, and a long lifetime compared to metal oxides. Furthermore, due to the high theoretical volume expansion calculated using traditional conversion reaction formula, several metal sulfides, such as SnS2 and MoS2,37,74–78 have a layered structure which can help alleviate strain induced by a volume expansion. Metal sulfides provide high selectivity and sensitivity to specific classes of molecules at a working temperature that is lower than classical metal oxides such as TiO2,79 Fe2O3,80 WO381 and CuO.82,83 An additional feature of metal sulfides, which differentiates them from metal oxides, is their lower melting points. Therefore, the focus on metal sulfide materials, where sulfur atoms replace oxygen, can provide a route to sensitive, selective, and stable photo-sensing materials for energy conversion applications. However, metal-oxide materials continue to retain a prominent role due to their high sensitivity, selectivity, low-cost, small dimensions and simple integration.
3.2 Classification of nanostructured materials
Recently, several hundreds of nanostructured materials have been prepared by a variety of routes; and there is a need for their structural classification.84,85 Initially, Gleiter86 proposed the classification of nanostructured materials and Skorokhod85 subsequently elucidated these structures. However, Gleiter and Skorokhod's schemes were not fully considered since 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D structures such as fullerenes, nanotubes, and nanoflowers were not taken into consideration. Later, a modified structural catalog for nanomaterials was proposed by Pokropivny and Skorokhod,87 in which 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D structures were incorporated, and their schemes are shown in Fig. 2.

4. Synthesis of nanostructured metal sulfides
The large-scale synthesis of metal sulfides and their derivatives with well-defined shape, size, layered structure, and defect states is essential, which is the initial step towards achieving high-performance materials. To date, numerous methods have been developed to prepare high-quality metal sulfides, including mono-metal sulfides, bi-metal sulfides, multi-metal sulfides, doped and heterostructures. Therefore, a strong correlation between the nanostructures and their functional properties has encouraged research for controlled synthesis of innovative energy materials with tailored nanostructures. The existing synthesis methodologies of metal sulfides include physical and chemical methods. However, for easy classification we have separated them into two techniques based on ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ fabrication methods, see Fig. 3, on the basis of common manufacturing methods.88–92
 Fig. 3  Schematic of commonly used synthesis methods. 
4.1 Top-down approaches
Typically, a top-down approach refers to slicing or successive reduction of a bulk material to achieve nano-sized particles.

4.1.1 Sputtering. 
The fabrication of large areas of metal sulfide in a uniform thin film is the ultimate aim for commercial level device manufacture. Sputtering is a rapid physical vapor deposition technique for the fabrication of thin films that consist of nanoparticles. For the preparation of polycrystalline monolayer metal sulfide nanostructures, magnetron sputtering deposition has proven to be better than chemical vapour deposition (CVD) due to its ease of fabrication, low-cost, rapid high production and scalability.93–97 During synthesis, argon (Ar) ions are ionized by collisions with electrons which initially bombard the target materials. Then, the sputtering particles from the target will deposit on the substrate to form a thin film. Recently, transferable and continuous centimeter sized polycrystalline WS2 monolayer films were fabricated98 on the surface of a quartz substrate using WS2 precursor film and sulfur powder, as shown in Fig. 4. As a result, a WS2 thin film with a thickness of ∼25.2 nm exhibited an amorphous nature and after post-annealing its crystallinity increased with diffraction peaks observed at 14.31°, 29.02° and 43.74°, which were indexed to the (002), (004) and (006) crystal planes of hexagonal WS2, as shown in Fig. 4. This confirmed the fine layer stacking along the crystallographic c-axis. In addition, monolayer or few-layer MoS2 thin films have been prepared at high temperatures on a variety of substrates using magnetron sputtering.99 Mo atoms react with vaporized S atoms to form a MoS2 thin film. Meanwhile, the MoS2 film grown on sapphire exhibited narrower and stronger Raman peaks compared to that on SiO2, and was reported to be of improved crystallinity. In addition, to obtain Cu3BiS3 thin films, a metal precursor of Cu–Bi was sputtered onto fused silica substrates (50 mm × 50 mm) in a hydrogen sulfide (H2S) environment.100 The thin films of Cu3BiS3 were highly dependent on the ratio of copper (Cu), bismuth (Bi) and H2S. Several other metalsulfide thin films, including CuInS2,101,102 PbS,103 In2S3,104 and FeS2105,106 have also been formed.

4.1.2 Electrospinning. 
Electrospinning is known as an effective approach for fabrication of nanofibers using a high voltage and a fluid flow jet that solidifies into nanofibers on the substrate. The fabricated nanofibers often achieves a large surface area to volume ratio and high porosity, which provides flexibility in terms of surface functionalities, superior mechanical performance and self-standing structures with various levels of doping, which can facilitate their application as electrodes in energy conversion and storage.38,107,108 To date, a variety of fiber materials such as polymers,109,110 carbon materials,111–113 metal oxides,114–116 metal sulfides117–119 and their composites120–123 have been successfully prepared. The morphology and structures of nanofibers are controlled by varying the metal salt precursors and the ratio of chemical salts. With this approach, Zn0.76Co0.24S nanoclusters with N-/S-doped carbon overlayer embedded in the interconnected 1D carbon fibers were prepared by Yin et al.124via electrospinning combined with metal organic framework template, as shown in Fig. 5(a–g). Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) encapsulated Zn0.76Co0.24S@C encapsulated (Zn0.76Co0.24S@C@PAN) nanofibers was prepared using PAN, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and Zn0.76Co0.24S@C. The prepared 1D conductive nanofibers provided an excellent stable electrode structure, and an efficient transport route for electrons, as well as rapid ion diffusion. Recently, Zhong et al.125 found that 3D carbon nanofiber/tin(IV) sulfide (CNF@SnS2) core/sheath fibers can be used as a membrane for photocatalytic reactions. Initially, PAN nanofiber membranes were prepared by electrospinning using precursors of PAN and DMF. The PAN membranes were then carbonized at 500 °C for 2 h and (CNF@SnS2) core/sheath fiber membranes with different SnS2 loadings were fabricated, as shown in Fig. 5(h–n). Similarly, as shown in Fig. 5(o–s), Jagadale et al.126 introduced a combined method of electrospinning and electrodeposition to fabricate CNF@CoNi2S4 porous electrodes with a highly conducting nature.

4.1.3 Lithography. 
Lithography is a versatile strategy toward the fabrication of nanostructured metal sulfides.127–129 The technique has been used to prepare the metal sulfide structures with precision over large areas on a sub-10 nm scale without the need for etching, lift-off or film transfer stages.130 Saifullah et al.131 used electron beam nanolithography with a single source molecular resist to pattern arbitrarily sized and shaped functional ZnS nanostructures, as shown in Fig. 6. In order to enhance the catalytic active sites, Roxlo et al.132 prepared surface defected MoS2 by lithography. As a result, the highly exposed edge surfaces in these layered MoS2 single crystals provided an enhanced catalytic activity. Typically, nanostructured metal sulfide layers have been fabricated by lithographic patterning of self-assembled monolayers or functional surface molecule layers on the substrate through selective film growth or metal sulfide deposition via molecular printing or electron-beam lithography (EBL) techniques.133–135 These approaches are useful to manufacture patterned metal sulfide nanostructures in a small area within a reasonable time scale.

4.1.4 Ball milling. 
In this process, powder particles are exposed to severe mechanical deformation through collisions with stainless steel vessels and balls and become continually deformed, cold welded, and fractured, so that solid-state reactions and/or mechano-chemical reactions in powder blends can be produced. This low-cost and easy scaleable mechano-chemical route136 has been used for fabricating uniform 5 nm sized CuS quantum dots (QDs), as shown in Fig. 7(a and b). The CuS QDs exhibited a high surface area with the existence of dislocations and planar defects such as twins and stacking faults,136 which are beneficial for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic performance. In addition, several nickel sulfide powders of Ni3S2, Ni7S6, NixS6, and Ni3S4 have been prepared using NiS powder by ball milling.137 As shown in Fig. 7(c–e), a highly active electrocatalyst of MoS2 was prepared by Ambrosi et al.138 using MoS2 flakes. The ball-milling process enhanced the electrochemical and electrocatalytic performance of MoS2. In addition, CuCrS2 and NiCr2S4 were also synthesized by mechanical alloying using ball milling technique, as shown in Fig. 7(f and g), and materials were sintered and heat treated to enhance electrical conductivity.139

4.1.5 Exfoliation. 
Several methods of preparing 2D nanosheets of metal sulfides have been prepared for metal sulfides. This technique is similar to graphene exfoliation, simple, low-cost and provides the potential to fabricate high quality 2D metal sulfide materials.
4.1.5.1 Mechanical exfoliation. 
Using this method, MoS2 flakes can be produced on a substrate simply using adhesive tape (‘sticky’ tape). Typically the bulk materials of MoS2 or WS2 were used as the starting material, where parts are peeled off with adhesive tape and pushed into the substrate surface.27,140–143 On release of the tape, a quantity of metal sulfide stays with the substrate, rather than the tape, due to the van der Waals force to the substrate surface. Repeating the process can produce flakes of WS2 or MoS2 with random sizes, shapes and number of layers.144,145 Similarly, Mo1−xWxS2 nanosheets have been obtained on a silica substrate by mechanical exfoliation,146 where a single crystal of Mo1−xWxS2 was used as a starting material. The disadvantage of this method is that the as-exfoliated metal sulfide flakes have to be transferred to a new substrate for further use; it is also a low yield process.
4.1.5.2 Liquid phase exfoliation. 
Liquid phase exfoliation starts from a bulk metal sulfides materials and can manufacture flakes with different shapes, sizes and number of layers.147–150 The yield is considerably higher compared to mechanical exfoliatration, but is typically of lower quality. There are two ways to exfoliate metal sulfides in solution. The first is exfoliation by a mechanical approach such as shearing, sonication, grinding, stirring, and bubbling.147,150–154 Yang et al.155 used starting materials of cadmium acetate, zinc acetate, thioacetamide, selenium, indium chloride and sodium molybdate dehydrate to prepare ZnIn2S4 layers, ZnIn2S4/MoSe2, CdIn2S4, In2S3 layers and hetero-layered CdIn2S4/MoSe2 and In2S3/MoSe2 metal sulfides for hydrogen generation applications. These layers were obtained by a facile low-temperature refluxing method followed by a modest exfoliation, as shown in Fig. 8(a–e), where the precursors of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, InCl3 and thioacetamide were used to produce ZnIn2S4 layers. Initially this precursor solution was prepared in distilled water, which was followed by heating to 95 °C for 5 h. All other materials were prepared by a similar method. For the formation of ZnIn2S4/MoSe2 heterostructures, the negatively charged ZnIn2S4 layers and positively charged MoSe2 promoted surface charge for self-assembly that was driven by strong electrostatic attraction during synthesis. In this fabrication method, some chemical reactions may produce metal sulfide flakes.156–158 For example, surfactants (e.g. chitosan, sodium cholate) may be used in the reaction solution to prevent recombination of exfoliated flakes. In some cases, electrolysis was also employed to generate bubbles to incorporate into the metal sulfide interfaces and exfoliate them. In addition, nanocomposites of MoS2–polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)159 were formed by sonication of MoS2 powder in ethanol with PVP. Compared to tape-assisted mechanical exfoliation, the final quantity of the samples was improved using this method.

Reproduced from ref. 158 with permission from American Chemical Society, copyright 2017. 
A second route is ionic intercalation, where lithium ions are typically used to intercalate between the metal sulfide layers and enlarge the interlayer spacing,160 as shown in Fig. 8(f and g). As an example, Matte et al.161 introduced an ion intercalation method to produce monolayer MoS2 and WS2. Initially, under a nitrogen-filled glove box, MoS2 and/or WS2 powder was mixed with n-butyllithium and hexane, and the precursor was then maintained at 373 K for 72 h. Then, the intercalated samples were sonicated using deionized water under vigorous agitation. It was reported that a violent reaction between the lithium ion intercalated between the layers and water could produce a large amount of hydrogen to expand the layers, and subsequently mono- or few-layer metal sulfides were formed. However, the ion intercalation method is difficult to control and achieve a high yield for single-layered materials.

4.2 Bottom-up strategies
Generally, the bottom-up method refers to the build-up of a nanomaterial atom by atom, molecule by molecule or cluster by cluster. They are now described below.

4.2.1 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD). 
Among the various synthesis techniques, CVD is well suited to existing semiconductor technologies. Normally, this system forms a thin film on a substrate, where chemical reactions are involved in the thin film growth mechanism. For large area MoS2 fabrication, most current research begins with solid state precursors of molybdenum, such as molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) or metal of Mo.162 During this fabrication method, if the precursors of Mo were not vaporized during the process the technique is also called a sulfurization technique where H2S or vaporized S is the sulfur source. It was reported that by using MoCl5 precursors it is easy to achieve monolayers of MoS2 of large area.144,163 Characteristic chemical reactions taking place during the CVD process are: MoO3 + 2H2S + H2 = MoS2 + 3H2O(1) 8MoO3 + 24H2S = 8MoS2 + 24H2O + S8(2) 16MoO3 + 7S8 = 16MoS2 + 24SO2(3)
The usual growth temperatures for CVD are ∼700–1000 °C, and the addition of a metal catalyst, such as Au, is encouraged to attain high quality films.164,165 Recently, the temperature was lowered to 150–300 °C using a plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) technique, thereby making it possible to deposit on plastic and flexible substrates.166,167
Metal–organic CVD (MOCVD) is a special case, where organometallic precursors are used and modern semiconductor industries are preparing single crystal epitaxial films by this method. Recently, this method has been used in the fabrication of MoS2 thin films.93,165,168 Using MOCVD, both MoS2 and WS2 have been fabricated on 4 inch silicon wafers,93 where precursors of molybdenum hexacarbonyl (MHC), tungsten hexacarbonyl (THC), and diethyl sulfide (DES) were used. The addition of H2 gas enhanced the decomposition of diethyl sulfide, and to produce monolayer metal sulfides of only three atoms thick, as shown in Fig. 9. This MOCVD approach for the synthesis of 2D semiconductors undoubtedly opens a new pathway towards creating future robust nano-scale devices based on these materials. The greatest benefit of this method is that precursors of ultrapure gaseous are injected into the reactor chamber to deposit a thin layer of atoms onto the substrate (i.e. atomic layer levels). In addition, if a liquid or solid precursor is used for synthesis, it is vaporized in the MOCVD chamber which improves the quality of films and allows control of the final product. It is well known that Mo1−xWxS2 is a promising 2D ternary system and its monolayer behavior strongly depend on the atomic ratio of Mo/W.169,170 However, at 500 °C MoO3 is partially reduced by sulfur vapor to form volatile MoO3−x, thus MoS2 can be formed at temperatures as low as 530 °C.171 However, WO3 or MoO3−x requires a higher temperature of ∼1000 °C for vaporization.172,173 Thus the preparation of MoO3−xWxS2 monolayers is difficult; although heterostructures of MoS2/WS2 are possible.170 Although monolayer and multi-layered MoO3−xWxS2 metal sulfides were achieved by atomic layer deposition (ALD)174 and other methods,175–177 monolithic MoO3−xWxS2 ternary metal sulfide monolayers with tunable configurations and band gaps have not been reported by conventional CVD methods and are worthy of investigation.

4.2.2 Atomic layer deposition (ALD). 
ALD is a method capable of fabricating a variety of thin films from the vapor phase. This method is a subclass of the CVD technique and the films are grown by exposing the substrate surface to alternating precursors of gas molecules.41,178,179 As an alternative to CVD, ALD is associated with non-overlapping sequential pulses. During each pulse, molecules react with the substrate surface in a self-limiting mode. Therefore, it is a promising approach to produce materials with layer-by-layer precision. Recently, ALD has been used to grow monolayer and few-layer MoS2 on SiO2/Si or other substrates180–182 using precursors of vaporized MoCl5 and H2S. The thickness and composition of monolayer to few-layer MoS2 or WS2 or other sulfide materials can be adjusted by regulating the film deposition time and pulsing fraction.
ALD of FeSx prepared from bis(N,N′-di-tert-butylacetamidinato)iron(II) and H2S on a silica substrate using a home-built ALD reactor has been recently reported.183 However, compared to the wealth of literature on metal oxide fabrication by ALD, only a limited number of metal sulfide materials have been studied to date, including AlS,184 CuxS,185 CoS,186 BaS,187 CdS,188,189 CaS,190 SrS,191 In2S3,192 PbS,193 and heterostructures such as ZnS/SnS2/Cu2S/Si194 and Cu2ZnSnS4.195 Finally, in order to enhance the quality of the films formed by ALD, several samples were annealed in a sulfur environment, such as H2S or S atmospheres.


4.2.3 Spray pyrolysis. 
Spray pyrolysis is a rapid and relatively low-cost technique, which has been widely used to produce large area metal sulfide thin films, as shown in Fig. 10. Using this technique, metal sulfides which include ZnS,196,197 SnS,198 CdS,199 CuS,200 CdZnS201 and CuInS2,202,203 and their composites, were fabricated at moderate temperatures below 400 °C with good adhesion to the substrate. In particular, ways to tailor the thin film quality include the growth temperature, the molar ratio between metal (M) precursor and sulfur precursor in the precursor spray solution (i.e. M:S) and the use of post-deposition annealing. Recently, cubic nanocrystalline Co3S4 was prepared by spray pyrolysis using cobalt chloride and thiourea as the precursors.204 A possible reaction scheme is as follows: (4) (5) (6)
 Fig. 10  Common processing strategy for spray pyrolysis. 
Lee et al.205 prepared pristine nickel sulfide and nickel sulfide–rGO composite powders by a one-pot spray pyrolysis from spray solutions without post heat treatment. For nickel sulfide–rGO composites, the colloidal precursor solution contained dispersed graphene oxide with nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2) and thiourea ((NH2)2CS) in specific molar ratios. The nickel sulfide–rGO composites exhibited a uniform distribution of nickel sulfide nanocrystals within the highly conductive rGO matrix with well-developed mesopores and structural stability from electrochemical analysis.


4.2.4 Pulsed laser deposition/ablation. 
Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a physical vapor deposition (PVD) method. In contrast to CVD, the benefits of using PLD are cost-effectiveness, high growth rate, good control of morphology and thickness, low growth temperature, and its ability to fabricate versatile materials, specifically for those with chemical active surface areas.206,207 In addition, it is relatively easy to fabricate nanocomposites using the PLD method, since it is possible to simultaneously use several target materials inside the PLD chamber. Compared to other PVD methods, such as thermal evaporation and sputtering, the PLD technique has specific features208,209 which include (i) synthesis via a pulsed mode, so that a small amount of material can be grown in microseconds, and (ii) the target has fast and strong heating features, hence stoichiometric growth can be readily attained using PLD. In this aspect, Serrao et al.210 prepared highly crystalline thin films of MoS2 using PLD; MoS2 thin films have been grown on aluminium oxide (Al2O3)(0001), gallium nitride (GaN)(0001) and silicon carbide-6H (SiC-6H)(0001) substrates. One-inch diameter targets were prepared by cold isostatic pressing of MoS2 and sulfur powder with varying Mo to S atomic ratios. The targets were placed 5 cm away from single-side polished Al2O3(0001), GaN(0001), and SiC-6H(0001) substrates. A circular mask and UV transparent lens (focal length of 16.5 cm) were used to focus the beam to a 4 mm2 spot on the target substrate surface. The laser source was a pulsed KrF excimer 248 nm laser operating at a 30 ns pulse width with a replication rate of 4 Hz. The laser energy was ∼50 mJ per pulse and the substrate temperature was 700 °C. The chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 10−6 Torr and the ablation was 0.1 mTorr. Moreover, PLD was employed to fabricate MoS2 films with sulfur defects, which were the defects created by the bombardment of the energetic large particles generated from the pulsed laser. However, it should be noted that the defects are prominent when the growth temperature was less than 300 °C. Theoretical estimates indicated that sulfur defects in MoS2 can reduce the band gap of few-layer MoS2 from 1.08 eV to 0.08 eV, which makes it applicable for fabricating saturable absorber devices.
In addition, a thin film of Ag coated on a silicon substrate was used to fabricate high quality WS2 films due to appropriate lattice matching of Ag2S formation at the interface.211,212 Bo et al.213 fabricated MoS2 quantum dots by a temporally shaped femto-second laser ablation method, as shown in Fig. 11(a). In order to prepare the MoS2 QD, an amplified titanium sapphire laser system was used to generate linearly polarized laser pulses. Ettlinger et al.214 used laser wavelength varied PLD deposition of copper tin sulfide and SnS-rich copper tin sulfide with a 248 nm KrF excimer laser with a pulse length τ = 20 ns and a 355 nm frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser at pulse length τ = 6 ns. This comparative study of laser wavelength showed that the copper tin sulfide film growth rate per pulse for a 248 nm laser was three to four times lower than the 355 nm laser, as shown in Fig. 11(b–d).

4.2.5 Thermal deposition. 
Thermal evaporation is one of the simplest techniques of PVD. Shimizu et al.215 used thermal evaporation to synthesize gold (Au) mediated hexagonal wurtzite structured zinc sulfide (ZnS) nanostructures including nanobelts, nanosheets, and nanorods, as shown in Fig. 12(a–f). Before deposition, a sapphire(0001) substrate was coated with a 70 nm thick Au film, whereas, ZnS powder was used as a starting material to fabricate a variety of structures. A high-purity inert Ar carrier gas was purged and during deposition the furnace temperature was raised and maintained under a pressure of 350 to 400 Torr. As a result, a highly crystalline ZnS was achieved. In addition, several nanostructures including ZnS nanowire (NW) arrays,216 CdS NW's,217 and ZnS:Ga nanowalls46,216 have been formed. A one-step thermal evaporation synthesis of ZnO–ZnS heterostructure NW arrays was also carried out using ZnS powders,218 as shown in Fig. 12(g and h). Microscopic analysis revealed the ZnO NWs were grown on top of the ZnS NWs through epitaxial growth, and the epitaxial correlation of ZnO and ZnS was (0001)ZnO//(0001)ZnS, (01−10)ZnO//(01−10)ZnS, and (2−1−10)ZnO//(2−1−10)ZnS. Furthermore, ZnS NW arrays were formed by etching ZnO–ZnS NW arrays with KOH solution. Single-crystalline nanowires of CoxZn1−xS with a variety of cobalt doping levels were also prepared by thermal evaporation using different volumes of CoCl2·6H2O powders as the dopant source.219 Huang et al.220 fabricated highly stable single crystalline wurtzite structured ZnO/zinc blende ZnS co-axial heterojunctions. During fabrication, the deposition temperature was responsible for the final crystalline phase of ZnS. Due to its wurtzite structure, the ZnO nanorods have hexagonal cross-sections, as shown in Fig. 12(i–u). In addition, voids were observed to form between the ZnO core and the ZnS shell during the coating process, which may be due to the Kirkendall effect. Moreover, a zinc blende of single crystalline ZnS nanotubes orientated along the [001] direction was obtained by etching ZnO/ZnS heterojunctions in acetic acid. A variety of nanostructures have also been prepared based on mono-metal sulfide221,222 and bi-metal sulfides.223,224

4.2.6 Combustion. 
The combustion method is a rapid synthesis method that utilizes exothermic reactions to increase the reaction rate; it is also referred to as self-propagating high-temperature synthesis. In this aspect, Mani et al.225 produced CdS by the combustion method. The precursor contained cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate and thiourea. Combustion dehydration was achieved using a preheated furnace at 300 °C, and dissimilar oxidant/fuel (O/F) ratios (1, 2, 3, 4 and 10). Hosny et al.226 prepared CdS, SnS2 and HgS by the self-propagating combustion method. Nanoparticles of metals sulfides were manufactured by combustion of the as-prepared precursors (i.e. M(II) chloride where M = Cd, Sn and Hg and calcium thioacetate for sulfur source) on a hot plate. During the reaction, the decomposition metal thioacetate leads to the formation of CO2 and S2−. The redox reaction between S2− and CO2 is known to be a self-propagating exothermic reaction and the metal sulfide formation reactions are: (7) 2M–S–CH2− + 3O2 → 2H2S + 2CO2 + 2MO(8) 2H2S + CO2 → 2S + C + hν(9) 2MO + 2S + C → 2MS + CO2(10)where M = Cd2+, Sn2+ and Hg2+.
Using a similar approach, CdS nanowires,227 rGO/CdS nanocomposites,228 Mn2+ doped ZnS,229 Mn2+ doped CuS230 nanocrystallites and Zn1−xCdxS nanoparticles231 were also prepared. The combustion technique has a number of benefits, such as the low processing time, high purity of products, low external energy consumption, and high yield of fine particles. However, the application of combustion for the preparation of metal sulfides is not fully explored and is worthy of further examination.


4.2.7 Micro-emulsion. 
Typically, a micro-emulsion system consists of three components232 which include a polar phase (such as water), a non-polar phase (usually a hydrocarbon liquid or oil) and a surfactant. In this technique, two routes are possible.233,234 The first route is a micro-emulsion system, which is diffusion controlled since the trigger/reactant must diffuse over the interfacial wall of the micro-emulsion to encapsulate the first reactant to complete the nanostructure synthesis. The second route is the use of two micro-emulsions, whereby separate reactants are mixed together in appropriate ratios to complete the reactions. Zhang et al.235 prepared large quantities of CuS nanotubes by the micro-emulsion system under low temperature; the as-prepared nanotubes on a modified electrode were used as a glucose sensor. In this micro-emulsion system, oleic acid was used as a core and water as a shell and nanostructure growth was controlled by changing the reaction temperature. In a similar approach, CdS was produced in sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate and Triton reverse micelles with cadmium lauryl sulphate and cadmium sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate as the functional surfactant.236 The particle diameter was dependent on the relative composition of Cd2+ and S2− ions. In addition, the micro-emulsion method has also been used to synthesize semiconducting metal sulfides such as PbS,237 Cu2S,238 and composites of CdS–TiO2,239,240 CdS–ZnS,241–243 CdS–SnO2.244,245


4.2.8 Precipitation. 
Precipitation is the creation of nanostructured materials as a powdered solid from a solution.246,247 Using this technique it is possible to select the reaction conditions where a chemical substance precipitates in a highly pure and easily separable form. The common precipitates used to prepare sulfide materials are KOH, NaOH, ammonia, sodium dodecyl sulfate, NaHCO3, urea and tetramethylammonium hydroxide. In addition to the precipitants, several reductive and oxidative agents are often added to form the final materials.248 Finally, the precipitated materials can be heat treated by calcination or annealing to form metal sulfides. Vacassy et al.246 synthesized ZnS powders in aqueous solution by reacting different zinc salts with S2− anions generated by thermal decomposition of thioacetamide under acidic pH conditions salts. They indicated that nucleation was improved by acetic acid, however restricted particle growth was observed. Vattikuti et al.249 synthesized MoS2 nanorods through a precipitation method using precursors of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate and ammonium sulfide, where the citric acid was acted as a reductant. In a similar approach, the kinetics of Fe2S precipitation using a constant super saturation solution was explained by Rickard.250 The reaction mechanism for the precipitation reaction between Fe(II) and dissolved sulfide are: M2+ + H2S → MS(solid) + 2H+(11) M2+ + 2HS− → M(HS)2(solid)(12) M(HS)2(solid) → MS(s) + H2S(13)where M = metal ion. During these reactions, the reaction rates are direct functions of dissolved Fe(II) activity. Moreover, the pH effect of copper sulfide nanoparticles during synthesis was investigated by Yadav et al.251 in which copper acetate and sodium thiosulfate was used as a starting material. A solution of ammonia and dilute HCl were used to tune the pH of the precursor. Initially, at a pH = 5.5 CuS nano-particles were formed and the particle size reduced as the pH was increased; the structural variations with pH are shown in Fig. 13. Later, Zhang et al.252 used Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O and Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O to prepare Cd1−xZnxS using a precipitation method by slowly adding Na2S into the aqueous reaction solution. Recently, Jiang et al.253 prepared a g-C3N4–CdS photocatalyst using g-C3N4, CdCl2, a Na2S solution and NaOH. During synthesis, the samples with varied g-C3N4 and CdS ratios (1:5, 1:3, 1:2 and 1:1) were prepared. As a result g-C3N4–CdS was prepared with a ratio of 1:3, which exhibited a highly porous nature with enhanced photocatalytic activity. Chen and Ye254 prepared low band gap (1.7 eV) AgIn5S8 metal sulfide using AgNO3 and In(NO3)3 and Na2S; initially a brown Ag–In–S precursor was precipitated by the addition of Na2S aqueous solution. In a similar way, highly active bi-metallic sulfide silver tetrathiotungstate (Ag2WS4) electrocatalysts was prepared by Zhan et al.255

4.2.9 Hydrothermal synthesis. 
The hydrothermal technique is one of the best methods to produce a variety of pure and nanostructured materials with desired properties. This method is widely used to fabricate nanoparticles of metal sulfides, and their composites with control over the structural, chemical, physical and optical features of the particles by changing the properties of near or supercritical solutions using different pressure and temperature conditions.38,256,257 The hydrothermal system typically uses precursors of metal salts to allow a reaction with the sulfide source materials or simply sulfur in a stainless steel autoclave, where a sequence of physicochemical reactions take place under moderate to high temperatures (e.g., ∼80–200 °C). The resultant products are metal sulfide powders of different shapes and sizes. The prepared nano-sized powders are often post-annealed at high-temperature to increase their crystalline quality and purity. Li et al.258 prepared a series of metal sulfide dendrites of PbS, CdS, ZnS, CoS, Cu2S via a facile hydrothermal method using metal acetates and 1-butyl-3-methlyimidazole thiocyanate ([BMIM][SCN]), and during synthesis [BMIM][SCN] acted as both a sulfur source and capping agent. As shown in Fig. 14(a–d), Dong et al.259 prepared hierarchical CoS nanostructures by a facile one-pot simple hydrothermal method. In a typical procedure, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and thiourea were dissolved in deionized water and/or ethanol, then placed into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, followed by a heat temperature. During synthesis thiourea provides two roles. Firstly, it was decomposed to produce S2− for the final formation of CoS. Secondly, it served as a structural directing agent to control CoS crystalline growth. The morphologies of the structures formed were modified by fine-tuning the molar ratio of the reactants and solvents, reaction time, reaction temperature, and ligand type. The formation mechanism of CoS nanostructures during a hydrothermal reaction is closely related to the reaction between Co2+, H2O and SC(NH2)2 and are as follows: SC(NH2)2 + 2H2O → H2S + 2NH3 + CO2(14) Co2+ + NH3 → [Co(NH3)4]2+(15) NH3 + H2O → OH− + NH4+(16) H2S + 2OH− → S2− + 2H2O(17) [Co(NH3)4]2+ + S2− → CoS + NH3(18)

A flower-like CoS nanostructured growth mechanism involved three stages (i) the formation of nanoflakes, (ii) skeleton sphere formation by attachment of small-sized nanoflakes via an Ostwald ripening mechanism, and (iii) the development of the hierarchical flower-like nanostructures via a dissolution–recrystallization process. Similarly, by using CoCl2·6H2O with citric acid monohydrate (CAM) and ethanolamine (ETA), Xing et al.260 prepared three different morphologies of hierarchical CoS2 nanostructures, where carbon disulfide (CS2) was used as a sulfur source.
MoS2 nanostructures and its reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid composite were produced by Kamila et al.261 The raw materials of ammonium heptamolybdate, polyethylene glycol and thiourea were used as the Mo and S source to prepare 2D nanosheet structured MoS2–rGO hybrids. Due to the structural features of the rGO/MoS2 nanosheets, it exhibited excellent electrochemical HER performance. In addition, uniform MnCO3 microcubes were decorated with nanosheets of MoS2 by a L-cysteine assisted hydrothermal method.262 Through a hydrothermal procedure, the MnCO3 templates were converted to MnS to form MnS@MoS2 microcubes. After selective removal of the MnS microcube templates by HCl washing, hierarchical MoS2 microboxes were obtained, as shown in Fig. 14(e–k). Subsequently, after annealing at high temperature in an inert atmosphere, highly crystalline MoS2 microboxes were obtained. A simple approach was used to fabricate flower-like Bi2S3 metal sulfide263 using L-cysteine, and amino acid, as shown in Fig. 14(l and m). In addition, other Bi2S3 nanostructures such as nanorod bundles, nanoflakes, network-like nanoflakes, and nanorods have been prepared by tailoring the reaction solution pH, the reaction temperature, and the Bi(NO3)3 to L-cysteine ratio. This morphology had a significant effect on the electrochemical HER reaction.
Recently, a two-step hydrothermal method was used to fabricate ZnFe2O4–ZnIn2S4 composites with different mass fractions.264 Initially ZnFe2O4 was prepared using Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O in absolute ethanol by a hydrothermal technique at 180 °C for 12 h. The precursor solution was then prepared using ZnFe2O4 in ethylene glycol, and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, In(NO3)3·4.5H2O and L-cysteine was added in the solution and heated at 150 °C for 12 h. Interestingly, the specific surface areas were improved after the ZnFe2O4 was doped in ZnIn2S4 at mass ratios from 1 to 5 wt%, which may due to the sphere-like structure and reduced crystalline nature of the ZnIn2S4. A nanocomposite of g-C3N4/nanocarbon/ZnIn2S4 (CN/C/ZIS) was prepared by the hydrothermal method.265 The nanocarbon which connects both the CN and ZIS exhibited a low crystalline nature, as shown in Fig. 14(o and p). The nanocarbon can be used as an electron mediator and may enhance the electrical conductivity, which can assist in effective electron hole pair separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers.
In order to utilize the full structural features of metal sulfides, several types of conducting substrates including fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass, carbon cloth (CC), graphene and conductive polymers, have been used in hydrothermal method to coat or create metal sulfides. The use of a conductive substrate assists in electron transfer and stabilizes the nanostructures. As shown in Fig. 15(i), a three-dimensional, ternary CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterojunction on a FTO substrate was formed via a simple three-step hydrothermal method.266 Initially, titanium butoxide mixed with hydrochloric acid and distilled water precursor was used to create the TiO2 surface on the FTO glass substrate. Secondly, the precursor of ZnSO4·7H2O, InCl3·4H2O, and C2H5NS were used to fabricate the ZnIn2S4 on the TiO2/FTO surface by a similar approach. For ternary heterojunction of CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2/FTO fabrication, the cadmium nitrate tetra-hydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O) and thiourea were used. As a result, the prepared heterojunction films were used as a highly efficient, visible light-active photoanodes for PEC water splitting.

Zhu et al.267 prepared hierarchical CuS ultrafine nanoneedle arrays on a carbon nanotube (CNT) backbone (CNT@CuS). Initially, the functionalized CNTs were coated with a mesoporous silica layer to stimulate the growth of 1D Cu–silicate core–shell nanostructures on CNT@SiO2. Finally, the copper silicate nanoneedles were transformed into CuS nanoneedles through a hydrothermal method with Na2S. In addition, the fabrication of nickel sulfide hierarchical structures was achieved using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as a chelating and capping agent using nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) and thiourea (CH4N2S) as precursors during hydrothermal treatment.268 The influence of precursor materials concentration (i.e. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, CH4N2S, and EDTA) on the growth mechanism of nickel sulfide structures and phase control was investigated. As shown in Fig. 15(ii), there are four different phases in the synthesized products with respect to the concentration. In a similar approach, metallic CoS2 nanocube growth and amorphous MoS2 nanosheet coating was performed via a hydrothermal method269 to obtain a CoS2@MoS2 hierarchical nanoarray. The hydrothermal treatment involved a precursor of CoCl2 and (NH4)6Mo7O24 on a titanium substrate, with thiourea (CS(NH2)2) being used as the sulfur source. Composites of MoS2/montmorillonite (MMT) nanosheets were synthesized by Peng et al.270 Initially, a natural clay mineral (MMT) was dispersed in aqueous solution with Na2MoO4 and H2NCSNH2 as the precursor material. The MoO42− anion could not be adsorbed on the MMT surface due to the presence of negative surface charges; however, the thiourea molecules were adsorbed on the surface of MMT via amidogen. Under a hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C for 24 h, the thiourea decomposed and attached on the surface of MMT. The subsequent nucleation and growth of MoS2 nanosheets progressed in situ with the MMT sheets acting as templates. Finally, MoS2/MMT composite nanosheets were successfully grown which exhibited a high BET specific surface area and total pore volume of ∼72.10 m2 g−1 and ∼0.1206 cm3 g−1, respectively; this high surface area and small pore structure provided increased adsorption and reactive sites which were beneficial for catalytic and photocatalytic reactions.
For core–shell structure formation, Au nanopolyhedrons were dispersed in cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB).271 Under a hydrothermal treatment at 140 °C for 3 h, metal thiobenzoates were decomposed and provided sulfur for Ag+ or Cu2+ ions to form sulfides. The resultant Ag2S or CuS were tightly bound to Au nanocrystals owing to the similarity in the chemical properties between Cu, Ag, and Au. They acted as a wetting layer for the deposition of other metal sulfides that were created hydrothermally from the consistent thiobenzoates. The function of Ag2S or CuS as a wetting layer was attributed to the partial cation exchange between the different metal sulfides, as shown in Fig. 15(iii). Recently, Yu et al.272 prepared NiCo2S4 on a nickel foam by a hydrothermal method using precursor materials of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and thiourea, where the Ni to Co ratio was 1:2; and for comparison various concentrations were used. X-ray diffraction revealed a low crystallinity, structural disorder and enhanced defect sites in the NiCo2S4, which can enhance electrocatalytic activity. Highly active nanorods of NiCo2S4 were prepared with Ni(OAc)2·4H2O, Co(OAc)2·4H2O and thiourea as the source of Ni, Co and S, whereas water/ethylene glycol was used as the solvent, and the reaction temperature was 160 °C.273 In addition, Mei et al.274 prepared mushroom-like CoNi2S4 arrays for energy applications and hydrothermally prepared cubes and/or flower-like α-MnS and γ-MnS have been produced and are of interest of energy materials.275–277
Porous and heterostructured materials have recently received increased attention for energy conversion and storage, since porous structures offer an exceptionally large reactive surface area and metal sulfides with hybrid structures have improved electron transfer mechanisms. MnS decorated N–S co-doped rGO were prepared by Liu et al.278 They used raw materials of graphene oxide (GO), thiourea, manganese acetate tetrahydrate with a processing temperature of 180 °C for 20 h, followed by annealing in Ar at 600 °C for 4 h. In addition, a rGO/MnS nanotube hybrid structure was prepared using source materials of GO, MnCl2·4H2O and Na2S279 at a reaction temperature of ∼120 °C for 12 h. The prepared material was subsequently reduced using sodium borohydride, which significantly enhanced the conductive nature of the rGO/MnS nanotubes. In a similar approach, GO anchored porous MnS nanocrystals were prepared by Tang et al.280 The MnS/GO-NH3 sample exhibited a high surface area of (∼44.8 m2 g−1) with exceptional electrochemical behaviour. Highly porous nanoflakes of In2S3 was prepared281 using the raw materials of In(NO3)3 and glutathione (GSH), and a pH conditioner of urea was added, with a reaction temperature of 160 °C for 12 h. Recently, a one pot hydrothermal method has been used to prepare hierarchical Bi2S3/In2S3 core/shell structured microspheres.282 The source materials of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, poly (sodium-p-styrenesulfonate) (PSS), In(NO3)3·4.5H2O and L-cysteine with a processing temperature of 150 °C for 9 h.


4.2.10 Solvothermal synthesis. 
For the solvothermal method, the synthesis approach is similar to the hydrothermal approach except that an organic solution is used, instead of water, as the precursor medium. In addition, the reaction temperature is above the critical point of the solvent and therefore the pressure is high.283,284 2D materials have been extensively investigated due to their exceptional features, such as high surface area, and abundant surface sites. Recently, a temperature effect on the structural modification of CoS hierarchitectures has been investigated by Wang et al.285 They attained a variety of flower-like structures using raw materials of CoCl2·6H2O and thioacetamide (TAA) as the precursors, and the only varied factor was temperature, as shown in Fig. 16(a–h). In addition, FeS needles were synthesized by the decomposition of a [Fe3(μ3-O)(μ2-O2CCH2Cl)6(H2O)3]NO3·H2O precursor complex with thiourea at 150 °C for 12 h for solvothermal synthesis.286 Similarly, orthorhombic structured Bi2S3 nanorods were prepared using Bi particles and Na2S2O3 as source materials.287 The morphology transformation from Bi particles to Bi2S3 nanorods was achieved via the solvothermal method. The solvents of EtOH/EDA/H2O were used as the reaction medium. Likewise, NiCl2·6H2O, sulfur and glycol was used to fabricate cubic pyrite of NiS2 dodecahedrons at 200 °C for 6 h.288 Recently, Huang et al.289 prepared hierarchical core-branch Al-doped nanosheets of cobalt sulfide attached on nickel nanotube arrays combined with a carbon cloth for electrochemical energy storage applications.

Moreover, the use of the solvothermal method with a dissimilar reaction time was reported for the synthesis of nano-rods of SnS using precursors of stannous chloride (SnCl2:H2O), sodium sulfide (Na2S) and the solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).290 The prepared solution was solvothermally heated at 200 °C for 15, 30, 40 and 48 h. As a result of the optimum reaction times, the SnS nanorods exhibited a highly crystalline nature, as shown in Fig. 17(i). Subsequently, two new layered bi-metallic sulfides of (Haep)2·Ga2Sb2S7 and Mn2(phen)Sb2S5 were prepared by Lin et al.291 The structure of (Haep)2·Ga2Sb2S7 consisted of GaS4 tetrahedra and SbS3 trigonal pyramids and had a layered structure with 8-membered-ring windows. Also, the Mn2(phen)Sb2S5 had a neutral layered structure which comprised of infinite Mn–S sheets. The organic species were attached directly to the atoms of Mn within the layers by covalent bonds and protruded into the interlayer section; where aep = 1-2-aminoethylpiperazine and phen = 1,10-phenanthroline. Likewise, large surface area nanosheets of NaInS2 were prepared via a solvothermal method292 using a precursor of InCl3 and Na2S·2H2O, and absolute ethanol. In a similar way, Cu–NaInS2 nanosheets were also prepared by the same group. In addition, flower-like nanostructures of Sb2−xBixS3 were prepared by Sun et al.293 through varying the concentration of precursors of antimony diethyldithiocarbamate [Sb(DDTC)3] and bismuth diethyldithiocarbamate [Bi(DDTC)3] in the ratio of x = 0.4 and 1.0. As a result, flower-like architectures with an average diameter of ∼4 μm were formed that were composed of single-crystalline nanorods with orthorhombic structures.

Tu et al.294 developed a one-pot solvothermal synthesis method to fabricate ZnIn2S4 on a Zn substrate without any template or surfactant, where thioacetamide was the sulfur source. During synthesis, intermediate nanowires of indium were initially created which acted as a self-sacrificial template for the development of ZnIn2S4 microwires. The pristine ZnIn2S4 microwires were made by vertical nanosheets, and were controlled by the duration of the reaction time, as shown in Fig. 17(ii). The proposed nucleation growth conditions are below, Zn + In3+ → Zn2+ + In(19) CH3CSNH2 + H2O → CH3CONH2 + H2S(20) H2S → S2− + H+(21) Zn2+ In3+ + S2− → ZnxInySz(22)
It was reported that, a small amount of three ions (In3+, Zn2+ and S2−) created in the solution combine together in situ to produce shell compounds of ZnxInySz. The ZnIn2S4 exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity towards organic pollutant degradation. NiCo2S4 was also prepared using the polyvinylpyrrolidone, cobalt acetate and nickel acetate with ethanol solution,295 whereas, thioacetamide (TAA) was used as a sulfur source.
Metal sulfides with graphene or heterostructures are a potential favorable electrode material for energy conversion and storage applications. In this regard, Wang et al.296 used a single step solvothermal method using a poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) additive to synthesise well-dispersed nickel–cobalt sulfide nanoparticles on graphene. The raw materials of Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O, Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O and PAA with a molar ratio of 1:2:2.8 dissolved with 0.5 mg mL−1 GO suspension in ethylene glycol (EG), where thiourea was used as a sulfur source. After mixing, the precursor was heated to 200 °C for 10 h; the final products and synthesis method are presented in Fig. 18. For a comparative analysis, nickel–cobalt sulfide@graphene and the nickel–cobalt sulfide (Ni–Co–S) samples were prepared in a similar way. In addition, MoS2 attached to a rGO/MoS2 hybrid41 was produced using (NH4)2MoS4 and hydrazine in a DMF solution with graphene oxide at 200 °C. During this preparation, the precursor of (NH4)2MoS4 was reduced to MoS2 on the surface of rGO, which was created via the reduction of GO by hydrazine. Li et al.297 prepared hybrid of SnS NS/rGO using ethylene glycol solution and citric acid with raw materials of SnCl2·2H2O and (NH3)2S. Li et al.298 synthesized highly conductive hierarchy structured Co1/3Mo2/3S2/graphene, the precursors of CoC4H6O4·4H2O and Na2MoO4·2H2O and sulfur were dissolved in ethylene glycol and vigorously stirred with GO to form a homogeneous solution. The addition of Co exposed its role in achieving enhanced electronic conductivity, easing ion diffusion by decreasing the thickness of the nanosheets, and reducing the aggregation of Co1/3Mo2/3S2/graphene.

Ding et al.299 reported a one-step high-temperature hydrated-sulfate aided solvothermal method to prepare nanocomposite spheres of TiO2/CdS, TiO2/Cu2S, TiO2/FeS, TiO2/Co9S8, and TiO2/ZnS, where they used the maximum temperature of 350 °C. The TiO2/CdS nanocomposite exhibited outstanding photocatalytic efficiency due to its active hetero-interface and highly crystalline nature. By using the mineralizer of thiophenol, Yao et al.300 prepared silver antimony sulfides. KAg2SbS3 was synthesized by a reaction of K2CO3, AgNO3, Sb2S3, and S in a mixed solvent of thiophenol/pyridine and ethylenediamine (EDA). Secondly, the K2Ag3Sb3S7 was synthesized by the reaction of K2CO3, AgSPh, and Sb2S3 in a mixed solvent of glycol/pyridine and EDA. KAg2SbS3 revealed a hexagonal net structure produced by condensation of rings of six-membered Ag2SbS3. These sheets are linked through Ag–S bonds to create double layers. K2Ag3Sb3S7 consisted of infinite (Sb2S4)2− chains and (Ag6Sb2S10)∞8− columns linked to form layers, as shown in Fig. 16(i and j).


4.2.11 Sulfidation. 
The fabrication of metal sulfides is a crucial step to obtain highly active sulfide catalysts, since it transforms from the catalytically inactive metal oxide phase into an active sulfide phase. There have been several reports highlighting the importance of sulfide based nanoparticle transformations.301–304 However, some nanostructures continue to suffer from attachment of the sulfur to its host lattice. Sulfidation is a method of fixing sulfide ions in a host material or molecule. This technique has been recently widely used to convert metal oxides to metal sulfides, but is also related to surface modification of the final product. Typically, sulfidation can be executed using the direct addition of H2S or a combination of H2S; generally 10–15%, v/v in hydrogen.304 Single-crystalline iron pyrite (FeS2) nanorods, nanobelts, and nanoplates have been manufactured via a sulfidation reaction with iron dichloride (FeCl2), iron dibromide (FeBr2) and sulfur powder at high temperatures (≥450 °C).305 The same research group have fabricated single-crystalline FeS2 nanowires via thermal sulfidation of steel foil.306 Recently, Li et al.307 prepared nanoparticles of ZnS decorated on a nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) polyhedral structure. In this work a zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) was used as the precursor over successive carbonization and sulfidation processes, as shown in Fig. 19(i). The resulting ZnS/NPC features exhibited a regular polyhedral morphology with a porous structure, high specific surface area, and a nitrogen-doped conductive carbonaceous network, offering a high conductivity and stability.

To fabricate MoS2, the effect of the degree of sulfidation on MoO3 was reported by Bara et al.308 It was observed that the degree of sulfidation depended on the surface orientation of the α-Al2O3 substrate. In order to execute sulfidation, 15 mol% H2S/H2 gas phase sulfidation was performed with MoO3. The degree of sulfidation, i.e. the relative contribution of MoS2 to the total involvement of Mo, was determined at different sulfidation temperatures, as shown in Fig. 19(ii-a and b). As a result, a maximum degree of sulfidation was ∼90% at a low temperature of 300 °C for the C (0 0 0 1) plane, with a larger MoS2 slab size as shown in Fig. 19(ii: c). The degree of sulfidation influenced the surface morphology of the final MoS2 and WS2 particles and the way in which promoters were incorporated at the edges for MoS2 and WS2-based metal sulfides. In addition, at low temperatures the sulfidation of hematite (α-Fe2O3) NW arrays with H2S resulted in the formation of highly oriented FeS nanotubes.309 Likewise, three types of metal sulfides such as pyrrhotite (Fe1−xS), Co1−xS and α-MnS nanocrystals were prepared by Chen et al.310via sulfidation. Initially the oxides of Fe, Co and Mn nanoparticles were prepared, and then sulfur powder with ∼1.5 equivalents of MnO, FeO and CoO was added to the nanoparticle suspension solution. As a result, hollow structures of Fe1−xS, MnS and Co1−xS nanoparticles were formed with diameters of ∼26.8 ± 1.5 nm, 26.8 ± 1.5 nm and 16.5 ± 2.3 nm respectively. It was stated that, sulfur atoms attaching to the surface of the nanoparticles could promote the formation of vacancy defects. This can lead to an increase of vacancies in the form of voids in the center or on the surface of nanoparticles; this may be the reason for the formation of hollow structures.
Recently, Ag2S was prepared from synthetic Ag-NPs reacted with Na2S, which revealed substantial alterations in aggregation state, surface properties, surface charge, and dissolution rates. In order to investigate the controlled formation of Ag2S, the Na2S to Ag-NPs ratio was varied.311 It was proposed that part of the Ag2S was amorphous. Chen et al.312 prepared Ag2S by sulfidation reaction between silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and sulfide species as below: 4Ag + O2 + 2H2S → 2Ag2S + 2H2O(23) 4Ag + O2 + 2HS− → 2Ag2S + 2OH−(24) 4Ag + O2 + 2H2O + 2S2− → 2Ag2S + 4OH−(25)
In order to attain CuS nanoparticles, sulfidation of CuO nanoparticles was conducted by Ma et al.313 During synthesis, dispersed CuO nanoparticles (100 mg L−1) in 10 mM sodium nitrate (NaNO3) were reacted with sulfide (Na2S) in N2-purged 50 mL propylene Falcon tubes. The molar ratio of S/Cu was varied from 0.21 to 2.16 to examine the properties of sulfidized nanoparticles to different extents. The sulfidation of CuO was as below: 8CuO + 5S2− + 8H+ = 4Cu2S + SO42− + 4H2O(26) CuO + S2− + 2H+ = CuS + H2O(27) 8Cu2+ + 5S2− + 4H2O = 4Cu2S + SO42− + 8H+(28) Cu2+ + S2− = CuS(29)

Eqn (26) and (28) are redox reactions in which Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I) while S(−II) in sulfide is oxidized to S(VI) in sulfate. However, eqn (27) and (29) are not redox reactions. The normal Gibbs free energy of reaction of eqn (26) and (27) are −1432 kJ mol−1 and −246.8 kJ mol−1, respectively. For eqn (27) reaction conditions,  specifying a spontaneous reaction. Therefore, the formation of CuS and Cu2S are thermodynamically favorable by the above reactions.
It is well known that, phase transfer methods hold extraordinary benefits for the synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials. Recently, Pt coupled CuS heterodimers were prepared by Ding et al.314 where the heterostructured Pt/CuS NPs were synthesized by use of Cu–Pt alloy nanoparticles with a sulfur source of oleamine and its subsequent phase segregation, as shown in Fig. 19(iii). These results specify that temperature and the reactivity of the sulfur source hold key roles in the sulfidation of Cu in a Cu–Pt alloy. The same group also reported a Au–Cu2S alloy formed by a similar approach.315 Recently, ZnO sulfidation with sulfur and iron oxide at high temperatures was investigated by Han et al.316 Zinc oxide (ZnO), sulfur, and Fe2O3 were used as raw materials to fabricate metal sulfides, as shown in Fig. 19(iv), and the growth behavior of both ZnS and FeS at high temperatures were systematically studied. The sulfidation behavior of zinc, phase transformations, morphology changes, and surface properties were also investigated. One dimensional ZnO–ZnS core–shell nanofibers were also formed using the precursors of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), zinc acetate dehydrate and thioacetamide.317 Initially, fibers of ZnO were prepared by electrospinnng, then the surface of the ZnO nanofibers were converted into a shell layered ZnS via sulfidation, and the increased sulfidation time enhanced visible absorption behavior. Similarly, ZnS–ZnO nanocomposites were fabricated by the solvothermal method, followed by the partial sulfidation of ZnO at low temperatures.318
In addition to the above morphologies, yolk–shell,319 nanobubble,320 hollow and hierarchical features321,322 offer advantages for building progressive materials for green energy applications. Recently, Heift et al.323 prepared iron sulfide nanoflakes by sulfidation of 9 nm zerovalent iron nanoparticles with H2S using the precursor of bis[bis(trimethylsilyl)amido]iron(II). The iron sulfide flakes formed consisted of Fe2S2 and Fe7S8, which exhibited magnetic behavior. Vu et al.324 prepared nickel supported CdIn2S4 (Ni-CIS) sponge-like spheres using alcoholysis, followed by a sulfidation process. The CdIn@glycerate solid spheres were prepared on Ni foam and then calcined at 500 °C in air for 3 h. Then the CdIn2O4 was treated under a H2S atmosphere to fabricate sponge-like spheres of CdIn2S4 (Ni-CIS). Yin et al.325 prepared hollow structured Co9S8 and Co3S4 using thermal decomposition of Co2(CO)8 to form CoO nanocrystals, followed by sulfidation of sulfide in an anhydrous o-dichlorobenzene medium. The use of sulfidation of Na2S with Co3O4 and Co(CO3)0.5(OH)x·11H2O has been used, while CoS326 and Co9S8327 were effectively transformed by anion exchange. CoS polyhedral nanocages were also prepared from a mesoporous metal–organic framework (MOF).328 Shen et al.303 reported a facile anion exchange method to fabricate a novel ball-in-ball hollow structured ternary nickel cobalt sulfide (NiCo2S4). The production method involved a facile solvothermal synthesis of metal–glycerate solid spheres, followed by sulfidation with thioacetamide (TAA). The insides of the as-prepared NiCo2S4 hollow spheres were simply modified by varying the reaction temperature during the anion exchange process, as shown in Fig. 20(i). When used as an electrode material for electrochemical studies, the NiCo2S4 ball-in-ball hollow spheres provided excellent performance. Su et al.329 prepared unique yolk–shell CdS microcubes from Cd–Fe Prussian blue equivalents (Cd–Fe–PBA). To examine the growth process and the formation mechanism of the yolk–shell CdS microcubes, a time-dependent sulfidation treatment was carried out at 150 °C. Initially, a sulfidation treatment at 150 °C for 0.5 h revealed a microcube structure with a rough surface. The separated cores and shells of the microcubes were observed at 150 °C for 1.5 h (Fig. 20(ii)), which signified the initial conversion of yolk–shell microcubes. When the sulfidation time was ∼2 h, the core and shell of the microcubes separated completely, and distinct yolk–shell microcubes were attained. As a result, the yolk–shell CdS microcubes exhibited a narrow band gap of ∼2.24 eV with a large surface area of 94.0 m2 g−1. These properties greatly improved the visible light photocatalytic activity. Moreover, a variety of structures such as MS (M = Ni, Cu, Mn) box-in-box hollow structures,330 CoS2 nanobubbles of hollow prisms,331 double shelled ZnCoS,332 NiCo2S4 hollow nanocolloids,333 hollow hybrid of CoS2 with porous carbon,334 and carbon coated hollow CoS2 nanocages335 have been formed. Owing to their highly conductive and porous nature, their energy conversion and storage performance was greatly enhanced.

4.2.12 Microwave irradiation. 
Typically, microwaves generated by magnetrons are electromagnetic waves, and lie in the wavelength region from 1 mm to 1 m, and their frequency range is about 0.3–300 GHz and only a limited frequency of ∼0.9 and 2.45 GHz are acceptable for microwave heating drives.336,337 Heating via microwave radiation leads to the conventional interaction amid microwaves and materials,338,339 hence the electromagnetic energy is transformed to thermal energy. Heat is produced from inside the material, which is in contrast to conventional heating approaches where heat is transported from outside to inside. This internal heating allows a shorter reaction time and saves energy. Hence, irradiation by microwaves is faster and higher efficiency compared to conventional approaches. By using the microwave method, Chen et al.340 prepared metal sulfides of CdS, ZnS, CoS, PbS, CuS, Bi2S3, Sb2S3 and Ag2S, where the metal–thiourea complexes undergo thermal decomposition in ethylene glycol (EG) under microwave irradiation of 800 W for 20 min to produce final metal sulfides. The reactions taking place can be expressed as follows: (30) (31)in which the EG and microwave irradiation played a major role for the preparation of metal sulfides.
Butala et al.341 rapidly prepared FeS2, CoS2, Fe0.5Co0.5S2 and Cu1−xTi2S4 metal sulfides using starting materials of sulfur, titanium, iron, cobalt and copper. The metal to sulfur ratios of the powders ground for each compound was: for CoS2, 1:2.3; FeS2, 1:2.25; Fe0.5Co0.5S2, 1:1:4.6; and CuTi2S4, 1:2:4.25. Initially, FeS2, CoS2, and their solid solutions were heated at 30% power (360 W) for 20 min and slowly cooled to room temperature for a minimum of 2.5 h. The same approach was used to prepare composites. As a result, all the samples exhibited a highly crystalline nature. Recently, the temperature effect on the formation of various NiS2 nanostructures was reported by Pang et al.338 using the raw materials of Ni(NO3)2, sulfourea, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in NaOH solution. After treating the mixture at a temperature of 150 °C for 2, 3 and 4 h under microwave irradiation nanospheres, a mixed structure of cubes with spheres and nanocubes were achieved respectively, as shown in Fig. 21. Later, Krylova et al.342 used a microwave assisted solution–liquid–solid synthesis method to synthesise copper indium sulfide nanowires for efficiently harvesting solar energy using a binuclear single-source precursor (SSP) complex [(PPh3)2Cu][(μ-SPh)2In(SPh)2] (Ph = phenyl), as shown in Fig. 21. In addition, important parameters such as solution temperature, irradiation time, and precursor concentrations were varied systematically. Preliminary experiments suggested that 300 °C was required to thermally decompose the less reactive portion of SSP containing indium. Hollow cobalt sulfide nanoprisms were obtained using precursors of cobalt acetate hydroxide with thioacetamide.343 Compared to the conventional solvothermal synthesis, the microwave synthesis of cobalt sulfide nanoprisms provided materials that exhibited higher hydrogen evolution catalytic activity and better surface area. Jiang et al.344 prepared single-crystalline nanorods of Bi2S3 and Sb2S3 using the ionic liquid of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM][BF4]). As a result, the morphology of the final products was controlled by reaction time. Similarly, nanorods and wires of ZnS and CdS was prepared by a single precursor source of metal ethyl xanthate, where DMF was used as solvent.345 The SnS and SnS2, prepared using tin(IV) chloride and sodium thiosulfate or thiourea for sulfur source were mixed with ethylene glycol.346 For synthesis, the precursors were irradiated with 900 W at 2.45 GHz.

Recently, fullerene-like metal sulfides of MoS2 and WS2 have been prepared using the precursor of polypyrrole nanofibers (PPy NF), sulfur, Mo(CO)6 and W(CO)6.347 The solid mixture was irradiated by 1250 W of microwave (MW) power for 60 s. Importantly, the fast microwave reaction with extreme high temperature (∼1000 °C) led to nanoparticles only a few nanometers in size, as shown in Fig. 21. Similarly, highly efficient and stable MoS2@graphene sheets hybrids were synthesized using MoCl5 dissolved in ethanol, which was added to a GO solution. A stoichiometric amount of sulfur source and thiourea was added to the solution.348 The reduced graphene further assisted the reaction by efficiently absorbing the microwave and transferring the heat to MoS2 crystals. Finally, a highly crystalline MoS2/graphene was attained within 45 seconds, which enhanced the HER activity, as shown in Fig. 21. In addition, hexagonal structured ZnS, CdS and CdS@ZnS were prepared by Raubach et al.349 where the precursors were irradiated at 453 K for 32 min. As a result, the CdS and ZnS interfaces yield an electron charge transfer from the CdS electron-populated clusters to the ZnS hole-populated clusters, which enhanced the photocatalytic performance of the system.
The formation of CdCO3–CdS core–shell nanocubes was proposed by Yang et al.348 Initially, a uniform precursor of CdCO3 nanocubes were attained via precipitation, then a conformal CdS nanocrystal layer was deposited on the CdCO3 core–shell nanocubes via a microwave method and irradiated at 400 W for 15 min. Finally, the CdCO3–CdS core–shell nanocubes were changed to porous CdO–CdS core–shell nanoboxes via a thermal decomposition process.


4.2.13 Electrodeposition. 
Electrodeposition is an alternative and conventional surface modification process to improve the surface features, decorative and highly functional properties of a wide range of materials within a short time period. The basic principle works on Faraday's laws of electrolysis.350–352 Usually, the electrodeposition method includes three electrodes, (i) a working electrode (ii) a reference electrode such as Hg/HgO or Ag/AgCl and (iii) a counter electrode (usually Pt). In this process the working electrode, with a reference electrode, makes a voltage loop to test the potential. A working electrode such as nickel foam, stainless steel or conductive glass is used to make the electrochemical reaction and to load the generated product. Mostly, electrodeposition can be galvanostatic or potentiostatic deposition. All deposition reactions were made when the electrodes were immersed in an electrochemical bath and direct current (DC) is applied. The bath comprises of a chemical salt solution of the metal to be plated. Using this method a variety of nanostructures such as nanosheets, nanowires, tubes and particles of metal sulfides, metal sulfide composites and hybrids have been prepared.353–356 In order to electrodeposit metal sulfides throughout the channels of the template, a porous material of nickel foam was mounted on a bath; as shown in Fig. 22. Initially the pre-cleaned nickel foam was used as a working electrode and the auxiliary electrode (counter electrode) was a platinum wire and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode. The analyte solution consisted of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and thiourea.357 Chronoamperometry was then carried out at −1.0 V at 10 °C. Finally the deposition time was varied from 2.5 to 5 min and well-ordered Ni2FeS4 was obtained by the following reactions, Ni2+ + 2Thiourea → Ni(Thiourea)22+(32) Ni(Thiourea)22+ + NiFe → Ni2FeS4(33)

In addition, electrodeposition was used for the formation of ternary CdxZn1−xS on Ag(1 1 1) by Loglio et al.358 Similarly, Lai et al.359 reported the template-assisted electrochemical synthesis of Cu2S nanotrees. Initially, Cu nanowires were electrodeposited on an aluminum template. For instance, CuSO4·5H2O was used as a Cu source and the electrolyte contained H3BO3 and 20 vol% methanol. Afterward, the template was removed using 1 M NaOH aqueous solution, and Cu2S nanotrees were produced by H2S sulfidation of metallic copper nanowires. The CuS nanorods were prepared by depositing in the template pores at a constant potential. Na2S2O3 and CuSO4 in H2O were used as precursors and the electrolyte was tartaric acid with a pH below 2.5.360
Recently, template-free electrodeposition of CuS and Cu2−xS nanowires was reported using CuSO4·5H2O and thiourea as the sources of copper (Cu2+) and sulfur, respectively; and hydrochloric acid (HCl) was used as electrolyte.361 The growth mechanism of nanowires was credited to the low concentration of Cu2+ and thiourea species, with an applied potential of −0.85 V vs. Ag/AgCl and deposition time between 30 min and 3 h. In addition, galvanostatically electrodeposited Ni3S2/Ni nanocomposites on Cu foils (4 × 5 cm2) were prepared at room temperature using a two-electrode configuration, where NiSO4·6H2O, thiourea, and citric acid were the sources of nickel and sulfur and pH buffer reagent.362 A number of researchers pointed out that the thiourea concentration was a key parameter influencing sulfur content in the metal–S deposit. Lin et al.363 undertook cathodic deposition of a porous CoS on FTO glass substrates in a near-neutral deposition bath (NH4OH with pH ∼ 6) at room temperature where the Co and S sources were CoCl2·6H2O and thiourea, CH4N2S (ARCOS, 99%) in a three-electrode setup. The deposition by potentiodynamic was set between −1.2 V and 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 for fixed cycles. As a result, highly porous flakes of CoS were acquired. Later, Li et al.364 electrodeposited 3D macroporous nickel sulfide on graphene-covered make-up cotton as a flexible electrode through “dip and dry” and electrodeposition methods. The electrodeposition solution was composed of nickel chloride hexahydrate (0.1 M) and thiourea (1 M). The deposition voltage was ∼0.9 V and continued for several minutes at room temperature. In a similar approach, different morphologies of nickel cobalt sulfides were attained by controlled composition onto the flexible carbon cloth.356 The electrodeposition solution contained CoCl2·6H2O with different concentrations of NiCl2·6H2O and thiourea, whereas the solution pH ∼ 6 was adjusted using diluted NH3·H2O. Similarly, SnS was electrodeposited onto single-crystal Au(100) using a solution of SnCl2, thiosulfate, and L-tartaric acid at pH 2.5.365 During deposition, the potential widow for common aqueous or organic media was low.366 Moreover, ionic liquids display significant advantages that enable them to overcome the limits imposed by common aqueous media, such as long electrochemical window of ∼6 V and exceptionally low vapor pressures, which enable electrodeposition above 100 °C.367 Such attractive characteristics are beneficial to manufacture metal sulfide compounds in an effective manner. Recently, it was demonstrated that ionic liquids can solubilize molecular sulfur at the melting point of ∼115 °C.368 Such a discovery is a motivation to discover the growth of new metal sulfides by this route. Chen et al.369 deposited CuS thin films using an electrolytic bath that consisted of different molar ratios of Cu(TFSI)2 and sulfur powder in the ionic liquid [EMIm]TFSI. Finally, single-crystallite of covellite CuS thin films with a flake-like nanostructure was obtained. By using the room temperature ionic liquid of PP13-TFSI (RTIL), MoS2 nano-particles and flakes were synthesized by Murugesan et al.370 whereas, molybdenum glycolate and 1,4-butanedithiol was used as the source materials.

4.3 Other miscellaneous routes
A variety of other techniques also have been used by other research groups and are discussed below.

4.3.1 Ion exchange method. 
The ion exchange method is a self-template technique371 and it is a cost-effective method since it facilitates nanostructure control via a top-down route, leading to multi-faceted hierarchical structures.47,303 Specifically, anion-exchange leads to hollowing or tunneling of solid precursor wires, rods, and spheres without destroying the morphologies and structures. For example, the microstructure and composition of the Ag2S/Ag3PO4 nanocomposites were varied by an anion exchange method.372 During synthesis, the S2− ions (from Na2S) substitute for the [PO4]3− units on the surface of Ag3PO4 dodecahedrons to form Ag2S nanoparticles, due to the much smaller solubility constant (Ksp) value ∼6.6 × 10−50 of Ag2S compared to Ag3PO4 ∼1.4 × 10−16. The condition of nucleation and growth of Ag2S nanoparticles is highly dependent on the concentration of S2− during this ion-exchange process.
Metal sulfide materials have different solubility constants (Ksp) in water. According to their different solubility, metal sulfides could transform via ion exchange. Nanosheets and hollow nanorods of CdS were synthesized using CdCl2·2.5H2O and Na2S·9H2O.373 Initially, the precipitation of nanoporous Cd(OH)2 nanosheets and nanorods were obtained and then CdS nanosheets and hollow nanorods were fabricated followed by S2−/OH− ion-exchange conversion of Cd(OH)2 to CdS. Similarly Wu et al.374 reported a two step ion exchange method to prepare a nanotube network of MCo2S4 (M = Ni, Fe, Zn). A precursor of Na2S was used as a sulfur source. During synthesis, the cations of Co2+, Ni2+, and NH4+ react with the anions of CO32− and OH− is released from the urea hydrolysis, leading to the formation of hexagonal solid thin microsheets of NiCo(OH)x(CO3)y(HCO3)z with smooth surfaces, as shown in Fig. 23. After a 2 h reaction, several small needles on the edges and corners of each hexagon were observed. After 8 h, these microsheets are converted to a 3D porous architecture of NiCo2(OH)3(CO3)1.5 hexagons with a NW-interwoven and a round central hole over an anion replacement of HCO3− by CO32− and OH− ions was observed. Zhuo et al.375 prepared hierarchical nanosheet based 2H-MoS2 (i.e. semiconducting 2H phased MoS2) nanotubes by an anion exchange reaction of the inorganic–organic hybrid nanowires of Mo3O10(C2H10N2) (ethylenediamine trimolybdate, denoted as MoO3–EDA) with a sulfur source of L-cysteine at elevated temperature. The ethylenediamine (EDA) dissolution in the aqueous solution solvent and the concentration gradient with driven outward diffusion of MoO3–EDA during the anion exchange reaction were found to play a major role in the creation of the nanotubes of the hierarchical nanosheet. Moreover, the prepared hierarchical nanosheet based MoS2 nanotubes were found to be highly active for electrochemical and visible light photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions. Remarkably, a sequential ion-change strategy has been developed by Lou et al. to fabricate onion-like NiCo2S4 metal sulfide particles.69 Due to the complex onion-like morphology of the NiCo2S4 particles, it exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance with long term durability. From this study, it is clear that an onion-like morphology of NiCo2S4 has a significant role in the performance of an electrode, which provides a large active surface area and relatively short diffusion pathway for ions, leading to high utilization of the active materials.
 Fig. 23  Schematic of the construction of NiCo2S4 HPHTMSs by well-interwoven NTs. In the presence of NH4F, a slow anisotropic growth leads to compound I of NiCo2(OH)x(CO3)y(HCO3)z, while the product is already compound II of NiCo2(OH)3(CO3)1.5 after only 0.5 h and its morphology is spherical with a rough NW-covering without NH4F. The nanostructure and composition change with time during the first ion-exchange process from compound I to compound II is presented in detail. The second anion-exchange results in the formation of compound III of NiCo2S4 HPHTMSs. The insets illustrate local magnifications of several interwoven NWs and sulfides NTs. A wire-interwoven network structure in a steel mesh with strong mechanical stability is also presented. Reproduced from ref. 374 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2018. 


4.3.2 Template engaged technique. 
The template synthesis technique of micro- and nano-materials has been a cutting-edge technology advanced since the 1990s. This method is not sensitive to synthesis conditions, is easy to control and implement, and can control the morphology, structure, and size of nanomaterials through the template material.47,376,377 Moreover, the template approach has resulted in improved dispersed products with large specific surface areas with desired structures. Notwithstanding the above stated developments, in most cases, the resultant hollow structures are spherical or square in shape. Recently, hollow Co3S4 was fabricated by Liang et al.378 using a ZIF-67 as the template and thioacetamide as the sulfide source. A hierarchical NiS box-in-box hollow nanostructure was formed using the initial templates of uniform silica nanoboxes which was first prepared using Fe2O3 nanocubes as the template.330 Subsequently, template nickel silicate box-in-box hollow nanostructures were synthesized using nickel acetate, ammonia, and ammonium chloride. Upon completion of the reaction, the as-prepared box-in-box nickel silicate structure was transformed into nickel sulfide box-in-box hollow nanostructures over a solution-based sulfidation method in the existence of Na2S. A similar approach was adopted to make CuS and MnS box-in-box hollow structures.
Among the existing synthetic procedures, hard template methods have been established as a versatile approach to make well-defined hollow structures with a controlled shell number and high uniformity. Typically, the synthesis of metal sulfides in nanostructured form or as a composite can successfully overcome this pulverization, specifically by using porous carbon as the host structure for the metal sulfides, since the carbon can adsorb and capture the intermediates of polysulfide responsible for the shuttle effect, subsequently leading to longer cycle life of the final materials.379,380 A 3D CoS2/carbon composite was prepared by Zhang et al.381 The formation of this 3D porous structure was created by self-stacking NaCl crystals, which acted as a template and L-cysteine was selected as a sulfur source. Similarly, molecular templates were used to synthesize CuS nanorods.382 Using the EDA solvent template, shape and phase controlled ZnS nanocrystals and ZnO flake-like dendrites were prepared from a lamellar molecular precursor ZnS·(NH2CH2CH2NH2)0.5 by Yu et al.383 In addition, mesostructured metal germanium sulfide materials were prepared using the precursor of non-aqueous surfactant-templated assembly of adamantanoid [Ge4S10]4− cluster.384 In the presence of quaternary alkylammonium surfactants, the [Ge4S10]4− anions in formamide solution self-organize with metal cations such as Co2+, Ni2+, Cu+ and Zn2+ created regular metal germanium sulfide mesostructures with a hexagonal structure, and some fiber-like morphologies were also observed.
1D nanotubular structures hold potential for use in numerous fields such as composite materials, catalysis, batteries and photocatalysis. In this aspect, layer-rolled NiS rolls with a diameter of 0.5 ± 1.0 μm and about 5.0 μm in length was prepared by Jiang et al.385 During fabrication, it was observed that the ammonia molecules play multiple roles in the formation of layer-rolled NiS structures, serving as the architecture template, coordinating agent of Ni(NH3)62+, the attacking agent of CS2, and the source of hydrogen bonds. In addition, ammonia served as the reaction template. Hydrogen-bond interactions (NH-OH2) also played an important role in the growth of 2D layered NiS materials. Wire-like CdS nanoparticles with diameters of 4–5 nm and length of ∼170 nm were prepared by Zhang et al.386 using single molecule templates of well-ordered amphiphilic core–shell cylindrical polymer brushes ([AA25-nBA61]1500 contained 0.077 mmol of acrylic acid). The coordination of cadmium ions with carboxylate groups in the core of the brush favored growth, in which the creation of CdS nanoparticles inside the polymer brush was through the reaction of the coordinated Cd2+ ions with H2S. If the formation of CdS nanoparticles was completed, then the polymer brush starts again with its original morphology and chemical structure and can therefore continue to be used as template. Similarly, a NiS@C hybrid material was produced by a controllable template approach.387 As shown in Fig. 24(i), uniform diameter ∼450 nm SiO2 nanospheres were used as a hard template during synthesis. After reacting with a precursor of nickel nitrate aqueous solution and coated by a resin, SiO2@Ni-silicate@RF spheres were fabricated, followed by carbonization. Subsequently, NiS@C with a well-maintained spherical morphology was fabricated by a sulfidation process using Na2S. Likewise, acid-functionalized MWCNTs were used as both ligands and templates to prepare the Cu2S–MWCNT hybrid nanostructures.388

4.3.3 Self-assembly method. 
Conventional template methods for the preparation of hollow spheres usually require a removable or sacrificial template such as carbon, silica spheres, reducing metal nanoparticles and monodisperse polymer latex, to direct the growth of inorganic nanoparticles on their surfaces by adsorption or chemical reactions. However, the use of such templates suffers from disadvantages of high cost and tedious synthetic approaches, which can prevent them from being used in large-scale applications. In contrast, a one-pot template-free method for controlled preparation has been developed to design hollow nanostructures with rationally considered parameters.389,390 Recently, a number of one-pot template-free methods for generating various inorganic micro- and nano-structures have been established using physical phenomena such as Ostwald ripening391,392 and Kirkendall type diffusion.388,393 In this aspect, Yu et al.394 prepared monodisperse ZnS hollow spheres using a one-pot template-free method. A defect rich WS2 was synthesized via a self-template method,395 in which tungsten oxide was partially sulfurized to form nanosheets of WS2/WO3 at 450–750 °C. Furthermore, a porous structure of WS2 was designed after the removal of the WO3 template by alkaline solution and additional edge defects were acquired.
Hollow nanostructures are of interest for a range of applications. Yu et al.396 prepared an initial sacrificial template of tetragonal nanoprisms of nickel–cobalt acetate hydroxide precursors with controllable Ni/Co molar ratio to fabricate NixCo3−xS4 hollow nanoprisms. In addition to chemical composition design, the rational structural design of electrode materials is important for the performance of electrochemical reactions. Recently, a template free method was used to form CuCo2O4 hollow spheres with thiourea, and to fabricate hollow spheres of CuCo2S4 without destroying the hollow structure;397 N/S doped graphene was then coated simultaneously through an electrostatic self-assembly method, as shown in Fig. 24(ii). In addition, C@Bi2S3 core–shell heterostructures were synthesized via a sacrificial template-free method by Vattikuti et al.398 This C@Bi2S3 core–shell feature offered an efficient charge separation and transfer due to the heterojunction. Wang et al.399 prepared Cu2−xS@C, Cu2−xS@TiO2 and Cu2−xS@MoS2 hollow spheres via a self-templating thermolysis strategy using CuS. All the prepared composite materials were tested for electrochemical properties; and all materials showed excellent stability. This was attributed to the coverage of carbon on Cu2−xS that prevents the decomposition of Cu2−xS. Moreover, other metal sulfides and/or their composites/heterostructures were also prepared using some synthesis techniques such as chemical bath deposition and similar techniques.

4.4 Perspectives on fabrication methods
A number of effective fabrication methods have been established to prepare high yield, large scale and low-cost production of 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D metal sulfide nanostructures. The outstanding performance of these prepared nanostructures for specific needs, especially in electrocatalysis (for instance, catalytic HER reactions), have been revealed. From the view point of the controlled synthesis process, the 2D (especially MoS2, WS2 and their heterostructures) and 3D (for example hollow spheres, boxes, cubes, ball-in ball-structures) templated synthesis method has proven to be a promising strategy. In addition, surface morphologies from the bulk to diverse nano- and micro-structures have been generated via simple strategies; for example hydrothermal, solvothermal, and sulfidation. The achieved nanocrystals have varied from the highly crystalline to the formation of defect-enhanced structures. The nanocrystalline nature of the materials formed have been controlled via experimental parameters, such as the precursor concentration, sulfur source, solvent type, pH of reaction medium, reaction temperature and surfactants. Increasing number of approaches is being examined, and new types of metal sulfides have been manufactured and proposed. With the rational strategy of composition, structure, morphology, defect, loading substrate, temperature and porosity, metal sulfides can be applied in a variety of energy fields. However, many of the mechanisms underlying the growth of 1D metal sulfide nanostructures, ultrathin 2D nanosheets and 3D (for example, hollow boxes, ball in ball shape, hierarchical etc.,) nanomaterials remain unclear. Thus, the investigation of the mechanisms behind these nanocrystal growth routes and understanding of their final properties is of interest in future research efforts.
5. Fundamentals of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and photoelectrochemical water splitting
5.1 Basics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
The fundamental and practical aspect of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of interest to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. As with other electrochemical reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the HER requires an overpotential, and hence, it is vital to develop suitable electrocatalysts to exploit the reaction efficiency.400–403 Noble metals such as platinum are ideal electrocatalyst for HER reactions in terms of low overpotential and efficiency. However, their high cost, lack of stability and CO poisoning effects has led to a continued quest for developing low-cost, durable and naturally abundant electrocatalysts.404–406
A range of electrocatalysts have been examined for use in HER in both acidic407–409 and alkaline environments.410,411 The HER begins by the adsorption of hydrogen (Hads) on the electrocatalyst surface,412 which is represented as the Volmer reaction (eqn (34) and (35)). Subsequently, depending on the nature of electrocatalysis, this can progress with the reaction of two adsorbed hydrogen (i.e., the Tafel reaction) or an adsorbed H with H+ reaction from the electrolyte (i.e., the Heyrovsky reaction) to generate a H2 molecule. Regardless of the catalytic reaction pathway, H adsorption is an important step, and thus, it is an energetic task of the highly active electrocatalyst to facilitate the adsorption reactions. Remarkably, the adsorption free energy of hydrogen (H) on platinum is close to the thermoneutral state (ΔGH* ≈ 0; Gibbs free energy). This is the main reason that platinum is considered as an efficient HER electrocatalyst. The mechanism of the electrocatalytic HER reactions via Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanisms (eqn (34)–(37)) or the Volmer–Tafel mechanism (eqn (38)–(40)) are given below:412,413 H3O+(aq) + e− + * ⇌ Hads + H2O(l), Volmer reaction (acidic)(34) H2O(l) + e− + * ⇌ Hads + OH−(aq), Volmer reaction (alkaline)(35) Hads + H3O+(aq) + e− ⇌ H2(g) + H2O(l) + *, Heyrovsky reaction (acidic)(36) Hads + H2O(l) + e− ⇌ H2(g) + OH−(aq) + *, Heyrovsky reaction (alkaline)(37) H3O+(aq) + e− + * ⇌ Hads + H2O(l), Volmer reaction (acidic)(38) H2O(l) + e− + * ⇌ Hads + OH−(aq), Volmer reaction (alkaline)(39) Hads + Hads ⇌ H2(g) + 2*, Tafel reaction (acidic and alkaline)(40)where * designates an empty active site. The basic factors in both reactions are the binding of the intermediate hydrogen to the surface of the catalyst.414,415 This leads to plotting the catalyst activity against the hydrogen binding free energy via volcano plots. Since the Hads is involved in the complete processes, hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH) is commonly considered as an important factor to lead the progress and optimize the non-noble metal catalysts for HER.

5.1.1 Assessment of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). 
As shown in Fig. 25(a), a conventional HER experimental setup consists of a reference electrode (usually Ag/AgCl or RHE), counter electrode (platinum wire or mesh) and a working electrode. Typically, for the working electrode, the catalysts are often coated on a nickel foam, titanium mesh, carbon cloth, carbon fiber cloth or glassy carbon electrode. Similarly, Fig. 25 shows the linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) which offer specific visual evidence to evaluate the HER. The onset potential (Eonset), directs the HER to start in the system. In addition, ηj is the overpotential under a specific cathodic current density of ∼10 mA cm−2 and jd is the diffusion-limiting current density. The Eonset, and ηj can be used to estimate the effort of the HER reaction. In general, a lower onset potential, lower overpotential with more negative current designates a more rapid HER reaction. The HER mechanism is reflected by the Tafel slope;148,416 where the current (I) vs. potential (V) has an exponential manner, which may be written as eqn (41) as the supposed Tafel equation (below shown for cathodic currents) j = j0e−(η/b)(41)
 Fig. 25  Schematic of experimental setups and corresponding results of (a) electrocatalytic hydrogen generation (b) photocatalytic powder solution based hydrogen generation and (c) photoelectrochemical water splitting. 
In the above equation, the current density is represented as j, exchange current density is j0, Tafel slope is b, and η is the overpotential. Notably, an ideal catalyst gives the highest currents at the smallest overpotential; it can be perceived from the Tafel calculation if an electrocatalyst has a low Tafel slope (b) and a large exchange current density j0. The significance of the Tafel slope can be predicted when one recalls the different orders of magnitude of the HER currents that both the electrocatalytic and PEC hydrogen evolution involve.417 If the Tafel slope is too high, the catalyst needs substantial overpotentials to generate the required currents. Importantly, the Tafel slope depends on several factors, including the reaction pathway and the active sites adsorption conditions as well as the material synthetic methods of the materials. In order to enhance the hydrogen generation production rate, sacrificial agents are often used.418–420

5.2 HER in powder-based solution photocatalysts
Recently, photocatalytic H2 generation reactions at a semiconductor powder photocatalysts dispersed in aqueous solution have gained interest, since it is a promising technology that could offer a simple, low-cost and safe procedure. The photocatalytic water splitting mechanism is an uphill reaction, and the Gibbs free energy upturns by 237 kJ mol−1.95,421,422 The energy required to drive photocatalytic water splitting is conveyed by external light, preferably sunlight, as shown in Fig. 25(b). When an optimum amount of photocatalysts with a precise set of properties is dispersed in an aqueous electrolyte and exposed with external light, photon (light) energy is converted into electrochemical energy423 that can split water into usable hydrogen and oxygen. Accordingly, intermittent solar energy is then converted into an inherently more storable form of energy within chemical bonds. Upon the irradiation of light, the powder photocatalysts absorbs light photons with energies higher than its band gap energy, and electrons and holes are produced in the semiconducting photocatalyst particles through band-gap excitation. Subsequently, the photoexcited charge carriers are transported to surface active sites and are then consumed by surface redox reactions in the liquid (electrolyte) solution, where they engage in oxidation and reduction reactions. Moreover, mass diffusion of reactants and products must also continue. In addition, photoexcited carrier recombination also occurs along with these reactions. Hence, for efficient hydrogen evolution via water splitting, the separation of charge in photocatalyst particles and the redox reactions on their surface must progress within the lifetimes of the photoexcited carriers. To complete photocatalytic water splitting using a photocatalyst, the band gap of the material must straddle the reduction and oxidation potentials of water. Finally, the amounts of evolved gases (O2 and H2) were measured through gas chromatography with respect to reaction time, as shown in Fig. 25(b).
5.3 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting

Fig. 25(c) illustrates the basic experimental setup in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) device. A three-electrode system comprises of a single absorber photoelectrode, whereas, if the photoelectrode was a photocathode (p-type materials) it favors the HER reaction and if the photoanode (n-type materials) is involved it favors the OER reaction.1,424,425 PEC water splitting is relatively complex and it is the combination of above said two systems; see Sections 5.1 and 5.2. When a photoelectrode is immersed in an electrolyte solution and irradiated with light, electrons in the valence band jump into the conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band, whereas electron and holes transfer takes place among the semiconductor photocatalysts and the electrolyte solution. As a result, the excited electrons can drive the H+ reduction reaction to generate H2, where the holes can drive H2O oxidation reaction to produce oxygen (O2). In photoanodes, upon light irradiation, photoexcited holes accumulate on the surface of the semiconductor and favor the OER reactions, see Fig. 25(c), whereas, the electrons are transported to a counter electrode and further used in reduction reactions. For efficient production of oxygen, the valence band of the photoanodes photocatalyst need to be more positive than the OER potential.426 As shown in Fig. 25, a p-type photocatalyst works as a photocathode for efficient hydrogen evolution when the conduction band edge needs to be more negative than the H2 evolution potential. Therefore, PEC reactions on photoelectrodes are determined by photoexcited minority carriers in both cases. Additionally, an external voltage can be applied between a counter electrode and photoelectrode to alter the potential to drive redox reactions on a counter electrode even if the photoelectrode's Fermi level is located at an undesirable potential.
5.4 Description of efficiencies

5.4.1 Solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency. 
The efficiency of energy conversion is an essential factor for any water splitting system, either for a photocatalytic or PEC water splitting cell. The usual solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency (ηSTH) can be stated as the ratio between the total energy produced and the input energy from standard sunlight irradiation (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and they are as follows,427,428 (42)where ΔG is the Gibbs free energy (∼237 kJ mol−1), rH is the rate of hydrogen evolution in moles per second; Isun is the intensity of incident light (1 sun power ∼100 mW cm−2) and A is the illuminated photoelectrode area (cm2).


5.4.2 Faradaic efficiency. 
As estimation of faradaic efficiency is the most valuable way to validate that the generated photocurrent is in fact due to water splitting and not photocorrosion of the electrodes or other side reactions. This is defined as the proportion of the actual evolved gas divided by the theoretically evolved gas made on the measured photocurrent. (43) (44) (45)The unit of gas evolution/produced is moles; Jphoto is the photocurrent density (A cm−2) produced during the measurement time T (s); A is the light exposed photoelectrode area (cm2); e is the electron charge (1.602 × 10−19 C) and NA is the Avogadro constant (6.02 × 1023 mol−1). The amounts of evolved gases can be measured using gas chromatography (GC) or, in the case of oxygen, by using an appropriate oxygen electrode or fluorescence detector.


5.4.3 Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE). 
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) can be measured at fixed incident wavelengths. The IPCE may define as the number of photogenerated charge carriers involved in the photocurrent per incident photon, which can be denoted by the following equation: (46) (47)where Jphoto is the photocurrent density at that specific wavelength of incident light (mA cm−2); e is the electron charge (1.602 × 10−19 C); h is the Planck's constant (6.626 × 10−34 J s); c is the speed of light (3.0 × 108 × 109 nm s−1); λ is incident light wavelength (nm); I(λ) is the incident light intensity at that particular wavelength (mW cm−2).
In the IPCE calculation, optical losses such as transmission and reflection are ignored. In order to rectify these optical losses, the absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency (APCE) can be used to define the quantum efficiency. The APCE is defined as the number of photogenerated charge carriers involving in the photocurrent per absorbed photon, which is called the internal quantum efficiency, and can be stated by the following equation:429,430 (48)where A, R, T are the optical absorption, reflection, and transmission, respectively.


5.4.4 Apparent quantum yield (AQY or QE). 
The quantity of evolved hydrogen and oxygen can be measured using a gas chromatograph. The fuel gas evolution rate is classically assessed by the amount of fuel per unit time. The apparent quantum yield (QE) is normally used to estimate the performance of photocatalysts as follows:429 (49) (50)


5.4.5 Solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency. 
In a PEC system, the photoelectrode is made of a semiconducting photocatalysts, which is sustained on a conductive substrate as the working electrode (p-type photocatalyst as the cathode and an n-type photocatalyst as the anode). In contrast to the particulate method, the photocatalytic reduction and oxidization reactions occur on different electrodes. For instance, if we use an n-type semiconductor photoanode for overall water splitting in a PEC system, in which hydrogen is produced at the cathode while oxygen is generated at the photoanode surface. Therefore, the reaction products could be collected in separate chambers. Furthermore, a PEC is a good tool for investigating the photoinduced charge separation and charge transfer processes in semiconducting materials, the reaction kinetics and the mechanism at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. Hence, the efficiency of separate photoelectrode can be calculated as:425 (51)where J is the measured photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Vredox and Vapp are the redox potential of a reaction, (Vredox = 1.23 V) and the applied external bias (Vapp) respectively, Ilight is the measured intensity solar radiation (mW cm−2). This efficiency is also called as applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE).
In addition, the photocurrent is a function of the incident wavelength, and thus the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) is a more appropriate factor to describe the photoconversion efficiency, which can be written as;36 (52)where λ is the incident light wavelength (nm), J is the photocurrent density and Iλ is the irradiated light power at specific wavelength (mW cm−2).

6. Electrochemical hydrogen generation using metal sulfides
6.1 Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) enabled by mono-metal sulfides
Typically, hydrogen generation through the electrochemical method depends on the use of platinum metal as a well-known HER catalyst. Alternative materials are sought to advance cost- effective, abundant and highly effective HER catalysts.431 Recent advances in material research have identified that metal sulfides, particularly MoS2,414,432–434 WS2,435,436 CoS,437,438 FeS,438 and NiS439 are potentially low-cost alternatives to Pt for the generation of H2 from water by electrochemical reactions.

6.1.1 MoS2 and WS2. 
Hinnemann et al.440 recognized the potential of using the edge sites of MoS2 as a hydrogen evolution catalyst. In principle, when the free energy of adsorbed atomic hydrogen is near to the reactant or product i.e., , a material is potentially a good catalyst for HER reactions.145,441 Similarly, Jaramillo et al.414 reported that the HER activity of MoS2 nanocrystals is proportional to the edge length of the crystals, but not the surface area. This was verified by both experimental and theoretical calculations, as the preferential exposure of edge sites resulted in more active MoS2 electrocatalysts.432,442 In addition, amorphous MoS2 is a highly active and versatile catalysts for HER in acidic solutions. The enhanced HER activity of amorphous MoS2 was thought to be mainly due to the short-range atomic arrangements.443,444 Merki et al.445 reported that the amorphous MoS2 film can function in water and is well-suited for a wide pH range from 0–13. Significantly, the amorphous catalyst can achieve a geometric current density of 15 mA cm−2 at a small overpotential of ∼200 mV. It also exhibited a low Tafel slope of ∼40 mV dec−1, which is lower than that of MoS2 nanoparticles, and is among the most active low-cost HER catalyst they prepared. Due to the amorphous nature, MoS2 films could retain more unsaturated active sites on the edges than single crystalline and nanoparticles of MoS2.
Liang et al.446 prepared ultrathin nanoflakes of WS2 by a high temperature solution method, which possessed a monolayer thickness and abundant edges. The enhanced HER activity of this catalyst under an acid medium was due to structural features that provided a low overpotential of 100 mV and a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec−1. Through appropriate compositional and structural engineering, this WS2 catalyst was able to catalyze hydrogen generation at low overpotential of ∼100 mV with outstanding durability in acidic environment. By exfoliation, WS2 nanodots were prepared by Zhao et al.447 where a high concentration of octahedral phase (1T) of WS2 nanodots was responsible for the enhanced catalytic HER activities with a low onset potential ∼90 mV and small Tafel slope of ∼51 mV dec−1. This performance is superior to the hexagonal (2H) WS2 nanodots.


6.1.2 CoxSy, FexSy, and NixSy. 
Interestingly, within the group of transition metal sulfides, iron disulfide (FeS2), cobalt disulfide (CoS2), and nickel disulfide (NiS2) are extensively investigated. Recently, Faber et al.438 provided a comparative HER analysis on FeS2, CoS2, NiS2, and their alloys, they are shown in Fig. 26(i). Their performance, as distinguished by their ability to enable high catalytic current densities at small overpotentials tends to increase with increasing cobalt content, with CoS2 being superior, suggesting an important role of cobalt in facilitating the HER. In addition, they compared the polysulfide reduction mechanism of FeS2, NiS2, and their alloys to that of CoS2 and identified that NiS2 possessed a particularly high activity. Later, the same research group353 reported a high HER performance of nanowires of CoS2, where they exhibited current densities of 10 mA cm−2 at low overpotentials of −145 mV vs. RHE, while microwire CoS2 had an overpotential of −158 mV vs. RHE, respectively as shown in Fig. 26(ii). An increased operational stability and cycling durability of the CoS2 was credited to its micro- and nano-structural effects. Similarly, CoS films showed high current densities at a low potential with near 100% faradaic efficiency in a neutral pH and also revealed an excellent HER activity in 1.0 M KOH solution.448 However, it was observed that, under strong acid solution of 0.5 M H2SO4, the CoS film rapidly dissolved with a decreased HER performance. In addition, uniform needle arrays of CoS2 were grown on a titanium mesh to investigate the urea assisted electrolytic H2 production.449 The nano arrays grown on a titanium mesh afforded more exposed catalytic active sites, thus an excellent HER activity at a voltage of ∼1.59 V for 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH with 0.3 M urea solution was observed. Furthermore, an electrodeposited cobalt sulfide film450 performed as a robust HER catalyst in neutral pH water, as well as other aqueous media, achieving a low overpotential of 43 mV, 100% faradaic efficiency, Tafel slope of 93 mV dec−1 and high current densities of 50 mA cm−2 that could operate for at least 40 h. In addition, the amorphous CoSx catalyst451 required only ∼83 mV overpotential for an operational current of ∼2 mA cm−2. It was believed that disulfide anions S22− on CoS2 surfaces play an important role for the HER reaction, as in MoS2. However, after electrolysis for 3 h, the Co:S ratio was analyzed by EDS and decreased ratio from 1.4:1 to 0.98:1, indicating that a fraction of the cobalt had dissolved into the electrolyte.

Using a 2D Ni(OH)2 template, NiS2 nanosheets on a nickel foam were prepared by Ma et al.,452 as shown in Fig. 27(i). The NiS2 nanosheets exhibited an activation period during HER with a prominent structural and compositional change in an alkaline environment. Surprisingly, the NiS2 nanosheets were converted into ultrathin metallic nickel nanosheets under an alkaline environment, which was confirmed by XPS spectra. Moreover, during HER, the nickel acted as a catalytic active species with low overpotential of 67 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2, see Fig. 28(i). Likewise, flakes of Ni3S2/NF were prepared by a hydrothermal method.453 The Ni3S2/NF provided a current density of ∼10 mA cm−2 at a lower overpotential of −223 mV for HER in a basic solution. The result showed that Ni3S2/NF retains its catalytic activity for at least 200 h. Based on the moles of Ni in Ni3S2 after 200 h, a total turnover number of 1.87 × 103 was found. The Ni3S2/NF showed an excellent stability after ∼10000 cycles. Finally, after several recycling tests, the final morphology and microstructure of the Ni3S2/NF were also intact, as shown in Fig. 27(ii). Ho et al.454 indicated that ALD deposited Ni3S2 thin films on Au and SiO2 can act as an excellent cathode and anode in an alkaline environment. Without thermal annealing, the crystalline Ni3S2 layers exhibited highly efficient and stable performance for the HER with a low overpotential of ∼300 mV and a high turnover frequency with a stable operation for 100 h at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The fabrication of an amorphous interface in an interwoven NiS/NiS2 structure was reported by Li et al.455 Such an amorphous interface consisted of an intermediate state species in the conversion of NiS2 to NiS, and reduced the interfacial energy for rapid ion transport, which resulted in a geometrical current density of 100 mA cm−2 at a small overpotential of 248 mV. It was observed that the amorphous interface in NiS/NiS2 was expected to separate the H* and H− intermediates onto dissimilar interface sites, and reduce the interfacial energy and charge-transfer resistance.

The structure dependent active sites by both experimental and theoretical results affirmed that, owing to the strong affinity of hydrogen, NiS has a higher activity than Ni3S.456 For Ni3S2 nanoparticles, the rate determining step is the Volmer step whereas for NiS it is the mixed Volmer and Heyrovsky reaction, as proven by Tafel analysis. It was estimated that regulating the facet or nanoparticle of the nickel sulfide can provide potential candidates for HER electrocatalysts. Recently, Yu et al.377 reported NiS frame-like nanostructures for electrochemical reactions in alkaline electrolyte. The HER activity of NiS nanoframes was significantly higher than bare nickel foam. NiS nanoframes with a size of 100 nm had overpotential of ∼94 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2, whereas 300 and 600 nm nanoframes required a higher overpotential of 115 mV and 148 mV, respectively to reach 10 mA cm−2. Moreover, the Tafel slope of the 100 nm NiS nanoframes was ∼131 mV dec−1 and this was smaller than bare nickel foam ∼146 mV dec−1, indicating facile electrochemical reaction kinetics by smaller sized NiS nanoframes with higher specific surface area.


6.1.3 Other mono-metal sulfides. 
The optimization of active electronic sites is important for developing highly active catalysts, since thermodynamics itself may not form an optimal electronic state. Through intrinsic charge engineering, auto-optimization of HER activity of ReS2 were investigated by Zhou et al.457 Their experimental and theoretical results exposed that intrinsic charge compensation from S to Re–Re bonds could influence the active electronic states, allowing hydrogen to absorb on the active sites weakly nor strongly. In addition, in ReS2, the two S sites exhibited optimal H2 adsorption free energies ΔGH* of 0.016 and 0.061 eV, which are nearby to zero equivalent to the maximum HER activity. This auto-optimization by charge engineering was further verified by a higher turnover frequency per sulfur atom of 1–10 s−1 and smaller overpotential of −147 mV at 10 mA cm−2.
Monolayer VS2 has the potential to exhibit a higher HER activity than other metal sulfides.458,459 Additionally, it has been shown that the catalytic activity of VS2 nanostructures depends on edge structure and configuration.460 To examine this, hexagon and nearly half hexagon structured single crystalline VS2 nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 28, were prepared via CVD on a SiO2/Si substrate for HER.461 During HER testing, VS2 showed an extremely low overpotential of −68 mV (at 10 mA cm−2), approaching that of −43 mV for platinum and also small Tafel slopes of ∼34 mV dec−1, along with good stability, signifying its potential as a candidate for non-noble metal catalyst for the HER, particularly since the overpotential was lower than for other 2D structures such as 2H-, 1T-MoS2158,414 and 2H-, 1T-WS2.145 In addition, the 1T-VS2 catalyst only required a small overpotential of −0.34 V to achieve 100 mA cm−2. The high activity of VS2 possibly originated from the robust activity of both basal plane and edge sites.
Low dimensional nanostructures are of great interest for HER owing to their large surface area and rich edge sites. A facile hydrothermal method was employed to grow vertical VS2 nanoplates with high density on carbon paper.462 The nanoplate arrays of VS2 showed a high HER active nature with a low Tafel slope of 36 mV dec−1, a high geometric exchange current density of ∼0.955 mA cm−2, and a small overpotential of 42 mV at a standard current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4. Additionally, the VS2 nanoplates exhibited long-term stability toward the HER. The direct contact between VS2 and carbon paper (i.e. current collector) possibly enhanced charge carrier transport, and the array structure promoted the release of evolved hydrogen gas bubbles from the catalyst surface and enhanced the HER performance. Qu et al.463 fabricated 1T-VS2 nanoflowers via a facile hydrothermal approach. In acid environments, the prepared VS2 nanoflowers showed a similar HER performance to Pt, with an ultra-low onset potential of ∼32 mV, and a Tafel slope of ∼34 mV dec−1. High long-term stability and almost 100% faradaic efficiency indicates the potential practical application of VS2 nanoflowers in the HER. From a first principles analysis, it was observed that thermoneutral Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption on both the basal and edge sites and the conductivity of the 1T-VS2 nanoflowers are key factors for increased HER performance. Theoretical simulations have indicated the potential of TaS2 as an active and stable electrocatalyst. Shi et al.464 prepared ultrathin 2H-TaS2 films on gold foil by low pressure CVD (LPCVD). Notably, the values of ΔGH* for Ta-edge, S-edge, and basal-plane were calculated to be −0.04, −0.10, and 0.15 eV, respectively. These results specified that the active sites of 2H-TaS2 are focused both at the edges and in the basal-planes, which is in sharp contrast with MoS2 that has inert surface catalytic properties. As shown in Fig. 29, 2H-TaS2 flakes with different thicknesses revealed a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the overpotentials (η) of 2H-TaS2 films were 65–150 mV, yielding Tafel slopes of 31, 33–42, and 110 mV dec−1 for Pt, 2H-TaS2/Au and Au foil, respectively, indicating the exceptional HER activity of 2H-TaS2. It is notable that the Tafel slope ∼33 mV dec−1 for 2H-TaS2, is close to that of platinum ∼31 mV dec−1 and exceeded those reported for metal sulfides. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic performances of mono-metal sulfides suggest that alloying and/or composite formation could be an effective method to improve the electrocatalytic activity of metal sulfides, which can increase their areal density of exposed active sites for catalysis.

6.2 HER capacitated by bi-metal sulfides
It is believed that bi-metallic sulfides can demonstrate improved intrinsic HER activity compared to binary systems or mono-metallic sulfides, these will now be discussed.

6.2.1 MoSx and WSx based bi-metal sulfides. 
The abundant and cost-effective inorganic catalyst based on Cu2MoS4 was reported by Tran et al.465 Cu2MoS4 displayed a highly active nature in aqueous electrolyte solutions over a wide range of pH values from 0–7 with only a low ∼135 mV overpotential, an apparent exchange current density of ∼0.040 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of ∼95 mV dec−1, irrespective of the pH value. This Cu2MoS4 catalyst was found to be highly stable through electrocatalytic HER and it is believed that this catalyst will be an attractive alternative to platinum. Moreover, ternary sulfides of nickel tungsten sulfide (NiWSx) and cobalt tungsten sulfide (CoWSx) which have WS2-like layered assemblies and comprise MII–S–WIV (M = Co or Ni) bi-metallic sulfide centres.466 These MWSx materials are highly electroactive for the HER with only a modest overpotential, as shown in Fig. 30. The catalytic activities were centered on MIIS clusters whereas the WS2 framework is expected to be related to the role of a coordination ligand that stabilizes and adjusts HER activity. Under a neutral pH based hydrogen evolution, NiWSx, CoWSx and CoMoSx catalysts showed a low overpotential of 165, 95 and 75 mV respectively.466 Moreover, values for Tafel slope were determined to be ∼96 mV dec−1 for NiWSx, ∼78 mV dec−1 for CoWSx, and ∼85 mV dec−1 for CoMoSx, as previously reported for amorphous MoS2 and M-promoted MoS2 catalysts ∼86–96 mV dec−1,467 and this was indicative of substrate mass-transport limitation within the catalytic films. In addition, the exchange current densities were calculated to be ∼10−5.66 A cm−2 for NiWSx and ∼10−5.25 A cm−2 for CoWSx and the CoMoSx showed 10−5.89 A cm−2. The MS centres and Co as the second metal (M) resulted in improvement of both the intrinsic catalytic properties and active electrochemical surface area, as a result, CoWSx displayed improved catalytic performance.

Similarly, the HER activity in an acid electrolyte of a new ternary bi-metallic sulfide of Ag2WS4 was reported by Zhan et al.255 It is remarkable that the Ag2WS4 showed an onset potential of ∼−212 mV (vs. RHE) and a low overpotential of 329 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of ∼62 mV dec−1. The results demonstrated that the enhanced performance was attributed to its unique chemical composition, large electrochemically active surface area, and high electric conductivity compared to bare WS2 and Ag2S. Due to the synergistic benefits of bi-metallic sulfides as well as interwoven carbon nanosheets for efficient mass/charge transport, the NiWS/CF electrode exhibited an excellent HER performance in different pH media.468 For example, under acid and alkaline environments the NiWS/CF revealed a low overpotential of ∼56 mV and ∼38 mV to generate 10 mA cm−2, which is much smaller than NiS2/CF, WS2/CF and NiO/CF. Recently, several materials including CoMoS4,469,470 CoMoS3,469 and NiMoS4469 have been widely investigated in acidic or alkaline media due to their promising HER activity, low cost, simple preparation, and high stability.


6.2.2 M1−xCoxSy (M = Ni, Fe, Cu) based bi-metal sulfides. 
The chemical composition of an electrocatalysts has a large impact on its electrochemical performance. Tie et al.471 prepared different compositions and mixed phases of NiCo2S4 produced by a solvothermal method. The electrochemical measurements showed that NiCo2S4 with a theoretical Ni/Co molar ratio of 1:2 (NCS-1) demonstrated a superior HER performance in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte with a lower overpotential of 282 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The enhanced performance was mainly due to the flake-like structure, optimal chemical composition and relatively small resistance. A recent approach for direct growth of 1D NW arrays of NiCo2S4 on a nickel foam (NF) was described by Sivanantham et al.405 The binder-free NiCo2S4 NW/NF electrode provided a HER current density of ∼10 mA cm−2 at a small overpotential of 210 mV vs. RHE in 1 M KOH. The nickel foam assists in the directional growth, revealing more active sites of the NiCo2S4 for electrocatalytic reactions at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Peng et al.472 reported the fabrication of NWs of Ni0.33Co0.67S2 on titanium foil via sulfuration of a NiCo2O4 precursor. The NWs of Ni0.33Co0.67S2 had a high HER activity in 0.5 M H2SO4, with a low overpotential of ∼73, 87, and 118 mV vs. RHE required to achieve HER current densities of 10, 20, and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. These values are smaller than those for NiS2 and CoS2, however due to the dissolution of sulfides in 0.5 M H2SO4 the HER current generated by Ni0.33Co0.67S2 rapidly diminished.
Kong et al.439 prepared iron cobalt sulfides with different compositions where Fe0.43Co0.57S2 demonstrated the best HER activity and long-term stability in acid compared to other sulfides such as Ni0.68Co0.32S2, FeS2, CoS2 and NiS2. Importantly, the HER activity of Ni0.68Co0.32S2 was lower than FeS2, CoS2 and NiS2. Hence, the optimization of chemical composition is essential to achieve more electrochemical active sites. Similarly, a ternary catalyst of FexCo1−xSy was prepared using the ALD method.473 Compositional optimization indicated that Fe0.54Co0.46S0.92 was the best arrangement for enhanced HER activity, and it was then modified to form a Fe0.54Co0.46S0.92/CNTs/CC electrode. The modified electrode exhibited a low HER overpotential of ∼−70 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in an alkaline solution, which demonstrated the efficiency of the ALD-based structural engineering approach. Yang et al.474 reported the in situ hydrothermal sulfidization of a hierarchical nanoarray of CuCo2S4 on copper foam (CuCo2S4/CF) from a precursor of CuCo2–OH nanowire array. The as-prepared CuCo2S4/CF showed superior HER activity in 1.0 M KOH, with overpotentials of only ∼259 and ∼295 mV to achieve current densities of 60 and 100 mA cm−2 respectively. Furthermore, a high turnover frequency with strong electrochemical durability values of 0.069 and 0.390 mol s−1 O2 at overpotentials of 300 and 400 mV were achieved, respectively.

6.3 Strategies for enhancing HER performance
As shown in Scheme 2, several strategies have beed widely used to advance the mono-metal or bi-metal sulfide systems. They are discussed in detail below.
 Scheme 2  Systematic of approaches to improve the activity of metal sulfide systems. 

6.3.1 Effects of constructing heterostructures. 
Research groups have investigated the advancement of low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts for HER.461,475–480 Liu et al.481 reported the combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) to examine a NiCo2S4@NiFe heterostructure interface for enhanced water-splitting activity. Using the facile hydrothermal method, NiCo2S4 nanotubes, NiFe LDH nanosheets, and NiCo2S4@NiFe LDH heterostructures were prepared on nickel foam, of which the corresponding experimental HER performance exhibited little enhancement, with a small overpotential of ∼200 mV at 10 mA cm−2. The DFT results revealed that the electron-rich region of NiCo2S4 and a hole-rich region of NiFe LDH sheet, initiating the movement of the Fermi energy. As a result, the interface between NiFe LDH and NiCo2S4 has substantial effects on the activity of electrocatalysts. Significantly, a 3D heteromorphic NiCo2S4/Ni3S2 nanosheet network has been made on nickel foam (NiCo2S4/Ni3S2/NF) using a NiCo-layered hydroxide precursor.482 The resultant NiCo2S4/Ni3S2/NF electrode exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic HER performance with a low onset overpotential of ∼15 mV at 10 mV cm−2 and long-term durability in an alkaline solution. In addition, the Tafel slope of NiCo2S4/Ni3S2/NF electrode was ∼105.2 mV dec−1, which was smaller than those of NiCo-LDH/NF (∼142.3 mV dec−1), NiCo2S4/NF (∼147.3 mV dec−1), Ni3S2/NF (∼156.5 mV dec−1), and bare Ni foam (∼196.5 mV dec−1). Such an improved HER activity was accredited to (i) the open active sites provided by the mixed transition metal sulfides (NiCo2S4 and Ni3S2), (ii) the robust interfacial contact at the NiCo2S4/Ni3S2 heterojunction interfaces with the bound H binding, and (iii) the highly porous and conductive substrate of the NF with improved electron transfer.
Owing to the synergistic effect of facile electron transfer between CdS, MoO3 and Ni3S2/NF and the well-designed structure, as shown in Fig. 31(i), an ultrathin CdS layered MoO3/Ni3S2 hierarchical nanoarray on a NF resulted in an excellent low overpotential of ∼30 mV at −10 mA cm−2, which exceeded the existing non-noble electrocatalysts.483 MoS2/Ni3S2 nanorod arrays that were highly-aligned on an a nickel foam (MoS2/Ni3S2/NF) acted as a novel 3D hierarchical electrode.484 Each Ni3S2 nanorod had a MoS2 coated structure, with large surface contact regions that provided outstanding catalytic activity and good stability for the HER. Aided by a decoratively designed architecture, the MoS2/Ni3S2/NF exhibited a catalytic current density of 10, 100, 200, and 300 mA cm−2, it only required 187, 274, 300, and 320 mV overpotentials respectively for HER, better than a benchmark combination. In addition, the 1D MoS2/Ni3S2 nanoarrays were grown on nickel foam by Cao et al.485 The MoS2/Ni3S2 Ni composite had an onset potential ∼13 mV in 1 M KOH, which was similar to a Pt-based electrocatalyst for HER. Moreover, the functional overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 is ∼76 mV for the 3D MoS2/Ni3S2/Ni hybrid composite, which are lower than those of the Ni3S2/Ni nanostructure (∼260 mV) and nickel foam (∼350 mV).

Recently, effort has been made to improve the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 through creating more active sites and enhancing the charge transfer rate. Chen et al.486 demonstrated the sulfur concentration effect on MoS2, where the metallic phase transition of VO2 showed a significant effect on hydrogen evolution properties of a MoS2/VO2 hybrid heterostructure. Upon the insulator to metal phase transition of VO2, the MoS2/VO2 hybrid exhibited a low onset potential and small Tafel slope of ∼99 mV dec−1 and 85 mV dec−1, respectively. This was accredited to the improved charge transport ability and interfacial strain effect on modifying the electronic structure of MoS2 and increasing the conductivity. In addition, an array of 3D self-supported nickel-oxide-coated cobalt manganese sulfide nanosheets on a carbon cloth (CoMn–S@NiO/CC) was used as an efficient electrocatalysts for HER in alkaline media.487 The performance of CoMn–S@NiO/CC was improved through the HER current densities of ∼100 and 200 mA cm−2 at low overpotentials of ∼232 and 278 mV, respectively in 1.0 M KOH, with long-term stability for hydrogen production; see Fig. 31(ii). Such a high HER activity for CoMn–S@NiO/CC was a result of Co ions, which improves the amorphous nature thereby increasing the electrocatalytic active surface area. Since hierarchical nanostructured materials are of interest for energy storage and harvesting, V2O5@Ni3S2 was prepared by Zhong et al.488 Owing to the structural features and coupling effect of the V2O5@Ni3S2 interface and V–S active bonding between vanadium pentoxide and nickel sulfide the V2O5@Ni3S2 catalyst has an overpotential of 95 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with a low Tafel value of 107.9 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH.
Decorated metal sulfides are also of interest for energy materials applications. Recently, CdS quantum dot (QD) decorated Ni3S2 flowers were deposited on a plasma-treated nickel foam (PNF i.e. NiO).489 The NiO created during the plasma treatment showed a rich number of active sites, which plays a significant role in alkaline based HER. Specifically, a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was attained for the HER with a ∼121 mV overpotential with Tafel slope of ∼110 mV dec−1, when the working electrode was 1 mM CdS/Ni3S2/PNF catalyst in 1 M KOH. In addition, a WO3·2H2O/WS2 hybrid catalyst490 revealed excellent HER performance with a current density of 100 mA cm−2 at a 152 mV overpotential with a Tafel slope of ∼54 mV dec−1. Recently, by adjusting the amount of WS2, Zhou et al.491 prepared highly active 3D hierarchical CoS2 nanosheets combined with WS2 (CoS2@WS2) via a one-step sulfurization method. It was established that the creation of nano-interfaces of Co–S–W between CoS2 and WS2 was responsible for the outstanding HER activity. As a result, a low overpotential of ∼−97.2 mV at −10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of ∼66.0 mV dec−1, and high electrochemical stability was observed for the CoS2@WS2 hybrid electrocatalyst. Similarly, other heterostructures of WS2–WS3,492 MoOx/Ni3S2,493 MoS2–CoSe2494 also have beed used for HER.


6.3.2 Effects of doping. 
Tuning the catalyst composition by doping single metal or non-metals has been considered as a universal way to advance catalytic activity. This form of doping, including cations and anions, such as metals and/or nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon can alter the electronic structure with small effects on the crystal structure to create abundant active sites, leading to elevated adsorption energy and enhanced electrocatalytic performance.495,496 Therefore, combining structure design and anion and/or metal doping is a favorable strategy to alter the electronic structure and increase the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts.
6.3.2.1 Anion doped metal sulfides. 
Recently, heterostructures of Ni3S2/VS2 with nitrogen doping showed superior electrocatalysis for HER activity. The N-doped Ni3S2/VS2 (N-Ni3S2/VS2) revealed a high electrocatalytic HER performance with a low overpotential of ∼151 mV at 10 mA cm−2, since N-doping improves conductivity and increases the number of catalytic active sites,497 see Fig. 32(i). Oxygen doped amorphous CoSx film was prepared by Sultana et al.498 and due to its structural features, during HER an onset potential of 220 mV vs. RHE with a lower Tafel slope of 72 mV dec−1 was attained, moreover it showed long-term stability over 24 h in a neutral pH. The HER activity of the O-CoSx film is comparable to highly crystalline cobalt sulfide materials. In addition, DFT calculations indicated that a reduced S–Co coordination number, as encountered in amorphous materials, leads to an optimum binding energy for hydrogen adsorption (Hads) on the material which facilitates electron transfer kinetics.

To achieve efficient conversion, the modification of material composition is important and in this aspect, vertically aligned oxygenated-CoS2–MoS2 (O-CoMoS) hetero-nanosheets were grown on flexible carbon fiber cloth by Hou et al.499 In comparison to different oxygen doped metal sulfides such as O-FeMoS, O-NiMoS, and MoS2 nanosheet arrays, the O-CoMoS hetero-nanosheets array revealed a low overpotential of ∼97 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in an alkaline solution for the HER; see Fig. 32(ii). The Tafel slopes of as-prepared O-CoMoS, O-NiMoS, and O-FeMoS arrays were 70, 80, and 123 mV dec−1, respectively, indicating promising HER reaction kinetics for the O-CoMoS array. This was mainly due to the disordered structure of the O-CoMoS, which exposed the active heterointerfaces, facile charge transport on 2D conductive carbon channels, and abundant active catalytic sites from the synergistic effect of the heterostructures, thereby achieving an enhanced HER performance.
6.3.2.2 Cation doped metal sulfides. 
Due to improved performance, relatively low cost and high stability, the doping of cations attracted attention in the energy conversion process. In this regard, vanadium (V) doped Ni3S2 nanowire arrays on nickel foam were reported by Qu et al.500 It was observed that, at low temperatures, the doping of vanadium (V) can stimulate the formation of Ni3S2 nanowires. V doped Ni3S2 nanowires exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity, and outperformed pristine Ni3S2 and other Ni3S2-based compounds. The nanowires had a low overpotential of ∼68 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a relatively low Tafel slope of 112 mV dec−1 with long-term stability (∼1000 cycles) and increased faradaic efficiency. The onset potential of V-doped Ni3S2 nanowires was as low as ∼39 mV, which is similar to platinum. From first-principle calculations, V-doping in Ni3S2 enriches the free carrier density near the Fermi level, resulting in improved catalytic active sites. Zhang et al.501 fabricated vertically oriented Fe-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet array on a 3D Ni foam (Fe-Ni3S2/NF). During their experiments it was observed that the metal sites were found to contribute mainly to the HER activity of Fe-Ni3S2/NF; Fe-doping could also improve the water adsorption ability and optimize the hydrogen adsorption energy of Ni3S2, which resulted in the enhancement of HER activity on Fe-Ni3S2/NF in terms of the overpotentials of 47, 142 and 232 mV vs. RHE, at current densities of ∼10, 20 and 100 mA cm−2 respectively, for Fe17.5%-Ni3S2/NF.
The fabrication of single layer nanosheets with high-yields remains a challenge. In this aspect, Zeng et al.502 prepared single-layer Pt–TiS2 and Pt–TaS2 nanosheets using exfoliated TiS2 and TaS2 nanosheets. It is significant that the Pt–TiS2 exhibited a similar current density to the commercial Pt–C catalyst on the basis of equivalent platinum loading levels. In addition, both Pt–TiS2 and Pt–TaS2 catalysts offered an increased electrocatalytic activity in HER compared to pure nanosheets of TiS2 and TaS2, respectively. The calculated Tafel slopes for Pt–C, Pt–TiS2 and TiS2 were ∼34.4, ∼40.6 and ∼102.5 V dec−1, respectively. This indicated that the catalytic reaction of Pt–TiS2 benefits from the grouping of Volmer–Tafel and Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanisms, as shown in Fig. 32(iii). In addition, the Pt–TiS2 and Pt–TaS2 hybrid materials showed long-term stability after 1000 cycles.


6.3.3 HER activity of carbon/graphene based metal sulfide composites. 
Hybridizing electrocatalysts with various highly active materials such as organic compounds of CNT and/or graphene enables uniform growth of nanostructures with large surface areas and greater surface roughness to increase the number of active sites, contribute to electrolyte movement, and solve the aggregation of active sites through an anchoring effect with a substrate, while decreasing the contact resistance and increasing the electrical conductivity with substrates.41,420,503–510 Wang et al.420 developed a highly active and stable catalyst of Co doped FeS2 nanosheets hybridized with carbon nanotubes (Fe1−xCoxS2/CNT hybrid) for HER in acidic solutions. The hybrid of Fe0.9Co0.1S2/CNT showed a low overpotential of ∼0.12 V at 20 mA cm−2, with a lower Tafel slope of ∼46 mV dec−1, and long-term durability over 40 h during HER operation. A DFT study showed that the high HER activity of hybrid Fe0.9Co0.1S2/CNT was due to the strong heteroatom interactions between CNT and Fe0.9Co0.1S2.
In addition, nitrogenated carbon materials with metal sulfides are also of interest for energy materials. In this aspect, Pramoda et al.511 prepared nanosheets of C3N4/MoS2 with nitrogenated rGO (NrGO) for HER activity. The cross-linked C3N4–NrGO (∼−0.36 V with Tafel value of 88 mV dec−1) hybrid revealed an onset potential shift of 60 mV as compared to that of a physical mixture of C3N4–NrGO (−0.42 V with Tafel value of ∼95 mV dec−1). It was observed that covalent cross-linking of 2D materials to produce hetero-assemblies or nanocomposites may have a valuable effect on catalytic activity.
Preparing metal sulfides with carbon materials will also provide enriched electrocatalytic active sites to increase HER performance.512 In this aspect, using slightly oxidized GO as a support, Li et al.41 prepared MoS2/rGO hybrid via a solvothermal method. The prepared hybrid catalyst revealed few-layer MoS2 nanostructure with numerous wide-open edges slanted onto graphene, which exhibited exceptional HER catalytic activity with a low overpotential of ∼100 mV and a Tafel slope of ∼41 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4, which is smaller than amorphous MoS2 (∼40 mV dec−1). However, the large number of catalytic edge sites on the MoS2, as well as the excellent electrical coupling to the graphene system, led to a highly active HER catalyst. Covalently attached amorphous MoSx on rGO was prepared by Lee et al.513 Owing to the structural features, this linking of MoSx and rGO led to a highly efficient HER reaction at a low overpotential of ∼−157 mV and small Tafel slope of ∼41 mV dec−1 with 95% versus original activity after ∼1000 cycles. It was observed that the improved HER activity was attributed to the creation of a facile bridge by oxygen atoms between MoSx and GO which played a crucial role in control of planar MoSx growth, and improvement of exposed active sulfur sites. Similarly, Kumar et al.514 observed that at a lower activation energy ∼17–6 kJ mol−1, the MoS2/GO and MoS2/rGO hybrid provides faster HER reactions in an acid medium. Ghosh et al.515 measured a Tafel value of ∼41.7 mV dec−1 with ∼3000 cycles long-term stability for a MoS2–rGO hybrid, via the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism. Using the hydrothermal method, Li et al.516 prepared a composite of Cu and MoS2 on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (Cu–MoS2/rGO) for the HER process. It was observed that the coverage of rGO enhanced the electrical conductivity of the Cu–MoS2/rGO catalyst, and a higher number of exposed edges via the formation of a nanoflower structure of MoS2. As a result, the Cu–MoS2/rGO (12 wt%) catalyst displayed a high HER activity with a current density of ∼83.6 mA cm−2 at −400 mV, which was ∼1.6 times higher than a MoS2/rGO (∼53.7 mA cm−2) catalyst. The Cu and rGO contents not only increase the electrical conductivity of the catalyst, but also promoted catalytic activity via a synergistic effect with MoS2 nanoflowers. Similarly, a hybrid composite of double-decked MoS2 nanosheets and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets dotted with CoS2 nanoparticles (CoS2@MoS2/rGO) was prepared by Guo et al.517 Compared to bare materials such as CoS2/rGO and MoS2/rGO, the CoS2@MoS2/rGO demonstrated a greater HER activity with a lower overpotential of ∼98 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 37.4 mV dec−1, as well as excellent cyclic stability, and at ∼175 mV it reached 100 mA cm−2. From their DFT analysis it was observed that the hydrogen adsorption free energy of CoS2@MoS2/rGO was close to zero.
In addition, a PVP-assisted hydrothermal technique was adapted to synthesise WS2/rGO hybrids.518 The optimized catalyst of monolayered mWS2–rGO exhibited remarkable HER activity with a current density of ∼10 mA cm−2 at a small overpotential of ∼170 mV. This enhanced HER performance was attributed to the abundant active edges, high surface area, and a conducting link between mono-layered WS2 and rGO. Lately, Chen et al.519 prepared ternary hybrids of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/tungsten disulfide (WS2)/tungsten trioxide (WO3) for the HER process. The resultant hybrids had a spherical structure made by crumpled graphene and WS2/WO3 nanorods. The crumpled graphene/WS2/WO3 (CGTH) catalyst displayed a superior electrocatalytic activity in terms of small Tafel slope ∼37 mV dec−1 and a low onset potential of 96 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Compared with the pristine catalysts, this hybrid composite showed improved catalytic activities for the HER. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 33(i), Seo et al.476 combined experimental and computational investigations for electrocatalysts based on a monolayer WS2 nanoplates on carbon from WSx nanoclusters (WSx@OMC) prepared via different sulfidation times. Notably, the electrocatalyst of WSx@OMC synthesized at a short sulfidation time contained large number of WSx nanoclusters, and showed higher HER activity than the catalyst prepared at a long sulfidation time. Owing to these features, the 20% WSx@OMC catalysts showed good HER performance at a current density of ∼10 mA cm−2 in the overpotential range of ∼213 mV with a small Tafel value of ∼74 mV dec−1. The enhanced performance was attributed to the controlled loading in 20% WSx@OMC which exposed a large amount of active sites. In addition, Cu nanodot (ND)-decorated Ni3S2 nanotubes (NTs) on carbon fibers (CFs) (Cu NDs/Ni3S2 NTs–CFs) was tested as an electrocatalyst for HER activity in alkaline media.520 The Cu NDs/Ni3S2 NTs–CFs exhibited a low onset potential of ∼60 mV, and an overpotential of ∼128 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which was comparable to Ni3S2 NTs–CFs (∼189 mV), Cu NDs–CFs (>300 mV), and CFs (>300 mV). In addition, the Tafel slope of Cu NDs/Ni3S2 NTs–CFs at a low overpotential interval between 0.01 and 0.20 V was only ∼76.2 mV dec−1, which was much smaller than those of pristine Ni3S2 NTs–CFs (∼125.7 mV dec−1), Cu NDs–CFs (∼166.7 mV dec−1), and CFs (∼168.4 mV dec−1).

Likewise, P, N, O doped graphene with 1T-WS2 nanolayers as a heterostructure film was prepared by Duan et al.521 Due to the highly exposed active centers on 2D 1T-WS2 nanolayers, the extended surface, and continuous conductive network of these heterostructure exhibited a small overpotential of ∼125 mV vs. RHE with a current density of ∼10 mA cm−2, which is close to commercial Pt/C under N2 saturated 0.5 M H2SO4. In addition, the strong synergistic effects between the components exhibited the smallest Tafel slope of ∼52.7 mV dec−1 as compared to WS2@N, O-graphene film ∼180.61 mV dec−1, WS2 nanolayers ∼103.2 mV dec−1, and P, N, O-graphene film ∼183.0 mV dec−1, demonstrating the highest HER rate and favorable kinetics of heterostructured WS2@P, N, O-graphene films as shown in Fig. 33(ii). Several other metal sulfide composites and hybrid structures have been reported for HER activity353,522–525 and their enhanced performance is summarized in Table 4.

6.3.4 Effects of edge sites and defects engineering. 
Defects are well-known to strongly interrupt the local density of states in metal sulfide crystal structures and produce extra energy levels among the valence and conduction bands.526,527 Typically, most of the metal sulfide basal surfaces are catalytically passive for HER activity. In order to increase the catalytic activity of the plane, reactive sites can be produced by the introduction of defects. As a result, the electronic properties of the metal sulfide catalysts can be adjusted. In addition, owing to the edge sites, many of the metal sulfides exhibit high electrocatalytic activity. This is thought to make unsaturated sulfur atoms at the edges, which is directed to the amorphous metal sulfide systems.445,528 Moreover, edge sites can be created by increasing the density of structural defects on the metal sulfides.529–531 As a result, several types of defects have been detected in metal sulfides.532–536 Accordingly, a limited number of studies have focused on the impact of defects of metal sulfides on the HER activity. However, it is important to discern the role of defects, since defect controlled manufacturing can provide advanced approaches for improving the density of active sites or enhancing the basal plane conductivity of the metal sulfides.
The design of high-performance electrocatalytic HER reactions requires emergent strategies for defect engineering or oxygen vacancy control and understanding the relationship between dislocations and electrochemical performance. Usually, physical and chemical defects can be produced by O2 plasma or Ar plasma to adjust the electronic properties and provide activity of the inert in-plane S atoms of MS2 (M = Mo or W or V etc.). Among other metal sulfides, MoS2 is a promising and low-cost material for electrochemical hydrogen generation owing to its high activity and long-term stability. However, the efficiency of HER is restricted by the number of active sites in MoS2, for example edges in MoS2 catalysts. In this aspect, Ye et al.537 created defects on a monolayer MoS2via oxygen plasma exposure and hydrogen treatment, which led to dense exposed edges and a substantial enhancement in hydrogen evolution reactions. The corresponding HER performance of MoS2 samples with hydrogen annealing was also evaluated, see Fig. 34(i). In addition, the HER activity of pristine MoS2 with hydrogen annealing temperatures of 400, 500, and 600 °C were tested. When compared to bare MoS2 without annealing, it was observed that an annealing treatment reduced the onset overpotential and increased the current density. It is worth noting that MoS2 annealed under 500 °C displayed the lowest overpotential (∼300 mV) compared to 400 °C (∼470 mV) and 600 °C (∼450 mV). These results revealed that HER performance increases with an increased number of defects since the creation of large amounts of macro- and micro-size triangular holes provided more catalytic active sites for the HER.

(e) HER property hydrogen treated MoS2 (f) Tafel plots show hydrogen-annealed MoS2 has lower Tafel slope than MoS2 without any treatment, revealing improved electrochemical activity of MoS2 as a HER catalyst after hydrogen annealing.

Reproduced from ref. 543 with permission from Royal Society of Chemistry, copyright 2018. 
In addition to plasma treatment, chemical functionalization also plays a significant role in creating defects. In this aspect, Xie et al.442 reported on the impact of defects on MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets for electrocatalytic HER, where the defects were increased using thiourea to convert Mo(VI) to Mo(IV) during the solvothermal method. The highly defective MoS2 structure introduces additional active edge sites on the ultrathin nanosheets, which increased their electrocatalytic performance under acidic environment, thereby achieving a high cathodic current density of ∼13 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential, small Tafel slope of ∼50 mV dec−1 and excellent durability. Furthermore, by exploiting a liquid-ammonia-assisted lithiation method, Yin et al.538 prepared porous metallic 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets with abundant edge sites and a large concentration of S-vacancies. As a consequence, HER activity for a porous 1T-MoS2 revealed a current density of ∼10 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential of ∼154 mV and small Tafel slope of 43 mV dec−1. A first principle study on the defect engineering for assisting the hydrogen evolution has been conducted which revealed that, when a defect is formed, a dangling bond nearer to the Fermi energy is created with more suitable adsorption energies for hydrogen evolution reactions. Liu et al.539 studied the alkaline HER kinetics of Ru coupled defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets, whereby Ru created water dissociation and nearby defect-rich MoS2 allowed promising hydrogen adsorption for recombination into H2. As shown in Fig. 34(ii), the Ru/MoS2 catalyst exhibited a remarkable catalytic activity in terms of low overpotential of ∼−13 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with long-term stability after 12 h or 1000 cycles, which was greater than commercial 20 wt% Pt/C (∼−78 mV).
In addition to MoS2 and WS2, 2D VS2 nanomaterials have emerged as highly efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the HER. As with the extensively studied 2H-phase MoS2 basal plane, both 2H- and 1T-phase VS2 basal planes exhibit higher catalytic activity due to their metallic properties. Recently, Zhang et al.540 predicted a DFT model for the HER activity of 2D VS2 with various intrinsic point defects and it was observed that the V-rich form provides high HER activity. This was performed with the introduction of intrinsic point defects on the VS2 basal planes; as a result they found four types of stable defects in the 2H phase such as Sad, Svac, Vad, and VS and three kinds of stable defects in 1T phase such as Sad, Svac, and Vad. Additionally, it was observed that the development of Svac, Vad, and VS structures in the 2H phase and Vad in the 1T phase can increase the HER activity of basal planes. In order to investigate the activity of the defect rich VS2, Zhang et al.541 prepared defect rich VS2 nanosheets via the solvothermal method. They attained defect rich VS2 nanosheets, in which they also observed an expanded (001) interlayer spacing as high as 1.00 nm, which was expanded by 74% as compared to the pristine VS2 (∼0.575 nm). The interlayer extended VS2 nanosheets exhibited outstanding HER activity, with a small overpotential of ∼43 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, a low Tafel slope of ∼36 mV dec−1, and long-term durability of ∼60 h without any decrease in current. The HER performance of this expanded interlayered VS2 nanosheets was superior to pristine VS2 with a normal interlayer spacing and commercial Pt/C. The excellent electrocatalytic HER activity was accredited to the expanded interlayer space and rich defects.
Notably, there are four types of NbS2 phases available; two stoichiometric and two non-stoichiometric phases including – 2H NbS2 and 3R NbS2 and 2H Nb1+xS2 and 3R Nb1+xS2, respectively.542 Using an Ar plasma treatment, Gopalakrishnan et al.543 prepared a defect rich 3R-NbS2 polymorph structure with semiconducting behavior and abundant catalytic defect sites of nanoflakes of NbS2 for HER activity. However, the defect free NbS2/rGO composite revealed an enhanced HER catalyst in terms of small onset potential, low Tafel value and improved exchange current density, see Fig. 34(iii).
Recently, the creation of defects by a plasma has attracted attention in functionalizing the catalytic inert basal plane of metal sulfides. Li et al.522 prepared a high density of atomic-scale pores in a 2D TaS2 surface to improve the HER activity via an oxygen plasma treatment. As a result, the intrinsic relationship between the HER and edge defects were revealed. The onset potential of HER was reduced from 302, 200, to 225 mV with a rise of exposure period varying from 5, 10 to 15 min, respectively. Similarly, 2D metallic TaS2 was prepared by Huan et al.544 using CVD. Owing to its electrocatalytic active edge sites, vertically oriented 1T-TaS2 nanosheets on nanoporous gold substrate had excellent performance with a high exchange current density of ∼67.61 μA cm−2 with Tafel slopes of 67–82 mV dec−1. In addition, metallic vanadium-doped NiS2 nanosheets displayed outstanding electrocatalytic HER performance with small overpotential of ∼290 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with high durability in 1 M KOH solutions.545 This enhanced performance was attributed to the well-designed atomic defects in V-doped NiS2, which was created by a vanadium displacement defect. Likewise, Ni3S2–rGO nanosheets on nickel foam (Ni3S2–rGO@NF) prepared by one-step hydrothermal process546 showed an enhanced HER performance in terms of an onset potential as low as ∼0 mV, which is comparable to Pt, and only a low overpotential of ∼44 mV is needed to reach ∼10 mA cm−2 with a high stability.546


6.3.5 Annealing temperature effects. 
As the temperature of the semiconducting materials is increased, the valence band electrons gain adequate energy to outflow from the confines of their atoms. As a consequence, at higher temperatures the valence electrons in semiconducting materials are free and the electrical resistivity falls.547,548 However, if the temperature increases, the grain size of the semiconducting material will increase and hence an optimum elevated temperature treatment is essential. By using ultra-high vacuum (UHV), Jaramillo et al.414 prepared MoS2 on an Au(111) surface, which was annealed at 400 °C or 500 °C. The MoS2 samples possessed Tafel slopes between 55 and 60 mV dec−1 irrespective of annealing temperature. In addition, MoS2/SiO2 was prepared by Sobczynski549 from MoS3/SiO2, by varying the annealing temperature. It was revealed that the catalytic activity of MoS2/SiO2 reduced with an increase of calcination temperature.
Wu et al.435 prepared WS2 nanosheets via ball milling, followed by annealing at 600–700 °C. However, inorganic fullerene such as WS2 (IF-WS2) was obtained only above 800 °C. The uneven nanosheets and associated structural features, such as separate NSs with loosely arranged layers, provided highly open edges as active catalytic sites. The WS2 nanosheets had a HER current density of ∼9.66 mA cm−2 with a small overpotential of ∼−150 mV, which was ∼8.6 times higher than commercial MoS2 (∼1.12 mA cm−2). Lukowski et al.550 prepared a metallic 1T-WS2 polymorph from the conversion of as-grown 2H-WS2 by heating the samples in n-butyllithium medium at 80 °C for 48 h; a microwave-assisted higher temperature method was used to accelerate the intercalation procedure. As a result, 1T-WS2 nanosheets revealed improved electrocatalytic HER activity and required only a small overpotential of ∼−75 mV vs. RHE to attain 10 mA cm−2 with a small Tafel value of ∼−70 mV dec−1. This enhanced HER performance was attributed to the controlled nanostructure, structural polymorphs and optimum temperature.
In addition, 3D hybrids of WS2/graphene/Ni foam showed high HER activity after annealing at 450 °C,551 and revealed a low Tafel slope of ∼43 mV dec−1, and a high current density of 10 mA cm−2 at −119 mV vs. RHE and long-term durability. The enhancement was thought to be due to the good electrical contact between WS2 and graphene and porous structures of the nickel support. At 250 °C the annealed WS2 nanoribbons exhibited a decrease in HER activity,475 which could be due to the reduced electrical conductivity after annealing. In contrast, an enhanced electrocatalytic activity was observed for annealed MoS2 (450 °C) and its hybrid with rGO i.e. MoS2/rGO (450 °C).552 Compared to the annealed MoS2, the MoS2/rGO nanocomposite showed higher HER catalytic activity with a lower onset overpotential of ∼28 mV vs. RHE at current density of ∼10 mA cm−2, and a Tafel slope of ∼41.7 mV dec−1. This enhanced performance was attributed to the improved electrocatalytic active sites during annealing of MoS2/rGO.552
Recently, Wu et al.553 reported an annealing effect for N doped NiCo2S4 NWs. It was observed that with an increase of temperature the catalytic performance progressively increased and then achieved a maximum activity at 600 °C for annealed N–NiCo2S4. During H2 evolution testing, the 600 °C annealed N–NiCo2S4 sample exhibited an enhanced HER activity in terms of low overpotential of ∼41 mV vs. RHE at a current density of ∼10 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 35(i). Furthermore, it was seen that the HER performance decreased as the annealing temperature was further increased above 600 °C, which may be due to the aggregation of NW into bulk particles. As a result, N–NiCo2S4 annealed at 600 °C had a lower Tafel slope and smaller overpotential than Ni–Co–O, N–NiCoO, NiCo2S4, N–NiCo2S4, and commercial Pt/C in alkaline condition. In addition, the core–shell nanostructures provided facile electron transfer to enhance HER activity. By the solvothermal method,554 uniform Co9S8@MoS2 core–shell heterostructures were prepared and subjected to annealing treatments of 650, 750, and 850 °C for 3 h. As a result, the core–shell Co9S8@MoS2 catalyst annealed at 750 °C revealed HER performance with a low overpotential of ∼143 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of ∼117 mV dec−1 in alkaline environment. This performance was better than samples annealed at lower (650 °C) or higher (850 °C) temperatures. Meanwhile, the poor crystallinity and the bulk size nature of 650 °C and 850 °C annealed core–shell Co9S8@MoS2 samples showed a decrease in the electrocatalytic active sites. Moreover, at 650 °C the enhanced performance of annealed Co9S8@MoS2 catalysts was attributed to the core–shell structure that increased the synergistic effect of Co9S8 and MoS2 and provides catalytically active sites at higher temperature; see Fig. 35(ii).

Recently, Huang et al.552 prepared hollow polyhedral structured metal sulfides of MxCo3−xS4 (M = Zn, Ni, and Cu) via self-template strategy followed by annealing at 350 °C for 2 h. Remarkably, as shown in Fig. 35(iii), the hollow Zn0.30Co2.70S4 displayed an excellent HER activity compared to other metal sulfides of MxCo3−xS4 (M = Zn, Ni, and Cu) over a wide pH range, with low overpotentials of ∼80, ∼90, and ∼85 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and reached a current density of ∼100 mA cm−2 with low potentials of ∼129, ∼144, and ∼136 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 0.1 M phosphate buffer, and 1 M KOH, respectively.


6.3.6 Porosity effects. 
A porous nature and large surface area are key features that regulate the functional properties and performance of catalysts.436,555 Recently, unique 3D open/hollow architectures have shown promise for several energy conversion and storage applications. By a sulfurization method, Miao et al.556 prepared mesoporous FeS2. As a result of the mesoporous nature and more exposed (210) facets, the FeS2 exhibited a remarkable HER performance with a low overpotential of ∼96 mV at ∼10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of ∼78 mV dec−1 at a pH = 13. Theoretical analysis indicated that the excellent HER catalytic activity of mesoporous FeS2 was attributed to the exposed (210) facets. Similarly, due to additional catalytic active sites as a result of the large surface area ∼35.7 m2 g−1, the porous Ni3S2 nanorods showed an excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of ∼200 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline medium.557 Recently, Jiang et al.558 synthesized NiCo2S4 double-shelled ball-in-ball hollow spheres (BHSs) via a simple solvothermal route. Due to their structural features, optimum chemical composition, large surface area and distinct interior voids, the NiCo2S4 BHSs catalyst possessed a small onset overpotential ∼27.9 mV and a low overpotential of ∼89.7 mV at 10 mA cm−2 under alkaline conditions. Similarly, Wang et al.559 prepared 1D porous MS2/MO2 (M = W, Mo) nanorods for the HER. Due to its porous nature, the WS2/WO2 NRs showed an excellent HER activity with an overpotential of −160 mV at a current density of ∼15.0 mA cm−2, which was much larger than that observed for WO2 NRs (ca. 0.38 mA cm−2) and bulk WS2 (ca. 0.36 mA cm−2). At a low overpotential of ∼−200 mV, MoS2/MoO2-6 exhibited the highest cathodic current of ∼15.1 mA cm−2, which was higher than that of bulk MoS2 (0.85 mA cm−2) and MoO2 NRs (0.90 mA cm−2). Meanwhile, the enhanced performance of MS2/MO2 NRs was inherited from the highly porous nature, enhanced mass transport and conductive properties from their metallic dioxides for excellent HER activities and stabilities. In addition, highly porous MoS2/graphene aerogels (GMA) was prepared by Worsley et al.560 The graphene micro assemblies on MoS2 provided a large surface area of ∼700 m2 g−1 and an electrical conductivity of ∼112 S m−1. Due to the additional active sties as a result of the large surface area of the MoS2/graphene aerogel, the material exhibited promising HER performance with low onset potential of ∼100 mV and high current density of ∼100 mA cm−2 at 260 mV.
Recently, nano-shelled heterostructures of amorphous Ni(OH)2 with crystalline CuS mesoporous heterostructures were prepared by Liu et al.561 using a template technique. As shown in Fig. 36, due to the distinctive hollow mesoporous nanoshell features and the heterostructure synergetic effects among crystalline CuS and amorphous Ni(OH)2, the Ni(OH)2@CuS catalyst offered the facile electron transport with abundant active sites for HER. As a result, the Ni(OH)2@CuS catalyst revealed a smaller onset overpotential of ∼42 mV with a current density of ∼10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 186 mV. This HER activity was higher than the pristine Ni(OH)2, CuS and their mixtures. Likewise, due to the rich electroactive sites from nanoporous structures and the integration of highly conductive graphene, nanoballs of a porous NiS2/rGO hybrid562 exhibited an excellent HER activity in terms of high cathodic current density of ∼10 mA cm− 2 at a low overpotential of ∼−200 mV with a small Tafel slope of 52 mV dec−1, whereas the pristine porous nanoballs of NiS2 showed a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of ∼317 mV. Likewise, Zhu et al.563 prepared NiCo2S4 porous nanosheets on carbon cloth with a total pore volume of 0.228 mL g−1 and average pore radius of 1.818 nm by an anion exchange method. During HER testing, the porous nanosheets of NiCo2S4/CC exhibited a higher performance compared to nonporous NiCo2S4/NF. This enhanced performance was attributed to the metallic feature of the NiCo2S4 phase, intrinsic high activity and porous nanosheet features, which exposes more active catalytic sites and increases the diffusion of electrolyte.

6.4 Perspectives of electrochemical HER
The control of morphology is essential to understand the relationships between the structure and performance of metal sulfide materials in HER catalysis applications. For instance, the electrocatalytic catalytic performance of metal sulfide materials toward HER is strongly associated with the density of edge sites, defect concentration level, and its nano-scale morphology. Metal sulfides with a range of nanoscale morphologies have been developed, including truncated triangles, hexagons, flakes, ultrathin sheets, hierarchical, dendritic, and hollow structures. These catalysts also mostly possess highly porous structures, which are beneficial for electrolyte permeation. It is generally recognized that a high surface area can lead to more exposed catalytic active sites, which is favorable in achieving an optimum structure for enhanced HER activity. In addition, creating appropriate defects in materials such as metallic MoS2, WS2 and VS2 can improve HER performance by providing a highly conductive nature.
Other methods of improving performance include changing the composition of bi-metal sulfides, compared with mono-metal sulfides, to create a complex structure that can provide a synergistic coupling and structural effects to enhance the benefits of each metal and sulfide component. The doping of highly active nanoparticles of noble metals on metal sulfides can improve the number of exposed active sites and increase HER performance. Using highly conductive substrates such as carbon fibers or carbon cloth to load the metal sulfides also enhances the electron conduction and provides further electrocatalytic active sites. Notably, the development of metal–carbon bonds increases the catalyst stability to achieve a prolonged lifetime. Moreover, the formation of a heterojunction can enhance HER performance by tuning the nanostructure, electronic levels and providing more exposed active sites. During the electrochemical HER process, a lower onset potential, high cathodic current, greater turnover frequency (TOF), and lower Tafel slope values can be achieved. In addition, the stability of the catalyst can also be improved.
7 Photocatalytic hydrogen generations using metal sulfides
7.1 Mono-metal sulfides

7.1.1 MoS2 and ZnS photocatalysts. 
Typically metal sulfides with a tunable number of layers, high crystallinity, and edge and defect morphologies are crucial for high performance photocatalytic applications. Over recent decades, metal sulfides have been widely investigated as hydrogen evolution photocatalysts.7,36,373,407,458,564 Among them, MoS2 is extensively investigated as a result of its excellent stability, favorable electronic arrangement and light absorption properties. Moreover, bulk MoS2 has an indirect band gap of ∼1.2 eV, which is unsuitable for a photocatalytic response since it lacks oxidation/reduction potentials for initiating a photocatalytic reaction.565 However, 2D nanosheets of MoS2 have a direct band gap of ∼1.96 eV due to a quantum confinement effect, which provides MoS2 nanosheets with suitable band positions for visible-light absorption.436,566 Peng et al.567 prepared 2D single-layers of MoS2 nanosheets, in which well-designed heterojunctions are created between the different phases of semiconducting 2H, metallic 1T, and quasi-metallic 1T′ phases via exfoliated monolayers of MoS2. Remarkably, multi-phases of MoS2 provide optimum photocatalytic HER from the development of in-plane heterojunctions between 1T′ MoS2 and 2H MoS2. Significantly, this not only facilitates charge generation and light absorption by the 2H phase, but provides proficient charge separation at the 1T′/2H interface, and increases HER over the basal sites of 1T′ MoS2. In addition, due to the molecular mimic of MoS2 edge sites, Lei et al.568 attained a photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of ∼335 h−1 with a turnover number of ∼1570 for a thiomolybdate [Mo3S13]2− catalyst.568
Tanagida et al.569 reported that without a redox catalysts, colloidal ZnS was an efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen generation in the existence of electron donors such as MeOH, THF, EtOH, and TEA. Their findings revealed that colloidal ZnS fabricated in situ can assist in the transfer of photoinduced effective charge carriers. It was also reported570,571 that in the absence of sacrificial electron donors, colloidal ZnS experienced photocatalyst degradation upon irradiation of light, where the photocatalyst turned black after a small quantity of H2 evolution. In addition, ZnS in sacrificial SO32− solutions were used for photocatalytic H2 production under UV light irradiation with a quantum yield of ∼90% at 313 nm.571


7.1.2 CoxSy, SnxSy, CdS, NixSy and CuxSy photocatalysts. 
Zheng et al.572 prepared multilayer hierarchical nanostructured cobalt sulfide (CoS-2) composed of nanoplates via a facile solvothermal route. Owing to its structural features, the CoS-2 catalyst exhibited a substantial H2 production rate of 1196 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible light. The enhanced HER rate of CoS-2 was associated with its highly active sites due to its unique nanostructural features, and the synergistic impact among CoS and the mixture of cubic cattierite (CoS2) phase that leads to active electron transfer in catalytic process. Recently, by hydrothermal technique, SnS2 nanoplates were manufactured by Fu et al.573 with exposed (001) facets and a single-crystalline SnS2 over hexagon-shaped SnS2 nanoplates with a regular size of ∼275 nm and thickness of ∼56 nm. The ordered hexagon-SnS2 nanoplates attained a high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of ∼356 μmol h−1 under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm), which was greatly improved compared to irregular nanoplate-like SnS2. The enhanced performance was attributed to the highly crystalline nature with a smaller amount of defects in the regular hexagon SnS2 nanoplates compared to the irregular SnS2. In addition, the S atoms with more dense (001) exposed facets favoured the development of H bonds with H2O molecules, which can improve the activity. Typically, compared to hexagonal CdS, the cubic CdS photocatalyst displayed a lower H2 evolution performance under visible-light irradiation;574,575 since the hexagonal phase of CdS is stable and cubic CdS is a metastable phase. Hence, most CdS based photocatalysts for hydrogen generation are focused on hexagonal phased CdS, while the cubic CdS with an improved H2-evolution rate has rarely been studied. However, Yu et al.576 reported a high photocatalytic H2-evolution rate of ∼0.36 mmol h−1 for cubic phase CdS which was ∼2.6 times greater than the traditional hexagonal phase CdS i.e. ∼0.14 mmol h−1, as shown in Fig. 37. The resultant cubic CdS showed a small crystal size (∼5 nm) and large surface area (>75.23 m2 g−1) with a high stability and large number of active sites. Toe et al.577 prepared hollow copper sulfide (CuxS) from cuprous oxide (Cu2O) via an ion-exchange synthesis route. During photocatalytic hydrogen generation, the high activity was facilitated by its highly crystalline nature with low copper defects in CuxS; the catalyst also showed an excellent stability.

Similarly, nanostructures of NiS2 were controlled by a microwave-assisted method.338 NiS2 nanosized cubes, spheres and particles were obtained and were primarily used for photocatalytic hydrogen production. A variety of morphologies of NiS2 nanostructures are beneficial to enhance H2 production. Notably, NiS2 nanospheres showed highly enhanced photocatalytic for H2 evolution up to 3400 μmol throughout 12 h under visible light (λ > 420 nm) with an average H2 generation rate of 283 μmol h−1. Other metal sulfide photocatalytic nanomaterials such as ZrS2,578 Bi2S3,579 In2S3,580 and SnS581,582 also demonstrated good photocatalytic activity. Notably, most of the pristine or pure binary metal sulfides are defect rich and since some have poor light absorption, their physical, chemical and optical properties were modified accordingly. These materials are now discussed in detail in the following sections.

7.2 Bi-metal sulfides

7.2.1 MInxSy (M = Zn, Cd, Cu, Ca, Na) photocatalysts. 
Bi-metal ZnIn2S4 is a semiconductor chalcogenide photocatalyst that has an energy gap consistent to the absorption of visible-light with chemical stability. In addition, ZnIn2S4 is an eco-friendly photocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 generation and thus several morphologies such as nanoparticles, microspheres, nanoribbons and nanotubes have been fabricated and used for photocatalysis.583–588 However, during nanostructure growth, solvent effects are more influential. In this aspect, Shen et al.584 prepared three kinds of microstructures such as flowering-cherry-like microspheres and micro clusters using the solvents of water, methanol and ethylene glycol (EG). Notably, aqueous-mediated ZnIn2S4 exhibited a highly crystalline nature, which resulted in the highest photocatalytic activity of ∼27.3 μmol h−1, for hydrogen production rate under visible-light. Methanol and ethylene glycol mediated ZnIn2S4 exhibited a smaller H2 generation rate of ∼12.4 μmol h−1 and ∼9.1 μmol h−1, respectively.
A hexagonal ZnIn2S4 surface morphology was controlled using trimethylamine to create marigold flowers and nanoplates/nanostrips via a hydrothermal method. Due to the narrow band gap of ∼2.34–2.48 eV the hexagonal ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst was used for H2 production from hydrogen sulfide (H2S). H2S + OH− ↔ HS− + H2O(53) Semiconducting metal sulfide: ZnIn2S4 → h+VB + e−CB(54) Oxidation reaction: 2HS− + 2h+VB → S22− + 2H+(55) Reduction reaction: 2H+ + 2e−CB → H2(56)
These are the basic mechanisms for photocatalytic H2 generation via H2S photodecomposition. Initially, the semiconducting metal sulfide absorbs light and produces electron–hole pairs. Then, the photogenerated charge carriers diffuse into the electrolyte solution, driving the reaction of photodecomposition to yield hydrogen. Further, the valence band hole (h+VB) of ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst powder oxidizes the HS− ion to a disulfide (S22−) ion, releasing a proton from the HS− ion, where the electron of the conduction band electron (e−CB) of the photocatalyst reduces protons to create hydrogen molecules. A HER rate of ∼5287 μmol h−1 was achieved under visible light. The influence of indium concentration on structural morphology and photocatalytic HER activity was examined by Song et al. Of all the varied indium compositions studied, a high photocatalytic HER activity of 363 μmol g−1 h−1 was observed for the ZnIn2.3S4−y photocatalyst, which was credited to its large specific surface area and small crystallite size.589 In addition, Lei et al.256 examined the photocatalytic activity of ZnIn2S4 for H2 evolution. Significantly, the ZnIn2S4 exhibited a HER activity of ∼57 μmol g−1 h−1 and by using a Pt co-catalyst, it was improved to ∼800 μmol g−1 h−1. Microspheres of ZnIn2S4 fabricated by a template free hydrothermal technique exhibited a hydrogen production rate of ∼842 μmol h−1 at pH = 1.585 Likewise, a bio-inspired material of hydrilla templated hexagonal-cubic phase ZnIn2S4 was prepared by Chen et al.590 and an enhanced photocatalytic H2 production rate of ∼14.9 μmol h−1 was achieved. The enhancement in performance was attributed to effective charge separation and transfer through the hexagonal-cubic phase junction and photon energy harvesting nature of hydrilla leave structure. Later, Shen et al.591 prepared a ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst using a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) assisted hydrothermal method. Notably, the photocatalytic performance of CTAB assisted ZnIn2S4 was enhanced with a large band gap, compared to the ZnIn2S4 made without CTAB, and as the degree of CTAB increases, the d space (006) of ZnIn2S4 increases. The highest quantum yield for a ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst prepared by the 9.6 mol CTAB-assisted hydrothermal method was ∼18.4% at 420 nm with a hydrogen production rate of 112.45 mmol h−1 and 122.5 mmol h−1.592
A highly crystalline CdIn2S4 photocatalyst with a marigold-like morphology and a diameter of 25 nm was prepared by Kale et al.62 where the photocatalyst had quantum yields of ∼16.8% (CdIn2S4 marigold-like morphology) and 17.1% (CdIn2S4 nanotubes) at 500 nm light irradiation for photocatalytic HER. Similarly, a cubic spinel structured CdIn2S4 was prepared by Bhirud et al.593 who investigated the role of surfactant on its surface morphology and photocatalytic H2 generation activity. The marigold flower-like structure was attained without any surfactant. In addition, the surfactant PVP and CTAB was used to fabricate a bipyramid shape CdIn2S4 (length of 0.7–1 μm) and hollow cavity with marigold flower shaped CdIn2S4 respectively. The optical band gap was in the range of 2.12–2.29 eV. Compared to other photocatalysts, due to the structural feature and low band gap, the bipyramid shaped CdIn2S4 showed a good photocatalytic activity of ∼3238 mmol h−1 with good durability.
Ding et al.594 analyzed the photocatalytic HER activity of CaIn2S4, where optical studies indicated that CaIn2S4 had an optical band gap in the range of ∼1.68 to 1.74 eV with a hydrogen production rate of ∼30.92 μmol h−1 g−1. The authors proposed that CaIn2S4 confined In3+ ions in a d10 arrangement could be the reason for the high photocatalytic activity. In addition, Zhang et al.595 prepared a CuInS2 photocatalyst by an in situ template solvothermal method. The CuInS2 products showed complex hierarchical features, composed of interleaving 2D microcrystals and adjacent monodispersity. During synthesis, the CuS hierarchitectures were initially created, and later acted as self-sacrificed templates to produce the CuInS2 photocatalyst. Notably, a high HER rate of ∼59.4 μmol h−1 was attained and this enhanced performance may be due to the monodispersity, high surface area, visible light response and more active sites for photocatalysis reaction. Akihiko et al.596 prepared a spinel metal sulfide of NaInS2 that comprised of anion layers of InS2, and due to its low band gap of ∼2.3 eV the photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution was tested under visible light irradiation. The NaInS2 photocatalyst exhibited a photocatalytic activity ∼28 μmol h−1 even without a co-catalyst; however, this material may undergo photocorrosion.


7.2.2 M1−xCdxS (M = Zn, Mn) photocatalysts. 
Numerous investigations have claimed that the photocatalytic performance of metal sulfide catalysts can be significantly improved by using its bi-metal form.552,597–599 For example, Kaur et al.600 prepared various Zn1−xCdxS (x = 0.1–0.9) materials using a 4,4′-dipyridyldisulfide (DPDS = (C5H4N)2S2) sulfur source. The band gap shrinkage of Zn1−xCdxS was observed to be related to the Cd concentration. The Zn0.7Cd0.3S solid solution exhibited the highest H2 production rate of ∼750 μmol h−1 g−1; see Fig. 38(i). Zhao et al.601 prepared a cubic zinc blende Zn–Cd–S via a hydrothermal technique using L-cystine. Notably, without a co-catalyst, an improved photocatalytic H2 activity was achieved over Zn0.9Cd0.1S with a generation rate of ∼4.4 mmol h−1 g−1, which was higher than CdS. In addition, Zn0.9Cd0.1S exhibited excellent anti-photocorrosion during the photoreduction of H2O into H2. The improvement in performance was credited to the efficient charge transfer of large surface area and alloyed ternary structure. Using a ZIF-8, Chen et al.602 prepared hollow ZnCdS rhombic dodecahedral cages via sulfurization and cation-exchange method, see Fig. 38(ii). The prepared hollow cages of ZnCdS exhibited a mesoporous structure with improved visible-light utilization and separation of charge carriers and transfer compared to the ZnS cages, due to the provision of abundant exposed active sites for hydrogen generation. As a consequence, the hollow Zn0.6Cd0.4S cage catalyst demonstrated the maximum hydrogen generation rate of ∼5.68 mmol h−1 g−1 without any co-catalyst in visible-light conditions. Additionally, these ZnCdS hollow cages displayed long-term stability. Using a hydrothermal method, Ikeue et al.603 prepared Mn1−xCdxS with a high concentration of Mn content (x = 0.1), which was an efficient and stable photocatalyst with the addition of RuOx for H2 production from water under visible light irradiation. As a result, the Mn1−xCdxS showed an eight times higher activity than bare CdS. Moreover, the addition of Mn to the mono-metal sulfides including NiS, ZnS, FeS, CoS, CuS, Ag2S, BaS, and SnS revealed a higher performance than bare materials. These results clearly indicate that the bi-metal structure formation of mono-sulfides with optimum Mn concentration can enhance HER activity.

7.3 Other bi-metal sulfides
Compared to metal oxides, the metal sulfides have initiated as a new class of materials for energy conversion and storage applications due to their low-cost and high electrochemical and photocatalytic activity. They have demonstrated attractive properties such as exceptional redox reversibility, capacitance, optical properties and high conductivity. Recently, Takayama et al.604 prepared a series of sulvanite structured Cu3VS4, Cu3NbS4, and Cu3TaS4 photocatalysts by a solid-state reaction method. The sulvanite structured Cu3MS4 (M = V, Ta, and Nb) contained edge and corner assimilated MS4 and CuS4 tetrahedrals. Notably, the Cu3VS4 photocatalyst reacted to near-IR light, up to ∼800 nm. These results indicated that photocatalytic H2 evolution progressed by band gap excitation of the photocatalyst and all materials exhibited an excellent photocatalytic HER, as shown in Fig. 39. In addition, without any co-catalyst, Zn0.957Cu0.043S exhibited a high rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with a quantum yield of 3.7% under visible light in an aqueous Na2SO3 solution.605 Kale et al.606 prepared nanoprisms, nanohexagons, and nanowires of cadmium lanthanum sulfide (CdLa2S4) through a facile hydrothermal method and used them for HER activity. Due to the narrow band gap, the nanoprism shaped photocatalyst achieved a good optical response to visible light; with a high H2 production rate of ∼2552 μmol h−1.

7.4 Doped metal sulfide photocatalysts

7.4.1 Cation doping. 
For solar water splitting, many of the semiconducting metal sulfides are restricted by their lack of optical absorption over the entire solar spectrum. Some materials possess a wide band, and some have photocorrosion properties which limit long-term durability.607–610 To date, metal sulfide semiconductors have been widely used as active materials and combined with materials such as Au, Pd, Pt, and Ni271,611–617 for efficient charge separation and band gap reduction, which are beneficial for high photocatalytic activity. For instance, with plasmonic Au/Ag doping on monolayer MoS2, a localized phase transition was observed,618 and a plasmonic enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of ∼1.35 μmol h−1 was observed under 690 nm laser illumination (25 mW). Likewise, as shown in Fig. 40(i), Raza et al.619 prepared Pd doped 2H-WS2 nanosheets by a sonic wave-assisted nucleation method without any reductants. It was reported that, different sizes and densities of Pd NPs on 2H-WS2 nanosheets can control the photocatalytic performance of WS2/PdNPs. Notably, the increased size of Pd nanoparticles on WS2 enhanced the photocatalytic activity through Suzuki reactions.

Significantly, the doping of metal ions into a semiconducting oxide photocatalysts has been widely examined, but not for metal sulfide photocatalysts. A ZnS photocatalyst with a wide band gap (3.6 eV) has a high conduction band and displays high photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution without any co-catalysts such as Pt or Ru in the existence of a sacrificial reagent. However, an outstanding photocatalytic activity was observed after ZnS was doped with low-cost metal cations such as Cu, Ni, and Pb.620–623 Similarly, band gap shrinkage was observed for Ni doped ZnS photocatalysts.571 These metal cation-doped ZnS materials exhibited higher photocatalytic HER from aqueous solutions with electron donors of S2− and/or SO32−. Zhang et al.624 synthesized nanoparticles of Au decorated ZnS photocatalyst and after the decoration of 5 nm sized Au nanoparticles on the ZnS surface, the band gap was narrowed. The band gap reduction and surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) of Au nanoparticles enabled 4 wt% of Au loaded on ZnS to display the best HER rate of ∼3306 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible light irradiation. Kuang et al.625 stated that, owing to the SPR effect, Au QDs doped CdS nanospheres exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity for H2 generation of ∼601.2 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible light, as shown in Fig. 40(ii). The enhanced activity may also be attributed to the high adhesion of the rough surface of cadmium sulfide nanospheres and interface with Au QDs, which facilitates charge separation, confines the charge recombination, and accelerates the separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs.
The addition of a Pt co-catalyst can enhance the electroactive sites and facilitate a high H2 evolution rate. Shang et al.597 prepared microspheres of ZnIn2S2via a polyol-mediated hot injection method and by the use of co-catalyst of Pt (1 wt% loading), the ZnIn2S4 exhibited a photocatalytic H2 production rate of ∼612 mmol h−1 g−1 which was approximately four times greater than pristine ZnIn2S4 photocatalysts (∼151.8 μmol h−1 g−1). Chai et al.585 reported that Pt loaded ZnIn2S2 prepared using a template-free approach enhanced the photocatalytic activity due to increased active sites and large surface area. Depending on the cation and their combination with the ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst, the photocatalytic performance was greatly enhanced. For instance, the combination of cubic quantum dot and hexagonal microsphere ZnIn2S4 exhibited a photocatalytic HER rate of ∼114.2 μmol h−1.284 A ZnIn2S4 with different compositions of Cu (0 wt% to 2 wt%) as a dopant was introduced by Shen et al.626 At the optimum concentration, the energy band positions and optical properties of 0.5 wt% of Cu doped ZnIn2S4 showed the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution of ∼151.5 μmol h−1 under visible light. Likewise, Jing et al.627 prepared Ni2+ doped ZnIn2S4 microsphere structures with flower-like nanopetals. The optimum composition of a 0.3 wt% Ni doped ZnIn2S4 exhibited a high HER rate. However, it was observed that the use of a higher Ni2+ doping level could not lead to doping into the ZnIn2S4 host lattice and simply attached at ZnIn2S4 surface, leading to a reduced photoactivity. It was thought that Ni2+ entering the ZnIn2S4 host lattice, instead of the surface, had the strongest impact on photocatalytic activity. Tian et al.628 doped rare earth dopants such as La3+, Ce3+, Gd3+, Er3+, and Y3+ with a ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst. As a consequence, the 2.0 wt% rare earth ions of Y, Gd, Er, Ce, and La doping exhibited improved HER efficiency in terms of ∼46%, ∼53%, ∼61%, ∼69%, and ∼106%, respectively. This enhanced performance was accredited to the increased surface area and total pore volume, and the doping introduced rich defects to ZnIn2S4. Similarly, Shen et al.629 prepared a series of Ca, Sr and Ba doped ZnIn2S4 materials by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. The Ca-doped ZnIn2S4 displayed a superior photocatalytic performance of ∼550 μmol h−1 g−1, which was higher than pure and other metals doped ZnIn2S4 due to a suppressed charge carrier recombination via band-to-band transition in dopant of Ca in ZnIn2S4. Later, the same group630 doped Cr, Mn, Fe and Co into the host lattices of ZnIn2S4 to reduce the energy gap. Due to their narrow band gap, the Mn-doped ZnIn2S4 revealed enhanced photocatalytic activity. Conversely, the lowered activity of Cr, Fe, and Co doped ZnIn2S4 was accredited to the dopant-related impurity energy levels or they may act as centers of non-radiative recombination for photoexcited charge carriers of electrons and holes. Recently, Bai et al.631 prepared Ce3+-doped nanosheets of Zn0.8Cd0.2S–ethylenediamine (En) by solvothermal technique. The role of Ce3+ doping concentration on the photocatalytic H2 evolution was observed under visible light irradiation. As a result, the doping of Ce3+ in the form of uniformly distributed Ce2S3 on Zn0.8Cd0.2S–En hybrid nanosheets revealed a narrow band gap. Moreover, under the visible light irradiation, a maximum H2 production rate of ∼229.2 μmol h−1 was measured for 0.1 wt% Ce3+-doped Zn0.8Cd0.2S–En nanosheets, which was about ∼1.4 times higher than the pristine material. Similarly, Cu and Ni doped Cd05Zn0.5S nanoplates were fabricated by Hao et al.632 and due to the synergetic effect between Co, Ni and Cd05Zn0.5S nanoplates, the maximum H2 evolution rate of ∼58.33 mmol h−1 g−1 was attained, which was ∼3.5 times higher than pure Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanoplates. Ding et al.633 developed a bi-metallic Au–Pt with CaIn2S4, and due to the SPR effect this photocatalyst showed a greater photocatalytic hydrogen generation activity of ∼107.6 μmol h−1 g−1, which was ∼18.3, 2.37 and 2.4 times higher than pure CaIn2S4, Au–CaIn2S4, and Pt–CaIn2S4 photocatalysts. This enhanced H2 production could be ascribed to the low recombination of the photogenerated charges and surface plasmon resonance effect of Au nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 41(i).

7.4.2 Anion doping. 
It is recognized that the Fermi level of metal sulfides is elevated to the level of S vacancies after P doping, which enables the S vacancies to become improved electron trap centers.634 This is considered to extend the lifetime of photogenerated electrons. Recently, without any electron sacrificial agents, a phosphorus (P)-doped CdS with rich S vacancies (CdS-P) was shown to act as an effective photocatalytic material for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation.634 The pristine CdS did not show any dominant activity, while CdS-P had a moderate H2 production rate of ∼76 μmol h g−1. The photogenerated charge carriers in CdS-P with a long lifetime due to suppressed electron–hole pair recombination for surface active sites for the photocatalytic redox reaction see Fig. 41(ii). Moreover, when a small amount of co-catalyst of CoP was loaded onto the CdS-P photocatalysts, the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction rate was enhanced significantly, particularly for 5 wt% of CoP on CdS-P exhibited a maximum HER rate of ∼231 μmol h g−1. This enhancement was associated with the separation of facile charge carrier between CdS-P and CoP. Moreover, sulfur vacancies can promote the energy conversion process. In this aspect, Ye et al.635 prepared P doped ZnxCd1−xS with rich S vacancies (ZnxCd1−xS-P). It was found that interstitial doping of P on ZnxCd1−xS with sulfur vacancies could extend the life time of charge carriers and increase the separation and generation of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus resulting in a maximum H2 production rate of ∼419 μmol h−1 g−1, which was ∼72 and 7.5 times greater than those of ZnS-P (∼5.8 μmol h−1 g−1) and CdS-P (∼56 μmol h−1 g−1) photocatalysts, respectively.

7.5 Heterostructured metal sulfides
Evolving high-quality nanocrystals of metal sulfide photocatalysts with precisely controlled optical and chemical properties is of interest for fundamental studies and practical energy conversion applications.271,611,636,637 Despite the excellent chemical stabilities, some of the metal sulfides could exhibit poor optical properties for renewable energy conversion applications. Typically, the optical properties of metal sulfides are determined by the intrinsic band gap energy. The ability to fine-tune the band gap is worthwhile for emerging metal sulfides with novel optical properties and photocatalytic applications. In this regard, recent studies are focusing on heterostructures and/or hybrid structures.271 Mostly, the heterostructures or hybrids of semiconducting materials are formed through the use of one or more semiconducting compounds on the host material, where the size confines the activities of the charge carriers for quantum confinement. This leads to the development of a set of discrete energy levels at which the charge carriers can exist.638–646 Examples of such heterostructures are now discussed.

7.5.1 MoS2 based heterostructures. 
The bulk nature and reduced inter-domain electron transport of MoS2 makes it important for photocatalytic oxidation/reduction reactions. Thus, effort has been devoted to improving the conductivity of MoS2. In order to activate the material to achieve a photocatalytic response it is essential to modify the optical properties of MoS2 through heterostructure formation.647–652 Compared to the commonly used precious metal co-catalysts (such as Pt, Pd and Au), layered transition metal sulfides such as MoS2 and WS2 show p-type active species, which are favorable for the creation of p–n-junction heterostructured photocatalysts with CdS (n-type) semiconductor for the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes, leading to efficient photocatalytic hydrogen generation.653,654 Recently, Liu et al.655 prepared unique hollow microbox structured CdS/MoS2 heterostructures using a hydrothermal method. Under visible-light, the CdS/MoS2 microboxes exhibited a higher photocatalytic H2 production rate of ∼1.36 mmol h−1 g−1 compared to pristine microboxes of CdS (∼0.04 mmol h−1 g−1). In addition, at 420 nm an apparent quantum yield of ∼14.5% was attained, as shown in Fig. 42(i). Their investigation revealed that MoS2 nanosheets can act as an electron acceptor and co-catalyst for the enrichment of electron transfer and photogenerated charge carrier separation from CdS to further encourage the surface H2 generation kinetics. In addition, the hierarchical CdS/MoS2 microboxes provide additional features such as distinct interior voids, low density and shell porosity to enhance the photocatalytic activity. Yang et al.656 used nanowires of unstable CdS as a core and multilayered MoS2 as a shell to form a CdS@MoS2 core–shell structures. The MoS2 not only acts as a shielding shell to preserve the CdS but also offers reactive sites and builds a type I junction, thereby increasing HER activity and long-term durability. As a result, an optimum H2 production rate of ∼26.14 mmol h−1 g−1 was attained, which was ∼54 times and ∼2 times higher than pristine CdS and 1 wt% Pt/CdS, respectively. Similarly, using a hydrothermal method, CdS–Au/MoS2 hierarchical core/shell heterostructures were prepared,657 see Fig. 42(ii). The addition of Au nanoparticles on CdS nanorods led to the creation of a Schottky junction and a strong SPR effect. Moreover, the few layered MoS2 nanosheets acted as a hierarchical protecting shell around the CdS nanorods, to reduce photocorrosion. A CdS–Au/MoS2 retains a large number of edge sites in the MoS2 layers which are energetic active sites for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and the heterostructure displayed outstanding photocatalytic H2 evolution which was seven times higher than pristine CdS nanorods. Zong et al.658 confirmed that the activity of MoS2 can be increased by mixing with CdS. The MoS2/CdS material displayed a greater rate of HER than Pt/CdS. It was proposed that structural combination among CdS and MoS2 due to S2− anions of each substances resulted in improved photocatalytic activity. As a result, the H2 evolution rate of CdS was increased by ∼36 times after loading of ∼0.2 wt% of MoS2, and the photocatalytic activity of MoS2/CdS was greater than the CdS photocatalysts loaded with noble metals, such as Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Au. Tang et al.659 investigated a microwave-deposited MoS3 on CdSe-seeded CdS nanorod photoabsorbers. They indicated that MoS3 was as active as Pt for HER, but the photoactivity decreased as MoS3 was condensed to MoS2 over time.

Reproduced from ref. 660 with permission from Wiley-VCH, copyright 2018. 
The formation of Ag2S@MoS2 core–shell nanowires via the addition of different amounts of MoS2 with Ag2S was proposed by Bai et al.660 It was observed that the maximum photocatalytic activity was achieved by an optimum MoS2 loading level. Notably, a lower amount of MoS2 not only decreased the interfacial contact for inadequate electron–hole separation but also reduced the amount of catalytic active sites for photocatalytic H2 production; whereas a higher amount of MoS2 preserved the light-protecting effect of Ag2S and increased the distance of electron transfer to the catalytic active sites for H2 production, thereby decreasing performance. As a result, as shown in Fig. 42(iii), Ag2S@MoS2 NWs with a moderate amount of MoS2 (50 wt%) loading displayed the maximum H2 production rate of ∼141.6 mmol h−1 g−1. Recently, it was observed that Ni3S2/MoS2 nanostructures favor a wide range of optical absorption from 300 to 800 nm.661 As a consequence, the heterostructure of Ni3S2/MoS2 revealed a remarkable rate of H2 evolution (∼540.75 μmol g−1 h−1), which was ∼5.7 and ∼3.9 times higher than pristine Ni3S2 and MoS2, respectively. Similarly, Ta3N5 nanosheets and MoS2 (5.2 wt%) based MoS2/Ta3N5 heterostructures exhibited a H2 generation rate of 119.4 μmol h−1 g−1, which was higher than Pt/Ta3N5 nanosheets.662 In addition, WS2, MoS2, and SnS loaded onto TiO2 and CdS have also been examined for H2 evolution, where TiO2 and CdS both act as catalysts and light absorbers.663–666 The combination of metal sulfides with TiO2 based semiconductor photocatalysts is effective since TiO2 bears significant absorption of wavelength shorter than ∼400 nm, while the optical absorption of metal sulfides can be adjusted by the number of layers and by the optimum composition ratio to expand absorption of visible and near infra-red (NIR) wavelengths. For instance, MoS2 nanosheets on TiO2 nanobelts exhibited enriched visible light absorption compared to bare TiO2 nanobelts.667 Finally, TiO2 nanobelts displayed a high H2 evolution rate of ∼1.6 mmol h−1 g−1 when combined with 50 wt% of MoS2. It is thought that the similar energy levels of MoS2 and TiO2 allows facile charge transfer and prevents charge carrier recombination. Thus, considerable effort has been dedicated to improving the performance of MoS2 by heterostructure establishment and these include CdSe/MoS2,668 MoS2/AlN(GaN)669 and WS2–MoS2–CdS.654 These materials exhibited an enhanced H2 production rate, facile charge transport properties and long-term durability. Using the hydrothermal method, Ma et al.670 prepared monolayers of 3 nm sized MoS2 quantum dot confined polyimide (MQDs/PI) photocatalyst and a strong quantum confinement was observed for this photocatalyst in terms of a blue shift in the absorption band edge. Owing to the enhancement in interfacial electronic interaction between MoS2 quantum dot (MQDs) and PI revealed a high charge transfer rate of MQDs/PI. As a consequence, the MQDs/PI with a large number of active sites exhibited a ∼360% enhancement in H2 production compared to high cost Pt/PI.


7.5.2 WS2 based heterostructures. 
Increasing the activities of metal sulfide photocatalysts is a challenge in H2 generation. Hence the optimum concentration of materials are essential to form the most appropriate heterostructures; in this aspect a mass ratio of 1.6:1 was used to fabricate the WS2–CdS heterostructure by He et al.671 As a result, CdS nanorods with thin WS2 nanosheets attached were obtained. Due to the improved photogenerated charge carrier separation as a result of heterojunction formation, this heterostructure exhibited an excellent H2 generation rate of ∼1222 μmol h−1 g−1 for 20 mg catalyst under visible light. Similarly, the concentration effect of WS2 on CdS was investigated by Zong et al.672 using an impregnation–sulfidation method, whereas, the CdS/WS2 heterostructure junction formation was identified by XPS analysis. Under an optimal amount of WS2 (i.e. 1 wt%) with CdS, the rate of photocatalytic activity was increased by ∼28 times compared to pristine CdS. In addition, combining three compounds to form a strong heterojunction is of interest. As an example, Reddy et al.654 prepared a stable noble-metal-free photocatalyst of CdS/WS2–MoS2. Under visible light irradiation, the resultant CdS/WS2–MoS2 catalyst achieved high photocatalytic performance with a H2 production rate of ∼209.79 mmol g−1 h−1, which was higher than the values of other bi-junction heterostructures such as CdS/MoS2 (∼123.31 mmol h−1 g−1), CdS/WS2 (∼169.82 mmol h−1 g−1) and the CdS/Pt catalyst (∼34.98 mmol h−1 g−1). The optimized CdS/WS2–MoS2 catalyst provided an apparent quantum yield of ∼51.4% at λ = 425 nm irradiation. Their investigations showed that the heterostructured ultrathin nanosheets of WS2–MoS2 are an excellent co-catalyst to increase the solar-driven photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate by supporting photoinduced charge carrier transfer and controlling recombination of electron–hole pair and consequent reduction of protons to produce H2. Mahler et al.436 used the direct production of 2H and the 1T monolayers of colloidal WS2 by exfoliation. As a result, 1T-WS2 with TiO2 exhibited a higher rate of H2 production (2570 μmol h−1 g−1) than 2H-WS2.


7.5.3 CdS based heterostructures. 
Photocatalytic activity is a surface phenomenon, and materials with similar chemical compositions, but different exposed facets, can display a distinct performance due to their different electronic structures and atomic arrangements. The active exposure of catalytic planes can increase the catalytic activity. Notably, the metal disulfides of MoS2 or WS2 nanosheets with thickness from 4 to 10 nm on (0001) surface of wurtzite CdS nanocrystals were prepared by Chen et al.673 Both catalysts of WS2/CdS and MoS2/CdS showed increased edge sites, which led to the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of ∼1984 and ∼1472 μmol h−1 g−1 respectively, which was ∼16 and 12 times higher than bare CdS (119 μmol h−1 g−1).
Significantly, in most studies to date the incorporation of a co-catalyst on the photocatalyst surface has been shown to have a significant role on catalytic activity, since the co-catalyst can afford excellent electron transfer rate, facile photogenerated charge carrier separation and high adsorption to visible light features to further encourage the surface H2 generation kinetics. Hence, the preparation of photocatalyst heterojunctions using amorphous cobalt phosphide (CoPx) with cadmium sulfide nanorods (CdS NRs) has attracted interest,674 which led to an exceptionally high photocatalytic H2 production rate under visible light with ∼500 μmol h−1 mg−1 and an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of ∼35% at λ = 450 nm. In addition, without any sacrificial agents, a Ni2P@CdS catalyst can promote charge separation and recombination of photogenerated carriers to achieve a high photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation.675 A heterostructured photocatalyst of nickel phosphide with CdS (10Ni2P@CdS) exhibited an excellent hydrogen evolution activity of ∼251.4 μmol of H2 in 180 min with a high AQY of ∼3.89% at 430 nm. In addition, the photocatalytic activity and stability of 10Ni2P@CdS was higher than a heterostructured photocatalyst of Pt with CdS (1Pt@CdS).
Recently, in order to prepare nickel sulfide that covered CdS heterostructures, Qin et al.676 reported a one-step hydrothermal approach to fabricate a catalyst of NiSx/CdS with enhanced activity for visible light-driven HER; this was due to the dispersion of distinct nanoparticles and close contact between the two materials. As shown in Fig. 43, a novel heterostructure consisting of β-NiS film with CdS nanoflowers (NiS/CdS NFs) was prepared by Zhang et al.677 The manufactured NiS/CdS NFs had a well-formed and integrated structure with robust surface adhesion between the nanoflowers of semiconducting CdS and the co-catalyst NiS thin film, to provide a high photogenerated electron transfer rate and high adsorption to visible light features. Subsequently, the heterostructure had an efficient photocatalytic H2 production rate of 30.1 mmol h−1 g−1, and improved structural and chemical stability in 20 vol% lactic acid/aqueous solution under visible light, which was greater than other CdS–NiS composite catalysts. Later, it was observed that a maximum AQY of ∼93% was achievable for a Pt–PbS/CdS photocatalysts based H2 generation system in the presence of sacrificial reagents under visible-light.614 This higher activity was achieved with a loading level as low as 0.30 wt% of Pt and 0.13 wt% of PdS as a co-catalyst on CdS. In addition, the photocatalytic H2 production by CdS, Pt/CdS, Pd/CdS, Pt–Pd/CdS catalysts were also studied. The bare CdS exhibited a low activity for H2 production (∼0.023 mmol h−1), and the photoactivity was improved by loading precious metals such as Pd and Pt as co-catalysts, while the performance was amplified after Pt and Pd were co-loaded. When PdS was used as a co-catalyst, the photocatalytic performance was even greater than Pt/CdS, reaching an activity ∼280 times higher than bare CdS. In addition, the photocatalytic activity was enhanced by ∼380 times when Pt/PdS were co-loaded on the CdS catalyst, and the photocatalytic H2 generation reached ∼8.77 mmol h−1.

Similarly, due to its heterostructure nature, an optimized NiCo2S4/CdS composite exhibited a high H2 production rate of ∼137 μmol h−1 when illuminated by visible light, which was ∼17 times higher than the pristine CdS material.678 In addition, Wang et al.679 prepared a CdS/NiTiO3/CoS heterojunction to increase visible light H2 production using a semiconducting CdS. Due to the wide spectrum response of the CdS/NiTiO3/CoS nanocomposite, the development of a CdS/NiTiO3 heterojunction, and the decoration of CoS as a co-catalyst, a superior photocatalytic performance was achieved compared to bare samples. As a result, a maximum HER activity of ∼2381 μmol was attained under visible to NIR irradiation, which was ∼22 times higher than the bare CdS. Furthermore, photo-corrosion was inhibited for this CdS/NiTiO3/CoS heterostructure.
Hou et al.680 prepared 20 nm sized CdS decorated CdLa2S4 microspheres (CdS/CdLa2S4) by a two-step hydrothermal process where highly crystalline CdS with a hexagonal structure was attained in the CdS/CdLa2S4. The structural features resulted in an intimate multi-point contact between the CdS and CdLa2S4, which delivered an improvement in charge separation of the CdS/CdLa2S4 heterostructure. A CdLa2S4 with 3 wt% CdS including 0.4 wt% of Pt provided a H2 generation rate of ∼2.25 mmol h−1 with an AQY of ∼54% under illumination by 420 nm light. This rate of HER was ∼9 times higher than that for CdLa2S4, which was thought to be due to the existence of 20 nm sized CdS nanocrystals that can modify the energy levels of the conduction and valence bands in the combined semiconductor system. Zou et al.681 prepared CdS/Sr2(Nb17/18Zn1/18)2O1−δ heterostructured composites by varying the CdS content, among them 30% CdS/Sr2(Nb17/18Zn1/18)2O1−δ (30CSNZO) exhibited the highest H2 production activity of ∼1669.1 μmol h−1 g−1, which was higher than the pristine material.

7.6 Other heterostructured metal sulfides
To date, several metal sulfides have been used to create heterostructures.682–685 However an ideal practical catalyst for H2 production is yet to emerge. Thus, it is essential to develop Earth abundant, environmental-friendly, cost-effective and highly efficient noble-metal-free H2 evolution photocatalysts with the aim of delivering cost-competitive hydrogen fuel. In this regard, Qin et al.686 observed that the formation of a heterojunction using a NiS2 co-catalyst resulted in a remarkable improvement in photocatalytic H2 production compared to a bare semiconducting photocatalyst under visible light. The NiS/Ni3S4 catalyst was fabricated via a hydrothermal method. As a result, the NiS/Ni3S4 retained the maximum adsorbed protons, which led to enhanced photocatalytic properties and the catalyst exhibited an AQY of ∼56.5% at 420 nm, demonstrating the intrinsic property for well-organized H2 generation. Similarly, owing to the enhanced photogenerated electron and hole separation and the activation effect of NiS2 on CdLa2S4, the optimized 2 wt% NiS2/CdLa2S4 exhibited a high H2 evolution rate of ∼2.5 mmol h−1 g−1, which was ∼3 times higher than a bare CdLa2S4 photocatalyst.687
A chalcopyrite-type structured copper gallium sulfide (CuGa3S5) with a band gap of ∼2.4 eV was fabricated by Tabata et al.688 A 5.0 wt% NiS/CuGa3S5 catalyst was also prepared by modification of the bare sample. Even without a co-catalyst, under visible light irradiation the 5.0 wt% NiS/CuGa3S5 exhibited an improved photocatalytic activity which was ∼3 times higher than Rh/CuGa3S5. Their examination of electrochemical and photocatalytic reactions suggested that the NiS dispersed in the reactant solution received electrons from the excited state of the host CuGa3S5 catalyst to reduce H2O into H2, whereas NiS and CuGa3S5 nanoparticles collided with each other in the reactant aqueous solution. Moreover, co-catalysts of CuS689 and NiS690 were introduced to modify the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, and demonstrated an improvement. A cobalt sulfide quantum dot (CoSx QD) modified TiO2 photocatalyst was prepared by Yu et al.691via a precipitation technique. Quantum dots of CoSx can act as an active co-catalyst, which improves photo-generated electron transport and also act as active catalytic sites for water splitting reaction, thereby increasing the photocatalytic H2 generation activity of TiO2 by the apparent separation of the e−/h+ pairs. As a consequence, a 5% CoSx with TiO2 exhibited a H2 production rate of ∼838 μmol h−1 g−1 in the presence of sacrificial reagent (ethanol), which was ∼35 times higher than bare TiO2.
Heterostructures of hollow materials with a well-organized light harvesting component with tunable interior constituents offer benefits for constructing an efficient energy conversion system. In this aspect, using hollow Co(OH)2 as a template, hollow Co9S8 cubes with CdS quantum dots (QDs) was prepared by Qiu et al.692 By utilizing multiple light reflections as it entered the cubic structure, the hollow CdS/Co9S8 cubes exhibited superior photocatalytic activity with a HER rate over ∼134 and 9.1 times higher than pristine hollow Co9S8 and CdS QDs respectively, see Fig. 44. This structure also offers complete light-harvesting and charge separation.

Recently, the conversion of H2S to useable hydrogen has become an active research area. Using a one step solvothermal method, a highly active In2S3/CuS heterostructure showed a remarkable visible light absorption with an edge of absorption at ∼785 nm, which is beneficial to harvest the complete light spectrum.693 As a consequence, the In2S3/CuS composite exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity under visible light and long-term durability for the reduction of H2S in terms of maximum H2 production rate of ∼14950 μmol g−1 h−1 without any precious metal co-catalysts, which was ∼404 and ∼87 times larger than bare Cu9S5 and β-In2S3 respectively. In addition, the In2S3/CuS heterostructure had an AQY of ∼9.3% at 420 nm. This excellent activity was influenced by the chemical structure, crystalline phase, optical nature and nanosheet-like structure of the In2S3/CuS heterostructure, which improved electron transfer between the interfaces of β-In2S3 and CuS, and enhanced the photogenerated electron–hole pair separation. Similarly, a Pt-loaded ZnS–CuInS2–AgInS2 photocatalyst provided photocatalytic activity for H2 in the presence of SO32− and S2− sacrificial reagents under irradiation of visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm).694 Notably, the energy band structure could be controlled by a change in composition. Hence, the ZnS–CuInS2–AgInS2 photocatalyst displayed absorption bands that were longer in wavelength than ZnS–CuInS2 and ZnS–AgInS2 solid solutions, which is possibly due to interactions between the Cu 3d and Ag 4d orbitals. Moreover, the Ru-loaded Cu0.25Ag0.25In0.5ZnS2 heterostructure, with the small band gap of ∼1.77 eV, generated H2 gas at a rate of ∼7.9 m−2 h−1. Similarly, due to its high optical absorption due to its heterostructure nature, CuS/TiO2 revealed a maximum photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of ∼1262 μmol h−1 g−1, which was ∼9.7 and 9.3 times higher than the bare TiO2 nanospindles and CuS nanoflakes under visible light.695 In addition, the core–shell CuInS2/ZnS QDs had a H2 production rate higher than bare CuInS2 and ZnS QDs.696
Similarly, Kang et al.697 attained a maximum H2 generation rate of ∼559 μmol g−1 h−1 for a solvothermally manufactured ZnS(en)0.5–CdS using 80 wt% of CdS. In addition, due to the efficient charge transfer response, the PdS-loaded ZnS(en)0.5–CdS displayed a good H2 production rate of ∼2600 μmol h−1 g−1, which was greater than PdS-loaded CdS and Cd0.6Zn0.4S catalysts.698 Du et al.699 attained a high performance of H2 generation using a metallic 1T-LixMoS2/Cd0.5Zn0.5S photocatalyst. The obtained heterostructure demonstrated excellent photocatalytic H2 generation from aqueous solution containing Na2S and Na2SO3 under visible light. During fabrication, the insertion of Li+ ions led to the transition of bulk MoS2 from a semiconductor trigonal 2H phase to a metallic 1T phase. The discrete work functionalities of 1T-LixMoS2 promoted the separation of photoexcited charge carriers when used as a co-catalyst with Cd0.5Zn0.5S. As a result, (1.0 wt%) 1T-LixMoS2/Cd0.5Zn0.5S junctions displayed a high HER rate of ∼769.9 μmol h−1, which was ∼3.5 and ∼2 times higher than bare Cd0.5Zn0.5S and (1.0 wt%) 2H-MoS2/Cd0.5Zn0.5S catalysts, respectively. Their outcomes demonstrated that Li+-intercalated MoS2 nanosheets provide high conductivity and exposed active sites to enhance performance. Nguyen700 reported a scalable fabrication method for MoS2/ZnxCd1−xS photocatalysts at various concentrations for H2 production. The best catalyst of Zn0.2Cd0.8S/MoS2 3% exhibited ∼210 times higher H2 production rate in visible light compared to bare Zn0.2Cd0.8S; this was a remarkable photocatalytic improvement in a heterojunction system.
By loading Pt with a wide band ZnS and narrow band gap CuInS2, Tsuji et al.701 prepared a photocatalyst of (CuIn)xZn2(1−x)S2 with a band gap of 2.3 eV. Due to its optimum band gap, this photocatalyst exhibited the highest H2 evolution activity of ∼1.5 L h−1 m−2 and the AQY was ∼12.5% at 420 nm. Their DFT models indicated that the visible-light response may result from the influence of Cu 3d and S 3p orbitals on the valence band and that of orbitals of In 5s5p and Zn 4s4p to the conduction band, respectively. The role of these orbitals to the energy bands exaggerated the photocatalytic and photophysical properties. By similar strategies, several research groups have achieved a high performance by forming heterojunctions of metal sulfides. For instance, Li et al.702 prepared ZnS-coated ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst, which exposed photocatalytic HER in the existence of glucose, and a production rate of ∼25 μmol h−1 g−1 was observed at a pH = 12. By using a two-step process, Wei et al.703 produced ZnIn2S4/NiS and used it as a photocatalyst. Their investigations indicated that NiS acts as an energetic co-catalyst, which aids in directional passage of photo-excited carriers, and provides catalytic active sites for H2 evolution. Interestingly, a heterojunction between NiS and ZnIn2S4 achieved a H2 rate of ∼104.7 μmol h−1, which was ∼1.35 times higher than Pt/ZnIn2S4 (∼77.8 μmol h−1). Mei et al.704 manufactured In2S3/ZnIn2S4 through an ion exchange method and the photocatalytic performance was higher than the bare samples. In addition, Ni(OH)2 was prepared as a co-catalyst with microspheres of ZnIn2S4 which exhibited a reasonable photocatalytic H2 evolution of ∼8.35 mmol g−1 h−1, which was ∼18 times larger than pristine ZnIn2S4. The assistance of Ni(OH)2 improved interfacial charge transfer and suppressed the electron–hole pair recombination.705
7.7 Graphene and/or carbon based metal sulfide photocatalysts
Graphene and/or carbon based metal sulfide photocatalysts with heterostructured compounds have attracted attention in photocatalytic H2 evolution research. A recent investigation by Bernardi et al.706 observed that 2D materials can absorb larger amounts of visible light compared to conventional photovoltaic semiconductors such as silicon or GaAs. Meng et al.616 reported high photocatalytic activity for a MoS2/rGO composite in which MoS2 was the light-harvesting material. In contrast, the MoS2/rGO composite had an enhanced H2 evolution rate of 7.4 μmol h−1 g−1, which was further increased to 24.8 μmol h−1 g−1 when the composite of rGO was doped with nitrogen. In addition, a VS4/rGO nanocomposite was synthesized by Guo et al.707 using 5 wt% rGO. During photocatalytic testing, a maximum H2 production rate of ∼0.7 mmol L−1 was observed. Ye et al.708 prepared a sheet-on-sheet morphology of rGO/ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites via a solvothermal method. The rGO reduction during composite formation enhanced the conductive nature of the composites, notably, 1.0 wt% rGO/ZnIn2S4 nanocomposite revealed an enhanced photoactivity of ∼245.1 μmol in 6 h, which was ∼4.3 times higher than the bare ZnIn2S4. This enhanced activity was attributed to the band gap of ZnIn2S4 and the more electrocatalytic active sites, good electron acceptor and mediator as well as the co-catalyst properties of the rGO.
The impact of 0D carbon quantum dots, 1D carbon nanotubes, and 2D reduced graphene oxide with ZnIn2S4 and their use for the H2 evolution reaction was analyzed by Xia et al.709 Compared to the other catalysts, rGO/ZnIn2S4 had a higher photocatalytic H2 production rate of ∼2640.8 mmol g−1 h−1. The enhanced activity of rGO/ZnIn2S4 was accredited to a high surface area provided by graphene which offered more active sites and larger area for transfer of charge-carriers. Mahadadalkar et al.710 prepared graphene with a CdIn2S4 composite, which exhibited improved photocatalytic performance of ∼4495 μmol h−1. The existence of rGO in the metal sulfide structures improved effective hole–electron separation and conductivity, which leads to reduced charge combination in the composite system. Similarly, Zhou et al.711 prepared ZnIn2S4/rGO nanosheets through a precise solvothermal method and due to the presence of rGO, the surface area of ZnIn2S4/rGO (∼92 m2 g−1) was doubled compared to the bare ZnIn2S4. As a result, 0.05 g of ZnIn2S4/rGO exhibited a maximum H2 generation rate of ∼81.6 mmol h−1 which was reduced to ∼40.3 mmol h−1 for 0.1 g of ZnIn2S4/rGO catalyst. Similarly, microspheres of a flower-like rGO/ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst were prepared using a microwave-assisted method,712 which provided a high photocatalytic H2 production rate of ∼132.3 μmol h−1, which was higher than 1.0 wt%-Pt/ZnIn2S4. Kale et al.713 achieved a photocatalytic H2 production rate of ∼6365 μmol h−1 with 0.2 g of catalyst of 3D ZnIn2S4/rGO heterostructure. As shown in Fig. 45(i), Zhang et al.714 obtained a HER rate of ∼1824 μmol h−1 g−1 with the AQY of ∼23.4% at 420 nm, in which the rGO content was ∼0.25 wt% in rGO–Zn0.8Cd0.2S photocatalyst.

Jia et al.617 prepared a series of nitrogen-doped graphene (N-graphene)/CdS nanocomposites by varying the N-graphene ratio. The optimum quantity of N-graphene was ∼2 wt%, at which the N-graphene/CdS catalyst reached the highest H2 generation of ∼210 μmol h−1, while ∼99 μmol h−1 for graphene/CdS and ∼95 μmol h−1 for GO/CdS was observed. Chai et al.715 fabricated a MWCNT/ZnIn2S4 by a hydrothermal method. Notably, 3 wt% of MWCNT on ZnIn2S4 had an improved H2 production rate of ∼684 mmol h−1. The addition of the optimal amount of MWCNT increased the charge transfer and provided higher charge separation efficiency, which was higher than materials with a lower and higher amount of 3 wt% of MWCNT. By a similar strategy, Xia et al.716 attempted to enhance the photocatalytic properties by employing CNT as a hybrid material with CaIn2S4. Benefitting from the stability and conductive nature of CNT, the composite material showed an improved crystalline nature and large surface area so that the CaIn2S4 exhibited a photocatalytic H2 generation rate of ∼23.4 μmol h−1 g−1.
Pramoda et al.511 prepared a C3N4–MoS2 nanocomposite via a solution technique, where C3N4 was covalently bonded to MoS2 or N-rGO nanosheets. Due to these chemical features, the high photocatalytic HER activity of ∼12778 μmol h−1 g−1 and a turnover frequency of 2.35 h−1 were attained for the C3N4–MoS2 nanocomposite. This enhanced performance was attributed to the effective charge-transfer between the components as well as larger numbers of cross-linked layers. To date, a polymeric photocatalyst based on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), has received attention because of its good chemical and thermal stability, and response to visible-light. By using the sacrificial reagents during photocatalytic H2 production, the CdS/g-C3N4 core/shell nanowires exhibited a high rate of ∼4152 μmol h−1 g−1, where the composite had 2 wt% of g-C3N4.717 The synergic effect between CdS and g-C3N4, which can efficiently facilitate charge separation and transfer the corrosive holes from CdS to durable C3N4, was thought to be responsible for improving photocatalytic performance and photostability. Jiang et al.718 achieved ∼102 μmol g−1 h−1 for CaIn2S4/g-C3N4 under visible light, which was ∼3 times higher than the bare CaIn2S4, see Fig. 45(ii). The improved photocatalytic activity of the CaIn2S4/g-C3N4 heterojunction was due to improved charge separation efficiency.
However, there remains a challenge to improve both the number of active sites and charge separation of metal sulfide semiconductors to create highly efficient and long-term durable photocatalytic HER. Shen et al.719 attempted to solve this issue, where acetylene black (AB) acts as the electron bridge that connects the nanosheets of g-C3N4 (CN) and CuS. The ternary CN–0.5%AB–2%CuS catalyst exhibited a H2 production rate of ∼348 μmol h−1 g−1, which was ∼348 and 1.5 times of those for pristine CN (∼1 μmol h−1 g−1) and CN–1%Pt (∼230 μmol h−1 g−1), respectively; the catalysts also had long-term durability. Notably, the AB nanoparticles act as oriented electron-transfer channels that improve separation and collection of photoexcited carriers and CuS stability, while the more active sites provided by the CuS increased the surface H2 evolution reaction. In addition, acetylene black and CuS increased the light absorption of the composite.

7.7.1 Double metal sulfide heterostructures with carbon or graphene. 
The use of hybridization with carbon materials and metal sulfide heterostructures are beneficial, whereby one constituent provides light absorption for the generation of an electrochemical potential, and the other provides more catalytic active sites for hydrogen production, and also enhances catalysts conductivity, e.g. using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) or carbon materials such as CNT.720–725 For example, Xiang et al.722 examined the photocatalytic activity of TiO2/MoS2/graphene composites. It was observed that rGO is beneficial for easing photogenerated electrons transport from TiO2 to MoS2 and for improving charge-separation properties, which resulted in a high H2 evolution rate of ∼165.3 μmol h−1 and the AQY was ∼9.7% at 365 nm, whereas the loading of the MoS2/graphene co-catalyst was 0.5 wt% and the content of graphene was 5.0 wt%. In addition, a ternary CdS/MoS2/graphene combination catalyst exhibited an improved photocatalytic activity for H2 generation compared with CdS, CdS–MoS2, and CdS–graphene materials.565,726
A ternary hierarchical composite of Cd0.5Zn0.5S–g-C3N4–MoS2 was developed by Gogoi et al.727 Due to band gap alignment and effective charge separation, the Cd0.5Zn0.5S–g-C3N4–MoS2 material had an excellent photocatalytic performance of ∼68 μmol h−1 for 0.02 g catalyst. As a result of improved optical absorption, the NiS-MoS2/CNTs/CN catalyst showed a H2 generation rate of ∼309.9 μmol h−1 g−1 with long-term durability.728 The optimal loading of layered WS2/graphene hybrid (WG; amount ∼4.2 wt%) acted as a co-catalyst in the CdS/WS2/graphene composites, and resulted in a visible light photocatalytic H2 generation rate of ∼1842 μmol h−1 g−1 with AQY of ∼21.2% at 420 nm.729 A 2.0 wt% of MoS2/graphene co-catalyst used a MoS2/g-CdS composite and achieved the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of ∼1.8 mmol h−1 in a lactic acid solution equivalent to an AQY of 28.1% at ∼420 nm, which was not only greater than the sacrificial solutions of Na2S–Na2SO3 of ∼1.2 mmol h−1 but considerably larger than Pt/CdS in a solution of lactic acid.565 Similarly, Ha et al.730 prepared a Cu2ZnSnS4/MoS2–rGO heterostructure, in which a high density of nanoscale surface interaction between Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and MoS2/rGO hybrid was attained through in situ growth of CZTS nanoparticles on the surface of MoS2/rGO. As a result of the structural interface, see Fig. 46, a 90 wt% CZTS on 10 wt% MoS2/rGO showed an excellent photocatalytic activity of H2 generation in terms of ∼52 μmol g−1 h−1, which was higher than pristine Cu2ZnSnS4, Pt/Cu2ZnSnS4, and Au/Cu2ZnSnS4. Zhu et al.731 investigated the effect of La and rGO content in ZnIn2S4 respectively. A photocatalytic H2 production rate of 1.0RGO/1.0La–ZnIn2S4 of ∼2255 μmol g−1 h−1 was achieved. Zhang et al.732 prepared a ternary ZnxCd1−xS-based material with NiS and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). In this system, rGO acted as an electron collector and transporter and provided active reduction sites for H2 production. In addition, the metal sulfide of NiS served as an active oxidation site to collect photogenerated holes due to the creation of nanoscale p–n junctions between NiS and ZnxCd1−xS nanoparticles. As a consequence, the NiS–rGO–ZnxCd1−xS photocatalyst reached a maximum H2 production rate of ∼375.7 μmol h−1, which surpassed the rate gained for Zn0.5Cd0.5S/rGO and NiS alone by ∼1.8 and 1.6 times, respectively. The technology of heterostructure formation with carbon materials has been widely used to modify a variety of UV-light-active photocatalysts.112,724,733

7.8 Porosity effects
CdS attached to WO3/WS2 nanorods (NRs) have been fabricated by Wang et al.734via a two-step process. It was observed that the surface area was increased by ∼1.8 times due to the addition of 40 wt% CdS on WO3/WS2. The heterostructure is also a key factor for the photocatalytic performance. As a result, the optimized CdS/WO3/WS2 NRs nanocomposite exhibited ∼11.4 times enhancement in photocurrent and it was six times better than WO3/WS2 nanorods. As shown in Fig. 47(i), Yang et al.735 prepared porous ZnS/Ag2S nanostructures with different pore dimensions. During photocatalytic testing, the Ag2S nanocrystals acted as hole scavengers, as a result, without any co-catalysts, the porous nanosheets displayed a high photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of ∼104.9 μmol h−1 g−1. Benefitting from a two step aqueous process, Pt loaded nanoporous CdS nanostructures, including nanosheets and hollow nanorods were prepared by Bao et al.373 The nanoporous CdS nanosheets exhibited sizes up to ∼60 nm and an average thickness of ∼9 nm; where the hollow nanorods of CdS revealed ∼30 nm lengths with ∼7–14 nm outer diameters. Moreover, the achieved CdS nanostructures exhibited ∼3 nm diameter nanopores and a high BET surface area of ∼112.8 m−1 g−1. As a consequence, a high photocatalytic H2 yield of ∼4.1 mmol h−1, corresponding to the highest AQY of ∼60.34% measured at 420 nm. This improvement was due to effective charge separation, rapid photogenerated carrier transport, and a rapid photocatalytic reaction at the CdS/electrolyte interface due to the large surface area, porous nature and optimized chemical composition.

Reproduced from ref. 737 with permission from American Chemical Society, copyright 2011. 
Recently, using an polyol-mediated hot-injection synthesis technique, Shang et al.597 prepared a variety of photocatalysts such as spherical flower-like ZnIn2S4 superstructure with a diameter of ∼500 nm composed of 2–3 nm thick ultrathin mesoporous nanosheets, and other metal sulfide nanostructured photocatalysts of quantum dots of CdS, nanorods of Bi2S3, In2S3 hierarchical flower and SnS spheres. Owing to the outstanding specific surface area, the 1 wt% Pt loaded ZnIn2S4 hierarchical superstructure catalyst exhibited proficient visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 generation (612 μmol h−1 g−1) compared with flower-like ZnIn2S4 microspheres synthesized via a conventional hydrothermal technique. This enhanced performance was attributed to the larger surface area (128 m2 g−1), which may provide more photocatalytic active sites and adsorb a large number of photons and reactants. To examine the effect of doping of La3+ and porosity on the photocatalytic performance of the ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst, a series of La3+-doped porous ZnIn2S4 were prepared by Tian et al.736 The results indicated that La existed in the form of La2O3 on the ZnIn2S4 petals surface. A higher amount of La decreased the crystallite size of ZnIn2S4 and stimulates ZnIn2S4 micro-sphere of flower-like morphology, which also increased the surface area and pore volume, and create rich defects in ZnIn2S4. As a result, the photocatalytic HER efficiency was increased by ∼142% after adding 1.0 wt% La on ZnIn2S4. Without using a noble metal co-catalyst, the bare CuS/ZnS porous nanosheets attained a high photocatalytic H2 generation rate of ∼4147 μmol h−1 g−1 at 2 mol% of CuS loading and an AQY of 20% at 420 nm,737 as shown in Fig. 47(ii). This enhanced activity was due to the photoinduced interfacial charge transfer from the catalyst valence band of ZnS to CuS, which results in the reduction of incomplete CuS to Cu2S and thus improves the H2 generation reaction. The porous structure also facilitated the transport of reactants and products over the internal space due to the organized porous network assisting in using back reflected light due to the increased surface area and light scattering inside the porous structure.
Bai et al.738 reported on microspheres of ZnIn2S4 with a high surface area of ∼165.4 m2 g−1 made by a cetylpyridinium bromide (CPBr) aided hydrothermal process. The concentration of CPBr and pH significantly affected the electrocatalytic reactions and ZnIn2S4 formed at pH = 2 had a higher photocatalytic activity of ∼1544.8 μmol h−1 g−1, which was credited to its flower-like microsphere surface morphology with a pore assembly which supported electron and hole transfer. A mesoporous structure and a chain-like surface morphology with large surface area and high pore volume of monoclinic CaIn2S4 was produced via a high-temperature sulfurization method.739 It was then modified with 0.5 wt% Pt nanoparticles, and due to this structural feature a high HER rate of ∼30.2 μmol h−1 under visible light with good stability was realized in Na2S/Na2SO3 aqueous solution. Due to the large surface area (∼47 m2 g−1) of the PdS/ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 photocatalysts, Yu et al.740 achieved ∼780 μmol h−1.
7.9 Effect of defects
Among several photocatalysts, ZnS is one of the most commonly studied photocatalysts for H2 generation; however its wide band gap limits its activity to the UV region. Hence, Feng et al.741 proposed experimental and DFT analysis to facilitate ZnS to improve performance for H2 evolution using defect engineering and phase junction construction. Initially, it was suggested that the controlled vacancies of sulfur in a wurtzite structure phase of ZnS could provide photosensitization components for facile charge creation under visible light conditions and active sites for effective electron use. The synergetic sphalerite–wurtzite (S–W) structure phase junctions control the photoinduced charge separation and charge-transfer kinetics, while the ZnS with optimized phase junctions and extreme sulfur vacancies offered considerable photocatalytic activity. Hence, both sulfur vacancies and an S–W junction for ZnS (temperature 200 °C) led to a high photocatalytic H2 generation of ∼18 μmol h−1 g−1. Later, the same group742 prepared an organic–inorganic hybrid semiconductor of D-ZnS(en)0.5 with abundant defect states through grain boundary engineering, see Fig. 48(i). Due to the enriched defect state excitation and elevated electrical properties, D-ZnS(en)0.5 revealed an enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of ∼242.6 μmol h−1 g−1, which was ∼22 times greater than that of defect free ZnS(en)0.5 (∼11.0 μmol h−1 g−1). Likewise, Hao et al.743 introduced zinc vacancies (VZn) in ZnS through the addition of sodium sulfide as a sulfur source. The rich zinc vacancies on ZnS were observed by fluorescence spectroscopy and XPS analysis. Notably, the Zn vacancies could increase the valence band (VB) position that deteriorates the oxidative nature of the holes to shield ZnS-vacancies in ZnS from photo-corrosion. As a result, zinc-deficient ZnS (ZnS-2.5) with the most appropriate level of Zn vacancies showed higher photocatalytic performance for H2 production, of ∼337.71 ± 3.72 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible-light; high photostability was also observed.

Reproduced from ref. 744 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2018. 
Recently, Zhang et al.744 prepared defect-rich O-integrated 1T-MoS2 nanosheets (DRM), and defect free 1T-MoS2 nanosheets (DFM) by a facile hydrothermal process through the addition of high and small amount of thiourea precursor, respectively. Their hybrids were also prepared by DRM or DFM with CdS nanorods (indicated as DRM-C and DFM-C), as shown in Fig. 48(ii). A comparative investigation on DRM and DFM validated that the DRM co-catalyst displayed rich defects in the basal planes and edges of MoS2, and increased density of electro-active sites for the photocatalytic HER reaction. As a consequence, the elevated 20 wt% DRM-C revealed a visible-light driven photocatalytic H2 generation rate of ∼132.4 mmol h−1 g−1, greater than that of 20 wt% DFM-C (∼102.1 mmol h−1 g−1), bare CdS (∼20.0 mmol h−1 g−1) and Pt/CdS (∼89.0 mmol h−1 g−1). In addition, Zhang et al.745 prepared defect rich CdS@MoS2 through a one-step growth of oxygen fused defect-rich ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets on the CdS surfaces with irregular openings. As a result, the CdS@MoS2 exhibited maximum H2 generation rate of ∼17203 μmol h−1 g−1 and an AQY of ∼24.2% at 420 nm using sacrificial agents of Na2S/Na2SO3, which was ∼47.3 and ∼14.7 times greater than pristine CdS (∼363.8 μmol h−1 g−1) and 3 wt% Pt/CdS (∼1173.2 μmol h−1 g−1), respectively. The enhanced H2 production was attributed to the formation of adjacent heterojunctions between the CdS and MoS2, which improve the charge transfer capacity and hinder electron–hole pair recombination. Moreover, the defects in the MoS2 provide extra active sites for sulfur atoms on the exposed edge sites, and oxygen incorporation minimizes the energy barrier for facile H2 evolution reaction and increases the electrical conductivity of MoS2.
7.10 Processing temperature effects
A temperature effect, such as calcination or annealing temperature, is a common method to execute structural reformation in bulk materials and reduce structural defects in materials. Appropriate annealing was shown to be effective in increasing the performance of several photocatalysts. Jing et al.575 investigated the photocatalytic HER activity of high temperature (200–500 °C) treated CdS photocatalyst, which resulted in the growth of a highly stable and highly active CdS photocatalyst. In addition, during photocatalytic testing, CdS treated at 400 °C was found to be highly stable against both photo-corrosion and oxidation in air. As a consequence, the CdS-400 °C photocatalyst revealed an AQY and conversion efficiency of ∼24.1% and ∼6.35%, respectively. A broad range annealing temperature of 150–500 °C revealed either cubic, a combination of cubic and hexagonal, or hexagonal CdS nanocrystals.746 In particular, the cubic CdS was stable at ∼500 °C for 0.5 h, and after 1 h annealing, it was transformed to hexagonal CdS. An appropriate temperature effect to achieve a mixture of cubic and hexagonal CdS showed a higher photocatalytic activity compared to bare cubic or hexagonal CdS. Similarly, Wang et al.747 attained an improved conductivity for CdS after calcination of 400 °C for several hours. The enhanced conductivity and close interface between Cd and CdS resulted in an improved photocatalytic activity. After calcination the defects on the CdS system also increased, which also influenced photocatalytic performance.748 Xing et al.749 prepared Cd1−xZnxS (x = 0–0.92) photocatalysts via a co-precipitation method followed by calcination at 723 K in N2 atmosphere. The photocatalyst band gaps were ∼2.20–3.12 eV (x = 0–0.92), which was almost linear with composition of x. Notably, the conduction band position of the solid solution was shifted to a more negative potential compared to pristine CdS. Owing to this band gap reduction, the Cd0.62Zn0.16S photocatalyst showed the highest AQY of ∼2.17% (under UV light) and ∼0.60% (under visible light). It was thought that the size of the crystallite, the (1 0 1) plane and energy gap of Cd1−xZnxS photocatalysts had a strong impact on the H2 production efficiency. Chen et al.750 reported that, MoSx/CdS (PT) photocatalyst performance increases progressively with an increase of calcination temperature and a clear surface morphology change was detected at ∼773 K. Recently, Tian et al.751 examined the synthesis of ZnIn2S4via a hydrothermal method. As the temperature was steadily increased, there was an improvement in total pore volume, pore diameter, and surface area which regulated the photocatalytic activity. As result, a H2 production rate of ∼248.9 mmol g−1 h−1 was achieved for ZnIn2S4 prepared at 160 °C.
7.11 Perspectives on photocatalytic hydrogen generation
Several metal sulfides, such as MoS2 and WS2, have exhibited excellent activities as a co-catalyst for the modification of several photocatalysts, which reduces the activation energy, Tafel slope and overpotential for photocatalytic H2 evolution process. The functional properties of these metal sulfides depend on their crystalline nature, their amount, and layer arrangement. In addition, their appropriate band gap, eco-friendly nature and low-cost have made several metal sulfide nanomaterials potential candidates for environmentally sustainable photo-responsive materials, in particular for photocatalytic hydrogen generation applications. These materials are summarized in Table 5. However, most mono-metal sulfides and bi-metal sulfides have poor performance for photocatalytic H2 generation, since many of the metal sulfide materials suffer from photodegradation, which limits their long-term durability. In addition, to enhance the performance without structural or sulfur deficiencies, it is essential to use sacrificial agents to improve performance. However, creating heterojunctions or doping with anions or cations will expose more active sites, prevent agglomeration and amalgamation, and achieve electronic structure modification of the nanoparticles. As a result, charge carrier separation and electron transport can be enhanced, leading to the improved photocatalytic activity. In addition, heterojunctions can reduce the required activation energy and overpotential for photocatalytic H2 generation. Based on the above results, metal sulfide photocatalysts have shown to be future candidates to replace Earth's rare and high cost precious metal catalysts such as Pt and Ru for the production of innovative photocatalysts with improved photoactivity and long-term robustness.

8. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting by utilizing metal sulfides
8.1 PEC photoanodes
Photoanode materials are responsible for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and they must be a semiconducting material, have an energy gap that can harvest wide range of solar spectrum, and act as an efficient charge collection with high charge carrier mobility. Moreover, the constituents need to be stable in an aqueous environment, be low-cost, and eco-friendly.424,426,752 This section will focus on semiconductors of metal sulfides that have been studied as a photoanode in PEC solar water splitting. It is known that the PEC performance of a photoanode material is affected by its structure and morphology, including crystal structure, particle size, electronic nature, surface morphology, and defects in both surface and bulk substances.1,425,753–755 Therefore, enhancement in performance can be achieved by optimising these features. For instance, semiconductors such as several metal sulfides, e.g. CdS,756–759 Bi2S3,760,761 PbS,762–764 SnS,765–772 Sb2S,773 Ag3CuS2774 and CuInS2,775–777 which absorb visible light, can act as sensitizers that are capable of transferring electrons to the wide band gap semiconductors such as ZnO, SnO2 or TiO2, and thereby increase photoelectrochemical water splitting performance.

8.1.1 CdS based photoanodes. 
Due to the quantum confinement effect, nanosized CdS was chosen as a prototype system for several PEC systems.564,778 For instance, Sun et al.779 attained a PEC efficiency of ∼4.15% for a CdS–QDs sensitized TiO2 nanotube array photoelectrode. In addition, Lee et al.419 proposed that the alignment of Fermi-levels between CdS and CdSe could create optimum band-edge levels in the TiO2/CdS/CdSe electrode, which is beneficial for solar water splitting performance. As a result, from Fig. 49(i), the TiO2/CdS/CdSe photoanode revealed a saturated photocurrent of ∼14.9 mA cm−2, which was ∼3 times higher than the bare TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdSe electrode. Similarly, Chi et al.780 observed the effect of decreased charge combination on CdS–QDs into a TiO2 mesoporous film, which exhibited a high efficiency of ∼3.7% under visible light.

Reproduced from ref. 788 with permission from Springer Nature, copyright 2016. 
Due to the 1D CdS nanostructure, it is perfectly aligned with wide band gap materials such as TiO2,756,781 ZnO,782–784 CuGaSe2,785 and ZnFe2O4;783 these have been combined into CdS nanostructures to build heterojunctions for well-organized solar energy conversion systems. Notably, Wang et al.786 prepared CdS/CdSe core–shell nanorod arrays through deposition of CdSe on hydrothermally produced CdS nanorods, which resulted in CdS nanorod arrays encapsulated by a uniform CdSe layer. This core–shell feature exhibited a higher optical absorbance and exposed absorption edges on the films. In addition, it was confirmed that the CdS/CdSe was also shaped as an effect of the Fermi level alignment, thus a maximum photocurrent of ∼5.3 mA cm−2 was attained for the CdS/CdSe core–shell photoanode, which was ∼4 and ∼11 times of the bare CdS and CdSe photoanodes, respectively. Recently, Zhang et al.787 fabricated a thin film of core/shell nanorods of CdS/ZnS dense arrays via aerosol-assisted CVD (AACVD) method. The photoanode of CdS/ZnS arrays had higher visible light driven PEC activity with a photocurrent density of ∼7.8 mA cm−2 (0 V vs. SCE), which was ∼4 times higher than the bare CdS. Later, the same group788 attained ∼14.0 mA cm−2 (0 V, vs. SCE) for core/shell/shell nanorod (css-NR) of CdS/Zn1−xCdxS/ZnS photoanode, see Fig. 49(ii), which was ∼8 times higher than a pristine CdS nanorod array. The enhanced PEC performance was mainly attributed to ∼12 nm sized ultrathin Zn1−xCdxS layers on the interface of CdS/ZnS core/shell nanorods, and the formation of a heterojunction. Previous investigations have shown that CdS could be embedded onto planar surface-functionalized semiconducting materials to form large surface area heterostructured photoanodes for efficient photoactive response in a redox electrolyte.789–792 The spectroscopic and PEC experiments indicate that quantum size confinement, and hence the controlled absorption edge of CdS, which revealed efficient photosensitization of the CdS/TiO2 photoelectrode.793
Similarly, a CuInS2 nanocrystal film was formed between the TiO2 photoelectrode and CdS to suppress charge recombination in CuInS2-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes.794 A heterostructured Au NPs/CdS/LaBTC MOFs photoanode showed long-term stability.795 However, several researchers indicated that the thin film thickness,419,796 temperature and lattice parameter791,797 of the metal sulfides shell limited the function of the tunneling junction layer. In addition, a few materials also exhibited a low efficiency, which is often the effect of charge recombination between the electrolyte and photoelectrodes.798–800


8.1.2 Ag2S, ZnS and SnS based photoanodes. 
The large absorption coefficient of Ag2S (Eg = 0.9 to 1.05 eV) makes it an important material for PEC water splitting. The PEC activity of a CdS/Ag2S/TiO2/ITO photoelectrode801 indicated that the Ag2S nanocrystals coating could not only improve the optical absorption of CdS/TiO2/ITO photoelectrode, but also efficiently reduce charge recombination between the TiO2 and electrolyte, which could increase the overall efficiency of CdS-sensitized TiO2/ITO photoelectrode. Similarly, Yu et al.802 prepared p–n heterostructures of Cu2ZnSnS4–Ag2S photoanode for PEC analysis. As shown in Fig. 50(i), the photoanode displayed the highest photocurrent density of ∼0.58 mA cm−2 under visible light irradiation, which was ∼10 times greater than that of the bare CZTS (∼0.06 mA cm−2). However, a decrease in photocurrent was observed by further increasing the Ag2S amount.

Reproduced from ref. 810 with permission from American Chemical Society, copyright 2015. 
As discussed in previous sections (see Sections 4 and 7.4), bulk ZnS is only responsible for operation in the UV region. In order to make it active under visible light to drive PEC water splitting, Kurnia et al.803 used defect engineering to fabricate a ZnS nanostructure, and hence the electronic states were altered to enable substantial optical absorption of light at energies lower than the band gap energy of bulk ZnS. As a result, they attained the band gap of ∼2.4 eV for defected ZnS thin films, whereas the PEC photocurrent density reached ∼1.5 mA cm−2 under visible-light condition (λ ≥ 435 nm). In addition, for a ZnS photocatalysts it has been estimated from first-principles analyses that the wurtzite phase would have a greater reducing ability than the blende phase of ZnS due to the developed energy of the conduction band.804,805 Therefore, the ZnS phase has a significant impact on PEC performance. Later, the same group806 achieved a high photocurrent density for wurtzite ZnS with high incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 4.3%, see Fig. 50(ii). In addition, the adjustment of the pulsed laser deposition synthesis conditions led to defect states in the ZnS thin films, which resulted in enhanced visible-light absorption, facile charge separation, and a photocurrent of ∼1.6 mA cm−2 was obtained.803
ZnS modification has been found to play an important role in determining the photocatalytic efficiency. The surface defects could act as a charge carrier trap centers as well as adsorption sites where the photogenerated charge carriers can be transported to the adsorbed species, therefore inhibiting the recombination of electron–hole pairs and effective charge separation. Consequently, numerous studies have explored the light absorption performance of a ZnS photoanode. For example, doping ZnS with metal ions such as Mn, Cd, Ni, and Cu has improved the performance under visible light irradiation.807–809 Recently, Huang et al.807 used a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method to prepare Ni-doped ZnS thin films. After annealing at 500 °C, the Ni-doped ZnS thin films exhibited a photocurrent density of ∼0.65 mA cm−2 at 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.5 M K2SO4 electrolyte solution, which was higher than the undoped ZnS films (∼0.25 mA cm−2). As shown in Fig. 50(iii), under 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution, the N-doped ZnS showed an excellent stability with a high photocurrent density of ∼1.6 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, while the bare ZnS reached ∼1.0 mA cm−2 at the same potential.810 Owing to the ZnO/ZnS/Au heterostructure nature, the photoelectrode reached a maximum IPCE efficiency of 0.21%, which was ∼3.5 times higher than pristine ZnO.811 Notably, the modification of the Au NPs on ZnO/ZnS encouraged effective surface charge passivation and surface plasmon resonance effects, and an increased photoelectrochemical performance was attained in both UV and visible light conditions. In addition, the interlayer of ZnS is preferred for the transport of photogenerated carriers under UV light and hot electrons under visible light, initiating their injection into ZnO; this instantaneously inhibited the electron–hole recombination at the interface of the photoanode–electrolyte to improve PEC performance.
The band gap of SnS is appropriate to use the complete solar spectrum. However, compared to other metal sulfides, the SnS efficiency is restricted by charge carrier recombination at the grain boundaries and sulfur vacancies.812 To improve the photoanode efficiency, SnS doped with Sb,813 Ag,814,815 Cu816 and In817 for solar water splitting applications have been investigated. Both In- and Sb-doped SnS have been prepared via electrochemical deposition by Seal et al.818 Due to the reduced band gap, the Sb doped SnS revealed better PEC performance than In-doped SnS.


8.1.3 WS2, MoS2 and Bi2S3 based photoanodes. 
Both the valence band and conduction band positions of WS2 are higher than MoS2.819 Thus, the hybridization of WS2 and TiO2 can lead to the development of a type-II heterostructure, so that electron–hole separation activity is expected to be superior to MoS2–TiO2. Based on this structural influence, nanosheets of WS2 can provide a synergetic coupling effect with TiO2 and the WS2–TiO2 heterostructures exhibited higher optical response than bare TiO2. Zhang et al.820 prepared a Au/MoS2/ZnO NRs/FTO photoelectrode, which consisted of vertically aligned few layer MoS2 with ZnO nanorod arrays, where the Au was deposited for a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. In 1.0 M Na2SO4, the photoanode exhibited improved photo activity compared to bare samples under UV light and red light illumination. These results provide insights in understanding the electronic and optoelectronic properties of vertically aligned MoS2 heterostructures. Liu et al.821 observed that a MoS2/CdS film with a ratio of 0.14% displayed the maximum photocurrent density of ∼28 mA cm−2 and the increased IPCE of ∼28% at 420 nm at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The enhanced performance of the MoS2/CdS heterojunction electrode was ascribed to the visible light absorption enhanced by MoS2 edge sites and the creation of a p–n junction among CdS and MoS2, which facilitates the effective photogenerated carrier separation via the internal electrostatic field in the heterojunction region. Jiang et al.822 investigated the impact of MoS2 and CdS in the formation of heterostructure of In2S3/CdS/MoS2 and In2S3/MoS2/CdS. From Fig. 51(i), their results revealed that transient photocurrent responses of both the photocatalysts of In2S3/CdS/MoS2 and In2S3/MoS2/CdS were quite different, which suggests that the structural arrangements and deposition sites have a significant effect on charge migration and photocatalytic activity. Recently, Liu et al.823 prepared pure CdTe QDs, Bi2S3 NRs, and CdTe–Bi2S3 heterojunctions by a hydrothermal method. During visible light driven PEC water splitting, the photocurrent of bare CdTe QDs and Bi2S3 NRs were ∼70 nA and 450 nA, respectively. After the combination of CdTe QDs with Bi2S3 NRs, the CdTe–Bi2S3 heterojunction displayed photocurrent of ∼2 and ∼13 times higher than the Bi2S3 NRs and CdTe QDs. Their experimental results suggested that the CdTe–Bi2S3 heterojunction could increase the photocurrent due to the reduction of the photoexcited electron–hole pairs in the CdTe–Bi2S3 composite.

Similarly, a WO3/Bi2S3 nanorods composite824 prepared with a seed layer revealed a superior photocurrent density of ∼5.95 mA cm−2 at 0.9 V vs. RHE, which was ∼35 and ∼1.4 times greater than bare WO3 and WO3/Bi2S3 heterostructure without a seed layer, respectively. Moreover, a higher IPCE of ∼68.8% and photoconversion efficiency ∼1.70% were attained. The improvement was due to the better light absorption, effective charge transport, and high carrier density. Similarly, a Bi2S3 nanobelt/WO3 nanoplate array exhibited an excellent photocurrent density of ∼8.91 mA cm−2 at −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the 0.1 M Na2SO3 and 0.1 M Na2S.825 The outstanding PEC activity of the photoanode was credited to the well-organized charge transfer and improved surface areas in the photoelectrode. In addition, due to the lower interface defects, the Bi2S3/WO3 photoelectrode exhibited a photocurrent density of ∼8.0 mA cm−2 at −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl under visible light irradiation.826 Taking advantage of the large surface area and longer direct electron path of the Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR structure, Wan et al.827 attained the maximum efficiency of ∼2.23%, which was ∼9 times higher than bare TiO2 (0.25%).


8.1.4 Other mono-metal based photoanodes. 
FeS2 (EBG = 0.95 eV) has been used in a photoelectrochemical cell to demonstrate 2.8% solar to electrical energy efficiency.828 The potential of pyrite (FeS2) thin films as a photoanode for PEC water splitting promoted by visible light absorption has been widely investigated. Barawi et al.829 fabricated n-type FeS2 on titanium substrates and during testing the flat band potential was −0.75 ± 0.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which resulted the high efficiency of ∼8% for H2 generation. Kmentova et al.830 stated that, after the sulfidation of iron oxide, the pyrite iron disulfide had a lower photocurrent density of ∼4 μA cm−2 at 600 mV vs. Ag/AgCl compared to the metal oxide of iron. This was due to the fast photogenerated charge recombination nature of Fe2S. Due to the heterostructure formed, Kuo et al.831 attained a maximum photocatalytic H2 production rate of ∼331 μmol h−1 g−1 for a FeS2–TiO2 photoanode, as shown in Fig. 51(ii), which was higher than FeS2 nanocrystals (NCs) and TiO2 nanoparticles, since the FeS2 NCs in the FeS2–TiO2 heterostructures was acting as a photosensitizer.
Ehsan et al.832 reported the fabrication of β-In2S3 on FTO substrates by the AACVD method at temperatures of 300, 350 and 400 °C using a precursor of [In(S2CNRR′)3]·n(py) complexes. The β-In2S3 films made at 400 and 350 °C from the precursors exhibited high photocurrent densities of ∼1.25 and 0.65 mA cm−2 at 0.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl respectively. The enhanced performance was attributed to the surface morphologies of uniform structures and band gap shrinkage, which reduced photogenerated electron–hole recombination. Li et al.833 prepared a nanosheet array (NSA) based photoanode of an In2S3/ZnO heterojunction through ALD of ZnO over In2S3 NSAs, where the photoanode showed an increased light absorbance over a long wavelength range of 250–850 nm. The photoanode showed improved PEC performance with a photocurrent density of ∼1.642 mA cm−2 (at 1.5 V vs. RHE) and an IPCE of ∼27.64% at 380 nm (at 1.23 V vs. RHE), which was 70 and 116 times higher than bare ZnO and In2S3, respectively. The enhanced performance was attributed to type-II band alignment of the In2S3/ZnO heterojunction, which facilitated effective separation and collection of photogenerated charge carriers, specifically with the aid of positive bias potential, and increased PEC activity. Likewise, Li et al.834 reported that the PEC activity of ZnO/ZnS core/shell nanoarray was lower than 0.5 mA cm−2. After the addition of a CuS shell instead of ZnS, the ZnO/CuS showed an improved photocurrent density. Moreover, the combination of both sulfides formed a ZnO/CuInS2 core/shell nanoarray which exhibited the highest photocurrent density of ∼16.9 mA cm−2 at 0.29 V vs. SCE. Due to the broader light absorption and the enhanced electrical conductivity provided by the WO3/rGO/Sb2S3 heterostructure,835 the photoanode of WO3/rGO/Sb2S3 exhibited a high photocurrent density of ∼1.20 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G illumination, which was higher than WO3/Sb2S3 (0.27 mA cm−2) and WO3 (0.05 mA cm−2) photoelectrodes.


8.1.5 Bi-metal sulfides based photoanodes. 
Architectural control of a nanomaterial can have profound effects on PEC efficiency. Wang et al.836 prepared 1D/2D architectures of CdS nanowire (NW)/CdIn2S4 nanosheet (NS) and due to the type II band alignment and multidimensional nature of the heterostructure, as shown in Fig. 52(i), a high photocurrent density of 2.85 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE was attained without any co-catalyst. Cheng et al.837 prepared AgInS2via a sulfurization technique, in which the compounds were coated on an FTO substrate, during fabrication the molar ratio of Ag and In was varied. As a result, the highest photocurrent density ∼2.7 mA cm−2 at +0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode was obtained for AgInS2 photoelectrode, whereas the molar ratio of Ag/In was 0.92/0.90. It was stated that, for the Ag-rich condition, the Ag atoms may inhabit the indium sites, which results in p-type conductivity. An orthorhombic photoelectrode of Ag8SnS6 achieved a maximum PEC performance ∼2.5 mA cm−2 in sea water at 0.7 V vs. RHE,838 see Fig. 52(ii).

Reproduced from ref. 838 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2016. 
A Cu2SnS3 coated ZnO/FTO array was formed using electrodeposition839 which had a maximum photocurrent density of 0.46 mA cm−2 at 0.5 V vs. SCE in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte under light irradiation, which was ∼2.86 and 23 times higher than the pure Cu2SnS3 and ZnO, respectively. Liu et al.840 prepared ZnxBi2S3+x/WO3 photoelectrodes on a FTO substrate, which showed that QDs of ZnxBi2S3+x uniformly covered the entire surface of the WO3 plates, thereby forming a ZnxBi2S3+x/WO3 core/shell structure. Due to the structural and core–shell features, the ZnxBi2S3+x/WO3 photoelectrode displayed an excellent PEC activity, see Fig. 53(i), in terms of ∼7.0 mA cm−2 at −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl under visible light condition and good photo-stability. Similarly, due to the sensitization nature of 3–5 nm sized CuInS2 QDs on a TiO2 photoanode, Li et al.841 attained a maximum photocurrent density of ∼1.92 mA cm−2 at 0.23 V vs. RHE, whereas the energy conversion efficiency of ∼1.9% was under simulated solar illumination. Later, the same group842 attained a maximum photocurrent density of 16 mA cm−2 and energy conversion efficiencies of ∼13% at 0.34 V vs. RHE for 3.5–4.5 nm sized CuInS2 QDs on TiO2 photoanode. This enhanced performance was attributed to the heterojunction formation and sensitization of QDs on TiO2.

Reproduced from ref. 844 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2018. 
Moreover, Li et al.843 fabricated a ZnIn2S4 thin film on ITO via a spray pyrolysis method. Due to the reduced band gap, the photoanode revealed a photocurrent density of ∼490 μA cm−2 at 0.8 V vs. SCE in 0.1 M Na2SO3 electrolyte, with excellent stability. A hydrothermally prepared heterostructure photoelectrode of 2D ZnIn2S4 nanosheets/1D rutile TiO2 nanorods arrays (2D ZIS NS's/1D R-TNR's) allowed it to be used in a PEC water splitting reaction.844 This heterostructure offered lower resistance, a direct electron transport period and a reduced amount of recombination under back side illumination (BSI) and improved electron hole separation and transport in the 2D ZIS NS's/1D R-TNR's heterostructure. However, the photoanode demonstrated a poor PEC performance via front side illumination (FSI), since the surface of the 2D ZIS NS's block light at the surface. As a result, as shown in Fig. 53(ii), the improved ZIS/1D TNR showed a photocurrent density of ∼1.6 mA cm−2 for back side illumination over front side illumination (∼0.793 mA cm−2). Mahadik et al.266 prepared a ternary CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 hetero-architecture, whereas the photoanode was consisted of TiO2 nanorods, nanograins of CdS, and ZnIn2S4 nanosheets. Owing to this structural feature, the photoanode showed excellent optical absorption, large surface area and high photogenerated charge carrier transport. As a result, the CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 photoanode had an enhanced photocurrent density of ∼1.4 mA cm−2 at AM1.5, which was ∼3.7 and 2.3 times higher than that of pristine ZnIn2S4/TiO2 and CdS/TiO2 respectively.
Recently, Yuan et al.845 prepared ZnIn2S4/graphene composites using a low temperature wet chemical method. During the fabrication, the amount of graphene was set at 1 wt%, 3 wt%, 5 wt%, and 10 wt%, which revealed a modification on the electronic interactions between ZnIn2S4 and graphene. Due to the large surface area, separation of charge efficiency and prolonged life-time of photogenerated charge carriers, the composite of ZnIn2S4/graphene (∼3 wt%) showed an excellent visible light driven PEC water splitting photocurrent density of ∼4 mA at 0.63 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.2 M Na2SO4 (pH 6.8) aqueous solution.


8.1.6 Effect of processing temperature. 
Pawar et al.846 synthesized MoBi2S5 nanoflowers via a facile microwave method. After thermal treatment, the morphology was optimized and the photocurrent density was increased by ∼80% after annealing at 473 K, compared to the un-annealed sample. This was attributed to the band gap shrinkage from 2.0 to 1.75 eV and the increased crystallinity of MoBi2S5 nanoflowers after thermal treatment. Similarly, DeAngelis et al.847 synthesized a Sb2S3 photoanode by thermal evaporation onto FTO substrates. The samples were subjected to temperature treatments from 250 °C to 400 °C. As a result, the 300 °C treated sample exhibited an improved PEC photocurrent density of ∼600 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M Na2SO4 under 1 sun illumination, although photocorrosion was detected in this investigation. Similarly, the high optical absorption coefficient (α = 104 cm−1), a band gap shrinkage of ∼1.35 eV and the crystalline nature due to the temperature of sulfidation increased the PEC performance of a VS4 photoanode.848 Later, a temperature of 400 °C for annealed PbS QDNCs embedded on TiO2 nanotubes as a photoanode revealed the maximum photocurrent density of ∼3 mA cm−2 under visible light irradiation.849 It was revealed that decorating PbS with TiO2 nanotubes enhanced the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic activity. In addition, the decreased charge transfer resistance and the high optical absorption features made a 24-fold increase in the photocurrent density compared to pristine TiO2 nanotubes, see Fig. 54.

8.2 PEC photocathodes
For efficient solar water splitting, semiconducting constituents with high visible-light harvesting features and electrons and/or holes with enhanced mobility for charge separation are essential.850–852 Water splitting photocathodes are generally p-type semiconductors and must generate the required cathodic current to reduce water to hydrogen and must have high stability in aqueous environments. Optimal photocathode materials need to have the conduction band edge potential to be more negative than the hydrogen (H2) redox potential.853 Many earlier studies on electrochemical photocathodes focused on p-type silicon and III–V semiconductors.854–857 Recently, p-type semiconductors, including metal sulfides, have received significant attention. In this section, we review the variety of photocathodes materials studied to date, which include mono-metallic, bi-metallic sulfides, their heterostructures and the effects of temperature, defects and large surface area.

8.2.1 MoS2 based photocathodes. 
The manufacture of MoS2 with monolayer or flake-like morphologies that can improve catalytically active edge sites is of great importance. In order to enhance PEC performance, several research groups858–860 have integrated MoS2 catalysts on p-type silicon (p-Si; band gap ∼1.1 eV) by a variety of methods for photocathode applications, and at the same time they also observed an enhanced photochemical activity. For example, using simple drop-casting method, Ding et al.861 prepared 1T-MoS2/Si photocathodes and used it for PEC testing under an acid environment. A current density of ∼9.2 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE was obtained for 1T-MoS2/Si photocathodes, which was ∼4 times higher than the 2H-MoS2/Si photocathode (∼2.3 mA cm−2). This enhanced performance was accredited to the reduced charge-transfer resistances across the interfaces of the semiconductor/catalyst and catalyst/electrolyte. In addition, a 3D MoS2 on a TiO2-coated p-type Si photocathode was prepared by Andoshe et al.862 The 3D MoS2/TiO2/p-Si photocathode exhibited a low onset potential of ∼0.35 V with a current density of ∼37 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. 55(i), the passivation by MoS2 layers on TiO2/p-Si photocathode shifted the onset potential anodically by ∼0.76 V, as compared to the pristine TiO2/p-Si photocathode's onset potential. In addition, the passivation of the TiO2/p-Si with MoS2 layers provided long-term stable operation for ∼181 h without degradation. The obtained high performance in the 3D MoS2/TiO2/p-Si photocathode was credited to the larger number of exposed edge sites and grain boundaries. Later, Fan et al.863 prepared a MoS2 catalyst with ∼2 nm Al2O3 sheltered n+p-Si, where the Al2O3 acted as a passive and protective layer of the silicon surface; this layer prevented direct contact between the n+p-Si surface and the adjoining electrolyte. As a result, a low onset potential of ∼0.4 V vs. RHE and ∼35.6 mA cm−2 photocurrent density under Xe lamp (100 mA cm−2) illumination with a long-term durability of ∼120 h during continuous water splitting was attained. In addition, ultrathin MoS2 nanoflakes on Ag-core Si-shell nanospheres (Ag@Si NSs) were fabricated via CVD.864 Owing to the large surface area and high curvature of the Ag@Si NSs, the as-grown MoS2 nanoflakes had more active sites. Hence, a photocurrent density of ∼33.3 mA cm−2 at −0.4 V vs. RHE was obtained. Similarly, Tan et al.865 prepared photocathodes of amorphous MoSx (a-MoSx) on a TiO2/Sb2Se3 through over electro-deposition. They showed that the dissimilar chemical states of a-MoSx enriched photoelectrochemically active sites during fabrication, see Fig. 55(ii). Chen et al.866 tested the wide pH range operational range of Si/a-CoMoSx, that benefitted from the bi-metallic nature; this photoanode achieved a photocurrent density of ∼17.5 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE.

8.2.2 CdS based photocathodes. 
Due to the direct band gap of ∼2.4 eV, CdS is one of the most extensively studied metal sulfide material for solar water splitting applications, where its band edge positions are suitable for water splitting to produce oxygen and hydrogen.419,867 Despite these benefits, the performance of CdS is limited due to the photo-generated electrons and holes, which cannot be strongly separated and transferred.868,869 In addition, CdS undergoes photocorrosion in aqueous media, which limits its long-term durability.870,871 To overcome these challenges, efforts have been made to increase the stability and efficiency of CdS photoelectrodes, which includes the use of 1D and 2D CdS and/or heterostructure formation of nanostructures since they offer substantial gains such as increased carrier collection efficiency and increased incident light absorption.872,873 However, a recent study showed that the low hole transfer rate was the efficiency-limiting factor in a CdS-based heterostructure.874 For instance, as shown in Fig. 56(i) a relatively high photocurrent of ∼12.08 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE was attained for PEC cell using Pt/TiO2/CdS/CBTSSe (x ≈ 3) photocathode.875 To avoid Cu2S oxidation and phase changes during PEC testing, deposition of CdS has been used.876 As a result a Cu2S/CdS/TiO2/RuOx photocathode exhibited a photocurrent density of ∼7.0 mA cm−2 at −0.3 V vs. RHE and a low overpotential of ∼−0.48 V vs. RHE. Septina et al.877 reported that a buffer layer of (70 to 80 nm thick) CdS between the CuO and TiO2 increases the PEC photocurrent with the least dark current over a wide-range of applied potentials. The CuO/CdS/TiO2/Pt photocathode reached a maximum photocurrent density of ∼1.68 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, as shown in Fig. 56(ii). Similarly, Yokoyama et al.878 stated that CdS modification of a Cu(In,Ga)Se2 photocathode improved the photocurrent and onset potential, and the CdS deposited on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 created a p–n junction which was beneficial for enhancing charge separation for improved photocurrent and onset potential. By developing a p–n junction between CdS, CuGa3Se5 and modified (Ag,Cu) GaSe2 (ACGSe), Zhang et al.879 achieved a high cathodic photocurrent density of ∼8.79 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, and an onset potential of ∼0.62 VRHE over ∼20 days of uninterrupted hydrogen evolution. A CdS-coated p-CuGeSe2 exhibited a photocurrent density of over ∼10 mA cm−2vs. RHE and the efficiency was 0.83% at 0.2 V vs. RHE. Furthermore, this photoelectrode provided ∼10 days of continuous water splitting activity without any degradation.785 Yang et al.880 attained a high photocurrent density of ∼13 mA cm−2 at −0.2 V vs. RHE, where the photocathode was consisted of Pt/ALD-TiO2/CdS/CZTS and the improved photocathode achieved a relatively stable H2 production.

8.2.3 ZnS based photocathodes. 
Due to its production of transportable photo excited electron–hole pairs and high conduction band potential with fast electron transfer,881,882 ZnS is a promising candidate for solar water splitting. Additionally, it has a high number of active sites for solar water splitting without the need for a classical charge transfer co-catalyst, such as Pt or RuO2. However, due to its wide band gap (∼3.6 eV), the photocatalytic activity is limited, and pure ZnS is only active under UV irradiation.883,884 Hence, several reports have attempted to improve the light absorption of a ZnS photocathode.776,873,885,886 Tuning of the manufacturing conditions can lead to defect states in ZnS thin films, which can also increase visible-light absorption, separation of charge, and photocurrent.885 Therefore, many studies have focused on the surface morphology and optical properties of ZnS based heterojunctions. Notably, sulfur-containing CIGS (Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2) with a ZnS surface layer has improved the photocurrent and stability of the CIGS photocathode. As a result, Chae et al.887 attained a high photocurrent density of ∼24 mA cm−2 at −0.3 V vs. RHE for CIGS/ZnS/Pt photocathode. Goto et al.888 fabricated a photocathode of (ZnSe)0.85(CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2)0.15 and it was modified with CdS/ZnS overlayers and a Pt catalyst to produce high photocurrent densities of ∼4.3 and ∼2.7 mA cm−2 at 0 and 0.3 V vs. RHE, respectively, under visible light irradiation. Modification using thin CdS and ZnS layers raises the cathodic photocurrent with the formation of a p–n junction.


8.2.4 Other metal sulfide photocathodes. 
The valence band of SnS comprises of hybrid orbitals of Sn-5s and S-3p, signifies that SnS can work as a p-type photocathode semiconductor. SnS is a naturally abundant material with a bandgap of ∼1.2–1.5 eV,889–891 which is favorable for efficient use of the solar spectrum. The SnS efficiency is thought to be limited by charge carrier recombination at the grain boundaries and sulfur vacancies.818 Based on DFT approaches, Shiga et al.24 predicted that SnS can be useful as a photocathode for solar H2 production in a sacrificial agent and environment. In addition, Xu et al.892 prepared ReS2 on conductive carbon cloth by a hydrothermal method. It was observed that ReS2@CFC exhibited a high cathodic photocurrent of 10 mA cm−2 at a low onset potential of 8 mV vs. RHE; see Fig. 57. This enhanced performance was due to active edge sites, optimized electronic band structure and lower Gibbs free energy (ΔGH) of hydrogen adsorption of ReS2/CFC.

Tuning the chemical composition of Cd with ZnS is also of interest for ZnS based systems, which delivers a prospect for improving PEC performance. For instance, the energy gap and solar water splitting efficiency of CdxZn1−xS (x = 0.3) reached ∼1.93 eV and −3.00 mA cm−2, respectively.893 Moreover, chalcopyrite structures have recently revealed remarkable photocathode performance for PEC water splitting due to their good photo-response.894 Copper indium disulfide (CuInS2) is one of the potential candidates to be used in thin film photocathode technology due to its high absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1) and direct bandgap (∼1.5 eV) in the wide range of the visible spectrum.895,896 In addition, it is eco-friendly and a variety of research groups have fabricated CuInS2 photocathodes.897,898 CuInS2 films modified with a thin layer of CdS and TiO2 were formed by Zhao et al.897 where the use of a thin layer improved the photocurrent and onset potential. In another report,891 after coating of Pt catalyst, CdS, aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO), and TiO2 over layers on CuInS2 the as-prepared hybrid photocathode revealed a photocurrent density of ∼3.5 mA cm−2.
Copper gallium disulfide (CuGaS2) has been used as a photocathode material to a lower extent than CuInS2, since it has a direct wide band gap of ∼2.4 eV.899 The conduction band of CuGaS2 is located at a more negative potential than semiconducting CuInS2, which makes it as a promising photocathode for PEC water splitting.900,901 Recent investigations proposed that doping of a CuGaS2 film with a co-catalyst such as Ti and Zn can alter the crystalline structure and surface morphology of a CuGaS2 photocathode.902 In addition, Mathews et al.903 prepared a Cu2SnS3 photoelectrode on an FTO substrate using a sulfurization method. Owing to the high optical absorption of the cathode, a high photocurrent density of ∼0.3 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V vs. SCE was achieved in the 0.1 M NaCl aqueous electrolyte. Wang et al.904 attained a maximum current density of ∼6 mA cm−2 for Pt/CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4/Mo-mesh at a voltage of −0.35 V vs. RHE in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (pH = 9.5). This enhanced performance was attributed to the symmetry of the metal sulfides. Similarly, Kato et al.905 fabricated (CuGa)0.8Zn0.4S2 and Ru (1.0 wt%) loaded (CuGa)0.8Zn0.4S2 electrodes and the effect of calcination on PEC water splitting was evaluated. In the presence of sacrificial reagents, a Ru (1.0 wt%)-loaded (CuGa)0.8Zn0.4S2 sample exhibited a higher photocurrent than the bare materials. The high performance metal sulfide based photoelectrode materials and their performances are summarized in Table 6.

8.3 Perspectives on photoelectrochemical water splitting
Metal sulfide semiconductors have long been the topic of research for electronic and optical applications. Recently, metal sulfide materials have been used as a photoelectrode material for solar water splitting as photoelectrodes for hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) generation from water. Compared to electrochemical HER and photocatalytic HER, the use of PEC water splitting has received less research attention and there is potential for improvement. Edge sites, defect engineering and temperature effects can also improve the final device and materials performance for PEC applications. One challenge for the range of low-band gap photocathodes with a conduction band sufficiently high for PEC based H2 evolution (such as Cd and, CuGaS2) is that they are readily self-oxidized and S2− and SO32− are normally used as a sacrificial redox mixture in PEC experiments. However, a variety of methods such as electrodeposition, CVD or sulfurization have been used to enhance the performance of metal sulfide photocathodes; for example MoS2.866 However, their stability must be improved and therefore the creation of composites using graphene, carbon and other conductive materials is of interest to improve the performance and life-time of metal sulfide based PEC devices.
9. Stability of metal sulfides
One of the major difficulties encountered with advanced electrocatalysts or photocatalysts is achieving rational stability without compromising catalytic activity.906 Notably, catalyst with ultra-stability is crucial to construct and achieve efficient water splitting for a prolonged lifetime. As described earlier (see Section 7.4), a number of strategies such as heterostructure formations, doping, carbon/graphene composites formation, temperature effects, edge and defect engineering and porosity have been shown to improve the performance and stability of earth-abundant metal sulfide materials. These research efforts are aimed at improving the water splitting performance of the electro- or photo-catalyst. However, the aqueous medium of water splitting plays a crucial role in H2 or O2 production. Thus, it is challenging to find suitable electrocatalysts and/or photocatalysts that can split water in the same pH range. Using modeling,906 volcano curves have been acquired when plotting HER activity versus hydrogen binding energy (HBE) on various metal sulfides and their composites in an acid41,302,420,907 as well as in a base28,908,909 and proposing that an optimal HBE exists via Sabatier's principle.
While most of the recently advanced HER catalysts work well in acidic electrolytes, only a small number can operate in neutral and basic media. Almost all of the best photocatalysts, particularly those prepared using earth-abundant elements, can work well only in neutral or basic electrolytes, see Tables 4–6. In addition, the fabrication method of catalysts also plays a significant role in the catalytic activity and stability since it defines the chemical composition, structure, surface morphology and size of the catalysts,910–913 which directly influence the stability and performance through the interactions formed between the radicals of reactant (H2O, H2 and CO).
9.1 Electrocatalytic hydrogen generation
Recent studies on the HER activity of electrocatalysts at different pH values suggest that the pH of electrolytes strongly affects the stability of the catalyst. Large numbers of nanostructured mono-metal sulfides, such as WS2,446 CoS2,449 FeS2438 and MoS2138 have been evaluated for HER applications in a variety of media. Recently, Lee et al.914 reported that carboxyl group-functionalized MoS2 (i.e. f(COOH)–MoS2) exhibited a highly stable activity compared to n-MoS2 in a phosphate buffer with the pH adjusted to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 by a H2SO4 solution; this was mainly due to functional groups alleviating the defect sites of MoS2. As a result, it remains in its original structure after 1000 cycles of HER, since the COOH sites are surrounded by neighboring layers or defects and provide structural stability to the system. Benefitting from the nanoflake-like structure of FeS2, Giovanni et al.915 attained high HER in neutral water at room temperature with excellent catalytic stability exceeding six days of electrolysis. However, the stability of the mono-metal sulfide catalysts was further enhanced through the formation of bi-metal sulfides, heterostructures, doping or composite formation. For instance, Au decorated MoS2,916 monolayer MoS2 decorated Cu1.75S–Au nanocrystals,917 core–shell MoO3–MoS2 nanowires,918 NiS on Ni foam,557,919 graphene920 or carbon fiber paper921,922 have been fabricated by several methods including hydrothermal methods or physical vapor deposition to enhance HER activity; as a result various low overpotentials and reduced Tafel slopes have been attained with substantial stability. Bonde et al.302 observed the instability of CoSx, MoS2 and WS2 in H2SO4, whereas the HER activity competes with cathodic desorption or dissolution of CoSx. Simultaneously, the cobalt (Co) promoted WS2 and MoS2 revealed higher stability than bare CoSx, MoS2 and WS2 samples. In addition, the HER activity and long-term stability of the carbon supported MoS2 is comparable to that of Au(111) supported MoS2.41 A graphene coated 3D nickel foam was also used as a compact support for loading MoSx catalysts for HER.512 In addition, to serve as a conductive scaffold, the sheets of graphene grown on nickel foams also provide strong protection and efficiently increase their stability in an acidic environment.512 Compared with MoSx, CoSx catalysts are highly active, but less stable. Staszak-Jirkovsky et al.923 prepared a highly stable catalyst by linking the highly active CoSx with the higher stability of MoSx units to prepare robust CoMoSx, which could effectively catalyze HER in both alkaline and acidic environments with long-term stability.
9.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen generation
While water is an ideal source of hydrogen (H2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a potential alternate H2 source. Principally, the cleavage of H2S is easier than H2O, requiring a ΔG of ∼39.4 kJ mol−1 which is less than 284.7 kJ mol−1 necessary for water splitting.924,925 In addition, the H2 production rate from the H2S-containing base solution was similar to the rate from photocatalytic H2 production from water containing sacrificial reagents/donors (sodium sulfide with sodium sulfate; Na2S + Na2SO3) at the same concentration.576,822,926 For example, CdS based semiconducting photocatalysts are well known to be active in H2 production from water. Remarkably, the CdS photocatalyst mixed with other semiconducting materials such as ZnS,798,927 MoS2,928 TiO2929 and SrTiO3930 will exhibit high photocatalytic activity. Unfortunately, they undergo severe photocorrosion under light irradiation unless there exist hole scavengers in the electrolyte solution, such as sacrificial reagents based on sulfides (Sn2−) and sulfites (SO32−). When a sacrificial reagent (H2S or Na2S + Na2SO3) is dissolved into an alkaline solution, sulfide ions are formed in situ and play a key role in H2 production.418 Significantly, during photocatalytic testing, surface reactions take place in the presence of the mixed HS−/SO32− sulfide electron donor systems, whereas sulfite (SO32−) and bisulfide (HS−) are oxidized to SO42− and polysulfide ions, Sn2−, such as S42− and S52−, which impart a yellow color to the aqueous electrolyte suspension at high pH value.571,926 However, the polysulfide ions can also effectively suppresses the photoreduction of protons. In addition, the creation of yellow coloured polysulfide ions can be inhibited by a reaction with sulfite ions to give HS− and thiosulfate (S2O32−). Similarly, excess sulfide present in the solution stabilizes the metal sulfide photocatalyst surface by removing surface defects due to photocorrosion.747 By exploiting the stabilizing properties of these ions, researchers have achieved an efficient H2 production with long-term stability under light condition.254,349,564,931
In this aspect, recently, Simon et al.932 proposed that employing a hydroxyl anion/radical redox couple to strongly relay the hole from the Ni-decorated CdS semiconductor to the scavenger leads to an increase in the H2 generation rate with long-term durability; see Fig. 58(a). Under the laser (wavelength ∼447 nm) illumination, the AQY and the H2 production rate was ∼53% and ∼63 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively. Whereas, the aqueous electrolyte contained 1 M KCl and 0.1 M Na2SO3, the pH was adjusted using NaOH. Although the H2 production decreased to ∼20% after 80 h, it remained stable for up to ∼220 h; see Fig. 58(c and d). Similarly, Brahimi et al.933 prepared n-type Bi2S3/TiO2via a solvent thermal process. The heterostructured Bi2S3/TiO2 exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity and long-term stability of ∼70 min than Bi2S3. However, in an S2O32− electrolyte the n-type Bi2S3/TiO2 photocatalyst at pH ∼ 13.7 exhibited a H2 production rate of ∼2.9 μmol mg−1 h−1 which decreased gradually to zero near pH ∼ 7. Notably, at pH ∼ 7, the back reduction of end products of S4O62− and S22− reduced the H2 evolution rate.

9.3 Photoelectrochemical water splitting
The long-term stability of the semiconducting photoelectrode under light illumination is one of the important points in the prospect of photoelectrochemical water splitting reaction. Recently, several metal sulfide photoelectrodes were reported as a visible light active photoelectrode material for HER and/or OER reactions. However, metal sulfides such as CdS,934 ZnS,697 CdIn2S4,62 NiS2,935 CuS,693 and FeS2829 suffer from photocorrosion during the photocatalytic reaction where metal sulfide can be oxidized by photo-generated holes, and thus reduce performance. In order to improve the efficiency as well as the stability, co-catalysts of noble metals, non-precious metals, metal oxides, metal sulfides, carbon materials or polymers are necessary. In addition, to stabilize the metal sulfide photoelectrode, sacrificial electron donors have been employed (see Section 9.2). For example, Seger et al.936 prepared electrodeposited MoS2 on the titanium-protected n+p silicon electrode, this photocathode system showed improved performance compared to a bare silicon electrode in an acidic electrolyte, with a long-term stability of 1 h continuous operation. A MoS2 layered silicon photoelectrode showed no photocurrent loss in performance after 100 h of continuous operation under 0.5 M H2SO4 environments.937 In a phosphate solution (pH 4.25),866 the silicon coated amorphous cobalt molybdenum sulfide (Si/a-CoMoSx) photoelectrode showed an excellent HER activity with a photocurrent density of ∼17.5 mA cm−2vs. RHE. However, a small amount of current degradation about ∼1.5 mA was observed after 3 h operation. Likewise, Guio et al.938 prepared a Cu2O coated amorphous MoSx (MoS2+x–CV–Cu2O) by ALD and during PEC testing the MoS2+x–CV–Cu2O photocathode, exhibited photocurrents of ∼−4.5 mA cm−2 for 10 h; −2.0 mA cm−2 for 10 h and the photocurrent gradually decreased to below −1.0 mA cm−2 after 7 h at pH values of 4.0, 9.0 and 10 respectively. Remarkably, at pH ∼ 1.0, a sudden decrease in photocurrent was observed and this was attributed to the dissolution of catalysts by the acid environment. In addition, under neutral conditions, CdS/Pt-modified CIGS photocathodes exhibited a lower one set potential of 0.38 V vs. RHE with a long-term stability of 3 h continuous operation.939 Yang et al.940 prepared a photoanode of PbS, CdS and ZnS attached TiO2 by a sequential deposition method. It was observed that after the 4 h of light illumination, the PEC photocurrent density of the bare TiO2/PbS electrode gradually decreased from ∼72.3 mA cm−2 to ∼56.4 mA cm−2, with improved photostability attained for the TiO2/PbS/CdS (∼171 mA cm−2) and TiO2/PbS/CdS/ZnS (∼182.4 mA cm−2) under 4 h of light illumination in an electrolyte of Na2S with Na2SO3.
9.4 Hydrogen generation and stability analyses in sea-water
Hydrogen production from direct electrolysis of sea-water with robust electrocatalysts or photocatalysts is one of the great interests in green energy research. However, during sea-water electrolysis, high amounts of chlorine and hypochlorite are evolved at the anode through the oxidation of chlorine (Cl−; also called chlorine evolution reaction ClER) under alkaline and acidic environments,941,942 instead of oxygen evolution by the oxidation of water.34,943–945 However, the Pourbaix diagrams of electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from various pH values exhibited that the OER activity is thermodynamically favored.941,943 For instance, during PEC testing the anodic current density of Ag8SnS6 reduced from 1.61 to around 0.9 mA cm−2vs. RHE and from 2.1 to around 0.1 mA cm−2vs. RHE in aqueous 0.25 M K2SO3 + 0.35 M Na2S and 0.5 M NaCl solutions, respectively, during a 1000 s stability investigation.838 Later, the same group attained 800 s PEC water splitting stability of Cu–Sn–S photoanodes in 1 M NaCl aqueous solution under light condition.946 However, the water splitting reaction under sea-water is immature for metal sulfide systems.
Recently, Li et al.947 observed the effect of a NaCl electrolyte on the photocatalytic H2 evolution over Pt/Cd0.5Zn0.5S using the electron donor of glucose under visible light illumination. It was observed that, the H2 evolution rate linearly increased with increased NaCl concentration in 0.050 mol L−1 glucose with 0.10 mol L−1 NaOH solution. Notably, at <1.0 mol L−1 of NaCl concentration, the HER activity increased rapidly, while if the NaCl concentration was >1.0 mol L−1, the HER activity increased slowly. As a result, the H2 production rate at 3.0 mol L−1 NaCl was ∼1.77 times higher than 0 mol L−1 NaCl concentration in 0.050 mol L−1 glucose with 0.10 mol L−1 NaOH solution signifying that NaCl can improve the activity. In addition, this enhanced performance of Pt/Cd0.5Zn0.5S in 3.0 mol L−1 NaCl salt water was ∼77% higher than pure water with a long-term stability of 3 h. It was observed that, after the H2 production reaction, Na+ can be also adsorbed on the surface of Cd0.5Zn0.5S, see Fig. 59(a–c). Recently, Guo et al.79 prepared MoS2@TiO2 heterostructures via combined anodization, PVD, and CVD processes for photocatalytic H2 generation. They investigated the effect of NaCl salt on photocatalytic H2 generation activity of MoS2@TiO2 with natural sea-water (pH ∼ 8.4) under light irradiation. The H2 generation activity from seawater decreased compared to that of clean water, see Fig. 59(d), which was ascribed in terms of lower isoelectric point of MoS2 (<7) and adherence of hydroxyl radicals, metal ions, sulfides oxidation and dissolution could take place in the seawater with a weak alkaline background. In addition, Jiang et al.948 attained 50 h stability for Ni–S film in salt water at −0.959 V vs. SHE and this performance was lower than pure water with a wide range of pH values (0 to 14).

9.5 Perspectives on stability of metal sulfides
To date, there have been a range of strategies implemented to control corrosion, dissolution and increase the stability of metal sulfide catalysts for photocatalysts; these include (i) the use of sacrificial agents (such as H2S, Na2S with Na2SO3) in an electrolyte to act as a hole scavenging agent and consume holes that contribute to photocorrosion, (ii) covering, decorating or loading a passive metal on the semiconductor surface, which acts as a co-catalyst to improve the rate of oxygen production or hydrogen evolution process, (iii) modification or control of the semiconductor surface with a metal oxide, carbon based material or a polymer to isolate the semiconductor from the electrolyte, (iv) using nanostructuring methods to modify the electrode surface. These modification strategies can lead to an improved catalytic and photocatalytic performance of the metal sulfide materials with long-term durability in neutral, acidic and alkaline media. However, splitting of sea-water is often inhibited by the existence of chemical salts and impurities, which fouls the metal sulfide systems and increases the required bias voltage, reduces efficiency and limits long-term stability.
10. Applications and beyond electrocatalytic, photocatalytic HER and PEC water splitting
In renewable energy technologies, particularly, electrocatalytic and photocatalytic energy conversions have attracted increasing attention due to the need to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Impressively, metal sulfides with various combinations have also been used in several energy conversion systems such as ORR/OER for fuel cells, photocatalytic dye degradation and CO2 reduction. These are summarized in Scheme 3 and described in this section.
 Scheme 3  Overall technological applications of metal sulfide materials. 
10.1 Electrocatalysts for ORR/OER
Bi-functional electrocatalytic reactions such as ORR and OER are considered as two main energy related reactions in clean and sustainable energy system,949–952 including but not limited to, regenerative fuel cells949,953,954 and rechargeable metal–air batteries.955,956 Thus the advancement of efficient bi-functional oxygen catalysts toward both ORR and OER has become a topic of interest in energy conversion and storage research. However, the performance of ORR and OER catalysts is impaired by their slow kinetics which therefore requires a high overpotential to initiate these electrochemical reactions.957–959 Notably, Pt-based electrocatalysts are the best ORR catalysts,960–962 but they suffer from the formation of Pt oxides on the catalyst surface at high overpotentials which deter the catalytic ability of Pt for OER.503,963 Similarly, the highly active OER catalysts are also less active for ORR and vice versa. Notably, the elevated bi-functional ORR/OER catalyst should have the identical intermediate oxygen binding energies close to the theoretical equilibrium potential.
Ultrathin 2D metal sulfide nanostructures such as MoS2, WS2, and Co9S8 have shown interesting physical and chemical properties in energy conversion and storage research owing to their high surface to volume ratio, small ion and electron diffusion paths, large amount of surface exposed atoms, increased electronic conductivity and large catalyst–electrolyte interface.964–970 Such factors can increase the electrocatalytic activity of metal sulfides for surface-dependent electrochemical reactions. However, pure metal sulfide catalysts with different polymorphs continue to exhibit poor catalytic activity and require improvement. Conversely, the electrochemical performance of metal sulfide catalysts is highly dependent on surface morphology and structure with active crystallographic facets. It is known that the metal sulfides for ORR/OER catalysis possess reduced stability and weak oxygen sorption on the surface of metal sulfides, which in turn reduces the electrocatalytic activity.909,971,972 Therefore, significant effort has been dedicated to new synthetic methods involving mixing or using highly conducting support materials; e.g. carbon, ion or anion. Doping with an ion or anion or carbon and its derivatives, with high surface area, greater electronic conductivity, good mechanical properties, and outstanding chemical stability, are identified as providing improved conductive support for electrocatalysts.377,973,974 As a result, a number of reports have delivered exciting promise for ORR/OER performance enhancement.975–980
Recently, Hong et al.981 prepared hybrid structure of three different metal sulfides with N–S doped carbon matrix (i.e. MS@G/NSC, where M: Fe, Co, Ni). Remarkably, compared with NSC, MS@G/NSC (M: Co, Ni) and commercial Pt/C catalyst, owing to the hybrid feature, high conductivity and highly exposed active area, the FeS@G/NSC catalyst showed an excellent ORR activity in terms of lesser half-wave potential (E1/2) of ∼0.88 V vs. RHE and Tafel value of ∼30.9 mV dec−1, which indicating the influence of the synergistic effect between FeS and G/NSC. Likewise, owing to the high surface area, annealing effect and rich active sites, the composite of N, O and S-doped carbon encapsulated Co9S8 (Co9S8@TDC-900) catalyst showed an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards both the ORR (E1/2 ∼ 0.78 V vs. RHE) and OER (the overpotential of ∼0.330 V vs. RHE at 5.45 mA cm−2) with outstanding long-term stability in 0.1 M KOH solution.982 Recently, Yang et al.983 prepared multi-metal sulfide of CoNiFe-S by an anion-exchange method. Due to the mesoporous nature, the CoNiFe–S exhibited superior ORR and OER catalytic activity, providing E1/2 of ∼0.78 V vs. RHE for ORR; and a low overpotential of ∼199 mV vs. RHE at ∼10 mA cm−2 for OER in 1 M KOH solution. By using two step hydrothermal method, colloidal NiSx coupled with the S-rGO (NiSx/S-rGO) was prepared by Sumboja et al.984 Owing to the rich sulfur nature, high conductivity and the large surface area of the composite, the NiSx/S-rGO catalyst exhibited an excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in terms of a high ORR onset potential (Eonset) of ∼0.91 V vs. RHE and an excellent OER activity by low overpotential of ∼301 mV vs. RHE with a small Tafel slope of ∼41 mV dec−1 and high stability over ∼20 h in 0.1 M KOH solution. Besides, it was also perceived that, hydrothermally prepared S-doped rGO supported CoIn2S4 (CoIn2S4/S-rGO) nanocomposite could serve as a novel and potential electrocatalytic material for efficiently catalyzing the ORR and OER.985 Also, Jiang et al.986 prepared NiCo2S4via a solvothermal method and during electrocatalyst testing it exhibited a good OER with a low onset potential of 1.45 V and low Tafel slope of ∼64 mV dec−1. The enriched OER performance of NiCo2S4 initiated from its short diffusion path and fast transport for active species and a long-term stability for ∼30 h were observed. Similarly, under an O2 saturated alkaline environment (0.1 M KOH), a NiCo2S4/3D graphene foam yielded an outstanding ORR performance with a four-electron oxygen reduction transfer in the potential range of −0.45 to 0.65 V.987 In addition, in order to enhance electrocatalytic activity, NiCo2S4 was mixed with nitrogen and sulfur-functionalized multiple graphene aerogel (N,S-MGA) to construct NiCo2S4/N,S-MGA composites.988 A high cathodic current peak about ∼−0.407 V signified outstanding activity towards ORR due to the presence of heteroatoms of N and S in the architecture, which supported the O2 adsorption over the catalyst.
However, the OER performance of several metal sulfides is restricted by their slow kinetics which leads to the need for a high overpotential (above 1.23 V vs. RHE) to initiate the OER reaction. This is a complex, multi-step chemical reaction comprising the transfer of four electrons, which explains the slow kinetics of the reaction. An additional challenge related with the OER is that at a high overpotential the metal sulfide catalyst is often oxidized; i.e. an intense binding of oxygen to the metal surface. Hence, developing metal sulfides based OER catalysts with superior catalytic activity and long-term stability will be an important step towards producing hydrogen gas at a commercial level.
10.2 Photocatalytic dye degradation
Recently, environmental contamination caused by organic chemicals such as synthetic dyes in water has received increasing attention because of its potential hazard to public health4,989–991 and metal sulfide semiconductors have a potential role in the photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds. The progress of practical applications is limited by the band-gap of the photocatalysts; however some metal sulfides have a narrow band gap which can feasibly oxidize and reduce organic dyes for an efficient photocatalytic dye degradation system.935 A large number of reports have indicated the excellent adsorption capacity of metal sulfides, doped metal sulfides, and heterostructures for organic dye removal.992–998 For instance, owing to the electronic properties and catalytic edge sites of monolayer MoS2 it has drawn much attention as a promising photocatalyst in photodegradation of dyes.999–1001 Bi-dopants of anion N and cation Co with MoS2 for photocatalytic dye degradation was studied via DFT.931 The CuS nanostructure was used to degrade the Methylene Blue (MB) dye at 663 nm. From the degradation process it was perceived that the kinetics is relatively quicker for the cationic dye molecules such as MB, rhodamine B (RhB) and malachinte green (MG), rather neutral methyl red (MR) and anionic methyl orange (MO). Additionally, if the catalyst concentration is increased the photoreaction becomes more rapid.992 A Cu1.94S–rGO composite exhibited higher removal efficiencies of ∼90.8% and ∼79.4% for cationic dye crystal violet and anionic dye methyl orange, respectively, where the minimum additive of 0.55 mM hydrogen peroxide was used.1002 Bhar et al.1003 reported that the degradation of Rose Bengal (RB) using mesoporous FeS2 nanoparticles. The high surface area of ∼49.53 m2 g−1 improved the adsorption of dye over a catalyst which in turn enhanced the photocatalytic degradation reaction. Pourahmad et al.1004 reported the photocatalytic activity of both bare Ag2S and Ag2S attached to a mesoporous silica material MCM-41 against MB. As a result, the Ag2S nanoparticles incorporated in MCM-41 resulted in an average surface area of ∼700 m2 g−1, which efficiently enhanced the degradation efficiency to ∼94%.
Later, Luo et al.1005 prepared CdS and Ni-doped CdS hollow spheres via a simple template-free one-pot method. The hollow sphere shaped photocatalysts exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation, and 1.2 mol% of Ni-doped CdS hollow spheres were found to be highly efficient for organic pollutants RhB and phenol removal, which also provided improved stability. The unique hollow spheres feature may have favored the collection of exiting light and the doping of Ni2+ may assist in the generation of charge carriers and delay their recombination rate by acting as temporary trapping active sites of photoinduced electrons. Mondal et al.1006 prepared SnS2 nanoflakes with a highly porous nature. Due to the high porosity and large surface area, the SnS2 nanoflakes efficiently removed the Cr(IV) ions under visible light exposure. Similarly, a high rate of degradation of 250 mg L−1 of aqueous Cr(VI) was achieved within 90 min by Zhong et al.125 using carbon nanofiber/tin(IV) sulfide (CNF@SnS2) core/sheath fibers. The enhanced photocatalytic degradation activity of CNF@SnS2 was attributed to its low band gap of 2.34 eV. In addition, CNF@SnS2 displayed good photocatalytic stability and cyclic stability.
10.3 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into value added products such as hydrocarbon fuels via solar light is promising as a new alternative for a sustainable energy resource and reduces global warming.1007–1009 To date, a wealth of metal sulfide materials, as well as their hybrids and heterostructures, have been active photocatalysts for solar CO2 reduction with positive achievements. However, most of the examined metal oxide materials such as TiO2,1010,1011 ZnO,1012 are only active to UV light which limits their utilization for solar energy. Hence, these photocatalysts frequently exhibit low efficiency of CO2 photoreduction. In principle, the photogenerated charge carrier separation and the subsequent transfer of electrons into catalytically active sites are the important step for determining solar CO2 reduction efficiency. Therefore, it is a challenge to suppress the recombination of electron–hole pairs, but the narrow band gap of metal sulfides1013,1014 can potentially facilitate an enhanced CO2 reduction rate through co-catalysts, heterostructures934,1015 and doping.1016,1017 In this regard, Chen et al.1018 prepared Bi2S3–ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites via a hydrothermal method, where the amount of Bi2S3 was set at 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 3 wt%. Due to the thin nanosheet features of the materials, a narrow band gap and good optical absorption properties was achieved compared to the bare ZnIn2S4 nanosheets, and composites of 2 wt%Bi2S3–ZnIn2S4 nanosheets exhibited a high photocatalytic conversion efficiency of CO2 into methyl formate by methanol solution under 365 nm. Similarly, Jiao et al.1019 prepared defective one-unit-cell layers of ZnIn2S4 where the rich zinc vacancies on one-unit-cell ZnIn2S4 layers exhibited a carbon monoxide formation rate of ∼33.2 μmol g−1 h−1, which was ∼3.6 times greater than that of defectless (poor zinc vacancies) one-unit-cell ZnIn2S4 layers and a long-term stability of ∼24 h. The enhanced performance was attributed to the defects in ZnIn2S4 layers, which provide more active sites for enhanced photocatalytic activity. Wang et al.68 achieved a high photocatalytic CO generation rate of ∼3075 μmol h−1 g−1 for sandwich-like ZnIn2S4–In2O3 hierarchical tubular heterostructures. This enhanced performance was attributed to the 1D open architectures of ZnIn2S4 with double heterojunction shells and 2D ultrathin nanosheets features, which provide a high surface area for CO2 adsorption, highly exposed active sites as well as facilitating the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers. In addition, due to the heterostructure formation using boron carbon nitride (BCN) with CdS nanoparticles, Zhou et al.67 attained a high CO production rate of ∼250 μmol h−1 g−1, which was approximately ten times higher than bare BCN material using the reducing agent of triethanolamine (TEOA).
11. Conclusions and perspectives
11.1 Overall conclusions
To date, several hundreds of mono- or bi-metal sulfides have been prepared via both top- and bottom-up approaches. Notably, CVD, pulsed laser, sputtering, and plasma approaches display advantages when fabricating metal sulfides in monolayer form. The approaches of hydrothermal, solvothermal, precipitation, sulfidation, and template methods are leading processing methods in attaining a range of nano- and micro-structured metal sulfide materials. In addition, lithography, spray pyrolysis, electrodeposition and electrospinning are advantageous for fabricating metal sulfide electrodes. However, the application of combustion synthesis for the formation of metal sulfides is yet to be fully explored. By these controlled fabrication techniques, rational tuning of the chemical, physical, optical and nano- and micro-structural properties of metal sulfide nanocrystals have been achieved. As a result of controlled preparation, the prepared metal sulfides and their composites or hybrids have been examined for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting applications. Importantly, MoS2, WS2, VS2, and their composites or hybrids have focused on HER activity. Due to their monolayer nature, MoS2 and WS2 with highly exposed active sites have attracted attention. However, there are a number of other potential materials such as Fe2S, SnS, CoS, Re2S, and Ta2S that remain to be fully explored. CdMnS, ZnMnS, MoWS, NiWS and their composites remain immature in terms of examination of properties and are worthy of future study.
Compared with metal oxides, the band gaps and energy levels of metal sulfides are more suitable for solar energy harvesting applications. Owing to their structural and electronic similarities to MoS2, WS2 has received intensive investigation as photoelectrochemical catalysts. However, most of the metal sulfides use a co-catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen generation and most of the mono-metal sulfides and bi-metal sulfides possess inferior photocatalytic H2 generation performance, since several metal sulfide materials suffer from photodegradation, which limits their long-term operational durability. In addition, to enhance the performance without structural or sulfur deficiencies, it is important to use sacrificial agents to improve performance. However, enhanced photocatalytic performance can be achieved by creating heterojunctions, doping with anions or cations or with carbon materials to expose more active sites, preventing agglomeration and amalgamation, and electronic structure modification of nanoparticles.
Remarkably, PEC water splitting of metal sulfide materials has received less attention. However, the PEC performance of these materials is in need of improvement and the use of edge sites, defect engineering, carbon heterostructures and processing temperature optimization need to fully exploited to improve final device PEC performance. Furthermore, as shown in Scheme 3, metal sulfides are prominently considered to enhance the performance of ORR/OER, photocatalytic dye degradation and photocatalytic CO2 reduction.
11.2 Fundamental scientific challenges and future perspective
The strategies to synthesize a variety of metal sulfide structures have been considered by developing an understanding the formation mechanism and production of the degree of charge carriers for effective electrocatalysis and photocatalysis application. Whilst achievements have been made over the past decades in the design and synthesis of metal sulfide related catalysts and photocatalysts for an enriched water splitting reaction, only limited amounts of H2 have been generated to date by electrocatalytic methods (i.e. few hundreds of micro-liters (μL) to few tens of milli-liters (mL) per gram of catalysts) using metal sulfide systems. There is a need to increase the H2 production rate to a few hundreds of milli-liters (mL), or greater. Similarly, for PEC water splitting a solar to hydrogen efficiency of only ∼12% has been achieved. Such production rates and efficiencies are inadequate for commercial application of metal sulfide systems. The following aspects need to be considered to develop disruptive metal sulfides for the energy sector and chemical industry (see Scheme 4).
 Scheme 4  Future perspectives on metal sulfide materials to enhance energy conversion and storage performance. 
(i) Most of the metal sulfides for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications are still at an early stage. The most studied metal sulfides for HER are MoS2 and WS2 with a limited number of photocatalytic applications for materials such as ZnIn2S4, and CdIn2S4. Thus, for future development, other metal sulfides including Sb, Sn, Mn, Re, V, Ni, Cu, Nb, and Ta metal based mono- and bi-metal or multi-metal sulfides with precisely defined shapes, sizes and compositions deserve future study.
(ii) There is a need to realize new metal sulfides using new strategies, such as using graphene, a carbon based matrix, selective doping, processing temperature control, nanostructural tuning, defect engineering and enhanced porosity and conductivity. Such future research paths can widen the metal sulfide family for both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications.
(iii) A challenge for photocatalysis is the inadequate potential energy of charges to drive the chemical reaction, which can be resolved by the creation of Z-scheme metal sulfides. The Z-scheme allows a controlled combination of electrons and holes from different materials by electron mediators such as rGO, Fe3+/Fe2+, Au, Ag, and IO3−/I−.
(iv) An alternative approach is to increase the activity of metal sulfide electrocatalysts and photocatalysts by decoration with single atom catalysis such as Pt, Au and Ru. Single atoms could be loaded on the monolayer of the metal sulfides or they can be loaded on the inner or outer areas of nanoboxes, hollow shells and nanobubbles of metal sulfides, which can offer outstanding performance such as activity, trapping of charge, surface reaction and comprehensive atomic utilization. Usually, the electro- or photo-catalyst used in single-atom catalysis is a supported metal catalyst that comprises only isolated single metal atoms as the major active centers. The single atomic decoration mechanism for the formation of metal sulfides and the time-resolved progression of charge transport during catalytic and photocatalytic reactions should be further examined with the aid of kinetics experiment and DFT.
(v) The decoration or hybridization of metal sulfides with metal organic frameworks (MOF's) is a potential strategy to increase the performance of any metal sulfide systems. This kind of structure can be made by introducing one or more different metal sulfide based co-templates into a MOF system. Such elegantly designed hybrid and/or decorated structures with novel morphologies and precise composition are fairly promising for emergent energy conversion processes.
(vi) Among the 2D and 2D related materials, the manufacture of metal sulfides of mono-layered MoS2 and WS2 have reached a commercial scale, however, large scale production of other materials such as NiS, SnS, TaS, ZnIn2S4, and CdIn2S4 remains a challenge. Up scaling is likely to further develop the industrial application of metal sulfides as catalysts or co-catalysts for renewable energy and fossil fuels.
(vii) The chemical stability of metal sulfides under a wide range of pH is a technical challenge that needs to be addressed. While many metal sulfides perform well for reasonably short periods of time, they can be vulnerable to oxidation and the performance of the devices can deteriorate over time as a result of corrosion. The decoration of Pt, Au, Pd, Ru and/or carbon matrices could be an alternative approach to improve corrosion and oxidation resistance. It has been established that metal sulfides are unstable during electrocatalytic reactions and transformed to consistent metal oxides, which were responsible for their catalytic activity. Hence, after catalytic reactions, the experimental analysis of metal sulfide catalysts to assess structural or compositional variations would be beneficial.
Based on the strategies mentioned above, it is also conceivable to develop metal sulfides for high performance overall water splitting systems (bifunctional activity i.e. HER with OER) with improved catalytic activity and long-term durability for industrial application.

 	Fig. 58  (a) Schematic electrochemical potentials of water oxidation and reduction, hydroxyl anion and ethanol oxidation follow Nernstian behaviour (slope −59 mV per pH), but the dependence of CdS conduction and valence bands on pH is only −33 mV per pH. Orange dots related to obtained conduction band minima of CdS. The green circle marks the region where valence band of EVB(CdS) is more positive than E°(OH/−OH); the violet arrows represent the chance of a two-step oxidation pathway reaction at high pH versus a single-step reaction at lower pH. (b) Comparison of H2 generation rates over 6 h displaying strong enhancement at high pH, (c) hydrogen evolution versus time under 477 nm laser light illumination for pH 12.0, 14.0 and 14.7, and (d) long-term hydrogen evolution versus illumination time with hole scavenger of 10% ethanol. The scale bars designate the apparent quantum yield (AQY) at 447 nm, be around 20 h of illumination (width of the bars represent the interval time).
