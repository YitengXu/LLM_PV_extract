    AbstractWhile titania nanotubes are expected to have important applications in the photoelectrochemical production of hydrogen, it is found that surface-adsorbed ions on the nanotube surface, specifically alkali ions, have a significant impact on the photoelectrochemical water-splitting characteristics. Such surface-adsorbed alkali ions are invariably a result of the electrochemical fabrication process which uses an alkali-based electrolyte for the production of vertically aligned array of titania nanotubes. The presence of surface-adsorbed ions is revealed in synchrotron-based near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) studies. Photoelectrochemical behavior of such surface-adsorbed titania nanotubes is found to be significantly altered when compared with pure titania nanotubes which may be explained in terms of a simple phenomenological model predicting modifications to the energy band structure of titania as a result of surface adsorption.

Broader context
Titania nanotubes, fabricated by means of electrochemical anodization in standard alkali-containing electrolytes, contain a significant amount of surface-adsorbed alkali ions that impact the titania water splitting (photoelectrochemical) properties. Specifically, we have shown by synchrotron-based near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy that there is adsorbed potassium on the titania nanotube surface. To date the presence of such alkali atoms has escaped detection, likely due to the application of less sensitive techniques of smaller cross section, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We further demonstrate that titania nanotubes containing adsorbed potassium modify the photoelectrochemical performance when compared to that of pure titania nanotubes. This conclusion is supported by measurements of the external bias needed to produce hydrogen at an optimal efficiency. Specifically, it is demonstrated that potassium-modified titania nanotubes require lower electrical energy input in comparison with potassium-free nanotubes to produce the same amount of hydrogen. This significant result strongly suggests that tailoring the alkali content may be an efficient means to fine-tune the response of titania-based photoelectrochemical electrodes.

Introduction
The direct synthesis of hydrogen from water and solar energy using titania as photocatalyst was first demonstrated by Fujishima & Honda in 1976.1–3 In recent years it has been shown that the superior surface area-to-volume ratio of titania nanotubes increases both their photo-absorption capability and their overall catalytic efficiency.4,5 Following the lead of Fujishima & Honda the most typical electrolytes used to date in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells for splitting of water are basic solutions of either potassium hydroxide (KOH) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH).2–6 These choices are due to the fact that the absolute energy level of the titania conduction and valence bands shifts to more negative values in more basic electrolytes.7 This shift increases titania's ability to donate photo-excited electrons towards the reduction of protons and subsequent evolution of H2. As a result it is typically more efficient to split water with a higher, rather than a lower, pH when using TiO2 as the photoanode.
Our recent experiments on the photocatalytic properties of titania nanotubes suggest that the K+ and Na+ ions present in most water-splitting electrolytes are more than just inert cations and in fact alter the photocatalytic performance of the photoanode. It is hypothesized that the absorption of K+ ions into the titania nanotube structure reduces the external bias needed for the photocatalysts to produce hydrogen at an optimal efficiency. Hence, the K+ content can conceivably be used as a tool to fine-tune the response of TiO2-based PEC electrodes. In addition, on the basis of a simple phenomenological model, it can be shown that surface-adsorbed potassium shifts the absolute energy levels of the TiO2 energy bands to more negative values and therefore mimics the beneficial effect that high electrolyte pH has on the light-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency. This hypothesis on the role of K+ and Na+ on the PEC activity of titania nanotubes are strongly supported by near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra. NEXAFS results indicate that potassium ions are stably surface adsorbed on all nanotube samples that have been in contact with potassium-containing electrolytes. Several studies in the literature suggest that both K and Na form strong ionic bonds with TiO2, inducing significant charge transfer and altering the surface electronic and band structure.8–15 It is therefore natural to expect that the presence of these cations will impact both the surface chemistry and photochemistry of affected TiO2 catalysts.
Experimental details
All of our experiments have been carried out on high aspect ratio titania nanotubes fabricated by anodizing titanium foil (Alfa Aesar, 99.5%, 0.25 mm thick) in a standard two-electrode electrochemical cell with a platinum counter-electrode, as reported elsewhere.16,17 The electrolytes used contained either K+, Na+, or NH4+ salts in addition to hydrofluoric, oxalic and/or trichloro-acetic acids (see Table 1). Anodization of titanium foil in fluorine-containing electrolytes results in the formation of amorphous titania nanotube arrays as shown in Fig. 1 and 2. In order to induce crystallinity, the samples were annealed at 400 °C in oxygen for 2 h, with heating and cooling rates of 1 °C min−1.18,19 Upon annealing the nanotubes are converted to polycrystalline anatase,16,18–20 as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD).

The electronic structure of the conduction band of the materials was characterized with NEXAFS spectra obtained at beamline U7A at the National Synchrotron Light Source at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The photocurrent and photoelectrochemical efficiencies of the samples were measured in a custom-made photo-electrochemical cell with a platinum counter electrode (area 4 cm2, spaced 3 cm from the sample/photoanode location), an external Ag/AgCl reference electrode with a Luggin-Haber capillary and a quartz window. The electrolyte in the water-splitting cell consisted of a 0.05 M solution of Ba(OH)2 with pH = 12.64. After 10 h of operation there was no measurable change in pH suggesting that stoichiometric water-splitting was the only significant reaction in the cell. A 150 W xenon lamp with an intensity of 980 (±20) W m−2 was employed as the light source. The spectrum and intensity of the light source were recorded using an Ocean Optics HR4000-UV-NIR spectrophotometer equipped with a cosine irradiance probe. The distance between the lamp and the sample was adjusted to achieve an absolute irradiance similar to that of AM 1.5 solar radiation. (The irradiation used was measured to be 980 (±20) W m−2). The photocurrent and the applied electrode bias were measured using a CHI Industries 600 C potentiostat. The reported photocurrent and efficiency values were measured by keeping the voltage (applied bias) constant until the photocurrent reached a steady value. The voltage differential across the potentiostat was measured independently using an additional voltmeter (Keithley Instruments Model 181).
The conditions used to fabricate the nanotube samples are given in Table 1. The primary synthesis goal was to vary the K+ and Na+ cation concentrations used in the anodization electrolyte while keeping all other fabrication parameters the same so that the nanotubes had nominally identical physical morphologies but different levels of alkali content. The samples labeled NH1 had no K- or Na-salts added during fabrication. The samples labeled K2 had approximately 92% of the K+ concentration (assuming the complete dissociation of KOH) with respect to the K1 batch, whereas the samples labeled K3 had only 20% of the K+ ion concentration with respect to the K1 batch.
As can be seen from Table 2 and Fig. 1 and 2, the morphology of the nanotube samples obtained from the different batches do not differ significantly. This similarity arises as the parameters identified as critical for determining nanotube morphology, namely fluorine concentration, acidity (pH), anodization voltage, anodization time and bath temperature,18,21,22 were kept constant in the current study.

Results and discussion
The NEXAFS spectra of all nanotube samples fabricated in electrolytes containing potassium displayed distinct potassium peaks around 297.6 and 300.2 eV (Fig. 3 and 4). The peaks are unequivocally assigned to transitions to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals, respectively, of the K L-edge. Note that unlike the other carbon-based features in these spectra at 285–310 eV, the potassium peaks do not show any decay upon annealing the nanotubes. Hence, the adsorbed potassium on the surface appears to be stable with a high energy of desorption. These peaks are shifted to higher energies compared to typical L-edge values (∼294.6 eV & 297.3 eV), such as those reported by Nelson et al.23 or tabulated by Henke et al.24 This shift of ∼3 eV is similar to that observed by Schmidt et al.11 who interpreted the shift as a signature of strongly ionic K bonds with organic molecules in their soil samples. Less sensitive techniques, such as energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), have to date failed to detect what appears to be this sub-monolayer coverage of alkali metals on titania nanotubes.25–27 The NEXAFS potassium peak intensity is also seen to be a function of TiO2 nanotube synthesis voltage as shown in Fig. 4. The potassium peaks are of weaker intensity for the sample fabricated at a higher anodization voltage, implying that a larger electrode bias fosters a lower K+ concentration in the product. This result is consistent with the reports by Wood et al.28 who measured the mobility of cations and anions in aluminium oxide films under varied anodic biases. This study confirmed that a higher positive bias increases the rate at which cationic species diffuse outward and eventually are ejected from the oxide layer.

Resonances attributable to carbon K edges features are labeled.11,36,37 (i.e. these peaks could be assigned to transitions from C 1s orbitals to orbitals of the type indicated. Note that the two sharp peaks may contain contributions from several resonances and that there is a stretch of broad carbon σ* features from 290 eV upwards.) The two additional peaks are the potassium resonances described in the text. The fabrication conditions for the nanotubes whose spectra are shown here are: Top—0.4 M oxalic acid, 0.25 M KF, 0.06 M KOH, anodized at 10 V for 20 min. Bottom—exactly the same with an additional 0.13 M HCl added to the electrolyte. 
 Fig. 4  The NEXAFS carbon K-edge spectra of two titania nanotube samples. All fabrication conditions for these spectra except for anodization voltages were identical to that of the sample labeled “K 10V An” in Fig. 1. The spectrum labeled “18V” was anodized at 18 V as opposed to 10 V. 
Several recent theoretical and experimental studies have proposed and explored the possibility of charge transfer between adsorbed K atoms and the titanium dioxide substrate.8–10,14,29 This proposed charge transfer is anticipated to have a significant impact not only on the potassium electron binding energies but also on properties such as the titania surface charge and the energy band character (band bending). Significant adjustments in surface charge would naturally impact the surface electrochemistry and changes in band bending would affect charge separation dynamics.
The average open circuit (VOC) and also the average short circuit (VCC) voltages of all samples fabricated are shown in Chart 1. The open circuit voltages of all samples fabricated in K+- or Na+-containing electrolytes were consistently more negative (ΔE = 0.08–0.13 V, estimated error ∼0.01 V) than in samples fabricated without these alkali salts. With the circuit closed, the gap between alkali-contaminated electrodes and alkali-free electrodes was reduced to 0.02–0.06 V. However, K+- or Na+-containing electrodes were still consistently more negative than the alkali-metal-free samples. Samples fabricated in the most K+- or Na+-rich electrolytes (K1 & Na1) also possessed the most negative VOC and VCC potentials.
 Chart 1  The average open circuit (VOC) and short circuit (VCC) voltages of the titania nanotube samples measured against a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The measurements were made under the same 982 W m−2 simulated solar light that was used in the measurements of Fig. 5 and Chart 2. 
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting performance of all samples is summarized in Chart 2. To illustrate these data, the detailed photocurrent and efficiency measurements for three individual samples are given in Fig. 5. Starting at the illuminated open circuit voltage of each sample, the working electrode (TiO2 nanotube sample) potential was incrementally raised and was held at a specific potential until the photocurrent and applied bias, measured independently by a second voltmeter, reached a steady value. As can be seen in Fig. 5(a), the photocurrent (Iph) and applied bias voltage (Vbias) both increase as the working electrode becomes more positive. The conversion efficiency, ηc, a metric that quantifies the percentage of light energy converted into chemical energy by a given sample at a given bias voltage, is calculated by using the following formula:7,30 (Eq. 1)where ΔGr×n is the Gibbs free energy per coulomb of electrons for the water splitting reaction (1.23 V), I0 the irradiance (W m−2) and A the irradiated area (m2). Hence, as is evident from Fig. 5(b), there is a trade-off between the benefit of increased photocurrent and the detriment of increased applied bias. This trade-off leads to a maximum in efficiency at electrode potentials ≈ +0.1 V with respect to the closed circuit voltage of any given sample. A comparison of the average maximum efficiency values of the nanotube samples is provided in Chart 2. From this data it is clear that sodium ions are detrimental to the PEC performance of titania nanotube photoanodes, irrespective of concentration during fabrication. On the other hand, potassium-containing and alkali-free samples achieved comparable efficiencies. (The observation that batch K2 performed slightly worse than batches NH1, K1 & K3 is attributed to the fact that it had less fluorine (Table 1)). However, despite similar maximum efficiencies, there is a distinct difference in ‘how’ these efficiencies exhibited by K+-containing and K+-free samples are achieved. This conclusion is evidenced by a comparison of the photocurrent at maximum efficiency and the fraction of that photocurrent attributable to light energy, Chart 2. The K+-free samples achieved maximum efficiency at larger photocurrents driven by larger bias voltages while the K+-containing samples consistently required a lower bias voltage to achieve optimal efficiency. At optimal efficiency, the K+-containing samples produced hydrogen at a lower rate but required a significantly lower external energy input per litre of hydrogen produced.
 Fig. 5  The photocurrent (a) and efficiency (b) of individual TiO2 nanotube samples under 982 W m−2 full spectrum (over all wavelengths of the simulated solar radiation). The data for the samples shown are representative of samples fabricated under the conditions labeled NH1, K2 and Na1 (see Table 1). The average maximum efficiencies, and photocurrents at maximum efficiency for samples fabricated under each set of conditions are given in Chart 2. The efficiency is calculated by the formula given in the text. Since the samples are undoped, they absorb only photons with energies above the natural anatase bandgap of 3.2 eV (or λ < 388 nm). The efficiency given here is a measure of the percent of UV light (λ < 400 nm) converted to hydrogen by the water-splitting reaction. That is, the value used for I0 was 46.2 W m−2, which is the measured intensity of light incident on the sample with λ < 400 nm. (For a full spectrum efficiency, simply multiply the reported efficiency by 46.4/982). 
 Chart 2  The maximum UV to hydrogen conversion efficiencies of the titania nanotube samples fabricated under the conditions given in Table 1 (the values given are batch averages). The efficiency was calculated as in fig. 5. Also given is the average photocurrent at the electrode potential/bias where efficiency was maximum. Finally, the percentage of chemical energy that is derived from light energy when the given set of electrodes operate at maximum efficiency is given. (The residual of the energy is supplied by the external bias/potentiostat. The formula used is:  and ΔG = 1.23 V). 
Several theoretical and experimental studies suggest that K+ ions adsorbed onto TiO2 surfaces foster a significant electron transfer to the semiconductor, presumably from the K-3s orbitals to Ti-3d states (see, for instance, Muscat et al.9). The studies of Casanova et al. employing photoemission and spectroscopy studies8 and of Courcot et al.14 based on X-ray spectroscopy and the vibrating condenser method indicate that potassium adsorption lowers the work function of TiO2 and makes the surface potential (χ) more positive. Casanova et al.8 also showed that K+ adsorption in vacuo causes TiO2 energy bands to bend downward towards lower electron energies at the surface. On the other hand, the results of Chart 1 indicate a significant negative shift in both the open and closed circuit voltages of titania nanotube samples with potassium adsorption.
A hypothesis concerning the TiO2 nanotube band structure that reconciles all these observations is illustrated in Fig. 6. Fig. 6(a) displays the normal band edge energy diagram of an n-type semiconductor immersed in an aqueous electrolyte while Fig. 6(b) & 6(c) schematically illustrate proposed modifications to the TiO2 nanotube band structure upon potassium adsorption. These modifications are (i) energy bands of K-containing titania nanotubes are pinned at an energy level that is slightly more positive than that of K-free titania nanotube samples and (ii) the band bending becomes less steep as potassium is adsorbed on the surface. Modification (i) has been revealed by the χ measurements of Courcot et al.14 and (ii) has been reported in studies8,10 in which they deposited atomic K onto a rutile surface in a vacuum. Their measurements suggest that K atoms adsorbed onto the rutile surface donate electrons from the 3s orbital to Ti-3d “bandgap states”. These experimental findings were subsequently supported by the computational study of Muscat et al.9 Casanova et al. also observed that the TiO2 energy band edges bend downward towards the surface after K adsorption, a result attributed to positively-charged K surface cations and electron transfer from those cations to the bulk. As our study focuses on electrochemical measurements from TiO2 nanotube samples in solution, expected n-type charge transfer from our samples to the solution causes the usual upward band bending towards the surface as shown in Fig. 6(a). This conclusion is in contrast to the downward bending seen in vacuum by Casanova et al.8 However, the surface-adsorbed potassium is anticipated to pin the TiO2 energy bands at slightly more positive values (hypothesis (i)). Since surface-adsorbed K+ species act as counter-ions to negative electrolyte species as well as electron donors in close vicinity to the space charge layer, the effect should be a reduction of the slope of downward band bending.
 Fig. 6  A schematic of the proposed energy band model. The following features that are consistent with experimental observation are labeled: (i) surface potential (and band pinning) become more positive (upon K+ adsorption)—Courcot et al.,14 (ii) band bending becomes ‘less steep upward’ towards the surface—Casanova et al.,8 (iii) illuminated electrode potentials become more negative—Chart 1 and (iv) the applied voltage needed to obtain optimal overpotential (η) is reduced—Chart 2. 

Fig. 6(c) shows how this model predicts the results observed in this study: a higher electrode potential in K-enriched samples under illumination as well as a reduction in the external bias required to achieve the ‘optimal’ overpotential (η) at the cathode where H2 is evolved. This phenomenological explanation also accounts for the observed reduced photocurrent since it predicts a reduction in the space charge layer field strength that underlies efficient electron-hole charge separation. In addition to fostering increased recombination, the presence of K ions adsorbed onto the surface of TiO2 nanotubes may act as charge trapping sites and influence electrode kinetics through electrode blocking and double layer effects.31,32
The incorporation of alkali ions on the surface of titania nanotubes appears to clearly have a measurable impact on its photocatalytic properties. Indeed, from our results, the potassium content of titania nanotube anodes for hydrogen solar cells may be used as a control variable to optimize the trade-off between high photocurrent (high H2 output) and low external voltage input per litre of H2 produced, albeit at a lower rate. Currently, it is not clear what outcome is more desirable; considerable effort has been invested into designing PEC cells that need no external energy input,33,34 as well as into research on materials such as SrTiO3 with bandgaps that can split water unassisted with an external applied bias.35 However, as long as the need for some photovoltaic or grid-supplied electricity cannot be eliminated altogether, an optimal solution will have to take into account both fixed costs (solar cell materials and land area) and running costs (power input).

Broader context
Titania nanotubes, fabricated by means of electrochemical anodization in standard alkali-containing electrolytes, contain a significant amount of surface-adsorbed alkali ions that impact the titania water splitting (photoelectrochemical) properties. Specifically, we have shown by synchrotron-based near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy that there is adsorbed potassium on the titania nanotube surface. To date the presence of such alkali atoms has escaped detection, likely due to the application of less sensitive techniques of smaller cross section, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We further demonstrate that titania nanotubes containing adsorbed potassium modify the photoelectrochemical performance when compared to that of pure titania nanotubes. This conclusion is supported by measurements of the external bias needed to produce hydrogen at an optimal efficiency. Specifically, it is demonstrated that potassium-modified titania nanotubes require lower electrical energy input in comparison with potassium-free nanotubes to produce the same amount of hydrogen. This significant result strongly suggests that tailoring the alkali content may be an efficient means to fine-tune the response of titania-based photoelectrochemical electrodes.

(a) & (b) is a sample made in a K & Na free electrolyte and (c) & (d) is made in a K containing electrolyte (shown at increased magnification). (a) & (c) are before annealing and (b) & (d) are post annealing. Upon annealing, the crystal structure turns from amorphous to polycrystalline anatase. The nanotube structure remains intact up to temperatures of 500–600 °C.

 	Fig. 3  The NEXAFS carbon K-edge spectra of titania nanotube samples fabricated using organic acids and potassium salts taken prior to annealing (at 400 °C in O2) and post annealing. Resonances attributable to carbon K edges features are labeled.11,36,37 (i.e. these peaks could be assigned to transitions from C 1s orbitals to orbitals of the type indicated. Note that the two sharp peaks may contain contributions from several resonances and that there is a stretch of broad carbon σ* features from 290 eV upwards.) The two additional peaks are the potassium resonances described in the text. The fabrication conditions for the nanotubes whose spectra are shown here are: Top—0.4 M oxalic acid, 0.25 M KF, 0.06 M KOH, anodized at 10 V for 20 min. Bottom—exactly the same with an additional 0.13 M HCl added to the electrolyte.	 

 	Fig. 4  The NEXAFS carbon K-edge spectra of two titania nanotube samples. All fabrication conditions for these spectra except for anodization voltages were identical to that of the sample labeled “K 10V An” in Fig. 1. The spectrum labeled “18V” was anodized at 18 V as opposed to 10 V.	 

 	Chart 1  The average open circuit (VOC) and short circuit (VCC) voltages of the titania nanotube samples measured against a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The measurements were made under the same 982 W m−2 simulated solar light that was used in the measurements of Fig. 5 and Chart 2.	 
	(Eq. 1)

 	Fig. 5  The photocurrent (a) and efficiency (b) of individual TiO2 nanotube samples under 982 W m−2 full spectrum (over all wavelengths of the simulated solar radiation). The data for the samples shown are representative of samples fabricated under the conditions labeled NH1, K2 and Na1 (see Table 1). The average maximum efficiencies, and photocurrents at maximum efficiency for samples fabricated under each set of conditions are given in Chart 2. The efficiency is calculated by the formula given in the text. Since the samples are undoped, they absorb only photons with energies above the natural anatase bandgap of 3.2 eV (or λ < 388 nm). The efficiency given here is a measure of the percent of UV light (λ < 400 nm) converted to hydrogen by the water-splitting reaction. That is, the value used for I0 was 46.2 W m−2, which is the measured intensity of light incident on the sample with λ < 400 nm. (For a full spectrum efficiency, simply multiply the reported efficiency by 46.4/982).	 

 	Chart 2  The maximum UV to hydrogen conversion efficiencies of the titania nanotube samples fabricated under the conditions given in Table 1 (the values given are batch averages). The efficiency was calculated as in fig. 5. Also given is the average photocurrent at the electrode potential/bias where efficiency was maximum. Finally, the percentage of chemical energy that is derived from light energy when the given set of electrodes operate at maximum efficiency is given. (The residual of the energy is supplied by the external bias/potentiostat. The formula used is:  and ΔG = 1.23 V).	 

 	Fig. 6  A schematic of the proposed energy band model. The following features that are consistent with experimental observation are labeled: (i) surface potential (and band pinning) become more positive (upon K+ adsorption)—Courcot et al.,14 (ii) band bending becomes ‘less steep upward’ towards the surface—Casanova et al.,8 (iii) illuminated electrode potentials become more negative—Chart 1 and (iv) the applied voltage needed to obtain optimal overpotential (η) is reduced—Chart 2.
