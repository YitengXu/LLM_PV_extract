    , Accepted 2nd May 2015First published on 6th May 2015AbstractA systematic calculation, using hybrid density functional theory, has been carried out to investigate the origin of the enhancement of photo-conversion efficiency of Rh-doped SrTiO3 with codoping of Sb. In the case of Rh-doped SrTiO3, partially unoccupied states are introduced above the valence band, thus lowering the hole oxidation at the valence band (VB) drastically, which explains the poor oxygen evolution activity of Rh-doped SrTiO3. We show that the partially occupied t2g subset of the Rh 4d orbital is completely filled in the presence of Sb due to the transfer of the extra electron to the Rh center. As a result, acceptor states are completely passivated in the case of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 and a continuous band structure with reduced band gap is formed, which is responsible for the observed enhanced photocatalytic activity of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3. We have shown that the relative positions of the band edges of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 with respect to the water redox levels are in favor of the spontaneous release of both hydrogen and oxygen during water splitting, which is consistent with the experimental observation. We have also studied the effect of codoping in different proportions (1:2 and 2:1) of Rh and Sb. Although 1:2 (Rh, Sb)-codoping leads to the formation of a clean band structure with the reduction of the band gap by a larger extent, it shows lower photo-conversion efficiency due to its charge non-compensated nature. In addition, the presence of acceptor states above the VB limits the oxygen evolution efficiency of 2:1 (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3. Thus, the present approach successfully reproduces the experimental features of the Rh-monodoped as well as (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 and also explains their origin.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting has attracted immense interest for the generation of hydrogen, which is one of the potential alternate sources of energy.1–3 Over the decades, numerous studies have been carried out to find a suitable photocatalyst for this purpose.4–9 SrTiO3 is found to be one of the popular photocatalysts for water splitting as well as for the degradation of environmental pollutants due to its high reducing and oxidizing power, non-toxicity, and sufficient stability. This material, however, due to its relatively large band gap (3.2 eV) shows poor photoactivity in the visible region, which is approximately 55% of the solar spectrum.10 One of most successful methods to reduce the band gap involves doping with metal or non-metal species. However, band gap narrowing should be done in a controlled way, so that the modified material satisfies the thermodynamic criteria for both the half reactions of water splitting (H+ + e− → 1/2H2 and H2O → 1/2O2 + 2H+ + 2e−) to occur spontaneously. To be an active material for hydrogen evolution, the conduction band minima (CBM) potential of the material should be more negative than the water reduction potential (H+/H2). In addition, for spontaneous oxygen release, the material should have a more positive valence band maxima (VBM) potential than the water oxidation potential (H2O/O2). Significant enhancement in the visible light activity of SrTiO3 has been achieved by N-doping, which is attributed to the introduction of N 2p acceptor states above the valence band (VB), thus reducing the band gap significantly.11,12 Since these acceptor states reduce the mobility of charge carriers and serve as electron–hole recombination centers, the photocatalytic activity of N-doped SrTiO3 is found to be lower than expected.13,14 The effect of doping with various transition metal elements has also been investigated to improve the visible light activity of SrTiO3.15–18 Although the effective band gap is reduced due to localized d-states of the dopant element, the photo-conversion efficiency decreases drastically. In order to passivate the local charge carrier trapping centers, the strategy of codoping with another element has been widely adopted in the technology of band gap engineering. This may involve dopants consisting of either cation–cation pairs, cation–anion pairs, or anion–anion pairs.19–29 However, a proper choice of dopant pair is very crucial to achieve high photocatalytic activity along with enhanced visible light activity.
In the present study, we investigate the recent observation of enhanced photo-conversion efficiency of Rh-doped SrTiO3 with addition of Sb.30–32 Owing to good visible light activity, Rh-doped SrTiO3 has been paid significant attention by several groups.33–42 It shows relatively higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation compared to (Mn/Ru/Ir/Pt/Pd)-doped SrTiO3.16,17 Various attempts have been made to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of Rh-doped SrTiO3 to a further extent. As an example, Iwashina et al. found a significant increase of photocurrent as well as rate of water splitting when Rh-doped SrTiO3 was pasted on an electrode with respect to that in powdered form.33 Shen et al. adopted the polymerizable complex method for the preparation of Rh-doped SrTiO3 and observed better photocatalytic activity than that prepared using conventional route.34 Furthermore, Kawasaki et al. found that the photocatalytic performance of Rh-doped SrTiO3 is significantly higher when Rh exists in the +3 state than in the +4 state.38,39 It has been revealed that the Rh4+ state introduces localized acceptor states between the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB). Since these states are very efficient in trapping the charge carriers and promoting their recombination, the photo-conversion efficiency achieved is relatively lower. Moreover, in the presence of the Rh3+ state, acceptor states are found to disappear, consequently reducing the rate of charge carrier loss. Thus, the oxidation state of Rh should be +3 for achieving a high photocatalytic activity of Rh-doped SrTiO3. However, the challenge is to fix the oxidation state of Rh to +3 as both Rh3+ and Rh4+ states have been found to be present in the Rh-doped SrTiO3 samples prepared normally. Codoping with Sb has been shown to be one of the successful approaches for the stabilization of the Rh3+ state in the Rh-doped SrTiO3 system and has been explained in terms of the formation of a charge compensated system in the presence of Sb5+ with Rh3+.30–32 Thus, the formation of the Rh4+ state is suppressed, leading to an increased lifetime of the photo-generated charge carriers; hence, the photocatalytic activity is increased to a significant extent. However, a detailed description of the change in electronic structure of Rh-doped SrTiO3 in the presence of Sb has yet to be explored. In the present study, we have investigated the origin of the acceptor states in the case of Rh-doped SrTiO3 in detail, thus attempting to determine how they are passivated in the presence of Sb. A systematic quantum chemical calculation using density functional theory (DFT) has been presented, which describes the effect of individual as well as both the dopant elements on the electronic structure of SrTiO3. As we know that standard DFT calculation underestimates the band gap with respect to the actual value, we have employed hybrid DFT although it is computationally expensive. Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional,43 which has been shown to be successful in reproducing the experimental band gap of SrTiO3, has been adopted for the electronic structure calculations in the present study.
The paper is organized by first presenting the computational methodology (Section 2), then describing the results on geometry, electronic structure, defect pair binding energy, formation energy, optical property and band edge alignment (Section 3) and finally making concluding remarks (Section 4).
2. Computational details
All the first principle calculations are carried out using DFT by employing the Vienna ab initio simulation (VASP) package.44 To model the doped systems, we consider a 2 × 2 × 3 supercell (60 atoms) of the cubic SrTiO3 crystal structure. All the model structures have been fully relaxed (both ionic positions as well as cell parameters) using a conjugate gradient algorithm with k-point mesh of 6 × 6 × 4 generated using the Monkhorst and Pack scheme45 and energy convergence of 10−6 eV. For geometry optimization, the exchange and correlation potentials have been defined by a Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA).46 The projector augmented wave (PAW) potential represents the interactions between ionic core and valence electrons.47 To construct the potential, we have considered the valence states: Sr (4s24p65s2), Ti (4s23d2), Rh (5s14d8), Sb (5s25p3), and O (2s22p4). An energy cutoff of 600 eV is chosen for the expansion of the valence electron orbital in the plane wave basis set. Electronic structure calculations have been carried out using the HSE hybrid functional, wherein the exchange functionals corresponding to the short range (SR) and long range (LR) contributions are treated separately. The short range part is described by mixing the exact Hartree–Fock exchange and PBE exchange, while the long range part is calculated through the PBE functional only. The general form for the exchange–correlation energy (EHSEXC) is given by43 EHSEXC = αESRX(μ) + (1 − α)EPBE,SRX(μ) + EPBE,LRX(μ) + EPBEC(1)where ‘α’ is the mixing coefficient and ‘μ’ is the screening parameter. As in our earlier studies, we have considered 28% mixing for the exchange and the standard value (0.2 Å−1) for the screening parameter, which is found to lead to a calculated band gap for SrTiO3 very close to the experimental value.22,23 For the density of states (DOS) calculation, Brillouin-zone integrations were done by employing the tetrahedron method with a Blöchl correction.48
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Geometry and electronic structure
The most common crystal structure of SrTiO3 is cubic with space group Pmm (No. 221), wherein strontium and titanium are coordinated with 12 and 6 oxygen anions, respectively. The structural framework is based on corner-sharing TiO6 perfect octahedra with the Sr ion occupying the center position. The unit cell of SrTiO3 contains one strontium, one titanium and three oxygen atoms. A 2 × 2 × 3 supercell structure of SrTiO3 is shown in Fig. 1. The calculated supercell dimensions are found to be 7.897 Å (in the X and Y direction) and 11.846 Å (in the Z direction). The calculated band gap (3.19 eV) of SrTiO3 matches well with the experimentally reported value (3.2 eV).10 The density of states (DOS) plot is displayed in Fig. 2a, which indicates that the VBM and CBM have mainly O 2p character and Ti 3d character, respectively. In the following subsections, we will first discuss the effect of the individual dopant elements (Rh and Sb), and then the combined effect of both.

Previous experimental studies have shown that Rh substitutes Ti4+ and occupies the octahedral lattice sites in the SrTiO3 crystal structure. Hence, we model Rh-doped SrTiO3 by replacing one of the Ti atoms in the 2 × 2 × 3 supercell by Rh (dopant concentration corresponds to 8.33%). Full geometric relaxation indicates that the deviation from ideal structure is very small (cell dimensions increase by 0.002 Å in the X/Y direction, and 0.005 Å in the Z direction), which is due to the closeness of ionic radii of Ti4+ (RTi4+ = 0.605 Å) and Rh4+ (RRh4+ = 0.60 Å).49 This is consistent with the observation of a single phase XRD pattern of Rh-doped SrTiO3 similar to that from an undoped SrTiO3 crystal structure.39 However, the presence of Rh brings significant changes in the electronic structure of SrTiO3. As can be seen from the DOS plot (Fig. 3a), the impurity states appear as partially unoccupied states above the VB, and are contributed by O 2p and Rh 4d orbitals. This is due to strong hybridization between O 2p and Rh 4d states. The unsymmetrical nature of the spin-up and spin-down part of DOS is the consequence of unpaired electrons in the Rh-doped SrTiO3 system (Rh4+: 4d5). A more detailed description of the nature of the gap states is presented in Fig. 4a. In the octahedral crystal field, Rh 4d orbitals split into t2g subset and eg subset. Fig. 4a reveals that the t2g subset of orbitals contributes to these gap states. Thus, one can describe the electron distribution in the Rh 4d orbital as t52g e0g, i.e., a low spin configuration. This is supported by the calculated total magnetic moment value of 1.0 μB per supercell. The photoexcitation of electrons in the Rh-doped SrTiO3 occurs with light of even lower energy due to the presence of the mid gap states. This is in accord with the experimental observation of the significant enhancement of the visible light activity of SrTiO3 upon Rh doping. Unfortunately, these acceptor states provide an efficient source for charge carrier trapping centers and thus drastically reduce the mobility of the charge carriers. This causes the photo-conversion efficiency of Rh-doped SrTiO3 to be lower than expected. In addition, it may have a significant role in explaining the observation of poor oxygen evolution activity of Rh-doped SrTiO3.31,32 Hence, in order to improve the photocatalytic activity, these acceptor states must be passivated, which can be done by suppressing the formation of the Rh4+ state. The introduction of Sb has been reported to be successful in stabilizing the Rh3+ state, and increasing the lifetime of the photo-generated charge carriers.32 Herein, we want to investigate the role of Sb from the electronic structure point of view, which has not been discussed so far. We first consider the individual effect of Sb on the electronic structure of SrTiO3. Similar to the case of Rh, Sb also prefers to occupy the Ti lattice sites in the SrTiO3 crystal structure. To model Sb-doped SrTiO3, we replace one of the Ti from the 2 × 2 × 3 SrTiO3 supercell by Sb (dopant concentration corresponds to 8.33%). After full relaxation, it was observed that the change in geometrical structure due to Sb-doping is limited to the local region only (cell dimensions increase by 0.02 Å in the X/Y direction and 0.033 Å in the Z direction), which is consistent with the experimental observations.50 This is due to the similarity in ionic sizes of Ti4+ (RTi4+ = 0.605 Å) and Sb5+ (RSb5+ = 0.60 Å).49 The DOS plot (Fig. 3b) shows the introduction of partially occupied impurity states due to Sb doping adjacent to the CBM of SrTiO3. The Fermi level shifts near to the CB, indicating the presence of extra electrons. This is obvious because Sb (5s25p3), which is more stable in the +5 state, occupies the lattice site of Ti4+ and introduces one extra valence electron. As can be seen from Fig. 3b, the impurity states have mainly Ti 3d character, i.e., the extra electron is localized on the Ti center. The total magnetic moment of Sb-doped SrTiO3 is calculated to be −0.715 μB, which is mainly contributed by Ti, indicating the localization of the unpaired electron on the Ti center.

Furthermore, we will consider the scenario when both Rh and Sb dopants are present in SrTiO3. According to recent XRD analysis of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3, both Rh and Sb occupy Ti lattice sites, maintaining the basic crystal structure of the host.30 This also rules out the formation of any other defect states due to codoping with Rh and Sb. In this study, we model (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 by introducing one Rh and one Sb at Ti lattice sites in the 2 × 2 × 3 SrTiO3 supercell (concentration for both the dopants corresponds to 8.33%). Geometry optimization indicates that the cell dimensions increase by 0.019 Å in the X/Y direction and 0.043 Å in the Z direction. The DOS plot for (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 (Fig. 2b) shows the formation of a clean band structure without encountering any localized states. The analysis of the partial density of states (PDOS) indicates that the VBM is composed of Rh 4d and O 2p hybridized states with a higher contribution of the Rh 4d state compared to the O 2p state. This elevates the VBM with respect to that of the undoped SrTiO3, resulting in the band gap narrowing to 2.62 eV. The spin up and spin down part of DOS are found to be symmetrical, indicating the absence of unpaired electrons in the (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3. This is supported by the total magnetic moment value of zero, in agreement with the observation of Niishiro et al.31 As can be seen from Fig. 4b, the t2g set of the Rh 4d orbital is completely occupied (t62g e0g). This is the consequence of transferring the extra electron to the Rh center. To demonstrate the phenomenon of charge transfer more clearly, we analyse Bader charge density at the Rh center in the absence and in the presence of Sb. We employ a grid-based Bader analysis algorithm as implemented in VASP version 5.2 to calculate the charge on the atom center.51 The decrease in Bader charge on the Rh center from 1.61 (Rh-doped SrTiO3) to 1.45 ((Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3) indicates the lower oxidation state of Rh in the latter, consistent with the experimental observation.31 Thus, the present study unambiguously explains the evidence of the Rh3+ state in the (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3.
By comparing the band structure of Rh-doped SrTiO3 in the absence and in the presence of Sb, one can explain the origin of improved photocatalytic activity of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3. In presence of Sb, the acceptor states are completely passivated, thereby reducing the rate of electron–hole recombination. Due to continuous band structure at the band edges, the charge carriers have better mobility in the (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3.52,53 Moreover, Sb5+ stabilizes the Rh3+ state by forming a charge compensated system. This will reduce the formation of vacancies present in the Rh-doped SrTiO3 sample. All these factors favor increased lifetimes for the charge carriers in the (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 system, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity significantly.
3.2. Rh3+ doped SrTiO3
We have also studied the effect of doping with only Rh3+ and compared the results with that of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3. Rh3+-doped SrTiO3 is modelled by adding one extra electron, while keeping the positive background charge the same. The DOS plot for the Rh3+-doped SrTiO3 is shown in Fig. 5. Unlike the case of Rh4+-doped SrTiO3 (Fig. 3a), no acceptor states in between the VB and CB are found in this case. The VBM is composed of a hybridised state of Rh 4d and O 2p, while the CBM is mainly contributed by the Ti 3d state. The band gap for Rh3+-doped SrTiO3 is calculated as 2.60 eV. All these characteristics are very much similar to the case of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 (Fig. 2b). However, the CBM position of SrTiO3 is hardly affected by doping with only Rh3+, while it is significantly shifted in the upward direction due to codoping with both Rh and Sb, thus increasing the reducing behaviour at the CB. Hence, a better hydrogen evolution efficiency is expected in case of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 than Rh3+-doped SrTiO3.Moreover, Rh3+-doped SrTiO3, being a charge non-compensated system, may have a tendency to form undesirable vacancy defects in the crystal structure, promoting the electron–hole recombination rate. This may be one of the limiting factors to achieving a higher photo-conversion efficiency of Rh3+-doped SrTiO3.

3.3. (Rh, N)-codoped SrTiO3
We have extended our study to investigate the role of N as a codopant of Rh-doped SrTiO3. As can be seen from previous experimental studies, N plays the role as an anionic dopant and occupies the oxygen lattice site.11,12 We first investigate the electronic structure of (Rh, N)-codoped SrTiO3 considering N as an anionic dopant. This has been modelled by replacing one of the Ti atoms and O atoms by Rh and N, respectively, in the 2 × 2 × 3 supercell. Full geometry optimization of (Rh, N)-codoped SrTiO3 indicates that N is closer to Rh than Ti. This leads to shortening of Rh–N bond lengths (1.83 Å) and lengthening the Ti–N bond lengths (2.15 Å). The cell volume is increased by 0.64% with respect to that of undoped SrTiO3. The DOS plot has been shown in Fig. 6a and the energy difference between the VBM and impurity states is calculated as 2.59 eV. The acceptor states are shifted in the upward direction and appear closer to the bottom of the CB. This leads to lowering of the CBM level by a significant extent. Analysis of electronic energy levels indicates that the CBM position for (Rh, N)-codoped SrTiO3 is 0.65 eV lower than that of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3. This will make a difference in the reducing behaviour at the CB. In addition, (Rh, N)-codoped SrTiO3 being a charge non-compensated system will form vacancy defects spontaneously.

We will now consider N as a cationic dopant, which has not been explored experimentally to date. Herein, (Rh, N)-codoped SrTiO3 model structure has been constructed by replacing two Ti from a 2 × 2 × 3 supercell with one Rh and one N. In this case, a significant distortion in the host crystal structure is observed due to large difference between the ionic size of Ti4+ (0.605 Å) and N5+ (0.13 Å). The cell volume is increased by 1.27%. The N–O bond length varies in the range 1.20–2.573 Å. The DOS plot has been shown in Fig. 6b. In this case, the Rh-induced acceptor states are found to be completely passivated. The calculated band gap is found to decrease to 2.47 eV due to the shifting of the CBM in the downward direction. Analysis of energy levels indicates that the CBM for (Rh, N)-codoped SrTiO3 is 0.84 eV lower than that of the (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3. This will lead to poor reducing behavior at the CB. Hence, based on this discussion we can justify the choice of Sb as a codopant of Rh-doped SrTiO3.
3.4. Oxygen deficient Rh-doped SrTiO3
We have also investigated the role of oxygen vacancy on the electronic structure of Rh-doped SrTiO3. To model Rh-doped SrTiO3 with a neutral oxygen vacancy, we remove one oxygen atom from a 2 × 2 × 3 SrTiO3 supercell and replace one of the Ti atoms by Rh. The magnetic moment calculation (−0.94 μB) indicates that there is one excess electron, which is localized on the Ti centers. The DOS plot for the oxygen-deficient Rh-doped SrTiO3 has been shown in Fig. 7. The Fermi level is shifted to the CB region due to the excess electron. The nature of the VBM (Rh 4d+ O 2p) looks very much similar to that of Rh3+-doped SrTiO3, while in the case of oxygen-deficient Rh-doped SrTiO3, partially occupied Ti 3d are states introduced adjacent to the CBM. The energy difference between the (Rh 4d, O 2p)-hybridized states and Ti 3d state is calculated to be 2.34 eV. This will extend the absorption curve towards the visible region by a larger extent than that of Rh3+-doped SrTiO3. Unfortunately, the oxygen vacancy is a well known charge carrier trapping center, and will severely diminish the photo-conversion efficiency.

3.5. Defect pair binding energy
The defect pair binding energy (Eb), which provides useful information about the stability of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3, is defined as54 Eb = ERh-SrTiO3 + ESb-SrTiO3 − E(Rh,Sb)-SrTiO3 − ESrTiO3(2)where the total energy (E), of the undoped, monodoped and codoped system has been calculated using a supercell of equal dimensions. The positive value of the calculated binding energy (1.13 eV per supercell) for the (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 justifies its stability in the real scenario.
3.6. Defect formation energy
Calculation of the defect formation energy has been carried out to find out the relative feasibility of the synthesis of an Rh-doped SrTiO3 sample in the absence and in the presence of Sb. Since all the cases involve the substitution of Ti, we define the defect formation energy as55,56 ΔHf = Edoped + nTiμTi − ESrTiO3 − nSbμSb − nRhμRh,(3)where Edoped represents the total energy of the monodoped/codoped SrTiO3. Herein, nX defines the number of atoms of element X (Rh/Sb) introduced or removed (Ti) during formation of doped materials, while μX is the elemental chemical potential of the species Ti, Rh and Sb.
When SrTiO3 is in equilibrium with the reservoir of its constituent elements (Sr, Ti and O), one can write the following relation μSr + μTi + 3μO = μSrTiO3(bulk).(4)
The heat of formation for SrTiO3 can be calculated using the expression below Δ = μSrTiO3(bulk) − μSr(bulk) − μTi(bulk) − 3μO(gas).(5)herein, Δ is a negative quantity as SrTiO3 is a stable compound.
The elemental chemical potential always has a value either smaller than or equal to the chemical potential in bulk or gaseous form, and thus the range of elemental chemical potential of the species can be defined as μSr(bulk) + Δ ≤ μSr ≤ μSr(bulk)(6a) μTi(bulk) + Δ ≤ μTi ≤ μTi(bulk)(6b) 3μO(gas) + Δ ≤ 3μO ≤ 3μO(gas).(6c) The values for μSr(bulk) and μTi(bulk) are calculated from the energy of strontium atom and titanium atom, respectively, in the pure bulk metallic state. For μO(gas), we calculate the energy of an oxygen atom in the diatomic oxygen molecule taken at the center of a 20 Å × 20 Å × 20 Å cubic box.

Fig. 8 presents the defect formation energy profile for the monodoped as well as codoped SrTiO3. The common characteristic for all cases is that the defect formation energy increases as we proceed from Ti-poor to Ti-rich conditions. This is expected as the formation of a Ti vacancy is energetically unfavorable under Ti-rich conditions. The formation energy calculation indicates that the doping with Sb is energetically more favorable by 2.0 eV than Rh-doping. It is interesting to note that the cost of Rh doping significantly decreases in presence of Sb in Ti-poor conditions. Hence, the formation of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 is energetically more favorable than the (Rh/Sb)-monodoped SrTiO3.

3.7. Effect of concentration
We extended our study to investigate the scenario when the concentrations of Rh and Sb are increased or decreased by equal extents. For this purpose, we considered 2 × 2 × 2 and 2 × 3 × 3 supercells to introduce one Rh and one Sb at the Ti lattice sites, corresponding to dopant concentrations of 12.5% and 5.5%. Both the structures are relaxed fully using the same functional as well as energy convergence criteria, as discussed in the earlier section. The respective k-point meshes used for sampling the Brillouin zones are 8 × 8 × 8 and 6 × 4 × 4. The defect formation energy (Fig. 8) is found to be of the same order of magnitude as that calculated using a 2 × 2 × 3 supercell. This justifies our choice of supercell sizes in the present calculation. The DOS plots for (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 calculated using the 2 × 2 × 2 and 2 × 3 × 3 supercells are shown in Fig. 9a and b, respectively. Comparison of Fig. 9a and b with Fig. 2b indicates that changing of dopant concentration in the above-mentioned range does not have a significant effect on the nature of the DOS of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3. The VBM is mainly contributed by Rh 4d and O 2p hybridized states and CBM is composed of the Ti 3d state. However, the impurity states at the VBM are found to be less delocalized in the case of the lower concentration of Rh and Sb. The band gap of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 at the higher and lower concentrations of the dopant elements are found to be 2.62 eV and 2.65 eV, respectively.

3.8. Effect of different dopant proportion
In a recent experimental study, Niishiro et al. synthesized a series of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 samples with different proportions of Rh and Sb and investigated their efficiency in producing hydrogen and oxygen during the water splitting reaction.31 According to their report, the material with a relatively higher proportion of Rh shows poor oxygen evolution efficiency. In addition, an Sb-rich codoped sample shows moderate efficiency for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Finally, they suggested that the ratio of Sb and Rh should be unity for achieving the highest oxygen evolution efficiency. To explain these observations more clearly, one needs to investigate the electronic structure of SrTiO3 codoped with different ratios of Rh and Sb. For this purpose, we consider here 2:1 and 1:2 (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3. In the present study, the 2:1 codoped system has been modeled by introducing two Rh and one Sb at the Ti lattice sites of the 2 × 2 × 3 supercell (dopant concentrations: Rh: 16.67%, Sb: 8.33%). The computational parameters are kept fixed at the same values as used in the case of 1:1 codoping. The DOS plot for the 2:1 (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 is shown in Fig. 10a, wherein it is clear that the spin-up and spin-down parts are unsymmetrical, indicating the presence of unpaired electrons. Calculation of the magnetic moment also shows the existence of unpaired electrons in the 2:1 (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3, which is as expected due to an insufficient amount of Sb, which is responsible for providing an extra electron to pair the d electrons of Rh. The DOS plot shows the presence of partially occupied and unoccupied states, similar to the case of doping with only Rh. This divides the band gap into two regions, with energy gaps of 1.05 eV and 1.15 eV. Although this improves the visible light activity significantly, it drastically affects the oxygen evolution. Analysis of the PDOS indicates that these states are hybrid states, composed of Rh 4d and O 2p orbitals.

In addition, the model for 1:2 codoping is constructed by replacing three Ti atoms with one Rh and two Sb in a 2 × 2 × 3 SrTiO3 supercell, which corresponds to dopant concentrations for Rh and Sb of 8.33% and 16.67%, respectively. The DOS plot for the 1:2 (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 is shown in Fig. 10b. The Fermi level is in the CB region, indicating the presence of excess electron, which is a consequence of an unequal proportion of electron donors and acceptors. This leads to a net total magnetic moment of −0.9 μB contributed by Ti, i.e., the extra electron is localized on the Ti center, which is also responsible for the appearance of occupied Ti 3d states at the bottom of the CB, similar to the case of Sb-doping. The VBM is contributed by Rh 4d and O 2p hybrid states, similar to the case of 1:1 codoping. The calculated energy difference between the VBM and occupied state at the CB is found to be 2.39 eV. Hence, from a consideration of the utilization of the visible region of solar light, both 2:1 and 1:2 codoping approaches are attractive. However, due to charge non-compensated nature, there is a possibility of spontaneous formation of vacancy defects, which are known to work as electron–hole recombination centers. Hence, both are expected to achieve lower photo-conversion efficiency when compared to the case of 1:1 codoping.
3.9. Optical property
To investigate the change in the optical property of SrTiO3 due to codoping with Rh and Sb, we calculated the frequency-dependent dielectric function, which is defined as ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω). The real part, ε1(ω), is calculated from the Kramers–Kronig relation, while the imaginary part, ε2(ω), is calculated by summing over the unoccupied states. The expression for the absorption coefficient, α(ω), is given by57 (7)Fig. 11 shows the optical spectrum for the undoped and codoped SrTiO3. The absorption curve for the undoped SrTiO3 is found to be shifted towards the visible region due to codoping with Rh and Sb. This is due to reduction of the band gap on codoping. This explains the observation of improved photocatalytic activity of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 under visible light.

3.10. Band edge alignment
As can be seen from the experimental studies, the introduction of Sb to Rh-doped SrTiO3 not only improves the photo-conversion efficiency but also makes it active for oxygen evolution. To explain this, we align the band edge positions of all the model systems with respect to the water redox levels. A material is active for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution only when its CBM position lies above the water reduction potential (H+/H2) and its VBM position is below the water oxidation potential (H2O/O2). In the first step, the band edge positions for the undoped SrTiO3 are fixed based on the experimental reports, wherein the CBM is found to be 0.8 eV above the H+/H2 level and the VBM is 1.17 eV below the H2O/O2 level.58 We then obtained the band edge locations of the doped SrTiO3 based on the extent of shifting of the CBM and VBM levels relative to that of the undoped SrTiO3. As can be seen from Fig. 12, in the case of Rh-doped SrTiO3, although the CBM position is suitable for hydrogen evolution, an unoccupied state is located just above the H2O/O2 level, which may be responsible for the experimental observation of poor oxygen evolution property of Rh-doped SrTiO3.31,32 In the case of Rh3+-doped SrTiO3, the VBM is significantly elevated with respect to that of undoped SrTiO3, while the CBM position is hardly affected. In the case of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3, both CBM and VBM are found to be located in suitable positions with respect to water redox levels for the spontaneous release of both hydrogen and oxygen. Thus, the presence of Sb makes Rh-doped SrTiO3 active for oxygen evolution activity by passivating the unoccupied mid-gap states. As can be seen from Fig. 12, the positions of VBM and CBM for 1:2 (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 are such that it is active for overall water splitting, which is consistent with the experimental observation. Lower oxygen evolution efficiency with respect to the 1:1 codoped SrTiO3 can be explained by the elevation of the VBM by a larger extent. In addition, in case of 2:1 (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3, the presence of unoccupied states above the water oxidation level may be responsible for the poor oxygen evolution activity. Thus, the present theoretical study reproduces the experimental outcomes as well as properly explains their origin.

4. Conclusion
In this theoretical study, we have employed hybrid DFT to investigate the origin of improved photocatalytic properties of Rh-doped SrTiO3 towards overall water splitting in the presence of Sb. In the Rh-doped SrTiO3, the formal oxidation state of Rh is +4, which introduces localized mid-gap states due to the partially occupied t2g subset. These states not only act as charge carrier trapping centers but also drastically affect the oxygen evolution (water oxidation). However, they are found to be completely passivated when Sb is introduced as a codopant. Sb, when occupies Ti4+ lattice sites, leaves one extra electron to achieve its most stable +5 oxidation state. This extra electron is utilized to lower the oxidation state of Rh to +3, which is indicated in the Bader charge analysis, wherein the Bader charge on the Rh center is found to be reduced upon codoping with Sb. This also brings a change in the magnetic behavior, thus converting paramagnetic Rh-doped SrTiO3 to diamagnetic (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3. The t2g subset of the Rh 4d orbital in the (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 is found to be fully occupied. The activity of (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 towards the evolution of both oxygen and hydrogen has been explained by its suitable band edge alignment with respect to the water redox levels. It is observed that the band gap of the codoped system is hardly influenced by a change in the concentration of both the dopant elements by equal extents within the range studied here. However, the electronic structure of the codoped system is found to be strongly dependent on the ratio of the dopant elements. Thus, the codoping of Rh and Sb in a ratio 2:1 results in a band structure, which has characteristics almost similar to that of Rh-doped SrTiO3, limiting the photocatalytic behavior towards overall water splitting. Moreover, the electronic structure analysis of 1:2 (Rh, Sb)-codoped SrTiO3 indicates its ability to produce both hydrogen and oxygen during water splitting, in agreement with the experimental studies. The lower activity of the 1:2 codoped system with respect to the 1:1 codoped system is due to its charge non-compensated nature. Thus, the present theoretical study nicely reproduces the experimental observations and explains their origin.
