Despite this attention, the promise for electrochemical ammonia synthesis is unclear, as most electrochemical technology performance is well below that of the Haber–Bosch process (state of the art). Thus, there is a growing interest in defining realistic performance targets which would make renewable ammonia derived from electrochemical systems a reality. However, most efforts thus far have only explored optimizing single technology specific performance metrics such as faradaic efficiency. Optimization of this single performance metric often occurs at the expense of the rate of production which drives implementation and thus can be misleading. Here, we aim to outline the performance targets achievable for renewable ammonia produced through intermediate temperature electrosynthesis. Through exploring the thermodynamic and kinetic challenges, we highlight the optimum expected rate of production and energy efficiency for intermediate temperature electrosynthesis. We also review current experimental reports focused on intermediate temperature ammonia electrosynthesis and detail materials related opportunities in catalyst and solid-electrolyte design. Finally, we discuss some of the challenges related to reporting these desired metrics due to measurement error, and offer solutions to mitigate these challenges.Marta C.

1 Introduction
Mounting concern regarding the carbon footprint of fertilizer production has stimulated growing interest in renewable ammonia. Renewable ammonia encompasses strategies to produce ammonia using non-fossil feedstocks in order to mitigate carbon emissions. These renewable approaches have centered primarily on low temperature (20–50 °C) and pressure (1–10 atm) technologies based around nitrogen electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and plasma driven catalysis.1–4 Electro- and photocatalysis are often deemed sustainable, as the only required reactants are air and water, and the only energy source is electricity or light. However, low temperature and pressure systems suffer from low rates of production (10−11 mol cm−2 s−1), faradaic efficiency (10−2–10%), and energy efficiencies (1–2%).5 Plasma-enabled catalysis is a catalyst free approach which has exhibited high faradaic efficiency, but still suffers from low energy efficiency.4,6
The low performance is unsurprising, as for a century, the Haber–Bosch process has only overcome these limitations through performing nitrogen reduction at elevated temperature (350–500 °C) and pressure (150–350 atm). The Haber–Bosch process achieves production rates which approach 6 g NH3 kgcat−1 min−1 at an energy efficiency of 60%.5,7 This often equates to areal rates of production (i.e. rate normalized to the geometric area of the catalyst layer) similar to an electrocatalyst (10−11 mol cm−2 s−1), yet the form factor of a catalyst bed reactor employed in thermocatalytic processes enables high volumetric catalyst loading since the catalyst does not need to be supported on an electrically conductive substrate (electrode).
In addition to electrocatalysis at ambient conditions, there has been numerous attempts to attain renewable ammonia through low pressure and high temperature routes. The three primary mid- and high temperature routes include thermoelectrocatalysis, Haber–Bosch process with absorbent-based separations, and solar thermal ammonia production (STAP).8–11 All three approaches produce ammonia with energy efficiencies which approach that achieved through the large-scale Haber–Bosch process (60%).5 Despite these promising routes, low pressure-high temperature systems are often under investigated because of an increasing emphasis on ambient temperature processes.
The range of approaches to attain renewable ammonia prompt a need to better understand the thermodynamic and kinetic limitations of each approach. Herein, we discuss the relevant theoretical and experimental motivations for electrochemical synthesis of ammonia at intermediate temperature and low pressure. We also discuss the potential materials related challenges which need to be addressed for intermediate ammonia synthesis to come to fruition. Lastly, we highlight challenges with ammonia detection and suggest approaches to overcome this limitation.
2 Performance considerations for intermediate temperature ammonia electrosynthesis
Electrochemical systems are attractive alternatives to the Haber–Bosch process because they enable the transformation of electrical energy into chemical energy, using primarily an applied voltage as the driving force for catalysis. In theory, an electrochemical reactor can achieve nitrogen conversions which approach those attained through the Haber–Bosch process.12 Yet, thermodynamics is not the only considerations for determining whether a catalytic process is effective. Ultimately, the rate of ammonia production is also essential for determining if a technology is economically and technically useful. This requires a thorough understanding of the kinetics of reaction under standard operating conditions.
2.1 Kinetic considerations
A thermochemical reactor operating at low temperature results in low production rates at nearly all pressures (Fig. 1a and b – zone 1). Increasing the temperature only marginally increases production rates, as the shifting equilibrium point begins to favor ammonia decomposition. Thus, a reactor operating at high temperature suffers from low conversion efficiency (Fig. 1a and b – zone 3). The use of elevated pressure is necessary to offset this equilibrium shift, and maximize product yield in the Haber–Bosch process. The optimal operating temperature and pressure for thermocatalytic conversion of nitrogen to ammonia also depends on the concentration of ammonia in the reactor. For instance increasing the concentration from 1% (Fig. 1a) to 10% (Fig. 1b) shifts the optimum temperature and pressure. Overall, optimal operation occurs at intermediate temperature (∼400 °C) and moderate pressure (∼200 atm) (Fig. 1a and b – zone 2).
 Fig. 1  Ammonia production rate for thermochemical synthesis with an ammonia molar fraction of 1% (a) and 10% (b), and for electrochemical synthesis at ambient pressure with an ammonia molar fraction of 1% (c) and 10% (d). The red line indicates the conditions necessary to obtain a similar rate to the Haber–Bosch process. The red region highlights where the thermodynamic equilibrium prevents the production of ammonia. The figure has three regions (1,2, and 3) representing the three temperature regimes (low ≤300 °C, intermediate 300–600 °C, and high >600 °C). A detailed explanation of the analysis used to develop this figure can be found in the ESI.† 
In an electrocatalytic reactor, an applied voltage drives the catalytic process instead of temperature (Fig. 1c and d). Theoretically, an electrochemical cell can achieve similar production rates as a thermocatalytic reactor. For instance, if the cell voltage is increased to 210 mV, an electrochemical reactor can achieve a production rate comparable to a thermocatalytic reactor at ambient temperature (red line represents a production rate of 6 × 10−6 mol g−1 s−1). This cell voltage is equivalent to a 260 mV overpotential. However, this high overpotential is often deemed prohibitively expensive because the cost of electricity dominates the cost of the product (levelized cost of ammonia – LCOA).13,14 To put this overpotential into perspective, in water electrolysis (hydrogen production), the hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential is only on the order of 10–100 mV.15 We will also note that the reaction overpotential may be even larger in practice, as the kinetic model must make assumptions regarding kinetic constants (see ESI†).
Thus, in order for electrochemical ammonia synthesis to become viable, efforts are needed to reduce the nitrogen reduction reaction overpotential to reduce the LCOA. There are significant bottom-up efforts on-going in the area of catalyst design which aim to reduce catalyst surface overpotential. However, these approaches have yet to discover or identify any effective highly active catalyst for nitrogen reduction at ambient conditions. Thus, alternative system operations-based strategies should also be explored to enhance the rate of production. One immediate way to reduce the required overpotential is to alter the system operating temperature (Fig. 1c and d). Increasing the temperature of the cell to the intermediate range (<600 °C), can reduce required cell voltage by 33% (∼140 mV) and eliminate the activation overpotential (∼1 mV) (Fig. 1c and d – zone 2). This is still energy intensive, but is a better entry point for electrochemical ammonia synthesis. Operation at high temperature (>600 °C) still results in ammonia decomposition, and thus is not advisable (Fig. 1c and d – zone 3).
An additional advantage of an electrochemical system over a thermocatalytic systems is the ability to attain a desired production rate over a wider range of temperatures and concentrations (ammonia). In thermochemical systems, the required pressure to maintain the same production rate increases by 300% when the concentration of ammonia increases from 1% to 10% for a thermochemical reactor operating at 400 °C. A similar increase in ammonia concentration only requires a 75% increase in the required voltage for an electrochemical reactor operating at 600 °C.
2.2 Energy efficiency considerations
The Haber–Bosch process is highly efficient (60%)5 when compared to electrochemical synthesis-based technologies (1%).5 Improving the Haber–Bosch energy efficiency further is possible (thermodynamic limit is ∼90%),16 and efforts which succeed in increasing this efficiency will aid in minimizing the carbon emissions associated with the Haber–Bosch process. However, energy efficiency improvements are not necessary to promote the economic viability of the Haber–Bosch process. Conversely, energy efficiency improvements are imperative in order to improve the economic viability of electrochemical ammonia synthesis system. This is due to the innate interdependencies between energy efficiency and system size (capital cost), and energy usage (operating costs).
The energy efficiency for an electrochemical system is largely governed by the system faradaic efficiency. A faradaic efficiency of 100% indicates that all the current is utilized to reduce nitrogen, and a faradaic efficiency of 0% indicates that no current is utilized to reduce nitrogen. In the case where faradaic efficiency is negligible, the electrons most likely are used to produce hydrogen, an unwanted side product. Most nitrogen reduction electrocatalysts today achieve faradaic efficiencies between (10−2–10%).5 Higher faradaic efficiencies have been reported, but typically are obtained at impractically low current.5
Increasing faradaic efficiency requires the design of catalyst with a high degree of selectivity for nitrogen reduction. This is a significant challenge as the redox potential for nitrogen reduction (E° = 0.056 vs. RHE at 25 °C and E° = −0.140 vs. RHE at 600 °C) resides close to the more facile hydrogen evolution reaction (E° = 0 vs. RHE). Furthermore, most surfaces preferentially bind H* rather than N* which reduces the number of active sites for nitrogen activation. Catalyst design and system operations are therefore critical in order to overcome these challenges (see Section 3.2).
In order for low-temperature electrochemical ammonia synthesis to approach the energy efficiency of the Haber–Bosch process (∼60%), the system needs to approach a faradaic efficiency close to ∼80% (Fig. 2a). This is not feasible with aqueous-based electrolytes, and is even challenging in a non-aqueous environment at relevant current densities. The required faradaic efficiency for an intermediate-temperature electrochemical ammonia synthesis system to approach the energy efficiency of the Haber–Bosch process is 75% (Fig. 2b). This is still ambitious. To put this into perspective, carbon dioxide based electrolysis systems have been able to obtain faradaic efficiency which approach 50–80% for the conversion of CO2 to CO.17,18 Even though the electrical energy required by an intermediate-temperature system is lower than the electrical energy required by a low-temperature system, the total energy required is equivalent in both systems due to the additional heat input necessary in intermediate-temperature systems. This suggests that both low and intermediate temperature electrolysis cells may not be able to achieve energy efficiencies which meet the Haber–Bosch process. Therefore, practical targets for energy efficiency are necessary. As with all renewable technologies, the energy conversion efficiency will not need to approach that of thermal systems. This is because of the relative abundance of renewable energy (sun) when compared to fossil fuels. However, in order to limit the system size, energy efficiencies on the order of 20–40% are ideal.
 Fig. 2  Energy efficiency of a low temperature electrochemical ammonia synthesis cell (25 °C), with a reference exchange current density of 10−10 A cm−2, an electrolyte ionic conductivity of 0.1 S cm−1 (Nafion), a electrolyte thickness of 60 μm, and catalyst loading is 1 mg cm−2 (a). Energy efficiency of a intermediate temperature electrochemical ammonia synthesis cell (600 °C), with a reference exchange current density of 10−10 A cm−2, an electrolyte ionic conductivity of 0.014 S cm−1, a electrolyte thickness of 50 μm, and catalyst loading is 1 mg cm−2 (b) red line indicates an achievable energy efficiency for the Haber–Bosch process. 
Increasing the energy efficiency of the system can also be accomplished through reducing system losses. While a complete electrochemical systems will have many components (compressors, pumps, separation devices), most system losses are associated with the electrochemical cell. Losses within an electrochemical cell, termed overpotentials, must be reduced to maximize efficiency. The three primary overpotentials are ohmic, activation, and mass transport losses.
The largest ohmic loss in an electrochemical reactor is due to the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. Within low temperature electrolysis systems, the electrolyte is largely polymer based, and the conductivity (inverse of resistance) increases moderately with temperature (Fig. S3†).19,20. The low temperature electrolytes have conductivity order of 0.1 S cm−1 (ref. 19) (Fig. 3a). For intermediate temperature operation, the ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes is highly dependent on temperature. Solid electrolytes have poor ionic conductivity at low temperatures (0.002 S cm−1),20 but improve at intermediate and high temperatures (0.01–0.04 S cm−1 – Table 1). Therefore, even when operating optimally the intermediate temperature solid electrolytes are about an order of magnitude more resistive than the low temperature polymer based electrolytes (Fig. 3b). For this reason, the ohmic losses are generally negligible with respect to the other losses in a low temperature electrolysis cell, but dominate cell losses in an intermediate temperature electrolysis cell (Fig. 3).

The activation overpotential depends on the kinetics of the reaction, and improves as the temperature increases due to the Arrhenius relationship. A reactor operating at ambient temperature has an activation overpotential of 400 mV. As temperature increases to 600 °C, the activation overpotential decreases to 0.3 mV. For these reasons, highly active electrocatalyst (such as certain precious metals) are desirable for low temperature cells, whereas less active (such as earth abundant metals) electrocatalyst are generally acceptable for higher temperature cells. Temperature effects will have a marginal impact on transport related losses. Increasing the temperature increases the diffusivity of nitrogen in aqueous media, allowing for a slight decrease in mass transport losses. Higher temperatures will also promote the use of gas-diffusion layer based cells which have significantly less transport related losses than liquid aqueous phase systems.21
As ammonia electrosynthesis continues to grow, care must be placed on understanding system level limitations. Catalyst design is highly important for achieving high faradaic efficiency. However, in order to approach the reaction rates and energy efficiency of the Haber–Bosch process, intermediate temperature operations should be investigated. In the subsequent section, we summarize the state-of-the-art in electrolyte and catalyst materials.
3 Current progress in intermediate temperature ammonia electrosynthesis
The central component of a solid oxide electrolysis cell is the membrane electrode assembly, which is composed of two electrodes (anode and cathode) and a dense solid electrolyte. When a proton conducting electrolyte is employed, N2 reduction and H2 or H2O oxidation reactions occur at the cathode and anode (Fig. 4a). In contrast reactors with oxygen ion-conducting electrolytes have N2 and H2O (steam) reacting at the cathode to produce ammonia, and oxygen evolution at the anode. Thus, oxygen ion-conducting electrolytes are more challenging to implement (detailed in Section 3.2).
 Fig. 4  (a) Proton and (b) oxygen-ion conducting solid electrolytes have been investigated for intermediate temperature ammonia electrosynthesis cells. 
All components must exhibit chemical and mechanical stability at intermediate temperatures (200–650 °C) to be viable for electrosynthesis. The anode and cathode electrodes are ideally porous to enable gas transport and are comprised of an inorganic mixed ion and electron conductor and an active catalyst (Fig. 4). The solid electrolyte must show high ionic conductivity, chemical compatibility with the catalyst, and negligible electronic conductivity. Trace electronic conductivity in a solid electrolyte can decrease the transference number and current efficiency of a cell. Thus, material interactions between the catalyst, electrode, and electrolyte is immensely important for engineering durable solid oxide electrolysis cells.
This section aims to highlight the current state-of-the-art materials for ammonia electrosynthesis. In particular, we discuss how materials can be engineered to enhance the rate of production and energy efficiency of the electrochemical cell. Specific attention is focused on identifying pathways toward achieving high faradaic efficiencies (>70%) and high ionic conductivities (>0.1 S cm−1). A full review of these materials can be found elsewhere.22–24
3.1 Solid electrolytes
The most common solid electrolytes used are proton, oxide ion, and nitride ion conductors. With the exception of oxygen conductors, the ions being conducted through the electrolyte may also serve as hydrogen or nitrogen sources for ammonia synthesis. Often, the solid electrolytes are made from ceramic based materials, and thus conductivity is heavily dependent on temperature (200–650 °C). Below we briefly discuss opportunities for solid electrolyte design.

3.1.1 Proton conducting inorganic electrolytes. 
Inorganic proton solid electrolytes are the most common electrolyte. There are three families of proton conducting electrolytes being explored for intermediate temperature ammonia electrosynthesis: (1) solid acids,25–28 (2) oxides (perovskites, flourites, pyrochlores) (Fig. 5),22,29−32 and (3) composite electrolytes (oxide/binary phosphates and oxide/ternary carbonates).
 Fig. 5  The primary solid electrolytes investigated for intermediate electrosynthesis of ammonia are perovskites, fluorites and pyrochlores (Reproduced with permission,22 Elsevier). 
Solid acid electrolytes were first introduced in 2001 and operate between 100-300 °C.33 Common stoichiometries for solid acid electrolytes are MHXO4, MH2XO4, and M3H(XO4)2, where M can be Cs, Rb, K, Na, and/or NH4, and X can be P, S, Se, and As. Fundamentally, this family of electrolytes are comprised of oxyanions (e.g. SO42−, SeO42−, etc.) that are connected together via hydrogen bonds.26,34 As the operating temperature increases from 100 to 300 °C, a phase transition occurs which results in a more disordered structure, and subsequently an order of magnitude increase in the ionic conductivity. This increase in ionic conductivity is associated with rapid reorientation of XO42− anion groups which enables more facile proton transport between neighboring anion groups.26,34
One of the most promising solid acid electrolytes is CsH2PO4. This electrolyte transforms from a monoclinic to a cubic phase upon heating at ≈228 °C and experiences a four-fold increase in the ionic conductivity (>10−2 S cm−1).35 The melting temperature of a solid acid electrolyte can vary widely depending on the stoichiometry. One strategy employed to increase the melting temperature is the introduction of oxide (e.g. SiO2) or pyrophosphate (SiP2O7).36,37 CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 composites form CsH5(PO4)2 at the interfaces of the two materials which leads to higher ionic conductivities at lower temperatures. Furthermore, this composite demonstrates a nearly constant ionic conductivity (≥20 mS cm−1) between 100 to 270 °C (ref. 37 and 38) (Fig. 6). Finally, the addition of SiP2O7 reduces the solid electrolyte's plasticity which enables more compliant interfaces and less short-circuiting.35

Recently, a wide-range of solid acid electrolytes (e.g. CsHSO4;39 Rb3H(SeO4)2;40 and (NH4)3H(SO4)2 (ref. 41)) have been explored for electrosynthesis of ammonia. A significant challenge with solid acid electrolytes is electrolyte decomposition when in contact with a base (e.g. NH3). One solution explored in the literature is the use of a proton conducting barrier film (e.g. AgPd), coated directly onto a CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 solid electrolyte. The barrier film mitigates acid/base interactions, enables proton transport, and allows for the use of dry gases (e.g. H2).42,43 A faradaic efficiency around 2.6% was achieved using a barrier film. Another study examined a barrier-free CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 electrolyte with a range of noble-metal catalysts and could only achieve faradaic efficiencies ∼0.15%. In the absence of a barrier, it is necessary to utilize humidified gases to avoid dehydration.38 Overall, the faradaic efficiency and synthesis rate were shown to decrease at voltages greater than 0.3 V. At low voltages (0.15 V) all catalysts (except Ru) showed similar synthesis rates of 0.8 × 10−10 mol cm−2 s−1 at 220 °C.38 A wide range of side reactions can occur at elevated voltages including (1) the electrolyte decomposition at the catalyst|electrolyte interface and (2) the formation of hydrogen gas. Thus, low electrosynthesis voltages are desirable to avoid side reaction and achieve high energy efficiency in solid acid electrolytes.
The second family of electrolytes being explored for intermediate temperature ammonia electrosynthesis are oxide solid electrolytes. Three prominent proton conducting oxides include: (1) perovskite, (2) flourite, and (3) pyrochlore (Fig. 5). Proton transport in oxides primarily occurs through the Grotthuss mechanism which involves proton hopping between neighboring oxygen atoms.51,52 Transport properties can be tuned via increasing the concentration of protonic defects (e.g. OH− or oxyanions).53 Tuning the defect chemistry via elemental doping is one strategy often employed to increase the oxygen vacancy concentration.26,34 These solid electrolytes typically operate between 400 and 650 °C. Thus, the operating temperature is similar to the Haber–Bosch and can even exceed it at times. Thermodynamically, ammonia decomposition at these temperatures is possible as discussed in Section 2, and should be avoided.
The ion in the electrolyte can act both as a charge carrying element and as a catalytic promoter. The mobile ion in the electrolyte can dynamically alter the electronic structure of the catalyst and influence the binding energies of the reactant and/or adsorbed molecules.54–56 This phenomena is known as non-Faradaic electrochemical modification of catalytic activity (NEMCA)57,58 or electrochemical promotion of catalysis (EPOC).59,60 Thus, control over transport within the electrolyte and at the electrolyte|electrode interface may provide a pathway toward controlling adsorbates and reaction kinetics.
Perovskite's have the general form ABO3, where A is typically Ba, Sr, Ca and/or La and B is either Ce or Zr. Oxygen vacancies in perovskite oxides determine material structures and properties such as ionic charge transport. The concentration of oxygen vacancies can be increased via doping the B-site with aliovalent cations such as yttrium or ytterbium. Perovskites with cerium ions in the B-site demonstrate a high ionic conductivity due to its exceedingly negative hydration enthalpy (e.g. −162.2 kJ mol−1 for Ba(Ce0.9Y0.1)O3−δ (ref. 61)). Hydroxyl terminating groups can be retained at high temperatures when the hydration enthalpy becomes increasingly negative.62 However many bulk electrolytes that have cerium atoms in the lattice are chemically unstable due to the formation of carbonates (e.g. as in the case of BaCeO3 and SrCeO3).26,53 Thus, zirconium and yttrium are doped into the B-site of these cerates to promote stability.30
Early work using a perovskite, proton-conducting strontia–ceria–ytterbia (SCY) electrolyte (SrCe0.95Yb0.95O3), explored ammonia decomposition during ammonia synthesis at elevated temperatures (≥500 °C).58 At 750 °C, using symmetric Pd electrodes, a synthesis rate ∼4.8 × 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1 was achieved. Furthermore, ammonia decomposition was shown to decrease at these high temperatures due to the NEMCA effect. In particular, proton ‘spillover’ can spread on the metal catalyst and form dipoles which decreases the catalyst potential. In this particular work, this led to a decrease in the catalyst's binding strength to electron donating adsorbates such as NH3.58,63 The latter effect is attributed to the decrease in ammonia decomposition. In a follow up study, contradicting results were observed for a SCY electrolyte coupled with Ag catalysts. This system experienced increases in ammonia decomposition upon applying a constant current.64 These results suggest that the nature of the triple boundary and local electric field may play a role on the local binding energy. Additional investigations have been conducted using an SCY electrolyte with catalysts (e.g. Ag, AgPd) with little improvement to the synthesis rate.31,64,65 Low synthesis rates have been attributed to low ionic conductivity and high ohmic resistances in SCY (Fig. 6).
Alternatively, there has been a significant interest in highly conducting BaCeO3-based and BaZrO3-based perovskite solid electrolytes. To improve the ionic conductivity the B-site is doped with yttrium to produce the commonly known BCY and BZY solid electrolytes. BaCe0.85Y0.15O3−δ (BCY) was implemented in a symmetric AgPd and achieved a rate of 2.1 × 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1 and efficiency above 60% at 500 °C in a humidified hydrogen environment.66 The electrolyte's transference number for protons (i.e. fraction of current for protons relative to the total current) was near unity, but began to decrease as the applied current exceeded 12 mA cm−2. This phenomenon was attributed to polarization of the electrode and a reduced concentration of protons at the interface between the electrolyte and electrocatalyst. This however did not affect the synthesis rate since the optimal current density was found to be 0.75 mA cm−2. Barium cerates (e.g. BCY) are chemically unstable with acidic reactants, while barium zirconates are known to be more stable. Table 1 summarizes the performances for a range of BZY and BCY electrolytes tested for electrosynthesis of ammonia.
Fluorite (AO2) and pyrochlore (A2B2O7) structured proton conductors are also used for ammonia electrosynthesis (Table 1). Fluorite structured electrolytes have oxygen ions in cubic packing and tetravalent metal cations in alternating cube centers (Fig. 5). Pyrochlores have an ordered defective fluorite structure where the A and B atoms are trivalent and tetravalent cations, respectively. Previously a AgPd|La1.9Ca0.1Zr2O6.95|AgPd cell synthesized ammonia at a rate of 2 × 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1 and had a faradaic efficiency of 80% at 500 °C using hydrogen and nitrogen.67 Calcium doping causes the grains to enlarge and increases the grains and the grain boundary ionic conductivity.
The final type of proton conducting solid electrolyte being studied in ammonia electrosynthesis are composite electrolytes. These electrolytes combine two different types of ion conducting media and may actually have multiple charge carriers (i.e. H+ and N3−): (1) oxide and (2) phosphates or carbonates.44,68–70 Combining multiple ion conductors together can enable tunable material properties (e.g. transport, thermal, mechanical, and/or electrical) (Fig. 6). Ternary, carbonate-based composite electrolytes commonly use (Li,Na,K)2CO3 because it has a relatively low melting point (396 °C) and can achieve reasonable ion conductivities (100 mS cm−1) at 400 °C.71 Recently, a ceria-Ca3(PO4)2-K3PO4 electrolyte was used to synthesize ammonia, where the hydrogen source was natural gas.68,69 A synthesis rate ∼6.95 × 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1 was achieved at 650 °C. Interestingly, there was an increase in ammonia synthesis rate as the temperature increased from 400 to 650 °C, suggesting that ammonia decomposition was not affected by the temperature increase. However, in another study using a LiAlO2-carbonate electrolyte with a AgPd anode and a Fe3Mo3N–Ag cathode synthesized ammonia at a rate of 1.88 × 10−10 mol cm−2 s−1 with a faradaic efficiency of 1.84% at 425 °C. In this study, the rate and efficiency decreased as the temperature increased, suggesting ammonia decomposition played a role. Thus, the nature of ammonia decomposition in these mixed material systems are not well understood. Composites may be a pathway forward to tailor interfaces for either chemical stability or directed transport. Table 1 summarizes the current performance results for all reported composite electrolytes.


3.1.2 Proton conducting polymer electrolytes. 
Proton conducting polymer electrolytes such as perfluorosulfonic acid (e.g. Nafion) are typically used in ambient, low temperature electrosynthesis. However, Nafion operationally is limited to ≤90 °C,104,105 and recent studies suggest that they may not be suitable because it has a tendency to absorb ammonia resulting in accelerated decomposition of Nafion.106 Despite the lack of studies, intermediate temperature synthesis of ammonia could benefit from using polymer electrolytes. High-temperature, polymer electrolyte membranes (HT-PEMs) are capable of operating within 100 to 200 °C without the need of humidification (as is the case for Nafion). Phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole (PBI) is a well-known high temperature membrane investigated for its use in H2/O2 fuel cells, wherein it attains a power density within 500–800 mW cm−2 at 100 to 200 °C in a hydrogen/air mixture.107 By comparison, solid oxide fuel cells attain power densities near 100 mW cm−2 at 350 °C and 1400 mW cm−2 at 700 °C.108,109 However, steam cannot be used as a hydrogen source with PBI electrolytes because it will cause a loss in phosphoric acid groups. A more promising polymer is the SnP2O7/Nafion composite, which attains a high ionic conductivity of 100 mS cm−1 at 200 °C, a similar power density of 800 mW cm−2, and is stable in dry and wet conditions for over 1400 hours.110
Polymer electrolytes that can sustain higher temperatures represent a very promising area for growth because scalable manufacturing methods are available. However to date, there have been limited investigations that have been reported.


3.1.3 Oxygen conducting ceramic electrolytes. 
An alternative to proton conducting electrolytes are oxide ion conducting electrolytes. The half-cell reactions that occur in a fuel cell configuration, operating with an oxide conducting electrolyte are (Fig. 4b):3H2O + N2 + 6e− → 3O2− + 2NH33O2− →3/2O2 + 6e−
Yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ), is a common oxide-conducting electrolyte comprised of 8% Y2O3/ZrO2. Previously, a double-chamber set-up with a Ag|YSZ|Ru–Pd cell, demonstrated a synthesis rate of 1.5 × 10−13 mol cm−2 s−1 at 650 °C, with steam and nitrogen reactants.72 The synthesis rate increased to nearly 7.5 × 10−13 mol cm−2 s−1 as the temperature increased from 550 to 650 °C. Another study using a symmetric Pt|GDC|Pt cell utilized a more conductive electrolyte, i.e. gadolinium doped ceria (GDC), and achieved a higher formation rate on the order of 10−11 mol cm−2 s−1 at 600 °C.73 The low synthesis rates may be attributed to using water vapor as a hydrogen source. The synthesis rate was shown to increase significantly with the use of hydrogen to 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1 at 650 °C using Ce0.8M0.2O2−δ (doped with M = Gd, La, Y, or Sm).74 However, in this instance the doped cerates acted as proton conductors as opposed to oxygen conductors. Thus, the selection of H2 or H2O as a hydrogen source is non-trivial for both proton conducting and oxide conducting systems. Additionally, the Ce0.8M0.2O2−δ doped cerates demonstrated a positive correlation between the ionic conductivity and the synthesis rate, further emphasizing the need for highly conductive electrolytes. Since oxygen and oxygen anions do not participate in the reaction mechanism for ammonia formation, a higher electrolyte conductivity should not adversely affect the faradaic efficiency. Recently, there have been numerous solid ion conductors discovered that can effectively operate at lower temperatures. Bi2V1.9Cu0.1O5.35 (BiCuVOX) is an example of an electrolyte which can operate at 400 °C with conductivities near 10−2 S cm−1 (Fig. 6).


3.1.4 Nitride conducting molten electrolytes. 
Molten electrolytes are typical eutectic mixtures of alkali chlorides or alkali hydroxides. Common examples of molten electrolytes include eutectic molten chloride salts (LiCl–KCl–CsCl) and eutectic molten hydroxides (NaOH–KOH). Molten electrolytes employed in ammonia electrosynthesis typically have N3− and H+ ions as charge carriers and operate between 200–500 °C.
Nitrogen is a reactant at the cathode and is reduced to nitride ions:N2 + 6e− → 2N3−
Hydrogen is oxidized at the anode and reacts with the nitride ions to produce ammonia:3H2 + 2N3− → 2NH3 + 6e−
Water, methane (CH4), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and hydrogen gas (H2) have all been used as reactants at the anode.111
Recently, a rate of 3 × 10−10 mol cm−2 s−1 at 327 °C was achieved in LiCl–KCl–CsCl molten chloride electrolyte.103 The cell employed a Li–Al anode, Ni cathode, a hematite (Fe2O3) catalyst surface area. The nanoparticles get reduced at the cathode and form an active Fe phase, which results in an increase in the current density (e.g. synthesis rate). While the rate-limiting step in gas/vapor systems is the dissociation of nitrogen, molten salt electrolytes suffer from low N2 dissolution.112 The N2 solubility can be improved via the addition of a nominal amount of an inorganic additive (e.g. Li3N). A rate of 3.3 × 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1 at 400 °C was demonstrated when 0.5 mol% of Li3N was dissolved into a LiCl–KCl–CsCl molten electrolyte.113 Furthermore, when 0.5 wt% of Li3N was added to the LiCl–KCl cell a rate as high as 2 × 10−8 mol cm−2 s−1 at 300 °C.112
Hydroxide molten electrolytes operate at lower temperatures and are less corrosive than molten chloride electrolytes. However, they suffer from low faradaic efficiencies because hydrogen evolution is thermodynamically favorable.114 To suppress hydrogen evolution, it is common to disperse electrically conducting hematite particles (carbon coated Fe2O3) in the molten electrolyte. Carbon-coated hematite particles adsorb onto a stainless steel cathode more easily than that of uncoated hematite; resulting in an increased reduction of the particles to the more active Fe phase for nitrogen fixation. When a nickel anode was used, a synthesis rate of 8.27 × 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1 and faradaic efficiency of 4.9% at 250 °C was observed using a NaOH–KOH molten electrolyte.101Table 1 summarizes the recent performances reported for molten electrolytes.

3.2 Intermediate temperature electrocatalyst and electrodes
Although there are extensive studies on electrocatalyst materials for ambient electrosynthesis, there are significantly less investigations on elecrocatalysts for intermediate temperature electrosynthesis. While material selection for both low and intermediate temperature routes have a similar objective, there are some additional materials challenges when moving toward intermediate temperature systems. Namely, the electrocatalyst's chemical and physical stability at elevated temperatures and the electrocatalyst's chemical compatibility with the solid electrolyte are two significant challenges. Ideal catalyst materials maintain high electronic conductivities and have a minimal activation overpotential for the desired reaction (e.g. nitrogen reduction at cathode, hydrogen oxidation at anode). The catalyst in order to be selective, must also have a high activation overpotential for competing reactions. By having a high overpotential for an undesirable reaction, one can achieve high product selectivity.
Palladium has been demonstrated to be an efficient hydrogen trap that facilitates nitrogen reduction and suppresses desorption and formation of hydrogen gas.63,115,116 The most widely investigated cathode catalyst for intermediate electrosynthesis is AgPd.63,117,118 Rates of ammonia formation ranging from 10−10 to 10−8 mol cm−2 s−1 have been demonstrated for AgPd electrocatalysts and show high Faradaic efficiencies (50-80%) at intermediate temperatures (450–600 °C).31,76,89,91,92,119,120 This differs from thermocatalytic reactors which typically achieve high production rates with Fe and Ru-based catalyst. Theoretical investigations suggest that the most active surfaces for nitrogen reduction are Fe, Ru, Mo and Rh121 and early transition metals (Sc, Y, Ti and Zr) can bind N-adatoms stronger than H-adatoms. Thus, early transition metals that are present in the solid electrolyte (e.g. Zr) may play a role in suppressing side reactions. (e.g. hydrogen evolution). The high activity associated with the AgPd catalyst in intermediate ammonia electrosynthesis is likely due to complex interactions between the metal catalyst and constituents within the solid electrolyte (e.g. Ba, Ce, Zr).
Precious metal catalysts such as Pd, Ag, Ru, and Rh exhibit high electrocatalytic activity towards ammonia and have high electronic conductivity. However, due to cost concerns, there is significant interest in non-precious metal catalysts. Non-precious metal catalysts such as Fe, Mo, Co and Zr are currently being actively examined because of their cost and abundance. One major challenge with non-precious metal catalysts is low thermal stability and ease of aggregation at elevated temperatures.122,123 Noble metal nanoparticles with homogeneity in size, shape, and surface properties are potential catalysts for electrochemical ammonia synthesis by increasing electrochemical surface area (ECSA). However, even noble metal nanoparticles are vulnerable at intermediate temperatures (up to 600 °C), which inevitably lead to loss of ECSA due to aggregation, Ostwald ripening, and sintering.124 Another approach used to diminish catalyst poisoning is to employ barium-type perovskite materials. Recently, Sm0.6Ba0.4Fe0.8Cu0.2O3−δ was used as both cathode and anode and achieved ammonia formation rates of 9.19 × 10−7 mol cm−2 s−1 and 1.53 × 10−10 mol cm−2 s−1 for wet air and wet N2, respectively.125
Bimetallic and/or multi-component catalyst systems provide unique opportunities to tailor the binding energies of reactants, products, and intermediates (e.g. H2, N2, etc.). This level of control can aid in improving synthesis rates and suppressing side reactions. In thermocatalytic production of ammonia, metal promoters (e.g. Ba+) in a Co/CeO2 catalyst surface was shown to be an effective pathway for tailoring intermediate interactions and improve synthesis rate. Using N2 and H2 temperature programmed desorption experiments, it was shown the presence of a small amount of metal promoter (Barium) effectively increased the adsorption of N2 and H2.117 A higher concentration of the metal promoter led to decrease in the H2 adsorption and synthesis rate.117 Furthermore, incorporation of a potassium metal promoter led to decreases in H2 and N2 adsorption and very low synthesis rates. Barium was also shown to be an effective metal promoter on Ru/Sr2Nb2O7 catalyst.126 Thus, metal promoters can effectively change the binding energy of the reactant, but also can affect the catalyst structure and morphological characteristics. Therefore, there are a number of open questions regarding the role that the solid–solid interface play in nitrogen adsorption and activation.
Further attempts to increase the ammonia formation rate without using precious metals has led to the use of bimetallic transition metal nitride catalysts (e.g. CoMoN and FeMoN), which have obtained rates on the order of 10−10 to 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1.44,60,127 The appeal for these catalysts are attributed to their theoretically high activity, ability to suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and relatively affordable costs. These catalysts follow a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, which utilizes surfaces nitrogen atoms and subsequently nitrogen vacancies to reduce gaseous nitrogen.128 Theoretical studies suggest ZrN, NbN, CrN, and VN may be active for nitrogen fixation,129,130 and although recent studies show that they are not catalytically active at ambient temperatures,131,132 these have not been investigated under intermediate temperature cells.
Catalyst activity and electrode microstructure can influence electrosynthesis of ammonia. The membrane electrode assembly utilized for intermediate electrosynthesis of ammonia is comprised of a solid electrolyte sandwiched between two electrodes. The electrode may be the catalyst or a composite material composed of a mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIEC) decorated with an electrocatalyst. The MIEC can provide a porosity to the electrode for effective gas transport while increasing the accessible surface area. Furthermore, the mixed ion electron conductor creates triple phase boundaries within the electrode structure where ion, electron, and reactant transport occurs (e.g. active sites). The structure (e.g. porosity) can be effectively altered via introducing pore formers during the processing step. Common MIECs include Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−α (BSCF) with Fe doping,81 La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−α (LSCF) with Fe doping,83 and Ni–BaCe0.9Y0.1RuxO3 (x = 10, 20) (Ni-BCYR) with Ru doping.133 Dopant materials with high electronic conductivity and activity are desirable. Iron doped MIECs tend to achieve higher formation rates (synthesis rates) than ruthenium-based MIECs when tested under similar operating conditions. For example, a BSCF (Fe-based) electrode81 tested in a wet H2/dry N2 atmosphere near 500 °C achieved ∼8× higher rate of ammonia formation than Ni-BCYR (Ru-based) electrode.88 Similarly, a LSCF (Fe-based) electrode83 showed better performance than a Ni-BCYR (Ru-based) catalyst electrode.133
Molten electrolytes tend to use catalysts that differ from those used in solid state electrolytes. The ammonia electrosynthesis rate in a molten chloride electrolyte was the highest with cobalt and/or nickel catalysts, and the lowest with titanium and iron catalysts.134 The catalyst's wettability and electrical properties within the molten salt greatly impact its performance. Non-wetting catalysts cannot interact with dissolved nitrogen and thus have lower activities. In another study, nickel was implemented as the working electrode and Fe2O3 and CoFe3O4 nanoparticles served as the catalysts.103 Introducing nanoparticles into the molten electrolyte can expand the active sites beyond the nickel electrocatalyst. Specifically, there are active sites between the electrode|nanoparticle and the nanoparticle itself that can serve as active sites for nitrogen reduction.
Therefore, there is a significant need to develop and study catalyst and electrodes for intermediate temperature ammonia electrosynthesis. Catalyst and dopants are needed which are highly conductive and active for nitrogen fixation. Furthermore, the interactions between the catalyst and the solid electrolyte need to be investigated to understanding the role of transition metals within the solid electrolytes. High thermal and mechanical stability are necessary, but structure-sensitive resistance to poisoning should be also considered for long lifetime productions. Finally, cost must be considered when choosing a catalyst, as a large portion of the capitol cost is associated with the nitrogen reduction catalyst and the solid electrolytes.
3.3 Future directions for solid electrolytes and catalyst
Continued progress in this field is dependent on addressing key limitations for these electrochemical cells. Catalysts need to improve their selectivity and activity, but current catalysts are still plagued by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the slow reduction of nitrogen. Both of these limitations could be mitigated by implementing an intermediary for hydrogen and nitrogen on current catalysts. For example, an amalgam of lithium and iron is shown to dissociate nitrogen more effectively than using solely iron and improve the hydrogen surface coverage.135 Additionally, MIECs remain a viable option for improving the activity as long as optimal dopants are chosen. Further enhancement of the MIECs would involve exsolving the dopant and shrinking its particle size during the reduction process, a method previously shown to improve the synthesis rate.133
Oxide ion and proton-conducting materials such as perovskites are one of the candidates for replacement of noble PdAg catalyst. Recently, Fop et al. reported Ba7Nb4MoO20 hexagonal perovskites showed high proton and oxide ion conductivity at 510 °C (bulk conductivity is 4.0 mS cm−1).136 Ba7Nb4MoO20 also exhibited excellent chemical and electrochemical stability. They have discovered several notable ion conductivity of Ba3NbMO8.5 (M = Mo, W). Intermediate temperature (300–600 °C) proton conducting materials have been reported numerous structural families that may contribute to generating ammonia.137–140
Ideally, electrolytes should have high ionic conductivity at elevated temperatures within 100 to 400 °C to minimize the decomposition of ammonia. Currently the most promising electrolytes that fit this criterion are the solid acid electrolytes and the carbonate-based composites. However, multiple ions migrate throughout these electrolytes resulting in a reduced protonic conductivity. Thus, sufficient conductivity and transference number are both desirable. A new type of promising proton conductor is based on lithium super conducting electrolytes (LISICON). A Li13.9Sr0.1Zn(GeO4)4 can undergo ion-exchange in acid to form a proton conductor that has an ionic conductivity above that of many perovskite-structured proton conductors (0.048 S cm−1).45 This indicates that many other alkali-conducting electrolytes may be useful for ammonia synthesis.
4 Measurement issues
4.1 Ammonia measurements
Ammonia is measured using colorimetric assays,141 ion chromatography,142 fluorescence,143,144 ion selective electrodes,145 and H1-NMR spectroscopy.146 Colorimetric methods utilize UV-vis spectrometer to detect indophenol blue dye formed through a reaction between ammonia and chemical reagents (e.g. NaOH, salicylic acid).141 Ionic chromatography utilizes ion-exchange columns to separate ammonium ions from other ions in solutions, and then detects ammonium concentration through a conductivity detector. In fluorescence-based spectroscopy, reagents react with ammonia species to form fluorescence. The ammonia concentration is correlated to the degree of emitted fluorescence.143,144 Ion selective electrodes are type of sensors that convert the specific activity of ammonium ion dissolved in the solution into an electrical potential.145 H1 NMR uses a magnetic field to determine and distinguish the nuclei spin of a proton on ammonia.146
Each measurement method has the propensity to produce a degree of error depending on the testing conditions. One way error can be introduced is if there are signal interferences (ions, transition metals, sacrificial agents). Ions such as PO43−, SO42−, Ca2+, Mg2+ and transition metals such as Ru3+, Ce3+, Fe2+ interfere withe Nesslers' reagent and indophenol blue methods.147,148 Alcohol based species also interfere with Nesslers' reagent resulting an overestimation of ammonia concentration, whereas the presence of alcohol can result in underestimated ammonia concentration with indophenol blue method.147,149,150 Common interferants for ionic chromatography include Li+ and Na+.151 The close retention time among these ions and ammonium leads to separation difficulty, especially when the produced ammonia concentrations are much lower than these alkali ions. Ion chromatography is also very sensitive to concentration, and therefore ammonia can not be easily detected if the supporting electrolyte is high concentration, which is common for aqueous electrochemical systems. Ion selective electrode is sensitive to the presence of alkali and alkaline earth ions, which act as interferences leading to inaccurate ammonia concentration data.152 Certain organic solvent (e.g. acetonitrile, trifluorotoluene) may cause interference with H1-NMR, through peak overlapping. Therefore, it is common to add maleic acid as an internal standard to reduce the peak overlap with H1-NMR.153
Contamination such as adventitious ammonia and NOx also impact the accuracy to each measurement method. Nitrogen gas cylinders often contain trace amount of NOx and/or ammonia which can result in a certain concentration of ammonia which does not arise through nitrogen fixation. To overcome this challenge, acid or copper/ethanol catalyst traps are used prior to the reactor system to minimize contamination.146,154 Nitrogen in plastic tubing, tape, connections, and even the reactor may also introduce contamination. Proton exchange membranes without proper cleaning can also store ammonium through ion exchange process.151 Nitrogen-based and carbon-based catalysts could easily chemisorb ammonia species without repetitive washing prior to the tests.147 Catalysts such as g-C3N4 can deteriorate, resulting in a another potential source of ammonia contamination.147,155 Similarly, the as-prepared Sn(II) phthalocyanine produces false-positives in Ar.8 Therefore, because of the ease of contamination that can occur before during or after the experiments, researchers are rapidly moving forward using isotope labeled gases (N15) coupled with H1-NMR, to distinguish produced ammonia from other ammonia sources.146,153,156,157 Rarely studies on intermediate and high-temperature electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis have utilized isotope labeled N15 to validate the produced ammonia concentrations (Table 1).
Another factor that may lead to erroneous results is pH value of the samples. Indophenol blue methods provide accurate ammonia concentration when the resulted pH after addition of chemical reagents (e.g. 1 M NaOH) are in pH range from 7–13.147,151 In acidic environment (pH = 4–6) the detected ammonia concentration was significantly affected. For Nessler's Reagent, ammonia concentration are accurate in acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions. Though ammonia concentration is not accurate at certain pHs, with appropriate calibration curve, the entirely reliable results can be obtained in the pH range of 1–13 of the samples of nitrogen reduction tests before addition of chemical reagents for both indophenol blue and Nesslers' Reagent methods.153 Ionic chromatography is often deemed the most accurate approach for measuring ammonia, especially in acidic and neutral environments. H1-NMR is deemed to be the most robust method, yet pH can impact H1-NMR as well. It is common to add small amount of acid (e.g. H2SO4) into the samples for measurement because ammonia are stable in acidic media.146,156 However, too low of the pH value may leads to erroneous results. Report showed that the H2SO4 concentration of the final samples in the range of 0.02–0.2 M (ref. 153) would have accurate ammonia concentration data. Other challenges of H1-NMR is the high costs of isotope labeling gas, locking solvents (DMSO-d6) and NMR tubes. A most recent study uses a relative cheaper material (dansyl chloride), faster measuring time (3.5 min) with a more widely used analytical measurement method (mass spectrometer)157 by coupling isotope labeling gas with ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). However, pH value of the samples is still an issue we need to be careful.
4.2 System operating current
One way to eliminate the challenges with measuring ammonia is to generate more product experimentally to minimize error. This can be accomplished through running experiments at higher current density or for longer periods of time. This can aid in moving production values well beyond the limit of detection (LOD) where error is unlikely to play a large role in measurement (Fig. 7). The LOD is defined as the lowest quantitative number of a substance that can be distinguished by absence of that substance.167 The Nessler's reagent LOD is 0.6–1 ppm,168 the indophenol blue method LOD is 0.02–1 ppm,168–171 ion chromatography LOD of 0.01–0.1 ppm, ion selective electrodes LOD of 0.01 ppm, fluorescence has a LOD of 0.01–0.07 ppm (ref. 143 and 144) and H1-NMR has a LOD of 0.05–0.17 ppm.146,153 Typically, most experimentalist are only measuring ammonia concentrations on the order or 1 ppm or less, and are operating with current around 1–5 mA (Fig. 7). Most experimentalist will aim to minimize the volume of electrolyte to concentrate the ammonia faster, but there is a limited volume which one can operate in due to sample volume requirements.

Low temperature ammonia electrosynthesis for the most part remain near or at the LOD (e.g..Ru, CNS,O-etched CNS, MXene and glassy carbon).105,158,159 Some reports are even below the LOD (e.g. γFe2O3, Au-TiO2 nanoclusters, amorphous Au on CeOx/RGO and Au nanorod).160–163 Intermediate temperature ammonia electrosynthesis demonstrations also have reported some data above LOD (Ru/C, PBFCu, Co3Mo3N–Ag, CGDC-carbonate, SSCo-CGDC).38,60,164 However, most intermediate temperature demonstrations also fall near or below LOD (i.e. AgPd, Ag, LSCF, and BSCF).82,96,120,165,166 Due to the interferant ions and unavoidable contamination, it is not ideal to report ammonia concentrations which are near or below the LOD. The clear and easiest way to move beyond the limit of detection is to increase the current and increase the time of the test. Therefore, we advocate for the use of multiple measurements techniques, high current testing, and proper use of statistics to confirm all ammonia measurements.
5 Conclusions and outlook
There is tremendous potential for advances in intermediate temperature ammonia electrosynthesis. The higher temperature operation, opens the door for unprecedented rates of production which may be capable of competing with thermocatalytic approaches. Furthermore, these projected performance values are not attainable with low temperature electrochemical routes. In order to achieve the potential benefits there is a tremendous need to develop intermediate temperature solid electrolytes capable of conducting protons or oxygen-ions, as current solid electrolytes are responsible for most ohmic losses within the cell. Furthermore, there is a need to not only design selective catalyst, but to understand the role the solid–solid interface and interphase may play on nitrogen reduction. Finally, as researchers begin to explore this potential direction, care must be taken to understand what analytical measurement technique are capable of quantifying produced ammonia. Ultimately, all measurements should be corroborated through multiple techniques, and care should be taken to design experiments which move well beyond the limit of detection of each measurement technique.

 	Fig. 1  Ammonia production rate for thermochemical synthesis with an ammonia molar fraction of 1% (a) and 10% (b), and for electrochemical synthesis at ambient pressure with an ammonia molar fraction of 1% (c) and 10% (d). The red line indicates the conditions necessary to obtain a similar rate to the Haber–Bosch process. The red region highlights where the thermodynamic equilibrium prevents the production of ammonia. The figure has three regions (1,2, and 3) representing the three temperature regimes (low ≤300 °C, intermediate 300–600 °C, and high >600 °C). A detailed explanation of the analysis used to develop this figure can be found in the ESI.†	 

 	Fig. 2  Energy efficiency of a low temperature electrochemical ammonia synthesis cell (25 °C), with a reference exchange current density of 10−10 A cm−2, an electrolyte ionic conductivity of 0.1 S cm−1 (Nafion), a electrolyte thickness of 60 μm, and catalyst loading is 1 mg cm−2 (a). Energy efficiency of a intermediate temperature electrochemical ammonia synthesis cell (600 °C), with a reference exchange current density of 10−10 A cm−2, an electrolyte ionic conductivity of 0.014 S cm−1, a electrolyte thickness of 50 μm, and catalyst loading is 1 mg cm−2 (b) red line indicates an achievable energy efficiency for the Haber–Bosch process.
