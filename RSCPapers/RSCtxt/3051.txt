    , Accepted 7th November 2021First published on 9th November 2021AbstractThere are a large number of ionic defects on the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films, which are detrimental to the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Passivating these defects is an effective approach to suppress non-radiative recombination and to improve the efficiency and stability of the perovskite solar cells. Here, an aromatic organic molecule, 4-bromo-benzonitrile (PBBN), is used on (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05-based perovskite films for surface and grain-boundary defect passivation. Theoretical calculation and experimental results indicate that the Pb–I antisite, Pb-cluster, and I vacancy defects can be effectively passivated by the cyano group (–CN) of PBBN, resulting in significantly suppressed nonradiative recombination. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 planar perovskite solar cells based on the passivated perovskite films is improved from 20.09% to 22.28% with reduced hysteresis. Moreover, PBBN treatment also enhances the ambient stability of PSCs. The unencapsulated devices can retain 90% of the initial efficiency after 500 h storage under ambient atmosphere.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using metal halide perovskites as the absorbing layer have attracted extensive research interest due to their eminent optoelectronic performance, for instance, strong light absorption, long carrier diffusion, large defect tolerance, etc. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5% has been achieved for PSCs through crystal engineering, compositional engineering, and passivation engineering.1–4 Also, PSCs can be prepared using a simple low-temperature solution technique, which is promising for realizing a wide range of applications. However, a perovskite film prepared through the solution method is polycrystalline and there are a large number of defects at its surface and grain boundaries (GBs) as well as in its interior.5–7 The defects will cause photogenerated carrier recombination, leading to deterioration of the performance of PSCs.7 Moreover, these defects can cause instability, such as ion migration and moisture (oxygen) permeation, and promote the decomposition of the perovskite.8–12 Thus, reducing defects or eliminating their adverse effects is a prerequisite to achieve high efficiency and good stability of PSCs.
Improving the crystallinity of a perovskite film can reduce its defect density,13–15 and passivating defects with an appropriate passivator can reduce or eliminate their adverse effects.16–29 Defect passivation involves neutralization of the charged ionic defects by a passivator, and it includes bulk passivation and surface passivation. In bulk passivation, defects are passivated during the process of perovskite formation and crystallization by adding a passivator into the perovskite precursor solution.20,21,30,31 Surface passivation is usually accomplished by spinning the passivator solution onto the prepared perovskite films or immersing the films into the passivator solution to passivate the surface and grain boundary defects (also called post-treatment or surface modification).22–26,32,33 Compared with bulk passivation, surface passivation can be more easily carried out with no need to change the fabrication process of the perovskite layer. For example, Jiang et al. used the organic halide salt phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) to passivate the surface defects of the perovskite film and a planar PSC with a high efficiency of 23.32% and a high Voc of 1.18V was fabricated.34 Zhu et al. found that the treatment of perovskite films by 4-tert-butyl-benzylammonium iodide (tBBAI) can prevent unwanted aggregation and accelerate charge extraction from the perovskite layer to the spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport layer, and the efficiency of the corresponding PSC was improved from 20% to 23.5%.35 Our group adopted an ionic liquid, 1,3-dimethyl-3-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate (DMIMPF6), to passivate the surface defects of the perovskite film. The Pb-cluster and Pb–I antisite defects can be effectively passivated through [DMIM]+ bonding with the Pb2+ ion on the perovskite surface, and the solar cell efficiency was improved from 21.09% to 23.25%.36
Defect passivation of perovskite films has been accomplished through the application of various passivators, such as alkaline halides,37 polymers,38–42 organic molecules,14,25,26,30 organic halide salts,34,43 low-dimensional perovskites,44,45 metal halides,19,33etc. Compared with polymers, organic molecules have small volumes, high solubility and good permeability. These make it easier for them to combine and interact with the perovskite. In this work, we applied an aromatic organic molecule, 4-bromo-benzonitrile (C7H4BrN, PBBN), featuring a hydrophobic aryl core with strong electron-withdrawing –CN passivation functional groups, to passivate the surface defects of perovskite films. PBBN exhibits Lewis base characteristics, and the lone electron pairs on the N atoms of –CN on PBBN can passivate the under-coordinated Pb2+ and iodine vacancy surface defects on the perovskite films. The effects of PBBN treatment on the surface morphology and trap state density of the perovskite films along with their photovoltaic performance were investigated systematically. The interaction between PBBN and the perovskite was elucidated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that the PBBN treatment significantly passivated the perovskite defects and reduced the carrier recombination, thereby enhancing the photovoltaic properties of the PSCs. Hence, using PBBN passivation, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the mixed-cation/halide (FAPbI3)0.95 (MAPbBr3)0.05 perovskite film planar PSCs was improved from 20.09% to 22.28% with reduced hysteresis, and the ambient stability of the PSCs was improved as well. This work provides a promising strategy for improving the performance of PSCs via defect passivation by a small organic molecule with the –CN functional group.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows a diagram of the process for preparing (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 perovskite films by the PBBN/CB surface-passivation method. PBBN is used to passivate the miscellaneous defects on the perovskite surface as will be discussed later, and the schematic illustration of the passivation is shown in Fig. 1b. Fig. 1c shows the XRD patterns from the perovskite films treated using different concentrations of PBBN. All perovskite films exhibit characteristic peaks at 2θ = 13.86° and 28.06° from the (110) and (220) crystal planes, respectively, reflecting the formation of the photoactive tetragonal black phase.46–48 There is no new diffraction peak from the treated samples, indicating that the PBBN treatment does not change the perovskite structure. The perovskite films have a preferential (110) plane orientation and a PbI2 characteristic peak with a 2θ value of 12.5° does not appear, which indicated the complete formation of the perovskite phase. The intensity of the main (110) diffraction increases and also its full width at half maximum (FWHM) decreases slightly with PBBN treatment (as shown in Fig. S1, ESI†), showing a small improvement in the crystallinity of the perovskite films.

XRD peaks of the perovskite films processed using PBBN with different concentrations of 0, 6, 8, 10, and 15 mg mL−1 (c). 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to investigate the effect of PBBN on the surface morphology of the perovskite films. Fig. 2a–e show the surface morphology variations of the perovskite films treated using different concentrations of PBBN. It can be seen that the surface morphology of the perovskite after PBBN treatment is different from that of the untreated one. There are cracks and voids in the untreated perovskite film, but the PBBN treated perovskite films are more compact, the grain size is slightly larger and the boundary is more blurred. The average grain size variation with PBBN concentration is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), and the PBBN treatment can increase the average grain size from 1.24 to 1.39 μm. The morphology evolution indicates that PBBN treatment could improve the morphology of the perovskite films. The bigger grain size and fused grain boundary lead to fewer defects, impede ion migration, suppress nonradiative carrier recombination, and improve the carrier collection, and these will improve the efficiency and stability of the PSCs.49,50 There are considerable reports about the grain size increase (secondary grain growth) in the surface post-treatment (surface modification or passivation) of perovskite films. We have demonstrated that some amount of DMSO solvent still remains in the perovskite films.51 We think that the PBBN/CB solution will penetrate the perovskite film through voids and grain boundaries, and CB will dissolve the residual DMSO. During annealing CB volatilizes out of the perovskite film to help the residual DMSO solvent evaporate, and this further promotes the crystallization of the perovskite films.52 The post-treatment with PBBN can postpone the crystal growth upon annealing owing to the interaction between PBBN and the perovskite as will be discussed later, resulting in the enlargement of the perovskite grains. Xue et al. reported surface-induced secondary grain growth, where surface modification induces post-crystallization grain growth in the entire perovskite thin film.53Fig. 2f and g show the AFM images of the PBBN treated and untreated perovskite films. The root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of the perovskite film exhibits a slight increase from 18.5 to 22.2 nm after PBBN treatment.

The optical properties of the perovskite films were studied by UV-Vis absorption measurements. The PBBN treated and untreated perovskite films have almost identical absorption spectra, and their optical band gap does not change significantly (Fig. S3, ESI†), reflecting little effect of the PBBN treatment on their light absorption properties. The effect of PBBN passivation on the carrier recombination of the perovskite films was studied by measuring steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the perovskite films, and the results are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. In Fig. 3a, a sole PL peak located at 790 nm was observed for both the original and PBBN-treated perovskite films, which is coincident with their band gap. The intensity of the PL peaks increases with increasing PBBN concentration from 0 to 8 mg mL−1, then it decreases at higher concentrations. This reflects that PBBN passivation enhanced the radiative recombination and decreased the non-radiative recombination, which indicates that the defects in the perovskite films have been passivated.54Fig. 3b shows the TRPL spectra of perovskite films with and without the PBBN treatment, reflecting the decay profiles of photogenerated carriers. The carrier dynamics obtained by the TRPL measurement provides information on carrier nonradiative recombination induced from the defects in the films. The TRPL spectra were fitted with a double exponential equation: Ft = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + A0, where A1 and A2 are the decay amplitudes, τ1 is the fast decay lifetime (associated with nonradiative recombination), and τ2 is the slow decay lifetime (associated with radiative recombination).55,56 The fitted parameters are given in Table S1 (ESI†). The average carrier lifetime, τave, is calculated as . The τave (= 363 ns) of the PBBN-passivated perovskite films is longer than that of the unpassivated perovskite film (τave = 70 ns). The longer carrier lifetime means less nonradiative recombination, which benefits from the decrease of the defect state density of the surface as well as grain boundaries of the perovskite films through PBBN passivation.57,58

The effect of PBBN passivation on the defect state density in the perovskite films was studied using the space-charge-limited current approach by the electron-type device (FTO/TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag) and hole-type device (FTO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au), and the results are shown in Fig. 3c and d and Fig. S4 (ESI†). Fig. 3c and d show the dark current–voltage curves of the hole-type devices with and without PBBN passivation. The trap density is calculated using the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL): Ntrap = 2εε0VTFL/(eL2), where L is the thickness of the perovskite film, e is the elementary charge, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite, and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity.59–61 The VTFL of each perovskite film was obtained through the inflection point on the I–V curve, which reflects that the trap state is fully filled by carrier injection.62 The Ntrap (hole) values of unpassivated and PBBN passivated perovskite films are 1.02 × 1016 and 9.38 × 1015 cm−3 (Fig. 3c and d), respectively. The trap state densities Ntrap (electron) of unpassivated and PBBN-passivated perovskite films are 8.04 × 1015 and 5.90 × 1015 cm−3, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). The significantly reduced trap state density indicates that PBBN can passivate the defects in the perovskite films effectively.
To investigate the interaction between PBBN and perovskite films, the perovskite films with and without PBBN passivation were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. XPS is suitable for detecting the elemental chemical state changes caused by PBBN treatment. Fig. 3e shows the Pb 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 binding energy peaks, and the Pb 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 peaks located at 143.11/138.27 eV and 143.02/138.16 eV are for the untreated and PBBN treated perovskite films, respectively. Fig. 3f shows the characteristic binding energy peaks of N 1s, and the peaks located at 400.31 eV and 400.39 eV are for the untreated and PBBN treated perovskite films, respectively. Obviously, after PBBN treatment, the Pb 4f peaks moved towards lower binding energies, while the N 1s and I 3d peaks (Fig. S5, ESI†) moved towards higher binding energies, indicating the chemical interaction between PBBN and the perovskite. This interaction was also further demonstrated through FTIR spectroscopy, wherein the cyanide (–CN) bond (2219 cm−1) of PBBN moved to a higher wave number of 2227 cm−1 when it combined with the perovskite (Fig. S6, ESI†).63 The –CN is a Lewis base, and the N atom has a lone pair electron that it can afford the lone pair electron to Pb2+ ions forming a coordinate bond, which passivated the Pb2+ ion defects in perovskite films.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to demonstrate the passivation effect of PBBN on the perovskite. The perovskite structure is simplified as the FAPbI3 perovskite since it is the major component. Both the PbI2-terminated surface and the FAI terminated surface are analyzed. Three typical surface defects are considered, that is, the Pb–I antisite on the PbI2-terminated surface and the Pb cluster and I vacancy on the FAI-terminated surface. The surface passivation mechanism of PBBN toward these defects is illustrated in Fig. 4a, b, and c, and the corresponding density of states (DOS) values of the perovskite with and without PBBN passivation are plotted in Fig. 4d, e, and f, respectively. Comparing the DOS of the Pb–I antisite on the PbI2 surface without and with PBBN passivation, it can be seen that localized states close to the conduction band edge are removed through PBBN passivation (Fig. 4d). For the FAI-terminated surface, the deep states in the forbidden band produced by the Pb cluster are eliminated (Fig. 4e), and the localized shallow states at the conduction band minimum introduced by the I vacancy are reduced (Fig. 4f). These consequences indicate that PBBN possesses multipurpose passivation functions to defect states on perovskite surfaces.

The carrier dynamics in the perovskite films were also studied by time-resolved femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. Fig. 5a and c show the 2D scans of the TA from the pristine and the PBBN treated perovskite films using a 550 nm pump laser. A low laser energy flux (6.85 μJ cm−2) was used to avoid Auger recombination. The ΔA spectra extracted from Fig. 5a and c at definite delay times are shown in Fig. 5b and d, which reveal that the perovskite films have negative transient bleaching from band edge transitions because of state filling. The resumption of bleaching indicates the decrease of the photogenerated carrier densities in the films.64,65Fig. 5e shows the dynamic recovery curve of the transient absorption bleaching peaks. Compared with the untreated perovskite film, the PBBN treated film has a slower decay, which indicates a longer carrier lifetime and lower defect state density in the passivated perovskite film, and the results are consistent with the TRPL measurements.

Planar PSCs were fabricated with the structure FTO/TiO2/(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, and the effect of PBBN passivation on their photovoltaic properties was investigated. Fig. 6a shows a SEM cross-sectional image of the fabricated PSC, and the thicknesses of the TiO2, perovskite, spiro-OMeTAD, and Au films are 50, 530, 100, and 60 nm, respectively. The grains are intimately connected with fused grain boundaries, and they span the entire film thickness, which is conducive to the transport of photogenerated carriers in the perovskite film. Fig. 6b shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the cells passivated with different concentrations of PBBN, and the performance parameters obtained from the J–V curves are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). The untreated cell has a PCE of 20.09% (Voc = 1.065 V, FF = 0.768, Jsc = 24.56 mA cm−2), while a PCE of 22.28% was achieved with 8 mg mL−1 PBBN treatment (Voc = 1.11 V, FF = 0.799, Jsc = 25.09 mA cm−2). Obviously, the increase of PCE is mainly due to the increase of open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). The J–V curves of PSC devices with and without PBBN treatment in the reverse and forward scanning directions are compared in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The hysteresis effect of devices can be greatly reduced by PBBN treatment. As given in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI†), the hysteresis index (HI) of the device passivated by PBBN decreases from 0.057 to 0.029. The decrease of hysteresis benefited from the reduction of trap state density in the perovskite films resulting from PBBN passivation. Fig. 6c and Fig. S8 (ESI†) give statistical information of the parameters of the perovskite solar cells with and without PBBN passivation. The average PCE is increased from 19.3% to 21.6% via PBBN passivation.

The effect of PBBN passivation on the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the PSCs is shown in Fig. 6d. The EQE of the PBBN-passivated device is higher than that of the unpassivated one in the wavelength range of 370 to 760 nm, indicating the increase of photo-generated carrier density. In addition, the integrated photocurrent densities (Jin) of the devices without and with PBBN passivation are 24.1 mA cm−2 and 24.5 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in accordance with the Jsc values of the J–V results. Fig. S9 (ESI†) shows the time-dependent current density and PCE of devices biased at the maximum power point voltage under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G illumination. The current densities and PCEs of the PBBN-passivated device are almost constant with time, exhibiting a good steady-state output characteristic, while they gradually decay with time for the unpassivated devices.
The carrier transport dynamics of the PSCs were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Fig. 6e shows the Nyquist curves of the PSCs without and with PBBN passivation, and the inset shows the equivalent circuit for calculating the electrical parameters by fitting.66 Table S5 (ESI†) presents the series resistance (Rs)/recombination resistance (Rrec) values of the PSCs prepared with and without PBBN passivation, which are 16.63/2213 and 16.64/560 Ω, respectively. Obviously, the Rrec of the PBBN passivated PSC is much larger than that of the unpassivated one. A larger Rrec suggests less carrier recombination, which demonstrates that there are fewer defects on the interfaces and in the perovskite layers. Since the ETL and HTL are the same in the PBBN treated and untreated PSCs, we think the larger Rrec arises from the defect passivation of the perovskite film by PBBN, as studied previously with the XRD, SEM, PL, TRPL, and TA measurements. Thus, defect passivation and reduced carrier nonradiative recombination of the PBBN-treated perovskite film boosted the PCE of the PSCs.66,67
The interfacial contact between the perovskite film and spiro-OMeTAD also affects the performance of PSCs. The energy level change of the perovskite caused by PBBN passivation was studied by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The Fermi level (EF), valence band maximum (EVB), and conduction band minimum (ECB) can be calculated using the equations of EF = Ecutoff (cutoff binding energy) − 21.2 eV, EVB = EF − Eonset (onset binding energy), and ECB = EVB + Eg, respectively. The energy level alignments of the PSCs without and with PBBN treatment are shown in Fig. S9e (ESI†), wherein the EVB level goes up from −5.53 to −5.47 eV and the ECB level from −3.96 to −3.91 eV. PBBN treatment promotes the energy level alignment of the perovskite layer with the hole transport layer spiro-OMeTAD more matching, which is beneficial to reduce the energy loss and enhance hole extraction, resulting in a bigger Voc and FF.

Fig. 6f displays the change of the PCE of PSCs with time under air environmental conditions (25 °C; RH: 30%). It can be seen that the PSC with PBBN passivation has better stability than the unpassivated one. The PSC with PBBN passivation maintained 90% of its initial efficiency, while that of the untreated one decreased to 79% after 500 h storage. The deterioration of the properties of the PSCs is due to fractional disintegration of the perovskite as well as moisture and O2-caused ion transfer.68 Besides, the humidity invades and reacts at grain boundaries more readily.69 The water contact angle on the PBBN-treated perovskite film (81.5°) is larger than that on the untreated one (55.1°) (Fig. S11, ESI†). This indicates that a more hydrophobic film surface was obtained by PBBN treatment. The enhanced hydrophobicity and the reduced defect state density brought about enhanced ambient stability of the PSCs.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated an effective passivation strategy to modify the perovskite film surface by introducing PBBN containing the cyano group (–CN) and investigated its effects on the surface morphology and defect state density of the perovskite films and their photovoltaic performance. The –CN group on PBBN combines with the uncoordinated Pb2+ ion defects on the perovskite, which passivates the surface and grain-boundary defects and suppresses carrier recombination. Consequently, the PCE of PSCs is improved from 20.09% to 22.28%. Moreover, the PBBN-treated perovskite film possesses good resistance to humidity, thereby improving the environmental stability of the device. Under ambient conditions (30% humidity), a passivated PSC retains 90% of its original efficiency after 500 h without encapsulation. This efficient surface passivation based on the organic small molecule PBBN provides a promising strategy to improve the efficiency and environmental stability of PSCs, and it also has great potential for improving the performance of other metal-halide perovskite optoelectronic devices.
