    , Accepted 16th June 2020First published on 17th June 2020AbstractDeveloping non-noble metal-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance. In this study, BiOCl/sulfonated graphene (BOC/GS) composites with adequate oxygen vacancies are fabricated through a hydrothermal method and plasma modification for efficient OER. Controllable generation of oxygen vacancies in BOC/GS is achieved through adjusting the loaded plasma, which is beneficial for the enhancement of electrochemical properties such as conductivity, wettability and dissociation of adsorbates. Furthermore, band structure regulation and high response to visible light are realized in BOC/GS composites, which enables light energy compensation for the electrocatalytic OER process, resulting in reduced overpotential and fast reaction kinetics. Compared with pristine BOC/GS, the overpotential of plasma modified BOC/GS is obviously improved by 270 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec−1. The OER mechanism is investigated from the perspective of photochemistry and electrochemistry, which provides a novel pathway for designing new efficient photo-compensated OER electrocatalysts.
1. Introduction
A remarkable demand for intermittent and discrete energy spawns numerous innovative energy conversion and storage systems, including water electrolysis, fuel cell, rechargeable metal-air batteries, etc.1–5 All of them are simple two-electrode systems with reduction reaction taking place on the cathode and oxidation reaction occurring on the anode, in spite of their complicated module design. Water splitting has been highly valued due to its simple and effective conversion of solar and wind energy into stable chemical bonds, which could be further converted into electricity according to the demand. However, the major hindrance that prevents water splitting from practical application is the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which involves a complex four electron–proton coupled reaction (acidic condition: 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−, alkaline condition: 4OH− → O2 + 2H2O + 4e−).6–8 Although precious Ir/Ru based materials are commonly regarded as excellent catalysts for boosting the OER process, cost-effective non-noble catalysts are more desirable for practical application. Therefore, tremendous efforts have been devoted to explore efficient catalysts consisting of earth-abundant elements.9–11 First row transition metal (TM) oxides, including spinel, oxide perovskites and layered double hydroxides, have been systematically studied, providing deep understanding about the fundamental mechanism of the OER.12–14 In addition, transition metal chalcogenides,15,16 phosphides,17 carbides,18,19 nitrides,20,21etc. have also been reported as promising electrocatalysts for the OER after systematically modulating their 3d electronic structure. The high electrocatalytic activity of TM-based materials is mainly due to the unique 3d electron configurations of TMs, processing empty orbits and/or unpaired electronic orbits, which are conducive to improving oxygen adsorption in the reaction process. Therefore, for TM-based composites, metal centers usually act as electrocatalytic active sites. In addition to TM-based electrocatalysts, some heavier main-group metal element based composites have also attracted certain attention for OER catalysis due to their similar chemical properties to transition metals.22,23 Recently, numerous discoveries have shown that some heavier main-group compounds can behave like transition metal complexes owing to their open coordination sites and unpaired electronic orbits that are energetically accessible, showing potential for small molecule catalysis.24
Bismuth, as a VA group element with the atomic number of 83, has a valence electron configuration of 6s26p3. Compared with transition metals such as Fe, Mn, Co and Ni, Bi is considered as the heaviest, stable and non-toxic metal (Table S1†).25 Moreover, their unpaired electronic orbitals, moderate electronegativity and mild ionization energy enable bismuth-based compounds to have extensive application prospects in electrocatalysis. Bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) is a typical layered compound with [Cl–Bi–O–Bi–Cl] lamellae stacked by the intermolecular force along the c-axis. The unique physicochemical properties of BiOCl make it a promising candidate for photocatalysis,26–30 medicine,31 pigments32 and gas sensors.33 However, BiOCl is rarely considered in the field of electrocatalysis due to its few active sites and poor conductivity induced by its relatively large band gap (∼3.1 eV).34,35 Hitherto, BiOCl based composites have never been systematically investigated as efficient electrocatalysts for the OER. If high performance BiOCl based electrocatalysts could be successfully developed without sacrificing their photocatalytic properties, they will become conceivable to introduce light energy compensation to improve the electrocatalytic performance.
After decades of research, there is still no definite conclusion to elucidate the fundamental kinetic factors for the OER. The major discoveries mainly come from computational researchers, Nørskov and Rossmeisl confirmed that the activity of electrocatalysts for the OER is closely related to the adsorption energies of key intermediates like HOad, Oad and HOOad.36 Therefore, the rational interface design of electrocatalysts is of critical importance to enhance the catalytic performance. Both experimental and computational results suggest that oxygen vacancies are always the most reactive sites on the surface of metal oxides, which usually exhibit stronger binding with water molecules or OH− than normal oxide sites and are extremely conducive to dissociation of adsorbates into highly active species, promoting the electrocatalytic activity.37–39 Moreover, defect engineering on the surface of metal oxide catalysts always results in band structure adjustment, further affecting their photoelectric performance. OER electrocatalysts with good photocatalytic performance are supposed to be beneficial for the generation of key intermediates like HOad, Oad and HOOad due to their photo-induced electron–hole pairs, thus accelerating the OER process. However, the mainstream method of creating oxygen vacancies is reductive pyrolysis, accompanied by morphological deformation and uncontrollable aggregation, and this would eventually result in poor efficiency in the OER. Moreover, the electrocatalytic activities of metal oxides, hydroxides, semiconductors with wide band gaps, etc. turn out to be significantly influenced by their poor electrical conductivity. In consequence, rational and controllable modulation of oxygen vacancies is of great significance to boost electrocatalysts for the OER. Strategically, this issue can be readily solved by generation of oxygen vacancies and introduction of conductive materials like various carbon-based materials, which has been successfully demonstrated by numerous energy storage examples.40–43 Taken together, rational and controllable modulation of oxygen vacancies combined with good electroconductivity should be a promising strategy to design highly efficient electrocatalysts for the OER.
Graphene has attracted great attention in the field of energy storage due to its excellent electroconductivity and high specific surface area and the research on modified graphene is dramatically diversified including corrugated graphene, nitrogen-doped graphene, sulfonated graphene, etc.44,45 Among them, the sulfonic acid group (–SO3H) in sulfonated graphene (GS) is highly hydrophilic, thus improving the dispersion of graphene materials in aqueous solution and the hydrophilicity of composites in electrolyte. In addition, the high electron density of –SO3H facilitates the transfer of electrons from GS to the active sites of metal oxides. Thus, composites of GS with BiOCl can effectively increase the electroconductivity and hydrophilicity, boosting the catalytic performance notably. In this study, BiOCl/GS composites were prepared through a hydrothermal method and nondestructive activation of metal sites could be achieved through plasma-controlled regulation of oxygen vacancies. Highly reactive oxygen vacancies are controllably achieved through DBD (dielectric barrier discharge) plasma treatment. Benefiting from the plasma regulation of active sites and band structures, the overpotential of BOC/GS compounds for the OER is reduced by 270 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with a corresponding Tafel slope of 52 mV dec−1.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of BiOCl/GS composites
Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was obtained after acid leaching of bismite, and other chemicals used were of analytical grade (Sigma-Aldrich) and were used without any further purification. 2 mmol Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 6 mmol KCl were dissolved into 30 mL ethylene glycol (EG) by ultrasonication and are called solutions A and B, respectively. Solution A was dropped into solution B under vigorous stirring for 1 h (the mass ratio between BiOCl and GS is 5:1). Then 0.1 g sulfonated graphene (GS) was added by stirring for another 1 h. The mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, maintained at 160 °C for 12 h, and then cooled down to room temperature. The obtained precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and dried at 60 °C overnight.
2.2 Plasma treatment of working electrodes
Ni foam was first sonicated in acetone, deionized water, 0.5 M H2SO4, deionized water, and ethanol for 15 min in each step and then dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for further use. 10 mg BiOCl/GS powder was dispersed in 200 μL Nafion (0.5 wt% in isopropanol) solution and 800 μL ethanol by sonication for 30 min to form homogeneous ink. Then 100 μL suspension was dropped onto a piece of Ni foam (1 × 1cm2) and dried at 60 °C. The mass loading of BiOCl/GS on Ni foam was 1.0 mg cm−2. For plasma treatment, the as obtained Ni foam was placed in a flat quart cell by DBD in argon. The input power of the discharge was 15, 30, 45, and 60 W and the plasma treatment was performed for 5 min. The as obtained samples are denoted as BOC/GS-15, BOC/GS-30, BOC/GS-45 and BOC/GS-60, respectively, and the raw material is called BOC/GS-p for comparison.
2.3 Structural and chemical characterization
The crystalline structures of the as-prepared products were analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with a D/max-2700 diffractometer (CuKα, λ = 1.5406 Å) in the scanning range of 5–80°. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using FTIR spectroscopy in 4000–400 cm−1 (Nicolet, Nexus 670). The morphologies and structures of the as-prepared samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Tescan MIRA3 LMU). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were carried out on a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI, Titan G260-300). UV-vis diffused reflectance spectra of the samples were obtained using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu, Japan), using BaSO4 as the reflectance sample. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with an excitation source of Al Kα radiation (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Escalab 250, λ = 1253.6 eV). Photoluminescence emission spectra (PL) were acquired using an FLS920 spectrometer. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were obtained using a JES-FA200 ESR spectrometer at 90 K.
2.4 Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were carried out using an Admiral electrochemical workstation (Admiral plus 1147). The OER activity of the as-obtained materials was tested in a three-electrode configuration including a working electrode, a counter electrode (platinum electrode) and a reference electrode (saturated KCl in an Ag/AgCl electrode). The LSV polarization curves were studied in 1 M KOH electrolyte at a scanning rate of 5 mV s−1. The CV curves were tested between −0.1 and 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl. All the polarization curves were corrected by eliminating the iR drop with respect to the ohmic resistance of the solution. All potential data were calibrated on the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale with the following equation: E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.198 + 0.059 × pH.
3. Results and discussion
The schematic diagram of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1a. The BOC/GS composites were obtained through a hydrothermal method, and were further engraved by plasma treatment. The phase structures of the as-prepared samples were first investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 1b). All the diffraction peaks of BOC/GS-p could be indexed to tetragonal BiOCl (JCPDS no. 82-0485). After plasma activation, the diffraction peaks attributed to BiOCl were maintained, proving that plasma treatment didn't change the inherent crystal structure of the material (Fig. S1†). However, there was no diffraction peak belonging to GS in the XRD patterns due to its low amount and poor crystallinity. The existence of GS was identified by FTIR characterization (Fig. S2†). The morphologies of the samples were investigated by FESEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 1c, the pristine BOC/GS composite appeared in the form of uniform 3D quasi-spherical assembly around ∼500 nm in diameter, which was further confirmed to be composed of compact nanoplates (∼20 nm in thickness) according to the magnified SEM and TEM images (Fig. 1e and f and S4†). After plasma treatment, the morphologies and size of the BOC/GS composites exhibited no obvious change (Fig. 1d and S3†), which were further confirmed by TEM characterization. As shown in Fig. 1g, a distinct lattice spacing of 3.425 Å was well labelled, corresponding to the (101) plane of BiOCl. The inset image verified tetragonal BiOCl and the red line indicated the existence of sulfonated graphene. In addition, Fig. 1h shows the TEM image of sulfonated graphene which has the shape of regular tulle about 500 nm. The elemental mapping images under TEM (Fig. 1i–n) confirmed the uniform distribution of BiOCl and GS. The above characterization indicated that plasma engraving showed negligible influence on the crystalline phases and morphology of the BOS/GS composites. However, compared with the pristine sample, plasma treatment enabled the BOC/GS composites remarkably to have improved surface wettability and conductivity (Fig. 2d and f). Surface wettability, determined by the surface chemistry and structure of catalysts, plays a crucial role in the electrocatalytic reaction involved in the release of H2 and O2.46 Preferential dissociation adsorption of water molecules on oxygen vacancies leads to a highly hydrophilic surface of BiOCl, which in turn changes its water adsorption performance and contact angle.47 Therefore, the significantly enhanced surface wettability caused by oxygen vacancies is beneficial for facilitating the permeation of electrolyte, resulting in faster adsorption of reactants and intermediates. In addition, the carrier density (NA) of the BOC/GS composites can be estimated from the following equation (eqn (1)): (1)

The negative slope derived from Mott–Schottky plots (1/C2versus V) indicated the p-type nature of the BOC/GS composites. In addition, the carrier density is inversely proportional to the slope as shown in Fig. 2d, which suggested that the conductivity of the BOC/GS composites enhanced gradually with the incremental concentration of oxygen defects, thus the carrier density involved in the reaction increased. These are of critical importance for improving the electrocatalytic performance of the BOC/GS samples.
Systematic XPS analysis was conducted on the pristine and plasma activated BOC/GS composites to investigate the surface chemical environment changes. Bi, C, O, Cl and S were clearly resolved in the survey spectra without other impurities (Fig. 2a). The high resolution Bi 4f spectra of pristine and plasma treated BOC/GS are shown in Fig. 2b. For the pristine sample, the two characteristic peaks of Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2 located at 165.4 eV and 159.9 eV were clearly observed, corresponding to the Bi3+ in BiOCl.48 However, a negative shift of the two typical peaks took place in the plasma treated sample (159.6 eV and 165.1 eV in BOC/GS-45), implying that the valance of Bi3+ decreased with generation of oxygen vacancies (Fig. S7 and Table S3†).49 The asymmetric O1s main peak was split into four peaks (Fig. 2c). Typical peaks at 527.9 eV, 529.5 eV and 532.7 eV corresponded to the hydroxy species of surface-absorbed water molecules,50 carbon–oxygen and metal–oxygen bonds,50–52 and the high binding energy peak centered at 531.4 eV was attributed to oxygen vacancies induced by plasma reduction of BOC/GS.53 This was consistent with the high resolution Bi 4f spectra. The high resolution C1s and Cl 2p spectra of BOC/GS-45 are shown in Fig. S5.† Furthermore, the oxygen defect concentration was positively correlated with the loaded plasma power (Fig. S6 and Table S2†), which was also confirmed by the low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum in Fig. 2e. Both BOC/GS-p and BOC/GS-45 showed a response at a g-value of 2.002, which could be identified as the trapped electrons on the oxygen defects in the BOC/GS composites. However, BOC/GS-45 exhibited greatly enhanced signal intensity compared to BOC/GS-p, revealing the much higher oxygen defect concentration in BOC/GS-45 induced by DBD plasma.
In addition, the photochemical properties such as band structure, optical absorption wavelength and separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers were also optimized by oxygen defects. The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra characterization in Fig. 3a verified that the absorption of near-infrared light in the BOC/GS composites was enhanced with a concentration increase of oxygen defects, which was in accordance with previous results.54 Specific band structure analysis was discussed below. Moreover, the photoluminescence emission (PL) spectrum and transient photocurrent responses provided strong evidence for the role of oxygen defects. Lower intensities in the PL emission spectrum (Fig. 3c) and higher photocurrent intensities in Fig. 3e indicated more efficient photo-induced charge separation with the increase in the concentration of oxygen defects and longer carrier life which should be conducive to the generation of key intermediates like HOad, Oad and HOOad, thus promoting the OER process. The slight red shift of peaks in Fig. 3c was confirmed to be related to the band structure.55

To illuminate the influence of plasma treatment on electrocatalytic OER performance, linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) tests were applied to the pristine and plasma modified BOC/GS samples at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH solution. The onset potential of the pristine BOC/GS, denoted as BOC/GS-p, was 1.56 V versus RHE, which was much higher than those of the plasma treated samples (Fig. 4a). To reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η10), BOC/GS-p exhibited a quite large overpotential of 766 mV. After 5 minutes of plasma treatment under 15 W, 30 W, and 45 W, the overpotential exhibited a regular decrease, and BOC/GS-45 (5 min of plasma treatment at 45 W) exhibited the lowest overpotential of 496 mV. However, a sharp increase of the overpotential took place when the plasma power further increased to 60 W. In order to eliminate the interference caused by Ni foam, linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) tests were also applied on bare and plasma treated Ni foam. As shown in Fig. 4e, plasma treatment showed little positive effect on the electrocatalytic activity of Ni foam for the OER. Therefore, the enhanced electrocatalytic activity should be mainly attributed to the controllable generation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the plasma treated BOC/GS composites. In addition, plasma treatment also effectively lowered the Tafel slope from 162 mV dec−1 (BOC/GS-p) to 52 mV dec−1 (BOC/GS-45) (Fig. 4b). The comparison of the overpotential and Tafel slope is shown in Fig. 4d. A smaller Tafel slope always suggests a lower overpotential at high current density. The current density of BOC/GS-45 at 600 mV was up to 106.31 mA cm−2, ∼47 times higher than that of BOC/GS-p (Fig. S8†). Furthermore, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of the BOC/GS composites was estimated according to the cyclic voltammetry plots (Fig. S9†). The Cdl of BOC/GS-45 was 4.36 mF cm−2, which was higher than that of the pristine BOC/GS composite (1.32 mF cm−2), indicating that the active surface sites were greatly enhanced after plasma treatment (Fig. 4c). The long-term performance is also a significant index to evaluate an applicable electrocatalyst.56,57 We assessed the stability and durability of BOC/GS-p and BOC/GS-45 at 600 mV vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M KOH solution for 10 h by chronoamperometry. As shown in Fig. 4f, the current density of BOC/GS-45 was almost constant at 600 mV vs. Ag/AgCl during 10 h and remained 106.6 mA cm−2 compared with that of of BOC/GS-p (2.3 mA cm−2). It is worth noting that the current density of BOC/GS-p was also stable during the operation, indicating the strong intrinsic OER stability of the BOC/GS composites. The polarization curves of BOC/GS-45 before and after 500 cycles were almost overlapped, confirming the above results (Fig. S10†). Moreover, we compared the LSV curves of BOC/GS-45 under natural light and dark conditions as shown in Fig. 4g and h, and unexpectedly found that there was a decreased overpotential of about 15 mV under visible light compared to that under dark conditions. The comparison of Faraday efficiency in Fig. S11† suggested that the decrease was unlikely to be attributed to the photocurrent of BiOCl, thereby we speculated that it may be due to the involvement of the photoexcited reactive intermediates of BOC/GS-45 in the reaction. Then we analyzed the band structure of the BOC/GS composites and clarified the possible mechanism as follows.

Fig. 2a shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of all the samples. The optical absorption near the band edge follows the formula (eqn (2)): αhν = A(hν − Eg)n/2(2)where α, h, ν, Eg, and A are the absorption coefficient, Planck's constant, light frequency, band gap energy and a constant, respectively. The band gap energies (Eg) of the BOC/GS composites could be estimated from the plot of (αhν)1/2versus the photon energy (hν) in Fig. 3b. As can be seen in Fig. 3d, the estimated band gap energies of the resulting samples were about 2.85 eV and 2.48 eV for BOC/GS-p and BOC/GS-45, respectively. In addition, the energy level of the BOC/GS composites can be calculated according to our previous study.58
It should be noted that the influence of a trace amount of sulfonated graphene on the X value was not fully considered. However, the relative change of the band structure was reliable. Thus, the Eg, ECB and EVB of all the samples are listed in Table S4.† Taking fully account of the pH effect on band energy, we calibrated the above values with the reversible hydrogen electrode (Table S5†). We intuitively observed that with the increase of oxygen vacancy concentration, the positions of the conduction band and valence band of the BOC/GS composites decreased gradually, that is, the reduction of photoexcited electrons (e−) and oxidation of photoexcited holes (h+) decreased. However, the valence band of BOC/GS was always higher than the oxidation potential of hydroxyl radicals (E(OH−/–OH) = 1.99 eV vs. RHE), indicating that OH− can be oxidized to ˙OH by h+, which is the possible reason for the decreased overpotential. The photochemical properties of BOC/GS accelerated the OER process, so it can be used as a photo-compensated electrocatalyst to promote water electrolysis.
The photo-compensated OER mechanism can be illustrated in Fig. 5 from the perspectives of photochemical and electrochemical processes. The photo-induced carriers, excited by visible light, separated and transferred quickly by GS and oxygen vacancies, thus more holes (h+) could oxide OH− absorbed on oxygen vacancies to *OH (denoted as ② in Fig. 5) and other intermediates (*O and *OOH), resulting in facilitating the OER process. The reaction processes of ②–⑤ are shown in eqn (3)–(6)): M + hν → M(h+ + e−), h+ + OHads− → *OH(3) *OH + OH− → *O + H2O(4) *O + OH− → *OOH + e−(5) *OOH + OH− → * + O2(g) + H2O(l)(6)
 Fig. 5  Possible mechanism in the oxygen evolution reaction of BOC/GS-45. 
An appropriate concentration of oxygen defects could enhance electrical conductivity, wettability and absorption energy of water molecules (denoted as ① in Fig. 5), which optimized the energy of absorbing intermediates, thus significantly reduced the OER overpotential and Tafel slope to 496 mV and 52 mV dec−1, respectively. In addition, oxygen defects could narrow the band gap of the BOC/GS composites, enhance visible light absorption and prolong the life of photo-generated carriers, thus more photo-generated holes could participate the oxidation of OH− to *OH and other intermediates, which was beneficial for promoting the electrochemical performance for the OER. In other words, light energy compensation could further facilitate the OER process.
However, excessive oxygen defects were detrimental for the electrocatalytic activity of the BOC/GS composites. Previous work revealed that the OER depends on the exchange of lattice oxygen species and covalency of metal–oxygen bonds (M–O).59,60 However, excessive oxygen deficiency may lead to a weak covalent bond and a strong ionic bond of M–O, resulting in a small amount of lattice oxygen participating in the reaction and a low reactivity.61 In addition, the excessive concentration of oxygen defects in the BOC/GS composites resulted in the poor oxidizing ability of the valence band, and the concentration of the photo-induced active intermediates would decrease sharply, leading to the degradation of the electrocatalytic performance for the OER.
4. Conclusions
In summary, rational modulation of oxygen defects in BOC/GS microspheres was achieved by hydrothermal and plasma treatment. The OER overpotential decreased from 766 mV to 496 mV and the Tafel slope decreased from 162 mV dec−1 to 52 mV dec−1. The greatly enhanced conductivity, wettability and adsorption/dissociation of adsorbates, triggered by the generation of oxygen defects, should be responsible for the significantly improved the electrocatalytic OER performance of the BOC/GS composites. Moreover, band structure engineering through plasma modification effectively promoted the compensation of light energy for the electrocatalytic OER process. Although the electrocatalytic performance of the BOC/GS composites is still lagging behind those of transition metal-based catalysts, we expand the new application of main group element catalysis and provide a new direction for the selection of photo-compensated OER electrocatalysts.
