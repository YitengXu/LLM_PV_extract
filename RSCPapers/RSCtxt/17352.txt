The catalytic activity of the CuInS2 films based on different precursor concentrations was investigated using electrochemical methods. DSSCs based on optimized CuInS2 thin film as counter electrodes reached a power conversion efficiency of 6.33%, comparable to that of sputtering Pt (6.07%).
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received widespread attention due to their relatively high performance, low cost and easy fabrication.1–3 Generally, a standard DSSC is composed of three key components: a photoanode, an electrolyte containing triiodide/iodide redox couple and a counter electrode (CE). A typical photoanode is a dye-sensitized porous nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2) coated FTO glass. A common choice of counter electrode is Pt deposited FTO glass, due to its great performance as a catalyst for the I3−/I− reaction and the transportation of electrons. However, Pt, as a noble metal, is relatively expensive, seriously increasing the cost of DSSCs and restricting their large-scale manufacture.
Much work has been carried out to search for cheaper substitutes for Pt as active materials in counter electrodes. High catalytic activity for reactions between I− and I3−, good electronic conduction, high surface contact with the electrolyte and a simple synthetic route, such as in situ growth on conductive substrates without any post-treatment4 are preferred characteristics for Pt-free CE materials. So far, carbonaceous materials of high specific surface area (active carbon,5 carbon nanotubes,6 graphene,7,8etc.), conductive polymers,9,10 some transition mental compounds such as nitrides,11 oxides12,13 and carbides14 and various hybrids15–17 have been reported to have the potential to replace Pt. However, the preparation conditions of some materials such as carbides and nitrides are fairly rigorous. Nitride synthesis, for example, always requires high temperatures of over 800 °C and an atmosphere of NH3, which brings great inconvenience for production. On the other hand, the synthesis of sulfides proceeds under relatively mild conditions. Some low-cost and abundant transition metal sulfides,18 such as Ni3S2, Co8.4S8 and Cu1.8S have been reported to have comparable electrocatalytic activity to Pt.
To our knowledge, most materials developed to substitute for Pt are binary compounds. Little attention has been focused on the use of multiple compounds. Xin et al.19 opened the door to the development of multiple compounds as CEs in DSSCs with their freport that quaternary material Cu2ZnSnS4, which is widely applied in the thin film solar cells,20,21 performed with a similar catalytic activity to Pt. However, in Xin’s work, the preparation of Cu2ZnSnS4 was quite complicated and its morphology was not controllable. In DSSCs, the catalytic reactions take place on the surface of the counter electrodes, thus it is credible that the morphologies of catalytic materials will have an obvious influence on the catalytic reactions. CuInS2 is also a popular absorber-layer material for thin-film solar cells. A lot of work has been done to developed different morphologies based on the facile and easy synthesis of CuInS2.22–24 Nevertheless, few reports demonstrate comparable catalytic activity as counter electrodes to Pt in DSSCs. Herein CuInS2 thin films with controllable morphology prepared using a facile process, and are introduced into DSSCs as counter electrodes, where they demonstrate comparable catalytic activity to sputtering Pt.
The CuInS2 thin films were grown in situ on the FTO conductive glass using a solvothermal method without any post-treatment. CuInS2 films C1, C2, C3 and C4 were prepared using different precursor concentrations. CuSO4·5H2O (C1: 0.0025 M, C2: 0.005 M, C3: 0.01 M, C4: 0.03 M), InCl3·H2O (C1: 0.0025 M, C2: 0.005 M, C3: 0.01 M, C4: 0.03 M) and CH3CSNH2 (C1: 0.0075 M, C2: 0.015 M, C3: 0.03 M, C4: 0.09 M) were dissolved and dispersed homogeneously in 10 mL ethanol. The solution was then moved to a 30 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, in which two pieces of cleaned FTO glass were placed diagonally with the FTO side down. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 150 °C for 24 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained film-coated FTO glass pieces were washed with distilled water and ethanol and dried at 60 °C in air.
The morphologies of the CuInS2 thin films were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM images of the in situ grown CuInS2 films are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the CuInS2 films synthesized using a solvothermal method present the morphology of vertically oriented nanosheets. The sizes of the nanosheets increase with increasing precursor concentration. For the C1 precursor concentrations, CuInS2 was spread discontinuously on the FTO glass as clusters of nanosheets (Fig. 1(a)). When the precursor concentration was increased to C2, the nanosheets showed larger sizes and a larger distribution density (Fig. 1(b)). When the precursor concentration was increased further to C3 and C4, the nanosheets showed a graphene like 2D morphology with a large area to thickness ratio (Fig. 1(c) and (d)). The thicknesses were determined using a DEKTAK 150 Profilometer and are summarized in Table 1. According to the thickness parameters, the thickness of the CuInS2 films in this series increase with the concentration of precursor solutions. The thickest film synthesized in the experiment was 1.2 μm thick, and the optimal CuInS2 film was found to be 0.25 μm thick. The results of TEM investigation of the C4 sample are summarized in Fig. 2. The TEM image in Fig. 2(a) shows the graphene like 2D morphology of the nanosheet with a large area. The higher resolution TEM image in Fig. 2(b) shows that the CuInS2 nanosheet is composed of a lot of crystal grains. The lattice spacing of about 0.32 nm can be measured from the HRTEM image (Fig. 2(c)), which corresponds to the (112) lattice plane spacing of CuInS2. Fig. 2(d) shows the electron diffraction pattern confirming that the nanosheet is polycrystalline, which is in accordance with the TEM images.

Fig. 3 shows the typical XRD pattern of the CuInS2 thin film. According to the figure, apart from the peaks of the FTO conductive substrate, it only exhibits chalcopyrite phase (JCPDS 27-0159). The crystallite size and the lattice spacing calculated based on the (112) peak are 0.9 nm and 0.32 nm respectively, which is in consistent with the results from the TEM images.

Fig. 4(a) displays the transmittance spectra of FTO, CuInS2 films C1, C2, C3, C4 and sputtering Pt. According to the transmittance spectra, the CuInS2 films C1 and C2 show high optical transparency (>80% in the visible region) which shows their potential for application as transparent CEs in backside illumination and tandem cells.

(c) and (d) Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and polarization curves of the symmetrical cells fabricated with CuInS2 film C1, C2, C3, C4 and sputtering Pt respectively (with areas of 0.28 cm2). 
The DSSCs were integrated with different CuInS2 thin films or sputtering Pt as the counter electrode. The photoanodes (with thicknesses of 11.7 ± 0.3 μm) were fabricated with commercial TiO2 paste (Solaronix) and sensitized with N719 dye (Dyesol). The current density–voltage (J–V) performances of the cells are shown in Fig. 4(b). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The cell based on the CuInS2 film C1 shows low short circuit current density of 2.37 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of and 33.56%. This is probably because the film is too thin to provide enough catalytic sites for I3− reduction. With the increase in the precursor concentration, the efficiency becomes higher and reaches the highest value of 6.33% with the CuInS2 film C2, which can match the efficiency (6.07%) of DSSCs based on sputtering P; its current density is close to 13 mA cm−2. With a continued increase in precursor concentration, the efficiency becomes lower, which is attributed to the weak conductivity arising from the thicker CuInS2 film.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and polarization curves were employed to further study the electrochemical behaviour of different CuInS2 films and Pt loaded FTO glass using sandwich-like symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical CEs and the same electrolyte in the DSSCs. Fig. 4(c) shows Nyquist plots for the cells made with Pt, C1, C2, C3 and C4. The equivalent circuit is displayed in the inset. The size of the semicircle on the left is consistent with charge-transfer resistance (Rct) between the electrode and electrolyte, inverse to the catalytic activity of counter electrodes. The simulated data from the EIS spectra at high-frequency region are summarized in Table 1. The cell based on CuInS2 film C2 possessed a smaller Rct (1.73 Ω cm2) than that based on Pt (1.98 Ω cm2), which indicates that CuInS2 film C2 has a comparable catalytic activity to sputtering Pt. For CuInS2 film C1, the value of Rct (82.38 Ω cm2) is fairly large due to the thin film which is not able to offer enough active sites. For CuInS2 films C3 and C4 (Rct of 5.23 Ω cm2 and 7.94 Ω cm2 respectively), as the thickness increases, the CuInS2 nanosheets on the surface overlap with the nanosheets close to the FTO substrate, which has negative impact on the electrical conductivity of the film. Therefore, their catalytic activities are weaker than CuInS2 film C2 and sputtering Pt, which is consistent with the J–V performance showed in Fig. 4(b).
The polarization curves of CuInS2 thin films further demonstrates the CuInS2 film C2 exhibits catalytic activity as good as sputtering Pt. For a typical polarization curve, the slope of every curve in 0 V corresponds to the reciprocal of the sum of Rct and Rs. A steeper slope reveals more intense catalytic activity. From Fig. 4(d), the slope of the curve for the symmetrical cell fabricated with CuInS2 film C2 is steeper than others, reflecting a higher exchange current density for CuInS2 thin film C2. CuInS2 films C1 and C4 present very low current even at a large imposed bias, indicating weak catalytic activity for the reaction of I3− and I−. CuInS2 films C2, C3 and sputtering Pt exhibit almost the same limiting diffusion current density (about 32 mA cm−2), revealing the nearly equal diffusion ability of the ionic carriers in the electrolyte.
In this paper, CuInS2 nanosheet thin films were grown in situ on FTO glass via a solvothermal method and were applied in DSSCs as counter electrodes. An optimized concentration of the precursor solution was found and the corresponding CuInS2 thin film exhibits equivalent catalytic activity to that of sputtering Pt. Furthermore, the CuInS2 thin film displays better light transmission than sputtering Pt.
