    AbstractPolymers based upon 2,7-disubstituted carbazole have recently become of great interest as electron-donating materials in organic photovoltaic devices. In this tutorial review the synthesis of such polymers and their relative performances in such devices are surveyed. In particular structure–property relationships are investigated and the potential for the rational design of materials for high efficiency solar cells is discussed. In the case of the 2,7-carbazole homopolymer it has been found that electron acceptors other than fullerenes produce higher energy conversion efficiencies. To get around possible problems with the build-up of charge density at the 3- and 6-positions and to improve the solar light harvesting ability of the polymers by reducing the bandgap, ladder- and step-ladder type 2,7-carbazole polymers have been synthesised. The fully ladderised polymers gave very poor results in devices, but efficiencies of over 1% have been obtained from a step-ladder polymer with a diindenocarbazole monomer unit. Donor–acceptor copolymers containing 2,7-carbazole donors and various electron-accepting comonomer units have been prepared. An efficiency of 6% has been reported from a device using such a copolymer and by suitable choice of the acceptor comonomer, polymers can be designed with potential theoretical power conversion efficiencies of 10%. While such efficiencies remain to be obtained, the results to date certainly suggest that carbazole-based polymers and copolymers are among the most promising materials yet proposed for obtaining high efficiency organic solar cells.

Introduction
The harvesting of solar energy represents one of the best hopes for meeting the ever increasing demands for energy while minimising the emission of greenhouse gases which threaten to induce potentially catastrophic changes in the world's climate. Current solar cell technology relies upon silicon, the processing of which is both relatively expensive and environmentally problematic. The use of solution processable organic materials, whether small molecules or polymers, as active materials in solar energy devices offers great potential for reducing their price and environmental impact. In addition such materials could be used to make flexible large area devices, which are not feasible with silicon-based cells.
The main factors that have so far prevented the use of organic solar cells are their significantly lower power conversion efficiencies and lifetimes than current silicon-based cells. To become commercially viable it is currently estimated that organic solar cells will need to have power conversion efficiencies of at least 10%, and lifetimes of several years, while having production costs much lower than for silicon.1
The first relatively efficient (power conversion efficiency of 1%) organic photovoltaic device (OPV) reported by Tang2 used vacuum-deposited layers of an organic donor and acceptor molecule, in a bilayer structure similar to that found in silicon-based devices. A major disadvantage of this structure is that only those excitons generated within ca. 10 nm of the interface between the layers can be split to form charges, thus reducing the potential power conversion efficiency. Also the vacuum deposition techniques used to deposit the active layers in such cells are more expensive than solution processing methods such as spin-casting and are not suitable for fabricating large area devices. More recently the focus of research into OPVs has been into devices containing solution processable conjugated polymers as the active materials.3 These devices contain a bulk heterojunction (BHJ, Fig. 1) structure first developed independently by groups at Cambridge4 and at Santa Barbara,5 who deposited from solution a blend of an electron-donating polymer and an electron-accepting polymer to produce a single active layer containing a bulk heterojunction between the two components. Among the perceived advantages of BHJ over bilayer devices are that their potential efficiencies are much higher as a much greater proportion of the excitons (in principle up to 100%) can be split to produce charges for collection at the electrodes, while the deposition of the active layer by solution processing will lower production costs, and permit fabrication of large area devices even upon flexible substrates. The possibility of using high throughput printing techniques for depositing the active (and possibly other) layers of devices is particularly attractive from an industrial point-of-view.6–8

While polymers were used as the electron acceptor in the first BHJ devices,4,5 it was soon found that use of molecular acceptors such as fullerenes produces higher efficiencies,9 and such polymer-molecular acceptor BHJs are now the most widely studied active layers in OPVs.3 The most widely used acceptors have been fullerene derivatives, as these are particularly good acceptors and generally produce the highest efficiencies in devices. It has been known since 1992 that electron transfer to C60 (1, Fig. 2) can efficiently quench the fluorescence of conjugated polymers.10 Due to the low solubility of unsubstituted fullerenes, fullerenes with solubilising substituents such as PCBM (2) are generally used. Ultrafast spectroscopic techniques have shown that electron transfer from a conjugated polymer to PCBM occurs in the femtosecond range, which is faster than the recombination by several orders of magnitude.11 This is important as recombination is one of the most significant mechanisms for lowering the efficiency of OPVs, and this slow recombination rate combined with efficient electron transfer away from the interface due to rapid electron hopping between fullerenes assists in increasing the overall device efficiency due to the much improved charge collection. It has been found that the use of fullerene derivatives of C70 rather than C60 leads to better OPV performance, due to the stronger absorption of the former in the visible region.12 Despite this, PCBM is still widely used, especially for initial testing of donor materials, due to its significantly lower cost and more ready commercial availability compared to the C70 analogue PC71BM (3). (It should be noted that while strictly speaking compound 2 should be named PC61BM, it is usually called simply PCBM, except where confusion with 3 is possible, a convention that will be followed in this review.)

As PCBM is a poor absorber of solar radiation, in order to get efficient light harvesting, low bandgap polymers (Fig. 3) are used as the donor materials. These can be homopolymers such as P3HT (4, bandgap 2.1 eV) but most low bandgap polymers contain an internal donor–acceptor pair, e.g. PCPDTBT (5, bandgap 1.73 eV).13 Considerable insights have been gained into the optimisation of polymer–fullerene blends to obtain maximum energy conversion efficiency through controlling the microscopic morphology by techniques such as thermal annealing.1,3,14–16 Cells with efficiencies of over 5% have been obtained using blends of fullerenes with both P3HT3 and PCPDTBT.17
 Fig. 3  P3HT and PCPDTBT. 
The task of designing new materials for use in BHJ OPVs has been greatly assisted by the development by the Konarka group in Austria of a model for predicting the maximum potential efficiency of donor–acceptor blends in such devices.1,18 As shown in Fig. 4, this model predicts that 10% power efficiency is possible for a single layer BHJ cell with fill factor (FF) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.65, using a donor with a bandgap between 1.2 and 1.8 eV and whose lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is around 0.3 eV higher in energy than that of the acceptor.1 For PCBM as acceptor (LUMO = −4.3 eV) this corresponds to a donor with a LUMO energy close to −4.0 eV and a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level between −5.2 and −5.8 eV.18 It also shows that the potential efficiency of cells using blends of PCBM with P3HT or PCPDTBT is below 7%, spurring a search for new polymers.

One problem with organic solar cells is that no organic molecules are known which efficiently absorb right across the entire solar spectrum so that much of the incident solar radiation is unharvested. One way to overcome this problem is to use so-called tandem cells in which two (or more) solar cells are stacked on top of each other with a transparent interlayer.19 One cell (usually the top one) contains a blend which absorbs most strongly at short wavelength, while the other contains a blend which absorbs most strongly at longer wavelength. In this way the total absorption of the incident light is maximised and the overall voltage and energy efficiency is higher than for either cell. The Santa Barbara group have fabricated a tandem cell with PCPDTBT–PCBM and P3HT–PC71BM cells which displayed an efficiency of 6.5%, making it the most efficient polymer-based solar cell yet reported.20 The Konarka group have developed a model for predicting the maximum possible efficiency of tandem cells from which, as shown in Fig. 5, they predict that efficiencies of over 14% are possible from such devices.1,21

One class of polymers that has, somewhat unexpectedly, become of great interest recently as donor materials for BHJ solar cells are carbazole-based polymers. While carbazole-based polymers have been known for some time, and have found applications in devices such as light-emitting diodes,22 the first report of a polycarbazole as donor in a BHJ solar cell only appeared in 2006.23 While the efficiency of that device was modest, the HOMO energy levels for carbazole-based polymers are typically in the −5.2 to −5.8 eV range mentioned above as being necessary for donors in high efficiency BHJ cells with fullerenes. This suggests that carbazole-based polymers with appropriate bandgaps might well prove to be extremely good donor materials in BHJ cells, which possibility was reinforced when a device using a carbazole-copolymer as donor was the first polymer solar cell to achieve a power conversion efficiency of above 6%.24 While there have been reviews on carbazole-based polymers for other applications,22,25,26 there has to date been only partial reviews on their use as donor materials in BHJ solar cells.27,28 In this article we aim to correct this deficiency by showing how carbazole-based polymers have been produced for use in solar cells and how rational synthetic design has been used to improve their performance. To begin however, we must first examine the chemistry of carbazole and the methods available for making such polymers.
The synthesis of carbazole-based polymers
Carbazole (6, Fig. 6) is a nitrogen-bridged biphenyl isoelectronic to fluorene (7), so that poly(2,7-carbazole)s (8) are isoelectronic to poly(2,7-fluorene)s (9). Polyfluorenes have been intensively investigated due to their great potential as blue-emitters in polymer LEDs.22,29–33 In view of the electron-donating effects of the nitrogen the polycarbazoles 8 possess higher HOMO energy levels than the polyfluorenes, which can improve their charge injection and transport properties. Because of these properties, oligomers and polymers based on nitrogen-bridged phenylenes such as carbazole have been investigated as materials for optoelectronic applications such as transistors and LEDs.22,31–34 Polycarbazoles 8 are of particular interest as blue-emitters for LEDs since, unlike polyfluorenes, they cannot produce green-emitting ketone defects through oxidation. However, the electronic effects of the nitrogen atom make the chemistry of carbazole and fluorene very different. Whereas the favoured sites for electrophilic attack on fluorene are the 2- and 7-positions, in carbazole they are the 3- and 6-positions, followed by the 1- and 8-positions. As a result whereas poly(2,7-fluorene)s, which are fully conjugated along the backbone, are readily accessible via oxidative polymerisation of fluorenes or transition-metal mediated organometallic cross-coupling of 2,7-substituted fluorenes, poly(2,7-carbazole)s cannot be made starting from carbazole. From carbazole the most accessible polymers are poly(3,6-carbazole)s (10), which can be readily obtained either by oxidative polymerisation of carbazoles or by organometallic cross-coupling reactions of 3,6-disubstituted carbazoles.25 It is also possible starting from carbazole to make polymers with 3,9-carbazole (11)25 or 1,8-carbazole (12) units.35 The problem with polymers containing such units is that the conjugation goes through the nitrogen which is less efficient and so they have very large bandgaps, meaning they can absorb only a small fraction of the incident solar energy. Perhaps as a result there has been no reported investigation of them as donors for solar cells, though copolymers containing such carbazole units have been made which might be suitable due to their smaller bandgaps.36
 Fig. 6  Carbazole and fluorene and their polymers. 
Poly(2,7-N-alkylcarbazole)s (8, R = alkyl) can be made by Suzuki or Yamamoto coupling of 2,7-dihalo-N-alkylcarbazoles. As mentioned above, these monomers cannot be made directly from carbazole and so have to be totally synthesised. The first efficient route to them was reported by Morin and Leclerc (Fig. 7), who used a Suzuki reaction between 4-chlorobenzeneboronic acid (13) and 4-chloro-3-nitrobromobenzene (14), which occurred selectively at the more reactive bromide site to give 2-nitro-4,4′-dichlorobiphenyl (15). Reductive ring-closure with triethyl phosphite followed by alkylation then produced N-octyl-2,7-dichlorocarbazole (16) in good overall yield.37 This monomer could be used in a Yamamoto polycondensation to make the homopolymer but is not suitable for use in Suzuki polycondensations to make alternating copolymers due to the low reactivity of chlorides in Suzuki reactions. The more reactive dibromide (17) is required for such polymerisations.
 Fig. 7  Leclerc synthesis of 2,7-dichlorocarbazole. 
An efficient route to 2,7-dibromocarbazole (Fig. 8) was developed at Mainz involving nitration of commercially available 4,4′-dibromobiphenyl (17) followed by reductive ring-closure.38 Recently it has been shown that the ring-closure can be achieved more efficiently (75% cf. 56% yield) using triphenylphosphine.39 By this method 17 can be readily synthesised in multigram quantities. After N-alkylation to give 18 substituents can be introduced into the 3,6-positions of dihalocarbazoles by standard electrophilic substitution reactions, for example to make the dibenzoyl compound 19.38
 Fig. 8  Synthesis of 2,7-dibromocarbazole derivatives. 
The N-alkyldibromide 18 is readily converted into the bisboronate 20, which has been used in Suzuki cross-coupling reactions to prepare copolymers of 2,7-carbazoles with a variety of aryl and heteroaryl comonomers (Fig. 9).40,41 The carbazole homopolymers 8 possess large bandgaps of ca. 3 eV, similar to those of polyfluorenes (9) and so are blue emitters which absorb in the deep blue and higher energy parts of the spectrum. By suitable choice of comonomers copolymers with much smaller bandgaps (<2 eV) can be made. Most commonly a dithienylheteroaromatic comonomer is used as the acceptor part of a donor–acceptor copolymer.
 Fig. 9  Synthesis of carbazole–aryl alternating copolymers. 
One important difference between polycarbazoles and polyfluorenes is that the latter have twice as many solubilising substituents per monomer unit. As a result, polycarbazoles tend to have significantly lower solubility than polyfluorenes with the same alkyl substituents, which reduces the molecular masses of materials obtained by solution polymerisation. This problem can be overcome by using long branched alkyl sidechains.23,42 It has also been reported that N-alkylcarbazoles are not very stable under UV light as radical cations are formed which are stabilised by the nitrogen atom. This may be overcome by replacing the alkyl groups with aryl substituents.27,43 As the 3- and 6-positions are favourable sites for oxidation, blocking these may also be expected to assist in stabilising 2,7-carbazoles. Simply substituting these positions would induce twisting between adjacent carbazole units in a polymer due to steric interactions between the substituents, shortening the conjugation length and increasing the bandgap. This is undesirable as it reduces the amount of solar radiation which the polymer can absorb. A way to simultaneously block the 3,6-positions and reduce the bandgap, so increasing the absorption range, is to make a ladder-type polycarbazole (21, Fig. 10) in which adjacent units are connected by methylene bridges to produce a rigid, planar polymer. It is known from bridged phenylene-based polymers that increasing the amount of bridging causes a bathochromic shift in the polymer absorption.31–33
 Fig. 10  Synthesis of a ladder-type polycarbazole. 
The ladder-type polymers 21 has been made via the precursor polymer 22, obtained by Suzuki polycondensation of 19 and 20.44 Treatment of 22 with methyl lithium followed by ring-closure with a Lewis acid produced 21 through an intramolecular Friedel–Crafts reaction at the electronically favourable 3- and 6-positions. The ladder structure was confirmed by UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy which showed a very small Stokes shift and a sharp absorption edge characteristic of a ladder polymer. The polymer was found to aggregate strongly in solution which produced concentration-dependent spectra, with almost featureless emission spectra at high concentrations, which changed to sharp well-resolved spectra at low concentrations. This behaviour arises because the bulky aryl substituents are on only one side of the polymer chain and so cannot suppress aggregation. The bandgaps of the ladder polymers 21 are significantly smaller than 8 with an absorption edge around 470 nm (2.65 eV), so that they display green rather than blue emission. One problem with the ladder polymers is that their solubility is lower than the single chain polymers 8 due to their more rigid structure.
Polymerisation of the dibenzoylcarbazole 19 followed by ring-closure with B2S3 gave the ladder-type polymer 23 (Fig. 11).44 The final reaction was incomplete as shown by observation of a residual ketone carbonyl stretch in the infrared absorption spectrum, probably because the reduced solubility of 23 caused the product to start precipitating from the reaction medium before the reaction was complete. A ladder-type carbazole–phenylene copolymer 24 has been prepared by a similar method to that used to make 21 but involving Suzuki coupling of a carbazole-bisboronic acid 20 with a dihalodibenzoylbenzene.45 These polymers display similar spectral properties to 21 but without any evidence for aggregation, due to the helical nature of 23 and the presence of aryl groups on both sides of the main chain in 24.
 Fig. 11  Other ladder-type carbazole polymers. 
Polymers in which only some of the carbazoles are bridged, the so-called ‘step-ladder polymers’, have absorption spectra intermediate between 8 and 21, while having better solubility than the fully ladder-type polymers. The first such polymer to be made was a poly(diindenocarbazole) 25.46 The monomer was prepared by Suzuki coupling of 19 with a bromobenzoate followed by addition of an aryllithium and ring-closure, and polymerised by the Yamamoto method (Fig. 12).
 Fig. 12  Synthesis of poly(diindenocarbazole). 
The bridged hexaphenylene monomers 26 and 27 have been prepared by similar routes involving coupling of 19 with, respectively, the chlorofluoreneboronate 28 and the chlorocarbazole-boronate 29.27,32 Coupling of 29 with 2,5-dibromoterephthalate has been used to make the pentaphenylene monomer 30.27 These monomers have all been successfully polymerised by the Yamamoto procedure to give polymers 31–33 (Fig. 13) with bandgaps between 2.7 eV and 2.85 eV.
 Fig. 13  Other carbazole-based step-ladder polymers. 
Oligophenylenes bridged with nitrogen atoms can be thought of as bridged oligoanilines and there has been some interest in such compounds and their polymers as materials for transistors.32,34 There are some considerable problems encountered in their synthesis as exemplified by the synthesis of dihaloindolocarbazoles (Fig. 14). Reductive ring-closure of dinitroterphenyls gives a mixture of regioisomers 34 (35%) and 35 (6–8%), and the same problem is encountered in routes starting from carbazole.47 This can be avoided by using a double Fischer indolisation reaction with the desired monomers 36 being obtainable in good yield by acid treatment of the bishydrazides 37.48 To overcome similar problems in the synthesis of dihalodiindolocarbazoles 38, the ring-closure had to be performed by an internal Ullmann coupling of the terphenyls 39.47 Homopolymers have been prepared by Yamamoto condensation of the monomers 36 and 38.47,48 The absorption spectra of poly(diindolocarbazole) are strongly bathochromically shifted (by ca. 60 nm) compared with the poly(indolocarbazole)s. The polymers of 36a and 38a with full conjugation along the chain show much stronger absorption on the visible part of the spectrum than those obtained from 36b and 38b, which absorb almost entirely in the ultraviolet.47 Copolymers of indolocarbazoles have been prepared by Suzuki polycoupling of the diboronates derived from 36a and 36b with dibromoarenes.49 By appropriate choice of comonomer polymers with bandgaps below 2 eV have been made.

Performance of carbazole-based homopolymers in solar cells
Poly(N-alkyl-2,7-carbazole) (PCz, 8, R = 2-decyltetradecyl) has HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.6 eV and −2.6 eV.23 The ladder-type polymer 21 has orbital energies of −5.4 and −2.9 eV,44 with the step-ladder polymers 25–27 having values intermediate between those for 8 and 21. All these polymers are thus suitable donors for PCBM (−6.0 eV/−4.3 eV) and other acceptors such as PDI (40, Fig. 15) (−5.8 eV/−3.8 eV)23 and vinazene 41 (−6.0 eV/−3.5 eV).50,51
 Fig. 15  PDI and vinazene acceptors for PCz. 
PCBM was found to be not as good as PDI as an acceptor with PCz, as it shows much less absorption in the visible part of the spectrum, with the PCBM–PCz blends absorbing strongly only at wavelengths below 450 nm, whereas the blends with PDI show strong absorption down to 600 nm.27 As a result the maximum power efficiency of devices using PCBM as acceptor was only 0.07%,27 whereas values of over 0.5% were obtained from blends of PCz and PDI.23 The highest efficiency of 0.63% was obtained from a blend containing 80 wt% of PDI. The maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 16% (corresponding to a power efficiency of 3%) was obtained at 490 nm which is the absorption maximum for PDI. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) was about 0.7 V for all blends tested, but the short-circuit current (Isc) increased from 57 µA cm−2 to 264 µA cm−2 as the PDI ∶ PCz ratio increased from 1 ∶ 1 to 4 ∶ 1. Blends with higher PDI content formed poor quality films due to crystallisation of the PDI. Annealing was found to improve the performance for blends with lower ratios of PDI, but not for high acceptor ratios, due to the formation of larger PDI crystals with improved percolation pathways. At high PDI ratios these pathways already exist before annealing. Recently the vinazene 41 has been shown to be an even better acceptor for a PCz donor, with a power conversion efficiency of 0.75% being obtained from a blend with 70% of acceptor after annealing.50,51 The Voc of 1.36 V, and Isc of 1.14 mA cm−2 were both superior to the values obtained using PDI.
The ladder-type polycarbazole 21 (R = 2-decyltetradecyl) gave very disappointing results when tested as an acceptor in solar cells with PDI. The efficiency from a cell using 60 wt% of PDI was only 0.09% with a maximum EQE of only 6% (cf. 16% for 8). From the low Isc (3.58 µA cm−2) and fill factor (FF, 0.13), and the shape of the I–V curve it appears this is due to poor charge transport.52
Blends of polymers 25, 31 and 32 with both PCBM or PDI produce higher efficiencies than were seen using PCz as donor.27,52 The values for the devices using 80 wt% PCBM are tabulated in Table 1 with the values for PCz 8 given for comparison. The device parameters except for Voc are all significantly superior for the step-ladder polymers 25–27 than for the polycarbazole 8.

Problems were encountered with the film quality for blends of polymers 25, 31 and 32 with PDI. Blends with more than 67 wt% of PDI with 25 and 31, or more than 50 wt% with 32, gave films that were too poor to be used in devices. The device parameters for the best devices using blends of 25, 31 and 32 with PDI are tabulated in Table 2 with the values for 8 being given for comparison.52 The efficiencies obtained from these cells are among the highest values yet recorded for a polymer-based BHJ cell not using a fullerene acceptor. Contrary to what is usually observed for polymer-based BHJ devices, it was observed that annealing of the devices using 25, 31 and 32 resulted in marked drops in efficiency, with significant deterioration in both Voc and Isc. This is due to the poor film-forming properties of the blends which become uneven in thickness on heating due to crystallisation of the PDI, leading to charge transport problems.

In order to understand these results a correlation was sought between the degree of solid-state packing of the polymers and their device efficiencies. The macroscopic order of the polymers was investigated by wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) studies on extruded fibres.27,52 These showed that all the polymers displayed efficient packing with p-stacking distances of 0.45–0.48 nm, and interchain lateral distances between 1.51 nm for 31 and 2.36 nm for 8. Polymer 31 showed the highest degree of order with 25 and 32 being only slightly less well-ordered. The relatively low degree of order in 8 probably reflects the very long alkyl chains required to obtain solubility, which increase the distances between the polymer chains. For the blends with PCBM it thus appears there is a good correlation between the solid-state order of the polymers and the device efficiencies. No such correlation can be seen for the blends with PDI where the picture is dominated by the problems with film-forming. The exceptionally high results obtained from 25 with PDI look anomalous and deserve further investigation. They may reflect a fortuitous organisation of donor and acceptor in the unannealed blend. As the device parameters decay significantly upon annealing one suspects that prolonged irradiation with its consequent heating would lead to rapid deterioration in the device performance.
To date the performance of polymers 25, 31 and 32 with other acceptors such as PC71BM (3) or vinazene 41 has not been reported. It is noteworthy that the performance of the polymers 25, 31 and 32 does not show the marked improvement upon changing to non-fullerene acceptors observed for 8. This may be due to the greater overlap in absorption spectra between these polymers and the PDI. As these polymers display significantly red-shifted absorption spectra compared to 8, one might hypothesise that using a smaller bandgap acceptor than PDI would prove advantageous.
Because of their large bandgaps carbazole-based homopolymers cannot attain high efficiencies in BHJ devices, but their study can provide useful insights into structure–property relationships. Copolymers with suitable comonomer units would have much lower bandgaps and much higher potential photovoltaic device efficiencies, and so it is to these we now turn.
Performance of carbazole-based copolymers in solar cells
Most of the published work on carbazole copolymers for BHJ solar cells has come from the group of Leclerc. They have prepared a range of donor–acceptor copolymers by Suzuki polycoupling as shown in Fig. 9 above. The most successful of these materials to date has been the copolymer 42 with dithienylbenzodithiazole as the acceptor unit.53 This has a small bandgap of 1.9 eV with HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.5 eV and −3.6 eV. The first reported devices using 80 wt% of PCBM as acceptor displayed good device parameters: Voc of 0.89 V, Isc 6.92 mA cm−2, FF 0.63 and efficiency of 3.6%.53 These devices were later optimised by varying the donor–acceptor ratios, molar mass and polydispersity of the polymer, and the active layer thickness to achieve efficiencies initially of up to 4.35%,54 and subsequently of up to 5.2%.55 Replacement of PCBM with PC71BM 3 as acceptor produced even higher efficiencies of 5.7%.55 Introduction of a titanium dioxide optical spacer/hole blocking layer led to a final optimisation to achieve devices with 6.1% external power efficiency.24 As mentioned in the introduction these were the first organic BHJ devices to achieve greater than 6% power conversion efficiency. The Voc (0.88 V) in the optimised devices is unchanged from the earlier ones and the FF (0.66) is only slightly higher but the Isc is much enhanced to 10.6 mA cm−2. These devices display almost 100% internal quantum efficiency and the obtained efficiency closely matches the maximum efficiency predicted by the Konarka model (see Fig. 17 below). This shows that other acceptor moieties need to be incorporated into carbazole copolymers if the much-sought after 10% efficiency is to be attained.
To this end the Leclerc group designed and synthesised a series of copolymers 43–47 (Fig. 16) containing a variety of other electron-accepting heteroaromatic moieties, and after determining their orbital energy levels and bandgaps, used the Konarka model to calculate their maximum potential efficiency in solar cells with PCBM as acceptor (Fig. 17).56

As can be seen all these polymers are in theory capable of producing cells with at least 5% efficiency, with 10% being predicted for polymer 47. Unfortunately, as shown in Table 3, the actual values obtained for all the polymers except 42 fell well short of these theoretical maxima.56 (The values given for polymer 42 in Table 3 are those reported from the unoptimised devices used in ref. 56, not the subsequent results from optimised devices.) This shows that while having the correct orbital energy values may be a necessary condition for obtaining high efficiency it falls well short of being a sufficient condition. The reason for this lies in the organisation of the polymers in the solid state. To avoid losses through recombination in blends with PCBM, a hole mobility in the donor polymer of at least 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 is considered necessary.18 As can be seen from Table 3 only polymer 42 meets this requirement. It is noteworthy that the “symmetrical” polymers 42, 43 and 46 all display better efficiencies than their corresponding “unsymmetrical” polymers 45, 44, and 47, even though the latter have the higher potential efficiencies. The mobility and Isc values correlate well with the degree of structural order seen in thin films of the polymers by X-ray diffraction and other analysis. This matches the pattern seen for the carbazole-based homopolymers discussed above where the efficiencies of blends with PCBM in solar cells correlated well with the degree of structural order seen in WAXS experiments. One reason for the very low efficiency of devices using polymers 45 and 47 may be that their molar masses were very low (4–5 kDa); low molar mass is known to reduce charge carrier mobility and current values in polymers, but it is dubious if improvement in their molar mass would be sufficient to improve the device efficiencies to anywhere close to the potential values. Of these materials, only 46 currently looks like it might be capable of matching 42 in performance if further optimisation were performed.

An approach that is worth consideration is to alter the electronic properties of the acceptor unit by substitution. The only example of this published to date is a copolymer 48 containing a dialkoxybenzodithiazole unit.57 This has similar electronic properties to polymer 42 with an unsubstituted benzodithiazole unit. The bandgap of 1.95 eV matches the value of 1.9 for 42 but the HOMO and LUMO orbital energies of −5.21 and −3.35 eV are slightly higher. Devices using 48 as donor with PC71BM 3 as acceptor produced Voc 0.81 V, Isc 9.6 mA cm−2, FF 0.69, and efficiency of 5.4%. These values are very similar to those obtained from devices using 42. The mobilities measured for the blend in FETs were 1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes and 3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons indicating well balanced charge transport. One advantage of attaching the alkoxy groups to the acceptor unit is that smaller alkyl chains are needed on the carbazole to achieve good solubility. It may also be possible to optimise chain packing by varying the lengths of the alkyl chains on the two units (Fig. 18).
 Fig. 18  Carbazole copolymer with substituted benzodithiazole. 
Recently, low bandgap copolymers 49 (Fig. 19) with diketopyrrolopyrrole units have been prepared independently by the Leclerc group (49a)58,59 and by Hashimoto and co-workers (49b).60 The hole mobility in 49a measured in a transistor was 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1, indicating it has excellent charge transport properties. The optical bandgaps estimated from onset of absorption are reported to be 1.57 eV for 49a,59 and 1.63 eV for 49b. Inspection of their solid-state UV absorption spectra suggests this difference is due to a long wavelength tail in the spectrum of the former, possibly due to aggregation. Polymer 49a has a lower molar mass than 49b (30 kDa cf. 91 kDa), suggestive of poorer solubility, so aggregation is possible. The electrochemical bandgaps closely matched the optical bandgaps. The LUMO energy levels calculated from cyclic voltammetry measurements for 49a and 49b were −3.92 eV59 and −3.66 eV60 respectively. From the Konarka model this would suggest these polymers have potential efficiencies of 7–9%. The efficiencies obtained from cells using PCBM (2) as acceptor (49 ∶ 2 = 1 ∶ 2) were 2.26% for 49b60 and 1.6% for 49a.59 The devices showed similar short-circuit currents of ca. 5 mA cm−2, but the Voc was higher for 49a (0.85 V vs. 0.76 V). The higher device efficiency for 49b comes from a significantly better fill factor (0.56 vs. 0.37). These devices are unoptimised so it remains to see if efficiency improvements matching those attained for 42 can be achieved for 49, but the excellent charge mobility values give grounds for optimism.
 Fig. 19  Carbazole–diketopyrrolopyrrole copolymers. 
To date the only copolymers with longer bridged oligophenylenes that have been tested in solar cells are copolymers of the indolocarbazoles 38 (Fig. 14).49 Copolymers 50 and 51 (Fig. 20) made from the bisboronate of 38b are fully conjugated along the chain, whereas their counterparts 52–55 made from 38a are conjugated through the nitrogen atoms. The effect of changing the conjugation mode on the electronic properties of the copolymers seems to vary depending on the comonomer. The bandgaps (2.34 vs. 2.31 eV) and orbital energy values (HOMO/LUMO = −5.09/−2.75 vs. −5.12/−2.81 eV) of the quinoxaline copolymers 50 and 52 are virtually identical, but 52 displays a much better hole mobility than 50 (1.89 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1vs. 1.66 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Perhaps as a result the difference in the device parameters of solar cells with PCBM (2) (80 wt%) is the current, which is higher for 52 than 50 (3.15 vs. 1.53 mA cm−2) resulting in a higher efficiency for 52 (0.87%) than 50 (0.32%). The device efficiency for 52 has been further improved to 1.40% by using PC71BM (3) as acceptor. Use of the C70 derivative enhances the current to 4.46 mA cm−2 and the fill factor to 0.48.
 Fig. 20  Indolocarbazole-based copolymers for solar cells. 
For the thienopyrazine copolymers 51 and 53, the picture is more complex. The orbital energies of the conjugated copolymer 51 (−5.11/−3.32 eV) are ca. 0.3 eV lower than for 53 (−4.88/−2.99 eV), which shows up as a lower Voc for the cell using the latter (0.49 vs. 0.60 V), and the optical bandgap is smaller (1.79 vs. 1.89 eV), indicative of better conjugation along the chain. The hole mobility of 51 is slightly lower than for 53 (2.42 × 10−4vs. 4.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), but surprisingly it displays a much better Isc (2.45 vs. 0.98 mA cm−2) and device efficiency (0.66% vs. 0.22%). Of the other two copolymers tested, 54 and 55, the former has poor device performance (0.14% efficiency), while the latter displays a more promising efficiency of 0.49%. All of these polymers have orbital energies higher than the range required for potential high efficiency, but their mobility values are generally acceptable. Lowering the orbitals by incorporating thienyl units might produce significant improvements in their device performance.
Conclusions
We have shown that a wide range of carbazole-based polymers can be made by efficient chemical synthetic routes, whose electronic properties can be tuned to produce materials with good performance in organic photovoltaic devices. Already 6% power conversion has been demonstrated and there are good grounds for believing that materials can be designed and made with efficiencies close to the 10% generally accepted as being required for commercial applications. Carbazole-based materials can be produced with some of the properties such as high charge carrier mobilities, and suitable bandgaps and orbital energies, necessary for obtaining high performance in solar cells. The challenge remains to design and produce a material that possesses all these properties simultaneously, but given the progress made to date one has considerable grounds for optimism that it will be attained in the not-too-distant future.
One possible problem that still remains with 2,7-carbazole-based copolymers is the potential for electrochemical instability due to the build-up of charge at the free para-(3- and 6-) positions, which would lower device lifetimes. In this regard it may be significant that the polymers 51–54 with the conjugation through the nitrogen display such good results, as in these polymers the analogous positions para to the nitrogen bridges are occupied. This suggests that copolymers using some of the bridged oligomers mentioned above (e.g.27) would be well worth investigating. What seems certain is that there is considerable scope for carbazole materials to be used as donor materials for efficient solar cells, and that much exciting research into the development of these materials is waiting to be performed. Carbazole-based materials have surprised us with their performance in solar cells and no doubt many more surprises await us. The story of carbazole-based materials for high performance photovoltaics has only just begun and no one can yet say how it will continue, but it is one that promises to be well worth following.
