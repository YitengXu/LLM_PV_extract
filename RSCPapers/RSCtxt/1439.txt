1. Introduction
Considering the fast depletion of fossil fuels and the negative impact of fossil fuel combustions on the environment, researchers have made great efforts to pursue alternative energy resources such as hydrogen gas. Different strategies have been realized in the past century with the target of efficient hydrogen production.1–3 Among these techniques, electrocatalytic water splitting is a pollution-free and sustainable strategy in producing clean hydrogen fuels.4–6 Typically in an electrolytic cell, the electricity generated from a renewable energy source such as sunlight is able to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode simultaneously.7
Compared to the HER, the OER occurring at the anode is the bottleneck reaction in the overall water splitting process due to its sluggish reaction kinetics and high activation energy barriers of the four-electron transfer process.8–10 Therefore, highly efficient OER electrocatalysts need to be developed urgently to accelerate the reaction rate and reduce energy barriers. Currently, Ir/Ru-based compounds are the benchmark catalysts for the OER. However, high cost and scarcity of these metals restrict their large-scale applications.11,12 Thus, more efforts should be devoted to exploring earth-abundant and inexpensive catalysts.
A large number of economical and earth-abundant transition-metal based materials have been explored as potential electrocatalysts for the OER in the past few decades. Among these catalysts, transition metal oxides and (oxy)hydroxides (TMOs) receive widespread attention due to their significant catalytic performance towards the OER.13–18 In addition, the low cost, environmental friendliness and facile preparation have also made TMOs easy accessible in the OER. They possess high electrical conductivity and structural stability when operating in alkaline solutions,19 which makes them good candidates for the OER.
Owing to the unique chemical and physical properties brought by the dimensional confinement effect, two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have attracted much attention and become a research hotspot in recent years.20,21 The electronic structures of 2D nanomaterials are very sensitive to external stimuli, including structural deformation, external electric fields, chemical modification, doping, and adsorption of other materials, offering the possibility to intentionally tune their electronic properties for desired applications such as heterogeneous catalysis.22–24 In addition, the relatively open array structure and large specific surface area guarantee great accessibility of reaction species to the surface and endow 2D nanomaterials with great potential for use as highly efficient electrocatalysts. Plenty of fabrication strategies have been developed to obtain 2D nanomaterials, such as solution-phase growth,25 and vapor deposition.26 Currently, various 2D nanomaterials have been synthesized and estimated in many different fields, such as graphene, metal carbides, metal nitrides, metal dichalcogenides, layered oxides and hydroxides, layered metal-organic frameworks, and their derivatives.27–30
Self-supported electrocatalysts which are anchored directly on conductive substrates or form free-standing films have been gaining much attention recently. Compared with drop-cast electrodes, self-supported electrodes have made great improvements in terms of mechanical stability, mass transfer of reactants, electron transport, and surface area.31–34 In addition, the binder-free characteristics of self-supported electrodes can both simplify the electrode preparation process and avoid binder additives covering active sites.35–38 Thus, self-supported electrocatalysts exhibit great potential in the field of electrocatalytic water splitting.
In view of these advantages, herein, we aim to provide a review of the recent progress in self-supported 2D TMOs (2D-SS-TMOs) as efficient OER catalysts. We will cover the impressive advances in the synthesis methods and effective strategies in boosting the catalytic activity of 2D-SS-TMOs towards the OER. Their practical applications in photoelectrochemistry and lithium air batteries are also included. An outlook is also provided in the end of this review to provide some insights into the future development of efficient 2D-SS-TMO OER catalysts.
2. Preparation of 2D-SS-TMOs
Top-down and bottom-up are the two major strategies to prepare 2D-SS-TMOs.39 In the former case, exfoliation of bulk TMOs in the liquid phase is the common method because the chemical and physical structure of the as-exfoliated nanosheets are easily controlled.39 However, previous strategies of exfoliating LDHs suffer from high cost, being time consuming, high toxicity, and the strong adsorption between the solvent molecules and the as-exfoliated LDH nanosheets.40 In contrast, the monolayer or ultrathin TMO nanosheets can be acquired directly through the bottom-up strategy, which is a low cost strategy and easy to be scaled up. Nevertheless, this strategy still poses difficulties in the control over the composition and morphology of 2D structures.
2.1 Top-down methods: exfoliation
Exfoliation has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to obtain monolayer or few-layer 2D nanosheets from their bulk counterparts. It has been found that the layer composition, the ionic species intercalated between the layers, and the type of interlayer forces of TMOs have significant a impact on the liquid exfoliation efficiency.41 Unlike the smectite clays that have relatively weak layer interactions, it is a great challenge to exfoliate LDHs because of the strong interlayer electrostatic interactions.42 A variety of methods have been explored to address this challenge. For example, combining initial structural swelling by organic solvents with exfoliation, the interlayer interactions of TMOs can be attenuated.41 LDHs can firstly be converted to a swollen phase and then delaminated to monolayer LDHs with assistance of mechanical ultrasonication or shaking.41 Mg2+–Al3+ LDHs (Mg/Al: ∼2.6–2.9) were able to be disintegrated into monolayers by Hibino's group through amino acid intercalation and exfoliation in formamide.43 These LDHs show pie-like structures with a high ratio of lateral size to thickness of up to around 150. It is noteworthy that the thickness of the 2D layer is between that of the basal spacing (0.8 nm) and a single hydroxide sheet (0.48 nm), indicating that the Mg2+–Al3+ LDHs were successfully exfoliated into monolayers. Co2+–Al3+ LDHs were successfully exfoliated by Sasaki's group for the first time in 2006.44 High-quality nanosheets were obtained via introducing CO32− by ultrasonic treatment with a salt-acid mixed solution in the Co2+–Al3+ LDH hexagonal platelets. The exfoliation process was intensive and has largely altered the morphology of the LDHs, resulting in shattered nanosheets. The CO32− LDHs could be replaced by other forms (e.g., NO3−, ClO4−, acetate, lactate, dodecyl sulfate and oleate) when undergoing a subsequent anion-exchange process after ultrasonic treatment in a salt-acid mixed solution. For instance, NO3− LDHs can be successfully exfoliated in formamide and the nanosheet size was up to 2 mm laterally and 0.8 nm in thickness.44
The 2D nanosheets mentioned above are all Al3+-based materials, and the amphoteric properties of trivalent Al3+ ions are beneficial to the formation of homogeneous precipitates and high crystallinity. In contrast, other trivalent transition-metal cations without amphoteric features can only obtain poorly crystalline products. For example, direct co-precipitation of divalent cations (Mg2+, and Co2+) with trivalent Fe3+ caused poorly crystalline aggregates.45 This issue motivated researchers to develop new strategies for the synthesis of high crystallinity non Al3+-based 2D nanosheets materials. In 2007, T. Sasaki et al. synthesized high crystallinity ultrathin Co2+–Fe3+ LDHs by an innovative topotactic approach (Fig. 1a), which can control the hydrolysis of trivalent transition metal ions (i.e. Fe3+ in this case).45 Specifically, I2-assisted oxidative intercalation was used in this critical step to transform Co2+–Fe2+ hydroxides (brucite-like) into Co2+–Fe3+ LDHs (hydrotalcite-like).

Cobalt-based oxides exhibit great application prospects as water splitting catalysts according to the “volcano” plot.46 The “volcano” plot is essentially a scatter plot that reflects the Sabatier principle in which maximum catalytic activity (i.e. the y-axis) can be achieved at a “neutral” binding state (i.e. the x-axis) between reaction intermediates and catalysts. Too strong or too weak binding strength between the two can lead to inferior activity and this relationship is depicted in a volcano shape.47 For instance, it has been found through theoretical study that the correlation of the overpotential and binding energy of (ΔGO*–ΔGHO*) exhibits a volcano plot for the OER. A desired OER activity can only be obtained at a “just right” binding energy.19 There are also many endeavors made to obtain 2D nanosheet Co-based oxides. For example, Liu et al. reported thin γ-CoOOH nanosheets with half-metallic properties as efficient water splitting electrocatalysts.24 On account of the basically same space structure but different interlayer spacing between α-Co(OH)2 and γ-CoOOH, the “atomic-scale phase transformation process” was designed to prepare γ-CoOOH nanosheets for the first time (Fig. 2a). The α-Co(OH)2 nanosheets obtained through a wet chemistry method were sonicated and exfoliated into ultrathin nanosheets in the presence of water and Cl−.48 Ultrathin γ-CoOOH nanosheets were fabricated by oxidation and exfoliation of α-Co(OH)2 nanosheets with the help of the NaClO oxidant. The nanosheet structure is well confirmed by TEM observations in Fig. 2b, and the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image showed the size of the nanosheets (Fig. 2c). XRD in Fig. 2d revealed that the γ-CoOOH nanosheet has a highly preferred orientation of (00n). Owing to the ultrathin 2D structures, γ-CoOOH nanosheets exhibit a small onset potential of 1.47 V vs. RHE for the OER, whereas a larger onset potential of 1.53 V vs. RHE is required for bulk γ-CoOOH.

2.2 Bottom-up methods
Bottom-up methods are a reverse strategy to realize 2D LDH nanostructures compared to exfoliation. Specifically, highly oriented growth in a confined 2D space can be realized in this general method but it requires sophisticated control over the physical and chemical growth conditions.39 For example, a reverse micro-emulsion technique developed by O'Hare's group in 2005 was found to be effective in preparing Mg-Al LDH.49 Sun and coworkers fabricated MgAl LDH pseudohexagonal single-layer nanosheets through a co-precipitation route with 23 vol% formamide, which was used as an inhibitor.50 During the fabrication of LDH, formamide molecules were adsorbed on the surface of LDH, thus allowing the sheets to grow laterally while inhibiting interlayer growth. Hydrothermal synthesis is another important direct preparation method. Wang's group in 2011 (ref. 51) developed a new strategy to synthesize MgAl LDH ultrathin nanosheets on a large-scale under hydrothermal conditions. Taking advantage of the instability of high concentration H2O2, the vigorous O2 generation during decomposition of H2O2 under hydrothermal conditions can avoid the aggregation of LDH layers (Fig. 1b), and the shattered ultrathin nanosheets (Fig. 1b and c) can thus be obtained.
In addition to these chemical approaches, other direct synthesis methods have also been reported to obtain LDH nanosheets. For example, pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) was demonstrated to be effective in the preparation of LDHs.52 In PLAL, nanoparticles are generated by rapid cooling of a plasma, which is composed of ions originating from the adjacent liquid as well as the ablation target. Through the adjustment of the ablation parameters, PLAL can make the composition and size more controllable. Zn1.48/Al, Co0.96/Fe, Co1.07/Al, and Mg1.97/Fe-LDH colloidal nanosheets prepared by a laser ablation strategy were proposed by Hur's group.53 A rolling-and-folding morphology in the conjunction area was observed in the Mg1.97/Fe and Co0.96/Fe-LDH nanosheets (Fig. 3), while the Co1.07/Al and Zn1.48/Al-LDH nanosheets exhibited an intensively rolled morphology at the edges. The reason for the successful preparation of LDH nanosheets was assumed to be the high laser power and short reaction time, limiting the incorporation of carbonates into the LDH layers.

2.3 Other methods
Through an electrodeposition method, a composite system was established by Markovic's group in 2011. Ultrathin Ni(OH)2 clusters can be electrochemically deposited on a Pt (111) surface.54 The deposition process was conducted either by chronoamperometry (held at potentials above 0.6 V) or by cyclic voltammetry in the range of Hupd and the OH regions. Typical surface coverages of 30–40% were obtained within 10 minutes of electrochemical treatment. These as-deposited Ni(OH)2 clusters show hemisphere-like morphologies (∼0.7 nm in height and ∼8–10 nm in diameter) based on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization, which is equivalent to two layers of Ni(OH)2. In addition, other ultrathin transition metal hydroxide nanoclusters, such as FeOOH and Co(OH)2 modified Pt electrodes were fabricated successfully by their group by a similar method.13 The above results strongly prove that the synthesis of ultrathin 2D nanosheets on certain substrates can be realized by electrodeposition strategies.
By utilizing the liquid metal Ga-induced sputtering–painting–alloying–dealloying strategy, our group also developed CoGa LDH on stainless steel mesh (SSM), representing a novel method in terms of LDH preparation.55 Specifically, a thin layer of a Co film was anchored on the SSM surface successfully via the sputtering process, which was confirmed by the XRD patterns. The CoGa3 alloy/SSM composite was realized through the liquid–solid reaction of liquid Ga and the Co film during the thermal annealing. Subsequently, Ga in CoGa3 was partially etched in the dealloying process, leading to the generation of CoGa LDH (∼27.5 nm) on the SSM.
3. Strategies to improve the OER catalytic activity of 2D-SS-TMOs
In order to promote the OER activities, strategies such as increasing the number of active sites, tuning the electronic properties, and modifying the surface properties of electrocatalysts have been demonstrated. These strategies can increase the O2 amount generated in the reaction or change the adsorption strength of OH intermediates and the electronic conductivity, so as to improve the catalytic activity substantially. This part mainly summarizes the recent advances in improving the catalytic activity of 2D-SS-TMOs.
3.1 Creating vacancies
Defects such as vacancies and step edges are the most reactive sites on the surfaces of TMOs. Understanding the nature of surface vacancies is crucial to the follow-up mechanism study and catalyst design.56 The essential reasons for the catalytic activity enhancement are to tune surface properties and the electronic structure caused by vacancy formation.57,58 For instance, oxygen vacancies (VOs) can usually increase the electronic conductivity of TMOs and facilitate the adsorption of OH intermediates, which is important in the OER process.59–61 Low coordination metal sites (LCMs) can be generated in the presence of VOs, which have been regard as the active sites of TMO catalysts during the OER.62,63
Wang et al. developed an Ar plasma etching strategy and exfoliated bulk CoFe LDHs into ultrathin LDH nanosheets.64 The dry exfoliation in the Ar plasma has decreased the thickness of CoFe LDHs to 0.6 nm, indicating the existence of monolayers. The chemical bonds in the lateral direction were destroyed upon plasma etching. Thus, the surface atoms can escape easily and produce multiple vacancies (oxygen vacancies, and metal vacancies). X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy characterization confirmed the presence of cobalt (VCo) and iron vacancies (VFe), which were relatively rare in the reports of defects. The larger Debye–Waller factor indicates an increased disorder degree, suggesting structural distortion and dangling bonds adjacent to Co sites.64,65 Through the introduction of oxygen and metal vacancies, the coordination number near the catalytic sites reduced to some extent. Meanwhile, the electronic structure of the electrocatalyst was regulated. Thus, the intrinsic activity of the active sites was improved significantly. An overpotential of 266 mV is required to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for CoFe LDHs-Ar whereas the bulk CoFe LDHs need 321 mV to achieve the same current density. In addition, Feng and Li's group obtained vacancy-rich and ultrathin nanosheets via the exfoliation of bulk CoAl-LDHs.66 The measured thickness of the nanosheets was about 3 nm (Fig. 4a–c), in which a lot of vacancies (VO and VCo) existed in the host layers. Through electrostatic attractions, the interaction between Benzyl alcohol and VOs contributed to the generation of defect-free Co–OH and VCo–Co–OHδ−. CoGa LDH nanosheets anchored on SSM synthesized through the sputtering–painting–alloying–dealloying strategy were found to possess abundant oxygen vacancies that led to the under coordinated Co sites (CoO6−x).55 The adsorption of OH on these under coordinated Co sites and the electrophilicity of the adsorbed O can be enhanced greatly.67,68 Thanks to these features, CoGa LDH/SSM is able to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 258 mV which is lower than the 290 mV of RuO2/SSM at the same current density.

3.2 Heteroatom doping
Doping is another important method to improve catalytic activity, through which the charge density can be tuned, and the catalytic performance can be enhanced subsequently. Boettcher and co-workers showed that the incorporation of Fe into the lattice of NiOOH enhanced the electronic conductivity of the electrode and the partial-charge transfer activation was affected by Fe to some extent.69 Owing to the optimal adsorption energy of OER intermediates on Fe3+, Fe3+ species are regarded as important active sites.70,71 The incorporation of other metal cations (Mn, Ti, Ce, Fe, and La) into NiOxHy was studied for a deeper understanding of the Fe role.71 They found that the OER activity of sponge-like NiOxHy could only be improved significantly with the incorporation of Ce and Fe (Fig. 5). The TOFs of the Ni0.85Ce0.15OxHy and Ni0.9Fe0.1OxHy platelets are significantly higher than that of NiOxHy. However, phase segregation of cerium oxide in the Ni(Ce)OxHy film occurred during electrochemical measurements, accompanied by the decay of OER activity. No obvious relationship was observed between the Ni2+/3+ redox couple and the OER activity, illustrating that the contribution of Ni to OER activity was negligible. These findings confirmed the uniqueness of Fe in improving OER catalytic activity.71

Liu and Sun's group introduced Mn2+ with low electronegativity into a NiFe-LDH matrix to modify the surface electronic structure and thus, enhance OER activity.72 Electron enriching Ni2+ and Fe3+ were believed to be a result of electron transfer from Mn2+ to Ni2+ and Fe3+ in the hydroxide matrix. The increased electron density of Ni2+ and Fe3+ in the basal plane is able to accelerate deprotonating steps, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. Mn2+-doped NiFe-LDH showed an onset potential as low as 1.41 V (vs. RHE). Also, in order to reach current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2, Mn2+-doped NiFe-LDH needed overpotentials of 190 mV and 230 mV, respectively, superior to the 335 mV of NiFe-LDH at 100 mA cm−2 and ∼370 mV of RuO2 at 100 mA cm−2. Noble-metal-based oxides such as IrO2 and RuO2 demonstrate great OER performances under alkaline conditions. For example, the overpotentials of IrO2 and RuO2 at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH vary in general between 280 mV and 340 mV.73–76 In comparison, due to the unique 2D lamellar structure and large electrochemical surface areas, 2D-SS-TMOs are able to exhibit comparable or even lower overpotentials at the same current density. For instance, an overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm−2 was achieved by the CoFe LDH in 1 M KOH,76 while S-incorporated NiFe (oxy)hydroxides developed by Cho's group can deliver the same current density at an impressively low overpotential of 190 mV.75
3.3 Constructing composites
Through the combination of catalysts with conductive substrates, on the one hand, the charge transfer ability was improved significantly, and on the other hand, a strong interaction between the active phase and the substrate could be induced, leading to more exposed catalytic sites.77,78 Ma et al. fabricated a NiFe-LDH/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite. The rGO nanosheets and the single-layer LDH nanosheets can be assembled by electrostatic interactions.79 Yang et al. proposed the anion exchange process and obtained strongly coupled NiFe-LDH/rGO hybrids.80 Two nanosheets with opposite charges (cationic FeNi layers and the anionic GO nanosheets functionalized with oxygenic groups) are easier to assemble to form the composites. The as-prepared FeNi–GO hybrids exhibited superior electrocatalytic properties for the OER, with a low onset overpotential of 210 mV. In addition, a much lower onset overpotential of 195 mV can be observed after transforming the FeNi–GO LDH into FeNi–rGO LDH.
In addition to the compounding with carbon materials, the active phase could also be hybridized with other conductive materials to enhance catalytic activity, such as 2D transition metal carbides/carbonitrides (Ti3C2, Ti2C, Nb2C, V2C, Ti3CN, Mo2C, etc.), named MXene.81,82 Wang et al. reported a new type of hierarchical FeNi-LDH/Ti3C2-MXene nanohybrid, which was synthesized via ionic hetero-assembly of FeNi-LDH nanoplates with an interconnected porous network on Ti3C2 MXene (Fig. 6a).83 TEM characterization confirms the presence of loosely packed networks of FeNi-LDH nanoplates on MXene. Owing to the presence of MXene, the charge conductivity of the LDH nanostructure for the OER improved a lot, and the nanosheet structure was firmly immobilized to avoid peeling off. Charge transfer between LDH and MXene was further guaranteed by the strong interaction. On the one hand, more anionic intermediates into the FeNi-LDH lattice through the electrostatic attraction were promoted to a certain extent, and on the other hand, the Ni2+/Ni3+,4+ redox process was accelerated for better OER performance. The FeNi-LDH/Ti3C2-MXene catalyst exhibits overpotentials of 298 mV and 347 mV at 10 and 30 mA cm−2, respectively, much lower than those of the benchmark LDH/MXene catalysts.

Compositing of two active phases can also be carried out to achieve better catalytic performances. Recently, Yu et al. constructed hierarchical FeOOH/NiFe LDHs on Co-based nanowire (NW) arrays to catalyze the OER (Fig. 6b).84 The hierarchical construction was conducive to the scattering of FeOOH/NiFe LDH nanosheets, increasing the surface area to a great extent; thus, the OER activity can be enhanced. This sample needs overpotentials of 220 and 290 mV to deliver current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively.
3.4 Structural distortion
The interatomic distances and surface distortion induced structural changes can increase the number of active sites in order to achieve a high performance.85 Hu's research group reported a representative work about LDH exfoliation.16 In their study, NiFe, NiCo and CoCo LDHs were selected as typical LDH materials. The NiFe LDH was fabricated by a hydrothermal process, while the CoCo and NiCo LDHs were obtained through the topochemical approach.16 The OER performance has been greatly enhanced by the exfoliation of LDHs into single-layer nanosheets with the same chemical compositions. The overpotentials reduced by 40–54 mV after exfoliation at 10 mA cm−2, and are 2.6, 3.4 and 4.5 times higher in current densities at η = 300 mV for CoCo, NiCo and NiFe LDHs, respectively. The exfoliation made it possible to measure the putative active surface and the edge-sharing MO6 octahedral layers directly. The paper proposed that the possible structural changes in interatomic distances and surface distortion after exfoliation might be estimated by synchrotron-radiation X-ray adsorption fine structure spectroscopy.23,86
The exfoliation strategy could also be applied to other hydroxides except for LDH materials. Liu et al. designed the route of the “atomic-scale phase transformation process” to prepare γ-CoOOH nanosheets for the first time.24 The half-metallic characteristic of the γ-CoOOH nanosheets was confirmed by experiments and theoretical calculations. Local structural distortion existed in the surface CoO6−x octahedron of the γ-CoOOH nanosheets. The electrophilicity of H2O and the interfacial charge transfer between OOH species and Co ions can be improved largely, which is indispensable to the enhanced OER activity of layered CoOOH. Zhang et al. also prepared a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst of CoAl LDH nanosheets (CoAl-NSs) on a 3D graphene network (3DGN) by self-assembly through the electrostatic interactions.87
4. The other applications of 2D-SS-TMO OER catalysts
4.1 Photoelectrochemical water splitting
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, directly driven by solar energy, is an ideal strategy for the generation of hydrogen fuels. Semiconductor-based photoanodes for oxygen generation exhibit relatively good performance, but the slow interfacial kinetics and poor charge transport properties restrict the photocatalytic performance, such as energy conversion efficiency and stability. Combining an excellent OER catalyst and a photon-absorbing substrate could decrease the extra power required to drive water splitting.88 Wei et al. designed ZnO core@LDH shell hierarchical nanoarrays, and LDH nanosheets were deposited directly on the ZnO NWs through a facile electro-synthesis method.88 The holes generated in ZnO can oxidize CoII species in the CoNi-LDH shell to CoIII/CoIV species, and the latter are believed to be important co-catalysts to boost the water splitting reaction. Fast transfer of the photogenerated holes from the core to shell requires proper contact at the ZnO/LDH interface, which can promote the photodevice stability and reduce anodic decomposition/corrosion. The ZnO@LDH exhibited a high photocurrent density compared to ZnO NWs, such as a 3 and 7 times current increase at 0.5 and 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively, suggesting improved PEC performance in water splitting with the help of the CoNi-LDH shell. Other metal oxides@LDH core–shell hierarchical nanoarrays, such as TiO2@LDH and Co3O4@LDH, were also prepared for comparison. The ZnO@CoNi-LDH core–shell nanoarray exhibited a largely enhanced photocurrent density and stability compared to ZnO-based photoelectrodes. Through the facile electrodeposition method, Jin's group synthesized amorphous CoFe-H nanosheets and further effectively integrated them into a nanostructured BiVO4 semiconductor for PEC water splitting.89 The photoelectrode showed a lower onset potential of 230 mV (vs. RHE) and a higher photocurrent density of 2.48 mA cm−2 (at 1.23 V vs. RHE) for the PEC-OER, which was the best PEC-OER performance among the BiVO4/catalyst photoanodes. The improved OER kinetics, appropriate electrocatalyst/semiconductor interface, and excellent optical transparency were necessary for obtaining such high PEC performance.
Amorphous catalysts, such as mixed metal oxides/hydroxides, showed better stability and activity. The amorphous Co–La mixed double hydroxide (MDH) on BiVO4/FTO (FTO, fluorine-doped tin oxide) fabricated by the pulse plating strategy was first proposed by Rao's group.90 The MDHs can be deposited and anchored onto BiVO4/FTO uniformly, and the composition and grain size can also be controlled well. Benefiting from this method, the electrode presented faster charge transport and lower charge recombination at the interface. The PEC water decomposition showed that the onset potential reduced to 0.53 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), and the current density increased by 33.4 times at 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The amorphous nature and adjusted interface of BiVO4/catalyst were in favor of obtaining better photostability and PEC activity. On ther one hand, the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of BiVO4 was improved significantly due to the deposition of Co–La(OH)x-based MDH,and on the other hand, the photocorrosion was hindered to some extent, establishing it as a promising candidate for PEC water splitting.
4.2 Li-O2 batteries
Rechargeable lithium oxygen batteries (LOBs) have been considered as the most promising system to solve the current energy crisis.91–93 Compared with the energy densities of conventional Li-ion batteries (200–250 Wh kg−1), they have much higher energy densities (5200 Wh kg−1 when the oxygen mass is included). The oxygen electrode is one critical component of LOBs as it involves many multi-step electron/proton transfer reactions. During the discharging process, O2 can be reduced (oxygen reduction reactions, ORRs) and it reacts with Li+ to form Li2O2 in the porous cathode. The products formed during discharging can release Li+ and generate O2 (OERs) in charging.94,95 The sluggish kinetics of ORRs and OERs resulted in higher polarization, causing large charge and discharge overpotentials of LOBs. A series of catalysts have been studied to expedite ORRs and OERs, among which transition metal oxides have attracted wide attention, owing to their nature abundance, low cost, and good catalytic activity. A hierarchical macroporous/mesoporous NiCo2O4 (NCO) nanosheet catalyst for Li-O2 batteries was synthesized by Sun's group.96 Both mesopores and macropores were present in the as-prepared NCO nanosheets. The mesopores in the NCO nanosheets can provide more active sites for the reaction, accelerating the electrolyte impregnation and oxygen diffusion. As for the macropores formed between the interconnected NCO nanosheets, they are able to supply more helpful space to increase the specific capacity. The Li-O2 batteries with the NiCo2O4 catalyst presented a higher specific capacity (4500 mA h g−1) than the Li-O2 batteries with pristine carbon black.96 Fellinger et al. reported a facile strategy for the fabrication of a new structure at a large scale, which consisted of metal hydroxide and vertically aligned carbon nanosheet (M(OH)x@CNS) hybrid arrays.97 The bifunctional catalyst exhibited both favorable ORR and OER activities for LOBs. As a result, the Li-O2 batteries implemented with these catalysts showed high specific capacity (12123 and 5403 mA h g−1 normalized to the mass of M(OH)x and carbon, respectively). The porous M(OH)x@CNS hybrid nanostructures possessed a high surface area, high conductivity, connected interstitial cavities, and strongly bound CNS and M(OH)x nanoparticles. This was the first report of hybrid carbon and metal hydroxides used for LOBs, which opens up an alternative avenue to use ORR and OER dual functional components as a single catalyst with a favorable pore structure for use as a new cathode for Li-O2 batteries.
4.3 Zn-air batteries
Zn-air batteries are one of the promising metal-air battery systems that can deliver a high theoretical energy density of 1086 Wh kg−1.98 The high abundance of Zn in the crust of the earth is helpful in realizing affordable energy storage to meet the growing demand of electrical energy.99 Nevertheless, decay of the air electrode in the charging process was an urgent problem to be solved. Efficient OER catalysts are urgently in need to accelerate the sluggish kinetics and thus reduce the overpotentials. Tremendous efforts have been made in developing these active and robust catalysts. For example, CoMn double hydroxide (DH) hollow spheres developed by the Li group were found to show high activity in both water splitting and Zn-air batteries.100 At 10 mA cm−2, a low overpotential of 233 mV is needed for the Co2Mn1 DH hollow spheres. Owing to the high performance of their Co2Mn1 DH hollow spheres, the specific capacity of primary Zn-air batteries can deliver a high energy density of 684 mA h g−1, which is larger than that of Pt/C based Zn-air batteries (603 mA h g−1) at 10 mA cm−2. Cho et al. synthesized NiFe sulfide derived S-incorporated NiFe (oxy)hydroxides by a controllable and facile chemical oxidation.75 Owing to the presence of S species that decrease the difference in adsorption energy of O* and OH* intermediates on Fe, the electrode exhibits high OER activity in 1.0 M KOH, with an overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm−2. More impressively, the Zn-air battery that involves the S-incorporated NiFe (oxy)hydroxides catalyst also shows higher stability than the Zn-air battery implemented with Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts, suggesting the robust feature of this electrode.
5. Summary and outlook
In summary, we reviewed the most recent progress in 2D-SS-TMO OER catalysts and paid particular attention to the existing methods of synthesizing (top-down and bottom-up strategies) and activating (creating vacancies, heteroatom doping, constructing composites, and structural distortion) 2D-SS-TMO OER catalysts. Thanks to their remarkable activity, 2D-SS-TMOs have also been demonstrated to be one major component in high performance photoelectrochemical water splitting and Li-O2 batteries where the representative examples were also summarized in this review.
Although great progress has been made, it should be noted that compared with other 2D materials such as graphene the research on 2D-SS-TMOs is far behind, and many challenges need to be urgently addressed in order to push their limits as OER catalysts. Firstly, at present, the metallic elements used to construct 2D-SS-TMO are mainly limited to Al, Fe, Co, Ni, and Mg, while a wide variety of other useful metal ions (such as Mn3+, Rh3+, Ru3+, etc.) are not reported in constructing 2D-SS-TMOs for OER purpose.101,102 The major difficulty lies in the large difference of their ionic radii with those of Mg2+ (0.72 Å) and Al3+ (0.54 Å) in octahedral coordination in 2D-SS-TMOs.103 Secondly, improvement in the current synthesis strategy is still required to obtain high quality 2D-SS-TMOs. For instance, the coordination effect between some solvents (such as formamide) and the exposed metal ions of 2D-SS-TMOs can lead to the damage of the nanosheet structures during exfoliation.41 It is necessary to expand the choices of both highly efficient and compatible exfoliation solvents for the synthesis of 2D-SS-TMOs. Significant difficulties in the control over the co-precipitation kinetics are still present in the preparation of target 2D-SS-TMOs through bottom-up methods.39 More controllable synthesis strategies other than those mentioned above should also be developed to prepare the desired 2D-SS-TMO OER catalysts. Vacancy and doping are the main strategies to modify the electronic structure and improve the catalytic activity at the atomic level. Nonetheless, the conclusions of their roles in the OER are commonly made based on the structural characterization of fresh catalysts. The stability of vacancies and dopants during long-term and harsh OER measurements is still questionable. How they evolve in real-time OER measurements is important to the understanding of the chemical nature of real active centers. Following up this point, the developments of in situ characterization techniques, such as in situ synchrotron X-ray, Raman, IR spectroscopy, etc., have provided the opportunity to reveal and study the real active sites of 2D-SS-TMOs.104–106 The insights obtained from the in situ analysis can also be beneficial to the model construction in theoretical study, which in return can help the design of highly efficient OER catalysts. Last but not least, given that the significant progress of 2D-SS-TMO OER catalysts has been achieved, the catalyst evaluations are still made at the laboratory level (such as room temperature, 1 atm and low concentration alkaline media). In fact, industrial alkaline electrolyzers are usually operated at elevated temperatures (70–100 °C), high pressure (>10 bar) and concentrated electrolyte solutions (concentrated KOH) for the purpose of a maximum higher heating value (HHV), while under these conditions the reported 2D-SS-TMO catalysts that show high activity in laboratory study could exhibit different performances or stabilities. The gap between laboratory study and industrial evaluation methods should be bridged for the purpose of practical application.
