    , Accepted 21st May 2012First published on 21st May 2012AbstractDye-sensitized solar cells are a promising solar technology because of their low cost, reliability, and high efficiency, compared with silicon-based solar cells. Efforts over the last two decades have increased solar cell efficiency to 12% based on liquid electrolytes, and more research on solid-state devices is necessary to determine their practical usage and long-term stability. The development of solid-state devices has achieved an overall efficiency over 7% using hole transporting materials. This study reviews current progress on hole transporting materials, sensitizers, and mesoporous TiO2 in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells using small organic molecules as the hole transporting material. This study also discusses the key factors, such as molecular structure design and interfacial problems, affecting device performance.

1. Introduction
Solar energy is a clean, abundant, and renewable energy source, and is regarded as one of the best ways to solve the energy crisis and environmental pollution problem. Solar cells that convert solar energy directly into electricity have been in development for nearly six decades. The first practical solar cell, with 6% conversion efficiency, was announced by Bell Laboratories in 1954.1 To date, silicon-based technologies have dominated the solar cell market. However, the popularity and growth of the market is restrained by the high production cost, large energy consumption, and pollution involved in fabricating silicon-based solar cells. Therefore, researchers have developed new thin-film type solar cells to remedy these drawbacks. In 1991, Grätzel proposed dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using a Ru-complex dye and nanocrystalline TiO2 mesoporous film with 7% efficiency.2 Since then, DSSCs have become one of the most promising types of solar cells because of their low cost and easier fabrication. The best conversion efficiency to date is 12.3% for small-area device (0.36 cm2)3 and 9.2% for a large-area module (17.19 cm2).4 Worldwide companies producing DSSCs include Solarnix in Switzerland, Dyesol in Australia, and Sony and Sharp in Japan. DSSCs have progressed to the transition stage of commercialization.
DSSCs consist of dye sensitizers, a nanocrystalline semiconductor film, a redox electrolyte or hole transporting layer, and a counter electrode. Fig. 1 shows the device structure and its operation principle. Under light illumination, (1) the dye molecule adsorbed on the semiconductor film is excited from the ground state to the excited state, and (2) the electron pumped to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the dye is injected into the conduction band (CB) of the n-type semiconductor. (3) The electron is transported through the semiconductor layer and then the outer circuit to the counter electrode of the DSSC. The electron at the CB of the semiconductor may undergo recombination with (4) the oxidized dyes and (5) the redox mediator or hole transporting material (HTM). (6) The oxidized dye is then regenerated by the redox mediator or the HTM. Finally, the oxidized mediator or HTM is regenerated (7) at the counter electrode to complete an electric generation cycle in the DSSC. To improve DSSC performance, various methods have been attempted to optimize all parts of the cell and their synergistic interaction.5–10

Although most high-efficiency DSSCs are based on a liquid electrolyte system, the leakage problem of the solvent, and the instability and the corrosive nature of the mediator are obstacles to the commercialization of DSSCs. Thus, researchers in this area have developed various types of quasi-solid/solid-state electrolytes11–15 during the past two decades and advanced these electrolytes to the roll-to-roll manufacturing stage. These electrolytes can be classified into HTM-based hole conductors and solidified/gelled electrolytes depending on their working principles. The latter generally includes electrolytes prepared from liquids or ionic liquids with additives (e.g., polymers,16–22 organic gelators,23–28 inorganic materials,29–32 or their hybrids),33–37 plastic crystals,38–40 and ionic conductors.41–45
The I−/I3− redox couple conventionally used in a DSSC acts as a charge carrier for charge transport between two electrodes, and the charge transport is mainly attributed to the exchange reaction of I− + I3− → I3− + I− instead of the diffusion or migration of the redox couple itself.46 Similar to the hole transporting layers of optoelectronic devices, the HTMs in ssDSSCs involve hole hopping among molecules. Several essential conditions must be met: (1) a compatible energy level layout with the dye-TiO2 functioning as a typical p–n junction for dye regeneration through hole transfer (Fig. 2); (2) efficient deposition within the mesoporous TiO2 film, good pore filling ability, and stable interfacial contact with the dye-TiO2; (3) sufficient hole mobility; (4) thermal and photochemical stability; and (5) no strong absorption in the visible spectrum to avoid competition with dye molecules.
 Fig. 2  Schematic energy level layout illustrating the relative band positions of TiO2, dye, and HTM. 
Inorganic p-type semiconductors were the first HTMs used for ssDSSCs. Tennakone et al. demonstrated the first ssDSSCs in 1995 using p-type CuI semiconductors with 0.8% conversion efficiency.47 To date, three main types of Cu semiconductors have been shown to be suitable for ssDSSCs: CuI, CuBr, and CuSCN. The highest conversion efficiency is 7.4% reported by Sakamoto et al. using CuI as the HTM.48 Other inorganic semiconductors are rarely reported, with the exception of NiO first reported by Bandara et al. in 2005.49 A detailed development of inorganic HTMs appears in ref. 11. A limited choice of materials has led to slow progress in ssDSSCs based on inorganic p-type semiconductors.
Conjugated polymers have also received attention in the past decades because of their low cost, good stability, simple fabrication using the spin-coating process and adaptability. Liu et al. in 2011 comprehensively reviewed the conjugated polymers applied in ssDSSCs, including polyaniline, polypyrrole, poly(3-alkylthiophene), triarylamine-based polymer, poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEHPPV), and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT).15 PEDOT and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) are the most studied of these polymers. A conversion efficiency of 6.8% was achieved using PEDOT as the HTM.50 However, polymers often suffer from insufficient penetration into the mesoporous electrode. In comparison, this is less of a problem for small organic molecules.51
Therefore, this study focuses on recent development in solid-state DSSCs (ssDSSCs) based on small organic molecules as the HTM. This study first presents a systematic review of HTMs made of small organic molecules. Second, this study reviews progress on the photovoltaic performance of ssDSSCs based on different sensitizers. The last part of this study presents a discussion of the interfacial issue within ssDSSCs.
2. Small organic molecules based HTMs
In 1998, Bach and Grätzel et al. reported the first efficient ssDSSC with amorphous organic HTM 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD; Fig. 3).52 Using N(PhBr)3SbCl6 and Li[(CF3SO2)2N] as the additives, the DSSC based on a Ru-complex dye exhibited a JSC of 0.32 mA cm−2 and a VOC of 342 mV, and its overall efficiency was 0.74%. Thereafter, the efficiency of spiro-OMeTAD-based ssDSSCs increased dramatically through dye development and TiO2 modification (as discussed in Sections 3 and 4). Other studies have described improvement through the addition of additives into spiro-OMeTAD, such as 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP)53,54 to increase the VOC and cobalt complexes as p-dopant55 to enhance hole conductivity. Nazeeruddin and Grätzel et al. in 2011 demonstrated a record high efficiency of 7.2% for spiro-OMeTAD ssDSSC using a high molar extinction coefficient organic dye.55
 Fig. 3  The structure of the spiro-OMeTAD. 
Researchers have also investigated novel HTMs other than spiro-OMeTAD, and most of them are arylamine compounds. Table 1 lists the properties and photovoltaic performance of arylamine-based HTMs. Durrant et al. synthesized different types of triarylamine based oligomers in 2006 (HTM1-6).56 They investigated the interfacial charge transfer of solid-state devices using transient absorption spectroscopy and J–V characterization techniques. Their results show that the mobility values were nearly the same using time of flight (TOF) techniques, and show no correlation between hole mobility and cell performance. Most important, the photocurrent was found to be directly proportional to the hole-transfer yield. The hole-transfer yield depends on the extent of pore penetration in the dye-sensitized film and on the thermodynamic driving force for interfacial charge transfer. This implies that the pore filling and interfacial properties are more important than hole mobility in HTM design.

As a result, researchers have attempted to improve the pore filling ability using structural design. In 2006, Snaith and Grätzel et al. developed the tris[4-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-phenyl]-amine (TMEPA) HTM. This material exhibits a low glass transition temperature (−14 °C) and low melting temperature (−7 °C).57 Being liquid at room temperature, TMEPA can easily infiltrate the thin film of the TiO2/dye layer. Using NaBF4 and LiTFSI as dopants improved efficiency up to 2.4% in a cell using Ru dye as the sensitizer under simulated AM1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2). Zhai and Wei et al. designed a chiral molecule (R)-2,2′-dimethoxyl-3,3′-di(phenyl-4-yl-diphenyl-amine)-[1,1′]-binaphthyl ((R)-TPA-BN-TPA) HTM in 2007. Adding N(PhBr)3SbCl6, Li[(CF3SO2)2N], t-BP and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetra-fluoroborate (MB-BF4) to the solid electrolyte obtained an overall efficiency of 0.55% using N719 dye with a JSC of 1.07 mA cm−2 and a VOC of 0.887 V.58
Researchers have developed many small organic molecule HTMs in 2012. O'Regan et al. designed a meltable HTM, called VM3, that can easily infiltrate the TiO2 film in a ssDSSC.59 The best device efficiency of 0.075% (N719 dye) achieved after chemical doping of the HTM with iodine was attributed to the improved conductivity of HTM and reduced charge recombination rate. Cheng et al. reported adamantine-cored arylamine (ad-OMeTPA), a congener of spiro-cored HTM (spiro-OMeTAD).60 Although no photovoltaic data are available, the good thermal and electrochemical stability and remarkable optical and electronic properties of this HTM indicate its potential in ssDSSCs. Sellinger et al. designed new HTMs (AS 37 and AS 44) with low glass transition temperatures, low melting points, and high solubility characteristics to improve pore filling.61 Using Z907 as the sensitizing dye, the cell based on these HTMs achieved the best efficiency of 2.94% using a 2-μm-thick TiO2 film, rivalling the efficiency of the conventional spiro-OMeTAD-based cell. This photovoltaic performance even surpasses that of the spiro-OMeTAD cell as the TiO2 thickness increased to 6 μm, which highlights its promising application in high-efficiency ssDSSCs.
Haridas et al. designed a starburst ethoxy naphthylamine (D) compound HTM.62 An efficiency of 0.39% was achieved in a ssDSSC using D as the HTM and red sandal, a natural dye, as the sensitizer. Despite its relatively low efficiency, the total cost of this cell is approximately 30% to 40% that of a similar type of cell. Boschloo et al. demonstrated an interesting concept of using HTMs capable of light harvesting.63 Tris(thienyl-vinyl-thienyl)-triphenylamine (TVT) was used as a hole transporting dye (HTD) in a squaraine (SQ)-sensitized ssDSSC in which both dyes contribute to the photocurrent. The energy transfer efficiency from TVT to SQ is approximately 26% under steady-state photoluminescence. The low cell efficiency of this approach (0.19%) can be attributed to the slow regeneration of SQ by TVT and the narrow absorption of SQ among other possible reasons.
3. Sensitizers for spiro-OMeTAD-based ssDSSCs
To date, spiro-OMeTAD has been the most popular HTM in ssDSSCs because of its respectable charge carrier mobility. This section presents a discussion of recent progress in ssDSSCs based on spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. As mentioned, a thin TiO2 film is required for better pore filling in ssDSSCs. Therefore, sensitizers with higher molar extinction coefficients are advantageous for ssDSSCs application. Accordingly, researchers have designed various sensitizers for solid-state HTMs to improve the performance of ssDSSCs.
3.1 Ru-complex dyes
The first ssDSSC with spiro-OMeTAD using the Ru-complex dye Ru(II)(4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine)2(NCS)2 (N3 dye) exhibited an efficiency of 0.74%.51 This efficiency was later improved to 3.2% by doping the spiro-OMeTAD.53,64 Inefficient suppression of charge recombination between spiro-OMeTAD and TiO2 appears to hamper the high performance of ssDSSCs based on the N3 dye. In 2007, Thelakkat and Haque et al. studied three different Ru-based supramolecular donor–acceptor dyes with different-sized pendent groups (Fig. 4a) to determine their structural effects on the ssDSSC.65 Transient kinetic study confirmed that these supramolecular Ru dyes significantly retarded the charge recombination with the oxidized dye or oxidized spiro-OMeTAD. The slower charge recombination rate of dyes 2 and 3 compared to dye 1 can be attributed to the increased spatial separation of the dye cation, and therefore, the spiro-OMeTAD cation from the TiO2 surface. In addition, extended π-conjugated bonding and multistep charge-transfer cascades of dyes 2 and 3 should also play important roles. Dye 3 (JSC = 5.0 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.95 V; FF = 0.54; η = 2.6%) exhibited comparable photovoltaic performance to the N3 dye.
 Fig. 4  Heteroleptic Ru-complex dyes with differently sized pendent group. 
Snaith et al.66 synthesized a series of ion-coordinating Ru-complexes with ethylene-oxide/alkane pendent groups (Fig. 4b) for ssDSSCs. They found that the dye with larger pendent groups, K68, suppressed charge recombination more effectively, possibly because the increased positive charge of the lithium cation induced a favourable dipole offset and Coulombic screening effect. The ssDSSC based on K68 dye and sipro-OMeTAD achieved a record power conversion efficiency of 5.1% using the reflective Ag cathode (JSC = 11.0 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.86 V; FF = 0.68).
In 2009, Wu and Grätzel et al. attempted to enhance the light-harvesting ability of Ru-complex dyes using electron-rich hexylthio-bithiophene antennas tethered at the 4 and 4′ positions of the bipyridyl ligand (CYC-B11, Fig. 5).67 The DSSC based on CYC-B11 achieved an efficiency of 11.5% under AM 1.5G-simulated sunlight using a liquid electrolyte. The ssDSSC using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM also achieved excellent performance (JSC = 9.22 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.825 V; FF = 0.63; η = 4.7%). Thereafter, C101, C104, and C10668–70 possessing high molar extinction coefficients were also used in the ssDSSCs. The C101 ssDSSC exhibited a 4.5% efficiency (JSC = 8.193 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.8 V; FF = 0.69), which is attributable to its high molar-extinction coefficient and effective suppression of charge recombination by alkyl chains. The C104 ssDSSC (JSC = 8.386 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.814 V; FF = 0.69; η = 4.6%) with its thienothiophene unit showed good stability under AM 1.5 full sunlight at 60 °C for 1000 h, which is the first report on the stability of ssDSSCs. The C106 ssDSSC, with its (hexylthio)-thiophene unit, exhibited an even higher conversion efficiency (JSC = 8.27 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.848 V; FF = 0.71; η = 5.0%). Bäuerle et al. also reported two series of new Ru-complex dyes with 1,2,3-triazolyl-pyridine ancillary ligands and thiophene-based anchoring ligand in 2011.71,72 The best efficiency of the ssDSSCs based on the sensitizers and spiro-OMeTAD was 3.6% efficiency (JSC = 7.5 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.8 V; FF = 0.60).72

3.2 Metal-free dyes
Compared to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) bands of Ru complexes, the charge transfer band of metal-free dyes normally has a higher molar extinction coefficient. Therefore, a thinner TiO2 film can be used. In 2005, an indoline dye (D102, Fig. 6) was used with spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM, and the ssDSSC fabricated showed an impressive efficiency of 4.1% (JSC = 7.7 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.866 V; FF = 0.612).73 Snaith et al. also incorporated an indoline-based organic dye, D149 (Fig. 6), into ssDSSc using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM in 2009.74 The power conversion efficiency of this design exceeded 6% under AM 1.5 sunlight at 1 mW cm−2 and 10 mW cm−2. However, only 4.2% power conversion efficiency (JSC = 6.6 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.885 V; FF = 0.72) was obtained under full sun conditions (100 mW cm−2). This is the result of a higher electron density within the dye phase because of slower electron transfer from the excited dye to TiO2, compared to hole transfer from the excited dye to spiro-OMeTAD.
 Fig. 6  Indoline-based metal-free dyes. 
Arylamine is widely employed as the electron donor in metal-free dyes, and recent reports have presented arylamine-based dyes in ssDSSCs55,75–81 that achieve excellent conversion efficiencies. In 2009, Sun and Nazeeruddin et al. designed three sensitizers (Fig. 7a) with triphenylamine moiety and a thiophene π-conjugated spacer, and the resulting ssDSSC had an efficiency exceeding 3%.75 The conversion efficiencies of D21L6 (JSC = 9.64 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.798 V; FF = 0.57; η = 4.44%) and D25L6 (JSC = 9.01 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.803 V; FF = 0.56; η = 4.04%) are higher than that of D5L6 (JSC = 7.41 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.788 V; FF = 0.57; η = 3.35%) because the alkoxy units can red-shift the spectra and enhance light harvesting. D21L6 performs better than D25L6 because of its slower electron recombination. Park et al. also reported a series of dyes with a similar structure (Fig. 7b) in 2012.76 They concluded that the end-functional group affects the chemical compatibility with spiro-OMeTAD, resulting in different hole-transfer ability and improved JSC and FF values in the sequence of D-F (JSC = 7.58 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.723 V; FF = 0.482; η = 2.68%) < D-CH3 (JSC = 8.45 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.710 V; FF = 0.504; η = 3.07%) < D-OCH3 (JSC = 9.26 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.717 V; FF = 0.535; η = 3.56%). Boschloo and Hagfeldt et al. compared one anchoring group (D35) with two anchoring groups (M14) (Fig. 7c).77M14 exhibited a bathochromic and hyperchromic spectral shifts, whereas D35 is more effective at blocking the electrolyte from the bulkier arylamine. Accordingly, the ssDSSCs based on D35 (JSC = 7.21 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.855 V; FF = 0.73; η = 4.50%) performed better than that based on M14 (JSC = 8.08 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.815 V; FF = 0.67; η = 4.37%). Other researchers have attempted to increase the molar extinction coefficient using 4,4′-dihexylcyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b]dithiophene as a π-conjugated spacer because of its better planarity. Chi and Chou et al. introduced electronegative fluorine atoms into the dye molecule (Fig. 7d).78 When residing in proximity to the cyanoacrylic anchor, this fluoro-substituent with high electronegativity and small polarizability may avert spiro-OMeTAD toward TiO2 and suppress the charge recombination. For example, the ssDSSC performance of A2-F dye (JSC = 7.52 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.91 V; FF = 0.71; η = 4.86%) was superior to that of A2-H dye (JSC = 6.79 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.83 V; FF = 0.65; η = 3.69%). In 2011, Grätzel et al. reported spiro-OMeTAD-based ssDSSCs of record efficiency using C220 and Y123 dyes (Fig. 7e).55,79C220-based ssDSSCs can achieve an efficiency of up to 6.08% (JSC = 9.74 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.881 V; FF = 0.71) because of their high solar light harvesting capacity, charge generation efficiency, and collection efficiency. Y123-based ssDSSCs have achieved a record efficiency of 7.2%, using tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine)cobalt(III) doped spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM.
 Fig. 7  Triphenylamine-based metal-free dyes with thiophene as the π-conjugated spacer. 
Instead of a thiophene π-bridged spacer, Park and Frank et al. developed a new organic donor–π-acceptor (TA-St-CA, Fig. 8a) arylamine dye using a phenylenevinylene spacer.80 This type of ssDSSC, which consists of a TA-St-CA dye and spiro-OMeTAD HTM, exhibited a high VOC of over 1 V (JSC = 4.25 mA cm−2; VOC = 1.02 V; FF = 0.689; η = 3.0%). Theoretical modeling shows that the steric shielding of the electrons in the TiO2 by the dye reduces recombination with oxidized spiro-OMeTAD, which is important for the high VOC value. Akkaya investigated novel Bodipy (boron-dipyrrin)-based dyes (Fig. 8b) with broad absorption in the visible light region (400–800 nm).81 Although the efficiency of this design is still low (0.28%–0.68% for the three dyes), Bodipy dyes hold significant promise because of their easy structural modification and long wavelength absorption, which extends into the near-IR region. The performance of ssDSSCs based on these photosensitizers may be improved through further rational molecule design.

Fig. 9 shows the perylene dyes recently developed for ssDSSCs. Pschirer and Boschloo et al. reported a broadly absorbing perylene dye (ID176, Fig. 9a) covering wavelengths from 400 to 700 nm.82 They achieved better performance in ssDSSCs using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM (JSC = 8.7 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.64 V; FF = 0.57; η = 3.2%) than those using liquid I−/I3− electrolytes (JSC = 4.2 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.44 V; FF = 0.66; η = 1.2%). This outcome suggests that the oxidized ID176 regenerated faster by spiro-OMeTAD than I−. Alternatively, a reduction of excited dye molecules may precede electron injection into TiO2.83 It is also intriguing that dyes not successfully applied in electrolyte DSSCs could still be candidates for ssDSSCs. Erten-Ela et al.84 also reported two perylene dyes (Fig. 9b) for ssDSSCs. However, the efficiencies of PMI_1 and PMI_2 only reached 0.046% and 0.032%, respectively.

3.3 Quantum dots
Mesoporous TiO2 films sensitized with quantum dots (QDs) such as PbS,85–87 CdS,87–90 CdSe,90,91 or Sb2S392 have attracted recent attention in ssDSSCs in conjunction with spiro-OMeTAD HTM. The intense absorbance of QDs is advantageous in ssDSSCs because a thinner mesoporous film can be used for better HTM penetration. However, inefficient adsorption is a major problem for QDs. Plass et al. reported PbS adsorbed on TiO2 by chemical bath deposition for ssDSSCs in 2002, and the resulting efficiency under 0.1 sun (10 mW cm−2) was low (0.49%).85 Researchers subsequently investigated successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR)87,88,91 and atomic layer deposition (ALD),89 and the former method was found to be more effective, and therefore, more commonly used for QDDSSCs. Efficiencies exceeding 1% under 1 sun were archived using PbS87 (JSC = 4.58 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.56 V; FF = 0.57; η = 1.46%) or CdSe(Te)91 (JSC = 4.39 mA cm−2; VOC = 0. 64 V; FF = 0.55; η = 1.57%). Co-sensitization by CdS/CdSe improved light harvesting with enhanced JSC and VOC and efficiency under 1 sun (JSC = 1.79 mA cm−2; VOC = 0. 61 V; FF = 0.55; η = 0.61%), compared to ssDSSCs using single QD (JSC = 0.56 mA cm−2; VOC = 0. 46 V; FF = 0.52; η = 0.13%).90 Hodes and Grätzel et al. applied Sb2S3 and spiro-OMeTAD for ssDSSCs in 2010, and the performance exceeded that based on other QDs. They achieved a high efficiency of 3.1% at 1 sun (JSC = 10.62 mA cm−2; VOC = 0. 61 V; FF = 0.48).92
4. Interfacial improvement
In addition to the molecule design of the HTM and sensitizers, interfacial contact and kinetics are also important factors governing device performance. The penetration of HTM into the mesoporous TiO2 electrode should allow facile regeneration of excited dye molecules, instead of simply wetting the surface.93 However, contact between the TiO2 and HTM normally results in unfavorable recombination.94–96 Thus, further interfacial improvement of ssDSSCs is necessary to optimize the cell performance.
In a thorough study of each component of ssDSSCs, Thelakkat et al. indicated that the pore diameter of mesoporous TiO2 was more a significant factor in the device performance than its surface area.97 The optimal pore size should be in the range of 30–50 nm. McGehee et al. used simulations to predict that the efficiency of ssDSSCs would improve 25% after achieving a 100% pore filling fraction (PFF).98 The PFF represents the percentage of TiO2 pore volume occupied by the HTM, and is an index for judging the extent of the HTM penetration. The PFF can be expressed by the following equation:99 (1)where X is the weight fraction of the HTM infiltrated in the TiO2 pores, compared to the total weight of TiO2 and HTM infiltrated. ϕ is the porosity of TiO2. dTiO2 and dHTM are the densities of TiO2 and HTM, respectively. Snaith et al.100 varied the TiO2 thickness and found that the PFF decreased with thicker film (i.e., a thinner film facilitates pore filling). They also reformed the spin-coating process of spiro-OMeTAD by increasing the solution concentration, achieving a higher PFF. Researchers have proposed alternative methods of HTM casting to manage pore filling, including doctoral-blading101 and vacuum deposition.102 Another straightforward approach to increase pore filling is to modify the TiO2 structure. In 2009, Zakeeruddin and Grätzel et al.103 reported the first application of a TiO2 nanotube array to ssDSSCs to facilitate the penetration of spiro-OMeTAD, and achieved a 1.67% efficiency (C203 dye). A similar concept applied to a quasi-solid-state DSSC was proposed in 2005 using a TiO2 nanorod to improve interfacial contact.104 Steiner and Snaith et al.105 proposed an ordered gyroid TiO2 network (Fig. 10) in 2009. The highly ordered pore structure with uniform infiltration of spiro-OMeTAD brought the concept of bulk heterojunction configuration into ssDSSCs. They achieved a 1.7% efficiency ssDSSCs using an indoline dye (D149) adsorbed on a 400-nm-thick gyroid TiO2 network. In 2011, Bouclé et al.99 improved the PFF of spiro-OMeTAD from 58% to 77% using TiO2 nanocrystals synthesized by laser pyrolysis and a metal-free dye, D102. The JSC value of the ssDSSCs also increased from 8.66 to 9.27 mA cm−2.

Another important issue in ssDSSCs is the charge recombination from the interfacial contact between the TiO2 and the HTM. The high recombination of electrons from the TiO2 to the HTM results in a 100–200 mV loss of VOC in an ssDSSC, compared to a conventional liquid-type DSSC.94 It is interesting that the VOC value can be increased at stronger light intensity, lower working temperature, or thinner device thickness.106 There were different attempts in surface modification of TiO2 for optimization of the VOC value in ssDSSCs. Co-adsorbents have been investigated in liquid-type DSSCs to reduce recombination by shifting the conduction band of TiO2 upward.107,108 Co-adsorption in ssDSSCs improves the VOC value, the electron lifetime, and the overall efficiency.109,110 Another similar concept is surface passivation by treatment with an insulating thin layer such as ZrO2111 or MgO,112 which retards the recombination with HTM. ZnO was also used as a semiconductor for ssDSSCs, but only low efficiency was obtained (0.5%) with the N719 dye.113 Instead of retarding the recombination, the ZnO semiconductor covered with ZrO2 or MgO enhanced the photo-induced charge generation (i.e., increased JSC).114 The surface treatment of ZrO2 or MgO plays a role in changing the electronic level of ZnO in addition to simply acting as an insulating layer. Tuning the electronic level of the semiconductor for different density of state alters the balance between the charge recombination and photo-induced charge generation.115 The recombination process occurs at the HTM/transparent conductive oxide (TCO) interface, and can also be retarded by introducing a blocking layer under a mesoporous TiO2 film.116
5. Final remark
This paper presents a summary of recent progress in application of small organic molecules as hole transporting materials for dye-sensitized solar cells, including material developments, device performance, and the ssDSSC improvements. Compared to the liquid electrolyte system, interfacial problems at the mesoporous semiconductor/sensitizer/HTM interface are more critical in determining the cell performance. Developments in small organic molecule HTM and molecular design have mainly focused on the pore filling property and hole conductivity. To date, most of these HTMs have been arylamine compounds, with spiro-OMeTAD being the first and the most studied compound. To improve ssDSSCs based on small organic molecule HTMs, it is necessary to design a sensitizer and modify the mesoporous semiconductor. The enhancement of the light-harvesting ability of sensitizers is a key factor in high-efficient efficiency ssDSSCs because thin mesoporous films can address the pore filling problem. Conversely, the charge recombination between the mesoporous semiconductor and the HTM should not be overlooked. To address this problem, researchers have attempted to change the molecular design of the sensitizer or surface coverage on semiconductors to repel HTM from the mesoporous semiconductor. Therefore, optimizing the cell efficiency requires the close integration of every component within the ssDSSC system.
