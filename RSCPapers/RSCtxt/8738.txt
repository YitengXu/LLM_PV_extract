    , Accepted 1st December 2020First published on 8th December 2020AbstractHydrogen generation through solar-driven water splitting is a promising green technology for the sustainable development of human society; however, its wide application is severely restricted by the expensive noble-metal electrocatalysts. Herein, a novel Fe–Ni5P4/Fe–Ni2P (H-FeNiP) heterojunction electrocatalyst is developed by simultaneously taking advantage of the heterojunction effect and the doping effect. It shows excellent activity for both the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in alkaline solution, which only require overpotentials of 231 ± 3 mV and 86 ± 8 mV to deliver 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the heterojunction structure can induce charge transfer from the underlying layer to the surface, which is effective in reducing the activation energy barrier for the HER and OER intermediates. This favorable activity enables the H-FeNiP couple to exhibit an impressive solar-to-hydrogen performance when connected with an organic solar cell (PTB7-Th/PC71BM/COi8DFIC), the power conversion ratio of which (73.10%) is even higher than that of the commercial Pt‖RuO2 couple (69.98%). Overall, this study conceptually provides an alternative avenue for cost-effective hydrogen generation in an environmentally friendly manner for the future.
1. Introduction
The heavy emission of greenhouse gases has led to our ecology being perturbed on an unprecedented scale, so it's imperative to build a carbon-neutral energy system.1 Hydrogen (H2) has been considered to be one of the most potential alternatives for traditional fossil fuels due to its short-period renewability and environmental friendliness.2 By far, steam methane reforming and coal gasification are the main pathways for industrial H2 production, which still release large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2).3 Hence, human society can only benefit from H2 energy when a totally green energy cycle has been well developed. Towards this end, solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion via electrocatalytic water splitting has been proposed as an ideal route to sustainable H2 generation with hardly any environmental impact4–7 and has been enthusiastically pursued recently.8–13
In a typical STH system, the electrocatalyst plays the most important role because it can effectively accelerate both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER), which leads to a favourable hydrogen generation efficiency.14,15 Currently, noble-metal-based materials, such as Pt, Ru and Ir, are the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts, but their large-scale application is severely hindered by their prohibitive cost and elemental scarcity.16–18 Therefore, seeking earth-abundant electrocatalysts has become a hotspot.19–24 Recently, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have attracted comprehensive research interest due to their high activity and considerable stability in water splitting.25–29 So far, although significant effort has been devoted to developing novel TMP electrocatalysts, such as synthesizing new phases, fabricating new composites and engineering the interface,30,31 only the single effect was considered in previous design strategies, which led to the electrocatalytic activity being still inadequate and unsatisfactory. Thus, it's urgent to develop a novel design strategy that can collaboratively modulate the activity by multivariate effects.
Herein, a dual synergy strategy is first proposed by simultaneously taking advantage of the heterojunction effect and doping effect based on the consideration that the former is effective in modulating the band structure and the latter can tune the local electronic structure, which have received considerable attention in recent studies.32–40 Furthermore, since Ni5P4 has proven to be superior in the HER,41 it's highly beneficial to develop Ni5P4-terminated TMP electrocatalysts. Under this guidance, a novel FeNiP electrocatalyst with an Fe–Ni5P4/Fe–Ni2P surface heterojunction has been synthesized via the H2-assisted phosphidation method (denoted as H-FeNiP). The obtained H-FeNiP shows excellent bifunctional activity for both the HER and OER, which makes it more efficient than the commercial noble-metal couple (Pt‖RuO2) in STH conversion when coupled with an organic solar cell (OSC) of PTB7-Th/PC71BM/COi8DFIC. Density functional theory (DFT) investigations reveal that the heterojunctions are conducive to induce favourable charge transfer in the surface region, which can efficiently reduce the activation barriers for intermediates and eventually accelerate the kinetics. This work is a stepping stone to promote the development of sustainable hydrogen generation with environmentally benign and cost-effective STH systems in the future.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The FeNiP electrocatalyst is synthesized by phosphidation of the hydrothermal precursors in an atmosphere of H2/Ar or Ar, which are defined as H-FeNiP and A-FeNiP, respectively (Fig. 1a and S1†). Fig. 1b shows their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, in which the diffraction peaks at 40.7°, 47.3° and 54.2° can be attributed to Ni2P (space group: P2m, PDF no. 74-1358), while those at 2θ = 44.6°, 51.9° and 76.5° are from nickel foam (NF) (PDF no. 04-0850, see Fig. S2†). Furthermore, the weak peaks at 2θ = 28.8°, 30.4°, 31.5°, 34.6° and 36.0° are distinct from Ni2P but match well with Ni5P4 (space group: P63mc, PDF no. 89-2588),42 demonstrating the hybrid nature of FeNiP. Moreover, the patterns show similar characteristics with Fe2P (pace group: P2m, PDF no. 85-1725), but distinct from FeP (space group: Pna21, PDF no. 71-2262), suggesting that the presence of Fe may not exist in the form of the FeP structure (Fig. S2†). However, an obvious mismatch can be seen between the diffraction peak at 40.7° and the strongest line of Fe2P, indicating that Fe2P is not the major phase. Therefore, Fe is probably doped in the Ni–P matrix (Fig. S3†). The morphologies are observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which shows that the entire NF is uniformly coated by vertically aligned nanosheet arrays (Fig. 1c and d). A close observation reveals that the nanosheets assemble into interconnected nanopores with diameters of 200–500 nm, providing plentiful surface sites and convenient avenues for mass transport and gas release, which is further confirmed by the N2 adsorption investigations (Fig. S4†). According to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) techniques, the nanosheets have polycrystal structures with very thin features (Fig. S5†). Furthermore, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) is performed to study the microstructure of the nanosheets. A-FeNiP shows a set of lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.249 nm on the near surface region, which can be indexed to the (104) plane of Ni5P4 (Fig. 1e), while the spacing is 0.221 nm in the deep surface, corresponding to the (111) plane of Ni2P (Fig. S6a†). As revealed by scanning TEM (STEM) and the mapping images, Ni, Fe, and P are distributed homogeneously in the nanosheet without elemental segregation (right panel of Fig. 1e), suggesting that A-FeNiP features a bulk heterojunction structure, i.e. the Fe–Ni2P core is coated with a thick layer of Fe–Ni5P4, while in the HRTEM image of H-FeNiP, two sets of distinct but intersecting lattice fringes can be identified in the surface region (Fig. 1f). The one on the outer surface can be indexed to the (104) plane of Ni5P4 and the other in the subsurface with a spacing of 0.337 nm matches well with the (001) plane of Ni2P. Thus, the ultra-thin Ni5P4 layer and the underlying Ni2P form a novel surface heterojunction with uniformly doped Fe, i.e. Fe–Ni5P4/Fe–Ni2P (more information can be found in Fig. 1f and S6†), which differs distinctly from the bulk one.

Bottom panels illustrate the structural change from the surface to the bulk and the right panels show the STEM images and elemental mapping of Ni, Fe, and P; the scale bars of inset images are 200 nm. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is then used to probe the chemical state of the surface elements (Fig. S7†). Since the high-resolution 2p spectra of Ni and Fe comprise two spin–orbit doublets (Fig. S8†), the 2p3/2 branches are investigated in detail due to their higher intensity ratio (I2p3/2:I2p1/2 = 2:1). As shown in Fig. 2a, the Ni 2p3/2 spectra of A-FeNiP can be deconvoluted into three peaks, which are assigned to Ni–P bonds at 853.6 eV, Ni–O bonds at 857.1 eV and a satellite at 861.1 eV, respectively.43 Similarly, the four peaks in the Fe 2p3/2 spectra of A-FeNiP can be identified as Fe–P (706.7 eV), Fe–O (710.5 and 712.3 eV) and a satellite (715.6 eV) (Fig. 2b).44,45 Furthermore, the peaks at 129.0 eV (P 2p3/2) and 130.4 eV (P 2p1/2) in the P 2p spectra are characteristics of M–P (M = Ni, Fe) bonds, while those at 134.7 eV and 136.9 eV are attributed to P–O bonds.46 Therefore, the XPS peaks can be divided into two groups: the one at lower binding energy is related to M–P, while the other at higher binding energy is related to M–O, which is caused by surface oxidation when exposed in air.47 Since the oxidized P and metal species will restructure into phosphide under HER conditions,48 the M–P related bonds are further investigated. In the H-FeNiP spectra, the Ni–P bond shifts to lower binding energy (853.4 eV) while the Fe–P binding energy becomes higher (707.2 eV) together with the positive shift of P 2p3/2 (129.4 eV) and P 2p1/2 (130.5 eV). This phenomenon indicates that the surface heterojunction structure can lead to charge transfer from Fe to Ni.

2.2. Electrocatalytic activity for water splitting
The electrocatalytic activity is evaluated in 1 M KOH by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. For a better illustration of the doping effect, Fe-free nickel phosphides (A-NiP and H-NiP) are also prepared in this study (Fig. S6†). Because the OER is normally the bottleneck of overall water splitting, the anodic LSV curves are measured first through the backward scanning method, which could avoid the overlap of the catalytic current by the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox reaction (Fig. S10†).45,49 As shown in Fig. 3a, the OER activities of A-NiP and H-NiP are obviously superior to that of the bare NF but still inferior to that of the commercial RuO2. In sharp contrast, Fe-doping can dramatically promote the OER activity, leading to the LSV curves of A-FeNiP and H-FeNiP being more favorable than that of RuO2. Since electrocatalytic activity deeply depends on elemental composition, the influence of the Fe-dopant is systematically investigated, which shows that 3:1 is the optimal Ni:Fe ratio for the OER (Fig. S11†). To deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η10), H-FeNiP only requires 225 mV, which is very close to that of A-FeNiP (226 mV) but significantly lower than that of RuO2 (269 mV), A-NiP (280 mV) and H-NiP (275 mV). According to the statistical study, the presented η10 for H-FeNiP is within 2 standard deviations of 231 ± 3 mV (Fig. S12a† and 3b), confirming the reliability of the results. Afterwards, the Tafel plot (η versus log(j)) is obtained to gain insight into the fundamental OER kinetic mechanism. As displayed in Fig. 3c, H-FeNiP shows a Tafel slope of 35 mV dec−1, which is within 1 standard deviation of 32 ± 4 mV dec−1 (Fig. S12b† and 3d) and significantly smaller than those of RuO2 (59 mV dec−1), A-NiP (94 mV dec−1) and H-NiP (87 mV dec−1), indicating that the excellent OER activity of H-FeNiP may originate from its favourable charge transfer kinetics. As the Tafel slope of A-FeNiP (37 mV dec−1) is nearly the same as that of H-FeNiP, it's firmly believed that they share a similar OER mechanism. More impressively, the low η10 and small Tafel slope make the H-FeNiP stand in the front rank of non-precious OER electrocatalysts obtained to date (Fig. 3e and Table S1†).

(e) Comparison of H-FeNiP with NiFe-based OER catalysts in η10 and Tafel slopes (see Table S1†). (f) HER LSV curves and (g) the corresponding η10. (h) Comparison of H-FeNiP with NiFeP-based HER catalysts in η10 (see Table S2†). Each error bar is based on the data statistics of at least 10 samples. 
Subsequently, the cathodic LSV curves are measured to study the HER performance. When the potential is higher than −0.3 V, NF exhibits “inert” behaviour, guaranteeing the measured HER activity comes from the electrocatalysts (Fig. 3f). As expected, both the surface heterojunction and Fe-doping can effectively promote the HER activity, endowing H-NiP and A-FeNiP with better performance than that of A-NiP. However, only H-FeNiP shows drastically enhanced activity that can compare with that of Pt, indicating that the dual synergistic effect of the Fe–Ni5P4/Fe–Ni2P surface heterojunction plays an important role in the HER. By varying the composition, the sample with a Ni:Fe ratio of 3:1 also shows optimal activity for the HER (Fig. S13†), the η10 of which (87 mV) is significantly lower than those of A-FeNiP (164 mV), A-NiP (200 mV) and H-NiP (182 mV) and comparable with that of Pt (40 mV) (Fig. 3g). The statistical study yields 86 ± 8 mV for η10 (Fig. S14a and b†), which makes it one of the best non-precious HER electrocatalysts by far (Fig. 2h and Table S2†). Besides, H-FeNiP exhibits a Tafel slope of 88 ± 11 mV dec−1 (Fig. S14c and d†), which is only second to that of Pt (Fig. S15†), indicating that the HER proceeds via an accelerated Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism (H2O + e− = H + OH− and H2O + e− + H = H2 + OH−).50
Although the effect of NF has been excluded, the surface of NF can be transformed into Ni5P4 & Ni2P under similar experimental conditions. Thus, the electrocatalytic activity of phosphidation treated NF, denoted as NF-P, is also studied (Fig. S9†). This shows that the active regions of NF-P are far from those of H-FeNiP (Fig. S16†), demonstrating the little impact of background currents. To further exclude the influence of the substrate, H-FeNiP nanoarrays are grown on the inactive carbon felt (CF) (for details see Fig. S17†). According to the statistical study, the electrocatalytic performance of H-FeNiP@CF is very close to that of H-FeNiP@NF (Fig. S18†). When eliminating the influence of the electrochemical surface area, their LSV curves are nearly overlapped with each other (Fig. S19 and S20†), suggesting that H-FeNiP possesses high intrinsic activity for the OER and HER.
Since the surface of FeNiP will evolve into amorphous layered double hydroxide (LDH) under anodic potentials,51 the role of NiFe-LDH in the OER is also studied. It can be seen that NiFe-LDH requires obviously higher overpotentials than H-FeNiP to deliver the same current density (the η10 is 252 mV), indicating that the superb OER activity of FeNiP originates from the NiFe-LDH/FeNiP surface heterojunction (Fig. S21a†). As for the HER, although the superiority of the Fe–Ni5P4/Fe–Ni2P surface heterojunction has been verified due to the drastically reduced overpotentials of H-FeNiP, the influence of surface oxidation is still unclear. To uncover this mystery, the H-FeNiP is heated in air to deliberately introduce the oxidized species. It's clear that the FeNiPOx shows significantly degenerated HER activity (Fig. S21b†), indicating that the oxidized surface has a negative effect on the HER performance of H-FeNiP, which proves that the high activity comes from its M–P species.
As it shows such excellent activity for both the OER and HER, the H-FeNiP must be very promising for overall water splitting. In this study, two pieces of electrodes are assembled as the anode and cathode in a mimetic electrolytic cell. As expected, the H-FeNiP couple shows outstanding performance (Fig. 4a) with a cell voltage of merely 1.52 ± 0.02 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b and S22†), which is much lower than that for the commercial Pt‖RuO2 (1.63 V) and can match up to that for the state-of-the-art bifunctional electrocatalysts (Table S3†). Furthermore, the faradaic efficiencies are measured to be nearly 100% for both the OER and HER (Fig. 4c), indicating that the H-FeNiP couple could minimize the energy loss during water splitting.

(c) Faradaic efficiencies of H2 and O2. (d) Chronopotentiometry curve for the H-FeNiP couple in a two-electrode configuration at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. 
To be a technologically viable electrocatalyst, the operation durability and stability are also of great importance. As shown in Fig. 4d, the H-FeNiP couple can continuously deliver 10 mA cm−2 for 100 hours, and the cell voltages remain nearly constant (±0.02 V). Meanwhile, the LSV curves before and after electrolysis nearly overlap with each other (Fig. S23†), which demonstrates that the H-FeNiP is quite stable in long-term operation. Furthermore, the LSV curves for both the OER and HER remain almost unchanged after 5000 cyclic voltammetry scans (Fig. S24†), also suggesting its remarkable durability. Based on the XPS studies, the surface suffers less destruction after the HER while it is converted to NiFe-LDH after the OER (Fig. S25†), but the structures and the morphologies are well preserved (Fig. S26†). All in all, these results demonstrate that H-FeNiP is very promising for water splitting applications due to the excellent robustness.
2.3. Mechanism investigations of the OER and HER by DFT calculations
To obtain a basic understanding of the dual synergistic effect on the HER and OER, DFT calculations are further performed. Since the synergy of Fe-doping on the HER activity of Ni5P4 and the OER activity of NiOOH have been well investigated in recent studies,52–55 the following efforts in this work are mainly devoted to the effect of the surface heterojunction. As has been pointed out in the hierarchical architecture, the influence of the inner component on the surface electrocatalytic activity decreases rapidly with the increasing thickness of the outer layers;56 therefore the effect of Fe–Ni2P has little impact on the surface properties of Fe–Ni5P4 in the bulk heterostructure. Based on this consideration, Fe–Ni5P4 is used for the HER calculations of A-FeNiP (Fig. S27a†). As for H-FeNiP, a Fe–Ni5P4/Fe–Ni2P heterojunction is carefully constructed (Fig. S27b†). To gain insights into the changes in the electronic structure, density of states (DOS) is first calculated. As shown in Fig. 5a, H-FeNiP possesses higher DOS near the Fermi level than the A-FeNiP, suggesting that the formation of the surface heterojunction can improve the conductivity, which can be proven by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. S28†).57 Bader charge analysis shows that Fe–Ni5P4 will gain charge from Fe–Ni2P, leading to an electron-rich surface which can reduce the HER energy barrier (Fig. S29†).58 In an alkaline medium, the HER undergoes the successive processes of H2O adsorption, H2O dissociation and H desorption; the adsorption configurations and the corresponding free energies are studied in detail (Fig. 5b and S30†). The downward free energies suggest that the adsorption of H2O is a thermodynamically favourable step, and the lower energy on the Ni site than on the Fe site in each system suggests that H2O is preferably adsorbed on the former one (Fig. 5c). Afterwards, the H2O molecule dissociates into HO and H, yielding an energy barrier of 0.50 eV for the Ni site of H-FeNiP, which is remarkably smaller than that of A-FeNiP (1.07 eV). Finally, the adsorbed H will electrochemically convert into H2 with the aid of another H2O molecule, which can be quantitatively described by the hydrogen adsorption free energy, ΔGH* (Fig. 5d).59 This shows that the ΔGH* of both the Fe site (−0.28 eV) and the Ni site (0.32 eV) are far from the thermoneutral value (0 eV), suggesting that the adsorption of H on A-FeNiP is either too strong or too weak. In comparison, the Ni site of H-FeNiP shows a much reduced ΔGH* (0.13 eV), which can be even lower when taking into consideration the spin-orbit coupling effect,60 indicating that it is the active center for the HER in H-FeNiP.

(b) H2O dissociation processes on the Ni site of H-FeNiP; detailed distances are shown in Table S4.† (c) Calculated water dissociation energy and (d) hydrogen adsorption free energy on Ni and Fe sites of A-FeNiP and H-FeNiP; they share the same legends. (e) Calculated DOS of O 2p and Ni and Fe 3d-band for NiFe-LDH and NiFe-LDH/FeNiP. The dashed black lines show the Fermi levels and the dashed coloured lines show the 2p or 3d-band center. (f) Calculated free energy of H2O*, OH*, O* and OOH* intermediates adsorbed on Ni and Fe sites of NiFe-LDH and NiFe-LDH/FeNiP (bottom panel). The top panel shows the optimized structure of intermediates on the Ni site of NiFe-LDH/FeNiP. 
To study the OER mechanism, the models are constructed based on the following considerations. Firstly, as mentioned above, the surface of phosphides will experience reconstruction (see also Fig. S25†), leading to the real active species being a surface heterojunction of NiFe-LDH/FeNiP for A-FeNiP and H-FeNiP, and NiOOH/NiP for A-NiP and H-NiP. Since the activity trend is NiFe-LDH/FeNiP > NiFe-LDH > NiOOH/NiP (Fig. S31†), the first two structures are contrastively studied. Secondly, in the post-OER XRD pattern of H-FeNiP, the Fe–Ni2P phase is well preserved while the Fe–Ni5P4 one becomes faded (Fig. S26a†), and thus a NiFe-LDH/Fe–Ni2P heterojunction is constructed as the reasonable model so that the ultrathin Fe–Ni5P4 layer will be totally corroded during the prolonged OER process (see Fig. S32†). Furthermore, because A-FeNiP possesses nearly the same Tafel slope as H-FeNiP for the OER, it's reasonable that the NiFe-LDH/Fe–Ni2P heterojunction is also suitable to reveal its OER mechanism. Since the OER kinetics is determined by the interaction strength between the p-orbital of oxygen-containing intermediates and the d-orbital of transition metal active centers,61 the corresponding projected DOS of the 3d-band of Ni and Fe and the 2p-band of O is presented in Fig. 5e. It can be seen that the 3d-band center of Fe in NiFe-LDH/Fe–Ni2P shifts significantly to a lower energy level relative to the bare NiFe-LDH, while it's slight for Ni, indicating that charge transfer may occur from Fe–Ni2P to NiFe-LDH. In contrast, the 2p-band of O is slightly up-shifted, indicating that the surface binding strengths of OH*, O* and OOH* will be weakened.62 Additionally, the DOS of NiFe-LDH/Fe–Ni2P is higher than that of NiFe-LDH near the Fermi level, suggesting the decreased resistance (Fig. S33†). To provide further support for this view, the free energies are subsequently calculated and the optimized structural configurations are presented in Fig. 5f and S34.† This shows that the activation of OOH* is the rate-determining step for NiFe-LDH with a ΔG3 of 2.03 eV at the preferable Ni site; however, it's still much higher than the ideal value (1.23 eV). Excitingly, NiFe-LDH/Fe–Ni2P shows a significantly reduced ΔG3 on the Ni site (1.70 eV), which suggests that the excessively strong adsorption has been dramatically alleviated, and the following O2 release step (ΔG4 = 1.78 eV) is the rate-determining step (see Table S5†). In brief, the construction of a surface heterojunction is effective in accelerating the HER and OER processes.
2.4. Solar-to-hydrogen generation performance of H-FeNiP driven by an organic solar cell
Finally, an organic solar cell (OSC) was employed to build the STH conversion system in this work since it holds great potential in satisfying the ultralight-weight and low-cost requirements due to its excellent processability and scalability for preparation.63,64Fig. 6a illustrates the schematic diagram of the novel STH system, in which the H-FeNiP catalysts are coupled with an OSC of PTB7-Th/PC71BM/COi8DFIC. As shown in Fig. 6b, the intersection of the current–voltage (J–V) curve with the polarization curve yields an operating power (POP) of 49.54 mW cm−2 under 1 sun (AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2), which is very close to the maximum power (PMAX, 51.11 mW cm−2) of the OSC, indicating that the STH system suffers from a minimal energy loss in energy conversion.6 More impressively, it can deliver a considerably large current density of 30.4 ± 0.6 mA cm−2 (Fig. S35†), while the STH efficiency is 5.57%. However, as pointed out by Rothschild et al., the STH efficiency depends greatly on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the applied PV cell, which is inappropriate to assess the STH system.10 To make a fair comparison, the power conversion ratio (STH/PCE) is proposed as a reasonable parameter.65 Based on this figure of merit, our STH system shows a STH/PCE of 73.10%, which is higher than that of the commercial Pt‖RuO2 couple under the same operating conditions (69.98%) and can compare favourably with those driven by perovskite or GaAs solar cells (see Table S6†). Additionally, the measured current density around 10 mA cm−2, the criterion for the STH conversion,1 can be well reproduced under chopped sunlight illumination, indicating its considerable stability (Fig. 6c and Movie S1†).

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a novel Fe–Ni5P4/Fe–Ni2P heterojunction electrocatalyst (H-FeNiP) by the dual synergy strategy. XPS studies combined with DFT calculations reveal that the dual synergy can effectively induce charge transfer, which is conducive to reducing the energy barriers for both the HER and OER leading to excellent bifunctional activity towards overall water splitting. The dramatically reduced overpotentials make the H-FeNiP couple show a considerably large current density of 30.4 ± 0.6 mA cm−2 when coupled with a PTB7-Th/PC71BM/COi8DFIC solar cell, the STH performance of which is more favourable than that of the commercial Pt‖RuO2 couple. This work is a proof-of-concept study in exploring low-cost highly efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting, which can serve as a trigger to promote the evolutionary innovation in sustainable hydrogen generation systems.
