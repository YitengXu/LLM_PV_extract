Compared with the “naked” porphyrin ZnP, i.e. having no triarylamine moiety, broadened and red-shifted spectral features were exhibited by the triaylamine porphyrin sensitizers ISB-ZnP, CZ-ZnP, and IDB-ZnP where ISB = 5-phenyliminostilbene, CZ = 5-phenylcarbazole, and IDB = 5-phenyliminodibenzyl. Percentage power conversion efficiencies (η) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (%IPCE) in DSSC devices show the trend ISB-ZnP < ZnP < CZ-ZnP < IDB-ZnP. Inferior performance of the ISB-ZnP dye is attributed to its weaker adsorption to the TiO2 film, which is roughly half that of ZnP. In contrast, introduction of the CZ and IDB electron donors is demonstrated to promote a better performance than the “naked” ZnP porphyrin. The best performance was observed for the IDB-ZnP device reaching a power conversion efficiency of η = 3.62% under AM 1.5 irradiation conditions with a corresponding %IPCE maximizing at 48% for both Soret band (450 nm) and Q band (570 nm) photoexcitation.
Introduction
Due to their low cost and high power conversion efficiencies, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant attention as alternatives to conventional photovoltaic devices based on silicon.1,2 In the early years of DSSC development research was focused mainly on the development of metal complexes as sensitizers inspired by the N3 and N719 dyes.3–5 While ruthenium based sensitizers have offered great redox stability in DSSC devices, there has always been environmental concerns with respect to their large scale application.6 For this reason organic photosensitizers, inspired by the porphyrin, chlorin and bacteriochlorin pigments found in the light harvesting antenna of photosystem II, have earned much interest.7–12 Organic photosensitizers have a greater capacity for light absorption than the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) based visible absorption of ruthenium based photosensitizers and in recent years, due to enhanced steric and electronic molecular engineering, have competed successfully with the most efficient metal based DSSC devices.13 A wide variety of organic dyes such as porphyrins,14–18 coumarins,19–21 perylene,22,23 phthalocyanines,24 triarylamines,25,26 and carbazoles26,27 have been developed as successful alternatives to ruthenium(II) based sensitizers for use in DSSCs, however, the porphyrin chromophore remains the most widely studied system due to the combination of its highly evolved synthetic access and favorable optical, photophysical, electrochemical properties.28,29 Not only does the porphyrin chromophore exhibit multiple strong absorption bands in the visible region, but its redox and photophysical properties can be finely tuned by functionalization at either of its four meso or eight beta positions.30–32 The most celebrated application of porphyrins in a DSSC to date is the work of Yella et al. where the ethynyl conjugated triphenylamine porphyrin YD-o-C8 donor–π–acceptor system has achieved an overall power conversion efficiency of η = 12.3% in full sunlight.13,18 In this particular case the strong tendency of the planar porphyrin macrocycle to π-aggregate at the TiO2 surface was resolved by introducing bulky alkyl substituents to provide considerable steric hindrance while also maximizing photocurrent generation by preventing charge recombination from the reduced TiO2 conduction band and the oxidized [Co(bpy)3]3+ mediator.33 Similarly, Aljarilla,34 Fan,35 and Zegkinoglou36 have synthesized porphyrin dyes bearing the carbazole moiety as a redox active substituent in a donor–π–acceptor structure. Wang has recently introduced the triarylamines IDB (5-phenyl-iminodibenzyl) and ISB (5-phenyl-iminostilbene) as semi-rigid electron donating groups in conjugation with the simple thienyl cyanoacrylic acid acceptor.37 A respectable power conversion efficiency of η = 5.83% was observed for the ISB donor leading to the conclusion that the semi-rigid donor structure contributes to a greater charge injection efficiency and an overall improvement in DSSC performance. In the current study we wanted to test the hypothesis that expansion of the covalent aryl bridging linkage of the carbazole donor would lead to an overall improvement in DSSC performance utilizing a donor–π–acceptor porphyrin design. Three new porphyrin dyes are here presented with the rigid triarylamine electron donors CZ (5-phenyl-carbazole), ISB and IDB introduced at the meso position of porphyrin ring (Fig. 1). The “naked” photosensitizer zinc(II)-15-(4-carboxyphenyl)-10,20-diphenylporphyrin (ZnP) lacking a meso-functionalized triarylamine electron donor was studied as a reference system. Structural, electronic, photophysical and computational properties of these systems were investigated by 1H-NMR and mass spectroscopies, UV-vis electronic absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopies, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), cyclic voltammetry, photocurrent–voltage and electrochemical impedance measurements.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
Three rigid triarylamine porphyrin dyes were synthesized to afford the target photosensitizers CZ-ZnP, IDB-ZnP and ISB-ZnP alongside the reference dye ZnP (Scheme 1). The porphyrin precursors dipyrromethane, 5-phenyldipyrromethane and 5-(4-methoxycarbonylphenyl) dipyrromethane were synthesized according to the literature.38 The rigid triarylamine aldehydes 1, 2 and 3 were synthesized by a Buchwald–Hartwig type C–N coupling reaction between p-iodobenzaldehyde and the appropriate diarylamine in 52%, 62% and 67% yield, respectively, with a Pd(OAc)2/DPEPhos catalyst in THF. This latter method proved more efficient than the previously reported Vilsmeier–Haack strategy.37 The meso-substituted porphyrin intermediates 4, 5 and 6 were subsequently prepared by a standard MacDonald type 2 + 2 condensation reaction. Although the yields of 4, 5 and 6 were low due to scrambling reactions, sufficient quantities of sensitizer were isolated to proceed with the subsequent zinc(II) insertion and ester hydrolysis steps. The ZnP reference dye was synthesized in a similar manner.

UV-vis electronic absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopy
UV-vis electronic absorption spectra of the porphyrin dyes recorded in dichloromethane are presented in Fig. 2a. All of the dyes exhibit typical features of a porphyrin chromophore with a strongly absorbing Soret band (S0 → S2) band in the 410–430 nm spectral region with associated molar extinction coefficients in the range of 2.34 × 105–5.16 × 105 M−1 cm−1. The less intense Q(0,1) and Q(0,0) bands (vibronic bands within the S0 → S1 electronic transition) are observed in the spectral range 530–570 nm with molar extinction coefficients varying from 0.40 × 104–7.68 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (Table 1). As anticipated, due to introduction of the electron rich triarylamine substitutents, noticeable red-shifts of the Soret (7–10 nm) and Q (6–51 nm) bands are observed in each of the CZ-ZnP, IDB-ZnP and ISB-ZnP porphyrins relative to ZnP. The red-shift of the Soret bands is slight most likely due to the orthogonal orientation between the meso-aryl and central porphin ring systems. The same Soret bands do show a significant decrease in their molar extinction coefficients however, relative to the ‘naked’ ZnP system, with a concomitant broadening of their full-width half-maxima (fwhm). This suggests significant vibronic coupling between the triarylamine donors and the porphyrin ring system and is also favorable for enhanced light harvesting over a wider spectral range than ZnP (vide infra).39 Interestingly, ISB-ZnP shows the strongest decrease and broadening of its Soret band for the series (ε = 3.54 × 105 M−1 cm−1; fwhm = 1336 cm−1) likely due to its extended π-conjugation across the back of the ISB donor. Fig. 2b shows the normalized absorption spectra of the porphyrin photosensitizers adsorbed on optically transparent 5 μm thick mesoporous TiO2 films. The Soret and Q bands on TiO2 films are comparable to their solution phase spectra in Fig. 1a with a slight broadening possibly due to monolayer aggregation at the TiO2 interface.40 Encouragingly, from a light harvesting perspective, relatively strong Q band absorption is observed for all dyes adsorbed on the mesoporous TiO2 films.

Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in acetonitrile solvent to best reproduce the solvation conditions in a DSSC device. Typical for a meso-tetraphenyl porphyrin system, two distinct fluorescence bands are observed which arise from the Q(0,0)* and Q(0,1)* vibrationally resolved transitions (Fig. 3). All triarylamine substituted porphyrins show a stronger Q(0,0)* band relative to the ZnP system resulting in a slight increase in their fluorescence quantum yields. This may be as a result of increased molecular rigidity relative to the “naked” ZnP system. The ISB-ZnP system displays the largest quantum yield of the series at Φfl = 0.0020 (Table 1). Such low fluorescence quantum yields are typical of the porphyrin macrocycle which has a strong tendency for non-radiative decay due to vibrational freedom of the macrocycle.

Q-band (S0 → S1) and Soret (aka B) band (S0 → S2) transitions are also included for reference. 
Computational analysis
To help guide interpretation of electrochemical data (vide infra), in correlation with the UV-vis electronic absorption spectra, computational analysis was conducted on each of the porphyrin photosensitizers. Geometry optimization was first carried out by density functional theory (DFT) using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) with the dielectric constant of dichloromethane41 where the rB3LYP hybrid exchange–correlation functional42,43 and 6-31g** basis set44,45 was used for all atoms. A vibrational frequency analysis coupled with the PCM model was carried out in order to confirm the minimum-energy geometry in solution. Electronic transitions contributions and oscillator strengths were subsequently determined by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT).46 Molecular orbital energies with frontier orbital images are presented in Fig. 4 with an exemplar TD-DFT predicted UV-vis spectrum presented in Fig. 5 for the IDB-ZnP dye. A comprehensive summary of all TD-DFT data is provided in the ESI† for each dye. A closer look at the DFT optimized dye geometries is presented in Fig. 6. Interestingly, all triarylamine porphyrins show a slight ruffling of the porphyrin macrocycle relative to ZnP which likely contributes to the slight broadening and red-shift of their Soret bands.47 Furthermore, comparison of the triarylamine donor optimized geometries in Fig. 6 illustrates the non-planarity of the rigid IDB and ISB aryl groups relative to CZ. This effect may inhibit π-delocalization onto the IDB and ISB phenyl groups enhancing their electron donating capacity towards the porphyrin ring. This hypothesis is consistent with the trend in oxidation potentials observed experimentally via cyclic voltammetry studies below.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of all porphyrins were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) to assess their potential for application in a TiO2 based DSSC device. Critical for this application, the excited state oxidation potential of the photosensitizer must be more negative than the TiO2 semiconductor conduction band (ECB = −0.50 V vs. NHE) for an exergonic charge-transfer photocurrent generation. Similarly, the excited state reduction potential of the photosensitizer must be more positive than the 2I− → I2˙− oxidation reaction within the DSSC I3−/I− redox mediator solution to facilitate dye regeneration.48,49 Unfortunately the 2I− → I2˙− oxidation reaction can only be estimated as <+0.93 V vs. NHE.49,50 In fact, the iodide oxidation potential is often misquoted as the triiodide reduction E(I3− → 3I−) = +0.35 V which occurs at the Pt counter electrode and is responsible for the observed VOC based upon the relationship VOC = E(I3− → 3I−) − EFermi(TiO2).48,49 Of course, reversible oxidation and reduction processes are also favoured to impart increase stability and high turnover number of the photosensitizer in a functional device. Cyclic voltammograms of all porphyrins recorded in N,N-dimethylformamide are presented in Fig. S21† and their data summarized in Table 2 in reference to the SCE electrode. All triarylamine porphyrins show a reversible first oxidation potential in contrast to the quasi-reversible nature of the ZnP first oxidation at +0.76 V. Oxidation of both IDB-ZnP and ISB-ZnP occurs at +0.74 V implying that they are slightly more electron rich than CZ-ZnP which displays its first oxidation potential at +0.82 V. A second quasi-reversible oxidation is observed for all triarylamine porphyrins in the range +0.94 to +1.02 V. All porphyrins in the series display three reductions, the first of which occurs in the narrow range of −1.41 V to −1.43 V implying that there is little change in energy of the porphyrin π* based LUMO energy level upon introduction of the various triarylamine electron donating groups. This is consistent with DFT calculations due to the limited π-conjugation across the orthogonal porphyrin and meso-aryl substituents.

The photosensitizer excited-state oxidation, E(S+/S*), and reduction, E(S−/S*), potentials can be estimated by consideration of the absorbed photon energy according to eqn (1) and (2). 
E(S+/S*) = E(S+/S) − ΔE0–0(S/S*)
(1) 
E(S−/S*) = E(S−/S) + ΔE0–0(S/S*)
(2)here, ‘S’ symbolizes the ground state photosensitizer, ‘S+’ and ‘S−’ the oxidized and reduced forms of the photosensitizer, S* the singlet excited state of the photosensitizer, and ΔE0–0 the 0–0 energy of the S0 → S1 electronic transition. ΔE0–0 may be estimated by determining the point of intersection between the normalized Q(0,0) absorption and Q(0,0)* emission bands. Alternatively, the electrochemically determined HOMO–LUMO band-gap Ebg may be used although this is often overestimated relative to optical band gap (Table 3). Energy level alignment of all porphyrins is summarized in Fig. 7. Here sufficient driving forces are observed for excited-state charge-transfer oxidation to the TiO2 conduction band, ΔG = ∣E(S+/S*) − ECB(TiO2)∣, and the subsequent dye regeneration by the iodide redox mediator.34

Photovoltaic studies
Dye-sensitized solar cells were fabricated according to standard methods using an FTO/TiO2 sensitized photoanode, FTO/Pt cathode and a I3−/I− acetonitrile redox mediator electrolyte. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves are presented in Fig. 8. The surface coverage parameters of each dye (Γ, mol cm−2) and detailed parameters of photovoltaic performance, i.e. short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η), are summarized in Table 3. The reference ZnP photosensitizer shows a power conversion efficiency of η = 3.01% while the CZ-ZnP and IDB-ZnP dyes show the best performance with η = 3.47% and 3.62%, respectively. This is primarily due to an increase in photocurrent with CZ-ZnP maximizing at JSC = 7.00 mA cm−2. Although IDB-ZnP displays a slightly lower photocurrent (JSC = 6.93 mA cm−2) its greater fill-factor (FF = 0.780) allows it to top the series of dyes studied. Interestingly, the ISB-ZnP photosensitizer displays a poorer performance than even the ZnP reference system with a power conversion efficiency of just 2.55%. The lower VOC of ISB-ZnP of 640 mV is likely due to a lowering of the TiO2 Fermi-level consistent with the poorer photocurrent observed (JSC = 5.92 mA cm−2). To gain further insight into the photocurrent generation of each device their incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured (Fig. 9). Consistent with the J–V plots, a lower photocurrent is observed across the entire visible spectrum for ISB-ZnP with a similar trend observed across the series, i.e. ISB-ZnP < ZnP < CZ-ZnP < IDB-ZnP. The improved light harvesting performance of CZ-ZnP and IDB-ZnP is consistent with their greater surface coverage relative to ISB-ZnP. In fact, both CZ-ZnP and IDB-ZnP display 48% IPCE maxima upon irradiation of both their Soret and Q-bands.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
To gain further insight into the influence of the rigid triarylamine substituents on DSSC photovoltaic performance electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was conducted to study interfacial charge-transfer resistance.51 EIS analyses was performed in the dark at an applied bias of −0.6 V making the electronic and steric properties of each dye the only variable between each device. Nyquist plots are presented in Fig. 10. An electrochemical impedance Nyquist plot of a DSSC device typically contains three semicircles.51–53 The high-frequency (leftmost) semicircle, associated with the Pt → I3− interfacial charge-transfer processes, is usually of weak intensity (low resistance) and is here obscured by the larger mid-frequency semicircle. The latter is attributed to TiO2 → I3− interfacial charge recombination, here of prime importance. Finally, the low-frequency (right-most) semicircle, attributed to I3−/I− mass-transfer resistance, is also weak and is again mostly obscured by the intense mid-frequency signal.
 Fig. 10  Electrochemical impedance Nyquist plots of porphyrin DSSC devices under a −0.6 V applied bias in dark conditions. 
Dominance of the mid-frequency semicircle in the Nyquist plot confirms that TiO2 → I3− interfacial charge transfer is rate-determining and significantly influencing the overall device efficiency. Under the experimental conditions employed (−0.6 V bias in the dark), observation of a high resistance to TiO2 → I3− interfacial charge-recombination is favourable. This informs on the porosity of the TiO2/porphyrin monolayer and its capacity for preventing performance deteriorating TiO2 → I3− charge-recombination. Consistent with having the lowest VOC, power conversion efficiency and %IPCE of the series ISB-ZnP displays the least resistance to charge-recombination. Overall the Nyquist plots show that the TiO2 → I3− charge-recombination resistance increases in the order ISB-ZnP < ZnP < IDB-ZnP < CZ-ZnP. An identical trend is observed across the series for both JSC and VOC which suggests a similar trend in the TiO2 Fermi level according to the relationship EF = VOC − E(I3−/I−). An increased JSC and VOC is anticipated for CZ-ZnP based upon its greater oxidation potential and hence greater driving force for dye regeneration via iodide oxidation. However, considering these electronic factors, a slightly higher power conversion efficiency is still observed for the IDB-ZnP photosensitizer consistent with its greater surface coverage and larger fill factor relative to CZ-ZnP. Therefore the trend in observed photovoltaic parameters and charge-recombination resistance for the triarylamine porphyrin sensitizers here studied goes beyond their electronic properties and can be attributed to a combination of dye surface coverage and possibly even triarylamine steric effects at the TiO2–photosensitizer interface.
Conclusions
In summary, three new porphyrin sensitizers containing the 5-phenyl-carbazole (CZ), 5-phenyl-iminodibenzyl (IDB) and 5-phenyl-iminostilbene (ISB) electron donors have been designed and synthesized for application in DSSCs. It was found that the CZ-ZnP and IDB-ZnP dyes exhibit an improved photovoltaic performance compared to the “naked” ZnP dye, which lacks a meso-substituted triarylamine electron donor. In contrast, the ISB-ZnP triarylamine photosensitizer displays a lower efficiency than ZnP. Using a combination of J–V, %IPCE and electrochemical impedance analysis the trend in DSSC device performance was found to correlate extremely well with the JSC, VOC and TiO2 → I3− charge-recombination properties. As the electronic properties of each dye studied in solution were not deemed significantly different to cause such an effect, the differences observed in device performance are best attributed to surface coverage and steric factors which together control porosity and I3− mass-transfer in the mesoporous TiO2/porphyrin film. In conclusion, this study confirms the critical importance of both the electronic and structural characteristics of triarylamine electron donors when designing a DSSC photosensitizer and highlights the IDB triarylamine donor as a promising alternative in the future design of original and versatile organic photosensitizers.
Experimental section
Materials and reagent
All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification, unless otherwise noted. THF was dried prior to use by distillation over sodium using benzophenone as an indicator. CH2Cl2 was also freshly distilled prior to use. All chromatographic separations were carried out on silica gel (300–400 mesh or silica H) using CH2Cl2:petroleum ether solvent systems.
Analytical measurements
1H-NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO on Bruker AV400 spectrometer. The chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (δ) relative to the appropriate reference signal: residual chloroform (δH 7.26 ppm) or DMSO (the quintet centered at 2.50 ppm). High resolution MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Autoflex TOF/TOF III instrument. UV-vis electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1800 instrument. Although, acetonitrile is more suitable for mimicking DSSC conditions, molar extinction coefficients were determined in CH2Cl2 as complete dissolution of solids was not possible in acetonitrile. Emission spectra were recorded on a PTI Quantamaster 40 fluorimeter. Fluorescence quantum yields for all samples (Φfl) were calculated by the optically dilute technique in argon degased acetonitrile solutions with ZnTPP used as a reference (Φref = 0.033 in toluene) for all samples according to eqn (3).

The subscript “s” refers to the sample and the subscript “ref” to the reference sample, A is the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, I is the integrated emission area, ηs is the solvent refractive index of the unknown sample and ηref is the solvent refractive index of the reference sample. Excitation and emission slits were both set at 2 nm and an excitation wavelength of 555 nm was used for all samples. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted on a CH Instruments 620D potentiostat for all complexes. A standard three electrode cell was used with a supporting electrolyte of 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in spectrophotometric grade N,N-dimethylformamide under an atmosphere of argon. The electrode assembly consisted of a glassy carbon disc working electrode (3 mm diameter), a Pt wire counter electrode and a non-aqueous reference electrode to minimize IR drop. The latter consisted of a Ag wire in the same 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 N,N-dimethylformamide electrolyte but separated by a porous vycor frit. The ferrocenium/ferrocene redox couple was used as a pseudo reference and was added to each porphyrin electrolyte solution at the end of every experiment for in situ calibration.
Computational analysis
Geometry optimization was first carried out using density functional theory (DFT) with the rB3LYP hybrid exchange–correlation functional42,43 and 6-31g** basis set44,45 for all atoms as implemented in the Gaussian ‘09 program54 using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) with the dielectric constant of dichloromethane.41 A vibrational frequency analysis coupled with the PCM model was carried out in order to confirm the minimum-energy geometry in solution. Subsequent time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were carried out on all compounds.46 Finally, the percent contributions of atomic orbitals to molecular orbitals were calculated using the Gausssum software.55
Absorption spectra on TiO2 films
Absorption spectra of the sensitizers deposited on optically transparent TiO2 films were measured with a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrometer. The TiO2 films with a typical thickness of 5 μm were dipped into 0.3 M ethanol solution of dyes for 15 min, then the sensitized films were rinsed with ethanol three times and air-dried before measurement of their absorption spectra.
Measurement of surface coverage (Γ)
TiO2 films with an area of 0.16 cm2 and 16 mm thickness were dipped into 0.3 M ethanol dye solutions for 2 h and then thoroughly washed with ethanol to remove any excess physisorbed dye. The quantity of chemisorbed dye was estimated by desorption in 3 mL of 0.1 M EtONa solution. The absorption spectra of the EtONa solutions were then measured to obtain the surface coverage (Γ) via molar extinction coefficient data according to the standard method.56
Fabrication of DSSCs and photovoltaic measurements
A TiO2 sol–gel was prepared from P25 following a literature procedure.57 The FTO/TiO2 electrodes were prepared by screen printing on a pre-cleaned FTO glass. The film was then annealed to 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min. Finally, the TiO2 film was post-treated with an aqueous TiCl4 solution (50 mM) at 70 °C for 30 min, rinsed with ethanol, and annealed again at 500 °C for 30 min. After the film was cooled to 100 °C, the TiO2 electrode was immersed into an ethanol solutions of the dye (0.3 mM) for 2 h. The sensitized electrode was rinsed thoroughly with ethanol and then air-dried. A sandwich cell consisting of the porphyrin sensitized TiO2 working electrode and a Pt foil counter electrode was fabricated. The electrolyte (0.06 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile) was injected between both working and counter electrodes. Upon fabrication the porphyrin based DSSCs were tested under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) by photocurrent–voltage (J–V) analysis on a Keithley 2400 Source meter (solar AAA simulator, Oriel China, calibrated with a standard crystalline silicon solar). The percentage power conversion efficiency (η) was calculated according to eqn (4): 
(4)where JSC is the short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), VOC is the open-circuit voltage (V), FF is the fill-factor and I0 the light flux (AM 1.5G). Photocurrent action experiments were performed on a commercial apparatus (Q Test Station 2000 IPCE Measurement System, CROWNTECH, USA) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies were calculated according to eqn (5): 
(5)where ISC(λ) is the monochromatic short circuit current, I0(λ) is the monochromatic light flux incident on the 0.16 cm2 DSSC area and λ is the monochromatic excitation wavelength. Electrochemical impedance spectra of the DSSCs were recorded on a CH Instruments 760D potentionstat at a forward bias of −0.6 V under dark conditions at room temperature. The spectra were scanned in a frequency range of 0.1–106 Hz and an AC amplitude of 10 mV at room temperature.

 	Fig. 3  Corrected fluorescence emission spectra of all porphyrins recorded in argon degassed acetonitrile at 298 K. Peak areas are relative to the calculated quantum yields (re. Table 2). A schematic (right) is included to explain the origin of the higher energy Q(0,0)* and lower energy Q(0,1)* vibrationally resolved emission bands within the S1 → S0 electronic transition. Q-band (S0 → S1) and Soret (aka B) band (S0 → S2) transitions are also included for reference.	 

 	Fig. 4  Molecular orbital energy level diagram for ZnP and the rigid triarylamine porphyrin dyes calculated using DFT (rB3LYP/6-31g**/dichloromethane PCM). HOMO and LUMO levels are highlighted in blue and red, respectively, with theoretical band gaps (eV) included for comparison. Electron occupancy is not displayed, and only select frontier orbital images are included for clarity.	 

 	Fig. 5  Overlay of theoretical (line & curve) and experimental spectra for the IDB-ZnP dye calculated/recorded in dichloromethane PCM/solvent, respectively. Electronic transitions and major contributions responsible for the Soret and Q band absorptions are also highlighted.
