The crystal structure of Gd2(WO4)3:3% Er3+/10% Yb3+ was refined by Rietveld method and it was showed that Er3+/Yb3+ were successfully doped into the host lattice replacing Gd3+. Under 980 nm laser excitation, intense green and weak red emissions centered at around 532 nm, 553 nm, and 669 nm were observed, which were assigned to the Er3+ ion transitions of 4H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2, respectively. The optimum Er3+ doping concentration was determined as 3 mol% when the Yb3+ concentration was fixed at 10 mol%. The pump power study indicated that the energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+ in Er3+, Yb3+ co-doped Gd2(WO4)3 was a two-photon process, and the related UC mechanism of energy transfer was discussed in detail.
Introduction
Near-Infrared-to-visible (NIR) up-conversion is an optical process, when near infrared photons are converted into visible photons by multiphoton absorption, which is governed with the anti-Stokes rule.1,2 The UC luminescence has attracted a lot of interest from researchers because of its wide potential applications, such as bio-labels, solar cells, optical data storage, displays and so on.3–9 For UC phosphors, excellent fluorescence is always achieved by doping rare earth (RE) ions into luminescent hosts. Among various ions, Er3+ is the one of the most studied active ions. Since Er3+ has a long life of intermediates level and abundant 4f level structure, it can continuously emit green or red photons when excited by high energy photons.10 In contrast, Yb3+ ions are doped as a sensitizer, and it can enhance the near-infrared (around 980 nm) absorption and improve the UC luminescent efficiency of Er3+.
The host matrixes play a crucial role in the UC process. The good hosts can support doped ions in a fine crystalline field, in which energy transfer (ET) can easily take place in the host, and, thus, improve significantly the luminescence properties. To be more specific, host materials should be chemically stable and have low phonon energy to avoid efficiency loss via non-radiative transfer.11 Tungstate crystals are among classic inorganic luminescent materials.12 In 1896, the X-ray luminescence of CaWO4 was discovered by Pupin.13 The tungstate crystals provide great mechanical strength and chemical and thermal stability.14,15 Because of the strong covalent W–O bond in WO42− groups, the tungstate can improve the averaged covalency of crystal, and, respectively, the solubility of rare earth ions can be enhanced.16–19 Of those researches of tungstate doped with rare earth phosphors, most are single tungstate crystals similar to scheelite and double tungstate crystals ALn(WO4)2 (A = alkali metal ions, Ln = rare earth ions). While, there is less study on poly-tungstate.
Gadolinium tungstate, Gd2(WO4)3, can be doped easily doped by Er3+/Yb3+ at Gd3+ position because of the similar ionic radius and electrovalence of Gd3+ and Er3+/Yb3+. Besides, the ionic radius of Gd3+ is larger than that of Er3+ and Yb3+, and it can be easily substituted by Er3+ and Yb3+.20,21 Li et al.22 prepared Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped Gd2(WO4)3 via a co-precipitation method, and investigated pumping-route-dependent concentration quenching and temperature effect on the phosphors. Sun et al.23 prepared Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped Gd2(WO4)3 and Gd2WO6 using co-precipitation method, and reported the up-converted emission differences between those two phosphors. However, the crystal structure of Gd2(WO4)3 has not been reported, and how the doped ions affect the lattice parameters and structure of Gd2(WO4)3 host has not been discussed.
In this research, Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped Gd2(WO4)3 phosphors have been synthesized by a conventional high temperature solid-state reaction method. The crystal structure of Gd2(WO4)3:3% Er3+/10% Yb3+ is refined by Rietveld method. And the structural characteristics and UC luminescent characteristics of phosphors are investigated. Also, the rare earth ion doping concentration effect on the UC luminescence and the UC mechanism of energy transfer are discussed.
Experimental
The Gd2(WO4)3:xEr3+/0.1Yb3+ (x = 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05) phosphors and Gd2(WO4)3:0.03Er3+/yYb3+ (y = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.015, 0.2, 0.025) phosphors were synthesized by the high temperature solid-state reaction method. The starting materials of Gd2O3 (99.99%), Er2O3 (99.99%), Yb2O3 (99.99%), and WO3 (A.R.) were mixed based on stoichiometric ratio and ground in an agate mortar. The mixtures were reacted in an aluminum crucible at 1050 °C for 12 hours in resistance furnace in the air. After the furnace cooled down naturally, the samples were ground for further test.
The phase composition of as-prepared phosphors was examined by X-ray diffraction measurement (XRD, D8 Advance diffractometer, Bruker, Germany, with Cu-Kα and linear VANTEC detector, λ = 0.15406 nm, 40 kV, 30 mA). The powder diffraction data of Gd2(WO4)3:3% Er3+/10% Yb3+ for Rietveld analysis was collected at room temperature by the step size of 0.02° (2θ), and the counting time was 3 s per step. The Rietveld refinement was performed using package TOPAS 4.2.24 The Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) was recorded over the range of 4000–400 cm−1 by an Excalibur 3100 (USA) device. The diffuse reflection spectra were measured by UV-NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, USA). The UC luminescence spectra were collected at room temperature with a Hitachi F-4600 spectrophotometer equipped with an external power-controllable 980 nm semiconductor laser (Beijing Viasho Technology Company, China) as the excitation source.
Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the as-prepared pure Gd2(WO4)3, Gd2(WO4)3:Er3+/Yb3+ and the standard PDF diffraction pattern of Gd2(WO4)3 are shown in Fig. 1(a). All the diffraction peaks of the samples fitted well with the standard data of Gd2(WO4)3 (JCPDS no. 23-1076), indicating that pure Gd2(WO4)3 has been successfully synthesized by the high temperature solid-state reaction method at 1050 °C for 12 h. Besides, the Er3+ and Yb3+ cannot be detected, which shows that the Er3+ and Yb3+ are completely doped in the host lattice,25 and did not change the crystal structure of Gd2(WO4)3.26,27 The measurement of the FT-IR spectra of pure Gd2(WO4)3 is shown in Fig. 1(b). In pure Gd2(WO4)3, the strong absorption peaks corresponding to the vibrations of WO42− groups are between 400 and 1000 cm−1. The absorption bands at around 734 and 837 cm−1 are related to O–W–O stretch vibrations of WO42− tetrahedron.28,29 The 418 and 460 cm−1 band can be attributed to the stretching vibration of W–O.30

The structure of Gd2(WO4)3:3% Er3+, 10% Yb3+ is unknown, and, for the Rietveld refinement, the XRD pattern is indexed by monoclinic cell (C2/c) with parameters close to those of Eu2(WO4)3: (ICSD #15877).31,32 The refinement is stable and gives low R-factors (Table 1, Fig. 2). The atom coordinates and main bond lengths are listed in Tables 2 and 3 respectively. The crystal structure of Gd2(WO4)3:3% Er, 10% Yb is depicted in Fig. 3. As seen from Fig. 3, the coordination number of Gd3+ ions in Gd2(WO4)3 is eight. The ionic radii of Gd3+(CN = 8) = 1.053, while the ionic radii of dopants are IR(Yb3+, CN = 8) = 0.985, IR(Er3+, CN = 8) = 1.004, which are smaller and closer than IR(Gd3+, CN = 8).33 Thus the Gd3+ ions are successfully replaced by Yb3+ and Er3+ ions, which should lead to the host cell parameters shrinkage. The crystallographic data and refinement parameters are shown in Table 1. The cell volume of Gd2(WO4)3:Er3+, Yb3+ is V = 936.65(5) Å3, compared with the stand cell volume of Gd2(WO4)3, V = 938.15 Å3,34 which indicates that the cell volume decrease on the doping by Er3+ and Yb3+.

 Fig. 3  The crystal structure of Gd2(WO4)3:3% Er, 10% Yb. 
The diffuse reflection of pure Gd2(WO4)3, Yb3+ doped Gd2(WO4)3, Er3+ doped Gd2(WO4)3 and Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped Gd2(WO4)3 are shown in Fig. 4. From the figure, pure Gd2(WO4)3 does not show apparent absorption in the range of 300–1200 nm. The Er3+-doped Gd2(WO4)3 possesses strong absorption at 520, 655, 795 nm, while weak absorption at 974 nm is observed. The absorption at 974 nm originated from 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transition of Yb3+ ions is observed in Yb3+-doped Gd2(WO4)3. Yb3+ and Er3+ co-doped Gd2(WO4)3 sample is characterized by the apparent absorption at 520, 655, 795 and 974 nm. From the insets, it is obvious that Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped Gd2(WO4)3 exhibits higher UC efficiency than that of Er3+-doped Gd2(WO4)3, which demonstrates that the increasing absorption at 980 nm of Er3+ is mainly caused by the energy transition of Yb3+ to Er3+.35
 Fig. 4  Diffuse reflection spectra of pure Gd2(WO4)3, Yb3+ doped Gd2(WO4)3, Er3+ doped Gd2(WO4)3 and Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped Gd2(WO4)3, and the inset shows the green luminescence images of the phosphors when irradiated by a 980 nm diode ((a) Er3+ doped Gd2(WO4)3, (b) Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped Gd2(WO4)3). 
The UC luminescence spectra of single Yb3+ doped and xEr3+/0.1Yb3+ (x = 0–0.05) co-doped Gd2(WO4)3 under 980 nm near-infrared laser excitation at room temperature is shown in Fig. 5, and the inset shows the dependence of green UC emission intensity (at 532 nm and 553 nm) on Er3+ concentration. First of all, Yb3+-doped Gd2(WO4)3 does not show the UC luminescence because of activator Er3+ ions absence. Due to concentration quenching effect,36 UC luminescence green emission intensities increase firstly and, then, decrease approaching the maximum at 3 mol% of Er3+ content (Yb3+ concentration was fixed at 10 mol%). In the spectra, two strong green emission bands centered at 532 nm and 553 nm and a weak red emission band centered at around 669 nm are observed, which are assigned to the Er3+ ion transitions of 4H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2, respectively.20,35,37
 Fig. 5  Comparison of UC luminescence spectra of Gd2(WO4)3:xEr3+/0.1Yb3+ under 980 nm laser excitation and the inset shows the intensity of the green emission as a function of Er3+ doping concentration and the enlarged red emission band. 
The UC luminescence spectra of single Er3+ doped and 0.03 Er3+/yYb3+ (y = 0–0.25) co-doped Gd2(WO4)3 under 980 nm near-infrared laser excitation are presented in Fig. 6, and the inset shows the variation of the UC luminescent intensity at 532 nm and 553 nm on the Yb3+ concentration increase. Similarly, when singly doped with Er3+ ion, the UC spectrum includes very weak UC emission, because Er3+ solely can hardly absorb the near-infrared excitation energy in the absence of sensitizer Yb3+ ions. With increasing concentration of Yb3+, the UC emission regions are enhanced. Moreover, it is also found that the two strong green emission bands and one weak red emission band are assigned to the Er3+ ion transitions.
 Fig. 6  Comparison of UC luminescence spectra of Gd2(WO4)3:0.03Er3+/yYb3+ under 980 nm laser excitation. The inset shows the intensity of the green emission as a function of Yb3+ doping concentration. 
The UC mechanism can be explained by the dependence of UC emission intensity (I) on pump power (P), which follows the relation: I ∝ Pn,20,25,38 where n is the pump photon number required for the transition from ground state to upper emitting state. The number n is obtained from the slope of the fitting line of logI versus logP. Fig. 7 shows the UC luminescence spectrum of Gd2(WO4)3:0.03Er3+/0.1Yb3+ with different pump powers, and the double-logarithmic plot of green and red UC emission intensities upon pump powers is shown in the inset. It is obvious that the UC luminescence intensity of the phosphors increases as the pump power increased. The calculated slopes are 2.12, 2.12 for the green emission (532 nm: 4H11/2 → 4I15/2, 553 nm: 4S3/2 → 4I15/2), and 1.48 for the red emission (669 nm: 4F9/2 → 4I15/2), indicating that both green emission and red emission are two-photon process.39–41
 Fig. 7  UC emission spectra of Gd2(WO4)3:0.03Er3+/0.1Yb3+ with different pump power, and the inset shows the dependence of green and red UC emission intensities upon pump power. 
The deviation from the theoretical value 2 for those special two-photon process may be caused by the crystal structure and the defect states inside the bandgap in the energy transition.20,40 The n value lower than 2 for red emission at 669 nm could be due to the large UC rate for the depletion of the intermediate excited states, competition between linear decay, and the local thermal effect as well.25 In the limit of infinitely small UC rates, the UC luminescence intensity for a special n-photon energy transfer tends to be proportional to n-th power of pump power (Pn); while in the limit of infinitely large UC rate, the intensity is proportional to the pump power (P1). Thus, the UC intensity which excited by the sequential absorption of n photons has a dependence of Pβ on pump power, with β ranges from 1 to n.42 Besides, as the excitation power is increased, the slope may decrease, which may due to the self-focusing,43 or the high excitation densities may lead to high non-radiative rates and high temperature in the internal samples, and then, the thermal effect causes the quenching of UC intensity.42
According to the above results, the energy level diagram of the Er3+ and Yb3+ ions and the proposed UC mechanism in Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped Gd2(WO4)3 are illustrated in Fig. 8. Under the 980 nm excitation, Yb3+ ion can be excited by one photon and transferred from the ground state 2F7/2 to the excited state 2F5/2. The Er3+ ion may be excited and transferred from the ground state 4I15/2 to the excited state 4I11/2 through the ground state absorption (GSA), or may be excited though the energy transfer (ET1) from Yb3+ ion. The second step of ET21 can promote an excited state absorption (ESA) of Er3+ from 4I11/2 to the 4F7/2 level.38
 Fig. 8  The energy level diagrams of Er3+ and Yb3+ ions, and the proposed UC mechanism in Gd2(WO4)3:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphors. 
Because of the small energy gap between the 4F7/2, 4H11/2 and 4S3/2, the transition of Er3+ occurred rapidly from the 4F7/2 to the 4H11/2 and 4S3/2 by non-radiative relaxation (NR).35 Finally, the green emissions centered at 532 nm and 553 nm were produced through radiative transitions of 4H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2. The red emission centered at 669 nm was associated with 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 due to the NR from 4S3/2 to the 4F9/2 level or the ET22: 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 4I13/2(Er3+) → 2F7/2(Yb3+) + 4F9/2(Er3+).29
Conclusions
Er3+, Yb3+ single-doped and Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped Gd2(WO4)3 phosphors were successfully synthesized by the high temperature solid-state method at 1050 °C for 12 h. The Er3+ and Yb3+ doping induced the lattice parameters decrease which proved the Gd3+ replacement by Er3+ and Yb3+ ions. Under the 980 nm laser excitation, the Er3+ or Yb3+ single-doped Gd2(WO4)3 samples hardly show the UC luminescence. While the Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped Gd2(WO4)3 phosphors exhibited remarkable green UC emission at 532 and 553 nm and the low-intensity red UC emission at around 669 nm, which were assigned to the characteristic level transition of 4H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 of Er3+ ion, respectively. The optimum Er3+ doping concentration was determined as 3 mol%. With the Yb3+ doping concentration increase, the UC emission intensities of Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped Gd2(WO4)3 enhanced gradually. The power-dependent luminescent properties indicated that the energy transfer existed in both green and red emissions was a two-photon process. Generally, the results of the present study demonstrates that the Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped Gd2(WO4)3 is an efficient green emission UC phosphor.
