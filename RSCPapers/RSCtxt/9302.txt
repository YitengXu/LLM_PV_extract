    , Accepted 4th January 2022First published on 6th January 2022AbstractEfficient singlet fission (SF) materials with relatively high triplet state energy and broadband light harvesting ability simultaneously have a greater advantage for practical application in photovoltaics. Herein, we prepared colloid nanoparticles of an amphipathic anthracene (DPA)–tetracene (DPT) dyad (DPT–DPA–COOH) with broadband light harvesting. The DPA unit compensates the weak absorption of the DPT unit at shorter than 425 nm wavelength via ultrafast (< 1 ps) and quantitative intramolecular singlet Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the DPA unit to the DPT unit. Transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that a fast (∼73 ps) and efficient (ΦT1 = ∼110%) intermolecular SF (xSF) between the adjacent DPT units of the DPT–DPA–COOH molecule in nanoparticles could be initiated by the near-unity intramolecular FRET. The close arrangement between the DPT units enforced by the extra hydrophilic interaction induced by the carboxyl group is the key for achieving efficient xSF. These results suggest that the link of proper singlet energy donor (antennas) to the SF chromophore via covalent bond is a good option for designing xSF materials with broadband light harvesting ability.
Introduction
Singlet fission (SF) is known as a process that could transform a singlet excited state into two triplet excited states after the absorption of one photon,1 which has great potential for enhancing the performance of single-junction solar cells.2–4 When incorporating SF materials into single-junction solar cells, its theoretical limit of power conversion efficiency could be increased from approximately 32% to 45%.5,6 Therefore, much research interests has been attracted throughout the last decade to develop and optimize materials for SF.7,8
Many chromophores, including tetracene,9–12 pentacene,13–21 bodipy,22 carotenoid,23,24 1,3-diphenylibenzofuran,25 diketopyrrolopyrrole,26,27 perylene bisimide,28–31 terrylenediimide,32,33 and their derivatives, have been found to fulfill the thermodynamics condition of SF (ES1 ≥ ET1). A large number of efficient SF systems based on these chromophores have been developed, consisting of solid films, colloidal nanoparticles, concentrated solutions, and covalently-linked molecular oligomers. The investigation of these systems has provided significant insights into the SF mechanism. Two main mechanisms have been revealed, namely, direct mechanism and indirect mechanism, in which the formation of the two triplets was intermediated by a real or virtual charge-transfer state7,34,35 or a coherent superposition state.36
As can be seen, many breakthroughs have been made in the development of efficient SF materials and the illustration of the SF mechanism in recent years. However, to date, the application of SF materials into solar cells is still not successful. Only few examples have shown an over 100% external quantum efficiency but the enhancement of the overall photoelectric conversion efficiency is nearly negligible.37,38 To achieve maximum gain for the photoelectric conversion efficiency of photovoltaic device capable of SF materials, developing efficient SF materials with both broad light harvesting in the overall solar spectrum (especially high-energy photons) and relatively high triplet state energy may be an alternative choice. To broaden the light response range of SF materials, Guldi's group recently constructed a series of multichromophores SF systems containing subphthalocyanines and pentacene dimer.39–41 Subphthalocyanines act as energy antennae and donors, and transmit their singlet state energy to pentacene dimer via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism to trigger SF. Due to the complementary absorption of subphthalocyanines and pentacene dimer, the panchromatic activation of molecular SF was achieved. However, the triplet state energy of pentacene is relatively low (∼0.8 eV), which limits its practical application to some extent.
Tetracene derivatives have a relatively high triplet state energy (∼1.2 eV) but its absorption is mainly focused on 425–500 nm, and photons with relatively high energy (<400 nm) cannot be absorbed. Inspired by the works of Guldi's group, we synthesized an amphipathic anthracene–tetracene dyad (DPT–DPA–COOH, Scheme 1) in which the absorption of the anthracene unit and the tetracene unit is complementary and is from 325 nm to 525 nm, containing near ultraviolet region and high-energy portion of the visible region. In solution, the DPA unit absorbs photons, and then transmits its singlet state energy to the DPT unit via ultrafast intramolecular FRET (<1 ps) with a quantitative yield. However, intramolecular singlet heterofission in it is strongly endothermic (ES1 = 2.50 eV, 2ET1 = ET1,Ant + ET1,Tet = 1.8 eV + 1.2 eV = 3.0 eV, ES1 < 2ET1) and cannot occur. When preparing DPT–DPA–COOH into colloidal nanoparticles in water, efficient intermolecular singlet homofission between adjacent DPT units was triggered by the ultrafast singlet FRET process.

Experimental section
General methods

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300 or 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with chemical shifts reported in ppm (TMS as the internal standard). MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded with a Bruker/ultraflex instrument. The absorption spectra were measured on a Hitachi U-9300 spectrophotometer. The steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 with three-monochromator spectrophotometer and three photomultiplier detectors. The emission spectra were corrected for the wavelength dependence of the sensitivity of the detection system. The fluorescence lifetimes were measured on FLS980 with time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method by excitation with a 441 nm picosecond laser (EPL 445). Time resolution for time-resolved fluorescence spectrum is 50 ps. The absolute fluorescence quantum yields were measured with an integrating sphere. The solvents used for preparing the solutions for photophysical measurement were degassed first by Freeze–Pump–Thaw method prior to use.
Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
Ultrafast femtosecond transient absorption measurements were made using a regenerative amplified Ti: sapphire laser system from Coherent (800 nm, 100 fs, 6 mJ pulse−1, and 1 kHz repetition rate). The pump beam was set at 460 and 360 nm. A beam splitter is used to divide the output pulse (800 nm) of the regenerative amplifier into two parts. A wavelength-tunable pump beam from 250 nm to 2.5 μm was generated from a TOPAS Optical Parametric Amplifier (OPA) pumped by reflected light from the output pulse of the regenerative amplifier. The white-light probe extending in the range of 350–800 nm was produced by focusing a small portion of the transmitted beam onto a rotating CaF2 plate. Spectral and dynamic data were recorded with a CCD detector and an 8 ns pump–probe delay line. The pump pulse was kept in a weak regime, where the excitonic annihilation effect can be neglected.

Synthesis of DPT–DPA–COOH
A mixture of compounds 5 (690 mg, 1 mmol) and KOH (2 g, 5 mmol) was added to a dry round-bottomed flask. Argon was pumped three times to remove oxygen from the reactor, and then THF (80 mL), methanol (80 mL), and H2O (30 mL) was added. The resulted solution was heated to 60 °C and reacted in the dark for 8 h. After the reaction, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and then 40 mL HCl solution (2 mol L−1) was added for acidification for 5 h. Sodium bicarbonate was added for neutralization, and then the solution was transferred to a separatory funnel containing dichloromethane (50 mL) and water (100 mL) to separate the organic layer. The crude product obtained after drying with anhydrous MgSO4 was purified by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol = 10/1) to obtain an orange solid, 608.4 mg, with 90% yield. 1H NMR (400 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 8.58 (s, 1H), 8.43–8.37 (m, 3H), 8.11 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 1H), 8.04 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 1H), 7.97 (dd, J = 9.0, 4.2 Hz, 2H), 7.83 (p, J = 8.3, 7.6 Hz, 5H), 7.72 (q, J = 7.9, 5.8 Hz, 7H), 7.63 (d, J = 7.3 Hz, 2H), 7.55 (d, J = 11.4 Hz, 3H), 7.49–7.42 (m, 3H), 7.37 (td, J = 13.0, 10.9, 6.1 Hz, 4H); MS (ESI): m/z: calculated: 676.24; found: 676.08; elemental analysis (%), calculated for C51H32O2: C 90.51, H 4.77; found: C 90.49, H 4.75.
Results and discussion
Molecular design and synthesis
Tetracene has a relatively high triplet state energy (1.2 eV) and has a great application potential in photovoltaic cells, which could be seen from the ability to sensitize silicon cell.44 To maximize the gain for photoelectric conversion efficiency, broadening its light response in the overall solar spectrum may be an alternative choice. Thus, a complementary chromophore (DPA unit) absorbed in the range of 325 and 425 nm was linked to the DPT unit (main absorption is located in the range from 425 and 525 nm) via covalent bond. The excitation energy of the DPA unit could be transferred to the DPT unit via ultrafast singlet FRET, and acts as the antenna. In addition, the carboxyl group was attached onto the DPA unit of DPT–DPA–COOH. In this way, due to the strong hydrophilicity of the carboxyl group, the DPA unit was mainly distributed in the outer layer of the DPT–DPA–COOH nanoparticles to act as the antenna for harvesting high-energy photons.
The synthesis of DPT–DPA–COOH is shown in Scheme 1. We first synthesized the intermediate, compound 2, via the Suzuki coupling between compound 1 and 4-(methoxycarbonyl)benzeneboronic acid. Then, compound 2 reacted with bis(pinacolato)diboron to get compound 3. The tetracene intermediate, compound 4, was synthesized according to our previous reports.42 Under the condition of Suzuki coupling, compound 4 coupled with compound 3 to get compound 5. At last, DPT–DPA–COOH was obtained by the hydrolysis of compound 5.
Nanoparticle preparation and characterization
DPT–DPA–COOH nanoparticles were prepared by the re-precipitation method.27,45 At room temperature, 1.56 mg DPT–DPA–COOH was dissolved in degassed THF (1 mL), and then 0.4 mL of the solution was added into 10 mL of the rapidly stirred deionized water in the glove box, which was stirred in dark for 4 h until the absorption spectrum of the suspension of the nanoparticles was unchanged. An orange DPT–DPA–COOH nanoparticle (NP) suspension in water was obtained. The average size of DPT–DPA–COOH NP is ∼200 nm, as revealed by the dynamic light scattering experiment (Fig. S1, ESI†). In addition, the water contact angle of DPT–DPA–COOH NP (77.1°) is much smaller than that of the DPT–DPA–COOH film (113.4°) prepared by the spin-coating of a THF solution of DPT–DPA–COOH onto a quartz plate, suggesting that the surface of DPA–COOH NP is hydrophilic. This is consistent with our previous observation in which the carboxyl group points outward from the nanoparticles due to the strong hydrophilic interaction between the carboxyl groups and water.46 In other words, the carboxyl group should point outward from DPT–DPA–COOH NP. This extra hydrophilic driving force would make the DPA unit of DPT–DPA–COOH approximate to the DPA unit of adjacent DPA–COOH instead of the DPT unit in nanoparticles.
Steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra

Fig. 1 shows the absorption and fluorescence of DPT–DPA–COOH in THF and nanoparticle suspension as well as their corresponding monomers (DPA and DPT) in THF. The absorption spectrum of DPT–DPA–COOH shows two main absorption ranges in THF, namely, 325–425 nm and 425–515 nm (Fig. 1a). These two absorption ranges are close to the absorption position of DPA and DPT in THF, respectively, and so attributed to the DPA and DPT unit of DPT–DPA–COOH. Besides, the absorption band of DPA and DPT unit in DPT–DPA–COOH is redshifted slightly compared to that of the corresponding DPA and DPT in THF, indicating the presence of extremely weak ground-state interaction between the DPA and DPT unit in DPT–DPA–COOH.
 Fig. 1  Steady-state absorption (A) and fluorescence (B) spectra of DPT–DPA–COOH in THF and nanoparticles. 
The emission band of DPA is mainly located at 400–500 nm (Fig. 1b). The fluorescence spectrum of DPT shows three main emission bands at 503, 536, and 574 nm. When we selectively excited the DPA unit of DPT–DPA–COOH with a 360 nm excitation light in THF, its fluorescence spectrum mainly shows the emission feature of DPT unit (Fig. 1b) but the emission band of DPA unit is very weak. Furthermore, the fluorescence quantum yield of DPT–DPA–COOH (76%) is approximated to that of DPT (70%)42 but is much smaller than that of DPA (90%) (Table 1).47 These results suggest that the emission of the DPA unit in DPT–DPA–COOH is almost quenched completely and replaced by the DPT emission. Considering the strong overlap between the emission spectrum of DPA and the absorption spectrum of DPT (Fig. S2, ESI†), the quenching of DPA emission in DPT–DPA–COOH is probably caused by the singlet FRET process from the DPA unit to the DPT unit.

When DPT–DPA–COOH was converted into colloidal nanoparticles, the absorption band of the DPA unit and the DPT unit was redshifted compared to that in THF (Fig. 1a), suggesting the presence of intermolecular interaction in DPT–DPA–COOH NP. Based on the above discussion, the interaction in DPT–DPA–COOH NP should be dominated by homo-intermolecular interaction between the DPA units or DPT units of the adjacent DPT–DPA–COOH molecules. Similar fluorescence spectrum was observed in the nanoparticles compared to that in THF when excited at 360 nm (Fig. 1b). The DPA emission is also almost quenched completely, suggesting that the singlet FRET process from the DPA unit to DPT unit is still presented in the nanoparticles. However, the dominant DPT emission shows a redshift (∼10 nm), which should result from the intermolecular interaction. The well-structured emission band suggests that no excimer state is formed in the nanoparticles because the excimer state generally exhibits a broad and structureless emission band.48,49 Notably, the fluorescence quantum yield of DPT–DPA–COOH NP is only 6%, which drops significantly in comparison with that in THF. More importantly, the fluorescence of the DPT unit of DPT–DPA–COOH NP shows a non-exponential decay with a fast decay component (∼0.86 ns) and a slow decay component (∼18.62 ns) (Fig. 2). The lifetime of the long-lived component is longer than that of the DPT unit (∼12 ns) in THF. This is unlike the single-exponential decay (∼12 ns) of the DPT unit of DPT–DPA–COOH in THF. These results indicate the presence of a fast non-radiative process that quenches the fluorescence of the DPT unit of DPT–DPA–COOH in the nanoparticles. The fluorescence behavior of the DPT–DPA–COOH nanoparticles is similar with that observation in nanoparticles of some tetracene derivatives, in which the non-radiative process was assigned to SF.46 Thus, DPT–DPA–COOH may also undergo SF in the nanoparticles. The fast decay component was caused by the occurrence of SF, and the slow decay component was attributed to the delayed fluorescence that resulted from the recombination of the geminate triplet states.

Femtosecond transient absorption spectra
To carefully examine the excited-state dynamics of DPT–DPA–COOH in THF and the nanoparticles, we measured their femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectra (Fig. 3) as well as their corresponding monomers (DPA and DPT) (Fig. S3, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S3a (ESI†), the photo-induced bleaching (PIB) band of DPA in THF was mainly located at 405–468 nm with the main peak at ∼435 nm, which is close to its fluorescence band (Fig. 1); thus, this PIB band was originated from stimulated emission (SE). A strong photo-induced absorption band (PIA) at ∼375 nm and a weak broad PIA band in the 484–700 nm region with the main peak at ∼580 nm were detected. These two PIA bands are attributed to the absorption of the singlet (S1) state of DPA based on the previous report.50,51 With time delay, these two S1 absorption bands showed an increase within the first ∼20 ps, as revealed by single-wavelength dynamics probed at ∼375 and ∼580 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†), which should be caused by vibrational cooling and rotation of the two phenyl rings at 9,10-position of DPA in the S1 state.52 Then, the S1 state decayed directly into the ground state with a time constant of ∼7.2 ns (Fig. S4, ESI†), which is consistent with its fluorescence lifetime (7.54 ns) (Table 1). Three PIB bands at ∼465, ∼496, and ∼540 nm were observed in the TA spectra of DPT in THF (Fig. S3b, ESI†). The PIB bands at 465 and 540 nm are attributed to the ground-state bleaching (GSB) and SE, respectively. The other PIB band at 496 nm should be the superposition of the GSB and the SE band. Two PIA bands at ∼417 nm and 588–700 nm region (the main peak at ∼650 nm) were detected, which is corresponding to the S1 state absorption.42,53 Similarly, an increase in the intensity of the S1 absorption at 417 nm was detected within 50 ps (Fig. S5, ESI†), which should also be brought by vibrational cooling and rotation of the two phenyl rings at the 5,12-position of DPT in the S1 state.

Fig. 3 shows the fs-TA spectra of DPT–DPA–COOH in THF excited at 360 nm. Upon photoexcitation, the spectra showed three main PIA bands at ∼375, ∼416, and ∼515–700 nm (the main peak at ∼570 nm) (Fig. 3a). The PIA band at ∼416 nm is close to the position of the S1 absorption of DPT (Fig. S3b, ESI†), and thus should be ascribed to the S1 absorption of the DPT unit of DPT–DPA–COOH. The PIA band at ∼375 nm should be attributed to the S1 absorption of the DPA unit of DPT–DPA–COOH due to the similar position to the S1 absorption of the DPA molecule (Fig. S3a, ESI†). The PIA band at ∼515–700 nm should be the superposition of the S1 absorption for DPT and the DPA unit of DPT–DPA–COOH but the S1 absorption of the DPA unit is dominant. The presence of both S1 absorption of DPA and DPT unit upon photoexcitation suggests that the DPA and DPT unit of DPT–DPA–COOH could be both excited at 360 nm. However, the intensity of the S1 absorption of the DPA unit is obviously higher than that of the DPT unit, which is consistent with the stronger absorption of the DPA unit at 360 nm compared to that of the DPT unit based on their steady-absorption spectra (Fig. 1a). With the increase in time, the intensity of the S1 absorption of the DPA unit at ∼375 nm decreased gradually, accompanied by the rise of the S1 absorption of the DPT unit at ∼416 nm within 1 ps. Meanwhile, the S1 absorption peak of the DPA unit at ∼570 nm was redshifted to ∼600 nm. This new absorption band at ∼600 nm is close to that of DPT (Fig. S3b, ESI†), which should be originated from the DPT unit of DPT–DPA–COOH. However, when the DPT unit of DPT–DPA–COOH was excited selectively at ∼460 nm, only the S1 absorption of the DPT unit could be identified and its intensity is nearly unchanged within 1 ps (Fig. S6, ESI†). This suggests that the rise of the absorption of the DPT unit of DPT–DPA–COOH is not caused by the DPT unit itself when excited at ∼360 nm. Instead, it should be caused by the singlet FRET from the DPA unit to the DPT unit in DPT–DPA–COOH. Notably, the singlet FRET in DPT–DPA–COOH is ultrafast and nearly complete within 1 ps, as revealed by single-wavelength dynamics probed at ∼380 and ∼417 nm (Fig. 3c). From the fitting result of the dynamics probed at ∼417 nm, singlet FRET rate was estimated to be ∼0.2 ps. The ultrafast singlet FRET is attributed to the strong spectral overlap (J) between the fluorescence of DPA and the absorption of DPT,54 and is consistent with the previous report of some heterodimers consisting of different acenes.55–57 After the singlet FRET process, the intensity of the S1 absorption of the DPT unit at ∼417 nm has a slight increase within 50 ps (Fig. 3b and c), which is similar with the observation in the DPT molecule and should also be attributed to vibrational cooling and rotation of the two phenyl rings in the S1 state. Then, the S1 state of the DPT unit decays directly to the ground state without any additional spectral evolution.
As for the DPT–DPA–COOH nanoparticles, the S1 absorption feature of the DPA unit and the DPT unit could also be observed immediately upon photoexcitation at 360 nm (Fig. 4a). As the time increases, the S1 absorption intensity of the DPT unit at ∼424 nm also shows a significant enhancement with the decrease of the S1 absorption of DPA unit at ∼372 nm within 1 ps (Fig. 4a and c). Meanwhile, the S1 absorption of the DPA unit at ∼590 nm is redshifted gradually to ∼630 nm corresponding to the S1 absorption of the DPT unit. The similar spectral evolution in the nanoparticles compared to that of DPT–DPA–COOH in THF confirms that the singlet FRET from the DPA unit to the DPT unit is also proceeded in the DPT–DPA–COOH nanoparticles. Furthermore, the singlet FRET rate is comparable to that in THF as revealed by single-wavelength dynamics probed at ∼372 and ∼424 nm (Fig. 4c). After the singlet energy transfer, the S1 absorption of the DPT unit shows a fast decay within 100 ps, which is significantly different from that in THF where the S1 absorption has no decrease in the same time range. This means that there is an extra process to quench the S1 state of the DPT unit compared to that in THF, which agrees well with the strong quenching of the fluorescence in the nanoparticles. Concurrently, an increase is observed in the absorption at ∼487 nm that is the typical spectral feature of the triplet state for DPT derivatives.42 In other words, the triplet state of the DPT unit is formed in the DPT–DPA–COOH nanoparticles with the decay of the S1 state of the DPT unit. Furthermore, the formation of the triplet state is finished completely within 100 ps, as deduced from single-wavelength dynamics probed at ∼424 and ∼487 nm, which is much faster than that of intersystem crossing in DPT derivatives.58 Thus, the triplet state of the DPT units should be originated from SF, which is an alternative way to generate the triplet state.1 In addition, no spectral feature of the cation or anion of DPA and DPT was observed,59 which excludes the possibility of the formation of the charge-transfer state. This, together with the absence of the formation of the excimer state and the fast formation of the triplet state suggests that the extra quenching process of the S1 state of the DPT unit in the nanoparticles is SF. With the time further increasing, the S1 absorption of DPT unit is fully vanished within 1.5 ns, and the triplet absorption at ∼487 nm is redshifted to ∼493 nm. The resulting triplet spectrum matches well with the triplet spectrum of DPT–DPA–COOH NP obtained from the sensitization experiment (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†), and no triplet signal of DPA could be observed in the overall SF process.60 Therefore, SF should be occurred between the adjacent DPT units instead of the adjacent DPT unit and DPA unit or the adjacent DPA units. In addition, when the DPT unit of DPT–DPA–COOH in the nanoparticles was selectively excited at 460 nm, the similar formation process of the triplet state of the DPT unit was also observed (Fig. S9, ESI†), which again confirms that SF is conducted between the adjacent DPT units. Then, the triplet state of the DPT unit decays into ground state without new spectral evolution.

Analysis of the excited-state dynamics
As discussed above, ultrafast intramolecular singlet FRET (<1 ps) could be proceeded from the DPA unit to the DPT unit in DPT–DPA–COOH whether in THF or nanoparticles. Except this, a parasitic process, intermolecular SF (xSF), could also occur between the adjacent DPT units after the intramolecular singlet FRET process in the DPT–DPA–COOH nanoparticles. However, xSF is absent in THF solution of DPT–DPA–COOH. Based on this, we performed global analysis for the TA data to get species-associated spectra and dynamics within the glotaran software using a three-(S1,DPA → S1,DPT → S′1,DPT) or four-component (S1,DPA → S1,DPT → ME → T1) decay model for DPT–DPA–COOH in THF and nanoparticles, respectively, and is shown in Fig. 5.61 The fitting result matches well with the raw data (Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†), suggesting that the decay model employed by us is reliable. In THF, the spectrum of the first-component is mainly featured by the S1 absorption of DPA (Fig. S3, ESI†); thus, we ascribed the first component to the S1 state of the DPA unit (S1,DPA) of DPT–DPA–COOH. Then, the S1 state of the DPA unit converted into the second-component with a time constant of ∼0.2 ps. The second-component should be originated from the S1 state of the DPT unit (S1,DPT) based on its same absorption feature to that of DPT (Fig. S3b, ESI†). The S1 state of the DPT unit evolved into the third component with a time constant of 19 ps. However, the spectrum of the third component has nearly no change compared to that of the S1 state of the DPT unit except the slight increase in the intensity of the S1 absorption at ∼414 nm, which should be attributed to vibrational cooling and structural relaxation. In other words, the third component is the structurally relaxed S1 state of the DPT unit (S′1,DPT). The structural relaxed S1 state of the DPT unit decays to the ground state with a lifetime of 11 ns, which is consistent with the fluorescence lifetime of DPT–DPA–COOH in THF.
 Fig. 5  Species-associated spectra (a and c) and dynamics (b and d) of DPT–DPA–COOH in THF (a and b) and nanoparticles (c and d). 
In the nanoparticles, the spectra of the first- and second component are similar to the corresponding spectrum in THF; so the first and second component is assigned to the S1 state of the DPA and DPT units, respectively. Then, the S1 state of the DPT unit evolves into the third-component with a time constant of 3.4 ps. The spectrum of the third-component shows a decreased S1 absorption intensity of the DPT unit and an increased T1 absorption of the DPT unit at ∼487 nm, which is similar to the spectral feature of the triplet pair state (1(TT)) observed in the concentrated solution of TIPS-tetracene that possesses both the S1 and T1 characteristics.62 Thus, we assigned this state to the 1(TT) state. Next, the 1(TT) state transfers into the last state possessing the same spectral feature of the T1 state of the DPT derivatives with a time constant of 73 ps;42 thus, the last state is assigned to the T1 state of the DPT unit. This time constant is close to that of SF in the DPT film60 but is faster than that in the DPT nanoparticles. The T1 state shows a lifetime of 5.1 ns, which is much shorter than that of the sensitized T1 state. This fact suggests the geminate triplet–triplet annihilation to reform S0 as the dominant triplet decay pathway. This, in turn, confirms that the T1 state is originated from SF.
At last, the T1 yield of the DPT–DPA–COOH nanoparticles was calculated by the ground-state bleaching method.64,65 The quantum yield of the T1 state is ∼110%, which is close to that in the DPT film63 but is higher than that in the DPT nanoparticles.66 The faster and more efficient SF in the DPT–DPA–COOH nanoparticles compared to the DPT nanoparticles indicates that the extra drive force induced by the introduction of the carboxyl group could lead to a DPT unit packing more favorable for the occurrence of SF. In addition, a qualitative depiction of the excited-state process involved in the THF solution or the nanoparticles of DPT–DPA–COOH is given in Fig. 6.

Conclusions
We have successfully prepared nanoparticles of an amphipathic anthracene (DPA)–tetracene (DPT) dyad (DPT–DPA–COOH) with broadband light harvesting ability (325–525 nm), especially high-energy photons. Ultrafast (<1 ps) and quantitative intramolecular singlet FRET could be conducted from the DPA unit to the DPT unit, and then triggered fast (∼73 ps) and efficient xSF (ΦT1∼110%) between the DPT units of the neighboring DPT–DPA–COOH in the nanoparticles. This indicates that introducing proper energy donors (antenna) onto the SF chromophore via covalent bond may be a good choice for preparing xSF materials with wide absorption range. Our result provides an effective design strategy toward efficient xSF materials with broadband light harvesting ability for application into future SF-based solar cells.
