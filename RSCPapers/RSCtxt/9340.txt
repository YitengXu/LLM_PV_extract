The as-fabricated battery presents feasible solar rechargeable capability.
Electrochemical rechargeable batteries are the most efficient systems for energy conversion and storage.1 Unlike the conventional conversion between electrical energy and chemical energy from fossil sources, solar energy is environmentally benign, abundant, and renewable. Solar cells are efficient devices that can convert solar energy to electrical energy, thanks to various photovoltaic technologies. Such solar-generated electrical energy can be stored in external rechargeable batteries, such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) or metal hydride/nickel (MH/Ni) batteries.2 Therefore, solar storable rechargeable batteries, in which the solar energy can be converted and stored directly, are highly desired for the utilization of solar energy.
Usually, solar storable devices are fabricated based on a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) with dye-sensitized TiO2 photo-anode, counter electrode, and charge storage electrode. Herein, the charge storage electrode is responsible for photo-generated electron storage, such as lithium intercalation electrodes of WO33,4 and polypyrrole (PPy),5 or carbon capacitor electrode.6 In addition, solar storable devices can be also fabricated with polymeric hole-transport/electron-storage electrodes,7 or organic photovoltaic/supercapacitor components.8 In such solar storable devices, the charge storage electrodes are composed of solid-state compounds or polymers. As pointed out by Aziz and Rugolo,9 such solid-electrode batteries have too little energy to power ratio for intermittent renewable energy storage, such as wind and solar energy. In contrast, redox flow batteries, with a pair of redox species dissolved in two separate liquid electrolytes, have a significant advantage in terms of mass energy storage.9–11 If the energy conversion and storage from solar energy to electrical energy can be carried out in a redox flow cell, this would offer a new method for solar-generated electricity storage. In this communication, we propose a solar rechargeable redox flow battery based on Li2WO4/LiI couples in dual-phase electrolyte. The current study shows that this new configuration of the solar rechargeable redox flow battery in dual-phase electrolytes is feasible for solar energy to electrical energy conversion and storage.
The configuration and working mechanism of the solar rechargeable redox flow cell in dual-phase electrolytes are illustrated in Fig. 1. During the photo-charge process, the photo-anode (A) and the Pt/Ti mesh electrode (C) are short-circuited. Under light illumination, the photo-generated electrons, originating from the photo-excited dye (N719), are injected into the conduction band of TiO2, and pass through the external circuit to the Pt/Ti mesh electrode (C). Lithium ions are simultaneously intercalated into soluble anode-active Li2WO4 in aqueous electrolyte (anolyte) on the surface of the Pt/Ti mesh electrode for counterbalancing the injected negative charges, while lithium ions diffuse from organic electrolyte (catholyte) to aqueous electrolyte through the lithium ionic conducting membrane. In the meantime, the excited dye on the surface of TiO2 is rapidly reduced to its ground state through accepting electrons from soluble I−, which is oxidized to soluble I3− in organic electrolyte, accompanied by the release of lithium ions. In the fully charged state, cathode and anode active materials exist as I3− and Li2+xWO4, respectively. As a result, the photo-generated electrons are continuously produced and stored in the triiodide ions and Li2+xWO4, respectively. Such soluble cathode/anode-active species can flow to the anode and cathode storage devices, respectively. In the discharge process, two Pt/Ti mesh electrodes (B and C) are closed, while the photo-anode (A) is opened. Lithium ions are de-intercalated from Li2+xWO4 anode for releasing electrons, which flow via an external load to the cathode, where I3− is reduced to I−. Meanwhile, lithium ions diffuse from aqueous electrolyte to organic electrolyte through the lithium ionic conducting membrane. In the fully discharged state, cathode and anode active materials are converted back to the initial states of I− and Li2WO4, respectively. In photo-charge and electrochemical discharge processes, cell reactions may be written as: (1) (2)
 Fig. 1  Scheme of the configuration and working mechanism of the solar rechargeable redox flow battery in dual-phase electrolytes. In the battery, Li2WO4 is used as anode in aqueous electrolyte (0.1 M Li2WO4 and 0.2 M LiClO4 in H2O), LiI is used as cathode in organic electrolyte (0.1 M LiI and 0.5 M TBP in propylene carbonate), and LISICON lithium-ion-conducting glass ceramic film is used as membrane to separate liquid anode/cathode-active species. The Pt/Ti mesh is used as working electrode for the electrochemical reaction of two soluble anode/cathode-active species. 
To verify the working mechanism, cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of soluble cathode/anode-active species were measured and are shown in Fig. 2. In CVs of the cathode-active LiI in organic electrolyte, there are two pairs of redox peaks at 0.21/−0.27 V and −0.19/−0.58 V (vs. Ag/Ag+), respectively, corresponding to a two-step reversible electrochemical reaction.4,12,13 In particular, the anodic oxidation peak of the dye (N719) appears at 0.38 V (vs. Ag/Ag+), much higher than the cathodic reduction potential (−0.58 V) of the cathode-active LiI. Thus, I− can be completely oxidized to I3− near a high potential of 0.38 V during the photo-charge process. Li2WO4 is hygroscopic and has a good dissolvability in aqueous solution.14 In aqueous electrolyte, the cathodic and anodic peaks of the anode-active Li2WO4 appear at −0.16 and 0.26 V (vs. SCE), respectively. The potential of the conduction band edge of TiO2 in aprotic solvents (about −0.68 V vs. Ag/Ag+, or −0.46 V vs. NHE)7,15 is more negative than the reduction potential (−0.16 V, vs. SCE, or 0.08 V, vs. NHE) of the anode-active Li2WO4 in aqueous solution, demonstrating a viable transport of the photo-generated electrons from the TiO2 photo-anode to the anode-active Li2WO4 through the external circuit during the photo-charge reaction. Therefore, in principle, the working mechanism of the solar rechargeable redox flow battery in dual-phase electrolyte would be feasible in terms of the energy level or potential.

To further verify the feasibility of the solar rechargeable redox flow battery system, the battery was photo-charged under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation for 10 min with a flow rate of 0.05 mL min−1, and then discharged in the dark by connecting the B–C circuit to allow a constant current of 0.075 mA cm−2 to flow through. As shown in Fig. 3, after photo-charging for 10 min, the voltage of the battery rapidly reaches 0.76 V, indicating that the solar energy can be converted to chemical energy, which is stored in the soluble redox couples (I3− and Li2+xWO4) in the cathode and anode storage devices, respectively. In principle, the photo-charge process in the solar rechargeable redox flow battery is different from the electrochemical charge process in conventional secondary batteries, in the latter the battery voltage rises gradually due to the continuous oxidation reaction in the cathode and the reduction reaction in the anode under galvanostatic conditions. In the solar rechargeable redox flow battery, the current drops sharply from the maximum value with increasing photo-charge time.13 In particular, the anode-active Li2WO4 on the Pt/Ti mesh electrode receives the photo-generated electrons from the conduction band of TiO2, presenting the constant-voltage charging characteristics on the anode side in aqueous electrolyte. Therefore, the battery voltage climbs rapidly to 0.76 V within about 2 min, and then the flat voltage plateau appears afterwards, which corresponds to the difference between the oxidation potential of the I−/I3− couple and the conduction band level of TiO2. After photo-charging, the battery can be galvanostatically discharged in the dark, producing electrical energy converted from chemical energy. In the subsequent typical discharge process, a sloped discharge curve of the battery is observed with the average working voltage of 0.45 V, corresponding to the average potential difference between the I−/I3− redox couple and the Li2WO4/Li2+xWO4 redox couple. The initial discharge capacity of the battery is 0.0153 mA h mL−1, with the cut-off voltage at 0.2 V. In particular, the battery is able to work in repeated photo-charge and electrochemical discharge processes. A discharge capacity of 0.0151 mA h mL−1 is retained after 10 cycles, demonstrating the good stability of the solar rechargeable flow battery system.

(b) Discharge capacities vs. cycle number during 10 cycles. 
Theoretically, the electrochemical reaction and diffusion of the active species in liquid are much faster than in solid. This feature makes the solar rechargeable flow battery unique in rate discharge capability in response to the power requirement. As illustrated in Fig. 4, after photo-charging for 10 min, the battery delivers a high voltage plateau at the low current density of 0.025 mA cm−2, while the low and sloped discharge voltage curve is shown at the high current density of 0.125 mA cm−2, indicating that the polarization is large at the high current density due to the low ion conductivity (10−4 S cm−1) of the lithium-ion-conducting glass ceramic membrane. Of course, the maximum discharge capacity of 0.0140 mA h mL−1 is still retained after pre-activation at the high current density of 0.125 mA cm−2, which is almost 71.8% of the maximum capacity (0.0195 mA h mL−1) at the optimized current density of 0.075 mA cm−2. It is also shown in Fig. 4b that there is an optimized current density for reaching the maximum discharge capacity. When discharged at the high current density (0.125 mA cm−2), the discharge capacity is lower due to the large polarization as mentioned above. However, the discharge capacity is still unsatisfactory at the low current density (0.025 mA cm−2), which could be probably attributed to the low energy efficiency of the redox flew battery.16 Meanwhile, the battery system can be also operated with varying flow rates of the electrolyte and photo-charge times (Fig. S1 and S2†). In particular, the discharge capacity of the battery gradually increases with increasing the photo-charge time, and reaches a constant value when the photo-charge time is long enough,2,5 implying that the battery performance can be further adjusted or improved.

(b) Discharge capacities vs. cycle number during 10 cycles at different current densities. 
Based on the working mechanism analysis and the experimental results shown above, the solar rechargeable redox flow battery can be realized as long as the dye and soluble anode/cathode-active species are carefully selected to be photo-electrochemically compatible. In addition, the dual-phase electrolytes used here are favorable for selecting anode/cathode-active species to match the redox potential with the dye.
In summary, a solar rechargeable redox flow battery is fabricated with dye-sensitized TiO2 as photo-anode, soluble Li2WO4 as anode-active species in aqueous electrolyte, LiI as cathode-active species in organic electrolyte, and LISICON lithium-ion-conducting glass ceramic film as membrane. The as-fabricated battery presents feasible solar energy to chemical energy conversion at light illumination and subsequent discharge ability in the dark, offer the possibility for developing new battery systems for solar energy conversion and storage.
