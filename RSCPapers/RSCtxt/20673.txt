    , Accepted 26th January 2016First published on 26th January 2016AbstractWe report a novel strategy to collect microporous carbon from disposable sugarcane waste for lithium ion battery (LIB) applications. First boiled in water and ethanol and then calcined, the sugarcane waste successfully transforms into microporous carbon, delivering a specific capacity of 311 mA h g−1 at 0.33C as a LIB anode material. For improved LIB performance, pyrrhotite-5T Fe1−xS nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed and robustly attached to the scaffold of the microporous carbon using a novel sulfurization method. A remarkably ultrahigh capacity of 1185 mA h g−1 (well beyond the theoretical value by 576 mA h g−1) was achieved after 200 charging/discharging cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1, suggesting desirable synergetic effects between Fe1−xS and microporous carbon which lead to a shortened lithium ion transportation path, enhanced conductivity and effective prevention of polysulfide dissolution. Our approach opens a convenient route for mass-producing sustainable, superior LIB electrodes from natural wastes that can substitute commercial graphite.
Introduction
Alarmed by global warming and the energy crisis, intensive efforts have been devoted to developing sustainable energy technologies (solar, wind, geothermal and tidal energy).1 Among different energy storage systems for effectively storing intermittent natural energy, rechargeable lithium ion batteries are one of the most promising candidates.2–4 For example, they are particularly appealing for portable electronic devices and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) due to their high energy density (high voltage joined with high specific capacity, typically at 150 W h kg−1 and 650 W h l−1), high rate capability, and long lifespan.5–8 Nevertheless, the high price of LIBs largely restricts their wide application, particularly in HEVs, making the development of HEV-based green transportation unrealistic. In fact, how to effectively lower the manufacturing cost, enhance the safety, increase the lifetime, and improve the energy density are the major challenges of LIBs presented to scientists.9,10 Currently, the anode materials of commercial LIBs heavily rely on graphite, which possesses low energy capacities and mainly comes from natural graphite mines, imposing environmental stress and the threat of depleting the natural graphite reserves to meet the huge future demands from the electric vehicle and electricity grid industries. It is therefore an urgent task for scientists to discover new renewable electrode materials that are environment friendly, cheap and with nearly infinite abundance in nature.10,11
Sugarcane as a type of popular plant, is widely grown in tropical and subtropical regions. Brazil is the largest producer of sugarcane in the world, followed by the next five major producers of India, China, Thailand, Pakistan and Mexico. As estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, sugarcane is cultivated on ∼26.0 million hectares all over the world, in more than 90 countries, producing a worldwide harvest of 1.83 billion tons.12 It is noteworthy that ∼60% of commercial sugar comes from sugarcane. Notably, after draining the juice, the sugarcane trunks are normally discarded, resulting in a huge amount of bio-waste (up to ∼223 million tons per year) that needs to be disposed of, usually through either direct combustion or landfills for biodegradation, generating air pollution.13 The direct combustion treatment inevitably emits nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), CO2, and sulfur oxides (SOX),14 which are main contributors to the haze weather seen recently in China.15 Landfill treatment could be a more suitable method of disposal, but it entails large economic consumption. Thus, a more convenient and environmentally friendly approach that can effectively convert huge amounts of disposable sugarcane waste into useful commercial products would be highly desirable. Note that nano-porous activated carbon16 and hierarchically porous carbon monoliths17 have been obtained from sugarcane waste for supercapacitor applications. Nonetheless, the application of sugarcane waste-derived microporous carbon for lithium-ion batteries has not been reported.
Herein, we report a new convenient mass-production strategy to convert sugarcane waste into microporous carbon for lithium-ion batteries. Following a simple boiling procedure in water and alcohol, the sugarcane waste was carbonized to be converted into microporous carbon (MC), which was then further coated with Fe1−xS nanoparticles through a novel and facile sulfurization method. When applied as LIB anode materials, the hierarchical Fe1−xS-microporous carbon (Fe1−xS-MC) nanocomposites thus obtained displayed superior electrochemical performance with ultrahigh specific capacities and excellent cycling stability (1185 mA g−1 after 200 cycles), representing the best electrochemical performance among all the iron sulfide-based anode materials reported to date. The success in converting disposable sugarcane into advanced carbon-based materials opens a new route to substitute graphite as electrode materials, unveiling the great potential values of bio-wastes for practical applications.
Experimental
Synthesis of Fe1−xS-MC nanocomposites
A schematic illustration of the synthesis process of the Fe1−xS-MC nanocomposites is shown in Fig. 1. Sugarcane trunks disposed of from a juice extractor machine were collected from a fruit store in Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong. The sugarcane trunks were cut into pieces and boiled in de-ionized (DI) water and ethanol for 6 h, to remove the sugar contents. During each cooking process, the solution was once replaced with a fresh solution. After being dried in an oven at 90 °C, the sample was carbonized at 1000 °C in Ar with a flow rate of 30 sccm for 4 h, and allowed to cool naturally. Microporous carbon (MC) was then obtained. For surface functionalization, the MC was treated in a mixture of H2SO4 (98%) and HNO3 (70%) (3:1 by volume) under constant stirring at 110 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was then filtered and the precipitate was washed with DI water several times.

An aqueous suspension of MC was produced by ultrasonicating 20 mg MC in DI water for 10 min. In a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, ∼40 ml of the suspension and 0.8 g ferric citrate (FeC6H5O7) were added. The sealed Teflon-lined autoclave was kept in an oven at 200 °C for 18 h and then cooled down to room temperature naturally. The as-synthesized black precipitate was centrifugally washed with DI water and alcohol several times, dried at 100 °C, and used as the precursor of our final product. The precursor was then mixed with sulfur powder and subsequently thermally treated under the protection of Ar flow (flow rate: 30 sccm) to generate the final product of Fe1−xS-MC. The temperature was first raised at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 to 149 °C, held at 149 °C for 3 h, further raised at 10 °C min−1 to 800 °C, and held at 800 °C for 5 h.
Sample characterization
The morphology, crystalline structure and composition of the samples were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Philips XL-30 FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, AMETEX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, CM 20 FEG operated with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG ESCALAB 220i-XL surface analysis system equipped with a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source at 1486.6 eV). The crystallography was examined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Philips X'Pert MRD with Cu-Kα radiation). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a TGA Q50 instrument in air with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from ambient temperature to 800 °C to determine the percentage of Fe1−xS in the composites. Raman spectral analyses were performed with a Renishaw visual Raman microscope using a 514 nm laser beam with a spectral resolution of 1 cm−1 and spatial resolution of approximately 1 mm. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was measured using a Quantachrome surface area analyzer (NOVA 1200).
Electrochemical performance evaluation
The electrochemical performance of Fe1−xS-MC was evaluated using LIR2032 coin-type half-cells assembled in an argon-filled glove box (MBraun Lab Master 130). The working electrodes were prepared by mixing the active materials (Fe1−xS-MC, or Fe1−xS), carbon black (Super-P) and sodium alginate (CMC) with a weight ratio of 80:10:10, and then pasting the mixture into a slurry 200 μm thick on copper foil (99.6%), using a plastic blade. Pure Li foil was used as the counter electrode and a Celgard 2400 microporous polypropylene membrane was utilized as the separator. A solution of LiPF6 (1.0 mol L−1) in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1:1, by volume) was applied as the electrolyte. The electrochemical performance of rating and cycling was tested in the voltage range of 0.01–3.00 V vs. Li/Li+ at room temperature. The cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (CHI, 600D) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the range of 0.01–3.00 V. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were collected after a 2 h rest by providing an ac voltage of 5 mV amplitude over a frequency range from 100 kHz to 10 mHz within an electrochemistry workstation (Zahner Cimps).
Results and discussion
The SEM study (Fig. 2a–d) of the MC sample collected after the carbonization treatment reveals that a microporous structure was formed featuring bamboo-like interconnected 3D porous networks with periodic structural features. Further magnified SEM images (Fig. 2b) show that the pore diameter was ∼2–5 μm. The walls of the microporous carbon were observed to be very thin (Fig. S1†) with sharp edges, suggesting their good mechanical flexibility. A low-magnification SEM image of the microporous carbon (Fig. 2d) shows an array of self-aligned micro-bamboo tubes. Interestingly, the Fe1−xS-MC composites possessed an interesting morphology with the self-aligned micro-bamboo tubes decorated with nanoparticles (Fig. 2d and e) which were found to be Fe1−xS nanoparticles from the TEM examination (Fig. 3). A zoomed-in view (Fig. 2e) reveals the regular shape of the Fe1−xS nanoparticles, and they were fairly thickly dotted and tightly anchored onto the microporous carbon walls. The specific surface areas of MC and Fe1−xS-MC were evaluated to be 110.8 m2 g−1 and 56.7 m2 g−1, respectively (Fig. S2†). To examine the spatial distribution of the Fe1−xS nanoparticles, EDS elemental mapping was performed (Fig. S3†). The C (red), Fe (yellow) and S (blue) elements were found to be evenly distributed over the entire measured region, indicating a uniform distribution of the Fe1−xS nanoparticles. TGA measurements were further carried out to check the percentage of Fe1−xS in the composites as shown in Fig. S4.† From 300 °C to 650 °C, Fe1−xS was oxidized to Fe2O3 slowly, while MC was burned to form CO2. Thus, this validates that Fe1−xS accounts for 64 wt% of the Fe1−xS-MC nanocomposites.

A Raman spectrum collected from the MC sample (Fig. 2g) displayed two strong peaks at 1585 and 1346 cm−1. The G band at 1585 cm−1 can be assigned to the characteristic doubly degenerate E2g mode of graphite, resulting from the emission of zone-central optical phonons.18–20 The explicit D band at 1346 cm−1 is possibly associated with the defects in graphite referring to the modes coming approximately from the K point of graphite.21,22 More specifically, the D peak is possibly due to the LO phonons around the K point,23 which are activated by double resonance processes,24,25 and are strongly dispersive, with excitation energy due to the Kohn Anomaly at K.25–27 The intensity of the G band is a bit higher than the D band (ID/IG ≈ 0.97), suggesting that the graphitization of the as-synthesized MC sample is higher than the commercially used carbon fiber paper, carbon cloth or even carbon nanotubes reported previously in the literature.28–30 Furthermore, a very broad peak centered at ∼2700 cm−1 was observed, indicating that the walls in the MC composite consist of stacked carbon multilayers, similar to the previously reported 3D foothill-like graphene scaffold.31
The XRD patterns of the MC sample (Fig. S5†) exhibited two well-defined broad diffraction peaks which are assigned to the (002) and (100) planes of hexagonal carbon (JCPDS Card no. 41-1487). The broad width of these two peaks indicates that the grain size of the graphite is quite small,10,32 even though the MC sample was obtained using a high temperature treatment at up to 1000 °C. Further XRD studies of the as-synthesized hydrothermal product, Fe1−xS and Fe1−xS-MC (Fig. 2h) revealed that an Fe-containing middle product was created after the hydrothermal reaction, which is denoted as the “as-synthesized HT product”. The morphology of the as-synthesized HT product is shown in Fig. S6a.† It can be clearly seen that nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the MC surface. However, no diffraction peak can be clearly identified from the XRD pattern of the as-synthesized HT product, implying the possibility that the as-synthesized HT product is amorphous. After further sulfurization treatment, the final product of Fe1−xS-MC was achieved. Strong peaks at 29.9°, 33.8°, 43.7° and 53.1° were observed (Fig. 2h) which can be indexed to the (200), (205), (2010) and (220) planes of the pyrrhotite-5T Fe1−xS (JCPDS Card no. 29-0724), respectively. Note that due to the strong peak intensity of Fe1−xS, there are no obvious peaks from the microporous carbon. For comparison, pure Fe1−xS was also synthesized following the same procedure without adding microporous carbon during the reaction process. The XRD pattern of Fe1−xS (Fig. 2h, blue curve) displayed the same peaks as Fe1−xS-MC, suggesting that the obtained Fe1−xS was also pyrrhotite-5T Fe1−xS. The SEM study (Fig. S6b†) reveals that the as-synthesized Fe1−xS particles agglomerated together forming clusters of irregular shapes.
The TEM examination (Fig. 3a) confirms the presence of thin carbon sheets in the microporous carbon, consistent with the SEM observation (Fig. S1†). A typical TEM image of the Fe1−xS-MC composite is depicted in Fig. 3b, which shows numerous nanoparticles assembled on the microporous carbon sheet. Although the sample had been ultrasonically treated for a long time during the TEM sample preparation process, the Fe1−xS particles remained attached, suggesting strong bonding between the Fe1−xS particles and the microporous carbon scaffold. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern measured for the Fe1−xS particles (inset of Fig. 3b) revealed their polycrystalline nature. The diffraction rings from center to outside could be assigned to the (220), (2010), (205) and (200) planes, which was in good agreement with the XRD findings. A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of an Fe1−xS nanoparticle grown on the microporous carbon sheet (Fig. 3c) displayed well-resolved periodic lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.29 nm, corresponding to the (220) planes in pyrrhotite-5T Fe1−xS. For comparison, the pure Fe1−xS agglomerates were dispersed using intense ultrasonic treatment for a long time and then studied under the TEM (Fig. 3d), where irregular Fe1−xS clusters were observed. Their SAED pattern (inset of Fig. 3d) showed exactly the same diffraction rings as the Fe1−xS nanoparticle in the Fe1−xS-MC sample, verifying again that the Fe1−xS nanoparticles in Fe1−xS-MC are of the same phase as pure Fe1−xS, in spite of their different morphologies.
XPS was employed to analyze the valence states of Fe1−xS-MC. The survey spectrum (Fig. 4a) shows signals from iron, oxygen, carbon and indium (from the sample holder). The oxygen signal was ascribed to the attached epoxy groups (C–O), carbonyl groups (CO) and carboxyl groups (COOH), which were identified in the C 1s spectrum (Fig. 4b) at 286.4 eV, 288.4 eV and 288.9 eV, respectively.33,34 It should be pointed out that the as-carbonized microporous carbon was highly hydrophobic, so it needed to be surface modified with polar functional groups so that the ionic nanoparticles could be successfully grown on it. That is why the as-carbonized microporous carbon was treated with H2SO4/HNO3 to produce the desired oxygen-containing surface functional groups whose presence was indicated by the C 1s spectrum (Fig. 4b). The microporous carbon was found to maintain the same morphology after the acid treatment (Fig. S7a and b†). The S 2p XPS spectrum of Fe1−xS-MC exhibits two peaks at 163.2 and 168.7 eV, corresponding to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, which are characteristic features of Fe1−xS. The Fe 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 4d) shows two peaks at 711.4 and 724.8 eV, attributable to Fe 2p2/3 and Fe 2p1/2, in good agreement with the Fe1−xS phase.

To examine its capability in lithium storage, the acid-treated MC was assembled into a coin-type half-cell, in which Li metal foils were used as the counter electrode. The galvanostatic discharge/charge test was carried out at a current density of 0.33C (1C = 372 mA g−1) between 0 and 3 V vs. Li+/Li. The discharge/charge voltage profile for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 20th, 50th, 60th cycles are disclosed in Fig. 5a. Different from the long plateau after 0.5 V observed for graphite in the literature,35 the first discharge profile of MC presents a short voltage plateau at ∼1.45 V, and then a long slope starting at ∼1 V, which is similar to the voltage profile behavior of functionalized graphene nanoribbons previously reported,34 suggesting that more than one lithium storage mechanism was involved. The MC delivers a specific discharge capacity of 552 mA h g−1 and a specific charge capacity of 324 mA h g−1 in these initial processes. The irreversible capacity of 228 mA h g−1 could be caused by the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer on the surface of MC.36 Because Li+ is quite active in the first cycle which induces electrode instability, only 80–90% lithium was recovered in the first extraction process.35 Furthermore, an SEI layer may be formed during the first cycle due to the electrolyte decomposition that passivates the electrode, by allowing only the transportation of ions (e.g., Li+) but not electrons.37,38 After the first cycle, the charging curves of the 2nd, 3rd and 20th cycles well overlapped with each other, whereas the 60th cycle delivered an increased charging capacity. A further long-term cycling test (Fig. 5b) shows that the discharge capacity of MC did not show any decline beyond the second cycle (300 mA h g−1) and reached 311 mA h g−1 after 120 cycles. Excellent Coulombic efficiency was also observed for MC after the first 5 cycles (efficiency of 58.5% for the 1st cycle) with an average value of over 99.4%. These observations on MC represent a very attractive LIB performance among the carbon materials reported to date, cf., the initial values of hard carbon anodes are usually below 55% due to the formation of a thick SEI layer.39 Notably, the specific capability (311 mA h g−1) delivered by MC at 0.33C is much higher than that of commercial graphite (normally at 150–200 mA h g−1 at 0.33C).40 Previous research has pointed out that the major drawback of using graphite as LIB anode materials is its low theoretical capacity of 372 mA h g−1, calculated assuming that the LiC6 compound is formed for lithium storage.35 For MC studied here, the observed high lithium storage capability is possibly due to other lithium storage mechanisms, e.g., surface Li storage.41 Researchers have proposed that the formation of lithium multilayers on a carbon surface is an intermediate state between lithium intercalation and reduction to metallic lithium, which can be imaged as lithium plating onto the carbon surface at the electrode potential close to that of elemental lithium, resulting in additional lithium ions being converted into metallic lithium.41,42

For comparison, the cycling performance of the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) from the literature43 under the same current density is shown in Fig. 5(b), which shows nearly the same specific capacity (316 mA h g−1 at the 50th cycle). In spite of the encouraging battery performance achieved, the energy density of the sugarcane waste-derived MC is still far from meeting the ever-increasing demand in the mobile electronics industry and for large-scale applications. In order to boost the energy density, different strategies can be implemented, such as integration with functional metal oxides (Fe3O4, CuO2, TiO2, SnO2, etc.),43–46 doping with active elements (B, N and S),47–49 and tailoring the surface functional groups.34 Herein, we utilize a novel sulfurization method to grow pyrrhotite-5T Fe1−xS nanoparticles on MC to boost its energy density. Our interest in the Fe1−xS modification strategy is based on the fact that sulfides possess high theoretical capacities, and are non-toxic and cost effective.50,51 Nonetheless, sulfide suffers a large volume change upon lithium uptake and release, and the formation of the insulating polysulfide Li2Sx (1 < x < 8)52 which is soluble in the liquid electrolyte and can gradually migrate to the cathode, causing severe loss of the active materials and poor cycling stability. Furthermore, the dissolved polysulfides can also deteriorate the conductivity of the electrolyte by forming an insulating layer outside the electrode, leading to capacity degradation.53,54 Recently, it was found that reducing the particle size of sulfides or wrapping them with a thin carbon layer could be an effective strategy in alleviating the dissolution problem of polysulfide.51,55,56 Here, a novel type of nanocomposite comprising iron sulfide nanoparticles and 3D MC is very promising for achieving high-performance LIBs.
The cycling performance of the Fe1−xS-MC nanocomposite was tested at a current density of 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 6a). Unlike the decay behaviors commonly observed for FeS-related electrodes in previous studies,57 Fe1−xS-MC delivers a stable capability in the first 100 cycles, which keeps increasing in the following cycles. In the first cycle, Fe1−xS-MC delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1094 mA h g−1 and a charge capacity of 787 mA h g−1, leading to a Coulombic efficiency of 72%. This great discharging/charging capacity is much higher than the theoretical value (609 mA h g−1 for FeS) and is possibly due to the formation of the specific SEI layer upon decomposition of the electrolyte solvent.43,58,59 Note that extra high capacity has been widely observed in transition metal oxide electrodes, which has been suggested to be due to the formation of a gel-like organic layer on the surface of the porous architectures.55,60 In the second cycle, Fe1−xS-MC delivers a discharge capacity of 788 mA h g−1 and charge capacity of 745 mA h g−1, showing a quickly increased Coulombic efficiency to 94%. After 200 cycles, the capacity gradually increases to 1185 mA h g−1, which is more than 3 times that of commercially used graphite (372 mA h g−1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest value among the iron sulfide-based materials reported to date (Fig. 7 and Table S1†).50,51,57,61–65 The SEM image of Fe1−xS-MC nanocomposites after cycling at 100 mA g−1 for ∼200 cycles (Fig. S8†) reveals a varied morphology due to the formation of an SEI layer on the surface. However, remarkably, the Fe1−xS particles were still decorated on MC even after extended cycling with Li+ uptake and release, indicating the helpful role of MC in preserving the sulfide materials during cycling.

 Fig. 7  Cycling performance comparison with the previously reported iron sulfide-based LIB anodes tested at constant current densities. 
For comparison, the cycling performance of pure Fe1−xS electrodes was tested at 100 mA g−1, which showed poor cyclability (Fig. 6a). Although the initial discharge capacity (1219 mA h g−1) was higher than that of Fe1−xS-MC, it kept decreasing in the first 20 cycles, and quickly dropped to 235 mA h g−1 after 60 cycles. The poor cycling stability of the pure Fe1−xS particles is possibly due to the formation of undesirable polysulfide from Fe1−xS, the volume expansion of the sulfide, and the aggregation of the nanoparticles during the continuous Li+ uptake and release process. This result confirms the important role of MC, which helps alleviate the sulfide aggregation, prevent polysulfide dissolution, and increase the conductivity of the whole composite.

Fig. 6b shows the charging/discharging voltage profiles of the Fe1−xS-MC nanocomposite electrode for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 20th, 50th and 100th cycles, at a current density of 100 mA g−1 in the voltage range of 0 to 3 V vs. Li+/Li. In the first discharge process, a large plateau at ∼1.3 V was seen, which is assigned to the reaction between Fe1−xS and lithium with the formation of Fe, Li2S and Li-rich phases.52,66 A slope between 0.8 and 0.2 V was observed, which is attributed to the formation of the SEI layer and Li2FeS2 (eqn (1)).51,61 Fe1−xS + 2Li + 2e− → Li2FeS2 + Fe(1)
Note that the conversion between Li2−xFeS2 and Li2FeS2 is reversible, allowing iron sulfides to be applied to rechargeable LIBs. In the charging process, an obvious voltage plateau was observed between 1.8 and 1.9 V (Fig. 6b), which is attributed to the oxidation process of Fe to Li2FeS2.61 From the 2nd to 20th cycle, nearly the same lithiation/delithiation profiles were observed, presenting stable cycling performance. It was noticed that the 50th cycle delivered a higher discharge capacity than the previous cycles, and even higher capacities were delivered after the 100th cycle, consistent with the cycling performance shown in Fig. 6a.
In order to evaluate their capability for high power density LIBs, the Fe1−xS-MC nanocomposites were galvanostatically tested at various current densities from 100 mA g−1 to 8000 mA g−1 (Fig. 6c). Excellent rate capability was observed for Fe1−xS-MC: the discharge capacities were 776, 728, 715, 669, 562 and 361 mA h g−1 at 100, 300, 500, 1000, 4000 and 8000 mA g−1, respectively. Remarkably, after sixty cycles with different current densities of up to 8000 mA g−1, a high capacity of 755 mA h g−1 was successfully recovered with the current density shifted back to 100 mA g−1. For comparison, the rate performance of pure Fe1−xS particles delivered discharge capacities of 826, 773, 735, 650, 408 and 232 mA h g−1 at 100, 300, 500, 1000, 4000 and 8000 mA g−1, respectively. It can be seen, that although the Fe1−xS particle electrode delivered higher specific capacities than Fe1−xS-MC at low current densities (100 and 300 mA g−1), it showed significantly lower specific capacities with much worse stability at high current densities (1000, 4000 and 8000 mA g−1). This observation is consistent with the cycling behaviors depicted in Fig. 6a.
The cycling performances of Fe1−xS-MC and pure Fe1−xS at the high current density of 300 mA g−1 were further investigated (Fig. 6d). The capacity of Fe1−xS-MC decreased in the initial 10 cycles and then became stabilized afterwards, delivering a discharge capacity of 941, 662 and 630 mA h g−1 at the 1st, 10th and 40th cycle, respectively. On the other hand, with the capacity measured to be 959, 720 and 333 mA h g−1 at the 1st, 10th and 40th cycle, respectively, pure Fe1−xS delivered a slightly higher capacity than Fe1−xS-MC in the initial 20 cycles, but its performance deteriorated quickly afterwards, in good agreement with the cycling performance at 100 mA g−1 shown in Fig. 6a. The largely improved rate and cycling performance of Fe1−xS-MC is mainly attributed to the synergetic effects of the Fe1−xS nanostructures and the hierarchical MC framework. The well dispersed Fe1−xS nanoparticles are more tolerant to the large volume change associated with the lithium uptake and release process. The strong bonding between the Fe1−xS nanoparticles and the MC substrate may help alleviate the formation of the insulated polysulfide Li2Sx.50 Meanwhile, MC serves as a flexible and robust conductive scaffold that better accommodates the strain induced during the lithiation/delithiation process while maintaining good electrical contact with the Fe1−xS nanoparticles. Furthermore, by evenly dispersing the Fe1−xS nanoparticles on MC, self-aggregation of the Fe1−xS nanoparticles can be effectively restricted during the cycling process, while easy accessibility by the electrolyte is ensured with the active materials present in a 3D open hierarchical architecture with a large work surface area.
To better understand the redox reaction taking place during the Li+ uptake and release process, a cyclic voltammetry (CV) study of Fe1−xS-MC was carried out between 3 and 0 V (Fig. 6e). A sharp reduction peak at ca. 1.03 V was observed in the first cycle, attributed to the following reaction (eqn (2)):50–52 Fe1−xS + 2Li + 2e− → Li2S + Fe(2)
Another broad, discernible reduction peak at 0.4–0.8 V shown in the first cycle was assigned to the formation of the SEI layer,50 which disappeared in the subsequent charge/discharge cycles. A strong anodic peak at 1.95 V was found in the first cycle, which is ascribed to the oxidation of Fe to Li2−xFeS2.62,67 In the later cycles (2nd and 3rd), two reduction peaks appeared at 1.36 and 1.91 V, indicating the formation of Li2−xFeS251,62 and the reversible delithiation process (Li2−xFeS2 to Li2FeS2).50
AC impedance measurements were conducted on Fe1−xS-MC and Fe1−xS to understand their interfacial properties. The Nyquist plots (Fig. 8a) of Fe1−xS-MC and Fe1−xS both show a semicircular loop at high frequency and a sloping straight line at low frequency. The analysis of the equivalent circuit model (Fig. 8b) is given as follows: (a) the ohmic resistance Rs is related to Li+ transport in the electrolyte; (b) the resistance Rf and constant phase element (CPE) 1 correspond to Li+ migration through the surface layers; (c) the resistance Rct and CPE2 are associated with the charge transfer between the electrode/electrolyte interface; (d) the Warburg impedance W is attributed to Li+ diffusion in the active material.68–70Fig. 7a clearly reveals that the Rct values for Fe1−xS-MC and Fe1−xS were ∼50 and 125 Ω, respectively, implying that the improvement in the electronic conductivity of Fe1−xS-MC is due to the combination of Fe1−xS with MC. These results confirm that the 3D hierarchical MC can serve as a highly conductive network for effectively improving electron transport throughout the nanocomposite.

Conclusion
In summary, a scalable method has been introduced for conveniently transforming sugarcane waste into hierarchical microporous carbon (MC) for lithium-ion battery applications. The microporous carbon thus obtained exhibits a comparable storage capability to reduced graphene oxide, far better than the current commercial graphite. To further improve the lithium storage capability, Fe1−xS nanoparticles were deposited on the microporous carbon scaffold robustly, using a novel sulfurization method. The as-prepared hierarchical composite electrode of Fe1−xS-MC delivers excellent cycling stability, good rate retention, and a capacity well beyond the theoretical value. The superior performance of Fe1−xS-MC can be ascribed to the synergetic effects from the high flexibility and high conduction of the MC scaffolds, and the nanosized Fe1−xS. This work demonstrates the great potential for using biological waste as a rich recyclable resource for supplying sustainable and cost-effective solutions to energy challenges.
