    , Accepted 4th June 2019First published on 4th June 2019AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered great attention from the scientific community due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved via low-cost and solution-processed fabrication techniques. However, their low stability has hindered their commercialization. Replacing hole transport materials (HTMs) and Au electrodes with carbon electrodes is a promising way to address the stability issues of PSCs because carbon materials are stable, inert to ion migration, and inherently water-resistant. So far, carbon-based PSCs without HTMs (C-PSCs) have seen much progress and their PCEs have been promoted to above 16%. Herein, we comb through the recent developments in designing, fabricating and optimizing high-performance C-PSCs. First, some key issues peculiar to C-PSCs in terms of the device structure and working principles of C-PSCs, which are different from those of HTM-based PSCs, are stressed. Then, the specific methods and strategies for achieving high-performance C-PSCs are summarized and discussed, which are categorized by the electron transport materials, perovskite layer and carbon electrode. Finally, an outlook is provided, with an aim to point out the promising research directions to further improve device performance and push the technology for commercialization.Haining Chen

1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted keen attention because of the rapid increase in their power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% in 2009 to recent 24.2%.1–19 Such an exceptional performance stems from the particular and advantageous optoelectronic properties of hybrid perovskite materials (ABX3: A = CH3NH3, HC(NH2)2; B = Pb, Sn; X = Cl, Br, I), such as a high absorption coefficient,8,20 high mobility,21–24 long balanced carrier diffusion length22,23,25,26 and low exciton binding energy.27 However, their commercialization is seriously hindered by the low device stability.28–37
For conventional PSCs (e.g. TiO2/perovskite/hole transport materials (HTMs)/metal), the use of an organic HTM and metal electrode is an important cause for the low device stability.28 This is because most of the efficient organic HTMs are operationally unstable and are usually susceptible to migration of halide ions and metal ions (from the metal electrode).28,31,38–43 To solve this problem, replacing the HTM and metal with a carbon electrode is a promising approach because carbon materials are cheap, stable, inert to ion migration, and inherently water-resistant.44–46 Indeed, impressive high stability has been reported for carbon-based PSCs (C-PSCs), making them some of the most promising PSCs for commercialization.16,44,47–55
Although C-PSCs show considerably enhanced stability, their PCEs largely lag behind those of HTM-based PSCs because hole selectivity at the perovskite/carbon interface is low, energy band alignment at the perovskite/carbon interface is far from optimized, and last but not the least, the carbon electrode could not reflect the incident light for multiple-rounds of absorption.28 In 2008, the first reported prototype of C-PSCs achieved a relatively low PCE of 0.37%.19,56,57 After device structure optimization and the utilization of mesoporous carbon in 2013, the PCE was promoted to 6.6%.58 Since then, in order to elevate the PCE, more and more specific methods and strategies have been undertaken to address the above special issues. As a result, much progress has been made in C-PSCs and a PCE of over 16% has been achieved.59,60
Herein, we take a systematic look at the recent developments in high-performance C-PSCs. In this review, we first discuss the distinctive issues of C-PSCs with regard to the device structure and working principles of C-PSCs in some detail, with a side by side comparison with HTM-based PSCs. Then, the specific methods and strategies for designing and fabricating the electron transport material (ETM), the perovskite layer and the carbon electrode will be summarized and evaluated. Finally, an outlook will be given to point out the future research directions to further improve the device performance. Because of the breadth of the area, we are obliged to be selective by focusing on the specific methods and strategies for addressing the special issues faced by C-PSCs. Therefore, many important studies on C-PSCs may be unfortunately omitted here, for which we refer the readers to other relevant review articles. For example, one of our previous reviews has categorized the device structures of C-PSCs and summarized their corresponding progress, while another review has focused on the research progress on the stability and large-scale fabrication of C-PSCs.
2. The peculiar issues of C-PSCs
Conventional HTM-based PSCs consist of a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, TiO2 dense layer, TiO2 mesoporous layer, perovskite, HTM and Au, whose structure is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). After replacing the HTM and Au electrode with a carbon electrode, one obtains a C-PSC (Fig. 1(b)), in which the carbon electrode is in direct contact with the perovskite layer. The energy band diagrams and the working principles of HTM-based PSCs and C-PSCs are illustrated in Fig. 1(c) and (d), respectively. In HTM-based PSCs, the holes generated in the perovskite layer are extracted by the HTM, followed by transfer to the Au electrode, while in C-PSCs, holes are directly extracted by the carbon electrode. According to their device structure and fabrication procedure, C-PSCs were divided into three types in our previous review: meso C-PSCs, embedment C-PSCs and paintable C-PSCs.28

While the photogenerated holes in the perovskite are extracted by the HTM in HTM-based PSCs, they are directly extracted by the carbon electrode in C-PSCs. Consequently, compared with HTM-based PSCs, the Efp in C-PSCs is increased because the Fermi-level of the carbon electrode is commonly lower than the VB level of the HTM. In addition, the C-PSCs are less able to block electrons at the perovskite/C interface. 
Due to the differences in the device structure and working principles between HTM-based PSCs and C-PSCs, some issues arise, which are peculiar to C-PSCs. First, the open-circuit potential (Voc) of a PV device is determined by the difference between the electron quasi-Fermi level (Efn) and hole quasi-Fermi level (Efp). In HTM-based PSCs, Efn is affected by the interaction between the ETM (e.g. TiO2) and the perovskite layer, while Efp is affected by the interaction between the perovskite layer and the HTM. In contrast, in C-PSCs, the Efp should be mainly influenced by the interaction between the perovskite and the carbon electrode. Since the Fermi-level of carbon is commonly higher than the HOMO level of the HTM, the Efp position will thus be higher. As a result, the Voc of C-PSCs is usually reported to be lower than that of HTM-based PSCs (0.8–1.05 V vs. 1–1.2 V). Therefore, in order to achieve high Voc in C-PSCs, it is necessary to lower the Fermi-level of the carbon electrode.
Second, the hole selectivity at the perovskite/carbon interface is significantly lower than that at the perovskite/HTM interface. As shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d), the HOMO level of the HTM is close to the VB level of the perovskite, which favors the hole transfer at the perovskite/HTM interface, whereas the large difference between the Fermi-level of carbon and the VB level of the perovskite would slow down the hole transfer. In addition, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the HTM is higher than the CB level of the perovskite, which would suppress electron back transfer from the perovskite to metal electrode. In contrast, electron back transfer to the carbon electrode should be serious in C-PSCs. In brief, the charge separation rate is lower at the perovskite/carbon interface than that at the perovskite/HTM interface, which would not only result in higher charge recombination but also lead to severe charge accumulation for larger J–V hysteresis. In order to enhance charge separation in C-PSCs, the ETM layer is usually made porous and thick to enlarge the ETM/perovskite interface area (Fig. 2(a) and (b)).
 Fig. 2  Schematic illustrating the issues peculiar to C-PSCs. The charge separation features at the ETM/perovskite interface based on (a) planar and (b) scaffold substrates. Schematic illustrating light reflecting features at (c) Au and (d) carbon electrodes. Compared with the planar substrate, the mesoporous scaffold could offer a larger contact area at the TiO2/perovskite interface for more efficient charge separation. The smooth Au electrode in HTM-based PSCs could reflect the incident light back to the active layer for multiple round absorption, while the porous black carbon electrode could not. 
Third, the thickness of the whole perovskite layer in C-PSCs is larger than that in HTM-based PSCs for the reason given below. In conventional HTM-based PSCs, although this active layer thickness may not fully absorb the incident light in one round, the mirror-like Au electrode resulting from the smooth HTM layer could effectively reflect the incident light back to the active layer for multiple round absorption (Fig. 2(c) and (d)). Therefore, the thickness of the perovskite layer in HTM-based PSCs can be significantly reduced to about 400–600 nm. For C-PSCs, however, the light reflection capacity of the porous black carbon electrode is very low, meaning that the perovskite layer in C-PSCs should be made thicker, around 1 μm, to afford full light absorption.47,58,61,62
3. ETMs
Since there is no HTM in C-PSCs, the hole selectivity at the perovskite/carbon interface is relatively lower than that at the perovskite/HTM interface. To enhance charge separation, ETMs (mainly TiO2) were usually made porous with a large thickness, which would offer a large interface area for electron injection. To highlight the importance of the mesoporous scaffold in C-PSCs, Chen et al. conducted a comparative study on planar and mesoporous C-PSCs (Fig. 3(a) and (b)).63 After replacing the planar substrate with a mesoporous one, the PCE was significantly promoted from 5.27% to 11.37% (Fig. 3(c)). As shown in their work, a mesoporous scaffold well improved the FF and reduced J–V hysteresis, suggesting considerably enhanced charge transfer and lowered carrier accumulation. In addition to enhancing charge transfer, a mesoporous scaffold could help to support a thicker perovskite layer for increasing light absorption capacity, which is also important for C-PSCs, especially when the solubility of perovskite precursors is low. In brief, a mesoporous scaffold is required for achieving high-performance C-PSCs.

Compared with the planar substrate, the mesoporous scaffold improved the FF and reduced J–V hysteresis due to enhanced charge transfer and lowered carrier accumulation. So far, many different nanostructures have been designed and prepared for C-PSCs. 
For constructing a TiO2 scaffold, TiO2 nanocrystals were commonly used as nano units. The first C-PSCs (meso C-PSCs) reported by the Han group employed a thick TiO2 scaffold (about 1 μm) as the ETM and a PCE of 6.6% was obtained.58 After that, most of the meso C-PSCs were based on such thick TiO2 scaffolds and until now, PCEs of over 15% have been widely reported for meso C-PSCs by several groups.44,47,48,64–69 The device structure of paintable C-PSCs is somehow different from that of meso C-PSCs, in which a perovskite layer is first deposited on a TiO2 scaffold, followed by the deposition of a carbon electrode. Therefore, the optimum structure parameters are also different. Chen et al. and Zhang et al. have separately investigated the effects of the film thickness of the TiO2 scaffold on the performance of paintable C-PSCs.61,62 The optimum thickness was about 500–600 nm, which was smaller than that used in meso C-PSCs but was still significantly larger than that used in HTM-based PSCs (100–200 nm). Similarly, the film thickness of the TiO2 scaffold in embedment C-PSCs is also about 500–600 nm.37,59 So far, both the paintable and embedment C-PSCs based on TiO2 mesoporous scaffolds have achieved PCEs of over 15%.37,59,60,70
In addition to the mesoporous structure, other TiO2 nanostructures have also been prepared and employed in C-PSCs.71–73 TiO2 nanorod arrays (NRs) were for the first time used in C-PSCs by Chen et al., in which rutile TiO2 NRs with a length of several hundred nanometers were directly grown on FTO glass without seeds (Fig. 3(d)).74 In order to passivate the surface states of TiO2 NRs and cover the exposed FTO substrate, a thin anatase layer was further coated by a liquid phase deposition method. The C-PSCs based on such a structure achieved a high Voc of 1.01 V and a PCE of 8.61%. Since the incident light cannot be reflected by a black carbon electrode to allow second-round absorption by the perovskite, light absorption is usually insufficient in C-PSCs, especially in the long wavelength region. To address this issue, Zheng et al. designed a TiO2 nanobowl array to manage light absorption (Fig. 3(e)).75,76 Such a structure significantly enhanced the light absorption, in the long wavelength region, which well elevated the Jsc and PCE. Xiao et al. employed nanoporous submicron TiO2 spheres with an average diameter of around 200 nm to construct an ETM scaffold (Fig. 3(f)).71 Such a scaffold showed enhanced light scattering capacity compared to the nanoparticle counterpart, which well improved the light absorption at the long wavelength region.
Besides TiO2, some other ETMs have been investigated for use in C-PSCs, including ZnO, SnO2, Nb2O5 and C60. As ZnO has a similar band structure to TiO2, planar, mesoporous and NR array ZnO ETMs have also been employed in C-PSCs, all of which achieved a similar PCE of ∼8%.77–79 These PCE values are significantly lower than those achieved by the C-PSCs based on TiO2 ETMs. Though SnO2 is one of the most successful ETMs in planar HTM-based PSCs, very limited examples have been reported for C-PSCs. Lin et al. have reported a low-temperature-processed SnO2 compact layer for C-PSCs, which well afforded a higher built-in potential (0.94 V) than the C-PSCs based on mesoporous TiO2 (0.89 V).80 Compared with the TiO2 device, the SnO2 one achieved an obviously higher Voc (1.07 vs. 0.96 V) and PCE (14.5% vs. 10.46%). Different from the above-mentioned oxide ETMs, Nb2O5 is less-known, but very recently, the application of a planar Nb2O5 substrate in inorganic C-PSCs was successful. The C-PSCs of FTO/Nb2O5/CsPbI2Br/carbon achieved a PCE of over 12%, a record PCE of inorganic C-PSCs.81
C60 and its derivatives have been widely used in inverted HTM-based PSCs, which show considerably higher electron extraction rate and extremely smaller hysteresis.82–87 Meng et al. for the first time employed a C60 compact layer in C-PSCs.70 The C60 compact layer was deposited on an ITO substrate by thermal evaporation (Fig. 4(a)). Compared with the TiO2 compact layer, the perovskite on the C60 compact layer shows a significantly higher PL quenching rate, suggesting a faster charge extraction. The paintable C-PSCs based on such C60 compact layers achieved a considerably higher PCE of 15.38% than those based on TiO2 compact layers (12.06%), with well suppressed hysteresis (Fig. 4(b)). Recently, in order to further improve the electron mobility and electrical conductivity of C60, Zhou et al. doped C60 with hexamethonium bromide (HMB), which not only increased electron mobility and accelerated charge transport, but also reduced trap density.60 Therefore, the PCE of the C-PSCs was further promoted to 16.03% (Fig. 4(c)).

Reproduced with permission.90 Copyright 2019, Wiley. Compared with TiO2, C60 showed significantly enhanced performance in planar C-PSCs. By finely designing composite ETMs, one could improve the band alignment to accelerate charge separation and transport for elevating device performance. 
Designing composite ETMs is a new research direction in PSCs, in which improved band alignment could accelerate charge separation and transport to suppress charge recombination. Jiang et al. employed a SnO2/TiO2 compact/mesoporous scaffold as an ETM in meso C-PSCs.88 The higher CB level of TiO2 suppressed the back transfer of the injected electrons in SnO2 to the perovskite, and the higher electron mobility of SnO2 accelerated charge transport. Zhao et al. introduced a gradient bi-layer zinc tin oxide (ZTO) thin film into the interface of an FTO/TiO2 compact layer (Fig. 4(d)).89 Benefiting from the suitable matching of the cascade level between the perovskite and ETMs, the charge recombination and energy loss were well suppressed. By further tuning the Zn content, the ZTO films with an optimized gradient energy level delivered a high Voc of 1.02 V and a PCE of 15.86% in meso C-PSCs (Fig. 4(e)). As indicated above, a planar C60 layer has achieved significantly higher performance than a planar TiO2 layer, suggesting the higher electron extraction ability of the former. However, it would be interesting to use a porous C60 as an ETM, but no deposition technique has been developed, and a thick C60 layer would absorb more visible light and raise cost. To address these issues, Tian et al. deposited an ultra-thin C60 layer on a TiO2 mesoporous scaffold by the spray coating technique.90 Compared with bare TiO2, such a composite ETM showed considerably enhanced electron extraction and due to the improved band alignment, charge transfer and transport were also improved. As a result, the PCE was well promoted from 13.7% to 15.4% (Fig. 4(f)). These latest successful examples manifest that designing composite ETMs will be a promising strategy to further improve the device PCE.
4. Perovskite layers
As alluded above, a porous scaffold with a large thickness is needed for constructing high-performance C-PSCs, which helps to enhance charge separation. However, the relatively thick porous scaffold makes the penetration of precursor solution difficult. Therefore, growing a high-quality perovskite layer with high pore filling in the thick scaffold is much more difficult than growing on a planar or thin scaffold substrate.91,92 This could essentially limit device performance. Until now, two general methods have been widely used for perovskite deposition: one-step and two-step deposition methods. Commonly, in the one-step method, the perovskite precursor solution is directly spin-coated on a substrate,2,58 whereas in the two-step method, a PbI2 layer is first deposited on a scaffold and then chemically converted to perovskite in a MAI solution.6,84
In the initial work on meso C-PSCs, a perovskite solution in GBL was applied to a multi-layer mesoporous structure via a one-step deposition method, which resulted in a low PCE of 6.6% (ref. 58) (Fig. 5(a)). The low performance was attributed to the poor solution penetration in the scaffold. To enhance solution penetration, Xu et al. used an ordered porous carbon material as the carbon electrode, which partially improved the solution penetration and slightly increased the PCE to 7%.93 By introducing HOOC(CH2)4NH3I (5-AVAI) into the precursor solution to partially replace MAI, a mixed perovskite of (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 was obtained.47 The crystals of this mixed perovskite appeared to grow in a different feature in the scaffold compared with the pure MAPbI3, which significantly improved pore filling capacity and successfully increased the PCE to 12.8% (Fig. 5(b) and (c)). By combining high-resolution photoluminescence, electroluminescence, Raman, and photocurrent mapping and SEM measurements, Lakhiani et al. found that without 5-AVAI, only ∼4% of the cell area was fully infiltrated, while ∼98% of the cell area was effective in delivering photocurrent after 5-AVAI addition (Fig. 5(d)–(g)).92 Very recently, it was reported that by introducing LiCl into a MAPbI3 solution, the growth rate of perovskite crystals was hindered, which improved the pore filling and coverage in a multi-layer scaffold.94 In addition, this new perovskite layer exhibited much lower defect density and superior conductivity for faster electron transport. As a result, the PCE was greatly increased to 14.5%.

Reproduced with permission.92 Copyright 2019, Wiley. The addition of 5-AVAI in the perovskite solution well improved the pore filling of the perovskite layer in the multi-layer mesoporous scaffold. 
Since the wettability of precursor solutions and the crystallization of the perovskite are largely determined by solvent properties, it is important to explore suitable solvent engineering routes to improve the perovskite pore filling capacity and crystal quality. For example, a mixed DMF/DSMO solvent with good wettability and suitable coordination ability has been shown to improve the infiltration of perovskite and the Pb-I precursor into the multi-layer scaffolds of meso C-PSCs and into the thick TiO2 scaffolds of paintable C-PSCs, both resulting in significantly enhanced photovoltaic performance. Chen et al. conducted a systematic study on the effects of the polarity and viscosity of perovskite precursor solvents on perovskite infiltration in multi-layer mesoporous electrodes.95 Among various solvents, DMF/DMSO solvent was found to improve the perovskite infiltration and crystal quality in the multi-layer mesoporous scaffolds due to its good wettability and suitable coordination ability, ultimately leading to a maximum PCE of 13.89%.95
For paintable C-PSCs, the perovskite layer was usually pre-deposited, followed by the deposition of the carbon electrode. Therefore, the contact at the perovskite/carbon interface was not very good.62,96,97 To enhance the contact, the perovskite should be made smooth. Chen et al. modified the conventional two-step deposition method to achieve a high-quality perovskite layer with better smoothness.62 Due to the moderate polarity of IPA, a dissolution–recrystallization process commonly occurred during the chemical conversion, in which the Ostwald ripening effect would form large and sparsely distributed perovskite crystals and the surface would be roughened. By adding non-polar cyclohexane (CYHEX) into the MAI IPA solution, solvent polarity was reduced, which considerably suppressed the dissolution–recrystallization process and avoided the Ostwald ripening effect (Fig. 6(a)). As a result, a high-quality and even perovskite layer was obtained, which afforded enhanced interfacial contact with the carbon electrode for accelerating charge transfer (Fig. 6(b)). A PCE of 14.38% was achieved for a small area device and a PCE close to 10% for a large area device (1 cm2). By using an ultra-even colloidal layer as the precursor, the PCE was further promoted to 14.50%.98 Besides MAPbI3, an even MAPbBr3 layer with conformable oriented crystallization was also prepared by such a solvent engineering strategy (Fig. 6(c) and (d)), which afforded MAPbBr3 C-PSCs with a PCE of 8.09% and a Voc of 1.35 V.99

The mixed solvent could considerably suppress the dissolution–recrystallization process and avoid the Ostwald ripening effect, leading to a smooth perovskite layer. 
Similar to the investigations on HTM-based PSCs, compositional, anti-solvent and additive engineering have been widely employed to improve the performance of C-PSCs. For example, FAxMA1−xPbI3,100 Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3,101 and CsxFA1−xPbBrxI3−x (ref. 102) perovskites have been used as absorbers to enhance light absorption. Diethyl ether has been employed as an anti-solvent.103 NH4Cl,104 SrCl2,105 guanidinium chloride,106 MABF4,107 polyoxometalate molecules108 and 4-(aminomethyl) benzoic acid hydroiodide109 have been incorporated into the precursor solution as an additive to manipulate the crystal growth to improve the perovskite quality. The effects of these engineering strategies on C-PSCs were similar to those on HTM-based C-PSCs, such as broadening light absorption, increasing grain size, reducing bulk defects and passivating surface traps. Therefore, in this review, we will not discuss these studies in more detail.
5. Carbon electrodes
Many carbon materials have been employed to prepare carbon electrodes. Pure carbon black was first employed in C-PSCs by Wei et al.110 The carbon black was directly collected from a candle flame, also called candle soot, which was composed of carbon nanoparticles and was highly porous. After being deposited on FTO glass, the carbon electrode was directly clamped on a pre-deposited perovskite layer to obtain C-PSCs. Due to the low conductivity of candle soot, the C-PSCs only achieved a low PCE of 2.6%. By changing candle soot to commercial carbon black, the conductivity of carbon electrodes was greatly improved. Furthermore, by employing the embedment device structure, the PCE of C-PSCs was boosted to 11.0%. Due to its small size, carbon black was used to prepare carbon ink (MAI and carbon black in IPA) and the inkjet printing technique was employed to deposit the carbon electrode.111 As carbon ink was deposited on a PbI2 precursor layer, MAI in the ink reacted with PbI2 to in situ generate a perovskite, which immobilized and embedded the carbon black to form a carbon electrode. Since the carbon electrode was embedded in the perovskite layer, the contact at the perovskite/carbon interface was enhanced, which accelerated charge transfer and reduced recombination. As a result, a PCE of 11.6% was obtained. More importantly, inkjet printing held the promise for precise deposition and large-scale production. Though decent PV performance has been obtained using pure carbon black, no further improvement in PCEs has been reported. This is because nanosized carbon units could not form a strong structure and there are a large number of boundaries, which would lower the mechanical and electronic properties of carbon electrodes (Fig. 7(a)).

Among different pure carbon electrodes, the carbon nanotube electrode is the most promising one for enhancing connectivity and hole extraction. The composite carbon electrodes containing graphite and carbon black have been widely used in high-performance C-PSCs. 
To solve the problems faced by carbon black, Wei et al. have employed graphite and carbon nanotubes to prepare carbon electrodes for C-PSCs.112 Though 2D graphite could enhance connectivity in carbon electrodes, its diameter, about tens of micrometers, was too large to afford intimate contact with perovskites (Fig. 7(b)). As a result, the C-PSCs based on a pure graphite electrode achieved a lower PCE than those based on carbon black electrodes. Compared with graphite, carbon nanotubes had a significantly smaller size (tens of nanometers in diameter) and were highly flexible, so they could form strong connectivity with each other and with the perovskite layer (Fig. 7(c)). Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of carbon nanotubes was extremely high. Consequently, the FF and PCE of C-PSCs were promoted to 0.80 and 12.7%, respectively, with a suppressed J–V hysteresis (Fig. 7(d)–(f)). The promising results achieved by carbon nanotubes in C-PSCs aroused great interest and consequently, many studies on various carbon nanotube electrodes have been reported.113–118 So far, a PCE of over 16% has been reported for a carbon nanotube-based device.59 In addition to the above-mentioned examples, various other kinds of carbon materials have been investigated, including graphene,119–121 mesoporous carbon93 and spongy carbon.122 However, not very promising performance has been reported.
Compared with an electrode consisting of a single kind of carbon material, composite carbon electrodes constructed with two or more kinds of carbon materials could combine the advantages of different carbon materials to improve the performance of C-PSCs. The first C-PSCs developed by Han et al. employed carbon black and graphite as composite carbon electrodes.58 For depositing the carbon electrode, carbon paste was first prepared, which was composed of carbon black, graphite, ZrO2 particles and surfactants.123 After screen printing and annealing at 400 °C, a porous carbon electrode was formed. The first C-PSCs based on such a composite carbon electrode achieved a PCE of 6.6%,58 which so far has been promoted to 15.9%.105 As a high-temperature process was needed, such composite carbon electrodes could not be applied in flexible devices. To avoid the high-temperature process, a polymer adhesive could be incorporated into the carbon paste to connect carbon black and graphite at low temperature (Fig. 7(g) and (h)), which could be deposited on flexible substrates (Fig. 7(i)).46,96,124 Such a carbon electrode could be directly deposited on a perovskite layer to produce C-PSCs. More advantageously, various commercial low-temperature carbon pastes have been proved to be effective in C-PSCs.45,61,62,125–128 As the perovskite layer and carbon electrode were separately deposited, many processing parameters of the perovskite layer could be adjusted to improve the film quality, and the processing parameters used in conventional HTM-based PSCs might also be employed to prepare perovskite layers for C-PSCs. Until now, the highest PCE of such C-PSCs has reached 16.03% (ref. 60) and PCEs of over 14% have been widely obtained using various commercial carbon pastes.62,70,98,129
Besides the structure, composition and conductivity of the carbon electrode, the matching degree between the Fermi-level (or work function, WF) of the carbon electrode and the VB level of the perovskite greatly determines the hole extraction rate and hence the performance of C-PSCs.28 It is important to develop carbon materials with suitable Fermi-levels to enhance hole extraction. By manipulating the layer number of graphene, Yan et al. effectively controlled the Fermi-level of a graphene electrode, and the multilayer graphene showed a lower Fermi-level than single-layer graphene, which facilitated the formation of a Schottky junction at the perovskite/graphene interface for enhancing hole extraction and blocking electron back transfer (Fig. 8(a) and (b)).119 As a result, the device based on MG achieved a PCE of 11.5%, obviously higher than that based on SG (6.7%). As is well known, element doping is an effective strategy to adjust the Fermi-level of carbon materials. In order to lower the Fermi level of carbon nanotubes to approach the VB level of perovskites, Zheng et al. doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes with the B element to lower the Fermi level from −4.46 eV to −4.55 eV, which increased the matching degree of the energy levels at the perovskite/carbon interface (Fig. 8(c)).37 As a result, hole extraction was significantly enhanced and the PCE of C-PSCs was boosted from 10.70% to 15.23%. Soon after, Duan et al. doped graphite with the B element to lower the Fermi level of the carbon electrode from −4.81 eV to −5.10 eV, which also enhanced hole extraction and increased device performance.130 A B/P co-doping strategy was further developed by Chen et al., which further lowered the Fermi level from −5.01 eV to −5.12 eV.131 In addition to element doping, Tian et al. applied an oxygen management strategy to increase the oxygen content in carbon black.69 The oxygen-rich carbon black well lowered the Fermi level of carbon electrodes from −5.0 eV to −5.2 eV (Fig. 8(d)). The improved energy level alignment at the perovskite/carbon interface significantly enhanced hole extraction and promoted the Voc from 0.88 V to 0.98 V, which largely elevated the PCE from 13.6% to 15.7%.

6. Interface engineering
The interfaces (TiO2/perovskite and perovskite/carbon interfaces) in C-PSCs largely affect the charge transfer and recombination behavior. Interface engineering may enhance interfacial contact, reduce defect density and adjust the energy level alignment, which would help to suppress the recombination loss and accelerate the charge transfer.
With regard to the TiO2/perovskite interface, a self-assembled silane monolayer was used by Liu et al. to modify the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface in meso C-PSCs (Fig. 9(a)).132 By forming Ti–Si bonds and attaching ammonium species to the periphery of the octahedra in MAPbI3, TiO2 and MAPbI3 were cross-linked to enhance the interfacial contact. Furthermore, the molecular dipole optimized the interfacial energy band alignments, which enhanced the driving force for electron injection. As a result, the PCE was significantly elevated from 9.6% to 12.7% (Fig. 9(b)). Yang et al. in situ grew an ultrathin ferroelectric PbTiO3 layer on a TiO2 scaffold for C-PSCs (Fig. 9(c)). The PbTiO3 has a similar Eg to TiO2 (3.25 eV vs. 3.22 eV).59 However, the CB level of PbTiO3 was considerably higher than that of TiO2 (−3.47 eV vs. −4.06 eV). Such an energy level alignment could suppress the back transfer of the injected electrons in TiO2 to the perovskite (recombination loss), while the electrons in the perovskite could tunnel through the ultrathin PbTiO3 layer to TiO2. More interestingly, the ferroelectric polarization field (EP) of PbTiO3 could help to enhance the built-in field, which accelerated charge transfer and reduced non-radiative recombination processes (Fig. 9(c)). Consequently, the PCE of the embedment C-PSCs was promoted from 13.81% to 16.37% (Fig. 9(d)), the latest record efficiency of C-PSCs.

Interface engineering at the perovskite/carbon interface could enhance interfacial contact, improve connectivity and construct a recombination barrier, which helped to accelerate charge separation and reduce recombination loss. 
Regarding the perovskite/carbon interface, in order to enhance the interfacial contact, Yu et al. designed a new carbon paste that contained a small amount of MAI.133 By using such carbon paste to modify the interface between the MAPbI3 layer and a traditional carbon layer, the MAI molecules could diffuse and react with the pre-formed MAPbI3 layer during thermal stress to afford intimate interfacial contact, which well accelerated charge transport and hence promoted the PCE from 11.3% to 13.6%. A similar strategy has been used by Mali et al. and the device of FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3–xClx/carbon + MAI/carbon achieved a PCE of 13.87% for a small active area and 13.04% for a large active area (∼1.1 cm2).134 Introducing additives into the anti-solvent has been widely employed to improve the performance of HTM-based PSCs. Such a strategy has also been used in paintable C-PSCs by Ryu et al. to improve the interfacial contact in C-PSCs.135 Instead of molecular additives, carbon nanotubes were introduced into an anti-solvent, and were partially embedded into the upper layer of the perovskite film and the exposed parts were implanted into the carbon electrode (Fig. 10(a) and (b)). The carbon nanotubes acted as an additional pathway to enhance hole transfer and hence improved the performance of paintable C-PSCs. Similarly, Wang et al. also bridged the perovskite and carbon electrode with carbon nanotubes by using a chlorobenzene solution containing SWCNTs as the anti-solvent, and achieved a remarkably enhanced PCE of 15.73%.136 In addition to enhancing the interfacial contact, Wu et al. introduced a thin layer of PEO to modify the perovskite/carbon interface to modulate the energy level alignment at the perovskite/carbon interface, which promoted charge transfer and increased the PCE from 12.2% to 14.9%.137 Liu et al. in situ grew a MAPbIxBr3−x layer on a MAPbI3 layer. The higher CB level of MAPbIxBr3−x than that of MAPbI3 suppressed electron back transfer to the carbon electrode, which well promoted the PCE from 11.3% to 16.2%.138
Recently, 3D/2D bi-layered perovskites have been widely used to produce highly efficient and stable HTM-based PSCs, in which a large organic cation was deposited on a pre-formed 3D perovskite layer to in situ grow a quasi-2D perovskite layer.4,5,139 Such a design well improved the device stability and performance, which was attributed to the reduced trap density and the optimized energy level alignment of the 3D/2D bi-layered structure. In response to this, Lee et al. employed an innovative strategy to post-treat the carbon electrode with phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) solution.129 The PEAI solution could penetrate through the carbon electrode to react with a pre-deposited 3D perovskite to form a 2D perovskite layer at the interface (Fig. 10(c) and (d)). The ultrathin PEA2PbI4 layer not only reduced trap density and improved interfacial contact but also served as a recombination barrier, and as a consequence, the PCE of the paintable C-PSCs was promoted from 11.5% to 15.6%.
7. Conclusion and outlook
Recent progress in the development of methods and strategies for achieving high-performance C-PSCs has been reviewed. We have identified some issues peculiar to C-PSCs: (1) energy band levels are considerably mismatched at the perovskite/carbon interface, (2) hole selectivity at the perovskite/carbon interface is low, and (3) carbon electrodes cannot reflect the incident light for multiple-round absorption. Porous ETMs in C-PSCs have been made much thicker than those in HTM-based PSCs to enlarge the junction area for enhancing charge separation. Many other ETMs have been employed as well, including ZnO, SnO2, Nb2O5, C60 and their composite structures. For the perovskite layer, compositional, solvent and additive engineering have been developed to enhance pore filling in the thick ETM scaffolds and to improve the crystalline quality. Various carbon materials have been used to fabricate carbon electrodes and various element doping strategies have been employed to adjust the Fermi-level of the carbon electrodes to reduce energy band mismatch. Interface engineering at the ETM/perovskite and perovskite/carbon interfaces has been extensively studied to enhance charge separation.
So far, the highest PCE of C-PSCs has reached 16.37% but this value is still significantly lower than that reported for HTM-based PSCs (24.2%). To further promote the PCE, the following directions are suggested to be considered.
(1) To enhance charge separation in C-PSCs, thick ETM scaffolds were usually employed, which results in a lot of grain boundaries. The grain boundaries would lower the electron transport rate, cause electron accumulation and thus lead to a high recombination loss. To avoid it, one can grow single-crystal ETMs and develop core/shell scaffolds to accelerate electron transport and shut off the electron back transfer path to perovskites.
(2) A high-quality perovskite layer perfectly matched with the thick ETM scaffold is required for high-performance C-PSCs. A lot of promising deposition methods have been reported for HTM-based PSCs with a thin or planar ETM layer, but they cannot be directly employed in C-PSCs because the nucleation and growth behaviors of perovskite crystals are different for thick scaffolds. Therefore, more suitable perovskite deposition methods for C-PSCs need to be developed.
(3) The Fermi-level of the commonly used carbon electrodes is significantly higher than the VB level of perovskite materials, which limits the hole transfer rate at the perovskite/carbon interface. B-doping has been used to lower the Fermi level of carbon electrodes. However, the doping effect is still limited and exploiting new strategies is still urgent to considerably lower the Fermi-level of carbon electrodes.

 	Fig. 1  Device structures and working principles of HTM-based PSCs and C-PSCs. Device structures of (a) HTM-based PSCs and (b) C-PSCs. Energy band diagrams and charge kinetic behaviors of (c) HTM-based PSCs and (d) C-PSCs. Efn and Efp represent the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels, respectively, after light illumination. Reproduced with permission.28 Copyright 2017, Wiley. While the photogenerated holes in the perovskite are extracted by the HTM in HTM-based PSCs, they are directly extracted by the carbon electrode in C-PSCs. Consequently, compared with HTM-based PSCs, the Efp in C-PSCs is increased because the Fermi-level of the carbon electrode is commonly lower than the VB level of the HTM. In addition, the C-PSCs are less able to block electrons at the perovskite/C interface.	 

 	Fig. 2  Schematic illustrating the issues peculiar to C-PSCs. The charge separation features at the ETM/perovskite interface based on (a) planar and (b) scaffold substrates. Schematic illustrating light reflecting features at (c) Au and (d) carbon electrodes. Compared with the planar substrate, the mesoporous scaffold could offer a larger contact area at the TiO2/perovskite interface for more efficient charge separation. The smooth Au electrode in HTM-based PSCs could reflect the incident light back to the active layer for multiple round absorption, while the porous black carbon electrode could not.	 

 	Fig. 3  Investigations on the structure of ETMs. Cross-sectional SEM images of the C-PSCs based on (a) planar and (b) mesoporous scaffolds, and (c) J–V curves of the planar and mesoporous C-PSCs. Reproduced with permission.63 Copyright 2019, Elsevier. SEM images of various TiO2 structures: (d) NR arrays, (e) nanobowl arrays and (f) nanoporous submicron spheres. Reproduced with permission.74 Copyright 2014, The Royal Society of Chemistry. Reproduced with permission.76 Copyright 2016, The Royal Society of Chemistry. Reproduced with permission.71 Copyright 2018, American Chemical Society. Compared with the planar substrate, the mesoporous scaffold improved the FF and reduced J–V hysteresis due to enhanced charge transfer and lowered carrier accumulation. So far, many different nanostructures have been designed and prepared for C-PSCs.	 

 	Fig. 4  Other types of ETMs and their composite design. (a) Cross-sectional SEM image of the C-PSCs based on a C60 ETM, (b) J–V curves of the C-PSCs based on C60 and TiO2 planar ETMs, and (c) J–V curves of the C-PSCs based on pristine C60 and HMB-doped C60 ETMs. Reproduced with permission.70 Copyright 2018, Wiley. Reproduced with permission.60 Copyright 2019, The Royal Society of Chemistry. (d) Schematic illustrating the charge transfer in the C-PSCs based on a bi-layer ZTO/meso TiO2 ETM, (e) J–V curves of the C-PSCs based on pristine and bi-layer ZTO/meso TiO2 ETMs, and (f) J–V curves of the C-PSCs based on pristine and C60-coated TiO2 mesoporous ETMs. Reproduced with permission.89 Copyright 2019, American Chemical Society. Reproduced with permission.90 Copyright 2019, Wiley. Compared with TiO2, C60 showed significantly enhanced performance in planar C-PSCs. By finely designing composite ETMs, one could improve the band alignment to accelerate charge separation and transport for elevating device performance.	 

 	Fig. 5  Effect of 5-AVAI in the perovskite solution on pore filling. (a) Fabrication process and device structure, and a typical cross-sectional SEM image of meso C-PSCs. Reproduced with permission.58 Copyright 2013, Nature Publishing Group. TEM images of (b) MAPbI3- and (c) (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3-coated TiO2 mesoporous scaffolds.

Reproduced with permission.47 Copyright 2014, American Association for the Advancement of Science. Schematic illustrating the cross-sectional structures of the C-PSCs based on (f) MAPbI3- and (g) (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3-coated TiO2 mesoporous scaffolds. Reproduced with permission.92 Copyright 2019, Wiley. The addition of 5-AVAI in the perovskite solution well improved the pore filling of the perovskite layer in the multi-layer mesoporous scaffold.	 

 	Fig. 6  Solvent engineering for growing smooth perovskite layers. (a) Schematic illustrating the solvent engineering strategy for growing high-quality perovskite layers. Reproduced with permission.62 Copyright 2016, Wiley. (b) Comparison of the interfacial contact and PV performance between the MAPbI3 layers obtained from IPA and IPA/CYHEX solvents. Reproduced with permission.62 Copyright 2016, Wiley. (c) Schematic illustrating the crystal orientation of the perovskite layers obtained from MABr IPA and IPA/CYHEX solutions and (d) cross-sectional SEM image of the MAPbBr3 layer grown on a TiO2 scaffold from the MABr IPA/CYHEX solution. Reproduced with permission.99 Copyright 2016, The Royal Society of Chemistry. Solvent polarity was reduced by introducing non-polar CYHEX into the MAI or MABr IPA solution. The mixed solvent could considerably suppress the dissolution–recrystallization process and avoid the Ostwald ripening effect, leading to a smooth perovskite layer.	 

 	Fig. 7  Types of carbon electrodes. SEM images of the (a) carbon black, (b) graphite and (c) carbon nanotube electrodes. Reproduced with permission.112 Copyright 2015, The Royal Society of Chemistry. J–V curves of the C-PSCs based on (d) carbon black, (e) graphite and (f) carbon nanotube electrodes.

(g and h) SEM images of a low-temperature composite carbon electrode, and (i) photograph of the low-temperature composite carbon electrode deposited on a flexible substrate. Reproduced with permission.46 Copyright 2014, American Chemical Society. Among different pure carbon electrodes, the carbon nanotube electrode is the most promising one for enhancing connectivity and hole extraction. The composite carbon electrodes containing graphite and carbon black have been widely used in high-performance C-PSCs.
