    , Accepted 26th March 2019First published on 2nd April 2019AbstractThe electron-donating core is one of key components in constructing high-performance nonfullerene acceptors for organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, dithienocyclopentadibenzothiophene (DTCDBT), a C2v-symmetric core, was for the first time used to design and synthesize efficient nonfullerene acceptors (DBTTC, DBTIC and DBTIC-2F) with various bandgaps in combination with different electron-withdrawing terminal units. When the nonfullerene acceptors were used to fabricate OSCs with a wide-bandgap polymer donor (PBDB-T), the DBTTC-based device exhibited an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.25%. While the DBTIC- and DBTIC-2F-based devices showed lower PCEs of 9.66% and 6.81%, respectively. The results afford a useful rational design strategy as well as a new C2v-symmetric building block for nonfullerene acceptors which can be used for further advancing the PCEs of photovoltaic devices.
1. Introduction
With their salient features of light-weight, low-cost, large-area processability and good flexibility, organic solar cells (OSCs) are emerging as an alternative energy-conversion technology to those based on the traditional inorganic solar cells.1–9 For the active layer materials in OSCs, bandgaps and energy levels of both p-type (hole-transporting) and n-type (electron-transporting) materials can be rationally tuned thereby leading to greatly improved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs from less than 1% at the beginning10 to currently more than 13%.11–15
Recently, nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) structured with acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) configurations have been regarded as more promising n-type materials compared to the traditional fullerene-based acceptors.6,7,16 By now, a large number of NFAs have been designed and synthesized by using different side chains, various terminal acceptor units, different aromatic cores with varied conjugation lengths, etc.6,7,16–28 As one of key components in the A–D–A-structured NFAs, the electron-donating core (D) plays an important role in determining the photovoltaic performance of NFAs. So far, most of high-performance NFAs (e.g., ITIC, IEIC, IT-4F) employed indaceno[3,2-b]dithiophene or indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDT and IDTT in Scheme 1) as the electron-donating core,16,18,26,29–33 while the NFAs based on other electron-donating cores showed inferior photovoltaic performance.6,16,34–37 Researchers have attributed the high-performance of the IDT- and IDTT-based NFAs to their C2h-symmetry with the sp3 carbons at two different sides along the π-conjugated molecular backbone, which would prevent severely aggregations of the active layer materials.16 Consequently, some other C2h-symmetric cores such as 6T, IBDT, CBDT (in Scheme 1) have also been developed for constructing NFAs with PCEs over 11%.38–40 However, other electron-donating cores, especially some C2v-symmetric cores with the sp3 carbons in the same side along the π-conjugated molecular backbone, are less explored for NFAs, to some extent. It has been disclosed that molecules based on the C2v-symmetric cores may exhibit better crystallinity compared to those based on similar cores with C2h-symmetry due to the unique side chain arrangement, which is favorable for efficient charge transport in OSCs.41 In addition, molecules based on some C2v-symmetric cores may be prone to adopt a predominantly face-on molecular orientation which is also beneficial for high-performance OSCs.42 Recently, our group developed a C2v-symmetric building block with four alkyl chains in the same side along the π-conjugated molecular backbone, namely dithienocyclopentadibenzothiophene (DTCDBT in Scheme 1), which enabled the development of high-performance p-type copolymers with PCEs over 9.4%.43,44 The promising results imply that the C2v-symmetric DTCDBT may be an excellent electron-donating unit for constructing efficient n-type A–D–A-structured NFAs as well.

In this work, for the first time, DTCDBT with C2v-symmetry is used as an electron-donating core to synthesize high-performance NFAs. At the same time, four alkyl chains with good solubility are used to balance the solubility and crystallinity of the target NFAs. Furthermore, to tune the optoelectronic properties of target NFAs including bandgaps, energy levels, and mobilities etc., three terminal units with different electron-withdrawing abilities are introduced into the target NFAs. Chemical structures of the three NFAs (DBTTC, DBTIC and DBTIC-2F) are shown in Scheme 2. Using a wide-bandgap copolymer (PBDB-T in Fig. S1†) as the donor material, the best-performance DBTTC-based device exhibited an outstanding PCE of 11.25% with a large open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.972 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.25 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 67.04%. While the best-performance DBTIC- and DBTIC-2F-based devices showed lower PCEs of 9.66% and 6.81%, respectively.

2. Results and discussion

          2.1
         Material synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes for the target NFAs are illustrated in Scheme 2. The key electron-donating core of DTCDBT was synthesized in 57% yield through two steps including the double nucleophilic additions of compound 1 with (4-(2-butyloctyl)phenyl)lithium (freshly prepared from 1-bromo-4-(2-butyloctyl)benzene and n-BuLi), and the subsequently intramolecular cyclization with boron trifluoride-etherate (BF3·OEt2). The dicarbaldehyde derivative (DBT-CHO) was synthesized in 73% yield as a yellow solid by treating DTCDBT with phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) under reflux. The target NFAs DBTTC, DBTIC, and DBTIC-2F were prepared in yields of 85%, 71% and 66% by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction between DBT-CHO and 2-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophen-4-ylidene)malononitrile, 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile, and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile, respectively, using pyridine as a catalyst. The final compounds were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, high resolution mass spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. All the three NFAs show decent solubility in regular halogenated solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB), chloroform and dichloromethane. Thermogravimetric analysis results indicate that DBTTC, DBTIC and DBTIC-2F have good thermal stabilities with the high decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of 385 °C, 362 °C and 355 °C, respectively. The data are shown in Table 1 and Fig. S2.†

2.2 Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the NFAs in CB solution and in thin film are shown in Fig. 1a and b. In solution, the three NFAs show very similar absorption bands in the range of 500–680 nm. DBTTC has an absorption peak at 634 nm, while DBTIC and DBTIC-2F show slightly blue-shifted peaks of 623 and 633 nm, respectively. Among the three NFAs, DBTTC shows the largest molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 2.43 × 105 M−1 cm−1 compared with those of DBTIC (ε = 1.97 × 105 M−1 cm−1) and DBTIC-2F (ε = 2.16 × 105 M−1 cm−1) indicating the better light-harvesting ability of DBTTC. In thin film, all the NFAs show broader absorption bands at 500–800 nm with red-shifted absorption peaks (645 nm for DBTTC, 687 nm for DBTIC, and 720 nm for DBTIC-2F). The calculated optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of DBTTC, DBTIC and DBTIC-2F are 1.64, 1.67 and 1.62 eV, based on their absorption edges (λfilmonset) at 756, 742 and 765 nm, respectively. We further determined the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the NFAs by using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV profiles and energy diagrams are displayed in Fig. 1c and d. The oxidation/reduction potential onsets (Eox/Ered) are 1.10/−0.79 V for DBTTC, 1.09/−0.82 V for DBTIC, and 1.12/-0.74 V for DBTIC-2F, respectively. Thus, the LUMO/HOMO energy levels are −4.03/−5.92 eV for DBTTC, −4.00/−5.91 eV for DBTIC, and −4.08/−5.94 eV for DBTIC-2F, respectively, corresponding to the electrochemical bandgaps of 1.89, 1.91 and 1.86 eV (Table 1). Although there are some small differences between the electrochemical bandgap and the optical bandgap of each NFA, the change trends for both the electrochemical and optical bandgaps of NFAs are the same. Furthermore, the frontier molecular orbitals of the NFAs were calculated by using the density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP/6-311G** level. As shown in Fig. 1e, terminal units with different electron-withdrawing abilities show significant influence on their LUMO/HOMO energy levels. For example, the terminal unit in DBTIC-2F has the strongest electron-withdrawing ability among the three NFAs, thus leading to its lowest-lying LUMO/HOMO energy levels. Both LUMO and HOMO energy levels calculated for the three NFAs are in the following order: DBTIC > DBTTC > DBTIC-2F. These results are consistent with those obtained from the CV measurement. However, the terminal groups only have neglectable impact on the electron-state-density distribution of NFAs. The electron-state densities of HOMO for all the three molecules are mainly distributed at the DTCDBT core, while those of LUMO are localized at both the central core and the terminal groups, indicating strong intramolecular charge transfer between the electron-donating core and the terminal electron-withdrawing units.38

(d) Energy level diagrams of the NFAs and PBDB-T. (e) The frontier molecular orbitals for the nonfullerene acceptors obtained by DFT calculations. 
When a benchmark wide-bandgap copolymer of PBDB-T is selected as an electron donor material, DBTIC-2F exhibits more complementary absorption in comparison with DBTTC or DBTIC (Fig. 1b). However, the higher-lying LUMO energy levels of DBTTC and DBTIC, in comparison with that of DBTIC-2F, will lead to larger VOCs of the corresponding OSCs because the VOC is associated with the difference between the HOMO energy level of polymer donor and the LUMO energy level of NFA. At the same time, both the LUMO and HOMO energy offsets between PBDB-T and NFAs are large enough for effective charge transfer between the donor and the NFAs in the blend films (Fig. 1d).
To understand the charge transfer behavior of the donor and acceptor materials in the blend films, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pure donor/acceptor films and their blend films were recorded (Fig. S3†). When excited at 550 nm, the donor PBDB-T showed a strong emission band at around 620–850 nm. With an excitation at 650 nm, all the three NFAs exhibited strong emission bands at around 700–890 nm. For the blend films (PBDB-T:DBTTC, PBDB-T:DBTIC or PBDB-T:DBTIC-2F), the PL of PBDB-T was nearly all quenched by the NFAs when excited at the wavelength of 550 nm. Similarly, PL of the three NFAs in the blend films was also completely quenched by the donor of PBDB-T when excited at the wavelength of 650 nm. These results indicate that there are efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer between the PBDB-T donor and the NFAs.
2.3 Photovoltaic properties
OSCs with an inverted device configuration (indium tin oxide glass/ZnO/donor:acceptor/MoO3/Ag) were fabricated in order to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the three NFAs. We first fabricated OSCs based on all the NFAs under the same conditions to find the best acceptor. As shown in Table S1,† DBTTC-based devices showed a higher PCE of 9.55% in comparison to DBTIC- or DBTIC-2F-based devices. As a consequence, we carried out the device optimizations on DBTTC. By tuning donor/acceptor weight ratio, concentration of the mixture solution, and spin-coating speed (Tables S2–S4†), the optimal active layer with a thickness of ∼100 nm was obtained. Then, all the devices were fabricated by spin-coating the mixture solutions (16 mg mL−1 in CB with or without additive with a donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:1) at 3300 rpm for 60 s. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best-performance devices with and without additive are shown in Fig. 2a and S4a,† respectively, and the device parameters are listed in Table 2. Without any additive, the DBTTC-based devices showed a PCE of 9.88% with a VOC of 0.962 V, a JSC of 15.63 mA cm−2, and a FF of 65.64%. Under the same condition, DBTIC-based devices exhibited a comparable PCE of 9.43% with a high VOC of 0.994 V, a JSC of 14.77 mA cm−2, and a FF of 64.21%; while the devices based on DBTIC-2F showed a relatively lower PCE of 6.81%, due to the lower VOC of 0.799 V and FF of 56.27%. Furthermore, the device performance of NFAs can be further improved by using additive (Table S5†). As shown in Table 2, when a mixture of additives containing 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and diphenyl ether (DPE) (0.3% for each, v/v), was used to modify the film morphology, the DBTTC-based devices showed a greatly improved PCE of 11.25% with an enlarged VOC of 0.972 V, an increased JSC of 17.25 mA cm−2, and an enhanced FF of 67.04%. Similarly, the devices based on DBTIC with additive also exhibited an improved PCE of 9.66% with a VOC of 1.004 V, a JSC of 15.48 mA cm−2, and a FF of 62.22%. Compared to the devices based on DBTTC and DBTIC with additive, the devices based on DBTIC-2F with additive showed a decreased PCE of 6.26% with a decreased JSC of 13.44 mA cm−2. Among the three NFAs, DBTIC achieved the highest VOC, which is attributed to its higher-lying LUMO level.

External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of all the best-performance devices with or without additive were investigated and the results are depicted in Fig. 2b and S4b.† As shown in the figures, EQE spectra for all the devices cover the wavelength range of 300–800 nm, which is consistent with the corresponding absorption spectra of the three NFAs blended with PBDB-T. It can be found that the average EQE values for DBTTC- and DBTIC-based devices increased with additive. However, those of the DBTIC-2F-based devices decreased with additive, in agreement with the corresponding JSC variations. On the other hand, the calculated JSC values from the EQE data of all the best-performance devices agree well with those obtained from the J–V measurements (<5% mismatch) (Table 2).
2.4 Charge carrier generation, recombination and transport
To know the exciton dissociation and charge generation efficiencies of the best-performance devices, the relationships between photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) for the best-performance devices with or without additive were studied. As shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. S5a,† the Jph reached saturation (Jsat) when Veff is over 2 V. The JSC/Jsat ratios, indicating charge dissociation probability,45 for the devices based on the three NFAs with additive (or without additive) are 98% (97%) for DBTTC, 96% (94%) for DBTIC, and 93% (93%) for DBTIC-2F, respectively. These results demonstrate that all these devices have efficient charge dissociation. On the other hand, the dependence of JSC on the light intensity (P), which reflects the bimolecular recombination in devices,46 was also investigated. The relationship between JSC and Plight can be described by using the formula of JSC ∝ Plightα, and the bimolecular recombination is weak when α is close to 1. As shown in Fig. 2d, the α values of the devices based on DBTTC, DBTIC and DBTIC-2F with additive are 0.961, 0.958 and 0.932, respectively. And the corresponding devices without additive show α values of 0.955, 0.954 and 0.948, respectively (Fig. S5b†). The results imply that there is negligible bimolecular recombination in all the devices. However, a larger JSC/Jsat ratio or α value generally relates to a higher PCE of the corresponding device.
To study the charge transport properties in the devices, we measured the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of the PBDB-T:DBTTC, PBDB-T:DBTIC and PBDB-T:DBTIC-2F blend films by using the space charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Table 3, Fig. S6†). Both μh and μe values of the blends with or without additive follow the order: PBDB-T:DBTTC > PBDB-T:DBTIC > PBDB-T:DBTIC-2F. For the PBDB-T:DBTTC and PBDB-T:DBTIC blends, the introduction of additive leads to both increased μh and μe values with more balanced charge transport (decreased μh/μe ratios). The results agree with the improved performance for the devices based on PBDB-T:DBTTC and PBDB-T:DBTIC with additive in comparison with the additive-free counterparts. However, for the PBDB-T:DBTIC-2F blend, the incorporation of additive leads to a decreased hole mobility with an unbalanced μh/μe ratio of 8.21 which explains the reason for the decreased PCE of the device based on PBDB-T:DBTIC-2F with additive.

2.5 Morphology
To get an insight into the surface morphology of blend films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out. The AFM height and phase images of the blend films with additive and without additive are shown in Fig. 3a–c and S7,† respectively. Both PBDB-T:DBTTC and PBDB-T:DBTIC films with or without additive showed uniform surfaces with clear phase separation. At the same time, clear fibrillar structures were formed for both the active layer blends. With additive, PBDB-T:DBTTC showed increased root-mean-square (Rq) roughness of 2.34 nm in comparison with 1.43 nm for the additive-free blend. Similarly, PBDB-T:DBTIC with additive exhibited an increased Rq value of 2.87 nm compared with 2.40 nm for the additive-free counterpart. The increased Rq values for PBDB-T:DBTTC and PBDB-T:DBTIC with additive indicate the improved crystallinity of the nano-fibrillar structures, which may explain the reason for the PCE enhancement of the corresponding devices with additive. However, the PBDB-T:DBTIC-2F films, either with or without additive, exhibited less clear phase separation, leading to lower FFs and PCEs for the corresponding OSCs. PBDB-T:DBTIC-2F with additive showed a Rq value of 1.29 nm in comparison with a Rq value of 1.37 nm for PBDB-T:DBTIC-2F without additive. The results suggest that the additive barely helps to improve the crystallinity as well as the phase separation of the blend film, which is consistent with the inferior device performance for the device with additive. The surface morphology changes of the PBDB-T:DBTTC blend film with additive were further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 4, with the additive processing, the PDBD-T:DBTTC blend film exhibited a more uniform image with some fibrillar structures which is favorable for efficient charge transport.47 However, for the as-cast film based on PDBD-T:DBTTC, less fibrillar structures were observed. The improved morphology is one of the main contributions to the increased charge mobilities and PCE of the PDBD-T:DBTTC-based device with additive.

3. Conclusions
In summary, a C2v-symmetric core (DTCDBT) was used to design and synthesize a series of high-performance NFAs, for the first time. The three NFAs (DBTTC, DBTIC and DBTIC-2F) exhibited good thermal stabilities with tunable energy levels and bandgaps. With additive, the best-performance device based on PBDB-T:DBTTC displayed an outstanding efficiency of 11.25% together with a large VOC of 0.972 V, a JSC of 17.25 mA cm−2 and a FF of 67.04%. However, the best-performance devices based on DBTIC and DBTIC-2F showed lower PCEs of 9.66% and 6.81%, respectively. The improved performance for PBDB-T:DBTTC-based device is related to its optimal phase morphology thereby leading to increased carrier mobilities, improved exciton dissociation and charge generation efficiencies. These results suggest that DTCDBT is an excellent electron-donating core for constructing high-performance NFAs which may have great potential to boost the PCEs of OSCs further. By using other efficient polymer donors with complementary absorption, even better performance may be expected for this novel class of NFAs with C2v-symmetry.

         Synthesis

Synthesis of DTCDBT. 
1-Bromo-4-(2-butyloctyl)benzene (4.05 g, 12.5 mmol) and 20 mL of anhydrous THF were added into a nitrogen-filled two neck round-bottom flask. The mixture was cooled to −78 °C, and then n-BuLi (5.0 mL, 2.5 M in hexane) was added dropwise to the solution during a period of 30 min. After the mixture was stirred at −78 °C for about 1 h under nitrogen, a solution of compound 148 (0.93 g, 2 mmol) in 15 mL of THF was added by syringe over 30 min. The mixture was gradually warmed to 25 °C and stirred for 12 h, followed by quenching with 30 mL of saturated NH4Cl aqueous solution. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was collected, then washed with water and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The residue was obtained after the removal of solvent and used directly in next step without further purification.
The resulting residue was dissolved in 50 mL of degassed CH2Cl2, and then 4 mL of BF3·OEt2 was added slowly by a syringe. After being stirred for 50 min, the reaction mixture was quenched by 60 mL of MeOH, and then the solvents were removed to give a dark oily residue. The title compound DTCDBT was obtained as a yellow viscous oil after the purification of the residue through a short silica gel column (1.54 g, 57% for two steps). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, ppm): δ = 7.94 (s, 2H), 7.88 (s, 2H), 7.34 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, 2H), 7.17 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 8H), 7.04 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, 2H), 7.01 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 8H), 2.47 (d, J = 6.8 Hz, 8H), 1.31–1.23 (m, 68H), 0.88–0.84 (m, 24H); 13C NMR (CDCl3, 101 MHz, ppm): δ = 157.09, 151.15, 142.18, 141.57, 140.51, 139.29, 136.34, 133.52, 128.70, 128.59, 128.46, 127.94, 123.31, 119.24, 113.26, 62.70, 35.69, 32.03, 32.01, 31.55, 29.66, 29.61, 29.40, 22.82, 22.80, 14.28; MS (DART) m/z: calcd for C94H125S3 [M + H]+: 1349.9; found: 1349.9.


Synthesis of DBT-CHO. 
To a two-neck round-bottom flask containing 40 mL of 1,2-dichloroethane, DTCDBT (1.10 g, 0.81 mmol) and DMF (2.36 g, 32.4 mmol) were added. After the mixture was bubbled with nitrogen for 20 min at room temperature, POCl3 (5.02 g, 32.4 mmol) was syringed dropwise. After being bubbled with nitrogen for another 40 min, the reaction solution was heated to reflux for 18 h under nitrogen. Upon cooling to room temperature, 20 mL of saturated potassium acetate aqueous solution was added into the flask and stirred for 30 min. The mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2, then washed with water and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. After the organic solvent was removed by a rotary evaporator, a solid residue was obtained which was subjected to a further purification by silica gel chromatography. In final, the product DBT-CHO was given as a yellow solid (0.83 g, 73%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ = 9.88 (s, 2H), 8.07 (s, 2H), 8.01 (s, 2H), 7.69 (s, 2H), 7.17 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 8H), 7.04 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 8H), 2.49 (d, J = 6.8 Hz, 8H), 1.25–1.23 (m, 68H), 0.88–0.85 (m, 24H); 13C NMR (CDCl3, 101 MHz, ppm): δ = 183.11, 157.51, 151.97, 149.97, 146.64, 141.09, 140.95, 140.26, 135.24, 135.17, 132.34, 129.50, 127.61, 119.69, 115.41, 62.94, 40.16, 39.47, 33.27, 33.24, 32.87, 31.97, 29.82, 29.74, 28.80, 26.56, 23.10, 22.76, 14.24; MS (DART) m/z: calcd for C96H125O2S3 [M + H]+: 1405.8; found: 1405.9.
