    , Accepted 7th January 2019First published on 8th January 2019AbstractLow-temperature processing in perovskite films always results in the formation of submicrometer scale grains and consequent abundant defects that lead to carrier recombination, hysteresis and moisture degradation. Passivation of defects at either surface or grain boundaries (GBs) thus promises great advances for developing high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). By taking the co-passivation agent of 1H,1H-perfluorooctylamine (PFA) as the example, we present in this work a simple and effective surface & GB co-passivation strategy based on bifunctional molecules with fluorocarbon chains to achieve PSCs with highly improved photo-conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. It was demonstrated that such a co-passivation strategy leads to 53.3% PCE enhancement in the MAPbI3 type PSCs, as well as a champion PCE of 21.31% in CsFAMA type PSCs, and remarkable stability with 3% PCE loss after 2500 h of storage at a humidity of 70 ± 5% at room temperature. Our results thus show the great potential of surface & GB co-passivation by fluorocarbon based molecules for accessing high performance PSCs based on the protocols of defect manipulation.
Solution-processed lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the most intensive research areas in photovoltaic fields,1 owing to their achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 23.3% (ref. 2) that could challenge the established crystalline silicon and thin film solar cells. Among the notable advantages of PSCs, the facile low-temperature synthesis critically determines the potential for low-cost commercialization. This, however, would introduce abundant defects existing at either surface or grain boundaries (GBs) within the active layer, which incur trap-assisted non-radiative recombination as well as initialization of perovskite degradation by permeated moisture or oxygen.3 In this regard, defect passivation is highly desirable not only for further boosting the PCE to a new height but also for prolonging the durability of the PSCs. Surface passivation via coating molecules containing passivation groups, such as amino/ammonium,4 pyridine,5 and carboxyl,6 on the surface of the preformed perovskite layer, has been a direct route and showed preliminary success on efficiency and durability enhancement. A notable example is that benzylamine modification resulted in improved PCEs from 14.2% to 17.3% and prolonged moisture durability over 2900 h.4a
While considering the larger specific surface areas of GBs that act as centers for non-radiative recombination3a,7a–h than that of the perovskite layer surface, more performance enhancement is anticipated if strategies are developed for GB passivation. However, there has been a debate that GBs are inert toward charge recombination7i and might even be beneficial for charge separation.7j Recently, Jodlowski et al.8 demonstrated that adding the guanidinium cation into the perovskite precursors might lead to defect passivation of GBs, which gave rise to a high PCE of 20.15%. Similarly, the recently developed GB passivation by adding the passivation agents into the precursors,7h,8,9 post-treating the as-prepared perovskite films via passivation agents,10 and introducing the passivation agent via an anti-solvent,11 leads to a pronounced performance improvement. However, rarely any of them have taken the contribution of surface passivation into consideration, and it remains obscure in these studies if GB passivation plays a vital role in PCE enhancement. More recently, the Liu group addressed the importance of GB passivation by using semiconducting passivation molecules that could result in a PCE enhancement of up to 19.3%,12 while they found that surface passivation had almost negligible contribution. So far, defect passivation of perovskite films at either surface or GBs separately has been proven successful for the enhancement of the PSC efficiency and stability. It would be highly promising if a strategy can be developed by taking the advantages of both surface and GB passivation.
In the present study, by taking the co-passivation agent of 1H,1H-perfluorooctylamine (PFA) as the example, we demonstrate a surface and GB co-passivation strategy using the fluorocarbon based bifunctional molecules, which was found to be much more effective in decreasing the defect densities and inhibiting non-radiative recombination. By using the surface & GB co-passivation strategy, a remarkable 53.3% enhancement in PCE was achieved within the archetypal MAPbI3-based PSCs. Meanwhile, the cells demonstrated much improved moisture-durability owing to the hydrophobic fluorocarbon chain. We further applied such a co-passivation strategy to the mixed-cation lead mixed halide PSC, and achieved encouraging stable PSCs with a champion efficiency of 21.31%, which is among the best in the records of defect passivation related performance of PSCs.7h,8,9a–c,e,g,h,10–13
Owing to the strong binding energy of the amino group in PFA (Fig. 1a) with perovskite (calculated binding energy of 51.88 kJ mol−1 (ref. 14)), PFA is anticipated to be able to passivate the uncoordinated lead at both of the surface and GBs, as depicted in Fig. 1b. Experimentally, we intended to introduce CF3 based molecules to different locations of the perovskite layer through the following routes: (i) incorporating via an anti-solvent of chlorobenzene, and (ii) spin-coating on the preformed perovskite film, which is expected to result in surface & GB passivation and surface-only passivation (see Routes A and C in Scheme S1†), respectively. All the devices in the present work adopt the planar heterojunction configuration of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, and the formation process of perovskite and configuration of the perovskite device are shown in the ESI.† Similar to previous reports,14 we failed in producing a uniform film (Fig. S1 and S2a†) based on introduction of the passivation agent via precursors (Route B in Scheme S1†) owing possibly to the hydrophobic nature of PFA. We therefore adopted Routes A and C in the present study as experimentally they do not influence the formation of the homogeneous films with full surface coverage over the entire substrate (Fig. S1†). The produced films via Routes A and C are denoted as MAPbI3–PFA and MAPbI3/PFA respectively. For each route, PFA with different concentrations (0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 6.0 and 15 mg mL−1), denoted by PFA-1, PFA-2, PFA-3, PFA-4 and PFA-5, respectively, was used to explore the optimized passivation effects.

Fig. 1c and d depict the surface morphologies of the prepared MAPbI3/PFA and MAPbI3–PFA films, respectively. Different from the case that incorporates polymers into the perovskite layer via an anti-solvent which alters perovskite crystal formation,11 introduction of low concentration PFA in our study has little influence on the morphological change compared to the control film (without PFA), and there is also no significant grain-size alteration after PFA modifications (as seen in Fig. 1c, d, S2b and S3a–d). The cross-sectional SEM observations (Fig. S3g–i†) indicate that the MAPbI3–PFA film has a more uniform and dense surface, fewer voids, and smaller grain protrusions than those of MAPbI3/PFA and control films. The surface profiles of the films with different passivation ways revealed in AFM observations (Fig. 1e, f and S4†) demonstrate obviously different surface root-mean-square roughnesses: 11.0 nm for the MAPbI3–PFA film, 26.8 nm for the MAPbI3/PFA film and 27.2 nm for the control film. It is therefore clear that the strategy of co-passivation favors more for the formation of the perovskite film with better qualities than that of the control film. The improved film quality might be because the introduced passivant suppresses overcrystallization of PbI2, which is usually associated with nonuniform film coverage and pinhole formation.12 Further X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Fig. 1g) revealed the evident peak of F1s located at around 685.7 eV for both MAPbI3–PFA and MAPbI3/PFA films, illustrating the existence of PFA molecules on the surface of the both films. However, signals of F1s were not detected for both films (Fig. S5†) in the deep of the film, which might be due to the removal of light elements by a high energy Ar ion beam during the XPS depth profile characterization.
To further explore if the F element is present deep in the perovskite layer for the MAPbI3–PFA film, we employed energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in the cross-sectional SEM (SEM-EDS) observations. Fig. 1h shows the cross-sectional SEM image that depicts the six layers in the device. The SEM-EDS observation (see more details in Fig. S6†) revealed the distribution of the F element throughout the perovskite layer (indicated by the Pb element distribution) and the FTO layer (indicated by the Sn element distribution). An initial conclusion can thus be drawn that PFA is indeed present deep in the perovskite layer of the MAPbI3–PFA film. Comparatively, the F element was not detected in the perovskite layer by similar SEM-EDS observation (Fig. S6a†), which may be because such nanoscale thickness of F distribution on the surface is out of the resolution detection of the EDS analysis. Therefore, these results clearly demonstrate that the F element does not exist in perovskite in the case of surface-only passivation while F element exists throughout the perovskite layer in the case of surface & GB co-passivation. By using the EDS in transmission electron microscopy cross-sectional characterization, we further intended but failed to verify if the F element distributes only in the GB locations of the perovskite layer, owing to the easy damage of the layer structure15 during sample preparation (see Fig. S7†). Finally we have to exclude the existence of PFA in the perovskite lattice via X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, which is shown in Fig. 1i and S8.† All the XRD patterns of perovskite films with or without PFA modification showed strong diffraction peaks of MAPbI3 located at approximately 14.15° and 28.5° (2θ) with no clear presence of a secondary phase. This indicates that introducing the passivation molecules in the present study does not influence perovskite crystallinity, which is in agreement with previous reports.16 The above characterization indicates that the passivation molecule decorates the surface and GBs throughout the depth of the films, which is similar to a recent study reported by the Liu Group.12 Comparatively, route C of surface coating can only bring PFA to the surface of the perovskite layer as evidenced by XPS analysis and SEM-EDS characterization above (Fig. S6†).Therefore, the surface & GB copassivation in the MAPbI3–PFA film and surface-only passivation in the MAPbI3/PFA film shown in Scheme S1† can be respectively confirmed. It is thus of great interest to further explore their impacts on the PSC performance.
The photovoltaic properties of PSCs were characterized systematically and the results were summarized in Fig. S9 and Tables S1 and S2.† It was found that the PFA concentrations play important roles in the performance of PSCs, and the champion efficiency locates at the concentration of PFA-4 for both types of devices (Fig. S9†). Fig. 2a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves (measured under simulated AM1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2) of the champion devices via different passivation methods. The scan rate for all the J–V curves in the present study is 0.2 V s−1. The champion efficiency of the co-passivation device reached 16.18%, while that of the device via surface-only passivation reached 14.48%, and the device without passivation (control device) reached 12.71%. As shown in Fig. 2a, compared to the obvious hysteresis in the control device and less-visible hysteresis in the surface-only passivated device, the co-passivated device demonstrated a much more reduced and virtually negligible hysteresis. This result indicates that GB passivation is important to help reduce/eliminate the hysteresis in PSCs. To have an overview of the passivation effects on PSC performance, the histograms of more than 48 solar cells with different passivation strategies are shown in Fig. 2b. It can be seen that the devices via the surface-only passivation and co-passivation exhibited narrower PCE distributions than those of the control devices, indicating the improved reproducibility by the passivation strategies. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of cell devices depicted in Fig. 2c indicate that the co-passivation results increase over the entire visible-light range and broad plateaus with a maximum value over 90%, reflecting a high charge-collection efficiency of the PSCs. The calculated integrated short-circuit current density (Jsc) values are 20.09, 20.39 and 21.63 mA cm−2 for devices of control, surface-only passivation, and co-passivation, respectively, which match well with the values obtained from the J–V curves in Fig. 2a. It should be noted that the average efficiencies of the devices (Fig. 2b) illustrate an obvious PCEs increase of 53.3% for device via co-passivation (from 10.12% to 15.51%), which is much higher than the increase of the devices via surface-only passivation (25.7% increase, from 10.12 to 12.72%) and other similar studies.7h,8,9a–c,e,g,h,10–13

Further work is undertaken to clarify why co-passivation leads to much higher PSC performance. It was found that surface-only passivation had little effect on UV-vis absorption of the resulting films (Fig. S10a†), while the co-passivated film showed improved UV-vis absorption performance owing possibly to the improved film quality as described above (Fig. S10b†), which is in agreement with the EQE results (Fig. 2c). In addition, the co-passivation was shown to be able to decrease the charge transfer resistance (see Fig. S11†), indicating the higher efficiency of hole extraction as well as the higher fill factor (FF), which is in line with the previous report.17 The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of the perovskite films deposited on TiO2/FTO substrates is shown in Fig. 2d and S12a† revealed that the PL intensity gradually increases as the concentration of PFA increases in the MAPbI3 film. But the intensity for the surface-only passivated film is lower than that of the co-passivated film (Fig. 2d) indicating the low passivation effect of the surface-only modification. Interestingly, the PL intensity of the MAPbI3–PFA-5 device is higher than that of MAPbI3–PFA-4 but the PCE is lower, which can be further explained by a clear PL quenching for the MAPbI3–PFA-4/spiro-OMeTAD film but not for MAPbI3–PFA-5/spiro-OMeTAD (see Fig. S12b†), owing possibly to the formation of the too-thick PFA layer that blocks the hole transport.
The carrier dynamics of the perovskite films were investigated to gain more insight into the mechanism of the increased PSC performance. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements shown in Fig. 2e, revealed a much faster PL decay for the control than for the PFA-treated films. The PL decay curves were fitted to the following bi-exponential rate law: Y = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + y0(1)where A1 and A2 are the relative amplitudes, τ1 and τ2 is the lifetime for the fast and slow decay, respectively, and the PL lifetime is considered as the average of the fast and slow lifetimes.18 The fast decay is related to trap-assisted recombination at defects, whereas the slow decay is related to radiative recombination inside the grains. As shown in Table S3,† the co-passivated film exhibits an average lifetime of τavg = 95.85 ns with τ1 = 23.7 ns and τ2 = 121.2 ns. In contrast, the surface-only passivated film gives τavg = 72.98 ns with τ1 = 18.3 ns and τ2 = 102.7 ns, and the control film τavg = 9.75 ns with τ1 = 2.9 ns, τ2 = 17.8 ns. The dramatically increased lifetimes of the co-passivated and surface-only passivated films indicate the lower defect densities due to the PFA passivation. Further, the longer lifetime of the co-passivated film than that of surface-only film indicates that the GB passivation is helpful for further inhibiting trap-assisted recombination, which is consistent with the higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the FF of the corresponding PSC.19 As reported in the literature,9a,f the reduction of the defects by PFA passivation in bulk perovskite films could also explain the reduced hysteresis in our work.
It should be noted that the PFA we adopt for the co-passivation strategy has actually two functions, e.g., defect passivation and moisture durability inhibition, owing to its amino and fluorocarbon chain, respectively. It varies largely from those adopted passivation agents such as quaternary ammonium,4b where the bearing anions might have adverse effects on the performances and stabilities of PSCs.20 It has been reported that Lewis bases (PFA used in our work is a typical Lewis base) can form coordination with the uncoordinated Pb.5,14 The coordination can be probed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Fig. S13†). The FTIR analysis illustrated that the reaction between PFA and the perovskite resulted in the shift of the N–H peak in PFA from 1632.5 to 1644.5 cm−1, while the N–H peak in the perovskite has almost no change (from 1645.5 to 1644.5 cm−1), which reflected the coordination of PFA with the unbonded Pb in perovskite, similar to the previous report on PVP modification of perovskite.14 The passivation mechanism for PFA was further confirmed by XPS analysis. As shown in Fig. 2f, there are two main peaks of Pb4f7/2 and Pb4f5/2 at 138.0 and 142.8 eV for films with and without PFA modification. The two small peaks located at 136.4 and 141.3 eV are ascribed to the presence of unbonded metallic Pb for the control sample.5b,11,21 The fact that the two metallic Pb peaks disappear after we add PFA (Fig. 2f) is in agreement with the literature,5b,11 which ascribed the disappearing of these two metallic peaks to the passivation effect of the Lewis bases. We thereby propose the passivation mechanism for PFA:PFA, as a weak Lewis base, donates a lone pair of electrons on N to the empty 6p orbital of Pb on the perovskite grain surface, forming a coordination bond. We further collected the dark I–V characteristics of electron-only devices for calculating the trap state densities of MAPbI3 films with or without PFA passivation (Fig. 2g–i). We found that the trap densities significantly decrease from 2.88 × 1016 to 9.34 × 1015 and 1.36 × 1015 cm−3 for the control, surface-only passivation and co-passivation films, respectively. This result further proves that co-passivation is more effective than surface-only passivation for remediating defects in the perovskite film.
It was revealed in previous studies22 that the degradation of perovskite films was generally initialized at the defect sites at the film surface or GBs, where the perovskite molecules are more susceptible to be attacked by moisture and oxygen. Owing to the hydrophobic nature of PFA, as shown in Fig. 3a, the addition of PFA via different routes resulted in the increase of the contact angle from 39.2° (control) to 66.8 (MAPbI3/PFA-4) and 68.0° (MAPbI3–PFA-4), respectively. We thus compared the moisture-resistance of the different films by exposing them in a constant temperature and humidity chamber (25 °C, 50 ± 5% RH). The degradation process can be traced through the film color change (Fig. 3b and c) and the emergence of PbI2 (characterized by XRD, see Fig. 3d). After the ambient exposure for 30 days, the pristine MAPbI3 film completely changed to a yellow color and showed a distinct PbI2 characteristic peak, but the MAPbI3–PFA-4 film still exhibited its original black color and showed no impurity of PbI2. The MAPbI3/PFA-4 film showed a visible PbI2 peak in the XRD observation (Fig. 3d) compared to MAPbI3–PFA-4, suggesting the distinguished effect of GB passivation for improved durability. The stabilities of the PSCs with and without PFA modifications were also monitored by monitoring the unencapsulated devices in the same environment (25 °C, 50 ± 5% RH), and the device performances are summarized in Fig. 3e. The PCE of the control device quickly dropped below 20% of its initial PCE after 500 h, while the device with the surface-only passivation can retain over 83% of its initial PCE after 800 h. In contrast, the device with co-passivation maintained 95% of its initial PCE after 800 h. These results conclusively confirm that the films treated by co-passivation exhibited better moisture-resistance than that of surface-only passivation, as shown in Fig. 3f, reflecting the important role of GB passivation in moisture durability.

Though the presented surface & GB co-passivation strategy could result in a maximum 53.3% PCE enhancement for the MAPbI3 solar cell (Fig. 2b), the achieved PCE of 16.18% is still far from satisfactory (much lower than that of 20.15% achieved by Jodlowski et al.8). To further explore if the presented co-passivation strategy is suitable for constructing higher performance PSCs, we introduced PFA in a similar manner into the cesium-containing triple cation perovskite layer, which is the main photoactive material that our laboratory is focusing on. The perovskite with a formula of Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95PbI2.55Br0.45 (CsFAMA) was prepared according to the literature method.1c,23 The detailed characterization of the prepared CsFAMA film can be found in the ESI† (see the analyses of UV-Vis, PL, XPS, XRD spectra and SEM morphologies in Fig. S14–S18†). Similarly, to confirm the incorporation of PFA into the CsFAMA films, SEM-EDS analysis was performed to reveal the element distribution. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the cross-sectional SEM images demonstrated the six layers of the solar cell architecture, and it can be seen that the distribution of F element throughout the perovskite layer (indicated by the Pb element distribution) and the FTO layer (indicated by the Sn element distribution), indicate the involvement of F elements at the surface and GBs in the perovskite layer if combing the characterization of XPS (Fig. S15 and S19†) and XRD analysis (Fig. S18†). Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) was employed again to study the passivation effect of PFA at GBs by characterizing the SP difference between GBs and inner grains of the CsFAMA films. Fig. 4c and d exhibit the SP images of the control and CsFAMA–PFA films on the FTO/TiO2 substrate. As can be clearly seen, the GBs in the control film show 50–60 mV higher SP than that of the inner grains whereas the GBs and inner grains in the CsFAMA–PFA film only show a less than 20 mV difference in SP (Fig. 4e), which indicates that the photo-generated charge carriers in co-passivated films can be transported through the GB easily.8

Fig. 4f shows the statistics of 50 control and 80 co-passivated CsFAMA devices collected over 25 different batches. We note the improvements in all device parameters and especially in the standard deviation, which is a metric for the reproducibility: the average Voc was improved from 1.07 to 1.12 V, the average Jsc improved from 22.88 to 23.47 mA cm−2, the average FF improved from 71.38 to 75.98%, and the average PCE improved from 17.47 to 19.97%. In Fig. 4g, we show the performance of the optimized co-passivation device with a champion PCE of 21.31% and negligible hysteresis. The EQE of the champion device is shown in Fig. S20,† the integrated Jsc from the EQE measurements agreed well with the Jsc values from J–V measurements in Fig. 4g. The photovoltaic parameters of the champion devices are summarized in Table 1. To determine the stabilized (scan speed-independent) PCEs and mimick the real working conditions, we probed a CsFAMA–PFA PSC with a PCE of 21.00% at its maximum power point under ambient conditions (relative humidity of 60%) under full-sun illumination (AM 1.5G) and a constant bias voltage (Fig. 4h). We recorded a stabilized PCE of 20.85% for the CsFAMA–PFA device after 90 min. However, a CsFAMA device with an initial PCE of 17.3% degraded to 5% after 90 min. The ambient stability of the CsFAMA devices by co-passivation was also examined under high humidity conditions (70 ± 5% RH). As shown in Fig. 4i, the PCE of the CsFAMA devices was reduced to zero after 500 h, while the CsFAMA devices by co-passivation still maintained 97% of their initial efficiency even after 2500 h.

It should be noted that the achieved 53.3% PCE enhancement in the MAPbI3 type PSCs as well as a champion PCE of 21.31% in the CsFAMA type PSCs based on the presented surface & GB co-passivation strategy are among the best in the records of the defect passivation related PSC performance, as shown in Table 2.7h,8,9a–c,e,g,h,10–13 Inspired by the highly improved performance by copassivation of PFA, we have tried to use a series of molecules with a similar structure to PFA, which have fluorocarbon chains as well as different defect passivation groups. Our current experimental results reveal that co-passivation based on such molecules is generally able to improve the PCEs of the PSCs over 20%. These results indicate that the presented surface & GB co-passivation strategy is universal and highly promising for accessing high performance PSCs with improved hysteresis, moisture stability and efficiency.

In summary, we have presented a simple and general co-passivation strategy that combines the advantages of both surface and GB passivation that has been proven to be successful for the enhancement of the PSC efficiency and stability. The defect densities were effectively decreased and the non-radiative recombination of the perovskite layer was much inhibited by introducing PFA which is very effective at decreasing the defect concentration and inhibiting non-radiative recombination. Our results in the present study indicate that the co-passivation agent of PFA decorates the surface and GBs throughout the depth of the films. Based on the performance comparisons of the PSCs constructed by the surface-only passivation and surface & GB co-passivation, we can conclude that co-passivation is much more effective for enhancing the PSC performance than that of surface-only passivation. Owing to the hydrophobic feature of the fluorocarbon chain in the co-passivation agent of PFA, the co-passivated CsFAMA PSCs maintained their initial efficiency even after 2500 h of storage with a humidity of 70 ± 5% at room temperature. The achieved 53.3% PCE enhancement in MAPbI3 type PSCs as well as a champion PCE of 21.31% in CsFAMA type PSCs based on the presented surface & GB co-passivation strategy, show the great potential of the presented surface & GB co-passivation strategy for boosting the PSC performance based on the protocols of defect manipulation.
