    , Accepted 26th November 2013First published on 27th November 2013AbstractElectrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) offers a new approach for bio-oil stabilization (a.k.a. partial upgrading). Water-soluble bio-oil, obtained by aqueous extraction of the liquid product of biomass pyrolysis, was hydrogenated using ECH at room conditions. A new electrocatalyst, ruthenium supported on activated carbon cloth, was used as the catalytic cathode. After electrocatalytic hydrogenation, aldehydes and ketones were reduced to the corresponding alcohols or diols, forms less prone to condensation chemistry. Carbon recovery into the liquid product, important when making liquid fuels from biomass, was more than 80%, while less than 0.1 wt% of the water-soluble bio-oil formed solid precipitate. The stability of the ECH-treated water-soluble bio-oil was checked via an accelerated aging test followed by size exclusion chromatography analysis and viscometry. Besides stabilization of bio-oil for subsequent fuel production, hydrogen and valuable diols were produced during ECH. Strategies to optimize the energy efficiency of this approach by altering the cell design, modifying the catalyst and adjusting the reaction conditions were also explored.
1. Introduction
Fast pyrolysis is a thermochemical method for liquefying biomass. The product “bio-oil” has a much higher bulk density than the original feedstock; fast pyrolysis is thus an effective way to densify biomass for storage and transport. By deploying pyrolysis in regional biomass pyrolysis depots (RBPDs) near harvesting areas, the cost of biomass transport to central refineries may be reduced. However, high concentrations of carboxylic acids, mainly formic acid and acetic acid, make bio-oil corrosive to metal storage containers and pipes used for transport. Also, with many carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones) and phenolic lignin fragments that readily condense into polymers, bio-oil is chemically reactive. It thus requires stabilization at the RBPDs prior to transport to a central refinery for hydrodeoxygenation to make hydrocarbon fuels.
Heterogeneous catalytic hydrotreatment of bio-oil has been studied by several groups.1–4 Specifically, Huber's group used mild hydrogenation with Ru/C at 125–175 °C and 52–100 bar to reduce aldehydes, ketones, and sugars to their corresponding alcohol or polyol forms.1–3 The products showed better thermal stability than the carbonyl-containing starting materials, forming less coke upon further upgrading.3 Venderbosch et al.4 also applied mild hydrotreating using Ru/C catalyst and observed carbon–carbon and carbon–oxygen double bond hydrogenation at 175 °C and pressures over 200 bar. When the temperature was increased to 225 °C, phase separation occurred due to water formation, presumably via condensation and hydrodeoxygenation. Gagnon and Kaliaguine5 investigated a mild hydrogenating pretreatment over a Ru catalyst, with optimum conditions at 80 °C and 41 bar. Though decreased by hydrotreatment, catalyst coking upon further upgrading remains substantial (18.9 wt%)2 as bio-oil rapidly polymerizes and coats the catalyst. Therefore, even milder methods of stabilization are needed to minimize polymerization and subsequent catalyst deactivation.
Homogeneous catalytic hydrotreatment of bio-oil with hydrogen has also been explored as a mild (<100 °C and 10–30 bar) stabilization method. Huang et al.6 used dichlorotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium to hydrogenate aldehydes and bio-oil at temperatures between 55 °C and 90 °C, and hydrogen pressures between 13 and 33 bar. The majority of the aldehydes and ketones were reduced to alcohols while compounds with carbon–carbon double bonds were typically saturated. Mahfud et al. applied a homogeneous ruthenium catalyst to hydrogenate bio-oil model compounds, the water-soluble fraction of bio-oil,7 and the dichloromethane-soluble fraction of bio-oil8 in a two-phase aqueous organic system. With this approach they observed the reduction of aldehydes and ketones to alcohols. The Shvo catalyst has also been used at 90–145 °C and a pressure of 10 bar to hydrogenate bio-oil derived from the pyrolysis of white poplar.9 Besides hydrogenating aldehydes, ketones and non-aromatic double bonds, this catalytic system promoted the hydrolysis of sugar oligomers into monomers.
To implement fast pyrolysis in RBPDs, inexpensive stabilization methods that can be supported at small scales are needed. Though the homogeneous catalysis strategies above can operate under mild temperatures, the high cost of separation poses a barrier. As such, the cost of fresh catalyst feed is typically higher than for the purchase of heterogeneous catalysts. Hydrogen's low solubility in aqueous solutions requires that it be pressurized, a need that would add significant expense and pose a second barrier to implementation. For these reasons, bio-oil upgrading with hydrotreatment is not economically practical at small and medium scales. Thus an alternative reduction method is required to stabilize the bio-oil in RBPDs. Recently, we demonstrated that electrocatalytic hydrogenation can be used to hydrogenate model compounds such as furfural10 and phenolic compounds.11 In this work, we explore the use of electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) to stabilize or partially upgrade bio-oil. Instead of molecular hydrogen, electricity produced from renewable sources, such as photovoltaic cells or wind turbines, will be used to split water, supplying the reducing hydrogen equivalents needed in situ. Besides bio-oil stabilization under mild conditions, this approach will buffer the grid from the intermittency of wind and solar electricity production by storing energy in stabilized bio-oil. Atomic hydrogen formed in situ on the catalytic cathode surface directly reduces the bio-oil compounds without passing through the gas phase.10 The surface hydrogen atom concentration is controlled by the applied electrode potential, so the reaction can take place at very mild conditions, such as ambient pressure and temperature. As the catalyst is monolithic, elaborate and expensive catalyst recovery is not required, a further advantage of this approach.
In the present investigation, the water-soluble fraction of bio-oil (WSBO) was subjected to ECH as it contains most of the carboxylic acids and carbonyl groups that are in raw bio-oil. Water-soluble bio-oil is difficult to upgrade using traditional hydrotreatment as water is detrimental to most catalysts at high temperatures. Sharma and Bakhshi12 reported that large amounts of water in bio-oil adversely influenced the activity of HZSM-5 by reducing the number of acid sites on the catalyst surface. But water is not a problem for a catalytic cathode that affects ECH of bio-oil in aqueous medium. The goal of this research was to explore the reaction chemistry that occurs during stabilization. To this end, WSBO and stabilized WSBO were chemically characterized using GC/MS, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and total organic carbon (TOC) analysis.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Bio-oil
Bio-oil was produced by pyrolysis of poplar DN34 in a bench-scale screw-conveyor fast pyrolysis reactor,13 followed by immediate cooling and storage at −3 °C. Major elements and bulk properties are shown in Table S1† and abundant chemical compounds in bio-oil are shown in Table S2.† The ultimate analysis of bio-oil was carried out using combustion with CHNS analyzers at Atlantic Microlabs (Norcross, Georgia). Methanol insoluble solids were measured according to Oasmaa et al.14 Bio-oil density and pH were measured with a DMA 35 Anton Paar GmbH density meter (Austria) and an Oakton 510 pH meter, respectively. Water content was measured using a Metrohm 870 KF Titrino Plus titrator (Metrohm USA, Riverview, FL).
Bio-oil was dissolved in methanol and analyzed via GC/MS (Shimadzu QP5050A) on a Restek Rtx-1701 column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA), 60 m × 0.25 mm with a 0.25 um film thickness. The column gas flow was 1 cm s−1 with a split ratio of 1:100. The GC oven temperature program began with a 1 minute hold at 40 °C followed by heating at 8 °C min−1 to 270 °C. The injector and detector temperature was set at 280 °C. The mass spectra were recorded in electron ionization mode for m/z 28 to 400. Identification of compounds was performed by comparing the mass spectra of the peaks with standard spectra of other compounds using the NIST library to obtain the most probable matches. Pure compounds (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO) were then used to confirm identities of major peaks based on matching of retention times and mass spectra. Four-point calibration curves were constructed using methanol solutions of external standards to relate concentration to peak area response, and used to quantify observed products.
Sugars in the bio-oil (levoglucosan, glucose and xylose) were determined using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system equipped with a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H analytical column and a refractive index detector. The mobile phase was 0.005 M sulfuric acid with a flow rate of 0.6 mL min−1. Column temperature was set as 65 °C for sugar analysis. External standards were used to identify and quantify these sugars.
2.2. Water-soluble bio-oil
Water-soluble bio-oil (WSBO) was obtained by mixing bio-oil with water, followed by 30 minutes of sonication. The mixture was then centrifuged and the top layer was decanted to use as the WSBO fraction. Before each experiment, the WSBO was filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe filter.
The water to bio-oil ratio influences phase separation and organic compound recovery in the aqueous phase. Mercader et al.15 found that when the water to bio-oil ratio was 1:10, there was no phase separation. In our experiments, when the ratio increased to 1:8, phase separation was observed (see ESI, Fig. S1†). As the amount of water increased, more organic material was extracted into the aqueous layer. However, the final concentration of bio-oil components in the aqueous layer is decreased due to dilution. As a demonstration, a water to bio-oil ratio at 4:1 was used, with the final bio-oil concentration at 15 wt% of the aqueous solution. To reduce the electrocatalytic hydrogenation reaction time, a two-fold dilution of this WSBO preparation was used for subsequent experiments.
2.3. Catalyst preparation
The method to prepare ruthenium catalysts supported on activated carbon cloth (ACC) has been previously described.11 Briefly, a piece of ACC (1.3 cm × 3.0 cm) (Calgon Carbon Co, Zorflex® ACC FM100) was first soaked in enough Ru(NH3)6Cl3 solution to saturate the ACC pores. After the ACC pores were saturated with the solution, it was removed and patted dry using Kimwipes®. The damp ACC was then dried, first on the bench top and then under vacuum at room temperature. Finally, the impregnated ACC was reduced with H2 in a Parr pressure reactor (model 452HC) at 500 psi and 220 °C. This catalyst is referred to as 3-IW-NH3, where “3” means 3 wt% of ruthenium, “IW” stands for incipient wetness impregnation and “NH3” means the precursor is Ru(NH3)6Cl3.
2.4. Electrochemical cell setup
Electrochemical hydrogenation of WSBO was carried out in a two-chamber glass H-cell,10 separated with a DuPont® Nafion-117 membrane. Due to resistance heating as current passes through the electrolyte solution, a water jacket was used to cool the cathode chamber (Fig. 1). Reaction temperature was 27 °C and the pressure was 1 atm. The WSBO in 0.2 M NaCl served as the cathode electrolyte (catholyte), while 3-IW-NH3 was used as the working electrode (cathode). Anolyte (30 mL) consisted of 1 M sulfuric acid, and a Pt wire was used as the counter electrode (anode). ECH was carried out under galvanostatic control (480 mA) with an Instek GPR-11H30D DC power supply. Due to the high current and two-chamber cell design, the cathode potential was very low and around −7.5 V relative to a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. A reaction time of 6.5 hours was used for all trials to substantially convert the reducible components present in WSBO.‡ A de-ionized water trap (Fig. 1) was used to capture organic compounds stripped from the catholyte by hydrogen gas. Control experiments using only ACC without Ru were carried out in the same reaction conditions, indicating Ru is an essential component for bio-oil stabilization.

2.5. Product analysis

2.5.1. Pyroprobe-GC/MS. 
Analytical pyrolysis experiments were conducted using a microscale pyrolysis unit, CDS Pyroprobe 5250 (CDS Analytical Inc, Oxford, PA) interfaced to a Shimadzu QP-5050A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Shimadzu Corp, Columbia, MD). Approximately 0.5 mg of ground biomass sample was packed between quartz wool in a quartz tube with a filler rod. Three replicates of each sample were run. The pyroprobe was brought to 600 °C at a heating rate of 1000 °C s−1, with a hold time of 10 s. GC/MS analyses for the vapors from the pyroprobe, and for other ECH samples were run as described above for bio-oil analyses.


2.5.2. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC). 
The molecular weight distribution of the WSBO fraction was determined using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system equipped with a Waters Ultrahydrogel™ 250 7.8 × 300 mm column. A diode array detector (DAD) (260, 280 and 340 nm) and a refractive index detector were used to analyze the phenolic, carbohydrate and miscellaneous oxygenate compounds. The mobile phase was 0.1 M sodium nitrate and 0.01 M sodium hydroxide with a flow rate of 0.6 mL min−1. Column temperature was set at 40 °C for SEC analysis. Samples were diluted two-fold using the mobile phase. Dextran standards were used to identify the molecular weight peaks for the carbohydrates in the bio-oil samples. The molecular weight peaks for phenolic compounds were not calibrated, so the DAD signal provided a qualitative result in which larger molecules elute earlier in time relative to the smaller molecules.


2.5.3. Total organic carbon (TOC). 
The TOC content of the WSBO samples was analyzed in triplicate by a TOC analyzer (O.I. Analytical, Model 1010). Standards with concentrations from 6.25 ppm to 50 ppm were used to quantify the TOC in the samples. As needed, samples were diluted to fit the TOC calibration range.

2.6. Electrochemical efficiency (E.E.)
Hydrogen generation was quantified by water displacement using an inverted graduated cylinder. The E.E. was calculated according to the following equation:E.E. = (I × t − 2 × n × F)/(I × t)
Where I is the current, t is the reaction time, n is the number of moles of hydrogen, and F is the Faraday constant.
2.7. Bio-oil aging
Water-soluble bio-oil (10–20 g) was weighed into a pressure tube. The tube was then capped and placed in an oven at a temperature of 80 °C for 48 h. The aged WSBO was then filtered with a 0.22 μm syringe filter for SEC analysis.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. ECH of water-soluble bio-oil

3.1.1. Characterization before and after ECH. 
Aliquots of WSBO before and after ECH were analyzed using GC/MS. Due to the large number of components, only some larger peaks were quantified. As shown in Table 1, aldehydes and ketones were observed in the WSBO before ECH, including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propanal, acetone, butanal, 2,3-butanedione, 2-butanone, glycolaldehyde, acetol, cyclohexanone and 3-methyl-1,2-cyclopentanedione. After 6.5 h of ECH, most of these compounds were depleted or fully converted. Analysis of the product mixture showed hydrogenation products such as ethanol, 2-propanol, 1-propanol, 2-butanol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, ethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Possible reaction schemes are shown in Fig. 2.

As shown in Table 1, acetic acid decreases by more than 50% during ECH, indicating that bio-oil compatibility with metal surfaces is improved as acetic acid is a major contributor to bio-oil corrosiveness. However, the mild ECH conditions employed are not expected to reduce acetic acid. Instead, migration of acetic acid to the anode chamber through the membrane may be the major contributor to this decrease. This suggests that ECH using a polymer electrolyte membrane cell could be an alternative approach to reduce the carboxylic acids and the corrosiveness of bio-oil.
Several major products formed upon the ECH of WSBO were quantified by GC/MS (Table 2). Besides alcohol production, relatively large amounts of diols, such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, were produced with the total carbon yield of 10%. Other diols or polyols may be produced during ECH, such as 1,2-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol and sorbitol, etc. The yields of diols or polyols can be further improved by optimization of pyrolysis or better feedstock selection. Thus, ECH of WSBO provides a method for producing diols and polyols at very mild conditions.

In addition to hydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones, several other mechanisms may deplete observable bio-oil compounds. Polymerization during ECH could form species undetectable by GC/MS. Migration to the anode chamber by crossing the membrane is a second possible mechanism. Adsorption onto the catalyst or support surface could also reduce the solution-phase concentration of select compounds. As shown in Table 3, control experiments run in the electrochemical cell (Fig. 1) without current did show some reactant depletion, confirming a role for non-electrochemical losses.

Regarding polymerization, no coke formation was observed, but small amounts of solid precipitated in the cathode chamber during ECH. A mass of 8 mg of solid was collected after drying under vacuum (less than 0.1 wt% of the 15 mL WSBO). This solid was analyzed using Py-GC/MS. As shown in Fig. 3, the chromatogram showed a few small peaks for ketones and furans at early retention times, and later, many phenolic compounds. The solid was also dissolved in methanol and analyzed directly by GC/MS, but no peaks were observed. This suggests that the solid was made of phenolic and carbohydrate oligomers or polymers formed during ECH of the WSBO. One explanation could be base catalyzed polymerization due to the fast consumption of protons close to the cathode surface. Notably, substantial acetic acid remains at the end of reaction; perhaps strong stirring could decrease the pH at the catalyst surface and reduce the extent of polymerization.

Peaks identified as: (1) acetone, (2) 2-methylfuran, (3) 2,3-butanedione, (4) 2,5-dimethylfuran, (5) 3-methyl-1,2-cyclopentanone, (6) phenol, (7) guaiacol, (8) 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol, (9) 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol, (10) 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, (11) 2-methoxy-4-propylphenol, (12) syringol, (13) 2-methoxy-4-(1-propenyl)-phenol, (14) 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene, (15) 5-tert-butylpyrogallol, (16) 4-methyl-2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde. 
Precipitate formation during ECH of WSBO suggests the possible presence of still-soluble polymers as well. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used to probe for molecular weight changes in the dissolved organics. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the intensity of the peak around 1400 Da increased after electrocatalytic hydrogenation. Fig. 4(b) also shows a significant increase at 16 min with diode array detection at 260 nm. These findings suggest some polymerization to form carbohydrate and phenolic oligomers even under the mild conditions of ECH. Analogous molecular weight increases have been observed in the catalytic stabilization of bio-oil. Gagnon and Kaliaguine5 showed that the average molecular weight increased from 1775 to 3040 Da during stabilization of bio-oil using CuCr at 120 °C and 1000 psi.

Organic compound migration and adsorption onto the cathode were examined by analyzing the carbon distribution in different parts of the electrochemical cell with a TOC analyzer (Table 4). Control experiments without electricity were first performed to check the carbon distribution. After 6.5 h, 81% of the carbon was retained in the cathode chamber, however, 12% was transferred to the anode chamber due to the organic concentration gradient. The catalytic cathode also adsorbed 4.0% of the carbon. Thus, adsorption onto the catalytic cathode and migration to the anode chamber explain the majority of the mass loss from the cathode compartment (Table 3).

After 6.5 h of ECH, 80% of the carbon was retained in the cathode chamber and 6.0% was found in the anode chamber due to the migration through the membrane. The cathode adsorbed about 2.6% of the carbon and 0.2% was trapped in the downstream water trapping system. Thus, the system's total carbon balance was 88.8%, not counting the solid precipitate formed. Organics trapped in the membrane may be another source for the carbon loss as the membrane turned black after the ECH reaction. Oxidation of the organics at the anode may have removed additional carbon as the carbon content in the anode chamber was lower than that for the no-current control experiments. Small organic compounds such as C1 and C2 acids, aldehydes, and alcohols can migrate through the membrane to the anode side.17–20 These organic compounds may be oxidized to form carbon dioxide in the anode compartment21,22 (high overpotential and 1 M sulfuric acid). Further membrane and electrolyte optimization may slow the transport of small organic compounds to the anode chamber. But even without any improvements, the carbon retention in ECH of WSBO is still better than that in catalytic hydrogenation. For instance, Vispute2 obtained carbon recoveries in the liquid products of only 75% and 64% during low temperature hydrogenation of WSBO at 150 °C and 175 °C.


3.1.2. Stability test. 
With the majority of its carbonyl compounds hydrogenated to more stable alcohols or diols, the WSBO is expected to become less reactive upon ECH treatment. This prediction was confirmed by accelerated aging studies (80 °C for 48 h) of the WSBO before and after treatment by ECH. Size exclusion chromatography was used to analyze the molecular weight distributions. In untreated WSBO, the molecular weight profile of the carbohydrate components, as assessed by the IR detector, did not significantly change after aging (Fig. 5(a)), but that of the lignin-derived compounds, as observed by UV absorption, increased significantly, showing a large peak before 14 min (Fig. 5(b)). This molecular weight increase could be due to reactions of phenol or substituted phenols with aldehydes to form polymers.23
 Fig. 5  Size exclusion chromatographs of water-soluble bio-oil without ECH treatment before and after aging with (a) IR detector and (b) DAD detector (260 nm). 
When ECH-treated WSBO was subjected to the accelerated aging test, SEC analysis showed only slight increases in the molecular weights of both the carbohydrate- and lignin-derived components (Fig. 6). However, unlike the untreated samples, the molecular weight of ECH-treated WSBO did not develop the peak running before 14 min. This indicates that ECH treatment slows bio-oil polymerization, presumably due to hydrogenation of the carbonyl compounds.

Viscosity increases with polymerization, so aging effects on untreated and ECH treated WSBO were examined via viscometry.24 However, since both untreated and ECH-treated samples were significantly diluted with water, no viscosity effects were observed (Fig. S2†). Thus for the aqueous fraction of bio-oil, viscometry was not effective as a probe of polymerization.

3.2. Electrochemical efficiency in the ECH of WSBO
Electrochemical efficiency (E.E.) is important for electrocatalytic hydrogenation of bio-oil as it affects the energy efficiency and thus operating cost. Instead of ECH, some of the current passed may be diverted to hydrogen production, a less valuable side reaction. It should be noted, however, that hydrogen is a readily recovered co-product that has value in downstream upgrading, improving the economics of this process.
Various methods have been used to improve E.E. during ECH of organic compounds.25–29 Amouzegar and Savadogo25 showed that decreasing the Pt catalyst particle size raised E.E. to 70% during ECH of phenol. Temperature, current density, electrolyte and pH also affect electrochemical efficiency.26,27 Of particular interest here is the addition of cationic surfactant, which can strongly enhance efficiency in ECH of unsaturated compounds.28,29 A possible mechanism for this enhancement involves formation of a hydrophobic layer attached to the negatively polarized electrode surface. Solubility in and therefore partitioning into this layer is greater for relatively hydrophobic organic substrates than for H3O+, favoring higher catalyst surface coverage by organics, and therefore their hydrogenation over H2 formation. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), one cationic surfactant, has been shown to improve E.E. during ECH of limonene and carvone.30 In the ECH of WSBO, addition of 2 mM CTAB improved the E.E. by 4% to 10%, as seen in Fig. 7.

3.3. Strategies for system optimization in the ECH of WSBO
Mass and energy balances for ECH of water-soluble bio-oil are shown in the ESI.† Based on those calculations, two energy efficiencies were used to evaluate the ECH system. Energy efficiency 1 (η1) = (E2 − E1)/We; and energy efficiency 2 (η2) = (E2 + E3 − E1)/We, where E1 is the energy content of water-soluble bio-oil (WSBO); E2 is the energy content of the stabilized water-soluble bio-oil (SWSBO); E3 is the energy content of hydrogen generated during ECH; and We is the electrical work input to the ECH system. For the current ECH setup, both energy efficiencies are very low (Table 5). The energy loss is due to solution and membrane resistance, electrode overpotential and WSBO losses. Approaches to improve the energy efficiencies were discussed below.

3.3.1. Improvement of the energy efficiency. 
The use of a solid polymer electrolyte ECH cell could reduce the distance between electrodes and significantly decrease the solution resistance. In such an optimized cell, the voltage required for ECH at practical rates could be reduced, raising energy efficiency. Fig. 8 illustrates the inverse relationship between applied voltage and energy efficiencies. As the voltage decreases to 2 V, the energy efficiencies η1 and η2 increase to 3.1% and 72%, assuming a WSBO loss of 5%. Though energy efficiency 2 (η2) rises quickly with dropping voltage, energy efficiency 1 (η1) is still very low, due to the low electrochemical efficiency of organic reduction and resulting high hydrogen byproduct formation. Further efficiency improvements could be achieved via reductions in WSBO losses to membrane crossing and polymerization of bio-oil components. Decrease of the anode overpotential by using other alternatives, such as RuO2 based anode, could be another good option.
 Fig. 8  Energy efficiency 1 and 2 change with the applied voltage. (Assuming WSBO loss is 5%). 
The findings described above open the door to E.E. optimization by varying CTAB concentration, along with more familiar optimization of the catalysts, and reaction conditions (temperature, pH, electrolyte, current density). Fig. 9 shows how the energy efficiencies η1 and η2 change with the electrochemical efficiency. Both of these energy efficiencies have linear relationships with E.E. As the E.E. increases from 7% to 98%, energy efficiency 1 increases from 3.1% to 45%, while energy efficiency 2 decreases from 72% to 45% due to a decrease in hydrogen production.

3.3.2. Reduction of water use. 
Large amounts of water are used in the scenario described, resulting in high downstream costs for purification and a need for wastewater treatment. In preparation of WSBO, the much smaller water to bio-oil ratio of 1:8 could be used to extract the water-soluble fraction. Fig. 10 shows the material balance for the ECH of water-soluble bio-oil with water to bio-oil ratio of 1:8. Water use can be reduced from 18.19 kg (water to bio-oil ratio, 8.73:1) to 0.90 kg (water to bio-oil ratio, 1:8) per kg of bio-oil. This increase in concentration of organics should not only reduce water separation and disposal costs, but also enhance E.E. by increasing substrate concentrations at catalyst sites.

4. Conclusions
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation can convert most of the aldehydes and ketones in bio-oil to their corresponding alcohols. Accelerated aging studies followed by SEC analysis showed that ECH stabilizes bio-oil against polymerization. Carbon recovery, >80%, into the liquid phase was obtained during ECH of water-soluble bio-oil. A trace of precipitate was observed during electrocatalytic hydrogenation, but much less than that reported from the catalytic hydrogenation of bio-oil. Valuable products, such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, may be recovered after electrocatalytic hydrogenation of water-soluble bio-oil, and even the byproduct hydrogen adds significant value. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation provides a potential method for partially upgrading water-soluble bio-oil into stable fuel intermediates and valuable chemicals.
