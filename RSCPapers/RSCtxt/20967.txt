    , Accepted 18th February 2015First published on 9th March 2015AbstractAs semiconductor-based nanoheterostructures play a decisive role in current electronics and optoelectronics, the introduction of active heterojunctions can afford new and improved capabilities that will enhance the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy. In this work, a novel metal/semiconductor MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterojunction has been designed and prepared to significantly enhance photocatalytic H2 production efficiency. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S for H2 generation from water under visible-light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) is measured. MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S hybrid nanoparticles have a higher photocatalytic activity than Zn0.5Cd0.5S even without the noble metal cocatalyst. The results show that the rate of H2 evolution over annealed MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S is about 13 times higher than that of Zn0.5Cd0.5S alone, and 10 times higher than that of simply mixed MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S. Implying that the strong coupling at the interface of MoO2 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S facilitates electron transfer from the conduction band of Zn0.5Cd0.5S to metallic MoO2, thus promoting the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. MoO2 (2 wt%)/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterostructured photocatalyst calcined at 673 K achieves the optimal overall activity for H2 evolution. The introduction of metallic MoO2 cocatalyst leads to a remarkable improvement in the photo current and photocatalytic H2 production activity of Zn0.5Cd0.5S, and the content of MoO2 in this catalyst has an important influence on the photocatalytic activity. It is shown that 2 wt% metallic MoO2 loaded on Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample produces a maximum photocatalytic H2 production rate of 252.4 μmol h−1. The junctions formed between metallic MoO2 and semiconductor Zn0.5Cd0.5S by calcination play a key role in high photocatalytic water splitting to produce H2. Our study demonstrates that metallic MoO2 is an excellent H2 evolution cocatalyst, and could be used as a cocatalyst for other semiconductors to improve performances.
Introduction
Due to its high energy content and environmental friendliness, hydrogen is regarded as a clean alternative energy. At present, many materials containing H2 are possible sources, for example fossil fuels, biomass, or even water. However, large amounts of greenhouse gases such as CO2 are generated in processes such as petroleum hydrocarbon cracking. Water splitting to produce H2 does not generate unwanted gases but it does have the crucial requirement that energy be supplied from an external source. Provided that this energy comes from a renewable source such as solar energy, H2 as a green energy could replace all current power sources.1,2 Since the Honda–Fujishima water splitting work on TiO2 electrode was reported in 1972,3 great effort has focused on the development of highly efficient semiconductor photocatalysts for H2 production. So far, a large number of semiconductor photocatalysts have been investigated such as sulfides,4 nitrides,5 and metal oxides.6,7 Nevertheless, there is still a big challenge due to the low efficiency and high cost.
As a means to overcome the above challenges, metal sulfides have been developed as a promising visible-light-driven photocatalyst. Cadmium sulfide (CdS) with a bandgap of 2.4 eV which matches well with the visible spectral range of solar light, exhibits good photocatalytic activity due to its highly effective absorption of solar energy. However, the relatively low activity and robustness are critical problems and restrict its practical application.8,9 An effective way to enhance the activity and photostability is to combine CdS with other metal sulfides to make a solid solution such as ZnxCd1−xS.10 ZnxCd1−xS ternary metal sulfides exhibit significantly higher photostability than pure CdS because the band gap formed between ZnS and CdS can be adjusted with x, and its photocatalytic properties can be modified to meet the requirements of the photocatalytic H2 production.11 What is more, surface modification of photocatalysts with cocatalysts is also crucial for enhancing photocatalytic H2 production reactions.12 Cocatalysts loaded on semiconductor photocatalysts could promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, cocatalysts afford the low activation potentials for O2 or H2 evolution and often serve as the active sites for O2 or H2 generation.13 Therefore, the loading of proper cocatalysts can greatly enhance the activity of photocatalysts. So far, in most works, noble metals or their oxides have been proven to be effective cocatalysts for water splitting. However, expanding the application of Pt-based catalysts is still very difficult because Pt is rare and expensive. It is therefore highly desirable to develop new active, stable, and less expensive alternative cocatalysts. For example, MoS2 has been widely used as a cocatalyst due to its impressive catalytic activities and its robustness.14,15
Metallic phase MoO2 with a distorted rutile structure displays metallic electrical conductivity, high melting-point, and good chemical resistance. It has broad applications in catalysis, sensors, electrochromism, solid lubricants, field mission devices, and supercapacitors because of its charge transport performance. It is noted that MoO2 has distinctive metallic electrical conductivity, which is not a general nature of metal oxides. This is largely due to its relatively high density of states of the Mo 4d, 5s free electrons localized on Mo in the valence band energy region. The presence of these free electrons is supposed to enhance the catalytic activity of the Mo4+ in MoO2, in contrast to Mo6+ in MoO3 where all the valence electrons of Mo are bonded to neighbouring oxygen atoms.16–19
Herein we report the first example of metallic MoO2 as a cocatalyst loaded on Zn0.5Cd0.5S solid solution for enhancing photocatalytic H2 production under visible light. It is revealed that the activity of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanoparticles (NPs) can be enormously increased by loading metallic MoO2 cocatalyst. First, a simple method is developed to fabricate metallic MoO2 NPs by reducing MoO3 with Mo under hydrothermal conditions. Then, MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterojunction is prepared by annealing simply mixed MoO2 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S at different temperatures, and photocatalytic H2 production is measured under visible light illumination. The charge transfer mechanism is also proposed.
Experimental section
Preparation of MoO2
Commercial MoO3 (1 mmol) and Mo powder (0.5 mmol) were dispersed in 20 mL double distilled water. NH4Cl (100 mg) was added to the mixture and then stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The mixture was subsequently transferred into a 25 mL-capacity Teflon-lined autoclave which was heated to 200 °C and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the black powder was obtained by centrifugation, washed several times with distilled water and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C overnight in a vacuum oven.
Preparation of MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S
3 mmol of cadmium acetate (Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O), 3 mmol of zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) and a certain amount of prepared MoO2 were added in 50 mL of distilled water. The pH value of the aqueous solution was adjusted to 7.3 using 0.2 M NaOH aqueous solution. After stirring for several minutes, 9 mmol Na2S dispersed in 30 mL distilled water was added dropwise into the above suspension with stirring for 20 min. The precipitation liquor was stirred continuously for 18 h at room temperature. The resulting powders were collected by filtration and washed with water and absolute ethanol several times. The powders were dried at 60 °C under vacuum. Finally, the samples were calcined at 573 K, 673 K and 773 K, respectively, for 2 h in nitrogen at a heating rate of 5 °C per minute. MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterostructured samples with different mass ratios ranging from 1 wt% to 3 wt% were prepared following the sample procedure.
Characterization
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared photocatalysts were obtained by a Rigaku diffactometer (MXPAHF, Japan) with Cu irradiation (λ = 0.1540 nm). The specimens of transmission electron microscopic images (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopic images (HRTEM) were performed on a JEOL-2010 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a Shimadzu UV-2510 spectrophotometer in the region of 300 to 800 nm. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were operated using the Photoemission Endstation in the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL, Hefei, P. R. China). Nitrogen adsorption measurements were obtained at 77 K with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system using Barrett–Emmett–Teller (BET) calculations for the surface area.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode quartz cell with 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. Platinum wire was used as counter and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrodes, and Zn0.5Cd0.5S, MoO2 (2 wt%)/Zn0.5Cd0.5S film electrodes on Ti foil served as the working electrode which were prepared by depositing suspensions (the concentration of sample dispersed by absolute ethanol is 10 mg mL−1) onto Ti foil using the doctor-blade coating method with a glass rod and scotch tape as a frame and spacer, respectively. The electrodes were annealed at 90 °C for 12 h. During measurements, the electrodes were pressed against a □-shape of an electrochemical cell with a working area of 4.0 cm2. Photoelectrochemical test systems were composed of a CHI 660B electrochemistry potentiostat (Shanghai Chenhua Limited, China).
Photocatalytic reactions
Photocatalytic reactions of H2 production from water were conducted in a gas-closed circulation system and irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm). The photocatalyst powder (0.1 g) was ultrasonically dispersed for 15 min in an aqueous solution (100 mL) containing 0.1 M Na2S and 0.1 M Na2SO3 in a 500 mL Pyrex glass reactor. The amount of H2 evolved was determined using an on-line gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector and nitrogen as the carrier gas. The activities of photocatalysts were compared using the average H2 evolution rate in the first 5 hours.
Results and discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared black MoO2 (Fig. S1† and inset photograph in Fig. 1a) are shown in Fig. 1a. The result shows that the diffraction peaks of the XRD patterns can be readily indexed to the pure rutile phase [space group: P42/mnm (no. 136)] of MoO2 crystal (JCPDS no. 02-0422),18 and no other peaks were observed for impurities such as Mo and MoO3 as well as other molybdenum oxides, indicating the high purity of the obtained MoO2 when the molar ratio of Mo powder to MoO3 was 0.5. As the molar ratio of Mo/MoO3 increased to 0.55, the main product is also MoO2 as clearly observed from Fig. 1a, whereas a small amount of Mo appears, indicating that used Mo powder is excess. The result shows that MoO3 can be reduced to MoO2 by Mo powder under hydrothermal conditions, as seen in eqn (1). Mo + 2MoO3 → 3MoO2(1)

Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of as-prepared MoO2 (2 wt%)/Zn0.5Cd0.5S photocatalyst and the corresponding sample calcined at 673 K. The diffraction peaks of simple mixed MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample without calcination display three prominent diffraction peaks at 28.1°, 46.08°, and 54.11°, corresponding to (111), (220) and (311) planes, respectively, well matching the standard peaks of cubic zinc blende phase. The diffraction peaks of calcined MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample demonstrate that Zn0.5Cd0.5S transformed from the cubic phase to hexagonal phase, as clearly shown in Fig. 1b. In addition, the XRD patterns recorded from the heterostructured sample show that the diffraction peaks of MoO2 were not detected likely due to the very low content (2 wt%) in composites.
MoO2 (2 wt%)/Zn0.5Cd0.5S hybrid sample calcined at 673 K was further characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). As shown in Fig. 2a, it can be seen that the sample consists of irregular NPs with an average size of 90 nm. The HRTEM image presented in Fig. 2b clearly demonstrates the formation of heterojunctions between MoO2 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S as indicated by red arrows. The lattice fringes of d = 0.17 nm match that of the (220) crystallographic planes of MoO2,20 while the fringes with a lattice spacing of d = 0.33 nm are close to the lattice spacing of the wurtzite CdS (002) plane.21 The result shows that heterojunctions between MoO2 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S were successfully obtained when MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S photocatalyst was treated at 673 K, which is favorable for enhancing the charge separation and thus the photocatalytic activity.

Fig. 3 shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S with different amounts of MoO2 loadings. Compared with Zn0.5Cd0.5S solid solution, the obtained MoO2 (2 wt%)/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composites display a significant increase in light absorption in the visible-light region with increasing MoO2 content. This red shift can be attributed to the presence of black MoO2 in the composites. The change trend is in accordance with the color changing from orange to dark green with increasing content of black MoO2 loadings (inset photograph in Fig. 3). Plots of (αhν)1/2versus photon energy (hν)22,23 are shown in Fig. 3b. It can be seen that Zn0.5Cd0.5S solid solution can absorb visible light with wavelengths of about 475 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 2.61 eV.

The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S calcined at 573, 673 and 773 K are given in Fig. S2.† A small increase in the absorption at wavelengths shorter than 500 nm can be assigned to the intrinsic band gap absorption of Zn0.5Cd0.5S. A small red shift of absorbance of MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composites with increasing calcination temperature is probably ascribed to two factors. One is that the increase of crystalline size and surface roughness can cause the red shift of light absorption. The other is that the part phase transformation from cubic to hexagonal leads to a decrease of band gap.
Important information on the surface electronic state and the composition of the final products was further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Fig. 4). Fig. 4a displays the representative XPS survey scan spectrum of annealed MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite sample, clearly indicating the existence of Zn, Cd, S, Mo and O elements. The peak appearing at 1021.8 eV in Fig. 4b corresponds to the Zn 2p3/2 level. The high resolution Cd 3d spectrum shows two sharp peaks located at 411.6 and 404.9 eV, corresponding to the spin–orbit split components (Fig. 4c). The S 2p peak in Fig. 4d shows that the core-level spectrum at 161.7 eV is indicative of the presence of sulfur ions. The S 2p3 and Cd 3d peaks can be ascribed to the Cd–S bonds.12,24 Moreover, the binding energy values for Zn 2p3/2 and S 2p3 are consistent with the reported data.25,26 The high-resolution Mo 3d spectrum of the MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S hybrid is shown in Fig. 4e. The peaks at 229.3 and 232.4 eV can be ascribed to Mo(IV) 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, with a spin energy separation of 3.2 eV. This characteristic doublet of core-level Mo 3d5/2, 3/2 indicates the Mo(IV) oxidation state of MoO2.27 In addition, two weak peaks centered at 231.5 eV and at 235.6 eV could be ascribed to Mo(VI) 3d5/2 and d3/2 of MoO3, respectively, this results from the mild surface oxidation of MoO2 upon exposure to air.28 The O 1s peak is attributed to O 1s in the Mo–O linkages of MoO2,29 as displayed in Fig. 4f.

To investigate the chemical change of elements before and after loading of MoO2 by calcination, XPS analysis of Zn0.5Cd0.5S and MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S was provided for comparison (Fig. S3†). The positions of Zn 2p3/2, Cd 3d and S 2p are downshifted by about 0.4 eV, 0.3 eV, 0.2 eV, respectively, as compared to those of the pristine Zn0.5Cd0.5S, indicating charge transfer from Zn0.5Cd0.5S to MoO2 occurs, as demonstrated in previous work.30,31
Heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction is a surface-based process, and the large surface area helps to enhance photocatalytic activity due to more surface active sites for the adsorption of reactant molecules.32,33Fig. 5a shows nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution curve. The isotherms can be categorized as type Ш and hysteresis loops of type H3 in the P/P0 range of 0.8–1.0, indicating the formation of mesopores and macropores.34 In fact, the mesopores are derived from the aggregation of NPs during calcination. The specific surface area of MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S is determined to be 21 m2 g−1, indicating the presence of slit-like pores due to the aggregation of MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S NPs. The pore-size distribution curve (Fig. 5b) of the sample is very broad, further confirming the presence of mesopores.35 The BET surface area and pore volume of the samples calcined at different temperatures are displayed in Table S1 (ESI†).

The calcination temperature of MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S catalysts could influence the surface area, crystallinity of MoO2 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S, and the junctions formed between Zn0.5Cd0.5S and MoO2, thereby affecting the photocatalytic properties. Hence, MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S photocatalysts prepared at different temperatures were tested to investigate the influence of the annealing temperature on the photocatalytic activities of the hybrid photocatalysts. Fig. 6 shows that photocatalytic H2 evolution over MoO2 (2 wt%)/Zn0.5Cd0.5S photocatalysts prepared at different temperatures from 573 to 773 K was systematically measured in an aqueous solution containing SO3−2 and S−2 ions as sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm). Photocatalytic H2 evolution is found to occur on a simply mixed MoO2 (2 wt%)/Zn0.5Cd0.5S catalyst with an average rate of 25.6 μmol h−1. After annealing at different temperatures, the activity of MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S was dramatically enhanced. The rate of H2 evolution on MoO2 (2 wt%)/Zn0.5Cd0.5S increased from 130.3 to 252.4 μmol h−1 with increasing temperature from 573 to 673 K, and a maximum value was achieved at a heating temperature of 673 K, which is about 10 times higher than that of simply mixed MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S catalyst without thermal treatment. This can be explained by the formation of heterojunctions for efficient charge carrier transfer and separation, high crystallinity for decreasing photogenerated e/h recombination.13,36 Further increase of the annealing temperature to 773 K reduced the rate of H2 evolution to 184.4 μmol h−1 for MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S catalyst, which could be ascribed to the drastic decrease of the surface area of catalyst calcined at higher temperature. It is noted that H2 evolution rate of MoO2 (2 wt%)/Zn0.5Cd0.5S hybrid photocatalyst is higher than Pt (0.5 wt%)/Zn0.5Cd0.5S (144 μmol h−1) under visible light irradiation (see Fig. S4†). This distinct property of metallic MoO2 makes it an alternative to noble metals such as Pt.

Reaction conditions: catalyst, 0.1 g; 100 mL aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Na2S and 0.1 M Na2SO3, and the light source is a 300 W xenon lamp (λ ≥ 420 nm). 
H2 evolution rates of MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S hybrid photocatalysts with different amounts of MoO2 loadings are presented in Fig. 7, together with that of Zn0.5Cd0.5S for comparison. The introduction of metallic MoO2 cocatalyst indeed leads to a remarkable improvement in the photocatalytic H2 production activity of Zn0.5Cd0.5S, and the content of MoO2 in hybrid catalyst has an important influence on the photocatalytic activity. No obvious H2 evolution was detected when MoO2 alone was used as the catalyst, implying that MoO2 itself is not active for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Zn0.5Cd0.5S alone shows activity in photocatalytic H2 evolution, but the H2 evolution rate is only 19.2 μmol h−1, suggesting that Zn0.5Cd0.5S is short of catalytic active sites for H2 evolution because of the rapid recombination between conduction band (CB) electrons and valence band (VB) holes, and the presence of a large overpotential in the production of H2. However, in the presence of a small amount of metallic MoO2 such as 1 wt% in the hybrid photocatalyst, the H2 production activity increased by up to nearly 8 times compared to Zn0.5Cd0.5S. With the amount of MoO2 loaded on Zn0.5Cd0.5S increasing, H2 evolution rate of MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S further increased and achieved a maximum when the loading amount of MoO2 on Zn0.5Cd0.5S reached about 2 wt%. The rate of H2 evolution is 252.4 μmol h−1, which increased by up to 13 times compared with Zn0.5Cd0.5S alone. Further increasing the MoO2 content in the hybrid photocatalyst leading to a gradual reduction of the photocatalytic activity as clearly shown in Fig. 7. The reasons that photocatalytic activities decrease when the loaded MoO2 is more than a certain amount is likely due to the following several aspects: (i) with the increase of the amount of black MoO2, the color of the samples is becoming much deeper ranging from orange to dark-green. The introduction of a large percentage of black MoO2 can lead to a significant increase in the opacity and shield the incident light from irradiating the photocatalyst, which reduces the light absorption of Zn0.5Cd0.5S;12,36,37 (ii) the active sites on the surface of Zn0.5Cd0.5S are likely to be blocked by excess MoO2 cocatalyst, which hinders the effective contact of the active sites and the reactants. Therefore, it is important to optimize the photocatalytic activity of the hybrid photocatalyst by loading appropriate amounts of metallic MoO2 cocatalyst.

Reaction conditions: catalyst, 0.1 g; 100 mL aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Na2S and 0.1 M Na2SO3, calcination temperature: 673 K and the light source is a 300 W xenon lamp (λ ≥ 420 nm). 
The recycling performance and durability of photocatalysts is of significance from the viewpoint of the widespread photocatalytic applications. To evaluate the stability and recycling performance of the prepared hybrid composites, the cycling tests of the photocatalytic H2 evolution from aqueous solutions were measured by using the same catalyst repeatedly four times under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm). As displayed in Fig. 8, after four consecutive operations, the catalyst does not exhibit any noticeable loss of photocatalytic activity, indicating the excellent stability of MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S during photocatalytic H2 production after 20 h illumination.

In order to prove the structure stability of MoO2 on the surface of Zn0.5Cd0.5S, we have compared Mo 3d XPS spectra of MoO2 (2 wt%)/Zn0.5Cd0.5S before and after photocatalytic reactions (Fig. S5, Table S2, ESI†). Fig. S5 shows that only a small fraction of Mo4+ (2.1%) was oxidized to Mo6+ after four consecutive operations, indicating good stability of MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S during photocatalytic H2 production. The XRD pattern of used sample (Fig. S6†) demonstrates that the crystal structure does not change, well matching the standard peaks of Zn0.5Cd0.5S hexagonal phase. These results are in agreement with the cycling tests in water splitting (Fig. 8).
The photocurrent response experiments were measured on a photoelectrochemical test device fabricated by drop casting Zn0.5Cd0.5S and MoO2 (2 wt%)/Zn0.5Cd0.5S dispersed alcohol solution onto Ti foils (see the Experimental section). The initial current is due largely to the separation of electron hole pairs at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. The decrease of the photocurrent implies that a fraction of the holes either recombine with electrons from the conduction band and/or accumulate at the surface. It is found that the current of MoO2 (2 wt%)/Zn0.5Cd0.5S (Fig. 9b) can rapidly decreases to zero as long as the light is turned off, and the photocurrent remained a constant value when the light turned on. While Zn0.5Cd0.5S alone (Fig. 9a) exhibits a moderate photocurrent, lower than MoO2 (2 wt%)/Zn0.5Cd0.5S. Higher photocurrent observed for the MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterojunction is attributed to the fact that the photogenerated electrons and holes in Zn0.5Cd0.5S prefer to separately transfer to metallic MoO2, and the radiative recombination of e/h pairs is hampered, which is in agreement with the higher photocatalytic activity in water splitting.

As mentioned above, for the obtained nanocomposites, Zn0.5Cd0.5S solid solution is the leading active component for photocatalytic H2 evolution, and metallic MoO2 cocatalyst acts as an electron collector and transporter. The strong interface coupling interaction between MoO2 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S supports the vectorial transfer of the photo-generated electrons from the conduction band (CB) of Zn0.5Cd0.5S to metallic MoO2, as shown in Scheme 1. The work function of MoO2 was reported to be 5.36 eV,19 Zn0.5Cd0.5S semiconductor has the conducting band ca. 1.67 eV and a band gap of about 2.61 eV. The conducting band of Zn0.5Cd0.5S is smaller than the work function of MoO2, such that the photogenerated electrons transfer from Zn0.5Cd0.5S to MoO2 is energetically favorable. It is believed that the spatial charge separation of the photo-generated electrons and holes is favorable for forestalling the electron and hole recombination, which in turn leads to high photocatalytic activity. This possible mechanism can be further confirmed by transient photocurrent experiments (Fig. 9). Pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S shows a very low photocurrent because of the rapid recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes. After adding MoO2 cocatalyst, the photocurrent is significantly enhanced, indicating that the recombination of electron hole pairs is delayed. MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S composite shows the higher photocurrent, implying the improved charge transfer from Zn0.5Cd0.5S to MoO2.

The superior photocatalytic performance of MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S heterojunctions can be attributed to the following reasons. A schottky heterojunction is formed between metallic MoO2 and semiconductor Zn0.5Cd0.5S. Under visible light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of Zn0.5Cd0.5S NPs rapidly transfer to metallic MoO2 NPs. Electrons captured by H+ on the surface of MoO2 accomplish the reduction process, resulting in the efficient evolution of H2. It was reported that metallic MoO2 has a high work function,19 thus facilitating the proton reduction reaction to H2. The photogenerated holes can be trapped by sacrificial reagents undergoing the oxidation process, which oxidizes SO32− to SO42−. Fast electron transfer from Zn0.5Cd0.5S to metallic MoO2 with high conductivity leads to efficient spatial charge separation, thus increasing the yield and lifetime of charge carriers, as well as reducing the recombination of electrons and holes. As a result, the photocatalytic efficiency is significantly enhanced.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the photocatalytic activity of MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanocomposites under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) can be dramatically improved by introducing metallic MoO2 as a cocatalyst to form a novel photocatalyst for H2 evolution. The optimal weight percentage of MoO2 is found to be 2 wt% in the hybrid photocatalyst, resulting in a high photocatalytic H2 production rate of 252.4 μmol h−1, which is 13 times higher than that of Zn0.5Cd0.5S under the same experimental conditions. The formation of heterojunction between MoO2 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S by calcination supports the electron transfer from Zn0.5Cd0.5S to MoO2 and inhibits the photogenerated electron–hole recombination via spatial charge separation. The distinct properties of metallic MoO2 make it an alternative for noble metals such as Pt, leading to the significant enhancement of photocatalytic H2 production. Notably, MoO2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S photocatalyst does not show obvious deactivation for H2 production for longer than 20 h, implying that MoO2 cocatalyst can protect Zn0.5Cd0.5S against photocorrosion. Our results prove that metallic MoO2 NPs with low cost, easy preparation and environmental friendliness will find potential as a high-efficiency cocatalyst for other photocatalytic systems with improved performance.
