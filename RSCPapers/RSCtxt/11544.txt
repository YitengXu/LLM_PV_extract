A combination of Raman spectroscopy, XPS and XAFS analyses had provided solid evidences supporting the substitutional doping of Fe3+ and F− for Ni3+ and OH−, respectively, in NiOOH. Benefiting from the improved intrinsic activity and hierarchical nanostructure, the Ni1−xFexO(OH)1−yFy/NiO/NF catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance for the alkaline OER.

The outstanding performance of this noble-metal-free OER catalyst makes it promising for water-splitting application.
Introduction
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of vital importance for many energy conversion and storage technologies, such as water splitting and secondary metal–air batteries.1–3 The OER is a four-electron process involving multiple reaction intermediates (*OH, *O, and *OOH). Due primarily to the scaling relation between these intermediates, the OER typically requires high overpotentials to reach current densities of interest.4,5
The past decades had witnessed significant progresses in developing earth-abundant OER electrocatalysts. It was found that a number of non-precious metal (Ni, Co, and Fe) compounds, such as oxides,6–8 hydroxides,9–11 nitrides,12–14 phosphides,15–17 sulfides,18–20 and borides,21,22 possess high and stable OER activities in alkaline media, even surpassing precious metal-based catalysts. It has been well established that non-precious metal compounds would transform into catalytically active oxyhydroxides on the catalyst surface under OER conditions, regardless of material type.23–25 Coupled experimental and theoretical studies further suggested that the high-valence metal cations in oxyhydroxides act as active sites for the OER and the best catalyst binds the intermediates neither too strongly nor too weakly, following Sabatier's principle.26,27 In accordance with these mechanistic insights, modulation of surface electronic properties within the constraint of the oxyhydroxide phase had become a major strategy to boost OER activity. In practice, this modification strategy was extensively implemented via cation-doping. This had given rise to a number of bimetallic and polymetallic catalysts that exhibited significantly improved OER activities compared to the monometallic counterparts.28 But on the other hand, it was noted that the choice of metal dopants is limited as many metal dopants may precipitate from oxyhydroxide phases under the OER conditions.
Recently, anion-doping also gained considerable attention as a potential approach for boosting OER activity of earth-abundant catalysts.29,30 But the research in this direction is still in its infancy. According to open literature, the presence of N, P or S elements in the catalysts could help to improve the OER activity, but no solid evidence had been presented to support their incorporation into the catalytically active oxyhydroxide lattice.23,31–34 Among the nonmetallic elements of interest, fluorine (F) appears unique in terms of its status and function in OER catalysts. In our recent study of a F–NiOOH system, we obtained experimental and computational results supporting the F− substitution of OH− in the NiOOH surface layer.35 Furthermore, our study and those by others demonstrated that substitutional F-doping resulted in significant improvement of OER activity.35–37 This finding not only demonstrated the feasibility of improving OER activity from the anion side, but also provided an opportunity for anion–cation co-doping. In comparison with cation-doping, anion–cation co-doping may provide a greater degree of freedom to successfully engineer the surface properties of OER electrocatalysts.
Herein, we report a facile synthesis of an (Fe, F) co-doped NiOOH catalyst and its outstanding OER performance in alkaline electrolyte. Our study found that anodic electrooxidation of Ni foam (NF)-supported NiO nanosheets in an electrolyte containing KF and FeSO4 resulted in the formation of an (Fe, F) co-doped NiOOH surface layer. The thus-fabricated Ni1−xFexO(OH)1−yFy/NiO/NF exhibited outstanding OER activity and excellent stability in an alkaline electrolyte, outperforming most existing OER catalysts. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental work demonstrating the pronounced effect of anion–cation co-doping in the oxyhydroxide phase on the OER performance.
Results and discussion
In the present work, we fabricated an (Fe, F) co-doped NiOOH catalyst via three consecutive steps, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. Here the selection of NiOOH as a basic material is due primarily to its better OER activity than its Co and Fe counterparts.38,39 First, a nanostructured Ni(OH)2 precursor was grown on NF by a hydrothermal process. The resultant sample was then annealed at an elevated temperature to induce the thermal dehydration process of Ni(OH)2, aiming at creating hierarchically nanoporous architecture with a higher specific surface area. Finally, the sample was subjected to anodic electrooxidation in an electrolyte containing F− and Fe2+ to obtain the target catalyst. The control experiments found that current density, reaction time, and KF and FeSO4 concentrations in the electrooxidation operation were all parameters influencing the OER activity of the target catalyst (Fig. S1, ESI†). In the present work, we selected the best-performing catalyst that was synthesized under optimal conditions for detailed investigations.

The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image of the hydrothermal sample (Fig. 1b) clearly showed that the NF surface was densely covered by large amounts of two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets around 10 nm in thickness, which were randomly interconnected to form a three-dimensional (3D) porous architecture. Based on the parallel X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. 2a), these nanosheets were unambiguously identified as crystalline β-Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS #14-0117). The subsequent calcination treatment led to a complete phase transformation from β-Ni(OH)2 into the NiO phase. This was evidenced by the XRD results (Fig. 2a) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. S2, ESI†). The phase transformation induced by the dehydration of Ni(OH)2 caused no significant change in nanosheet morphology, but resulted in the formation of a large number of nanopores, 2 to 4 nm in size, on the nanosheets (Fig. 1b–e). Consistently, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm measurements (Fig. S3, ESI†) revealed that a pore size distribution peak centered at ∼2.3 nm appeared in the calcined sample and the specific surface area increased from 19.7 to 104.3 m2 g−1. Clearly, a favorable combination of nanosheet morphology and nanoporous architecture of the NiO precursor could help to increase the active surface area, hence boosting the OER activity of the target catalyst (Fig. S4, ESI†).

After anodic electrooxidation in the electrolyte containing KF and FeSO4 additives, the sample well retained its morphological features (Fig. 1f). Phase structure analyses of the electro-oxidized sample by XRD (Fig. 2a) and SAED (Fig. 1g, inset) also could not detect any newly formed crystalline phase, except for reduced intensity of NiO peaks compared to those in the calcined sample. In line with these results, the lattice fringes corresponding to the (200) plane of NiO were clearly identified in the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the electro-oxidized sample (Fig. 1h). Importantly, HRTEM observation also revealed the presence of a continuous amorphous layer with a thickness of 2–3 nm on the edge of NiO nanosheets. In an effort to ascertain the nature of this amorphous surface layer, we first examined the sample in high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) mode in conjunction with EDS elemental analysis. The results presented in Fig. 1i and j manifested the incorporation of Fe and F elements into the sample, both of which were uniformly dispersed on the Ni-based substrate. Next, we further obtained compositional and structural information of the amorphous layer from Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) analyses of the target catalyst and relevant reference samples. Fig. 2b presents the Raman spectra of the electro-oxidized samples under different conditions. After anodic electrooxidation in an alkaline electrolyte, the NiO/NF sample showed the characteristic Ni(III)–O bands of NiOOH at 476 and 547 cm−1, respectively. Similarly, the electro-oxidized Fe foam in an alkaline electrolyte exhibited the characteristic Fe–O vibrations of FeOOH at 511 and 672 cm−1, respectively. For the target catalyst that was electro-oxidized in the electrolyte containing KF and FeSO4, the Raman bands appeared at 490 and 560 cm−1, falling between those of NiOOH and FeOOH. These results suggest Fe-doping in NiOOH.8,40,41 In line with the Raman results, the Ni 2p and Fe 2p core-level spectra of the target catalyst clearly showed the high-valence Ni(III) and Fe(III) signals (Fig. 3a and b). Besides, the XPS analysis also provided evidence supporting F-doping in NiOOH. As seen in Fig. 3c, the F 1s core-level spectra manifested the presence of F anions on the catalyst surface. A careful comparison of the high-resolution Ni 2p and Fe 2p spectra found that the binding energies of Ni(III) and Fe(III) in the F-containing sample were positively shifted compared to those in the F-free sample. The enhanced electron donation of high-valance Ni and Fe cations suggested that the highly electronegative F atom had been incorporated into oxyhydroxide. These results collectively manifested the formation of an (Fe, F) co-doped NiOOH layer with a disordered amorphous structure on the catalyst surface under the applied electrochemical oxidation conditions. By using the surface-sensitive XPS technique, we further conducted a depth profile analysis of the target catalyst. As shown in Fig. 3d–f, the signal intensity of Ni3+ relative to Ni2+ gradually decreased with the increasing Ar+ sputtering time, and meanwhile, a similar trend was also observed for Fe3+ and F− signals. After argon etching for 20 s, the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio and Fe3+, F− signals became largely stable. Based on the sputter yield data and the applied etching parameters, the thickness of the (Fe, F) co-doped NiOOH layer was estimated to be about 2 nm.42 This was consistent with the HRTEM-observed thickness of the amorphous layer on the sample surface.

Strong evidences supporting the (Fe, F) co-doping in NiOOH were further obtained from X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended synchrotron X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements. To exclude the influence of the NF substrate on X-ray adsorption fine structure analysis, we deliberately fabricated the samples using carbon cloth as the substrate. Fig. 4a shows the Ni K-edge XANES spectra of the target catalyst and F–NiOOH/NiO and NiOOH/NiO reference samples. It was observed that the Ni absorption edges of the F-doped samples shifted to higher energies than that in the NiOOH/NiO sample. A similar trend was also observed in the Fe K-edge spectra (Fig. 4c). These results were a clear indication of increased oxidation states of Ni and Fe in the F-doped samples, which were in good agreement with the XPS results. The chemical bonding of the samples was analyzed using Fourier transform (FT) k3-weighted EXAFS spectra. As shown in Fig. 4b and Table S1 in the ESI,† the determined Ni–O bond lengths in the two F-doped samples were around 2.00 Å, which were shorter than that in the F-free sample (2.05 Å). Simply from the perspective of bond length change, this phenomenon could be accounted for by the substitution of O2− (1.38 Å) or OH− (1.35 Å) by the smaller F− (1.31 Å). But the aliovalent substitution of F− for O2− would commonly result in a decreased oxidation state of Ni, which was contrary to the experimental observation. A combined analysis of bond length and chemical state changes allowed us to safely conclude that F− substitutes the OH− in NiOOH. According to the quantitative Fe K-edge EXAFS fitting, the nearest metal–metal distance (2.96 Å) in the Fe-doped sample was significantly shorter than the Fe–Fe distance (3.04 Å) in FeOOH and prospectively close to the Ni–Ni distance in NiOOH/NiO (2.93 Å) (Fig. 4d, Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI†). These results demonstrated that Fe substitutes Ni in NiOOH.43 In addition, the low Fe–O and Fe–Ni coordination numbers indicated that the Fe substitution sites were mainly located at the surface or edge of NiOOH.

The OER activities of Ni1−xFexO(OH)1−yFy/NiO/NF and the reference samples were tested and compared in an O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution using a standard three-electrode system. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, Ni1−xFexOOH/NiO/NF and NiO(OH)1−yFy/NiO/NF catalysts exhibited higher OER activities than NiOOH/NiO/NF and the benchmark RuO2/NF, particularly at a higher current density. In comparison with the Fe-doped and F-doped samples, the (Fe, F) co-doped sample exhibited a more pronounced activity enhancement, highlighting the synergistic effect of cation–anion co-doping. Ni1−xFexO(OH)1−yFy/NiO/NF requires a low overpotential of only 186 mV to afford 10 mA cm−2, which is among the best results for alkaline OER catalysts (Table S3, ESI†). In addition, it was noticed that the oxidation wave corresponding to the Ni2+ → Ni3+ transformation was invisible in the Fe-containing samples, suggesting a high Fe-doping level.38,44 This is consistent with the result from XPS surface analysis, which determined a Fe/Ni/F molar ratio of around 1:4:1 for the optimal catalyst. The activity advantage of Ni1−xFexO(OH)1−yFy/NiO/NF over the reference samples was also manifested by the Tafel plots (Fig. 5c). Ni1−xFexO(OH)1−yFy/NiO/NF showed a Tafel slope of 32 mV dec−1, which was much smaller than that of Ni1−xFexOOH/NiO/NF (55 mV dec−1), NiO(OH)1−yFy/NiO/NF (68 mV dec−1), RuO2/NF (70 mV dec−1) and NiOOH/NiO/NF (75 mV dec−1). To better understand the outstanding activity of the (Fe, F) co-doped sample and in particular its advantage over the relevant samples, we measured their double-layer capacitances (CDL) using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method and charge transfer resistance (Rct) using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. As shown in Fig. 5d and e, all examined catalysts had small and similar Rct values and their CDL values were also quite close. This is not unexpected considering their similarity in morphology, microstructure and phase structure. Now that the catalysts had similar electrochemically active surface area and electrical conductivity, their difference in OER performance should stem from the change in intrinsic activity. According to a previous study by Bell et al.,43 incorporation of Fe cations into γ-NiOOH could dramatically change the chemical bonding of Fe, Ni surface sites with the intermediates involved in the OER, resulting in variation of the relative stability of O* with respect to OH* and OOH*. In our preliminary study of a F–NiOOH system,35 theoretical computation results indicated that F substitution of the surface OH group in NiOOH leads to increased electron donation of the adjacent Ni cations to F. As a consequence of the altered surface electronic properties, the adsorption of OH on the surface Ni site became stronger, making its deprotonation (*OH → *O) as the potential-limiting step. Whereas for pure NiOOH, the adsorption of OH on the Ni site (* → *OH) is the potential-limiting step with a higher free energy change. For the (Fe, F) co-doped NiOOH catalyst, detailed theoretical studies are still required to gain insight into the nature of active sites and the mechanism rationalizing the synergistic effect of Fe cations and F anions on OER activity.

The durability of the Ni1−xFexO(OH)1−yFy/NiO/NF catalyst was tested using a chronopotentiometry method in a F-containing electrolyte. Here, the intentional addition of KF in the electrolyte is to solve the F-leaching problem of the F-doped catalyst under the OER condition (Fig. S5, ESI†). As seen in Fig. 5f and S6 in the ESI,† Ni1−xFexO(OH)1−yFy/NiO/NF exhibited exceptionally high stability in the long-term OER operation. It showed a negligible potential variation in a constant-current measurement at 10 mA cm−2 for 100 h. Even at a higher current density of 500 mA cm−2, the catalyst showed a potential fluctuation of only ± 15 mV over 100 h of testing and the post-use catalyst exhibited a slight activity decay compared to its original level. Examination of the post-use Ni1−xFexO(OH)1−yFy/NiO/NF catalyst using XRD, SEM, TEM, SAED, Raman and XPS (Fig. S7, ESI†) revealed that the catalyst well maintained its morphological and microstructural features, phase structure and chemical composition after long-term operation, demonstrating its excellent stability for the OER under alkaline conditions.
As a noble-metal-free OER catalyst, Ni1−xFexO(OH)1−yFy/NiO/NF exhibited excellent catalytic performance in terms of activity and stability. To demonstrate its application potential, we further performed the overall water-splitting test using Ni1−xFexO(OH)1−yFy/NiO/NF as the anode and Ni10Mo/MoO3−x/NF as the cathode. According to our previous study, Ni10Mo/MoO3−x/NF possesses fairly good catalytic performance for the alkaline HER. For instance, it required an overpotential of only 35 mV to afford 10 mA cm−2, which is comparable to the performance of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst.45 As shown in Fig. 6a, the thus-constructed two-electrode cell required a low cell voltage of only 1.48 V to drive 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH solution, significantly surpassing the performance of the benchmark RuO2/NF–Pt/C/NF couple (1.61 V). Furthermore, the cell using the Ni1−xFexO(OH)1−yFy/NiO/NF–Ni10Mo/MoO3−x/NF couple exhibited a voltage increment of only 6 mV over 100 h of chronopotentiometric measurement at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6b). The faradaic efficiency of overall water splitting over the non-precious OER/HER catalysts was evaluated at 10 mA cm−2. It was found that the quantities of O2 and H2 collected at anode and cathode sides, respectively, matched well with the theoretical values, and the O2/H2 volume ratio was close to 1:2, suggesting a nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency (Fig. 6c). Finally, we demonstrated that the thus-constructed water-splitting system using non-precious HER/OER catalysts could be driven by a commercial solar cell with an open voltage of around 1.5 V (Fig. 6d and Movie S1 in the ESI†).

Conclusions
In summary, our study demonstrated that anodic electrooxidation of porous NiO nanosheets in an electrolyte containing Fe2+ and F− resulted in the formation of an amorphous (Fe, F) co-doped NiOOH surface layer. Benefiting from the improved intrinsic activity and hierarchical nanostructure, the Ni1−xFexO(OH)1−yFy/NiO/NF catalyst exhibited impressively good catalytic performance for the alkaline OER, which compares favorably with that of most existing OER electrocatalysts. It required an overpotential of 186 mV to afford 10 mA cm−2 and exhibited a potential fluctuation of only ± 15 mV over 100 h of constant-current measurement at 500 mA cm−2 in a F-containing electrolyte. Our study demonstrated the pronounced effect of (Fe, F) co-doping in the oxyhydroxide phase on the OER performance. Coupled experimental and theoretical studies on this promising yet premature approach may provide greater degrees of freedom to engineer the surface properties of OER catalysts, hence offering opportunities for boosting both activity and durability.
