    , Accepted 4th December 2018First published on 8th December 2018AbstractHybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells have recently attracted much attention because of their highly efficient photovoltaic performance. However, perovskite solar cells suffer from intrinsic instabilities, which limit their commercial applications. In this study, we partially substituted the methyl-ammonium (MA) cation in MA lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3) and investigated the geometric structures and electronic and optical properties by first-principles calculations to determine their thermodynamic stabilities and optical band gaps. The results suggest that substitution of the Az cation in the A-site can enhance the stability of the MA1−xAzxPbI3 system. However, the formation energies indicate that the MA1−xCyxPbI3 series is less stable. The estimated power conversion efficiency of MA0.50Az0.50PbI3 is 23.06%, which is higher than that of MAPbI3. Notably, MA1−xAzxPbI3 (0.50 < x < 0.75) is predicted to be a promising candidate for photovoltaic applications because it has the highest theoretical power conversion efficiency, which is attributed to its optimal band gap. These results suggest that an organic cation mixing strategy can be used to tune the stability, band gap, and photovoltaic performance of hybrid perovskites, which will be particularly useful for designing light-harvesting materials for perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
In the past 10 years, hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites have become the most attractive photovoltaic material because of their high power conversion efficiency (PCE), easy solution fabrication, and low production costs. The PCE of these materials has increased to 22.1%1 from an initial PCE of 3.8% in 2009.2 Such a rapid increase in the PCE means that these materials are becoming competitive with conventional solar cells based on crystalline Si,3,4 CdTe,5 and Cu(In,Ga)Se2,6 which have been studied for several decades. Although most hybrid perovskites are limited to very small cell areas,7 large-area solar cells with PCE above 15% have been fabricated.8 Furthermore, hybrid perovskites can be synthesized at moderate temperature, making them ideal for future low lost commercial device applications. Therefore, halide perovskite-based devices are promising candidates for the next generation of solar cells. In this type of perovskite solar cell, methyl-ammonium (MA) lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3) is the most commonly used material for the light absorption layer. MAPbI3 is a direct-gap semiconductor with a band gap of 1.55 eV9 and it has strong absorption,10–12 a low exciton binding energy,13 a small electron–hole effective mass,14 and a long charge diffusion length.15–18 The main issues with this material are its poor structural stability and lead toxicity. Therefore, it is highly desirable to discover lead-free and highly stable perovskite materials with a suitable band gap. The chemical formula of hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites can be represented as ABX3, where A is a monovalent cation, such as caesium (Cs), MA, or formamidinium (CH(NH2)2, FA), B is a bivalent metal cation, such as Pb2+, Sn2+, or Ge2+, and X is a halide ion, such as I−, Br−, or Cl−. Partial or full substitution of the metal ions19–23 or anions24–28 is a powerful way to tune the stability and electronic and optical properties of hybrid perovskites. The effects of mixed cations (MA/FA,29–32 Cs/FA,33–35 and Cs/MA/FA36) at the A sites of perovskites have been experimentally investigated.
The stability of a hybrid perovskite can be estimated by the tolerance factor (t):37 (1)where RA, RB, and RX are the ionic radii of A, B, and X in the general perovskite formula ABX3, respectively. The structural stability and probable structures can be determined based on the tolerance factor approach. For hybrid perovskites, a cubic phase forms when 0.813 < t < 1.107.38 In addition, the octahedral factor μ (RB/RX ratio) can give an accurate description of the crystal stability in the range 0.44 < μ < 0.90.39 According to the above definitions, there are a limited number of organic cations that can be applied to the A-site of hybrid perovskites. The band structure of hybrid perovskite depends on the inorganic components. Although the A-site cation does not significantly influence the band structure, it plays a crucial role in determining the extent of B–X overlap and indirectly tunes the band gap to some extent. According to Shockley–Queisser theory, the optimal band gap for single-junction solar cells is in the range 1.3–1.4 eV.40 The band gap of MAPbI3 is very close to the optimal value. To obtain suitable band gap, the larger organic cation FA has been used for perovskite materials, forming the α-phase of FAPbI3 with a band gap of 1.47 eV.38 However, further increasing the size of the organic cation alters the perovskite structure, for example, orthorhombic CH3CH2NH3PbI3 has a relatively high band gap of 2.2 eV.41
MA and FA are currently the most commonly used cations in hybrid perovskites. Variation of the organic cation has received less attention because of the lack of alternatives to MA and FA. The four-membered-ring cation azetidinium ((CH2)3NH2, Az) is a promising candidate for hybrid halide perovskites.42 The effective cation radius of Az is between those of MA and FA. Az lead iodide AzPbI3 has been successfully synthesized.43 Unfortunately, it is not suitable for photovoltaics because of its wide band gap of 2.15 eV.43 Recently, the two three-membered-ring organic cations, Az and cyclopropenium (C3H3, Cy) have been investigated as organic cations at the A-site of hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites.44,45 The molecular structures of the organic A-site cations are shown in Fig. 1. The ionic radii of the Az and Cy cations are similar to or slightly larger than that of MA, but they are both smaller than FA. Therefore, these ions can fit in the perovskite framework and could form stable three-dimensional perovskite structures. Unlike other organic cations, the Cy cation is aprotic. Zheng et al.45 found that the cubic phase of AzPbI3 has higher stability and a more suitable band gap for photovoltaic applications than MAPbI3. Kasel et al.44 reported A-site substitution of Cy in orthorhombic MAPbI3. However, the effects of mixed organic cations (MA/Az and MA/Cy) on the electronic and optical properties of I4cm tetragonal MAPbI3 have not been investigated by first-principles calculations. Experimental results have confirmed that this material shows better photovoltaic performance with partial substitution of MA by FA cations by extending the optical absorption of MAPbI3.29–32

In the present work, we performed a theoretical study of the novel perovskites MA1−xBxPbI3 (B = Az or Cy) based on the I4cm tetragonal MAPbI3 perovskite structure, by partially substituted MA with Az or Cy. For each of the MA1−xBxPbI3 compounds, the geometric structure and electronic and optical properties were systematically investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The results indicate that the MA1−xAzxPbI3 (0.50 < x < 0.75) compounds are the best candidates for the light absorption layer.
2. Computational details
All of the first-principles calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) based on DFT.46 The projector-augmented wave method47 was used for the electron–ion interactions and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA)48 was used to describe the exchange–correlation effect of the electrons. The cut-off energy for the plane wavefunctions was set to 550 eV. A Monkhorst-Pack 6 × 6 × 6 k-point mesh over the first Brillion zone was used for structural optimization and a denser 8 × 8 × 8 k-point mesh was used for the electronic and optical properties. The total energy was converged to 10−5 eV. The atom coordinates were fully optimized until the residual forces were less than 0.01 eV Å−1. van der Waals interactions play an important role in hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials.49,50 The DFT-D3 functional, which includes dispersion interactions, was used for the structural optimization.51
According to previous results,52 the GGA can give an accurate bandgap for MAPbI3 without considering the spin–orbital coupling (SOC) effect. However, the accuracy may be accidental. To obtain an accurate description of the electronic properties, Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional calculations were performed.53,54 For all of the hybrid perovskites investigated, 43% non-local Fock exchange was used to calculate the density of states (DOS) at the HSE06 + SOC level to account for the relativistic effects on the heavy element Pb. These parameters exactly reproduce the experimental band gap of MAPbI3.55 In view of speed and accuracy of the calculations at the HSE06 + SOC level, Γ-centred 3 × 3 × 3 k-point grids were used for k-point sampling in the Brillouin zone. For all of the perovskite systems, the DOS and partial DOS were also calculated at the HSE06 + SOC level.
To evaluate the stabilities of the perovskite materials, we calculated the formation energies of the pure, Az-doped, and Cy-doped MAPbI3 perovskites. The crystal structures of MAI and AzI were taken from ref. 45. The crystal structure of CyI was obtained from the structure of AzI. The stable structure of hexagonal PbI2 was used. The energies of PbI2, MAI, AzI, and CyI were calculated using the same computational parameters.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometric structures
We investigated organic cation partial substitution of Az and Cy cations in the hybrid halide perovskite MAPbI3. Different proportions of the two cations (MA/Az and MA/Cy) were used, and the electronic and optical properties were investigated after structural optimization. Considering the initial alignment of the MA cations, two MAPbI3 structures were investigated. In the first structure, the C–N bonds of all of the MA cations are oriented along the c-axis (α-MAPbI3).56 In the second structure, the MA cations are oriented so that neighbouring dipoles are perpendicular to each other (β-MAPbI3). The results show that β-MAPbI3 is more stable than α-MAPbI3. We also investigated the electronic properties of α-MAPbI3 and β-MAPbI3 by evaluating their band structures. The band gaps of α-MAPbI3 and β-MAPbI3 at the PBE level are 1.73 and 1.50 eV, respectively. The significant differences in the band gaps and the stabilities of the two materials indicate that the orientation of the MA cation has an important effect on the structural and electronic properties. The band gap of β-MAPbI3 agrees reasonably well with the experimental value,9 whereas the band gap of α-MAPbI3 is larger. These findings are confirmed by previous studies.57–59
We considered organic cation partial substitution of MA with Az/Cy based on the most stable MAPbI3 structure. Given that the unit cell investigated contains four MAPbI3 units, it is necessary to simulate all of the inequivalent structures for the different dopants by gradually decreasing the proportion of MA. We investigated the MA1−xBxPbI3 materials (B = Az or Cy) for x = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00, where the values of x = 0 and 1 correspond to the pure phases of MAPbI3 and BPbI3, respectively. Geometric optimization of the MA1−xBxPbI3 (B = Az or Cy) compounds was performed at the PBE-D3 level using the MAPbI3 experimental parameters. For x = 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75, all of the possible substitution sites were considered. The optimised structures are shown in Fig. 2. The results show that different structures with the same doping percentage have different stabilities, with calculated maximum energy differences within 30 meV. The most stable structures of MA1−xBxPbI3 with x = 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 were chosen to investigate the electronic and optical properties.

The calculated volumes of the mixed-cation hybrid perovskites MA1−xBxPbI3 (B = Az or Cy, x = 0–1) are shown in Fig. 3. The volume slightly increases with increasing Az proportion, but the volume remains almost unchanged for the Cy-doped perovskite series. This difference is because of the different ionic radii of Az and Cy, which causes small differences between the MA1−xAzxPbI3 and MA1−xCyxPbI3 structures.
 Fig. 3  Calculated volumes of pure, Az-doped and Cy-doped MAPbI3. 
To further evaluate of the stabilities of the hybrid halide perovskites, we calculated the formation energies of the pure and doped systems using the following equation: ΔH = E(MA1−xBnPbI3) − [(1 − n)E(MAI) + nE(BI) + E(PbI2)](2)where B and n are the doped organic cation and doping ratio, respectively. The formation energies of all the systems are shown in Fig. 4. A negative ΔH value indicates that the structure is stable. The lower the ΔH value, the more stable the structure. All of the ΔH values are negative for the MA1−xAzxPbI3 series, but the values are positive for the MA1−xCyxPbI3 series. This indicates that substituting MA with Cy is not energetically favourable. The results reveal that the MA1−xAzxPbI3 series is more stable than MAPbI3. The radical ionization energy at the A-site has an important effect on the stabilities of hybrid halide perovskites.60 The results show that the lower the ionization energy, the more stable the structure. The ionization energies of MA and Az are 4.13 and 3.80 eV, respectively, which are in good agreement with other theoretical values and the experimental values.45,60,61 Az has a lower ionization energy than MA, and it is almost the same as that of Cs. However, Cy has a higher ionization energy (5.61 eV) than MA and Az. This explains why substituting MA with Az gives a more stable structure, but substituting MA with Cy is the opposite.

3.2. Electronic properties
To obtain insight into the effect of doped three-membered-ring organic cations on the electronic properties, we performed band structure calculations for all of the structures at the PBE level. The calculated direct band structure of MAPbI3 at the Γ point of the Brillouin zone is shown in Fig. 5. The band gap of MAPbI3 at the PBE level is 1.50 eV, which agrees well with a previous theoretical result of 1.53 eV62 and the experimental value of 1.55 eV.9 To obtain more accurate band gaps, we performed HSE06 + SOC calculations. From the HSE06 + SOC calculation, the band gap of the MAPbI3 structure is 1.52 eV, which is also in good agreement with the experimental value (1.55 eV).9 The PBE calculations indicate that all of the systems possess direct band gaps with the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum located at the Γ point (0.0, 0.0, 0.0).
 Fig. 5  Band structure of the MAPbI3 structure calculated at the PBE level. 
The DOS of the pure, Az-doped, and Cy-doped MAPbI3 structures are shown in Fig. 6. The top valence band is mainly composed of Pb-6s and I-5p anti-bonding orbitals, and the lowest conduction band is mainly composed of Pb-6p orbitals with weak coupling with I ions. The organic cations do not affect the electronic states because they are far from the band edges. The DOS of all of the materials were analysed based on the HSE06 + SOC results.

(a–i) DOS of pure, Az-doped (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00), and Cy-doped (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00) MAPbI3, respectively. The peaks of the valence band energies were chosen as the Fermi level and set to zero. 
The calculated band gaps of the Az-doped and Cy-doped MAPbI3 structures are shown in Fig. 7. The band gaps of the Az-doped and Cy-doped MAPbI3 systems calculated at the PBE level show similar trends to those calculated at the HSE06 + SOC level. The results show that the band gap of MA1−xAzxPbI3 decreases as x increases, especially for x = 0.75 and 1.00, while the band gap of MA1−xCyxPbI3 shows a slight increasing trend with increasing x. The band gap of MA1−xAzxPbI3 greatly changes when x reaches 0.75, which indicates that the optimal band gap of MA1−xAzxPbI3 can be obtained by controlling the fraction of Az cations to between 0.50 and 0.75. Furthermore, Az cations can be used to change the band gap of the hybrid perovskite from 1.52 to 1.13 eV because they affect the inorganic framework.

It is important to understand the reasons for the change in the band gap of the cation-doped hybrid perovskites. Previous reports have indicated that the electronic properties of perovskites are affected by structural distortion, and the main factor is the Pb–I–Pb bond angle.63 The Pb–I–Pb bond angles can be separated into two categories: those in the ab plane and those along the c axis. Analysis of the degree of distortion of the Pb–I–Pb bonds can provide an explanation for the difference in the band gaps of pure and cation-doped MAPbI3. The Pb–I–Pb bond angles of the systems are listed in Table 1. The smaller distortions of the Pb–I–Pb bonds for MA0.25Az0.75PbI3 and AzPbI3 result in a smaller band gap of 1.13 eV compared with that of MAPbI3 (1.52 eV). However, the slightly greater distortions of the Pb–I–Pb bonds for CyPbI3 result in a higher band gap of 1.56 eV compared with that of MAPbI3. It is difficult to determine which of the two types of Pb–I–Pb bond angles plays a greater role in tuning the band gap. The effects of both of the Pb–I–Pb angles should be considered together. For MA0.25Az0.75PbI3 and AzPbI3, the Pb–I–Pb bond angles are close to the ideal structure.

To obtain more insight into the electronic properties, we performed Bader charge analysis of the MA1−xBxPbI3 systems. Because of the different chemical environments of the iodine ions in the inorganic framework, these ions can be divided into two categories: apical iodide ions (Ia) and equatorial iodide ions (Ie).50,64 The results of Bader charge analysis are shown in Table 2. The effect of Cy doping is weaker than that of Az doping, which is indicated by the reduced charge transfer. For the MA1−xAzxPbI3 system, charge transfer of Pb cations gradually decreases with increasing x, except for MA0.25Az0.75PbI3. However, it is almost unchanged for the iodide ions. Notably, MA0.25Az0.75PbI3 is quite different from the other structures in terms of Bader charge analysis of the organic and Pb cations. For MAPbI3, charge transfer of the equatorial iodide ions is slightly stronger than that of the apical iodide ions, which is similar to the MA1−xAzxPbI3 system. The situation is apparently the opposite for the MA1−xCyxPbI3 system because of involvement of the Cy cations. Additionally, charge transfer of the organic cations and iodide ions gradually decreases with increasing x for the Cy-doped series.

3.3. Optical properties
To investigate the light absorption ability of each material in the visible light region, we calculated the optical absorption coefficient of each structure. The optical properties can be derived from dielectric functions. The imaginary part ε2(ω) can be calculated from the direction interband transitions given by the Fermi golden rule:65 (3)where the parameters Ω, ω, u, ν, and c are the unit cell volume, photon frequency, and the vectors defining polarisation of the incident electric field, valence band, and conduction band, respectively. The real ε1(ω) and imaginary ε2(ω) parts of the complex dielectric function are related by the Kramers–Krong translation:66,67 (4)and the absorption coefficient I(ω) can be calculated by the following explicit relation:68 (5)
Strong optical absorption in the visible zone is crucially important for photovoltaic materials. The absorption coefficient I(ω) is directly related to the band gaps for these materials. The optical absorption spectra were obtained using the PBE functional with a scissor operator to obtain the band gap calculated at the HSE06 + SOC level. For comparison, the optical absorption of MAPbI3 was also calculated. The absorption spectra of the perovskite compounds are shown in Fig. 8(a and b). The absorption coefficient of pure MAPbI3 reaches its highest value of 6 × 105 in the visible light region, which agrees with the results reported by Sun et al.69 From the absorption spectra in Fig. 8(b), MA1−xCyxPbI3 is expected to exhibit stronger optical absorption than MAPbI3 in the entire visible light region. For MA1−xAzxPbI3 with x = 0.75 and 1.00, the absorption spectra redshift because of the reduced band gaps, and the absorption coefficients are higher than that of MAPbI3 in the range 400–900 nm. The MA1−xAzxPbI3 with x = 0.25 and 0.50 have almost the same absorption ability as MAPbI3. In the short wavelength region (300–400 nm), the absorption coefficients of all of the MA1−xAzxPbI3 materials are slightly lower than that of MAPbI3.
 Fig. 8  Calculated optical absorption spectra of the pure, Az-doped, and Cy-doped perovskites with different proportions of the (a) Az and (b) Cy dopant. 
To further evaluate the solar cell performance of the mixed-cation perovskite materials, we calculated the short circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), and PCE (η) using the following equations:40,70,71 (6) eVOC = Eg − Eloss(7) (8) (9)where e, E, S(E), Eg, Eloss, FF, and Psun are the electronic charge, incident photon energy, incident spectral power per unit area, band gap of the mixed-cation perovskite, loss in the potential, fill factor, and total incident power, respectively. The maximum short circuit current density JSC can be calculated by assuming that all of the incident photons are absorbed when their energies are higher than the band gap energy of the mixed-cation perovskite. Here, we used the solar spectrum data provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to calculate the short circuit current density. From a previous report,71Eloss can be assumed to be 0.7 or 0.5 eV. We chose FF = 80% to agree with the reported PCE of MAPbI3 single crystals with Eloss = 0.7 eV.72
Considering the stabilities of the perovskite materials, we only calculated the short circuit current density, open circuit voltage, and theoretical PCE for pure and Az-doped MAPbI3 using the same parameters. The results are listed in Table 3. MA0.25Az0.75PbI3 and AzPbI3 have the highest JSC of 38.95 mA cm−2, which is much higher than those of the other materials. The different JSC values result from the different band gaps, and the calculated band gaps of MA0.25Az0.75PbI3 and AzPbI3 are much lower than those of the other structures. When Eloss = 0.7 eV, the estimated PCE values of MA0.75Az0.25PbI3 and MA0.50Az0.50PbI3 are almost the same as that of the MAPbI3 structure. However, the estimated PCE values of MA0.25Az0.75PbI3 and AzPbI3 are 15.09% owing to their lower band gaps. When Eloss = 0.5 eV is used, all of the estimated PCE values are greater than 22%. Specifically, MA0.50Az0.50PbI3 has a high VOC of 0.98 V and its JSC of 26.12 mA cm−2 is higher than that of MAPbI3. MA0.50Az0.50PbI3 has the highest PCE of 23.06% and it is a potential candidate for perovskite solar cells. The theoretical limit of the PCE of perovskites is estimated to be approximately 30% when the band gap is 1.3–1.4 eV.73 Therefore, MA1−xAzxPbI3 is predicted to be the best candidate when the Az content is between 0.50 and 0.75, which is attributed to its optimal band gap. Taking the stability and electronic and optical properties into consideration, replacing MA with Az is an efficient way of enhancing the photoelectronic properties of perovskite solar cells.

According to this study, the photovoltaic performance of perovskite materials can be improved by substituting MA cations with Az cations. Recently, the effect of substitution of FA into the MA sites of orthorhombic perovskite MAPbI3 has been investigated by first-principles calculations.64 The results showed that the photovoltaic performance of MA1-xFAxPbI3 significantly improves by addition of FA cations. Experimental results show that superior photovoltaic performance is achieved by substitution of FA cations in the perovskite series MA1−xFAxPbI3 compared with those of both FAPbI3 and MAPbI3.29,31 Although the toxicity of heavy metal lead has still not been addressed, the amount of lead used is reduced because of the better photovoltaic capabilities of the perovskite materials.
4. Conclusions
We have investigated the effects of two three-membered-ring cations on the structure, stability, and photoelectronic properties of MA1−xBxPbI3 (B = Az or Cy) based on the tetragonal MAPbI3 structure. The results indicate that replacing MA with Az is more effective than replacing MA with Cy based on the stability. The ionization energies of Az and Cy provide a good explanation for the difference in the stabilities of the corresponding perovskite systems. With increasing concentration of Az, the band gap of MA1−xAzxPbI3 gradually decreases and plateaus when x ≥ 0.75. This result indicates that a smaller band gap can be realised by Az doping, and the optimal band gap can be achieved by controlling the doping concentration of Az to between 0.50 and 0.75. We found that structural distortion plays an important role in determining the electronic properties of the perovskites. An absorption redshift occurs for the mixed MA1−xAzxPbI3 perovskites. MA0.25Az0.75PbI3 and AzPbI3 show the highest optical absorption among the mixed systems in the range of 400–900 nm. Compared with the MAPbI3 structure, the MA1−xCyxPbI3 series has stronger optical absorption in the visible light region and suitable band gaps, but all of the MA1−xCyxPbI3 structures are less stable. Additionally, all of the estimated PCE values of the MA1−xAzxPbI3 series are higher than 22%. MA0.50Az0.50PbI3 with the highest theoretical PCE of 23.06% is a potential candidate for perovskite solar cells because of its better stability than the other structures. The results indicate that the novel MA1−xAzxPbI3 perovskite (0.50 < x < 0.75) has the optimal band gap (1.3–1.4 eV) and the maximum theoretical PCE. This study provides insight for designing more efficient perovskite solar cells.
