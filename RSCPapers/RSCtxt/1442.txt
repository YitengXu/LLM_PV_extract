    , Accepted 15th December 2017First published on 15th December 2017AbstractThe present joint experimental and theoretical work provides in-depth understanding on the morphology and structural, electronic, and optical properties of ZnWO4 nanocrystals. Monoclinic ZnWO4 nanocrystals were prepared at three different temperatures (140, 150, and 160 °C) by a microwave hydrothermal method. Then, the samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction with Rietveld refinement analysis, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electronic microscopy, micro-Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and photoluminescence measurements. First-principles theoretical calculations within the framework of density functional theory were employed to provide information at the atomic level. The band structure diagram, density of states, Raman and infrared spectra were calculated to understand the effect of structural order–disorder on the properties of ZnWO4. The effects of the synthesis temperature on the above properties were rationalized. The band structure revealed direct allowed transitions between the VB and CB and the experimental results in the ultraviolet-visible region were consistent with the theoretical results. Moreover, the surface calculations allowed the association of the surface energy stabilization with the temperature used in the synthesis of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals. The photoluminescence properties of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals prepared at 140, 150, and 160 °C were attributed to oxygen vacancies in the [WO6] and [ZnO6] clusters, causing a red shift of the spectra. The ZnWO4 nanocrystals obtained at 160 °C exhibited excellent photodegradation of Rhodamine under ultraviolet light irradiation, which was found to be related to the surface energy and the types of clusters formed on the surface of the catalyst.
Introduction
Water pollution by industrial effluents is a major source of concern for environmentalists worldwide.1 The agriculture and textile industries are among the largest polluters of water globally. About 10000 tons of synthetic dyes are produced per year.2 Inevitably, losses take place during dye manufacturing and processing operations, accounting for approximately 12% of the dye production. The effluents from these operations are usually highly colored, toxic, carcinogenic, or mutagenic waste. The color of the dyes makes the effluents aesthetically unpleasant, and the dyes may also undergo degradation to form byproducts that are carcinogenic and toxic. Moreover, they also reduce the photosynthetic activity of water streams and disturb the aquatic equilibrium.3,4
Many of these chemicals released by different industries cannot be removed by filtration or other simple processes. Owing to the complexity of their structure and their low biodegradability, the removal of these dyes from water poses a challenging problem.5–7 The removal of such materials to safe levels through green routes and within reasonable cost is of current interest in pollutant management.8–13 All these considerations have drawn attention towards the crucial need for nanomaterials for environmental remediation owing to their ability to induce photocatalytic oxidation (complete mineralization) of pollutants over their surface under UV/visible/solar light irradiation.14–19 Nanomaterials are very promising materials as they possess high surface area, sorption sites, short intraparticle diffusion distances, and interesting surface chemistry; hence, they readily adsorb dye molecules.20–22 Consequently, the development of semiconductor nanostructures as photocatalysts for sunlight utilization is increasingly becoming an important research topic owing to the current global energy shortage. Solar energy conversion through photocatalysis needs to maximize the utilization of visible light; dye-sensitized semiconductors have been widely studied for this purpose.23–26
ZnWO4 is characterized by its high light yield, average refractive index, as well as X-ray absorption coefficient and short decay time, and it is considered to be a promising material for photocatalysts for organic pollution degradation.27–29 In this context, vast research efforts have been dedicated in the last few years to the synthesis of ZnWO4 nanostructures as promising visible light photocatalysts for organic pollutant degradation due to their high photosensitivity, excellent chemical stability, non-toxicity, several unique characteristics,27,28 and their potential applications in optical fibers, scintillation materials, luminescence devices, solid-state laser hosts, optical and acoustic fibers, humidity and gas sensors,28,30–37 electronic devices, anode materials for lithium-ion batteries,38 stimulated Raman scattering (SRS),39 and heavy material treatments through electro-assisted photocatalytic systems.40
To date, a plethora of synthetic methods have been used to obtain ZnWO4 samples, such as solid-state reactions, co-precipitation, mechanochemistry, the Czochralski technique, ultrasonic irradiation, self-propagating combustion, sol–gel, hydrothermal microwave-assisted methods,28,31,42–62 electrosynthesis,29 and solvothermal synthesis.38 However, a comprehensive understanding of how different synthetic methods can affect the morphology, photoluminescence properties, as well as the photocatalytic activity (PCA) of the final materials has been rarely discussed in the literature. In this work, ZnWO4 nanocrystals were synthesized by a hydrothermal microwave-assisted method as a fast, simple, and efficient method to prepare nanosized inorganic materials.63–65 Microwave irradiation has been widely applied for the rapid synthesis of inorganic solids. Since this type of radiation affords internal heating of the material, lower temperatures and shorter times can be used compared to those needed when applying conventional heating.66–68 Microwave heating is an inexpensive, facile, and relatively fast method for the preparation of nanocrystalline samples with unique or enhanced properties.
Inspired by the above considerations, in this paper, we report the synthesis of ZnWO4 nanocrystals via a microwave hydrothermal (MH) method at three different temperatures (140, 150, and 160 °C). Our principal aim was to understand the fine effects of the synthesis temperature on the morphology and photoluminescence properties of the as-synthesized ZnWO4 nanocrystals and to investigate the role of the electronic structure on their photocatalytic activity. Herein, we clarify these points by performing a detailed theoretical and experimental study on the PCA of ZnWO4 nanocrystals. The evaluation was carried out by decomposing Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible irradiation. The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Rietveld refinement, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electronic microscopy (TEM and HR-TEM), and micro-Raman (MR) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Moreover, their optical properties were investigated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) measurements at room temperature. First-principles theoretical calculations within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) were employed to obtain information at the atomic level. The band structure diagram, density of states (DOS), and Raman and Infrared spectra were calculated to understand the effects of structural order–disorder on the properties of ZnWO4.
Experimental and theoretical methods
Synthesis of ZnWO4 nanocrystals
The ZnWO4 nanocrystals were prepared by the MH method at 140, 150 and 160 °C for 1 hour. The corresponding procedure is described below: 2 × 10−3 mol of tungstate(VI) sodium dihydrate (Na2WO4·2H2O; 99.5% purity, Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 × 10−3 mol of zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2; 99.9% purity, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved separately in 50 mL of deionised water at room temperature in a beaker under magnetic stirring. The solution with Zn2+ and NO3− was added to the glass beaker of the solution containing the WO42− ions and this solution remained at room temperature under magnetic stirring for some minutes until complete precipitation. Thus, a white suspension appeared and 100 mL of these solutions were inverted into a Teflon autoclave vessel without magnetic stirring. This suspension was processed at 140, 150 and 160 °C for 1 hour. The resulting suspensions were washed several times with deionized water to remove the residual Na+ ions. The crystalline ZnWO4 nanocrystals were collected and dried in an oven at 70 °C for some hours. Previously, Tan and co-workers59 investigated the formation of the ZnWO4 phase by microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis and only obtained the pure phase at 220 °C for 1 h. In the present study, we also obtain the pure phase at lower temperatures.
Characterization
The ZnWO4 nanocrystals were structurally characterized by XRD patterns using a D/Max-2000PC diffractometer Rigaku (Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the 2θ range from 10° to 70° in the normal routine with a scanning velocity of 2° min−1 and from 10° to 110° with a scanning velocity of 1° min−1 in the Rietveld routine. MR spectroscopy was conducted on a Horiba Jobin-Yvon (Japan) spectrometer charge-coupled device detector and argon-ion laser (Melles Griot, United States) operating at 514.5 nm with a maximum power of 200 mW. The spectra were measured in the range 200–1000 cm−1. FT-IR spectroscopy was recorded in the range from 200 to 1000 cm−1 using KBr pellets as a reference in a Bomem Michelson spectrophotometer in transmittance mode (model MB102). The shapes and sizes of these ZnWO4 nanocrystals were observed with a field-emission scanning electron microscope model FE-SEM Inspect F50 (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) operated at 5 kV. The TEM analysis was performed using a JEM 2100F TEM/STEM microscope operating at 200 kV. The optical properties of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals were analyzed by UV-vis and PL spectroscopies. UV-vis spectra were taken using a (Varian, USA) spectrophotometer (model Cary 5G) in a diffuse-reflectance mode. PL measurements were performed through a Monospec 27 monochromator (Thermal Jarrel Ash) coupled to a R446 photomultiplier (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). A krypton-ion laser (Coherent Innova 90K; λ = 350.7 nm) was used as the excitation source; its maximum output power was maintained at 500 mW. The laser beam was passed through an optical chopper, and its maximum power on the sample was maintained at 40 mW. PL measurements were performed at room temperature.
Photocatalytic tests of ZnWO4
Photocatalytic activities (PCAs) of the prepared ZnWO4 nanocrystals were evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of 100 mL of Rhodamine B (RhB) in aqueous solution under UV light. In a typical process, 50 mg of ZnWO4 nanocrystals synthesized by the MH method at 140, 150 and 160 °C for 1 hour were dispersed in 50 mL of the RhB solution (1 × 10−5 mol). The above mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Pyrex glass bottle and stirred for 30 min to make the catalyst blend evenly in the solution. The suspensions were irradiated by six lamps (PHILIPS TL-D, 15 W). After the reaction, the mixture was centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 min to completely remove the catalyst particles. The remaining solution was analyzed by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy on a V-660 spectrophotometer (JASCO). Variations in the absorption band (maximum λ = 554 nm) were monitored.
Computational method
Theoretical calculations for ZnWO4 were performed using DFT as implemented in the VASP program.69,70 The Kohn–Sham equations were solved using the functional proposed by Perdew, Purke, and Ernzerhof (PBE),71 and the electron–ion interaction was described using projector augmented wave pseudopotentials.69,72 The plane-wave expansion was truncated at a cutoff energy of 460 eV, and the Brillouin zones were sampled through 6 × 6 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack special k-points grids that ensured geometrical and energetic convergence for the ZnWO4 structure. A vacuum spacing of 15 Å was introduced in the z-direction such that the surfaces did not interact with each other. Each surface was modeled using stoichiometric systems. The surface energy (Esurf) was defined as: (1)where Eslab is the total energy per repeating cell of the slab, Ebulk is the total energy of the perfect crystal per molecular unit, n is the number of molecular units at the surface, and A is the surface area per repeating cell of the 2 sides of the slab. The procedure to obtain the complete set of morphologies, based on the Wulff construction and the surface energy, has been previously presented by Andrés et al.73
The screened hybrid functional HSE06 was used in order to obtain the band structure diagram, the density of states (DOS) as well as Raman/IR vibrational modes using numerical second derivatives of the total energies.
Results and discussion
XRD analysis
The XRD technique allows the degree of structural order–disorder at long-range distances or the periodicity of ZnWO4 nanocrystals to be ascertained. Fig. 1(a–c) shows the influence of the reaction temperature on ZnWO4 nanocrystals synthesized at 140, 150, and 160 °C for 1 h via the MH method. Fig. 1(a–c) shows that the diffraction peaks for all ZnWO4 nanocrystals can be successfully indexed to the pure monoclinic sanmartinite phase74,75 with a wolframite structure and a space group of P2/c41,46,74–76 with C42h symmetry52,77 and two molecules per unit cell (Z = 2).

These crystals present sharp and well-defined diffraction peaks, indicating a good degree of structural order at long-range distances.61,78–82 The strong diffraction peaks for the (111) plane observed in Fig. 1(a–c) suggest that all the prepared ZnWO4 samples are highly crystalline.74 All diffraction peaks are consistent with the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) pattern No. 84540.83 As can be observed from Fig. 1, the intensity of the diffraction peaks increased with the increasing temperature, from 140 to 160 °C, during the MH procedure. This behavior confirms that there is structural organization at long distances and indicates the high crystallinity of the materials. In addition, the diffraction peaks were slightly shifted to higher 2θ values with the increasing synthesis temperature, consequently resulting in smaller interplanar distances and causing a slight reduction of the unit cell volume.
The average crystallite size was estimated by Scherrer's equation using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most intense peak of the (111) plane. As reported in the literature,74 Scherrer's equation (eqn (2)) is described as follows: (2)where D is the average crystallite size, λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.15406 nm), θ is the Bragg angle, and B is the FWHM.74,84 As observed, the average crystallite size for the ZnWO4 samples increased slightly with the increasing temperature, from 11.7 to 13.9 nm, for the ZnWO4 nanocrystals prepared by the MH method.
Rietveld refinement analysis
Fig. ESI-1 (ESI†) shows the Rietveld refinement plot for the ZnWO4 nanocrystals prepared by the MH method at 140, 150, and 160 °C for 1 h.
Structural analysis via Rietveld refinement85 was employed to confirm the wolframite structure of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals. Such a structural refinement was performed using the general structure analysis (GSAS) program.86 The calculated patterns were adjusted to fit the observed patterns and thus provide the structural parameters of the material and the diffraction profile. As such, the experimental lattice parameters, unit cell volume, and atomic positions of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals were calculated using the Rietveld refinement method. The refined parameters were discussed in a previous work.87
The analysis of Fig. ESI-1(a–c) (ESI†) shows good agreement between the observed XRD patterns and the theoretical fit, indicating the successful application of the Rietveld refinement method. Therefore, all the structural refinement results obtained using this method85 were consistent with the ICSD No. 84540 pattern, confirming the presence of a single phase in all the ZnWO4 nanocrystals corresponding to a wolframite structure with a symmetry space group P2/c and two molecules per unit cell (Z = 2). These results confirmed the effectiveness of our synthetic method.
The success of the Rietveld refinement method was verified by the small differences (nearly zero) in the intensity scale, as illustrated by the line YObs − YCalc. The experimental and calculated data from the DFT and Rietveld refinement methods are summarized in Table 1, including the lattice parameters, cell volume, and statistical parameters (RBragg, χ2, Rwp, and Rp). The statistical R-values presented in this table suggest that the refinement results are reliable.

From the results reported in Table 1, it is possible to verify slight variations in the lattice parameters and cell volume values (all consistent with the ICSD card No. 84540). These results indicate that the octahedral [ZnO6] and [WO6] clusters (the building blocks of the structure) are distorted, thus generating structural defects in the ZnWO4 lattice.

Table 2 shows the atomic coordinates for the Zn, W, and O atoms obtained from the Rietveld refinement. Upon analyzing these data, it is possible to note a considerable variation in the atomic positions of the oxygen atoms, as these atoms do not occupy fixed positions in such a structure, while the Zn and W cations practically maintain their fixed positions throughout the structure. Fig. 2 illustrates the unit cell of ZnWO4 prepared by the MH method at 160 °C for 1 h with a P2/c space group and C42h point-group symmetry,88,89 and also the experimental and calculated clusters present in the ZnWO4 wolframite, modeled using the Visualization for Electronic and Structural Analysis (VESTA) program.90

 Fig. 2  (a) Unit cell of ZnWO4, and (b) bond distances of the theoretical calculations and experimental results for the [ZnO6] and [WO6] clusters. 
The structural parameters and atomic coordinates obtained from the Rietveld refinement were employed to model the unit cell of ZnWO4, whose values are listed in Tables 1 and 2.
Analysis of the results reported in Tables 1 and 2 confirmed that the ZnWO4 lattice is composed of Zn and W cations coordinated with six oxygen atoms forming distorted [ZnO6] and [WO6] clusters (6 vertices and faces, respectively, and 12 edges) in an octahedral configuration. These results are consistent with those reported in the literature.88,89,91 Therefore, both crystals have clusters of the symmetry group Oh with octahedral symmetry sites (C2). In the monoclinic ZnWO4 structure, there are distorted [ZnO6] and [WO6] clusters with three pairs of different lengths for both Zn–O and W–O bonds (see Fig. 2(b)). There are two types of O anions in the [WO6] clusters: four O1 and two O2; while there are two positions for O1 and four positions for O2 in the [ZnO6] clusters.91–93
Micro-Raman spectroscopy analysis

Fig. 3(A) displays the MR spectra of ZnWO4 nanocrystals synthesized by the MH method at 140, 150, and 160 °C for 1 h. A comparison of the experimental and calculated Raman vibrational modes of ZnWO4 nanocrystals is presented in Fig. 3(B), and their values are listed in Table ESI-1 (ESI†) in comparison with relevant data from the literature.94,95

As shown in Table ESI-1 (ESI†) both the experimental and theoretical results are in good agreement with the results found in the literature. The slight variations in the positions of the typical vibrational modes of our samples relative to those reported in the literature can be attributed to the different syntheses, crystal sizes, distortions of the bonds and angles of the [O–Zn–O]/[O–W–O] moieties at short-range distances, and/or intermolecular forces between the [ZnO6]–[WO6] clusters.89
The ZnWO4 nanocrystals present a wolframite structure within the monoclinic space group P2/c96 and 36 lattice modes in accordance with group theory calculations; however, only 18 vibrational modes (8Ag + 10Bg) are Raman active.97 These vibrational modes are classified into two types: internal and external modes. The internal vibrational modes are assigned to distorted octahedral [WO6] clusters, while the external vibrational modes are associated with the distorted octahedral [ZnO6] clusters in the lattice.89,98
The phonon frequencies of the internal vibration modes associated with the W–O bonds of [WO6] are higher than those of the external modes associated with the Zn–O bonds. This occurs because the internal covalent bonding in the [WO6] octahedrons is stronger than the external lattice binding in [ZnO6].98,99 In general, internal vibrations are expected to occur at higher wavenumbers than external vibrations;99 this behavior arises from the strong covalent nature of the W–O bonds.
Analysis of Fig. 3(A) revealed the presence of 18 well-defined Raman active vibrational modes between 50 and 1000 cm−1. Higher symmetric and anti-symmetric stretching modes are associated with internal vibrations inside the [WO6] clusters, showing several peaks corresponding to Raman-active internal Ag and Bg modes with their vibrations composed of six internal modes (four Ag and two Bg).89,99
The main mode (Ag) is associated with the intense peak located at around 903.3 cm−1 ascribed to the symmetric stretching of (← O ← W → O →), see inset in Fig. 3(A). The Raman Bg and Ag modes at 781.6 and 705.2 cm−1, respectively, are assigned to the asymmetric stretching of (→ O → W → O →), see inset in Fig. 3(A).89,99 The Raman Ag and Bg modes at 672.9 (Bg), 543.8 (Ag), 513.0 (Bg), and 403.5 (Ag) cm−1 are attributed to stretching modes of the long W–O bonds. The Raman modes of low intensity at around 120.1 (Ag), 145.7 (Bg), 161.5 (Bg), 188.5 (Bg), and 194.1 (Ag) are assigned to the symmetric stretch of (← O ← Zn → O →) bonds, while the modes at 309.9 (Bg), 269.9 (Ag), and 277.3 (Ag) are attributed to the vibrations of cationic sublattices (see inset in Fig. 3(A)).76,89,99–101 Therefore, all the vibration modes presented in Fig. 3(A) are intense and well-defined, suggesting that the ZnWO4 nanocrystals are structurally ordered in the short range and correspond to a wolframite-type monoclinic structure.
Table ESI-2 (ESI†) shows the FWHM, and the Raman peak position and intensity for the ZnWO4 nanocrystals. The linewidth of the main mode (Ag) for the intense peak located at around 903.3 cm−1 was obtained by assuming a deconvolution of Lorentzian curves. Table ESI-2 (ESI†) illustrates the temperature dependence of the linewidth, showing narrow and more intense peaks, and a moderate wavenumber shift is also observed with the increasing temperature. This reveals a temperature dependence of the structural order in the short range. These results corroborate the XRD and Rietveld refinement data.
FT-IR spectroscopy analysis
Molybdate and tungstate crystals with a wolframite-type monoclinic structure exhibit 36 different vibrational modes according to group theory calculations. Among these vibrational modes, 18 modes (8Au and 10Bu) are expected to appear in the infrared spectra; however, three modes (1Au and 2Bu) correspond to acoustic vibrations and thus, only 15 modes (7Au and 8Bu) are IR active.76,89
In this work, IR spectroscopy was used in transmittance mode to characterize the structure in the metal–oxygen bond region. The stretching absorption bands (symmetric, asymmetric, and anti-symmetric) associated with the metal–oxygen bonds can be observed between 200 and 1000 cm−1.

Fig. 4(A and B) shows the normalized FT-IR spectra of the experimental and theoretical infrared modes of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals prepared at 140, 150, and 160 °C, respectively. Fig. 4(A) displays 10 IR active vibrational modes. The Bu mode at around 256 cm−1 is attributed to the asymmetric stretching of bonds in the [ZnO6]–[ZnO6] clusters. The Au mode at 321 and 368 cm−1 is assigned to the symmetric stretch (O ← Zn ← O → Zn → O) of the distorted octahedral [ZnO6]–[ZnO6] clusters, and the Au mode at around 428 cm−1 is ascribed to the asymmetric stretch (O → Zn → O → Zn → O) of the distorted octahedral [ZnO6] clusters.

The Bu and Au modes at approximately 465 and 529 cm−1 are associated with the asymmetric stretching (O ← W ← O ← W ← O) of distorted octahedral [WO6]–[WO6] clusters.
The broad absorption band at 600 cm−1 corresponds to a Bu mode attributed to asymmetrical vibrations of the bridging oxygen atoms of the O–W–O groups of the distorted octahedral [WO6] clusters (see inset in Fig. 4(A)). The absorption band at around 712 cm−1 is assigned to the Au mode and the absorption bands at around 822 and 878 cm−1 are related to the Bu and Au modes, respectively, which are assigned to the symmetric stretching (← O ← W → O →) of the distorted octahedral [WO6] clusters.46,47,76,89,100,102 The FT-IR results confirm the formation of ZnWO4 nanocrystals in all the samples.100

Fig. 4(B) shows the theoretical and experimental positions of the FT-IR active modes and their values are listed in Table ESI-3 (ESI†) as well as values reported in the literature.103,104 Analysis of the results revealed good agreement between the wavenumbers of the FT-IR modes of the experimental and theoretical calculations; however, the theoretical results illustrated more Bu and Au modes at 96, 134, 176, and 231 cm−1, which were not experimentally detected due to the low detection limit of the FT-IR spectrophotometer used. In addition, Table ESI-3 (ESI†) shows that both experimental and theoretical results are in good agreement with the results found in the literature. The same conclusion was reached for the FT-IR and Raman modes, in which a small variation in the positions of FT-IR active modes of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals was observed. This behavior is probably due to variations in the bonds lengths and angles of the O–Zn–O, O–W–O, and Zn–O–W moieties.89
FE-SEM, TEM, and HRTEM images and Wulff construction analysis
The detailed morphology of the materials was examined by FE-SEM, TEM, and HR-TEM. As shown in Fig. 5, different morphologies were obtained upon changing the synthesis temperature.
 Fig. 5  FE-SEM images of ZnWO4 nanocrystals, obtained by the MH method at (A and B) 140, (C and D) 150 and (E and F) 160 °C for 1 h. 

Fig. 5(A–C) shows the FE-SEM images, where the presence of ZnWO4 nanocrystals of agglomerated nature can be discerned in all samples. However, it was not possible to correctly define the shape and size of the nanocrystals. Thus, the TEM technique was used to better define the morphological characteristics of the nanostructures and the surface morphology of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals, as well as to confirm the wolframite monoclinic structure.

Fig. 6(A, E, I, and M) shows the TEM images of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals as a function of temperature. An analysis of these images points out that the temperature has a large effect on the morphology and size of ZnWO4 nanocrystals. At 140 °C, the nanocrystals exhibit an undefined morphology (see Fig. 6(A)). However, deformed polyhedrons were observed when the temperature was increased to 150 °C, revealing the formation of nanorods of rectangular form with different sizes (see Fig. 6(E)). At 160 °C, ZnWO4 nanocrystals were obtained as fully defined polyhedral (e.g., nanorods), rectangular, and hexagonal plates (see Fig. 6(I) and (M)).
 Fig. 6  TEM images of ZnWO4 nanocrystals obtained by the MH method at 140 °C (A), 150 °C (E) and 160 °C (I and M) for 1 h; HR-TEM images of ZnWO4 nanocrystals prepared at 140 °C (B and C), 150 °C (F and G) and 160 °C (J, K and N, O); surface models involved in each morphology of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals, (D) (100) surface for 140 °C, (H) (111) surface for 150 °C and (L and P) ((011), (010), respectively) surfaces for 160 °C. Surface energy (Esurf) in eV. 
The crystalline planes and morphologies are also shown in Fig. 6(B, C, F, G, J, K, N, and O). These images confirm the high crystallinity of the materials and prove that these nanocrystals have the monoclinic structure of wolframite.
Growth is observed in the (100) direction for the sample processed at 140 °C, in the (111) direction for the sample prepared at 150 °C, and growth of the sample synthesized at 160 °C occurs in the (011) and (010) faces.
Therefore, it is possible to conclude that these nanocrystals do not present a predominant growth mechanism; however, the increase in the temperature changes the growth process from the (100) and (111) directions to the (010) and (011) ones. Both the (010) and (011) surfaces present lower Esurf values than the (100) and (111) surfaces, as demonstrated below by theoretical calculations.
The size distributions are shown in Fig. ESI-2 (ESI†) and analysis of the results indicates that the length and thickness of the samples increase with the temperature.
Table ESI-4 (ESI†) lists the corresponding surface energy (Esurf) values calculated using the DFT method for the low-index facets of ZnWO4. The stability order of the surfaces is (010), 0.26 eV < (110), 0.54 eV < (011), 0.58 eV < (001), 0.84 eV < (111), 1.23 eV < (101), 1.43 eV < (100), 2.63 eV. The (010), (011), (001), and (100) surfaces are ZnO-terminated, while the (110), (111), and (101) surfaces are WO-terminated. It is worth noting that there are different types of [ZnOx] and [WOx] clusters at the top (first layer) of these surfaces in the presence of oxygen vacancies, , and also in the second layer for the (110), (011), (001), (111), and (101) surfaces. Fig. 7 depicts the surface representation of the ZnWO4 structure used in the calculations.
 Fig. 7  Surface representation of the ZnWO4 structure. 
Based on the Esurf values for all the facets and the Wulff construction implemented in the VESTA program,90 it was possible to determine the crystal shape of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals in vacuum. The present equilibrium morphology was derived from the calculated Esurf values under the assumption that the crystal faces with the lowest surface energies control the crystal morphology, as illustrated in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  Map of morphologies of ZnWO4 with (010), (110), (011), (001), (111), (101) and (100) surfaces. Surface energy is expressed in J m−2. 
The ideal morphology of ZnWO4 is depicted in the center of Fig. 8, where a map of the available morphologies of ZnWO4 is also presented. Different crystal morphologies can be achieved by tuning the surface energy values of some facets using the Wulff construction method.73,105,106 Based on these results, it is possible to modulate the morphology, which is dependent on the relative values of the surface energy as well as the percentage of the area in the structure.73,105,106 Thus, the material properties are linked with the type of clusters on the surface.
In the case of ZnWO4 nanocrystals, it is not possible to associate the FE-SEM images to the Wulff construction. However, we can associate the surface energy stabilization with the temperature. At 140 °C, the only surface found is the interplanar distal 4.69 Å, corresponding to the (100) plane; at 150 °C, the interplanar distance of 2.93 Å corresponds to the (111) plane; while, at 160 °C, the 5.72 and 3.73 Å distances correspond to the (010) and (011) surfaces, respectively. The surface energy decreases as follows:E(100)surf = 2.63 > E(111)surf = 1.23 > E(011)surf = 0.58 > E(010)surf = 0.26,
as shown in Fig. 8. Thus, the increasing temperature enhances the growth path in the direction of surfaces with lower energy values.
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy analysis
The optical band gap energy (Egap) of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals was calculated by the Wood–Tauc107 method and the Kubelka–Munk108 function. This methodology is based on the transformation of diffuse reflectance measurements to estimate the Egap values with high accuracy within the limits of certain assumptions when modeled in three dimensions. Assuming that ZnWO4 presents direct transitions between the valence (VB) and conduction (CB) bands,74,89,109–111 the Egap values for all the samples were calculated using n = 1.112,113 The Egap was obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of the (αhν)2versus hν plots of the UV-vis curves, according to the [αhν = A(hν − Egap)n/2]112,113 equation, where α is the absorption coefficient and hν is the photon energy.74,89,112,113
Fig. ESI-3 (ESI†) shows the UV-vis spectra for the ZnWO4 nanocrystals obtained by the MH method at 140, 150, and 160 °C and the corresponding Egap values are listed in Table 3.

Table 3 illustrates the experimental Egap values, showing a slight decrease in the values with the increasing temperature, showing a red shift of the absorption band edge.74,114 The relatively low Egap value obtained for ZnWO4 indicates a large number of structural defects generating allowed states between the VB and CB. The increase of the Egap values is linked to a reduction of the intermediary energy levels between the VB and CB by reducing the number of defects in local lattice distortions,89 since the optical band gap energy is controlled by the degree of structural order–disorder in the lattice.78

The study of the electronic levels in these nanocrystals can be achieved by theoretical calculations. The band structure of ZnWO4 is presented in Fig. 9(A), and it shows a direct band gap value of 3.85 eV located at the Y point of the Brillouin zone. This value is consistent with the experimental band gap value.
 Fig. 9  (A) Band structure of the ZnWO4 model. (B) Density of states projected in the ZnWO4 structure. 
Generally, a reduction of Egap can be achieved by temperature effects, by changing the synthetic method (thin films or powders), by introducing impurities in the lattice, by disordering the structure due to structural defects in the medium range, by local bond distortions78,115 in the [WO6]–[WO6], [ZnO6]–[ZnO6], or [WO6]–[ZnO6] clusters, by tuning the particle shape, size, intrinsic surface states and interfaces, etc.49 Thus, these factors can be directly associated with these electronic properties.

Fig. 9(B) shows the partial DOS projected on the Zn, W, and O atoms and the total DOS projected over all atoms in the ZnWO4 structure.
The analysis of the total DOS shows that the VB is predominantly composed of O atoms, while the partial DOS reports that this band is mainly formed by p-type orbitals (2px + 2py + 2pz and 3px + 3py + 3pz), of which a small portion are bonding orbitals for both Zn and W atoms. Most of these p-type orbitals are anti-bonding orbitals and the electrons present in these anti-bonding orbitals result in the polarization of both [ZnO6] and [WO6] clusters. Also, a minor contribution of the 3d and 4d orbitals is observed from the Zn and W atoms, respectively. The CB is mainly formed by W atoms with a minor contribution of the O 2p atoms. The partial DOS shows that the W orbitals are 4dxz + 4dyz + 4dxy and 4dz2 + 4dx2−y2, with higher contributions from the latter. The orbitals in the CB are mainly bonding orbitals, constituted by the hybridization of O 2p and W 4d orbitals.
This fact ensures that distortions in the [WO6] clusters generate intermediary levels in the forbidden zone between the VB and CB, narrowing the band gap. Distortions in the [ZnO6] clusters can also contribute by creating intermediate levels, although at a smaller scale.
Photoluminescence
PL is a physical process involving the electronic structure of the sample at medium range, which can be used to determine the defect density of ZnWO4 samples.80Fig. 10 shows the PL spectra of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals prepared by the MH method at 140, 150, and 160 °C under 350.7 nm excitation.
 Fig. 10  Emission spectra of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals obtained by the MH method at 140, 150 and 160 °C for 1 h; excited at 350.7 nm with a krypton ion laser. 

Fig. 10 shows the PL emission from 350 to 800 nm for all the samples, where broad band profiles can be observed, covering all of the visible spectrum with a maximum emission in the blue-green region at 515 nm.
The profile of the emission band is typical of a multiphonon process, where relaxation occurs by several paths involving several energy states within the band gap.116–118
According to the literature,41,52,74,119,120 the blue-green emission of ZnWO4 is linked to the intrinsic emission of WO66− complexes, where WO66− octahedra act as luminescence centers in the matrix and the charge transfer occurs between the O 2p orbitals and empty 4d W orbitals. On the other hand, the yellow-red emission has been found to be extrinsic and may be a defect-related emission.121 Consequently, this is linked to oxygen vacancies that are key in the formation of luminescence centers.
Previously, some of us118 have reported that the PL properties are directly connected to the structural order–disorder of the lattice, indicating that the intensity increase of the PL emission requires some simultaneous order–disorder in the system and that totally disordered or highly crystalline structures afford reduced PL emission.

Fig. 10 shows the temperature dependence of the PL emission, in which an increase of the luminescence intensity is observed for the samples prepared at 140 and 150 °C. For the sample synthesized at 160 °C, the opposite behavior is observed, that is, a reduction of the PL emission. These results are consistent with the XRD data and the literature data.118 However, the UV-vis analysis and PL experimental measurements indicate that significant changes in the band gap states occur when the system becomes more ordered (see Table 3 and Fig. 10).
The phenomenon of reduced luminescence intensity can be attributed to an increase in the number of superficial defects and non-radiative electron–hole recombination rates, consequently leading to the appearance of intermediate levels between the VB and CB.52 Moreover, a variety of factors can influence the luminescence intensity and appearance of intermediate levels within the forbidden band, such as the morphology, particle size, synthesis method, calcination temperature,52 and number of oxygen vacancies,122 among others.
After analyzing our experimental results, we concluded that the PL emission behavior is directly associated with structural defects (oxygen vacancies), as confirmed by the XRD and MR analyses (see Fig. 1 and Table S2 (ESI†), respectively). Thus, the oxygen vacancies induce luminescence quenching, and this fact is explained due to the increase in the concentration of defects causing lattice distortions and facilitating the expansion of the phonon spectrum, thereby increasing the non-radiative recombination due to electron–phonon interactions.120,122
For a better understanding of the PL properties and temperature dependence in the ZnWO4 lattice, the PL spectrum peaks were deconvoluted using the PickFit program with the Voigt area function, as shown in Fig. ESI-4 (ESI†).
Fig. ESI-4(A) (ESI†) shows the deconvolution of the PL spectra, which exhibit three curves in the blue (maximum at λ = 448 nm), green (maximum at λ = 503 nm), and yellow-red regions (maximum at λ = 574 nm), thus covering the visible electromagnetic spectrum. The features extracted from the deconvoluted curves and from the area under the respective transition curves are illustrated in Fig. ESI-4(B) (ESI†) confirming that the red component is the largest one.
To understand the PL emission, one must remember what was discussed in the previous section. The structure of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals became more stable upon increasing the synthesis temperature to 150 °C, affording wide-band PL emission. However, when the ZnWO4 structure reached temperature saturation (160 °C), a decline of the PL intensity was observed (see Fig. 10) induced by the stabilization of the (010) and (011) surfaces and, consequently, favoring the emission in the yellow-red region.118 This type of emission is related to oxygen vacancies located in the  and  clusters present in the (010) and (011) surfaces, inducing a new energy band gap region (higher wavelengths) at lower energies. According to Longo et al.,118 the oxygen vacancies inducing yellow and red emission are caused by deep defects in the lattice.
In this way, the reduced PL intensity of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals obtained at 160 °C is related to the oxygen vacancies present on the top of the surface of the structure and, consequently, the electronic levels are localized in the forbidden band gap and the Egap value decreases (see Table 3). Moreover, the PL behavior is related to the formation of oxygen vacancies, as illustrated in the following Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Formation of oxygen vacancy from cluster interactions. M = Zn and/or W atoms;  = neutral oxygen vacancy;  = positive oxygen vacancy. 
Oxygen vacancies can appear in different charge states in the disordered lattice, such as  and  or  and , where the vacancies donate electrons and are neutral in relation to the lattice (part (I) and (III) in the Scheme 1).  and  are singly ionized states and donate/capture electrons, and  and  are double-positively charged states in the lattice and capture electrons (part (II) in the Scheme 1). These oxygen vacancies induce the generation of new energy states in the band gap attributed to the [WO6] and [ZnO6] complex clusters.
Photocatalytic measurements
The promising photocatalytic activity of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals for the degradation of RhB was recently reported.46,123–126 Montine et al.127 compared the activity of the tungstates of divalent transition metals (MIIWO4, M = CoII, NiII, CuII, ZnII) for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO).
It was observed that the ZnWO4 photocatalytic activity was highly superior to that of the other investigated tungstates. The full d-orbitals hybridized (d10 configuration) with the W 4d states present in ZnWO4 affect the trapping of excitons, thus preventing electron–hole recombination and strongly enhancing the ability of this material to generate the radical species involved in the organic compound mineralization processes.
The PCA of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals synthesized at 140, 150, and 160 °C via the MH method was evaluated for RhB degradation in aqueous solution under UV irradiation. RhB absorbs light in the range of 200–600 nm, with a maximum at 554 nm. The temporal evolution of the absorption spectrum of the RhB aqueous solution in the presence of ZnWO4 nanocrystals synthesized at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen that the absorbance of RhB decreased quickly under UV irradiation with irradiation time, and the absorption peak at 554 nm completely disappeared after irradiation in the presence of the ZnWO4 catalysts (see Fig. 11(A)). This decay occurs because the conjugated chromophore of RhB (a xanthene ring) undergoes a gradual de-ethylation process of the N,N′-diethylammonium functional groups, causing a hypochromic displacement of the absorption.128
 Fig. 11  (A) UV-vis absorption spectra of the RhB aqueous solution in the presence of ZnWO4 nanocrystals, obtained by the MH method at 140, 150 and 160 °C for 1 h and in the presence of pure RhB. (B) Relative concentration of RhB dye (C/C0) versus time (min) of ZnWO4 nanocrystals, prepared at different temperatures. (C) Reaction kinetics of RhB degradation −ln(C0/C) versus time (min) for the ZnWO4 nanocrystals prepared at different temperatures. 

Fig. 11(B) compares the changes in the relative concentration of RhB with the irradiation time using ZnWO4 nanocrystals prepared at different temperatures. No obvious degradation of pure RhB was observed, indicating that the dye is barely degraded by UV light. The degradation efficiency of RhB increased with the increasing synthesis temperature; the efficiency reached 100% after 40 min of irradiation for the ZnWO4 nanocrystals prepared at 160 °C. In contrast, the photocatalytic activity of the samples obtained at 150 and 140 °C was 100% after 50 and 70 min of irradiation, respectively. This indicates that the crystallinity of the ZnWO4 nanocrystal semiconductors plays an important role in the RhB photodegradation efficiency.
Generally, the dependence of the photocatalytic reaction rate on the concentration of an organic dye is well described by the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) model:129,130 (3)where r is the reaction rate (mg L−1 min−1), k is the specific reaction rate constant (mg L−1 min−1), K is the adsorption coefficient (L mg−1), and C is the concentration of the dye at time t (mg L−1). When the initial dye concentration is low (C0 is small), the above equation can be simplified to a pseudo-first-order equation: ln(C0/C) = kKt = Kappt(4)
To understand the reaction kinetics of RhB degradation in our experiments, plots of −ln(C0/C) versus irradiation time for the ZnWO4 nanocrystals synthesized at 140, 150, and 160 °C were constructed, as shown in Fig. 11(C). The rate constants obtained from the regression lines are shown also in Fig. 11(C). A fairly good correlation to the pseudo-first-order equation was observed, indicating that this reaction follows pseudo-first-order kinetics. The ZnWO4 sample synthesized at 160 °C showed the highest k value, corresponding to the best photocatalytic activity.
As discussed in the PL analysis, in ZnWO4, there are two different clusters in the structure  and the [MO6] clusters (where M = Zn and/or W) form the electron–hole pair, as shown in Scheme 1. In the photodegradation of RhB by ZnWO4, the following photo-oxidation mechanism was proposed, in which the  clusters (hole species) located on the top of the surface of the nanocrystals interact with the water forming the hydroxyl radical (OH*) and proton (H˙) reactive species, while the  clusters (electron species) located inside the structure interact with O2 generating the superoxide . The H˙ species are unstable and quickly interact with  forming the perhydroxyl radicals (O2H*). Next, RhB is degraded by the OH* and O2H* radicals producing colorless compounds organic (CCO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O), as shown in Scheme 2.
 Scheme 2  Proposed mechanism of photodegradation of RhB dye in CCO, CO2 and H2O, in the presence of ZnWO4 nanocrystals. 
However, as proposed in the literature, the active species are: holes, electrons, OH*, O2H* and , and their corresponding activities were investigated using different types of active species scavengers.131–134Fig. 12 shows the percentage of degradation of RhB after 60 min of exposure to UV-vis radiation in function of the scavengers action of reactive species.
 Fig. 12  Percentage of degradation (%) of RhB dye under exposure to UV-vis radiation, in the presence of ZnWO4 nanocrystals and different scavengers. 
As shown in Fig. 12, when AgNO3, which is an electron scavenger, was added to the reaction mixture, the degradation reached 100% after 20 min of irradiation. By preventing the recombination using AgNO3, the highly oxidizing VB holes are able to oxidize water, making available a higher quantity of holes for this oxidation.135
When the hydroxyl radical scavenger tetrabutylammonium (TBA) was added, the rate of degradation of RhB was considerably reduced. This suggests that OH* radicals participate in the degradation of RhB along with other oxidative radical species. Addition of the superoxide radical scavenger benzoquinone (BQ) also decreases the degradation rate of RhB. This shows that some  species are also present in the equilibrium.136
When ammonium oxalate (AO), often used as a hole capturer, was added to the reaction system, the degradation process was inhibited because the ZnWO4 holes could not interact with the water to generate the active species. Thus, it was concluded that the presence of holes is a limiting factor in the photocatalytic activity as well as in the degradation rate.
According to the DOS analysis (see Fig. 9(B)), the differences in the hybridization of the W, Zn, and O atoms and the different coordination numbers of the Zn and W clusters can generate intermediary energy levels (or “defects”) located between the VB and CB. When these defects polarize the lattice, transitions between the clusters can occur. Therefore, the UV light is absorbed and polarization processes occur.
In an ideal structure, each atom is perfectly located in a site; however, this does not happen in nature. Thus, it is possible to find  clusters located on the top of the surface and  located inside the nanocrystals.
According to the proposed photocatalytic mechanism, the defects play a crucial role in the production of OH* and O2H* radicals, which are the main active species for the degradation of RhB.
The sample prepared at 160 °C exhibited the best photocatalytic activity, and thus we propose that the formation of the active species OH*, H˙, and  must be associated with the type of surface stabilized in the material. As shown previously, at 160 °C, the (010) and (011) surfaces were observed, containing vacancies associated with the clusters of  and , respectively. As only the structure obtained at 160 °C contains  clusters at the top of the surface, this type of cluster must be the most efficient for the generation of active species for RhB photodegradation, making it a superior catalyst over the samples synthesized at lower temperatures.
Conclusions
In summary, ZnWO4 nanocrystals were successfully synthesized by the MH method and, for the first time, the effect of temperature on the crystal structure, morphology, and optical properties was investigated. First-principles calculations at the density functional theory level provided an in-depth understanding of the electronic and structural properties of ZnWO4. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: (i) The XRD patterns and Rietveld refinement data showed that ZnWO4 nanocrystals are monophasic with a monoclinic structure of the wolframite type. (ii) MR and FT-IR spectroscopies were employed to verify the vibrational modes and the results confirmed that all the vibrational modes are characteristic of a monoclinic structure. The theoretical values of the Raman spectra are consistent with previously reported experimental values. (iii) The FE-SEM images revealed that the synthesis temperature influences the shape and size of the ZnWO4 nanocrystals, showing an undefined morphology at 140 °C, while defined polyhedral (e.g., nanorods), rectangular, and hexagonal plates were observed in the sample prepared at 160 °C. (iv) The Wulff construction method was employed to obtain the morphologies and their transformations. The surface energy of each facet depended on the temperature; thus, less energetic surfaces were stabilized with increasing temperature. (v) The UV-vis spectra revealed direct transitions between the VB and CB. The theoretical values of the UV-vis spectra are in agreement with the experimental results. (vi) The PL behavior of the ZnWO4 samples is associated with oxygen vacancies , which cause a red shift related to an increase of deep defects. (vii) Finally, it was concluded that the photocatalytic activity of the ZnWO4 nanoparticles is controlled by the number of holes in the structure and the sample prepared at 160 °C exhibits the best photocatalytic activity.
This experimental and theoretical work provides insights into the fine effects of the synthesis temperature on the morphology and photoluminescence properties of ZnWO4 nanocrystals, as well as the role of the electronic structure on their photocatalytic activity.
