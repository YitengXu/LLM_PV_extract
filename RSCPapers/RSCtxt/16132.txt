    , Accepted 22nd August 2022First published on 24th August 2022AbstractFirst-principles calculations are carried out to investigate the structural, electronic, and optical properties of CsGeCl3. The results indicate that CsGeCl3 undergoes three structural phase transitions from Cm or R3m to Pmm at 8.5 GPa, from Pmm to ppPv-Pnma at 9.4 GPa, and from ppPv-Pnma to I4mm at 64 GPa, respectively. Meanwhile, the relation between the band gap and pressure implies that the band gap value of ppPv-Pnma is 1.56 eV at 40 GPa, making it a potential photovoltaic material. Based on pressure-induced stable structures, the CsGeCl3 quantum dots (QDs) have been fabricated to investigate the excited-state properties by tuning ultrafast laser pulses based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The excited-state properties show that CsGeCl3 QDs have a wider absorption range compared with their bulk materials and their optical responses can be regulated by changing the laser intensity and wavelength. Our results further reveal that the R3m-QDs exhibit excellent optical performance and have potential applications in optoelectronic devices.
1 Introduction
Halide perovskites have recently received broad attention for solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and other applications on account of their extraordinary properties, such as a tunable bandgap, a high absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, low cost, facile synthesis, and so on.1–11 Among these halide perovskites, lead halide perovskites exhibit outstanding performance as promising photovoltaic materials for solar cells with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5%.12 However, the toxicity of lead has hindered its further development. Finding novel lead-free perovskite materials is the key to addressing this issue. Considering that the radius and electronic characteristics (lone-pair s and inactive p orbitals) of Ge (germanium) or Sn (tin) element are similar to Pb, germanium halide perovskites and tin halide perovskites may be a better choice. However, Sn is unstable and easily oxidized from Sn2+ to Sn4+, the theoretical and experimental studies have paid close attention to Ge-based perovskites. Ge-based perovskites (CsGeX3 (X = Cl, Br, I)) possess the maximum absorption and higher optical conductivity compared to other metal cation (Sn, Pb)-based perovskites, implying that they possess superior optical properties to Sn or Pb-based perovskites.13 Regrettably, CsGeX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have huge band gap values of 3.67 eV, 2.32 eV, and 1.60 eV, respectively, indicating that CsGeCl3 and CsGeBr3 are not beneficial to high-efficiency solar cell applications and other photovoltaic performance.14,15 Even though the band gap of CsGeI3 is close to that of CH3NH3PbI3 (the predicted PCE is up to 33%), its PCE in the experiment is only 3.2%.16,17 Hence, to improve the PCE of perovskites, Rahaman et al. carried out the doping metal in CsGeCl3 to enhance the absorbance and photoconductivity.18 Liu et al. discovered an appropriate band gap (1.36 eV) of CsGeI3 to meet the needs of the photovoltaic applications by applying strain.19 Of course, pressure can also be an effective way to obtain an appropriate band gap and excellent optical performance. Gao et al. found that CsGeI3 has a higher absorption coefficient and a narrow band gap under hydrostatic pressure, and can be useful for solar cells as the absorption layer.20 Moreover, in the experiments and theories, Schwarz et al. and Seo et al. reported the pressure effect on the band gap of CsGeCl3.14,21 Most of those studies are largely focused on the rhombohedral structure (R3m) and cubic structure (Pmm) of CsGeCl3. Moreover, Wang et al. investigated the structural evolution of CsPbCl3 under pressure; some complex phases C2/m, Cmcm, ppPv-Pnma, and Pnma have appeared under high pressure.22 Up to now, only phase transition from the R3m structure to the cubic Pmm structure near 3 GPa at room temperature has been reported for CsGeCl3, and the high pressure induced phases of CsGeCl3 have rarely been involved.14
Of course, the effect of dimensions on properties cannot be ignored. Zero dimensional perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have attracted widespread attention in both theoretical and experimental investigations, which have been widely used in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), advanced lasers, solar cells, and photon detection due to their outstanding properties, such as a wide absorption range, adjustable emission wavelength, facile synthesis, and high photoluminescence quantum yields.23–25 In particular, in 2015, Protesescu et al. successfully synthesized perovskite QDs CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) with a size in the range of 4–15 nm, exhibiting high quantum yields of up to 90% and broadly tunable photoluminescence.26 Meanwhile, QDs are usually very tiny at the nanometer scale and have a unique quantum size effect which makes them show outstanding optical properties compared with their bulk materials. Recently, Lin et al. found that BaTiO3 perovskite QDs have an insulator–metal transition by breaking the bonds of the Ba–O atoms by tuning the ultrafast laser.27 Moreover, the effects of pressure and ultrafast laser on the oxygen perovskite QDs have been investigated based on the simple ground-state structures and pressure-induced complex structures (i.e. pPv-Cmcm, ppPv-Pnma, and so on).28,29 However, for halide perovskite QDs, CsGeI3 colloidal nanocrystals have been successfully synthesized with the R3m phase, and a host of investigations are mainly focused on the ground-state structures.30,31 Regrettably, the investigations of CsGeCl3 QDs are rarely reported. Therefore, we explore the optical properties of CsGeCl3 QDs under pressure-induced stable structures.
In this paper, Section 2 describes the computational details of the density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) methods. Then, we explore the high pressure-induced phase transitions (in Section 3.1), and electronic properties (in Section 3.2) of CsGeCl3. In addition, Section 3.3 illustrates the optical response with the ultrafast laser in CsGeCl3 QDs based on TDDFT. Moreover, Section 3.4 discusses the influence of different laser intensities and wavelengths on CsGeCl3 QDs. Finally, in Section 4, we draw conclusions from our results.
2 Computational methods
2.1 Bulk structures calculations using the DFT method
In this work, the first-principles calculations are based on DFT by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).32–34 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof revised for solids (PBEsol) exchange–correlation potential is employed in our calculations.35 Correspondingly, Cs 5s25p66s1, Ge 4s24p2 and Cl 3s23p5 electrons are treated as valence electrons, respectively. The Brillouin zone sampling with k meshes of 0.15 Å−1 and the plane-wave cutoff energy of 550 eV are selected. Meanwhile, the forces are less than 0.001 eV Å−1 for each atom. Then, the enthalpy using the following equation ΔH = E + PV (where E is the total internal energy, P is the hydrostatic pressure, and V is the volume) is computed. Besides, to obtain a more reliable band gap, the electronic properties of CsGeCl3 have been investigated based on the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional.36,37 The optical properties of bulk CsGeCl3 structures determined by the dielectric function ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω) are performed using the PBEsol functional. Correspondingly, the absorption coefficient is obtained by the dielectric function using the following equation:38,39 (1)where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) represent real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively. Moreover, the space group of different crystal structures is identified using the FINDSYM program.40
2.2 CsGeCl3 QDs calculations from the TDDFT method
For CsGeCl3 QDs, our calculations are implemented in the OCTOPUS code using the real-space and real-time TDDFT approach.41 The time-dependent Kohn–Sham equation is (2)where VKS(r,t) and  are the Kohn–Sham potential and the kinetic energy, respectively. The system is excited by a functional impulse to obtain the optical absorption spectrum which can be represented by the dipole strength function S(ω) and its relationship with the dynamic polarizability α(ω) is (3)
The Gaussian wave packet is used to simulate the ultrafast laser and the formulas are as follows: f(x)cos[ωt + ϕ(t)]g(t)(4) g(t) = G0exp[−(t − t0)2/2τ02](5)where f(x), ω and ϕ(t) represent the laser polarized in the x-direction, the laser wavelengths, and the initial phases of the laser fields, respectively. The g(t) function describes the waveform of the ultrafast laser and the amplitude G0 is the maximum electric field intensity.
The Hartwigsen–Goedecker–Hutter pseudopotential is used to describe the cesium, germanium, and chlorine atoms in CsGeCl3 QDs. Meanwhile, the GGA and PBE functionals for the exchange–correlation are used in both the ground-state and excited-state calculations. The simulation zone is defined by a 6 Å radius sphere around each atom and a uniform mesh grid of 0.3 Å. For the optical absorption spectrum, the Kohn–Sham wave functions with time evolution are evolved for 6000 steps and a step of 0.003 ħ eV−1 is set. Meanwhile, for time evolution with external laser pulses, a time step of 0.0033 fs is chosen. Moreover, the different structures are drawn by the visualization software VESTA.42
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structural phase transition
In order to investigate the phase transition of CsGeCl3, we calculate the enthalpies for different phases within the pressure range of 0–100 GPa. The enthalpy ΔH = E + PV as a function of pressure for different phases is plotted in Fig. 1. The predicted schematization of stable crystal structures for CsGeCl3 is depicted in Fig. 2 and the corresponding structural parameters are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† At 0 GPa, the calculated results indicate that the enthalpies of Cm and R3m are −9.142801 eV f.u.−1 and −9.142867 eV f.u.−1, respectively, that is to say, the enthalpy of the Cm structure is almost equal to that of R3m structure. Meanwhile, Fig. 1 indicates that the enthalpies of R3m and Cm are lower than those of other phases for CsGeCl3, further implying that the ground state of CsGeCl3 is the coexistence of R3m and Cm. Certainly, the R3m of CsGeCl3 has been reported in both theoretical and experimental investigations.14,21,43–47 However, up to now, no related report of the Cm has been found in CsGeCl3. Table S1 (ESI†) also shows that the lattice parameters of the trigonal R3m (No. 160) structure pictured in Fig. 2(a) are a = b = 7.4625 Å, c = 9.1906 Å, which are in good agreement with the experimental measurements47a = b = 7.666 Å, c = 9.458 Å. And the lattice parameters of the monoclinic Cm (No. 8) structure as shown in Fig. 2(b) are a = 7.4907 Å, b = 7.4619 Å, c = 5.2887 Å, and α = 90°, β = 89.6633°, γ = 90°. Of course, the phonon dispersions of Cm and R3m structures at 0 GPa indicate that their phonon frequencies (seen in Fig. S1 (ESI†)) are not negative, further verifying that they are all dynamically stable.

Let us turn to Fig. 1. It can be seen that the phase transition occurs with the pressure increasing. When the pressure is above 8.5 GPa, the enthalpy of the Pmm structure (see Fig. 2(c)) is slightly lower than that of the R3m and Cm structures, implying the transition from the R3m or Cm structure to the Pmm structure at about 8.5 GPa. The Pmm structure has been verified from experiments in a previous report near 3 GPa at room temperature,14 and lattice constants a = b = c = 4.8976 Å are obtained as seen in Table S1 (ESI†). The difference in the pressure critical point of Pmm between our calculations and experimental results may originate from the temperature effect. From Fig. 1, we also find that, at about 9.4 GPa, CsGeCl3 experiences a phase transition from cubic Pmm to orthorhombic Pnma with lattice parameters of a = 7.8253 Å, b = 3.1454 Å, and c = 13.7519 Å. For the Pnma structure, one can see that the distinction of the Pnma structure is according to the combination modes of different octahedra.48 As seen in Fig. 2(d), one finds that the Pnma structure in this paper is the edge sharing between octahedrons similar to previous reports called post-post-perovskite (ppPv-Pnma).22,49 Here, we also employ the ppPv-Pnma to identify the Pnma structure in this paper. With the pressure increasing up to 64 GPa, the ppPv-Pnma structure transforms into I4mm structure with lattice parameters of a = b = 3.0417 Å, and c = 14.2074 Å seen in Fig. 2(e). For the I4mm structure, Huang et al. have reported that the I4mm structure in RbPbCl3 appears at 20 GPa.50 But it has not been reported in CsGeCl3.
From what has been discussed above, one can see that, when the pressure from 0 up to 100 GPa, CsGeCl3 undergoes three structural phase transitions, i.e. from Cm or R3m to Pmm at 8.5 GPa, from Pmm to ppPv-Pnma at 9.4 GPa, and from ppPv-Pnma to I4mm at 64 GPa. Meanwhile, the volume as a function of pressure for different structures is plotted in Fig. S2 (ESI†), implying that these phase transitions are first-order phase transitions. In order to demonstrate the dynamical stability of the predicted structures, the phonon dispersions of the Pmm structure at 9 GPa, the ppPv-Pnma structure at 40 GPa, and the I4mm structure at 100 GPa are implemented in the PHONOPY code51 and shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), respectively. These structures have no negative phonon frequencies which indicate that they are all dynamically stable.
3.2 Electronic properties
Due to the sensitivity of the band gap to pressure, the band gap can be manipulated by applying pressure to facilitate applications in photovoltaics and optoelectronics. In this part, we investigate the variation of the band gap of CsGeCl3 under different pressures, the relations between the band gap and pressure are plotted in Fig. 3(a). At 0 GPa, as shown in Fig. 3(a), the R3m structure is a direct band gap semiconductor with the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) at the A-point of the Brillouin zone. The calculated band gap is 1.9343 eV, which is slightly less than the evaluated value of 2.22 eV by Walters et al.46 For the Cm structure, the direct band gap with the VBM and CBM at the Z-point is 1.9360 eV at 0 GPa, which is almost equal to the R3m structure. Both the band gaps of Cm and R3m structures are smaller than the experimentally evaluated value of 3.67 eV.14,21 Even if we employ other functionals or consider the spin–orbit coupling effect, we still do not eliminate this difference. However, at 8.5–9.4 GPa, as shown in Fig. 3(a), the Pmm structure is the most stable and the direct band gap is 0 eV at the R-point; that is to say, CsGeCl3 undergoes a structural phase transition from R3m or Cm to Pmm and at the same time undergoes a transition from semiconductor to metal. Of course, the Pmm structure of CsGeCl3 being metal is in good agreement with Islam et al.'s work which demonstrates the metal state of the Pmm structure of CsGeCl3 at 8–10 GPa.52 From 0 to 9.4 GPa, as the phase transition occurs, the band gap of CsGeCl3 decreases and consequently vanishes with the pressure increasing, realizing the semiconductor to metal transition as shown in Fig. 3(a). Meanwhile, at a pressure of 9.4 GPa, the ppPv-Pnma structure is an indirect band gap semiconductor. From Pmm to ppPv-Pnma, CsGeCl3 undergoes a metal to semiconductor transition. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the band gap of the ppPv-Pnma structure decreases from 3.77 to 0.57 eV as the pressure increases from 9.4 to 64 GPa. Moreover, at 40 GPa, the ppPv-Pnma structure with an indirect band gap of 1.56 eV appears, which makes it a potential material for photovoltaic applications. Meanwhile, Fig. 3(a) also shows that narrowing the band gap of the ppPv-Pnma structure in the range of 1.2–1.4 eV can be realized at pressures of 40–60 GPa, which can further improve the photovoltaic performance of GsGeCl3. In other words, by applying pressure, a narrow band gap can be realized to obtain a high PCE for solar cells. Then, when the pressure is from 64 to 100 GPa, Fig. 3(a) indicates that the I4mm structure is more stable with an indirect band gap and the band gap also decreases from 2.97 to 2.06 eV with pressure increasing. By comparison, the band gap of the I4mm structure decreases more slowly. Consequently, CsGeCl3 can not only decrease the band gap to gain a suitable value for solar cells, but also realize the semiconductor–metal and metal–semiconductor transitions by tuning the pressure.
 Fig. 3  (a) Calculated band gaps of CsGeCl3 as a function of pressure by using the HSE06 hybrid functional. The total and partial density of states (DOS) of CsGeCl3 under pressure for (b) R3m (0 GPa), (c) Cm (0 GPa), (d) Pmm (9 GPa), (e and f) ppPv-Pnma (20 and 60 GPa), and (g and h) I4mm (80 and 100 GPa), respectively. 
To further understand the pressure effect on the band gap of CsGeCl3, the total and partial densities of states of CsGeCl3 at a certain pressure are figured out and the result is shown in Fig. 3(b)–(h). For the R3m structure (seen in Fig. 3(b)), the conduction band near the Fermi level mainly comes from the Ge 4p orbital at 0 GPa, whereas the valence band near the Fermi level is dominated by Ge 4s and Cl 3p orbitals. Similarly, for the Cm structure (seen in Fig. 3(c)), the contribution of orbital in the valence band and conduction band is similar to the R3m structure. For the Pmm structure (seen in Fig. 3(d)), at 9 GPa, the conduction band mainly comes from the Ge 4p orbital, and the valence band largely consists of Cl 3p and Ge 4s orbitals, which is also similar to R3m and Cm structures. However, for the ppPv-Pnma structure seen in Fig. 3(e) and (f), the valence band near the Fermi level is largely composed of Cl 3p and Ge 4s orbitals. The states in the conduction band near the Fermi level are mainly contributed by Cl 3p and Ge 4p, which is different from the aforementioned structures. Fig. 3(e) and (f) clearly show that under 20 and 60 GPa, Cl 3p and Ge 4p orbitals in the conduction band move close to the Fermi level and thus result in a decrease of the band gap under the increasing pressure. For the I4mm structure shown in Fig. 3(g) and (h), the conduction band near the Fermi level is mainly contributed by Cl 3p and Ge 4p orbitals. The valence band near the Fermi level is mainly contributed by Cl 3p and Ge 4s orbitals with a small contribution of the Cs 5p orbital, which is slightly different from the ppPv-Pnma structure. Through the analysis of DOS (seen in Fig. 3(g) and (h)), it can be found that the DOS value near the Fermi level decreases with the pressure increasing from 80 to 100 GPa leading to the decrease of the band gap. However, as shown in Fig. 3(a), we can find that there are two sharp increases in the band gap at the phase transitions from Pmm to ppPv-Pnma and from ppPv-Pnma to I4mm, respectively. The reason for the first sharp increase of the band gap by analyzing Fig. 3(d) and (e) is that the Cl 3p and Ge 4s orbitals in the valence band and the Ge 4p orbital in the conduction band are an upshift, and the Cl 3p orbital in the conduction band emerges. For the second sharp increase of the band gap, analyzing Fig. 3(f) and (g), we can find that the Cl 3p and Ge 4p orbitals in the conduction band near the Fermi level narrow the energy range leading to a sharp increase in the band gap. However, from R3m or Cm to Pmm (seen in Fig. 3(b)–(d)), there isn't a sharp increase, which is because their main contribution orbitals both in the conduction band and the valence band near the Fermi level are the same.
3.3 Optical responses under the certain ultrafast laser in CsGeCl3 QDs
QDs have better optical performance than bulk materials due to their unique quantum size effect. Apparently, the atomic number has a direct effect on optical absorption. Therefore, based on the pressure-induced stable structures, we design the four CsGeCl3 QDs (R3m-QDs, Cm-QDs, ppPv-Pnma-QDs, and I4mm-QDs) with an approximately equal number of atoms, as presented in Fig. 4(a)–(d), similar to the previous studies.29Fig. 4(a)–(d) show the detailed information of the four kinds of CsGeCl3 QDs including length (L), width (W), and height (H), and all of them contain approximately 120 atoms. First, QDs are calculated using DFT to obtain the ground-state information, such as energies and density of states (DOS) plotted in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The obtained DOS (Fig. S3, ESI†) indicates that the four CsGeCl3 QDs are all insulators. Next, we explore the optical absorption properties of CsGeCl3 QDs by calculating the linear optical responses; a delta perturbation with the strength of 0.05 eV Å−1 is employed in the excited-state calculations to obtain the optical responses based on the TDDFT, as shown in Fig. 5(a). Compared with their bulk materials (see Fig. S4 (ESI†)), the optical absorption of CsGeCl3 QDs appears redshifted and broadens the absorption range. This phenomenon may be attributed to the reduced threshold of light absorption induced by the quantum size effect, which results in the absorption spectrum shifting toward the lower energy region. What's more, Fig. 5(a) also indicates that the absorption edge of the other three CsGeCl3 QDs (R3m-QDs, ppPv-Pnma-QDs, and I4mm-QDs) is wider in the low energy region than that of Cm-QDs, indicating that three CsGeCl3 QDs have better optical properties than Cm-QDs.
 Fig. 4  Side and top view of (a) R3m-QDs, (b) Cm-QDs, (c) ppPv-Pnma-QDs, and (d) I4mm-QDs with the detailed information including length (L), width (W), and height (H). The QDs are fabricated based on the pressure-induced stable structures of CsGeCl3 which are R3m (0 GPa), Cm (0 GPa), ppPv-Pnma (40 GPa), and I4mm (100 GPa), respectively. 
 Fig. 5  (a) The optical absorption of R3m-QDs, Cm-QDs, ppPv-Pnma-QDs, and I4mm-QDs with a delta perturbation of the strength of 0.05 eV Å−1, respectively. The impulse polarizes along the x-direction and along the center of the QDs. (b) The Gaussian laser oscillograph with the intensity of 2.0 eV Å−1 and 792 nm wavelength, the ultrafast laser pulse also polarizes along the x-direction. (c) The highest electron level (HEL) and (d) the number of electrons across the Fermi surface (NF) in R3m-QDs, Cm-QDs, ppPv-Pnma-QDs, and I4mm-QDs, respectively. 
In order to further understand the electron transition behavior of the QDs under external laser pulses, we calculate the excited state to investigate the changes in the electron occupied state. The wavelength of 792 nm is employed for ultrafast laser with the intensity of 2.0 eV Å−1, which has been widely used in previous studies,27,53 as shown in Fig. 5(b). Since electrons in the QDs can absorb photons and thus lead to the changes in the electron occupied state, we investigate the changes of the highest electron level (HEL) and the number of electrons passing through the Fermi surface (NF) of the four QDs during the time evolution. The HEL and NF can be obtained from the excited-state DOS date. Fig. 5(c) clearly indicates that R3m-QDs have a higher HEL value than the other three CsGeCl3 QDs (Cm-QDs, ppPv-Pnma-QDs, and I4mm-QDs) at about 2.48 fs, implying that R3m-QDs have a better optical response. A higher value of the HEL means a stronger ability for the electrons passing through the Fermi surface. In conjunction with the electronic properties of the bulk CsGeCl3, we can find that although ppPv-Pnma bulk structure at 40 GPa possesses a better band gap value compared to R3m bulk structure, R3m-QDs have better optical responses than ppPv-Pnma-QDs. This may be because the R3m bulk structure possesses a direct band gap. As we know, the excitation process of an electron from the valence band to the conduction band could create the phonon that may induce the heating effect for indirect band gap resulting in its optical performance inferior to the direct band gap. Thus, we think that the reason why the R3m-QDs exhibit a better optical response may be related to the direct band gap of their bulk structure. Of course, the optical responses of four QDs can also be analyzed by the NF value seen in Fig. 5(d). From Fig. 5(d), we can see that R3m-QDs possess more electrons above the Fermi surface and exhibit a better optical response, which is consistent with the results of the HEL.
3.4 Optical properties regulated by ultrafast laser for CsGeCl3 QDs
To further explore the optical absorption performance of CsGeCl3 QDs, we choose the three QDs (R3m-QDs, Cm-QDs, and ppPv-Pnma-QDs) with excellent optical response performance to investigate the influence of ultrafast laser intensities and wavelengths on the QDs. Here, the 792 nm wavelength lasers with different intensities from 0.5 to 2.5 eV Å−1 with an interval of 0.5 eV Å−1 are employed for the three QDs seen in Fig. 6(a). Fig. 6(b)–(d) present the variation tendency of the HEL values vs. ultrafast laser intensity. From Fig. 6(b)–(d), one can see that the HEL value increases with the increasing intensity in these QDs. Thus, the optical response in CsGeCl3 QDs can be regulated by controlling the laser intensity. Meanwhile, we can also find that the HEL of the R3m-QDs is the highest at about 2.48 fs; that is to say, the R3m-QDs have superior optical responses compared to the other two CsGeCl3 QDs. As also revealed by Fig. 6(b), the HEL of the R3m-QDs is higher than 0 eV under ultrafast lasers with the intensity range of 1.0–2.5 eV Å−1, while a lower intensity laser like 0.5 eV Å−1, the HEL is lower than 0 eV. For Cm-QDs, as shown in Fig. 6(c), the results are similar to R3m-QDs. However, for ppPv-Pnma-QDs (see Fig. 6(d)), the HEL is lower than 0 eV under the laser intensities of 0.5 and 1.0 eV Å−1. Therefore, the higher HEL values of R3m-QDs and Cm-QDs imply their better optical responses.
 Fig. 6  (a) The laser oscillograph, (b)–(d) the HEL in R3m-QDs, Cm-QDs, and ppPv-Pnma-QDs with the different intensities from 0.5 to 2.5 eV Å−1 with an interval of 0.5 eV Å−1 and the wavelength of the ultrafast laser is 792 nm, respectively. 
Let us turn to the effect of laser wavelength on the optical properties. Perovskite QDs can possess different optical absorption abilities under various wavelength lasers. Here, a wide range of laser wavelengths, 355, 476, 531, 654, and 792 nm, which are frequently employed in experiments and theories,27 as well as the intensity of 1.5 eV Å−1 are selected shown in Fig. S5(a) (ESI†). Correspondingly, the HEL values of R3m-QDs, Cm-QDs, and ppPv-Pnma-QDs with various wavelengths of lasers and the intensity of 1.5 eV Å−1 are plotted in Fig. S5(b)–(d) (ESI†). As shown in Fig. S5(b)–(d) (ESI†), the HEL values of the three QDs are all higher than 0 eV under 355–792 nm wavelength lasers, which indicates that the three CsGeCl3 QDs can possess better optical responses under a wide range of wavelength lasers. Moreover, we find that the HEL values change very little with the laser wavelength variation, further implying the laser intensities have a greater influence on the HEL values of three QDs than the laser wavelengths. Interestingly, we also notice that there is an unconventionally large value of the HEL for the three CsGeCl3 QDs under the 792 nm wavelength laser. It may be due to the wavelength of 792 nm being close to the intrinsic frequency of the three CsGeCl3 QDs, which makes photocarriers achieve higher resonance energy.27,28,53
4 Conclusions
The structural phase transitions of CsGeCl3 have been investigated comprehensively by means of DFT under a high pressure of 0–100 GPa. The calculated results indicate that, unlike previous studies, besides the R3m phase, the other ground-state phase Cm has been obtained, i.e., the ground states of CsGeCl3 are the coexistence of R3m and Cm phases. Meanwhile, with the pressure increasing, the Pmm phase is obtained at 8.5 GPa and two new phases (ppPv-pnma and I4mm) in CsGeCl3 appear at about 9.4 GPa and 64 GPa, respectively. Moreover, the band gap values of those stable phases imply that ppPv-Pnma is a potential photovoltaic material due to its band gap value of 1.56 eV at 40 GPa. Subsequently, the synergistic effect of pressure and ultrafast laser on the optical properties of CsGeCl3 QDs is investigated based on TDDFT. Due to the quantum size effect, the absorption spectrum of CsGeCl3 QDs shows a wider absorption range compared with their bulk materials. Through tuning the laser intensity and wavelength, CsGeCl3 QDs can obtain better optical responses. Compared with the other three QDs, the R3m-QDs have outstanding optical responses. Our study may provide a direction for the application of perovskite QDs.
