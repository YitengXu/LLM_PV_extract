    , Accepted 18th May 2023First published on 19th May 2023AbstractSolid adsorbents are considered very attractive for selective CO2 removal from main emission sites, and this method was found suitable for post-combustion carbon capture owing to its cost-effective and retrofit nature. Among various solid adsorbents contested for CO2 adsorption, biomass-derived porous carbons (BPCs) have emerged as an important class due to their unique characteristics, for instance, remarkable textural features, less expensive and abundant precursors, surface chemistry, and tunable porosity, and therefore are considered appropriate for CO2 capture under diverse conditions. Different synthetic strategies have been employed to produce suitable textural as well as physicochemical properties in BPCs to effectively use them for CO2 adsorption applications. In this review, we have comprehensively discussed the origin and compositional analysis of biomass, its conversion strategies (e.g., pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, physical or chemical activation, and sol–gel process), non-functionalized and functionalized BPCs as CO2 adsorbents, the role of heteroatom, for instance, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur on BPC's textural features and CO2 adsorption performance, the mechanism behind CO2 capture (either physisorption or chemisorption), a brief note on the main approaches for CO2 capture (e.g., pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxy-combustion), leading factors that could influence the CO2 adsorption performance of BPCs (role of higher carbon content, processing temperature and time, activating agent and impregnation ratio, etc.), and current major challenges. Finally, a summary is provided that discusses concluding remarks and future research directions with possible solutions for the effective development of BPCs to seek excellent CO2 capture and conversion applications.
1. Introduction
With the industrial revolution, the consumption of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) has drastically increased to meet the energy demands of a sustainable society. Driven by the large consumption of fossil fuels, global environmental issues are being attributed to the elevated levels of atmospheric CO2.1,2 Of note, the CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels have reached an alarming level which is beyond the Earth's capacity to capture and fix carbon using natural carbon cycles.3 The potential adverse effects of increased CO2 levels are global warming, an increased global temperature, climate change, and acidification of oceans, thereby threatening sustainable ecosystems.4 These hazardous effects of greenhouse gas (CO2) are increasing too rapidly to ignore and possibly too advanced to reckon with. Regardless of the primary cause of CO2, scientific communities and environmentalists are directing their research efforts to mitigate CO2 levels in an economically viable manner by designing different materials for effective CO2 capture and storage (CCS).5,6 In this regard, Global Climate Change Initiatives including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the United Nations Framework Convention have been established for CO2 mitigation.7,8 They suggested possible pathways to reduce global CO2 levels by innovating methods for CCS, using renewable energy sources, substituting fossil fuels with carbon-free fuels, increasing the capacities of biological sinks, and so on.9 Focusing on CCS, it is accepted as an economically unfavorable approach10 and has limitations in the practical applications of carbon capture; therefore, designing cheap and effective CO2 adsorbent materials for mitigating global warming is essential.
Recently, research in carbon materials has demonstrated an emerging class of high-performing materials with tunable structures and heterogeneous surface chemistry by realizing the potential applications in the energy and environment sector.11–13 Different carbonaceous materials include graphite, carbon fibers, diamond, activated carbons, and others.14 In particular, activated carbons are of great interest by virtue of their intriguing features and tailored porosity for efficient CO2 adsorption.15,16 The widely used conventional source of activated carbon is coal, which is now less preferred owing to its non-renewable nature. As an alternative renewable carbon source, biomass is an excellent choice. The origin of biomass is the photosynthesis of CO2 and H2O in the presence of solar light. On a global scale, a billion tons of carbon-enriched natural biomass is produced annually along with a huge amount of biomass waste produced by agriculture, industry, and forest mining.17 Utilizing this enormous quantity of biomass for CO2 capture could not only mitigate global warming but also reduce the problems related to the accumulation of biomass.
When considering different biomass materials, lignocellulosic biomass is one of the most widely used agricultural wastes and acts as a carbon source to derive biomass-derived porous carbons (BPCs). Using lignocellulosic biomass instead of coal as a carbon precursor is a renewable and economically viable approach because of its reduced global warming effects and wide abundance.18,19 These biomass materials are transformed into biochar and activated carbons via pyrolysis and physical/chemical activations, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. Activated carbons derived from agriculture biomass generally possess a large specific surface area, high pore volume, and high thermo-chemical stability.20 Moreover, the textural and chemical features of activated carbons can be tuned by selecting appropriate biomass precursors, optimizing thermal conditions, using distinct chemical activating agents, and regulating the pyrolysis time.

Recently, the synthesis of activated carbons from distinct biomass materials as CO2 adsorbents has been reported in a large number of studies. Some of the commonly used biomass precursors are rice husk,21 coconut shell,22,23 orange peel,24 rubber-seed shell,25,26 shrimp shell,27 almond shell,28 hazelnut shell,29 walnut shell,30 pistachio-nut shell,31 palm kernel shell,32 and wood ash.33 Despite its huge applicability, it is still a challenging task to attain activated carbons with excellent textural features and favorable surface heterogeneity, simultaneously, from a complex 3D biomass structure, because of the high oxygen content and strong chemical bonding.34 However, biomass is a renewable and widely available carbon source and is making great contributions in driving present society towards renewable energy sources and a sustainable ecosystem.
In this review, we have comprehensively discussed BPC synthesis and its applications for CO2 adsorption. In brief, we have detailed biomass composition and precursor selection, different conversion strategies to finally achieve BPCs, the impact of functionalization to tune the surface chemistry of BPCs to achieve diverse textural features and CO2 adsorption performance, the mechanism behind CO2 capture, and the primary factors that influence CO2 uptake capacity. Moreover, this review discusses the current challenges that are faced during the synthesis of biomass, particularly in regulating the material's structure, finding suitable activating agents, sorbent recyclability, thermal and chemical stability, and finally utilization of as-prepared BPCs. Finally, we have specified technological challenges related to BPCs being used as CO2 adsorbents, and stated future research directions with prospective recommendations.
2. Biomass/biowaste: origin and composition
Biomass is an organic, renewable, and sustainable carbon-rich material generally composed of plants with complex natural polymers such as hemicellulose (15–30 wt%), lignin (16–33 wt%), cellulose (40–50 wt%), and other extractive materials (1–10 wt%) which function as structural organizing ingredients.35Fig. 2 demonstrates the typical chemical structure of biomass, i.e., lignocellulosic biomass.

This is used as feedstock for manufacturing different high-value products enriched with carbon materials, biofuels, and various industrial chemicals.36 Recently, biomass has been used as an inexpensive and green carbon source in the preparation of carbon-based nanomaterials, e.g., graphene, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, fullerene,37etc. Meanwhile, biowaste (BW), which is mostly composed of biomass, is another carbon-rich source that has recently attracted huge attention in the synthesis and fabrication of carbon-based nanomaterials. According to the European Commission, waste produced in gardens/parks, household food processing, kitchen waste, and food waste from restaurants is categorized as BW.38 However, in the academic literature, BW covers domestic and sewage waste, cattle manure, waste from the industrial processing of paper and food, agricultural and agro-industry waste, meat waste, and residue from forest and wood processing.39 Similar to biomass, the structural components of BW include cellulose, protein, starch, collagen, lipids, and chitin. They are inexpensive and abundant in nature, and can be used as raw materials to develop biotechnology-based energy sources without pressuring the increasingly limited food supply chain.40,41
2.1. Compositional analysis
Biomass is elementally composed of C, O, H, and some other elements (e.g., Si, Cl, Fe, P, etc.) with C covering the most part. However, many other biomasses reported in the literature vary in certain elemental compositions.43 However, the high amount of C, O, and H present in biomass is related to three prime structural polymers – cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose – which are generally present in all lignocellulosic precursors. Together with structural components, some non-structural elements like proteins, waxes, tannins (in wood), and chlorophylls are also responsible for the high content of C, O, and H.44
Moving further, the most Earth-abundant natural biopolymer is cellulose. A wide range of plants and a few bacteria contain cellulose as a primary structural element. Approximately 7.5 × 1010 tons is produced per year.45 Most natural fibers like linen or cotton contain cellulose as a principal component which constitutes over 90% of its total mass.46 Other lignocellulosic biomasses contain only 17–77%.44 Next, hemicellulose – another important component in natural fibers – is generally found in the secondary cell wall. For instance, bagasse (a leftover after crushing sugarcane or sorghum stalks) contains hemicellulose content up to 53.8%.47 Interestingly, hemicellulose can be hydrolyzed easily due to its disordered structure (with short interconnected horizontal chains) and low molecular weight compared with cellulose and lignin.48 Additionally, hemicelluloses are vulnerable to operational conditions such as temperature and retention time, so care must be taken when processing materials with hemicellulose as a major ingredient. The third most abundant polymer is lignin, which exists in plants and works as structural support. It is a phenolic compound with high molecular weight and generally resists microbial disintegration. Moreover, it also provides sealing to the water-conducting system between the plant's roots and leaves, and eventually limits plant degradation.49 Lignin is considered to be the most abundant renewable carbon source after cellulose, with 40–50 million tons per year of production worldwide.50 In addition, among all kinds of lignocellulosic materials, lignin has been found as the main constituent in lignocellulosic biomasses and is responsible for adsorption activities.51 Various lignocellulosic biomasses vary in lignin content, e.g., flax contains only 2.5% (ref. 52); however, coconut coir has a lignin presence of 59.5%.47 Further, lignocellulosic materials are considered a good choice for precursors in the production of activated carbons due to their carbon-rich content. The quantity of lignocellulosic content (i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) may vary in different precursors depending upon plant species, environmental conditions, quality, age of plants and season in which they were collected before they were transitioned into activated carbons.
2.2 Selection of the precursor
For the optimum selection of precursors for activated carbon (AC) synthesis, several characteristics must be considered. Among these, the abundant availability of precursor, economic viability, and its eco-friendly and non-hazardous nature, are of utmost importance. In this context, lignocellulosic biomass as AC precursor offers several advantages such as: (1) the precursors are abundant, renewable, and diverse, (2) the synthesis is facile owing to the larger reactivity of the biomass, (3) the overall process is less expensive as it also reduces cost expenditure linked with waste disposal, (4) the complete process significantly reduces negative impact to the environment. Furthermore, for better structural and textural characteristics in biomass-derived activated carbons, two basic features are the presence of high carbon content and a low quantity of ash.53
Considering the aforementioned characteristics, several useful precursors have been obtained from wood biomass, plant biomass, agricultural waste, industrial biowaste, and mixtures. In plant-derived biomass, different parts such as stems, cores, shells, flowers, peels, stones, seeds, leaves, fruits, and husks are used for AC fabrication. Recently, aquatic biomass, for instance, starch, grass, cakes, and fibers as well as some other non-traditional precursors have been more typically identified as AC precursors.
3. Biomass conversion strategies
Various thermo-chemical processes can be used for attaining biomaterials-derived carbons and their applications for CO2 adsorption and storage. In general, there are four major routes for the synthesis of valuable carbon-based materials: pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), physical activation, and chemical activation, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Pyrolysis is typically employed as an energy recovery process and is capable of generating various products such as oil, gas, and, importantly, char or biochar.54 During pyrolysis/HTC, moisture and volatile mass content are removed from the biomass, leaving behind solid biochar which exhibits properties distinct from the precursor materials. These resultant biochar by-products can be used to produce many carbon-based materials such as activated carbon, nanoporous carbons, nanostructured carbon (e.g., fullerene), carbon nanotubes, and graphene.37,55,56 The surface morphology and functional groups of these carbon-based materials can be activated further by using suitable methods and activating agents.57 During physical activation, various gas-activating agents such as steam and CO2 are used, whereas for chemical activation chemical agents such as metal oxide, alkaline metal, and acids are employed to design porous carbons. A detailed discussion of these conversion strategies is presented below.

3.1. Pyrolysis
The process of thermal decomposition of organic materials at a particular temperature and under inert environmental conditions is termed “pyrolysis”. It is regarded as a fuel-processing technology that converts carbonaceous materials into three useful pyrogenic byproducts, pyrolytic oil, syngas, and biochar, in an oxygen-free environment.58 The amount of conversion of carbonaceous materials into these pyrogenic byproducts highly depends upon the choice of carbonaceous materials, treatment time, processing temperature, heating rates, etc. Typically, three main biopolymers, cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose, are the main ingredients in naturally occurring plant-based biomass. During the pyrolysis process, owing to their different chemical structures, these components demonstrate their own set of complex reactions. Based on the pyrolysis conditions, the thermal decay profile for these components is shown in Fig. 4. The pyrolysis process can be categorized into conventional/slow pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis, and flash pyrolysis (heating rate >1000 °C s−1; heating temperature 900–1300 °C) based on pyrolysis conditions.59 Moving further, the slow pyrolysis converts biomass into solid biochar and is generally performed at heating temperature 300–800 °C, heating rate 5–7 °C min−1, and processing time >1 h. The yield of biochar after slow pyrolysis is approximately 35–50 wt% compared with the original weight of biomass, and it decreases with a further rise in heating temperature.60 Typically, a higher biochar yield was observed in lignin-rich biomass, attributable to the high thermal stability of lignin compared with cellulose and hemicellulose.61

Recently, Keiluweit et al.62 reported four distinct stages that occur during the transition of biomass into biochar after studying their crystallinity, surface functional groups, and structural analysis. Two different kinds of biochars were achieved after the pyrolysis of wood and grass. The authors observed no change in biomass at the initial temperature (100 °C); however, as the pyrolysis temperature increases, dehydration and depolymerization begin but overall biomass crystalline matrix remains unaltered. Meanwhile, volatile matter such as H2O, CO, CO2, and others is released randomly, resulting in a significant decrease in biochar yield. With the further rise in temperature, a disordered structure with aromatic/aliphatic chains was formed due to a substantial loss of volatile matter. The amorphous phases of as-obtained biochar contain graphitic carbons. These graphitic crystalline carbons transform to long-range order after the production of nanopores (≤2 nm) at elevated temperatures. Both wood (high content of lignin) and grass (low lignin content)-derived biochar possess similar structures but differ in quantity, demonstrating the fact that at similar pyrolysis conditions, the biochar morphology strictly depends upon biomass precursors. Thus, one can summarize that pyrolysis temperature plays a significant role in manipulating the characteristics of porous carbons. The carbonaceous material prepared at higher pyrolysis temperature possesses higher quality at the expense of a lower yield due to (1) biomass decomposition primarily, and (2) decomposition of biochar residue secondarily. On the other hand, heating rate, processing time, and inert gas affect pore structure, pore morphology, and resultant carbon yield. Moreover, as a result of pyrolysis, initially a low porosity is formed in as-prepared biochar. These pores get filled with tarry pyrolysis leftover, and thus require an activation process to develop particular characteristics of carbon. The BET-N2 adsorption based surface area (SA), resultant yield, quantitative compositional analyses, and elemental analyses (C, N, H, O) of wood and grass char samples produced at different charring temperatures (100–700 °C) are shown numerically in Table 1. Above 400 °C, yields begin to stabilize after initially declining rapidly at 200 °C for wood and 300 °C for grass. Grass char has a higher yield in the end (∼29%) compared with char made from wood (∼22%).

3.2. Hydrothermal carbonization
Peat and coal are naturally created from biological materials over extremely long timespans. This process can take from thousands to millions of years. The natural coaling process has motivated scientists and researchers to develop a laboratory-based synthetic method to produce carbonaceous material from natural biomass on a shorter timescale. For this purpose, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), a process in which an aqueous solution is used to treat carbon precursors at elevated temperatures (<300 °C) and pressures, has been investigated. This method was originally reported by Bergius in 1913 and further developed by Berl and Schmidt in 1932 as a promising approach for the transformation of cellulose into a coal-like material.63 More recently, the HTC method has gained attention as a potential technique to synthesize various carbon architectures with controlled shapes and structural morphologies such as carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, and carbon spheres, using water-soluble carbohydrates (e.g., cellulose, glucose, starch, fructose, and sucrose) as initial precursors.37
With interesting features, the HTC method is preferred over conventional pyrolysis processes due to its low cost, moderate synthesis conditions, and eco-friendliness. Moreover, HTC using non-hazardous solvents generates high carbon yields and functional groups-enriched carbon surfaces, which make it a promising approach for transforming biomass into high-performing carbon materials. Hydrothermally treated biomass (biochar) is generally considered a more effective carbon precursor than pristine biomass for synthesizing activated carbons with high specific surface area and well-defined porosity owing to its homogeneous composition and porous nature. In order to understand the fundamentals of the HTC process, carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, xylose, furfural, and starch) were used to produce carbonaceous materials.67 The structural morphologies of these prepared hydrothermal carbons were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and are shown in Fig. 5(a–d).65–67 During hydrothermal treatment, glucose, starch, sucrose, cellulose, and other carbohydrates undergo a series of dehydration reactions to generate hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and furfuryl derivatives which upon polymerization, condensation and aromatization give rise to functionalized carbon spheres (Fig. 5(a–d)). In addition, spherical carbons contain several polar functional groups, allowing for further functionalization and increasing their hydrophilicity. Plants with soft materials (e.g., orange peel) lose their structural morphology during the HTC process, resulting in the production of spherical nanoparticles.68 In contrast, the crystalline structure of hard plants (e.g., oak leaves) is maintained after HTC treatment (Fig. 5(e)).65 Carbonaceous materials obtained via HTC attain hydrophilicity due to the presence of polar functional groups, as indicated by FTIR (Fig. 5(f)). In addition, the HTC method has been used to fabricate fluorescent carbon nanodots from plant waste. Shen et al. reported the synthesis of fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) using sweet potato as a carbon source and water as a reagent66Fig. 5(g–j). The CDs were spherical and uniformly dispersed, with an average size of 3.39 nm.

Despite moderate synthetic conditions and high carbon yields, the HTC products are less porous and exhibit lower specific surface area (SSA) than activated carbons, making them less favorable for gas adsorption applications. However, the use of templates (e.g., SPA-15) or activation (e.g., KOH) followed by the hydrothermal carbonization process may improve porosity and enhance SSA in carbonaceous materials.69,70 In a report, Sevilla and coworkers demonstrated the successful transformation of biomass to highly porous carbons (specific surface area ∼2850 m2 g−1) via hydrothermal carbonization followed by chemical activation.71 The synergistic effect of HTC and chemical activation led to functional group generation on carbon surfaces and a high population of pores in a sub-nanometer range, which subsequently led to excellent CO2 uptake of 4.8 mmol g−1 at 298 K and 1 bar. Moreover, maximum CO2 uptake (∼95%) was observed in the initial 2 min, revealing the fast kinetics of adsorption. To tune the surface morphology and chemistry of hydrothermally carbonized biomass, different templates and additives are being extensively used. In a report, carbon microspheres decorated with carboxylate groups were prepared by HTC of glucose in the presence of the acrylic acid additive.72 Similarly, Liu et al.73 chemically activated HTC-derived carboxyl-rich carbons and attained an ultramicroporous (<0.7 nm) structure which subsequently exhibited efficient CO2 adsorption of 5.87 mmol g−1 at 273 K and 1 bar. Table 2 summarizes the production of biomass using different synthetic methods i.e., pyrolysis/carbonization, or HTC.

3.3. Activation
From the above discussions, it can already be inferred that pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization leads to less developed porous carbon structures. To circumvent this issue, carbonaceous materials with excellent textural features are being prepared using different activation methods including physical activation by steam, CO2, O2, etc., and chemical activation by alkali and alkaline earth metal salts, metal oxides, and inorganic acids. These carbon materials, termed ‘activated carbons’, generally possess high specific surface area, excellent porosity with wider pore size distributions, and heterogeneous chemical surfaces. The activated carbons exhibit a wide range of physicochemical characteristics, textural and morphological features, micro-nanostructure, surface chemistry, and numerous potential applications, depending on the type of carbon precursors used. Recently, lignocellulosic biomass resources have been widely used as carbon precursors owing to their renewable nature and large abundance, as previously discussed. The microporous internal structure and high specific surface area (SSA) of activated BPCs are ideal for industrial-scale applications in CO2 adsorption.83,84Table 3 illustrates the synthetic conditions as well as the CO2 capture performance of biomass-derived activated porous carbons.

3.3.1. Physical activation. 
Physical activation is a two-step process. First, pyrolysis of raw material is carried out at temperatures <1000 K. Then, controlled gasification is performed under an inert atmosphere at temperatures >1150 K in oxidizing gases such as CO2, steam, air, or a mixture of the three.126,127 The first step results in the carbonization of raw material into biochar and is key for pore structure development, whereas the second step further opens pores and enhances overall SSA.51 Additionally, physical activation can affect the surface chemistry of the biochar, altering its hydrophobicity, surface functional groups, and polarity.128 The resultant carbon yield is highly dependent upon thermal parameters such as heating temperature and activation time. With the temperature rise, a large amount of volatile matter is purged from the carbon framework. In addition, a longer activation time increases the deterioration of carbon and other organic elements by offering more oxidizing gases (CO2, O2, or steam). All this significantly reduces the final carbon yield but can enhance surface area and pore volume. The primary physical activation processes, briefly explained below, are (a) steam activation and (b) gas activation.
(a) Steam activation. 
After the thermal carbonization of biomass, steam activation is used to activate the biochar. The chemical reactions which occur during steam activation are described by eqn (1) and (2), below:18 C(s) + H2O(g) → CO(g) + H2(g) ΔH = 117 kJ mol−1(1) CO(g) + H2O(g) ⇌ CO2(g) + H2(g) ΔH = 41 kJ mol−1(2)
Three important changes occur during this process: (i) the removal of volatile materials and the disintegration of tar; (ii) the generation of new micropores; and (iii) the broadening of existing pores.129 Steam activation of biochar substantially enhances the specific surface area (SSA), microporous structure, and micropore volume. Rajapaksha et al.130 reported that steam-activated biochar prepared from tea waste at 700 °C exhibits higher SSA (∼576.1 m2 g−1), pore diameter (1.998 nm), and pore volume (0.109 cm3 g−1) compared with non-activated biochar produced under similar conditions (SSA of 342.2 m2 g−1, pore diameter of 1.756 nm, and pore volume of 0.022 cm3 g−1). Similarly, Shim et al.131 reported an enhanced SSA (322 m2 g−1) in the steam-activated giant Miscanthus compared with its non-activated form (SSA of 181 m2 g−1), possibly due to large micropore development from steam activation. The SSA and porosity of activated biochar are highly dependent on activation temperature, steam flow rate, and total activation time.
SSA and pore structure can also be improved by increasing activation time. Initially, increasing activation time facilitates the creation of new pores which increases the SSA. However, with a further increase in activation time, the existing pores widen with little formation of new pores, leading to a significant decrease in the SSA and pore volume.132 Furthermore, steam flow rates and feedstock types might influence activation efficacy because different biomass ingredients react to activation parameters differently. Steam activation also alters the surface chemistry of biochar by changing the amount of surface functional groups. Shen et al. reported that physical activation by steam and microwave assistance improves the porous structure and increases the oxygenated functional groups in activated biochar.133,134 Additionally, steam activation may reduce the hydrophobicity and improve polarity on the biochar surface.130
(b) Gas activation. 
Similarly, gas activation can be used to increase SSA and pore volume by reacting with the biochar surface.135 CO2, NH3, N2, O2, air, or mixtures of these gases are typically used in the gas activation process. Among these, CO2 is the most commonly used. CO2 directly reacts with the biochar surface according to the following Boudouard reaction (eqn (3)):136 C(s) + CO2(g) → 2CO(g)(3)
The Boudouard reaction is theoretically and thermodynamically favorable at temperatures greater than 710 °C (i.e., ΔG ≤ 0).137 Fang et al.138 recently demonstrated the effect of CO2 activation temperature (600–900 °C) and treatment time (1–2 h) on the physicochemical properties of peanut and hickory hulls. They found that SSA and pore volume increased with increasing treatment temperature and activation time. Furthermore, Li et al.139 reported the CO2 activation process using starch as a precursor to prepare carbon spheres with ultrahigh surface area (3350 m2 g−1). The resultant product was claimed to achieve high CO2 uptake of 21.2 mmol g−1 at 25 °C and 20 bar. Moving further, Plaza et al.140 employed the O2 activation process on olive stones and almond shells to produce highly porous activated carbons. Initially, an extreme burn-off and a low carbon yield were observed during the activation process because of exothermic enthalpy which restrains control over reaction temperature and O2 reaction speed with carbon. However, a controlled grip of activation conditions (e.g., O2 content) could significantly tune the pore size distribution of carbon materials, thus delivering high CO2 uptake of 1.36 and 3.1 mmol g−1 at 0.1 and 1 bar, and 0 °C.
Additionally, a mixture of gases during the activation process can also increase SSA. For instance, Jung et al.85 prepared oak biochar under different mixtures of activating gas and obtained a high SSA (1126 m2 g−1) under N2/CO2 gas activation compared with the SSA value achieved by direct CO2 gas activation (800 m2 g−1). In another report, the activation of cotton stalk in the presence of CO2/NH3 at 500–900 °C increased the surface area (627.15 m2 g−1) and generated nitrogen-based functional groups in the resulting biochar.141 This activation is described by the following chemical reactions (eqn (4) and (5)). Xu et al.142 also reported a similar synthesis mechanism of N-doped biochar where biochar containing surface functional groups –COOH or –OH reacted with NH3 to generate nitrile (eqn (4)) and amine (eqn (5)) under 450 °C and 600 °C. (4) (5)


3.3.2. Chemical activation. 
Pyrolysis using chemical activation is a one-step procedure performed in temperatures ranging from ∼700 K to ∼1200 K in the presence of activating agents such as H3PO4, K2CO3, ZnCl2, and KOH.143–146 Recent developments in the preparation of activated carbons (ACs) from natural biomasses or biowastes as well as engineering advancements for improving the porosity and surface characteristics of ACs have ignited future research interest in this field. ACs produced by chemical activation exhibit very high SSA (generally >2000 m2 g−1) and pore volume (Fig. 6).147 Moreover, chemical activation has several advantages over physical activation including lower conversion temperatures, decreased activation time, high carbon yield, high SSA, and high porosity.

Serafin et al.148 have demonstrated the synthesis of porous carbons using different biomass precursors such as sugar beet pulp, kiwi and carrot peels, and fern leaves by KOH chemical activation. The prepared carbons have shown large microporosity with remarkable surface area reaching 1593 m2 g−1 as well as obvious narrow micropores that have contributed excellent CO2 adsorption of 1.25 mmol g−1 (0.15 bar) and 4.18 mmol g−1 (1 bar) at 25 °C. Even though the study demonstrated excellent CO2 capture performance, the use of a large amount of alkali “KOH” activation (typically KOH: precursor weight ratio is 3/4:1) through inhomogeneous physical mixing could easily damage the structural morphology and collapse the carbon framework, thus limiting large-scale and sustainable production using this method.
To avoid the requirement for a large amount of KOH and its associated corrosive properties, researchers have developed a new approach called “in situ ionic activation methodology” in which homodisperse K ions are used as an activating agent to achieve an ultramicroporous carbon framework.151 This strategy not only circumvents alkali activation-derived corrosive properties but also supports a facile route to achieve a precise ultramicroporous framework of carbon materials, which is very important for achieving excellent CO2 adsorption performance. As a result of 95.5% ultramicropore content in prepared carbons, superior CO2 uptake values of 1.58 mmol g−1 (0.15 bar) and 4.3 mmol g−1 (1 bar) at 25 °C were achieved.
Several reagents other than potassium-based compounds have been utilized as chemical activating agents. For instance, Vargas et al.153 studied the CO2 adsorption performance of porous carbons prepared from palm stone's chemical activation using H3PO4 and ZnCl2. The prepared carbons demonstrated an excellent CO2 capture of 3.8 mmol g−1 (using ZnCl2) and 4.2 mmol g−1 (using H3PO4) when measured at 1 bar per 0 °C. This remarkable adsorption performance is ascribed to their small sizes and dehydrative function that have simultaneously contributed toward the development of a microporous carbon framework.
Among various potential activating agents such as NaOH, KCl, and ZnCl2, KOH is widely used due to its lower activation temperature, higher resultant yield, and contribution toward the development of ultimate narrow micropores or small mesopores in the carbon framework. KOH-activated carbonaceous materials exhibit high SSA and well-developed pore size distribution (Fig. 7).110 In this figure, using KOH and ZnCl2 as activating agents leads to porous carbon with high specific area and, consequently, excellent gas adsorption performance. The thermal degradation of ACs is shown in Fig. 7(b). ACs possess excellent textural features and high thermal stability up to 624.44 K. The underlying KOH activation mechanism is still not fully understood due to the inclusion of different experimental parameters and precursors. Here, we explain the mechanism in detail. KOH reacts with the precursor via a solid-phase reaction mechanism followed by a sequence of solid–liquid reactions. Meanwhile, potassium oxide is disintegrated into metallic potassium. The KOH activation of petroleum coke occurs at temperatures below 1000 K and is described by the following eqns (6)–(14):154 2KOH → K2O + H2O(6) C + H2O → CO + H2(7) CO + H2O → CO2 + H2(8) CO2 + K2O → K2CO3(9) 6KOH + 2C → 2K + 3H2 + 2K2CO3(10)

(c) As-prepared ACs surface areas and corresponding CO2 capture capacities at 273 K. Reproduced from ref. 152 with permission from [Elsevier], copyright [2019]. 
Initially, KOH is converted to K2O via a dehydration reaction (T < 700 K) while carbonaceous material is converted to CO2 and H2via the reaction of C with H2O. K2CO3 is produced by the reaction of K2O and CO2. As the temperature increases to 900 K, KOH is completely consumed leading to the formation of metallic potassium (eqn (10)). K2CO3 → K2O + CO2(11) CO2 + C → 2CO(12) K2CO3 + 2C → 2K + 3CO(13) C + K2O → 2K + CO(14)
Furthermore, when the temperature rises above 1000 K, potassium carbonate is reduced to K2O and CO2 and is completely consumed when the temperature reaches ∼1100 K. Meanwhile, CO2 is reduced to CO, and K2CO3 and K2O are converted to metallic potassium. The KOH-activation process can be summarized in three stages: (1) the chemical activation process leads to the formation of the carbon framework and porous network construction, (2) at high temperatures, water and CO2 are mixed to form steam, and (3), metallic potassium molecules diffuse into the carbon matrix and expand the carbon lattice.155 Raw materials such as conventional coal, cokes, lignite, peat and renewable biowaste precursors like agricultural and forestry wastes (e.g., rice husks, rice straw, wood, barks, nut shells, etc.) have been used in many chemical activation studies for the industrial-scale production of ACs.156 Eventually, these activated carbonaceous materials are used in gas and energy storage applications.157
Chemical activation typically uses a lower activation temperature in comparison with physical activation; however, it supports facile porosity adjustment and delivers higher resultant carbon yield. Generally speaking, for both chemical and physical activation processes, a higher activation temperature leads to increased porosity due to the material volatilization process; however, overall carbon yield is significantly reduced. Therefore, it is necessary to choose an appropriate activation condition so that a balance between pore texture and resultant carbon yield can be achieved to eventually acquire excellent CO2 capture performance. Moreover, during chemical activation, KOH is widely used to derive porous carbons from biomass/biowaste. However, it offers serious environmental and economic challenges owing to its highly corrosive nature and requirement of high temperature for activation, thereby posing a huge energy penalty. To circumvent environmental challenges, researchers are employing activating agents like potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and potassium oxalate (K2C2O4) salts to produce biomass/biowaste porous carbons. These salts are less corrosive as compared with KOH and are environmentally benign. To address the energy penalty challenge, a recent approach has been to prepare carbons using concentrated solar energy following a process called “solar pyrolysis”. This strategy offers several advantages in comparison with conventional pyrolysis: (1) focused solar radiation is a rapid strategy concerning turning on/off the process; (2) using solar energy one can achieve the required heat without burning a fraction of biomass, thus it boosts the overall yield of the process; (3) it also curbs contamination of combustion gases with pyrolysis products. Lobato-Peralta et al.158 reported porous carbon synthesis from Agave angustifolia leaves, an agro-industrial waste, by K2CO3 activation, and proclaimed it as an environmentally friendly activating agent. The authors used a solar pyrolysis approach where the reaction mixture was pyrolyzed in a solar furnace at high temperatures (up to 950 °C), using concentrated solar energy as a heat source. This study offers an economically beneficial route based on renewable and inexhaustible energy sources. Based on the literature survey, despite environmental and economic concerns, KOH is still being widely used owing to its intensive chemical etching and highly porous carbon formation properties. To reduce KOH usage, more efforts should be carried out in developing less corrosive activating agents, that require relatively low activation temperatures, as well as utilizing novel renewable energy sources to combat overall environmental and economic challenges.


3.3.3. Sol–gel process. 
Porous carbons that have diverse morphologies (e.g., cylindrical, spherical, and even cuboid) can be prepared using a sol–gel process. Pekala et al.159,160 demonstrated a study as early as 1989, in which the authors discussed that resorcinol can be reacted to formaldehyde when exposed to alkaline conditions to achieve an opaque gel which was solidified at 95 °C over 3–7 days to finally obtain the solid gel. After conducting carbonization of these gels, carbon aerogels were achieved with unique nanostructures. Since the development of this method, it has become one of the most promising techniques to prepare porous carbons owing to its controllability of the texture, homogeneity, composition and structure of the porous carbons. Recently, this method has widely been used to prepare renewable BPCs, particularly from polysaccharides (e.g., cellulose and starch). Polysaccharides naturally possess self-ordering characteristics, and therefore can easily adopt any specific structure or physical form. “Starbons®” carbon, which was developed from polysaccharides, demonstrated a highly developed mesoporous structure. Specifically, this methodology offers a facile route to tune the pore volume and carbon size.161 Generally, the sol–gel process comprises three main stages: (1) Precursor gelatinization is carried out in water under heating; (2) a solvent (e.g., ethanol) is introduced which replaces moisture within the gel; and (3) upon drying, the prepared gel is doped with some acid (considering the catalytic amount) followed by pyrolysis in the vacuum, thus finally resulting in the creation of highly porous carbons.
Liu et al.162 synthesized a translucent sol via molecular interactions using corn starch (a carbon precursor) mixed with an optimum volume of KOH solution. Upon drying, followed by carbonization and washing, a three dimensional (3D) porous carbon framework was achieved which showed a remarkable surface area (1535 m2 g−1) and large porosity as well as promising pore size distribution. Mokaya et al.163 reported the preparation of porous carbons using a facile subcritical drying route together with the activation process. The conducted process does not require additional drying steps, modifications, or even sol–gel additives. As-prepared microporous carbons demonstrated a high surface area (1980 m2 g−1) and pore volume (2.03 cm3 g−1), with most pore sizes of ca. 0.8 and 1.3 nm. Finally, the porous carbons exhibited a CO2 capture performance of 2.7–3.0 mmol g−1 when measured at room temperature and ambient pressure. The sol–gel approach has been widely used at both laboratory and industrial scale, owing to its production of relatively high carbon yield which is possible from successful gelatinization and negligible mass loss during the fabrication process. The main drawback is the severe drying process for wet gel as well as the time-consuming preparation period. In addition, during the solvent exchange process, a small change can trigger substantial modifications in the textural features and overall properties of the prepared carbons. Moreover, pore blocking that occurs during the gelatinization process also requires serious attention.

4. Applications
The industrial revolution and rising living standards in the developing world have created serious environmental and economic concerns. Drastic increases in CO2 emissions have rapidly accelerated global warming and climate change.164 According to one report, CO2 emissions have increased by 80% from 1970 to 2004.165 The current concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is >400 ppm, which is much greater than the permitted limit of 350 ppm imposed to maintain a sustainable and habitable planet.166
Researchers worldwide are continuously developing strategies to circumvent CO2 emissions in order to preserve our planet. To adsorb large quantities of CO2, highly textured materials with high surface areas are required. Many carbon-based materials are available as adsorbent materials for CO2 capture; however, biowaste-derived carbonaceous materials are preferred due to their improved textural features, comparatively simple synthetic methods, high CO2 capture ability, and cheap and renewable nature. Fig. 8 shows the required characteristics, production of biochar and BPCs, and their potential applications in sectors such as CO2 adsorption, supercapacitors, catalysis, batteries, and water remediation.167

4.1. CO2 capture
Various adsorbents have been proposed for efficient CO2 capture. An ideal adsorbent must have high selectivity for CO2, microporous structures, low heat of adsorption, fast adsorption kinetics, a sustainable carbonaceous framework, and be cost-efficient.168 Most of the work in the domain of pre- and post-combustion CO2 capture has focused on adsorption by various functionalized porous materials, membrane separation, and adsorption in blended amine solutions.169 Many researchers have also recently explored biowaste-derived ACs. The most common method (pyrolysis) converts biowaste residue into highly porous ACs, which are later used for CO2 capture on an industrial scale.170 These biomass-based porous carbon materials can drastically reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by limiting CO2 emissions from rotten biomass. Additionally, adding biochar to soil could reduce CO2 emissions by 33%.171 Finally, ACs can efficiently remove CO2 from flue gas streams that originate from fossil fuel combustion.
Below, various biochar and ACs produced from different biowaste precursors for CO2 capture are discussed. It has been demonstrated that biochar is a highly non-porous material and is ineffective for CO2 capture; thus, techniques to activate its porosity and surface properties to enhance CO2 uptake are required. Methods of AC production under different experimental conditions and utilizing unique activating agents have been employed in the literature for highly efficient CO2 capture.

4.1.1. Non-functionalized biomass-derived CO2 adsorbents. 
Manufacturing costs and environmental concerns have motivated researchers to develop biowaste-based materials to produce ACs that can act as efficient CO2 adsorbents. Wang et al.121 recently used celtuce leaf residue (Fig. 9(a)) to produce highly porous carbon materials by using a facile two-step method involving pyrolysis in the presence of argon at 600 °C followed by KOH activation. The ACs have a high surface area (∼3404 m2 g−1) and a large pore volume (∼1.88 cm3 g−1). Moreover, the highly porous ACs exhibit excellent CO2 uptake—6.04 mmol g−1 and 4.36 mmol g−1 at ambient pressure and 0 °C and 25 °C, respectively. With a simple manufacturing process and abundant feedstock, celtuce leaf waste-based ACs are promising materials for CO2 capture.121

Moving further, Kim et al.172 used waste coffee grounds (Fig. 9(b)) as a precursor to producing carbon materials upon K2CO3 activation. They studied the textural morphologies and CO2 adsorption capacities of ACs by varying the activation temperature and treatment time. With increasing activation temperature (800 °C) and time (5 hours), the SSA and total pore volume were maximized to values of 2337 m2 g−1 and 1.15 cm3 g−1, respectively. However, the highest CO2 adsorption (4.54 mmol g−1) was achieved by ACs produced at 700 °C for 5 hours. Interestingly, narrow pore volume played a dominant role in CO2 adsorption at 1 bar due to strong adsorption potentials which enhance the interactions between CO2 molecules and microporous walls. These coffee ground waste ACs exhibit exceptional cyclic retention and decent selectivity for CO2, and are very profitable when used for industrial CO2 capture.172
Li et al.173 recently proposed the use of a three-dimensional microporous carbon architecture by using mangosteen peel (MP) for efficient CO2 capture (Fig. 9(c)). The MP was placed in an alkaline solution-filled autoclave for hydrothermal treatment. After several hours of hydrothermal treatment, the MPs were dried and subsequently carbonized at 700 °C for 2 hours. The resultant carbonaceous samples had a large SSA (up to 1270 m2 g−1) and abundant micropores with sizes less than 1 nm. Excellent CO2 uptake (6.93 and 4.77 mmol g−1 at 0 °C and 25 °C, respectively) was observed. The simple preparation route and abundant biowaste source are promising for the use of three-dimensional porous carbon materials for CO2 capture.173 Yue et al.120 reported the production of porous carbon material for excellent CO2 capture using rotten strawberries (RS) (Fig. 9(d)). These RS were used as carbon precursors. Hydrothermal treatment was carried out on the RS to produce biomass-derived carbon materials which were later converted to ACs after KOH activation. The resultant ACs demonstrated superb CO2 adsorption of approximately 6.35 mmol g−1 and 4.49 mmol g−1 at 0 °C and 25 °C, respectively. Additionally, RS-based ACs exhibit reusability, mild heat of CO2 adsorption, fast CO2 capture kinetics, and high CO2 selectivity. These qualities, along with the cost-effectiveness and abundance of RS precursors, make this adsorbent an outstanding candidate for efficient CO2 capture.120
Wei et al.108 highlighted the contributions of ultra-micropores in CO2 adsorption by KOH-activated, bamboo-derived carbonaceous materials. A narrow pore size distribution (<0.8 nm) with well-defined pores around 0.55 nm in diameter resulted in high CO2 adsorption (7 mmol g−1 at 0 °C and 1 bar). Additionally, they elucidated the role played by chemical activation by varying the concentration of KOH. At high KOH concentrations, wider pores and higher SSA were attained, resulting in drastically reduced CO2 adsorption capacity, which further confirms the importance of narrow micropores in efficient gas adsorption. In another study, Sevilla et al.71 reported on the CO2 adsorption capacity of KOH-activated sawdust. By varying the KOH/precursor ratio from 2 to 4, they demonstrated that at low KOH concentrations, well-defined, narrow micropores were generated in the carbon framework which led to high CO2 adsorption (4.8 mmol g−1 at 25 °C and 1 bar). Thus, micropores smaller than 1 nm are crucial for efficient CO2 uptake. Table 3 illustrates some of the recently reported biowaste-derived activated carbons with their synthetic conditions, textural features, and CO2 adsorption capacities at 1 bar.


4.1.2. Functionalized biomass-derived CO2 adsorbents. 
(a) Role of nitrogen-containing functional groups. 
To improve the CO2 capture performance of activated BPCs, one of the most promising and effective approaches is to introduce heteroatoms inside porous carbons. The incorporation of heteroatoms improves the electronegativity of porous carbons, finally resulting in an improved CO2 performance as compared with non-doped carbons.174 Among heteroatoms, ones which have a basic or electron-rich character e.g., nitrogen, can significantly enhance CO2 adsorption capacity when introduced into a porous carbon framework, owing to the provision of basic sites which serve as anchoring sites to capture weakly acidic CO2 molecules.167 Various N-functional groups can be formed over adsorbent surfaces, such as pyridinic, pyrrolic, graphitic, and quaternary. All these N-functionalities, except that of quaternary, form at the edge site of the graphitic plane. These N-functional groups offer basic sites (typically having lone electron pairs in sp3 orbital) to strongly hold CO2 molecules; however, the oxygen atom of the CO2 molecule possesses a strong electron-removing characteristic and thus makes the C-atom electrophilic, therefore when these carbon atoms get close to some electron-rich nitrogen species, they bind strongly with them.175 Singh et al.167 discussed that Pyridinic-N donates one electron toward the aromatic π-system resulting in the generation of Lewis basic interactions. This causes significant charge transfer to CO2 and eventually reduces the CO2 bond angle. Additionally, such Lewis acid–base interactions designate the contribution of the electron lone pair of the N-atom to the carbon atom of CO2. Moving on, Sun et al.176 have demonstrated both computational and experimental results to prove the role played by nitrogen species in improving CO2 adsorption over carbon surfaces. The authors have reported larger binding energies between CO2 molecules and pyrrolic-, pyridinic-N moieties as compared with CO2 molecules and quaternary-N moiety. Additionally, the authors indicated a dispersion interaction for a quaternary-N, and electrostatic interaction for pyrrolic-, and pyridinic-N. Ma et al.177 studied heteroatom-doped nanoporous carbons and demonstrated excellent CO2 adsorption as a result of increased Lewis acid–base interactions with binding energy (21.26 kJ mol−1) among pyridinic-N moieties and CO2 molecules. Based on the aforementioned reports, the pyridinic and pyrrolic-N content are the most influential nitrogen species which play a primary role in achieving remarkable CO2 adsorption.
More recently, Rehman et al.24 demonstrated a detailed study based on the valorization of orange peel waste to produce heteroatom-doped porous carbons to observe CO2 adsorption/separation performance, as illustrated in Fig. 10. The detailed step-by-step synthetic protocol can be visualized in Fig. 10(a). To produce heteroatom doping, melamine was added at the stirring step which induced nitrogen functionalities in final porous carbons. The SEM image, Fig. 10(b), illustrates the hierarchical morphology of prepared orange-peel-derived porous carbon. The CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms are presented in Fig. 10(c), which showed a higher adsorption trend for CO2 (6.67 mmol g−1 at 273 K per 1 bar), revealing the positive potential of the prepared carbons for CO2 gas storage. Finally, to prove potential applications, the authors elucidated the IAST method-based CO2/N2 selectivity (105), as shown in Fig. 10(d).

Recently, Han et al.178 used sugarcane bagasse as a carbon precursor for CO2 capture (Fig. 11(a)). In this study, nitrogen was doped via the addition of urea during KOH activation. The effects of KOH concentration, carbon content, and temperature on the textural properties and CO2 uptake were investigated. The adsorbent was activated at 600 °C with a urea content of 15 wt% and a KOH:carbon mass ratio of 2. The highest CO2 uptake observed at 25 °C and 1 bar was 4.8 mmol g−1. The presence of pyridinic, pyrrolic, quaternary, and pyridine-oxide nitrogen moieties on the carbon surface and the abundance of uniform micropores (0.55 nm) result in excellent CO2 capture, CO2/N2 selective adsorption behavior, and facile regeneration. Thus, high micropore volume and sufficient nitrogen content help to promote high CO2 uptake.

In another report, Wei et al.179 demonstrated N-enriched porous carbon synthesis using water chestnut, melamine, and KOH as the carbon source, nitrogen dopant, and activating agent, respectively (Fig. 11(b)). The activation was carried out for 2 hours at 600–900 °C. The resulting samples exhibit well-developed narrow micropores, large SSA (∼3401 m2 g−1), and high nitrogen concentration (4.89 wt%). High CO2 uptake (up to 6.0 mmol g−1 at 0 °C and 4.7 mmol g−1 at 25 °C) and CO2/N2 selectivity were attributed to the well-defined porous network and high N-content.
Recently, Zhang et al.105 synthesized activated porous carbons from black locust (biomass) used as a carbon precursor and KOH as a chemical activating agent. Additionally, a solution of NH3 was introduced during the carbonization process to embed nitrogen-functional groups over the AC surfaces. The prepared carbons possess a higher nitrogen content (7.21%) and demonstrated a remarkable surface area (2511 m2 g−1) which was significantly higher than only KOH-activated carbon without NH3 treatment (2064 m2 g−1). This is attributed to severe chemical reactions that occur due to KOH chemical etching and NH3 heat treatment. Nitrogen-enriched ACs demonstrated excellent CO2 adsorption of 7.19 mmol g−1 at 0 °C and 5.5 mmol g-1 at 25 °C. The authors claimed that the presence of abundant ultra-micropores was responsible for achieving excellent CO2 adsorption, fast kinetics, large CO2/N2 selectivity (30.75%), and high regeneration. In another study, Zhao et al.181 demonstrated a high CO2/N2 selectivity (up to 42) which was attributed to high nitrogen content in the prepared carbons. Zhang et al.182 reported nitrogen-doped carbons and determined that the CO2 capture and CO2/N2 selectivity performance was jointly governed by the volume of narrow micropores and nitrogen-functional groups. Conversely, Mokaya et al.183 have shown that CO2 capture and CO2/N2 selectivity performance is determined by narrow micropores (0.5–1 nm), whereas incorporation of N2 species into the carbon framework does not improve these factors. Nguyen et al.184 developed nitrogen-doped carbonaceous beads. At first, pristine biochar was prepared from chicken manure, which was later treated with HNO3, NH3, and glucopyranuronate to finally achieve a bead-like morphology in the final composite with a nitrogen content of 6.32%. The prepared carbonaceous beads were tested for CO2 capture. The highest CO2 adsorption was found to be 10.15 mmol g−1 at 20 °C, which indicates the adsorption process was of an exothermic nature. Additionally, CO2/N2 selectivity (79.1%) was achieved in a mixture of 80 vol% CO2 and 20 vol% N2.
(b) Role of sulfur-containing functional groups. 
A dopant other than nitrogen, sulfur is much larger and therefore can emerge out of the graphene plane, leading to the generation of strain as well as defects within the framework. This may result in charge localization which favors CO2 adsorption capacity.185,186 Kiciński et al.187 discussed the effect of S-doping and observed an increase in local reactivity which occurs due to S-atom donation of the electron's lone pair. There exist strong acid–base interactions among C–S functional groups and CO2 molecules along with pole–pole interactions due to polar S-groups and quadrupole moment of CO2. These interactions suggest that doping with S-functional groups in carbon materials could significantly influence CO2 adsorption capacity.188 In general, S-doped carbons can be realized by carbonization following activation (for porosity development) of precursors enriched with sulfur functional groups. Of note, just like the N-doping of porous carbons, the process of activation to produce porosity will eventually reduce the S-content in the final carbon product. For sulfur doping, the sulfonic acid groups act as active sites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can be used to quantify sulfur groups (e.g., –SO3H) which show a spectrum peak around 169 eV in the S 2p spectrum. These groups can also be determined by TPD upon decomposing into SO2 and SO moieties between 200 and 400 °C.189,190
(c) Role of nitrogen and sulfur co-doped functional groups. 
In a study, Shi et al.180 reported hierarchical porous carbon formation from wastepaper (Fig. 11(c)). In this work, hydrothermally treated wastepaper was carbonized and activated simultaneously using KOH and ZnCl2 as activating agents. Then, nitrogen and sulfur were co-doped to obtain porous activated carbon using thiourea as a nitriding and sulfurizing agent. Importantly, it was observed that narrow micropores were predominantly generated by KOH activation and wider mesopores originated from ZnCl2 activation. Abundant micropores (<1 nm), high SSA (2040 m2 g−1), optimal nitrogen (4.32 wt%) and sulfur (1.16 wt%) content led to a well-developed hierarchical porous network formation. The optimized material exhibited high CO2 uptake of 7.76 and 5.19 mmol g−1 at 0 and 25 °C and 1 bar, which is promising for CO2 capture in post-combustion flue gases. The authors concluded that the excellent CO2 adsorption performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of nitrogen and sulfur doping and the abundance of ultra-micropores. Low isosteric heats of adsorption, facile regeneration and cost-effective synthesis make wastepaper-derived porous carbons efficient CO2 adsorbents.
Moving on, our group27 has recently demonstrated shrimp shell-derived N,S co-doped porous carbons as efficient CO2 adsorbents [Fig. 12]. Fig. 12(a) illustrates the synthetic protocol, with SEM images (Fig. 12(b)) showing morphological analysis for the prepared carbons. The prepared carbons show excellent CO2 and N2 capture performance, with the maximum value reaching 236.8 mg g−1 at 273 K per 1 bar (Fig. 12(c)) and IAST selectivity up to 84.3 (Fig. 12(e and f)). The Horvath–Kawazoe (HK) method was also employed to determine the ultramicropore volume responsible for remarkable CO2 adsorption, as shown in Fig. 12(d). The authors have indicated that the excellent CO2 adsorption and separation performance of the prepared carbons are ascribed to the synergistic role of narrow pores (<1 nm) and optimum N- and S-content.

(d) Role of oxygen-containing functional groups. 
The biomass-derived carbons used for CO2 adsorption purposes are highly dependent on their surface properties. The porous carbons can be completely amorphous or graphitic, and there exist unsaturated carbon atoms at the graphene layers’ edges as well as in basal plane defects which react with oxygen, nitrogen, and water molecules, resulting in the formation of surface functional groups, as illustrated in Fig. 13. These functional groups can act as anchor sites for holding CO2 molecules.191 Among various functional groups such as oxygenated, anhydrides, and carboxylic acids, lactols, lactones, and phenols are categorized as acidic, whereas ether groups and carbonyl are considered neutral or could produce basic structures in terms of chromene, quinone, and pyrone groups. Moreover, the π electrons that exist in basal planes can also significantly contribute toward the basicity of carbons, impacting overall adsorption performance.192 As a result of the oxidation of carbon materials, various O-functional groups can be attached over carbon surfaces, imparting electron acceptor characteristics. In addition, the extent of hydrophilicity of carbon materials is strongly impacted by the quantity of polar O-functional groups present, as pristine carbon has a hydrophobic character. Hydrophilicity is, however, unfavorable for CO2 adsorption as it generates a competing environment between flue gas moisture and CO2 molecules over active adsorption sites.185 These O-groups attached over carbon surfaces can be decomposed and release CO, CO2, and H2O at various temperature ranges: e.g. (i) at a low-temperature range between 100–450 °C, the carboxylic acids release CO2; (ii) in an intermediate temperature range of 350–600 °C, anhydrides release CO + CO2; (iii) for temperatures between 500–750 °C, phenols release CO; (iv) at higher temperatures of 650–950 °C, carbonyls release CO; and (v) lactones decompose into CO2 at 550–800 °C. To calculate the amount of individual functional groups, TPD (temperature-programmed desorption) can be used by deconvoluting CO and CO2 peaks.193 A lot of research has been conducted which indicates that O-functional groups do have an important impact on BPC's CO2 adsorption performance. Tiwari et al.194 reported that the highest CO2 adsorption performance in epoxy resin-derived porous carbons was credited to a large amount of O-involving basic groups. Oxygen-comprised functional groups, for instance, alcohols, carbonyls, and ethers consist of electron-giving O-atoms which contribute electrostatic interactions with CO2 molecules, leading to improved CO2 adsorption through Lewis acid–base interactions.195,196 The basicity of other groups like –COOH and –OH contribute positively to improving Lewis acid–base interactions between CO2 molecules and these groups.197,198 In another report, Yuan et al.199 found that –OH groups increase interactions among PET-derived porous carbons and CO2 molecules. On the other hand, the author demonstrated no role played by ether groups in CO2 adsorption; instead they observed a reduced CO2 capacity, owing to the pore blockage characteristic of ether groups.

In general, chemical or physical activation processes are used to oxidize the carbon structures to produce O-functional groups over their surfaces.97 Budinova et al.201 demonstrated that basic groups could be produced over carbon surfaces more effectively under steam activation rather than inert (N2) atmosphere. Moreover, it has been found that a high pyrolysis temperature (900 °C) is detrimental to surface groups and reduces overall heteroatom (O, N, S) content over the carbon surfaces.202 Therefore, lower pyrolysis, as well as activation temperature, is required to adequately achieve the heteroatom content for achieving excellent CO2 adsorption performance in biomass-derived porous carbons. Moving on, liquid-phase oxidation was also found to increase higher O-content largely as carboxylic groups as compared with gas-phase oxidation, which mostly contains carbonyl and ether functionalities. NaOH activation was also found to strongly increase surface basicity as compared with H3PO4 under the same processing conditions (850 °C).
(e) Metal–oxide doping. 
Another strategy to enhance the CO2 adsorption capacity of activated porous carbons is to functionalize them with metal atoms. As a result of metal functionalization, more active surface sites will be produced which offer anchoring/holding sites to CO2 molecules and finally increase overall CO2 uptake capacity. In this regard, only a few reports have been published demonstrating the impact of metal functionalization on CO2 capacity. For instance, Liu et al.203 used tobacco stem as a carbon precursor and produced oxygen-rich porous carbon (OC) by adding 10 g of tobacco stem into 100 mL of a mixture of DI water and K2CO3 (50 g). This mixture was stirred for 24 h and then filtered and dried. After that, the dried material was put in a tube furnace at 500 °C for 1 h under an N2 environment, finally resulting in a black residue. The black residue was washed with HCl and DI water for several rounds before it was filtered and dried. This final carbonized product was called “OC”. Next, this OC material was stirred for several hours in 100 mL of 0.1 M alkali solution (KOH, NaOH, and LiOH) and then washed with DI water, filtered, and dried to achieve alkali metal-functionalized porous carbons (MOC; where M indicate different metals). From the results, it has been found that alkali metals are uniformly dispersed in the carbon framework and do not change pore size distribution and the original amorphous nature of OC; however, a slight reduction in surface area was found. From the adsorption experiments based on static adsorption and dynamic breakthrough using CO2/N2 (15/85, v/v), a significant increase in CO2 capture and separation was realized as a result of alkali metal doping. Lithium-doped OC presented the highest CO2 uptake (4.1 mmol g−1 at 25 °C) along with the highest CO2/N2 selectivity of 47. Based on DFT and Monte Carlo simulation, the authors demonstrated that alkali metal-doped carbons possessed larger binding energy as well as stronger CO2 adsorption as compared with N2 doping. In another study, Zhu et al.164 used pine cones as carbon precursors and KOH as a chemical activating agent. The authors prepared activated porous carbons at 700 °C with a KOH impregnation ratio of two. The final product contained both calcium and nitrogen metals, each with 0.5% of the total content. The porous carbon demonstrated excellent CO2 adsorption of 4.7 mmol g−1 at 25 °C. However, the value of adsorption capacities varied significantly based on the utilization of different activation temperatures and impregnation ratios. In another report by the same group,204 an enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity was realized using activation of London plane leaves by KOH. The prepared porous carbons possessed a well-dispersed amount of metals such as Mg and Ca. The realization of excellent CO2 capacity was attributed to high specific surface area (>2000 m2 g−1) as well as larger content of micropores. These metal-functionalized porous carbons also demonstrated excellent performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), signifying their importance for multistate applications for CO2 capture/separation and energy devices.

5. Mechanism of CO2 capture
Biomass resources consist of N, S, or P heteroatoms and several inorganic compounds in their structures, depending upon their compositional matrix which varies for different biomass feedstocks. The presence of diverse structures and different properties of biochar are highly dependent on biomass feedstocks as well as pyrolysis conditions. Therefore, it is imperative to understand and evaluate the relationship between pyrolysis conditions and resultant physicochemical properties for designing/synthesizing optimum biochar to observe excellent CO2 adsorption performance. CO2 adsorption can occur as physisorption, chemisorption, or a mixture of both (Fig. 14). In general, carbon-based materials govern CO2 physisorption via van der Waals interactions with CO2 molecules and the surface of materials, whereas CO2 chemisorption occurs via chemical reactions between CO2 molecules and metal oxides and amine-containing adsorbents surfaces. Typically, one CO2 chemically reacts with two amine functional groups over a biochar surface via a zwitterion mechanism, resulting in the production of ammonia pairs and carbamate.205

5.1. CO2 physisorption mechanism over activated biochars
The pyrolysis process as well as activation conditions can alter the surface area and the porosity in the biochar. Additionally, physicochemical characteristics related to biochar are varied by regulating pyrolysis conditions, utilizing different activating agents and activation methods, and choosing diverse biomass precursors. Biomass pyrolysis at temperatures ≥450 °C under an N2 or Ar environment resulted in highly porous carbon-enriched biochar owing to the thermal vaporization of volatile matters contained in biomass.18 Typically, physical and chemical activation of biochar leads to the development of a high surface area and larger porosity with controlled pore size. Both physical and chemical activation methods possess two basic steps: i.e., biomass carbonization using pyrolysis processes at a temperature of 300–900 °C, with subsequent activation using oxidants at a temperature of 500–900 °C.206
Over a solid surface of any kind, CO2 interacts with intermolecular forces, e.g., van der Waal forces. If there are no heteroatom or metal atoms over the carbon material surface, there would be no chemical interaction due to the absence of chemical bonds, thus interaction will be governed by simple condensation principles in a layer-by-layer deposition manner. This is known as CO2 capture by the physisorption mechanism (Fig. 15(a)). In this case, CO2 adsorption is favorable on pore walls. This will result in a steep increase of adsorption capacity until the pore is filled, e.g., in the case of the micropore. On the other hand, in the case of the mesopore, there exist two similar steep curves: the first is micropore filling, whereas the second is the remaining opening of the micropore itself. Filling of this second pore is defined as pore condensation, a significant phenomenon responsible for remarkable gas uptake. It is important to understand the behavior of CO2 adsorption in mesopores as there exist one or more such events in any size of pores.

(b) CO2 adsorption isotherm on a hierarchical nanoporous carbon (HNC) at 298 K/1 bar, (c) experimental setup for 13CO2 gas dosing into NMR samples, and (d)NMR spectra obtained by direct excitation over 13CO2-loaded HNC at pressure of 755 mbar.

To investigate the mechanism of CO2 adsorption, Creamer et al.208 evaluated the CO2 capture performance of sugarcane bagasse and hickory wood-derived non-activated carbons, finding that physisorption due to weak van der Waals interactions drives CO2 adsorption. Additionally, the quadrupole moment of CO2 molecules appears to enhance surface interactions between gas molecules and the biochar surface. Importantly, the textural features of biochar play a predominant role in controlling the physisorption of CO2 molecules. Similarly, Martinez et al.209 prepared several physically activated carbon materials and demonstrated that the CO2 adsorption mechanism is dependent on the size and shape of the micropores. Furthermore, they confirmed that physical adsorption plays a crucial role in filling narrow micropores.
Mao et al.207 reported hierarchical nanoporous carbon (HNC) and studied its CO2 adsorption capacity along with its physisorbed molecular mechanism using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), as presented in Fig. 15(b–d). The calculated CO2 adsorption capacity (Fig. 15(a)) of HNC was around 4.3 mmol g−1 at 298 K/ per 1 bar. Fig. 15(b) demonstrates an experimental setup used for 3CO2 gas dosing into NMR samples. The obtained NMR result (Fig. 15(c)) demonstrated a 13C MAS spectra for 13CO2-dosed HNC sample which provides evidence that CO2 adsorption occurred via physisorption on the HNC sample. Additionally, CO2 adsorption occurs in micro-, and mesopores of the HNC sample with CO2 molecules attached to aromatic rings of HNC.
Moving on, in another study, Xie et al.210 comprehensively studied the CO2 capture mechanism of N-doped porous carbons using several experimental techniques. From the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst ∼28.6kJ mol−1), the authors inferred the physical adsorption mechanism. In this study, the results of in situ diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy showed two intense peaks at 2200–2400 cm−1 and 3550–3750 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibration of gaseous CO2 and the vibrational overtone band of CO2, respectively, both indicating the physical adsorption peaks of CO2. Additionally, the CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) curve revealed the presence of alkaline sites (pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N) which resulted in the carbamate formation with CO2 molecules. Lastly, the authors presented a virial plot where the appearance of a nonlinear dip angle at a low CO2 uptake region suggests the micropore-filling and CO2-basic sites interaction mechanisms of CO2 adsorption. However, at high CO2 uptake, a saturation of basic sites was observed and CO2 adsorption predominantly takes place by pore filling, which indicates a physical adsorption mechanism.
5.2. CO2 chemisorption mechanism over activated biochars
It is well known that CO2 is a non-polar, linear molecule with a highly stable character having one electropositive atom of carbon and two electronegative atoms of oxygen. The main strategy to activate CO2 for capture/conversion purposes relies on the strength of nucleophilic interactions with the CO2 carbon atom (which is electrophilic).211 Electrophilic substrates e.g., Lewis acids and protons, can activate oxygen atoms of CO2; however, this strategy ends up offering a similar nucleophilic path on the electropositive carbon atom. Therefore, chemisorptive sorbents are strictly dependent on the nucleophilic nature of functional groups. Basicity does help to improve nucleophilicity, but does not improve capture performance directly. The regeneration of adsorbent depends on binding strength, termed Qst. The larger the value of Qst, the stronger the binding strength, and a larger amount of energy is required to regenerate adsorbent material.
5.3. Isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst or ΔHads)
From the literature, it has been witnessed that both the direct method (adsorption calorimetry, Ad-Cal) and the indirect method (where adsorption isotherms can be realized at distinct temperature and pressure) can be used to determine adsorption heats. Both these methods relied on thermodynamics and the Clausius–Clapeyron equation to determine the isosteric heat of adsorption. Using at least two temperatures, the Clausius–Clapeyron equation is the most common way to calculate the isosteric adsorption heats for a given adsorbate. From an energy standpoint, determining isosteric heat can be used to establish surface properties of adsorbents as well as reveal information about their homogeneity or heterogeneity.212
The isosteric heat of adsorption (denoted as Qst or ΔHads) provides a quantitative measure of the binding strength between the adsorbent and the CO2 molecules, which plays a pivotal role in determining the energy penalty for adsorbent regeneration. Rehman et al.24 recently studied ΔHads at various CO2 loadings using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation (eqn (15)), as below: (15)where, T1 (273 K) and T2 (283 K) are used. The obtained data (ΔHadsvs. CO2 uptake) are presented in Fig. 16. The authors claimed ΔHads values in the range of 27.8 to 38.9 kJ mol−1 at near-zero CO2 loading, which is comparable to the majority of the reported biomass-derived carbons (pine cone shell-based activated carbon: max. 32.9 kJ mol−1,213 coffee ground-based microporous carbons: 25.8–40.8 kJ mol−1,214 microporous carbons derived from poplar wood: 21.1–43.2 kJ mol−1,101 pecan nutshell-derived activated carbons: max. 37.4 kJ mol−1,125 and biomass-derived dual-doped (N, S) porous carbons: 19–33 kJ mol−1 (ref. 215)). It is well documented that an isosteric heat value lower or higher than 40 kJ mol−1 is an indication of the existence of either physical adsorption or chemical adsorption mechanism, respectively. With this said, all the aforementioned reports revealed the physisorption adsorption mechanism and suggested a low energy requirement to completely regenerate the spent adsorbents. However, amine-based sorbents demonstrated a significantly higher ΔHads value, usually between 60 and 100 kJ mol−1 or even higher,216,217 revealing a chemisorption mechanism. Such high value means that an ample amount of energy is required to desorb CO2 molecules from an amine surface, making the regeneration process highly energy intensive and costly. From Fig. 16, in the first stage of adsorption, the higher ΔHads value of biomass-derived porous carbons indicates a strong interaction between the gas molecules and the porous carbon network; this is consistent with the quadrupolar interaction between CO2 molecules and ultra-micropores with narrow pore size distribution (0.7 nm).218 ΔHads values decrease with increasing CO2 uptake, envisaging the complete reversible desorption process with minimum energy requirement due to a physical adsorption mechanism. OPMK-900 showed the highest ΔHads (38.9 kJ mol−1), due to its heterogeneous surface containing high pyrrolic-N content and abundant narrow micropores. In particular, at high CO2 loadings, the ΔHads of the OPM sample decreased, while those of all the activated carbons with clearly defined porosities remained moderate. The results of this study prove that narrow microporosity plays a critical role in adsorbing CO2 at a pressure of 1 bar.219

6. CO2 capture approaches
In general, CO2 capture methods can be categorized into the following approaches (Fig. 17):
 (1) Pre-combustion capture
 (2) Post-combustion capture
 (3) Oxy-combustion.
 Fig. 17  CO2 capture approaches; pre-, post-, and oxy-combustion. A block diagram illustration. Reproduced from ref. 221 with permission from [Elsevier], copyright [2008]. 
In the case of pre-combustion, fuel reacts with air, steam, or oxygen to produce mainly carbon monoxide and hydrogen, combined, termed “syngas”. This process is called partial oxidation, gasification, or reforming. Gasification provides a route for transforming coal into a gaseous state where it is further cleaned and can be burned in a gas turbine. Using a water–gas shift reaction, almost all the carbon compounds can be transferred into CO2 and then removed before their dilution at the combustion stage to completely prevent CO2 emissions during gasification in the power plant. To do so, the scrubbing of syngas or the use of any capture technology such as gas separation membrane technology or sorbent technology is required. Interestingly, CO2 capture at larger pressure during the pre-combustion process can transform biochar into a promising CO2 adsorbent on the condition that CO2 separation from syngas is easily accessible. With the significant advantage of the pre-combustion route, the major disadvantage of this strategy is the requirement to cool down syngas to capture CO2 and low efficiency during water–gas shift reaction.220
Moving on, for the case of post-combustion, flue gas releases contain a gas mixture of 3–15% CO2, 70% N2 (based on volume) along with other gas vapors after the fuel combustion process ends.222 During post-combustion, CO2 is removed in the boiler from the flue gas downstream. Technologies such as amine scrubbers have been used at the industrial level to capture CO2 downstream at pollutant control facilities. Despite the excellent potential for CO2 capture, there are several disadvantages of this technique as outlined by the Department of Energy (DOE), such as solvent loss, difficulty in separating CO2 from flue gas, and high cost of CO2 compression from atmospheric pressure to achieve optimum pipeline conditions (2200 psi). Due to lower CO2 affinity over carbon-based materials as well as complex gas separation (mostly separation of CO2 from N2), heteroatom doping or surface functionalization of biochar could improve CO2 adsorption and separation significantly.223–225 In the oxy-combustion approach, pure oxygen is used for fuel combustion instead of air, which results in a larger CO2 concentration in flue gases. Highly concentrated CO2 along with the steam is released in the flue gas. The steam can be easily separated by employing condensation. The advantage of this approach is that flue gas contains over 80% CO concentration, therefore only a simple purification process for CO2 is necessary without the formation of significant NOx pollutants. During the process, sorptive materials are not necessarily required for CO2 adsorption and separation; however, the installation of an air separation system is required, which increases overall expenses for this approach.221
For both pre- and post-combustion approaches, potential biochar for excellent CO2 adsorption should have high thermal and chemical stability, should have larger CO2 adsorption capacity, and must possess high CO2 selectivity over other gases such as N2, CH4, H2, etc. To achieve this goal, an adsorbent must have a large specific surface area, optimum surface functionalization, higher volume of micropores and mesopores, and elemental composition.206
7. Factors affecting the performance of BPCs
7.1. Role of higher carbon content in feedstocks
Typically, the physicochemical characteristics of feedstock strongly influence the structural and textural features of BPCs. Zhu et al.226 collected data from several reports and devised a correlation of CO2 uptake capacity with fixed carbon content, carbon content, moisture content, ash content, and volatile content. The authors demonstrated a significant correlation between CO2 uptake with C content and fixed carbon content, illustrating an increasing trend. The presence of larger carbon content increases interactions among CO2 molecules and adsorbent surfaces via strong London dispersion forces, eventually stimulating the adsorption process. On the other hand, increasing moisture content will drastically decrease CO2 uptake capacity. Furthermore, there is no evident correlation between CO2 adsorption and ash and volatile content. Of note, during the process of adsorbent preparation, their final yield decreases due to volatilization and water evaporation of sufficient biomass content, which results in an indirect reduction of CO2 adsorption capacity. Therefore, it is suggested to choose biomass feedstock that have greater C element and fixed carbon content along with lower moisture content for the preparation of BPCs for later testing as excellent CO2 adsorbents.
7.2. Role of pyrolysis/carbonization temperature
The pyrolysis/carbonization temperature significantly influences the textural and adsorption characteristics of BPCs. The optimum value of temperature to achieve maximum CO2 adsorption capacity was found to be 530 °C−610 °C, based on most of the reports.27,92,100,111,215,227 When the temperature exceeds this temperature range, CO2 adsorption decreases. This is ascribed to the fact that upon increasing temperature, more feedstock matter will be volatile, leading to enhanced SSA of BPCs. Most of the developed pores may agglomerate, reducing overall microporous content in the BPCs which is necessary to hold CO2 molecules. This will eventually result in reduced CO2 uptake capacity.227 Therefore, 530 °C–610 °C is the optimized pyrolysis/carbonization temperature for the processing of biomass feedstocks to transform them into BPCs.
7.3. Role of processing time
Along with the optimum temperature, the processing time is also an important factor that influences the physicochemical as well as CO2 adsorption properties of BPCs. A longer processing time increases the porosity as well as the surface area of the prepared BPCs. For instance, Ogungbenro et al.228 synthesized date seeds-derived ACs based on CO2 activation. The authors thoroughly studied the influence of different temperature and activation time conditions on the textural and CO2 adsorption properties of the prepared BPCs. The authors demonstrated an increase in surface area and pore volume with activation time. A longer processing time might develop a highly porous framework owing to the removal of organic or volatile substances, indirectly enhancing CO2 adsorption capacity. However, a prolonged time treatment was also found to result in pore collapse, leading to reduced surface area and pore volume.95
7.4. Role of pore volume and specific surface area
The debate over the dependence of CO2 adsorption on SSA and pore volume for prepared BPCs is ongoing, and which factor (SSA or pore volume) plays the leading role in CO2 adsorption is not very clear. However, several studies elucidate the obvious role played by these factors. For instance, Liu et al.229 have shown that by increasing the SSA of the adsorbent, the number of active sites will be increased which are necessary to hold CO2 molecules over its surface, resulting in improved CO2 adsorption. Pore volume (especially micropore volume) was also found to play a dominant role in CO2 adsorption. Since the micropore size is very near to the molecular diameter of CO2 (0.33 nm), therefore a strong adsorption potential could exist due to van der Waals forces produced by neighboring walls of micropores, which could attract more CO2 molecules. Thus, the adsorbents having larger content of micropores demonstrated excellent CO2 adsorption.230,231 Under ambient conditions, CO2 molecules get adsorbed over adsorbent surfaces via physical adsorption.88,219
7.5. Role of activating agent and impregnation ratio
The use of different activating agents e.g., KOH, K2CO3, K2C2O4, H3PO4, ZnCl2, etc. during the synthesis of BPCs leads to diverse textural features and CO2 adsorption performances. Nazir et al.88 used potassium salts (KOH, K2CO3, and K2C2O4) activation to synthesize corn-starch-based porous carbons to eventually test them for CO2 capacity performance. The authors demonstrated a reasonable SSA ∼1795 m2 g−1, micropore volume ∼0.82 cm3 g−1 and CO2 adsorption 258.20 mg g−1 at 0 °C per 1 bar for KOH-activated samples as compared with K2C2O4-activated samples (SSA ∼1747 m2 g−1, pore volume ∼0.93 cm3 g−1, CO2 adsorption 269.61 mg g−1 at 0 °C per 1 bar), and K2CO3-activated samples (SSA ∼1319 m2 g−1, pore volume ∼0.81 cm3 g−1, CO2 adsorption 256.47 mg g−1 at 0 °C per 1 bar). It is obvious that using various activating agents, different textural features and CO2 adsorption performance can be realized. This signifies the importance and choice of optimum activating agent during the synthesis of BPCs. In addition, the impregnation ratio of activating agent also influences the overall CO2 adsorption performance. In general, on increasing the impregnation ratio, several functional groups increase, which improves the surface area and pore volume.232 However, a significantly large impregnation ratio could result in pore blockage or pore collapse, and deteriorate overall CO2 adsorption.77,233
7.6. Role of CO2 adsorption temperature and pressure during measurement
The CO2 adsorption temperature (normally 0 °C, 10 °C, and 25 °C) plays a significant role during measurement, and it has an inverse relationship with CO2 adsorption capacity: i.e., the higher the adsorption temperature, the lower the CO2 adsorption capacity will be.234 This is credited to the exothermic process of CO2 adsorption by BPCs. Additionally, upon increasing adsorption temperature, the diffusion CO2 molecules over adsorbent surfaces becomes overwhelmed, restricting further molecules from being adsorbed. Thus, CO2 adsorption should be carried out at under 50 °C to achieve maximum capacity. Moving on, in the case of pressure, CO2 adsorption increases as pressure rises. This increases the interaction strength between adsorbent active sites and CO2 molecules, leading to higher CO2 adsorption. In general, the adsorption capacity does not get saturated at pressure reaching 1 bar. This indicates that adsorption will continue at greater pressure. Thus, most BPCs possess the potential for high-pressure CO2 adsorption.
8. Current challenges
The following are the prominent challenges for CO2 capture.
(1) Sorbent
The major challenge in synthesizing/designing sorbent material is that it must be able to demonstrate high CO2 uptake capacity as well as excellent selectivity from other gases, particularly in the presence of water vapors under flue gas conditions. Typically, the attrition index and synthesis of pellets, which are crucially important aspects, are not considered at all. Additionally, limited finances hinder the employment of common metals during sorbent synthesis. Moreover, atom economy while synthesizing porous carbons is a required factor. Furthermore, the lower productivity or yield of sorbents limit their large-scale application, therefore it is necessary to optimize the synthesis process as well as make a suitable choice of biomass precursor to increase the overall yield for future commercialization.
(2) Regulating the material's structure
It is necessary to regulate the material's structure to achieve ultimate CO2 capture goals. A biomass material must have an ideal structure with the useful chemical composition necessary to adsorb CO2 molecules over its surface. It is significantly important to use different organic/inorganic materials which possess nanostructures to modify the textural as well as functional properties of activated BPCs to boost carbon materials-based CO2 adsorption-type commercial activity.
(3) Finding effective and environmentally benign activation methods
Currently, most of the methods used for the synthesis of activated BPCs generate undesirable chemicals and a significant amount of carbon emissions. Thus, it is necessary to find a novel and environmentally benign activation process for the preparation of BPCs.
(4) Storage
With the enormous amount of CO2 emission, progress in storage designs and related strategies is becoming day-by-day more expensive. Moreover, most CO2 storage areas are in geological formation sites, posing a serious challenge for continuous monitoring, verification, and assessment to safeguard CO2 trapped underground.
(5) Sorbent recyclability
The challenging problem of amine solution-based sorbents (e.g., ethanolamine: MEA) is their low recycling properties. To overcome this discrepancy, biomass-derived porous solid sorbents demonstrate higher reusability without compromising their adsorption characteristics. Although these are not technologically competitive with well-established zeolite-based sorbents, they are a highly applicable industrial technology for gas and solvent purification owing to their remarkable recyclability over 1000 cycles. However, significant development is underway to derive BPCs with higher recycling properties. One point to consider is that the heat of adsorption of the developed carbons must be of a low to moderate level. Under ideal conditions, a solid sorbent must demonstrate a CO2 cycling value of 1000 cycles with a capacity retention maintained over 90%.235
(6) Sorbent thermal and chemical stability
The thermal stability of the sorbent is critically important, especially for pre-combustion or oxy-fuel CO2 capture, as in these approaches a higher gas adsorption/separation temperature is involved as compared with the post-combustion approach. Moving on, CO2 sorbents that have a larger value of heat of adsorption (Qst > 50 kJ mol−1) require higher temperatures for desorption purposes (>120 °C). Considering the oxidative environment, sorbents should be thermally stable until 150 °C for post-combustion CO2 capture, whereas these must demonstrate a thermally stable nature for a temperature range of 350–400 °C for pre-combustion or oxy-fuel CO2 capture approaches. Sorbents that have greater thermal stability can demonstrate higher recyclability and can also degrade if exposed to prolonged heating even at a lower temperature range of 100–150 °C. Thus, it is necessary to verify the thermal degradation properties of porous materials, particularly those with the presence of organic building blocks.
Other than thermal stability, a potential CO2 sorbent must demonstrate chemical stability. Therefore, biomass-derived porous carbon must maintain its structural integrity under acidic flue gas flow conditions. During the synthesis of the sorbent, one should consider that these materials will undergo a flue gas condition that contains not only water vapors but also acidic gases, for instance, hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide. Therefore, these materials must possess abundant porous networks and stable CO2 philic functionalities for excellent CO2 capture performance. Additionally, the sorbent materials must be checked for oxidative stability before their usage as CO2 adsorbing material, as in the presence of 4% oxygen in flue gas at elevated temperature oxidation can occur for CO2 philic functionalities.
9. Trending carbon capture technologies
Other than porous carbon-based CO2 adsorption, there are other technologies such as electrochemical and membrane-based systems that have been recently exploited for CO2 capture.236 These approaches require further development in many aspects before their implementation on a large scale. In this regard, machine learning (ML) methods could significantly play an important role to improve these processes. Gas separation via membrane is a very attractive method particularly useful for low carbon emission technologies, owing to its ability to be operated as a continuous system, rather than traditional batch systems, for instance, absorption and adsorption. For this reason membrane technology is preferred by industry as it significantly reduces overall production cost. In terms of operation, membrane selectivity allows the desired gas to pass through while retaining the unwanted ones, leading to the separation of gases from the feeding mixture. This technology has attracted huge attention and researchers are now developing a unique modular system that has the ability to separate out CO2 among various sources.237 The primary features associated with membranes, such as durability, selectivity, and cost, are correlated with the structural characteristics of membranes via the trained ML method. Such a relationship can guide the researcher to understand the impact of these characteristics on membrane properties, and therefore allow them to design cost-effective, highly stable (over the longer operational period), and selective CO2 membranes.
On a similar note, electrochemical systems fabricated and employed for CO2 capture have been emerging as a unique approach that has the ability to separate CO2via reversible cycles with a need for energy comparable to contemporary thermal processes.238 Owing to their electrical operation, many renewable energy sources, e.g., wind and solar, can be exploited to fulfill their energy demands, offering a unique approach for CO2 capture without any significant carbon footprint. Industrial flue gas and dilute air streams have been introduced as excellent electrochemical approaches; however, these systems still need aggressive development.239 To further enhance the capacity and performance of these systems, machine learning could play a significant role. The advancement can further be achieved by developing absorbent systems, improving cell configuration, electrodes, and enhancing stability and CO2 capture rates as well as energy penalties.
Recently, Zhu et al.240 reported a comprehensive model that describes the quantitative structure–property relationship based on datasets of 155 porous carbon materials and 6244 related CO2 adsorptions to forecast the CO2 capture capacity and analyze the importance of other physicochemical parameters. Fig. 18(a) demonstrates the machine learning setup used to evaluate appropriate parameters that can guide the researchers regarding what to look for before synthesizing porous carbon materials. The authors stressed that textural features are relatively more significant than the chemical composition of porous materials for any change in CO2 capture capacity. At first, a statistical tool, for instance Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) analysis, was adopted to preliminarily visualize the linear relationship among any two variables. After that, machine learning was used to determine the relationship of CO2 capture capacity with adsorption conditions and materials characteristics. Several machine learning algorithms such as decision tree and random forest (RF) can calculate the complex relationship between a number of influencing parameters and dependent variables. Fig. 18(b) illustrates PCC among any two features of porous carbons, any variable, and CO2 capture performance using overall adsorption data. Interestingly, at low pressure of 0.1 bar, pore volume of both micro- and mesopores played a vital role as suggested by RF analysis; however, it had a negative relationship with CO2 capture according to PCC analysis. As pressure increases, the relative importance of narrow micropores increases. Fig. 18(c) demonstrates the highly influential parameters observed during the study. Based on pressure range, porous carbons demonstrate different parameters that influence their overall CO2 adsorption performance.

Storing CO2 in underground geological formations or other secure storage sites where it will not contribute to climate change is the goal of carbon capture and storage (CCS). The purpose of CCS is to lessen atmospheric CO2 emissions, which are a major cause of global warming. On the other hand, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) involves re-utilizing the captured CO2 in the manufacturing of chemicals, fuels, and construction materials. CCU's ultimate objective is to establish a regenerative economic system in which CO2 emissions are not only mitigated but also utilized to produce useful products. Moreover, the energy-intensive processes of CO2 desorption, absorbent regeneration, and CO2 transportation and disposal in geological cavities, oceans, or elsewhere could be avoided by converting CO2 into a feedstock for producing useful commodity chemicals under mild conditions.
In general, CO2 utilization/conversion aims to capture and valorize atmospheric CO2 to valuable products (Fig. 19) using the cradle-to-cradle principle, thereby increasing the possibility of closing the carbon loop.241 Recently, researchers have been more focused on CO2 conversion to C1–C2 chemicals (CH4, CO, HCHO, CH3OH, HCOOH, and C2H5OH).242–244 Generally, high energy is required to reduce CO2 owing to higher bond dissociation energy of CO (750 kJ mol−1) than that of C–C (336 kJ mol−1) and C–H (430 kJ mol−1).245 Different approaches used for CO2 reduction include thermocatalytic, electrocatalytic, and photocatalytic CO2 conversion/reduction.246–248 The thermocatalytic CO2 reduction process has some limitations such as high costs, low carbonation rates, and large energy penalties which make this method less effective. On the other hand, electrocatalytic reduction is an efficient way to reduce CO2 together with providing an effective mean to extract energy from renewable resources and lock it up in chemical bonds. Moreover, photocatalysis, also known as artificial photosynthesis, is a promising method for converting CO2 to renewable solar fuels. Photodriven CO2 conversion has numerous advantages, including easy reduction driven by an inexhaustible solar energy, mild reaction conditions, and readily available reactants (H2O and anthropogenic CO2). Of note, CO2 conversion to solar fuel and energy-enriched hydrocarbons without secondary pollution is a promising means of recycling renewable carbon. However, CO2 reduction is a kinetically and thermodynamically slow process, so catalysts are always needed to speed up the process. In recent decades, there has been a surge in research on catalyzed CO2 reduction. Among various materials used for CO2 ad/absorption and activation, ionic liquids (IL) are considered as one of the promising green media; they consist of cations and anions and exhibit intriguing features including non-volatile nature, tunable polarity and remarkable stability.249 ILs, more specifically task-specific ionic liquids (TSILs) such as amino-functionalized ILs and superbase-derived protic ILs, are widely used in CO2 conversion as absorbents, catalysts or promoters. In general, reactions containing CO2 are carried out at high pressure, which is economically unfavorable and poses safety concerns. Therefore, it is a challenging task to design catalysts for CO2 activation at low pressure (∼1 atm) followed by incorporation of CO2 into organic molecules. In this regard, TSILs are a promising candidate for capturing CO2 and activating it for subsequent chemical transformation to useful chemicals (at 1 atm), and getting rid of the energy-intensive desorption step. Different valuable compounds synthesized in the presence of TSILs as catalysts/reaction media include organic carbonates, oxazolidinones, urea derivatives, and formic acid.

Moreover, utilizing anthropogenic solid wastes for CCU is another effective way to mitigate global warming. Of note, several solid wastes including fly ash and biomass upon modification with amines or heteroatoms are capable of excellent CO2 capture at relatively low temperature.250 Such solid adsorbents are one of the ideal candidates for CCU where captured CO2, also considered as activated CO2, is chemically transformed to value-added chemicals under mild conditions, thereby avoiding an additional desorption step. Meanwhile, CaO-containing waste is also being used in Ca-looping system for high-temperature CO2 capture. Despite huge progress made, more rigorous benchmarking research studies for upscaling the CO2 utilization technologies are still needed.
10. Conclusion and future research direction
Great progress has been made over the years in terms of technological and industrial developments. These advancements have led to fast consumption of natural resources including coal, oil, and natural gas to meet rising energy demands. In addition to depleting energy sources, burning fossil fuels increases the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming. To meet energy demands and maintain the environment, researchers have focused on developing alternative clean energy sources. For this purpose, research efforts have been devoted to biomass utilization as an economical pathway for renewable energy production, gas and energy storage, water purification, and catalysis. The existence of millions of tons of natural biomass motivates the scientific community to consider the principles of a circular economy, where recycling and transformation of biomass to other energy sources take place without threatening the environment. Biomass can be transformed into useful products by physical, chemical, or biological transformation methods, resulting in the development of innovative materials, new business opportunities, and improved living standards.
Herein, we reviewed the various biomass sources and detailed the processing methods and techniques used to transform these materials into activated carbons and other useful materials. Various conversion methods such as physico-chemical and thermo-chemical were discussed in detail. After describing the successful conversion of biomass into porous activated carbons with high specific surface area, we assessed their use as efficient CO2 adsorbents. From the literature, it is evident that highly porous ACs are widely applicable for gas storage and separation, energy storage, wastewater treatment, and catalysis in biodiesel formation. Despite the numerous benefits offered by biomass-derived materials in such applications, this field is far from realizing its full potential due to limited and cost-consuming processing methods, inefficient purification techniques, limited product yields, energy–cost imbalance, and social stigma. To maximize the utility of biomass, these challenges must be addressed. Additionally, an abundance of non-degradable biomass/biowaste is one of the primary contributors to environmental pollution. Therefore, new methods to process non-degradable products and recycle these materials in an eco-friendly manner must be developed.
It is highly desirable to design porous activated carbon materials with tunable porosity. Well-defined and tunable porosity can alter the performance of fabricated materials as CO2 adsorbents. Thus, further work is required to enhance the performance of biomass-derived carbon materials in comparison with polymer-derived carbons, metal–organic frameworks, zeolites, carbon nanotubes, and graphene. Additionally, a great deal of effort is still required to optimize the basic processes and methods to attain high yields. This requires collaborations between scientists from materials engineering, environmental chemistry, physics, economics, and social sciences. This comprehensive review article will serve to increase the understanding of biomass sources, types, and processing methods and inspire novel approaches and industrial-scale applications.
The worldwide abundance of renewable biomass with rich carbon content could provide a significant amount of raw material to develop future carbon materials for realizing diverse applications. Particularly, activated BPCs with highly porous networks have become increasingly exciting materials to address both environmental and energy crises. Numerous studies have been conducted on the synthetic protocols and related environmental applications, for instance, CO2 adsorption and separation which have been thoroughly elaborated in the present review. Despite significant advancement in synthetic protocols and related CO2 adsorption performance, there still exist some obstacles, for instance, high production costs due to the involvement of the high-temperature pyrolysis step. Therefore, the development of cost-effective production routes which require less energy is an important research topic at the current time. In this regard, solar energy can be utilized to improve the pyrolysis process. Additionally, the development of better activating agents, as well as self-activation systems, can reduce the cost penalty significantly.
Biomass feedstocks having various natural features, synthetic conditions, and production strategies could significantly influence the textural and physicochemical properties of the finally prepared activated BPCs. Therefore, the selection of suitable raw materials with optimal components and optimization of synthetic parameters as well as production routes to precisely synthesize BPCs whose properties can be tailored to achieve specific applications will be a burning research topic in the future. Another hot research topic will be tuning the textural feature of BPCs by mixing them with catalysts or other materials to produce a hybrid-type material that must have improved textural as well as CO2 adsorption/separation characteristics compared with the individual components. Most of the current BPCs have been developed for electrochemical energy storage applications; however, it is critically important to seek other applications, e.g., as adsorbents for greenhouse gases, for photocatalysis, and as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It is interesting to consider that biomass does not contain toxic elements, heavy metals, or other harmful materials that could degrade environmental safety; however, other pollutants such as organic/inorganic types can be produced during the synthesis of BPCs from biomass, thus during the use of these BPCs, the environmental risks cannot be overlooked. Therefore, another future research area could be designed on exploring heavy metals’ impact on BPCs while using these as environmental remediation materials. To remove the heavy metals from BPCs, strong acid or other reagent solutions can be utilized to leach BPCs to finally obtain recovery or desorption of heavy metals. Additionally, another useful technique is the pyrolysis of biomass, which could also recover heavy metals. The recycling efficiency of BPCs is also an important research area that should be focused on. By magnetizing BPCs, most of the content can be recovered, particularly in the environmental protection field. To seek industrial large-scale applications, raw biomass should possess strong reproducibility. Future research could focus on finding such BPCs that could showcase large scalability using the established template method. Additionally, machine learning-derived methods can be designed and scrutinized to explore the critical factors that impact CO2 adsorption capacity, and therefore provide precise guidance to the researcher for the synthesis and development of BPCs.
