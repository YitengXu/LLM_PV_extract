    , Accepted 8th June 2017First published on 9th June 2017AbstractA heterojunction photo-conductive ultraviolet (UV) detector was developed based on TiO2 nanowires array (NWA) surrounded by N,N′-bis-(1-naphthalenyl)-N,N′-bis-phenyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (NPB). The novel and effective two-step method of static infusion and dynamic solution-cleaning was employed to fill NPB into TiO2 NWA gaps and simultaneously remove the unwelcomed top NPB layer. The device fabricated via the two-step method exhibited optimal performance compared to TiO2/NPB device with top NPB layer and TiO2 NWA device. In dark conditions, the TiO2/NPB heterojunction device without top NPB was found to possess the capacity of depleting majority carriers, thereby providing improved dark-resistivity to limit the dark current (Id). Under UV illumination, the depleting effect could be eliminated by the dissociation and accumulation of photo-generated carriers between pn heterojunction, leading to increased carrier density and photo-conductivity. It cleared up the high barrier due to the removal of top NPB layer, which was beneficial for hot electron transport than the device with top NPB layer under illumination, thereby achieving an enhanced light current (Il) to Id ratio of 1.67 × 104. A simple technology is provided to prepare organic–inorganic hybrid one-dimensional array heterostructure, which plays a remarkable role in the working of the UV detector, enhancing photo-conductivity and dark-resistivity of the device.
Introduction
Rapid progress in ultraviolet (UV) detection research demands strong advances in achieving high light current (Il), low dark current (Id) as well as fast response speed.1–3 Achievement of high Il is critical in fabricating a detector with high responsivity.4,5 Realization of low Id is also vital while preparing a device with high signal-to-noise ratio and detectivity.6,7 Even though both play significant roles in UV detection, the devices with low Id possess a potential to further decrease the detection limit of light intensity and demonstrates broader application prospects.8–10 The Id of wide band-gap semiconductor UV detectors mainly consists of extrinsic majority carrier current induced by defect/trap in materials and hot carrier current injected from electrode under the applied bias.11–13 To suppress the Id of devices, the depleting effect was found to be a reasonable and effective method, which has become a subject of intense study recently. Gate voltage was employed to deplete the majority carriers in the absence of illumination, thereby decreasing the extrinsic majority carrier density in photo-sensitive materials.14,15 However, the applied gate voltage always exists without the selectivity of light or dark. Thus, the depleting effect also occurs under illumination and decreases the photo-response. Moreover, the presence of gate voltage inevitably brings more device energy cost.16,17 The Schottky junction and pn heterojunction diodes play a significant role in limiting Id and noise, which leads to high injection or transmission barrier to block the hot carriers.18–20 Simultaneously, the as-produced built-in electric field (Ebi) and depletion region could effectively deplete the majority carriers of semiconductors. However, the missing light gain is a serious drawback, which is a major reason for the lower Il to Id ratio and is verified in this study. In addition, the photo-conductive devices modified by heterogeneous materials also display the properties of low Id and high light gain, such as the devices based on epitaxial TiO2/SnO2 branched nanostructure,21 electrospun ZnO–SnO2 heterojunction nanofibers,22 and some organic–inorganic heterojunction structures.23–25
In this study, we demonstrate an organic–inorganic hybrid photo-conductive UV detector with a dramatic enhancement of dark-resistivity due to the depleting effect incorporated by TiO2 nanowires array (NWA)/N,N′-bis-(1-naphthalenyl)-N,N′-bis-phenyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (NPB) heterojunction. The high ordered TiO2 NWA was prepared, which possessed advantages such as enhanced photo-sensitivity and reduced dimensionality.26,27 NPB, a p-type wide band-gap material, has been widely applied in the organic light-emitting diode and solar cells as a hole extraction layer,28,29 but was first employed in UV detection. NPB was simply filled into TiO2 NWA gaps by a facile two-step method of static infusion and dynamic solution-cleaning. The role of the first step is filling the NPB into TiO2 NWA gaps, and the redundant NPB layer will be left. In the second step, the top NPB layer can quickly and conveniently be removed. In this study, the devices with and without top NPB layers were fabricated, and the latter was treated with more research emphasis, delivering the optimal performance. TiO2/NPB device without top NPB layer has greatly decreased Id and increased Il, attributed to the enhanced dark-resistivity and photo-conductivity. In the dark, the depletion region generated by the difference of work function (WF) between TiO2 NWA and NPB is responsible for the depletion of majority carriers in both the materials, limiting the carrier density in the device. This contributes to the lower Id. Under UV illumination, the photo-generated carriers are produced in both TiO2 NWA and NPB. Thus, the depleting effect is offset by the dissociation and accumulation of photo-generated carriers, resulting in the enhancement of carrier density and photo-conductivity. The TiO2/NPB device with top NPB layer exhibits some photo-voltaic properties and demonstrates insufficient photo-response, although its Id is low. The detailed preparation and working mechanism of TiO2 NWA device and TiO2/NPB composite devices have been discussed in the following study.
Experimental details
Preparation of samples
The fabrication processes of devices are shown in Fig. 1, including the preparation of TiO2 NWA (Fig. 1a), static infusion of NPB solution (Fig. 1b), dynamic cleaning of the excessive NPB (Fig. 1c), and sputtering of the Au electrode. First, TiO2 NWA was prepared on the surface of FTO substrate by polar directional hydrothermal method (Fig. 1a). Precursor solution was prepared by slowly dropping 0.4 mL tetrabutyl titanate, 0.1 mL titanium tetrachloride and 0.5 mL acetic acid into 12 mL toluene solvent sequentially, vigorously stirring for 15 min. The pre-cleaned and UV-ozone treated FTO glass substrate was put into a 20 mL reactor, in which the prepared precursor solution was poured, reacting at 150 °C for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the FTO substrate was taken out and cleaned with ethanol and deionized water successively, followed by natural drying. Then, NPB was filled into TiO2 NWA gaps by static infusion method. The entire surface of TiO2 NWA was dipped into a 5 mg mL−1 NPB tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution, statically placing for 45 s and subsequently spin-coated at a low speed of 800 rpm. This was kept for another 5 min in order to allow the air to completely release the remaining THF. NPB existed in both gaps and on the top of TiO2 NWA. Thus, excess NPB on the surface was removed by dynamic solution-cleaning method. Moreover, 500 μL THF was slowly dropped onto the rotating substrate at a high speed of 6000 rpm. Furthermore, THF formed a high speed rotating cleaning-plane to just remove the redundant NPB on the top of TiO2, protecting the NPB filled in the NWA. Finally, Au electrode was fabricated by magnetron sputtering technology as the anode, and the effective area of the electrode was 0.04 cm2. Herein, TiO2 NWA device and TiO2/NPB devices with and without top NPB layer have been named as Device A, B, and C, respectively.

Characterization
The surface and cross morphology were analyzed using a JEOL JSM-7500 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku D/MAX 2550 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer. The absorption spectra were measured by a Shimadzu UV-1700 Pharma Spec UV spectrophotometer. The energy levels were investigated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) with HeI excitation. A 30 W deuterium lamp was used as the light source, and monochromatic light was provided by a monochromator. The current–voltage (I–V) measurements were carried out using a Keithley 2601 source meter. The time response characteristics were obtained using an oscilloscope.
Results and discussion
TiO2 NWA was fabricated onto the FTO substrate by hydrothermal method via the following process: first, the dense TiO2 layer was generated on FTO, and TiO2 was continued to grow and bifurcate into luxuriant NWA structures, as shown in Fig. 2a-i. Fig. 2a-ii and 2a-iii are surface and cross-section SEM images of pure TiO2 NWA. The surface SEM image suggests that the NWA is uniformly distributed and almost independent with a diameter of ca. 30 nm, and a large gap between adjacent NW was found to exist. The cross-section SEM image displays that the total thickness of TiO2 was ca. 2.14 μm, and the thickness of TiO2 dense layer, which was about 0.71 μm, accounted for one third of the total thickness. Moreover, the height of TiO2 NWA was ca. 1.43 μm. The crystal type of TiO2 was further measured with XRD and is shown in Fig. 3a, suggesting that all the diffraction peaks correspond to the pure rutile crystal (JCPDS Card no. 21-1276) without any redundant peaks. Fig. 2b shows TiO2 NWA covered by the top NPB layer, which unravels that NPB fills into array gaps and forms a layer on the top of TiO2. It can be seen from the surface SEM image (Fig. 2b-ii) that the top of TiO2 NWA cannot be distinguished after filling and coating by NPB. At the same time, the cross-section SEM image shows indistinct NWA structure, proving that NPB has been filled into the gaps of TiO2. The total thickness of TiO2/NPB composite was 2.36 μm. Thus, the roughly estimated thickness of top NPB was about 0.22 μm. In this study, the top NPB was of no use. Dynamic solution-cleaning method was carried out to effectively remove the top NPB layer, thus exposing the top of TiO2 NWA. The schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 2c-i. The surface and cross-section SEM images demonstrate that the top NPB layer was fully cleaned out and the NPB into the TiO2 gaps was protected. Then, the total thickness of TiO2/NPB was restored to 2.14 μm.

XPS analysis was carried out to examine the existence and chemical state of Ti on the surface of samples. The results in Fig. 3b display the vanishing characteristic peaks of Ti from TiO2 NWA to TiO2/NPB composite with top NPB layer, suggesting that TiO2 NWA was completely covered. After treating by dynamic solution-cleaning, the characteristic peaks of Ti reappeared in the XPS spectrum of TiO2/NPB without the top NPB. A comparison of the observed spin-energy separation of ca. 5.8 eV between Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 peaks indicated a normal chemical state of Ti4+ in both pristine TiO2 NWA and TiO2/NPB without the top layer. A lower binding energy of Ti 2p for TiO2/NPB composite was found to have shifted by ca. 0.55 eV, which could possibly be due to the electron transfer from NPB to TiO2 in an excited state.30,31
The absorption spectrum of TiO2 NWA in the device is shown in Fig. 4, which indicates an excellent solar blinding property. TiO2 NWA could absorb UV light shorter than 400 nm, and had an absorption peak at the wavelength of ca. 330 nm. It was notable that the curves sharply dropped in the shorter wavelength region, which can be attributed to the strong light absorption of FTO and glass substrate, thereby blocking the light in this range to reach photo-sensitive layer. At this moment, the photo-sensitive range (300–400 nm) was determined and it contributed to lengthen the lifetime of devices due to the prevention of high energy irradiation for photo-sensitive materials. At the same time, the absorption edge of NPB was close to that of TiO2 NWA. Thus, their optical absorption band-gaps were similar, wherein ca. 3.02 eV was for TiO2 NWA and ca. 3.01 eV for NPB, approximately calculated using the Planck's equation: Eg = 1240/λ where, Eg is the optical absorption band-gap energy and λ is the absorption edge.32 The absorption spectrum of TiO2/NPB composite displays increased light absorption compared to pure TiO2 NWA, which can be ascribed to the light absorption of NPB.

The I–V characteristics were the most fundamental performances of UV detectors and obtaining high Il and low Id were the research objectives. Fig. 5a has displayed dark I–V characteristics of different devices. Apparently, Device A has shown higher Id, while it is the lowest for Device B at each bias. It is known that Id of one-dimensional material based devices consists of extrinsic majority carrier current produced by the semiconductor itself and hot carrier current injected from electrodes under applied bias. For Device A, the dark I–V curve was not symmetrical about the Y axis, and Id at the positive bias was larger than that at the negative bias (0.75 μA at the bias of 6 V while 0.17 μA at the bias of −6 V), which can be attributed to different WF of electrodes on both sides of TiO2 (4.7 eV for FTO, lower than 5.1 eV for Au). Therefore, different Schottky barriers have to be jumped at the process of electrons injection under applied bias.33 It can be concluded that hot carrier injection current occupies the dominant position for the Id of Device A. The Id inevitably suffers from the effect of TiO2 NWA and the Schottky barrier with different height formed by various electrodes contact.34 At the bias of 6 V, Device B and C display much lower Id (0.034 and 0.11 μA) than Device A, which is ascribed to the limitation effect on the hot carrier transport. For Device B, the top of TiO2 NWA was not in contact with the Au anode. As a result, the high conduction band of NPB could effectively block the electron transport, leading to an increased electron barrier for the injected hot electron transmission and limited hot electron current. For Device C, TiO2 NWA was in direct contact with Au anode due to cleaned NPB layer on the top of TiO2 NWA, thus eliminating the blocking effect of high electron barrier from NPB on the hot electron transport. However, TiO2 NWA was surrounded by NPB in NWA gaps, and n-type TiO2 and p-type NPB formed a pn heterojunction and produced a depleting effect, resulting in depleted majority carriers in both TiO2 and NPB. As a result, TiO2 was found to play the role of electron traps to limit the hot electron transport, enhance dark-resistivity, and benefit for the decreased hot electron current, which was also found to be existing in Device B. It was noteworthy that the dense TiO2 layer was found to block the contact of NPB and FTO, thereby avoiding the hole current flow from NPB to cathode in devices. It was also found that the Id of Device C was higher than Device B, mainly due to the stronger limitation effect on the hot electron current of Device B by the high barrier from top NPB layer. It can be concluded that pn photovoltaic device (Device B) demonstrates an evident advantage to limit Id, but exhibits unsatisfactory photo-response. As observed in Fig. 5b, the Il of Device B was about two orders of magnitude lower than Device A and C because of a high carrier transport barrier for photovoltaic devices; it was difficult to form large gain and high responsivity.35 Moreover, the light I–V curve of Device B does not pass through the origin, which is a character of photovoltaic devices.36 The reason for higher Il of the Device A and Device C (photo-conductive devices) was TiO2 NWA with high photo-conductivity facilitated electrons to inject to cathode under illumination and generate an electron gain. For Device C, the photo-generated carriers simultaneously appeared in both TiO2 and NPB under UV illumination. Therefore, pn heterojunction depleting effect was offset with the dissociation and accumulation of photo-generated carriers. Moreover, TiO2 NWA could conduct electrons and provide gain instead of acting as electron traps. Because of the participation of NPB in the process of photoelectric conversion, the Il of Device C was higher than that of Device A. Finally, Device C achieved the Il to Id ratio of 1.67 × 104, which was much higher than Device A (1.06 × 103) and B (2.09 × 103).

In order to investigate the operating mechanism of Device C in dark and under UV illumination, the energy levels diagrams were employed to analyze the internal carrier generation and transport. The energy levels of TiO2 NWA and NPB were first obtained by UPS measurements. Fig. 6a depicts UPS spectra in view of high binding energy region, which indicates WF of TiO2 (4.69(±0.01) eV) and NPB (5.15(±0.01) eV). The valence-band maximum (VBM) of TiO2 was 2.71(±0.02) eV under its Fermi level and 0.35(±0.01) eV for NPB, obtained by the UPS spectra in view of low binding energy region in Fig. 6b. The difference of WF can introduce Ebi with direction from TiO2 to NPB and simultaneously give rise to depletion region, which acts as the majority carrier trap.37 Therefore, the depleting effect will reduce the electron density and enhance dark-resistivity in TiO2, as shown in the energy levels diagram of TiO2/NPB heterojunction in dark (Fig. 6c). When the optimized device is under UV illumination, the TiO2/NPB composite will simultaneously produce photo-generated carriers due to their almost similar optical absorption band-gaps. Driven by Ebi, the drift motion of photo-generated carriers was promoted, viz. photo-generated holes in TiO2 was found to flow to NPB while photo-generated electrons in NPB travelled to TiO2. With the dissociation and accumulation of photo-generated carriers, Ebi was reduced until completely offset.38 This moment, the electron transfer in TiO2 NWA would not be restricted by depletion region, ensuring electron gain and Il of device.

The generation and dissociation of photo-generated carriers are the major factors to offset depleting effect and ensure high responsivity of device based on the TiO2/NPB heterojunction. In order to verify the dissociation of photo-generated carriers at the interface of TiO2 and NPB under UV illumination, photoluminescence (PL) and transient PL decay spectra were examined, which are convenient tools to investigate the intermolecular charge transfer or energy transfer processes.39,40 In Fig. 7a, the NPB film (∼120 nm in thickness spin-coated on FTO substrate) shows strong PL emission peak at 440 nm under 330 nm light excitation. However, TiO2 NWA has almost no PL emission. Compared to NPB film, PL emission of TiO2/NPB composite is markedly quenched, indicating efficient exciton dissociation at TiO2/NPB interface or energy transfer from NPB to TiO2. However, the distribution of NPB in two samples of the NPB film and NPB/TiO2 composite was different without excluding the influence on emission intensity. Moreover, transient PL decay spectra were measured to further prove the presence of electron transfer from NPB to TiO2. It can be found from Fig. 7b that the decay time was decreased from 2.74 to 2.22 ns, suggesting that the recombination probability of charge carrier became lower and photo-generated excitons were effectively dissociated compared to single-material, providing sufficient evidence for the existence of photo-generated carrier transfer in TiO2/NPB heterojunction under UV illumination.

To explore the photo-response characteristics of devices, the responsivity (R) at each wavelength were calculated using the following formula: (1)where Il(λ) is the measured Il of devices under 6 V bias at different wavelengths, P(λ) is the corresponding incident light intensity, and A is the effective area of device. The photo-response curves from 250 to 500 nm are shown in Fig. 8. It can be found that the real response region was located in 290–400 nm, and the peaks of R appeared at the wavelength of 330 nm. Device C displays the highest R of 1021 A W−1, and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) can be attained using the following formula: EQE = R × hν, and EQE was found to reach up to 3.8 × 103, providing sufficient light gain. The specific detectivity (D*) reflects the ability to detect weak signals from the noise environment. Considering that the shot noise from Id is the major factor for limiting the detectivity, the D* can be expressed as6,41 (2)where e is the electronic charge. Because of the enhanced R and suppressed Id, the D* of Device C was 1.09 × 1015 Jones at the wavelength of 330 nm. Under the same condition, Device B displays inadequate R of 39.2 A W−1 and D* of 7.54 × 1013 Jones. The R of all devices dramatically decreased in the short wavelength region (less than 300 nm) due to strong light absorption of FTO glass substrate, which was in accordance to the absorption spectra. At the range of 330–400 nm, the decreased light absorption of photo-sensitive material can lead to the reduced R. At the wavelength exceeding 400 nm, the working states of all devices were approximately dark without light absorption, presenting a good solar-blinding property. Therefore, R was decided by Id, which showed similar distribution with dark I–V curves.

The time response characteristics including the raise time (τr) and decay time (τd) measured under 330 nm light with intensity of 30 μW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 9a, which are the crucial factors to demonstrate device performance. The τr (from 10% to 90% of the top value) of Device A, B and C are 20.9, 24.9 and 25.8 ms, respectively. Device B and C demonstrate longer τr because photo-generated carriers have to be accumulated to offset the depletion region before achieving the saturation state of device response. This led to slower response speed. Among them, the τr of Device C was slightly longer than that of Device B because it could realize higher photo-response. In contrast, the τd (from 90% to 10% of the top value) of Device B and C was shorter than that of Device A, which was 9.5 ms for Device B and 11.1 ms for Device C compared with 15.2 ms for Device A. The shorter τd mainly can be attributed to the recovery of depleting effect and accelerated carrier recombination on converting from UV on to off. The τr and τd of Device A and C were also measured under different light intensities and are shown in Fig. 9b. The τr and τd of Device A demonstrated an approximately linear trend. Because electron diffusion in single TiO2 is determined by trapping/detrapping events, the time response usually depends on light intensity.42 For Device C, τr and τd were proportional to light intensity in relatively higher light intensity range (higher than ca. 4.5 μW cm−2), while they deviate from the linear relationship in a low light intensity range (lower than ca. 4.5 μW cm−2). Similar results were found in a previous report about heterojunction devices.21 Therefore, it can be concluded that the depletion region is exactly offset at the critical light intensity (ca. 4.5 μW cm−2). When the light intensity was higher than the critical value, the response and recovery of Device C accompanied the complete offset and reconstruction of the depletion region. Hence, τr and τd of Device C displayed a linear relationship with light intensity. When the light intensity was lower than the critical value, the response of Device C no longer followed the previous linear relationship, but relatively accelerated, because depleting effect cannot be completely eliminated, spending less time than that through offset of depletion region. The inset of Fig. 9b is the Il characteristics of Device A and C versus light intensity, which further verified the discussion on critical light intensity. The Il of Device A always shows a linear relationship with light intensity, while Device C exhibits two linear regions on both sides of ca. 4.5 μW cm−2. This was because the depletion region is completely offset within the higher light intensity, while it still exists under the lower light intensity. Fig. 9c depicts multi cycle test results of Device C, demonstrating good stability and repeatability of the device. Moreover, performance comparisons were carried out around TiO2 based heterostructure UV detectors, which are summarized in Table 1. It can be found that this TiO2/NPB device was competitive in all aspects of performances.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the improved performance of photo-conductive UV detector by distributing NPB only into TiO2 NWA gaps and removing the top NPB layer with dynamic solution-cleaning. Due to the WF difference between n-type TiO2 and p-type NPB, the depletion region was formed near contact interfaces and effectively depleted majority carriers, which contributed to increased dark-resistivity. Under illumination, the depletion region was wiped out by dissociation and accumulation of photo-generated carriers. Moreover, the increased carrier density was found to improve the device photo-conductivity, which enhanced Il. Compared to TiO2 NWA device, TiO2/NPB device without the top NPB layer shows superior performance both in dark and under UV illumination. Compared to TiO2/NPB photo-voltaic device with top NPB layer, it was weaker to limit Id but could provide sufficient photo-response, thereby leading to higher Il to Id ratio. These findings offer a great promise of an easily prepared organic–inorganic hybrid heterojunction UV detector.
