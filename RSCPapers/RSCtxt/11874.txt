    , Accepted 1st September 2017First published on 1st September 2017AbstractThe global dependence on exhaustible fossil fuel resources has made the search for an alternative renewable and sustainable fuel more urgent. Photocatalysis has gained increasing consideration as a promising technology to solve problems associated with solar energy conversion. Fabricated m-BiVO4-based heterostructures have shown improved photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution and pollutant degradation; however, a deeper understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism and the role of the monolayers is still lacking. Moreover, no theoretical studies have been carried out on MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures. In the present study, the roles of MoS2 and WS2 monolayers loaded onto a m-BiVO4 surface for active photocatalytic hydrogen production and pollutant degradation are explored using first-principle studies. Herein, hybrid density functional calculations and a long-range dispersion correction method were used to investigate the charge transfer, electronic properties, photocatalytic activity and mechanism of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures. The results showed a narrow band gap, built-in potential and a type-II band alignment for the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures compared to pure m-BiVO4, which favour the separation and transfer of charge carriers and visible-light-driven activity. The MoS2/m-BiVO4 heterostructure showed a suitable band edge for hydrogen production and pollutant degradation compared to the WS2/m-BiVO4 heterostructure. This improvement was attributed to the role of the MoS2 monolayer as an electron donor, the many reactive sites on the MoS2 surface and the enhanced electron/hole pair separation of charge carriers at the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) interface. Considering that the MS2 monolayer coupled with m-BiVO4 can restrain the electron–hole recombination rate without lattice distortion indicates that the heterostructure approach is better than the doping approach. Based on the analysis of the electronic properties, the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures were shown to fit within the acceptable band gap and built-in potential range. The proposed theoretical design paves a way for the effective and large-scale fabrication of m-BiVO4-based photocatalyst for solar energy conversion and environmental remediation applications.
1. Introduction
The two most significant problems faced by most developing countries is the supply of sustainable energy and environmental protection. Most countries depend on low-efficient power generation from burning fossil fuels as their source of energy.1 The burning of fossil fuels typically generates a huge amount of CO2, which induces environmental concerns, such as the greenhouse effect.2 Moreover, nitrogen and sulphur impurities in fossil fuels are converted into NOx and SOx gases during combustion, which when released into the atmosphere can affect human health. As a non-renewable natural resource, fossil fuels cannot be sustainable and will likely be depleted shortly in the next century owing to their high consumption rate or phased out due to environmental concerns.3 This has led to the investigation of photocatalysis as a possible solution to replacing fossil fuels. To date, semiconductor-based photocatalyst materials have received much consideration in environmental remediation owing to their high-efficiency in mineralising and degrading contaminants in water systems,4–6 as well as in applications for splitting water into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) gas.7,8 The photocatalyst technology behind fuel cells with high-energy conversion efficiency has attracted much attention due to the low pollution during the process of energy generation.9 Producing hydrogen by water splitting can help meet the increasing global energy demand, as well as help reduce the release of greenhouse gases and the subsequent environmental damage that may be caused.10
Owing to its low-cost, narrow band gap and exceptional chemical stability, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is one of the most promising photocatalyst materials for contaminant degradation and water splitting under simulated visible light irradiation.11 BiVO4 exists in three (3) polymorphs: tetragonal scheelite, tetragonal zircon and monoclinic scheelite.11 Since monoclinic BiVO4 (m-BiVO4) has a smaller band gap (2.4 eV) compared to the other forms, it shows a better photodegradation performance towards organic pollutants, as well as water splitting for oxygen and hydrogen evolution.12 The visible light activity of m-BiVO4 is due to the electron excitation from the Bi 6s and O 2p states in the valence band (VB) to the V 3d state in the conduction band (CB) of VO43−. Nonetheless, the photocatalytic activity of bulk m-BiVO4 remains restricted in the visible light region owing to its poor adsorptive activity and fast recombination rate of charge carriers.13 Moreover, BiVO4 is barely used in water splitting to generate hydrogen owing to its lower CB edge compared to the H+/H2 reduction potential (about 0 eV) vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).14
Previously, considerable efforts were made to enhance the photocatalytic performance of pure BiVO4, including by heterogeneous structure composites, co-catalysts incorporation, and impurity doping.15 Doping16–18 or co-doping19,20 with intrinsic impurity atom(s) has been shown to be an effective approach to reduce the band gap energy, which can result in an easier electron migration from the valence band to the conduction band during the photocatalytic process to improve water splitting and the degradation of pollutants. The introduced acceptor/donor state can make the band positions suitable to improve the optical absorption. However, studies have shown that the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers in doped systems is slow owing to the partially occupied impurity states, which serve as recombination centres and reduce the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers to suppress their mobility.21 Thus, the dopant-mediated fast recombination of charge carriers is a major issue limiting practical application.22
Since the most important step in photocatalysis involves an efficient separation and excitation of charges to the semiconductor surface,23 the photocatalytic activity can be improved by suppressing the recombination of charge carriers. Combining m-BiVO4 with another semiconductor having a suitable band potential to form heterostructures is an effective technique to enhance the separation of charge carriers.24 Therefore, heterostructured photocatalyst materials can integrate multiple functionalities by incorporating the different features of the individual semiconductors within the heterostructures,25 which can restrain the recombination rate to enhance the separation of charge carriers.26 Several BiVO4-based heterostructured photocatalysts such as Bi2O3/BiVO4,27 CuO/BiVO4,28 BiVO4/TiO2,29 CeOx/BiVO4,30 and WO3/BiVO431 have been designed. These heterostructures have shown improved photocatalytic activity compared to pure BiVO4. Basically, the enhancement may correlate to the charge transfer at the interface. Theoretically, suitable heterostructures can significantly enhance the charge transfer at the interface, which consequently efficiently reduces the recombination of charge carriers and greatly improves the photocatalytic activity. Therefore, choosing a suitable semiconductor material to match the energy bands of m-BiVO4 is key to designing efficient m-BiVO4-based photocatalyst heterostructures.
Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as phosphorene,32 hexagonal boron nitride33 and transition metal dichalcogenides,34 have been established as next generation photocatalyst materials due to their excellent carrier mobility, specific surface area, good stability and controllable interfaces.35,36 Through first-principles studies, some 2D materials have been shown to be promising photocatalysts.37,38 Monolayer metal disulphides, MX2 (M = Mo and W; X = S, Se and Te) show high promise in photocatalysis due to their excellent activity and large surface area.39 Among these, MoS2 and WS2 monolayers have received much interest due to their high charge carrier mobility.40 The immobilisation of MS2 (M = Mo and W) monolayers on the m-BiVO4 surface may improve the electron transfer and the photocatalytic performance. Currently, the key factor that obstructs the widespread use of these materials is the influence of the van der Waals (vdWs) interactions, which can lead to the aggregation of these 2D materials, which can subsequently reduce the surface area and decrease the number of active sites.41 To address these issues, designing photocatalysts with more active sites would be a useful approach to enhance the photoactivity. The most common approach to increase the active sites is to enhance the structural characteristics. The weak interlayer interaction in the MoS2 and WS2 monolayers determines the electronic and structural properties. Although fabricated MoS2/m-BiVO4 heterostructures42,43 have shown improved photocatalytic activity for pollutant degradation and hydrogen production, a deeper understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism and the role of the monolayers is still lacking. Moreover, there are no theoretical reports on MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures. In particular, the intrinsic relationships among the geometrical structure, the electronic structure and the photocatalytic activity of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) vdWs heterostructures are still not clear. Without a fundamental understanding of the electronic band structures, it is difficult to firmly fabricate heterostructures to enhance the photocatalytic performance. Therefore, herein, we study the band alignment, electronic structure and photocatalytic activity of MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures using the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) and long-range dispersion correction methods. We also performed a comparative investigation of the heterostructures to gain in-depth knowledge of the distribution of charge carriers in the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures. For these novel materials to be applied in photocatalysis, a comprehensive understanding of the role played by the MoS2 and WS2 modifiers should be obtained, for which density functional theory (DFT) calculations are beneficial and were utilised here for predicting novel heterostructures.
2. Computational detail
The structural models of bulk m-BiVO4, MoS2 and WS2 were built using the Material Studio 2016 graphical user interface. The basic structural unit of bulk m-BiVO4 (Fig. 1a) was modelled with BiO8 dodecahedrons and VO4 tetrahedrons.44
 Fig. 1  The optimised structures of: (a) m-BiVO4, (b) MoS2 and (c) WS2. 
The BiO8 dodecahedral forms chains with the edges, while each VO4 tetrahedron is linked to a BiO8 dodecahedron by sharing an oxygen atom at the apex. In the monolayer WS2 and MoS2, a plane of W (or Mo) atoms is covalently connected by two S atoms in a trigonal prismatic arrangement (Fig. 1b and c).45 The interactions between the MS2 monolayer are controlled by long-range vdWs interactions. The primitive vectors of the MS2 monolayer are  = (a, 0, 0),  and  = (0, 0, c)46 with a space group and point group of Pm1 and D6h, respectively. Before exploring the properties of MS2/m-BiVO4 heterostructures (M = Mo, W), the structural properties of the MS2 and m-BiVO4 monolayers were investigated. In this study, the MS2 monolayer as a photosensitizer was chosen since it has an ideal band gap for solar energy conversion.47 The [010] surface of m-BiVO4 was cleaved from the optimised structure (Fig. 1) with atomic layers separated by a 20 Å vacuum space to model the slab surface. The BiVO4(010) surface was the most stable surface compared to the other low index surfaces of BiVO4.48 In order to simulate MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, a 8 × 4 supercell of MS2 was used to match a 5 × 2 supercell of m-BiVO4. The constructed supercell (25.735 × 12.642 × 40.441 Å3 and 25.735 × 12.613 × 40.412 Å3 for the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) and WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, respectively) had a 20 Å vacuum space along the Z direction to prevent the periodic interactions between the neighbouring slabs. The optimised structures of MS2/m-BiVO4(010) are shown in Fig. 2.

All the DFT calculations were performed using the plane-wave approach of the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package code49 in Materials Studio 2016.50 The interactions between the ion cores and the valence electrons were treated using the norm-conserving pseudopotential.51 The generalised gradient approximation in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functionals52 was used to prevent the exchange–correlation effects. To obtain accurate electronic structures (band structures, optical properties, and density of states) of MS2, m-BiVO4 and the heterostructure systems, a hybrid functional of Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof53 was used. In the hybrid HSE06 functional, the exchange contributions are grouped into short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) parts of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange with a 25% Hartree–Fock exchange. The first Brillouin zone integrations were performed using 14 × 14 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack54k-point samplings for the geometry calculations. In the supercell calculations of the heterostructures, dipole corrections55 were used to prevent spurious interactions between the periodic images of the slab. The minimisation algorithm was carried out by the conjugate gradient approach of the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno scheme.56 The cut-off energy was set at 550 eV. All the geometrical structures were fully relaxed until the convergence criteria of the force and energy tolerance were less than 0.01 eV Å−1 and 10−6 eV, respectively, with a self-consistent convergence accuracy of 10−6 eV per atom. Due to the presence of weak bonding interactions between MS2 and m-BiVO4, the vdWs dispersion method of Grimme57 was adopted. Since strong light absorption is one of the fundamental features of semiconductor photocatalysts, the absorption spectrum of MS2/m-BiVO4(010) vdWs heterostructures was evaluated using the frequency-dependent dielectric function.58
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural stability
In our simulations, the most stable geometries of MS2/m-BiVO4(010) vdWs heterostructures were found by optimising the different initial structures, and the surface lattices were also optimised during the structural relaxation process. For all the systems, the m-BiVO4(010) slab and MS2 sheets had almost similar geometries after relaxation. The MS2 monolayer retained the flat-like structure of graphene without large distortions. Table 1 shows a comparison between the calculated lattice constants and bond lengths of m-BiVO4, MoS2 and WS2 with those of earlier studies.

For the bulk m-BiVO4 structure, the calculated lattice constant agreed considerably well with the experimental value.59 The optimised lattice parameter of MoS2 was consistent with earlier reports.61 The bond length of Bi–O (2.42 Å) compared well with other theoretical studies.44 For the relaxed MoS2 monolayer, the bond lengths of S–S (3.13 Å) and bond angle of S–Mo–S (80.70°) agreed well with those of other theoretical studies.64 In the relaxed structure of the WS2 monolayer, the bond length of the adjacent S atoms (3.15 Å) agreed well with previous experimental data.65 The bond length of W–S was consistent with earlier studies.63 The S–W–S angle (80.99°) was also in close agreement with earlier theoretical studies.62 These results provided authentication of our calculation methods and the calculated results.
The interactions between the MS2 monolayer and m-BiVO4(010) surface are essential factors for the photocatalytic performance and stability of the heterostructures. To check the interactions in the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, the interface adhesion energy was calculated using eqn (1):58 E(ad) = (E(MS2/BiVO4(010)) − E(MS2) − E(BiVO4(010)))/surface area,(1)where E(MS2/BiVO4(010)), E(MS2) and E(BiVO4(010)) are the total energies of the relaxed MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, the MS2 monolayer and the m-BiVO4(010) surface, respectively. The calculated adhesion energies were −0.49 and −0.51 eV Å−2 for the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) and WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, respectively. These negative adhesion energies indicated a stable interface and strong interfacial interaction. The MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure with a lower adhesion energy is formed more easily than the WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure.
To analyse the relative stability of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, the binding energy between the stacking monolayers in the heterostructures was calculated using eqn (2):66 Eb = ([E(MS2) + E(BiVO4(010))] − E(MS2/BiVO4(010))),(2)where Eb is the binding energy per sulphur atom. Binding energies of 18.23 and 24.37 meV per sulphur atom were calculated for the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) and WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, respectively. These values are within the range of typical vdWs binding energies.67 Interfacial interaction in the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures were further evaluated by the equilibrium distance between the constituents. After geometric optimisation, the equilibrium distance between the top-most atom of the m-BiVO4(010) surface and the bottom-most atom of MoS2 (WS2) was measured as 3.04 (3.11) Å. This showed that the interactions between the MS2 monolayer and m-BiVO4(010) surface were indeed vdWs and not covalent. These equilibrium distances were larger than those observed in the graphene/BiVO4 heterostructure (2.99 Å)68 and almost equal to other MoS2-based heterostructures (3.32 Å MoS2/GR;69 3.04 Å MoS2/C6070). The smaller equilibrium distance of the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure shows that the interaction between the MoS2 monolayer and m-BiVO4(010) surface was stronger compared to the equilibrium distance between the WS2 monolayer and m-BiVO4(010) surface. Both the binding energy and the equilibrium distance showed typical van der Waals interactions for the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures.
To analyse the effect of the surface state on the MS2(001) and m-BiVO4(010) surfaces, the surface energy was examined using eqn (3):71 (3)where Ebulk and Eslab are the total energy of the bulk units and total energy of the slab, respectively, and A is the area of the slab. The calculated surface energies of the MoS2(001), WS2(001) and m-BiVO4(010) surfaces were 0.25, 0.22 and 0.50 J m−2, respectively. The order of increasing stability was WS2(001) < MoS2(001) < m-BiVO4(010). The calculated value of the m-BiVO4(010) surface was higher than the previously calculated result of the m-BiVO4(010) surface with n number of unit cells (0.02–0.03 J m−2).72 The smaller surface energies indicate that the MoS2(001), WS2(001) and m-BiVO4(010) surfaces are easier to form. Usually, a large surface energy indicates a higher photocatalytic performance.73–75 This result shows that the MoS2(001) slab was more active with reference to the WS2(001) slab, and could provide a higher photocatalytic performance for pollutant degradation and water splitting.
3.2 Electronic structure
To understand the influence of MS2 hybridization on the electronic band structure of m-BiVO4, the band structure of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures was calculated using the hybrid HSE06 functional. For comparison, the energy bands of the MoS2, WS2, m-BiVO4, MoS2(001), WS2(001) and m-BiVO4(010) surfaces were also calculated, as given in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Calculated band structures of: (a) m-BiVO4, (b) MoS2, (c) WS2, (d) m-BiVO4(010), (e) MoS2(001), (f) WS2(001), (g) MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) and (h) WS2/m-BiVO4(010) within the hybrid HSE06 functional. The Fermi level was set to zero as a dashed horizontal black line. 
Although the absolute calculated band gaps of 2.32, 1.44 and 1.81 eV for the m-BiVO4, MoS2, and WS2, respectively, were underestimated using the GGA functional due to its shortcomings to account for strongly correlated electron systems with localised d and f electrons,76 the band gap (2.42 eV) estimated by the hybrid HSE06 for bulk m-BiVO4 was consistent with the previous experimental value (2.40 eV)77 and the theoretical result.78 The optimised structure possessed an indirect band gap (Fig. 3a), which agreed well with the experimental result79 and other theoretical studies.80 In addition, our observed band gap was higher than that reported by Wang et al.81 Moreover, the direct band gap of m-BiVO4(010) surface was 2.24 eV, as given in Fig. 3d. This direct band gap favours optical transition without any significant changes in the wave vector, which can improve the visible light response of m-BiVO4(010) surface.44 Hence, the narrow direct band gap can influence the visible light optical absorption of the m-BiVO4(010) surface, as revealed by Zhao et al.78 However, there is an association between the mobility and the effective mass of charge carriers. Theoretically, the mobility of electron–hole pairs can be qualitatively evaluated using the effective mass of electron–hole pairs.82 A flatter electronic band structure will result in localised charge carriers.83 Therefore, the localised states in the valence band maximum (VBM) of m-BiVO4(010) (Fig. 3d) are not suitable for the photocatalytic activity since a higher effective mass indicates a lower charge carrier mobility. In this study, our aim was to control and regulate the localised states via electronic band structure engineering. The MoS2 monolayer is a direct band gap (1.92 eV) semiconductor with both the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum (CBM) located on the H point, as shown in Fig. 3b. This agrees well with the experimental results (1.90 eV).84 The direct band gap (2.01 eV) of the WS2 monolayer also agreed well with the experimental band gap (2.05) of the WS2 monolayer (Fig. 3c).85 Because the band gap energy of the MS2 monolayer is ∼2.0 eV, the MS2 monolayer is suitable for visible light optical absorption. As a result of the introduced artefacts in the band structure by the supercells, the Brillouin zones of the individual components were folded leading to artificially folded bands in the electronic band structure.86 The MoS2 and WS2 slabs in their unfolded states had Eg values of 1.64 and 1.68 eV, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†). The formation of vdW heterostructures introduces strains in the layers compared with the individual components, and the 8 × 4 supercells of MoS2(001) and WS2(001) slabs are consequently increased by 1.76% and 1.98%, respectively, to match with the 4 × 2 supercell of the m-BiVO4(010) slab. This elongation increases the band gap of the MoS2(001) and WS2(001) slabs to 1.97 and 2.15 eV, respectively (Fig. 3e and f). For the MoS2(001) and WS2(001) monolayers, both the CBM and VBM were situated at the H point, resulting in a direct band gap semiconductor.
Due to the introduced strains and the interaction of the MoS2(001) and WS2(001) monolayers with the m-BiVO4(010) surface, the band gaps of the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) and WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures were narrowed to 2.15 and 2.23 eV, respectively (Fig. 3g and h). The band gaps of the heterostructures were thus in the typical band gap range for photocatalytic materials compared to the unfolded systems with Eg values of 1.78 and 1.87 eV (Fig. S1, ESI†) for the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) and WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, respectively.
In the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure, the VBM and CBM were found at one point within the G and F points, as given in Fig. 3g and h. Thus, the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures had indirect band gaps. The photoexcited electrons and holes of an indirect gap semiconductor undergo a change in their momentum state before recombination due to the occurrence of phonon emission. Thus, the recombination of the photoexcited charge carriers in the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures was partly restrained owing to their indirect band gap. The hybridization of the MS2 monolayers makes the VBM and CBM less flat than those of the m-BiVO4(010) surface owing to the rather curving bands, as given in Fig. 3g and h. This ensures a lower effective mass and a higher photoinduced charge carrier mobility.83 The MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures showed strongly delocalized VBM and CBM states. This strongly delocalized nature of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures provides a better mobility of the photoinduced charge carriers. In this study, the direct band gaps of m-BiVO4 turned into indirect band gaps in the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure. The band gap narrowing and transition were due to the interface strain caused by the MoS2 monolayer. This agrees well with other theoretical studies.47 This band gap transition indicates a significant wave function overlap to transfer the photogenerated electron from the MoS2 monolayer to the m-BiVO4(010) surface.87,88 Besides charge transfer, the enhanced charge separation also plays an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity. The built-in potential, which is the energy difference between the conduction band minimum of m-BiVO4 and MS2 was 0.48 and 0.43 eV for the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) and WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, respectively. Moreover, the large built-in potential in the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure means it can easily transfer the charge carriers, resulting in an effective separation. To achieve high photocatalytic activity, the desirable heterostructures must comprise a photosensitizer with a built-in potential range of 0.3–0.5 eV and a band gap of about 2.0 eV.89 Based on these conditions, the proposed MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure is considered an efficient approach to design m-BiVO4-based heterostructures with visible-light-driven photoactivity. In this study, we realised band gap control for efficient visible light absorption and a higher separation of charge carriers.
To exploit the influence of vdWs interactions on the electronic band structure of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, the partial density of states (PDOS) of the heterostructures, as well as for the individual MoS2, WS2, m-BiVO4, MoS2(001), WS2(001) and m-BiVO4(010) surfaces was plotted between −8 and 8 eV, as shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Calculated PDOS of: (a) m-BiVO4, (b) MoS2, (c) WS2, (d) m-BiVO4(010), (e) MoS2(001), (f) WS2(001), (g) MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) and (h) WS2/m-BiVO4(010). The vertical dashed line is the Fermi level. 
The Fermi level is pinned inside the VB states, signifying a p-type feature and upward band bending. For the bulk m-BiVO4 and m-BiVO4(010) surfaces, the VB is composed of V 3d, O 2p, and Bi 6s states to form V–O and Bi–O bonding states (Fig. 4a and d). The CB is composed of V 3d, O 2p and Bi 6s states to form V–O and Bi–O anti-bonding states. The VBM is mostly composed of the O 2p state, while the CBM consists of V 3d and O 2p states. The PDOS analysis of bulk m-BiVO4 and m-BiVO4(010) surface was consistent with other theoretical reports.78 Thus, the charge transfer can take place from the O 2p to V 3d states upon photoexcitation. The CBM and VBM of the MS2 monolayer mainly consist of Mo 4d (W 5d) and S 3p states (Fig. 4b and c). The contributions of the VBM and CBM along the MoS2(001) and WS2(001) slabs were the same as in their corresponding monolayers (Fig. 4e and f). The calculated PDOS results are consistent with other studies.90
For the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, the new VBM and CBM are largely contributed to by Mo 4d (W 5d) and V 3d states, respectively (Fig. 4g and h). From the calculated PDOS in Fig. 4, the VBM is mainly provided by the states from the MS2 monolayer, while the CBM is dominated by the states from the m-BiVO4 monolayer. Fig. 4 reveals that the m-BiVO4 and MS2 monolayers form a type-II band alignment with the CB edges of MS2 below and above the corresponding m-BiVO4 counterparts, hence forming a VB offset (VBO) and CB offset (CBO) between the MS2 monolayer and the m-BiVO4(010) surface. Thus, an electron can migrate from the VB to the CB of the MS2 monolayer, leaving behind holes in its valence band. Then, the photogenerated electron is excited into the conduction band of m-BiVO4, and the positively charged MS2 monolayer can remove the electron from the valence band of m-BiVO4, thereby transferring the photogenerated holes to the VB of m-BiVO4. Hence, the reduction and oxidation reactions can occur in the MS2 sheets and m-BiVO4, respectively. Since the MS2 monolayer acts as a photosensitizer in the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, the electrons and holes can easily generate and separate by electron diffusion from the MS2 to the m-BiVO4. Considering that the MS2 monolayer coupled with m-BiVO4 can restrain the electron–hole recombination rate without lattice distortion, this indicates that the heterostructures approach is better than the doping approach.
3.3 Work function
The work function is a crucial factor in investigating the band alignment and charge transfer at the interface of the heterostructures. The work function (Φ) is defined according to eqn (4):91 Φ = Evac − EF(4)where Evac and EF are the energies of an electron in vacuum near the surface and the Fermi level, respectively. The calculated work functions for the m-BiVO4, MoS2, WS2 and MS2/m-BiVO4(010) are given in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  The work functions: of (a) m-BiVO4(010), (b) MoS2(001), (c) WS2(001), (d) MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) and (e) WS2/m-BiVO4(010). The red and green dashed lines are the vacuum and Fermi level, respectively. 
The work functions of the unfolded Brillouin zones of the MoS2(001) and WS2(001) monolayers were 5.79 and 6.13 eV, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†). Moreover, the work functions of the m-BiVO4(010), MoS2(001), and WS2(001) slabs were also calculated for the folded Brillouin zones. The work function of the folded Brillouin zones was found to decrease compared to the unfolded system. The work functions for the m-BiVO4(010), MoS2(001), and WS2(001) slabs were estimated to be 5.79, 5.25 and 5.46 eV, respectively, for the folded Brillouin zones (Fig. 5a–c). The calculated work function of the m-BiVO4(010) surface agrees well with other theoretical studies.92 The calculated work function of MoS2(001) is comparable to that of earlier theoretical studies (5.20 eV)93 but higher than the experimental value of 4.04 eV.94 In this system, the electrons in the MS2 monolayer with a low work function will migrate into the m-BiVO4(010) surface with a high work function. This electron flow induces a potential energy at the interface and then the formation of a Schottky barrier. The built-in potential directed from the MS2 monolayer to the m-BiVO4(010) surface then occurs to stop the charge diffusion between the MS2 and m-BiVO4(010) surface. Therefore, the work function of the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) and WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures is reduced to 5.10 and 5.28 eV, respectively (Fig. 5d and e). Under simulated visible light irradiation, the separation and interfacial transfer of photoinduced charge carriers are influenced by the built-in potential.
As the MS2 monolayer comes in contact with the m-BiVO4(010) surface, the heterostructures become a joint electronic system. If there is no charge excitation between the MS2 monolayer and the m-BiVO4(010) surface, a small band bending can occur,95 which can be derived from eqn (5): ΔW = W − Wm-BiVO4,(5)where W and Wm-BiVO4 represent the work function of the heterostructures and the m-BiVO4(010) surface, respectively. The band bending was −0.69 and −0.51 eV for the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) and WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, respectively. Since ΔW > 0, electrons migrate from the MS2 monolayer to the m-BiVO4(010) surface.
3.4 Charge density differences
The Fermi level shift indicates a charge redistribution and interfacial interaction after the MS2 monolayer is coupled with the BiVO4(010) surface. To illustrate the interfacial charge transfer of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, the plane-averaged three-dimensional (3D) charge density difference ρ(z) along the Z direction was calculated, as given in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  3D Charge density differences of MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures with an isovalue of 0.006 e Å−3. Blue and green isosurfaces denote charge depletion and accumulation, respectively. 
A strong charge redistribution largely occurs in the interface region of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures. Moreover, charge redistribution can be realised in the m-BiVO4(010) slab and MS2 monolayer, which indicates a high amount of charge transfer between the MS2 sheet and the m-BiVO4(010) slab. The charge density difference indicated a high charge depletion on the MS2 surface, which results in hole-rich sites. However, a strong charge accumulation occurred on the m-BiVO4(010) surface, which thus formed electron-rich sites. Thus, holes accumulate in the MS2 surface, while electrons accumulate in the region close to the m-BiVO4(010) surface; therefore, electrons are expected to excite from the MS2 monolayer to the m-BiVO4(010) surface. Thus, in the photocatalytic process, the MS2 monolayer acts as an electron acceptor and conduction medium to transport electrons partaking in the oxidation–reduction reactions. Most importantly, Fig. 6 shows negatively charged Mo and W atoms in the MoS2 and WS2 monolayers. This signifies that the Mo and W atoms, which are catalytically inert at the basal planes, turn into active sites and are helpful to the photocatalytic activity of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures. Moreover, to quantify the amount of charge transfer between MS2 and the m-BiVO4(010) surface, Hirshfeld charge analysis was carried out for the charge densities of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures. The results showed that a total charge of −0.12 (−0.03) |e| was transferred from the MoS2 (WS2) monolayer to the m-BiVO4(010) surface. The larger amount of charge transferred in the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure was due to the smaller equilibrium distance (3.04 Å) between the MoS2 and m-BiVO4 monolayers. In the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) and WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, each Mo and W atom gained −0.32 (−0.16) |e| on average, while each S atom lost 0.50 (0.44) |e| on an average. The significant amount of charge transfer between the MoS2 monolayer and m-BiVO4(010) slab indicated strong donor–acceptor interactions. This means that the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures are an ideal material for hydrogen production and pollutant degradation compared to the WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure, due to the more suitable built-in potential and ideal charge redistribution at the interface.
3.5 Optical absorption
To check the photocatalytic activity of pure m-BiVO4 coupled with the MS2 monolayer, the optical absorption spectra of pure m-BiVO4, the m-BiVO4(010) surface, the MS2 monolayer and the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures were plotted, as shown in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Calculated absorption spectra of: MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, bulk m-BiVO4 and the m-BiVO4(010) surface. 
The absorption edge of pure m-BiVO4 being over a broader wavelength region (λ > 380 nm) indicates that m-BiVO4 is a visible light semiconductor photocatalyst. Compared to the pure m-BiVO4, the absorption edge is shifted to the broader wavelength region for the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures due to the coupled MoS2 and WS2 monolayers. Therefore, the hybridization between the m-BiVO4(010) surface and MS2 enhances the optical absorption edge and intensity of m-BiVO4 in the visible light region and hence contributes to the improved photocatalytic activity of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures.
3.6 Effective masses of the charge carriers
Apart from the visible light optical absorption properties, the charge carrier transport ability is also a significant factor for enhancing the photoactivity of photocatalyst materials.96 Furthermore, the separation and migration of charge carriers influence the quantum efficiency of photocatalytic reactions.97 Therefore, the charge carriers must transfer to the active sites, where they can undergo a photocatalytic reaction on the photocatalyst surface. Hence, a higher difference between the diffusion rates of the charge carriers signifies a reduced recombination rate.98 The mobility and transport rate of photogenerated charge carriers are calculated by their effective mass. The effective mass of electrons (me*) and holes (mh*) of m-BiVO4, MS2 and the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures were calculated according to eqn (6):99 (6)where m* and a are the effective mass of the charge carriers and the second-order coefficient term, . By definition, the mobility of photogenerated electron–hole pairs is inversely proportional to their effective mass.100 A smaller effective mass indicates a higher mobility and thus a faster transfer rate of charge carriers.101
The me* and mh* of pure m-BiVO4 and the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures at high-symmetry points are presented in Table 2.

The VBM of m-BiVO4(010) is flat around the A and B points as shown in Fig. 3d, which results in a large effective mass and a lower mobility of holes. The values for the effective mass of electrons in MoS2 and WS2 are small compared to that in m-BiVO4, signifying their more dispersive CBM structure. However, the values for the effective mass of electrons of m-BiVO4, MoS2 and WS2 are much higher compared to those of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, which signifies that the transfer of electrons in the m-BiVO4, MoS2 and WS2 is slower than that in the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures. The effective mass of electrons of the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure is smaller than that of the WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure, which indicates a faster carrier transfer during the photocatalytic process. The larger value of mh* in m-BiVO4 compared to that in MoS2 and WS2 indicates that the transfer efficiency of holes in the MoS2 and WS2 monolayers is extremely fast owing to the more dispersive electronic band structure at the VBM. However, the mh* values of the MoS2 and WS2 monolayers are higher than those in the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures. The effective mass of mh* along the WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure is much higher than that along the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure. This signifies that the diffusion of holes to the redox sites on the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure is faster, as deduced by the small effective mass, which results in a higher oxidation ability. The effective masses of electrons and holes along the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure are smaller compared to those in the WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure, which indicates a rapid charge carrier transfer rate. Thus, the mobility of photoinduced charge carriers in the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure is improved. This indicates that the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure can act as a photocatalyst material with light electrons and heavy holes. The heavy photogenerated holes and lighter electrons are helpful for separation of the photogenerated charge carriers and can further improve the photoactivity. Hence, it is reasonable to state that the improved visible light performance of the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure compared to the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure can be ascribed to the higher mobility and transfer rate of charge carriers in the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure.
The effective mass of photoinduced electrons is smaller compared to that of the holes. The large difference between the photoinduced electrons and holes is helpful to decrease their recombination rate.102 The relative ratio (D) of the effective mass of electrons and holes, which indicates the recombination rate is defined in eqn (7):99 (7)
In general, a higher D value designates a slower recombination rate and higher photocatalytic activity.99 The calculated D values are also presented in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, a greater difference between the D value and 1 shows a greater variance in the transfer rate of electron–hole pairs mobility, which indicates a reduced recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs for the semiconductor. Compared to m-BiVO4, MoS2 and WS2, the higher D value of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures indicates a lower recombination of charge carriers. Moreover, the D value in the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure is higher compared to the WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure, suggesting that the MoS2 modification results in a slower recombination of charge carriers. This shows that the photoexcited charge carriers in the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure are effectively separated with a longer lifetime of charge carriers. From this viewpoint, MoS2 modification is regarded as the most efficient approach to slow the recombination rate of photoinduced electron–hole pairs in m-BiVO4.
3.7 Possibilities for H2 production and pollutant degradation
Ideally, a band gap reduction in photocatalysis means a more efficient use of solar energy. Nonetheless, the band gap reduction can occasionally reduce the reducing or oxidising behaviour of the photocatalyst material. Photoinduced electron transfer strongly relies on the band edges of the photocatalyst material with reference to the redox potentials of the adsorbed molecules.103 The suitability of our modified materials for the overall water splitting was confirmed by aligning their band edge positions with reference to the water redox potentials. Thermodynamically, the conduction band minimum must be situated above the H+/H2 reduction potential (0 V vs. NHE), while the VBM must be located below the O2/H2O oxidation potential (1.23 V). For any semiconductor to be considered an ideal photocatalyst material for water splitting applications, the band gap must be <3.00 eV to enhance solar absorption and >1.23 eV to drive the H2 and O2 reactions.104 Since the work function depends on the surface state,105 the shift in the band edge position relative to the vacuum energy level was explored by analysing the changes in their work function. Since the VBM and CBM obtained in the DFT calculations were not on the absolute scale, the band edges cannot be directly aligned to the water redox potentials.106 Therefore, for this purpose, the values of the CBM and VBM edge positions of the monolayers and the heterostructures with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode potential were determined using the work function approach.107 For any bulk materials, the band edge calculation is an arduous task, as it entails the use of thick slabs to epitomise the bulk interior and its surface.108 However, these problems are not present in monolayers,108 making them suitable systems for calculating the band positions. The band positions can be derived from eqn (8) and (9):109,110 ECBM = −Φ + 0.5Eg(8) EVBM = −Φ − 0.5Eg(9)
Based on the calculated results, the VBM and CBM edge positions of m-BiVO4, MoS2, WS2 and the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures with respect to the H+/H2 reduction potential (0 eV versus NHE) and the O2/H2O oxidation potential (1.23 eV) are shown in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  The band alignment of m-BiVO4, MoS2, WS2 and the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures with respect to the water redox potentials. The VBM and CBM are the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum, respectively. 
Clearly, the m-BiVO4 monolayer has a weak reducing ability owing to its relatively lower conduction band minimum, which is about 0.17 eV lower than the H+/H2 potential, whereas its valence band maximum is more positive (about 2.41 eV) compared to the O2/H2O potential. Considering the water reduction potentials, the m-BiVO4 monolayer does not meet the requirement for photocatalytic H2 generation. The CBM positions of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures are 0.43, and 0.29 eV above the H+/H2 potential. Moreover, the valence band maximum for the respective systems lies at 0.40, and 0.62 eV below the H2O/O2 potential. This shows that the band alignments of the heterostructures are in favourable positions to evolve both H2 and O2. Thus, the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures are thermodynamically more suitable for H2 evolution compared to the unmodified m-BiVO4. Remarkably, the CBM of the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure is 0.26 and 0.14 eV above the CBM of the m-BiVO4(010) monolayer and WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure, respectively. This implies that the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure is more feasible for H2 production due to its strong reducing power compared to the WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure. The redox potential of Rhodamine B dye is 1.43 eV,111 which is lower than the valence band of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures. This means that direct photogenerated hole oxidation can occur in the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures. Hence, the heterostructures showed high photocatalytic performance for hydrogen generation and pollutant degradation under simulated visible light irradiation.
4. Conclusions
In this study, we employed first-principles calculations to investigate the feasibility and activity of MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures as photocatalysts in hydrogen production and pollutant degradation. For the first time, hybrid density functional calculations and a long-range dispersion correction method were performed to explore the interfacial interaction, charge transfer, electronic properties, photocatalytic activity and mechanism of the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures. The band structure results showed a narrow band gap, a suitable built-in potential and a type-II band alignment for the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures, which favour the separation of photoinduced charge carriers at the interface and visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity. The interface adhesion energy, binding energy and equilibrium distance showed that the interaction between the MS2 monolayer and the m-BiVO4(010) surface was a van der Waals interaction. The MoS2/m-BiVO4 heterostructure showed a strong reducing power towards H2 production compared to the WS2/m-BiVO4 heterostructure. The improved photocatalytic performance of the MoS2/m-BiVO4 photocatalyst was due to the role of the MoS2 monolayer as an electron acceptor with strong optical absorption coefficient, a narrow band gap, a strong oxidation and reduction ability and many reactive sites on the MoS2 surface, and due to its ability to accommodate more reactive species during the photocatalytic reaction. Thus, the MS2 monolayer can act as an effective photosensitizer for photogenerated charge carriers by forming a potential difference, as well as by tuning the band gap of m-BiVO4. Besides, the charge carriers in the MoS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure can more easily migrate to the reaction surface compared to the WS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructure due to its smaller effective mass. Considering that the MS2 monolayer coupled with m-BiVO4 can restrain the electron–hole recombination rate without lattice distortion, the heterostructures approach is better than the doping approach. Based on the electronic properties analysis, the MS2/m-BiVO4(010) heterostructures were shown to fit within the acceptable band gap and built-in potential range.
