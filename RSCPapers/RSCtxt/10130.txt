    , Accepted 17th November 2012First published on 19th November 2012AbstractTwo D–A–D systems involving benzofuran and dithienopyrrole as donor blocks and isoindigo as an acceptor unit have been synthesized and their electronic properties have been characterized by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. A preliminary evaluation of these compounds as active material in organic solar cells shows that the presence or absence of substitution at the nitrogen atom of indigo strongly affects the properties of the material and thus the performances of the resulting solar cells.
Introduction
The design of active materials based on well-defined molecules is attracting increasing interest motivated by the possibility of developing cost-effective and low environmental impact organic photovoltaic cells (OPV).1–14 Compared to polydisperse conjugated polymers,2 perfectly defined molecular donors present specific advantages in terms of reproducibility of synthesis and purification and therefore of material composition and device performances. Furthermore, from a more fundamental viewpoint, molecules allow more reliable analyses of structure–property relationships that remain a key tool for further progress in material design.1
During the past few years many classes of molecular donors have been synthesized and evaluated as donor material in both solution-processed and vacuum deposited OPV cells.1,3–11 These include triphenylamines,3 cyanines,4 squaraines,5 oligothiophenes6 diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPP),7 borondipyrromethenes,8 and many tailored π-conjugated molecules.1 The chemical structure of efficient molecular donor materials for OPV often involves a combination of donor (D) and acceptor (A) groups leading to an internal charge transfer (ICT) which produces at the same time a red shift extension of the absorption spectrum and a decrease of the HOMO level resulting in an increase of the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the OPV cell.3a
While many D–A–D donors have been synthesized in the past few years, it is only recently that D–A–D donors involving isoindigo (IsI) as a central acceptor block have been described.10 Similar to some other systems such as DPP,11 quinacridone12 or rylene diimides,13 the nitrogen atoms of IsI can be substituted by labile solubilizing groups. The thermal elimination of these labile groups allows recovering an insoluble material stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen-bonding. In this context we report here on the synthesis and preliminary evaluation in OPV cells of two D–A–D donors involving IsI as a central acceptor block and benzofuran (BF) or dithienopyrrole (DTP) as side donor units (see Chart).  
The BF donor group was selected on the basis of the high efficiency reported for OPV cells based on the parent DPP system,7,14,15 while DTP is a strong donor group already used in low band gap polymers or oligomers.2,16 On the other hand, the fixation of branched alkyl chains at the nitrogen atom of DTP allows the solubilization of the molecule while keeping free the NH group of IsI and thus allowing intermolecular hydrogen-bonding.
Experimental part
General
Solvents were purified and dried using standard protocols. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE DRX 500 spectrometer operating at 300.1 and 75.4 MHz; δ are given in ppm (relative to TMS) and coupling constants (J) in Hz. High resolution mass spectra were recorded under FAB mode on a Jeol JMS 700 spectrometer. UV-visible optical data were recorded with a Perkin Elmer lambda 19 spectrophotometer. Thermal analyses were performed using a DSC 2010 CE (TA Instruments). Cyclic voltammetry was performed on an EG&G PAR 273A potentiostat with a standard three-electrode cell with platinum electrodes and a SCE reference.
Synthesis

IDTP. 
2-(Trimethylstannyl)-N-(2-ethylhexyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (930 mg, 2.05 mmol) was added to a solution of 6,6-dibromoisoindigo (110 mg, 0.26 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (30 mg, 10 mol%) in 20 mL of DMF. The mixture was heated for 12 h at 105 °C under an inert atmosphere and cooled later to room temperature. The reaction was quenched with water and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was dried over MgSO4 and the solvent evaporated. The residue was precipitated several times with petroleum ether and chromatographed (silica gel; eluent: THF) to give 130 mg (60%) of a shiny blue solid which showed no melting point before decomposition. 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO) δ (ppm) 10.89 (s, 2H), 9.60 (d, 2H, 3J = 8.59 Hz), 7.84 (s, 2H), 7.41 (d, 2H, 3J = 5.31 Hz), 7.33 (dd, 2H, 3J = 8.58 Hz, 4J = 1.71 Hz), 7.22 (d, 2H, 3J = 5.33 Hz), 7.08 (d, 2H, 4J = 1.78 Hz), 4.17 (d, 4H), 2.00–1.89 (m, 2H), 1.34–1.17 (m, 16H), 0.87–0.77 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (500 MHz, DMSO): 169.55, 146.01, 145.57, 144.63, 139.67, 138.46, 130.99, 129.73, 125.28, 120.77, 117.29, 114.30, 113.89, 111.99, 110.02, 104.70, 50.45, 29.78, 27.73, 26.33, 23.26, 22.51, 13.81, 10.40.

IBF. 
2-Trimethylstannyl benzofuran (200 mg, 0.71 mmol) was added to a solution of 6,6′-dibromo-N,N′-(2-ethylhexyl)-isoindigo (130 mg, 0.2 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (65 mg, 20 mol%) in 20 mL of toluene. The mixture was refluxed for 12 h under an inert atmosphere and cooled later to room temperature. The reaction was quenched with water and extracted with dichloromethane.

Devices fabrication
Fullerene C60 (99+%) was purchased from MER and used as received. The ITO electrodes (10 Ohm per square, Kintec company) were cleaned in ultrasonic baths and then modified by a spun-cast layer of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083” (HC Stark) (40 nm thick), which was dried at 130 °C for 15 min. The Clevios suspension was stirred and filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane (Minisart RC 15, Sartorius) just prior to casting. A 100 nm thick layer of Al was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask, at a pressure of about 10−6 mbar. The mask geometry defined a device area of 0.28 cm2. Each ITO coated-glass substrate supported two individual devices and each batch involved a minimum of 4 devices (8 cells). After preparation, the devices were stored and characterized in an argon glovebox (200B, MBraun). The J–V curves of the devices were recorded in the dark and under illumination using a Keithley 236 source-measure unit and a homemade acquisition program. The light source was an AM1.5 Solar Constant 575 PV simulator (Steuernagel Lichttecknik, equipped with a metal halogenide lamp). The light intensity was measured by a broad-band power meter (13PEM001, Melles Griot). The efficiency values reported here are not corrected for possible solar simulator spectral mismatch or for the reflection/absorption of the glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS coated electrodes.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
6,6-Dibromoisoindigo 1 and its derivatives 6,6′-disubstituted by ethylhexyl chains (2) were synthesized according to literature procedures (Scheme 1).10 A Stille coupling with the mono-stannylated derivative of dithienopyrrole 316 in DMF in the presence of a palladium catalyst gave the target IDTP compound in 60% yield. Despite the presence of alkyl chains on both lateral DTP blocks, IDTP was insoluble in common organic solvents except for THF, probably due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. In contrast, IBF obtained in 90% by Stille coupling of the trimethylstannyl-benzofuran 417 with 2 in refluxing toluene showed excellent solubility in usual solvents.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of IDTP and IBF. 
Deep red crystals of IBF obtained from a THF solution were analyzed by X-ray diffraction. Although the quality of the crystal was limited, the data for the triclinic system show a quasi-planar molecular structure with torsion angles less than 10° for the central double bond of the IsI unit. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that both compounds are thermally stable under an inert atmosphere with a 5% weight loss at 290 °C and 357 °C for IDTP and IBF respectively. However, while IBF shows a clear melting point at 211 °C, IDTP does not melt before thermal decomposition.
Electronic properties of the donors
The electrochemical properties of the two compounds have been analyzed by cyclic voltammetry in THF (reduction) and methylene chloride (oxidation) in the presence of 0.10 M Bu4NPF6 as a supporting electrolyte. For both compounds, the CV trace shows two reversible reduction processes with cathodic peak potentials Epc1 and Epc2 associated to the formation of the radical anion and dianion respectively (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The similarity of the reduction potential for the two compounds suggests that the LUMO is essentially located on the IsI moiety. In contrast, quite different behaviors are observed upon oxidation. Thus whereas IBF undergoes a partially reversible oxidation process with an anodic peak potential Epa of 1.19 V, the CV of IDTP exhibits two oxidation processes with a first anodic peak at 0.82 V. The possible access to a second oxidation step reflects the more extended conjugated system created by the DTP blocks. For both compounds, the first oxidation process which appears partially reversible at a low scan rate becomes fully reversible at a higher scan rate. For IDTP, application of repetitive potential scans up to the onset of the second oxidation process leads to the progressive emergence of a broad redox system at a lower potential typical of the electrodeposition of an electroactive material (not shown). This coupling process is illustrated by the broad cathodic wave observed in the 0.20–0.60 V region in the reverse scan (Fig. 1).

The UV-Vis spectrum of IBF in THF presents a first maximum at 311 nm followed by two bands with maxima at 439 and 551 nm (Fig. 2). The band of lowest energy can be assigned to an internal charge transfer between the side donor block and the central IsI electron acceptor.
 Fig. 2  UV-Vis absorption spectra of IBF (top) and IDTP (bottom) in THF solution (dotted line) and as thin films spun-cast on glass (solid line). 
The spectrum of IDTP presents rather similar features with however a red shift of the maxima reflecting the stronger donor effect of the DTP block compared to BF. While IBF does not fluoresce in THF solution, IDTP presents a weak fluorescence emission with a maximum at 738 nm and a strong shoulder at 792 nm (a quantum yield of 3.0% was measured against a cresyl violet perchlorate reference). The UV-Vis absorption spectra of thin films spun-cast on glass from THF solutions are shown in Fig. 2. Compared to the solution spectrum, the spectrum of IBF presents a broadening of the absorption bands while the absorption edge extends to 700 nm corresponding to a band gap (Eg) of 1.77 eV. These effects can be attributed to intermolecular π-stacking interactions in the solid-state. We also note the emergence of a vibrational fine structure with maxima at 533, 570 and 670 nm suggesting the presence of some crystallinity in the film. Compared to IBF, the spectrum of IDTP exhibits a larger broadening of the solid state spectrum and a 37 nm red shift of λmax and a smaller optical band gap (Eg = 1.48 eV).
The effects of thermal annealing on films of the two compounds have been investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. For IBF, a 10 min thermal treatment at 75 °C produces a further red shift of the band maxima with an exaltation of the resolution of the vibrational fine structure which suggests an increased crystallinity (Fig. 3). This conclusion is confirmed by the emergence of a peak at 2θ = 5.55° in the diffractogram whereas no discernible diffraction peak was observed for the as-cast film. Further heating to 130 °C produces an increase in the diffraction intensity. Using the Bragg equation, λ = 2dsinθ (λCu-α = 1.54 Å), the d-spacing was calculated to be 15.8 Å. While this distance does not correspond to the length of the molecule (21 Å), this result suggests the existence of crystalline domains in the material. This thermally induced enhancement of crystallinity is strongly reminiscent of previous observations on DPP parent systems containing BF side groups, suggesting that this group plays a major role in this reorganization process.14,15

Bottom: X-ray diffractograms for IBF (left) and IDTP (right). Bottom trace: before annealing, middle trace: after annealing at 75 oC, top trace: after annealing at 140 oC. 
As expected a different behavior is observed for IDTP. The effects of thermal treatment appear only after 10 min annealing at 150 °C and results in only a slight decrease in absorbance indicative of the beginning of degradation. The X-ray diffractogram shows that the film presents some crystallinity before thermal treatment with a diffraction peak at 2θ = 6.5°. However, in agreement with UV-Vis results, thermal treatment does not enhance crystallinity but produces a decrease in the peak intensity consistent with the degradation of the material.
Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) methods were performed for IDTP and IBF with the Gaussian 09 program. Becke’s three-parameter gradient-corrected functional (B3LYP) with the 6-31G (d,p) basis in vacuum was used to optimize the geometry and to compute the electronic structure at the minima found. The optimized geometry of both compounds shows a quasi-planar conjugated system in agreement with the X-ray structure of IBF. The ∼15° dihedral twist angle of the central double bond of IBF is the only torsion in the structure while both side parts are coplanar. In contrast, the structure of IDTP presents small dihedral angles between each donor block and the IsI core in addition to the ∼15° dihedral torsion around the central double bond.
The molecular orbitals show that the LUMO is essentially localized on the IsI core, in agreement with the observed minor influence of the end groups on the reduction potential (Fig. 4). In contrast, as the HOMO is distributed over the entire π-system, its energy level varies with the electron-donor effect of the end-groups. The calculated energy levels of the HOMOs and LUMOs are in qualitative agreement with CV data and show that IBF presents lower HOMO and LUMO levels than IDTP.

A preliminary evaluation of the potentialities of the two compounds as donor material in OPV cells has been carried out on two types of devices, solution-processed bulk heterojunctions (BHJ) using PC61BM as an electron acceptor and bilayer planar heterojunctions (PHJ) based on a spun-cast donor layer and vacuum deposited C60. BHJ cells were prepared by spin-casting active films from a chlorobenzene solution with a 1:2 donor/PC61BM mass ratio, and a total concentration of 30 mg mL−1, on an ITO electrode pre-coated with 40 nm of PEDOT:PSS. The devices were then completed by vacuum deposition of a 100 nm aluminum electrode.
Despite multiple attempts with various donor/acceptor ratios, all devices based on IDTP gave very poor performances. Under AM 1.5 simulated solar illumination with an incident power light of 100 mW cm−2, the best BHJ cell delivers a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of only 0.15 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.39 V which combined with a poor filling factor (FF) of 0.16 results in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.01% (Table 2). In the case of IBF the BHJ cells show a Voc of 0.57 V, a Jsc of 0.20 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 0.05%. As could be anticipated from UV-Vis and X-ray data, thermal treatment of the cells based on the two donors leads to contrasting effects. For IDTP, only a degradation of the already low performances is observed. In contrast, for IBF thermal treatment increases the various photovoltaic parameters leading to a PCE of 0.26%.

The limited available amounts of donor materials were insufficient to carry out an extensive optimization of the BHJ cells, therefore the two compounds have been evaluated in bi-layer PHJ cells. Although often less efficient than BHJ, PHJ generally lead to more reproducible results. PHJ cells have been fabricated by spin-casting a typically 20 nm donor film on an ITO electrode pre-coated with a 40 nm film of PEDOT-PSS. A 50 nm layer of C60 was then thermally evaporated under vacuum and the cells were completed by a 100 nm thick aluminium electrode.
As shown in Table 2, IBF gave a Jsc of 0.93 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.80 V and a PCE of 0.15%. A PCE of 0.19% was obtained from IDTP with a Voc of 0.51 V and a Jsc of 1.20 mA cm−2. As expected thermal treatment produces contrasting effects on the two types of cells. For IDTP heating was always detrimental with a twofold decrease of PCE. For IBF, 10 min thermal annealing at 110 °C leads to an increase of Jsc, Voc and FF resulting in a PCE of 0.65% (Fig. 5). However, the S shape of the I–V curves suggests some interfacial problems suggesting that a judicious insertion of interfacial buffer layers could improve the cell performances.

The hole-mobility of the two donors has been determined by the space-charge limited current method on hole-only devices of structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor/gold. Mobility values of 6.8 × 10−3 and 7.6 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for IBF and IDTP respectively. The higher mobility of IBF is consistent with the better efficiency of this donor.
Reynolds and coworkers have described an IsI based D–A–D system with two 2-hexyl-bithienyl side donor groups10 and a PCE of 1.25 ± 0.37% was reported in a recent paper.18 In this context, the modest PCE obtained in our case seems to confirm that IsI-based systems will not rank among the most efficient molecular donor materials for OPV. However, it should be underlined that, as shown by recent works, for a given central acceptor block the efficiency of D–A–D systems is subject to considerable variations depending on the nature of the side groups in a way impossible to predict on the basis of our present understanding of structure–property relationships.14,15
Conclusion
Two D–A–D molecular donors based on a central IsI acceptor block have been synthesized. Optical, thermal and X-ray diffraction studies provided consistent results showing that the presence of a free imide group on the IsI block leads to intermolecular hydrogen-bonding that renders the material insoluble in spite of the presence of two branched alkyl chains. The low efficiency observed in the resulting OPV cells suggest that hydrogen bonding locks the molecular packing into an organization unfavorable for efficient exciton diffusion and/or charge transport. However, substitution of the nitrogen atom by a single branched alkyl chain solubilizes the material and allows thermally induced reorganization and thus improved efficiency. On the other hand, these results suggest that H-bonding could be an interesting tool for the stabilization of active OPV materials provided that appropriate rules for molecular engineering could be established, which of course implies further investigations of structure–property relationships in this class of compounds.
