    , Accepted 10th September 2012First published on 13th September 2012AbstractThe large absorption coefficient of iron pyrite (FeS2) nanocrystals coupled with their low-cost and vast-abundance shows great promise as a potential photovoltaic absorber. Here, we demonstrate that bulk heterojunction (BHJ) nanostructures consisting of 80 nm FeS2 nanocubes (NCs) and 4 nm CdS quantum dot (QD) matrix, lead to a well-defined percolation network, which significantly improved open-circuit voltage (Voc) to 0.79 V and power conversion efficiency of 1.1% under AM 1.5 solar illumination. The localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) arising from p-type colloidal FeS2 NCs exhibit plasmonic photoelectron conversion. Our approach can be applied to a wide range of colloidal nanocrystals exhibiting the LSPRs effect and is compatible with solution processing, thereby offering a general tactic to enhancing the efficiency of all inorganic BHJ solar cells and LSPRs-based NIR photodetectors.
Introduction
Iron pyrite (FeS2) is an attractive semiconducting material consisting of non-toxic and earth abundant elements (iron is the fourth most abundant in the earth's crust, and is also the cheapest metallic element to extract from Nature).1–4 In addition to its abundance, FeS2 exhibits a remarkable absorption coefficient level above 105 cm−1 at Eg + 0.1 eV.5–7 This high absorption provides a unique opportunity to incorporate a very thin absorber layer in solar cells to capture most of the incident solar radiation.7–9 This thickness can be compared to 1.5–3 μm for current thin film CdTe solar cells or >200 μm for single crystal Si cells.10–12 The use of Fe in photovoltaics (PV) was proposed nearly 25 years ago in the FeS2 pyrite form, but the low photovoltage, sulfur deficiencies and poor structure uniformity has limited their PV applications.1,13 As such, FeS2 as a promising material for commercially viable PV cells has not yet reached fruition.14 Recent studies have revealed that solution processed colloidal nanocrystals have an overwhelming influence on the cost efficiency of PV cells, compared to their bulk counterparts.15–22 The properties of colloidal semiconducting nanocrystals are strongly associated with their composition, shape, phase and size.23,24 Numerous studies have demonstrated that the performance and applications of nanocrystals are closely related to the free carrier densities, which would give us a precious opportunity to tailor and fine-tune the properties of crystals.25–29 For instance, both computational and experimental studies have shown that the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of colloidal semiconducting nanocrystals is highly sensitive to their carrier densities.30 Luther, et al.31 and Buonsanti et al.32 reported the carrier density and dielectric constant dependent plasmonic resonance of Cu2−xS and AlxZnO quantum dots (QDs), respectively. In addition, we recently reported a longer carrier lifetime of FeS2 nanoparticles compared to their two-dimensional nanoplate counterparts.33 Considering the current level of understanding and the recent resurgence of interest in Fe bearing PV materials, in this report, we have undertaken an integrated study that provides new insight into the FeS2 (p-type) based all inorganic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PV devices. We demonstrate that FeS2 nanocubes (NCs) synthesized via a seeded growth own LSPRs and can be used to efficiently enhance photoabsorption and hole extraction in all inorganic BHJ FeS2 NCs:CdS QD solar cells by injecting an electron from the FeS2 into the conduction band of the CdS QD percolation network, thus effectively extracting the positively charged hole. In contrast to a bilayer device employing FeS2 NCs and CdS QDs (power conversion efficiency: PCE = 0.00025%, Jsc = 0.02 mA cm−2), the use of BHJ significantly improves the PCE by more than three orders magnitude to PCE ∼ 1.1% with Jsc of 3.9 mA cm−2. Furthermore, we show that the LSPR of FeS2 NCs exhibits plasmonic photoelectron conversion by near infrared (NIR) light excitation, which offers the opportunity to enhance further the efficiency for the colloidal nanocrystal-based solar cells and opens up a new avenue for LSPR-based IR photodetectors.
Experimental
FeS2 QDs were synthesized using a modified protocol from Puthussery et al.5,33 The FeS2 NCs were prepared using the seeded growth with an additional second hot injection after the QD synthesis. Briefly, the FeS2 NCs were synthesized by injection of excess sulfur into decomposed metal precursor (FeCl2) followed by growth, then the second injection of FeCl2 (See ESI† for the detailed synthesis procedure). All syntheses were done under Argon atmosphere using standard Schlenk line techniques. Aliquots were taken at different times to assess growth. After the reaction was finished, the solution was allowed to cool to ∼100 °C and halted with an injection of methanol and crashed out using centrifugation in a N2 glovebox. The resultant FeS2 NCs capped with octadecylamine (ODA) were redispersed in chloroform for storage and also for use in the BHJ solar cell fabrication. The CdS QDs are synthesized following our previous report.17 Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar devices were measured in a nitrogen atmosphere glovebox with a Keithley 6487 source meter. The light response was measured under 100 mW cm−2 illumination from an AM 1.5 solar simulator. Transmittance and absorbance spectra were measured with a Shimadzu UV-vis-NIR dual-beam spectrophotometer. A FEI FEG analytical transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 200 kV and equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) was used for structural and chemical analysis. Device surface morphology was investigated using a Digital Instruments Dimension 3000 atomic force microscope (AFM) operated in contact mode and a Leo 1550 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) using 5 kV.
Results and discussion
Compared to 15 ± 3 nm FeS2 QD seeds synthesized during the first injection (Fig. 1a), the FeS2 NCs after 90 min aging of the second injection, shown in the TEM image of Fig. 1c, are within an average size range of 80 ± 5 nm. The presence of crystalline pyrite in both synthesized QD and NC products was confirmed with X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and the synthesized pyrite QDs and NCs are kept in the N2 glovebox for solar cell processing to avoid the oxidation issues (ESI, Fig. S1†). The particle shape and size of the various FeS2 NCs are similar, as indicated in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of Fig. S1 (ESI†). By increasing the aging time to 150 min, the FeS2 NCs show an average size of 120 ± 5 nm (Fig. 1e). In this study, we use excess sulfur during the first hot-injection step which could slightly affect the final stoichiometry of FeS2 NCs and thus change carrier concentrations. FeS2 NC syntheses with varied optical properties have been investigated in other literature works.34–36 The EDS spectra in Fig. 1 obtained from FeS2 QDs and NCs confirmed the chemical composition and stoichiometry of FeS2 under different aging time. The EDS spectrum from the FeS2 QDs (Fig. 1b) shows less iron contents (31.2 at.%), and the ratio between iron and sulfur (49.9 at.%) is 1:1.6. The EDS spectrum from the FeS2 NCs aging for 90 min (Fig. 1d), shows a 1:1.98 ratio between iron (31.3 at.%) and sulfur (61.9 at.%), which is consistent with FeS2. Increasing the aging time to 150 min (Fig. 1f), the ratio between iron (32.2 at.%) and sulfur (58.9 at.%) shows 1:1.83. The stoichiometry between iron and sulfur elements affects the charge carrier density within FeS2 nanocrystals, which are responsible for the LSPR shift.

The photoabsorption spectra of FeS2 NCs are shown in Fig. 2. Before the second injection of Fe precursor, the pre-formed FeS2 QDs show ∼15 nm diameter (Fig. 1a) and a broad absorbance from 400 to 1000 nm, similar to previously reported FeS2 QDs.5 However, the absorbance spectrum of the FeS2 NCs after the second injection reaches a minimum around 600 nm, then rises for longer wavelengths due to free carrier intra band absorption. From the UV-vis-NIR spectra of these FeS2 NCs, we find NIR wavelength absorbance for all presented NCs. If this NIR absorbance derives from free carriers, it should show a stoichiometric dependence.37,38 FeS2 NCs for 90 min annealing show the well-pronounced LSPR absorbance intensity, while the FeS2 NCs for 120 min annealing show somewhat less absorbance and the 150 min annealed FeS2 NCs show further decreased absorbance intensity in the NIR region. The aging process has been confirmed to influence the stoichiometry of FeS2 NCs (Fig. 1), which is mainly responsible for the NIR absorption spectra shift. We could identify comparable trends in previously published work for FeS2 materials.5,34 The similarity of the spectra (for similarly sized NCs) is quite consistent. It is shown here that the optical properties are largely independent of the synthesis procedure. Though the photoabsorption could be due to scattering or sample impurities, in this study, we assign the NIR absorption bands to LSPRs by studying the solvent effect on the absorption band position. We compared NIR spectra of the FeS2 NCs in different solvents: chloroform and tetrachloroethylene (TCE) with refractive indices of 1.44 and 1.51, respectively (Fig. 2b). The absorption band redshifts with increasing solvent refractive index, which is expected from the LSPR feature, and a systematic solvent dependence study is planned for the future. The spectral shift gets complicated due to the ligand shell contribution to the effective local medium index. On the basis of a semi log plot of the data (Fig. S2 of ESI†), we estimated the band gap of the FeS2 NCs to be 1.1–1.2 eV, which is similar to the FeS2 QDs. Since the dielectric function of FeS2 in the NIR region is dominated by free carriers, the band gap contribution can be neglected. This further confirms that the NIR photoabsorption of FeS2 NCs is due to the LSPRs. Rigorous measurements of the absorption coefficient of FeS2 films made from these NCs and QDs are ongoing.
Taken together, the NIR absorption of these FeS2 NCs can be interpreted in terms of valence band free carriers (positive holes), giving rise to a Drude term with corresponding FeS2 NIR plasmon absorption (Fig. 2). Although metals provide the best evidence of plasmons due to their high density of free electrons, LSPR have been observed in different colloidal nanocrystals, which have lower carrier densities.31 In the presented FeS2 NCs, the majority charge carriers are positive holes, instead of electrons, which are the main carriers in metals. The LSPR in FeS2 NCs can provide a substantial increase of photon absorption in the solar cells, leading to the higher total photocurrent and possibly higher photovoltaic efficiency of the whole device.

All inorganic BHJ solar cells consisting of FeS2:CdS structures were prepared by first dissolving the FeS2 NCs and CdS QDs into chloroform and octane, respectively, and then mixing these two solutions together at different volume ratios (Fig. 3a). The FeS2:CdS blended solution was spun onto an ITO patterned glass slide three times to form a 500 nm thick film. The sequential 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) and hydrazine layer-by-layer (LbL) ligand exchange treatments are carried on after spin-casting each photoactive layer. The coated devices were heat-treated at 145 °C for 10 min. Finally, the top Al electrode was evaporated and the final device area was defined as the overlap between the top and bottom electrodes (see ESI† for the detailed solar cell fabrication). We selected CdS QDs due to the large band offset (1.1 eV) between the valence band of FeS2 and the conduction band edge of CdS, which can potentially address the long-existing issue of low open circuit voltage (Voc) of FeS2 based solar cells. Fig. 3b and c show the UV-vis-NIR absorbance and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of BHJ films produced from the mixture of FeS2 NCs and CdS QDs. The LSPR absorption feature of FeS2 NCs is clearly resolved, indicating the enhanced photoabsorption of the photoactive medium after CdS QDs blending. The PL spectral intensities of the FeS2/CdS films are significantly quenched, presumably due to the efficient nonradiative channel for charge transfer from FeS2 to the CdS phase.

Fig. 4a and b show representative TEM images of the 1:1 mixed FeS2 NCs and CdS QDs. Fig. 4a shows a TEM image of the randomly blended FeS2 NCs distributed in the CdS QD matrix. Because the diameters of CdS QDs are far below the dimensions of the FeS2 NC phase, we achieved a BHJ nanostructure with a well-defined interface and no voids, observed in Fig. 4b, which enables the efficient exciton dissociation of the FeS2:CdS BHJ nanostructure. A key to the blending process is to dissolve both FeS2 NCs and CdS QDs in compatible solvents, allowing them to interact with each other under conditions that preserve the stability and photophysical properties of both components. In the present study, the FeS2 NCs and CdS QDs were dissolved in chloroform and in octane, respectively. The cross-sectional SEM image of a typical complete device (Fig. 4c) shows that FeS2:CdS film forms the percolation network and the FeS2 NCs are distributed across the 500 nm thick photoactive layer within the CdS QD matrix. This architecture has advantages over a bi-layer system because the surface roughness and voids among FeS2 NCs due to the phase segregation are minimized and the FeS2:CdS interface is maximized, improving dissociation of photo-generated excitons in FeS2, which occurs due to the conduction band offset at the interface. In comparison with the FeS2 NCs of usually poor intergrain connectivity and substrate coverage that occur in single component FeS2 solar cells, the image suggests that the CdS QDs and the blending process plays a crucial role in templating FeS2 NCs across the vertical direction and in improving the interface between FeS2 and CdS components, giving better grain connectivity and fewer voids.

It was recently demonstrated that the performance of QD solar cells can be improved by ligand-exchange treatments involving both EDT and hydrazine in a sequential manner during the deposition of the photoactive layer.39 The beneficial effect of the sequential ligand exchange has been attributed to a shortened QD spacing, improved cross-linking of QDs, and improved surface passivation.40,41 The photoconductivity of different QDs has been shown to be greatly enhanced as a consequence of the ligand exchange treatment.39 We performed the ligand exchange in all inorganic FeS2:CdS BHJ systems using LbL EDT and hydrazine treatment to shorten the interdistance between FeS2 NCs and CdS QDs. The FeS2 NCs and CdS QDs were originally capped with ODA and n-butylamine surfactants, respectively, which were removed through a sequential EDT and hydrazine treatment in the acetonitrile solvent. The photoactive layer thickness can be enhanced from 250 nm to 500 nm by increasing the deposition numbers from 1-layer to 3-layer (ESI†). Fig. S3† shows the thickness dependent J–V characteristics of photoactive FeS2:CdS BHJ layer by changing the deposition number. The 250 nm thickness (about 3 times larger than the size of FeS2 NCs) of the photoactive layer has a larger surface roughness, as shown in Fig. S3a,† which reduce the PV performance. By increasing the deposition number and thus the thickness of photoactive layer to 500 nm, we observe that the device exhibits a PCE approximately three times higher than that of the thin device, indicating that the photogenerated charge carrier collection is significantly higher than that of the thin device. As shown in the previous report, a 100 nm thickness FeS2 film could absorb most incident photons.7 Therefore, the enhancement seen here should not be completely attributed to the increased photoabsorbance, but to improved morphology and interface for exciton dissociation and charge collection. Increasing the film thickness, which simultaneously enhances the CdS QD loading and interfacial area, smoothed the film surface and filled voids among FeS2 NCs to reduce the short-circuit pathways. The resulting high charge carrier concentration and charge transport strongly influences the photovoltaic performance of all inorganic FeS2:CdS BHJ cells. Further increasing the film thickness does not show a better performance due to the film nonuniformity and the compromised charge collection.
Different volume ratios of FeS2:CdS BHJ nanostructures (2:1, 1:1 and 1:2 ratios for 500 nm thickness) have been prepared to investigate the concentration effect of FeS2 NCs. The surface morphologies of devices were investigated using AFM (Fig. 5a and b, respectively). Following these promising morphology measurements, devices based on layer-by-layer (LbL) and ligand-exchange treated films were prepared, as described in Fig. 3a. Fig. 5c shows the J–V characteristics of the all inorganic FeS2:CdS BHJ solar devices at different volume ratios, using three-layer deposition with subsequent EDT and hydrazine treated films as a photoactive layer. Compared to the no or relatively low photovoltaic performance of FeS2, CdS Schottky and FeS2/CdS bi-layer devices (Fig. S4 of ESI†), our results show that a significant improvement of the photovoltaic performance is achieved in all inorganic BHJ PV devices fabricated using solution blending, LbL and ligand exchange processes. Devices at a 1:2 volume ratio of FeS2 NCs and CdS QDs show an average JSC of 1.9 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.65 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.28 under simulated AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2), and gives a PCE of 0.346%. The FeS2:CdS BHJ system at 1:1 volume ratio giving an improved average JSC of 3.9 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.79 V, FF of 0.36 and the PCE of 1.1% which are measured over 100 devices (further increasing the FeS2 loading will reduce the performance due to the increased surface roughness by the FeS2 NC aggregation). The enhancement in JSC and Voc of pyrite BHJ solar cells could be attributed to the following two factors: (1) increased charge separation efficiency, which is enabled by the enhanced photoabsorption and interfacial area between FeS2 NCs and CdS QDs; and (2) the enhanced charge collection efficiency, which is enabled by the bicontinuous percolated nanomorphology, providing more effective transport pathways for both electrons and holes.17 The formation of an FeS2 percolation network and its effect on charge transport is supported by the fact that as the FeS2 volume concentration is increased, the JSC increases to a maximum value at 50 vol%, and then decreases for a higher loading (Fig. 5d). The LSPRs of FeS2 NCs (1000–1400 nm) could provide a substantial increase of photoabsorption in the solar cells. It should be noted that the plasmonic photoelectrons are readily decayed before being harvested.42 In this study, the fast charge transfer between semiconducting donor FeS2 NCs and acceptor CdS QDs enables the photoelectron collection from the LSPRs of the FeS2 phase. All inorganic FeS2–CdS BHJ solar cells demonstrate NIR plasmonic photoelectron conversion under the 35 mW cm−2 NIR light source (1100–1300 nm), showing great promise for NIR light harvesting (Fig. S5 of ESI†).

Conclusion
In conclusion, we present a facile and simple method to synthesize LSPR FeS2 nanocubes and control the interface and morphology of all inorganic FeS2:CdS BHJ solar cells, enabling a large photovoltage of 0.79 V and PCE of 1.1% under the AM 1.5 illumination. The blending of FeS2 NCs with CdS QDs results in not only the controllable dispersion of FeS2 NCs within the CdS QD matrix, but also stronger interfacial interaction between FeS2 NCs and CdS QDs. The formation of bicontinuous donor/acceptor phases and a well-defined interface in the BHJ photoactive film through layer-by-layer and sequential ligand exchange treatment can greatly enhance charge separation and transport efficiency, which is essential for all inorganic BHJ solar cells in comparison to the FeS2/CdS bi-layer heterostructures. The results shown here represent a general tactic for increasing the efficiency of all inorganic BHJ solar cells based on FeS2 nanomaterials via enhancing the interfacial interactions and controlling the nanomorphology between the electron donor and acceptor materials.
