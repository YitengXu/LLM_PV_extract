    , Accepted 20th December 2013First published on 23rd December 2013AbstractAmorphous precursor compounds for CuInSe2 particles and films were prepared using a microwave enhanced method in aqueous solution. In this simple and rapid reaction, the precursor compounds were synthesized with uniform morphology and amorphous phase under microwave heating at 180 °C for 30 min and a pH value of 5. This amorphous compound was used as a precursor for the preparation of pure chalcopyrite CuInSe2 particles by a post reduction process. The post reduction processes were carried out in the presence of selenium powder in an Ar (2% H2–98% Ar) atmosphere at different temperatures (300 °C, 400 °C & 500 °C) for 3 h. We find that the pure chalcopyrite CuInSe2 particles prepared (at 500 °C) in this approach are suitable for the formation of uniform, crystalline and dense CuInSe2 thin films for further application in solar cells. Pure, porous and uniform CuInSe2 films were obtained using electrophoretic deposition techniques followed by annealing. The as-prepared amorphous precursor compounds and chalcopyrite CuInSe2 particles were characterized by XRD, SEM, EDX elemental analysis and ICP.
1. Introduction
The three important requirements of a photovoltaic device for large-scale terrestrial use are low cost, good efficiency, and stability.1 The chalcopyrite semiconductor CuInSe2 of the I–III–VI2 families with superior properties, such as its suitable direct band gap, high absorption coefficient, low cost and possibility for either n- and p-type conductivity, has attracted a great deal of interest with regards to possible photovoltaic applications.2–5 Solar cells based on chalcopyrite materials with theoretical solar cell conversion efficiencies of 27–32% have been predicted6 and up to now, a photovoltaic device of CuInSe2 with a solar cell conversion efficiency of 19.6% has been reported.7 The device performance of CuInSe2 based solar cells largely depends on the quality and the properties of the CuInSe2 particles, which in turn directly relate to its methods and the conditions of preparation.
In the past few years, several methods have been employed to prepare CuInSe2 particles, such as electrodeposition,8 spray pyrolysis,9,10 sputtering11 co-evaporation,12 selenization,13 solid-state reactions involving pure metal powders by microwave heating14 and some other techniques.15 However, in almost all of these methods, it is difficult to maintain satisfactory stoichiometry as well as improve their morphology and crystallinity with lower temperatures and pressures.16
Since the shape, size, and dimensionality of chalcopyrite materials are vital parameters for their properties,17 developing a suitable method to synthesize CuInSe2 materials with better stoichiometry and morphology is of interest and importance for their further application.18 The synthesis of nanoparticles in aqueous solution has some particular advantages because the method is economical, simple to operate, and environmentally-friendly.19–21 However, this method requires longer reaction times, high temperatures and it is difficult to control the particle size via traditional heating. Within the past few years, it has been suggested that microwave (MW) irradiation can be used to improve the drawbacks of hydrothermal routes, with advantages such as shorter reaction times, increased product yields, lower cost, and a higher purity of products as a result of reduced unwanted side reactions and so on.22–25
Consequently, it is anticipated that a semiconductor can be synthesized first into an amorphous precursor with the desired composition via a microwave-assisted route. The obtained precursor powder can be further processed to introduce an absorber layer for thin film solar cells by employing techniques like electrophoretic deposition (EPD). There are many advantages to this technique over other deposition methods, such as sputtering, thermal evaporation, doctor-blade etc. For example,26–28 higher deposition rates can be easily achieved by the EPD method, resulting in quick deposition in addition to its reproducibility. It is also low cost and an efficient technique with control over the thickness and morphology of the films by controlling the applied current or potential. In particular, EPD has the flexibility to deposit films even on uneven shapes and sizes and can be extended to a large scale for commercial applications. Another advantage of this process is that it can be carried out at moderate temperatures, thereby reducing the possible deterioration of the source and product materials.26–28
Herein, we report a rapid microwave-assisted process in aqueous solution for the synthesis of uniform and amorphous precursor compounds for the preparation of pure crystalline CuInSe2 particles by a post reduction technique. The precursor powder can be further deposited by EPD followed by a thermal treatment to produce chalcopyrite CuInSe2 thin films. The characterization of the materials accompanied with discussions are also given.
2. Experimental section
Chemicals
All the reactants and solvents were used without further purification. Indium(III) chloride (InCl3, 99.995%) and ethanol (CH3CH2OH, 95%) were both purchased from Acros Organic. Acetone (99.9%) and iodine (99, 8%) were both purchased from Aldrich. Copper(II) chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O tech., 95%) was purchased from JANSSEN CHIMICA. Sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) was purchased from Fisher Scientific and used as a source of selenium.
Microwave syntheses
Microwave syntheses were performed in a single mode CEM Discover System operating at 300 W and 2.45 GHz. The sealed solution was heated at different temperatures (120 °C, 140 °C, 160 °C and 180 °C) with a microwave power of 100 W for 30 minutes. The reaction was rapidly cooled using high-pressure air following the termination of the reaction.
Synthesis of the amorphous precursor compounds
An amorphous precursor compound, which is a precursor of the CuInSe2 particles, was prepared by a microwave enhanced method in aqueous solution at different reaction temperatures and pH values (1, 3, 5 & 7). Further reduction processes of these precursors in the presence of selenium powder were carried out to obtain pure chalcopyrite CuInSe2 particles. For a typical synthesis, 0.5 mmol of Na2SeSO3, 0.25 mmol of InCl3 and 0.25 mmol of CuCl2·2H2O were added to 6 mL of deionized water and mixed together. The mixture was stirred and sonicated for 10 minutes, respectively. The solution was sealed and heated at different reaction temperatures (120, 140, 160 & 180 °C) at 100 W microwave power for 30 minutes. The products were collected after washing with deionized water and ethanol, centrifugation and filtration followed by drying in a vacuum at 80 °C for 6 h.
Formation of the crystalline CuInSe2 nanoparticles
Pure crystalline CuInSe2 particles were obtained after the reduction of the amorphous precursor compounds in the presence of selenium powder in a 2% H2–98% Ar atmosphere at 500 °C for 3 h.
Electrophoretic deposition
The amorphous precursor compounds synthesized by the microwave method were added into a mixture of solvents (acetone:ethanol = 3:1 v/v) with a concentration of 10 g of powder per litre of solvent. An iodine pellet, which acts as a proton source, was added to the mixture of solvents with a concentration of 0.6 g of iodine per litre of solvent and allows the solution to form a stable and uniform suspension under ultrasonication for 5 h. The zeta potentials for the suspension of the amorphous precursor compounds versus the pH value are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† At zeta potential where the solution was highly dispersed with no precipitation and good stability was chosen. A suspension of the amorphous precursor compounds with a zeta potential of −30 mV was used for the electrophoretic deposition. A molybdenum-coated soda-lime glass (substrate) was employed as the working electrode or anode and stainless steel as the counter electrode or cathode with a distance of 1 cm in between. The electrophoresis deposition was carried out at applied voltages of 20 V, 40 V, 60 V and 80 V for 90 s.
Formation of the crystalline CuInSe2 films
The crystalline CuInSe2 films were prepared by electrophoretic deposition techniques using a suspension of the amorphous precursor compounds followed by thermal annealing at various temperatures (500, 550 & 600 °C) and times (1 h, 5 h & 10 h).
Characterization
Images of the as-prepared samples were obtained using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JEM-6500F FESEM) and TEM (Philips Tecnai 20 G2-field emission gun with a maximum acceleration voltage of 200 keV). The elemental compositions of the particles were studied using Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX elemental analysis, JSM 6500) and Inductively Coupled Plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP, Continuous-Kontron S-35, Germany). X-ray Diffraction measurements (XRD, Rigaku Dmax-B, Japan) were carried out using a Cu Kα radiation source that was operated at 40 kV and 100 mA. The X-ray diffractogram was obtained at a scan rate of 0.05 deg s−1 for 2θ between 20° and 80°. The composition and the oxidation states of the elements in the CuInSe2 films were measured using X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) (PHI, 1600S).
3. Results and discussion
Images of the amorphous precursor compounds synthesized at different temperatures were recorded by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 1. The image reveals that the powders synthesized at a temperature of 180 °C have a uniform morphology (spherical nanoparticles) with quite a uniform size distribution.

In order to explain the formation mechanism and the exact stoichiometric composition of the amorphous precursor compounds, the reaction conditions were adjusted and carried out at different temperatures and pH values. The results of the elemental compositions of the amorphous precursor compounds synthesized by a microwave enhanced hydrothermal route at various reaction temperatures were obtained using ICP and EDX analyses, as summarized in Table 1. The results indicate that a stoichiometric ratio close to the theoretical value was achieved by raising the synthesis temperature to 180 °C. The approximate ratios of the constituent elements in the precursor compounds estimated by both EDX and ICP elemental analyses for Cu:In:Se are 0.99:1:2.19 and 0.94:1.03:2.02 respectively, which are close to the stoichiometric value of 1:1:2 at the reaction temperature of 180 °C. Both the EDX and SEM data show that precursors with high uniformity and the best stoichiometric ratio could be achieved by a reaction temperature of 180 °C at a reaction time of 30 min with only slight coarsening of the particle size.

The pH value of the aqueous solution could also affect the morphology and composition in the hydrothermal synthesis. The results in Table 2 show that compounds with better elemental ratios were obtained in an acidic environment (pH 3–5). However, at a pH value of 1, the composition become disproportionate. This might be caused by the formation of copper(I) selenide or copper(II) selenide. A uniform morphology of the amorphous precursor compounds with the best stoichiometry was achieved at a pH value of 5. The images of the amorphous precursor compounds synthesized at different pH values are compared in Fig. 2.

For comparison, the amorphous precursor compounds were synthesized in an autoclave at 180 °C with different reaction times. The morphologies of the amorphous precursor compounds which were prepared by the autoclave are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1). Based on our experimental results, a uniform morphology for the amorphous precursor compounds synthesized by a hydrothermal method using an autoclave can be only obtained for a reaction time of at least 10 h. As a result, microwave heating indeed shows a great contribution for low cost, short reaction times and the potential for scaled-up production. Finally, the phase and the crystallographic structures of the precursor compounds were determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and are shown in Fig. 3. It shows that the precursor compound is amorphous with no evident crystalline phase.

Primarily, the amorphous precursor compounds could be reduced to obtain chalcopyrite CuInSe2 particles in the presence of selenium powder at 300 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C in a 2% H2 and 98% Ar atmosphere for 3 h. The SEM images in Fig. 4(a–b) show the morphological features of the chalcopyrite CuInSe2 after reduction of the precursor at 500 °C and the treatment led to aggregated CuInSe2 powders. The structural evolution after the reduction of the precursors at various temperatures was investigated from the XRD data (Fig. 5). As the reduction temperature increases, three well-defined characteristic peaks at 2θ = 26°, 44° and 52.5°, corresponding to the diffraction of the (112), (204, 220) and (116, 312) planes, were clearly identified. This confirmed the formation of a typical chalcopyrite phase of CuInSe2 with a tetragonal structure.29 The reduction temperature was found to be optimal at 500 °C and a pure chalcopyrite crystalline structure was produced. Therefore, after initial trials, the reduction condition was set to be 500 °C in a 2% H2 and 98% Ar atmosphere for 3 h. However, the elemental ratio of the CuInSe2 powders measured by EDX deviated slightly from its theoretical value, as seen in Fig. 4(b).

To prove the processability of the as-prepared amorphous precursor, an electrophoretic deposition technique was employed to prepare an absorber layer for thin film solar cells. CuInSe2 films were produced by electrophoretic deposition of the as-prepared amorphous precursor on a molybdenum-coated glass followed by thermal reduction. As seen in Fig. 6, pure crystalline CuInSe2 phases could be obtained after thermal reduction of the films. Three well-defined characteristic peaks at 2θ = 26°, 44° and 52.5°, corresponding to the diffraction of the (112), (204, 220), and (116, 312) planes, were clearly identified. This confirmed the formation of a typical chalcopyrite phase of CuInSe2 with a tetragonal structure.29 The diffraction peaks for MoSe2 and Mo appeared because the CuInSe2 film was deposited onto a molybdenum coated soda-lime glass substrate and as a result, the reaction of the Mo glass with the porous film during selenization may lead to the formation of MoSe2, while the Mo peaks come from the substrate (a molybdenum coated soda-lime glass). The trend in the grain sizes for the deposited films was not obvious, maybe due to the small difference among the annealing conditions. SEM images of the CuInSe2 films fabricated by electrophoretic deposition followed by annealing at 600 °C for 1 h, 5 h and 10 h are shown in Fig. 7(a)–(c). Fig. 7(d) shows a representative cross-sectional image of the CuInSe2 films fabricated by electrophoretic deposition followed by annealing at 600 °C for 10 h. Based on the SEM cross-section measurement, the thicknesses of the CuInSe2 films prepared by electrophoretic deposition at different applied voltages and deposition times are shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† The surface morphologies of the films are porous yet uniform. Although engineering work still remains to optimize the whole process, these results demonstrate that using the as-prepared amorphous precursor compounds to produce crystalline CuInSe2 particles (via post reduction) or films (via electrophoretic deposition) is a viable approach for solar cell applications.

Overall, the proposed route involves more processing steps, i.e. film formation and thermal treatment, than a direct synthesis of chalcopyrite nanoparticles. However, it provides an alternative for better control over the composition and crystal growth, which are critical to the conversion efficiency of thin film solar cells. The application of the amorphous precursor is expected to bring substantial benefits and flexibility in forming an absorber layer of CuInSe2 and other similar chalcopyrite compounds, provided that the film formation and annealing conditions can be further optimized. The TEM (Fig. S3a, ESI†), HRTEM image (Fig S3b, ESI†) and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. S3c, ESI†) for the as-deposited CuInSe2 films via electrophoretic deposition of the amorphous precursor compounds followed the annealing at 600 °C for 10 h. The lattice fringes in the HRTEM images (Fig. S3b, ESI†) confirm that the CuInSe2 films formed from the amorphous precursors are purely crystalline. Furthermore, in the HRTEM image of CuInSe2 (in Fig. S3b, ESI†), the observed d-spacing is about 0.3 nm and complies with the (112) lattice spacing of chalcopyrite CuInSe2 nanoparticles. The crystallographic diffraction patterns (Fig. S3c, ESI†) possess several rings composed of many discrete spots, and the rings match well with the (112), (220)/(204) and (116)/(312) reflections of tetragonal CuInSe2.18
The XPS data for the as-deposited CuInSe2 films are shown in Fig. 8. The binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 was 932.45 eV, which indicates the copper was reduced from Cu2+ (binding energy centered at 942 eV) to Cu+, corresponding to the binding in CuInSe2. The FWHM for the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peaks were 1.9 and 2.3 eV, respectively, and these are also in good agreement with the reported values for Cu+.30–32 The oxidation states of Cu, In and Se are found to be +1, +3 and −2 respectively.

Reaction mechanisms
Although intermediate products, such as In2Se3 and CuSe, have been reported in the XRD patterns of CuInSe2 particles,33 these intermediate products did not appear in our amorphous precursor compounds, as seen in the XRD result in Fig. 3. This suggests that all the intermediate products in the preparation of the precursor compounds were amorphous. Therefore, based on our current experimental results and literature, we propose the following possible reaction mechanism for the formation of amorphous compounds and their transformation to crystalline CuInSe2. Na2SeO3 + CuCl2 → CuSeO3 + NaCl(1) Na2SeO3 + InCl3 → In2(SeO3)3 + NaCl(2) CuSeO3 + In2(SeO3)3 → CuInSe2O5 + by-products(3) (4) (5)
Both intermediate products, CuSeO3 and In2(SeO3)3, were amorphous.34 No characteristic peaks of other impurities, such as Se or Cu2Se, were detected in the XRD pattern. Under these hydrothermal synthesis conditions, the water was used as a reducing agent34 to release Cu+ and Se2− as ethanol reduces Cu2+ to Cu+.35 Moreover, it may be easier to reduce CuSeO3 compared to In2(SeO3)3.34 From the EDX and ICP data (in Table 1 & 2), the stoichiometric composition of Cu, In and Se in the as-prepared amorphous precursor compounds was 1:1:2. This result suggests that the final precursor compounds were diselenite, as seen in step 3. The as-prepared amorphous precursor compounds were then transformed to crystalline CuInSe2 (step 4 & 5).
4. Conclusions
In this study, we have shown that a uniform structure for amorphous precursor compounds can be successfully synthesized by a microwave enhanced process in aqueous solution at a pH of 5 at 180 °C for 30 min, which is a great improvement on reducing the reaction time and temperature. Pure chalcopyrite CuInSe2 particles with a better stoichiometry are attainable by post reduction of the amorphous precursor compounds with selenium powder in an atmosphere of 2% H2 and 98% Ar at 500 °C for 3 h. The morphological and compositional features of the amorphous precursor compounds and CuInSe2 particles were characterized by XRD, SEM, and EDX elemental analysis. The CuInSe2 particles prepared by the proposed microwave assisted method followed by reduction give an ideal stoichiometry and purity. This microwave assisted hydrothermal method proves to be a convenient way to control the morphology and crystallinity of the products. The obtained amorphous compound was demonstrated to fabricate a uniform CuInSe2 thin film for solar cell applications by electrophoretic deposition. Overall, the integrated concept of formulating a precursor with a designated composition and then following with reduction and deposition processes offers a viable, simplified and economical option to the current dry processes. Using the as-prepared amorphous compound as a precursor for the preparation of CuInSe2 films or powders, it gives better control over the crystallinity of CuInSe2, via manipulating the deposition and reduction parameters, than a one-step production CuInSe2 crystal. Although the concentration of the reactants and reduction temperature are supposed to be responsible for the formation of the amorphous compound and its transformation to crystalline CuInSe2 respectively, further investigation on the formation mechanism of the amorphous compound and its transformation to crystalline CuInSe2 is underway. This optimized approach can also be applied to other similar materials and their industrial applications.
