    , Accepted 4th August 2016First published on 8th August 2016AbstractThis paper describes a model to simulate changes in the size distribution of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) in TiO2 films upon continuous wave light excitation. Interrelated laser induced physical and chemical processes initiated directly by photon absorption or by plasmon induced thermal heating are considered. Namely the model takes into account the NP coalescence, Ostwald ripening, the reduction of silver ions and the oxidation of metallic NPs, competitive mechanisms that can lead to counter-intuitive behaviors depending on the exposure conditions. Theoretical predictions are compared successfully to the experimental results deduced from a thorough analysis of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) pictures of Ag:TiO2 films processed with a scanning visible laser beam at different speeds. Ag:TiO2 systems are considered for many applications in solar energy conversion, photocatalysis or secured data printing. Numerical investigations of such a system provide a better understanding of light induced growth and shrinking processes and open up prospects for designing more efficient photocatalytic devices based on metal NP doped TiO2 or for improving the size homogeneity in self-organized metallic NP patterns, for instance.
Introduction
During the past few decades, metallic nanoparticle (NP) based applications have been largely developed in many domains thanks to their localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs), which provide an efficient platform for local electromagnetic field enhancements, and heat or charge transfers via hot electron generation.1–3 Performances of these applications strongly depend on the NP characteristics such as the size, shape, distribution and on their environment. Top-down techniques like electron-beam or dip-pen lithography provide a precise control of these characteristics but they are time-consuming, expensive and not suited to produce NPs over large areas.4,5 Bottom-up approaches, where metallic NPs form by a growth process, can provide well-controlled features of NPs but not necessarily organized patterns, especially when the NPs are grown in a solid host matrix.6–9 Recently, different self-organization mechanisms have been implemented to grow organized NP patterns; the related processes have the advantage to be cost-effective, easy to implement and well-suited to large surface patterning.10–12 These processes often result from complex interactions and various physicochemical mechanisms promoted by photons or heat. Then it appears critical for researchers to investigate experimentally and theoretically the different mechanisms involved in NP formation for a better control of their morphology and organization, in order to improve the efficiency of plasmonic applications.
Here, we consider laser induced mechanisms that lead to the generation of metallic NPs in a TiO2 host matrix. Photon absorption directly leads to electron excitation, which can result in charge transfers between nanoparticles and their host matrix or in thermal heating.1 The latter promotes chemical reactions, matter diffusion, phase changes or matter reorganization. Charge transfers from the NPs to the host matrix lead to NP oxidation. All these mechanisms finally control the size distribution of metallic NPs that we aim to calculate. In this paper we specifically consider the case of silver NPs embedded in a TiO2 film and excited in their plasmon resonance band using a scanning continuous wave (cw) visible laser beam. Ag-NP:TiO2 systems are largely used for applications in fields like solar energy harvesting, photocatalysis-based air pollution control, or secured data printing, for instance. We also recently demonstrated that self-organization mechanisms occur in such systems,13 providing very singular dichroic color printing on transparent support.14 In this process, the morphological features of NPs depend on the laser beam characteristics. For a fixed pair of laser power and beam width, the speed at which the laser scans the sample surface appears to be a crucial parameter to control the final NP size and organization: Ag NPs shrink at a low scanning speed, whereas growth and self-organization occur above a speed threshold. In order to explain such a counter-intuitive behavior we had previously developed a semi-phenomenological theoretical model where different physicochemical mechanisms were considered.15 This model predicted the size decrease or increase observed on either side of the speed threshold as a result of a tunable competition between growth and oxidation mechanisms, controlled by the temporal profile of the incident laser intensity. Growth mechanisms, including silver ion reduction and Ostwald ripening, are thermally activated while oxidation is proportional to the number of absorbed photons. The theoretical results predicting the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters on the speed threshold value were very consistent with the experimental ones. However, this former model considers only a monodisperse NP size distribution, which prevents from the correct simulation of the NP size distribution as obtained experimentally. The improved model developed in the present paper takes into account poly-disperse NP size distributions and coalescence phenomena9 in order to properly describe the changes in the NP size distribution during the laser process.
This approach relies on solving a system of coupled nonlinear equations derived from different physical and chemical processes accounting for the NP size variation under light exposure, and for which different modeling schemes have already been proposed. Population balance models are largely used to solve the particle size distribution (PSD) problem involving simultaneously particle coalescence and growth by monomers (Ostwald ripening). PSD is usually described by its number density function n(x,t) which corresponds to the quantity of NPs of volume x per unit volume at time t. The latter yields the NP volume concentration N(t) by . The general form of the Population Balance Equation (PBE) for a well-mixed closed system is ref. 16 and 17 (1)where the temporal variation of the number density function n(x,t) is given by the difference between the particle birth rate B and death rate D together with the influence of the growth kinetics G calculated from the Ostwald ripening mechanism when a monomer adds to a NP. Both statistical and deterministic type methods can be used for solving this PBE. In statistical methods, the PBE is usually solved using the Monte Carlo technique.18,19 At each time step, one target particle is randomly chosen from the distribution and the particle growth event occurs only with a certain probability calculated according to its physical origin. The advantages of Monte Carlo methods are the possibility to track each particle with its spatial information and the simplicity of their numerical implementation. However, getting accurate results requires an important particle quantity to be considered, which may finally make such an approach highly time-consuming. Furthermore, statistical methods usually fail to converge to accurate results for long processes, and including additional contributions (like chemical reactions) appears to be hardly achievable. In deterministic methods, the considered size range is usually discretized into adjacent sections, and PBEs are thus reformulated for each section to trace the particle distribution temporal evolution.16,20–22 Deterministic methods can be quite accurate for both the particle distribution moments (1st and 2nd moments correspond to the total and average volumes of the particle distribution, respectively) and the particle distribution shape. Moreover, thanks to the integro-differential form of the PBE, deterministic methods can be easily blended with other processes. Computing accuracy and time strongly depend on the chosen numerical techniques for solving the PBE. The numerical scheme needs therefore to be carefully chosen according to the simulated problem. In our case, the silver NP growth process is very sharp in time and the number density function n(x,t) can rapidly shift over several orders of magnitude, which lead to choose a robust and accurate simulation model. Moreover, chemical reactions such as silver ion reduction and NP photo-oxidation strongly influence the final NP size distribution and must be considered. For these reasons, we have chosen to implement a deterministic method with a “cell average” technique, which provides a good compromise between the computation time and the accuracy.21
This paper starts with a review of different physicochemical processes involved in our model and gives their analytical expressions in PBE. We successively introduce the thermally activated NP coalescence, Ostwald Ripening, silver ion reduction and NP photo-oxidation, which occur simultaneously under laser exposure in a silver NP containing titania film. All these processes are driven by the number of absorbed photons and by the temperature reached in the film. This model also includes the calculation of the film optical absorption through the plasmonic absorption of the NP distribution, thermal heating, conduction phenomena, and ionic and atomic diffusion. A matter flow scheme is presented to clarify the link between these processes and well identify the thermally activated growth mechanisms and the photon activated shrinkage mechanisms. Theoretical predictions are finally compared to the experimental results deduced from a thorough analysis of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) pictures of samples processed with increasing scanning speeds of the laser beam. The objective of this comparison is to legitimate the model consistency.
Simulation model
Nanoparticle coalescence
Nanoparticle coalescence has been observed in many metallic NP systems.9,23,24 In our work, the numerical approach used to treat the particle coalescence is related to the “cell average” technique.21 The considered nanoparticle volume range [xmin, xmax] is discretized into M small adjacent sections, named by “cell”, where the ith cell is limited by its lower and upper boundaries denoted by xi−1/2 and xi+1/2 as shown in Fig. 1(a). We have thus xmin = x1/2 and xmax = xM+1/2. In the current work, only coalescence of two particles is considered, which creates both birth events at the newborn particles' cell, and death events at the parent particles' cells. A new population balance equation can then be rewritten for each cell: (2)where Ni is the volume concentration of the nanoparticles within the ith cell, Btoti and Dtoti are, respectively, the total particle birth event rate and the death event rate in the ith cell.
 Fig. 1  (a) Before and (b) after split and reassignment of the newborn NPs (red bars) stemming from the coalescence process. Blue bars represent the current NP quantity at each cell center. Red bars correspond to newborn particles that are affected to the center of adjacent cells proportionally to the relative position of the newborn particle average volume between the neighboring cell centers. 
In order to express Btoti and Dtoti, one can assume that particles are only present at the center xi of each cell, whose value is xi = (xi−1/2 + xi+1/2)/2. According to Kumar et al.21 the total birth events taking place within each cell per unit time can be calculated by: (3)where βm,n is the coalescence kernel for a couple of particles of volumes xm and xn. δm,n is the Kronecker function. The mathematical form of βm,n depends on the physical origin of the NP coalescence and will be detailed later for the studied case. Nm is the volume concentration of particles of volume xm. The term βm,nNmNn gives the coalescence rate per unit volume of the particle pair of volumes xm and xn. The sum operator takes over all particle pairs whose total volume is within the ith cell range. From (3), the average volume vi of these newborn particles in each cell can be deduced as: (4)
If this average volume locates at a cell center, the whole quantity of the newborn particles in this cell can be assigned to it. However, when the average volume locates between two neighboring centers, the newborn particles must be split into two parts and reassigned to the two closest centers as illustrated in Fig. 1. In the case of the ith cell of Fig. 1, for an average volume of newborn particles that falls in the upper half part of the cell, let al and au be the fractions of the newborn particles to be reassigned to lower and upper closest centers xi and xi+1. In order to have quantity and volume conserved during particle splitting processes, al and au must satisfy the conditions below: au + al = Bi(5) auxi+1 + alxi = Bivi(6)which give, au = Biλ−i+1(vi)(7) al = Biλ+i(vi)(8)with (9)
When the average volume falls in the lower half-part of the cell (vi+1 of the (i + 1)th cell in Fig. 1), one has similarly: au = Bi+1λ−i+1(vi+1) and al = Bi+1λ+i(vi+1). So as in eqn (7)–(9), the index of B and v is the index of the cell where the newborn particles are created while the index of λ is that of the cell where the newborn particles are affected after splitting, and the sign + or − is, respectively, for “l” and “u”.
One cell may receive the birth contribution from both its lower and upper neighbors together with its own contribution. The total birth event term in one cell can be written as: Btoti = Bi−1λ−i(vi−1)H(vi−1 − xi−1) + Biλ−i(vi)H(xi − vi) + Biλ+i(vi)H(vi − xi) + Bi+1λ+i(vi+1)H(xi+1 − vi+1)(10)where H(x) is the Heaviside step function whose value is zero for the negative argument, one for the positive argument and 0.5 for H(0).
In each cell, the death event is only produced by the coalescence of its local particles with the particles in other cells and it takes the form: (11)Substituting (10) and (11) in (2), the final set of PBEs for the coalescence process is given by (12)
The coalescence kernel βm,n is chosen here as a Brownian kernel, for the following two reasons. Firstly, the silver nanoparticle coalescence process is identified as a diffusion-controlled process and the Brownian kernel is generally accepted in this case.25 The reason for this is that the nanoparticle growth in our samples is assisted by a local heating up to 700–1300 K due to plasmon absorption15 and at such temperatures, the sintering of a metal or semiconductor aggregate into a spherical form was reported to occur in the nanosecond or even picosecond range.26,27 Such times are shorter than the average particle collision time calculated in our case. Secondly, the diffusion of bulk atoms and NP coalescence are activated only above the Tammann temperature,28 which is usually the half of the melting point. In the case of metallic NPs, the melting point is found to depend on the particle size.29 The same dependence can be found by the analytical form of the NP Brownian diffusion coefficient DNP, given by the Stokes–Einstein equation: (13)where R is the gas constant, Ev is the activation energy, c is a constant pre-exponential factor, rnp is the radius of the spherical particle, kB the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute temperature. DNP depends on the Arrhenius-type viscosity ηv:30 (14)The analytical form of the Brownian kernel for particle pairs (m, n) can be written as ref. 18 (15)where rm and rn are, respectively, the average radius of NPs in the mth and nth cells. Under the assumption of spherical NPs, NP radius r and volume x satisfy (16). (16)
Nanoparticle growth by Ostwald ripening
In parallel with NP coalescence, the NP size can also be modified by the absorption or the dissolution of monomers,9,31 which are silver atoms (Ag0) in our case. According to our previous work,15 the quantity (noted Gwt) of Ag0 adsorbed by one NP of radius r per unit time under the Ostwald Ripening process can be formulated as: Gwt = 4πr2JAg0(17)where JAg0 is the local flow of silver atoms from the external of NPs of radius r to their surface, whose analytical form can be written as: (18)where DAg0 is the temperature-dependent diffusion coefficient of silver atoms, CAg0 is the Ag0 concentration at the macroscopic scale and cr is the local silver atom concentration around one NP, given by: (19)with S the silver atom solubility, ω the atomic volume of silver and γ the Ag NP/TiO2 matrix interface tension.
According to the Ostwald ripening theory,32 the growth of large NPs is based on the shrinkage of small NPs. For small enough NPs, JAg0 can be negative and silver atoms flow out of NPs. In this case, NPs shrink and the global Ag0 concentration increases. In contrast, for large NPs, JAg0 is positive and NPs grow by adsorbing silver atoms, which can come from small NPs.
Using the same volume based discretization as the previous “cell average” technique, the Ostwald ripening process at each cell center and cell boundary is given by (20) (21)where ri and ri+1/2, deduced from xi and xi+1/2 by (16), are the radii of NPs located at the ith cell center and its upper boundary, respectively. One can thus combine the Ostwald ripening process with the “cell average” NP coalescence scheme by solving simultaneously the ordinary differential equation (ODE) set (12), (20) and (21). This approach, named the “Lagrangian technique” by Kumar et al.21 was evaluated as a computational costly strategy. Nevertheless, compared to the other “efficient” techniques such as the “cell average” one for surface growth21 and the finite volume scheme,22 it is still the best method to combine these two processes thanks to its better precision for the stiff NP growth/shrinkage process, which was observed previously in our samples.15 As well, the silver atom concentration variation due to Ostwald ripening can be formulated as: (22)
Nanoparticle photo-oxidation and silver ion reduction
Chemical reactions also control the growth of silver NPs. The latter oxidize and shrink under visible illumination due to the excitation of hot electrons through the LSPR and their transfer to the conduction band of TiO2 through the Schottky junction formed at the TiO2/Ag interface.1,33,34 The number of oxidized atoms per NP and per unit time, Oxy, can be written as: (23)where I is the instantaneous laser intensity, σr is the absorption cross-section of silver NPs of radius r calculated using the Mie theory, h is the Planck constant and finc is the incident light frequency. The term Iσr/hfinc gives the number of absorbed photons by a single NP of radius r per unit time and ηion is the ionization quantum efficiency of silver NPs.
In a similar way to that for Ostwald Ripening in eqn (20)–(22), one can rewrite here the variation rate of the NP volume at each cell center/boundary and the variation rate of the silver ion concentration due to photo-oxidation as: (24) (25) (26)
Reversely and simultaneously, silver ions present in the system can be reduced due to the laser induced heating. It can be noted that in our samples, about two-thirds of silver are in the form of ions in the initial state. According to Kaganovskii et al.7 the number of reduced atoms per unit volume per unit time is formulated as: (27)which corresponds also to the quantity of lost silver ions, due to reduction.
In this equation, p and Dred are, respectively, the reduction probability and the reducing agent diffusion coefficient, which both follow an Arrhenius law. Cred is the concentration of the reducing agent and CAg+ is the silver ion concentration. The reducing agent is not clearly identified in our composite system. It may be H2 in the atmosphere, TiO2 itself at high temperature, or even chemical compounds from the glass substrate.
Final ODE set
At this stage, it is important to summarize the physicochemical reactions and deduce the final ODE set to be solved. In our system, silver is present in three forms: silver ions (Ag+), silver atoms (Ag0) and silver NPs. The matter flows between these species are shown in Fig. 2. The photo-oxidation transfers silver from the NP form to the ionic form and leads to the NP shrinkage. This shrinkage process is controlled by the incident laser beam intensity. In the meanwhile, the reduction of silver ions provides firstly the source material for the NP growth, which is then produced by the double effect of Ostwald ripening and NP coalescence. This NP growth process is driven by the instantaneous local temperature in the system. According to (22), (26) and (27), the variation rate of the silver atom concentration and the silver ion concentration can be written as: (28) (29)
 Fig. 2  Sketch of matter flows between the different Ag species in the studied system. These flows are driven by physicochemical processes which lead to the NP growth (red arrows) or shrinkage (green arrows). 
The NP growth process is formulated by the “cell average” NP coalescence scheme in (12) together with the volume variation rate of each cell center and the boundary in (30) and (31), deduced from (20), (21), (24) and (25). In order to reduce the stiff level of the ODE system, one can also simulate the radius variation rate, under the assumption of spherical NPs, of the cell center/boundary, as given by (32) and (33) instead of (30) and (31). (30) (31) (32) (33)

Eqn (12), (28), (29), (32) and (33) give the final ODE set of order 3M + 3 for our NP growth problem.
Simulation parameters
The initial NP size distribution was reconstructed from the processing of tens of STEM-HAADF images acquired on initial samples (Fig. 3(a) shows a STEM-HAADF micrograph of the initial sample and Fig. 4(a) the NP size distribution). By fitting the experimental data (red curve in Fig. 4(a)), the initial NP volume density of each cell N0i is expressed as (34)where N0 = 1.69 × 1024 m3, c0 = 0.8 nm and c1 = 0.75 nm. When 2r − c0 is negative, N0i is chosen to be zero. The initial Ag0 concentration was chosen at 1.5 × 1025 m−3 so that the Ostwald ripening kinetic is almost zero for the initial NP size distribution without any light excitation. This means that the Ag0 flow in (18) for a NP radius equal to the mean radius of the initial NP size distribution is almost zero. According to the Ag/Ti atom quantity ratio deduced from Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) measurements on the Ag:TiO2 sample and the Ti atom concentration estimated from the geometric features of the TiO2 mesoporous matrix, the total silver concentration in the sample is estimated to be around 3 × 1027 m−3. Subtracting the silver atoms present in NPs and in the form of Ag0 from this total silver concentration, the silver ion concentration was estimated to be around 2 × 1027 m−3 in this work.

As shown previously in (15), (18) and (27), NP growth is a temperature driven process. In this work, the local temperature rise is calculated upon a two layer structure which consists of a composite Ag:TiO2 layer supported by a glass substrate.35 During the simulation, the temperature is updated at each ODE solver time step, which depends on the absorption coefficient of the film α, calculated from the NP absorption cross-section σri of each cell and the NP concentration Ni as (35)Most of the other simulation parameters are chosen according to our previous studies15 and they are presented in Table 1, except the activation energy Ev and constant c in (14) for the viscosity of silver NPs in the TiO2 matrix. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have been reported on parameters Ev and c of similar Ag:TiO2 systems. Martínez et al.9 show that the growth kinetic energy of Au particles in the TiO2 matrix is 49 kJ mol−1 within the temperature range where both Oswald ripening growth and coalescence may occur. This growth kinetic energy varies from 12 kJ mol−1 to 120 kJ mol−1 in the same Au:TiO2 system under different atmosphere conditions.36,37 In the case of Ag NPs containing glass,38 the activation energy of viscosity was reported to be around 86 kJ mol−1. As a result we consider the parameter range [10 kJ mol−1, 120 kJ mol−1] as reasonable for Ev in our simulations. c is considered as a proportionality coefficient to be fitted by comparison with the experimental results.

At the initial state, the studied volume range is discretized into 100 adjacent cells with cell boundaries given by a geometric law:  which is well adapted for the size distribution varying over several orders of magnitude. xmin is chosen as 6.5 × 10−29 m3 for an equivalent rmin of 0.2 nm that corresponds to the size of one silver crystal cell. Shrinking below this volume, the NP is considered as a dead NP and its size cannot be modified anymore. An ODE set of order 303 can be established by (12), (28), (29), (32) and (33). The numerical system is programmed using Python3 and the ODE set is solved using the ISODA stiff problem solver in the SciPy open source package for the best compromise between the calculation accuracy and the duration.
Experimental validation and discussion
In order to check the consistency of the elaborated model, theoretical simulations have been compared to the experimental results. Experiments have been carried out on mesoporous films of amorphous TiO2 loaded with silver salt elaborated by a sol–gel process reported in previous studies.13,14,39,40 Before being exposed to visible laser light, samples were illuminated with UV light (400 μW cm−2 at 254 nm wavelength) for 30 min. This pre-treatment allows reducing roughly one-third of the silver salt and leads to the formation of small Ag NPs as shown in Fig. 4(a). We experimentally study the NP growth under laser exposure at 488 nm as a function of the scanning speed using fixed power (90 mW) and beam diameter (12 μm at 1/e2 in intensity). Initial and laser processed samples were characterized by High Angular Annular Dark Field STEM (HAADF-STEM) imaging (Fig. 3) using a JEOL 2010F TEM. NP size distributions, shown in Fig. 4, were calculated from the corresponding HAADF-STEM images in Fig. 3 using a well suited image processing algorithm. The vertical axis of the size histograms represents Nnp/Δd where Nnp is the volume density of NPs in m−3 and Δd is the bar width in nm. In this way, the histogram height is independent of the bar width and the total area of bars in one histogram represents the NP volume density.
As is observed previously,13,15 for a fixed laser power and beam width, a speed threshold, noted Vt, can be identified which separates two regimes in which the NP growth or the NP shrinkage predominates, respectively. In the present experiments, Vt = 300 ± 50 μm s−1. The model provides a prediction of the NP size distribution and we focus our study on the changes that occur in the final size histograms considering various scanning speeds. Below the threshold Vt (Fig. 3(b) and 4(b)) the size histogram narrows and shifts towards lower sizes. Above the threshold (Fig. 3(c–f) and 4(c–f)), several interesting features are observed and detailed below.
We can note in Fig. 3(c–f) that the grown NPs are self-organized in parallel lines. This phenomenon, which was reported in ref. 13 and the results from an optical interference phenomenon that falls into place within the film due to the excitation of a guided mode in the TiO2 film, is not yet considered in our model. The latter only considers a Gaussian shape intensity whose time variations depend on the scanning speed and simulate the NP growth without any account of the spatial distribution of NPs. So, considering only the size variations, two regimes can be observed above Vt regarding the morphological features of the grown NPs. The first one, illustrated in Fig. 3(c), is located between Vt and Vt +150 μm s−1. NPs form irregular aggregates with a high spatial density. Without knowing precisely the exact form of each NP, the size distribution in this case is estimated by the average of the long axis and the short axis of the aggregate top view. The NPs are grown to an average size between 10 nm and 12 nm, which is about 10 times bigger than the initial average size. The second regime is from Vt +150 μm s−1 to about Vt +1200 μm s−1, le latter being the speed above which the NP organization disappears. In this speed range, large spherical NPs with a lower density are produced. At speed Vt +150 μm s−1 (Fig. 3(d) and 4(d)) two classes of NPs whose mean sizes are, respectively, around 15 nm and 90 nm, emerge. At increasing speed (Fig. 3(e and f)), the grown NPs keep similar form and size characteristics but the location of the two peaks in the size histograms gets closer. At Vt +500 μm s−1, the shift to a higher size of the small NP peak corresponds to a diminution of the NP quantity around 20 nm and to an increase around 45 nm. The same kind of right shift is more pronounced for Vt +1200 μm s−1. HAADF-STEM images also reveal the progressive disappearance of small NPs and the emergence of medium size NPs. In the meanwhile, the mean value of the higher size peak is slightly shifted to a lower size when the speed increases.
Simulations, shown in Fig. 4, have been performed with the same laser parameters as the experimental ones and considering the initial NP size distribution fitted from the experimental results (Fig. 4(a)). These theoretical predictions give a speed threshold equal to the experimental one to within the accuracy of measurements. The shape of the simulated NP size distribution evolves in the same manner as the experimental one. The size distribution narrows and shifts towards lower sizes below the speed threshold and, at speed Vt +50 μm s−1 (Fig. 4(c)), NPs grow to an average size of 15 nm, which is quite close to the experimental observations. From Vt +150 μm s−1, histograms are characterized by two main peaks whose distance decreases when the speed increases, and whose positions are in the same size ranges as the experimental ones. Changes in the NP density are also very consistent with the experimental values as can be observed in the histograms.
The theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental ones regarding the size ranges, the NP volume density and the presence of one or two populations in the NP size distributions. The model appears therefore quite reliable by considering four equations that take into account the main mechanisms at the origin of changes in the NP size. The non-perfect matching of the shape of simulated and experimental histograms is likely to come from the model limitations. Phase changes in the host matrix and collapse of the film porosity that occur during laser exposure are neglected. The latter induce changes in the optical, thermal and chemical parameters of the Ag:TiO2 composite film during the laser process. However, all these parameters are kept constant during simulations in order to maintain the simplicity of the model. Note that choosing different sets of parameters in a large reasonable range does not influence so much the evolution of the NP size histograms as a function of speed. We also approximate that NPs homogeneously and randomly distribute over the film without considering the changes in the local NP density due to the self-organization. According to these approximations, the agreement between the experimental and numerical results is really convincing.
Additionally, in order to show that the growth kinetics is well governed by a combination of the described mechanisms, we have calculated what would happen if one of these mechanisms was removed. Fig. 5 shows the best simulation results obtained by neglecting the NP coalescence (Fig. 5(a)–(c)) or the Ostwald ripening growth (Fig. 5(d)–(f)). Narrower histograms are found in all cases, with two close peaks when coalescence is neglected or a single peak when Ostwald ripening is neglected. The size range at a low speed above the threshold is always larger than the experimental one whereas the size of large NPs at a higher speed is always underestimated. The changes in the simulated NP density are also now significantly different from the experimental measurements. This confirms that both Ostwald ripening and coalescence processes significantly contribute to the laser-induced growth mechanisms in such systems.

Conclusions
This paper describes a model to simulate the changes in the size distribution of silver NPs induced by visible light in a TiO2 matrix. The model takes into account the collective contribution of various physicochemical processes that are Ostwald ripening, NP coalescence, NP photo-oxidation and silver ion reduction. Photo-oxidation leads to the NP shrinkage and counterbalances growth mechanisms that occur either through the absorption of silver atoms (Ostwald ripening and silver ion reduction) or the NP coalescence. Simulations were carried out considering a cw laser emitting in the visible range and scanning the sample surface; they are in good agreement with experimental observations and reveal the significant influence of each process involved. Considering the size distribution of nanoparticles gives access to the realistic results that make the description of the system evolution quite reliable. Such a model can be applied to better predict the size evolution of metallic NPs in TiO2 based systems used for photocatalysis and estimate changes in their efficiency. It is also a starting point to simulate self-organization mechanisms of metallic NPs upon laser exposure. Furthermore, the numerical approach and physical formulation that have been presented for each involved physicochemical process give the possibility to apply or extend the NP growth model to the other similar systems such as NP suspensions in liquids or NPs supported on surfaces.
