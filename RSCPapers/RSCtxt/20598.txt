    , Accepted 29th December 2015First published on 30th December 2015AbstractA novel solvent-thermal Y2O3 template method was explored to synthesise NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ inverse opal photonic crystals (IOPCs), which show highly improved up-conversion luminescence properties.
Up-conversion luminescence (UCL) which converts two or more near infrared (NIR) photons to one visible or UV photon could be useful for various technological applications such as solar cells, short wavelength solid state lasers, optical data storage, infrared photocatalysis, infrared-responsive devices, biological fluorescence labels and white light emitters.1 Among the various UC materials, inorganic compounds doped with trivalent rare-earth (RE) ions have emerged as the most promising media due to the ladder-like 4f energy levels, which are superior in many aspects such as multiple emissions, controllable and narrow emission bands, higher conversion efficiency, better photostability and chemical durability.2 Fluoride has been demonstrated to be a promising host material for UCL because of its low phonon energy. However, the lower UCL efficiency is still a bottleneck problem for various applications. At present, various methods have been explored to improve the UC strengths.3 Exploration of more strategies to enhance UCL processes would be the profound significance.
On the other hand, since the concept of photonic crystals (PhCs) was first mentioned by Yablonovitch4 and John5 in 1987, these special structures have attracted considerable attention in the fields of near-zero threshold lasers, sensors, waveguides, PhC fibers, etc.6 In recent years, the modulations of IOPC structures on the UCL properties of RE-ions were also widely studied.7 However, only a few prepared fluoride (NaYF4) based IOPC composites by the direct template method due to preparation difficulties.8 It is necessary to develop novel methods to prepare fluoride IOPCs and fully understand the effects of the PhC structure on the UCL processes of RE-ions in the fluorides with lower phonon energy.
In this work, NaYF4 IOPCs were successfully prepared through a novel solvent-thermal Y2O3 IOPC template method and the phase of NaYF4:Tm3+/Er3+ and the photonic band gap (PBG) of IOPCs could be adjusted by the pH value, reaction time and template. Subsequently, the UCL properties and dynamics were systematically studied and the results show that the IOPC structure is conductive to UCL, especially for high-order UC processes. And moreover, the NIR photoelectric response was observed in the NaYF4:Yb,Tm IOPC/TiO2 system, indicating that this special material has a good application prospect in the field of photocatalyses and photoelectrochemistry.

Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic of fabrication processes of NaYF4 IOPCs, and the detailed description is shown in the ESI.† The SEM images of the PMMA opal template, the Y2O3 IOPC template and NaYF4 IOPC are shown in Fig. 1(b)–(d), which demonstrate a high degree of ordered PhC structure of face-centered-cubic (FCC) arrays. Note that the center-to-center distance of NaYF4 IOPC is the same as the Y2O3 IOPC template, indicating that the solvent-thermal process has occurred around the IOPC skeleton and did not destroy the IOPC structure. Fig. 1(e) shows the TEM image of NaYF4 IOPC, which shows an ordered empty cavity structure consisting of NaYF4 walls and further indicates the well-ordered IOPC structure.

In the solvent-thermal process, the pH value is an important parameter which directly affects the phase and the structure of NaYF4 IOPCs. The temperature and the reaction time are controlled to be 180 °C and 2 h, and the pH value is adjusted to be 1, 4, 7, 8, 9 and 10 with nitric acid or ammonia, respectively. When the pH value is less than 7, the Y2O3 IOPC skeleton is completely dissolved away under the action of a large amount of H+; when the pH value is equal to or larger than 7, the IOPC structure could be better inherited. As shown in Fig. 2, under the neutral conditions, the hexagonal is dominant. With the increasing pH value, the hexagonal phase becomes weak and the cubic phase becomes strong gradually and when the pH value reaches 10, pure cubic phase NaYF4 IOPCs are formed. In addition to the pH value, the reaction time is another important parameter, which has a great impact on the location of PBG and the details can be seen in Fig. S1 (ESI†).

Fig. 3(a) shows the steady-state emission spectra (980 nm, 0.33 W mm−2) and the transmittance spectra at normal (θ = 0°) of NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ IOPCs with PBGs at 405 nm (PhC1) and 472 nm (PhC2). Note that PHC1 and PHC2 were obtained by controlling the size of PMMA spheres, and the hydrothermal reaction times were both fixed at 3 h. It can be seen that while the PBG overlaps with the 1G4–3H6 and 1D2–3H6 transition of Tm3+ (PhC2), a significant inhibition of luminescence intensity can be observed in contrast to PhC1. This is due to the reduction in the number of optical modes available for photon propagation at frequencies within the PBGs. The inhibition of light emission is a universal phenomenon for luminescent species embedded in PhCs. Noted that the luminescence dynamic processes are not modified by the PBG effect (see Fig. S2, ESI†) and this phenomenon is similar to our previous studies.9

For the Ref sample, the down-conversion NIR luminescence intensity is absolutely predominant (93.01%), while that is only 32.34% in the PhC sample. Surprisingly, the percentage of visible UCL improves from 5.29% of the Ref to 38.91% of the IOPC, while UV light improves from 1.7% to 28.75%. In one word, the UCL processes, especially the high-order processes in the IOPC sample, have been greatly improved in contrast to the Ref sample.
In order to reveal the mechanism of UCL, the double-logarithmic plots of the UCL intensity of different transitions were plotted as a function of excitation power density under 980 nm excitation, as shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the slopes n of 4H9/2–4I15/2, 2H11/2/4H13/2–4I15/2+, and 4F9/2–4I15/2 in NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ IOPCs were larger than those in Ref samples. In addition, with the increasing excitation power density, the slopes of the Ref sample gradually decreased, which was mainly attributed to the improved saturation effect and the local thermal effect induced by laser exposure, but the slopes of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ IOPCs changed a little. This is the reason that the IOPC structure could suppress the local thermal effect.

Based on the virtual cavity model,10 the radiative transition rate WR can be approximatively expressed as: (1)where f(ED) is the electric dipole strength, λ0 is the wavelength in a vacuum, and neff is the effective refractive index. Through calculations, neff in IOPC (neff = 1.25) is less than neff in Ref (neff = 1.72), so WR in IOPC should be less than that in the Ref based on eqn (1). Note that under the excitation of the 980 nm light with the same power density, the IOPC sample has a lower temperature increase (see Fig. S3, ESI†). This also indicates that the IOPC structure can suppress the local thermal effect induced by laser irradiation, which is attributed to its better thermal diffusion properties due to the empty cavity structure. So it can be concluded that the nonradiative relaxation rate WNR in IOPC should be also less than that in Ref because of the increased phonon density, which depends strongly on temperature. The lower WR(PhC) and WNR(PhC) lead to longer intermediate state lifetime, making electrons transit into the higher energy level more easily.
UCL dynamics are a powerful method to understand the microscopic processes. In order to better understand the UCL properties of NaYF4 IOPCs, the luminescence dynamic processes of 1D2–3H6, 1G4–3H6, 3H4–3F6 and 3F4–3H6 were investigated and are shown in the upper right of Fig. 5. As shown, the lifetimes of 1D2–3H6 and 1G4–3H6 in the IOPC sample are prolonged 25% and 27% compared to the Ref sample, respectively. Instead, the lifetime of 3H4–3F4 is similar but that of 3F4–3H4 becomes smaller. As is well known, the lifetime of one luminescence state is reciprocal to radiative transition rates plus nonradiative relaxation rates. Normally, the nonradiative processes only occur from the excited energy level to the nearest down energy level. However, in the UCL system, the electron in the excited energy level can absorb a photon and transit into a higher energy level, which is also a nonradiative process. So the lifetime τ can be expressed as: (2)where WR is the radiative transition rate, WNR is the nonradiative relaxation rate and WUP is the up-conversion transition rate. WR(PhC) becomes small due to the modulations of the effective refractive index and WNR(PhC) also turns small because the local temperature is lower in contrast to powder samples (this can be deduced by the ratio of green light intensity of Er3+ ions and seen in Fig. S3, ESI†). Note that, the inhibition of local temperature also restrains the nonradiative processes of Yb3+ ions, making the energy transition from Yb3+ to Tm3+ much easier.11 As is well known, lifetime plays an important role in UC processes and the long lifetime conduces to UCL. Based on eqn (2), for the 3F4 energy level, WUP(PhC) changes significantly and plays a dominant role (lifetime is long enough), so the lifetime of 3F4–3H4 becomes smaller; and for 1D2 and 1G4, WUP(PhC) changes weakly (lifetime is short), so the lifetime of 1D4–3H6 and 1G4–3H6 is prolonged.

The energy gap of the anatase TiO2 structure is about 3.2 eV, a UC photon with enough energy (UV UCL of 1D2–3H6 and 1I6–3I5) can be absorbed by TiO2 and generates a photoelectron. Fig. 6(a) shows the schematic diagram of the NaYF4/TiO2 NIR photoelectric response system. Note that in the system, a 2 mm gap in the middle of FTO was etched by hydrochloric acid, then a polycrystalline anatase TiO2 film was grown by magnetron sputtering and then NaYF4 IOPC was adhered to the TiO2 film. The photocurrent was measured using a source meter with a voltage of 5 V under the irradiation of a 980 nm continuous laser. Each test point was measured 40 times. The average values and the error bars are shown in Fig. 6(b). A ∼9 μA dark current was measured without irradiation and the current became stronger when the power density was up to 0.3 W mm−2, which was corresponding to the UCL threshold of NaYF4:Yb,Tm IOPCs. The current finally enhanced 12% when the power density reached 1.25 W mm−2. In order to exclude the influence of the local thermal effect, the situation without Tm3+ doping was considered and the current was enhanced only 3.8% at 1.25 W mm−2, implying that the NIR to UV UCL played a dominant role in the improvement of photocurrent with excitation power in NaYF4:Yb,Tm IOPC/TiO2 composites. Actually, we used the corresponding ground powder of IOPC adhered on the TiO2 film with the same quantity to measure the photocurrent. But the photocurrent was too weak to detect the dark current, showing that the netware structure of IOPCs is helpful for electron transport.

Conclusions
In summary, NaYF4 IOPCs were successfully prepared through a novel solvent-thermal Y2O3 template method and the phase of NaYF4 and the PBG of IOPCs could be adjusted by the pH value, reaction time and the template. It is significant to observe that NaYF4:Tm3+/Er3+,Yb3+ IOPCs showed an extraordinarily improved UCL ratio in contrast to the Ref. And moreover, the NIR photoelectric response was observed in the NaYF4:Yb,Tm IOPC/TiO2 system, which shows potential applications in NIR photocatalyses and degradations.
