    , Accepted 21st November 2017First published on 22nd November 2017AbstractMolecule based crosslinking agents have been applied in perovskite solar cells to produce perovskites with better crystal quality, resulting in excellent optoelectronic performance of the solar cells. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of the crystal formation process mediated by the crosslinking agents have not been studied, especially in the cases where some molecules serve as good crosslinking agents, while others with very similar molecular structures do not. In this study, we theoretically investigate the structures and properties of the crosslinking agents and provide insights into the mechanisms of the crosslinking agent-mediated perovskite crystal formation. We demonstrate that the chain lengths in the crosslinking agents are of vital importance for the crystal formation in perovskite solar cells. This study helps in the understanding of the molecule based surface/interface engineering approach of perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Halide perovskite solar cells have rapidly gained prominence to provide clean energy due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) at low cost.1–20 The high PCE levels are a result of strong and broad UV/vis light absorption, long carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths, defect tolerance and photon recycling.21–24 The solution-based fabrication route to produce perovskite films introduces a large amount of surfaces and interfaces in perovskite solar cells.25–33 These surfaces and interfaces are essential for charge transfer and device stability, and various research studies have been devoted to surface/interface engineering approaches in perovskite solar cells.11,34–43
Molecule–CH3NH3PbI3 surface or interface systems have been studied using first-principles calculations, for example, by Yin et al.44,45 The coordination and molecular adsorption approach regarding the lead halide perovskite surface/interface in perovskite solar cells are widely reviewed.46,47 The degradation effects of water molecules37,48–55 and atmospheric gas molecules56 on perovskite surfaces are probed using first principles to elucidate the detailed water degradation mechanism. The structures and properties of the molecules that provide Lewis acid–base, hydrogen bond, halogen bond and van der Waals interactions are evaluated to understand the passivation effects of the molecules that function at the perovskite surface or the three interfaces (electron transport layer/perovskite, hole transport layer/perovskite interface and perovskite/perovskite interfaces).47,57–59
Recent experiments found that introducing crosslinking agents into a perovskite system can successfully crosslink neighbouring halide perovskite crystals, improving the quality of the perovskite film and passivating the perovskite materials, leading to outstanding solar cell performance.60,61 Nevertheless, a theoretical investigation on the structures and properties of crosslinking agent/perovskite systems is unavailable at the moment. Questions remain especially in the case where some molecules serve as good crosslinking agents, while others with very similar molecular structures do not.60 This hinders the convergence of the fundamental understanding of perovskite solar cells.
In this manuscript, we employ first principles calculations to reveal the nanoscopic structure of crosslinking agent/CH3NH3PbI3 interfaces, using the bifunctional alkylphosphonic acid ω-ammonium chloride as an example, aiming to elucidate the mechanisms of the perovskite crystal formation process mediated by the crosslinking agents. Apart from their nanoscopic structures, their electronic properties such as their projected density of states (PDOS) and their electron density difference are presented to further understand crosslinking agent/perovskite systems.
Computational methods
Three bifunctional alkylphosphonic acid ω-ammonium chloride crosslinking agents including either a three-, four- or five-carbon chain (Fig. 1) are investigated: propylphosphonic acid 3-ammonium chloride (1), butylphosphonic acid 4-ammonium chloride (2), and pentylphosphonic acid 5-ammonium chloride (3). Unless otherwise specified, only the cation is employed in the model construction to benefit the convergence of the complicated interfacial system.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of 1 (n = 1), 2 (n = 2) and 3 (n = 3). 
The perovskite surface along the (001) direction is selected to study the crosslinking in perovskite solar cells since the perovskite (001) surface is very stable and has been widely investigated in perovskite solar cells.34,38,48,54,62 Three bare perovskite surfaces 4–6 (Fig. 2) are prepared: a cation-terminated perovskite surface 4, a PbI-terminated perovskite 5, and a perovskite surface 6 with an empty PbI cage. The former two are common in the literature,54,57,59,63 while the latter one exposing a PbI empty cage has been employed for molecule-based perovskite interface studies.64
 Fig. 2  Optimized structures of bare perovskite surfaces 4–6. 
The PBE functional is employed while 340 eV is the cutoff energy for the geometrical optimization and property calculations, with a geometry energy tolerance of 10−5 eV per atom and a geometry displacement tolerance of 0.002 Å. van der Waals effects65 are included in the calculation to account for the binding properties of molecules and surfaces. In order to boost the speed of the calculation on the large system and reduce the computational cost, the PBE functional without the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect is used. The PBE functional has been demonstrated to predict a material's band gap successfully, due to fortuitous error–error cancellations.66–71 A 4 × 4 × 1 mesh is used to obtain the PDOS, band structures and orbital distributions. The vacuum thickness is set at 40 Å, a value that is large enough to prevent undesirable interactions between neighbouring cells.

2 has been successfully employed as the crosslinking agent experimentally in the literature60 and is thus focused in this manuscript. In order to obtain the adsorption structures of 2 on perovskite surfaces, six possible configurations have been tested (there are two terminal functional groups –NH3 and –PO3H2 in the molecule, and each terminal functional group is placed on three perovskite surfaces 4–6). Three stable structures (7–9) are successfully obtained, while others are not converged during the geometrical optimization step. The calculation on the –PO3H2/perovskite interface indicates that the perovskite surfaces 4 and 5 interact strongly with the –PO3H2 terminal group, resulting in the formation of interfacial structures 7 and 8, respectively. On the other hand, the calculation on the –NH3/perovskite interface indicates that the –NH3 terminal group is capable of penetrating into the empty cage in 6 to form a stable structure 9, and the –NH3 terminal group resides stably therein since the size of the empty PbI cage is suitable to accommodate the molecule (vide infra).
The Discover Tools in Materials Studio is employed to investigate the water interaction, with eight water molecules randomly placed on top of the perovskite surface as the start of the MD simulation. The periodic canonical ensemble (NVT) with the COMPASS (Condensed-phase Optimized Molecular Potentials for Atomistic Simulation Studies) force field is used in the MD simulation.
Results and discussion
In 7, the two –OH groups in the –PO3H2 terminal group interact with the perovskite surface I atoms, with H⋯I distances of 2.54 A and 2.33 Å, respectively (Fig. 3), while the =O group in the –PO3H2 group interacts with an under-coordinated Pb atom in the perovskite surface, with an O⋯Pb distance of 2.42 Å. In 8, the –PO3H2 terminal group in the crosslinking agent also interacts with the perovskite surface I atoms via the two –OH groups (with H⋯I distances of 2.63 Å and 2.35 Å respectively), but the O group in the –PO3H2 terminal group features differently: the O group no longer interacts with the Pb atom which is present in 7; instead, the carbonyl (O) group in the –PO3H2 terminal group of 8 interacts with the hydrogen atom in a nearby methylammonium cation from the perovskite surface, with an O⋯H distance of 2.19 Å. The adsorbate–adsorbent anchoring modes 7 and 8 are tridentate, which are generally considered to be more stable than the bidentate or monodentate mode in optoelectronic devices.72–76 In 9, the –NH3 terminal group in the molecular adsorbate forms weak bonds with the perovskite surface via the interactions between three H atoms in the molecule and three perovskite surface I atoms, with H⋯I distances of 2.53 Å, 2.52 Å and 2.78 Å, respectively. Noteworthily, apart from the three H⋯I bonds, a fourth H atom in the adsorbate (Fig. 3) interacts with another I atom in the perovskite surface. Thus four H⋯I bonds are available in 9, and the anchoring mode is tetradentate which is very stable. The tetradentate anchoring mode in 9 requires that the –NH3 terminal group in the molecule took a specific direction (which is “downward” as shown in Fig. 3, with the –NH3 directions represented by arrows), such that the molecular adsorbate nicely occupies the perovskite surface PbI empty cage. The structure 9 is stabilized by four H⋯I bonds between the molecule H atoms and the perovskite surface I atoms in the PbI cage, compared with three H⋯I (or O⋯Pb) bonds. It should be noted that a tilted angle of the –NH3 group direction observed in 9 could result in broken H⋯I bonds between molecule hydrogen atoms and perovskite I atoms, weakening the interactions between the crosslinking agent and the perovskite surface.
 Fig. 3  Stable interfacial structures of 7–9, with the H⋯I and O⋯Pb bonds specified and their bond lengths highlighted. The arrows indicate the direction of the –NH3 terminal group in the organic molecular adsorbate. The –NH3 terminal groups in 7 and 8 are ready to interact with the perovskite substrate, while the –PO3H2 terminal group in 9 is present to reside on the perovskite crystal surface. 
The PDOS spectra of 7–9 exhibit similar features (Fig. 4). For example, the valence band near the band gap in 7–9 is mainly contributed by the p-orbitals of the I atoms and s-orbitals of the Pb atoms, while the conduction band near the band gap is primarily contributed by the p-orbitals of the Pb atoms. The alkylphosphonic acid ω-ammonium based molecule 2 (“Molecule” in Fig. 4) does not contribute considerably to the electronic bands near the band gap; rather, they contribute mainly to the density of states from −15 eV to −5 eV. The band gaps are 1.03 eV in 7, 0.95 eV in 8 and 1.42 eV in 9; 7 and 8 exhibit smaller band gaps, while 9 gives the largest band gap.

The top of the valence band is set at 0 eV. The smearing width of 0.2 eV is employed to plot the PDOS of 7–9. 
In the electron density difference plots of 7–9 (Fig. 5), the isosurface mainly resides in the anchoring groups (the –PO3H2 group in 7 and 8 and the –NH3 group in 9) and the uppermost perovskite surface layer, indicating the effectiveness of the molecules in modifying the charge properties of the perovskite surfaces. In all cases (7–9), the I atoms on the perovskite surface gain electrons due to the large electronegativity of the I atoms, while the O atoms in the molecular adsorbate are associated with a decrease of the electron densities.
 Fig. 5  Electron density difference plots of 7 and 8. An isovalue of 0.01 a.u. is used to plot the isosurface. Blue and yellow regions refer to an increase and a decrease of electronic density. 
Charge transfer between the crosslinking agents with the perovskite crystals in 7–9 is analyzed via the Hirshfeld charge analysis77 (Table S1, ESI†) and the HOMO–LUMO distributions (Fig. S1, ESI†). Upon molecular adsorption, the crosslinking agents become more negatively-charged in 7–9, while the perovskite substrates become more positively-charged; this indicates that the electrons transfer from the perovskite substrate to the crosslinking agent upon the crosslinking agent adsorption. In the meantime, spatial distributions of HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, LUMO+1, LUMO+2, LUMO+3 and LUMO+4 are plotted for 7–9 (Fig. S1, ESI†). The unoccupied orbitals are mainly localized in the crosslinking adsorbate, while the occupied orbitals are mainly distributed in the perovskite underlayer, indicating electron transfer from the perovskite substrate to the crosslinking agent in 7–9 upon light excitation. The Hirshfeld charge analysis and the molecular orbital distribution both indicate that the charge transfer occurs from the perovskite to the molecular crosslinking agent upon molecular adsorption. We analyzed the interaction between the water molecule and the perovskite interface with and without the crosslinking agents, to check closely whether the stability of the perovskite solar cell is improved. The water interactions with the crosslinking agent-capped perovskite surfaces are revealed by the molecular dynamics (MD) calculations (Fig. S2, ESI†). For the bare perovskite surface without the crosslinking agents, water molecules clearly approach the perovskite surface as time passes by (Fig. S2, ESI†). In contrast, the water molecules remain far from the perovskite surface capped by the crosslinking agents. The dramatic difference of water molecule movement in contact with the bare or capped perovskite surfaces demonstrates that the crosslinking agents can significantly improve the stability of the perovskite solar cell.
The potential energy surface (PES) plots of 7–9 are determined by moving the adsorbate along different directions at the halide perovskite surfaces (Fig. S3, ESI†). We plot the PES of the molecule/perovskite interfacial structure by moving the adsorbate along the three axes (vertical translation, x-translation and y-translation). When moving the adsorbate further away vertically from the surface in 7 and 8, the potential energies of 7 and 8 become slightly larger, which is vastly different in the case where the molecule is moved toward the perovskite surface. The potential energy increases significantly when the molecule approaches near to the perovskite surface from the stabilized position (Fig. S3, ESI†). In addition, the potential energy increases gradually when the molecule is moved along the lateral x-axis and y-axis at the perovskite surface. The trend reverses in 9 where the ammonium group is penetrated into the PbI cage: moving the molecule along the vertical axis induces large energy changes, while moving the molecule along the lateral x-axis and y-axis leads to minor energy changes. Direct band gaps of 7–9 (Fig. S4, ESI†) are observed at the gamma point (the band gaps are 1.03 eV for 7, 0.95 eV for 8 and 1.42 eV for 9). 9 exhibits the largest band gap, while 8 has the smallest band gap (the band structures and PDOS of 4–6 are plotted in Fig. S5 and S6 ESI,† respectively, for comparison purposes).
Experimental works in the literature60,61 reveal that certain molecules serve as very good crosslinking agents (such as 2), while others (such as 1 and 3) with rather similar molecular structures do not. The mechanisms of such phenomena remain elusive. Compared with 2, 1 and 3 have only a slight variation in the chain length (1 has a three-carbon chain; 2 has a four-carbon chain; 3 has a five-carbon chain), while no other structural adjustments are observed in 1–3. In order to better understand the intricate structure–property relationships of the perovskite crystal crosslinking agents and help design effective interface engineering techniques in perovskite solar cells in the future, we obtained the optimized structures of 10–13 (Fig. 6) with perovskite substrates having 1 and 3 as the adsorbates in an effort to understand the perovskite crystal crosslinking behavior. 10 and 11 correspond to molecule 1 adsorbed on surface 4 and surface 5, respectively, while 12 and 13 correspond to molecule 3 adsorbed on surface 4 and surface 5 respectively. In all cases, the –PO3H2 terminal group in the adsorbate can reside stably on perovskite surfaces. The H⋯I and O⋯Pb distances between the molecule and the perovskite surface range from 2.20 Å to 2.64 Å, which have similar values to those in 7–9. Noteworthily, the terminal group –NH3 in 10–13 points to different directions compared with those in 7 and 8: In 7 and 8, the –NH3 group points upward (perpendicular to the perovskite surface), which is intuitively more ready to penetrate into the empty PbI cage in a neighbouring perovskite crystal surface (this can be revealed in 9 in Fig. 5, where the molecule –NH3 group points downward, such that four hydrogen atoms in the molecule can interact with four iodine atoms in the PbI cage, and tetradentate anchoring modes are formed). In this way the neighbouring perovskite crystals can arrange into a well aligned structure that is easy to have further crystal growth. However, in 10–13, the –NH3 terminal group no longer adopts an upward arrangement that is easy to penetrate into an empty PbI cage in a neighbouring perovskite crystal surface. Instead, the –NH3 group in 10–13 is substantially tilted, and its direction is almost parallel to the perovskite surface. This poses serious problems to the perovskite crystal growth, since the stable tetradentate anchoring mode is difficult to preserve, and the neighbouring perovskite crystals are not well-aligned. This is very important to the perovskite crystal quality because it is challenging for the poorly aligned perovskite surface layers to form large three-dimensional crystals.
 Fig. 6  Stable interfacial structures of 10–13. The arrows indicate the direction of the –NH3 terminal group in the organic molecular adsorbate. The directions of the –NH3 terminal group in 10–13 are not perpendicular to the perovskite surfaces. 
The above explanation regarding the perovskite crystal growth mechanisms mediated by crosslinking agents is summarized in Fig. 7, where the left of Fig. 7 corresponds to the “poor crosslinking” scenario employing 1 and 3, while the right of Fig. 7 corresponds to the “good crosslinking” scenario employing 2. The tilted –NH3 terminal group in the former case hinders the formation of four H⋯I interactions, while the direction of the terminal group in the latter case favours a tetradentate anchoring mode. “Good crosslinking” agents such as 2 lead to well aligned perovskite crystals due to the stable interaction between the molecule and the surface PbI cage, which is not observed in the “poor crosslinking” case. Our calculation agrees well with the experimental observation, where 1 and 3 lead to non-uniform perovskite coverage on the electron transport layer and poor perovskite crystal quality.60,61 In contrast, the addition of 2 to the perovskite fabrication process leads to better perovskite crystal quality, improved perovskite film coverage on the TiO2 underlayer and enhanced PCE of the resulting solar cell device.60

Conclusions
The crosslinking agent 2 interacts with perovskite surfaces via either a –PO3H2 terminal group or a –NH3 terminal group. The adsorption geometry of the crystal crosslinking agent on perovskite surfaces is determined using first principles calculations, which indicate that the interactions between the crosslinking agent and the perovskite surfaces are stabilized by weak H⋯I bonds and O⋯Pb bonds, resulting in either a tridentate anchoring mode or a tetradentate anchoring mode. We demonstrate that a slight modification in the crosslinking agent such as the chain length could cause vast differences in the crystal crosslinking behavior. Changing the chain length in the alkylphosphonic acid ω-ammonium-based crosslinking agent leads to a different alignment of the terminal groups with respect to the perovskite surfaces, which further leads to either a well-aligned or a misaligned perovskite-crosslinking agent–perovskite interfacial structure. Future design of the crosslinking agents and related interfacial engineering techniques should consider the intricate interactions between molecules and perovskite surfaces/interfaces, since a small variation in the molecular structure has a tremendous impact on the optoelectronic performance of the solar cell originating from crystal formation. Efforts should be focused on the formulation of more unified structure–property relationships of the molecules for the perovskite surface/interface engineering approach.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Molecular structures of 1 (n = 1), 2 (n = 2) and 3 (n = 3).	 

 	Fig. 2  Optimized structures of bare perovskite surfaces 4–6.	 

 	Fig. 3  Stable interfacial structures of 7–9, with the H⋯I and O⋯Pb bonds specified and their bond lengths highlighted. The arrows indicate the direction of the –NH3 terminal group in the organic molecular adsorbate. The –NH3 terminal groups in 7 and 8 are ready to interact with the perovskite substrate, while the –PO3H2 terminal group in 9 is present to reside on the perovskite crystal surface.	 

 	Fig. 4  PDOS spectra of 7–9, decomposed into contributions from the molecular adsorbate 2 (Molecule), carbon atoms (C), nitrogen atoms (N), oxygen atoms (O), phosphorus atoms (P), hydrogen atoms (H), lead atoms (Pb) and iodine atoms (I). The top of the valence band is set at 0 eV. The smearing width of 0.2 eV is employed to plot the PDOS of 7–9.	 

 	Fig. 5  Electron density difference plots of 7 and 8. An isovalue of 0.01 a.u. is used to plot the isosurface. Blue and yellow regions refer to an increase and a decrease of electronic density.	 

 	Fig. 6  Stable interfacial structures of 10–13. The arrows indicate the direction of the –NH3 terminal group in the organic molecular adsorbate. The directions of the –NH3 terminal group in 10–13 are not perpendicular to the perovskite surfaces.	 

 	Fig. 7  Proposed crosslinking of two neighbouring perovskite crystals via different crosslinking agents. Left: The “poor crosslinking” scenario using 1 (with three –CH2 groups) and 3 (with five –CH2 groups) as the crosslinking agents. Right: The “good crosslinking” scenario using 2 as the crosslinking agent.
