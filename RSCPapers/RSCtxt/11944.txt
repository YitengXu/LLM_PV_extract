    , Accepted 8th July 2013First published on 9th July 2013AbstractFor the first time, undoped and Yb3+/Ln3+ (Ln = Ho, Er, Tm) codoped orthorhombic lutetium oxyfluorides have been fabricated via a facile stepwise route involving room temperature co-precipitation and a subsequent thermal decomposition procedure. The phase formation, crystal structure, particle morphologies and up-conversion (UC) luminescence were investigated by means of powder X-ray diffraction, TEM, IR, thermal and luminescence spectroscopy. It has been found that the intermediate Lu(CO3)1−x(OH)yF1+2x−y precursor plays an essential role in the formation of the final metastable LunOn−1Fn+2 Vernier phase. Multicolour up-conversion has been achieved in the Yb3+/Tm3+, Yb3+/Ho3+ and Yb3+/Er3+ codoped samples under near-infrared excitation (λ = 980 nm) and, notably, the Yb3+/Er3+ codoping yields an almost single-band red emission at about 660 nm. A short Ln3+–Ln3+ distance combined with the multiple doping sites in the low symmetry (C1 and Cs) host lattice are considered responsible for the effective energy transfer and, therefore, the intense up-conversion emission. The present work, together with previous studies on the UC performance of Vernier phase yttrium oxyfluorides, illustrates that the Vernier phase oxyfluorides are promising up-conversion host materials for lanthanide ions in a variety of applications such as bioprobes and chromatic displays.
1 Introduction
Luminescent materials doped with trivalent lanthanide ions (Ln3+) have been under extensive investigation for a long time for various applications such as biological labels, chromatic displays, solid-state lasers and improving the efficiency of solar cells, owing to their high quantum yields, sharp emission lines, long lifetimes and superior photostabilities.1–8 In particular, Ln3+-doped up-conversion (UC) nanoparticles utilizing near-infrared (NIR) excitation and emitting photons in the visible range hold several advantages for modern bio-imaging and bio-sensing applications over conventional fluorescence techniques:9–11 (1) low photodamage to living organisms; (2) non-autofluorescence, high detection sensitivity and a high signal-to-noise ratio; and (3) the deep penetration of non-invasive NIR excitation wavelengths is well-suited for in vivo imaging. Previous research efforts have mostly concentrated on the optimization of several well-known UC materials, including the phase and particle size controlled syntheses of fluorides such as NaLnF4,12 KLn3F10,13 NaxScF3+x,14etc., with the aim of achieving advanced optical performance.
An appropriate host matrix is essential for the optical transitions of Ln3+ ions, and subsequently for the realization of favourable UC properties such as high-efficiency and emission band selectivity. Among the various inorganic materials available, fluorides and oxides are considered to be effective for the UC luminescence of lanthanide ions owing to their low phonon energies, which are appropriate for energy transfer.15–22 In particular, hexagonal NaYF4 is acknowledged as the most efficient UC host material to date,23,24 the refined crystallographic site symmetry of which has also been taken into account during the latest investigations.25 It is generally assumed that disorder in the host structure, which leads to multiple sites for Ln3+ ions with slightly different energy level schemes, is responsible for the intense NIR to visible UC luminescence. From this point of view, lanthanide oxyfluorides may also be considered as a class of potential candidates due to their abundant structure types (e.g., cubic Fmm, SmSI-type Rm and PbFCl-type P4/nmm) and the ever-present distortion in their crystal lattices.26–37 However, at present, investigations related to the use of these materials as efficient UC luminescence hosts are rare, especially the orthorhombic incommensurate Vernier phase LnnOn−1Fn+2 (where n is an integer and the space group is Abm2 or Pcmb).
In our previous work, we investigated Ln3+-doped Vernier phase Y6O5F8 (denoted as V-YOF) nanocrystals fabricated via a facile low-temperature route.38 The intense and multicolour UC luminescence of the as-obtained nanoparticles under NIR irradiation indicates that they are promising as novel UC phosphors. The orthorhombic crystal structure (Pcmb, a = 5.4141(3) Å, b = 6 × 5.526(1) Å, c = 5.5319(1) Å) originates from the fluorite-type structure, but differs significantly from any of the other familiar structure types of lanthanide oxyfluorides mentioned above. The assorted array of O2− and F− ions in the a × nb × c unit cell offers several possible doping sites with different symmetries (C1, C2 and Cs) and thus gives rise to intense UC luminescence. Moreover, Ma et al.39 have recently reported the UC properties of Yb3+/Tm3+-doped Y7O6F9 powders. Teshima’s and Gao's groups reported the strong NIR to visible UC fluorescence of YO1−xF1+2x layers and YOF nanoparticles,40,41 respectively, but without performing refined structure analyses.
Recently, Passuello et al.42 reported the Ce3+, Pr3+ and Eu3+ doped Vernier phase of Lu10O9F12 hosts as candidates for scintillators and X-ray phosphors. Since, both the lutetium and yttrium Vernier phases adopt the same disordered crystal structure, and Lu3+ (0.861 Å) is smaller than Y3+ (0.900 Å), comparative or even better UC performances are expected for Ln3+ codoped Vernier phase lutetium oxyfluorides. Herein, we report the fabrication of pure undoped and Yb3+/Tm3+, Yb3+/Ho3+, Yb3+/Er3+ codoped Vernier phase lutetium oxyfluoride phosphors via a facile two-step process. The products are characterized by means of PXRD, TEM, SAED, FT-IR, TG-MS and up-conversion emission spectroscopy, respectively. Multicolour UC luminescence of high intensity was achieved in the as-obtained materials and the optical properties are proposed to be associated with the disordered crystal structures. This result demonstrates that the Vernier phase lanthanide oxyfluorides are very promising host materials for the generation of UC luminescence in modern bio-imaging and bio-sensing applications.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of undoped, Yb3+/Ho3+, Yb3+/Er3+ and Yb3+/Tm3+ codoped Vernier phase LunOn−1Fn+2
Samples of pure and Ln3+-doped Vernier phase lutetium oxyfluoride nanocrystals (hereafter denoted as V-LuOF) were prepared using a two-step route, involving the coprecipitation of Lu3+/Ln3+ ions with CO32− and F− in water and subsequent thermal decomposition at 420 °C, similar to that described in previously reported studies.38 All of the lanthanide oxides (Lu2O3, Yb2O3, Ho2O3, Tm2O3 and Er2O3, 99.99%) were preheated at 900 °C for 10 h in order to remove CO2 and moisture. Aqueous solutions of lanthanide ions (0.01–0.4 M) were prepared by dissolving the oxides in hot nitric acid. In a typical synthesis of the 20% Yb and 0.2% Ho codoped V-LuOF sample, 4.0 ml Lu(NO3)3 (0.4 M), 4.0 ml Yb(NO3)3 (0.1 M), 0.4 ml Ho(NO3)3 (0.01 M) acidic solutions were first mixed in 150 ml deionized water. The pH value was then adjusted to approximately 6 using a 0.1 M NaOH solution. After, a solution of 12 mmol NaF and 12 mmol NaHCO3 in 150 ml H2O was added drop wise, with continuous stirring, followed by vigorous stirring for 30 minutes. The mixture was centrifuged and washed with distilled water (×3) and ethanol (×1) and then dried at 80 °C overnight. Finally, the resulting powders were transferred into an alumina crucible and annealed at 420 °C for 24 h, in air, with a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C h−1.
2.2 Characterization and instruments
The crystal structures of the as-obtained undoped and Ln3+-doped V-LuOF samples were identified by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis using a Rigaku D/Max-2000 diffractometer at room temperature (25 °C) with a rotating anode (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV and 100 mA), graphite monochromator and scintillation detector. The least-squares refinements of the cell dimensions and atomic positions of all of the samples were performed using TOPAS 2.1 software,43 adopting the previously reported structural parameters of Y5O4F7 as an initial model.44
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) images were captured using a transmission electron microscope (Tecnai G2 20, S-TWIN) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Elemental analysis was performed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) with the same instrument. Fourier transform infrared absorption (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using a NICOLET iN10MX spectrometer with KBr pellets and in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. Differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetry (DTA-TG) analysis were performed in an air atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 50 to 900 °C, using a NETZSCH STA449C instrument, followed by simultaneous mass spectrometry (MS). The up-conversion luminescence spectra were obtained at room temperature using a modified Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer with a tunable 2 W 980 nm laser diode (Beijing) as the excitation source.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and morphology of the V-LuOF nanoparticles

Fig. 1 shows the PXRD patterns of the precursors synthesized using the coprecipitation of Lu3+/Ln3+ with CO32− and F− in aqueous solution with samples annealed at different temperatures under an air atmosphere. The amorphous precursor changes to the pure Vernier phase lutetium oxyfluoride after being annealed at 420 °C, on account of all of the Bragg peaks being consistent with the orthorhombic LunOn−1Fn+2 phase. However, using the PXRD data, we could not ascribe the as-prepared samples to any specific composition with an exact n value. Le Bail fitting of the undoped sample was performed with TOPAS 2.1 software43 using the orthorhombic crystal system, giving the following lattice parameters: a = 5.3305(3) Å, b = n × 5.447(1) Å, c = 5.4545(5) Å and V = n × 157.61(4) Å3. Previously, Petzel et al.45 determined the stoichiometry and cell parameters of LunOn−1Fn+2 (n = 5–10) Vernier phases using thermal and PXRD analyses. Cell volume contraction was observed along with a decrease of the Lu:(O, F) ratios. The refined cell volume of the as-prepared updoped sample turns out to be in reasonable agreement with that of the reported n = 5 phase (5 × 157.67 Å3). A detailed comparison between the cell parameters of our as-obtained samples and those reported in ref. 44 are shown in Table S1,† together with the Le Bail fitting plots, as shown in Fig. S1.† It was found that the Vernier phase lutetium oxyfluorides with different n values possess very small differences in their lattice parameters. For simplicity, we have adopted n = 5 and the space group Abm2 for the present samples for use in the Rietveld refinements, following the previous discussion by Passuello et al.42 As the annealing temperature was increased to 600 °C, a continuation of the growth of the particles occurred, as indicated by the narrow FWHM value (Fig. S2†). However, after annealing at 900 °C, the sample mostly decomposed to cubic Lu2O3. We checked the overall temperature range for the formation of phase-pure V-YOF, and found that only a narrow region from about 400 to 650 °C was appropriate.

The short vertical bars represent the main theoretical Bragg reflection positions of cubic Lu2O3 (Ia, ICSD#23811), and n = 5 Vernier phase Lu5O4F7 (Abm2, a = 5.3055(3) Å, b = 27.232(2) Å, c = 5.4545(5) Å). 

Fig. 2a and c show typical TEM images of the V-LuOF nanocrystals annealed at 420 °C. The particle sizes of both the pure and Ln3+-doped samples range from approximately 30 to 40 nm, which are consistent with the average particle size values estimated from the Rietveld refinements based on the PXRD data (46 ± 5 nm). The SAED pattern (Fig. 2b) shows polycrystalline diffraction rings corresponding to the [151], [200], [0102], [1151], [2102], etc., indices of the orthorhombic V-LuOF crystal (Abm2, a = 5.3055(3) Å, b = 27.232(2) Å, c = 5.4545(5) Å). The single crystal nature of the nanoparticles was confirmed by the appearance of clear lattice fringes in the HRTEM images of the Ln3+-doped V-LuOF samples (as shown in Fig. S3†). Our previous studies have revealed that a stepwise synthesis procedure is appropriate for Ln3+ ion doping. In this work, we also checked the elemental ratios of Lu, Yb, Ho, Er and Tm in the final products, and good agreement with those of the raw materials were observed (as shown in Fig. 2d). Moreover, the F/O ratio is also reasonably consistent with the nominal composition of Vernier phase LunOn−1Fn+2.

3.2 The stepwise precursor-assisted formation of Vernier phase LunOn−1Fn+2
The present two-step synthesis procedure for pure and Ln3+-doped V-LuOF nanoparticles involves the coprecipitation of Lu3+/Ln3+ ions with CO32− and F− at room temperature and subsequent annealing at 420 °C. This synthetic process is similar to that used by Janka and Schleid,46 for the synthesis of LaOF, in which three phases of LaOF were obtained from the decomposition of LaCO3F according to the equation:LaCO3F → LaOF + CO2↑
However, the detailed phase formation mechanism in this work must be different, because the F content in stoichiometric “LuCO3F” is inadequate for the V-LuOF products where the F/Lu ratio is bigger than 1. FT-IR spectral measurements were obtained from 400 to 4000 cm−1 at room temperature, in order to investigate the composition of the precursor obtained using the coprecipitation procedure, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The characteristic peaks at 1385 cm−1 and 852 cm−1 can be assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration and bend vibration of anionic CO32−, while the peak at about 3500 cm−1 shows the existence of OH−. The DTA-TG curves together with the MS results of the precursor samples also confirm the release of H2O and CO2 during the decomposition process between 100 and 600 °C (Fig. 4). The characteristic IR signal of CO32− at 1385 cm−1 remains after being heated at 420 °C for 24 hours indicating their existence on the surface of the V-LuOF particles. Based on the experimental evidence, we propose the real composition of the precursor to be Lu(CO3)1−x(OH)yF1+2x−y (x > y/2 > 0), in which the ratio of Lu/F (<1) is just about coincident with that of Vernier phase LunOn−1Fn+2. The weight loss up to 600 °C of −15.1% in good accordance with the assumed formula of the precursor.

3.3 Rietveld refinement of the crystal structure of V-LuOF using the powder X-ray diffraction data
The currently known stoichiometric Vernier phase oxyfluorides only exist with small lanthanide elements and have nominal compositions of LunOn−1Fn+2 (n = 5–10) and YnOn−1Fn+2 (n = 5–7). For the as-obtained samples, we roughly assign them to the formula Lu5O4F7, which is supported by both the elemental analysis and the refined cell parameters. However, detailed crystal structure of V-LuOF beyond the cell parameters are not available in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. In order to further investigate the structure and properties, Rietveld refinement was performed using TOPAS 2.1 software43 with Y5O4F7 (ICSD#68949)44 used as an initial structure model. Accordingly, the O/F distribution and disorder of the structure were also treated by simply following those of Y5O4F7.
The refinement plot and structure of Vernier phase Lu5O4F7 are shown in Fig. 5. The host material crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic space group Abm2 and has an elongated a × nb × c unit cell (n = 5) derived from a fluorite-type structure, where a = 5.3055(3) Å, b = 5.4464(1) Å and c = 5.4545(5) Å. There are three crystallographic positions offered by the assorted array of O2− and F− ions for the 8-fold coordinated Lu3+ ions in the lattice, and they are arranged alternately along the b-axis. Table 1 lists the detailed atomic positions and other cell parameters of the Vernier phase Lu5O4F7. The static distribution of O3 and F1 in the 8d position is treated in the same way as those in the Vernier phase Y5O4F7 structure, and the isotropic temperature factors are defined as the same of the three Lu atoms and all of the O/F atoms.

Selected bond lengths and bond valence sums (BVS)47 of the Lu atoms are listed in Table 2. Despite normal BVS values for the three Lu atoms of around +3, they show distinct coordination environments, both in the number of O/F ligands and their largely diverged bond lengths: Lu1 in a C1 site is coordinated with 4O and 4F; Lu2 in a C1 site is coordinated with 4F, 2O and 2O/F; and Lu3 in a Cs symmetric site is coordinated with 4O and 4O/F, as shown in Fig. 6. It is generally believed that the disorder and multiple doping sites in the host structure endow the Ln3+ ions with slightly different energy levels and this is proposed to give rise to additional resonance between Ln3+ neighbours, resulting in an efficient energy transfer that leads to the UC luminescence. Therefore, it is worth looking into the promising UC emitting performance of the Ln3+ codoped V-LuOF nanocrystals.

3.4 Multicolor up-conversion luminescence of Yb3+/Ln3+ (Ln = Ho, Er, Tm) codoped V-LuOF
The UC properties of the Yb3+/Ln3+ (Ln = Tm, Ho, Er) codoped V-LuOF nanocrystals calcined at 420 °C were evaluated under the excitation of a 980 nm laser diode at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 7. The optimized Ln3+ doping concentrations are 20% Yb3+ with 0.05% Tm3+, 0.2% Ho3+ and 0.2% Er3+ shown in parts a, b and c, respectively. In addition, the bulk powder samples present purple, yellow and red UC emissions, as shown in the insets of Fig. 7. Four UC emission bands can be clearly identified in the spectrum of the Yb3+/Tm3+ codoped nanocrystals: the strongest emission band with a maximum at 479 nm is attributed to the 1G4 → 3H6 transition. The other three weaker bands centered at 546, 652, 690 nm are due to the 1D2 → 3H5, 1G4 → 3F4, 3F3 → 3H6 transitions, respectively. Likewise, the green emission (∼540 nm) and the red emission (∼650 nm) of the 20% Yb3+ with 0.2% Ho3+ sample originate from the 5F4, 5S2 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5I8 transitions, respectively. It is worth noting that in the Yb3+/Er3+ codoped sample, an almost single-band red UC emission around 660 nm was observed, which can be assigned to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of the Er3+ ion. The 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 emission at about 550 nm, is almost too weak to be detected. Recently, much research attention has been concentrated on high purity, single-band UC red phosphors for bio-labeling and anti-counterfeiting applications. To date, materials featuring high red-to-green (R/G) emission ratios are rather rare and most of these rely upon the energy transfer between codoped Ln3+ and Mn2+ ions.19,48–51 Thus, the Yb3+/Er3+ codoped V-LuOF nanocrystals can be considered to be very promising optical bio-labels for deep-tissue imaging without the constraints associated with conventional multi-peak UC materials.
 Fig. 7  Room-temperature up-conversion emission spectra of the Yb3+/Ln3+ codoped V-LuOF nanocrystals: (a) Ln = Tm; (b) Ln = Ho; and (c) Ln = Er. The insets show photographs of the respective powder samples excited at 980 nm with a 100 mW diode laser (power density: ∼10 mW mm−2). 

Fig. 8 shows the UC luminescence intensity versus the excitation power density on a double logarithmic scale for the dominant blue (∼460 nm), green (∼540 nm) and red (∼650 nm) emission bands in the Yb3+/Tm3+, Er3+, Ho3+ codoped V-LuOF nanocrystals under excitation at 980 nm. The values measured for the slopes of the above emissions are 1.9 for 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 of Er3+, 1.9 for 5F4, 5S2 → 5I8 of Ho3+, 2.2 for 5F5 → 5I8 of Ho3+, and 2.9 for 1G4 → 3H6 of Tm3+. It is known that the logarithmic intensity of the UC luminescence is proportional to the excitation intensity, and that the slope, n, corresponds to the order of the UC process. Accordingly, observations suggest that the green and red UC luminescence emissions from the Ho3+ and Er3+ excited states involve a two photon process, while at least three photons are involved in the blue 1G4 → 3H6 UC emission of Tm3+ (as shown in Fig. S4†).

A comparison between the UC emission bands of the Yb3+/Er3+ codoped V-LuOF and previously studied Yb3+/Er3+ codoped V-YOF is presented in Fig. 9. The remarkable difference in the R/G ratios can be attributed to a slight difference in the ionic radii of Lu3+ (0.861 Å) and Y3+ (0.900 Å), which results in a shorter Lu3+–Lu3+ bond distance (3.502 Å) relative to that of Y3+–Y3+ (3.573 Å) when present in a similar O/F-bridged host lattice. This demonstrates that desirable UC properties depend, not only on low symmetry multiplex sites within the host structures, but also on the delicate structural details of similar host materials.

4 Conclusions
We have described a facile precursor decomposition method for the preparation of lanthanide doped V-LuOF nanoparticles. The highly disordered host crystal structure, on account of the assorted array of O2− and F− ions, provides multiple low symmetry crystallographic sites suitable for Ln3+ doping. Intense and multicolour NIR to visible UC luminescence has been observed by optimization of the doping conditions. Remarkably, an almost pure single-band red UC emission was achieved for the 20% Yb3+ and 0.2% Er3+ codoped samples. The excellent UC performance of the Vernier phase oxyfluorides doped with Ln3+ ions makes them a potential new platform for applications such as bioprobes, chromatic displays and optical nanodevices.
