    , Accepted 1st May 2019First published on 1st May 2019AbstractConventional two-electrode water electrolyzers produce H2 accompanied by O2, and may suffer from gas mixing and high cell voltage inputs. Herein, we introduce a low-cost conducting polymer material polyaniline (PANI) as a solid-state redox mediator for decoupling the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. It allows these two half-reactions to be separated from each other in time during the electrolysis of water. As an intermediary material for charge storage, the PANI electrode exhibits a remarkable reversible discharge capacity of 125 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. Moreover, an approach by controlling the equilibrium potential of the PANI electrode is developed to balance the separate cell voltages. In this way, the decoupled HER and OER can be sequentially driven at close cell voltages of only 0.8 V. Considering the low cost of PANI and its excellent electrochemical performance, this study paves the way for the practical application of this state-of-the-art decoupling strategy.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen is considered an ideal energy carrier because of its high energy density and eco-friendly product (H2O).1–3 Water is the largest reservoir of hydrogen and water splitting to produce hydrogen can be driven, ideally by renewable-generated power such as solar or wind.4–6 Electrochemical water splitting is divided into two half-reactions: the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).7–9 In conventional water splitting systems, these two half-reactions occur simultaneously and the gas products H2 and O2 are separated by using a proton exchange membrane.10–12 However, such an electrolyzer configuration will greatly increase the mass transfer resistance between the catalytic electrodes, especially in the case of large current electrolysis.13 In addition, high-pressure H2 and O2 gases produced in the individual compartments may cross through the membrane to each other, producing an explosive H2/O2 mixture.14,15 Consequently, a post-process of purification is usually required to obtain pure H2 gas for various applications, leading to an increase in economic cost.16 To overcome these drawbacks, it is significant to develop a new strategy for decoupling water splitting half-reactions.
Recently, a new approach to avoid H2 and O2 mixing or to obtain pure H2 gas of high economical value is to temporally decouple the HER and OER.17,18 As a pioneering study in this line of research, the concept of the electron-coupled proton buffer (ECPB) was introduced by the Cronin group, whereby O2 and H2 can be produced at separate times during water electrolysis by using redox mediators.19–21 This approach is remarkable in contrast to spatially separated O2 and H2 production in a conventional electrolyzer. However, redox mediators used in this study suffer from low capacity charge storage because of their high molecular weights (H3Mo12PO40, MW > 1800 g mol−1; H4SiW12O40, MW > 2800 g mol−1).19–21 Although the utilization of redox mediators such as small organic molecules with good solubility in water may increase the charge storage capacity, homogeneous molecules may diffuse to the counterpart electrode followed by side reactions, thus decreasing the coulombic efficiency.22,23 In this case, a proton exchange membrane is still necessitated with implications for the durability and price of such devices.
To overcome this problem, Wang and Xia et al. recently utilized Ni(OH)2/NiOOH as an inorganic solid-state redox mediator to temporally decouple the HER and OER under alkaline conditions.24,25 In the first step, water reduction to hydrogen occurs at the HER catalytic electrode which is accompanied by the oxidation of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH at the intermediary electrode (Ni(OH)2 + OH− − e− → NiOOH + H2O). In the second step, NiOOH is re-reduced to Ni(OH)2 (NiOOH + H2O + e− → Ni(OH)2 + OH−) by switching the polarity of the power supply; with the stored charge released, water oxidation to oxygen occurs at the OER catalytic electrode. As another solid material of large family members, conducting polymers are gaining increasing attention in the field of energy storage and conversion, because of their low cost and excellent chemical and physical properties that can be regulated by composition and structure designing.26,27 For example, conducting polymers have been proved to be very promising electrode materials for batteries and capacitors. Conducting polymers used in electrochemical energy storage usually have appropriate redox potentials, good redox reversibility, and high capacity for reserving charges. In this regard, conducting polymers may also serve as ideal candidates of organic solid-state redox mediators for decoupled water splitting, enabling the decoupling strategy to be more competitive.28,29
Herein, we introduce the application of low-cost polyaniline (PANI) as a solid-state redox mediator for decoupling the HER and OER in acidic media. As shown in Scheme 1, water splitting to produce H2 and O2 can be decoupled into two sequential steps driven by smaller cell voltages with redox equivalents stored in PANI associated with ion doping/dedoping. The PANI material exhibits reversible redox couples between the HER and OER onsets, pointing to an excellent candidate for redox mediators for the decoupling application. Due to its simple structural units of low molecular weight and appropriate redox potentials, the PANI electrode exhibits a high reversible discharge capacity of 125 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 for decoupling the HER and OER. Moreover, by optimizing the redox state of the PANI electrode, the decoupled HER and OER can be sequentially driven by balanced cell voltages down to 0.8 V. Compared with the conventional electrolyzer, the high voltage required for overall water splitting reaction is divided into two close low voltages for the decoupled HER and OER.
 Scheme 1  A schematic illustration of the operation process for decoupling water splitting. The H2 production process involves proton reduction at the HER electrocatalytic electrode accompanied by oxidation of the reduction-state PANI (r-PANI, dedoped) electrode. The O2 production process involves H2O oxidation at the OER electrocatalytic electrode accompanied by reduction of the oxidation-state PANI (o-PANI, doped) electrode. 
2. Results and discussion
The PANI powder was facilely synthesized by chemical oxidation polymerization of aniline (ANI) monomers with ammonium peroxodisulfate (APS) as the oxidant agent and MnO2 as the initiator in 1 M HCl in an ice water bath under stirring.30 A detailed procedure of the synthesis is presented in the Experimental section in the ESI.† Note that for better mixing, the conductive agent carbon black was added into the reaction solution during the polymerization of aniline. The results of characterization in Fig. S1–S5† indicate that the as-synthesized PANI is in the form of a dark green powder, which is of poor crystallinity with a loose, layered structure. To prepare the PANI film electrode, the PANI powder was then pressed onto a Ti-mesh at a pressure of 10 MPa for 2 minutes.
To achieve efficient water splitting in a conventional electrolyzer, a practical voltage ≥ 1.6 V is usually required, consisting of the theoretical decomposition voltage (1.23 V) and the unavoidable overpotential (>300 mV).31,32 At present, most of the single solar cells and alkaline dry cells cannot meet this large voltage requirement and directly drive the water splitting.33,34 In the decoupled water splitting process, however, the single-step large power input may be fulfilled by two-step small power inputs, making the water splitting reactions match better with the existing power supplies.
As shown in Fig. 1A, the difference (ΔE = 1.23 V) between the theoretical onset potentials of the HER and OER represents the minimum voltage required for the overall water splitting. In the decoupling configuration, this voltage can be rationally divided and applied sequentially to the HER and OER half-reactions, with the aid of the intermediary electrode as the redox mediator (note Scheme 1). The cell voltage required for the individual HER (ΔE1) and OER (ΔE2) is dependent on the potential of the redox mediator. Ideally, ΔE1 ≈ ΔE2 could be realized when the potential of the redox mediator is located in the middle of HER and OER onsets. As a result, the same power source of small voltages can be applied to sequentially drive the HER and OER, strengthening the merit of the decoupling strategy. In this regard, the development of redox mediators with an appropriate redox potential is the key to balance the two power inputs. In literature reports, although a few redox mediators have been explored for the decoupling strategy, the individual voltages applied for the decoupled HER and OER have not been well balanced and a high voltage > 1.23 V is still required for at least one half-reaction.19–21

ΔE is the theoretical voltage required in the conventional water splitting system; ΔE1 and ΔE2 are voltages required for the decoupled HER and OER by using a redox mediator. (B) CV curve of the PANI film electrode, and LSV curves of the Pt electrode for the HER and the RuO2/IrO2 electrode for the OER at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. 
The electrochemical performance of the PANI material was first investigated in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution using a typical three-electrode setup. Fig. 1B shows the cyclic voltammogram (CV) curve of the PANI film electrode, along with the linear scan voltammogram (LSV) curves of the Pt electrode for the HER and the commercial RuO2/IrO2 electrode for the OER. The CV curve of PANI displays two characteristic redox couples, which are attributed to the transitions between different doping states of PANI, namely leucoemeraldine–emeraldine (E1/2 = 0.39 V) and emeraldine–pernigraniline (0.85 V) coupled with loss and gain of electrons on PANI.35 The redox couples of PANI are located between the HER and OER onsets, indicating that PANI can be used as a redox mediator to decouple the water splitting.23 The good symmetry of the redox waves indicates the high electrochemical reversibility of the PANI electrode.
The kinetics of the PANI film electrode was investigated by CV measurements at scan rates from 20 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4. As shown in Fig. 2A, the peak current of the anodic wave varies linearly with the square root of the scan rate. This indicates a diffusion-controlled doping/dedoping process of the PANI electrode that is related to the diffusion process of H+ inside the solid-state PANI electrode. The kinetics of the electrode process was also analyzed via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements and the EIS plot is shown in Fig. 2B. The intercept of the EIS curve with the X-axis represents an internal resistance of Rs = 10 Ω for the system. In the high-frequency domain, the EIS curve features a small semicircle, indicating a small charge transfer resistance of Rct = 7.5 Ω for the redox reaction of emeraldine/pernigraniline.35 In addition, a linear curve was observed in the low-frequency domain of the EIS curve, consistent with the diffusion-controlled kinetics of the doping/dedoping process of the PANI electrode.

(B) EIS of the PANI film electrode at the open circuit potential. Inset: the corresponding equivalent circuit diagram. 
The effectiveness of PANI as a redox mediator was then evaluated by examining the cell voltages required to deliver a given current density for the decoupled water splitting. Fig. 3A shows the reductive LSVs of the Pt electrode and PANI electrode in a three-electrode system in 0.5 M H2SO4. The proton reduction to H2 at the Pt electrode and reduction of the PANI electrode require a bias of −0.08 V and 0.56 V, respectively, to reach a current density of 50 mA cm−2. Correspondingly, Fig. 3B shows that the PANI electrode can deliver an oxidative current density of 50 mA cm−2 at 0.75 V, whereas water oxidation to O2 at the RuO2/IrO2 electrode requires 1.65 V to achieve the same current density.

(B) LSVs for water oxidation to O2 at the RuO2/IrO2 electrode and oxidation of the PANI electrode. (C) Galvanostatic charge–discharge and (D) cycling stability curves of the PANI electrode at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. 
Based on the above data, we analyse the cell voltages required to produce a given current density of 50 mA cm−2 during the decoupled water splitting. For the OER with the electrode pair RuO2/IrO2‖PANI, it requires a cell voltage of 1.09 (=1.65 − 0.56) V to oxidize water to oxygen, which is accompanied by reduction of the PANI electrode. Correspondingly, for the HER with the electrode pair PANI‖Pt, it requires a cell voltage of 0.83 (0.75 − (−0.08)) V to reach the same current density by reduction of protons to H2 and re-oxidation of PANI. This gives an overall voltage requirement of 1.92 (=1.09 + 0.83) V in the decoupled two-step process. This value is only slightly higher than 1.73 (=1.65 − (−0.08)) V required for the conventional RuO2/IrO2‖Pt electrolyzer due to the internal resistance of the intermediary PANI electrode.19,22 Moreover, because the decoupled water splitting by using PANI can be achieved with two-step power inputs, it potentially allows the renewable-generated power of lower voltages to be directly employed for water splitting.
The charge storage capacity of the PANI film electrode was measured by galvanostatic charge–discharge tests in 0.5 M H2SO4. As shown in Fig. 3C, it exhibits a reversible discharge capacity of 125 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 in the potential range from 0.1 to 1.2 V, which is higher than that of the soluble phosphomolybdic acid (27.6 mA h g−1) or silicotungstic acid (18.6 mA h g−1) and the solid-state polytriphenylamine (77 mA h g−1) as redox mediators.19,20 The high capacity of PANI is attributed to the multiple redox processes, and the wide redox potential window, as well as the simple structural units of low molecular weight. We also conducted the charge–discharge measurement on the PANI electrode at higher rates. As shown in Fig. S6,† a reversible capacity of 53 mA h g−1 can still be achieved at a high rate of 5 A g−1, indicating the high reversibility of the PANI electrode. The stability of the PANI electrode was tested at a charge–discharge rate of 0.2 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 3D and Fig. S7,† the PANI electrode displays an excellent coulombic efficiency around 100% during 40 cycles with capacity retention about 92%.
After establishing the energetics and capacity of PANI as a redox mediator using the standard three-electrode setup, we explore possibility of using it to decouple electrolytic water splitting. As demonstrated in Fig. S8,† the decoupled electrolyzer setup is constructed with a commercial RuO2/IrO2-coated Ti-mesh electrode for the OER (left), a PANI film electrode as the solid-state redox mediator (middle), and a commercial Pt-coated Ti-mesh electrode for the HER (right). The whole electrolyzer setup is designated as RuO2/IrO2‖PANI‖Pt. The equilibrium potential is an important feature for the PANI material, which is dependent on its charge–discharge state. Fig. 4A and B show that the applied voltages for triggering the HER and OER are closely associated with the equilibrium potential of the PANI electrode. By increasing the equilibrium potential of PANI from 0.4 V to 0.8 V, the applied voltage for the OER onset is decreased, while this value for the HER onset changes oppositely. At an equilibrium potential of 0.7 V, the decoupled HER and OER can be driven at close voltages of only 0.75 V. We note that it is important to get the cell voltage balanced during the decoupled water splitting, which has the benefit of utilizing the same power supply for both OER and HER by simply switching the power polarity.

(D) Decoupled OER and (E) HER driven by a commercial Si solar cell. 
The decoupled water splitting performance was also investigated by chronopotentiometry measurements. As shown in Fig. 4C, at a PANI equilibrium potential of 0.4 V, it requires a cell voltage of 0.55 V for reaching an HER current of 5 mA (0.025 A g−1) at PANI‖Pt and 1.32 V for the OER at RuO2/IrO2‖PANI. In contrast, by increasing the equilibrium potential of PANI to 0.7 V, the HER and OER processes require close cell voltages of 0.8 V to reach the same current. This result indicates further that the applied voltage for the decoupled HER and OER can be regulated by controlling the equilibrium potential of PANI. Consequently, the overall water splitting can be realized with a power supply of only 0.8 V by two-step inputs. Such balanced, low cell voltages for decoupling water splitting have not been achieved in earlier studies.23
To examine the practicability of the system, a commercial Si solar cell of ∼1.0 V under natural sunshine was employed as the power source to decouple the OER and HER using RuO2/IrO2‖PANI‖Pt. With the assistance of the PANI electrode, the intermediary electrode can store protons and electrons generated during the OER process and release protons and electrons during the HER process. As shown in Fig. 4D, E and S9,† the OER and HER processes can be sequentially driven by the solar cell, as evidenced by vigorous gas bubbles at both RuO2/IrO2 and Pt electrodes. By contrast, in the absence of the intermediary PANI electrode, water splitting is hardly achieved by a commercial alkaline zinc-manganese dioxide dry battery of ∼1.5 V by simply combining the RuO2/IrO2 anode and Pt cathode (RuO2/IrO2‖Pt), as shown in Fig. S10.†
The decoupled HER and OER can also be carried out concurrently in separate compartments with the assistance of the intermediary PANI electrodes, as shown in Fig. S11.† In this configuration, the oxidative and reductive equivalents were stored in different PANI electrodes, respectively. After the PANI electrode in the cathode compartment is oxidized and the PANI electrode in the anode compartment is reduced, the two solid-state intermediary electrodes can be exchanged between the cathode and anode compartments that reverses the reactions in these two intermediary electrodes. As shown by the chronopotentiometric curves in Fig. S11D,† this implementation allows the decoupled HER and OER to occur concurrently and continuously in separate compartments during the electrolysis of water.24
3. Conclusions
In summary, we introduce a low-cost polyaniline electrode as a solid-state redox mediator for decoupling H2 and O2 production in acidic water electrolysis. The polyaniline electrode exhibits a reversible discharge capacity of 125 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. In addition, by simply regulating the equilibrium potential of the PANI redox mediator, the decoupled HER and OER can be sequentially driven by cell voltages of only 0.8 V, conquering the single high voltage required for the overall water splitting reaction in the conventional electrolyzer. The features of PANI as the redox mediator are remarkable and should lead to more convenient and competitive routes for decoupling production of renewable fuels of high purity. Along this line, earlier studies on PANI as the electrode material for batteries and capacitors would be of great help for further development of the PANI-decoupled water splitting system.
