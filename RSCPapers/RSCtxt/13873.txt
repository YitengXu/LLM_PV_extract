    , Accepted 25th August 2017First published on 25th August 2017AbstractThis study reports on the design and synthesis of an unsymmetrical π-conjugated organic molecule composed of perylene diimide, thienyl diketopyrrolopyrrole, and indoloquinoxaline pieced together using direct heteroarylation. This material demonstrates unprecedented response in the thin-film upon post-deposition solvent vapor annealing, resulting in dramatic red-shifts in optical absorption. Such changes were utilized to enhance photocurrent generation in P3HT based organic solar cells.
Organic π-conjugated molecules and polymers are fascinating chemical species as their structure can be tuned to induce changes in physical, optical, and electronic properties. Indeed, such materials have been used to great effect as active layer components in organic solar cells (OSCs).1,2 By tailoring properties of both donor and acceptor components, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been driven to 12% in recent years.3–6 One of the most studied areas has been the spectral matching of the donor and acceptor to ensure complementary optical absorption profiles to maximize photon harvesting. In this regard, the donor/acceptor (D/A) approach and/or the functionalization of dyes are the most common ways to achieve tailored optical absorption.7,8 For OSCs, the clear majority of active layer materials consist of linear regioregular polymers and/or symmetrical D/A type molecules.9–11 Unsymmetrical polymeric and molecular materials are far less studied.12 Roncali has developed simple push–pull molecules for use as donors in OSCs,13,14 Sharma has investigated unsymmetrical molecules based upon dyes for use as donors15 and acceptors,16,17 while Zhan and Yu have disclosed new unsymmetrical diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) donors and have summarized efforts in this area nicely.18
Recent efforts in our group focused on fullerene-free OSCs has led to the development of a series of N-annulated perylene diimide electron acceptors that can be synthesized on multi-gram scale, exhibit high organic solvent solubility, and yield high performance solar cells with open circuit voltages greater than 1 V.19,20 In this contribution, we extend our acceptor design to unsymmetrical molecules and demonstrate a facile synthesis using direct heteroarylation (DHA) methods and unprecedented ‘red shifts’ in optical absorption upon solvent vapour annealing (SVA). Such properties can be utilized effectively to increase photocurrent generation in fullerene-free OCSs.
Materials design and synthesis is shown in Fig. 1. The target molecule (PDI–DPP–IQ, 1) has a π-conjugated structure consisting of N-annulated perylene diimide (PDI), thienyl diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), and indoloquinoxaline (IQ) organic units connected via C–C bonds in a linear fashion. Each organic unit absorbs light in different regions of the visible spectrum (PDI – 400–600 nm, DPP – 425–650 nm, IQ – 300–400 nm) to enable panchromatic absorption, while the electron affinity increases from IQ to DPP to PDI to allow for an energy cascade within the molecule (Fig. S25, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  Design and synthesis of the target unsymmetrical compound 1 (PDI–DPP–IQ). R1 = hexyl, R2 and R3 = octyl. Isolated yields: PDI–DPP (45%) and 1 (85%). 
In addition, molecules containing DPP19 or IQ21 units with linear alkyl side chains are known to undergo structural reorganization in the solid-state upon SVA, thus incorporating both into the same molecule had the expectation of allowing for post-deposition film treatments. All units are proven effective coupling partners in DHA C–C cross-coupling reactions,19,21,22 a reaction that is atom-economical and ideal for the construction of organic functional materials.23 Indeed, the synthesis of 1 was found to be straight forward. Using DHA methods, a 1:1 reaction between PDI and DPP yielded the mono-substituted product PDI–DPP in 45% yield. Further reaction of PDI–DPP with IQ using DHA methods gave the target product 1 in 85% yield. See ESI† for full synthetic details and complete material identification. Compound 1 was found to be highly soluble in common OSC processing solvents, formed uniform films from solution, and exhibited a high thermal stability as a solid (ca. mp. ∼206 °C and dp. ∼400 °C. Fig. S27 and S28, ESI†).
The electrochemical and optical properties of 1 were determined by cyclic voltammetry and UV-Vis spectroscopy, respectively (Fig. 2), with additional insight provided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Compound 1 exhibits stable ambipolar redox behaviour (Fig. 2A). Four reversible reduction waves are observed with E1/2 values of −1.27, −1.49, −1.70, and −1.90 V while two oxidation waves are observed with E1/2 values of 0.47 V and 0.76 V. The two reversible oxidations are likely attributed to DPP while the first two reductions are proposed to be from PDI followed by one reduction from DPP and the final one from IQ. These oxidation and reduction wave assignments are based on the overlaid cyclic voltammograms of 1 and the individual components (Fig. S26, ESI†). Using the onsets of reduction (−1.15 V) and oxidation (0.38 V) and a conversion factor of 4.8 (Fc), the electron affinity (EA) and ionization potential (IP) were estimated to be 3.7 and 5.2 eV, respectively. The assignment of the EA and IP as being a function of the PDI and DPP units, respectively, are further confirmed by evaluation of the frontier molecular orbitals as determined at the OT-ωB97X-D/6-31g(d,p) level of theory, where the lowest-unoccupied and highest-occupied molecular orbitals (LUMO and HOMO, respectively) reside on the PDI and DPP moieties, respectively (Fig. S37, ESI†).

As hypothesized, compound 1 exhibits panchromatic optical absorption (Fig. 2B). In solution, high intensity optical transitions are observed from ∼300–650 nm with a tail extending beyond 700 nm. Maximum absorption occurs from ∼510–560 nm with a peak at ∼535 nm. Time-dependant density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations at the TD-OT-ωB97X-D/6-31g(d,p) level of theory provide excited-state transitions and a simulated absorption spectrum that agree reasonably well with experiment. Analyses of the natural transition orbitals (NTO) reveal that the S0 → S1 transition resides mainly on the DPP moiety, arising from a one-electron transition that is predominantly HOMO → LUMO+1 (Fig. S37 and S38, ESI†). Confirming the panchromatic design paradigm, the mid-energy transitions can be clearly identified as taking place mainly on the PDI moiety (S0 → S2; S0 → S3; S0 → S4; Fig. S39–S41, ESI†), while the higher-energy transitions are associated with the IQ unit (S0 → S7; Fig. S42, ESI†).
A transition from solution to thin film leads to a broadening of the lowest energy absorption band, a red-shift in the onset of absorption, and a levelling of the overall absorption intensity. Importantly, a strong, high-energy absorption band is observed from ∼350–450 nm, attributed to the IQ unit, that is not observed in the related PDI–DPP–PDI compound19 (Fig. S29, ESI†), thus highlighting the spectral engineering strategy to achieve panchromatic absorption.
Organic materials can undergo structural reorganization in the solid-state (film) upon post-film deposition techniques such as thermal annealing (TA) and/or SVA, which can lead to improved performance in electronic devices.24,25 TA of thin-films of 1 resulted in no significant changes in the optical absorption spectrum and only film de-wetting above the compound's melting point (Fig. S30 and S31, ESI†). Use of SVA (o-xylenes; Fig. S32, ESI†) results in a dramatic change. As shown in Fig. 3, a large bathochromic and hyperchromic shift is observed in the lowest energy absorption band from ∼600 to ∼700 nm. A loss in intensity of the peak at ∼535 nm (PDI) occurs while the high-energy band centred at ∼420 nm (IQ) retains its position and intensity but fine structure emerges. Such a dramatic change from primarily ‘blue/green’ absorption to predominantly ‘red’ absorption is unprecedented for PDI/DPP based molecular materials. To better understand this system, we replaced the IQ unit with triphenylamine (compound 2) and benzaldehyde (compound 3) and to our surprise no response to SVA was observed (Fig. S33, ESI†). This clearly points towards the IQ building block being active in the reorganization of 1 upon SVA. Indeed, PDI–DPP–PDI shows only a hypsochromic shift of the lowest energy band upon SVA (Fig. S33, ESI†). Interestingly for 1, changing the alkyl chain on DPP from octyl to 2-ethylhexyl (Compound 4) inhibited molecular reorganization in the solid-state upon SVA treatment with no change in the optical spectrum observed (Fig. S33, ESI†). Shortening the alkyl chain on IQ from octyl to ethyl (Compound 5) results in the same dramatic changes in optical absorption upon SVA from o-xylenes (Fig. S34, ESI†).

Thin-films of 1 pre- and post-SVA were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3). Upon SVA, thin films become crystalline as evident by the emergence of a diffraction peak at ∼5.3° (Fig. 3B). AFM revealed that as-cast films were smooth (Fig. 3C) and that SVA roughened the film and induced the formation of large aggregates (Fig. 3D). Such observations are consistent with the organization of 1 into more ordered domains upon SVA.
To explore the relationship between the changes in film structure and optical characteristics with SVA, further TDDFT calculations were carried out on 1 as a function of (i) the degree of twist within the molecular backbone and (ii) the potential formation of head-to-tail dimers. Fig. 4 presents a comparison of the simulated absorption spectra based on the TDDFT results of the monomer and dimer models of 1. For the optimized monomer of 1, the PDI unit is nearly orthogonal to the DPP moiety, with a twist angle of ∼81°. Consideration of a dimer of 1 where the optimized geometry of the isolated molecule is maintained reveals that the low-energy absorption band is comprised of two electronic transitions at nearly the same energy as that of the isolated molecule; the hole and electron NTO for these transitions are localized on only one of the two molecules in the dimer (Fig. S45 and S46, ESI†). Hence, simple aggregation without a change in molecular configuration cannot fully explain the presence of the low-energy optical transitions that appear with SVA. When 1 is considered to reorganize to a planar configuration, however, the molecular S0 → S1 transition moves to lower energy (by 0.24 eV) when compared to the optimized structure, and the oscillator strength increases modestly (Tables S5 and S7, ESI†). These results are consistent with the expectation that the π electrons are more delocalized in the planar configuration; inspection of the NTO for the S0 → S1 transition of a planar configuration of 1 (Fig. S48, ESI†) shows that the hole and electron are more delocalized, extending on to the PDI, when compared to the optimized structure. Consideration of a dimer model composed of planar 1 results in a modest red shift of the first low-energy transition with appreciable oscillator strength (by 0.05 eV, Table S8, ESI†) when compared to the isolated, planar 1. For this dimer, the S0 → S1 transition is forbidden (some 0.20 eV lower in energy than the S0 → S1 transition for isolated, planar 1), and it is the S0 → S2 and S0 → S4 transitions that are mainly responsible for the observed low-energy band with increased oscillator strength when compared to isolated 1 in both the twisted and planar conformations. NTO for the planar dimer S0 → S2 transition show that both the hole and electron reside mainly on the DPP and PDI moieties (Fig. S51, ESI†) of both molecules in the dimer. From these models, it is apparent that both reorganization of 1 to a planar configuration and/or the formation of aggregates of such planar molecules can lead to the experimentally observed low-energy optical transitions that appear after SVA. While this analysis includes only a few possibilities concerning molecular reorganization and aggregation, it reveals how the consideration of such geometric transformations and post-processing procedures can be accounted for during molecular design stage.

To capitalize on this phenomenon, we fabricated proof-of-concept bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSC devices using the wide-band gap donor P3HT.26 P3HT only absorbs light out to ∼600 nm and would benefit from the significant absorption in the red from 1 after SVA treatment. OSCs were fabricated and tested in air using the inverted architecture ITO/ZnO/BHJ/MoOx/Ag. The BHJ was subjected to SVA with o-xylenes prior to electrode deposition. Full details on device fabrication, optimization, and testing can be found in the ESI.† Best films were cast from 1:3 P3HT:1 blend solutions, from chloroform, and had a thickness of ∼115–120 nm. The optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) of blended films is shown in Fig. 5. The UV-vis spectra of as-cast versus SVA films, show a significant increase in the low energy absorption upon SVA treatment. In all cases, efficient PL quenching of the donor polymer by 1 is observed. For P3HT:1 base devices, the OSCs with as-cast active layers had respectable open-circuit voltage (Voc) of ∼0.8 V but overall had low performance. Upon SVA treatment, a near 8-fold increase in PCE was realized, a Voc of 0.8 V maintained, and most significantly, equal photocurrent generation was observed from 400–750 nm (see Table S2 for tabulated data, ESI†). Analysis of the BHJ film by AFM showed a roughening of the film and increase in phase separation upon SVA treatment (Fig. S36, ESI†). The emergence of larger and more well-defined domains is favourable for charge extraction. This has previously been shown for molecular BHJ systems treated with SVA.27

In conclusion, we report on the design and synthesis of an unsymmetrical non-fullerene acceptor via direct heteroarylation with panchromatic optical absorption. The molecule contains both PDI and DPP fragments ensuring strong visible light absorption and high electron affinity. The use of an indoloquinoxaline building block on the terminus provides absorption in the blue and facilitates reorganization of the molecule in the solid-state via SVA. This reorganization results in unprecedented ‘red-shifts’ in the optical absorption spectrum attributed to a planarization of the molecular backbone and a head-to-tail stacking. Such changes are useful for photo-current generation in P3HT based solar cells. Finally, this study highlights that the ‘unsymmetrical design’ is an effective strategy to achieve unique materials properties and will be an important paradigm for future materials development in the space of organic electronics to further improve device performance.
