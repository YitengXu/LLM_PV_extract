    , Accepted 3rd September 2015First published on 3rd September 2015AbstractWe investigated an effect of Ag(I)-substitution at the Cu sites in CuGaS2 with a chalcopyrite structure on physicochemical, photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical properties. Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–0.8) solid solutions possessed 2.34–2.35 eV of band gaps. Ru-loaded Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–1.0) powders showed photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution from an aqueous solution containing SO32− and S2− as electron donors under simulated sunlight irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of CuGaS2 (x = 0) was improved, when excess Ga2S3 was added in a starting material for the preparation to give a single phase of a chalcopyrite structure. Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0.1–1.0) showed higher activity than the CuGaS2 (x = 0), when prepared with the optimum excess Ga2S3. Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–0.8) electrodes gave cathodic photocurrents under visible light irradiation, indicating that they possessed p-type characters. Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 gave the largest cathodic photocurrent and possessed the most positive onset potential of the cathodic photocurrent among the Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–0.8) electrodes. Loading a Ru cocatalyst increased the cathodic photocurrent. Solar water splitting proceeded without an external bias using a photoelectrochemical cell consisting of the Ru-loaded Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 photocathode and a CoO-loaded BiVO4 photoanode. Thus, the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performances of CuGaS2 were improved by Ag(I)-substitution at the Cu sites.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting has been extensively studied since the discovery of the Honda–Fujishima effect using a TiO2 photoelectrode.1 Various oxides and oxy-nitrides have been reported as powdered photocatalysts for water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen under UV and visible light irradiation.2–4 Visible-light-responsive photoelectrodes such as WO3,5–7 BiVO4,8–15 Fe2O3,16,17 TaON,18 BaTaO2N,19 and Cu(I)-containing metal chalcogenides20–24 have also attracted attention as a photocathode and a photoanode.
Metal sulfides are promising materials from the viewpoint of utilizing sunlight,3,25 because they possess relatively narrow band gaps compared with those of metal oxides due to a high level of valence band maxima formed by S 3p orbitals. We have developed many kinds of visible-light-driven metal sulfide photocatalysts.3 Although metal sulfide photocatalysts can reduce water to hydrogen effectively in the presence of electron donors, these photocatalysts cannot split water into hydrogen and oxygen by one-step excitation because of photocorrosion. However, water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen can be achieved by using the metal sulfide as a hydrogen-evolving photocatalyst of a Z-scheme system and a photocathode of a photoelectrochemical cell.26–28 Thus, development of metal sulfide photocatalysts gives important information on the design of visible-light-responsive photocatalysts and contributes to the construction of systems for solar water splitting.
Formation of a solid solution is an effective strategy to develop highly active metal sulfide photocatalysts.3 We successfully developed visible-light-driven metal sulfide photocatalysts such as ZnS–CuInS2–AgInS229–32 and ZnS-CuGaS227 with a chalcopyrite structure on the basis of band engineering by making solid solutions. Zn1−2x(CuGa)xGa2S4 solid solutions with a defective chalcopyrite structure also show photocatalytic activity for sacrificial hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation.33 The photocatalytic property of a solid solution strongly depends on its composition. In general, the band gap of a solid solution monotonically changes with the composition.29–31,33 However, solid solutions between Cu(I)- and Ag(I)-containing metal sulfides often exhibit unique behaviors against the general rule.34 For instance, a CuAgZnSnS4 solid solution between Cu2ZnSnS4 (BG 1.4 eV) and Ag2ZnSnS4 (BG 2.0 eV) possesses the same band gap as that of Cu2ZnSnS4.35 Moreover, ZnS–CuInS2–AgInS2 solid solutions at certain compositions possess narrower band gaps than those of ZnS–AgInS2 and ZnS–CuInS2 solid solutions.32 The CuAgZnSnS4 and ZnS–CuInS2–AgInS2 solid solutions show higher photocatalytic activities than Cu2ZnSnS4 and ZnS-MInS2 (M = Cu and Ag), respectively. These unique behaviors including positive effects on the band structure and photocatalytic activity are caused by a change in the valence band characters due to the interaction of Cu 3d with Ag 4d orbitals. A positive effect of the substitution of small amounts of Ag(I) ions at Cu(I) sites on a photoelectrochemical property has also been observed.36 Therefore, Ag(I)-substitution for Cu(I)-containing photocatalysts is expected to be an effective method for improving photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical properties.
As a Cu(I)-containing photocatalyst, CuGaS2 with a chalcopyrite structure is an excellent photofunctional material, because it can be employed as a hydrogen-evolving photocatalyst of a Z-scheme system and a photocathode of a photoelectrochemical cell for water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen of an energy conversion reaction under simulated sunlight irradiation.26,28 Moreover, solid solutions between CuGaS2 and ZnS show high photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performances compared with CuGaS2.27,37 Therefore, making solid solutions based on CuGaS2 will lead to the development of new photocatalysts and photoelectrodes with excellent performances.
Fabrication of photoelectrodes is an important key factor affecting photoelectrochemical performances. Highly efficient chalcogenide photoelectrodes including CuIn1−xGaxS2,24 Cu2ZnSnS4,22 CuIn1−xGaxSe2,21 and their related materials20,23 with a p-type character were usually fabricated by complex processes such as co-evaporation, sulfurization and selenization for chalcogenide film deposition, and subsequent formation of n-type compound surface layers and loading cocatalysts in an electrolyte containing noble metal ions. In contrast, pasting photocatalyst powders on a substrate electrode is a relatively facile method, which is favorable for the large-scale fabrication of photoelectrodes.
In the present study, we have developed active powdered photocatalysts by substituting Ag(I) at the Cu(I) sites of CuGaS2 with a chalcopyrite structure. Then, the developed powders were applied to photoelectrodes by a facile fabrication method to achieve photoelectrochemical water splitting under simulated sunlight irradiation.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation and characterization of photocatalyst powders
Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–1.0) was prepared by a solid-state reaction. Starting materials of Cu2S (Kojundo Chemical; 99%), Ag2S (Rare Metallic; 99.9%) and Ga2S3 (Kojundo Chemical; 99.99%) were mixed with a planetary ball mill (FRITSCH; pulverisette 7) using ZrO2 balls with distilled water for 20 minutes. Excess Ga2S3 was added to obtain a single phase of a chalcopyrite structure, if necessary. The mixture was sealed in a quartz ampoule tube after evacuation and was heat-treated at 1073 K for 10 h. Crystal structures of prepared metal sulfides were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (Rigaku; MiniFlex). The bulk compositions of metal sulfides were determined using X-ray fluorescence (PANalytical; Epsilon5). Morphologies were observed by scanning electron microscopy (JEOL; JSM-6700F). Diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained with a UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer with an integrating sphere (Jasco; UbestV-570) and were converted from reflectance to absorbance by the Kubelka-Munk method. The chemical states of loaded Ru were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (JEOL; JPS-9010MC).
2.2. Photocatalytic reactions
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was conducted in a closed gas circulation system connecting a top-irradiation cell with a Pyrex window. A photocatalyst powder (0.2 g) was dispersed in an aqueous solution (150 mL) containing K2SO3 and Na2S as electron donors. The photocatalyst was irradiated with simulated sunlight using a solar simulator with an AM 1.5 filter (SAN-EI ELECTRIC; XES-40 S1). Ru-cocatalysts were photodeposited on the photocatalysts in situ in an aqueous solution dissolving RuCl3·nH2O (Wako: 99.9%) as a source of the cocatalyst and K2SO3 and Na2S as electron donors. The amount of evolved hydrogen was determined by on-line gas chromatography (Shimazu; GC-8A, MS-5A column, TCD, Ar carrier).
2.3. Photoelectrochemical measurement
Photocatalyst electrodes were prepared by a squeegee method. 20 mg of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 photocatalyst powder and 20 μL of acetylacetone (Kanto Chemical; 99.5%) were mixed in an agate mortar. Then, 20 μL of distilled water was added after the acetylacetone evaporated. The photocatalyst powder/water paste was applied to a transparent ITO substrate, and then the substrate was heat-treated at 573 K for 2 h in N2. An aqueous solution dissolving a desired amount of RuCl3·nH2O was mixed with the photocatalyst powder/water paste. The mixture was applied to an ITO substrate and was subsequently heat-treated at 573 K for 2 h in N2. Photoelectrochemical properties were evaluated using a potentiostat (Hokuto Denko; HZ-7000) with an H-type cell. A working electrode was separated from a counter electrode with Nafion (Dupon; Nafion 117N). Pt and saturated Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous K2SO4 (Kanto Chemical; 99.0%) solution was employed as an electrolyte. If necessary, an aqueous phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.9) containing 0.025 mol L−1 KH2PO4 (Kanto Chemical; 99.6%) and 0.025 mol L−1 Na2HPO4 (Kanto Chemical; 99.5%) was used. The photoelectrodes were irradiated with visible light (λ > 420 nm) through a cut-off filter (Hoya; L42) from a 300 W Xe-arc lamp (Perkin Elmer; CERMAX-PE300F). Nitrogen or argon gas was bubbled in electrolytes in anodic and cathodic compartments to remove dissolved oxygen. Amounts of evolved hydrogen and oxygen by photoelectrochemical water splitting were determined with an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimazu; GC-8A, MS-5A column, TCD, Ar carrier) connected with an Ar-flow system. Incident photon to photocurrent efficiencies (IPCEs) defined by eqn (1) were measured using band-pass filters (Asahi Spectra) and a 300 W Xe-arc lamp (Asahi Spectra; MAX-301). The photon flux of the monochromatic light was measured with a silicon photodiode (OPHIRA; PD300-UV of a head and NOVA of a power monitor). Solar energy conversion efficiency defined by eqn (2) was measured using a solar simulator with an air mass 1.5 filter (Asahi spectra; HAL-320). (1) (2)
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Optimization of the excess Ga2S3 in preparation of CuGaS2, AgGaS2 and their solid solutions with a single phase of a chalcopyrite structure
To evaluate the potential of CuGaS2, AgGaS2 and their solid solutions, we tried to prepare a single phase of the samples with a chalcopyrite structure. Excess Ga2S3 in the preparation of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–1.0) was investigated to obtain a single phase of a chalcopyrite structure with less lattice defects. XRD patterns and diffuse reflectance spectra were used to decide the formation of a single phase.
Elemental analysis using XRF revealed that the CuGaS2 samples prepared with 10% and 20% excess Ga2S3 contained 1.1 and 1.2 times Ga, respectively, compared with that of the CuGaS2 prepared without excess Ga2S3. CuGaS2 prepared without excess Ga2S3 (stoichiometric amount) possessed a risen baseline in diffuse reflectance spectra due to Cu2S (Fig. S1a and e†), while its XRD pattern seemed a single phase of a chalcopyrite structure (Fig. S2a†). CuGaS2 prepared with 10% excess Ga2S3 also showed small absorption bands at around 700 nm and 1000 nm in addition to the band gap absorption (Fig. S1b†). The risen baseline and additional absorption bands were not observed, when CuGaS2 samples were prepared with 20% and 30% excess Ga2S3 (Fig. S1c and d†). However, CuGaS2 prepared with 30% excess Ga2S3 showed a small shoulder peak at 29.5° derived from an impurity phase in the XRD pattern (Fig. S2d†). Thus, 20% excess Ga2S3 was the optimum for CuGaS2, judging from the XRD patterns and diffuse reflectance spectra. The optimum excess Ga2S3 for AgGaS2 was also decided to be 20% in the same manner (Fig. S3 and S4†).
Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 was employed as a typical composition of solid solutions. Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 prepared without and with 5% excess Ga2S3 possessed a risen baseline and an additional absorption band due to Cu2S and Ag2S in the diffuse reflectance spectra, judging from the absorption profiles of Cu2S and Ag2S (Fig. S5†). The risen baseline and additional absorption band disappeared by addition of 10% and 20% excess Ga2S3. Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 prepared with 20% excess Ga2S3 showed a small additional peak at 28° derived from an impurity phase in the XRD pattern (Fig. S6†). Thus, the optimum excess Ga2S3 for Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 was decided to be 10%. Accordingly, solid solutions were prepared with 10% excess Ga2S3.
3.2. Synthesis and characterization of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–1.0)

Fig. 1 shows X-ray diffraction patterns of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–1.0). Cu1−xAgxGaS2 with a chalcopyrite structure was obtained in x = 0–0.2 and 0.8–1.0. The diffraction peaks monotonically shifted to a lower angle with an increase in the values of x. The peak shifts agreed with the larger ionic radii of Ag+ (1.00 Å) than that of Cu+ (0.60 Å), indicating the successful formation of solid solutions. In contrast, diffraction peaks of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0.3 and 0.7) hardly shifted compared with those of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0.2 and 0.8), respectively, indicating that mixed phases were obtained in Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0.3 and 0.7). Splits between (220) and (024) peaks, and (312) and (116) peaks monotonically became large with an increase in the value of x in x = 0–0.2 and 0.8–1.0, meaning that asymmetry of the crystal structure became large when the value of x increased. Lattice parameters and cell volumes of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 were calculated to investigate the detailed change in their crystal structures, as shown in Fig. 2. When the value of x increased in x = 0–0.2 and 0.8–1.0, the cell volumes linearly increased in good agreement with Vegard's law. In contrast, the cell volumes of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0.3 and 0.7) hardly change compared with those of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0.2 and 0.8). Thus, the successful formation of solid solutions in the range of x = 0–0.2 and 0.8–1.0 was confirmed. In addition, the value of c/a of the tetragonal deformation was deviated from 2, when the value of x increased. This change agreed with widening the splits of peaks in Fig. 1.

Fig. 3 shows SEM images of CuGaS2 prepared with 0, 10 and 20% excess Ga2S3, Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.8) solid solutions prepared with 10% excess Ga2S3 and AgGaS2 prepared with 20% excess Ga2S3. The particle size of CuGaS2 prepared without excess Ga2S3 was about 3 μm (Fig. 3a). The particle size decreased with an increase in the excess Ga2S3, as shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c). AgGaS2 prepared with 20% excess Ga2S3 also possessed a small particle size similar to that of CuGaS2 with 20% excess Ga2S3 (Fig. 3c and g). It has been reported that an increase in a Ga(III) content decreases the particle sizes of CuGaxIn1−xSe2 with a chalcopyrite structure.38 Therefore, the decrease in the particle sizes of CuGaS2 shown in Fig. 3a–c might also be due to large amounts of Ga(III), as observed for CuGaxIn1−xSe2. The particle sizes of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–0.8) prepared with 10% excess Ga2S3 were about 1 μm. Thus, Ag(I)-substitution for CuGaS2 does not affect the morphology, whereas the asymmetry of the crystal structure becomes large on the basis of XRD and SEM measurements, as shown in Fig. 1 and 3.

3.3. Band structures of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–1.0)

Fig. 4(i) shows diffuse reflectance spectra of Cu1−xAgxGaS2. The absorption edges of CuGaS2 and AgGaS2 located at around 530 nm and 480 nm, giving 2.35 eV and 2.61 eV of band gaps, respectively. This is because the Ag 4d orbital formed a lower valence band maximum than that of Cu 3d orbitals, as observed for other Cu(I)- and Ag(I)-containing metal sulfide photocatalysts.32,35,39 The absorption edges of Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 and Cu0.2Ag0.8GaS2 were located at almost the same position as that of CuGaS2. In general, the absorption edge of the solid solution should shift with the composition.29–31 However, this rule cannot often be applied to metal sulfides containing both Cu(I) and Ag(I)34 such as a CuAgZnSnS4 solid solution.35 It might be due to the interaction between Cu 3d and Ag 4d orbitals for widening the valence band. CuGaS2 possessed the valence band with split potential distribution, while AgGaS2 possessed the valence band with wide potential distribution.40 Therefore, the substitution of Ag(I) for CuGaS2 will provide the valence band with wide potential distribution. Moreover, the absorption edge of Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 was steeper than that of CuGaS2, indicating the change in the valence band state by the interaction between Cu(I) and Ag(I). In other words, the density of states and the continuousness of the valence band increased by hybridization of S 3p, Cu 3d and Ag 4d orbitals.

Fig. 4(ii) summarizes the band structures estimated from the diffuse reflectance spectra shown in Fig. 4(i). The band gaps were estimated from the absorption edges of diffuse reflectance spectra. The band positions were expressed as relative relations among the samples. The valence band maximum of CuGaS2 became deep (positive) by increasing the rate of Ag(I)-substitution, because the Ag 4d orbital formed the lower valence band maximum than Cu 3d orbital as mentioned above. Although Ga 4s4p orbitals formed the conduction band minimum for all samples, the level became deep by increasing the rate of Ag(I)-substitution, because the lattice constants became large.34 Similar positive shifts in the conduction and valence band levels by Ag(I)-substitution at Cu-sites were also observed for CuGaSe2 with the same chalcopyrite structure.41 Thus, Ag(I)-substitution affected not only the valence band level but also the conduction band level.
3.4. Photocatalytic properties of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–1.0) under simulated sunlight irradiation

Table 1 and Fig. 5 show photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from an aqueous solution containing SO32− and S2− as electron donors using Ru-loaded Cu1−xAgxGaS2 under simulated sunlight irradiation. The fastest rate of hydrogen evolution estimated from Fig. 5 is presented in Table 1 for each sample. Ru-loaded Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–1) showed photocatalytic activity for solar hydrogen evolution. The CuGaS2 prepared with 20% excess Ga2S3 (entries 3) showed much higher activity than CuGaS2 prepared without and with 10% excess Ga2S3 (entries 1 and 2). Thus, the CuGaS2 prepared with the optimum excess Ga2S3 of 20% showed higher activity than those of other CuGaS2 samples prepared without and with 10% excess Ga2S3. AgGaS2 (entry 7) showed the highest photocatalytic activity among the samples of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–1) as previously reported.42 The photocatalytic activities of Cu0.9Ag0.1GaS2, Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 and Cu0.2Ag0.8GaS2 solid solutions were higher than those of CuGaS2 (entries 3–6) in spite of the fact that the solid solutions possessed band gaps and morphologies similar to that of CuGaS2. Accordingly, this difference in photocatalytic activities might be due to the difference in band structures. The density of state and the continuousness of the valence band of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.8) increased by hybridization of S 3p, Cu 3d and Ag 4d orbitals, resulting in an increase in the mobility of holes in the valence band compared with that of CuGaS2. The effects of Ag(I)-substitution on the photocatalytic performance of Cu(I)-containing metal sulfide photocatalysts such as ZnS–CuInS2–AgInS2 and CuAgZnSnS4 solid solutions have also been reported.32,35 Ru(1.0 wt%)-loaded CuGaS2 and Cu0.9Ag0.1GaS2 showed stable activities for hydrogen evolution after an induction period, as shown in Fig. 5(i). In contrast, although Ru(1.0 wt%)-loaded Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2, Cu0.2Ag0.8GaS2 and AgGaS2 showed high activities, they were deactivated, as shown in Fig. 5(ii). This deactivation was probably due to the reduction of Ag+ near the surface by photogenerated electrons and/or the formation of Ag2S on the surface, as observed for other metal sulfide photocatalysts containing Ag(I).39

3.5. Photoelectrochemical properties of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–1.0) under visible light irradiation
The developed Cu1−xAgxGaS2 photocatalyst powders were pasted on an ITO substrate to evaluate their photoelectrochemical properties, as shown in Fig. 6. Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–0.8) gave cathodic photocurrents under visible light irradiation showing p-type characters, whereas AgGaS2 behaved like an intrinsic semiconductor. The compounds consisting of Cu(I) such as CuIn1−xGaxSe2, CuIn1−xGaxS2 and Cu2ZnSnS4 possess a p-type character, because Cu(I) vacancies (VCu) with a small formation energy function as acceptor carriers. The p-type character of Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–0.8) was also probably due to VCu. The onset potential of the cathodic photocurrent of CuGaS2 shifted positively by Ag(I)-substitution. This shift is probably due to the positive shift in the valence band maximum of CuGaS2 by Ag(I)-substitution at Cu-sites, as shown in Fig. 4(ii). Similar positive shifts of the onsets were observed for Ag(I)-substituted CuGaSe2 photocathodes.36 Another possible explanation for the positive shift of the onset potential will be the difference in the carrier density between Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 and CuGaS2. An increase in the number of acceptor carriers in a p-type semiconductor makes the Fermi level close to the top of a valence band, resulting in the formation of the lower Fermi level. In contrast, donor carriers degrade the p-type character of the semiconductor by forming a donor–acceptor pair. Wada et al. have reported that the formation energy of VSe which is an anion vacancy working as the donor in AgInSe2 was larger than that in CuInSe2.43 Ag(I)-substitution at Cu-sites of CuGaS2 might suppress the formation of donor carriers such as VS, resulting in a low Fermi level. It results in giving a more positive onset potential for the cathodic photocurrent.

Electrolyte, 0.1 mol L−1 K2SO4 aqueous solution (phosphate buffer, pH 6.9); light source, a 300 W Xe lamp with a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm); sweep rate, 20 mV s−1. Photocatalysts (a) and (e) and photocatalysts (b)–(d) were prepared with 20% and 10% excess Ga2S3, respectively. Asterisks indicate onset potentials of cathodic photocurrents. 
Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 showed the highest cathodic photocurrent among Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–0.8) photoelectrodes. In more detail, Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 gave a larger cathodic photocurrent than CuGaS2 at more positively applied potentials around −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. It was due to a more positive onset potential of Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 than that of CuGaS2.
Ru was an effective cocatalyst in sacrificial hydrogen evolution on powdered photocatalysts, as shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, the Ru-cocatalyst was loaded on the Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 photoelectrode for further improvement of its photoelectrochemical performance. Fig. 7 shows chronoamperometries and current vs. potential curves of Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 and Ru-loaded Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 under visible light irradiation. The current vs. potential curves were measured after chronoamperometric measurement. This is because of an aging effect that was observed as the cathodic photocurrents of Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 increased with light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 7(i). In the case of compound solar cells consisting of chalcopyrite-type semiconductors, the energy conversion efficiencies are also improved with the light irradiation time.44 Ru-loaded Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 gave about a tripled cathodic photocurrent compared with that of a non-loaded electrode at −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl of an applied potential, as shown in Fig. 7(i). It was due to the formation of the active site for hydrogen evolution, resulting in enhancing a surface reaction. Ru-loaded Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 also gave a higher cathodic photocurrent than that of a non-loaded electrode in the current vs. potential curves. Thus, Ru-loaded Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 for which the preparation does not require complex fabrication processes such as co-evaporation, sulfurization and selenization and formation of an n-type compound layer is an excellent photocathode with a positive onset potential.

Fig. 8 shows action spectra of the Ru-loaded Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 photocathode at different applied potentials. The onsets of action spectra at different applied potentials agreed with the absorption spectrum of Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2, indicating that the cathodic photocurrent was due to the band gap excitation of Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2. Ru-loaded Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 gave IPCEs of 9.0, 7.7 and 4.6% at 480 nm under −0.6, −0.4 and −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl of applied potentials, respectively.

As mentioned above and as shown in Fig. 5 and 7, Ru cocatalysts played an important role as reaction sites for water reduction to form H2 in photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical reactions. We tried to evaluate the chemical states of Ru cocatalysts on the powdered photocatalyst and photocathode by XPS measurement (Fig. S7†). The Ru 3d5/2 peak in Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 with RuCl3 was located at around 282 eV. In contrast, the Ru 3d5/2 peaks in the Ru-loaded Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 powder and photocathode after the reactions were located at around 281 eV. It has been reported that the positions of Ru 3d5/2 peaks in RuCl3 and RuO2 were around 281–282 eV, while those in RuS2 and metallic Ru were around 280 eV.45–47 The observed shift toward a lower binding energy after the reactions indicated that a part of Ru was loaded as metallic Ru and/or sulfurated Ru.
3.6. Water splitting using a Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 photocathode
We have previously developed water splitting systems using a metal sulfide photocatalyst as a hydrogen-evolving photocatalyst of a Z-scheme system and a photocathode of a photoelectrochemical cell.26–28 According to these studies, we have applied the Ru-loaded Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 photocathode to the photoelectrochemical cell.
Gas detection was carried out to confirm that a photocurrent was used for water reduction to hydrogen over the Ru-loaded Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 photoelectrode. Fig. 9 shows an observed photocurrent at −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl and correspondingly evolved hydrogen. Evolved oxygen from a Pt counter electrode was also plotted as a reference. A stable photocurrent was observed for 12 h under visible light irradiation after an induction period due to an aging effect, as shown in Fig. 9(i), giving almost stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen and oxygen. The amount of evolved hydrogen was similar to the half amount of photogenerated electrons, as shown in Fig. 9(ii). This result indicates that the photocurrent was used for hydrogen evolution without remarkable photocorrosion of the Ru-loaded Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 photocathode. We demonstrated photoelectrochemical water splitting combining the Ru-loaded Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 photocathode with a CoO-loaded BiVO4 photoanode in a one-pot cell without an externally applied bias. Fig. 10 shows a photocurrent and correspondingly evolved H2 under simulated sunlight irradiation. The stable photocurrent was obtained under simulated sunlight irradiation for the reaction time longer than 15 h and the amount of evolved hydrogen agreed with the photocurrent, indicating that water splitting of an energy conversion reaction proceeded. The solar energy conversion efficiency was estimated to be 0.005%. Thus, a Ru-loaded Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 electrode fabricated by a relatively facile method worked as a photocathode for a solar energy conversion reaction.

4. Conclusions
The suitable excess Ga2S3 in preparation was important to obtain the single phase of chalcopyrite Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–1) with high photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performances. The effects of Ag(I)-substitution at the Cu-sites of CuGaS2 on photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical properties and band structures were investigated systematically. Band gaps of Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 and Cu0.2Ag0.8GaS2 were similar to that of CuGaS2, whilst the conduction and valence band levels shifted positively by Ag(I)-substitution. The solid solutions showed higher hydrogen evolution activities than CuGaS2 due to the improved mobility of holes at the valence bands consisting of Cu 3d and Ag 4d orbitals. Cu1−xAgxGaS2 (x = 0–0.8) electrodes gave cathodic photocurrents under visible light irradiation showing p-type characters, whereas AgGaS2 behaved as an intrinsic semiconductor. Ru-loaded Cu0.8Ag0.2GaS2 exhibited the most excellent photoelectrochemical performance, judging from the onset potential and the cathodic photocurrent. Thus, we found that the Ag(I)-substitution at Cu sites increased the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performances of CuGaS2. Ag(I)-substitution for Cu(I)-based sulfide photocatalysts will be suitable band engineering for improvement of their photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical properties.
