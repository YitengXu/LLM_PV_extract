    , Accepted 20th December 2012First published on 4th January 2013AbstractElectrical characteristics of p-, n-GaN/graphene junctions before and after nitric acid doping have been investigated. Acid treatment can significantly improve the junction conductance in both cases, which is advantageous for the light emitting diode (LED) to reduce the operating voltage. GaN-based vertical LEDs incorporating graphene as transparent electrodes are further assembled and tested, showing significant improvement in forward electrical characteristics and light output power upon acid modification.
1. Introduction
Graphene is a promising next-generation conducting material with the potential to replace traditional electrode materials such as indium tin oxide (ITO) in many electrical and optical devices, such as solar cells and light emitting diodes (LEDs).1 GaN-based LEDs, a potential candidate for future light sources, have received great development in recent years due to its advantages of low energy consumption, high reliability, no pollution, and long lifespan. GaN-based LEDs using graphene as transparent electrodes have been reported recently2–4 and in these devices graphene coated on p-GaN to form p-GaN/graphene heterojunctions. Vertical structure LEDs (VLEDs) with graphene transparent electrodes have also been reported by our group,5 in which n-GaN/graphene heterojunctions are formed instead. Due to the high work function mismatch between p-, n-GaN and graphene, it is hard to achieve low contact resistance for both p-, n-GaN/graphene heterojunctions, especially for p-GaN with lower carrier concentration. GaN/graphene heterojunction barriers will hinder the movement of carriers, increase the forward operating voltage of LEDs, and weaken the advantage of graphene as a transparent current spreading layer. Previous studies have developed several effective approaches to improve the junction characteristics, especially for p-GaN/graphene, by inserting ITO quantum dots2,6 and metal sheets.3 However, it is still complicated to implement these approaches in large-scale devices. Moreover, there have been few comprehensive studies on the GaN/graphene junction barrier height and contact resistance when LEDs are operated at forward bias.
In this paper, we developed a rational yet feasible approach to improve the electrical characteristics of GaN/graphene junctions by nitric acid doping. GaN/graphene junction barrier heights before and after acid modification are calculated by fitting current–voltage (I–V) curves, and compared with XPS results. A normalized circular transmission line method (CTLM) pattern with the uniform interface area is adopted to obtain the reliable reverse contact resistances of p-, n-GaN/graphene junctions after acid modification. Forward electrical characteristics and light output power of VLEDs further confirm the improvement in performance by acid treatment.
2. Experimental
After dissolving the underlying copper substrate in FeCl3 aqueous solution (1 M), the floating CVD-grown graphene film7 was transferred onto epitaxial p-GaN and n-GaN substrates which were grown on (0001) oriented sapphire substrates by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The p-GaN sample contains unintentionally doped GaN (u-GaN) layer (2 μm) and p-type GaN:Mg layer (0.2 μm) in sequence. The n-GaN sample contains only u-GaN and light doped n-GaN layer. The carrier density characterized by Hall measurements is ∼1.2 × 1018 and 4.5 × 1017 cm−3 for n-GaN and p-GaN, respectively. Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic diagram of the set up for local I–V test of GaN/graphene junctions. Metal layers Ni/Au (10/100 nm) and Cr/Pt/Au (70/40/100 nm) were deposited by electron beam method as contact pads, which could form good ohmic contacts with p-GaN and n-GaN, respectively. Nitric acid (60 wt% AR HNO3) was adopted for graphene doping. I–V curves were recorded with Model LED-632HC LED Tester (Wei Min Industrial Co., Ltd.). The sheet resistance of graphene is ∼2.5–6 kΩ based on the four-probe test.

3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 (b) and (c) show the schematic band structures when graphene contacts with p-GaN and n-GaN. Based on the work function of p-GaN (∼7.5 eV), n-GaN (∼4.1 eV) and graphene (∼4.8 eV), the barrier heights Ψbp and Ψbn can be roughly deduced to be ∼2.7 eV and 0.6 eV, equal to the work function gaps. Typical I–V curves for p-, n-GaN/G junctions are plotted in Fig. 1(d) and (e). Red lines and positive coordinates correspond to forward bias inputs from Probe 2 in both cases. A rectifying behavior similar to a Schottky barrier is observed for p-GaN/G junction under both forward and reverse bias input, yet very linear for n-GaN/G junction, in which the forward input fitting curve exhibits linear characteristics. The barrier height Ψb can be obtained by the least squares method using the equation8 (1)where A is the contact area, A* is the Richardson constant (26.4 A cm−2 K−2 for n-GaN and 96.1 A cm−2 K−2 for p-GaN), Rs is the series resistance and n is the ideality factor. Taking Ψb, Rs and n as fitting parameters, Ψbp and Ψbn can be statistically determined to be 0.49 ± 0.02 and 0.36 ± 0.01 eV, respectively, much lower than the theoretical values deduced above. Rs is determined to be ∼5.8 × 102 and 4.9 × 102 Ω for p-, n-GaN/G, respectively. The abnormal high Rs is attributed to be the metal tip (Ni) contact with graphene. Though Ni could form ohmic contact with graphene,15 the significantly tiny contact area (∼10−4 cm2) results in large Rs (R = ρc/S). The current from the tip will transversely diffuse in graphene films and then transmit to GaN. XPS spectra for bare p-GaN, graphene covered p-GaN, bare n-GaN, and graphene covered n-GaN are shown in Fig. 1(f). The energy peaks correspond to Ecl,p − EF,p, Ecl,p (i), (Ecl,n − Ev,n) + Eg − χn and Ecl,n(i), respectively, as denoted in Fig. 1(b) and (c). Thus Ψbp and Ψbn can be calculated as following: Ψbp = Ecl,p (i) − (Ecl,p − EF,p) + χpΨbn = [(Ecl,n − Ev) + Eg − χn] + Ecl,n(i) + χn(2)

χ
n(χp) is estimated to be ∼0 eV(0.02 eV). Ψbp (Ψbn) can be directly obtained to be about 2.08 eV (=2.06 + 0.02 eV) and 0.57 eV. These values are in between the theoretical values and I–V curve fitting values. This discrepancy could be attributed to the graphene Fermi-level self-adaptive phenomenon9 and the coexistence of multiple carrier transportation mechanisms (thermal emission-diffusion mechanism, tunneling mechanism).
XPS results reveal the true Ψbp and Ψbn. The discrepancy between ΨbT (the superscript T denotes theoretically calculated results) and ΨbX (the superscript X denotes XPS obtained results) is attributed to the graphene Fermi-level self-adaptive phenomenon. For conventional metal-semiconductor junctions, due to the large density of states (DOS), the Fermi level in metal keeps invariant. However, Fermi level in graphene could be obviously shifted by charge carriers transfer because the Fermi level is aligned with Dirac points in neutral single-layer graphene and the DOS vanish exactly at this point (Fig. 1(b) and (c)). It can be calculated that transfer of 0.01 electrons per unit cell would shift the Fermi level by 0.47 eV. When graphene contacts with p-GaN (n-GaN), the holes (electrons) in p-GaN (n-GaN) transport to graphene, bring down (raise up) the Fermi level from the Dirac point to p-type (n-type) semiconductor side, resulting in reduced barrier height. Fermi level shifts in graphene when contacts with p-GaN (n-GaN) can be estimated to be ∼0.62 eV (ΔEF,p = ΨbpT − ΨbpX = 2.7 − 2.08 = 0.62 eV) and 0.13 eV (ΔEF,n = ΨbnT − ΨbnX = 0.7 − 0.57 = 0.13 eV).
The discrepancy between ΨbF (the superscript F denotes I–V curve fitting results) and ΨbX is attributed to the carrier tunneling transport component (IT), whose flow path is in parallel with the thermal emission-diffusion component (ITE,D). So the tested current above (I in eqn (1)) is actually the total current summing ITE,D and IT, that is: I = ITE,D + IT(3)
The eqn (2) should be rewritten as: ITE,D = AA*T2exp(−qΨb/KT)[exp[q(V − IRs)/nkT] − 1](4)
Assuming IT is constant, by combining eqn (1) and (4), it can be conceptually figured out that Ψb obtained in eqn (4) is higher than that obtained in eqn (1), i.e., the ΨbF is actually a counterfeit barrier height. For further consider IT, it also can be can be approximated by an exponential function: (5)where V is the diode voltage, ET is an energy parameter, and I0* is a pre-exponential factor, which is related with the density of states (NT) located in the forbidden gap at the interface or in the space charge zone. Large density of intrinsic dislocations (108/cm), defects in GaN grown on sapphire provide multiple tunneling paths for carrier transport, leading to large fraction of IT component.8 The Ψb variation (ΔΨb) between ΔΨbX and ΔΨbF (ΔΨb = ΔΨbX − ΔΨbF) is more obvious for p-GaN/G junction (ΔΨbp = 2.08 − 0.49 = 1.59 eV) than that for n-GaN/G junction (ΔΨbn = 0.57 − 0.36 = 0.21 eV). This indicates tunneling is more dominant in p-GaN/G junction. As p-GaN is grown at a relatively lower temperature (960 °C) compared with n-GaN (1050 °C), leading to a degraded p-GaN material quality with higher dislocation density, makes it more preferable for carrier tunneling. What is more, the activation percentage of Mg dopant in p-GaN is very low due to the formation of Mg-H complexes. Taking the activation percentage of Mg dopant about 1% after annealing, Mg doping concentration is about 4.5 × 1019 cm−3 in p-GaN, much higher than n-GaN Si doping concentration (1.2 × 1018 cm−3). Higher doping concentration would narrow the depletion width (d = [(2ξξ0(VD − V)/eN)]1/2), greatly decreasing the ET in eqn (5), making IT more notable.
Electrical characteristics of GaN/G junctions are investigated by doping in HNO3 vapor for different times. Fig. 2(e) illustrates the experimental set up. Fig. 2(a)–(d) shows the I–V curves with HNO3 treatments of 5 to 25 min, wherein (a) and (b) are forward and reverse I–V curves for p-GaN/G, (c) and (d) are forward and reverse I–V curves for n-GaN/G. It should be noted that n-GaN/G junction is forward operated when Probe 2 is negatively biased. With the increase of acid doping time, both the forward and reverse currents increase rapidly at the beginning and slowly increase then keep nearly stable after ∼20 min treatment. It is worth noting that the reverse characteristics of n-GaN/G junction exhibit a breakdown immediately after 20 min acid treatment.

(f) Barrier heights for GaN/G junctions before and after acid doping. (g) I–V curves (I in log scale) of n-GaN/G junction at different temperatures. 
Barrier heights Ψb for acid doped junctions have been estimated using the approach mentioned above. As depicted in Fig. 2(f), Ψbp and Ψbn decrease from original values of 0.49 eV (0.36 eV) to 0.44 eV (0.32 eV) after 5 min acid treatment, then saturate to be about 0.41 eV (0.31 eV) with prolonged treatment. The calculated ideality factors (n) are about 12.3 for p-GaN/G and 8.6 for n-GaN/G after acid doping. For an ideal diode, n = 1 (the diffusion-recombination model) or n = 2 (the space charge recombination model), while for non-ideal diodes, n > 2.10 The very high ideal factors for GaN/G junctions could be attributed to the high percentage of IT in both junctions.
The mechanism for the acid induced improvement on GaN/G junctions is discussed below. HNO3 was found to be very effective for p-doping of graphene films by forming a charge-transfer complex through which electrons are transferred from graphene to HNO3, thus resulting in a Fermi level shift to lower energy in graphene.11 Bae, et al. have found that the work functions of graphene films as estimated by UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were blue shifted by ∼130 meV with sufficient HNO3 doping, which provided a direct evidence for the downshift of Fermi level in graphene.11 Based on this effect, HNO3 was further served as a dopant to increase the conversion efficiency of graphene/silicon solar cells.12,13 In our experiment, it is believed such a p-doping effect can increase the work function of graphene, which therefore leads to better performance in conducting, to reduce Ψbp of p-GaN/G junction, the band diagram variation after HNO3 was also shown in Fig. 1(b) (red line). Decreased Ψbp and dscl,p will initiate higher percentage of IT, which results in the further drop of Ψbp. For n-GaN/G junction, p-doing will result in a downshift of Fermi level of graphene to increase Ψbn. This is in conflict with the experimental results obtained above. Considering the pristine lower Ψb and high carriers concentration compared with p-GaN/G, and increased p-doping in graphene will simultaneously narrow the space charge layer width (dscl,n) (d = [(2ξξ0(VD − V)/eN)]1/2) and provides more equivalent energy states for carriers tunneling across, which altogether trigger much higher IT component upon HNO3 treatment. Vice versa, higher IT will bring the fitting obtained ΨbnF down, as discussed above. The band diagram for n-GaN/G junction after HNO3 is also shown in Fig. 1(c) (red line) for comparison. This even triggered a breakdown of the n-GaN/G junction under reverse bias, as reverse bias will further make the band profile steeper and narrow the dscl, as shown in Fig. 2(d). Fig. 2(g) shows the I–V characteristics (I in log scale) of n-GaN/G junction at different temperatures. The current decreases while temperature decreases. This is ascribed to carriers freezing out or capturing by dislocations and defects at low temperature. Another obvious characteristic is that LogI–V curves almost are in parallel with each other with the same slop at (1) and (2) range, respectively. From eqn (5), one can get (6)
The temperature independence of ET parameter is a typical feature of a carrier transport process by tunneling. The invariant slop of LogI–V curve indicates invariant ET at different temperatures, as can be figured out from eqn (6), indicates IT dominates the GaN/G junction I–V characteristics. Assuming ET = nkT and the extracted n above (n = 8.6), ET can be conceptually calculated to be about 223.6 meV, which is consistent with the slop at (1) range. At (2) range, the slop of the I–V curve is calculated to be ∼49.5, and ET is estimated to be ∼20.2 meV. Decreased ET parameter indicates increased IT component, which corresponds to the breakdown of the junction.
The p-, n-GaN/G junctions are both reversely biased when LEDs are operated at forward bias, as illustrated in the band diagrams in Fig. 1(b) and (c). Hence, the reverse contact resistance has a great impact on the operating voltage of LEDs. As shown in Fig. 2(b) and (d), the reverse I–V curve after acid modification shows a linear behavior, indicating the presence of a constant contact resistance. A CTLM pattern with uniform interface area is employed to measure the contact resistance. Fig. 3(a) shows the CTLM test set up, consisting of 100 μm2 ohmic pads with gap spacing of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 μm. Probe 1 is positively (negatively) biased for p-GaN (n-GaN)/G junction to make sure Junction 1 with identified contact area is reversely biased. The metal/graphene contact resistance was calculated to be about 0.9 × 10−5 Ω cm2, which is consistent with previously reported results.14 From the tested total resistance and the linear fitted line as shown in Fig. 3 (b), the reverse contact resistance of acid doped p-GaN/G junction is calculated to be about 2.1 × 10−1 Ω cm2, which is higher than that of the ITO/p-GaN contact (∼5.6 × 10−3 Ω cm2).The reverse contact resistance of acid doped n-GaN/G is calculated to be about 6.05 × 10−5 Ω cm2, calculated from the tested total resistance and the linear fitted line as shown in Fig. 3 (c). To avoid the uncertainty of the CTLM test, multiple tests have been performed. The contact resistances obtained above were obtained by averaging the multiple test results. In the inset of Fig. 3(b), it shows the optical image of one of the tested circular patterns. The specific experimental setup for CTLM test was illustrated in our previous work.15 HNO3 treatment could dramatically reduce the contact resistance of GaN/G junctions and ultimately improve the forward electrical characteristics of LEDs.

It is worthy to note that the electrical characteristics of acid modified GaN/G junctions show obvious degradation after two days air exposure. Fig. 4(a) shows the optical images of the acid modified junction surfaces before and after annealing (120 °C in air). Post annealing yields further degradation at first and then the junction performance remains stable with prolonged annealing, as shown in the I–V curves of p-GaN/G in Fig. 4(b). The aging and annealing process will the cause desorption of HNO3, thus resulting in the degradation of GaN/G junctions. However, with further 40 min annealing, the I–V curve were unchanged, almost overlapping with the curve of 20 min annealing.

VLEDs (1 mm × 1 mm) made by transferring graphene on laser lifted off n-GaN have been fabricated and reported by our group recently.5 The VLEDs were further treated by HNO3 to improve their forward electrical characteristics.16Fig. 5(a) plots the forward I–V curve of VLED with graphene before and after HNO3 modification. Compared with conventional VLED (3.09 V@350 mA, 3.56 V@1000 mA), the forward voltage of VLED with graphene increased (3.36 V@350 mA, 3.80 V@1000 mA). With sufficient HNO3 modification, the forward voltage was reduced to 3.17 V@350 mA, 3.64 V@1000 mA. Fig. 5(b) shows the light output power of VLEDs versus different forward current. Though VLEDs with graphene shows degraded I–V characteristics, the light output power is increased about 34% compared with conventional VLEDs without graphene (at 350 mA forward current). Over 50 chips were tested and all the results show improvement by integrating graphene. This improvement is attributed to improved current distribution with graphene, which is covered on the whole chip area with high transparency and conductivity. The inset of Fig. 5(b) shows the optical image of a VLED with graphene deposited. By further HNO3 treatment, the light output power is further increased by ∼19%.

4. Conclusion
To conclude, electrical characteristics of p-, n-GaN/G junctions before and after acid treatment have been investigated. It was found that HNO3 doping can significantly increase the junction conductance in both cases, which is advantageous for LEDs to reduce the operating voltage. The reverse junction contact resistance for p-GaN (n-GaN)/G is about 2.1 × 10−1 Ω cm2 (6.05 × 10−5 Ω cm2) obtained using CTLM method. Chip test results of VLEDs confirm this acid induced improvement in forward electrical characteristics and light output power.
