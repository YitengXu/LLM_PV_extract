    , Accepted 3rd October 2017First published on 3rd October 2017AbstractAcid-based electrolysis has many advantages, but to achieve simultaneous activity and stability, commercial water oxidation catalysts rely on noble metal oxides that are expensive and too rare for the global scale. Here, earth-abundant tungsten was used as a structural metal to dilute the noble metal iridium content while maintaining high activity and stability in acid. Mixed-metal oxide catalysts were synthesized using rapid plasma oxidation in which the non-equilibrium reaction environment permitted better formation of a homogenous W1−xIrxO3−δ phase. With an Ir metal content as low as 1%, a competitive and durable overpotential for oxygen evolution was achieved. Relative to high Ir content, low Ir compositions consisted of a more highly crystalline, phase-pure iridium polytungstate which was more catalytically active per Ir content. Moreover, the plasma-synthesized material had a sharp electrocatalytic improvement over an equivalent composition synthesized via standard thermal oxidation, demonstrating the value of non-equilibrium synthesis to find new catalysts.

Broader context
Electrochemical fuel production offers a clean route for the energy-dense storage of intermittent renewable electricity and excess electricity that would otherwise be curtailed. Possible fuels include hydrogen from electrolysis, hydrocarbons from carbon dioxide reduction, and even ammonia from nitrogen reduction. For a large-scale and sustainable fuel synthesis technology, water serves as the hydrogen source and must be oxidized at the anode via the oxygen evolution reaction. Water oxidation is a kinetically difficult half-reaction, and thus a highly active catalyst is important to minimize the overpotential and maximize the energy-conversion efficiency. Numerous studies and combinatorial synthesis efforts have pursued improved water oxidation catalysis by testing novel mixed metal oxide compositions. These materials have generally been synthesized by a thermal oxidation route, in which the extended high temperature step often leads to phase segregation into different stable equilibrium compositions. Therefore, most of the alloy composition space is not actually fabricated, possibly bypassing promising catalyst materials. Furthermore, there are many advantages to operating in strongly acidic electrolyte, but the resulting harsh environment severely limits what materials can act as active water oxidation catalysts without prohibitive corrosion. Only rare noble metal oxides like iridium oxide have been simultaneously active and stable in acid.

Introduction
Water-splitting from renewable electricity may be the most promising pathway for carbon-neutral, sustainable H2 production.1–3 The high operating voltage of commercial electrolyzers and corresponding energy loss are largely associated with the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation at the anode.4,5 The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (i.e., 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−, in acid) is a kinetically demanding four-electron redox process with even the best catalysts having an overpotential of ∼300 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a benchmark current density for use in solar water-splitting.6,7 Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, which operate in deionized water with a strongly acidic ionomer membrane, offer a promising way to produce hydrogen of high-grade purity.8,9 The advantages of PEM electrolyzers relative to alkaline-based electrolyzers include greater power density, higher efficiency at lower temperatures, and the availability of well-developed membranes with better ionic conductivity, durability, and tolerance to pressure differences.10 Unfortunately, the high operating potential for the catalyst in the acidic membrane creates a corrosive environment in which only precious metal oxides have exhibited simultaneously high catalytic activity and stability.
Currently, nanoparticle iridium oxide/metallic blends are the main OER catalysts used in PEM electrolyzers.11–14 Other acid-stable catalyst combinations of platinum group metals have been reported, but these metals are exceedingly rare.15 Ir is ∼10000 times less abundant than Ni, Co, or W.16 Even with affordable minimal catalyst loadings, it is unclear if production of these noble metals could be scaled up to meet global energy needs.
A number of effective earth-abundant OER catalysts, including NiFeOx, Co3O4, MnO2, and others,7,17,18 have overpotentials better than IrO2 in alkaline conditions, but none are stable in strongly acidic electrolyte.7,19 Among other stable oxides for acidic OER, PbOx has been studied extensively but to date only moderate to high overpotentials have been reported.20–24 Recently, a F-doped Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 has also shown promise as a water oxidation catalyst in acid.25 Prior catalysis research has also tried to exploit multimetallic oxides with synergistic properties of the component elements, like the modest-overpotential acid-stable (Mn–Co–Ta–Sb)Ox.26 Some efforts have focused on mixed noble and non-noble metal compositions to achieve acid-stable high activity with minimal noble metal content. Ru has been alloyed with Sn, Ir/Sn, and Ir/Ta to provide better acid stability.27–29 IrSnSbOx has shown promise for OER catalysis in acid.30 Ir has also been alloyed in the oxide form with Nb and Sn,31 Mn,32 and Ti33,34 to make active acid-stable catalysts, but each of these studies required 10–40 mol% Ir to be effective.
Testing theoretical predictions of new alloys for OER catalysis requires production of a phase-pure composition, which has often been limited by experimental synthesis techniques. Conventional wet chemical methods such as solution-cast,35 solvothermal,36 Adams' fusion method,37 or sol–gel38 techniques rely on subsequent heating in air to thermally oxidize the material. The prolonged high-temperature oxidation leads to thermodynamic equilibrium, which can cause phase segregation into species other than the originally targeted composition.39 In contrast, oxidation in an oxygen plasma is a rapid (∼1 min) and scalable technique which has been demonstrated to lead to non-equilibrium solid solution phase growth capable of producing homogenous metastable phases.39 Herein we report plasma-oxidized mixed Ir- and W-metal oxide compositions for OER catalysis. W is an earth-abundant metal with an acid-stable oxide (WO3)40 but poor activity for oxygen evolution. A predicted phase diagram of the W–Ir–O system (Fig. S1, ESI†) indicates that there are no stable mixed-metal oxide phases, and thus a mixed W–Ir oxide phase requires a non-equilibrium route such as plasma synthesis to produce. With minimal Ir content, plasma-oxidized W1−xIrxO3−δ was durable in acid with promising OER activity.
Experimental
Catalyst synthesis
Plasma oxidation of the liquid precursors was performed using a homemade upstream (vertical plasma jet) atmospheric microwave plasma flame reactor as described in greater detail in previous work.39 Chemically pure grades of ammonium paratungstate, (NH4)6W12O39·xH2O (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) and iridium acetate, Ir(CH3COO)n (Alfa Aesar, Ir 48–54 wt%), were used as starting materials without further purification. Precursors were dissolved in 18 MΩ cm DI water to a concentration of 0.1 M, and these solutions were mixed as needed to get the desired metal cation stoichiometry in mixed-metal oxide compositions. Subsequently, 0.1 mL of the mixed-metal precursor solution was drop-cast and spread onto 2 cm2 of a fluorine-doped tin-oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate (Hartford Glass, Hartford, CT) which was then exposed to the upstream plasma jet with an input power of 500 W and a volumetric flow of 2 standard liters per minute (slpm) Ar, 11 slpm air, for 90 s to obtain a thin film of catalyst on FTO. The Ar gas was only needed for plasma ignition and was turned off after stable plasma was obtained. The plasma power of 500 W was chosen to prevent degradation of the FTO layer by keeping the substrate temperature <550 °C as determined by a pyrometer. Pure IrO2 and high Ir-content mixed samples adhered well to the FTO substrate, but pure WO3 and low Ir-content mixed samples displayed poor adhesion and flaked off of the substrate after a short period of electrochemical operation. Thus for stability tests, to separate chemical durability from adhesion/delamination issues, mixed-metal oxide catalyst films were scraped off and ball-milled (Desktop Vertical Ball Mill & Mixer with 4 × 1 Liter Nylon Tank-MSK-SFM-2) for ∼16 h to obtain microparticles, which were bound to the electrode surface as described below. Thermally oxidized catalyst samples used the liquid precursor prepared in the same way on an FTO substrate, then placed in a furnace at 500 °C under an air atmosphere for 1 h.
Electrode preparation
FTO–glass and glassy carbon (GC) disks were used as working electrode substrates for the electrochemical measurements due to their high conductivity and poor electrocatalytic activity for OER. Prior to catalyst deposition, the FTO–glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in an alkaline aqueous washing solution, DI water, ethanol, and then DI water again for 10 min per step. For FTO–glass electrodes, the metal precursor solution was directly cast on the substrate and exposed to the plasma jet to form a thin film of the mixed-metal oxide. For rotating disk electrode (RDE, Pine Instruments) measurements, 5 mm diameter GC disks were sonicated sequentially in pure DI water, acetone, 2-propanol, and then DI water again for 10 min per step. However, because glassy carbon substrates experienced significant degradation if exposed to the plasma jet, direct plasma oxidation of the catalysts on GC disks was not performed. Instead, an established drop-casting protocol for benchmarking nanoparticulate catalysts was used.41 Powder-based inks for each catalyst were made using 3.8 mL DI water, 1.0 mL 2-propanol, 40 μL of 5% Nafion 117 solution (Sigma Aldrich), and 80 mg of the mixed-metal oxide powder prepared by ball-milling. The catalyst powders contained only the ball-milled mixed-metal oxide material prepared via plasma oxidation without any supportive conductive media such as carbon black. The inks were sonicated for 10 min to ensure a uniform particle dispersion, and then 10 μL of the ink was pipetted onto a polished glassy carbon disk, followed by drying in an oven under air at 60 °C for 10 min.
Material characterization
Electron micrographs of the morphology and EDS measurements of the W1−xIrxO3−δ catalysts were performed with an FEI Nova 600 and a TESCAN VEGA3 SB-EasyProbe scanning electron microscopes (SEM) at accelerating voltages of ∼10–15 kV and 20 kV, respectively. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping measurements were conducted using either an FEI Tecnai F20 or JEOL 2010F microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
To quantify the surface area of the mixed-metal oxide catalysts, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis was performed with a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 porosimeter. Samples were carefully weighed and degassed before performing the measurements to remove any adsorbed contaminants from the surface and pores of the sample. Calculations for the BET surface area were done using the TriStar 3000 analysis program.
A Bruker D8 powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) system was used for crystal structure and phase analysis using non-monochromated Cu-Kα radiation produced by an X-ray tube operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The sample XRD patterns were scanned between 20–80° at a scan speed of 4 seconds per step with a step size of 0.02°. Bruker EVA software and powder diffraction file (PDF) were used for phase identification. Crystallographic data analysis software GSAS-EXPGUI42 was employed to analyze and/or quantify the phases of catalyst materials in the Rietveld method for structure refinement. Atomic positions, cell parameters, background, scale-factors, and profile parameters were all refined. Additionally, a March–Dollase algorithm was employed for the correction of preferential orientation. Surface elemental analysis was performed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a VG Scientific Multilab 3000 custom-built ultra-high vacuum system with Al-Kα radiation. XPSPEAK 4.1 software was used for peak deconvolution and the XPS data analysis. Room temperature Raman measurements were performed in a backscatter configuration using an inVia Renishaw micro-Raman spectrometer, equipped with a 50× objective lens, visible light optics, an 1800 mm−1 diffraction grating, and a HeNe laser producing 633 nm excitation wavelength. The silicon peak at 520 cm−1, measured from a standard silicon wafer, was used for the system calibration.
Electrochemical measurements
All measurements were performed in a three electrode setup using a Biologic SP-200 potentiostat. A Pt gauze counter electrode was separated from the main cell compartment with a glass frit and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) served as the reference electrode. All potentials were converted and referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Nernst equation:43 ERHE = ESCE + 0.241 + 0.059pH(1)
All electrochemical measurements were performed in aqueous 1 M H2SO4 at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 with continuous stirring of the electrolyte during cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry (CP) measurements. Catalyst current density vs. potential behavior was measured in each case for samples that were plasma oxidized directly on FTO substrates. The Ir-rich compositions on FTO/glass displayed highly stable behavior. However, plasma oxidation with the W precursor led to delamination issues under extended operation, so films were instead ball-milled to microparticles and bound to a GC disk for extended galvanostatic measurements.41 The ball-milled samples were electrochemically characterized for stability with a similar setup and experimental conditions using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) with the GC disk as the working electrode rotated at 1600 rpm and by monitoring the potential of the working electrode at a constant 10 mA cm−2. The particle binding method had limitations, however, and the Nafion binder film was observed to partially delaminate after extended testing. The unsteady performance of the WO3 (x = 0), which is known to be stable at pH 0 under anodic potentials,40,44 was attributed to this issue. Potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed before every experiment to determine the uncompensated solution resistance, Ru, and the potentiostat subsequently compensated for 85% of Ru during electrolysis. The typical electrochemical cell in these experiments had a resistance, Ru ∼ 10–20 Ω in 1 M H2SO4. The current densities were determined relative to the geometric projected electrode area throughout this study. The methodology for determining upper and lower bounds on the turnover frequency (TOF) are described in the ESI.†
Results and discussion
Morphology and phase homogeneity
Plasma synthesis can produce variations in structure due to the rapid crystallization and non-equilibrium mixed phase formation, which could have potential consequences for the electrocatalytic behavior of the materials. Electron microscopy showed that there was strong structural variation in the morphology with the W1−xIrxO3−δ stoichiometry, from a sponge-like microporous structure at x = 0.43 to a smoother layer at x = 0.01 (Fig. S2, ESI†). The BET-measured specific surface area per catalyst mass (Table S1, ESI†) consequently did not display a clear trend with Ir content either. EDS elemental mapping for mixed-metal oxide catalysts showed that W and Ir were uniformly distributed throughout the majority of the sample. Fig. 1 shows the EDS map for W0.99Ir0.01O3−δ, in which the Ir appears to be evenly distributed with no segregation into concentrated regions. Uniformity of the metal distribution was mostly maintained throughout the phase for compositions with higher percentages of Ir as well, though EDS maps for 8% and 43% Ir samples displayed isolated regions of concentrated W or Ir (Fig. S3, ESI†).

For the samples investigated, the phase homogeneity depended strongly on the fraction of Ir in the composition. The XRD data for the plasma-oxidized W1−xIrxO3−δ catalysts indicated that the mixed-metal oxides primarily maintained the triclinic structure of the WO3, with characteristic peaks for IrO2 observed at 28°, 35°, and 54° for the x = 0.43 material (Fig. 2). This finding was supported for x = 0.43 by Raman spectra showing a faint peak at ∼560 cm−1 attributed to IrO2 (Fig. S7, ESI†) as well as the O1s XPS spectra showing a shoulder with a binding energy at 532.8 eV corresponding to IrO2 (Fig. S10a, ESI†). Strong XRD peaks corresponding to metallic Ir were also present for x = 0.43 at 41°, 48°, and 69° (Fig. 2). However, in decreasing the Ir content to x = 0.08, there was no longer observable IrO2 in the XRD or O1s XPS spectra (Fig. S10d, ESI†), with only a smaller XRD peak for metallic Ir discernible at 41°. No diffraction peaks for IrO2 or metallic Ir were observed for x = 0.01, although such peaks may have been below the instrument detection limit. An XRD Rietveld analysis was employed for phase quantification to estimate the concentration of IrO2 and metallic Ir observed in nominal compositions with 8% Ir and above (Fig. S4 and Table S2, ESI†).

Fig. 3 shows HR-TEM images of the W1−xIrxO3−δ catalysts and is consistent with the XRD findings indicating some Ir metal phase segregation. The Ir-rich regions are observable as dark patches in the TEM, which generally correlated with areas of locally enhanced polycrystallinity. This effect was most clearly displayed for W0.57Ir0.43O3−δ, with multiple dark patches and misaligned lattice fringes, whereas the plasma-oxidized W0.99Ir0.01O3−δ particle was mostly uniform with highly parallel lattice fringes. As shown in Fig. 3 for each W1−xIrxO3−δ catalyst, the lattice spacing for most of the bulk phase corresponded to a d-spacing of ∼3.84 Å, consistent with the (002) planes for a WO3 crystal. The TEM for the x = 0.08 composition in Fig. 3b, however, shows a dark patch with a lattice d-spacing of 2.3 Å, which was indexed to Ir(111) and confirmed the presence of Ir metal inclusions. The plasma-oxidized W1−xIrxO3−δ structure thus generally consisted of evenly dispersed Ir throughout the WO3 phase interspersed with small pockets of Ir-rich metal, as seen further in Fig. S5 (ESI†) in which additional TEM and EDS mapping specifically targeted regions with Ir-rich clusters. In these maps, the regions with high counts for Ir corresponded to areas with low counts for O, consistent with the presence of metallic Ir inclusions. This data suggests the bulk of each mixed-metal precursor is a phase homogeneous solid solution of W1−xIrxO3−δ. However, there is a limit to how much Ir can be favorably incorporated into the WO3 lattice, and for increasing amounts of Ir beyond 1%, much of it is segregated to Ir and IrO2 nanoclusters.

Electrochemical performance of plasma-oxidized W1−xIrxO3−δ
The plasma-oxidized W1−xIrxO3−δ catalyst compositions were made into electrodes and measured as anodes for electrochemical water oxidation in pH 0 aqueous electrolyte (see Experimental). Fig. 4a shows the OER current density versus overpotential (J–η) behavior, with the catalyst activity parameters reported in Table 1. The overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 projected electrode area was reported in accordance with benchmarking protocol for electrocatalysts for a solar fuels application.7 The plasma-oxidized IrO2 (x = 1) had an overpotential of 0.28 V, which puts it on par with literature values for state-of-the-art thermally oxidized IrO2.7,35 On the other hand, WO3 (x = 0), devoid of active noble metals, had an overpotential of 1.58 V. Unsurprisingly therefore, higher Ir content mixed-metal catalyst compositions had better overall electrocatalytic performance (Fig. 4a) with lower overpotential (Table 1). Nevertheless, with only 1 at% of the W replaced with Ir atoms during plasma oxidation, the x = 0.01 composition decreased the overpotential of WO3 by more than 1 V to η = 0.5 V. In fact, if the current density of the pure IrO2 (x = 1) electrocatalyst is multiplied by the corresponding x value of the other compositions, the resulting J–η behavior outperformed the respective W1−xIrxO3−δ catalyst for x = 0.43 and 0.08 but underperformed for x = 0.01 (Fig. 4a), perhaps indicating greater activity per Ir content for x = 0.01.

Another relevant metric of catalyst activity is the turnover frequency (TOF, defined for OER as the molecules of O2 generated per metal atom per second), which is included in Table 1 for a characteristic overpotential of η = 0.3 V. The method used for calculating TOF is described in the ESI.† With the uncertainty in the number of metal sites contributing to the reaction, both a lower and an upper bound TOF were calculated. The lower bound turnover frequency (TOFLB) assumed all metal sites throughout the bulk contribute to the reaction.35 The upper bound turnover frequency (TOFUB), in contrast, was approximated assuming that only metal cations at the surface were active reaction sites. The resulting TOFLB for IrO2 of 0.010 s−1 matched well with a similarly calculated TOF for solution-cast thin films of IrOx,35 with the calculated TOFUB of IrO2 increasing to 0.47 s−1. As expected from Fig. 4a, the mixed-metal W1−xIrxO3−δ catalysts displayed lower TOF values on a per metal atom basis. However, if the activity is assumed to occur only at the Ir sites and the TOF values are corrected for the reduced Ir content in the mixed-metal oxides, the x = 0.01 composition actually displayed greater lower and upper TOF values than pure IrO2 (Table 1). Fig. 4b shows the Tafel slopes, with the slope for plasma-synthesized IrO2 (x = 1) of 85 mV dec−1 comparable but a bit higher than similar literature values. The plasma-synthesized W1−xIrxO3−δ compositions displayed a distinct increase in the Tafel slope from IrO2, with values comparable to the slope observed for WO3 (Table 1). This increased Tafel slope may indicate a shift in reaction mechanism as the lattice becomes dominated by the WO3 crystal structure and the minimized presence of IrO2.
The calculated TOF values based on Ir content indicated that only the x = 0.01 composition had higher activity per Ir site than the pure IrO2 (Table 1). From the materials characterization data discussed above, we thus speculate that the phase pure homogeneous W1−xIrxO3−δ solid solution surface had more active OER kinetics per Ir atom while segregation to Ir0 and IrO2 phases, particularly as clusters within the catalyst bulk where access to the electrolyte would be hindered, led to a reduced performance on an Ir atom basis. It is also possible that the oxygen deficiency created by balancing charge with Ir4+ in the W1−xIrxO3−δ phase leads to oxygen vacancies near the Ir site, with such vacancies reported to contribute to OER activity in metal oxides.45 Future density functional theory (DFT) modeling of the W1−xIrxO3−δ crystal structure as a function of Ir content and oxygen vacancies on the binding energy with OER intermediates could provide additional insight for designing higher TOF catalysts.
Furthermore, the promising activity with only 1% of the metal sites consisting of Ir was achieved without significant corrosion of the material under acidic oxidizing conditions, due to the use of W with its corrosion resistant oxide as the structural support material. The W1−xIrxO3−δ catalyst compositions were evaluated for durability by monitoring the potential during a galvanostatic measurement at 10 mA cm−2, ensuring an equal charge passed per time for each material (Fig. 4c).7 Using this method, all W1−xIrxO3−δ compositions displayed steady catalytic performance over the time period, in contrast to established earth-abundant OER catalysts under acidic conditions.6,7
Plasma vs. thermally oxidized W0.99Ir0.01O3−δ
To test if the preparation of the W1−xIrxO3−δvia plasma oxidation (P) had a significant effect on the catalyst behavior, the x = 0.01 composition was compared to a material of equivalent stoichiometry prepared with the same precursors via thermal oxidation (T). Compared to plasma-oxidized material, the thermally oxidized 1% Ir catalyst showed a rougher microparticulate structure (Fig. S2, ESI†). HR-TEM analysis showed larger grain size and higher crystallinity for the plasma-oxidized material (Fig. 3c) compared to the thermally oxidized sample, which exhibited strong contrast variations due to nanoscale polycrystallinity and voids (Fig. 3d). This structural difference is most clearly displayed in the STEM images, in which x = 0.01 (P) particulates showed crystal grains of >150 nm while x = 0.01 (T) particulates had grains <50 nm and displayed nanoscopic roughness and porosity (Fig. 3e and f).

Fig. 5 shows the electrochemical and materials characterization comparison between W0.99Ir0.01O3−δ fabricated by plasma vs. thermal oxidation. Most notably, the same nominal W0.99Ir0.01O3−δ composition displayed strikingly different electrocatalytic behavior depending on the oxidation method. Thermally oxidized material led to an overpotential of 1.07 V with a high Tafel slope of 301 mV dec−1, compared to 0.50 V and a Tafel slope of 136 mV dec−1 when plasma oxidized. The exact structural and chemical differences which lead to strongly enhanced OER activity in plasma relative to thermally oxidized material is somewhat unclear. XRD characterization of the x = 0.01 (T) composition was comparable to the x = 0.01 (P), with all the peaks indexed to the WO3 phase without any resolvable IrO2 or Ir peaks within the detection limit (Fig. 5c). Similarly, Raman spectra for both materials displayed the characteristic WO3 peaks without the corresponding IrO2 peaks (Fig. 5d). However, for both x = 0.01 samples there was an additional Raman band peaking at ∼960 cm−1 not present in either WO3 or IrO2, which the literature generally attributes to the νs (WO terminal) symmetric stretching mode.46,47 This band was present for all the mixed-metal W1−xIrxO3−δ materials (Fig. S7, ESI†), and similar Raman features have been reported for numerous metal heteropolyoxo tungstate species.47 This Raman band at ∼960 cm−1 thus reflects distortion among the tungsten oxide framework and further supports the presence of an iridium polytungstate phase. Also, the noticeable broadening of the Raman bands of the thermal sample relative to the plasma sample has been correlated to greater nanocrystallinity,48 consistent with the observable nanocrystal domains in the HR-TEM for the x = 0.01 (T) (Fig. 3).

XPS was used to probe the catalyst surface chemical bonding environment, and Fig. 6 shows the key data with normalized intensity for the ease of peak position comparison. Detailed XPS fitting for the various catalyst types are presented in Fig. S8–S10 (ESI†). For the O1s orbital, the main peaks at 530 eV and 532.8 eV were attributed to O2− in the WO3 lattice and IrO2 lattice, respectively. At a high concentration of Ir (x = 0.43), a distinct shoulder was present at ∼533 eV, consistent with the presence of IrO2 as confirmed by XRD. Although this shoulder was absent for plasma-oxidized compositions of x = 0.08 and 0.01, it was clearly present for the thermally oxidized x = 0.01 sample. Because no IrO2 peaks were discernible in the XRD for the x = 0.01 (T) catalyst (Fig. 5c), this phase was either below the XRD detectable limit or restricted to the surface region probed by the XPS. However, no equivalent IrO2 O1s peak was present for the x = 0.01 (P), indicating that surface primarily maintained the metastable W1−xIrxO3−δ phase. Spectra for the W4f doublet peaks were comparable for all the catalysts with the W4f7/2 peak at ∼35.3 eV, close to literature values for W6+ in WO3 (Fig. S8, ESI†).49,50 The Ir4f peaks, in contrast, displayed noticeably different XPS spectra between plasma and thermally oxidized W0.99Ir0.01O3−δ (Fig. 6b). The Ir4f doublet peak for the x = 0.01 (T) material was well-fit primarily by a single Ir4+ peak, while the x = 0.01 (P) Ir4f signal required both Ir4+ and a lower binding energy peak to properly fit. The identity of this additional peak could possibly be attributed to either Ir in the mixed-metal polytungstate phase or to trace metallic Ir segregated to the particle surface.

Although it remains uncertain how the exact nature of the structure–function relationship permits dramatic enhancement in the OER catalysis of the plasma-synthesized compound relative to the thermally synthesized compound, the materials characterization data highlights the physical differences between these forms of W0.99Ir0.01O3−δ which are likely responsible. Morphologically, the Raman and electron microscopy data indicated that the thermal material consisted of rougher particles with nanocrystalline grains and porosity, in comparison to the smoother plasma material with larger crystal grains. Chemically, although both materials displayed a mixed iridium polytungstate phase of similar crystal structure to WO3, XPS data indicated that the thermally oxidized catalyst had more segregated IrO2 domains. Taken together, these observations suggest that the smooth crystalline faces of the metastable W0.99Ir0.01O3−δ had greater kinetic activity for water oxidation in acid. A more well-developed study focused on theoretically modeling OER at the W1−xIrxO3−δ surface, with crystal models informed by the data reported here, would provide greater insight into how the plasma-synthesized material alters the water oxidation mechanism.
The observed 570 mV difference in the benchmarked overpotential between a plasma vs. thermally oxidized catalyst of the same composition clearly displays the effect that the non-equilibrium reaction and crystallization process can have on a mixed-metal oxide material. Several ambitious research efforts have used combinatorial synthesis and characterization methods to explore the elemental parameter space in search of novel active materials for OER catalysis, with most relying on thermal oxidation to convert the precursors to mixed-metal oxides.15,51,52 The plasma vs. thermal oxidation catalyst results herein indicate that such combinatorial efforts could be in danger of bypassing promising materials which may require a metastable phase for high activity.
Conclusions
By synergistically combining Ir with W, a mixed-metal oxide phase with noble metal content as low as 1% had durable anodic performance in acid with promising OER catalysis. The critical electrocatalytic properties were enabled by oxidation in a non-equilibrium plasma environment, with traditional thermal oxidation instead resulting in significantly inferior OER activity. Although much work remains to be done to fundamentally explain the shift in catalysis, the materials characterization indicated the plasma method led to better catalysis by promoting larger crystals of the homogenous iridium polytungstate phase. The new material has promise for advancing the scalability of acidic water electrolysis. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the wide composition space of thermally processed oxides which have failed to show noteworthy catalysis may yield different outcomes and new active compositions of metastable phases when processed instead via non-equilibrium plasma oxidation.

Broader context
Electrochemical fuel production offers a clean route for the energy-dense storage of intermittent renewable electricity and excess electricity that would otherwise be curtailed. Possible fuels include hydrogen from electrolysis, hydrocarbons from carbon dioxide reduction, and even ammonia from nitrogen reduction. For a large-scale and sustainable fuel synthesis technology, water serves as the hydrogen source and must be oxidized at the anode via the oxygen evolution reaction. Water oxidation is a kinetically difficult half-reaction, and thus a highly active catalyst is important to minimize the overpotential and maximize the energy-conversion efficiency. Numerous studies and combinatorial synthesis efforts have pursued improved water oxidation catalysis by testing novel mixed metal oxide compositions. These materials have generally been synthesized by a thermal oxidation route, in which the extended high temperature step often leads to phase segregation into different stable equilibrium compositions. Therefore, most of the alloy composition space is not actually fabricated, possibly bypassing promising catalyst materials. Furthermore, there are many advantages to operating in strongly acidic electrolyte, but the resulting harsh environment severely limits what materials can act as active water oxidation catalysts without prohibitive corrosion. Only rare noble metal oxides like iridium oxide have been simultaneously active and stable in acid.
