    , Accepted 19th June 2019First published on 19th June 2019AbstractCarbon is an essential element of life on earth. Since the evolution of mankind, human beings have exerted a substantial impact on carbon distribution in the various geo-habitats. By doing so, they have influenced climate on a local, regional and global scale. Climate, however, is not a constant property; due to intricate feedback loops it is always in flux. Depending on the atmospheric composition, the climate has changed globally many times over geological history, and it will continue to do so. Consequently, the key question is not if humans affect the climate, but in which direction and how quickly. Recent changes in the earth's average temperature have been linked to the increased concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere caused by the burning of fossil carbon fuels. Nevertheless, some critics continue to dismiss the real connection between CO2 emissions and the impact of CO2 on climate. Focussing on carbon as an essential element of life, this review provides an overview of the carbon inventory on earth, analyses the fluxes of carbon among the different geo-habitats and considers pathways towards establishing anthropogenic carbon cycles.P.

Introduction
Our current economy is driven largely by value chains based on the use of fossil carbon resources. The progressive depletion of these resources together with the increasing impact of human activity on entire segments of our environment calls for a fundamental reassessment of how the goods of our daily life are made. How can the conventional economy, powered by fossil carbon resources, be transformed to an environmentally sustainable, closed-loop economy? At the heart of this transformation is a switch from economic value chains based on the intensive use of fossil fuels – oil, natural gas, and coal – to value chains based on renewable energy resources – wind, solar, geothermal, tidal and wave energy. Although this implies that less fossil raw materials may be extracted in the future, carbon-based materials, goods, and fuels will still continue to be indispensable. As part of ubiquitous chemical compounds, the element carbon (symbol C) is a key component of life as we know it today. All organisms, from the mighty elephant to the smallest microorganism, are essentially created from carbon. The mass fraction of carbon (wC) is typically in the range 0.45–0.50, based on dry biomass (Fig. 1). Plants, likewise, primarily consist of carbon, wC 0.40–0.50.1,2

The bars represent the values for the lower range (min), mean range und upper range (max) of the carbon mass fraction wC; references are given in the main text; organisms refers to live animals, wood to live stems, fuel to gasoline and diesel. 
Meanwhile our daily lives are irrevocably linked to the manifold uses of carbonaceous materials, goods, and fuels. We dress in carbon-based materials, such as cotton, wC 0.42–0.46,3,4 write on paper, a carbon-based material, wC 0.39–0.45,5–8 and construct our houses with carbon-based materials. Though the carbon content is apparent for wood, wC 0.45–0.54,9–14 it is not as obvious in concrete, wC 0.01–0.04,15 and steel, wC 0.01–0.02.16,17 While the carbon contents may appear low for the latter materials, their key properties are affected by the carbon they contain. The large quantities of these materials used for construction and other applications means that large quantities of carbon are involved. Analogously, we use carbon-based fuels, as natural gas, wC 0.72–0.79, to heat our houses,11,12 and operate our cars with liquid carbon-based gasoline or diesel fuels, wC 0.86–0.87.12,18–20
Due to the specific properties of carbon-based chemical entities (vide infra), industrial society will continue to depend on the intensive use of carbon-based materials and energy resources in the future. Accordingly, a long-term secure, and climate-neutral supply of raw materials and energy needs to be structured on regenerative carbon resources and closing anthropogenic carbon cycles.
The intensive use of fossil raw materials and fuels is accompanied by enormous anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.21–24 Many of the associated problems may be solved, if we succeed in closing anthropogenic carbon cycles and modifying the economic systems accordingly. Above all, the atmosphere must no longer be subjected to a large net input of carbon dioxide (CO2)25,26 and other greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4)27–29 and nitrous oxide (N2O).30–32 Strict legislation has triggered a decrease in the anthropogenic use of greenhouse gases such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC)24,33,34 and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)35 over recent years. The EU has committed itself under international law to also reduce emissions of the major greenhouse gases, in particular, of carbon dioxide, by 40% in 2030 relative to emissions of 1990.36 By 2050, the EU aims to cut emissions by 80–95% compared to 1990.36 However, the associated transition in energy policy from fossil fuels to the increased use of sustainable renewable energy resources is not yet self-sustaining per se. At present, the global restructuring of energy systems appears to be stalling. According to the last figures of the BP Statistical Review of World Energy,37 global energy consumption increased by 2.2% in 2017, with the consumption of coal, oil (1.8%) and gas (3.0%) rising again significantly for the first time in three years. Contrary to the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, CO2 emissions have consequently risen sharply. Only small achievements occurred in increasing the energy intensity. Nevertheless, an increase in the share of renewable energy sources gives hope that the energy transition will continue.
Consequently, new carbon sources as well as new conversion technologies will have to be made available. Based on comprehensive analysis of the available carbon sources, routes will have to be shown, how large-volume raw materials, the so-called base or platform chemicals, are efficiently accessible as a foundation for sustainable value-added chains of the processing industry, the chemical industry, and the energy sector. From a technical as well as an ecological and economic point of view, an economy with closed carbon cycles needs to be established. Structures and practicable transition paths towards a carbon-centred economy need to be developed, thereby making a systemic contribution towards shaping future circular economic structures and completing the energy transition.
This review provides an overview of the carbon inventory on earth, and analyses carbon fluxes throughout the different geo-habitats. It also considers pathways to establish anthropogenic carbon cycles. Ultimately, the authors aim to prompt readers in engaging further in discussions about how this goal may be achieved.
Results and discussion
Historic view
Since the beginning of industrialization the average air temperature close to the surface of earth has increased by roughly +0.85 °C.38 While the direct effects of such an apparently small temperature change are hardly perceptible, indirect effects are linked to the melting of continental glaciers,39,40 shrinkage of the arctic and antarctic polar ice41–44 and changes in the intensity and distribution of rainfall.45,46 Especially the recent years since 1990 are characterized by year-averaged temperatures above the long-term mean.38,47 The increase in the average air temperature also has been linked to the increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere caused by the burning of fossil carbonaceous materials.48,49 Some critics have dismissed this anthropogenic connection by arguing that natural effects, such as fluctuations in the radiance of sun50–53 and volcanic activity54–56 also affect the average air temperature on earth. The heat capacity of expansive water bodies, the sea and larger lakes, has a pronounced dampening effect57 as experienced by humans living close to the shore.58,59 Consequently, the air temperature lags several decades behind any global changes in the energy balance of earth.60–62 Even so, international climate researchers with activities bundled in the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)63 have interpreted recent climate changes as anthropogenic.64,65 Upon continued use of fossil energy sources, a further rise in the average temperature on earth by several degrees is predicted.38 Even if the global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions were halved by the middle of the 21st century, current models still forecast a further increase in the global average air temperature by at least +2 °C.38
The element carbon
Due to its particular properties, carbon plays a pivotal role for life on earth.66 The chemical versatility of carbon is reflected in the number of its allotropic forms (Fig. 2). Diamond,67–69 the sp3-hybridised, under ambient conditions, metastable form of carbon, and graphite70,71 the corresponding thermodynamically stable sp2-hybridised form of carbon, exhibit very different properties.72 Further carbon allotropes comprise discrete nanostructures, such as fullerenes,73–76 spherical assemblies of five- and six-membered carbon rings, rod-like carbon nanotubes77–79 and carbyne,80,81 a linear chain of sp-hybridised carbon atoms (C–CC–C). Although some of these allotropic forms of carbon play a substantial role in the socioeconomic domain, most carbon on earth is part of molecular assemblies, rocks, salts and intermetallic entities. Molecular assemblies of the biosphere comprise carbon that is bound mostly to hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur. In contrast to the heavier elements from the third period onwards, carbon is capable of forming double bonds, which allows for the diversity of molecules formed. Beyond the biosphere and organic molecules, with their high structural complexity, carbon-based salts, most prominently carbonates, are essential components of rock.

In chemical entities, the formal oxidation state of carbon varies. Carbon forms bonds with metals, creating more or less ionic metal carbides in which carbon can be described formally as C4− ion.82 Within the group of hydrocarbons, the formal oxidation states range from −IV (CH4), over −III (H3C–CH3), −II (H2CCH2), and −I (HCCH), to 0 as the central carbon of tert-butyl units. Bound to more electronegative elements, carbon acquires oxidation states up to +IV. Starting from methane as prominent representative of hydrocarbons, oxidation leads to compounds such as H3COH, H2CO, CO and CO2. Oxidized C1 molecules are characterized by decreasing energy content with increasing oxidation state (Fig. 3). This trend is quite general within series of molecules and exemplifies, why hydrocarbons and not highly functionalized molecules, as they are found in biomass, serve as an energy carrier in technical applications. Especially the gravimetric energy density of hydrocarbons (vide infra), such as gasoline 47.3 MJ kg−1,12 and methane 55.4 MJ kg−1,12 is far higher than that of other energy carriers. For comparison, the gravimetric energy density of lithium batteries is about 100 times lower, 0.54–0.90 MJ kg−1.85 For experimental devices demonstrating the current limit for lithium–sulphur batteries, gravimetric energy densities of up to 4.69 MJ kg−1 have been reported.86 The actual theoretical limit has been predicted to be at 9.36 MJ kg−1.87 Due to physical constraints, long-distance transport via road vehicles and airplanes will continue to depend on carbon-based fuels.

Carbon inventory
A large fraction of the carbon we deal with on a daily basis is part of the biosphere (Fig. 4, Table 1). Living organisms, parts of living organisms, as well as waste products and incompletely decomposed remains of living organisms make up the biomass. The term ‘biomass’ encompasses plants (so-called “phytomass”), animals and microorganisms (so-called “zoomass”). Terrestrial biomass with 600–650 Gt C (ref. 88 and 89) comprises the largest fraction of carbon, while marine biota are estimated at 389–690 Gt C. Thus, the biomass is distributed very differently over the two major biospheres. Sun and rainfall are major drivers of terrestrial plant growth and result in biological activity. The phytomass (450 Gt C (ref. 90)) also makes up the largest part of the terrestrial carbon reservoir. Animal life plays a central role by mediating carbon exchange between the different ecosystems and the atmosphere.91 The largest fraction of animals (2 Gt C) are, nevertheless, marine.90 In the terrestrial biosphere, some of the organic carbon (3 Gt C a−1§) enters the soil through soil biota and living microorganisms as well as through root exudates, and by the decomposition of plant, animal, microorganism residues.92 Bacteria (70 Gt C (ref. 90)) and archaea (7 Gt C (ref. 90)) are part of these subsurface environments. In total, 1.5–3.0 × 103 Gt carbon are stored globally as organic carbon in soil.88,93 In addition, soil comprises inorganic carbon such as carbonate minerals.

In the atmosphere, the preindustrial concentration of CO2 was roughly 280 ppm.57 This corresponds to a historic carbon stock of 597 (ref. 89)–750 (ref. 57) Gt C in the atmosphere and about 1 ppm of global carbon resources. In comparison, the world's oceans, making up 38000 Gt C,88 hold significantly higher amounts of carbon mostly in form of HCO3−, CO32− and CO2. Sediments comprising organic matter and carbonate sediments that sank to the ocean floor are by far the largest carbon reservoir on the earth's surface. A large fraction of this carbon has been part of a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere some 3.5 bio. years ago.94–99 The transition to the present day oxygen-rich atmosphere entails that, on a geologically long time scale, the primary production of biomass by photosynthesis has been greater than respiration.88,100–102 This imbalance between photosynthesis and respiration has led to storage of carbon in sediments and accumulation of O2 in the atmosphere. Accumulation of carbon materials has resulted in the net storage of 1.25 × 107 Gt C (ref. 88) in sediments leading to the atmospheric oxygen being left over. A tiny fraction of less than 0.5% of the sedimentary carbon now constitutes the 3.5 × 103 Gt C (ref. 99) in known fossil fuel reserves (coal, oil, natural gas).
In comparison, the upper mantle of the earth down to a depth of 700 km, corresponding to 18.5% of earth's mass, is a far larger reservoir of carbon. Its carbon content exceeds that of all exogenic reservoirs. In total, the earth's crust (comprising the lithosphere, the biosphere, the atmosphere, and the hydrosphere) contains 6–8 × 107 Gt of carbon, making carbon the tenth most abundant element on earth.103
Carbon fluxes in the undisturbed natural carbon cycle
The global carbon cycle involves the circulation of carbon among the different reservoirs of the biosphere, soil, atmosphere, hydrosphere and the lithosphere. This exchange occurs on different time scales.
In the undisturbed natural carbon cycle, the terrestrial biosphere takes up annually 120 (ref. 57)–123§ Gt C a−1 from the atmosphere. The oceanic biosphere has similar productivity and takes up 92§–108 (ref. 89) Gt C a−1 from the surrounding water body. By photosynthesis CO2 is reduced by plants, plankton and algae using water as primary hydrogen source. An enzyme cascade largely based on chlorophyll as the main chromophore captures the energy from sun and functions as catalyst.104,105 Chlorophyll can also be exchanged by other chromophores.106 Moreover, sugars, initially produced by photosynthesis, serve as an energy source and are converted in biologic cascades to essential molecules sustaining life, such as cell scaffolds and lipids.107 Photosynthesis, however, is relatively inefficient in converting sunlight into chemical compounds.108 Terrestrial plants typically utilize 0.5–2% of the energy received through solar irradiance to construct biomass. Certain plants, such as sugar cane, have higher energy efficiencies of up to 8%.109–113
The organic matter produced by photosynthesis stores about 470–490 kJ mol−1 C (ref. 88) in chemically bound energy. About half of the energy is used for intracellular activities. As the result of cellular respiration and maintenance of cell structures, about half of the bound carbon is, thus, released again as CO2. The other half is available to build the complex structures of phytomass. The amounts are comparable in the terrestrial and oceanic biospheres.89 Decomposition of terrestrial biomass releases 60 Gt C as CO2 back into the atmosphere. In the oceans, about 78 Gt C a−1 are metabolized in the light-flooded upper layer of the oceans. The remaining 11 Gt C a−1 are transported mostly as sinking particles (detritus) to the deeper parts of the oceans. This carbon export is the foundation of the food chain in the deeper oceans. The carbon sequestration in the oceans has been estimated to 2 Gt C a−1.114 Additionally, 1 Gt C a−1 is bound by carbonate-producing phytoplankton and zooplankton as calcium carbonate polymorphs (calcite, aragonite, vaterite) and Ca/Mg carbonate. About 10% of the carbonate transported into the ocean depths exit the water body as sediment (<0.1 Gt a−1 C). The remainder re-dissolves due to the retrograde solubility of carbonates with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure.115 The associated calcite saturation horizon (CSH) lies at a depth of 4500–4200 m in the Atlantic Ocean and is considerably higher, at a depth of 2800–3100 m, in the Pacific Ocean.116
Between the atmosphere and oceans, 90 Gt C a−1 are exchanged annually in both directions. Additionally, about 2 Gt C a−1 of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide is absorbed by the oceans. However, in biological terms, the exchange of carbon is characterized by a long 500–1000 years period of deep-water formation and global thermohaline circulation. Thus, the rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 by anthropogenic activities has resulted in a deviation from the long-term equilibrium situation. Due the magnitude of the oceanic carbon reservoir, however, it is the oceans that regulate the steady state of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.
The global carbon cycle is part of the much larger sedimentary cycle that involves cycling of large masses of carbon between the inner and outer spheres of the earth. The chemical weathering of rocks, in particular, is a major geological process that not only shapes the earth, but likewise reduces atmospheric CO2 concentrations. On geological time scales, the weathering of silicate minerals (eqn (1) and (2)), such as olivine ((Mg,Fe)2SiO4) and calcium silicate (CaSiO3), has a significant long-term effect on the global carbon budget.117 The annual global CO2 consumption by chemical weathering is estimated at 0.233–0.288 Gt C a−1.118 A large fraction of the material is transported to the oceans and sediment. Present-day accumulation rates of CaCO3 on the sea floor amount to 0.38 Gt C a−1. The long term burial of organic carbon is equivalent to 0.144 Gt C a−1. Removal of the 461 ± 19 Gt C (ref. 88) released cumulatively by mankind as CO2 into the atmosphere since pre-industrial times (1800–2000) would take only about 3200§–4200 (ref. 88) years, if the flux were sustained and there were no feedback processes restoring atmospheric CO2. Mg2SiO4 + 2CO2 → 2MgCO3 + SiO2(1) CaSiO3 + CO2 → CaCO3 + SiO2(2)
The sedimentary cycle, in turn, is part of the much bigger rock cycle that transfers materials among young unconsolidated sediments, sedimentary rocks, crystalline crust and the earth's mantle. Much of this cycle occurs in subduction zones, where 0.040–0.115 Gt C a−1 are subducted annually.119 Here carbonates react with silicate minerals such as olivine ((Mg,Fe)2SiO4) and serpentinite (Mg3Si2O5(OH)4) to ophicarbonates.120 Subduction of dolomite contained in a 1–3 km-thick layer of serpentinized forearc mantle thus leads to sequestration of 0.002 to 0.005 Gt C a−1.119 Processes like devolatilization, partial melting and dissolution of carbonate minerals lead to the return of 0.018–0.043 Gt C a−1 as CO2 to the atmosphere via volcanic activity.119 The comparably low fluxes exemplifies the long time-scales in the order of 108 to 109 years of geochemical cycles involving the interior of earth.88
Changes brought about by anthropogenic activities
Since the mid-18th century, anthropogenic activities have led to a constantly accelerating release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In 2006, the annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions into the atmosphere have for the first time exceeded 8 Gt C a−1.57 On average, this corresponds to an annual per capita emission of 4.6 t a−1.89 In the USA, a citizen emits an average of 19.0 t CO2 a−1, while in Germany this value is 9.8 t CO2 a−1.89 These annual emissions correspond to about 1% of the CO2 present in the atmosphere and 0.4% of the annual natural exchange of CO2 between biomass and oceans.
Since the 1960s, the atmospheric CO2 concentration has been recorded systematically at different places on earth. Particularly prominent are the measurements of Charles Keeling on Mauna Loa volcano on Hawaii (Fig. 5).121 Undisturbed by nearby larger land masses, the recorded series show the increasing concentration of CO2 from 313 ppm in March 1958 to the current 410 ppm. In parallel, the atmospheric oxygen has decreased to the same extent.57 Because of the seasonal offset of photosynthesis (spring, summer) and respiration of biomass (autumn, winter) the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere fluctuates (Fig. 5, insert). These fluctuations are particularly pronounced in northern regions. In the southern hemisphere, the periodicity is offset by half a year and is less pronounced due to the smaller expanse of biomass.
 Fig. 5  Global variation in the atmospheric CO2 concentration derived for 12.10.2014 based on satellite recordings (top left, high CO2 concentrations marked in red, low concentrations in green) and rising CO2 concentration measured in ice cores since AD 0 (bottom right) and at selected stations in the northern and southern hemisphere marked on the globe with circles, Point barrow, Alaska; Mauna Loa, Hawaii; Baring Head, New Zealand; latitude 90°S, South Pole since 1960 (centre). References are given in the text. 
Interestingly, only about half of the anthropogenic CO2 (9 Gt C a−1) emitted annually through combustion of fossil resources and changes in land use remains in the atmosphere (4 Gt C a−1). Roughly a quarter each is taken up by the terrestrial biosphere (2.6 Gt C a−1) and the oceans (2.2 Gt C a−1).57 At present, the global thermohaline circulation in the oceans is marked by an inequilibrium state, whereby the downward circulation is loaded with additional anthropogenic CO2 and the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration in the return flow is still on the pre-industrial level (Fig. 6). This difference currently drives the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 into the deeper oceans: thus, the Atlantic Ocean takes up 41%, the Pacific Ocean 32%, the Indian Ocean 23% and the Southern Ocean 4% of the annual global flux into the oceans of 1.42 Gt C a−1.122 In total, about 44% of the CO2 cumulatively emitted (461 ± 19 Gt C) since preindustrial times (1800–2000) has been taken up by the oceans (205 ± 2 Gt C).88

Threats caused by unbalanced carbon flow
The uptake of CO2 into the oceans has caused the pH-value to be gradually shifted to lower values. When CO2 dissolves in water, it reacts to carbonic acid (H2CO3) which later dissociates in two steps to HCO3− and CO32− (eqn (3)). At the pH of seawater of 7.8–8.4, the largest fraction of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is present as HCO3− (90%), followed by CO32− (10%) and physically dissolved CO2. With typical DIC concentrations of 2000–2100 μmol kg−1, the yearly increase of atmospheric CO2 by ∼1.9 ppm results in an increase of DIC in surface seawater by ∼1 μmol kg−1.89 Until the year 2100, this will lead to a decrease in the pH-value by 0.3–0.4 units. This corresponds to doubling of the proton concentration, a phenomenon called “ocean acidification”. Due to physical equilibria, the ability of the oceans to take up further carbon will be reduced. An increase in the average seawater temperature has the same effect, as the Henry constant for the uptake of CO2 into surface water has a negative correlation with temperature. CO2 + H2O ⇌ H2CO3 ⇌ HCO3− + H+ ⇌ CO32− + 2H+(3)
Soil organic carbon has bulk residence times on the order of 1000 years.93 As a result of warming, CO2 production from soil increases by increasing microbial decomposition of soil organic carbon. Subsoils (>30 cm depth) contribute 20 to 25% of whole-profile respiration and 10% of the warming response. Thus, warming by 4 °C leads to additional respiration of 2.8 g C per kg of whole-profile soil C. By extrapolation, subsoils could lose 3.1 × 103 Gt C a−1 resulting from a 4 °C-warming.93 The response would correspond to roughly 30% of current anthropogenic CO2 emissions.
Long-term sustainability by anthropogenic carbon cycles
As many materials and compounds of our daily life will continue to be carbon-based, any society that wants to be sustainable will have to create anthropogenic carbon cycles on the long run. A general outline of such carbon cycles is given in Fig. 7. The required large amounts of carbon are accessible from a variety of industrial, biological, volcanic or fossil sources. Carbon from these sources will be fed into the forthcoming anthropogenic carbon cycles. In the first step, carbon-containing raw materials are converted through present or novel industrial value chains to materials, chemical intermediates and fuels. These will be used in the various application fields as materials for making chemical products or as a transport vector in the energy sector. At the end of life, the incorporated carbon will have to be considered as a valuable resource. Driven by energy from renewable resources, the carbon in these materials is to be fed back into the industrial value chains to make new materials, chemical compounds and fuels.

One can consider two basic options for closing the cycle. The cycle can be closed after combustion of carbon-containing materials, via atmospheric carbon dioxide, or, exergetically better, by direct or indirect recycling of the carbon contained in the corresponding substance. Balancing the net fluxes through such anthropogenic carbon cycles requires that any excess quantity of carbon that is fed freshly into the carbon cycles is then deposited in long-term sinks. Only to a certain degree can carbon be taken up by natural sinks, such as the natural carbon fixation process of the oceans.123–126 The present CO2 emissions exceed the rate of this uptake by far. Noteworthy is that, especially for the atmosphere, the influx of carbon dioxide and the net removal of carbon dioxide have to be balanced, if the CO2 level is to be levelled. Some of the carbon dioxide may be used to grow extra biomass that can be used to drive the next carbon cycles.127 Sinks may include anthropogenic applications with sufficient scale and extended binding time for the contained carbon, such as construction. In the long term, however, excess carbon will have to be placed back into geologic formations and rock formations.
Sources for carbon
The carbon fed freshly into the anthropogenic carbon cycles can originate from various industrial, biological, volcanic and fossil sources. In the production industry of today, large amounts of carbon dioxide are removed from gas streams. Examples include the sweetening of natural gas,128–130 conventional syngas and hydrogen production,131,132 ammonia production,133 and many processes in chemical production.134,135 In addition, combustion of carbon materials in stationary sources releases large quantities of carbon dioxide that can be separated for industrial use.136–144 Likewise during fermentation, large amounts of carbon dioxide are produced in quite high purity.145 In biomass, 120 (ref. 57)–123§ Gt C a−1 are bound annually. Clearly, priority needs to be given to biomass that is grown for food purposes. Other biomass, in particular residues originating from biomass production such as straw and waste oils and fats, are excellent feedstock for forthcoming anthropogenic carbon cycles. Biomass can also be grown specifically for energy applications. Moreover, CO2 of volcanic origin can be harvested for industrial use. In this context, one example is the George Olah plant in Iceland that produces methanol from volcanic CO2 and hydrogen produced with geothermal electricity.146,147 For a certain period of time, fossil carbon resources – oil, natural gas, hard coal and lignite – also will continue to be important. New technologies will make additional resources accessible. For instance, the current fracking boom has led to a large supply of natural gas.148,149 Gas hydrates formed in the oceans in a so-called gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) at depths of roughly 600–1000 meters may become accessible in the near future.150–152 At present, the use of renewable feedstock compared to fossil feedstock,153 with a ratio of 8:92 in the chemical industry, remains small. Yet the increasing share of renewables37 is setting a promising trend.
Make and use phase
Present industrial value chains will have to be adjusted to establish anthropogenic carbon cycles.154 In this context, the most relevant application fields of carbon-based compounds are materials, chemical compounds and fuels in the energy sector. Fig. 8 illustrates the enormous scale of current use of carbon-based materials.
 Fig. 8  Selected examples of large anthropogenic application fields of carbon-based compounds. For references, please refer to the text. 
One of the largest application fields of carbon-based materials is the polymer sector with 335 Mt a−1.155 Conventional fossil-based polymers, such as polyethylene, 116 Mt a−1,156,157 and polypropylene, 68 Mt a−1,156,157 continue to grow in importance from an already large base. By contrast, only a fraction of the polymers are bio-based, 2.05 Mt a−1 in 2017.158 Polyolefins, among the lightest synthetic materials produced on a large scale, are readily shaped into products, show good material properties and resist degradation by air, water, and many chemicals. Consequently, polyolefins have been used widely. The duration of the use phase varies considerably with the application field (Fig. 9). At the end of life, about 31% of the polymeric materials are transformed back into products.155 Due to their beneficial properties, polymers comprising heteroatoms,159 such as polyurethanes, have a high growth rate. Noteworthy here is that also the natural product wood essentially consists of polymeric carbohydrate sugar building blocks, and it, likewise, can be considered as a polymer containing heteroatoms. When used in construction and other long-term applications, wood can reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions compared to using concrete as building material.160
 Fig. 9  Primary production of plastics in 2015 according to polymer type (insert, in Mio. t a−1) and duration of use in different applications fields indicating the average use time (dark blue) and the standard deviation (white bar for −σ and light blue for +σ). 
Inorganic materials, such as concrete produced worldwide on a 5 103 Mt a−1 (ref. 161) scale, also contain a certain fraction of carbon. The key component of concrete is the cement binder which is produced at present on a scale of 5 × 102 (ref. 162)–2.2 × 103 (ref. 163) Mt a−1 by calcination of limestone and calcium silicate. During the calcination, large amounts of CO2 are released into the atmosphere. However, during the hardening stage, cement converts back to carbonate, absorbing carbon dioxide from air.164 Using a larger fraction of silicates for cement production will lessen the CO2 burden on the atmosphere. In concrete, another fraction of carbon is contained not only as carbonate gravel but also in the various additives used to tailor the properties of the cement.
Moreover, steel and cast iron, currently produced on a scale of 1240 Mt a−1,165 contain a certain fraction of carbon. In interstitial positions of the metal lattice, the less than 1–4% fraction of carbon significantly changes the properties of iron. Adjusting the carbon content is an important tool to tailor the hardness of the material. Considering the large scale of iron use, significant amounts of carbon are involved.
In comparison, carbon utilization in the chemical sector is distributed over a variety of smaller products. Examples for large-volume chemicals are methanol, syngas, a mixture of carbon oxides and hydrogen, and formaldehyde (Fig. 8). However, it needs to be pointed out here that, with current industrial technologies, more carbon is released during generating the quantities of energy required for processing and separation than is actually used as carbon-based raw materials for chemical production.166 Industrial carbon fluxes were recently analysed for Japan for the reference year 2011.167
The energy sector is the largest utilization field of carbon-based compounds. At present, natural gas consisting mostly of methane is extracted on a scale of 2706 Mt a−1.37 Liquid fuels are produced on a scale of 900 Mt a−1. Even if the energy needed for stationary applications is supplied entirely by electricity generated from renewable resources and other non-carbon-based energy carriers, many mobile applications will continue to rely on carbon-based fuels due to their high volumetric and gravimetric energy density.168
Making and use of polycarbonates, polyols and polyurethanes: applications in the materials sector
Organic carbonates are used in multifaceted applications as bulk chemicals and in the materials sector.169 Carbonate groups are key constituents of high-performance polymers, such as polycarbonates170 and polyethercarbonate-based polyurethanes.171 Already nowadays, organic carbonates are produced mostly by reacting CO2 with a suitable co-reagent, as, e.g., epoxides.172,173 Energy-rich co-reagents enable the chemical conversion of the thermodynamically stable CO2 molecule.144
Dimethylcarbonate, the smallest alkyl carbonate, is produced on a scale of 0.09 mio. t a−1 mostly for captive use in the production of polycarbonates (∼50%).174 Aliphatic polycarbonates, conventionally obtained by transesterification of dimethylcarbonate with aliphatic diols, can also be produced by co-polymerization of CO2 and epoxides.175–180 Alternating polypropylenecarbonate is characterized by a relatively low glass transition temperature of ∼37 °C which limits the application field. With double metal cyanide catalysts, non-alternating hydroxyl-terminated aliphatic polycarbonate polyols with molecular weights in the oligomer range (<20000 g mol−1) are obtained.181,182 With a glass transition temperature of below −10 °C and characterized by low viscosity, oligomeric polyethercarbonate polyols are readily processed to polyurethanes.171 Polyethercarbonate polyols, thus, can substitute for polyether polyols, a bulk intermediate with a global production of 8 mio. t a−1 in 2012. With an average 20 wt% CO2 incorporated, up to 1.6 mio. t CO2 a−1 could be utilized as feedstock.
Recent pilot plants for synthesizing organic carbonates are taking on opportunities in the commodity and specialty market. Dimethylcarbonate production by the transesterification of CO2-derived ethylene carbonate has been commercialized in the early 2000s by Asahi.183 Shell has built a 500 t a−1-scale pilot plant in 2011 to produce diphenyl carbonate on Jurong Island, Singapore.186,187 Moreover, Novomer is marketing alternating polypropylenecarbonate comprising 40–50 wt% CO2.188,189 SK Energy has built a plant for producing polypropylenecarbonate and has introduced co-laminate films with polypropylene providing the material with low oxygen-diffusion and good mechanical stability.190 More recently, Covestro has opened a plant for producing polyethercarbonate polyols with a 5000 t a−1 capacity in 2016.191
A cradle-to-grave analysis concerns the production of polyethercarbonate polyols including the upstream processes.185 Production of polyethercarbonate polyols with 20 wt% of CO2 results in emissions of 2.7–2.9 kg CO2-eq. per kg.185 The CO2 thereby substitutes for the energy-rich epoxide. Furthermore, in the production of conventional polyether polyols, the environmental impact originates mostly from epoxide production. The polyethercarbonate polyol with 20 wt% CO2 allows for an 11–19% lower environmental impact and 13–16% reduced use of fossil raw materials compared to conventional polyether polyols.185 Per 1 kg of polyethercarbonate polyol produced, 3 kg of CO2 emissions are avoided. Interestingly, also other environmental impacts are lowered (Fig. 10). The use of bio-derived chain transfer reagents represents another option to increase the sustainable content.184 A polyethercarbonate polyol with 1000 g mol−1 and 12 wt% CO2 has a sustainable content solely associated with the incorporated CO2 (12 wt%). The propylene glycol chain transfer reagent can be obtained from bio-derived feedstock, increasing the renewable content to 19.6 wt%. Use of glycerol, tartaric aid or citric acid as chain transfer reagent enables raising the sustainable content to 21, 27 and 31 wt%, respectively (Fig. 10).184 Noteworthy is that the higher functionality f of the chain transfer reagent (f2 → f4) gives access to new application fields.
 Fig. 10  Towards sustainable production of polyols, environmental impact of propylene glycol-based polyethercarbonate polyol (20 wt% CO2) compared to a conventional polyol (top) and impact of sustainable chain-transfer reagents on the content of sustainable feedstock (bottom, analysis for polyol 1000 g mol−1, 12 wt% CO2); adapted from ref. 184 and 185. 
The production of the energy-rich co-reagents that enable the conversion of CO2 to carbonates is associated with significant CO2 emissions. Consequently, a source of carbon-free energy and improved technologies to produce these co-reagents is required to enable the carbon-neutral production of organic carbonates from CO2. Together with a long use-time of the corresponding products, carbonates have the potential to be a temporary carbon-storage.
Making and use of methanol: applications in the chemical sector
Methanol is one of the most important large-volume platform chemicals. The currently more than 90 methanol plants comprise a production capacity of 75 Mio. t a−1.114 Conventionally, methanol is produced from synthesis gas using a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst at 200–300 °C and 50–100 bar.192 Synthesis gas, in turn, is produced by reforming of methane at temperatures of up to 1000 °C.193 With a reaction enthalpy of +206 kJ mol−1,194 the typically applied steam reforming195,196 is strongly endothermal and constitutes a particularly energy intensive step in conventional methanol production. At present, carbon dioxide is increasingly considered as feedstock for methanol production.172,197 Upon switching from CO to CO2 as carbon source, a higher percentage of hydrogen has to be fed to the reactor, because the higher oxygen content of CO2 results in more water formed as by-product. Thus, to produce 1 t methanol, 1.46 t carbon dioxide and 0.20 t hydrogen have to be provided as feedstock.198 Hereby, water (0.57 t) is formed as by-product. Additionally, 0.17 MW h electric energy, 0.44 MW h heat and 0.86 MW h cooling power have to be provided to produce 1 t of methanol.
In a life cycle assessment (LCA), the production of CO2-based methanol was compared with conventional methanol production (Fig. 11).199 The environmental impact was calculated as the so-called global warming impact (GWI), i.e. the CO2 equivalents (CO2,eq) that would have to be emitted to result in the same global warming. The 1.375 kg CO2 required as feedstock for producing 1 t MeOH were considered to be taken from carbon capture of a power plant which produces 1.273 kW h electricity. For conventionally synthesized methanol, an equivalent electricity output was considered to allow for a proper comparison base.200 The way hydrogen is produced has a particular impact on the sustainability of the process chain. When hydrogen is produced by water electrolysis201 using electricity obtained with wind energy, a much lower GWI of 0.38 CO2,eq per tMeOH is calculated. When solar energy is used to produce the electricity required for hydrogen production, the GWI is 1.39 CO2,eq per tMeOH. By considering the present efficiency of solar cells, the GWI is comparable to conventional methanol production with a GWI of 1.41 CO2,eq per tMeOH. When hydrogen is produced in the conventional way by steam reforming of fossil natural gas, the GWI, 2.42 CO2,eq per tMeOH, is significantly higher. Thus, the entire process chain and the boundary conditions have to be taken into account.
 Fig. 11  Carbon footprint (top) of CO2-based methanol production (left) and conventional methanol production (right) under the system boundaries shown on the bottom. * fluxes refer to the scenario I with wind energy and hydrogen generation by electrolysis. 
For converting CO2 to methanol, a minimum energy of 4.433 kW h per tCO2 is required.202 Of that energy, about 2/3 are electricity and 1/3 heat. How the electricity is produced greatly affects the CO2 emissions associated with converting CO2. Using electricity generated from a coal power plant (46% LHV efficiency, emissions 740 gCO2 kW−1 h−1) results in CO2 emissions of 1.8 tCO2 per ton of converted CO2. Likewise, taking into account the 2011 grid average of the USA (503 g kW−1 h−1) or of Germany (477 g kW−1 h−1), there is no net uptake of CO2. By contrast, with electricity from a zero-carbon source, net CO2 emissions of 0.6 tCO2 per ton of converted CO2 would result in a net uptake. However, also the heat supply has to considered. Only at some sites is heat generated from carbon-neutral resources. In other words, the CO2 released during heat generation has to be taken into account. Consequently, a significant change in boundary conditions is required to enable carbon-neutral production of methanol from CO2. If realised and with the cost of H2 production by electrolysis assumed to decrease to 0.14 € Nm−3, methanol could be produced at a cost of 0.30–0.35 € kg−1.203 Recalculated to an equivalent energy of diesel fuel, this corresponds to 0.94–1.10 € kg−1 solar fuel.168
Making and use of liquid fuels by CO2-based Fischer–Tropsch synthesis: applications in the energy sector
Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis is a commercial route for producing hydrocarbons from syngas. Control of feedstock composition, catalyst204,205 reaction conditions206,207 and reactor design208 offers the possibility to obtain a variety of saturated or unsaturated petrochemical products.209 The reaction involves stepwise insertion of CO into a growing hydrocarbon chain, followed by reduction and hydrogenolysis of the C–O bond. The relative rates of chain growth and termination determine the average length of the hydrocarbon chain. The length of the carbon chain in the main products, alkanes, alkenes and/or oxygenates can be described frequently as an Anderson–Schulz–Flory distribution.210,211 At a chain growth probability of α = 0.8, the proportion of C5–C15 hydrocarbons reaches a maximum of 60%. Fischer–Tropsch alkanes are high-quality fuels free of sulphur and aromatic compounds.
In principle, the feed can be switched from a CO/H2 syngas mixture to a mixture of CO2 and hydrogen.212,213 However, the change to CO2 requires a fundamental modification of the FT technology. Due to the formation of water as by-product, the percentage of H2 in the feed needs to be raised. Compared to the classic FT synthesis, harsher reaction conditions are required for CO2-based FT synthesis. On a microkinetic level, various pathways are conceivable for CO2-based FT synthesis. One pathway involves reduction of CO2 to CO by reverse water-gas-shift followed by FT synthesis.214 Similar to CO, CO2 may also be inserted into the growing hydrocarbon chain followed by hydrogenolytic cleavage of the CO bond as well as the C–O bond of the resulting carboxylate end group. Likewise, other pathways that combine partial reduction of CO2, insertion and hydrogenolysis are conceivable.
For producing synthetic fuel equivalent to 1 MJ by CO2-based FT synthesis, 2.9 MJ of electricity are required as primary energy source,215 if the energy is solely provided by photovoltaics and only CO2 and water are used a feedstock. Compared to the production cost for conventional diesel of 0.80 US$ l−1 and gasoline of 0.73 US$ l−1, the production cost of FT fuel of 1.6–1.9 US$ l−1 exceeds at present the conventional route.209 Consequently, a source of carbon-free electricity as well as a change in boundary conditions are required to enable carbon-neutral production of FT products from CO2.
Closing the cycle
Although CO2 is abundant on earth, the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere suggests that we likewise consider carbon as a valuable resource. According to the saturation hypothesis, the quantity of durable materials being used by society at a given time tends to plateau once a certain level of per capita income has been obtained.216 After an adequate stock has been built up, a certain level of fresh material is required to replace and maintain this level. For iron and steel, this steady-state level is at around 10 t per person. Similarly, carbon could to be seen as a long-term resource.
Closure of the required anthropogenic carbon cycles can be achieved by direct or indirect recycling of the carbon contained in the corresponding substance (Fig. 6): (i) Materials can be used again at the end of their use phase in the same or in alternative applications. Typically, this involves downgrading of the application field, and prior workup of the material at the end of its life may be required. (ii) An alternative path is to break the chemical entities contained in the material into smaller units to rebuild more complex structures within the established or modified industrial value chains. While this analysis holds for material and chemical applications, (iii) use of carbon-based fuels in the energy sector intrinsically involves combustion with atmospheric oxygen. Likewise, materials and chemicals can be used energetically at the end of their lifespan. Even so, carbon dioxide separated from the effluent gas streams can be used directly in new value chains. Moreover, CO2 can be used as feedstock for chemical processes. Other captive applications comprise physical uses of CO2 such as working fluids in technical applications such as refrigerators. At the end of life of the corresponding device, the CO2 can be collected and reused. Common to the recycling of materials and chemicals and the energetic or physical reuse with included CO2 capture is that the carbon contained in the materials, chemicals or fuels is maintained in a closed cycle.
Many other applications necessitate that, at the end of life, CO2 is released back into the atmosphere. An example are the manifold small-scale combustion units, especially for mobile applications. Likewise, CO2 is liberated quickly, when CO2 is applied for short-term uses like for carbonating soda water. Moreover, physical uses of CO2, such as in fire extinguishers, frequently implies open applications and release of CO2 into the atmosphere. In all these cases, the same amount of carbon has to be removed from the atmosphere to balance the amount of carbon contained there as carbon dioxide.
Sinks for carbon
To balance the net flux through anthropogenic carbon cycles, an equivalent to the excess carbon that is fed freshly into the cycles needs to be redeposited in long-term sinks. Especially for the atmosphere, the influx and the net removal of CO2 have to be balanced, if the CO2 level is to be levelled. However, the present CO2 emissions considerably exceed the rate of the CO2 uptake in sinks. Thus, anthropogenic long-term sinks need to be established that have sufficient scale and entail extended binding time for the contained carbon. One example involving long-term use of materials is the construction sector. Mimicking the natural carbon binding mechanism, CO2 can be reacted with minerals such as MgO and MgSiO4 to the corresponding carbonates. Concrete can take up significant amounts of CO2, if the binder cement is made from silicates or other non-carbon-based raw materials. Another example involves the use of the CO2 to grow additional biomass.127 However, this can only be considered a sink, when the biomass is subsequently applied in long-term applications and, finally, stowed away. Only to a certain degree can mankind rely upon carbon to be taken up by natural sinks such as the natural carbon fixation process of the oceans.123–126 The increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration since the onset of industrialisation is a clear indicator that the natural carbon fixation rate is much smaller than the release of carbon through anthropogenic activities. Nevertheless, the actual rate of long-term natural carbonization processes needs to be verified. Even though on a medium term, the uptake of CO2 into the oceans is the main carbon sink, it leads to their acidification. In the long term, however, excess carbon will have to be placed back into geologic formations and rock formations. One option for such geological sequestration may involve dissolution of CO2 into saline aquifers.217 There, the carbonic acid slowly reacts with the surrounding rock. Overall, allowing for the presence of sources and sinks will make a future circular economy more robust.
Energy supply driving the anthropogenic carbon cycle
Lastly, for closing the carbon cycles, energy is required to feed the carbon back into the industrial value chains. Sustainable cycles will have to be driven by energy from renewable resources (Fig. 12). The most abundant renewable resource is solar energy that is available globally on a scale of 6500 TW a−1.218 Moreover, wind energy, 1700 TW a−1,218 geothermal energy 200 TW a−1 and on a smaller, yet significant scale, tidal energy, 2.8 TW a−1,219 and wave energy, 2 TW a−1,220 are available. If only a fraction of less than 0.2% of the overall available renewable energy were extracted, the entire worldwide energy demand of 12.5 TW a−1 (ref. 218) could be covered.
 Fig. 12  Present primary energy demand in comparison to the renewable energy available worldwide, global distribution of solar energy (top), wind energy (bottom). For references refer to the text. 
The fluctuating supply of renewable energy has to be balanced with the demand that is also varying but offset relative to the supply.168,221 Wind energy fluctuates widely and often unpredictably (Fig. 13 (ref. 222)). The availability of solar energy varies daily according to the relative location of the sun (Fig. 13 (ref. 222)) and annually with the seasons. In comparison to the other energy resources, geothermal, wave and tidal energy benefit from a more predictable potential for power generation.223
 Fig. 13  Fluctuating availability of renewable energy in Germany, week 5, 2019 and contribution of energy sources from renewable and fossil origin (insert, in TW h); the marked day refers to 0:00 h. 
To balance the supply and demand of energy, storage of large amounts of energy is inevitable.224–227 Technologies for storing energy can be divided into physical and chemical methods. Conventionally, larger amounts of electric energy are stored as hydroelectric energy by pumping water from a lower level to a reservoir at higher altitude. While the stored energy can be accessed rapidly, regions with sufficient storage capacity are limited to suitable mountainous landscapes.228,229 Also other forms of storing energy in physical form, such as compressed gases in large underground caverns,230 and supercapacitors,231 have been considered. While these technologies are justified in specific settings, the quantity of energy does not suffice to store electric energy over a two-week period of calm or to balance the availability of energy between the seasons. Thus, other forms of energy need to be equally considered. Among the physical methods, sorption heat storage has the potential for storing larger amounts of thermal energy.232,233
In comparison to most physical methods, chemical conversions are associated with much larger changes in energy.234 Storage of energy in reduced form in carbon compounds provides a good choice, since there is no need to transport the redox partner oxygen, which is abundant in the air, together with the hydrocarbon. Table 2 gives an overview of the energy content of selected hydrocarbons. High gravimetric and volumetric storage densities are obtained with liquid hydrocarbons. Gaseous hydrocarbons can provide an even higher gravimetric density at the expense of the volumetric energy density. Increasing the volumetric energy density by compression or liquefaction requires additional energy in charging the energy storage. Alternative methods for storing larger amounts of gases involve the reversible formation of clathrates235,236 or absorption within porous materials.237,238 In particular for methane, there is a large storage infrastructure in place today. In Europe the working gas capacity totals 1.48 × 1011 m3.239 The global gas storage capacity is estimated at 3.60 × 1011 m3.239 Furthermore, there is an existing logistics chain to maintain a balance between supply and demand. Thus, countries like Germany can hold roughly 1/3 of their annual gas demand in stock.239

Why is carbon so important for energy storage and why are only few other elements considered? Light-weight elements with interesting redox couples involve mostly hydrogen, lithium, fluorine and nitrogen. Heavier elements involve larger masses that have to be converted. Consequently, the corresponding compounds are less suitable, at least for mobile applications. Among the light-weight elements, molecular hydrogen has a relatively high gravimetric, but low volumetric energy density. The status of technologies for storing hydrogen has been reviewed recently.243 Lithium is applied widely in lithium batteries.244,245 The use of lithium batteries has grown tremendously in recent years.246 Fluorides as active electrode materials for the next generation batteries have been suggested,247,248 but are less developed. Reduction of nitrogen to ammonia is technically applied on a wide scale. Ammonia can be burned with oxygen in a reaction with high reaction enthalpy. Nitrogen as product can be released into the air. Although the oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen oxides involves an even higher reaction enthalpy, these products are corrosive gases that are challenging to handle and would, thus, be challenging to be fed back into recycle loops.
Based on this analysis, it is not surprising that also plants store solar energy harvested during photosynthesis in reduced form in carbon compounds. Plants store their energy mostly in form of starch,249,250 a complex carbohydrate that in the cells is stockpiled in storage organelles (vacuoles). Starch, consisting of glucose as building block, has a relatively high energy density of 16.5 kJ kg−1.242 Relative to hydrogen, it has a mass-based storage density of 14.8 wt% H2 and a volumetric density of 104 kg H2 per m3 starch.251 When the cells need to access the stored energy, the starch is broken down into simple carbohydrates that enter the mitochondria to release the stored energy during the Krebs cycle. Nearly all animals and non-green life forms (such as fungi and bacteria) depend on the stored energy of green plants to live.
For technical applications, emerging technologies for energy storage comprise power-to-gas and power-to-liquid. Hydrogen produced with renewable energy is reacted with carbon dioxide to methane that is fed to the gas grid. Thereby the enormous storage capacity of the gas grid can be utilized.252,253 Also power-to-liquid is an emerging technology.201 By a variant of the Fischer–Tropsch technology, liquid hydrocarbons are produced. As discussed above, the latter are well-suited for energy storage.
For mobile applications, electromobility with lithium ion batteries is becoming a widely available technology.254 At present, the large weight of the battery due the lower gravimetric energy density restricts the radius that can be covered by the vehicle. In comparison, fuel cells255 that are operated with gaseous or liquid feedstock are currently less in the focus. In particular, fuel cells running with hydrogen are a very clean technology, since nearly no by-products other than water are formed.256 Moreover, methane is a suitable gaseous feedstock. Some fuel cells run on liquid fuels such as methanol or liquid hydrocarbons that are more readily transportable.
Redox flow batteries are being developed mostly for stationary applications.257–259 With electrical energy, a liquid containing suitable chemical entities is reduced to be stored for long periods of time. By re-oxidation in the electrochemical cell, the energy is converted back to electricity. Classic redox couples used in redox flow batteries involve vanadium compounds.260 More recently, organic redox couples, have been considered.261–263 A non-aqueous medium is required to give the sufficiently wide electrochemical window.264,265
Outlook
Today, our economy is being deeply transformed by changes in the energy supply and availability of raw materials. In particular regarding the current predominant use of fossil carbon sources in the manufacturing industry, chemical industry, and the energy sector, a long-term shift to a sustainable, cycle-oriented economy is inevitable. Nonetheless, carbon-based materials and fuels will continue to be indispensable in the future. Thus, systematic research in the design of future industrial solutions is needed. Based on a fundamental understanding of the fluxes of carbon-based materials,266 it is crucial to create innovative and sustainable value chains and optimal routes for implementing the energy transition and establishing sustainable economic structures. Industrial carbon sources need to be re-evaluated within the changed boundary conditions; advanced chemical and structural analysis will trigger insights into the transformation of organic materials. Novel material transformations have to be further developed based on highly efficient industrial catalysts, optimal process engineering, and within the framework of process chains proven to be ideal through system analysis. The most promising process steps then need to be implemented in industrial processes. Consequently, it is essential to spur cutting-edge research approaches and evaluation of development chains.
Inspired by the twelve principles of green chemistry267 and the twelve principles of CO2 utilization,268 we would like to advance the following propositions that may help as a guide along the path towards shaping a future circular economy:
1. Concerning resources, a future circular economy should rely primarily on renewable carbon resources that can quickly be regenerated.
2. For making materials, chemicals and energy carriers, the most carbon-effective method should be employed to produce just as much products as are needed. Production should be aimed at long lifetimes of products that ideally can be fully recycled at the end of their use phase.
3. During the use phase, the products should be utilized in the best carbon-efficient manner as possible, ensuring that products are used and disposed of in such a way that prevents the carbon from leaving the intended cycle. The decision to replace a product by a more energy-efficient product needs to be balanced with the quantity of carbon released during the production of the replacement product.
4. At the end of the use phase, it is better to contain the carbon in an anthropogenic carbon cycle. Direct or indirect recycling is preferred as compared to closing the cycle via carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. When carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, the same amount needs to be removed to balance the cycle.
5. Thus, it is essential to promote cultivation of plants that fosters the natural binding of carbon in nature. Furthermore, carbon dioxide should be employed as raw material wherever feasible. Hydrogen generated with renewable energy resources is a matter of choice when reduction of the carbon centre in carbon dioxide is necessary.
6. The energy needed to drive anthropogenic carbon cycles needs to stem as much as possible from carbon-neutral resources. To balance energy supply and demand, new technologies for energy storage need to be implemented.
7. Carbonaceous materials that cannot be recycled should be disposed of with minimum effort and sequestered permanently. The same amount of carbon that is fed freshly into the cycle needs to be deposited in long-term net carbon sinks.
Introducing a so-called “Emission Trading System”168 (EU-ETS) or levying a carbon tax269 are policy instruments to incentivize industries to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thus, several countries have introduced a carbon tax (Table 3). Economic studies indicate that a carbon tax on a moderate level can trigger sizable reductions in GHG emissions and stimulate new economic activities.270,271

Conclusions
Focusing on carbon as an essential element of life, this paper has presented and evaluated the carbon inventory on earth, carbon fluxes throughout the different geo-habitats, as well as pathways towards establishing anthropogenic carbon cycles. In the future, carbon should be seen as a valuable resource that should be kept within anthropogenic carbon cycles. At the end of their life, carbon-containing materials and goods, thus, should be fed back into the cycles. Due to their specific properties, carbon-containing fuels will still be used despite their intrinsic CO2 emissions. Even so, it is crucial that the world community stops considering the atmosphere as a sink for CO2. Consequently, even if the CO2 is released into the air, an equal amount of CO2 has to be removed permanently. Ultimately, the CO2 molecule may be seen in a new light—as an abundant and sustainable carbon source that provides many new opportunities for future value-chains. The necessary processing steps need to be driven by renewable energy. A starting point may be establishing a hydrogen economy based on energy from sustainable resources. Together with CO2, hydrogen is an excellent starting point for producing methanol and other chemical intermediates as well as fuels. To create these future circular value chains, proper process design and thorough evaluation of the technologies is required. Moreover, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been shown to be a valuable tool for evaluating the carbon footprint while also considering other environmental impact categories. Cradle-to-grave or gate-to-gate assessments allow to consider entire value chains or to focus on specific aspects for identifying suitable targets (Fig. 14). To prompt the necessary economic changes, we encourage constructive and creative thought in terms of a circular economy which increasingly incorporates renewables in the ecological and economic cost-benefit analysis.

Table Content:
P. Tomkins	Patrick Tomkins received his M.S. degree in chemistry in 2015 from RWTH Aachen University where he was project student under the supervision of Thomas Müller in the CAT Catalytic Center. He performed his Master thesis about the isothermal conversion of methane to methanol in the group of Prof. van Bokhoven. He currently is finishing his Ph.D. research at KU Leuven in the group of Prof. De Vos on the conversion of phenol to anilines.
T. E. Müller	Prof. Dr. Thomas E. Müller (MRSC) is full professor at Ruhr-Universität Bochum. After studying chemistry at LMU München and ETH Zürich, he received his PhD from ICL London followed by research positions at University of Sussex and TU Munich and visiting professor positions at NUS Singapore and University of Tokyo. He then worked for 12 years for Bayer MaterialScience, later Covestro in process development. In parallel, he was head of CAT Catalytic Center, a joint venture of Covestro with RWTH Aachen University. In 2018, he moved back to academia accepting a teaching position at RFH Köln and, since March 2019, is incumbent of the chair Carbon Sources and Conversion at Ruhr-Universität Bochum. His research interests are centered at establishing new process chains for efficient use of carbon.
