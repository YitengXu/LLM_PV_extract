This morphology is achieved via high-concentration TiCl4 treatment of upright backbone nanowires (NWs) followed by hydrothermal growth. Secondary nanobranches grow in all directions from densely distributed, needle-like seeds on the jagged round surface of the backbone NWs. In addition, hierarchical, flower-like branches grow on the top surface of each NW, greatly increasing the surface area. For dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications, the TiO2 nanostructure demonstrated a photoconversion efficiency of up to 6.2%. A parametric study of the DSSC efficiency showed that branched TiO2 DSSCs can achieve nearly four times the efficiency of non-branched TiO2 nanowire DSSCs, and up to 170% the efficiency of previously-reported sparsely-branched TiO2 NW DSSCs.1. IntroductionThe development of a photoelectrode composed of various types of nanostructures in order to achieve large surface area, enhanced photoactivity and high crystallinity is one of the main issues in optoelectronic and photocatalysis applications including photovoltaics,1,2 antireflective layer,3,4 sensors,5–7 water splitting.8,9 TiO2 has been extensively studied as a core material for such applications as it is physicochemically stable, non-corrosive, and cost effective along with a wide band gap. TiO2 nanostructures have garnered significant interest for water-splitting hydrogen generation since the Honda–Fujishima effect was reported.10 Also, among the nanomaterials, TiO2 still exhibits the highest power conversion efficiency in DSSC applications while ZnO NW DSSCs have shown limited photoconversion efficiencies due to their low stability in the carboxylic anchoring groups of the sensitizer.11 Nanoparticle (NP) is the most common nanostructure of TiO2 for applications in conventional Grätzel-type solar cells.2,12–14 However, once electrons are generated, they suffer recombination at the NP interfaces where the electron diffusion is retarded.15 Thus, many efforts have concentrated on overcoming this limitation by using one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures such as nanowires (NWs)16–18 and nanotubes (NTs)19–21 which provide a direct pathway for electrons to the electrode. 1D TiO2 nanostructures have been actively investigated and several synthesis methods have been reported such as hydrothermal growth,17,22 anodizing,20,23 electrospinning,24 and acid vapor oxidation (AVO).25 As reported in previous studies,17,22,26,27 TiO2 NWs grown by the hydrothermal method generally have a rutile crystal structure, whereas hydrothermally grown anatase TiO2 structures have been reported very recently.4,28 The rutile phase is generally known to exhibit comparable performance to the anatase phase, yet with better chemical stability and a higher refractive index29,30 thereby providing suitable properties for applications such as DSSCs. Since Feng et al.17 and Liu et al.22 reported hydrothermal synthesis methods of TiO2 NWs directly on transparent conductive substrates, 1D TiO2 nanostructures and their variations expanding the 1D shape into 3D31–34 are increasingly being developed for optoelectronic devices. Fewer variations of 3D nanostructures of TiO2 have been demonstrated in contrast to the wide variety of ZnO nanomaterials that include nanoforests,32,33 nanoflowers,35 and nanotetrapods.36 More recently, to achieve enhanced photocatalytic activity with higher surface-to-volume ratio, several studies have focused on multidimensional and hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures such as nanobranched26,27,37 and nanoflower15 configurations. However, these structures have either tiny or sparsely distributed branches, hence leaving much room for improvement. In this study, we report on the synthesis of hydrothermally grown, omnidirectional, 3D hierarchically-branched and densely-packed TiO2 nanowire photoanodes. TiO2 nanobranches were grown in high density in all directions from chemically-modified, rutile-structure, TiO2-backbone NW surfaces. Parametric studies comparing the DSSC efficiencies show the effect of these structural differences on the photoanode performance.2. Experimental details2.1. Synthesis of TiO2 nanowires with densely-packed and omnidirectional branchesThe omnidirectional, densely-packed, and hierarchically-branched TiO2 nanowire structures (DB: densely branched) were synthesized by the so-called “2 + 1 method”, which comprises two hydrothermal growth steps with an intermediate high-concentration TiCl4 treatment. A schematic illustration of the formation of the DB structure is shown in Fig. 1. To begin, upright TiO2-backbone NWs (LG: lengthwise growth) were grown on a fluorine-doped SnO2 conductive glass (FTO) substrate by the hydrothermal method.22 Although TiO2 NWs can be grown directly on a FTO substrate without any seed layer due to a small lattice mismatch between FTO (a = b = 0.4687 nm)38 and rutile TiO2 (a = b = 0.4594 nm),39 Feng et al.17 observed that TiO2 nanowires grown directly on FTO glass tend to induce electrical shorting with the electrolyte. In addition, in several studies it has been reported that mixed-phase nanocomposites composed of a thin anatase TiO2 layer and rutile TiO2 nanowires show enhanced photocatalytic reactivity.40–44 Thus, a thin anatase TiO2 layer was deposited by drop casting a diluted anatase paste (Solaronix) onto cleaned FTO glass before the hydrothermal NW growth. As a precursor solution, 30 ml of hydrochloric acid aqueous solution (37%, Sigma Aldrich) and 30 ml of distilled water were mixed in a 150 ml PTFE-lined stainless-steel autoclave and stirred for 5 min, followed by the addition of 1 ml of Ti-butoxide [C6H36O4Ti] (97%, Sigma Aldrich). After stirring the solution for another 5 min, LG NWs were grown by immersing the anatase TiO2-coated substrate into the solution in a face-down position and heating for 11 h in an oven pre-heated to 180 °C. The possible underlying mechanism of the TiO2 NW growth from Ti-butoxide or other titanium precursors can be found elsewhere.18,22 After the reaction was complete and the sample had cooled, the TiO2 NWs grown on the substrate were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water and dried. To obtain a densely-seeded surface (DS: densely seeded), the LG sample was immersed in a high concentration (0.2 M) TiCl4 aqueous solution at room temperature overnight. The surface treatment of TiO2 nanostructures via hydrolysis of TiCl4 (TiCl4 + 2H2O → TiO2 + 4HCl) is one of the well-known routes to produce epitaxial growth of rutile layers on the electrode surface. More details of the reaction mechanism can be found in previous reports.27,45,46 In order to grow the NW branches from the seeds on the surface, another hydrothermal process was performed in the same manner as for the LG NW process, this time for 3.5 h. Finally, hierarchical TiO2 NWs with densely-packed and omnidirectional branches (DB: densely branched) were achieved. Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the formation of 3D hierarchically-branched TiO2 NW structures: (a) Lengthwise growth (LG), (b-1) densely-seeded (DS) surface modification via a high-concentration TiCl4 treatment, (b-2) omnidirectional, 3D hierarchically- and densely-branched (DB) TiO2 NWs, (c-1) previously-reported sparsely-seeded (SS) surface modification, (c-2) sparsely-branched (SB) TiO2 nanowires. The cross-section of each structure is also shown. For a parametric study of the DSSC efficiency, sparsely-branched (SB) TiO2 NW photoanodes were also synthesized as a benchmark using a seed preparation method previously reported by Liao and Wu.26 For SB NWs, a premixed solution of 1.7 ml of Ti-isopropoxide [C12H28O4Ti] (Sigma Aldrich) and 2 ml of hydrochloric acid (37%) was mixed with 40 ml of distilled water, after which the LG NWs were placed into the solution for 4 h at 95 °C in order to obtain sparse seeds on the surface (SS: sparsely seeded). Then, another hydrothermal process conducted in the same manner as before for 3.5 h resulted in SB NWs. In order to increase the roughness of each NW surface for higher dye loading, LG, DB, and SB NWs were treated with a mild (0.05 M) TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min (tLG, tDB, and tSB, respectively). As a final step in the NW synthesis, all NW samples were annealed in air at 500 °C for 30 min to remove any residual organics.2.2. Dye-sensitized solar cell fabricationDye loading was conducted by immersing the TiO2 photoanodes into a 0.5 mM ethanolic solution of di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) (N719, Solaronix) dye for 18 h. As counter electrodes, several drops of 0.2 mM ethanolic H2PtCl6 solution were spread onto the FTO substrates, which had been pre-drilled with small holes for electrolyte injection, followed by heating at 400 °C for 30 min. Then, the sensitized photoanodes and counter electrodes were sandwiched and bonded together using 60 μm thick hot-melt foil spacers (Meltonix 1170-60, Solaronix). The iodide-based redox electrolyte (AN 50, Solaronix) was introduced into the cell through the holes in the counter electrode, and then covered and sealed using a thin glass cover slip.3. Results and discussionThe NWs were characterized after each growth step by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 2a, after the first growth step the LG NWs had a diameter of approximately 200 nm and a length of 2.5 μm, with flat, tetragonal crystallographic surfaces. After DS modification by high concentration (0.2 M) TiCl4 aqueous solution treatment, the surface of the LG NWs was modified to feature a jagged circular cross-section and was decorated by needle-like seeds as shown in Fig. 2b. Successive hydrothermal growth of the DS nanowire for 3.5 h resulted in very dense omnidirectional growth of nanobranches, which were approximately 200 nm in length and 30 nm in diameter (DB, Fig. 3a and b). Notably, the DS process induced growth of dense branches on the tip of each NW resulting in a dandelion-like structure greatly increasing the surface area. Contrary to the DS modification and DB structure, the SS treatment retained the square cross section of the backbone NWs as shown in Fig. 4a such that the bundles of nanobranches for the SB NWs grew only in limited directions from the square rutile-type TiO2 NW trunks, as displayed in Fig. 4b. The areal densities of the LG, SB and DB structures calculated from the SEM images are around 1.6 × 109 NWs cm−2, 4.4 × 1011 branch NWs cm−2 and 6 × 1011 branch NWs cm−2 respectively. Considering the areal density and the dimension of each nanowire (LG: 200 nm (diameter) × 2.5 μm (length), SB and DB branch: 30 nm (diameter) × 200 nm (length)), the roughness factors of the LG, SB and DB structures, defined as the ratio of the total surface area of the NW structure to its projected substrate area,37 are calculated to be around 32, 83 and 113 respectively. Fig. 5a and b show higher magnification SEM views of the DB and tDB NWs, respectively, demonstrating an obvious difference in surface roughness by the mild TiCl4 treatment. It is noted that a high-concentration TiCl4 treatment at this step hinders effective dye loading by filling up all narrow spaces between the branches. Therefore, mild TiCl4 treatment conditions should be chosen for an appropriate TiO2 precipitation rate.

The crystal structure of the DB TiO2 NWs has been characterized by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy (excitation wavelength: 532 nm), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). TEM characterization of the NW backbone of the DB TiO2 structures was achieved by removing individual NWs from an LG array. A bright-field TEM image of a single LG NW is shown in Fig. 6a with the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern inset. The diffraction pattern indices to the [10] zone axis of rutile TiO2 indicate that crystal growth occurred in the [001] direction. Fig. 6b shows the tip of an LG NW revealing its constituent nearly-parallel needle-like structures. Fig. 7 shows the TEM results for branches removed from a DB NW array. A single branch is shown in the bright-field TEM image in Fig. 7a. The corresponding SAED pattern for the branch shown in the inset was acquired along the [11] zone axis. Crystal growth in the [001] direction is again concluded. In Fig. 7b a bundle of branches is shown demonstrating the highly dense nature of the branched growth, which prohibited selective imaging of the interface between the NW backbone and a given branch.

Fig. 7  TEM characterization of the branches of DB TiO2 NWs: (a) bright-field TEM image of an individual branch with d110 lattice spacings marked and SAED pattern inset, (b) bundle of branches detached from backbone NW. Fig. 8a and b show XRD patterns and Raman spectra, respectively, for LG, SB, and DB NWs. The similar appearance of the peaks for the three different TiO2 NW types in both the XRD and the Raman characterization demonstrates the strong similarity between their crystal structures. It is worth noting that the anatase phase could only be detected in the Raman spectra, which is attributed to the larger penetration depth of the Raman light source into the thin anatase base layer. We believe that the anatase peaks in the LG, SB, and DB spectra are due to the above-mentioned thin anatase paste layer, which was deposited prior to the hydrothermal growth, since only rutile Raman peaks were detected for the NW arrays grown without the paste layer. Thus, we conclude that the NWs exhibit the rutile phase (confirmed by the TEM analysis above) while the thin paste layer retains the anatase phase. Fig. 8  (a) X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, and (b) Raman shifts for LG, SB, and DB TiO2 structures. DSSC performance was investigated for LG, DB, SB, tLG, tDB, and tSB TiO2 photoanodes. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics as displayed in Fig. 9 were measured under AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination from a solar simulator with an active area of 0.08 cm2 for all cells. Further characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The short circuit current density (JSC) and the overall light conversion efficiency increased for the NW samples in the order LG < tLG < SB < tSB < DB < tDB. While the DSSCs with LG photoanodes attain a photoconversion efficiency of 1.6%, tDB DSSCs show an efficiency of 6.2%, which demonstrates an increase in efficiency by almost four times. Furthermore, the efficiencies of the DSSCs constructed using DB and tDB photoanodes show 170% and 130% higher efficiencies than those using SB and tSB photoanodes, respectively. The efficiency increase is attributed to several effects. First, the densely-packed branches and the enhanced surface roughness resulting from the TiCl4 treatment significantly increase the surface area and hence also the amount of dye loading. Second, omnidirectional branches enable effective photon absorption by preventing photons from passing through the vertical NWs without being absorbed.35 Third, light scattering and trapping enhancement by the high density of branches increases the light harvesting efficiency.33,47 The efficiency ratio of LG, SB and DB DSSCs is in quite good agreement with that of the areal densities above mentioned, which indicates that the surface area increase is the main reason of the efficiency enhancement. It is worth noting that our DB structure has an effective thickness of around 2.7 μm (2.5 μm in length for LG backbone and 200 nm in length for the branches), which is much thinner than the NP photoanode having a thickness of ∼10 μm in the conventional Grätzel-type DSSCs.48 Fig. 9  Comparison of J–V characteristics for DSSCs assembled using the various TiO2 photoanodes grown in this study.

ConclusionsWe have reported omnidirectional, densely-packed, and 3D hierarchically-branched TiO2 nanostructures grown by a hydrothermal method. This morphology was achieved using a high-concentration TiCl4 treatment on upright backbone NWs followed by hydrothermal growth. The branches grew in all directions from a very dense distribution of needle-like seeds on the jagged cylindrical surface of the backbone NWs resulting in a DB structure and increased surface area. The DSSCs fabricated with DB TiO2 photoanodes showed a light conversion efficiency of up to 6.2%, which is almost four times the efficiency of DSSCs constructed using non-branched upright TiO2 NWs, and up to 170% higher than the efficiency of previously-reported sparsely-branched TiO2 NW DSSCs. The densely-branched TiO2 structure may also have potential applications in water splitting, photocatalysis, and gas sensors.AcknowledgementsFinancial support awarded to the University of California, Berkeley, by the U.S. National Science Foundation through the SINAM NSEC, and from the Global Frontier R&D Program (Grant no. 2011-0031569) of the Center for Multiscale Energy System of the NRF of Korea, are gratefully acknowledged.

 	Fig. 3  SEM images of omnidirectional, densely-packed, and 3D hierarchically-branched TiO2 NWs (DB): (a) tilted view, (b) top view. The insets of (a) and (c) show high-magnification images of an individual DB NW.	 

 	Fig. 4  SEM images of (a) TiO2 NWs after sparsely-seeded (SS) surface modification, and (b) sparsely-branched (SB) TiO2 NWs. The insets of (b) show magnified images of individual SB NWs. The blue dashed lines show the direction of the branches with respect to the tetragonal NW backbone surface.	 

 	Fig. 5  SEM images of a DB TiO2 nanowire (a) before, and (b) after mild (0.05 M) TiCl4 treatment.	 

 	Fig. 6  TEM characterization of backbone LG TiO2 NWs: (a) bright-field TEM image of a single LG NW with SAED pattern inset, (b) tip of NW showing needle-like growth.	 

 	Fig. 7  TEM characterization of the branches of DB TiO2 NWs: (a) bright-field TEM image of an individual branch with d110 lattice spacings marked and SAED pattern inset, (b) bundle of branches detached from backbone NW.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, and (b) Raman shifts for LG, SB, and DB TiO2 structures.	 

 	Fig. 9  Comparison of J–V characteristics for DSSCs assembled using the various TiO2 photoanodes grown in this study.
