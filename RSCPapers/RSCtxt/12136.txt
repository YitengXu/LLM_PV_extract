    , Accepted 27th November 2018First published on 30th November 2018AbstractWe report a new route to synthesize high-quality, large-size crystals of CH3NH3PbCl3 through proper selection of DSMO–GBL solution via solvent evaporation method at room temperature. A detailed evaluation of the structural, electronic, optical and electrical properties of these crystals was carried out. Our XPS studies suggested that organic–inorganic halide perovskites are sensitive to X-ray-induced damage, and hence, their properties may get altered. Also, photoluminescence studies displayed two peak spectra, indicating coexistence of order–disorder domains of CH3NH3 in the sample. Further observation of low defect concentration and longer diffusion length indicates that crystals grown by the presented method can offer promising solutions for optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Interest in organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites is driven by their promising applications in low-cost and high-performance optoelectronic devices1–5 due to their low-temperature solution processibility,6,7 strong absorption in ultraviolet–visible region,8 direct and tunable optical band gap,9 high carrier mobility and long diffusion length.10 By altering the cation (A) and halide (X) in the ABX3 structure, many organic and inorganic lead halide perovskite structures have been proposed. Among them, MAPbCl3 (MA = CH3NH3) is one of the less extensively investigated materials for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications due to its low power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared with that of other halide perovskites.11–15 However, MAPbCl3 was found to be a good candidate for visible-blind UV detector because of its large band gap and limited absorption of the solar spectrum.14,15 Hence, it is essential to synthesize high-quality, well-shaped and defect-free single crystals of MAPbCl3 and have proper understanding of its photophysical properties for its use in optoelectronic devices, which include photovoltaic devices,1 LEDs,2 photodetectors,3 X-ray and gamma-ray detectors.4 Till now, literature reports only two methods to synthesize single crystals of MAPbCl3; one is the solution temperature lowering method (STL)11–13 and the other is the inverse temperature crystallization method (ITC).14,15 The single crystals of hybrid perovskites grown by the above two methods are not necessarily defect-free crystals; the crystals grown by the antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization (AVC) method are defect-free single crystals,10 but the use of an additional solvent can create impurity and also enhance the capital cost. An alternate method is the solvent evaporation method. Aromatic ((benzylammonium)2PbCl4) and aliphatic (MA2Pb(SCN)2I2) 2D perovskite crystals were synthesized by Liao et al. and Daub et al., respectively, following this method.16,17
In this paper, we have demonstrated a new route to synthesize MAPbCl3 single crystals at room temperature without adding antisolvent. To achieve our goal, a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) (1:1 volume ratio) was used as the solvent in which lead(II) chloride (PbCl2) and methylammonium chloride (MACl) were dissolved, and the precursor solution was kept at room temperature without any disturbance. MAPbCl3 is highly soluble in DMSO and sparingly soluble in GBL. Further, GBL (204 °C) has a higher boiling point than DMSO (189 °C). Thus, DMSO vaporizes much faster than GBL at room temperature and steers to have a more anti-solvent contained reaction mixture condition, eventually leading to the growth of rectangular shaped (8 × 5 × 1 mm3), highly transparent, colorless and high-quality MAPbCl3 single crystals (Fig. 1) within four weeks. Phase stability, lattice parameter and phase transition temperatures of the grown crystals were investigated through heat capacity and X-ray diffraction (XRD), both single crystal and powder XRD, measurements. Detailed analysis of the electronic, optical and charge transport properties of the as-synthesized sample was carried out using photoelectron spectroscopy, UV–visible absorbance, temperature-dependent steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and I–V characteristics studies. Furthermore, we explored the optical and electrical properties to estimate the energy band levels, exciton binding energy, lifetime, carrier mobility and diffusion length, which are essential parameters for understanding the possible utilization of this material in practical applications.

Experimental methods
Single crystals of MACl were synthesized by reacting CH3NH2 and HCl in the molar ratio of 1.2:1. HCl was added dropwise into CH3NH2 in a flask (under nitrogen atmosphere) kept in an ice bath and stirred for 3 h; the resulting solution was evaporated at 60 °C in a rotary evaporator to remove the unreacted solvent and white crystals of MACl were obtained. Further, 2.78 g PbCl2 (1 M) and 0.67 g MACl (1 M) were dissolved in a mixture of DMSO (5 ml) and GBL (5 ml) (1:1 volume ratio) and this precursor solution was kept at room temperature without any disturbance. Rectangular shaped, highly transparent, colorless and high-quality MAPbCl3 single crystals were grown within two weeks. Keeping the same chemical environment for two more weeks resulted in the growth of larger crystals of (8 mm × 5 mm × 1 mm) size. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement of the as-grown sample was carried out with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation to confirm the 3D perovskite phase of the sample. Furthermore, a detailed and high-resolution structural investigation of the single crystals was carried out at XRD1 beamline at Elettra Synchrotron Light Source, Trieste, Italy using a wavelength of λ = 0.96864 Å to confirm their phase purity, and Rietveld refinement was performed using the Fullprof software to identify the lattice constants. Single crystal XRD measurements were performed on an Oxford Xcalibur (Mova) diffractometer equipped with an EOS CCD detector using Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Data collection, data reduction and numerical absorption corrections were performed using the programs present in the CrysAlisPro software suite. Crystal structures were refined by using SHELXL-97 program present in the WinGX suite. To illustrate the temperature-dependent phase transition and identify the accurate phase transition temperatures, heat capacity measurement of MAPbCl3 was recorded in the physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) Evercool II, from Quantum Design, USA. Measurements were performed in the temperature range between 100 K and 280 K with a 0.5 K point density in the region of interest. Photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed on PHI-5000 Versaprobe II Scanning XPS microprobe using monochromatic Al Kα radiation at room temperature.18 Temperature-dependent steady-state and time-dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements were acquired using FL920 spectrometer from Edinburg instruments in the temperature range from 100 K to 300 K. For these measurements, pellets made from ground crystals were mounted on a copper plate in a cryostat (Oxford, UK) and cooled to 100 K using liquid nitrogen. Xenon lamp with 325 nm wavelength was used as the excitation source for steady-state measurements. To determine the current–voltage characteristics of the MAPbCl3 crystals (8 × 5 × 0.4 mm3), hole only devices were obtained by vapor deposition of 80 nm gold electrodes on both sides. The space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement was performed using Keithley source-meter in the dark, under vacuum at room temperature.
Results and discussion
I. X-ray diffraction (XRD)

Fig. 1(a) depicts the synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of MAPbCl3 acquired at room temperature along with the corresponding Rietveld refined data using Pmm space group superimposed on it. The reasonably small values of reliability parameters indicate good quality of fitting (Table 1) with lattice parameter of a = 5.6834 Å, which is consistent with the literature reports.14 XRD pattern recorded from the top surface of the crystal is depicted in the inset of Fig. 1(a). The appearance of only (100) hkl reflections and its higher orders confirm the single crystalline nature of our sample. The refinement of single crystal X-ray diffraction and some random snap-shots during measurement are presented as supporting document. Refined single crystal structure data from our single crystal sample is accepted in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) data base with no: CCDC 1872901. Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites also exhibit crystallographic phase transitions from cubic to tetragonal to orthorhombic phases with decrease in temperature due to the reduction of MA orientation inside the PbX6 octahedra.19 This can be traced from heat capacity measurements performed on MAPbCl3 single crystal as depicted in Fig. 1(b), which shows anomalies at 172.39 K and 167.02 K related to crystallographic phase transition from cubic to tetragonal phase and tetragonal to orthorhombic phase, respectively.12

II. Photoemission spectroscopy
Survey spectrum acquired using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements is shown in Fig. 2(a), which contains all the expected constituent elements of the perovskite sample studied. A more detailed narrow scan spectra of Cl 2p and Pb 4f core levels are presented in Fig. 2(b) and (c), respectively. The Cl 2p spectrum consists of the spin–orbit split Cl 2p3/2 and Cl 2p1/2 components separated by 1.61 eV with the Cl 2p3/2 peak appearing at the binding energy value of 198.1 eV with FWHM of 0.9 eV, suggesting that Cl is in the Cl−1 oxidation state. Further, the Pb 4f core level spectrum with Pb 4f7/2 peak at 138.8 eV (FWHM of 0.8 eV) suggests Pb to be in the +2 oxidation state. However, the appearance of small peaks at higher binding energies of 136.6 eV and 141.4 eV were observed in the Pb 4f region after prolonged measurements (Fig. 2(c)). It needs to be noted that in the first few spectral acquisitions, the intensity of these additional peaks were negligible, while their intensity increased with the exposure time (30 minutes), confirming beam-induced damage to the sample due to X-rays. Lindblad et al. have previously reported the observation of these minor peaks and assigned them to metallic lead.20 We believe that the X-ray-induced damage has resulted in the removal of halide ions/creation of defects or uncoordinated lead halides in the exposed region leading to the formation of free lead. Hence, adequate precautions should be taken while performing the experiments as well as data analysis involving intense X-ray beams in this class of materials. The valence band (VB) spectrum acquired from this MAPbCl3 crystal is depicted in Fig. 2(d) with an enlarged view of the band edge region shown in the inset. The main feature of VB between 2.5–7 eV arises due to nonbonding Cl 3p orbitals, along with dominant contributions from antibonding Pb 6s and Cl 3p states, as observed from band structure calculations.20

III. Optical studies

Fig. 3(a) shows the optical absorption spectrum acquired for MAPbCl3 single crystal. The spectrum consists of three features; (a) ultralow sub-bandgap absorption at room temperature from a pellet made by crushing the tail at higher wavelength; (b) strong peak at 411 nm (3.02 eV) and (c) band to band transition around 393 nm (3.15 eV), similar to the results on MAPbCl3 films observed by Kumawat et al.9 For further understanding, systematic temperature-dependent PL studies were carried out on the same MAPbCl3 sample between 100 K and 300 K, and the outcome of these measurements are summarized in Fig. 3(b). Intensities of all the spectra are normalized and vertically translated for a clearer view. Temperature-dependent PL spectra displayed dual emission peaks in the temperature range from 100 K to 300 K, which is consistent with the PL spectra obtained from one of its sister compounds MAPbBr3.21,22 Peak positions of the two emission peaks at 100 K: 402 nm (peak 1) and 410.5 nm (peak 2) gradually vary with temperature (as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(b)) with strong divergence in the peak positioned at 175 K, which is close to the crystallographic phase transition temperature. The observation of dual emission in PL spectra of MAPbCl3 is consistent with the other organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites (MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3), which might be due to excitonic emission22 or the coexistence of MA-ordered and MA-disordered domains in the sample.21 However, we believe that a more detailed and careful study, which is beyond the scope of the present work, is required to pin down the origin of dual emission in MAPbCl3. Even though the blue shifting behavior of peak-1 is inconsistent with the conventional semiconducting materials like Si, GaAs etc.,23 this feature in hybrid perovskites can be explained by the Varshni model where the temperature coefficient of band gap (dEg/dT) can be expressed as:24 (1)
 Fig. 3  Comparative optical properties of MAPbCl3 single crystal: (a) room temperature optical absorption spectra; (b) temperature-dependent photoluminescent spectra and inset shows the variation of peak positions with temperature; (c) temperature-dependent data of integrated intensity in cubic phase; (d) schematic energy level diagram; (e) time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectra. 
Here, the first term [(dEg/dT)v] indicates electron–phonon coupling, which represents a decrease in band gap with an increase in temperature, and the second term is the lattice dilation term, which causes the increase in band gap as temperature increases. It is suggested that the blue shifting nature of PL peak in hybrid perovskites arises because of valence band maxima stabilization due to lattice dilation with an increase in temperature.21
Further, exciton binding energy can also be extracted from the temperature dependence of integrated PL intensities. For MAPbCl3, cubic phase is stable above 177.2 K; hence, exciton binding energy was estimated in this phase. Temperature dependence of the integrated intensity of peak 1 in cubic phase is plotted in Fig. 3(c) and fitted using the following formula:19 (2)
Here, I0, EB and KB are zero temperature intensity, exciton binding energy and Boltzmann constant, respectively. Fitting yields the exciton binding energy value to be 105.21 meV, which is consistent with the theoretical estimation of 106 meV.25 Schematic energy level diagram (Fig. 3(d)) of Fermi energy (EF), bottom of conduction band (CB) and top of valence band (VB) were constructed using room temperature PL studies (band gap of 3.11 eV) and linear interpolation of VB spectra, as shown in Fig. 2(d). A proper understanding of this energy level diagram is essential for the efficient fabrication of a visible-blind UV detector and solar cell device.
Excited-state lifetime and recombination dynamics (peak-1) of MAPbCl3 were investigated by the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method by using a pulsed laser of 375 nm excitation (Fig. 3(e)). The obtained TCSPC spectra could be fitted using biexponential fit with two different decay times of 12.4 ns and 160.9 ns suggesting fast and slow carrier recombination times, respectively, which could be assigned to surface and bulk recombination.14 These carrier lifetimes are useful in extracting diffusion lengths of the charge carriers in the sample as explained below.
IV. Transport measurement
For estimating the potential of MAPbCl3 sample in optoelectronic applications, charge transport experiment was also carried out on the same system. Hole mobility was extracted from dark current density–voltage characteristics (J–V) following the standard space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model, in which 400 μm-thick MAPbCl3 single crystal was sandwiched between two 80 nm-thick Au electrodes. Here, J–V curve showed Mott–Gurney's power law dependence as shown in Fig. 4. For lower bias voltages (<0.16 V), MAPbCl3 showed ohmic behavior (I ∝ V) with electrical conductivity (σ) of 7.11 × 10−9 Ω−1 m−1, whereas for bias voltages between 0.16 V and 4.5 V, a sharp rise in current (I ∝ Vn>3) was observed, which can be identified as the trap filling process. The voltage at which all the traps are filled by the charge carriers26 (trap filled limited voltage, VTFL) can be determined using the trap density relation:14,26 (3)where, ε (23.9)12,14 and ε0 are dielectric constants of MAPbCl3 and vacuum, respectively, e is the elementary charge and L (400 μm) is the thickness of the crystal. Using VTFL = 0.16 V, trap density (nt) was estimated to be 2.645 × 109 cm−3. This value of trap density is one order of magnitude lower than that obtained from single crystal grown by the inverse temperature crystallization method14 and seven orders of magnitude lower than that of its thin-film counterpart.27
 Fig. 4  Current–voltage (I–V) response of MAPbCl3 single crystal exhibiting three different regions obtained from the logI versus logV plot. Regions correspond to linear ohmic regime (I ∝ V, red line), trap filling limit regime (I ∝ Vn>3, blue line) and child's regime (I ∝ V2, green line). 
For the voltage region above 4.5 V, i.e. in the trap free space charge limit region (child region), dark current has a quadratic dependence on voltage and can be expressed as (4)where, JD, Vb and μ are current density, applied voltage and hole mobility, respectively. Using eqn (4), hole mobility (μ) and free charge carrier density (nc = σ/eμ) were found to be 14.7 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 3.02 × 107 cm−3, respectively. By combining the values of μ obtained from the SCLC model and carrier lifetime (Tr) from the TCSPC method, carrier diffusion length (LD) can be determined by the following equation: (5)
Two values of diffusion lengths were obtained: (a) 2.47 μm using longer recombination time (160.9 ns) and (b) 0.68 μm for small recombination time (12.4 ns), which can be ascribed to bulk and surface recombination of MAPbCl3 crystals, respectively. Though these extracted values of diffusion lengths are comparable with that of a single crystal of MAPbCl3 grown by the ITC method,14 samples grown by the solvent evaporation method (at room temperature) result in lower values of trap charge density, suggesting that the new method of sample synthesis proposed in this study results in relatively defect-free samples.
Conclusion
In summary, we have presented a completely new route to synthesize high-quality MAPbCl3 crystals through proper selection of the DMSO–GBL solution, which allowed crystallization due to solvent evaporation at room temperature. A detailed evaluation of the structural, electronic, optical and electrical properties of the single crystal was carried out and various parameters like crystallographic phase transition temperatures, band structure and exciton binding energy and transport parameters, such as electrical conductivity, carrier mobility, trap density and diffusion length were determined. Low defect concentration (as seen from optical and charge transport points of view) and longer diffusion length indicate that these hybrid perovskite crystals are promising candidates to work as active components in visible-blind UV detectors. We hope this room temperature growth mechanism will provide a breakthrough for the deployment of MAPbCl3 crystals in practical applications.
