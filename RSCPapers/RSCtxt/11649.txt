    , Accepted 12th April 2021First published on 13th April 2021AbstractRational sorbent technology for crude oil cleanup requires the capability of rapid uptake and a low-cost and simple processing method for large-scale manufacturing. Herein, an elastic carbon sorbent can be fabricated through the direct pyrolysis of a melamine foam at 1000 °C for 2 h. The carbonized melamine foam (CMF) is light weight (density: 5.4 mg cm−3; porosity > 97.2%), superhydrophobic (water contact angle: 151 ± 2°), mechanically robust (complete recovery after 80% strain deformation) and highly efficient in crude oil uptake (148.7 g g−1 crude oil at 60 °C). More importantly, the CMF has excellent photo- and Joule-thermal conversion efficiency for significantly reducing the viscosity of heavy crude oil under mild sunlight exposure or a relatively low voltage. These advantages enable CMFs to provide a fast cleanup approach for accidental oil spills under all weather conditions. Continuous oil recovery has also been demonstrated by using a piece of heated CMF and a vacuum pump. Overall, the CMF offers an ideal material solution for addressing large-scale crude oil cleanup through its versatile and efficient cleanup approaches.
1. Introduction
The exploration, drilling and transportation of crude oil for addressing its strong global demand for energy production has inevitably resulted in significant pollution of the environment from accidental spills and casual discharges,1–3 not only causing catastrophic damage to marine safety and ecological balance but also requiring over billions of dollars for the cleanup. Key requirements for an ideal crude oil recovery solution are (1) rapid and efficient cleanup for minimizing its widespread; (2) excellent oil–water separation efficiency; (3) low cost and easy to mobilize in large areas; (4) no secondary contamination of the environment/marine lives during the process.4–7 Unfortunately, conventional crude oil cleanup technologies, including using chemical dispersants,8in situ combustion,9 and skimming and vacuuming,10 cannot meet all of the above requirements. Therefore, it is essential to develop a new and effective method for addressing the current technology gap in the restoration of oil spills.
Over the past decade, various studies have shown the great promise of superhydrophobic/oleophilic porous sorbents (such as sponges, aerogels and membranes) for efficient oil–water separation.11–16 However, most of these reports are focused on organic solvents and oils with low viscosity, and their applications in crude oil recovery are much less explored. The challenge primarily arises from the inability of crude oil to flow/diffuse into sorbents due to its extremely high viscosity,17 hindering the practical use of these sorbent materials for solving crude oil spill accidents. The most effective approach for reducing the viscosity of crude oil is by increasing its temperature, which has been leveraged by many groups through the development of photothermal composite sponges.18–22 In these studies, one or multiple additives, such as graphene oxides,23,24 carbon nanotubes,25,26 polypyrrole,27 polydopamine and copper sulfide nanoparticles,18,19,28 were incorporated into the sorbent for functionalization. Upon irradiation, the solar energy can be captured and then converted to heat for warming the sorbent in order to lower the surrounding crude oil viscosity for absorption. It is found that photothermal sponges enable a fast and efficient crude oil cleanup under solar irradiation.19 Similarly, electricity has also been employed for producing thermal energy in the sorbent through Joule heating in order to address the circumstances when solar power is weak or inaccessible.29–31 While combining solar heating and Joule heating in sorbent design provides a solution for crude oil cleanup under all weather conditions, these materials often require multiple steps of synthesis/process or involve relatively high costs.31 From a practical application perspective, the material fabrication process ideally should be cheap, highly scalable and reproducible.
In this work, we directly pyrolyzed a commercial melamine foam (MF) for producing a lightweight, elastic, and carbon-based sorbent with a superhydrophobic scaffold, a high porosity (>97.2%) and excellent elasticity. While previous studies have reported the ability of carbonized MFs for oil/water separation,32–36 we demonstrate for the first time that a CMF can be rapidly heated through solar irradiation or electricity for the efficient cleanup of highly viscous crude oil. These CMFs show high efficiency in converting electric energy/solar energy into thermal energy, which cannot be achieved by other polymeric sorbents. Specifically, the CMF temperature can reach up to 96.1 °C under 1.0 sunlight irradiation and 198.8 °C under 8 V voltage, a sufficiently high temperature for decreasing the surrounding crude oil viscosity for an efficient and fast uptake. Compared to other advanced sorbents for crude oil recovery, our method is extremely simple as it only involves a carbonization step. The application of the CMF for the in situ recovery of crude oil using a pump with the assistance of Joule heating and/or solar heating is also demonstrated.
2. Results and discussion
Direct pyrolysis of a MF under N2 provides a simple, low-cost approach to produce functional carbon foams on a very large scale.32,34,37 After carbonization at 1000 °C for 2 h, the foam shows a significantly reduced size from 70 mm × 35 mm × 20 mm to 31 mm × 16 mm × 8 mm, as demonstrated in Fig. 1(a). This high degree of volumetric shrinkage is attributed to the low carbon yield of the MF precursor, consistent with many previous studies.34,37,38 We want to first note that this carbonization condition (1000 °C) is selected based upon the optimization between electrical conductivity and volumetric shrinkage of CMFs, which will be discussed in the following section. The product after carbonization, CMF, is ultra-light weight with a low density of 5.4 mg cm−3 (Fig. 1(b)) and a high porosity of 97.2%, which is very close to the porosity of the MF (95.4%). This result indicates that the high porosity of the MF is able to be preserved upon high temperature carbonization. We further quantified the pore size distribution of the CMF using a high-performance automatic mercury porosimeter and a sharp peak corresponding to a pore size of 71.9 μm is observed, shrunk from a pore size of 158.5 μm (MF) (Fig. 1(c)). The high mechanical integrity of the foam framework also leads to the successful preservation of the three-dimensional network structure during the carbonization process, while the strut thickness decreases substantially from 8.35 ± 0.7 μm (Fig. 1(d and e)) to 2.86 ± 0.3 μm (Fig. 1(g and h)). Moreover, the surface of the CMF becomes rougher than that of the MF as shown in Fig. 1(h) and S1,† which might be due to the synergistic effects of the framework shrinkage and partial decomposition of the MF during the pyrolysis. Fig. 1(i) shows that the surface of the CMF is very hydrophobic with a high water contact angle of 151 ± 2°, an important characteristic for enabling its application in oil absorption.

(b) A photo of the CMF (∼20 mg, ρ = 5.4 mg cm−3) placed on the top of a leaf for demonstrating its ultra-light weight. (c) Pore size distribution of the MF and CMF. The SEM images of the MF and CMF are shown in (d and e) and (g and h), respectively. (f and i) Water contact angles of the MF and CMF, indicating that the foam surface changes from hydrophilic to hydrophobic after carbonization. 
XPS experiments were performed to investigate the changes in the chemical composition of the MF after carbonization. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and Table S1,† the peaks of N (400.3 eV) and O (532.3 eV) have significantly decreased from 10.4 at% and 22.0 at% (MF) to 2.8 at% and 12.1 at% (CMF). Melamine groups are common precursors for nitrogen doping,39–44 but this low N content in our CMF does not alter the hydrophobic nature of the carbon framework.45 The high resolution C 1s spectrum (Fig. 2(b)) can be deconvoluted into four peaks, with 73.7 at% C–C/CC at 284.5 eV, 7.1 at% CN at 285.7 eV, 5.7 at% C–O at 286.3 eV, and 4.5 at% CO/O–CO at 288.3 eV, respectively. In the N 1s spectrum in Fig. 2(c), the binding energies of 397.9 eV, 398.9 eV, 400.9 eV and 404.8 eV correspond to pyridinic N (7.6 at%), pyrrolic N (6.4 at%), graphitic N (64.1 at%) and oxidized pyridinic N (21.9 at%). This relatively high content of graphitic N in the CMF could be useful for improving the conductivity.46,47 Two peaks are observed in the Raman spectrum (Fig. 2(d)) at 1369 cm−1 (D band) and 1597 cm−1 (G band) with an intensity ratio (ID/IG) of 1.03, which are associated with disordered/defective carbons (D band) and graphitic carbons (G band), respectively.28,48,49

The CMF exhibits excellent elasticity and can be fully recovered to its original state without any visible damage or fracture after being deformed by various means, including bending, twisting, curling, stretching and compression by a 200 g weight, which are all shown in Fig. 3 (a–h) and Video S1.† In order to further investigate the mechanical properties of the CMF, the stress–strain curves were obtained under compression mode with a maximum strain of 60% (Fig. 3(i) and S2(a)†) and 80% (Fig. 3(j) and S2(b)†). In both experiments, a large initial linear region (up to 40%), corresponding to the framework’s elastic behaviour, was observed prior to a rapid increase of stress resulting from foam densification. Upon unloading, the strain is able to return back to 0%, indicating a complete volumetric recovery with no plastic deformation. The elastic nature of the CMF can also be confirmed by the very small hysteresis loops between loading and unloading (often associated with strut fracture) as well as the nearly identical stress–strain curves after 10 cycles (similar to the MF, Fig. S3†). The strong mechanical durability of the CMF is not only important for its recycling use, but also may provide additional advantage of its ease in storage and transportation.

The superhydrophobic scaffold surface and high porosity (>97%) of the CMF make it ideal for absorbing organic solvents and oils. As shown in Fig. S4,† the CMF is able to absorb nearly 103.3 g g−1n-hexane and 221.7 g g−1 chloroform, which are higher than those for most absorbents that may require multiple processing steps.50–55 We demonstrated that the CMF can rapidly uptake both n-hexane and chloroform from an aqueous solution (Fig. S5(a and b)†) and effectively in situ separate the oil and water mixture (Fig. S5(c and d)†). After absorption, the solvent can be recovered by simply squeezing the CMF (Fig. S6(a)†). Alternatively, combustion can be used for the regeneration of the spent CMF sorbent.56 As shown in Fig. S6(b) and Video S2,† the CMF is non-flammable and no visible damage of the foam framework can be found due to its excellent elasticity. While a variety of reports have utilized directly carbonized polymer foams as sorbents for efficient oil/water separation,34,57,58 their application in viscous crude oil remediation/cleanup has very rarely been demonstrated.33 Compared to common organic solvents, absorbing crude oil is significantly more challenging due to its very high viscosity at room temperature (>32000 mPa s), resulting in the inability of crude oil droplets to even wet the CMF surface. Fig. 4(a) shows that the viscosity of crude oil can be decreased by more than three orders of magnitude when the temperature increases to 50 °C (Fig. S7†). The enhanced fluidity facilitates the diffusion of crude oil into the sorbent at an elevated temperature. Consequently, the CMF shows a very high crude oil absorption capacity of 120 g g−1 at 40 °C, 145 g g−1 at 50 °C and 148.7 g g−1 when the temperature is 60 °C (Fig. 4(b)), compared to other reports (Table S2†). Furthermore, even after 20 cycles, the CMF can still absorb approximately 135.4 g g−1 crude oil at 50 °C, corresponding to a less than 0.44% decay per cycle (Fig. 4(c)). These results indicate the robustness of the CMF for recycling and its potential to effectively clean up the warm crude oil with a reduced viscosity.

In order to rationalize the efficient crude oil recovery by increasing the oil temperature, the sorbent should possess the ability to produce heat via a simple energy conversion mechanism. Fig. 5(a) shows the UV-vis-NIR spectra of the MF and CMF, in which a significant increase in the absorbance was observed over a broad range of wavelengths from 300 nm to 2500 nm after carbonization. This result is consistent with much higher molar absorption coefficients of carbons than those of polymers.59 The heating behavior of the CMF under different sunlight intensities was quantitatively studied by monitoring its temperature change as a function of exposure time (Fig. 5(b)). Under all irradiation conditions, the CMF can rapidly achieve an equilibrium temperature within 20 s. In these simulated experiments, the temperature of the CMF surface increased from 57.4 °C at 0.5 sun (Fig. S8†) to 96.1 °C at 1.0 sun, 123.0 °C at 1.5 sun and 144.0 °C at 2.0 sun. Upon the removal of sunlight exposure, the foam was quickly cooled down to room temperature within 10 s, indicating a completely photo-controlled heating process. Remarkably, the CMF was able to reach approximately 70 °C in a real environment when the outside temperature was just around 10 °C (Fig. 5(c)), showing its great potential for crude oil remediation even under relatively cold weather conditions.

The light was turned off after 180 s. (c) Infrared thermal imaging of the CMF under simulated sunlight irradiation with different intensities. The highest surface temperature is included in each figure. Note: the real sun measurement was performed on December 25, 2020, at 10:20 a.m. in Shanghai, China, when the environmental temperature was around 10 °C. 
A constant sunlight irradiation support is almost impossible in practice, and therefore an alternative approach for producing heat from the CMF is essential when sunlight is weak or inaccessible in order to provide a sustainable solution for immediately addressing crude oil spill accidents. Here, we show that our CMF can produce efficient Joule heating under different voltages. As demonstrated in Fig. 6(a), the temperature of the CMF rapidly increases when a voltage is applied, and it exceeds 100 °C even at a relatively low voltage (6 V). Upon further increasing the voltage to 8 V, the CMF is able to reach a very high temperature (198.8 °C). As comparison, a relatively recent study showed that a graphene-wrapped sponge requires 35 V for achieving a similarly high temperature (200 °C),60 indicating that our materials may provide a more energy-saving approach through Joule heating. Moreover, when the carbonization temperature is 800 °C, the resistance of the CMF (0.7 cm × 3.5 cm × 2 cm) is high (≥1000 Ω), so its Joule heating performance is limited. Thus, a carbonization temperature of 1000 °C is an optimized condition for achieving both excellent electrothermal performance and oil uptake capacity. When the power was turned off, the temperature quickly decreased to room temperature. The infrared imaging photos in Fig. 6(b) confirm the uniform Joule-heating in the CMF. For carbonized materials, heating them at higher temperatures will lead to a lower resistance. Therefore, the temperature increase of the CMF also leads to a slight decrease in its electrical resistance (Fig. 6(c)), which could further allow enhanced heat production according to Joule's law.30,61Fig. 6(d) shows that the high conductivity of the CMF enables the illumination of an LED light when connected in an electric circuit. Furthermore, the CMF remains hydrophobic even under 8 V voltage, with a water contact angle of 150 ± 2° as shown in Fig. 6(e and f). Furthermore, Fig. S9† shows that the CMF can be heated with simultaneous photo-thermal and Joule-thermal, and this coupling effect is expected to lead to a further enhancement in the oil absorption efficiency. Compared to other reported sorbent materials, our CMF not only enables a versatile and efficient heating through solar irradiation or electricity, but also it is significantly cheaper than any other reported materials for potential large-scale production, as shown in Fig. S10.†

(d) An LED lamp can be turned on when a piece of CMF was connected with a circuit and the supplied voltage was 3 V. (e) The picture of water droplets on the top of the CMF when the applied voltage is 8 V, and the inset photo shows the water contact angle of the CMF at 8 V (150 ± 2°). The corresponding thermal imaging photo is shown in (f). The size of the sponge in this experiment is 2.5 cm × 1.6 cm × 0.8 cm. 
As previously discussed, heating is an effective method for enabling the CMF to absorb crude oil, which we show that it can be achieved with the assistance of solar energy or electricity. Fig. 7 shows that a large crude oil droplet of approximately 0.4 mL on the top of the CMF can be completely absorbed within 140 s under a sunlight simulator (intensity: 1.0 sunlight) or within 50 s with an applied voltage of 8 V. When the solar irradiation and electricity were applied together, the absorption of crude oil was accelerated. The crude oil was fully absorbed by the CMF within 20 s, faster than the case of solar irradiation or using electrical potential solely. The enhanced kinetics is attributed to the higher temperature of sorbents, and a systematic study is shown in Fig. S11.† These results confirm the versatile capability of the CMF to produce heat energy for lowering the viscosity of crude oil, thus leading to an efficient uptake for the cleanup.

Finally, we demonstrate the implementation of the CMF for crude oil cleanup in a simulated oil spill accident, an important step toward practical application. As shown in Fig. S12,† two different approaches are employed, both of which are highly efficient. For solar heating shown in Fig. S12(a),† a piece of CMF (3.1 cm × 1.6 cm × 0.5 cm) was first irradiated using a sunlight simulator (intensity: 1.0 sunlight) in order to warm up the surrounding crude oil for decreasing the viscosity. After 16 min of irradiation, the heated crude oil can be continuously adsorbed into the CMF, and the excellent recycling performance enables a complete recovery of 40 mL crude oil through multiple absorption–desorption cycles. Alternatively, Joule heating can be used when sunlight exposure is insufficient or difficult to access. Under such circumstances, electricity is employed to heat a piece of CMF (on the top of crude oil) that is connected with the inlet pipe of a peristaltic pump. In Fig. S12(b),† when a voltage of 8 V is applied, the heating of the CMF significantly improves the fluidity of crude oil to be continuously sucked into a collecting beaker using a peristaltic pump. In Fig. 8(b–d) and Video S3,† a photo-thermal and Joule-thermal coupling experiment was carried out to confirm the capability of the CMF to provide versatile and efficient crude oil cleanup under all weather conditions. As shown in Fig. 8(e–g) and Video S4,† the crude oil was rapidly heated by the high temperature CMF and continuously recovered by the peristaltic pump, 17.4 g crude oil was recovered within 80 s. This shows that under the synergistic action of photo- and electro-induced heating, the fluidity of crude oil increases significantly with the increase of temperature, and the diffusion rate of crude oil in the sponge is accelerated, which is finally manifested in the accelerated rate of crude oil recovery. Considering its advantages of low cost, ease of large-scale production (one-step carbonization), high durability, and excellent crude oil uptake/recycling performance, the CMF represents one of the most promising solutions for addressing large-scale crude oil spills in practical applications.

3. Experimental
3.1 Materials
The melamine foam (MF) used in this study was purchased from Taobao (density: 8 kg m−3, porosity > 99%) and crude oil was supplied by Haldor Topsoe Company in Jiangsu, China. Oil red O (biological stain) and dodecane (>99%) were obtained from Adamas Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). All other chemicals, including n-hexane (>97%), toluene (>99%), chloroform (>99.8%) and dichloromethane (>99.5%), were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd Artificial seawater was prepared by combining sodium chloride (24.72 g), magnesium chloride hexahydrate (4.66 g), potassium chloride (0.67 g), calcium chloride (1.0 g), magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (6.285 g) and sodium bicarbonate (0.18 g) in deionized water (1 L), followed by stirring at room temperature for 1 h in order to allow full dissolution. All chemicals were used as received, unless otherwise specified.
3.2 Preparation of the carbonized melamine foam (CMF)
The MF was directly pyrolyzed in a quartz tube using an electric furnace (GSL 1600X, Hefei Kejing Material Technology Co., Ltd) under a nitrogen atmosphere (N2, purity > 99.99%, flow rate: 30 mL min−1) (note: the quartz tube inside the furnace was flushed with N2 gas for 60 min prior to the pyrolysis process). The furnace was first heated to 500 °C at a heating ramp of 2 °C min−1, after which the temperature was increased to 1000 °C (heating ramp: 5 °C min−1). The sample was held at 1000 °C for 2 h before cooling down to room temperature. The CMF can be directly used as sorbents for crude oil recovery, without any further functionalization/modification process.
3.3 Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Sigma 300) was used to investigate the morphologies of the MF and CMF. In order to enhance the imaging contrast for SEM characterization, thin slices of foam samples were spray coated with gold. The chemical composition of samples was examined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Thermo Scientific™ K-Alpha™+ spectrometer) with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s and N 1s were quantitatively analyzed/deconvoluted by fitting with multiple Gaussian–Lorentz peaks after a Shirley background subtraction. UV-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectra of the MF and CMF sponges were characterized using a spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-4100) with the wavelength ranging from 300 nm to 2500 nm. The water contact angle (WCA) of the foam surface was determined using a Data Physics instrument (OCA 20, Filderstadt, Germany) using a 10 μL water droplet. A viscometer (Brookfield, DV1 viscometer, USA) was used to study the viscosity of crude oil at different temperatures. Porosity and pore size distribution of the CMF were determined using a mercury porosimeter (AutoPore V 9620, Micromeritics Instrument Corporation). The mechanical properties (and compressibility) of the CMF were characterized using an electronic universal testing machine (CMT6103, Meters Industrial Systems (China) Co., Ltd) with a 100 N detection cell and a deformation speed of 5 mm min−1. The Raman spectrum of the CMF was obtained using a Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm laser as the excitation source (HORIBA XploRA Plus, Japan).
A xenon arc lamp (Perfectlight PLS-SXE300, 300 W) was employed as a simulated solar source for irradiating the CMF. For each experiment involving photothermal conversion, the illumination intensity of simulated sunlight was first measured using a power meter (Beijing Normal University Optoelectronic Instrument Factory, Model: FZ-A) and then converted to an optical power density (AM1.5 standard spectrum was used as a reference). For investigating the Joule heating property, the CMF was connected to a DC power supply (MS-305D, MAISHENG). A thermal couple (Fluke thermometer) was inserted into the center of the CMF for measuring its temperature under different voltages or solar irradiation, and the temperature change was recorded every 5 s. The electrical resistance of the CMF was measured by using an electrochemical workstation (Bio-Logic VMP3), in which the copper sheets (0.065 mm thickness) were attached to both foam ends using conductive silver glue (HUMISEAI, America). All infrared thermal images in this study were recorded using a FLIR ONE PRO camera.
3.4 CMF for oil absorption and separation
The absorption capacities (Q) of the CMF for various organic solvents and oils were determined using the following equation: (1)where m0 and mt are the CMF mass before and after complete saturation with oil/solvent. The mt was immediately measured after removing the CMF from the solvent. Desorption of solvents from the CMF was performed by either the squeezing or combustion method. For the oil–water separation experiment, a mixture of 5 mL organic solvent and 5 mL deionized water was directly added into a funnel containing a piece of CMF, and a beaker was used to recover/collect the organic solvents after in situ separation. In the crude oil adsorption experiment, the warm CMF was washed with ethanol immediately after each cycle for a complete desorption of crude oil.
An accidental crude oil spill was simulated by dropping highly viscous crude oil (40 mL) on artificial seawater (90 mL). Two different approaches were demonstrated for efficient crude oil cleanup through either solar heating or Joule heating. For solar heating, the CMF (3.1 cm × 1.6 cm × 0.5 cm) was first placed on the crude oil surface, which was then exposed to 1.0 sunlight irradiation using a sunlight simulator as previously described. During this process, the CMF was self-heated via photothermal conversion and 40 mL of crude oil from the spill can be completely recovered by multiple absorption–desorption cycles; alternatively, in situ crude oil recovery via Joule heating was performed through the following procedure: the inlet tubing of a peristaltic pump (Kamoer) was connected with a piece of CMF (3.1 cm × 1.6 cm × 0.8 cm), both ends of which were attached to copper sheets. Subsequently, a voltage of 8 V was applied to the CMF sponge for inducing Joule heating. After the temperature of the CMF reaches equilibrium, the peristaltic pump was turned on for continuously separating the crude oil from the simulated spill. The Joule heating and solar heating coupling experiment was similar to the Joule heating process, while the sunlight intensity was 1.0 sunlight and the applied voltage was 8 V. In order to improve the recyclability of the CMF sponge, the CMF sponge was immediately squeezed after use, since the crude oil at a higher temperature is easier to remove from the CMF sponge. The desorption process can be performed by repeatedly squeezing and rinsing with ethanol.
4. Conclusions
Direct carbonization of a commercial melamine foam yields an elastic carbonized melamine foam (CMF) for efficiently addressing crude oil spill accidents. The CMF is superhydrophobic and exhibits an excellent elasticity even after a large degree of deformation. Beyond conventional oil–water separation using model organic solvents, we demonstrated the ability of the CMF to uptake highly viscous crude oil through two different mechanisms, including solar heating and Joule heating. The temperature of the CMF is able to rapidly reach 96.1 °C under solar irradiation (1.0 sun intensity), and applying 8 V voltage to the CMF results in a high temperature of 198.8 °C. The produced heat can effectively lower the viscosity of the surrounding crude oil in order to promote its diffusion into the CMF. We show the successful recovery/cleanup of crude oil from a simulated spill accident by either multiple sorption cycles or continuous pumping. Combined capabilities of solar heating and Joule heating of the CMF can overcome the previous challenges associated with the limits from weather conditions and/or energy cost. Finally, the simple, low-cost and scalable preparation method for the CMF further provides advantages for addressing large-scale viscous crude oil spills in a highly efficient manner.
