    , Accepted 2nd July 2021First published on 2nd July 2021AbstractThe thermal field effect effectively boosts water splitting electrocatalysis by lowering activation energy barriers and accelerating sluggish kinetics. Solar-powered light-to-heat conversion of photothermal materials enabling desirable surface heat localization satisfies the integration of in situ heating to supply an additional energy source to promote electrocatalytic reactions. Based on these concepts, we herein report a robust photothermal–electrocatalytic water splitting system based on broadband solar harvesting nickel phosphide (Ni2P) within a heat-insulating quasi-Ni-BDC-MOF. Benefiting from the controllable thermal treatment for partial deligandation and synchronous phosphorization, the highly dispersed ultrafine Ni2P nanoparticles are spatially confined within quasi-Ni-BDC-MOF nanosheets, ensuring the effective utilization of local heat assisted by heat-insulating quasi-Ni-BDC-MOF to suppress heat loss.

By coupling with this excellent photothermal performance, Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC under full spectrum light illumination demonstrates the ultralow overpotentials of 246 and 218 mV to deliver 100 mA cm−2 current density for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions and shows negligible degradation over operating for 50 h and excellent recyclability under several repeated on–off cycles. This performance compares favorably with those of previously reported electrocatalysts working at large currents and outperforms those of most of the photothermal electrocatalysts for water splitting.
Introduction
Electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production has been considered as one of the most promising approaches to mitigate the energy crisis and associated environmental issues1–3 and basically comprises two half reactions including the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nevertheless, their intrinsically sluggish kinetics seriously cause undesirable large overpotentials, hence becoming the bottleneck to restrict its application in energy-saving and cost-effective manners.4,5 To this end, tremendous efforts have been focused on the rational design and construction of robust earth-abundant transition metal catalysts to replace the currently used expensive precious metal catalysts (such as Pt, Ru and Ir).6,7 Due to the composition and structure similarity to natural hydrogenase, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as promising nonprecious metal electrocatalysts displaying distinguished OER and HER performances.8,9 To date, the universal metal–organic framework (MOF) templates have been widely utilized for the guided synthesis of TMPs with various structures and diverse compositions,10,11 so as to comprehensively optimize the electrocatalytic performances. However, the obtained TMPs usually require a direct high-temperature calcination treatment, unavoidably causing the complete decomposition and structural collapse of MOFs, which results in the blockage and agglomeration of the metal active centers. Undoubtedly, it is highly demanded to develop an effective method for the rational synthesis of highly dispersed TMPs onto a MOF, thus simultaneously bearing their structural and compositional merits and building favorable synergy between them during water splitting processes. Notably, the transition MOF material, namely quasi-MOF, proposed by Xu's group can be obtained by a controlled deligandation process,12 which inherits the structural skeleton of the pristine MOF and is a new platform for the design of TMP-based electrocatalysts.13,14
Recently, various external field effects have been implemented in electrocatalysis,15–18 which is proven to be a promising methodology to promote electrocatalytic performances. Among them, a temperature-related thermal field is well controllable and easily established. The combination of a thermal field with water splitting electrocatalysis enables the lowering of the activation energy barriers, greatly speeding up the reaction kinetics. More importantly, photothermal electrocatalysts with the ability of light-to-heat conversion provide an in situ local heating method from renewable solar energy to introduce smart temperature flexibility and necessary additional energy supply to the electrocatalytic system, which is superior to the traditional direct heating method and thus received attractive interest. For example, Zhang's group found that nickel/reduced graphene oxide nanosheets and Co/CoO heterostructured nanosheets under full spectrum light irradiation would generate a photothermal effect to promote electrocatalytic water splitting.19,20 A similar phenomenon was disclosed by Ho's group in a carbonaceous/metallic hybrid array structure (CM/TiO2−x/CP) under full spectrum light irradiation, simultaneously satisfying efficient photothermal conversion and electrocatalytic activity.21 In addition to simulated solar light sources, near infrared (NIR) light has also been used as a photothermal energy source to promote the temperature elevation and performance improvement of cobalt-based electrocatalytic systems22 and spinel NiFe2O4.23 Despite these impressive advances, it remains a great challenge for the full optimization of thermal management to achieve robust photothermal–electrocatalytic water splitting.
Herein, we report for the first time the thermal management of broadband solar harvesting nickel phosphide (Ni2P) within a heat-insulating porous quasi-Ni-BDC metal–organic framework (MOF) to simultaneously improve light absorbance and suppress heat loss, in terms of the significantly lower thermal conductivity of the BDC-based MOF compared to that of metal phosphide.24,25 A controllable partial deligandation and synchronous phosphorization strategy is developed to in situ anchor the nickel phosphide nanoparticles highly dispersed on the quasi-Ni-BDC nanosheets. Under simulated solar light illumination, the black Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF exhibits an ultrasensitive and stable light-to-heat response. Taking advantage of this excellent photothermal performance, a highly efficient photothermal–electrocatalytic water splitting system based on Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF is rationally constructed and shows outstanding activities and good stabilities towards OER and HER electrocatalysis under full spectrum light illumination, with the ultralow overpotentials of 246 and 218 mV to deliver 100 mA cm−2 current density, respectively. This performance is superior to that obtained under dark conditions and outperforms that of most of the water splitting electrocatalysts working at large currents, thus demonstrating a feasible and efficient photothermal strategy to enhance the electrocatalytic performance using renewable solar energy.
Experimental
Synthesis of black Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC nanosheet arrays on Ni foam
The black Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC nanosheet arrays on Ni foam (NF) were fabricated by using a nickel-based MOF as a precursor and template. The Ni foam (3 cm × 3 cm) was firstly cleaned in ethanol, 1 M HCl, and deionized water for 10 min by ultrasonication, respectively, and was then calcined at 500 °C for 2 h in air to achieve surface oxidized NF for the further growth of the MOF.26,27 In a typical procedure, 5 mmol of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (1,4-BDC) was ultrasonically dispersed in 15 mL of N,N-dimethylmethanamide, which was mixed with 15 mL water solution containing 5 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O in a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave with pre-treated Ni foam. After heating at 180 °C for 24 h, the bright green Ni-BDC MOF on Ni foam was obtained. For the synthesis of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC, Ni-BDC/NF was placed in ceramic boats with 1 g of NaH2PO2 in the upstream zone of a tube furnace. Phosphorization treatment was conducted at 350 °C for 2 h at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 under a flow of nitrogen gas.
Characterization
The crystal structures of the obtained products were determined on a high-resolution X-ray diffractometer (XRD, SmartLab 9 K, Rigaku) using Cu Kα radiation. The morphologies and microstructures were observed by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss Gemini 500) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). The optical reflectance and transmittance spectra ranging from 200 to 2500 nm were recorded on a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) equipped with an integrating sphere. Absorption efficiency (A) was calculated according to the equation: A = 1 − T − R, where T and R are the transmittance and reflectance efficiency, respectively. The chemical compositions and elemental valence of products were analyzed by using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was conducted on a Nicolet-6700 spectrometer. The infrared thermal photographs were captured by using an infrared camera (Fluke PTI120). The temperatures were recorded in real time using an ATEST Thermometer (DT-847UD).
Electrochemical measurement
All electrochemical measurements were performed in a photothermally electrochemical system similar to the conventional three-electrode system with an electrochemical instrument (Interface 1010E, Gamry Instruments) using Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC as a photothermally active working electrode, a graphite rod as the counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode as the reference electrode, and 1.0 M KOH as the electrolyte, respectively. During the electrochemical test, the working electrode was irradiated under a 300 W Xenon lamp (ceAuLight CEL-HXF300) with an AM 1.5G filter. The simulated light intensity was 500 mW cm−2 controlled with an optical power meter (CEL-NP2000). To achieve the efficient thermal management of the working electrode region, a piece of melamine foam (MF) with a low intrinsic thermal conductivity was used to separate two half cells.21 All applied potentials were calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale: ERHE = EAgCl/Ag + 0.059 pH + 0.197. The current interrupt (CI) mode available in Gamry software was applied for iR compensation. Chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry were performed under the same conditions without iR drop compensation.
Results and discussion
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been universally utilized as robust precursors to construct various functional derivatives owing to their diverse composition and high surface area. The thermal transformation of a MOF into metal phosphides under a specific atmosphere was easily realized,28,29 but the pristine skeletal structure tended to collapse in the derived materials at higher temperature leading to the isolation of some active metal sites by the outer carbonization layer, thus delaying the close contact with reactants. Recent investigations have demonstrated that a controllable thermal transformation strategy by partial deligandation to obtain quasi-MOF structures effectively overcomes the above drawbacks and inherit the skeleton and porosity.12–14,30–34 Based on these considerations, we herein fabricated a new MOF derivative in which ultrafine nickel phosphide nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed within a structure-reserved quasi-MOF, as shown in Fig. 1a. The typical thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the selected Ni-BDC MOF is displayed in Fig. S1.† Two major stages of weight loss were observed from room temperature to 420 °C and the temperature range of 420–600 °C. The first stage results from gradual mass loss of coordinated solvent molecules and partial deligandation. while the second stage is attributed to the decomposition and further carbonization of the organic ligands. Therefore, the quasi-Ni-BDC MOF is reasonably produced by controlling the thermal treatment temperature below 420 °C. In this regard, we conducted a thermal transformation and synchronous phosphorization strategy for the growth of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC on nickel foam (NF) by controllable calcination of Ni-BDC/NF in a N2 atmosphere at 350 °C in the presence of NaH2PO2 as a phosphorus source. The crystal structure of the synthesized Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As clearly shown in Fig. 1b, the quasi-Ni-BDC shows an almost identical XRD pattern to the as-synthesized original Ni-BDC, and no peaks belonging to Ni-based metallic phases and oxides were observable, suggesting that the pristine MOF skeleton survived via controlled partial deligandation. Interestingly, the phosphorization process induced the formation of Ni2P accompanied by the appearance of characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ of 40.7° (111), 47.3° (210) and 54.1° (300), 54.9 (211), 66.4 (310), 72.6 (311) and 74.6 (400) (Fig. S2, ESI†). The enlarged XRD pattern in the range of 5°–35° also reveals the coexistence of quasi-Ni-BDC in the product. The broadening feature of the peaks around 5°–15° further confirms that the deligandation behavior still occurred under phosphorization conditions.12 The molecular structure information of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC was further revealed by FTIR spectroscopy. The characteristic bands centered at 1381 and 1578 cm−1 of the carboxylate linkers were distinctly observed in all the samples (Fig. 1c). Consistent with the XRD result, the band at 1578 cm−1 for Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC broadened as well, indicating the partial deligandation of Ni-BDC.12 Notably, the broadening behavior of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC is different from that of quasi-Ni-BDC, implying that the phosphorization would accelerate the deligandation process.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed to probe the elemental compositions and surface chemical status of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC. The survey scan (Fig. S3, ESI†) illustrates the presence of Ni, P, O and C elements in Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC. Ni-BDC and quasi-Ni-BDC show similar Ni 2p spectra containing two peaks at 855.8 and 873.5 eV with the corresponding shakeup satellites, which is ascribed to the Ni 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Ni2+ (Fig. 1d). The phosphorization induced the presence of a Ni–P bond (853.1 eV) in Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC, suggesting the partial formation of phosphide. In addition, the peak corresponding to Ni2+ shifts to a higher binding energy, implying a strong interaction between guest Ni2P and inorganic nodes in the quasi-Ni-BDC MOF. The C 1s spectra (Fig. 1e) could be deconvoluted into three carbon species of C–C (284.8 eV), C–O (285.6 eV) and CO (288.3 eV), while the O 1s spectra (Fig. 1f) can be fitted to three components of Ni–O (530.8 eV), C–O (531.8 eV) and CO (533.2 eV), confirming that quasi-Ni-BDC coexisted in Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC. In addition, the P 2p spectrum (Fig. 1g) shows two peaks centered at binding energies of 129.5 eV and 134.4 eV, which are assigned to the characteristic Ni–P species in metal phosphides and surface oxidized phosphorus species, respectively.
The digital photograph (Fig. S4, ESI†) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. S5, ESI†) disclose that the original Ni-BDC was densely grown on the skeleton of Ni foam, which appeared as a sheet-like morphology cross-linked with each other. By controlled thermal phosphorization treatment, Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF retained the opened macroscopical porous structures (Fig. 2a) and oriented sheet-like profile (Fig. 2b). Different from the smooth surface of Ni-BDC sheets, Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC became rather coarse (Fig. 2c). The typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 2d) further verified that Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC was constructed from the rectangular sheets. The enlarged edge region (Fig. 2e) shows that the rectangular sheet matrix was actually embedded with a large number of nanoparticles. Interestingly, these in situ formed phosphide nanoparticles with a uniform size of 5 nm are space-confined and well-monodispersed (Fig. 2f). Meanwhile, the characteristic micropores of quasi-Ni-BDC were clearly observed as well. These results verify the formation of a unique structure of space-confined Ni2P within quasi-Ni-BDC. The HRTEM image (Fig. 2g) reveals that the individual nanoparticles present a crystallized structure with a lattice fringe spacing of 0.22 nm corresponding to the (111) crystal plane of Ni2P. Additionally, the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings (Fig. 2h and i) obviously illustrate the uniform distribution of Ni, P, C, and O elements across the whole surface of the Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC arrays.

The light harvesting ability of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF greatly determines the solar-to-thermal conversion efficiency. The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra were examined to probe the photothermal properties, which are weighted under standard solar irradiance of AM 1.5G. As shown in Fig. 3a, Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF exhibits excellent optical absorption throughout the whole solar spectrum. The total solar absorption reaches as high as 96%, which is superior to that of pre-treated NF. The extraordinary light-harvesting performance would be closely associated with its unique composition and distinctive structure. The Ni2P component with a small band gap enables the high relaxation of excited electrons and holes to the edge of the conduction and valence bands before recombining, converting the irradiation energy into heat.35,36 Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF also holds several attractive anti-reflective characteristics originating from its hierarchically porous structure. The synergy between the macropores of NF and mesopores of the interstitial MOF sheet increases the optical path length and strengthens the light trapping.37,38 To confirm the light-to-thermal behavior, a piece of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF was placed on melamine foam with a low intrinsic thermal conductivity, in which the surface temperature was monitored in real time by using a k-type thermocouple (Fig. 3b) and the corresponding infrared thermal photographs were captured at a fixed time. Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF displays a rapid photothermal response under simulated solar illumination. The surface temperature of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF rapidly rises from 23 °C to 84.8 °C within 10 s and reaches an equilibrium temperature around 133.1 °C within 120 s (Fig. 3c and d). In contrast, when the simulated solar light is off, the surface temperature can quickly drop down. Moreover, Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF can maintain its excellent photothermal stability for three cycles within 200 min (Fig. 3e). These results demonstrate the ultrasensitive and stable photothermal response of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF.

To effectively integrate the outstanding photothermal effect with an electrocatalytic system, a designed photothermal–electrocatalytic test system was constructed. Melamine foam (MF) with low intrinsic thermal conductivity is inserted between two half cells to reduce the heat loss around the electrode and minimize heat diffusion in the electrolyte, in which the porous feature still ensures the required ion transportation. Fig. 4a shows the temperature variation profiles of the two regions (T1: facing the light source; T2: back to the light source) in the photothermal–electrocatalytic test system in the absence of MF. The temperature of the T1 region reaches 39.4 °C, slightly higher than that of the T2 region (36.7 °C), which nearly maintains a constant temperature difference of about 2.7 °C after one hour of solar irradiation. Interestingly, the temperature difference between the two half cells is remarkably enhanced and reaches as high as 13.7 °C by introducing a piece of MF (Fig. 4b), suggesting that the heat interchange is greatly restricted between the two cells. Moreover, the temperature of the electrolyte with Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF is approximately 2 °C higher than that of the blank after 40 min of irradiation (Fig. S6, ESI†), confirming the photothermal contribution of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF. This observation is consistent with the phenomenon reported in photothermal CM/TiO2x/CP21 and Ni–W–B39 systems. The localized thermal effect from Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF can be fully utilized to introduce additional energy to reduce the reaction energy barrier and cooperatively promote electrocatalytic water splitting. Meanwhile, accompanied by the elevated temperature, the charge carrier transport and gas evolution would be accelerated as well. To verify the photothermal effect and track the photothermal temperature-dependent electrocatalytic performance, Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF was first irradiated under simulated solar light to catalyze the OER. Fig. 4c shows the OER polarization curves of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF along with irradiation time in alkaline media with iR compensation (Fig. S7, ESI†). Under dark conditions, Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF displays excellent OER performance, which is superior to that of bare quasi-Ni-BDC/NF (Fig. S8, ESI†) and can produce a current density of 100 mA cm−2 at a potential of 1.57 V vs. RHE, corresponding to a low overpotential of 338 mV. As expected, the greatly improved OER activities of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF are observed upon exposure to light illumination. The onset OER potential coupled with the photothermal effect is reduced to 1.38 V vs. RHE, which is much earlier than that under dark conditions. It is noticeable that the reduction peak of Ni species in the potential windows of 1.10–1.32 V vs. RHE presents a distinctively negative shift upon exposure to light. This phenomenon becomes more pronounced with the prolongation of the light irradiation. It is generally accepted that the redox characteristics of Ni species in Ni-based OER electrocatalysts are critical to the generation of electrochemically active sites. Such an observed behavior implies that the photothermal effect can promote favorably dynamic surface reconstruction to produce more catalytically active sites, consistent with a recent observation on photothermal NiFe2O4, Ni/NiO–NF, and Co-based OER electrocatalysts.22,23,40Fig. 4d highlights the comparative OER activities and photothermal temperature as a function of irradiation time. The overpotentials of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF gradually reduce accompanied by increasing the photothermal temperature under constant light illumination. Specifically, the photothermal overpotential of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF dramatically reduces to 246 mV for delivering a current density of 100 mA cm−2, which is 92 mV lower than that under dark reaction conditions and even superior to that of most of the previously reported Ni-based OER electrocatalysts at high large currents (Fig. 4e), such as Ni2(1−x)Mo2xP (η100 = 346 mV),41 (Ni–Fe)Sx/NiFe(OH)y (η100 = 290 mV),42 NiFe/NiFe–OH (η100 = 261 mV),43 NiCe@NiFe/NF–N (η100 = 254 mV),44 Ni3S2/Co3S4 (η100 = 270 mV),45 KT-Ni(0)@Ni(II)-TPA (η100 = 254 mV),46 Ni–Fe–Se cages (η100 = 262 mV),47 NiFe–NFF (η100 = 262 mV),48 Ni1.5Fe0.5P (η100 = 293 mV),49 Ni2P–Fe2P/NF (η100 = 261 mV),50 and Ni2P/(NiFe)2P(O) (η100 = 290 mV).51 Notably, the OER performance of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF with quite a low overpotential in this study makes it one of the most active photothermal OER electrocatalysts reported in the literature (Fig. 4f).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to investigate the electrode kinetics of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF and elucidate the photothermally enhanced performance upon exposure to light illumination. Fig. 4g shows the comparative EIS curves of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF under dark and light conditions, which are fitted with the equivalent circuit diagram model of R(QR)(QR)(CR). The irradiated Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF exhibits a smaller charge transfer resistance than that under dark conditions, indicating faster interfacial electron transfer during OER electrocatalysis due to the favorable solar-to-heat conversion induced local temperature elevation effect. Moreover, a smaller series resistance is also observed under light conditions, implying that the photothermal heating would be beneficial to the decreased electronic resistance and promotion of electron conductivity of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF.52,53 The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is measured to further evaluate the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF affected by the photothermal effect. The ECSA is generally indicated by the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) derived from cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a non-faradaic region (Fig. S9, ESI†). As illustrated in Fig. 4h, the photothermal heating remarkably promotes the increase in the Cdl value (84.2 mF cm−2) of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF, which is almost 3.3 times as large as that under dark conditions (25.3 mF cm−2). This suggests that highly rich catalytically active sites on the surface of the illuminated Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF are induced by the photothermal effect, which is consistent with above observed redox characteristic of Ni species in the Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF and similar to the observation in a photothermal Ni–W–B electrocatalyst.39 In addition, the temperature elevation would enable accelerated penetration of the electrolyte into the electrode to gain a better contact between catalytically active sites and reactants in the electrolyte and favor mass transport.22
To further understand the photothermal heating promotion effect on OER electrocatalysis, the OER electrocatalytic activities of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF were compared under different conditions, such as only heating at 46 °C (the same temperature as the photothermal temperature but in the absence of light illumination) and 420 nm monochromatic light irradiation (light excitation). As shown in Fig. 5a, in the absence of light illumination, when the temperature is elevated up to 46 °C by external water bath heating, the electrocatalytic OER performance can be still enhanced, as evidenced by the negative shift of the polarization curve. Specifically, Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF by external heating can achieve a large current density of 348 mA cm−2 at a potential of 1.60 V vs. RHE, nearly 3 times as high as that under ambient conditions, uncovering that the heating effect can effectively boost OER electrocatalysis to facilitate the reaction kinetics and improve the gas evolution.20 Considering the narrow semiconductor nature of metal phosphide and possible charge transfer between Ni2P and quasi-MOF under light illumination, the OER electrocatalytic performance of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF is assessed using monochromatic light (420 nm) instead of full spectrum irradiation. To accurately compare the OER performance, the temperature was in situ monitored during the test process. Clearly, the temperature is slightly increased from room temperature to 33.4 °C within one hour of irradiation exposure to 420 nm monochromatic light (Fig. 5b). Meanwhile, the OER performance under monochromatic light irradiation is inferior to that obtained under external heating, indicating the minor role of direct light excitation but a primary heating effect contributing to enhanced performances. Fig. 5c illustrates the quantitative comparison of catalytic current density at an overpotential of 300 mV and the corresponding enhancement factor of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF under various conditions, which suggests that both the heating and light irradiation can improve the OER performance of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF. The most effective enhancement is induced under full spectrum light irradiation due to the synergetic combination of the photothermal effect and light excitation (Fig. 5f), in which the enhancement factor reaches as high as 5.4. Correspondingly, the reaction kinetics of OER electrocatalysis is most favorable under full spectrum light irradiation, which is evidenced by the smallest Tafel slope (Fig. 5d) and charge transfer resistance (Fig. 5e) among all the test conditions.

The stability of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF is another essential factor to comprehensively determine the electrocatalytic OER performance. Fig. 5g shows the chronopotentiometric curves of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF at 50 mA cm−2 in the presence of full spectrum light irradiation. There is no observable change of the real-time potential during continuous long-time operation of 50 h, indicating the excellent durability of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF. Post-OER characterization reveals that the original structure of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF is well maintained under full spectrum light irradiation (Fig. S10, ESI†), but Ni2P experiences surface oxidation during the OER process (Fig. S11, ESI†). The recyclability of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF was evaluated by cyclic experiments. Fig. 5h illustrates the variation of overpotential at a current density of 50 mA cm−2 in different cycles. The overpotential of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF is significantly decreased when illuminated under light, whereas it increases after removing light illumination. This phenomenon is observed for at least four on–off cycles, revealing the good repeatability of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF. Furthermore, OER electrocatalysis over Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF was investigated under periodic light on–off cycles. For comparison, the temperature change was monitored in real time as well. As shown in Fig. 5i, the OER catalytic current and temperature exhibit the same trend under several repeated on–off light irradiation cycles. They simultaneously increased under continuous light irradiation and dropped when the light was turned off. Notably, the rapid increase in catalytic current is ascribed to the photoelectric effect, while the gradual increase of catalytic current is associated with the photothermal effect.54,55 Clearly, the current with gradually increased trend occupies most of the proportion of catalytic current, confirming the main contribution of the photothermal heating effect to OER catalytic current.
We further evaluated the HER performances of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF under full spectrum light irradiation to verify the versatility of the photothermal effect. Fig. 6a shows the HER performances of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF as a function of irradiation time in alkaline media. In the absence of light irradiation, Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF presents an onset potential of around −0.1 V vs. RHE, which can afford a current density of 100 mA cm−2 with an overpotential of 282 mV. Upon exposure to light illumination, Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF exhibits a much earlier HER onset potential of −0.06 V vs. RHE. The comparative HER activities and photothermal temperature along with irradiation time are shown in Fig. 6b. Consistent with the above OER observation, the HER overpotentials of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF gradually decrease along with the increase in photothermal temperature under continuous light illumination and reach the equilibrium after about one hour of illumination. Correspondingly, the photothermal overpotential is remarkably dropped to 218 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm−2, which is 64 mV smaller than that measured in the absence of light illumination and favorably compares with that of most of the previously reported Ni-based HER electrocatalysts, such as Ni1.8Cu0.2-P (η100 = 245 mV),56 Ni2P/NF (η100 = 314 mV),57 Ni3S2–Ni3P/NF (η100 = 257 mV),57 (Ni0.33Co0.67)S2/CC (η100 = 334 mV),58 Ni2(1−x)Mo2xP (η100 = 162 mV),41 and (Ni–Fe)Sx/NiFe(OH)y (η100 = 124 mV).42 The electrocatalytic dynamics of Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF is significantly accelerated when it is exposure to light illumination, as evidenced by the Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 6c. Obviously, the photothermal effect promotes faster charge transfer and gas evolution during the HER process. Besides the greatly enhanced HER activity, Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF also exhibits excellent stability. As shown in Fig. 6d, at a fixed current density of 50 mA cm−2, Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF can maintain nearly constant overpotential with a negligible decrease for 50 h of operation in the presence of light illumination. Meanwhile, the original structure of irradiated Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF is retained (Fig. S12a and c, ESI†) and the surface conversion of Ni2P to nickel hydroxide occurs after HER electrocatalysis (Fig. S12b and S13, ESI†). Similar to the photothermal OER, Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF shows the expected recyclability (Fig. 6e) and on–off light responses (Fig. 6f) in several cycle tests. The excellent electrocatalytic OER and HER performances reveal that Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF has great practical applications integrated with solar-to-heat conversion to catalyze water splitting at large currents.

Conclusions
In summary, ultrafine Ni2P nanoparticles anchored on porous quasi-MOF nanosheets have been successfully fabricated. Controllable thermal treatment achieves the partial deligandation and synchronous phosphorization of the MOF, effectively retaining the original nanosheet structures and promoting the in situ formation of ultrafine Ni2P nanoparticles within the quasi-MOF. The obtained Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC/NF enables favorable synergy between photothermal effect and electrocatalysis, due to its excellent light absorption and intrinsic electrochemical activity. Under full spectrum light illumination, Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC delivers 100 mA cm−2 current density at the ultralow overpotentials of 246 and 218 mV for the OER and HER, respectively, and works stably with negligible degradation at least for 50 h and good recyclability. This work offers a feasible and efficient solar-powered photothermal strategy to boost water splitting electrocatalysis.
