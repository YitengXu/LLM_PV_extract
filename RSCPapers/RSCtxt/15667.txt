    , Accepted 25th February 2019First published on 26th February 2019AbstractLead halide perovskite-based lasers have attracted much research attention due to their tunable emission colors, high gain coefficient and low threshold. Here, we demonstrated a facile solution method via temperature modulation to synthesize CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite crystals with sub-circular and quasi-cubic shapes for whispering gallery resonant mode and Fabry–Pérot mode lasing emission, respectively. A low lasing threshold of 6.4 μJ cm−2 and a full width at half maximum of 0.7 nm in an individual sub-circular cavity can be achieved at room temperature. In the quasi-cubic cavities, the Fabry–Pérot lasing oscillation modes not only exist in the horizontal directions, but also in the vertical directions according to the adjustment of the optical pumping method. The lasing thresholds and linewidths are in the range of 14–25 μJ cm−2 and 0.18–0.51 nm, respectively. This work may create possibilities for cavity design and fabrication of perovskite lasers in future potential applications.
Introduction
In the past ten years, hybrid metal halide perovskites (ABX3, A is an organic amine or caesium cation, B is a metal cation and X represents I, Br and Cl) have been one of the most promising materials in the field of optoelectronic devices, which benefit from unique properties such as broad optical absorption spectra, tunable wavelength emission and high quantum yield, long carrier lifetime and diffusion length, and low trap density and cost.1–7 Both the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells and the external quantum efficiency of perovskite light-emitting diodes have rapidly exceeded 20%. Furthermore, perovskite materials have exhibited huge potential in micro- or nano-lasers due to their excellent optical gain coefficient and low threshold.8–10
In 2014, Xing and co-workers demonstrated amplified spontaneous emission for a solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film, which indicated perovskites to be a new kind of gain media for lasers.11 The lasing behavior is not only dependent on the natural physical properties of the materials, but also on the optical cavities. One of the most important and efficient methods to improve optical-pumping lasing performances is to design cavities with a high quality (Q) factor and small mode volume (V). Strong optical coupling between the gain medium and the cavity field can be easily achieved if the value of Q/V is high, thus resulting in a low-threshold and narrow-linewidth for lasing emission.12–14 So in order to improve the performance of perovskite lasers, the design of micro-cavities with high Q values has been a key strategy. Herein, much effort has been devoted to control the growth of regular geometric shapes of perovskite crystals (micro- or nanoplates, microspheres, nanowires/nanorods and quantum dots) or nanoimprint/etching of polycrystalline films for internal cavities.15–27
For instance, well-defined triangular and hexagonal MAPbI3−aXa platelets which serve as whispering-gallery mode (WGM) cavities were first fabricated by Xiong et al., resulting in a low lasing threshold of 37 μJ cm−2.28 In 2015, Fu et al. used a one-step solution self-assembly method to obtain square CH3NH3PbBr3 micro-disks. The built-in WGM micro-resonator shows a lasing threshold of 3.6 ± 0.5 μJ cm−2.29 In addition, Song et al. reported a facile method to obtain size-controllable CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite micro-device arrays on SiO2 micro-disks.30 Recently, unique shape CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals, cube-corner pyramids, were synthesized through the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Such cavities exhibit a special Fabry–Pérot (F–P) mode by confining light in the cube-corner retroreflector and achieve laser emission with a threshold of 75 μJ cm−2 at room temperature by coating a thin Ag film.31 Zhang et al. have improved the 2D lasing performance via the synthesis of trapezoidal PbI2 nanoplatelets.32 All these studies provide diversiform approaches for the design of perovskite cavities. Inspired by previous studies, considering the self-assembly properties in crystal growth of perovskite materials, we design geometry-controllable bulk perovskite cavities via modulation of the crystal-growth conditions in order to achieve high-quality lasing emission with different modes.
Here, we mainly focused on thermal growth from an ultra-thin dropped layer of precursor solution under various temperatures, which is different from most previous studies using the anti-solvent method to precipitate crystals.29,33 Micro-sized CH3NH3PbBr3 crystals with sub-circular, square-plate and quasi-cubic shapes were alternately formed when the treating temperature was increased. Although three-dimensional (3D) perovskite crystals with cubic or square geometries have been fabricated by using solution or CVD methods, sub-circular cavities for this kind of material have not been synthesized directly, but instead by using complicated etching technology. The single micron CH3NH3PbBr3 crystals were optically pumped at room-temperature and stimulated to lase with low thresholds of 6.4–25 μJ cm−2. The relationship between the perovskite crystalline morphology and the lasing modes was also studied. We found that the oscillatory mode transformed from the WGM into the F–P mode, with the crystal morphology changing during the process of self-assembly growth. Besides, FP modes lasing both in the horizontal direction and vertical direction for quasi-cubic cavities were also observed.
Results and discussion
The morphology of the as-grown perovskite crystals was measured by using SEM to investigate the temperature-dependent shapes and sizes. The images were recorded and are shown in Fig. 1. We can see that the shapes of the crystals are sub-circular after dropping the precursor solution on the glass and drying slowly at a relatively low temperature (Fig. 1(a and b)). Most grain sizes are below 20 μm. The boundary of the sub-circular crystal is smooth and pin-holes exist around the sub-circular centre. The shapes of the crystals are mainly the co-existence of sub-circular and square thin-plates after heating at 60 °C, as can be seen from Fig. 1(c and d). With the increase of the heating temperature, the crystals are inclined to grow to be quasi-cubic shapes and the size distribution has a wide range of 5–80 μm as shown in Fig. 1(e–h). The surfaces of the perovskite crystals are relatively smooth without pin-holes after growing at 90 °C. So we can consider the pseudo-square shape as the transition state from sub-circular to quasi-cubic shapes. In order to give an insight into the crystal growth mechanism, we choose several representative SEM images obtained from low temperature to high temperature to demonstrate the behaviour of the geometric evolution (as shown in Fig. S1, ESI†). At low temperature (30 °C), small clusters are nucleated and sub-circular shapes with small sizes are generated through a surface tension force which follows the principle of minimum internal energy.14,34 The formation of the pin-holes may be due to the slow velocity of crystallization. Subsequently, the crystals transform to polygonal shapes and the corner angles gradually evolve to be cuspate when the treating temperature is in the range of 50–70 °C. With the continuous increase of temperature (80–100 °C), three-dimensional quasi-cubic crystals are formed. In fact, the perovskite crystals tend to be spontaneously formed in a cubic structure and such a growth mode is assisted by rapid nucleation with the domination of thermal energy. The reduction of the energy barrier can enhance the tendency to form large-sized crystals with low surface defects and pinholes. Additionally, the three-dimensional SEM image of quasi-cubic crystals with different edge-lengths can be seen in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It seems like an inverted pyramid structure inside the crystal. The thickness of the crystals exhibits an approximately linear relationship with the edge-length and its distribution is in the range of 3–20 μm. It can also be found that the quasi-cubic shape become a little distorted and less regular at 120 °C. When we further increased the temperature over 150 °C, the surfaces of the crystals begin to be rough and wrinkled, which may be due to the poor tolerance of perovskite materials to high temperature (see Fig. S3(a and b), ESI†). Although thermal treating can increase the orientation uniformity of the perovskite crystalline domains, degradation and distortion of the crystal morphology triggered by high thermal energy may happen if the temperature is beyond an appropriate range. Intrinsic thermal instability exists at high temperature because high temperature may cause the degradation of the organic component (methylammonium).35,36 The degradation phenomenon is especially clear under the condition of 180 °C. As can be seen in Fig. S3(c and d) (ESI†), the surfaces of crystals become discrete and rimous.

In order to further confirm the crystal structure, we performed XRD measurements on the entire area of samples on glass slides (not micro areas) and the results are summarized in Fig. 2(a). It can be clearly seen that all the samples display two dominant characteristic peaks at about 15.2° and 30.4°, which are assigned to the (001) and (002) lattice planes of the CH3NH3PbBr3 crystals, respectively. Another two obvious peaks located at about 46.1° and 62.8° indexed as the (003) and (004) crystal planes are relatively weak. These results indicate that the perovskite crystals in our case have good growth orientation and high purity. All the XRD peaks can be indexed to the lattice planes of the cubic phase of the perovskite crystals with lattice parameter a = 5.8733 Å, which is consistent with a previous report.29 The value of a is calculated according to interplanar spacing d = a/(h2 + k2 + l2)1/2. In addition, the overall growth orientation has barely changed and only the crystallinity increases initially and then decreases with the variation of temperature. The intensity of the crystallinity remains consistent with the surface morphology and crystal quality of the perovskite as reported previously.7 The pin-holes in the surfaces signify the existence of defect states, thus leading to relatively low crystallinity at low temperature. The irregular geometry morphology is the reason for the re-decrease of crystallinity in the perovskite crystals after treating at 120 °C. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the sequential and obvious decrease of XRD peak intensities when the treating temperature is gradually increased to 180 °C, which is mainly due to the degraded crystal morphology and quality caused by the high temperature, thus remaining consistent with the SEM results.

(b) The normalized micro-PL spectra from individual sub-circular, square thin-plate and quasi-cubic crystals. (c) PL images of three crystals recorded by using a CCD. 
The typical and normalized micro-PL spectra measured from single sub-circular, square and quasi-cubic crystals respectively are presented in Fig. 2(b) and the corresponding PL images are shown in Fig. 2(c). From the spectra we can see that the emission peaks are located at 548.1 nm, 551.6 nm and 554.5 nm with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 20 nm for the sub-circular, square transient-state and quasi-cubic crystals, respectively. The peak shift may be due to the difference in the crystallinity and geometry.
To estimate the lasing characteristics of different shapes of as-grown perovskite crystals, we mainly choose relatively regular sub-circular and quasi-cubic cavities as the research objects. Firstly, we performed micro-photoluminescence (μ-PL) measurements on sub-circular crystals by using 450 nm fs laser pumping at room temperature. Fig. 3 shows the lasing action from an individual sub-circular cavity with a diameter of ∼6 μm. The collected μ-PL spectra under various pump powers are shown in Fig. 3(a). The insets are the corresponding collected intensity profile image above the lasing threshold and a schematic diagram of the WGM inside of the sub-circular resonator. As presented in the collected intensity profile image, internal reflection of the optical mode is along the smooth circumference (as observed in the above SEM images) of the resonator, indicating WGMs within the sub-circular perovskite crystal. The lasing mode within the sub-circular cavity is further verified by calculating the electronic-magnetic field distribution using COMSOL Multiphysics as shown in Fig. 3(b). The green dash line is the boundary of the laser emission and the red curves represent the optical field distribution. The integrated light-in–light-out relation (L–L curve) and full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the lasing peaks are shown in Fig. 3(c). It can be found that the linewidth is broad (∼20 nm) and the collected intensity is relatively weak at low pump excitation. When we increased the pump density, a sharp peak with high intensity located between 550 and 551 nm appeared and the FWHM of the emission spectra gradually reduces to ∼0.7 nm. These results indicate a low lasing threshold of ≈6.4 μJ cm−2 for the sub-circular cavity. The WGM lasing performance in the sub-circular CH3NH3PbBr3 cavity is comparable with the micro-disk reported previously, but the use of relatively complicated etching or vapor deposition methods is avoided.

(b) Calculated magnetic field (H2) distribution of a sub-circular resonator. (c) The collected intensity (green squares) and FWHM (orange triangles) as a function of pump power. 
Subsequently, we also perform μ-PL measurements on the square crystals, however lasing emission is not easy to obtain under our experimental conditions. The μ-PL spectrum with a narrow linewidth of 4.49 nm under a relatively high fs pump power is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) and crystal perovskite degradation occurs if we continue to increase the power. We speculate that a reasonable explanation may be due to the relatively lower Q and larger volume in the square-plate compared with the sub-circular cavity; it has been demonstrated previously that circularly resonant cavities with total internal reflection tend to provide high Q.13
Finally, we investigated the lasing properties of quasi-cubic crystals with different sizes. Fig. 4(a) displays the lasing spectra of quasi-cubic crystals with edge-lengths from 45.0 μm to 6.2 μm, which are labelled as laser 1 to laser 6. A magnified lasing spectrum of an individual crystal with an edge-length of 30.0 μm is shown in Fig. 4(b). The corresponding L–L curve seen in Fig. 4(c) indicates a lasing threshold of ∼24.4 μJ cm−2. All the quasi-cubic cavities show multi-mode lasing behaviors. The mode spacing between adjacent lasing resonant peaks, defined as Δλ, is linearly dependent on the inverse of the cavity length (1/L) as shown in Fig. 4(d); the red dash line presents a linear curve fitting of the collected data. In our cases, the value of Δλ varies from 3.84 nm to 0.52 nm. The values of the linewidth are in the range of 0.18–0.51 nm. Fig. 4(e) shows the collected intensity profile images above the lasing threshold (laser 1 to laser 6). It is worth noting that if we focus the pumping laser spot on the entire surface of a single quasi-cubic crystal, only a broad PL spectrum is acquired. It may be attributed to the hollow inverted pyramid structure, which prevents the formation of an optical loop in the whole crystal. However, when we focus the laser spot on a partial region of a separate and flat side of the crystal, we can easily observe the lasing action. Herein, strong optical spots and clear interference fringes can be observed along the opposite side-edges, indicating F–P lasing modes in the horizontal directions in the quasi-cubic resonators. Different from WGM modes in sub-circular lasers, the lasing boundary of the mode intensity distribution and intense light distribution is mainly observed within a portion of a single quasi-cubic crystal. As illustrated in Fig. 4(f), the green straight line represents the boundary of a quasi-cubic crystal and the blue dash line indicates a rectangular-shape resonator with F–P modes inside of the cavity. Besides, such F–P modes are further verified by calculating the magnetic field (H2) distribution of a rectangular-shape resonator as shown in Fig. 4(g).

(e) Corresponding collected intensity profile images above the lasing threshold. (f) The schematic diagram and (g) calculated magnetic field (H2) distribution of a F–P resonator from an individual quasi-cubic perovskite crystal. 
Moreover, we found that the laser oscillation tended to be vertical F–P modes along the top and bottom sides in the larger-sized crystals (>50 μm). The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5(a) shows the lasing spectrum and the inset is the corresponding collected L–L curve. It can be clearly seen that the lasing mode spacing measured from an individual quasi-cubic cavity (L ≈ 55 μm) is about 1.7 nm. The length of the F–P cavity calculated from the above linear curve fitting between Δλ and 1/L is 13.5 μm, which is almost consistent with the thickness in the crystal with the approximate edge-length determined from Fig. S2 (ESI†). The lasing threshold is about 14.6 μJ cm−2, which is lower than the F–P mode lasing in the perovskite cube-corner pyramid cavities as reported previously.31
 Fig. 5  (a) The lasing spectrum collected from one quasi-cubic crystal (≈55 μm) and the inset data is the corresponding L–L curve. (b and c) are the fluorescence microscopy images with and without white light illumination, respectively. 

Fig. 5(b and c) show the collected intensity profile images above the lasing threshold with and without white light irradiation, respectively. Different from the collected light intensity distribution along the horizontal directions, only one strong light spot is observed on top of one side of the quasi-cubic crystal, indicating a F–P mode in the vertical direction existed in the cavity. It worth noting that the vertical F–P modes can only be detected in the larger and thicker perovskite crystals. The profiles and thickness of two different-size crystals are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). We can see that the edges on the top surfaces tend to be flat in many large-sized crystals (Fig. S6(a), ESI†), which can easily form a vertical F–P cavity between the top and bottom surfaces when we adjust the laser pumping position. However, in the small-sized crystals, obvious slopes can always be observed along the edges to central lines on the top surfaces, which might be caused by poor mass transfer during the growth process (Fig. S6(b), ESI†), thus leading to F–P oscillation along the vertical direction with a relatively low Q value. Simultaneously, there is mode competition between the horizontal and vertical directions and so F–P mode lasing tends to be easily generated in the horizontal direction in the small-sized crystals. To our best knowledge, this is the first demonstration of F–P horizontal and vertical lasing emission coexisting in micron-sized cubic CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite crystals by adjusting the optical pumping strategy.
A similar pumping method can also be applied in the measurements of the square crystal and lasing action is still not detected, because lower crystal quality and a higher defect density compared with the quasi-cubic crystals, which may lead to a lower gain coefficient, exist in the square cavity compared with the quasi-cubic cavity.
Conclusions
In summary, we report a method of geometry-variational CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite crystals grown under different temperatures by using a solution method. The crystals tend to be sub-circular at low temperature and quasi-cubic shapes with different sizes are formed with the increase of the processing temperature. Both the crystals exhibited lasing behaviors and WGM and F–P oscillation modes existed in the sub-circular and quasi-cubic cavities at room temperature, respectively. For the WGM mode cavities in the sub-circular crystals, the lasing threshold is as low as 6.4 μJ cm−2 and the FWHM is about 0.7 nm. For the F–P mode cavities in the quasi-cubic crystals, multi-mode lasing spectra are obtained and the mode spacing exhibits a linear relationship with 1/L. Additionally, lasing oscillation in both the horizontal and vertical directions is observed. They exhibit lasing thresholds and narrow linewidths in the range of 14–25 μJ cm−2 and 0.18–0.51 nm, respectively. We believe that our work can further broaden the design concept of cavities and laser pumping strategies in the field of perovskite lasers on the basis of previous research.
Experimental methods
Fabrication of CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite microcrystals
The perovskite microcrystals were synthesized by one-step solution deposition. Firstly, 0.112 g of CH3NH3Br and 0.367 g of PbBr2 (99.99%, Xi’an Polymer Light Technology) were mixed in dimethyl formamide solvent (DMF, J&K Scientific) to form a 1 M precursor solution and then stirred overnight at 60 °C. Subsequently, 5 μL of perovskite solution was dropped onto the glass substrate (10 mm × 10 mm) and spread out uniformly. Note that all the substrates were cleaned and treated with oxygen-plasma to improve the surface hydrophilicity before use. Finally, the samples were annealed under different temperatures (30 °C, 60 °C, 90 °C, 120 °C and 150 °C, respectively) for about 10 min to generate microcrystals.
Characterization
The morphology of the perovskite crystals was investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, MAlA3 model 2016, TESCAN). X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a Bruker ECO D8 (XRD, Bruker, Germany). The three-dimensional profiles and thickness of perovskite micro-crystals were measured using a 3D Measuring Laser Microscope (OLS5000-SAF, OLYMPUS).
For the lasing characterization, a 450 nm femtosecond pulsed laser was used as the excitation source (a 100 fs pulse with a 1 kHz repetition rate). The pumping laser was focused onto the micro-crystals via a ×40 objective and the laser spot diameter was controlled by manipulating the collimation of the pumping beam. The laser emission signals were collected through the same objective and were analyzed by using a spectrometer (Princeton SP-2500). The collected intensity profile of resonant modes was recorded by using a charge coupled device (CCD).
