    , Accepted 23rd January 2019First published on 25th January 2019AbstractTitanium dioxide (TiO2) is a promising photoelectrode material in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells for generating hydrogen, which is an ideal green energy carrier as it is stable, abundant, and non-toxic. However, its large band gap still forms an obstacle in the practical applications of TiO2. Achieving reduced TiO2 (TiO2−x) is regarded as a good solution. In this study, we report an efficient approach to synthesize TiO2−x by vacuum annealing. The obtained TiO2−x nanorod arrays (NRAs) were covered with a thin amorphous layer after annealing at 500 °C for 4 h, showing good photoresponse in both ultraviolet and visible light regions. The NRAs possessed narrowed band gap, increased donor density, reduced charge transport and transfer resistance and exhibited a photocurrent density of 1.62 mA cm−2 at the bias of 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, which is superior to that of pristine TiO2 NRAs (0.81 mA cm−2). Moreover, the light-induced post passivation further improved the photocurrent density to 1.82 mA cm−2. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and PEC measurements revealed that the enhancement was due to the formation of hydroxyl radicals at the surface and increased utilization of the irradiated light. Consequently, the facile vacuum annealing method has been proven to boost the PEC performance of TiO2 NRAs and could be a promising approach for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of other metal oxide semiconductors.
Introduction
Due to the limited availability of fossil fuels, extensive research efforts have been directed to the field of clean and renewable energy. H2, for which the only by-product after combustion is H2O, is considered to be an ideal fuel for powering the human beings. Since the first discovery of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using TiO2 electrode by Fujishima and Honda, TiO2-based photoelectrodes and PEC cells have drawn great research interest towards promising applications.1–4 Among all the semiconductors, TiO2 is regarded as one of the most promising materials as photoanode for hydrogen production. In the past decades, TiO2 with various structures including nanoparticles, nanowires, nanotubes, and nanospheres have been reported.5–8 Among them, single-crystalline rutile nanorods have exhibited superior PEC performance due to their relatively small band gap (3.0 eV vs. 3.2 eV of anatase), good stability (brookite is metastable), and fast electron transport rate (direct electrical pathways for photo-generated electrons).9 However, the PEC efficiency of TiO2 based photoanode is limited by its band gap which can only respond to ultraviolet (UV) light (about 5% of the solar spectrum).10 Numerous efforts have been undertaken to extend the absorption of TiO2 towards longer wavelength region, including sensitization by dye and quantum dots, chemical doping, and coupling with narrow band gap semiconductors.11–15
Although band engineering strategies can improve the response of TiO2 to longer wavelengths, the sensitivity of the modified TiO2 is still subject to the stability of the sensitizers, suitable concentration, and safety of the dopants.16–18 Recently, a dopant-free black TiO2 was successfully synthesized by Mao et al. via a high-pressure hydrogenation method.19 The black TiO2 nanoparticles showed enhanced optical absorption from the UV to near infrared region, accompanied by a distinct color change from white to black. This discovery triggered intense research interest on black TiO2, as the hydrogenation induced lattice disorder could yield mid-gap states merging with the valence band, which can lead to an enhanced photocatalytic activity. Most of these studies were performed in hydrogen environment maintained at high temperature, which are energy consuming and dangerous.20–22 An aluminum reduction approach was developed by Huang et al. to produce a core-amorphous structured black TiO2 in a two-zone tube furnace, which is much safer and facile compared to the hydrogenation method.23 Other synthetic methods such as hydrogen plasma, electrochemical reduction, and chemical oxidation have been reported for the preparation of black or reduced TiO2.24–26 However, these methods usually require expensive facilities, complicated experimental procedures, and long sample preparation time. Therefore, a more facile and versatile approach is required for preparing TiO2−x with excellent photocatalytic activity.
Herein, we have developed a thermal vacuum de-oxygenation (TVDO) method to fabricate black TiO2−x NRAs with abundant oxygen vacancies. By controlling the annealing duration, an amorphous layer with tunable thickness can be formed at the surface of the TiO2−x NRAs. The optimized TiO2−x NRAs (vacuum annealed at 500 °C for 30 min) yielded an almost doubled photocurrent density compared to pristine-TiO2 NRAs (0.81 mA cm−2), which can be attributed to the reduced band gap, lower charge transport and transfer resistance, and improved solar conversion efficiency from UV light up to the wavelength of 480 nm. The light-induced in situ oxidation further increased the photocurrent density to 1.82 mA cm−2, which is ascribed to the formation of hydroxyl radicals and elimination of redundant oxygen vacancies. This value was comparable to that of the TiO2 NRAs decorated with Si dopant or heterojunction structures formed with BiVO4. All these reported works require long procedures for the photoelectrode preparation.27,28 To the best of our knowledge, TiO2−x NRAs fabricated by simple one-step vacuum annealing have not been reported previously.
Experimental section
Synthesis of single-crystalline rutile TiO2 NRAs
Single-crystalline rutile TiO2 NRAs on FTO glass were prepared by a hydrothermal method.29 35 mL of deionized (DI) water (18.2 MΩ cm) was mixed with 35 mL of hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%, Sigma), and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. 1.05 mL of titanium butoxide (Acros) was added as the titanium precursor, followed by another 10 min stirring to form a clear solution. A piece of FTO glass (4 cm × 5 cm × 0.16 cm, square resistance = 7 Ω cm−1,2 Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co., Ltd.) was ultrasonically cleaned in a mixture of isopropanol, acetone, and deionized (DI) water (18.2 MΩ cm) with the ratio of 1:1:1 for 1 h. The cleaned FTO glass was placed in a 100 mL Teflon liner with the conducting side against the inner wall. The as-prepared solution precursor was added into the Teflon liner until the fluid level was 5 mm below the top of the FTO glass. Then, the sealed Teflon liner was transferred into a stainless-steel autoclave before it was finally placed in an electric oven at 150 °C. After the hydrothermal reaction, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature by water. The as-synthesized TiO2 NRAs were then ultrasonically cleaned by DI water for 5 min and dried under N2 to remove the surface residuals. In order to obtain the defect-deficient pristine TiO2 NRAs, the TiO2 NRAs were annealed in O2 at 500 °C for 1 h.
Synthesis of TiO2−x NRAs
The as-prepared sample was cut into 4 small pieces (1 cm × 5 cm), each of which possessed the same physical and geometric properties. The TiO2−x NRAs were prepared in a rapid annealing furnace (OTF-1200X) at a pressure lower than 5 mTorr. The TiO2 NRAs were annealed at 500 °C for 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min (named as TiO2−x-15, TiO2−x-30, and TiO2−x-60, respectively) to obtain the amorphous layers with controllable thickness. The heating rate was 10 °C s−1.
Characterization of TiO2−x NRAs
The crystal structure of the TiO2−x NRAs was studied using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku SmartLab) with Cu Kα monochromatic radiation. The morphology of the TiO2−x NRAs was characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6335F). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded using the Tecnai F10 microscope. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the TiO2 NRAs were recorded on a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV 3600) combined with an integrating sphere. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained on a PHI 5802 XPS with Al Kα radiation, and the peaks were calibrated by C 1s at 284.6 eV. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX-8 spectrometer at 9.0 GHz frequency. In order to maintain the single electron trapping by the oxygen vacancies, the EPR measurement was conducted at 77 K.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The PEC properties were measured in a typical three-electrode cell, in which the TiO2−x NRAs, an Ag/AgCl electrode, and a Pt plate were used as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. All the data were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E). All the measurements were performed in Na2SO4 solution (0.2 M, pH = 7). Prior to the measurement, the edges of the working electrodes were sealed with epoxy resin and the electrolyte was purged with a N2 flow for 20 min to remove the dissolved O2. Photoresponse of the TiO2 NRAs was measured under simulated solar light with a power of 100 mW cm−2. The light source was generated by a 300 W Xenon lamp equipped with an air mass global (AM 1.5G) filter (Beijing NBET Technology Co., Ltd.). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement was performed at 1.23 V vs. RHE in the range of 300–600 nm. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured in both dark and illuminated conditions at open circuit voltage over a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100000 Hz with an alternating current (AC) amplitude of 10 mV. The EIS measurements for the Mott–Schottky plots were performed at the frequency of 1000 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV to determine the donor density. The donor density was calculated from the corresponding slope according to the following eqn (1): (1)where C, Nd, e, ε0, and ε represent the space charge capacitance, donor density, elemental charge value, the permittivity of a vacuum, and dielectric constant of the semiconductor (170 for rutile TiO2), respectively.30 It is worth noting that in the previous PEC measurements, the photoanode was sealed with epoxy resin to prevent the leakage of photo-generated electrons. However, in the long-time stability test, the epoxy resin was found to detach from the photoanode one hour after the start of measurement, resulting in the increased exposure window. Therefore, the photocurrent densities in the stability test were obtained from the unsealed photoanodes.
Results and discussions
The morphology and crystal size of the TiO2−x NRAs were characterized using SEM and HRTEM. In Fig. 1b, it can be seen that the diameter of the TiO2−x NRAs is ∼100 nm. SEM image (Fig. 1a) further confirms that the TiO2 NRAs are ∼1 μm in length. After the vacuum thermal annealing, a unique amorphous layer formed on the surface of these TiO2 NRAs (Fig. 1d). The thickness of the amorphous layer increases as the annealing time is prolonged from 15 min (2.5 nm) to 60 min (3.8 nm), as shown in Fig. S1a,† 1b, and 1c. Two sets of lattice fringes with spacing of 0.261 nm and 0.322 nm are clearly observed, corresponding to the {101} and {110} atomic planes of the rutile TiO2 (Fig. 1d). XRD pattern (Fig. S2†) further confirmed that no phase change happened after the thermal vacuum annealing due to the good thermal stability of rutile TiO2.

After annealing the pristine TiO2 NRAs in vacuum, the color of these TiO2 NRAs changed from white to gray and became darker as the annealing time was prolonged. Fig. 2a shows the absorption spectra of pristine TiO2 NRAs and TiO2−x NRAs. All the vacuum annealed samples depicted an extended absorbance in the visible region. Moreover, the absorption edges also shifted to longer wavelength when the annealing duration was increased. In order to obtain the information of chemical bonding and valence band position of the as-prepared TiO2 NRAs, XPS measurements were performed. Fig. 2b shows the Ti 2p core level XPS spectra of pristine TiO2 NRAs and TiO2−x NRAs. Compared to the spectrum of the pristine TiO2 NRAs, the location of the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks of the TiO2−x NRAs were slightly shifted to lower binding energy, indicating the formation of Ti3+. Therefore, we can propose that Ti3+ (oxygen vacancy) can be successfully introduced into the pristine TiO2 NRAs through a simple one-step annealing in vacuum.

In order to obtain the band gap values of the TiO2 NRAs, the Tauc plots (αhν)1/2vs. hν were calculated from their absorption spectra by assuming a direct transition in the rutile TiO2 crystal (Fig. 3a). The band gap of pristine TiO2 NRAs is 2.96 eV, which is smaller than the standard value as the TiO2 NRAs were prepared through a hydrothermal method in which the intrinsic defect could not be completely removed after post-annealing in O2. The band gap energy is reduced continuously from 2.92 eV of TiO2−x-15 NRAs to 2.87 eV of TiO2−x-60 NRAs. All the vacuum annealed samples exhibited even smaller band gap values, suggesting that the vacuum annealing can induce more defects. The positions of VBM of these TiO2 NRAs were also measured by the XPS. The pristine TiO2 NRAs displayed typical valence band edge with a maximum energy at 2.97 eV. Since the optical band gap of the pristine TiO2 NRAs is 2.96 eV as obtained from the Tauc plots, the conduction band minimum is calculated to be located at 0.01 eV. After annealing the sample in vacuum for 15 min, the VBM position is shifted upward to 2.91 eV, whereas for TiO2−x-30 and TiO2−x-60 NRAs, the VBM positions are almost identical to that of the TiO2−x-15 NRAs, but with clear tails extending from the valence band to 2.64 eV and 2.51 eV for TiO2−x-30 and TiO2−x-60 NRAs, respectively. This can be attributed to the generation of additional localized states above the valence band edge by the disordered layers and defects induced by vacuum annealing.31 The localized states can also act as traps for photoexcited electrons and holes, which may improve the charge separation and enhance the photocurrent density.32 Combined with the Tauc plots, the conduction bands of TiO2−x-15, TiO2−x-30, and TiO2−x-60 NRAs are located at 0.01 eV, −0.03 eV, and −0.06 eV, respectively. A schematic of the band structures of pristine TiO2 NRAs and TiO2−x NRAs is shown in Fig. 3c.

The linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) of all the as-prepared samples are displayed in Fig. 4a. The dark currents measured without illumination are negligible compared to the currents measured under simulated solar irradiation (Fig. S3†). For the pristine TiO2 NRAs, the onset potential is 0.49 V vs. RHE. However, the onset potentials of TiO2−x NRAs are anodic shifted to about 0.64 V vs. RHE, which can be attributed to the high charge recombination rate caused by the redundant Ti3+. The photocurrent density of the pristine TiO2 NRAs increases from about 0.05 mA cm−2 to 0.65 mA cm−2 between a potential window of 0.45 V to 1.05 V vs. RHE. For the other vacuum annealed samples in the same potential window, the currents are abruptly increased from 0.05 mA cm−2 to 1.27 mA cm−2, 1.35 mA cm−2, and 1.42 mA cm−2 for TiO2−x-60, TiO2−x-15, and TiO2−x-30 NRAs, respectively. Below the potential window, the system is unable to reach the required kinetic overpotentials for the reaction, and few of the photo-generated electrons are collected. When the bias is larger than the window, the photoanode is unable to generate more electrons, thus a saturation photocurrent density is observed. Apparently, the maximum photocurrent was measured from the TiO2−x-30 NRAs, which is over two times larger than that of pristine TiO2 NRAs, illustrating the more efficient collection of photo-generated electrons. This was also confirmed by the results of transient photocurrent responses (Fig. 4b). After 5 on/off cycles of illumination, the photocurrent densities of pristine, TiO2−x-15, TiO2−x-30, and TiO2−x-60 NRAs were stabilized at 0.81 mA cm−2, 1.55 mA cm−2, 1.68 mA cm−2, and 1.47 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively. All the samples exhibited rapid response to the light, indicating that the as-prepared rutile single-crystalline TiO2 NRAs are of good quality. The enhancement is due to the formation of optimal amount of oxygen vacancies in the outer amorphous layer, in which the conductivity is much higher than that of pristine TiO2 NRAs, thus facilitating the charge transportation, whereas, 60 min annealing generates a much thicker amorphous layer, which can block the irradiated light and result in a reduced photocurrent density.

In order to investigate the charge transfer properties at the semiconductor–electrolyte interfaces, EIS measurement was performed. In typical Nyquist plots, there are three parts: the bulk resistance in the high-frequency region, the charge transfer resistance between the electrodes and electrolyte in the intermediate-frequency region, and diffusion resistance of electrolyte in the low-frequency region.33 We performed the measurements of pristine and vacuum annealed samples measured in the dark and under illumination conditions. From Fig. 5a, it is clear that all the curves contain two parts: the first semicircle represents the bulk resistance of the electrodes in the high-frequency region and the other part corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance in the intermediate-frequency region. The diffusion resistance of the electrolyte is too large to be measured in the selected frequency region. In the high-frequency region, it is obvious that the TiO2−x NRAs exhibit smaller radii than the pristine TiO2 NRAs, indicating that the existence of Ti3+ can improve the conductivity of TiO2 NRAs. In the dark condition, charge transfer dominates the process due to the small bulk resistance of the film. The charge-transfer resistance is also gradually reduced as the annealing time is prolonged, attributable to the increased amount of Ti3+ which generates a stronger built-in electric field that in turn facilitates the charge transfer process. Nevertheless, when the samples were illuminated with simulated AM 1.5G (Fig. 5c), a distinct arc was found in the intermediate region and the arc radius gradually decreased as the annealing time was prolonged due to the stronger built-in electric field, which facilitated more efficient charge separation.

To further reveal the photoactivity of the pristine TiO2 NRAs and TiO2−x NRAs as a function of the wavelength of incident light, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed with the incident wavelength range from 300 nm to 600 nm at a bias of 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5d). The IPCE values were calculated by the following eqn (2): IPCE = (1240I)/λJlight(2)where I, λ, and Jlight are the photocurrent density, incident light wavelength, and measured irradiance, respectively.34Fig. 5f shows that all vacuum annealed samples exhibiting enhanced photoactivity up to 480 nm. The highest IPCE values of all the samples were collected at 380 nm, indicating that the 380 nm light can be effectively used for water splitting. Particularly, the highest IPCE value of 36.2% at 380 nm was recorded from TiO2−x-30 NRAs, which is improved by 87.6% compared to that of pristine TiO2 NRAs (19.3%). TiO2−x-15 NRAs also exhibited enhanced IPCE values compared to the pristine sample. However, with further increase in the annealing time duration to one hour, the IPCE value did not increase as expected. On the contrary, the IPCE value of TiO2−x-60 NRAs was only 27.3% at 380 nm. Moreover, TiO2−x NRAs show extended photoresponse in the longer wavelength (420–480 nm) region, resulting in higher IPCE values compared to that of pristine TiO2 NRAs. Although the improvement of IPCE is still low, it is a strong evidence for the visible light photoresponse of TiO2−x NRAs. These results are consistent with the UV-vis results.
Mott–Schottky plots were measured to make a qualitative comparison of the donor density between the pristine and vacuum annealed samples. In Fig. 5e, all the samples display a positive slope, which is a direct evidence of n-type semiconductor behavior.35 Furthermore, TiO2−x NRAs show smaller slopes compared to that of the pristine TiO2 NRAs. The calculated donor densities of pristine TiO2, TiO2−x-15, TiO2−x-30, and TiO2−x-60 NRAs are 7.5 × 1019 cm−3, 1.7 × 1020 cm−3, 2.7 × 1020 cm−3, and 3.0 × 1020 cm−3, respectively, indicating an increase in the donor density after vacuum annealing. The dramatic increase in the donor densities of vacuum annealed samples is attributed to the introduction of Ti3+, which can serve as a shallow donor. Consequently, the Fermi level in the TiO2−x NRAs shifts upwards, leading to larger bending in the band edge at the surface, and therefore, facilitates the charge separation at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte, and becomes favourable for the water splitting process.
The stability of the TiO2−x-30 NRAs was further tested without sealing with the epoxy resin. Surprisingly, in contrary to normal photoanodes, the photocurrent density gradually increased from 1.58 mA cm−2 to 1.82 mA cm−2 in the first 400 seconds, before it reached a plateau, and no distinct drop of photocurrent density was detected after 7000 seconds (Fig. 6a). The open-circuit potential (OCP) results reveal that the photovoltage of TiO2−x-30-A NRAs is enhanced after a long duration of light irradiation, contributing to the improvement of the photocurrent (Fig. S4†). The influence of using a sacrificial reagent is also considered (Fig. S5†). It was found that Na2S could improve the PEC performance of TiO2−x NRAs without affecting the photoresponse. However, the photocurrent was not stable and decreased continuously as the measurement time became longer. Hence, the experiment is favourably performed without using sacrificial reagents. Therefore, it is worth characterizing the TiO2−x-30 NRAs after the stability test (TiO2−x-30-A NRAs) to explore the mechanism.

UV-vis measurements were performed to detect the changes in light absorption properties of TiO2 NRAs before and after the stability test. As shown in Fig. 6b, the TiO2−x-30 NRAs exhibit stronger light absorption compared to TiO2−x-30-A NRAs, which is due to the existence of a large amount of oxygen vacancies. Since the TiO2−x-30 NRAs are pale grey, the colour change is insufficient to be detected by normal vision or a camera. In order to emphasize the difference between the samples before and after the long duration AM 1.5G irradiation, two photos of the TiO2 NRAs (vacuum annealed for 3 hours) before and after the four-hour stability test are shown in the inset of Fig. 6b. Clearly, the TiO2−x NRAs can absorb more light before the stability test, since the surface amorphous layer is very thin and can block most of the light from reaching the inner part of the TiO2 NRAs, resulting in reduced utilization of light.
To confirm the oxidation of Ti3+ on the surface of the TiO2−x NRAs after the stability test, XPS and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) characterization were performed. Fig. 7a shows the O 1s XPS spectra of TiO2−x-30 NRAs and TiO2−x-30-A NRAs. In the spectrum of TiO2−x-30-A NRAs, one strong peak with a binding energy value of 529.9 eV is attributed to the Ti–O–Ti band in the TiO2 crystal lattice, while a shoulder located at 1.5–1.8 eV higher binding energy belongs to the hydroxyl groups, such as Ti–OH and H2O.36,37 Since the molecular water that was physically absorbed on the surface of TiO2 can be easily removed under the ultrahigh vacuum condition in the XPS system, the shoulder peak should be attributed to the Ti–OH bond.38 As expected, the peaks of both Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2P1/2 in the XPS spectrum of TiO2−x-30-A NRAs show a small shift of about 0.2 eV to larger binding energies (Fig. 7b), which is due to the decreased amount of Ti3+.

However, one crucial task is to clarify the existence of oxygen vacancies after the stability test. In fact, after the oxygen vacancies are generated by vacuum annealing, a single electron would form after O escapes from the lattice and is usually trapped by the oxygen vacancies. These trapped single electrons can produce active EPR response and give a value of 2.001–2.005.39 As shown in Fig. 7c, the peak intensity of pristine TiO2 NRAs at a g value of 2.003 is weak, attributed to the intrinsic oxygen vacancies that are generated by the hydrothermal method. The TiO2−x-30 NRAs show the strongest peak among all the three samples, indicating that a large amount of oxygen vacancies is successfully introduced into the TiO2 NRAs, which is in good agreement with the Ti 2p XPS results. The EPR signal of TiO2−x-30 NRAs became weak after the stability test, due to the oxidization of oxygen vacancies by the photo-generated holes. However, the oxygen vacancies are not fully consumed, as the EPR signal is still stronger than that of pristine TiO2 NRAs, which is possibly due to the formed hydroxyl groups passivating the TiO2−x NRAs. Those oxygen vacancies located deep in the surface thus cannot be filled by O atoms or react with hydroxyl radicals from the electrolyte.
The electronic structure of TiO2−x NRAs is one of the most important factors that determines various properties, such as optical absorption, photocatalytic activity, and conductivity.40 Therefore, density of states (DOS) calculations were performed to explain the above results. In order to make a comparison, the total DOS of Ti5O10, Ti5O9, and Ti5O9H2 structures, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO), and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of each atom in these structures (in Fig. S4†) were calculated. For the stoichiometric structure (Ti5O10), the gap between the HOMO and LUMO is the largest one among all the three structures (Fig. 8a). Through the projected DOS (PDOS) of each atom, it is also obvious that the HOMO is mainly contributed to by O atoms, while most of the contribution to the LUMO is observed from the Ti atoms. Once one O atom is removed from the Ti5O10, the structure becomes analogous to the reduced TiO2, and the gap between the HOMO and LUMO becomes narrowed, which is due to the emergence of a new HOMO peak that is contributed to by the Ti atoms (Fig. 8b). Such a feature coincides with previous studies.41 When hydroxyl radicals are formed on the surface of TiO2−x, the structure becomes Ti5O9H2 with two H atoms attached to two O atoms (Fig. 8c). It is surprising that the gap becomes even smaller compared to the other two structures, with appearance of one additional HOMO peak contributed to by the Ti atoms, which can increase the light absorption as well as improve the conductivity with more delocalized orbital distribution. Furthermore, our previous research found that a TiO2 structure with small ratio of O atoms has a better reactivity than the stoichiometric TiO2.42 All these theoretical studies help to explain the improvement of the photoelectrochemical performance of TiO2 and are consistent with the experimental results.
 Fig. 8  (a) and (b) are the TDOS and PDOS of Ti5O9 and Ti5O9H2, respectively. 
In order to clarify the improvement of the photocurrent density in the stability test, PEC measurements were also performed to investigate the TiO2−x-30 and TiO2−x-30-A NRAs. The EIS was compared under AM 1.5 illumination (Fig. 9a). Obviously, after the stability test, the radius in the intermediate-frequency region becomes larger; whereas, it becomes smaller in the high-frequency region. This is because the Ti3+ ion is metastable and can be oxidized by the photo-generated holes. Once the Ti3+ reacts with the holes, an ultra-thin TiO2 layer is formed at the surface, prohibiting the charge transfer at the interface. In the high-frequency region, the reduced charge-transport resistance is due to the formation of hydroxyl groups that can delocalize the molecular orbitals and therefore improve the conductivity, as confirmed by DFT calculations.

Mott–Schottky plots were also measured for the TiO2−x-30 and TiO2−x-30-A NRAs (Fig. 9c). Interestingly, oxygen vacancy/Ti3+ is reported to be the donor in an n-type semiconductor and can be oxidized by the photo-generated holes. However, after the stability test, TiO2−x-30-A NRAs show a smaller slope than the TiO2−x-30 NRAs. This is because the formed hydroxyl groups on the surface of TiO2−x-30-A NRAs result in an increased pseudocapacitance, which was confirmed by the O 1s XPS results.
The enhancement mechanism can be concluded as follows: vacuum annealing introduces a large amount of oxygen vacancies at the surface of the TiO2 NRAs, which narrows the band gap and elevates the valence band position of the TiO2 NRAs. Such an amorphous shell, possessing good conductivity and small band gap, facilitates the charge transportation and light absorption. In situ surface oxidation can improve the light absorption by consuming the redundant oxygen vacancies and reducing the charge-transport resistance by forming hydroxyl groups at the surface of the TiO2−x NRAs. The decrease in oxygen vacancies allows more light to be utilized in photocatalytic water splitting and the existence of hydroxyl groups can facilitate the charge transportation. All these findings lead to a further improved PEC performance.
Conclusions
The TiO2−x NRAs on FTO have been successfully prepared by a simple thermal treatment under vacuum in a rapid annealing furnace and can directly be used as a photoanode in a PEC cell for water splitting. A considerable amount of oxygen vacancies was successfully introduced into the TiO2 NRAs, resulting in an oxygen-deficient amorphous layer. The thickness of the amorphous layer can be controlled by varying the annealing time. Moreover, the TiO2−x NRAs exhibit lower charge transport and transfer resistance, higher donor density and improved photocatalytic performance in both UV and visible light regions, leading to an enhanced PEC performance. The photocurrent density of the optimized TiO2 NRAs (vacuum annealed at 500 °C for 30 min) is 1.68 mA cm−2 (with epoxy sealed photoanode) at 1.23 V vs. RHE in 0.2 M Na2SO4, which is about two times of that of the pristine NRAs. The photocurrent was further improved to 1.82 mA cm−2 (with unsealed photoanode) after the post-oxidation process, which is attributed to the decreased ratio of oxygen vacancies and formation of hydroxyl groups at the surface. The TVDO method may provide a novel path for improving the photocatalytic properties of other metal oxide semiconductors, and the TiO2−x NRAs are hoped to be further modified, such as by doping and forming heterojunctions with other semiconductors, for the enhanced PEC performance and extended applications.
