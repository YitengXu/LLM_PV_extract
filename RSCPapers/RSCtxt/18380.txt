    , Accepted 8th July 2021First published on 9th July 2021AbstractThe present critical review reports progress over the last 10 years in the heterogeneous photocatalytic conversion to produce value-added organic products that have the potential to provide a green synthesis route for a number of industrially important chemicals. Most attention has been paid to the oxidation and reduction of organic compounds in the presence of photocatalysts. There has also been consideration of the conversion of biomass. Nowadays, titanium dioxide is the most abundant photocatalytic material due to its photoactivity under ultraviolet illumination, stability under commonly used reaction conditions and high surface area. Despite obvious achievements in the field of photocatalysis, the most significant limitation of TiO2 is its large band gap for different crystalline phases, which makes it possible to use only ultraviolet illumination to initiate photocatalytic processes. With a view to efficient solar-energy utilisation, the development of new photocatalysts, which are sensitive to visible light, is an important direction in the theory and practice of heterogeneous photocatalysis. In this regard, a special focus of this critical review is on the use of metal–organic frameworks in photocatalytic reactions because they have emerged as an interesting class of materials for applications in organic photoreactions due to their flexible tunability in composition, structure and functional properties, facilitated adsorption towards chemicals, and efficient light absorption.
1. Introduction
Technological progress of the 20th and 21st centuries has led to serious environmental problems that must be solved in the near future. These problems include the depletion of non-renewable energy sources (oil, gas, and coal), environmental pollution, and greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide, methane, etc.) emissions.1
One of the principles of green chemistry declares that “catalytic reagents (as selective as possible) are superior to stoichiometric reagents”.2,3 This involves the use of the full breadth of catalysis, including heterogeneous photocatalytic systems. Investigations into photocatalytic processes could solve issues related to environmental pollution and depletion of non-renewable resources. The rapid development of research in the field of photocatalysis reflects the desire of humanity for a more rational use of the energy resources that it possesses. In this regard, the most important aspect is the use of solar energy to decompose pollutants or carry out chemical transformations to obtain value-added products.4 When the energy of a photon is higher than the band gap energy (Eg) of the photocatalyst, it can be absorbed, resulting in the promotion of an electron from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), leading to the formation of a hole in the VB. There are several active species, including free radicals, such as HO˙, O2˙−, and HO2˙, that could be generated if the photoinduced electrons and holes have enough energy.
Nowadays, the most popular heterogeneous photocatalyst, titanium dioxide, has already found commercial application for water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen;5,6 degradation of organic pollutants (e.g., methylene blue, methyl orange, rhodamine B);7,8 air purification;9 and the creation of self-cleaning coatings.10
On the other hand, the production of organic substances using heterogeneous photocatalysis has great practical interest. Organic chemicals are essential for obtaining a great number of products, such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and food additives, that are an integral part of human life. Moreover, conventional industrial routes to many important organic chemicals typically require harsh reaction conditions (temperature and pressure), and the development of photocatalytic synthesis routes under much milder conditions is a real challenge.
In our opinion, the most important organic chemicals, which are obtained via reductive pathways or oxidative pathways, are:
(1) methanol, formic acid, methane, and ethane, which can be produced by the reduction of carbon dioxide;11–13
(2) aniline, which can be produced by the reduction of nitrobenzene;14
(3) phenol, which can be produced by the hydroxylation of benzene in the gaseous or liquid phase;15
(4) other oxygen-containing organic chemicals, e.g., aldehydes and alcohols, which can be produced by the oxidation of alcohols and alkanes, respectively.16,17
An interesting approach for scientists is the conversion of renewables, since biomass represents an important, available, and renewable carbon source.18
As mentioned above, titanium dioxide is the most abundant photocatalytic material. TiO2 is of particular interest in catalysis due to its photoactivity under ultraviolet (UV) illumination, stability under commonly used reaction conditions and high surface area.19,20 It is known that titanium dioxide is usually found to have three different crystalline structures: rutile, anatase, and brookite. Despite obvious achievements in the field of photocatalysis, the most significant limitation of TiO2 is its large band gap (Eg) for different crystalline phases (anatase – 3.2 eV, rutile – 3.0 eV, and brookite – 3.4 eV),21–23 which makes it possible to use only the UV region to initiate photocatalytic processes. However, solar energy that reaches the ground has around 5% UV light, 45% visible light and 50% near-infrared (NIR) light.4,24 With a view to efficient solar-energy utilisation, the development of new photocatalysts, which are sensitive to visible and NIR light, and methods for shifting the photosensitivity of TiO2-based catalysts to the visible region are important directions in the theory and practice of heterogeneous photocatalysis.
A large number of excellent reviews on photocatalytic organic synthesis have been published over the past 10 years. Six general reviews have been published by Vorontsov and Arsentyev,25 Cherevatskaya and König,26 Munir et al.,27 Friedmann et al.,16 Radhika et al.,28 and Gisbertz and Pieber.29 Other relevant reviews have been more specific. In particular, Mancuso et al.15 focused on the catalytic and photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol in the liquid phase. Granone et al.18 summarised recent advances in the strategy and mechanistic considerations for the application of photocatalytic and photochemical reactions in the conversion of biomass into valuable products. Song et al.14 reviewed recent progress on the development of catalytic materials used in the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes. The use of heterogeneous photocatalysts for the selective oxidation of alcohols and hydrocarbons to useful oxygen-containing organics has been reviewed by Chen et al.17
A huge number of review publications are devoted to the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to organic chemicals.11–13,30–34 This topic is both important from a CO2 capturing perspective for pollution prevention and for its potential to produce a wide range of useful chemicals. Significant advances have been made in this field.16 For example, Ola and Maroto-Valer35 presented a review dedicated to the current conditions, limitations, correlations and possibilities of existing systems (photocatalysts and reactors) for CO2 photoreduction. Lais et al.36 and Ramyashree et al.37 reviewed photocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol in the presence of titanium dioxide and metal–organic frameworks, respectively. The fundamentals and applications of the photocatalytic methanation of carbon dioxide have been considered by Ulmer et al.33 Finally, Pan and Heagy34 discussed photocatalytic CO2 reduction to formic acid.
Given the recent surge of activity in the field of the use of photocatalytic systems in practically important organic synthesis, an updated review is urgently needed. In this critical review, we will highlight achievements in the field of heterogeneous photocatalytic organic synthesis and discuss the mechanisms, conversions, yields and selectivity of a number of studied reactions. Moreover, it is important to consider the possibility of applying the described methods in practice on an industrial scale. The main focus will be on oxidation (section 3) and reduction (section 4) in the presence of photocatalysts. We will also consider the conversion of biomass in this review (section 5). Special attention in each section will be devoted to the use of metal–organic frameworks in photocatalytic reactions. We also suppose that it is necessary to outline the basic principles of photocatalysis, as well as the development of this process in the 20th century (section 2). The authors believe that this review will help colleagues in the scientific community who are actively involved in the development of photocatalytic systems for the production of organic chemicals.
2. Background
2.1. Heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysis: an historical aspect
Photocatalysis is defined as the “acceleration of a photogenerated electron in the presence of a catalyst”, in which the catalyst neither undergoes any changes nor is consumed in the reaction.38
To the best of our knowledge, the term “photocatalysis” appeared in several scientific communications in 1911, when Alexander Eibner studied the effect of the illumination of zinc oxide on the bleaching of Prussian blue.39 This observation inspired subsequent experiments of using ZnO as a photocatalyst for other reactions, such as the reduction of Ag+ to Ag in 1924.40 In 1932, it was found that TiO2 and Nb2O5 were able to photocatalyse the reduction of AgNO3 to Ag and AuCl3 to Au.41 Following this line of research, Goodeve and Kitchener investigated the ability of titanium dioxide to act as a photosensitizer to bleach dyes in the presence of oxygen in 1938.42 This work reported that UV absorption produced active oxygen species on the TiO2 surface, causing the discoloration of organic chemicals by photooxidation.39 Nevertheless, despite the impressive initial results, interest in photocatalysis was not so great until the 1960s. In 1964, Russian scientists published an article where the results of isopropanol photooxidation on ZnO and TiO2 were shown.43 Similar studies were conducted in parallel by Japanese scientists.44
The publication of Fujishima and Honda45 is considered to be a real breakthrough in photocatalysis. In this paper, the authors showed that water could be decomposed by near-UV light into oxygen and hydrogen using rutile TiO2. The importance of this work is difficult to overestimate, since a large number of semiconductor photocatalysts for various reactions were proposed later. For example, Schrauzer and Guth46 investigated the reduction of N2 to NH3 in the presence of titanium dioxide. Heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation of cyanide and sulphite in aqueous solutions of TiO2, ZnO and CdS was studied by Frank and Bard.47 The authors showed that cyanide (CN−) could be efficiently converted into cyanate (CNO−) under alkaline conditions in the presence of photocatalysts. Inoue et al.48 reported the photoelectrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to form organic compounds such as formic acid, formaldehyde, methyl alcohol, and methane in the presence of photosensitive semiconductor powders (TiO2, WO3, ZnO, GaP, SiC, CdS) suspended in water as catalysts.
From then until now, investigations have focused on understanding the fundamental principles, enhancing the photocatalytic efficiencies, and searching for new photocatalysts.49
2.2. The most common photocatalysts
In this sub-section, we summarise the main photocatalytic systems used to produce organic chemicals.

2.2.1. Titanium dioxide. 
Nowadays, the most common types of semiconductor catalysts used in various photocatalytic reactions are inexpensive and naturally abundant transition-metal oxides, especially titanium dioxide. The extensive use of this material is also associated with its low toxicity, high efficiency, and high stability.50,51 Pure titanium oxide has three common mineral phases (anatase, rutile and brookite), which have different efficiencies in photocatalysis. However, TiO2 has some disadvantages, including a high band gap energy, which only responds to UV light and leads to a higher electron–hole recombination level.
One of the main methods to enhance the activity of the titanium dioxide photocatalyst in organic reactions is its surface modification by doping with metals such as Cu, Ni, Pt, Pd,52 Au, Ag,53 and Ce.54 Doping with elements is conducted to sensitise the TiO2 photocatalyst with a wide band gap towards visible light absorption. However, the doping technique can lead to metal leaching and, consequently, catalyst deactivation. Apparently, catalyst deactivation is due to the photocorrosion of doped TiO2.55 The preparation of metal-doped TiO2 is also of high cost, especially for those catalysts employing noble metals. To solve these issues, the use of non-metals has become an interesting preparation method in developing photocatalysts that are efficient in the visible light region.56,57


2.2.2. Other metal oxides. 
Commonly used metal oxides in the production of valuable organic chemicals include ZnO,58 CeO2,59 CuO,60 SnO2,61 WO3,62 Al2O3,63 and Fe2O3.64 Generally, metal oxides exhibit a large band gap, thus making them inefficient in absorbing visible light. However, modification (e.g., doping) methods can be optimised to allow for the efficient use of solar energy. Metal oxide semiconductors have the advantages of being inexpensive, easy to prepare and stable.65


2.2.3. Perovskite oxides. 
The perovskite oxides (ABO3), where A and B denote two different cations, originate from CaTiO3 and are widely used for various photocatalytic organic transformations owing to their high stability, structural tunability and excellent activity. There are many research articles devoted to applying perovskite oxides, such as CaTiO3,66 SrTiO3,67 and Bi2WO6,68 in photocatalysis. Nowadays, the following techniques have been described to enhance the perovskite photocatalytic activity: doping with metals and non-metals (Cr, Ni, Mn, Pb, Bi, N, Br, S, C and F), modification with noble metal (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, Ph and Ru) nanoparticles (NPs) and doping with rare earth elements (La). It should be noted that there are two relevant reviews,69,70 where characterisation, preparation, and the photocatalytic properties of the perovskite oxides are discussed in detail.


2.2.4. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). 
Graphitic carbon nitride is considered to be a promising metal-free photocatalyst due to its stability, unique electronic structure and effective light harvesting accompanied by a suitable band gap energy of 2.7 eV.71 Especially, g-C3N4-based photocatalysts have attracted interest worldwide since photocatalytic H2 and O2 production under visible light was first investigated in 2009.72 Nowadays, this material is widely used in photocatalytic water reduction and oxidation,73 the degradation of organic pollutants,74 CO275 and nitroaromatic76 reduction, alcohols,77 and hydrocarbon78 oxidation. However, pure g-C3N4 has some disadvantages that restrict its application in photocatalytic processes, e.g., low absorption ability for solar light and the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs at a high rate, leading to low photocatalytic activity. Modification of graphitic carbon nitride with metals (Fe, Ag, Co, Mn) and non-metals (B, S, P, F) or developing composites of g-C3N4 with classic semiconductors (TiO2, ZnO, CdS, Bi2WO6) can improve its photocatalytic performance.79


2.2.5. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). 
Most of the common photocatalysts used are not practical due to their wide band gaps (e.g., 3.0–3.5 for TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, CeO2; see Table 1) and low activity under visible light conditions. MOFs are interesting materials that can act as hybridizing photosensitizers and semiconductors within one porous photocatalyst network,83 with theoretical band gaps ranging from 1.0 to 5.5 eV due to the structural nature of the metal nodes and organic linkers.84 Nowadays, metal organic frameworks are actively used for gas storage/separation,85 sensing86 and catalysis.87 MOFs have vital advantages over classical heterogeneous catalysts, e.g., tunable porosity (micro-/mesopores), high surface area (1000–10000 m2 g−1), high pore volume (up to 4.4 m3 g−1), variety of metals, acceptable thermal stability (up to 200 °C), and diversity in structural topologies and physicochemical properties. Theoretically, metal–organic frameworks can be defined as functional coordination polymers with flexible porous network architectures and controllable open channels/pores in a 3D space (Fig. 1). Each metal cluster in the MOF material can act as an inorganic semiconductor quantum dot, and the linker in a MOF can act as a light-harvesting antenna. This phenomenon is known as a linker to cluster charge transition. Electrons and holes are generated in the metal centers and subsequently transferred to the surface to induce a heterogeneous photoredox reaction, such as water splitting, CO2 reduction, and organic chemical synthesis. Numerous attempts have been made to explore the potential application of MOFs as a new class of photocatalysts. A large number of reviews, devoted to the use of metal–organic frameworks in photocatalysis, have been published over the past 5 years. Most of them (2017–2021)88–104 are chronologically listed in Table 2. As can be seen from Table 2, the main focus of the review articles has been on the use of MOFs in photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, CO2 reduction and hydrogen production. However, MOF applications in practically important organic reactions, such as reduction of nitroaromatics, and oxidation of hydrocarbons and alcohols, have been described briefly.

2.3. Requirements for photocatalysts
There are a number of requirements that should be followed for the effective implementation of the process:1,106
(1) The photocatalyst should be corrosion stable under the reaction conditions.
(2) The light should be effectively absorbed by the photocatalyst with the formation of electron–hole pairs.
(3) The process of electron and hole bulk recombination should be minimised. Reducing the photocatalyst particle size usually leads to the dominance of the migration of electrons and holes to the reaction centers over their bulk recombination.
(4) The bulk separation of active sites and modification of the photocatalyst lead to irreversible photochemical reactions. These methods prevent contact between the oxidised products and reduction reaction sites.107
(5) There is a correlation between the specific surface area of a photocatalyst and its photocatalytic activity. The number of active centers increases with increasing specific surface area.108,109
(6) The band gap energy has a dual effect. Photocatalysts with Eg < 3.0 eV can absorb visible light, while photocatalysts with wider band gaps are catalytically active only under UV irradiation. On the other hand, the rate of the photocatalytic reaction increases with an increase of band gap energy.110
2.4. A short overview
Nowadays, metal oxides, the perovskite oxides, graphitic carbon nitride and metal–organic frameworks are proposed as photocatalysts. Much attention in recent years has been paid to the use of MOFs in photocatalysis. However, numerous reviews on the use of these materials mainly focus on the application of metal–organic frameworks in the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, CO2 reduction, and hydrogen production.
In sections 3–5, we will summarize recent advances in photocatalytic conversion to produce value-added organic chemicals with a particular focus on research where MOFs have been used.
3. Photocatalytic oxidation reactions
Fox's group111,112 was the first to show great interest in the photocatalytic oxidation of various organic compounds. In particular, the authors showed that TiO2 was effective in the photocatalytic oxidation of primary aliphatic amines and thioethers. Later Mu et al.113 studied the oxidation of liquid cyclohexane by O2 over UV illuminated pure and doped TiO2 at room temperature. They found that the doping of TiO2 with trivalent (Ga3+ and Sr3+) and pentavalent (Sb5+ and V5+) cations was detrimental to its photocatalytic activity in cyclohexanol oxidation due to these tri- or pentavalent ions behaving as recombination centers. Since then, a variety of heterogeneous materials have been employed as photocatalysts for oxidative transformations of organic compounds including hydrocarbons and alcohols.
Nowadays, research on the oxidation of various hydrocarbons in the presence of heterogeneous photocatalysts is conducted using molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as oxidants. In our opinion, the use of H2O2 is the most promising route due to its high efficiency, environmental friendliness and very high content of active oxygen (47.1% w/w). Commercial hydrogen peroxide has been widely used in the field of chemical synthesis, e.g., epoxidation of propylene to produce propylene oxide and allyl chloride to produce epichlorohydrin, and the oxidation of amines to produce oximes and hydrocarbons to produce fatty alcohols.
3.1. Oxidation of hydrocarbons
Photocatalytic oxidative conversion of hydrocarbons is studied from two opposite aspects: decomposition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or the production of valuable oxygenated chemicals. Much effort has been devoted to the selective photocatalytic oxidation of a broad range of hydrocarbons, namely aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic.

3.1.1. Oxidation of aliphatic hydrocarbons. 
Most works, devoted to the oxidation of aliphatic hydrocarbons, are directed to their photocatalytic decomposition because they are the most abundant artificial VOCs. For example, the heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation of aliphatic hydrocarbons was first studied by Izumi et al.114 The authors described the photodecomposition of several aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-hexane, n-heptane, n-nonane, n-decane) using O2 as an oxidant and Pt/TiO2 as a catalyst. According to their conclusions, the photooxidation proceeded via a hydroxylated intermediate, namely, an alcohol. Similar experiments were conducted by Li et al.115 who used Pt/TiO2 nanocatalysts for the photodecomposition of alkanes (ethane and propane) and alkenes (ethylene and propylene). Shang et al. showed that the gas-phase photocatalytic oxidation of n-heptane over UV illuminated TiO2 led to the formation of propanal, butanal, 3-heptanone, 4-heptanone, CO and H2O.116
Highly active and selective supported rhenium catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of n-hexane and n-heptane were investigated to obtain oxygenated hydrocarbons.117 The rhenium catalysts were complexes immobilised on 3-aminopropyl-functionalised silica. Among them, the fluoro-containing complex led to the highest overall conversions of 12.6% and 10%, with selectivities of 84.9% (2-hexanol, 3-hexanol and 2-hexanone) and 96.0% (2-heptanol, 4-heptanol, 2-heptanone and 3-heptanone) for C6- and C7-alkanes, respectively. However, after the second cycle, the overall conversions of n-hexane and n-heptane decreased, confirming the loss of activity of the catalyst due to the formation of ReO species (the affinity of Re to oxygenated species is known).118
Numerous studies have been made to convert methane under photocatalytic conditions due to the application of photocatalysis emerging as an attractive technology with great potential. The low chemical reactivity and polarizability of methane, high symmetry and relatively high C—H bonding energy (440 kJ mol−1) requires a high photoenergy of up to 12.3 eV in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region to excite methane via electronic transitions in the absence of a catalyst.119 As a result, many methane reactions for the production of organic chemicals are thermodynamically unfavourable at 298 K (Table 3, entries 1, 2 and 8–10) due to the positive and large value of the Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) besides methane oxidation reactions (Table 3, entries 3–7).120 Thus, it is necessary to develop catalysts for methane conversion into value-added chemicals. Moreover, when it comes to photocatalysis, the limitation of the thermodynamic equilibrium can be exceeded due to the forward and backward reactions in photocatalytic systems requiring different photon energies to proceed.119

The pioneering works in the field of oxidative methane conversion were made by Ogura's group.121,122 They studied the oxidative photolysis of methane with water vapor at 100 °C and found a broad range of oxygenated hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture (methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid, acetone).
Nowadays, the most attractive route to methanol processing using photocatalysis is direct methane conversion into methanol (DMM, entry 8). This can be explained by the potential use of methanol as an automotive fuel. Currently, metal oxide semiconductors (Ti, W, V, Zr, Ga, etc.) are generally used in the DMM process. The mechanism of the photooxidation of methane in the presence of semiconductors (SC) has been studied in detail and is shown below: SC + hυ → h+VB + e−CB(R1) h+VB + H2Oads → HO˙ads + H+(R2) h+VB + HO−ads → HO˙ads(R3) CH4 + HO˙ads → CH3˙ + H2O(R4) CH3˙ + H2Oads → CH3OH + 0.5H2(R5)
First, the semiconductor is irradiated, and electron (e−CB) and hole (h+VB) pairs are generated (R1). The photogenerated holes can react with water and hydroxyl ions HO− adsorbed on the surface to form hydroxyl radicals HO˙ (R2) and (R3). Finally, the hydroxyl radicals formed react with methane to produce methanol (R4) and (R5).
Gondal et al.123 studied the DMM process under UV irradiation over WO3, TiO2 and NiO photocatalysts. Maximum percentage conversions of 29%, 21% and 20% were observed for WO3, TiO2 and NiO, respectively. Very recently, the superior performance of Fe supported on titanium dioxide for improved oxidation of methane to methanol at room temperature was reported.124 The authors detected that the catalyst 0.33metal wt% FeOx/TiO2 exhibited a high catalytic activity after 3 h of irradiation with a 300 W Xe lamp, with >97% selectivity towards alcohols and yields of 18 moles of methanol per mole of iron. Unfortunately, there are no data about the reusability of the catalyst.
As discussed earlier, band gap engineering is considered key for shifting the photosensitivity of semiconductor catalysts to the visible region. In this regard, the perovskite oxides (i.e., bismuth tungstate Bi2WO6 and bismuth vanadate BiVO4) have recently attracted attention from researchers of the DMM process. This fact can be explained by their relatively low band gap energies of 2.7 eV for Bi2WO6 and 2.4 eV for BiVO4. The first attempt at using such types of catalysts was to produce methanol from methane made by Murcia-López.125 They synthesised Bi2WO6, BiVO4 and coupled Bi2WO6/TiO2 (TiO2 was P25, Evonik) photocatalysts and found that the coupled photocatalyst showed higher activity due to a significant increase in CO2 formation while the CH3OH production rate was relatively stable using all catalysts synthesised. To stabilise methanol formation, Fe3+ cations were added to the reaction medium to act as an electron trapping agent and increase the hydroxyl radical concentration via Fenton and photo-Fenton processes. The main disadvantage of the perovskite-based catalyst is a very low CH4 conversion and, accordingly, methanol yield. As a rule, the conversion of methane does not exceed 10% in the presence of Bi2WO6 and BiVO4. The explanation for such low activity of the perovskite photocatalysts is the fact that the target products of oxidation reactions toward CO2 are more thermodynamically favourable than CH4 activation reactions.122,126
An original approach to enhance methanol selectivity has been recently proposed by Luo et al.,127 who investigated a 100% atom-economical DMM process over Au single atoms on black phosphorus nanosheets under light irradiation (1.2 W) at 90 °C. The authors reported that water enabled the mild oxidation of methane to methanol with >99% selectivity under the above-mentioned conditions. However, this technique did not lead to a high conversion of methane.
Therefore, it is highly relevant to design and synthesise heterogeneous photocatalysts that can selectively activate the C–H bonds of methane while suppressing complete dehydrogenation and avoiding “over-oxidation” reactions. This task can be solved by using and/or designing a new class of catalysts based on metal–organic frameworks. For example, the efficient and selective oxidation of methane can be successfully realised using Fe–O clusters on Zr6 nodes of UiO-66 modulated with trifluoroacetic acid.128 The use of this catalyst led to the extraordinarily high C1 oxygenated product yield of 4799 μmol gcat−1 h−1 with 97.9% selectivity.


3.1.2. Oxidation of alicyclic hydrocarbons. 
Cyclohexane is the most important hydrocarbon from the entire spectrum of alicyclic hydrocarbons due to the oxidation of this chemical leading to the formation of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone (Scheme 1), which are used worldwide as chemical intermediates for the production of adipic acid and caprolactam.129,130 The mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol is also known as ketone–alcohol oil (KA oil).
 Scheme 1  Formation of target products during cyclohexane oxidation. 
Several semiconductors (TiO2, ZrO2, ZnO, V2O5, SnO2, Sb2O4, CeO2, WO3) have been employed for the photocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexane.131
The mechanism of the photocatalytic oxidation of alicyclic hydrocarbons with O2 in the presence of semiconductors proceeds through the following steps:132 SC + hυ → h+VB + e−CB(R6) h+VB + C6H12 → C6H11˙ + H+(R7) C6H11˙ + O2 → C6H11OO˙(R8) C6H11OO˙ + C6H11OO˙ → C6H11OH + C6H10O + O2(R9) C6H11OO˙ + h+VB → CO2 formation(R10) O2 + e−CB → O2˙−(R11) C6H11˙ + O2˙− → C6H10O + HO−(R12) C6H10O + h+VB + O2˙− → CO2 formation(R13) C6H11OH + h+VB + O2˙− → CO2 formation(R14)
The electron and positive hole pairs are formed during the photoexcitation of a semiconductor (R6). Then, cyclohexanol is oxidised by holes with the formation of the cyclohexyl radical (R7), which reacts with molecular oxygen to produce the peroxy radical (R8). Recombination of peroxy radicals (R9) leads to the formation of the target products (cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone). During the reaction, the peroxy radical can react with h+ to generate CO2via carbon–carbon bond cleavage (R10), which is the main reason for a low selectivity of the process. Another reason is that the formed products are decomposed (R13) and (R14) due to the formation of the superoxide anion O2˙−(R11). This mechanism was proposed by Schwitzgebel et al.133 and confirmed by Shiraishi et al.,134 who investigated the photocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexane with molecular oxygen using pure and Pt nanoparticle loaded WO3 under irradiation with visible light (λ > 420 nm). The Pt/WO3 catalyst successfully promotes the partial oxidation of cyclohexane with 93% selectivity to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone due to efficient suppression of O2˙− formation. Suppression of the photocatalytic decomposition of the target products occurs via the recombination of holes and superoxide anions.
The WO3–Au composite was used for photothermal catalytic cyclohexane oxidation with dry air under solar light irradiation.135 The catalyst with 2.0 wt% gold loading exhibits significantly improved photothermal catalytic activity with a conversion of cyclohexane of 9.0% and selectivity to KA oil of 99%; these values are 1.5–2 times higher than that of commercial WO3. A similar effect had been found earlier by Mohamed,136 who used gold modified titania nanotubes in the photocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexane with H2O2.
Significant advances were made by Chinese researchers,137,138 when they reported the use of gold nanoparticles together with carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and graphitic carbon nitride for KA oil production. In particular, they disclosed a photocatalytic system in which H2O2 was produced in situ from H2O using the Au/C3N4 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm).138 After 24 h of reaction, a high conversion of cyclohexane of 10.5% was obtained with a selectivity to cyclohexanone of 100%. At the same time, the conversion of cyclohexane and selectivity to cyclohexanone were only 2.6% and 73%, respectively, in the presence of C3N4. This green photocatalytic process has great potential in industry, since water is used as a solvent without any oxidants or initiators.
Xiao et al.139 compared thermal and photothermal techniques in the oxidation of cyclohexane over graphene oxide coupled with Ag and Fe3O4 nanoparticles (GO-Ag&Fe3O4NPs).
Comparison experiments indicated that:
(1) Conversion of cyclohexane was facilitated by a temperature rise, but less than 50% of selectivity to KA oil was obtained at high temperature (140 °C); higher selectivity was achieved by photothermal catalysis under milder conditions.
(2) Ag NPs played a more important role in photocatalysis, while thermocatalysis was intensified by Fe3O4 NPs.
A novel photosensitizing decatungstate-based MOF {[Cu(NPY)2(DMF)]2(W10O32)}·DMF·3CH3CN (Fig. 2), where NPY is 3-amino-4,4′-bipyridine and DMF is N,N-dimethylformamide, was prepared and used in the photocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexane with oxygen.140 Photochemical experiments were performed with a Xe lamp (500 W) at room temperature and an O2 pressure of 101 kPa. The heterogeneous oxidation of cyclohexane proceeded very smoothly and gave 87.2% conversion and a ketone/alcohol molar ratio of 1.05 after 12 h due to the size of the photocatalyst channels being much larger (8.4 Å × 8.2 Å) than that of the substrate molecule (5.0 Å × 5.0 Å). The catalyst demonstrated excellent reusability during three photocatalytic cycles (conversion of substrate was 83.1% after the third cycle). Previous studies had also shown that the immobilised decatungstate anion W10O324− was active in the photocatalytic oxidation of cycloalkanes141 and diols.142

Xu et al.143 studied the photocatalytic activity of nitrogen-doped anatase/rutile mixed-phase TiO2 with carbonaceous species that were prepared by pyrolyzing the MIL-125(Ti) metal–organic framework (MIL stands for Material from Institute Lavoisier) with P25 composite as a precursor and subsequently doping nitrogen into the pyrolysis product using urea as a dopant in a sealed reactor. The selectivity towards cyclohexanone reached 100% when the photoreaction proceeded under irradiation from a 300 W xenon lamp (λ > 420 nm) at 25 °C and O2 pressure of 0.1 MPa for 5 h. The improved photocatalytic activities can be explained by a high visible light response, the sensitisation effect of carbonaceous species, a fast electron–hole separation efficiency as a result of dislocated bands of mixed phases and the porous structure of the catalyst.
The MIL-101(Cr) metal–organic framework was used as a precursor to prepare a series of novel C–N dual-doped Cr2O3 photocatalysts for cyclohexane oxidation using a 300 W xenon lamp (λ > 420 nm) at 25 °C and O2 pressure of 0.1 MPa for 5 h.144 It was shown that the doped carbon and nitrogen, which substituted at oxygen sites in Cr2O3, formed a new isolated narrow band above the valence band, which was responsible for the visible light sensitivity. All samples obtained facilitated cyclohexane photooxidation with molecular oxygen under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the doping of Fe(III) into the C/Cr2O3 catalyst, which can be prepared by carbonisation of MOFs, enhances the amount of photoinduced electrons and efficient electron transfer.145 As a result, the catalytic activity and selectivity for cyclohexane oxidation are dramatically increased during the photoreaction.
A semiconductor–MOF photocatalyst, NH2-MIL-125(Ti)/TiO2, with different titanium dioxide contents and a band gap of 2.7 eV, was prepared and used in cyclohexane oxidation under visible light (λ > 420 nm) at 25 °C.146 It was found that the hybrid photocatalyst, NH2-MIL-125(Ti)/TiO2, had a higher photocatalytic activity than that of the bare MOF; this can be attributed to the formation of a heterojunction structure between NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and TiO2 that can minimise recombination and prolong the lifetime of electron–hole pairs. This photocatalytic material was also stable under the experimental conditions; in particular, it still maintained a good performance even after being recycled four times. The main disadvantage of this catalyst is that it absorbs light wavelengths lower than 460 nm.
In summary, there are a lot of systems that are efficient for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane to KA oil. The doping of gold particles into photocatalysts significantly increases their activity and selectivity. Metal–organic frameworks are found to be practical at the laboratory scale. They are employed as photocatalysts and precursors for the preparation of photosensitive materials. At the same time, there are scientific and technical problems to solve, such as the low conversion of substrates and the design of reactors for efficient light transfer and utilisation.


3.1.3. Hydroxylation of aromatic hydrocarbons. 
The selective hydroxylation of benzene has attracted the greatest interest due to a number of industrial applications of phenol in the production of phenolic and epoxy resins, polycarbonates, and caprolactam.15 Currently, phenol, together with acetone, is produced by the multi-step cumene process, which suffers from several disadvantages, such as severe reaction conditions, low yield of phenol, and a great number of side products (acetophenone, 2-phenylpropan-2-ol, α-methylstyrene). Moreover, the economics of the cumene process is directly related to the acetone market, i.e., it is highly desirable to develop alternative industrial methods for the production of phenol from benzene. However, there is a challenge for one-step phenol production via catalytic or photocatalytic routes because phenol is thermodynamically easier to oxidise than benzene, resulting in the formation of carbon dioxide, hydroquinone and benzoquinone (Scheme 2).147 Therefore, in the presence of semiconductors, the main intermediate of the photooxidation reaction of benzene was phenol, which was subsequently converted into CO2via many oxidation steps. Bui et al.148 proposed two oxidation mechanisms: an oxygen transfer process using water as an oxygen source (Scheme 3) and a hole transfer process using O2 as an oxygen source (Scheme 4).

 Scheme 4  Possible mechanism for benzene photooxidation through a hole transfer process using O2 as an oxygen source. 
Nowadays, the most common oxidants used in the photocatalytic hydroxylation of benzene are molecular oxygen, H2O2, N-oxides (e.g., N2O), and N-containing heteroaromatic bases. Additionally, Fenton's reagent (Fe2+–H2O2) has been widely applied for more than 100 years. The efficiency of this oxidation system is dependent on the use of strong acids, such as HClO4, H2SO4, and CF3COOH, which are difficult to implement in industry and can lead to product separation problems and the formation of non-recyclable wastes.17 However, Chen et al.147 reported the photocatalytic oxidation of benzene under visible light in the presence of Fe-doped g-C3N4 using H2O2 as an oxidant. The authors found that the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ by photogenerated electrons occurred on the photocatalyst's surface, and then Fe2+ formed reacted with hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radicals. The photocatalytic activity of Fe–g-C3N4 can be improved by immobilisation of the photocatalyst onto SBA-15 mesoporous silica, but only 12% conversion of the substrate was achieved after 4 h over Fe–g-C3N4/SBA-15. A similar improvement was observed using CuAg@g-C3N4 as a photocatalyst.149
A hybrid material containing Fe–g-C3N4 and titanium silicate zeolite (TS-1) was prepared and employed for benzene hydroxylation under visible light using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant.150 TS-1 catalyst is known to be the most effective system for the heterogeneous liquid-phase oxidation of various organic substrates with H2O2.151 It was shown that that the hybrid catalyst possessed improved catalytic activities under visible light irradiation of about 9 times and 4 times higher than those of pure Fe–g-C3N4 and TS-1 catalysts, respectively. Under optimal conditions, up to 10% phenol yield (based on benzene) was obtained for the hybrid sample with 18% phenol selectivity (based on H2O2).
Similar to the oxidation of cyclohexane, gold nanoparticles can exert a positive influence on the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 for benzene hydroxylation.152 Although the presence of Au in TiO2 decreased the initial reaction rate, higher phenol concentrations were obtained at longer reaction times even though the yield of benzoquinone was similar in both cases. Another way to enhance the photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide is its modification with Pd and/or CeO2.153 Highly dispersed Pd/CeO2/TiO2 photocatalyst with sizes of 5–20 nm showed benzene conversion of 97% with 99% selectivity to phenol at 80 °C after 30 min using a 20 W domestic cool LED bulb as a visible light source. At the same time, without photocatalysis conditions, the Pd/CeO2/TiO2 catalyst demonstrated only 40% benzene conversion and 56% phenol selectivity.
MOF-based materials have shown significant photoactivity in the hydroxylation of benzene and other aromatics in some cases. For example, Fe-based MOFs (MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-68(Fe)) were used for benzene hydroxylation using H2O2 as an oxidant under visible light irradiation.154 It was found that MIL-100(Fe) showed more intensive absorption in the visible light region than MIL-68(Fe). This fact can be explained by the presence of µ3-O species in the MIL-100(Fe) structure that promote electron transfer from the metal center to the substrate. Previous studies155,156 on the catalytic activities for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols over a trinuclear ruthenium carboxylate, Ru3O(O2CCH3)6(H2O)3, had shown that µ3-O played an important role in its catalytic performance, since the existence of µ3-O could promote the formation of a pronounced electronic delocalised state in the Ru3O cluster, which could aid electron transfer from the metal ion to oxidant (O2) to form active species (superoxide anion).
A Cu(II)-based metal–organic framework constructed from imidazole carboxylate ligands was prepared and investigated in the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol in aqueous solution at 60 °C.157 The authors found that the photocatalytic reaction followed a Fenton-type route, allowing benzene conversion of 29% as well as a high phenol selectivity above 95% to be achieved. Recycling tests showed that there was no significant decrease after five runs, indicating good stability and reuse properties of the catalyst.
Xu et al.158 reported a new technique for the production of MIL-101(Fe) nanospheres using glycol. Using this method, nanoscale particles were obtained with a high surface area and exhibiting good photocatalytic ability for the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic reaction was conducted in a mixture of acetonitrile and water as the solvent in the presence of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. Benzene conversion reached a maximum of 35% after 24 h with selectivity of up to 98%.
A number of MOFs (UiO-66, Fe-UiO-66, UiO-66 + Fe2O3, NH2-UiO-66, MIL-53, UiO-66/MIL-53) were used as catalysts for the visible light photocatalytic oxidation of toluene in the presence of water in the reaction system.159 The Fe-UiO-66 photocatalyst was obtained by installing Fe3+ cations onto the Zr–oxo clusters of UiO-66. It was found that Fe-UiO-66, with a unique electronic structure and strong oxidizing power, exhibited visible light-driven water oxidation, which is impossible for pure UiO-66. Moreover, the holes generated over Fe-UiO-66 are able to exclusively convert H2O into hydroxide radicals, initiating activation of the C–H bond, which is necessary for reactions such as toluene oxidation. For example, the authors managed to achieve 100% conversion of the substrate with selectivities towards benzoic acid and benzaldehyde of 22% and 78%, respectively. It was concluded that the Fe-UiO-66 catalyst featured extended visible light harvesting based on metal-to-cluster charge transfer. The stability of this photocatalyst was examined by multiple characterization studies, including powder XRD, 13C NMR, SEM and ICP-AES. XRD and 13C NMR techniques showed that the ligand did not undergo hydroxylation with HO˙, and the morphology of Fe-UiO-66 was retained, which was confirmed by SEM analysis. At the same time, very little iron leaching (0.03 wt% of catalyst) was observed, which might result from the detachment of iron from the Zr6 cluster. Nevertheless, the photocatalyst was stable over at least five consecutive runs.
Zhang et al.160 investigated the photocatalytic activity of TiO2@UiO-66 composites in the oxidation of toluene to CO2. The TiO2@UiO-66 composite exhibits a higher photocatalytic activity than that of TiO2 and UiO-66 in toluene oxidation as well as rhodamine B removal from wastewater. It was proposed that O2˙− and h+ were the main active species during toluene oxidation (Fig. 3). To verify the stability of the hybrid photocatalyst, the authors used XRD and SEM analyses. It was shown that the crystalline structures of the fresh and used materials were similar after 720 min irradiation, and no apparent changes in morphology were observed before and after the reaction.

Therefore, it is essential to develop new photocatalytic systems that are able to exhibit high selectivity to phenol at high conversion of benzene. Other aromatic hydrocarbons also deserve attention from researchers with a view to produce valuable organic chemicals. A promising strategy to improve the photocatalytic activity of classical catalysts is their modification by various metals or combination with metal–organic frameworks.


3.1.4. A short overview. 
As can be seen from Table 4, a large number of photocatalytic materials have been proposed for the oxidation of hydrocarbons. However, most of them demonstrate a low conversion of substrate. We found only one example where 100% yield of a mixture of target products was achieved.159 In this case, the metal–organic framework Fe-UiO-66 was used as a photocatalyst. However, to achieve such excellent performance, it is necessary to add a sacrificial electron donor ((NH4)2Ce(NO3)6); thus, it is difficult to apply this technique on an industrial scale. Another example with a high yield of the desired product is the oxidation of benzene over the Pd/CeO2/TiO2 photocatalyst.153

As shown by many research groups, the superoxide anion O2˙− is regarded to be an efficient species for high selectivity as well as being responsible for low selectivity to the target products in the selective oxidation of alkanes. So, further investigations, using both classical semiconductors and metal–organic frameworks, in the search for active species with a milder oxidation capacity, such as singlet oxygen, should be continued.

3.2. Oxidation of alcohols
Alcohols have been widely employed as hole scavengers due to their redox potentials being less positive than the VB edge of photocatalytic metal oxides.161 As a result, the partial oxidation of primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols as well as aromatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes and/or ketones in the presence of pure and modified TiO2 photocatalysts has been extensively investigated.162–165 The main challenge is to prevent “over-oxidation” reactions, leading to the formation of carboxylic acids and/or carbon dioxide. The selectivity of the process depends on the nature of the photocatalyst, solvent, oxidant and alcohol (its structure) used.

3.2.1. Oxidation of aliphatic alcohols. 
The oxidation of primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols is important for the organic, food and pharmaceutical industries as well as for medicine and cosmetics.
The mechanism of the photocatalytic oxidation pathway using methanol as a substrate in aqueous solution was reported by Wang et al.:166 TiO2 + hυ → h+VB + e−CB(R15) h+VB + H2Oads → HO˙ads + H+(R16) h+VB + HO−ads → HO˙ads(R17) RCH2OH + HO˙ads → R˙CHOH + H2O(R18) h+VB + RCH2OH → R˙CHOH + H+(R19) R˙CHOH + O2 → RCHO + HO2˙(R20)
The authors found that, at a critical molar ratio of water/methanol of ca. 300, water was the dominant species on the surface. In this case, the photooxidation of methanol proceeds through hydroxyl radicals formed through reactions (R16) and (R18). Reactions (R19) and (R20) refer to the direct oxidation of methanol by photogenerated holes when the water/methanol molar ratio is lower than 300.
Molinari et al.167 studied the TiO2 photocatalytic conversion of allylic (geraniol, citronellol, trans-2-penten-1-ol) and primary (1-pentanol) alcohols under UV irradiation. Good selectivities (>70%) were achieved at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using O2 as an oxidant and CH3CN as a solvent. It was found that effective alcohol adsorption on the TiO2 surface was a vital requirement for efficient photooxidation. The following important aspects were also demonstrated to have a significant effect on the photocatalytic performances:
(1) adding water to acetonitrile increases the polarity of the medium and, consequently, favours the removal of polar alcohols from the surface;
(2) adding water hinders alcohol interactions with the photoactive surface due to H2O adsorption on the surface;
(3) longer alcohol chains (geraniol and citronellol) are more susceptible to the water inhibiting effect than their shorter analogues (trans-2-penten-1-ol and 1-pentanol).
It should be noted that the use of acetonitrile in most cases is favourable for obtaining a high yield of aldehyde or ketone over TiO2 photocatalyst due to a so-called “shield effect”.168 What is even more interesting is that this effect is observed not only in the photooxidation of alcohols, but also in the epoxidation of olefins with molecular oxygen.169
Besides the TiO2-based photocatalysts, other photocatalysts are proposed for the oxidation of aliphatic alcohols, namely, CuO/CuZnAl hydrotalcite–ZnO,170 mixed-valence vanadium oxide,171 Au–Pd alloy nanoparticles on a phosphate-modified hydrotalcite support,172 and bismuth oxyhalide BiOCl.173 For example, up to 90% conversion of aliphatic alcohols (1-pentanol, 1-hexanol and 1-heptanol) and 100% selectivity to the corresponding aldehydes was achieved at room temperature by Xie et al. over a BiOCl photocatalyst with a band gap of 2.88 eV.173 This work provides a new approach for the selective oxidation of aliphatic alcohols and can trigger more enthusiasm for this process.
However, the main attention from researchers is focused on the photooxidation of benzyl alcohol. This process is discussed in the following sub-section.


3.2.2. Oxidation of benzyl alcohol. 
The selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is a fundamental process in organic conversion for academic research.174 Benzaldehyde is widely used by the chemical industry in the preparation of various aniline dyes, perfumes, flavorings and pharmaceuticals. Mandelic acid, which is used as an antibacterial, is produced via the addition of hydrocyanic acid to benzaldehyde. Nowadays, the production of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol is performed under harsh reaction conditions, such as high temperatures, high pressures, and excess inorganic/organic oxidants. Thus, it is highly important to develop a new efficient eco-friendly oxidation to produce benzaldehyde under mild conditions.
The investigation of Palmisano et al.162 was one of the first attempts to oxidize benzylic compounds under photocatalytic conditions. The authors employed a homemade titanium dioxide photocatalyst and found that the yield of p-anisaldehyde did not exceed 42% with a quantum efficiency of 0.116% under near-UV irradiation at room temperature. The relatively poor yield of the target product in this case can be explained by the valence band of TiO2 having a high oxidative potential (2.7 V). At the same time, parallel experiments when the Au–Pd/TiO2 catalyst was used without any irradiation showed that the achieved conversion and selectivity were 74.5% and 91.6%, respectively (100 °C, 8 h, 0.2 MPa O2).175 Interesting results were obtained by the group of Niaraki.176 In this investigation, nitromethane was used for the first time as an electron acceptor for the highly chemoselective oxidation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of a TiO2 photocatalyst under 400 nm LED irradiation. These studies proved that the development of new catalysts and/or photocatalysts for the selective oxidation of benzylic compounds had significant prospects. Since then, a huge number of photocatalysts have been proposed, including CQDs,177,178 pure and doped g-C3N4,179,180 ternary chalcogenide compounds such as ZnIn2S4,181 Bi-based semiconductors,182,183 and CdS.184 Most of the above-mentioned photocatalysts have a relatively mild oxidation capacity and show much higher selectivity towards the target products compared with the Ti-based catalytic systems. For example, Li et al.177 reported that carbon quantum dots were an effective NIR-light photocatalyst for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with high conversion (92%) and selectivity (100%) using 30% H2O2 as an oxidant. It was also proposed that two potential oxidation mechanisms could lead to the formation of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol and benzoic acid from benzaldehyde. With regard to the formation of benzaldehyde (Scheme 5a), hydroxyl radicals obtained from H2O2 decomposition lead to the radical through oxidative dehydrogenation and can then oxidize to the target product. Benzoic acid forms during the oxidative dehydrogenation of benzaldehyde under HO˙ catalysis conditions (Scheme 5b).

It was reported that Au-modified BiOCl could photocatalyse benzyl alcohol oxidation with O2 under visible light through the synergistic action of plasmonic hot electrons and holes (Fig. 4a).183 It was considered that oxygen on BiOCl enhanced O2 adsorption and facilitated O2˙− formation through the provision of plasmonic hot electrons. The authors showed that the yield of benzaldehyde was 76% after 8 h with 0.1 MPa O2 and proposed a mechanism for this reaction (Fig. 4b) that started with the adsorption of benzyl alcohol onto the Au–BiOCl surface.

MOFs are also actively investigated in the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Recently, a series of mixed-linker zirconium-based UiO-66 metal–organic frameworks were employed as visible light photocatalysts in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol.185 These catalysts contain 2-amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate as a primary linker and 2-X-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (X = H, F, Cl and Br) as a secondary linker. Among the catalysts examined, NH2-UiO-66, NH2-UiO-66-F, NH2-UiO-66-Cl and NH2-UiO-66-Br showed 18.4%, 53.9%, 38.2% and 43.4% conversions of benzyl alcohol, if all other factors were equal. This study showed that the partial replacement of benzenedicarboxylate (BDC) linkers by halogens enhanced the MOF photocatalytic activity significantly due to stabilisation of the superoxide radical anion on Zr3+ connected to the halogenated linkers, decreasing the recombination rate of the photogenerated electrons and holes. The Zr-based MOF photocatalyst NH2-UiO-66 was also capable of oxidizing benzyl bromide to benzaldehyde with high selectivity (about 80%) and conversion (up to 99%) in the presence of oxygen and DMF as a solvent under visible light irradiation (26 W helical bulb).186 However, the selectivity of NH2-UiO-66 after the second and third cycles slightly decreased, which could be attributed to some degree of blockage in the micropores of the photocatalyst. These conclusions were confirmed by analysis of the BET surface area, which indicated that it was reduced from 997.714 to 302.138 m2 g−1 and some microporous properties were lost after three runs. Similar investigations were made by Qiu et al.,187 who used a series of Ce-based UiO MOF photocatalysts (Ce-H-UiO-66, Ce-NO2-UiO-66, Ce-NH2-UiO-66, Ce-Br-UiO-66, and Ce-UiO-67). Among all these catalysts, Ce-H-UiO-66, Ce-NO2-UiO-66, and Ce-Br-UiO-66 exhibited good conversions of 99.0%, 49.0% and 70.1%, respectively. The photocatalytic activity was well maintained after three cycles, as no appreciable loss of catalytic activity or selectivity was observed. The authors also estimated the band gap values of Ce-H-UiO-66 (2.82 eV), Ce-NO2-UiO-66 (2.79 eV), Ce-NH2-UiO-66 (2.09 eV), Ce-Br-UiO-66 (2.68 eV), and Ce-UiO-67 (2.50 eV).
A novel composite containing Eu-based MOF and graphene oxide (GO) was used as a photocatalyst for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol using water as an oxygen source.188 It was shown that the MOF–GO composite exhibited a better photocatalytic activity than that of the bare MOF because GO could efficiently inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. This work has a great practical importance, showing a new green route to enhance the photocatalytic activity of catalysts in oxidation reactions. Another interesting method to improve the performances of metal–organic frameworks in various practically important photoreactions is their “decoration” with a classical semiconductor (CdS).189 This investigation demonstrated a strategy for the integration of photocatalytic H2 production coupled with the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol over the CdS/MIL-53(Fe) photocatalyst under visible light (λ > 420 nm). The photocatalytic activity of the synthesised composite far exceeded that of the single components of CdS and MOF; this can be explained because the Z-scheme composite has faster charge transfer and inhibits the recombination of photogenerated charges. It should be noted that MOF-based materials also enable the production of H2O2 to be coupled with benzaldehyde.190,191
A porphyrinic chromium-based MOF, Cr-PCN-600 (PCN stands for porous coordination network), photocatalyst was synthesised and examined in the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol under visible light irradiation.192 The resulting Cr-MOF exhibits a high surface area, permanent porosity and broad light absorption wavelength range as well as photocatalytic activity (99% yield of benzaldehyde), which is attributed to the presence of the tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin linkers as photosensitizers. Moreover, the photocatalyst was reused three times without losing its activity and structural integrity, which could be related to the robust structure of the MOF.
A facile and novel seed growth method to coat NH2-MIL-125 MOFs with crystalline and porous covalent organic framework (COF) materials and form a range of nanocomposites with different thicknesses of COF shell was developed (Fig. 5) for the production of benzaldehyde from benzyl alcohol.193 The hybrid nanomaterial, which has potential in future green organic synthesis, showed the highest yield (94.7%) of benzaldehyde, which was approximately 2.5 and 15.5 times those of bare NH2-MIL-125 and COF, respectively. The promoted photocatalytic performance of the hybrid photocatalyst can be explained by enhanced photoinduced charge carrier transfer between the MOF and COF through the covalent bond. Moreover, the NH2-MIL-125@COF hybrid still retained a relatively high catalytic activity after 5 cycles under the same reaction conditions.

The incorporation of Au194 or Pd195 particles into the MOF structures may be a simple way to improve their photocatalytic characteristics in oxidative reactions. The Pd/NH2-MIL-125 photocatalyst demonstrated excellent activity and selectivity (>99%) for the oxidative coupling of benzylamine.195 The highest benzylamine conversion of 94% was achieved in the presence of this catalyst after 3 h, corresponding to a conversion rate of 3136 μmol h−1 gcat−1, which was about 1.37 times that of pristine NH2-MIL-125. However, upon further increasing the Pd loading amount, a decreasing benzylamine conversion (62%) was exhibited due to excess Pd leading to the formation of larger metal nanocrystals, which blocked the structural pores of NH2-MIL-125 and reduced the amount of efficient active sites.


3.2.3. A short overview. 
Although a great number of photocatalysts (classical semiconductors, MOFs, etc.) with high conversion and selectivity have been proposed for the oxidation of alcohols under visible light irradiation (Table 5), the low reaction rates remain an issue for achieving the large-scale production of aldehydes/ketones. In most cases, the substrate content in the reaction medium does not exceed 1 mmol in a high volume of solvent. Moreover, it is necessary to avoid the presence of nonselective oxidation species, such as HO˙, which lead to “over-oxidation”. However, there have already been successful attempts to enhance the photocatalytic properties of various well-known materials; this shows the great potential of this green method for the production of carbonyl compounds via alcohol oxidation. These achievements are encouraging and it is hoped that a new industrial process for obtaining oxygenated compounds will be developed in the near future.

4. Photocatalytic reduction reactions
Nowadays, the most important photocatalytic reduction reactions, which can achieve industrial application, are the reduction of carbon dioxide and nitroaromatic compounds.
4.1. Reduction of carbon dioxide
Carbon dioxide contributes largely to global climate change because it is one of the main greenhouse gases that is present in the Earth's atmosphere.50 The latest measurements released by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (UC San Diego) have shown that atmospheric CO2 concentrations are now at record levels. The CO2 level for April 2021 reached 419 ppm, which was 50% higher than the average for 1750–1800.201 Moreover, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted that the atmospheric CO2 concentration could reach up to 590 ppm by 2100, and the global mean temperature would rise by 1.9 °C.202 This could cause horrific changes to the planet, such as ice melting at the Earth's poles, rapidly rising sea levels, and increasing precipitation across the globe.203 There are already documents that are aimed at improving the CO2 concentration situation, i.e., it can be argued that humanity is thinking about the environment, sustainable development and the future of its descendants. One of these documents is the Paris Agreement,204 the long-term temperature goal of which is to keep the rise in global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 °C, recognizing that this would substantially reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. This aim should be done by directly reducing emissions as soon as possible.205 However, there are at least two additional routes to reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, including CO2 capture and storage (CCS) and CO2 utilisation to produce value-added chemicals. The capacity of CCS technologies is limited by the energy requirement for gas compression and transportation and environmental risk of CO2 leakage. Therefore, research and industrial activities have been directed towards the conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals using thermochemical, biological, electrochemical or photocatalytic methods.206
Currently, some large companies have announced the construction of plants where CO2 will be the feedstock for the production of chemicals. In particular, Perstorp, a global leader in the specialty chemicals market, has developed a concept to produce methanol from a large variety of recovered end-of-life streams and hydrogen from electrolysis.207 The company plans to reduce carbon emission by 500000 tons annually by producing sustainable methanol. Inovyn has announced a “power to methanol” project in Antwerp, Belgium, which will produce methanol from captured CO2 combined with hydrogen that is generated from renewable electricity.208 This project would produce 8000 tons annually of sustainable methanol and would save at least 8000 tons of CO2 emissions every year.
One of the most promising ways to utilise CO2 is its photocatalytic conversion using solar energy (Table 6).37,209 Interest in this topic increased dramatically after several publications demonstrated the photoelectrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to organic compounds in the 1970s.210 Since then, a large number of various photocatalysts have been described for CO2 reduction, including TiO2,211 Bi2MoO6,212 g-C3N4,213 and metal–organic frameworks.214–216 The main products which can be produced by CO2 photoreduction are methanol, formic acid, methane, and ethane.

Similar to the oxidation of hydrocarbons and alcohols, there are many strategies for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of various materials in this process, such as:
(1) doping with metals (Pt, Cu, Cr, Ru, Pd, Ag, Fe, Co, and Ni);52
(2) combining different materials to improve their properties (band gap, electron densities, and stability), for example, CeO2/Bi2MoO6;217
(3) introducing defects: defects on surfaces can improve photocatalytic activity, as oxygen vacancies act as electron traps.218
We suppose that there is no reason to describe in detail recent advances in the photoreduction of CO2 because many excellent and relevant reviews have been published recently.12,13,219–221 Furthermore, the use of MOF materials in photocatalytic CO2 reduction (Fig. 6) has been carefully reviewed (see Table 2). We consider it is necessary only to outline the main advantages and disadvantages of MOFs as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Compared with conventional semiconductor photocatalysts, metal–organic frameworks have the following advantages:
(1) MOF-based photocatalysts are characterised by an ultrahigh CO2 adsorption capacity due to their intrinsic porosity;
(2) the catalytic active sites in MOFs can be designed and adjusted rationally;
(3) a wide spectrum of novel MOF photocatalysts can be synthesised, since there are a variety of metal clusters and organic linkers;
(4) the synthesis conditions are mild and simple in most cases.

However, there are some disadvantages that limit the use of these materials on an industrial scale:
(1) the yield of the target products is still rather low, indicating that further efforts are needed to make a great breakthrough;
(2) it is necessary to add a sacrificial agent or electron donor (e.g., tertiary amines) to the reaction medium, which is not economical, technological and eco-friendly.
4.2. Reduction of nitroaromatics
The reduction of nitroaromatic compounds is one of the most important straightforward protocols for amine synthesis. Aromatic amines play a key role in the chemical industries, since they are essential ingredients for the fabrication of pigments, pesticides, dyes, plastics, and pharmaceuticals.222
Aniline is the most important compound among aminoarenes. This chemical is widely used as a raw material to produce textile dyes, such as indigo and induline, as well as pharmaceutical drugs, such as acetaminophen, sulfadiazine, and sulfapyridine. However, the most important use of aniline is in the synthesis of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, which is the precursor of polyurethane foams.223 The global aniline market was estimated to be USD 8.8 billion in 2019 and its demand will likely grow up to USD 14.5 billion in 2027 with a CAGR of 6.4%.224
Nowadays, aniline is obtained in industry through a multi-step process, which includes the production of nitric acid, nitration of benzene with HNO3/H2SO4 mixture, and the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene with metal catalysts (RANEY® Ni or Pt/Pd on carbon).225 This conventional method is characterised by several disadvantages, such as energy intensiveness, feedstock and capital cost concerns, corrosiveness, formation of non-recyclable wastes (acid and phenolic side products), and as a result, environmental issues. Thus, it is extremely necessary to develop a new eco-friendly process, which will follow the greening trends of global chemical manufacturing practice. According to the Principles of Green Chemistry, the design of chemical syntheses should focus on preventing waste, leaving no waste to treat or clean-up.2,226
Photocatalysis can not only help to solve environmental problems associated with the production of aniline, providing the reduction step under mild conditions, but also is able to cope with the effective removal of nitrophenols from aqueous media. These compounds have been listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a priority pollutant because they are toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, and anthropogenic owing to the presence of the nitro group.227 Nowadays, approximately 65000 nitroaromatic pollutants are generated from different chemical industries and/or sources.
Applications of heterogeneous photocatalysis for the reduction of nitroaromatic compounds to the corresponding amines have been widely studied using a variety of semiconductors, such as TiO2,228 N-doped TiO2,229 Ru(II) complex immobilised onto ZnO hybrid in the presence of a Pt(II) co-catalyst,230 and g-C3N4.231 In particular, it was shown that commercial titanium dioxide could be potentially utilised as an efficient photocatalyst for the reduction of m-dinitrobenzene with 100% yield of m-phenylenediamine after 4 h under UV irradiation.228
Safari and Kazemi232 demonstrated that a nanosized CdS photocatalyst was an active photocatalyst in the reduction of nitrobenzene. The yield of aniline was 91% and 89% under 4 W blue LED and sunlight irradiation (80–100 × 103 lux), respectively. It was also shown that nitroaromatics containing electron withdrawing groups (–CN, –NO2, –COR) provided high yields in short reaction times compared with those with electron-rich substituents (–Me, –NH2). At the same time, the photocatalytic activity of the CdS catalyst can be improved by its modification with reduced graphene oxide.233 Although this method leads to an improvement in the photocatalytic characteristics of CdS, it does not solve the problem of the use of large amounts of hazardous auxiliary solvent (benzotrifluoride). Graphene oxide also exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance when a classical perovskite BiVO4 is grafted onto its surface.234 rGO loaded with 10% BiVO4 resulted in 100% yield of aniline and other aromatic amines under visible light irradiation at room temperature. The main problem associated with this photoreductive protocol is that hydrazine monohydrate is used as a sacrificial agent to provide electrons and protons. The authors proposed the mechanism for the visible light-assisted photoreduction of nitrobenzene to aniline (Fig. 7). Firstly, electron–hole pairs in BiVO4 are generated by visible light, and the photoexcited electrons are transferred to the CB of rGO. The photogenerated electrons have excellent mobility due to the conjugated π–π system of graphene oxide. Hydrazine monohydrate is simultaneously oxidised by the VB holes generated in nearby BiVO4 and rGO. Then, using the GC-MS technique it was proved to be the direct route for the production of aniline via the formation of N-phenylhydroxylamine and nitrosobenzene intermediates. The reaction pathway through the formation of N-phenylhydroxylamine and nitrosobenzene was also observed by Aljahdali et al.,235 who used Gd–CoSeO3 nanocomposites for the photocatalytic reduction of nitrobenzene. In this case, the photocatalytic performances of the perovskite are improved by doping with Gd3+ cations, which enhance the stability of electrons and holes, avoiding speedy recombination and increasing the efficiency of electrons beside the resultant H˙ as photocatalyst species. Doping of a perovskite photocatalyst with Ag is also effective in this reduction process.236

Recently, MOFs have been evaluated as promising materials for the adsorption, catalytic conversion, and sensing of nitroaromatic compounds, since they have an excellent adsorption capacity towards nitroaromatic compounds.237
Deenadayalan et al.238 proposed a novel microporous Ni(II)–porphyrin-based 3D supramolecular MOF for visible light-assisted photocatalytic reduction of nitroaromatics using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as a mild reducing agent. This MOF demonstrated remarkable photocatalytic activity in the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline (100% yield after 1.5 h) that could be attributed to its 3D supramolecular structure constituted by the close stacking and organised arrangement of 2D layers due to π–π interactions, resulting in a cooperative redox reaction between the porphyrin and the Ni(II)–oxo connecting node.
As we have described above, the UiO-66 family of MOFs serve as photocatalysts with applications that range from the oxidation of organic molecules to CO2 reduction. Theoretical studies have indicated that initial light absorption excites an electron from the highest occupied crystal orbital (HOCO) to the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO), both of which primarily reside on the linkers of UiO-66 MOFs.239,240 At the same time, changing the metal identity also impacts on photocatalysis, primarily by altering the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) energy. Thus, it is necessary to study the effect of both linker and metal on photocatalytic processes. One of the attempts to check the theoretical explanations was the study of Elkin and Saouma,241 who synthesised the Zr and Hf analogues of M-UiO-66-NH2, M-UiO-66-Py, and M-UiO-66, and then utilised them in the photocatalytic reduction of nitrobenzene. It was demonstrated that the linker impacts on photocatalysis with the following order Py > NH2 > H, and the reactivity depends on the metal nature (Hf-based MOFs have superior activity to their Zr-analogues).
Abdelhameed and El-Shahat242 prepared a novel ZIF-67@NH2-MIL-125 nanocomposite with a band gap of 1.79 via an in situ modification technique. This photocatalyst was obtained using a Ti-based MOF (NH2-MIL-125) as a precursor with subsequent modification by the zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67). The resulting nanocomposite showed good photocatalytic activity in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol under visible light irradiation, but the exact structure of ZIF-67@NH2-MIL-125 remains unknown. However, this photocatalyst exhibited comparative stability after four cycles, providing no remarkable loss in activity. Another zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) was used to construct a visible light responsive catalyst, Pd/MoO3−x@ZIF-8, for nitrobenzene reduction.243 The authors observed that there was no product over MoO3−x@ZIF-8, ZIF-8, and MoO3−x photocatalysts, indicating that Pd nanoparticles were necessary to catalyze the reduction reaction. At the same time, under dark conditions, Pd-containing photocatalysts Pd/MoO3−x@ZIF-8, Pd/ZIF-8, and Pd/MoO3−x exhibited similar activity, but a significant enhancement of activity was achieved on Pd/MoO3−x@ZIF-8 under visible light irradiation. This effect is attributed to the cooperativeness between MoO3−x@ZIF-8 with a core–shell structure and Pd nanoparticles in steering electron flow transferred from MoO3−x to Pd nanoparticles. As a result, fast separation and transfer of plasmon-induced electrons were achieved. Also, a classical NH2-MIL-125 framework can be modified by various methods to improve its photocatalytic activity in the reduction of nitroaromatics. For example, it was reported that NH2-MIL-125 could be incorporated into cellulose acetate (CA) film with additional doping with metals (Ag and Pd).244 The calculated band gaps for the synthesised photocatalysts are 2.53 eV, 2.38 eV, and 1.99 eV for NH2-MIL-125@CA, Ag@NH2-MIL-125@CA, and Pd@NH2-MIL-125@CA, respectively. The films containing noble metals showed significantly higher photocatalytic reduction under visible light irradiation (conversion was about 95%) compared with NH2-MIL-125@CA film due to their lower band gaps. Despite the advantages of these photocatalysts (high efficiency, recyclability), their synthesis method is characterised by complexity and difficulty of application in industrial practice. Another example, where doping of MOF-based photocatalysts with noble metals (Pd) led to enhancement of their activity, was shown by Chen et al.245
The integration of a MOF and a COF has also potential as an interesting topic for research devoted to the photocatalytic reduction of nitroaromatics.246,247 A core–shell MOF@COF nanocomposite obtained by the covalent linking of a chemically stable COF on the surface of size-selective NH2-UiO-66 was modified by Pd nanoclusters with an average diameter of ∼0.8 nm and then used as a catalyst for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene (Fig. 8).246 This material demonstrated superior catalytic performance and excellent recyclability that should be attributed to the synergies among the three components of the NH2-UiO-66@COF@Pd catalyst: (i) the limited growth of Pd nanoclusters by NH2-UiO-66@COF, which enhances the utilisation of Pd active sites; (ii) the stabilisation and prevention of metal leaching of Pd active sites by the COF shell structure; (iii) the efficient mass transfer effect of the hierarchical porous NH2-UiO-66@COF support.

4.3. A short overview
A large number of different materials have been investigated in the photocatalytic reduction of nitroaromatics (Table 7). Most of them have superior photocatalytic activity in the reduction of nitroaromatics. However, there are some disadvantages, which limit the industrial application of developed photocatalysts:
(1) in all cases, a high amount of solvent is used;
(2) it is necessary to use a hole scavenger (e.g., Na2SO3) or special additives (e.g., KI) to increase the photoreaction rate.

The use of MOFs in this reaction is a promising route, since their photocatalytic performances are not inferior to those of classical semiconductors. The 3D framework of these materials, with its high porosity and excellent adsorption capacity towards nitroaromatics, provides a suitable surface for photoreduction reactions.
5. Conversion of biomass
The use of biomass in the chemical industry for producing value-added products is recommended because this route complies totally with the following principle of green chemistry: “a raw material or feedstock should be renewable rather than depleting whenever technically and economically practicable”.2
About 200 billion tons of biomass are produced annually in the world,255 among which the two largest fractions are carbohydrates and lignin. The composition of biomass depends on the type of plant and includes triglycerides (fats and oils), proteins, and terpenes.256
Nowadays, only a small part of produced biomass is used in heavy organic synthesis.18 Recent research on photocatalytic conversion has focused on non-edible biomass or biomass from waste streams as feedstocks, since there is controversy about the use of edible biomass as a raw material. This approach seems to be sustainable because competition with food will not exist in the future if efficient industrial photocatalytic processes are created.
5.1. Lignocellulosic biomass
Lignocellulosic biomass consists of three major polymeric components (Fig. 9):257 lignin (20–30%), cellulose (35–50%), and hemicellulose (20–30%). Lignocellulose has a significant advantage over first-generation renewable feedstocks (sugars, starch, and vegetable oils), as it is non-edible and, subsequently, does not compete with food. The conventional usage of lignocellulose is in the pulp and paper industries. Nowadays, lignocellulosic biomass is considered as the most abundant feedstock for the production of biofuels, mainly bioethanol.258 At the same time, the aromatic moieties of lignin are potentially valuable building blocks for high-value aromatic compounds (guaiacol, vanillin, ethyl benzene, benzoic acid, acetovanillone, syringaldehyde, etc.).

5.1.1. Lignin. 
Lignin is a biopolymer derived from a handful of phenyl propane lignols that crosslink in diverse ways. These lignols are of three main types (Scheme 6): p-coumaryl alcohol (H), coniferyl alcohol (G), and sinapyl alcohol (S).259 The content of lignin and crosslinking units in it strongly vary between plant sources:260
(1) in softwood conifers, lignin represents 25–40% of the dry weight of the plant; softwoods are rich in G units;
(2) the lignin content in hardwoods is 18–25%; hardwoods are rich in G and S units;
(3) grasses and agricultural crops contain 10–20% of lignin; grasses are rich in G and S units, the content of H units can reach 10–25%.
 Scheme 6  Structures of monolignols: S – sinapyl alcohol; H – p-coumaryl alcohol; G – coniferyl alcohol. 
Monolignols in lignin are predominantly linked by either ether or C–C bonds. To categorise the various types of linkages between two lignols, the carbon atoms in the aliphatic side chains of the monolignols are labelled as α, β, and γ and those in the aromatic moieties are numbered 1–6 (Scheme 6). There are three major linkages between the structural units of lignin: β-aryl ether (β-O-4), resinol (β–β), and phenylcoumaran (β-5). Other linkages include α-aryl ether (α-O-4), diaryl ether (4-O-5), aliphatic ether (α-O-γ), spirodienone (β-1), etc. All of the above linkages are represented in Scheme 7.
 Scheme 7  Typical linkages in the lignin molecule. 
The utilisation of lignin, as well as cellulosic biomass, as a raw material for valuable organic chemicals using photocatalytic conditions has been recently reviewed by Granone et al.,18 Rao et al.,259 Li et al.,260 Liu et al.,261 Xiang et al.,262 and de Assis et al.263 These excellent and comprehensive works describe in detail many strategies and approaches employed for photocatalytic lignin transformation. Thus, we outline in this review some basic principles of lignin conversion and try to highlight the main challenges.
It is well known that the photocatalytic conversion of lignin usually involves the depolymerisation of macromolecules, and/or the transformation of lignin functional groups. Because β-O-4 is the most frequent linkage in lignin (40–65% of the total inter-aromatic linkages), most photocatalytic processes for the depolymerisation of lignin to produce aromatic monomers are focused on efficient cleavage of these linkages.264 It should be noted that the reactivity of the lignin macromolecule depends significantly on the presence of various functional groups: carboxyl and carbonyl, methoxy, benzyl alcohol, phenolic and aliphatic hydroxyl, noncyclic benzyl ether groups, etc. Three pathways for the photocatalytic cleavage of C–O bonds in β-O-4 linkages are well studied: (i) the redox-neutral cleavage strategy, which is initiated by holes/oxidative species combined with electrons;265 (ii) oxidative cleavage triggered by holes or oxidative species;266 (iii) reductive cleavage promoted by electrons or reducing agents.267 The main challenge is the high energies of the major linkages: α-O-4 (∼218 kJ mol−1), β-O-4 (∼289 kJ mol−1), and 4-O-5 (∼314 kJ mol−1). A promising approach for boosting the lignin depolymerisation rate to yield aromatics is the activation of lignin by selective oxidation.268 The activation method significantly reduces the linkage dissociation energy (e.g., from 289 to 234 kJ mol−1 for β-O-4), and photocatalysis could “assist” to improve the depolymerisation of lignin.


5.1.2. Cellulose. 
Cellulose and hemicellulose are both polysaccharides that serve as the structural components of the plant cell wall and constitute over 60% of lignocellulosic biomass, which makes them an abundant renewable carbon source for the sustainable production of valuable organic chemicals. Depolymerisation of these materials with subsequent transformations of the formed C5 and C6 sugars (oxidation, reduction, C–C cleavage, etc.) can lead to various oxygenates as end products (Scheme 8).
 Scheme 8  Photocatalytic conversion of cellulose and hemicellulose. 
One of the most popular methods to depolymerise cellulosic biomass into valuable chemicals is acid hydrolysis. However, cellulose is stable because of its crystalline structure and insoluble in most solvents. Therefore, this process should be carried out at relatively high temperatures (>150 °C) using homogeneous mineral acid or solid acids as a catalyst, which leads to a low yield of target products due to the formation of by-products, in particular, humins.269 The use of homogeneous acids is also accompanied by reactor corrosion, which limits the application of this method in industry.
Photocatalysis driven cellulose depolymerisation offers an alternative method under milder conditions. In the photocatalytic conversion of biomass (including cellulose), efforts of researchers are primarily focused on redox reactions, in which the photoexcited charge carriers or photogenerated reactive species are used as reductants or oxidants.270 Recent studies have shown that the localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect has the opportunity to drive the non-redox reaction.271,272 The main advantage of the LSPR-driven reactions is that the activity and selectivity can be efficiently manipulated by varying the intensity and wavelength of light.
It should be noted that an interesting approach to utilise cellulosic biomass is the production of hydrogen273–275 and subsequent conversion of the first hydrolysis products (glucose, xylose, furfural hydroxymethylfurfural) into valuable oxygenates.276,277

5.2. Triglycerides
Triglycerides are the main components of vegetable oils, which are the one of the most promising, cheapest and available types of renewable sources. Triglycerides are composed of three fatty acids joined at a glycerol juncture.226,278 The most common vegetable oils are composed of fatty acids that vary from 14 to 22 carbons in length with 0 to 3 double bonds per fatty acid (Table 8). It is now common to distinguish between edible (sunflower, palm, rapeseed, soybean, coconut, etc.) and non-edible (karanja, jatropha, neem, castor, etc.) vegetable oils. With a global production of more than 200 million tons per year, approximately 80% of vegetable oils are utilised for food.

However, an incredible number of articles on the transesterification of vegetable oils with methanol in the presence of alkalis have been published since the 2000s. The transesterification of vegetable oils leads to the formation of the following important products: fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs, biodiesel) and glycerol (Scheme 9). Biodiesel is considered as a renewable fuel and has shown acceptable results in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.279
 Scheme 9  Production of biodiesel and glycerol from vegetable oils. 
According to the European Academies Science Advisory Council, biodiesel is categorised into four types based on the feedstock used.280,281 First-generation biodiesel is produced from edible oils, while the second generation has shifted to non-edible feedstocks, and third-generation biodiesel includes the use of microalgae and waste oils as raw materials. Photobiological solar fuels and electrofuels are considered as the fourth-generation of biodiesel.
It should be noted that FAMEs generated during the transesterification reaction can be potentially used as a starting material for obtaining various products, namely, (i) epoxidized FAMEs used as polyvinyl chloride stabilizers and plasticizers;282 (ii) fatty alcohols used in the production of detergents, surfactants, viscosity index improvers, and pour point depressants;283 (iii) fatty acid alkanolamides used as surfactants, lubricants, and corrosion inhibitors.284
A co-product of biodiesel production, glycerol, is formed in an amount of about 10% by weight of the FAME mixture weight. This chemical has great potential in the chemical industry as a raw material for the production of high value-added products: acrolein, acrylic acid, propanediol, glycerol carbonate, lactic acid, dihydroxyacetone, epichlorohydrin, etc. (Scheme 10). The optimisation of these processes and the development of glycerol valorisation would significantly improve profits of the biodiesel industry.
 Scheme 10  Glycerol as a new platform for sustainable production. 
The main disadvantage of bioglycerol derived from vegetable oils is that a high free fatty acid content prevents its extensive use and necessitates purification. However, recent studies have shown that employing bifunctional catalysts to produce glycerol with high purity and using non-edible feedstocks or microalgae can overcome this disadvantage.285

5.2.1. Photocatalytic production of biodiesel. 
As mentioned above, the most common way to synthesize biodiesel is through the alkali catalysed homogeneous transesterification of oils. However, this reaction is very sensitive to the purity of the reactants: the presence of free fatty acids (FFAs) can lead to soap formation and lower the yield of biodiesel. Moreover, the use of homogeneous catalysts causes the formation of large amounts of waste and leads to high costs for the isolation and purification of FAMEs and glycerol.286 Corro et al.287 developed a new heterogeneous catalyst (ZnO/SiO2) for the photocatalytic esterification of FFAs present in jatropha oil with methanol under UV irradiation followed by transesterification of triglycerides using conventional NaOH. This strategy allows one to obtain a better-quality biodiesel that meets international standards. The photocatalytic esterification of FFAs proceeds through the formation of R–COOH˙ and CH3O˙ radicals formed by the reaction of FFAs with photogenerated electrons and methanol with photogenerated holes, respectively. The generated radicals subsequently react to form the final products. However, even though ZnO/SiO2 exhibited a high FFA esterification activity, it was ineffective under visible light. To overcome this disadvantage, Corro's group investigated the activity of the Cr/SiO2 photocatalyst in biodiesel production under solar irradiation.288 The authors proved the synergetic electronic interaction between Cr6+ and Cr3+ cations, which could absorb photons of different energy ranges and generate electron–hole pairs at distinct sites.
Other important results were obtained by Manique et al.,289 who studied the photoactivity of TiO2 nanotubes in the esterification of oleic acid in biodiesel production. Despite the high yield of methyl oleate (86%), this photocatalyst is effective only under UV conditions due to its large band gap (3.08 eV). Doping of the TiO2 photocatalyst with N and S leads to a significant enhancement of its activity in FFA esterification with methanol under visible light under ambient conditions.290 The efficiency of this photocatalyst in the visible region can be explained by the lower band gap compared with that of pure TiO2 and the recombination of excitons. Most interestingly, the subsequent modification of N,S-doped TiO2 by Au nanoparticles does not affect the formation rate of FAMEs because the proximity of methanol allows it to adsorb on the Au surface, and this adsorption increases in the presence of high energy facets, leading to limitations in the availability of methanol for esterification. Another method to improve TiO2 esterification activity under visible light irradiation was proposed by Guo et al.291 They prepared a La3+/ZnO–TiO2 photocatalyst and found that the conversion of FFAs in photocatalytic esterification was about 96%. However, the presence of a rare-earth element in the photocatalyst will lead to high costs and will not improve profit for the biodiesel industry.
Recently, an elegant approach for the production of diesel and jet fuels has been proposed by Chinese researchers.292 In this work, fatty acids obtained from soybean and tall oils were converted into C12–C18 alkanes via decarboxylation using a hydrogenated Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst under 365 nm UV light. It is well known that industrial waste containing bio-derived long-chain fatty acids could serve as a sustainable feedstock for diesel and jet fuels.293 However, the required temperature of 250–300 °C for this reaction and high-pressure hydrogen make the process expensive and energy intensive. In this regard, photoinitiation can help to convert fatty acids under mild conditions (30 °C, 0.2 MPa H2) and gives a high yield of the desired alkanes (≥ 90%).292 This research introduces an efficient biomass-upgrading method and provides an opportunity to produce diesel fuels from bio-based fatty acid feedstocks.


5.2.2. Photocatalytic conversion of glycerol. 
The increasing production of biodiesel has resulted in a surplus of crude glycerol, making aqueous glycerol an attractive compound for the synthesis of fine and crude chemicals. Nowadays, approximately 2.7 million tons of crude glycerol is produced annually in the biodiesel industry.294 All this has led to very intensive research in the field of glycerol transformations. For example, more than 2800 research articles and 15 reviews on this topic have been published since 2018 (Scopus database).295 Due to glycerol possessing three hydroxyl groups, many routes and technologies have been described and developed to valorise glycerol: thermochemical conversion, oxidation, dehydration, hydrogenolysis, esterification, biological conversion, aqueous phase reforming, bioconversion, etc. In our opinion, a promising approach from a sustainable development point of view is the photocatalytic conversion of glycerol using solar energy. There are two major strategies to convert glycerol using photocatalysts: (i) photoreforming for hydrogen evolution; (ii) photooxidation to produce a wide range of organic compounds, such as dihydroxyacetone, glyceraldehyde, glycolaldehyde, glycolic acid, formic acid, tartronic acid, hydroxypyruvic acid, propylene glycol, methylglyoxal, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, ethylene glycol, dimethyl-1,4-dioxane, acetone, ethanol, and methanol.296,297
As for the production of hydrogen, the use of glycerol provides a higher reaction rate compared with other alcohols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, etc.) in the presence of a TiO2-based photocatalyst.298 This fact can be explained by the higher polarity of glycerol because of the presence of three hydroxyl groups, which make the physical adsorption of the glycerol molecule on the TiO2 surface more efficient. The obtained results are also important from the point of view that methanol or ethanol are traditionally used as sacrificial agents for water splitting for hydrogen production.299,300 The use of glycerol for this purpose is advantageous, yielding seven moles of hydrogen from one mole of glycerol under mild conditions, making this process suitable for industrial applications. The presence of glycerol in water leads to a reaction between them under photocatalytic conditions that leads to the additional formation of CO2:301,302 SC + hυ → h+VB + e−CB(R21) (R22) 14e−CB + 14H+ → 7H2(R23)
Perhaps the formation of carbon dioxide during the process is its main disadvantage due to additional excess CO2 emissions, compared with methanol as a sacrificial agent, and requirements for its capture and storage.
The most common photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution using glycerol as a sustainable raw material is TiO2. The photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide is enhanced in standard ways, such as using a co-catalyst or doping agent. So, the effect of the metal co-catalyst's nature (Au, Pt, Pd) on the hydrogen evolution reaction using glycerol and 2-propanol as sacrificial agents was studied by López-Tenllado et al.303 For glycerol transformation, the activity order was as follows: Pt ≈ Au > Pd. At the same time, the activity decreased in the order of Pt > Au > Pd using 2-propanol, which is in correlation with the work functions of the metals: 5.7 eV (Pt) > 5.6 eV (Pd) > 5.3 eV (Au). The more complex order for glycerol photoreforming can be explained by not only a dehydrogenation mechanism taking place, but also decarbonylation. It was also shown that Au- and Pd-codeposited onto the TiO2 surface gave a synergetic effect.304 In this case, the hydrogen yield is higher, of around 40% and 15%, when only Au or Pd is deposited onto the TiO2 samples, respectively. Although noble metals, especially Pt, are the most common co-catalysts for hydrogen production from glycerol under photocatalytic conditions, other metals, including Earth-abundant Cu,305 Ni,306 Co,306etc., have also been employed to enhance the TiO2 activity.
Doping a semiconductor with metallic (Cu, Cr, Co, Fe, Ni) and non-metallic (N, B) ions can be employed as another method to shift the adsorption of light toward the visible range and increase the photocatalytic activity under solar light.307 For example, Luo et al.308 showed that co-doped N–B–TiO2 photocatalyst had a lower bandgap (2.98 eV) compared with TiO2 (3.05 eV) due to the synergistic effect of B and N, which led to the formation of defects. The co-doped photocatalyst enhanced the hydrogen production rate from glycerol by around 66% more than a single-doped N–TiO2 photocatalyst.
Recently, MOFs have attracted attention for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under UV light from a glycerol–water mixture. For the production of hydrogen, Ibrahim's group used a cyanide bridged bimetallic (Cu/Ni) coordination polymer (CP-1) as a co-cocatalyst for TiO2.309,310 The authors found that the CP-1/TiO2 composite exhibited considerable hydrogen production in comparison with pristine CP-1 and TiO2 (P25), highlighting that the photocatalytic performance is significantly related to the good separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.309 CP-1 can also be used as a single-source precursor of highly dispersed Cu and Ni nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface.310 Another example of when a metal–organic framework was employed as a precursor for metal nanoparticles was demonstrated by Majeed et al.311 The authors used MOF-199 ([Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)3]n) material to obtain TiO2-MOF-199 composite, which then was calcined at various temperatures in air to produce highly dispersed Cu–Cu2O nanoparticles on TiO2.
TiO2/HKUST-1 composites were synthesised by grinding, solvothermal, and chemical methods, and then employed as efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution from 10 vol% glycerol aqueous solution.312 It was demonstrated that the composite prepared by a chemical route, i.e., by the synthesis of HKUST-1 in the presence of TiO2, led to a strong interaction between the two components and, correspondingly, to the best photocatalytic performances. These results can be explained by a synergetic effect between the semiconductor and MOF, inhibiting electron–hole recombination. However, this composite did not show good stability, leading to a reduction in the production rate by ca. 50% after the fifth cycle compared with the first run. An explanation for this unfavourable behaviour could be a partial reduction of Cu2+ contained in the original HKUST-1 material by photogenerated electrons in the TiO2 conduction band.
The photocatalytic conversion of glycerol into value-added liquid products, such as dihydroxyacetone, glyceraldehyde, glycolaldehyde, tartronic acid, hydroxypyruvic acid, and lactic acid propylene glycol, is an interesting route to utilise surplus glycerol (Table 9). The oxidation of the primary OH group of glycerol results in the formation of glyceraldehyde, while the oxidation of the secondary OH group is more favourable for the production of dihydroxyacetone, both of which are important chemicals for the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.313 Further oxidation of glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone generates other liquid products.

A key aspect of this process is the ability to control selectivity due to the vast range of components that can be produced via glycerol valorisation. In this regard, the development of highly selective photocatalysts is an interesting and important field of research, since isolation and separation are expensive processes and will lead to an increase in the manufacturing costs and possible waste generation.
Complete conversion of glycerol is achieved at low glycerol concentrations. At the same time, it was shown that suitable conversions (93%) could be obtained at even medium concentrations (6.7 vol%).314 The available works have demonstrated that the most selective compound formed from glycerol during photocatalytic oxidation is dihydroxyacetone, the selectivity of which can exceed 90%.313,315 Among other selective compounds, glyceraldehyde,316 glycolic acid,317 acetaldehyde,318 formaldehyde,314 and formic acid319 have also been reported in the literature. However, very limited investigations are devoted to the photocatalytic production of solar fuels (like methanol and ethanol)320 and acrolein.321 Solar fuels have great importance considering the global energy crisis, while acrolein is a key intermediate in the production of acrylic acid.
Most studies on the conversion of glycerol under photocatalytic conditions focused on the effect of the photocatalyst type. Hermes et al.322 compared the behaviour of ZnO and TiO2 in the photocatalytic oxidation of glycerol under UV irradiation. They found that around 16 times more glyceraldehyde and 2.5 times more dihydroxyacetone could be produced using ZnO as a photocatalyst. The authors concluded that using TiO2 led to cleavage of the C–C bonds with the formation of formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde, while ZnO tended to sustain C–C bonds and mostly produced glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone. The C-doped TiO2 photocatalyst with different cellulose loadings for the density of the carbon dopant to be tuned allowed a high glycerol conversion rate to be obtained with high yields of glyceraldehyde (10.0%), dihydroxyacetone (7.4%), formic acid (49.0%), and acetic acid (1.8%) in the presence of H2O2 as an oxidant (Fig. 10).319 The main oxidation products (glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone) are formed by the oxidation of hydroxyl radicals (HO˙), which are generated by two main routes. In the first route, the H2O molecule initially attacks at the lattice O sites (Ti–O˙) on the TiO2 surface. Then, the water molecule is oxidised by photogenerated holes obtained from photon activation of TiO2. The second route includes the generation of HO˙ radicals in the reaction system via the photolysis of H2O2. A similar mechanism was observed by Chong et al.,323 who studied the conversion of glucose in the aqueous phase in the presence of TiO2-based photocatalysts.

Among other frequently studied photocatalysts, systems based on the perovskites313,324 and graphitic carbon nitride should be singled out.325
Interesting results were obtained by Zhou et al.,326 who investigated the light-driven integration of the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline with a selectivity of 95% and the conversion of glycerol into valuable chemicals in water using the Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst (Fig. 11). This process can potentially enhance the atom economy of glycerol oxidation because the hydrogen atoms of glycerol are not converted into value-added products during the photooxidation process, but they are oxidised to water.

5.3. A short overview
Biomass represents an important, abundant, and renewable carbon source that is available to produce value-added chemicals. However, despite the fact that photocatalysis has the smallest carbon footprint compared with the thermochemical and biological conversion of biomass, it lags far behind in terms of efficiency. This situation can be explained by two factors:
(1) In the overwhelming majority of studies, bare TiO2 and that doped with noble metals remain the most commonly studied photocatalysts, even though they are not effective under visible light. In this regard, the use of MOFs can have enormous potential, since these materials are already actively employed in the photoreforming of glycerol and other reactions.
(2) It is difficult to choose optimal photocatalytic conditions because biomass contains numerous compounds and its composition varies significantly (especially, for lignocellulose). Therefore, it is necessary to use model compounds, such as glycerol, lignin, and carbohydrates, to optimize the photocatalyst system.
6. Summary and future perspectives
Green chemistry is not just a small and independent part of chemistry, but more importantly a philosophy that will be a non-separable field of chemical science. Our generation of chemists should practice green chemistry to clean up our environment. In this regard, there are a lot of routes to reevaluate in current research, for example, in organic synthesis (oxidation, reduction, conversion of biomass), to enhance the green component, photocatalysis is one of the most interesting and promising methods.
As has been clearly shown here, many efforts have been made in the context of high demands for the development of sustainable routes to produce practically important organic chemicals using photocatalytic conditions. One of the main advantages of photocatalysis is that reactions can be conducted under mild reaction conditions under solar irradiation. Nowadays, the most popular photocatalysts include systems based on titanium dioxide, the perovskite oxides (especially, Bi-containing), and graphitic carbon nitride. The listed photocatalytic systems can also be successfully combined to increase the yield of target products and shift their photosensitivity to the visible region. It should also be noted that there are other ways to enhance the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of various materials. Among them, depositing a co-catalyst, doping with ions, and synthesizing carbonaceous composites are the most commonly used approaches. The deposition of a co-catalyst is the most followed route, and noble metals such as Pt and Au are the most effective co-catalysts. Perhaps, the use of noble metals is the main disadvantage of this approach because of their high price. Therefore, investigations should be shifted towards using Earth-abundant metals, such as Cu, Ni, and Fe, as co-catalysts. Moreover, not only physicochemical properties, such as phase structure, band gap position, light absorption ability, surface/interface structure, defects, and morphology, which depend on the photocatalyst type and its preparation method, but also reaction conditions (light intensity and source, solvent type, temperature, oxidant type in the case of oxidation) significantly impact on the activity and selectivity. As a result, it is hard to establish a relationship between the catalytic performance and a particular effect due to the complexity of multiple factors and photocatalytic procedures, and there have been no attempts to scale-up processes.
In this critical review, we have also shown that metal–organic frameworks are interesting materials that act as hybridizing photosensitizers and semiconductors within one porous photocatalyst network with theoretical band gaps ranging from 1.0 to 5.5 eV due to the structural nature of the metal nodes and organic linkers. These materials have been successfully employed in many organic photoreactions, e.g., the hydroxylation of aromatic hydrocarbons, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, the reduction of carbon dioxide and nitroaromatics, and the reforming of glycerol. It is considered that the development of increasingly efficient MOFs is a key research area in catalysis as well as photocatalysis, due to their potential benefits related to the tunable chemical structures and versatile applications.100,101 Important advantages of these materials are facilitated adsorption towards chemicals and efficient light absorption. As has been highlighted, there are several strategies for MOF applications in organic synthesis under photocatalytic conditions: (i) they can be used as primary photocatalysts capable of harvesting visible light along with providing active centers; (ii) MOFs can be coupled with semiconductors because of their versatility (the MOF structure acts as a co-catalyst to promote a higher catalytic activity); and (iii) these materials can be utilised as precursors for the preparation of photosensitive materials. The last approach seems to be the most unpromising due to the complexity and high cost. The main challenges for the industrial scale application of MOFs are their low photocatalytic stability, yield, and turnover number compared with well-known semiconductor photocatalysts. In some cases, it is necessary to add a sacrificial agent or electron donor to a reaction medium, which is not economical, technological and eco-friendly. Thus, given that this field is relatively new, it is expected that current studies and efforts will stimulate new perspectives in MOF-based photocatalysis for industrial applications that are non-economically sustainable nowadays.
It should be noted that, in terms of sustainability, it is highly important to produce MOFs with cost-effectiveness. Nowadays, only a small number of MOF products are produced commercially by international companies, such as BASF (Germany), MOF Technologies Ltd (UK) and Strem Chemicals Inc. (USA).329 Taking the Sigma-Aldrich MOF product (Basolite® Z1200, ZIF-8) as an example, the commercial price is approximately USD 1500 per 100 g (ref. 330) which is very high. So, for the application of MOFs in photocatalysis, it is necessary to develop sustainable, green and cost-effective production processes, which should include the use of (i) cheap, renewable, and recyclable metal salts and linkers, (ii) a solvent-free synthesis method or green solvents such as water, (iii) cost-effective energy sources, and (iv) well-designed synthesis methods with low temperatures and pressures.
