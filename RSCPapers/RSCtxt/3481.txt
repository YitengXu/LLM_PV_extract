    , Accepted 21st March 2022First published on 25th March 2022AbstractPotassium nitrilotriacetate (NTAK) was employed to modify the buried SnO2/perovskite interface. Benefiting from the coordination roles of carboxyl and amino groups, and the diffusion role of potassium ions, NTAK could enhance the bilateral connection, improve perovskite morphology, suppress non-radiation recombination, and reduce the hysteresis effect. The optimal device with NTAK modification achieved an effective power conversion efficiency of 21.02%. This was a successful attempt to improve the buried interface.
The energy conversion efficiency (PCE) of hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been reported to be 25.7%.1 This value is associated with the excellent features of the perovskite material itself: low cost of the raw material, high mobility, variable bandgap, strong extinction coefficient, and long carrier lifetime and bipolar transmission.2,3 The electron-transport layer (ETL) plays a vital part in PSCs. The widely used TiO2 ETL is limited by its own relatively poor optical stability and electron-transport ability.4 Compared with the TiO2 ETL, the SnO2 ETL has extensive applications due to its wider bandgap, higher transmittance and electron mobility, and better stability under ultraviolet illumination.4
A layered device structure is dependent upon a close interface connection because it can affect carrier collection and transport, growth of perovskite grains, and device stability, especially for the buried SnO2 ETL/perovskite interface. However, due to the lack of nucleation template function of mesoporous scaffolds, the thin SnO2 ETL can cause unsatisfactory nucleation and growth of perovskites.5 Meanwhile, the environmental sensitivity of SnO2 during wet spin-coating results in the inevitable “dangling” bonds of Sn4+ and oxygen-vacancy defects, which attenuate the device performance by causing electron accumulation, carrier recombination, and current–voltage hysteresis.6 Besides, the uncoordinated Pb2+ defects at the buried perovskite interface also affect the efficiency and stability of the PSC by obstructing electron collection at the interface.6 Therefore, improving the buried SnO2 ETL/perovskite interface is needed.
Three main strategies have been used to improve the ETL/perovskite. The first is a ligands-assisted ETL strategy. Li et al. employed ligand-tailored SnO2 quantum dots as the ETL in which multifunctional groups enhanced the interface binding and refined the buried interface.7 The second is a self-assembly monolayer (SAM) strategy.2,8,9 Yan et al. introduced a choline chloride SAM at the SnO2/perovskite interface to reduce oxygen vacancies at the interface. Also, the presence of Cl− can aid formation of Pb–Cl bonds with the perovskite, thereby improving the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the device.8 The third is a dimensional engineering strategy. Zhao et al. used a functional 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoroacetate (EMIMTFA) ionic liquid to form a one-dimensional (1D) EMIMPbI3 perovskite. The latter passivated the defects through the interface-passivation roles of TFA− and the multi-level passivation roles of EMIM+.10 Compared with these three strategies, interface-modification strategies have shown greater potential because the molecules used for interface modification are highly devisable. Yang et al. designed a series of bioinspired molecules based on dopamine to realize bilateral synergistic passivation in buried interfaces.6 However, the dopamine molecule tends to self-polymerize and form insulate polymers. Zwitterionic compounds can also be added to the SnO2/perovskite interface,11 which connects with SnO2 and perovskite by chemical bonds to reduce the defects and increase the charge-extraction capability. However, the insulation of alkyl chains used for connecting zwitterionic compounds can interfere with electron transfer.12 Therefore, choosing a reasonable molecule as a modifier is the key to interface modification.
Nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) has been used to modulate the crystal growth of MAPbI3 perovskite by selective adsorption on crystallographic faces and to retard its growth rate.3 Therefore, we used the multifunctional NTA molecule to modify the SnO2/perovskite interface. Here, we chose potassium hydroxide (KOH) aqueous solution as the solvent to dissolve NTA because it is slightly soluble in hot water and insoluble in most organic solvents. After dissolving, the NTA reacts with KOH to produce NTAK. NTA− is used widely as a lead-remover because it is a typical tetradentate ligand,13 in which the COO− can combine not only with oxygen on SnO2, but also can chelate with uncoordinated Pb2+ defects. Besides, the –NH2 group in the NTA molecule can act as a growth site of the perovskite. The K+ in NTAK can reduce hysteresis by diffusing into the perovskite to inhibit the migration of iodine anions.14 Incorporating NTAK into the SnO2/perovskite interface can not only enhance the interface connection and electron extraction, it can also passivate the defects in the buried perovskite. A device with NTAK modification shows enhanced photovoltaic performances and reduced hysteresis.
The device structure is shown in Fig. 1a. The NTAK shown in Fig. 1b was modified at the SnO2/perovskite interface. For the electrostatic potential (ESP) maps shown in Fig. 1c, the charge density changed from −7.5 × 10−1 to 7.5 × 10−1 and changed from red to blue. A more negative ESP implies higher electron density.15 The ESP maps of NTAK indicated that the highest electron density was on the –COO− group.

X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the interface connection mode in detail. As shown in Fig. 1d and Fig. S1 (ESI†), after modifying the NTAK on SnO2, the binding energy decreased from 486.13 eV and 494.56 eV to 485.78 eV and 494.24 eV for Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2, respectively.7 Besides, the binding energy of lattice O and chemisorbed hydroxyl O was reduced. The decreased binding energy of Sn 3d and O 1s revealed that SnO2 could obtain electrons from NTAK, so that the –COO− group could link to the lattice oxygen and –OH group on SnO2 preferentially. The interaction between –COO– and lattice oxygen indicated that NTAK could passivate the oxygen-vacancy defect of SnO2. The increased binding energy of N 1s for –(CH2)3N can be because N could link to –OH on SnO2 by hydrogen-bond interaction.
PbI2 was used in a simplified experiment to show an interaction of NTAK with potential undercoordinated Pb-centers in the perovskite (Fig. 1e and Fig. S2, ESI†). After deposition with NTAK, the Pb 4f7/2 shifted from 138.54 eV to 138.16 eV, and the Pb 4f5/2 declined from 143.47 eV to 143.05 eV.6 The reduced binding energy of Pb 4f and increased binding energy of O 1s and N 1s showed that NTAK could connect well to buried perovskite by donating electrons to uncoordinated Pb2+. The XPS results shown above verify that NTAK at the SnO2/perovskite interface could act as a double-connected interfacial chemical bridge. The bilateral connection structure shown in Scheme 1 helped to obtain an excellent interface-contact performance.

The negligible difference in optical transmission reveals that the NTAK modification have no negative effect on light harvesting (Fig. S3) (ESI†).

It can be seen from Fig. 2a-b and Fig. S4 (ESI†) that the grain size of the perovskite film increased and number of pinholes decreased after modification of 0.75 mM NTAK. This effect occurred because NTAK could coordinate with PbI2 to retard the crystallization rate of the perovskite (Fig. S5, ESI†). The thickness of the perovskite film also increased slightly (from 560 nm to 580 nm), which led to a slightly increased intensity of light absorption (Fig. S6, ESI†). After modification of the SnO2 substrate with NTAK, the perovskite grains were arranged in a more orderly fashion, which helped to reduce the path of electron transport. Hence, NTAK introduction could improve the quality of the perovskite film. In Fig. 2c, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) diffraction peaks at 14.0° and 28.3° are correspond to the (110) and (220) planes of perovskite structure. After NTAK modification, the increased intensity of diffraction peaks reflected that NTAK incorporation could improve the crystallinity of perovskite films.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to ascertain the effects of NTAK modification on the structure of the interface energy level.
As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), Fig. 2d, and Table S1 (ESI†), the energy level of valence band (EVB) and conduvtive band (ECB) of SnO2 are −8.12 eV and −4.22 eV, respectively. After modification with NTAK, the ECB of SnO2 shifted to −4.17 eV, thereby being closer to the CB of the perovskite. An energy-level alignment such as this can aid electron extraction at the ETL/perovskite interface.
 Fig. 3  (a) steady-state PL and (b) TRPL spectra of perovskite films deposited on SnO2 films without or with NTAK modification. 
According to Fig. 3a and Fig. S8 (ESI†), the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the perovskite film based on the 0.75 mM NTAK-modified SnO2 ETL decreased. In Fig. 3b and Table S2 (ESI†), the fitted time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra from the double-exponential equation show that SnO2/NTAK/perovskite had an average lifetime (τave) of 31.88 ns, shorter than that of the SnO2/perovskite (61.73 ns). Hence, the NTAK modification could enhance electron transfer and reduce electron recombination at the SnO2/perovskite interface.
The NTAK modification can reduce the defects density and leakage current (Fig. S9a–b, ESI†). The results of Mott–Schottky plots, Nyquist plots, and light intensity-dependent VOC and JSC shown in Fig. S9c-d (ESI†) and Fig. S10 (ESI†) (ESI†) also indicate that the NTAK modification helped to enhance carrier transport and reduce recombination.16
After modification with NTAK (0.75 mM), the devices achieved an average PCE of 20.47 ± 0.55%, higher than that of control devices (18.58 ± 0.80%) (Table S3 and Fig. S8, ESI†). The control device based on bare SnO2 ETL achieved a maximal PCE of 19.06% (JSC = 23.58 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.05 V, FF = 77.00%) (Fig. 4a, Fig. S9 and Table S4, ESI†). In comparison, the device modified using 0.75 mM NTAK yields a maximal PCE of 21.02% (JSC = 24.95 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.08 V, FF = 78.00%.), thereby outperforming most Cs-MA-FA-based PSCs in other works (Table S5, ESI†). Besides, compared with control devices, the hysteresis in the device modified with 0.75 mM NTAK decreased obviously, which could be evidenced by the reduced hysteresis factor.

In Fig. 4b, the EQE of the NTAK-modified device was higher than that of the control device. Also, the integrated JSC increased from 21.67 mA cm−2 of control devices to 22.89 mA cm−2 of target devices, which corresponded to the results of the J–V test. Fig. S13 (ESI†) depicts the stable-output current density and PCE versus time of the control devices and target devices measured at the maximum power point. After 500 s, the control device gave an output current density of 22.97 mA cm−2 and output PCE of 18.38%. The device modified with 0.75 mM NTAK produced an output current density of 24.00 mA cm−2 and output PCE of 19.92% after 500 s. These data indicate that the NTAK-modified device was more stable.
As shown in Fig. 4c and d, after aging in a moisture-proof box (relative humidity (RH) = 1–2%) and in air (RH = 20–30%), the target devices retained 89% and 74% of their original PCE, respectively, and outperformed devices that were not modified with NTAK (78% and 49%, respectively). The evolution trend of normalized JSC, VOC, and FF in Fig. S14 and S15 (ESI†) verified that NTAK modification could enhance device stability further. After modification with NTAK, retarded crystallization rate, improved crystallization morphologies with reduced pinholes, and reduced hysteresis enhanced device stability.
Inhibiting I− migration is an effective method to reduce hysteresis.17 In Fig. 5a, a toluene solution soaked with perovskite but without NTAK showed an obvious iodine-absorption peak at 500 nm,18 whereas the toluene leachate of the NTAK-modified perovskite exhibited a negligible absorption peak at 500 nm. These results indicated that NTAK could reduce the amount of iodine released. The I− at the lattice site and interstitial site capture holes and then diffuse, combine and become oxidized to generate I2.18 Therefore, blocking the migration path of I− can inhibit I2 release. In Fig. 5b and Fig. S16 (ESI†), time of flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) depth profiling and cross-sectional elemental linear depiction demonstrated that K+ could diffuse from the NTAK-modifier at the interface to the perovskite film. As depicted in Scheme 1, I− could migrate from perovskite lattice, and leave the Frenkel defect of I− in its original position. After modification with NTAK, K+ could diffuse from NTAK into the perovskite to block the mitigation pathways of I− and prevent formation of the Frenkel defect of iodide, thereby resulting in decreased I2 release and reduced hysteresis. After NTAK modification, the disappeared Pb0 peak showed that NTAK could suppress I2 generation by inhibiting I− migration (Fig. S17, ESI†).

In summary, we modified the buried SnO2 ETL/perovskite interface by employing multifunctional NTAK. NTAK could link to the SnO2 side via the interaction between –COO− and –OH/lattice O of SnO2 and hydrogen-bond interaction between –(CH2)3N and –OH on SnO2. These actions helped to passivate the oxygen-vacancy defect of SnO2. Besides, NTAK can connect to the perovskite side by coordination between –COO−/–(CH2)3N and Pb, which could retard the crystallization rate, passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ defects, and improve the morphology of the perovskite film. In addition, NTAK could reduce the hysteresis by the I− migration-inhibition role of K+. The enhanced bilateral interface connections and passivation roles helped to enhance extraction of the interfacial carrier. The improved crystallization morphologies of perovskite films and reduced hysteresis can reduce the nonradiative recombination. Ultimately, the NTAK-modified device exhibited enhanced efficiency and stability. Thus, the present work provides a new strategy to modulate the buried SnO2/perovskite interface for high-performance devices.
