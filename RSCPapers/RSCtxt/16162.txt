    , Accepted 27th September 2018First published on 28th September 2018AbstractHighly defected tubular SiO2 is found to outperform the activity of TiO2-P25 and the SiO2–TiO2 composite in photocatalytic H2 generation from methanol–water solution under simulated solar light AM 1.5. The enhanced performances of SiO2 come from the particularities of the reaction mechanism and ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation. The SiO2 exposed to light generates solely 1O2 (singlet oxygen). The TiO2-P25 produces uniquely large quantities of ˙OH radicals whereas the formation of O2− is evidenced only over SiO2–TiO2, along with small amounts of ˙OH. The TiO2 works as a photocatalyst by intermediation of ˙OH radicals. In contrast, the organic substrate is activated on the surface of SiO2 by the intra-band gap, isolated, surface quantum defects. Distinct reaction mechanisms, involving the participation of photogenerated charges and ROS, are proposed. The material-related ROS production can be of great practical importance in fields such as biology (germ inactivation), medicine (photodynamic therapy by 1O2), and synthesis of oxygenated organic compounds of great added value.
1. Introduction
Great research efforts are devoted to discovering new classes of materials able to harvest and convert solar energy into electric power (photovoltaic and dye sensitized solar cells) or to drive chemical reactions (photocatalysis).1,2 The exponential development of solar captors is steamed by applications in strategic fields such as depollution, energy, sensors, optical devices, etc.3–8 At the present stage, the great majority of photo-active materials are based on TiO2 due to its important advantages such as chemical stability, high photoactivity, relative abundance and non-toxicity.1,9 There are fewer studies focusing on other photoreactive semiconductors such as simple/mixed oxides (i.e. perovskites, pyrochlores), tantalates, metal nitrides and sulfides, graphene-based nanocomposites, etc.10–13 In many cases, however, they show lower performances compared to bare TiO2 and critical drawbacks such as photocorrosion, leading to release of pollutants in water and deactivation.10,14
Searches for new materials, for innovative concepts, are also vital for further progress in the field of solar energy utilization. A relatively newly spotted, cheap, non-toxic and abundant candidate worth being closely investigated is silica. At present, various SiO2 materials have been investigated as optically active materials mostly due to their strong green photoluminescence.15 The belief is that the poor light-absorbing properties of typical SiO2 associated with its extra-large band gap (typically Eg > 7 eV)16 should exclude this material from photochemical applications. Our research group was the first to report that, in contrast to spherically-shaped SiO2 nanoparticles, the ≈320 nm light absorbed by tubular SiO2 is able to trigger the mineralization of oxalic acid.17 A pivotal question to answer is whether this large band gap insulator can be a photoactive material as effective as TiO2. In wide-gap glass materials, the short-range order influences decisively the electronic states.18 The starting idea of our research was that the optically active lattice defects of strained SiO2 with unusual morphologies may work as active sites in photo-driven redox processes.16,19 Further material development carried out in our group led to the synthesis of tubular SiO2 having an increased density of optically active surface defects.20
One progress direction in light harvesting materials is to coat the photo-reactive tubular SiO2 with thin layers of TiO2. The interface built up between the insulator and semiconductor may lead to composites with useful, unpredicted properties. SiO2–TiO2 composites are actually of great interest due to their potential for practical applications, i.e. photocatalysis,21–23 light scattering materials for dye-sensitized solar cells,24 optical waveguides,25 antireflective and self-cleaning coatings,26 anodes for lithium-ion batteries,27etc. Coating TiO2 with SiO2 has a determinant influence on the activity for ROS (reactive oxygen species) formation under light irradiation.28
From theoretical and practical points of view, there is a need to bring clarification on the particularities of photocatalytic processes taking place on the SiO2 insulator in comparison with the well-known TiO2 semiconductor. It is documented that ˙OH radicals, formed by participation of photogenerated holes and electrons, are key players in the mechanism of organic photocatalytic mineralization over TiO2.1 Essential questions point to the origin, nature and properties of sites responsible for the photo-induced reactivity of SiO2. It is important to know the ROS formed on the surfaces of SiO2, SiO2–TiO2 and TiO2 (Degussa P25, used as a reference material) and their specific role in photochemical processes. ROS are of great significance not only in photochemistry but also in biological and medical domains (germ inactivation, antitumoral activity).29–32 In addition, singlet oxygen (1O2) can be an important tool in organic synthesis.33
The objectives of this research are to investigate comparatively: (i) the optical and photocatalytic properties of simple SiO2, TiO2-modified tubular SiO2 (SiO2–TiO2) and commercial TiO2 (P25 Degussa), (ii) the formation of ˙OH radicals, ˙O2− (oxygen superoxide) and 1O2 (singlet oxygen) under light irradiation by using selective radical quenchers, (iii) the relationship between the photocatalytic behavior and generation of specific ROS, (iv) the contribution of lattice defects to the photocatalytic activity of SiO2 and (iv) the advance pertinent reaction and ROS generation mechanisms with emphasis on the particularities observed for semiconducting and insulating materials. The photocatalytic generation of H2 from a water–methanol mixture under simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5) was selected as a model reaction to attain the above-mentioned goals. This model reaction is convenient to assess the photocatalytic performances of various materials.34
2. Experimental
The synthesis of optically/photocatalytically active tubular SiO2 (labeled SiO2) was reported earlier.17,20 In essence, the employed sol–gel preparation method is a modified version from previously published work.35 Briefly, ammonia gas was bubbled into an aqueous solution of tartaric acid (TA) at room temperature and then was cooled down to 0 °C. TEOS (tetraethyl orthosilicate) was slowly added to the gently stirred solution. The molar ratios between the precursors TEOS/TA/C2H5OH/H2O was 1/0.035/21.5/18. The obtained sol was aged for 5 hours, filtered, dried at 100 °C for one hour and thermally annealed in air at 500 °C for 3 hours.
The tubular SiO2 coated with TiO2 (denoted hereafter as SiO2–TiO2) was prepared by dropwise addition of TiPOT (titanium isopropoxide, Aldrich 97%) ethanolic solution to the pre-synthesized silica sol obtained as described above. The molar ratio of Si/Ti was adjusted to be 1/0.045. The thermal treatment (drying and annealing) of the SiO2–TiO2 gel was identical to that of SiO2.
The synthesized materials were characterized throughout by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Quanta 3D FEG model), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2-F30), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer Rigaku operated at 40 kV and 30 mA using Cu Kα radiation), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG Esca 3 Mk II spectrometer using an Al Kα radiation source at 1486.7 eV), and diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 spectrophotometer). Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 automated gas adsorption system. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed in true non-contact mode with an XE-100 apparatus (Park Systems).
The photocatalytic activities of SiO2, SiO2–TiO2 and reference TiO2-P25 under simulated solar light AM 1.5 (1000 W m−2, Peccell-L01) were tested. The photoreactor, provided with a 4.5 × 4.5 cm2 optical quartz window, was cooled with a chiller (Julabo F12) at 18 °C. The screened powder materials were dispersed in 104 mL ultrapure water and 16 mL methanol and then exposed to light. During the reaction, the reactor was purged continuously with Ar carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The composition of the carrier gas, passed through a condenser chilled at −5 °C to remove water and methanol from the gas stream, was measured every 30 minutes using a gas chromatograph (Buck Scientific 910) provided with TCD detectors. The H2 and CO2 reaction products were separated and quantified on molecular sieves 5 Å and Hayesep columns, respectively.
Measurement of hydroxyl radical concentration was performed in quartz cuvettes containing 7.84 μM aqueous solution of fluorescein sodium salt (FL, Sigma Aldrich). The photocatalytic oxides suspended in FL solution were irradiated at room temperature with AM 1.5 light. The consumption of FL in time, due to reaction with ˙OH radicals, was determined at a time interval of 15 min by measuring the fluorescence at 515 nm (λex = 303 nm).36
XTT [2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide] is widely used for specific detection of O2−.37 The characteristic absorption peak of XTT-formazan, resulting from reduction of XTT by O2−, is located at ≈475 nm. The formation of O2− in time under AM 1.5 irradiation over 1 mg of oxide materials was monitored using 3 mL of 100 μM aqueous solution of XTT. The absorbance of XTT-added samples was measured at a time interval of 60 min.
The SOSG green reagent is frequently used as a singlet oxygen sensor.38 The anthracene part of SOSG reacts with 1O2 to form endoperoxide (SOSG-1O2) which emits strong green fluorescence at ≈535 nm (λex = 488 nm).38 SOSG is highly selective for 1O2 in comparison with hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) and superoxide (O2−) species.39 A stock solution of 5 mM was prepared by dissolution in methanol. The 1O2 generation over SiO2, SiO2–TiO2 and TiO2 was monitored using SOSG stock diluted with CH3OH to 3.33 μM. The consumption of SOSG was evaluated from the photobleaching rate of UV-vis absorption maxima at 517 nm.
3. Results and discussion
Predominant tubular-shaped SiO2 can be observed in Fig. 1(a). In addition, small amounts of spherical SiO2 particles can either be perceived as an independent phase or located on the surface of silica tubes. The external diameter of the thinner tubes (minor phase) is in the 400–600 nm range and the wall thickness lies between 100 and 200 nm [Fig. 1(a)]. The larger SiO2 tubes (main phase), with diameters ranging between 1–4 μm, are characterized by thin walls (20–60 nm) which may imply a strained and defected lattice structure. The length of the thinner tubes may stretch out to more than 100 μm whereas the thicker tubes are shorter. The SiO2 tubes with larger diameter, transparent, filmy walls are brittle as many of their broken fragments can be seen in the collected SEM images. A single SiO2 tube is imaged by AFM microscopy on a larger scale [Fig. 1(b)]. From the selected area [marked by a black square in Fig. 1(b)], the detailed scan reveals a flat, low rugosity surface. Most of the surface features are located in a z-height of only 0.5 nm. Random nanometric pores, with diameters ranging between 5–12 nm (mean diameter is around 8 nm), can be also seen in the inset of Fig. 1(b).

The pores are likely closed as the surface area of calcined tubular SiO2 is only ≈6 m2 g−1. The SEM micrograph of SiO2–TiO2 in Fig. 1(c) reveals emergence of a novel morphology characterized by TiO2 glaze covering the tubular SiO2 entities.
The non-uniform thickness of the TiO2 coating is evidenced in the magnified AFM image of one selected particle in Fig. 1(d). Large interconnected grains of the TiO2 phase coating SiO2 tubes can be visualized in the inset of the same figure. The deposition of TiO2 on SiO2 tubes increases the surface area of the material from 6 to ≈21 m2 g−1.
The absorption peaks of TiO2 in the UV region in Fig. 2(a) are due to electronic transitions from the O2p valence band to the Ti3d conduction band.40 The optical absorption of the SiO2–TiO2 composite, peaking at ≈300 nm, is weaker but keeps features resembling that of TiO2. The optical absorption edge located at ≈400 nm is the contribution of the thin TiO2 coating on SiO2 tubes. The broad spectroscopic signature of SiO2, stretching from UV to visible regions, with maxima located at 256 and 342 nm [red trace in Fig. 2(a)], indicates a plethora of light absorbing defects. The light absorption peak of SiO2 is practically doubled conjointly with marked broadening of the absorbed wavelength interval compared to a material possessing a similar morphology described in our previous publication.17 Improved light harvesting capacity of the newly developed SiO2 material can be indubitably attributed to the increase in defect density and to favorable coupling strength between defects and matrix phonon modes.41 The light-absorbing performance of SiO2 becomes even better after exposure to AM 1.5 light during photocatalytic tests [see SiO2_SPENT in Fig. 2(b)]. As we shall see later, enhanced light absorption has a positive influence on photocatalytic activity.

Interpretation of optical absorption data of SiO2 materials is still controversial. The POR (peroxy radical, Si–O–O˙), POL (peroxy linkage, Si–O–O–Si) and dioxasilirane () defects (oxygen excess defects) give rise to optical absorption at ≈326 nm.42–44 The heat treatment of hydroxylated silica leads to the growth of the 326 nm band due to the reaction between oxygen vacancies and O2 with the formation of the POR.42
The candidates listed for light absorption at 256 nm are Si–O˙ (non-bonding oxygen hole centers, NBOHCs) and Si: (silylene).45 The weak shoulder visible at ≈214 nm in the spectra displayed in Fig. 2 is assigned by most studies to E′ defects (Si˙).46
The amorphous SiO2 exhibits a characteristic XRD pattern (see ESI† Fig. S1) consisting of a broad peak positioned at 2Θ ≈ 23°. The XRD pattern of SiO2–TiO2 contains weak reflections of crystalline TiO2 (2Θ ≈ 25, 28, 32, 38, and 46 degrees).
The Si2p XPS spectrum of SiO2 in Fig. 3(a) confirms the presence of only Si4+.47 The O1s binding energy of 532.7 eV of the same sample represents O2− of SiO2 [Fig. 3(b)].48 Significant changes observed after light irradiation in Fig. 3(c) unveil the appearance of an important fraction of Si3+ lattice defects (13.6 at%). The maximum at 532.7 eV of the O1s spectrum in Fig. 3(d) represents the typical lattice O2−.47,49 The appearance of new oxygen species, denoted as O* (6.4 at%), can be observed at 531.6 eV.

As Si3+ represents a negatively charged defect (one electron located on Si4+), O* should be a positively charged oxygen defect to obtain the overall charge balance. Both defects are created on the surface of the metastable, strained tubular structure by light irradiation in the course of photocatalytic tests. The likely candidates for positive oxygen defects are O−, O2− or O22−. Published literature reports giving information about the oxygen species in silica materials situated at lower binding energies (i.e. 531.6 eV) are scarce. One relevant XPS work on borosilicate glass by Miura et al.50 has ascribed the low energy maximum lying between 531 and 532 eV to “non-bridging oxide”.
The peaks A and B of the deconvoluted Si2p spectrum of the SiO2–TiO2 composite [Fig. 3(e)] represent Si4+ and Si3+, respectively. The relatively high amount of Si3+ defects (20.3 at%) is indicative of a strained and defected structure determined by the presence of TiO2.
The binding energies at 533 and 530.36 eV in the O1s region correspond to oxygen in Si–O–Si and Ti–O–Ti bonds, respectively.51,52 Peak C in the same spectrum represents the oxygen of water. Fig. 3(g) confirms that the titanium in TiO2–SiO2 is only in the form of Ti4+.
Additional experiments were carried out to obtain more information about optically active defects, assumed to be responsible for the photocatalytic activity of SiO2. Fig. 4 shows the extended FTIR spectrum of tubular SiO2 with the characteristic lines of Si–O bending and stretching at 834 and 1110 cm−1, respectively.
 Fig. 4  Extended FTIR spectrum of tubular SiO2. The inset shows the magnified region around 900 cm−1. 
The magnification of the 900 cm−1 region, presented in the inset of the same figure, unveils the existence of a weak band, which is not discernible at typical SiO2 samples. This band originates from the perturbed peroxide O–O stretching vibration of peroxide groups.53–55 There are reports claiming that the surface NBOHCs oscillate at 920 cm−1 whereas the stretching frequency of bulk NBOHCs is measured in the 860–890 cm−1 region.56 These results, corroborated with our experimental evidence strengthen our statement that the oxygen-related defects, including PORs and NBOHCs, are the best candidates to explain the optical and photocatalytic activity exhibited by tubular SiO2.
The photocatalytic generation of H2 and CO2 from a water–methanol mixture under simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5) was performed (i) to determine whether the light-absorbing defects of SiO2 are capable of working as active sites and (ii) to gather information on the nature and properties of these sites. The results obtained for SiO2 are compared with those collected for standard TiO2-P25 and SiO2–TiO2 (see Fig. 5). In the first 3 h of light irradiation, the steady-state rate of H2 formation over SiO2 was established at 24.7 μmol h−1, whereas over TiO2-P25 it was 16.6 μmol h−1 [see Fig. 5(a)]. The H2 production on the SiO2–TiO2 composite was only 0.3 μmol h−1. In the absence of any catalytic metal, the formation of CO2 halts on TiO2-P25 after the first hour and on SiO2 after two hours of irradiation. With the exception of SiO2, the output of CO2 was negligible. The total amount of CO2 accumulated in three hours of reaction was 17.3, 2.5 and 3.0 μmol on SiO2, SiO2–TiO2 and TiO2-P25, respectively [see Fig. 5(b)].

Experimental conditions: 0.025 g of powder catalyst, 104 mL H2O, 16 mL CH3OH, T = 18 °C, carrier Ar flow rate 20 cm3 min−1. 

Fig. 5(a) shows the enhancement in the photocatalytic activity of SiO2 exposed to UV light in the presence of O2 [experimental points for SiO2–O2-UV are indicated by closed red circles in Fig. 5(a)]. The rate of H2 formation is augmented by around 13.7%, from 24.7 to 28.1 μmol h−1.
This result suggests that oxygen-related defects are likely to play a key role in determining the activity of SiO2. It is recognized that catalytic performances are closely related to defect disorder of photoactive materials.57
The solar to hydrogen efficiency (STH) of the investigated materials, defined as the energy contained by evolved H2 divided by the energy input of simulated solar light AM 1.5, was calculated by using the following formula:58 STH = [ΔG0 × R(H2)]/(Pt × A)(1)where R(H2) is the rate of H2 formation (mol s−1), ΔG0 is the standard Gibbs energy of H2 at 25 °C and 1 bar (237.2 × 103 J mol−1), Pt is the power density (in our case 0.1 W cm−2) and A represents the illuminated area (4.5 × 4.5 cm2 in our experimental setup). The STH values for SiO2, SiO2–TiO2, TiO2 and SiO2–O2-UV are 0.08%, 0.001%, 0.05% and 0.09%, respectively. This result is remarkable because this evidences that bare SiO2 is 60% more efficient to produce solar energy compared to TiO2 P25.
The SiO2 insulator can be defined as a quantum photocatalyst because the excited states are localized and isolated from each other.59 Both oxygen-deficient and oxygen-excess defects in silica are optically active.60 Excess oxygen in silica has been predicted to exist as O2 interstitials, peroxy linkages, threefold configurations, and double bridges. Pristine SiOx is rich in peroxy linkages because their formation is energetically favored.61
The defect candidates accountable for the light absorption, photoluminescence and photocatalytic activity of SiO2 are dioxasilirane (),44 NBOHCs (nonbridging oxygen hole centers, Si–O˙),59,62 peroxy linkages (Si–O–O–Si, POLs), peroxy radicals (Si–O–O˙, PORs) and interstitial O2.63 Our experiments show that the increase in the surface density of oxygen-related defects has a positive impact on photocatalytic behavior both in terms of activity and stability. The formation of oxygen-excess defects (PORs, POLs, dioxasilirane, interstitial oxygen) is probed by the increased absorbance upon UV irradiation [see the SiO2_SPENT spectrum in Fig. 2(b)]. Mutual transformation of oxygen deficient centers, such as E′ centers (Si˙) and silylene (Si:), into NBOHCs (Si–O˙) and PORs (Si–O–O˙) is possible by reactions with O2.64 Thermal treatment of tubular SiO2 leads to the increase of ≈250 and ≈330 nm absorption peaks due to simultaneous formation of oxygen-deficient and oxygen-excess centers.20
3.1 Particularities of the photocatalytic mechanism on SiO2 and TiO2
Essential questions to be answered are: (i) why SiO2 is a better photocatalyst than TiO2 and (ii) what are the mechanistic particularities of H2 formation over an insulator (SiO2) and a semiconductor (TiO2)?
It is documented that ˙OH radicals are abundantly formed on the TiO2 surface by the reaction of valence band holes with adsorbed water, OH− or surface titanol groups.1 The ˙OH can be generated also by photogenerated electrons. The adsorbed O2 traps one electron to form O2− which further reacts with H+ and e− to yield H2O2 and finally ˙OH radicals.1 Water photolysis by UV light is another source of ˙OH (H2O + hν → ˙OH + ˙H).1
We have investigated first the ˙OH generation over SiO2, SiO2–TiO2 and TiO2 using fluorescein (FL) as the selective radical quencher.36 The zero order kinetics and equimolar reaction stoichiometry between ˙OH and FL were assumed. The calibration data in three points, presented in Fig. 6(a), show excellent correlation between the concentration of FL and the intensity of its photoluminescence (PL) at 515 nm (λex = 303 nm). The variation of PL intensity in the absence and presence of photocatalysts is shown in Fig. 6(b). The time course evolution of FL and ˙OH concentration is presented in Fig. 6(c) and (d), respectively.

Calibration of FL from photoluminescence measurement at 515 nm (λex = 303 nm) (a); evolution of fluorescein PL in time in the absence and presence of photocatalysts (b); FL consumption in time by ˙OH radicals (c); time course of ˙OH concentration (d). 
Within 15 min of irradiation, FL disappears on TiO2 due to the reaction with a large quantity of photogenerated ˙OH [see Fig. 6(c)]. The decay in time of FL on the SiO2–TiO2 composite is slower than on simple TiO2 but faster than in the test reaction (labeled FL). In contrast, the slowest decay of FL to its non-fluorescent form takes place on SiO2 [Fig. 6(c)]. This result indicates that ˙OH radicals are not formed over SiO2. The lower activity of SiO2 compared to that of the blank is because the screening effect of liquid-dispersed silica on incident light decreases the photolysis rate.1 The lack of ˙OH formation on SiO2 was confirmed previously.65 From the time dependence of ˙OH concentration, depicted in Fig. 6(d), the following order of activity is found: TiO2 ≫ SiO2–TiO2 > blank > SiO2. The evolution of FL concentration as well as the associated rate of ˙OH formation is presented in Table 1.

The order of the H2 output is SiO2 > TiO2 ≫ SiO2–TiO2 (negligible) [see Fig. 5(a)]. Corroboration of the photocatalytic test and ˙OH production results leads to the idea that the activity of TiO2 for H2 formation can be linked to the ˙OH generation rate. Fig. 5(b) reveals that the amount of photo-generated CO2 decreases in the order SiO2 ≫ SiO2–TiO2 ≥ TiO2. The largest quantity of CO2 is produced on SiO2 in spite of the absence of ˙OH. Therefore, the involvement of ˙OH in the CO2 formation mechanism should be excluded in the case of SiO2.
We have recently proposed a mechanism for TiO2-based photocatalysts, involving a complex radical and charge transfer pathways, for the formation of H2, oxidized intermediates and CO2 from a CH3OH/H2O mixture:66
The H2 formation cycle on TiO2: CH3OH + ˙OH → CH3O˙ + H2O(2) CH3O˙ + h+ → CH2O + H+(3) H+ + e− → 1/2H2(4)
The ˙OH is the most reactive ROS, being able to accept an electron from almost any molecule in its vicinity.67 It is known that TiO2 is one of the best ˙OH radical generators under UV irradiation.65 This fact is confirmed by ˙OH radical quenching results displayed in Fig. 6(b)–(d). The photocatalytic reaction begins with ˙OH attack leading to hydrogen abstraction from CH3OH and formation of a reactive methoxy radical (eqn (2)).1 It is well documented that alcohols are very efficient ˙OH quenchers.68 Then, the photogenerated h+ oxidizes CH3O˙ to CH2O (eqn (3)). Finally, the hydrogen formation cycle is closed by reduction of H+ to H2 by photoelectrons (eqn (4)). The succession of reactions (2)–(4), with participation of radicals (˙OH and CH3O˙), e− and h+ explains well the steady state formation of H2 over TiO2 [see Fig. 5(a)]. As can be seen in Fig. 5(b), the reaction pathways for CO2 formation are not important because the degradation probability of CH2O to CO2 is restricted by the negligible concentration of CH2O compared to CH3OH. Knowing that ˙OH radicals are not produced on SiO2, the next step of our investigation was to find pertinent reasons explaining its higher photocatalytic activity compared to TiO2 and the SiO2–TiO2 composite. We have demonstrated recently that tubular SiO2 can be an excellent photocatalyst in spite of the extra-large band gap of typical SiO2.20 The question is whether radical species are involved in the photocatalytic generation of H2 from the CH3OH–H2O mixture over SiO2.
Next, the formation of O2− superoxide ions over catalysts exposed to simulated solar light was studied. The reaction of XTT with O2− was monitored spectrophotometrically at 475 nm. The evolution of O2− in time in the absence (blank) and presence of oxide materials is presented in Fig. 7(a)–(d). The O2− is formed in measurable quantities within 210 min of irradiation neither on SiO2 [Fig. 7(b)] nor on TiO2 [Fig. 7(d)] but only on their composite, SiO2–TiO2 [see Fig. 7(c)]. The highly dynamic nature of molecular oxygen in amorphous silica under electrical bias was reported recently.63 Neutral interstitial O2 is the most stable in the form of peroxy linkages.61,69 Under electron injection (in our case photo-generated electrons) the interstitial O2 molecules can trap electrons with formation of oxygen ion defects in a double bridge configuration.63 The charged oxygen defects can easily diffuse through SiO2 with a low diffusion barrier of around 0.2 eV.63
 Fig. 7  The formation of O2− in the absence (blank) (a) and in the presence of SiO2 (b), SiO2–TiO2 (c) and TiO2 (d) under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm2) as calculated from the amount of reduced XTT (100 μM) at room temperature (particle concentration was 0.33 g L−1). 
The O2− acts as a weak oxidant in aqueous media and as a reducing agent in aprotic media, in the absence of proton donors.67 The low oxidation power of O2− is a pertinent explanation for the negligible photocatalytic activity shown by TiO2–SiO2.
An important finding is that the formation of ˙OH from O2− (˙O2− + 2H+ + e− → 2˙OH) is a minor reaction route in the case of TiO2 because the formation of O2− is not confirmed on this material. Thus, surface titanol groups of TiO2, OH− ions and water photolysis (H2O + hν → ˙OH + ˙H) are the most likely sources of ˙OH.1,70,71 The surface hydroxyls of TiO2 have been indicated to play an essential role in photodegradation reactions. They are the main source of reactive hydroxyl radicals, hinder electron–hole recombination and act as adsorption sites for organic reactants.1
The capacity of photocatalysts to produce singlet oxygen (1O2) was assessed using an SOSG selective marker. The calibration for SOSG concentration was carried out by measuring the absorption peak at 517 nm [Fig. 8(a)]. The good linearity of the calibration points in Fig. 8(a) confirms that the UV-vis method is appropriate to monitor the time course of SOSG concentration during the exposure of catalytic materials to light. The consumption of SOSG presented in Fig. 8(c) was determined from the photobleaching rate of the absorption maxima at 517 nm [see Fig. 8(b)].
 Fig. 8  The time evolution of 1O2 generated by AM 1.5 light photoexcited SiO2, SiO2–TiO2 and TiO2 using SOSG as a selective trapping reagent: calibration for SOSG concentration by measuring UV-vis absorbance at 517 nm (a), evolution in time of SOSG absorbance in the absence and presence of catalyst oxides (b), decrease of SOSG concentration in time, as a result of endoperoxide (SOSG-1O2) formation and of SOSG photodegradation, in the presence and absence of catalyst oxides (c), time course of PL intensity at 535 nm (λex = 488 nm), indicator of SOSG-1O2 formation (d), evolution of SOSG-1O2 concentration, indicator of oxygen singlet (e), and amount of SOSG degraded in time in the absence and presence of oxides (f). 
The variation of simple SOSG concentration during light exposure was unimportant. Over SiO2–TiO2, a small amount of SOSG is consumed in time to the formation of endoperoxide (SOSG-1O2). We have assumed that all the consumed SOSG in Fig. 8(c) was selectively transformed into SOSG-1O2 because SiO2–TiO2 shows negligible activity for methanol degradation [see H2 production in Fig. 5(a)]. This presumption allowed the quantitative determination of SOSG transformed into endoperoxide [Fig. 8(e)] and the degraded amount by non-selective reactions [Fig. 8(f)].

Fig. 8(c) reveals that the concentration of SOSG decreases rapidly in time over TiO2 in spite of the lack of 1O2 production [see Fig. 8(d)]. It comes out thus that ˙OH radicals are responsible for SOSG degradation over TiO2. Fig. 8(e) shows that an increase in the SOSG-1O2 level takes place even in the absence of photocatalytic materials. It is recognized that the decay of SOSG upon light exposure is a common drawback for most fluorescein-based sensors.72
When SOSG is illuminated with wavelengths below 600 nm, the fluorescence yield of SOSG increases similarly to that during exposure to 1O2.67 In contrast to TiO2, the decrease in SOSG concentration over SiO2 is due to simultaneous degradation and endoperoxide formation processes. Fig. 8(e) evidences that a larger amount of SOSG-1O2 is formed over SiO2 (≈0.12 μM in 15 min of irradiation) compared to the test reaction with simple SOSG but smaller than that over the SiO2–TiO2 composite (≈0.25 μM in the same period of time).
According to the experimental data displayed in Fig. 8(f), TiO2 is the most active in the degradation of SOSG (≈0.18 μM in 15 min) followed by SiO2 (≈0.13 μM in 15 min). The data plotted in Fig. 8(c) and (f) confirm that SOSG does not decay in the absence of photocatalysts (blank). The order of activity for conversion of SOSG after 15 min of light exposure, either by reaction with 1O2 or by photocatalytic degradation is: TiO2 (1.86 μM) > SiO2 (1.48 μM) ≫ SiO2–TiO2 (0.24 μM). Based on the results of 1O2 quenching by SOSG, the following observations can be made: (i) SiO2–TiO2 produces the largest amount of 1O2, (ii) degradation of SOSG over SiO2–TiO2 is negligible, (iii) over SiO2, SOSG is consumed both by degradation and by endoperoxide formation, (iv) 1O2 is not generated by TiO2-P25 and (v) SOSG is degraded by distinct reaction mechanisms over TiO2 and SiO2. In the case of TiO2, ˙OH radicals are responsible for the decay of SOSG whereas in the case of SiO2 the optically active oxygen-related surface defects account for the degradation of SOSG. From Fig. 8(e) and (f) it comes out that the consumed SOSG by endoperoxide formation and by degradation was ≈1.82, 1.45 and 0.25 μM for TiO2, SiO2 and SiO2–TiO2, respectively. Apparently, this would suggest a slightly better TiO2 photocatalyst for degradation of organic substrates than SiO2. On the other hand, we should keep in mind that the photo-oxidized methanol is not quantified in 1O2 trapping experiments, carried out in methanolic solutions. In fact, SiO2 is a better photocatalyst compared to TiO2 for methanol degradation as this is confirmed by the H2/CO2 generation rate from the water–methanol mixture (Fig. 5).
At ambient pressure and 0.1 W cm−2 excitation intensity, the generation rate of singlet oxygen (calculated for 0.001 g oxide material) is calculated to be 6.6 × 1016 (singlet-oxygen molecules) s−1 cm−3 for SiO2 and 1.6 × 1017 (singlet-oxygen molecules) s−1 cm−3 for TiO2–SiO2. In comparison, porous nanoSi excited at 0.1 W cm−2 was reported to yield ≈5 × 1020 (singlet-oxygen molecules) s−1 cm−3.73
The most important ROS involved in non-selective photodegradation of organic substrates is the ˙OH radical.67 The reactivity of the other ROS, 1O2 and O2−, is low compared with that of ˙OH. Supplementary tests were carried out to confirm the results of radical dosimetry presented above. The selective ˙OH quencher was coumarin (Merck). The reaction between coumarin and ˙OH radicals yields umbelliferone which has a PL emission band at 455 nm for an excitation wavelength of ≈330 nm.74,75 The PL spectra in Fig. 9 confirm the results obtained with fluorescein. Fig. 9 shows that ˙OH develops abundantly only on TiO2. The ˙OH presence was identified at the SiO2–TiO2 composite (see the PL peak at ≈470 nm) whereas on SiO2 the radical trapping experiments could not evidence the ˙OH formation. In the absence of ˙OH, we advanced the idea that the photoconversion of CH3OH on SiO2 takes place via a completely different reaction mechanism compared to that on TiO2, as described by eqn (8) and (9).
 Fig. 9  ˙OH radical trapping experiments with coumarin for TiO2, SiO2 and SiO2–TiO2 (λex = 330 nm). The samples (0.005 g) were suspended by ultrasonication in 5 μM solution of coumarin in water and exposed then to simulated solar light AM 1.5 for 10 min. 
The experimental results, performed on a multitude of tubular SiO2 materials developed in our laboratory, demonstrate that H2 is produced in large quantities upon exposure to solar light. Based on published data and on our experimental results (UV-vis, FTIR, XPS, selective radical quenching, identification of reaction intermediates), we hereby propose tentative, material-related mechanisms for ROS generation.

The case of SiO2. 
In our previous work we reported that the finger print photoluminescence of tubular SiO2 is characterized by two emission bands at 533 (2.3 eV) and 433 (2.9 eV) nm for λex = 320 and 340 nm.20 The ≈430 nm blue emission of photoexcited silica originates from the excited O2 state44 and the PL band at ≈530 nm is attributed to POR centers.76 Based on available information and on our experimental results, the following explanation for generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) on tubular SiO2 is advanced. The silylene in the ground singlet state with two unpaired electrons (ODC centers) is excited by light and is converted subsequently to the triplet state via intersystem crossing.46 The uptake of O2 in the triplet ground state (3O2) by excited silylene in the triplet state, leading to the formation of metastable dioxasilirane, activates 3O2 to the singlet state (1O2). The cleavage of 1O2 and return of silylene in the singlet ground state are associated with the observed blue light emission at 433 nm.20 The assumption of Anjiki et al.44 that the blue emission of defected SiO2 comes from the reversibly bound molecular oxygen to silica supports well the above-proposed mechanism for 1O2 formation. The 3O2 activation to 1O2 over SiO2 resembles earlier reports on the 1O2 formation mechanism mediated by electron-rich organic sensitizers such as fluorescein derivatives, dyes, porphyrins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.67 The particular structure of ODC defects explains why 1O2 is the only ROS formed under light irradiation over tubular SiO2.


The case of SiO2–TiO2. 
The formation of O2− superoxide radicals, observed only for SiO2–TiO2, is the result of cooperative interaction between SiO2 and TiO2. Photogenerated e− of semiconducting TiO2 is rapidly transferred to various molecular oxygen species attached to SiO2 such as dioxasilirane, peroxy radicals (PORs) and peroxy linkages (POLs).44,61 The weakly bound molecular oxygen in different ways to SiO2 shows absorption bands at λ > 300 nm [see Fig. 2(b)]. The best candidates responsible for the photoactivated uptake of O2 by SiO2 are E′ (Si˙) and silylene (Si:) defects.46 The absorption bands of oxygen deficient sites are visible at 214 (E′, as a weak shoulder) and 256 (silylene) nm in the UV-vis spectra of Fig. 2(b). The oxygen fixation processes can be described by the following equations:46,65,77 Si˙ + O2 → Si–O –O˙(5) (6) Si˙ ˙Si + O2 → Si–O–O–Si(7)
The weakly attached O2 to oxygen deficient centers (ODCs) of SiO2 (eqn (5)–(7)) are expelled as O2− species after rapid capture of photogenerated e− from TiO2 and regeneration of ODCs.
Explanation is needed to understand why the TiO2 coating on SiO2 produces a material with negligible photocatalytic activity, much lower than the individual components. According to the experimental data, the SiO2–TiO2 composite contains a high concentration of Si3+ (20.3 at%, Fig. 3e) and high yields under light irradiation O2−. The formation of superoxide species was observed neither on SiO2 nor on TiO2. In addition, the Ti2p maximum at 459.19 eV in the XPS spectrum of the SiO2–TiO2 composite in Fig. 3g, situated at greater binding energies than usual, indicates a decreased electron density at Ti atoms that can be explained by electron drainage at the silica–titania interface.78,79 The schematic representation in Fig. 10 explains the observed experimental facts.
 Fig. 10  Schematic representation of charge transfer at the SiO2–TiO2 interface. 
The photo-generated electrons, flowing from TiO2 to SiO2, are trapped at the interface formed between TiO2 and SiO2 either by Si4+ or by O2. The resulting Si3+ defects and O2− species were clearly put in evidence by XPS (see Fig. 3e) and radical quenching experiments (Fig. 7c). A high quantity of O2− is formed at the SiO2–TiO2 interface by reaction between the electrons supplied by TiO2 and adsorbed molecular O2. Recent studies confirmed that stable O2− is generated on oxide surfaces by a photo-induced electron transfer mechanism.80 In our case, photo-charges are impeded to participate in H2 and CO2 formation by the unfavorable consequences resulting from SiO2–TiO2 coupling, the electrons being trapped either by O2 or by Si4+. The SiO2–TiO2 composite exhibits limited deep oxidation efficiency but on the other hand shows good selectivity in mild oxidation reactions such as epoxidation of styrene or propene.81,82
To observe whether the activity of the composite can be boosted by adjustment of the SiO2/TiO2 ratio, we prepared a new material with a higher TiO2 content (0.8 mol%), to preserve the tubular morphology. We have observed only a slight increase in H2 (from 0.35 to 0.8 μmol h−1) and CO2 productivity (from 0.30 to 0.35 μmol h−1) when the TiO2 content in the composite is increased from 0.5 to 0.8 mol%. This experiment confirms the initial statement that SiO2 coated with TiO2 loses almost completely its photocatalytic activity for methanol conversion.


The case of TiO2. 
The photogenerated holes react with surface –OH groups of TiO2 to form the strongly oxidizing ˙OH radicals.1 The ROS trapping results gives essential answers to fundamental issues concerning the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds. The processes involved in H2 formation over TiO2, intermediated by ˙OH radicals, are described by eqn (2)–(4). For the SiO2–TiO2 composite, the titanol groups of TiO2 are the main ˙OH source. SiO2–TiO2 generates both oxygen species (O2− and 1O2) [Fig. 7(c) and 8(e)] but on the other hand shows negligible photocatalytic activity [0.3 μmol H2 h−1 and ≈2 μmol CO2 formed in 3 h of reaction (Fig. 5)]. This behavior is due to the low reactivity of 1O2 and O2− against CH3OH.67 The modest formation rate of ˙OH radicals over SiO2–TiO2 compared to TiO2-P25 (see Fig. 6 and Table 1) limits severely the photocatalytic activity of this composite. The surface photoactive sites of tubular SiO2, which may boost theoretically the activity of the composite, are blocked by the TiO2 phase coating. The tubular SiO2 produces only singlet oxygen as ROS. 1O2 is yielded also, but in lower amounts, by SiO2–TiO2.
The next step of our investigation was to understand why SiO2 shows excellent photocatalytic activity in the absence of ˙OH radical production (see Fig. 6). It is known that photoexcitation below the fundamental adsorption threshold of wide band gap solids yields excitons or free charges.83 Theoretically, this allows the wide band gap insulators to show activity in redox photocatalysis.84 In the case of the SiO2 insulator, the photogenerated charges are localized at excited sites and therefore cannot migrate to react with surface hydroxyl groups to yield ˙OH. The noteworthy performances of SiO2, in terms of activity and stability, cannot be explained as well by the 1O2 formation because these species possess weak oxidation ability.67 It comes out that the photocatalytic activation of methanol takes place on the surface active sites of SiO2 without significant interference of ROS. The NBOHCs are proposed to be the active sites in photometathesis of olefins and nonoxidative methane coupling.59,62 The photoexcitation by λ ≈ 258 nm light triggers electronic transition from the bonding orbital of Si–O to 2p nonbonding of nonbridging oxygen (Si–O˙ + hν → Si+–O:−). Assuming that NBOHCs are active sites, the following reaction mechanism is proposed: (8) H˙ + H˙ → H2(9)
A similar photo-activation mechanism can be imagined for other oxygen-related, optically active defects such as PORs (Si–O–O˙).
An attempt to evidence the formation of CH2O over SiO2 under simulated solar irradiation was carried out in separate experiments using a diluted solution of methanol (1000 ppm) in water. The dilution of CH3OH was necessary to achieve proper separation between CH2O and CH3OH chromatographic peaks. Aliquots of 5 μL solution were withdrawn every 30 min from the liquid phase of a tightly closed photoreactor and injected for analysis into a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A). The evolution of CH2O concentration in time over SiO2, presented in Fig. 11, shows a steady increase of CH2O product concentration in time. This experimental result validates the above proposed reaction mechanism. Besides CH2O, trace amounts of HCOOH were observed over SiO2. The same figure shows that TiO2 is less active in producing CH2O compared to SiO2. CH2O is the typical reaction product detected in the case of TiO2.85 The formation of CH2O over the SiO2–TiO2 composite was not confirmed experimentally, presumably because the concentration was below the detection limit of GC. This is an expected result since the photocatalytic activity of SiO2–TiO2 is negligible (i.e. ≈0.3 μmol H2 h−1).
 Fig. 11  Evolution in time of CH2O concentration in water–methanol solution containing the suspended photocatalysts exposed to simulated solar light AM 1.5. Reaction conditions: 0.015 g of SiO2, [CH3OH]initial = 1000 ppm, Vsol = 120 mL, T = 18 °C, tightly closed photoreactor. 
There are essential differences between the photoactivation mechanism of the organic substrate on TiO2 and on SiO2. In the case of TiO2, the photogenerated charges diffuse onto the surface and react with titanol groups and adsorbed O2 to form ˙OH and O2− radicals. The attack of strongly oxidizing ˙OH on methanol molecules, taking place on the surface and in the close vicinity of the catalyst, is followed by complex reaction sequences yielding finally H2 and CO2. An effective improvement would be to develop materials on which the formation of ˙OH does not take place. In the case of SiO2, the optically active sites are isolated from each other, with the photogenerated charges remaining confined on activation sites. The adsorbed methanol molecules interact with the surface-dispersed photoexcited sites of SiO2via the redox processes depicted by eqn (8) and (9). Thus, in contrast to TiO2, ROS are not involved in the activation of CH3OH over SiO2. Based on the H2 output and taking into account the significant differences in surface areas of the compared materials, the TOF (turn over frequency) values should be a few orders of magnitude higher on SiO2 compared to TiO2. The surface area of SiO2 is only 6 m2 g−1 whereas that of TiO2 is 55 m2 g−1. On TiO2, the overall reaction rate is hampered because the transfer of photogenerated charges to the organic substrate is slow because of intermediation by ˙OH. In contrast, on SiO2 the catalytic processes are driven by direct interaction between adsorbed CH3OH and surface quantum excited sites.

4. Conclusion
The important advancements reported for the first time in this paper concern photocatalytic and ROS generation activity of SiO2 with a tubular morphology, TiO2-coated tubular SiO2 and TiO2-P25. The results can be summarized as follows.
(i) The light harvested by optically active intraband gap lattice defects of highly strained SiO2 is able to trigger efficiently photocatalytic processes.
(ii) The formation of supplementary lattice defects upon exposure to UV light in the presence of O2 has a positive impact on the light absorbing characteristics and photocatalytic activity of SiO2.
(iii) The significantly better performances of SiO2 compared to those of standard TiO2-P25 and the SiO2–TiO2 composite in terms of H2 production is ascribed to highly active quantum photocatalytic sites.
(iv) The light-exposed SiO2 generates selectively only 1O2, with other ROS species being absent. The TiO2-P25 under AM 1.5 light irradiation produces exclusively ˙OH radicals. The O2− was identified solely on the SiO2–TiO2 composite. This composite produces also small amounts of ˙OH.
(v) Our results allowed deeper insight into the mechanism of photocatalytic reactions. The contribution of radicals to the overall reaction mechanism is ascertained now with greater precision. The ˙OH radicals have a predominant role in the photocatalytic activation of methanol over TiO2. In the case of SiO2, the surface optically active quantum defects are responsible for the observed photocatalytic activity. In this case, ROS are minor players in the reaction mechanism.
Research in progress now confirms that the density of SiO2 defects can be further augmented by appropriate chemical and physical procedures. Our results open broad prospects for practical applications of highly defected silica materials such as selective photooxidation of organic compounds and photodegradation of persistent pollutants. The SiO2 (possible also SiO2–TiO2), generating only 1O2 by photosensitization of 3O2, can be an excellent biologically active material. The photodynamic action of singlet oxygen comes from its high reactivity with biomolecules. New material chemistry based on silica is possible to develop in the future, comparable with carbon-derived graphene chemistry, which is actually of great interest. According to theoretical predictions, the highly defected silica-based materials show progressive transition from the insulator to semiconductor. Therefore, our strategy may be promising for obtaining a new class of robust, low cost semiconductors with broad spectra of applications.
