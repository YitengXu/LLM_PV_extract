Broader context
Gas involved reactions are essential components of energy conversion technology. Due to the multistep electron and mass transfer, the sluggish kinetics of the reactions leave plenty of room to develop cost-effective and high-performance catalysts to boost the energy conversion efficiency. As a unique 2D carbon nanomaterial with planar structure, uniformly distributed nanopores and large conjugated structure, GDY has shown fascinating properties such as an adjustable natural bandgap, ultrahigh charge carrier mobility, and outstanding conductivity. Herein, the current research progress of GDY-based catalysts for key gas involved reactions in energy conversion is summarized, including photocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis and electrocatalysis.

1. Introduction
Developing clean and renewable energy conversion technologies, such as fuel cells, water splitting, and carbon/nitrogen fixation, offers great potential towards addressing the current energy and environmental crisis.1–8 Gas involved reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), are believed to be the heart of these renewable energy conversion technologies. The sluggish kinetics of the aforementioned gas involved reactions, however, is a major limitation to achieve high performance, and therefore to develop efficient and robust catalysts to boost their reactivity is highly urgent.
Along with the intensive research efforts in nonprecious-metal counterparts to substitute noble-metal catalysts for renewable energy conversion technologies, carbon based catalysts have emerged as a new class of alternatives to reach low cost, high energy conversion efficiency and environmental friendliness.9–15 Different hybridization states of carbon atoms have already produced various carbon materials such as diamond (sp3), fullerenes (sp2), carbon nanotubes (sp2), and graphene (sp2). It has been demonstrated that sp2-hybrized graphene and carbon nanotubes, which possess π-conjugated structures, large surface area and excellent conductivity, enable a high percentage of exposed active sites and fast carrier transportation during the catalytic process.16–18 Apart from these extensively studied mono-hybridized carbon materials, one may wonder whether another carbon material consisting of two alternating hybridized states (sp and sp2) could exhibit unique catalytic properties.
Graphdiyne (GDY), inserting diacetylenic linkages (–CC–CC–) between two bonded carbons in graphene, is a novel allotrope of carbon.19–21 The sp- and sp2-hybridized two-dimensional network of GDY is a great breakthrough in the prevailing carbon materials.22–30 The unique structure endows GDY with a high degree of π-conjugation, uniform pores and excellent electrical conductivity. Density functional theory (DFT) indicates that GDY possesses a natural band gap (0.47–1.12 eV) and its charge carrier mobility (2 × 105 cm2 V−1) is distinguished and comparable to that of graphene.31,32 Most importantly, the porous structure of GDY makes the exposure of numerous active sites accessible and mass transport in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions kinetically efficient.
Another unique feature for GDY-based materials is their synthesis via a solution chemical method,33 which makes it convenient to control and optimize the dimensions, morphology and some physical–chemical properties, such as the bandgap, size of the pores and affinity with gas molecules. Furthermore, the introduced position and number of heteroatoms can be precisely controlled by changing the reaction conditions.34 The natural structural features and preparation advantages render GDY superior to other carbon materials and are beneficial for the improvement of catalytic activities for gas involved reactions.
To date, theoretical predictions and experimental studies have been achieved on GDY involving photocatalysts,35,36 electrocatalysts25 and photoelectrocatalysts37–40 for energy conversion. A timely review on such rapid growth is of interest to a broad range of scientific communities. In this review, the unique physical–chemical properties of GDY for gas involved catalytic reactions and some typical synthetic methods for the fabrication of GDY-based catalysts were firstly introduced. Then, the recent advances in GDY-based catalysts for the HER, OER, ORR, NRR and CO2RR were systematically discussed classified as “GDY based multicomponent catalysts and metal-free single-component catalysts” (Fig. 1). Finally, the challenges and prospects of GDY-based catalysts for energy conversion were comprehensively analyzed, which will enrich our knowledge on GDY for future energy conversion developments.

2. Unique properties of GDY for energy conversion and synthetic methods for GDY and GDY-based catalysts
In contrast to other carbon materials, the sp- and sp2-hybridized carbons in GDY lead to expanded pores, which offers GDY some unique physical–chemical properties, including the molecular structure and electronic properties. Moreover, GDY with desired dimensions, morphology and physical–chemical characteristics can be achieved by simply adjusting the reaction conditions. All these properties endow GDY with great potential in catalyzing gas involved reactions. Next, we will discuss this topic in detail.
2.1 Unique structure and physical–chemical properties of GDY
Graphyne is a collection of two dimensional carbon allotropes, which is constructed by inserting acetylenic linkages in graphene (Fig. 2a).41–43 Based on the different numbers of acetylenic linkages between benzene rings, GYs are denominated as graphyne (GY) (Fig. 2b), graphdiyne (GDY) (Fig. 2c), graphtriyne (GY-3) (Fig. 2d) and so on. Among all GYs, GDY is demonstrated as the most stable carbon allotrope containing acetylene linkages with a heat of formation of 18.3 kcal g−1.44 Therefore, GDY has been widely studied and employed in energy conversion. GDY consists of sp–sp2 co-hybridized carbon networks, including a central benzene ring and a butadiyne linker (Fig. 2c). Owing to the sp and sp2 co-hybridization, there are four types of carbon–carbon bonds in GDY: (1) Csp2–Csp2 bonds in the benzene rings; (2) Csp2–Csp bonds between benzene and CC triple bonds; (3) Csp–Csp triple carbon bonds; and (4) Csp–Csp single carbon bonds between the two CC bonds. The diverse carbon–carbon bonds in GDY provide stronger structural flexibility,45 which is beneficial to fabricate curved structures. Furthermore, the four kinds of carbon–carbon bonds synergistically lead to uniform pores in the 2D GDY plane. The diameter of the large ring is determined as 5.42 Å by theoretical calculations,46–48 which provides extra space for the diffusion of gas molecules. Most importantly, the uniform pores of GDY are favorable for the exposure of numerous accessible active sites and ensure that mass transport in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions is more kinetically efficient.

Compared to other carbon materials, the unique structural features of GDY result in some exclusive electronic structures, which are considered as key parameters in catalyzing gas-involving reactions. First-principles calculations showed that GDY possesses a natural band gap, which was quite different from graphene with a so-called gapless band structure. The band gap of GDY was determined to range from 0.46 to 1.22 eV, which depended on the utilized techniques and exchange–correlation function. For example, Shuai and co-workers indicated that GDY is a semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.46 eV;32 Luo and co-workers reported that the direct quasiparticle bandgap of GDY is 1.10 eV by using GW many-body theory;49 and Jiao and his co-workers proclaimed that GDY possesses a band gap of 1.22 eV.50 Notably, the band gap of GDY was greatly susceptible to strain,51 the ribbon width,52 nanotubes,53 the stacking mode,47 and applied electric fields.47 Another interestingly electronic property was that the GDY network possesses extremely high-speed charge transport. A single GDY nanosheet possessed a high electron mobility of 2 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a hole mobility of 2 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature.32 According to the above discussion, GDY is a semiconductor with a natural bandgap, proper electron distribution and good charge carrier mobility, in favor of its application in energy conversion.
2.2 Synthesis of GDY and its analogues
GDY was firstly synthesized on copper foil by Li's group via a cross-coupling reaction (Fig. 3a), in which Cu foil served as both the substrate and catalyst for the growth of GDY.33 Following the synthetic method, plenty of pioneering investigations were carried out aiming to enable the dimensions and morphologies of GDYs to be highly controllable. Various morphologies of GDY such as 0D nanoparticles,54 1D nanotubes (Fig. 3b),55 2D nanosheets (Fig. 3c),56 and 3D nanowalls (Fig. 3d),57 and sponge (Fig. 3e)58 were prepared for on-demand applications. In addition to Cu foil, the synthesis of GDY on other substrates was also achieved, such as copper foams,39,59,60 copper nanowires,61 anodic aluminum oxide,55 ZnO nanoarrays,62 graphene,63,64 diatomite,58 and Ag foil.65 Particularly, Gao et al. developed a Cu envelope assisted catalytic strategy, which achieved direct synthesis of GDY on arbitrary substrates.66 Additionally, some new methods for preparing GDY with only a few or single layers of nanosheets have also been demonstrated, including the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) coupling method,65 interfacial coupling method56 and van der Waals epitaxial strategy.63

Due to the strong chemical tailorability of the monomers of GDY, many new GDY analogues have been prepared through altering the structures of the aromatic units and the number of acetylene groups. For example, Li's group synthesized a novel carbon ene–yne (CEY) framework, which contains vinyl groups as the core units and a butadiyne moiety as the links.67 Because of the acceleration of vinyl groups for π-electron transportation, CEY exhibited excellent electronic properties and conductivity.68 Apart from changing the benzene rings, GDY analogues with different content of sp-hybridized carbon atoms were also obtained by changing the length of the alkyny linkage containing four69 or one70 acetylene groups.
On the basis of the above discussions, GDY and its analogues can be easily synthesized and modified, and controlled dimensions, morphology, and physical–chemical properties can be achieved just by adjusting the reaction conditions, which endows GDY with the necessary features to fabricate high-performance catalysts for energy conversion.
2.3 Synthetic methods for GDY-based catalysts
Up to now, extensive efforts have been made for the fabrication of various GDY-based catalysts for gas involved catalytic reactions. Due to the special structural features and preparation advantages, the fabrication of GDY based catalysts can be achieved by various routes. Next, we will introduce the synthetic methods of GDY based catalysts in detail including GDY-based multicomponent catalysts and GDY based metal-free single-component catalysts.

2.3.1 GDY based multicomponent catalysts. 
Compared to sp2 hybridized graphene, the sp- and sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in GDY could improve the affinity between GDY and catalysts, which endows GDY with great potential in fabricating multicomponent catalysts. The typical synthetic methods mainly involve a hydrothermal reaction (HT), oxidation–reduction (OR), π–π stacking, electrostatic assembly and direct growth. For HT and OR, GDY firstly interacts with the metal precursors, which are then treated by HT or OR to obtain the final catalysts. By using these methods, various hybrid materials, such as WS2/GDY,71 Mo2S/GDY,72 NiFe-LDH/GDY,73 TiO2/GDY,74 ZnO/GDY,75 NiCo2S4 NW/GDY,76 Co/GDY,77 Ni/GDY,78etc., have been synthesized.
In addition to the interaction with the precursors of catalysts, GDY can also interact with catalysts directly via π–π stacking and electrostatic assembly. The large π-conjugated structure of GDY offers the possibility to prepare GDY-based catalysts via π–π stacking between GDY and other π-conjugated catalysts. By using π–π stacking,37 Wu and Zhang et al. prepared a QD sensitized GDY photocathode after immersing a GDY film into a 4-mercaptopyridine functionalized QD colloid for 12 h. As another example, g-C3N4 was assembled onto GDY through π–π stacking interactions to construct a g-C3N4/GDY heterojunction.79
Due to the negatively charged surface of GDY, electrostatic assembly is also used to construct GDY-based hybrid catalysts. Yu's group prepared GDY coupled TiO2 nanofibers by an electrostatic assembly approach.80 In brief, TiO2 was firstly dispersed in water (pH = 4) to get a positively charged surface with a zeta potential of +15.1 mV, and then GDY with a negatively charged surface (−19.2 mV) was added to induce the electrostatic self-assembly process. Wu et al. treated GDY by air-plasma to introduce oxygen-containing functional groups, which led to a more negatively charged surface of GDY.39 After immersing in positively charged CoAl-LDH (+37.5 mV) for 6 h, a CoAl-LDH/GDY electrode with an intimate interface was successfully prepared via electrostatic assembly.
In addition, GDY could also grow on the surface of catalysts directly to improve the catalytic activity and stability. Gao et al. developed a Cu-envelope-assisted catalytic strategy to grow GDY on arbitrary substrates including 1D (Si nanowires), 2D (Au, Ni, and W foils, and quartz), and 3D (stainless steel mesh and graphene foam) substrates and they synthesized GDY on the surface of BiVO4 directly to facilitate photo-generated electron–hole separation. Li's group fabricated GDY encapsulated Cu nanowires61 and CoNx nanosheets81 as electrocatalysts for water splitting. Benefiting from the unique structure and close interactions between GDY and Cu nanowires or CoNx, the hybrid electrocatalysts showed increased numbers of active sites, enhanced charge transfer kinetics and improved conductivity.


2.3.2 GDY based metal-free single-component catalysts. 
Besides hybridization with other catalysts, doping with heteroatoms is another effective route to improve the catalytic performance of GDY, because more active sites, porous structures and defect edges can be formed. Heteroatom doped GDY can be obtained by heating GDY in an atmosphere with heteroatom sources, which is named “up-to-bottom” methods. By using this method, N-doped GDY,82,83 P-doped GDY84 and S-doped GDY85,86 have been prepared. Due to the coexistence of both sp and sp2-hybridized carbons, the doping sites of heteroatoms in GDY are complicated, either occurring in the benzene rings or in the acetylene bonds. However, in contrast to the inert benzene rings, some chemical reactions can occur with active acetylenic groups. Very recently, Zhao et al. introduced a new form of nitrogen doping moieties sp-hybridized nitrogen (sp-N) atoms into few-layer GDY (FLGDY) by a pericyclic reaction to replace the acetylene groups,87 which paves a new way for introducing heteroatoms in specific sites of GDY.
Obviously, the “up-to-bottom” method has drawbacks including uncertain doping sites, a disordered distribution and an uncontrolled doping amount of heteroatoms. To solve the problems, a controllable method, called a “bottom-to-up” route, was developed, in which new monomers containing heteroatoms are designed for the coupling reaction. By using the “bottom to up” method, some heteroatom doped GDYs were prepared controllably such as nitrogen,34 fluorine,88,89 chlorine,90 hydrogen,91,92 and boron93 doped GDYs. Due to the controlled doping sites and amount of heteroatoms, the conjugated skeletons of GDY are maintained and simultaneously some unique physical–chemical properties are generated.

3. GDY-based multicomponent catalysts for energy conversion
The unique π-conjugated structure of sp2- and sp-hybridized carbons endows GDY with large surface area, uniformly distributed pores, good chemical stability, and excellent charge mobility, which makes GDY hold great potential as additives to boost the catalytic activity for energy conversion. In the past few years, numerous studies on the application of GDY-based multicomponent catalysts for the HER, the OER, overall water splitting (OWS), the CO2RR, the ORR and the NRR have emerged. To clearly describe this, we will demonstrate the practical application of GDY based multicomponent catalysts based on its function in the multicomponent catalysts, including as photo-generated charge transfer materials and catalyst-support materials.
3.1 GDY as photo-generated charge transfer materials for photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic energy conversion
Photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) energy conversion using semiconductors has recently drawn much attention and the overall performance is determined by the generation, separation and transportation of photo-generated charges.94–101 However, the photo-induced holes and electrons in excited states easily recombine, which greatly limits the solar energy efficiency. To promote the separation of charge carriers and improve the conversion efficiency, combining semiconductors with carbon materials is considered as one of the most promising strategies due to their excellent physical and chemical properties.11,102 Owing to the large surface area, high carrier mobility, and tunable electronic band gaps, the recently emerged GDY is considered as a better assistant to facilitate the separation of photo-induced carriers, compared with other carbon substrates. In this part, we will introduce the recent progress of GDY as photo-generated charge transfer materials to boost the photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic HER, OER and CO2RR.

3.1.1 Hydrogen evolution reaction. 
The first application of GDY as a photo-induced charge transfer material was achieved by Wu's group. In this work, a CdSe QD/GDY photocathode was prepared via the π–π interactions between 4-mercaptopyridine functionalized CdSe QDs and GDY (Fig. 4a).37 Because the valence band potential of CdSe QDs (∼1.23 V vs. NHE) is more positive than that of GDY (∼1.05 V vs. NHE), the photogenerated holes from the QDs can be injected into GDY thermodynamically. Under 100 mW cm−2 Xe lamp illumination, the hybrid photocathode exhibited nearly −70 μA cm−2 photocurrent density at 0 V vs. NHE (Fig. 4b) and remained stable during a 12 h test with a faradaic efficiency of ∼95%. The superior performance was ascribed to the matched energy level and superior hole transfer ability of GDY, leading to fast extraction of photo-generated holes from the QDs to GDY and then to the counter electrode. Afterwards, g-C3N4/GDY photocathodes were prepared by immersing GDY in g-C3N4 solution.38 Benefitting from the excellent hole transfer ability of GDY and the strong interactions between GDY and g-C3N4, the hybrid photocathode showed a photocurrent density of −98 μA cm−2 at 0 V versus NHE (Fig. 4c), much larger than that of bare g-C3N4 (−32 μA cm−2 at 0 V vs. NHE). In addition, Bode phase plots indicated that the electron lifetime of g-C3N4/GDY heterojunctions realized a sevenfold increase compared to bare g-C3N4 (Fig. 4d), indicating that GDY could extract the photo-generated holes of g-C3N4 rapidly, thus preventing the recombination of photo-induced carriers.

In addition to PEC, GDY was also used for photocatalytic H2 evolution to promote charge separation. Owing to the relatively negative conduction band potential and simple synthesis steps, CdS nanoparticles have received a great deal of attention.104,105 However, CdS nanoparticles are usually inclined to aggregate and suffer from severe recombination of photo-generated carriers during the photocatalytic process, which leads to decreased photocatalytic activity and stability. Lu's group successfully prepared a CdS/GDY heterojunction by a facile hydrothermal method (Fig. 4e),35 which showed much higher activity than that of bare CdS nanoparticles and GDY. When the GDY content was 2.5 wt%, the CdS/GDY hybrids exhibited the best performance with a mass activity of 4.1 mmol g−1 (Fig. 4f). Such an enhancement was derived from the formed CdS/GDY heterojunction, where GDY could not only facilitate the dispersity of CdS nanoparticles but also act as a hole transfer material to promote the separation of photo-generated carriers.
Recently, Cui et al. applied γ-GY, a kind of GDY analogue with one alkyny linkage between the two benzene rings, to fabricate a heterojunction with TiO2 for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.103 Compared to bare TiO2, the TiO2/γ-GY samples exhibited much better activity and the optimized sample with 5% γ-GY could generate 77.6 μmol H2 after 4 hours of irradiation, which was nearly an 8.4-fold increase over that of pure TiO2 (Fig. 4g). Such an improvement was attributed to the formation of the TiO2/γ-GY heterojunction, which can not only extend the absorption to visible light but also facilitate the separation of photo-generated carriers during the photocatalytic process (Fig. 4h).


3.1.2 Oxygen evolution reaction. 
Except for hydrogen evolution, GDY was also introduced into photoelectrocatalytic and photocatalytic oxygen evolution. With a proper band gap of 2.4 eV and excellent light absorption depth, BiVO4 is considered as one of the promising photoanode materials, but it still suffers from high electron–hole recombination and poor water oxidation kinetics.106–111 Wu and Zhang et al. synthesized GDY nanowalls on the surface of BiVO4 photoanodes by a Cu-envelope-assisted catalytic strategy,66 in which GDY acted as a hole transfer layer to facilitate the separation of photo-generated carriers (Fig. 5a). Compared to bare BiVO4, the GDY/BiVO4 photoanode exhibited an enhanced photocurrent density of ∼1.32 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and the performance was further improved to 2.03 mA cm−2 after deposition of CoPi co-catalysts. The GDY/BiVO4 photoanode remained stable during a 4 h test, which was ascribed to the fast extraction of photo-induced holes to participate in the water oxidation instead of the oxidation of BiVO4 itself. Very recently, their group fabricated a superhydrophilic GDY/BiVO4 photoanode by air-plasma treatment and then ultrathin CoAl-LDH nanosheets as co-catalysts were assembled onto the surface by electrostatic interactions.39 Compared to the hydrophobic one, the superhydrophilic CoAl-LDH/GDY/BiVO4 electrode showed a much larger photocurrent of ∼3.15 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5b) and a photo-conversion efficiency of ∼0.63%. Mott–Schottky experiments indicated that the plasma treatment and CoAl-LDH assembly had little effect on the charge carrier density (Fig. 5c) and DFT calculations revealed that the enhancement of the performance was mainly ascribed to the accelerated interfacial mass/electron transportation by superhydrophilic GDY.

Semiconductor silicon with a narrow bandgap, which is very economic and easily available, has been widely used as the photo-electrodes in PEC cells.112–114 However, the sluggish surface reaction and severe photo-corrosion pose a challenge for their practical application. Under this consideration, Zhang's group introduced GDY and NiOx nanoparticles into the top of a Si heterojunction (SiHJ) for hole transfer facilitation and as co-catalysts, respectively (Fig. 5d).40 Benefiting from the synergistic effects between GDY and NiOx particles, the SiHJ/GDY/NiOx-10 nm photoanode exhibited a saturated photocurrent density of 39.1 mA cm−2, much larger than those of bare SiHJ and SiHJ/NiOx (Fig. 5e).
With a valence band potential of ∼2.85 V, Ag3PO4 exhibits good activity in photocatalytic oxygen evolution.115 However, the severe photocorrosion of Ag3PO4 limits the photocatalytic activity and stability as a recyclable photocatalyst. To solve this problem, Mao et al. fabricated a Pickering emulsion structure, in which Ag3PO4 acted as a photocatalyst with GDY as the hydrophobic nanostructure.36 Due to the low work function, highly conjugated structure, and high electron mobility of GDY, the Ag3PO4/GDY-based emulsion exhibited the best performance for oxygen evolution, which was nearly 1.89 and 1.75 times higher than that of the Ag3PO4/CNT and Ag3PO4/graphene based emulsions, respectively (Fig. 6b). The improvement was ascribed to the multiple functions of GDY in acting as a reducing agent to reduce Ag+ to Ag0, an acceptor of the photo-generated electrons from Ag3PO4 nanoparticles and a hole transfer mediator to facilitate the hole transportation (Fig. 6a).

3.1.3 Carbon dioxide reduction reaction. 
The aggravation of fossil fuels and continuous CO2 emission have caused increasing energy shortage and environmental pollution. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction into chemical fuels driven by solar energy is considered as one of the promising solutions to address the above issues.116–118 Yu's group, for the first time, prepared TiO2/GDY photocatalysts for CO2 reduction via a facile electrostatic self-assembly method.80 First-principles calculations and in situ XPS measurements indicated that the delocalized electrons in GDY can hybridize with the empty orbitals in TiO2, leading to an internal electric field (IEF) at the interfaces, which would promote the charge carrier separation remarkably (Fig. 6c). DFT calculations further implied the strong chemisorption and deformation of CO2 molecules on GDY, hence contributing to the photo-reduction process. These effects combined with the photothermal effect of GDY resulted in a significantly improved CO2 photoreduction efficiency compared with bare TiO2. The CO production was significantly improved with increased content of GDY and reached a maximum rate of 50.53 μmol h−1 g−1 for TG0.5 (Fig. 6d). In contrast, the production rate of CH4 just increased slightly, indicating the remarkable selectivity of GDY towards CO (Fig. 6d). This work demonstrates the great potential of GDY in catalyzing CO2 reduction.

3.2 GDY as catalyst-support materials for electrocatalytic energy conversion
Development of highly efficient electrocatalysts is the heart of renewable energy technology.119–122 Polymer binders, such as Nafion, are usually used to stabilize electrocatalysts on the electrodes, which will generate additional resistance and block the catalytic centers to a large extent. To address these problems, it is rational to integrate these electrocatalysts with freestanding carbon substrates. In the following part, the recent progress of GDY supported electrocatalysts for the HER, the OER, OWS, the ORR and the NRR is summarized (Table 1).

3.2.1 Hydrogen evolution reaction. 
Electrocatalytic water splitting into H2 is considered as an efficient, environment-friendly, and sustainable strategy for large-scale H2 production. The HER occurs at the cathode in water electrolysis, which possesses natural advantages to meet future energy demand due to the rich source of water and zero greenhouse gas emission. Given the distinctive electronic structure, high conductivity, and strong chemical stability, GDY has been widely used as excellent supports for the fabrication of electrocatalysts. Next, we will summarize the progress of GDY-based electrocatalysts for the HER.
3.2.1.1 Supporting transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). 
Low-cost and earth-abundant TMDs such as WS2, MoS2, etc. recently have been considered as alternatives to replace noble Pt for the HER.123–125 Because the catalytically active sites of van der Waals compounds are usually located in the edge sites instead of the basal plane,126 plenty of effort has been made to prepare monolayer and quantum dot types to expose their edge sites.127–129 However, their instability and poor conductivity have limited their potential use and thus foreign supports have to be adopted to improve the stability and conductivity.
Liu's group developed a GDY/WS2 composite by in situ growth of WS2 onto GDY nanosheets via a solvothermal reaction (Fig. 7a).71 It is found that GDY could prevent the WS2 from aggregating and at the same time improve the electronic conductivity. In contrast to bare WS2, the resultant GDY-WS2 2D hybrid catalysts exhibited much better electrocatalytic activity with a lower onset potential of ∼140 mV and Tafel slope of 54 mV dec−1. This work provided meaningful information to develop a wide range of GDY based 2D layer materials for energy conversion.

Afterwards, Li's group fabricated a 3D porous MoS2/N-GDY heterostructure, where the N-doped GDY provided the porous structure and excellent conductive network for the growth of MoS2 nanosheets (Fig. 7b).130 To reach a 10 mA cm−2 current density, the MoS2/N-GDY composites only required an overpotential of ∼186 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, much lower than those of MoS2/GDY, MoS2/GDY oxide, pure MoS2, NGDY and GDY (Fig. 7c and d). The superior HER activity of MoS2/NGDY was mainly due to the increased number of exposed active sites and the intimate interactions between MoS2 and N-doped GDY, which could enhance the conductivity and facilitate the charge transfer efficiently.
Previous findings indicated that the direct growth of MoS2 on a conductive substrate cannot prevent the loss of sulfur in the catalytic process, which drastically decreases the activity and stability.132 Coating the catalyst with a carbon layer seems to be a convenient method to solve this problem. Li's group prepared a novel 3D GDY-MoS2 heterostructure by coating ultrathin GDY nanosheets on MoS2 nanosheet arrays through a hydrothermal method coupled with a cross-coupling reaction.131 DFT calculations revealed that the incorporation of ultrathin GDY nanosheets can enormously decrease ΔGH (from 1.94 to 0.78 eV), compared with pristine MoS2, which was beneficial for H adsorption (Fig. 7e and f). The GDY-MoS2 NS/CF electrode showed excellent HER activity with an overpotential of ∼115 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 (Fig. 7g), which is better than that of the above MoS2/N-GDY and comparable to most of the benchmark electrocatalysts. Moreover, GDY-MoS2 NS/CF also displayed strong stability with no degradation after 6000 successive operations.
3.2.1.2 Supporting metal nanoparticles and single atoms. 
Metal nanoparticles are a class of promising catalysts for the HER, but they tend to aggregate due to the high-surface energy, resulting in a dramatic decrease in performance.18,133,134 Therefore, it is necessary to seek suitable supporting materials to protect metal nanoparticles from aggregation through the strong interactions between them. Li et al. prepared hybrid electrocatalysts (denoted as CoNC/GDY) for the HER,77 in which cobalt nanoparticles were supported by GDY and wrapped by an N-doped carbon layer (Fig. 8a). The size distribution of the Co NPs exhibits a most probable diameter of ∼7.58 nm (Fig. 8b) and the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Co 2p features two peaks at 777.9 and 793.4 eV (Fig. 8c), assigned to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 orbitals of Co, respectively. The CoNC/GDY electrode showed excellent HER activity in 1 M KOH with an overpotential of ∼170 mV, much lower than those of bare GDY (700 mV), NC/GDY (300 mV) and Co/GDY (260 mV). Most importantly, the hybrid electrocatalysts functioned well regardless of pH and even remained relatively stable after 38000, 9000 and 36000 cycles under acidic, neutral and basic environments, respectively. The superior performance stemmed from the strong interactions between the alkyne ring of GDY and Co NPs, which could suppress the aggregation of Co NPs and at the same time improve the electron transfer ability.

Beyond metal NPs, single-atom catalysts (SACs), which could maximize the utilization of metal atoms, are considered as the most promising way to achieve high catalytic activity with cost-efficient catalysts.135–137 Because the increasing surface free energy with reduced metal-particle size makes the SACs easily migrate and aggregate into metal clusters, it is imperative to search for a firm support to stabilize single atoms steadily.138–140 The migration barrier of graphene-supported metal atoms has been reported as 0.2–0.8 eV. Such low values cannot prevent the migration of SACs even at ambient temperature, indicating that pristine graphene is not an ideal substrate for SACs.141 Unlike graphene, the sp hybridized carbons in GDY enable the arbitrary angle rotation of π/π* perpendicular to the axis, making it possible for it to point toward metal atoms and chelate a single metal atom.142–144 Thus, GDY could serve as an ideal support for SACs without any pretreatment and provide a better opportunity to fabricate stable SACs.
As shown in Fig. 8d, there are three possible adsorption sites for SACs in GDY: (i) the center of the acetylenic ring (S1); (ii) the corner of the acetylenic ring (S2); and (iii) the hexatomic ring (S3).144 When the metal atom is located at S1, the atom would move to the corner (S2) automatically after optimization, which indicates that S1 is not stable for SACs. For S3, the metal atoms would locate on the top of the carbon ring. In this location, the metal atoms cannot be efficiently anchored and will be easily desorbed from GDY because of the weak van der Waals forces. Therefore, the most stable configuration is S2. The binding energies of different metal atoms (from Sc to Zn and Pt) on a single GDY layer were calculated (Fig. 8e). Apart from Zn atoms, all the binding energies are negative, implying the strong chemisorption character between the TM atoms and the GDY substrate.
Xue et al. reported the preparation of stable single-atom Ni(0) and Fe(0) on GDY by an electrochemical reduction method.78 Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM images identified narrow size distributions of both Ni and Fe mainly around 1.23 and 1.02 Å, in line with Ni and Fe single-atoms (Fig. 8f and h). Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) further confirmed that the Ni and Fe existed predominantly as isolated atoms instead of clusters (Fig. 8g and i). The GDY-supported SACs exhibited excellent electro-catalytic activity and long-term stability under acidic conditions, even better than those of most state-of-the-art HER catalysts. Such superior HER activity was ascribed to the strong chemical interactions and electronic coupling between GDY and the single-atom Ni/Fe, which facilitated the charge transportation from catalytically active sites to GDY. Afterwards, they synthesized zero-valent palladium atoms supported on GDY.145 HAADF-STEM and EXAFS confirmed the existence of single atom Pd (Fig. 8j and k). Theoretical calculations indicated the existence of strong p–d coupling effects between the Pd single atoms and the alkynyl carbon in GDY, which led to facile adsorption of H atoms and lowered the reaction energy barrier for the HER. As expected, the Pd0/GDY electrode exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity with a lower overpotential, higher turnover frequency and better stability than those of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C.
For SACs, the electronic structures of metal atoms are greatly influenced by the coordination environments, thus affecting the catalytic activity.146–148 Lu's group synthesized two types of Pt SACs on GDY labelled Pt-GDY1 and Pt-GDY2 with different Pt coordination environments (Fig. 9a).149 Pt-GDY1 was five-coordinated C1-PtCl4 species and Pt-GDY2 was four-coordinated C2-Pt-Cl2 species. Pt-GDY2 showed better HER activity with a mass activity up to 3.3 and 26.9 times higher than PtGDY1 and commercial Pt/C catalysts, respectively (Fig. 9b). Such activity of Pt-GDY2 was ascribed to the higher total unoccupied density of states of Pt 5d orbitals (Fig. 9c) and the near to zero value of the Gibbs free energy (Fig. 9d). This work provides a deep understanding of structure–catalytic activity relationships for SACs.

3.2.2 Oxygen evolution reaction. 
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), also called water oxidation, is considered as the major barrier of overall water splitting because of the inactive four-proton-coupled electron transfer and uphill kinetic energy.150–153 GDY possesses multiple features, such as a highly π-conjugated structure, large surface area, natural pores, good chemical stability, and excellent electronic conductivity, making it of great potential to construct OER catalysts.
3.2.2.1 Supporting metal nanoparticles. 
In term of the strong interactions between alkyne π-conjugated GDY and metal ions, Wu and Zhang et al. reported a self-supported 3D Cu@GDY/Co electrode for the OER,60 in which Cu foam was used as a substrate to support the GDY and then Co nanoparticles were loaded on GDY via a facile chemical reduction of the Co2+ salt precursor (Fig. 10a). The diameter of the Co particles was ∼4 nm, which ensured sufficient exposure of the catalytically active sites. The as-prepared electrode exhibited high OER activity in 0.1 M KOH with a small overpotential of ∼0.3 V and a large unit mass activity of 413 A g−1 at 1.60 V vs. RHE (Fig. 10b), which benefit from the synergistic effect between Co nanoparticles, GDY, and 3D Cu foam. In addition, the electrode maintained a stable current density during 4 h electrolysis. This work evidenced the great potential of GDY to stabilize metal nanoparticles for the OER.

3.2.2.2 Supporting layered double hydroxides. 
Due to the layered and open structure, two dimensional (2D) layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been considered as one of the most promising low-cost electrocatalysts for the OER.155–159 However, the inherent relatively low conductivity of LDHs seriously impedes the electron transfer, and becomes the main obstacle for further improving the activity for the OER. Anchoring LDHs on conductive substrates is believed to be an effective way to resolve the above-mentioned impediments.160 The rising-star sp/sp2 co-hybridized carbon network of GDY would be a promising support material for LDH anchoring.
Yuan et al. synthesized NiFe-LDH on GDY directly (denoted as GDY@NiFe) via the electrodeposition method to facilitate electron transfer (Fig. 10c).73 Compared to bare NiFe-LDH, the resultant GDY@NiFe electrode achieved enhanced OER activity with an overpotential of ∼260 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH and good stability during 6 h electrolysis at 1.52 V vs. RHE. Such enhancement mainly originated from the increased active surface area and improved conductivity. Kuang et al. constructed a hybrid GDY/NiFe-LDH by a facile hydrothermal method and compared the OER performance of GDY/NiFe-LDH, RGO/NiFe-LDH (RGO: reduced graphene oxide) and CNT/NiFe-LDH (CNT: carbon nanotube).154 GDY/NiFe-LDH exhibited the best OER activity with an overpotential of nearly 260 mV at a 10 mA cm−2 catalytic current density in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 10d). DFT calculations proved that the superior activity results from the excellent electron capture and transfer ability of GDY compared to RGO and CNTs (Fig. 10e). This work further confirms the great potential of GDY to boost the activity of OER catalysts.
Recently, Wu and Zhang's group modified the surface wettability of GDY from hydrophobic to hydrophilic via air-plasma treatment.39 Ultrathin CoAl-LDH nanosheets as catalysts were assembled onto the superhydrophilic GDY by electrostatic interactions. Compared to the hydrophobic one, the as-prepared superhydrophilic CoAl-LDH/GDY electrode exhibited much better OER activity with an overpotential of ∼258 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 10f) and the turnover frequency (TOF) is calculated to be ∼0.60 s−1 at an overpotetnial of 300 mV. DFT calculations revealed that superhydrophilic GDY had stronger interactions with CoAl-LDH and attracted H2O molecules around the catalysts, which thus facilitated interfacial mass/electron transportation. These results indicate that superhydrophilic GDY is promising to boost oxygen evolution by promoting interfacial mass/electron transportation.


3.2.3 Overall water splitting. 
From a practical application perspective, the electrocatalysts for the HER and OER should be used under the same conditions to achieve overall water splitting efficiently.161–165 However, most of the effective catalysts in acidic environments are not active and stable in alkaline environments, and vice versa. It has been noted above that GDY exhibits excellent tolerance to harsh operational conditions and remains stable in a large range of pH (0–14) environments, which makes it promising to fabricate bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.
Xue et al. reported the first GDY based bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, where 3D graphdiyne foam provided scaffolds for the growth of NiCo2S4 nanowires (denoted as NiCo2S4 NW/GDF).76 The resultant NiCo2S4 NW/GDF showed outstanding catalytic activity and stability for both the OER and HER in alkaline media. Notably, the corresponding two-electrode water electrolyzer achieved efficient overall water splitting at very low cell voltages of 1.53 and 1.56 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and 20 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 11d), and long-time stability over 140 h electrolysis performed at 20 mA cm−2.

Li's group fabricated a bifunctional electrocatalyst of ultrathin GDY-enwrapped iron carbonate hydroxide nanosheets (FeCH@GDY/NF) through a two-step strategy for efficient overall water splitting (Fig. 11e).166 Such an electrocatalyst can drive overall water splitting efficiently in an alkaline electrolyzer with an overpotential of ∼260 mV and ∼300 mV at a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, and remained stable even after 25 h electrolysis. All the results confirmed the decisive role of GDY in designing cost-effective, efficient, and stable electrocatalysts for sustainable overall water splitting.
Afterwards, their group constructed GDY encapsulated cobalt nitride nanosheets (CoNx@GDY NS) via an in situ growth method (Fig. 11f).81 Benefiting from the unique chemical and electronic structure and associated interactions between GDY and CoNx, the electrocatalyst exhibits greatly enhanced conductivity, promoted charge transfer kinetics and increased numbers of active sites. When used both as an anode and cathode for OWS in an alkaline environment, a very low cell voltage of 1.48 V is required to reach 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 11g). This work describes the high performance of bifunctional CoNx@GDY NS/NF, which can be used as an efficient and cost-effective noble-metal-free electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.
Recently, Hui et al. synthesized GDY-sandwiched ultrathin iron–cobalt LDH nanosheets (denoted as e-ICLDH@GDY/NF) by a GDY-induced intercalation/exfoliation method (Fig. 11a).167 The larger interlamellar spacing and high ion exchange capacity of Fe/Co-LDH (ICLDH) permit the precursor of GDY (hexaethynylbenzene (HEB)) to enter its gallery, which is propitious to form GDY on both sides of ICLDH. Meanwhile, the stress/deformation brought about by the close contact between ICLDH broadened the interlayer spacing, thereby resulting in the complete exfoliation of bulk ICLDH into ultrathin nanosheets to form 2D/2D e-ICLDH@GDY. In contrast to inactive bulk-LDHs, the e-ICLDH@GDY/NF electrode had the following superiorities: (i) the inherently high electroconductivity of GDY can greatly accelerate the charge transfer and enhance the catalytic kinetics and activity, offsetting the shortcoming of Fe/Co-LDH of low conductivity; (ii) GDY possessed numerous triple bonds, rendering it abundant in charged carbon atoms, serving as active sites; and (iii) GDY can protect ICLDH from corroding and improve the stability. When assembling e-ICLDH@GDY/NF into a two-electrode electrolyzer, the bifunctional electrocatalyst only required a low overpotential of ∼0.2, 0.23, and 0.26 V to reach a 10, 100, and 1000 mA cm−2 current density, respectively (Fig. 11b). Theoretical calculations indicated that the transition state barriers of intermediate H2O-splitting were 0.28 eV (e-ICLDH@GDY), 0.44 eV (ICLDH), and 0.65 eV (GDY), respectively, indicating the most feasible route for e-ICLDH@GDY (Fig. 11c).


3.2.4 Oxygen reduction reaction. 
The ORR, an essential step in fuel cells and metal–air batteries, requires efficient electrocatalysts to obtain fast reaction kinetics for practical applications. Metal-based catalysts, especially Pt based materials, are considered as the most favorable catalysts.168–170 By tuning the size of the catalyst particles to the nanoscale and even to single atoms, the exposed active sites and electronic conductivity could be greatly improved. The above discussion has shown that alkyne and aryl π-conjugated GDY is an excellent substrate to stabilize metal atoms against aggregation. In this part, we will focus on the progress of GDY supported metal nanoparticles or single atoms for the ORR.
Taking advantage of the strong bonding effect between GDY and metal atoms, Fe nanoparticles were stabilized by N-rich GDY by Huang's group, in which FeCl3 and melamine were used as the Fe source and N source, respectively (Fig. 12a).171 Among all of the Fe-N-GDY catalysts, 1.5% Fe-N-GDY displayed the best activity for the ORR in 0.1 M KOH (Fig. 12b), which is even comparable to commercial Pt/C. By using a similar method, their group recently reported the synthesis of Co nanoparticles supported on N-rich GDY and the optimized 1% Co-N-GDY also displayed comparable activity with commercial Pt/C for the ORR.174

Wang et al. reported a facile strategy to anchor Pd nanoparticles on an N-rich GDY surface (denoted as CNx-Pd@GDY) via pyrolysis methods.172 The as-prepared CNx-Pd@GDY catalyst exhibited an onset potential of 0.96 V vs. RHE and a limited current density up to ∼5.2 mA cm−2 in alkaline medium, comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (Fig. 12c). More importantly, it showed impressive stability after 5000 cycles of CV. The excellent performance of CNx-Pd@GDY was ascribed to the good interaction between Pd and GDY, which can not only protect the Pt nanocrystals from detachment, dissolution, migration and aggregation, but also facilitate electron transfer due to the three-dimensional structure of GDY.
By combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) predictions and experimental validation, Gao et al. verified that GDY supported single atom Fe (Fe-GDY) was an outstanding catalyst for the ORR (Fig. 12d).173 Adsorption energy (Ead) calculations revealed that the anchored Fe atoms were active sites and possessed a stronger interaction with the ORR intermediates (*OOH, *O, and *OH) than that of the sp2 hybridized carbon atoms or the sp hybridized carbon atoms. To validate the theoretical predictions, they synthesized single Fe-GDY catalysts experimentally by in situ reducing adsorbed Fe3+ on GDY using NaBH4 as a reducing reagent. Fe-GDY exhibited an onset potential of 0.21 V, a half-wave potential of 0.10 V, a kinetic current density of 6.70 mA cm−2, and a rate constant of 1.47 × 10−5 in 0.1 M KOH, which were equal or even superior to the 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst (0.20 V, 0.10 V, 6.40 mA cm−2, and 1.40 × 10−5) (Fig. 12e). In addition, Fe-GDY showed a high 4e− selectivity instead of 2e− for the ORR, in line with the DFT predictions. This work paves a new way to develop GDY-based single-atom catalysts for highly efficient ORR.


3.2.5 Nitrogen reduction reaction. 
Ammonia (NH3), the nitrogen source of the agricultural industry as well as other industries, is regarded as the synthetic building blocks of manufacturing synthetic chemicals.175 However, the traditional Haber–Bosch method possesses several shortcomings, such as the huge exogenous energy input, low conversion efficiency of 10–15% from N2, large greenhouse gas emission (exceeding 1%), and severe synthesis conditions. Searching for clean energy as the driving force for N2 fixation is highly urgent. The electrochemical NRR from N2 and H2O under mild conditions is a promising method,176–179 because it can achieve sustainable and high-yield NH3 production powered by solar-produced electric energy.
Very recently, Li and his coworkers prepared zerovalent molybdenum atom catalysts supported by GDY (Mo0/GDY) for the electrocatalytic NRR with a high mass content of Mo atoms (up to 7.5 wt%).180 Theoretical calculations indicated that Mo sites were active sites. The active Mo sites transferred charge and modified the charge distribution from the C sites, serving as electron rich centers for active electron transfer and bonding for steady adsorption for the NRR (Fig. 13a). The NRR performance of Mo0/GDY increased with the increase of the negative potential, and Mo0/GDY exhibited the highest NH3 yield rate (YNH3) at −1.2 V vs. SCE in 0.1 M Na2SO4 (Fig. 13b). With a further increase in the negative potential, YNH3 decreased rapidly, which revealed that the NRR dominates at low negative potentials, whereas the HER becomes dominant at more negative potentials. At a potential of −1.2 V vs. SCE, YNH3 of the Mo0/GDY electrocatalyst was located in the range of 113.4–145.4 μg h−1 mgcat.−1, and the faradaic efficiency changed from 15.2% to 21.0% (Fig. 13c), which was comparable to the benchmark electrocatalysts. No other nitrogen-containing material such as hydrazine (N2H4) was detected, revealing the high selectivity towards NH3. XPS spectra, XAFS spectra, and HAADF-STEM images showed that Mo atoms still existed in the zero-valence state and were uniformly distributed on the GDY surface after the NRR, suggesting the excellent stability of the Mo0/GDY composites. In addition, Mo0/GDY showed superior electrocatalytic performance in 0.1 M HCl with an NH3 yield rate of 2.0 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.1 V (Fig. 13d). The work implied that GDY based catalysts hold great prospects for the NRR.

4. GDY based metal-free single-component catalysts for energy conversion
Carbon based metal-free catalysts have recently received great attention owing to their inherent stability, low price, and sustainability.12–15 Because of the chemically inert surfaces of carbon materials, some modifications are necessary to optimize the electronic properties. Doping with heteroatoms can effectively break the electrical neutrality and introduce catalytic sites. Some doped carbon materials, such as N-doped graphite,181 N-doped graphene,182 and N-doped nanotubes,183 have exhibited improved catalytic activity for energy conversion. The unique structure of GDY can be modulated after doping, leading to higher activity towards energy conversion. In addition, the strong chemical tailorability of the alkynyl-containing monomers makes it feasible to replace the skeleton of GDY by other functional alkynyl frameworks. Many GDY analogues have been prepared by changing the structures of the aromatic units and the number of acetylene groups, which leads to different physical–chemical properties from GDY, including the molecular structure and electronic properties. In this section, we will summarize the recent developments in GDY based metal-free single-component catalysts for photocatalytic, electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic energy conversion.
4.1 Photoelectrocatalytic and photocatalytic energy conversion
As mentioned above, developing efficient photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts is a sustainable technology for producing green fuels from solar light. Compared with the prevailing metal-based semiconductors, which usually suffer from low quantum efficiency, instability, and limited tunability of the bandgap, metal-free GDY-based materials appear to be superior in terms of the adjustable bandgap and stability of carbon-rich networks.
Feng's group synthesized H-doped GDY (H-GDY) on Cu foil via Glaser coupling of 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene (TEB) (Fig. 14a).184 The as-prepared H-GDY with an optical bandgap of 2.51 eV exhibited PEC activity for H2 evolution. The photocurrent reached ∼10 μA cm−2 at a potential of 0.3 V vs. RHE. When further introducing thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DET) units into H-GDY, the photocurrent was improved to ∼21 μA cm−2, which was mainly ascribed to the enhanced light absorption and electron–hole separation efficiency. These results indicate that it is feasible to improve the PEC activity of GDY via chemical modification.

Wu et al. synthesized two GDY analogues: PTEPB and PTEB, through Glaser coupling of the monomers 1,3,5-tris(4-ethynylphenyl)benzene and 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene, respectively.185 The as-prepared PTEPB and PTEB exhibited high activity for splitting water into H2 and O2 stoichiometrically. The apparent quantum efficiencies of PTEPB and PTEB reached up to 10.3 and 7.6%, respectively, under irradiation at 420 nm. DFT calculations indicated that PTEPB and PTEB catalyzed the OER through a four-electron process and drove the HER via two one-electron transfer processes, corresponding to the formation of *H intermediates at the active sites (Fig. 14b and c). These GDY based photocatalysts remained highly stable after long-time irradiation, indicating that the GDY based frameworks could minimize the charge on the surfaces, thus preventing photochemical degradation.
4.2 Electrocatalytic energy conversion
Apart from the cost disadvantage, metal-based electrocatalysts usually suffer from other multiple drawbacks, including low selectivity, poor durability, impurity poisoning, fuel crossover effects, and detrimental effects on the environment. Thus, plenty of efforts have been made to develop carbon based metal-free electrocatalysts as alternatives to replace metal-based catalysts.12–14 On the basis of the above discussion, the activity of GDY can be improved remarkably by doping heteroatoms or changing the skeleton of the monomers, which offer great potential to fabricate highly active metal-free electrocatalysts and understand their catalytic mechanisms. Next, we will introduce the recent progress of GDY based metal-free electrocatalysts for energy conversion, classified from the perspective of synthetic methods: the “up to bottom” and “bottom to up” methods.

4.2.1 “Up to bottom” method. 
Heteroatom doped GDY can be obtained by heating GDY in an atmosphere containing heteroatom sources, which is called an “up-to-bottom” method. The doping reaction usually proceeds at high temperature (>500 °C). In fact, “up-to-bottom” methods have demonstrated great potential to improve the electrochemical performance of carbon materials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes.186–188 Unlike sp2-hybridized graphene and carbon nanotubes, the coexistence of sp- and sp2 hybridization in GDY may result in different doped sites, such as the benzene ring and the acetylene bond. By using this method, N-doped GDY,82,83 P-doped GDY84 and S-doped GDY85,86 have been prepared. Next, we will discuss the progress of heteroatom doped GDY via the “up-to-bottom” route for electrocatalytic energy conversion.
4.2.1.1 Oxygen reduction reaction. 
Zhang et al. thermally treated GDY with high-purity ammonia at temperatures from 400 to 600 °C to synthesize N-doped GDY.83 The resultant N dopants consisted of two different configurations: one was imino N (substitution of the sp-hybridized carbon atoms) and the other was pyridinic N (substitution of the sp2-hybridized carbon atoms) (Fig. 15a). Compared to pure GDY, the N-doped GDY displayed much higher catalytic activity and the sample treated at 550 °C showed the best performance (Fig. 15b). Although the activity of N-doped GDY is still lower than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts, this work demonstrates that it is possible to fabricate heteroatom-doped GDYs as alternatives to the state-of-the-art metal-based catalysts. Subsequently, Huang et al. prepared N-doped GDY by using pyridine and NH3 as the N donor.82 In brief, GDY was firstly immersed in pyridine for 3 days to adsorb pyridine fully, and then the pyridine-saturated GDY was treated thermally at different temperatures to obtain N-doped GDY. To increase the N-content, the as-prepared GDY-900 °C sample was further treated at 800 °C under an NH3 atmosphere (denoted as N′N-GDY), which introduced novel N configurations of imine N-2, imine N-2,2, and pyridinic N. Impressively, N′N-GDY exhibited comparable catalytic performance with a commercial Pt/C catalyst (20%) (Fig. 15c), and better methanol tolerance than that of Pt/C.

Due to the co-existence of sp and sp2-hybridized carbons in GDY, it is different to control the doping sites in the benzene ring or the acetylene bond. Recently, Zhao et al. introduced a new form of nitrogen doping moieties sp-hybridized nitrogen (sp-N) atoms into few-layer GDY (FLGDY) by a pericyclic reaction to replace the acetylene groups (Fig. 15d).87 After optimizing the doping site and contents of sp-N, the optimal sp-N-doped FLGDY showed outstanding catalytic activity in alkaline solution with a half-wave potential of 0.87 V and kinetic current density of 38.0 mA cm−2 at 0.75 V, comparable to that of Pt/C (Fig. 15e). Notably, it possessed better stability and tolerance to the cross-over effect than Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic environments (Fig. 15f). The current density increased monotonically with the concentration of sp-N atoms (Fig. 15g), indicating that the specific sp-N dopants are the most important active N-doping form for the ORR. This strategy to incorporate sp-N atoms into carbon nanomaterials in a controllable way, and understanding of the doping mechanism, may open new opportunities for site-specific doping of other catalysts.
Except for single-element doping into GDY, Li's group prepared dual-heteroatom co-doped GDY and systematically studied the synergistic effect of the doping elements.189 Three co-doped samples (denoted as N,F-GDY, N,S-GDY and N,B-GDY) were synthesized by heating GDY with specific precursors (NH3 for N, NH4F for F, thiourea for S, and B2O3 for B) and the corresponding mono-element (N, F, S, and B) doped GDY was also prepared for comparision. Specifically, N,F-GDY exhibited a much larger cathodic peak and limiting current density than that of mono- or other dual-doped GDY (Fig. 15h) in 0.1 M KOH, even comparable to commercial Pt/C. More importantly, N,F-GDY showed much better stability and tolerance to methanol and CO poisoning effects than commercial Pt/C. DFT calculations indicated that when F and N atoms were doped into GDY simultaneously the carbon atoms neighboring the doped N and F atoms were induced to have a positive charge density, which would increase the catalytically active sites remarkably.
4.2.1.2 Oxygen evolution reaction. 
Zhao et al. successfully prepared N and S heteroelement co-doped FLGDY catalysts via an improved pyrolysis method by providing continuous doping sources (Fig. 16a).190 Owing to the site-controlled doping of sp-N atoms in GDY, the stereo-positions of N and S atoms are well controlled. The OER activity can be modulated by the doping form, and sp-N plays a dominant role among all the N configurations. The heteroatom co-doped GDY (NSFLGDY-900) exhibited excellent OER performance compared to the FLGDY without doping, even better than that of RuO2 catalysts (Fig. 16b), presenting a lower overpotential and a higher current density. This study opens an avenue for understanding the synergistic effects in hetero-element doped metal-free catalysts.

4.2.1.3 CO2 reduction reaction. 
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction into useful fuels and chemicals offers an intriguing picture to address energy security and environmental pollution.192–195 Although most electrocatalysts rely on metal-based catalysts, the emerging doped carbon-based materials hold great promise as metal-free alternatives. In particular, different N-doped carbon materials, such as carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes, and graphene foam, have been demonstrated as highly efficient and stable catalysts for the CO2RR.196–203 Due to the co-existence of sp and sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in GDY, the chemical activity is highly dependent on the doping sites of heteroatoms in GDY. Zhao's group studied systematically a series of doped GDYs with boron (B) and nitrogen (N) atoms for the CO2RR by DFT calculations.191 They found that the GDYs doped with sp-hybridized B and N at their acetylenic sites exhibited high performance for the conversion of CO2 to CH4 and (especially) C2H4 with a low limiting potential of −0.60 V (Fig. 16c). Such activity was due to the high electrical conductivity, preferable catalytic sites (sp-hybridized dopant), and low free energy for CO2 activation (Fig. 16d). This work indicates that tailoring the dopant sites of B and N atoms in GDY is a promising way to improve the activity and selectivity towards the production of C1 and C2 species.


4.2.2 “Bottom to up” method. 
Although heteroatom-doped GDYs have been successfully synthesized and exhibited improved activity, controlling the N-configuration in GDY accurately remains a challenge. As a result, the precise mechanisms of N-doped catalysts are usually controversial. To address these issues, a controllable strategy to introduce heteroatoms into GDY has been developed, which is called the “bottom-to-up” method. In this method, new monomers are designed for the coupling reactions, in which some acetylenic bonds are replaced by other heteroatoms or functional groups. In addition, some GDY analogues can also be synthesized by the “bottom to up” method and exhibited remarkable activities. In this part, we will summarize the progress of heteroatom doped GDY and GDY analogues synthesized by the “bottom to up” method for energy conversion.
4.2.2.1 Oxygen reduction reaction. 
Li et al. constructed well-defined N-doped GDY nanostructures by using the “bottom to up” method. This method could control the N-configurations (pyridinic N and triazine-like N clusters) and N-content in GDY precisely by employing different precursors (Fig. 17a).34 Especially, the sample N2-GDY was synthesized by using precursor mixtures of N1-GDY and N3-GDY with an equal stoichiometric ratio. The experimental results demonstrated that the pyridinic N facilitated the onset potential to shift positively (from 0.82 to 0.87 V vs. RHE) but the triazine-like N clusters retarded the ORR with an onset potential of 0.8 V (Fig. 17b), probably due to the decreased conductivity. In contrast to the four-electron ORR pathway of bare GDY, the pyridinic N mainly functioned through a two-electron-transfer ORR process and the triazine-like N clusters led to a higher electron transfer number than that of pyridinic N, which disclosed that the introduced N atoms impaired the electron transfer number (Fig. 17c). The accurate control of the N-configuration in GDY not only offers an opportunity to understand the N-element role in catalyzing the ORR but also gives some inspiration to answer the controversial mechanisms in the traditional N-doped sp2 carbons.

Except for N-doped GDY, Li's group reported H-doped GDY (H-GDY) through Glaser coupling of 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene (TEB). Because the hydrogen atoms in H-GDY provided abundant preferential substitutional slots for producing pyridinic N, the subsequently precise synthesis of pyridinic N selectively doped H-GDY was achieved (Fig. 17d).91 When H-GDY was calcined in an NH3 atmosphere over 800 °C, pyridinic N was selectively doped into H-GDY. These pyridinic N doped H-GDY catalysts exhibited better activity for the ORR than that of commercial Pt/C in an alkaline environment. Especially, H-GDY calcined at 900 °C exhibited the best performance, comparable to the reported benchmark metal-free catalysts in alkaline media. DFT calculations indicated that pyridinic N in H-GDY was more effective for the ORR than that in graphene.
4.2.2.2 Hydrogen evolution reaction. 
Sakamoto et al. synthesized pyrazine-incorporated graphdiyne (denoted as PR-GDY) through a liquid/liquid interfacial method (Fig. 17e).204 A series of microscopic analyses revealed that PR-GDY possessed butadiyne linkers and XPS disclosed the selective doping of N atoms (only pyridinic N), which is hard to realize by the “up to bottom” method. Compared to pristine GDY, the PR-GDY films showed significantly improved activity for the HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 with an overpotential of ∼475 mV to reach a 10 mA cm−2 current density (Fig. 17f).
4.2.2.3 Oxygen evolution reaction. 
Cui et al. reported the first use of benzene as a precursor to synthesize γ-graphyne (γ-GY), in which the diacetylenic linkages in GDY are replaced by ethynyl linkages (Fig. 18a).70 Theoretical and experimental results indicated that γ-GY was an ideal candidate for the OER with a Tafel slope of ∼57 mV dec−1. Afterwards, γ-GY was synthesized on Ni foam directly to provide more surface area and improve the stability for the OER. To reach a 100 mA cm−2 current density, the γ-GY/Ni foam only required an overpotential of ∼290 mV and remained stable during 72 h electrolysis. The excellent OER activity of γ-GY makes it a promising electrocatalyst for energy conversion.

As reported, doping with foreign atoms has a large effect on the local electronic/chemical environment of GY, which probably contributes to enhanced OER activity. Liu et al. designed a set of doped GY models,205 and compared the OER performance of these electrocatalysts by DFT calculations. Their findings indicated that boron functionalized GY exhibited better activity than that of N-doped and pristine GY and B1-GY possessed the lowest overpotential (Fig. 18b and c), which is regarded as the optimal electrocatalyst for the OER. It is anticipated that boron-doped GY at edge sites will maximize the catalytic performance for water splitting.
4.2.2.4 Overall water splitting. 
Li's group prepared three-dimensional porous F-doped GDY networks on carbon cloth (p-FGDY/CC) by using a facile in situ growth procedure from 1,3,5-triethynyl-2,4,6-trifluorobenzene monomers (Fig. 19a).89 The metal-free p-FGDY/CC electrode exhibited highly active and stable HER and OER under a wide pH range (0–14). When the p-FGDY/CC electrodes were used as both the anode and cathode (p-FGDY/CC‖p-FGDY/CC) for OWS, it showed low cell voltages of 1.75 V and 1.80 V to achieve 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 19b) and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. The p-FGDY/CC‖p-FGDY/CC electrolyzer maintained long-term stability in both 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4. After 7 h electrolysis, only less than 5.0% degradation was observed at an applied voltage of 1.76 V in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 19c). Such excellent catalytic performance might be due to the high electron-transfer ability, high conductivity, edge/defect-rich structure and the direct contact between the FGDY and CC substrate. DFT indicated that the strong C–F bonding induced charge-polarization (Fig. 19d), leading to an enhancement of the electron-rich character at the C2 site and consequently elevating the electron-transfer ability. This endowed even higher selectivity for various O/H intermediate species adsorption/desorption, which was the essential key promotion of overall water splitting.

5. Conclusion and perspective
In conclusion, the review summarized the up-to-date progress of GDY based catalysts for crucial gas involved catalytic reactions including the HER, the OER, OWS, the ORR, the CO2RR and the NRR, which are considered as the key components of renewable energy conversion technologies. As a novel carbon allotrope, GDY possesses simultaneously sp- and sp2-hybridized carbons. The special structural features facilitate the affinity between GDY and other catalysts, especially for metal-based catalysts, which endows GDY with great potential in fabricating multicomponent catalysts. On the other hand, the abundant doping sites and strong chemical tailorability of the alkynyl-containing monomers enable GDY to serve as metal-free single component catalysts with high performance. Significant advances have been made from experimental and theoretical perspectives, demonstrating GDY as a brilliant star for catalyzing gas involved reactions for energy conversion. However, the research of this field is still at the primary stage, and more efforts should be made to further explore the behaviors of GDY-based catalysts for energy conversion.
First, preparation methods of GDY and GDY analogues with high throughput, high quality, and low cost still need to be developed, which will lay a solid foundation for fundamental research and practical applications. In particular, some new GDY analogues in the GY family with different percentages of acetylenic linkages and skeletons need to be synthesized and studied to optimize the chemical and electronic structures for better catalytic activity towards gas involved reactions. In addition, compared to the HER, OER and ORR, there are only a few examples of GDY-based catalysts for the CO2RR and NRR and thus more attention should be paid to developing GDY based catalysts towards the CO2RR and NRR.
Second, compared to the larger experimental undertaking of GDY-based catalysts for electrocatalytic energy conversion, only limited efforts were made on GDY-based photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts. More attention should be paid to improving the photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic performance of GDY-based catalysts, which can lay emphasis on the following aspects in the future: (i) fabricating GDY-based multistage structures to enhance the light adsorption; (ii) constructing more heterojunctions to facilitate the separation of photo-induced holes and electrons; and (iii) assembling co-catalysts on GDY to accelerate the kinetics.
Third, although plenty of heteroatom doped GDYs have been used as catalysts in the ORR, little effort is devoted towards the HER, OER, CO2RR and NRR, especially for photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis. The introduction of heteroatoms will change a series of physical and chemical properties of GDY, such as the molecular structure, bandgap, active sites, charge mobility, etc. Thus heteroatom doped GDYs should be studied systematically for the HER, OER, CO2RR and NRR to endow them with desired active sites, bandgap and charge mobility, which plays an important role in a variety of photocatalytic and photo-electro-catalytic areas.
Fourth, more attention should be paid to GDY-based metal-free catalysts, especially focusing on the catalytic kinetics and thermodynamics, and long-term stability. In addition, research on understanding the chemical and physical behaviors of the sp-hybridized carbon atoms is also important because of the unique sp-hybridized carbon atoms in GDY. The response of sp-hybridized carbon atoms to external stimuli is essential to the catalytic activity and stability of GDY based catalysts. Such studies can gain experience from acetylene chemistry in organic synthesis.
Fifth, in-depth understanding of the molecular structures and catalytically active sites, and catalytic mechanisms of GDY and GDY-based catalysts is needed, which may be studied by cutting-edge characterization technology along with theoretical calculations, such as operando X-ray adsorption spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The development of computational technologies is also favorable to realize high-performance catalysts. In spite of these challenges, we believe firmly that substantial breakthroughs of GDY-based catalysts for energy conversion will be achieved in the future through scientists’ efforts from different disciplines.

Broader context
Gas involved reactions are essential components of energy conversion technology. Due to the multistep electron and mass transfer, the sluggish kinetics of the reactions leave plenty of room to develop cost-effective and high-performance catalysts to boost the energy conversion efficiency. As a unique 2D carbon nanomaterial with planar structure, uniformly distributed nanopores and large conjugated structure, GDY has shown fascinating properties such as an adjustable natural bandgap, ultrahigh charge carrier mobility, and outstanding conductivity. Herein, the current research progress of GDY-based catalysts for key gas involved reactions in energy conversion is summarized, including photocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis and electrocatalysis. The advantages of GDY are highlighted and compared with other carbon-based materials. Finally, future perspectives and challeges of GDY-based catalysts for energy conversion are also presented.
