    , Accepted 27th May 2016First published on 27th May 2016AbstractTwo novel zinc-metallated porphyrins (ZnP3C and ZnP6C), bearing three and six long alkoxy chains at the periphery of each porphyrin and a terminal carboxylic acid group, have been synthesized and fully characterized. Photophysical and electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the two sensitizers possess suitable frontier orbital energy levels for their use as sensitizers in DSSCs. The solar cells sensitized by ZnP3C and ZnP6C were fabricated resulting in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 5.03 and 6.09%, respectively. As shown by photovoltaic measurements (J–V curves) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the two solar cells, the higher PCE value of the latter is attributed to its enhanced photovoltaic parameters, and particularly its enhanced short circuit current (Jsc). This is related to the stronger absorption profile of the sensitizing dye ZnP6C and the higher dye loading of the corresponding solar cell. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed that the DSSC based on ZnP6C exhibits a longer electron lifetime (τe) and more effective charge recombination resistance between the injected electrons and the electrolyte.
Introduction
The conversion of sunlight to electricity using solar cells is one of the most promising alternatives to energy production by fossil fuels. Consequently, there has been enormous effort in a wide variety of solar cell technologies.1 Nowadays, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are considered to be a rapidly developing technology for solar energy conversion, which enlarges the opportunity for the development of renewable, cheap and environmentally friendly energy production.2–4 A typical DSSC consists of a sensitizing dye being chemically anchored to a nanocrystalline semiconductor, such as TiO2. The mesoporous structure of the semiconducting oxide provides a high surface area, allowing the adsorbed dye to form a layer and enhance its ability to capture the majority of the incident solar light. The mesoporous photoanode is immersed in an electrolyte containing a redox mediator so as to facilitate the charge transport to the counter electrode. Efficient charge separation is achieved through photo-induced electron injection from the excited state of the sensitizing dye into the conduction band of the metal oxide semiconductor. In continuation, the liquid-based electrolyte reduces the resulting dye cations, while at the same time it also directs the holes to the platinum-coated cathode. Therefore the dye sensitizers play an important role in light harvesting and electron injection which greatly influences the overall power conversion efficiency of the corresponding DSSC.5,6
In recent years, many attempts have been devoted to the development of a variety of new efficient sensitizers for practical usage. Compounds based on ruthenium complexes,7–10 metal-free organic dyes,11,12 and porphyrins13–16 were developed and used as efficient sensitizers for DSSCs. DSSCs employing ruthenium(II)-based dyes have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >11% so far. However, the rare resources of ruthenium chromophores and the environmental problems concerning their usage hamper their application in low cost DSSCs. Therefore, metal-free organic dyes have been extensively explored due to their ease of molecular modification and large molar extinction coefficient and have achieved overall a PCE exceeding 12%. Furthermore, due to the numerous features and applications of porphyrins,17–19 many researchers have been inspired to investigate synthetically prepared porphyrin dyes as sensitizers for dye-sensitized light harvesting applications20–22 and they remain one of the most frequently studied dyes.23–26 Accordingly, such derivatives have been widely investigated as alternative sensitizers in DSSCs due to their advantages, namely the ease of synthesis and high stability.27–31 Moreover, their electronic properties can be tuned through functionalization or substitution at their β and meso positions.32–36
The most efficient porphyrin sensitizers consist of electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) groups, connected via π-conjugated spacers,37–39 with the highest achieved power conversion efficiency in DSSCs (13%).28 Most of these D–π–A structured porphyrin sensitizers contain dialkylamine or diarylamine units as donor groups and ethynyl benzoic acid moieties as acceptors, which are covalently linked to the macrocyclic core.40 Despite their remarkable performance, there are factors that limit their ease of application in DSSCs. More specifically, several steps are required for the synthesis of such dyes, which exhibit very low yields and are high cost. Moreover, multi-porphyrin arrays consisting of covalently linked porphyrin macrocycles or other chromophores, such as BODIPY, linked either through suitable π-conjugated groups or directly,41–44 as well as some D–π–A-type supramolecular systems,45–48 have been investigated as sensitizers. Another key factor in porphyrin-based DSSCs is the long alkoxy chains, that are employed to the porphyrin's peripheral units, in order to suppress the formation of aggregates.9 Li et al. designed and synthesized porphyrin dyes with long alkoxy chains and demonstrated that their incorporation at the meso positions is an effective method to prevent dye aggregation and retard the charge recombination, and finally achieved an overall PCE of 7.77%.49 Furthermore, Imahori and coworkers have thoroughly examined the effect of the steric bulkiness around the macrocycle on the performance of a series of zinc porphyrin sensitizers, which bear one anchoring carboxylic acid group, and achieved PCE values that vary from 0.55–4.6%.50
Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis and characterization of two novel porphyrin sensitizers (ZnP3C and ZnP6C), as shown in Scheme 1, which have been synthesized following a three-step procedure with rather good yields. Both ZnP3C and ZnP6C are metallated with zinc and they contain a carboxylic acid as an anchoring group, on one of their meso-phenyls. The remaining peripheral phenyl groups of ZnP3C and ZnP6C are functionalized either with three or with six dodecyloxy chains, respectively. The alkoxy chains were introduced to prevent the dye aggregation and determine whether their increasing number enhances the efficiency of the device. The photovoltaic performance of both ZnP3C- and ZnP6C-sensitized solar cells was monitored and PCE values equal to 5.03 and 6.09%, respectively were achieved. The influence of the alkoxy chains on the performance of the dyes was investigated by measuring their current–voltage (J–V) characteristics, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes, which were followed for the preparation of porphyrins ZnP3C and ZnP6C, are shown in Scheme 2. Both porphyrin dyes, ZnP3C and ZnP6C, are functionalized at one of their meso positions with a benzoic acid moiety and at the remaining three meso positions with substituted phenyl groups bearing three and six dodecyloxy chains, respectively. The benzoic acid moiety can function as an anchoring group onto TiO2, while the long alkoxy chains at the periphery of the macrocycle can prevent the formation of aggregates. Each porphyrin was synthesized following a four-step synthetic procedure, starting in each case from a different precursor, the 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde for ZnP3C and the 3,4-bis(dodecyloxy)benzaldehyde for ZnP6C.
 Scheme 2  Synthetic routes that were followed for the syntheses of dyes ZnP3C and ZnP6C. 
More specifically, the first step, in both routes, is the alkylation of the two precursors, in order to obtain the required aldehydes 1 and 2, according to previously published procedures.51,52 The next step involves the condensation reaction between methyl-4-formylbenzoate, pyrrole and compounds 1 or 2 (according to each sensitizer) via the well-known Adler–Longo methodology,53 which leads to the formation of porphyrins 3 and 4. These two compounds then underwent a reaction with an excess of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O that yielded porphyrins 5 and 6. The formation of metallated compounds 5 and 6 was confirmed by 1H NMR spectrometry where the most noticeable feature is the disappearance of the characteristic signals at −2.75 and −2.77 ppm respectively, which are assigned to the two inner H atoms of the porphyrin ring. Finally, basic hydrolysis of the methyl ester group of both 5 and 6, followed by aqueous workup, resulted in the formation of the desirable sensitizers ZnP3C and ZnP6C. According to the 1H NMR spectra of ZnP3C and ZnP6C, the absence of any signal due to the methyl ester H atoms is to be noted. All synthesized compounds were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF spectrometry (ESI†).
Photophysical properties

Fig. 1a and b show the absorption spectra of ZnP3C and ZnP6C, respectively, both in THF solution and adsorbed onto TiO2 films. The porphyrin dye ZnP3C in solution shows a strong absorption peak at 422 nm and two weak absorption peaks located at 552 nm and 590 nm, which correspond to the Soret and Q bands of the sensitizer.54 Accordingly, in the case of ZnP6C, the Soret band is located at 428 nm and the Q bands at 556 nm and 594 nm. All peaks detected in the absorption spectrum of ZnP6C are broadened and red-shifted, compared to the spectrum of ZnP3C, by 6 nm which can be attributed to the stronger electron-donating ability due to the presence of six alkoxy chains. This indicates that the three additional dodecyloxy chains of the meso-phenyl groups of the ZnP6C porphyrin are not only favourable for suppressing dye aggregation but they also extend the absorption to slightly longer wavelengths. Upon adsorption to 4 μm-thick films, the peaks in the absorption spectra of both dyes are broadened, which is beneficial for improving light harvesting and enhancing the Jsc. This phenomenon is attributed to the formation of J aggregates.55 Moreover, the broader, red-shifted and higher intensity Q bands suggest a strong electronic coupling between the porphyrin and the TiO2 surface. Using the onset absorption edge, λonset, of the Q band of the absorption spectra corresponding to the sensitizers absorbed onto TiO2, and the expression Egopt = 1240/λonset, the optical band gaps were found to be equal to 1.88 and 1.84 eV for ZnP3C and ZnP6C, respectively. It was also observed that the intensities of the Q bands have been significantly enhanced when both dyes were absorbed onto TiO2, a phenomenon attributed to the sunlight scattering caused by the TiO2 nanoparticles.56 All the optical data that resulted from the three UV-vis spectra, which are described above, are shown in Table 1.

Electrochemical properties
In order for a complex to be considered an effective sensitizer in a DSSC, two processes should be taken into consideration: electron injection and efficient dye regeneration. Those two processes necessitate suitably aligned energy levels of the dye's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Firstly, concerning the first process, the LUMO energy level of the dye should be higher than the TiO2 CB edge, while, concerning the second process, the HOMO energy level should be lower than the corresponding redox potential of the electrolyte redox couple.57,58
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of ZnP3C and ZnP6C were determined by both cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 2) and square-wave voltammetry measurements (ESI†). So, the peak potentials for both those compounds are summarized in Table 2. The HOMO energy levels were found to be 1.00 V and 1.10 V vs. SCE for ZnP3C and ZnP6C, respectively, and they are lower than the oxidation potential for the I3−/I− redox couple. Additionally, their LUMO energy levels were found to be −1.29 and −1.30 V vs. SCE, respectively, which are located higher than the TiO2 CB (−0.5 V). Therefore, electron injection from the excited states of both dyes into the TiO2 CB edge59 and regeneration of the photo-oxidized dyes by transferring electrons from I3− of the electrolyte are favoured. Finally, since the LUMO energy level of ZnP6C was found to be farther from the conduction band of TiO2 compared to the ZnP3C LUMO level, we can assume that ZnP6C can provide more sufficient electron injection, and thus a superior photovoltaic performance should be expected of that dye.

Photovoltaic properties
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under illumination and the corresponding incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the DSSCs sensitized by ZnP3C and ZnP6C are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 3. The DSSC based on ZnP3C showed an overall PCE of 5.03% with Jsc = 10.72 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.68 and FF = 0.69. On the other hand, the ZnP6C-sensitized DSSC showed a PCE equal to 6.09% with Jsc = 11.92 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.72 and FF = 0.71. In order to check the influence of the different number of peripheral alkoxy chains of the porphyrin dyes on the performance of their solar cells, we measured the amount of absorbed dye onto the TiO2 film and the results are summarized in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, the dye loading is 1.20 × 10−7 mol cm−2 and 1.22 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for ZnP3C and ZnP6C, respectively, indicating that it is almost the same in both cells. Therefore, the increased Jsc for the DSSC based on ZnP6C as compared to the solar cell sensitized by ZnP3C does not result from an increased amount of the dye attached onto the TiO2 surface. Therefore the increase in the Jsc might be attributed to the presence of three additional electron-pushing dodecyloxy chains on the periphery of the ZnP6C sensitizer, which enhances the intermolecular charge transfer and is favourable for suppressing the formation of dye aggregates and preventing the penetration of the I3− ions of the electrolyte into the semiconductor film, resulting in a higher Voc (0.72 V). Additionally, the LUMO energy level of ZnP6C is located further away from the conduction band of TiO2, compared to that of ZnP3C, providing a higher driving force for electron injection.

The IPCE spectra of the DSSCs sensitized by ZnP3C and ZnP6C both have similar patterns (Fig. 3b) and each one closely resembles its absorption spectrum whilst being absorbed onto TiO2. However, the IPCE values for the solar cell based on ZnP6C are higher than the ones concerning the DSSC sensitized by ZnP3C. The Jsc values estimated from the integration of the IPCE spectra were found to be equal to 10.65 mA cm−2 and 11.76 mA cm−2 for ZnP3C and ZnP6C, respectively and are consistent with the corresponding values observed in the cells' J–V characteristics, including the experimental error. The IPCE value at each wavelength is given by the product of the three efficiencies and is expressed as shown in the following equation:60IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ) × ϕinj(λ) × ηcc(λ)
Since the dye loading is similar for both DSSCs as confirmed by the absorption spectra of ZnP3C and ZnP6C, the major factors determining the IPCE values of our dyes should be ϕinj and ηcc. Therefore we conclude that the product ϕinj × ηcc is higher in the case of ZnP6C than the one found for the ZnP3C cell. Both DSSCs showed a higher IPCE value at the region where the Soret band appears than the region where the Q bands are located. That behavior can be attributed to a better overlap between the LUMO+2 and LUMO+3 orbitals of the porphyrin dyes and the conduction band edge of TiO2 when both DSSCs were excited at the wavelengths of the Soret band. Also, as it may be ascertained from the inset of Fig. 3b, the IPCE values at the Q band region are greater for the DSSC sensitized by ZnP6C than the ones for the cell based on ZnP3C. This may be due to either the three additional alkoxy chains in the 6C sensitizer, which could increase the interfacial charge transfer, or the enhanced formation of dye aggregates in the case of ZnP3C, that could decrease the efficiency of the electron injection process in the corresponding DSSC, leading to low values of both the Jsc and PCE.
In a DSSC, the Voc is determined by the potential difference between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the HOMO energy level of the redox couple contained in the electrolyte (Eredox) which is described by the following equation:61,62  where ECB is the TiO2 conduction band edge, q is the electronic charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the concentration of electrons in TiO2, and NCB is the effective density of states. Since, in both DSSCs, the same electrolytic pair was used, the difference in Voc is dependent upon the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2. Moreover, the electron concentration (n) in the conduction band of TiO2 is expressed by the balance between electron injection and charge recombination processes, and because of that it influences the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2. The higher Voc value observed in the DSSC sensitized by ZnP6C is attributed to the increased electron concentration as well as the enhanced electron injection efficiency.
In an effort to understand the higher value of Voc for the solar cell sensitized by ZnP6C, and to investigate the kinetics of both charge transfer and charge recombination processes occurring in both solar cells, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the DSSCs was recorded in dark conditions, applying an external DC bias equivalent to the open circuit voltage of the cell, i.e. equal to −0.68 V. The typical Nyquist plots of the EIS of the two DSSCs are shown in Fig. 4a. In general, the Nyquist plots of the EIS comprise three arcs that are associated with the charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (high frequency region), the electron transfer kinetics at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (middle frequency region), and the Nernstian diffusion process of I−/I3− in the electrolyte (low frequency region).63–65 The large semicircle observed in the middle frequency region represents the charge transfer resistance values denoted by the recombination kinetics of the electrons transferred from the semiconductor to the electrolyte (charge recombination resistance Rrec), and is inversely proportional to the rate of recombination. The radius of this circle is larger for ZnP6C as compared to that for ZnP3C, indicating an increase of Rrec. This result suggests that the ZnP6C porphyrin dye, which bears at its periphery six dodecyloxy chains, can block the area where the semiconductor and the electrolyte can come directly into contact, meaning that the ZnP6C-based DSSC restrains electron recombination more efficiently leading to a longer electron lifetime. A large Rrec automatically means a small charge recombination rate. The increased value of Rrec for the solar cell based on ZnP6C implies that the back electron recombination with the I3− form of the electrolyte is suppressed, which has as a consequence an increase of the Voc. The electron lifetime (τe) in the DSSCs was estimated from the Bode phase plots of the EIS, according to the relation:66τe = 1/2πfmax. The peak frequency values (fmax) in the middle frequency region represent the electron transfer processes at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (intermediate frequency region). The electron lifetime of the ZnP6C-based DSSC is higher (26 ms) than that for the cell sensitized by ZnP3C (21 ms), a fact that may lead to a reduced rate of the electron recombination process. Therefore, the higher values of both Rrec and τe for the solar cell based on ZnP6C result in an improved overall PCE value for the cell.

DFT calculations
To shed light onto the electronic properties as well as the molecular structures of ZnP3C and ZnP6C, theoretical calculations were performed. The gas phase optimized coordinates of the final compounds are provided in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†) while their gas phase optimized structures are presented in Fig. 5. As shown in the above mentioned figure, in both porphyrin derivatives, the peripheral phenyl groups form a perpendicular orientation with respect to the porphyrin macrocycle and the central Zn atoms are co-planar with the four pyrrole rings, resulting in planar central scaffolds.
 Fig. 5  Gas phase geometry optimized structure of ZnP3C (upper part) and ZnP6C (lower part). Carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen and zinc atoms correspond to grey, blue, white, red and green spheres, respectively. 
The electron density distribution and the corresponding energies of ZnP3C and ZnP6C are depicted in Fig. 6. As shown in the electron density map, the LUMO and LUMO+1 in both complexes are very close in energy and the electron density is spread mainly over the porphyrin unit with additional contributions on the phenyl groups that bear the carboxylic acid. As expected, in both cases (ZnP3C and ZnP6C) the LUMO+2 orbital is located exclusively on the terminal carboxylate group. In perfect agreement with the latter, the same behavior is detected for the HOMO orbitals of both porphyrin derivatives. Namely, the HOMO and HOMO−1 orbitals are located on the porphyrin macrocycle while the HOMO−2 orbitals are found on the alkoxy chains of the peripheral phenyl units. Interestingly enough, while the electron distribution of ZnP3C and ZnP6C was almost identical, their dipole moment significantly differs. More specifically, the dipole moment of ZnP3C was 7.49 D while for ZnP6C the dipole moment was found to be 9.65 D. The dipole moment determines the intramolecular charge delocalization of a system and it is the key of the intramolecular charge transfer. Larger dipole moments lead to more efficient sensitizers in DSSCs according to many examples in the literature.67 The greater dipole moment of ZnP6C is in agreement with the experimental results of the sensitized solar cells that report a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.09%, in comparison with the considerably lower 5.03% of ZnP3C. Moreover, the dipole moment of ZnP6C is higher than that for ZnP3C, which indicates an increase in the electron injection efficiency in the DSSC based on the former porphyrin dye.

The corresponding HOMO and LUMO energies of ZnP3C and ZnP6C along with the HOMO–LUMO gap and the dipole moment are listed in Table 5. It is noteworthy that the calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps in THF solution were found to be 2.69 eV for ZnP3C and 2.66 eV for ZnP6C. This value is similar to the experimentally observed HOMO–LUMO gap from electrochemistry experiments (Table 5).

Conclusions
In this work, we have synthesized two novel porphyrin dyes (ZnP3C and ZnP6C), which are two zinc-metallated porphyrin derivatives that bear three and six dodecyloxy chains, respectively at their peripheries and they both contain a carboxylic acid group, as promising sensitizers for DSSCs. The substitution of both sensitizers with three and six long alkoxy chains, respectively, aims to prevent the formation of porphyrin aggregates on the TiO2 surface, which is a major reason for the low performance of porphyrin-based DSSCs. The photophysical and electrochemical measurements of ZnP3C and ZnP6C reveal that they possess suitable energy levels for efficient electron injection and regeneration processes when used as sensitizers for DSSCs. The ZnP3C- and ZnP6C-based solar cells were both fabricated and gave PCE values of 5.03 and 6.09% respectively. As demonstrated by the J–V curves, the IPCE, and EIS of the two DSSCs, the higher PCE value of the one sensitized by ZnP6C can be attributed to its enhanced short circuit current (Jsc) under illumination, its longer electron lifetime (τe), and higher charge recombination resistance.

NMR spectra

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE III-500 MHz and Bruker DPX-300 MHz spectrometers using solutions in deuterated solvents and the solvent peak was chosen as the internal standard.
Mass spectra
High resolution mass spectrometry spectra were recorded on a Bruker ultrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF spectrometer, using trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile as the matrix.
Photophysical measurements
A Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrophotometer was used for the UV-vis absorption spectra measurements, and the emission spectra were measured on a JASCO FP-6500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a red sensitive WRE-343 photomultiplier tube (wavelength range 200–850 nm).
Computational details
All the density functional theory calculations68 were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)69,70 level of theory using the GAUSSIAN 03 program suite.71 For geometry optimization the LANL2DZ basis set was used for the Zn atoms and 6-31G(d) for the lighter atoms. The optimized minimum energy structures were subjected to vibrational frequency analysis calculation to ensure the absence of imaginary frequency. Tomasi's polarized continuum model (PCM)72 was used for describing the solvent effect of THF with standard dielectric contestant ε = 7.426. The output geometries were visualized using the Chemcraft software (version 1.6).73
Electrochemistry
An AutoLab PGSTAT20 potentiostat was used for both cyclic and square-wave voltammetry experiments, which were carried out at room temperature. Measurements were carried out in freshly distilled and deoxygenated THF, at a rate of 100 mV s−1, with a solute concentration of ∼1.0 mM in the presence of tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte. A three-electrode cell setup was used with a platinum working electrode, a saturated calomel (SCE) reference electrode, and a platinum wire counter electrode.
DSSC fabrication and characterization
For the fabrication of DSSCs, at first the transparent fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glasses were washed with detergent solution, deionized water, ethanol and acetone successively under ultrasonication for 20 min and then they were dried. Then deposited on the FTO substrates was a TiO2 compact layer (about 30 nm) via spray pyrolysis at 450 °C from a precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in anhydrous ethanol and the substrates were kept at 450 °C for 30 min and after that time they were left to cool down. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited by the doctor blade technique using Dyesol 30 NR-D diluted in ethanol to achieve a thick layer. After deposition of the TiO2 film, the substrates were immediately dried at 100 °C for 10 min and then sintered again at 450 °C for 30 min and cooled down to room temperature. After cooling to room temperature, they were immersed into a 0.02 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 20 minutes, washed with distilled water and ethanol, and annealed again at 500 °C for 20 min. The thickness of the TiO2 electrodes was measured using a thin film thickness measurement system (Nano calc XR Ocean Optics, Germany) and it were found to be in the range of 10–12 μm. The prepared films were immersed into a 0.3 mM solution of each respective porphyrin dye, containing 2 mM of chenodeoxycholic acid in a mixture of DMSO and THF (volume ratio 1:4) for 12 hours. The counter electrode was prepared by spin coating of a H2PtCl4 solution (0.002 g in 1 mL i-PrOH) onto a pre-cleaned FTO coated glass substrate and then heating at 450 °C for 15 min in air. The sensitized working electrode was assembled with the Pt-coated FTO electrode into a sandwich-type cell and sealed with the hot-melt polymer surlyn as spacer between the electrodes. To complete the DSSC fabrication, the electrolyte solution containing LiI (0.05 M), I2 (0.03 M), 1 methyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (0.6 M) and tert-butylpyridine (0.5 M in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile, 85:15 volume ratio) was introduced into the space between the two electrodes through a drilled hole in the platinum-coated FTO by vacuum back-filling.
