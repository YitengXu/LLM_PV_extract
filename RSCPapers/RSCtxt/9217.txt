    , Accepted 21st November 2022First published on 15th February 2023AbstractSnO2, the most promising alternative to TiO2 as the electron transport layer (ETL), has attracted great attention for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its high bulk electron mobility, good band energy at the ETL/perovskite interface, and high chemical stability. To enable more efficient carrier transfer and extraction, elemental doping with different metal cations has been studied in SnO2 ETLs. However, the systematic investigation of the doping mechanism lag far behind their efficiency promotion. In this paper, elements of the same main group (Li, Na, K) and period (K, Ca, Ga) have been selected for doping in SnO2. The results showed that among the properties of the dopants, the electronegativity has the greatest influence. The smaller the electronegativity of the doping species, the more conducive it is to carrier transmission and separation. The corresponding mechanism was proposed and discussed. At last, an efficiency of 20.92% of PSCs based on SnO2–K was achieved. In addition, the doped SnO2 is more beneficial for the growth of perovskite crystals, thus reducing grain boundaries and enhancing the stability of the device.
Introduction
The rapid development of organic/inorganic halide perovskite materials has attracted tremendous research attention, which is attributed not only to the favorable intrinsic properties of perovskite materials including the high absorption coefficient, low trap density, and long charge-carrier diffusion length,1–3 but also to the optimization of perovskite composition, crystallization control, precise processes of film controlling and interfacial engineering.4–8 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased from 3.8%9 to the highest of 25.7%.10 Electron transport layers (ETLs), extracting electrons from the perovskite absorption layer, are vital to manufacture efficient PSCs. They are a crucial strategy in enhancing charge separation and transport, reducing interfacial recombination, improving the efficiency of photo-generated electron extraction, and effectively blocking holes from moving toward the cathode.11,12
The most widely studied ETL material for PSCs is titanium dioxide (TiO2). However, the traditional TiO2 ETLs exhibit low electron mobility and high energy consumption.13,14 SnO2 is an outstanding alternative option to TiO2, which exhibits a suitable energy level, high electron mobility, and high light stability.14–16 State-of-the-art, the certified PCE of PSCs based on SnO2 is 25.5%.17 However, the spontaneous aggregation of SnO2 results in pinholes or island morphology for SnO2-based ETLs. What's more, the defects, existing at the interfaces between SnO2 and perovskite, cause severe charge recombination and exacerbate the instability.18,19
To solve the above issues in SnO2-based ETLs, modified strategies have been developed, including surface passivation, SnO2-based bilayer ETLs, and element doping. For surface passivation, TiCl4 and UV-ozone treatments are commonly used. TiCl4 treatment could eliminate the donor-type defects and oxygen vacancies, resulting in reduced recombination and improving the charge transfer.20 UV-ozone treatment could be used to remove surface contaminants or residuals, reduce oxygen vacancies, and improve surface wettability.21 For element doping, Kim et al. demonstrate that KCl treatment could improve the band alignment, passivate the defects, and eliminate the J–V hysteresis, resulting in enhanced PCE with improved open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).22 When SnO2 is combined with fullerene (C60) and its derivatives, such as C60-SAM and PCBM, as bilayer ETLs, inefficient charge extraction and interfacial recombination could be further eliminated.23,24 The electrons collected from C60 would partially fill the surface trap states in SnO2 nanosheets and passivate both the C60/perovskite and SnO2/C60 interfaces.25 The introduction of the PC60BM layer between TiO2 and perovskite layers could enhance the charge extraction.26 Doping SnO2 ETLs with metal cations could improve the properties of both the ETL and the ETL/perovskite interface, which has been proved as an efficient way to passivate defects, enhance conductivity, and decrease the interfacial recombination of carriers. By now, several dopants, such as Li,27 K,28 Ga,29 Nb,30 Y,31 Zr,32 and Ta,33,34 have been utilized. Although metal-doped SnO2 has been studied, the systematic investigation and the mechanism of metal doping have not been studied.
In this work, elements of the same main group (Li, Na, K) and the same period (K, Ca, Ga) have been selected for doping in SnO2, where the systematic investigation has been carried out. After carefully comparing doping with different metals, the mechanism of element doping was proposed.
Results and discussion
To investigate the effect of main group dopants in SnO2 ETLs, Li, Na, and K from the same main group (IA) have been selected. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum indicated that Li, Na, and K elements had been successfully doped in SnO2, as shown in Fig. 1a and Fig. S1 (ESI†). Due to the order of electronegativity Li > Na > K, the binding energy shift of Sn was more obvious in SnO2–Li than in SnO2–Na and SnO2–K, as shown in Fig. 1b. For the O 1s atomic orbital, as shown in Fig. 1c, the dopant of Li, Na, and K formed the bonding of Li–O–Sn, Na–O–Sn, and K–O–Sn.32 The strong electron-withdrawing property of Li made the O 1s atomic orbital shift much larger, where the order of the O 1s atomic orbital shift was SnO2–Li > SnO2–Na > SnO2–K.

From the comparison with the pristine SnO2 film, X-ray diffraction (XRD) results demonstrated that no additional peaks appeared after doping, as shown in Fig. 2a. It indicated that Li, Na, and K dopants were not in the lattice of SnO2. Combined with XPS results in Fig. 1, we speculated that the dopants were in the grain boundary and interfaces of the SnO2 film. To illustrate the effect of doping, the full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the diffraction angle (2θ = 25.6° and 51.2°) in the XRD parameter showed that the SnO2 film doped with K had the largest grain size, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) and I–V measurements have been carried out to make sure the SnO2 film doped with K had the best properties. The calculation of the trap density (Nt) of different films is based on the equation Nt = 2VTFLεrε0/eL2, where εr is the relative dielectric constant, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, VTFL is the trap-fill limit voltage, e is the elementary charge, and L is the thickness of the ETL film.35 The results showed that the order of VTFL was SnO2 (0.477 V) > SnO2–Li (0.180 V) > SnO2–Na (0.145 V) > SnO2–K (0.103 V), as shown in Fig. 2b. After calculation, the order of electron trap densities was SnO2 (2.008 × 1017 cm−3) > SnO2–Li (7.578 × 1016 cm−3) > SnO2–Na (6.104 × 1016 cm−3) > SnO2–K (4.336 × 1016 cm−3). It meant that the SnO2–K film has the lowest electron trap density, which would reduce the trap-mediated carrier recombination. The I–V curve in Fig. 2c demonstrates that higher electrical conductivity was observed in the SnO2–K sample, which originated from the passivation of defects.36

In order to demonstrate the effect of metal dopants, the surface morphology of the perovskite film was tested. The results showed that the lower the density of defect states in ETLs (SnO2–K film), the larger the grain size and the fewer the grain boundary in the perovskite film, as shown in Fig. 3a–d. XRD also showed that SnO2–K has the greatest effect on the crystallization of the perovskite film, where the optimal perovskite film was obtained on SnO2–K ETLs, as shown in Fig. 3e and Table S2 (ESI†). At the same time, dopants also changed the energy level alignment (ELA) of SnO2 ETLs. The results illustrated that the conduction band (CB) of different SnO2 ETLs was promoted after doping, as shown in Fig. 3f and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) results in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The CB of SnO2–K was closer to that of the perovskite, which would lead to the reduction of the loss of Voc in devices.

The photovoltaic performance test of PSCs (FTO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au) showed that the doped ETLs were beneficial in improving the PCE. The PCE order was PSCs based on SnO2–K > PSCs based on SnO2–Na > PSCs based on SnO2–Li > PSCs based on SnO2, as shown in Fig. 4a, Fig. S3–S5 (ESI†), and Table 1. The device based on SnO2–K ETLs has a Voc of 1.10 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 24.88 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.76, and a PCE of 20.92%. The ELA results in Fig. 3f showed that the CB of SnO2–K was much closer to that of the perovskite, which would lead to the reduction of the loss of open-circuit voltage (Voc) in devices. The better the ELA was, the higher Voc could be achieved. The reduced trap state density would lead to lower charge recombination, which played a role in improving the Jsc. The corresponding incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), as shown in Fig. 4b, was in good agreement with the Jsc in the current–voltage (J–V) measurement. The superior photovoltaic performance for the devices with Li, Na, and K doped SnO2 was also confirmed by the stabilized power output measurement, as shown in Fig. 4c. The results indicated that PSCs based on Li, Na, and K doped SnO2 were stable in maintaining the steady-state output.

In order to explain the effect of doped ETLs on the charge transfer dynamics of devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), dark current, and transient photovoltage (TPV) tests were carried out. The results of EIS showed that the PSCs based on SnO2–K ETLs had the smallest charge transfer resistance (Rtr) and the largest charge recombination resistance (Rrec), as shown in Fig. 4d and Table S3 (ESI†). That meant the trap state density of SnO2 ETLs decreased and the electrical conductivity increased due to the doping, which was conducive to carrier transfer. The dark current, as shown in Fig. 4e, also indicated that the trap state density of the whole device was reduced and the non-radiative recombination was suppressed, which was consistent with photoluminescence (PL) results, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The TPV test (Fig. 4f) showed that the carriers’ lifetime of PSCs based on SnO2–K > the carriers’ lifetime of PSCs based on SnO2–Na > the carriers’ lifetime of PSCs based on SnO2–Li > the carriers’ lifetime of PSCs based on SnO2, which demonstrated that the dopants could improve the carriers’ lifetime.37 The above charge transfer dynamics tests showed that doping could increase the lifetime of charge carriers, enhance charge transfer, and reduce non-radiative recombination. The dopant K was the best one.
To investigate the effect of periodic dopants, K, Ca, and Ga (from the fourth period in the periodic table of elements) were selected to dope SnO2. XPS spectra showed that K, Ca, and Ga elements had been successfully doped in SnO2, as shown in Fig. 5a and Fig. S7 (ESI†). Owing to the order of electronegativity Ga > Ca > K, the interaction of SnO2–K was larger than others. Therefore, the binding energy shift of SnO2–Ga was more obvious than that of SnO2–Ca and SnO2–K, as shown in Fig. 5b. For O 1s atomic orbitals, as shown in Fig. 5c, the dopants K, Ca, and Ga formed the bonds of K–O–Sn, Ca–O–Sn, and Ga–O–Sn. Because of the strong electron-absorbing properties of Ga, the order of O 1s atomic orbital shift was SnO2–Ga > SnO2–Ca > SnO2–K.

The XRD (Fig. 6a) results demonstrated that no additional peaks appeared after doping, which indicated that K, Ca, and Ga dopants were not in the lattice of SnO2. But the FWHM of the diffraction angles (2θ = 25.6° and 51.2°) of the XRD parameter showed that the SnO2 film doped with K had the largest grain size than others, as shown in Table S4 (ESI†). The SCLC and I–V measurements were carried out, where the order of VTFL was SnO2–Ga (0.214 V) > SnO2–Ca (0.202 V) > SnO2–K (0.103 V), as shown in Fig. 6b. It meant that SnO2–K ETLs had the lowest electron trap density. After calculation, the order of electron trap densities was SnO2–Ga (9.01 × 1016 cm−3) > SnO2–Ca (8.504 × 1016 cm−3) > SnO2–K (4.336 × 1016 cm−3). The I–V curves in Fig. 6c demonstrated that SnO2–K ETLs had higher electrical conductivity, which originates from the passivation of defects in SnO2.

To illustrate the effect of the same periodic dopants on SnO2 ETLs, the perovskite film was spin-coated on them. The results showed that the grain size of the perovskite film coated on SnO2–K ETLs was the largest, resulting in fewer grain boundaries, as shown in Fig. 7a–c. XRD also showed that SnO2–K has the greatest effect on the crystallization of the perovskite film, where the FWHM of the perovskite film based on SnO2–K ETLs was smaller than others, as shown in Fig. 7d and Table S5 (ESI†). Meanwhile, the same periodic dopant doped SnO2 ETLs also changed their ELA, where the CB of SnO2–K ETLs was closer to that of the perovskite, giving rise to the reduction of the loss of Voc in devices, as shown in Fig. 7e and UPS results in Fig. S8 (ESI†).

For the same periodic dopants doped SnO2 ETLs, the photovoltaic performance showed that PSCs based on SnO2–K ETLs were better than PSCs based on SnO2–Ca and PSCs based on SnO2–Ga, as shown in Fig. 8a, Fig. S5, S9, S10 (ESI†), and Table 2. The photovoltaic performance of PSCs based on SnO2–Ca and PSCs based on SnO2–Ga was almost the same. The improved PCE of PSCs based on SnO2–K ETLs resulted from the large grain size and the low grain boundaries in the perovskite film and the better ELA. The corresponding IPCE, as shown in Fig. 8b, was in good agreement with the Jsc in J–V measurements. The superior photovoltaic performance was also confirmed by the stabilized power output measurement, as shown in Fig. 8c. The results indicated that PSCs based on K, Ca, and Ga doped SnO2 were stable in maintaining a steady-state output.

The charge transfer dynamics showed that the PSCs based on SnO2–K ETLs had the smallest Rtr and the largest Rrec, as shown in Fig. 8d and Table S6 (ESI†). That meant K doped SnO2 ETLs were conducive to the transfer of charge. The dark current of PSCs based on SnO2–K ETLs, as shown in Fig. 8e, indicated that the trap state density of the whole device was reduced and the non-radiative recombination was suppressed, which was consistent with PL results, as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The TPV test (Fig. 8f) showed that the dopants were beneficial in improving the carriers’ life, where the order of carriers’ life was PSCs based on SnO2–K > PSCs based on SnO2–Ca > PSCs based on SnO2–Ga. The above charge transfer dynamics tests showed that doping could increase the lifetime of charge carriers, promote transmission, enhance charge transfer, and reduce non-radiative recombination. PSCs based on SnO2–K have the best charge transfer dynamics, whereas PSCs based on SnO2–Ca were better than those based on SnO2-Ga.
By comparing the effects of dopants of the same main group and the same period in SnO2 ETLs, with the principle shown in Fig. 9a and b, we find that the doped elements were not in the lattice of SnO2. However, the dopants played a role in the crystallization of SnO2, which resulted in large SnO2 crystals, leading to fewer crystal defects and better electrical conductivity. For the dopants of the same main group, we find that the order of electron trap densities is SnO2 > SnO2–Li > SnO2–Na > SnO2–K, while for the dopants of the same period the order of electron trap densities is SnO2–Ga > SnO2–Ca > SnO2–K. From the ionic radius and electronegativity of these elements, it could be inferred that the main factor affecting the doping of elements is the electronegativity of ions, which will affect the electron cloud formed by SnO2. The larger ionic radius and lower ion electronegativity of K make SnO2–K have better conductivity and lower electron trap densities, which gives rise to better photovoltaic performance. For SnO2 doped with Ca and Ga, one end of Ca and Ga is connected to O–Sn, while the other end is connected to Cl. The electronegativity of Cl is very strong, resulting in the electron clouds of Sn–O–Ca–Cl and Sn–O–Ga–Cl2 biased towards Cl, resulting in very similar doping effects and photovoltaic performance for PSCs with these ETLs.

To verify the reproducibility, the histogram data of the PCEs of 16 solar cells were measured, as shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). The results of the reproducibility measurements indicated that the PSCs of SnO2–Li, Na, K, Ca, and Ga had good reproducibility. Long-term stability was also an important evaluation criterion for the performance of different ETL materials, as shown in Fig. 9c and d. We tested the devices without any encapsulation in a desiccator (25 °C, RH 10%). It could be seen that the PCE of PSCs based on pristine SnO2 ETLs decreased to 72% of its initial value after 1000 h storage, while the SnO2–Li, Na, K, Ca, Ga based device still retained 81.9%, 83.2%, 84.2%, 80.1%, and 79.1% of its initial value. PSCs with SnO2–K had the best stability due to the better crystallization and lower defects of the perovskite film based on doped ETLs.
Conclusions
Dopants of different metals, belonging to the same main group and the same period, have been added in SnO2 ETLs. After the systematic investigation of the same main group and the same period metals doping, results showed that the electronegativity of doped elements has the greatest influence for doping in alkali metals. The lower electronegativity of the alkali metals resulted in the electron cloud close to SnO2, which is more conducive to carrier transfer and separation. For the same period metal doping, the electronegativity of anions also influences the properties of SnO2 ETLs. The more the anions connected to the Sn–O, the worse the SnO2 ETLs would be, giving rise to lower photovoltaic performance for PSCs. Finally, the SnO2–K doping film has low defect density and high conductivity, leading to a PCE of 20.92%. With SnO2–K, the devices could retain 84.2% of their initial PCE after storing for 1000 h without any encapsulation in a desiccator (25 °C, 10% RH), which also showed good reproducibility and reliability.

The optimized concentration of LiCl, NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and GaCl3 is provided in the ESI.† 80 μL of the above solution was spin-coated on the FTO at 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 40 min in air. The substrates were then treated with UV-ozone for 30 min before transferring into the glove box.
The perovskite precursor solution was composed of FAI (1.19 M), PbI2 (1.31 M), MABr (0.21 M), PbBr2 (0.21 M) and CsI (0.07 M), which were dissolved in DMF:DMSO = 4:1 (volume ratio). The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on SnO2 substrates in a two-step procedure at 1000 and 5000 rpm for 10 s and 30 s, respectively. At 15 s before the last spin-coating step, 150 μL of CB was dropped onto the substrate. Finally, it was annealed at 100 °C for 75 min on the hot plate. After cooling to room temperature, Spiro-solution, which consists of 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution in 1 mL of CB, was deposited on perovskite films at 3500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 70 nm Au was thermally evaporated as the electrode under a high vacuum using an Ebeam-Thermal evaporation system.
The cells were irradiated by using the Peccell-L15 solar simulator (Pencell, Japan) under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2. Keithley 2460 (Keithley, America) was used to record J–V characteristics of the cells. XPS was conducted on a Thermo Scientific ESCLAB 250Xi spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). UPS was conducted with He(I) radiation at 21.22 eV. SEM images with top views were obtained by using Nova Nano SEM 450 (FEI, USA). The structural properties of carbon materials were evaluated by XRD analysis (XRD-7000S). A xenon lamp coupled with a monochromator (PEC-S20, Peccell) controlled by a computer was used to measure the IPCE. PL spectra were measured using C5410 (Hamamatsu) with an optically triggered fringe camera with a 517 nm laser. Nyquist plot measurements were conducted with an electrochemical workstation (Zen-nium Zahner, Germany) under light illumination as well as 0.6 V forward bias voltages and 20 mV amplitude of AC perturbation ranging from 100 mHz to 1 MHz.
