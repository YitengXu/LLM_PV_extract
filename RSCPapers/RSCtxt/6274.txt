It delivers a reversible capacity of 72 and 69 mA h g−1 with redox potentials of 3.415/3.234 V (vs. Na+/Na) and 3.579/3.483 V (vs. Li+/Li) in sodium and lithium intercalation systems, respectively. Moreover, it also exhibits superior high rate capabilities and good cycling stability, which delivers 81% (for sodium) and 70% (for lithium) of the capacity at a 5 C rate. Therefore, the hierarchical sandwich-type architecture is favorable to realizing superior electrochemical performance for the sulfate, which presents a significant step forward in the development of low-cost large-scale batteries.
1 Introduction
The development of solar and wind energy demands more efficient energy storage systems. Among the various options available, electrochemical storage represents the most promising strategy because of its flexibility, high energy conversion efficiency and easy maintenance.1 Lithium ion batteries, which have the highest energy density, are the best choice for portable electronic devices and electric vehicles.2,3 However, their applications are limited by disadvantages such as high cost and scarce resources of lithium. Therefore, employing other guest ions as alternatives to lithium ions is favorable to developing intercalation chemistry. Sodium ion batteries with abundant resources and low cost appear as a promising alternative to lithium ion batteries.4,5 Particularly, the superiority of sodium batteries over their lithium counterpart becomes more notable when applied in large-scale storage where sustainability and cost are primary concerns. However, the larger ionic radius of sodium than lithium makes it more difficult to find a suitable host for fast ion de/intercalation. Thus it is urgent to discover novel electrode materials with enhanced ion intercalation capability for superior electrochemical properties.
Among the present electrode materials, polyanionic materials have attracted a large amount of attention. Since the 1980s, various polyanionic materials, such as silicates (A2MSiO4),6–9 borates (AMBO3),10 phosphates (AMPO4),11,12 pyrophosphates (AMP2O7),13–19 and fluorophosphates (AMPO4F),20,21 have been extensively studied. But their low operating potentials restrict their practical applications. Knowing that the redox potential of an intercalation compound is associated with the iono-covalency of metal–anion bonding,22,23 a great deal of effort has been made to search for more electronegative polyanions. On this background, sulfate polyanionic (SO42−) materials come into sight as a new member in the polyanionic family.24–28 Compared with other polyanionic materials, the sulfates possess stronger electronegativity, which is favorable to achieving a higher redox potential. Recently, a series of sulfate-based polyanionic compounds such as Li2M(SO4)2,25,26 LiMSO4OH,27,28 Na2M(SO4)2·nH2O,29,30 Na2M2(SO4)3 (ref. 31) and fluorosulfates of LiMSO4F32,33 have been investigated. The exploration of these sulfate-based compounds dramatically expands the research scope of intercalation chemistry and provides new opportunities for polyanionic materials.
Especially, a very recently reported iron-based hydrated sulfate, kröhnkite-type Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O, has captured our attention. The symmetrically arranged SO4 tetrahedral and FeO6 octahedral units construct a pseudolayered monoclinic structure for Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O, which results in the convoluted sodium channels and reversible ion intercalation.30 As the first member of bihydrated sulfate for sodium ion batteries, the discovery of Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O opens up new routes for sulfate chemistry. However, facing the same problems as other sulfate-based materials, namely high moisture sensitivity and limited conductivity,24,25 its crystal structure stability and electrochemical kinetics are severely restricted. Therefore, further improvements on both thermodynamic stability and fast intercalation chemistry are still big challenges for it.
In the “rocking-chair” system, the transport of electrons and ions is a crucial factor for ion intercalation kinetics. Nanoengineering is an effective strategy to shorten the ion/electron diffusion length and facilitate their transport.34,35 However, lower volume densities and poor connectivity between individual particles always take place with the decreasing particle size. Thus it is highly desirable to discover new strategies to meet ever increasing demands of high power applications. Constructing a three-dimensional conductive scaffold is an effective approach to enhance the electronic conductivity. The 3D scaffold not only acts as a volume buffer but also builds continuous electron pathways.36–38 Therefore, if the sulfate nanoparticles could be assembled into a conductive matrix and form a hierarchical structure, it would be one of the most effective approaches towards high performance electrode materials.
Following this viewpoint, we design and construct 3D graphene-based sandwich-type architecture for sulfates. We choose bihydrate sulfate (Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O) as a model material, but this strategy can also be applied to other sulfates as well. A simple low-temperature synthetic approach is employed to prepare the hierarchical composite. As schemed in Fig. 1(a), the approach starts from dispersion of graphene nanosheets in distilled water. Then sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) and hydrate iron sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O) with a desirable amount of iron wire were added to the suspension. After the mixture turns to a uniform sticky suspension, it was transferred to an oven at 70 °C after the removal of surplus iron wire for a final hierarchical composite. The low-temperature synthesis ensures slow in situ crystallization of hydrate sulfate, which results in the desirable phase and morphology for the target composite.

Fig. 1(b) illustrates the hierarchical sandwich-type nanostructure for the prepared Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O–graphene composite. The hydrated sulfate nanoparticles uniformly anchored on each graphene nanosheet, and all of graphene–sulfate sheets pile up layer by layer to construct 3D sandwich-type architecture. The graphene-based scaffold provides fast electronic pathways and gives protection for sulfates against structural deterioration. Therefore, advantages such as improved conductivity, better electrochemical kinetics and enhanced structural stability are expected.
Inspired by these advantages, the crystal stability and sodium–lithium intercalation chemistry of the prepared sandwich-type Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O–graphene composite were investigated in this study. The structural deterioration of bihydrate sulfate is discussed and a possible shell–core hydration mechanism is disclosed.
2 Experimental
2.1 Synthesis
A simple low-temperature synthetic approach is employed to prepare Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O–graphene hierarchical nanostructures. Graphene was produced by the reduction of graphene oxide prepared by a modified Hummers method, which was purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd. First, the graphene nanosheet was dispersed in 10 ml distilled water under ultrasonication for two hours. Then equal amounts of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) and hydrate iron sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O) with a desirable amount of iron wires were added to the suspension under magnetic stirring. After it turns to a uniform sticky suspension, the mixture was transferred to an oven at 70 °C with the removal of iron wires to obtain a final hierarchical sandwich-type Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O–graphene composite.
2.2 Materials characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8/Germany) using Cu Kα radiation was employed to identify the crystalline phase of the material. The experiment was performed in step mode with a fixed time of 3 s and a step size of 0.02°. The morphology was observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, HITACHI S-4700) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOS-2010 PHILIPS). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250) was employed to measure the chemical state of each element in the surface. Infrared spectra were recorded using a Fourier transform spectrophotometer (FT-IR, Bruker VERTEX 80/Germany). Raman spectra of the composites were collected on a Jobin-Yvon Labor Raman system (Raman, HR-800 HORIBA). The electronic conductivity was measured on the pellet of powder. The powder was pressed into a disk with gold painted on both sides to ensure electrical contact.
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements were carried out using coin type cells. For a sodium system, the Na foil was employed as the counter and reference electrode and 1 mol·L−1 NaClO4 dissolved in propylene carbonate (PC) was used as the electrolyte. For a lithium system, the Li foil was employed as the counter and reference electrode and 1 mol·L−1 LiPF6 dissolved in the mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) was used as the electrolyte. Galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were performed in the potential range of 1.5–4.2 V vs. Na/Na+ and 1.7–4.5 V vs. Li/Li+ at ambient temperature on a Land battery testing system (Wuhan, China). Current–voltage curves were obtained using a Zivelab electrochemical workstation.
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 2(a) shows XRD patterns of the pristine Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O and hierarchical Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O–graphene composites. Both materials can be indexed to the kröhnkite monoclinic structure (space group: P21/c) with the parameters of a = 5.7685(3), b = 12.9835(4), c = 5.4536(1) Å, β = 105.9623(5)° and a = 5.7712(1), b = 12.9804(6), c = 5.4558(6) Å, β = 105.9380(6)° for pristine and hierarchical samples, respectively. Compared with the pristine sample, the hierarchical composite reveals much lower peak densities, which can be attributed to the attachment of sulfate particles to graphene nanosheets. In both materials, the Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O phase coexists as a secondary phase as illustrated in Fig. 2(b). Based on the Rietveld results, about 3.82% and 3.56% of Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O impurity phases were detected in the pristine and hierarchical composites, respectively.

(b) Rietveld results of pristine sample and the crystal structure of Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O is illustrated in the inset. (c) FT-IR of the hierarchical and pristine materials. 
The crystal structure of Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O is illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2(b). The [Fe(SO4)2·(H2O)2]∞ is constructed through each [FeO6] octahedron sharing four corners with four adjacent [SO4] tetrahedra and two other corners contribute to structural H2O molecules. Sodium atoms occupy interstitial positions along the [Fe(SO4)2·(H2O)2]∞ chains, which in turn is linked by both Na–O and hydrogen bonds to construct the pseudolayered structure. Sodium ions can diffuse along the well-defined convoluted channels in the framework. Therefore, the structure of Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O is favorable to realizing reversible sodium de/intercalation.
In the crystal structure of Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O, the sulfate units act as the polydentate ligands, which is revealed by the FT-IR spectrum. As displayed in Fig. 2(c), the split of asymmetric stretching (ν3: 1101 cm−1) and bending (ν4: 608 cm−1) modes at a low wavenumber indicates the degeneration of pristine peaks for the sulfate group. It demonstrates the overall asymmetry of SO4 arrangement and indicates its connecting role in the crystal structure. On the other hand, obvious broad peaks at 3213 and 3410 cm−1 are observed at a high wavenumber, which corresponds to the hydroxyl groups and H2O units. It further confirms the enriching hydroxyl groups in the crystal structure. Compared with the pristine one, the hierarchical composite displays much lower intensities in the low wavenumber (400–1700 cm−1), which indicates the dramatically decreased signal of the sulfate group in the sandwich-type architecture.
Raman spectra were further used to characterize the carbon matrix in the hierarchical composite (Fig. S1†). Two characteristic signatures located at 1357 and 1589 cm−1 were observed for the hierarchical composite, corresponding to the D (disordered carbon) and G (graphene carbon) bands.39 The high intensity of the G band and the low value of the D/G intensity ratio demonstrate its high sp2 domain size. Therefore, all of the above results confirm that the Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O–graphene composite with a desirable crystal structure has been synthesized via a present low-temperature strategy.
The morphology and microstructure of the hierarchical composite were investigated by SEM and TEM observations. As shown in Fig. 3(d and e), the sulfate nanoparticles are encompassed by graphene sheets, which results in the hierarchical architecture of the composite. The enlarged parallel view of one layer (Fig. 3(a–c)) demonstrates that the nanoparticles with a diameter of 50–100 nm are well wrapped by a large graphene sheet and results in each layer with a hierarchical structure. The vertical view of the graphene network (Fig. 3(i)) reveals that the graphene sheets pile up layer by layer to construct a 3D conductive framework for stacking sulfate nanoparticles. It provides intimate contact between each other and builds continuous electron transport pathways. The vertical view of the hierarchical composite (Fig. 3(g and h)) further indicates that the nanoparticles are anchored on each graphene sheet on both sides, which forms the sandwich-type architecture of the composite. Moreover, the EDX result (Fig. 3(f)) suggests that the element ratio of Na:Fe:S for the hierarchical composite is 1.965:1:2.042, which coincides with the designed value. Therefore, the results demonstrate that the Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O–graphene composite with a hierarchical sandwich-type nanostructure has been successfully constructed.

Images of the whole sandwich-type nanostructure (d and e), one enlarged layer (a–c) and vertical view of the hierarchical composite (g and h) are illustrated. The corresponding schematic images are shown as insets of SEM images (a, d and g). The cross-sectional images of a pristine graphene network is illustrated in (i). 
In order to investigate the effects of hierarchial sandwich nanostructure on electronic transport capability for sulfates, the electronic conductivity of a hierarchical Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O–graphene composite and pristine Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O is estimated at room temperature. As displayed in Fig. 4(a), the linear fits of the current–voltage curves were obtained for both materials. The calculated electronic conductivity (σ) for the pristine Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O is about 9.4 × 10−15 s cm−1 at ambient temperature (Fig. 2(b)). The result is in agreement with the previously reported sulfates such as Li2Fe(SO4)2 (σ ∼ 10−16 s cm−1)26 and Li2Co(SO4)2 (monoclinic phase, σ ∼ 10−18 s cm−1; orthorhombic phase, σ ∼ 10−14 s cm−1).25 All these electronic conductivity values of the sulfates were much lower than the other polyanionic materials, for example, the most commonly LiFePO4:40σ ∼ 10−9 scm−1. Thus the poor conductivity has become one of the most serious problems for sulfates as electrode materials. Significant improvement was observed for the hierarchical composite, which increased to about 4.33 × 10−4 s cm−1 at room temperature. The enhanced conductivity is associated with the special architecture of the hierarchical composite. The graphene-based skeleton constructs a 3D conductive network for sulfates and the sandwich-type structure ensures the intimate contact between nanoparticles and the conductive network. Both facilitate electron transport and result in good conductivity. Thus the results confirm that the graphene-based sandwich hierarchical nanostructure is highly efficient in modifying poor electronic conductivity for sulfate-based materials.

High moisture sensitivity is another special character for sulfate-based compounds. It leads to easy structural deterioration during storage and restricts their practical applications. This problem is even serious for the bihydrate sulfate (Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O). In order to investigate the effects of sandwich-type architecture on the moisture sensitivity of sulfates, we expose both the pristine and hierarchical samples to ambient environment and compare their XRD patterns after different exposure times (Fig. 5(a)). Based on the refinement results of XRD patterns, the ratios of Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O and Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O phases in both samples are determined. As displayed in Fig. 5(b), the ratio of the Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O impurity phase in both samples initially dramatically increases with increasing exposure time. Then it slows down and finally becomes stable after two months. This result indicates that the structural deterioration of bihydrate sulfate is associated with the hydration reaction. Compared with the pristine material, less structural deterioration was observed for the hierarchical composite. After one month of air-exposure, the ratio of the Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O phase in the hierarchical sample is only half of the value for the pristine sample. Even after two months, there is still about two thirds of the original Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O phase in the hierarchical composite. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical composite has a higher ratio of Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O phase than the pristine one under the same exposure-time, which demonstrates its improved structural stability and depressed moisture sensitivity.
 Fig. 5  (a) XRD patterns of pristine Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O exposed to air for different times; (b) the change of ratio of Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O phase in the pristine material and hierarchical composite during air-exposure; (c) the relationship between the calculated apparent reaction rates and exposure time for both materials. A typical example for the calculation of an apparent reaction rate is shown in the inset. 
In order to investigate the process of hydration reaction, an apparent oxidation rate is calculated using the following equation: dv = dm/dt(1)where v is the apparent hydration rate; m is the mole ratio of the hydrated phase; t is the air exposure time.
The calculation results are summarized in Fig. 5(c) and a typical example calculation is displayed in the inset. For both samples, the apparent hydration rate initially decreases quickly as the air-exposure time increases. Then it becomes slow and finally stable. Compared with the pristine sample, the hierarchical one exhibits much lower hydration rates. On the other hand, the O1s XPS spectra of pristine sample suggest that the area of peaks corresponding to H2O and OH− after air-exposure is much higher than those of unexposed ones (Fig. S2†). It indicates that the contents of H2O and OH− on the particle surface increase during air-exposure. Therefore, both the apparent reaction rate and XPS spectra results suggest that the product of the hydrated reaction initially exists on the surface of the particle, which would prevent the hydration reaction to the inner part of particle and leads to a decreased reaction rate with increasing time.
The above results suggest a shell–core hydration mechanism which is depicted in Fig. 6(a and c). When the sulfate particle is exposed to the moisture-bearing air, water is absorbed on the surface of the particle and the hydration reaction thus takes place. Initially, the hydrated sulfate (Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O) scatters randomly on the surface of the particle of Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O. The surface occupied by the hydrated sulfate grows continuously until the entire outer surface is covered by the hydrated phase. The hydration rate in this process is proportional to the unhydrated surface area which continually decreases with the progression of the hydration reaction. When an outer “shell” of the hydrated phase is formed, the absorbed water molecules have to penetrate through the “shell” in order to reach the inner “core” of the sulfate, thus the hydration rate dramatically slows down upon further air exposure. The hydration rate in this stage is inversely proportional to the thickness of the “shell”. Therefore, the variation of the hydration rate predicated by the shell–core hydration mechanism is in accordance with that observed by the experimental measurements while the air exposure of the pristine sample is involved. This is an indication of the validity of the core–shell hydration mechanism.

For the hierarchical composite, the graphene nanosheet wrapped the sulfate particles, which decreases the opportunities of direct contact between the particle and the water molecule (Fig. 6(b)). Thus the sandwich-type structure effectively prevents the hydration reaction of sulfate particles, which results in an decreased apparent reaction rate. Therefore, the hierarchical composite exhibits better crystal structure stability, less moisture sensitivity and easier storage than the pristine one. By combining all of the above results, it indicates that the hierarchical sandwich-type nanoarchitecture is favorable to enhancing the electronic conductivity and suppressing the moisture sensitivity of the sulfate.
Inspired by the advantages of hierarchical sandwich-type architecture, the sodium and lithium ion intercalation chemistry of the hierarchical Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O–graphene composite was investigated. Fig. 7(a and b) shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge characteristics of the hierarchical composite in sodium and lithium systems, respectively. It exhibits electrochemical activities in both systems. For the sodium intercalation system (Fig. 7(a)), the composite exhibits an initially discharge capacity of 72 mA h g−1 at 0.05 C rate. One pair of charge and discharge potential plateaus is observed in the galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles, corresponding well to the oxidation (3.415 V vs. Na+/Na) and reduction (3.234 V vs. Na+/Na) peaks in the dQ/dV curve. The symmetrical redox potentials indicate the reversible redox reaction of Fe2+/Fe3+ in the hydrated sulfate (Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O), which agree well with those reported by Barpanda et al.30 The shape of galvanostatic curves changes slightly during cycles and it turns to be stable after five to ten cycles.
 Fig. 7  Galvanostatic charge–discharge characteristics of hierarchical Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O–graphene composite in (a) sodium and (b) lithium intercalation systems. The charge–discharge profiles of 1, 3, 5, 10 and 20 cycles (i), typical dQ/dV curve (ii) and cycling properties (iii) are displayed. 
Compared with the sodium system, the electrochemical behaviors of the sulfates in lithium intercalation system are different. As displayed in Fig. 7(b), it exhibits only a low discharge capacity of 59 mA h g−1 in the first cycle with a short and inconspicuous potential plateau. When the number of cycles is increased, both the discharge capacity and potential plateau gradually increase. After six cycles, the capacity reaches a maximum value of 69 mA h g−1. Then it turns to be stable and slightly decreases in the following cycles. The change of charge–discharge characteristics in the lithium system is associated with the structure alteration process of hybrid ion systems. Barker,41 Nazar42 and Banks43,44et al. have operated the sodium intercalated materials such as Na3V2(PO4)2F3, Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaVPO4F in a lithium based electrolyte and discovered hybrid ion batteries (HIB). Based on the rocking chair chemistry of HIB, the gradual capacity alteration process during initial cycles is associated with the initial temporary disorder induced by a hybrid de/insertion process, which would be suppressed and reformed by the predominant Li ion transport in the sequential cycles due to a vast excess of Li.41–44 And the stabilization suggests the completion of the transformation process. Therefore, the change of charge–discharge profiles in our study can be attributed to the transformation process from the hybrid ion (sodium and lithium) transport to the lithium dominated transport. Evidence from the ex situ XRD patterns also supports this intercalation process. As displayed in Fig. S3,† an obvious right shift was observed in the XRD patterns after the initial cycle, which suggests the alteration of the crystal volume during the initial cycle. Then the shift becomes slow and finally stable after five cycles. It suggests that the structure re-construction process takes place during the initial few cycles and completes after five cycles. The ex situ XRD results coincide well with the capacity change during cycles. Two well defined charge–discharge potential plateaus were observed in the charge–discharge profile after stabilization, which corresponds to the oxidation (3.579 V vs. Li+/Li) and reduction (3.483 V vs. Li+/Li) peaks in the dQ/dV curve. The redox potential in the lithium system is higher than that in the sodium system, which can be attributed to the different redox potentials of two alkaline metals. Therefore, all of the above results demonstrate that the Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O composite can be employed as the host material for Li as well as for Na.
Motivated by the good compatibilities of Na/Li ion, the high rate capability and cycling stability of both pristine and the hierarchical samples in sodium–lithium ion batteries were investigated. A series of current densities, from 0.05 C to 10 C, are employed to evaluate the rate capability. All of the rate capacity tests were carried out after five to ten precycles to eliminate the initial instability. As displayed in Fig. 8(a and d), in both lithium–sodium intercalation systems, similar capacities are observed for the pristine and hierarchical composites at a 0.05 C rate. When the current density is higher than 0.5 C, obvious higher capacity was observed for the hierarchical composite than the pristine one. As the current density increases, the differences between two samples become more significant. For example, the hierarchical composite delivers 63.5 and 49.6 mA h g−1 of the capacity at the 1 C and 10 C rates in sodium batteries. They are higher than those of the pristine material, which only delivers 58.4 and 35.2 mA h g−1 of capacity at 1 C and 10 C, respectively. Moreover, both materials exhibit better properties in the sodium ion system than those in the lithium ion system, especially at high rates (Fig. 8(b and e)). For example, the hierarchical composite exhibits a capacity of 55.3 and 39.4 mA h g−1 in sodium ion batteries at 5 C and 20 C rates, corresponding to 81% and 57% of the capacity at 0.05 C. These values are higher than those in lithium ion batteries, which are 47.9 and 27.1 mA h g−1 at 5 C and 20 C corresponding to only 70% and 40% of capacity at 0.05 C. The inferior properties of sodium-containing materials in lithium ion systems have also been observed in previous reports on Na3V2(PO4)3, NaCo(PO4)2P2O7, Na7V4(P2O7)4(PO4), etc.41–44 It is proposed to be associated with the structural change induced by a higher charge density of lithium ions, which worsens the high rate capability of the composite.

The galvoanostatic discharge curves of the hierarchical composite at different current densities in sodium (b) and lithium (e) systems. Long-term cycling properties of the hierarchical composite and pristine material at 5 C rate in sodium (c) and (f) lithium systems. 
On the other hand, the hierarchical composite also exhibits better cycling properties than the pristine one (Fig. 8(c and f)). At a 5 C rate, a higher cycling stability of 92% and 85% is obtained for the hierarchical composite in sodium and lithium systems, respectively, which is higher than those of the pristine ones (77% for sodium and 63% for lithium systems). On the basis of above results, the superb high rate properties and good cycling stability of the graphene–sulfate composite can be attributed to the advantages of the hierarchical sandwich-type architecture as illustrated in Fig. 1. The 3D graphene-based framework constructs a conductive network for the sulfates, which provides continuous electron/ion pathways and guarantees an effective electron contact upon prolonged cycling. Therefore, it is favorable to the fast electrochemical kinetics and stable cycling properties.
4 Conclusions
In summary, a graphene-based sandwich-type structure has been designed and fabricated to develop high-performance sulfate-based electrode materials. The hierarchical nanoarchitecture consisting of a 3D graphene network and sulfate nanoparticles effectively addresses the inherent problems such as intrinsically low electronic conductivity and high moisture sensitivity in the sulfate chemistry. As a case study, the hierarchical graphene–Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O composite was constructed. It exhibits good sodium–lithium insertion capability, superior high rate properties and depressed moisture sensitivity. The improved properties are attributed to a 3D conductive framework and hierarchical sandwich architecture, which provide continuous electronic pathways for fast kinetics and gives strong protection for sulfates against structural deterioration. Therefore, the graphene-based hierarchical sandwich-type architecture is demonstrated to be a promising approach for sulfate-based materials, in view of wide validity, superior electrochemical performance and easy storage.
