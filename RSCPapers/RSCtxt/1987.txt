    , Accepted 27th February 2020First published on 13th March 2020AbstractIn the past decade, photo-detectors have been demonstrated to have very important applications in image sensing, optical communication, fire detection, environmental monitoring, space exploration, safety detection, and many other scientific research and industrial technology fields and are regarded as the key components of wearable devices. Compared to traditional fabrication approaches, pulsed-laser deposition (PLD)-grown materials for photo-detectors offer several merits. First, PLD is a clean physical vapor deposition approach. A stoichiometric amount of atoms can be transferred from the target to the substrate, avoiding complicated and potentially dangerous chemical reactions. Furthermore, the PLD process is carried out in a high-vacuum environment. Therefore, almost no contaminants, such as catalysts, precursors, surfactants and by-products, will be introduced. Also, the thickness of the films can be controlled by simply manipulating the energy and pulse number of the pulsed laser. Furthermore, the fabrication temperature is relatively low, which is available to deposit materials on various substrates, even flexible ones. Most importantly, PLD is a deposition technology with large area coverage, which can produce centimeter-scale thin films, the planar geometry of which has significant potential for compact device integration with modern semiconductor techniques. Consequently, this review introduces the recent advances on the materials, fabrication, and application of pulsed-laser deposition for a variety of high-performance photo-detectors from an overall perspective. Moreover, the challenges and future development trends are discussed.
1. Introduction
Photo-detectors are optoelectronic devices that convert a light signal into an electrical signal. High-performance photo-detection is crucial for the scientific and industrial communities and is extensively applied in video imaging, optical communications, fire detection, biomedical imaging, environmental monitoring, space exploration, security, night vision and motion detection.1–6 Over the last few years, different functional materials ranging from zero-dimensional (0D) nanostructures to two-dimensional (2D) layered materials have been applied in various photo-detectors.6–12 Numerous methods, including exfoliation, hydro/solvothermal synthesis, solution synthesis, soft colloidal synthesis, sputtering, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), have been applied to fabricate 0D–2D materials for photo-detectors.13
Among them, PLD is a perfect method for preparing various 0D–2D materials on a large scale. It can transfer the target material to the substrate according to the stoichiometric ratio. Basically, the PLD process can be divided into two steps; first, when the laser hits the surface of the target, it produces numerous ions and neutral particles with high energy (more than 100 eV). These energetic particles form dense plasma plumes, which have temperature in the order of several thousand Kelvin. Second, the background gas buffers the plasma plumes, moderating their energy to an appropriate value (0.1–10 eV). These buffering plasma plumes bombard the substrate and adhere to it. They then diffuse, crystallize, nucleate and grow until they are finally assembled into a film.304
Compared to other fabrication approaches, PLD-grown materials offer several advantages for constructing high-performance photo-detectors.
First, it is a clean physical vapor deposition method. In the PLD process, a stoichiometric amount of atoms is transferred from the target to the substrate, avoiding complicated and potentially dangerous chemical reactions.16,233,250 Furthermore, the PLD process is carried out in a high-vacuum environment. Therefore, almost no contaminants, such as catalysts, precursors, surfactants and by-products, will be introduced. It is well known that contaminants can act as recombination centers, leading to the recombination of photo-generated carriers, which reduce the photo-current or responsivity.14,304 Here, responsivity is one of the crucial parameters of photo-detectors, which is defined as Rλ = Iph/PS, where P is the light PD, and S is the effective area of the photosensitive material.14
Secondly, the thickness of films ranging from 1 nm to several tens of nanometers can be precisely controlled by simply manipulating the energy and pulse number of the pulsed laser, which directly influence the 3 dB bandwidth of the photo-detector. Usually, the thinner the 2D material, the higher the bandwidth.14,15
Next, the trap is also a very important factor to influence the performance of photo-detectors. The crystal quality can be controlled by modulating the temperature of the substrate and the energy of the pulse laser to decrease the detrimental traps or produce suitable traps.269 The detrimental traps can reduce the photo-current, and thus reduces the responsivity, detectivity and external quantum efficiency (EQE).105 On the contrary, suitable traps not only improve the lifetime of the photo-generated carriers according to the photo-gating effect, but also broaden the photo-response wavelength.399 Here, detectivity (D*) is another important figure-of-merit, representing the ability of a photo-detector to detect weak optical signals, which can be calculated using the following equation D* = A1/2R/(2qId)1/2, where q and Id are the elementary charge and dark current, respectively. EQE is the ratio of photogenerated electrons collected outside of the device to the number of incident photons, expressed as EQE = hcRλ/λe, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, λ is the wavelength of excitation light, and e is the elementary electronic charge.14
Besides, the position of the materials can be accurately fixed by applying a mask during the PLD process, which is beneficial to precisely construct devices with planar or vertical hetero-structures according to the desired design and difficult to realize using other fabrication technologies.105
Most importantly, PLD is a deposition technology with large area coverage, which can produce centimeter-scale 2D thin films, the planar geometry of which has great significance potential for compact device-integration with modern semiconductor techniques.16,17,250,285
2. Different materials prepared by PLD for photo-detectors
2.1 Inorganic metal oxide material photo-detectors
For inorganic metal oxide materials, PLD has many merits including outstanding adhesion, controlled multi-component oxide membrane fabrication with generally the same elemental composition as that of the target, large deposition rate and high material output efficiency.13,18–20 It is also possible for PLD to deposit a homogeneous large area thin film if the substrate repeatedly crosses the path of the ablation plume.21 Owing to the ascending kinetic energies of the ionized and expelled laser plum species, PLD membranes have lower crystallization temperatures compared with those fabricated using other physical vapor deposition approaches.22

2.1.1 ZnO photo-detectors. 
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is suitable for the construction of ultraviolet (UV) photo-detectors due to its wide direct band gap of 3.37 eV and large exciton binding energy of 60 meV.23,24 Usually, ZnO nanostructures are prepared via aqueous solution technology,25–27 CVD,28–30 hydro-thermal technique,23,31–33 sputtering,34 and PLD.35–37 However, in contrast to other fabrication methods, PLD is and excellent method to prepare high-quality crystalline oxide materials due to the atomic-layer growth realized by adjusting the laser repetition rate. Additionally, the surface mobility of ad-atoms can be greatly improved by the high-energy source particles created by PLD.38–43 Consequently, PLD is more attractive for the fabrication of ZnO thin films and nanostructures than magnetron sputtering and reactive RF sputtering.44 For example, Sin-Liang Ou's group reported single crystalline ZnO nanorods by PLD using a chemical bath-deposited ZnS seed layer at temperatures of 500 °C, 700 °C, and 900 °C for application in UV detectors, as shown in Fig. 1(a).38 Tahani H. Flemban's group reported n-type ZnO nanotubes on a p-type Si(100) substrate prepared by PLD for the construction of a UV photo-detector, as shown in Fig. 1(b).45 B. Q. Cao's group reported ZnO nanowalls on sapphire substrates using high-pressure PLD without any catalysts for UV detectors, as shown in Fig. 1(c).46 In addition, ZnO thin films obtained via PLD for UV detectors have been reported.13,47

2.1.2 Zn1−xMgxO photo-detectors. 
As direct band-gap materials, Zn1−xMgxO composites possess many advantages for UV photo-detectors including availability of lattice-matched single crystal substrates,48,49 low deposition temperature,50 high absorption coefficient, abrupt absorption edge, high radiation hardness51 and tunable band-gap energy (3.3–7.8 eV).52–54 Next, the growth process used can regulate the bandgap of Zn1−xMgxO up to 4.0 eV. High-quality Zn1−xMgxO thin films have been fabricated via several methods such as PLD, molecular beam epitaxy, metal–organic chemical vapor deposition, and radio-frequency magnetron sputtering.55,56 With regards to ZnO, confining the solid solubility of Mg to 4 at% atom ratio is significant to maintain the hexagonal wurtzite structure for lattice-matching with ZnO substrates,57 which may be effectively surmounted by PLD because this process allows the preparation of solid–liquid membranes over the thermodynamic solution limit.58 Furthermore, PLD has become a common selective technology on account of its high production yield, low fabrication temperature, and broad range of preparation parameters for the domination and amelioration of membrane features. Additionally, its active layer properties, including boundary shape and depth, have an enormous influence on the performance of UV photo-detectors. The pulse repetition rate is significant to strengthen the deposit speed in order to optimize the depth to improve the UV responsivity.59 P. S. Shewale's group reported Mg0.05Zn0.95O nanorod array films grown on SiO2/n-Si substrates via PLD for UV detectors, as shown in Fig. 2(a).60 S. Han's group reported an MgZnO thin film solar-blind UV detector fabricated via PLD, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c).61,62 Hao Chen's group reported Mg0.47Zn0.53O thin film solar-blind photo-detectors fabricated via PLD, as shown in Fig. 2(d).63

2.1.3 β-Ga2O3 and TiO2 photo-detectors. 
β-Ga2O3 is an appealing candidate for excellent performance UV photo-detectors.400 However, on account of its spectrum response reaching the peak close to the band boundary and decreasing rapidly, achieving a wide band or multi-spectral UV sensor is still a major challenge.64 For the growth of β-Ga2O3 thin films, PLD is a perfect technique because atomic-layer control may be achieved through modulating of the laser repetition rate and the source particles possessing high energy to enhance the surface mobility of the ad-atoms.65 For example, Anisha Kalra's group reported epitaxial β-Ga2O3/GaN-based vertical metal–heterojunction–metal (MHM) broadband photo-detectors, as shown in Fig. 3(a).64 Fei-Peng Yu's group reported β-Ga2O3 thin film photo-detectors via PLD.65 Xiang He Chen's group reported a β-Ga2O3 thin film deep UV detector fabricated via PLD.66

Titanium oxide (TiO2), an intrinsically n-type wide indirect bandgap (3.2 and 3.0 eV for anatase and rutile phase, respectively) metal-oxide semiconductor, has been considered to be a perfect material for UV photo-detectors by virtue of its chemical stability, high refractive index and low cost.67–71 Because superior TiO2 films are imperative for good performance UV photo-detectors, various technologies have been applied to fabricate superior TiO2 films, including PLD,72–74 magnetron sputtering,75–77 atomic layer deposition78,79 and sol–gel method.80,81 Among them, PLD is an extensively applied technology, which can offer perfect epitaxial membranes with almost no defects by adjusting the relative deposition parameters, including the laser power and frequency, substrate temperature, growth rate, and elemental components.82 For example, Zifeng Zhang's group reported TiO2 thin film UV photo-detectors fabricated via PLD, as displayed in Fig. 3(b).67 Yanru Xie's group reported the fabrication of a TiO2 film on an MgF2 substrate for UV detectors by PLD, as displayed at Fig. 3(c).83


2.1.4 InGaZnO and In2O3/In2(TeO3)3 photo-detectors. 
Amorphous InGaZnO films have been extensively researched for a long time owing to their extensive applications in transparent thin film transistors (especially in flexible substrates), photo-detectors, etc..84–86 Benefiting from its superior properties over other materials including room temperature modification, large area uniformity, large band gap (>3.0 eV) and high electron mobility (1–30 cm2 V−1 s−1), InGaZnO has been applied to prepare UV detectors.84–92 H. T. Zhou's group reported a fast-response flexible ultraviolet photo-detector based on InGaZnO fabricated by PLD, as shown in Fig. 4(a).84

Jiandong Yao's group reported centimeter-scale In2O3/In2(TeO3)3 bulk hetero-junction membrane photo-detectors fabricated by PLD, as shown in Fig. 4(b),93 which exhibited the persistent photo-conductivity (PPC) effect and have potential for wide applications such as optoelectronic memory,94,95 photo-strengthened gas sensing,96–98 imaging,99 photo-catalysis,100,101 photo-voltaics102,103 and radiation detection.104

2.2 2D van der Waals material photo-detectors
Recently, benefiting from their significant properties of outstanding light–matter interaction,105–206 high carrier mobility,207 excellent flexibility,208 extensive bandgap range,209 high electrostatic domination210 and dangling bond-free surface,211 2D van der Waals materials (vdWMs), containing graphene (Gr),212 borophene,213 elemental group VA members,17,209,214,215 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs),216–218 group IIIA–VA,219–221 IIIA–VIA222–224 and IVA–VIA compounds,225,226 topological insulators (TIs),227–229 perovskites,230–232etc., have become prospective and fascinating candidates toward next-generation high-performance photo-detectors. However, a small area of photo-sensing 2D materials is impractical with mature silicon-based semiconductor techniques. Thus, currently, CVD, MBE, magnetron sputtering, and mechanical exfoliation are commonly used to prepare large-area 2D materials. However, the chemical atmosphere of the CVD process is complex and requires a high growth temperature (usually greater than 600 °C), which limits the use of substrates because of their high temperature resistance.270 Although transfer printing technology can transfer samples from high temperature-resistant substrates to non-high temperature-resistant substrates, this process not only inevitably results in the damage of 2D materials, but also introduces substrate residue and environmental pollution. Meanwhile, MBE can be applied to deposit good performance 2D materials, but it requires complicated equipment, which is based on expensive ultra-clean chamber manufacturing systems, and thus hinders its commercial popularization.233 Furthermore, magnetron sputtering is another important way to fabricate large-area 2D materials for photo-detectors, but it is not suitable for all materials because the sputtering energy is significantly lower than that of the pulse laser in the PLD process.16 Besides, mechanical exfoliation is an effective to obtain large-area 2D materials, but both the output and the successful ratio are very low.270 In contrast, PLD technology has many advantages for the preparation of large area and good property 2D materials for high performance photo-detectors.
Firstly, almost all 2D materials can be fabricated via PLD due to the strong energy of the pulse laser so that photo-detectors based on these 2D materials can cover a very broad wavelength range from deep UV to IR.288,301,302,304
Secondly, hetero-structures are a great way to modulate and realize different photo-response ranges. Planer and vertical hetero-structure photo-detectors can be directly fabricated by precisely fixing the position using a mask during the PLD process.105 Compared with the hetero-structures fabricated using other methods, such as the common CVD assisted transfer, van der Waals epitaxy growth based on CVD, and mechanical exfoliation, PLD is a cleaner physical vapor deposition process, which avoids complex fabrication processes and potential chemical pollution. Residual chemical pollution can cause harmful effects to the surface state, which are detrimental to the photo-absorbance performance of 2D materials.14,304 Furthermore, the successful ratio and output of the hetero-structures fabricated by PLD are significantly higher than that by other methods.105
Next, the thickness of 2D materials ranging from 1 nm to several tens of nanometers can be accurately controlled by simply manipulating the energy and pulse number of the pulsed laser,14,15 which directly influence the 3 dB bandwidth of photo-detectors. Usually, the thinner the 2D material, the higher the bandwidth. Besides, the thickness is directly related to the number of layers of 2D materials.403 Generally, the thicker the 2D material, the greater the number of layers. As the laser energy and the pulse number increase, both the number of bombarded atoms and their energy increase, which increases the number of atoms reaching the substrate, and thus leads to an increase in thickness.403 For example, Loh et al. obtained 2, 3 and 4–5 multilayer WS2 through PLD at laser energies of 50, 100 and 200 mJ, respectively.404 Furthermore, they synthesized 2D MoS2 with a controllable thickness (2–4 multilayers) by tuning the laser energy.405 Additionally, Siegel et al. used PLD to synthesize MoS2 with a thickness ranging from 60 multilayers down to 1 multilayer by merely tuning the laser pulse number from 3000 to 50.406 Moreover, Lau et al. synthesized black phosphorus (BP) ultrathin films by PLD, and the thickness ranging from 2 to 8 nm, corresponding to the band gap from 0.80 to 0.21–0.26 eV, was also controlled by the laser pulse number.407
Also, the temperature of the PLD process is relatively lowly, and 2D materials can be directly prepared on various substrates, even flexible substrates, which can avoid the destruction of samples by the transfer process and is more suitable for the development of flexible electronics and modern integrated electronics.16,340
Most importantly, PLD is convenient for the preparation of large area (wafer scale) 2D materials. Therefore, PLD will promote wearable photo-detectors and realize their commercial application.250,285

2.2.1 TMD photo-detectors. 
In the last few years, TMDs have been extensively applied in photo-detection due to their intense light–matter interaction and desirable semiconducting band gaps (1–2 eV).233–235 Generally, they are a family of layered materials composed of stacked covalently bonded X–M–X (M = Mo, W, Nb, Ta, Ti, and Re and S = S, Se, Te) molecular layers assembled together by weak van der Waals interactions.
Among the family of TMDs, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is representative and has been the most widely investigated. MoS2 has a tunable bandgap depending on its thickness, which means that bulk MoS2 has an indirect bandgap of 1.2 eV and monolayer MoS2 has a direct bandgap of 1.8 eV due to the quantum confinement effect.234,236–238 An atomic layer of MoS2 is feasible for photo-detectors owing to its outstanding photo-sensing performances, including strong resonant light absorption (>20%) and high quantum luminescence efficiency.235,239–248 Layered MoS2 can be successfully deposited via PLD on various substrates including quartz (single crystal), SiO2 (amorphous), and HfO2 (polycrystalline)249,250 because PLD can effectively control the imperfections in the sample and decrease the bandgap by the radiation pulses by virtue of the lower mass of S ions than that of Mo ions.249,251,252 Ying Xie's group reported an ultra-broadband MoS2 photo-detector with a spectral response in the range of 445 to 2717 nm, which was fabricated by PLD.249 Dattatray J. Late's group investigated the photo-response and field emission of MoS2 thin films on W and Si fabricated by PLD, as shown in Fig. 5(a).253

Among the typical TMDCs, WS2 has a high optical absorption coefficient of 105–106 cm−1,254,255 a layer-dependent band gap of 1.3–2.05 eV,256 and large exciton binding energies in the range of 700–800 meV.257,258 Theoretical calculations also revealed that the room temperature phonon-limited electron mobility of monolayer WS2 can be as high as 1103 cm2 (V s)−1.259 Consequently, photo-detectors based on mechanically exfoliated WS2 nanosheets exhibit high responsivity in the range of 0.1 A W−1 to 5.7 A W−1.206,260–262 However, they have limited functional device application on account of the lateral dimensions of exfoliated sheets being restrained to hundreds of micrometers, and the randomness of their shape, thickness and crystal quality.233 Electronic-grade WS2 films, which are necessary for imaging pixels and display applications requiring large arrays of photo-detectors, are unattainable by virtue of the uncontrollability and low productivity of the mechanical exfoliation technique. Currently, CVD has been successfully applied to achieve large-area WS2 sheets.263 Nevertheless, the output of CVD is so small that CVD-fabricated WS2 flakes are generally monolayered or few layered rather than the favorable multilayered, which seriously restricts their optical absorbance. Furthermore, the CVD grown WS2 layers generally exhibit a low carrier mobility in the range of 0.01 to 0.91 cm2 V−1 s−1 as a result of severe scattering. This scattering possibly results from the external environment, e.g. the adsorbate at the top surface, the phonons induced by the vibration of the absorbate and the trapped defects generated by the SiO2 at the bottom surface.264 Consequently, photo-detectors based on CVD grown WS2 layers show a low responsivity with a magnitude of μA W−1 even with the help of a large electric field.265,266 Compared with the mechanical exfoliation method and CVD, PLD is a large-area coverage deposition technology, which can reproduce the components of the target accurately onto the substrate. J. D. Yao's group reported stable, highly responsive and broadband photo-detection in the range of 370 to 1064 nm based on large-area multilayered WS2 films grown by PLD.233 They also reported the promotion of the photo-sensitivity and detectivity of a Bi/Si hetero-junction photo-detector by inserting a WS2 layer grown by PLD, as shown in Fig. 5(b).17
In air, bulk WSe2 is a p-type semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 1.2 eV, whereas its monolayer exhibits a direct band gap of 1.65 eV.267 Under vacuum, WSe2-based devices show n-type or ambipolar behavior.401,402 The CVD method has been successfully applied to fabricate large-area WSe2 sheets;268 however, the output of this method is relatively low and the sheets synthesized are exhibit low carrier mobility generated by serious scattering. Besides, the fabricated photo-detectors also exhibit low photo-currents, which mean that the devices have weak anti-interference abilities. Zhaoqiang Zheng's group reported a flexible, transparent and ultra-broadband photo-detector based on a large-area WSe2 film fabricated by PLD for wearable devices, as shown in Fig. 5(c).16
However, theoretical research clearly indicates that the binary TMDs mentioned above may be subjected to high defect concentrations, especially chalcogen vacancies, which can result in the formation of localized deep-level defect states (DLDSs),269–272 significantly affecting the photo-response of the devices.273,274 Accordingly, alloy engineering is expected to be a suitable solution to suppress DLDSs.269,270 The isomorphism of layered material families (MX2: M = Mo and W; and X = S, Se, and Te) makes them prospective candidates to form ternary layered alloys, which are not be subjected to phase separation.275 Theoretical studies have shown that alloyed Mo0.5W0.5Se2276 and Mo0.5W0.5S2277 are thermodynamically more stable than their binary counterparts, which is of special significance to suppress the formation of binary byproducts during the deposition process. Furthermore, compared with that of photo-detectors based on binary layered materials, experiments have verified that layered material alloys exhibit larger and more uniform band alignment in photo-sensing devices, which are propitious to improve the device properties.278,279 Currently, several methods such as mechanical exfoliation280 and CVD281,282 have been applied to obtain layered substance alloys. Unfortunately, the output of mechanical exfoliation is too low, and the size and shape of the products are uncontrollable.233 Moreover, high temperature (>600 °C) is necessary in the CVD process, which restricts the substrates used for the direct growth of layered substance alloys.14,270,283 To overcome these difficulties towards extensive applications in integrated devices and systems, PLD has been certified to be an effective technique for the direct deposition of large-area and high-quality layered material alloys. J. D. Yao's group reported Mo0.5W0.5S2 alloy films fabricated by PLD for photo-detectors, possessing a stable photo-response in the range of 370 to 1064 nm, and the device achieved a good responsivity of 5.8 W−1 and a response time shorter than 150 ms, as shown in Fig. 5(d).269 Z. Q. Zheng's group reported a centimeter-scale Mo0.5W0.5Se2 alloy film fabricated by PLD for high performance photo-detectors for broad-band photo-detection in the ultraviolet to near-infrared region (370–808 nm), as shown in Fig. 5(e).270


2.2.2 IIIA–VIA compound photo-detectors. 
In recent years, layered materials, group IIIA–VIA (GaS,284 InSe,285 and In2Se3286) have attracted extensive attention by virtue of their unique 2D structures with especially great surface areas.287,288 These materials have many amazing performances, including outstanding light–matter interaction, excellent flexibility, highly carrier mobility, extended band gap range, and layer-dependent electronic and optical features, which make them potential materials for optoelectronics applications.287
Among the 2D IIIA–VIA compounds, bulk γ-InSe has a direct band gap (Eg = 1.26 eV) at room temperature, which can reach up to 2.11 eV for its monolayer on account of the quantum confinement effect,285,289–296 exhibiting a large band gap range from the visible to infrared region, which is equal to that of phosphorene. Additionally, since InSe has a smaller electron effective mass (m* = 0.143 mo)289 than MoS2, electronic devices based on InSe layers exhibit higher mobility of over 1 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature on account of weak electron–phonon scattering.294,295 Recently, the quantum Hall effect (QHE) has also been observed in few-layer InSe in an argon environment, indicating that this material is suitable for electron transport devices with desirable properties.294 Moreover, due to the merits of high thermal stability (∼660 °C) and good photo-response of InSe,292,293 few-layer InSe nanosheets were applied to fabricate a flexible photo-detector with excellent responsivity.192 However, to the best of our knowledge, the fabrication approaches for few-layer InSe are only restricted to mechanical exfoliation289–295 and liquid exfoliation,296 which both fabricate nanosheets with small and uncontrollable sizes. Moreover, since ultra-thin InSe is very sensitive to the chemical species, chemical strategy-based technology is unsuitable for the fabrication of InSe layers. Thus, Zhibin Yang's group reported the direct growth of wafer-scale layered InSe nanosheets by PLD.285
Layered In2Se3 materials have drawn great attention by virtue of their exotic electronic and optical features containing strong light–matter interaction,297 efficient light absorption,298 and large surface-to-volume ratio.286 These physical features make layered materials attractive for application in optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting devices, and photo-detectors.4,209,234,287,299,300 Furthermore, the existence of a direct band-gap in the bulk form makes In2Se3 a wonderful material in optoelectronic applications.301 Z. Q. Zheng's group reported on the growth of centimeter-scale high-quality In2Se3 films by PLD for transparent, flexible and high performance photo-detectors, as shown in Fig. 6(a).14 They fabricated β-In2Se3 on Si by PLD, and reported a self-assembled high-performance UV-visible-NIR broadband β-In2Se3/Si photo-detector array for weak signal detection, as shown in Fig. 6(b).288 By decorating nanodiamonds on In2Se3 fabricated by PLD, this group realized a hybrid NDs–In2Se3 photo-detector, as shown in Fig. 6(c).302 Furthermore, using the PLD method, this group also achieved In2Se3/CuInSe2-based photo-detectors with a lateral p–n hetero-junction, as shown in Fig. 6(d).301

α-In2Te3 has many merits for application in photo-detection. Firstly, it possesses a narrow band-gap of ca. 1–1.2 eV, which is suitable for broad band photo-detection in the UV to NIR range.303 Simultaneously, its semiconducting band gap can effectively suppress the formation of thermally excited carriers, and thus a large photo-to-dark current ratio can be achieved. Also, because its band gap is close to that of Si (1.12 eV), α-In2Te3 holds great potential as an alternative candidate material for post-silicon electronics.304 Secondly, α-In2Te3 is a stable phase in ambient conditions, which establishes the foundation for its further widespread commercial applications. Thirdly, α-In2Te3 possesses a high absorption coefficient of over 1 × 105 cm−1,305 which is several times higher than that of the traditional semiconductor Si,306 indicating its strong light–matter interaction. Thus, the above advantages make α-In2Te3 stand out compared to other emerging photo-detection materials.304 Nevertheless, most of the reported devices are fabricated from irregularly distributed nanostructures, which are the representative morphology for chemical synthesis methods.307 Thus, they cannot be further batch processed as integrated devices by virtue of their limited sizes and low maneuverability. Furthermore, the previously reported synthetic approaches for α-In2Te3 are time-consuming (normally tens of hours),308–311 which further limits its extensive application. Simultaneously, the sophisticated chemical synthetic approaches unavoidably induce various impurities containing precursors, surfactant and byproducts.309,312,313 Consequently, the figures-of-merit of the α-In2Te3 photo-detectors are quite poor (R ≈ 0.05 to 1 A W−1, D ≈ 5 × 109 to 1 × 1011 cm Hz1/2 W−1), which lags far behind that of the state-of-the-art commercial Si and Ge photo-detectors (R ≈ 0.5 to 0.85 W−1, D ≈ 3 × 1011 to 3 × 1012 cm Hz1/2 W−1).314 Compared with chemical synthesis processes, PLD is a clean technology for the growth of high-quality, large area α-In2Te3 thin films.301 For example, Jiandong Yao's group reported a stable, fast UV-vis-NIR photo-detector based on α-In2Te3 films fabricated by PLD, as shown in Fig. 6(e).304
Gallium selenide (GaSe) is a typical example of a layered material made of covalently bonded sheets of Se–Ga–Ga–Se layers,315,316 and is extensively applied in the optics,317 optoelectronics,318–320 and terahertz areas.321,322 GaSe has D3h symmetry with a lattice constant of 0.374 nm.315 GaSe is typically a p-type semiconductor with an indirect band-gap of 2.11 eV, which is only 25 meV lower than its direct band-gap.315 Currently, the electrical transport and photo-response of exfoliated318,323 and vapor phase319 deposited GaSe have been reported, indicating their outstanding performances in optoelectronic devices.318,319,323 Masoud Mahjouri-Samani's group reported photo-responsive two-dimensional GaSe nanosheet networks fabricated by PLD, as shown in Fig. 6(f).315


2.2.3 Topological insulator photo-detectors. 
Topological insulators (TIs), a new phase of quantum matter, possess an insulating gap in the bulk and spin momentum-locked Dirac cones on their surfaces.324–326 This type of metallic surface state is experimentally proven to be protected by time-reversal symmetry and robust against nonmagnetic perturbation.327,328 Currently, Zhang et al. predicted that the TI Dirac-like surface state can result in a strong optical absorption, which makes TIs excellent materials for broadband photo-detection in the infrared to the terahertz region.329 Shao et al. reported that the observed warping effect in Bi2Te3319 and Bi2Se3330 could further improve the device property.331 Moreover, TIs exhibit especially high surface mobility experimentally332 and have been proven to be effective electrodes, like graphene. To date, many fabrication approaches such as PLD,333 CVD,334 metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD),335 and MBE have been demonstrated for the fabrication of various topological insulator substances.336,337 However, compared with other fabrication methods, PLD has many advantages such as procedure, short time, and no contamination. For example, Jiandong Yao's group reported the ultra-broadband and high response of a Bi2Te3–Si hetero-junction photo-detector fabricated by PLD, as shown in Fig. 7(a).324 They also reported the polarization-dependent photo-current in the Bi2Te3 photo-detector fabricated by PLD, as shown in Fig. 7(b).229 Additionally, this group reported a layered-material WS2/Bi2Te3 hetero-structure fabricated by PLD for photo-detectors with a photo-response from 370 to 1550 nm, as shown in Fig. 7(c).338

2.2.4 IVA–VIA compound photo-detectors. 
Among the 2D vdWMs, most of the group IVA metal chalcogenides (GIVMCs, metal = Ge, Sn, and Pb and chalcogen = S, and Se) have emerged as promising and compelling candidates for broadband and high performance photo-detectors by virtue of their great carrier mobility (>230 cm2 V−1 s−1), high absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1) and relatively narrow band gap range (<2 eV). Moreover, this group of semiconductors is composed of earth-abundant and environmental-friendly elements with outstanding chemical stability, making them especially attractive for practical applications.339
SnS is a direct or indirect band gap (1.07–1.3 eV) semiconductor with an absorption coefficient of 5 × 104–5.7 × 105 cm−1 and carrier mobility of 104–3.8 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is even superior to that of black phosphorus, making it an ideal candidate for application in infrared photo-detectors. Layered SnS exhibits anisotropic properties, which contribute to its anti-reflection characteristics, resulting in high photo-activity and strain-tunable optic-electronic features for the fabrication of excellent flexible photo-detectors. Jiandong Yao's group reported an all-2D Bi2Te3-SnS-Bi2Te3 photo-detector prepared by PLD.340
SnSe is a direct or indirect band gap (0.9–1.3 eV) semiconductor with an absorption coefficient of 2 × 104–9.5 × 104 cm−1 and carrier mobility of 104 cm2 V−1 s−1. Importantly, this band gap value connects the bandgap blank between the mostly researched semi-metallic (e.g., 0–0.3 eV for Gr and black phosphorus) and semiconducting vdWMs (e.g., 1.2–2.1 eV for TMDCs), making it practical to compensate for the limitations of photo-detectors. Additionally, it possesses an absorption edge of 1381 nm, which contains the broadly researched O band (1310 nm). Jiandong Yao's group reported an all-layer 2D Bi2Te3-SnSe-Bi2Te3 photo-detector fabricated by PLD, as shown in Fig. 7(d).105


2.2.5 Perovskite photo-detectors. 
In photo-voltaic cells, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have received attractive attention as promising compositions for the development of next-generation solar cells.341–344 These materials, exhibiting several merits including extensive light absorption, direct band gap, large charge carrier mobility and large exciton diffusion length, exhibited significant advances recently with improved power transforming productivity from 3.8% up to 20.1%.343–346 Currently, there have been several reports on mesoporous, planar, multi-layer hetero structure configurations obtained by various fabrication methods.347–350 Recently, several approaches including the solution method and dual vapor phase growth have been reported for the preparation of membranes.348,349,351,352 However, a major bottleneck is the use of these materials for the synthesis of high quality membranes. PLD technology is feasible for metal oxide-based sophisticated perovskite systems, and transfer from the bulk to a membrane with the primary stoichiometry is the chief advantage of this approach.341 For example, Umesh Bansode's group reported MAPbI3 films grown by PLD for solar cell and photo-sensor applications, as shown in Fig. 7(e), and the device had an impressive performance over the broad wavelength range of 375 to 800 nm at a voltage bias of 5 V.353 Nagabhushan Pael's group reported the fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3 membranes by PLD for photo-detection applications, as shown in Fig. 7(f).341

2.3 Other material photo-detectors

2.3.1 II–VI material photo-detectors. 
Broad-bandgap II–VI composites containing CdTe, ZnTe, CdSe, ZnSe, and CdS are typically applied for visible light detection. Among these semiconductors, CdS is the best substance for visible response on account of its primary band gap of 2.4 eV (516 nm) and perfect response.354–361 CdS nanowires exhibit prominent photo-sensing in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet spectral regions. The CVD method is the main way to synthesize CdS nanowires, but it introduces contamination such as catalysts. In contrast, PLD is a relatively clean method, which can solve this problem effectively. Byung-GiAn's group reported a highly sensitive photo-sensor based on in situ-synthesized CdS nanowires fabricated by PLD, as shown in Fig. 8(a).354

CdTe possesses a near-ideal bandgap (direct transition) of 1.44 eV at 300 K, which is the optimum value for solar energy conversion. Moreover, CdTe is crystallographically steady,362,363 and thus its tandem structure provides the probability of fabricating effective and steady photo-voltaic devices.364 CdTe films have been successfully fabricated using various technologies including PLD.365,366 However, the primary merit of the PLD process is that the stoichiometry of the CdTe films is entirely protected.367 In addition, this compound does not produce severe problems with particle formation in the PLD plume. Raid A. Ismail's group reported the optoelectronic performances of the CdTe/Si hetero-junction synthesized by PLD, as shown in Fig. 8(b).362


2.3.2 IV group material photo-detectors. 
Ge quantum dots (QD) are significant for the construction of mid-infrared photo-detectors.368–370 Ge QDs were fabricated on Si by MBE,371 CVD,372 and liquid phase epitaxy (LPE).370 Nevertheless, very few works have applied PLD to synthesize Ge on Si and construct functional devices. PLD is an excellent technology for the fabrication of membranes by virtue of its desirable characteristics including the protection of stoichiometry, ease to synthesize multi layered membranes, capability to fabricate membranes from any substance, morphology-strengthening effect of the high energy fabricated grains, and periodic nature that enables surface relaxation between pulses.368 Without the need for any residual gases or doping sources, the first two properties allow the fabrication of multi layered devices with different compounds or doping just by using targets with the desired doping, which should result in a reduction in the growth time. Mohammed Hegazy's group reported Ge quantum-dot infrared photo-detector fabricated by PLD, as shown in Fig. 8(c).368


2.3.3 Other material photo-detectors. 
Amorphous nitrogen doped carbon (a-C:N) membranes have attracted increasing attention from some scientists owing to their perfect performances including transparency in IR and NIR regions, low electron affinity, chemical inertness, high hardness, and large band gap semiconductor.373–378 Important efforts has been paid to fabricate carbon nitride using physical and chemical approaches, including magnetron sputtering deposition,379,380 ion beam-assisted deposition,381 PLD, and CVD.56,382 PLD technology has been extensively applied to fabricate a-C:N membranes. The primary merits of this technology compared with the other methods are the synthesis of active membranes in an extensive pressure range, no need for high fabrication temperature, good membrane adhesion, and desired membrane stoichiometry.383 Raid A. Ismail's group reported the effect of nitrogen pressure on the performance of an a-C:N/p-Si photo-detector fabricated by PLD, as shown in Fig. 8(d).373
Currently, beside ZnO, GaN, and diamond, fluorides384–386 have been applied to construct photo-conductive detectors for solar-insensitive UV detection. The primary merit of fluorides is their broad band gap. Consequently, fluorides such as CeF3 provide an extensive choice of sophisticated compositions with broad band gaps and identical crystal structures, and it is possible to obtain the desired band structure, band gap, and lattice constant.387,388 Mirai Ieda's group fabricated CeF3 thin films by PLD for ultraviolet detectors, which showed a response in the wavelength region under 310 nm without any filters, and the measured dielectric-breakdown field of this detector was over 15 kV cm−1.384
Additionally, due to the quantum confinement-induced tunability of their band gap over an energy range as wide as 0.4–2 eV and the multiple exciton generation (MEG) phenomenon, PbS QDs exhibit an interesting photo-response.390 However, their high resistivity limits their ability to transport charges efficiently, and thus the construction of nanohybrids with 1D or 2D materials become a necessary method to improve their transporting charge efficiency. Furthermore, the synthesis of PbS QDs through chemical methods requires the use of ligands, which are very poor electrical conductors, and thus hinder charges transport between the PbS QDs and 1D or 2D materials.391 Therefore, M. A. El Khakani's group reported the use of the pulsed laser deposition method to directly decorate PbS QDs on appropriately single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs), leading to the formation of SWCNTs/PbS QD and DWCNTs/PbS QD nanohybrids photoconductor detectors, respectively, avoiding the use of the chemical method and ligands.390–392 In these nanohybrids systems, the PbS QDs were used as the light absorbers and charge generators, whereas the SWCNTs and DWCNTs act as efficient charge conveyors. The photocurrent and EQE properties of the photo-detectors based on the nanohybrid systems were significantly improved compared with that of the single PbS QDs and SWCNTs, as shown in Fig. 8(e) and (f), respectively.

3. Conclusion and outlook
Owing to its many advantages described above, such as clean fabrication process, short time, low growth temperature, size and thickness manipulation, large-area deposition, high quality production, good compatibility with various types of substrates, suitability for the fabrication of 0D, 1D, and 2D materials with different morphologies, and available of various kinds of materials ranging from metal oxide and van der Waals layer materials to other carbon or fluorides materials (the parameters of the different types of photo-detectors fabricated via PLD described above are summarized in Table 1), PLD has promoted the development of all types of high-performance photo-detectors, such as self-powered, photo-voltage, photo-conductor, photo-sensor, photo-switching, photo-transistor, persistent photo-conductivity, broadband, solar blind, UV, visible, IR, and polarization photo-detectors.

However, several drawbacks exist for PLD. Firstly, the PLD setup is not facile or easy to install since it requires vacuum equipment and expensive electronics to regulate the power necessary for laser pulse generation and control. Next, although PLD is used to deposit hetero-structures and stoichiometric thin films, sometimes, the deposited surfaces suffer from non-uniformity arising from submicron particulate deposition.394–397 Besides, increasing the PLD throughput is always via implementation of multi-target pulse deposition. Thus, PLD systems are often custom-made and tailored for specific projects with targeted funding.398 Finally, it tends to produce multi-crystals rather than single crystals during, which induces a large barrier at the interfaces of the crystals. Therefore, the carrier mobility in the multi-crystal is lower than that in the single crystal. This leads to relatively slower transition velocity for the carriers to promote recombination and suppress the responsivity. Additionally, the large barrier causes numerous electrons to accumulate at the interface of the crystals. Also, under the effect of a big current, the devices are easy to breakdown, which influences the stability.
During the PLD process, the time for the laser acting on the target is very short, and the thermal-dynamic process experienced by materials is very sophisticated. On the other hand, the surface-to-volume ratio of 0D–2D materials is very large, and thus the surface state is very rich, and tiny temperature fluctuations and slight atmosphere turbulence influence the deposition of the materials. Therefore, optimization of the PLD technology to realize single crystal fabrication is very significant. Firstly, it is necessary to precisely manipulate the atmosphere and the deposition temperature and systematically analyze the influence of the different PLD technological parameters on various materials. Subsequently, it is crucial to study the mechanism of different deposition conditions, such as temperature of the substrates, background pressure, energy density of laser, and pulse number, dynamically controlling the thin film deposition process. Besides, it is important to assist the thermal process such as combine annealing methods, annealing pressure and annealing temperature with PLD to realize single crystal growth, ensuring the materials work steadily and ultimately, realizing high-stability photo-detectors. Consequently, if this bottleneck is overcome, PLD will become perfect fabrication technology for all materials and devices compared with other methods.
In the future, there is much potential for the PLD method to be applied in photo-detectors. Firstly, it is significant to fabricate materials that have not been realized by PLD, such as most of the IVA–VIA semiconductors and TMDCs, for the construction of photo-detectors. For example, Zhibin Yang's group reported field-effect transistors based on black phosphorus ultra-thin films fabricated by PLD;389 however, a photo-detector based on black phosphorus prepared by PLD has not been demonstrated to date. Secondly, it is essential to further improve the responsivity, external quantum efficiency and detectivity, enhance the photo absorption, shorten the response time, and broaden the photo-response range to optimize the performance of photo-detectors by constructing novel planar or vertical hetero-structure photo-detectors directly through PLD method. Next, it is crucial to replace the traditional metal bulk electrodes or current fashionable graphene electrodes with topological insulator electrodes prepared by PLD to develop all-layered 2D photo-detectors, efficiently suppressing undesirable backscattering and facilitating conductance unimpeded channels to improve responsivity.105 Most importantly, constructing large-area and high performance flexible photo-detectors by PLD to meet the urgent developing demand of wearable devices can significantly promote the development of flexible optoelectronics. Based on the great progress already achieved, growing interest and input in this field, we believe that advanced pulse laser deposition technology will play important roles to further optimize current photo-detectors and construct new types in the near future.
