    , Accepted 3rd September 2012First published on 6th September 2012AbstractThe synthesis, characterization and catalytic capability of the NiW–nano-hydroxyapatite (NiW–nHA) composite were investigated in this paper. The NiW–nHA catalyst was prepared by a co-precipitation method. Then Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) were used to analyze this material. In addition, the catalytic capacity of the NiW–nHA composite was also examined by FT-IR and gas chromatography (GC). The results of FT-IR analysis indicated that Ni, W and nHA combined closely. TEM observation revealed that this catalyst was needle shaped and the crystal retained a nanometer size. XRD data also suggested that a new phase of CaWO4 appeared and the lattice parameters of nHA changed in this system. nHA was the carrier of metals. The rates of Ni/W-loading were 73.24% and 65.99% according to the EDX data, respectively. Furthermore, the conversion of 91.88% Jatropha oil was achieved at 360 °C and 3 MPa h−1 over NiW–nHA catalyst. The straight chain alkanes ranging from C15 to C18 were the main components in the production. The yield of C15–C18 alkanes was up to 83.56 wt%. The reaction pathway involved hydrocracking of the CC bonds of these triglycerides from Jatropha oil. This paper developed a novel non-sulfided catalyst to obtain a “green biofuel” from vegetable oil.
Introduction
With the development of renewable energy sources, wind power,1 solar cell,2 fuel cell3 and biomass4 have proved to be the most important. Biofuel5 could be used directly in compression ignition engines without modifications.6 It is attracting more and more attention. Using vegetable oil as liquid biofuel has several advantages over other alternative fuel options. The vegetable oils are renewable resources in nature.7–9 It is also cheap and environment-friendly for green fuel.10 In particular, Jatropha11,12 easily grows in almost any wasteland, even on sandy, saline soils, or stony and gravelly ground. This plant could yield much more biofuel per hectare than those from soybean, sunflower, and canola.13
Hydrotreatment has been developed to produce the straight chain alkanes from the fatty acid triglycerides of Jatropha oil.14 The catalyst of the reaction is critical. Metal sulfide catalysts (Ni–Mo,15 Ni–W,16 and Ni–La17) have been widely used for vegetable oil hydroprocessing, while commonly used carriers are SiO2,18 Al2O3,19 TiO220 or a combination thereof.21 However, these traditional carriers are limited due to their small poor activity.22 In addition, to improve cracking performance, the conventional catalysts are commonly sulfided, which would bring great harm to the environment, human health and instrument.10,23,24 Therefore, it is necessary to design a novel catalyst that has excellent hydrocracking activity without presulfurization.
Biofuels produced by nano-materials have significant advantages over the conventional methods.25,26 Nanosized materials27–29 offer different morphology and enhanced surface area that could yield better reaction rates. Nanosized hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) is widely used in biomaterials due to its biocompatibility and bioactivity.30–33 It is the main inorganic component of the hard tissues and providing direct chemical bonds with Ca2+, OH− and PO43− groups.34 HA is the most basic calcium orthophosphate,35 which is insoluble in neutral and basic medium. Reported data36–38 indicate that nHA could adsorb divalent metals.39 The mechanisms of the cation retention include: ion exchange,40,41 absorption,42 precipitation,43 and surface complexation.44 In particular, the Ca–I site of nHA is preferred energetically for divalent metal substitution, such as Zn2+, Mg2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Ba2+, Cd2+ and so on.45 nHA could load much more metals in order to increase active sites. Thus, it is an ideal carrier substituted traditional supporter. Therefore, our intention is to prepare a non-sulfide catalyst that combines the favorable characteristics of nHA and hydrocracking activity of Ni and W. In the new system, nHA carries Ni and W, forming an integration of supporter and metal activity. This metal-based catalyst has potential for hydrocracking “green fuel” from Jatropha oil.
In this study, a NiW–nHA composite was prepared by a co-precipitation method without presulfurization. The properties of this catalyst were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). In addition, we investigated hydrotreatment of Jatropha oil over NiW–nHA catalyst. Hydrocracking assays were also discussed.
Experimental
Preparation of materials
NiW–nHA composite was synthesized by a co-precipitation method. All the chemical reagents used in this work were analytic reagent (AR). Briefly, calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2), nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2), ammonium metatungstate hydrate ((NH4)6W7O24) and trisodium phosphate (Na3PO4) were dissolved in water. Then the Na3PO4 solution was titrated into the [Ca–Ni–W] solution at a Ca/P molar ratio of 1.67. The titrated solution was vigorously stirred and the pH was adjusted to 10 by ammonia solution (NH4·OH). In addition, reaction temperature was kept at 25 °C. After titration, the stirring was continued for 5 hours and then the obtained slurry was aged for another 24 hours. Finally, the precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water. Lastly, the calcination was carried out by sintering at 400 °C for 6 h.
For control, nHA was prepared by a wet method.46
Material characterization
Chemical analysis of the composite was carried out by a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometer (FTIR 650) in the range from 4000 cm−1 to 400 cm−1 at 1.5 cm−1 resolution averaging 32 scans.
The microstructure of the NiW–nHA composite was observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JME-100CX).
XRD was used to determine the structure of the catalyst. These measurements were performed with a Empyrean XRD analyzer (Cu Kα) and PIXcel3D detector from PANalytical Company. These samples were measured in the 2θ range from 5° to 80° (scan speed of 0.02° per second).
Catalyst assay

Jatropha oil was purchased from Jiangsu Donghu Bioenergy Co. Ltd. The reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor (FBR) at 360 °C and 400 °C, 3 MPa, LHSV (liquid hourly space velocity) of 1 h−1 and a ratio of H2 to oil in feed of 500 mL mL−1. The hydrocarbon yields and products were collected in a trap and were characterized by FT-IR and gas chromatography (GC). The gas-phase products were collected once for every reaction condition and analyzed offline using a standard three-column GC setup with flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors enabling the detection of both permanent gases and hydrocarbons at the same time.
Results and discussion
FT-IR analysis
IR spectra of nHA, NiW–nHA composite and NiW–nHA composite powders sintered at 400 °C are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the major bands of HA associated with PO43− (1094, 1036, 965, 602 and 567 cm−1) and OH− (3568 and 628 cm−1) appeared in all of the materials. But there were some changes in the frequencies of PO43− and OH−, shifting to low wavenumbers in the composite. This movement indicated that the positive end of the OH− dipole approaches the negative VCa47 (vacancy of Ca) which contributed to the wavenumber shift.
The frequencies of 919 cm−1 and 813 cm−1 were assigned to the characterization of WO42−,48 which affected the frequencies of PO43− and OH− after metals were added to nHA. The IR spectra also show the bands attributed to CO32− (1350–1450 cm−1). According to the report of Kumar et al.,49 B-type (CO32− for PO43−) substituted HA were also present in this NiW–nHA composite (Fig. 1b and c). This change was a result of tungsten atom coordination with the oxygen of PO43−groups. Meanwhile, the sorption of Ni and W was probably favored by suitable O–O separation between the PO43− groups of nHA, which has bidentate coordination. Thus, three phases of nHA, Ni and W combined closely in this novel composite.

TEM observation
The TEM image (Fig. 2) illustrated that the NiW–nHA composite has a uniform and ultrafine microstructure with an average grain size of 70–90 nm in length and 5–25 nm in diameter, with no glassy or amorphous interface along the grain boundaries. It was deduced that the three phases formed strong bonding in the catalyst. Moreover, the nanosized catalysts were more competent than larger particles to serve as metal vehicles due to their enhanced affinity to metal components. The EDX results of the NiW–nHA composite catalyst revealed that the atomic percent of Ni and W elements were 3.75 and 1.96 (Fig. 3), respectively, while their maximum theoretical loading percentages were 5.12 and 2.97, respectively. Thus, it could be calculated that the loading ratio of Ni and W elements were 73.24% and 65.99%, respectively. These rates of metal loading were much higher than that of ref. 16. In addition, these nano-catalysts were capable of quickly responding to the surrounding environment. Thus, the synthesized NiW–nHA catalyst overcame the drawbacks, which would strongly affect the catalytic performance.

XRD measurement

Fig. 4 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the NiW–nHA catalyst. The characteristic peaks of nHA can be seen at 2θ = 25.94°, 31.93°, 40.13°, 47.01°and 48.72°, respectively. The XRD peaks of the NiW–nHA composite showed a significant decrease after incorporation of the two metals. This was attributed to co-precipitation with a large amount of metal loading within this composite. The active component was incorporated into the lattice of nHA by metal ion exchange. Ni2+ was firstly adsorbed by nHA. It then entered into the nHA crystal, which resulted in the changes of intensity and lattice parameters. In addition, the phosphorous (P) of nHA affected the structures of metals during the synthesis method. These metal ions were incorporated in the phosphate framework, which results remarkable catalytic activity and stability. From Fig. 4c, the CaWO4 phase appeared at 28.79° (2θ), which suggested that CaWO4 formed on the HA–Ni surface. It could weaken and decrease the interaction between Ni and W. It would also increase performance of the catalyst. In addition, the ions entered into nHA, which caused some changes in the a-axis and c-axis dimensions in the NiW–nHA composite.

Catalyst assay

FT-IR analysis. 

Fig. 5 displayed the FT-IR spectra of the hydrocracking of Jatropha oil over NiW–nHA composite. The major bands of Jatropha oil associated with CO (1735 cm−1) and C–O (1350–1150 cm−1) can be seen in Fig. 5a. When the temperature increased, these bands decreased sharply, which implies that the NiW–nHA catalyst broke down the ester bonding of Jatropha oil. In general, temperature was the main parameter for hydrocracking of vegetable oil. Thus, the reaction temperature significantly affected the composition of product. A higher temperature favored cracking according to FT-IR results. In addition, the bands at 2600–3000 cm−1 was associated to the saturated C–H stretching vibration (–CH3 and –CH2). Over the NiW–nHA composite, the products obtained at 400 °C were saturated alkanes.

GC analysis. 

Fig. 6 shows the GC charts of liquid products from the hydrocracking of Jatropha oil over NiW–nHA catalysts. When the temperature was 360 °C, a 91.88% conversion of Jatropha oil was achieved by this catalyst. The main products were n-C18H38, n-C17H36, n-C16H34, and n-C15H32. n-C17H36 was the main product, with a yield of 57.17 wt%. From this figure, it was also found that the yields of other products were n-C15H32 (12.52 wt%) > n-C16H38 (8.70 wt%) > n-C18H38 (5.17 wt%). So NiW–nHA composite catalyst demonstrated excellent results for hydrocracking without presulfurization. In addition, the yield of C15–C18 alkanes was 83.56 wt% in a fixed-bed reactor. With an increased reaction temperature, the amount of the light fraction (smaller than n-C15 alkanes) was enhanced, which is a result of further cracking (described in Table 1). The contribution of this catalyst toward the total variation observed was insignificant between the different temperatures. The higher temperature preferred cracking and producing much smaller hydrocarbon molecules. This was attributed to the fact that the hydrocracking of Jatropha oil was accelerated at higher temperature over NiW–nHA catalyst.

Sustainable production of biofuel is an important scientific challenge for the environmental problems resulting from the extensive use of fossil fuels.50–52 Hence, more and more scientists have attempted to develop a novel biofuel with (i) greater greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction in the complete life cycle in comparison with current biofuels53 and (ii) non-food biomass raw materials.54 A large number of cheap and environment-friendly vegetable oils could be developed for “green biofuel”.53 In particular, Jatropha oil, it is a candidate source. Refined Jatropha oil requires the removal of oxygen to obtain hydrocarbons by hydrotreatment.
The result of catalyst assay revealed that the complete conversion of triglycerides from Jatropha oil can be achieved over NiW–nHA catalysts at 400 °C. During the hydrocracking of Jatropha oil, initially, the CC bonds of triglycerides were hydrogenated over the metal phases. This reaction at a low temperature (180–250 °C) formed solid waxes without liquid products by hydrogenation, which was the first step. Then, the deoxygenation of triglycerides occurred on the metal phases as the second step. nHA also played an important role in this stage. As we know, P was classified as a secondary promoter in NiMoW-based catalysts.55,56 The P affected on the Brønsted acidity of the carrier without presulfurization. Impregnation of phosphorous prior to the metal phases led to the most active catalysts for hydrotreatment. Meanwhile, P maintained the high surface area of catalyst during the reaction.57 Thus optimum loadings of P improved the longevity of the catalyst. In the NiW–nHA catalyst, P of nHA could be effective in enhancing the selectivity of the catalysts, which resulted in excellent hydrocracking. According to GC and FT-IR data, all of the oxygen atoms in triglycerides were removed to form H2O, CO, and CO2 by reduction, decarbonylation, and decarboxylation (seen in Scheme 1). The liquid products were n-C18H38, n-C17H36, n-C16H34 and n-C15H32. These products possessed high melting points, which was responsible for the high pour point of the product from the NiW–nHA composite. In addition, there was no need for pretreatments and there were no side reactions. The pretreatments and no side reactions could decrease the efficiency of biofuel. When they were eliminated, the efficiency would increase sharply.
 Scheme 1  Steps in hydrotreating triglycerides in Jatropha oil by NiW–nHA composite. 
In the NiW–nHA composite system, nHA provided not only a carrier, but also active sites. And the P of nHA could avoid aggregation of activities and improve the efficiency of hydrotreatment. Of course, excessive P content may deteriorate the performance of this multi-phase catalyst. Therefore, further research should focus on the balance of weight ratio between nHA and metal activities.

Conclusions
A co-precipitation method was used to prepare a nanometer-sized NiW–nHA catalyst. Ni ions entered the n-HA crystal lattice and a new phase of CaWO4 was formed. The Ni/W-loadings were 73.24% and 65.99% in this system, respectively. In addition, the NiW–nHA composite showed excellent efficiency of catalyst. A yield of 83.56 wt% and a conversion of 91.88 wt% were achieved at 360 °C over this catalyst. As temperature increased, it achieved a 100% conversion rate. The reaction pathway involved hydrogenation of the CC bonds of these triglycerides from Jatropha oil. In all, this approach as used in the current study produced a composite with excellent hydrocracking properties. Therefore, the resulting nHA-based multi-metal system held great potential for a catalyst.
