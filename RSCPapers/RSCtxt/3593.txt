    , Accepted 20th April 2023First published on 25th April 2023AbstractExtending light absorption from visible to near-infrared (NIR) light regions and plasmon-induced hot electrons produced from the decay of surface plasmons of metallic nanoparticles are of significance in the photocatalytic field. Thus, the integration of plasmonic metallic nanoparticles with semiconductors for plasmon-enhanced visible and NIR light-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution from water splitting has attracted broad interest. Herein, we report a g-C3N4/TiN (named CN/TiN) plasmonic nanocomposite photocatalyst constructed from graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and metallic plasmonic titanium nitride nanoparticles (TiN NPs). TiN NPs act as both light absorption antenna and hot electron donors for g-C3N4 to enhance photocatalytic H2 evolution from water splitting under visible and NIR light regions. The transfer of hot electrons from metallic TiN to g-C3N4 leads to efficient charge transport and separation of photoexcited charges. The results reveal that photocatalytic activity is boosted by metallic plasmonic TiN in CN/TiN-x nanoheterostructures under visible-light (λ ≥ 420 nm) and NIR light (λ ≥ 700 nm) illumination. The maximum H2 evolution rate of 1308.80 μmol h−1 g−1 is observed with a corresponding apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 6.50% at λ ≥ 420 nm for the optimal CN/TiN-2 sample, which is 5-fold higher than that of g-C3N4 (258.0 μmol h−1 g−1). This improved photocatalytic performance is attributed to the efficient charge transport and separation, enhanced light-absorption, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of metallic TiN NPs. Remarkably, the CN/TiN-2 nanocomposite under NIR light illumination exhibits a H2 evolution rate of 169.20 μmol h−1 g−1, however, no H2 evolution is detected over pristine g-C3N4 at λ ≥ 700 nm. This study provides a new concept to construct metallic plasmon-based photocatalysts for the wide-spectrum utilization of solar light in practical applications.
Introduction
The energy demand has been rapidly increasing as technology has progressed. In particular, the transportation necessities of energy have reached an exceptionally high level. The use of H2 gas as daily-life energy has been suggested for years in applications such as fuel-cell vehicles, however, it is still under exploration and consideration. The concepts have faced giant complexities such as H2 storage systems, low conversion rates, and relatively high cost for bulk generation.1,2 Several initiatives have been launched to enhance H2 generation. Previously, H2 was produced by fossil fuel splitting, which caused air pollution.3 To solve this severe problem, the water splitting method was proposed, which converts water into H2 through several routes such as thermolysis, electrocatalysis, and photolysis.4 Amongst these methods, photocatalytic water splitting is considered as an effective strategy using photocatalysts.5,6 The fundamental photocatalytic water splitting mechanism involves the absorption of photons from the light surface to produce e−/h+ pairs, the transport and separation of photoinduced charge carriers, the collapse of the majority of the photogenerated carriers within bulk photocatalysts, and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers to cocatalysts for surface redox reactions. Low quantum yields and extremely poor photocatalytic activity result in only a small fraction of photogenerated carriers being able to finally participate in redox processes.7 Photocatalytic water splitting is extremely challenging due to its undesirable thermodynamics, slow kinetics, dissolved oxygen, reverse reaction, and secondary reaction. To attain high efficiency in photocatalytic water splitting, these limitations must be overcome.8–10 TiO2 was first explored for photoelectrochemical water splitting under solar-light illumination in 1972.11 Generally, the performance and durability of wide bandgap photocatalysts (ZnO and TiO2) were high, however, solar radiation has not been proficiently absorbed for stimulating free electrons in water. For such reason, these materials are restricted to be used as efficient photocatalysts to enhance H2 evolution from water splitting using sunlight.12,13
In recent decades, semiconductor-based photocatalysts are emerging alternatives that can contribute to solving the world's energy shortfalls through efficient water splitting to generate sustainable H2 energy.14,15 Previously, researchers have explored new efficient semiconductor-based photocatalysts.16,17 Among these, g-C3N4 received much attention due to its appropriate band configuration, outstanding chemical stability, and relatively low cost.18,19 Nevertheless, the photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4 photocatalyst is still low due to its poor light absorption capability and quick recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, and therefore, much effort has been made to tackle these issues.20,21
The development of plasmonic heterostructures is a promising strategy to solve the above-mentioned limitations because it can synergistically broaden the light absorption scope of photocatalysts and inhibit charge carrier recombination.22,23 Peng et al.24 reported that the specific SPR effect of plasmonic systems broadened the light absorption capabilities in the visible and NIR regions. Furthermore, hot electrons produced from plasmonic metals can be inherited as supplementary electron-donors in the photocatalytic process to enhance performance. Over the last decade, the field of plasmonic photocatalysts has made significant progress using noble metals Au and Ag as plasmonic nanoantennas.25,26 In traditional metal–semiconductor heterostructures, like Au-TiO2, plasmon-induced hot electrons migrate from the Au noble metal to TiO2 through a Schottky barrier.27 As an alternative strategy for replacing Au and Ag-based noble metal plasmonic systems, it is necessary to explore cheap metallic plasmonic materials that extend light absorption and enhance charge separation and transport.
Recently, transition metal nitrides,28,29 such as WN, HfN, ZrN, and TiN, have received attention as favourable replacements of Ag and Au-based noble metal plasmonic systems. Transition metal nitrides have high conductivity, and display plasmonic characteristics both in visible and NIR areas.30–33 These plasmonic materials can replace typical noble metals (Ag and Au) in several plasmonic systems because of their excellent stability and low cost.34 Among transition metal nitrides, TiN has been utilized in various applications including nonlinear optics,35 local heating sources,36 self-powered plasmonic photodetectors,37 and hyperbolic metamaterials.38 To the best of our knowledge, there is no report of TiN as a plasmonic metal for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Hence, it is of importance to couple plasmonic metallic TiN with a semiconductor for improving photocatalytic H2 evolution.
In this study, we design and fabricate a series of plasmonic CN/TiN-x nanocomposites for enhanced visible and NIR light-driven photocatalytic H2 production from water splitting. The obtained CN/TiN heterostructured photocatalysts display enhanced photocatalytic activity based on the plasmon-induced hot-electron transfer (PHET) mechanism. The optimal CN/TiN-2 nanocomposite photocatalyst shows 1308.80 μmol h−1 g−1 and 169.20 μmol h−1 g−1 H2 evolution rates in visible and NIR light regions, respectively. Metallic TiN NPs not only expand light absorption but also provide additional hot electrons in a wide range of light illumination to g-C3N4 nanosheets. We believe that this study will open the door to developing other plasmonic metal/semiconductor nanocomposite photocatalysts with high performance.
Experimental
Fabrication of g-C3N4 nanosheets
In a conventional route, 18 g of urea was kept in an alumina pot and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h in an air environment, with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. Afterwards, cooling down to ambient temperature, the attained light-yellow material was marked as g-C3N4.
Synthesis of TiN nanoparticles
0.4 g of TiO2 (P25, Degussa) was taken in a ceramic boat and calcined in an NH3 atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h. After cooling down to ambient temperature, the obtained material was washed with water and low centrifuged to remove large aggregates. Finally, the black sample was marked as TiN.
Synthesis of CN/TiN-x nanocomposites
A certain amount of g-C3N4 and varying amounts (1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% by weight) of TiN were dispersed in 40 mL of ethanol. Consequently, the mixed solution was heated in a water bath at 80 °C under stirring to remove the solvent. The subsequent dry solids were lodged in a ceramic boat with a cover and calcined at 400 °C for 2 h at a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 under N2 flow. Eventually, after cooling down to room temperature, the obtained material was marked as CN/TiN-x.
Results and discussion
The typical synthesis routes of g-C3N4 nanosheets, TiN NPs, and CN/TiN-x (x represents the weight content of TiN) photocatalysts are shown in Fig. S1† (see the Experimental section). Fig. 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of g-C3N4, TiN, and CN/TiN-x samples. For pristine g-C3N4, two typical diffraction peaks are observed at 13.0° and 27.5°, corresponding to the in-plane configurational packing of tri-s-triazine units (100) and internal-layer stacking of carbon nitride (002), respectively.39 From XRD patterns of CN/TiN-x photocatalysts, all the distinctive peaks of g-C3N4 are found. In addition, one weak diffraction peak is observed at 43.1°, which is attributed to the (200) crystal face of TiN. This result demonstrates that TiN was successfully anchored onto g-C3N4. FTIR spectroscopy was used to investigate the chemical structures of the as-synthesized samples (Fig. 1b). For bare g-C3N4, the band at 804 cm−1 is ascribed to the breathing of tri-s-triazine cycles.40 Meanwhile, the broad absorption bands at around 1243–1634 cm−1 are attributed to the C–N and CN aromatic rings.41 The bands centered at around 3100–3600 cm−1 are ascribed to the extending vibration of C–NH2 and C–N–H bonds that occur as an uncondensed amino group on the g-C3N4 surface.42 From the FTIR spectrum of pure metallic TiN nanoparticles, it is found that the band around 700 cm−1 is ascribed to the Ti–N absorption band (Fig. S2†).43 It can be clearly seen that the FTIR spectra of the as-made CN/TiN-x samples show all the characteristic bands of g-C3N4. This result indicates that the loading of metallic TiN has little effect on the composition and crystal structure of g-C3N4.44 Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) measurements showed that the g-C3N4 and TiN contents of the optimal CN/TiN-2 sample were about 97.397% and 2.603%, respectively (Table S1†). The optical characteristics of the obtained photocatalysts were investigated by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Compared to g-C3N4, CN/TiN-x photocatalysts reveal enhanced optical absorption and wide absorption in the visible and NIR light range with an increase in the amount of metallic TiN NPs (Fig. 1c). This result confirms the successful incorporation of metallic TiN NPs onto g-C3N4 surfaces, which efficiently extended the light absorption. The UV-DRS absorption spectra of metallic TiN is shown in Fig. S3.† Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests were performed to evaluate the contribution of metallic TiN NPs to the effective generation of charge transfer and the essential electronic features of g-C3N4. As displayed in Fig. 1d, both g-C3N4 and CN/TiN-2 photocatalysts show an isotropic signal (at a g value of 2.003), which is attributed to a single electron in the conduction band of carbon nitride.45 The intensity of the CN/TiN-2 nanocomposite is increased compared to that of g-C3N4, thus indicating the higher concentration of delocalized electrons and improved charge transport.46 It is concluded that the addition of an optimum amount of metallic TiN can assist the formation of delocalized electrons and charge radicals on g-C3N4 as well as improve the electronic properties for efficient charge carrier transport.

The morphologies of g-C3N4, TiN, and CN/TiN-2 samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SEM images clearly show that all samples display a typical nanosheet-like structure (Fig. S4a–c†). The TEM images confirm that pristine g-C3N4 nanosheets exhibit a conventional nanosheet-like structure, as seen in Fig. 2a. Metallic TiN presents a nanosheet-like structure (Fig. 2b). As depicted in Fig. 2c, after the addition of TiN into g-C3N4 nanosheets, the obtained CN/TiN-2 nanocomposite reveals an analogous sheet-like structure with a reduced size. Moreover, the presence of TiN NPs on g-C3N4 was further identified by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF–STEM) with its equivalent EDS elemental mapping. In Fig. 2d, clear lattice fringes are detected with an interplanar spacing of 0.20 nm. As displayed in Fig. 2e, the elemental mapping images confirm the existence of Ti, C, and N elements in the CN/TiN-2 nanocomposite, and this result suggests that TiN NPs are successfully introduced onto g-C3N4.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to explore the chemical compositions of the CN/TiN-2 photocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 3a, the XPS survey spectrum proves the presence of C, N, and Ti elements in CN/TiN-2, while no Ti element is observed in pure g-C3N4. The C 1s spectrum could be divided into three peaks, 284.7, 285.3, and 288.3 eV, respectively (Fig. 3b). The peak at 284.7 eV is attributed to sp2-hybridized carbon contamination, for example, grease or CC. While, the peaks at 285.3 and 288.3 eV are associated with the C–NH2 in the core level of g-C3N4 and sp2-hybridized carbon atoms (N–CN), respectively.5 As depicted in Fig. 3c, the N 1s spectrum contains four broad peaks located at 398.8, 400.1, 401.2, and 404.3 eV, which are attributed to the sp2 localized N (C–NC), graphite N (C3–N), and amino functional groups (C–NH/C–NH2), respectively.47,48 One small peak that appeared at 397.4 eV is ascribed to TiN49Fig. 3d shows the Ti 2p spectrum of the CN/TiN-2 sample. The broad peak at 457.9 eV is associated with Ti 2p3/2 and the peak at 463.9 eV is related to Ti 2p1/2.50 However, the intensity of the Ti 2p peak is too low, the possible reason for this is mainly the small content of TiN in CN/TiN-2. Additionally, Fig. S5† displays the Ti 2p spectrum of the CN/TiN-4 sample, which shows broad peaks of Ti 2p, further indicating that TiN is bonded to g-C3N4.

Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were conducted to assess the efficacy of photoinduced e−/h+ pairs. The PL spectra of the g-C3N4 and CN/TiN-2 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 4a. It is noted that the intensity of CN/TiN-2 heterojunction is weaker than that of g-C3N4, suggesting that metallic TiN is helpful for retarding electron–hole pair recombination. Furthermore, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded to measure the lifetime of photoinduced charge carriers. As depicted in Fig. 4b, the typically excited state lifetimes of g-C3N4 and CN/TiN-2 are 2.26 ± 0.39 and 1.40 ± 0.28 ns, respectively. This reduction in lifetime implies the fast transport and separation efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers.51,52 This result indicates that TiN anchored onto g-C3N4 is helpful for reducing charge carrier lifetimes, which in turn improves charge migration and separation. In addition, the charge carrier properties of g-C3N4 and CN/TiN-2 samples were investigated using a photoelectrocurrent test in a conventional three-electrode cell with several on/off visible-light illumination periods. As illustrated in Fig. 4c, the transient photocurrent response (TPR) of the CN/TiN-2 heterostructure is much higher than that of g-C3N4. This result demonstrates that in the presence of TiN NPs, the separation and migration of photoinduced e−/h+ pairs are significantly improved.53 Additionally, the interfacial charge-transport resistance of g-C3N4 and CN/TiN-2 was measured using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plot (Fig. 4d). It is clearly found that CN/TiN-2 has a relatively small angle radius in the EIS Nyquist plot compared to g-C3N4, further emphasizing that the addition of TiN NPs can reduce the charge transfer resistance while increasing the electronic conductivity. Taken together, the TPR and EIS results prove that metallic plasmonic TiN introduction into g-C3N4 can stimulate photoinduced e−/h+ pairs and boost photocatalytic H2 production of g-C3N4 over the composite photocatalyst.

In our photocatalytic experiments, triethanolamine (TEAO) was selected as a sacrificial agent because it is the most efficient compared to as-tested sacrificial reagents in terms of the H2 evolution rate over the optimal CN/TiN-2 (the weight content of TiN is 2 wt%) sample (see Fig. S6†). As shown in Fig. 5a, upon increasing the amount of TiN in CN/TiN-x nanocomposites (from 1 wt% to 4 wt%) the H2 evolution rates increased firstly and then decreased under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420). The highest H2 evolution rate of 1308.80 μmol h−1 g−1 was achieved over the CN/TiN-2 sample, which is 5 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4 (258.0 μmol h−1 g−1), and this H2 production rate is higher than those of previously reported g-C3N4-based heterojunctions (see Table S2†). It is noted that, when the amount of TiN in CN/TiN-x is further increased to 4%, the H2 evolution rate decreased to 521.37 μmol h−1 g−1. The possible reasons for this decrease in the H2 evolution rate could be that a higher content of TiN NPs may inhibit light absorption due to the shielding effect, block the active sites and form a recombination center for photogenerated e−/h+ pairs, thus reducing the activity of the CN/TiN-4 sample.54,55 From Fig. 5b, it is clearly found that TiN NPs and CN/TiN-x nanocomposites exhibited H2 evolution even under NIR light illumination (≥700 nm). The highest H2 evolution rate of 169.20 μmol h−1 g−1 is obtained for the optimal CN/TiN-2 heterostructure under NIR light illumination (λ ≥ 700 nm), while no H2 production is observed over pure g-C3N4, while bare TiN shows a negligible H2 generation rate (13.40 μmol h−1 g−1). The N2 adsorption–desorption experiments reveal that the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the CN/TiN-2 sample (84 m2 g−1) is slightly higher than that of pure g-C3N4 (74 m2 g−1) (Fig. S7a†), while the pore size distribution curves show that CN/TiN-2 retains more mesopores than g-C3N4 (Fig. S7b†). This result suggests that plasmon-induced hot electron transfer from TiN to g-C3N4 is attributed to the improvement of the photocatalytic activity of the CN/TiN-x plasmonic photocatalysts. Furthermore, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the CN/TiN-2 sample was measured at different monochromatic light-illumination wavelengths (λ = 420, 450, 500, 550, and 600 nm ± 5 nm). As shown in Fig. 5c, at a wavelength of 420 nm, a maximum quantum efficiency of 6.50% was achieved. It is found that the AQE tends to decrease upon increasing the value of λ, which is consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectrum of CN/TiN-2. The solar-to-hydrogen conversion (STH) efficiency of the CN/TiN-2 plasmonic heterojunction was investigated under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2, 1 cm2). Upon irradiation for 6 h, a total of 6.53 μmol H2 was obtained and the STH of the CN/TiN-2 sample was found to be 0.07% (Fig. S8†).56,57 Taken together, our findings are the first demonstration that anchoring metallic TiN as a plasmonic material onto g-C3N4 dramatically enhances photocatalytic H2 evolution. The photocatalytic stability is a key factor for evaluating the performance of catalysts for potential practical applications. The recycling experiments were carried out to test the stability of the CN/TiN-2 sample. Even after 5 consecutive cycles under the same conditions, no obvious downward trend is observed for hydrogen production, as shown in Fig. 5d. In addition, it can also be observed that the H2 evolution rate is slightly increased upon increasing the number of cycles because the H2 evolution reaction is an activation process and the light absorption on the photocatalyst surface increases with an increase of the irradiation time.58 Furthermore, after the stability test, the sample was recovered to examine its structure, and no notable change was found from the XRD pattern of the used CN/TiN-2 sample compared to the fresh sample (Fig. S9†). This result indicates that the CN/TiN-2 photocatalyst is excellently stable for long-term photocatalytic H2 generation.

Based on energy band alignments of metallic plasmonic TiN and g-C3N4, a plasmon-induced hot electron transfer (PHET) mechanism is proposed, which is ascribed to improved photocatalytic H2 evolution over g-C3N4/TiN photocatalysts (Fig. 6). As presented in Fig. S10,† the estimated band gap of g-C3N4 is 2.65 eV. According to previous studies on g-C3N4, the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) potentials are placed at −3.4 and −6.1 eV vs. the absolute vacuum scale, respectively.59,60 While no band gap is detected for plasmonic TiN, which further indicates its metallic feature. The Fermi level of metallic TiN is located at −4.45 eV.61 The metallic TiN is promoted to excited states under light illumination, due to its strong surface plasmon resonance absorption via electronic interband transitions. The photoexcited TiN produces hot electrons, and then moves above the Fermi level of metallic TiN. The plasmon decays into a hot e−/h+ pair within the metal through Landua damping, which is followed by the transfer of hot electrons from metallic nanoparticles into adjacent semiconductors.62–64 It is well documented that an electric field is built when a metallic plasmonic material comes into contact with the semiconductor.65 Finally, these plasmon-induced hot electrons transfer from the plasmonic TiN to the CB of g-C3N4 and further migrate to Pt active centers for the reductive product (H+ into H2). To maintain charge equilibrium, the photoinduced holes remaining in the VB of g-C3N4 are depleted by the sacrificial agent (TEOA) to produce an oxidative product (TEOA+). CN/TiN plasmonic photocatalysts have a high redox potential to produce efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution from water splitting via an effective PHET pathway. Thus, photogenerated plasmon hot electron migration from metallic TiN to g-C3N4 and the TiN bond at the interface in CN/TiN nanocomposites are readily favourable for improving the photocatalytic activity.

Conclusions
In the present work, we have successfully developed plasmonic CN/TiN-x photocatalysts by integration of metallic TiN nanoparticles with g-C3N4 for enhanced photocatalytic H2 generation from water splitting under visible and NIR light illumination. From experimental results, it is found that the plasmonic metallic TiN play a vital role in boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution. Under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420), the maximum H2 evolution rate of 1308.80 μmol h−1 g−1 is obtained with an AQE of 6.50% at 420 nm over the optimal CN/TiN-2 plasmonic catalyst. On the other hand, a H2 evolution rate of 169.20 μmol h−1 g−1 is obtained over CN/TiN-2 under NIR light illumination (λ ≥ 700). The PL, TRPL, TPR, and EIS analyses of the CN/TiN-2 sample shows higher charge transport and separation efficiency in comparison with bare g-C3N4. Besides, the CN/TiN-2 nanocomposite photocatalyst reveals outstanding recycling stability after 20 h of 5 continuous photocatalytic cycles. This excellent photocatalytic activity is attributed to the SPR effect of metallic TiN that produces hot electrons and transports them to g-C3N4 nanosheets to assist the water reduction reaction. This study offers a new approach to creating other efficient plasmonic metal/semiconductor heterostructures with broad light absorption for solar-to-fuel conversion.
