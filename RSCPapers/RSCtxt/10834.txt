    , Accepted 25th April 2021First published on 26th April 2021AbstractThe simultaneous improvement of photovoltaic performance and stability is crucial for further commercial development of MAPbI3 perovskites. Here we report a dual-ion exchange and alloying method using DMACl (dimethylammonium chloride) to improve the stability and charge transport ability. The synergetic effect of the DMA cation and Cl anion induces the re-growth of perovskite crystals and forms cubic phase MA1−xDMAxPbI3. As a result, the efficiency and stability of DMACl-based MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells are significantly improved. Such dual-function of DMA cation doping and the Cl anion additive provides an effective strategy for the control of MAPbI3 perovskite crystallization.
Photovoltaics is one of the most important technologies to harness clean and renewable solar energy. Organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have witnessed remarkable progress in the past decade with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) improved from an initial 3.8% to a certified current value of 25.5%.1–6 Nevertheless, the long-term retainment of efficiency and stability is the main obstacle for commercialization of MAPbI3 perovskites due to the volatility and hygroscopicity of the MA cation.7–10 Additive engineering is a common method used to improve the efficiency and stability of MAPbI3-based PSCs. Various organic and inorganic chlorides such as MACl (methylammonium chloride), PbCl2 (lead chloride), NH4Cl (ammonium chloride) and methylammonium salts such as MAI (methylammonium iodide), MAAc (methylammonium acetate), and MAF (methylammonium formate) have been added into MAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution to assist perovskite growth with enhanced crystalline properties and surface morphology.11–17 In most cases, the additive would leave the system after film annealing without changing the composition or structure of the perovskite. Although the performance and stability of MAPbI3-based PSCs could be greatly improved by improving the film quality by the abovementioned methods, the intrinsic instability of the MAPbI3 structure still remains a challenge.
In this work, we introduce DMACl as an additive into the MAPbI3 perovskite to manipulate the stability and charge transport ability. The crystallization process of the DMACl/MAPbI3 perovskite is identified as a dual-ion exchange process. The synergetic effect of DMA cation doping during the MAPbI3 crystal growth process, and the halide exchange between Cl and I promote grain boundary growth and enhance film crystallinity. This process significantly reduces the trap density of the perovskite, leading to higher carrier mobilities and more efficient charge separation and transfer. DMA cation incorporation also induces the transition of the perovskite crystal structure from the tetragonal phase of MAPbI3 to a more stable cubic phase of MA1−xDMAxPbI3. In general, the DMACl additive effectively improves the stability and optoelectronic properties of MAPbI3-based PSCs.
We first compared the effect of MACl and DMACl on the quality of final perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD patterns of the control MAPbI3 sample using the MACl additive exhibit two characteristic (110) and (220) peaks at ∼14.10° and ∼28.44°, respectively. For DMACl, the peak intensity was greatly enhanced, indicating improved crystallinity. Moreover, these two peaks in DMACl samples shift to ∼14.04° and ∼28.28°, respectively, suggesting the expansion of the crystal axis length and the cell volume. All the results indicate that the DMACl additive not only improves the film crystallinity, but also affects the crystal structure. This phenomenon might be related to the doping of the larger sized DMA cation into MAPbI3. No impurities such as PbI2 related peaks are found in both samples. The UV-vis spectra in Fig. 1b show that the DMA cation doping induces the absorption onset of DMACl/MAPbI3 to slightly blue-shift from 778 nm to 776 nm, which can be attributed to the alloying with the large size DMA cation. The blue shift can also be observed in the PL spectra in Fig. S1.† As shown in Fig. 1c and d, the time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) imaging result of DMACl/MAPbI3 reveals that the DMA cation distributes uniformly in the perovskite films after annealing at 100 °C for 20 min, while there is no Cl residue found in the films, confirmed by the absence of Cl peaks in the range of 195–205 eV on XPS spectra (Fig. S2†).

Bottom left inset of each image: cross-sectional SEM images of the fabricated MACl/MAPbI3 and DMACl/MAPbI3 device. 
The top-view SEM images in Fig. 1e and f show that DMACl/MAPbI3 films present a large perovskite crystal with grain size up to 1.5 μm, while the average diameter of grains in the control sample is just about 500 nm. AFM images in Fig. S3† also reveal that the grain size of DMACl/MAPbI3 films is much larger than that of the control. The larger grain size is expected to be very beneficial for reducing trap density and efficient carrier transport and extraction.18 Comparison between the cross-sectional SEM images of the devices fabricated with the two kinds of perovskites also proves that the MAPbI3 perovskite with the DMACl additive grows more compactly on the substrate (Fig. 1f inset) while lots of pinholes are found in the control (Fig. 1e inset).
The effect of the DMACl additive on improving both the moisture and thermal stability of perovskite films was also examined. As shown in the comparison of XRD patterns in Fig. 2a and b, after being exposed to 70% relative humidity (RH) at room temperature up to 9 days, the MACl/MAPbI3 films are severely degraded with high intensity of the PbI2 peak, while the DMACl/MAPbI3 films maintain crystalline characteristics with minor occurrence of PbI2. As shown in Fig. S4,† the MACl/MAPbI3 films exhibit a dramatic decrease in the absorption intensity after 9 days of exposure, while DMACl/MAPbI3 films maintain initial absorbance with negligible changes. As for the thermal stability test, after annealing at 70 °C for 14 days, a much stronger PbI2 peak can be observed in the control MACl/MAPbI3 sample than in the DMACl/MAPbI3 sample revealed by the XRD results shown in Fig. 2c and d. The UV-vis spectra in Fig. S5† also show that the DMACl/MAPbI3 sample has much enhanced thermal stability compared to the control. Such enhancements could be attributed to the synergetic effect of film quality improvement and the crystal structure regulation realized by the DMACl additive. The DMACl/MAPbI3 sample shows much higher crystallinity and larger grain sizes, showing better resistance performance against moisture and heat. Furthermore, the DMA doping could greatly reduce the degree of the octahedral tilting of the PbI64− framework. As shown in the crystal structure comparison in Fig. 2e, the distortion of Pb–I is greatly reduced from the MACl/MAPbI3 (tetragonal) to DMACl/MAPbI3 (cubic), leading to the formation of a more compact and rigid lattice structure by PbI64− octahedra. The cations in the cubic DMACl/MAPbI3 structure are filled up closer to the ideal volume limit, and thus the loss of MA caused by moisture or heat is greatly prohibited, resulting in a perovskite film with better intrinsic stability.19 Furthermore, the amount of the DMACl additive can greatly affect the film quality and device performance. As shown in Fig. S6,† the peak intensity and band gap of perovskite films increase with the added amount of DMACl.20,21 The performance of MAPbI3 PSCs with different amounts of the DMACl additive is examined (shown in Fig. S7†). The optimized DMACl additive composition is 0.15 (molar ratio of DMACl/PbI2), and this ratio is used for subsequent studies.

(c) and (d) XRD patterns of MACl/MAPbI3 and DMACl/MAPbI3 films before and after annealing at 70 °C for 14 days. (e) Crystal structures of MACl/MAPbI3 in the tetragonal phase, and DMACl/MAPbI3 in the cubic phase. 
The above results show that DMACl not only greatly improves the film quality and stability, but also enhances the crystal structure rigidity of the MAPbI3 perovskite. Considering that DMACl is less volatile than MACl, a dual cation/anion exchange may take place between DMACl and MAI.
DMACl can act as a DMA source and a certain amount of the DMA cation can replace the position of the MA cation to form a mixed cation perovskite. To further explore the effect of the Cl ion and DMA cation, we prepared a control sample using the same molar ratio of DMAI to compare their XRD profiles and surface morphologies. As shown in Fig. S8,† the characteristic (110) peak of DMAI/MAPbI3 is found at ∼14.04°, which is the same as that observed for the DMACl/MAPbI3 sample, revealing that the DMA cation in DMACl may play the same role as DMAI. However, the much lower peak intensity of the DMAI/MAPbI3 sample in XRD results shows that the addition of DMAI deteriorates the crystallinity of the DMAI/MAPbI3 sample. Comparison between the SEM images of Fig. 1f and S9† shows that the average grain size of DMAI/MAPbI3 is also smaller than that of the DMACl/MAPbI3 sample. Taking together, it can be concluded that the synergetic effect of both the DMA cation and Cl anion results in the improvement of the crystallinity of the DMACl/MAPbI3 perovskite.
To investigate the mechanism of DMACl for the growth of the DMACl/MAPbI3 perovskite, the detailed crystallization process was investigated. The XRD patterns (Fig. 3a) show that, before film annealing, characteristic perovskite peaks located at ∼14.10° and ∼28.44° appear for the MACl sample, together with several peaks of intermediate phases formed with solvent molecules from the precursor solution. Then the perovskite peak intensity increases at prolonged annealing durations; no peak shift or new peaks are found. In contrast, in the DMACl sample (Fig. 3b), a strong peak at ∼11.7° can be found without annealing, which is assigned to DMAPbI3 (Fig. S10†).20,22,23 The MAPbI3 perovskite peaks are also found but with low intensity, indicating that the DMA cation will crystalize into the DMAPbI3 phase before annealing. Upon heating, the intensity of DMAPbI3 decreases and vanishes after 1 min annealing. Meanwhile, the MAPbI3 perovskite peak at ∼14.1° increases rapidly. A peak position shift from ∼14.10° to ∼14.04° is also observed before the DMAPbI3 peaks disappear (Fig. S11†), suggesting a possible gradient componential exchange, which is also confirmed by the blue-shift of the PL peak (Fig. S12†). In addition, the morphological evolutions shown in Fig. 3c and d reveal that the DMACl system may have a much different crystal growth pathway compared with MACl. For the control sample, the grain size of the MACl/MAPbI3 crystal does not significantly change after annealing for 10 s, except that the grain boundaries become sharper and clearer. In contrast, SEM images in Fig. 3d show that the grain size of the DMACl system gradually decreases during the first 30 s and then keeps increasing during annealing. The initial decrease of particle size can be related to the gradual transformation of the crystal structure from the DMAPbI3 phase to the MA1−xDMAxPbI3 phase. The subsequent growth of particles is due to the gradual substitution of the MA cation by the DMA cation, and the eventual evaporation of the MA cation and excess Cl ion. Taking the above results into consideration, we come to the following hypothesis about the possible crystallization process as shown in Fig. 3e.

In the DMACl/MAPbI3 composition, the Cl ion in DMACl will exchange with the I ion to form DMAPbI3 and then the DMA cation exchanges with the MA cation to form the MA1−xDMAxPbI3 perovskite. The whole process is described as:xDMACl + MAI + PbI2 → xDMAPbI3 + MAPb1−xI3(1−x)Clx → xDMAPbI3 + (1 − x)MAPbI3·xMACl → MA1−xDMAxPbI3 + xMACl
During the first step, the crystal of DMAPbI3 forms before annealing. Upon annealing, the dual-ion exchange process takes place. The MAPbI3 crystal grows and the DMA cation in the initial DMAPbI3 crystal replaces the MA cation in MAPbI3 crystal gradually while the exchange of between the I ion and Cl ion occur simultaneously. The DMAPbI3 may act as a seed for the subsequent formation of the MA1−xDMAxPbI3 perovskite via ion exchange. The dual-ion exchange process is very important as the synergetic effect of DMA–MA exchange and MACl release promotes grain boundary regrowth and tunes the lattice parameter, leading to s larger grain size, much enhanced crystallinity and stable cubic phase perovskite as evidenced by the morphologies and XRD pattern evolution (Fig. 3). The by-product MACl might evaporate as MACl gas (or other volatile organic chlorides like CH3Cl and NH3), thus slowing down the growth process of the DMACl/MAPbI3 crystal, and eventually forms a more stable cubic MA1−xDMAxPbI3 perovskite.
The impact of DMACl on the carrier transfer properties of the perovskite films was further explored. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results are shown in Fig. 4a. The DMACl sample shows a much increased average carrier lifetime (131.78 ns) than MACl/MAPbI3 (89.51 ns), indicating that the defect-caused non-radiative combination is greatly suppressed, which is consistent with the stronger PL intensity of the DMACl sample in steady state photoluminescence spectra (Fig. S13†). Fig. 4b and c show the transient photocurrent and transient photovoltage of DMACl/MAPbI3 and the control sample. The faster decline of the transient photocurrent of the DMACl sample indicates that the internal carrier transport is more efficient. The slower decrease of the transient photovoltage indicates that the DMACl/MAPbI3-based perovskite film has fewer defects inside, which is consistent with the previous conclusion that crystal re-growth causes more efficient charge separation and transfer.

Perovskite solar cell devices were fabricated using the FTO/TiO2–SnO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag planar architecture. The average efficiency of DMACl/MAPbI3 based MAPbI3 PSCs is improved from ∼17.26% to ∼19.96% with a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) as summarized in Table S1.† Such enhancement should have originated from the larger grain size and stronger crystallinity which reduce the carrier recombination and promote the charge transfer efficiency supported by EIS analysis and dark J–V curves shown in Fig. S14 and S15.†24,25 The DMACl/MAPbI3 based devices show much higher carrier recombination resistance and a lower leakage current.
A champion DMACl/MAPbI3 device reaches a PCE of 20.70% with a JSC of 23.29 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.089 V and a FF of 0.816 (Fig. 4d), which is well consistent with the integrated value (22.80 mA cm−2) from the EQE curve shown in Fig. 4e. Typical J–V hysteresis curves of DMACl/MAPbI3 devices (Fig. S16†) reveal that the DMACl/MAPbI3 devices have negligible hysteresis. A stable output efficiency of 20.02% for more than 1000 s can be obtained as shown in Fig. S17.† The DMACl/MAPbI3 device also exhibits improved stability compared to the control sample. The PCE of the control sample degrades to approximately 40% of the initial PCE, whereas the DMACl/MAPbI3 device maintains approximately 90% of its initial PCE under continuous LED light illumination over 600 h (Fig. S18†).
In summary, we demonstrate that DMACl is a promising dual function additive for the development of stable and efficient MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells. The DMACl additive can take advantage of the synergetic effects of both DMA cation doping and Cl anion additives, thereby inducing the re-growth of the perovskite crystal and reduction of the defect density of the MA1−xDMAxPbI3 perovskite. Consequently, the thermal and moisture stability, as well as the PV performance of the MAPbI3 perovskite is greatly improved. Our work highlights the importance of the synergetic effect of the A-site cation alloy and anion additive, providing a new methodology for the selection of additives for the development of stable and efficient PSCs.
