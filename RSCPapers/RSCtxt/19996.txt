E-mail: spad@iacs.res.inReceived 29th July 2013, Accepted 10th September 2013First published on 10th September 2013AbstractStructures and electronic properties of porphyrins with various Donor (D)–Acceptor (A) functionalization adsorbed on TiO2 (anatase) nanoparticles are studied using DFT calculations. Adsorption of porphyrin leads to a substantial loss of planarity (puckering) for the porphyrin rings due to the stabilization of the system by the interaction of the lone-pair of electrons of the N-atoms of porphyrin with the Ti-atoms of anatase. For free porphyrin, the mode of binding to anatase is from the top-site, while for the binding of D–A functionalized porphyrin, side-wise interactions are stabilized via anchoring groups on the A (–SO3H, –PO3H2 and –CO2H). Adsorption of porphyrin on TiO2 changes the relative ordering of HOMO and LUMO levels compared to that of the free molecule and bare TiO2 nanoparticles which critically effects their performance for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The relative energy differences between the LUMO of the free molecule and LUMO of molecule⋯TiO2 complex (ε2) and LUMO of molecule⋯TiO2 complex and CB (conduction band) of bare TiO2 (ε3) are proposed as two key parameters for determining the suitability of the material for functioning as a DSSC material. Coupling of the porphyrin ring with nanoparticles leads to the appearance of additional optically-active states due to dye → TiO2 charge-transfer (CT) transitions. This leads to a possibility for these dyes to act as type-II DSSC materials as well. We suggest that there exists no such general rule that only different sets of molecules are suitable for type-I and type-II DSSCs. Concentration dependent UV-Vis absorption spectra measurements can be a simple experimental test to detect a mechanistic switch-over between type-I and type-II DSSC processes in dyes.IntroductionOver the last few years there has been a growing consensus that sustainable development shall require harvesting energy from clean, safe and non-fossil sources.1,2 In this context, the prospect for solar energy harvesting using Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) has been on rise.3–5 Intense research is underway to understand the processes involved in the conversion of light to electricity.6 The technological aspects are focused on methods to fine-tune, optimize and enhance the efficiency of devices fabricated for DSSCs.7 The basic ingredients of a typical DSSC includes an organic dye which upon photo-excitation donates the electron to a semi-conductor surface which is connected to the external circuit thereby producing electricity.8 The process cycle is maintained via pumping of electrons from a redox couple like I3−/I− to the oxidized organic dye.Several molecules, like those based on Ru(II) polypyridyl dyes,9 metal porphyrin derivatives10 and metal free dyes like polyenes,11 coumarins,12 hemicyanins,13 polythiophene derivatives,14 squarine based systems15 and catechol,16 have exhibited high DSSC efficiency. The most widely studied DSSCs showing significant efficiencies are based on n-type semiconductor nanostructured surfaces/clusters like TiO2 and ZnO17 which act as anodes (accepting electrons in their conduction band (CB)). These n-type semiconductor DSSC materials are further classified into type-I and type-II depending on whether the excited electron moves from the LUMO of the dye to the CB of TiO2/ZnO (type-I) or there is a direct charge-transfer (CT) excitation of electron from the HOMO of the dye to the CB of TiO2/ZnO (type-II).18 A recent review on DSSCs by Ooyama and Harima discusses the various types of materials and their classifications comprehensively.19From the theoretical point of view, several works have focused on the fine-tuning of the structure of the dye and its HOMO–LUMO levels and the optical gap so that it can absorb solar energy efficiently.20–24 Only recently, there has been a progress towards an understanding of the processes involved in the photo-induced electron transfer from the dye to the semi-conductor nanoparticle.25,26 As the computational expense of the calculations increases rapidly with increases in the number of atoms, most of the calculations are restricted to organic chromophores as models for organic dyes and a few atom (∼30–40 atoms) cluster that serves as a model for a semi-conductor nanostructured material like TiO2, ZnO or NiO.24b,25,26 Recently, De Angelis and co-workers have studied and reviewed the computational aspects of modelling type-I DSSCs.27 Based on simple orbital symmetry rules, Troisi and co-workers have proposed strategies to minimize charge recombination in DSSCs.28 Based on TD-DFT calculations, Prezhdo and Duncan have studied DSSCs based on catechol and alizarin that are attached to TiO2.29 Their calculations provided an atomistic understanding of the mechanism of photoexcitation of an electron of the dye directly onto the nanoparticle, thereby establishing the working of a type-II DSSC.In this work, we have studied the DSSC properties of porphyrin and their derivatives adsorbed on anatase nanoclusters. Since porphyrin molecules are an integral part of the nature's own photosynthetic light-harvesting pigments (chlorophylls), their ground state and photoexcited state properties have been extensively studied both experimentally30 and theoretically.31–33 On the other hand, the electronic structure for bulk anatase and its clusters of various sizes and shapes have been the subject of active first-principles calculations.34,35 Nevertheless, first principles calculations for the mechanism of photoinduced electron transfer for the entire system, namely the porphyrin⋯anatase complex, are lacking in the literature. While, based on the individual positions of HOMO and LUMO levels of porphyrin and anatase clusters (valence band and conduction band levels in the case of bulk anatase), one can predict their DSSC performance, adsorption of the molecules on the cluster can lead to further complications. For example, porphyrin molecules have been shown to form various types of aggregates (H and J type) over anatase surfaces of which the J type aggregates exhibit improved photoinduced charge separation due to faster exciton dynamics compared to that for an H-type aggregate.36,37 Even under dilute conditions, wherein the aggregation of molecules over the nanoparticle surface is minimized, the coordination of porphyrin with the TiO2 cluster leads to the intrusion of many additional optically active states including charge-transfer (CT) states from the molecule to the semi-conductor. We find that such a coordination leads to a puckering of the ideally two-dimensional (2D) porphyrin system, which induces properties for both type-I and type-II DSSCs. Based on various donor and acceptor functionalization and the nature and site of interaction of the molecule with the cluster, we show that one can selectively enhance their performances for either type of DSSC. We propose that, as a general rule, not only does the LUMO level of the free dye need to be above the LUMO (CB level) of free TiO2 but additionally the LUMO for the dye⋯TiO2 complex needs to above the CB of bulk TiO2 to minimize electron trapping on the molecule–semiconductor surface for efficient photoinduced electron generation.Computational methodsThe choice of a DFT functional that can satisfactorily describe both the ground state structures of TiO2 and the organic dye complex and their excited states is a formidable challenge. The tendency of the general gradient approximation (GGA) to underestimate the experimental band-gaps of semi-conductors is well-known. One therefore needs to choose a hybrid DFT functional (with the correct proportion of the HF exchange) which satisfactorily reproduces the band-gap. Since the efficiency of the charge-injection depends on the orientation of the dye with respect to the semi-conductor, a proper description of the structure is essential, which, in turn, requires inclusion of the dispersion interactions as well. Also, the transfer of photo-excited electrons from the dye to the semi-conductor might involve charge-transfer states. In this context, the Truhlar's highly parameterized metahybrid method, namely, the M06-2X version of DFT, is known to describe accurately both dispersion interactions in complexes and has been shown to be adequate for the description of intermediate range of electron–electron interactions involved in charge-transfer (CT).38 Therefore, all the ground state structure optimization quantum chemical computations were performed using the M06-2X DFT method.39,40 For the excited states (TD-DFT calculations), we perform both M06-2X level and the popular B3LYP calculations to verify the suitability of the hybrid functionals. Since the nanoparticle is modeled as a TiO2 cluster, the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) double-ζ effective core potential (ECP) basis set was employed for optimization of the TiO2 particle.41 All the calculations are performed using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs.42 Additional harmonic frequency calculations were performed to verify that the structures do not correspond to saddle-points. The singlet–singlet absorption processes were modeled using TD-DFT calculations for at least 10–15 states in free porphyrins and 50–60 states for the porphyrin⋯TiO2 complexes. Incorporation of more states in the calculations for the complexes is found to be essential due to the presence of a large number of metal-like closely spaced optically weak active levels in TiO2. The binding energies for the cluster⋯TiO2 complex was calculated as ΔEBinding = E(TiO2⋯Molecule) − E(TiO2) − E(Molecule). For the free molecules, the ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) was calculated as GSOP = (G0 − G+)GS where G0 and G+ are the Gibb's free energies (at 298 K) for the neutral and the oxidized molecule in their ground-state relaxed geometries, respectively. The GSOP provides a more realistic indication for the ground state of a molecule compared to its HOMO energy level within a hybrid DFT level of calculations.43,44 The excited state oxidation potential (ESOP) for these molecules are calculated ESOP = GSOP − Gadiabatic0–0 where Gadiabatic0–0 is the adiabatic free energy involved in the lowest optically-active transition. However, since obtaining the Gadiabatic0–0 term involves finding the optimized structure of the excited state of a molecule (along with its harmonic frequencies and zero-point energy corrections), explicit calculation of this quantity for a molecule of the dimension of porphyrin is computationally intractable. Therefore, we approximate ESOP as ESOP(approx.) = GSOP − Evertical0–0 where Evertical0–0 is the vertical energy involved in the lowest optically-active transition which is readily available from the TD-DFT calculations of the molecules. Analyses of the molecule⋯TiO2 interactions were performed through the atoms-in-molecule (AIM) approach.45Results and discussionThe ground-state optimized structures for porphyrin with various acceptor functionalizations at the meso positions (A = –COOH, –OH and –NO2) and with various donor and mixed donor–acceptor functionalizations (D = –NH2, –N(CH3)2; D = –NH2, A = –COOH; D = –NH2, A = –NO2; D = –N(CH3)2, A = –COOH; D = –N(CH3)2, A = –SO3H and D = –N(CH3)2, A = –PO3H2) are shown in Fig. 1 and 2 respectively. The presence of D–A or mixed D–A functionalization, apart from effecting the orbital energies (discussed later), also leads to a loss of planarity in the tetra-pyrrole moiety. For example, the tetra-substituted –NO2 and –N(CH3)2 porphyrins have a dihedral angle, Φ(N(1)–N(2)H–N(3)–N(4)H) = 3.6 and 3.3 degrees respectively. The dihedral angles for the all systems are also reported in Fig. 1 and 2. Reduction in the symmetry of the porphyrin molecule from a D2h symmetry on D/A/D–A functionalization, is therefore expected to enrich transition dipoles also along the Z-axes (perpendicular to the plane), Mmnz. This leads to additional absorption bands apart from the well-known Soret (Bx and By) and Q (Qx and Qy) absorption bands in unsubstituted porphyrin. For free porphyrin, at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level, the Bx and By bands correspond to 371.5 nm (oscillator strength, f = 0.40) and 352.4 (oscillator strength, f = 0.65) while the Qx and Qy bands correspond to 544.0 nm (oscillator strength, f = 0.0015) and 504.6 (oscillator strength, f = 0.0001) respectively. This is in good agreement with experimentally observed Bx (372.3 nm, f = 1.15), By (372.3 nm, f = 1.15), Qx (626.2 nm, f = 0.01) and Qy (512.3 nm, f = 0.06). In the case of the tetra-substituted –NO2 and –N(CH3)2 porphyrins, puckering leads to non-zero transition dipole moments, Mmnz = 0.29 Debye and 0.46 Debye respectively leading to new absorption peaks at 316.6 nm (f = 0.0012) and 295.7 (f = 0.0034) respectively. Table 1 lists the six most intense (high f) absorption peaks for all the dyes along with the absorption peaks arising out of puckering in the substituted porphyrins.

The Ti5O7 and Ti10O17 clusters have HOMO–LUMO gaps of 4.13 eV and 3.8 eV respectively. While, the HOMO–LUMO gaps for these clusters are still higher than the experimental band gap of anatase crystal (3.2 eV),35 they compare well with the previously calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps of 4.08 eV for Ti8O16 (ref. 46) and 3.78 eV for a larger cluster, Ti38O76.24b All the calculations for the composite systems (TiO2⋯dye) are therefore performed on the 1.5 nm diameter, Ti10O17.47Out of the several possibilities for the orientation of the dyes over TiO2, the most stable ones are either horizontally placed over TiO2 or vertically standing on TiO2. For the unsubstituted porphyrin, the dye is located horizontally over the cluster (shown in Fig. 3(a)) with short contact distances between the two non-protonated N-ends and the Ti and O atoms of TiO2 (dN(1)⋯Ti = 2.24 Å and dN(3)⋯O = 2.60 Å). The binding energy is calculated as −59.8 kcal mol−1. A plot of the critical points of the electron density (ρ) shows bond-critical point (BCP) in between the N-atoms of porphyrin and Ti/O atoms of the cluster (Fig. 3(b)) with ρBCP[N(1)⋯Ti] = 2.02 × 10−2 a.u.; ∇2ρBCP[N(1)⋯Ti] = −2.42 × 10−2 a.u. and ρBCP[N(3)⋯O] = 5.62 × 10−2 a.u.; ∇2ρBCP [N(3)⋯O] = −5.05 × 10−2 a.u. respectively. Small values for ρBCP and small negative values for ∇2ρBCP are indicative of weak covalent interactions48 between the N-atoms and the TiO2 cluster. Natural Bond Orbital calculations (NBO) show that the N(1)⋯Ti bond is mostly a coordinate bond of the type N → Ti with a 90.3% contribution from the N-atom and only a 9.7% contribution from the Ti-atom. The occupancy of the N(1)⋯Ti bond is 1.85e. Coordination of the N-atoms on porphyrin leads to disruption of the aromaticity associated with its 18πe configuration thereby puckering it (Φ(N(1)–N(2)H–N(3)–N(4)H) = 1.69 degrees). The presence of either D and A groups on porphyrin further stabilizes the dye⋯TiO2 complex due to enhanced CT from dye → TiO2. For example, tetra-NH2, –OH and –COOH substituted porphyrins have 40.1 kcal mol−1, 29.9 and 15.9 kcal mol−1 higher binding energies with TiO2 compared to that for porphyrin. Groups like –COOH, –PO3H2 and –SO3H, apart from facilitating CT (due to – R/–I effects), also act as anchors to bind the dye to the TiO2 surface. This is evident from the fact that the vertical orientation of porphyrin over TiO2 is stable only in the presence of anchoring groups. The structure of such a vertical Me2N–Por–SO3H⋯TiO2 complex is shown in Fig. 3(c). Nevertheless, the calculations suggest a delicate balance exists between binding through the N-ends of porphyrin leading to a horizontal arrangement of the molecule over TiO2 and binding through the anchoring groups that can lead to a vertical molecule and TiO2 arrangement. The binding energies for all the complexes are reported in Table 2.

However, the presence of a large number of metallic-like states for TiO2 makes the LUMO energy level superfluous. A more reasonable estimate for the CB energy level of TiO2 can be determined through the flatband energy of TiO2, Vflb = −0.58 V with respect to NHE (at pH = 7, assuming Nernst-like behavior of the TiO2 electrode).8 Scaling the energy of a NHE reference electrode in water to the vacuum level (EvacuumCB (in eV) = −4.44 − Vflb), the energy of the CB of TiO2 is estimated as −3.86 eV.27a As seen from Table 2, the LUMO for all the dyes are above (less stable) the EvacuumCB of the semi-conductor. Hence, simplistically one might assume that electrons can be photoinjected from these dyes to the TiO2. However, the fabrication of any device must essentially involve a reasonable concentration of the dye for an effective charge injection cross-section. Therefore, the re-arrangement of the energy levels due to adsorption of the dye over TiO2via chemical interactions as described above needs to be considered. Comparing LUMO levels of the dye⋯TiO2 complex and EvacuumCB of the TiO2 electrode, we find that strong acceptors like the tetra-NO2 group stabilize the LUMO of the complex to such a large extent that its lies very close to EvacuumCB. Therefore, substitution of strong acceptor groups is predicted to hamper charge injection into the electrode. On the other hand, the presence of a strong donor group like tetra-NH2 or –NMe2 places the LUMO of the dye⋯TiO2 complex above the EvacuumCB by as much as 1 eV. However, a strong donor group also leads to the simultaneous destabilization of the HOMO of the dye. For the reversibility of the solar cell, the HOMO level of the dye must be well below the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple (0.4 V vs. NHE; E(I−/I3−)vacuum (in eV) = −4.44 − VNHE = −4.84 eV). For example, for the tetra-amino substituted porphyrin, the HOMO energy of the dye lies above E(I−/I3−)vacuum while for the tetra-dimethylamino substituted porphyrin, the levels are just matching. Hence, we predict that neither very strong donors nor very strong acceptors should be functionalized on porphyrins for suitable DSSC applications. On the other hand, moderate functionalization of porphyrins by either donors or acceptors in the meso positions (1/2/3 of the 4 available sites) or the presence of weak donors like tetra-OH groups can act as suitable dyes for sensitization. The presence of acceptor groups has the additional advantage of their acting as an anchor for binding the molecule vertically over the TiO2 surface. However, a D–A hybrid functionalized porphyrin, apart from satisfying all the above conditions, also has low optical gaps (Evertical0–0 ∼ 3 eV) which lead to enhanced Incident Photon to Current Conversion Efficiencies (IPCE) between 350–600 nm.19 For example, the GSOP–ESOP gap decreases from 3.873 eV in free porphyrin to 2.937 eV, 3.067 eV and 3.317 eV for bi Me2N–porphyrin–bi COOH, bi H2N–porphyrin–bi COOH and Me2N–porphyrin–COOH respectively. Also, a D–π–A⋯TiO2 anchored configuration has an added advantage of unidirectional photoinduced ET leading to a maximally charge-separated state with a smaller probability of electron–hole recombination (discussed later).Our computed values of HOMO and LUMO energy levels are in good agreement with the GSOP and ESOP values calculated for the dyes and corroborates our finding that neither a very strong donor or a very strong acceptor should be substituted in porphyrin for solar energy harvesting. For effective charge injection from the to the semi-conductor, we suggest that a relay or funnel-like electron transfer mechanism must be operative whereby the photoexcited electron hops from the LUMO level of the dye to the LUMO level of the dye⋯TiO2 complex,and finally gets transferred to the CB of TiO2. Fig. 4 shows schematically the proposed mechanism of type-I electron transfer between the dye and semi-conductor (pathway A). Therefore, not only does the LUMO level of the dye needs to be above the EvacuumCB of TiO2 (a positive value for ε1) but the energy difference between the LUMO level of the dye and the LUMO level of the dye⋯TiO2 complex (ε2) and the energy difference between the LUMO level of the dye⋯TiO2 complex and EvacuumCB of TiO2 (ε3) need to be individually positive. Table 2 reports the values for ε1, ε2 and ε3 for all the systems considered in this study along with the vertical energy for optical transition, Evertical0–0. For the tetra-COOH substituted porphyrin, even though the overall ε1 is positive, ε3 is negative which makes it inefficient for light harvesting. Gratzel has recommended that the LUMO level of the sensitizer should be at least ∼0.5 eV higher than the EvacuumCB for efficient solar energy-to-current conversion.8 For the tri-COOH substituted porphyrin, di H2N–porphyrin–NO2 and Me2N–porphyrin–di COOH, ε3 are ≤0.5 eV thereby making them less appealing prospective candidates for DSSCs. Also, for Me2N–porphyrin–SO3H, ε2 is <0.5 eV which we also propose to be not ideal for use in type-I DSSC. Fig. 4  Mechanism for dual and simultaneously allowed photoinduced electron injection from dye → TiO2via type I (pathway A) and type II (pathway B) processes. The performance of these dyes for the type-II DSSC pathway was also investigated. In the dye⋯TiO2 complexes, TD-DFT calculated optical transitions were examined to decipher significantly intense charge-transfer transitions directly from the dye → TiO2. For most of the dye⋯TiO2 complexes, these transitions are weak with f ∼ 10−3–10−4. Nevertheless, the Me2N–porphyrin–COOH⋯TiO2 (f = 0.0704, λCT = 449.8 nm, HOMO − 5 → LUMO transition), Me2N–porphyrin–PO3H2⋯TiO2 (f = 0.0198, λCT = 624.5 nm, HOMO − 2 → LUMO transition), di H2N–porphyrin–di NO2⋯TiO2 (f = 0.0862, λCT = 601.6 nm, HOMO − 3 → LUMO transition), Me2N–porphyrin–SO3H⋯TiO2 (f = 0.0689, λCT = 539.1 nm, HOMO − 2 → LUMO + 2 transition), tetra-NO2–porphyrin⋯TiO2 (f = 0.0734, λCT = 573.4 nm, HOMO − 1 → LUMO + 1 transition) and Me2N–porphyrin–di COOH⋯TiO2 (f = 0.0579, λCT = 452.7 nm, HOMO − 1 → LUMO + 2 transition) complexes show promising type-II behavior. Also, since these CT transitions occur in the visible region, their IPCE performance is also expected to be satisfactory. Fig. 5 shows these CT MO states for four typical molecules which unequivocally represent the dye → TiO2 transitions. The best type-II DSSC performance is calculated for di H2N–porphyrin–di NO2⋯TiO2 which is not suitable for the type-I DSSC mechanism as ε3 < 0.5 eV. However, we would like to stress that type-I and type-II mechanisms of DSSCs are not mutually exclusive. For example, Me2N–porphyrin–COOH⋯TiO2 and Me2N–porphyrin–PO3H2⋯TiO2 are calculated to be efficient for both type-I and type-II mechanisms (Fig. 4, pathway B). Such a dual and simultaneous mechanism of photosensitization in solar cells for the same composite is interesting. We therefore predict that when the concentration of the dye is high, for which there will be aggregation over the semi-conductor surface, a type-II mechanism of DSSCs will dominate. For diluted dye solutions, the type-I pathway should contribute more. Fig. 5  CT orbitals involved in direct photoinduced electron injection (type-II mechanism) from dye → TiO2 in (a) Me2N–porphyrin–COOH⋯TiO2, (b) Me2N–porphyrin–PO3H2⋯TiO2, (c) di NH2–porphyrin–di NO2⋯TiO2 and (d) Me2N–porphyrin–SO3H⋯TiO2. Calculations were performed at the M06-2X/LANL2DZ level. The above discussed screening of dyes for type-I and type-II type DSSC processes does not include the possibility of charge recombination. Charge recombination (CR) can occur through two processes namely, through space tunneling (Tspace) and through bonds (Tbond).49 We expect that for the dyes which are stacked horizontally over the semi-conductor surface, Tspace will predominate, while for dyes that are anchored by the donor groups vertically, Tbond is more important. Since, the rate of electron tunneling (both forward and backward)50 scales as kET ∼ e−βL, the only way to minimize CR through Tspace is to increase distance (L) between the dye and the semi-conductor which shall also simultaneously reduce their efficiencies for the forward process of charge injection into the semi-conductor. Therefore, unfortunately, there is no strategy to enhance forward charge injection and minimize charge recombination for the horizontally orientated dyes. However, in the cases where the dyes are oriented vertically above the TiO2 surface and held by the anchoring groups like –COOH, –SO3H and –PO3H2, the ratio of the orbital density of LUMO to that of the HOMO for the anchoring groups [Qanchor = Σi(CLUMOi)2/Σi(CHOMOi)2, where the Ci's are MO coefficients of expansion of the HOMO and LUMO over the atomic orbitals basis of the anchoring atoms] of the dyes can be an important parameter to minimize CR without affecting charge injection probabilities.28 As discussed above, a semi-conductor generally has large number of MO's of different symmetries within the band-width and hence there will invariably be some MO of the correct symmetry in TiO2 to couple with the HOMO of the dye to facilitate charge injection. However, in order to have charge recombination, the electron from the semi-conductor needs to enter the dye via the anchor. Therefore, if the LUMO of the dye is considerably more localized on the anchors and has a small contribution from the chromophoric unit, back ET will be hampered. Hence, as a rule of thumb, for dyes that are bound by anchoring groups to the semi-conductor surface vertically, they should have small contributions of the anchoring groups in HOMO and large contributions in the LUMO (large Qanchor) for quenched charge recombination probabilities.28 Such a design will facilitate easy forward charge injection (via Tspace since HOMO has little contribution from the anchors) and difficult backward charge recombination (inefficient Tbond since LUMO has little contribution from dye). Fig. 6 shows the HOMO and LUMO plots for the dyes that anchor the TiO2 surface vertically along with their Qanchor values. Clearly, di H2N–porphyrin–di NO2 and di Me2N–porphyrin–di COOH have the least CR probabilities while Me2N–porphyrin–COOH is predicted to have the largest CR. For Me2N–porphyrin–PO3H2 and Me2N–porphyrin–SO3H, the CR is also expected to be large. Fig. 6  HOMO and LUMO plots for (a) di NH2–porphyrin–di COOH, (b) di Me2N–porphyrin–di COOH, (c) Me2N–porphyrin–SO3H, (d) Me2N–porphyrin–PO3H2 and (e) Me2N–porphyrin–COOH. The ratios of the LUMO and HOMO charge densities in the anchor groups (Q) are also reported. Calculations were performed at the M06-2X/LANL2DZ level. ConclusionOur first principles calculations for the DSSC efficiencies of porphyrin derivatives on TiO2 surfaces provide design strategies to enhance their performance. We suggest that porphyrin should not be substituted with either a very strong donor or a very strong acceptor moiety as both hamper the reversibility of a DSSC device by destabilizing the HOMO and stabilizing the LUMO level of the dye respectively. Porphyrin⋯TiO2 interactions are found to control the efficiencies of both type-I and type-II mechanisms for DSSCs. For efficient electron transfer from the dye to the semiconductor surface via a hopping or relay process in a type-I mechanism, the LUMO level of the dye⋯TiO2 complex should be lower than that for the free dye, which in turn should be above the CB level of the semiconductor. The presence of an anchoring group like –SO3H, –COOH or –PO3H2, apart from stabilizing a D–porphyrin–A system, also orients the dye vertically over the semi-conductor surface. For such a vertically aligned dye over TiO2, charge recombination is found to be less probable in di H2N–porphyrin–di COOH and di Me2N–porphyrin–di COOH due to small contributions of the anchoring atoms to the HOMO orbital density. Most importantly, our calculations show that molecules like Me2N–porphyrin–COOH and Me2N–porphyrin–PO3H2, when adsorbed on TiO2, are capable of exhibiting good DSSC efficiencies via both type-I and type-II mechanism. Recent experimental work by Gratzel and co-workers on such a –NR2 donor and –COOH acceptor porphyrin-based system has shown the highest reported (ruthenium free) solar-to-electric power efficiency of 11%, thereby supporting our calculations.51 We believe that there exists no such general rule that only different sets of molecules shall show type-I and type-II processes of DSSC. We predict that under low concentrations of dye, when the possibility of adsorption of dye over TiO2 is less, type-I processes shall dominate, and with increasing concentrations of dye, type-II mechanisms shall be more active. Such a mechanistic switch-over for a single dye at different concentrations can have exciting applications for designing smart DSSC materials. Since a type-II process essentially involves direct CT from the dye to TiO2, an onset of a CT band in the absorption spectra of the dye as its concentration increases can be a convenient experimental test to prove our computational prediction.AcknowledgementsAD and SMP thank CSIR India for financial assistance.

are exactly equal to that for the neutral molecules and the system is represented as a single Slater determinant while neglecting the dynamic electron correlation, exact KS-DFT satisfies the Koopman's theorem (DFT version) so that εHighest KS = −IE (Ionization energy). Nevertheless, since computations on reasonably sized molecules are invariably performed using hybrid DFT, the estimates of IE from Koopmans' approximation are rather poor. Nevertheless, recent progress in the development of optimally-tuned range-separated hybrid (RSH) functionals (  T. Stein, J. Autschbach, N. Govind, L. Kronik and R. Baer, J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2012, 3, 3740 Search PubMed  ) shows promising results of bringing orbital energies (OE) close to the −IE (within ∼0.05 eV).
