, Accepted 27th April 2015First published on 27th April 2015AbstractTo improve the power conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), a DSSC based on a transparent counter electrode (CE) and a piece of new aluminium foil as a reflector was devised. Owing to the simultaneous sunlight irradiation from the rear side, more dye molecules are excited and more carriers are generated, which greatly enhances the short-circuit current density and power conversion efficiency. In this work, a transparent electrode of nickel sulfide decorated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (NiS/PEDOT) was prepared by a two-step electrochemical/chemical process. The NiS/PEDOT hybrid electrode utilizes the advances made in the use of NiS and PEDOT as the counter electrode for DSSCs. The incorporation of PEDOT conductive networks provides additional pathways for electron transport in the NiS/PEDOT hybrid electrode and thus facilitates increasing charge-transfer rate at the interface of the CE/electrolyte. The DSSC based on the NiS/PEDOT CE and a piece of new aluminium foil as a reflector achieved a higher power conversion efficiency of 8.47% compared to that of a DSSC irradiated from the front only (7.77%) under the irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G). The strategy of adding new aluminium foil as a reflector is of practical maneuverability and reference use than that of used two lights or mirrors, which provides a new and promising approach for enhancing the photovoltaic performances of solar cells in practice.
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have received considerable attention due to their unique advantages such as relative low cost, high efficiency, facile fabrication, and environmentally friendly.1,2 The highest power conversion efficiency a DSSC has achieved is over 13%.3 As an important component of DSSCs, the counter electrode (CE) plays an important role in the performance of DSSCs. Platinum (Pt), very widely used as a CE material, exhibits excellent catalytic activity, but at high cost, and also incurs problems of Pt dissolution in corrosive electrolyte, which severely restricts the large-scale application for DSSCs.4 Consequently, the search for an inexpensive Pt-like catalyst has become one of the priorities in the field. Among the various types of Pt-free CE alternatives, carbon materials, organic conducting polymers and transition metal compounds5–13 have been extensively researched as CEs for DSSCs in recent years. Moreover, it was also found that composite materials consisting of carbon materials, organic conducting polymers or transition metal compounds with great electrocatalytic ability in iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) electrolytes can serve as CE in DSSCs.14–18 Xiao et al. reported that a DSSC assembled with the PEDOT/MWCNT CE exhibited a superior photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 7.03% compared to that of the DSSC with a Pt CE (5.88%).19 Wang reported the use of two selenides, Co0.85Se and Ni0.85Se, as CEs in DSSCs, and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 9.40% were obtained.20
Based on the abovementioned analysis, it can be inferred that the electrocatalytic property of composite catalytic materials made from organic conducting polymers and transition metal compounds as CEs for DSSCs could be improved greatly. On the other hand, enhancing the sunlight harvesting could improve the PCE of solar cells.21,22 Consequently, a DSSC incorporating a piece of new aluminium foil as a reflector to enhance the light capture based on the transparent NiS/PEDOT CE was envisaged. The transparent NiS/PEDOT CE with low charge transfer resistance as well as excellent electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction was characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Incident light perpendicularly irradiated on the front side of the DSSC and the transmitted light through the DSSC and around the edges of the device were reused by reflecting the light onto the rear side of the DSSC. The DSSC with the NiS/PEDOT CE and a piece of new aluminium foil achieved an enhanced photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 8.47% under the irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G).
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation of the NiS/PEDOT counter electrode
First, the NiS CE was prepared using the electrodeposition method as follows.23,24 Briefly, the electrodeposition was carried out with an electrochemical analyzer system (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua Device Company, China). All the experiments were implemented in a three-electrode cell, including one Pt foil as the CE, one Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and fluorine-doped tin oxide transparent (FTO) with an exposed area of 0.64 cm2 as the working electrode. The base electrodeposition solution consisted of 0.05 M nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O, 98%) and 1.0 M thiourea (≥99.0%) solution in 50 mL deionized water and was treated by ultrasonication for 30 min. A constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 was utilized for the electrodeposition. The obtained NiS CE was put into 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP)/ethanol solution for 10 min, and then placed in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 12 h.
Second, the modification of the NiS CE was immersed in 0.015 M 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomer solution (called solution A), and then 25.1 g L−1 ammonium persulphate solution (called solution B) and 0.18 mM ferric sulfate solution (called solution C) were rapidly added into solution A at 4 °C for 6 h, resulting in an in situ polymerization reaction of EDOT monomers into the NiS nanoparticles (the preparation route shown in Fig. 1).

For comparison, the PEDOT CE was prepared by immersing 0.015 M EDOT, 25.1 g L−1 ammonium persulphate and 0.18 mM ferric sulfate solution at 4 °C for 6 h; the Pt CE was subjected to electropolymerization from the plating solution consisting of 0.01 M H2PtCl6 and 14 wt% HCl.
2.2 Fabrication of DSSC
The TiO2 anode was prepared as described previously.25,26 The dye was loaded by immersing the TiO2 anode in to 0.3 mM of dye Z-907 ethanol solution for 12 h. Thus, dye-sensitized TiO2 anode with a thickness of 8–10 μm was obtained. The DSSC was fabricated by injecting the liquid electrolyte (0.05 M of I2, 0.1 M of LiI, 0.6 M of tetrabutylammonium iodide and 0.5 M of 4-tert-butyl-pyridine in acetonitrile) into the aperture between the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and the CE. The two electrodes were clipped together and wrapped with thermoplastic hot-melt Surlyn.
2.3 Characterization
The surface morphology of the sample was observed using a JSM-7001F FE-SEM system. CV and EIS were conducted using a computer-controlled electrochemical analyzer (CHI 660E, CH Instrument). The electrolyte used in the DSSC test was also injected into the symmetric dummy cells for the EIS measurements. EIS was carried out under simulated open-circuit conditions at ambient atmosphere, sealed with thermoplastic hot-melt Surlyn and left an exposed area of 0.64 cm2. The frequency of the applied sinusoidal AC voltage signal varied from 0.1 Hz to 105 Hz and the corresponding amplitude was kept at 5 mV in all cases.
The photovoltaic testing of the DSSC with an exposed area of 0.4 × 0.7 cm2 was carried out by measuring the photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) character curve under white light irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) from a solar simulator (XQ-500W, Shanghai Photoelectricity Device Company, China) in ambient atmosphere. One piece of new aluminum foil was put under the DSSC and used as reflector to reflect the lights (the light irradiation of about 40 mW cm−2) from the rear direction of the counter electrode. The fill factor (FF) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the DSSC were calculated according to the following equations:

(2)where Jsc is the short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), Voc is the open-circuit voltage (V), Pin is the incident light power (mW cm−2), and Jmax (mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage at the point of the maximum power output in the J–V curve, respectively.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Surface morphology and composition of the samples
Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the PEDOT, NiS, NiS/PEDOT films and the EDS image of the NiS/PEDOT CE. Fig. 2a shows that the PEDOT film using the in situ polymerization shows a network structure surface morphology on the FTO substrate, which is favorable for the penetration of electrolyte. As seen as in Fig. 2b, the NiS nanoparticles can uniformly arrange onto the FTO substrate to give a perfectly smooth surface. Compared to Fig. 2a and b, the NiS/PEDOT film (Fig. 2c) interestingly presents a smooth morphology of NiS nanoparticles and a PEDOT network integrated tightly, intercrossed and penetrating. Such a structure will provide additional pathways for electron transport in the NiS/PEDOT hybrid electrode, favoring the permeation of the iodide/triiodide electrolyte and sunlight transmission, and thus accelerating photogenerated charge carriers' production and transportation.27 The EDS analysis of the NiS/PEDOT hybrid electrode (Fig. 2d) indicates the presence of C, N, O, S and Ni elements, which demonstrates qualitatively the preparation of NiS/PEDOT onto the FTO substrate. To further characterize the sulfide composition, the XRD characterization was also carried out and is presented in Fig. 2e. For comparison, the XRD of FTO was also tested under the same conditions. From the XRD spectrum, it can be seen that the signals of FTO were very strong, almost even covering the signals of the sulfide, but the crystalline phase of NiS can still be clearly observed at 33.8°, according to the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS card no. 3-1149). From the XRD data, it can be confirmed that the NiS film was obtained using the electrochemical deposition method.

Fig. 3 exhibits the transmittances of the four types of CEs with the best electrocatalytic activity. The Pt CE has an average transmittance of about 52% in the wavelength range of 360–800 nm. The PEDOT CE shows better transmittance in the wavelength range of 360–670 nm than Pt CE. This is due to high reflectivity of the Pt CE. The NiS CE displays a lower transmittance than PEDOT CE in the wavelength range of 360–640 nm with long deposition time to meet the requirements for catalytic activity. The NiS/PEDOT electrode shows a more improved transmittance in the wavelength range of 360–800 nm than Pt, NiS, and PEDOT CEs when modified with 4-ATP. This is due to the 4-ATP acting as a bridging agent to improve the combination of FTO or NiS layer via the –SH group. The NiS/PEDOT electrode shows higher transmittance in the dye-sensitized range of 400–750 nm and therefore is a better candidate than Pt as a CE for the DSSC.

3.2 Electrochemical properties
To investigate the electrocatalytic ability of the various CEs, CV curves were obtained in the scan interval ranging from −0.4 to 0.4 V vs. Pt, according to the previous reports.28,29 The anodic peaks are responsible for the reaction of 3I− → I3− + 2e−, and the cathodic peaks are vital for the performance of DSSCs and correspond to I3− + 2e− → 3I−. The cathodic peak potential (Vpc) is inversely correlated and the current density (Ipc) is positively correlated to the catalytic activity of CE.30 Fig. 4 shows the CVs for the Pt, PEDOT, NiS and NiS/PEDOT CEs at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The corresponding parameters of Ipc and Vpc obtained from the CV curves are listed in Table 1. From Table 1 and Fig. 4, the Pt, PEDOT and NiS CEs can be seen to have a similar |Ipc|. This signifies that both the NiS and PEDOT CEs possess a Pt-like electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction. The Vpc of the abovementioned CEs increases in the order of NiS (−0.25 ± 0.01 V) < Pt (−0.18 ± 0.01 V) < PEDOT (−0.14 ± 0.01 V) < NiS/PEDOT (−0.12 ± 0.01 V), which is immediately responsible for the lower overpotential loss in the NiS/PEDOT CE than in the NiS or PEDOT CEs, since the highly conductive PEDOT was incorporated within NiS nanoparticles. Consequently, the fact that both Ipc and Vpc indicate that the electrocatalytic activity and conductivity of the NiS/PEDOT CE can be further enhanced for their synergistic catalytic effect of NiS and PEDOT originated from their excellent intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and electrical conductivity.

Moreover, the diffusion coefficient (Dn) of I3− for the Pt, NiS, PEDOT and NiS/PEDOT CEs can be estimated to be 2.78 × 10−6, 2.63 × 10−6, 3.00 × 10−6 and 4.79 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1, respectively, according to the Randles–Sevcik equation mentioned as follows:31 
Ipc = Kn1.5AC(Dn)0.5v0.5
(3)where Ipc is the cathodic current density, K is a constant of 2.69 × 105, n means the number of electrodes contributing to the charge transfer (here, n = 2), A is the area of the CE and C and v represent the concentration of the I3− species and the scan rate, respectively.
Thus, it can be found that the diffusivity for the NiS/PEDOT CE is slightly larger than that of the Pt, PEDOT and NiS CEs, which indicates that the NiS/PEDOT CE possesses a considerably faster rate for the I−/I3− reaction.
Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b show 100 successive CV cycles of the NiS/PEDOT CE and the behaviors of the max. anode peak current density (Ipa) and Ipc at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Both the max. Ipa and Ipc did not change significantly with the cycle number increasing, indicating that the NiS/PEDOT CE possesses great electrochemical reversibility and stability.32 Fig. 5c shows that the current density versus (scan rate)1/2 plots have a good linear relationship. This phenomenon apparently suggests that the adsorption of iodide species has almost no effect of redox reaction on the NiS/PEDOT CE surface, indicating that there is no specific interaction between the I−/I3− redox couple and the NiS/PEDOT CE, as there is with the Pt electrode.

Fig. 6 represents the Nyquist plots of the Pt, NiS, PEDOT and NiS/PEDOT CEs. The equivalent circuit is shown in the inset, and the related electrocatalytic performance parameters are summarized in Table 1, in which the high-frequency intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs), including the sheet resistance of two identical CEs and the electrolytic resistance. The first semicircle at high frequency refers to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) for the I3− reduction at the CE|electrolyte interface, and the second semicircle at low frequency represents the Nernst diffusion impedance (Zw), corresponding to the diffusion resistance of the I−/I3− redox species.33,34 As seen in Fig. 6 and Table 1, the NiS, PEDOT and NiS/PEDOT CEs are provided with a similar Rs of about 6.9–7.2 Ω cm2, indicating that the CEs are firmly bonded to the FTO substrate as well as to the Pt electrode, which was discussed in the CV section. The Rct is inversely correlated with the electrocatalytic activity of the CE, and the order of the CEs follows NiS > PEDOT > Pt > NiS/PEDOT, as shown in Table 1. This indicates that the NiS/PEDOT CE possesses a comparable reaction rate for the I−/I3− regeneration on their surface to that of the Pt CE. It is noticeable that a considerably lower Rct value can be obtained for the NiS/PEDOT CE, while the conductive PEDOT was incorporated as extra channels for electron transport and for a synergistic effect.35 Furthermore, the Zw arising from limitations in the mass transportation of the electrolyte cannot be ignored, particularly in the PEDOT film. Compared to the Pt and NiS CEs, the PEDOT CE has a larger Zw of 9.35 ± 0.01 Ω cm2, which is related to its film thickness. However, the Zw of NiS/PEDOT CE is found to be 0.67 ± 0.01 Ω cm2, which is considerably smaller than that of the Pt, NiS and PEDOT CEs. This result shows that the electrocatalytic performance of the NiS/PEDOT CE, upon incorporation with the highly conductive PEDOT network, is significantly improved.

In addition to the EIS analyses, the Tafel test is another mean to aid investigation into the interfacial charge-transfer properties of the I−/I3− redox couple on the CEs. Fig. 7 gives the Tafel curves of the Pt, NiS, PEDOT and NiS/PEDOT CEs. The curves present the logarithmic current density as a function of the potential. The detailed polarization analyses can be found in the previous studies.36 The exchange current density (J0) is obtained as the intercept of the extrapolated linear region of the curve when the overpotential is zero, which is inversely related to Rct, as illustrated in eqn (4),37 and is therefore considered as a quantitative factor for evaluating the electrocatalytic activity of a CE.

Thus, the order of Rct will be inferred to NiS/PEDOT < Pt < PEDOT < NiS CEs from J0, indicating the most excellent electrocatalytic activity for the NiS/PEDOT CE in I−/I3− redox couple, which can be logically expected to considerably improve the efficiency of a DSSC. These conclusions are consistent with the catalytic activity derived from the EIS and CV.
3.3 Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs with NiS/PEDOT CE
Fig. 8 shows the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs based on different CEs and directions under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 8a shows the J–V curves of the DSSCs with the Pt (a), NiS (b), PEDOT (c) and NiS/PEDOT (d) CEs irradiated only from the front and without using aluminum foil as the reflector, from which the obtained PCEs are 7.14%, 6.18%, 5.80% and 7.77%, respectively. The DSSC based on the NiS/PEDOT (d) CE achieved a PCE as high as 7.77%, which is higher than that of the DSSC with Pt, PEDOT or NiS CE only. The greatly improved performance of the DSSC assembled with NiS/PEDOT CE may possibly be derived from the synergistic catalytic effect of NiS and PEDOT from their excellent intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and electrical conductivity, and highly uniformity morphology, which provide an excellent contact area for the CE and electrolyte. When irradiated from the rear side, the PCEs of the DSSCs with the Pt and NiS CEs reduced more than that of the DSSCs based on the PEDOT and NiS/PEDOT CEs, as shown in Fig. 8b. This is due to the decrease in incident light intensity via the reflection by the Pt and NiS CEs, thus diminishing the photogenerated charge carriers and the light-to-electric conversion efficiency.

Interestingly, it can be observed from Fig. 8c that the DSSCs assembled with the Pt CE irradiated from the front and using a piece of new aluminum foil as the reflector achieve a PCE of 7.30%, which is higher than that of the DSSCs with the NiS and PEDOT CEs. Low efficiency for the DSSCs with NiS and PEDOT CEs is responsible for their CE low electrocatalytic activity and high resistance, as observed from Fig. 4 and 6, and the low transmittance of NiS CE. Compared with the DSSC with NiS CE, the efficiency and short-circuit current density of the DSSC with the PEDOT CE irradiated from the rear are remarkably less reduced, the main reason being the higher transmittance of PEDOT CE than that of NiS CE. The DSSC with the NiS/PEDOT CE obtained a PCE as high as 8.47% with aluminum foil as the reflector, which is an increase of 9.0% over the DSSC with front irradiation only. Due to the transparency and excellent electrocatalytic ability of the NiS/PEDOT CE, rear light penetrated and could be absorbed by the dye molecules and produced more photogenerated charge carriers in the device, resulting in a greatly enhanced short-circuit current density and power conversion efficiency. This strategy can be further improved by designing a better light-splitting device with vertical incidence and applying other devices with transparent CEs.
3.4 Schematic of the catalytic mechanisms of the samples
Fig. 9 shows the possible catalytic mechanisms of the NiS/PEDOT CE with the I3− electrolyte during the power conversion efficiency process for the DSSC. First, 4-ATP was introduced as a bridging agent via covalent bonding between NiS and the –SH end on 4-ATP and an in situ growth of a PEDOT chain on the –SH2 end on 4-ATP, showing a considerably better electrochemical behavior for iodide/triiodide. Furthermore, the incorporation of the highly conductive PEDOT network into the NiS nanoparticles introduces more pathways for electron transport and therefore facilitates the charge transfer across the CE/electrolyte interface, directly resulting in a higher electrocatalytic activity of the NiS/PEDOT CE and a consequent enhancement of the photovoltaic performance.

4. Conclusions
A transparent NiS/PEDOT counter electrode with significantly enhanced electrochemical performance was prepared by a two-step electrochemical/chemical process and proposed as a Pt-free counter electrode catalyst for DSSCs. As evidenced in the SEM images, NiS nanoparticles and the PEDOT network integrate tightly, intercross and penetrate, thus providing efficient pathways for electron transport and favoring the permeation of iodide/triiodide electrolyte and sunlight transmission. Electrochemical studies indicate that the synergistic effect of the NiS and PEDOT can efficiently facilitate electron transport and therefore enhance the charge-transfer rate for I3− reduction. Consequently, a DSSC assembled with the NiS/PEDOT counter electrode could achieve an impressive PCE of 8.47% under irradiation from the front and aluminum foil as a reflector, which greatly enhances the power conversion efficiency over that of a DSSC irradiated from the front only (7.77%). The strategy of enhancing the efficiency for DSSC offers the advantages of low cost, easy fabrication, and high throughput and therefore provides a new route for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of solar cells and other photovoltaic systems with transparent CEs.
