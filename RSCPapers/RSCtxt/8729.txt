    , Accepted 8th November 2018First published on 12th November 2018AbstractThe development of highly efficient and stable red (R) CsPb(Br0.35I0.65)3/CsPb2Br5 and green (G) CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br5 core/shell perovskite quantum dots (PeQDs) can facilitate the realization of highly efficient and wide-color-gamut, PeQD-emissive liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of red and green (RG) core/shell PeQDs reached ∼77.4% and ∼78.9%, respectively. The enhanced photo-stability, water-resistance, and thermal stability of RG core/shell PeQD films imply more opportunities to fabricate RG color-converting films with it to replace color filters (CFs) in conventional LCDs. The realization of color-by-blue PeQD-emissive LCDs can overcome technical challenges related to conventional CF-assisted LCDs, such as improved device efficiency and an enlarged color gamut. The relative conversion efficiency and color gamut of a color-by-blue PeQD-emissive LCD consisting of RG PeQD films sandwiched in the form of a RG-recycling bottom layer and a blue-filtering top dichroic filter are 1.94 times higher and 1.74 times wider than those of a conventional CF-LCD with a 2-phosphor-converted white-light-emitting diode (2pc-WLED). Therefore, the overall enhanced efficiency of PeQD-emissive LCDs was determined to be 4.28 times higher than that of a conventional 2pc-WLED-based CF-LCD. This color-by-blue core/shell PeQD-emissive LCD provides an excellent opportunity for the creation of new types of highly efficient LCDs.
Introduction
Recently, CdSe/ZnS and InP/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) have been applied in the QD-enhanced films (QDEFs) used in the white-by-blue backlight system of liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) to realize considerable improvements in several electro-optical characteristics of LCDs, in this case the color gamut, device efficiency, and dynamic range.1–6 These improvements were realized by synthesizing appropriate QD materials and fabricating an appropriate LCD device architecture in order to enhance the color quality and material stability of conventional QD-based LCDs. As a feasible QD material, perovskite quantum dots (PeQDs) were used instead of commercialized Cd-based and InP-based QDs.7–9 In this regard, as an efficient emissive LCD, a PeQD film pattern was structurally placed in the position of the color filter pattern in a LCD, not in the backlight position. In addition, the unique structure of light-recycling filters (LRFs) and a long-wavelength pass-dichroic filter (LPDF) sandwiched between PeQD films was introduced in an effort to improve the forward-emission efficiency and color purity level.
Many research groups have focused recently on fully inorganic cesium lead halide (CsPbX3) PeQDs owing to their strong light absorption, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), good wavelength tunability, and narrow FWHM.10–12 Depending on these optical properties, CsPbX3 PeQDs have been utilized in high-quality electro-optical applications such as solar cells, lasers, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as light harvesters and color convertors.13–18 Although a narrow FWHM (<30 nm) and a high PLQY (close to 100%) are comparable to those of CdSe-based and InP-based QDs,11–13 the intrinsic instability to both moisture and temperature of CsPbX3 PeQDs has remained a challenge to overcome. During the last five years, the optical properties and stability of PeQDs have been greatly enhanced via the successful compositional, crystal, ligand, and coating engineering of PeQDs and the optimization of the process of synthesizing QDs, as reported in many studies on the synthesis of high-efficiency PeQDs.19–27 Quite recently, G CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br5 core/shell QDs have been developed to enhance the stability of PeQDs for application in electro-optical devices.28,29
As shown in Fig. 1a–c, three types of device structures have been reported for QD-enhanced film (QDEF) LCDs: the on-edge, on-surface, and on-package types. The on-edge and on-surface types of QD-enhanced films are most commonly used in commercialized QDEF-assisted CF-LCDs owing to the lower level of thermal attack given the longer distances between the QD films and the LED chips as compared to the QDs in the on-package type of LED.30–32 As is well known,33 an increase in the distance between the QDs and the LED chip dramatically increases the thermal stability of the QDs, as QDs when closer to blue (B) LED chips are exposed to a higher junction temperature (∼150 °C) and a greater amount of light flux. Although a nearly 100% wide color gamut is achieved from narrow-bandwidth InP/ZnS QDEF-assisted LCDs,6 the inefficient basic LCD structure remains. This intrinsically inefficient LCD structure arises due to the employment of a color filter (CF) and a pair of polarizers in QDEF-assisted LCDs (Fig. 1a).34 Phosphor-filtered LCDs (or emissive LCDs), in which phosphor films are replaced with CFs,35,36 were initially suggested in the 1990s to increase the device efficiency of conventional CF-assisted LCDs (Fig. 1b). It is possible to employ near-UV/violet or B backlight as an excitation light source for the excitation of red, green, blue (RGB) or RG phosphors, respectively. Ideally, phosphor LCDs can provide some advantages over conventional CF-LCDs, such as an ideal threefold enhancement of the device efficiency given the removal of RGB CFs, faster response times of the B-color liquid crystal (LC) shutter with the elimination of the phase-retarding film, and more uniform emission due to the use of Lambertian-emitting phosphors. Nonetheless, to date phosphor LCDs have not replaced CF-assisted LCDs owing to several disadvantages, such as the cross-talk between RGB color subpixels, the backward loss of the phosphor emission, the scattering loss of micro-sized phosphors, the color mixing of the B backlight and the phosphor emission, and the limited color gamut of phosphor emissions with a broad bandwidth.5,37
 Fig. 1  Backlight illustrations of (a) a QDEF-assisted LCD, (b) a conventional CF-LCD with QD- or traditional phosphor-packaged LEDs, and (c) a color-by-blue PeQD-emissive LCD with a LRF and a LPDF. 
Although peripheral technologies continue to mature with the development of emissive LCDs, the most important issue to prevent the realization of QD-emissive LCDs is the discovery of appropriate RG QDs. Hence, we have attempted to develop efficient and stable InP/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs for application in QD-emissive LCDs.6 However, it remains highly challenging to synthesize RG InP/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs with a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) value less than 35 nm in an effort to enlarge the color gamut until it is larger than 100% of the color gamut as defined by the National Television Standard Committee (NTSC). This attainment of InP-based QDs is not yet met by the newly developed color standard of Rec.2020.6 Therefore, highly efficient and stable PeQDs may be feasible for use as narrower FWHM alternatives to improve the color gamut and efficiency of RG-emitting QD color converters in QD-emissive LCDs.
Fortunately, as previously reported, the development of peripheral technologies creates an environment in which emissive LCDs can be realized. First, the recent development of in-cell metal polarizers38–42 and efficient QD patterns can create subpixels of emissive LCDs without cross-talk.43 Second, the issue of backward emission loss has also been resolved due to the development of RG light-recycling filters (LRFs) (see Fig. 1c).44 As reported in our earlier research,45–47 LRFs were developed to recycle the backward emission of a QD or a phosphor layer used in color-by-blue display devices. Third, the development of LPDFs can solve the color mixing problem by blocking the B backlight.6,48–50 Fourth, the realization of scatter-free, nano-sized QD color converter layers can resolve the scattering loss problem associated with micro-sized phosphor layers.51 Hence, the full color-conversion potential of a CsPbX3-based PeQD-emissive LCD can be realized by reducing the cross-talk, backward emission loss, scattering loss, and color mixing with LRFs and LPDFs.
In this study, highly efficient and stable R CsPb(Br0.35I0.65)3/CsPb2Br5 core/shell as well as G CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br5 core/shell PeQDs are synthesized by optimizing the compositional elements and reaction parameters in a one-step hot injection process.28 These PeQDs can be utilized as color converters when they are integrated into the CF positions of conventional LCDs with a B LED pumping source to fabricate an efficient QD-emissive LCD architecture. Additionally, a blue-windowing and RG-mirroring LRF and a blue-mirroring and RG-windowing LPDF were implemented in the bottom and top positions, respectively, of the QD film of the PeQD-emissive LCDs to enhance the amount of light and the color purity of the front-emitting light.6,47–50 A test-bed PeQD-emissive LCD architecture was fabricated to compare the electro-optical properties of the RG PeQD-emissive LCDs. Thus, we analyzed the electro-optical performance capabilities of PeQD-emissive LCDs considering the enlarged RGB color gamut of the devices, the improved PL efficiency of the PeQD layer, and the enhanced B backlight efficiency. We also compared the total performance outcomes of the PeQD-emissive LCDs by considering the combination of the enhanced efficiency of RG color-converted PeQD films, the enhanced efficiency of a B LED backlight, and the enhanced color efficiency of the widened color gamut while varying core/shell PeQDs and PeQD films to evaluate the optical suitability of the core/shell PeQDs in QD-emissive LCDs. Finally, we improved the device efficiency of PeQD-emissive LCDs (4.28 times) compared to that of previously developed InP QD-emissive LCDs (2.42 times)6 and conventional 2-phosphor converted (pc)-WLED-based CF-LCDs (control device, 1.00 time).
Experimental section
1. Materials
The following materials and chemicals were purchased and used for the synthesis of PeQDs and films without further treatments: cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99.995%, Aldrich), lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.999%, Aldrich), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.999%, Aldrich), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%, Aldrich), oleylamine (OLA, 80–90%, Acros Organics), oleic acid (OA, 90%, Aldrich), and toluene (99.8%, Aldrich). InGaN blue LEDs (λmax = 445 nm) were purchased from Dongbu LED, Inc. and were used as an excitation source for the RG PeQDs. A UV-curable acrylate binder (NOA 63) was used to fabricate PeQD emissive-films.
2. Synthesis of PeQDs and free-standing QD-based films

2.1. Preparation of the Cs-oleate solution. 
Cs-oleate solution was prepared by placing a Cs source, 0.16 g of Cs2CO3, 6 mL of ODE, and 0.5 mL of OA in a 20 mL vial. This mixed solution was then capped with a rubber septum and then heated at 150 °C and purged in N2 gas to dissolve the Cs2CO3 powder completely.


2.2. Synthesis of RG core CsPbX3 PeQDs. 
To synthesize R CsPb(Br0.35I0.65)3 PeQDs, 5 mL of ODE, 0.066 mmol of PbBr2, and 0.122 mmol of PbI2 were placed into a 100 mL three-necked flask and degassed for 1 h at 120 °C. Similarly, to synthesize green CsPbBr3 PeQDs, 5 mL of ODE and 0.188 mmol of PbBr2 were placed into a 100 mL three-necked flask and degassed for 1 h at 120 °C. The ligands, in the case of OLA and OA, were injected into these flasks at 120 °C under an N2 atmosphere. After the PbX2 powder was completely dissolved in the reaction solution, the flask temperature was increased to 210 °C and 0.4 mL of the Cs-oleate solution was then injected into the reaction flask as quickly as possible. The temperature of the reaction flask was held constant (210 °C) for a very short time (5 s). The resultant crude RG PeQD solution was quenched in an ice-water bath and purified using a conventional centrifugation process, after which the purified RG PeQDs were dissolved and stored in toluene.


2.3. Synthesis of RG CsPbX3/CsPb2Br5 core/shell PeQDs. 
RG core/shell CsPbX3/CsPb2Br5 PeQDs were synthesized using a synthetic procedure similar to that used to produce CsPbX3 core PeQDs. The only differences are the concentration of the PbX2 solution and the reaction time. For the synthesis of RG core/shell CsPbX3/CsPb2Br5 PeQDs, 5 mL of ODE and 0.489 mmol PbBr2 for G CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br5, and 0.171 mmol of PbBr2 and 0.318 mmol of PbI2 for R CsPb(Br0.35I0.65)3/CsPb2Br5 were used instead of using the amount of PbX2 precursor for the core CsPbX3 PeQDs. The mixture of the dissolved PbX2 solution and the as-prepared Cs-oleate was heated to 210 °C for 10 min. The resultant crude CsPbX3/CsPb2Br5 QD solution was cooled in an ice-water bath and purified using the same purification method used to purify the core CsPbX3 PeQDs, i.e., a centrifugation process. Subsequently, the purified RG core/shell CsPbX3/CsPb2Br5 PeQDs were stored in toluene.


2.4. Fabrication of free-standing QD-based films6. 
RG core/shell CsPbX3/CsPb2Br5 PeQD-based films were fabricated by mixing a purified PeQD solution with 4 wt% of a NOA 63-toluene solution (the volume ratio of toluene to NOA is 0.27:1) in a glass or Al dish.49 Before mixing with the NOA-63 solution, the concentration of the RG PeQD-toluene solution was determined by preparing the samples at an optical density level of 1.5 for RG PeQDs at 515 nm and 635 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer. The mixed RG core/shell CsPbX3/CsPb2Br5 PeQD-NOA solution was then dried and the toluene was evaporated in a vacuum desiccator at ∼20 mTorr for 2 h. The body color of the resultant PeQD-NOA paste was then made to match that of the PeQD solutions. 600 μm-thick PeQD-NOA films were fabricated by printing and drying the PeQD-NOA paste onto a 600 μm spacer attached to a glass substrate. To polymerize the PeQD-NOA films, the dried PeQD-NOA films were then exposed to 365 nm of UV light for 30 min. Finally, four types of RG core and core/shell PeQD-NOA films were obtained by detaching the films from the spacer-attached glass substrate.

3. Characterization
The PL emission and UV-visible absorbance spectra of the colloidal PeQD solution and PeQD-NOA films were measured using a spectrophotometer (Darsa, PSI Trading Co., Ltd) equipped with a Xe lamp and a UV-visible spectrometer (Lambda 365, PerkinElmer), respectively. The quantum yields (QYs) of the PeQD solutions were measured and calculated by comparison with a commercial dye (coumarin 153). The detailed procedure used to determine the QYs when calculating in the RG PeQD solutions is available in the literature. The crystal structures of the RG core and core/shell PeQD powders were measured using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; Ultima IV, Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation. The lattice distance, crystal quality, morphology, and size of the core/shell PeQDs were analyzed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM; JEM-3010, JEOL, Ltd) at 300 kV. The composition of the PeQDs was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7401F, JEOL Ltd) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDX). The quantitative analysis of Cs and Pb components in the PeQDs was conducted by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, NexlON300, PerkinElmer). The CEs of the RG core and core/shell PeQD-emissive LCDs and the 2-pc-WLED-assisted CF-LCDs were measured using a spectrophotometer (Darsapro-5000, PSI Trading Co., Ltd) equipped with an integrated sphere.
The electro-optical properties of the RG core and core/shell PeQD-emissive LCDs and the 2-pc-WLED-assisted CF-LCDs were analyzed using a spectroradiometer (CS-2000, Konica Minolta, Japan) with a digital multimeter (Model 2001, Keithley Instruments Inc., USA). A B backlight or a 2-pc-WLED backlight was operated at an applied current of 60 mA to measure the elector-optical characteristics of the RG PeQD-emissive LCD and the conventional CF-LCD. The LC shutter of both the blue LC for the color-by-blue emissive-LCD and the white LC for the CF-LCD was operated using a 4 V power supply (236 source measurement unit, Keithley Instruments Inc., USA).
Results and discussion
Highly efficient and stable R-emitting CsPb(Br0.35I0.65)3/CsPb2Br5 core/shell PeQDs as well as G-emitting CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br5 core/shell PeQDs were synthesized by a one-step hot injection core/shell synthetic process. As shown in Fig. 2a–c, the optical properties of the G CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br5 and R CsPb(Br0.35I0.65)3/CsPb2Br5 core/shell PeQDs show that the peak wavelengths of the synthesized R-emitting CsPb(Br0.35I0.65)3/CsPb2Br5 PeQDs and G-emitting CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br5 PeQDs reach 509 and 628 nm, respectively, with corresponding FWHM values of 20 and 44 nm. The color-gamut figure also shows that purer color and a wide color gamut are achieved with narrower FWHM values of the PL emission of the RG PeQDs investigated here. The color gamut of the RG core/shell PeQDs and a B LED is 122.7% larger than that in the NTSC standard and fairly close to that of the Rec.2020 standard, which will be a new color regulation system for display devices in 2020. The color gamut of PeQDs produces a color reproduction area comparable to that of CdSe/ZnS QDs and is larger than those of InP/ZnS QD-based QDEF-assisted LCDs and QD-emissive LCDs.6,52 The PLQYs of the core and core/shell PeQDs in this study were measured and found to be 72.6 and 78.9% for G and 75.2 and 77.4% for R PeQDs, respectively, comparable to those of the core PeQDs synthesized previously by our group.49,50 The enhanced PLQYs of the shelled core of the PeQDs imply that the CsPb2Br5 shell effectively passivates and encapsulates the surface defect states on the surfaces of the CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.35I0.65)3 core PeQDs. As shown in Fig. 2b, the PL spectra of the core and core/shell indicate that some of the PL spectra became slightly blue-shifted (11 nm for R, 6 nm for G) after the shelling of the core PeQDs (Table S1, ESI†). That is, through the shelling process of the CsPb2Br5 on the CsPbX3 core, it appears that the size of the core is slightly reduced due to the etching on the core surface in the form of the CsPb2Br5 shelling protection. The slightly blue-shifted PL spectra of the RG core/shell PeQDs can indicate that the band gaps of the RG core/shell PeQDs become larger than those of the core PeQDs due to the quantum size effect.53 Therefore, we selected the highest PLQY of the RG PeQDs among the RG core/shell PeQDs while minimally shifting the peak positions of the QD cores after shelling. The PL properties pertaining to the core/shell PeQDs indicate that the synthesized RG-emitting core/shell PeQDs show appropriate RG wavelengths, pure color coordinates, and narrow FWHMs, as well as high PLQYs for application in PeQD-emissive LCDs with a wide color gamut.

(l) The overall XRD survey of the core and core/shell RG PeQDs. Highly magnified XRD data of (m) G core/shell and (n) R core/shell PeQDs. The inverted triangles in green and navy blue indicate the cubic CsPbBr3 (ref. code: 01-075-0412) and tetragonal CsPb2Br5 (ref. code: 00-025-0211) reference position, respectively. The insets in (m) and (n) are actual pictures of the core/shell G and R PeQD powders, respectively. 
The sizes of the RG-emitting core/shell as well as the core PeQDs in this study are such that the narrow FWHM of the RG-emitting peaks is maintained, as shown in the TEM images in Fig. 2d–g. These figures also show that both the RG core/shell PeQDs are distributed with a reasonable size distribution (Fig. S1, ESI†), consistent with previous reports. Furthermore, the TEM images of the PeQD shape and the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) simulated patterns (Fig. S2, ESI†) of the surface lattice directly confirm that the crystal structure of both the core and RG core/shell PeQDs can be indexed to the cubic phase of CsPbBr3. As in a previous report, the CsPb2Br5 shell layer indicates a lattice spacing of ∼0.30 nm (213) of the tetragonal phase while the CsPbBr3 core indicates a lattice spacing of ∼0.42 nm (110) of the cubic phase, as presented in Fig. 2h–k. The results of the TEM analysis suggest that the CsPb2Br5 shelling process only covers the surface of the CsPbBr3 core with several layers without changing the cubic structure or shape of the RG core PeQDs.28
As shown in Fig. 2l–n, the XRD results indicate that both the core and RG core/shell PeQDs can be indexed to the cubic phase of CsPb(Br0.35I0.65)3 and CsPbBr3 as the core (olive-color triangle) and the tetragonal phase of CsPb2Br5 (navy blue-color triangles) as the shell. The presence of the tetragonal peaks of CsPb2Br5 indirectly confirms that the CsPb2Br5 shell is coated onto the surface of the PeQD core QDs owing to the one-step heating process of core/shell growth, as previously reported.28 The XRD peaks also indicate that the diffraction peaks of the R PeQDs shift to a lower 2θ angle owing to the larger cell parameter of the R PeQDs as compared to the G PeQDs. That is, the I-containing R core and core/shell PeQDs are maintained at the peak positions of the CsPbBr3 cubic phase with a slight peak shift. In many previous studies, the most common shape of CsPbBrxI3−x PeQDs was the cubic shape, even in I-containing solid solutions such as red emissive PeQDs as the cubic phase of CsPbBr3 grows with a minimal system energy and because the I elements are inserted into halide sites.11,54,55 The slight peak shift can be explained by Vegard's law, which holds that the lattice parameters of an alloyed mixture of two constituents are identical to a rule of mixtures of the two components.11 EDX and ICP-MS surveys also support the formation of core/shell PeQDs. Fig. S3a and b (ESI†) show the composition ratio of the RG core PeQD; the Cs:Pb:X ratios in the RG PeQDs are 1:1.05:3.30 and 1:1.02:2.99 (1.07 for Br, 1.92 for I), respectively, indicating that each element in CsPbX3 can be identified as having a suitable value for stoichiometry. Similarly, for the RG core/shell PeQD, the corresponding Cs:Pb:X ratios are 1:1.44:4.38 and 1:1.22:3.74 (Fig. S3c and d, ESI†). The obtained ICP-MS results show that the molar ratio of Cs to Pb of the RG core PeQD is close to 1:1, while that of the RG core/shell PeQDs was found to be 1:1.2 with more of the Pb component (Fig. S3e, ESI†). These EDX and ICP-MS compositional values of RG CsPbX3/CsPb2X5 PeQDs are confirmed with the mixed or double-layered phases of CsPbX3 and CsPb2X5 as having acceptable values.
We used a polyurethane-based photopolymer (NOA 63) to fabricate RG PeQD dispersed films for the color-conversion layer of the PeQD-emissive LCD, as the NOA polymer is an appropriate binder material which effectively dissolves OLA/OA-capped PeQDs. The core and core/shell PeQDs can be stable in the NOA 63 polymer binder even if the functional groups of the NOA 63 binder are mostly matched with those of polyurethane, which contains carboxyl and amine groups (see Fig. S4, ESI†). It was noted that the passivation process to improve the stability of the surface of the PeQD proceeded from the functional groups in NOA as a ‘Lewis base’ compound.56–58
As previously reported, a high PeQD concentration level was loaded onto the NOA films after a simple photo-polymerization process. The core and core/shell PeQD-NOA free-standing films were fabricated by a vacuum-drying and UV-curing process, as shown in Fig. S5a (ESI†). The fabricated core/shell PeQD-NOA nano-hybrid films allow the realization of color converting films for a PeQD-emissive LCD with excellent PL efficiency and high brightness. Fig. 3a shows that the PL peaks of the core/shell PeQD-NOA films are less shifted from the PL peaks of the RG PeQD solutions than those of the core PeQD-NOA films due to the more agglomerated core PeQDs in the films (8 nm for the G core, 9 nm for the G core/shell, 4 nm for the R core, and 10 nm for the R core/shell). The CIE color coordinates in Fig. 3b show that the RG-emitting PeQD films under 450 nm monochromatic excitation light and a B LED cover 134.6% of the NTSC standard. Although the peak wavelengths are slightly blue-shifted in the RG-emitting core/shell PeQD-NOA films, the RGB color gamut becomes wider than that of the Rec.2020 standard as well as the NTSC RGB triangle area. As indicated in Table S1 (ESI†), the shelling process improves the PLQYs of the RG core PeQDs by ∼8.7% and ∼2.9% for the two types. The enhanced PLQY as a result of the shelling and ligand process is due to the more effective passivation of the surface defects as compared to that by only a ligand process. The enhancement of the relative PLQY of the RG core/shell film from the core PeQD films was measured and found to exceed ∼20% and ∼11% for the two types (see Fig. 3c), indicating that the core/shell PeQDs are more durable against the degradation effects caused by the filming process. The meaningful difference in the QY enhancement between the core/shell PeQD colloidal solutions and the core/shell PeQD-NOA films can result from the CsPb2Br5 protective coating against chemical and oxidative attacks which arise during the filming process and from the environment. A small PL drop of PeQDs after the filming process is required to apply RG PeQDs to patterned pixels for color-by-blue displays. The shell coating of the stable CsPb2Br5 perovskite nanolayer can serve as one of the basic components to ensure minimal loss of the PLQY of the core PeQDs during the filming process.28

The arrows in figures (a) and (b) indicate the spectra and color coordinate shift, respectively, from the core PeQD films to the core/shell PeQD films. The color coordinate of Rec.2020 is shown for comparison with the RG PeQDs. The green and red arrows in figure (c) denote the increased relative intensities. The stability results of the core and core/shell RG PeQD films under (d) UV exposure (10 days) and in (e) water-immersion (10 days) and under (f) thermal conditions at 100 °C under a RH 33% ambient condition. 
Stability issues against UV irradiation, moisture, oxygen and thermal treatments are crucial with regard to the use of RG PeQD-NOA films in actual PeQD-LCDs. Fig. 3d and e show the greater declines in the PL intensity drops of the RG core PeQD films, which were found to be ∼87 and 33% and ∼80 and 35% relative to those of pristine core RG PeQD films under UV irradiation and water dipping after ten days, respectively, compared to the small PLQY drop of the RG core/shell PeQD film. The low UV and good water stability characteristics of the RG core PeQD films stem from the intrinsic properties of the inorganic RG CsPb(Br0.35I0.65)3 and CsPbBr3 PeQDs, which are susceptible to UV and water, respectively. This weak stability of the inorganic RG core PeQDs has been reported in many publications focusing on the instability issues of thin films, powders and solutions.21,28 As expected, the developed R CsPb(Br0.35I0.65)3/CsPb2Br5 and G CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br5 core/shell PeQD films showed superior UV and water stability properties compared to the core PeQD films. After ten days of UV irradiation and water dipping, these samples retained more than 93 and 90 and 94 and 88% of the initial intensity levels of the PL peaks of the RG core/shell PeQDs, respectively (Fig. 3d and e).
During the temperature stability tests, the PL intensity levels of both the RG core and core/shell PeQDs were measured as a function of time up to 24 hours at 100 °C under a RH 33% ambient condition. As is well known, this type of temperature stability test can confirm that the optical properties of the RG core PeQDs decrease significantly above 100 °C.26,49 Similarly, Fig. 3f shows that the PL intensity values of the RG core PeQDs decreased to 11% and 10%, respectively, of those of the pristine core RG PeQD films after a heat treatment lasting 24 hours at 100 °C. Otherwise, the PL intensity of the RG core/shell PeQD films decreases much more slowly compared to those of the RG core PeQDs. This figure also shows that the levels of the RG core/shell PeQDs were decreased to approximately 42% and 25% of those of the pristine RG core/shell PeQD films. Specifically, we conducted thermal recovery experiments at applied temperatures of 20 °C and 100 °C each for an exposure time of one hour (see Fig. S6, ESI†). The PL results of the green and red core and the core/shell PeQD films show reversible PL recovery from a heating temperature of 100 °C to a cooling temperature of 20 °C. In the thermal recovery results during the seventh step, the PL intensities of the green and red core PeQDs (CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br0.35I0.65)3) were found to be 41.8% and 21.1%, respectively. This considerable PL loss indicates an irreversible phenomenon at 373 K. In the same manner, the PL intensities of the green and red core/shell PeQDs (CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br5 and CsPbBr(Br0.35I0.65)3/CsPb2Br5) remained at 71.6% and 51.1%, respectively. Therefore, all of the improved stability characteristics of the core/shell PeQDs against UV, water, and temperature extremes can help during the fabrication of efficient PeQD films for application in color-conversion layers to create efficient RG colors excited by B LEDs.
In this study, a basic color-by-blue structure was used to assess the suitability of the application of PeQD-NOA films to emissive LCDs, as shown in Fig. 1c. The total improvement in the device efficiency of the PeQD-emissive LCDs is determined by multiplying three factors while the RG colors are fully converted by a B LED; there are the enhanced conversion efficiency (CE) of the LRF/LPDF-sandwiched RG core/shell PeQD films, the enhanced forward emission of the blue backlight system, and the enhanced efficiency from the enlarged color gamut. A LRF was placed on the backside of the core/shell PeQD-emissive films to recycle the backward emission of the PeQD films (Fig. S5b–e, ESI†). A LPDF was placed on the front side of the core/shell PeQD-emissive films to rule out any mixed B backlight emission from the RG PeQD emission. As previously reported,49 a LRF and a LPDF with corresponding peak positions of 515 nm and 480 nm can be utilized as standard filter structures to compare the optical properties of plain PeQD films, LRF-assisted PeQD films, and LRF/LPDF-sandwiched PeQD films. The reflectance spectra of the standard LRF and LPDF are compared as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). After optimizing the PeQD concentration in the NOA films, the relative spectra were compared at the highest intensities, as shown in Fig. 4a and d. The relative intensities of the LRF/LPDF-sandwiched RG core/shell PeQD-NOA films were enhanced by 1.33 and 1.20 times compared to those of the plain RG core/shell PeQD films (Fig. 4c and f). The major enhancement of the forward emission is due to the reflecting effect of the backside emission of the RG PeQD films by the LRF. Fig. 4b and e show that pure RG color coordinates are obtained from LPDF-capped core/shell PeQD films. The enhanced color purities and enlarged color gamut of the RG core/shell PeQDs films originate from the filtering effect of the mixed B emission from the RG emitting area by the LPDF.

Similarly, the optical properties of three types of R PeQD LEDs, the (d) emission spectra, (e) relative intensity, FWHM, and (f) CIE color coordinates are shown. The insets in figures (c) and (f) present actual emission images of a B LED and three types of PeQD LEDs. 

Fig. 5a and b show the fully color-converted RG core/shell PeQD spectra, the color coordinates of the best LRF/LPDF-sandwiched core/shell PeQD films, and their RGB color gamut. These figures confirm the mixed effects of the LRF/LPDF sandwich structure, including the LRF-light recycling properties and the LPDF-color filtering properties.6,45,46 The LRF/LPDF sandwiched films attain higher PL CE values as well as purer RG color and a wider color gamut with almost no shifting of the peak wavelength (∼1 nm shifting) or widening of the FWHM of the RG PeQD peaks (∼less than 1 nm broadening). Therefore, the enhanced PL emission and the wide color gamut confirm that the introduction of both a LRF and a LPDF can lead to an efficient and more colorful PeQD-emissive LCD architecture with RG core/shell PeQD films.

As previously reported in our earlier publication,6 we prepared two devices that employ identical B LEDs as a B light source of blue subpixel and excitation light for RG phosphors in a 2-pc-WLED backlight system and a RG core/shell PeQD-emissive LCD for comparison. A conventional CF-LCD is equipped with a 2-pc-WLED with R (K2SiF6:Mn, λmax = 632 nm) and G (β-SiAlON:Eu, λmax = 535 nm) phosphors. The optical performances of the two device structures displayed in Fig. 1b and c were compared to investigate the enhancement effect of pure RGB color resulting from the RG PeQD emission and B transmission passing through the LC shutter in the core/shell PeQD-emissive LCD prototype. Fig. S8 and S9 (ESI†) compare the RGB emission spectra, their color coordinates, and the color gamut of the conventional 2pc-WLED backlight CF-LCDs and PeQD-emissive LCDs. The fully converted RG PeQD emissions provide RG colors of much higher quality levels compared to the RG emission from the conventional RG phosphors.
The first advantage of the PeQD-emissive color-by-blue LCD device is that it has a higher system efficiency of the B backlight passing through a LC shutter than that of the white backlight of 2-pc-WLEDs. As previously reported, the magnitude of the blue light which is transmitted via the LC-shutter for PeQD-emissive LCDs is 1.27 higher than that of the white light for 2-pc-WLED-assisted CF-LCDs. The higher efficiency of the blue backlight system is due to the removal of phase-retardation films in the RGB LC-shutter system and the packaging loss of the backlight system in the 2-pc-WLED-assisted CF-LCD. In a 2-pc-WLED backlight, RG phosphors in the LED package partially lose their conversion light from the B LED when it is transferred to produce white color. The energy loss of the 2-pc-WLED is due to multiple complex causes related to energy-loss mechanisms of the phosphor paste, scattering loss caused by micro-sized particles, the lower internal quantum efficiency (IQE) due to the imperfect crystallinity, energy transfer loss by defects,45 and packaging losses by the packaging process and materials, although there are some differences in the degrees of magnitude.
Subsequently, we compared the color conversion efficiency of LRF/LPDF-sandwiched RG core/shell PeQD films excited by an efficient B-backlight system and the transmission efficiency through RG color filters from a LC shutter on a 2-pc-WLED, as described in Fig. 1b and c. As shown in Table 1, the optical performances of the LRF/LPDF-sandwiched RG core/shell PeQDs are compared to those of the RGB CF-assisted LCDs (Fig. S5e, ESI†). It is clearly observed that the measured CE values of the LRF/LPDF-sandwiched RG core/shell PeQD films in the PeQD-emissive LCD are 44.3% and 42.0% compared to the values of 36.3% and 35.4% of the RG core films in the PeQD-emissive LCD, confirming the more effective core/shell QDs used in the color-conversion system. These values were also compared with the values of RG light transmitted through color filters on LC shutters from a conventional 2-pc-WLED backlight system. In a color-by-blue core/shell PeQD-emissive LCD, it is assumed by comparison that the B efficiency transmitted through the LC shutter is nearly 100% as that of the standard B-subpixel light. Therefore, the relative efficiency values of light transmitted through the R, G, and B-color filter on the LC shutter in a 2pc-WLED-assisted CF-LCD were measured and found to be 24.5, 36.2, and 35.5%, respectively, compared to that of a white backlight. Finally, the total conversion efficiency of the RGB color-by-blue core/shell PeQD-emissive LCD is approximately 186.3% for the PeQD films compared to that (96.2% (36.2 + 35.5 + 24.5)) of the filtered backlight for a 2-pc-WLED-assisted CF-LCD. Although the individual RGB efficiency values differ greatly in the equally sized RGB subpixels of the core/shell PeQD-emissive LCD, the asymmetrically sized RGB subpixels can be designed to create balanced white light from all RGB light from the RGB subpixels in the core/shell PeQD-emissive LCDs (see Fig. S10, ESI†). As previously reported, the total external efficiency of the summed RGB light from the RGB subpixels is thought to be one of the most critical standards when evaluating the possibility of realizing core/shell PeQD-emissive LCDs. It can be clearly confirmed that the CE of a PeQD-emissive LCD is 1.94 times higher than that of a 2-pc-WLED-assisted CF-LCD.

Next, it was necessary to convert the enlarged color gamut of both devices to the enhanced CE following reported principles. The two devices are a color-by-blue core/shell PeQD-emissive LCD and a CF-LCD with a 2-pc-WLED. Accordingly, the obtained color gamuts of the PeQD-emissive LCD and a conventional CF-LCD with a 2-pc-WLED backlight were measured and found to be ∼134.2% and ∼90.2% of the NTSC standard triangle, respectively. This color gamut is comparable to that of a B LED and CdSe-based RG films of QDEFs for LCDs as reported in several publications.48 As shown in Table 2, the slight variations of the color gamut and the FWHM of each film stacking structure are due to the small fluctuations of the filming process and the filtering effect of the device architecture.49 As reported in relation to the Helmholtz–Kohlrausch (H–K) effect59–61 and our previously reported InP-based QD-emissive LCD, the wider color gamut leads to lower power consumption and more vivid color in full-color display devices. It was reported that we can perceive the purer color of the screen image as a brighter display by the eye.6,59–61 The perceived quality metric (PQM) was used as a conversion tool from the color gamut to the color efficiency to define the screen quality quantitatively, as shown in Fig. 6a and as reported in our previous publication.6 Moreover, this figure shows the relationship between the brightness and the color gamut. It also converts the color gamut into the brightness (cd m−2). As previously reported, the isoquality line corresponds to an equal level of the optical quality, and the lines in the higher corner on the right are defined as having a higher perceived optical quantity. This figure also shows that the points on the isoquality lines correspond to the Adobe color gamut in the CIE 1976 color coordinate. To analyze the enhanced efficiency from the enhanced color gamut, we compared the color gamut and efficiency of both the RG core/shell PeQD-emissive LCD and the 2-pc-WLED-assisted CF-LCD. As noted above, the color gamut of the RG core/shell PeQD-emissive LCD (134.2%) is much wider than that of the 2-pc-WLED-assisted CF-LCD (90.2%). When calculating the perceived image quality, the RG PeQD-emissive LCD would be 1.74 times more efficient than the 2-pc-WLED-assisted CF-LCD (174 cd m−2vs. 302 cd m−2). Hence, to obtain the same level of light efficiency, the core/shell PeQD-emissive LCD appears to be much more efficient than a conventional 2-pc-WLED-assisted CF-LCD. This clearly indicates that the core/shell PeQD-emissive LCD operates much more efficiently than a conventional 2-pc-WLED-assisted CF-LCD due to the greater sensitivity of the eyes to more saturated and purer colors.

Conclusions
To commercialize the QD-emissive LCD approach, the widely studied PeQD material requires improvements in the PL efficiency and material stability. Moreover, fabrication issues including a photo-patternable RG PeQD process, mixed color by cross-talk, and the backward loss of isotropic emission should be addressed before PeQD-emissive LCDs can be realized. Nonetheless, the achievement of the PeQD-emissive LCD approach can provide significant benefits, such as enhanced device efficiency and a widened color gamut.
To improve the suitability of PeQDs for application in emissive LCDs, highly efficient and stable R CsPb(Br0.35I0.65)3/CsPb2Br5 and G CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br5 core/shell PeQDs were synthesized by a one-step hot-injection process with excess PbBr2. Enhanced PLQYs and a greater stability of the R CsPb(Br0.35I0.65)3/CsPb2Br5 and G CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br5 core/shell PeQDs were attained by the surface passivation and encapsulation effects of the CsPb2Br5 shell. Both of the RG core/shell PeQD films developed here were deemed to be suitable RG nominees for realizing PeQD-emissive LCDs after analyzing the optical properties of RG PeQDs in a PeQD-emissive LCD and RG phosphors in a 2-pc-WLED backlight LCD. The relative CE level of a PeQD emissive LCD is 1.94 times greater than that of the 2-pc-WLED backlight LCD in a conventional RGB CF-LCD. The color gamut of a RG core/shell PeQD emissive LCD covers 134.2% of the NTSC standard. Therefore, the total device efficiency of the core/shell PeQD-emissive LCD is improved by the enhanced CE of the LRF and LPDF-sandwiched core/shell PeQD film, the improved efficiency of the B LED backlight system, and the enhanced perception efficiency of the widened color gamut of the RG core/shell PeQDs and the B LED.

Fig. 6b shows that the introduction of core/shell PeQD emissive materials and the replacement of PeQD films with RGB color filters confirm the considerable enhancement in the device efficiency of the PeQD-emissive LCD, obtaining a value 4.28 times higher than that of a 2-pc-WLED backlight LCD in CF-assisted LCDs. Moreover, this figure confirms that the relative device efficiency of the PeQD-emissive LCD is 1.77 times higher than that of our InP-based QD-emissive LCD. Therefore, the significant enhancement of the device efficiency of the color-by-blue core/shell PeQD-emissive LCD can lead to the replacement of RG PeQD patterned films and the B LED backlight system for RGB-patterned CFs and white backlight systems in the conventional 2-pc-WLED-assisted LCDs used in conventional CF-assisted LCDs.

 	Fig. 1  Backlight illustrations of (a) a QDEF-assisted LCD, (b) a conventional CF-LCD with QD- or traditional phosphor-packaged LEDs, and (c) a color-by-blue PeQD-emissive LCD with a LRF and a LPDF.	 

 	Fig. 2  Optical properties of (a) the absorption spectra, (b) PL spectra, and (c) CIE color coordinates of colloidal core (C) and core/shell (C/S) RG PeQDs. The color coordinate of Rec.2020 is shown for comparison with the RG PeQDs. Insets in Fig. 2(b) are actual emissive images of each PeQD. Low-magnification HR-TEM images of (d) core, (e) core/shell G PeQDs, and (f) core, (g) core/shell R PeQDs. The white bars indicate the 10 nm scale used. High-magnification images of (h) core, (i) core/shell G PeQDs, and (j) core, and (k) core/shell R PeQDs. The white bars indicate the 2 nm scale used. (l) The overall XRD survey of the core and core/shell RG PeQDs. Highly magnified XRD data of (m) G core/shell and (n) R core/shell PeQDs. The inverted triangles in green and navy blue indicate the cubic CsPbBr3 (ref. code: 01-075-0412) and tetragonal CsPb2Br5 (ref. code: 00-025-0211) reference position, respectively. The insets in (m) and (n) are actual pictures of the core/shell G and R PeQD powders, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  Optical properties of (a) PL spectra, (b) CIE color coordinates, and (c) relative PL spectra of the RG core (C) and core/shell (C/S) PeQD films. The arrows in figures (a) and (b) indicate the spectra and color coordinate shift, respectively, from the core PeQD films to the core/shell PeQD films. The color coordinate of Rec.2020 is shown for comparison with the RG PeQDs. The green and red arrows in figure (c) denote the increased relative intensities. The stability results of the core and core/shell RG PeQD films under (d) UV exposure (10 days) and in (e) water-immersion (10 days) and under (f) thermal conditions at 100 °C under a RH 33% ambient condition.	 

 	Fig. 4  Optical properties of three types of G PeQD LEDs: (a) emission spectra, (b) relative intensity, FWHM, and (c) CIE color coordinates. Similarly, the optical properties of three types of R PeQD LEDs, the (d) emission spectra, (e) relative intensity, FWHM, and (f) CIE color coordinates are shown. The insets in figures (c) and (f) present actual emission images of a B LED and three types of PeQD LEDs.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) PL spectra and (b) CIE color coordinates of a B LED and LRF/LPDF sandwiched RG PeQD films. (c) PL spectra and (d) CIE color coordinates of the RGB emission through a CF-assisted WLED. Each CIE color coordinate represents the color coordinates of Rec.2020 and NTSC standards for comparison with the RG PeQD LEDs.
