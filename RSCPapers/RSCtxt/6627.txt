, Accepted 17th October 2016First published on 18th October 2016AbstractSnO2-coated polypyrrole (PPy) with a three-dimensional (3-D) structured nanotube network has been prepared via a facile hydrothermal method and tested as an anode material for Na-ion batteries. The crystalline SnO2 nanoparticles (less than 25 nm in size) are distributed uniformly on the surfaces of the PPy tubes. When it is used as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the composite electrode can deliver a good reversible capacity of nearly 288 mA h g−1 when discharging at 100 mA g−1, with more than 69.1% capacity retention and stable coulombic efficiency of 99.6% after 150 cycles. The good electrochemical performance compared to the 151 mA h g−1 achieved by bare SnO2, which was fabricated by the same method in the absence of PPy, could be mainly attributed to the good dispersion of SnO2 on the 3-D matrix of PPy tubes, which facilitates the diffusion of Na+ ions and buffers the large volumetric changes during charge/discharge. Our results suggest that such SnO2/carbonaceous composites would be good anode candidates for SIBs.
Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been receiving tremendous attention as promising energy-storage and transformation devices, and they are widely applied in portable electronic devices, electric vehicles, hybrid electrical vehicles, etc. Now, they are becoming indispensable energy storage devices for application in the energy conversion of intermittent energy sources, such as in solar cell arrays and wind power stations. Considering these factors along with the limited reserves and non-uniform distribution of lithium resources, the big challenges for long-run and large-scale applications of lithium-ion batteries related to their availability and cost are becoming more and more prominent. Based on the above issues, it is an urgent necessity to develop new types of batteries. Over the past several years, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), which are becoming known as future alternatives to lithium ion batteries, have been attracting great attention,1,2 mainly in view of the abundance of sodium resources and their obvious cost-effective advantages.3–9 As is well known, it is still a big challenge to develop suitable anode materials for Na-ion batteries because of the larger ionic radius of Na+ compared to that of Li+, which causes greater volume changes during cycling and lower gravimetric and volumetric energy densities. These innate characteristics are directly limiting the feasibility of insertion materials for SIBs, including some cathode and anode materials. To bypass these deficiencies, many carbon-based materials have been extensively investigated, such as hard carbons, which can achieve reversible capacities from 200 to 290 mA h g−1 for more than 180 and 100 cycles, respectively.10,11 Reduced graphene oxide, could achieve a reversible capacity of 174.3 mA h g−1 over 250 cycles.12 N-Doped carbon composite, which showed a reversible capacity of 155.2 mA h g−1 after 260 cycles,13 retained a reversible capacity of 243 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles,14 and achieved a specific capacity of 175 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles etc.15 Some non-carbonaceous materials such as metal oxide materials also have been studied for SIBs.16–20 Among these materials, SnO2-based materials have attracted more interest because SnO2 can deliver high specific capacities by acting as an alloying material to store Na. It has been demonstrated that SnO2 can be an attractive anode for SIBs, with a capacity of 667 mA h g−1, based on the following reactions: 
4SnO2 + 16Na+ + 16e− → 4Sn + 8Na2O
(1) 
4Sn + 15Na+ + 16e− ↔ Na15Sn4 (ref. 20)
(2)
Similarly, the main disadvantages of SnO2 are the expansion and shrinkage of the active material particles during Na insertion/extraction, leading to particle pulverization/exfoliation and rapidly decreasing capacity in these materials.5,20 On the other hand, studies have shown that the diffusion speed of Na+ is 30 times slower than that of Li+ in SnO2 particles.21 Much research has been carried out to solve this problem, such as by decreasing the particle size of the active material to the nanoscale22 and loading some materials as buffer layers.20,23–29 In recent years, with the persistent efforts focused on exploring new anode materials for sodium storage, some three-dimensional (3-D) structured composites have been recognised to have sodium storage capability. There are many reports of SnO2 nanoparticles loaded onto graphene,25 anchored on reduced graphene oxide frameworks30 and confined in mesoporous carbon.31
Polypyrrole (PPy), in particular consisting of tubes with a 3-D structure, as a kind of conducting polymer, not only acts as an electrically conducting agent, which is beneficial for reducing resistance and enhancing the rate capability of the cell, but also as a matrix or binder, which can provide efficient transport pathways for electrons and mitigate the pulverization of the electrode brought about by the huge volume expansion during the charging/discharging process. This unique hierarchical structure not only provides good structural robustness and short ion/electron diffusion pathways, but also promotes the diffusion of the electrolyte into the inner spaces of the material, as well as providing sufficient open channels for fast Na+ migration. There are many reports on using PPy as a matrix to synthesize SnO2 based composites32–36 for anode materials. Recently, Du and Wang reported the synthesis of SnO2@polypyrrole nanotubes with microwave-assisted method.37 The pyrolyzed composite displayed very excellent capability for Li-storage as the PPy NTs can accommodate large volume change of the electrode material during Li+ insertion/extraction, which prevented SnO2 nanoparticles from pulverizing and electrical isolating during cycling. Combining PPy tubes with SnO2 nanoparticles to fabricate SnO2-based anode material in SIBs has not been explored, however. In term of the above advantages, we also adopted PPy as the substrate material and anchored the active SnO2 nanoparticles on its' surface.
Herein, we report the in situ hydrothermal synthesis of SnO2–PPy nanotubes with a 3-D structure. In the composites, SnO2 nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed on the surfaces of the PPy nanotubes. This unique hierarchical structure not only provides good structural robustness and short ion/electron diffusion pathways, but also has benefits for electrolyte penetration and Na+ transport. The obtained 3-D structured SnO2–PPy nanotube network showed a good reversible capacity of nearly 288 mA h g−1 when discharging at 100 mA g−1, with more than 69.1% capacity retention and stable coulombic efficiency of 99.6% over 150 cycles. Good rate capability is observed, based on current rate variation during cycling from 50 mA g−1 to 1 A g−1.
Experimental section
Synthesis of PPy tubes
The PPy tubes were synthesized according to a previous report38 with some modifications. The process of synthesis was as follows: 1.95 g of FeCl3 was added to 150 mL a solution containing 98 mg methyl orange (MO) in deionized water under constant stirring. A flocculent precipitate appeared immediately. Then, 0.484 g (0.5 mL) of pyrrole monomer was added into the mixture and the mixture was continuously stirred for 24 hours at room temperature. After that, the thus-formed PPy precipitate was washed several times with deionized water/ethanol, until the filtrate was colourless and neutral. Finally, the precipitate was dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h.
Preparation of the SnO2@PPy nanocomposites
In a typical procedure, 0.035 g hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) and 0.02 g urea were dissolved in 30 mL ethanol, and then 0.1 g PPy was dispersed into the foregoing solution by ultrasonic treatment for 0.5 h. 0.1 g of SnCl2·2H2O was added to the preceding mixture and stirred in for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the resulting blend was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated up to 120 °C for 10 h. When the precipitates were cooled down to room temperature naturally, then washed it with distilled water and ethanol for several times. Drying the precipitates in a vacuum oven overnight at 60 °C, the final product (denoted as SnO2–PPy-1) was obtained. SnO2–PPy-2 was obtained by adjusting the weight of SnCl2·2H2O to 0.15 g. For comparison, pure SnO2 nanoparticles were prepared with the same conditions without the addition of PPy.
Materials characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD; GBC MMA diffractometer) equipped with Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 2° min−1 was used to identify the structures of the as-prepared SnO2–PPy composites and the precursors. The weight ratio between SnO2 and PPy was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using a Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC1 between 40 °C and 800 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in air. The valence state of Sn was evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a SPECS PHOIBOS 100 Analyzer equipped with a high-vacuum chamber with base pressure below 10−8 mbar, with the X-ray excitation generated by Al Kα radiation at the high voltage of 12 kV and power of 120 W. The data were analyzed with the Casa XPS 2.3.15 software package. All the spectra were calibrated by C1s = 284.6 eV. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JEOL JSM-7500FA) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM; JEOL JSM-2010) were used to investigate the morphology of the samples.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performance testing was carried out via 2032-type coin cells. The working electrode was prepared by preparing a slurry in the mass ratio of 80 wt% active material, 10 wt% Super-P (carbon black) and 10 wt% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder, and coating it on copper foil substrate. Then the electrode film was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. An electrolyte with 1.0 mol L−1 NaClO4 in an ethylene carbonate (EC)–diethyl carbonate (DEC) solution (1:1 v/v), with 5 wt% addition of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), was used in this work. All the cells were assembled in a glove box filled with argon gas and measured at room temperature. Galvanostatic charge–discharge testing was carried out on a Land Test System with a cut-off voltage range from 0.01 to 1.5 V (vs. Na/Na+) at different current densities. The capacities are calculated based on the weight of the composites. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance measurements were conducted using a Biologic VMP-3 electrochemical workstation from 0.005 V to 2.5 V (vs. Na/Na+) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the PPy, SnO2 particles, and the SnO2–PPy-1 and SnO2–PPy-2 composites are displayed in Fig. 1a. The PPy spectrum reveals a clear broad peak at about 23.8° corresponding to its' amorphous nature, which is due to the scattering from PPy chains at the interplanar spacing.39–41 The XRD pattern of the SnO2 nanoparticles was characterized by several peaks which could be ascribed to the tetragonal SnO2 structure (cassiterite, PDF no. 01-0625) without any impurity. These large peaks clearly demonstrated the formation of small SnO2 particles with a nanocrystalline nature. From the XRD patterns of the obtained SnO2–PPy-1 and SnO2–PPy-2 composites, we find very similar broad peaks that could also be indexed to the tetragonal SnO2 structure (cassiterite, PDF no. 01-0625). No other characteristic peaks can be seen, suggesting that the SnO2 nanoparticles have covered the surfaces of the PPy.

For quantifying the amount of PPy in the SnO2–PPy composites, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were carried out in air. The TGA curves of pure PPy and its composites are shown in Fig. 1b. It can also be seen that both pure PPy and its composites show weight loss in the temperature range of 250–650 °C, which is in accordance with the oxidation of PPy, although the temperatures at which weight loss ends in the three samples have some differences. For pure PPy and SnO2–PPy-1, there was no difference. SnO2–PPy-2 required a higher temperature to oxidize PPy compared to pure PPy. This phenomenon could be the result of the greater amount of SnO2 loaded onto the PPy, which delayed the PPy oxidation process. After the initial oxidation of PPy, no further weight change was observed in the composites. Therefore, the weight change due to the oxidation of PPy can be directly converted into the amount of PPy in the SnO2–PPy composites. Using this approach, we calculated that the amounts of PPy in the SnO2–PPy-1 and SnO2–PPy-2 composites were 61.4 wt% and, 38.4 wt%, respectively.
The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of bare SnO2, PPy, SnO2–PPy-1, and SnO2–PPy-2 are shown in Fig. 1c. In the spectrum for SnO2, a strong vibration around 609 cm−1 is observed in the low wave number range, which is indexed to the antisymmetric Sn–O–Sn mode of tin oxide. In the spectrum for PPy, the band centered at 1560 cm−1 corresponds to typical CC in plane vibration, while the characteristic bands at 1300 and 1205 cm−1 are connected with C–C and C–H ring stretching, respectively. The sharp peak at 1052 cm−1 is ascribed to C–H in-plane vibrations. The band at 929 cm−1 can be attributed to N–H in-plane vibrations.42 In the spectra of SnO2–PPy-1 and SnO2–PPy-2, all the characteristic bonds for both SnO2 and PPy can be clearly observed. Therefore, the FTIR results confirm the presence of both PPy and SnO2 in the SnO2–PPy nanocomposites.
To investigate the interaction between the PPy, SnO2 and SnO2–PPy-2, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to detect the chemical states of elements. Peaks for C, Sn, and O in SnO2–PPy-2 were founded in the XPS survey spectrum, as shown in Fig. 2a. The Sn3d XPS spectra of SnO2 and SnO2–PPy-2 were collected to investigate the changes in the chemical state of tin before and after the hydrothermal reaction. In Fig. 2b, for both materials, there are two peaks, and the binding energy interval between them is 8 eV, which is consistent with the energy splitting of Sn or SnO2.43 For bare SnO2, the peaks found at 497.7 eV and 505.7 eV correspond to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 curves of Sn(IV) in SnOx.44,45 When SnO2 is coated with PPy, Sn3d peaks are shifted towards lower binding energies, i.e., 486.9 eV and 494.9 eV. These differences in the peak locations are obviously induced by the presence of PPy, which is conductive, while the bare SnO2 nanoparticles behave as an insulator in term of the XPS results.31 In the C1s spectra for bare SnO2 and SnO2–PPy-2, there is no obvious peak change, which means the absence of C–Sn bonds. This result indicates that no chemical reaction occurred during the preparation and that the composite structure is held together by van der Waals forces.

The morphologies of PPy, bare SnO2, SnO2–PPy-1 and SnO2–PPy-2 were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 3. The image of PPy shows a homogeneous morphology of strip-like 3-D structured tubes about 300–450 nm in diameter (Fig. 3a and e). For SnO2–PPy-1 and SnO2–PPy-2, in Fig. 3b, c, f and g, the coarse surface can be clearly observed, with the diameters of the tubes apparently increased compared to PPy. There is not obvious difference in the shape of SnO2–PPy-1 and SnO2–PPy-2. Fig. 3d and h show the bare SnO2 nanoparticles at different magnifications. The size of the SnO2 particles is similar to that in the composites. The uniformity of the material composition was also confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, as illustrated in Fig. 4. For the elemental mapping of Sn and O, the points clearly indicate that the SnO2 was homogeneously distributed on the PPy tubes.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was further used to investigate the changes in structure between PPy and SnO2–PPy-1, SnO2–PPy-2 composites. As displayed in Fig. 5a–c before coating with SnO2, the diameter of PPy is less than 450 nm. The diameters of the tubes were significantly increased for the both composites, and the diameters are larger than 550 nm, Fig. 5e and f all exhibit the (110) and (101) lattice fringes, which are found to reflect d-spacings of 0.343 and 0.263 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 5d) is well ascribed to the pure phase of SnO2, corresponding to the diffraction peaks of the (110), (101), (211), and (301) planes in the XRD pattern.

In addition, we used V-Sorb 2800P specific surface area analyser to measure the BET surface areas of PPy and composites. As shown on Table 1, the specific surface area of PPy tubes is only 12.65 m2 g−1. After loading SnO2 on it, the specific surface areas of SnO2–PPy-1 and SnO2–PPy-2 composites increased to 44.04 m2 g−1 and 48.32 m2 g−1 respectively, due to the SnO2 nanoparticles were loaded on the tubes. For composites, the average pore size which represents the size of pores formed by SnO2 nanoparticles. These pores provide the path to accommodate to the insertion/extraction of sodium ions. As for SnO2–PPy-2, its' surface area is bigger than SnO2–PPy-1. This can be inferred to the more content of SnO2 in SnO2–PPy-2.

The capacity and coulombic efficiency of the SnO2–PPy-1 and, SnO2–PPy-2 composites as a function of cycle number, at a constant current density of 100 mA g−1 with a cut-off voltage range from 0.01 to 1.5 V (vs. Na/Na+), are presented in Fig. 6a over 150 cycles. To clarify the contribution of the PPy matrix and the bare SnO2 to the electrochemical performance of the SnO2–PPy composites, they were also tested under the same current and voltage conditions. The reversible charge capacity of the SnO2–PPy-2 composite is about 288 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles, corresponding to 69.1% of the initial charge capacity. Even though the reversible charge capacity (246.2 mA h g−1) of the SnO2–PPy-1 composite is relatively lower than that of the SnO2–PPy-2 due to the lower content of SnO2, the capacity retention of 74.2% is higher than for SnO2–PPy-2. This indicates that a smaller amount of SnO2 nanoparticles can decrease the agglomeration of bare SnO2. The reversible charge capacity is much lower than that of SnO2–PPy-2, however, and the capacity fading is apparent. The contribution of PPy to the capacity of the SnO2–PPy composites can be neglected.

The coulombic efficiency for both SnO2–PPy-1 and SnO2–PPy-2 is near 100%, beginning from the second cycle, indicating that electrons/Na ions are no longer trapped in secondary parasitic reactions that can be introduced by further electrolyte degradation. The stable electrochemical performance of the SnO2–PPy composite and the enhanced capacity benefit from the synergetic effects generated by SnO2 particles on the PPy framework.31 This promotes greater conductivity of the SnO2 particles in the case of SnO2–PPy than in the case of nano-SnO2, as suggested by the XPS results (Fig. 2b).
In addition, the charge/discharge rate capability of the SnO2, SnO2–PPy-1 and SnO2–PPy-2 composites were investigated at increasing current rates by progressively increasing the current rate from 50 mA g−1 up to 1 A g−1 and finally returning it to 100 mA g−1, in order to test the robustness of the samples. Fig. 6b shows the cycling performances of the samples under these different current rate conditions. In the case of SnO2–PPy-2, the reversible charge capacity of the composite decreases from 428.7 (50 mA g−1), to 400.2 (0.1 A g−1), 354.2 (0.2 A g−1), 290.1 (0.4 A g−1), 260.2 (0.8 A g−1), and 160.3 mA h g−1 (1 A g−1), respectively, and the composite was found to successfully return to 398.9 mA h g−1 (recovering 99.7% of its initial capacity) after 60 cycles when the current density was returned to 0.1 A g−1. The rate capability of SnO2–PPy-1 shows lower reversible charge capacity compared to SnO2–PPy-2. This result is in line with their cycling performances. As for the bare SnO2, we can find this trend that with the increasing of current density, the capacity degraded more severely compared to both composites. Fig. 6c and d show the discharge–charge voltage profiles of the initial three cycles for SnO2–PPy-2 and bare SnO2. The 1st cycle discharge and 2nd cycle charge capacities of SnO2–PPy-2 composite electrode are 1040.6 and 416.6 mA h g−1, respectively, giving an initial coulombic efficiency of 40%. This is due to the formation of an irreversible solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the electrode surface and irreversible Na insertion into the active materials. The initial discharge–charge voltage profiles for bare SnO2 display the 1st cycle discharge capacity of 1217.3 mA h g−1 and the 2nd cycle charge capacity of 300.2 mA h g−1, giving a much lower initial coulombic efficiency of 24.7%.
The electrochemical reactions of the SnO2–PPy-2 nanocomposite were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. 6e, there is an irreversible transformation of SnO2 into Sn in the initial discharge process. Weak and irreversible shoulder peaks are seen at 1.4 and 0.6 V in the first negative scan. These peaks are attributed to some irreversible decomposition of the electrolyte, which forms a (SEI) film on the surface of the SnO2–PPy-2 composite, and to irreversible reactions between Na+ and the active materials. Two reductive peaks are observed at 0.28 and 0.02 V in the following cycles with different intensities, which are in accordance with the transformation of Sn into NaxSn alloys. In conformity with the Na–Sn binary alloy phase diagrams and previous reports,20,46 α-NaSn, Na9Sn4, Na3Sn, and Na15Sn4 are the main stable phases. It can be inferred that the reductive peak located at 0.28 V is related to the formation of a two-phase alloy of α-NaSn and Na9Sn4. Another reductive peak positioned at around 0.02 V is considered to be due to the formation of single phase Na3Sn and Na15Sn4. In the reverse positive scan, two oxidative peaks are obviously observed at approximately 0.28 V and 0.5 V, which indicates that the phase transitions during the de-alloying process had become clear. A hump that appeared at 0.28 V can be mainly assigned to the de-alloying reactions of Na3Sn, and Na15Sn4. The peak at 0.5 V is due to the Na9Sn4 de-alloying reactions.47
To verify the effects of PPy towards improving the cyclability of SnO2–PPy-2 electrode, which had better electronic conductivity compared to the bare SnO2 electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was carried out. The Nyquist plots and the fitting model using an equivalent circuit are depicted in Fig. 6f, with the equivalent circuit as the inset. Where Ri represents the total resistance of the electrolyte, separator, and electrical contacts. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) can be calculated from the semicircle within the high frequency region, which reflects the impedance related to the sodium ion transport through the film surface and charge transfer between the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The Warburg impedance (W) is observed from the inclined line in the low frequency region and represents the charge transfer by sodium ion diffusion through the material or electrolyte. The constant phase element (CPE) in the equivalent circuit is used to simulate an ideal capacitance. It can be observed that the sizes of the depressed semicircles for bare SnO2 in the fresh electrode and after 100 cycles have changed significantly, which indicates that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) has increased from 494.8 to 898.57 Ω. For SnO2–PPy-2, from the fresh cell to after 100 cycles, Rct of the electrode changed from 358.05 to 715.98 Ω, respectively. This implies that the electronic conductivity of the SnO2–PPy-2 sample was enhanced and benefited from the good electrical conductivity of the PPy in the composite, where it serves as both an active material and a conductor. The morphology of bare SnO2 electrode after cycling shows very obvious cracks (Fig. 7d). No cracks were observed for the SnO2–PPy-2 composite electrode after cycling, which is attributed to the SnO2–PPy-2 3-D structure with void space between the tubes, which could accommodate large volume changes during cycling. Further more, the homogeneous distribution of SnO2 nanoparticles on the PPy tube network is the key factor that provides the balancing force over the whole composite electrode and enhances the long-term electrochemical properties. These results are in good agreement with the EIS conclusions.

Conclusions
SnO2 nanoparticles were successfully coated on the surfaces of a PPy nanotube network via a simple, convenient, and environmentally friendly method. The obtained 3-D structured SnO2–PPy nanotube network demonstrates good performance as an anode for application in SIBs, especially with regards to the cyclability (over 150 cycles), with a high coulombic efficiency of 99.6% and good rate capability, recovering up to 99.7% of the initial charge capacity after several current variation cycles from 50 mA g−1 to 1 A g−1. These outcomes are attributed to the uniform coating of nanoscale tin dioxide particles on the PPy matrix with unique 3-D structure, which can significantly improve electronic conductivity of composites and acts as a buffer to alleviate the strain resulting from the volume changes in the electrodes during the cycling. At the same time, the diffusion speed of sodium ions is accelerated. On the other hand, a positive synergetic effect between the PPy interfaces and the SnO2 particles is responsible for maximization of the SnO2 conductivity. This is confirmed by the highly uniform distribution of particles. It is further demonstrated by the inferior performance of bare SnO2 particles with similar particle size. Accordingly, our results clearly demonstrate that the coated SnO2 particles on the PPy tubes generate synergetic effects during the cycling, enabling PPy to act as a conductor, which maximizes its utilization during insertion/extraction.
