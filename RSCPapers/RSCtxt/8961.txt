1. Introduction
Considering the requirements for renewable energy sources in the future, renewable energy sources including solar and wind are attracting ever-increasing attention. However, the efficient utilization of these energy sources is severely limited by the intermittent and fluctuating power output. Electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies, such as rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, and electrocatalysis, recently are proved to be the key for solving this problem.1,2 For example, electricity generated from solar or wind energy can be stored and released from rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors, or transformed into small molecules like H2, CH4, and NH3 by electrocatalysis and further applied in fuel cells.3,4
Despite their different working principles, batteries/capacitors and electrocatalysis include similar electrochemical reactions for the same electrochemical components (cathode, anode, and electrolyte). In principle, the performance of different devices was governed by the electrochemical (such as redox and catalytic activity) and physical (such as electronic and ionic conductivity) properties of active materials used in the components. Therefore, looking for materials with excellent properties has been a major requirement for the development of future electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies.
Carbon materials, from traditional amorphous carbon to the more recent nanotube, graphene and fullerene, are popular due to their excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, mechanical/chemical strength, and large surface area throughout a wide potential window. These properties are all beneficial to design of energy storage/conversion electrodes or catalysts with high performance.5–9 Of the high-capacity and -activity materials proposed, heteroatom-doped carbons have recently emerged as low cost, useful, tunable structures via the optimization of the synthesis method, because of their enhanced electrochemical properties.10,11 By increasing the number of electrochemically active sites and facilitating charge transfer between the electrolyte and electrode surface, the carbon architectures doped with B, N, F, P, etc. have been postulated to enhance their electrochemical performance compared to undoped carbons.12–15 N doping is considered to be the most common strategy for increasing the electrochemical properties of carbon materials.11,16–21 N is similar in atomic size to C, but has a different electron configuration. The carbon materials doped with N atoms could change the electronic structure without impacting the carbon lattice.22 However, the performance of N doped carbon materials is dependent not only on the content of N atoms but also on the bonding environment of N.6 During the design of high-performance materials, controlling parameters and preparation methods is important and has attracted great research attention.
Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) is an ordered graphite-like semiconducting material with facile synthesis, low cost, high stability, a tunable structure, and a suitable bandgap.23 Since the first report by Wang et al. in 2009,24 great attention has been paid to its applications in photocatalysis.25,26 In addition, the heptazine hetero-rings of PCN contain a high level of pyridine-like N, which could provide rich electron lone pairs to facilitate electrochemical reactions.27 Therefore, unlike ordinary N doped carbon materials that contain complicated N species with a low N content, PCN can provide abundant and uniform N coordinators, and more available catalytically active sites.28–31 In fact, some research studies concentrating on the fabrication and application of PCN-based electrode materials have been widely implemented.32–34 Nevertheless, pristine PCN always shows poor electrical conductivity induced serious irreversible capacity loss in the application of electrochemical energy conversion and storage.30,35–38 Recently, some common strategies including carbon material–PCN heterostructure construction and C doping have been performed on PCN, which resulted in excellent improvements in electrochemical properties.32 In fact, these methods mentioned above have the features of transforming PCN into N-doped carbon materials with varying N content and functionalities.
Especially in recent years, there has been lots of work focused on the regulation of the N content of PCN and its application in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. However, the related reviews are rarely reported. Thus, it seems timely to offer a review providing insight into this theme. In this review, we highlight the latest research advancements of PCN and PCN derived carbon materials applied in electrochemical energy conversion (hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER),9,35,39 nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), etc.)27,39 and storage (Li–ion batteries, Li–S batteries, Li–air batteries, Zn–air batteries, supercapacitors, etc.),34 as shown in Scheme 1. At the same time, we briefly introduce the challenges and future trends of PCN based electrochemical materials.

2. PCN-based materials for electrochemical energy conversion and storage
As an n-type semiconductor, PCN possesses a unique structure and properties: (1) graphene-like structure. PCN has a stacked two-dimensional (2D) structure; meanwhile each 2D structure consists of sp2 hybridized conjugated C and N atoms. (2) High stability. PCN is hard to dissolve in alkali, acidic or organic solvents, and exhibits preeminent thermal stability even up to 600 °C in air for the aromatic C–N heterocycles, which proved it to be a tough material with promising stability. (3) High N atom content. Three N species are identified in the structure of PCN, including bridge-N, graphitic-N, and pyridinic-N. The N atom content is calculated to be up to 57.1 at%. Due to the large number of electrochemically active sites present in the lattice, PCN with a high N atom content recently has drawn great research attention in the field of electrochemical energy conversion/storage.34,40,41 For example, the high N content of PCN with a layered structure can provide abundant and overall evenly distributed N vacancies (NVs).39,42 The π-electron delocalization in the conjugated system of PCN could be modulated by the introduced NVs, which might manage the challenges in realizing strong N2 activation and adsorption in nitrogen fixation. By this, Yu and co-workers proposed a defect engineering strategy to realize effective electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance (NH3 yield: 8.09 μg h−1 mg−1, faradaic efficiency: 11.59%) on metal-free PCN catalysts,43 as shown in Fig. 1. By constructing a binuclear end-on bound structure for spatial electron transfer, density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrated that the dinitrogen molecule can be chemisorbed on the as-designed NVs of PCN. Furthermore, the increased N–N bond length of adsorbed N2 indicated the “strong activation” effect of NVs. This work highlights the significance of NVs in improving the PCN electrocatalyst with poor N2 activation and adsorption ability.

For the application of electrochemical energy storage, the stacked 2D structure (interlayer Li+ diffusion pathway) and high N content (abundant active sites to capture Li+) make PCN a promising material for efficient Li+ intercalation (the electrochemical reaction can be presented as: PCN + 2Li+ + 2e− = Li2-PCN, the corresponding theoretical specific capacity is about 520 mA h g−1). In addition, the micro-electric field induced by the six π-electrons of the N atoms at the tri-s-triazine units of PCN not only gives PCN more Li nucleation sites for excellent Li affinity but also remarkably lowers the Li nucleation overpotential.42,44 Furthermore, due to its unique layered structure and abundant reactive sites, recently PCN has also been chosen as a special interface “enabler” in solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs).45,46 For example, Huang and co-workers discovered that the Li metal/garnet-type solid-state electrolyte interface of SSLMBs can change from point contact to intimate contact with the introduction of PCN into Li metal (Li–C3N4), as shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, the introduction of PCN can also greatly enhance the capability to suppress the dendritic Li formation for the greatly enhanced viscosity, decreased surface tension of molten Li and the in situ formation of Li3N at the interface. Thus, the resulting Li–C3N4|SSE|Li–C3N4 symmetric cell exhibited an ultralow interfacial resistance of 11 Ω cm2 and a fairly high critical current density (CCD) of 1500 μA cm−2.46 This work paved a promising way for the rational design of Li metal-based composite anodes by using the PCN material for high safety SSLMBs.

Unfortunately, due to the weak van der Waals forces between layers and the abundant hydrogen bonds in the interlayer framework, the pristine PCN shows sluggish charge transfer kinetics and poor electrical conductivity (less than 1 S cm−1), which severely impacted the applications of PCN in electrochemical energy storage.47 Thus, the development of PCN-based electrodes with high performance for electrochemical energy storage and conversion is still relatively limited. Recently, in order to increase the ionic and electrical conductivity of PCN, numerous works had been performed. Recently, extensive efforts have been made to improve the electrical conductivity of PCN via compositing with electroconductive carbon-based materials, such as conductive graphene,36,48–54 polymers,55 carbon nanotubes,56 and MXenes.57
Since both PCN and graphene possess similar graphitic structures, modifying PCN with graphene is considered as an effective strategy to improve the performance of PCN-based electrodes.48,54 Wang and co-workers explored the performance of the asymmetric supercapacitors by using rGO/PCN as the negative electrode.49 Surprisingly, this device showed an energy density of 36.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 480 W kg−1 and outstanding cycling durability (95% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). Liu and co-workers innovatively prepared a 3D C-PCN@rGO hybrid.36 The hybrid exhibited a specific capacitance of 379.7 F g−1 at a current density of 0.25 A g−1 from the galvanic charge and discharge test, and 85% capacitance retention was observed after 10000 galvanic charge–discharge cycles.
Although PCN–carbon containing hybrid materials could be fabricated to improve electric properties, the properties of these composites were still below par for the application of electrochemical energy storage and conversion. This was due to the unstable interphase boundaries induced by the weak intermolecular force of the composite. This drawback would lead to fast capacity degradation with short charge lifetime when applied as electrodes for electrochemical energy storage/conversion systems. To this end, Chen and co-workers reported an ultrathin conductive PCN (g-C3N4) prepared (thickness of ∼1.0 nm) by the graphene-templated van der Waals epitaxial method with high electrical conductivity (12.2 S cm−1), an appropriate N doping level (18.29%), a large surface area (724.9 m2 g−1), and narrow pore-size distribution (5.3 nm). The N doped ultra-thin structure provided numerous active sites and channels for effective ion storage and transportation, and the layered graphene acted as an efficient current collector. The assembled supercapacitors showed an energy storage capability of 936 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 with excellent stability of over 10000 cycles. In addition, the all-solid-state supercapacitors also exhibited an ultra-high energy density of 281.3 μW h cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 with high coulombic efficiency and rate capability, as shown in Fig. 3.52 This work greatly promoted the application of PCN in energy storage.

In addition to the unstable interphase boundaries, in the system of PCN/carbon-containing materials, the limited functional groups are one of the main factors restricting the application in energy storage/conversion. For example, the large molecular structure of PCN greatly limits the number of edge N atoms, which are the major contributions for pseudocapacitance. To do this, by combining graphene with pre-oxidized PCN, Parkin and co-workers both increased the edge N content of PCN and the functional groups for use as strong hinges.50 Subsequently, the large PCN layered structures were cut into smaller segments by the further oxidation process, which increased the proportion of edge N significantly. In addition, the electrical conductivity of the hybrid also improved substantially when combined with reduced graphene oxide aerogels. The obtained composite showed high specific capacitance, outstanding stability and capacitive behavior in different electrolytes.
Overall, due to its enhanced conductivity and activity, the PCN after hybridizing with carbon-containing materials has added advantages for electrochemical energy conversion/storage. By using the excellent electrical conductivity of carbon-containing materials, the heterogeneous hybrids can exhibit fast electron and matter shuttle in the related electrochemical reactions.
3. PCN-derived carbon materials for energy conversion and storage
In the search of N-doped carbon materials with excellent electrochemical performance, PCN is impressive owing to its simple synthesis by thermal polymerization of low-cost precursors and a high content of structural N (∼57% atomic N). However, the poor electrical conductivity of pristine PCN limited its utility in energy storage and conversion applications. Previous studies have found the electrical conductivity of PCN via hybridizing with carbon-containing materials. In fact, PCN is also regarded as a promising N-doped carbon material precursor due to its fairly high N content and easy accessibility which undergoes full thermolysis at higher temperature.58 By further regulating the N content, PCN-derived N doped carbon materials recently have drawn extensive attention for improving the electrochemical performance.59–62
Thermolysis temperature and precursor species are two key factors to realize the transformation from PCN to N doped carbon materials.59,62,63 For example, Antonietti and co-workers pioneered a two-step heating of a mixture of dicyandiamide (for the in situ formation of PCN) and glucose for acquisition of directly synthesized graphene-like flakes, as shown in Fig. 4a–g.60 The N content of graphene nanosheets (NGs) can be well-tuned by the heating temperature and reaction time. The N atom doped layered graphene showed an increased intensity ratio of the D and G-bands in the Raman spectra (Fig. 4b), and further XPS analysis (Fig. 4d) revealed the decreased N content (from 26.8 atom% to 4.3 atom%) when increasing the synthesis temperature and/or time. Undoubtedly, the properties of the as-formed graphene samples can be changed after the variation of the N content. The NG1 (N content: 26.8 atom%) showed a bulk conductivity of 0.017 Sm−1, which is 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of graphene. Song and co-workers demonstrated a one-pot direct transformation from PCN to N-doped graphene, as shown in Fig. 4h–l.61 The relative contents of graphitic and pyridinic-N were controlled by the annealing process. The resulting N-doped graphene materials showed excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR. Moreover, the target product also showed a much-enhanced durability and tolerance to methanol in alkaline medium as compared to the conventional Pt/C electrocatalyst. This may be because a higher N content is not the requisite to enhanced electrocatalytic activity of catalysts. Conversely, the N-doped graphene obtained by annealing at 900 °C (NGA900) with a relatively low N content and a high ratio of graphitic-N/pyridinic-N displayed the most promising activity for the ORR. Therefore, the N doped carbon material prepared by PCN transformation is an effective method to control N content and function, which can facilitate the practical application of PCN as an effective and stable electrode material and catalyst. Moreover, the PCN-derived carbon materials also showed broad application prospects in electrochemical energy conversion.58,64 For example, Lv and co-workers successfully prepared N doped 2D carbon materials (NC) by using the PCN template and dopamine (DA) as N and C sources at different annealing temperatures, as shown in Fig. 4m–o. This non-metallic electrocatalyst has a porous carbon structure with a high specific surface area (954 m2 g−1) and a high N concentration (5.71%), which accelerates electron conduction, and more importantly due to the higher content of graphite-N and pyridine-N provides a very active site for the ORR.58 The N dopant of carbon materials obtained by this method has a high activity and durability compared to that of a Pt/C electrocatalyst.

In the process of transformation from PCN to carbon materials, the regulation of structure and functional groups can effectively improve the electrochemical energy storage performance of the prepared materials. For example, the sp2-hybridized pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N species that are mainly present at edge sites of carbon layers are favorable for Li+ storage, and graphitic-N is postulated to bind with Li+ irreversibly and degrade cycling stability.44,65 Mullins and co-workers transformed pristine PCN into N-doped carbons for potential utility in LIB anodes via the Cu template, as shown in Fig. 5a–e.66 The N-doped carbon materials fabricated through the extent of metal alloying with carbon and nitrogen showed favorable surface chemistry and resulting Li+ storage performance. Compared to the carbon materials formed by alloying with Fe (<10% N content), nanoalloying with Cu produces carbon materials with a smaller degree of graphitization that are highly defective with a high N content (32–24%). Moreover, the Cu templated carbon annealed at 750 °C (C3N4–Cu750) with the high surface N has the lowest graphitic-N content (6.9% N content). And the carbon material with the highest combined pyrrolic-N (26.9% of total surface N content) and pyridinic-N (64.8% of total surface N content) is most favorable for Li+ storage. Desirably, the LIB assembled with the C3N4–Cu750 carbon showed the highest specific capacity of 900 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 275 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1 with excellent cycling stability (retained 96% after 2000 cycles). Moreover, in the application of SIBs, traditional graphite fails to provide sufficient interlayer spacing (≈0.34 nm) to host Na+. Recently both experimental results and theoretical calculations show that the energy barrier for Na+ insertion into graphite layers can be reduced to a surmountable level once the interlayer distance is increased to 0.37 nm. Qiao and co-workers presented the synthesis of N-doped few-layer graphene (N-FLG) by annealing PCN as a N-rich precursor under the assistance of the Zn catalyst.67 The Zn-assisted thermal treatment of PCN produces 2D N-FLG-T (T represents the temperature) with a tunable enlarged interlayer distance ranging from 0.45 to 0.51 nm by varying the calcination temperature. Simultaneously, the synthetic temperature also plays a vital role in controlling the N-doping levels and configurations. More importantly, due to the stronger electrostatic repulsion, the effect of pyrrolic N on the enlargement of graphene interlayer spacing had been highlighted by the correlation between the N heteroatoms and interlayer distance of N-FLG-T. Therefore, in terms of N configuration, interlayer spacing, and electronic conductivity, N-FLG-800 showed optimal properties. As a consequence, the SIBs assembled by N-FLG-800 showed ultrahigh rate capability (56.6 mA h g−1 at 40 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (211.3 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 2000 cycles) due to the distinguished Na+ storage performance (Fig. 5f–k). The identification of the effects of different N configurations in this work creates a new dimension to construct advanced carbon nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage technologies.

In addition to being the precursor, PCN can also act as a N dopant of carbon materials. For example, Chen and co-workers developed an efficient and facile method to prepare highly wrinkled N-doped graphene nanosheets (C-NGNSs) via PCN/GO as the precursor.68 As shown in Fig. 6a–f, during the polymerization process, GO could be effectively reduced to graphene, and the PCN polymer on GO could completely decompose into nitrogen-containing species (e.g., C2N2+, C3N2+, C3N3+) that afford nitrogen sources for final synthesis of C-NGNSs. Therefore, due to the N doping, high pore volume, abundant wrinkled structures, and improved electrical conductivity, the C-NGNSs (9.96% N obtained at 900 °C) exhibited significant improvement of performance parameters of supercapacitors (e.g., capacity, rate, cycling).

Recently, the structure of the graphene confined PCN precursor has gradually attracted attention for the special synthetic process. By using graphene wrapped PCN as the template via a two-step method (plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)-high temperature pyrolysis process), Li and co-workers in situ fabricated N-doped porous graphene-like carbon sheets (NPGCs), as shown in Fig. 6j–l.69 The results showed that the resultant NPGCs had a range of intriguing features, such as good wettability, high N doping (8.75 wt%), and high conductivity (693 S m−1). When used as the supercapacitor electrode, the NPGC based device showed a remarkable specific capacitance (261 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), excellent rate capability (189 F g−1 even at 100 A g−1), and outstanding cycling stability (97% capacitance retention at 10 A g−1 after 20000 cycles), which is superior to most carbon-based materials. This work opened up a new way for developing efficient N-doped porous carbon materials of supercapacitors by using PCN in a facile and viable way. Moreover, by engineering a “microreactor” consisting of melamine fiber (inside) and graphene oxide (GO, outside), Song and co-workers fabricated a special type of three dimensional (3D) N-doped graphene as anode materials for SIBs, as shown in Fig. 6m–q.70 Through a precise pyrolysis temperature control, as the precursor of PCN, the inside melamine fiber has been converted into N-doped graphene. Combined with the outside reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) evolved by the GO layer, the “microreactor” transformed into interconnected 3D N-doped graphene structures. The resultant 3D graphene-based SIBs showed reversible Na+ storage capacities up to ∼305 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and a promising cycling stability (∼221 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 2000 cycles). The high capacity, superior cycling stability, and the facile synthesis procedure of the 3D N doped graphene made it a promising anode material for further energy storage applications.
4. Summary and outlook
In this review, we have reviewed recent advances in the development of PCN from PCN based materials to PCN derived carbon materials for applications involved in electrochemical energy conversion and storage including electrocatalysis, supercapacitors and batteries. With a unique structure analogous to graphite and a high content of N, PCN has attracted increasing attention in the field of electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Even so, due to the poor electrical conductivity induced by the high content of N, the application of PCN was limited extremely. Recently, in order to extend the electrochemical application of PCN, the studies of decreasing the content of N from PCN based materials including modification and hybrid with carbon-containing materials to PCN-derived carbon materials have been greatly explored. The review of N content modulation of PCN provides us a new cognition of PCN in the field of electrochemical energy conversion and storage.
It is worth noting that despite the above new achievements on expanding applications of PCN, there are several challenges and trends that still remain. Firstly, the molecular structure and electrochemical properties of the PCN derived carbon materials and common N doped carbon materials should be compared and distinguished. Compared to common N doped carbon materials, PCN derived carbon materials are simpler to prepare. However, there has been very little comparison in the specific N contents, N types, and electrochemical properties of the above two. Secondly, in the system of PCN based carbon materials, fundamentally understanding the electrochemical catalytic mechanisms and the relationship between the catalytic activity and N types by theoretical calculations (molecular and electronic levels) is necessary and important in future. Thirdly, the nanostructure is undoubtedly a crucial feature that decides the electrocatalytic activity and energy storage/conversion. Exploring PCN based carbon materials with a high surface area and tunable pore size for the purpose of achieving more abundant active sites and better mass transfer is another important goal. Finally, much attention should be paid to the hybrid of PCN and metal based materials.9,47,71 Metal oxides,49,72 MOFs,73–75 MXenes, single atoms,4,38,40,56,76–80etc. recently have drawn great attention in the field of energy conversion and storage for their high catalytic activity. In addition, the above metal-based materials also possess excellent conductivity. Therefore, we believe that the hybrid of metal and PCN based carbon materials will show outstanding performances in the field of energy storage and conversion. It is believed that PCN related materials will have broader applications for electrochemical energy storage and conversion in the near future.
