    , Accepted 30th November 2010First published on 17th January 2011AbstractThe oxidation of iodide to diiodide, I2˙−, by the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) excited state of [Ru(deeb)3]2+, where deeb is 4,4′-(CO2CH2CH3)2-2,2′-bipyridine, was quantified in acetonitrile and dichloromethane solution at room temperature. The redox and excited state properties of [Ru(deeb)3]2+ were similar in the two solvents; however, the mechanisms for excited state quenching by iodide were found to differ significantly. In acetonitrile, reaction of [Ru(deeb)3]2+* and iodide was dynamic (lifetime quenching) with kinetics that followed the Stern–Volmer model (KD = 1.0 ± 0.01 × 105 M−1, kq = 4.8 × 1010 M−1s−1). Excited state reactivity was observed to be the result of reductive quenching that yielded the reduced ruthenium compound, [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+, and the iodine atom, I˙. In dichloromethane, excited state quenching was primarily static (photoluminescence amplitude quenching) and [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ formed within 10 ns, consistent with the formation of ion pairs in the ground state that react rapidly upon visible light absorption. In both solvents the appearance of I2˙− could be time resolved. In acetonitrile, the rate constant for I2˙−growth, 2.2 ± 0.2 × 1010 M−1s−1, was found to be about a factor of two slower than the formation of [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+, indicating it was a secondary photoproduct. The delayed appearance of I2˙− was attributed to the reaction of iodine atoms with iodide. In dichloromethane, the growth of I2˙−, 1.3 ± 0.4 × 1010 M−1s−1, was similar to that in acetonitrile, yet resulted from iodine atoms formed within the laser pulse. These results are discussed within the context of solar energy conversion by dye-sensitized solar cells and storagevia chemical bond formation.
Introduction
There exists very little information on how one might use solar photons to generate covalent bonds.1 Such information is important for the efficient conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels.2 While chemical bonds are often generated in photoelectrochemical cells and photocatalytic materials, the mechanisms by which they are formed generally remain elusive. For example, it has been over 35 years since the celebrated report of water splitting by Fujishima and Honda, yet the mechanism of O–O bond formation at the illuminated TiO2 interface remains unknown.1 In this regard, the study of model compounds in homogeneous solution could provide mechanistic detail on a molecular level that would help optimize reactions in heterogeneous environments such as those discovered by Fujishima and Honda.
It has been previously reported that the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited state of [Ru(bpz)2(deeb)]2+, where bpz is 2,2′-bipyrazine and deeb is 4,4′-(CO2CH2CH3)2-2,2′-bipyridine, is able to oxidize iodide (I−) to the iodine atom (I˙) in acetonitrile solution, eqn (1).3,4 Subsequent reaction of the iodine atom with an iodide anion results in I–I bond formation by generating the iodine radical anion, I2˙−, hereby referred to as diiodide, eqn (2). In this system, excited state decay was correlated with formation of the reduced ruthenium compound, [Ru(bpz−)(bpz)(deeb)]+, indicating that it was a primary reaction product. The appearance of I2˙− was shown to occur with a factor of three slower rate constant than that of [Ru(bpz−)(bpz)(deeb)]+, which indicated that the two reaction products formed by independent pathways. The rate constant obtained for formation of I2˙− through an iodine atom intermediate, 2.4 ± 0.2 × 1010 M−1s−1, was consistent with other literature reports and suggested the I–I bond formation occurs rapidly when iodine atoms are generated in the presence of iodide anions.5,6 [Ru(bpz)2(deeb)]2+* + I− → [Ru(bpz−)(bpz)(deeb)]+ + I˙(1) I˙ + I− → I2˙−(2)
In contrast to diffusion limited generation of I–I bonds, visible light excitation of ion pairs has been shown to generate I2˙− on very short time scales.7,8 Here, [Ru(bpy)2(deeb)]2+, where bpy is 2,2′-bipyridine, and iodide were present as ion pairs in dichloromethane solvent. Visible light excitation of such ion-pairs led to an instrument response limited appearance of the reduced ruthenium compound and diiodide, eqn (3). X-ray crystallographic studies in the solid state revealed that the two iodides were approximately 6 Å apart and associated with the carbonyl carbons of the ester groups. Although it was not proven, the orientation of the iodide anions relative to each other and the rapid time scale of the reaction were consistent with concerted electron transfer and I–I bond formation. This reaction has been shown in the literature to occur at potentials more negative than that of iodine atom formation and is therefore thermodynamically more accessible if the correct ion pair orientation can be achieved.9,10 (3)
Further literature accounts suggest that the interaction between iodide and π-conjugated moieties is more general. Recently Berryman et al. crystallized a series of halide cyanoarene pairs from chloroform and found that the iodide anion and the ring carbons of the π-system within a single van der Waals radius.11 The interaction between iodide and the electron deficient edge carbons was far greater than with the electron rich center of the π-system. Evidence for interaction between iodide and the π orbitals of a bipyridyl coordination compound12 as well as viologen/pyridinium13–15 species have also been reported. Knowledge of how these interactions influence excited state electron transfer is of fundamental importance to driving chemical fuel production with solar photons.
The previously characterized MLCT excited state reactions with iodide suggested different mechanisms for formation of the I–I bond in I2˙−. The oxidation of iodide by [Ru(bpz)2(deeb)]2+* in acetonitrile yielded iodine atoms that subsequently reacted with iodide to form diiodide while oxidation by [Ru(bpy)2(deeb)]2+* in dichloromethane yielded I2˙− on a sub-nanosecond time scale.4,8 A significant difference between the two reactions was the formation of ion-pairs in dichloromethane. Hence there is good reason to believe that the reaction pathway for iodide oxidation depends on whether ion-pairs and/or specific donor–acceptor adducts are formed. There is further interest in being able to control the reaction pathway by which iodide is oxidized as reactive intermediates, like the iodine atom or diiodide, may be electron acceptors that mediate unwanted charge recombination in dye-sensitized solar cells, where I−/I3− is the most efficient redox mediator currently available.16,17
Comparisons of the previously mentioned studies are complicated by the fact that both the solvent and the molecular excited state were different. In keeping with the study of excited state reactivity where reactions may be photo-initiated and characterized on short time scales, a potentially interesting molecular photo-oxidant that is soluble in both acetonitrile and dichloromethane is [Ru(deeb)3]2+*. The presence of the six ethyl ester groups results in reduction potentials quite similar to that for the previously characterized [Ru(bpz)2(deeb)]2+ as well as an expected increase in the probability of ion pair formation. Here we report investigations of excited state iodide oxidation by [Ru(deeb)3]2+* when ion-pairs were clearly evident (dichloromethane) and when they were not (acetonitrile). The results indicate that the time scale for excited state electron transfer can be increased dramatically when [Ru(deeb)3]I+ ion pairs are formed in non-polar solvent prior to light absorption. We note that we recently reported the reaction of [Ru(deeb)3]2+* and I− in acetonitrile for large iodide concentrations but did not investigate the intimate mechanism.18
Results
The electronic absorption spectrum of [Ru(deeb)3](PF6)2 was measured in acetonitrile and dichloromethane. The concentration dependence followed Beer's Law from which extinction coefficients were abstracted, Table 1. Absorption spectra in acetonitrile and dichloromethane were nearly identical with an MLCT maximum centered at ∼ 465 nm, Fig. 1. The absorption spectra of the one electron reduced compound, [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+, was obtained by continuous light excitation of solutions in the presence of triethanolamine under anaerobic conditions as has been previously described.19Spectra of [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ were similar in both solvents; with only a minor increase and broadening in acetonitrile. The [Ru(deeb)3]2+ spectra were regenerated upon exposure of [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ to air. Isosbestic points between these two redox states were observed at 425 and 488 nm in both solvents.

Electronic absorption spectra of [Ru(deeb)3]2+ (green and black) and [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ (blue and red) in acetonitrile and dichloromethane, respectively. 

Fig. 2 shows absorption spectra of a 38 μM [Ru(deeb)3]2+ dichloromethane solution as the tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) concentration was increased from 0 to 100 μM. The MLCT absorption band was observed to broaden with an increase in molar absorptivity at all wavelengths except between 458 and 477 nm. These changes were attributed to ion-pairing in the ground state between [Ru(deeb)3]2+ and I−. The addition of 100 mM TBAPF6 regenerated the original [Ru(deeb)3]2+ absorption spectrum. Similar experiments conducted in acetonitrile solution showed no changes in the visible region and only incremental increases ca. 245 nm due to absorption by iodide, Fig. 2 inset.
 Fig. 2  Changes in the electronic absorption spectrum of [Ru(deeb)3]2+ upon addition of TBAI to dichloromethane solution. Isosbestic points, 458 and 477 nm, were maintained as the concentration of iodide was increased. (inset) Data obtained in acetonitrile solution over a similar TBAI concentration range showing no visible spectral changes. 
Visible light excitation of [Ru(deeb)3](PF6)2 in acetonitrile and dichloromethane resulted in room temperature photoluminescence (PL). The steady state PL spectra were weakly solvent dependent with maxima at 634 and 622 nm for acetonitrile and dichloromethane, respectively. The quantum yield for photoluminescence, ϕPL, in the two solvents differed by roughly a factor of two. In acetonitrile the quantum yield was found to be 0.13 ± 0.03 while that in dichloromethane was estimated to be 0.31 ± 0.01. Excited state free energies, ΔGes, were estimated by a tangent line extrapolation back to zero intensity along the high energy edge of the room temperature PL spectra. These values were used to estimate excited state reduction potentials by the equation Eo(Ru2+*/+) = Eo(RuII/+) + ΔGes, Table 1. The one electron reduction potential, Eo(RuII/+), was determined by cyclic voltammetry where a quasi-reversible wave was observed at −0.88 and −0.96 V vs.SCE in acetonitrile and dichloromethane respectively.
Time resolved photoluminescence measurements at 620 nm in neat acetonitrile and dichloromethane were well described by a first-order kinetic model and yielded excited state lifetimes of 2.1 and 2.2 μs, respectively. Addition of TBAI resulted in efficient quenching of excited state molecules; from which Stern–Volmer analyses revealed striking differences between the mechanisms of excited state reactivity (i.e. static vs. dynamic) for the two solvents, Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Time resolved photoluminescence decays monitored at 620 nm for [Ru(deeb)3]2+* in acetonitrile (A) and dichloromethane (B) as a function of increased [TBAI]. (inset A) A Stern–Volmer plot for lifetime quenching from which KSV = 1.0 ± 0.1 × 105 M−1 was abstracted. (inset B) A Stern–Volmer plot for both lifetime (black) and amplitude (red) quenching components where quenching constants, KSV = 4.1 ± 0.2 × 104 M−1 and Keq = 2.30 ± 0.03 × 105 M−1, were abstracted. 
In acetonitrile solution, the excited state lifetime, τ, decreased as a function of iodide concentration. The dependence of τ0/τ on [I−] was linear and fit well to the Stern–Volmer law,20eqn (4), yielding a quenching constant, KSV = 1.0 ± 0.1 × 105 M−1, Fig. 3A. This value is related to the bimolecular quenching rate constant by the equation, kq = KSV/τ0 = 4.8 × 1010 M−1s−1. A small decrease in the initial time-resolved photoluminescence amplitude, α, was also observed with increased [I−]; however, a plot of α0/α vs. [I−] was erratic and showed no meaningful dependence.  (4)

        In dichloromethane, the addition of TBAI resulted in significant loss of time-resolved photoluminescence amplitude as well as decreased excited state lifetimes, Fig. 3B. The time resolved PL amplitude is proportional to the concentration of excited state molecules initially generated upon light excitation and therefore amplitude quenching was attributed to an increased concentration of ground state ion pairs. These adducts may react immediately upon excitation and result in a loss of initial PL amplitude. A plot of α0/α vs.iodide concentration was non-linear and more quadratic in nature, Fig. 4. This behavior was attributed to a large equilibrium constant for ion pairing of [Ru(deeb)3]2+ and iodide. Under this condition the total iodide concentration, [I−]0, is not equal to the concentration of ‘free’ iodide, [I−]free. A linear trend is expected if [I−]0 = [I−]free, eqn (5).20 A revised equation was therefore used to account for the difference in ‘total’ and ‘free’ iodide, eqn (6). (See Appendix for derivation) The equilibrium constant, Keq = 2.30 ± 0.03 × 105 M−1, obtained from Fig. 4 was then used to calculate [I−]free and plot the amplitude quenching data in its linear form, Fig. 3B inset.  (5) (6)
 Fig. 4  Amplitude quenching data for [Ru(deeb)3]2+ in dichloromethane solution plotted vs. total iodide concentration, [I−]0. The data was fit to eqn (6) ([Ru2+]0 = 21.3 μM). 
Excited state lifetime quenching in dichloromethane was linear vs. [I−]free and yielded the Stern–Volmer quenching constant, KSV = 4.1 ± 0.2 × 104 M−1 (kq = 1.9 × 1010 M−1s−1). The presence of 100 mM TBAPF6 in dichloromethane solution resulted in no observed loss in time resolved PL amplitude and an order-of-magnitude smaller Stern–Volmer quenching constant, KSV = 5.4 ± 0.1 × 103 M−1 (kq = 2.5 × 109 M−1s−1).
Transient absorption difference spectra measured after pulsed 532 nm laser excitation of [Ru(deeb)3](PF6)2 in acetonitrile and dichloromethane displayed a bleach of the MLCT band centered at 465 nm and excited state absorption bands in the near-IR and near-UV. Isosbestic points were observed at 406 and ∼540 nm in CH3CN and at 408 and ∼530 nm in CH2Cl2. Due to the intense 532 nm excitation, there was difficulty in resolving the [Ru(deeb)3]2+ ground/excited-state isosbestic point between 520 and 540 nm and the values are therefore estimates within ± 3 nm. The spectra returned cleanly to the baseline with first-order kinetics and lifetimes that were within experimental error to those obtained by time resolved photoluminescence.
Transient absorption measurements were made as a function of iodide concentration to assess the chemical nature of excited state quenching. Indeed, in both solvents transient absorption bands consistent with the reduced ruthenium compound, [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+, and diiodide were observed post visible light excitation, thus confirming electron transfer as an operative pathway for excited state quenching. Specifically, single wavelength measurements recorded at 540 nm were strongly indicative of [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ while data obtained at 406/408 nm, a ground/excited state isosbestic point, revealed information on both I2˙− and [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+. In addition, the ground/reduced state isosbestic point, 425 nm, was often chosen to study I2˙− and [Ru(deeb)3]2+*.

Fig. 5A shows representative single wavelength transient absorption data obtained in acetonitrile solution. Clearly evident is the synchronous growth at 540 nm coupled to photoluminescence decay at 620 nm, indicating that [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ was a primary photoproduct of excited state quenching. Data at 406 nm showed a measurable growth different from that at 540 nm. Although both [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ and I2˙− absorb light at 406 nm, this slower growth feature was mostly attributed to I2˙− being generated as a secondary photoproduct. Further evidence for this assignment was present at 425 nm where the positive growth of the signal was found to match the kinetics of 406 nm.
 Fig. 5  A) Representative single wavelength transient absorption traces monitored at 540 (black), 425 (blue), and 406 nm (red) after 532 nm excitation of [Ru(deeb)3]2+ in a 42 μM [I−] acetonitrile solution. A time resolved PL decay monitored at 620 nm (green) is also shown for comparison. B) Pseudo-first-order rate constants, kobs, obtained from kinetic fits as a function of total iodide concentration, [I−]0. 
Transient absorption at 540 nm was fit to a first-order kinetic model at all iodide concentrations. Data at 425 and 406 nm were fit to a sum of two first-order equations in order to account for the two separately absorbing species at each wavelength. That is, both [Ru(deeb)3]2+* and I2˙− absorb light at 425 nm and both [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ and I2˙− absorb light at 406 nm. Observed rate constants obtained from these fits plotted as a function of iodide concentration were linear over the range studied and yielded second-order rate constants, Fig. 5B. The rate constant for transient growth at 540 nm, k540 = 5.1 ± 0.4 × 1010 M−1s−1, was found to be in good agreement with that for photoluminescence decay at 620 nm reported above. For data at 425 and 406 nm, second-order rate constants were calculated for both sets of first-order components: k425 A = 5.0 ± 0.1 × 1010 M−1s−1, k425 B = 2.2 ± 0.1 × 1010 M−1s−1, k406 A = 4.8 ± 0.2 × 1010 M−1s−1, k406 B = 2.2 ± 0.2 × 1010 M−1s−1.

        In dichloromethane, single wavelength transient absorption measurements further supported the presence of ion pairs upon visible light excitation. Fig. 6A shows representative data where the rise in transient absorption at 540 nm could not be time resolved, indicating that [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ was formed within the instrument response time. An instantaneous rise at 408 nm was also observed followed by transient growth. This was associated with the rapid appearance of [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ and then secondary formation of I2˙−. When 100 mM TBAPF6 was present in dichloromethane solution, the appearance of [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ could be time resolved much like that in acetonitrile.

A time resolved PL decay monitored at 620 nm (green) is included for comparison. B) Pseudo-first-order rate constants, kobs, plotted as a function of [I−]free. 
A similar kinetic analysis was performed for experimental data found in dichloromethane with and without TBAPF6 present. Fig. 6B shows the observed rate constants measured without TBAPF6 present as a function of [I−]free. Interestingly, the second-order rate constants obtained for 425 nm matched that of excited state quenching given above within experimental error; k425 A = 1.6 ± 0.3 × 1010 M−1s−1, k425 B = 1.2 ± 0.5 × 1010 M−1s−1. Measurements at 408 nm were well described by a first-order kinetic model and yielded the second-order rate constant k408 = 1.4 ± 0.3 × 1010 M−1s−1. When 100 mM TBAPF6 was present, all wavelengths were described by first-order kinetics and their second-order rate constants converged to that observed for excited state quenching; k540 = 3.2 ± 0.3 × 109 M−1s−1, k425 = 2.5 ± 0.1 × 109 M−1s−1, k408 = 3.1 ± 0.2 × 109 M−1s−1. Table 2 provides a summary of all second-order rate constants reported above for both solvents.

Comparative ESI-MS experiments were conducted on 5 μM [Ru(deeb)3](PF6)2 solutions in both acetonitrile and dichloromethane. A strong peak at m/z 501 was observed in both spectra and was identified as the parent ion for [Ru(deeb)3]2+. This peak was present with an ion distribution pattern characteristic of the isotopic distribution of ruthenium, thus aiding in identification of m/z peaks associated with the parent compound. Also present in both spectra was a characteristic peak at m/z 1147, assigned to the 1:1 [Ru(deeb)3]PF6+ ion pair. Fig. 7 shows positive ion mode mass spectra in the range of the m/z 1147 peak for both acetonitrile and dichloromethane solutions. We note the difference in ion intensity for the two solvents and attribute this to the lower relative permittivity of dichloromethane (εr = 9) compared with that of acetonitrile (εr = 35), leading to an increased probability for ionic association. When an equal concentration of TBAI was added to each solution, a new characteristic peak at m/z 1129 was observed concomitant with a loss of ion intensity for m/z 1147. This new peak was assigned to the [Ru(deeb)3]I+ ion pair, Fig. 7 inset.

Insets show mass spectra obtained after a 1:1 addition of TBAI to solution. The new peak at m/z 1129 is assigned to the [Ru(deeb)3]I+ ion pair. 

Single crystal X-ray diffraction of [Ru(deeb)3]I2 isolated from acetonitrile solution revealed that the two iodide anions were well separated in the solid state, Fig. 8. In fact, each iodide was positioned opposite one another across the bipyridyl plane of a deeb ligand. This was unlike what had been observed previously with [Ru(bpy)2(deeb)]I2, where a strong interaction between iodide and the ethyl ester groups of the deeb ligand led to close association of the two iodides.8 It should also be noted that there was some difficulty resolving the position of one of the ethyl ester groups of [Ru(deeb)3]I2.

Discussion
Excited state quenching in acetonitrile
Quenching of [Ru(deeb)3]2+* in acetonitrile solution by iodide was found to be governed by a dynamic mechanism. This type of quenching is described by diffusion of an excited state molecule and iodide to form an encounter complex followed by chemical reaction (i.e.electron transfer) that deactivates the excited state, Scheme 1.20 The observed quenching rate constant, kq = 4.8 × 1010 M−1s−1, therefore contains contributions from diffusion and electron transfer.20,21
 Scheme 1 
Transient absorption measurements provided strong evidence that excited state quenching was due to reductive electron transfer from I− to [Ru(deeb)3]2+* that yielded the reduced ruthenium compound, [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+. Specifically, Table 2 shows that second-order rate constants for [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ growth and [Ru(deeb)3]2+* decay were coincident with one another, and near the diffusion limit (i.e. 1010 M−1s−1). We have reported previously that the excited state quenching of [Ru(bpz)2(deeb)]2+* by I− is also a diffusion limited reaction. In this example, the excited state reduction potential, Eo(Ru2+*/+), was sufficiently positive such that the driving force for iodide oxidation to the iodine atom was roughly −0.4 V. This is expected to be the case with [Ru(deeb)3]2+* as well, where Eo(Ru2+*/+) = +1.28 V (vs.SCE). Using the acetonitrile estimate for Eo(I˙/−) = +0.99 V (vs.SCE) (converted from +0.60 V vs.Fe(Cp)2+/0),22 we obtain ΔGo = −0.29 V, that could indeed provide the driving force needed for a reaction near the diffusion limit.
A small decrease (< 5%) in the initial amplitude of the time resolved photoluminescence decay suggested that a small fraction of excited state molecules may have been quenched within ion pairs. No evidence for ion pair formation could be found by visible spectroscopy; however, ESI-MS experiments revealed m/z peaks assigned to [Ru(deeb)3]PF6+ and [Ru(deeb)3]I+ ion pairs. In these studies, [Ru(deeb)3]I+ was observed upon addition of iodide to solution concurrent with a decrease in [Ru(deeb)3]PF6+ intensity. The fact that there was no spectroscopic evidence for the [Ru(deeb)3]I+ ion pair could be an indication that loose, solvent-separated ion pairs exist in acetonitrile.23–25 These species therefore may not interact sufficiently to result in measurable charge transfer character, but their slight degree of association may be adequate to yield gas phase ions during desolvation in the electrospray process.
Excited state quenching in dichloromethane
Excited state quenching of [Ru(deeb)3]2+* by I− was shown to occur more effectively in dichloromethane solvent than in acetonitrile. This was due to a static excited state electron transfer reaction identified by a significant decrease in the initial amplitude of the photoluminescence decay with iodide addition. This reaction is proposed to occur within [Ru(deeb)3]I+ ion pairs that react immediately upon light absorption, Scheme 1. Evidence for ion pairs in solution was obtained with both UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and ESI-MS.
Significant changes in the ground state absorption spectrum of [Ru(deeb)3]2+ observed upon iodide addition indicated a strong interaction between the ruthenium compound and iodide. The spectral changes may result from a perturbation of the manifold of MLCT excited states and/or direct outer-sphere charge transfer interactions. Ion pair charge transfer (IPCT) bands in the near-UV/visible region have been reported in the literature and can be evaluated with eqn (7).13,14,23,26 Analogous to inter-valence charge transfer like that of the Creutz–Taube ion,27,28 the IPCT transition energy, ΔEIPCT, contains contributions from the free energy for electron transfer, ΔGet, and the reorganization energy, λ; but also factors in the free energy of forming the ion-pair, ΔGIP. For the [Ru(deeb)3]I+ ion pair, an electron would be directly transferred from I− to [Ru(deeb)3]2+ upon excitation into the IPCT absorption band and therefore ground state redox potentials are applied to calculate ΔGet = −(Eo(RuII/+) − Eo(I˙/−)) = +1.95 eV. Using Keq = 2.30 × 105 M−1 abstracted from photoluminescence quenching data we obtain ΔGIP = −0.32 eV. Finally, assuming a standard λ = 1.0 eV, an estimate of ΔEIPCT = 3.27 eV or ∼380 nm was calculated that is in good agreement with the experimental data. Therefore, the absorption feature that increases with iodide concentration at wavelengths < 450 nm is tentatively assigned as a direct ion pair charge transfer band between [Ru(deeb)3]2+ and iodide.  ΔEIPCT = ΔGet + λ − ΔGIP(7)

ESI-MS experiments provided direct observation of gas phase ion pairs in the form of [Ru(deeb)3]PF6+ and [Ru(deeb)3]I+, much like in acetonitrile. However, in dichloromethane the ion intensities for the two m/z peaks were larger than those in the corresponding solvent and suggested that loose ion pairs which collapse during desolvation in the electrospray process could not be the sole cause of this result. Therefore it appears that tight ion pairs were present in dichloromethane.
A detailed Stern–Volmer analysis of the photoluminescence amplitude quenching data yielded an equilibrium constant for the formation of the 1:1 Ru:I ion pair, Keq = 2.30 ± 0.03 × 105 M−1. It is of interest to note that a separate model was proposed that included a second equilibrium which yielded a 2:1 iodide:ruthenium adduct. This type of adduct was proposed to exist in the previous [Ru(bpy)2(deeb)]2+ example and lead to direct formation of I2˙− upon light absorption.8 Implementation of this model to the current data; however, resulted in a convergence to the same Keq reported in Fig. 4. Therefore, the Stern–Volmer data are most consistent with ion pairs that involve a single iodide.
The magnitude of the estimated equilibrium constant is not surprising given the low relative permittivity of dichloromethane (εr = 9). The solvent is not able to shield the electrostatic forces present between these ions and thus their association is expected. Given this explanation, the equilibrium constant should be dependent on the ionic strength of the solution where increased ionic strength will yield a smaller Keq.25 In the current study, a full analysis of this dependence was not performed. Nevertheless, the gross excess addition of TBAPF6 (100 mM) to solutions did lead to complete loss of static quenching and no evidence for ion pairing in the ground state absorption spectrum.
In addition to simple electrostatic attraction, previous studies have shown that the ethyl ester groups of the deeb ligand may act as specific iodide binding sites. The X-ray crystal structure of [Ru(bpy)2(deeb)]I2 revealed that the iodide anions were located < 3 Å from the carbonyl carbons of each ethyl ester group and ∼6 Å from each other.8 In addition, a large equilibrium constant of 5.97 × 104 M−1 was obtained for this compound in dichloromethane. X-ray crystallographic data for [Ru(deeb)3]I2 revealed that the two iodide anions were on opposite sides of a single deeb ligand and not as closely associated with the ethyl ester groups as those of the previous example. Oddly enough the equilibrium constant estimated for [Ru(deeb)3]2+ is roughly four times larger than that of [Ru(bpy)2(deeb)]2+. Therefore when three deeb ligands were present the number of binding sites and thus the probability of ion pair formation increased; however, it appears there may have been a loss in specific coordination of iodide anions.
Transient absorption revealed that [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ appeared within 10 ns and therefore confirmed that electron transfer was the mode of static excited state deactivation. The driving force for the excited state reaction is expected to be similar in dichloromethane and acetonitrile; however, we note that no report of Eo(I˙/−) in dichloromethane exists in the literature. This reduction potential changes ∼100 mV when comparing water and acetonitrile, and thus we expect a similar deviation when going to dichloromethane.29 Regardless of these differences, oxidation of iodide within ion pairs is achievable with [Ru(deeb)3]2+.

Dynamic excited state quenching in dichloromethane is also proposed to yield [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ like that observed for acetonitrile. However, no growth component for the reduced compound could be observed after the laser pulse even though excited state quenching was near diffusion limit. This could be attributed to a low cage escape yield for the dynamic reaction in dichloromethane, where the excited state is deactivated by electron transfer but recombination within the solvent cage results in ground state products.
Mechanism of I–I bond formation
As shown in Scheme 1 above, the reaction between [Ru(deeb)3]2+* and I− is proposed to yield iodine atoms by two mechanisms. In acetonitrile, iodine atoms are produced predominantly by a dynamic mechanism whereas in dichloromethane they are formed through a static pathway. Pulse-radiolysis studies have established that I˙ reacts with I− to form I2˙− at a near diffusion limited rate in aqueous and organic solvent.3–6 Therefore the formation of I2˙− is expected when iodine atoms are present.
In both solvents, the growth of I2˙− could be time resolved and kinetic analyses yielded similar second-order rate constants, 2.2 ± 0.2 × 1010 M−1s−1 (CH3CN) and 1.3 ± 0.4 × 1010 M−1s−1 (CH2Cl2). In acetonitrile, this rate constant was roughly two times slower than that for the appearance of [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ and indicated that an iodine atom intermediate was likely to be present. The rate constant for I2˙− formation was within experimental error the same as other reports for the reaction of I˙ with I− in acetonitrile.3,4,6 In dichloromethane, [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ and I˙ were produced within 10 ns and thus the growth of I2˙− was observed as iodine atoms reacted away with excess iodide anions. To the best of our knowledge no report of this reaction in dichloromethane has appeared in the literature; however, reports in various solvents suggests that its rate constant is relatively inert to changes in solvent polarity.5,6 Therefore the rate constant determined in this study is a reasonable estimate for the reaction of I˙ and I− in dichloromethane. When 100 mM TBAPF6 was present in dichloromethane solution, the formation of diiodide was rate limited by the production of iodine atoms. Under these conditions, no static excited state quenching was observed and therefore the production of I2˙− could only be attributed to iodine atoms formed by dynamic excited state quenching.
Relevance to solar energy conversion
The need to focus solar energy research on systems that store energy in the form of chemical bonds has been duly noted.2 At the same time, more cost effective means of harvesting solar photons is considered an equally important challenge.2,16,30 To meet these demands, fundamental studies on iodide photo-redox chemistry can provide molecular details for how solar photons might be directly converted to chemical bonds.
In the current study, we have shown that I–I bonds are formed viaiodide oxidation by the excited state ruthenium compound, [Ru(deeb)3]2+*, in both acetonitrile and dichloromethane. In both solvents, reaction of [Ru(deeb)3]2+* and I− results in [Ru(deeb−)(deeb)2]+ and I˙. The iodine atom then reacts near the diffusion limit with iodide to yield I2˙−. Interestingly, ion pairing in dichloromethane leads to more effective excited state quenching than in acetonitrile. This result suggests that outer-sphere photo-redox reactions may be enhanced by operation in non-polar solvents. This idea is not new to the field of chemistry,8,14 yet we note that when these photo-redox reactions yield chemical bonds, like in the case of iodide photo-oxidation, storage of solar energy is achieved. In the current example, the I–I bonded species diiodide is not an ideal fuel as it is prone to disproportionate,17,29 yet the fundamental model of an accessible bond formation reaction has implications for the development of catalysts that can generate H–H and O–O bonds required for water splitting.2
Studies of iodide photo-redox chemistry are also important to the function of high efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells. Within these cells iodide and triiodide represent the most efficient redox mediator to date with light-to-electrical power conversion > 11%.16 The general roles of I−/I3− are becoming more well understood and have been the subject of recent review type articles.17,29 The success of the mediator is thought to lie in its ability to generate chemical bonds upon the oxidation of iodide. This unique feature allows for efficient charge separation in dye-sensitized solar cells that results in maximum efficiency. The mechanistic details of bond formation within these devices, however, are a debatable topic. Therefore, fundamental studies on what variables may influence the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for these reactions are of continued interest to the scientific community.
Experimental
Materials

          Argon gas (Mattson, 99.99%), [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2˙6H2O (Aldrich, 99.95%), tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI; Fluka, >99%), tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6; Fluka, >99.0%), triethanolamine (TEA; Fisher, 99.9%), dichloromethane (EMD, HPLC grade), and acetonitrile (Burdick & Jackson, spectroscopic grade) were used without further purification. [Ru(deeb)3](PF6)2 was prepared by a literature method.31

X-ray crystallography

Diffraction quality single crystals of [Ru(deeb)3]I2 were grown from a nearly saturated acetonitrile solution of 10:1 molar ratio TBAI:[Ru(deeb)3](PF6)2 by vapor diffusion of ether for 3 days. The X-ray intensity data were measured at 110 K on an Oxford Diffraction Xcalibur3 system equipped with a graphite monochromator and a CCD detector as described elsewhere.8
Electrochemistry

Reduction potentials for [Ru(deeb)3](PF6)2 were determined by cyclic voltammetry in acetonitrile and dichloromethane solvent as previously described.31

Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry


ESI-MS experiments were conducted on a Finnigan LCQ Duo ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) in positive ion mode. For sample preparation, [Ru(deeb)3](PF6)2 and TBAI were dissolved separately in either acetonitrile or dichloromethane and purged with argon gas for 20 min. Samples were introduced into the instrument at a rate of 25 uL min−1 using a syringe pumpvia a silica capillary line. The heated capillary temperature was 250 °C and the spray voltage was 5kV.
Photophysical measurements
Steady-state UV-visible absorption measurements were acquired on a Varian Cary 50 UV–Vis spectrophotometer at room temperature. Room temperature steady-state photoluminescence spectra were measured on a SPEX Fluorolog calibrated with a standard NIST tungsten-halogen lamp. Time resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption difference spectra were acquired as previously described.32 Samples were excited by a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (BigSky Brilliant B, 8 ns fwhm, 1 Hz) tuned to 532 nm using the frequency double of the 1064 nm primary laser line. At a right angle to the pump, a Xenon arc lamp (150 W, Applied Photophysics) was pulsed. The light from the lamp was collected into a monochromator (Spex 1702/04 spectrometer) equipped with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector. The signal from the PMT was sent to an oscilloscope (LeCroy 9450, Dual 350 MHz) and averaged (60–200 shots) to collect each kinetic measurement. For Stern–Volmer quenching studies nanosecond time resolved photoluminescence was collected by blocking the white light probe beam and monitoring the photoluminescence at 620 nm at a right angle to the excitation. Within a given experiment the PMT voltage, slit width, and laser pump power were held constant. Pump power was measured by a thermopile power meter. All measurements were made at room temperature under an argon atmosphere achieved by purging the solutions with argon gas for 20 min.
Appendix
An equation for [I−]free was derived based upon mass balances for [Ru(deeb)3]2+ and iodide using a 1:1 equilibrium model. The equation for [I−]free was then substituted into eqn (5) to yield eqn (6).
