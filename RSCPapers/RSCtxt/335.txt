    , Accepted 30th June 2019First published on 1st July 2019AbstractThe construction of the hierarchical nanostructures of inorganic materials with high stability has attracted great attention for photothermal therapy. In this paper, we presented the preparation of urchin-like LaWO4Cl nanostructures assembled with nanoribbons via a facile solvothermal reaction. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the formation of good crystalline urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the element composition of the prepared urchin-like nanostructures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations showed that the urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies were composed of single crystalline nanoribbons with diameters less than 10 nm. When excited with an 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) laser at the power density of 1.91 W cm−2 for 5 min, the temperature quickly increased to 52 °C. The in vitro cytotoxicity of urchin-like LaWO4Cl was tested with human cervical cancer cells (HeLa), revealing excellent biocompatibility. More importantly, the photothermal treatment with urchin-like LaWO4Cl displayed great therapeutic efficacy in vitro. Thus, urchin-like LaWO4Cl would be a new promising NIR light-driven photothermal agent, which can also pave a new way for the material design of PTT agents.
Introduction
Developing near-infrared (NIR) photothermal enhancement materials is of great significance for applications in many related scientific areas such as photocatalytic reactions, solar cells, and photothermal therapy.1–8 Nanostructured transition metal oxides have attracted considerable attention due to their physical properties and technological applications. The development of tungstate nanomaterials has helped solve the above-mentioned scientific predicament due to their excellent and reliable NIR absorptive properties.9–15 However, under the condition of high temperature, the loss of oxygen defects results in the degradation of photothermal properties. Therefore, alkali metal ions such as Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs are doped into WO3.16–18 However, in this regard, WO3 doped with Cs and Rb is not suitable for photothermal therapy due to the poor biocompatibility of Cs and Rb, which may result in unpredictable systemic toxicity.19 LaWO4Cl is a very important class of hybrid compounds, and it shows great performances in luminescence because the tungstate group exhibits trigonal bipyramidal geometry.20,21 To date, only few studies have been reported on the preparation and application of LaWO4Cl and there is no report concerning its photothermal properties.
In this work, we reported a novel and simple strategy for synthesizing and analyzing the photothermal effects of LaWO4Cl with a hierarchical urchin-like nanostructure assembled by single crystalline nanoribbons. As far as we know, this is the first work that has reported the 3D chloro-tungstate hierarchical nanostructure as a promising photothermal agent. Moreover, it described the assembling of surfactant-free nanoribbons using a facile solvothermal method, which made the composite stable in solutions. The urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies with excellent biocompatibility and high photothermal performances showed great potential in cancer photo-chemotherapy.
Materials and methods
Materials
All the chemicals were used without further purification. Lanthanum sesquioxide (La2O3, 99.0%), tungsten chloride (WCl6, 99.0%), and 1-butanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.
Synthesis of urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies
The urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies were synthesized by a solvothermal reaction. In a typical experiment, La2O3 was first suspended in a solution containing 200 mg WCl6 (purity 99.9%, Aldrich) and 30 mL 1-butanol (1-butanol was dehydrated by 4A zeolite). The suspension was put into a 50 mL autoclave, sealed and maintained at 200 °C for 24 h and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The precipitates were centrifuged, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and then dried at 60 °C for 6 h.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) was performed on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA over the range of 10–70 degree. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with a JSM-6700F electron microscope. High-resolution TEM imaging was carried out on a Tecnai G2 S-Twin F20 electron microscope operated at 200 kV.
Photothermal conversion property test
To measure the photothermal effect of the urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies, 1000 μL of aqueous dispersions of the urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies with various concentrations (i.e., 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mg) was irradiated by an 808 nm laser at a power density of 1.91 W cm−2. The working distance was 15 cm, and the spot area was 0.79 cm2. A temperature logger was used to monitor the temperature change. For the photo-stability test, the dispersions were irradiated by the laser for 5 min and then cooled naturally. The process was repeated 4 times. The photothermal conversion efficiency of the sample was calculated by following the Roper's method.22

In vitro cytotoxicity
HeLa cells were first seeded into 96-well cell culture plates at a density of 8 × 103 cells per well; then, they were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at various concentrations (0, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 μg mL−1) of urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies for 24 h. As photothermal therapy control, the cells were irradiated for 10 min using an 808 nm laser with output power density of 1.91 W cm−2. The cell viability was measured using the MTT assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. All tests were independently performed three times.

In vitro photothermal therapy
HeLa cells were plated in a 96-well plate at a density of 10000 cells per mL in DMEM containing 10% serum at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 for 24 h prior to treatment. After 12 h of incubation, DMEM was taken out from the wells, and the cells were washed for three times with the PBS solution. The nanoparticles of the urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies (500 μg mL−1) dispersed in the PBS solution were then added into the wells and incubated for 4 h. Next, the cells were irradiated for 5 min, 10 min, and 15 min using an 808 nm laser with output power density of 1.91 W cm−2. Subsequently, the PBS dispersion of the urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies was removed, and the remaining cells were washed with the PBS solution three times. To differentiate the dead cells, HeLa cells were co-stained by a solution mixture (0.8 mL) containing calcein-AM (2 mmol L−1) and PI (4 mmol L−1) and observed using an Olympus IX53 microscope.
Results and discussion
Characterization of urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies

Fig. 1a displays the SEM images of the as-synthesized sample. The low-magnification image indicates that the particles have uniform sphere-like morphology, with size of about 1 μm, as shown in the inset image. The high-magnification SEM image of the sample clearly shows that a single particle consists of ultra-thin nanoribbons. All nanoribbons were oriented in such a way that they assembled into an urchin-like sphere. Interestingly, the sphere was observed to be composed of two parts, and it had an obvious gap. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were used to confirm the crystal structures and the chemical composition of the as-prepared sample. All diffraction peaks matched the reflections of the phase of urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies (JCPDS no. 36-0653), as shown in Fig. 1b. No impurity peaks were observed, confirming the high purity of the sample. Some diffraction peaks of the sample were sharper than the others, indicating their high crystallinity in some directions. Thus, this result implies the one-dimensional structure of the sample, which is consistent with the morphology of nanoribbons in the SEM images. The EDS result in Fig. S1† also confirms the high purity of the sample. The atom ratio of La, W, and Cl was 9.68:12.77:10.37; the value was about 1:1:1 for the urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies. These results suggest that the urchin-like spheres are assembled by nanoribbons with high purity and crystallinity.

Furthermore, TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, shown in Fig. 2, were captured to explore the detailed assembly process of the nanostructure and the crystal structure. Fig. 2 provides an overview of single urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies. The urchin-like sphere has a diameter of 700–800 nm and consists of many rigid nanoribbons, as shown in Fig. 2a. The image shows an intermediate state, which has not yet overgrown. When the nanoribbons continue overgrowing, the intermediate disappears gradually and eventually forms 3D unprecedented conformations, which is consistent with the results of SEM (Fig. 1a). The higher magnification image in Fig. 2b exhibits the presence of the urchin-like sphere consisting of nanoribbons with diameter less than 10 nm. Thus, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images suggest that each nanoribbon is a single crystal elongated along the two (002) and (120) facets, as shown in Fig. 2(c and d).

To further investigate the surface chemical composition and states, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to characterize the sample. Fig. S2(a)† presents the survey scan that indicates the main elements of urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies in the sample. There was no impurity other than carbon. The atom ratio of the elements La, W, and Cl was 8.22:17.82:14.94; this result is in accordance with the EDS results. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of W (Fig. S2(b))† demonstrates complex energy distribution. The fitted spectrum exhibits two peaks corresponding to the oxidation states of W atoms. The peaks at 35.8 eV and 37.9 eV belonged to the W atoms having a 6+ oxidation state.
Photothermal performances of urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies
In the investigation of the potential of urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies in photothermal ablation therapy of cancer, a laser with 808 nm wavelength was used. Under continuous irradiation of the 808 nm laser with power density of 1.91 W cm−2, the temperature elevation of aqueous dispersions containing urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies at different concentrations (0–4 mg mL−1) was measured, as shown in Fig. 3a. The control experiment demonstrated that the temperature of pure water (without urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies) only increased by less than 6.0 °C from room temperature (20.1 °C) in 10 min. With the addition of the urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies (i.e., 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mg mL−1), the temperature of the aqueous dispersion increased by 5.2–26.3 °C after 10 min of irradiation, as shown in Fig. 3b, indicating that urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies can rapidly and efficiently convert the 808 nm-wavelength laser energy into heat energy resulting from strong photoabsorption at 808 nm.

(b) Temperature elevation of pure water and the sample (0–4.0 mg mL−1) under the irradiation of 808 nm laser. (c) Temperature elevation over four LASER ON/OFF cycles of 808 nm laser irradiation. (d) Plots of the cooling time versus the negative natural logarithm of driving force temperature. 
We subsequently investigated the photo-stability of the urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies by using four cycles of LASER ON/OFF with an 808 nm laser having power density of 1.91 W cm−2. The aqueous dispersion of the urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies was irradiated with an 808 nm laser for 10 min (LASER ON, Fig. 3c), followed by naturally cooling to room temperature for 30 min (without irradiation, LASER OFF). As shown in Fig. 3c, the temperature elevation of 47.9–50.0 °C is achieved over the four LASER ON states for 3 mg mL−1 urchin-like LaWO4Cl assembly solution, which indicated that the urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies also show higher photothermal conversion efficiency under the irradiation of an 808 nm laser.
We then measured the photothermal transduction efficiencies of the urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies (3 mg mL−1) by a modified method, which was similar to a method reported by Roper.22 The nanoparticle dispersions were continuously illuminated by an 808 nm laser with the same power density of 1.91 W cm−2 until the increase in the temperature resulted in a steady-state. The irradiation source was then shut off, and the temperature was monitored to determine the rate of heat transfer from the system. According to the obtained data (Fig. 3d), the 808 nm laser heat conversion efficiency of the urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies was calculated to be 57.1%.
Good biocompatibility is an indispensable requirement for the biomedical applications of photothermal agents. We used an MTT assay to quantify the viability of HeLa cells after incubation with the urchin-like LaWO4Cl dispersions at various concentrations (31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 μg mL−1) for 24 h. It was found that in all the cases, the cell viability was maintained around 90% or higher (Fig. 4b), indicating the low cytotoxicity of the urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies. The cells were also treated with 808 nm laser irradiation having power density of 1.91 W cm−2 for 10 min (Fig. 4b) as a control. The control group showed low cell viability (>90%) at each concentration.

Motivated by the high photothermal conversion capability of urchin-like LaWO4Cl, we studied its photothermal therapy effect on cancer cell ablation. HeLa cells cultured in 96-well plates were exposed to the 808 nm laser for 5, 10 or 15 min immediately after the addition of urchin-like LaWO4Cl (500 μg mL−1, 0.02 mL per well). An inverted fluorescence microscope was used to distinguish the live cells (green) from the dead ones (red) after staining the cells using calcein-AM and PI. We observed the photothermal ablation of HeLa cells after 5 min irradiation of the 808 nm laser in the presence of urchin-like LaWO4Cl nanoparticles. Upon increasing the irradiation time to 15 min, severe cell death was induced (Fig. 4a). These results directly support the fact that urchin-like LaWO4Cl can act as a highly effective photothermal agent with powerful photothermal therapy efficacy on cancer cell ablation. Given its high biocompatibility, stability and photothermal capability, this urchin-like LaWO4Cl may hold a promising potential for clinical antitumor treatments.
Conclusions
In summary, hierarchical urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies composed of nanoribbons were prepared by a facile solvothermal method. The diameter of the prepared nanoribbon was less than 10 nm. As building blocks, the nanoribbons were found to exist as single crystals. The TEM and high-resolution SEM images proved the formation of urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies, which demonstrated strong photothermal conversion efficiency under 808 nm laser irradiation. The conversion efficiency of the urchin-like LaWO4Cl assemblies was calculated to be 57.1%. The relatively high value was possibly due to the special hierarchical nanostructures. Urchin-like LaWO4Cl exhibited excellent biocompatibility to human cervical cancer cells (HeLa). The photothermal treatment with urchin-like LaWO4Cl displayed great therapeutic efficacy in vitro. Therefore, the good NIR-responding photothermal performance of the materials shows their promising potentials in biomedical applications.
