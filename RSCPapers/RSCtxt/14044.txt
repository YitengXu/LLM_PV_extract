    , Accepted 11th September 2014First published on 11th September 2014AbstractWe report here the synthesis, electrochemical and photophysical properties of a series of novel exTTF-based organic dyes (3 and 7a,b) as well as their application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In the three designed dyes, the electron-donor exTTF group is connected to the rhodanine-3-acetic acid electron-acceptor unit through vinyl or vinyl-thiophene spacers. The electrochemical studies showed that the energy gap between the LUMO level of the dyes and the TiO2 conduction band decreases with the length of the conjugated system. As a consequence, the power conversion efficiencies of organic DSSCs fabricated with these dyes scale inversely with their light-harvesting ability.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received widespread interest for transferring clean solar energy into electricity, and have become a new promising alternative to conventional solar cells.1 In a typical DSSC device, light is absorbed by a monolayer of organic dye molecules anchored on the TiO2 surface and then electrons are injected from the excited dye into the conduction band of the TiO2, thus generating electric current.2
The interest in metal-free organic sensitizers has grown in the last few years since they have high molar absorption coefficients, due to intramolecular π–π* transitions, and are easily modified due to relatively short synthetic routes.3 In this regard, a great deal of research aiming at finding highly efficient and stable organic sensitizers has recently been performed and a wide number of new molecules involving triphenylamine,4 porphyrin,5 coumarin,6 and perylene7 derivatives have been described as novel organic sensitizers.
The research on tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and its π-extended derivatives (exTTFs) as electron donors in DSSCs has been limited compared with the results considering the above mentioned electron-donor systems.8 exTTF-based organic dyes have shown an interesting behaviour and moderate power conversion efficiency (η), due to thermodynamically unfavourable dye-regeneration after electron-injection.9 However, in recent results, dithiafulvene-based D–π–A10 or annulated TTF–acceptor systems11 have led to very good power conversion efficiencies (6.5–8.3%).
Inspired by these results, in this paper we report the synthesis and characterization of three novel exTTF-based dyes (Scheme 1), endowed with a rhodanine 3-acetic acid unit as the electron-acceptor and their further application as sensitizers in DSSCs. In our design, exTTF-based aldehydes with different extensions of conjugation were connected to the active methylene of rhodanine 3-acetic acid through Knoevenagel condensation. The prepared molecules (3 and 7a,b) were fully characterized by different spectroscopic methods and their optical, electrochemical and photophysical properties investigated considering experimental (absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry) and theoretical (DFT calculations) methods. The experimental findings from the devices prepared reveal the strong impact that the modification of the π-conjugated bridge has on the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
As shown in Scheme 1, the target dyes 3 and 7a,b were obtained by a Knoevenagel reaction of the aldehydes 212 or 5a,b and rhodanine 3-acetic acid 6 in moderate yields (49–55%). Aldehydes 5a,b were prepared by the Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction of compound 2 with the corresponding diethyl 5-(1,3-dioxan-2-yl)-2-thienylmethyl phosphonate (4)13 in good yields (77–83%). The red solids were fully characterized using NMR, IRTF, UV-Vis and MS spectrometry. The presence of the formyl group is clearly detected at 9.86 ppm in the 1H NMR, at 183.7–183.0 ppm in the 13C NMR, as well as by its stretching CO band at 1658 cm−1 in the FTIR.
The target molecules 3 and 7a,b exhibit a much lower solubility in common organic solvents than their precursors. As a general feature of these compounds, the signal corresponding to the methylene protons of rhodanine-3-acetic acid is observed at high fields (δ = 4.10 to 4.80 ppm). The structures were also confirmed by HRMS MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (see the Experimental section).
Optical properties
The absorption spectra of exTTF dyes (3, 7a,b) in chloroform are shown in Fig. 1. The well-known absorptions of exTTF are observed in the 400–440 nm visible region.14 Additionally, new absorption features are observed in the red part of the spectrum (starting from 500 nm). These low energy absorptions are assigned to charge transfer transitions involving the electron-donor exTTF and the electron-acceptor rhodanine 3-acetic acid moieties. Note that the above absorption bands are red-shifted and gradually increase their molar absorption coefficients (ε) ranging from 5449 to 28000 M−1 cm−1 (see Table 1), with the enhancement in the π-conjugation in the dyes.

The emission spectra for the new dyes 3, 7a and 7b in solution were obtained by exciting at 370, 390 and 451 nm, respectively, which correspond to the wavelength of excitation where the compounds have the maximal emission. The emission spectra reflect the extended electronic conjugation upon moving from 3 to 7a and 7b (Fig. 1).15 The emission bands of the dyes are structured with one distinct emission maximum and shift bathochromically with the increasing conjugation in the dyes.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemistry of exTTF aldehydes (5a,b), target molecules (3, 7a,b) and the reference 2-[9-(1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene)anthracen-10(9H)-yilidene]-1,3-dithiole (exTTF) were investigated using cyclic voltammetry in CH3CN at room temperature. An Ag/AgNO3 electrode was used as the reference, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a glassy carbon was employed as the working electrode (see Table 2). The exTTF compounds exhibit a single two-electron chemically reversible oxidation process to form the dicationic state.16 For all exTTF compounds the oxidation potentials are very close (+43 to −15 mV) and both the anodic peak potential (Epa) and the cathodic peak potential (Epc) values are a function of the scan rate and the temperature, resulting in an electrochemically irreversible oxidation process, a consequence of the coalescence of the first and second electron oxidations into a single two-electron wave. This oxidation process is accompanied by a drastic geometric change, from a highly distorted butterfly-like geometry in the neutral state to a planar aromatic hydrocarbon skeleton in the dicationic state.17 In the systems with the longest extended conjugation (5b and 7b) and additional irreversible oxidation process, most probably due to the thiophenevinylene units, is observed at +850 and +781 mV, respectively. The exTTF derivatives connected to rhodanine-3-acetic acid (3 and 7a,b) retain the anodic electrochemical pattern of exTTF. However, the irreversible oxidation potentials are, in general, shifted to less negative values when compared to those of the reference exTTF (Table 2). On the reduction scan, very weak irreversible processes are detected at −1471 mV (3), −1379 mV (7a) and −1343 mV (7b). These reductions could be due to the conjugated system connected to the exTTF and, not surprisingly, chain lengthening promotes a decrease in these reduction potentials.

For device fabrication, the electronic levels of the HOMO (Eox) and LUMO (Ered) should match the conduction band level of the semiconductor electrode and the iodine redox potential. The HOMO level ranging from −5.09 to −5.12 eV is more negative than the I−/I3 redox couple (−4.90 eV), which provides a driving force for dye regeneration through the recapture of the injected electrons from I− by the dye cation radical (Table 3). The energy gap between the LUMO level of the dyes and the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−3.90 eV)18 should be at least 0.2 eV for an efficient electron injection. The Egap ranging from 0.30 to 0.17 eV for the exTTF-based dyes 3 and 7a,b are very close to the limiting driving forces. In the case of 7b, this driving force is not sufficiently large to warrantee an effective electron injection.

Electronic structure: theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to shed light on the electronic structure of the novel exTTF-based organic dyes, using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs. The geometries of the final compounds were optimized using a B3LYP/6.31G(d,p) functional.19
Interestingly, the geometrical arrangement around the double-bond between the donor exTTF and the thiophene ring consists of a trans disposition which shows a dihedral angle of approximately 180°. The compounds show a quasi-planar thiophene–rhodadine union, which should facilitate the electronic communication along the molecule through the thiophene wire. As expected, the ground state energies of the calculated dyes decrease upon increasing the π-conjugation. We have also calculated the transition state energies by means of a self-consistent field (SCF) method and conductor polarized continuum model (CPCM) in chloroform as the solvent. The HOMO is mainly localized on the electron-donor moiety and the LUMO is mainly localized on the electron-acceptor unit of rhodanine-3-acetic acid with a small bridge contribution (Fig. 2).

Interestingly, there is an overlap of HOMO and LUMO orbitals along the bridge, thus facilitating the electronic communication between the donor and acceptor moieties. The orbital energy calculations showed that the novel exTTF-based dyes have HOMO levels below the iodine redox couple level (−4.9 eV) to ensure the efficient regeneration of the oxidized dye by the triiodide in the electrolyte. The orbital LUMO levels are more positive than the conduction band level of the semiconductor (−3.9 eV) which, in principle, should be a sufficient driving force for the injection of the photoexcited electrons into the TiO2 conduction band.
The lowest transitions for all compounds are listed in Table 4 in order to gain insight into the excited states of the dyes. The lowest transition for each dye is calculated to be at 2.78 eV (3), 2.61 eV (7a) and 2.39 eV (7b), corresponding to a charge-transfer excitation of the HOMO to the LUMO. The differences between absorption maximum from the theory and the experiments are related to the self-interaction error in TDDFT arising through the electron transfer in the extended charge-transfer state.4b,20 In the case of dye 3, it can be observed that the band experimentally found at 2.21 eV (560 nm) seems to be composed by a transition with character of charge transfer with an oscillator strength of 0.5035 and the band at 2.88 eV (430 nm) appears to be principally composed by a transition of different composition from the HOMO − 3 to the LUMO and the HOMO − 1 to the LUMO, with energy values of 3.32 and 3.33 eV, respectively. The transition from the HOMO − 1 to the LUMO has a calculated oscillator strength of 0.6215, showing that this transition is more probable and corresponds to the λAbsmax detected at 372 nm (Table 1). Dye 7a has a band experimentally found at 430 nm that appears to be principally composed by a transition HOMO–LUMO with an oscillator strength of 1.5663. The experimental band observed at 335 nm appears to be composed by three overlapping π–π* transitions of different compositions from the HOMO − 2 to the LUMO, the HOMO to the LUMO, the HOMO − 4 to the LUMO and the HOMO to the LUMO + 1, with energy values of 3.06, 3.31 and 3.46 eV, respectively.

In the case of 7b, calculations predict that part of the absorption tail observed around 520 nm is mostly due to a photoinduced charge-transfer transition between the donor exTTF moiety and the acceptor rhodanine-3-acetic acid unit, although no other contributions are clearly predicted.
Photovoltaic properties of DSSCs
The overall solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency (η) of DSSCs prepared using the synthesized dyes is calculated from the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor of the cell (FF), and the intensity of the incident light (Pin) as follows: (1)Fig. 3 shows the corresponding photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs obtained under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation at 100 mW cm2. The photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 5.

The concentration of the dye employed for the preparation of devices was the same in the three cases, 3 × 10−4 M. Films were dipped in the respective dye for 15 hours. The photovoltaic energy conversion efficiency data show the order 7b < 7a < 3. The DSSC based on 3 shows better comprehensive properties with an open circuit voltage of 0.539 V, a short circuit photocurrent density of 3.943 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 0.745, corresponding to an overall light to electricity conversion efficiency of 1.59%.
In comparison with the reported DSSCs based on exTTF,9 the present devices show a lower photocurrent generation. The Jsc of the DSSCs increases in the order of 7b < 7a < 3; although the absorption spectrum is wider in the dyes with thiophene as a bridge. The injection efficiency and regeneration of the oxidized dye is affected, because the driving force for all dyes is very low. Most probably the quite close separation of the HOMO level of the dyes (−5.09 to −5.12 eV) and the oxidation potential for the I−/I3 redox couple with an energy of −4.9 eV, results in a lower driving force for the regeneration of the oxidized dye by iodide in the electrolyte.21,22 In addition, the low values for the Jsc could also be attributed to the lack of conjugation with the acceptor, since the coupling of the energy levels between the pigment and the TiO2 is not good. The energy gap between the LUMO level of the dyes and the conduction band edge of TiO2 are very close to the limit of driving forces (Egap ≈ 0.2 eV),6,23 in the case of 7b (Egap = 0.17 eV), and this is obviously not sufficiently large for effective electron injection leaving a low conversion efficiency (η = 0.68%).
Conclusions
We have prepared and fully characterized three novel π-extended tetrathiafulvalene-based dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells applications. From density functional theory calculations and frontier orbital analysis, it is evident that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is mainly localized on the electron-donor moiety and the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is mainly localized on the electron-acceptor unit of rhodanine-3-acetic acid with a small bridge contribution, showing a pronounced push–pull effect. Unfortunately, the low gaps between the HOMO of the dyes and the I−/I3 redox couple in one side and the LUMO level of the dyes and the conduction band of TiO2 in the other, prevent a functional operation of the dye-sensitized solar cells. Among the investigated dyes, the device constructed with 3 exhibits the best performance, with an overall power conversion efficiency of 1.59%.
Experimental section
General
All solvents were dried according to standard procedures. Reagents were used as purchased. All air-sensitive reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere. Flash chromatography was performed using silica gel (Merck, Kieselgel 60, 230–240 mesh or Scharlau 60, 230–240 mesh). Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using aluminum coated Merck Kieselgel60 F254 plates. Melting points were determined on a Sanyo Gallenkamp apparatus. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 300 (1H: 300 MHz; 13C: 75 MHz) and Bruker Avance 700 (1H: 700 MHz; 13C: 176 MHz) spectrometer at 298 K using partially deuterated solvents as internal standards. Coupling constants (J) are denoted in Hz and chemical shifts (δ) in ppm. Multiplicities are denoted as follows: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, m = multiplet, br = broad. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 (ATR device) spectrometer. UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer using CHCl3 as the solvent. Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (coupled to a Time-Of-Flight analyzer) (MALDI-TOF) experiments were recorded on a HP1100MSD spectrometer and a Bruker REF LEX spectrometer respectively.
Electrochemistry
Cyclic voltammetry was performed using an AutolabPGStat 30. A glassy carbon working electrode (Metrohm 6.0804.010) was used after being polished with alumina (0.3 μm) for 1 min, and platinum wire was used as counter electrode. An Ag/AgNO3 electrode was used as the reference. Tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) (0.1 M) was used as supporting electrolyte and dry CH3CN as the solvent. The samples were purged with argon prior to measurement. The scan rate was 100 mV s−1.
Cell fabrication

Photoanode. 
FTO glass (TEC7) was cleaned and an under layer of TiO2 was deposited by heating the substrates for 30 min at 70 °C in an aqueous solution of TiCl4. Then an 8-μm layer of transparent TiO2 was screen-printed. The paste used for this layer contained nanoparticles of 18 nm diameter. A scattering layer formed by 400 nm ∅ nanoparticles (5 μm thick) was deposited on the transparent layer. The whole structure was calcined up to 500 °C.


Sensitization. 
Solutions containing 0.3 mM of each dye in THF/EtOH (1:4) mixture were prepared. Prior to the immersion in the solutions, the photoanodes were heated to 450 °C and cooled down to 80 °C. The sensitization process lasted 15 hours.


Cell assembly. 
Twice platinized (drop casting of a solution of 8 mM hexachloroplatinic acid in n-propanol followed by heating to 410 °C for 15 min) FTO glass pieces with pre-drilled holes served as counter electrodes. They were sealed with dried sensitized photoanodes by hot-melt polymer rings (Surlyn, Dupont – 25 μm thickness). The electrolyte (1 M dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.5 M t-butylpyridine, 0.05 M lithium iodide in MeCN/s-BuCN 85:15 v/v) was driven into the device via a pre-drilled hole using a vacuum pump. The hole was sealed with a polymer and a covering glass.


Measurement. 
A 450 W xenon light source (Oriel, USA) was used to characterize the solar cells. The spectral output of the lamp was matched in the region of 350–750 nm with the aid of a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Präzisions Glas & Optik GmbH, Germany) so as to reduce the mismatch between the simulated and true solar spectra to less than 2%. The current–voltage characteristics of the cell under these conditions were obtained by applying external potential bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter (Keithley, USA). A similar data acquisition system was used to control the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements. Under computer control, light from a 300 W xenon lamp (ILC Technology, USA) was focused through a Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin Yvon Ltd., UK) onto the photovoltaic cell under test. The devices were masked to attain an illuminated active area of 0.159 cm2.

Compound 5a
To a solution of aldehyde 212 (100 mg, 0.24 mmol) and phosphonate 413 (78.4 mg, 0.24 mmol) in dry THF (20 mL) was added a solution of t-BuOK (30.1 mg, 0.27 mmol) in dry THF (10 mL) at 60 °C under an argon atmosphere, and then the mixture was stirred for 2 h at the same temperature. The mixture was washed with water, the aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane and the combined organic parts were dried over Na2SO4.
