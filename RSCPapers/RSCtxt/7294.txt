    , Accepted 21st September 2012First published on 21st September 2012AbstractHighly symmetric Co3O4 hexapods assembled by numerous porous nanorods were successfully grown on copper foil through a facile hydrothermal method followed by thermal treatment. The as-prepared Co3O4 hexapods were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Directly configured as binder-free anodes for lithium-ion batteries, the as-grown Co3O4 hexapods on copper foil exhibited a very high reversible capacity of 800 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and 440 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 even after 40 cycles. The good electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique porous structure of the Co3O4 hexapods and the good contact with Cu foil. The performance could be further improved by carbon coating, exhibiting an enhanced reversible capacity of 1001 mA h g−1 after even 40 cycles. The synthetic strategy holds the potential for large scale production of other transition metal oxides as high performance anodes for lithium-ion batteries.
Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), as a kind of electrochemical energy conversion and storage device, have been intensively explored during the past decades for the fact that they have been widely applied as power sources for portable electronic devices.1–3 Much effort has been devoted to improve the performance of LIBs up to now, among which a lot of research work focuses on finding alternative anode materials. Various transition metal oxides, for example,TiO2,4 Fe3O4,5 MnO2,6 Co3O4,7,8 MoO2,9 NiO,10 SnO211 and V2O5,12etc. have been regarded as competitive promising candidates for their high theoretical capacity, environmental friendliness and relatively low cost. However, they suffer from problems associated with the relatively poor electrical conductivity and the large volume change that occurs during the Li+ insertion and extraction which result in an insufficient lithium storage performance and a rapid capacity decay.13 Thus, fabrication of high-performance transition metal oxide electrode materials with large reversible capacities and good cycling stabilities remains a great challenge.
One strategy toward alleviating these problems is to design nanostructured electrode materials.14 Compared with their bulk counterparts, nanostructured electrode materials are particularly attractive for lithium storage due to their high surface-to-volume ratio and small size, which provide plenty of reaction sites and shorter diffusion paths. However, carbon based conductive agents and polymer binders are usually required to be mixed with the nanostructured electrodes, which introduces supplementary undesirable interfaces and defects as well as negates the benefits of reduced particle size, resulting in lower electron transfer velocities and electrolyte diffusion efficiency.15 The direct growth of nanostructured materials on various conductive substrates is an important issue to solve the problem as the good contact between the electrode materials and the substrates provides a pathway for charge transfer without any need for adding conductive agents and binders.16–19 Moreover, carbon coating, a facile and effective method, has been widely reported in lithium storage applications to improve the electrical conductivity of the electrode materials.20–22
Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) has received much attention in LIBs since Tarascon and coworkers' report in 200023 on the basis that it has a high theoretical capacity of 890 mA h g−1, which is twice as large as that of the most commonly used graphite (372 mA h g−1). Nanosized Co3O4 with different morphologies such as nanowires,13 nanotubes,24 nanobelts,7 nanosheets25 and nanocubes,26 have been fabricated through many methods, including sol–gel,27 reflux,28 electrodeposition29 and hydrothermal methods.30
In this work, we report the successful synthesis of highly symmetric Co3O4 hexapods assembled by numerous porous nanorods, which can be used as high performance anodes for LIBs. During the synthesis, uniform Co(OH)F hexapods were first grown on Cu foil through a facile hydrothermal method. By a thermal annealing procedure in N2 flow, porous nanorod-assembled Co3O4 hexapods were finally obtained. The as-prepared Co3O4 hexapods a with porous structure exhibited a very high reversible capacity and a good cycling stability and are expected to be attractive alternative anode materials for LIBs. Coated with carbon, the Co3O4 hexapods exhibit a further improved performance.
Experimental
Materials synthesis
All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Deionized (DI) water was used throughout. Prior to the synthesis, a copper foil was sonically cleaned by a mixture of ethanol and acetone with a volume ratio of 1:1 and then dilute hydrochloric acid for 5 min, respectively. The cleaned copper foil was cut into round pieces with a diameter of 8 mm for further usage. In a typical synthesis, 1 mmol of CoCl2·6H2O, 2 mmol of CO(NH2)2 and 5 mmol of NH4F were dissolved in 30 mL DI water under stirring at room temperature. After stirring for 15 min, the homogeneous solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and then four pieces of the clean copper foils were immersed in the reaction solution at the bottom of the autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 120 °C for 12 h inside an electric oven. After the autoclave was cooled naturally to room temperature, the copper foils coated with purple precursor only on the face-up side were picked out, rinsed with DI water and ethanol several times and dried at 60 °C under vacuum overnight. Finally, the as-obtained purple sample on the copper foil was annealed at 400 °C in N2 flow for 1 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
To get the carbon-coated Co3O4 sample, the as-grown Co3O4 samples on the copper foil were immersed into a 10 mL polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) aqueous solution (0.05 g mL−1) for 6 h. After this, the foil was taken out, dried at 80 °C in a vacuum, and further annealed in N2 flow at 500 °C for 2 h (heating rate 10 °C min−1) to allow the carbonization of PVP.
Materials characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a X-ray diffractometer (X'Pert PRO, PANalytical B.V., The Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The morphologies of the samples were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-3000F) coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and porosity were determined by nitrogen-sorption using a Micromeritics APSP 2020 analyzer. XPS measurements were performed on a VG Multilab 2000 system with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source.
Electrochemical measurement
The electrochemical behaviors of the as-formed Co3O4 samples were measured using coin type half-cells at room temperature. The coin cells (CR2032) were laboratory-assembled in an argon-filled glove box where moisture and oxygen concentrations were strictly limited to below 1 ppm. A lithium foil was used as the counter electrode and reference electrode. Celgard 2300 was used as the separator membrane. A piece of copper foil coated with Co3O4 sample was used directly as the working electrode without any conductive agent or polymeric binder involved. The electrolyte was 1 mol L−1 LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (v/v = 1:1). Cycling voltammetry (CV) was performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760D, CH Instruments Inc., Shanghai) at a scanning rate of 0.5 mV s−1. The galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were carried out on a Land Battery Measurement System (Land, China) at various current densities with a cut off voltage of 0.01–3.00 V vs. Li+/Li.
Results and discussion
The structure of the Co(OH)F precursor synthesized from the hydrothermal process was studied by XRD and the corresponding XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 1a. All peaks in this pattern can be indexed as Co(OH)F (JCPDS Card no. 50-0827) with lattice constants of a = 10.305 Å, b = 4.677 Å and c = 3.126 Å. When the precursor was annealed at 400 °C in N2 flow for 1 h, black sample was obtained and checked by XRD (Fig. 1b). All the identical peaks of the thermal treatment products can be perfectly indexed to a cubic spinel phase of Co3O4 (JCPDS Card no. 42-1467) except for the peaks originating from the Cu foil substrate. No other characteristic peaks for impurities were observed in these two XRD patterns, revealing the high purity of both the as-prepared precursor Co(OH)F and the annealed Co3O4 products. It also confirmed the complete conversion from the Co(OH)F precursor to the Co3O4 product, which matched well with the experimental phenomena that the purple precursor turns black after the thermal treatment.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are employed to investigate the morphologies and microstructures of the Co(OH)F precursor and the Co3O4 samples as shown in Fig. 2. From the low-magnification SEM image in Fig. 2a, it is obvious that the as-prepared Co(OH)F precursor with a uniform morphology was successfully grown on the Cu substrate on a large scale. The magnified SEM image shown in Fig. 2b indicates that the sample has a unique 3D hexapod-like shape with six blades laying in the same plane and a perfect angle of 60 degrees between adjacent blades. The length from the symcenter of the architecture to the edge of a blade is about 12 μm. Each blade consists of numerous nanorods with the same orientation forming a forked edge, which can be further confirmed from high-magnification SEM image inserted in Fig. 2b. A typical nanorod has a diameter of about 150 nm at the base while it becomes thinner at the tip. The corresponding SEM image of the annealed Co3O4 samples is shown in Fig. 2c, it revealed that the annealed samples still kept the hexapod-like shape of the Co(OH)F precursor. From the enlarged SEM image shown in Fig. 2d, we can see that the surface of the annealed sample becomes rough compared to the precursor with a smooth surface, which was obviously caused by thermal decomposition of the Co(OH)F precursor. A typical TEM image of the Co3O4 samples was shown in Fig. 2e, where the nanorods can be clearly seen. Besides, the image also indicated that the hexapods are of porous structure with a rough surface instead of the conventional single-crystalline nanorods. The highly porous texture was formed due to the dehydration and lattice contraction occurring during the thermal conversion from Co(OH)F to Co3O4, which agrees well with the SEM observations. Fig. 2f is a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image taken from a single nanoparticle within the individual porous Co3O4 nanorod. The clearly resolved lattice fringe spacings of 0.286 nm and 0.244 nm correspond well to the (220) and (311) crystal planes of the cubic spinel Co3O4 phase, respectively.

In our experiments, the use of NH4F plays a key role for the formation of the final Co3O4 hexapods. Once NH4F was used, Co(OH)F hexapods precursors were successfully synthesized, which determine the morphology of the resulted Co3O4 hexapods. In the absence of NH4F and keeping the other conditions constant, only bunch-like products were obtained, as shown in Fig. S1.† They are in loose contact with the Cu foil that can be easily rinsed away. The XRD pattern shows that the products are Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O (Fig. S2†).
With highly porous structures, the as-grown Co3O4 hexapods may have a large surface area. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and porosity were determined by nitrogen-sorption and the corresponding N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm is shown in Fig. 3. The isotherms are of type IV with a hysteresis loop at high relative pressure indicating the presence of mesopores. It agrees well with the morphology of porous Co3O4 hexapods. According to the result, the BET specific surface area and pore volume are calculated to be 134.84 m2 g−1 and 0.259 cm3 g−1, respectively.

The successful growth of porous Co3O4 hexapods with a uniform morphology on Cu foil with a high density makes it possible to use the samples directly as a binder-free anode for LIBs without any further treatment. The electrochemical properties of the Co3O4 hexapods were investigated by configuring them as coin-type batteries. Fig. 4a shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the Co3O4 electrode at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1 over the range of 0.01–3.00 V. In the first cycle, an irreversible reduction peak was observed at 0.55 V, which corresponds to the initial reduction of Co3O4 to metallic cobalt, the electrochemical formation of amorphous Li2O and a passivating solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film.31–33 During the subsequent anodic scan, there is a broad peak located at around 2.3 V, which can be attributed to the oxidation reaction and formation of CoO. These results can be described by the electrochemical conversion reactions as follows:34 Co3O4 + 8Li+ + 8e− → 3Co + 4Li2O(1) Co + Li2O → CoO + 2Li+ + 2e−(2)
 Fig. 4  (a) CV curves of the Co3O4 hexapods at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3.00 V vs. Li+/Li. (b) Discharge and charge curves of the Co3O4 electrodes cycled in the voltage range of 0.01–3.00 V vs. Li+/Li at a current density of 100 mA g−1. (c) Cycling performance of the Co3O4 electrodes at current densities of 100 and 500 mA g−1, respectively. (d) Coulombic efficiency of the Co3O4 electrodes cycling at 500 mA g−1. 
From the second cycle, the main reduction peak is shifted to 0.9 V and the peak intensity decreases apparently, while the main anodic peak at 2.3 V has very little modification. In addition, the peak intensity and integral area of the third cycle are very close to that of the second one, which exhibits good reproducibility and similar sharps, suggesting a high reversibility of lithium storage. The conversion reaction associated with these processes can be described as:34 Co + Li2O ↔ CoO + 2Li+ + 2e−(3)

Fig. 4b shows the discharge–charge curves for the Co3O4 electrodes at a current density of 100 mA g−1 over the range of 0.01–3.00 V vs. Li+/Li. It is observed that the initial discharge and charge capacities are 1540 and 1100 mA h g−1, respectively. There is an irreversible capacity loss of 28.6% for the first cycle, which can be mainly attributed to the irreversible reactions as shown in eqn (1) and (2). According to the equations, in the first discharge, 8 electrons per Co3O4 take part in the reaction, while in the first charge, only 6 electrons per 3Co reacted with Li2O, which leads to about a 25% irreversible capacity loss. Besides, the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer also attributed to the capacity loss according to previous reports.35,36 The long voltage plateau around 1.1 V is associated with a conversion from Co3O4 to an intermediate phase CoO, and then to Co during the lithium insertion process, in a good agreement with the typical characteristics of the voltage trend for Co3O4 electrodes.37,38 Since the second cycle, the discharge capacity reaches about 1100 mA h g−1 and there is no evident capacity loss. The voltage plateau appears a little higher at 1.3 V and stays stable during the redox processes.

Fig. 4c displays the discharge capacity versus cycle number for the Co3O4 electrode at different current densities. It was observed that the capacities of 800 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and 440 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 are retained after 40 cycles. After charging/discharging at a current density of 500 mA g−1 for 50 cycles, a specific capacity of 392 mA h g−1 is still obtained and the coulombic efficiency stays above 95%, indicating a high capacity and charge–discharge reversibility of the as-prepared Co3O4 hexapods.
It is believed that the unique structure and porosity should contribute to the high reversible capacity and cycling performance of the sample. First, the porous structure and small particle size of the Co3O4 hexapods may shorten the diffusion length of the lithium ions, introduce ample contact area to the electrolyte as well as more active sites for lithium storage.7 Second, the multilevel structure with 1D rod-like components, acting as the electron transport paths, facilitates the electrons delivery. Third, the open space in between and the porous structure allows for the easy diffusion of electrolyte into the inner region of the electrode.13,17,39 Moreover, the large volume change during the lithium insertion and extraction processes can also be accommodated by the open space and porous structure as to avoid the structure destruction of the active material, thereby enhancing the cycle stability.17,39–41
Carbon coating is a widely used strategy to improve the electrical conductivity of the electrode materials for LIBs. Here, it was also applied to further improve the performance of the as-prepared Co3O4 hexapods. The as-prepared Co3O4 samples on Cu foil were immersed into polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) aqueous solution, dried and annealed in N2 flow to allow the carbonization of PVP. Fig. 5a shows the XRD pattern of the corresponding Co3O4–C composites. Compared with the XRD pattern of pure Co3O4 hexapods (Fig. 1b), a weak broad peak at around 20–30° was observed, which is usually ascribed to amorphous carbon, according to previous reports, indicating the successful formation of amorphous carbon within the sample. From the SEM images shown in Fig. 5b and c, we can see that the Co3O4–C composites still keep the hexapod-like shape. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of the Co3O4–C composites is shown in Fig. 5d. The BET specific surface area and pore volume are 126.49 m2 g−1 and 0.248 cm3 g−1, respectively, also comparable to the Co3O4 hexapods. The above results confirm that after the carbonization process, both the crystallization and microstructure of the Co3O4 hexapods are well preserved without obvious destruction.

To further confirm the successful carbon coating and to determine the chemical composition of the Co3O4–C composites, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out in the region of 0–1100 eV (Fig. 6). The binding energies obtained in the XPS analysis were calibrated for specimen charging by referencing the C 1s peak to 284.6 eV. The sharp peaks in Fig. 6a at 284.6, 530.1 and 780.1 eV correspond to the characteristic peaks of C 1s, O 1s and Co 2p, respectively, indicating the existence of carbon, oxygen and cobalt elements in the sample. The XPS spectrum for Co 2p shown in Fig. 6b exhibits two major peaks at binding energies of 780.1 and 795.1 eV with a spin energy separation of 15 eV, corresponding to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of Co3O4 phase.42 The presence of Co3O4 can be further confirmed by the O 1s peak at 530.1 eV, which corresponds to the oxygen species in the Co3O4 phase (Fig. 6c).42 The small O 1s peak at 531.7 eV in the spectrum can be attributed to the oxygen species in hydroxyl. The high-resolution C 1s spectrum is shown in Fig. 6d. The strong C 1s peak at 284.6 eV is related to the amorphous carbon that was achieved during the carbonization process of PVP while the small peaks at 286.2 and 288.4 eV belong to the oxidative forms of hydrocarbons (such as C–OH and CO).43 From the results above, it is confirmed that after the carbonization treatment, pure Co3O4 sample has been successfully coated with amorphous carbon.

The electrochemical properties of the Co3O4–C composites were also investigated and the corresponding results were depicted in Fig. 7. From the discharge and charge curves shown in Fig. 7a, it is apparent that the carbon-coated Co3O4 electrodes show a high initial discharge capacity of about 1440 mA h g−1 in the first cycle and the irreversible capacity loss is also mainly caused by the irreversible electrochemical reaction and the formation of the SEI layer, similar to the pure Co3O4 sample. Since the second cycle, there is no evident capacity loss. The voltage plateau appears at 1.1 V, in a good agreement with the characteristics of the pure Co3O4 electrodes. Besides, it presents to be more apparent and flatter than the pure Co3O4 electrodes, which indicates a more stable cycling performance of the carbon-coated Co3O4 electrodes during the electrochemical reactions. Fig. 7b is the cycling performance of the carbon-coated Co3O4 electrodes at current densities of 100 mA g−1 and 500 mA g−1, respectively. From the curves, we can see that the carbon-coated Co3O4 electrodes exhibit much better electrochemical performance than that of the pure Co3O4 electrodes. The reversible capacity cycling at 500 mA g−1 after 50 cycles is as high as 664 mA h g−1, much better than 392 mA h g−1 for the pure Co3O4 electrodes. Table 1 shows the comparison of the reversible capacities of the sample before and after carbon coating, which provide more direct evidence that the carbon coated Co3O4 electrodes exhibited a further improved performance.

In our experiments, the amorphous carbon coating on the Co3O4 sample plays an important role in the enhanced battery performance because it increases the whole electrical conductivity of the electrodes which benefits the ionic and electronic diffusion. This feature allows electrons to reach the positions where Li+ ion intercalation takes place more easily and effectively. As a result, a better cycling performance was obtained for the carbon-coated Co3O4 electrodes.44,45
Conclusions
In summary, nanorod-assembled porous Co3O4 hexapods were successfully synthesized on Cu foil on a large scale through a facile hydrothermal method followed by a thermal annealing procedure. The as-prepared Co3O4 hexapods exhibited a very high reversible capacity and an excellent cycle stability. After the carbon-coating treatment, the electrochemical performance was further improved and a reversible capacity as high as 664 mA h g−1 was obtained even after 50 cycles at the higher current density of 500 mA h. The unique morphology, the porous hexapod-shaped Co3O4 products and the carbon coating are responsible for the outstanding electrochemical performances for LIBs. Basically, the synthetic method may be extended to the large-scale synthesis of other transition metal oxide nanostructures as high performance anodes for LIBs.
