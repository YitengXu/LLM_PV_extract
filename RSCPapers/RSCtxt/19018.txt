    , Accepted 23rd February 2021First published on 24th February 2021AbstractCu2O-based composites for photocatalysis have been extensively explored owing to their promising application in solving environmental and energy problems. At present, the research on photocatalysis is focused on improving the photocatalytic performance of materials. It has been reported that adjusting the morphology and size of Cu2O can effectively improve its photocatalytic property. However, photocorrosion is still an inevitable problem, which hinders the application of Cu2O in photocatalysis. The strategies of constructing heterogeneous nanostructures and ion doping can significantly improve the light stability, light absorption capacity and separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs. Cu2O-based composites exhibit superior performances in degrading organic matter, producing hydrogen, reducing CO2 and sterilization. Therefore, the construction of multi-materials will be one of the future directions in their photocatalytic application. This review summarizes the recent strategies for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of Cu2O by analyzing different Cu2O-based photocatalysts, and the charge transfer pathway is further discussed in detail. Finally, several opportunities and challenges in the field of photocatalysis are illustrated.
1 Introduction
With the increasing severity of the energy crisis and environment deterioration, the development of new energy sources is particularly urgent. Accordingly, photocatalysts have become a prime candidate since the dissociating water experiment was discovered by Fujishima and Honda in 1972.1 Afterwards, different types of photocatalysts have widely investigated, ranging from metal oxides (e.g. WO3,2,3 Cu2O,4–6 ZnO,7,8 and SnO29,10), non-oxides (CdS,11,12 CuInS2,13–15 and ZnS16–18), and metal-free semiconductors (e.g. C3N419–21), which can convert light energy into electrical energy. When the energy of photons is greater than the band gap energy, the electrons in the valence band (VB) can absorb the energy and be excited to the conduction band (CB). Meanwhile, holes are left in the VB.22–24 The photoinduced electrons and holes with enough activity will interact with water molecules and dissolved oxygen, generating free radicals (˙OH and ˙O2−),25 and ˙OH and ˙O2− participate in redox reactions. Therefore, the photocatalytic ability of a material is limited by many factors such as its light absorption capacity, band gap, electron transfer capacity, light energy strength and reaction system. Among them, the photosensitivity of the material significantly affects its photocatalytic performance. The quantum efficiency is a crucial index to measure the utilization ratio of materials to light, where the formula for the calculation of the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is as follows:  
The formula calculation for the of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is:  
To improve the IQE, the photogenerated carriers need to be transferred to the surface of the material before their recombination in the bulk phase.26 Therefore, reducing the size of the catalyst is a practical method, which can shorten the distance for photogenerated electrons to transfer to the surface. Additionally, enhancing the conductivity of materials is also an efficient strategy because it can reduce the charge transfer resistance between photocatalysts and solution. To improve the EQE, a narrow band gap is first required. A photocatalyst with a narrow band gap suggests that electrons are easily excited by light, indicating that the utilization ratio of incident light will be greatly improved. However, the excited carriers may not be sufficiently active to drive the redox reaction. In contrast, materials with a wide band gap have sufficient driving force but are difficult to excite. Therefore, the choice of catalyst with an appropriate band gap is very important.
As shown in Fig. 1(a), compared with the band structure of various photocatalysts, Cu2O allows for visible light absorption, and its negative conduction band position can drive most reduction reactions. Cu2O, which is a cheap and non-toxic p-type semiconductor, has received extensive attention in recent years.27 As shown in Fig. 1(b), the crystal structure of Cu2O is a body-centered cubic crystal, with an O atom in the center of the cube, 1/8 O atoms at the eight vertices, and 4 Cu atoms each connected to two O atoms, belonging to an isometric system, and the lattice constant is 0.427 nm.28 Cu2O possessing various shapes such as nanowires, nanocubes, nanospheres, dendrites, rhombic dodecahedra, and hollow truncated octahedra have been synthesized in the last decade (see Fig. 2).29–34 These unique morphologies can provide a variety of active planes and affect the specific surface area, which have a great influence on the photocatalytic performance.35 Zhang et al.36 reported Cu2O particles with the structure of cubes, octapods and concave cubes. In the photocatalytic hydrogen production test, the Cu2O-octapod particles exhibited higher activity than the Cu2O-cube and Cu2O-concave cube particles. However, the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and instability of the Cu2O crystals limited their photocatalytic activity. In this regard, it has been proven that combining Cu2O with other semiconductors can effectively improve its overall stability. Accordingly, Cu2O/semiconductor composites, such as Cu2O/WO3,37 Cu3Se2/Cu2Se/Cu2O,38 Cu2O/TiO2,39 Cu2O/C3N4,40 and Cu2O/ZnO,41 have exhibited broad application prospects as antibacterial agents,42 anti-viral agents,43 inactivating cancer cells,44 odor treatment,45 and water splitting.46 In addition to combining with semiconductors, the construction of hybrid metal/Cu2O photocatalysts is an alternative method. Metal nanoparticles have high electrical conductivity, which is beneficial for the transfer of electrons from the surface of the semiconductor to metal, improving the separation of electrons and holes. Also, the Schottky barriers at the metal–semiconductor interfaces can further restrain the recombination of electrons and holes during the photocatalytic process. The use of noble metals (Au47,48 and Ag49,50) as co-catalysts have been widely investigated, but metal Cu51,52 is the most prospective candidate due to its low price and abundant reserves. In comparison with binary composites, ternary materials can further expand the light absorption capacity, reduce the charge transfer resistance and improve the separation of electrons and holes,53 which are beneficial for photocatalytic reduction and oxidation. For example, Wang et al.54 constructed a Cu2O/Au/TiO2 composite film for the photocatalytic production of H2. The introduction of Au can inject electrons from TiO2 into the VB of Cu2O to form the Z mechanism, which maintains the high reducing sites of Cu2O. Therefore, Cu2O/Au/TiO2 exhibited higher hydrogen production activity than binary materials. Gopalakrishnan et al. reported that MoS2/rGO/Cu2O ternary films exhibited a higher photocurrent density, stronger light absorption and superior MB degradation activity than MoS2/rGO and MoS2.55 Therefore, ternary materials have higher application value in photocatalytic applications.

In this review, we summarize the crystal structures, application prospects, modification methods, and electron transfer mechanisms of different Cu2O-based photocatalysts reported in recent years. By analyzing the role of different components in the photocatalytic process, the reasons for the improved photocatalytic properties will be explained, and the currently recognized photocatalytic mechanisms are also compared and discussed. Finally, the common methods for proving the mechanism will also be presented and explained.
2 The application and research of Cu2O-based photocatalysts
2.1 Binary Cu2O/semiconductor heterostructures
Single Cu2O materials have the disadvantages of low photocatalytic efficiency and instability, and thus are far from meeting the actual application conditions. Interestingly, binary materials with a heterostructure usually show fascinating advantages of high stability, absorption capacity and efficiency separation of electron–hole pairs, resulting in exceptionally high photocatalytic efficiency, which exceeds the sum of two single photocatalysts. One of the main reasons for this is the formation of a heterojunction. For example, when Cu2O is in contact with an n-semiconductor, a space charge region can be constructed. Due to the interaction between the positive and negative charges in the space charge region, an internal electric field is formed. Under the action of the internal electric field, the transfer photo-generated electrons is easier between the two materials. Similarly, when Cu2O is in contact with a p-semiconductor, one side of the interface forms a hole carrier accumulation layer, and the other side forms a hole carrier depletion layer, structuring an internal electric field between the two photocatalysts. Thus, photocatalysts with a heterostructure have attracted significant attention in the field of photodegradation, photocatalytic hydrogen production, CO2 reduction and antimicrobial activity.

2.1.1 Photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI). 
Cr(VI) is a common heavy metal pollutant in wastewater, which mainly comes from the electroplating, tanning and dye industries. Compared with Cr(III), Cr(VI) has stronger fluidity, toxicity and carcinogenicity. Thus, the simple and efficient treatment of Cr(VI) is a current hot topic in academia and industry. The reduction of the highly toxic Cr(VI) to the low-toxic Cr(III) is the main method for water pollution treatment. Semiconductors have the potential to reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III) under the excitation of light in a specific wavelength range, which is an economic and safe method, and thus should be vigorously investigated and developed.
Xu et al.57 reported novel Cu2O/Bi5O7I composites for the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI). The degradation rate of pure Cu2O and Bi5O7I was less than 20%, whereas the degradation rate of 15% Cu2O/Bi5O7I (the mass percentage of Cu2O to Bi5O7I was 15%) was as high as 92.3%. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the BET result showed that the specific surface area of 15% Cu2O/Bi5O7I (6.45 m2 g−1) was about 3 times that of Bi5O7I (2.14 m2 g−1), which was due to the introduction of Cu2O. Moreover, Cu2O can act as reaction centers to enhance the reduction of Cr(VI) during the photocatalytic process. Fig. 3(b) shows the PL spectra of Bi5O7I and series of Cu2O/Bi5O7I composites. With the introduction of Cu2O, the fluorescence intensity of the composite material gradually weakened. When the content of Cu2O increased to 15%, the lowest fluorescence intensity was observed, indicating that the material had the lowest recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes. The EIS measurement displayed that the arc radius of the Nyquist circle of 15% Cu2O/Bi5O7I was smaller than that of Bi5O7I (seen Fig. 3(c)), indicating that its interface transfer resistance of photogenerated electrons was smaller than that of pristine Bi5O7I.

To further investigate the effect of the different crystal faces of Cu2O on the photoreduction of Cr(VI), Qin et al.58 synthesized Cu2O with rhombohedral, octahedral and cubic structures to compare the catalytic activity of the different exposed crystal faces. The photocatalytic activity for the reduction of Cr(VI) followed the order of rhombic dodecahedron > octahedron > cube, i.e., facets {110} > {111} > {100}. However, a difference in the surface area and grain size can also have a great effect on the photocatalytic efficiency. It was more reasonable to calculate the photocatalytic activity per unit surface area to compare the photocatalytic activity of Cu2O with different morphologies. The specific surface areas of the cubic, octahedral, and rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O by the BET method were 2.85, 0.65, and 0.96 m2 g−1, respectively. According to the formula k (rate constants)/SBET, the result of the specific activity followed the order of {111} > {110} > {100}. The reason for this is generally attributed to the degree of unsaturation of the crystal plane atoms.59 The {111} and {110} facets have more unsaturated sites than the {100} facet and the unsaturated sites can act as active sites to participate in the Cr(VI) reduction reaction. Therefore, the photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction ability of rhombic dodecahedron and octahedron Cu2O is stronger than that of cubic Cu2O.
In addition to considering the crystal face, the charge on the surface of Cu2O also plays a role in the reduction of Cr(VI). In the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI), K2Cr2O7 is often used as a model contaminant and Cu2O is usually the active site. Cr2O72− is an anion with a negative charge on its surface. Thus, considering the electrostatic interaction, the synthesis of positively charged Cu2O may be more conducive to react with Cr2O72−. Moreover, Cr3+ has poor solubility in neutral water and will generate solid Cr(OH)3. When the surface of Cu2O is positively charged, the generated Cr3+ will quickly leave the catalyst surface due to electrostatic repulsion, thereby preventing the generated Cr(OH)3 from being deposited on the surface of Cu2O.


2.1.2 Photodegradation. 
Water pollution, as one of the important environmental issues, has attracted wide attention. Organic pollutants are difficult to self-degrade in water, and their long-term existence and accumulation in water will seriously affect the natural environment and human health. Thus, to deal with difficult self-degradable organic matter, the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants is a cost-effective method. Under light conditions, the photocatalyst absorbs light energy and becomes excited, which in turn causes organic matter to be excited and decomposed. Long chain organic compounds can be decomposed into short chain small organic molecules. The ultimate goal is to decompose organic matter into CO2 and water molecules.
Tian et al.60 reported ZnWO4 nanorods modified with Cu2O nanoparticles for the degradation of methylene blue (MB). The obtained ZnWO4/Cu2O composites exhibited a strong photocurrent and efficient charge separation, promoting the degradation of MB. Su et al.61 systematically deduced the degradation process of MB via FTIR spectroscopy and ion chromatography. Firstly, Cu2O is excited by light to produce electrons and holes, and these electrons and holes further react with oxygen and water to form superoxide radicals (˙O2−) and hydroxyl radicals (˙OH). Then, the free radicals attack MB to generate single aromatic hydrocarbons compounds. The single aromatic hydrocarbons compounds are further oxidized to short-chain carboxylic acids such as fumaric acid, oxalic acid, and formic acid, and these short-chain carboxylic acids can be eventually degraded into CO2 and H2O.62
Electrons, holes, ˙O2− and ˙OH play an important role in the degradation of MB. Therefore, it is also very meaningful to determine the extent of their impact on degradation. In the degradation of ephedrine (EPH), Chen et al.63 employed EDTA-2Na, IPA, NaN3 and BQ as the scavengers of h+, ˙OH, 1O2 and ˙O2−, respectively. Fig. 4(a) shows that the introduction of EDTA-2Na and BQ significantly inhibited the degradation of EPH. The results indicate that h+ and ˙O2− had the greatest effect on the degradation of EPH. NaN3 had a moderate inhibition effect, demonstrating the relatively important role of 1O2. Interestingly, in the presence of IPA, the inhibition of EPH was low. Eliminating ˙OH in the solution had minimal impact on the degradation of EPH. Zhang et al.64 also discussed the effect of active substances in the degradation of tetracycline (see Fig. 4(b)). Similarly, EDTA-2Na, IPA, and BQ were employed as scavengers. The inhibition effect of EDTA-2Na on the degradation of CT was the highest, followed by BQ, and the inhibition effect of IPA was the smallest. This result suggests that the degradation ability of the active substance follows the order of h+ > ˙O2− > ˙OH. Wang et al.65 also performed an active matter scavenging experiment, and the addition of L-histidine, p-BQ, and EDTA-2Na exhibited an obvious inhibition effect on the degradation (see Fig. 4(c)). This means that the major active matters are h+, 1O2 and ˙O2− in the degradation process.

Although research on single-system degradation can evaluate the activity of photocatalysts to a certain extent, it does not correspond with the actual situation of water pollution. Accordingly, Zheng et al.66 reported porous double-shell Cu2O@CuCo2O4 hollow microspheres for the synergistic photocatalytic degradation of multi-pollutants. In the mixture system, chlorotetracycline (CTC) and nitrobenzene (NB) were used as model pollutants. Interestingly, the Cu2O@CuCo2O4 photocatalyst exhibited a superior photocatalytic performance than the single pollutant system (see Fig. 5), which is attributed to the synergistic effects of oxidation/reduction. In the photocatalytic process, the accumulation of electrons and holes is not conducive to the progress of the reaction. Thus, while NB consumes electrons, CTC, as a hole acceptor, can consume holes quickly, significantly improving the efficiency of photodegradation.

In addition to the research on complex systems, the degradation pathway of pollutants should also be discussed in detail. Employing HPLC-MS, the intermediates in the degradation of organic matter were systematically deduced by Zheng et al.,66 Tang et al.,67 and Ali et al.68 By analyzing the HPLC-MS data, the intermediate products with a small m/z values were detected. It is believed that organic matter can be completely mineralized into CO2 and H2O by increasing the photocatalytic reaction time. At present, the main active substances recognized in the degradation process are free radicals.69–71 The generation processes of free radicals are shown by the following equations: M + hν → M (h+ + e−)(1) h+ + H2O → H+ + ˙OH(2) 2h+ + 2H2O → 2H+ + H2O2(3) H2O2 → 2˙OH(4) e− + O2 → ˙O2−(5) ˙O2− + 2˙OH + H+ → H2O2 + O2(6) H2O2 → 2˙OH(7)where M, h, ν, h+, and e− are the photocatalyst, Planck's constant, light frequency, hole, and electron, respectively.


2.1.3 Water splitting. 
Due to the adverse effects of greenhouse gases on the environment, the development of hydrogen to replace fossil fuels has become urgent.72 TiO2 with strong oxidizing activity, corrosion resistance and nontoxicity has been widely investigated in the field of photocatalysis. However, TiO2 with a band gap of 3.2 eV cannot be effectively activated by visible light. Therefore, introducing Cu2O is necessary for enhancing the absorption of visible light. Hybrid Cu2O/TiO2 photocatalysts have been investigated extensively in the photocatalytic production of hydrogen.73–76 Because the surface atomic structure is different on different exposed surfaces, the construction of Cu2O/TiO2 composites with specific facets is greatly valuable to investigate their photocatalytic ability.77–79
Wei et al.80 reported Cu2O/TiO2 composites with different exposed facets, and also discussed the effect of oxygen vacancies on their hydrogen production performance. A schematic illustration of the synthetic routes is shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). The synthesis of (001)-faceted TiO2 (T0) was a facile hydrothermal method using titanium butoxide as the titanium source, while the source of (101)-faceted TiO2 (T1) was P25 TiO2 nanoparticles.81 The as-synthesized TiO2 was heated in a hydrogen atmosphere to fabricate oxygen-deficient faceted TiO2, and then Cu2O nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of TiO2 with different exposed faces via a photodeposition route. The photodeposition method could effectively protect the crystal face of the material from being damaged during the combining progress. Also, by the photodeposition method, about 2 nm Cu2O quantum dots were successfully synthesized. By comparing the hydrogen production data, the Cu2O/TiO2 composites with (101) exposed planes and oxygen vacancies exhibited the best photocatalytic activity among the pre-prepared photocatalysts. The main reason for the increased efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production was attributed to the formation of defects and different plane contacts. Compared with Cu2O/T0, the PL intensity after the hydrogen reduction of Cu2O/T1 was significantly weakened. Time-resolved PL spectroscopy was performed to obtain the excitation kinetics of the charge carriers. Interestingly, τ1 decreased and τ2 increased after depositing Cu2O on T0, while τ1 increased and τ2 decreased after depositing Cu2O on T1, indicating the formation of a type II junction and Z-scheme charge transfer in the Cu2O/T0-VO system and Cu2O/T1-VO system, respectively. Different crystal plane contacts resulted in a change in the electron transfer mode. The Z-scheme charge transfer can promote the separation of charge carriers more efficiently than type II, thereby improving the efficiency of hydrogen production.

Besides adjusting the exposed facet of TiO2, it is also an effective method to adjust the crystal face of Cu2O for improving its photocatalytic ability. The exposed facets of Cu2O are usually the low-index (111), (100) and (110) facets. Generally, the photocatalytic activity is considered to follow the sequence of (110) > (111) > (100), which is attributed to the number and density per unit surface area of Cu dangling bonds on the different facets.82 However, Zheng et al.83 found that the Cu2O (111) facets are more stable than the Cu2O (100) and (110) facets during the photocatalytic reaction. With an increase in irradiation time, the Cu2O microcrystals gradually disappear and transform into nanosheets with (111) planes. The resulting nanosheets exhibit stable photocatalytic activity. Michael H. Huang et al.35 reported a facile method for the synthesis of Cu2O nanocrystals with different exposed facets. Given that the solution pH has a great influence on the growth rate of Cu2O crystals, Cu2O nanocrystals with different facets can be fabricated by adjusting the amount of NH2OH·HCl. Fig. 7 displays cubic Cu2O oriented to show the (100) and (111) planes. The crystal model indicates that the (100) plane contains oxygen atoms and the cutting of the unit cell on one of its (111) planes reveals the presence of surface Cu atoms with dangling bonds. Compared with the (100) plane, the (111) plane has a higher surface energy, which is expected to have higher catalytic activity. Furthermore, Cu2O crystals containing positively charged copper atoms on their surface may interact more strongly with negatively charged molecules, indicating the existence of photocatalytic selectivity on different surfaces of Cu2O. Also, the energy levels of Cu2O on the different crystal surfaces are different. Zhang et al.84 found that photo-electrons tend to accumulate at the high index facets, whereas holes are easily transferred to the (100) plane. In the process of water splitting, Cu2O with both high index facets and (100) facets exhibited superior H2 evolution. This indicates that the energy levels of the two facets are different. The slight energy difference between two different crystal planes can drive electron transfer from one facet to another, successfully resulting in charge separation.

Overall water splitting is a chance and challenge in photocatalytic development. Overall water splitting is a reaction with increasing Gibbs free energy, and thus needs a sustainable supply of energy.85 Different from half-reactions (H2 evolution reaction and O2 evolution reaction), photocatalytic overall water splitting can produce H2 and O2 simultaneously without sacrificial agents and an external bias voltage. The reaction needs material to have a strong visible-light-response capability. Therefore, it is key to fabricate appropriate heterogeneous materials for the development of water splitting. Lou et al.86 fabricated a crystalline Cu2O/amorphous Ta2O5 heterogeneous material with a high AQE under visible light in overall water splitting. The AQE at wavelengths of 400, 420, 450, 480 nm was calculated to be 4%, 3.5%, 3.3%, and 3%, which indicates that Cu2O/amorphous Ta2O5 has strong light response ability. To improve the photocatalytic efficiency, the introduction of a cocatalyst such as noble metals (Pt, Au, and Rh) and metal oxide nanoparticles (MnOx, RuOx, IrO2, and CoOx) is an effective means for the enhancement of the splitting water rate.87–90 Overall water splitting involves two half-reactions as follows:
H+ reduction reaction: 2H+ + 2e− = H2(8)
H2O oxidation reaction: 2H2O + 4h+ = O2 + 4H+(9)
The oxidation–reduction reaction occurs simultaneously, and the overall reaction rate is limited by the transmission rate of electrons and holes. Noble metals (Pt, Au, and Rh) as electron acceptors can rapidly transfer electrons from the surface of the photocatalyst, which can accelerate the separation rate of electrons and holes. Metal oxide nanoparticles (MnOx, RuOx, IrO2, and CoOx) are considered to reduce the overpotentials required to oxidize water to produce molecular oxygen.91 The introduction of two co-catalyst species can greatly enhance the transmission rate of electrons and holes simultaneously, and the splitting water rate will also be significantly enhanced.


2.1.4 CO2 reduction. 
The emission and accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is one of the main factors causing the greenhouse effect. Accordingly, photocatalytic CO2 conversion into chemical fuels is a potential method to solve climate problems.93–95 The construction of porous carriers with inherent photocatalytic activity and excellent gas transport performance has irreplaceable advantages and application prospects in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Sun et al.92 reported g-C3N4 foam/Cu2O quantum dots (QDs) with excellent CO2 adsorption for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Fig. 8(a) shows a schematic illustration of the formation of the g-C3N4 foam and g-C3N4 foam/Cu2O QDs. The g-C3N4 foam was synthesized via a directional freezing method, and then Cu2O QDs were loaded via photoreduction. Fig. 8(b) shows that the framework of the obtained CFC-0.2 (g-C3N4 foam/Cu2O) foam is composed of well-arranged spherical pores, which is a key to absorbing CO2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an effective tool to evaluate the ability of interfacial charge transfer. The smaller the charge transfer resistance (Rct), the easier it is for electrons to reduce CO2. As shown in Fig. 8(c), CFC-0.2 has the smallest diameter among all prepared photocatalysts, which indicates that the charge transfer ability of CFC-0.2 is the strongest. The ability to capture CO2 is the most important part among the many factors that affect the CO2 reduction reaction. It can be seen from Fig. 8(d) that CFC-0.2 exhibits stronger CO2 adsorption capacity than bulk g-C3N4 powder and g-C3N4 foam at 0 °C, which indicates the presence of a strong binding force between CO2 and the photocatalyst. The strong binding force can ensure that CO2 has sufficient time to be reduced by photogenerated electrons at the CFC-0.2 surface. In addition, the reduction product of CO2 needs also to leave the active site easily to ensure that the active site is not occupied.96–98 In the g-C3N4 foam/Cu2O QD photocatalytic system, the hierarchical porous structure could improve the adsorption performance and mass transfer performance, and the Cu2O ODs, probably as an electron acceptor, promoted charge separation and provided active sites for the reduction of CO2. This synergistic effect between g-C3N4 foam and Cu2O QDs is an important reason for the improvement in catalytic performance.

It is well known that for CO2 to be reduced, the electrode potential of the photocatalyst conduction band (CB) needs to be more negative than the standard electrode potential of the product (Table 1).100 Therefore, it can be seen from Table 1 that the reduction product of CO2 is not necessarily a pure product when the position of the CB is much more negative by twice or more the standard reduction potential of CO2. Specifically, it is difficult to selectively reduce a single product. In a gas atmosphere, H2, CO and CH4 may exist simultaneously, and HCOH, CH3COH and C2H5OH may be in the solution. Shi et al.37 reported Cu2O/WO3-001 (Cu2O decorated WO3 nanosheets with dominant (001) facets) composites for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Cu2O/WO3-001 synthesized via the electrodeposition method could convert CO2 to CO and O2, while Cu2O/WO3-001 fabricated though mechanical mixing could reduce CO2 to CO, O2 and H2. However, the existence of multiple gas products indicates that the use of gas energy requires subsequent separation and purification, which is not conducive to industrialization.

Jiang et al.99 reported Cu2O with {111} facet composites modified with W18O49, and the conversion rate of CO2 to CH4 achieved was as high as 94.7%. The CO* intermediate is considered vital to determine the CO2 photocatalytic conversion products, and thus in situ infrared spectroscopy measurement was carried out to monitor the reaction of CO* intermediates. As shown in Fig. 9(a) and (b), the infrared peaks at 2113.4 and 2171.8 cm−1 can be attributed to the CO* intermediates. Compared with the Cu2O{111} facets, the peak intensity of the CO* intermediates decreases more slowly on the W18O49/Cu2O{111} interfaces, which suggests that the desorption of CO is difficult on the W18O49/Cu2O{111} interfaces. DFT calculation was performed to further analyze the adsorption energy of CO on the W18O49/Cu2O{111} interfaces. According to the calculated results, CO* has two binding configurations on the Cu2O{111} facets. When the C atom of the CO* intermediate is adsorbed on the Cu2O{111} facets, the adsorption energy is −2.27 eV. When the O atom of the CO* intermediate is adsorbed on the Cu2O{111} facets, the adsorption energy is −0.73 eV (see Fig. 9(c)). Similarly, when the C and O atoms of the CO* intermediate are attached to the W18O49/Cu2O{111} interfaces, the adsorption energy is −2.92 and −1.31 eV, respectively. The adsorption energies of CO* on the W18O49/Cu2O{111} interfaces are lower than that on the Cu2O{111} facets, which indicates that the desorption of CO* on the W18O49/Cu2O{111} interfaces is more difficult than that on Cu2O{111}. The long-term adsorption of CO on the surface of W18O49/Cu2O{111} is beneficial for the formation of CH4 but not to the generation of CO.

Interestingly, Jeong et al.101 successfully charge the CH4 and CO production rate by varying the surface ligand molecules. When Cu2O/TiO2 with no ligand treatment reduced CO2, the main product was 24 μmol g−1 h−1 of CO. After introducing excess taurine, the rate of CH4 generation increased from 3.73 to 7.86 μmol g−1 h−1 and the formation rate of CO dropped sharply from 7.21 to 2.97 μmol g−1 h−1. In contract, when ethylenediamine was adsorbed on the Cu2O/TiO2 surface, the CO selectivity was enhanced significantly and the CH4 selectivity further decreased. To determine the reasons for the selective CO2 reduction, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements were performed to monitor the intermediates during the CO2 reduction process. In the photocatalytic system with taurine, the peaks of various intermediates appeared on the infrared spectrum with the extension of the observation time, such as CO2−, bidentate carbonate and polydentate carbonate. This indicated that there was a strong binding force between the photocatalyst surface and the intermediate, which is conducive for the further multi-electron reaction of the intermediate, resulting in the eight-electron production of CH4. In the presence of ethylenediamine, only CO2− bands were observed in the initial and final stage, which suggested a weak binding force between the photocatalyst surface and the intermediate, producing CO gas easily.
Due to the different CO2 reduction capabilities on the different crystal faces of Cu2O, it is necessary to systematically investigate the activity of these crystal faces. Wu et al.102 investigated the facet-dependent activity of single Cu2O for the reduction of CO2 to methanol. X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy was performed to detect changes in the valence state of Cu. The white-line peak at 8981.0 eV shifted 1.0 to 1.5 eV in the higher energy direction, which indicated that the valence state of Cu changed from +1 to +2 due to the co-adsorption of H2O/CO2. A green laser was used as an excitation source under CO2/H2O airflow, and the peak shifted by 1 eV, suggesting that the major valence of Cu shifted back to +1. These changes indicated the CO2 and H2O adsorbed on the Cu2O (110) facet caused a change in the electron density of the Cu active sites. Under green light illumination, the chemical bond between Cu and CO2 was broken, and CO2 was reduced by accepting photogenerated electrons, while H2O was oxidized by accepting photogenerated holes. However, the valence state of the Cu atom on the (100) facet did not change under the same test conditions, indicating the (100) facet was photocatalytically inert.


2.1.5 Antimicrobial activity. 
Antibacterial agents have the effect of inhibiting the reproduction of microorganisms within a certain period. The common antibacterial agents can be divided into organic antibacterial agents and inorganic antibacterial agents. Compared with organic antibacterial agents, inorganic antibacterial agents have the advantages of anti-aging, heat resistance and cold resistance. Wang et al.103 reported a photocatalyst of Cu2O anchored MXene (Ti3C2Tx) nanosheets, which was applied as an antibacterial agent against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The fluorescence labeling method was performed to distinguish the live or dead colonies, in which the red and green dots represent the dead and living bacteria, respectively. The antibacterial results of the MXene, Cu2O, mixture, and Cu2O/MXene against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa are shown in Fig. 10. By comparing the number of colonies in the different Petri dishes, the colonies in the (a5), (b5), (c5) and (d5) Petri dishes have the smallest number, which indicates that Cu2O/MXene has the strongest antibacterial activity among the prepared sterilizers. Cu+, Cu2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in extinguishing bacteria, in which Cu+ and Cu2+ can damage DNA bacteria, while ROS are specifically aimed at damaging the cell membranes.104 Both of these pathways are effective in killing bacteria. However, the lack of selectivity of photocatalysts has always been a problem to be solved, and thus improving the selectivity of photocatalysts should be considered in further work.

In summary, Table 2 exhibits the Cu2O/semiconductor composites with different morphologies and applications. Among the many semiconductor materials, metal oxides are the most frequently used. The morphology metal oxides is easy to adjust and the contact of different crystal planes of composite materials can be better designed. In addition, sheet materials with a graphene structure have attracted much attention due to their large specific surface area. Thus, the rational construction of binary materials will have great application prospects.

2.2 Binary Cu2O/metal heterostructure
The charge separation efficiency and charge transfer resistance are generally recognized as the key factors affecting the photocatalytic activity of materials. However, electrons excited by light will spontaneously transform from the excited state to the ground state, which indicates that the retention and accumulation of photoelectrons on the surface of Cu2O is not conductive to photocatalytic reactions. Thus, the introduction of a metallic element is a practical method to solve these problems. Elemental metal as a collection of electrons can accept electrons from the surface of the catalyst and act as an active site to accelerate the consumption of electrons. Moreover, when the frequency of the incident photon matches the overall vibration frequency of the precious metal nanoparticles on the surface of Cu2O, the nanoparticles will have a strong absorption effect on the photon energy. At this time, a strong resonance absorption peak appears in the spectrum, which indicates that the metal/Cu2O structure photocatalyst can absorb light at long wavelengths. Therefore, it has been proposed to combine metal elements with Cu2O for further improving their light absorption capability and electron transfer ability. In addition, the Schottky barrier formed at the metal/Cu2O interface can effectively prevent the recombination of electrons and holes in the photocatalysis process, which can significantly increase the residence time of electrons on the surface of materials. This ensures that electrons and holes have sufficient time to undergo redox reactions with water. Therefore, metal/Cu2O photocatalysts have been widely investigated, such as Au/Cu2O,47,118,119,125–127 Ag/Cu2O,120,122,128–131 and Cu/Cu2O.52,124,132–137
As a typical representative with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), Au/Cu2O nanostructures have been intensively investigated in recent years. As shown in Fig. 11(a), Kuo and coworkers47 reported the synthesis of Au@Cu2O core@shell nanocrystals with controllable shell thicknesses via the chemical reduction method, which exhibited activity for the degradation of MO. In the Au@Cu2O nanocrystals, the Au core as an electron acceptor can promote the charge separation of Cu2O, which is an important reason for improving its photocatalytic performance. Wang and coworkers118 reported a novel Au/Cu2O multi-shelled porous heterostructure via a facile chemical route at room temperature (see Fig. 11(b)). The hollow structure can provide a high specific surface area and efficient paths for ion diffusion, and the Au nanoparticles deposited on the surface of Cu2O can also effectively adjust their band structure. These features indicate that it has potential application value in the fields of photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis. Yu et al. reported a core–shell structured Au nanorod@octahedron Cu2O with preferentially edge-loaded Au nanoparticles (Au(R)@Cu2O–Au(P)) via a heterogeneous growth method (see Fig. 11(c)).119 It was found that a short charge transfer distance and high charge transfer efficiency can effectively improve the photocatalytic degradation of MO. Comparing the three reports above, we can find that Au particles can be inside Cu2O or adsorb on the surface of Cu2O, which can significantly improve the photocatalytic activity of Cu2O. In general, the catalytic reaction occurs on the surface of the material. Gold particles as the core do not directly participate in the reaction. The gold particles on the surface not only can promote charge separation but also serve as active sites to participate in the catalytic reaction. However, what structures are more advantageous needs to be studied systematically. In summary, Cu2O modified by Au nanoparticles exhibits excellent photocatalytic performances, which is attributed to its tunable band structure, high charge transfer efficiency and localized surface plasma effect.

Similar to Au, Ag as a precious metal also has LSPR and can significantly improve the charge transfer efficiency. Ag is relatively cheap and abundant compared with Au, and the research on Ag/Cu2O photocatalysts has been reported extensively. As shown in Fig. 11(d), Yang and coworkers prepared Ag/Cu2O spherical microstructures by thermally decomposing Ag-acetate to deposit Ag nanoparticles on the surface of Cu2O.120 Since Ag can transfer electrons and holes in Cu2O to the surface through the Schottky barrier to prevent light corrosion, Ag/Cu2O heterostructures have excellent stability when exposed to oxygen, water and light. Qin et al.121 reported the synthesis of Ag/Cu2O nanocubes via a one-step wet chemistry approach (see Fig. 11(e)). The introduction of Ag nanoparticles reduced the band gap and increased the photocurrent, resulting in enhancement in the photocatalytic activity under visible light illumination. As shown in Fig. 11(f), Zhang and coworkers reported the synthesis of interlaced nanoflake-assembled flower-like hierarchical Ag/Cu2O composite microspheres via an environmentally friendly solvothermal method.122 This photocatalyst showed an excellent MO degradation performance, which was 121 times that of commercial Cu2O powder. When Ag particles are loaded on the surface of Cu2O, the crystal face factor should be considered. Therefore, the selective deposition of Ag nanoparticles on the specific surface of Cu2O should be investigated in the future.
In addition to noble metal elements (such as Au, Pt and Ag), LSPR can also be formed between Cu and Cu2O.138 Therefore, the Cu element with the advantages of low price and abundant reserves is expected to replace precious metals in the field of photocatalysis. Moreover, the synthesis of Cu/Cu2O photocatalysts is convenient because Cu2+ can be used directly as a source of Cu and Cu2O, and the core–shell structure is easy to construct. The Cu2O shell can be fabricated via the oxidation of Cu substances, and the Cu shell can be formed via the reduction of Cu2O. For example, Li and coworkers123 reported a star-shaped Cu/Cu2O nanostructure via a facile hydrothermal method, which was applied in the C–N Ullmann coupling reaction without the use of ligands and solvents (see Fig. 11(g)). As shown in Fig. 11(h), Li et al.52 controllably synthesized Cu2O–Cu nanocomposites with a core–shell structure using a low-power CO2 laser reduction approach. During the synthesis of Cu2O–Cu, the Cu2O suspension was synthesized first, and then irradiated with CO2 light of different energy to generate Cu2O–Cu. It should be noted that the position of the Cu2O VB does not convert water into ˙OH, and thus the addition of H2O2 is necessary to form ˙OH and ˙OOH. Interestingly, the degradation efficiency of MB and RhB with a positive charge reached 90.10% and 80.30%, respectively, while the degradation efficiency of MO with a negative charge was 48.65% after irradiation for 50 min, suggesting that these Cu2O–Cu spheres exhibit activity for the selective degradation of positively charged dyes. Zhan et al.124 prepared a superwetting Cu@Cu2O film via a one-step electrodeposition method (see Fig. 11(i)). The reactions on the electrodes are as follows: Anode: 2H2O − 4e− → 4H+ + O2(10) Cathode: Cu2+ + e− → Cu+(11) 2H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−(12) 2Cu2+ + 2e− + 2OH− → Cu2O + H2O(13) Cu+ + e− → Cu0(14)
More importantly, the as-prepared film exhibited superhydrophilic/underwater superoleophobic characteristics and excellent cycle stability for the degradation of MB.
Thus far, the introduction of metals has been proven to improve the photocatalytic performance of Cu2O. The synthesis and application of hybrid metal/Cu2O nanostructures are summarized in Table 3. By compounding Cu2O with an appropriate amount of metal nanoparticles, the absorption wavelength range and the speed of charge transfer of Cu2O can be obviously improved. However, the ability of single-metal nanoparticles to improve the photocatalytic performance of Cu2O is still unsatisfactory. Thus, to further improve the photocatalytic activity, the influence of the Cu2O crystal facets should also be considered because the work functions, conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum of Cu2O with different exposed facets are different. It is also important to selectively deposit metal particles on appropriate surfaces.

2.2.1 Ternary Cu2O-based heterostructure. 
During the past few decades, binary Cu2O-based composites have been widely investigated in water decomposition, pollutant degradation, carbon dioxide reduction and other fields. However, the photocatalytic ability shown by binary photocatalytic materials is far from meeting the needs of society. Thus, to further improve the photocatalytic activity of catalysts, research on ternary materials is crucial. Usually, ternary Cu2O-based photocatalysts consist of three parts, namely a conductor, Cu2O and n-semiconductor. The reason for this is that the contact between Cu2O as a p-semiconductor and n-semiconductor can easily form a heterojunction, which can effectively restrain the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Also, the conductor can accept electrons from the semiconductor and further promote the separation of electrons and holes. In contrast to the traditional p–n heterojunction, the transfer capacity of interfacial charge can be enhanced owing to the introduction of a conductor. A large number of ternary Cu2O-based materials have been developed, such as Cu-Cu2O/C3N4,139 Cu2O/graphene/α-Fe2O3,140 and Cu/Cu2O/rGO.141
For example, Zhang et al.142 reported the synthesis of a ternary Ag-Cu2O/ZnO nanorod photocatalyst via solvothermal method combined with a chemical reduction process. In the electrochemical tests (see Fig. 12(a) and (b)), the 0.6Ag-0.4Cu2O/ZnO NRs exhibited the highest photocurrent density and the lowest charge transfer resistance, which are attributed to the synergistic effect of Cu2O and Ag. Ag, as a metal conductor, can reduce the charge transfer resistance and further capture the excess electrons accumulated on the surface of Cu2O to promote the separation of electrons and holes. The fluorescence spectra are shown in Fig. 12(c). The fluorescence intensity of materials can reflect the recombination efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The fluorescence intensity of 0.6Ag-0.4Cu2O/ZnO is the lowest, which suggests the photogenerated electrons and holes of 0.6Ag-0.4Cu2O/ZnO show the lowest recombination efficiency. To evaluate the photocatalytic performance of various samples, a photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiment was performed. It can be seen in Fig. 12(d) that pure ZnO and Cu2O exhibited the lowest CO2 conversion rate. The CO yield of the 1Cu2O/ZnO composite was 8.14 μmol g−1, which is about 7 times higher than that of pure ZnO or Cu2O. The activity of the 0.6Ag-0.4Cu2O/ZnO photocatalyst was even higher than that of the optimal Cu2O/ZnO composite, demonstrating that the introduction of Ag element can exert a significant rectification effect on the electrons in the photocatalytic production of CO. By loading Ag nanoparticles, the charge separation of the material is more effective, and the Z-type charge transfer path formed between ZnO and Cu2O further improves the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst.

Adopted with permission from ref. 154. Elsevier (2020). 
Similarly, Fu et al.143 fabricated a TiO2-Ag-Cu2O composite for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen generation. The synergetic effect of Cu2O and Ag was the key to the enhanced visible-light absorption ability. Moreover, the strong SPR of the Ag nanoparticles resulted in a dual Z-scheme charge transfer pathway in the composite, which ensured that the active sites with high redox ability played a role in the photocatalytic process. Luo et al.144 reported Au@TiO2/Cu2O composites for hydrogen production from ethanol. Interestingly, by adjusting the conditions of the Au deposition sequence, Luo et al. found that Au deposited on TiO2 and then compounded with Cu2O exhibited better photocatalytic activity. Au adjacent to the surface Ti3+ defects acted as active sites and the p–n junction of Cu2O/TiO2 promoted the separation of electrons and holes. Therefore, the photocatalytic performance of Au@Cu2O/TiO2 (Au deposited on Cu2O and then compounded with TiO2) was lower than that of Au@TiO2/Cu2O due to the alloying of Au-Cu. The weak H2 production rate of Au@Cu2O/TiO2@Au (Cu2O compounded with TiO2 and then Au deposited on Cu2O/TiO2) was due to the lower quantity of Au-OV-Ti3+. The deposition position of the metal has a significant impact on the photocatalytic reaction. Therefore, during the construction of ternary materials, the metal deposition sites need to be discussed in detail and the reasons affecting the catalysis should also be explained. Compared with binary Cu2O-based materials, ternary composite materials are more advantageous for further application. The addition of a small amount of metal can cause the activity of the photocatalytic system to be greatly improved. Besides accelerating the charge transfer from composite materials, the construction of a Schottky junction can further prevent the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Also, noble metal themselves can act as catalysts to some extent. Thus, the key is to combine the advantages of various materials to form multi-materials for further improving their photocatalytic performances (Table 4).

2.2.2 Ion-doped Cu2O. 
In addition to constructing heterostructures, ion doping is also an effective method to improve the photocatalytic activity of Cu2O. By doping anions (F, Cl and N) instead of O, the carrier concentrations and light absorption capacity of materials can be enhanced obviously. Yu et al.155 reported an F-doped Cu2O material and calculated the carrier concentration of the semiconductor using the Mott–Schottky equation. 1/C2 = (2/eε0εNd)[(V − VFB) − kT/e](15)where C, e, ε0, ε, V, k, T, and Nd represent the capacitance of the space charge region, electron charge, vacuum permittivity, dielectric constant of the material (for Cu2O, ε = 6.3(20)), electrode applied potential, Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature, and donor concentration, respectively. The result of this calculation showed that the electron concentration of the F-doped Cu2O is more than ten-fold that of the pure Cu2O sample. Yu et al.156 reported Cl-doped Cu2O nanorods with visible-light driven CO2 reduction ability. The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrum indicated the Cl-doped Cu2O successfully enhanced the light absorption capacity of pure Cu2O. Similarly, cation doping can also significantly improve the photocatalytic ability of Cu2O. For alkaline metals, their doping is mainly to reduce their direct energy band, and an increase in carrier density and electrical conductivity can also be obtained. In addition, transition metal ion (such as Co, Mn and Zn)-doped Cu2O has also been widely reported. Lv and co-workers157 explained the photocatalytic properties of Mn-doped Cu2O through DFT calculations. The results indicated that the doping of Mn element changes Cu2O from a semiconductor phase to a metal phase, and the visible range absorption intensity and photocatalytic efficiency are also enhanced. Zhang et al.158 reported Zn-doped Cu2O microcubes, and the H2 production rate of Cu2O with 0.1 wt% Zn was about 6 times as higher than that of pure Cu2O.
Atomically dispersed catalysts have become an emerging research hotspot in recent years. Due to their unique coordination environment, high atom utilization and high dispersion, atomically dispersed catalysts exhibit excellent photocatalytic performances. Liu et al.159 reported Cu2O-supported atomically dispersed Pd catalysts for the semi-hydrogenation of terminal alkynes. As shown in Fig. 13(a), Pd2+ can replace Cu+via a galvanic displacement reaction, and then the valence state of Pd2+ can be converted to +1. As shown in Fig. 13(b), the circled bright spot indicates the Pd+ that replaces Cu+. The FT-EXAFS spectra indicate that the Pd in Pd1/Cu2O exists in the form of Pd–O instead of Pd–Pd, and the valence state of Cu in Pd1/Cu2O is +1 (see Fig. 13(c) and (d)). It can be seen in Fig. 13(e) that the conversion rate was 100%, and the selectivity from phenylacetylene to styrene was 95.4%.

3. Photocatalytic mechanisms
Photocatalytic nanomaterials are mostly semiconductor materials such as metal oxides or sulfides. Therefore, the electronic energy inside the photocatalyst is discontinuous. When the energy absorbed by the photocatalyst is greater than its band gap, the electrons from the valence band (VB) will be excited to the CB and holes are left in the VB. The electrons in the CB will participate in the reduction reaction and holes in the VB take part in the oxidation reaction.
To date, there are two recognized mechanisms for electron transfer in photocatalytic systems of composite materials, including the type-II and Z-scheme mechanisms. As shown in Fig. 14(a), the electrons from the more negative CB will transfer to the more positive CB; meanwhile, the holes on the VB will transfer to the more positive VB. The main driving force of charge transfer is usually attributed to the internal electric field at the contact interface of the p-semiconductor and n-semiconductor. However, this electron transfer method will weaken the redox ability of the photocatalytic system, and it is not suitable for reactions requiring strong redox capacity. Using photosynthesis in nature as a reference,160 the Z-scheme mechanism was proposed to explain the mechanism of requiring strong redox capacity. As shown in Fig. 14(b), the electrons and holes with similar potential positions are combined, while the electrons and holes with high redox ability are retained. In the ternary photocatalytic system, the judgment of the electron transfer mode is mainly related to the position of the conductor. As shown in Fig. 14(c) and (d), the site of G (graphene) determines the electron transfer between materials. When G is between FNA (α-Fe2O3 nanotube arrays) and Cu2O, the photogenerated electrons of FNA in the CB will use G as a bridge to transfer to the VB of Cu2O and combine with holes. The Z-scheme electron transfer mode contributes to the combination of electrons in the CB of Cu2O and O2 to form ˙O2−, and the holes on FNA VB will combine with H2O to generate ˙OH. When G is located on Cu2O, the charge transfer mechanism between FNA and Cu2O will be type-II. The redox sites do not have enough energy to form free radicals (˙O2− and ˙OH), which is not conducive to the further progress of the photocatalytic reaction. Therefore, in the process of constructing ternary materials, inserting a conductor between two photocatalysts may result in a composite material with high catalytic ability.

To further confirm whether the electronic transfer method is type-II or Z-scheme, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) testing techniques are commonly used.20,162,163 In the test, DMPO was used as a free radical scavenger to capture the free radicals generated during the photocatalysis process. Jiang et al.164 reported a α-Fe2O3/amine-RGO/CsPbBr3 photocatalytic system, in which the DMPO-˙OH signal was detected in the Fe2O3 system without the DMPO-˙O2− signal, but there was always only DMPO-˙O2− signal in the CsPbBr3 system. Also, both of these signals were present in the α-Fe2O3/amine-RGO/CsPbBr3 hybrid system. This can be explained by the fact that the oxidation site is in the VB of Fe2O3 and the reduction site is located in the CB of CsPbBr3 during the photocatalytic process with the composite materials, and thus the electronic transfer method is the Z-scheme mechanism. Zuo et al. also put proposed the type-II mechanism to explain the electron transfer path in the g-C3N4/Cu2O photocatalytic system according to the same judgment method.165 Giving the superiority of the Z-scheme mechanism, various Z-scheme mechanism materials have been constructed, and a variety of strategies as an auxiliary means have also been developed to prove the existence of the Z-scheme. Wang et al. explained via in situ XPS measurements that electrons flow under light conditions.166 In contrast, with no light conduction, the characteristic peaks of Zn and O shifted to the high binding energy direction, while the characteristic peaks of Cd and S shifted negatively towards the lower energy direction under light irradiation. This experimental phenomenon indicated that the electrons were transferred from ZnO to CdS under light irradiation. Moreover, according to the CB and VB position of ZnO and CdS, it can be explained that a Z-scheme is formed between ZnO and CdS. Fu et al. illustrated the electron transfer path via density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the work function (WF).167 Specifically, WF(WO3) and WF(g-C3N4) were calculated to be 6.32 and 4.18 eV, respectively, which indicated the electrons were transferred from g-C3N4 to WO3 until Fermi level equilibrium. An interfacial electric field can be constructed, and the photo-generated electron will transfer from WO3 to g-C3N4 under light irradiation. Subsequently, according to the EPR results, the electron transfer mechanism proved to be the Z-scheme mode. Zhou et al.168 calculated the carrier transfer time to further illuminate the existence of the Z-scheme charge transfer mode in MoSSe/WSeTe heterostructures by nonadiabatic molecular (NAMD) simulations. The results showed that the electron and hole transfer times (3.2 ps and 2.3 ps) obviously are slower than that of the interlayer e–h recombination (738 fs), which facilitated the formation of the Z-scheme mechanism.
4 Conclusions and outlook
The Cu2O semiconductor has been studied frequently and extensively in the field of photocatalysis due to its advantages. In this review, the nanostructure, modification method, and application of Cu2O were presented. The modes of electron transfer in the process of photocatalysis and the methods proving them were also discussed in detail. Although changing the shape of Cu2O and constructing hybrid materials can significantly improve the photocatalytic performance of Cu2O, there are still several problems and challenges to be solved.
(1) The investigation of the facet dependence of Cu2O should be more detailed. It is well known that the electronic structures and stability of different crystal planes of Cu2O are different, and the photocatalytic reaction usually occurs on the surface of the material. In the process of constructing heterogeneous materials, different contact conditions at the interface have a significant impact on electron transfer. Thus, it is necessary to systematically summarize the facet dependence of the Cu2O photocatalytic process.
(2) The light absorption rate of materials is also an important issue affecting their photocatalytic activity. The utilization rate of current photocatalysts in the visible light band is still low. The energy of solar radiation is mainly concentrated in the visible region, and thus increasing the absorption of visible light by photocatalysts will greatly enhance their photocatalytic activity.
(3) The electron transfer rate should also be considered. Both the electron transfer rate at the interface and surface will greatly affect the photocatalytic rate of the entire system. It has been shown that the addition of metals increases the electron transfer rate, but most of them are precious metals. Therefore, it is still necessary to find better alternatives.
(4) The easy photocorrosion of Cu2O is a fatal problem. The main method to solve this problem is to construct Cu2O heterogeneous materials, but the photocorrosion phenomenon of Cu2O still exists. Constructing a cuprous oxide core–shell structure is an effective method. However, if the shell layer is too thick, it will affect the absorption of light by Cu2O, and thus the construction of a thin layer is necessary to solve the photocorrosion problem.
(5) To apply a photocatalyst in real life, the experimental conditions need to be closer to the real state. For example, the experiment of photocatalytic total water splitting should be carried out, and degradation experiments should be performed in a multiple organics system. Thus, these are still many problems that require detailed research and solutions.
