    , Accepted 16th January 2019First published on 28th January 2019AbstractHigh-efficiency planar type perovskite solar cells were fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of SnO2 and subsequent annealing at 180 °C. As-dep. SnO2 layers prepared by post-annealing at 180 and 300 °C, respectively, were used as electron transporting layers (ETLs). ALD-TiO2 layers were also prepared by post annealing at 400 °C, and the thicknesses of all ETLs were around 12 nm. PL quenching, optical band gap measurement, UPS, and conductive AFM results show that SnO2 can more appropriately be used as an ETL compared to TiO2.
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased dramatically and has reached 23.3%.1 Such a highly increased PCE is attributed to the fascinating optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials, for example, a large absorption coefficient,2 low exciton binding energy3 and excellent charge transporting properties with long diffusion length.4–6 Easy accessibility of bandgaps and energy level control through ion substitution by a simple fabrication technique such as solution processes7,8 and subsequent thermal treatment at relatively lower temperatures make PSCs more attractive.9–12 Not only that, research on engineering of electron and hole transporting materials also contributes to PCE improvement.13,14 In addition, further strategies such as use of flexible, large area and Pb-free devices with non-toxic materials have been introduced recently.15,16
Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and C60 are mainly used as organic ETLs. Inorganic n-type oxides also show great advantages in terms of cost and long-term stability. Most of the highly efficient PSCs based on a compact and mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) bilayer are used as ETLs. However, when mp-TiO2 is used as an ETL, the synthesis process is rather complicated including thermal treatment at high temperatures (>500 °C) and it negatively affects the device stability under illumination with ultraviolet (UV) light,17 and also leads to charge accumulation at the interface caused by its low electron mobility. Research on other oxides such as ZnO,18,19 Zn2SnO4,20 BaSnO321 and SnO222 has been carried out accordingly; among these SnO2 is the most promising material in PSCs as an ETL because of its deep conduction band (CB) with good energy level alignment, high bulk electron mobility, wide optical band gap, synthesis process at low temperature and excellent chemical stability.23 Most of the highly efficient PSCs based on SnO2 ETLs have a planar structure, so their fabrication process is much simpler than that of the mesoscopic structured ones even at low process temperatures. Many different fabrication methods were adopted to synthesize SnO2 ETLs, i.e., solution processes,24 the dual-fuel combustion method,25 nanoparticle synthesis methods,26,27 e-beam evaporation,28 and plasma-assisted oxidation.29,30 Thickness control of ETLs in most processes is restricted to a few tens of nanometers, due to the limitation of uniform film coverages. For transmission of light and transporting carriers without any optical and electrical loss, ALD allows highly conformal and dense films to be deposited even on rough surfaces such as fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) with a sub-nanometre scale and enables deposition on a large area due to self-limiting surface chemistry.
Deposition of SnO2 through ALD has already been done for efficient PSCs. Baena et al. fabricated planar PSCs based on ALD-ETLs with TiO2 and SnO2 and reported the misalignment of the CB between TiO2 and perovskite, causing undesirable accumulation of photogenerated charges at the interfaces, meanwhile, the CB of SnO2 was aligned appropriately and photogenerated electrons were extracted efficiently.31 Wang et al. fabricated PSCs based on SnO2 films deposited by plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) at low temperature showing suitable properties as ETLs and reported that the performance of PSCs was enhanced by passivating the surfaces of SnO2 with C60-self-assembled monolayers and low-temperature thermal annealing.32,33 Aygüler et al. reported that the Fermi level of ALD-SnO2 films varies depending on the post-annealing temperature, resulting in a variation of energy difference between SnO2 and perovskite, and device performances. The hysteresis index is also affected by charge accumulation caused by the alignment of energy levels.34 Lee et al. reported ALD-SnO2 layers self-passivated by a residual precursor improving the device performance due to the enhancement of the hole blocking ability.35 Since high quality thin films can be synthesized by ALD at low temperature, ALD-SnO2 is, therefore, a greatly advantageous process for deposition on top of the perovskite layers, and consequently it was used not only in n–i–p structures, but also in p–i–n structures as an impermeable ETL acting as a barrier layer against external environments such as H2O, O2 and heat, resulting in an astonishing improvement of device stability.36–38
In this study, we have fabricated planar PSCs based on methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and confirmed that SnO2 as an ETL deposited by thermal ALD is energetically and electrically advantageous compared to TiO2. SnO2 with post-annealing at high temperatures showed highly conductive leakage paths measured by conductive-atomic force microscopy (c-AFM), resulting in a poor hole blocking ability, accelerating charge recombination at the interface of perovskite and ETL and adversely affecting the performance of PSCs. As a result, ALD SnO2 as an ETL with low-temperature heat treatment (i.e., 180 °C) is essential for achieving high PCEs in PSCs.
SnO2 and TiO2 deposited via ALD SnO2 layers without post-annealing (as-dep) and with post-annealing at 180 and 300 °C (@180 °C and @300 °C), respectively, were used in this study. TiO2 layers were used with post annealing treatment at 400 °C (c-TiO2), and all the thicknesses of the ETLs were around 12 nm. The configuration of n–i–p planar PSCs with MAPbI3 is shown with a corresponding cross-sectional image of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Fig. 1(a)). In addition, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra in Fig. 1(b) show an effect on extracting photo-generated electrons from perovskite when using different ETLs. Insulating Al2O3 layers deposited onto an FTO substrate were used in this experiment (Fig. S1, ESI†), and PL quenching was only observed with the deposition of SnO2 and c-TiO2 layers. Effective quenching of SnO2 based ETLs can be observed in the PL spectra (∼94%) compared to the perovskite one; on the other hand, photo-excited electrons were only slightly quenched (∼18%) in c-TiO2 based devices, demonstrating that SnO2 can be used appropriately as an ETL. As a result, the PCEs shown in the J–V curve (Fig. 1(c)) of SnO2 based PSCs are greatly improved compared to the c-TiO2 based ones due to the superior electron extracting and transporting properties. 15 PSCs based on each ETL were fabricated and measured as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and the excellent device performances are summarized in Table 1. Obviously, PSCs based on SnO2@180 °C show not only the highest PCE, but also better reproducibility.

ALD-SnO2/TiO2 and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) were used as electron and hole transporting layers, respectively. Each layer of ALD films, perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD has thickness of 12, 380 and 220 nm. In addition, Ag electrodes of 100 nm thickness were deposited by thermal evaporation. Compact and uniform dense layers of the as-deposited ALD films can be observed.

c-TiO2-based PSCs showed lower PCE than SnO2 ones, especially the J–V curve characteristic of an S-shape, which is due to high series resistance. However, SnO2-based PSCs show higher PCE than TiO2. PSCs based on SnO2@180 °C compared to the as-dep SnO2 based PSCs show an increase in performance due to the enhanced electrical properties through thermal annealing. However, in the case of PSCs based on SnO2@300 °C reduced Voc and FF are observed, indicating that the recombination is increased at the interface due to the decrease of the carrier blocking properties, moreover, the same tendency was observed even in PSCs based on SnO2 through solution processes.39

Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns of SnO2 and TiO2 films deposited onto Si with a thickness of 40 nm. Both as-dep. SnO2 and TiO2 are amorphous and crystallized at 300 and 400 °C, respectively. All the GIXRD peaks of the SnO2 and TiO2 films annealed at 300 and 400 °C were assigned as tetragonal SnO2 and anatase TiO2, respectively. SnO2@300 °C layers were crystallized with nanocrystallites, which was indicated by a broad peak in XRD patterns, meanwhile, the XRD patterns of c-TiO2 are sharper without any residual peak indicating high quality films by ALD. Optical bandgaps as shown in Fig. 2(c) and Fig. S3 (ESI†) of ETLs and MAPbI3 were calculated based on the absorption spectra measured by UV-visible spectroscopy, corresponding reasonably with the reported values.40,41 The transmittance of each film was measured as shown in Fig. 2(d). In the visible region (400–700 nm), SnO2 showed characteristics of high transparency (>97%) regardless of post-annealing treatment and TiO2 has a slightly lower transmittance due to a relatively small band gap compared to SnO2, but has a transmission characteristic of 90% or more, indicating that both materials can be optically used as ETLs in PSCs.

Diffraction peak of Si (311) from substrate at 56.10° was used as internal reference. (c) Tauc plot of absorption coefficient (α2) vs. photon energy (hν) to determine the band gap (Eg) of different SnO2 and c-TiO2 films as shown in the inset. Optical band gap of each as-dep SnO2, SnO2@180 °C, SnO2@300 °C and c-TiO2 equals 3.98, 3.97, 3.95 and 3.31 eV, respectively. (d) Optical transmittance spectra of 12 nm SnO2 and TiO2 films deposited onto glass, indicating highly transparent ETLs in a broad range of wavelengths (400–900 nm). 

Fig. 3 shows topographic images captured using an AFM and the corresponding current maps measured by c-AFM. Since thin films were deposited on FTO as shown in FESEM images (Fig. S4, ESI†), a similar topographic image was observed in AFM measurement shown in Fig. 3(a)–(e), indicating bare-FTO and each ETL. Meanwhile, a different tendency was observed in the corresponding current maps; a leakage current in a level of 100 nA flows through FTO as shown in Fig. 3(f). In addition, a leakage current of up to 12.84 nA was obtained in SnO2@300 °C films shown in Fig. 3(i), caused by the enhanced conductivity, and not pinholes. On the other hand, no leakage current was observed in Fig. 3(g), (h) and (i), corresponding to as-dep SnO2, SnO2@180 °C and c-TiO2, respectively, indicating that dense and uniform films were deposited by the ALD process.

Surface morphologies ((b), (c), (d) and (e)) and leakage current maps ((g), (h), (i) and (j)) of as-dep SnO2, SnO2@180 °C, SnO2@300 °C and c-TiO2, respectively. All samples are measured in a constant force mode (force ref.: −1.0 nN, scan speed: 0.83 Hz, applied bias: 0.2 V) of AFM. 
Despite the deposition of high quality films via ALD, to investigate the reason for low PCE properties in PSCs based on TiO2, the energy levels of ETLs and perovskite were measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and the corresponding schematics of the energy band alignment are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) and Fig. 4(a). As a result, there is a misalignment of the CB with an energy barrier of 0.09 eV between TiO2 and MAPbI3, meanwhile, the CB of SnO2 is deeper than that of MAPbI3, regardless of the post-annealing treatment. Such a favourable band alignment of SnO2 implies that photoexcited electrons are appropriately extracted to SnO2 with the same tendency as shown in the PL spectra (Fig. 1(b)) and reported results in the literature.31

(c) The DC conductivity of the ETL films of ETLs was determined from their MIM devices. The conductivity is 3.8 × 10−3, 7.0 × 10−3, 9.3 × 10−3, and 1.5 × 10−2 mS cm−1 for c-TiO2, as-dep SnO2, SnO2@180 °C and SnO2@300 °C, respectively. 
The influence of the charge blocking ability according to different ETLs on device performance can be evaluated by CV measurements.42 According to the result in Fig. 4(b), the current density of FTO is the highest, which means poor hole blocking properties, and in the case of as-dep SnO2, SnO2@180 °C, and c-TiO2, no current density was detected due to the superior hole blocking ability. Meanwhile, in the case of SnO2@300 °C, small current density caused by less hole blocking properties in CV measurements is detected, and the result matches well with the current map of c-AFM in Fig. 3(i). In addition, DC conductivity in Fig. 4(c) of ALD films was measured from MIM devices;43 the lowest electrical conductivity was measured in TiO2 films and the conductivity increased with increasing post-annealing temperatures for SnO2 films, and consequentially the highest conductivity was measured in SnO2@300 °C. Thus, higher PCEs of SnO2@180 °C based PSCs than those of as-dep based PSCs are due to the enhanced electron transporting properties which were attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity and are consistent with the lowest PCE of c-TiO2 based PSCs due to the lower conductivity and CB misalignment shown in the J–V curve (Fig. 1(c)). SnO2@300 °C films show the highest conductivity which is favorable for electron transport, nevertheless, PCE of the devices based on SnO2@300 °C films was lower because of poor hole blocking ability.
SnO2 has been reported to have an adverse effect on device performance, despite the fact that the electrical conductivity increased with crystallization. We expect the reason to be the diffusion of F ions from FTO substrates during the annealing process at high temperatures, rendering the localized region of the degenerated states acting as recombination centers shown in the current map (Fig. 3(i)), although F was not detected through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Also, we assumed that, because the tiny signal of F 1s was detected even in the case FTO, the doped amount is too small to detect.
In conclusion, ALD is a powerful tool to deposit high-quality films as ETLs in PSCs. Planar type of PSCs based on ALD-SnO2 subsequently annealed at 180 °C as ETL showed high PCE (∼18.3%) with excellent reproducibility. We demonstrated that ALD-SnO2 is the most promising material in PSCs as an ETL because of its deep conduction band (CB) with good energy level alignment with perovskite, high bulk electron mobility, wide optical band gap and synthesis process at low temperature. ALD-SnO2 can be a critical ETL in future commercially available PSCs.

ALD-SnO2/TiO2 and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) were used as electron and hole transporting layers, respectively. Each layer of ALD films, perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD has thickness of 12, 380 and 220 nm. In addition, Ag electrodes of 100 nm thickness were deposited by thermal evaporation. Compact and uniform dense layers of the as-deposited ALD films can be observed. (b) Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of devices based on different ETLs that were deposited on glass/FTO/ALD-Al2O3 with excitation at 464 nm. (c) J–V curve of PSCs based on different ETLs measured under 1.5 AM illumination (100 mW cm−2).	 

as-dep SnO2	1.03	21.5	71.2	15.8
SnO2@180 °C	1.07	22.6	75.6	18.3
SnO2@300 °C	1.00	21.9	65.9	14.5
c-TiO2	0.96	21.7	42.2	8.8

 	Fig. 2  (a) GIXRD patterns of SnO2 films deposited on Si without and with post-annealing treatment. (b) GIXRD patterns of TiO2 films deposited on the Si wafer. Diffraction peak of Si (311) from substrate at 56.10° was used as internal reference. (c) Tauc plot of absorption coefficient (α2) vs. photon energy (hν) to determine the band gap (Eg) of different SnO2 and c-TiO2 films as shown in the inset. Optical band gap of each as-dep SnO2, SnO2@180 °C, SnO2@300 °C and c-TiO2 equals 3.98, 3.97, 3.95 and 3.31 eV, respectively. (d) Optical transmittance spectra of 12 nm SnO2 and TiO2 films deposited onto glass, indicating highly transparent ETLs in a broad range of wavelengths (400–900 nm).	 

 	Fig. 3  AFM and c-AFM images of FTO and FTO/ETL films. Surface morphology and leakage current maps of bare FTO ((a) and (f)). Surface morphologies ((b), (c), (d) and (e)) and leakage current maps ((g), (h), (i) and (j)) of as-dep SnO2, SnO2@180 °C, SnO2@300 °C and c-TiO2, respectively. All samples are measured in a constant force mode (force ref.: −1.0 nN, scan speed: 0.83 Hz, applied bias: 0.2 V) of AFM.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Schematic diagram of the energy band level of different ETLs and MAPbI3 and energy difference (ΔE) of conduction band levels. (b) Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve of each ETL. (c) The DC conductivity of the ETL films of ETLs was determined from their MIM devices. The conductivity is 3.8 × 10−3, 7.0 × 10−3, 9.3 × 10−3, and 1.5 × 10−2 mS cm−1 for c-TiO2, as-dep SnO2, SnO2@180 °C and SnO2@300 °C, respectively.
