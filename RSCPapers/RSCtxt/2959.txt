    First published on 23rd March 2022AbstractOrganic molecular semiconductors have been paid great attention due to their advantages of low-temperature processability, low fabrication cost, good flexibility, and excellent electronic properties. As a typical example of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors, a single crystal of pentacene shows a high mobility of up to 40 cm2 V−1 s−1, indicating its potential application in organic electronics. However, the photo- and optical instabilities of pentacene make it unsuitable for commercial applications. But, molecular engineering, for both the five-ring-fused building block and side chains, has been performed to improve the stability of materials as well as maintain high mobility. Here, several groups (thiophenes, pyrroles, furans, etc.) are introduced to design and replace one or more benzene rings of pentacene and construct novel five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. In this review article, ∼500 five-ring-fused organic prototype molecules and their derivatives are summarized to provide a general understanding of this catalogue material for application in organic field-effect transistors. The results indicate that many five-ring-fused organic semiconductors can achieve high mobilities of more than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1, and a hole mobility of up to 18.9 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be obtained, while an electron mobility of 27.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be achieved in five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. The HOMO–LUMO levels, the synthesis process, the molecular packing, and the side-chain engineering of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors are analyzed. The current problems, conclusions, and perspectives are also provided.

1. Introduction
Organic semiconductors have attracted great attention in recent years due to their unique advantages of low processing temperature, high quantum yields, low fabrication cost, and good mechanical flexibility compared with traditional inorganic semiconductors.1–10 Organic semiconductors are promising for many potential applications, including phototransistors,11,12 integrated circuits,13–15 displays,16–18 electronic papers,19,20 radio frequency identification (RFID) tags,21,22 sensors,23–26 electronic skins,27–29 storage devices,30–32 molecular magnets,33–35 lasers36–38 and masers.39,40 Synthetic chemists have created a large library of organic semiconductors with excellent electronic properties, such as oligothiophenes,41,42 heteroacenes,43–46 thienoacenes,47,48 tetrathiafulvalenes,49,50 metal phthalocyanines,51–53 porphyrins,54,55 fullerenes,56,57 and conjugated polymers.58–60 Among them, some linearly condensed acenes present high mobilities owing to their extended π-conjugation and enhanced intermolecular π–π overlapping.61,62 With the increase of the number of fused rings, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels are lowered, and the conjugation length is also increased. It is supposed that the charge carrier mobility of the linearly condensed acenes will be increased with the increase of the number of fused rings. However, extra fused rings may induce chemical instability of molecular structure and decrease solubility in solvents as well as the high fabrication cost of the complicated synthesis routes. So far, five linearly condensed rings have been paid the most attention, and one typical prototype, pentacene, has obtained extraordinary success and been extensively investigated.62,63 For instance, a single crystal of pentacene shows a high hole mobility of up to 40 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature.64,65Fig. 1 shows the statistics of the relationship between the highest reported single-crystal mobility and the number of fused benzene rings. For linearly fused rings, many different research groups have obtained a single-crystal mobility of pentacene of >1 cm2 V−1 s−1, although they have applied different experimental equipment or device techniques (Fig. 1a). For angularly fused rings, it is a little different from the results of linearly fused rings. The reported single-crystal mobility of angularly fused rings is not so different from each other. It is worth noting that the thin-film mobility66,67 of [6]phenacene is higher than the single-crystal mobility68 due to the bad crystallization of the material. It is also reported that the thin-film mobility of [8]phenacene can be higher than 10 cm2 V−1 s−1via device optimization.69 To consider the synthesis cost, the expected performance, and the material stability, the most recent results have been focused on five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. It is necessary to summarize all the state-of-the-art results, which can provide a general understanding of this field. The details of Fig. 1 are listed in Table S1 of the ESI.†

Pentacene is a representative five-ring-fused polycyclic molecule with a record value of single-crystal mobility. However, due to the presence of highly reactive 7- and 13-positions, pentacene is susceptible to the Diels–Alder reaction with oxygen in an easily oxidized state in an atmospheric environment.70 Also, the insolubility of pentacene in some organic solvents makes it difficult for it to be solution-processed. As a possible solution, molecular engineering can be used to improve the solubility and stability of the material as well as maintain good charge transport properties. For example, some side-chain groups can be decorated on the backbone of pentacene, such as four-membered rings (cyclobuta-1,3-diene), five-membered rings (thiophene, pyrrole, furan, etc.), six-membered rings (pyridine, pyrazine, etc.), and seven-membered rings (cyclohepta-1,3,5-triene, etc.), to replace one or more benzene rings of pentacene and realize different functionalities. The representative reported functional groups from four-membered -rings to seven-membered rings are listed in Fig. 2. Several functionalities can be realized as follows. (1) The oxidation-resistance can be improved by the introduction of functional groups, such as thiophene, pyrrole, and furan groups. The HOMO levels have been lowered, and the band gap has been widened. (2) Electron-deficient groups such as F–, Cl– and CN– can be introduced to realize electron transport.15,71–76 (3) A suitable length of alkyl groups can be added to the main building block to improve the solubility as well as maintain good mobility. (4) Polymerization based on the main building block of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors can be performed to obtain good performance. It should be noted that both non-aromatic and aromatic rings can be fused and these five-ring-fused organic semiconductors present field-effect behavior; also, the statistics of molecules with mobilities higher than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 will be presented at the end with a general discussion about which replaced one will behave better (aromatic or non-aromatic rings).

Pentacene and its derivatives (such as 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene, TIPS-pentacene) have been extensively discussed in several previous reviews.62,77 To avoid unnecessary repetition, this review mainly focuses on the structure–property correlation in five-ring-fused organic semiconductors, including the functional substitution of the pentacene backbone and side chains. We will discuss various organic prototypes of five-ring-fused organic molecules that have been discovered to exhibit high mobility, good solution processability, and good environmental stability.
Based on the reported results of ∼500 five-ring-fused organic molecules, general understandings can be summarized as follows. (1) High mobility five-ring-fused organic semiconductors can be obtained by molecular design. Many theoretical calculations based on five-ring-fused molecules reveal their promising application in organic electronics.74,75,78–97 The experimental results indicate that the mobilities of many five-ring-fused organic semiconductors can be larger than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1, and those of some typical molecules can be larger than 10 cm2 V−1 s−1.98–101 The hole mobility of the best p-type semiconductor can be as high as 18.9 cm2 V−1 s−1,98 while the best n-type semiconductor can achieve an electron mobility of 27.8 cm2 V−1 s−1.99 The introduction of thiophene groups is widely investigated, and many possibilities of benzene replacements, from one thiophene to five thiophenes, can be achieved. (2) The introduction of side-chain groups such as alkyl groups with appropriate chain length can efficiently improve the solution processability. For different building blocks of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors, the different chain lengths of alkyl groups can be selected to get the best performance. The detailed statistics of the alkyl groups’ dependence on mobility can be seen in the following discussion. (3) Better air stability can be obtained for some five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. The results indicate that the HOMO levels of many five-ring-fused organic semiconductors are lowered to improve material stability. (4) The low fabrication cost can be realized in some five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. Although pentacene shows very high mobility, the fabrication cost is too high to meet the commercial requirement. According to the website of Sigma Aldrich, it takes more than US$400 to purchase 1 g pentacene (sublimation grade). It is reasonable to decrease the fabrication cost. One possible way is to simplify the synthesis steps (within three steps) and select cheap source materials. Our statistics indicate that some five-ring-fused molecules with mobilities of more than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be obtained within three steps, showing a great advantage of large-scale synthesis with low fabrication cost. (5) The statistical data indicate that higher mobilities can be obtained in linear aromatic-ring-fused organic small molecules. Seven small molecules present mobilities of higher than 10 cm2 V−1 s−1, in which 100% comes from linear aromatic-ring-fused organic small molecules. When extending the research objectives to 60 molecules with mobilities higher than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1, we can conclude that more than 80% of the molecules have such features. This can be used as a clue to design novel five-ring-fused organic molecules towards high performance.
In this review article, ∼500 five-ring-fused organic molecules are first introduced. Then, based on the statistical results of the device performance, the HOMO–LUMO engineering, chemical synthesis, molecular packing, side-chain engineering, and isomeric effect of five-ring-fused organic molecules are discussed to give us a comprehensive understanding of the catalogic materials. The current problems, the summary, and the perspectives are also provided.
2. Indenofluorene (IF) and its derivatives
Indenofluorenes (IFs) are famous for their efficient emission properties.102,103 In the molecular structure of IF (001, Fig. 3),104 the benzene ring is displaced by a five-carbon ring, which means that IF has two fewer π electrons than pentacene. Similar to the molecular structure of pentacene, IF is a rigid linear, planar molecule with a dense molecular packing. The central IF basic unit still has a herringbone-like packing with adjacent four IF molecules, and the π–π overlaps between two vertical IF molecules are enhanced.104 IF-based small molecules and polymers are introduced as follows.

2.1 Small molecules of IF and its derivatives
The molecular design principles for IF derivatives are based on a balance between good emission efficiency and good mobility. No field-effect performance is observed in the IF building block (001, Fig. 3). However, organic field-effect transistors based on thin films or single crystals of some IF derivatives were reported recently.90,105–133 For example, the hydrogen atoms of the 2- and 8-positions are replaced with two thiophene units (DTIF, 002, Fig. 3), and vacuum deposited thin films of DTIF present a hole mobility of 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1.122 When the thiophene units are replaced with two benzene rings (DPIF, 003, Fig. 3), thin films of DPIF are reported as an emitter material used in a permeable transistor.125
Twelve positions can be decorated with different side chains in IFs (001, Fig. 3),104 and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-positions and 7-, 8-, 9-, and 10-positions are popular. When halogen atoms (F–, Cl–, Br–, etc.) are adorned in these positions, electron transport properties are found in these IF derivatives. For example, when two fluorine (F–) atoms are decorated in the 2- and 8-positions of IF, thin films of compound 013 (Fig. 3) can be thermally evaporated on a hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)-modified silicon substrate with an electron mobility of 0.17 cm2 V−1 s−1.129 The fluorination in the 1-, 2-, 3-, 7-, 8-, and 9-positions of IF can improve electron transport, and compound 024 (Fig. 3) can obtain an electron mobility of 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1.127 When F– is changed to Cl– or Br–, the electron mobilities of compounds 014 and 015 (Fig. 3) are measured to be 1.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.9 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.129 No evidence shows that a further increase of the numbers of fluorine atoms in IF derivatives will further increase the electron mobilities.15,107,119,127,129 However, higher electron transport rates are found in IF derivatives with symmetrical side chains,129 while the introduction of unsymmetrical side chains results in lower electron mobilities.110
For the 5- and 11-positions of IF, alkyl groups132 or iodine119 can be introduced onto the IF building block to increase the solubility, and electron mobilities in the range 10−5–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 are observed. Some other soluble groups such as SiMe3 (026, Fig. 3), SiPr3 (027, Fig. 3), and SiPh3 (028, Fig. 3) can also be decorated at the 5- and 11-positions of IF, making the IFs solution-processable with enhanced intermolecular π–π interactions. The calculation results based on Marcus-Hush theory reveal that compounds 026–028 exhibit anisotropic properties, and the maximum electron mobility of 0.485 cm2 V−1 s−1 is observed in compound 027.115
For the 6- and 12-positions of IF, double bonds (such as CC groups) are normally connected with five-carbon rings.108 It should be kept in mind that an IF derivative with the introduction of an enhanced π-extended tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) unit (IF-TTF, 006, Fig. 3) displays stronger π–π, S⋯S, H⋯H, and C–H⋯π interactions. According to a drop cast method, IF-TTF can form ribbon-like single crystals with two different phases in different solvents are used. The molecular packings of α-phase and β-phase IF-TTF single crystals are shown in Fig. 4. A single crystal of α-phase IF-TTF has a higher hole mobility of 1.44 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the β-phase shows a lower mobility of 0.28 cm2 V−1 s−1, leading to phase-dependent charge transport properties.108 The results also confirm that the charge transport direction of the highest mobility in α-phase IF-TTF is actually along the shortest axis (a-axis) of the molecules.

Some electron-withdrawing groups, such as dicyanovinylene groups126 and carbonyl groups,119 can be introduced at the 6- and 12-positions of the IF building block to stabilize the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy and increase the electron affinity. Consequently, an ambipolar or n-type transport can be expected in some IF derivatives. For example, dicyanovinylene groups are introduced at the 6- and 12-positions of IF; ambipolar transport (008,116009,132Fig. 3) and pure electron transport (007,111,131,132011,132034,110035,110Fig. 3) are observed. A solution-shearing method was used to fabricate thin films of 2OD-TTIFDM (008, Fig. 3), which can achieve a hole mobility of 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1.116 Thin films of TIFDMT (007, Fig. 3) via a spin coating technology can achieve an electron mobility of 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1.132
Similar to dicyanovinylene groups, carbonyl groups can also be introduced at the 6- and 12-positions of IFs (012–030, Fig. 3); ambipolar transport (017,112019,113020,132021,113,116030,132Fig. 3) and n-type transport (013–015,15,129023–028,15,115,119,127,132Fig. 3) can also be found. The best ambipolar performance in this series was observed in 2EH-TIFDKT (019, Fig. 3) solution-sheared thin films, in which the hole mobility and electron mobility were 0.02 and 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.113
Hole transport is also found in DBA-IFD (018, Fig. 3)112 and compound 022 (Fig. 3).132 The introduction of mixed dicyanovinylene and dicyanovinylene groups results in reduced mobility (035, Fig. 3).110 It should be pointed out that Zhang et al. introduced heteroatom-linked side chains at the 2- and 8-positions, and the performance of the IF derivative could be dramatically increased from a low mobility of ∼10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 (016, Fig. 3)112 to balanced ambipolar behavior (a hole mobility of 0.71 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 0.65 cm2 V−1 s−1, 017, Fig. 3)112 by side-chain engineering of butylthio decoration. Furthermore, dialkylamino side chains can be added, and the hole mobility of DBA-IFD (018, Fig. 3) can be as high as 1.03 cm2 V−1 s−1 although the electron transport disappears.112
Benzene rings can be fused into the middle benzene ring of IF to form rubicene (031, Fig. 3)109 and derivatives (032 and 033, Fig. 3).109 In this case, fusing benzene rings in the middle benzene ring of IF can be regarded as another side-chain engineering technique since the main building unit is still IF. Thin films of rubicene obtained via vacuum deposition can achieve a hole mobility of ∼0.32 cm2 V−1 s−1.128 The theoretical calculation based on the molecular structure of fully fluorinated rubicene (6F-rubicene, 032, Fig. 3) reveals ambipolar transport with a hole mobility of 5.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1.109 The performance statistics of small molecules of IF and its derivatives in Fig. 3 are listed in Table S2 of the ESI.†
2.2 Polymers based on IF and its derivatives
Polymers based on IF and its derivatives have been reported recently (037–055, Fig. 5).131,132,134–140 Similar to IF based small molecules, alkyl groups (037–040,132047–055,134,135,138–140Fig. 5), dicyanovinylene groups (041–044,132Fig. 5) or carbonyl groups (045 and 046,132Fig. 5) can be decorated on the IF building blocks. Furthermore, thiophene (039–048, Fig. 5) and benzene (049–055, Fig. 5) rings are also functionally co-polymerized. The hole mobilities of most of these IF-based polymers range from 10−6 to 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, comparable with IF based small molecules.132,134–136,140 The maximum hole mobility of 0.67 cm2 V−1 s−1 is reported for compound 050 (Fig. 5), in which the indenofluorenephenanthrene co-polymerized semiconductor is amorphously conjugated.138 It is attributed to the low energetic disorder along the interface between the semiconductor and insulator and strong intermolecular coupling.138 The performance statistics of polymers based on IF and its derivatives in Fig. 5 are listed in Table S3 of the ESI.†

In summary, as a typical photoemission material, IF can be used as a prototype building block to construct both small molecules and polymers that can be applied in organic field-effect transistors. Based on the analysis of IF and its derivatives, some points can be addressed as follows. (1) A high hole mobility of 1.44 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be obtained in α-phase IF-TTF single crystals, while balanced ambipolar transport is observed in BT-IFD (hole mobility: 0.71 cm2 V−1 s−1; electron mobility: 0.65 cm2 V−1 s−1). Although some molecules have low mobilities, there is space to improve the performance of IF and its derivatives for application in organic electronics. (2) Different functional side chains can be introduced at the twelve positions of the IF building block. p-Type, ambipolar, and n-type transport are observed in IF derivatives, making it possible to design high-performance organic semiconductors with low fabrication costs. IF and its derivatives can be applied in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),102 OFETs,15 and organic solar cells (OSCs),141,142 and the following research topics based on IF and its derivatives can be focused on the design and fabrication of bifunctional or multifunctional materials since some IF-based molecules show excellent photoemission properties as well as semiconducting behavior.
3. Hybrids between acenes and thiophenes
Thiophene is a well-known structural unit with an extended π-electron system that may form a large π-conjugated molecular channel. Thiophene rings are good substitutes of benzene rings because of the structural similarity between thiophene and benzene and better stability against photo-oxidation. Fused thiophene rings with acenes can form a rigid and planar configuration and induce a stronger π–π stacking for efficient charge transport. This is a good way to increase the stability as well as realize an efficient conjugation in comparison with pure linearly fused acenes.
3.1 Five-ring-fused molecules based on one thiophene ring and four benzene rings
Pentacene is an air- and light-sensitive molecule and experiences electrical degradation when exposed to air.70 One possible solution for improving material stability is to lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the molecule by molecular design or engineering. For example, one benzene of heteroaromatic rings can be replaced with one thiophene ring. One thiophene ring can be experimentally fused into benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, or tetracene building blocks to form different linear five-ring-fused hybrid structures (056–084, Fig. 6). For example, a thiophene ring can be fused at one end of tetracene to form an unsymmetrical molecule of tetraceno[2,3-b]thiophene (TCT, 056, Fig. 6)143–146 and its derivatives (057–071, Fig. 6).76,88,144,147–150 In 2006, Bao et al. synthesized TCT by simply reducing the precursor of 2-(trimethylsilylmethyl)-3-(trimethylammonium)-thiophene iodide, which can be obtained via the one-step process of the Diels–Alder reaction.143 TCT has a slightly higher oxidation potential than pentacene, and has a conjugation length between tetracene and pentacene. TCT has a similar molecular packing to pentacene, and the introduction of an unsymmetrical thiophene unit makes it form a small dipole moment that enhances intermolecular interactions.144 Thermally-evaporated thin films of TCT can achieve a hole mobility of up to 0.55 cm2 V−1 s−1.146

In addition to adjusting the electronic structures and properties by changing the core structure, another efficient way is side-chain engineering. Side-chain groups such as halogen atoms (058–061,147–149063,147Fig. 6) and alkyl side chains (062,148064,144Fig. 6) can be connected to the thiophene unit of TCT to balance between the solution processability and the mobility. For example, a linear hexyl group substitution (062, Fig. 6) of TCT can result in a hole mobility of 0.23 cm2 V−1 s−1,148 and a longer linear decyl group substitution (064, Fig. 6) of TCT will give a lower mobility of 0.064 cm2 V−1 s−1.144
The introduction of the Br– group (058, Fig. 6) on one side of TCT can induce a higher mobility of 0.79 cm2 V−1 s−1.148 On the other side, four positions of F– (057,147059,147061,147063,147068,76,149071,147Fig. 6) or Cl– (069,76,88Fig. 6) displacement located at the end of the benzene of TCT can lower the molecular orbital energy levels. However, compounds 057, 059, 061, and 063 have a mobility range of ∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 or below.147
The alkynyl substitution at the C-6/C-13 positions of pentacene will improve the material solubility and stability by lowering the LUMO level since it can reduce the degree of charge transfer from photoexcited substituted pentacene to oxygen molecules and hinder the process of photo-oxidation. For example, TIPS-pentacene can improve solubility by introducing bulky triisopropylsilyl substituents into the pentacene building unit and achieve a balanced mobility.151 Similarly, TIPS, triethylsilyl (TES), and trimethylsilyl (TMS) can be substituted into the main building block of TCT. The mobility of TIPSEthiotet (065, Fig. 6) can be up to 0.801 cm2 V−1 s−1, and TESEthiotet (066, Fig. 6) has a lower mobility of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while TMSEthiotet (067, Fig. 6) shows a hole mobility of 6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.150 The main difference among the three molecules is that TIPSEthiotet can form a 2-D π-stack, while TESEthiotet and TMSEthiotet form a 1-D slip stack.150 TIPSEthiotetF4 (068, Fig. 6) with TIPS substitution at the C-6/C-13 positions of TCT and replacement of four fluorine atoms at the right benzene ring of TCT can obtain ambipolar transport with an improved electron mobility of 0.216 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a hole mobility of 0.0569 cm2 V−1 s−1.149
Another possibility of fusing one thiophene unit into acenes is the displacement of the second (072–078, Fig. 6)152–155 or the third (079–084, Fig. 6)156–159 benzene ring of pentacene. The former example is anthra[2,3-b]benzo[d]thiophene (ABT, 072, Fig. 6), which is developed by Liu et al.152,153 In the molecular structure of ABT, in addition to the π–π interactions of fused benzenes, the intermolecular S⋯S and S–π interactions of ABT form another charge transfer channel. The oxidation potential of ABT is higher than that of pentacene, and thin films of ABT present a hole mobility of 0.41 cm2 V−1 s−1.152,153 The authors further introduced the methyl group into ABT using the Friedel–Crafts acylation reaction, which may induce two isomers. The methyl group can be located in either the 6- or 7-position (073 and 074, Fig. 6).154 Although it is difficult to distinguish compounds 073 and 074 by chemical purification, the microribbon of the mixed Me-ABT made via solution self-assembly can give a high hole mobility of up to 1.66 cm2 V−1 s−1.154 Also, Yu et al. introduced TIPS and TMS into the fourth benzene ring of ABT and C-ABT to form four similar compounds: TIPS-ABT (075, Fig. 6), TIPS-CABT (076, Fig. 6), TMS-ABT (077, Fig. 6), and TMS-CABT (078, Fig. 6).155 The hole mobilities of TIPS-ABT (075, Fig. 6) and TMS-ABT (077, Fig. 6) were measured to be 2.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.155 Two phases of TIPS-ABT single crystals can be obtained by the liquid–liquid diffusion method: orange block crystal of TIPS-ABT-1 and yellow block crystal of TIPS-ABT-2. The theoretical calculations based on different phases of single-crystal structures indicate that a higher mobility of ∼1.74 cm2 V−1 s−1 is obtained from TIPS-ABT-1, while a lower value of 0.09 cm2 V−1 s−1 is observed from TIPS-ABT-2, showing the effect of molecular conformational control on their charge transport properties.155 Similarly, the four chlorine atoms’ displacement at the end of the benzene ring of TIPS-ABT and TMS-ABT can improve the hole mobilities of TIPS-CABT (0.012 cm2 V−1 s−1, 076, Fig. 6) and TMS-CABT (7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 078, Fig. 6).155

The latter example is that the thiophene ring was fused into two naphthalene molecules to form a symmetrical V-shaped molecule, dinaphtho[2,3-b:2,3-d]thiophene (DNT-V, 079, Fig. 6)156 and dinaphtho[1,2-b:2,1-d]thiophene (DNT-W, 083, Fig. 6).158 DNT-V is a linearly conjugated molecule, while DNT-W is a phenacene-type molecule. As shown in Fig. 7, the introduction of thiophene at the middle position can form a bent conformation (DNT-V), in which the angle between two naphthalene rings is 13.88°. DNT-V shows a herringbone packing. The hole mobilities of DNT-V and DNT-W are 1.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.156,158 The introduction of alkyl groups into DNT-V (C6-DNT-VW, 081, Fig. 6) results in a good solubility in solution, and C6-DNT-VW single crystals made from solution can achieve a higher mobility of 9.5 cm2 V−1 s−1.156 It is also the highest value of this catalog. The longer alkyl groups at both ends of DNT-V (C10-DNT-VW, 082, Fig. 6) give a reduced mobility of 6.5 cm2 V−1 s−1.156

3.2 Five-ring-fused molecules based on two thiophene rings and three benzene rings
Two thiophene rings can be either adorned on both sides of the anthracene building block (085–150, Fig. 8), or among anthracene (151–154, Fig. 10), or fused together with anthracene unit (155–165, Fig. 10) to form five-ring-fused building blocks and their derivatives.
 Fig. 8  Organic small molecules of ADT and its derivatives. 
Anthradithiophene (ADT, 085 and 086, Fig. 8) is a symmetrical molecule in which two thiophene rings are fused at both ends of the anthracene unit.146,160,161 Compared to pentacene, ADT has better stability due to the loss of aromaticity and conjugation and better substitutional positions at both ends, improving the material solubility. The optical band gap of ADT is 2.61 eV,160 which is higher than that of pentacene (1.8 eV).162 Vacuum deposited thin films of ADT can achieve a high mobility of 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1.146 However, due to the precursor from a non-regioselective product, the traditional synthesis of ADT gives a mixture of two isomers (anti-ADT, 085, and syn-ADT, 086, Fig. 8) which are difficult to separate from each other. It is also controversial to conclude which kind of molecular modification can obtain better performance. Anthony et al. decorated amide substituents on the ADT unit and used different solvents to grow single crystals of mixtures of anti- and syn-ADT derivatives (anti- and syn-ADTA, 106, Fig. 8).163 Polar solvents can distinguish the anti- and syn-ADT derivatives due to their different dipole moments derived from the bulky substituents. Furthermore, the authors introduced one trialkylsilylethyne solubilizing group at the 6- or 13-position of ADT to increase the molecular dipole moment of the molecules and distinguish three ADT isomers (114–116, Fig. 8).164 However, the three unsymmetrical molecules resulted in lower mobilities of ∼10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1.164 Furthermore, the introduction of extra-long side chains may strongly affect the molecular packing and the intermolecular interactions, and the effect of the isometric core structure may be ignored. Geerts et al. introduced alky groups into ADT and got isomerically pure anti-ADT.165 Other synthesis methods to achieve isomerically pure ADT derivatives were also reported recently.166–168 For the ADT unit itself, a novel synthetic method was used to distinguish the ADT isomers. Anti-ADT (085, Fig. 8) can give a higher mobility of 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1, while syn-ADT (086, Fig. 8) has a lower mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1.161 It is also concluded that the mobility of isomerically pure anti-ADT is several times higher than that of the mixture, and the main explanation for this isomeric difference is that anti-ADT has a more homogeneous morphology on substrate than syn-ADT. Furthermore, anti-ADT has fewer disorders, which may decrease the charge transport trapping density and improve performance. Theoretical calculations based on single-crystal structures indicate that anti-ADT has a lower reorganization energy.160,161 A similar phenomenon is observed in another ADT derivative (anti- and syn-DMADT, 087, Fig. 8), in which the hole mobility of anti-DMADT (0.41 cm2 V−1 s−1) is higher than that of syn-DMADT (0.084 cm2 V−1 s−1).168 The distinguishment of the isomeric molecules is still under investigation since the isomerically pure product usually experiences a long way with a low yield.169
The substitutions at both ends of ADT include alkyl groups (087,160,168090–092,170,171Fig. 8), benzene (088,172Fig. 8), a fluorinated benzene ring (089,160Fig. 8), and β-methylthionation anthradithiophene (β-MT-ADT, 093,173Fig. 8). With an increasing chain length of alkyl groups (DMADT, 087, DHADT, 090, DDADT, 091, DOADT, 092, Fig. 8), thin-film field-effect transistors show a mobility order of DMADT (0.41 cm2 V−1 s−1) > DHADT (0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1) > DDADT (0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1) > DOADT (0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1).168,170,171 Vacuum-deposited thin films of DPh-ADT (088, Fig. 8) have a hole mobility of 1.3 cm2 V−1 s−1,172 while the introduction of a fluorinated benzene ring for ADT (089,160Fig. 8) can generate an ambipolar performance with a hole mobility of 4.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.160 It should be noted that β-methylthionation of acenedithiophene can change the molecular packing from the edge-to-face interactions to the face-to-face and end-to-face packing. As a result, the hole mobility of β-MT-ADT single crystals (093, Fig. 8) can be as high as 4.08 cm2 V−1 s−1.173 This indicates that the modulation of intermolecular interaction via molecular design can improve the performance of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors.
Three soluble tetrabutylanthradithiophenes (TE-TBADT, TTE-TBADT, PE-TBADT, 094–096, Fig. 8) were synthesized to improve the solubility of ADT.174 However, the three compounds can only obtain lower mobilities of 10−4–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compared with soluble tetrabutylanthradithiophenes, TMS (098, Fig. 8), TES (099–106, Fig. 8), TIPS (107–110, Fig. 8) and other side chains (111–113, Fig. 8) are popular side chains decorated at the C-6/C-13 positions of ADT to balance between the mobility and the solubility.175 In these molecular systems, TES-ADT (099,175–204Fig. 8) and diF-TES-ADT (100,166,169,179,201,205–251Fig. 8) are widely investigated. Both TES-ADT and diF-TES-ADT are hole transport materials with excellent solution processability. For TES-ADT, many solution process technologies including spread,175 lamination,177 spin coating,176,178,179,181,183–185,187–190,193,195–200 dip coating,191 drop casting,180,182,186,194 solvent-assisted crystallization192,201 and vibration-assisted crystallization201 can be used to get high quality crystallized thin films with excellent transport behavior. Many results reveal that the mobility of TES-ADT can be larger than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the highest value of 3.08 cm2 V−1 s−1 is achieved for TES-ADT thin films obtained via the spin coating method.197 Similar to TES-ADT, in addition to the above described solution-processed methods, thin films of diF-TES-ADT can be fabricated by direct spraying213,230,238 and inkjet printing221,227,231,243 methods. High-quality single crystals of diF-TES-ADT can be obtained by physical vapor transport.166,207,210 As shown in Fig. 9, diF-TES-ADT single crystals are standing on the substrate with a layer-by-layer structure. The molecule displays a 2D “bricklayer” packing with a distance between two adjacent π-stack planes of ∼3.4 Å. A high mobility of 6 cm2 V−1 s−1 is observed along the direction of close π-stack planes.207

The mobility of diF-TES-ADT was measured to be 8 cm2 V−1 s−1via spin coating technology.242 Recently, water-surface drag coating was used to fabricate high-quality diF-TES-ADT thin films with a recorded mobility value of 16.1 cm2 V−1 s−1.251 In addition to the side chains of TES and TIPS, other groups at the R2- and R3-positions of ADT (101–110, Fig. 8) result in decreased mobilities.163,166,175,179,180,201,212,252
Compared to linear conjugation, the molecular design for 2D conjugation has recently been paid intensive attention because the 2D molecular packing may enhance the π–π interaction and favor the charge transport.253 For example, four thiophene rings were fused at the ends of anthracene to form an X-shaped molecule (117–127, Fig. 8).254–257 The S⋯S interaction together with π–π stacking is believed to enhance the intermolecular charge transport. However, the best mobility of these series of compounds was 0.074 cm2 V−1 s−1 (118, Fig. 8), in which four hexyl groups adorned at the α-positions of the thiophene rings.254–256,258 Müllen et al. synthesized thiophene-annelated coronenes (149–151, Fig. 8) with enhanced intermolecular interactions and good assembly properties. However, the hole mobility order for compounds 149–151 is 149 (2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) > 150 (1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) > 151 (N.A.).259 This is mainly attributed to the feature of their self-assembly into 1D columnar stacks with the depression of the charge transport channel. It was also found that the low crystalline thin films originated from the larger fused π-conjugated plane.
Another synthesis protocol of fusing thiophene rings into anthracene units is to form a nonlinear building block. Chen et al. synthesized ADT and dialkylated ADT (137–147, Fig. 8), which have a slipped cofacial molecular packing. Different numbers of alkyl groups can be connected along the long and short molecular axes, except that diphenyl-substituted ADT shows a traditional herringbone packing.92,260–262 Bis-C12T-a-ADT (143, Fig. 8) and C12T-a-ADT (144, Fig. 8) have hole mobilities of 1.06 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.02 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.263
Picene-type and phenacene-type ADT and their derivatives were synthesized (128–136, Fig. 8) due to their expected deep HOMO, wide band gap and desirable mobility compared to pentacene.264–266 The thin film mobility of picene-type ADT without side-chain substitution (PDT-1, 130, Fig. 8) is ∼0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, and no field-effect performance is observed for the isomer of PDT-1 (PDT-2, 128, Fig. 8).265 Alkyl side-chain engineering of phenacene-type ADT is studied, and C12-PDT (134, Fig. 8) has superior field-effect mobility over others due to the highly crystalline thin films oriented on the substrate.264 The highest hole mobility of 16.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 for this catalog is reported for compound 100.251
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 8 are shown in Table S5 of the ESI.†
The two thiophene rings can not only be fused on both sides of an anthracene unit, but they can also be individually put among three benzene rings (152–155, Fig. 10)87,267–269 or fused together on the one side of an anthracene unit (156–164, Fig. 10)270 or among anthracene units (165 and 166, Fig. 10).271 In the former configurations, both the main building block and the alkyl side chain substitution show lower mobilities of ∼10−3–10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. In the latter asymmetrical structures, the main structure of anthra[2,3-b]thieno[2,3-d]thiophene (ATT) has a mobility of 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the α-selective alkyl substitution of ATT (CnATT, n = 6, 8, 10, 12, 157–160, Fig. 10)270 contributes almost the same performance but with improved solubility compared to ATT. The further alkylthienyl-substituted ATT compounds (CnTATT, n = 6, 8, 10, 12, 161–164, Fig. 10)270 show much higher mobilities up to 1.9 cm2 V−1 s−1 (C8TATT, 162, Fig. 10) because the introduction of middle thiophene makes the molecular packing undergo change, and thin films of CnTATT can be oriented edge-on in an orderly manner on the substrate which contributes better mobilities.270 It should be emphasized that compound 166 (Fig. 10) has high solution solubility and good thermal stability; furthermore, spin-coated thin films can achieve a hole mobility of 2.8 cm2 V−1 s−1, while single-crystalline thin films obtained via the blade-coating technique can obtain a value as high as 6.3 cm2 V−1 s−1.271 This reveals that the suitable modulation of the substitution position for the main asymmetric building block can decrease the cohesive energy and retain the bilayer-type herringbone packing, which can be used as a good clue to design asymmetric semiconductors with good performance and high thermal stability.
 Fig. 10  Organic small molecules based on hybrids between three benzene rings and two thiophene rings. 
Although the two thiophene rings can be put individually at the central position, the isomeric structures still exist, and it is unclear whether the anti-position (152 and 153, Fig. 10)87,267,268 or syn-position (154 and 155, Fig. 10)269 has higher mobility. The results indicate that these molecules have experimental mobility ranges of 10−3–10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1.

3.3 Five-ring-fused molecules based on three thiophene rings and two benzene rings
Three thiophene rings can be fused in the central position with two benzene rings decorated on both sides (167–170, Fig. 11).98,272–277 Or three thiophene rings can be individually fused with two benzene rings (171–183, Fig. 11).100,278–280
 Fig. 11  Organic small molecules with building blocks of hybrids between two benzene rings and three thiophene rings. 
A dense intermolecular packing is observed via the introduction of S⋯S interactions when three thiophene rings are fused together. One typical example, dibenzo[d,d′]thieno[3,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene (DBTDT, 167, Fig. 11), was first discovered in 1938.281 Similar to pentacene, DBTDT has a rigid, linear, and planar structure. The central fused three thiophene rings can be fused with three different positions (with the sulphur atoms of the thiophene rings located in either the same direction or different directions), which cannot be separated by chemical synthesis. In 2007, Hu et al. improved the synthesis of DBTDT with three steps and a high yield in which abundant commercial benzo[b]thiophene can be used as the source material.272 The vacuum deposited thin films of DBTDT were proved to have a hole mobility of 0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1,272 while single crystals showed a much higher mobility of 1.8 cm2 V−1 s−1.273 DBTDT has a remarkable high ionization potential, which can improve the stability of the materials.
DBTDT has another isomeric structure of bis(benzo[4,5]thieno)[2,3-b:3′,2′-d]thiophene (BBTT, 169, Fig. 11).276 DBTDT is a linear symmetrical molecule, while BBTT is more like a sickle due to the enhanced S⋯S interaction in the same direction of three fused thiophene rings. A single crystal of DBTDT shows a herringbone packing, while BBTT prefers to be in π–π stacking mode. The former can form regular hexagonal shapes, and the latter can easily self-assemble into one-dimensional nanowires. Single-crystalline BBTT nanoribbons show a mobility of 0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and improved solution solubility.273
The alkyl side chain of DBTDT can increase the π-orbital overlapping with the adjacent molecules. Vacuum deposited dihexyl-substituted DBTDT (C6-DBTDT, 168, Fig. 11) can form ideal layer-by-layer thin films and the hole mobility can be up to 3.1 cm2 V−1 s−1.274 As shown in Fig. 12, two different phases of C6-DBTDT single crystals can be obtained by the drop cast method: α-phase platelet-like single crystals are obtained from a dense chlorobenzene solution (5.0 mg mL−1), while β-phase ribbon-like single crystals are grown from a dilute chlorobenzene solution (0.3 mg mL−1). The former can achieve a high mobility of 18.9 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the latter can achieve a hole mobility of 8.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, indicating a phase-dependent transport behavior.98 It is worth stating that the above-reported mobility of α-phase single crystal C6-DBTDT represents the highest value of p-type five-ring-fused organic semiconductors.

Three thiophene rings individually fused with two benzene rings still exist at the anti-position (171 and 172,100,278181,282Fig. 11) and syn-position (173,100177,100182,282Fig. 11). Wex et al. synthesized isomerically pure anti- and syn-TBBT via Bradsher cyclization.283–285 Yasuda et al. analyzed the isomeric effect on the charge transport properties for both unsubstituted and alkyl-substituted TBBT. The results indicated that the better self-assembly ability of the syn-position (syn-TBBT-8, 177, Fig. 11) could contribute much higher mobility than the anti-position (anti-TBBT-8, 172, Fig. 11).100 It is contrary to the report of anti- and syn-ADT.161 Single crystals of syn-TBBT-8 obtained by drop casting can achieve a remarkable value of 10.1 cm2 V−1 s−1.100 However, it is still hard to conclude which configuration (anti-/syn-) is a better candidate for organic electronics. Thieno[3,2-f:4,5-f′]bis[1]benzothiophene (TBBT-V) compounds with decyl (C10-TBBT-V, 178, Fig. 11) and decylthienyl substituents (α-C10-Th-TBBT-V and β-C10-Th-TBBT-V, 179 and 180, Fig. 11) appear to have a V-shape and herringbone packing.279 Single crystalline films of C10-TBBT-V have a hole mobility of 6.2 cm2 V−1 s−1.279 The different displacement of decyl substituents at the thiophene ring can make a big difference for C10-Th-TBBT-V. The α-position displacement of TBBT (α-C10-Th-TBBT-V, 179, Fig. 11) can lead to a decreased value of 0.55 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the β-position decoration (β-C10-Th-TBBT-V, 180, Fig. 11) can result in an increased mobility of 2.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to the enhanced π-conjugated system.279 Recently, Tian et al. reported two 2-hexyl substituted thienoacenes, BTBTT6-anti (181, Fig. 11) and BTBTT6-syn (182, Fig. 11). Their results indicate that the mobility of the syn-isomer (11.7 cm2 V−1 s−1) is higher than that of the anti-isomer (4.9 cm2 V−1 s−1).282 Higashino et al. reported another unsymmetric molecule (Ph-BTBTT-C10, 183, Fig. 11) with a phenyl group and an alkyl group separately located at the end of both sides.280 The drop-cast crystalline films of Ph-BTBTT-C10 can reach a high mobility of 12.8 cm2 V−1 s−1.280
Aiming at understanding the role of anti-/syn- in the charge transport properties of organic semiconductors, we have also summarized one critical review recently.286
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 11 are shown in Table S7 of the ESI.†
3.4 Five-ring-fused molecules based on four thiophene rings and one benzene ring
Four thiophene rings and one benzene ring can be fused together to form a new pentacene analog, dithieno[2,3-d;2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT). Alkyl substituents can be chemically adorned on both sides of DTBDT (184–187, Fig. 13) via two-step reactions.287–292 The optical band gaps of the DTBDT derivatives are around 3.36 eV, which are much higher than that of pentacene (1.77 eV). The dip-coating of linear hexyl chains on DTBDT can result in long-range ordered thin films with a high mobility of 1.7 cm2 V−1 s−1.287
 Fig. 13  Organic molecules of hybrids between one benzene ring and four thiophene rings. 
When alkyl substituents are decorated on the main building unit of DTBDT, the π–π interactions along the aromatic planes of DTBDT derivatives are enhanced to self-assemble into monolayer structures. Large-area stripes of DTBDT-C6 (185, Fig. 13)288,289,291 and DTBDT-C9 (186, Fig. 13)292 can be obtained. As shown in Fig. 14, monolayer and bilayer microstripes of DTBDT-C9 can be obtained via a simple dip-coating process, in which the substrate with target materials can be vertically lifted from the solution. The hole mobility of crystalline thin films of DTBDT-C9 can be ∼0.19 cm2 V−1 s−1,292 while DTBDT-C6 can achieve a hole mobility of 1.7 cm2 V−1 s−1.287

The phenyl, styryl, and thieno-annulation side chains can also be introduced into DTBDT (188–190, Fig. 13),293 and the π–π conjugations are elongated to get a mobility range of 0.04–0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1.293
Using dicyanomethylene-substituted quinoidal dithieno[2,3-d;2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophenes (QDTBDTs) with alkyl chains engineered on both sides (191–193, Fig. 13)294 is another attempt to improve the π conjugation length as well as lower the LUMO energy. By changing the distance and the branching position of alkyl chains, the charge transport properties can be tuned from electron transport to ambipolar behavior. QDTBDT-2C (191, Fig. 13) with short linear alkyl chains and longer branching alkyl chains showed a pure n-type mobility of 0.57 cm2 V−1 s−1, and QDTBDT-3C (192, Fig. 13) with enhanced linear alkyl chains and shorter branching alkyl chains displayed ambipolar behavior with electron dominated transport (0.22 cm2 V−1 s−1), while QDTBDT-4C (193, Fig. 13) with longer linear chains and shorter branching alkyl chains had ambipolar transport with both lower hole (1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron (0.17 cm2 V−1 s−1) transport.294
Compared to the linear rigid fused five-ring core of DTBDT, angular-shaped five-ring-fused analogs can be easily solution-processed. Benzodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (BDTT) compounds with alkoxy-side chains adorned into the middle benzene ring are the typical examples (194–199, Fig. 13).295 Vacuum deposited thin films of BDTT-4 can reach a hole mobility of 2.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and longer alkoxy-side chains of BDTT have mobilities of 0.59 cm2 V−1 s−1 (BDTT-6, 195, Fig. 13), 0.85 cm2 V−1 s−1 (BDTT-8, 196, Fig. 13), and 0.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 (BDTT-10, 197, Fig. 13).295 Thin films of NDTT-8 (198, Fig. 13) and NDTT-10 (199, Fig. 13) have a mobility value of ∼0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 with better stability to water and aqueous environments.296 The main reason is that the hydrophobic surfaces of the NDTT-8 or NDTT-10 thin films make it difficult for water molecules to diffuse into the interface between organic semiconductors and insulators. This also provides us with an important clue to design stable organic semiconductors via the formation of hydrophobic structures.
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 13 are shown in Table S8 of the ESI.†
3.5 Pentathienoacene and its derivatives
Dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]thieno[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (pentathienoacene, PTA, 200, Fig. 15) is a novel linearly condensed five-ring-fused organic semiconductor in which five fused thiophene rings replace five fused benzene rings. Although the synthesis of PTA is quite complicated,297,298 the theoretical calculation results indicate that PTA has a larger band gap and exhibits desirable performance since fused thiophenes have favorable conjugation and S⋯S interactions.80,83,299,300 Thin films of PTA are proved to be a p-type semiconductor with a measured field-effect mobility of 0.045 cm2 V−1 s−1.297
 Fig. 15  Organic molecules of PTA and its derivatives. 
The oxidation of PTA (201, Fig. 15) happens at the S position of the second thiophene ring, in which S,S-dioxide modifies the molecular structure and charge transport properties. The calculated electron mobility based on the oxidized PTA can reach ∼0.63 cm2 V−1 s−1.301 The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 15 are shown in Table S9 of the ESI.†
3.6 Polymers based on a five-ring-fused building block between thiophene and benzene
One strategy for improving the solubility of five fused-ring molecules is to engineer the side chains, and another effective one is polymerization. The five-ring-fused building block is incorporated into the conjugated polymer to lower the band gap and maintain good π–π interactions. The main units of the polymerization based on hybridization between thiophene and benzene rings include ADT (202–212, Fig. 16),302–305 DTBDT (213–219, Fig. 16),306–309 and PTA (220, Fig. 16).310
 Fig. 16  Polymers with five-ring-fused building blocks of hybrids between the benzene and thiophene rings. 
The polymerization of ADT can be at either 2,8-positions (202–205, Fig. 16)302,303,311 or 5,11-positions (212, Fig. 16).305 The 2,8-position polymerization can be precisely functionalized by incorporating different comonomers, and the electronic structures can be chemically tuned. Bao et al. developed a conjugated copolymer311 based on the unit of ADT-fluorene via a Suzuki cross-coupling polymerization and applied it in a photovoltaic cell with a power efficiency of up to 0.68%.312 They further synthesized an ADT-cyclopentadithiophene copolymer with an improved efficiency of 1%.302 However, this 2,8-position polymerization of ADT cannot give a highly crystalline thin film due to the existence of disorders made from the mixture of anti- and syn-thiophenes at both ends. The mobilities of the linear ADT backbone are maintained to be ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.302 To avoid the uncertain molecular configurations on the substrate, the linear ADT backbone can be replaced with angular ADT to remove the isomeric influence and improve the molecular order. The higher mobility of 0.079 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be obtained by spin coating thin films of PaADTT (207, Fig. 16).303
5,11-Position polymerization of ADT (212, Fig. 16) can form the backbone with an “orthogonal” configuration, which can further improve the orientation on the substrate and result in a close packing with a hole mobility of 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1.305
The α-position polymerization of DTBDT with β-position soluble substituents can be achieved by an intramolecular electrophilic coupling reaction. This synthesis allows forming donor–acceptor copolymers by introducing different electron-deficient comonomers and gives a lower HOMO level and higher stability. Also, large fused-thiophene rings with β alkyl-substitution were incorporated into the polymer to improve the stability, solubility, and processability. However, the loose packing of the polymer (220, Fig. 16) can only achieve a low mobility of 2.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.310
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 16 are shown in Table S10 of the ESI.†
In summary, thiophene can be regarded as a good substitute to replace one, two, three, four, and five benzene rings of pentacene and construct novel five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. Based on the reported literature, some points can be summarized as follows. (1) More than 150 organic small molecules and polymers are discovered, and many of them can achieve high mobilities of larger than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Side chains of alkyl groups, halogen groups, etc., can be introduced into the building block to realize high-performance organic semiconductors with high stability and low fabrication cost. A hole mobility of 18.9 cm2 V−1 s−1 is reported in α-phase C6-DBTDT single crystals, revealing their promising application in organic electronics. (2) All measured five-ring-fused organic semiconductors based on the hybrid between thiophene and benzene show p-type transport behavior. Ambipolar or even n-type transport is expected in the molecular design of this catalogue.
(3) Isomeric structures may exist when two or more thiophene rings are introduced into five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. Although some reported methods, including precise design of chemical synthesis and single crystal growth via the solution method, can distinguish some anti-/syn-isomers, efforts are still needed to adopt simple ways to differentiate and purify the anti-/syn-isomers, and the structure–property study of charge transport between anti- and syn-isomers is also expected. (4) With the introduction of thiophene rings, the material stability of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors is better than that of pentacene. (5) Some five-ring-fused organic semiconductors such as TES-ADT and diF-TES-ADT can be solution-processed with good charge transport mobilities. (6) It is still unclear whether symmetrical or unsymmetrical molecules can achieve high mobilities. The traditional concepts had believed that symmetrical molecules can achieve high performance until the recently reported Ph-BTBTT-C10 molecule achieved an unbelievable value of 12.8 cm2 V−1 s−1.
4. Hybrids between acenes and furans
The molecular size of the oxygen element is smaller than that of sulfur, which may induce dense molecular packing. When the central thiophene ring is replaced with the furan ring, the linear rigid structure of DNT will be changed to oxygen-bridged V-shaped dinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-d]furan (DNF-V, 221, Fig. 17) due to the intermolecular interaction of the herringbone packing.313 DNF-V has a bent structure rather than a traditional planar structure with a slightly twisted angle between the two naphthalene rings. A high mobility of 1.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be obtained from single-crystal DNF-V.314 Decyl group substitution can be decorated at both ends of the benzene ring, and the mobilities of both C10-DNF-VW (222, Fig. 17) and C10-DNF-VV (223, Fig. 17) are greater than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1.315
 Fig. 17  Organic small molecules of hybrids between acenes and furans. 
Molecular design can be based on the picene backbone, and the first synthesis of dinaphtho[1,2-b:2′,1′-d]furan (DNF-W, 224, Fig. 17) was reported in 1982, which is from the direct thermal cyclization of 2,2′-binaphthalene-1,1′-diol.316 Takeya et al. used a commercial material of α-naphthol as the source material and got DNF-W crystals by directly heating it in a sealed tube.158 As shown in Fig. 18, a single-crystalline column of DNF-W can be obtained by physical vapor transport, and it has a planar configuration with a hole mobility of 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1, while similar molecules of DNT-W (083, Fig. 6) and DNS-W (232, Fig. 19) represent planar crystals with herringbone packing and show improved values of 1.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.0 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.158 Another oxygen-bridged picene analogue is dinaphtho[2,1-b:1′,2′-d]furan (DNF-U, 225, Fig. 17),317,318 in which the fused position of the benzene ring is changed, and the V-shape is bent to a U-shape. Although the outer two benzene rings have a torsion angle of ∼23° and the molecular structure of DNF-U has a wide twisted configuration, the π–π conjugation of DNF-U has not been affected. Actually, the highest hole mobility (1 cm2 V−1 s−1) of single crystal DNF-U is proved to be parallel to the π–π stacking direction.318

 Fig. 19  Organic small molecules of hybrids between acenes and selenophenes. 
Furan rings can be fused with benzene rings by intramolecular O-arylation reaction.319,320 But this reaction still may induce isomeric mixtures. Takimiya et al. synthesized anthra[2,3-b:6,7-b′]-difuran (anti-ADF, 226, Fig. 17). However, thin films of anti-ADF cannot be thermally evaporated due to their low sublimation point.172 2,8-Position substituents with phenyl groups can give 2,8-diphenylanthra[2,3-b:6,7-b′]difuran (DPh-ADF, 227, Fig. 17) with a mobility of 0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1.172
Similar to TES-pentacene and TIPS-pentacene, the TES- and TIPS-side chains can be added to the ADF backbone. Platelet-like crystals of TES-ADF (228, Fig. 17) have a mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1, while needle-like dark orange-red crystals of TIPS-ADF (229, Fig. 17) have a mobility of 0.021 cm2 V−1 s−1.321
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 17 are shown in Table S11 of the ESI.†
5. Hybrids between acenes and selenophenes
The efficient synthesis of aromatic rings, especially for five-ring-fused semiconductors with highly extended heteroarenes, is still a challenge since it normally involves long synthesis steps and low yields. Takimiya et al. developed a selenophene–benzene peri-fused aromatic (236, Fig. 19) using Bergman cycloaromatization, and this π-extended heteroarene can achieve a low mobility of ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.267 They further synthesized anthra[2,3-b:6,7-b′]-diselenophene (anti-ADS, 234, Fig. 19) and the 2,8-position phenyl-substituent of anti-ADS (DPh-ADS, 235, Fig. 19).172 Thermally evaporated thin films of anti-ADS can achieve an improved mobility of up to 0.75 cm2 V−1 s−1, while DPh-ADS has a similar value of 0.53 cm2 V−1 s−1.172
It is worth noticing that using a selenophene-based picene analog can be a successful attempt to achieve high performance. Single crystalline ribbons of dinaphtho[1,2-b:2′,1′-d]selenophene (DNS-W, 232, Fig. 19) have a pentacene-like herringbone packing with head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations.158 Although the calculation based on DNS-W crystal reveals that there is a bent structure due to the introduction of selenophene, large orbital coefficients observed on the chalcogen atoms of DNS-W can contribute a higher single-crystalline mobility of ∼2.0 cm2 V−1 s−1.158 Furthermore, single crystals of dialkylated DNS-W (232, Fig. 19) can be directly drop-cast on a substrate with a high mobility of 4.5 cm2 V−1 s−1.159
Recently, Okamoto et al. first synthesized two polymorphs of a selenium-bridged V-shaped five-ring-fused semiconductor (C10-DNS-VW, 230, Fig. 19), depending on the selection of crystal growth methods. The solution process can give a colorless phase of polycrystalline thin films with 1D p-stacked molecular packing, while the vacuum deposition process will result in a yellow phase of polycrystalline thin films with a 2D herringbone packing motif. The former exhibits a hole mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the latter shows a high value of 11 cm2 V−1 s−1, which reveals the importance of modulating the molecular packing and intermolecular interactions towards high mobility five-ring-fused organic semiconductors.322
Three selenophenes can be fused in the central position with two phenyl groups located on both sides to form a U shaped molecule (238, Fig. 19).323 The U shaped configuration can form bilayer lamellar assemblies with a head-to-head packing, and thin-film field-effect transistors were made to achieve a hole mobility of 0.058 cm2 V−1 s−1.323 Furthermore, the alternate incorporation of thiophene, selenophene, and tellurophene (503–505, Fig. 42) can affect the molecular geometries, electronic structures, and non-covalent intermolecular interactions. Consequently, high mobilities of up to 3.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 (503, Fig. 42) can be obtained.323
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 19 are shown in Table S12 of the ESI.†
6. Hybrids between acenes and tellurophenes
The challenge of the introduction of tellurophene is the selection of tellurophene precursors. There is one example of a hybrid between an acene and a tellurophene, in which the central benzene ring of 3,10-dialkylpicene analogs is replaced with a tellurophene ring. Dialkylated dinaphtho[1,2-b:2′,1′-d]chalcogenophenes (239, Fig. 20) has a narrower band gap with a high mobility of 1.8 cm2 V−1 s−1.159 Their results indicate that, by changing the central rings of thiophene to selenophene and tellurophene, the HOMO levels of the three five-ring-fused organic semiconductors are gradually increased, which means that the stabilities of the materials are gradually decreased. Furthermore, the ionization potentials (IPs) of the three five-ring-fused organic semiconductors are decreased too.
 Fig. 20  Organic small molecules of hybrids between acenes and tellurophenes. 
The incorporation of tellurophene and thiophene into a five-ring-fused organic small molecule has recently been reported to result in a high thin-film mobility of 3.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 (505, Fig. 42).323
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 20 are shown in Table S13 of the ESI.†
7. Hybrids between acenes and pyrroles
A pyrrole ring can be fused with two benzene rings to form a carbazole, which is an important precursor for the further synthesis of dyes and optoelectronics applications. Also, the pyrrole ring can be fused on both sides of anthracene. Small molecules and polymers based on hybrids between acenes and pyrroles can be described as follows.
7.1 Indolocarbazole (ICZ) and its derivatives
Indolocarbazole is a five-ring-fused organic semiconductor based on the hybrid between carbazole and indole and has been paid intensive attention since it is a basic synthetic unit for the further synthesis of molecules for application in optoelectronic devices,324 drug delivery, tumor promoters, anion recognition, bifunctional modulators,325etc.326
In 1963, Robins developed the first synthesis method of indolocarbazoles by a Fischer indolization of cyclohexane-l,2-dione bisphenylhydrazone. Indolocarbazoles can be synthesized in a few simple ways with high yields.327–331 An indole unit can be either para-fused or meta-fused into a carbazole unit. The former is a linear rigid five-ring-fused organic semiconductor with two isomeric structures: 5,11-dihydroindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (5,11-ICZ, 240, Fig. 21)328,329,332,333 and 5,7-dihydroindolo[2,3-b]carbazole (5,7-ICZ, 241, Fig. 21).333 The latter has two non-linear isomeric molecular structures: 5,12-dihydroindolo[3,2-a]carbazole (5,12-ICZ, 242, Fig. 21)333 and 11,12-dihydroindolo[2,3-a]carbazole (11,12-ICZ, 243, Fig. 21).333 As shown in Fig. 22, 5,11-ICZ, 5,7-ICZ, 5,12-ICZ, and 11,12-ICZ are four isomeric structures with similar molecular packings. However, it is hard to predict which configuration results in better mobility. Jiang et al. studied the structure–property relationship by both experimental and theoretical methods.333 Single-crystal field-effect transistors showed mobility order of 5,7-ICZ (3.61 cm2 V−1 s−1) > 5,11-ICZ (0.55 cm2 V−1 s−1) > 5,12-ICZ (∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and 11,12-ICZ (∼10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). The theoretical analysis indicates that the higher mobility of 5,7-ICZ is mainly attributed to the higher hole transfer integral that is linked to stronger intermolecular interaction in the presence of multiple NH⋯π and CH⋯π(py) interactions, in combination with overall lower hole–phonon coupling in the absence of coupling of holes due to low-frequency modes due to better π conjugation.333

5,11-ICZ is insoluble in common organic solvents and may decompose when sublimed. The side-chain engineering of ICZ is one solution to improve the processability of ICZ. In 2004, Leclerc et al. used a soluble N-alkyl substituted carbazole precursor to synthesize 5,11-dioctyl-6,12-dimethylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (263, Fig. 21). The π conjugation of compound 263 (Fig. 21) is extended due to the introduction of alkyl substitution at the R1 and R2 positions, and the thin-film mobility is ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off ratio of 105.334 Incorporating alkyl chains at the R1 and R3 positions (254, Fig. 21) gives a mobility range of 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.332 Ong et al. introduced long linear alkyl chains (257, Fig. 21) and alkyl chains with side phenyl chains (271, Fig. 21) at the R1 position to improve material processability.335
Compound 271 (Fig. 21) has a better mobility of 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1, while compounds 256 and 257 (Fig. 21) have lower mobilities of 10−5–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.335 Based on the N5- and N11-position side-chain engineering, the authors further decorated halogen atoms at the R3 and R4 positions to stabilise the injected hole carriers (267–270, Fig. 21).336 The thermally evaporated thin films of compounds 266–268 (Fig. 21) have better ordered molecular configurations on the substrate, and compound 268 (Fig. 21) has a higher mobility of 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1, while compounds 266 and 267 (Fig. 21) have a mixture of two phases which induce disorders and lower mobility (10−4–0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1).336
Hu et al. synthesized chloro-substituted ICZ derivatives, 2,8-dichloro-indolo[3,2-b]carbazole (CICZ, 247, Fig. 21)337 and indolo[3,2-b]carbazole,2,8-dichloro-5,11-dihexylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (CHICZ, 255, Fig. 21).337,338 CICZ does not have field-effect mobility, while a single crystal of CHICZ has a high mobility of 0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The big difference between CICZ and CHICZ is molecular packing. CICZ has a herringbone packing, and CHICZ shows one-dimensional π–π stacking.337
Other substituents at the nitrogen atom of ICZ include oxymethyl- (252, Fig. 21),87 phenyl- (272–274, Fig. 21),339 fluorenyl- (275, 277, Fig. 21) and carbazolyl- (276, Fig. 21) groups.339 The theoretical calculation of compound 252 (Fig. 21) reveals that it has a high mobility of 1.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 87 and the measured mobility of compound 276 (Fig. 21) is ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1via time-of-flight measurement.339
The lengths of alkyl chains and the lateral chains at the N5- and N11-positions of ICZ play an important role in tuning its molecular packing and electronic properties. Leclerc et al. discussed the functions of R1, R3, and R4 in ICZ for application in organic transistors. At the N5- and N11-positions of ICZ, not only the alkyl side chains but also phenyl (HPIND, 265, OPIND, 271, Fig. 21) and thiophene (HTIND, 264, Fig. 21) rings can be introduced in the ICZ backbone.340 Thin films of HPIND and OPIND have mobilities of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.340 The authors further chemically decorated octyl groups at the N5- and N11-positions of ICZ and introduced the phenyl group (3POIND, 259; 2POIND, 262, Fig. 21) or the thiophene group (2TOIND, 260; 3TOIND, 258, Fig. 21) at the R3- and R4-positions. 3POIND has the best performance with a high mobility of 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the other three similar compounds (2POIND, 2TOIND, and 3TPOIND) show mobilities of 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, showing the importance of slight adjustment of molecular side-chain engineering for ICZ derivatives.340 The high mobility of phenyl-substituted ICZ is attributed to the layer-by-layer molecular packing with strong face-to-face and edge-to-edge interactions. The results also indicate that the long axis of ICZ derivatives with N5- and N11-alkyl side chains is parallel to the substrate and their alkyl chains are vertical to the substrate. The authors further added octylthiophene (244, 249, Fig. 21)341 or p-octylbenzene (245, 246, 250, 251, Fig. 21)341 at the 3,9-positions of the ICZ backbone as well as a methyl group or hydrogen is added to the N5- and N11-positions of ICZ, and the best hole mobility of 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 is achieved for 3,9-di(p-octylbenzene)-5,11-dihydroindolocarbazole (245, Fig. 21).341 Compared to the N5- and N11-side-chain engineering, alkyl chain introduction at both ends (3,9-positions) of ICZ can change the molecular packing of thin films on the substrate and charge transport properties. The orientation of thin films is perpendicular to the substrate rather than parallel to the substrate. The hydrogen and methyl group substitutions at N5- and N11-positions have almost the same performance.341
Since the benzene ring with alkyl chains can improve the performance of ICZ derivatives, Liu et al. tried to introduce benzene rings with fluorinated alkyl chains at the R3 position to further modify the electronic structure of ICZ derivatives. They developed the 2,8-di(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-5,11-di-n-octylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (2TFMPOIND, 261, Fig. 21) molecule.342 Due to the F⋯H hydrogen bonds and long alkyl–alkyl close interaction together with the strong cofacial π–π interaction contributed by the ICZ main block, 2TFMPOIND can easily dissolve into an organic solvent to form a one-dimensional nanowire with a mobility of 0.084 cm2 V−1 s−1 and improved air stability.
Two ICZ derivatives of octyl groups decorated with amine groups can connect with each other via alkyl chains (282–285, Fig. 21).343 These molecules have good solubility in organic solvents and form rod-like structures, but the mobility range is maintained to be ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to the distortion of long-chain molecules.343
A new extended π-conjugated system (10,15-dihydro-5H-diindolo[3,2-a:3′,2′-c]carbazole, 272, Fig. 21)339 based on ICZ has been developed, in which three carbazoles share with one benzene ring to form a dense columnar structure.344 The methyl- (279, Fig. 21),344–346 butyl- (280, Fig. 21),347 and hexyl- (281, Fig. 21)346,347 groups can be substituted at the amine group of compound 272 (Fig. 21) with a cofacial molecular packing. This face-to-face molecular packing results in a thin-film mobility of 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1345 and a single-crystal mobility of 0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for compound 279 (Fig. 21).344 Two ICZ derivatives connected by an alkyl group (282–285, Fig. 21) show a mobility range of 10−4–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.343
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 21 are shown in Table S14 of the ESI.†
Similar to 5,11-dihydroindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (5,11-ICZ, 240, Fig. 21), indolo[3,2-b]carbazole exhibits a π–π stacking with a localized p-benzoquinone diimine moiety. With substitution of two (4-silylethynyl)phenyl groups at the 6- and 12-positions of indolo[3,2-b]carbazole, vacuum-deposited thin films of compound 287 (Fig. 23) show n-type semiconducting behavior with an electron mobility of 0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1.348

7.2 Anthracenedicarboximide (ADI) and its derivatives
ICZ and derivatives are hole transport materials. When electron-withdrawing groups are introduced into the main block of π conjugated organic semiconductors, the electron affinity of organic semiconductors can be tuned to achieve n-type behavior as well as good air stability.
Anthracenedicarboximide (ADI) is a typical example that can be synthesized using the Diels–Alder cycloaddition reaction with good yield. Marks et al. revealed that ADI is an n-type semiconductor with a thin-film mobility of 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.349 Side chains of alkyl- (289, 290, 293, 295, Fig. 24),350 halogenated alkyl- (288, 292, 294, Fig. 24),349 and phenyl- (291, Fig. 24)349 groups can be introduced into the nitrogen atom located on both sides of ADI.350 Also, cyano- and bromo-groups can be decorated at the central benzene ring of ICZ.349 All ADI derivatives are n-type semiconductors, and the highest mobility of 0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1 is from ADIF-CN2 (294, Fig. 24),349 and most ADI derivatives show ∼10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Also, Ren et al. designed some ADI analogs (296–299, Fig. 24) for the application of n-type organic semiconductors, in which molecular stability, reaction activity, and geometries are considered at the molecular level to obtain better candidates, although there are no experimental results for those ADI analogs.351

Perepichka et al. reported a five-ring-fused organic semiconductor with three fused pyrrole units, diindole[3,2-b:4,5-b]pyrrole (300, Fig. 25). A low hole mobility of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was reported. The main reasons for the low performance are the edge-to-face packing and poor π-orbital overlap resulting from the self-complementary H-bonding interactions.352

7.3 Poly(indolocarbazole)s
ICZ is a good backbone for an organic semiconductor with a lower HOMO level and a large band gap, but its solvent solubility is not good for application. The side chain decoration of ICZ yields a low mobility. To control the molecular ordering as well as improve the solubility processability, polymerization based on ICZ building blocks is an ideal method to get stable, solution-processed organic semiconductors.353 The 2,8- (301–304, Fig. 26)137,353,354 and 3,9-positions (305–308, Fig. 26)353,354 of ICZ allow the functional synthesis of homopolymers or copolymers. Upon spin coating, poly(indolocarbazole) thin films show p-type behavior with a low mobility range of 10−3–10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the best performance is from compound 305 (Fig. 26) with a hole mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1,354 in which both nitrogen groups have side chains of N-dodecyl groups.

The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 26 are shown in Table S18 of the ESI.†
In summary, pyrrole can be introduced into the five-ring-fused building block to construct novel organic semiconductors. Some points can be summarized as follows. (1) Both p-type and n-type organic semiconductors can be obtained with the introduction of pyrrole rings. The highest hole mobility of 3.61 cm2 V−1 s−1 is reported for 5,7-ICZ (241, Fig. 21), while the best n-type semiconductor is ADIF-CN2 (294, Fig. 24) with an electron mobility of 0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1. (2) The introduction of more than one pyrrole ring may induce anti-/syn-isomers, and some of them can be distinguished by designing rational synthesis routes, selecting suitable source materials, and growing single crystals via the physical vapor transport method. (3) ICZ and its derivatives show potential application in various fields.
Future research can be focused on the design and fabrication of multifunctional materials. For example, optoelectronic devices based on ICZ derivatives can be explored for application in bioelectronics.
8. Hybrids between acenes and nitrogen-substituted benzenes (N-heteropentacenes)
It is known that complementary circuits need both p-type and n-type organic semiconductors. Different from inorganic semiconductors, most organic semiconductors show p-type charge transport behavior. It is necessary to design and fabricate n-type organic semiconductors. In the case of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors, many synthetic methods have been used to realize the transformation of pentacene derivatives from p-type to n-type or ambipolar charge transport type: (1) keeping the pentacene backbone constant and introducing electron-withdrawing groups, such as halogen (F–, Cl–, Br–) and cyano (CN–) groups, as the substituents of pentacene. A typical example is perfluoropentacene, which shows a planar molecular packing and a high electron mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1.355 In this method, the number of introduced electronegative groups depends on the substitution positions on the pentacene backbone. (2) The introduction of nitrogen- or oxygen-atoms into the pentacene backbone and side chains. The replacement numbers and positions, from carbon to nitrogen in pentacene, can generate a lot of possibilities to lower both the HOMO and LUMO levels of pentacene, and the electronic structures and charge transport properties will be tuned.356 In the following few sections, nitrogen-substituted pentacene will be introduced as well as its charge transport properties will be discussed.
When some carbon atoms of pentacene were replaced with nitrogen atoms, many compounds have been experimentally proved to show less negative reductive potentials and higher electron affinity. Besides, air stability can also be improved. Furthermore, the introduction of nitrogen atoms can form the C–H⋯N intermolecular interaction, which results in a cofacial molecular packing by replacing the herringbone packing of pentacene.
Four synthetic methods are considered for the purpose of tuning the electronic structure and properties of N-heteropentacenes: (1) the positions of pyridines and pyrazines in N-heteropentacenes,357 (2) the number of pyridines and pyrazines in N-heteropentacenes, (3) the introduction of side chains at the nitrogen atom of pyridines, and (4) the side-chain engineering of benzene rings in N-heteropentacenes. The designed strategies can include one of the above-described aspects or a combination of two or three.
Since a few review papers have focused on the synthetic methods of N-heteropentacene derivatives, in the following two sections, we will emphasize the structure–property relationships of some typical N-heteropentacenes.
8.1 Five-ring-fused organic molecules based on hybrids between acenes and pyridines
The replacement of nitrogen atoms in acenes can be traced to 1901, when Hinsbery first synthesized some nitrogen-based ring systems.358
Some recent reports revealed that the positions, numbers, and valence states of nitrogen atoms inserted into the pentacene backbone could change the electronic structures (HOMO/LUMO),359–361 crystal structures and molecular packing, charge transport properties,86,89 material stabilities,85,106etc.
One pyridine ring can be fused at the end of the tetracene building block, and the central benzene ring can be decorated with TIPS side chains to improve the solubility (6,13-bis-(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-1-azapentacene, 309, Fig. 27), which was first synthesized by Zhang et al.362 Compound 309 (Fig. 27) is still a p-type semiconductor with a hole mobility of 0.22 cm2 V−1 s−1.362 When the left benzene ring of compound 309 (Fig. 27) was decorated with four halogen (F–, Cl–) atoms, a balanced ambipolar behavior was experimentally observed in 8,9,10,11-tetrafluoro-6,13-bis-(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-1-azapentacene (310, Fig. 27)362 and 8,9,10,11-tetrachloro-6,13-bis-(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-1-azapentacene (4Cl-Azapen, 311, Fig. 27).363 The former has hole and electron mobilities of 0.08 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.09 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.362 The latter has higher hole and electron mobilities of 0.23 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.21 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.363
 Fig. 27  Organic small molecules based on hybrids between acenes and pyridines. 
Compared to one pyridine ring, two pyridine rings can also be fused at both ends of the anthracene unit to increase the symmetry of the molecular structure. Zhang et al. synthesized 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)anthradipyridine (TIPS-DAP-1t, 312, Fig. 27) via two steps, although the isomeric systems exist due to the different positions of nitrogen atoms. TIPS-DAP-1t has hole and electron mobilities of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.362 A comparative study involving six N-heteropentacenes revealed that the experimentally observed ambipolar transport properties are strongly correlated with their frontier molecular orbital energy levels, suggesting a charge injection-dominated device performance.364 Meanwhile, based on the molecular packing of TIPS-DAP-1t (312, Fig. 27), Shuai et al. used Marcus electron transfer theory coupled with normal mode analysis to study the nitrogen substitution effect on the charge transport properties. The simulated hole and electron mobilities of TIPS-DAP-1t (312, Fig. 27) can be as high as 0.5766 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.441 cm2 V−1 s−1, indicating the potential of further improvement of its charge transport properties.356
To further increase the material stability, oxygen atoms along with nitrogen atoms can be simultaneously introduced into the pentacene backbone. Two similar analogs were synthesized: 3,10-ditrifluoromethyl-triphenodioxazine (313, Fig. 27) and 2,9-ditrifluoromethyltriphenodioxazine (314, Fig. 27).365 Compounds 313 and 314 (Fig. 27) have much lower HOMO–LUMO levels (313, HOMO: −6.04 eV, LUMO: −3.67 eV; 314, HOMO: −6.06 eV, LUMO: −3.67 eV) than pentacene, and consequently show much better air stabilities. Different from the molecular packing of pentacene, compounds 313 and 314 show mainly face-to-face π–π stacking along the three directions. Highly ordered thin films of compounds 313 and 314 can be obtained during sublimation and give pure n-type mobilities of 0.07 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.365 TIPS-tetracyanotriphenodioxazine (TIPS-TPDO-tetraCN, 315, Fig. 27) shows that introduction of four cyano groups on both sides and TIPS groups at the central benzene rings can result in an electron mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1.366
Quinacridone (QA, 316, Fig. 27)367–370 is a typical red hydrogen-bonded paint and cosmetic pigment widely used in commercial industries.371–373 The NH⋯O intermolecular interaction in QA can make the small molecular pigment closely packed and exhibit high stability similar to that obtained in the polymerization process. However, this strong NH⋯O intermolecular interaction decreases the π–π interaction and induces a color change from pale yellow in solution to red in the solid-state. This soluble precursor can also be applied in organic field-effect transistors but with a different hole mobility range of 10−6–0.22 cm2 V−1 s−1, depending on the conditions used in various research groups.367–370 The advantages of good thermal and electrochemical stability374 and excellent solvent solubility make QA suitable for printing electronics, and ambipolar behavior with hole and electron mobilities of 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 was reported.370
Alkyl groups can be introduced into the QA unit to further tune the electronic structures and properties (317–325, Fig. 27).375,376 The alkyl substitution at the nitrogen atom in QA (317, 318, 320, 322, 324, Fig. 27), no matter how long the alkyl chains are, yields either no field-effect behavior or poor performance due to the missing of NH⋯O intermolecular interaction after substitution. The 2,9-position alkyl substitution of QA (319, 321, 323, 325, Fig. 27) gives a lower hole mobility of 10−4–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.375

8.2 Five-ring-fused organic molecules based on hybrids between acenes and pyrazines
1,4-Dihydropyrazine can replace the second benzene ring (332, Fig. 28),89,356,377 the central benzene ring (326 and 327, Fig. 28),91,378–380 or the fourth benzene ring (330, Fig. 28)378 of pentacene. Nuckolls et al. developed a symmetrical molecule of 6,13-dihydrodiazapentacene (DHDAP, 326, Fig. 28) for application in organic field-effect transistors by using simple condensation reactions between a 1,2-aromatic diamine and a 1,2-aromatic diol.378 DHDAP (326, Fig. 28) exhibits different polymorphisms in organic solvents. DHDAP single crystals obtained from benzophenone show a herringbone packing similar to pentacene. The single crystals can also grow from DMF. The solvent molecule finally intercalates into the DHDAP unit and functions as a bridge between two adjacent DHDAP molecules, in which π–π interaction exists rather than a herringbone packing. The existence of two neighboring DMF molecules can form hydrogen bonds with the N–H of DHDAP, revealing the solubility of DHDAP.378 Thin films of DHDAP can be thermally evaporated and show a hole mobility of 5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1,378 five orders lower than that of pentacene. Miao et al. improved the quality of thin films of DHDAP on an OTS-modified substrate at 100 °C, resulting in a higher mobility of 0.45 cm2 V−1 s−1.379 XRD results revealed that this “12.9 Å phase” contributes to the increased mobility, suggesting phase-dependent mobility.379 The performance showed that central benzene replacement with the pyrazine group could yield higher mobility than substitutions at the other positions.

The hydrogen atoms can be substituted with alkyl groups (328 and 329, Fig. 28), and the alkyl-substituted N-heteropentacenes have face-to-face slipped π–π interaction. However, thin films of compounds 328 and 329 have lower mobilities of 10−5–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.381
The alkyl group (331, Fig. 28),378 halogen group (327, Fig. 28),91,380 and TIPS group (332, Fig. 28)89,356,377 can be decorated as the side chains of DHDAP. It should be stressed that the introduction of four chlorine atoms at the 5-, 7-, 12-, and 14-positions of DHDAP makes it a cofacial π–π packing with high electronic coupling along the π–π stacking direction. A high hole mobility of 1.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was experimentally obtained in thin films of TCDAHP (327, Fig. 28).380
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 28 are shown in Table S20 of the ESI.†
1,4-Dihydropyrazine has eight π electrons that can be fused with benzene rings. In contrast, another similar analogue, pyrazine with six π electrons, can also be fused at the end of a tetracene unit (333, 338, Fig. 29),89,356,357,380 or between one benzene and one anthracene unit (334, 339, Fig. 29),74,89,356,377,382 or between two naphthalene rings (335–337, Fig. 29)74,91,380,383,384 to form five-ring-fused organic small molecules. The theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of the pyrazine ring does not change the planarity of the five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. Instead, the HOMO levels of the N-heteropentacenes are lowered to allow electron injection easily.74 Also, both the experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of pyrazine can change the molecular packing of some N-heteropentacene derivatives from a herringbone packing to a π-conjugated stacking.74
 Fig. 29  Organic small molecules based on hybrids between acenes and one pyrazine ring. 
To study the central substitution effect, especially how 1,4-dihydropyrazine and pyrazine affect the device performance, field-effect transistors based on DHDAP (326, Fig. 28) and 5,7,12,14-tetrachloro-6,13-diazapentacene (DAP,385335, Fig. 29) were fabricated to study the structure–property relationship. As described before, thin films of DHDAP had a good hole mobility of 0.45 cm2 V−1 s−1,379 while DAP thin films had a low mobility of 8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.383 The same tendency has been found in TCDAHP (327, Fig. 28) and TCDAP (337, Fig. 29). As shown in Fig. 30, due to the existence of chlorine and nitrogen atoms, the main packing of TCDAHAP and TCDAP is a 1D “slipped-stack” rather than herringbone packing. A shift π–π stacking with a short π–π distance of 3.45 Å and 3.37 Å is observed in TCDAHP (327, Fig. 28) and TCDAP (337, Fig. 29), respectively. The former has a good hole mobility of 1.4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the latter has a lower hole mobility of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is almost one order lower than that of TCDAHP.380 The existence of hydrogen atoms makes DHDAP (326, Fig. 28) and TCDAHP (327, Fig. 28) act as hydrogen-bond donors (N–H), while DAP and TCDAP act as hydrogen-bond acceptors (N), and the former show p-type transport behavior, while the latter have n-type transport characteristics.380 Ren et al. theoretically proved that the introduction of dihydropyrazine could improve the p-type charge transport, while pyrazine is preferable to provide n-type charge transport. The typical example is compound 332 (Fig. 28) with a calculated hole mobility of 0.71 cm2 V−1 s−1, while compound 339 (Fig. 29) has a calculated electron mobility of 1.24 cm2 V−1 s−1.89 Tao et al. studied single-crystal field-effect transistors of TCDAP and found that this extended planar π system facilitates a high electron mobility of 3.39 cm2 V−1 s−1.384 In addition, based on the structural analysis of TIPS-DAP-2p (339, Fig. 29)74,89,356,377 and TIPS-DAP (358, Fig. 32),74,89,101,377,386–389 Bunz et al. suggested that the introduction of nitrogen atoms would result in an improved stability because the positions of nitrogen atoms in N-heteropentacenes can stabilize the radical anions.390,391

DHDAP (326, Fig. 28) and TCDAHP (327, Fig. 28) have a shifted cofacial π–π stacking arrangement, which can easily self-assemble into ordered one-dimensional needle-like crystalline structures along the direction of π–π interaction, and this cofacial π–π intermolecular interaction will result in higher electronic couplings. By using density functional theory, Lau et al. made a theoretical calculation based on the molecular structures TCDAHP (327, Fig. 28), TCDAP (337, Fig. 29), and TFDAP (336, Fig. 29) and found that the charge transport channels of these similar molecules are parallel routes between two adjacent molecules with π–π interactions.91
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 29 are shown in Table S21 of the ESI.†
1,2-Dihydropyrazine is another nitrogen-contained pyrazine group. It can also be introduced into the pentacene unit to provide more substitution positions for further side-chain engineering (340–343, Fig. 31).392,393 Alkyl groups can be chemically decorated at either the nitrogen atom at the central pyrazine or carbon atom at both ends of benzene. Thin films of compounds 340–342 (Fig. 31), prepared by Liu et al., are typical in the amorphous state with the highest hole mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1.392 A single crystal of compound 343 (Fig. 31), made by Miao et al., still showed a low mobility of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.393
 Fig. 31  Organic small molecules based on hybrids between acenes, 1,4-dihydropyrazine and pyrazine. 
Quinone is a well-known organic oxidant and electron acceptor. A typical example is 6,13-pentacenequinone, which is a pentacene precursor and shows insulating properties.65 When one benzene ring of 6,13-pentacenequinone was replaced with pyrazine, the LUMO of 6,13-pentacenequinone was further lowered, and electron transport was observed in 5,14-diaza-6,13-pentacenequinone (334, Fig. 29) with a mobility of 2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.382 Furthermore, one quinone and two pyrazine rings can be inserted into an N-heteropentacene to form symmetrical molecules of 1,4,8,11-tetraaza-6,13-pentacenequinone (355, Fig. 32)74,382 and 5,7,12,14-tetraaza-6,13-pentacenequinone (TAPQ, 356, Fig. 32).74,382,394 TAPQ shows strong π–π interaction in crystal with a planar distance of 3.32 Å along the π-conjugated direction; also, hydrogen bonds of CH⋯N/O found in TAPQ are located between the adjacent molecules. Charge transfer characterization indicated that TAPQ is an n-type semiconductor with a mobility of 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1.394
 Fig. 32  Organic small molecules based on hybrids between acenes and two pyrazine rings. 
Both 1,4-dihydropyrazine and pyrazine can be introduced into the pentacene unit in different combinations (344–353, Fig. 31).89,356,377,393,395,396 On one hand, 1,4-dihydropyrazine and pyrazine can be individually fused at both ends of the anthracene unit (350, Fig. 31)377 or inserted in the middle rings (344 and 345,393Fig. 31). On the other hand, 1,4-dihydropyrazine can be fused with pyrazine first and then combined with the anthracene unit (351, Fig. 31) as well as different side chains were introduced into the different benzene rings of N-heteropentacenes (351–353, Fig. 31)396 or between benzene and naphthalene (346–348, Fig. 31).395
In the molecular structure of dihydrotetraazapentacene (351, Fig. 31),89,356,357 adjacent pyrazine and dihydropyrazine rings are fused together, which allows self-complementary NH⋯NH bond formation. This nitrogen bond can improve the material solubility, and compound 351 (Fig. 31) can dissolve into DMSO and dimethylformamide (DMF) even without a side chain. While the triisopropylsilyl group is substituted, compounds 352 and 353 can dissolve into most organic solvents. Both compounds 351 (Fig. 31) and 353 (Fig. 31) are p-type semiconductors, and compound 353 has a high mobility of 0.7 cm2 V−1 s−1.396
Bunz et al. developed three DHDAP derivatives: N,N′-dihydrotetraazapentacenes (DHTA-H2, DHTA-F2, and DHTA-Cl2, 346–348, Fig. 31).395 The DHTA analogs can form different phases when different methods are used to fabricate thin films. Although the molecular structures of the three DHTA derivatives are different from each other, the orientations of thin films on the substrate are very similar, indicating similar ordering and packing in the thin films. DHTA derivatives are p-type semiconductors, and DHTA-Cl2 (348, Fig. 31) has the highest mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1.395
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 31 are shown in Table S22 of the ESI.†
Miao et al. discussed the effect of the nitrogen position of N-heteropentacenes on the charge transport properties. The results suggested that two pyrazines fused at both ends of the anthracene unit (357, Fig. 32)357 can give a different transport behavior when measured in different environments and showed a hole mobility of 0.22 cm2 V−1 s−1 in air, while an electron mobility of 1.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 was observed under vacuum.357 The authors then inserted pyrazines into the central rings to produce 6,13-bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)-5,7,12,14-tetraazapentacene (TIPS-TAP, 358, Fig. 32),89,377,386–388,397,398 which exhibited pure electron transport with a higher mobility of 3.3 cm2 V−1 s−1.357,377 It has a much lower HOMO and LUMO levels than the previous molecules, which is the main reason that it allows easy electron injection. Furthermore, TIPS-TAP (358, Fig. 32) forms a 2D brickwork arrangement that helps the electron transport. The authors further used the drop cast method with mixed solvents to get an ultrathin single crystalline ribbon with an electron mobility of 1.77 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is one of the highest values reported for a solution-processed n-channel semiconductor.387 Recently, they changed the device structure, using 12-cyclohexyldodecyl-phosphonic acid (CDPA)-modified AlOx/SiO2 as the insulator; the solution-processed polycrystalline thin films of TIPS-TAP (358, Fig. 32) can achieve a very high mobility of up to 11.1 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Recently, Miao et al. synthesized a series of halogenated TAP and reported the molecule of 4Cl-TAP (364, Fig. 32), which showed the highest mobility of 27.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 for n-type organic semiconductors.99 As shown in Fig. 33, with the introduction of F– and Cl– atoms, both F-TAP (359, Fig. 32) and 4Cl-TAP (364, Fig. 32) show a 2D “bricklayer” packing. Although slightly disordered arrangements are observed in the molecular structures of F-TAP and 4Cl-TAP, small π–π distances of 3.29 and 3.37 Å along the adjacent four molecules of F-TAP are formed, while π–π distances of 3.402 and 3.42 Å along adjacent four molecules of 4Cl-TAP are observed. The theoretical calculations reveal that the chlorine substituents in 4Cl-TAP slightly decrease the reorganization energy as well as increase electron transfer integrals, which contribute to the high electron mobility.

When the symmetrical TIPS side chain of TIPS-TAP is replaced with an asymmetrical norbornadienyl substituent (Nor), the HOMO/LUMO level of Nor-TAP (366, Fig. 32) was slightly lower than that of TIPS-TAP. However, the mobility (3.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of Nor-TAP is one order lower than that of TIPS-TAP.386
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 32 are shown in Table S23 of the ESI.†
In 2004, Cornil et al. theoretically predicted that the charge mobility would be increased with increasing fused rings from triphenylene to 5,6,11,12,17,18-hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATNA, 367, Fig. 34).399,400 In the outer benzene rings of HATNA, 12 positions can be substituted with alkylthio chains (369–373,399,401,402376–381,400393 and 394,403Fig. 34), halogen atoms (374–383,253,400,404395,253Fig. 34), alkyl groups (387–390,403Fig. 34), alkylethynyl groups (391 and 392,403Fig. 34), pentafluorobenzyl groups (384–386,405Fig. 34), etc. The HATNA and derivatives show different properties when various side chains are introduced.
 Fig. 34  Organic small molecules of HATNA and its derivatives. 
Because of the presence of nitrogen atoms, HATNA is an electron-efficient building block and is an important unit of electron transport materials. Some results indicated that HATNA and some derivatives could form liquid crystal phases. For example, electron-donating groups, alkylthio groups (370–373, Fig. 34),401 can be introduced at the R1-, R2-, R3-, and R4-positions located at the outer benzene rings of HATNA to form liquid crystal phases.401,402 The measured liquid crystal phase mobilities of compounds 370–373 (Fig. 34) are dependent on the side chains, from 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 0.32 cm2 V−1 s−1.401 The crystalline compound 372 has a mobility of 0.87 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was higher than the value in the liquid crystal phase.401
Compound 386 (Fig. 34), synthesized by Marder et al., is a mixture of two isomers (384 and 385, Fig. 34), in which the R3- and R4-positions cannot be distinguished.405 The thin films of compound 386 (Fig. 34) are in amorphous states,405 while pure compounds 384 and 385 (Fig. 34) are easily crystallized. According to the steady-state space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) technique, the mixture can achieve a hole mobility of 0.021 cm2 V−1 s−1, and pure compound 385 (Fig. 34) can achieve a mobility of 0.071 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to the high crystalline thin films.405
In addition to the R1–R4 position substitutions, the R5-position can also be decorated with some alkyl groups (387–390, Fig. 34), alkylethynyl groups (391 and 392, Fig. 34), and alkylthio chains (393 and 394, Fig. 34).403 The results showed that octylthio-substituted HATNA gives an electron mobility of 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.403
The selected halogenation of the R1–R5 positions can yield HATNA-F6 (374, Fig. 34),253,400 HATNA-Cl6 (375, Fig. 34),404 and HATNA-F12 (395, Fig. 34). Some results showed that the introduction of pyridine groups could decrease both the HOMO and LUMO levels, while the introduction of halogen atoms can obviously decrease the LUMO levels but sparingly affect the HOMO levels. The former can only facilitate electron transport, while the latter may realize both p-type and n-type transport.
The combination of side chains of halogen atoms and alkylsulfanyl groups at different positions can give an average mobility of ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Many potential applications of N-heteropentacenes have been demonstrated, including photodetectors,406 solar cells, and fluorine dyes.359

8.3 Quinacridone-based polymers
As a traditional pigment material, quinacridone and its derivatives construct various colorant applications. Also, it can be used as the main building unit for polymerization.
Quinacridone can be regarded as a large π-core and can be used as the building block to construct polymers. Quinacridone shows n-type charge transport, and thiophene and pyrrole groups together with quinacridone can be combined to build poly(D–A) structures. The typical reported quinacridone-based polymer molecules are shown in Fig. 35. All of the quinacridone-based polymers offer p-type charge transport with a hole mobility range of 10−4 to 0.67 cm2 V−1 s−1.407–412 In 2015, Fu et al. introduced a vinylene linkage into a quinacridone-based polymer to form PQTE (403, Fig. 35). Due to the formation of a thiophene–vinylene–thiophene unit, strong interchain interaction with a π–π interplane distance of 3.49 Å is found in PQTE, which is responsible for the high hole mobility of 0.67 cm2 V−1 s−1.407 Without the vinylene linkage, the hole mobility of PQA2T (396, Fig. 35) thin films is 0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1.407
 Fig. 35  Quinacridone-based polymer molecules. 
In 2012, Takimiya et al. studied the influence of thiophene groups with different chain lengths and molecular weights for the charge transport of quinacridone-based polymers and obtained a hole mobility of ∼0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1.409 In 2016, they introduced a series of side groups into PQA2Ts, including 2-decyltetradecyl (396, Fig. 35), 3-decylpentadecyl (400, Fig. 35), 4-decylhexadecyl (401, Fig. 35), and 5-decylheptadecyl (402, Fig. 35) to study the branching position dependence of the mobilities.408 The results indicate that, when the branching positions are moved away from the backbone, the π–π interplane distances are gradually decreased, and the hole mobilities of PQA2Ts increase from 0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 0.33 cm2 V−1 s−1, revealing the influences of branching positions on the intermolecular interaction and charge transport.408
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 35 are shown in Table S25 of the ESI.†
9. Ternary hybrids among acenes, cyclopenta-1,3-dienes, and thiophenes
9.1 Five-ring-fused organic small molecules based on hybrids between acenes, cyclopenta-1,3-dienes, and thiophenes
Benzene, cyclopenta-1,3-diene, and thiophene can be fused together to form five-ring-fused organic semiconductors (412–436, Fig. 36).133,413–425 A benzene ring is located at the center position, and two cyclopenta-1,3-dienes can be combined at both ends of benzene. Then two thiophene rings were fused at both ends. Similar to indenofluorenes, carbonyl (412–414, Fig. 36),133,413 cyanovinylene (415 and 416, Fig. 36),413,426N-cyanoimine (417 and 418, Fig. 36),424 or alkyl (419 and 420, Fig. 36)414 groups can be introduced into the carbon atom of the cyclopenta-1,3-diene ring. The introduction of carbonyl groups in this kind of ternary hybrid five-ring-fused organic semiconductor can result in ambipolar transport or p-type transport, while the introduction of cyanovinylene groups can induce pure n-type transport behavior because the latter can make the compound have a much lower LUMO level which allows electron injection easily.413 The alkyl groups at the thiophene ring improve the material solubility and have very similar hole mobilities of ∼10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1.133,413 It is worth indicating that thin films of compound 415 (Fig. 36) have an electron mobility of 0.33 cm2 V−1 s−1,413 and thin films of compound 416 (Fig. 36) obtained by a blade coating method can get the highest value of 0.49 cm2 V−1 s−1.426

9.2 Polymers based on hybrids between acenes, cyclopenta-1,3-dienes, and thiophenes
A five-ring-fused building block based on the ternary hybrids among an acene, cyclopenta-1,3-diene, and thiophene can be used as the basic unit for polymerization (437–442, Fig. 37).427–433 The use of the indacenodithiophene (IDT) backbone can reduce the energetic disorder due to the coplanar molecular packing. One typical example is the polymer IDTBT (437, Fig. 37),427–431,434,435 which has attracted great attention because the combination of electron-rich IDT and electron-poor benzothiadiazole (BT) can further improve the π-conjugation stacking and form close intermolecular π-stacking distance. The hole mobility of IDTBT can be as high as 1.2 cm2 V−1 s−1.427 After optimization of device fabrication, the mobility of IDTBT can be increased up to 3.6 cm2 V−1 s−1.428 The high performance of IDTBT is attributed to the absence of long-range order and the rigid IDT backbone. The latter may induce various orientations on the substrate, both amorphous and crystalline regions.428 Another similar polymer, IDTTT (438, Fig. 37), based on IDT and a fused thiophene ([3,2-b]thiophene, TT) can result in a hole mobility of 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off ratio of >106.427 Furthermore, both fluorinated BT and IDT can be combined with IDT to form an IFBT-TT polymer (439, Fig. 37). IFBT-TT has a molecular packing with a D1–A–D2–A alternative configuration, and the C–H⋯N and F⋯S weak intermolecular interactions make the molecular packing remain planar and rigid. It is surprising that the spin-coated amorphous thin films of IFBT-TT can give a very high hole mobility of 5.01 cm2 V−1 s−1.432
 Fig. 37  The polymer with a five-ring-fused building block of the ternary hybrid among an acene, cyclopenta-1,3-diene, and thiophene. 
Another great backbone is dithieno[3,2-b:6,7-b]fluorene (DTF), in which two thiophene rings are fused at both ends of the fluorene unit. DTF can combine thiophene and fused pyrroles and three alternating D–A copolymers; PDTFDPP16 (440, Fig. 37), PDTFDPP20 (441, Fig. 37), and PDTFDPP32 (442, Fig. 37) can be synthesized. The appropriate side chains, especially introduction of lateral alkyl chains, make PDTFDPP20 have a great hole mobility of 5.26 cm2 V−1 s−1, at least two orders higher than those of PDTFDPP16 and PDTFDPP32. It is also the highest value for the five-ring-fused-based polymer. The precise control of the molecular packing of PDTFDPP20 makes it form a face-on orientation on the substrate, and the rigid and planar DTF backbone makes this face-on packing efficient for charge transport.433
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 37 are shown in Table S27 of the ESI.†
10. Ternary hybrids among acenes, cyclopenta-1,3-dienes, and pyrazines
Indenofluorenes are typical OLED materials. When two carbon atoms of the central benzene are replaced with imine groups, their electronic structures and properties are obviously changed (443–452, Fig. 38).120,121,129 The introduction of the imine group can further lower the LUMO level and allow electron injection. One example can be found in compound 443 (Fig. 38),129 which is the analog of compound 012 (Fig. 3), and the former is an n-type semiconductor with a mobility of 2.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the latter does not show any performance. Another example, 6,6,12,12-tetraethyl-2,8-bis-[1,10;30,10]terphenyl-40-yl-6,12-dihydro-diindeno[1,2-b;10,20-e]pyrazine (TP-EPY, 452, Fig. 38),121 is an analogue of TP-EIF (004, Fig. 3). The time-of-flight measurements indicate that TP-EPY has higher hole mobility than TP-EIY, and TP-EPY has weak electron transport, while TP-EIY does not show n-type behavior. The side chains of compound 443 include halogen atoms (444–446, Fig. 38),120 alkyl groups (447, 449, Fig. 38),120 and hexanoyl groups (448, Fig. 38).120 All these derivatives show n-type characteristics with a mobility range of 10−5–10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1.120 The fluorinated substitution group of compound 443 (444, Fig. 38) can give an electron mobility of 0.011 cm2 V−1 s−1, but it is hard to dissolve into an organic solvent.120 The alkyl substitution can improve the solubility, but the mobility is decreased.120

11. Ternary hybrids among acenes, thiophenes, and pyrroles
11.1 Small molecules based on ternary hybrids among acenes, thiophenes, and pyrroles
Small molecules of ternary hybrids among acenes, thiophenes, and pyrroles can have few possibilities for the combination. However, only one backbone can be used for application in organic field-effect transistors, in which one pyrrole ring is located at the central position, and two thiophene rings are fused on both sides of the main pyrrole ring, then two benzene rings finally are fused on both sides. The existence of anti-/syn-isomers depends on the position of the pyrrole ring. The nitrogen atom located in the same direction as the sulfur atom forms a syn-isomer (453–456, Fig. 39), while the nitrogen atom position in a different direction forms an anti-isomer (457–459, Fig. 39).436–438 The results indicate that a single crystal of α-PDBTP (454, Fig. 39) with an anti-isomer made by drop casting shows a hole mobility of 0.75 cm2 V−1 s−1.437

11.2 Polymers with building blocks based on ternary hybrids among acenes, thiophenes, and pyrroles
Also, a five-ring-fused hybrid molecule among acene, thiophene, and pyrrole units can be used as the backbone for polymerization. One backbone is dithieno[2,3-b;7,6-b]carbazole, in which two thiophene rings are fused at both ends of carbazole. Three conjugated polymers (P-bTC10, P-bTC12, P-bTC16, 460–462, Fig. 40) are synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction by changing the length of alkyl side chains at the thiophene ring.439 The central nitrogen atoms allow the introduction of alkyl chains, which give high solubility. Of the three similar polymers, P-bTC16 shows the best hole mobility (0.035 cm2 V−1 s−1).439
 Fig. 40  The polymer with a five-ring-fused building block of a ternary hybrid among acene, thiophene, and pyrrole units. 
Another backbone for polymerization is pyrroloindacenodithiophene (PIDT), in which more nitrogen atoms are introduced to expect enhanced molecular orbital hybrids and lower band gaps (463–469, Fig. 40).440,441 The best performance is obtained from compound 465 (Fig. 40) with a hole mobility of 0.07 cm2 V−1 s−1.441
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 40 are shown in Table S30 of the ESI.†
12. Ternary hybrids among acenes, thiophenes, and pyrazines
The hybrids among acene, thiophene, and pyrazine groups can be found in tetrathienophenazine derivatives (470–475, Fig. 41).258 The differences among these compounds depend on the positions of four thiophene rings. Vacuum deposited thin films of compounds 470–475 (Fig. 41) show low hole mobilities, while the theoretically calculated mobility of compound 472 (Fig. 41) is 0.76 cm2 V−1 s−1.258

13. Other five-ring-fused organic molecules
13.1 Other five-ring-fused organic small molecules
Other hybrid ways include the introduction of cyclohepta-1,3,5-triene (476–479, Fig. 42),442,443 thiazine (480–482, Fig. 42),444,445 cyclobuta-1,3-diene (483–488, Fig. 42),446 thiadiazole (494–499, Fig. 42),447–450 hybrid benzofuran, benzothiophene and thienopyrrole (501 and 502, Fig. 42),438 selenophene and thiophene (503 and 504, Fig. 42),323 tellurophene and thiophene (505, Fig. 42),323etc.451,452
 Fig. 42  Other hybrid five-ring-fused small molecules. 
Miao et al. used a seven-membered ring to replace one five-membered ring of indenofluorene, and this substitution increases the rigid π-conjugation length from twenty π electrons to twenty-two π electrons. This unsymmetrical molecule (476, Fig. 42) consists of six-, seven-, six-, five-, and six-membered rings and contributes a p-type mobility of 0.025 cm2 V−1 s−1.442 Furthermore, the same group made a further increase of the rigid π-conjugation length for compound 476 and synthesized compounds (477–479, Fig. 42).443 The TIPS substitution at the seven-membered rings of this symmetrical molecule rapidly increased the mobility up to 0.76 cm2 V−1 s−1.442,443
The introduction of five-membered or seven-membered rings can change the π electrons of the rigid plane of the molecule but only result in p-type semiconductors. Miao et al. kept using N-heteroacenes as the building blocks to discover novel n-type semiconductors. Similar to TIPS-DHTAP-2p (349, Fig. 31), cyclobuta[1,2-b:3,4-b′]diquinoxaline (483, Fig. 42)446 was synthesized in which the central benzene ring is replaced with a four-membered ring of cyclobuta-1,3-diene, and halogen atoms can be substituted on both sides of the benzene rings (484–488, Fig. 42).446 The results indicate that upon increasing the number of halogen atoms, the LUMO level of the molecule is further lower to allow electron injection, and introduction of four chlorine atoms results in a better n-type mobility of 0.42 cm2 V−1 s−1.121,446
The introduction of the thiazine group was discovered in 1969; the thiazine group was first synthesized by Dimroth et al.453 Xu et al. applied 6H-pyrrolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]bis[1,4]benzothiazine (PBBTZ, 480, Fig. 42) and its derivatives (481 and 482, Fig. 42) in field-effect transistors.444,445 PBBTZ is a rigid, linear, and planar structure similar to pentacene. Thin films of PBBTZ have a hole mobility of 0.34 cm2 V−1 s−1, while single crystals of PBBTZ have a higher value of 3.6 cm2 V−1 s−1.444,445 The central nitrogen atoms can be functionalized with different side groups to improve the solubility of the molecule. However, the alkyl or benzene group substitution decreases the mobility by one order, although the solubility is improved.
The theoretical calculations reveal that introducing thiadiazole groups can lower the positive charge transport reorganization energy and give good charge transport properties. In 2011, Pei et al. synthesized TES- and TIPS-substituted aceno[2,1,3]thiadiazoles (496 and 497, Fig. 42).448 These unsymmetrical molecules can easily self-assemble into micro-/nano-wires via π–π interaction. Compound 497 (Fig. 42) has a higher hole mobility of 0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while TES-substituted compound 496 (Fig. 42) has a lower value of 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1.448 Another similar use of the thiadiazole group was made by Zhang et al. in which quinoxaline was put into the central position, and a thiadiazole was fused on the one side, and a pyrene derivative was fused on the other side. This kind of donor–acceptor π-conjugated small molecule has a hole mobility of 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1.447
An electron-withdrawing thiazole ring with carbonyl groups can further improve electron transport. Ie et al. synthesized the backbone of 4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiazole-4,9-dione as an electronegative unit and reported a symmetrical π-conjugated compound, 2C-TzPhTz (499, Fig. 42).449 2C-TzPhTz is an air-stable n-type semiconductor with a mobility of 0.39 cm2 V−1 s−1.449
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 42 are shown in Table S32 of the ESI.†
13.2 Other five-ring-fused based organic polymers
Silaindacenodithiophene (SiIDT) can be used as a basic unit for polymerization. The introduction of silicon can make the silicon–carbon bond longer and lower the HOMO level as well as stabilize the LUMO level. In sequence, the band gap is reduced, and the stability is improved.
Ashraf et al. synthesized compounds 509 and 510 (Fig. 43) via Stille cross-coupling.454 Compared to compound 509 (Fig. 43), compound 510 (Fig. 43) introduces fused pyrrole rings to prompt intermolecular association, and alkyl side groups can be substituted to improve the charge transport. Compound 510 (Fig. 43) shows balanced ambipolar performance with a hole mobility of 0.65 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1.454 The authors further synthesized similar copolymers SiIDT-BT (511, Fig. 43), SiIDT-2FBT (512, Fig. 43), SiIDT-DTBT (513, Fig. 43), and SiIDT-2FDTBT (514, Fig. 43).455 The fluorine atoms are introduced to tune the electronic structures of the copolymer. SiIDT-DTBT has a better hole mobility of 0.28 cm2 V−1 s−1.455
 Fig. 43  The polymers with other five-ring-fused building blocks. 
Guo et al. reported a novel building block of dithienylbenzodiimide (TBDI) for polymerization (515–517, Fig. 43).456 TBDI is a non-planar configuration but has a tight π stacking interaction. Due to the strong electron-withdrawing abilities of imide groups, the lower LUMO level of the polymer has n-type behavior. The TBDI-based polymer has a wide bandgap and low-lying frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), which improve the n-type transport as well as hinder the p-type transport. The fluorinated TBDI-DFDT has a pure n-type mobility of 0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while non-fluorinated TBDI-DT has ambipolar behavior with a hole mobility of 0.015 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1.456
Bithiophene imide (BTI) can be used as an efficient acceptor unit to construct an n-type polymer. However, polymers based on BTI show limited mobility and stability since the electron-rich thiophene rings may increase the LUMO levels of the polymers. As a possible solution, strong electron-withdrawing cyano groups can be introduced into the BTI building block, and improved performance and stability are expected. Guo et al. synthesized a series of polymers based on cyano-functionalized BTI, and spin-coated thin films of PCNDTI (518, Fig. 43) and PCNDTI-BTI (519, Fig. 43) can achieve an electron mobility of 4.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.013 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.457 This provides another effective way to construct n-type polymers with good solubility and electronic properties.
The performance statistics of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors in Fig. 43 are shown in Table S33 of the ESI.†
14. The HOMO–LUMO levels of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors
Pentacene is unstable with light illumination, and the HOMO and LUMO levels of pentacene are reported to be −5.0 eV and −3.2 eV, respectively.162 The molecular engineering of pentacene has been performed to lower the HOMO levels of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors, which can efficiently improve the stability. Fig. 44 shows the reported HOMO and LUMO levels of some prototype five-ring-fused molecules based on the molecular engineering of pentacene. It is inspiring to observe that the HOMO levels of all five-ring-fused molecules are lower than that of pentacene. The lowest HOMO level (−6.59 eV) is observed in compound 483 (Fig. 42).
 Fig. 44  The HOMO–LUMO levels of some prototype five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. The value near the molecular structure represents the reported mobility (cm2 V−1 s−1) for the prototype molecule. 
When alkyl groups with different chain lengths are introduced on both sides of PDT-1 (130, Fig. 8), a negligible change in the HOMO levels for compounds 131–136 (Fig. 8) is observed.264 Similar results are reported in compounds 194–197 (Fig. 13).295 Also, the isomeric structures can result in similar HOMO levels such as anti-ADT and syn-ADT.161 On the other hand, with the increase of the chain length of alkyl groups on one side of ATT (156, Fig. 10), the HOMO levels of ATT derivatives (157–160, Fig. 10) experience a further reduction from −5.30 eV to −5.66 eV, indicating that ATT derivatives can be much more stable than the prototype ATT.270
The halogen atoms decorated on both sides of TIPS-TAP can make both the HOMO and LUMO levels further decreased.
Analyzed from Fig. 44, seven prototype five-ring-fused organic semiconducting building blocks can achieve mobilities higher than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 (the mobility value of the prototype molecule is indexed near the molecule), and may be good candidates for further molecular design or crystal engineering to obtain high performance organic semiconductors.
The detailed HOMO and LUMO values and the corresponding references in Fig. 44 are shown in Table S34 (ESI†).
15. The synthesis of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors
Compared with traditional inorganic semiconductors of silicon and gallium arsenide, organic semiconductors have the unique advantages of low processing temperature and large-scale synthesis. However, the synthesis of pentacene, a successful organic semiconductor, requires a quite complicated process, which makes the fabrication cost uncompetitive in the market. Instead, the improvement of the synthesis steps should be made to decrease the fabrication cost.
PBBTZ (480, Fig. 42) can be obtained via one-step synthesis. The synthesis route can be shown in Fig. 45a, and the starting materials 2-aminothiophenol and 2,3-dichloromaleimides can be commercially available. One-step condensation via Dimroth's method453 can afford PBBTZ (480, Fig. 42) in 66–83% yield.444 A single crystal of PBBTZ (480, Fig. 42) has a hole mobility of 3.6 cm2 V−1 s−1.445 However, it is difficult for PBBTZ (480, Fig. 42) to dissolve into organic solvents, and the alkyl group introduction of PBBTZ results in an improved solubility but a lower mobility of 0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1.445
 Fig. 45  The chemical synthesis within three steps for some five-ring-fused organic semiconductors with mobilities larger than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1. 
Another example of a one-step synthesis is DNS-W (232, Fig. 17), which can be obtained by heating α-naphthol in a degassed sealed Pyrex tube at 400 °C for ten hours. Although the fabrication cost of DNF-W is low, the mobility of DNF-W is measured to be ∼0.02–0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1.158 DNS-W (232, Fig. 19),158 5,11-ICZ (240, Fig. 21) and TCDAHP (327, Fig. 28) can be obtained by a two-step synthesis route as shown in Fig. 45b–d. It is also surprising that the reported mobilities of DNS-W (2.0 cm2 V−1 s−1),158 5,11-ICZ (1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1)329 and TCDAHP (1.4 cm2 V−1 s−1)380 can be larger than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, DNS-W experiences a low yield of 8%,158 while 5,11-ICZ has poor solubility in organic solvents.328
The synthesis cost can make a big difference for commercial applications. It is necessary to decrease the synthesis steps as well as use cheap source materials or precursors. The above four examples can provide us with a direct experience to synthesize high-performance organic semiconductors at a low cost. Also, the solution processability should be considered to meet commercial fabrication requirements.
For the chemical synthesis of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors, some points should be considered. (1) The molecule structure had better be as simple as it can be. Although it is inconclusive that simple or complicated molecular structures will result in better performance, it is recommended that five-ring-fused organic molecules as simple as they can be are synthesized. (2) Side chains with appropriate chain lengths are introduced into the five-ring-fused building block to improve the solution processability. Some prototype five-ring-fused molecules such as pentacene, ADT, and ICZ do not dissolve into most organic solvents, which adds the fabrication cost when a physical vapor transport method is needed to purify and grow single crystals of target molecules. The existence of side chains in five-ring-fused building blocks can increase the solubility in organic solvents as well as improve the molecular packing for efficient charge transport. (3) The synthesis process should be done within three steps. Some five-ring-fused organic semiconductors show high mobilities of larger than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1. For the synthesis process, it is better to limit the chemical synthesis process to three steps so that the fabrication cost can be controlled to achieve large-scale production. (4) The yields of target molecules should be as high as they can be. The rational design of the synthesis route can be done to realize efficient synthesis. The purity of source materials, the synthesis route, selection of the catalyst, and the intermediate product may finally affect the yield of the target molecules. The above parameters should be carefully considered. The synthesis route can be efficiently used when we combine the successful experience and machine learning to design an optimum feasible program.
In a word, for the consideration of low fabrication cost in commercial applications, the chemical synthesis of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors should consider a simple target molecular structure with good solution processability, which can be synthesized within three steps with high yields.
16. The molecular packing of five-ring-fused organic molecules
The molecular packing can affect the charge transport properties of organic semiconductors. There are four typical molecular packings in five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. (1) Herringbone packing. Pentacene has a typical herringbone packing. The molecular structures of many prototype five-ring-fused molecules are still herringbone packing. For example, compounds 001 (Fig. 3), 079 (Fig. 6), 085 (Fig. 8), 167 (Fig. 11), and 240 (Fig. 21) show similar herringbone packings as shown in Fig. 46a, and the detailed packing of 5,11-ICZ is displayed in Fig. 46b. (2) Cofacial herringbone packing. A typical example is C6-DBTDT (168, Fig. 11), as shown in Fig. 46c and d. The introduction of side chains makes C6-DBTDT form efficient overlapping between two adjacent molecules. (3) 1D “slipped stack” packing. Typical examples include compounds 006 (Fig. 3), 184 (Fig. 13), and 340 (Fig. 29). In these cases, the molecules show a layer-by-layer packing, as shown in Fig. 46f. (4) 2D “bricklayer” packing. Typical examples include compounds 099 (Fig. 8) and 100 (Fig. 8). Some special groups such as TIPS are introduced into five-ring-fused building blocks to form 2D “bricklayer” structures.
 Fig. 46  Typical four molecular packing modes for five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. (a and b) Herringbone packing. (c and d) Cofacial herringbone packing. (e and f) 1D “slipped stack” packing. (g and h) 2D “bricklayer” packing. 
According to side chain engineering, the molecular packing of some five-ring-fused building blocks can be changed from herringbone to cofacial herringbone, herringbone to 1D “slipped stack” or even from herringbone to 2D “bricklayer” packing. The typical examples are shown in Fig. 47. DBTDT displays a herringbone packing when the head of one molecule is towards the tail of another adjacent molecule. (1) Conversion from herringbone to cofacial herringbone. When alkyl groups are introduced on both sides of DBTDT (167, Fig. 11), the cofacial herringbone packing is observed in C6-DBTDT (168, Fig. 11) since the alkyl groups of C6-DBTDT improve the overlapping between two adjacent molecules (Fig. 47a). A single crystal of DBTDT (167, Fig. 11) made from physical vapor transport has a hole mobility of 1.8 cm2 V−1 s−1,273 while C6-DBTDT (168, Fig. 11) shows good solution processability and drop cast can achieve a higher mobility of 18.9 cm2 V−1 s−1.98 It is a good example that the introduction of alkyl groups can result in improved solution processability as well as increase the mobility.
 Fig. 47  Typical examples of conversion from (a) herringbone to cofacial herringbone, (b) herringbone to 1D “slipped stack”, and (c) herringbone to 2D “bricklayer” packing. 
(2) Conversion from herringbone to 1D “slipped stack” packing. Indenofluorene (IF, 001, Fig. 3) has a herringbone packing, when side chains are decorated at 6-, and 12- positions of IF, 1D “slipped stack” packing can be observed in the IF-TTF (006, Fig. 3). IF (001, Fig. 3) does not display any field-effect mobility, while a single crystal of α phase IF-TTF (006, Fig. 3) fabricated by solution casting shows a hole mobility of 1.44 cm2 V−1 s−1.108 (3) Conversion from herringbone to 2D “bricklayer” packing. ADT (085, Fig. 8) shows a herringbone packing; when TES groups are introduced into the middle benzene of ADT, a 2D “bricklayer” packing is formed in TES-ADT (099, Fig. 8). Thin films of anti-ADT (085, Fig. 8) made by vacuum deposition show a hole mobility of 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1,161 while thin films of TES-ADT (099, Fig. 8) fabricated by drop casting,186,194 spin coating,183,189,193,195,197 or dip coating191 can achieve hole mobilities of more than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1.
It is acceptable that an efficient charge transport can be realized by molecular engineering based on five-ring-fused building blocks. From the viewpoint of molecular design, five-ring-fused building blocks with functional groups can be considered to construct a molecule structure with a good balance between high mobility and good solution solubility. Many experiments indicate that the molecular packing affects the charge transport of organic semiconductors, and a slight change of side chains on the main building unit may result in a significantly different molecular packing and related mobility. So the molecular design with detailed analysis of molecular packing can efficiently guide us to obtain ideal organic semiconductors for applications.
17. Side-chain engineering of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors
The replacement of benzene rings with thiophenes, pyrroles, furans, selenophenes, tellurophenes, etc., changes the electronic structures of pentacene, and the corresponding electronic properties are also changed. Some experimentally empirical rules for side-chain engineering can be generalized as follows.
17.1 The length of the alkyl group
The introduction of alkyl groups can improve solubility, tune the length of π conjugation and enhance intermolecular interaction. The length of the alkyl group may dramatically change the electronic properties of organic semiconductors. Short alkyl groups slightly change the electronic structure and molecular packing, while long alkyl groups may have a dramatic change. It is necessary to add a suitable length of alkyl chains for engineering. Some systematic results concerning the length of alkyl groups’ dependence on the charge transport mobility are shown in Fig. 48. The results show that either short alkyl groups or long alkyl groups can give higher mobilities, depending on the different building blocks.
 Fig. 48  The statistical results of the length of alkyl groups dependent on the field-effect mobilities in some five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. The value near the compound marked with a red color represents the reported mobility (cm2 V−1 s−1). 
Further alkyl groups include alkylthienyl-substituted groups (161–164, Fig. 10) and alkylthio groups (370–373, Fig. 34), and moderate lengths of such alkyl groups can result in higher mobilities.
17.2 Halogen atoms
The electron transport properties of organic semiconductors can be tuned via the introduction of different electron-withdrawing groups. The halogen atoms (F–, Cl–, Br–) can be decorated with the outside benzene rings. Two systematic results discuss the influence of halogen atoms on charge transport properties (Fig. 49). The performance of fluorine decoration is much higher than the other halogen atom substitution or non-halogen substitution.

17.3 Other side-chain substitution effects
The insertion of side chains such as TMS, TES, and TIPS can dramatically change the solution process abilities of organic semiconductors. Fig. 50 shows the functions of TMS, TES, and TIPS in the charge transport properties of some typical five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. It is worth indicating that the introduction of TIPS can highly increase the mobility of organic semiconductors as well as maintain good solution processability.

18. The difficulties and the prospects of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors
The synthesis of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors includes many possibilities. However, only a few hundred chemical molecules are designed and synthesized for application in organic field-effect transistors. The disadvantages of the synthesis include multiple synthesis steps, low yields, and mixtures of isomers; especially it is difficult to distinguish different isomers since their intrinsic properties may be seriously affected by the displacement of various positions. The current difficulties are summarized as follows.
18.1 High performance five-ring-fused organic semiconductors
Side chain decoration includes alkyl substitution, halogen substitution, etc. A high mobility of 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 or even values higher than 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be obtained via molecular design and side-chain engineering.458 Analyzed from the above described 519 molecules, seven five-ring-fused molecules can reach high mobilities of >10 cm2 V−1 s−1 (1.3%, 7/519) as shown in Fig. 51. It is interesting to find that five molecules are symmetrical (100, 168, 177, 358, 364), while two molecules (182, 183) are asymmetrical. The highest hole mobility of ∼18.9 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility of ∼27.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 are obtained from the symmetrical molecules. The statistical results of the seven superstar molecules are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 52. Analyzed from Fig. 52, higher mobilities generally come from small molecules (100%), fused aromatic rings (100%), and linear building structures (100%), while the morphologies, charge transport types, and molecular packing ways are not dominated by one factor. We have extended the research objectives into molecules with their reported mobilities higher than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 (11.6%, 60/519, detailed results for these 519 molecules can also be seen in the ESI†). Correspondingly, the statistical results are displayed in Table 2 and Fig. 53. Analyzed from Fig. 53, small molecules (95%, 57/60) with fused aromatic rings (88.3%, 53/60) and linear structures (81.7%, 49/60) can achieve high mobilities, while the most reported types are pure hole transport materials (85%, 51/60).

 Fig. 53  The statistical results of five-ring-fused organic molecules with mobilities higher than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1. (a) Small molecules and polymers. (b) Fused aromatic, aromatic and non-aromatic, and non-aromatic rings. (c) Linear and angular structures. (d) The morphologies of both single crystals and thin films, pure single crystals and pure thin films. (e) Electronic properties of p-type hole, ambipolar, and n-type electron transport. (f) Four molecular packing ways – herringbone, cofacial herringbone, 1D slipped-stack and 2D bricklayer. 
Some molecular design engineering clues can be summarized as follows. (1) Thiophene is a good building unit to replace the benzene ring, and the performance of such thiophene-substituted five-ring-fused is higher than others. (2) A single crystal can induce high mobility and reflect the intrinsic properties of organic semiconductors. Single-crystal growth of organic semiconductors is recommended to study the structure–property relationship.459 (3) The introduction of a suitable length of alkyl groups can improve the solution processability as well as maintain good molecular packing for efficient charge transport. Although no direct clues for the length of alkyl groups can be made to design high-performance organic semiconductors, molecular design and crystal engineering, together with a large number of experiments, can be used to optimize the molecular structures with a suitable length of alkyl groups for an aim of good solution processability and high mobility. (4) Asymmetrical structures can normally give higher mobility, while unsymmetrical molecules result in lower mobility.
18.2 The overestimation of charge carrier mobility
Mobility is the most important parameter in organic field-effect transistors.460–462 The higher the mobility value can be, the better the materials are. Depending on the different lab conditions and different measurement parameters, the reported mobilities for the same materials may be different. For example, in pentacene, the mobility can range from 10−5 to a few tens of cm2 V−1 s−1.463–467 The calculation of charge carrier mobility can use either linear zone or saturated mobility. It is possible to overestimate the charge carrier mobility of materials since nonlinearities in the current–voltage characteristics are found in organic thin-film transistors. As a solution, the width to length ratio had better be more than 20 as well as the mobilities of using the linear-zone and saturated-zone are better provided to give us a comparatively accurate value for reference.
18.3 Different positions of alkyl chains
Alkyl groups can be decorated at different positions of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. There are many positions that can be chemically decorated on the five-ring-fused building block. For example, alkyl groups with different lengths can be introduced at the twelve positions of IF (Fig. 3). The lengths and the positions of alkyl groups in five-ring-fused organic semiconductors may affect their electronic properties. From the viewpoint of chemical synthesis, the selection of different chemical precursors may induce the introduction of alkyl groups at different positions, which results in analogs. It is hard to separate the molecular structures of analogs by chemical purification. For example, it is difficult to distinguish Me-ABT-a (073, Fig. 6) from Me-ABT-b (074, Fig. 6) in which the methyl group is located at closed positions. So the precise introduction of alkyl groups at five-ring-fused organic semiconductors is better to be adopted to study the structure–property relationship.
18.4 Isomeric effect on the charge transport
The introduction of more than one thiophene or pyrrole ring in five-ring-fused organic semiconductors will probably give an isomeric structure. Until now, no conclusion have been made to confirm which kind of configuration (anti-/syn-) can result in higher performance.286Table 3 shows the statistical data of the reported isomers with field-effect mobility in some typical five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. From the displayed results, it is hard to determine which configuration will result in higher mobilities. Some results indicate that anti-isomers will contribute much higher mobility, while other results reveal that syn-isomers will give higher mobilities than syn-isomers.

For the discussion of the isomeric effect on the charge transport of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors, we may refer to our recently published review.286
19. Conclusions and perspectives
In this review article, aiming at the disadvantages of pentacene, both the alternation of the main building block and side chain engineering are introduced to give a general understanding of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. The benzene rings can be replaced with four-membered rings (cyclobuta-1,3-diene), five-membered rings (thiophene, pyrrole, furan, selenophene, tellurophene), six-membered rings (pyridine, pyrazine, etc.), or even seven-member-rings. The hybrids can be binary or ternary combinations among these building blocks. Around 519 organic small molecules and polymer together with the electronic properties are listed and summarized in this review. The mobilities of many molecules can be higher than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 or even 10 cm2 V−1 s−1. Some points can be summarized as follows. (1) By selecting the suitable five-ring-fused building block and appropriate side chains, a hole mobility of up to 18.9 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be obtained in C6-DBTDT, while an electron mobility of 27.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be achieved in 4Cl-TAP. It is expectable that novel five-ring-fused organic semiconductors with high mobility, good solution processability, and environmental stability can be obtained by molecular design. (2) The chemical synthesis of five-ring-fused organic molecules can be precisely controlled to meet the requirement of low fabrication cost. The synthesis route can be rationally designed to achieve simple molecular structures within three steps with high yields. (3) The molecular packing can affect the charge transport of five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. The consideration of the mature building blocks and functional groups together with efficient molecular packing can be made to obtain high-performance five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. Five-ring-fused organic semiconductors have promising prospects for future electronics used for commercial applications. Before commercial application, there are some aspects that should be addressed. (1) Compared with many p-type five-ring-fused organic semiconductors, n-type five-ring-fused organic semiconductors are rare, and it is necessary to design and synthesize high mobility n-type five-ring-fused organic semiconductors. (2) The design strategy should consider many parameters, including high mobility, low fabrication cost, good solution processability, and high stability. Although there is some experience designing such molecules, we are still motivated to fabricate dominant molecules such as silicon in inorganic electronics, which can be used in future organic electronics and microelectronics. (3) Bifunctional or even multifunctional molecules are recommended. Modern electronics need an integration of various functions. If one molecule can be used for different purposes such as light-emitting applications and data storage, the fabrication cost can be reduced since the integration can be based on one molecule. (4) Machine learning can be used to analyze our experimental results and help design high-performance five-ring-fused organic semiconductors.

 	Fig. 53  The statistical results of five-ring-fused organic molecules with mobilities higher than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1. (a) Small molecules and polymers. (b) Fused aromatic, aromatic and non-aromatic, and non-aromatic rings. (c) Linear and angular structures. (d) The morphologies of both single crystals and thin films, pure single crystals and pure thin films. (e) Electronic properties of p-type hole, ambipolar, and n-type electron transport. (f) Four molecular packing ways – herringbone, cofacial herringbone, 1D slipped-stack and 2D bricklayer.
