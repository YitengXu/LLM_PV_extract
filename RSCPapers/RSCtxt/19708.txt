    , Accepted 22nd January 2012First published on 15th March 2012AbstractA new series of A2B2 type porphyrins, i.e. free base P1 and Zn-complex P2, have been synthesized and characterized as photosensitizers for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). These dye molecules contain a porphyrin unit as a π-spacer, two N,N′-dimethylphenyl groups as electron donors and two phenylcarboxylic acid moieties as anchoring groups yielding push push–pull pull type porphyrins. The photophysical as well as electrochemical properties of the two dyes (P1 and P2) were investigated by UV-Vis, fluorescence spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The DFT results showed that the HOMO is located on the donor group and the LUMO is located on the anchoring carboxylate group indicating their suitability for fabrication in DSSCs. Under photovoltaic measurements, overall PCEs of 3.80% and 4.90% were achieved with the DSSCs based on P1 and P2 dyes, respectively. The overall PCEs have been further improved up to 4.83% and 6.07%, with P1 and P2 dyes when CDCA co-adsorbent was added to the dye solution. The electrochemical impedance data indicate that the electron lifetime was improved by the coadsorption of CDCA, which was attributed to the improvement in both Voc and Jsc. The increase in Jsc has also been attributed to the reduction of the back reaction, i.e. the recombination of electrons with tri-iodide ions.
Introduction
Over the past few years, there has been considerable attention paid to photoactive molecules to convert solar energy into electrical energy. In this regard, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO2 films have attracted significant attention due to their low cost and high power conversion efficiencies.1 In these solar cells, the process of light absorption and charge separation is performed by a sensitizer attached to a large band gap semiconductor which takes care of charge transport.2 Organic or inorganic dye sensitizers have been found to be one of the most important tools for DSSCs to obtain high power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this way several research groups have been devoted to explore the efficient dyes to improve the PCE of the DSSCs. Most commonly, polypyridine ruthenium complexes such as N3,1a,3 N719,1a,4 black dye5 and Z9076 show overall PCEs reaching up to 11% under 100 mW cm−2 illumination of simulated solar light. In recent years, the interest in organic dyes as substitutes for noble metal complexes has increased due to their many advantages such as diversity of molecular structure, high molar extinction coefficients, simple synthesis as well as low cost and environmental issues.7
Porphyrins are one of the most widely studied sensitizers for DSSCs, because of their strong Soret (400–450 nm) and moderate Q bands (550–650 nm).8 The porphyrin based dyes have several intrinsic advantages such as good photostability and rigid molecular structure with large absorption coefficients in the visible region. In addition, four meso and eight β positions of porphyrins are available for functionalization which led to fine tuning of their optical, physical and electrochemical properties and thus become feasible for DSSCs.9,10 Along this effort, Officer and coworkers developed several DSSCs based on porphyrin dyes that exhibited overall PCE up to 7.1%.11 However, the overall performance of porphyrin dyes in DSSCs remains below that of Ru(II) based sensitizers.1d,12 It is therefore important to design and synthesize novel porphyrin derivatives so as to modulate their fundamental molecular orbital (MO) and light absorption properties to improve the overall PCE of DSSCs. Recently, Kim et al. have reported the photovoltaic activities of various β-functionalized porphyrin dimer dyes.13 This work was motivated by the consideration that functionalization of porphyrins at the pyrrolic β-position with π-conjugative linkers could represent a possible strategy for the preparation of more efficient DSSCs. The resulting extension of the π-conjugation framework along with anchoring substituent (e.g. carboxylic acid) allows more effective injection of electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 which acts as a photoelectrode. On this basis, the use of porphyrin containing both conjugated anchoring carboxyl groups and a donor group attached at a meso position was expected to give rise to highly effective DSSCs. In fact, very recently, Gratzel et al. reported that push–pull type porphyrin dyes (YD2 and YD2-o-C8) with diarylamine and ethynylbenzoic acid substituents at meso positions have achieved a PCE of 11% and 12.3% respectively, which is the highest value recorded for porphyrin based DSSCs so far.14 Along the same line, Lin et al. reported a PCE of 10.06% and 10.17% for a DSSC based on zinc porphyrin bearing an ethynyl-dimethylaniline moiety as a donor and an ethynyl-phenylcarboxy group as an acceptor group.15 Therefore, rational design of efficient porphyrin dyes having good light harvesting abilities in visible and near IR regions is important to get a large photocurrent response. Appropriate donor–acceptor groups on the porphyrin ring can significantly broaden the Soret band as well as Q bands which lead to its enhanced light absorbing property as well as photovoltaic efficiency.
In this contribution, we report the synthesis and characterization of two meso-substituted A2B2 type porphyrins, the free base (P1) and the corresponding Zn-complex (P2). The two N,N′-dimethylphenyl groups act as donors and two phenylcarboxylic acid groups as acceptors in the meso-substituted porphyrins (P1 and P2). The electrochemical analysis of both P1 and P2 indicates that the HOMO and LUMO levels are suitable for sensitizers used for DSSCs. The overall PCE of the DSSCs based on P1 and P2 is 3.80% and 4.90%, respectively. The higher PCE for the P2 based DSSC has been attributed to the higher amount of dye adsorption onto the TiO2 and the electron lifetime than that for the P1 based DSSC. The PCE further improved up to 4.83% and 6.07% for P1 and P2, respectively, when CDCA was incorporated into the dye solution.
Experimental details
General procedures
All manipulations were carried out using standard Schlenk techniques wherever required. All the solvents were purified and dried by standard procedures. 5-(4-Carbomethoxyphenyl) dipyrromethane was prepared by reaction between pyrrole and 4-formybenzoate in the presence of InCl3 catalyst (ratio of pyrrole:aldehyde:InCl3 = 100:1:0.1) following the crystallization method reported by Lindsey et al.161H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were recorded (CDCl3 or DMSO-D6) on Bruker DPX-300 MHz and Bruker AMX-500 MHz NMR spectrometers using the solvent peak as an internal standard. 1H NMR peaks are labeled as singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t) and multiplet (m). High resolution mass spectra were recorded in a Bruker UltrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF spectrometer. UV-Vis absorption spectra of compounds were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1700 Phermaspec spectrophotometer using 10 mm path-length cuvettes. The emission spectra were measured on a JASCO FP-6500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a red-sensitive WRE-343 photomultiplier tube (wavelength range: 200–850 nm). Quantum yields were determined from corrected emission spectra following the standard methods using Zn(TPP) (Φ = 0.033 in toluene) as a standard. Emission lifetimes were determined by the time correlated single photon counting technique using an Edinburgh Instruments mini-tau lifetime spectrophotometer equipped with an EPL 405 pulsed diode laser at 406.0 nm with a pulse width of 71.52 ps and a pulse period of 200 ns, and a high speed red-sensitive photomultiplier tube (H5773-04) as a detector. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out in a CH electrochemical analyzer instrument using three electrodes.

Computational methods
DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09W17 (Revision-A.02) program suite and employing default optimization conditions for tight SCF convergence criteria. The geometry of the dye was optimized in the gas phase using density functional theory (DFT)18 using the hybrid B3LYP19 density functional and the 6-31G* basis set. For the zinc porphyrin, computations were also performed with the B3LYP functional using the 6-31G* basis set for lighter atoms and LANL2DZ for the Zn atom. The optimized structure was subjected to vibrational analysis and characterized as a minimum due to the absence of imaginary frequency. The time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT)20 computations at the same level (B3LYP/6-31G*) were further carried out to determine first 10 vertical excitations to the excited state of the molecule. The TDDFT result of P2 obtained using a common basis set (6-31G*) was more satisfactory than using split basis sets i.e. 6-31G* for lighter atoms and LANL2DZ for Zn (Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†) and hence discussed here. Similar observations of TDDFT calculation for Zn-porphyrins have been reported earlier by Kowalski et al.21 The computations in DMF were performed by applying the polarizable continuum model (PCM) using the integral equation formalism variant (IEFPCM) to describe the electrostatic solute–solvent interactions by the creation of solute cavity via a set of overlapping spheres.22 The absorption spectra were simulated by using the 10 lowest spin-allowed singlet transitions, the mixed Lorentzian–Gaussian lineshape (0.5) and an average full-width at half maximum of 3000 cm−1 for all peaks.23
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were carried out using Autolab Electrochemical Instruments, employing a glassy carbon working electrode, saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE), and Pt wire counter-electrode, and ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) ion as an internal standard. All measurements were carried out at room temperature in degassed THF containing 0.1 M of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as a supporting electrolyte. The scan rate was 100 mV s−1. All reported waves are reversible. Potentials are reported vs. SCE and referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple (Table S2, ESI†).
Fabrication on DSSC and characterization
The TiO2 paste was prepared by mixing 1 g of TiO2 power (P25 Degussa), 0.2 mL of acetic acid and 1 mL of water. Then 60 mL of ethanol was slowly added while sonicating the mixture for 3 h. Finally, Triton X-100 was added to obtain a dispersed colloidal (TiO2) paste and then stirred for 4 h at 80 °C to form a transparent colloidal (TiO2) paste. The TiO2 paste was deposited on the pre-cleaned fluorine (F) doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate by the doctor blade technique. Two edges of the FTO glass plate were covered with four layers of adhesive tape to control the thickness and to mask the electric strips; successively the TiO2 paste was spread uniformly on the substrate by sliding a glass rod along the tape spacer. The resulting TiO2 film was estimated to be around 15 μm thick. The TiO2 coated FTO films were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the electrodes were impregnated in 0.05 M titanium tetrachloride aqueous solution, washed with distilled water and again sintered at 450 °C for 30 min followed by cooling to room temperature. The TiO2 electrodes were immersed in DMF containing 1 mM porphyrin dyes for 12 h to prepare the porphyrin sensitized TiO2 electrodes. The Pt counter-electrodes were prepared by spin casting drops of H2PtCl6 solution on FTO glass and heating at 350 °C for 15 min. To prevent a short circuit, two electrodes were assembled into a cell of sandwich type with a spacer of 20 μm thickness. One drop of electrolyte solution (LiI (0.05 M), I2 (0.5 M), dimethyl-propyl-benzimidiazole iodide (DPMII) (0.6 M), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) (0.5 M) in acetonitrile solution) was deposited onto the surface of the dye sensitized TiO2 electrode and penetrated inside TiO2via capillary action. The Pt coated FTO electrode was then clipped onto the top of TiO2 working electrode to form the complete DSSC.
The current–voltage characteristics (J–V) of the devices in the dark, and under illumination, were measured by a semiconductor parameter analyser (Keithley 4200-SCS). A xenon light source (Oriel, USA) was used to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 (equivalent of one sun at AM 1.5) at the surface of the device. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were carried out by applying bias equivalent to the Voc of the device and recorded over a frequency of 1 mHz to 105 Hz with an ac amplitude of 10 mV. The above measurements were recorded with an electrochemical impedance analyser equipped with FRA.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterizations
The synthesis of the porphyrin free base P1 and Zn porphyrin P2 is depicted in Scheme 1. The key intermediate porphyrin 1 was prepared by the TFA catalyzed condensation of 5-(4-carbomethoxyphenyl)dipyrromethane with 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde following a modified procedure. The typical Lindsey procedure (using dipyrromethane:TFA = 1:0.1) for sterically hindered dipyrromethane was not successful probably because of the poor reactivity of 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde. In addition, protonation of the dimethylamino group may consume some portion of the TFA and thus reduce its efficiency to catalyze the condensation. Employing the reaction conditions (using dipyrromethane:TFA = 1:4) for the synthesis of A2B2 porphyrin bearing basic nitrogens reported by Gryko et al.24 did not progress well (as observed by TLC) in the mentioned period (30 min) of stirring. However, a longer reaction time under similar conditions leads to a satisfactory yield (10%) of the desired A2B2 porphyrin (1) along with the formation of corrole and a little amount of scrambled products. Porphyrin 1 was purified by silica gel column chromatography using dichloromethane:ethylacetate (95:5) as an eluent and subsequently characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Hydrolysis under basic conditions of 1 with KOH followed by acidification produced the free base porphyrin P1 in 82% yield. Metallation of 1 by Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O in the chloroform–methanol mixture resulted 2 in 68% yield after chromatographic purification. Hydrolysis of 2 followed by careful acidification yielded the target Zn porphyrin P2 in 70% yield. All the compounds were characterized by NMR, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The formation of P1 was confirmed by the appearance of the –COOH proton at 13.3 ppm and the pyrrolic NH proton of the porphyrin ring at −2.83 ppm in 1H NMR spectra. Consistent with the metallation, the pyrrolic NH peak disappeared for P2 while the COOH protons were observed at 13.2 ppm. 13C NMR spectra of P2 in DMSO-d6 showed a characteristic –COOH peak at 167.6 ppm and –N(CH3)2 at 40.2 ppm. Because of the insufficient solubility of porphyrins in common solvents, we could not get satisfactory 13C NMR for compounds 1, P1 and 2.

Photophysical studies
The porphyrin dyes P1 and P2 exhibit typical porphyrin absorption characteristics as shown in Fig. 1.25 The absorption spectra of porphyrin free base P1 and Zn porphyrin P2 in DMF solution contain an intense absorbing broad band at 422 nm and red shifted 432 nm respectively, that correspond to the porphyrin Soret band. The four peaks observed at 520, 561, 596 and 654 nm correspond to the Q peaks of the porphyrin free base P1. The Q bands of the Zn porphyrin P2 were observed at 562 and 607 nm. The broad, red shifted Soret bands as well as Q bands indicate the improved light harvesting behavior of P2 as its structural deviation from planarity arises out of sterically hindered donor–acceptor groups at meso-positions. In addition, axial coordination of DMF to the Zn metal may also lead to the non-planarity of P2. Fig. 2b shows the simulated absorption spectra (TDDFT) of these porphyrin dyes in DMF. Both the gas phase and DMF phase TDDFT spectra of P1 and P2 dyes closely match with the experimental spectra, however, slight blue shifts (10–20 nm) of the absorption peaks were observed in the case of simulated TDDFT transitions.

 Fig. 2  Simulated (fwhm = 25 nm) absorption spectra of the dyes P1 and P2 in the (a) gas phase and (b) dimethylformamide (DMF). 
The fluorescence emission of P1 and P2 was performed at both room temperature (Fig. 3a) as well as 77 K (Fig. 3b). The room temperature emission profile of P1 in DMF showed a band at 680 nm when excited at 520 nm, while the Zn porphyrin P2 exhibits a broad emission band at 630 nm along with a shoulder at 670 nm when excited at 560 nm (Table 1). The zinc complex P2 was found to have better emissive properties compared to the free base that is evident from the fluorescence profile (Fig. 3). The quantum yields (Φ) of P1 and P2 were determined using tetra-phenylporphyrin (TPP) and Zn-TPP as reference compound respectively (Table 1). Interestingly, the higher fluorescence quantum yields of Zn porphyrin P2 (0.084) compared to its free base P1 (0.049) validate the better emissive efficiency of the former one which could be explained as its “intrinsic property”. A similar observation of higher quantum yield for Zn-porphyrin compared to its free base has been reported earlier.26

The absorption spectra of P1 and P2 dyes were also measured on TiO2 films and are shown in Fig. 4. In order to avoid the saturation of the Soret band absorption, only small amounts of porphyrins are allowed to adsorb onto the TiO2 films (i.e. porphyrin dyes were partially loaded). In addition, the absorption spectra were normalized to make a comparison between two conditions. These results indicate that the Soret and Q-bands of porphyrin/TiO2 films were only slightly red shifted but considerably broadened relative to the solution spectra. The broadened absorption bands in TiO2 adsorbed films might reflect intermolecular interactions of molecules aggregated on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles in accordance with reported results.27 Moreover, the broadened absorption bands observed in the porphyrin dye adsorbed TiO2 film spectra minimize the gap between the Soret and Q bands, resulting in increased spectral responses of the solar cells.

DFT and TDDFT results
In order to obtain further insight into the nature of the electronic transitions of the dyes P1 and P2, TDDFT calculations were carried out in both the gas phase and DMF. The computed positions of the vertical excitations, their oscillator strengths, MO compositions of vertical transitions and orbital energies are listed in Tables 2 and 3 while, the theoretical HOMO–LUMO gaps are listed in Table 4. The electron density maps of the major molecular orbital (MO) contributors are presented in Fig. 5a and b. In this regard, it is important to mention that the complex spectral behavior of the un-substituted porphyrins (e.g., tetraphenyl porphyrin, TPP) can be well explained by Gouterman's “four orbital model”28 which says that major electronic peaks of porphyrins (B and Q bands) involve contributions primarily from four frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs): HOMO, HOMO − 1, LUMO and LUMO + 1. However, deviation from the Gouterman's behavior was observed when conjugated substituents are incorporated into porphyrins.29 The present porphyrins P1 and P2, containing conjugated donor (–NMe2) and acceptor (–COOH) groups, exhibit the deviation from Gouterman behavior as observed from the TDDFT output. Quite expected, the HOMOs of both P1 and P2 are mainly delocalized over the porphyrin ring and extended to donor –NMe2 groups while the LUMO electron densities are delocalized on the porphyrin ring as well as on the anchoring –COOH moiety.

(b) Electronic distributions observed for the dye P2 in selected frontier molecular orbitals contributing significantly to the electronic transitions. 
The solvent phase (DMF) TDDFT spectra more closely match with the experimental observation compared to that of the gas phase TDDFT calculation (Fig. 1, 2a and b). The DMF phase calculation of P1 showed two closely spaced intense peaks at 398 and 410 nm involving major contributions from HOMO − 3 → LUMO + 1, HOMO − 2 → LUMO, HOMO → LUMO + 3 and HOMO − 2 → LUMO + 1 (Table 2) respectively, which could be assigned as a porphyrin based Soret band. The same transition was observed for P2 at ∼391 and 409 nm involving major contributions from HOMO − 3 → LUMO + 1, HOMO − 2 → LUMO, and HOMO → LUMO + 3 (Table 3) and could be assigned as porphyrin based π → π* transitions of the Soret band. The calculated Q bands of the porphyrin P1 were observed at ∼596 and 628 nm which arise out of electronic transitions from HOMO → LUMO + 1 and HOMO → LUMO, while the Q bands of P2 were observed at ∼571 and 586 nm which correspond to HOMO → LUMO + 1 and HOMO → LUMO transitions respectively. It can be seen from these tables that the oscillator strength is higher in the Soret band as compared to the Q-band in both dyes, which is in agreement with that reported in the literature for porphyrin dyes.30 The appearance of an additional middle band at ∼488 (P1) and ∼480 (P2) having major contribution from HOMO → LUMO and HOMO − 3 → LUMO + 1, however, was not observed experimentally.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the two porphyrins, P1 and P2, were investigated by cyclic and square wave voltammetry in THF. The redox data are collected in Table S2†, and representative cyclic voltammograms are depicted in Fig. S2†. All data are reported vs. SCE. Cyclic voltammetry data show a reversible process occurring at 0.86 V for P1 and at 0.85 V for P2 due to the first porphyrin based oxidation. The reduction waves are observed at −1.21 V for P1 and −1.44 V for P2 respectively (Fig. S2 and Table S2, ESI†). To ensure efficient electron injection from the LUMO of the sensitizer into the conduction band of TiO2, the LUMO level must be higher than the conduction band edge of TiO2. The HOMO level of the sensitizer must be lower than the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple for efficient regeneration of the sensitizer cations after the photo-induced electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2. The oxidation potentials of the dyes are more positive than that of the I−/I3− couple (0.4 V vs. NHE).31 This means that once oxidized, the porphyrins P1 and P2 are thermodynamically capable of accepting an electron from this key transfer material and ensure the regeneration of sensitizer radical cations by the electrolyte redox couple (Fig. 6). The reduction potentials of dyes P1 and P2 are more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE),31 therefore electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2 nanoparticles is thermodynamically favoured (ΔGinj < 0) following porphyrin photoexcitation.32 The dual ability, namely, to transfer an electron from the porphyrin excited singlet state into the CB of the TiO2 to produce a porphyrin radical cation and then reduce this latter species via electron capture from the I−/I3− redox mediator, makes these porphyrin dyes of interest for DSSCs in the present study (Fig. 6).

Photovoltaic properties
In dye sensitized solar cells, the method of preparation of TiO2 plays an important role in the performance of the device. We have used a double layer TiO2 film and 20 nm and 200 nm TiO2 particles as the photoanode to improve the light harvesting ability. In addition, the performances of porphyrin dye sensitized TiO2 solar cells are strongly affected by the solvents, immersing time and illumination time. To optimize the condition of dye baths for porphyrin sensitizers of DSSCs, we have measured the performance of the DSSCs sensitized with porphyrin dye from different baths i.e. DMF, C2H5OH and CHCl3 and found the best performance with DMF solution, which can be attributed to the higher dye density on the TiO2 surface.
The performance of the dye sensitized solar cells was investigated by current–voltage (J–V) measurements under an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 7 shows the J–V curve for DSSCs based on these porphyrin dyes. The photovoltaic parameters i.e. short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the DSSCs are summarized in Table 5. The DSSC based on P1 dye gave a Jsc of 9.9 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.62 V and a FF of 0.62, corresponding to an overall PCE of 3.80%. The P2 sensitized solar cell gave a Jsc of 11.1 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.66 V and a FF of 0.66, corresponding to an overall PCE of 4.83%. The different PCE values of two porphyrin sensitized solar cells primarily result from the difference between the Jsc and FF.

J–V characteristics of DSSCs sensitized with (a) P1 and P2 porphyrin dyes and (b) CDCA coadsorbents P1 and P2. 
The strength of intermolecular interaction of porphyrin dyes, which may influence the solar cell performance, can be evaluated by means of the adsorbed dye amount onto the TiO2 surface. The total number of dye adsorbed onto the TiO2 film was determined by the absorbance of dye, which was dissolved from the dye coated TiO2 film into DMF/H2O (4:1) with 0.1 mol L−1 NaOH. The surface density value (dye adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface) of P1 and P2 is 0.89 × 10−8 mol cm−3 and 1.6 × 10−8 mol cm−3, respectively. This indicates that the Zn complex porphyrin dye has stronger intermolecular interaction than that with free-base porphyrin dye. Since the amount of dye adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface is an important factor to determine the photocurrent generation, the low value of Jsc of the P1 sensitized solar cell compared to the P2 sensitized solar cell mainly results from the lower amount of dye adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface which may be due to its weak electronic coupling with the nano-porous TiO2 surface. The higher uptake for P2 may be rationalized by resonance conjugation between Zn and carboxylic groups, increasing the basicity of P2 and hence affinity of TiO2. The lower PCE of DSSCs based on these dyes in comparison to the N3 dye may be due to the fact that the porphyrin dyes have a tendency to undergo aggregation due to their almost planar structure. In this regard, it is important to mention that the present porphyrin system (P1 and P2) has improved photovoltaic efficiency compared to our recently reported meso-carboxyphenyl Zn-porphyrin which exhibited efficiency up to 4.22% in the presence of deoxycholic acid as co-adsorbent.33 It is worth mentioning about tetra-carboxyphenyl Zn-porphyrin (Zn-TCPP) reported by Cherian and Wamser that exhibited 3.5% PCE under standard conditions8c while more recently, Imahori et al. reported a series of Zn-porphyrins with meso-carboxyphenyl that displayed 6.5% efficiency in the presence of CDCA co-adsorbent.9f
The interfacial charge transfer in DSSCs can be investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).34 The EIS spectra i.e. Nyquist and Bode phase plots were measured in the dark under a forward bias of 0.65 V and are shown in Fig. 8. Nyquist plots have three semicircles and the middle semicircle indicates charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The radius of the middle circles indicates the charge recombination resistance. As can be seen from Fig. 8 that the radius of the Nyquist plots is in the order of P2 > P1 indicating that the recombination rate is increased in the order P1 > P2 in the dark.35 The middle frequency peak in the Bode phase plots also corresponds to charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The DSSC based on P2 showed a lower frequency peak than that based on P1 indicating a longer electron lifetime.34 The value of electron lifetime for DSSCs based on P1 and P2 is 9.8 ms and 15.2 ms respectively. The ranking of electron lifetimes observed in EIS coincided with that of Voc values, i.e.P2 with high Voc had a longer electron lifetime than P1. In order to gain more insight into the electron transport in the DSSCs based on these porphyrin dyes, the EIS of DSSCs were also measured under illumination. As shown in Fig. 9, the radius of the semicircle in the intermediate frequency regime, according to the Nyquist plot, is in the order of P1 > P2. These results indicate that the charge transport is in the order of P2 > P1, which coincides with the PCE of the DSSCs.

 Fig. 9  Nyquist plots of DSSCs based on P1 and P2 without CDCA coadsorbent measured at −0.65 V forward bias under illumination. 
The addition of coadsorbents such as chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), during the sensitizer adsorption step, to reduce the molecular aggregation on the surface of TiO2 resulted in a considerable improvement in the PCE of DSSCs. The J–V characteristics of the DSSCs with CDCA-coadsorbent porphyrin dyes are also shown in Fig. 7b. The photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 5. The DSSCs fabricated with CDCA coadsorbent in the porphyrin dye showed improved performance i.e. PCE is 4.90% and 6.07% for CDCA–P1 and CDCA–P2, respectively. The values of Jsc and Voc were higher in the DSSCs fabricated with 10 mM of CDCA than those without CDCA. This could be due to the increased competition between the dye and the CDCA molecules for adsorption onto the TiO2 surface.
Improvements of Voc are generally related to negative shifts of the conduction band edge or suppression of charge recombination.36 CDCA molecules were adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface as chenodexycholate anions, hence the TiO2 surface was negatively charged. Therefore, the conduction band of the TiO2 should be negatively shifted by the coadsorption of CDCA, increasing Voc. The coadsorption of CDCA can also suppress charge recombination between injected electrons and I3− ions in the electrolyte, improving Voc.37
We have also measured the EIS of the DSSCs based on CDCA coadsorbent porphyrin dyes and estimated the electron lifetime from the Bode phase plot. The value of electron lifetime for P1 and P2 is 14.5 ms and 19.2 ms, respectively. The radius of semicircle of the Nyquist plot under illumination in the intermediate frequency regime is reduced, which indicates that the electron transport is improved in the DSSCs with the incorporation of CDCA in the dye solution.
Conclusions
We have synthesized two new porphyrin dyes i.e. free base P1 and zinc complex P2, possessing an overall donor–porphyrin–acceptor structure. The photophysical properties of the two dyes (P1 and P2) were investigated by UV-Vis, fluorescence spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry studies. These dyes contain two electron donating units and two electron accepting units. The –COOH units act as anchoring units for attaching the porphyrin core to the TiO2 surface. The DFT calculations also showed their suitability for fabrication in DSSCs. The overall PCE of DSSCs based on the P1 and P2 is 3.80% and 4.90%, respectively. The higher PCE of P2 than that of P1 has been attributed to the longer electron lifetime and higher amount of dye adsorption onto the TiO2 surface. The PCE was found to improve up to 4.83% (P1) and 6.07% (P2) when CDCA was incorporated in the dye solution. The results reported here gave us a good direction towards optimization of the donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) structure of the porphyrin dyes as well as the morphology of nanostructured TiO2 for improved and efficient DSSCs. Works along this aim are in progress and could be an interest of our future work.
