At high temperature, the tertiary alkyl ester groups of the three compounds undergo thermo-cleavage processes to produce insoluble methano[60]fullerene-61-carboxylic acids (MCAs). BMHMD and bis-DBMD were applied in inverted polymer solar cells as a cathode buffer layer. Heating BMHMD or bis-DBMD films on ZnO produced MCA1 and MCA2 interfacial layers, respectively. MCA-modified ZnO possesses a smoother and more hydrophobic surface, and shows excellent solvent-resistance. The MCA buffer layer dramatically improved the device performance by enhancing Jsc and FF of the solar cells. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased from 3.44% (control) to 3.79% (MCA1) and 4.10% (MCA2) for a P3HT/PC61BM solar cell, and from 6.95% (control) to 7.13% (MCA1) and 7.57% (MCA2) for a PBDTTT-C/PC71BM solar cell.
Introduction
Cheap production of electricity from solar energy is one of the top challenges today. For this reason, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising technology for solar energy harvesting due to their low cost, light weight, and mechanical flexibility for large-area roll-to-roll fabrication.1 A conventional bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSC generally consists of a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) anode, a hole-collecting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) buffer layer, a photoactive layer containing a conjugated polymer donor (e.g. P3HT) and a fullerene acceptor (e.g. PCBM), and a low work-function metal cathode (e.g. Al). Nowadays, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for tandem PSCs has surpassed 10%, which is approaching the threshold (∼15% PCE) for commercialization.2 The rapid advancement of PCE benefits from the development of high-performance materials, novel device structure and interface engineering technologies.3–5 Apart from PCE, the device stability is a challenging issue. The poor stability of conventional PSCs is caused by easy oxidation of the low work-function metal cathode and etching of ITO by acidic PEDOT:PSS.6,7 To solve these problems, making PSCs with an inverted structure has been demonstrated to be an effective approach. The inverted PSCs employ an air-stable high work-function metal (e.g. Ag) as anode and an electron-transporting metal oxide (e.g. TiO2, ZnO)-coated ITO as cathode.8 As a result, significantly improved ambient stability and long lifetime can be realized.9
ZnO is one of the most widely used electron transporting materials for inverted PSCs due to its high transparency in visible and NIR regions, good electron mobility, and solution processability.10 However, the relatively large energy offset between the conduction band of ZnO and the LUMO of an acceptor, the poor compatibility between ZnO and organic compounds, as well as the electron traps on a metal oxide surface, might limit the overall performance of devices.11 Therefore, many studies have focused on the development of new interfacial materials between ZnO and the active layer to overcome the shortcomings of ZnO.12–14 Among all the interfacial materials, fullerene-based interfacial materials (FIMs) have shown inherent advantages such as their tunable energy levels, good electron mobility, and good compatibility with the active layer.15 Two types of FIMs have been successfully applied in inverted PSCs. One is the fullerenes functionalized with an anchoring group such as carboxylic acid or phosphonic acid that can form a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on ZnO, and the other is cross-linkable fullerene materials which can form a robust and solvent resistant thin film on ZnO on heating or UV irradiation.13,14 Though these FIMs can remarkably improve the performance of inverted PSCs, there are still deficiencies for these materials. For SAM fullerenes, the drawbacks include the relatively complicated fabrication conditions for forming a monolayer, the insufficient coverage of a SAM on ZnO, and the possible desorption of a SAM during the wetting process.16 For cross-linkable fullerenes, tedious syntheses are required due to their relatively complex molecular structures.14 In this work, we designed a new class of FIMs for inverted PSCs, which circumvents their drawbacks. Three thermo-cleavable fullerene derivatives, di-tert-butyl methano[60]fullerene-61,61-dicarboxylate (DBMD), bis(2-methylhexan-2-yl) methano[60]fullerene-61,61-dicarboxylate (BMHMD), and di-tert-butyl methano[60]fullerene-61,61-dicarboxylate bis-adducts (bis-DBMD), were prepared through a one-step synthesis from C60 (Fig. 1). The highly soluble BMHMD and bis-DBMD can form nice films on ZnO by spin-coating and work as precursors for the real FIMs, methano[60]fullerene-61-carboxylic acid (MCA). At high temperature, the tertiary alkyl ester groups of BMHMD and bis-DBMD can be cleaved and the new fullerene species MCA with carboxylic acid anchoring groups can be generated in situ. Due to the chemical bonding between MCA and ZnO and the poor solubility of MCA in organic solvents, the MCA buffer layer can withstand the next solution processing (Scheme 1). The inverted PSCs using thermo-cleavable FIMs demonstrated superior performance.

Results and discussion
The thermo-cleavable fullerenes were synthesized by a Bingel reaction from C60. Treating C60 with 1 equivalent of di-tert-butyl 2-bromomalonate in the presence of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) afforded DBMD in 63% yield.17 Similarly, by using 1 equivalent of bis(2-methylhexan-2-yl) 2-bromomalonate or 2 equivalents of di-tert-butyl 2-bromomalonate, BMHMD or bis-DBMD could be obtained in 45% or 26% yields, respectively. All reactions proceeded smoothly at room temperature. DBMD, bis-DBMD, and BMHMD were then thoroughly characterized by spectroscopic methods (see ESI†). The thermo-cleavage behavior of these fullerenes was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 2). DBMD exhibits a degradation onset at 170 °C in N2. The first-stage weight loss is about 16%, which is identical to the theoretical weight loss of two isobutenes and one carbon dioxide. This result suggests that DBMD underwent decomposition at 170 °C and generated a fullerene carboxylic acid, MCA1 (Fig. 2a).18 The generation of MCA1 was further confirmed by characterization of the decomposition product of DBMD. After being heated at 180 °C for 10 min, the IR spectrum for DBMD (Fig. S6a†) shows a broad peak (2700–3300 cm−1) and a sharp peak (1420 cm−1), which can be attributed to the characteristic stretching vibration and bending vibration of a carboxylic acid group, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum of MCA1 (Fig. S4†) shows a singlet peak at 4.91 ppm and a broad peak at 10.60 ppm, corresponding to the characteristic signals of the methine proton and the carboxylic acid proton.19 Compared with DBMD, BMHMD shows a lower degradation onset at 140 °C. The first-stage weight loss is about 24%, suggesting the loss of two alkyl groups and one carbon dioxide and the generation of MCA1 (Fig. 2b), which was also confirmed by IR and NMR. The first-stage weight loss for bis-DBMD is about 23%, corresponding to the loss of four isobutenes and one carbon dioxide. MCA2, a fullerene with three carboxylic acid groups, was generated through this process (Fig. 2c). MCA2 is a mixture of regioisomers as indicated by its 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S5†).

Different from DBMD, both BMHMD and bis-DBMD show good film-forming capability. As shown in Scheme 1, a solution of BMHMD or bis-DBMD in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) (4 mg mL−1) was first spin-coated onto an ITO/ZnO surface. BMHMD and bis-DBMD films were heated at 160 °C and 180 °C for 10 min to provide MCA1 and MCA2 films, respectively. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3) and contact angle measurements show that from the ITO/ZnO surface to the ITO/ZnO/MCA1 or ITO/ZnO/MCA2 surface, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness decreased from 0.96 nm to 0.48 nm or 0.59 nm, respectively, and the water contact angle increased from 32° to 72° or 61°, respectively, indicating that MCA-modified ZnO possesses a smoother and more hydrophobic surface than ZnO. The smaller contact angle of the MCA2 surface compared with that of the MCA1 surface consists with the fact that MCA2 possesses more hydrophilic carboxylic acid groups than MCA1. The contact angle change from the precursor film surface to the MCA surface, i.e. from 80° (BMHMD) to 72° (MCA1) and from 86° (bis-DBMD) to 61° (MCA2), reflects the thermo-cleavage process on the surface. After spin-rinsing with ODCB, UV-Vis absorption spectra for MCA1 and MCA2 films showed no change, indicating the solvent resistance of these films (Fig. 4). In sharp contrast, the precursor BMHMD and bis-DBMD films can be completely rinsed away with ODCB. The outstanding solvent resistance property of MCAs originates from the chemical bonding between the carboxylic acid group and the ZnO surface and their extremely low solubility in ODCB. The solubility for MCA1 in ODCB is about 0.1 mg mL−1, which is several hundred times lower than that of soluble fullerenes, such as PC61BM. The solubility for MCA2 in ODCB is much lower, below 0.01 mg mL−1.

LUMO energy levels of MCAs, −3.71 eV for MCA1 and −3.62 eV for MCA2, estimated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of their precursors (BMHMD and bis-DBMD) are close to PC61BM LUMO (−3.67 eV), indicating that MCAs are suitable for electron accepting and transporting (Fig. S7 and Table S1†).20 Typical P3HT/PC61BM (Fig. 5) solar cells with an inverted structure, ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PC61BM (1:1, w/w)/MoO3/Ag (device A), ITO/ZnO/MCA1/P3HT:PC61BM (1:1, w/w)/MoO3/Ag (device B), and ITO/ZnO/MCA2/P3HT:PC61BM (1:1, w/w)/MoO3/Ag (device C), were fabricated to evaluate the effects of MCAs on the device performance. The detailed procedures for fabrication of devices B and C are depicted in Scheme 1 and the Experimental section. The optimized thicknesses for MCA interlayers were about 3 nm. J–V curves for devices A, B, and C are shown in Fig. 6a and the device performance parameters are listed in Table 1. Under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2), the reference device A afforded a PCE of 3.44%, with a Voc of 0.58 V, a Jsc of 11.3 mA cm−2, and a FF of 53%, while device B with MCA1 afforded an increased PCE of 3.79%, with a Voc of 0.59 V, a Jsc of 11.6 mA cm−2, and a FF of 55%, and device C with MCA2 afforded an enhanced PCE of 4.10%, with a Voc of 0.59 V, a Jsc of 12.4 mA cm−2, and a FF of 56%. The PCE enhancement of devices B and C with MCAs benefits from higher Jsc and FF. As fullerene derivatives, MCAs act as better acceptors than ZnO and provide extra D/A interfaces for exciton dissociation, thus enhancing Jsc.21 Compared with the ZnO surface, MCAs' surface favors the wetting of P3HT/PC61BM blend solution due to their increased hydrophobicity. The smoother MCA-modified ZnO surface favors active layer coating, enhances electrical coupling, lowers contact resistance, and eventually improves Jsc and FF. The series resistances (Rs) of devices B and C are 8.8 Ω cm2 and 7.3 Ω cm2, respectively, which are smaller than that of device A, 11.5 Ω cm2. To determine whether some unexpectedly dissolved MCA in the active layer enhances the device performance, we fabricated a P3HT/PC61BM solar cell with some MCA1 added into the blend solution (content 0.1 mg mL−1). Compared with device A, this cell gave a PCE of 1.78%, with decreased Voc, Jsc and FF (see Fig. S8†), suggesting that a little MCA permeating into the active layer during the spin-coating process does not improve the device performance. This experiment indicates that the above inference on the MCA buffer layer's function is reasonable.

To figure out whether MCA buffer layers could affect the morphology of the upper active layer, we investigated the morphological difference between the active layers on ZnO and those on ZnO/MCA1 or ZnO/MCA2 by AFM (Fig. S9†). The height images for P3HT/PC61BM blend films on ZnO, ZnO/MCA1, and ZnO/MCA2 show RMS roughnesses of 3.90 nm, 3.46 nm, and 4.86 nm, respectively, while the phase images for these films are quite similar. The rougher films on the ZnO/MCA2 surface suggest possible stronger interaction between MCA2 and P3HT/PC61BM blend films. Since the ZnO/MCA2 surface possesses more carboxylic acid groups, H-bonding between carboxylic acid groups of MCA2 and ester groups of PC61BM could perturb the phase separation in the P3HT/PC61BM blend from the beginning of the coating process and eventually lead to a morphological difference in the upper active layer. Such a selective interaction between MCA2 and PC61BM might account for better performance of device C, because it may induce a vertical content gradient, with PC61BM enriched at the bottom and P3HT enriched at the top of the active layer, which is beneficial for inverted solar cells.22
Encouraged by the good function of the thermo-cleavable fullerene buffer layers in P3HT/PC61BM solar cells, we tried to apply the buffer layers to enhance the performance of solar cells based on an outstanding low bandgap polymer PBDTTT-C and PC71BM (Fig. 5). Solar cells with configurations of ITO/ZnO/PBDTTT-C:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w)/MoO3/Ag (device D), ITO/ZnO/MCA1/PBDTTT-C:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w)/MoO3/Ag (device E), and ITO/ZnO/MCA2/PBDTTT-C:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w)/MoO3/Ag (device F) were studied. Similar to P3HT/PC61BM cells, devices E and F with MCAs showed better performance compared with the reference device D (Fig. 6b and Table 1). Device F with MCA2 showed a PCE of 7.57% (Voc 0.72 V, Jsc 16.7 mA cm−2, and FF 63%). The PCE enhancement in two types of solar cells by using bis-DBMD indicates that it is a promising interfacial material for application in inverted organic solar cells.
Conclusions
A new class of thermo-cleavable fullerene materials was developed to be used as buffer layers for improving the performance of inverted PSCs. The thermo-cleavage concept was realized by designing and synthesizing tertiary alkyl ester group-modified fullerene precursors, DBMD, BMHMD, and bis-DBMD, which can undergo a thermo-cleavage to produce insoluble fullerenes with carboxylic acid groups (MCAs) in situ. MCA buffer layers enhance the performance of inverted solar cells by improving exciton dissociation and electron transport and decreasing series resistance. MCA2 with three carboxylic acid groups generated from bis-DBMD exhibited better function than MCA1 with one carboxylic acid group from BMHMD. Using MCA2 as the buffer layer, 19% and 9% enhancement in PCE were achieved for P3HT/PC61BM and PBDTTT-C/PC71BM solar cells, respectively. These results indicate the potential of thermo-cleavable fullerene derivative bis-DBMD in making highly efficient inverted solar cells.

Device fabrication
A patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 was ultrasonically cleaned using detergent, distilled water, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially and then subjected to UV–ozone treatment. The ZnO precursor was prepared according to the literature.10b The ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated (4000 rpm for 30 s) onto an ITO-glass substrate. The films were annealed at 200 °C for 30 min in air. The ZnO film thickness is about 30 nm. A precursor (BMHMD or bis-DBMD) solution (4 mg mL−1) in ODCB was spin-coated (1200 rpm for 60 s) onto ZnO. A BMHMD or bis-DBMD film was heated at 160 °C and 180 °C for 10 min to turn into a MCA1 or MCA2 film, respectively. A P3HT/PC61BM blend in ODCB (1:1 w/w, 34 mg mL−1) was spin-coated (800 rpm for 30 s) onto MCA. Then, the wet blend films were put into glass Petri dishes to undergo the solvent annealing process.23 The thicknesses of the active layers (∼180 nm) were measured by a KLA Tencor D-120 profilometer. Finally, MoO3 (∼7 nm) and Ag (∼100 nm) were thermally evaporated under a shadow mask (pressure: ca. 10−4 Pa). The effective area of the devices is 4 mm2. J–V curves were measured on a computerized Keithley 2420 SourceMeter. The measurements were done in air under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation (calibrated with a NREL certified standard silicon cell (4 cm2)) from a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Newport Oriel Solar Simulator, Model 91159A). For PBDTTT-C/PC71BM cells, the fabrication process is similar except active layer fabrication: a PBDTTT-C/PC71BM blend in ODCB (1:1.5 w/w, 15 mg mL−1) with 3 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was spin-coated (800 rpm for 60 s) onto MCAs.
