    , Accepted 19th May 2015First published on 4th June 2015AbstractDouble magnetron sputtering (DMS) is an efficient system that is well known because of its precise control of the thin film synthesizing process over any kind of substrate. Here, DMS has been adopted to synthesize BiVO4 films over a conducting substrate (FTO), using metallic vanadium and ceramic Bi2O3 targets simultaneously. The films were characterized using different techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and profilometry. The photo-electrochemical analysis was performed using linear scan voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under the illumination of simulated solar light at 1 Sun. The photocurrent density of the sputtered BiVO4 thin films could be improved from 0.01 mA cm−2 to 1.19 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE by chemical treatment using potassium hydroxide (KOH). The effect of KOH was the removal of impurities from the grain boundaries, leading to a more porous structure and more pure crystalline monoclinic BiVO4 particles. Such variations in the microstructure as well as the improvement of the charge transfer properties of the BiVO4 film after the KOH treatment were confirmed and studied in depth by EIS analysis.
Introduction
Water oxidation is a process that is considered to be one of the most difficult and important reactions, in view of the end products and its application in diverse fields.1 Moreover, the use of the visible light portion of sunlight for the water oxidation process is another challenge that requires the development of new materials2 to function as photo-anodes. Among the different metal oxide semiconductor materials that are available for this reaction, BiVO4 has been proved to be one of the most interesting.3–5
BiVO4 is a metal oxide semiconductor that has a suitable band gap position for the water oxidation process.6 Its band gap is considered to be between 2.3 and 2.8 eV, which is the energy associated with the visible region of the solar spectrum. BiVO4 occurs in three phases: monoclinic scheelite, tetragonal scheelite and tetragonal zircon. Comparatively, monoclinic scheelite BiVO4 is considered as the most photoactive phase, as it shows a higher ability to oxidize water into O2.4
The synthesis of a photo-anode using BiVO4 is a challenging task.7 A successful photo-anode should have the following properties in order to have a good activity: high-energy conversion efficiency, high stability, low-cost production, and a simple structure for the effective utilization of the photo-anode area.8 In this context, there are a number of procedures that can be employed to synthesize BiVO4 photo-anodes, and some of them have been shown to be successful in achieving the above-required characteristics of a thin film.4 Photo-anodes of BiVO4 have been prepared using BiVO4 powders,9 solutions,10–14 and directly employing precursor materials.15,16
Recently, thin BiVO4 photo-anode films have been synthesized from inorganic precursors through chemical vapor deposition15,17 and physical vapor deposition (PVD).16,18 Among the PVD methods, magnetron sputtering is a scalable technique that is widely used in industry for the synthesis of thin films of various materials on different substrates. In this paper, the dual magnetron sputtering (DMS) method has been used for the synthesis of thin BiVO4 films. Chen et al. have reported the production of BiVO4 thin films by DMS using the same target configuration. The photocurrent achieved for the pure BiVO4 films was 0.5 mA cm−1.2,16 Further improvement was achieved after addition of WO3 layers or Mo doping.19 In the present paper, we show that it is also possible to improve the photocurrent of the sputtered BiVO4 by a simple chemical treatment using potassium hydroxide (KOH). The effect of the KOH treatment on the composition, microstructure, optical properties and electrochemical response is presented. DMS can be considered to be very important in this field, since the same process could also be used to improve the performance of thin films through various modifications, such as doping,20 co-catalyst addition21,22 or hetero-junction formation.23
Materials and methods
(a) Double magnetron sputtering deposition of BiVO4 films
The employed DMS chamber is described in Fig. 1. In order to investigate the effects of the chemical composition on the electrical and optical properties, BiVO4 films were deposited using reactive magnetron sputtering under different conditions, and the best condition was chosen for a more detailed investigation. The magnetron sputtering system was equipped with two confocal planar magnetron sources, with their axes positioned at about 25° or 30° off the vertical (Bi2O3 (99.999 at%) and V (99.95 at%)), while the substrate–target distance was fixed at 100 mm to avoid angular deposition effects. The substrates were mounted onto a rotary sample holder manipulator in order to guarantee film homogeneity. The deposition chamber was connected to a turbomolecular pump through an adaptive pressure controller valve, which allowed the final total pressure in the sputtering chamber to be fixed. Mass flow regulators were fitted to control the sputtering Ar and O2 gases independently. The target diameters were 5 cm in both cases. Before the deposition of the films, the residual pressure in the sputtering chamber was 10−6 Torr. Initially, different deposition conditions were considered; the power applied to the targets, the substrate temperature and the Ar/O2 flow ratios were varied. The structural characterization using X-ray diffraction including high temperature analysis made it possible to select the conditions to obtain the monoclinic phase. Previous results in the literature of BiVO4 films prepared by DMS indicated that such a phase could only be produced after thermal annealing (about 500 °C) of the samples in air.16 However, we used a lower annealing temperature (400 °C) since the in situ annealing XRD analysis demonstrated that the monoclinic phase was already formed at 300 °C as observed in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Moreover, a KOH chemical treatment (1 M for 20 min) was also used in order to improve the photocurrent density. The conditions reported here correspond to a high DC power of 165 W applied to the V target, and an RF power of 30 W applied to the Bi2O3 target for a period of 25 min. The substrate temperature was kept constant at room temperature, and the total working pressure, PT = (PAr + PO2), was fixed at 5 × 10−3 torr using an O2/Ar flow ratio of 2/18.

(b) Thin film characterization
The samples were characterized using the following instruments: the diffraction patterns were obtained before and after annealing using a Rigaku Ultima IV system with a thin film mode attachment, but using the Bragg–Brentano configuration equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and a chamber for in situ programmed temperature analysis; the Raman characterization was performed using En-Spectra R532, an enhanced spectroscopy instrument equipped with an Olympus CX41 Microscope system with a green laser (532 nm wavelength); the UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded in transmittance mode on a UV-Vis Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer; the morphology of the samples was investigated by means of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), using an FE-SEM MERLIN ZEISS, equipped with an energy-dispersive analysis system (EDS), which was employed to obtain insight into the bulk elemental composition of the sample; thickness measurements were conducted using a DEKTAK profilometer on a step intentionally left for such purposes. The XPS analyses were carried out using a VG Escalab 200-C X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a non-monochromatic Mg–K source. A pass energy of 20 eV, resolution of 1.1 eV, and step of 0.2 eV were used for high-resolution spectra.
(c) Photo-electrochemical tests
Photo-electrochemical characterizations of the BiVO4 electrodes were carried out in an aqueous 0.1M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution (pH ∼ 6.2), employing a multi-channel VSP potentiostat/galvanostat made by BioLogic. A three-electrode system, consisting of the BiVO4 material as the working electrode, a platinum counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl (3 M) as the reference electrode, was used. Linear scan voltammetries (LSVs) were performed in the dark and under simulated solar light, using a 450 W Xe lamp by Newport with an AM 1.5 filter and a water filter. The intensity of the light was maintained at 100 mW cm−2 by adjusting the distance between the source and the photo-electrochemical cell (PEC). Chrono-amperometric (I–t) measurements were performed at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl over continuous ON–OFF light cycles. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted in the frequency range of 100 mHz to 1 MHz, with an amplitude of 25 mV, under an applied DC potential of 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, under the above reported simulated sunlight conditions. The EIS data were modeled using an EIS analyzer (open source).24 The electrochemical data presented in the work refer to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential, calculated using ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.209 V + 0.059 pH.
Results and discussion
The thin BiVO4 films were successfully synthesized by employing the DMS method. The structure of the samples was characterized using XRD (Fig. 2a), where the patterns before and after the KOH treatment are presented. It was found that the as-deposited samples were amorphous (see Fig. S1 in ESI†), but a thermal annealing at 400 °C in air led to the formation of the monoclinic phase of BiVO4 (JCPDS data sheet of 14-0688, space group I2/a, a = 5.195 Å, b = 11.701 Å, c = 5.092 Å, β = 90.38°).

Fig. 2b shows the UV-Visible spectroscopy analyses, which provide details regarding the absorbance spectrum of the BiVO4 thin films. The spectrum before the KOH treatment shows a band edge at around 500 nm, as it consists of different kinds of impurities. After the KOH treatment, the spectrum shows a red shift of a band edge to a higher wavelength of around 533 nm, and it refers to the intrinsic nature of monoclinic BiVO4.25 From such band edge positions, the band gap of the materials before and after the treatment was found to be about 2.48 and 2.32 eV, respectively.

Fig. 3(a) and (b) provide details of the FESEM characterizations of the samples in order to have an understanding of the morphological changes due to the KOH treatment. The image exhibits the details of the samples without (a1, a2) and with (b1, b2) the KOH treatment. It should be noted that KOH increased the sample porosity. Although the effect of the KOH treatment was not so evident from XRD analysis, the FESEM images indicate the formation of a porous structure by removing the unwanted excess impurities over and around the monoclinic BiVO4 grains, thus improving the surface exposure of the films.

The EDS analysis in Fig. 3c and d gives information on the bulk elemental analysis of the thin films before and after the KOH treatment, respectively. The composition of the films after the chemical treatment with KOH was almost in agreement with the equimolar bismuth to vanadium ratios present in the BiVO4. Meanwhile, the EDS analysis before the treatment showed an excess of V probably segregated into the grain boundaries and that was removed by the chemical treatment using KOH. The use of KOH to preferentially remove excess of V from V-rich BiVO4 films has also been reported for dip-coated or electrochemical deposited films.4,26 Interestingly, for the sputtered BiVO4 films, the KOH creates an open structure which suggests that it preferentially attacks the grain boundaries, although the whole thickness was also reduced, as described later. The formation of this porous structure has the advantage of increasing the interfacial area between the electrolyte and the film, as compared to a non-porous structure.27 The photo-generated holes will have to migrate less bulk material, in order to reach the solution interface, and thus the probability of recombining before participating in the electrochemical reaction reduces. This particular characteristic of the photo-electrode provides an additional feature that can improve the water splitting efficiency.28 In fact, porosity in general has a benefit on the catalytic behavior of the sample since it increases the number of exposed catalytic sites. The thickness of the samples before and after the KOH treatment was measured using a profilometer, and it was observed that it decreased from around 400 nm (before) to 280 nm after the KOH treatment (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). Such thickness decrement could also improve the photocurrent, as has been reported by Chen et al.19 However, we did not observe it for films deposited at different deposition times, but only by the KOH treatment.
Raman spectroscopy can provide structural information and is also a sensitive method for the investigation of the crystallization, local structure and electronic properties of materials. Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of the thin films before and after the KOH treatment. The Raman spectra of the non-treated film show only two peaks from the monoclinic BiVO4; the peak centered at around 201 cm−1 and the vibrational mode of the V–O bond centered at around 826 cm−1. On the other hand, two other peaks centered at ∼282 and 306 cm−1 confirmed the presence of vanadium oxide impurities.29,30 After the KOH treatment, a perfect match of the Raman spectrum with the monoclinic BiVO4 was observed, compared with the RRUFF database of the Raman spectroscopy. Indeed, Raman bands at ∼210, 324, 366, 710, and 826 cm−1, which are the typical vibrational bands of BiVO4, were observed for this thin film.31The structural information of BiVO4 is obtained from the band centered at 210 cm−1. The asymmetric and symmetric formations of the VO4 tetrahedron are given by the bands centered at 324 and 366 cm−1, respectively. The stretching modes of the two vibrational modes of the V–O bonds are determined from the bands centered at 710 and 826 cm−1.10,25

Fig. 5 shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the thin monoclinic BiVO4 films before and after the KOH treatment, indicating the chemical states on the surface. The C1s peak at 284.6 eV was used for calibration purposes. Before and after the KOH-treatment: the two main asymmetric peaks, Bi4f7/2 and Bi4f5/2, are observed at 158.88 and 164.23 eV, respectively (see Fig. 5a), while the asymmetric V2p3/2 peak can be observed at a binding energy of 516.5 eV (see Fig. 5b). Before the KOH-treatment, a high intensity of the O1s peak at around 533 eV can be observed, as shown in Fig. 5c, which most probably arises from either oxygen vacancies or adsorbed oxygen species (O− and O2−).25,32 In fact, after the KOH treatment, the O1s spectra evidenced a sharp peak at around 529.74 eV and small peaks at around 531–533 eV. These peaks represent the lattice oxygen (Olatt) (V–O) and the adsorbed oxygen (Oads) species on the surface of the thin film, respectively.

Fig. 6a shows that the thin films before the treatment have different levels of vanadium oxide contamination. The presence of V+3, V+4 and V+5 at 515.2 eV,33 516.2 eV34 and 516.5 eV,35 respectively, is evident from the de-convoluted V2p3/2 peak. The distribution of the V+5:V+4:V+3 ratios from the areas was found to be 39:36:25. The vanadium oxide impurities result in the film due to remains of vanadium after the formation of the monoclinic BiVO4 phase during annealing at 400 °C. Hence there should be a large number of oxygen vacancies, which are induced by the V+4 and V+3. These oxygen vacancies, having positive charges, tend to interact with the negative charges on the surface, such as O− and O2− that arise from the atmosphere and because of the thermal treatment conditions that were employed. After the KOH treatment, the V2p2/3 peak seems to be symmetric (see Fig. 6b), but it is possible to have some traces of V+4 impurities in the BiVO4 film throughout the thickness. The treated film hence shows fewer adsorbed O− and O2− species than the untreated film. From Fig. 6c and d, the Olatt:Oads ratio before the treatment was found to be around 18:82, which is greatly decreased to 65:35 after the KOH treatment.

Photo-catalytic activity
The photo-catalytic activity of the BiVO4 films was evaluated by using them as anodes for the photo-electrochemical water splitting reaction. Fig. 7a shows the LSV curves of the photo-electrodes acquired under AM1.5G illumination, where the current density is a function of the applied potential in the PEC system. In general, the current density remains negligible until the water oxidation onset potential is reached: this potential represents the thermodynamic limit value beyond which water electrolysis occurs.
 Fig. 7  (a) Photocurrent–potential curves at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1: before and after the KOH-treatment and (b) chronoamperometric measurement at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl of the sample after the KOH treatment. Both measurements were carried out in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. 
The curves are characterized by an onset potential well below 1.23 V, which represents the minimum voltage that should be applied to obtain cold water dissociation under dark conditions:36,37 this feature highlights the photo-catalytic activity of the fabricated films. The maximum photocurrent obtained from the BiVO4 thin film treated with KOH, which was synthesized under given conditions (see Materials and methods), was 1.19 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 7a). Among several possible synthesis methods, the obtained photocurrent density by the BiVO4 electrode emphasizes the importance of synthesis and post treatment proposed. In fact, the KOH treatment, on the as-annealed thin films produced by DMS, induces the formation of a more porous structure by removing the unwanted material from the surface as well as around the grain boundaries of the monoclinic BiVO4 crystals, thus increasing the number of catalytic sites, which in turn improves the photo-current density by 120-fold. Indeed, the photocurrent reported here is among the best values for BiVO4 photo-electrode systems as summarized by Park et al.4 in 2013, even without the use of co-catalysts or doping. Moreover, the above mentioned sputtering technique has many advantages over other thin film synthesis techniques, as it is an industrially scalable and reliable technique for the production of thin films with homogenous and continuous surfaces.
Similarly, Fig. 7b represents the chronoamperometric measurements, which were performed in order to check the stability of the BiVO4 photoanode and have revealed that the current density was stable for a long period of time. In fact, the I–t curves show good photocurrent stability under numerous ON–OFF light cycles. The charge transfer and transport mechanisms that occur in the BiVO4 thin films before and after the KOH treatment were carefully analyzed by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique, in order to obtain a better understanding of the electrode behavior, as reported in the following section.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
EIS is a well-known technique that is often employed to characterize electrochemical systems and devices for different kinds of applications,38 including photo-electrochemical water splitting.39

Fig. 8 shows the results of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements with an applied DC potential of 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl under AM1.5G simulated sunlight conditions (at 1 Sun). In the Nyquist plots in Fig. 8a, a wide semi-circle at low frequencies and a small semi-circle at high frequencies are observed, which can be correlated with both structural and photocatalytic properties of the films. In accordance with the LSVs, the impedance of the non-treated BiVO4 electrode is higher than that of the KOH treated materials, which in turn corresponds to a decrease in the number of electrons transferred through the electrode–electrolyte interface.40 Moreover, from the Bode diagram in Fig. 8b (phase vs. frequency) two features can be recognized, related to the two different processes occurring in the analyzed electrodes: a high frequency peak (above 1000 Hz), associated with the charge transport properties in the bulk of the photo-electrode materials, and a low frequency peak (between 1 and 1000 Hz) associated with the charge transfer at the photo-electrode–electrolyte interface.41 In order to evaluate the time constants associated with such two processes, EIS spectra were modeled by using the equivalent circuit (EC) shown in Fig. 8c.38,42,43 This EC has been previously used to evaluate the different charge transport phenomena occurring in n-type semiconductors and other porous materials:38,39,42,44R indicates a resistance and Q is a constant phase elements (CPEs), representing a non-ideal capacitance associated with a non-uniform current distribution in heterogeneous materials. The impedance of a CPE is defined as: (2)where n (0 < n <1) is the CPE index.44 The lower is n, the higher is the roughness associated with the electrode surface. The capacitance associated with the CPE is given by: C = Q(1/n)R((1/n)−1)(2)
 Fig. 8  (a) Bode and (b) Nyquist plots of impedance of the BiVO4 electrodes before and after the KOH treatment at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM1.5G simulated sunlight in the Na2SO4 (0.1 M) electrolyte. (c) Equivalent circuit used to fit EIS data and schematic representation of the thin film structure. 
In particular, Rs is the series resistance, which comprises the FTO film, the external electrical contacts and the liquid electrolyte. The two parallels R//Q correspond to the two distinct charged regions induced in semiconductor electrodes during the electrochemical processes: (i) the Helmholtz double-layer formed at the BiVO4–electrolyte interface (related to RH//QH) and (ii) the depletion layer in the semiconductor side,39,42 across which a potential gradient exists (related to Rdl//Qdl). The time constants corresponding to the transport and transfer of charge carriers in such regions can be calculated through the expression: τ = R·C(3)
By comparing the markers and the continuous lines in Fig. 8 it is evident that the fitted data agree very well with the experimental ones. The charge transport time constant (τdl) in both the BiVO4 films remained of the same order of magnitude after the KOH treatment (i.e. 2.8 × 10−2 and 3.3 × 10−2 ms, for the non-treated and the treated samples, respectively). Such values also agree with the similar position of the phase peak in the high frequency region for both samples and confirm that the KOH treatment does not alter the bulk properties of the BiVO4 electrode. On the other hand, the time constant related to the charge transfer at the Helmholtz double layer (τH) resulted to be about 2.2 s for the non-treated BiVO4 film and 3.2 ms for the KOH treated BiVO4 one. This means that the KOH treatment was able to improve the charge transfer, and thus the kinetics of the photocatalytic water oxidation, by speeding up the reaction by three orders of magnitude, as it was already evidenced by the current–potential curves in Fig. 7a. This result is also evident from the shift of the phase peak of the Bode plot from about 2 Hz up to about 200 Hz, and the related reduction on the charge transfer resistance from about 11200 to 280 Ω cm−2, before and after the KOH treatment, respectively. This noteworthy result is in line with the hypothesis that after the BiVO4 synthesis by DMS and annealing, some non-active vanadium oxide was also formed in the film surface thus reducing the reactivity of the monoclinic BiVO4, which in turn remains totally exposed after the KOH treatment. In addition, it is important to highlight that the CPE index at the electrode–electrolyte interphase (nH), which decreased from 0.86 to 0.79 after the KOH treatment, indicates a relative increase in the porosity of the materials.38,42 This result further confirms the porous nature of the KOH treated BiVO4 film prepared using the DMS procedure and supports the increase of its effective roughness (i.e. porosity and effective active areas) after the removal of the superficial non-active species.
Conclusions
In this work, DMS and a post-treatment of the as-annealed samples with KOH have successfully been implemented for the synthesis of thin and porous BiVO4 films with the monoclinic scheelite-like phase. The stoichiometric ratio of the individual elements of the BiVO4 layer was obtained by means of a treatment with a 1 M KOH solution, as confirmed using EDS, XPS, and Raman analysis. The charge transport and transfer properties of the BiVO4 film have been analyzed by using EIS, and the photo-electrochemical performance has been assessed using LSVs and amperometric measurements. It has been observed that the thin BiVO4 film produced a photo-current density of 1.19 mA cm−2 at a bias voltage of 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM1.5G simulated sunlight maintained at 1 Sun. Future studies are in progress for further modifications (doping, co-catalyst addition, etc.) of the BiVO4 thin films in order to improve their water oxidation capabilities.
