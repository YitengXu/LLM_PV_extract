    , Accepted 2nd July 2019First published on 2nd July 2019AbstractHerein, acceptor–donor–acceptor structured small molecule (ITIC) based nanoparticles (NPs) were explored for photothermal therapy application. ITIC NPs show red-shift absorption in the near-infrared region, high photostability, and high photothermal conversion efficiency under laser irradiation, presenting both excellent cancer cell cytotoxicity in vitro and tumor ablation in vivo.
Photothermal therapy (PTT), utilizing light-absorbing agents to produce localized heat under laser (usually near-infrared (NIR) light) irradiation for tumor ablation, has attracted extensive research interests in past decades.1,2 Compared to traditional cancer treatments, PTT shows a noninvasive and efficient approach without injuring the surrounding normal tissues, since hyperthermia is generated simultaneously in the presence of light-absorbing photothermal agents in tumor sites and a localized NIR laser. Photothermal agents, a key factor in PTT, have been developed for several years. Among various PTT agents, inorganic materials, including Au, Pd, and Ag-based metal nanoparticles (NPs),3 transition metal sulfide nanosheets,4 and tungsten oxide materials,5 possess localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties, which generate high energy carriers (electron–hole pairs) on the surface of the nano-structure for photothermal conversion. However, the less absorption in the NIR region, potential long-term toxicity, and poor biodegradability in vivo of these inorganic materials greatly hamper their further transformation in clinic. For instance, carbon nanotubes may lead to pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress, and metal NPs are hardly metabolized in organisms.6 Different from inorganic materials, organic dyes usually possess excellent biocompatibility. So, various organic dyes (including semiconductor polymers and small molecules) with donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) structures have been developed as biocompatible alternative PTT agents.7,8 Noteworthily, indocyanine green (ICG) has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a kind of fluorescent contrast agent, which also presents moderate photothermal conversion.9,10 However, most small organic molecules face the problems of poor water solubility, inferior photostability, low photothermal conversion efficiency and no tumor targeting ability. Even more, the conjugated polymers confront risks of the unknown biodegradation and uncertain molecular weight, and so on.
With the excellent biocompatibility, organic material (especially small molecule) based photothermal agents keep the most promising potential for clinical transformation, thereby many efforts have been made to design nano-platforms and discover novel agents to overcome the problems mentioned above. For example, Guo et al. developed a nanodrug delivery system with good water stability by a self-assembly method, which was formed by amphipathic ICG, hydrophobic paclitaxel and ursolic acid via π–π stacking, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions.11 The self-assembling nanosystem significantly enhanced the photostability of ICG for effective long-term tumor PTT and NIR fluorescence imaging. In particular, based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, the nanosystem can be passively targeted to the tumor site for more efficient accumulation. Recently, our group reported a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)12,13 and boron dipyrromethene (Bodipy)14,15 structured small molecule-based dyes with high photostability and NIR absorption. Most of these molecules showed good solubility and high fluorescence quantum yields in organic solutions. After the formation of NPs in aqueous solution, fluorescence is greatly quenched and photothermal conversion apparently increased, and they have been demonstrated as efficient PTT agents with a red-shift absorption spectrum in the J-aggregate state.16 In fact, most studies on organic molecule-based PTT agents have focused on the electron-rich D–A–D structure with easy charge transfer under illumination for efficient photothermal conversion. However, the electron-deficiency acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) small molecules, the backbone architecture of which is usually composed of two strong electron-withdrawing end units and a ladder-type electron-donating core unit, can provide stronger intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), higher light harvesting capability and more easily tuned energy levels for a bathochromic-shift.17 So, the A–D–A structured small molecule-based NPs may exhibit better photothermal conversion performance than these D–A–D structures.
Herein, for the first time, we explored the PTT potential of a typical A–D–A structured small molecule 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (named ITIC).18 Carbonyl and cyano groups on the structure as electron-withdrawing units can down shift the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels. The push–pull structure of ITIC has strong and broad absorption in the red light range and induces intramolecular charge transfer. Besides, four 4-hexylphenyl substituents out of the ITIC main plane can improve solubility in common organic solvents and restrict molecular planarity for easy aggregation. ITIC possesses low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO energy levels (−5.48 and −3.83 eV, respectively), high molar absorption coefficient, and good electron transport ability, which provide promising superiority for PTT in the NIR region.19 By using the reprecipitation method,20 the ITIC NPs were further formed via π–π interactions without any surfactant, which provide reinforced and enhanced A–D–A structures, and present a red-shift absorption spectrum and stronger photostability compared to free ITIC molecules. Besides, the ITIC NPs show excellent water dispersity and tumor passive targeting ability based on the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect, making them serve as potential agents for tumor targeting treatment.21 More importantly, ITIC NPs show higher photothermal conversion efficiency (∼41.6%) than many other reported organic PTT agents, endowing them with excellent in vitro cancer cell cytotoxicity and in vivo tumor ablation (Scheme 1).22,23 The A–D–A structured ITIC-based NPs have enriched the organic PTT agents’ family and have great promising potential for future clinical application.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the formation of ITIC NPs and their application in tumor photothermal therapy. 
A–D–A structured ITIC with a narrow band gap (1.65 eV)19 and good intramolecular charge transport ability has great potential to be used as a photothermal agent. To overcome the inherent water insolubility of organic ITIC molecules, ITIC NPs were synthesized by the reprecipitation method. Without any hydrophilic substances, ITIC NPs were present as a transparent liquid in aqueous solutions (blue colour) with excellent stability (Fig. 1a). The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image indicated that ITIC NPs exhibit a diameter less than 40 nm with spherical morphology (Fig. 1b). As shown in Fig. 1c, DLS analysis further demonstrates that ITIC NPs have an average size of ∼32 nm. Moreover, the diameter of ITIC NPs in PBS shows almost no change in 7 days, indicating excellent stability (Fig. S1, ESI†).24 The UV-vis absorption spectrum showed that ITIC had absorption with a maximum peak at 658 nm in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution, which benefits from its A–D–A conjugated structure (Fig. 1d). After the formation of NPs, the absorption spectrum of ITIC NPs shows an apparent red-shift with a maximum absorption peak at 696 nm in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). This phenomenon can be explained by the formation of J-aggregated NPs, which enhances the intermolecular A–D–A structure and leads to a longer π-conjugation. It is worth noting that ITIC NPs in PBS present much better photostability (no change after laser irradiation for 20 minutes, 660 nm, 1 W cm−2) (Fig. 1f) than ITIC molecules in THF (continuous degradation with 660 nm laser irradiation in short time) (Fig. 1e), which indicates that the stronger framework of ITIC NPs can greatly enhance their photostability.

(f) UV-vis absorption spectra of ITIC NPs in PBS (pH = 7.4) under 660 nm laser irradiation (1 W cm−2) over time. 
With good optical performance of ITIC NPs in PBS, the fluorescence imaging property and photothermal conversion efficiency were meaured subsequently. As shown in Fig. 2a, ITIC NPs in PBS exhibit an obvious fluorescence peak at 803 nm (quantum yield is ∼9.62%),25 which is bathochromically shifted compared to that of the ITIC molecule (fluorescence peak at 720 nm, Fig. S2, ESI†) and suggests potential application for NIR fluorescence imaging. As expected, ITIC NP solution showed an enhanced fluorescence signal with increased concentration (Fig. 2b). At a concentration of 40 μg mL−1, the fluorescence intensity of ITIC NPs was adequately bright, showing the potential application for further in vivo imaging. Fig. 2c shows that the temperature difference (ΔT) of ITIC NPs (40 μg mL−1) increased ∼35 °C in 600 s under laser (660 nm, 1 W cm−2) irradiation, and ΔT obviously decreased with a decrease in power density, showing obvious laser power intensity dependence. Besides, ITIC NPs also presented a concentration dependent photothermal conversion at a constant laser irradiation power (660 nm, 1 W cm−2, Fig. 2d). The photothermal conversion efficiency of ITIC NPs is ∼41.6% according to the reported calculation method,26 which is adequate for PTT. These results confirm that ITIC NPs possess efficient functions of fluorescence imaging and photothermal therapy, making them potential nano-agents for cancer theranostics.

ITIC NPs exhibited a NIR fluorescence emission peak, which suggests that their cellular uptake can be visualized by confocal fluorescence imaging. As shown in Fig. 3a, SCC4 cells were employed to investigate cellular uptake of ITIC NPs, which was revealed by red color. After incubation of ITIC NPs (10 μg mL−1, 200 μL) for 24 h in SCC4 cells, it was found that the NPs could be availably taken up into the cytosol. Then, the cytotoxicity of ITIC NPs at different concentrations with or without illumination was further assessed by using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays.27 As shown in Fig. 3b, the cell viability shows no obvious reduction without laser irradiation even at a high concentration (20 μg mL−1), indicating that ITIC NPs have good biocompatibility. Differently, upon laser irradiation (660 nm, 1 W cm−2), the cell viability significantly decreased and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value was calculated to be ∼2.5 μg mL−1, suggesting the high photothermal efficiency of ITIC NPs.

To further examine the passive tumor-targeting property based on EPR effects in vivo, ITIC NPs were intravenously injected into SCC4 tumor-bearing nude mice. As shown in Fig. 4a, an obvious fluorescence signal can be found in the tumor site in 2 hours, indicating that the NPs could be accumulated within tumors. Then, the mice were sacrificed to study the ex vivo fluorescence imaging of tumors and main organs. As expected, a strong fluorescence signal was observed in the tumor site, weak fluorescence was observed in the liver, and no obvious fluorescence can be observed in other organs (Fig. 4b and Fig. S3a, ESI†). In addition, the distribution quantification of ITIC NPs was also measured through UV-vis absorption (Fig. S3b, ESI†) after extracting the NPs from tumors and organs, which presents a similar result to fluorescence imaging and further confirms that ITIC NPs possess efficient tumor passive targeting ability. With the capacity of photothermal conversion, in vivo infrared thermal imaging was further employed after the injection of ITIC NPs into the mice for 2 hours and irradiation by a laser (660 nm, 1 W cm−2). As shown in Fig. 4c, the temperature of tumors in ITIC NP injection mice rapidly increased and reached ∼56 °C at 8 minutes, the temperature of which can ablate tumor tissues effectively.28 In contrast, tumors of the PBS injection group show no obvious temperature increase under the same irradiation conditions. These results confirm that ITIC NPs possess both excellent fluorescence imaging and infrared thermal imaging abilities, enabling potential in vivo fluorescence imaging-guided PTT.

(c) Representative tumor-bearing mice infrared thermal images after injection of ITIC NPs or PBS under laser irradiation (660 nm, 1 W cm−2). (d) Temperatures of the tumor sites at different times. 
18 SCC4 tumor bearing mice with different treatments were randomly divided into 3 groups. As shown in Fig. 5a, tumor volumes of the laser irradiation only group and the ITIC NP only group increased rapidly during the whole treatment period. In contrast, the tumor volumes in the group of ITIC NP injection with laser irradiation (660 nm, 1.0 W cm−2) were diminished and almost eliminated after treatment 3 times, demonstrating the excellent PTT effect of ITIC NPs. Fig. 5b respectively shows the representative photographs of mice with different treatments after 12 days, and the tumor apparently disappeared after PTT, but tumors in the other two groups became very huge, which more intuitively reflects the excellent PTT effect of ITIC NPs in vivo. The body weights of all the mice were recorded as shown in Fig. 5c, which presented normal growth and confirmed that ITIC NPs exhibit low toxicity and biocompatible in vivo. After treatment for 12 days, the mice were sacrificed and the major organs, including the liver, heart, lung, spleen, kidneys and tumors, were used for pathomorphology analysis. As shown in Fig. 5d, the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)29 stained tumor cells in both laser only and NP only groups showed normal differentiation, and the cell morphology and nucleolus proportion presented no obvious change. Differently, a large number of necrotic cells were found in the group of NPs + laser, indicating the excellent PTT efficiency of ITIC NPs. The tumors were stained with the marker Ki-67 to further identify the proliferation.21 As shown in Fig. 5e, the tumor cells stained strongly positive in both laser only and NP only groups with a dark brown color, and the number of positive cells was almost 100%, indicating that the cell proliferation was strong. In contrast, tumor cells in the group of NPs + laser showed negative Ki-67 staining, the number of positive cells of which was calculated to be nearly 0, meaning that the tumor cell proliferation was rather weak. These tumor immunohistochemical examinations further confirmed that ITIC NPs have excellent PTT efficacy to inhibit tumor growth.

(c) The relationship between the body weight and time of different treatment groups. (d) H&E and (e) Ki-67 staining of tumor tissues treated with laser, ITIC NPs, and ITIC NPs + laser groups, respectively. 
As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), with H&E stained in the tissue slices, no significant pathological changes were observed in the organs of all the treated nude mice. The structure of functional units of each organ was clear and complete, and the cell morphology was normal. Concretely, cardiac myocardial fibers were clearly arranged with clear structures without obvious pathological changes. The liver lobule structure was clear and complete without obvious injury. There was no obvious abnormality of the spleen. The glomerular structure of kidneys was clear and the contour of the glomerular wall was complete without obvious injury. The alveolar structure was intact without obvious pathological changes. These results demonstrate that ITIC NPs are biocompatible to normal organs and can serve as an excellent therapeutic agent for imaging guided tumor PTT without a noticeable side effect.
In summary, based on a typical A–D–A structured small molecule ITIC, we prepared ITIC NPs via the reprecipitation method for imaging guided PTT. ITIC NPs were formed with reinforced and enhanced A–D–A structures, showing a red-shift absorption spectrum and good photostability compared with free ITIC molecules. Besides, the NPs have excellent water dispersity and tumor passive targeting ability, enabling their application in tumor targeting treatment. More importantly, ITIC NPs show high photothermal conversion efficiency (∼41.6%) and excellent tumor ablation in vivo, and have great promising potential for future clinical application.
