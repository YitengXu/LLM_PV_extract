    , Accepted 15th February 2011First published on 4th March 2011AbstractWe prepared vertically aligned nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on a rigid glass substrate or flexible plastic substrate via a ‘growth-detachment-transfer’ process and the vertically aligned N-doped CNT arrays are employed as counter electrodes for novel dye-sensitized solar cells.
Typical dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) consist of interconnected TiO2 nanocrystals, dye sensitizers, iodine/iodide electrolytes, and thin platinum (Pt) counter electrodes deposited on transparent conductive oxides (TCOs). Such device systems are generally less expensive than conventional inorganic photovoltaic devices.1 During the last two decades, much effort has been focused on the optimization of TiO2 nanocrystals, dye sensitizers, and electrolytes. Because Pt exhibits high electrocatatytic activity toward the iodide/triiodide redox couple, it is the common redox relay for most DSSCs. However, the Pt counter electrode, which offers superior electric conductivity, electrocatalytic activity and stability, constitutes the most expensive component in DSSCs. The high cost of Pt has encouraged research efforts to exploit alternative counter electrode materials.2
Recently, carbon-based materials have been actively exploited as Pt-free counter electrodes. Activated carbon,3carbon nanotubes (CNTs),4graphite, and carbon powder5 have been employed as a counter electrode for DSSCs thus far. Among them, CNTs are considered a promising candidate with excellent electrochemical catalytic activities and high electrical conductivities.6 Recently, Seo et al. reported a remarkable conversion efficiency of ∼7% employing CNT-based counter electrodes.7 Cha et al.8 achieved an efficiency higher than 80% for a Pt counter electrode based DSSC using CNT microballs. However, the CNTs used in these approaches were entangled and randomly oriented, which can significantly deteriorate the performance of the CNT electrode.9 In addition, these CNT electrodes were prepared via heat treatment at temperatures above ∼400 °C to decompose the polymer binders and additives,7,8 which hinders the development of flexible DSSC systems based on plastic substrates with low thermal stability.
In this report, we demonstrate that vertically aligned nitrogen doped CNT (N-CNT) counter electrodes can be employed in DSSCs via a ‘growth-detachment-transfer’ process (Fig. 1A). This unique approach has several advantages over the previous ones: (1) Vertically aligned CNT arrays provide an extremely large surface area with a highly ordered geometry. (2) N-CNTs possess high electrical conductivity and catalytic activity.10 When electron-rich nitrogen is substitutively doped in a CNT graphite layer, the band gap of the CNT is reduced to form metallic CNTs with high catalytic activity.11 (3) This approach is substrate-independent. After growing the vertical N-CNTs via general catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the N-CNTs are readily transferrable to an arbitrary substrate.

(B) Low- and high (inset)-magnification SEM images showing cross-sectional views of the synthesized N-CNT arrays. (C) HR-TEM image of N-CNTs. (D) SEM image of transferred N-CNT arrays on ITO substrate. 

Fig. 1B and C show that the average diameter of the N-CNTs is ∼10 nm and is generally dependent upon the size of the catalyst particle. The height of the N-CNTs could be controlled in a wide range from the sub-micrometer level to several tens of micrometers (Fig. 1(B)). Fig. 1D shows a cross-sectional SEM image of the N-CNT arrays on the ITO/glass substrate after transferring them to the ITO substrate, which demonstrates the interface between the N-CNTs and the substrate. From Fig. 1D, it can be confirmed that the N-CNTs are well attached and oriented vertically on the substrate after the transfer process. Fig. 1C presents a high-resolution TEM image of the N-CNTs, whose diameter was about ∼10 nm. As can be seen in Fig. 1C, the majority were multi-walled CNTs. Fig. S1 (supporting data†) shows the nitrogen XPS peaks for the N-CNTs prepared by the ‘growth-detachment-transfer’ process. The N-CNTs were grown at an NH3 content of 20 vol% in the environmental gas. Generally, nitrogen incorporation into CNTs can be confirmed by four types of XPS peaks. Fig. S1† shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the N-doped CNTs. Fig. S1(a)† shows wide-scan XPS spectra between 0–1350 eV and atomic ratio calculated by peak areas. Four different atoms were observed in these spectra representing carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron. The atomic percentage calculated in this case is 94.25%, 3.76%, 1.61% and 0.37%, respectively. Fig. S1(b)† shows that all C1S signal of all carbons consists of a major graphitic carbon peak (CC, 284.5 eV) and small peaks around 286 eV and 291 eV, assigned to carbon associated with nitrogen and oxygen.12 Fig. S1(c)† shows the nitrogen XPS spectra. The deconvoluted spectra of the N-doped CNTs showed pyridinic (NP, 398.5 eV), quaternary (NQ, 401.5 eV) and nitrates (NOX, 406 eV).11,13 These results strongly suggest that the nitrogen was successfully incorporated into graphitic carbon. In harmony with previous carbon and nitrogen XPS results, the O1S peaks consists of nitrate (ON, 533.3 eV), quinone (OQ, 531 eV), hydroxyl (OH, 532.3 eV) and carboxyl (OC, 534.5 eV) groups (Fig. S1(d)†).14

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is used to analyze the relationship between the ion diffusivity and reaction kinetics of an electrochemical system (counter electrode). The cyclic voltammograms of the I−/I3−redox couple on the N-CNT (20 μm-thickness) coated ITO glass substrate (or plastic substrate) and Pt-coated FTO substrate are shown in Fig. 2A.

(D) IPCE spectra of DSSCs with different counter electrodes (N-CNTs and Pt). 

Fig. 2A illustrates that the N-CNT counter electrode exhibited nearly the same peak positions as the Pt counter electrode. The cathodic and anodic peak current densities of the N-CNT counter electrode were much higher than those of the Pt electrode. Therefore, the N-CNT counter electrode exhibits higher electrochemical activity, which indicates that there is a much faster reaction rate on the N-CNTs and electron transfer rate from the substrate to the N-CNTs. The observation of the peak current densities also confirms that the adhesion of the transferred N-CNT arrays to the substrate is sufficient to provide pathways for electron transportation from the TCO substrate to the N-CNTs.
A schematic diagram of a DSSC prepared with the N-CNT counter electrode is shown in Fig. 2B. Photographs of the transferred N-CNTs and the DSSC unit cell with N-CNT counter electrodes are shown in Fig. S2.† The device efficiency of the DSSCs with the N-CNT electrodes (∼20 μm) can be directly compared with that of a reference DSSC with conventional Pt electrodes, maintaining the same TiO2 layer thickness, the same dye and electrolyte, and the same cell assembly conditions, as shown in Fig. S3.†
Under illumination, the Pt based reference DSSC exhibited a Jsc of 14.9 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.80 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.62, and an overall conversion efficiency of 7.34%. The DSSC fabricated with an N-CNT counter electrode had a slightly higher fill factor of 0.67 and a Jsc of 14 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.767V, and a conversion efficiency of 7.04%. Fig. 2C represents each I–V data point obtained from the average values of at least five different cells. Several N-CNT counter electrode-based DSSCs showed slightly higher cell performances than the reference DSSCs with Pt-based counter electrode. Fig. 2D presents the IPCE spectra of the DSSCs with a Pt or N-CNT counter electrode. The quantum efficiencies of all of the cells were maximized at around 550 nm with N719 dye. The N-CNT counter electrode based DSSC exhibited a comparable quantum efficiency over the entire spectral range of incident light. Consequently, similar Jsc values were obtained for the DSSCs derived from the two different counter electrodes. Fig. S4† shows the impedance spectra for the DSSCs with different counter electrodes. Three semicircles are observed for both DSSCs. The semicircles occurring in the higher frequency (∼kHz range) were associated with charge-transfer at the counter electrode and/or electrical contact between the conductive substrate and TiO2 or TiO2 particles.15 The size of the first semicircles for the N-CNT based DSSCs were smaller than those of the DSSCs with the Pt counter electrodes. The reduced resistance can be attributed to the enhanced charge-transfer between the N-CNT counter electrode and the electrolyte. Similar behavior has previously been observed in DSSCs with a nanocarbon counter electrode.5
To investigate the effect of the length of the N-CNT electrode on the DSSC performance, several N-CNT electrodes with different lengths ranging from 2 μm to 20 μm were prepared. 20 μm is the maximum N-CNT length that can be prepared by the ‘growth-detachment-transfer’ process. Fig. 3A shows the length dependence of the DSSC performance for the N-CNT counter electrode. As the length of the N-CNT arrays is increased, the cell performance is enhanced. However, the cell performance reaches maximum value at a length of around 20 μm. In order to benefit from the positive effect of N-doping in the CNTs on the regeneration of the electrolyte, we also prepared vertically aligned pure CNT arrays and used them as the counter electrode for the DSSCs. Shown in Fig. 3B are the I–V curves of the DSSCs with the N-CNT array or pure CNT array counter electrodes. Clearly, the Voc and Jsc values of the DSSC with the pure CNT array counter electrode are very close to those of the DSSC using the N-CNTs, while its fill factor and conversion efficiency are much lower. Hence, Fig. 3B demonstrates the positive effect of the N-CNTs on the photoelectrochemical performance.

As mentioned above, vertically aligned CNT electrodes can be transferred to any kind of target substrate. For instance, aligned CNTs can be easily transferred onto flexible plastic substrates. An aligned N-CNT forest floating on a water surface was readily recovered on a flexible indium tin oxide/polyethylene naphthalate (ITO/PEN) substrate and integrated into flexible DSSCs.16 Since polymer substrates generally have a low thermal stability limit of less than 150 °C, the direct CVD growth of CNTs on such polymer substrates is not feasible. The vertically aligned N-CNTs transferred onto conducting plastic substrates are suitable for use in flexible DSSCs. Fig. 4 shows the J–V characteristics of a flexible DSSC with Pt coated ITO/PEN substrate or N-CNT on ITO/PEN substrate. The cells based on the Pt/ITO/PEN substrate and N-CNT/ITO/PEN substrate yielded almost the same I–V curves with a photocurrent of 6.8 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of ∼0.7 V, and a fill factor of 0.6, yielding a conversion efficiency of 2.85%.

We demonstrated the preparation of free-standing N-CNT arrays and their ready transfer to glass or plastic substrates. This approach is very powerful because the synthesis step is not influenced by the substrate materials. The transferred N-CNT film was tested for use as a counter electrode for DSSCs, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 7.04%, while that of a reference DSSC with a conventional Pt/TCO counter electrode was 7.34%. We also demonstrated that our method is useful for constructing flexible DSSCs. Overall, our approach involving N-CNTs offers a promising route to low-cost and substrate-independent Pt-free counter electrodes for DSSCs.
