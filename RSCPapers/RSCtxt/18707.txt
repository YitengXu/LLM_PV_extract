    , Accepted 22nd June 2022First published on 22nd June 2022AbstractIn this study, systematic structural modifications using electron-withdrawing substituents were carried out on quinoxaline-based donor–acceptor (D–A)-type polymers to achieve promising p-type polymers for photovoltaic applications. First, the polymer PB-FQxF, composed of electron-donating benzodithiophene (BDT) with two thienyl side chains and electron-accepting quinoxaline with multiple F atoms, was prepared as a reference. Afterward, two promising approaches for incorporating additional F atoms on the two thienyl groups on the BDT donor and replacing the F atom on the quinoxaline acceptor with a more electron-withdrawing CN moiety were methodically attempted to produce three target polymers, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN. Notably, the F atoms and CN units in the BDT donor and quinoxaline acceptor, respectively, can modulate the diverse properties of the polymers, leading to a positive impact on their photovoltaic properties. The performance of the PSCs was improved in the following sequence of PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN by increasing the number and strength of the existing electron-withdrawing substituents. Owing to the mutual cooperative effects of the F atom and CN unit on the BDT donor and the CN unit on the quinoxaline acceptor, respectively, the device with PBF-QxCN exhibited the best power conversion efficiency of 12.11%.
Introduction
In recent decades, considerable attention has been paid to polymer solar cells (PSC) due to their light weight, flexibility, solution processability, semitransparency, and scalable roll-to-roll compatibility.1–6 The advances in both materials science and device techniques over the last few years have significantly boosted the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. As a core component of PSCs, the photoactive layer is conventionally made up of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) composites between p-type and n-type components.2 The generation of tremendous interfacial areas between the two constituents in the BHJ structure can efficiently promote the charge dissociation and charge movement of the device. From a material point of view, the recent breakthrough in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has made great strides in enhancing the photovoltaic properties of BHJ PSCs.7–9 Compared to fullerene-based acceptors, NFAs have more advantageous features, including a favorable light absorption range, variable electronic structures, and desirable phase separation. Therefore, devices with NFAs provide much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 18% compared to devices with fullerene acceptors.10–12
Although the contribution of NFAs is enormous, the role of p-type polymer donors is still of great importance in achieving high-performance PSCs. Generally, the structures of alternating electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) components are applied for reducing the bandgaps of the polymers by generating an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state. Based on this useful concept of the D–A configuration, a wide range of promising p-type polymers have been developed for PSCs.13–16 Additionally, the use of strong electron-attracting units as additional substituents in polymer structures is considered as a potential pathway for improving the photovoltaic features of polymers.17–19 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of polymers are typically diminished with electron-withdrawing substituents. Hence, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and PCEs of the corresponding PSCs can be readily enhanced. F atoms take the leading place as an electron-withdrawing substituent owing to their small size and high electron affinity.20,21 However, other strong electron-withdrawing moieties also show considerable promise for attaining high-performance polymers. In particular, the cyano (CN) moiety has attracted great attention because it can favorably adjust the electronic structures of the polymers and induce an increased dipole moment with balanced charge transport.22–26 Moreover, the number and type of the existing electron-withdrawing moieties can play a considerable part in controlling the photovoltaic properties of the polymers.27–31 Despite these recent advances, more in-depth studies are still required to better comprehend the structure–property relationships of p-type polymer donors possessing strong electron-withdrawing substituents.
Therefore, we have developed four quinoxaline-based D–A-type polymers with diverse numbers and types of electron-attracting groups for photovoltaic applications. For the syntheses of the target polymers, thienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) and quinoxaline with two F atoms on two phenyl rings at the 2,3-position are selected as fundamental D and A building blocks, respectively. Afterward, the F atoms on the two thienyl groups of BDT and the electron-withdrawing units at the 5-position of quinoxaline are methodically controlled. The resultant polymers can be categorized into F- and CN-types according to the type of electron-attracting moiety at the 5-position of the quinoxaline unit. The coupling between the quinoxaline monomer with the F atom at the 5-position and the BDT monomers with and without F atoms at the thiophene side chains under the Stille coupling conditions can produce two F-type polymers, PB-FQxF and PBF-FQxF. In contrast, the polymerization of the CN-substituted quinoxaline monomer at the 5-position with unfluorinated and fluorinated BDT monomers affords two additional CN-type polymers, PB-FQxCN and PBF-FQxCN. The chemical structures of all polymers and their compositional differences are depicted in Fig. 1a. Once the structural, optical, and electrochemical characteristics of the polymers are analyzed, their photovoltaic properties are examined using a nonfullerene-type Y6 acceptor (Fig. 1b).32 The arrangement of the fabricated devices follows the inverted configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/polymer:Y6/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 1c). Notably, the photovoltaic performances of the devices dramatically change after applying sequential modifications to the polymer donors by adjusting the electron-withdrawing substituents. For example, the incorporation of F atoms and CN groups into the two thienyl groups of the BDT donor and the quinoxaline acceptor, respectively, can induce affirmative and synergistic influences on the photovoltaic performances of the resultant polymers. The PCEs of the devices are gradually improved by increasing the strength of the electron-withdrawing moieties in the polymers in the order of PB-FQxF (6.77%), PBF-FQxF (8.98%), PB-FQxCN (11.46%), and PBF-FQxCN (12.11%). Therefore, these findings demonstrate the importance of optimizing the number and type of electron-withdrawing substituents in p-type polymer donors to enhance their photovoltaic performance.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of the polymers
The monomers and polymers were prepared in accordance with Scheme 1, and the detailed synthetic process and analyses are outlined in the ESI.† First, the lithium–halogen exchange reaction between 4-bromo-1-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)-2-fluorobenzene (1) and 1,4-dimethylpiperazine-2,3-dione (2) was performed to produce the fluorinated α-diketone of 1,2-bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)-3-fluorophenyl)ethane-1,2-dione (3). Second, Zn-mediated reduction and condensation were consecutively performed with F- and CN-substituted 4,7-dibromo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole derivatives (4 and 5) with 3 to afford the target electron-accepting quinoxaline-based monomers 6 and 7, respectively. Additionally, as electron-donating monomers, the non-fluorinated and fluorinated BDT derivatives of (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)-bis(trimethylstannane) (8) and (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (9), respectively, were selected. Finally, the Stille polycondensation reaction between two BDT monomers (8 and 9) and two quinoxaline monomers (6 and 7) produced four different polymers. The combination of 8 and 9 with 6 afforded F-type polymers, PB-FQxF and PBF-FQxF, respectively. However, the polymerization of 8 and 9 with 7 under the same conditions afforded CN-type polymers, PB-FQxCN and PBF-FQxCN, respectively. These molecular design strategies can foster the uniqueness of polymer architectures and offer meaningful insight into the contribution of electron-withdrawing substituents to the photovoltaic features of polymers. The multiple alkyl and alkoxy chains render all polymers soluble in ordinary organic solvents. From gel permeation chromatography measurements, the number-average molecular weight (Mn) of the polymers was analyzed. The Mn values were 48.8, 55.8, 49.7, and 60.8 kDa for PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN, respectively, with polydispersity index values of 2.85, 2.89, 3.46, and 4.26, respectively. Additionally, the superb thermal stability of the polymers was confirmed by the high onset decomposition temperature of over 410 °C at a 5 wt% loss (Fig. S1, ESI†).

Optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers
In film state, all the polymers displayed two discrete ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption bands (Fig. 2a). The absorption bands at relatively short wavelengths (300–500 nm) and relatively long wavelengths (520–750 nm) stem from the π–π* transition and ICT formation of polymer backbones, respectively. Notably, the CN-type polymers, PB-FQxCN and PBF-FQxCN, exhibited more red-shifted ICT peaks at approximately 30 nm than their F-type counterparts, PB-FQxF and PBF-FQxF. These shifts can be ascribed to the enhanced ICT generation in the CN-type polymers upon the substitution of the F atom with the relatively stronger electron-attracting CN group. However, PBF-FQxF and PBF-FQxCN, possessing two F atoms on each of the two thienyl units in the BDT donor, exhibited slightly blue-shifted ICT peaks compared to the unfluorinated counterparts, PB-FQxF and PB-FQxCN. The attachment of additional F atoms on the BDT donor can reduce the energy level of the HOMO, thereby increasing the bandgaps of the polymers. The optical bandgaps of the polymers were determined from the film state UV-Vis absorption edges, and the values for PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN were 1.79, 1.81, 1.68, and 1.69 eV, respectively. Interestingly, the nonfullerene Y6 acceptor displayed strong light absorption in the relatively long wavelength region of 600–900 nm (Fig. 2a), which is complementary to those of PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN. In the chloroform solution, two similar absorption peaks were obtained from all polymers, and the molar extinction coefficients of PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN in the ICT region were determined to be 6.78 × 104, 7.76 × 104, 6.90 × 104, and 7.10 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 2b).

Additionally, cyclic voltammetry (CV) evaluations were conducted, and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, after calibration with a ferrocene standard. The HOMO/LUMO values for PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN were −5.04/−3.09, −5.08/−3.12, −5.17/−3.36, and −5.26/−3.37 eV, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). Therefore, the incorporation of additional F atoms on the BDT donor or substitution of F atoms with CN groups on the quinoxaline acceptor can diminish the energy levels of the polymers efficiently.33–36 All analytical results obtained from UV-vis and CV measurements are presented in Table 1. Fortunately, the facile charge dissociation and migration process of the fabricated devices were confirmed using the electronic band structures of the polymers (Fig. 2c).

Theoretical calculation
A density-functional theory (DFT) study was conducted on the two-repeating model using the Gaussian 16 program at the B3LYP/6-31G** level.37 For reducing the computational load, the existing 2-ethylhexyl and 2-ethylhexyloxy chains were downsized to the simplest methyl and methoxy units, respectively. Interestingly, the torsional angles between the thiophene bridge and adjacent quinoxaline units of the two-repeating models in CN-type PB-FQxCN (41.2°) and PBF-FQxCN (41.1°) were considerably larger than those in F-type PB-FQxF (16.7°) and PBF-FQxF (16.3°) in the optimized geometries (Fig. 3). Compared with the small F atom, the bulkier CN group on the quinoxaline unit can induce strong steric hindrance, affording a considerably tilted conformation.38 In the electron density plots, the wave functions of the HOMO and LUMO were confined to the electron-donating and electron-accepting units, respectively. Notably, the CN-type models exhibited more localized LUMO wave functions on the quinoxaline unit than their fluorine-type counterparts. Therefore, the LUMO energy levels of the model compounds were considerably changed by the substitution of the F atoms with the CN group on the quinoxaline unit. Additionally, the computed energy levels of the LUMO/HOMO of the two-repeating models representing PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN were −2.47/−4.73 eV, −2.56/−4.86 eV, −2.67/−4.87 eV, and −2.75/−5.01 eV, respectively. The theoretical energy levels of the two repeating models exhibit a trend similar to that of the experimentally obtained energy levels of the polymers.

Photovoltaic properties
An inverted-type device with ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag was manufactured to measure the photovoltaic characteristics of the polymers. The blend ratios of the polymers and Y6 in the BHJ active layer of the device were optimized at 1:1.5 (w/w) (Table S1 in the ESI†). Additionally, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was adopted as a processing agent, and its concentration was optimized at 1.0 vol% (Table S2 in ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs under the best conditions are displayed in Fig. 3, and their detailed parameters are outlined in Table 2. The PCEs of the devices were highly susceptible to the presence and types of electron-attracting moieties on the polymer structures. Notably, there are two methods for increasing the photovoltaic performances of the polymers: (i) the attachment of F atoms on two thienyl units of the BDT donor and (ii) the substitution of F atom with the CN group at the 5-position of the quinoxaline acceptor. For instance, the PCEs of the devices with PBF-FQxF (8.98%) and PB-FQxCN (11.46%) became superior to those of the devices with the PB-FQxF reference (6.77%). These enhancements can be originated from the prompt increase in VOC and fill factor (FF) of the devices. The F atoms and CN units on the two thiophene units of the BDT donor in PBF-FQxF and the 5-position of the quinoxaline acceptor in PB-FQxCN can efficiently lower the energy levels of the HOMO, leading to the enhanced VOC values of the devices. Furthermore, the device based on PBF-FQxCN, in which F atoms and CN groups were simultaneously introduced to the BDT donor and quinoxaline acceptor, respectively, exhibited the highest PCE of 12.11%. Therefore, molecular design strategies by controlling the number and types of electron-withdrawing substituents were proven to have affirmative and synergistic contributions to the photovoltaic features of the polymers. Furthermore, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices were analyzed, and all devices showed excellent photon-to-current conversion efficiency in the wide range of 350–900 nm (Fig. 4b). In particular, the devices based on the CN-type polymers, PB-FQxCN and PBF-FQxCN, showed enhanced EQE values in the relatively longer wavelength range of 600–800 nm compared to those based on the F-type polymers, PB-FQxF and PBF-FQxF. Increased EQEs of more than 75% were achieved for the devices with PB-FQxCN and PBF-FQxCN, affording excellent JSC values, higher than 25 mA cm−2.

The space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were carried out to investigate the charge-transporting features of the polymers.39 Hole-only and electron-only devices with an arrangement of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al, respectively, were manufactured and tested. The resultant J–V characteristics are summarized in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† The hole mobilities (μh) of PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN were determined to be 4.38 × 10−5, 4.19 × 10−5, 3.45 × 10−5, and 2.88 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Interestingly, the μh values decreased in the following order: PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN. Conversely, the values of electron mobilities (μe) exhibited the opposite trend, and they were gradually improved in the order of 0.76 × 10−5, 2.16 × 10−5, 2.28 × 10−5, and 2.97 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN, respectively. Therefore, the resultant μh/μe ratios for the devices with PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN were determined to be 5.7, 1.9, 1.5, and 0.97, respectively. Therefore, it has been proven that the attachment of relatively strong electron-attracting moieties on the quinoxaline-based polymers resulted in more balanced μh/μe ratios, leading to improved FF and PCE. Additionally, the dynamics of charge recombination properties were examined through light-dependent VOC and JSC measurements. First, the relationship between the light intensity (Plight) and VOC was plotted using the following formula: VOC = (nkT/q) × ln(Plight), where k, T, and q represent the Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature, and elementary charge, respectively.40 As shown in Fig. 4c, the devices based on PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN displayed n values of 1.23, 1.14, 1.00, and 1.05, respectively. A relatively small n value indicates a less trap-assisted recombination process. Second, the correlation between Plight and JSC was evaluated using the following equation: JSC = (Plight)α.41 As shown in Fig. 4d, the α values of the PSCs with PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN were 0.96, 0.95, 0.97, and 0.99, respectively. The bimolecular recombination process can be less prominent when α approaches 1.42 From these results, it was found that the incorporation of F atoms and CN groups in the BDT donor and quinoxaline acceptor, respectively, could efficiently suppress undesirable trap-assisted and bimolecular recombination processes. These reduced recombination losses can increase the FF and PCE of these devices efficiently.
Molecular ordering and morphological characteristics
The molecular arrangements and morphological features of the polymers and their blends were investigated by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. First of all, the generation of a favorable face-on orientation in both the pristine and blended films was confirmed using all the GIWAXS images (Fig. 5a and b).43,44 Additionally, the π–π stacking peaks of neat polymer films in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction were observed at 1.64, 1.66, 1.62, and 1.65 Å−1 for PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN, respectively, relevant to the π–π stacking lengths of 3.82, 3.79, 3.89, and 3.82 Å, respectively (Fig. 5c). According to the DFT calculations, the CN-type polymers, PB-FQxCN and PBF-FQxCN, exhibited a more tilted conformation compared to their F-type counterparts, PB-FQxF and PBF-FQxF, owing to the increased steric hindrance originating from the relatively large CN moiety. Therefore, the pristine films of PB-FQxCN and PBF-FQxCN exhibited longer π–π stacking distances compared to those of PB-FQxF and PBF-FQxF. Moreover, the π–π stacking distances of BHJ films blended with the polymers and Y6 became shorter than those of the neat polymer films. From the line-cut profiles depicted in Fig. 5d, the blended films based on PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN showed the π–π stacking distances of 3.62, 3.63, 3.62, and 3.64 Å, respectively. Similar to the pristine films, the BHJ films maintained the face-on orientation and showed relatively strong diffraction patterns of π–π stacking in the OOP direction. Although the BHJ films with all polymers displayed similar π–π stacking distances, there were significant differences in their crystallinity. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values in the π–π stacking peaks of the blended films based on PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN were 0.39, 0.31, 0.31, and 0.28 Å−1, respectively (Table S3 in the ESI†). Considering the FWHM results for all blend films, the coherence length (CCL) of all BHJ films was calculated using the following equation: 2π/FWHM,45 and the results are collected in Table S3 (ESI†). The relatively low FWHM values afforded relatively high CCL values, thereby enhancing long-range lamellar packing in the blended films. These results are consistent with the GIWAXS images shown in Fig. 5b. In addition, the surface morphological images of the blended films obtained by AFM measurements are shown in Fig. 5e. All blended films showed similar smooth and regular surfaces. The calculated root-mean-square (RMS) roughness in the blended films of PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN was 0.83, 0.86, 1.01, and 1.20 nm, respectively. The RMS roughness gradually increased in the following order: PB-FQxF, PBF-FQxF, PB-FQxCN, and PBF-FQxCN. The increase in the RMS roughness of the blended films can be originated from the long-range lamellar ordering, as shown in the GIWAX results. Therefore, the introduction of the F atom and CN groups to the BDT donor and quinoxaline acceptor, respectively, can increase the crystal size and long-range ordering in the blended films, thereby promoting the charge-transport characteristics of the devices.

Conclusion
In summary, four quinoxaline-based D–A-type polymers with different populations and types of electron-attracting substituents were synthesized to develop high-performance p-type donors for nonfullerene PSCs. First, the reference polymer, PB-QxF, was prepared by combining electron-donating BDT and electron-accepting quinoxaline monomers. Subsequently, two molecular design strategies for attaching additional F atoms to the thienyl units of the BDT donor and replacing the F atom with CN units on the quinoxaline acceptor were individually obtained using the structure of PB-QxF to afford the target polymers, PBF-QxF and PB-QxCN, respectively. Finally, the two approaches were simultaneously adopted to produce another target polymer, PBF-QxCN. These structural alternations can induce considerable changes in the optical, electrochemical, and morphological characteristics of the polymers. Additionally, inverted-type devices were manufactured to explore the photovoltaic characteristics of the polymers. Notably, the efficiencies of the polymers were progressively improved in the following order: PB-FQxF (6.77%), PBF-FQxF (8.98%), PB-FQxCN (11.46%), and PBF-FQxCN (12.11%). The HOMO energy level of PBF-FQxF with two more F atoms on the BDT donor was more stabilized than that of the PB-FQxF reference, and the VOC and PCE of the corresponding PSCs were enhanced. Similarly, the efficiency of the device with PB-FQxCN was considerably superior to that of the device with the PB-FQxF reference owing to the remarkable growth in the VOC and FF. This enhancement was attributed to the deeper HOMO energy level and enhanced charge-transport properties of PB-FQxCN. Owing to the synergistic contributions of the F and CN substituents on the BDT donor and quinoxaline acceptor, respectively, the best PCE of 12.11% with a JSC of 25.64 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.76 V, and a FF of 62.27% was achieved from the device with PBF-FQxCN. Overall, this study can provide in-depth knowledge of the structure–property correlations of conjugated polymers and promising molecular design strategies for developing p-type donors for nonfullerene PSCs.
