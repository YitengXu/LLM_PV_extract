    , Accepted 30th April 2014First published on 1st May 2014AbstractThe inorganic–organic perovskite (CH3NH3)PbBr3, which is potentially important in photovoltaics, has been deposited using aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD).
Solid state solar absorbers such as tin sulfide (SnS),1 copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS)2,3 and copper indium gallium sulfide (CIGS),4 which show excellent absorption characteristics over the solar radiation spectrum, are potentially cheaper to produce than silicon-based photovoltaic devices and potentially can give power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) commensurate with planetary demand, representing good candidates for next generation solar cells, with the full potential of these materials not yet realized. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), popularized by Grätzel and co-workers5 currently show PCEs of 10–15%,6 but have also suffered problems with their reproducibility and long-term use.7 Quantum dots have also been investigated as light harvesting materials for solar cells and show great promise through multiple exciton generation phenomena as well as the ability to tune the absorption wavelength by using quantum confinement effects.8–10
Inorganic–organic perovskites (IOPs) such as (CH3NH3)PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have recently attracted considerable interest as an absorbing layer for solar energy conversion applications.11,12 (CH3NH3)PbBr3 adopts the classic inorganic perovskite structure (ABX3) with a cubic arrangement of eight CHNH3+ cations with face-centering by six Br− anions, and a lead(II) ion positioned at the centre of the unit cell (Fig. 1). The visible light sensitization properties of IOPs were first reported by Miyasaka and co-workers, with PCEs in a solar cell containing the IOP deposited onto TiO2 of ca. 3–4%. Recent PCEs for IOP perovskite sensitised solar cells reported by Grätzel and co-workers and Snaith and co-workers are ca. 15%.13,14 In the latter study mixed-halide perovskites ((CH3NH3)PbI3−xClx) were deposited by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) onto TiO2 substrates under high vacuum from dual organic (CH3NH3I) and inorganic (PbCl2) sources. Bisquert and co-workers have recently highlighted that IOPs perform equally as well whether deposited on nanostructured substrates or as thin films.15 Kanatzidis and co-workers have recently replaced the Pb(II) centres with Sn(II) centres.16 Due to their salient properties for solar energy conversion, including step-change PCEs that are still relatively un-optimised combined with their inexpensive and earth-abundant constituent elements, IOPs have been rightly heralded as a potential ‘game-changer’ in sustainable photovoltaics.6

In this communication we report the deposition of thin films of an IOP, (CH3NH3)PbBr3 onto glass substrates using aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) from a single precursor solution. AACVD has attracted attention as it is an ambient-pressure CVD technique that uses nebulization of precursor molecules, followed by transport of the aerosol by an inert carrier gas such as argon to a substrate surface where thermal decomposition of the precursor occurs. AACVD has been used for the deposition of various semiconductors including MoS2,17 SnS1,18 and CZTS.2 AACVD is a very attractive deposition technique as it occurs under ambient pressure, the apparatus required is relatively simple and inexpensive and amongst the range of CVD techniques available it has very good potential for scale-up.19 Furthermore it requires precursors with only moderate volatility, extending the range of molecules that can be employed for the deposition of thin films. To the best of our knowledge, AACVD has never been used for the deposition of IOP thin films.
The lead(II) precursor (CH3NH3)PbBr3 was prepared by reaction of methylamine with hydrobromic acid followed by crystallization of the hydrobromide salt, CH3NH3Br by reduction of the volume in vacuo. Lead(II) bromide (PbBr2) was then mixed in stoichiometric ratio with the methylamine hydrobromide in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and heated at 60 °C for 2 hours.20 The DMF solution is then diluted tenfold with acetonitrile (minor precipitation was observed here, solids were removed). The diluted precursor solution is then nebulized using a commercial humidifier and the aerosol is carried into a hot tube furnace (250 °C) containing a glass substrate by a stream of argon (200 sccm). Thermal decomposition of the precursor on the substrate occurs to leave a striking yellow-orange film of (CH3NH3)PbBr3. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements on the as-deposited film gave major diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.77° and 29.98° (Fig. 1) corresponding to the (100), and (200) planes of a cubic perovskite unit cell (Pmm) with a lattice constant of 5.9 Å, as expected and consistent with previous work with solution deposited material.11,21 In addition to this minor Bragg reflections from the (110), (111), (210) (220), (300) and (321) planes were observed, thus confirming the crystalline nature of the deposited (CH3NH3)PbBr3.
The morphology of the as-deposited films was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. 2), with images taken in secondary electron mode at 6 keV. Wide-field SEM images show a uniform coating of (CH3NH3)PbBr3 across the glass substrate, comparable in uniformity to such IOPs as deposited by high-vacuum CVD.14 Images taken at higher magnification revealed the crystalline appearance of the perovskite on the glass. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) of the film as-imaged revealed a Pb:Br atomic ratio of around 1:3 as expected for (CH3NH3)PbBr3. The consistent coating of the sample across an interrogation area of ca. 25 × 25 μm was confirmed by quantitative EDX mapping at 25 keV (Fig. 3); the distribution of both Pb and Br is uniform over the interrogated area at a resolution of ca. 1 μm.

The scale bar corresponds to 50 μm. (B) Image taken at 6 keV, 8000 × magnification revealing the crystalline appearance of deposited (CH3NH3)PbBr3. The scale bar corresponds to 2 μm. 
 Fig. 3  EDX (25 keV) Q-maps demonstrating the uniform coverage of (CH3NH3)PbBr3 films over a region of interest of ca. 25 × 25 μm. All scale bars correspond to ca. 10 μm. Q-mapping of the Pb (Lβ, 10.6 keV) and Br (Kα, 11.9 keV) channels show a uniform coverage of both elements. Combination of the Pb and Br Q-maps overlayed with the secondary electron (SE) SEM image of the area generates a yellow colour revealing the co-localisation of both elements across the entire region. 
We have used aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) to produce films of the light-harvesting perovskite (CH3NH3)NH3Br3 on glass substrates. The use of AACVD to deposit such materials is an exciting development due to the simple apparatus required for AACVD combined with its great potential for scale-up, an essential requirement for any solution to the alternative energy question. The films produced by this method are comparable in quality to current methods used for deposition of IOPs such as spin coat – annealing and furthermore do not require high vacuum for their deposition.
