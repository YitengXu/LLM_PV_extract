    , Accepted 25th May 2012First published on 28th May 2012AbstractThe morphology, size and phase control of luminescent fluoride nanocrystals through doping has become a new research hotspot due to their improved properties. In this work, Yb3+ ions, as one of the most efficient sensitizers for various lanthanide activators, were doped in NaGd(Y)F4 nanocrystals. The results show that no obvious influence was observed for Yb3+-doped NaYF4 nanocrystals, while the influence of Yb3+ doping on NaGdF4 nanocrystals was remarkable. The NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals were synthesized by a hydrothermal route and had a morphology of rice-like nanorods. By controlling the synthesis parameters, the average size and slenderness of the nanocrystals increased gradually with addition of Yb3+ ions. In contrast, the NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals maintained a hexagonal phase, which is more beneficial for application as a luminescent host, until the content of Yb3+ ions reached x = 0.9. The growth and transformation mechanism of NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals was proposed to be a result of the competition between ion diffusion and an Oswald ripening process. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra confirm the efficient up-conversion and near-infrared (NIR) two-model luminescence properties of Er3+ (Tm3+) activated NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals. Simulated analysis results indicate that a colloidal solution of mixed luminescent nanocrystals is expected to find application as the activated medium of three dimensional displays and a broadband optical amplifier.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, nanocrystals activated by lanthanide ions (Ln3+, such as Er3+, Tm3+, Tb3+, etc.) have gained attention due to their applications in displays, bio-labels, solar cells, medical diagnosis, lasers, etc.1–41 Among the various nanocrystal hosts, fluoride nanocrystals (such as NaLnF4, CaF2, etc.) are considered to be excellent hosts for activators due to their low phonon energy, which can provide low non-radiative relaxation and high luminescence efficiency.3–47 NaLnF4 nanocrystals are usually prepared by a solvent–thermal process, due to the easy and controllable synthesis. It is well known that NaLnF4 nanocrystals have a two phase structure, i.e. a cubic (α) and a hexagonal (β) phase. Compared with the low-temperature cubic phase, hexagonal phase NaLnF4 nanocrystals can provide more intense luminescence for Ln3+ ions, especially for up-conversion emission.3 Therefore, phase, morphology and size control of NaLnF4 nanocrystals has recently become a research hotspot.3,20–23,37 In 2010, Wang and Liu et al. realized the cubic-to-hexagonal phase transition of NaYF4 nanocrystals by replacing the Y3+ ions in the NaYF4 nanocrystals with Gd3+ ions.3 First-principles calculations indicated that the influence of lanthanide doping on phase and size arises from a strong dependence on the size and dipole polarizability of the substitutional dopant ion. Chen and Wang et al. used transition metal doping to induce the cubic-to-hexagonal phase transition of NaYF4 nanocrystals, which improved the emission properties of Er3+/Yb3+-doped NaYF4 nanocrystals.21 Subsequently, the same group also doped alkaline-earth metals to induce the hexagonal-to-cubic phase transition of LnF3 nanocrystals with an ultrasmall size (∼7 nm).22 However, investigations on the influence of doping with Yb3+ ions, which are well known as one of the most efficient sensitizers for various Ln3+ ions, on the morphology, size and phase of NaLnF4 nanocrystals are scarce.
Herein, utilizing Yb3+ ions to replace Y3+ (Gd3+) ions in NaYF4 (NaGdF4) nanocrystals, the influence of Yb3+ ions doping on the phase and size of NaYF4 (NaGdF4) nanocrystals is investigated. No obvious influence is observed in Yb3+ ions doped NaYF4 nanocrystals, while the influence of NaGdF4 nanocrystals is remarkable. Using Er3+ and Tm3+ ions as the activator, the up-conversion and near-infrared (NIR) photoluminescence (PL) properties are investigated in detail.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of Er3+(Tm3+)-doped NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals
Er3+(Tm3+)-doped NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals were synthesized by a hydrothermal route. All of the chemicals were analytical grade reagents purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent (SCR) Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). In a typical preparation procedure for NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals, 1.2 g of NaOH and a total of 8 mL of Ln(NO3)3 (Ln = Gd, Yb, Er, Tm) (0.2 M) were added into 6 mL of de-ionized water to form a homogeneous aqueous solution. Then 20 mL of ethanol and 20 mL of oleic acid were added into the solution, respectively. After vigorous stirring for 10 min, 4 mL of NH4F (2 M) was introduced into the above solution. After further stirring for 20 min, the solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 2 h. The temperature schedule is illustrated in Fig. S1.† After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the resulting white emulsion was centrifugally separated with a rotator speed of 6000 rpm for 20 min, and washed with de-ionized water and ethanol, respectively. The white product was then ultrasonically dispersed in 5 mL of cyclohexane for morphology and PL measurements.
2.2 Preparation of Er3+(Tm3+)-doped NaY1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals
Er3+(Tm3+)-doped NaY1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals were synthesized by a hydrothermal route that was similar to the preparation of NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals. Firstly, 1.8 g of NaOH and a total of 4.5 mL of Ln(NO3)3 (Ln = Y, Yb, Er, Tm) (0.2 M) were added into 14 mL of de-ionized water to form a homogeneous aqueous solution. Then 10 mL of ethanol and 30 mL of oleic acid were added into the solution, respectively. After vigorous stirring for 10 min, 4.5 mL of NaF (1 M) was introduced into the above solution. After further stirring for 20 min, the solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 8 h. The subsequent centrifugation and washing was the same as described in Section 2.1. Finally, the product was ultrasonically dispersed in 5 mL of cyclohexane for morphology and PL measurements.
2.3 Characterization
The crystal phase of NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals was determined by a Rigaku D/MAX X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with CuKα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The morphology, microstructure and size of the nanocrystals were investigated using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-100CXII) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM, LEO1530V). To further determine the microstructure and phase of nanocrystals, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were performed using a Philips-FEI transmission electron microscope. Up-conversion and NIR PL spectra of Er3+(Tm3+)-doped NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals were performed on a Triax 320 (Jobin Yvon, France) fluorescence spectrofluorometer. A 980 nm laser diode (LD) was used as the excitation resource. All the measurements were performed at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and phase control of NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals
For both NaGdF4 and NaYbF4, two phases exist, i.e. the α-phase and β-phase. XRD patterns of NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals are illustrated in Fig. 1. For the NaGdF4 nanocrystals synthesized at 200 °C for 2 h, the as-prepared products are pure β-phase NaGdF4. The bandwidth of diffraction peaks is relatively wide, which indicates that the NaGdF4 nanocrystals are small. After the substitution of Gd3+ ions by Yb3+ ions in NaGdF4 nanocrystals, NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals remain as the β-phase even when the content of Yb3+ ions reaches x = 0.9. However, the diffraction peaks become narrower and sharper and the split of the diffraction peaks is clearer, which indicates that Yb3+-substituted NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals are larger and have better crystallinity. After careful examination of the XRD patterns, it can be seen that the diffraction intensity ratio of the (110) to (101) crystal facets increases with increasing amounts of Yb3+ ions from x = 0 to x = 0.6. This is probably due to the anisotropic growth along the [0001] direction (c-axis) of β-phase NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals. Furthermore, with the addition of Yb3+ ions, the diffraction peaks gradually shift towards the high angle side, which can be ascribed to the substitution of Gd3+ ions (r = 0.094 nm) by the smaller Yb3+ ions (r = 0.086 nm). The XRD results confirm that Yb3+ ions have been incorporated into the NaGd1−xYbxF4 crystal lattice and form a solid solution phase. For the NaYbF4 nanocrystals synthesized at the same conditions, it is noticeable that the products consist of almost pure α-phase NaYbF4. That indicates that the NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals can conveniently transform from the α-phase to the β-phase after the substitution of only 10% Yb3+ ions by Gd3+ ions, which is easier than the phase transformation of NaGd1−xYxF4 nanocrystals.3 From the XRD results in Fig. 1, it can be seen that the size and phase of NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals can be tuned by substitution of Yb3+ ions and Gd3+ ions. To clearly confirm the above results, TEM (HRTEM) and SEM images were performed and are discussed in the following text.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals. (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.3, (c) x = 0.6, (d) x = 0.8, (e) x = 0.9, (f) x = 1.0. 

Fig. 2 show the TEM images of NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals with the substitution of Yb3+ ions. For the undoped NaGdF4 nanocrystals in Fig. 2(a), the morphology is a rice-like polygon. The size is relatively uniform and almost mono-dispersed. The average size of length and width is ∼25 nm and ∼15 nm, respectively. Fig. 3(b) shows a HRTEM image of a single NaGdF4 nanocrystal. A series of crystal facets with a space of 0.521 nm are clearly observed, which agrees well with the (100) crystal facet of β-phase NaGdF4. The addition of Yb3+ ions as x = 0.1 and x = 0.3 can be seen in the TEM images of nanocrystals in Fig. 2(b) and (c), respectively. It can be seen that the width of the nanocrystals slightly increases, while the length of nanocrystals significantly increases. The average size and slenderness of the nanocrystals increases remarkably with the substitution of Gd3+ ions by Yb3+ ions. When the content of Yb3+ ions further increases to x = 0.5–0.6, the average size and slenderness of the nanocrystals increases further. However, the rice-like nanocrystals exhibit noticeable aggregation and self-assembled characteristics. When the addition of Yb3+ ions reaches x = 0.7, the morphology of the nanocrystals becomes a single nanorod again, and the length and width are 200–250 nm and 40–50 nm, respectively. The further addition of Yb3+ ions to x = 0.8 and x = 0.9 seems to improve the crystallinity of NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals, while the morphology and size are only slightly modified. Fig. 3(c) shows a HRTEM image of a single NaGd0.1Yb0.9F4 nanorod, and it can be seen that the nanorod is a single crystal. The space of the crystal facets was measured to be 0.515 nm, which is consistent with the (100) crystal facet (d = 0.513 nm) of β-phase NaYbF4. The slight increase of the d value is ascribed to the 10% substitution of Gd3+ ions with larger radius. The Fourier transform and SAED patterns taken from the side face of single NaGd0.1Yb0.9F4 nanorods are illustrated in Fig. 3(d) and (e), which further confirms that the nanorod is a β-phase NaGd0.1Yb0.9F4 single crystal. The NaYbF4 nanocrystals synthesized at the same conditions are nanocubes with an average size of ∼15 nm, due to the α-phase characteristics of nanocrystals. SEM images of NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals are also illustrated in Fig. S2,† which is consistent with the TEM results.

Based on the TEM and SEM results, the growth and transformation mechanism of NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals substituted with Yb3+ ions is illustrated in Fig. 4. During synthesis at 200 °C for 2 h in the Teflon autoclave, the undoped NaGdF4 nanocrystals are rice-like polygons. When Gd3+ ions are substituted by Yb3+ ions (x = 0.1–0.4), the nanocrystals change into more slender nanorods. From previous works, it can be deduced that lanthanide (Ln3+) ions with a larger radius have a lower energy barrier to form larger and more slender hexagonal β-phase nanocrystals,3,37 which may be elucidated by the first principle calculations proposed by Wang and Liu et al.3 The larger the radius of the Ln3+ ions, the higher the electron charge density on the surface of the nanocrystals. When Gd3+ ions are substituted by Yb3+ ions with a smaller radius, the decreased surface electron charge density facilitates diffusion of the negative F− ions towards NaGd1−xYbxF4 crystal nuclei, which will accelerate the growth of the nanocrystals. When the content of Yb3+ ions reaches x = 0.5–0.6, the diffusion of F− ions and the growth of nanocrystals is more rapid. At the later stage of the synthesis process in the autoclave, the nanocrystals cannot grow through an ion diffusion mechanism due to exhaustion of F− ions and Ln3+ ions. To lower the surface energy, the NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanorods aggregate and self-assemble together. The nanorods have a tendency to go on growing through an Oswald ripening process. When the content of Yb3+ ions exceeds x = 0.7, due to the faster exhaustion of F− ions and Ln3+ ions, the NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanorods have adequate time and energy to complete the Oswald ripening process and form nanorods that are larger and more slender. Based on the above discussion, it can be deduced that the NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals first grow through an accelerated ion diffusion process at the beginning of the Yb3+ ions doping. After the continual addition of Yb3+ ions, the nanocrystals go on growing mainly through the Oswald ripening process due to the exhaustion of F− ions and Ln3+ ions.

Herein, we also investigate the effect of Yb3+-substitution on the morphology and phase of NaY1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals. Fig. 5 shows TEM images of NaY1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals with the addition of Yb3+ ions. For the NaYF4, NaY0.5Yb0.5F4, NaY0.1Yb0.9F4, and NaYbF4 nanocrystals synthesized at the same conditions, no obvious morphology transformation is observed in Fig. 2(i) and 5(a–c). All of the products are nanocubes with an average size of ∼15 nm. To further confirm the phase characteristics of NaY1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals, XRD patterns of NaYF4 and NaYbF4 nanocrystals are illustrated in Fig. 6. It can be seen that all the diffraction peaks are assigned to α-phase NaY(Yb)F4, and no extra diffraction peaks are observed. Only a slight shift of diffraction peaks is observed, which is due to the substitution of Yb3+ (r = 0.086 nm) ions by larger Y3+ ions (r = 0.089 nm). Based on the TEM and XRD results, it can be deduced that no obvious morphology and phase transformation occurs in NaY1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals substituted with Yb3+ ions, which is probably because of the similar radius and electron charge density characteristics between Y3+ and Yb3+ ions.

3.2 Up-conversion luminescence properties of Er3+(Tm3+)-doped NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals
It is well known that NaLnF4 is one of the most efficient hosts for luminescence activators, especially for up-conversion. Herein, using Er3+ and Tm3+ ions as the activators, we investigate the up-conversion and near-infrared (NIR) luminescence of Er3+(Tm3+)-doped NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals.

Fig. 7 shows the up-conversion luminescence spectra of Er3+-doped NaY1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals. Four obvious emission peaks centered at 405 nm, 520 nm, 540 nm and 655 nm are detected, which are assigned to the transitions of 2H9/2–4I15/2, 2H11/2–4I15/2, 4S3/2–4I15/2 and 4F9/2–4I15/2 of Er3+ ions, respectively.46,47 With the addition of Yb3+ ions in the nanocrystal host, the predominant emission peak is red (655 nm). The ratio of the red emission to green (520 nm and 540 nm) and blue (405 nm) emission increases, while the blue emission gradually vanishes. This can be elucidated through the up-conversion luminescence mechanism of Er3+/Yb3+ ions. Fig. S3† illustrates the schematic energy level diagram of up-conversion luminescence of Er3+/Yb3+ ions. The 2H9/2, 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels (Er3+) can be populated by the energy transfer of 2F5/2–2F7/2 (Yb3+):4S3/2–4G11/2 (Er3+), 2F5/2–2F7/2 (Yb3+):4I11/2–4F7/2 (Er3+), and 2F5/2–2F7/2 (Yb3+):4I13/2–4F9/2 (Er3+), respectively. Therefore, it can be deduced that the emissions at 405 nm, 520 nm, 540 nm and 655 nm are three-, two-, two- and two-photon process, respectively. Choosing NaY0.49Yb0.5Er0.01F4 nanocrystals as the representative sample, the result can be confirmed by the log–log relationship between the up-conversion luminescence intensity and excitation power, as shown in Fig. S4.† Based on work reported previously,7,48 the Yb⋯Er interatomic distance decreases with the addition of Yb3+ ions in the NaLnF4 host, which will facilitate the back-energy-transfer from Er3+ ions to Yb3+ ions. The back-energy-transfer will suppress the population of 2H9/2, 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 excited levels, especially for the 2H9/2 level (405 nm) with higher energy. This explains why the red emission at 655 nm becomes the predominant emission peak as more Yb3+ ions are added in the nanocrystal host. For the NaGd1−xYbxF4 host, the up-conversion luminescence spectra of Er3+-doped NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals are shown in Fig. 8. With the addition of Yb3+ ions, up-conversion luminescence properties of Er3+ ions in NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals are similar to those in NaY1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals.

 Fig. 8  Up-conversion luminescence spectra of Er3+-doped NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals. 

Fig. 9 illustrates the up-conversion luminescence spectra of Tm3+-doped NaY1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals. The emission peaks centered at 450 nm, 475 nm, 645 nm, 695 nm and 720 nm are ascribed to the transitions of 1D2–3F4, 1G4–3H6, 1G4–3F4, 3F2–3H6 and 3F3–3H6 of Tm3+ ions, respectively. From the energy level diagram of up-conversion luminescence of Tm3+/Yb3+ ions in Fig. S3,† it can be found that the population of 1D2, 1G4, 3FJ and 3H5 excited energy levels occur through the energy transfer of 2F5/2–2F7/2 (Yb3+):1G4–1D2 (Tm3+), 2F5/2–2F7/2 (Yb3+):3H4–1G4 (Tm3+), 2F5/2–2F7/2 (Yb3+):3F4–3F2 (Tm3+), and 2F5/2–2F7/2 (Yb3+):3H6–3H5 (Tm3+), respectively. Therefore, it can be deduced that emissions at 450 nm, 475 nm, 645 nm, 695 nm and 720 nm are four-, three-, three-, two- and two-photon processes, respectively. Based on the log–log relationship between the up-conversion luminescence intensity and excitation power of NaY0.49Yb0.5Tm0.01F4 nanocrystals (Fig. S5†), the multi-photon process of the up-conversion emission is also confirmed through experiments. Furthermore, due to the large energy mismatch of 2F5/2–2F7/2 (Yb3+):1G4–1D2 (Tm3+), several works also considered that the population of the 1D2 level occurred via the cross relaxation process of 3F3–3H6 (Tm3+):3F3–1D2 (Tm3+). In this mechanism for the population of the 1D2 level, it can be deduced that the emission at 450 nm is a four-photon process. The up-conversion luminescence spectra of Tm3+-doped NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals are illustrated in Fig. 10, which are similar to those of Tm3+-doped NaY1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals in Fig. 9.

 Fig. 10  Up-conversion luminescence spectra of Tm3+-doped NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals. 
Considering the excellent green (520 nm, 540 nm) and red (655 nm) up-conversion luminescence of Er3+-doped NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals, and the blue (450 nm, 475 nm) up-conversion luminescence of Tm3+-doped NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals, it is clear that the multi-color up-conversion luminescence covered the entire visible region by fine tuning the composition. This highlights the potential application of Er3+(Tm3+)-doped NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals in three dimensional displays.49
3.3 Near-infrared (NIR) luminescence properties of Er3+(Tm3+)-doped NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals
Er3+ and Tm3+ ions have been confirmed as efficient activators for near-infrared (NIR) amplifiers and lasers. Herein, the NIR luminescence of Er3+(Tm3+)-doped NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals is investigated in detail, and the effect of nanocrystal size is also investigated. Fig. 11 shows the NIR luminescence spectra of Er3+-doped NaY1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals excited by a 980 nm LD, a noticeable emission peak centered at 1535 nm is detected, which is assigned to the typical 4I13/2–4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ions. With increased amounts of the Yb3+ sensitizer, the NIR emission increases significantly. As the content of Yb3+ sensitizer increases to x = 0.3, the integrated intensity of 1535 nm emission reaches a maximum. With further addition of the Yb3+ ions, the emission intensity gradually decreases. For the NIR luminescence spectra of Er3+-doped NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals, an intense NIR emission peak is detected at 1535 nm (Fig. 12), which is similar to those of Er3+-doped NaY1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals. However, the emission intensity is more intense than that of Er3+-doped NaY1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals, and the optimal composition is NaGd0.59Yb0.4 Er0.01F4 with a larger content of Yb3+ sensitizer (see Fig. S7†). It is probably due to the crystal phase and size effect of luminescent nanocrystals. From previous works,3,18–20 it can be deduced that a hexagonal NaYF4 host offers more efficient luminescent properties than a cubic NaYF4 host, which explains the more intense luminescent intensity of Er3+-doped NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals in Fig. S7.† In addition, larger hosts are confirmed to be beneficial to the luminescence properties of the nanocrystals due to their better crystallinity. From the crystal phase and morphology investigation of NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals in Fig. 1 and 2, it can de deduced that with addition of the Yb3+ sensitizer, the crystallinity and growth of the nanocrystals remarkably improves. This will extend the optimal content of Yb3+ sensitizer in Er3+-doped NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals up to x = 0.4. Therefore, both the increased luminescent intensity and the extension of optimal Yb3+ sensitizer content in Er3+-doped NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals can be explained through the size effect (crystallinity) of the nanocrystals.

 Fig. 12  Near-infrared (NIR) luminescence spectra of Er3+-doped NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals. 
Due to the efficient luminescent properties of activators in NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals host, we also investigate the NIR luminescence properties of Tm3+-doped NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals. Fig. 13 shows the NIR luminescence spectra of Tm3+-doped NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals under 980 nm excitation. As shown in Fig. S6,† due to the population of 3H4 energy level, a 1470 nm emission band is observed assigned to the 3H4–3F4 transition of Tm3+ ions. Subsequently, an emission band centered at 1800 nm is observed with the electrons going back to the 3H4 ground state. However, because the response region of the InGaAs detector is only 900–1650 nm, it is difficult to detect the entire emission band around 1800 nm. Therefore, only a sideband around 1600 nm is detected in Fig. 13. With the addition of Yb3+ in NaGd0.99−xYbxTm0.01F4 nanocrystals, the integrated intensity of 1800 nm emission increases monotonically up to x = 0.9. This is probably due to the efficient energy transfer from Yb3+ to Tm3+ ions. From previous reports,50,51 it is known that the integrated intensity of 1800 nm emission usually slightly decreases at higher Yb3+ concentrations, which is due to the Yb3+ → Yb3+ energy migration and back-energy-transfer of Tm3+ → Yb3+, i.e.2F5/2–2F7/2 (Yb3+):3H4–3H6 (Tm3+), as shown in Fig. S6.† However, for NaGd0.99−xYbxTm0.01F4 nanocrystals, the integrated intensity of 1800 nm emission increases monotonically with the addition of Yb3+ up to x = 0.9. This interesting phenomenon can be explained as follows: firstly, the Ln3+ ions (Tm3+, Yb3+, Gd3+) are regularly distributed in β-NaGdF4 lattice, and the shortest distance between two adjacent Ln3+ ions is estimated to be 0.4 nm. Due to the regular distribution in lattice and large distance between two adjacent Ln3+ ions, the Yb3+ → Yb3+ energy migration is much weaker than the previous studies in glass. Secondly, the energy of the 3H4 (Tm3+) and 2F5/2 (Yb3+) energy levels are about 12380 cm−1 and 10000 cm−1, respectively. Thus, the energy gap between the 3H4 (Tm3+) and 2F5/2 (Yb3+) energy levels is estimated to be ∼2380 cm−1, which indicates that the back-energy-transfer of Tm3+ → Yb3+ should include multiphonon assistant. For NaGd0.99−xYbxTm0.01F4 nanocrystals, the matrix phonon energy is as low as 400 cm−1, which indicates that the back-energy-transfer should include at least six phonons. Therefore, it can be deduced that the back-energy-transfer probability in NaGd0.99−xYbxTm0.01F4 nanocrystals is very low. In addition, just as for the NIR emission of NaGd0.99−xYbxEr0.01F4 nanocrystals, the size effect will extend the optimal content of Yb3+ sensitizer in NaGd0.99−xYbxTm0.01F4 nanocrystals. Based on the above discussion, it can be elucidated that the integrated intensity of the 1800 nm emission increases monotonically with the addition of Yb3+ in up to x = 0.9.

Based on the excellent stability of NaYF4 and NaGdF4 nanocrystals in cyclohexane, a liquid broadband optical amplifier is expected by the mechanical mixing of NaGd(Y)0.99−xYbxEr0.01F4 and NaGd(Y)0.99−xYbxTm0.01F4 nanocrystals. Before exploring the feasibility of the routine, we first discuss two scientific problems: luminescence quenching resulting from cross relaxation process etc. and transparence of the colloid solution.
For the luminescence quenching between different Ln3+ ions (such as Er3+ and Tm3+ ions), based on the Forster–Dexter theory, it can be deduced that the energy transfer rate, PD–A is mainly dependent on R,6 where R is the distance between donor and acceptor ions.52,53 Taking NaGdF4 as an example, the unit-cell parameters are a = b = c = 0.55 nm and a = 0.60 nm, c = 0.36 nm for cubic and hexagonal phase. The shortest distance between two adjacent Ln3+ ions is only about 0.4 nm for both phases, which will result in serious luminescence quenching due to the strong resonance energy transfer process. However, for the colloidal nanocrystal solution used in this work, the average distance between adjacent nanocrystals is far more than 5 nm even though the concentration of nanocrystals is as high as 10 wt%. At this distance, any luminescence quenching resulting from non-irradiative relaxation processes can be neglected.
Besides the luminescence quenching, the transparence of the colloid solution is also an important factor for their application as liquid optical amplifier. Based on the discrete particle approach, the turbidity s(p), which is equivalent to the absorption coefficient can be expressed as54,55 σ = (2/3)NVk4r3(nΔn)2,(1)where N is the particle number density, V is the volume, k = 2π/λ, r is the radius of particle, n is the refractive index of the particle, and Δn is the refractive index difference between the particle and the solvent. By controlling the synthesis process, the radius and volume of nanocrystals can be finely tuned. Simultaneously, by selecting a solution with a refractive index similar to the nanocrystals (n is around 1.52 for NaYF4 and NaGdF4 nanocrystals), such as cyclohexane (n = 1.43) and ethylene glycol (n = 1.43), the parameter (nΔn)2 can be remarkably reduced. Therefore, the transparence of the nanocrystals/cyclohexane colloid solution can be completely fulfilled.
After demonstrating the theoretical feasibility, we simulate the NIR luminescence spectra by the mechanical overlapping of the spectra of NaGd(Y)0.99−xYbxEr0.01F4 and NaGd(Y)0.99−xYbxTm0.01F4 nanocrystals cyclohexane solution. The NIR luminescence spectra of NaGd0.59Yb0.4Er0.01F4 and NaGd0.09Yb0.9Tm0.01F4 nanocrystals, which exhibit excellent luminescence properties, are illustrated in Fig. 14. The full width at half maximums (FWHM) are estimated to be 80 nm and 65 nm, respectively, which is ascribed to the intrinsic f–f transitions of rare-earth ions. However, by the mechanical overlapping of spectrum (1) and (2) with the ratio of (1):(2) = 1.15:1, the simulated NIR luminescence spectrum (3) shows a broad flat emission band, and the FWHM is as wide as 150 nm, which is expected to be applied as broad optical amplifier.

4. Conclusions
In summary, monodisperse NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route. After replacing Gd3+ (Y3+) ions in the nanocrystals with Yb3+ ions, the morphology, size and phase of NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals were investigated in detail. SEM and TEM results indicated that no obvious influence is observed of Yb3+ ions doped NaYF4 nanocrystals, while the influence on NaGdF4 nanocrystals is remarkable. The length (width) of NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanorods increased from 25 nm (15 nm) to 200–250 nm (40–50 nm) after doping Yb3+ ions from x = 0 to x = 0.9. XRD results confirmed that the NaGd1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals maintained their hexagonal phase until the content of Yb3+ ions reached x = 0.9. Utilizing Er3+ and Tm3+ ions as the activators, up-conversion and NIR luminescence properties were investigated systematically. The crystal phase and size effect on the luminescence properties of nanocrystals was also discussed, which indicated that better crystallinity and larger size is beneficial for the enhancement of luminescence intensity. Based on the excellent green (520 nm, 540 nm) and red (655 nm) up-conversion luminescence of Er3+- and the blue (450 nm, 475 nm) up-conversion luminescence of Tm3+-doped NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals, it can be deduced that the nanocrystals can be potentially applied in three dimensional displays. Furthermore, based on the NIR luminescence (1535 nm for Er3+, and 1470 nm, 1800 nm for Tm3+) from Er3+ (Tm3+)-doped NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals, simulated analysis results indicated that a mixed nanocrystal solution of Er3+ and Tm3+-doped NaGd(Y)1−xYbxF4 nanocrystals is expected to be a gain medium of liquid broadband optical amplifier.
