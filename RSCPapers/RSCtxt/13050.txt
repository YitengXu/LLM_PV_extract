Broader context
Thermal energy is one of the most abundant forms of energy. Approximately 90% of the world's energy consumption involves the generation or manipulation of thermal energy over a wide temperature range. A significant portion of this massive amount of thermal energy is being wasted without useful applications. The storage of excessive thermal energy ensures the persistent operation of the integrated system and offers promising potential in many domestic and industrial applications, and power generations. Among the numerous methods of thermal energy storage (TES), latent heat TES is one of the best suited technologies in terms of storage density, economic viability, and industrial maturity. Owing to these outstanding characteristics, latent heat TES materials and systems are extensively investigated to achieve sustainable energy goals. Herein, we review the potential benefits of latent heat TES for solar energy utilization, power storage, waste heat recovery, and thermal regulatory systems. We start by presenting fundamental technology underpinning these systems and then discuss the broad and critical role of TES followed by literature highlights. We hope our efforts will inspire and facilitate the TES community to design future energy systems to meet sustainable development goals.

1 Background
To counter the issues of increasing carbon dioxide emission and irreversible burning of fossil fuel energy reserves, scientists are continuously developing new energy generation, conversion, and storage methods. Significant interest has been focused on renewable energy conversion and storage methods in this regard owing to their green credentials and vast energy reserves.1 Wind, solar, geothermal, and hydrothermal technologies, for example, have been used to generate energy and electrical, thermal, and chemical methods, for example, have been used to store energy.2,3 Thermal energy is one of the most abundant forms of energy and is fundamental to many domestic and industrial applications. Currently, approximately 90% of the world's energy consumption involves the generation or manipulation of thermal energy over a wide temperature range.4 Nevertheless, less than 50% of the research published in the energy research community focuses on thermal energy. Therefore, an understanding of the fundamentals of thermal energy storage (TES) technologies and integrated systems is urgently required.5
The TES technologies include sensible heat storage (SHS), latent heat storage (LHS), and thermochemical heat storage (THS). SHS technology is based on a purely physical phenomenon that involves the storage or extraction of heat using the rise or fall in temperature within a storage medium. The amount of stored heat is determined by the product of the specific heat of the storage material, the mass of the storage material, and the range of the temperature swing. A large amount of storage material and enormous temperature swing required by SHS to store large amounts of thermal energy, which leads to significant thermal mass losses over a wide temperature range, make SHS systems thermodynamically inefficient. LHS technology relies on the reversible phase transition of the storage materials and offers a high thermal storage density within a narrow temperature range. Compared with SHS, LHS (via the phase transition process) exhibits a thermal storage density nearly four times higher under identical conditions (temperature range and volume/mass of storage material). The high volumetric energy storage density within a narrow temperature range reduces the overall system size and potential risks. THS technology relies on the storage and release of thermal energy through reversible chemical reactions or sorption processes. Among these storage methods, THS exhibits the highest energy storage density.6 Conversely, when considering the application of these storage methods, the reverse trend is followed. SHS technology has been developed for commercial applications, LHS technology is transitioning from laboratory research to the commercial scale, while THS technology is developing at the laboratory scale. Therefore, LHS is the best-suited technology considering both energy storage capacity and system maturity. The performance metrics of LHS systems depend on the materials integrated within them.
2 Fundamentals of phase change materials
Phase change materials (PCMs) are a specialized class of materials that go through a reversible phase transition upon thermal action and are capable of storing and releasing a large amount of latent heat within a defined temperature range. The most commonly used PCMs are solid-to-liquid – water being the simplest example.7 In the water/ice system, the reversible breaking and formation of hydrogen bonds are responsible for the storage and release of thermal energy, respectively. In ice, the decreased molecular motion makes the hydrogen bonding more rigid and stronger than in that of liquid water. Under heating, the rigid bonds break and a phase transition of ice from the solid to liquid phase occurs (Fig. 1a). Upon the solid-to-liquid phase transition, approximately 330 J g−1 of heat energy is reversibly stored and released. The phase transition temperature of the water/ice system is fixed at 0 °C, which makes it unsuitable for the majority of real-life applications. A large variety of PCMs have been developed that freeze and melt in a similar way to the water/ice system, with their phase transition temperatures covering the range from sub-zero to approximately 1000 °C.8 In LHS applications, PCM charging is realized by transferring thermal energy to the PCM through conventional heat transfer mechanisms such as conduction, convection, and radiation. Under thermal charging, the PCMs first behave like SHS materials during which heat is stored following a temperature rise; however, when the melting point is reached, the temperature stabilizes and the energy is stored as latent heat from the melting process (Fig. 1b and c). After melting is complete, further thermal action results in a temperature rise similar to sensible storage. Upon cooling of a charged (melted) PCM, when the temperature reaches the freezing point, the PCM begins to freeze and releases an amount of latent heat approximatey equal to the melting process. The melting and freezing points of PCMs dictate the applications for which they are suitable. In this regard, a variety of organic and inorganic PCMs and their mixtures have been explored (Fig. 2a). The comparative characteristics of these PCMs are presented in Fig. 2b.

 Fig. 2  (a) The fundamental classification of PCMs. (b) The comparative characteristics of chosen PCMs. (c) Working temperature versus enthalpy master plot of different classes of PCMs and their proposed applications. 
Organic PCMs are long-chain macromolecules (with a few exceptions) primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen. Generally, these materials allow simple operation and use in low to mid-temperature range applications (<200 °C). Examples of such PCMs include paraffin waxes, fatty alcohols, fatty acids, polymers, sugar alcohols, and plastic crystals. Among these, paraffin waxes are the most widely studied PCMs owing to their high LHS capacity and phase transition temperature within an appropriate temperature range. Considering the operational temperature range, these PCMs are suitable for use in thermal management, solar heat storage, and waste heat recovery-based applications (Fig. 2c). The main challenges associated with paraffin-based PCMs are their low thermal conductivity, flammability, thermal instability, and expense due to non-renewable production sources. Fatty acids and alcohols exhibit a similar trend to paraffin waxes with respect to temperature range and storage enthalpy; however, these PCMs are biocompatible meaning they are suitable for biomedical applications. Among all the PCMs, sugar alcohols have the highest transition temperature and LHS capacity, which makes them ideal candidates for solar water heating and waste heat storage-related applications. Large supercooling is the main drawback of sugar alcohol-based PCMs. Plastic crystals are a subclass of sugar alcohols that have recently gained renewed attention owing to smart features such as stimuli-controlled phase transition and solid-state processing. Polymeric PCMs such as polyethylene and polyethylene glycols are examples of low-cost and functionalizable PCMs, which respectively correspond to mid and low-temperature range applications. Collectively, organic PCMs suffer from low thermal conductivity (∼0.2 W m−1 K−1) and shape instability, which decreases their effectiveness in energy storage systems. Both plastic crystal and some polymeric PCMs exhibit solid-to-solid phase transitions and do not require additional encapsulation.
The inorganic PCM family includes water, salt hydrates, molten salts, metals, and metal alloys. These PCMs cover a wide transition temperature range (Fig. 2c). They include water at 0 °C, salt hydrates in the mid-temperature range (5–130 °C), molten salts at temperatures above 150 °C and metals and metal alloys at temperatures up to 1500 °C. In low-temperature range applications (10–100 °C), where the melting point of inorganic PCMs overlaps with that of organic PCMs, salt hydrates suffer from supercooling issues and are not likely utilized. However, for mid-temperature applications, these materials become the primary choice of PCM. Other intrinsic challenges associated with inorganic PCMs are phase separation, corrosion, and liquid leakage. To overcome these and introduce additional functionalities, several material design approaches have been reported. These approaches have been summarized by our group and others to provide a deep understanding of material fabrication processes.9–14 To the best of our knowledge, a systematic review outlining the current and potential applications of PCMs as LHS media in advanced sustainable energy systems does not exist in the literature. Herein, we comprehensively review the broad and critical role of LHS in the context of sustainable energy solutions.
3 Overview of LHS for sustainable energy systems
A wide array of LHS technologies applied in diverse energy systems including solar-thermal storage, electric-thermal storage, waste heat storage and thermal regulation of buildings, textiles and other smart devices have been reported (Fig. 3). In solar-thermal energy storage systems, sunlight is stored as heat that is then utilized to heat water and space and for electric power generation. Low to mid-temperature range (70–120 °C) latent heat is stored for water heating-related applications and high-temperature LHS (250–800 °C) is utilized in solar-thermal power plants. The LHS enables a higher storage density within smaller storage areas in water heating systems and higher power generation efficiency in power plants. The electric power utilization systems include electric heating and cooling systems and grid energy storage systems. In the electric heating and cooling systems, the off-peak electric power charges the system for operation during peak hours. This off-peak electricity storage is not only cost-effective but also grid reliable. Moreover, owing to the high energy storage density, high cyclic stability and low-cost features, LHS systems are also installed in location-independent, grid-scale power storage applications. In grid storage applications, heat engine coupled LHS systems operate reversible electricity storage in the form of power–heat–power, which can then be extracted as required. The round-trip efficiency of power storage systems can be maximized by reducing energy losses using right-to-left and left-to-right handed thermodynamic cycles. Further, low to the high-temperature range, LHS has significant potential in waste heat recovery systems. Owing to heat-to-heat interactions, a high energy recovery efficiency is achieved in latent heat integrated waste heat recovery systems. In addition, the issue of intermittent heat supply and demand is mitigated using LHS coupling. Furthermore, the isothermal phase transition of PCMs offers diverse applications in thermal management of buildings, electronic devices, chemical reactors, temperature-sensitive products, the human body, and smart devices.15–21 The capabilities of LHS include a reversible response to temperature fluctuation allowing maintenance within a certain range. Low-temperature PCMs, especially organic-based PCMs with phase transitions in the range of 10–60 °C, have been most widely studied for thermal management applications. In this article, the LHS systems are organized into four categories and each is discussed in detail.

4 Solar-thermal energy storage and utilization
Solar energy storage using PCM latent heat is an operationally simple and economically feasible technology that offers renewable energy options in a wide range of applications. However, the limited solar absorbance and high reflectance of neat PCMs require the addition of a photo-absorber dopant to allow efficient harvesting of broadband solar energy. In this regard, past efforts have been made to incorporate several kinds of photo-thermal dopants including plasmonic particles (e.g. Au, Ag, and Pt)22–24 semiconductors23,25–29 (e.g. Ti4O7, CuO, Cu2O, and black phosphorus),23,25–29 and molecular materials (e.g. organic dyes, conjugated polymers, and carbon nanostructures).30–35 For doped PCMs, a >90% solar-to-thermal storage efficiency can be achieved, which is a substantial increase in comparison to other solar conversion processes.36 Solar-thermal energy storage offers enormous potential for heating, cooling, and electricity generation technologies. In the following sections, we explore the competitive benefits of solar-thermal energy storage for water heating and dispatchable power generation.
4.1 Solar water heating
The effective use of solar energy in water heating systems is often limited by intermittent operation. The incorporation of PCM-based TES units into solar water heating (SWH) systems is a necessary step to overcome this issue. TES allows the SWH system to fill the gap between solar energy supply and demand. Based on the design, SWH systems can be categorized into flat plate solar collectors and evacuated tube solar collectors; the PCM can be incorporated within the collector structure or as a separate storage tank. During basic operation, the solar collector absorbs solar radiation and generates energy in the form of heat, which is transferred through the TES medium to heat the water. The fundamental process of PCM-integrated SWH systems is solar-thermal energy storage and supply that facilitates 24-hour operation. To allow the storage of solar energy for water heating, the solar-thermal charging of the integrated PCM can be realized using two well-established approaches: photo-thermal diffusion charging also known as thermal charging (TC) and optical charging (OC).37 In the former, the exposed absorber surface converts photon energy into thermal energy and then the converted thermal energy is transferred to the PCM unit via the thermal diffusion process. In the ideal case, and for the rapid thermal charging of PCMs, the thermal conductivity should be approximately 2 W m−1 K−1 or higher. However, the enhancement of thermal transport necessitates a high thermally conductive filler loading in the PCMs, which results in a significant reduction in energy storage capacity.
In contrast to TC, the OC approach relies on direct collection and conversion of solar energy into thermal energy via the addition of a lower content of photo-thermal dopants, which does not result in as much of an energy storage capacity sacrifice in the PCM. More importantly, this approach follows a step-by-step charging mechanism based on photon penetration instead of phonon dispersion, as for TC. In recent years, Tao's group has made significant advances in this regard. The authors enhanced the photon penetration depth via dynamic photo-absorber dopant tuning using magnetic manipulation (Fig. 4a) and explored the comparative solar-thermal energy storage performance of three different charging approaches, namely TC, OC, and magnetically-enhanced OC (MOC).37,38 In the TC approach, the temperature of the PCM composite is highest near the absorber surface; however, charged interface propagation (melted PCM region) is limited due to low thermal transport. In this scenario, the contribution of SHS is more pronounced than LHS (Fig. 4b). In contrast, the charged interface propagation of optically charged PCM is relatively high due to partial photon penetration of the interior. The OC approach improves the charging rate by more than 270% compared with TC and triples the overall amount of stored thermal energy. During OC, the contribution of latent heat is improved somewhat, but the presence of photo-absorber dopants in the melted region of the PCM composite absorbs the photon energy and increases the temperature of the liquid PCM, which leads to high liquid SHS. The removal of photo-absorber dopants from the melted region of the PCM composite avoids unwanted overheating of the melted PCM and leads to a fast-charging rate resulting in superior LHS performance of the integrated system.37

Further advancements were made by applying magnetically accelerated solar-thermal charging of PCM storage tanks for hot water supplies. In the presented design, a beam-down solar concentrator was used to focus solar radiation towards the molten salt-based PCM storage tank, which was charged using magnetically manipulated solar-thermal energy.38 The delivery of heat from the TES tank to the water heating system was achieved by coupling the storage tank with an oil and water-based heat exchanger (Fig. 4c). During storage tank discharging, a silicone oil-based heat transfer fluid with an inlet temperature of 17 °C was pumped into the spiral copper tubes to extract the stored heat energy for water heating. The outlet silicone oil was heated through the absorption of heat energy from the storage tank, then the temperature of the outlet silicone oil falls over time indicating the extraction of latent heat from the storage tank (Fig. 4d). Using the outlet temperature to calculate the solar to heat conversion efficiency reveals a value of 65.57% at a flow rate of 2.15 ml min−1, which increases to 72.63% at 7.58 ml min−1. In practical application, this magnetically accelerated solar-thermal charging approach can be coupled with commercial storage tanks that have a suitable pipeline structure to achieve superior solar to LHS for SWH systems. Moreover, recently explored organic salt-based PCMs can be considered a TES medium for similar systems.40 These salts are non-corrosive in nature and exhibit high phase change enthalpies and suitable transition temperatures. In addition, these PCMs are less viscous and will likely be advantageous as an increased charging rate via rapid magnetic manipulation can be achieved.
Another recent and important development is the design of full solar spectrum energy harvesting and storage system for 24/7 energy delivery.39 In this design, a hybrid concept comprising a localized PCM (L-PCM) and molecular storage material (MSM) was explored to provide day and night energy supply, respectively (Fig. 4e). Under direct solar illumination, the UV light is absorbed by the MSM and the remaining solar flux is absorbed by the L-PCM. The MSM stores solar energy through trans to cis isomerization while the L-PCM stores latent heat through a solid-to-liquid phase transition enabled by localized heating. In order to efficiently realize localized heating, a carbonized rayon-based photo-thermal dopant is incorporated into the PCM. Further, to minimize radiation heat loss, the upper surface of the L-PCM is covered with a silica aerogel, which is transparent to solar spectrum radiation and opaque to mid-infrared radiation. In this way, the incorporated silica aerogel layer allows the phase transition of L-PCM to be realized under a low solar flux and a constant temperature difference can be set between the MSM and L-PCM. For daytime operation, water is only circulated through the L-PCM component to gain heat. During the night, water (heat transfer fluid) is circulated from the L-PCM to the MSM to provide sufficient thermal energy for cis to trans reverse reactions to occur, which generally require temperatures above 70 °C. In this way, the solar-heated water is continuously supplied throughout the day and night via the extraction of sensible heat from the L-PCM, latent heat from the L-PCM and isomerization heat from the MSM.
4.2 Dispatchable power generation
Power generation based on solar-thermal storage technologies offers high energy conversion efficiencies as well as power dispatchability. This technology is capable of generating power via a wide range of conversion processes that first convert sunlight into heat and then heat to electric power using heat engines. Solar-thermal power generation systems can be categorized using heat engine type as follows: concentrated solar power (CSP) plants;41 solar thermoelectric generators;42 solar thermophotovoltaics;43 and hybrid systems.44 For all of these systems, the role of LHS is to allow dispatchable power generation. In the next sections, we explain the operation of these systems as well as the critical role of latent heat TES integration in dispatchable power generation.

Concentrated solar power plants. 
A CSP is a power generation plant that utilizes solar heat to produce electricity. Solar light is concentrated through mirror reflection and focused on a receiver where the solar energy is converted to heat (Fig. 5a). The harvested solar heat is transferred through a heat transfer fluid for steam generation, which drives the turbine to generate electricity. The heat transfer fluid directly generates steam in some CSP systems and is sometimes coupled with built-in TES units.45–47 Systems containing integrated TES provide a round-trip efficiency for the recovery of thermal energy to initially stored energy of approximately 95% and provide additional value to CSP plants in many respects. The first and most important benefit of TES is the increase of power generation capacity via continuous operation. A TES unit stores excess energy during hours of increased sunlight and extends the power generation period during periods of low sunlight e.g., in cloudy weather. The second benefit of TES integration is the reduction in power generation cost via demand–response management. As energy consumption in the industrial, commercial, and residential sectors varies greatly on a daily, weekly, and even a seasonal basis, built-in TES systems allow such demands to be efficiently correlated without the requirement of additional electricity storage systems. The third benefit of TES integration is overall system reliability improvement. Reducing the load by storing excess energy minimizes the possibility of damage during peak hours and ultimately increases the system lifetime.48,49 A CSP-integrated TES system mainly consists of two parts: thermal storage materials and heat transfer components. The thermal storage material stores thermal energy and the heat transfer component extracts or supplies heat from the thermal storage material. In order to enhance thermal storage capacity and increase storage time from day to night and one season to another, LHS systems are being developed for use in high-performance CSP plants. Depending on the design, the LHS materials (PCMs) are either incorporated into the heat transfer fluid to enhance heat capacity or utilized as storage materials (Table 1).

Considering the existing CSP temperature range (200–600 °C), the most suitable PCMs are inorganic-based PCMs that include metals, metal alloys, molten salts, and eutectic mixtures of molten salts. Salts including metal chlorides, nitrates, nitrites, carbonates, fluorides, and their eutectic mixtures are considered the most cost-effective candidates that simultaneously store latent heat during phase transition and sensible heat before or after phase transition. In this regard, the thermophysical properties of salt-based PCMs and their eutectic mixtures have been widely investigated. The detailed properties of these materials are presented in Table 1. Generally, the melting temperature and LHS capacity of salts constituting identical metals increase in the order nitrates < chlorides < carbonates < fluorides. The supercooling and corrosion of salt-based PCMs at high temperature are two fundamental drawbacks of these materials. Supercooling does not result in a large sacrifice in overall energy storage performance as it allows sensible heat utilization of supercooled liquid PCMs. Corrosion remains a substantial issue, which forces materials scientists to perform encapsulation of salt-based PCMs.71,72 A few reports exist in the literature that investigate the encapsulation of salt-based PCMs and the impact on corrosion mitigation.66,69 However, these reports present macro-scale encapsulation, which is not ideal in terms of the improvement of material properties. Thus, a universal, micro-encapsulation strategy that allows mass production of encapsulated molten salts is absent in the literature. Recently, progress has been made in the fabrication of high temperature (>1000 °C) containment and pumping materials based on ceramics and ceramic–metal composites.73,74 The developed materials, which are stable at high temperatures, allow the containment of salt-based PCMs, especially fluoride salts that generally exhibit high phase transition temperatures and LHS capacity. The storage of latent heat at high temperatures would definitely allow CSP plants to increase their solar-to-electric generation efficiency. At the same time, these newly developed containment materials allow the development of high-temperature, single metal-based LHS materials with significantly higher temperature operation ranges and LHS capacities. For instance, within a highly stable container, silicon can be considered as a thermal storage material capable of storing 1800 J g−1 of latent heat during phase transition at 1410 °C.
Other than the thermal storage material component in TES systems, the heat transfer fluid is also considered vitally important in the thermal performance of CSP plants. Thermal oils, liquid metals, and molten salts have been investigated as heat transfer fluids in CSP plants. The use of these molten salts as phase change heat transfer materials between the solar receiver and thermal storage tanks cannot be realized due to reversible circulation issues caused by PCM freezing in proximity to cold surfaces. Therefore, the only role of these materials is heat transfer in the molten state following the liquid sensible heat transfer mechanism. In this regard, materials with a lower freezing point are favored in order to avoid heat transfer fluid freezing within the operational temperature range. Generally, the heat capacity of these pure molten materials is lower than the desired range. In order to enhance the thermal conductivity and heat capacity of molten salt-based heat transfer fluids, additives are incorporated into the base fluid.62 One example of the enhancement of the heat capacity of a NaCl–CaCl2 eutectic salt is the dissolution of liquid magnesium metal in the eutectic salt.67 The findings revealed that facile dissolution of the liquid magnesium metal in the NaCl–CaCl2 eutectic salt can be performed with no agglomeration or additional chemical reactions occurring. By adding 1 wt% and 2 wt% of magnesium, the heat capacity of the fluid mixture was enhanced by 105.66% and 108.49%, respectively, compared with the base fluid. The heat transfer mechanism of the resulting fluid was also based on sensible heat transfer and was limited to a lower enhancement factor.
In addition to these benefits, the incorporation of microencapsulated PCMs into molten salts offers heat capacity enhancement via reversible phase transition at defined temperatures. During this process, the PCMs encapsulated within a stable shell remain solid, suspended particles in the molten fluid and did not significantly affect the liquid flow properties. The adopted PCMs are pure metal and their alloys and microencapsulation of these PCMs is realized in multiple ways. The simplest approach is to encapsulate a metallic PCM core within a thermally stable metal oxide shell using a surface oxidation process.55 Pure metallic PCMs including Sn, Bi, Al, and Al–Si alloy-based PCMs have been successfully encapsulated via the formation of corresponding metal oxide shells using the surface oxidation route.55,58 These Al and Al–Si-based alloys exhibit the desired performance including high LHS capacities (>250 J g−1) and suitable phase transition temperatures (500–600 °C); therefore, a significant focus has been placed on the encapsulation of Al, and Al–Si alloys within Al2O3 shells (Fig. 5b). The formation of the Al2O3 shell comprises a two-step process: boehmite coating and thermal oxidation. The thermal oxidation generally requires high temperatures (>1000 °C), which sometimes damages the shape of the microencapsulated PCM due to melting of the Al core. In order to promote the oxidation of Al at a lower temperature, oxidizing agents such as Ni are introduced to the metallic PCM particle surface (Fig. 5c). The presence of Ni facilitates catalytic oxidation by lowering the activation energy of Al. The second encapsulation route involves the formation of a silica shell through a sol–gel process, which is considered a cost-effective fabrication method. The silica shell exhibits high thermal stability and protects the PCM core from leakage and corrosion at high temperatures.63


Solar thermophotovoltaics. 
Another type of power generation system that generates electric power from solar heat via a photovoltaic converter is the solar thermophotovoltaic (STPV) system. Similar to CSP technology, TES integration enhances the dispatchable power generation features of STPV systems.75,76 The installation of TES components within STPV systems has been realized by following two different system designs. In the first design, the TES material is placed between a solar absorber and thermal emitter surface.77 During solar irradiation, the receiver absorbs solar energy and converts it into thermal energy, which is then transferred through the TES material to the emitter. When the solar flux is sufficient, the generated thermal energy simultaneously heats the emitter surface and charges the TES material. In this way, emission of the stored thermal energy is possible at night, allowing persistent operation of the STPV system.78 In order to allow switchable power generation, the photovoltaic module is adjustable within the stationary absorber/emitter subsystem that collects thermal radiation. In the second design, the solar-thermal energy is harvested and stored in a separate unit and, similar to CSP plants, the heat transfer fluid collects and supplies thermal radiation for power generation through photovoltaic converters.43 Following this design, Seyf et al. modeled a system-level design (Fig. 6a). In typical modeling, the authors applied a graphite-based absorber to convert concentrated sunlight into thermal power and liquid Sn as the heat transfer fluid to extract heat from the absorber to the TES material and then from the TES material to the photovoltaic subsystem.43

The arrows on the pipes indicate the flow path for charging and discharging the thermal storage.43 (b) Schematic illustration of solar electric energy conversion via LHS.80 (c) Heat flow performance of a prototype solar thermoelectric generator (STEG). During charging, ∼25–30% of the 900–1000 W of thermal power input from the main heater to the storage tank enters the PCM, while the rest is lost to the sides of the PCM, the sides of the valve thermosyphon, into the heat exchanger, and other miscellaneous losses. During the simultaneous charging and discharge phases, the thermal power delivered through the valve thermosyphon increases dramatically as the valve is opened, leading to an associated increase in electricity output from the STEG.42 Reproduced with the permission of Elsevier.

Considering the recombination limitations of photovoltaic subsystems, high-temperature thermal radiation is required to achieve a high cell energy conversion efficiency via the use of high bandgap materials. In this context, solar-thermal storage and supply at temperatures higher than 1000 °C are considered vital for efficient conversion.43 The PCM candidates for such high-temperature thermal storage and transfer are elemental B, Si, Ni, Ti, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Cu. Among all these, B exhibits the highest LHS capacity (4650 J g−1) however, the use of elemental B as a PCM is not favored due to its extremely high phase transition temperature (>2000 °C), which requires specialized containment materials. Other than B, Si is the most reliable option, which exhibits a high LHS capacity (1800 J g−1) and moderate phase transition temperature (1410 °C). Based on the required thermophysical properties and constrained processing, Si or B–Si alloys are potential PCM candidates for high-temperature LHS in STPV systems. As well as the solar-thermal storage performance, the thermal discharge performance of TES subsystems is determined by thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency, which can theoretically exceed 50% via the use of multi-junction photovoltaic cells. A high energy density solar-thermal storage within a constrained area and a moderately efficient thermal-to-electric conversion capability make STPV competitive in comparison to other power generation systems.77,79


Solar thermoelectric generators. 
Similar to STPV, a solar thermoelectric generator (STEG) is also based on a two-step power conversion process. In the first step, the concentrated solar power is converted into heat energy via efficient photo-absorber materials and in the second step, the harvested heat energy is used to exploit the large temperature difference across thermoelectric generator that converts heat energy into electric power.82 The STEGs are considered an intriguing alternative to other solar-electric power generation systems owing to their solid-state operation. The advancement in STEG has been inspired by the performance enhancement of thermoelectric materials, which leads to solar-electric conversion efficiencies up to 7.4%.83 Nevertheless, for any solar-electric conversion technology, to attract significant attention in the photovoltaic-dominated market competitive benefits are required. The energy conversion efficiency of flat-plate photovoltaic modules and concentrated photovoltaics is more than 20% and 35%, respectively. Based on theoretical predictions, the energy conversion efficiency of STEGs is limited to 15%.84 Considering this scenario, the potential for STEGs to compete with photovoltaic systems in terms of energy conversion efficiency is minimal. The only drawback of photovoltaic technology is the over-production of power during the daytime, which exceeds grid capacity and demands power storage devices such as electrochemical batteries. The grid-scale installation of these batteries increases the levelized cost of dispatchable electricity. In contrast, as stated earlier, STEGs are based on a two-step power conversion process; therefore, it is possible to couple solar-thermal conversion subsystems with a TES unit to allow dispatchable power generation.85 In order to generate dispatchable electricity through concentrated STEGs, Rea and coworkers developed a prototype system.42,80 In this system, sunlight is concentrated at the top of the tower where the power block is located and directly stores sunlight as latent heat; the stored latent heat is then used to generate dispatchable power through a thermoelectric generator or Stirling heat engine (Fig. 6b).80 The power block consists of a TES tank comprising 100 kg of eutectic Al–Si alloy as the PCM and a valve thermosiphon to control heat flow from the TES tank to the thermoelectric generator. The LHS and controlled transfer performance of the prototype system was analyzed over four simulated days (Fig. 6c). During this analysis, the system was subjected to four different operations: charging, discharging, simultaneous charging/discharging, and storage. The conclusion revealed that a large amount of thermal storage is efficiently realized in a small container and with an almost negligible temperature gradient (>5 °C). Furthermore, the valve thermosiphon effectively controlled heat flow by presenting a thermal flow on/off ratio of 430. Outstanding features such as high thermal storage capability and switching make STEGs promising candidates for dispatchable power generation applications.
In the aforementioned system, high-temperature solar-thermal energy storage enables high output power. Low-temperature TES-based STEGs have also been developed for smart applications.86,87 In these systems, solar energy harvesting and storage is realized within a single component (organic PCM-based composite), which makes the system design simple (Fig. 6d).81 Due to insufficient thermal performance of the explored PCM composites and efficiency limitations at low-temperature thermoelectric conversion, the output power of these systems is below 15 W m−2. Recently, it has been discovered that directional thermal conductance within anisotropic PCM composites under spot-like solar concentration enables high power density output (40.28 W m−2). More importantly, the thermal charging/discharging characteristic of integrated PCMs ensures durable STEG performance during cloudy weather or limited sunshine hours (Fig. 6e).81 This feature renders STEGs a promising alternative to photovoltaic devices for street lighting and many other smart applications, where low power is required at night. Further research on increasing the heat to power conversion efficiency through thermoelectric modules would offer progress in the commercialization of these systems.

5 Electro-thermal storage and utilization
The widespread adaptation of electrification requires the coupling of electrical energy with other forms of energy. The coupling of electric energy with thermal energy is a highly desired technology that offers substantial potential in a wide range of applications such as electric heating, electric cooling, and electric (power) storage applications. It is clear that the use of PCMs will improve the overall performance of these systems. In this regard, metallic-based PCMs such as Si and Al, which are electrically active, have been directly incorporated into electro-driven systems. The electro-thermal charging of metallic PCMs can be realized, for example, via Joule heating or induction heating. However, organic PCMs are electrical insulators and, therefore, their widespread utilization in electro-thermal systems is limited. In order to apply organic PCMs in electro-thermal storage systems, our group has demonstrated the doping of organic PCMs with electrically conductive fillers.88 The use of several carbon-based supporting materials such as graphene aerogel,89 graphene foam,90 graphite foam,91 expanded graphite,92 carbon nanotube sponge93 and arrays94 has been demonstrated as effective conductive skeletons for organic PCMs. The composites described in these studies exhibited electro-thermal storage efficiencies between 40 to 95%, which confirms the effectiveness of this technology. The incorporation of conductive materials not only improves the electro-driven capability but also enhances the thermal conductivity of composite PCMs, which is advantageous in reducing the discharge time of PCMs.88 From an application point of view, PCM-installed electro-thermal systems are electrically charged to store thermal energy during off-peak hours, which is then released in peak hours either in the form of heat or electric power. These applications range from domestic heating to grid-scale power storage and are based on demand management.95–99 In this section, we focus on grid-scale power storage technologies. The potential applications of electro-thermal storage for space heating are described in building energy conservation section.
The benefits of grid-scale electrical energy storage mainly include renewable penetration, power generation management, and improved grid reliability. In detail, the storage system decouples power generation from the supply chain, thus simple regulation of demand response is possible (Fig. 7a). Further, owing to distributed storage opportunities, relocation of the load to micro-grids or local grids improves grid security and as a result energy security. Grid-scale electricity storage technologies mainly include mechanical storage, electrochemical storage, and thermal storage. Each technology has its own benefits and drawbacks. Grid-scale TES using PCM latent heat is one of the least expensive and saleable storage technologies that also exhibit high storage density and cyclic stability. The comparatively high energy density of thermal storage material (PCMs) is attributed to the fact that virtually every atom contributes to thermal storage during phase transition, even at the bulk scale.85 In order to utilize TES technology for grid-scale electricity storage, power conversion is followed by a two-step process: electric-to-heat storage and heat-to-electric conversion. The former can be realized through either Joule heating or induction heating of thermal storage materials and is considered an energy-efficient process. In the latter case, the heat-to-electric conversion is achieved via heat engines, which is a thermodynamically inefficient process.100 In the majority of attempts to store power, Si is utilized as the thermal storage medium owing to its high LHS capacity (1800 J g−1) and suitable melting temperature (1410 °C). Voesch and coworkers achieved a power storage value of 2 GWh utilizing 7000 tons of Si by weight.85 The cost and thermal storage performance of Si equate to approximately $6 per kW h of stored energy, which clearly fulfills the storage demand ($80–100 per kW h capital cost) for the decarbonization of electricity generation.

(c) Schematic overview of the grid power storage system based on Si heat storage materials and multi-junction photovoltaic cells.101 
Several full system designs have been proposed for grid-scale adaptation. Datas et al. presented an electrical energy storage system design comprised of a switchable thermophotovoltaic coupled with an LHS unit (Fig. 7b).77 This system was charged using electrical energy and also solar irradiation, which was described in the previous section. During basic operation, electrical energy is converted into heat and stored as PCM latent heat. To extract the stored electricity, the thermophotovoltaic module moves inward towards the thermal storage unit and converts the emitter radiation to electricity. During thermal discharging, the PCM progressively freezes near the emitter surface and restricts the thermal radiation moving from the liquid PCM to the emitter surface. The high thermal conductivity of Si PCMs (25–130 W m−1 K−1) overcomes the blocking effect through solid-state thermal transport; however, for high volume storage, the efficiency and power capacity may reduce with time. Recently, it has been demonstrated that scraping the solidified layer of PCM within the heat exchanger structure significantly improves the discharging performance of LHS systems.102 Furthermore, the use of a heat transfer fluid would also be beneficial in this regard.
In order to address the issue of conductive heat transfer, Amy et al. explored liquid Si as a heat storage and convective heat transfer medium for grid-scale utilization.101 Here, the liquid Si behaves as an SHS material and operates at temperatures in the range 1900–2400 °C (Fig. 7c). To store electricity, the colder Si is heated from 1900 °C to 2400 °C using an electric heater and is then transferred to the hot storage tank through graphite and tungsten-based pipes. Due to the small surface area to volume ratio of the large storage tank, minimal (1%) heat energy is lost via thermal radiation over the course of a day, which is acceptable in the current scenario because ultra-efficient insulation for such high temperature operation is expensive. During stored power extraction, the hot Si is pumped through a multi-junction photovoltaic power cycle leading to the discharge of hot Si and the generation of electricity. As the hot Si passes through the pipes, the thermal radiation is extracted to generate power and the cooled Si is diverted to a cold storage tank for use in the following cycle. The thermal-to-electric generation efficiencies for these systems are thermodynamically limited to 15–40%, which is considered a serious disadvantage in this field. As grid TES technology is less expensive than many other energy storage technologies, the trade-off in terms of lower efficiency is considered worthwhile.101 Despite the competitive benefits, the widespread adaptation of grid TES technology has not gained commercial success, which necessitates further advancement regarding system design and material performance. The major challenges regarding the commercialization of this technology are high-temperature operation and limited material options for high-density storage.
6 Waste heat storage and utilization
Waste heat recovery using PCM latent heat is one of the simplest technologies that allows the efficient utilization of recovered heat in various industrial and residential sectors. The LHS capacity is utilized to fill the gap between heat supply and demand, which is advantageous in realizing the continual operation of heat recovery systems. In addition, the storage of waste heat as latent heat is favored owing to the heat-to-heat conversion process in which energy conversion losses are minimized. Waste heat recovery is accomplished by reuse within the same process from which it was harvested or by transportation to other sites. Thus, based on the location of heat sources and heat sinks, waste heat recovery systems are categorized into stationary waste heat recovery systems and portable waste heat recovery systems. For stationary waste heat storage, both the waste heat source and heat demand are located at the same site; however, for portable waste heat storage, the heat source and the end-user are separated by a physical distance. In the sections below, we highlight the key features of stationary and portable waste heat recovery systems; Table 2 summarizes these features.

6.1 Stationary heat recovery systems
Stationary heat recovery systems include cooling systems and internal combustion engines. In cold storage systems such as air conditioning and refrigeration, large quantities of exhaust and condensed heat is discharged directly into the surrounding atmosphere, which leads to increased energy consumption and environmental pollution. The effective utilization of waste heat from cold storage systems using PCM latent heat could be an essential approach allowing the simultaneous reduction of energy consumption and environmental pollution. In this regard, several studies focusing on the recovery of condensed heat in conventional air conditioning and refrigeration systems have been reported.103,104 The recovered heat has been utilized for space heating, domestic water heating, and industrial hot water supply. Although the energy recovery efficiency for these systems is under 20%, this method offers advantages in comparison to heat being wasted directly without useful application.105 In addition, the recovery of waste heat is also advantageous in improving the cooling performance of certain devices through superior heat transfer mechanisms.106 The exhaust of a cooling system usually operates at temperatures in the range of 30–50 °C, which means the most suitable PCM candidates are paraffin waxes, fatty acids, and fatty alcohols.
Combustion engines are important components of vehicle and conventional power generation systems. Heat recovery from combustion engines and electric vehicles is useful for numerous applications, with the most advantageous being cabin heating. Approximately 20% of fuel in combustion engines and 40% of battery capacity in electric vehicles is used for cabin heating and cooling. Meeting cabin heating demand through efficient utilization of engine waste and battery discharge heat reduces fuel consumption and extends driving range, respectively. In addition to cabin heating, the efficient utilization of stored waste heat is an effective method of warming the engine when restarting in cold climates. A 33.7% reduction in engine warm-up time was reported through efficient utilization of latent heat from the cooling system.107 Further, it has been speculated that LHS-based built-in heat recovery systems offer improved combustion engine thermal management performance in comparison to diesel-fueled heaters.108
6.2 Portable heat recovery systems
Portable heat storage refers to the recovery of waste heat from various industrial units and its transportation to another location, which is generally a distance from the heat source. Several approaches for the transportation of waste heat to other operational units or sites have been reported, these are usually based on distance between heat source and heat demand, the characteristics of heat demand and economical aspects. In this regard, adequate mobilized thermal energy storage (M-TES) technologies are gaining substantial attention owing to a lower initial investment cost and improved flexibility in comparison with competitors in the field.123,124 The M-TES technologies compactly store industrial waste heat in heat storage materials and the stored heat is then transported and distributed to end-users.123 The key advantage of this technology is the efficient use of waste heat without pipeline requirements, which are usually required in district heating network systems. In addition, M-TES technology is considered cost-effective in terms of setup efficiency and maintenance.125 Thus, the M-TES system is considered one of the most promising methods capable of achieving the standard of heat demand required for distribution to end-users.
A core process in M-TES systems is the reversible storage and release of latent heat. Based on the heat transfer mechanism, two different approaches including direct charging and indirect charging have been explored. During direct charging, the heat is directly transferred to the PCM through a heat exchanger, while during indirect charging, a heat transfer fluid is used. Wang et al.126 experimentally studied the thermal charging and discharging performance of an erythritol-incorporated M-TES system. In the experimental setup, approximately 74 kg and 60 kg of erythritol were used as the direct and indirect contact storage containers and stored 9.15 kW h and 6.8 kW h of heat power, respectively. The thermal charging performance of the direct contact M-TES system was limited due to heat blocking effects. An M-TES system comprising 17.6 tons of PCM was proposed by Nomura et al.,118 which was applied to the recovery of waste heat from a steel production unit and then transported to a chemical plant situated 10 km from the heat source. This M-TES system was able to supply 2.3 MW h of heat energy per cycle, at 250 °C.

Materials considerations for advanced M-TES systems. 
In portable heat storage applications, the stored heat is transported from one place to another; therefore, PCMs able to conserve stored heat energy for prolonged periods of time are considered suitable for M-TES systems. A simple route to temperature-sensitive energy conservation is realized by adopting PCMs that exhibit a high degree of supercooling; the PCMs store heat at a high melting temperature and release heat at a lower crystallization temperature. For instance, by utilizing the supercooling phenomenon in an erythritol PCM, heat storage at 118 °C release at 68 °C is achieved. Various PCMs for low-temperature applications have been developed for controlled heat release applications based on this supercooling phenomenon.127–129 The loss of a large quantity of sensible heat between the melting and crystallization temperature means supercooled PCMs are thermodynamically inefficient. In recent years, a few stimuli-controlled energy release PCMs have been developed being promising candidates for advanced M-TES systems. In these PCMs, heat energy is stored following the thermal charging from waste heat sources and then released at the demand site using external stimuli irrespective of temperature limitations. Both organic and inorganic PCMs have been explored for stimuli-controlled heat release applications.130–132 In order to conserve the stored enthalpy of organic PCMs, Grossman and coworkers introduced an activation energy barrier in charged PCMs by incorporating photo-switchable dopants.133 The azobenzene-based dopants, which exhibit trans–cis isomerization under ultraviolet irradiation, alter the PCM intermolecular dynamics, resulting in a lower freezing point and retention in the liquid state and of the latent heat capacity (Fig. 8). Under visible light irradiation, the photo-switchable dopants change conformation and trigger the release of stored latent heat as well as the additional isomerization heat. In the dark, approximately 200 J g−1 of latent heat is conserved for 10 h at a temperature 8 °C lower than the original crystallization temperature of PCMs.133 Lowering the photoactive PCM crystallization temperature to values below 0 °C has been realized via a similar intramolecular dynamic approach, which offers significant potential for the long-term storage and transfer of heat.134 The stimuli-controlled energy conservation in an inorganic Ti3O5-based PCM using various stimuli was explored by Tokoro and coworkers.135 The strip-based Ti3O5 stored heat energy (230 kJ L−1) through a solid–solid phase transition at 257 °C and released the heat energy following the application of a small amount of pressure at an ambient temperature. The reverse-phase transition was triggered using heat, light, and electric current. Briefly, this PCM reversibly stored and released heat by means of pressure and thermal action, pressure and light irradiation, and pressure and voltage application, which enables latent heat release control and offers numerous opportunities in M-TES systems.

7 Thermal regulation
7.1 Energy conservation in buildings
Energy consumption in buildings alone is responsible for one-third of the energy consumption in the world today, of which 60–70% results from heating and cooling systems.136 Unlike other energy-consuming sectors, 75% of building energy demand is met by fossil fuels, which contributes significantly to global warming.137 With a view to developing sustainable infrastructure, many countries have introduced mandatory regulations and development goals for energy saving in buildings. Green energy technologies are being employed to meet heating and cooling demands for buildings.138,139 TES in buildings can be realized by incorporating thermal storage materials in construction design such as walls and roof and storage devices such as storage heater for space heating. The utilization of PCM during construction design responds to external temperature swings and regulates the indoor temperature of buildings. The use of thermal storage heaters makes the building grid-interactive by utilizing low-level electricity for space heating. In detail, during periods of low electricity consumption, the low-cost electric energy is converted into heat energy and stored in the heat storage material, and when the electricity cost is higher during the daytime, the stored heat energy is released for space heating. Using this method, the storage heaters provide on-peak performance for an off-peak price.99 Commercial storage heaters are generally filled with sand or bricks for storage of thermal energy following SHS method. The incorporation of PCMs in off-peak storage heaters may offer a large amount of TES within a small volume and temperature swing, which are ultimately beneficial to reduce system size and energy-saving efficiency, respectively.100
The isothermal LHS capability of installed PCMs can be utilized to regulate the indoor temperature of buildings within the human comfort zone. For instance, to mitigate thermal discomfort, PCMs installed building stores and releases heat during the hot summer months and the cold winter months, respectively. A variety of PCMs with wide temperature ranges have been explored in this regard.140 For PCM application in building construction, the PCMs should exhibit phase transition temperatures that allow them to respond to external temperature fluctuations and a high latent heat capacity in order to maintain thermal comfort for longer periods of time. Considering the operation temperature range in buildings, low-molecular-weight organic PCMs and salt hydrates are the most suitable PCMs for thermal management in buildings. In order to prepare PCM-based building structures, direct mixing, porous adsorption or encapsulation methods have been adopted.140,141 The PCM can be applied in a number of building components, including the roof, walls, floor, and windows; the PCM properties required vary considerably from component to component.
A lightweight PCM with superior solar reflectance performance is considered ideal for cooling applications in roof structures. The solar reflectance and thermal buffering capabilities of PCM-installed rooftops reduce heat gain and ultimately reduces the indoor building temperature during summer seasons.142 In comparison with cooling paint technology, which has a negative impact during winter heating, rooftops installed with cooling PCMs offer superior thermal insulation throughout the whole year; this is advantageous in minimizing the cost of heating. In addition, rooftops installed with cooling PCMs are also advantageous in mitigating the formation of urban heat islands, which are mainly responsible for increasing environmental temperature in large cities.143–146 In terms of flooring and walls, PCM bricks or wallboards are respectively utilized. In addition to thermal storage performance, mechanical strength is also a key parameter for these applications. The majority of PCMs are fragile or exhibit low mechanical strength. The compositing of PCMs with rigid structural materials such as ceramics and wood means such issues are overcome. However, the development of mechanically strong, composite PCMs for applications in the building has received minimal attention.
In window applications, the PCM is sandwiched between two glass plates to thermally insulate thin window structures against diurnal temperature variations.16 During the day, the window-integrated PCM stores heat by melting and becoming optically transparent, thus fulfilling the fundamental requirements of a window. At night, the stored heat is released to perform thermal management. Another important property of PCMs is the reduction of their thermal conductivity in the liquid state, which can efficiently mitigate unwanted heat gain and loss through thin window structures.147 The energy efficiency of a building can also be improved by exploiting thermochromic PCMs in window structures for optical modulation. In cold weather, these materials transmit solar radiation through the window and inside the building, resulting in heating; conversely, in hot weather, the solar radiation is reflected and results in lower internal temperatures. In contrast, heat storage PCMs do not exhibit useful thermochromic properties therefore, they are not suitable for window applications due to lack of light transmission control. However, these materials are suitable for the thermal insulation of thin window structures.
7.2 Thermal management of the human body
Thermal management of the human body within a comfortable temperature range is essential. Most commonly, indoor cooling and heating systems are used to achieve thermal comfort for human beings. However, smart textiles that contain PCMs are an additional means by which efficient thermal management of the human body can be achieved without performing buildings thermal regulation. Traditional clothes perform thermal management of the human body by trapping the air around the body to obstruct convective heat transfer, which takes advantage of the low thermal conductivity of air.154 The performance of these clothes is not satisfactory under harsh weather conditions and the functionality is unidirectional. Winter clothes are not able to perform thermal management in the summer and vice versa. With this in mind, PCMs with the ability to reversibly store and release latent heat at a constant temperature offer essential potential in the development of thermo-regulated textiles for human body thermal management (Fig. 9a).148

The leakage of liquid PCMs during phase transition is the main hindrance in the application of PCM-integrated textiles. Electrospinning techniques have been extensively investigated in the fabrication of form-stable textile fibers, which are prepared by confining the PCM in the fiber structure core.150,151 The first demonstration of phase change nanofiber preparation was conducted by Xia's group in 2006.152 Following similar routes, Lu et al. fabricated a composite fiber consisting of commercial polyacrylonitrile (sheath) and paraffin (core), which were also doped with Cs0.32WO3 nanoparticles to enhance the solar-thermal energy harvesting performance.153 The nanoparticles, which exhibited excellent near-infrared absorption, increased the efficiency of daytime solar energy storage that was then released at night to maintain a stable temperature.
Generally, electrospinning requires high power consumption and complicated experimental procedures; therefore, mass production using this technique remains under development. A few other innovative methods have been adopted to fabricate PCM-containing textiles for thermal management of the human body. A simple impregnation method was explored by Zhang et al. to incorporate paraffin into a hollow polypropylene fiber; the as-prepared composite fibers were woven into cuboid blocks and then utilized for thermal therapy.154 The results demonstrated that a stagnation time of more than half an hour was achieved, presenting a superior thermal therapy effect. In another similar study, a paraffin–CNTs hybrid was impregnated into optimized hollow polypropylene fibers and then woven into a wearable membrane.155 The addition of CNTs increased the overall thermal conductivity of the hybrid structure, which resulted in improved thermal fluctuation sensitivity.
Instead of utilizing hollow fibers to encapsulate PCMs, Li et al. fabricated highly porous and conductive graphene aerogel-based fibers and prepared phase change composites for application in multi-responsive textiles.149 The phase change fiber was then coated with a hydrophobic resin to improve the washing performance. To test the electro and photo-driven thermal storage performance, the pure graphene aerogel fiber, and composited fiber were woven within the cotton fabric and subjected to simulated solar light. The solar heating performance indicated that the networked fabrics rapidly achieved high temperatures to warm the human body through sensible heating and LHS capabilities (Fig. 9b). In addition, the developed composite fibers stored heat by means of low voltage. Polyurethane-based flexible and conductive phase change composites for the thermal therapy of the human body by means of low voltage and sunlight irradiation have also been designed by our group.91,93 Very recently, our group has made further progress in the development of solar heat storage fabrics using a coating of phosphorene-encapsulated solid–solid PCMs and polymeric resins (Fig. 9c).29 In the developed structure, phosphorene converts sunlight into heat, which is stored within the PCM through solid-state operation. Depending on the PCM content, the developed fabric stored 51.13 J g−1 of latent heat and was readily charged under natural sunlight. The LHS capabilities of the incorporated PCM performed superior thermal therapy of the human body as well as numerous other applications. Ye and coworkers designed a flexible composite block by impregnating paraffin into the pores of a carbon-coated copper foam (Fig. 9d).20 The developed structure was flexible, which is advantageous for providing good contact between the skin and the cube-shaped PCM components (Fig. 9e). In order to perform thermal therapy, the composite was first charged to store latent heat using solar illumination and then utilized for thermal comfort management. The results revealed that the temperature surrounding the arm remained above 40 °C for more than ten minutes, which demonstrates a green method for the combination of solar heat and thermal therapy. Moreover, in the medical field, polymethyl methacrylate-based bone cement paste is widely used to treat fractured vertebra. In this process, the polymethyl methacrylate monomer is subjected to in situ polymerization inside the human body, which releases a large amount of polymerization heat and causes tissue necrosis. In order to tackle this problem, Lv et al. incorporated PCM microcapsules within a polymethyl methacrylate monomer, which stored the heat released during polymerization.156 The experimental results demonstrated that the PCM-incorporated cement offered sufficient tissue protection.
7.3 Thermal management of electronic devices
In order to increase the life span of electronic devices, the heat flux generated must be rapidly dissipated to the surrounding environment. Several thermal management technologies that provide cooling of electronic components have been explored. Passive cooling systems, such as installation of PCMs, exploit the essential thermal performance of the materials without requiring external power sources; more importantly, rapid-response and portable features can be incorporated.157 In particular, the isothermal heat absorption feature of PCMs offers tremendous potential in this field however, due to their intrinsic problems the widespread applications are limited. An alternative approach to develop PCMs for electronic thermal management is the fabrication of composite for direct applications. The fabrication of composites mitigates leakage, low thermal conductivity and structural rigidity issues of the PCM and improves system reliability.158,159 The preparation of PCM composites with three-dimensional porous materials results in superior performance. Several three-dimensional porous scaffolds including copper foam,160 aluminum foam,161 nickel foam,162 and carbon-based porous materials have been utilized to enhance PCM thermal performance.
In most of these studies, expanded graphite was composited with the PCMs to simultaneously enhance thermal conductivity and shape stability. Wu et al. prepared a PCM board via the simple blending of expanded graphite and melted paraffin wax following a hot-pressing procedure. A PCM board with high thermal conductivity (7.654 W m−1 K−1) and an excellent LHS capacity (141.74 J g−1) was fabricated and the heat dissipation performance was analyzed. The results revealed that the LHS capability of PCMs is responsible for lowering the heating surface temperature.163 In another similar report, a composite of paraffin and expanded graphite was utilized for the thermal management of lithium-ion batteries. When the weight of expanded graphite was increased to 30%, the thermal conductivity of the composite was significantly improved (13.85 W m−1 K−1) and leakage was efficiently decreased. In a more recent report, Wu et al. further increased the expanded graphite content up to 40% and performed mechanical pressing to obtain an aligned and packed composite structure (Fig. 10a).164 Rather than following a conventional melt infiltration process, the solid-state PCM was mixed with expanded graphite then hot pressed to coat a uniform PCM layer on the surface of the graphite flakes. Owing to the low phonon scattering and high phonon conductance between adjacent graphite flakes, the thermal conductivity of the aligned and packed PCM composite reached 35 W m−1 K−1. When the lithium-ion battery cell was coated with the developed material, the temperature of the wrapped monomer was maintained below 55 °C at a charging/discharging rate of 3 C (Fig. 10b), which efficiently protected battery performance. In general, a tradeoff usually exists between thermal conductivity and thermal storage capacity. Higher loadings of conductive filler lead to high thermal conductivity and poor thermal storage capacity and vice versa. Experimental optimization of filler content demonstrated that composites with 16–20 wt% expanded graphite exhibit optimal thermal management of lithium-ion batteries.165

In (2) and (3), the film was attached to the phone for approximately 1 s and 1 min, respectively; in (4) and (5), the film was retained on the phone for approximately 1 s.167 Reproduced with the permission of the American Chemical Society. 
In comparison to conventional electronic devices, the requirement for further developments in advanced wearable and portable electronic device thermal management is more urgent and requires considerable attention. For advanced electronic devices, both the cooling of device components and the manipulation of generated heat need to be simultaneously addressed. For instance, the transfer of heat from device components to the surrounding environment prevents device failure, but may also cause thermal discomfort to device users. However, the adoption of a thermally insulating interface for the protection of human skin may result in the accumulation of heat and ultimately device failure. The isothermal heat storage characteristics of PCMs perform both functions and are considered an ideal solution for wearable device thermal management (Fig. 10c). In order to avoid electrical leakage from the thermally managed structures, thermally conductive and electrically-insulating phase change composites have been developed via the addition of boron nitride (BN) to PCMs.166 Very recently, progress has been made in the development of BN aerogels and composites incorporating PCM for the thermal management of 5G cellular phones.167 It has been demonstrated experimentally that the developed PCM composite structures significantly lowered the surface temperature of cellular phones during sustained gaming use under 5G operation (Fig. 10d).
In conclusion, high thermal conductivities and flexibility are two key properties of PCM-based thermal management structures that determine the overall figure of merit. Considerable attention has been devoted to increasing the thermal conductivity of PCMs via composition with conductive fillers. In contrast, there are relatively few reports on the development of flexible PCMs; the majority of reports on flexible PCMs feature flexible scaffold-based designs. The flexibility of the host scaffold significantly reduces when composited with rigid PCMs, thus hindering the utilization of these materials in real-life applications. In order to address the flexibility issues, a number of recently developed, intrinsically flexible PCMs and their composites could be considered for real-world applications.168,169
8 Summary and outlook
The global demand for sustainable energy storage technologies has increased exponentially in recent years. Among the various methods of energy storage, TES technologies have received tremendous attention owing to their diverse and sustainable application prospects. Latent heat-based TES represents the most actively pursued technology; its advantages include high thermal storage densities, operational simplicity, and low-cost storage materials. Owing to these features, latent heat TES technology has been extensively investigated in a diverse range of sustainable energy applications including solar energy, electrical energy, and waste energy utilization systems. The role of LHS in renewable energy systems is the storage of excess energy during daytime or off-peak hours and the provision of a dispatchable supply during peak hours whilst maintaining continuous system operation. Compared with other technologies, latent heat-based power storage technologies are less expensive and longer-lasting; therefore, there is significant potential of these technologies for widespread deployment. In addition to being cost-effective, the heat-to-heat charging feature of LHS renders this technology optimal for waste heat recovery in terms of energy harvesting efficiency and operational simplicity. Moreover, LHS enables waste heat usage in portable applications, meaning it becomes more attractive from an application point of view. Moreover, isothermal heat storage offers widespread potential in the thermal regulation of buildings, which represents a significant proportion of energy consumption around the world. Thermal regulation applications also extend to wearable devices or smart textiles, which offers further diversification prospects for this technology.
Despite the development of LHS technologies, there are still several key issues regarding material fabrication and system design that require considerable attention in the future. (1) The efficiency of most of power generation systems increases at higher operating temperatures but the choice of high figure of merit PCMs for extremely high temperatures (>800 °C) applications is limited; therefore, development of PCMs compatible with such high temperatures would be highly desirable for renewable energy storage systems. (2) Utilization of latent heat for heat transfer-related applications, the addition of core–shell encapsulated PCMs into the base fluid to enhance heat capacity has been reported. The incorporation of macro or microcapsules results in liquid flow and sedimentation problems in composite fluid systems; therefore, nanocapsules are favored. The development of nanocapsules for high-temperature operation is rarely reported; therefore, the fabrication of PCM nanocapsules using carefully selected and compatible core–shell materials may provide valuable progression in the design of advanced CSPs as well as numerous other applications. (3) Despite the recent progress, thermophysical and thermochemical properties of existing PCMs are not up to the required level. Further improvement in thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, phase change enthalpy, phase separation, and degree of supercooling of PCMs by compositing with suitable supporting materials would be vital to enhance overall TES system performance. (4) Compared with electrochemical power storage systems, thermal storage systems lack discharging controllability. To the best of our knowledge, an LHS system with more than 90% discharging control is not currently available. Considering this scenario, temperature-independent LHS systems are highly desirable in a broad range of applications. (5) During system design, heat losses should be minimized for the efficient round-trip storage of heat energy. However, control over radiative heat losses is rarely studied in high-temperature storage systems. (6) Power storage technologies based on LHS remain limited by low heat to power conversion efficiencies, which necessitates fundamental research to either improve the energy conversion efficiency of existing technologies or to discover alternative methods for an efficient heat to power conversion process. (7) Significant quantity of heat is generated in many energy conversion processes and is being wasted without useful application. For instance, water condensation heat in solar evaporation systems is wasted without recovery in most of the present systems. The designing of a hybrid system that can simultaneously produce clean water and hot water through enthalpy recovering could be energy efficient and more useful for household applications. (7) LHS systems lack international technical standards regarding PCM performance testing and system efficiency measurements. For instance, significant variation in PCM thermal properties exists in literature reports which is mainly due to different adopted procedures and lack of calibrations. Therefore, to continue progress in this field, standardized measurement methods and a centralized database need to be urgently established.

Broader context
Thermal energy is one of the most abundant forms of energy. Approximately 90% of the world's energy consumption involves the generation or manipulation of thermal energy over a wide temperature range. A significant portion of this massive amount of thermal energy is being wasted without useful applications. The storage of excessive thermal energy ensures the persistent operation of the integrated system and offers promising potential in many domestic and industrial applications, and power generations. Among the numerous methods of thermal energy storage (TES), latent heat TES is one of the best suited technologies in terms of storage density, economic viability, and industrial maturity. Owing to these outstanding characteristics, latent heat TES materials and systems are extensively investigated to achieve sustainable energy goals. Herein, we review the potential benefits of latent heat TES for solar energy utilization, power storage, waste heat recovery, and thermal regulatory systems. We start by presenting fundamental technology underpinning these systems and then discuss the broad and critical role of TES followed by literature highlights. We hope our efforts will inspire and facilitate the TES community to design future energy systems to meet sustainable development goals.

 	Fig. 6  Dispatchable solar to electric power generation systems. (a) Schematic illustration of a utility-scale solar thermophotovoltaic (STPV) system coupled with an LHS unit. The arrows on the pipes indicate the flow path for charging and discharging the thermal storage.43 (b) Schematic illustration of solar electric energy conversion via LHS.80 (c) Heat flow performance of a prototype solar thermoelectric generator (STEG). During charging, ∼25–30% of the 900–1000 W of thermal power input from the main heater to the storage tank enters the PCM, while the rest is lost to the sides of the PCM, the sides of the valve thermosyphon, into the heat exchanger, and other miscellaneous losses. During the simultaneous charging and discharge phases, the thermal power delivered through the valve thermosyphon increases dramatically as the valve is opened, leading to an associated increase in electricity output from the STEG.42 Reproduced with the permission of Elsevier. (d) Schematic of device design for solar–thermal–electric conversion. (e) Output voltage and current of STEG with a duration of time (11:08–14:00, February 24, Mianyang, China, peak solar irradiation = 0.78 kW m−2).81 Reproduced with permission of American Chemical Society.
