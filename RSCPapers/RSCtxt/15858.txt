Here we report for the first time a high-performance electrocatalyst of ultrathin Ni–Ni3Se2 nanosheets on graphene nanosheets. Specifically, the thickness of the obtained nanosheets is in the range of 1.5–2.5 nm. Furthermore, the specific surface area of the ultrathin Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene nanosheets was as much as ∼162.5 m2 g−1. The electrocatalytic activity of Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene nanosheets was measured as a counter cell of dye-sensitized solar cells. Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene nanosheets exhibited high performance for the reduction of I3− to I−, and achieved higher power conversion efficiency (7.76%) compared with that of the Pt-based reference electrode (7.42%).
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have demonstrated attractive merits over other photovoltaic devices, because of their high efficiency, low cost, simple fabrication procedures and environmental friendliness.1–4 A typical DSSC device consists of three parts: a dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode with percolating channels for electron migration, an electrolyte system containing an I3−/I− redox couple and a counter electrode (CE) for triiodide reduction.5–8 In order to reach high device performance, CE materials should possess a low sheet resistance and high catalytic activity toward the CE reduction reaction.9–11 Recently, great efforts have been devoted to develop alternative CE materials, such as metals, metal oxides and chalcogenides, and control their chemical composition, crystal structure or morphology to achieve the demand of high catalytic activity and electrical conductivity for DSSCs.12–15 To date, metal chalcogenides with unique nanostructures have been proven quite effective in the reduction of triiodide, such as CoNi2S4 nanoribbons, MoSe2/Mo bilayer structure and SnS2 nanoparticles.16–19
Ultrathin nanostructure of metal chalcogenides has attracted intensive attention due to the high surface area and short transport path for chemical/physical processes.20 In addition, high percentage of surface atoms and much exposed interior atoms induce the formation of defects serving as highly efficient active sites for electrocatalytic reaction.21 Even more important, the proper construction of ultrathin nanostructure on the surface of mechanically robust graphene nanosheets could offer sufficient contact interface between active materials and electrolytes, and thus lead to a high electrochemically active surface area for faradic reactions at the defects and grain boundaries of the crystalline lattices.22,23 Furthermore, the formation of strong chemical contacts between the ultrathin nanostructures and graphene facilitates interfacial charge transfer and reduces the loss of active materials.23 In this view, the combination of ultrathin nanosheets and graphene would be advantageous to serve as efficient CE materials.
As an important kind of metal chalcogenides, nickel selenides are highly attractive to serve as CE materials for DSSC because of their unique electronic configuration and fast electron-transfer channels.24–26 Our group found that the Ni0.85Se mesoporous spheres owned better electrocatalytic activity than conventional Pt with respect to I3−/I− redox reactions.27 However, due to the valence electronic configuration of Ni (3d84s2) and the small difference in electronegativity between Ni (χ = 1.9) and Se (χ = 2.4), up to now, research studies on the nanostructure of nickel selenides are mainly about traditional fabrication.25,26 Nevertheless, the effect of the ultrathin nanostructure of nickel selenides on the electrocatalytic activity has not been reported so far.
Herein, we report a facile approach to prepare ultrathin Ni–Ni3Se2 nanosheets on graphene nanosheets. As-obtained Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene nanosheets with an ultrathin thickness in the range of 1.5–2.5 nm were introduced to DSSCs, which has never been reported. Apart from the above mentioned advantageous combination of ultrathin nanostructure and graphene nanosheets, the metal–semiconductor heterojunctions of Ni–Ni3Se2 within the same structure not only provide a more efficient charge separation of the hybrid, but also form abundant defects by the high interconnectivity between semiconductor and metal.28–30 The fabricated device with ultrathin Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene nanosheets exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3− to I−, and achieved a higher power conversion efficiency of 7.76% comparable with that of the Pt-based reference device (7.42%).
Experimental section
Synthesis of ultrathin Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene nanosheets
For the preparation of ultrathin Ni–Ni3Se2 nanosheets on graphene nanosheets, graphite oxide (GO) was firstly prepared by a modified Hummer's method.31 Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene were prepared by a typical solvothermal method with NiSO4·6H2O and Na2SeO3·5H2O as nickel source and selenium source. In a typical synthesis, 3 mmol NiSO4·6H2O was dissolved in a mixture solution of 15 mL distilled water and 15 mL ethyl alcohol, then, 5 mL GO aqueous solution (10 mg mL−1) was added under stirring. 1 g NaOH and 1 g ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) were added into the above solution. The mixed solution was agitated for 1 hour to enable good GO dispersion in the suspension. After this, 1 mmol Na2SeO3·5H2O was placed into the mixture. Subsequently, for reducing Na2SeO3 and GO, 5 mL N2H4·H2O was added dropwise. The resulting solution was put into Teflon-lined autoclave of 50 mL capacity and heated at 180 °C for 15 h. Then, the autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The product was washed with water and absolute ethanol to remove impurities, and then dried at 60 °C. During this synthesis process, excessive Ni source with the reduction of hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O) was added to construct metal–semiconductor heterojunctions. Unfortunately, the ultrathin nanostructure of Ni–Ni3Se2 cannot be obtained with smaller amount of NiSO4·6H2O or without the addition of graphene.
Characterization of obtained samples
The crystallinity and composition of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max-2500, JAPAN SCIENCE) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The purity of the samples was performed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (PHI 5000 VersaProbe). The morphology of samples was studied by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, NanoSEM 430, FEI). More detailed insight into the microstructure of the sample was given by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20, operating at 200 kV, FEI). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area was analyzed by the BET equation using a Tristar 3000 nitrogen adsorption apparatus.
Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
The Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene CEs were prepared by a slurry coating procedure on a cleaned FTO substrate. The slurry, consisting of 80 wt% Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene products, 10 wt% acetylene black and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride ground together, was then dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. Then the slurry was further sonicated for 30 min, and kept stirring overnight. Subsequently, the as-prepared slurry was coated onto the FTO substrates using a doctor blade method. The electrodes were dried at room temperature for 24 h in a vacuum oven. For comparison, graphene CE was prepared by the same method. The standard Pt CE was purchased from Dalian Heptachroma Solar Tech Co., Ltd.
A commercial TiO2 sol (Solaronix, Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) was used to prepare the TiO2 film on FTO also by the above-mentioned method, and the film was soaked in an N719 dye solution (in ethanol) for 24 h to obtain dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes. DSSCs were assembled by injecting the electrolyte into the aperture between the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and CE. The liquid electrolyte is composed of 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine with acetonitrile as the solvent. Surlyn 1702 was used as the spacer between the two electrodes. The two electrodes were clipped together with solid paraffin working as the sealant to prevent the electrolyte solution from leaking. The effective cell area was 0.25 cm2. For comparison, other DSSCs were fabricated by replacing Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene with graphene and Pt with other procedures remaining the same.
Characterization of the CEs and DSSCs
All the electrochemical properties were measured with the Zahner IM6 exelectrochemical workstation. Photocurrent–voltage curves were conducted in simulated AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2, Trusttech CHF-XM-500W) with a Keithley digital source meter (Keithley 2410, USA). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was recorded with a three electrode system. Pt was used as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. A solution of 10.0 mM LiI, 1.0 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile served as the electrolyte. CV curves were recorded in the range of −0.4 to 1.2 V at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) analysis was conducted at zero bias potential and the impedance data covered a frequency range of 0.1 Hz–1 MHz. The amplitude of the sinusoidal AC voltage signal was 5 mV. The analyses of the resulting impedance spectra were conducted using the software Zview 2.0. Tafel-polarization measurements were employed in a symmetrical dummy cell which was used in the EIS experiments. The electrolyte was the same as the electrolyte of DSSC. The scan rate was 20 mV s−1, and the voltage range is −1.0 to 1.0 V.
Results and discussion
Chemical composition and morphological properties of ultrathin Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene nanosheets
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to detect the phase of Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene product. XRD patterns (Fig. 1A) show that the obtained Ni–Ni3Se2 is in good agreement with the component of Ni3Se2 (JCPDF NO. 19-0841) and Ni (JCPDF NO. 04-0850). It is known that RGO shows a broad (002) peak at about 23.0°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to further evaluate the chemical valence of the as-prepared Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene sample. The Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 1C) from the surface of Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene was fitted using three components: a narrow peak at 852.56 eV corresponding to metallic Ni, and two peaks at 856.0 eV and 873.0 eV corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 states, respectively.32 The peak at 54.83 eV (Fig. 1D) is representative of the Se 3d binding energy. The binding energy values of Ni and Se are in good agreement with the reported values in the literature for the Ni3Se2 and Ni phases.32,33

The morphologies of the resulting Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene product were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM image at low magnification (Fig. 2A) reveals that ultrathin Ni–Ni3Se2 nanosheets with a curled shape interconnect together and distribute on the surfaces of graphene nanosheets. The detailed structure was then characterized by TEM, and the TEM image (Fig. 2B) of the product furthermore reveals a interconnect nanosheets structure, which is beneficial to increase charge transfer channels and decrease the electrons hop among 2D nanosheets structure. The magnified TEM (Fig. 2C and D) further imply that the as-obtained Ni–Ni3Se2 nanosheets are very thin, and the thickness of nanosheets is estimated in the range of 1.5–2.5 nm from the rolled edges (Fig. S2†). Furthermore, HRTEM image in Fig. 2D revealed that the (003) and (202) crystal plane of Ni3Se2 and the (111) crystal plane of Ni can be found in the same nanosheet.

The specific surface area and porous feature of the sample was verified by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements. Fig. 3 displays the nitrogen absorption–desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution (inset in Fig. 3). The isotherm was observed with type IV sorption behavior, which is the characteristic of mesoporous materials. The BET specific surface area of the sample was calculated to be as much as ∼162.5 m2 g−1. The pore size distribution data indicate that a majority of the pores are around 13 nm, determined by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. Such high BET surface area and mesoporous structure provide many active sites and adsorption sites, and further allow the inner active sites of the catalyst to come into full contact with the electrolyte, which are highly desirable for electrochemical reaction.

Electrocatalytic performances of DSSC devices based on ultrathin Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene nanosheets
The electrocatalytic performance of the Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene was evaluated for the most commonly employed I−/I3− electrolyte system in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). For comparison, electrocatalytic performance of the Pt electrode and graphene electrode were also measured under the same conditions. To characterize the electrocatalytic performance of various catalysts, cyclic voltammogram (CV) (Fig. 4) was carried out in an acetonitrile solution containing LiI (10 mM), I2 (1 mM), and LiClO4 (0.1 M) at a scanning rate of 25 mV s−1. The left pair in Fig. 4 could be assigned to the redox reaction of I3−/I− and the right one assigned to the reaction of I2/I3−. The cathodic peak current density (JOx-A) and peak-to-peak separation (Epp) between the anodic and cathodic peaks are two important parameters for assessing the catalytic activity of catalysts.34,35 The smaller Epp value of Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene (267 mV) than that of Pt CE (348 mV) indicates the lower overpotential loss of Ni–Ni3Se2. Furthermore, Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene presented higher JOx-A (1.98 mA cm−2) than Pt CE (1.79 mA cm−2). Lower Epp value and higher peak current densities demonstrate that the Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene CE presents the superior electrocatalytic activity in the reduction of I3−.36 To evaluate electrochemical stability of the Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene CE, as shown in Fig. 5, consecutive CV experiments were performed at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. After 50 cycles of scanning, there was negligible change in JOx-A and Epp, revealing the excellent chemical stability of Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene CE.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) represents the intrinsic interfacial charge-transfer and charge-transport kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface.37 Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist plots of the corresponding symmetrical cells, and the parameters calculated from the fitting results of the equivalent circuit are summarized in Table 1. The ohmic series resistance (Rs), obtained from the high-frequency intercept on the real axis, is directly related to the sheet resistance of CE and electrolyte. The smaller Rs value of Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene (12.70 Ω) than Pt (12.99 Ω) and graphene (13.03 Ω) reveals its better electrical conductivity. The charge transfer resistance (Rct), obtained from the semicircle in the high frequency region, is a measure of electron exchange between CE and electrolyte, and changes inversely with the catalytic activity of different CEs on the reduction of triiodide.38 Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene gave rise to a Rct value of 0.61 Ω, which was smaller than Pt (1.43 Ω) and graphene (4.8 Ω) CEs. These results also reveal the superior electrocatalytic performance of the Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene in the reduction reaction of I3− to I−.

To further analyze the interfacial charge transfer process between electrolytes and CEs, Tafel polarization was carried out using the symmetrical cells. Fig. 7 shows the typical Tafel curves of the cells based on Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene, Pt and graphene CEs. The intersection of the cathodic branch with the Y-axis can be considered as the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim), which depends on the diffusion coefficient of I3−/I− redox couples at the CE/electrolyte interface.39,40 As shown in Fig. 7, the higher Jlim value of Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene than that of Pt and graphene suggests its good diffusion properties in the DSSC device. On the other hand, the exchange current density (J0) can be obtained from the slope for the anodic or cathodic branches.41 The higher J0 value of Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene in Fig. 7 that Pt and graphene indicates the better electrochemical performance of Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene CE in the catalytic reduction of I3−.42 Both of J0 and Jlim match well with the results of CV and EIS experiments, and demonstrate the superior catalytic activity toward triiodide reduction of the Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene.

The Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene, Pt and graphene electrodes were further assembled with N719-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes to form DSSC devices. The energy band analysis diagram of different components in DSSCs is illustrated in Fig. 8A. In the diagram, the CBM is conduction-band minimum, D* is excited dye molecule, D is dye molecule, ECB is conduction band energy, Ef is Fermi energy, EVB is valence band energy.27 In detail, the ECB and Eg of TiO2 are about −4.21 and 3.20 eV, respectively. The oxidation reduction potential of I3−/I− is about 0.4 V (versus standard hydrogen electrode). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of N719 dye are about −3.5 and −5.0 eV, respectively.43 Fig. 8B shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs, and the corresponding solar cell parameters are summarized in Table 1. The Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene CE exhibited higher short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc = 16.29 mA cm−2) and fill factor (FF = 0.64) than that of the Pt CE (Jsc = 15.58 mA cm−2, FF = 0.63). The enhanced JSC value originated from high catalytic activity for I3− reduction, which was demonstrated by high JOx-A and low Epp in CV curves. The improvement of FF could be attributed to the lower Rs and Rct from the EIS tests.38 Eventually, the higher JSC and FF resulted in higher PCE value of the DSSC based on Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene (7.76%) than that of Pt (7.42%). In contrast, the device using graphene as CE showed a Jsc value of 12.81 mA cm−2, a FF value of 0.41, leading to a PCE value of 4.05%. As mentioned above, the high performance of the device applying Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene could be ascribed to several factors: (a) the ultrathin nanostructures supplied high percentage of surface atoms and many exposed interior atoms, and further induced the formation of defects serving as highly efficient active sites for enhancing electrocatalytic activity;21 (b) the formation of strong chemical contacts between the ultrathin nanosheets and graphene facilitated interfacial charge transfer and reduced the loss of active materials;23 (c) the metal–semiconductor heterojunctions of Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene formed abundant defects by the high interconnectivity and conductivity between semiconductor and metal.29

Conclusions
In summary, a facile solvothermal method has been developed for the successful synthesis of ultrathin Ni–Ni3Se2 nanosheets on graphene nanosheet. Due to the advantageous combination of ultrathin nanosheets (1.5–2.5 nm) and graphene, Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene exhibited high catalytic activity and good electrical conductivity. Notably, Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene displays a higher PCE of 7.76% than that assembled with Pt (7.42%). These results indicate that the ultrathin nanostructure of Ni–Ni3Se2/graphene is highly promising in developing DSSC device with high performance. Importantly, this work also provides new insight to design efficient CE materials and fabricate high performance DSSCs.
