    , Accepted 26th February 2018First published on 26th February 2018AbstractCesium metal halides are potential light-harvesting materials for use in the top cells of multi-junction devices due to their suitable bandgaps and good thermal stabilities. In particular, CsPbI3 has a bandgap of 1.7 eV, which is suitable for perovskite/Si tandem cells. However, the desirable black phase for CsPbI3 is not stable because Cs is too small to support the PbI6 octahedra. Also, there is room for improvement in terms of cell performance. Herein, we partially replace Pb2+ with Ca2+ in the CsPbI3 precursor, producing multiple benefits. Firstly, more uniform films with larger grains are produced from CsPbI3 with Ca2+, due to the reduction in the size of the colloids in the precursor solution with Ca2+. This morphology improvement provides better contact at the interface between the perovskite and the hole transport layer. In addition, it is found that the surface of the film is modified by the formation of a Ca rich oxide layer, providing a surface passivation effect. Finally, incorporation of Ca increases the band gap, leading to an increase in output voltage. The best CsPbI3 solar cell using 5% Ca2+ substitution in the precursor achieves a stabilised efficiency of 13.3%, and maintains 85% of its initial efficiency for over 2 months with encapsulation.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells have gained research interest due to the rapid rise in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% in 2009 to 22.1% in 2016.1 Many of the improvements have been achieved with methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) or a mixture of both with small amounts of Br and cesium (Cs) or rubidium (Rb) cations,2,3 although challenges associated with long term thermal stability remain.4–6
Inorganic Cs perovskites have been considered as a potential alternative due to their higher thermal stability.7 However, utilising Cs perovskites in photovoltaic devices is challenging. CsPbBr3 has a bandgap of 2.3 eV which is higher than ideal bandgaps even in multi-junction tandem solar cells.9 Incorporating I into CsPbBr3 reduces the bandgap to 2.05 eV for CsPbIBr28,10,11 and 1.9 eV for CsPbI2Br.7,12–16 Compared to those perovskites, CsPbI3 has a more suitable bandgap of 1.73 eV for photovoltaic applications,17 especially for double junction perovskite/Si tandem cells.18,19 However, CsPbI3 does not have a stable perovskite phase at ambient temperature due to the relatively small ionic radius of Cs, which cannot hold the PbI6 octahedra together, resulting in a low tolerance factor close to 0.8.20 Eperon et al. reported that CsPbI3 could be stabilised by adding HI acid into the perovskite precursor solution, producing cells with 2.9% power conversion efficiency (PCE). Luo et al. then further developed a sequential solvent engineering method with an IPA treatment to stabilise the CsPbI3, fabricating cells with a PCE of 4.13%.21,22 To overcome the phase instability, the metal in the B site in an ABX3 perovskite can be partly substituted with a metal with a smaller ionic radius to stabilise the perovskite phase. Recently, Hu et al. partly replaced Pb (1.19 Å) with bismuth (Bi, 1.03 Å) in CsPbI3. The bandgap of the Bi incorporated CsPbI3 was reduced from 1.7 eV to 1.56 eV. The best cell achieved a PCE of 13.2% and maintained 68% of the initial efficiency after 168 h under ambient conditions without encapsulation.23
In this work, we utilize calcium (Ca, 1.00 Å) to partially substitute Pb in the CsPbI3 precursor to produce CsPbI3 films. We observe a reduction in the size of the colloids in the precursor solution as a result. This leads to a more uniform film formation with a larger grain size, which results in better contact between the perovskite and hole transporting material (HTM) and an increase in device performance. In addition, the bandgap of the film increases with increased Ca2+ substitution and the surface of the resultant film has been modified to become a calcium-rich oxide layer, which provides a passivation effect when the amount of Ca2+ is appropriate. Subsequently, we fabricated a mesoporous device with a thick perovskite layer (around 400 nm) at the optimal Ca concentration (5 mol% Ca2+ in the precursor), producing photovoltaic cells with respectable performance. After applying an anti-reflection coating, the champion cell achieves a PCE of 13.5% under a reverse scan and a stabilised PCE of 13.3%. With encapsulation, the device maintains 85% of the initial PCE after 2 months of storage under ambient conditions.
Results and discussion
To investigate the effect of partial substitution of Pb2+ with Ca2+ on the CsPbI3 precursor solution and on the crystallinity and morphology of the films subsequently formed, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CsPb1−xCaxI3 test structures, where x is the molar ratio of Ca in the precursor. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the CsPb1−xCaxI3 films. They all show a typical cubic perovskite phase with the main XRD peaks at 14.5°, 20.8°, and 29.1°, corresponding to the (100), (110) and (200) planes, respectively, in good agreement with those previously reported.24 However, the reference CsPbI3 film (0% Ca) has a small peak at 12.6° corresponding to PbI2 which is typical when there is an incomplete conversion of the precursor into the perovskite phase. As the molar ratio of Ca2+ increases, the PbI2 peak disappears and the crystallinity of the perovskite phase improves. According to a previous density functional theory study, XRD peaks are expected to have a lower 2 theta angle when Pb is partially substituted with an alkaline-earth metal such as Mg, Sr, Ba and Ca.25 However, in our measurements, there are negligible angle shifts, or the shifts are too small, namely, below the measurement resolution.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) surface images of CsPb1−xCaxI3 perovskite films (where x is the molar ratio of Ca in the precursor) are shown in Fig. 2a–f. The reference CsPbI3 (0% Ca) film is composed of densely packed small grains, with an average domain size of 1 μm. With 2% Ca2+ in the precursor, the perovskite film shows less coverage. However, at 5% Ca2+, the small grains combine into larger grains with a size of up to several μm, resulting in better coverage. Cross-sectional SEM images of the solar devices made from CsPbI3, CsPb0.98Ca0.02I3, and CsPb0.95Ca0.05I3 were also taken. Results are shown in Fig. 2d–f, revealing a dramatic reduction in the roughness as the molar ratio of Ca2+ increases to 5%. To quantify the surface roughness of the films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed on implied perovskite films, which were silicone gel replicates of the CsPb1−xCaxI3 perovskite films as the replicates do not degrade as the original perovskite films would during AFM measurement. Details of the replication process can be found in the experimental section. Top view and three-dimensional AFM images are shown in Fig. S2 and S3.† It can be seen that the roughness dramatically changed with the Ca2+ content in the perovskite precursor. Table 1 summarises the average roughness (Ra) of the films. Results show that the reference CsPbI3 (0% Ca) film has the rougher surface with an Ra of 67.1 nm, and that the benefits brought about by Ca are most evident when the Ca2+ molar ratio is 5%, as seen in the CsPb0.95Ca0.05I3 film, which has an Ra = 25.0 nm.

To understand the reason for these morphology changes, we investigated the effect of partial substitution of Pb2+ with Ca2+ on the CsPb1−xCaxI3 precursor solution using dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. Treating the perovskite precursor solutions as colloidal dispersions,26 the size of the colloids can be determined from the DLS measurements and the results for solutions with different molar ratios of Ca2+ are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the radius of the colloids in the reference sample (0% Ca) is predominantly 1.7 μm. As the molar ratio of Ca increases, the colloidal particle size is reduced to ≈1 μm. This could be due to Ca2+ being a hard Lewis acid similar to hydrogen, H+, compared to Pb2+, which is a soft acid, according to Lewis acid theory.27 Ca2+ might work similarly to hydrohalic acids, by triggering the dissolution of the colloids in the precursor solution, reducing the size of the colloids. The formation of these smaller colloids results in a more uniform distribution of the reactants, inducing better nucleation and crystallization of the perovskite film, which is smoother with a larger grain size.28,29

In order to understand the effect of Ca2+ content on the surface composition of perovskite films, an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study was performed and the results are shown in Fig. 4. As the molar ratio of Ca increases in the precursor, the presence of Ca2+ at the surface of the film subsequently formed is evident from the presence of Ca 2p peaks at 347.5 and 351 eV (Fig. 4a and its zoomed-in image).30 The peak intensity increases as the Ca content increases. In addition, the intensities of the Pb 4f peaks (Fig. 4b) and Cs 3d peaks (Fig. 4c) reduce significantly with increased Ca2+ content, especially when Ca2+ >5%. From the XPS results in Fig. 4 and S3,† we estimated the Ca/(Ca + Pb) atomic ratio at the surface and 50 nm into the film for the CsPb1−xCaxI3 film, where x is the molar ratio of Ca used in the precursor solution. The results are listed in Table 2. For the CsPb0.93Ca0.07I3 film, the Ca atomic ratio is 32% at the surface rather than 7% as anticipated. For the CsPb0.9Ca0.1I3 film, the Ca ratio at the surface is 70% rather than the expected 10%. This suggests that the film surface is enriched with Ca2+ after crystallisation and film formation of the perovskite. Surprisingly, the intensities of the C 1s (Fig. 4e) and O 1s (Fig. 4d) peaks increase with increased Ca2+ content, indicating the presence of an oxide layer with traces of carbon, which could be a mixture of CaO and CaCO3. The presence of CaO could be a result of a reaction between Ca2+ and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or H2O in dimethylformamide (DMF). With regards to CaCO3, its presence could be the result of a reaction between CaO and CO2, likely to be present due to the ambient conditions during transportation for XRD and XPS measurements.30 As the XRD peaks of CaCO3 are located in similar positions to the peaks of CsPbI3, it is hard to distinguish them in the XRD patterns.32 With an appropriate amount of the wider bandgap materials such as CaO (∼6.3 eV)33 or CaCO3 (7 eV)34 at the surface, recombination is suppressed, similar to how the passivation effect is caused by excess PbI2 in the perovskite.35 Interestingly, these observations are similar to those in previous studies. We have previously reported that when CsPbI2Br is incorporated with Sr, Sr enrichment was observed at the surface and XPS results indicated the possible formation of Sr oxides at the surface.16 For MAPbI3, Sr incorporation has also resulted in Sr enrichment at the perovskite surface with an increased amount of oxygen at the surface with traces of carbon, as shown by UPS and XPS results.31 In that work, the possible formation of thin SrO, SrCO, and Sr(C2H3O2)2 layers has been attributed to contributions from the precursor solution. In our work, although a small amount of lead replacement by Ca is beneficial, it was found that an excessive amount of Ca2+ (>5%) is detrimental to device performance due to the insulating nature of this oxide layer, which will be discussed later. To characterise the film further into the bulk, 50 nm was etched away from the surface using Ar ion etching. Results from the XPS measurements performed are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† The peaks of Ca 2p are present for the films when Ca2+ ≥5% in the precursor while the Cs 3d peaks remain constant regardless of the Ca2+ content. When Ca2+ <5% in the precursor, Ca 2p peaks can hardly be detected, indicating that there was insufficient Ca to be incorporated into the perovskite lattice. For the CsPb0.93Ca0.07I3 film, the Ca atomic ratio is around 5%, slightly lower than the 7% anticipated (Table 2). For the CsPb0.9Ca0.1I3 film, the Ca ratio is 7%, again slightly lower than the expected 10%. This suggests that the film 50 nm into the bulk has slightly less Ca2+ than that in the precursor solution, due to the accumulation of Ca2+ at the surface, as shown in previous results.

To investigate the effect of Ca2+ in the precursors on the opto-electronic properties of the perovskite film, reflection and transmission measurements and time-resolved photoluminescence (tr-PL) measurements were carried out on test perovskite film structures. The corresponding absorption curves shown in Fig. 5a show blue shifts in the perovskite films made from precursors with a Ca2+ molar ratio ≥5%. The (optical) bandgap is increased from 1.72 eV to 1.93 eV when the Ca2+ molar ratio is increased to 15% in the precursor. A noticeable sub bandgap is observed, possibly due to an increased number of defects in the perovskite. We have simulated the electronic band-structure and density of states for the CsPb0.875Ca0.125I3 and CsPbI3 supercells using the projector augmented wave method (Fig. S5 in the ESI†). Bandgap widening is observed for CsPb0.875Ca0.125I3 compared to that for CsPbI3 which is attributed to the mixing of wider bandgap states introduced by Ca–I bonds into the conduction and valence bands, generally defined by Pb–I bonds, upon the substitution of Ca in Pb lattice sites. Wang et al. have also conducted density function theory simulations on CsPbI3 when Pb is substituted by alkaline-earth metals and also reported an increase in bandgap.25

Fig. 5b shows the tr-PL decay curves for the perovskite films and Table 3 shows the corresponding carrier lifetime components extracted by fitting the curves with a bi-exponential function.36 Perovskite films made from precursors with 5% and 7% Ca2+ substitution have better effective lifetimes compared to those of the reference, CsPbI3, due to the improved film morphology including coverage and smoothness as shown in Fig. 2 and S1† and the effective passivation provided by the Ca rich oxide layer at the surface. However, if there is insufficient Ca2+ in the precursor, e.g. a molar ratio of 2%, there is no apparent benefit, as can be seen by the lower effective lifetime (Table 3), poorer coverage of the film (Fig. 2b) and rougher surface (Fig. S1b† and Table 1). This is because the amount of Ca is not sufficient to be incorporated into the perovskite lattice, as shown in the XPS results (Fig. 4a and S3a†), resulting in no bandgap change (Fig. 5a) but only a small red-shift as a result of the levels of defects introduced by the small amount of Ca, similar to what has been observed in stoichiometrically unbalanced CsPbI2Br.37

To confirm the benefits of Ca substitution on device performance, FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CsPb1−xCaxI3/P3HT/Au photovoltaic devices were fabricated. Fig. 6 and Table S1† show the distributions of the PCEs and the other parameters of the devices. The parameters of the champion devices are shown in brackets. Using precursors with 5% Ca2+ substitution, the resultant devices gave the best performance with an average PCE of 11% (Fig. S6 in the ESI†) and a champion PCE of 12.6%. Without Ca substitution, the reference devices have an average PCE of 9.4% and a best PCE of 10.6%. The significant improvement in PCE in Ca-incorporated devices comes from the improved VOC and FF due to better morphology, which in turn results in a better perovskite/HTM interface, a higher bandgap and surface passivation. Cell results confirm that 2% Ca in the precursor is insufficient to bring about any benefits and results in poorer performance (lower FF and lower VOC) due to (i) poorer surface coverage and therefore a poorer perovskite/HTM interface, and (ii) the absence of surface passivation due to the lack of Ca to enable the formation of Ca rich oxide. The small improvement in JSC could be due to scattering caused by the rougher perovskite layer. When Ca2+ ≥5% in the precursor, the JSC of the corresponding devices decreases due to the enlarged bandgap (Fig. 7a) and hence reduced absorption is seen in the measured external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) shown in Fig. 7b. When Ca2+ substitution is more than 10% in the precursor, the excessive Eg of the subsequent perovskite film and the excessive insulating oxide layer at the perovskite surface inhibit carrier transport between the perovskite and the HTM, leading to reductions in all electrical parameters in the corresponding devices. However, respectable performance can still be obtained (>6.7% PCE) when 15% of the Pb is replaced by Ca in the precursor solution.

(d) Stabilised output measured at the maximum power point (0.8 V) for the best performing device with MgF2. 
After applying a MgF2 anti-reflection coating, the PCE of the champion cell was 13.5% with a JSC of 17.9 mAcm−2, an VOC of 945 mV, and a FF of 80% under a reverse scan (Fig. 7c). Hysteresis is present in this device (Fig. S7 in the ESI†) but is anticipated to be eliminated in future devices as the performance of Cs perovskite devices continues to improve due to better cell design and fabrication methods, which will include various strategies of interface engineering. Nevertheless, a stabilized PCE of 13.3% was still achieved (Fig. 7d) which is very close to the reverse scanned value. This is not uncommon as others have also reported stabilized PCE values very close to38 or even higher than39,40 PCE values under a reverse scan. These are the best efficiencies and highest fill factors reported for a CsPbI3 perovskite solar cell to date (see Table S2 in the ESI†). The encapsulated device (with 5% Ca) also showed an outstanding stability, maintaining 85% of the initial PCE for over two months of storage in the dark at room temperature with a relative humidity of between 60% and 70%. The reference device (no Ca) under the same storage conditions only maintained 65% of the initial PCE (Fig. S8 in the ESI†).
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that Ca2+ substitution of lead in CsPbI3 precursor solution produces a perovskite film with a stabilised CsPbI3 phase and enhanced film quality in multiple aspects. Firstly, the presence of Ca2+ reduces the size of the colloids in the precursor solution, providing a more uniform distribution of the reactants for nucleation and film crystallisation, leading to larger grains and smoother films. As a result, a better interface between the perovskite and HTM is obtained, increasing the VOC and FF for the corresponding solar devices. Secondly, a Ca rich oxide layer forms at the surface, providing a passivating effect, leading to an increase in carrier lifetime. Thirdly, the bandgap increases with increasing Ca2+ content. The amount of Ca2+ substitution in the precursor solution is optimised in this work. It is found that a molar ratio of Ca2+ ≤2% is insufficient to cause an increase in the bandgap or to form an oxide passivation layer at the surface but results in rougher film with poorer surface coverage and a higher number of defects, confirmed by optical, XPS, SEM, AFM and tr-PL measurements. On the other hand, excessive Ca2+ in the precursor (≥10%) causes excessive insulating calcium oxide to be formed, inhibiting carrier transport between the perovskite and HTM layer. At the optimum concentration (5% Ca2+ in the precursor solution), the corresponding glass/FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/CsPb1−xCaxI3/P3HT/Au solar devices achieved an average efficiency of 11.0%. With an anti-reflection coating, the champion cell delivered a PCE of 13.5% under a reverse scan and a stabilized PCE of 13.3%. The encapsulated device also showed remarkable stability, maintaining 85% of the initial PCE for over two months. Also, the perovskite film made with 5% Ca2+ substitution in the precursor has a lower Pb content and a bandgap of 1.72 eV. The latter makes it a good candidate as a top cell in a double junction perovskite/Si tandem device. Our research provides an effective strategy for stabilising inorganic caesium metal halide perovskites and enhancing their solar performance and has the added benefit of producing solar cells with reduced lead content. This work has also provided insight into the underlying mechanism. The outcome is beneficial for further improvement of inorganic perovskite solar cells and their application in perovskite-silicon tandem devices.
