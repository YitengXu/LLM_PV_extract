    , Accepted 25th January 2012First published on 27th February 2012AbstractA series of Yb3+, Ho3+ codoped BaGdF5 with different morphologies (nanoparticles, peanut-like and capsule-like submicrocrystals) and sizes (37–900 nm) are prepared by a facile additive-assisted hydrothermal route. The crystal structure of BaGdF5 solid-solution is firstly established via the materials studio software and retrieved refinement of the powder XRD data. In addition, upconversion and downconversion luminescence properties of Yb3+, Ho3+ codoped BaGdF5 samples are studied, and the energy transfer (Yb3+ → Ho3+) efficiency of the sample with the strongest UC emission is also calculated. The measured field dependence of magnetization of the Yb3+, Ho3+ codoped BaGdF5 nanoparticles shows excellent paramagnetism. The above results show that versatile lanthanide nanoparticles with these properties combined in a single particle are of considerable importance in biomedical luminescence applications. The Raman spectrum of the BaGdF5 host is presented here, and the low phonon energy is mainly respond for the high UC and DC efficiency of the product.
1. Introduction
Low-dimensional nanoscale upconversion (UC) materials have attracted considerable attention during the past decade, not only for their underlying scientific interest but also for diverse applications, such as lasers, displays and especially biological labels.1–5 Recently, assembly of discrete nano-building blocks into controllable architectures and materials with advanced functions is of ever increasing importance in chemistry and materials science, owing to their great utilization in photochemistry, superconductors, optoelectronics, solar cells, and catalysis.6 Altogether, both UC nano- and micromaterials with diverse controllable morphologies are of special significance in their degree of potential applications. However, it is still a challenging and urgent task for us to manipulate and control the morphologies of various nano- and micromaterials due to the complexity of crystal structures and compositions of the materials.
Up to now, environmentally friendly synthetic methodologies, which include molten-salt synthesis, hydrothermal processing, and template synthesis,7 have gradually been implemented as viable techniques in the synthesis of a range of nano- and microstructures. In particular, the hydrothermal method has been proved an effective, relatively green, nontoxic, and convenient process.8 Unfortunately, the theory of hydrothermal synthesis with chelating agents or surfactants is not perfect, and there is still much room for the construction of various nanostructures and microarchitecture. Therefore it remains a challenge to select proper surfactants for the large-scale controlled synthesis of specific materials with unique architectures and properties.
At present, studies on UC are mostly limited to AREF4 (A = Na, K, RE = Y, Gd) hosts.9 However, BREF5 (B = Mg, Ba, Ca, Sr) as a new matrix has rarely been investigated compared to the former.10 In addition, the materials that possess both fluorescent and magnetic properties have attracted considerable attention due to their importance in the fields of chemistry, biology, and medical sciences in recent years.11 It is well known that Gd3+ ions have a 4f7 electronic configuration and their complexes are usually paramagnetic at room temperature, which is a common feature of positive contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging.12 Consequently, BaGdF5 as a fluoride containing Gd3+ ions, is expected to be an efficient magnetic–optical matrix, so we choose BaGdF5 as the object of this study. On the other hand, downconversion (DC) of near-infrared (NIR) luminescent properties have attracted more attention for their application in silicon solar cells by modifying the incident light wavelength,13 DC based on ion-couple systems such as Tb3+/Yb3+, Pr3+/Yb3+, Tm3+/Yb3+ codoped materials have been extensively investigated.14 In view of the energy level diagrams of Ho3+ and Yb3+, DC might be achieved in a Ho3+/Yb3+ couple. Unfortunately, regarding the crystallographic data, only the indexed XRD profile for BaGdF5 and the phase diagram of BaF2–GdF3 was described by Zhigarnovskii et al. in the 1970s.15 In addition, Ba1−0.5Gd0.5F2 + 0.5 (BaGdF5) is known as an anion-excessive compound and has a similar structure to calcium fluoride (CaF2) with a cubic system, and acts as a member of the M1 − xRxF2 + x (M = Ca, Sr, Ba, Cd, Pb; R = RE) solid-solution. The site-occupation of Gd3+ ions in BaGdF5 has not been studied in detail, though there are some reports about the structure of M1−xRxF2+x.16 It is especially important to investigate the crystal structure of BaGdF5, because the luminescence properties are strongly dependent on the local chemical environment of activator ions, such as coordination number, site symmetry and bond character, which ultimately depend on the crystal structure.17 More recently, Lin et al. prepared down-converting Ce3+/Ln3+ (Ln = Sm, Dy, Eu, Tb) doped BaGdF5 by hydrothermal method.18 However, as far as we know, there is not any study of effects of different surfactants on morphology, UC and DC properties in one compound of Yb3+, Ho3+ codoped BaGdF5.
The highlight of our work can be summarized as follows. By contrast, firstly, detailed structure information of the solid-solution BaGdF5 is primarily demonstrated in the current study. Secondly, the measured Raman spectrum is a direct evidence of the low phonon energy of this new host BaGdF5. Thirdly, effects of different surfactants, including cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and chelating agents, comprising ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA2−) and trisodium citrate (Cit3−), on the morphology, size, and UC luminescence are discussed. Moreover, the formation mechanisms of various morphologies are carefully investigated. Fourthly, a major motivation for this research has been the goal of exploring BaGdF5 material which could exhibit unique UC, DC, magnetic properties and potential applications in bio-imaging. The energy transfer from Yb3+ ions to Ho3+ ions and the back energy transfer from Ho3+ ions to Yb3+ ions under different excitation sources are also studied and calculated.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation
The BaGd1 − 0.1 − x%Yb0.1Hox%F5 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.1) samples were prepared by a hydrothermal process. Firstly, 1 mmol rare earth oxides Gd2O3, Yb2O3 and Ho2O3 were dissolved in dilute HNO3 solution and the residual HNO3 was removed by heating and evaporation, resulting in the formation of clear solution of RE(NO3)3 (RE = Gd, Yb, Ho). 2 mmol Cit3− was added into 10 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring until Cit3− was dissolved absolutely to form transparent solution a. Subsequently, 2 mmol of Ba(NO3)2·2H2O and a stoichiometric amount of RE(NO3)3 were dissolved in deionized water to form 15 mL solution b. Then solution a was added into solution b to form the solution c containing metal–Cit complex. After solution c was vigorously stirred for 30 min, 10 mL aqueous solution containing 4 mmol NaBF4 was poured into solution c, and the pH value of the mixture was adjusted to about 5.5 by adding diluted HCl or NH3·H2O. After additional agitation for 15 min, the as-obtained mixed solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon autoclave, which was tightly sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. As the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, the resulting precipitates were separated via centrifugation, washed three times with ethanol and deionized water, and finally dried in oven at 80 °C for 8 h. Other samples were prepared by the similar procedure, except for different organic additives and pH values.
2.2 Characterization
The XRD patterns were obtained on Rigaku D/max-2400 powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5405Å) at 40 kV and 60 mA. The size, shape and structure of the as-prepared nano/submicrocrystals were characterized by SEM (S-4800) and TEM (JSM-1200ex). FT-IR (NEXUS670) spectra of the as-synthesized nanoparticles were performed by using KBr method. In the measurements of UC emission and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, a continuous 980 nm laser diode (LD) with power maximum of 1.2 W and Xe lamp were used for excitation sources, respectively, and the visible emissions were collected using a HORIBA JOBIN YVON Fluorolog-3 Spectrofluorometer system. Products before and after heat treatment at 500 °C via micro-Raman spectrometer (Jobin-Yvon LabRAM HR800 UV, YGA 532 nm) were also investigated. The measurements of magnetic properties were made using vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, Lakeshore 7300). All the measurements were performed at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure of BaGdF5
In the crystal structure of BaGdF5 solid-solution, it is generally regarded that 50 mol% Ba2+ ions are replaced by Gd3+ ions in the BaF2 structure. F− ions mainly occupy anion sites; subsequently, the excess F− ions fill interstitial sites to compensate for the excess positive charge from Gd3+ ions, resulting in the stable structure.19 It is worth pointing out that some F− ions could displace from the anion site and cause the structure relaxation and distortion. Ba2+ ions occupy the cation sites, that is to say, Ba2+ ions occupy face–centered and the corner sites, so there are two possibilities for the Gd3+ ion substitution for Ba2+ ions: one is that Gd3+ ions substitute one kind of Ba2+ site, such as the face–centered site or the corner only, and the other one is that the Gd3+ ions replace every site of Ba2+ ions with the same possibility. We select each of them to establish the structure model of BaGdF5, which are shown in the following.
Firstly, Gd3+ ions substitute only one kind of Ba2+ sites: the face-centered sites or the corner sites of the Ba2+ ions. For the corner sites of the Ba2+ ions, that is, the eight corner sites and two opposite face-centered positions of Ba2+ ions (the two opposite face-centered sites in one BaF2 unit cell equal to the corner sites of Ba2+ ions in another BaF2 unit cell) in BaF2 unit cell, the corresponding crystal structure was constructed with the help of the materials studio software, as shown in Fig. 1a, and the corresponding front view of a single unit cell is shown in Fig. 1b. It is clear to see from Fig. 1b that the ordered arrangement of Ba2+ ions and Gd3+ ions leads to crystal lattice distortion, because the nonequivalent substitution results in the F− ion relaxation. The detailed projection of only one cationic layer is shown in Fig. 1c. Filled circles indicate Ba2+ cations; light ones, Gd3+ cations. To simplify the drawing, no anions are indicated. However, through the simulated powder diffraction of this structure using the software of materials studio, some weak peaks appear in the simulated XRD patterns which didn't exist in the corresponding PDF card or the experimental data, such as the obvious peak located at around 15° (2θ) (Fig. 1d). If Gd3+ ions only replace the face-centered sites of the Ba2+ ions, according to the stoichiometric ratio, there exist two Ba2+ and two Gd3+ ions in one BaGdF5 unit cell and considering the face-centered ions are shared by two unit cells, Gd3+ ions will substitute two pairs of opposite face-centered position of Ba2+ ions in BaF2 unit cell, such as (0, 1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 0, 1/2), (1, 1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 1, 1/2). If the unit cell is carried on a translation operation (1/2, 0, 1/2), the crystal structure will be the same as that described in Fig. 1a and b. So the above results do not support the assumption that Gd3+ ions substitute only one kind of Ba2+ sites.

So, on the other hand, Gd3+ ions may substitute every site of Ba2+ ions with the same probability, and the corresponding projection of the only one cationic layer is shown in the Fig. 2a. The simulated XRD profiles are in accordance with the PDF card (see Fig. 2b), suggesting the above assumption is suitable, but some detailed parameters need to be refined. The analyses of X-ray diffraction by the Rietveld method using the materials studio program have been determined as shown in Fig. 2c. The Rietveld refinement details for BaGdF5 solid-solution are presented in Table 1. The final fitting factors are Rp = 4.97%, Rwp = 6.62%, which are within the accepted error range, indicating that this assumed structure of BaGdF5 is conceivable.20

3.2 Effect of EDTA2− and Cit3− as chelating agents
It is well known that the controlled release of RE3+ ions from an RE-EDTA (RE-Cit) complex helps to separate the nucleation and growth stages, and the capping of EDTA2− (Cit3−) on the surface of prepared nanoparticles prevents further aggregation.21 Considering these two advantages, EDTA2− (Cit3−) was firstly selected as chelating agent in the synthetic process. The XRD profiles of products in Fig. 3a are obtained by taking the EDTA2− and Cit3− as chelating agent under pH = 5.5, respectively. It is obvious that the locations and relative intensities of the diffraction peaks coincide well with the data reported in the JCPDS standard card (JCPDS No. 24-0098). No additional peaks of other phases are found, indicating that the pure-phase BaGdF5 is obtained. Moreover, when Gd3+ ions are substituted by RE3+ ions (RE = Yb, Ho) which have smaller radii, the diffraction peaks of the corresponding XRD patterns shift right with respect to those reported by the PDF card, probably due to the radii of Yb3+ and Ho3+ ions being smaller than that of Gd3+ ion, which indicate that dopant ions are successfully involved in the crystal lattice.22 Moreover, high crystallinity could be obtained at relatively low synthesis temperature (180 °C), which is important for phosphors, since higher crystallinity always means fewer traps and stronger luminescence.23 Furthermore, the XRD peaks have very broad width, resulting from the ultrasmall size of the samples.24
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of the as-prepared BaGdF5 products using EDTA2− and Cit3− as the chelating agent, respectively (a); TEM (b) and SAED (c) images of BaGdF5 nanoparticles using EDTA2− as chelate; SEM (d) and SAED (e) images of BaGdF5 nanoparticles using Cit3− as chelate; EDX of BaGdF5 nanoparticles (f). 
It is found that the particles have a nearly uniform spherical shape with a diameter of 74 nm and are well dispersed when treated with EDTA2− (Fig. 3b). The crystal structure of the individual nanoparticle is further characterized by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 3c) and HRTEM (inset of Fig. 3c). The lattice is arranged in one direction which can be clearly observed from the HRTEM image and the diffraction spots in the SAED image constructing parallelogram arrays, indicating that the nanoparticles are single-crystalline and consistent with the face-centered cubic structure.25 When using other chelating reagents, such as Cit3−, the nanoparticles are formed with a quite uniform size of 37 nm and are relatively better dispersed (see Fig. 3d). SAED patterns in Fig. 3e show clear diffraction rings corresponding to the specific (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400) and (331) planes of the cubic structure BaGdF5. SAED patterns confirm polycrystalline nature due to observation of diffraction rings as opposed to discrete spots, which is different from that of the samples prepared using EDTA2−. The inset of Fig. 3e displays typical HRTEM image of the polycrystalline nanoparticles, and the distance between the lattice fringes was measured to be ∼0.353 nm, which corresponds to the d-spacing for the (111) lattice plane of the cubic BaGdF5 structure. Fig. 3f presents further energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and it confirms that the major constituents of the as-prepared nanoparticles are Ba, Gd, F, and Si which comes from the silicon pellet. The above results indicate that the chelating agents have a remarkably different impact on the morphologies of the final products, which might be related to the differences of the chelating constant with Ba2+ (Gd3+).26
The role of EDTA2− and Cit3− in our case can be suggested as follows: Ba2+ (Gd3+) and EDTA2− could form Ba-EDTA (Gd2(EDTA)3) complex, the free Ba2+ (Gd3+) ion concentration would decrease in solution. With increasing reaction temperature and time under hydrothermal conditions, chelation of the Ba (Gd)-EDTA or Ba (Gd)-Cit complex would be weakened and Ba2+ (Gd3+) ions would be released gradually. Therefore, the nucleation and growth of BaGdF5 would go through a longer process, which would be helpful in forming uniform crystals. Take EDTA2− for instance, the probable reaction processes for the formation of BaGdF5 spherical shape may be summarized as eqn (1)–(5): C10H14N2O8Na·2H2O → 2Na+ + EDTA2−(1) Ba2+ + EDTA2− → Ba-EDTA (complex)(2) 2Gd3+ + 3EDTA2− → Gd2(EDTA)3 (complex)(3) BF4− + 3H2O → 3HF + F− + H3BO3(4) (5)
3.3 Effect of other different additives on morphology and size of the products
Organic additives play important roles not only in biomimetic synthesis but also in various solution-phase synthetic processes to control nucleation, growth, crystallization and morphology of materials.27 Herein, we focus our attention on the influence of non-ionic surfactant (PVP), cationic surfactant (CTAB) and anionic surfactant (SDBS) instead of the chelating agents on the morphology of the products, while other experimental conditions remained unchanged. The XRD patterns of the products are depicted in Fig. 4a. It can be seen that the XRD peaks match very well with the standard cubic BaGdF5 crystal structure data. Unfortunately, some impurities of the BaF2 phase exist in the initial product with SDBS as dispersant, but the nearly single-phase BaGdF5 sample is finally obtained after being washed twice with diluted hydrochloric acid and dried in an oven at 80 °C.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of the as-prepared BaGdF5:10% Yb3+, 0.8% Ho3+ products using different surfactants (a); SEM image of BaGdF5:10% Yb3+, 0.8% Ho3+ using PVP (b); CTAB (c); SDBS (before washing (d), after washing (inset of (d)). 
Interestingly, peanut and capsule-like submicrocrystals instead of nanoparticles are obtained using PVP and CTAB as dispersing agents, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4b and c. It is necessary to point out that the surface of the individual submicrocrystals is not smooth, and contains many small nanoparticles, which aggregate in a special form to self-assemble into the ordered morphology. In addition, SEM images of the obtained products using PVP as dispersing agent with different hydrothermal times are shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† Unexpectedly, when SDBS is chosen as a dispersant, toothpick shape of the microcrystals are not remained, but replaced by aggregated nanoparticles if the as-prepared samples are washed with diluted hydrochloric acid (see Fig. 4d), during which the morphology is destroyed. The detailed synthetic conditions and relevant results are listed in Table 2.

All these differences could be related to varied additives. It is well known that facets with high surface energies are easily blocked by foreign surfactants,28 thus, the surface energies can be effectively reduced, and the growth mode can be controlled. These results further indicated that EDTA2− and Cit3− mostly acted as the chelating agents but hardly adsorbed on the surfaces of BaGdF5 crystal nuclei to induce their anisotropic growth, and couldn't direct self-assembly of microcrystals with some shape, either. Herein we propose a possible mechanism for the formation of different nanoparticles or microarchitectures as shown in Scheme 1.27f,g,28e,f,g

3.4 UC emission properties

3.4.1 UC emission properties of nano/submicrocrystals. 

Fig. 5 presents the UC luminescence spectra of the resulting BaGdF5:10%Yb3+, 0.8% Ho3+ nano/submicrocrystals with different sizes and morphologies. It can be seen clearly that all the emission spectra are similar in shape, but the emission intensities exhibit quite differently. The capsule-like microcrystals demonstrate the highest relative intensity, followed by that of peanut-like microcrystals, but the nanoparticles prepared using Cit3− and EDTA2− show the lowest intensity, and the relative intensity is almost 12 times as low as that of the submicrocrystals. We ascribe the difference of relative luminescence intensity to the different morphologies and sizes of the samples, owing to the fact that morphologies and crystallinity would greatly influence the luminescence properties of inorganic materials. Irregular and nano-crystals possess a larger surface area and higher surface energy, which not only form the main impetus for assembly, but also result in a higher degree of disorder of crystal fields.28a On the other hand, as the samples were prepared in water, the surface of the BaGdF5 nanoparticles may be covered with hydroxyl species, which act as efficient quenchers of the excited Ho3+ ions. There are several reports concerning the effects of different morphologies and sizes on UC emission intensity of the products with the same crystal structure,29 that is to say, products with more regular morphology and bigger size would exhibit stronger UC emission.

3.4.2 UC emission properties of a series of BaGdF5:10%Yb3+, x%Ho3+ (after heat treatment). 

Fig. 6 illustrates the UC emission spectra of a series of BaGdF5:10% Yb3+, x% Ho3+ (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 1.1). The predominant green (534–543 nm) UC emission is due to the 5F4, 5S2 → 5I8 transitions of Ho3+ ions. The weaker red (647 nm) and NIR (751 nm) UC emissions are ascribed to the 5F5 → 5I8 and 5F4, 5S2 → 5I7 transitions of Ho3+ ions, respectively. Especially for the blue emission, the intensity of this peak is so weak that it could not be observed in many hosts. From the inset of Fig. 6, one can see that the relatively weaker peak in the blue region around 485 nm is due to the 5F3 → 5I8 transition of Ho3+ ions, but not the cooperative emission of Yb3+ ions, because no blue emission exists in the BaGdF5:10% Yb3+ sample in our experiment. The overall UC emission intensity drastically increases with increasing Ho3+ concentration until the concentration of Ho3+ reaches 0.8 mol%. It is important to mention that the UC luminescence in BaGdF5:0.8% Ho3+, 10% Yb3+ sample is intense enough to be seen at excitation power density as low as 8.5W cm−2.
 Fig. 6  Upconversion emission spectra of BaGdF5:10% Yb3+, x% Ho3+ (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 1.1). 
From the inset of Fig. 6, it appears that the emission intensity of all the emission peaks increase, but the intensity ratio of red emission to green emission (R/G) decreases when the samples are annealed at 500 °C for 3 h. The reasons are discussed in the following.
To better understand the mechanisms by which the 5F3, 5S2/5F4, 5F5 (Ho3+) states are populated and the reasons for the above phenomenon, the pump power dependence of UC emissions is measured, as shown in Fig. 7. It is well known that the UC luminescence intensity (IUP) is related to the pump infrared one (IIR) via the following formula:30IUP∝InIRwhere n is the number of photons required to populate the emitting states. It shows that two-photon processes are involved to produce the blue, green, red and NIR UC emission in Yb3+, Ho3+ codoped BaGdF5. The n value of 5F3 → 5I8 UC emission is equal approximately to 2, while the 5F5 → 5I8, 5F4, 5S2 → 5I7, and 5F4, 5S2 → 5I8 UC emission exhibited power dependence close to 1.6, 1.6, 1.7, indicating a “saturated” two-photon absorption mechanism. Since UC is a nonlinear process, it could not maintain its nonlinear behaviour up to infinite excitation energy as a consequence of the conservation of energy. As such, the dependence of UC luminescence intensity on pump power is expected to level off to a linear behaviour with increasing excitation power, and a “saturation” of the luminescence intensity is observed for higher pump powers. Pollnau et al. attributed the decrease of n to the competition between linear decay and UC processes for the depletion of the intermediate excited states.31 All three plots exhibited no inflection points thereby ruling out photon avalanche UC.32
 Fig. 7  Pump power dependence of the blue, green, red and NIR UC emissions in BaGdF5:10% Yb3+, 0.8% Ho3+. 

Fig. 8 shows the energy level diagrams of Yb3+, Ho3+ and UC luminescence processes under LD excitation at 980 nm. Firstly, the ground state electrons of 5I8 are excited to 5I6 of Ho3+ ions through the energy transfer from Yb3+ ions or ground state absorption. In this process, the energy transfer Yb3+ → Ho3+ should be dominant because Yb3+ ions have strong and wide absorption around 980 nm. Some electrons on 5I6 are excited to 5S2/5F4 through energy transfer or excited state absorption, generating the green emission of 5S2/5F4 → 5I8, while the others relax into 5I7 originating NIR emission and then are excited to 5F5 through energy transfer or excited state absorption, generating the red emission of 5F5 → 5I8.33 The nonradiative relaxation of 5S2/5F4 → 5F5 is the other path for populating the 5F5 level to emit red light. In terms of the decrease of R/G mentioned above, the main reason is the decreasing nonradiative relaxations of 5I6 → 5I7 and 5S2 (5F4)→5F5, which finally decrease the population in 5F5 state of Ho3+. FT-IR spectra were employed as an additional probe to testify the presence of quenching groups of the sample, as shown in Fig. 8b. It can be seen that before heat treatment, a great number of surface defects such as CO32− (1640 cm−1) and OH− (3438 cm−1) are observed,29c but after calcinations at 500 °C, the intensity of peaks of CO32− and OH− decreases dramatically, resulting in the above two nonradiative relaxations decreasing correspondingly, finally the R/G decreased.34 It can also be seen that the band around 466 cm−1 is assigned to the vibration of the BaGdF5 solid-solution. For the blue emission of 5F3 → 5I8, two probable ways are involved. First, 5F3 level of Ho3+ ions can be populated by 5F5 level through cross relaxation shown by channel A in Fig. 8a. Second, cooperative energy of pairs of excited Yb3+ ions may also be transferred to Ho3+ ions and promote them to the 5F3 level.

3.4.3 The energy transfer efficiency. 
As described above, the BaGdF5:10%Yb3+, 0.8% Ho3+ sample has the highest emission intensity, and the energy transfer efficiency (η) from Yb3+ to Ho3+ ions could be calculated in the following. Fig. 9 shows the decay curves for BaGdF5:10% Yb3+ and BaGdF5:10%Yb3+, 0.8% Ho3+ samples, which deviate from double exponential and thus are fitted with the equation proposed by Nakazawa:35  where τm is the effective decay time constant, and I(t) is the intensity at time t. The η of Yb3+ to Ho3+ ions is defined as the ratio of Yb3+ ions that depopulate by energy transfer to Ho3+ over the total number of Yb3+ ions excited. Thus, using this formula, the lifetimes of 2F5/2 state of Yb3+ ions in BaGdF5:10% Yb3+ and BaGdF5:10% Yb3+, 0.8% Ho3+ samples are obtained. The lifetime of the 2F5/2 excited state of Yb3+ ions changes considerably in the presence and absence of Ho3+ ions. The lifetime (λex = 980 nm) of the 2F5/2 state (Yb3+) in BaGdF5:10% Yb3+ was determined to be 652.6 μs. However, when 0.8% Ho3+ was added to the matrix, a lifetime of 425.5 μs was obtained for the 2F5/2 state of Yb3+ ions in BaGdF5:0.8% Ho3+, 10% Yb3+ sample. We can calculate the Yb3+ → Ho3+ energy transfer efficiency (ητ) by36  where τDA (425.5 μs) is the lifetime of the donor (D, Yb3+) in the presence of the acceptor (A, Ho3+) and τD (652.6 μs) is the lifetime of the donor in the absence of the acceptor. Thus, the efficiency of the energy transfer was determined to be 0.348.

3.5 DC photoluminescence
It can be seen from Fig. 10 that the excitation and emission spectral shape of Ho3+ singly doped and Ho3+, Yb3+ codoped BaGdF5 samples are similar. The excitation spectra are composed of the characteristic f–f transition lines within the Ho3+ ions configuration. Basically, the main excitation lines can be assigned to the transitions from the 5I8 ground state to the different excited states of Ho3+ ions, i.e., 360 nm (3H5), 384 nm (5G4), 415 nm (5G5), 450 nm (5G6), 467 nm (3K8), 472 nm (5F2), and 484 nm (5F3). Upon excitation at 450 nm, the obtained emission spectra exhibited three obvious lines at 530–556, 640–655, and 749 nm. Hence, the BaGdF5 phosphor has potential applications in LEDs.37 However, the intensity of both emission and excitation of Ho3+ singly doped BaGdF5 is much stronger than that of Ho3+, Yb3+ codoped sample, which is opposite to the UC emission spectra. In the inset of Fig. 10, a portion of the NIR emission spectrum of BaGdF5:0.8% Ho3+, 10% Yb3+ between 900 and 1300 nm is observed. The band in the 900–1100 nm region is ascribed to the Yb3+ 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 emission, which undoubtedly occurs via energy transfer from Ho3+ to Yb3+ ions, because the Yb3+ ion possesses only one excited state (2F5/2) centered at approximately 1000 nm, and there cannot be a direct population of the upper 2F5/2 energy state of Yb3+ ions through the use of the 450 nm excitation. The other NIR emission around 1189 nm is attributed to 5I6 → 5I8 transition of Ho3+ ions.28d These results show that the excitation energy absorbed by Ho3+ ions can be efficiently transferred to Yb3+ ions in BaGdF5:Ho3+,Yb3+, which indicates the NIR quantum cutting (QC) phenomenon may exist in the Yb3+, Ho3+ codoped BaGdF5 samples on the basis of the NIR QC model reported in the literature,38 and more experiments should be carried out to test and verify this assumption. If so, the BaGdF5 would be a multifunctional material.

3.6 Raman spectra of BaGdF5 host before and after heat treatment
Raman spectra can be used to characterize the phonon energies of materials. The Stokes Raman spectra (λex = 532 nm) of BaGdF5 host before and after sintering at 500 °C for 3 h are shown in Fig. 11. The sample did not contain rare earth dopants in order to prevent their photoluminescence obscuring the much weaker Raman signal. One can clearly see two strong Raman peaks around 328 cm−1 and 457 cm−1, which is basically in agreement with the FT-IR spectra mentioned above. The phonon energy of BaGdF5 is considerably lower than those of comparable fluoride host lattices, such as LiYF4 (570 cm−1).39 Probably the dominant electron–phonon coupling to this surprisingly low energy phonon mode is for a large part responsible for the fact that BaGdF5 is such a suitable host lattice for efficient UC with different rare earth ions.40 It is worth pointing out that before heat treatment, the peaks have broader width and weaker intensity relative to those after heat treatment, originating from the small size of nanoparticles and low crystallinity, respectively. In addition, redshift of the Raman peaks in BaGdF5 nanoparticles was observed before heat treatment, this may be due to spatial confinement of phonon modes.41

3.7 Paramagnetic properties of GdF3 and BaGdF5 nanoparticles
Apart from the excellent performance of exhibiting UC emissions, the Yb3+, Ho3+ codoped BaGdF5 nanoparticles using Cit3− as chelating agent also exhibit paramagnetism at 293 K (applied field ranges from −11.5 to 11.5 kOe), as shown in Fig. 12. The magnetization of BaGdF5, the particle size of which is about 37 nm, is around 0.7 emu g−1 at 10 kOe, which is near to the reported value 1.0 emu g−1 at 10 kOe of the nanoparticles used for common bio-separation,42 and it is also found that the magnetization is unaffected by doping the RE3+ (RE = Yb, Ho) luminescent centers. The magnetic properties of the Gd3+ ions come from seven unpaired inner 4f electrons, which are closely bound to the nucleus and effectively shielded by the outer closed shell electrons 5s25p6 from the crystal field. It turns out that the magnetic moments associated with the Gd3+ ions are all localized and noninteracting giving rise to paramagnetism. In contrast to the iron oxides, the RE3+ ions doped BaGdF5 nanoparticles exhibit both intrinsic luminescent and magnetic properties, indicating its potential applications in bioseparation and magnetic resonance imaging.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a series of 10% Yb3+, x% Ho3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.1) codoped BaGdF5 nano/submicrocrystals with different morphologies and sizes are synthesized by a facile hydrothermal approach. The structure information of BaGdF5 solid-solution is obtained as the BaF2 cubic system with Gd3+ ions occupying Ba2+ sites with the same possibility. Nanoparticles, capsule-like, and peanut-like microcrystals are obtained and sizes of the samples can be tuned from 37 to 900 nm using different chelating agents and surfactants. The optimum doping concentration of Ho3+ ions is found to be 0.8 mol%, and the energy transfer efficiency is calculated to be 0.348. A study of the UC power dependence indicates that the 5F3, 5S2/5F4 and 5F5 excited states of Ho3+ are populated via a two-photon process following energy transfer from excited Yb3+ ions, and the value of R/G decreases after heat treatment, owing to the nonradiative relaxation of 5I6 → 5I7 and 5S2 (5F4)→5F5 rate reduces. Moreover, the DC luminescence is observed at the range of 500–1200 nm upon excitation at 450 nm, due to the emissions of Ho3+ and Yb3+. The measured magnetization value of BaGdF5 nanoparticles is close to the reported values of other nanoparticles for bio-separation. Yb3+, Ho3+ codoped BaGdF5 with higher UC, DC luminescence efficiency and paramagnetic properties could be promising candidates to meet the requirements of high-contrast in vitro (vivo) imaging, bioseparation, and so on.
