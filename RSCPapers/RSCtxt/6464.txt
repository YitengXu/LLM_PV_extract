    , Accepted 7th June 2012First published on 11th June 2012AbstractThe construction of branched coumarin dyes based on a 2D-π-A system is focused to optimize the light-harvesting capability and enhance the photovoltaic performance. Three novel coumarin dyes, coded as MS-C, MS-F, and MS-M, respectively, were obtained by incorporating different units (carbazole, fluorene and methyl groups) with different molecular volume and degrees of electron-donating capability into the π-conjugation linker. Through molecular engineering, their light-harvesting capabilities, energy levels and photovoltaic performance were studied systematically. As expected, with the additional donor, especially utilizing strong electron-donating carbazole unit, the IPCE action spectrum of MS-C keeps a high plateau from 390 nm to 580 nm with nearly unity values. Along with the improvement of IPCE, the Jsc values of the three dyes were increased by 77% from 7.61 (MS-M) to 13.47 mA cm−2 (MS-C). Using DCA as the co-adsorbed material, the Jsc of MS-M was increased while these values were decreased in the cases of branched MS-C and MS-F. This means that the twist structure arising from the branched donors could prevent π-aggregation effectively. More importantly, the Voc was also improved significantly by introducing the additional donor. While the branched 2D-π-A system was constructed, the Voc was sharply increased from 508 (MS-M) to 610 mV (MS-C). Comprehensively, a more than 100% enhancement in overall conversion efficiency (5.53%) was realized by branched MS-C compared to the linear MS-M (2.74%). Although the overall conversion efficiencies of these dyes are not very high, these results will still afford significant value for future development of efficient coumarin sensitizers with high open-circuit voltage.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their high performance and the potential for low-cost production.1 As the critical component of DSSCs, ruthenium dyes produce an overall photo-electrical conversion efficiency (η) of higher than 10% due to their broad photoresponse area.2 Although the efficiencies of metal-free organic dyes are still lower than those of classic ruthenium dyes, they have also been extensively explored in recent years due to their low material costs, ease of synthesis and modification, high molar extinction coefficients, and environmentally friendly characteristics.3
Owing to the good photoresponse in the visible region, long-term stability under one sun illumination, and appropriate lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, coumarin based dyes are a kind of promising sensitizers and have been studied in detail.4 To date, NKX-2700 dye, connecting coumarin donor moiety and cyanoacetic acid by methenyl and thiophene units, is the most successful coumarin sensitizer, and obtained maximum η of up to 8.2%.4d However, while adsorbed on TiO2 electrode, the onset wavelength is only around 700 nm. More important, without co-adsorbed material, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of most coumarin dyes are still lower than 600 mV.4a,d,e But the addition of DCA will reduce the amount of dye-loaded and largely affect the photocurrent. Therefore, there is still much work to do for coumarin dyes to harvest all visible light and enhance the Vocvia molecular structure modification.
In metal-free organic sensitizers, the traditional linear donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A) system is the most common character, which consists of donor, π-conjugation linker, and acceptor parts. Recently, organic dyes based on branched D-π-A construction have been reported by several groups.5 Especially for sensitizers with double-donor units, the absorption peak will be red-shifted as well as the enhancement of molar extinction coefficient. Moreover, this kind of branched structure could afford higher photo-stability than that of linear D-π-A construction.5a,b
With above consideration, in this work, we present two novel coumarin sensitizers based on a branched 2D-π-A system, labelled as MS-C and MS-F (as shown in Scheme 1). As far as we know, such a branched 2D-π-A system was first constructed for coumarin dyes. Our strategy is to construct the branched 2D-π-A system with high electron-donating ability to broaden the photoresponse area and enhance the Voc without any co-adsorbed material. MS-M was also synthesized in the same way. Due to the small volume and weak electron-donating capability of methyl group, the reference dye MS-M can be regarded as a traditional linear D-π-A system. Molecular engineering was performed on the additional donor by introducing three different units (carbazole, fluorene and methyl groups) with different molecular volume and degree in electron-donating capability, thus giving a systematical improvement in the light harvesting capability and photovoltaic performance. The thiophene unit was applied as a π-linker segment, and cyanoacetic acid was used as the acceptor moiety.

With molecular engineering, the IPCE performance was improved effectively. More importantly, the Voc was also enhanced to a considerable extent. Based on a traditional linear D-π-A system, MS-M presented a Voc value of 508 mV without any co-adsorbed material under AM1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2). When the branched 2D-π-A systems were constructed, the Voc values were increased to 561 mV (MS-F), and further increased to 610 mV (MS-C) while high electron-donating carbazole group was introduced. The Voc and electron lifetime as a function of electron density were also measured and studied to figure out the effect of chemical structure on photovoltage. Along with more favorable IPCE spectrum and higher Voc, MS-C showed a more than 100% improvement in overall conversion efficiency (5.53%) compared to the reference linear MS-M (2.74%).
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Carbazole and fluorene groups were utilized as the additional donors separately to construct the branched 2D-π-A system. The planarity of both carbazole and fluorene segments is favorable to the delocalization and transfer of π-conjugated electrons. A methyl group was also introduced in the same way. Using compound 1 as the starting material, all these dyes were obtained in a five-step procedure as shown in Scheme 2. Intermediates 2 and 3 were synthesized by following the reported method.4b Through classic Suzuki coupling reactions, carbazole, fluorene, and methyl groups were introduced into thiophene unit of intermediate 3 (4-C/F/M). The Vilsmeier–Haack reaction was then performed to formylate the thiophene unit (5-C/F/M). To determine the position of the aldehyde group (C3 or C4 in 4-C/F/M, Scheme 2), the H–H COSY spectrum was measured (take 5-M for example, Fig. 1). Obviously, the hydrogen atom at C4 of thiophene (Hc) is related to the hydrogen atom of the methyl group (Hd). Therefore, the aldehyde group was introduced into the C3 of thiophene unit. Finally, MS-C, MS-F, and MS-M were obtained through Knoevenagel reactions with cyanoacetic acid. All these sensitizers were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HR-MS.

Photophysical and electrochemical characterization
The UV-vis absorption spectra of MS-C, MS-F, and MS-M in chloroform and on 4 μm TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 2 and also summarized in Table 1. Due to the relatively small volume of the methyl group, the reference dye MS-M can be regarded as a traditional linear D-π-A system. Thus, there is only one peak in the visible region, found at 467 nm with high extinction coefficients (30000 M−1 cm−1). For MS-F, there is still a single peak at 478 nm (32000 M−1 cm−1) in the visible region. The electron-donating ability of fluorene is too weak to show an obvious intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect. Thus, these two peaks can be ascribed to the ICT process between the coumarin group and the acceptor part. In the case of MS-C, due to the much stronger electron-donating ability of carbazole, there are two peaks appearing in the visible region: (1) part of the ICT peak between the carbazole donor part and the cyanoacetic acid acceptor part (λ = 395 nm, 44000 M−1 cm−1); (2) ICT peak between the coumarin donor part and the cyanoacetic acid acceptor part (shoulder peak, λ = 507 nm, 23000 M−1 cm−1). UV absorption peaks (ca. 290–340 nm) were attributed to localized aromatic π–π* transitions. The emission peaks of MS-C, MS-F, and MS-M were found at 714, 625, and 617 nm, respectively, which lay in the same order with the maximum absorption peaks (λmax). While adsorbed on 4 μm TiO2 electrode, the λmax of all three dyes are blue-shifted to different extents because of the deprotonation effect.4c Compared with MS-F and MS-M, the onset wavelength of MS-C is red-shifted by 60 nm to around 750 nm. Thus, the introduction of the carbazole group will be obviously beneficial for harvesting more light in the visible region.

Meanwhile, along with the increase of molecular volume, the amount of dye-loaded was decreased from 1.96 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for MS-M to 1.24 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for MS-F and 1.43 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for MS-C, respectively. Although the amounts of MS-F and MS-C are lower than that of MS-M, much more favorable absorption spectra still give them better light harvesting capabilities, especially for MS-C.
Cyclic voltammograms were performed to evaluate the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dye molecule to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and the regeneration of oxidized sensitizers. HOMO levels of three dyes were in the order MS-F < MS-M < MS-C and are determined to be 0.93, 0.99, and 1.09 V vs. NHE, respectively (Table 2). LUMO levels of all three dyes are more negative than −1.00 V vs. NHE and were also in the order MS-F < MS-M < MS-C. Generally, a minimal driving force of 0.2 V is sufficient to ensure fast excited-state injection and regeneration of the oxidized dye.7 Thus, the excited electron injection of all three dyes is guaranteed to be efficient as well as the regeneration of the oxidized dyes.

To gain insight into the electronic properties of the dyes, density functional calculations were conducted using the Gaussian 03 program package at the B3LYP/6-31 G* level. It is clearly seen from Fig. 3 that the electron of the HOMO orbital is delocalized over the whole molecule while the LUMO orbital is mainly localized at the acceptor moiety, suggesting that after being illuminated by the light, the excited electrons could be successively transferred to the acceptor part and then injected into the CB of TiO2.

Photovoltaic performance studies
Using the 12 μm TiO2 film with 4 μm scattering layer as photoanode, the IPCE action spectra and I–V curves of DSSCs based on MS-C and MS-F have been evaluated under AM1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2). Measurements have also been performed on DSSC based on the reference dye MS-M under the same conditions.
In good agreement with absorption spectra, MS-M gives the poorest IPCE performance (Fig. 4). The maximum value in the visible region was obtained as 62% at 470 nm. In contrast, the IPCE action spectra of MS-C and MS-F with branched construction are more favorable than that of linear MS-M as a result of better adsorption spectra. Owing to the higher electron-donating ability of carbazole, the IPCE of MS-C is much broader than that of MS-F, keeping an high plateau in visible region from 390 nm to 580 nm with a maximum value (81%) at 480 nm. Taking the absorption and reflection of the FTO glass into account,3gMS-C presents near unity IPCE values in this area (about 80%), guaranteeing high short-circuit current density. The onset wavelength in IPCE action spectrum for MS-C is at around 750 nm while it is around 670 nm for MS-F and MS-M.

Along with the IPCE action spectrum which was optimized, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) was also improved from 7.61 (MS-M) to 10.50 mA cm−2 (MS-F), and finally improved to 13.47 mA cm−2 (MS-C) (Fig. 5 and Table 3). There is a 77% enhancement in Jsc of MS-C with respect to MS-M. Obviously, this increase benefits from the broad and high IPCE performance. As expected, the construction of branched 2D-π-A system, especially by introducing a carbazole group with high electron-donating ability, could indeed improve Jsc.

To further evaluate the effect of branched 2D-π-A system for anti-aggregation, 5 mM DCA was added to the dye solution as the co-adsorbed material. The I–V data are collected in Table 3. After co-adsorbing with 5 mM DCA, MS-M showed a higher Jsc value than that without DCA, which means π-aggregation was formed on the TiO2 surface due to the planar π-conjugation of MS-M. In the cases of MS-C and MS-F, the Jsc values were decreased while DCA was present, indicating that there was no significant π-aggregation on the surface of TiO2 film. Fig. 6 shows the optimized ground state geometry of MS-C and MS-F. The dihedral angles between thiophene unit and the additional donor group were calculated to be 27.6° for MS-C and 25.2° for MS-F. Consequently, these twisted structures arising from the branched 2D-π-A construction prevent aggregation effectively.

Besides Jsc, the Voc was also affected by the molecular structure to a great extent. The Voc value of linear MS-M was obtained as 508 mV, which is lower than that of branched MS-F (561 mV) by 53 mV. Using a carbazole group as the additional donor, the Voc was continuously increased to 610 mV. Meanwhile, the dark current onset potential also shifted from 365 mV for MS-M to 395 mV for MS-F and 420 mV for MS-C, suggesting that the charge recombination might be retarded step by step. However, besides the charge recombination rate (often referred to as the electron lifetime), the Voc is also strongly dependent on the CB edge position of TiO2.8 Therefore, to get insight into the relationship between chemical structure and photovoltage, the Voc and electron lifetime as a function of electron density were measured by stepped light-induced transient measurements.9 Light intensity was adjusted by changing the bias voltage of the light source. The electron density was indirectly adjusted by verifying the intensity of bias light impinging on the cell.
While illuminated with same intensity, the electron densities lay in the order MS-C > MS-F > MS-M, consistent with their corresponding Jsc values (Fig. 7a). It also can be found that for all DSSCs, the Voc increases linearly with the logarithm of electron density. Two curves of DSSCs based on MS-C and MS-M have a similar slope and coincide with each other. At a fixed electron density, these two DSSCs give almost the same Voc values, which indicates that they have identical CB positions. In the case of MS-F, a slightly lower Voc value was observed at a fixed electron density, suggesting that the CB position of TiO2 sensitized by MS-F is a little more positive than the other two dyes. Comprehensively, the CB edge was not affected so much when the branched system was constructed. So, the differences of Voc should be attributed to the charge recombination rate.
 Fig. 7  (a) Open-circuit voltage (Voc) and (b) electron lifetime as a function of electron density based on MS-C, MS-F, and MS-M-sensitized solar cells. 
As shown in Fig. 7b, the electron lifetime decreases with electron density with the same slope, suggesting the same recombination mechanism.10 At a fixed electron density, the electron lifetimes for DSSCs based on MS-C and MS-F are much longer than that of MS-M. For an electron density of 1.6 × 1018 cm−3, the lifetime of branched MS-F was determined to be 79 ms, which is nearly 4 times as long as that of MS-M (21 ms). Moreover, by introducing a carbazole group (MS-C), the lifetime is further enhanced to a higher grade (265 ms). This means that the branched 2D-π-A system with high electron-donating ability is much more efficient for suppressing the electron recombination than the linear system. Therefore, a net Voc increase of 102 mV is realized by branched MS-C, as an overall result of CB shift and electron recombination prevention, compared to linear MS-M.
Accordingly, based on the improvement of the Jsc and Voc, branched MS-C shows a η of 5.53%, which is more than two times higher than linear MS-M (2.74%).
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized three novel coumarin dyes based on a branched 2D-π-A system (MS-C and MS-F) and linear D-π-A system (MS-M). The photo-response areas of three dyes were tuned efficiently. The IPCE action spectrum of MS-C keeps an extraordinarily high plateau in visible region from 390 nm to 580 nm with nearly unity values. Along with the improvement of IPCE, the Jsc of three dyes were increased by 77% from 7.61 (MS-M) to 13.47 mA cm−2 (MS-C). By comparing the Jsc values with and without addition of DCA, the branched 2D-π-A construction was proved to be more effective to prevent the π-aggregation than the linear one. More important, the Voc was also improved significantly by introducing the additional donor. Compared to the linear MS-M, the Voc of branched MS-C was sharply increased by 102 mV from 508 mV to 610 mV. Comprehensively, a more than 100% improvement in overall conversion efficiency (5.53%) was realized by branched MS-C compared to the reference linear MS-M (2.74%). Briefly, the branched double-donor approach carries a number of advantages: (a) higher electron-donating ability to broaden the photoresponse area; (b) enhancement of current density due to higher light-harvesting capability; (c) prevention of π-aggregation by its own construction; (d) efficiently enhancing Voc by simple structure modification. Although the overall conversion efficiencies of these dyes are not very high, these results will still afford significant value for future development of efficient coumarin sensitizers with high open-circuit voltage.

Fabrication and measurement of solar cells. 
12 μm nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes with 4 μm scattering layer were prepared and modified following the reported procedure.13 The thickness of TiO2 film was measured by a surface profiler (Dektak Co., Ltd, Model DAKTAK II). The dye-loaded electrodes were prepared by dipping TiO2 electrodes (1.2 cm × 0.8 cm) into 0.3 mM dye solution (CHCl3/C2H5OH = 3/2) with 0 or 5 mM DCA for 6 h. To prepare the counter electrode, the Pt catalyst was deposited on the cleaned FTO glass by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (0.02 M in 2-propanol solution) with the heat treatment at 500 °C for 30 min. In this work, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidiazolium iodide (BMII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.6 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile was used as the redox electrolyte.
Photovoltaic measurements employed an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp (OTENTO-SUN II, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a reference silicon cell (BS-520, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd). I–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The voltage step and delay time of photocurrent were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively. Cell active area was controlled to be 0.142 cm2 by a metal mask. The photocurrent action spectra were measured with a monochromator (M10-T, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd). The intensity of monochromic light was calibrated by a reference silicon cell (S1337-1010BQ, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd). Each value in this work is an average of three samples.


Measurement of electron lifetime and electron density. 
Electron lifetime and electron density in the complete dye-sensitized solar cell devices were measured by the stepped light-induced transient measurements of the photocurrent and voltage using a DSSCs evaluation system PSL-100 (EKO Co. Ltd).9 A laser (λ = 640 nm) was used as a light source. The transients were induced by a stepwise change in the laser intensity which was controlled by adjusting its voltage. The photocurrent and photovoltage transients were monitored using a digital oscilloscope through an amplifier. Through varying the laser intensity, the lifetime could be estimated over a range of open-circuit voltages by fitting a decay of the photovoltage transient with exp(−t/τ).9 The electron density measurement was performed using the following method: the DSSCs was illuminated for 5 s while a bias voltage was applied to make the cell open-circuited, then the laser was shut down, while simultaneously, the cell was switched from an open to a short circuit. The resulting current was measured at 25 s and then the electron density could be calculated through integrating the quantity of electric charge. All experiments were conducted at room temperature.
