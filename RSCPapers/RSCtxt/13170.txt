    , Accepted 7th October 2022First published on 11th October 2022AbstractIncorporating solvent additives in donor and acceptor solutions is an effective strategy for achieving efficient organic solar cells. As the state-of-the-art photovoltaic materials have thiophene sequences along their conjugated backbones, in this contribution, thiophene analogues 2,5-dibromothiophene (HBrT) and 2,5-dibromo-3,4-difluoro-thiophene (FBrT) have been developed as solvent additives. Results show that FBrT has a high boiling point and the ability to dissolve donors and acceptors readily due to the “like dissolve like” principle, providing an effective tool in prolonging the crystallization and phase separation kinetic process of photovoltaic materials. Due to the concurrent formation of increased crystallinity, favorable phase separation, and P–i–N-like heterojunction, the FBrT-treated solar cells demonstrated improved exciton dissociation, charge transportation, extraction, and suppressed carrier recombination. Therefore, the PM6:Y6-based solar cells with FBrT additive reached an efficiency of 17.9% and fill factor of 78.6%, which are one of the highest values reached for the PM6:Y6-based binary solar cells. More strikingly, the FBrT solvent additive possesses general applicability in L8-BO, Y6-BO, and BTP-eC9-based solar cells and achieves significantly enhanced efficiencies of 18.6∼18.7% in devices. These findings make it clear that the thiophene derivatives are effective solvent additives for the further optimization of organic solar cells.

Broader context
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have gained considerable attention from academia and industry due to their advantages such as low-cost fabrication into flexible, lightweight, and semitransparent devices. Incorporating solvent additive into host solvent is recognized as an effective strategy in reaching optimal nanoscale morphology and enhancing efficiency. Whereas, how to design effective solvent additives is still to be defined. It should be emphasized that (i) the organic photovoltaic materials have thiophene building blocks along their backbones, (ii) “like dissolve like” is the basic principle for choosing good solvents for chemicals. To this end, we designed two thiophene derivatives 2,5-dibromothiophene (HBrT) and 2,5-dibromo-3,4-difluoro-thiophene (FBrT), which can finely dissolve the photovoltaic materials, providing meaningful strategy in prolonging crystallization and phase separation kinetic process. As result, the PM6:Y6 based OSCs with FBrT additive reached a significantly improved efficiency of nearing 18.0% and promising fill factor of 78.6%. More strikingly, FBrT additive possesses general applicability in L8-BO, Y6-BO, and BTP-eC9 based OSCs and achieves significantly enhanced efficiencies of 18.6–18.7% in devices. Moreover, how the structural modification (fluorination and bromination) of thiophene derivatives impact the nanoscale morphology was systematic studied. These findings highlight the significant effect of thiophene derivatives in the morphology control.

1. Introduction
The bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) relying on polymer donors and small-molecule acceptors are gaining considerable attention, mainly because of their unique characteristics such as low-cost device fabrication via the high-throughput printing technology, flexibility, and light weight.1–4 In recent years, thanks to the rapid advancement of non-fullerene acceptors featuring narrow bandgaps, strong light absorption in the near-infrared region (NIR), readily tunable energy levels, and fast electron transportation, OSCs have reached a big breakthrough with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) nearing 20%5–10 and extrapolated lifetime of over 20 years.11 Besides the rational design of efficient organic photovoltaic materials, the systematic nanoscale morphology optimization of BHJ photoactive layers is also of critical importance for fabricating high-performance OSCs because light absorption and photoexcitation, exciton diffusion and dissociation, charge transportation, and collection are highly determined by the nanoscale morphology of the BHJ photoactive layers.12–14 More often than not, reaching advantageous nanoscale morphology in BHJ solar cells desires examination and scanning several of these solution processing parameters: solvents,15–17 solvent or solid additives,18–20 thermal or solvent vapor annealing,21 inserting an interlayer of bottom electrode,22etc.
Of all the optimization strategies known to mediate the BHJ nanoscale morphology, incorporating traces of solvent additives into host solvents has been recognized as an especially uncomplicated and effective tool in reaching optimal morphology.23 A broader consensus emphasized that the solvent additives demonstrate a wide range of possible effects, spanning (i) enhancing the crystallinity of photovoltaic materials, leading to higher charge mobilities and red-shifted light absorption,24 (ii) improving the domain purity, resulting in negligible charge recombination,25 (iii) tailoring the domain size and phase separation, producing efficient exciton dissociation,26 and (iv) regulating the diffusion of donor or acceptor molecules in the vertical direction, yielding a favorable active layer with P–i–N heterojunction.27 In these instances, the BHJ active layers are cast from the solution with the aid of the solvent additive and at least one of the donors and acceptors tend to stay in the solution (during the film solidification) longer than that cast from the solution without the solvent additive. A longer evaporation process of the solvent additive can prolong the crystallization kinetic process and enrich the crystallinity of the photovoltaic materials, thus enabling the regulation of the BHJ nanoscale morphology.28
Solvent additives that effectively regulate the BHJ nanoscale morphology should possess specific characteristics, including (i) generally higher boiling point than that of the host solvents, (ii) good or modest solvents that dissolve at least one of the donor and acceptor.29 Since the pioneering work of using solvent additives, numerous solvent additives have been used to regulate the BHJ nanoscale morphology and reach efficient OSCs. Most of the solvent additives can be divided into the following several classes: (i) halogenated alkane derivatives (e.g. 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO),30 diiodomethane (DIM),31etc.), (ii) benzene derivatives (e.g. 1, 3-dibromo-5-chlorobenzene (DBCl),32 1,4-diiodobenzene (DIB),33 2,6-dichloroiodobenzene (DCIB),34etc.), (iii) naphthalene derivatives (e.g. 1-chloronaphthalene (CN),35 1-fluoronaphthalene (FN),36 1-methylnaphthalene, etc.), and (iv) amide derivatives (e.g. dimethylacetamide (DMA),37N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP),38etc.). While other classes of solvent additives that can be used to reach efficient OSCs are rarely reported.
When we take a careful look at the chemical structures of the organic and polymeric photovoltaic materials, all of the high-performance photovoltaic materials include one or more thiophene blocks along their conjugated backbones.39–41 Previous reports concluded that thiophene is an effective electron-donating or π-bridge building block. It is widely recognized and proved that the thiophene rings in the conjugated backbones possess strong π–π stacking and donor–acceptor (D–A) intermolecular interactions with the thiophene-based organic and polymeric photovoltaic materials.42 Intrinsically, dissolve behavior is that the solvent molecules interact with the solute molecules and then disperse the solute as molecule states. As the basic principle “like dissolves like” stated, the stronger the intermolecular interactions between the solute molecule and solvent molecule, the greater the solubility of the solute in the solvent.43 Rationally, thiophene, when substituted with proper heteroatoms or functional groups, may serve as a good solvent or solvent additive for tailoring the nanoscale morphology of BHJ photoactive layers. Whereas, to the best of our knowledge, thiophene derivatives have not been used as solvent or additive in fabricating OSCs mainly due to (i) the low boiling point (84 °C) of thiophene, (ii) low solubility of polymeric materials in the pristine thiophene. Therefore, it is interesting and essential to (i) design thiophene derivatives with good solubility for organic photovoltaic materials and high boiling point, (ii) examine how these novel additives regulate the nanoscale morphology of BHJ photoactive layers, and (iii) thereby further boost the photovoltaic performance.
In this concise contribution, we report on the design approach, basic properties, and photovoltaic performance in OSCs of a set of two analogous halogenated thiophene-based solvent additives—with a specific look at how these two solvent additives can impact the nanoscale morphology and thus the electronic and optical properties of the corresponding OSCs. It was found that the two additives 2,5-dibromothiophene (HBrT) and 2,5-dibromo-3,4-difluoro-thiophene (FBrT), with chemical structures provided in Fig. 1, outperform the benchmark and widely studied additive 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) in regulating the nanoscale morphology and reaching efficient OSCs. Comparing the three thiophene derivatives 4HT, HBrT, and FBrT, the introduction of the bromine atoms and fluorine atoms in thiophene motif not only can increase the boiling point but also can elevate the intermolecular interactions (non-covalent interaction) with PM6 and Y6, yielding higher solubility of PM6 and Y6 in the FBrT solvent than in HBrT and CN solvents. Compared with the benchmark solvent additive CN, incorporating FBrT as an additive in the host solvent produced favorable PM6, Y6, and their BHJ blend films featuring red-shifted and coefficient-increased light absorption spectra, enhanced crystallinity, and a P–i–N-like heterojunction. In the PM6:Y6-based BHJ devices, we find that the concurrent increase in the hole and electron mobility from 1.34 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.72 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for CN-based devices to 3.49 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.30 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for FBrT-based devices, respectively. The increased charge mobilities contribute to the significantly improved fill factor (FF) of 78.6% and PCE of 17.9% for the FBrT-based solar devices, compared with the FF of 74.8% and PCE of 16.5% for the CN-based control devices. As shown in Fig. 2, most of the prior reported PM6:Y6-based binary BHJ solar cells only reached an FF of less than 78% and PCE of less than 17%. To the best of our knowledge, the FF values of 78.6% and a PCE of 17.9% for PM6:Y6 achieved in this work represent one of the highest FFs and PCEs obtained in PM6:Y6 binary BHJ solar cells. More strikingly, this new designed halogenated thiophene FBrT can be also used as an additive in regulating the morphology of other Y6 derivative-based high-performance BHJ systems, including PM6:L8-BO, PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:Y6-BO, leading to a promising PCE of 18.6–18.7% with a remarkable FF of 79–80%. Our systematic examination of the morphological and charge effects through the combination of UV-vis absorption, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), confocal laser scanning confocal Raman microscope, space-charge-limited current (SCLC), and light intensity dependent J–V curves highlight that the halogenated thiophene derivative is particularly efficient in tailoring optimal morphology and reaching high-performance OSCs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Design, synthesis, and properties of the solvent additive
Most of the solvent additives used in regulating the BHJ nanoscale morphology and fabricating efficient OSCs were obtained from commercial sources. A broader consensus emphasizes that the solvent additives, with high boiling points (Bp.) and the ability to dissolve the donor or acceptor, are prone to prolonging the crystallization and phase separation kinetic processes of organic photovoltaic materials. Whereas, how to design effective solvent additives is yet to be defined. “Like dissolve like” is the basic principle for choosing solvents and solvent additives for dissolving organic and polymeric materials. The state-of-the-art donor and acceptor photovoltaic materials, such as the conjugated homopolymers (e.g. P3HT,44etc.), donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating conjugated copolymers (e.g. PTB7, PM6, etc.),42,45 and non-fullerene acceptors (e.g. ITIC, Y6, and their derivatives)46–48 have several thiophene building blocks along their backbones. Thiophene, when modified with proper substituents may serve as a good solvent or solvent additive for those efficient photovoltaic materials due to the strong (i) π–π and (ii) S⋯S intermolecular interactions between thiophene-based solvents and thiophene-included photovoltaic materials. As shown in Fig. 3, thiophene (4HT, Bp. 84.2 °C) was first substituted with two bromine atoms, leading to 2,5-dibromothiophene (HBrT) with a significantly increased boiling point of 209.5 °C. Considering that the efficient donors and acceptors are fluorinated organic and polymeric materials, and thus, the HBrT was further substituted with two fluorine atoms, yielding a new solvent 2,5-dibromo-3,4-difluoro-thiophene (FBrT, Bp. 237.7 °C). FBrT was prepared according to our previously reported procedures.49–511H NMR, 13C NMR, and 19F NMR of FBrT data are provided in the ESI.†

The solubility of the photovoltaic materials in thiophene derivatives was evaluated simply by adding 1 mg PM6 or Y6 in 0.2 mL solvents and then stirring overnight. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the three thiophene derivatives can totally dissolve the small molecule acceptor Y6. While the polymer donor PM6 demonstrated largely different solubility in the three thiophene derivatives. As illustrated in Fig. 3b and c, there are visible insoluble particles in 4HT and HBrT solutions, suggesting that the solubility of PM6 in 4HT and HBrT was less than 5.0 mg mL−1. As provided in Fig. 3d, the solution of PM6 in FBrT became clear in a short time, pointing to the higher solubility of PM6 in FBrT as a result of the strong π–π, S⋯S, in tandem with the F⋯H intermolecular interactions between PM6 and FBrT. For comparison, the solubility of PM6 in the benchmark solvent additive 1-chloronaphthalene (CN, Bp. 259.3 °C) was also tested. The more visible insoluble particles in Fig. 3a indicate that CN is not a good solvent for PM6. To obtain the exact solubility of PM6 in solvent additive, more solvent additives were added to the above solution and totally dissolve the PM6. As provided in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the solubility of PM6 is ca. 1.0 mg mL−1 in CN, 0.5 mg mL−1 in 4HT, 2.0 mg mL−1 in HBrT, 15.0 mg mL−1 in FBrT.
Due to the (i) higher boiling point of FBrT and (ii) higher solubility of PM6 and Y6 in FBrT, the FBrT can prolong the crystallization and phase separation kinetic process when casting PM6 and Y6 from their FBrT-contained solutions. FBrT may serve as an effective alternative to the benchmark solvent additive CN. To understand how the solvent additives HBrT and FBrT impact the light absorption of photovoltaic materials, PM6, Y6 neat films, and their blend films were cast from their chloroform solutions without or with different solvent additives (0.5 vol%). As illustrated in Fig. 4, the absorption spectra of PM6, Y6, and PM6:Y6 films are largely dependent on the solvent additives. As for the PM6 neat film, the absorption coefficients at the absorption peak of 574 nm increased from 5.9 × 10−4 cm−1 for CN to 6.3 × 10−4 cm−1 for HBrT, and further increased to 7.0 × 10−4 cm−1 for FBrT, representing the formation of ordered PM6 aggregates with the aid of FBrT. As shown in Fig. 4b and Fig. S5 (ESI†), the Y6 neat film processed with the FBrT additive demonstrated ≈ a 20 nm red-shifted absorption spectrum along with an increased absorption coefficient when compared with that of the Y6 neat film processed with CN additive, indicating the formation of more ordered aggregation states in thin films. Turning to the PM6:Y6 BHJ blend films, a similar effect of the FBrT additive on the absorption spectra were also found in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Collectively, the red-shifted and coefficient-increased absorption spectra of PM6, Y6, and their BHJ blend films can be readily reached by adding the FBrT additive in the host solvent, to some extent, pointing to the formation of enhanced crystallinity in the films.

2.2. Photovoltaic properties of BHJ solar cells
The newly designed HBrT and FBrT additives can finely regulate the assembly and absorption spectra of the photovoltaic materials PM6 and Y6. Herein, the BHJ solar cells with the device architecture of ITO/2PACz/PM6:Y6/PDINN/Ag were fabricated and examined to validate the superiority of HBrT and FBrT on the photovoltaic performance. The PM6:Y6 BHJ active layers were spin-coated from chloroform solutions with different solvent additives, the chemical structures of 2PACz and PDINN, and the detailed device fabrication and optimization procedures are provided in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1, the three additives yielded largely distinct photovoltaic performance. The control PM6:Y6 solar cells processed with the benchmark additive CN demonstrated a maximum PCE of 16.5%, with a VOC of 0.85 V, a JSC of 25.93 mA cm−2, and an FF of 74.8%, which are comparable to the previously reported performance.52 Turning to HBrT and FBrT additives, the solar cells presented significantly improved performance. As for the devices subjected to HBrT, the device FF and JSC increased to 75.9% and 26.37 mA cm−2, yielding a high PCE of 17.0%. In comparison, the devices with FBrT showed an even higher PCE of 17.9%, with simultaneously enhanced FF of 78.6% and JSC of 26.78 mA cm−2, while maintaining almost the same high VOC of 0.85 V as that of the CN- and HBrT-based devices. To the best of our knowledge, 17.9% and 78.6% are one of the highest efficiency and FF values, respectively, that reached in PM6:Y6-based BHJ binary solar cells so far (see Fig. 2c). The statistical histograms of the efficiency of 30 × 3 BHJ solar devices shown in Fig. 5c also emphasize the superiority of FBrT additives over other additives. In more detail, the FF values increased from 74.8% for CN-based cells to 75.9% for HBrT-based cells and further increased to 78.6% for the FBrT-based cells, suggesting the formation of beneficial BHJ nanoscale morphologies with the aid of HBrT and FBrT additives (later discussed in the Morphology Section).

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the CN-, HBrT-, and FBrT-based BHJ solar devices shown in Fig. 5b further confirm the trend observed from the J–V curves in Fig. 5a. The JSC values determined by integrating the EQE curves are quite consistent (±1 mA cm−2, ±4%) with the JSC values provided in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 5b, all the BHJ solar cells demonstrated a broad and efficient photon-to-current conversion in the range of 300–950 nm as a result of the good spectral complementarity between the PM6 donor and Y6 acceptor. Compared with CN-based devices, the two thiophene derivatives HBrT- and FBrT-based devices not only possessed ca. 20 nm red-shifted EQE spectra but also demonstrated greater spectral response in a broad range 550–950 nm. For the FBrT-based solar cells, the EQE maxima reached 86% at 605 nm and 83% at 805 nm, which belonged to the absorption peaks of PM6 and Y6, respectively. While for the CN-based control BHJ solar cells, the EQE maxima showed only lower values of 82% at 605 nm and 78% at 805 nm. The broader and enhanced photon-to-current conversion in FBrT-based devices agree well with the FBT-based neat and blend films’ absorption spectra characterized by the red-shift and increased absorption coefficient.
2.3. Charge generation, transportation, extraction and recombination
Besides the favorable light absorption and EQE photo response, the charge carrier dynamics are another critical factor in the improved FF and JSC. The red-shifted absorption spectra and EQE spectra indicated that FBrT and HBrT solvent additives can enhance the crystallinity of the PM6:Y6 BHJ blend films. Reasonably, the enhanced crystallinity can diminish the energetic disorder and benefit charge transportation across the active layers. Firstly, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities were examined via the established space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method53 to understand the impact of solvent additives on the charge transport in BHJ devices. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, Fig. S16 (ESI†), and Table 2, the μh and μe of the control CN-based BHJ devices reached only modest values of ≈1.34 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ≈0.72 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Thus, the CN-based devices were found to have a large μh/μe ratio of 1.86, pointing to the imbalance of hole and electron transportation in the devices. While the HBrT- and FBrT-based devices demonstrated larger μh and μe values, simultaneously, in tandem with the decreased μh/μe ratios. Especially, the μh and μe values for the FBrT-based devices reached ≈3.49 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ≈3.30 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are 2.6 and 4.6 times higher than those of the control CN-based BHJ devices. Moreover, the μh/μe ratios decrease from 1.86 for CN-based devices to 1.06 for FBrT-based devices, which coincides well with the largest FF value of nearing 79% and JSC value of 26.78 mA cm−2 for FBrT-based BHJ solar cells.

Secondly, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective bias (Veff) characteristics were examined to investigate the charge generation and extraction (see details in the ESI†). As shown in Fig. 6b, the Jph for the control CN-based devices increased rapidly at low biases of less than 0.10 V but slowly at biases in the range of 0.10–0.30 V, and then saturated at higher biases of over 0.32 V. Whereas, the Jph for the FBrT-based devices increased rapidly and saturated at low biases of ≈0.17 V and then presented less pronounced field-dependent behavior beyond 0.17 V, suggesting the extraction of the photogenerated charges in the devices is more efficient and charge recombination is suppressed, which are consistent well with the high FF values in the corresponding solar cells. Moreover, inferring from the Jph–Veff curves in Fig. 6b, the exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) and charge collection probability (Pcoll) could be obtained. As summarized in Table 2, the exciton dissociation probability Pdiss values, which are defined by normalizing JSC with Jsat, were estimated to be ≈99.0%, 98.8%, and 97.6% for FBrT-, HBrT-, and CN-based solar cells, respectively. The charge collection probability Pcoll, determined by the ratio of Jph/Jsat, was calculated to be 90.0%, 88.0%, and 87.7% for FBrT-, HBrT-, and CN-based solar cells, respectively. The trends of the Pdiss and Pcoll are similar to the trends of JSC and FF that were observed in the studies of photovoltaic performance. The highest Pdiss and Pcoll values for FBrT-based devices also emphasized the efficient exciton dissociation, charge generation, and charge extraction in solar devices, which are in good agreement with the highest JSC values reached in corresponding devices.
Thirdly, bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination is one of the detrimental factors for the FF parameter. To explore the charge recombination loss, the J–V curves under various light intensities (Plight) were measured, and the JSC and VOCversus light intensity (Plight) curves are provided in Fig. 7. Fitting the JSC–Plight curves of the three devices yields slope (α) values of 0.98–0.99, which are close to unity, indicating that (i) the photo-generated charges can be efficiently swept out and extracted at the corresponding electrodes prior to recombination, (ii) the bimolecular recombination losses under short circuit conditions are negligible for those devices processed with CN, HBrT, and FBrT solvent additives. Fitting the VOC–Plight curves through the equation  in which n, q, T, and k represent the indicator of trap-assisted recombination, elementary charge, the temperature in Kelvin, and Boltzmann constant yielded n values of 1.06, 1.10, and 1.25 for FBrT-, HBrT-, and CN-based solar devices, respectively. Usually, if n = 1, it is the trap-free condition; if the n value deviates from 1, it points to the presence of trap-assisted recombination. As indicated by the n values, the CN-based devices featuring larger n values of 1.25 suffer from serious trap-assisted recombination. The FBrT- and HBrT-based devices possessed n values of ≈1.1, which are close to unity, suggesting the trap-assisted recombination is significantly suppressed in devices. The negligible and suppressed recombination in FBrT-based devices reasonably contributes to a larger FF in devices.

2.4. The morphology of the BHJ active layers
The red-shifted and photoresponse-increased absorption and EQE spectra, increased and balanced carrier transportation, and suppressed charge recombination in FBrT-based systems suggest that PM6, Y6, and their BHJ blend films may have enhanced crystallinity with the aid of FBrT additive. Herein, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analyses were performed to verify this speculation. As reported in previous results,54 it has been proved that different GIWAXS scattering patterns of PM6:Y6 films with and without CN were reached. As provided in Tables S7, S8 and Fig. S14, S15 (ESI†), Fig. 8, the three solvent additives FBrT, HBrT, and CN have a profound effect on the GIWAXS scattering patterns. In detail, all of the PM6 neat films demonstrated in-plane (IP) lamellar (100) diffraction at 0.29–0.30 Å−1 and out-of-plane (OOP) π–π stacking (010) diffraction at ≈1.73 Å−1, which are corresponding to the π–π stacking distance of 3.65, 3.64 and 3.60 nm, respectively. However, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and crystal coherence length (CCL) are largely dependent on the solvent additives. As shown in Fig. S14 and Table S7 (ESI†), diffraction characterized by the sharper peak, higher intensity, and narrower FWHM of 0.20 Å−1 were observed in FBrT-based PM6 neat film. Inferred from the narrower FWHM, the FBrT-based PM6 neat film presented larger CCL values of 27.64 Å via the equation of CCL = 2πK/FWHM,55 in which K equals 0.9. The control PM6 film processed with the benchmark additive CN possessed a slightly larger FWHM of 0.23 Å−1 and a smaller CCL of 25.08 Å. Similar trends were also observed in the neat Y6 films (see Fig. S15 and Table S8, ESI†). Turning to examine the BHJ blend films (Fig. 8 and Table 3), the diffraction peaks of PM6 and Y6 neat films were inherited from the BHJ blend films. As indicated by the strong (100) lamellar peak at ≈0.29 Å−1 in the IP direction and obvious (010) π–π peak at ≈1.76 Å−1 in the OOP direction (Fig. 8d), the three BHJ blend films adopted good crystallinity and predominantly face-on orientation. Compared with that in the control CN-processed BHJ blend film, the (010) π–π stacking peak in the OOP direction is slightly sharper in the FBrT- and HBrT-processed BHJ blend films. Consequently, the FBrT- and HBrT-based PM6:Y6 BHJ films demonstrated a narrower FWHM of 0.21 Å−1 and 0.22 Å−1, respectively. Deriving from the FWHM, the largest CCL of 27.50 Å was reached for the FBrT-based blend film. In contrast, the control CN-based blend film possessed the smallest CCL value of 25.06 Å. Overall, the increased CCL values achieved in FBrT-based neat and BHJ blend films suggest that the π–π stacking, crystal size, and crystallinity of PM6, Y6 neat, and BHJ blend films were improved, in good agreement with the aforementioned red-shifted absorption and EQE spectra, and the increased charge mobility.

As stated in prior reports, solvent additives with a high boiling point can facilitate the nucleation for crystallization and crystal growth by decreasing the nucleation barrier for crystallization and reducing the evaporation process. In this case study, the host solvent chloroform with a low boiling point of ≈61.2 °C evaporates quickly, Therefore, the three solvent additives with high boiling points (Bp) of 210–260 °C can definitely prolong the evaporation process. In detail, the polymer donor PM6 shows large different solubility in FBrT, HBrT, and CN additives, with solubility trend of FBrT > HBrT > CN (see Fig. 3). When we carefully inspect the chemical structures of PM6, Y6 derivatives, and FBrT, (i) there are eight and four thiophene rings in the repeat unit of PM6 and Y6 molecules; (ii) all of the PM6, Y6, and FBrT are fluorinated organic materials. Based on the basic principle of “like dissolve like”, the FBrT can easily dissolve the PM6 and Y6 derivatives due to the strong π–π stacking, S⋯S, F⋯H intermolecular interactions between FBrT additive and photovoltaic materials. Consequently, the slow evaporation process and good solubility of the FBrT additive contribute to the effective nucleation for crystallization and crystal growth. Moreover, due to the strong intermolecular interactions, especially the π–π stacking between FBrT and PM6, Y6, the additive FBrT molecules could self-assembly and form an ordered solvation layer at the surround of the PM6 and Y6 molecules or aggregates in semi-solid films (see Fig. 9). Reasonably, the ordered solvation layer should be tighter and thinner, and thus reduce the distance between molecules or aggregates in semi-solid films. Consequently, the tight π–π stacking and enhanced crystallinity of PM6 and Y6 can be formed after the long-time evaporation of the ordered solvation layer. The proposed and possible mechanism for the FBrT additive enhances the crystallinity of the PM6 and Y6 BHJ blend films is illustrated in Fig. 9.

(i) The schematic diagram of PM6:Y6 blend morphology without solvent additive; (ii) the schematic diagram of PM6:Y6 blend morphology with FBrT solvent additive; (iii) the schematic diagram of PM6:Y6 blend morphology after FBrT solvent additive volatilization. 
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to further verify the favorable morphology induced by the aid of FBrT and HBrT additives. As proved by Fig. S11 (ESI†), all three BHJ blend films demonstrated similar and rather smooth top surfaces with small root-mean-square roughness (RMS) values of 1.13–1.31 nm. Turning to the phase images (see Fig. 10a–c), largely distinct morphology was observed in those BHJ films. As shown in Fig. 10a and b, obviously fibril-like morphology with continuous interpenetrating net frameworks was formed in the PM6:Y6 BHJ films with FBrT and HBrT additive. The fibril-like morphology is indicative of the ordered structure and quite consistent with the increased crystallinity confirmed from the 2D GIWAXS examination. While for the control BHJ film with the CN additive, unremarkable fibril-like morphology was achieved, as shown in Fig. 10c.

The scan area and step size of Raman mapping are 5 μm × 5 μm and 0.1 μm, respectively. The blue and red color regions represent the PM6 and Y6 domains in the BHJ blend films, respectively. 
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a useful method to probe the phase separation, but the TEM images provided in Fig. S12 (ESI†) could not figure out the donor domains and the acceptor domains as (i) the PM6 and Y6 are composed of light atoms such as C, H, N, O, S, and thus (ii) have low contrast when interacting with the beam of electrons of TEM. Because the acceptor Y6 and donor PM6 have largely distinct characteristic Raman peaks at 2220 cm−1 and 2977 cm−1 (see Fig. S13, ESI†), respectively. Herein, a confocal laser scanning confocal Raman microscope was used to figure out the acceptor domains, and donor domains, thus examining the phase separation of the top surface of BHJ films by detecting these two characteristic signals (see experimental details in the ESI†). The red and blue color regions represent the acceptor Y6 domains and donor PM6 domains in the BHJ films shown in Fig. 10d–f, respectively. As provided in Fig. 10f, the control PM6:Y6 BHJ film with CN additive is featured with larger donor domains, as indicated by the larger area of blue color regions and considerable phase separation, which are detrimental to exciton dissociation and charge transfer between the donor and acceptor domains. Moreover, the top surface of this BHJ film is rich in blue color regions, and the area ratio of red regions to blue regions is ca. 34.8:65.2, as shown in Fig. 10f, suggesting that the donor PM6 is enriched at the top surface that interacts with the cathode. Generally, the donor PM6 domains enriched at the top surface of the active layer, to some extent, hinder the electron transportation and extraction at the cathode, thus, in this work, a lower FF of 74.6% in devices was achieved. Turning to the BHJ layers with FBrT or HBrT (Fig. 10d and e), the donor PM6 domains, indicated by the blue area, became smaller, while the acceptor Y6 domains indicated by the red area became larger. The area ratio of red regions to blue regions is 61.0:39.0 and 47.9:52.1 for the FBrT- and HBrT-based BHJ blend films, respectively, as shown in Fig. 10d and e. Fig. 10d and e reveals that FBrT- and HBrT-based BHJ active layers are characterized by the accumulation of the acceptor Y6 domains at the BHJ film-cathode interface, to some extent, and the formation of the P–i–N-like heterojunction. The P–i–N-like heterojunction in FBrT-based solar cells is beneficial for electron transportation and extraction at the cathode, yielding a higher FF of 78.6% in FBrT-based solar cells.
2.5. General applicability of solvent additives
Known from the above systemic examinations, the halogenated thiophene FBrT is definitely an effective solvent additive in mediating and producing favorable nanoscale morphology of BHJ photoactive layers. The FBrT additive can simultaneously increase the light absorption coefficient and photon-to-current conversion, extend the absorption and EQE spectra, enhance the crystallinity, and smooth the surface of the neat and BHJ films. To verify this general applicability of FBrT additives, other various and more efficient Y6 derivatives, such as L8-BO, Y6-BO, and BTP-eC9 were also used as acceptors and PM6 was used as the benchmark donor to fabricate efficient solar cells. The chemical structures of the Y6 derivatives, J–V curves, EQE spectra, and the key photovoltaic parameters are provided in Fig. 11 and Table 4. Moreover, the J–V curves, EQE spectra, and the key photovoltaic performance parameters of the control BHJ devices without and with the benchmark solvent additives CN and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) are provided in Fig. S17–S19 and Tables S11–S13 (ESI†). As expected, the devices based on these three BHJ systems were found to manifest simultaneously enhanced JSC and FF, while they did not demonstrate any missing VOC. Looking into the state-of-the-art PM6:L8-BO BHJ system, the champion device reached a brilliant FF of 80.1% and slightly increased JSC of 25.89 mA cm−2, and thus achieved a promising PCE of 18.7%. The FF and PCE achieved in PM6:L8-BO devices processed with FBrT additive is much higher than that of the control devices without any solvent additive (PCE = 15.8%, FF = 75.3%) or with the benchmark solvent additives CN (PCE = 18.2%, FF = 78.4%) and DIO (PCE = 17.7%, FF = 77.8%). The other two BHJ systems PM6:Y6-BO and PM6:BTP-eC9 also presented similar improved FF, JSC, and thus achieved significantly enhanced PCEs of 18.6% and 18.7%, respectively. The PCE of 18.6–18.7% reached in these FBrT-based BHJ solar cells, to the best of our knowledge, is one of the highest efficiency achieved for binary single junction organic solar cells to date. Overall, the superior photovoltaic performance with outstanding FFs and PCEs achieved in the FBrT processed solar devices emphasizes the significant potential of the halogenated thiophene solvent additive in tailoring the light absorption, molecular self-assembly, and charge transportation, thus reaching efficient organic solar cells.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we showed that the newly designed 3,4-difluoro-thiophene (FBrT) with a high boiling point of 237.7 °C can finely dissolve the photovoltaic materials donor polymer PM6 and acceptor Y6 derivatives due to the “like dissolve like” basic principle, providing meaningful roles in tailoring the nanoscale morphology of the BHJ photoactive layers. The PM6:Y6 BHJ organic solar cells processed with the FBrT solvent additive reached significantly improved efficiency of nearing 18.0% and promising FF of 78.6%, which are one of the highest values for the PM6:Y6 based binary solar cells to date. While the control BHJ solar cells processed with benchmark solvent additive 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) reached only modest efficiency of 16.5% and FF of 74.8%. The combination of grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and confocal laser scanning confocal Raman microscope showed that the FBrT solvent additive not only can increase the crystallinity of photoactive layers but also can produce a P–i–N-like heterojunction by prolonging the crystallization and phase separation kinetic process of the organic photovoltaic materials. Benefiting from the favorable BHJ nanoscale morphology obtained in FBrT solar cells, the μh and μe were found to show a significant increase from 1.34 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.72 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the CN-based control devices to 3.49 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.30 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the FBrT-based devices, respectively. The significantly increased and more balanced charge mobilities suppressed charge recombination, and improved charge extraction at electrodes translated into promising FF of 78.6% and JSC of 26.78 mA cm−2, largely higher than that of the control BHJ devices with the benchmark solvent additive CN (FF 74.8%, JSC 25.93 mA cm−2). Moreover, similar efficiencies and FF enhancements were also achieved in various BHJ systems, e.g., the PM6:L8-BO, PM6:Y6-BO, PM6:BTP-eC9-based organic solar cells processed with FBrT solvent additive demonstrated significantly improved PCEs of 18.6–18.7% and FFs of 78.9–80.1%. Considering that (i) the state-of-the-art organic photovoltaic materials have thiophene oligomers or sequences along their conjugated backbones, (ii) the superior BHJ nanoscale morphology and photovoltaic performance achieved in the FBrT-based organic solar cells, the thiophene derivatives with proper substituents are the potential effective solvent additive candidate in regulating the BHJ nanoscale morphology and reaching more efficient organic solar cells.
4. Experimental section
ITO-Coated glass substrates were washed in ultrasonic baths by sequentially immersing the substrates in isopropanol once, detergent once, deionized water three times, and isopropanol once, each for 15 min, then baked at 70 °C for 3 h in an oven. After that, ITO substrates were treated with UV ozone for 15 min (NovaScan UV Ozone Cleaner), and then 2PACz (0.27 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the precleaned ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s to obtain 2PACz films. ITO/2PACz films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min on a hotplate in a nitrogen-filled glove box where the active layers were spun on the top. The donor PM6 and acceptor Y6 derivatives (Y6, Y6-BO, L8-BO, and BTP-eC9) with different solvent additives (CN, DIO, HBrT, and FBT) were kept at 1:1.2 in chloroform (CF). The total concentration of all the blend solutions was 16 mg mL−1. The solutions were stirred at 50–100 °C for > 1 h in a glovebox and then spin-coated on ITO/2PACz substrates, active layers with a thickness of ∼100 nm were obtained. The active layers were deposited under vacuum for >30 min to extract the additives (FBrT, HBrT, DIO, and CN) residue before 10 min annealing at 80 °C. A 5 nm-thick PDINN layer was spun on the top, thereafter (1 mg mL−1 in methanol, spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 10 s). Finally, a 100 nm-thick Ag film was deposited by thermal evaporation at a pressure of <3 × 10−4 Pa in a glovebox to complete the device fabrication.

Broader context
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have gained considerable attention from academia and industry due to their advantages such as low-cost fabrication into flexible, lightweight, and semitransparent devices. Incorporating solvent additive into host solvent is recognized as an effective strategy in reaching optimal nanoscale morphology and enhancing efficiency. Whereas, how to design effective solvent additives is still to be defined. It should be emphasized that (i) the organic photovoltaic materials have thiophene building blocks along their backbones, (ii) “like dissolve like” is the basic principle for choosing good solvents for chemicals. To this end, we designed two thiophene derivatives 2,5-dibromothiophene (HBrT) and 2,5-dibromo-3,4-difluoro-thiophene (FBrT), which can finely dissolve the photovoltaic materials, providing meaningful strategy in prolonging crystallization and phase separation kinetic process. As result, the PM6:Y6 based OSCs with FBrT additive reached a significantly improved efficiency of nearing 18.0% and promising fill factor of 78.6%. More strikingly, FBrT additive possesses general applicability in L8-BO, Y6-BO, and BTP-eC9 based OSCs and achieves significantly enhanced efficiencies of 18.6–18.7% in devices. Moreover, how the structural modification (fluorination and bromination) of thiophene derivatives impact the nanoscale morphology was systematic studied. These findings highlight the significant effect of thiophene derivatives in the morphology control.
