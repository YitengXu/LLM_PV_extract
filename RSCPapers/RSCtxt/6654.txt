1. Introduction
Hydrogen (H2) is a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuels due to its high energy density and zero carbon emissions.1,2 Water electrolysis, powered by renewable and clean energy sources (e.g., wind, solar, tidal, and geothermal energy), produces H2 in a sustainable manner, and greatly needs electrocatalysts that can decrease the overpotential associated with the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER).3,4 So far, the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts are platinum (Pt) for HER and iridium (Ir) and ruthenium (Ru) oxides for OER, which are however severely impeded by high cost and low earth-abundance.5,6
Efforts have been devoted to reducing the use of noble-metals, or completely replacing noble-metals with earth-abundant elements,7 for which surface and interface engineering on electrocatalysts is of great importance.8 Comprising a core (inner material) and a shell (outer layer material), core–shell electrocatalysts are capable of enabling efficiency and long-term durability in water splitting,9 as illustrated in Fig. 1. On the one hand, core–shell nanostructures with few noble-metals as thin shells can obviously reduce catalyst cost,10 and more importantly can enable strong interactions between core components (e.g., metal carbides) and noble-metals,11–13 which renders the composites highly active and stable. On the other hand, core–shell nanostructures have been introduced into a large variety of noble-metal-free electrocatalysts, including transition-metals (TMs) and their (hydr)oxides [TM(H)Os], carbides (TMCs), dichalcogenides (TMDs), phosphides (TMPs), etc., which successfully achieve comparable or even better performance in comparison with noble-metals.14–16 Engineering on core–shell nanostructures serves as the key to producing highly exposed active surface, to rationally modifying electronic/chemical configurations of interfacial sites, to fulfilling synergic enhancement involving multiple sites on cores and shells, and to reinforcing long-term durability in corrosive electrolytes under the protection of robust shells.17 The progress in 2D material (e.g., graphene, BN and MoS2) encapsulated non-noble-metals as typical core–shell structures have been reviewed for electrocatalysis and energy conversion.18–20 However, a larger variety of inorganics are available to construct core–shell catalysts that afford diverse improvements and working mechanisms in electrocatalysis. It is necessary to have a comprehensive review covering the boom in core–shell electrocatalysts for water splitting, which will help us to understand the roles of core/shell components, and more importantly to provide insights into electrocatalytic mechanisms on their engineered surfaces and interfaces. From the viewpoint of cost-efficiency, those free from or with few noble-metals should be involved.
 Fig. 1  Schematic overview of core–shell electrocatalysts. 
Here, we aim to provide an overview on cost-efficient core–shell electrocatalysts for water electrolysis, with a particular emphasis on their varied electronic/chemical configurations and the consequent optimized binding energies of their reaction intermediates. This review first introduces the structural characteristics of core–shell materials and their advantages for electrocatalysis. And then, representative core–shell electrocatalysts, including noble-metal shelled and noble-metal-free nanostructures, are comprehensively discussed to highlight the structure–activity relationship and working mechanism of core/shell components in the promoted electrocatalysis. Finally, we offer a perspective on the future development of core–shell electrocatalysts. This review is anticipated to provide some guidelines for the rational structural engineering on cost-efficient catalysts used in sustainable energy conversion and storage.
2. Core–shell electrocatalysts
2.1 Core–shell nanostructures
Core–shell nanostructures are defined as composites consisting of cores (inner material) and shells (outer layer material) on the nanoscale.21 The terms “core–shell”, “core@shell” and “core/shell” are used to describe this unique nanostructure in references, which will be followed in this review according to the usage in the cited references. When it comes to their morphology, the first thing that comes to mind is concentric spheres: that is, core–shell particles. However, they are not limited to particles, but also can be one-dimensional (1D) nanorods or nanowires, two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets or three-dimensional (3D) framework structures that can be encapsulated by some shells. With regards to specific requirements in application, the components of cores and shells will be different. The core and shell compositions can be either organic or inorganic, so there are four possible combinations of these: i.e., organic–organic, organic–inorganic, inorganic–organic and inorganic–inorganic core–shell structures. Organic materials, including various polymers and other high-density materials, are almost all insulators, while inorganic materials are metals, metal compounds and carbon/graphene, which are conductors or semiconductors. As electrocatalysts for water splitting, they require good electrical conductivity. Only a few conductive polymers (e.g., polyaniline) can be used as a shell or a core.22 Core–shell electrocatalysts are thereby focused on the inorganic–inorganic type. The components of such electrocatalysts can be carbon (e.g., graphite, amorphous carbon, graphene, or reduced graphene oxide), metals and metal-related compounds (e.g., carbides, oxides, phosphides, sulfides, or selenides). For example, oxides are used as the core in most cases, and some serve as the shells of OER catalysts. Most carbides and phosphides are cores with an outer carbon/graphene shell. These shells are typically formed in situ during the preparation of carbides and phosphides at high temperature, and can protect the cores from corrosion and promote electron transport during electrocatalysis.23 As for noble-metal components, they have been applied as the shell coating on non-precious cores in order to reduce their dosage.
2.2 Advantages of core–shell electrocatalysts
The advantages of core–shell electrocatalysts can be summarized as follows. Firstly, robust shells afford available protection for active cores during catalyst preparation and electrocatalytic reactions, which enables highly exposed catalytic sites and thus high performance in long-term electrolysis. For example, carbon capsulation is introduced on the one hand to confine the growth of TMs and TMCs that are easily aggregated/sintered during fabrication at extremely high temperature, and on the other hand to protect active cores from corrosion by strong acidic or alkaline electrolytes.24,25 Secondly, the strong interactions between core and shell components serve as feasible modifications on the electronic/chemical configurations of active sites, which is of great importance to optimize the bindings of reaction intermediates and improve the intrinsic activity. The lattice strain of shells and interfacial electronic redistribution in core–shell nanostructures can move the d-band centers to satisfy HER and OER kinetics accordingly.17,26 Thirdly, core–shell nanostructures consisting of different active sites are expected to synergistically address the multiple elementary steps of the HER and OER. For example, nickel hydroxides and oxides, being capable of dissociating water molecules, are introduced as shells to accelerate the H2O discharge step in alkaline HER.27,28 And fourthly, a highly conductive component, whether as the core or the shell, can accelerate electron transport and promote activity in electrocatalytic processes.
In particular, the interactions in core–shell nanostructures, which are beneficial for enhanced electrocatalysis, are either the strain effect induced by the structure or electron transfer between two components.29,30 The strain effect arises when the shell atom geometry is compressed or expanded due to lattice mismatch with core lattices.31 Generally, tensile strain lowers the coordination numbers of surface atoms, and thus brings about a reduced bandwidth and an upshifting of the d-band center. Compressive lattice strain has the opposite effect, causing a broadening of the bands and a downshifting of the d-band center. Because the antibonding states below the Fermi level are sensitive to the position of the d-band center, the above shifting can effectively vary the bindings of adsorbates. The upshifting results in strengthened bindings with *H and *OH intermediates, and vice versa. For example, Stamenkovic and co-workers proved that the strain effect of a Pt-rich shell on Pt3Ni nanoframes was beneficial for enhanced HER in alkaline solution (0.1 M KOH), surpassing that of commercial Pt/C or solid PtNi/C.32 Moreover, the electron transfer occurs between two different atom groups and causes changes in electronic band structures, serving as another key factor to improve electrocatalytic kinetics.33 Recently, Qiao and co-workers exploited core–shell Ru@IrOx in which a strong charge redistribution existed between a highly strained ruthenium core and a partially oxidized iridium shell.34 The increased valence of the IrOx shell and the decreased valence of the Ru core activated a synergistic electronic and structural interaction, resulting in enhanced OER activity and stability in 0.05 M H2SO4 compared with most state-of-the-art materials. It should be noted that both the effects of lattice strain and electron re-distribution on interfaces can independently change the adsorbed states of reactive intermediates in an electrocatalytic reaction, but their coexistence unfortunately obscures the origin of the overall activity, especially for reactions involving several different reactive species. Recently, Qiao and co-workers used core–shell Ru@Pt and Ru–Pt alloy models with an identical electron-transfer effect but different surface geometries to unveil the mechanism responsible for their enhanced activity in alkaline HER.35 Ru@Pt, with a highly compressive strained surface, exhibited much higher activity than the strain-free RuPt alloy, which indicated the better interaction toward both *H and *OH and consequently promoted overall activity due to the compressive strain. In such a state, the surface strain was a more dominant factor in comparison with the electron-transfer effect.
Although the strain and electron-transfer effects are often investigated in noble-metal electrocatalysts, they are also available for noble-metal-free components that fall within the scope of this review. For example, Chhowalla et al. gave evidence that the lattice mismatch between 1T- and 2H-phase WS2 resulted in a distorted 1T superlattice phase.36 On the surface of distorted 1T-phase WS2, strain could significantly influence the free energy of *H, in which 2.7% tensile strain reduced the free energy from 0.28 eV to 0: i.e., thermoneutral conditions. Similarly, strain on MoS2 was also achieved and utilized towards efficient electrocatalysis via heteroatom doping, lattice mismatch and bending with substrates.37–39 Such functionalities would be available in core–shell nanostructures.
2.3 Synthetic strategies for core–shell electrocatalysts
The synthetic strategies for nanostructures can be roughly divided into two categories: top-down and bottom-up.21,40 The former downsizes large-sized (from micron to centimeter) materials through various etching techniques (e.g., electron or ion beam, laser-beam processing and polishing). The latter exploits the chemical properties of the molecules to cause them to self-assemble into some useful conformations.21 The most common bottom-up methods are chemical synthesis, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), self-assembly, colloidal aggregation, and film deposition and growth. They are commonly used to design core–shell electrocatalysts, in which the size, morphology, facets, and textural properties can be controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions, such as precursor concentration, temperature, and surfactant.40 There are three major classes for the bottom-up synthesis of core–shell electrocatalysts (Fig. 2). (i) Simultaneous fabrication. The simultaneous approach is mostly applied to fabricate catalysts with carbon-coated metals or their compounds, in which the reactants are directly mixed to prepare a precursor. Then, during the pyrolysis process, metal compounds are formed as the core, and carbon-containing substances at the same time evolve into a carbon shell and wrap around the core.41 (ii) Sequential fabrication. This takes more steps to first prepare the core and then the shell. This method is suitable for all reported core–shell structural composite nanoparticle systems regardless of the instability of some cores. (iii) Galvanic replacement reaction. This method involves a redox reaction between the metal core and the required shell ions, depending on the potential difference between two metals. It is commonly applicable to noble-metal-based core–shell nanostructures, and can be performed in organic or aqueous media without the need for other reducing agents.
 Fig. 2  Synthetic strategies for core–shell electrocatalysts. 
It should be noted that some shell-free nanostructures will evolve in situ to core–shell electrocatalysts during electrocatalytic reactions, which fulfil functionalities associated with core–shell structures. For example, Zou et al. showed that core–shell Fe@FeOxSy nanoparticles as the catalytically active phase were generated in situ on FeS nanosheets during the HER in 1.0 M KOH,42 and Chen et al. experimentally discovered the formation of an oxide shell on metallic Co4N nanowires during the OER.43 These in situ formed core–shell structures are beneficial for electrochemical kinetics, and will provide new interpretations for the electrocatalytic mechanism in a working state.
3. Core–shell catalysts with noble-metal shells
Regarding the high cost and low reserves of noble-metals, depositing them on noble-metal-free cores to construct core–shell catalysts is a feasible way to reduce electrocatalyst cost and more importantly to maintain or even increase activity. Alloying noble-metals with non-precious metals is another strategy, but it suffers from the easy corrosion of non-precious elements directly exposed to electrolytes and the low availability of noble elements inside alloys.44,45 Such demerits are avoided in core–shell nanostructures. More importantly, the lattice strain and interfacial electron redistribution, associated with strong interactions between core and shell regions, affect the band states of the metal shells. Such effects are of great importance in determining the thermodynamic states of reaction intermediates on surface sites and subsequently the kinetic barriers in electrocatalysis.11
3.1 Ir-Based shells
Typically, the OER occurs at a highly anodic potential region under which nearly all the elements stay in their corresponding oxidized states, rendering the catalysts much more difficult to stabilize.6 This is particularly true for an acidic environment, and only the oxides of Ir and Ru are known to show acceptable stability and high activity. To reduce Ir loading, Tackett et al. developed Ir/M4N (M = Fe, Co, Ni) core–shell electrocatalysts for the OER in 0.5 M H2SO4, in which an Ir shell was oxidized to IrO2 during the OER.10 Such a core–shell nanostructure ensured an obviously reduced Ir mass loading by a factor of 2 compared to standard IrO2. In particular, IrO2/Fe4N was more active than and at least as stable as IrO2 nanoparticles on a per-mass Ir and per-site basis. Density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations identified a 0.13 eV positive shift in [ΔG(O*) − ΔG(OH*)] on IrO2/Fe4N compared to IrO2(110), which brought the OER activity of IrO2/Fe4N close to the predicted volcano peak. This work offered a framework to further optimize activity and minimize Ir loading. Analogously, Zhang et al. reported 3D hierarchical Ir-based multi-metallic alloy nanoframes, with a Cu-rich@Ni-rich@Ir-rich double-core–shell architecture.46 They showed outstanding activity with low η10 values of 41 and 262 mV for the HER and OER, respectively, in an acidic environment. To achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for overall water splitting, they required a low cell voltage of only 1.53 V.
Dealloying of other metal elements from Ir-based composites via anodic oxidation is a feasible way to design core-shelled IrOx with prominent OER performance.47 Jaramillo and co-workers reported an IrOx/SrIrO3 catalyst formed during electrochemical testing by strontium leaching from surface layers of thin films of SrIrO3,48 which delivered an overpotential (η10) of only 270–290 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 after a continuous durability test for 30 h. DFT calculation (Fig. 3) identified the possible active species of anatase IrO2 (Fig. 3d) or IrO3 (Fig. 3g) shells after strontium leaching, both of which afforded a similar theoretical overpotential of 0.28 V, approaching the peak of the OER volcano (Fig. 3a). These species also exhibited an ideal adsorption property without breaking the scaling relationship between various O-containing species (Fig. 3j). However, the exact structure of the surface formed during reaction was still unknown.

Strasser and co-workers carried out systematic research on IrNiOx core–shell OER electrocatalysts formed in situ via electrochemical Ni leaching and concomitant Ir oxidation.49–52 They accomplished a multi-fold enhancement in catalytic activity and obviously enhanced long-term durability over benchmark IrO2 and RuO2 on a noble-metal mass basis. For example, IrNix@IrOx nanoparticles supported on high-surface-area mesoporous antimony-doped tin oxide were synthesized from bimetallic IrNix precursor alloys using anodic oxidation.52 The core–shell catalyst supported a 2.5 times higher oxygen evolution rate, and corresponding hydrogen evolution rate, at the electrolyzer level, while showing negligible degradation during a 20 h stability test. Furthermore, they probed the local geometric ligand environment and electronic states of oxygen-coordinated iridium centers in nickel-leached IrNi@IrOx core–shell nanoparticles under OER conditions.51 It was experimentally identified that the OER reactivity of IrNi@IrOx, normalized to the mass of Ir and the number of electrochemically accessible Ir sites surpassed those of bare IrOx (Fig. 4a and b). According to in operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and ex situ resonant high-energy X-ray diffraction (HE-XRD) investigations, it was concluded that Ni leaching brought about a large number of vacancies in the IrOx shell, which in turn produced abundant d-band holes in comparison with IrOx nanoparticles. The concomitant lowering of the Ir 5d energy led to an increase in the hole character on the oxygen ligands, and consequently shortened Ir–O bonds. The enhanced electrophilic character of these oxygen ligands endowed them with smaller kinetic barriers during the OER due to energetically favorable acid–base O–O bond formation that involved the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule or hydroxyl ligand on the electrophilic oxygens (Fig. 4c). The above examples highlight the importance of in situ formed IrOx core–shell nanostructures for the OER in acidic electrolytes, and the exact shell structure, geometric ligand environment, and electronic state are the key factors for electrocatalysis, which will require insightful understanding and rational engineering in future research.

3.2 Ru-Based shells
In comparison with Ir-based materials, Ru and its oxides exhibit significant catalytic activity, but they suffer from poor stability due to the formation of soluble high-oxidation state RuO4 during the OER.53 Their core–shell nanostructures have also attracted much attention as electrocatalysts for water splitting. Wu et al. loaded Ni@Ru core–shell nanoparticles onto flower-like carbon flakes, which exhibited excellent HER and OER activity, and showed superior durability to that of Pt/C and RuO2, respectively.54 The electrocatalytic activity increased at first and then decreased with increasing Ru content, indicating that Ru was the active species, and the electronic interaction between the core and shell was also important. If the Ru was excessive, the atoms on the outer layer were far away from the core, which weakened the electronic interaction and resulted in declining activity. Similar core–shell structured hexagonal sandwiches of Ni@Ru and NiCo@Ru (denoted Ni@Ru HNS and Ni3Cox@Ru HNS, respectively) with tunable cores were also developed as OER catalysts (Fig. 5a).55 The NiCo core in Ni3Co3@Ru HNS promoted the generation of oxidized Ru species (Ru4+), which boosted the OER activity. In N2-saturated 1.0 M KOH, Ni3Co3@Ru HNS needed an overpotential of only 300 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, superior to that of RuO2 black (Fig. 5b). Hollow RuNiCo HNC was further obtained after simple acid etching of Ni3Co3@Ru HNS. Although the surface area of RuNiCo HNC was relatively larger, the OER activity was inferior to that before etching (Fig. 5c), confirming the important role of the core to increase activity. Analogously, Zhang et al. tailored the Ru shell to an RuM (M = Ni or Co) alloy on an Ni core via a one-pot reduction method.56 The tunable Ru-based alloy layer served as a class of highly efficient electrocatalysts with obviously higher mass activity for HER and OER, in comparison with commercial Pt/C and Ru, respectively. The excellent durability of Ni@RuNi for both the HER and OER was further confirmed by an accelerated durability test and chronoamperometry measurement.

3.3 Pd and Pt-based shells
Other efforts have been devoted to core–shell electrocatalysts with Pd or Pt shells. Li et al. prepared Ni@Pd core–shell nanospheres with various thicknesses, loaded on polyethyleneimine-reduced graphene oxide, via a one-pot synthesis process.57 This hybrid structure enabled a clear correlation to be seen between the HER performance and Pd thickness. The activity increased with a decrease in Pd thickness, which could be ascribed to the electron flow from Ni (111) to Pd (111). A suitable shell thickness endowed the composites with good HER activity with an η200 of 150 mV and a Tafel slope of 54 dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4. Wang et al. prepared Ni@Pt core–shell hexagonal nanoplates as OER catalysts, from Ni–Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors.58 They showed higher activity and stability in 1.0 M KOH, in comparison with RuO2 or IrO2. Similar core–shell nanostructures can be derived from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs): e.g., Co@Pd and Ni@Pt supported by N-doped carbon.59,60
Moreover, tungsten carbides with Pt-like electronic configurations were considered as feasible cores to promote electrocatalysis on Pt and Pd shells. Efforts made by Chen and co-workers identified that monolayer (ML) Pt-WC catalysts represented the lower limit of Pt loading, allowing for a significant decrease in Pt costs in devices such as fuel cells and electrolyzers.61 DFT calculations and experimental measurements indicated that the ML Pt-WC surface exhibited chemical and electronic properties that were very similar to those of bulk Pt. They experimentally proved that Pt-WC core–shell catalysts can greatly reduce the amount of Pt and that the HER activity was comparable to that of bulk Pt.62 Román-Leshkov and co-workers proposed the self-assembly of TMC nanoparticles coated with atomically thin Pt and PtRu monolayers by carburizing mixtures of noble-metal salts and transition-metal oxides encapsulated in removable silica templates (Fig. 6a).13 This approach allowed for the control of the final core–shell architecture, including particle size, monolayer coverage, and heterometallic composition. In particular, carbon-supported Ti0.1W0.9C nanoparticles coated with Pt or bimetallic PtRu monolayers exhibited higher performance for the HER and the H2 oxidation reaction (HOR) in comparison with Pt and PtRu nanoparticles, and more importantly presented obviously enhanced resistance to sintering and CO poisoning in the HOR and methanol electrooxidation (Fig. 6b–d). The above strategy was further extended to farbicate Pt shells on TiWN nanoparticles, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed significant core-level shifts for Pt shells, corresponding to increased stabilization of the Pt valence d-states.63 Such electronic modulation due to the nitride core translated into enhanced CO tolerance during hydrogen electrooxidation. The enhancement of Pt shells by TMC and TMN cores was further interpretated by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. This indicated that the ligand effects came from the hybridization of Pt and W d states at the core–shell interface.64 The heterometallic bonding between the shell and the core elements led to a broadening of the Pt valence d-band, a downshift of the d-band center, and greatly reduced adsorbate binding energies.

Table 1 summarizes representative core–shell nanostructures with noble-metal shells as high-performance electrocatalysts for the HER and OER. It is clear that core–shell nanostructures can obviously reduce the mass loading of noble-metals towards high mass specific activity for electrocatalytic water splitting. To this end, the rich interactions associated with core materials are the key, which requires rational engineering on core–shell interfaces. At first, the matching electronic configurations of the core and noble-metal shell can enhance their interfacial interations. The d states of metals (e.g., Ni55 and Cu46), TMCs (e.g., WC11) and TMNs (e.g., TiWN63) render them reactive to boost noble-metal shells in electrocatalysis. Another key issue is to effectively control shell thickness, because a thick shell not only weakens the interfacial interactions, but also undoubtedly increases the catalyst cost. Beyond the obviously improved mass specific activity, such interfacial interactions have also proved an enhancement in long-term durability: e.g., the cases of Pt-TMCs and Pt-TMNs.13,63

4. Core–shell electrocatalysts free from noble-metals
In this section, we focus on earth-abundant transition-metals (e.g., Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, W) and their compounds as cost-efficient electrocatalysts. The abundance of Fe, Co, Ni, Mo and W in the earth is 6.8%, 0.0089%, 0.003%, 0.00011% and 0.00011%, respectively, much higher than that of Pt (3.7 × 10−6%).3 However, the electrocatalytic activity of such metals is usually inferior to that of noble-metals. To improve the performance, rational engineering on the active phase and surface is highly desirable. Constructing core–shell structures is one effective strategy.
4.1 Transition-metals as cores

4.1.1 Co and Ni. 
As the core of a core–shell catalyst, a metal or its alloy with high electrical conductivity can accelerate electron transport in an electrocatalytic reaction.65,66 Moreover, their electronic interactions with shells can regulate the adsorption energy of intermediates towards favored electrochemical kinetics. Xu et al. developed 3D porous microrod arrays constructed from carbon-confined NiCo@NiCoO2 core–shell nanoparticles (NiCo@NiCoO2/C PMRAs) via the reductive carbonization of bimetallic (Ni, Co) MOFs and subsequent controlled oxidative calcination (Fig. 7a).67 This structure featured merits including large specific surface areas, high conductivity, and multiple electrocatalytically active sites and rich oxygen vacancies. In particular, the oxygen vacancies that were identified by XPS (Fig. 7b) could improve the conductivity of NiCoO2 and accelerate the kinetics of the OER. It required an overpotential of only 366 mV to reach a current density of 20 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 7c). Meanwhile, the core–shell engineering on ZIF-67-derived Co@Co3O4 was achieved via effective control over the oxidation processes of Co.68 Benefiting from its abundant oxygen vacancies and tetrahedral Co2+, the potential synergies of CoOx species and N-doped carbon, and the efficient mass transfer of hollow and yolk–shell structures, Co@Co3O4 afforded high activity for both the OER and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Similar core–shell Co@CoO nanoparticles,69 Co@Co3O4 nanosheets,70 dendritic Ni@Ni(Fe)OOH,71 and NiCo@NiCo2O4 nanochain arrays72 were also developed as bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting.

When transition-metals are used as active components in a strong acid solution, they are easily corroded. A conductive carbon shell can address this issue to prolong the durability of catalysts.23,25,73–82 In the meantime, the metal core can also change the work function of the carbon shell to promote electrocatalysis. For example, N-doped carbon encapsulation was proved to improve the HER and OER performance of Co and FeCo active materials.74,83 Ye and co-workers introduced N,B-co-doped ultrathin carbon cages to encapsulate Co cores for efficient HER.73 The carbon shells contributed to the HER as the main active sites, rather than uncoated Co species. DFT calculations indicated that the synergetic effect between Co and the carbon shell was beneficial for HER kinetics. Bao and co-workers developed an N-doped graphene shell (only 1–3 layers) encapsulated uniform CoNi alloy (CoNi@NC) for the HER in acid solution.23 It exhibited favorable activity in 0.1 M H2SO4 with an η10 of 104 mV, and fairly good structural and activity stability for 24 hours. As further indicated by DFT calculations (Fig. 8a and b), the adsorption of H* on the CoNi alloy was too strong whereas it was too weak on the N-doped graphene shell, accounting for the low HER activity in both cases. In comparison, the ΔG(H*) value for the graphene shells of CoNi@C can be effectively tuned by the encapsulated CoNi alloy, resulting in high HER activity. Interestingly, increasing the number of nitrogen atoms from zero to three per shell led to a decrease in ΔG(H*) for graphene shells without an enclosed CoNi cluster (Fig. 8c), and the presence of the CoNi cluster resulted in a further decrease in ΔG(H*), which suggested that nitrogen dopants and enclosed metal clusters synergistically optimized the adsorption of hydrogen. To further interpret the interactions between a CoNi core and a graphene shell, the differential electron densities on their interface were considered (Fig. 8d). It is clear that the electron of a CoNi cluster could penetrate through three graphene layers. Accordingly, the differences in the ΔG(H*) [ΔΔG(H*)] with and without a CoNi cluster observably decreased when the number of graphene layers was increased from one to three (Fig. 8e), indicating the substantial influence of graphene layer thickness on HER activity. The thinner graphene shells accounted for the higher activity. In order to control the shell thickness of Co@NC, Mo et al. proposed a simple method via directly changing the temperature and gas flow rate during the pyrolysis of ZIF-67 precursors.84 The evaluated temperature and gas flow were useful to reduce shell thickness, and optimal conditions (T = 775 °C and vAr = 150 mL min−1) were adopted to achieve an ultrathin but seamless N-doped carbon shell. Such structural features enabled excellent HER activity with η10 of 82 and 95 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively.

Co and Ni cores with other shells have also been developed for efficient water electrolysis. For example, Liu and co-workers presented Co@CoS2 core–shell nanoparticles encapsulated by N,S-co-doped carbon nanotubes.85 The self-growing carbon nanotubes protected the nanoparticles from being corroded by the electrolyte. Thanks to the Mott–Schottky effect, the nanoparticles accelerated the electron transport between the metallic Co and semiconductor CoS2 interface and enriched the protons on the interface. Qin et al. proposed in situ synthesis of Ni@Ni3C core–shell hierarchical nanospheres via an ionic liquid-assisted hydrothermal method at relatively low temperature.86 Benefiting from the high electrical conductivity, more exposed active sites, and core–shell interfacial effects, the nanospheres exhibited outstanding OER performance in 0.1 M KOH solution, in terms of a low overpotential (η10 = 350 mV), a small Tafel slope (57.6 mV dec−1), and excellent stability (24 h of i–t measurement without obvious current loss).


4.1.2 Others. 
Attention has been also paid to Fe, Cu, V and Zn-based core–shell electrocatalysts.76,87–91 Fu et al. synthesized ZnCo-Fe core–shell nanocages from MOF precursors for efficient OER.90 The optimized nanocages not only retained the large surface area structure, abundant active sites and efficient charge transfer efficiency of the MOF, but also gained synergetic effects benefitting the electrochemical reaction. As a result, they showed excellent OER activity in O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH (η10 = 176 mV). Li et al. designed Fe@FeP core–shell nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes (Fe@FeP/CNT) via successive preparation (Fig. 9a).87 Compared to hollow FeP/CNT, the presence of an Fe core allowed Fe@FeP/CNT to express good HER performance with a low η10 value of only 53 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 (Fig. 9b). As indicated by Bader charge analysis, the Fe core enabled electron transfer to the FeP shell, which enhanced the adsorption capacity of reaction intermediates on FeP. The hydrogen adsorption energy on Fe@FeP was comparable to that of Pt (Fig. 9c). Najam et al. prepared a metal–nitrogen-doped carbon shield on NiFe nanoparticles as HER and OER catalysts.76 A synergistic effect together with electron penetration from the doped shell to the metal core was responsible for the enhancement in the surface catalytic reaction.

Although Mo and W are inert for electrolytic water splitting, they can be used as a reactive and conductive core to accelerate the HER and OER on interfaces. For example, W@WC core–shell dodecahedrons proved higher HER performance in comparison with WC.92 Chueh and co-workers successfully developed hierarchical Mo/MoSe2 core–shell nanoscrews through plasma-assisted selenization as an HER catalyst (Fig. 10a).93 The Mo conductive substrates not only separated 1T- and 2H-MoSe2 from each other (Fig. 10b) to produce more accessible active sites, but also accelerated electron transfer between catalysts and electrodes. With rich edge sites and defects, the nanoscrews exhibited an extremely low Tafel slope of 34.7 mV dec−1 (Fig. 10c) which was close to that of Pt (29 mV dec−1). In addition, even with metastable 1T-MoSe2, such a core–shell catalyst still showed excellent stability for the HER with only a slight decrease after 1000 cycles (Fig. 10d).

Table 2 summarizes the HER and OER performance of representative core–shell electrocatalysts with various TMs as cores. There is a common sense that a corrosion-resistant shell (such as thin carbon) can protect susceptible TMs cores from corrosion in strong acidic and alkaline electrolytes. It is very interesting to find that the ultrathin carbon layers are activated by electron penetration from metal cores, which renders the initially inert carbon sites highly active for electrocatalysis, and opens up new opportunities to improve both activity and stability. Follow-up research proved that introducing heteroatoms (such as N, P or S) into graphene/carbon layers can effectively tune the electronic properties of surface carbon atoms towards the further enhanced electrocatalysis. Moreover, metal oxides and sulfides are also avaible as the shell for TM cores. It was identified that the metal core can transfer electrons into the shell and establish an internal electric field at their interface until they obtain the same Fermi level, changing the work function of the shell and thereby endowing it with unexpectedly high activity.

4.2 TM(H)Os as cores

4.2.1 Co and Ni (hydr)oxides. 
Transition-metal (hydro)oxides [TM(H)Os] are also taken as cores to construct high-performance core–shell electrocatalysts. In particular, Co and Ni based TM(H)Os have been extensively investigated. Zhang and co-workers proposed a simple ethanol-modified sulfuration method to fabricate CoNi hydroxide@hydroxysulfide (Co1.8Ni(OH)5.6@Co1.8NiS0.4(OH)4.8), which had a nanoscale core–shell heterostructure with a crystalline core and an amorphous shell.94 As suggested, amorphous catalysts have shown encouraging electrochemical performance superior to that of corresponding crystalline catalysts.95–97 As depicted in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Fig. 11a–d), a cotton-like amorphous shell (∼4 nm) with S element can clearly be observed. Owing to the higher polarization ability of sulfur than that of oxygen, a moderate amount of sulfur in the shell could adjust the electronic structures of Co and Ni to be favorable for the OER. In the XPS profile, the Co 2p peak gradually moved to a lower binding energy with increasing S content, indicating electron transfer between elements. As for the OER in 0.1 M KOH (Fig. 11e and f), Co1.8Ni(OH)5.6@Co1.8NiS0.4(OH)4.8 afforded a low η10 of only 274.0 mV and a Tafel slope of 45 mV dec−1, outperforming CoNi hydroxide or CoNi hydroxysulfide. This highlighted that the synergistic effect mainly contributed to the supreme activity. Analogously, the core–shell catalysts of crystalline Co(ZnxNi2−x)O4 nanorods and amorphous NiO nanosheets also exhibited robust and stable OER activity.98

Owing to their excellent conductivity, good corrosion resistance and high surface activity, spinel materials are efficient electrocatalysts in alkaline solution. Previous efforts have identified the bi-functionality of CoNi/CoFe2O4 and spinel-type lithium cobalt oxide for water splitting.99,100 Chen et al. synthesized a 3D flexible self-supporting electrode on carbon cloth made up of an NiCo2O4 nanowire core and an NiCo2O4 nanoflake shell towards efficient OER.101 Ji et al. described a CoFe2O4@Co–Fe–Bi core–shell nanoarray with good activity and durability for water oxidation in 0.1 M potassium borate, which could be ascribed to the strong surface interactions with OER intermediates O* and OOH*.102 This research points out the promise of spinel-type metal oxides to construct core-shelled electrocatalysts with high performance.
The proper assembly of core-shelled nanoparticles is also important to fulfil their functionality. Usually, a 3D superlattice composed of ordered and close-packed nanoparticles possesses a high surface area, abundant active sites, and collective characteristics that are different from those of isolated/disordered nanoparticles.103 And the incorporation of a carbon skeleton between adjacent nanoparticles can improve the poor inherent conductivity of individual nanoparticles.104 Zheng and co-workers developed a highly ordered N-doped carbon-coated Co–Mn oxide nanoparticle superlattice as an efficient bi-functional water-splitting electrocatalyst.105 The Co–Mn–O nanoparticles enabled good OER activity due to the enhanced excitation of charge carriers to the conduction band, and the CN framework served as an excellent HER catalyst.


4.2.2 Others (hydr)oxides. 
Engineering on core–shell nanostructures can endow Cu-based materials that have been identified with robust OER performance in neutral to weakly alkaline electrolytes.106–109 Zhang et al. prepared a carbon–shell encapsulated Cu2O (Cu2O@C) with an average diameter of only 4–6 nm by a photocatalytic method, which served as a highly efficient OER catalyst.110 The conductive shell could transfer electrons from the electrolyte to Cu2O and prevent the aggregation of Cu2O nanoparticles during the OER process. A suitable shell thickness facilitated electron transfer and quickly increased current density. Xia et al. demonstrated a novel and highly efficient hybrid electrocatalyst composed of an NiFeCr hydroxide deposited on a porous peapod-like Cu@CeO2 nanotube array.111 Doan et al. identified rich defects and modulated the surface chemistry on CuO@CoP nanowires for efficient water electrocatalysis.112 Cu-Based oxides and hydroxides as cores were also incorporated with other TM(H)Os to improve the OER performance, such as CuO@Co3O4 and Cu(OH)2@CoCO3(OH)2·nH2O core–shell arrays.113 The highly exposed active sites and interfacial synergetic effects effectively boosted the OER activity.
In addition, some metal oxides (e.g., MoO2 and MoOx) with metallic features can serve as conductive cores to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of TMDs (e.g., MoS2).114–116 For example, Jin et al. have reported an MoOx–MoS2 core–shell nanotubular material, in which the MoOx core with high conductivity accelerated electron transportation, and the MoS2 shell with high-density defects provided catalytic sites and corrosion resistance.115 Sometimes, MoO2 has also been considered as the active phase for the HER. Tang et al. fabricated MoO2 particles encapsulated by P-doped carbon for efficient HER in acidic media, owing to the synergistic effects among highly dispersive MoO2, P-doped porous carbon, and reduced graphene oxide substrates.117

Table 3 summarizes the electrocatalytic performance of representative core–shell electrocatalysts with TM(H)Os as cores. TM(H)Os are not stable in acidic electrolytes, so they are usually used for alkaline HER and OER. The rich oxygen vacancies in TM(H)Os are beneficial for adsorbing and activating H2O and OH− species that are the starting reactants of the HER and OER, respectively, in alkaline conditions. To overcome the poor conductivity of TM(H)Os, carbon shells with high conductivity are usually introduced.

4.3 TMPs as cores

4.3.1 TMPs encapsulated by carbon shells. 
TMPs have demonstrated their outstanding performance for electrocatalytic HER and OER,119,120 but they face challenges due to poor conductivity and stability. Meanwhile, P atoms on the TMP surface serve as Lewis bases to adsorb protons,121 and a higher P content on the TMP surface is beneficial for the HER.122–124 To this end, core–shell TMPs with thin carbon encapsulation is an option not only to improve conductivity, but also to retain a relatively high content of P. He et al. discovered that the amorphous carbon shell in an Ni2P@C nanorod array accelerated electron transfer kinetics in the HER.125 The carbon shell also protects the core from corrosion during electrocatalytic processes, as identified on CoP@C nanocables and FeP/C nanoparticles.126,127 The carbon shell encapsulated FeP nanoparticles (Fig. 12a) showed little difference in HER activity, as compared with shell-free FeP, which afforded consistent η10 of only 71 and 73 mV (Fig. 12b), respectively. However, the stability of FeP/C was obviously superior to that without a shell (Fig. 12c). FeP nanoparticles acted as active sites, and carbon shells of thickness <1 nm could protect FeP from oxidation without affecting the surface catalytic reactions. DFT calculations (Fig. 12d) also proved that the oxidation of FeP NPs (without a shell) led to a degradation in HER activity.

Bimetallic phosphides as solid-solution alloys afford opportunities for electronic modulation on catalytic sites and higher catalytic activity than that of corresponding single-metal phosphides.128 For example, varying the composition of Ni2−xCoxP solid-solution-alloys was proved to be effective in ameliorating the d-band state.129 Increasing x in Ni2−xCoxP led to an upshifting of the d-band center towards the EF, and enhanced hydrogen binding on the Ni0.67Co1.33P surface, which accounted for the prominent HER activity over a wide pH range. The introduction of N-doped porous carbon encapsulation further ensured the dual-functionality of CoNiP@CN for the HER and OER.130 Li et al. prepared a single crystal CoMoP core (CoMoP@C) coated with 2–4 layers of N-doped carbon shell by pyrolyzing a mixture of Co16Mo16P24 and dicyandiamide (DCA) (Fig. 13a).128 An H+ adsorption experiment (Fig. 13b) showed that a large number of protons could accumulate on the surface, which might greatly improve the HER activity. CoMoP@C not only exhibited good HER performance in certain solutions in the laboratory (Fig. 13c), but it also delivered excellent activity and stability in complex and real seawater (Fig. 13d). As indicated by DFT calculations (Fig. 13e), the synergistic effect between the CoMoP nanocrystalline core and the N-doped graphitic carbon shell allowed the adsorption free energy of H to approach the thermodynamically neutral value, thus enhancing the electrocatalytic performance.

Previous studies have shown that heteroatom (such as N, P, S, and B) doping is an effective strategy to vary the electronic structure and chemical properties of carbon or graphene.131–136 Yuan and co-workers reported on CoP/Co2P@NC as an efficient electrocatalyst for the HER, in which the N-doped carbon shell not only prevented the agglomeration and corrosion of cobalt phosphide cores, but also contributed a synergistic effect between the core and shell to improve activity.137 Another example from this group was a self-supporting material of Ni2P@NC on nickel foam (Ni2P@NC/NF).138 Besides the decreased resistance owing to the absence of a binder, the non-mechanically bonded materials were robust during the electrochemical process, beneficial for their long-term durability. Zhao et al. designed MoP nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped carbon hollow spheres (denoted MoP@NCHSs) as efficient HER catalysts in alkaline solution.139 The excellent activity benefitted mainly from the synergistic effect between MoP and the N-doped carbon shell, which was correlated with the various N species (graphene N, pyridine N, and pyrrole N). The XPS spectra (Fig. 14a) showed that the highest N content of MoP@NCHSs appeared in the samples obtained at 900 °C. And the graph of j0 suggested that the intrinsic activity was related mainly to the change in pyridine N, but not to the graphene N or pyrrole N (Fig. 14b). Accordingly, DFT calculation further proved that the free energies on pyridine-N-MoP, including those for water dissociation (Fig. 14c) and H*/OH* desorption (Fig. 14d), were helpful to the HER kinetics.

The element P was present during the synthesis of TMPs composites, so it is easy to dope P into carbon shells. Liu and co-workers successfully derived P-doped carbon-coated MoP nanoparticles (MoP@PC) from MOFs as HER catalysts.140 Miao et al. reported a core–shell structured chainmail catalyst composed of Ni2P nanoparticles wrapped in ultrathin P-doped carbon shells on the graphene network.141 This hybrid catalyst needed η10 of only 110 and 150 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively, after a long-term test for more than 24 h. This revealed that the strong electronic interactions between the ultrathin carbon shell and inner Ni2P core, the phosphorus dopant and the neighboring carbon in the shell were responsible for the enhanced electrochemical activity.
When two elements, such as N (χ = 3.0) and P (χ = 2.1), with higher and lower electronegativity (χ) than C (χ = 2.5) are both doped into carbon, the coupling effect between the N and P atoms will endow co-doped carbon with a higher catalytic activity than that of single-doped carbon. Cao and co-workers introduced N,P-doped porous C-coated CoP vertical nanoarrays grown on Ti foils (CoP/NPC/TF).142 The wrinkles and cracks in the nanoarrays provided a rich active surface and porosity to improve reactant accessibility and gas diffusion. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations proved that the introduction of N,P-doped carbon shells not only improved the stability but also greatly promoted HER activity owing to the core–shell synergetic effects and the increase in active sites. In fact, all the C between N and P atoms in the CoP/NPC were the most effective sites for the HER. Huang et al. suggested that doping with N and P enriched the electron density, increased the electrical conductivity and adjusted the inherent electronic properties, which endowed MoP@NCF with excellent HER activity in both acidic and alkaline solution.143


4.3.2 TMPs encapsulated by other shells. 
Other shells were also investigated to improve the electrocatalysis on TMPs. Jin et al. introduced a one-step cyanogel reduction strategy with NaBH4/NaH2PO2 as the reductant to prepare 3D NiCoP@NiCoPOx,144 in which NiCoP was used as a conductive support core and quickly transported electrons to active NiCoPOx during the OER process. Coupled with the fast electron transport and gas diffusion in the 3D structure, NiCoP@NiCoPOx achieved an η10 of 313 mV in 1.0 M KOH. Mo et al. introduced a facile reduction followed by a surface phosphorization to convert surface-oxidized cobalt phosphides to a CoP-Co2(P2O7) core–shell electrocatalyst, accomplishing an obvious improvement in the HER in acidic and alkaline electrolytes.145 Such an improvement could be ascribed to the strong surface acidity of the Co2(P2O7) shell and the promoted HER kinetics on their interfaces. Chang et al. reported core–shell structured Ni12P5/Ni3(PO4)2 hollow spheres with η10 of 114 and 318 mV in 1 M KOH for the HER and OER, respectively.146 Moreover, Zhou et al. introduced CoNiP@LDHs core–shell nanosheet arrays with excellent activity (1.44 V cell voltage at a current density of 10 mA cm−2) and a remarkable long-term durability (∼6 mV degradation after a 500 h OER stability test) for overall water splitting.147

Table 4 summarizes the HER and OER performances of representative core–shell TMP electrocatalysts. Because most TMP core–shell catalysts are prepared through pyrolysis, they are usually encapsulated by thin carbon layers. The carbon shells can prevent the accumulation of phosphides during synthesis to obtain ultra-fine phosphides with highly exposed active sites. Meanwhile, the electronic interactions on TMP-carbon interfaces can be achieved via the formation of P–C and M–C bonds. They modulate the band structure and facilitate fast electron transfer, accumulation, and subsequent delocalization, which are in turn responsible for efficient HER and OER.

4.4 TMDs as cores

4.4.1 Transition-metal sulfides. 
Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), including sulfides and selenides, are active for water electrolysis. In core–shell nanostructures, the TMD core is expected to fulfil synergic enhancement with the designed shells. As a typical core–shell nanostructure of bimetallic TMDs, Co9S8/MoS2, with Co9S8 as the core and layered MoS2 as the shell, has been extensively investigated. Zhu et al. demonstrated a significant enhancement of such core–shell nanostructures in both the HER and OER, which thus served as co-catalysts in electrocatalytic water splitting.149 The high activity was ascribed to the charge distribution on nanosized interfaces, in which electrons transferred from Co to Mo through the intermediate sulfur atoms bonded to both metals. In a similar system of Co9S8/WS2, a half WS2 shell was identified to highly expose Co–S–W interfaces and increase the electron density on edged-S atoms with large amounts of lone-pair electrons, which could accelerate the kinetic adsorption of hydrogen- and oxygen-containing intermediates.150 Other attention has been paid to the surface tensile strain between core–shell interfaces, which can be precisely adjusted by varying the number of MoS2 layers (Fig. 15a–e).151 As the number of layers of MoS2 was altered from 5 layers to 1 layer, the tensile surface strain changed from 0% to 3.5%. Co9S8/1L MoS2 showed the best HER activity with a low η10 value of 97 mV (Fig. 15f). DFT calculations (Fig. 15g) suggested that a larger tensile surface strain from Co9S8/1L MoS2 could regulate the adsorption energy and kinetic energy barrier of transition state H* to enhance the HER activity.

Meanwhile, efforts focusing on the intergration of HER and OER functionalities have been devoted to core–shell TMDs. For example, Yamauchi and co-workers synthesized a Co3S4@MoS2 heterostructured catalyst.152 The synergistic effects between the active and stable HER catalyst of MoS2 and the efficient OER catalyst of Co3S4, as well as the morphological superiority of hollow and core–shell structures, endowed Co3S4@MoS2 with remarkable electrocatalytic performance and robust durability. It exhibited a low overpotential of 280 mV for the OER and 136 mV for the HER at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in an alkaline solution, as well as a low cell voltage of 1.58 V for overall water splitting. Yang et al. developed hierarchical Ni3S2 nanorods wrapped in MoS2 nanosheets as bi-functional electrocatalysts for both the HER and OER,153 in which the hierarchical structure allowed for the good exposure of highly active heterointerfaces, and facilitated charge transport along Ni3S2 nanorods. Qin et al. synthesized NiS-MoS2 core–shell microspheres via a facile ionic liquid-assisted one-step hydrothermal method, which needed an output voltage of only 1.64 V in an alkaline medium to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2.154
There are also other core–shell catalysts using sulfides as the core. Quan et al. successfully grew a ZnCo2S4@NiFe-LDH core–shell nanowire array on a porous nickel foam as an efficient HER catalyst in alkaline solution.155 The increasing number of active sites due to the introduction of LDH and the synergistic effect between ZnCo2S4 and LDH were responsible for the excellent HER activity. Ma et al. found that spinel-structured CuCo2S4/NiCo2S4 core–shell catalysts were effective for both the HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH.156 Spinel compounds, compared with oxides and sulfides, exhibited advantages of high electrical conductivity, low electronegativity, and rich redox properties, making them very promising for water splitting. Meanwhile, Huang et al. developed N-, O-, and S-tridoped carbon-encapsulated Co9S8 nanocomposites as bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting in an alkaline medium.157 The excellent OER activity was ascribed to the synergistic effects between the heteroatom-doped carbon layers and the Co9S8 cores. Similarly, N,S-co-doped porous carbon-coated CoxSy and N,O,S-doped carbon encapsulated Ni3S2/NiS also afforded superior OER and HER performance.158,159 In addition, Xing et al. hydrothermally grew MoS2 on carbon cloth and then electrodeposited Ni to obtain an MoS2@Ni core–shell nanosheet array, which exhibited excellent HER activity in alkaline and neutral solutions due to the synergetic effects between the core and shell.160


4.4.2 Transition-metal selenides. 
Metal selenides, such as CoSe2 and NiSe, have manifested excellent HER and OER activity over a wide pH range.161–164 As evidenced, the formation of (hydr)oxide shells out of the selenide would promote OER performance. Zou and co-workers found that in situ oxidizing NiSe to form an amorphous NiOx surface under electrocatalytic conditions resulted in NiSe/NiOx core–shell catalysts towards efficient OER.165 It was suggested that the NiOx shell acted as the main active sites while the NiSe core played a secondary role. The similar case of core–shell NiSe@NiOOH identified that the amorphous NiOOH provided the OER active sites, and the synergistic effect between NiSe and NiOOH benefitted efficient OER.166 Yang et al. decorated Co,Ni-based layered double hydroxides (CoNi-LDHs) on CoNiSe2 nanorods to boost the kinetics of the alkaline HER.167 The thin CoNi-LDH layers were active for water dissociation that produced H* on neighboring CoNiSe2 sites for subsequent H2 evolution, leading to excellent HER activity in 1.0 M KOH (η10 = 106 mV). By contrast, such an effect was negligible in the OER owing to the different reaction pathways. Moreover, the core–shell composite further afforded superior activity for overall water splitting with a quite low cell voltage of 1.44 V at −10 mA cm−2, outperforming most noble-metal-free materials, and even a benchmark IrO2/C–Pt/C couple.
Conductive polymers could also be introduced as the shell to improve selenide-based electrocatalysts. For example, Xu et al. prepared a V2Se9@poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) nanosheet array on nickel foam (denoted V2Se9@PEDOT NSs/NF) with a highly exposed V2Se9(100) facet (Fig. 16a).168 The electronic interactions between V2Se9 and PEDOT were evidenced by the XPS profile of S with a positive shift (Fig. 16b), which was beneficial for the synergetic effect between the core and shell to accelerate the HER kinetics. The vertically growing nanosheet array on nickel foam also benefited the exposure of abundant active sites and fast electron transport. Thereby, V2Se9@PEDOT NSs/NF delivered a low η10 of only 72 mV (Fig. 16c), and the voltage change was negligible during a 25 h stability test. DFT calculation results (Fig. 16d) showed that the ΔGH* of V2Se9@PEDOT NSs/NF (0.09 eV) approached that of Pt (around 0.09 eV).

Table 5 summarizes the HER and OER performances of representative core–shell materials with TMDs as cores. Oxides, bimetallic sulfides and even polymers can be used to construct core–shell structured catalysts with TMDs, aiming to improve the catalytic activity and stability of TMDs. Meanwhile, TMDs@TMDs core–shell nanostructures (e.g., Co9S8/MoS2) were introduced as an ideal model to investigate the strain effects of MoS2 in electrocatalysis. The interactions with cores bent the MoS2 nanolayers with diverse strains depending on the number of layers, which gave a clear correlation between strain and HER activity.

4.5 TMCs as cores

4.5.1 MoxC. 
Since Hu and co-workers discovered the good HER activity of commercial Mo2C in both acid and alkaline solution in 2012,169 TMCs have received widespread research interest.14 As a representative, molybdenum carbides (MoCx) have been extensively investigated.170 Although the electronic structure of Mo in MoCx is similar to that of Pt, the intrinsic activity is still limited since the Mo–H bond is too strong. Appropriate electronic regulation can reduce the strength of Mo–H, and thus allow for easy H* desorption to generate gaseous H2. Building a core–shell structure affords an opportunity to tailor the surface state, as well as to prevent active TMC cores from oxidation or agglomeration. Through a MOF-oriented strategy, Tang and co-workers successfully developed a graphite shell (GS) encapsulated MoC (nanoMoC@GS) towards efficient HER.171 NanoMoC@GS consisted of ultrafine MoC crystals (∼3 nm) and 1–3 layers of ultrathin porous graphite shells (Fig. 17a). The shell not only prevented agglomeration of MoC particles, but also provided enhanced electrical conductivity and rich porosity. NanoMoC@GS exhibited excellent HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH with η10 of 124 mV and 77 mV, and a small Tafel slope of 43 and 50 mV dec−1, respectively. Under the protection of GS, the composite expressed remarkable stability with negligible change after 3000 cycles (Fig. 17b).

Doping with N and P also provided a large number of highly active sites in the C shell to further improve the electrocatalysis. Liu et al. successfully synthesized an HER catalyst with ultrafine Mo2C embedded in nitrogen-rich carbon (Mo2C@NC) through a facile one-step route (Fig. 17c).24 With its ultrafine particles and uniform distribution (Fig. 17d), Mo2C@NC exposed more active sites. It delivered superior HER activity in acidic, neutral and alkaline solution, with η10 of 124, 156 and 60 mV at pH = 0, 7 and 14, respectively. DFT calculations indicated that the ΔGH* of Mo2C@C was smaller than that of Mo2C, and doping by N further moved the ΔGH* of Mo2C@NC close to zero (Fig. 17e). This indicated that Mo2C and N synergistically co-activated adjacent C atoms, in which Mo2C acted as an electron donor and N acted as an electron acceptor, making the C atoms between them the best HER active sites. Analogously, Li and co-workers demonstrated that MoCx@C-1 with an N-doped core–shell showed efficient HER performance, featuring an ultralow η10 value of 79 mV in acidic media.172 Li et al. designed a 2D coupled hybrid consisting of Mo2C encapsulated in N,P-doped carbon shells and N,P-doped reduced graphene oxide for efficient HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 (η10 = 34 mV).173 The visible N-doping into the carbon matrix can be ascribed mainly to the pyridinic-N, and it was theoretically identified as a substantial active site when it was anchored to the surface of Mo2C. Moreover, co-doping with two elements was employed to further optimize the sites on carbon shells. Chen et al. developed pomegranate-like N,P-doped Mo2C@C nanospheres as alkaline HER catalysts in which N and P atoms were doped into Mo2C and C shells.174 Zhang et al. found that ultrafine MoCx materials encapsulated in N,S co-doped graphene exhibited superior HER performance at all pH values.175


4.5.2 WxC and other TMCs. 
Tungsten carbides (WC, W2C, WC1−x, etc.) have also attracted research interest as promising HER electrocatalysts,176,177 thanks to the electron density of tungsten carbides being close to that of platinum.178,179 Zhang et al. not only synthesized MoCx/C but also replaced the molybdenum precursor with a tungsten precursor to fabricate N,S-co-doped graphene encapsulated ultrafine WCx which was efficient for the HER over a wide pH range.175 Tungsten carbides are unstable in neutral and alkaline solutions, but, with a carbon shell, they also exhibited superior HER activity. Han et al. showed that a catalyst of WC nanocrystals wrapped in nitrogen-doped carbon exhibited excellent HER performance and long-term durability in acidic and alkaline solutions.180 Feng et al. proved by DFT calculation that there was a strong electronic synergy effect between WC and N-doped carbon, accounting for the increased HER activity.181 Yan et al. constructed a P-W2C@NC core–shell catalyst with N-doping in carbon and P-doping in W2C.182 It exhibited remarkable HER activity in acidic, alkaline and neutral solutions with η10 of 89, 63 and 185 mV, respectively. Thanks to the protection of the carbon shell, P-W2C@NC afforded long-term stability under alkaline and neutral conditions.
Carbon coating as an inborn shell is also available to boost other TMC electrocatalysts. Wei and his group proved that Ni-doped VC nanoboscages encapsulated in carbon possessed high HER efficiency under both acidic and alkaline conditions.183 Guo and co-workers developed a hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HF-CVD) strategy to fabricate vertically aligned graphene nanoribbon (GNR) supported metal carbides (M3C, M = Fe, Co, Ni) as bifunctional ORR and HER catalysts.184 The uniformly dispersed ultrafine M3C nanoparticles with several carbon layers wrapped around them exposed more active sites and made good contact with GNRs. The excellent conductivity of the GNR carriers also contributed to the charge transfer of hybrid materials. Owing to the merits mentioned above, the Fe3C-GNRs, Co3C-GNRs, and Ni3C-GNRs afforded high current densities of 166.6, 79.6, and 116.4 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 200 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, and exhibited small Tafel slopes of 46, 57, and 54 mV dec−1, respectively. Moreover, Jiang et al. identified that the activation of Fe3C on the graphene shell and nitrogen-containing active sites was beneficial for the synergistic effect between the Fe3C core and the NG shell.185 Zhang et al. found that Fe3C nanorods encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes (Fe3C@NCNT) exhibited excellent HER activity under both alkaline and acidic conditions.186 The synergistic effect between Fe3C and NCNT could effectively adjust the adsorption energy of H* on carbon and thus enhance the HER activity.

Table 6 summarizes the HER and OER performance of representative core–shell electrocatalysts with TMCs as cores. The preparation of TMCs via pyrolyzing carbon-containing precursors at extremely high temperatures produces carbon deposition as a by-product, mostly in the form of carbon shells on the TMC surface. Such shells not only prevent the aggregation of carbides in high-temperature synthesis, but also afford interfacial interactions to boost electrocatalytic performance. Similar to the case of TMs@C, electronic modulation by doping into carbon shells is available for intrisically boosting the electrocatalytic activity of TMCs.

In a short summary of the above-mentioned noble-metal-free electrocatalysts, core–shell nanostructures are feasible for improving activity and stability for water splitting. A large variety of components, including TMs, TM(H)Os, TMPs, TMDs, and TMCs, have been introduced as effective cores or shells, which highlights the promise of core–shell engineering towards various high-performance electrocatalysts. However, the electrocatalytic performance evidently shows a dependence on synthetic methods or processes, indicating a great challenge in the control over core–shell interfaces. Although the thickness of 2D TMDs and carbon shell can be regulated to some extent,18 the regulation of other components, e.g., interstitial TMCs and TMPs without 2D crystals, is still difficult. In this regard, innovation in catalyst preparation is demanded. Moreover, insights into the working mechanism of such core–shell nanostructures free from noble-metals is still desired, because of the structural complexity on un-defined interfaces.

5. Conclusion and outlook
In this review, we have summarized the recent progress of core–shell nanostructures used for the HER, OER and overall water splitting, which are highlighted as cost-efficient electrocatalysts free from or with few noble-metals. As for noble-metal-based core–shell nanostructures, the emphasis is on ultrathin noble-metal shells with non-precious cores, which can obviously reduce the use of noble elements, but more importantly produce higher activity and better stability due to strong interactions and available synergy arising from the cores. It should be pointed out that a comparison of core–shell and core–shell-free electrocatalysts from different references is not appropriate, because testing parameters (e.g., electrolytes, mass loading, potential range, or scanning rate) are quite different. A careful comparison at the same test level, being conducted on core–shell and core–shell-free (e.g., solid particles) electrocatalysts with the same active components, should be made to illustrate the structural advantages of core–shell nanostructures. And the specific current with respect to noble-metal loading is an important criterion, especially from a cost-efficiency viewpoint. Evidently, the metal-based mass specific activity for OER of Ir and Ru based core–shell structures is higher than that of their nanoparticle counterparts,49,51 which enables them to be the only cost-efficient candidate available under acidic conditions.
Meanwhile, a large variety of core–shell nanostructures without noble-metals have been introduced for water electrolysis. Rational engineering on core and shell structures is important to expose surface/interfacial active sites, to modify electronic interactions between cores and shells, to fulfill interfacial synergic enhancement, and to reinforce long-term durability in corrosive electrolytes under the protection of robust shells. A classification based on core components (e.g., TMs, TM(H)Os, TMPs, TMDs and TMCs) was used to comprehensively discuss relevant progress. Some of them, after structural engineering, achieved comparable activity and higher stability in comparison with noble-metals. In addition, the booming development of noble-metal-free electrocatalysts provides new insights into the electrocatalytic mechanism, owing to the unique intermediate bindings and reaction pathways which are quite different from those of the extensively studied noble-metals.
It should be pointed out that the relevant research on core–shell electrocatalysts is in its early stages. Their electrocatalytic performance (activity and stability) still needs further improvement towards practical applications, and the catalytic mechanisms are controversial because most interpretations are based on the classic theory for noble-metal monocrystal facets. For the further development of such electrocatalysts, there are still four main challenges.
Firstly, special attention should be paid to the reconstruction of core–shell electrocatalysts under working conditions. The as-synthesized core–shell nanostructures experience obvious surface alteration during electrocatalysis, affording new-born active-sites different from the pre-designed shells. For example, core–shell nanostructured Fe3O4@NixP was evolved in situ to oxidized particles with good OER activity, in which the Fe3O4 core helped to activate the electrochemical processes of Ni (Ni3+ → Ni4+) and to enhance the activity.118 Very recently, He et al. demonstrated the in situ reduction of surface MoOx on Mo2C to MoO2 during the HER in HClO4, resulting in obviously enhanced HER activity on Mo2C–MoO2 interfaces.189 As suggested, the Mo atoms on Mo2C adjacent to an MoO moiety were the real active-sites under working conditions. Therefore, electrochemical in situ technologies (e.g., Raman, FT-IR, or XAS) are highly desirable to uncover the reconstruction of core–shell interfaces during electrolysis with applied potentials,190 which is of great importance to access the working state and mechanism of actives-sites.
Secondly, a universal strategy to precisely control the shell is highly desirable to improve the performance on core–shell electrocatalysts, because a suitable shell thickness can synchronously improve the exposure of interfacial active-sites and interactions between cores and shells. Previous research has successfully achieved ultrathin shells of MoS2 and graphene;23,151 however, the method is limited to 2D nanomaterials. It is challenging to engineer the shells of other materials without 2D crystal structures. Atomic layer deposition, as a thin-film deposition technique based on the sequential use of a gas phase chemical process, may be a good choice.191 But efforts are still needed to extend the variety of metals, to miniaturize the equipment, to simplify the procedure and to reduce the cost.
Thirdly, the application of core–shell electrocatalysts in seawater electrolysis should be explored. For most electrolytes currently used to test the performance of electrocatalysts are strong acids or bases. However, for future large-scale applications, the electrolyte must be economical and easily available. Seawater with large reserves and a high ion concentration is a better choice. However, chlorine gas evolution at the anode competes with the OER.192 Therefore, the realization of electrolyzed seawater requires powerful and effective electrocatalysts, which can maintain seawater splitting without being corroded by chlorides or poisoned by insoluble precipitates on the electrode surface.193 Owing to their structural advantages, core–shell electrocatalysts free from noble-metals are expected to be promising candidates. For example, Ni@NiO and NiMoN@NiFeN electrocatalysts have proved their prominent HER and OER performances in natural seawater.194,195 Rational engineering of core–shell nanostructures and interfacial interactions is expected to further promote their efficiency and stability in complex seawater environments.
Finally, mechanistic insights into core–shell electrocatalysts are anticipated to boost other electrocatalytic applications, such as the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), the N2 reduction reaction (NRR), and electrocatalytic hydrogenation/oxidation (ECH/ECO). In particular, the above reactions usually proceed in an aqueous solution, and therefore the HER and OER are common side-reactions. Insights into the HER and OER mechanism will encourage the reverse design of an electrocatalyst which is unfavorable for the HER or OER, to improve the Faradaic efficiency of the CO2RR, NRR and ECH/ECO. Meanwhile, H* and OH* are usually the intermediates involved in such reactions: e.g., H* is the reductant for ECH.196 Thereby, an established strategy to regulate H* and OH* on the core–shell surface will give hints for the exploration of cost-efficient electrocatalysts for various applications.
