    , Accepted 21st March 2014First published on 27th March 2014AbstractDicyanovinyl (DCV) end-capped oligomers 1–7 containing fused benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (NDT) as central cores have been synthesized and characterized. These oligomers show excellent thermal stability due to the insertion of the central fused ring system thus allowing purification by gradient sublimation in high yield. With respect to the reference compound, non-fused tetramer DCV4T, the new oligomers showed hypsochromic shifts in absorption and emission spectra and larger band gaps in thin films. Due to high lying LUMO energy levels, they exhibit sufficient energy offset with respect to C60 to allow for efficient charge transfer in organic solar cells. At the same time, low-lying HOMO energy levels result in high open-circuit voltages (VOC). As a result, planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells derived from the novel oligomers and C60 provide very high open circuit voltages (VOC) of up to 1.21 V and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 2.7%. Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices comprising oligomers 1–4 and C60 display a slightly lower VOC of 1 V leading to efficiencies as high as 3.6%.
Introduction
Over the last few years, great progress has been made for organic solar cells (OSC) based on structurally defined π-conjugated oligomers, typically referred to as “small molecules”, as electron donors and fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors.1–3 The “driving force” for this rapid development comes from the versatile design of appropriate p-type semiconducting oligomers and optimization of device fabrication conditions in planar-heterojunction (PHJ) and bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) architectures. High power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 8–9% (ref. 4–6) and 10.1% (ref. 7) have very recently been achieved for solution-processed oligomer BHJ single junction cells and the first oligomer/oligomer tandem cell, respectively. Triple cells containing evaporated oligomers reached record efficiencies of 12.0% at the beginning of last year.8 Structurally defined oligomers comprise several inherent advantages compared to conjugated polymers, such as involving straightforward synthesis and purification processes leading to well-defined molecular structures with defined molecular weight. Thus, they can be prepared with high purity and reproducibility.9
Further development of new π-conjugated molecules is therefore of considerable interest in order to provide specially tuned materials with appropriate physical properties. In this context, special attention has recently been paid on planar molecules comprising fused ring systems. Such molecules combine excellent charge carrier mobilities in organic field-effect transistors (OFET) and high thermal stability at the same time.10–12 Among them, benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (NDT) represent promising fused thiophene-based systems, which were included in various copolymers and tested as donor materials in OSCs.13–19 It has been shown that in these systems annulation lowers the HOMO energy level of the polymer, thus an improvement of air stability and higher open circuit voltages (VOC) in OSCs were shown. Müllen et al. recently reported that BDT-containing polythiophenes had low-lying HOMO energy levels and favorable aggregation behavior resulting in higher field-effect mobilities in comparison to the polythiophene counterpart.20,21 OSCs of the BDT-polymer in combination with soluble fullerene derivative PC71BM as the acceptor gave a PCE of 2.7%.13
To date, only one example of a BDT-containing π-conjugated oligomer is reported. In comparison to the corresponding bithiophene analogue introduction of fused rings resulted in a hypsochromic shift of the longest wavelength absorption and a lowering of the HOMO energy level which was attributed to the reduction of the effective conjugation length because of the bent structure of the BDT unit.22 Herein, we now present a series of tetramers incorporating the BDT and NDT unit as a core motif. We further studied the influence of the molecular rigidity on optoelectronic properties and energy levels of the frontier orbitals and compared the data to quaterthiophene derivative DCV4T as a reference which was reported previously23 (Chart 1). Additionally, the influence of different side chains and the replacement of the terminal thiophenes by furans were investigated. Finally, a correlation of the structural features and resulting properties with the solar cell performance was set up in order to gain further insight into molecular structure–device performance relationships.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of BDT-based and NDT-based oligomers
Benzodithiophene containing oligomers 1–4 were synthesized in 81% to 90% yield by Pd0-catalyzed Stille-type cross-coupling of DCV-capped terminal building blocks 10,2412, 13,2515, and distannylated benzodithiophene BDT 9 (Scheme 1). 2-[(5-Bromo-4-butylthien-2-yl)methylene]malononitrile 12 was synthesized in 90% yield by a Knoevenagel condensation of 5-bromo-4-butylthiophene-2-carbaldehyde 11 (ref. 26) and malononitrile in the presence of β-alanine as the catalyst. 2-[(5-Bromofur-2-yl)methylene]malononitrile 15 was synthesized in 65% yield by a Knoevenagel reaction of 5-bromofuran-2-carbaldehyde 14 and malononitrile using a catalytic amount of piperidine as a base. Distannylation of BDT 8 (ref. 27) was carried out by lithiation using n-butyl lithium and subsequent quenching with trimethyltin chloride in 94% yield.

Oligomers 5–7 were synthesized by Pd0-catalyzed Stille-type cross-coupling reaction of bromo-derivative 10 with distannylated central units 22, 26, and 30 in yield between 83% and 96%. Synthesis of stannyl derivative 22 (Scheme 2) started with 3,3′-dibromo-5,5′-bistrimethylsilyl-2,2′-bithiophene 19, which was synthesized as described in the literature.28 Firstly, diacetyl 20 was synthesized in 60% yield by lithiation of bithiophene 19 using n-BuLi followed by quenching with N-methoxy-N-methylacetamide2918. The second step was an intramolecular McMurry reaction using TiCl4 and elementary zinc followed by deprotection of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) groups using tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride trihydrate (TBAF) to afford 4,5-dimethylbenzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene 21 in a yield of 66% (for two steps). Finally, bithiophene 21 was reacted with n-BuLi and trimethyltin chloride to give stannyl derivative 22 in 88% yield.

Benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-4,5-dione 23 was readily synthesized as described in the literature.30 In the first step, twofold esterification of 23 to acetylated derivative 24 was achieved in 67% yield by reaction with acetic anhydride, zinc, and triethylamine. This reaction was carried out according to the synthesis of benzo[1,2-b:4,3-b′]dithiophene-4,5-diyldiacetate as described in the literature.31 Then, a twofold etherification with cesium carbonate and methyl iodide afforded dimethoxy-BDT 25 in 86% yield. Stannylation of 25 with n-BuLi and trimethyltin chloride gave bis-stannylated 26 in 90% yield (Scheme 3).

Synthesis of naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]bithiophene and its derivatives is described in the literature. The fused ring system was on one hand synthesized via a palladium-catalyzed coupling of 3,3′-diiodo-2,2′-bithiophene and an alkyne14 or via oxidative cyclization on the other hand.32,33 We developed a new synthesis route, which includes a twofold Stille cross-coupling reaction of [3,3'-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2'-bithien-5,5'-diyl]-bis(trimethylsilane) and 1,2-dibromobenzene 28 (Scheme 4). Stannyl derivative 27 was obtained in a yield of 88% by quenching the lithiated species of bithiophene 19 with trimethyltin chloride. The Stille reaction of 27 with 1,2-dibromobenzene 28 and in situ deprotection of the trimethylsilyl groups gave 29 in 53% yield (for two steps) which was stannylated using n-BuLi and trimethylstannyl chloride to obtain NDT-derivative 30 in a yield of 94%.

Thermal properties
Thermal stability of optoelectronic materials is of paramount importance for the construction of organic solar cells when prepared by vacuum-deposition techniques at higher temperatures. Therefore, we investigated melting points and decomposition temperatures of the BDT- and NDT-based target molecules 1–7 by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) under an inert atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. 1, Table 1). BDTs 1–6 melted between 311 °C and 458 °C and do not decompose below 380 °C. NDT 7 showed an even higher melting temperature of 473 °C with a decomposition temperature of 480 °C. The excellent thermal stability of oligomers 1–7 was confirmed by TGA measurements, also showing decomposition temperatures (Td) with 5% weight loss above 380 °C.

The melting temperature (Tm) of oligomer 1 is 30 °C higher than that of DCV4T pointing to stronger intermolecular interactions due to the planarization of the BDT unit. The furan containing oligomer 4 showed a 36 °C higher melting point further supporting the higher intermolecular interactions of furan-containing oligomers compared to oligothiophenes.34 Butyl side chains decreased the melting temperature and compound 2 melted at 311 °C which is 39 °C lower than that of BDT 1. Oligomer 3 did not show any phase transition before decomposition. The substituents at the ethylene bridge of the BDT unit of oligomers 5–7 resulted in an increase of the melting temperature (Fig. S1†). BDT 5–7 showed a strong exothermic peak immediately after melting. The planar NDT containing oligomer 7 showed the highest melting temperature of 473 °C. The compounds were purified by gradient vacuum sublimation.
Optical spectroscopy
The optical properties of the BDT-based oligomers 1–7 were determined by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy in dichloromethane and in thin films prepared by vacuum sublimation. All data are summarized in Table 2. Representative solution and thin film spectra are shown in Fig. 2 and S2.†

 Fig. 2  (a) Representative absorption and fluorescence spectra of benzodithiophene 1, 3, and 4 in dichloromethane at room temperature. (b) Thin film (30 nm) absorbance and fluorescence spectra of benzodithiophene 1, 3, and 4. Thin films were prepared by vacuum sublimation. The absorption and emission spectra of DCV4T are included for comparison. 
In solution, BDT containing oligomers 1–6 showed an absorption maximum between 484 nm and 497 nm. Each corresponds to the π–π* (HOMO–LUMO) transition of the conjugated π-system. The absorption bands of oligomers 1–6 are hypsochromically shifted compared to DCV4T due to lowering of the HOMO energy level as a consequence of the fused BDT unit. In contrast to DCV4T, BDT-oligomer 1 showed a strong alternation of the absorption band with two distinct vibronic transitions appearing at 489 nm and 506 nm. The emission maximum of 1 is about 42 nm blue-shifted in comparison to DCV4T showing its maximum at 565 nm. Similar vibronic splitting of the absorption and emission bands was also observed for the furan-containing oligomer 4. The smaller Stokes shift for 4 compared to 1 can be assigned to the higher rigidity of the oligofurans in comparison to that of oligothiophenes.34
The absorption and fluorescence spectra of butyl- and methyl-substituted oligomers 2 and 3 displayed structureless bands due to the presence of alkyl side chains. The Stokes shift of these two oligomers is larger compared to that of 1, 4, and DCV4T, which is an indication for a higher twist between the alkylated thiophenes and the BDT unit.
In comparison to oligomer 1, the insertion of electron donating methyl and methoxy groups at the BDT units in 5 and 6 showed only a small influence on the absorption behaviour. On the other hand, the emission maxima of oligomers 5 and 6 are 50 nm and 23 nm red-shifted compared to 1 resulting in a larger Stokes shift of 3982 cm−1 and 2373 cm−1, respectively. The larger Stokes shift further confirms the steric hinderance in oligomers 5 and 6 indicating a significant structural reorganization on photoexcitation.
The molar extinction coefficient of 1 was about 7700 L mol−1 cm−1 higher than that of the parent DCV4T, while due to molecular flexibility the molar extinction coefficient is reduced for oligomer 2. The molar extinction coefficient of oligomers 3–7 could not be determined due to their poor solubility.
NDT-containing oligomer 7 showed a bathochromic shift of the absorption band in comparison to BDT 1–6 due to the higher electron-donating strength of the NDT unit. The absorption maximum of 7 was located at 512 nm with a shoulder at around 537 nm. The emission maximum of 7 was strongly red-shifted by Δλ = 40 nm compared to 1 resulting in a slightly larger Stoke shift of 2093 cm−1.
In solution the optical energy gap of oligomers 1–6 is found to be slightly larger (2.17–2.26 eV) compared to 2.09 eV for DCV4T. While, NDT 7 showed a very similar energy gap of 2.12 eV compared to DCV4T.
Thin film absorption and emission spectra of BDTs 1–7 are significantly broadened and bathochromically shifted compared to the solution spectra (Fig. 2 and S2†). This red-shift and spectral broadening in thin films suggest higher planarity of the molecules in films which induces a higher ordering and an increase of the intermolecular interactions. The absorption maxima of BDT oligomers 1–6 are localized between 505 nm and 529 nm and the emission maxima between 675 nm and 735 nm. The absorption maximum of NDT 7 is further red-shifted to 549 nm and the emission maximum to 766 nm. The optical band gaps in thin films are lowered by about 0.3 eV compared to the gaps obtained from solution spectra.
Cyclic voltammetry
The redox properties of oligomers 1–4 have been measured in 0.1 M tetrachloroethane–TBAPF6 at 80 °C. All data are summarized in Table 3 and the DPV of oligomer 1 is shown as an example in Fig. 3. Oligomer 1 showed two reversible one-electron oxidation waves at 0.99 V and 1.33 V indicating the formation of stable radical cations and dications, respectively. One quasi-reversible reduction wave was observed at −1.41 V which is assigned to the reduction of the DCV end groups. As a consequence of the fused BDT unit, the oxidation potentials of oligomer 1 are shifted to slightly higher potentials (ΔEox = 0.15 V and 0.13 V) compared to DCV4T whereas no change was observed for the reduction potential. The oxidation potentials of oligomer 2 are very similar to that of 1. Oligomer 3 containing four methyl groups showed slightly lower oxidation potentials (ΔEox = 0.05 V and ∼0.14 V) compared to 1 and 2. In contrast, furan-containing oligomer 4 did not show a reversible oxidation behavior and the waves were shifted to lower potentials of 0.85 V and 1.17 V. Similar behavior is also reported for oligofurans.34

 Fig. 3  Representative DPV of benzodithiophene-containing oligomer 1 measured in TCE–TBAPF6 (0.1 M), c ≈ 1 × 10−3 mol L−1, 80 °C, scan rate = 100 mV s−1. 
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of oligomers 1–4 were calculated from the onset values of the first oxidation and reduction wave using the standard approximation that the Fc/Fc+ HOMO energy level is −5.1 eV versus vacuum.35 The results are presented in Fig. 4 and the data are compiled in Table 3. The HOMO and LUMO levels of compounds 1 and 2 are identical showing an electrochemical band gap of 2.19 eV. The LUMO energy level of oligomer 3 is similar to 1 and 2 but showed a slightly higher HOMO level, which, resulted in a lower electrochemical band gap of 2.09 eV. Compound 4 comprising furan units showed HOMO and LUMO energy values which are about 0.2 eV higher than that of 1, thus an identical electrochemical band gap of 2.19 eV. The redox properties of oligomers 5–7 could not be determined due to their low solubility. As can be seen in Fig. 5 the low lying HOMO energy levels of these oligomers could be favorable for obtaining higher VOC in organic solar cells using C60 as an acceptor. It is known that the VOC depends on the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor.
 Fig. 4  Representation of HOMO/LUMO energies of oligomers 1–4 and DCV4T derived from electrochemical data compared to C60. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of C60 are taken from the literature36 and were determined from the onset of the first oxidation and reduction waves measured in 0.1 M TBAPF6–tetrachloroethane. 
 Fig. 5  General device architecture of investigated PHJ solar cells. 
Preparation and characterization of vacuum-processed solar cells
The DCV end-capped oligomers 1–4 were tested as electron donor materials in PHJ and BHJ solar cells using fullerene C60 as an electron acceptor. The cells were prepared by vacuum sublimation following the m-i-p concept reported in the literature.37,38
Planar heterojunction solar cells
Planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells consist of a well-defined planar interface between the donor and the acceptor layer. Consequently, the efficiency is not limited by charge carrier transport, but rather by the exciton diffusion length. The stack of the PHJ solar cells consisted of 15 nm C60 evaporated on an ITO-coated glass substrate, followed by deposition of a 6 nm donor layer of the respective oligomers 1–4, 5 nm of undoped and 50 nm of p-doped 9,9-bis{4-[di-(p-biphenyl)aminophenyl]}fluorene (BPAPF) as a hole transport layer (HTL). The undoped BPAPF layer was introduced to avoid direct contact between the active layer and the p-doped BPAPF layer which otherwise could lead to quenching of excitons by the dopants.39 As a p-dopant, NDP9 (10 wt%) was used. Another 1 nm thick layer of NDP9 was introduced between the HTL and the Au top contact to facilitate charge extraction (Fig. 5).
The PHJ solar cell parameters are summarized in Table 4. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PHJ-devices are shown in Fig. 6. Oligomer 1 gave a PCE of 2.3%, with a short circuit current density (JSC) of 4.7 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.09 V, and a FF of 44%. The HOMO energy levels of oligomers 1–3 are reduced by 0.04 to 0.15 eV compared to DCV4T. In PHJ cells, VOC scales linearly with the energy difference of the LUMO of the acceptor (C60) and the HOMO of the donor.40 Consequently, a very high VOC of up to 1.21 V was obtained for oligomer 2, which is one of the highest values ever reported for PHJ devices.41,42 The higher VOC value of 2 was consistent with its deeper low-lying HOMO energy level. On the other hand, the J–V-characteristics of the 2-based device generated an s-kink due to an energetic barrier at the interface to the HTL resulting in a low FF of 37% and an efficiency of 1.5%. Even though, the HOMO energy level of oligomer 1 is the lowest among all oligomers, it yields only a VOC of 1.09 V. This could be explained by the formation of pinholes in 6 nm thin films of the oligomer leading to some close contact between the C60 acceptor and BPAPF hole transporter, thus, making a direct contact between the cathode and anode. Friend and co-workers reported that these direct paths act as a shunt resistance in parallel with the active layer of the device, resulting in the lowering of VOC.43 Oligomers 3 and 4 showed VOC values of 1.07 V and 0.97 V which correspond well to the energetic shift of the HOMO energy level with respect to the C60 acceptor. Furthermore, oligomers 3 and 4 based devices reached FF values of 44% and 59%, JSCs of 4.3 mA cm−2 and 3.4 mA cm−2 and PCEs of 2.0 and 1.9%, respectively. The EQE spectrum of 4 is significantly shifted to lower wavelengths corroborated well with the thin film absorption spectrum (Fig. 6b).

 Fig. 6  (a) J–V-characteristics of planar heterojunction solar cells with DCV end-capped oligomers 1–4 and DCV4T as the donor material and C60 as an acceptor. (b) Corresponding EQE spectra of PHJ solar cells. 
PHJ solar cells prepared with oligomers 5 and 6 containing methyl and methoxy-substituents at the BDT unit achieved PCEs of 1.5% and 2.7%, respectively (Fig. S3†). The lower performance of 5 compared to 1 is due to the reduction in JSC, VOC, and FF values. However, the efficiency of oligomer 6 is very promising. In comparison to oligomer 1, higher JSC and VOC values of 5.2 mA cm−2 and 1.15 V have been measured.
The perpendicular extension of the ring fusion in NDT-containing oligomer 7 led to a higher FF of 49% compared to 44% for BDT 1. The J–V characteristics of NDT 7 showed a poor rectifying behavior in the dark, which is a hint for a poor film quality. A significantly lower VOC of 0.90 V was measured for NDT 7. This could be explained by a poor packing of NDT 7 in thin layers resulting in pinholes, which could lead to some close contact between the C60 and BPAPF hole transporter and thus reduces the VOC. Together with a JSC of 4.0 mA cm−2 the device generated a PCE of 1.8%.
In PHJ devices, reference compound DCV4T displayed the highest performance among all oligomers. Oligomers 1–7 exhibited significantly lower JSC compared to DCV4T which was also reflected in their EQE spectra. The DCV4T device generated a PCE of 3.0% with a VOC of 1.0 V and a higher JSC of 6.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 48%. The saturation values for all compounds are in the range of 1.2 to 1.4. A saturation value close to unity, i.e., weak voltage bias dependence of the current in the reverse direction, is an indication for an efficient charge separation and extraction. Larger values indicate that recombination losses and field-dependent dissociation of charge-carriers are present.44,45
Bulk heterojunction solar cells
BHJ solar cells with a photoactive layer thickness of 20 nm were prepared using oligomers 1–4 as the donor and C60 as an acceptor. The blend layer was prepared by co-evaporation of the donor and the acceptor in a ratio of 1:1 by volume at a substrate temperature of 70 °C. This substrate temperature was found to be optimal for quaterthiophene-based materials.25 It has been shown that heating of the substrate should result in a morphology, which provides better charge transport in the active layer.39,46 All other layers were vacuum-deposited using the following layer sequence: ITO-coated glass substrate, 15 nm C60, 20 nm photoactive blend layer, 5 nm of undoped and 50 nm of p-doped 9,9-bis[4-(N,N-bis-biphenyl-4-ylamino)phenyl]-9H-fluorene (BPAPF) as the hole transport layer (HTL), 1 nm thick NDP9 layer and the Au top electrode (Fig. 7). The data for the BHJ solar cells are summarized in Table 5 and J–V characteristics as well as EQE spectra of the solar cells are shown in Fig. 8.

 Fig. 8  (a) Representative J–V-characteristics of bulk-heterojunction solar cells with DCV end-capped benzodithiophene 1 and DCV4T as donor materials. (b) Corresponding EQE spectra of BHJ solar cells. 
All BDT-containing oligomers gave high VOCs close to 1 V. This was expected, since in BHJ solar cells the VOC is dominated by the LUMO of the acceptor (C60) and the HOMO of the HTL (BPAPF).40 BHJ solar cells with oligomers 1–4 reached JSCs of 4.0 to 6.0 mA cm−2. Comparing the JSC achieved with all donor materials, the BHJ cells followed the same trend as the PHJ solar cells. The development of the photocurrents correlates well with the EQE-spectra. Oligomers 1–3 showed qualitatively similar spectra with a maximum at around 550 nm. The EQE spectrum of 4 is slightly blue-shifted and corresponds well to the PHJ device and the thin film absorption spectra. The FF besides efficiency is one of the most critical parameter in organic solar cells. Interestingly, the BHJ devices with BDT derivatives 1–4 exhibited higher FFs (52% to 61%), which are significantly higher compared to devices of reference DCV4T (46%). This suggests that the molecular planarization in BDTs resulted in an improved charge carrier transport in the donor–acceptor blend layers. Consequently, BHJ cells prepared with BDTs 1–4 showed good efficiencies of 3.6%, 2.1%, 3.2%, and 2.8%. Additionally, the significantly lower saturation values of 1.12 to 1.18 for the BDT-based BHJ cells compared to DCV4T (1.24) indicate a decrease of field-dependent recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. It is interesting to note that the best cell in this series incorporating planar BDT-oligomer 1 gave a 12.5% improvement in efficiency compared to reference DCV4T (Table 5).
Oligomers 5 and 7 were not tested in BHJSCs due to their low efficiencies in PHJ devices and high degree of decomposition during sublimation. The BHJ device prepared with oligomer 6 gave a JSC of 5.4 mA cm−2, a FF of 50%, and an efficiency of 2.6%. The lower performance of 6 is mainly ascribed to the moderate fill factor.
Conclusions
We have synthesized and characterized a series of novel benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (BDT)- and naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (NDT)-containing oligomers for applications in organic solar cells. Gradient vacuum sublimation led to pure organic semiconducting materials with high thermal stability. Incorporation of the fused central BDT and NDT units resulted in blue-shifted absorption and emission spectra and in an increase of the band gap compared to non-fused reference DCV4T. PHJ and BHJ solar cells were fabricated by vacuum-processing using these oligomers as the electron donor and C60 as the electron acceptor. PHJ solar cells constructed using all oligomers displayed high VOCs and efficiencies in the range of 1.5–3.0% under full sun illumination. Despite a blue-shifted absorption and a larger band gap, the highest PCE of 3.6% was obtained in BHJ devices for BDT-oligomer 1 which is higher compared to reference DCV4T. This improvement is mainly ascribed to the large increase in the VOC and FF values. The current results clearly reveal that the structural concept presented here, i.e., integration of fused-ring systems, represents an interesting direction in the design of novel photoactive materials for solar cell applications.
Experimental
Physical measurements and instrumentation
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX 500 (1H NMR: 500 MHz, 13C NMR: 125 MHz) at 100 °C or an Avance 400 spectrometer (1H NMR: 400 MHz, 13C NMR: 100 MHz) at 25 °C unless otherwise noted. Chemical shift values (δ) are expressed in parts per million using residual solvent protons (1H NMR, δH = 7.26 for CDCl3; 1H NMR, δH = 5.92 for TCE; 1H NMR, δH = 5.32 for DCM; 13C NMR, δC = 77.16 for CDCl3) as the internal standard. The splitting patterns are designated as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), and m (multiplet). The assignments are Th-H (thiophene protons), Fu-H (furan protons), Ph-H (phenyl protons), and DCV-H (dicyanovinylene protons). Melting points were determined using a Mettler Toledo DSC 823e and were not corrected. Elemental analyses were performed on an Elementar Vario EL. Thin layer chromatography was carried out on aluminum plates, pre-coated with silica gel, Merck Si60 F254. Preparative column chromatography was performed on glass columns packed with silica gel, Merck Silica 60, particle size 40–43 μm. Electron impact (EI) mass spectra were recorded on a Varian 3800, chemical ionisation (CI) mass spectra on a Finnigan MAT SSQ-7000 and MALDI-TOF mass spectra on a Bruker Daltonics Reflex III.
Optical measurements in solution were carried out in 1 cm cuvettes with Merck Uvasol grade DCM. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 spectrometer and corrected fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS 55 fluorescence spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed with a computer-controlled Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat in a three-electrode single-compartment cell with a platinum working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. All potentials were internally referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple.
Thin film and device fabrication
Thin films and heterojunction solar cell devices were prepared by thermal vapor deposition in an ultra-high vacuum at a base pressure of 10−7 mbar on the substrate at room temperature. Thin films for absorption and emission measurements were prepared on quartz substrates and solar cells on tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) coated glass (Thin Film Devices, USA, sheet resistance of 30 Ω sq−1). Layer thicknesses were determined during evaporation by using quartz crystal monitors calibrated for the respective material. The thin films prepared for absorption and emission measurements are approximately 30 nm thick. The thin film absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2101/3101 UV-vis spectrometer. The thin film emission spectra were recorded with an Edinburgh Instruments FSP920 fluorescence spectrometer. Bulk-heterojunction solar cells were prepared layer by layer without breaking the vacuum. The layer structure of the bulk-heterojunction solar cells is as follows: ITO; 15 nm C60; 20 nm blend layer of respective benzodithiophenes and C60 (ratio of 1:1 by volume) prepared by co-evaporation deposited on the heated substrate (70 °C); 5 nm BPAPF; 50 nm BPAPF doped with NDP9 (purchased from Novaled AG Germany, 10 wt%); 1 nm NDP9; 50 nm gold.
Photovoltaic characterization

J–V and EQE measurements were carried out in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere. J–V characteristics were measured using a source-measure unit (Keithley SMU 2400) and an AM 1.5G sun simulator (KHS Technical Lighting SC1200). The intensity was monitored with a silicon photodiode (Hamamatsu S1337) which was calibrated at Fraunhofer ISE. The mismatch between the spectrum of the sun simulator and the AM 1.5G spectrum was not taken into account. For well-defined active solar cell areas, aperture masks (2.76 mm2) were used. Simple EQE measurements were carried out using the sun simulator in combination with color filters for monochromatic illumination. The illumination intensities were measured with a silicon reference diode (Hamamatsu S1337).
