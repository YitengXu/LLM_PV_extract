    , Accepted 11th January 2023First published on 14th January 2023AbstractAromatic substituent engineering of side chains plays a multi-functional role in molecular structure and properties. In this work, the key aromatic substituted cores of simple nonfullerene acceptors are realized through efficient regioselective acylation. More specifically, two simple nonfullerene acceptors Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD with different phenyl-substituted benzodithiophenedione as the core moiety were synthesized. Ph-BDD with bare benzene rings exhibits stronger aggregation and crystallinity than C4Ph-BDD with butyl benzene rings. Moreover, the single crystal structure of Ph-BDD reveals that a three-dimensional interpenetrating network can be formed due to the compact π–π stacking between the adjacent end-capping groups. With polymer PM6 as the donor, Ph-BDD exhibits a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.64%, attributed to the more balanced carrier mobilities and better phase separation in blend morphology, compared to that of C4Ph-BDD (PCE of 11.37%). Besides, both Ph-BDD- and C4Ph-BDD-based devices can retain 97% of their original efficiency after being stored in air for more than 60 days. Overall, feasible regioselective acylation is of significant importance to flourish of BDD with various aromatic substituents, which has great potential in stable and high-performing nonfullerene solar cells.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have become one of the most attractive photovoltaic technologies owing to their multiple advantages, such as light weight, mechanical flexibility, semi-transparency, and solution processability.1–7 In the past few years, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have been significantly improved due to the continuous efforts in molecular design and device optimization.8–15 Specifically, the emergence of advanced nonfullerene acceptors, e.g. Y6, narrows the gap between lab fabrication and industrialization.16–18 However, Y6-type high-performing nonfullerene acceptors suffer from high synthetic complexity, which would hinder large-scale production in the future.19–21 As such, simple nonfullerene acceptors with high potential in low synthetic complexity, high yields, low cost, and green chemistry have attracted increasing attention.22–31 Molecular design concerning an A–D–A or A–D–A′–D–A framework is promising to construct an efficient simple nonfullerene acceptor, where D is the electron-donating unit and A or A′ is the electron-accepting unit. Hence, the introduction of a simple D or D–A′–D unit as the central core imparts a simple nonfullerene acceptor with low synthetic complexity. Recent advancements of simple nonfullerene acceptors by developing powerful central frameworks and their matching side-chain decorations have boosted the PCEs to a 15% level, but still lagging behind those of Y6-type nonfullerene acceptors. It is in urgent demand to explore new methods for constructing high-performing simple nonfullerene acceptors.32–35
To date, the side chain of the aromatic substituent opens a significant avenue toward widespread chemical tuning on photovoltaic materials. Generally, the insertion of an aromatic substituent into photovoltaic materials can generate impacts on absorption spectra, molecular energy levels, charge carrier mobilities, crystalline properties, and blend morphology, which would result in a comprehensive effect on the photovoltaic performances.36–38 First, the employments of aromatic substituents greatly activate the performances of donor materials in OSCs. Attaching alkylthiophene and alkylbenzene as the aromatic substituents on benzodithiophene (BDT) has provided far-reaching impacts on polymeric donors as well as molecular donors, leading to many well-known examples such as PM6 (ref. 39) and BTR-Cl,40 which continuously break the efficiency records of polymer-based OSCs and all small-molecular OSCs.41 On the other hand, aromatic substituents have also been successfully attached to some nonfullerene acceptors, including several fused-ring nonfullerene acceptors and non-fused ring nonfullerene acceptors.32,38,42–45 Particularly, the attachments of alkylbenzene as the aromatic substituent on 2,2′-bithiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene enable non-fused ring nonfullerene acceptors with PCEs over 15%,45 representing the highest level of device performance for simple nonfullerene acceptors. In chemistry, the incorporation of aromatic substituents mostly relies on cross-coupling reactions, and new methods for aromatic substituted heterocycles are in great demand.
Benzodithiophenedione (BDD) is an important heterocycle, which has been incorporated in many conjugated polymers, including the aforementioned PM6. Recently, we introduced a BDD unit to construct a simple nonfullerene acceptor BDDEH-4F that could deliver a notable PCE of 12.59%.46 Although BDDs of several alkyl- and alkylthio-substitutions have been extensively presented (as summarized in Fig. S1†),47 there is no report about an aromatic substituent on BDD. Herein, two simple nonfullerene acceptors Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD (Fig. 1a) with phenyl and alkylphenyl substituted BDDs, respectively, were synthesized for efficient OSCs. Particularly, we proposed an easy regioselective acylation to realize the phenyl and alkylphenyl substituted BDD dibromides (see the blue dashed box in Fig. 1b), which could be conveniently incorporated in the targeted simple nonfullerene acceptors Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD (Fig. 1c). The single crystal structure was achieved for Ph-BDD, from which its aggregation manner can be revealed. With PM6 as the polymer donor, the photovoltaic performances of the two acceptors were evaluated. Acceptors Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD showed PCEs of 13.64% and 11.37%, respectively. Therefore, the embedded phenyl substitutions by regioselective acylation can enhance the device performance of a BDD based simple nonfullerene acceptor, but the additional butyl groups comprised by C4Ph-BDD will result in an adverse effect. Relative to the C4Ph-BDD based active layer, stronger crystallization ability, higher and more balanced charge transports, and lower extent of bimolecular recombination could be observed by using the PM6:Ph-BDD active layer. For thermal stability, the Ph-BDD based OSCs could retain about 90% of their initial efficiency after 120 h thermal annealing at 80 °C. The Ph-BDD based OSCs also displayed excellent storage stability in air, with ∼97% retention of the original efficiency after 62 days.

2. Results and discussion
The structures and synthetic routes of Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD are shown in Fig. 1. Both acceptors only need four steps with good yields, in the absence of any hazardous organostannane. Fig. 1b shows the synthesis of the key central cores 2a and 2b. The two 2,5-diphenylthiophene-based compounds 1a and 1b were prepared via iterative Suzuki coupling reaction in yields of around 60%. Subsequently, the phenyl substituted BDD compounds 2a and 2b were achieved through regioselective Friedel–Craft acylation (see the blue dashed box in Fig. 1b) due to the different electrophilicities of benzene and thiophene rings in 1a or 1b. Compounds 2a and 2b were obtained in 60% and 65% yields, respectively, indicating efficient acylation reactions. Therefore, the phenyl and alkylphenyl substituents in 1a and 1b do not confer any negative impacts when compared with the preparations of alkyl-substituted BDDs in previous reports. As shown in Fig. 1c, instead of the traditional Stille coupling, the dialdehyde compounds 3a and 3b were prepared by palladium-catalyzed C–H activation direct coupling reactions between the phenyl substituted BDDs (2a and 2b) and bis(2-ethylhexyl)-cyclopentadithiophene-2-carbaldehyde without a toxic organostannane intermediate. The yields for 3a and 3b were 70% and 68%, respectively. The target products Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD were obtained through base-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensations in high yields of 80% and 82%, respectively. Chemical structures of compounds 2a, 2b and the target products were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (as shown in Fig. S2–S6†). In addition, both acceptors exhibit good solubilities in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene at room temperature. The thermal properties of Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), showing high decomposition temperatures (Td for 5% weight loss) at 358 and 349 °C, respectively (as shown in Fig. S7†). The good thermal stabilities of Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD completely satisfy the requirements of OSC device fabrication.
UV-vis absorption spectra of dilute solution (1 × 10−5 M) and film of Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD are depicted in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. In solutions, Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD display the absorption peaks at 705 and 714 nm, respectively, while for the film absorptions, the corresponding absorption peaks are located at 692 and 694 nm, respectively (Table S1†). Relative to the solution, the blue-shifted film absorptions for Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD suggest there H-aggregations existed in the solid state. In the meantime, the two films can exhibit obviously red-shifted absorption bands in the long wavelength region when compared with their solutions, indicating that the two molecules also form J-aggregations in the solid state.48 Therefore, both H- and J-aggregations existed in the films of Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD at the same time, which is similar to other materials reported before.49

(f) GIWAXS line-cut profiles in the OOP and IP directions for the pristine films of Ph-BDD, and C4Ph-BDD. 
For the absorbance in solution, Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD show some difference in theextinction coefficient. The calculated maximum molar extinction coefficients (ε) for Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD are 1.85 × 105 and 1.63 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively (Table S1†). In addition, the relatively larger extinction ability by Ph-BDD can be retained in the aggregation state (Fig. 2c). Compared to C4Ph-BDD, the extent of absorption tail in the low energy region can be suppressed by the Ph-BDD film, implying that the Ph-BDD molecule has a higher-ordered arrangement in the solid state.50 Based on the absorption edges of the films, acceptor C4Ph-BDD gives a slightly lower optical bandgap (Egopt) of 1.39 eV compared to that of 1.46 eV for Ph-BDD (Table S1†). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted to characterize the electrochemical properties of C4Ph-BDD and Ph-BDD by using the Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode and ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal reference (Fig. S8†). The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of Ph-BDD are −5.55 and −3.93 eV, respectively, while those for C4Ph-BDD are −5.59 and −3.89 eV, respectively (Table S1†). Compared with the reported BDDEH-4F, a BDD molecule with a phenyl substituent can show an upshifting LUMO energy level, which is beneficial for increasing the Voc of relevant OSCs.
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was conducted to further investigate the molecular packing and orientation behaviors of the pristine films of the two acceptors (Fig. 2d and e). The relevant line-cut profiles are shown in Fig. 2f, with structural parameters summarized in Table S2.† The pristine film of Ph-BDD exhibits obvious diffraction peaks in the in-plane (IP) direction at q vectors of 0.331 and 0.435 Å−1 associated with a strong diffraction peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction at a q of 0.441 Å−1. The diffraction feature of both strong diffractions in the IP and OOP directions suggests that Ph-BDD adopts a bimodal orientation mode similar to other materials reported before.51–53 Based on the diffraction at the q vector of 1.754 Å−1 in the OOP direction, the Ph-BDD molecules show a π–π stacking distance of 3.59 Å. For C4Ph-BDD carrying two additional butyl groups, the diffraction intensity becomes very weak. Therefore, the different chemical structures of the two acceptors have a great impact on their crystallization properties. Attaching an additional butyl group on benzene will hinder the molecular crystallization.
Single crystallography can provide detailed information about the molecular geometries and intermolecular stacking modes of organic compounds.54,55 Because of the higher crystallization ability of Ph-BDD, its single crystal can be obtained via the vapor diffusion method. The single-crystal structure of Ph-BDD is shown in Fig. 3a, with detailed crystal parameters listed in Table S3.† The dihedral angles of a Ph-BDD molecule are 4.68° (θ1), 18.95° (θ2), 15.16° (θ3), and 2.99° (θ4), and the slightly twisted skeleton of the acceptor molecule can prevent its over-aggregation in the blend film.56 As mentioned above, H- and J-aggregations can be formed simultaneously in the Ph-BDD film. Interestingly, the single crystal structure can confirm this information. The Ph-BDD dimer forms H-type aggregation and one dimer interacts with four dimers to form J-type aggregations (Fig. 3b). Moreover, the distances for π–π stackings between phenyl rings are 3.314 Å, shorter than those for π–π stackings between terminal groups (3.352 Å and 3.390 Å). For J-type aggregation, the distances for π–π stackings between phenyl and terminal groups are 3.382 Å and the distances for π–π stackings between end-capping groups are in the range of 3.338–3.368 Å. Therefore, the π–π stacking interactions in H-aggregated mode are stronger than those in J-aggregated mode. Moreover, multiple stacking between the Ph-BDD molecules results in a 3D interpenetrated network (as shown in Fig. 3c and d) for highly efficient charge transport.

To investigate the impact of the different phenyl substituents on the photovoltaic performance, the popular wide-bandgap conjugated polymer PM6 was chosen as the electron donor to construct the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers, ensuring the effective charge separation and absorption complementarity. Inverted devices were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer (ca. 110 nm)/MoO3/Al. The optimizations of the devices are summarized in Tables S4 and S5,† including polymer:acceptor (D:A) ratios, thermal annealing conditions, and content of solvent additive. The optimized conditions include a D:A weight ratio of 1:1, a 0.5% v/v content of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), and thermal annealing at 170 °C for 10 min. The J–V curves of the optimized devices are depicted in Fig. 4a, with photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 1. For the as-cast devices, the Ph-BDD-based devices show a decent PCE of 8.15%, which is higher than the PCE of the C4Ph-BDD-based device of 6.48%. Intriguingly, a significantly improved Jsc and FF could be obtained for both active layers after optimization. Specifially for the Ph-BDD-based device, Jsc was elevated from 17.19 to 24.07 mA cm−2, and the FF was improved from 52.64% to 65.80%, thus affording a much higher PCE of 13.64% (Table 1). In comparison, because of the lower Jsc of 21.33 mA cm−2 and FF of 60.50%, the optimized devices based on C4Ph-BDD exhibited a lower PCE of 11.37%, which was also lower than that of the device based on the sole alkyl side chain substituted BDD-incorporated acceptor.46 For C4Ph-BDD, the additional butyl groups would bring some steric hindrance, leading to weakened aggregation and charge transport. The higher Jsc and FF of the Ph-BDD based OSCs might be attributed to the simple phenyl groups with less steric hindrance, which facilitated stronger stacking and higher crystallinity. Therefore, the simple phenyl substitution on BDD plays an exquisite role in improving the photovoltaic performance of BDD-based nonfullerene acceptors.

The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized OSC devices are shown in Fig. 4b. The optimized OSC based on Ph-BDD delivered a much stronger EQE photoresponse from 300 to 800 nm, when compared to that based on C4Ph-BDD. Notably, even with a small HOMO offset between PM6 and Ph-BDD, strong EQE responses of over 70% (peaking at 720 nm with 83.26%) can be observed in a wide range of 440–810 nm, suggesting that both the polymer donor and acceptor absorptions contribute to the EQE responses. In contrast, the optimized C4Ph-BDD-based active layer shows lower EQE throughout the whole spectral range, with a maximum EQE value of 73.38% at 600 nm. The integrated Jsc calculated from the EQE curves for the Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD based devices are 23.48 and 20.55 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the Jsc values from the J–V curves (within 5% mismatch).
The device stability of OSCs is important to the practical application. Here, the thermal stability and storage stability of the Ph-BDD-based and C4Ph-BDD-based devices were investigated. Thermal stability was tested by heating the devices at 80 °C in an N2-filled glovebox for 5 days. As shown in Fig. 4c, in the first 48 h, the devices were subjected to a burn-in stage, during which Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD-based devices lost about 11% and 25% of their original efficiency, respectively. After that, the devices became very stable and could still retain about 90% and 75% of the initial efficiency after 120 h thermal annealing, implying good thermal stability of Ph-BDD-based devices. To explore storage stability, devices were stored in air at room temperature for more than 60 days. Without a notable burn-in stage, both Ph-BDD-based and C4Ph-BDD-based devices could retain about 97% of their original efficiency even after 62 days, showing excellent storage stability in air. Furthermore, to find out the reason for the excellent stability, we calculated the variation of relevant performance parameters. As shown in Fig. S9a and b,† the variation of relevant parameters of all the devices after being heated at 80 °C for an hour was listed. Most devices exhibit stable Voc and slightly declined Jsc after being heated. However, due to the general improvement of FF, the relevant devices obtain better PCEs than the original efficiencies. When extending thermal time to 120 hours, the Ph-BDD-based devices can still retain a high FF while the C4Ph-BDD-based devices encountered a severely decreased FF (as shown in Fig. S9c and d†). Therefore, the excellent stability of Ph-BDD-based devices is mainly ascribed to the more stable morphology. We also calculated the variational parameters during the testing process of storage stability (as shown in Fig. S9e and f†). Encouragingly, Ph-BDD-based devices exhibited high storage stability accompanied by nearly unchangeable FF and Jsc at room temperature. Surprisingly, C4Ph-BDD-based devices can maintain about 97% of the original efficiency, similar to Ph-BDD-based devices. It should be noted that both Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD-based devices exhibit better thermal stability and storage stability than those based on BDDEH-4F-incorporated ones.46 As a consequence, the introduction of aromatic substituents into simple nonfullerene acceptors is beneficial for device stability.
To investigate the exciton dynamics of the blend films, photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were performed preliminarily (Fig. S10†). When exciting PM6 at 610 nm, the PL quenching efficiencies (PLQEs) of the optimized blend films of PM6:Ph-BDD and PM6:C4Ph-BDD were 98.30% and 98.24%, respectively, indicating efficient photoinduced electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor (Table 2). When exciting the acceptors at 740 nm, the PLQEs of PM6:Ph-BDD and PM6:C4Ph-BDD were 97.90% and 97.09%, respectively. As such, the exciton dissociation is quite close in both blends. On the other hand, we calculated the exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) in the devices, according to previous reports (Table 2).57 Under short-circuit conditions, the Pdiss values of the optimized OSC devices were 99.56% and 99.21% for Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD, respectively (Fig. S11a†). The slightly higher Pdiss for the PM6:Ph-BDD active layer indicates more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction, thus affording larger Jsc and efficiency in devices. Further tracing the relationship between Jsc and light intensity (Plight) can shed light on the charge recombination dynamics (Fig. S11b†).58 The fitted slope α values for PM6:Ph-BDD and PM6:C4Ph-BDD based optimized devices are 0.874 and 0.862, respectively. The higher α of the Ph-BDD-based device suggests a lower extent of bimolecular recombination, which is consistent with its higher FF.

The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was utilized to investigate the charge transport properties of the blend films (Fig. S12†). The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) values of the blend films (ca. 110 nm) are summarized in Table 2. The μe value of the Ph-BDD pristine film is 2.69 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, slightly higher than that (1.64 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) of C4Ph-BDD. The μh and μe values of the optimized PM6:Ph-BDD blend film are 4.78 × 10−4 and 2.94 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, giving a μh/μe ratio of 1.63. In comparison, the optimized PM6:C4Ph-BDD blend film shows a lower μh value of 4.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a decreased μe value of 1.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The much larger μh/μe ratio of 3.27 suggested imbalanced charge transport and more charge recombination for the PM6:C4Ph-BDD active layer, which contributed to the lower Jsc and FF. It should be noted that the two blend films exhibit higher μe relative to the corresponding pure films. Similar observations have been reported before.22 A PBDTTT-E-T:IEICO blend film showed an electron mobility of 4.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, higher than that (1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the pure IEICO film.59 Furthermore, 2D GIWAXS images of the PM6 pristine film and blend film and the relevant line-cut profiles in the OOP and IP directions are shown in Fig. 5. For pristine PM6, a lamellar distance of 22.68 Å and a π–π distance of 3.76 Å can be obtained from the IP (100) and OOP (010) peaks, respectively. After mixing the acceptors, the two blend films both exhibited a face-on dominated orientation. In the PM6:Ph-BDD blend film, a new OOP peak at qz of ∼0.62 Å−1 can be found, implying that an enhanced crystallinity existed. Furthermore, enhanced OOP peaks are found for the two blend films, which display more compact π–π stacking with π–π distances of 3.66 and 3.71 Å for the Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD based blend films, respectively. Due to the bare benzene ring with low steric hindrance, the Ph-BDD-based blend film exhibited a stronger π–π stacking, which is more beneficial for fast electron transport in the vertical direction.

To better explain the different device performances of Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD, the surface and bulk morphologies of the blend films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As indicated in Fig. 5e and f, all the optimized Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD-based blend films show fairly smooth surfaces with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.33 and 2.15 nm, respectively. C4Ph-BDD with a butyl phenyl ring contributes to the smoother surface of the BHJ blend film. We measured the contact angles (Fig. S13†) and calculated surface energies (Table S6†) of the pristine films of PM6, Ph-BDD, and C4Ph-BDD to reveal the miscibility between PM6 and the simple nonfullerene acceptors.60–63 The estimated Flory–Huggins interaction parameters (χD, A) are 2.16 mK and 2.84 mK for PM6:Ph-BDD and PM6:C4Ph-BDD, respectively.64–66 Hence, the PM6:Ph-BDD-based film tends to form a more intermixed morphology, while the PM6:C4Ph-BDD-based film shows severe phase separation, which is harmful for exciton dissociation. With well-mixed and compact stacking morphology, the PM6:Ph-BDD blend achieved higher Jsc and FF values. According to TEM measurement, the Ph-BDD-based blend film exhibits bicontinuous interpenetrating networks with a well-dispersed fibrillar structure (Fig. 5g). In comparison, the C4Ph-BDD-based blend film lacks such a fibrillar structure, showing severe phase separation. Therefore, higher and more balanced charge transport was found in the PM6:Ph-BDD blend film (Table 2).
3. Conclusion
In summary, two new BDD units of aromatic substituents were successfully synthesized by regioselective acylation, which constructed two simple nonfullerene acceptors Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD for the first time. Relative to C4Ph-BDD with butyl benzene rings, Ph-BDD with a bare benzene ring showcased stronger molecular packing and higher crystallinity. Therefore, the Ph-BDD-based active layers demonstrate higher and more balanced charge transport as well as favorable morphology. A higher PCE of 13.64% can be achieved for the Ph-BDD-based devices while the C4Ph-BDD-based devices show a lower PCE of 11.37%. The devices based on Ph-BDD and C4Ph-BDD both show good thermal and storage stability. Our work paves a new way for the synthesis of novel BDD with an aromatic substituent, which will make a breakthrough not only in the field of simple nonfullerene acceptors but also in polymer donors.
