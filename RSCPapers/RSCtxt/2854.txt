    , Accepted 18th December 2022First published on 23rd December 2022AbstractIonic defects generated from the grain boundaries and surfaces of perovskite films are primary factors that degrade the nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, and therefore filling or eliminating these defects is crucial for achieving high-performance NLO devices. Herein, a new passivation strategy is proposed via binding the functional groups of porphyrins with the defects of perovskite films. A series of porphyrin-modified perovskite films were successfully constructed and exhibited significantly enhanced optical nonlinearity in broadband regions and temporal domains, compared with the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film. In particular, the corresponding NLO absorption coefficient (β) of MAPbI3/ZnP3 (β = 116.65 cm GW−1) at 800 nm in the femtosecond (fs) regime is one order of magnitude larger than that of the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film (β = 6.09 cm GW−1), which can be ascribed to the increased photo-induced ground state dipole moment of the passivated perovskite during the two-photon absorption (TPA) process and the photo-induced electron/energy transfer between the porphyrin and perovskite. In the nanosecond (ns) regime, all modified samples showed prominent reverse saturable absorption (RSA) at 1064 nm and saturable absorption (SA) at 532 nm determined by their free carrier absorption and band-filling effect, respectively. These observations strongly confirm that the passivation strategy through the effective coordination interaction between porphyrin functional groups and perovskite defects can considerably improve the NLO performance of perovskite materials. Our work affords a feasible paradigm for developing adaptable perovskite photonic devices in diverse laser pulse width and wavelength regions.
Introduction
Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials have wide application prospects in optical limiters,1 all-optical communication,2 optical signal modulation and processing,3 and optical sensors.4 Developing high-performance NLO materials has always been an important academic issue and a key technological difficulty. Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites exhibit favorable photoelectric properties such as long electron–hole diffusion length,5–7 long charge carrier life,8–10 large absorption range,11,12 moderate exciton binding energy,13,14 and tunable band gap,15–17 and can be utilized as an active medium to promote light production and amplification, thus enabling applications in NLO materials and devices. For example, Pastor et al. reported a series of polycrystalline MAPbX3 perovskite films (X3 = I3, Br3, and Br1.5I1.5), which exhibited excellent multiphoton absorption under nanosecond (ns) pulsed laser at 1064 nm.18 Wang et al. reported large saturable absorption (SA) behavior of methylammonium lead iodide films and achieved a Q-switched laser with an output power of 388 mW and a pulse width of 192 ns.19 Although considerable efforts have been made to develop high-performance perovskite-based NLO materials, current research is still under restrictions due to perovskite defects. Polycrystalline perovskites prepared by a solution deposition process would inevitably have a large number of ionic defects on the surface and grain boundaries.20 These defects not only induce trap states in perovskites, leading to faster nonradiative charge recombination and energy loss,21 but also bring about the degradation of the perovskite structure,22 dramatically weakening the perovskite NLO performance.23 Accordingly, an urgent challenge emerging in this domain is how to reduce perovskite defects for strong NLO performance.
Theoretical studies elucidate that defects in the perovskite are mainly generated from the loss of terminal halide ions and organic ammonium ions (e.g., methylammonium cation (MA+)) at the edge of the perovskite lattice.24–26 MA+ is unstable under high temperature and moisture conditions and escapes from the perovskite lattice, leading to the generation of under-coordinated I− to form negatively charged defects. The absence of I− in the terminal structure of perovskites results in the exposure of under-coordinated Pb2+, along with the formation of positively charged defects.27 Given these issues, the introduction of organic molecules as passivators to compensate or fill perovskite defects is a promising strategy. For instance, Han and co-workers employed triphenylamine dye AQ310 to interact with under-coordinated Pb2+ in perovskites, greatly suppressing the formation of defects and nonradiative charge recombination.28 In contrast, Huang and co-workers embedded phenethylamine and D-4-tert-butylphenylalanine into perovskites to heal trap states by passivating negative defects and achieved an optimal power conversion efficiency of 21.4%.29 Despite these studies, most passivation efforts concentrate on the performance evaluation of photoelectric devices, e.g., solar cells and photodetectors, while the correlation between the passivation effect and the NLO response has been largely unexploited to date. It is therefore highly essential to correlate perovskites and photoactive building blocks utilizing the passivation effect of organic molecules to explore their internal light response behaviors behind the NLO properties.
Porphyrins and their derivatives, as mature optical functional materials, exhibit strong NLO responses due to their large excited state absorption cross-sections and long triplet-excitation lifetimes originating from specific delocalized π-conjugated structures.30–32 The introduction of porphyrins into perovskites is anticipated to afford new nanohybrid materials with a higher NLO performance by combining the merits of both precursor compounds, widely capable of applications in the broadband regions and temporal regimes. First, porphyrin molecules with tunable hyperpolarizabilities by specific functional group modification can be employed as promising passivators to fill defects for stabilizing perovskite structures. Second, the appropriate molecule size of porphyrins will not damage the intrinsic crystal structure of perovskites, ensuring the expression of NLO behavior in the pristine perovskite. Third, relevant research studies have shown that the self-assembly of porphyrins promotes charge transport and hole extraction capabilities between porphyrins and perovskites, which is conducive for the improvement of NLO performance.33,34 However, there are few high-profile cases about introducing porphyrin derivatives into perovskites to obtain nanohybrid materials with eminent and versatile photoresponse characteristics. Particularly, the related studies of their NLO behaviors in the broadband regions and temporal regimes are currently unclear.
In this study, four zinc(II) tetraphenylporphyrin molecules appended with monoamino (–NH2), tetraamino (–4NH2), monocarboxyl (–COOH), and tetracarboxyl (–4COOH) moieties, as shown in Fig. 1a (denoted as ZnP1, ZnP2, ZnP3, and ZnP4, respectively), were well designed and synthesized to passivate ionic defects within MAPbI3 perovskites. Porphyrin-modified MAPbI3 films were constructed and their NLO properties were first investigated by Z-scan techniques under irradiation with both femtosecond (fs) regime (515 and 800 nm) and ns regime (532 and 1064 nm) pulses. The characterization demonstrates that the –NH2, –COOH group functionalized porphyrins can provide better passivation conditions for the coordination with under-coordinated I− and Pb2+ in perovskites. Consequently, the trap states are therefore minimized, resulting in a greatly improved NLO performance for these perovskite films. The NLO absorption coefficient (β) values of the MAPbI3/ZnP1 (β = 61.49 cm GW−1) and the MAPbI3/ZnP3 films (β = 116.65 cm GW−1) are even one order of magnitude larger than that of the pristine MAPbI3 film (β = 6.09 cm GW−1) at 800 nm under fs pulse. This superb NLO performance can be associated with the elevated two-photon absorption (TPA) process, which is ascribed to the photo-induced ground state dipole moment of perovskites enhanced by porphyrin passivation and the photo-induced electron/energy transfer between porphyrins and perovskites. Meanwhile, porphyrin-modified MAPbI3 films also exhibited intensive saturable absorption (SA) and reverse saturable absorption (RSA) behaviors in broadband regions (515, 532, and 1064 nm) and different temporal domains (fs and ns). The enhanced SA responses under both fs laser excitation at 515 nm and ns laser at 532 nm can be attributed to the fact that the defect passivation intensifies the band-filling effect and exciton binding energy in perovskites. The passivation offers abundant excitation pathways, facilitating the free carrier absorption to obtain a stronger RSA under ns laser irradiation at 1064 nm. Furthermore, porphyrins with greater charge separation and larger transition dipole moment are pretty beneficial for synergistically enhancing the NLO properties. Porphyrin-modified MAPbI3 films also exhibit stronger self-focusing type nonlinear refractive behaviors than the pristine film, which can be due to their improved free carrier nonlinearities from the improved TPA and increased carrier concentration after porphyrin passivation. Our work not only demonstrates that porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films serve as a new family of high-performance NLO materials, extending the cognition of the relationship between passivation effects and optical nonlinearities, but also affords a new option for constructing feasible and efficient perovskite NLO devices through defect modulation.

5. Perovskite layer fabrication
All manipulations were conducted in air unless specially stated. Glass substrates with dimensions of 20 mm × 20 mm were cleaned in ultrasonic baths of acetone, deionized water, and isopropanol in turn. Then the washed glass substrates were dried by N2 flow and treated as hydrophilic surfaces by UV plasma for 10 min before use. Solvents and precursor solutions were filtered with a 0.22 μm nylon syringe filter in advance. The perovskite MAPbI3 (the concentration of Pb2+ is 1.3 M) precursor solution was composed of PbI2 and MAI in a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 in a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and DMF (1:5, v/v). The mixture solution was stirred at room temperature overnight. The precursor solution was spin-coated onto the glass substrate using two steps at 2000 rpm for 5 s and 6000 rpm for 50 s, respectively. Then anti-solvent chloroform of 600 μL was spin-coated quickly onto it at 30 s during the second step, whereafter, the substrate was thermally annealed at 65 °C for 10 min and 100 °C for 10 min. For porphyrin-passivated perovskite films, different porphyrin molecules were directly dissolved in the perovskite precursor solution as additives, and the content was 0.05 wt% of the PbI2 amount. Finally, the spin-coated perovskite films were packed in a vacuum or preserved in a nitrogen-filled glove box for further characterization.
Results and discussion
1. Synthesis
A series of zinc(II) tetraphenylporphyrin derivatives ZnP1, ZnP2, ZnP3, and ZnP4 were successfully synthesized in three to four steps (Scheme S1, ESI†), and the structures are shown in Fig. 1a. The as-prepared porphyrins were incorporated as passivators into the MAPbI3 perovskite films through the solution deposition process, in which the porphyrins are dissolved directly in the perovskite precursor solution and subsequently spin-coated onto the glass substrates. After that, the films underwent two thermal annealing processes to obtain the pristine MAPbI3 as well as ZnP1-, ZnP2-, ZnP3-, and ZnP4-modified MAPbI3 perovskite films (denoted as MAPbI3/ZnP1, MAPbI3/ZnP2, MAPbI3/ZnP3, and MAPbI3/ZnP4, respectively). Fig. 1b shows the passivation mode of these porphyrins to perovskites, where the amino groups of ZnP1 and ZnP2 passivate the negatively charged defect, i.e., under-coordinated I−, and the carboxyl groups of ZnP3 and ZnP4 form effective coordination interaction with the positively charged defect, i.e., under-coordinated Pb2+. This mode affords a more stable structure of the perovskite and more efficient electron/energy transfer that drive better NLO properties. Several characterization methods were performed to elucidate the interaction between these porphyrins and perovskites.
2. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to investigate the influence of porphyrin passivation on the MAPbI3 film. As shown in Fig. 1c, the dominant diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 28.4°, and 31.8° correspond to the (110), (220), and (310) tetragonal crystal structures of the MAPbI3 perovskite, respectively.41,42 The other six peaks are in line with the intrinsic crystallographic phases of MAPbI3 as previously reported.43 The extremely small peak observed at 12.4° is assigned to the crystal plane of PbI2. The weak intensity of PbI2 indicates that almost all PbI2 phases participate in the formation of the perovskite. Little change in the XRD patterns indicates that the crystallization of porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films was not affected by the introduction of large size organic molecules in comparison with the pristine MAPbI3 film, and thus the MAPbI3 films passivated by porphyrins retain good grain and crystal orientation.44
The surface morphology of the pristine and porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films was evaluated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). As shown in Fig. 2a–e, all samples composed of small irregular particles possess full and uniform surfaces. The grain sizes of the porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films (429.4, 356.4, 552.1, and 620.5 nm for ZnP1-, ZnP2-, ZnP3-, and ZnP4-passivated perovskite films) are larger than that of the pristine MAPbI3 film (199.1 nm), which can be attributed to the strong coordination interaction between the porphyrin and perovskite. Due to a large number of pinholes and defects in the pristine MAPbI3 film, when porphyrins are incorporated into the perovskite crystal lattice, the functional groups (–NH2, –COOH) in porphyrins could fill the vacancies caused by the absence of MA+ and I−. This can provide a lower nucleation barrier and decrease the Gibbs free energy of perovskite crystallization, facilitating the growth of large perovskite grains.45 The results reveal that the incorporation of porphyrins can effectively reduce the defects and tailor grain growth. In addition, the impact of the porphyrin content on the growth behavior of perovskite films was further explored. Taking the MAPbI3/ZnP1 film as an example, the SEM images of the MAPbI3 films without and with ZnP1 contents of 0.01%, 0.05%, and 0.1% modification were obtained. Fig. 2b and Fig. S1 (ESI†) show that both excess and inadequate porphyrin additives reduce the grain sizes. Broken grains induce the formation of a large number of defects and holes, which destabilize the perovskite structure.26 To further study the distribution of porphyrin molecules in perovskite films, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was performed and elemental mapping images are shown in Fig. 2g and Fig. S2 (ESI†). The results confirm the presence of the Zn element, which exhibits excellent homogeneity and dispersity in the porphyrin-modified MAPbI3 film, indicating that porphyrins can effectively participate in the crystallization process of MAPbI3 and possess good compatibility with perovskites.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were conducted to understand the interaction between porphyrin passivators and perovskites. Fig. 3a shows the FTIR spectra of ZnP1, MAPbI3, and MAPbI3/ZnP1 to discuss the coordination interaction behavior of –NH2 of the porphyrin and negatively charged defects in the MAPbI3/ZnP1 film. As can be seen, the bending vibration of the –NH3+ bond was observed at 1646 cm−1 in the pristine MAPbI3 film, but not in ZnP1. The weakened and broad peak attributed to the –NH3+ bending vibration in MAPbI3/ZnP1 was also observed at 1646 cm−1, indicating that the transformation of –NH2 to –NH3+ occurred after ZnP1 passivation. The results demonstrate the strong coordination interaction between the –NH2 of the porphyrin and the MAPbI3 film,46 with the interacted site being shown in Fig. 1b (red dotted circle). Also, the C–C bending vibration peak at 1340 cm−1 and C–H bond deformation vibration peak at 702 cm−1 corresponding to the phenyl ring skeleton and the pyrrole ring in ZnP1, respectively, were observed in MAPbI3/ZnP1 instead of the pristine MAPbI3 film, which verifies the presence of ZnP1 in the MAPbI3/ZnP1 film. Such a phenomenon was also observed in the FTIR spectra of the MAPbI3 film passivated by ZnP2, as shown in Fig. S3a (ESI†). To expound on the coordination interaction behavior between CO of the porphyrin and the PbI2-terminated perovskite surface in the MAPbI3/ZnP3 film, the FTIR spectra of ZnP3 and the ZnP3-PbI2 mixture (prepared by blending ZnP3 with PbI2) were recorded and are shown in Fig. 3b. The stretching vibration of the CO bond in the pure ZnP3 was observed at 1683 cm−1, which is consistent with the characteristic peak of the carboxyl group.47 Compared with the pure ZnP3, the CO bond stretching vibration peak in the ZnP3–PbI2 shifts to a lower wavenumber of 1653 cm−1. The downward shift can be attributed to the electron delocalization in the CO bond during the formation of the Lewis acid–base adduct, indicating the effective coordination interaction between the –COOH group in the porphyrin and under-coordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite.28,48 The schematic diagram of the interaction behavior is shown in Fig. 1b (blue dotted circle), and the FTIR spectra of the ZnP4-passivated MAPbI3 film also reveal similar results (Fig. S3b, ESI†).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to afford additional proof related to the interaction behavior of porphyrins with perovskites. The interfaced coordination state of the Pb element before and after porphyrin treatment was investigated and is shown in Fig. 3c. The porphyrin-modified MAPbI3 films displayed two main peaks at 137.9 and 142.7 eV for MAPbI3/ZnP1, 136.7 and 141.6 eV for MAPbI3/ZnP2, 137.2 and 142.1 eV for MAPbI3/ZnP3, and 137.3 and 142.2 eV for MAPbI3/ZnP4, respectively, whereas the pristine MAPbI3 film showed two main peaks located at 138.3 and 143.1 eV, corresponding to the Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2. The peaks of Pb 4f shifted to lower binding energies after porphyrin modification, which can be ascribed to the interaction between the porphyrin active sites and the defects on the MAPbI3 surface. For MAPbI3/ZnP1 and MAPbI3/ZnP2 films, the –NH2 functional group is protonated by MA+ to form –NH3+ and acquires electrons from the under-coordinated I− (due to loss of MA+) in the MAPbI3 film, generating the high electron density on the adjacent Pb nucleus and leading to a shift to a lower binding energy.49–51 For MAPbI3/ZnP3 and MAPbI3/ZnP4 films, the decrease in binding energies of Pb 4f orbitals can be regarded as the result of the Pb nucleus acquiring electrons via the effective coordination interaction of –COOH with under-coordinated Pb2+. Similarly, the XPS data for the I 3d core level spectra in Fig. 3d also verify the interaction between the porphyrin and perovskite. Moreover, the observed binding energy of Zn 2p3/2 at 1020.7 eV for the MAPbI3/ZnP1 film in Fig. 3e demonstrates the existence of porphyrins in MAPbI3, which is in excellent accordance with the results reflected by FTIR spectra and elemental mapping images above. It is worthwhile mentioning that the peak at 528.9 eV on behalf of the Pb–O component was observed in Fig. 3f, intuitively revealing the effective coordination interaction between the –COOH in the porphyrin and under-coordinated Pb2+ in MAPbI3.52,53

Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) measurements were carried out to investigate the optical absorption performance of the pristine and porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films. The UV-Vis spectra profiled in Fig. 4a show strong broadband absorption from visible to near-infrared regions. Absorption onsets at around 785 nm were observed for all samples, which are related to the optical band gap of perovskite films. Additionally, the overall shape of the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the passivated perovskite films remains intact, but compared with the pristine perovskite film, the stronger absorption widely appears in the whole region, especially in the near UV band, which is attributed to the fact that cross-linking of adjacent grains through passivation of defects by porphyrins improves the crystallinity and film quality.54 As a result, the perovskite/perovskite interface is significantly increased, facilitating more light absorption for photogenerated carriers in the absence of mid-gap surface states and shallow surface states.55,56 More importantly, the strong absorption of photosensitized porphyrins with high extinction coefficient in the near UV band enhances the absorption of the perovskite layer in the near UV band, resulting in higher absorbance.26,57–61

It is documented that rapid nonradiative charge recombination in the pristine perovskite would lead to faster photoluminescence decay due to the existence of defects. This is due to the fact that the photoluminescence (PL) properties of perovskite materials originate from unstable excited state carriers. Carriers decay to the ground state through nonradiative and radiative processes, and the latter releases energy in the form of photons, which determines the PL intensity of the perovskite material.62 Steady-state PL measurements were carried out to assess the passivation effect of porphyrin molecules with different configurations on MAPbI3 films. The corresponding PL curves were obtained under light excitation at 532 nm, as presented in Fig. 4b. The weak emission peak for the pristine MAPbI3 film observed at 779 nm indicates that a large number of defects (e.g., amorphous regions, surface defects, or grain boundaries) may cause charge recombination loss.63 Such loss is usually in the form of nonradiative decay that is not accompanied by the release of photons. However, when the porphyrins are introduced into the MAPbI3 films, the PL intensity increases obviously, demonstrating that the –COOH and –NH2 groups of porphyrins passivate the defects in the perovskite, extending the carrier diffusion distance and thereby noticeably suppressing nonradiative charge recombination.64,65 Also, greater absorbance in porphyrin-passivated perovskite films is conducive to the generation of more excited state carriers, increasing the probability of carriers’ radiative recombination and thus also resulting in an enhanced PL intensity. It is well-known that the spontaneous radiative carrier recombination via trap states leads to a red-shifted emission, which means that the emission peak can realize a blue-shift through the passivation of these trap states.66 The emission peaks of MAPbI3 films treated with ZnP1, ZnP2, ZnP3, and ZnP4 are located at 778, 776, 778, and 775 nm, respectively. The blue-shifts of the porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films compared to the pristine MAPbI3 film indicate that trap states in perovskites are reduced due to porphyrin passivation. Interestingly, comparing the PL curves of the different porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films, the emission intensities of MAPbI3/ZnP1, MAPbI3/ZnP3, MAPbI3/ZnP4, and MAPbI3/ZnP2 showed a weakening tendency. This can be attributed to the photo-induced electron/energy transfer process, in which internal electrons/energies are transported between special functional groups of porphyrins and defect sites in perovskites. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were conducted to give further insights into the dynamic effects of the porphyrin passivation on perovskite defects. The obtained decay curves were fitted with a bi-exponential decay function. The equation is as follows: (5)where y0 is the decay constant, and A1 and A2 are PL decay amplitudes. The TRPL decay curves of the pristine and porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films are shown in Fig. 4c, which show fast and slow time processes. The short lifetime τ1 represents the charge-trapping assisted nonradiative recombination process, and the long lifetime τ2 is a slow decay component related to the detrapping process or the photogenerated carrier radiative recombination process.67 The PL decay of the pristine MAPbI3 film is governed by the trapping state process, with the τ1 and τ2 calculated to be 0.08 and 0.53 ns. However, prolonged lifetimes were observed in the MAPbI3 films passivated by ZnP1 (τ1 = 0.55 ns and τ2 = 13.19 ns), ZnP2 (τ1 = 0.73 ns and τ2 = 3.36 ns), ZnP3 (τ1 = 0.53 ns and τ2 = 11.26 ns), and ZnP4 (τ1 = 0.56 ns and τ2 = 8.45 ns), respectively. Employing porphyrins as passivators remarkably enhances the τ1 values, proving the positive impact of porphyrins in the passivation of the MAPbI3 perovskite layer surface. The significant increase in τ2 implies that porphyrin molecules diffuse deeply into the grains of the MAPbI3 film during the passivation process, and the density of charge trapping states decreases, thus suppressing the nonradiative recombination. Briefly, the reduced nonradiative recombination in porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films indicates that fewer trap states in perovskites stem from the effective passivation of porphyrins, which is in agreement with the PL measurements.
4. NLO properties at fs pulsed laser in different wavelengths
Considering that the porphyrin-passivated perovskite films with stable structure and effective charge/energy transfer are expected to exhibit prominent nonlinear absorption capacities, their third-order optical nonlinearities were investigated. Open-aperture Z-scan measurements were carried out on the pristine and ZnP1, ZnP2, ZnP3, and ZnP4-passivated MAPbI3 films at the wavelengths of 800 and 515 nm, respectively, under 34 fs pulsed laser conditions. The measurement details of the Z-scan technique are referred to from previously reported literature.18,39,68 The cross-section thicknesses of all films were measured by SEM (Fig. 2f and Fig. S4, ESI†) before the experiment and are shown in Table 1. The nonlinear absorption of the blank glass substrate was also measured under the same conditions, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). No distinct NLO response suggests that the influence of the glass substrate on the experimental results can be neglected. The curves at three different positions for each perovskite sample were measured under different laser conditions and the results are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The consistency at different locations of samples demonstrates good homogeneity of the as-prepared films as well as stable and credible NLO performance. Open-aperture Z-scan results of the pristine and porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films under fs laser pulse with a wavelength of 800 nm are shown in Fig. 5a. The normalized transmittance decreased as the perovskite sample approached the focal point of the lens (Z = 0), demonstrating a typical RSA response. At the focal position, the minimum normalized transmittance (Tmin) of the pristine and the ZnP1-, ZnP2-, ZnP3-, and ZnP4-passivated MAPbI3 films is 0.97, 0.85, 0.92, 0.77, and 0.93, respectively. All porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films feature enhanced RSA, i.e., lower Tmin values, which can be attributed to the passivation effect between the –COOH, –NH2 functional groups of porphyrins and the defects in perovskites. Through theoretically fitting the experimental results, the β values are calculated to be 6.09, 61.49, 25.92, 116.65, and 23.20 cm GW−1 for the pristine MAPbI3, MAPbI3/ZnP1, MAPbI3/ZnP2, MAPbI3/ZnP3, and MAPbI3/ZnP4 films, respectively, as listed in Table 1. It is noteworthy that the β values of MAPbI3/ZnP1 and MAPbI3/ZnP3 are one order of magnitude (∼10–20 folds) larger than those of the pristine MAPbI3 film and superior to those of reported typical semiconductor materials and similar perovskite materials (Table S1, ESI†), implying them as promising candidates for optical limiting application. The NLO response of the pristine and porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films was also activated under fs laser excitation at 515 nm. Fig. 5b and Table 1 depict their normalized transmittance curves and the corresponding β values. An increase in normalized transmittance was detected as the sample moved to the focal point, which is indicative of typical SA behavior. Compared with the pristine MAPbI3 film, the porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films still show superior SA behavior. The fitted calculated β values are −87.86, −168.89, −237.32, −162.93, and −157.42 cm GW−1 for the pristine MAPbI3, MAPbI3/ZnP1, MAPbI3/ZnP2, MAPbI3/ZnP3, and MAPbI3/ZnP4 films, respectively.

These measurement results demonstrate that the passivation of perovskite defects by porphyrins facilitates the enhancement of NLO performance, including RSA and SA behaviors. It is therefore necessary to probe into the NLO mechanism of this photophysical process under fs laser irradiation. According to the UV-Vis spectra, the band gap (Eg) of all perovskite films can be estimated by Tauc's equation, as depicted in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The calculated Eg values for the pristine and porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films range from 1.58–1.60 eV, while the pump laser at 800 nm has the photon energy (hν) equivalent to 1.55 eV. Since hν < Eg < 2hν, the electrons in the valence band (VB) of the perovskite cannot be directly excited to the conduction band (CB) through absorbing one photon. Nevertheless, they can simultaneously absorb two photons, i.e., the TPA process, and jump to the CB via a virtual state. This can excite more electrons to the CB (excited states), resulting in a decrease in the normalized transmittance (RSA behavior).69 However, the defects in the perovskite crystal lattice hinder the improvement of RSA. There is evidence that RSA behavior originating from TPA is related to the ground state dipole moment, and both the intrinsic states and surface states of materials are also perturbed and mediated by the ground state dipole moment.70,71 We speculate that defects induce the trap states in the pristine MAPbI3 film, which can rapidly capture the excited electrons, accordingly decreasing the photo-induced ground state dipole moment and inhibiting the TPA process. When porphyrin molecules were incorporated into the perovskite films, –COOH and –NH2 functional groups of porphyrins effectively passivate the defects via coordination interaction. The reduced density of trap states enhances the ground state dipole moment, resulting in higher TPA performance. In addition, porphyrins with favorable charge separation and extraction capabilities possess larger transition dipole moments under excitation,72 thus promoting the photo-induced electron/energy transfer between porphyrins and perovskites. Porphyrin monomers itself are good NLO materials owing to fast relaxation at high energy levels and long-lived excited state absorption. Consequently, these merits synergistically contribute to enhanced NLO properties of porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 film materials. Closed-aperture Z-scan measurements on the pristine and porphyrin-passivated perovskite films were also carried out to characterize their nonlinear refractive properties, and the results are presented in Fig. S8a (ESI†) and the corresponding nonlinear refractive index (n2) values are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). All film samples display typical “valley-peak” signals under the fs laser at 800 nm, indicating self-focusing effects. Porphyrin-passivated perovskite films exhibit enhanced nonlinear refraction performance compared with the pristine film, which may be ascribed to the increased free carrier absorption arising from the improved two-photon transition after passivation with porphyrins,73,74 which is consistent with the ultimately enhanced NLO absorption under this condition.
With the laser excitation expanded to 515 nm, the hν is equivalent to 2.41 eV. The Eg satisfies Eg < hν, and electrons generated by laser excitation are readily pumped from the VB to CB. When the laser input energy increases, more electrons are continuously transmitted to the CB, leading to a large number of excited state electrons at the edge of the CB. The CB has no abundant empty orbits to accommodate more excited electrons from the VB, further blocking the inter-band transition between the ground state and the excited state. As a result, the SA effect can be expected through the above-mentioned mechanism known as the band-filling effect (also called the Pauli blocking effect).73,75 The SA effect is weakened due to defects in the perovskite structure. During the process that the electrons are photoexcited to the CB, some of them are captured in the trap states and cannot jump to the CB. The increase in the available empty orbits in the CB forces the CB to reach the band-filling state harder, bringing about a lower SA response. In contrast, the porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films eliminate many trap states in the perovskite, which enables photogenerated electrons to get over trap states and jump to the CB. Empty orbitals that accommodate the excited state electrons in the CB are reduced, resulting in the enhancement of the SA response. The above interpretation also echoes the Z-scan results measured under fs laser irradiation (Fig. 5a and b), further confirming that the porphyrin passivation strategy plays a dominant role in the enhanced NLO absorption performance.
5. NLO properties at ns pulsed laser in different wavelengths
The open-aperture Z-scan measurement on the pristine and the ZnP1, ZnP2, ZnP3, and ZnP4-passivated MAPbI3 films was also carried out at pulsed laser conditions of 1064 and 532 nm with a 15 ns duration, and the NLO responses are illustrated in Fig. 6a and b. All perovskite films exhibited typical RSA behaviors under 1064 nm laser irradiation, and the fitted β values are summarized in Table 2. The hν is equivalent to 1.17 eV for the laser at 1064 nm, and the calculated Eg values also satisfy hν < Eg < 2hν. It should be emphasized that the TPA mechanism may not elucidate the above-mentioned RSA behaviors because the process that electrons in the VB synchronously absorb two photons and jump to the CB is fast, i.e., the time scale is usually on the order of fs. Furthermore, due to the easy generation of free carriers in semiconductors, large optical nonlinearities of free carriers can be excited under laser pulse irradiation. We thus infer that free carrier absorption can be the main contributor to the detected RSA response in the ns regime.73 The free carrier absorption is associated with the carrier concentration. On account of the defects in perovskites, some photogenerated carriers are trapped in the trap states, which reduces the carrier concentration. After the passivation of perovskite defects by porphyrins, the free carrier concentration increases, resulting in enhanced free carrier absorption capacities for the improvement of the RSA performance. These endow the porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films with outstanding β values, which are approximately 2–8 times higher than that of the pristine MAPbI3 film and exceed the β values of reported materials (Table S1, ESI†). Upon laser excitation at 532 nm, all perovskite films exhibited SA responses, and the β values of the porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films are larger than those of the pristine MAPbI3 film. Based on the Eg of the samples and the incident energy of the laser, we can deduce that the SA process can be dominated by the band-filling effect. The passivation of defects makes the electrons in the VB smoothly transition to the CB, thus rapidly reaching the band-filling state, forcing an increase in nonlinear transmittance for a stronger SA effect.76,77 On the other hand, photogenerated bound excitons are confined within the perovskite inorganic octahedral lattice slab after passivation, which could result in a large exciton binding energy in combination with the photoelectric field, leading to an enhanced SA response.78 Regarding the data in Table 2, the β values of MAPbI3/ZnP1 and MAPbI3/ZnP3 films are nearly two times larger than that of the pristine MAPbI3 film as well as higher than those of similar perovskite materials and some two-dimensional materials (Table S1, ESI†), exhibiting distinguished NLO absorption performance. Even if taking into account the scalability of the pulse width, synthetic perovskite materials in our work are still competitive,79 which are anticipated to be promising application candidates for constructing high-performance NLO devices. The nonlinear refraction properties of the film samples in the ns regime at 532 nm were also investigated. The enhancement in “valley-peak” signals (Fig. S8b, ESI†) and positive n2 values (Table S2, ESI†) were observed for porphyrin-passivated perovskite films compared with the pristine film, which can be attributed to the nonlinearity of free carriers.80 The porphyrin passivation effectively reduces perovskite defects and the loss of free carriers has been substantially suppressed. As a consequence, the modulation depth of light by free carriers is improved and thereby the nonlinear refraction performance is enhanced, which is also consistent with the open-aperture Z-scan results under the same conditions.

Interestingly, as seen in Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 5b and 6b, the β values of the as-prepared perovskite films at 532 nm ns pulse excitation are superior to those of at 515 nm fs pulse excitation, indicating that the films exhibit better SA properties under ns pulse excitation. The mechanism can be elucidated from the perspective of ground state absorption (GSA) and excited state absorption (ESA), based on the studies of the semiconductor band structure for modeling GSA and ESA.81–84 When the cross-section of ESA is smaller than that of GSA, its normalized transmittance would increase as the incident laser energy increases, displaying a SA behavior consistent with our observed results. The intraband relaxation time of the semiconductor material is either larger or shorter than the laser pulse width used, which will determine the magnitude of ESA and thereby determine the intensity of SA. It is reported that the intraband relaxation time of MAPbI3 perovskite materials is usually on the order of picoseconds.85 The laser pulse used (34 fs) is shorter than the intraband relaxation time of the perovskite, which is instantaneous, relative to the recovery of the excited carrier. Thus, the carriers in the excited state are more inclined to absorb the photon and transition to higher excited states, the probability of ESA increases, and the process of reaching the band-filling state is delayed, resulting in low SA performance. As for the ns laser, the laser pulse width used (15 ns) is larger than the intraband relaxation time of the perovskite. The excited carrier recovery can be completed immediately relative to the laser pulse time. Therefore, the overall excitation process is in a steady state and ESA is not easy to occur. With the increase of the incident laser intensity, the excited state carriers are continuously accumulated and the band-filling state is rapidly reached, thus showing strong SA performance.
To evaluate the stability of the perovskite films passivated by porphyrin derivatives, comparative measurements were conducted between pristine and porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 perovskite films without encapsulation both stored in ambient air with a relative humidity of 40% for 0 and 20 days. The XRD patterns aid in monitoring the degradation process of the perovskite samples, as shown in Fig. S9a (ESI†). In contrast to those of the fresh perovskite films (Fig. 1c), the XRD patterns of the ZnP1, ZnP2, ZnP3, and ZnP4-passivated MAPbI3 films exhibit comparatively lower PbI2 phase amounts, while the XRD pattern of pristine MAPbI3 films displays a larger content of the PbI2 phase, indicating less crystalline decomposition for porphyrin-passivated perovskite films. This indicates that the environmental stability of the perovskite film materials can be effectively enhanced by the introduction of porphyrin derivatives.28,86 The NLO properties of the perovskite films after 20 days are also measured, as shown in Fig. S9b (ESI†). The comparison of the corresponding β values of the perovskite films after 0 and 20 days is also listed in Fig. S9c (ESI†). As can be seen, the porphyrin-passivated MAPbI3 films have good stability with a less loss of about 3% to 8% in β values after exposure to ambient air with a relative humidity of 40% for 20 days. It is worth noting that a negligible NLO signal was detected in the pristine MAPbI3 film under the same conditions after 20 days of aging, indicating higher sensitivity of unpassivated perovskites to air and moisture, which results in dramatic losses in both the structure and NLO performance. Therefore, it can be concluded that the perovskite films passivated by porphyrin derivatives is quite stable under ambient conditions and the passivation effect is beneficial to the NLO performance of perovskite materials, which may provide a new paradigm for the assembly of versatile optoelectronic materials.
Conclusions
In summary, we have proposed a passivation strategy to optimize the NLO performance of perovskite materials via meticulously designing porphyrin molecules with amino or carboxyl groups as passivators and successfully constructed a series of porphyrin-modified MAPbI3 films. Porphyrin derivatives denoted as ZnP1–ZnP4 were introduced to passivate the defects in perovskites, which was confirmed by SEM, FTIR, XPS, and PL techniques. The –NH2 group in porphyrin fills the under-coordinated I− (due to the loss of MA+) in the perovskite, while the –COOH group forms coordination interaction with the under-coordinated Pb2+ (due to the loss of I−), realizing effective passivation. Benefiting from such passivation treatment, porphyrin-modified perovskite films exhibit enhanced NLO properties. The boosted RSA may be ascribed to the passivation effect that promotes the photo-induced ground state dipole moment and free carrier absorption, while the strengthened band-filling effect and large exciton binding energy derived from the passivation may give rise to the enhancement in SA. Other factors synergistically optimize their NLO properties, including the photo-induced electron/energy transfer between the porphyrin and perovskite, and the large transition dipole moment and charge separation in porphyrins. Besides, porphyrin-passivated perovskite films also show enhanced self-focusing nonlinear refractive responses with fs and ns pulse excitation, suggesting considerable potential applications for nonlinear refraction fields. Our study enriches the knowledge concerning defect-dependent NLO responses of perovskite materials and provides more possibilities to further improve the NLO performance of perovskite photonic devices utilizing porphyrin passivation strategies.
