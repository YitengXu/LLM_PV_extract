    , Accepted 18th April 2017First published on 25th April 2017AbstractThe interest in Na-ion batteries (NIBs) is growing exponentially since Na is more abundant and affordable than Li for large-scale energy storage applications. However, the lack of truly durable and high-capacity electrode materials still remains a key bottle-neck issue for the development of practical NIBs. In this work, we report the rational design of an ultra-long life anode material for NIBs by integrating the structural merits of hollow nanostructures, carbon nanocoating and amorphous structures together into a binary metal sulfide system. Amorphous CoSnSx nanoboxes sheathed in N-doped carbon are yielded by templating against single-crystalline CoSn(OH)6 nanoboxes, followed by polymer nanoplating and carbonization. The synergy of diverse structural features enables a robust structure and fast reaction kinetics for Na storage in the CoSnSx@NC anode, leading to an exceptionally long cycle life of 4000 cycles with very slow capacity loss (0.0075% per cycle) and high power output. The full cells assembled from the Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode and the CoSnSx@NC anode deliver a high energy density of up to 86.6 W h kg−1, as well as good capacity retention at high current rate.
1. Introduction
The surging demand for efficient yet low-cost renewable energy technologies boosts great interest in seeking a high-performance power source. Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are very appealing candidates towards this goal due to their high energy density, long calendar life and environmental benignity. However, the scarcity of Li resources (only 20 ppm in Earth's crust) offsets the potential of LIBs in large-scale energy applications such as power plants and electric grids with MWh-levels or above. Compared to Li, Na reserves are more abundant (2.83% in Earth's crust and 30.6% in the ocean) for the design of rechargeable Na-ion batteries (NIBs) with similar electrochemical properties but at a greatly reduced cost.1,2 This feature is particularly attractive for energy storage applications where the requirements on specific volumetric and gravimetric energy density are not a critical issue, for example, the electrical grid storage of solar or wind energy. Although the chemistry of Na intercalation is very similar to that of Li in terms of voltage, stability and diffusion barrier, many electrode materials (e.g., graphite, non-layered metal oxides) normally working in LIBs lose the activity towards Na storage due to the limited intercalation of Na with a higher ionization potential and larger ionic diameter (1.02 Å vs. 0.76 Å for Li).3,4 Hard carbon materials, metals (e.g., Sn, Sb) or elementary substances (e.g., P), tunnel-structured transitional metal oxides, fluoride-based materials and metal sulfides/oxides have been investigated as anode materials for NIBs, and found to deliver greatly enhanced performance in terms of insertion or conversion-type reactions.5–31 A major problem of these materials, however, is the drastic volume change when compared with the case in Li-intercalated electrodes upon repeated electrochemical cycling, which leads to severe electrode pulverization and a short cycle life for Na storage. The development of truly durable anode materials is still far from a satisfactory breakthrough for the construction of high-performance NIBs.
Because of the fundamental electrochemical origin, the mitigation of electrode pulverization is quite difficult in a single material system. One efficient strategy to improve the structural stability of the active materials is to pass them from bulk to delicate designed nanostructures such as hollow nanocages with a more exposed active surface and short diffusion pathway.32–37 In a hollow nanostructure, the presence of the interior provides extra room to tolerate the volume expansion associated with Na insertion into active materials. The nanoscale thin shells (usually tens of nanometers) further facilitate the fast solid-state diffusion of Na across an extremely reduced diffusion pathway. One step beyond is to further cushion the volume change of the active materials upon cycling by confining them into a flexible matrix of distinct material systems, for example, the flexible soft carbon.33,38–44 The presence of carbon matrix simultaneously prevents the nanostructures with high surface energy from aggregation and electrical isolation, thereby prolonging the cycle life of the electrode. Despite the appeal of these strategies, each design alone always leads to limited improvement in electrochemical properties, which hinders the development of truly durable electrodes for NIBs.
In this work, we report a new type of nanohybrid composed of amorphous binary metal sulfide hollow nanostructures with N-doped carbon sheath for highly reversible and ultralong-life Na storage. This unique design well integrates three main design principles to achieve excellent performance for Na storage. First, the atomically mixed system of binary metal sulfides with distinct electrochemical behavior may act as the buffer zone to mitigate the internal strain between each other, which efficiently relieves the electrode from the isotropic volume change upon cycling. The loose amorphous structure particularly facilitates the diffusion of Na ions with a large radius by enhancing the atomic/ionic mobility within the materials.45 In this sense, the atomically mixed matrix is advantageous over the mechanically mixed heterogeneous powders. Second, the hollow nanostructure could sufficiently tolerate the volume variation upon Na insertion/extraction by the presence of an interior structure, which simultaneously provides a large interfacial active area for fast Na diffusion across the shells with a nanoscale thickness. The hollow nanocage of amorphous CoSnSx with high capacity for Na storage is chosen to demonstrate our concept, which has been rarely reported. On this basis, the introduction of a robust N-doped conductive carbon sheath around the amorphous hollow nanostructures further reinforces them against particle aggregation and pulverization while enhancing the electrode conductivity. As a result, the N-doped carbon coated nanoboxes of amorphous cobalt–tin binary sulfides (denoted as CoSnSx@NC) exhibit an exceptionally long cycle life of 4000 cycles with very stable capacity retention as the anode material in NIBs. The asymmetric Na-ion full cells assembled from them and the Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode exhibit a high energy density of 86.6 W h kg−1 and good capacity retention for 100 cycles at high current rate.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of CoSnSx nanoboxes
The CoSn(OH)6 nanoboxes were first synthesized by the co-precipitation of Co2+ and Sn4+ in the presence of sodium citrate in alkaline solution, followed by etching with concentrated NaOH solution.41 Afterwards, the CoSn(OH)6 nanoboxes (20 mg) and thioacetamide (40 mg) were dispersed in an ethanol solution (30 mL) under ultrasonication. After thorough mixing, the suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and stored at 140 °C for 12 h. The resulting black product was harvested via several rinsing-centrifugation cycles with deionized water and ethanol before drying.
2.2 Synthesis of CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes
In a typical run, the CoSnSx nanoboxes (80 mg) and dopamine (200 mg) were dispersed into 100 mL of Tris-buffer solution (pH = 8.5) under stirring for 24 h, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 3 h in an N2 flow. By tuning the initial amount of dopamine used, the products with various carbon contents can be yielded by a similar approach. The polycrystalline CoS2–Sn2S3@NC nanoboxes can be also produced by annealing polydopamine-coated CoSnSx nanoboxes at higher temperature (e.g., 800 °C) in an N2 flow.
2.3 Material characterization
The morphology of the sample was characterized with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, QUANTA 450) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEITF30). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max 2400 type X-ray spectrometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The surface characteristics of the samples were investigated by using an ESCALAB MK II X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). The textural properties of the samples were measured by using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer at 77 K. Raman analysis were carried out on a Thermo Fisher Scientific DXR Raman Microscope using laser excitation at 532 nm. The weight ratio of Co, Sn, S and C elements in the sample was measured by coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Optima 2000DV, PerkinElmer, Inc.) and CHN element analysis (Vario EL cube).
2.4 Na-ion battery tests
The NIB tests were conducted using CR2016 coin cells with pure Na foil as the counter and reference electrode at room temperature. The working electrode consists of an active material, carbon black (Super P) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in a weight ratio of 7:2:1. The electrolyte used is 1.0 M NaPF6 in a 1:1 (w/w) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC). The mass loading of the electrodes is around 1.0 mg cm−2. Cell assembly was carried out in an Ar-filled glovebox with the concentration of moisture and oxygen below 1.0 ppm. The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed using a LAND CT2001A battery tester at varied current rates within a cut-off voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using a CHI 760E workstation by applying an AC amplitude of 5 mV over the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz.
For the assembly of the full cells, the cathode was made of the Na3V2(PO4)3/C composite, carbon black (Super P) and PVDF in a weight ratio of 7:2:1. The total mass loading of the cathode and anode is around 2.6 and 0.7 mg cm−2, respectively. The electrolyte used is 1.0 M NaPF6 in a 1:1 (w/w) mixture of EC and DEC with 5 wt% fluoro ethylene carbonate (FEC). The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests are carried out on a LAND CT2001A battery tester at different current densities within a cut-off voltage window of 0.5–3.9 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were conducted using a CHI 760D electrochemical workstation between 0.01 and 3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1.
3. Results and discussion
The synthesis strategy of CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes is straightforward, as schematically illustrated in Scheme 1. Single-crystal mesoporous CoSn(OH)6 nanoboxes are first synthesized via stoichiometric co-precipitation of Co2+ and Sn4+ in the presence of OH− and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K-30), followed by etching with concentrated NaOH solution at room temperature.46 A panoramic view of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveals the formation of uniform nanoboxes with an average edge length of around 150 nm and a shell thickness of 10–20 nm (Fig. 1a, d and g). They simultaneously act as the metal source and structural template to guide the formation of CoSnSx shells by the reaction with sulfide ions released from the hydrolysis of thioacetamide (TAA) under hydrothermal conditions. The conversion from CoSn(OH)6 to CoSnSx nanoboxes undergoes a topotactical transformation process without apparent collapse or fusion of the shells (Fig. 1b, e and g). The CoSnSx nanoboxes well duplicate the hollow structure of CoSn(OH)6 templates but the surface is relatively rough due to the formation of small nanosheets that nearly double the thickness of the original shells. The robust structure of CoSnSx nanoboxes provides the feasibility of exploiting nanoplating by controlled polymerization of dopamine around them and followed carbonization at relatively high temperature in an N2 flow. Afterwards, the entire surface of the nanoboxes is covered with a continuous overlayer of amorphous carbon with a uniform thickness of around 30–40 nm without damaging the hollow structure and amorphous texture of the nanoboxes. As a result of the significant shrinkage of polydopamine during carbonization, the carbon shell is tightly attached to the CoSnSx nanoboxes, which is beneficial to reinforce the stability and conductivity of the overall structure.

The homogenous distribution of Sn, Co and S elements in CoSnSx nanoboxes is identified by elemental mapping, as shown in Fig. 2a. The atomic ratio between Sn, Co and S elements is around 1:1.2:4.7. The crystallographic structure of CoSnSx nanoboxes is characterized by XRD analysis (Fig. 2b). It confirms the formation of an amorphous structure with a broad peak between 15 and 35° in a plain pattern. The signals from the single crystalline CoSn(OH)6 phase disappear entirely after complete sulfidation (Fig. S1†). No peaks belonging to the possible impurities such as cobalt oxides or SnO2 are detected. The XRD pattern of CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes shares a similar feature to that of amorphous CoSnSx nanoboxes, indicating that the amorphous texture of the nanoboxes is well reserved after carbon coating and annealing at 500 °C. The uniform distribution of Sn, Co, S and C elements in CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes is visualized by elemental mapping (Fig. S2†), while CoS2–Sn2S3@NC nanoboxes with a mixed crystalline structure are yielded upon annealing at higher temperature (e.g., 700 °C). The Raman analysis gives rise to a relatively low ratio between D and G bands in intensity (ID/IG = 0.93) due to the domination of disordered carbon in the sample (Fig. S3a†). The co-existence of Co, Sn, S, C and N elements in CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes is visualized by survey scan of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Fig. S3b.† The high-resolution Co 2p spectrum shows two characteristic peaks at 778.7 and 795.2 eV for 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 doublets of Co2+, respectively (Fig. 2c). The Sn 3d spectrum indicates the presence of Sn4+ as the 3d5/2 (486.7 eV) and Sn 3d3/2 (495.1 eV) doublet (Fig. 2d). The S 2p spectrum shows the formation of S 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 doublets at 162 and 163.3 eV with an energy separation of 1.3 eV and an intensity ratio of around 2:1 (Fig. S3c†), respectively. The S 2p signals of CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes shift negatively by around 1.8 eV with respect to pure sulfur, confirming the formation of metal-sulfur bonds. The N 1s region of the CoSnSx@NC sample exhibits three main contributions: the pyridinic N at 398.1 eV, the pyrrolic N at 399.6 eV and the graphitic N at 400.5 eV (Fig. 2e).47 The N content is measured to be 5.98 at% by XPS analysis. Benefitting from the hollow nanostructure, the CoSnSx nanoboxes exhibit a high Brunauer–Emmer–Teller (BET) specific surface area of ca. 100.5 m2 g−1. Despite the partial physical blocking of pores by surface coating, CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes can still retain a high specific surface area of ca. 75.2 m2 g−1 (Fig. 2f), which is favorable for fast accessibility of the particle to the electrolyte and ionic diffusion with respect to the bulk materials. The content of C, Co, Sn and S in the CoSnSx@NC sample is measured to be around 36.8 wt%, 14.89 wt%, 10.32 wt% and 32.06 wt%, measured by ICP-OES and CNH element analysis.

The electrochemical route of CoSnSx@NC electrodes towards Na storage is monitored by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests within a cut-off window of 0.01–3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. S4.† The irreversible cathodic peak at around 0.5 V at the first cycle is due to the irreversible process such as the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and the trap of the sodium in crystal lattice, which inevitably causes the initial capacity loss.48–50 In subsequent cycles, the cathodic/anodic peak pairs centered at around 0.02/0.08 V and 0.8/1.2 V are identified as a result of the reversible alloying/dealloying of Sn with Na and the conversion reaction of SnIVSx, respectively.28,38,49,51 The cathodic/anodic peak pairs centered at around 0.8/1.8 V is due to the conversion reaction between CoIISx and Na.16 Due to the atomically mixed amorphous texture of CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes, their CV peaks are not distinct like that of crystalline materials, which make it difficult to identify the accurate mechanism for Na storage in them. Nevertheless, the Na storage in CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes might be the result of coupled conversion-alloying reactions, described as follows, according to CV results: 2xNa + CoIISx ↔ xNa2S + Co(I) 2yNa + SnIVSy ↔ yNa2S + Sn(II) Sn + zNa ↔ NazSn(III)
Overall, the CV curves are superimposable after the initial cycle, indicating a high degree of reversibility of CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes for Na uptake. Fig. S5† shows the CV curves of CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes at various scan rates of 0.03–0.1 mV s−1. There is no linear correlation between the oxidation peak current and the scan rate, indicating the weak contribution of the pseudocapacitive process for Na storage in CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes.

Fig. 3a shows the representative discharge/charge voltage profiles of CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 within a cut-off voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V. The initial discharge and charge capacities are found to be 603 and 405 mA h g−1, respectively. The capacity loss of 32.8% at the initial cycle is the result of the irreversible processes such as electrolyte decomposition and inevitable formation of the SEI film below 1.0 V. The voltage curves show unobvious plateaus as compared to that of LIBs because of the large size, heavy mass and poor mobility of Na+, as well as the amorphous structure of CoSnSx@NC.26,52,53 From the second cycle onwards, the electrode show good cycle stability capacity with high capacities of over 300 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles with a high coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% (Fig. 3b). The shape of discharge and charge curves seems not to change much with deep cycling, indicative of high reversibility of Na storage in CoSnSx@NC. Even cycled at high current densities of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 A g−1, high capacities of 280, 260, 230 and 170 mA h g−1 can be still retained, indicating the excellent robustness of the electrode for Na storage (Fig. 3c). This rate capability can be further improved by using the NaCF3SO3/diglyme (DGM) electrolyte. In this case, high capacities of 270–440 mA h g−1 can be achieved at 0.1–5.0 A g−1, which are 40–60% higher than the values achieved in the NaPF6/EC:DEC electrolyte (Fig. S6†). For the evaluation of long-term cycle stability for Na storage, the electrodes are first cycled at a low current rate of 0.1 A g−1 for 10 cycles to activate the active materials. Remarkably, the CoSnSx@NC nanobox electrodes exhibit an ultra-long lifespan of over 4000 cycles at a high current density of 1.0 A g−1 with a stable capacity retention of over 70% since the 10th cycle. It corresponds to a very slow capacity loss of 0.0075% per cycle, rendering the exceptional durability for practical use (Fig. 3e). After deep cycling, a comparable capacity of 180 mA h g−1 is retained with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency, which is still nearly two-fold higher than that of the state-of-the-art cathode materials and is sufficient for the construction of high-energy NIBs. This performance is superior to many metal sulfide anodes recently reported for Na storage, as summarized in Table 1.

All the tests are conducted between 0.01 and 3.0 V.

To fully demonstrate the advantages of CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes for Na storage, the electrochemical performance of CoSnSx nanoboxes without carbon coating is investigated under identical test conditions, as shown in Fig. 3c. They lose almost all the capacities within tens of cycles and exhibit poor capacity retention at high current densities (Fig. 3c and e). Apparently, not only the structural stability, but also the Na storage kinetics of the CoSnSx are greatly enhanced by the protection of the robust and conductive carbon sheath that can alleviate electrode pulverization, preventing interparticle aggregation and enhance electrode conductivity.54 After deep cycling for over 4000 cycles, the original textural properties of CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes can be well retained in terms of shape, size, and structural integrity (Fig. S7†). The enhancement of the electrical conductivity by carbon coating is identified by much lower charge-transfer impedance (Rct) than that of the CoSnSx electrode, as characterized by the drastically reduced diameter of the semicircle in the high-frequency region in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) patterns (Fig. 3d). Although the polydopamine-derived carbon shells contribute to very low capacities (less than 15 mA h g−1), their content have a great influence on the electrochemical properties of CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes. Coating less amounts of carbon (e.g., 26.3 wt%) is insufficient to protect the nanoboxes from destruction during deep cycling, leading to prolonged but still short calendar life. An excess amount of carbon (e.g., 57.9 wt%) is undesirable because they are nearly inactive toward Na storage. On this basis, the doping of N heteroatoms in the carbon matrix may further enhance the activity towards Na storage by introducing a large number of topological defects into the carbon structure, which acts as extra active sites for Na uptake. After discharging and charging, the amorphous texture of CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes remains without apparent change (Fig. S8†). Distinct from the crystalline structure, the amorphous structure with an isotropic loose texture and high atomic/ionic mobility is favorable to accelerate the diffusion of Na+, reduce the anisotropic volume change of nanostructures and provide extra sites for Na storage. As a result, the amorphous CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes could exhibit superior capacity retention than the crystalline CoS2–Sn2S3@NC nanoboxes with similar shape, size and carbon contents.
Prompted by the excellent performance of CoSnSx@NC nanoboxes, they are evaluated as the anode material to assemble the full cells with the Na3V2(PO4)3/C (denoted as NVP/C) cathode. The SEM and XRD analysis confirm the high phase purity of NVP/C nanocomposites. They exhibit a stable plateau at 3.4 V and deliver capacities of 94, 92, 88, 79, 70 and 59 mA h g−1 at varied current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 A g−1, as well as stable capacity retention for 300 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 in half cells (Fig. S9 and S10†). The NPV/C is used for assembling the full cell with CoSnSx@NC at a mass ratio of around 3.7:1. The CoSnSx@NC//NVP/C full cells are thus anode limited, giving rise to a high average potential of approximately 2.6 V and the capacities of around 270 mA h g−1 between 0.5 and 3.9 V at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. A high energy density of around 86.6 W h kg−1 can be achieved on the basis of the total cathode and anode mass. When cycled at varied current rates of 0.4, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 A g−1, comparable capacities of 250, 210, 185, 165, 150 and 135 mA h g−1 can still be achieved. To further study the long-term cycling performance, the CoSnSx@NC//NVP/C full cells are evaluated at 0.5 and 1.0 A g−1. They exhibit a stable capacity retention of over 73% for 100 discharging–charging cycles with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency except for the initial several cycles, which makes them suitable to serve as an energy storage device for practical use. As a demonstration, a light-emitting diode (LED) array panel (11 × 44 diodes) is lighted by connecting coin-type CoSnSx@NC//NVP/C full cells, as shown in Fig. 4d.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a templating strategy has been developed for facile synthesis of N-doped carbon sheathed amorphous binary metal sulfide hollow nanostructures for reversible and long-life Na storage. The products feature amorphous CoSnSx nanoboxes uniformly coated with a thin layer of an N-doped carbon shell. The synergistic effect originated from the multicomponent amorphous structure, carbon nanocoating, heteroatom doping and hollow nanostructure provides greatly enhanced conductivity, Na diffusion kinetics and structural stability for Na uptake in binary cobalt–tin sulfides. As a result, exceptional electrochemical performance could be achieved when they are evaluated as the anode materials in NIBs, as characterized by an ultra-long cycle life of 4000 cycles with high capacities and significantly enhanced power output of up to 5 A g−1. The CoSnSx@NC//Na3V2(PO4)3/C full cells exhibit a high energy density of 86.6 W h kg−1 and stable capacity retention with high coulombic efficiency for 200 cycles at high current rate. With rational and delicate design, this class of functional materials may hold great promise for the development of high-performance NIBs.
