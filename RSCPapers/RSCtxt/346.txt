A correlation between the electron donating abilities of the derived iminodibenzyl group and CT was built to evaluate the cell performance based on sensitizers Dye1–Dye6. The theoretical studies showed that porphyrins Dye1–Dye3 bearing an extremely strong electron-donating group (EDG) would fail in the generation of photocurrent in the closed circuit when applied in DSSCs due to the higher level of the HOMO energy than the redox potential of the redox couple (I−/I3−). The one with a weaker EDG (Dye4) is expected to show better photovoltaic performance than porphyrin IDB with an unsubstituted iminodibenzyl group. This study demonstrates a reliable method involving the employment of the Fukui function, the extended condensed Fukui function and the Tangui Le Bahers model for the evaluation of newly designed D–π–A type porphyrin sensitizers for use in DSSCs, and as guidance for future molecular design.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been widely regarded as promising candidates for new generation photovoltaic devices to provide electricity since O’Regan and Gräzel published their pioneering work in 1991.1 According to the principle of DSSCs, when a DSSC is illuminated with light, the electrons in the ground state of the dye are energized to higher-energy excited states. The excited electrons are injected into the TiO2 conduction band (CB) and the oxidized dye sensitizers are regenerated by taking electrons from the redox couple in the electrolyte. Therefore, as key components in DSSCs, dye molecules play an important role in determining the corresponding cell performance.2,3
Specifically, Gouterman4 thought that dye excitation mainly involved the excitations among HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO+1. The photo-excited dyes may decay to the ground state. A long lifetime of the excited electron is favorable for efficient electron injection, which can lead to high open-circuit voltage (Voc).5 The recombination reactions between the dye cation and the injected electrons as well as between the electrolyte and the excited electrons are the principal side reactions that occur inside the cell, leading to the loss of photo-electrons.
It is well known that a good alignment of the energy level is crucial for cell performance. In order to enhance the light-harvesting ability and increase cell performance, one effective way is to narrow the HOMO–LUMO gap by extending the π-conjugation of the molecules. However, the LUMO of the excited state has to lie above the bottom edge of the conduction band of the semiconductor so that the injection of electrons into the CB is thermodynamically favorable. The HOMO of the photo-oxidized dyes has to be below the redox potential of the redox couple so that dyes can be regenerated by taking electrons from the redox couple.6,7
At present, the “push–pull” type molecules, which are made up of electron-donor groups (EDGs) and electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs), connected with π-conjugated spacers (π-bridges) are quite popular for the fabrication of a high performance cell. Porphyrin derivatives have drawn considerable attention for use as sensitizers in DSSCs due to their vital roles in natural photosynthetic systems and strong absorption in the visible region, as well as readily tunable optical, photophysical and electrochemical properties by peripheral substitutions.3,8,9 For example, in 2014, Yella10 synthesized a “push–pull” type zinc porphyrin dye (SM315) featuring a D–π–A structure, based on which the solar cell exhibits a remarkably high power conversion efficiency (η) value of up to 13% using a cobalt-based redox electrolyte. By using a co-sensitization strategy, the η value reached 14.7%,11 which is a new milestone achieved in the DSSC field.
In the design of efficient sensitizers for use in DSSCs, it is vital to introduce suitable donor and acceptor groups to modulate molecular energy levels.12 For example, Xie13,14 designed and synthesized porphyrin sensitizers with the EDGs or EWGs systematically varying and investigated their effects on the cell performance. Recently, in our continuous efforts to develop high performance porphyrin sensitizers for use in DSSCs, we synthesized three D–π–A zinc porphyrin molecules bearing different diarylamino groups such as diphenylamine (DPA), iminodibenzyl (IDB) and iminostilbene (ISB) as electron pushing groups, and benzo cyanoacrylic acid as a π-spacer and an electron acceptor (Fig. 1).15 The corresponding cell performances were measured and the molecules were further investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and time-dependent functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. It was shown that the best cell performance is achieved by a porphyrin IDB-sensitized solar cell.15 By further comparing the computational results with experimental ones,15 we speculate that the porphyrins with stronger EDGs have better cell performance. Thus, on the basis of the structure of the best performance porphyrin (IDB), we designed a series of new porphyrins. The electron-donating abilities of the meso-diarylamino group (iminodibenzyl) vary distinctly by introducing either a strong or medium EDG or an EWG into the two benzo rings of the iminodibenzyl substituent para to the amino atom. Compared to porphyrin IDB, those porphyrins containing the diphenyl/dialkylamino group (Dye1 and Dye2), alkoxyl chain (Dye3) or alkyl group (Dye4) in the iminodibenzyl substituent are expected to have stronger electron-pushing abilities at the porphyrin meso position, which should facilitate the intramolecular transfer of the photo-generated electrons to the acceptor via a π bridge, and to a certain extent enhance the performance of the corresponding porphyrin-based DSSCs. On the other hand, those with electron-drawing substituents present in the iminodibenzyl group such as fluorine atoms (Dye5) or cyano groups (Dye6) show a decrease in the cell performance due to the smaller electron-pushing abilities of the derived iminodibenzyl group. In this study, the reliability of the computational method including the employment of the functions and basis sets during the computation was first analyzed based on our previous experimental studies on porphyrins DPA, IDB and ISB, which then can be used to evaluate the performance of the newly designed porphyrin sensitizers Dye1–Dye6. The definitions of the condensed Fukui function were extended to evaluate the electron donating abilities of the diarylamino groups accurately at the quantitative level. The Tangui Le Bahers model was adopted to analyze charge transfer (CT) during electron transition. The correlation between the electron donating abilities of EDGs and CT was built to evaluate the photovoltaic properties of Dye1–Dye6 in DSSCs. Interestingly, based on theoretical studies it is found that porphyrins bearing a strong EDG failed in the generation of photocurrent in the closed circuit when applied in DSSCs, since the HOMO energy level is higher than the redox potential of the redox couple (I−/I3−). The one with a weaker EDG (Dye4) is expected to show better photovoltaic performance than porphyrin IDB with an unsubstituted iminodibenzyl group. The employment of the Fukui function, the extended condensed Fukui function and the Tangui Le Bahers model provided a method for the evaluation of newly designed D–π–A type porphyrin sensitizers for use in DSSCs, and as guidance for the future molecular design.

2. Methodology
2.1 Parameters evaluating sensitizers
As is well known, the overall η, which is the most important measurement index for a solar cell, is given by the photocurrent density measured at short-circuit (Jsc), the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), the fill factor of the cell (FF), and the intensity of the incident light (Pin), (1)
2.2 Frontier molecular orbital
According to the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory,16 many properties of molecules are determined by the frontier molecular orbitals, such as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) as well as the HOMO−1 orbital, the LUMO+1 orbital and so on.
The FMO theory is easy to understand and visualize. However it is not accurate enough when evaluating the electron donating abilities at the quantitative level. So we adopt the important concepts, namely the Fukui function and the condensed Fukui function to describe the electron donating abilities accurately at the quantitative level.
2.3 Fukui function and condensed Fukui function
As an important concept in conceptual density functional theory, the Fukui function has been widely used in the prediction of the reactive site. The Fukui function is defined as:17 (2)where N is the number of electrons in the present system and the constant term v in the partial derivative is the external potential. Generally the external potential only comes from nuclear charges, and thus v can be seen as a nuclear coordinate for an isolated chemical system. The partial derivative cannot be directly evaluated due to the discontinuity when N is an integer. To resolve this difficulty, the Fukui function is defined using one-sided derivatives.18
Nucleophilic attack: (3)Electrophilic attack: (4)Radical attack: (5) When a molecule accepts electrons, the electrons tend to go to places where f+(r) is large because it is at these locations that the molecule is most able to stabilize additional electrons. Therefore a molecule is susceptible to nucleophilic attack at sites where f+(r) is large. Similarly, a molecule is susceptible to electrophilic attack at sites where f−(r) is large, this is because these are the regions where electron removal destabilizes the molecule the least. Therefore, as porphyrin has stronger EDGs, there is a larger value of f−(r) at EDGs which lose electrons easier.
The Fukui function is a real space function, which is commonly studied by means of visualization of the iso-surface. In order to achieve quantitative comparison between different sites, one can calculate the condensed Fukui function based on atomic charges. In the condensed version, the atomic population number is used to represent the amount of electron density distribution around an atom. The definition of the condensed Fukui function for an atom, say A, can be written as:19
Nucleophilic attack: fA+ = qAN − qAN+1(6)Electrophilic attack: fA− = qAN−1 − qAN(7)Radical attack: f0A = (qAN−1 − qAN+1)/2(8)Specifically, qA is the atomic charge. We adopted a widely used population method (Hirshfeld population analysis) to evaluate the atomic charges using software Multiwfn 3.3.6. The advantages of the Hirshfeld population are evident, whose applicability is not constrained by the type of wave function and is insensitive to the quality of the wave function. Besides, the atom-condensed Hirshfeld Fukui functions tend to be nonnegative. Oláh20 illustrated how Hirshfeld charge is successfully used to study the reactive site by means of the condensed Fukui function.
Furthermore, we extended the definition of condensed Fukui for an atom (say A) to a functional group (say M), which is written as:
Nucleophilic attack: (9)Electrophilic attack: (10)Radical attack: (11)
2.4 Charge transfer dipole moment (μCT)
Tangui Le Bahers21 proposed a method for analyzing charge-transfer (CT) during electron transition. The electron density variation between the excited state (EX) and the ground state (GS) is: Δρ(r) = ρEX(r) − ρGS(r)(12) It should be noticed that the geometry used in calculating ρEX(r) and ρGS(r) must be identical, otherwise the resulting Δρ(r) is meaningless. The Δρ(r) value can be divided into positive and negative parts, namely ρ+(r) and ρ−(r). Of course, the integral of ρ+(r) and ρ−(r) should be equal, and if evident inequality is observed, that means the error in the numerical integral is unneglectable, and a denser grid is required. Even though what was analyzed is single-electron excitation, the magnitude of ρ+(r) and ρ−(r) as well as their integrals can also be theoretically larger than 1.0 as the excitation of an electron leads to a distribution reorganization of the remaining electrons, which also contribute to Δρ(r).22
The transferred charge qCT is the magnitude of the integral of ρ+(r) and ρ−(r). The barycenters of positive and negative parts can be computed as (13) (14)
The component coordinates of R+ will be referred to as X+, Y+, Z+, and of R− as X−, Y−, Z−. The distance between the two barycenters determines the CT length. DCT,X = |X+ − X−| DCT,Y = |Y+ − Y−| DCT,Z = |Z+ − Z−|(15) The dipole moment variation caused by CT is evaluated as μCT,X = (X+ − X−)qCT, μCT,Y = (Y+ − Y−)qCT, μCT,Z = (Z+ − Z−)qCT(16)
2.5 Computational details
All ground state (GS) molecules were optimized using the B3LYP function with the 6-31g(d,p) basis set. With the identical geometries, we calculated the excited states (EXs) using the BP86 function with the 6-31+g(d,p) basis set, since the hybrid method B3LYP always overestimates the transition energy according to the literature,23 and BP86 is well consistent with the experimental results.23 A conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM) is used to simulate the environment of ethanol when conducting GS and EX calculations.24
To prove reliability, Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation (PBE0), CAM-B3LYP and LC-wPBE for long range exchange–correlation24 are also employed to calculate the ground states of molecules DPA, IDB, and ISB for comparison with the “more suitable function” B3LYP and experimental results. As for the reliability of excited state computation, we compared the computed transitions with the absorption peak in experimental UV-Vis absorption spectra as another diagnostic tool.25
All the above calculations are performed using Gaussian 09 software package.26 The calculations concerning the Fukui function, the condensed Fukui function and charge transfer indices were performed using Multiwfn software.19,27
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Analysis of the reliability of computed results
The first step in the calculations is to get the correct ground geometries of the dyes. Three molecules (DPA, IDB and ISB), which have been synthesized and examined previously, are employed to evaluate the computation method. It is found that B3LYP is more suitable than PBE0, CAM-B3LYP and LC-wPBE for computation by comparing the calculated HOMOs and LUMOs with experimental values (Table 1). It is clear that the calculated HOMOs and LUMOs using B3LYP are closer to the experimental results than using other functions.

To determine the reliability of BP86 functions for the excited state calculations, molecules DPA, IDB and ISB are again employed as examples. From Table 2, it can be observed that there is an acceptable difference of less than 20 nm when comparing the calculated absorption peaks with experimental values. Fig. 3 shows that the experimental UV-Vis absorption spectra almost coincide with the calculated excited states. Therefore, BP86 functions are employed to calculate all excited states of the newly designed molecules.

3.2 Porphyrin with different electron-donating groups (D)—DPA, IDB, and ISB
According to our experimental efficiency (η) results15 of DPA-, IDB- and ISB-sensitized solar cells, IDB (5.26%) is higher than DPA (4.05%) and ISB is the lowest (2.62%). So are the Jsc and Voc values, i.e.IDB (9.68 mA cm−2, 740 mV) is larger than DPA (7.45 mA cm−2, 730 mV), and ISB is the smallest (6.43 mA cm−2, 660 mV) (Table 3).

The different cell performance should be caused by the different diarylamino groups. In order to analyze and compare their electron-donating abilities, the Fukui function and the extensive condensed Fukui function of different diarylamino groups (fM−) were calculated. Fig. 4 is the visualization of the Fukui function. The extended condensed Fukui function (fM−) is calculated to be 0.3709, 0.4765 and 0.1396 for DPA, IDB and ISB, respectively. It can be seen that iminodibenzyl is the strongest electron-donating group with the largest fM− and iminostilbene is the weakest. The different electron-donating abilities of the diarylamino group can have a significant influence on charge transfer.

Table 4 shows that the charge transfer distance (DCT), transferred charge (qCT), and dipole moment variation (μCT) increase in the order ISB < DPA < IDB. Thus, on the basis of Tangui Le Bahers model,21 the electron lifetime (τe) is to increase in the order ISB < DPA < IDB. As a result, IDB has a more efficient charge transfer which contributes to the greater values of Jsc and Voc of the IDB-sensitized cell compared to those of ISB- and DPA-based cells with ISB showing the worst cell performance. Overall, it is believed that the strong electron-donating ability of the iminodibenzyl group facilitates CT of IDB and boosts its cell performance significantly.

3.3 A series of newly designed porphyrins with different electron-donating groups (D)—Dye1–Dye6
To further evaluate the reliability of the method of the extended condensed Fukui function in predicting the photovoltaic properties of the sensitizers, a series of new structures based on porphyrin IDB were designed (Fig. 2). The electron-donating abilities of iminodibenzyl vary significantly by introducing different EDGs or EWGs into the two benzo rings of the iminodibenzyl substituent para to the amino atom as shown in Fig. 2. By theoretical calculations, correlation between the extended condensed Fukui function values of the newly designed porphyrins with their calculated photovoltaic properties such as the CT parameters like μCT as mentioned above can be established. Furthermore, the molecule which should potentially lead to the best cell performance can be determined. The methodology based on the theoretical calculation developed here should provide a valuable guide for the experimental synthesis and future molecular design for a high performance sensitizer.
3.4 Extended Fukui function of donors (Dye1–Dye6)

Table 5 shows the results of the extended condensed Fukui function (fM−) of different iminodibenzyl substituents in molecules Dye1–Dye6. It is clear that the electron-donating abilities of the iminodibenzyl substituent decrease in the order Dye1 > Dye2 > Dye3 > Dye4 > IDB > ≈ Dye5 > Dye6. Thus, among the newly designed molecules, Dye1 and Dye2 have EDGs with strongest electron-donating ability, while porphyrins Dye3 and Dye4 contain relatively strong donors compared to IDB. In contrast, the donor of Dye6 has relatively weak electron-donating ability compared to IDB. Compared to the hydrogen in IDB, it can be seen that the results are in accord with the electron-donating/electron-withdrawing abilities of the introduced substituent among the newly designed porphyrins except for Dye5. Interestingly, for Dye5 with two strong electron-drawing fluorine atoms introduced into the benzo rings of the iminodibenzyl group in the porphyrin IDB, the extended condensed Fukui function (fM−) remains almost unchanged (0.4743 for Dye5vs. 0.4765 for IDB). This actually can be attributed to the p–π conjugated effect28 due to the presence of the electron lone pairs outside the fluorine atom, which weakens the electron-withdrawing abilities of fluorine.

3.5 Frontier molecule orbital theory and analysis of the energy level (Dye1–Dye6)
Surprisingly, it is found that based on the calculated energy level alignments shown in Fig. 5, the HOMO energy levels of porphyrins Dye1, Dye2 and Dye3 lie above the redox potential of the redox couple (I−/I3−). Thus, it can be determined that Dye1, Dye2 and Dye3 are not suitable to be used in DSSCs. The corresponding photo-oxidized dyes cannot be reduced by the redox couple to their ground states. Dye4–Dye6 have valid energy level alignment. More specifically, Dye4 has a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap than IDB which should facilitate sunlight absorption by red-shifting light absorption and be beneficial for the enhancement of efficiency (η).
 Fig. 5  The calculated energy level alignments of Dye1–Dye6 and IDB, using the B3LYP function with the 6-31+g(d,p) basis set and the C-PCM solvent model (solvent = ethanol). 
The above results suggested that the additional EDG can have a critical influence on the HOMO energy levels of the D–π–A, which will determine the driving force for the regeneration of the oxidized dye molecules by the redox couple. Namely, the extremely strong EDG will make the HOMO of a dye lie above the potential of the redox couple which makes the regeneration of an oxidized dye thermodynamically unfavorable, resulting in a failed circuit current. On the precondition of obtaining valid alignment of the energy level, which means that the regeneration of an oxidized dye molecule is thermodynamically feasible, a stronger EDG is conducive to the narrow HOMO–LUMO gap and should harvest more sunlight energy.
3.6 Charge transfer dipole moment (μCT) of Dye4–Dye6
Next, to correlate the Fukui function value with the photovoltaic properties of the molecules, we analyzed CT during electron transition occurring in valid molecules Dye4–Dye6. Among the three CT indices (DCT, qCT and μCT), CT dipole moment is the most important index which is the product of DCT and qCT. Table 6 shows that μCT decreases in the order Dye4 > IDB > Dye5 > Dye6. Thus on the basis of Tangui Le Bahers21 model, the electron lifetime (τe) will also decrease in the order Dye4 > IDB > Dye5 > Dye6. The results suggested that porphyrin Dye4 may have a more efficient charge transfer than IDB leading to a better cell performance due to the stronger electron-donor present in Dye4.

4. Conclusions
The correlation between the electron donating abilities of the derived iminodibenzyl group and CT was built to evaluate the cell performance on the basis of Dye1–Dye6. The porphyrins bearing extremely strong EDGs like Dye1–Dye3 are not suitable to be used as sensitizers in DSSCs because they would fail in the generation of photocurrent due to the higher level of the HOMO energy than the redox potential of the redox couple (I−/I3−). The one with a medium EDG (Dye4) has a valid energy level alignment with a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap than porphyrin IDB with an unsubstituted iminodibenzyl group, resulting in a better CT computation result. Therefore Dye4 is expected to show better photovoltaic performance than IDB. Our theoretical studies demonstrate that the Fukui function and the extended condensed Fukui function are in accord with the electron-donating abilities of EDGs. The Tangui Le Bahers model can be adopted to analyze porphyrins’ CT during electron transition. In summary, the reliable method involving the employment of the Fukui function, the extended condensed Fukui function and the Tangui Le Bahers model can be used for screening D–π–A type porphyrin sensitizers for use in DSSCs and as guidance for the future molecular design.
