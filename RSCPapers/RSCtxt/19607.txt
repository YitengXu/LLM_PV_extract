    , Accepted 4th March 2014First published on 7th March 2014AbstractFormation of a selective emitter in crystalline silicon solar cells improves photovoltaic conversion efficiency by decoupling emitter regions for light absorption (moderately doped) and metallization (degenerately doped). However, use of a selective emitter in silicon nanowire (Si NW) solar cells is technologically challenging because of difficulties in forming robust Ohmic contacts that interface directly with the top-ends of nanowires. Here we describe a self-aligned selective emitter successfully integrated into an antireflective Si NW solar cell. By one-step metal-assisted chemical etching, NW arrays formed only at light-absorbing areas between top-metal grids while selectively retaining Ohmic contact regions underneath the metal grids. We observed a remarkable ∼40% enhancement in blue responses of internal quantum efficiency, corresponding to a conversion efficiency of 12.8% in comparison to the 8.05% of a conventional NW solar cell.
Introduction
Silicon nanowires (Si NWs) are considered candidates for next-generation solar cells because of their strong broadband optical absorptance despite reduced silicon usage.1–17 However, the experimental conversion efficiencies reported to date for Si wire solar cells are much lower than the estimated theoretical efficiency.16 One major hurdle is the difficulty in forming a robust, Ohmic front electrode directly over the wire arrays. Non-Ohmic contacts formed between top-electrodes and a wire array increase series resistance while decreasing the fill factor (FF).5,15 In addition, a high surface-to-volume ratio of NWs increases the doping concentration (Nd) inside the NWs during thermal doping, so that the degenerately doped NW emitter acts as a metal-like conductive layer, causing high Auger and Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination loss. As a result, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) decreases due to increased surface recombination of charge carriers,18 and the short-circuit current density (Jsc) is also decreased due to degraded blue responses by loss of high-energy photons.
Integration of selective-emitter technology into Si NW solar cells can improve cell efficiency by decoupling the degenerately doped (1020 to 1021 cm−3) contact region from the lightly doped (1018 to 1019 cm−3) emitter region for photon collection.19 Reduced recombination by a lightly doped emitter results in higher Voc and Jsc values and lowers the collection losses of photogenerated carriers. Although the conventional selective-emitter process in crystalline Si solar cells requires multiple doping steps with photomask alignments,20–22 we developed a facile etch-back approach to integrate a self-aligned selective emitter onto a degenerately doped, Si NW solar cell. Robust Ohmic contacts integrated with lightly doped antireflective Si NWs were obtained using one-step thermal diffusion. Our selective-emitter-NW solar cells had a conversion efficiency of 12.8% due to a low contact resistance of 3.03 mΩ cm2 as well as a high Jsc value of 33.65 mA cm−2. In particular, blue responses showed a remarkable enhancement of ∼40% due to improvement of internal quantum efficiency (IQE), indicating efficient collection of charge carriers photogenerated in the NWs. In addition, the considerable enhancement in IQE over broadband wavelengths implies that superior light trapping by Si NWs combined synergistically with efficient carrier collection by the selective-emitter structure.
Results and discussion
The essential features required to fabricate selective-emitter NW solar cells are illustrated in Fig. 1. We used one-step metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) to form moderately doped NWs at the low-doped bottom side of a planar n-doped emitter, while removing degenerately doped, top-ends of the original NWs. Self-aligned, degenerately doped regions remained underneath the metal grids for the formation of Ohmic contacts. Phosphorus doping was then performed using a spin-on-doping technique to form p–n junctions. The depth of the p–n junctions was estimated to be ∼0.6 μm from the surface, and the surface dopant concentration was measured to be ∼1021 cm−3 based on the secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) profile plotted in Fig. 1a. Front metal grids of Ti and Au were prepared simply using a mask evaporation technique. After metallization, antireflective Si NWs were prepared using MACE on emitter regions exposed between metal grids. As shown in Fig. 1b, one-step MACE yielded a selective-emitter structure consisting of lightly doped NWs and Ohmic contacts, because the degenerately doped top-ends of NWs positioned in-between the metal grids were selectively removed during MACE.

(b) MACE results in the formation of moderately doped Si NWs in the light absorbing area while leaving metal electrodes on top of the degenerately doped Si NWs. 
According to the localized galvanic cell model,23,24 the MACE mechanism involves a microscopic electrochemical process in which Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as a catalyst promote a cathodic reaction (reduction of H2O2) as well as an anodic reaction (oxidation of Si). In aqueous H2O2–HF solution, local oxidation of Si occurs underneath the Ag NPs; then, the oxidized Si is dissolved by HF (reaction (1) in Fig. 2a). With increasing etching time, Si can adopt a wirelike morphology because of further penetration of Ag NPs into the Si bulk. Meanwhile, Ag+ ions can be created by the oxidation of Ag NPs by H2O2 at the interface between Si and the Ag NPs (reaction (2)):25,26 Si + H2O2 + 6HF → 2H2O + H2SiF6 + H2(1) 2Ag + H2O2 + 2H+ → 2Ag+ + 2H2O(2) Si + 4Ag+ + 6F− → 4Ag + SiF62−(3)

(d) Lengths of selective-emitter-NWs (LNW, dotted line) and bulk Si etching (Lbulk, solid lines) are plotted as a function of etching time, for H2O2 concentrations [H2O2] of 0. 015 (red), 0.045 (black), and 0.18 (blue) M. 
These Ag+ ions are normally reduced back to Ag NPs by attracting electrons, because the Si-adherent Ag NPs have a higher electronegativity than Si.27 Ag+ ions are likely confined in close proximity to Ag NPs, resulting in the presence of Ag NPs confined to the original sites. To etch degenerately doped Si, however, some of the Ag+ ions are able to preferentially nucleate tiny Ag NPs onto defective sites where the energy barrier for redox reactions is lower, rather than being confined to the original sites of Ag NPs. This feature was revealed by the presence of tiny Ag NPs creating new lateral etching pathways, which increased the surface roughness and porosity as well (reaction (3)).28 As a result, the heavily doped, top-regions of NWs become morphologically rough and porous (Fig. 2b and c and ESI Fig. S1†). Highly porous Si around the NW tips could be quickly removed by H2O2–HF solution, leading to an empty space (Lbulk) in the light absorption region shown in Fig. 2b.

Fig. 2d shows how the NW length (LNW) of the selective emitter and bulk Si etching (Lbulk) can be controlled as a function of etching time in various H2O2 concentrations. MACE can be used to obtain selective-emitter NWs while removing degenerately doped regions. The NW length increased linearly with etching time (dotted line); however, Lbulk in 0.045 M H2O2 solution was normally saturated at a depth of ∼150 nm (black line), which was degenerately doped with ≥5 × 1019 cm−3 of P. We adjusted the amount of bulk Si etching by varying the H2O2 concentration in the HF–H2O2 solution. A high H2O2 concentration (i.e., 0.18 M, blue line) resulted in the generation of more Ag+ ions and tiny Ag NPs due to oxidation of Ag such that the extent of porous Si and bulk Si etching was higher in the relatively low-doped Si sample than that obtained using a lower H2O2 concentration (0. 015 M, red line). As a result, Lbulk increased with increasing H2O2 concentration, as shown in Fig. 2d.
The reflectance (Ravg in the inset of Fig. 3a), wavelength-averaged over the main spectral range from 400 to 1000 nm, decreased from ∼38.5% to ∼2.7% with increasing etching time up to 2 min. This superior anti-reflectance originated mainly from improved matching of the optical impedance of air and bulk Si due to the presence of Si NWs.12 Enhanced light absorptance increased Jsc in selective-emitter-NW cells (J−V curves in Fig. 3a); however, the best cell was obtained from the sample which has been etched for 1 minute only, not from the 2 min etched cell that had the highest light absorptance (lowest Ravg). We recorded a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 12.89% for our best cell, along with Voc, Jsc, and FF values of 555 mV, 33.65 mA cm−2, and 68.6%, respectively. Voc and FF values initially tended to increase with etching time up to 0.5 min, but then decreased (1–2 min). The improved Voc was due to the suppression of Auger recombination by removal of degenerately doped Si, despite the increase in surface recombination and surface area for 0.5 min etching. Increasing the etching time to longer than 0.5 min, however, decreased Voc because surface recombination aggravated by longer NWs governed device performance. Reverse saturation current density (J0) extracted from the illuminated J−V curves29 is plotted in Fig. 3b. The 0.5 min etched cell had the lowest J0 value (highest Voc), implying an optimized recombination state by the following relationship between J0 and Voc:  where q, kB, T, and JL represent electron charge, Boltzmann's constant, temperature, and light-generated current, respectively. FF values also decreased with increasing NW length (i.e., increasing etching time, Fig. 3c) because the doping concentration inside the longer NWs further decreased such that series and emitter sheet resistances all increased.

The inset shows the average reflectance (Ravg), which is spectrally weighted over the wavelengths of 400–1000 nm. (b) Reverse saturation current density (J0, black) and open-circuit voltage (Voc, red) extracted from the J−V curves plotted in panel a. (c) Jsc (blue), FF (red), and the conversion efficiency (green) of selective-emitter-NW solar cells are plotted as a function of etching time. (d) EQEs with different etching times; 0 (black), 0.5 (red), 1 (blue) and 2 (green) min. 
The typical series resistance of standard solar cells is ∼2 Ω cm2;30 in contrast, that of the 2 min-etched cell was ∼4.8 Ω cm2. As a result, FF values decreased from 72 to 53% with increasing etching time from 0.5 to 2 min. Although excellent Voc and FF values were obtained for the 0.5 min etched cell, the best conversion efficiency was recorded for the 1 min etched cell, which had the highest Jsc value.
Increased light absorptance with etching time was consistent with the increase in Jsc values; however, the improvement in Jsc appeared to be limited to an etching time of 1 min. External quantum efficiencies (EQEs, Fig. 3d) of short-wavelengths (400−550 nm) indicated that the blue responses (high-energy photons) of the 0.5 and 1 min cells improved relative to the planar counterpart because of decreased Auger recombination as well as increased light absorptance. Without surface passivation, however, the remarkable increase in NW length (2 min etched) diminished the EQEs of high-energy photons by surface recombination. In contrast, the improvement in quantum efficiency of low-energy photons (long wavelengths) was directly proportional to the NW length, because longer NWs are more effective at trapping light.6 The measured Jsc values in Fig. 3c can also be estimated from EQE spectra by using the following equation:  where Ss is the AM 1.5G solar spectrum, Qx is the EQE, λ is the light wavelength, q is the electron charge, h is Planck's constant, and c is the speed of light. The highest Jsc value (33.65 mA cm−2) was obtained under optimized conditions (1 min etched) for carrier collections for both short and long wavelengths, despite the superior antireflectance properties of the 2 min etched cell.

Fig. 4a shows the measured and simulated IQEs for planar and selective-emitter NW solar cells. Simulated values were calculated from the optimized model using a commercially available, one-dimensional solar cell modeling program (PC1D) for IBM PC operation. Because PC1D was unable to model the NW morphology, the best fits for modeling IQE were extracted from thickness variations of degenerately p-doped (≥1019 cm−3) emitters on planar cells, which optimizes Auger recombination to match the experimental data.18 Our planar solar cell was optimized with the fitting results assuming an emitter thickness of 200 nm (Fig. 4b). Employing selective-emitter NWs improved IQE improvements (up to 1 min etching times) by decreased emitter thicknesses (decreasing Auger recombination) in comparison to the planar reference cell without NWs. Note that we optimized the emitter thicknesses in all NW samples to be thinner than the corresponding NW lengths. This clearly implies that certain portions of the NWs functioned as semiconductor (not metallic) light absorbers.
 Fig. 4  (a) IQEs of planar and selective-emitter-NW solar cells. All symbols are PC1D-calculated IQEs, which best fit the measured IQEs. The etching time (measured) was converted to the thickness of the degenerately P-doped emitter for the calculated symbols. (b) Lengths of NWs (measured, black) are compared with the emitter thicknesses (calculated, red) of panel a, extracted from the PC1D simulation. 

Fig. 5 compares the measured IQEs and current densities of conventional and selective-emitter-NW solar cells, in which the top-metal electrodes of the conventional NW solar cells directly contacted the NW tips after heavy doping of NWs. The blue response of the IQE spectra improved notably upon applying the selective-emitter NW structure, implying that Auger recombination due to degenerately doped emitters governed the IQE characteristics of high-energy photons. Severe degradation in the blue response of IQE is a typical characteristic of nanostructured solar cells with a high surface-to-volume ratio.31 In most cases, poor Jsc and conversion efficiency have been reported to stem from surface recombination due to the large surface areas of nanostructures; however, in our work, we showed a clear difference between conventional and selective-emitter NWs, and demonstrated that increased recombination was mostly due to Auger recombination associated with nanostructured emitters that were more heavily doped than planar-emitters under identical thermal doping conditions. Despite their large surface areas, the blue response of IQE for selective-emitter-NWs increased from 7.0 to 60.8% at 450 nm, and reached >90% from 580 to 840 nm by simply decreasing the phosphorus concentrations. A significant Jsc gain was also obtained by employing a selective-emitter-NW structure. We obtained a Jsc value of ∼3 mA cm−2 for the selective-emitter solar cells, which is ≥10% higher than the value obtained for a conventional NW solar cell.

The conversion efficiency increased from 8 to 12.8% along with the improved Jsc, Voc, and FF results (Table 1). In particular, FF was improved notably (68.6%) compared to conventional NW solar cells (49.4%) requiring direct Ohmic contacts using the NW tips. To extract contact resistivity (ρc), we applied the transmission line model (TLM)32 which is a classical approach for determining contact resistance (Rc). To measure the Rc of Si/Ag, several metal grids were deposited on the Si surface in various samples (ESI Fig. S3†). We can assume that the total resistance between any two metal grids is the sum of resistances of the two grid contacts (2 × Rc) and silicon. The resistances were measured by adjusting the number of pitches between two metal grids, as shown in Fig. 6. At the zero-point (the intersection with the y-axis in Fig. 6) of the grid pitches, resistance was due to the two grid contacts (2 × Rc) without the influence of the emitter, because the electric current only flowed through two contacts. In our work, the ρc (contact area × Rc) of Si/Ag in the selective-emitter NW structure was 3.03 mΩ cm2 since the measured Rc was 0.91 Ω at the 3.30 × 10−3 cm2 contact area. Owing to the formation of planar Ohmic contacts for the selective-emitter NW structure, a superior contact resistivity of 3.03 mΩ cm2 was obtained in contrast to the value (25.90 mΩ cm2) of conventional NW solar cells (Fig. 6). In practice, the FF value of selective-emitter NW solar cells was almost identical to that (69.3%) of a planar solar cell.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed highly efficient (12.8%) nanowire solar cells by employing a self-aligned selective emitter structure without costly optical patterning. Using facile one-step etching, we obtained direct contacts between top-metal electrodes and degenerately doped planar silicon, while concomitantly utilizing low-doped silicon nanowires as optical absorbers. This resulted in the improvement of all photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, and FF) in addition to a remarkable improvement (7.0 to 60.8% at 450 nm) in the blue response in the IQE. Our selective-emitter technique can be used to generate improved nanowire solar cells with superior light absorptance (improved carrier generation) as well as robust top-metal contacts (improved carrier collection).
Experimental section
We used one-step metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) to retain moderately doped NWs in the light absorption region by removing the top-ends (degenerately doped) of the original NWs. We used 525 μm thick, Czochralski-grown, 1−10 Ω cm, p-Si(100) wafers. After standard RCA (Radio Corporation of America) cleaning, an emitter layer was formed by phosphorus diffusion adopting a spin-on-dopant (SOD) method, as described elsewhere.11 Phosphorous silicate precursors (P509, Filmtronics) were spun onto a wafer, and the n++-emitter formed in a tube furnace using a mixed ambient of N2 and O2via thermal diffusion of gaseous phosphorous at 900 °C for 30 min. Phosphorus glass that remained after SOD diffusion was removed using a diluted HF solution. Al was thermally evaporated for the backside electrode. Front metal grids of Ti and Au were prepared simply using a mask evaporation technique without the need for costly lithographic patterning; Ti and Au were evaporated onto the n++-emitter layer via a shadow mask set (Fig. 1a). This patterning approach spontaneously generated metal-line patterns by metal deposition only without the assistance of optical steppers, photoresists, or plasma etchers. The patterned structure of the front metal grids consisted of busbars with a width (w) of 500 μm and eight fingers (w = 80 μm) arrayed perpendicularly to each busbar. These metal grids normally shaded ∼9.95% of the total front-surface-area in our solar cells. Anti-reflective Si NWs were prepared using MACE applied only to emitter regions exposed between the metal grids. Silver nanoparticles (NPs) were precipitated uniformly for 10 s using a galvanic displacement reaction employing an aqueous solution of HF (4.8 M) and AgNO3 (0.01 M). After cleaning, Si NWs were allowed to form at room temperature for 10−120 s using a mixed solution of HF (4.8 M) and H2O2 (0.5 M). NW diameters were 50–200 nm and the NW length was adjusted by varying the etching time. Residual Ag NPs were then removed using concentrated nitric acid (30 wt%) for 20 min, and the NWs were finally rinsed with de-ionized water. As shown in Fig. 1b, one-step MACE yielded a selective-emitter structure consisting of lightly doped NWs and Ohmic contacts, because the degenerately doped top-ends of NWs positioned in-between the metal grids were selectively removed during MACE. A sample area of 10 × 10 mm2 was used for photovoltaic measurements of Si NW solar cells.
The depth profile of phosphorus ions has been measured by using a magnetic-sector secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS, CAMECA IMS 7f) attached with a Cs ionization source. The Cs+ primary ions were accelerated to 10 keV and the secondary positive ions were extracted at 5 keV. The surface morphology of Si NW arrays was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). Optical reflection measurements were performed over wavelengths of 300–1000 nm using a UV-Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 750, Perkin Elmer) equipped with a 60 mm integrating sphere (Labsphere) to account for total light (diffuse and specular) reflected from the samples. Photovoltaic properties of Si NW solar cells were investigated using a solar simulator (Peccel technology PEC-L11) as well as a potentiostat (HS-technologies Ivium stat) under 1 sun light intensity (100 mW cm−2). A 150 W Xe arc lamp with AM 1.5G filters was used as the light source. Incident flux was measured using a calibrated power meter, and double-checked using a NREL-calibrated solar cell (PV Measurements, Inc.). IQE was measured using a Xe light source and a monochromator at wavelengths of 400–1100 nm.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic showing the key features of self-aligned selective-emitter-NW solar cells. (a) Ag NPs are deposited onto a planar solar cell by a galvanic displacement process. A SIMS depth profile of phosphorous overlaps with p–n junctions. (b) MACE results in the formation of moderately doped Si NWs in the light absorbing area while leaving metal electrodes on top of the degenerately doped Si NWs.	 
Si + H2O2 + 6HF → 2H2O + H2SiF6 + H2	(1)
2Ag + H2O2 + 2H+ → 2Ag+ + 2H2O	(2)
Si + 4Ag+ + 6F− → 4Ag + SiF62−	(3)

 	Fig. 2  (a) Schematic describing the reaction steps for the formation of moderately doped Si NWs. (b) Cross-sectional SEM image of Si NWs selectively etched in the light absorbing area. The solid yellow line indicates the interface between the metal layer and silicon. (c) Magnified view showing the rough and porous morphology around the NW tips. (d) Lengths of selective-emitter-NWs (LNW, dotted line) and bulk Si etching (Lbulk, solid lines) are plotted as a function of etching time, for H2O2 concentrations [H2O2] of 0. 015 (red), 0.045 (black), and 0.18 (blue) M.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 3  (a) J−V curves of selective-emitter-NW solar cells with different etching times; 0 (black), 0.5 (red), 1 (blue) and 2 (green) min. The inset shows the average reflectance (Ravg), which is spectrally weighted over the wavelengths of 400–1000 nm. (b) Reverse saturation current density (J0, black) and open-circuit voltage (Voc, red) extracted from the J−V curves plotted in panel a. (c) Jsc (blue), FF (red), and the conversion efficiency (green) of selective-emitter-NW solar cells are plotted as a function of etching time. (d) EQEs with different etching times; 0 (black), 0.5 (red), 1 (blue) and 2 (green) min.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 4  (a) IQEs of planar and selective-emitter-NW solar cells. All symbols are PC1D-calculated IQEs, which best fit the measured IQEs. The etching time (measured) was converted to the thickness of the degenerately P-doped emitter for the calculated symbols. (b) Lengths of NWs (measured, black) are compared with the emitter thicknesses (calculated, red) of panel a, extracted from the PC1D simulation.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) IQE vs. Jsc for the selective-emitter-NW (red) and conventional NW (black) solar cells. The blue area denotes the additional Jsc gained by adopting selective-emitter NWs. (b) J−V curves for planar (black), selective-emitter-NW (red), and conventional NW (blue) solar cells.	 

Planar cell	540	19.46	69.3	7.28
Conventional NW cell	531	30.73	49.4	8.05
Selective-emitter-NW cell	555	33.65	68.6	12.8

 	Fig. 6  Plot of resistances measured by varying the pitches of the grid lines; planar (black), selective-emitter-NW (red), and conventional NW (blue) solar cells.
