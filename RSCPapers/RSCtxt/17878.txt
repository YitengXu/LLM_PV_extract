By optimizing the reaction temperature of the QDs, a photo-current density of 145 μA cm−2 can be achieved due to the effective separation of the photogenerated carriers. Meanwhile, the as-prepared photoanodes exhibit excellent stability of the photoresponse for more than 4000 s of on–off switching and one-month duration. Our study provides a new strategy to construct an eco-friendly PEC system with high performance which shows potential applications for PEC-type devices.
1. Introduction
A photoelectrochemical (PEC) system, relying on the chemical reactions driven by solar energy, provides an effective approach to resolve the increasingly serious energy crisis and environmental issues.1–5 It typically consists of a photoanode and a counter electrode immersed in an electrolyte and connected with an external circuit. Under illumination, the photoactive material on the photoanode harvests the sunlight to generate electron–hole pairs, which induces the redox reactions and converts light energy into an electric signal. As the key component, the photoanode governs the overall performance of a PEC system.6–9 Due to the excellent photo-catalytic activity and PEC-stability, the transition metal oxide semiconductors such as TiO2,10,11 and ZnO12,13 have widely been used as photoanode materials. Unfortunately, the wide bandgap of these materials makes the light absorption mainly occur in the ultraviolet (UV) range, which accounts for only ∼5% of the solar spectrum. To expand the light absorption region into the visible and near infrared region, various kinds of narrow bandgap semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been designed, such as the conventional II–VI semiconductor QDs (CdS,14–16 CdSe,17,18 CdTe,19,20 Bi2S321–23 and Co3O424,25etc.) and the newly emerged perovskite materials (CsPbBr3,26 BaTiO3,27 and SrTiO3,28etc.). However, the stability of perovskite QDs is still a challenge,29,30 especially in aqueous solution in the PEC systems. Moreover, these two kinds of QDs contain toxic elements, which are not environmentally friendly and limit their applications. Therefore, it is highly necessary to explore a stable and eco-friendly narrow bandgap semiconductor material that is suitable for PEC devices.
I–III–VI2 semiconductor QDs like CuInS2,31 CuInSe2,32 AgInS2,33 and AgInSe2,34 are known as alternatives of II−VI compounds and have been identified to be very eco-friendly.35 Due to their superior optical and electrical properties, these compounds have been widely investigated and found potential applications in solar cells, photodetectors, photocatalysis, cell imaging and light-emitting diodes.35–42 In particular, AgInS2 QDs have attracted a lot of attention because of their tunable bandgap, high quantum yields and high extinction coefficients,43–46 which render them promising candidates for eco-friendly light absorbing materials of PEC photoanodes, whereas, to our best acknowledge, there are few reports about AgInS2 QDs that served as the sensitizer of the PEC photoanodes.47–49
On the other hand, the PEC performance of the photoanodes is dependent on the effective separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs under light illumination, whereas the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in excited states tend to recombine rapidly at or near the semiconductor surface, which has been considered as one of the major limitations to obstruct the photocatalytic efficiency.50 To suppress the electron–hole pair recombination, various strategies have been developed, including surface modification with noble metals,51–53 formation of heterostructures with carbonaceous materials54–56 or combining with other semiconductors with matched energy levels.57–61 Among these strategies, coupling semiconductor QDs with carbonaceous nanomaterials has been proven to be an effective way to improve the PEC performance, where the carbon-based nanostructures act as outstanding electron acceptors and highly conducting scaffolds.56 In this regard, extensive research has been devoted to engineering novel graphene-based nanocomposites employing various graphene nanostructures, such as graphene sheets,62 reduced graphene oxide,63 graphene aerogel,64 porous graphene,65,66 graphene foam,67 and honeycomb-like structured graphene.68 Despite the progress, the growth of these materials usually requires the assistance of catalysts or involves organic templates, which are almost impossible to remove afterwards without destroying the structures and also environmentally unfriendly. Graphene nanowalls (GNWs) are wall-like three-dimensional (3D) graphene networks that can be directly grown using a catalyst-free method, which avoids complex and fussy transfer processes for applications.69–71 Noticeably, GNWs possess excellent electrical conductivity, wideband absorption, high stability and a large specific surface ratio. These features make 3D GNWs an eco-friendly conductive framework to combine with semiconductor QDs to improve the their PEC performance.
Herein, we proposed an eco-friendly photoanode with improved PEC performance by embedding AgInS2 QDs into 3D GNWs. AgInS2 QDs are in situ synthesized using a facile method by heating a mixture of metal sources with sulfur sources, of which the surface defects can be controlled by adjusting the reaction temperature. GNWs are directly grown on silica substrates using a catalyst-free Radio Frequency Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (RF-PECVD) method without post-transfer. By constructing the AgInS2/GNW heterostructure, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs are effectively separated and the recombination is suppressed, improving the PEC performance of the photoanodes. Experimental results show that the AgInS2/GNW photoanodes exhibit a high photo-current density of 145 μA cm−2, and excellent stability for more than 4000 s of on–off switching and one-month duration.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Silver nitrate (AgNO3, ≥98%), oleic acid (99.0%), trioctylphosphine (TOP, 90%), technical grade 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%), indium(III) acetate (In(Ac)3, 99.99%), oleylamine (OA, 70%), 1-dodecanethiol (DDT, ≥98%), and sulfur (S, 90%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Chloroform (99.99%), toluene (99.99%) and ethanol (99.9%) were supplied by Fisher Scientific. H2 and CH4 were purchased from Chongqing Ruixin Gas Co., Ltd (Chongqing, China). Silica wafer was purchased from Suzhou crystal silicon electronic and technology Co., Ltd. All the chemicals were used as received.
2.2 Synthesis of AgInS2 QDs
AgInS2 QDs were synthesized using a hydrothermal method. Sulfur stock solution was obtained by dissolving sulfur powder (19.2 mg) in OA (0.200 mL). The stock solutions were heated to 120 °C for further use. Then In(Ac)3 (0.1 mM), Ag(NO)3 (0.1 mM), oleic acid (0.2 mM), DDT (1.2 mL), ODE (4 mL), and TOP (0.1 mL) were mixed in a three-necked flask (100 mL), which was placed in a heating jacket with a nitrogen environment and heated to 120 °C under magnetic stirring for 30 min until the solution turned clear. The sulfur stock solution was injected into the three-necked flask quickly, followed by maintaining the reaction temperature at 120 °C for 2 h and then air-cooled to room temperature. The QDs were collected by centrifugation, washed several times with absolute ethanol and air dried. The purified nanocrystals were finally dispersed in toluene for storage. The size of AgInS2 QDs was tuned by controlling the reaction temperature at 120 °C, 150 °C and 180 °C.
2.3 Preparation of AgInS2/GNW photoanodes
GNWs were directly grown on silica substrates described in our previous work.71 Briefly, a tube-style RF-PECVD system is selected to deposit GNWs onto the cleaned substrates, using a mixture gas of methane (CH4) and hydrogen (H2) with a flow ratio of 6:6, under a base pressure of 50 Pa and RF power of 250 W for 180 min, followed by rapid cooling to room temperature under H2 flow. Finally, the as-grown GNWs were immersed in QD toluene solution overnight to prepare the AgInS2/GNWs photoanodes.
2.4 Characterization
The powder samples were prepared by drying the purified product at room temperature on a glass slip for further characterization. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a D8 Advance Bruker-AXS (GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) diffractometer using the X-ray source of Cu Kα (1.5405 Å) (40 kV, 200 mA). PL spectra were recorded using a LS 55 PerkinElmer luminescence spectrometer. To measure the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples using the UV-visible-NIR spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-4100), GNWs were peeled off from the substrate and dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonicating for 720 min in an ultrasonic homogenizer at a constant temperature of 25 °C. Then the AgInS2 QD powder was dispersed in the resulting GNW solution to obtain a AgInS2 QDs/GNWs solution under the same ultrasonication conditions. A drop of the samples dispersed in toluene was deposited onto a carbon-coated copper grid and dried at room temperature for the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization, which was performed using a JEOL JEM-3010F field emission TEM operating at 200 and 300 kV. Time-resolved PL spectra were measured using a Fluorolog HORIBA JOBNYON. The morphology and microstructure of the as-grown GNWs and AgInS2/GNWs were observed via Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS) (FEI Nova 400, at 10 kV). Raman spectra were recorded via Raman spectrometry (Renishaw inVia Manual WiRE3.4) with an excitation source of a 532 nm laser.
2.5 PEC measurement set-up
The Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and PEC response measurements were performed in a standard three-electrode system using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, CHI Co., Ltd), with AgInS2/GWs as the working electrode, Pt foil as the counter electrode, and the Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was 0.5 M Na2S solution. The working electrode was illuminated from the front side by a solar-simulated light source (CHF-XM-500W) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated by an FZ-A type radiometer (Beijing Normal University Photoelectric Instrument Factory). The resultant impedance spectra were analyzed using the Zview software. All the experiments were carried out under ambient conditions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of AgInS2 QDs
We first examined the morphology of the as-synthesized AgInS2 QDs. The TEM images of the AgInS2 QDs prepared at 120 °C, 150 °C and 180 °C are shown in Fig. 1a–c, respectively. The figures show that the obtained QDs are nicely spherical in morphology and well dispersed, implying their high nanocrystalline quality. Meanwhile, it is found that the size of AgInS2 QDs can be easily tuned by controlling the reaction temperature. The average size of the QDs increases from ∼2 nm to ∼5 nm as the reaction temperature increases from 120 °C to 180 °C. This indicates that the high reaction temperature facilitates the formation and growth of AgInS2 QDs. In addition, the HRTEM images in the insets suggest that the lattice planes of the nanocrystals are all aligned along the (112) plane.
 Fig. 1  TEM images of the AgInS2 QDs prepared at 120 °C (a), 150 °C (b) and 180 °C (c), respectively. The insets show the corresponding HRTEM images. 
The crystal structures of the synthesized AgInS2 QDs were further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 2a, the XRD pattern of the synthesized AgInS2 has the crystal structure of hexagonal Wurtzite with diffraction peaks at around 27°, 45° and 54°, which are assignable to the diffraction of the (112), (204) and (312) planes, respectively. At a low reaction temperature of 120 °C, the diffraction peaks are quite broad, indicating that the obtained AgInS2 nanocrystals are small in size. As the reaction temperature increases, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks gradually reduces. The average diameters (Table S1, ESI†) of the samples calculated by Scherrer's formula from XRD patterns show good agreement with the results observed from the HRTEM images. Moreover, the intensity of the diffraction peaks increases with increasing reaction temperature, confirming the increased crystallinity and the reduced surface defects of the AgInS2 QDs.

The PL spectra and UV-Vis spectra were then used to characterize the optical behaviors of the as-prepared AgInS2 QDs. As shown in Fig. 2b, the emission wavelengths are 650 nm, 695 nm and 730 nm for the samples prepared at 120 °C, 150 °C and 180 °C, respectively, under the excitation of 365 nm UV light. The corresponding digital photo of the QDs in toluene with strong emissions can be seen in the inset. The observed red shift of the emission wavelength with increasing temperature could be attributed to the narrowing bandgap of the AgInS2 QDs induced by the size-dependent quantum effect, which can be roughly calculated from the UV-Vis spectra in Fig. 2c. The cutoff wavelengths at the absorption edge estimated from the UV-Vis spectra are 649 nm, 738 nm and 780 nm for 120 °C, 150 °C and 180 °C, respectively, corresponding to bandgaps of 1.91 eV, 1.68 eV and 1.59 eV calculated by using Eg = 1.24/λ, where λ is the cutoff wavelength (in μm). The difference between the emission wavelength and absorption cutoff wavelength can be attributed to the anti-Stokes photoluminescence of QDs. In addition, the PL spectra are quite broad with a full width at half maximum of ∼160 nm, which is mainly related to the distribution of vibrational states. Such broad spectra are favorable for the AgInS2 QDs as the sensitizers of photoelectrochemical anodes.
The PL relaxations were further measured to investigate surface defects of AgInS2 QDs and radiative lifetime of PL emission, as shown in Fig. 2d. These PL decay curves are well fitted by a biexponential equation I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1)+A2exp(−t/τ2), where A1 and A2 are the amplitude of the decay components, and τ1 and τ2 represent the fast and slow decay time. The corresponding fitting parameters given in Table 1 indicate that the PL decays of the AgInS2 QDs are temperature-dependent. When the reaction temperature is 120 °C, the fast decay component (τ1 = 42 ns) and the slow decay component (τ2 = 389 ns) make a contribution of 55.83% and 44.17% to the whole emission profile, respectively. It is believed that τ1 was attributed to the surface defects such as vacancies, while τ2 is attributed to both the donor–acceptor recombination and the conduction band to acceptor recombination.33 This indicates that a certain number of surface defects existed in AgInS2 QDs prepared at a low temperature. As the reaction temperature increases, the contribution of the fast decay component to the emission profile decreases. It means that the fast decay component is suppressed, suggesting that the surface defects are effectively reduced. Noticeably, when the reaction temperature increases to 180 °C, the contribution of the fast decay component reduces to only 29.82%. Therefore, the decay profile appears to be single-exponential with a total PL lifetime of 910 ns. The QDs with fewer surface defects would be more favorable since they are more stable in the PEC reaction.

3.2 Characterization of AgInS2/GNW composites
The morphology of the pure GNWs and AgInS2/GNWs is shown in Fig. S1, ESI† and Fig. 3a. It clearly shows that the entire surface of the silica substrate was fully covered with well-connected flower-like graphene sheets, which possesses the feature of multilayer graphene sheets, as shown in the TEM image of Fig. 3b. The vertical height of GNWs is measured to be about 2.6 μm (inset in Fig. 3a). This nano-textured 3D network structure makes the GNWs possess not only well-connected electron transport paths, but also high specific surface area, and are therefore suitable frameworks to deposit AgInS2 QDs for PEC photoanodes. As presented in the SEM and TEM images of AgInS2/GNWs as shown in Fig. 3a and c, the AgInS2 QDs are homogeneously coated on the GNWs surface and also well embedded inside the GNWs. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern given in the inset of Fig. 3c (top panel) shows the ring pattern that can be indexed to the (112), (204), (312) planes of the AgInS2 QDs. Meanwhile, the HRTEM image (bottom panel in Fig. 3c) of the AgInS2 QDs/GNWs shows the excellent binding between AgInS2 QDs and graphene sheets. The successful combination of AgInS2/GNW composites can be further confirmed by the EDS spectra of the GNWs and AgInS2 QDs/GNWs as shown in Fig. 3d. The corresponding element content is given in Table S2, ESI.† In addition, the elemental mapping of C, Ag, In, and S elements in the inset of Fig. 3d manifests that these elements are uniformly distributed on GNWs.

The insets show the elemental mapping of C, Ag, In, and S. (e) XRD and (f) Raman spectra of 3D GNWs and AgInS2/GNW nanocomposites. The temperature of AgInS2 QDs used for the measurement here is 180 °C. 
The XRD and UV-Vis spectra of the AgInS2/GNW composite also confirms the successful combination of AgInS2 QDs and GNWs. As shown in Fig. 3e, the XRD patterns of GNWs have a single sharp peak at 26°, which corresponds to the (002) diffraction peak of graphite. When GNWs were deposited with AgInS2 QDs, the broad diffraction peaks of AgInS2/GNWs indicate that the pattern completely possesses the feature of the composite material. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S2, ESI,† the pure GNW can absorb a wide range of visible light due to its wideband absorption. After combining with AgInS2 QDs, the absorption spectrum exhibits the absorption property of AgInS2 QDs but with a higher absorption, indicating their successful combination.
The Raman spectrum is used to characterize the nature of GNWs, as shown in Fig. 3f. Three distinct peaks can be observed at approximately 1350 cm−1 (D-band), 1580 cm−1 (G-band), and 2690 cm−1 (2D-band).70 The intensity ratio of the 2D-band and the G-band (I2D/IG < 1) indicates that the 3D GNW network contains few-layered graphene. The Raman spectrum of the AgInS2 QDs/GNWs exhibits an obvious variation in the background peak, caused by the deposition of QDs. The high D-bands reveal a lot of defects and edges which originated from rapid nucleation and growth of GNWs, which is coincident with the observed SEM images.
3.3 PEC performance of AgInS2/GNW photoanodes
The PEC performance of the as-prepared AgInS2/GNWs photoanodes was monitored using a standard three-electrode electrochemical system, with the AgInS2/GNWs as the working electrode, Pt foil as the counter electrode, and the Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, respectively. Fig. 4a presents the CV curves of GNWs at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 within a potential range of −1.5 to 1.5 V under light illumination. Two prominent redox peaks can be observed. The left peak is associated with the reduction reaction at the Pt counter electrode and the right peak originates from the oxidation reaction that takes place at the AgInS2/GNWs photoanode. It can be seen that both redox peaks shift to a lower potential with increased reaction temperature of QDs from 120 °C to 180 °C, resulting in the decrease of the peak-to-peak separation. According to the basic principle of CV measurement, the peak-to-peak separation and the peak current are two important parameters to evaluate the catalytic activity of the electrode. A smaller peak-to-peak separation and a larger peak current indicate higher catalytic performance.72 The above results suggest that the AgInS2/GNW photoanode possesses excellent catalytic activity, which can be attributed to the excellent electronic conductivity of GNWs that make the charge diffusion process easier from the AgInS2/GNWs photoanode to the Pt counter electrode.

(b) Photocurrent steady state responses of AgInS2/GNW photoanodes under varying bias potential. (c) PL spectra. (d) Transient photo-current responses of AgInS2/GNW electrodes at varying reaction temperature. Transient photo-current responses of GNW electrodes (black line) are also provided for comparison. (e) Plots of ln D for AgInS2/GNW photoanodes at an applied bias voltage of 0.5 V. (f) The Nyquist plots of the AgInS2/GNW photoanodes at varying reaction temperature. 
The PEC performance of the AgInS2/GNW photoanodes was then investigated through a transient photo-current response test upon periodic on–off cycles of visible light illumination. The photo-current density of the AgInS2/GNW photoanodes with varying bias potential during on–off cycles with an interval of 40 s is shown in Fig. 4b. The reaction temperature of the AgInS2 QDs is 120 °C. It can be seen that the background currents of the electrodes are almost zero in the dark. Upon irradiation, the photocurrent is generated instantly, where a spike can be observed because of the rapid photoresponse of AgInS2 QDs upon the light excitation and then quickly returns to the steady state. When the light is switched off again, the photocurrent decays to the initial values. The rise-time and decay-time are calculated to be 0.23 s and 0.41 s, respectively. Such a repeatable and fast photo-current response suggests the excellent PEC performance of the AgInS2/GNWs photoanode. This could be readily understood by the observed quenching of fluorescence in the AgInS2/GNW nanocomposites. As compared in Fig. 4c, the photoluminescence of the AgInS2/GNW nanocomposites (blue lines) is much weaker compared to pure AgInS2 QDs (black lines), which could be ascribed to the fast transfer of photo-generated electrons between AgInS2 QDs and the GNWs. In addition, the photo-current density increases from 30 μA cm−2 to 105 μA cm−2 as the bias potential increases from 0.1 V to 0.5 V, which can be attributed to the fact that the application of positive potentials can enhance the PEC performance. The applied bias potential across the photoanode would construct a potential gradient within GNWs and AgInS2 QDs, which promotes the separation of photo-generated holes and electrons.73 This result suggests that optimization of PEC performance can be rationally modulated by adjusting the applied bias potential in our device.
It is found that the PEC performance of the AgInS2/GNW photoanodes can be further improved by optimizing the reaction temperature of AgInS2 QDs. Fig. 4d shows the photo-current density of the AgInS2/GNW photoanodes with varying reaction temperature of AgInS2 QDs under 0.5 V applied bias potential. The photo-current density of the GNW photoanode (green lines) is also provided for comparison. Clearly, all the transient photocurrents exhibit good switching behavior and the photocurrents of the AgInS2/GNW photoanodes are at least 4 times larger than that of the pure GNW electrode (25 μA cm−2). This can be explained as the AgInS2 QDs is mainly responsible for the generation of charges, while the GNWs contribute to the rapid transport of photo-generated charges to avoid the electron–hole recombination which improves the photocurrents of the AgInS2/GNW photoanodes. In particular, the photocurrent density of the AgInS2/GNW photoanodes increases from 100 μA cm−2 to 145 μA cm−2 as the reaction temperature of AgInS2 QDs increases from 120 °C to 180 °C. Such improved photocurrent density with increasing reaction temperature can be attributed to the reduced trap states in the surface defects of AgInS2 QDs. According to the previous reports, the presence of trap states would limit the PEC performance by facilitating the recombination of electron–hole pairs.74,75 As shown in Fig. 2a and d, increasing the reaction temperature can effectively suppress the surface defects during the synthesis of AgInS2 QDs. Therefore, the carrier recombination rate can be effectively reduced which further leads to better photocharge separation and transfer when sensitized with GNWs due to their large surface area and high electron mobility, resulting in the improved photocurrent density.
The transient photocurrent decay that occurs immediately upon illumination is further investigated to gain a qualitative understanding of the charge recombination behavior of the AgInS2/GNW photoanodes. Under illumination, the sudden photo-induced separation of electron–hole pairs results in a relatively sharp photocurrent spike (I(in) as shown in Fig. 4d). The spike then decays and reaches a steady-state current (I(st)) once the charge generation and recombination rates reach equilibrium. A lower recombination rate should give rise to a longer transient decay time τ, which can be calculated using a chronoamperometry plot as follows,76,77 (1) (2)where I(t) is the photocurrent at time t, and transient decay time τ is defined at the time when In(D) = −1. The logarithmic plots of photocurrent transient decay D of AgInS2/GNW photoanodes with varying reaction temperature under a bias voltage of 0.5 V are shown in Fig. 4e. Transient decay time τ of the photoanodes is evaluated to be 3.2 s, 6.8 s and 10.6 s for a reaction temperature of 120 °C, 150 °C and 180 °C, respectively. The result signifies the better photo charge separation and transfer for the QDs with increased reaction temperature, which is consistent with the above results.
The improvement in charge transferring capability of the AgInS2/GNW photoanodes is further supported by Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) results. EIS Nyquist plots of the prepared photoanodes with varying reaction temperature are illustrated in Fig. 4f. These EIS Nyquist plots are fitted by using an equivalent circuit model (inset) with Z-view software, which contains the solution resistance (Rs), the electron-transfer resistance (Ret), the double layer capacitance (Cdl), and the Warburg impedance (Zw). The corresponding fitted data are summarized in Table 2. It can be observed from Fig. 4(f) that the impedance spectrum consists of a semicircle diameter at higher frequencies and a linear portion at low frequencies. According to previous studies, the semicircle diameter equals the electron-transfer resistance Ret, which is associated with the charge-transfer process at the photoelectrode surface.78 The smaller the diameter, the better the charge conveying capability of the electrode is.79 Obviously, the impedance spectra of the AgInS2/GNW photoanodes exhibit a smaller radius of a typical semicircle in comparison to the GNW electrode. In addition, the semicircle diameter exhibits a decreasing tendency with Ret decreasing from 336.3 Ω to 190.1 Ω as the reaction temperature of QDs increases from 120 °C to 180 °C, reflecting the accelerated electron transfer between the AgInS2/GNW photoanodes and the Pt counter electrode. This process promotes the efficient separation and transfer of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs, which is facilitated for the photo-response of the electrodes.

It has been further found that the surface trap states of the QDs also influence the stability of the photoanodes. Here, both cycle stability and time stability measurements have been carried out to evaluate the durability of the AgInS2/GNW photoanode. As shown in Fig. 5a, the photo-current response behavior of the AgInS2/GNW photoanodes is still observable even after 4000 s of on–off switching, suggesting a relative high stability of the photoanodes. Meanwhile, the AgInS2/GNW photoanode with 180 °C reaction temperature exhibits better stability than that with 120 °C and 150 °C. For the photoanode with a 180 °C reaction temperature, the photocurrent density depicts a slight decay to 94% of its initial value after 50 cycles. While for the photoanodes with reaction temperatures of 120 °C and 150 °C, the photocurrent density degrades to 64% and 79% of their initial values, respectively. The reduced photocurrent over time can be attributed to the trap states in surface defects which induces the accumulation of the photo-generated holes under long-term operation in aqueous solution, which results in the photo-corrosion of the QDs.80 In order to evaluate the time stability of the as-prepared AgInS2/GNW photoanodes, additional long-time photocurrent response measurements are carried out as further evidence. The photocurrent densities of photoanodes after being stored for one day, one week, and one month are given in Fig. 5b. Obviously, the photoanode with a 180 °C reaction temperature shows the best long-term stability with photocurrent density retaining 80% of the primary stage after one month. In contrast, the photocurrent density severely drops to 58% and 32% for the photoanodes with reaction temperatures of 120 °C and 150 °C. Such steadily decreased stability of the photoanodes can be attributed to the presence of trap states in surface defects which facilitates the recombination of electron–hole pairs and results in the photo-corrosion of the QDs. Despite this, a quite clear on–off switching behavior can still be observed for all the cases, implying the good long-term stability of the AgInS2/GNW photoanodes under ambient conditions.

Based on the above discussion, a probable photo-catalytic mechanism for the AgInS2/GNW photoanode has been proposed as presented in Fig. 6. It is apparent that the interconnected framework of GNWs provides an excellent architectural arrangement for facilitating charge carrier transport. Sudden irradiation of the visible light leads to rapid initial generation of electron–hole pairs, where the electrons (e−) are excited from the valence band (VB) of the AgInS2 QD to its conduction band (CB), leaving holes (h+) in the VB. Due to the higher conductive band of AgInS2 (∼3.2 eV)81 than the work function of GNWs (−4.5 eV),67 the GNWs act as an excellent electron acceptor and it is beneficial for electrons to transport quickly from the conductive band of AgInS2 to GNWs. This process efficiently hinders the recombination rate of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, resulting in a significantly improved lifetime of the photogenerated carriers. The migration of the photo-generated electrons to the Pt electrode for the reduction reaction leads to a great photocurrent excitement at the early stage of the illumination. Then the photocurrent decreases over time due to the charge recombination as the holes diffuse towards the surface to combine with their redox partners. Once the rates of photo-charge generation and recombination reach an equilibrium, the photocurrent levels off at a steady state current. For the AgInS2 QDs with lower reaction temperature, many surface defects exist at the QDs’ surface, which results in the recombination of the electron–hole pairs and degradation of the photocurrent response.74 Meanwhile, under long-term operation in aqueous solution, the accumulation of holes at QDs’ surface leads to the mismatch of the rate of injection of holes into the electrolyte and the transfer rate of electrons into GNWs, resulting in the anodic photo-corrosion reactions of the QDs. Therefore, the photoanode exhibits attenuated amplitude of the photo-current density and worse stability for the QDs with lower reaction temperature.

4. Conclusions
In summary, an eco-friendly photoanode with enhanced PEC performance was prepared by combining AgInS2 QDs with GNWs. The AgInS2 nanocrystals with tunable PL emissions were synthesized and controlled by the reaction temperature and then embedded into GNWs directly grown on silica by a catalyst-free direct growth. The prepared AgInS2/GNW photoanode exhibits a clear light on and off PEC response with comparable short rise-time (0.23 s) and decay-time (0.41 s), which is attributed to the interconnected 3D network of GNWs that provides an immediate pathway for charge transport from AgInS2 to GNWs. By increasing the reaction temperature of the QDs, the surface defects of QDs can be effectively suppressed, which results in the increase of photocurrent density from 100 μA cm−2 to 145 μA cm−2 as the reaction temperature increases from 120 °C to 180 °C. Moreover, the photoanodes with AgInS2 QDs synthesized at higher reaction temperature provide a better photoresponse stability due to the reduced surface defects of QDs that can effectively suppress the photo-corrosion under long-term operation in aqueous solution. This work provides an insight into the construction of eco-friendly photoanodes for PEC applications with high performance.
