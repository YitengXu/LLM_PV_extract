    , Accepted 27th January 2016First published on 28th January 2016AbstractTransition-metal-oxide semiconductors are promising photoanodes for solar water splitting due to their excellent chemical stability and appropriate bandgaps. However, in absorbers such as BiVO4, TiO2, α-Fe2O3, and WO3, charge carriers localize as small polarons or become trapped, leading to low minority carrier mobilities. This limits the minority carrier collection efficiency in the quasi-neutral region of the light absorber, and lowers the overall photoactivity. In this work, we demonstrate that modestly elevating the temperature activates minority carrier hopping in monoclinic BiVO4, significantly enhancing the saturation photocurrent without a substantial anodic shift of the onset potential, and is an attractive alternative to employing complex passivation layers and nanostructured templates towards achieving the theoretical photocurrent density. Specifically, using a Mo:BiVO4/SnO2/Si tandem photoanode/photovoltaic, increasing the absolute temperature by 11% from 10 to 42 °C elevates the saturation photocurrent from 1.8 to 4.0 mA cm−2. This strong temperature enhancement, 3.8% K−1, is 5 times greater than that in α-Fe2O3. Concurrently, the onset potential shifts slightly from 0.02 V to 0.08 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (or equivalently, from −1.22 V to −1.13 V versus the equilibrium potential of oxygen evolution). Our observation contrasts with the prevailing understanding that the energy conversion efficiency generally decreases with temperature as a result of reduced photovoltage. Thermally-activating minority carrier transport represents a general pathway towards enhancing the photoactivity of light absorbers where hopping conduction limits the minority carrier collection in the quasi-neutral region.

Broader context
Photoelectrochemical water splitting is an attractive strategy for storing intermittent solar energy in the form of chemical bonds. Transition-metal oxides, in particular, are stable photoanodes for solar water oxidation. However, one of the main challenges is their extremely low minority carrier mobilities, resulting from charge carrier localization. This critically limits the practical sunlight-to-fuel conversion efficiency. To date, the predominant route to address the low carrier mobility has been nanostructuring, which lowers the required migration length for the photoexcited carriers, though at the expense of increasing the surface recombination rate. Strategies to directly mitigate the low minority carrier mobility remain elusive. In this work, we demonstrate that thermal activation is a viable route towards improving the minority carrier mobility and enhancing the photoactivity of light absorbers limited by hopping conduction in the quasi-neutral region. This unexpected observation of strong thermal enhancement of the photocurrent contrasts with the prevailing understanding in photoelectrochemistry and photovoltaic cells that the energy conversion efficiency generally decreases with temperature as a result of reduced photovoltage.

Introduction
Converting solar energy into chemical fuels using photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells is a promising route to mitigate the intermittency of sunlight.1,2 While semiconducting transition-metal (TM) oxides such as BiVO4, TiO2, α-Fe2O3, and WO3 have been investigated extensively as stable photoanodes for solar water splitting, achieving a large photocurrent with a sufficiently cathodic onset potential remains challenging.3,4 One limiting material property of many TM oxides is low electrical mobility, typically <1 cm2 V−1 s−1.5–7 These oxides conduct through localized electrons/holes that result from trapping and/or from the greater localization of d orbitals relative to s and p orbitals, which comprise the bands of high-mobility semiconductors such as Si and GaAs.7 Generally, the high doping level required to attain sufficient majority carrier conductivity in these hopping-type oxides greatly reduces the thickness of the space-charge region to a few nanometers.8 As a result, a significant portion of light is absorbed in the quasi-neutral region of the absorber, where the minority carrier diffusion length (LD) determines the photocurrent yield. To date, nanostructuring has been the predominant route employed to improve the minority carrier collection by shortening the required diffusion length.9–12 While this approach has generated appreciable performance enhancements in low-mobility oxides,13,14 it does not address the fundamental issue of slow minority carrier transport, and rather adversely increases the surface recombination rate.3
In many electrochemical devices such as fuel cells,15 electrolyzers,16 and molten metal batteries,17 thermal energy is employed to enhance hopping-type conduction as well as the rate of catalytic reactions. However, in PEC and photovoltaic cells, it has been observed that thermal energy generally lowers the energy conversion efficiency.18,19 Device-level simulations of PEC cells based solely on Si-like light absorbers confirm that the decrease in the photovoltage with temperature outweighs the increase in the exchange current density of the electrocatalysts.20 However, this commonly held view was developed for band conductors with delocalized charge carriers (e.g., Si), where the electron mobility decreases slightly with temperature.8 In light absorbers such as TM oxides exhibiting hopping conduction, on the other hand, the minority carrier mobility is expected to increase with temperature exponentially in an Arrhenius manner,6,21 and could give rise to a substantially improved minority carrier collection efficiency in the quasi-neutral region.
This effect was recently investigated by the present authors in α-Fe2O3. The saturation photocurrent for water oxidation was essentially independent of temperature. On the other hand, some thermal enhancement, 0.8% K−1, was observed for sulfite oxidation.22 This enhancement was rather small considering the activation energy of the minority carrier mobility, from which we estimate a temperature coefficient on the order of 2% K−1 (assuming a 0.2 eV activation energy). We propose that the lack of photocurrent enhancement for water oxidation in hematite is due to fast interfacial recombination, and attribute the weak temperature dependence for sulfite oxidation to the small minority carrier diffusion length LD (2–4 nm)23 compared to the width of space-charge region (∼10 nm) (see ESI† for photocurrent simulation).24 To fully realize thermal activation of photocurrent, we hypothesize that the light absorber should have a LD that is considerably larger than the depletion layer thickness, such that the minority carrier mobility determines the photocurrent yield.
Monoclinic BiVO4 is a promising photoanode material for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) with a moderate carrier lifetime and a large minority carrier diffusion length.25–31 However, like many other oxides, BiVO4 exhibits slow charge carrier transport, with a majority carrier mobility of 0.05–0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature (RT)6,32 and a hopping activation energy of ∼0.3 eV.6,21 Though the minority carrier mobility has not been measured directly, the estimation from the diffusion length (LD ∼70 nm, which depends on the particle size, crystallinity and doping level)32,33 and the carrier lifetime (in the range of 10 ns to 10 μs)31,32 gives a mobility in the range of 10−1 to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, consistent with a hopping conduction mechanism, either due to strong electron-lattice coupling (forming small polarons) or to electron-defect coupling (forming trapped carriers).
In this work, we demonstrate that combining a Schottky photovoltaic layer (to increase the photovoltage) and thermal activation (to increase the saturation current) is a viable route towards improving the performance of oxide photoanodes for OER, and is an attractive alternative to established nanostructuring pathways for enhancing the photoactivity. A monolithic tandem photoanode/photovoltaic consisting of Mo-doped monoclinic BiVO4 (Mo:BiVO4) was fabricated directly atop a planar SnO2/n-Si junction (Fig. 1a). At RT, the photoanode exhibits a photocurrent onset potential of 0.03 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a neutral electrolyte. By elevating the temperature from 10 to 42 °C, the saturation photocurrent density at 1.0 V vs. RHE increased by a factor of 2.2, from 1.8 to 4.0 mA cm−2, while the onset potential shifted slightly anodic from 0.02 to 0.08 V vs. RHE (or equivalently, from −1.22 to −1.13 V vs. OER equilibrium potential). The thermal enhancement for the photocurrent, 3.8% K−1, is 5 times greater than that of hematite. This photoactivity was obtained alongside good stability for over 30 h, with a temperature-independent Faradaic efficiency of ∼90%. We attribute the photocurrent enhancement with temperature to the activation of minority carrier hopping in the quasi-neutral region of BiVO4 without significantly decreasing the carrier lifetime. This represents a general strategy to enhance the PEC performance of hopping-type semiconductors where the photocurrent is generated mainly in the quasi-neutral region.

Results and discussion
Monolithic CoPi/Mo:BiVO4/SnO2/Si
A single-crystalline n-Si wafer coated with ∼110 nm of Sb-doped SnO2 by pulsed-laser deposition (Sb:SnO2/Si) served as a photovoltaic junction substrate.34,35 Monoclinic BiVO4 was fabricated on this substrate via electro-deposition of BiOI and thermal decomposition of VO(acac)2 and MoO2(acac)2, as inspired by the recent report by Kim & Choi et al.26 (see ESI† for X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra). The morphology of the as-grown Mo:BiVO4 film consists of a three-dimensional nanoporous network with an average primary particle size of ∼110 nm (inset of Fig. 1b and Fig. S2, ESI†). To eliminate the overpotential due to the ohmic loss from the majority carrier transport, the Mo doping level (nominal 1.0 mol% Mo) and the film thickness (∼630 nm) were optimized by comparing the saturation photocurrent under front and back illumination for Mo:BiVO4 grown on F-doped SnO2 (FTO) (Fig. S4–S6, ESI†). When the transport of majority carriers is limiting, back illumination gives a higher photocurrent since there is a shorter distance for the majority carriers to transport through the film. Indeed, for films with thicknesses greater than 800 nm, back illumination gives a higher photocurrent than front illumination, indicating a majority carrier transport limitation (Fig. S6, ESI†). For the film thickness selected in our work (∼630 nm), majority carrier transport is not limiting. Since this film thickness is greater than the optical penetration depth for BiVO4, light absorption does not limit the photocurrent (see the UV-vis spectrum in Fig. S7, ESI†). Finally, to improve the rate of electrocatalysis, a thin layer of the cobalt phosphate (CoPi) catalyst was photo-electrodeposited onto the surface of Mo:BiVO4.

Fig. 1c compares the photocurrent of Mo:BiVO4 on FTO and on Sb:SnO2/Si at RT in a 0.5 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) under AM 1.5G illumination. The photocurrent at 1.0 V vs. RHE (2.8 mA cm−2) is essentially identical, and is moreover representative of typical nanostructured BiVO4. Adding the Schottky photovoltaic junction shifts the photocurrent cathodically, giving an onset potential (defined as the potential at the current density of 0.10 mA cm−2) of 0.03 V vs. RHE for water oxidation. This is ∼400 mV more cathodic than the photoelectrode without Sb:SnO2/Si, and is the lowest turn-on voltage for a monolithic BiVO4-based photoanode reported. The photoactivity in a sulfate electrolyte (pH 7) was also examined, which is slightly lower than that in a phosphate buffer solution due to the inability of CoPi to self-regenerate (Fig. S9, ESI†).36
In order to confirm the role of Sb:SnO2/Si junction in the monolithic tandem photoanode, we measured the photocurrent while controlling the wavelength of the incident light. As shown in Fig. 1d, illuminating the tandem electrode with 650 to 1100 nm light gives no appreciable photocurrent until an anodic bias greater than 1.5 V vs. RHE was applied. A similar increase in photocurrent was observed at the same potential under broadband illumination. This photocurrent reflects the single-photon absorption in Si because the long-wavelength photons cannot excite BiVO4. On the other hand, illuminating the electrode with 360 to 550 nm light gives a small, saturated photocurrent at potentials greater than 0.30 V vs. RHE. Here, the photocurrent in the Sb:SnO2/Si Schottky photovoltaic junction is limiting, because most of the photons are absorbed by BiVO4 rather than penetrating through to Si. Only when the broadband solar spectrum is used to excite both Si and BiVO4via a two-photon process does the monolithic tandem photoanode show a cathodically-shifted onset potential while sustaining a high saturation photocurrent. A similar methodology was employed in hematite/Si to improve the onset potential.37,38
Thermally-enhanced photocurrent
Having confirmed the excellent OER onset potential of CoPi/Mo:BiVO4 in tandem with a SnO2/Si Schottky photovoltaic junction at RT, we explored the possibility of thermally activating minority carrier hopping in BiVO4. A small thermocouple was mounted directly on the back of the monolithic photoelectrode, as well as placed in the electrolyte a few mm away from the sample. After illumination for more than 10 h, the electrode and electrolyte temperatures differ by no more than ±1 °C under all temperatures examined (Fig. S8, ESI†). Upon increasing the temperature from 10 to 42 °C (283 to 315 K, an 11% increase), the photoactivity of the monolithic tandem photoanode improves significantly, with the saturation photocurrent at 1.0 V vs. RHE increasing by a factor of 2.2, from 1.8 to 4.0 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. 2a). Lowering the temperature back to 10 °C gives 1.7 mA cm−2, indicative of the reversibility. The thermal enhancement observed here, 3.8% K−1, is 5 times larger than that observed in hematite (see Fig. S18 for comparison, ESI†).22 According to the Arrhenius plot, the activation energy of the saturation photocurrent is 0.18 ± 0.01 eV (inset of Fig. 2a). Beyond increasing the magnitude of the photocurrent, thermal energy also gives rise to a considerably sharper photocurrent transition from the reaction-limited regime to the saturated regime at higher temperatures. Specifically, the instantaneous Tafel slope at 0.20 V vs. RHE decreased substantially from 488 mV dec−1 at 10 °C to 156 mV dec−1 at 42 °C, leading to an improved fill factor. The onset potential of the tandem photoanode shifted slightly from 0.02 V (10 °C) to 0.08 V (42 °C) vs. RHE, with a temperature coefficient of approximately 1.9 mV K−1. Even without quantitative analysis, it is clear that the improvement in the saturation photocurrent and fill factor significantly outweighs the slight anodic shift of the onset potential. Our combination of a Schottky photovoltaic layer and thermal activation gives a low onset potential with a high photocurrent, without employing complex passivation layers or nanostructured templates.
We also investigated the temperature dependence of the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of Mo:BiVO4 on FTO. The IPCE was measured by varying the wavelength of a small-magnitude monochromatic light superimposed on a 1 sun solar spectrum (Fig. 2b, see Fig. S16 for other background light intensities, ESI†). The IPCE is enhanced significantly throughout the investigated wavelength range when the temperature is increased from 8 to 48 °C. At 0.60 V vs. RHE, for instance, the IPCE at 410 nm increases from 23% at 8 °C to 61% at 48 °C, by a factor of 2.7. Integrating the IPCE curves over all wavelengths gives values that agree with the photocurrent under broadband illumination, providing further evidence for the significant thermal enhancement of photocurrent (Fig. S16, ESI†).

(c) Stability of a CoPi/Mo:BiVO4/SnO2/Si photoanode under different temperatures and after re-depositing the CoPi catalyst.

Inset, the photocurrent measured in the current–voltage curves under the same temperature at 0.50 V vs. RHE.

The measurement was carried out at 0.50 V vs. RHE under 1 sun illumination in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution (pH 7). 
At first, one is tempted to attribute the increase of the saturation photocurrent to the thermally-enhanced electrocatalysis rates, as is typically assumed in device models.20 However, we observed that the saturation photocurrent for water oxidation is comparable to that for sulfite oxidation at RT, and moreover at a lower temperature of 10 °C as well (Fig. 1c and Fig. S14, ESI†). This observation indicates that in the saturation regime, all holes that reach the surface of the CoPi-coated Mo:BiVO4 participate in the OER. In other words, the CoPi catalyst is already sufficiently active in the saturation regime, such that additional improvements in the electrocatalysis due to thermal energy would only decrease the onset potential, not increase the saturation photocurrent. We observed a similar temperature dependence of the saturation photocurrent for both water and sulfite oxidation (Fig. S15, ESI†), providing additional confirmation that the significant increase in the photocurrent with temperature cannot simply be attributed to the thermally-enhanced electrocatalysis.
Beyond the thermally-enhanced PEC activity, we also evaluated the stability of the monolithic tandem photoanode as a function of temperature in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 neutral electrolyte (in which SnO2/Si photovoltaic junction exhibits higher stability, though at a small expense of the photocurrent as already mentioned). The photocurrent was measured at 0.50 V vs. RHE under 1 sun illumination for a total of 30 h while sequentially dwelling for 10 h at each of the following temperatures: 10, 25 and 42 °C (Fig. 2c). The photocurrent increased monotonically with temperature, quantitatively consistent with the current–voltage measurements (inset of Fig. 2c). The photoactivity degraded slightly at 42 °C (approximately 1.1% per hour). Re-depositing the CoPi catalyst restored the photocurrent, confirming that the slight loss in the photocurrent is due to the degradation of electrocatalysts rather than of BiVO4. To confirm the sunlight-to-fuel conversion, the evolved gaseous products were quantified by gas chromatography. The H2:O2 ratio was 2.0 ± 0.1, and the Faradaic efficiency was ∼90%, both of which are independent of temperature (Fig. 2d, Fig. S17 and Table S1, ESI†). The slight deviation of the Faradic efficiency from unity is likely due to the crossover of H2 and O2.39
To demonstrate that the thermal activation is a generalizable strategy for improving PEC water oxidation, we carried out an additional study on rutile TiO2. Like BiVO4, TiO2 is a polaronic semiconductor with a LD of ∼20 nm.6,40 Increasing the temperature from 10 to 85 °C doubles the saturation photocurrent density from 0.7 to 1.4 mA cm−2 (corresponding to 1.3% K−1), which is moreover stable over 24 h (Fig. S20, ESI†). The onset potential shifted slightly from 0.23 to 0.28 V vs. RHE. The smaller enhancement than that of BiVO4 is probably due to the shorter LD.
Mechanisms underlying the temperature-dependent photocurrent
The energetic barrier for minority carrier hopping gives rise to an Arrhenius-type mobility, which increases quasi-exponentially with temperature.6,21 As we show next, the increased saturation photocurrent with temperature is consistent with the thermally-activated hole mobility in the quasi-neutral region of Mo:BiVO4. Since both the optical penetration depth and the minority carrier diffusion length are much greater than the depletion layer thickness in BiVO4, and without absorption, electrocatalysis, or majority carrier transport limiting the photocurrent, the collection of minority carriers from the quasi-neutral region determines the saturation photocurrent. A strong dependence of the photocurrent on temperature with a thermal activation energy of 0.18 ± 0.01 eV (Fig. 2a) suggests that the increase in LD is due to thermal activation of the hole mobility and, moreover, implies that the carrier lifetime only depends weakly on the temperature. Indeed, investigation of the carrier lifetime in α-Fe2O3, another well-studied small-polaron semiconductor, suggests the temperature dependence is very weak.41
To further confirm the thermally-enhanced LD, we compared the photocurrent of Mo:BiVO4 on FTO with two different particle sizes, without the convolution of the buried photovoltaic junction. In addition to the nanoporous structure with particle sizes between ∼80 and 160 nm (with an average size of ∼110 nm, comparable to 2LD at RT,32,33Fig. 3a), we also fabricated a macroporous Mo:BiVO4 electrode with particle sizes between ∼180 and 400 nm (with an average size of ∼275 nm, which is nearly 4 times larger than LD at RT) (Fig. 3b and Fig. S2, ESI†). In the case of the nanoporous BiVO4, the saturation photocurrent evolution with temperature is nearly identical to that with the buried photovoltaic junction (Fig. S11, ESI†), confirming that the junction has no direct impact on the thermal enhancement. The photocurrent of the macroporous photoelectrode is lower than that of the nanoporous anode at RT, consistent with the carrier collection from a smaller volume fraction of the material. The saturation photocurrent increases monotonically with temperature in both structures (Fig. 3c and Fig. S12, ESI†). For the macroporous photoanode, the saturation photocurrent density (at 1.0 V vs. RHE) increases quasi-linearly with temperature for all conditions examined, with an average temperature coefficient of 1.2% K−1. On the other hand, for the nanoporous photoanode, the temperature dependence (2.5% K−1) is much stronger than that of the macroporous electrode, and the photocurrent plateaus above 35 °C.

(c) Comparison of the saturation photocurrent (at 1.0 V vs. RHE) as a function of temperature for both nanoporous and macroporous electrodes under 1 sun illumination in a 0.5 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) with 0.1 M Na2SO3. A photocurrent plateau was observed in the nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 for temperatures above 35 °C. (d) A schematic illustration of the relationship between minority carrier diffusion length (LD) and particle size (LP) as a function of temperature. In the nanoporous electrode with smaller particles (left column), LD at elevated temperatures is large enough compared to LP/2, leading to the plateau of the photocurrent with temperature. In the macroporous electrode with larger particles (right column), LP/2 is larger than LD for all the temperatures examined, leading to an increase of the photocurrent at all temperatures. We assume that the carrier lifetime is weakly dependent on the temperature, as discussed in the text. (e) Comparison of the onset potential, defined at 0.1 mA cm−2, as a function of temperature for both nanoporous and macroporous electrodes under 1 sun illumination in a 0.5 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) with 0.1 M Na2SO3. 
We rationalize the different temperature dependences of the saturation photocurrents in macroporous and nanoporous photoanodes by comparing the different transport lengths for minority carriers. At a critical temperature, the thermally-enhanced LD is large enough compared to the particle size that the minority carrier transport no longer limits the photocurrent. In the nanoporous electrode, this gives rise to a photocurrent plateau with temperature. In the macroporous electrode, on the other hand, the particle size is sufficiently large compared to LD at all temperatures examined such that the plateau is never reached. Our interpretation is summarized schematically in Fig. 3d. The stronger temperature dependence of the saturation photocurrent for the nanoporous electrodes below 35 °C, as compared to that for the macroporous electrodes, is due to their larger aspect ratio, enabling the collection of minority carriers from a greater volume fraction of the material for the same increase in temperature.
The observation of the photocurrent plateau above 35 °C in nanoporous electrodes is again inconsistent with photocurrent enhancement by thermally-activated electrocatalysis, as is typically assumed in device models. As already discussed, the saturation currents for water and sulfite oxidation are nearly equal. This suggests that the CoPi catalyst is already sufficiently active in the saturation regime, such that additional improvements in the electrocatalysis due to thermal energy do not increase the saturation photocurrent. The plateau of the photocurrent provides additional confirmation that the significant increase in the photocurrent with temperature is due to the improvement of minority carrier collection rather than to the thermal enhancement of the electrocatalysis.
It is notable that thermal energy is an effective route for activating BiVO4 lacking nanostructuring. As can be seen in Fig. 3c, by increasing the temperature from RT to 47 °C, the saturation photocurrent of the macroporous electrode approaches that of the nanoporous electrode at RT, despite the former having a ∼3× smaller surface-area-to-volume ratio. The onset potentials of the photoelectrodes are nearly identical at RT, but the macroporous photoelectrode exhibits a noticeably lower onset potential at higher temperatures (Fig. 3e). The dependences of onset potential on temperature at different currents were also compared, showing the same trend (Fig. S13, ESI†). We speculate that the macroporous electrode exhibits a smaller shift in onset potential because of its smaller overall surface area and correspondingly lower interfacial recombination rate.
Finally, we rationalize why the temperature dependence of the photocurrent is much greater in BiVO4 (3.8% K−1) than in α-Fe2O3 (0.8% K−1). Due to the high doping level in both materials, the space-charge layer widths are small, on the order of 10 nm. However, in BiVO4, LD is much larger than in α-Fe2O3. Since the minority carrier mobility mainly determines the photocurrent yield in the quasi-neutral region rather than in the space-charge region, temperature has a significantly greater effect on light absorbers with large LD, such as BiVO4. Indeed, our numerical simulation confirms the intuition that when LD is much smaller than the space-charge region width (as in the case of α-Fe2O3), the photocurrent becomes insensitive to LD (Fig. S18, ESI†). Additionally, the larger surface area of BiVO4 examined here may also contribute to the high temperature coefficient, due to the collection of minority carriers from a greater volume fraction.
Temperature-dependent photovoltage
In addition to improving minority carrier collection in BiVO4, thermal energy also lowers the thermodynamic potential of the OER and improves the rate of electrocatalysis at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. Both of these, along with the photovoltage, contribute to the observed anodic temperature dependence of the photoelectrode onset potential (1.9 mV K−1). We measured a well-defined open-circuit potential (OCP) in a phosphate buffer solution using an [IrCl6]2−/[IrCl6]3− reversible redox couple. At a concentration ratio of 1:10, the redox couple exhibits an equilibrium potential of 1.22 V vs. RHE in a pH 7 electrolyte,42 which is very close to the equilibrium potential of OER. Thus, the built-in voltage at the Mo:BiVO4/electrolyte interface in the presence of the [IrCl6]2−/[IrCl6]3− is expected to be similar to that without the redox couple. Fig. 4a shows the OCP for Mo:BiVO4/SnO2/Si. The potential of the Pt counter electrode (CE) is stable during the measurement and was recorded as the reversible redox potential. In the dark, the photoanode gave the same potential as the CE, confirming that the Fermi level is well aligned to the solution redox potential. Under 1 sun illumination, the OCP of the working electrode exhibited a repeatable value of 0.14 V vs. RHE, while the OCP of the Pt CE remains unchanged. The photovoltage of Mo:BiVO4/SnO2/Si, 1050 mV at RT, was calculated as the difference between the OCP in the dark and light conditions, which is 350 mV higher than that of Mo:BiVO4 on FTO (Fig. 4b), consistent with the cathodic shift of turn-on voltage (∼400 mV) of the monolithic electrode. The photovoltage decreased with temperature at 5.3 mV K−1 (Fig. 4c), resulting from the smaller quasi-Fermi-level splitting due to the increasing intrinsic carrier concentration. This photovoltage-temperature coefficient is ∼2 times larger than that observed in Mo:BiVO4 (Fig. 4c), α-Fe2O3,22 Schottky-barrier silicon solar cells19 and Ga1−xAlxAs-GaAs p–p–n heterojunction solar cells,43 which can be attributed to a decrease of the photovoltage in both Mo:BiVO4 and Si at a rate of 2–3 mV K−1 each.

Importantly, the temperature dependence of the onset potential (1.9 mV K−1) for OER is substantially smaller than the decrease of the photovoltage with temperature. This is because the thermodynamics and kinetics of OER, in addition to the photovoltage, also contribute to the temperature dependence of the onset potential. In particular, the equilibrium potential of OER decreases from 1.24 V vs. RHE at 9 °C to 1.21 V vs. RHE at 42 °C.44,45 Kinetically, the activity of the CoPi electrocatalyst also increases with temperature. For CoPi on FTO, the overpotential required to achieve a current density of 0.10 mA cm−2 (at which the onset potential is defined) decreases from 0.26 V to 0.18 V when the temperature is increased from 9 to 42 °C. A slightly larger overpotential with a similar temperature coefficient was also observed for CoPi on Mo:BiVO4/FTO (Fig. S19, ESI†). The temperature-dependent recombination rate at the light absorber/catalyst/electrolyte interface could also contribute to the relatively small shift of the onset potential.
Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated a monolithic CoPi/Mo:BiVO4/SnO2/Si tandem photoanode for solar water splitting, which exhibits a turn-on potential of 0.03 V vs. RHE at RT. The saturation photocurrent is limited by minority carrier hopping in the quasi-neutral region of BiVO4, which was activated by increasing the temperature without significantly lowering the minority carrier lifetime. Additionally, faster electrocatalysis with temperature along with a lower equilibrium potential mitigates the decreasing photovoltage with temperature. The significantly enhanced saturation photocurrent and fill factor, and the relatively weak temperature dependence of the onset potential, confirm that thermal activation is a promising route to increase PEC efficiency in hopping-type light absorbers. Such a moderate temperature increase could be easily attained with on-cell optical concentration46–48 and/or absorption of the infrared light. This work demonstrates an alternative strategy to improve PEC activity without changing the feature size and surface area of light absorbers.
Experimental methods
Synthesis
A detailed description of the methods is available in the ESI.† Briefly, an n-type Si wafer (1–5 Ω cm) was coated with ∼110 nm of Sb:SnO2 by pulsed-laser deposition (PLD/MBE-2300, PVD Products). To prepare the ablation target, SnO2 powder was mixed with Sb2O3 powder (6 wt%), pressed uniaxially at 140 MPa and sintered in 21% O2 balanced with Ar at 1300 °C for 10 h. The Si wafer was first annealed at 600 °C in 230 mTorr O2 for 10 min in order to form a thin oxide passivation layer, and an Sb:SnO2 thin film was then deposited at 350 °C in 40 mTorr O2. A uniform, nanoporous BiVO4 film was synthesized by electro-depositing BiOI on Sb:SnO2/Si and thermally decomposing VO(acac)2 and MoO2(acac)2 at 450 °C in air. For comparison, nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 film was directly synthesized on FTO using the same method. The macroporous Mo:BiVO4 film was prepared by a metal–organic decomposition approach.49 To improve the rate of electrocatalysis, a CoPi catalyst layer was photo-electrodeposited onto the Mo:BiVO4/SnO2/Si electrode, as inspired by the previously reported protocols.28,50
Photoelectrochemical characterization
The PEC characterization was carried out in a homemade temperature-controlled cell (Fig. S8, ESI†), which was immersed in a water bath connected to a thermostatic circulator. The cell temperature was measured via a Teflon-coated thermocouple located adjacent to the electrode and the typical variation for a given temperature set point was ±0.5 °C. A Pt wire (Sigma Aldrich) and a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE, eDAQ Inc.) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Photocurrent measurements were carried out using a solar simulator (350–1100 nm, HAL-320, Asahi Spectra Inc.), the spectrum of which was verified by a UV-vis spectrometer (USB 2000+, Ocean Optics). The illumination intensity was calibrated to achieve a 1 sun condition (79 mW cm−2) in the wavelength range of 350–1100 nm. For the IPCE measurement, the solar simulator was coupled with a monochromator (CMS-100, Asahi Spectra Inc.) to sweep the wavelength of the incident light. In order to reveal the accurate IPCE under 1 sun condition, a second solar-simulated light was coupled into the monochromatic light as a white light bias via a 50:50 beam splitter. Product gas was quantified by on-line gas chromatography (Trace GC Ultra, Thermo Scientific).
Physical characterization
The morphology of Mo:BiVO4 was examined by SEM (FEI-XL 30 Sirion). To assess the phase purity and crystallinity, X-ray diffraction was carried out using a PAN analytical X'Pert PRO X-ray diffraction system (Cu Kα radiation). Raman spectroscopy was carried out using a Horiba HR800 system with a laser excitation energy of 532 nm. To avoid sample heating, a laser spot diameter of ∼1 μm and a laser power of ∼5 mW were used. The UV-vis absorption was measured using an Agilent Cary 6000i UV/Vis/NIR spectrometer.

Broader context
Photoelectrochemical water splitting is an attractive strategy for storing intermittent solar energy in the form of chemical bonds. Transition-metal oxides, in particular, are stable photoanodes for solar water oxidation. However, one of the main challenges is their extremely low minority carrier mobilities, resulting from charge carrier localization. This critically limits the practical sunlight-to-fuel conversion efficiency. To date, the predominant route to address the low carrier mobility has been nanostructuring, which lowers the required migration length for the photoexcited carriers, though at the expense of increasing the surface recombination rate. Strategies to directly mitigate the low minority carrier mobility remain elusive. In this work, we demonstrate that thermal activation is a viable route towards improving the minority carrier mobility and enhancing the photoactivity of light absorbers limited by hopping conduction in the quasi-neutral region. This unexpected observation of strong thermal enhancement of the photocurrent contrasts with the prevailing understanding in photoelectrochemistry and photovoltaic cells that the energy conversion efficiency generally decreases with temperature as a result of reduced photovoltage.
