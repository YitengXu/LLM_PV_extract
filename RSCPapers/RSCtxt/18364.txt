    , Accepted 3rd April 2017First published on 3rd April 2017AbstractThree planar nonfullerene acceptors (FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8) comprising a central fluorenedicyclopentathiophene (FT) core and two 2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone) terminal groups are designed and synthesized. The coplanarity of the molecular backbone can be maintained through a locked conformation via intramolecular noncovalent interactions. The solubility of these nonfullerene acceptors is very good because the FT core can bear enough flexible aliphatic side-chain substitutions. Thus, the dilemma of the planarity–solubility tradeoff can be minimized. Through changing the length of the six flexible aliphatic side chains at the central FT core, we can easily adjust the π–π interactions of nonfullerene acceptors and optimize the nanoscale morphology of the photoactive layers. Among these three small molecular acceptors, FTIC-C6C8 based active layers show the best morphology together with the highest electron and hole mobility. These inherent advantages of FTIC-C6C8 guarantee it a high power conversion efficiency of 11.12% when used in non-fullerene polymer solar cells with a wide-bandgap polymer donor PBDB-T. Our results provide an appropriate molecular design strategy for building high-performance nonfullerene acceptors and show that optimizing alkyl-side chains is a very effective way to further improve the photovoltaic performance of devices.
Introduction
Non-fullerene organic solar cells (NF-OSCs), in which a fused-ring based n-type organic compound instead of a fullerene derivative is utilized as the electron-acceptor material, have recently emerged as a hot topic in the field of organic photovoltaics.1–19 Replacement of the traditional fullerene acceptor in the photoactive layer of organic solar cells (OSCs) with a non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) can overcome the limitations of fullerene derivatives such as high-cost synthesis and purification, narrow and weak absorption in the visible to near infra-red (NIR) spectral region, limited energy level variability, and air instability.20–24 In NFA molecules, a central core composed of fused aromatic rings is an essential building block, in which the planarization forced by covalently fastening adjacent aromatic units can elongate the effective conjugation length, facilitate the π-electron delocalization, reduce the energy band gap, and extend the light absorption.25–31 In addition, coplanar geometries and rigid structures are beneficial to lowering the reorganization energy and facilitating the π–π stacking of acceptor molecules, which will enhance the intrinsic charge mobility and give ordered microphase domains.32–35 However, too strong π–π interactions due to the high degree of coplanarity tend to make the materials insoluble and unprocessable. So there is a planarity–solubility (or aggregation) tradeoff when designing the molecular structures of NFAs. That is, the requirement of molecular planarity for a NFA to enhance carrier transport usually conflicts with increasing the solubility of the NFA to suppress its large aggregation in the donor:acceptor bulk heterojunction film. Therefore, an appropriate molecular design strategy is highly desired.
To this end, here we provide a strategy to afford NFAs with both a planar molecular geometry and a good solubility. In such molecules, a core group which can bear as many as possible side-chain substitutions is utilized to construct the planar backbone. In addition, flexible aliphatic groups with different lengths are employed as the side chains to guarantee the solubility which also can fine-tune the π–π stacking distance among neighboring molecules. As a result, a photoactive layer with a good nanoscale morphology and a device with a high performance can be expected. Currently, several types of NFAs with different central cores including indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IT), perylene diimide, fluorene, naphthalene diimide and bipyridine have been developed.2,23,36–38 Among them, the IT-cored compound, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (ITIC), shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) that challenges fullerenes when used in OSCs.2 Thereafter, ITIC and its derivatives have been employed as effective NFAs in OSCs to achieve PCE higher than 10%.9,14–16,39 However, the central core, IT, only bears four side chains to adjust the π–π stacking interactions. Consequently, to obtain an appropriate solubility in common organic solvents, ITIC employs bulky and rigid alkylphenyl groups as side chains which stick out of the coplanar backbone of IT to tune the intermolecular interaction. Very recently, a NFA based on a new ladder-type backbone, fluorenedicyclopentathiophene (FT), has been reported.40 The FT core bears six side chains which is more than IT-cored compounds, so an improved solubility can be expected. It has been reported that flexible aliphatic groups could tailor the intermolecular interaction to optimize bulk properties such as absorption intensity, optical bandgap, and charge mobility in p-type polymers.39–42 As a result, herein, we utilize a FT-cored backbone and aliphatic side chains in molecular design to overcome the dilemma of the planarity–solubility (or aggregation) tradeoff and endow the donor:acceptor heterojunction film with a good morphology. We designed and synthesized three NFAs with a planar FT backbone comprising six alkyl-side chains as the core unit and 2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone) as the two end groups, named FTIC. The effect of aliphatic side chains on the nanoscale morphology of the active layer and thus the performance of NF-OSCs was investigated. The six flexible alkyl chains can be changed in length and size to tune the solubility and π–π stacking interactions of NFAs. As a result, a good molecular planarity together with a good solubility for NFAs can be simultaneously achieved.
We facilely synthesized three FTIC based NFAs in high yields from commercially available starting materials. As shown in Scheme 1, these FTIC based NFAs, namely FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8, possess six alkyl-side chains with various lengths. The backbone of the central FT core of these NFAs is highly planar, which is different from the twisted backbone of other fluorene-based acceptors.20,43 Meanwhile, the six alkyl-side chains can ensure the demanded solubility for solution-processing and appropriate aggregation when blending with a conjugated polymer donor. More importantly, the length and size of the six flexible alkyl-side chains can be easily changed to finely adjust the π–π interactions, optimize the morphology of NFAs in the photoactive layer, and adapt them to different donor polymers without causing too much steric hindrance for intermolecular packing. By optimizing the alkyl-side chain length, a high PCE of 11.12% was achieved in NF-OSCs using poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T): FTIC-C6C8 as the active layer.

Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and characterization
The syntheses of FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8 are shown in Scheme 1. Compound 1 was synthesized according to the literature procedure.44 Compound FTIC-C8C6 was synthesized as a dark blue solid in a yield of 78% by simple one-step Knoevenagel condensation of 2 and 3. Similarly, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8 were synthesized as red-black solids in yields of 83% and 87%, respectively. FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8 were fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR (shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI†) and elemental analysis. FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8 are readily soluble in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CF), and acetone. It is worth noting that FTIC-C8C6 and FTIC-C6C8 are even soluble in methanol at room temperature but FTIC-C6C6 is not. The thermal properties of these compounds were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the data are shown in Table 1 and in Fig. S2.† They all show good thermal stability with the decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) over 330 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) test was performed from 100 to 350 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. No obvious glass transition can be observed in the DSC traces as shown in Fig. S3.† The molecular stacking of PBDB-T, FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6, FTIC-C6C8 and their blend films was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. S4†). There are obvious diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns of FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8 neat films, suggesting their ordered aggregation. The diffraction peaks located at the small angles of 2θ = 25.61° for FTIC-C8C6, 2θ = 25.82° for FTIC-C6C6, and 2θ = 25.61° for FTIC-C6C8 correspond to a π–π stacking distance of 3.48 Å, 3.45 Å, and 3.48 Å, respectively. The blend films showed two perceptible peaks at 2θ of 4.25° and 24.37° for PBDB-T:FTIC-C8C6 and at 4.21° and 24.36° for PBDB-T:FTIC-C6C8, which are coincident with those of the neat PBDB-T film and the diffraction peaks of NFAs are hardly detectable, indicating that the ordered aggregation of polymer chains can be preserved and good dispersion of NFAs in the polymer matrix is achieved. This is highly desired for improving the device performance.2 In contrast, for the PBDB-T: FTIC-C6C6 blend film, besides the two peaks of the donor polymer (around 4.2° and 24.4°) there are also several clear peaks arising from FTIC-C6C6, which indicates that FTIC-C6C6 has a large aggregation in the blend film. This result is in line with the morphology investigation of the blend films (vide infra).

Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8 as films were investigated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and the spectra are shown in Fig. 1. These three small molecules exhibit broad and strong absorptions in the 400–800 nm region with a full width of 116 nm at half maximum, which is complementary to that of PBDB-T in the long-wavelength region. As films, FTIC-C8C6 and FTIC-C6C8 exhibit the same absorption peak at 687 nm but FTIC-C6C6 shows a slight red-shift of 7 nm, implying more close π–π stacking in the FTIC-C6C6 film. The absorption coefficients of FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8 in films are determined to be 2.12 × 105, 1.99 × 105 and 2.38 × 105 cm−1, respectively. The absorption peaks of the three NFAs in solution are all located at 666 nm (Fig. S5†) and the maximum molar extinction coefficients of FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8 in chloroform solutions (1.00 × 10−5 M, 1.08 × 10−5 M and 1.08 × 10−5 M, respectively) are determined to be 1.92 × 105, 1.90 × 105 and 2.01 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively, which are higher than that of ITIC (1.3 × 105 M−1 cm−1).2
 Fig. 1  UV-visible absorption spectra of FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6, FTIC-C6C8 and PDBT-T as films. 
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pure donor, the pure acceptor, and the blend films were measured and the results are shown in Fig. S6.† The PBDB-T:FTIC-C6C8 blend film shows almost 100% fluorescence quenching compared with the pure films, whereas the other two blend films still show some fluorescence. This indicates that more effective photo-induced charge transfer occurred between PDBD-T and FTIC-C6C8 in the blended film and almost all excitons dissociated.
The electrochemical properties of FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with their ultrathin films on a glassy carbon working electrode. From the CV curves (Fig. S7†), the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8 can be estimated which are listed in Table 1 and Fig. 2a. The relatively high-lying LUMO energy levels of FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8 compared to those of a typical electron acceptor material indicate that an increased Voc can be expected by using them as electron acceptors in organic solar cells. The optical data, energy levels and band gaps of the polymer donor (PBDB-T) are also summarized in Table 1.

Energy levels
To get further insight into the molecular properties of these NFAs, quantum chemistry calculations were performed. For simplicity, methyl substituents were used for the calculation instead of hexyl and octyl chains, and the simplified molecule is called FTIC. The optimized geometries of model compounds under the ground state were calculated from density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level using the Gaussian 09 package (ESI†). The relaxed potential energy scans (PES) were performed for the model molecule to evaluate the conformational preference of the indanone and the thiophene segments as shown in Fig. 3a. The results indicated that the preferential configurations are the structures with dihedral angles of 0° and/or 180° and there is an energy gap of about 5.0 kJ mol−1 between them. In the case of 0° or 180° dihedral angle, intramolecular interactions of H⋯O or S⋯O (see the inset of Fig. 3a) are responsible for maintaining the planar conformation of FTIC.45–47 According to the calculated results, FTIC could be locked in an energy preferred planar conformation through the S⋯O interaction (see Fig. 3b), since it has a lower total energy compared with that maintained through the H⋯O interaction. Such a result is in accord with our recent findings that noncovalent interactions play an important role in locking the conformation of small molecular acceptors.48

In a further step, the electronic structure and excited-state calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 suite by the TD-DFT/PCM approach at the 6-31G (d, p) level. The HOMO and LUMO distributions and the calculated frontier orbital energies of the FTIC model molecule are shown in Fig. 3b. It is clear that the electronic wave-functions of the HOMO were distributed almost entirely over the electron-rich cores; whereas, the electron density of the LUMO flowed from the central core to the terminal indanone acceptor units. Their calculated HOMO (−5.56 eV) and LUMO (−3.31 eV) energy levels were fairly close to the experimental data measured by the CV method. In addition, the predicted absorption maximum in the UV-vis spectra by B3LYP (Fig. S8†) is quite consistent with the experimental ones, which indicates that the main absorption band at long wavelengths of FTIC is associated with the HOMO → LUMO transition (see Table S1 in the ESI†).
Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the three new non-fullerene acceptors, inverted organic solar cells based on PBDB-T:NFA as the photoactive layer were fabricated with a device configuration of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer/MoO3 (8.5 nm)/Ag (100 nm). Dichlorobenzene (DCB) was used as the processing solvent and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive for depositing the active layer. The optimization process of the D:A ratio can be found in Tables S2–S4.† For FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8, the optimized D:A ratio is 1:1 (w/w) and the content of additive is 0.5 wt%, 0.3% and 0.5% DIO, respectively. The optimized thickness of FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8 based active layers is about 105, 112 and 108 nm, respectively. The corresponding photovoltaic performances are listed in Table 2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best devices based on PBDB-T and the three NFAs under the illumination of AM 1.5G are provided in Fig. S9.† Photovoltaic devices based on the three NFAs demonstrate almost the same Voc value. But the Jsc of FTIC-C6C8 (17.44 mA cm−2) is higher than that of FTIC-C8C6 (16.10 mA cm−2) and FTIC-C6C6 (16.03 mA cm−2). As a result, FTIC-C6C8 exhibits the highest PCE (10.26%) among the three NFAs. To further boost the device efficiency, we used an alcohol-soluble conjugated polymer poly[(9,9-bis{3′-[N,N-dimethyl]-N-ethylammonium]propyl}-2,7-fluorene)-alt-1,4-phenylene]dibromide (PFN-Br) as an interfacial layer and fabricated devices with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/PFN-Br (5 nm)/active layer/MoO3/Ag.49,50 As shown in Fig. 2b and Table 2, after introduction of the PFN-Br interfacial layer, although Voc values are not changed and FF values are only slightly improved, Jsc values are all obviously enhanced. Devices based on FTIC-C6C8 still show a much higher Jsc value (18.55 mA cm−2) than those of the other two NFAs (16.69 mA cm−2 for FTIC-C8C6 and 16.84 mA cm−2 for FTIC-C6C6). The corresponding PCEs for FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6, and FTIC-C6C8 based devices were obtained to be 10.45%, 9.75% and 11.12%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4a. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out to examine the response of devices to monochromatic light, as shown in Fig. 4b. The Jsc derived from integrating the product of the EQE data and the AM 1.5G solar spectrum matches well with that obtained from J–V curves (within 4% error). These devices show strong photo-responses from 300 to 800 nm. The maximum EQE value of PBDB-T:FTIC-C6C8 based devices reached 80%, indicating an efficient photoelectron conversion process. The increased EQE of the PBDB-T:FTIC-C6C8 based device in the short wavelength region can be attributed to the small molecule acceptor making the polymer more “fiber” like (vide infra).51,52 In addition, its EQE curve in the low-energy region shows a slight blue shift compared to the other two molecules. One possible reason for this phenomenon is that FTIC-C6C8 molecules are more well-dispersed (less aggregated) in the active layer than the other two NFAs. This can be inferred from the UV-vis spectra of the polymer:NFA blend films where the PBDB-T:FTIC-C6C8 film shows a slight blue shift in comparison with the other two blend films in the low-energy region (Fig. S10†). We noted that the FTIC-C8C6 based device shows an obvious EQE response at 750 nm; however, the corresponding PBDB-T:FTIC-C8C6 blend film only has a weak absorption after 750 nm. Two possible reasons may be responsible for this. One is the blend film for device fabrication is thicker than that for UV absorption measurements; another one is that FTIC-C8C6 shows a more severe aggregation than FTIC-C6C8 (as can be inferred from the surface roughness in AFM images). The formation of aggregation for FTIC-C8C6 can broaden the absorption range to a slightly longer wavelength.

In order to make a comparison with other state-of-the-art non-fullerene acceptors, we tested the optimal photovoltaic performance of the PBDB-T:ITIC based devices in our laboratory, which show a maximum PCE value of 10.04% and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S5 (ESI†). Another non-fullerene acceptor FDICTF, which has the same backbone but different alkyl side chains compared with our FTICs, demonstrates a maximum PCE of 10.06%.40 So our FTICs have a superior performance over ITIC and FDICTF. Recently, IT-M, which is a derivative of ITIC with methyl-modification, has achieved the top PCE value of 12.05%.15 But its average PCE is 11.48% and our FTIC-C6C8 based devices show an average PCE value (11.04%) very close to that one.
Charge transport and morphology
The charge carrier mobilities of active layers were estimated using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method with the device structure of FTO/active layer/Al (for the electron-only device) and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au (for the hole-only device). The results are shown in Fig. S10.† For the PBDB-T:FTIC-C8C6, PBDB-T:FTIC-C6C6 and PBDB-T:FTIC-C6C8 photoactive layers, their hole (μh)/electron (μe) mobilities were calculated to be 2.91 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1/1.94 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with μh/μe of 1.50, 2.78 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1/1.39 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with μh/μe of 2.00, and 4.60 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1/3.81 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with μh/μe of 1.21, respectively. The relatively high and balanced electron and hole mobilities of PBDB-T:FTIC-C6C8 blend films make a have contribution to the observed higher values of Jsc and PCE for devices.
The morphology of blend films fabricated under optimized conditions was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping-mode and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The AFM and TEM images are shown in Fig. 5. The three blend films exhibit significant differences. The PBDB-T:FTIC-C6C8 blend film shows well-developed fibrous features, which are considered to arise from the aggregation of PBDB-T (vide supra), and FTIC-C6C8 molecules are well dispersed around the polymer fibrils. This can also be validated from the XRD patterns (Fig. S4†), where the diffraction peaks of the polymer remain but those of FTIC-C6C8 disappear in the blend film. To further verify that the fibrous features belong to PBDB-T, we removed FTIC-C6C8 from the PBDB-T:FTIC-C6C8 blend film by washing with acetone, and then the film morphology was also detected by TEM (shown in Fig. 5g). It is clear to see that similar fibrous features are retained, so we can confirm that the nanofibrils are formed by PBDB-T. Compared with the pristine polymer film (Fig. 5h), the PBDB-T:FTIC-C6C8 blend film shows a more obvious and well dispersed fibrous structure, suggesting that the small molecule acceptor could induce polymers to form a good fibrous structure. Such a fibrous feature is highly desired for forming bi-continuous percolation networks and is beneficial for charge carrier generation and transportation.53–55 The corresponding surface root-mean-square roughness (Rq) value was 2.45 nm. Because of such good morphology for the blend film, FTIC-C6C8 based devices demonstrate the best photovoltaic performance among the three NFAs. In the case of FTIC-C8C6, the fibrous features of polymer donors are weakened though the dispersion of FTIC-C8C6 molecules in the blend film is still good and their aggregation is not severe. The surface of this blend film shows a higher Rq value (3.43 nm) than that of the FTIC-C6C8 based blend film. As for the PBDB-T:FTIC-C6C6 blend film, although the fibrous feature of the polymer donor remains good, FTIC-C6C6 molecules exhibit obvious aggregation, leading to a large surface roughness (Rq = 7.40 nm) and strong diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of its blend film (Fig. S4†). This is due to the solubility of FTIC-C6C6 being the lowest among these three acceptors under the same conditions. The large aggregates existing in the PBDB-T:FTIC-C6C6 film have a detrimental effect on the charge separation and transport, so FTIC-C6C6 based devices show the worst photovoltaic performance among the three NFAs. As a result, the marked morphology difference of the active layer shows a significant influence on the performance of photovoltaic devices and can well explain Jsc and PCEs of these three NFA based devices.

Conclusions
In conclusion, three FT based NFAs, FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6 and FTIC-C6C8, were rationally designed by fine-tuning the out-of-plane alkyl side chain length and facilely synthesized in high yields. The backbone of such NFAs is planar and bears six flexible alkyl side chains, which guarantees the simultaneous enhancement of the π–π interaction (for better charge transport) and the solubility (for better microphase separation) of these compounds compared with other reported NFAs. As a result, the dilemma of the planarity–solubility tradeoff commonly occurring in other NFA materials can be overcome. Tuning the alkyl side-chain length in such NFAs can influence the π–π stacking distance, solubility, and nanoscale film morphology in the donor:acceptor blend. Organic solar cells using the acceptor with two n-hexyl and four n-octyl side chains (FTIC-C6C8) demonstrate a higher device performance than those using the other two NFAs which bear shorter side chains (FTIC-C6C6 with six n-hexyl groups) and less long side chains (FTIC-C8C6 with four n-hexyl and two n-octyl groups). By using PBDB-T as the polymer donor, the optimized PBDB-T:FTIC-C6C8 blend film shows the best well-developed fibrous features and highly ordered packings of PBDB-T polymer chains, and thus a high PCE of 11.12% was obtained with a large Voc of 0.93 V, a high Jsc of 18.55 mA cm−2 and a good FF of 0.65. Our results thus provide an effective way to control the molecular planarity, the solubility and fine-tuning of the nanoscale film morphology to boost the performance of non-fullerene organic solar cells.
