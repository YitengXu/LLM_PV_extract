    , Accepted 9th October 2013First published on 11th November 2013AbstractThe piezoelectric potential screening by large excess electrons in nominally undoped ZnO has limited the energy conversion efficiency of the ZnO nanogenerators (NGs). In this study, we report a simple and effective approach to enhance the piezoelectric output performance of the ZnO NGs by forming a CuO–ZnO heterostructure. By depositing a ZnO thin film on the pre-deposited CuO thin film, which forms a p–n junction, excess electrons in ZnO can be effectively reduced. Thus, the piezoelectric potential generated in ZnO by an applied force can be less affected. Using this approach, we obtained an output voltage up to ∼7.5 V and a maximum current of 4.5 μA cm−2 measured under the forward connection, which is a 7-fold higher output voltage and an approximately one order of magnitude higher current density by comparison to the ZnO NGs without a CuO layer. Our results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of a CuO–ZnO heterostructure for realizing high performance flexible energy harvesting devices.
Introduction
With the extensive use of various wireless sensors and personal electronic devices, harvesting electricity from various renewable and sustainable sources of energy has gained great interest as independent power sources for such devices. For instance, energy harvesting from thermal,1,2 solar,3,4 and mechanical energy5–7 has been intensely explored to date and even widely demonstrated for practical applications. In this aspect, piezoelectric materials have also been extensively investigated to realize energy harvesting devices.8–12 Among several piezoelectric materials, ZnO, a metal oxide semiconductor with a wurtzite crystal structure, has been considered as one of the most promising candidates due to its non-toxicity and cost effectiveness, by comparison to other piezoelectric materials.13,14 However, the performance of a piezoelectric nanogenerator (NG) based on ZnO has been limited largely due to excess electrons in the ZnO layer, which screen the piezoelectric potential generated by mechanical deformation of the crystal structure along the c-axis. Nominally undoped intrinsic ZnO exhibits an n-type behavior, due to defect levels induced by interstitials, oxygen vacancies, or hydrogen, leading to a Fermi level located 50 meV below the conduction band edge.15 Thus, large excess electrons can be easily found, even at room temperature. Several attempts have been previously made to address this problem by spin-coating a p-type polymer to form a p–n junction.16–18 This greatly improved the output performance of the NG by reducing the electron screening effects. However, practical uses of such an approach can be limited by the expensive cost of p-type polymers and material degradation in an ambient condition, necessitating additional passivation process steps. As an alternative solution, we investigated CuO, a p-type metal oxide semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.35 eV, to form a metal oxide only CuO–ZnO p–n junction, where CuO naturally demonstrates p-type behavior due to cation-deficiency, acting as a hole conductor.19,20 Although CuO has been widely employed in various applications such as biosensors,21 lithium-ion batteries,22 capacitors23 and photodiodes,24 however, it has not been examined to improve the piezoelectric performance of ZnO-based NGs, to the best of our knowledge.
Here, we demonstrate a greatly enhanced piezoelectric energy conversion performance of a ZnO-based flexible piezoelectric NG, realized by forming a CuO–ZnO heterostructure, which in turn reduces the excess electrons in the ZnO. Using this approach, we have successfully fabricated and demonstrated the improved output performances of the ZnO-based NGs. In our CuO–ZnO heterostructure NG, we have observed 7-fold higher output voltages and approximately one order of magnitude higher output currents, by comparison to the devices with ZnO alone.
Experimental
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate preparation
A 220 μm-thick PET film was cleaned with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 30 s, followed by cleaning with deionized (DI) water for 30 s.
CuO thin film deposition
CuO was deposited by a RF magnetron sputter, using a high purity Cu (99.99%) sputtering target and Ar/O2 as the sputtering gases. During the deposition process, the base pressure, process pressure, RF power, and substrate temperature were maintained at 2 × 10−7 Torr, 2 × 10−3 Torr, 140 W, and room temperature, respectively, where the (Ar:O2) flow rate was fixed at (5:1.5) sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minute). We note that a CuO layer plays a key role in improving the piezoelectric output performance of ZnO-based piezoelectric NGs, where CuO is a p-type metal oxide semiconductor, forming a natural p–n junction by subsequent deposition of ZnO.
ZnO thin film deposition
A ZnO thin film was also deposited by RF magnetron sputtering, using a high purity ZnO (99.99%) target source. During the deposition process, the base pressure, process pressure, RF power, and substrate temperature were maintained at 5 × 10−7 Torr, 1 × 10−3 Torr, 140 W, and at room temperature, respectively, where the Ar flow rate was maintained at 6 sccm.
Device characterization
The output voltage and current of the piezoelectric nanogenerator were characterized using an Agilent 34401A multimeter, Stanford Research Systems SR 570 low noise current amplifier, and a Keithley 6514 programmable electrometer. The pressure applied on the NG was measured using the load cell and indicator (Bongshin, Inc.)
A schematic representation of the NG fabrication processes is described in Fig. 1(a). First, a 220 μm-thick PET film was pre-cleaned with IPA and DI water, followed by CuO deposition, using RF magnetron sputtering. Next, a ZnO thin film layer was subsequently deposited. Lastly, a 60 nm-thick Au deposition on ZnO layer by e-beam evaporator and a 60 nm-thick Cu sputtering on the bottom side of PET finalized the device fabrication process. The fabrication process employed, to realize high performance flexible piezoelectric NGs in this work, provides a few merits. Firstly, all the layers can be obtained by a physical vapor deposition process, which greatly simplifies the fabrication process by comparison to the solution-processed nanowire NG fabrication process. Secondly, the process is more suited for large-area NG production. Fig. 1(b) shows a scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the topside of the fabricated NG, in order to focus on ZnO–CuO heterostructure. Fig. 1(c) shows the flexibility of the NG. We observed that the device functions as normal, unless it is completely folded.

To confirm the material properties of the CuO and ZnO thin films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were firstly investigated (Fig. 2(a) and (b)). Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of the CuO layers deposited at different (Ar:O2) flow ratios, using 2θ values in the range 30–50°. It can be clearly observed that the two main peaks are observed at 2θ = 35.3° and 38.7°, corresponding to the CuO (002) and (111) planes, respectively, attributed to the tenorite structure of CuO. As the O2 flow rate increases from 0.5 sccm to 1.5 sccm, it can be noticed that the relative intensities of the two CuO peaks are on the rise and the widths of the peaks are getting narrow, indicating that a dense and better polycrystalline CuO is being formed. Although the dominant crystal phase of cupric oxide here is CuO, we expect that a finite Cu2O phase may also exist in the deposited film. However, both CuO and Cu2O are p-type metal oxides, which can contribute to form a p–n junction with ZnO. For the ZnO thin film, XRD diffraction peaks corresponding to the (100), (002), and (101) planes are observed, as shown in Fig. 2(b). We note that the widths of the peaks are relatively wide, since the substrate was kept at room temperature during the deposition process to develop the low temperature process, which is suited for flexible NG fabrication, and to minimize interlayer stress. By optimizing the deposition pressure25,26 or employing the substrates endurable at high temperature,27,28 the quality of the ZnO layer can be further improved. The 4-probe measured sheet resistances of the CuO and ZnO layers are ∼7 kΩ sq−1 and ∼600 kΩ sq−1, respectively, which are similar to the values reported previously.29,30 Next, the heterojunction of the two metal oxide semiconductors was investigated by fabricating a CuO–ZnO p–n junction diode. The CuO layer in this device was deposited while keeping an Ar:O2flow rate at 5.0:1.5 sccm. The p–n junction diode clearly exhibits rectifying characteristics, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The forward current of the device is 2.95 × 10−4 A under a forward bias voltage of 2 V, while the reverse current is 9.65 × 10−6 A under a revere bias voltage of −2 V. The threshold voltage of the diode was extracted to be about ∼1.9 V. The data in the forward bias region were fitted with a diode equation, I = I0[exp(qV/nkT) − 1], where I0 is the reverse bias saturation current, q is the electron charge, n is an ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. The ideality factor determined from the above equation at a moderate applied forward bias of 0.3–0.8 V is approximately 5, indicating that transport mechanisms involve defect-assisted tunnelling and carrier recombination in the space charge region via interface traps, etc.

Firstly, the output performance and schematic device structure of the NG without a CuO layer are presented in Fig. 3. When the NG is under a pressure of ∼0.6 kg cm−2, normal to the NG surface, a positive piezoelectric potential (V+) is created at the ZnO–PET interface and a negative piezoelectric potential (V−) is generated at the ZnO–Au interface, deforming the energy band diagram from the initial equilibrium condition denoted by the dashed lines (Fig. 3(c)). Thus, a positive voltage pulse appears between the two electrodes under the forward connection (Fig. 3(a)). Likewise, the dipole moment formed near the Au–ZnO interface drives the piezoelectric-induced electrons to flow through an external circuit from the Au to Cu electrode, generating a positive current pulse until the electrons accumulated near the Cu–PET interface balance the piezoelectric potential. The PET substrate here works as an insulator in addition to acting as a platform for flexible NGs, effectively preventing electron leaking. When the pressure is released, on the other hand, the created piezoelectric potential quickly disappears and the accumulated electrons flow back to the Au electrode through the external circuit, resulting in a negative current pulse. The measured maximum voltage and current density are ∼1.0 V and ∼0.5 μA cm−2, respectively. We observed similar output voltage and current levels in multiple devices. To validate that the output signals are indeed from a ZnO layer, we fabricated the device without a ZnO layer (Au/PET/Cu structure) and measured negligible output signals (Fig. S1†). In addition, the NG was measured under a reverse connection,31 demonstrating output pulses with an opposite polarity (Fig. S2†). The results indicate that the measured outputs are the true signals generated from the NG. The true signals from the ZnO NG can be estimated as ∼1.7 Vpp (peak-to-peak voltage) and ∼0.9 Ipp (peak-to-peak current), respectively.

(b) Short-circuit current density of the NG and an expanded view of the marked region (inset). (c) Schematic representations of the output power generation mechanism and an energy band diagram of a ZnO thin film NG. The excess electrons in the ZnO screen the piezoelectric potential generated, resulting in a relatively weak dipole moment, as indicated by the small energy band bending. The dashed lines indicate the energy band diagram at the initial condition. 
Next, the enhanced piezoelectric output performance of a CuO–ZnO heterostructure NG, consisting of a 60 nm-thick ZnO layer deposited on a 300 nm-thick CuO layer, is shown in Fig. 4. The thickness of the CuO layer was determined by characterizing the output performances of CuO–ZnO NGs with different CuO thicknesses. As the CuO thickness increased from 60 nm to 300 nm, the output signals were gradually increased and became saturated close to 300 nm (Fig. S3–S5†). Presumably, as the CuO thickness increases, excess electrons in the ZnO are being more consumed by recombination, resulting in an enhanced output performance. For a fair evaluation of the enhanced output performance, the sample size, applied pressure, and other experimental conditions were maintained the same as in the ZnO NG measurements. As demonstrated in Fig. 4(a) and (b), the output voltage up to ∼7.5 V and the maximum output current density of ∼4.5 μA cm−2 were observed during measurement under the forward connection, which are approximately 7-fold higher voltage and one order of magnitude higher current density by comparison to NGs without a CuO layer (Fig. 4(a) and (b)). The corresponding true signals, the averaged signal magnitudes of measurements under the forward and reverse connection, are ∼11 Vpp and ∼6.3 Ipp, respectively (Fig. S5†). We have consistently observed similar output performances in multiple devices. Fig. 4(c) shows the schematic energy band diagram of a CuO–ZnO heterostructure NG. Overall, the output power generation mechanism is the same as described in Fig. 3(c). Due to an additional CuO layer, however, a CuO–ZnO p–n junction is made, forming a depletion region near the junction boundary. Therefore, the built-in electric field near the junction boundary effectively depletes excess electrons in the ZnO layer, which in turn reduces the screening effects for the generated piezoelectric potential, leading to an enhanced piezoelectric output voltage and current.

(b) Short-circuit current density of the NG and (inset) an expanded view of the marked region. (c) Schematic representations of the output power generation mechanism and an energy band diagram of a CuO–ZnO p–n junction piezoelectric NG. The generated piezoelectric potential is enhanced by the formation of a CuO–ZnO p–n junction as indicated by the larger energy band bending compared with the ZnO NG. The dashed lines indicate the energy band structure at the initial condition. 
Lastly, the flexible CuO–ZnO heterostructure piezoelectric NG was also measured under a bending condition. The NG was slightly bent with a fingertip while one end of the device was firmly anchored on the bending stage [Fig. 5(a) (inset)]. The output voltage and current measured under the forward connection were ∼1.43 V and ∼0.92 μA, respectively. Smaller output signals, approximately half of the signals from the forward bending, were found from a downward bending (Fig. S6†). The results here demonstrate that the flexible CuO–ZnO p–n junction piezoelectric NG can even harvest energy from relatively small mechanical stresses.

Conclusions
In this report, we demonstrated a novel and simple approach to enhance the piezoelectric output power of NGs by forming a CuO–ZnO p–n junction layer. Using this approach, piezoelectric potential screening by excessive electrons was successfully suppressed, achieving a 7-fold higher output voltage and one order of magnitude higher current, compared with the ZnO piezoelectric NGs. In addition, the fabrication process introduced here is suited for realizing NGs on various flexible substrates, thanks to a low process temperature and is also suitable for fabricating large area flexible piezoelectric NGs. We expect further performance enhancement of the NGs by improving the quality of the deposited metal oxide semiconductors and optimizing the overall fabrication process.
