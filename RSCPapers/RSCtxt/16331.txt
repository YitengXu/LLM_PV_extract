    , Accepted 10th September 2019First published on 11th September 2019AbstractLow-temperature solution-processed SnO2-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved great progress recently, but they still suffer from a critical drawback due to the defects at the SnO2/perovskite interface. Herein, we report a facile acetic acid post-treatment strategy to effectively passivate the surface defects. With an optimal concentration of acetic acid, the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the planar-type triple cation PSCs is greatly increased from 18.57% to 20.33%. The champion device shows a PCE of 20.56%. In addition, the universality of this passivation strategy is double confirmed by achieving an enhanced average PCE from 19.52% to 21.64% for sequential method deposited dual cation PSCs, with a leading PCE of 21.95%. Our work demonstrates an effective passivation strategy for SnO2-based planar-type PSCs, which will benefit the development of high-efficiency PSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made tremendous strides during the last few years reaching a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2%, which is ahead of other emerging photovoltaic technologies.1 Such an astonishing development is primarily profited from their extraordinary semiconductor properties and the ease of fabrication procedure.2–4 In general, regular n–i–p type PSCs utilizing a combination of compact and mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2) as the electron transport layer (ETL) can easily deliver a PCE exceeding 20%.5–7 However, a high annealing temperature during the preparation process impedes their further application in flexible devices and large-scale manufacturing. Consequently, researchers have been developing alternatives to the TiO2 ETL, which feature low-temperature solution processing. Recently, tin oxide (SnO2) has been demonstrated to be a promising candidate for the ETL in PSCs owing to its unique optoelectronic properties, such as excellent transmittance over the visible spectrum, high conductivity and electron mobility, good stability under ultraviolet (UV) illumination, suitable energy level alignment to a large range of perovskite materials, and high compatibility with flexible devices.8–13 Benefitting from all these merits, the PCEs of SnO2-based PSCs are comparable to those of TiO2-based counterparts.
Generally, there are some unavoidable defects present in the SnO2 crystal structure due to imperfect lattice alignment over long distances, which has been considered as fatal and causes a breaking effect on its properties.14 In addition, like other metal oxide ETLs, there is a mismatch between SnO2 and perovskites. This mismatch will lead to a large number of SnO2/perovskite interface defects, which capture free charge carriers, inducing possible charge accumulation, J–V hysteresis, and poor long-term stability.15,16 Therefore, multifarious strategies are developed to eliminate these drawbacks, including the optimization of the fabrication method and the device structure, interface passivation engineering and so on. For example, the chemical bath deposition technique has been applied to fabricate high-quality SnO2 ETLs and the corresponding PSCs show excellent device performance and good long-term stability.17,18 In addition, the strategy of adapting a SnO2/TiO2 bilayer as the ETL has been demonstrated to accelerate electron extraction, which helps to improve charge transfer dynamics and increase short-circuit current density (Jsc).19,20 Recently, interface passivation engineering has gained wide attention due to its outstanding merits, such as simple process and high selectivity. A wide-range of chemicals, including fullerene derivatives, self-assembled monolayers and organic halides, have been used to modify SnO2 to passivate the surface defects and even interact with the perovskite, improving the interface characteristics.21–24
It's well known that SnO2 is sensitive to acetic acid, which has been used as the basic principle for designing gas sensors.25,26 In the present work, a facile acetic acid post-treatment procedure is introduced to modify the surface of SnO2. Through the interaction between acetic acid and SnO2, the defects at the SnO2/perovskite interface can be effectively passivated, evidenced by the space charge limited current (SCLC) model and the light intensity dependent Voc. After the modification with acetic acid, the device performance is boosted from 18.84% to 20.56% for triple cation PSCs. In addition, the universality of this passivation strategy is confirmed by achieving an enhanced average PCE from 19.52% to 21.64% for sequential method deposited dual cation PSCs. Our surface passivation strategy demonstrates characteristics of being facile and universal, and showing high repeatability, which will benefit the development of high-efficiency planar PSCs.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the acetic acid modification process, in which acetic acid of different concentrations was directly spin-coated on top of the as-prepared SnO2 film, followed by annealing at 150 °C. The SnO2 films prepared without and with the acetic acid modification process are hereafter denoted as pristine and Ac-modified SnO2 films, respectively.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram illustrating the acetic acid modification procedure. 
To investigate the interaction between acetic acid and SnO2, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out for the pristine and Ac-modified SnO2 films. The typical XPS survey is shown in Fig. 2a while the fine spectra of C 1s, Sn 3d and O 1s are exhibited in Fig. 2b–d in sequence. It can be easily seen in Fig. 2b that the binding energy (BE) of the C 1s state is located at 284.83 eV for both pristine and Ac-modified SnO2. Fig. 2c shows the spectra of Sn 3d state, which consists of two spin–orbit splitting peaks, corresponding to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2.27 Clearly, the Sn 3d peaks from Ac-modified SnO2 are shifted by ca. 0.21 eV towards the higher BE when compared to those of the pristine SnO2, indicating the presence of other negative charges surrounding the Sn atoms.28 Interestingly, when we directly added 50 μL of 5% aqueous acetic acid into 2.76 mL of SnO2 precursor solution, an obvious change in the solution's color was observed. As shown in Fig. S2a,† the SnO2 precursor solution quickly changed from colorless transparency to turbid milky white, indicating a dramatic reaction between acetic acid and SnO2. According to the classical process of acid reaction with metal oxides to produce corresponding metal salts and water, the possible chemical process is proposed, as shown in Fig. S2b.† Considering the rapidness of the whole reaction, when the acetic acid was spin-coated on top of SnO2 compact thin film, successful interaction between SnO2 and acetic acid occurred. Therefore, the additional negative charges are inferred to be provided by acetate ions, which results in the shift of Sn 3d peaks. In addition, the co-existence of the BE shift of the O 1s state further indicates the interaction between acetic acid and SnO2 (Fig. 2d).

The surface morphology of the pristine and Ac-modified SnO2 was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the data reveal that the treatment of SnO2 with acetic acid has a negligible impact on the film's surface morphology as well as the film's root-mean-square roughness. The roughness of pristine and Ac-modified SnO2 is calculated to be 2.98 nm and 3.05 nm, respectively. We also measured the optical transmission spectra of the pristine SnO2 and the Ac-modified SnO2 deposited on the ITO/glass substrates (Fig. S3†). It is found that both of them display high transmittance at the wavelength of 400 nm to 800 nm. To study the crystallinity and the preferred crystal orientations, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted, and the corresponding XRD patterns of different SnO2 films are shown in Fig. 3c. As the figure reveals, the main diffraction peaks of all samples are the same, indicating that the compact SnO2 layers obtained from the aqueous colloidal dispersion solution are a mixture of crystalline and amorphous phases,28 and the treatment of acetic acid has a negligible influence on the SnO2 structure. In addition, the high electrical conductivity of SnO2 is undoubtedly a considerable merit when serving as the ETL in PSCs. Devices with a configuration of Au/ETLs/ITO were fabricated to compare the conductivity between the pristine and the Ac-modified SnO2. Fig. 3d clearly shows that the Ac-modified SnO2 film displays higher conductivity than the pristine one. In a way, this also indicates the existence of interaction between SnO2 and acetic acid.

The triple cation perovskite films were then fabricated on top of the pristine and the Ac-modified SnO2 films and their surface morphology was investigated by SEM. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 4a. For a better comparison, the concentration of acetic acid is varied from 2.5% to 7.5%, which is diluted with de-ionized water. It is clear that all the samples possess high surface coverage without any pinholes. Fig. S4† shows the distribution diagram of the average perovskite grain size, which is significantly increased from 257 nm for the perovskite film on the pristine SnO2 to 393 nm for the one on Ac-modified SnO2. Notably, there are some white phases around the perovskite grain boundary, which are inferred to be the PbI2 residue. Excess PbI2 could passivate the trap states on the surface and the grain boundary of the perovskite film, which is beneficial to the device performance according to previous studies.29,30 To further investigate the perovskite films' bulk properties, e.g. crystallinity and light absorbance, XRD and UV-vis absorption analysis were carried out. As shown in Fig. 4b, the UV-vis absorption spectra of the corresponding perovskite films display a similar absorbance profile in the region of 500 to 800 nm. In Fig. 4c, it is also shown that, for all samples, the dominant diffraction peaks are located at 14.33°, 28.62° and 32.02°, which is consistent with the previous report of triple cation perovskite.31 The peak intensity of 5% Ac-modified SnO2-based perovskite is higher than that of the pristine perovskite, indicating better crystallinity. In addition, a small diffraction peak located at 12.88°, attributed to the PbI2 phase, is also observed in the spectra, which is in agreement with the SEM results mentioned above. These results indicate that the modification of SnO2 by acetic acid could also bring positive effects on the subsequent perovskite films, including grain size enlargement and crystallinity improvement.

The photovoltaic performances of the PSCs, utilizing the planar-type device structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Fig. S5†), based on both pristine SnO2 and Ac-modified SnO2 were investigated. The photovoltaic parameters, including Jsc, Voc, fill factor (FF) and PCE, are collected and exhibited in Fig. 5, while the average and optimum values are summarized in Table S1†. The devices based on pristine SnO2 films give an average PCE of 18.57% with Jsc = 21.83 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.137 V and FF = 0.749. After modification with 5% acetic acid, the average parameters are increased to Voc = 1.153 V, Jsc = 22.31 mA cm−2, FF = 0.791 and PCE = 20.33%. In addition, the universality of this acetic acid modification strategy was double confirmed by fabricating planar-type PSCs with different perovskite compositions, i.e., A site double cation perovskite: (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x obtained by a two-step solution-processed deposition.29 As shown in Fig. S6a and Table S2,† the device performance parameters are increased obviously after the acetic acid modification. The average PCE is improved from the initial 19.52% to 21.64% and the champion PCE reaches 21.95%, verifying the excellent effects of the acetic acid modification strategy. It is noticeable that Ac-modified PSCs feature outstanding FF values. Fig. S6b† shows the J–V curves of the triple cation PSC and the dual cation PSC with the highest FF values. For the former one, the highest FF reaches a value of 0.805, while that of the latter one reaches a value as high as 0.814, which are among the state of the art level, indicating the profound and unique effect of the acetic acid modification method.

(a)–(d) Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE distribution diagram, with box plots and the standard deviation shown alongside the data points, collected from 9 independent devices. 2.5%, 5%, and 7.5% are the concentrations of acetic acid. 
The J–V curves of the best performing triple cation PSCs based on the pristine and Ac-modified SnO2 are shown in Fig. 6a. The inset in Fig. 6a shows the photovoltaic parameters of the device. The pristine device displays an optimum PCE of 18.84% with Jsc = 22.07 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.141 V and FF = 0.748. When the Ac-modified SnO2 was applied as the ETL, the Jsc, Voc and FF are increased to 22.39 mA cm−2, 1.158 V, and 0.793, respectively, yielding a PCE as high as 20.56%. Fig. 6b shows the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the integrated current of the champion devices. An obvious enhancement of EQE in the region of 400 to 750 nm is obtained with Ac-modified SnO2, and the integrated current values of the pristine and Ac-modified devices are 20.61 mA cm−2 and 21.11 mA cm−2, respectively. We then measured the J–V curves under forward and reverse scan directions for a hysteresis test. The results are shown in Fig. S7.† The hysteresis index (HI) is calculated according to the following equation:32 HI = [JRS(0.8Voc) − JFS(0.8Voc)]/JRS(0.8Voc)(1)where JRS(0.8Voc) and JFS(0.8Voc) represent the current density in the reverse and forward scanning directions, respectively, at a bias of 0.8Voc. The HI for the pristine device is 0.073, whereas it is 0.048 for the Ac-modified device. The decrease in the HI can be ascribed to the suppression of interface charge trapping and the alleviation of the charge accumulation at the interface.33 To evaluate the operation of un-encapsulated PSCs, we measured the steady-state output of the device at the maximum power point. As shown in Fig. 6c, after illuminating for 150 s, the steady-state PCE of the pristine device is 18.19%, which is only 96% of its maximum PCE. For the Ac-modified device, the PCE stabilizes at 19.97%, and thus it retains 97% of its maximum PCE. Such a decrease in the PCE may be attributed to the existence of hysteresis in the device. In addition, long-term stability is absolutely a key merit for PSCs.34 The stability test was completed by tracking the device performance that was stored in a climate simulation box without encapsulation with a temperature and relative humidity of 25 ± 2.5 °C and 40 ± 5%, respectively. Fig. 6d shows a normalized PCE measured as a function of storage time. It is clear that 73.8% of the initial PCE is retained for the Ac-modified device after storing for 30 days. Meanwhile, the PCE of the pristine device degrades to 56.6% of the initial value under the same conditions. These results indicate a better long-term stability of the Ac-modified device, which is mainly attributed to the better quality of Ac-modified perovskite film, benefitting from higher crystallinity and fewer grain boundaries.

(c) Static PCE measured as a function of time for pristine and Ac-modified devices biased at 0.92 V and 0.96 V, respectively. (d) Stability test of the corresponding devices stored in a climate simulation box without encapsulation. 
To gain insight into the origins of the enhancement in the device performance, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the triple cation perovskite deposited on glass, pristine SnO2 and Ac-modified SnO2 substrates were measured. As shown in Fig. 7a, all the steady-state PL peaks of the samples are located at 763 nm. Both pristine SnO2 and Ac-modified SnO2 ETLs have an obvious quenching effect on the photoluminescence of perovskite. Moreover, Ac-modified SnO2/perovskite shows the lowest PL peak intensity, indicating the enhancement of charge extraction at the interface.35–37 Time-resolved PL measurements were conducted to further study the interfacial charge dynamic characteristics. The results are presented in Fig. 7b and summarized in Table S3†. The results are then fitted with a bi-exponential decay equation to obtain a fast decay (τ1) and a slow decay component (τ2). Generally, τ1 is attributed to the charge transfer at the interface and τ2 is assigned to the radiative recombination of carriers in the bulk of perovskite.38,39 For the pristine device, τ1 and τ2 are 4.83 ns and 22.15 ns. When using the Ac-modified SnO2, both τ1 and τ2 are decreased to 4.31 ns and 21.17 ns, respectively, revealing that the photo-generated electrons in the triple cation perovskite can be extracted more efficiently by the Ac-modified SnO2 film. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted to further characterize the role of acetic acid modification. Fig. S9† shows the corresponding Nyquist plots and the equivalent circuit, with the extracted parameters listed in Table S4†. Obviously, the Ac-modified device has smaller Rs and Ccon, indicating more effective electron transfer from the perovskite to the Ac-modified SnO2 ETL and less trap state density at the ETL/perovskite interface, respectively.8,40 Therefore, the alleviated charge accumulation and more effective electron extraction at the ETL/perovskite interface are the key reasons for the improvement of Jsc and FF.

(c) Vocversus light intensity of the corresponding triple cation PSCs. (d) Dark J–V curves of the electron-only devices with the VTFL kink points. The electron-only device structure is ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/Au. 

Fig. 7c shows a semi-logarithmic plot of the light intensity dependence of Voc for the pristine and Ac-modified devices, giving the main signature of trap-assisted recombination with a slope of S > kT/q, which should be equal to kT/q in the absence of trap-assisted recombination.41 The extracted slope decreases from 1.85 kT/q for the pristine device to 1.56 kT/q for the Ac-modified one, demonstrating the effective trap passivation of acetic acid treatment, helping to reduce the energy loss induced by the trap-assisted recombination. In addition, electron-only devices with the ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/Au structure were fabricated to characterize the trap density of perovskite deposited on different ETLs. Fig. 7d shows the dark J–V curves that consist of two slope regions, i.e. region I at low bias and region II at high bias. Region I indicates an ohmic-type response, showing a linear increase in the current injection at a lower bias. The current injection is then dramatically increased at region II (higher bias). The kink point obtained from the intersection of the two slopes from region I and region II is defined as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL).42 The trap density (Nt) can be calculated using the following equation:15 Nt = 2ε0εVTFL/eL2(2)where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite, e is the electron charge and L is the thickness of the film. The trap density of perovskite deposited on pristine SnO2 films is 1.32 × 1016 cm−3. When using the Ac-modified SnO2, the trap density is decreased to 7.99 × 1015 cm−3, confirming the effective passivation of electron traps through the Ac-modification. In order to study energy level alignment, ionization energy measurements were carried out to estimate the valence band (VB) of the ETLs.43 As shown in Fig. S10a and b,† the VB for pristine and Ac-modified SnO2 is −8.25 eV and −8.16 eV, respectively. The energy level diagram of the ETLs and the triple cation perovskite clearly indicates that the conduction band (CB) of Ac-modified SnO2 is closer to the CB of the triple cation perovskite (Fig. S10d†), which is beneficial to obtain a higher Voc.40 These results illustrate how the introduction of acetic acid can help passivate the defects at the ETL/perovskite interface, reduce the energy loss and contribute to the increase of Voc.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a facile strategy of passivating the surface of SnO2 has been demonstrated. After modification with acetic acid, the conductance of SnO2 is significantly enhanced without changing its surface properties and crystal structure. Through the interaction between acetic acid and SnO2, the trap density at the interface of SnO2/perovskite is decreased, which is confirmed by the SCLC model and light intensity dependent Voc. By optimizing the concentration of acetic acid, the average PCE is increased from the initial 18.57% to 20.33% and the champion device shows a PCE of 20.56%. In addition, the universality of this passivation strategy is confirmed by achieving an enhancement in the device performance from 19.52% to 21.64% when Ac-modified SnO2 is used to fabricate a dual cation PSC with the two-step deposition method. This work highlights a facile and universal method to passivate the SnO2/perovskite interface, which will undoubtedly promote the development of high-efficiency PSCs.

For the perovskite precursor, FAI (1.0 M), PbI2 (1.1M), MABr (0.2M) and PbBr2 (0.2M) were dissolved in a mixed organic solvent (DMF:DMSO = 4:1, v/v). Then, 45 μL of CsI solution (1.5 M, dissolved in DMSO) was added to the aforementioned perovskite precursor to obtain the final triple cation precursor solution.
For spiro-OMeTAD solution, 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in 1.0 mL chlorobenzene.

4.3 Device fabrication
ITO/glass substrates (10 Ω sq−1) were ultrasonic cleaned in detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone and ethanol for 30 min sequentially and treated with UV-ozone for 15 min afterward. SnO2 colloidal dispersion was spin-coated on the ITO/glass substrates at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 180 °C for 60 min under ambient conditions. Afterwards, the SnO2 coated substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 15 min and transferred into a glove box (<10.0 ppm of O2 and 0.1 ppm of H2O) to fabricate perovskite films. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated in a two-step program at a speed of 1000 rpm for 10 s and a speed of 5000 rpm for 30 s. 200 μL chlorobenzene was dropped on the substrates 10 seconds before the end of the program. After that, the films were annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 60 min. After cooling down to room temperature, spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 85 nm of gold electrode was thermally evaporated in an ultra-high-vacuum chamber integrated inside the glovebox.
4.4 Characterization
The J–V curves of the PSCs were measured using a Keithley 2602B source in a N2 filled glove box at room temperature under AM 1.5G condition at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, calibrated using a standard Si solar cell (PVM937, Newport). The light source was a 450 watt xenon lamp (Oriel solar simulator, 94023A). The active area of the PSCs is 0.17 cm−2, defined by a metal aperture. The J–V curves were tested both at forward scan (from −0.05 V to 1.25 V, step 0.04 V) and reverse scan (from 1.25 V to −0.05 V, step 0.04 V) without any pre-conditioning before the test. XPS measurements were performed on an AXIS ULTRA DLD (Kratos, Japan) X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The top-view SEM images were scanned using a field-emission SEM under an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. AFM images were acquired using a Bruker Multimode 8 in tapping mode. The absorption spectra were measured using an F20-UV thin-film analyzer at the wavelength range between 500 and 850 nm. XRD was carried out using a Bruker-AXS D8 system with Cu Kα as the radiation source. The EQE data were obtained using a quantum efficiency measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech) with a scan step of 5 nm. Steady-state PL spectra were achieved using a homemade system, which used a MAL-E 514 nm laser as the excitation light source. Time-resolved PL measurements were conducted by using an Edinburgh LP920, a laser flash photolysis spectrometer. EIS were measured using a ZAHNER CIMPS electrochemical workstation (SF300-A, Sciencetech Inc., Canada). IPS spectra were obtained using an ionization energy measurement system (IPS-4).
