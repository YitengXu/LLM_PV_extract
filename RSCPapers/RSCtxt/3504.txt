    , Accepted 22nd December 2020First published on 23rd December 2020AbstractFull-spectrum photocatalysis from ultraviolet to near infrared has generated immense scientific interest in environmental purification and energy conversion, which is still a huge challenge. Herein, we utilized a solution combustion method to prepare W18O49/N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) hybrid nanomaterials for full-spectrum photocatalytic degradation, which degraded organic dye molecules within a short reaction time (45 min) and demonstrated a high degradation rate (more than 90%) and a low initial concentration of degradation (50 mg L−1). Moreover, the relationship between irradiation light source, temperature, time, photocatalytic properties and photocatalytic mechanism of the degraded organic dye molecules have been investigated. This research afforded a full-spectrum photocatalyst for effectively removing organic dyes under any wavelength range of sunlight, whether UV, Vis or NIR light.
Highly effective utilization of solar energy in solar cells1 and photocatalysis2 has received considerable research interest as it is a clean and renewable source of energy. Since the pioneering work on TiO2 nanomaterials utilized ultraviolet (UV)-light energy for water photolysis,3 semiconductor photocatalysis demonstrates a promising application in energy conversion or environmental purification.4,5 To date, immense efforts have been devoted to improve photocatalytic efficiency via the development of new semiconductor photocatalysts with a wide response to visible (Vis) light and near-infrared (NIR) light, such as CdS,6 NiO,7 and ZnO,8 up-conversion composites,9 Bi2WO6/TiO210 and carbon quantum dots/Cu2(OH)PO4.11 However, their indirect utilization of NIR light or wavelength selective response is the barrier for the enhanced photocatalytic performance.12 Recently, the development of full-spectrum responsive photocatalysts provided an alternative opportunity to overcome the fundamental limitations. For example, WS2 nanowires proved to be effective for the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes in the full (UV-Vis-NIR) spectrum.12 However, the realization of a full spectrum photocatalyst with high performance exhibited utmost difficulty in practical applications, which was attributed to the low concentration and long reaction time to degrade dye molecules.
Tungsten-based semiconductors with their distinctive electronic structure demonstrated promising optoelectronic applications in photochromic materials,13 biomedical field,14 carrier transport layers,15 and photocatalysts.10,16 It is well known that low valence W5+ or W4+ can induce polaron transfers via hopping between two neighbouring non-equivalent W sites, resulting in desired NIR light response. For example, CsxWO3 nanorods coated with polyelectrolyte multilayers with strong NIR light absorption and excellent biocompatibility were applied for bimodal imaging-guided photothermal/photodynamic cancer treatment.14 Therefore, the tungsten oxide-based materials with low valence tungsten ions displayed a promising application prospect as NIR light photocatalysts. Notably, tungsten oxide (W18O49) nanomaterials demonstrated outstanding photocatalytic activities under UV-Vis-light.17 This indicates that W18O49 nanomaterials exhibit promising potential for application as full-spectrum responsive photocatalysts, which is still an undeveloped domain.
Two-dimensional (2D) carbon-based materials have numerous exceptional properties, including high electron mobility, theoretically high surface area, or high transparency. Hence, they were proved to be promising candidates for a wide range of applications via the construction of diverse composite materials.18–21 For example, Cu2O/rGO nanocomposites were employed for the visible-light-driven photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants.22 Furthermore, combining 2D carbon-based materials and semiconductor photocatalysts presented excellent synergistic effect, such as the enhancement of the NIR-light absorption characteristics23 and the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs of semiconductor photocatalysts,18 leading to high performance of photocatalysts. Herein, we rationally designed and prepared graphene-based photocatalysts of W18O49/N doped reduced graphene oxide (W18O49/N-rGO) via a solution combustion method for full-spectrum photocatalytic degradation. In the experiment, the degradation rates of the organic dye rhodamine B (RhB) reached 99.81% (UV light irradiation), 97.43% (Vis light irradiation) and 90.36% (NIR light irradiation). Significantly, the systematic investigation of the effect of temperature on the photocatalyst suggested that high temperature was beneficial for the high effect of the full-spectrum responsive photocatalyst based on W18O49/N-rGO. Furthermore, W18O49/N-rGO hybrid photocatalysts could be recycled with a degradation rate of 85.00% in the fifth cycle. This work will provide an innovative vision in rationally constructing graphene-based or tungsten-based hybrid nanomaterials for full-spectrum photocatalytic application.
The solution combustion method is a facile and versatile solution route for the design and synthesis of various inorganic nanomaterials, such as SnO2:Eu3+ nanorods,24 LaMnO3 nanocubes,25 and Sn1−xRExO2−x/2 nanorods.26 First, W18O49 nanorods, N-rGO nanosheets, and W18O49/N-rGO hybrid nanomaterials were prepared via a solution combustion method. The legible lattice fringe and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. S1c and d, ESI†) indicated high crystallinity. Besides, the lattice spacing of ∼0.378 nm can be assigned to the (010) lattice spacing of monoclinic W18O49. The corresponding X-ray diffractometry (XRD) pattern (Fig. 1i) displayed high crystallinity, which can be indexed to monoclinic W18O49 (JPCDS-84-1516). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings (Fig. S2c–e, ESI†) implied that W and O elements demonstrated an atomic ratio of W/O = 18:49. Furthermore, the XRD pattern (Fig. 1i) with an intense diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.20° verified the formation of rGO nanosheets. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the SEM images of the as-prepared rGO demonstrate a typical 2D morphology, and the corresponding EDS mappings present the obvious N element signal, suggesting the formation of N-rGO. The TEM images (Fig. 1a–c) clearly display that crystalline W18O49 nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the N-rGO nanosheets with high transparency. It was also found that the diameter of W18O49 nanoparticles was about 10–20 nm. Both the high-resolution TEM and SAED characterizations (Fig. 1c and d) confirmed the high-crystallinity feature of these as-prepared W18O49 nanoparticles on N-rGO nanosheets. The lattice spacing of ∼0.378 nm can be assigned to the (010) lattice spacing of monoclinic W18O49. The XRD pattern (Fig. 1i) contains representative diffraction peaks characteristic of both W18O49 and N-rGO, suggesting the successful formation of W18O49/N-rGO hybrid nanomaterials. The broadened diffraction peak characteristic was due to the distinct morphologies between the nanoparticles and nanorods and the reduced diameter.

(k) W 4f core level XPS spectra of W18O49/N-rGO. 
As shown in Fig. 1e–h, the representative element mapping images indicate the formation of W18O49/N-rGO hybrid nanomaterials. Compared with pure W18O49 nanorods, the Raman spectrum of W18O49/N-rGO hybrid nanomaterials (Fig. 1j) contained both G (1584 cm−1) and D bands (1352 cm−1),27 which are attributed to the vibration of sp2 and sp3 carbon atoms, thereby suggesting the presence of N-rGO.28 The characteristic Raman peak at 785 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching of O–W–O. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 1f and Fig. S5, ESI†) was applied to determine the chemical valence of tungsten in both pure W18O49 nanorods and W18O49/N-rGO hybrid nanomaterials. The W 4f core levels (Fig. 1k and Fig. S5b, ESI†) demonstrated the mixed bonding state of tungsten element. The main peaks with a W 4f7/2 at 36.1 eV and a W 4f5/2 at 38.35 eV (blue line) belong to W6+ ions. Likewise, the peaks with a W 4f7/2 at 36.7 eV and a W 4f5/2 at 34.35 eV (green line) are attributed to W5+ ions. The detailed investigation of the XPS peaks indicated the formation of non-stoichiometric tungsten oxide in both pure W18O49 nanorods and W18O49/N-rGO hybrid nanomaterials.
The optical absorptive property has great impact on evaluating whether a certain material is a promising photocatalyst or not. As shown in Fig. 1l, the absorbance spectrum (blue line) clearly reveals that W18O49 nanorods have a strong absorbance in response to UV light to Vis light. Furthermore, the absorptive property in the NIR-light region was also observed. This indicates that W18O49 nanorods are beneficial for full-spectrum-responsive photocatalytic degradation. The N-rGO nanosheets demonstrated the desired response to NIR light. Noticeably, the W18O49/N-rGO hybrid nanomaterial possessed a conducive optical absorptive property with full-spectrum response from UV light to Vis light, even to NIR light, making it a potential candidate for high-performance photocatalysis.
In order to evaluate the photocatalytic activity, 50 mg W18O49/N-rGO hybrid nanomaterial was added to 70 mL RhB solution (50 mg L−1) for photocatalytic reaction. First, the solution was stirred in the dark for 30 min at 30 °C to realize an absorption–desorption equilibrium, which was applied to eliminate the high adsorption effect of W18O49/N-rGO to RhB. Subsequently, the photocatalytic reaction commenced when a 300 W mercury lamp was employed as the UV light source. Likewise, a 300 W Xe lamp was utilized as the Vis-light or NIR-light source under the assistance of filters to ensure the wavelength of 400–800 nm and 800–1100 nm, respectively. It is well known that NIR light irradiation can be absorbed by water, which can lead to a heat conversion effect and cause thermolysis on the RhB species. To avoid such a heat effect, another beaker was filled with constant temperature circulating water to keep the reaction temperature constant. It can be observed from Fig. 2d that the reduction of RhB molecules can be negligible under illumination with no photocatalyst at 30 °C of circulating water insulation. Due to poor photocatalysis demonstrated by the single component carbon-based materials,29 the UV, Vis and NIR photocatalytic RhB degradation of W18O49 nanorods acts as control.

As shown in Fig. 2a, with the photocatalytic activities of W18O49 nanorods and W18O49/N-rGO under UV-light irradiation, the RhB concentration rapidly decreases to an equilibrium state. The reaction time to reach degradation equilibrium for W18O49/N-rGO was 45 min, which was less than that of 75 min for W18O49 nanorods. The degradation rates of RhB were 68.11% and 98.55% for W18O49 nanorods and W18O49/N-rGO, respectively. From Fig. 2b and c, it is observed that the degradation rates of RhB are 41.53% and 36.25% for W18O49 nanorods under the Vis light and NIR light irradiation, respectively. In addition, the degradation rates of RhB were 97.13% and 90.36% for W18O49/N-rGO under the Vis light and NIR light irradiation, respectively. Due to the low energy intensity of sunlight with long wavelength, the reaction time to reach degradation equilibrium for W18O49/N-rGO under UV light, Vis light, and NIR light irradiation are as follows: tUV-light (45 min) < tVis-light (70 min) < tNIR-light (80 min). Additionally, the initial concentration of RhB solution was 50 mg L−1, which was considerably lower than that mentioned in the other reports.10–12 The low reaction concentration and short degradation time lead to tremendous advantages for practical application in environmental purification. Remarkably, the rate of degradation of W18O49/N-rGO was faster than that of W18O49 nanorods under the full-spectrum light. W18O49 particles (their size being smaller than W18O49 nanorods) were uniformly distributed on the surface of N-rGO, which increased its contact with RhB molecules. Moreover, N-rGO possesses good electrical conductivity that can facilitate the transmission of photogenerated electrons. As shown in Fig. 2d, the W18O49/N-rGO nanocomposite demonstrates excellent photocatalytic activities for the degradation of RhB molecules under full spectrum irradiation and a temperature of 30 °C.
In the practical application of the photocatalyst, the extension of sunlight irradiation time will lead to an increase in the water temperature. Therefore, the photocatalytic activity of W18O49/N-rGO at temperatures of 15, 30, and 45 °C under UV, Vis and NIR irradiation were investigated, respectively. The temperature of the RhB solution was controlled by the recycled water. As shown in Fig. 3a–c, the removal rate of RhB improved with an increase in the temperature under different kinds of light. Under UV light irradiation, the degradation rates of RhB were 90.76%, 97.05%, and 100% at 15, 30, and 45 °C, respectively (Fig. 3a). This phenomenon can be explained as follows: the high temperature can improve the adsorption capacity of the 2D carbon-based nanomaterials, such as the GO nanosheets for Gd(III)28 and Pb(III).30 This indicated that the adsorption capacity of RhB on W18O49/N-rGO can be improved by increasing the temperature (Fig. S6a, ESI†). The increased adsorption capacity of the photocatalyst was helpful in realizing the high photocatalytic performance.31 Additionally, the high temperature was favorable to increase the transmission of the photogenerated carriers based on the photovoltaic effect of W18O49,32 which was crucial for the highly efficient photocatalytic effect. Furthermore, under Vis light irradiation, the degradation rates of RhB were 82.38%, 97.13%, and 100% at temperatures of 15, 30, and 45 °C, respectively (Fig. 3b). Under NIR light irradiation, the degradation rates of RhB were 57.16%, 90.36%, and 92.68% at temperatures of 15, 30, and 45 °C, respectively (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, it was clearly found that high temperature was favourable for the high efficiency of RhB degradation via the photocatalytic reaction in the full-spectrum region, particularly in the NIR region. In addition, Fig. 3d reveals the degradation curves of pure RhB solution under NIR light at different temperatures without a photocatalyst. Obviously, the degradation of the RhB molecule at different temperatures was almost negligible with no photocatalyst. W18O49/N-rGO also demonstrates a desirable recycling photocatalytic stability, as shown in Fig. 3e. W18O49/N-rGO was still able to remove 82.58% of RhB molecules after 5 catalytic cycles. These properties of W18O49/N-rGO made it extremely potential for its application as a full-spectrum photocatalyst.

The band gaps of W18O49 nanorod, N-rGO and W18O49/N-rGO samples are calculated based on Fig. 1l and the Tauc equation αhν = A(hν − Eg)n, where n = 2 for the allowed indirect transition.28 As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the value obtained by the intersection of the tangent of the three curves and the abscissa axis is the bandgap width of the corresponding sample. The fitting result shows that the Eg of W18O49 nanorods, N-rGO and W18O49/N-rGO reached 1.70, 1.31 and 1.42 eV, respectively. Due to the electron transfer from W6+ to W5+, the oxygen-deficient WOx (nonstoichiometric) were mostly found to be light green, which was caused by an additional broad absorption peak in the red to infrared region and an Eg of 1.70 eV.33,34 There were doped chemical bonds and composite interactions between the graphene-based materials and the inorganic photocatalysts in their hybrid complex nanomaterials.35 Furthermore, these doped chemical bonds and composite interactions were able to decrease the energy gap,36,37 thereby leading to a desired photocatalysis at a near-infrared band. Because the upper limit of the band gap required for Vis and NIR response is 1.77 eV, W18O49 nanorods and W18O49/N-rGO were both full-spectrum-responsive photocatalysts. In addition, it can be seen from the transient photocurrent curves of W18O49/N-rGO under UV, Vis and NIR irradiation, respectively (Fig. S8, ESI†) that the surface of W18O49/N-rGO can generate photocurrent under any kind of illumination when the light source was turned on. After turning off the light power for 30 seconds, the current signal gradually weakened. Afterwards, restarting the light source caused the photocurrent response of the sample to occur again. Hence, the results of this experiment showed that the sample W18O49/N-rGO can generate electron hole pairs throughout the solar spectrum, which is the most critical step in photocatalysis. During the process of photocatalysis, tungsten oxide-based photocatalysts mainly produced superoxide anions (˙O2−), hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) and other active substances.16,38 In order to further determine the mechanism of NIR-light photocatalysis, we introduced a series of active species scavengers to the photocatalytic processes. When the system was saturated with nitrogen and under NIR irradiation, the degradation rate of RhB reduced to 50% (Fig. S6b, ESI†), which indicates that oxygen plays an important role in the photocatalytic process; in other words, oxygen can be used as an electron trap to produce ˙O2−, which is one of the important active species during the process of photocatalysis. Furthermore, the addition of 1.0 mM sodium oxalate (h+ acceptor) decreased the degradation rate of RhB. With the addition of the ˙OH quenching agent isopropanol, the degradation rate of RhB decreased by more than 20%, which means that hydroxyl could also play a role in the reaction. On this basis, a possible mechanism of the photocatalytic activity of W18O49/N-rGO driven by NIR light could be proposed. W5+ + hν(UV, Vis, NIR) → W6+ + e−(1) e− + O2 → ˙O2− + H+ → ˙OOH →→ ˙OH(2) ˙O2− + ˙OH → 1O2 + OH−(3) W6+ + OH− → W5+ + ˙OH(4) ˙O2−, ˙OH, 1O2 + RhB → Degradation of RhB(5)
The schematic diagram (Fig. 4) was employed to clearly illustrate the mechanism of full-spectrum response of the W18O49/N-rGO hybrid nanomaterials. Due to the low Eg of 1.42 eV, W18O49/N-rGO hybrid nanomaterials demonstrated a prominent full-spectrum (UV–vis–NIR light) absorption. When W18O49/N-rGO was irradiated by sunlight, the W5+ sites will be excited by photogenerated electrons as a chromophore or photosensitive sites to produce W6+ sites (eqn (1)). Subsequently, photogenerated electrons could be adsorbed by O2 in the RhB solution to form ˙O2− and then generate ˙OH, ˙OOH and 1O2 (eqn (2) and (3)). In the process of the above reaction, N-rGO acts as an electron acceptor capturing electrons, which effectively prevents the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes and improves the photocatalytic activity.39,40 Moreover, the excess electrons can reduce O2 on the surface of the N-rGO layer to ˙O2− and promote the progress of the reaction. On the other hand, the W6+ sites can react with OH− and return to the W5+ sites, thus achieving a complete photocatalytic circle (eqn (4)). Lastly, all the active species including ˙OH, ˙OOH and 1O2, have adequate energy to oxidize the dyes (eqn (5)). Therefore, the low valence W5+ sites are the absorption source of sunlight and free electrons can be produced near the W5+ sites, and then the reactive oxygen species will be formed and used in the photo-degradation of RhB molecules.
 Fig. 4  Illustrative diagram of the W18O49/N-rGO system under NIR light irradiation. 
The N-rGO layers play four important roles for W18O49/N-rGO hybrid nanomaterials with an excellent performance of full-spectrum photocatalytic degradation, as verified in Fig. 4. First, the high electron mobility of the N-rGO layers is beneficial to enhance the transmission of photogenerated electrons and the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which effectively improves the photocatalytic activity.31,32 Second, the existence of the N-rGO layers in the complex photocatalyst is helpful for improving their absorption regions and the intensity of sunlight. Third, the N-rGO layers possess large specific surface area with abundant oxygen/nitrogen-containing functional groups, which is favorable for an excellent adsorbability of metal ions or organic molecules.30 Due to the excellent adsorbability, RhB molecules can be rapidly transferred to the surface of W18O49 nanoparticles, leading to an enhanced oxidation–reduction process for degrading the dye molecules. Lastly, the N-rGO layers can effectively prevent the agglomeration of W18O49 nanoparticles, which is advantageous to keep enough active sites for photocatalytic reaction.
Conclusions
In summary, we successfully designed and prepared W18O49/N-rGO hybrid nanomaterials via a solution combustion method for full-spectrum photocatalysis. The degradation rates of RhB were 98.55%, 97.13%, and 90.36% after photocatalysis using W18O49/N-rGO under UV light, Vis light, and NIR light irradiation, respectively. Short reaction time and low initial concentration (50 mg L−1) are favourable for practical application in environmental purification. The high temperature could increase the photocatalytic efficiency. Furthermore, the mechanism of photocatalysis of W18O49/N-rGO in full-spectrum region was investigated. The low valence W5+ sites played a key role in the absorption source of NIR light, and the N-rGO nanosheets could effectively prevent the recombination of electrons and holes. This work opened a door to effectively remove organic dyes by using W18O49/N-rGO under any wavelength range of sunlight, whether UV, Vis or NIR light.
Experimental
Synthesis of graphene oxide pseudosolution
Graphene oxide was synthesized by an improved Hummers’ method,41 and the process steps were as follows. First, 2.5 g NaNO3 and 5 g natural flake graphite were added to concentrated H2SO4 at 0 °C by keeping the reaction vessel in an ice bath, then mixed and stirred at a temperature below 5 °C for 30 minutes. Next, 20 g KMnO4 was added to the mixture slowly and stirred for 30 minutes, and the temperature of the process was also maintained below 30 °C with the use of an ice bath. Following this, 200 mL deionized water was added to the mixture at a temperature lower than 50 °C, then the mixture was heated to 85 °C and 100 °C while stirring for 20 minutes. Thereafter, 600 mL deionized water and 30% H2O2 were added in turn until the solution color changed to bright yellow. On this basis, the solution was treated by ultrasonic vibration for 30 minutes and was allowed to rest for 24 hours. Then, the supernatant was poured out, and HCl (the proportion was VHCl:Vwater = 1:10) aqueous solution was added. After 30 minutes of ultrasonic vibration, it was allowed to stand for 24 hours. Subsequently, the supernatant was poured out, and the mixture was washed with deionized water continuously several times. It was then left for 24 hours until the mixture was delaminated. Finally, the dialysis bag containing the mixture was put into deionized water until the pH value of the dialysate changed to about 6.0. During this period, the gravimetric method was used to calibrate the concentration.
Synthesis of W18O49 nanorods and W18O49/N-rGO hybrid nanomaterials
3.048 g AMT, 2.880 g NH4NO3 and 1.250 g glycine were added to 50 mL distilled water. Meanwhile, 10.1 mL GO solution (0.01584 g mL−1) was added to 50 mL distilled water, forming a uniform colloid after an ultrasonic concussion process for 30 min. Then, the above two solutions were mixed to obtain the stock solution. After concentrating the stock solution into sol solution (less than 20 mL) via a thermal treatment, the sol solution was transferred into a porcelain plate and placed in a muffle furnace for further heat treatment at 500 °C, leading to the precursor. Finally, the precursor was placed in the tube furnace with 5% H2/N2 under 700 °C annealing for 2 hours to prepare W18O49/N-rGO. W18O49 nanorods were prepared in the absence of GO, and N-rGO was synthesized without AMT via a similar procedure.
Evaluation of photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic activities of W18O49 nanorods and W18O49/N-rGO under UV, Vis and NIR light were investigated by their degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB, 50 mg L−1). In this experiment, a 300 W mercury lamp was used as the UV light source. Meanwhile, a 500 W long-arc Xe lamp was applied as the simulated sunlight, with a light cutoff filter to ensure Vis light of 400–800 nm and NIR light of 800–1100 nm, respectively. At the beginning of the measurement, 50 mg W18O49/N-rGO powder was added to 70 mL RhB solution (50 mg L−1). Then, the mixed solution was kept under magnetic stirring in the dark for 30 min to establish an adsorption–desorption equilibrium of RhB over the photocatalyst. After this, 3 mL mixed solution was collected under different light irradiations, respectively. Then, they were centrifuged at a rate of 8000 rpm, and the concentration of the supernatant RhB was analyzed with a UV-Vis spectrometer (Hitachi U-4100). The temperature of the RhB solution during the photocatalytic process was maintained at 30 °C by circulating warm water. On the other hand, in order to study the photocatalytic properties of W18O49/N-rGO at different temperatures, the temperature of the circulating warm water was changed to 15, 30 and 45 °C, respectively. Moreover, the temperature of the RhB solutions was also changed to the corresponding level. The other conditions in the photocatalytic process of W18O49/N-rGO were the same as mentioned above.
