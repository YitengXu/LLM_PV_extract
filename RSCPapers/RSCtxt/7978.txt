    First published on 19th November 2019AbstractNitrogen is a fundamental constituent for all living creatures on the Earth and modern industrial society. The current nitrogen industry is largely powered by fossil fuels with huge energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission, and nitrogen pollution in surface water bodies induced by the indiscriminate discharge of industrial and domestic wastewater has become a worldwide environmental concern. Electrochemical techniques for nitrogen fixation and transformation under mild conditions are promising approaches to meet the challenge of efficiently managing and balancing the nitrogen cycle, where the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts from both structural and compositional aspects down to the nanoscale plays the most essential role. Herein, important nitrogen species including dinitrogen (N2), ammonia (NH3) and hydrazine (N2H4), their transformation processes between each other including the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), and research progress on the development of related electrocatalysts are systematically summarized, aiming at establishing a general picture of the whole nitrogen cycle instead of a certain single reaction. Strategies combining theoretical computations and experimental optimizations are proposed to improve the catalytic performance including activity, efficiency, selectivity and stability, finally contributing to a self-sufficient and carbon-free “green” nitrogen economy.

1. Introduction
Nitrogen plays an indispensable role in life on Earth, constituting the basic building blocks of organisms, such as nucleotides and proteins.1 However, the naturally abundant dinitrogen in the atmosphere is chemically inert and cannot be directly utilized by human beings unless transformed into a more reactive form by the nitrogen fixation process, either reductive or oxidative.2 Almost all the nitrogen harvested by humans comes from biological nitrogen fixation by microbes3,4 before Haber and Bosch invented an industrial process to reduce N2 into NH3via fossil fuel converted H2 in the early 1900s.5 The invention of the H–B process is believed to be the single most important invention of the 20th century,6 which fundamentally changed the landscape of agriculture and human society, contributing to the explosive global population growth during the past hundred years.7 Even today, this single reaction still feeds ∼80% of the global population, constituting 50% of the N atoms in human body. However, this important reaction is highly energy-intensive, consuming 1–2% of the global annual energy output, accompanied by a huge consumption of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases (over 300 million metric tons of CO2 annually).8,9
Started with the H–B process, a whole industrial nitrogen transformation system has been established, contributing to the flourishing modern industrial society. These anthropogenic activities finally lead to the discharge of waste nitrogen into the environment, mostly in the form of ammonia into surface water, while the corresponding countermeasure is much less developed, pushing the natural nitrogen cycle off balance.7,10 Consequently, the presence of nitrogen pollutants in water bodies has become a worldwide environmental issue, threating the health of millions of people and the total global ecosystem.11,12 Considering the huge energy input and carbon emission of the H–B process and the widespread nitrogen water contamination, the US National Academy of Engineering has enlisted the efficient management of nitrogen fixation and transformation and balance of the natural nitrogen cycle as one of the 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st century.13
A complete nitrogen cycle starts with the reductive (or oxidative, as a minor concern) fixation of atmospheric dinitrogen, mostly into ammonia, followed by a series of transformations between different nitrogen forms and finally the degradation of fixed nitrogen species back into air to form a closed circulation. Ammonia, nitrogen oxides (denoted here as NOx for neutral and NOy for both neutral and ionic nitrogen oxides) plus zero-valent dinitrogen, and their transformation between each other constitute the major part of this nitrogen cycle.4,10,14 In nature, this cycle is mostly conducted inside different microbes. Nitrogen is first reduced by the enzyme nitrogenase in a range of microbes known as azotobacters into ammonia,3 which is either consumed by organisms as building blocks of biotic molecules, discharged in other forms (such as urea) after metabolism, or transformed by the nitrification process by microbes into higher oxidized forms and finally into the most oxidized nitrate.15,16 Nitrates (and other ionic nitrogen oxides such as nitrites) are then degraded following the denitrification process inside microbes back into gaseous dinitrogen.4,17 Direct nitrogen oxidation is highly inhibitive both kinetically and thermodynamically, as evidenced by the fact that no known organisms have evolved an enzyme capable of oxidative nitrogen fixation, and natural abiotic sources of nitrogen oxides such as lightning and volcanic activity only contribute to a minor part of the total nitrates generated.
Industrial nitrogen transformation follows a similar pattern, starting with H–B ammonia synthesis and following Ostwald process to oxidize the as-synthesized ammonia into nitric acid.18 Actually, the first successful commercial nitrogen fixation process before the H–B process was the hot-plasma-driven direct oxidation of N2 into NO by high-temperature arc discharge, known as the Birkeland–Edye process (B–E process),19 at the beginning of the 20th century. Soon after its invention, Norsk Hydro established their first facility utilizing the B–E process to produce nitric acid in Norway in 1905. However, the B–E process consumed a huge amount of electricity, which was only applicable in a few regions such as Norway with rich and cheap hydroelectric resources, and was hence eliminated by the economically more competitive H–B process. Ammonia and nitric acid are among the most produced chemicals by humans, with an estimated worldwide total production of 150 and 50 million metric tons, respectively, in 2017.20 Ammonia is dominantly produced by the H–B process which operates at a high temperature (300–500 °C) and pressure (100–300 atm). The high-purity hydrogen required for the reaction is produced by the steam reforming of fossil fuels, mainly natural gas, and most of the energy input and carbon emission originate from the gas making and following complicated purification steps for hydrogen production.8 The produced ammonia is mainly used to produce fertilizers and as a feedstock for a series of downstream industries, either nitrogen-related or not, such as the production of urea and soda ash, and synthesis of medicine.7 Despite the fact that hundreds of millions of metric tons of nitrogen is fixed from the air every year, and a large amount of it is discharged into the environment, elimination of this hazard pollutant mainly relies on natural degradation by microbes. Thus, the pursuit of effective, eco-friendly and economically competitive approaches to conduct the major reactions of nitrogen transformation is the key point to meet the grand challenge of managing the nitrogen cycle.
Electrochemical technologies are believed to be an essential part of a future global carbon-free green energy system.21,22 Compared with the state-of-the-art internal combustion engines with low efficiency limited by the theoretical upper limit of the Carnot cycle, a fuel cell (FC) directly converting chemical energy into electricity via electrochemical processes can reach 100% efficiency of energy utilization, while the fuels needed can be produced by electrolyzers powered by renewable energy. Although an electrochemical reaction is influenced by many factors, the catalyst used is certainly the most essential. In the past two decades, important energy-related electrochemical reactions including the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) have attracted tremendous attention with great progress in the development of electrocatalysts.21–26 However, in terms of nitrogen-related electrocatalysis, its development has been quite sluggish for a long period due to the slow progress in the design of catalysts for the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia, which is the start and core of the whole electrochemical nitrogen cycle, but this has changed in the last few years, especially after 2017. With the great achievements in the field of the NRR in the last two years, other related nitrogen electrocatalytic transformation reactions may also receive increasing research interest in the effort to build a complete electrochemical nitrogen cycle. Currently, there is only a few successful examples of direct nitrogen electrooxidation, and herein the discussion will not include the “upper” branch of the nitrogen cycle (the cycle between N2 and NOy) since a closed loop cannot be formed. Instead, we focus on the reductive branch between N2 and reduced hydronitrogens, typically ammonia (NH3) and hydrazine (N2H4) as two important species in the field of both energy and the environment. The important reactions involved include the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Since hydrazine is industrially produced from ammonia, there is no practical significance to investigate the reduction of hydrazine back into ammonia. Although some review papers have been published focusing on a specific aspect of the nitrogen electrocatalysis such as NRR27,28 or AOR,29,30 there is no systematic discussion of the integral nitrogen reduction and transformation cycle. The three important nitrogen transformation reactions are tightly connected with each other, sharing the same set of intermediates, as will be shown in the following parts. The different reaction pathways result in distinct requirements of catalysts; however, some general ideas can be applied to the design of catalysts, especially the established intermediate linear scaling relations can be applied to all three reactions. The chemical composition and structural regulation down to the nanoscale both play crucial roles in the catalytic performance (Fig. 1). Rational design guided by theoretical calculations and delicate control of morphology during the synthesis of catalysts should open the door to highly efficient electrochemical nitrogen fixation and transformation towards a future carbon-free nitrogen economy.31–34
 Fig. 1  Design of electrocatalysts plays an essential role in the electrocatalytic transformation (NRR, AOR, and HzOR) between the three major nitrogen species (N2, NH3, and N2H4, respectively). Compositional control and structural modulation down to the nanoscale are two important aspects in catalyst design. 
In this review, we comprehensively summarize the progress in the field of nitrogen electrocatalysis from a material point of view, focusing on the design and synthesis of electrocatalysts, especially the construction of novel nanostructures to improve catalytic performance. We focus on the nitrogen cycle between three major nitrogen species, elemental dinitrogen, ammonia and hydrazine, and their transformation reactions between each other, including the NRR, AOR and HzOR. Based on the thermodynamics of nitrogen, we introduce catalyst design strategies considering the limitation of the linear scaling relations and kinetics of the reaction pathways. As the most important nitrogen transformation reaction, electrochemical nitrogen reduction for ammonia synthesis will be the focus, especially the breaking progress in the last two years, while the concurrent research on the AOR and HzOR will also be introduced as complements. As is known, for the design of electrocatalysts, structural modulation is of the same importance as compositional control, especially for the complicated nitrogen electrocatalytic reactions, which are highly shape- and surface-sensitive. By understanding the underlying mechanistic connections, we want to build an integral picture of the whole nitrogen cycle instead of a single reaction. Such understanding will finally lead to the prospect of a global carbon-free green energy network based on nitrogen and hydrogen electrocatalysis, which can remedy the unbalanced natural nitrogen balance and concomitant environmental crisis.
2. Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR)
Since the direct oxidation of nitrogen is extremely difficult, the phrase “nitrogen fixation” generally refers to the reduction of nitrogen into ammonia or ammonia synthesis. Ammonia synthesis is the foundation of the whole nitrogen transformation cycle in both nature and industry. Ammonia is the key for modern agriculture and food production, with more than 80% of the as-synthesized ammonia directly used to produce nitrogen fertilizers to support the rapidly growing global population. It is also an essential feedstock for various important chemicals including nitric acid, explosives and almost all medicines. For millions of years, the only approach for human to acquire ammonia was biological nitrogen fixation by azotobacters before the invention of the industrial Haber–Bosch process in the early 1900s. Over the past century, the H–B process has dominated the ammonia production by human beings, literally changing the world with its great impact on agriculture, industry and modern history, together with its enormous environmental influence, which is mostly hazardous.7 It is estimated that about half of the current global population feeds on the H–B nitrogen. However, with the ever-growing demand for ammonia, the depleting supply of fossil fuels and increasingly serious environmental crisis, this pattern will become unsustainable in the near future, and thus development of alternative approaches for more efficient ammonia production under milder conditions is highly urgent.10,12 In this context, electrochemical catalytic processes for nitrogen reduction into ammonia based on renewable energy instead of fossil fuels are one of the most promising candidates for more “green” ammonia production.
Early efforts on the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia date back to 1969, where van Tamelen and Seeley presented the first example of electrochemical nitrogen reduction in a molecular titanium–aluminum system.35 However, the system exhibited ultralow efficiency, and the aluminum anode was consumed during the reaction, making it an unsustainable reaction. The first demonstration of a continuous electrochemical ammonia synthesis process was reported in 1998 by Iwahara and coworkers in a proton-conductive solid-electrolyte-based cell from elemental gas reactants under high temperature, called the Solid State Ammonia Synthesis (SSAS).36 This process is more likely an improved version of the traditional H–B process, although it essentially reduced the reaction pressure to ambient by counterbalancing the electricity consumption. Subsequently, efforts were made to replace the fossil-fuel originated hydrogen with water and to reduce the hash reaction conditions. For example, in the work by Licht et al. in 2013,37 nitrogen was reduced with water steam by electrocatalysis in a molten hydroxide suspension of nano-Fe2O3 at an intermediate temperature of 200–250 °C. However, these processes conducted in solid electrolyte or molten eutectics still operate at temperatures well-above room temperature. In the last few years, inspired by the blooming research on hydrogen fuel cells and related aqueous electrocatalysis such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER),22,23 ammonia synthesis by the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) based on nanostructured electrocatalysts in aqueous solution and ambient conditions has become a converging research frontier. An ideal ammonia synthesis electrolyzer operates at room temperature and ambient pressure, feeding from water and atmospheric nitrogen and powered by electricity generated from sustainable sources such as solar, wind, geothermal or wave/tide energy. Modern H–B plants are highly integrated large-scale facilities, which require intensive feeding of capitals and fuels, while transportation and shipping costs cannot be neglected.38 These conditions are particularly hard to meet for developing countries and regions with a rapidly growing population and poor industry and transportation level, for example, in the whole East Africa there are no large-scale ammonia production facilities. Comparatively, the scale of electrolyzers can be easily changed depending on the situation, from integrated large-scale industrial production to distributed applications such as portable and point-of-use (POU) equipment. However, development of this type of device is still a great challenge, primarily due to the absence of a highly efficient electrocatalysts. In this section, we focus on the electrochemical NRR in aqueous solution at room temperature and ambient pressure, which should be the future trend of research in this field. For a better understanding, the related industrial H–B and biological ammonia synthesis will be briefly introduced first, with following discussion of electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction from a material point of view, emphasizing on potential strategies to enhance catalyst performance in terms of Faraday efficiency, ammonia yield rate, selectivity and energy efficiency by innovative catalyst design with advanced nanostructures.
2.1. Industrial and biological ammonia synthesis
Although nitrogen feedstock can be easily acquired from the most abundant dinitrogen molecules in the atmosphere, the source of hydrogen atoms is a critical issue. In the long term, only water or hydrocarbons including fossil fuels and biomass can meet the need for continuous, large-scale ammonia production. From a thermodynamic point of view, utilization of hydrocarbons as the hydrogen source is substantially superior than water in terms of energy consumption, even for the direct synthesis of NH3 skipping the water splitting step, as shown in Fig. 2.20 However, the ineluctable carbon emission of this process makes hydrocarbons much less favored considering the atom economy and environmental compatibility. At this point, nature and industry choose distinct paths. In the Haber–Bosch process, nitrogen is reduced by molecular dihydrogen (eqn (1)), which originates from the steam reforming of fossil fuels, mainly methane from natural gas.8 This reaction is thermodynamically favorable at room temperature, with a Gibbs free energy of −32.9 kJ mol−1 N2. In reality, this reaction proceeds with a huge kinetic barrier due to the inertness of dinitrogen, and the presence of heterocatalysts and high temperature is necessary to break the triple bond of nitrogen molecules to reach significant ammonia production rates. Dictated by Le Chatelier's principle, an increase in temperature leads to disfavored equilibrium positions with a low conversion yield of ammonia, and thus high pressure is applied as a trade-off to compensate the equilibrium shift. Limited by the activity of commercial multi-promoted fused iron catalysts, industrial H–B plants generally operate at 300–500 °C and 200–300 atm, which result in additional energy consumption and capital cost of infrastructure and potential safety issues. The newer KAAP (Kellogg Advanced Ammonia Process) using an Ru–C catalyst can be conducted under a relatively lower pressure (<100 atm), but it is still well-above ambient conditions.39 Since a high-purity reactant gas stream is required to avoid catalyst poisoning and deactivation, thorough purification processes are needed for the steam-reformed gas mixtures to remove impurities such as residual CO2, CO and H2S. All these steps including hydrogen production, complicated purification of reactant gas mixture and following compression and heating require a large energy input, which is currently met by fossil fuels. Consequently, the H–B process is extremely energy- and carbon-emission intensive, with an average energy consumption of 485 kJ mol−1 and carbon emission of 1.9 t(CO2)/t(NH3) (∼3CO2 per 8NH3).8,40 Even if a water-splitting electrolyzer is utilized as a replacement for the hydrogen supply, the substantially large energy for water splitting and the H–B reaction itself is still unavoidable. Thus, the optimal approach is direct ammonia synthesis from nitrogen and water under benign conditions, avoiding the H–B process altogether. N2 + 3H2 ⇌ 2NH3(1)Although about 150 million metric tons of ammonia is produced annually by the industrial H–B process, the natural process by nitrogen fixation bacteria produces over 200 million metric tons of NH3 each year.4 Unlike the H–B process, natural biological nitrogen reduction occurs under much milder conditions under ambient pressure and room temperature in aqueous media, following a different pathway, where nitrogen is directly reduced by the transfer of multiple protons and electron pairs instead of atomic hydrogen (eqn (2)).41 Catalyzed by the metalloenzymes called nitrogenases, the reduction of nitrogen follows a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism42 and proceeds at room temperature, which benefits the equilibrium, but still a significant energy input is required, which is supplied by ATP. For the most studied nitrogenase, the typical FeMo cofactor, 8 ATP molecules are consumed per NH3 molecule, corresponding to an energy consumption of 244 kJ mol−1, which is lower than that by the H–B process.41 The structure of the nitrogenase FeMo cofactor consists of an Mo-based metal cluster containing Mo, Fe, S, C and a homocitrate, where one Fe adjacent to Mo is hypothesized to be the binding site of dinitrogen.43,44 It should be noted that hydrogen is produced stoichiometrically to ammonia formation in the enzymatic nitrogen reduction,3 and deeper studies including isotope labeling experiments indicated that hydrogen evolution is an intrinsic phenomenon rather than a side reaction.45,46 N2 + 8H+ + 8e− + 16ATP ⇌ 2NH3 + H2 + 16ADP + 16Pi(2)

2.2. Reaction mechanisms of electrocatalytic NRR

2.2.1. Electrochemistry of the NRR. 
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction in aqueous solution is a proton-coupled electron transfer reaction involving a 6-electron complete reduction process into two ammonia molecules per dinitrogen molecule or a 4-electron side reaction into hydrazine, making the NRR a more complicated process than the 4-electron ORR/OER and 2-electron HER/HOR. Actually, most of the previous reports were either ambiguous about the NRR onset potential or used a non-equilibrium potential assuming certain nitrogen and ammonia partial pressures. In some rare cases where the standard equilibrium NRR onset potential was discussed, mostly an onset potential corresponding to the formation of gaseous NH3 was proposed (standard equilibrium potential of eqn (3) is calculated from standard molar Gibbs free energy of formation, ΔfG0(NH3,g) = −16.7 kJ mol−1).47 N2(g) + 6H+ + 6e− ⇌ 2NH3(g) E0 = +0.0577 V vs. RHE(3)Considering that ammonia is highly soluble in aqueous media and is a moderate Brønsted base, the energetic contribution from dissolution–hydration and protonation of ammonia hydrate is not negligible, especially in acid electrolyte, which is the case for many published works (Table 1). NH3(g) + H2O(l) ⇌ NH3·H2O(aq.) ΔrG0m = −247.23 kJ mol−1(4) NH4+(aq.) + H2O(l) ⇌ NH3·H2O(aq.) + H+ pKa = 9.25(5)Considering the above factors, the standard equilibrium potentials for N2 reduction into NH3 or NH4+ in relation with pH are shown below as well as in the Pourbaix diagram of the N2–H2O system in Fig. 3.20,48 The existing form of ammonia depends on the pH of the solution, where at pH ≥ 9.25, ammonia exists in its molecular form (NH3), and at pH < 9.25, ionic ammonium (NH4+) is the major form. For hydrazine, the case is similar, where the boundary is 6.07.

As shown above, the potentials of nitrogen electrocatalytic reactions are sensitive to pH. If kinetic factors are not considered, nitrogen reduction into ammonia is more thermodynamically favored than hydrogen evolution with higher onset potentials throughout the whole pH range, where more acidic media seem more beneficial in terms of onset potential, while under basic conditions, the potentials of ammonia formation and hydrogen reduction are very close. An area exists between the N2–NH3 line and H2O–H2 line, where theoretically only NRR takes place to avoid the HER completely. However, as will be shown below, due to nonequilibrium conditions especially in the initial stage of the reaction, the actual HER onset potential may shift positively due to the low hydrogen gas partial pressure according to Nernst equation, still leading to a low ammonia coulombic efficiency. On the other hand, the formation of hydrazine from nitrogen is much less favored with more negative potentials, where still acidic conditions are favored.
The initial electrochemical step of the NRR is the transfer of the very first electron to an adsorbed N2 admolecule on the catalyst surface, with or without the assistance of a proton. The equilibrium potential of this step is also estimated as follows:49,50 N2(g) + H+ + e− ⇌ N2H(g) E0 ≈ −3.2 V vs. RHE(11)N2(g) + e− ⇌ N2−(aq.) E0 ≈ −4.16 V vs. NHE or E0 ≈ −3.37 V vs. RHE at pH = 14(12)These potentials are for independent reactions in solution without the promotion of a catalytic surface. Nevertheless, their negative potentials indicate an intrinsic high energy barrier for the initial hydrogenation step, and hence thermodynamic difficulty for electrochemical nitrogen reduction.


2.2.2. Reaction pathways of the NRR. 
Similarly to other catalytic processes, the reaction process of catalytic NRR involves three fundamental steps: (i) adsorption of dinitrogen molecules on catalytic active sites, (ii) cleavage of the nitrogen triple bonds and hydrogenation of dinitrogen, and (iii) desorption of the as-formed ammonia molecules (or other intermediate products) from the catalyst surface. In the case of electrocatalysis, the hydrogenation of dinitrogen is accomplished by consecutive proton and electron transfer, with the electrolyte as the proton source and electron feeding on the current passing through the cathode. Depending on different hydrogenation (protonation and reduction) and NN bond cleavage sequences, generally two types of mechanisms are proposed: (i) the dissociative pathway and (ii) the associative pathway, as shown in Fig. 4.28,51,52 In the dissociative pathway, nitrogen bond cleavage occurs upon dinitrogen adsorption on the catalyst surface prior to any hydrogenation, leaving two adsorbed N-adatoms, which then undergo hydrogenation independently and are released from the catalyst as NH3. In the associative pathway, nitrogen bond cleavage occurs simultaneously with hydrogenation. Assuming an end-on coordination mode for most catalyst surfaces, where only one N atom in the dinitrogen molecule is coordinated with the catalyst surface site, the association pathway can be further classified into two pathways, i.e. the distal and alternative pathways. In the distal pathway, which was firstly proposed in the Schrock cycle for a molecular Mo-complex,53 the uncoordinated N atom to the far end is preferably hydrogenated until complete cleavage of the N–N bond, and released as one mole of NH3, leaving an N-adatom on the catalyst surface for further hydrogenation. In the alternative pathway, hydrogenation proceeds on the two nitrogen atoms, and the N–N bond is not broken until the last step, releasing two moles of NH3 consecutively. In the case of biological nitrogenases and some catalysts that bind nitrogen strongly, dinitrogen molecules bond with the catalyst surface at two ends instead of one in a side-on mode and hydrogenated in an alternative fashion called the enzymatic pathway.51 It should be noted that following the above discussion, the formation of hydrazine (N2H4) is only possible as an intermediate following an alternative (including enzymatic) pathway, and desorption of *N2H4 from the catalyst surface is usually a highly endergonic step, making N2H4 mostly a minor product.
 Fig. 4  Reaction pathways for the NRR by proton-coupled electron transfer, including the dissociative pathway, distal and alternative associative pathway, and enzymatic pathway. 
Experimental identification of the actual reaction mechanism is very difficult due to the weak interaction, low coverage and rapid transformation of intermediates on the catalyst surface. Recently, surface-sensitive spectroscopic methods such as surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIAS) have shed some light on this topic. Using SEIAS, the NN stretching band of the *N2Hx (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) intermediates (∼1940 cm−1) were detected on Ru film electrodes in an N2-saturated HClO4 electrolyte at potentials below 0.2 V, and a significant increase in the coverage of *N2Hx species was observed as the negative potential increased, while no N-related bands were observed in 0.1 M KOH.54 Similar bands were also detected for Au in 0.1 M KOH.55 Nevertheless, the development of more in situ and operando characterization techniques with higher chemical sensitivity and time resolution is needed for deeper understanding of the actual NRR mechanism.
Abghoui and Skúlason proposed the Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism specifically for electrochemical nitrogen reduction on the surface of transition metal nitrides (TMNs),56–60 inspired by the catalytic oxidation on the surface of vanadium oxide.61 Different from the routine dissociative and associative pathways, in the typical MvK mechanism, first the formation of NH3 is achieved by the hydrogenation of an N atom on the TMN surface, creating an N-vacancy.56,57 The N-vacancy is replenished by the N2 dissolved in the electrolyte, followed by reduction of another surface N atom to give a second NH3 to complete the catalytic cycle. The MvK process can also proceed in three different ways according to the reaction sequence after the release of the first NH3. In the dissociative manner, the gaseous N2 directly dissociates, healing the N-vacancy and forming an N-adatom on top of a nearby metal atom, which is further hydrogenated to give a second NH3. The N2 may also bind to the vacancy without dissociation and be directly protonated in a distal manner until the complete cleavage of the N–N bonds and release the dangling N atom as an NH3 to close the cycle. If coordination of N2 to the first N-vacancy is endothermic, the reaction may proceed via a dimer-vacancy mechanism, where a second N-vacancy is generated to give the second NH3, followed by the dissociative replenishment of the dimer-vacancy for catalyst regeneration.58 This dimer-vacancy healing step is non-electrochemical and cannot be tuned by applying a bias potential. It should be noted that kinetic inhibition of vacancy healing may cause continuous nitrogen leaching from the catalyst surface, finally leading to the breakdown of the lattice structure and catalyst deactivation, which should be a general concern in the design and utilization of metal nitride electrocatalysts.


2.2.3. The scaling relations. 
For any heterogeneous catalysis, the Sabatier principle provides a general picture for searching for optimum catalysts.62,63 The basic idea is that an ideal catalyst should bind atoms and molecules involved in the reaction with an intermediate strength, neither too strongly nor too weakly. If the binding is too weak, the catalyst will be unable to activate the reactants, while if the binding is too strong, the as-formed products cannot be desorbed from the catalyst surface, and the catalyst is poisoned by the intermediates. This results in a volcano-type relationship between catalytic activity and bonding strength.63 This qualitative conceptual illustration can be interpreted quantitively by the modern density-functional theory (DFT) method thanks to the development of computational chemistry. The key point is to quantify the general “bond strength” by a few descriptors to identify the interaction between the catalyst surface and chemical species involved in the reaction. The overall reaction kinetics of a reaction is determined by the activation energy barriers of all the elemental steps, which according to the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relation, are related to the thermodynamics of these reactions, i.e. the adsorption energy of intermediate species on the catalyst surface.64,65 A multiple proton-electron transfer reaction such as nitrogen reduction may involve several different transition states. The adsorption energy of these intermediate species are generally not independent of each other and can be correlated linearly to one or a few descriptors, which are described as the scaling relations.
The scaling relations greatly simplify the search for potential catalysts by allowing an initial screening of adsorption energy instead of performing full DFT calculations each time. In the case of the NRR, all the intermediates are bonded to the catalyst surface by an N atom in a similar manner, and their adsorption energy scales with the *N binding energy. Since the binding energy of *H and *N also scales, the catalytic activities of certain surfaces towards the NRR and its competing HER can be described using a single descriptor of *N binding energy, in the form of activity maps and volcano plots.52 With a well-established linear scaling, new catalysts can be evaluated simply by the N adsorption energy and its corresponding position in the volcano plot. However, the “universal” energetic linearity brings about an intrinsically inevitable problem for catalytic performance optimization. For an ideal catalyst, all the intermediate redox steps should have the same equilibrium potential equal to the overall reaction potential (zero reaction free energy in the case of non-electrochemical steps) to minimize the activation energy barriers, but unfortunately the binding strength of these intermediates cannot be tuned independently from each other, while their difference is far from the optimal values. Van der Ham et al. indicated in their review that a minimum overpotential of 0.4 eV is needed to drive the nitrogen reduction, as estimated from thermodynamic data,9 and the DFT calculation results by Nørskov et al. seem to support this opinion for any transition metal surface, even considering the stabilization by solvation effects.66 To overcome the potential limits, catalysts should either scale differently from transition metals or break the scaling relations completely. Therefore, the rational design of new catalyst structures is highly necessary.

2.3. Criteria for electrochemical NRR catalysts
As the characterization of electrochemical NRR catalysts become standardized, it is necessary to establish a matching set of criteria to evaluate the catalytic performance of a given catalytic system. Importantly, the source of nitrogen for as-formed ammonia should be of particular concern. Considering that generally a trace amount of ammonia is produced during electrolysis for NRR catalyst characterization, the ammonia detected may come from other routes beyond the NRR, such as ammonia contamination in the feeding gas, electrolyte and electrode surface, and decomposition or desorption from the catalyst itself, especially N-containing materials. Thus, the determination of the N source in the NRR has recently been discussed in detail,67 and Wang et al. proposed a standard pattern for conducting controlled NRR experiments, including initial screening of materials and several parallel control experiments including 15N-isotopic labeling experiments to exclude the ammonia contamination or catalyst decomposition issues.27 Only with careful validation of the nitrogen source can we evaluate the NRR performance of given catalysts. In this section, we review several key parameters related to the performance of the NRR, giving a brief summary of their current levels, theoretical expectations and future prospects.

2.3.1. Ammonia formation rate (rNH3). 
Space-time yield (STY) is the key factor of any chemical production facility, considering both efficiency and economic benefits. For electrochemical NRR, the production rate of ammonia per unit time and area/mass is a direct parameter to evaluate the performance of catalysts. Table 1 presents the ammonia production rates of recently reported catalysts, with all the values converted into time and areal/mass (if the specific areal mass loading of the catalyst on the cathode is given) specific mass-based ammonia production rates with the unit of μg (NH3) h−1 cm−2 (or μg h−1 mgcat−1 if possible). Experimentally, this value can be calculated after chronoamperometry measurements using the following equation: (13)where nNH3 is the total amount of ammonia produced during electrolysis, t is the total time of electrolysis, and mcat is the total mass of catalyst. For film catalysts, mcat can be replaced by the area of the electrode (generally geometric area, while surface area and electrochemical specific surface area may also be used). In some reports where metal-containing species are considered as the active phase, especially for noble-metal based catalysts, rNH3 may be presented based on the mass of active metal phase instead of the total mass of catalyst. This calculation method is suitable for the comparison of the intrinsic activities of active sites for the same family of materials, especially for noble-metal-based nanomaterials. However, it is not an ideal universal criterion for generalized catalyst performance evaluation because in practical applications catalysts have to be used in their bulk on account of the total mass or geometric area, and the content of active metal phase may be very low (mostly <10 wt%, even ∼0.1 wt% in some cases), leading to a 10–1000 fold overestimation of catalytic activity. On the other hand, the contribution from the substrate in most cases cannot be simply ignored due to the strong interaction between active particles and supporting materials, which actually acts as a chemical or physical promotor, enhancing the total catalytic performance. Thus, herein, it is strongly recommended that for reports of NRR electrocatalysts, especially noble-metal-based catalysts, the values of normalized ammonia production rates based on both metal content (or active phase content) and total mass should be included for clarity.
The reported rNH3 values mostly fall in the range of 0.1 to 100 μg h−1 cm−2 (or μg h−1 mgcat−1) in aqueous solution and ambient conditions, while that for industrial H–B catalysts are generally in the order of 200–1000 μg h−1 mgcat−1.8 Some of the representative noble-metal-free NRR catalysts recently reported with relatively high efficiency, such as Nb2O5 nanofibers,68 VN,69–71 N-doped porous carbon,72,73 and single-atomic Mo,74 can achieve ammonia yield rates of around 20–100 μg h−1 mgcat−1, which is about an order of magnitude lower than that of the state-of-the-art industrial process, but should be utilized in distributed applications if good selectivity can be achieved, where a low-concentration but continuous supply of ammonia is needed. High-temperature processes such as that reported Licht et al. using molten eutectic electrolytes can reach a level of around 100–500 μg h−1 mgcat−1,37,75 which is comparable to the industrial level, making them appealing alternatives for the H–B process, but the requirement of high temperature and specially designed equipment, and the corrosive reaction conditions hinder their application prospects in POU situations. Thus, further improvement in the ammonia production rates to the level of 500 μg h−1 mgcat−1 may be a short-term purpose for NRR-related research.


2.3.2. Faraday efficiency (FE). 
Faraday efficiency refers to the ratio of faradaic current towards a specific product in the total current. For electrochemical NRR, Faraday efficiency is the measure of NRR selectivity compared with the competing HER.
For the six-electron complete reduction of N2 into NH3, the Faraday efficiency of NH3 can be calculated as follows: (14)where FENH3 is the Faraday efficiency of NH3, 3 is the electron transfer number per NH3 molecule, nNH3 is the total amount of ammonia produced during electrolysis (in the unit of mol), F is the Faraday constant (96485.3 C mol−1), and Q is the total charge consumed during electrolysis (in the unit of C).
For a four-electron nitrogen reduction into hydrazine (N2H4), the Faraday efficiency of N2H4 can be calculated similarly as follows: (15)where FEN2H4 is the Faraday efficiency of N2H4, 4 is the electron transfer number per N2H4 molecule, and nN2H4 is the total amount of hydrazine produced during electrolysis (in the unit of mol).
The total NRR Faraday efficiency is the sum of these two reactions as follows: FENRR (%) = FENH3 + FEN2H4(16)Since very few reports have found the formation of N2H4 during the NRR, we only discuss the ammonia formation pathway here, where the total NRR Faraday efficiency equals the NH3 Faraday efficiency. From Table 1, it can be seen that great progress has been achieved in enhancing the NRR selectivity in the last two years. In studies before 2017, generally catalysts with Faraday efficiency below 1% were reported, which cannot really be called NRR selective in the current perspective. Although some high Faraday efficiency values were reported for high-temperature, high-pressure or nonaqueous systems, nitrogen electrolysis under room temperature, ambient conditions in aqueous solution still mainly produces hydrogen. By careful design and modulation of catalyst composition and morphology as well as system optimization, this number can recently be increased to 10–20%,72–74,76,77 with some particular cases even reaching the level of 30%.78 A short-term goal may be to reach the vicinity of 50%, above which we can say the discovery of a real-mannered NRR catalyst “selective to” instead of “capable of” nitrogen reduction, while the ultimate target can be considered to be around 75%, which is the efficiency upper limit of biological systems.4,9


2.3.3. Selectivity. 
In terms of selectivity, here we refer to the ratio of NH3 in the total nitrogen reduction products with other possible nitrogen reduction byproducts, mainly N2H4, instead of the NRR to HER, as already defined by Faraday efficiency. Hydrazine is an important fine chemical with high added value, which is widely used as a deoxidizer, reducer and feedstock in industry, and high-energy liquid fuel mainly for use in the aerospace industry. However, hydrazine is extremely toxic, and aqueous ammonia solution with even a trace amount of hydrazine cannot be directly used as liquid fertilizer. Accordingly, the NRR selectivity to N2H4 should be zero or 100%. During electrochemical NRR, hydrazine can only be formed by stripping of the *N2H4 intermediate on catalysts following an alternative associative pathway, which is mostly a very endergonic step. Consequently, most catalysts do not intrinsically produce N2H4 because their reaction pathways do not involve the formation of the *N2H4 intermediate, and for those following an alternative pathway, *N2H4 desorption is mostly a kinetically and thermodynamically hindered step, resulting in no N2H4 production. This circumstance is ideal for distributed ammonia production devices by which the as-produced ammonia solution can be directly used without the removal of N2H4, but not good for a possible electrochemical route for cost-efficient and environmental-friendly hydrazine production. To date, N2H4 formation was reported by few studies such as using Au nanorods as the catalyst,79 and the maximum Faraday efficiency towards N2H4 was only 0.163%. More data is needed for this topic, and we expect the discovery of highly NRR-selective catalysts with significant N2H4 yield, which can be possibly used for the electrochemical synthesis of hydrazine.


2.3.4. Stability. 
The stability of catalysts is a major concern for the NRR compared with other electrocatalytic processes such as the ORR, OER and HER. The catalyst surface can be poisoned by coverage with water, oxygen and hydrogen, blocking the active sites for N2 adsorption. This poisoning effect may occur in the initial stage of electrolysis, leading to distinct catalytic behavior with DFT predictions, exhibiting mainly HER or occurring during continuous electrolysis due to the accumulation of in situ electrochemically generated H adatoms, which gradually saturate the catalyst surface. Another common pathway for deactivation is the reduction or degradation of the catalytic active sites, such as in the case of VN, where deactivation is induced by the gradual reduction of surface oxynitrides.69 However, currently, reports focusing on stability are limited. Understanding the catalyst deactivation routes is crucial for the design of stable and highly active NRR catalysts, and thus in situ or operando characterization techniques are highly favored.


2.3.5. Energy efficiency (EE%). 
Energy efficiency, although a not commonly mentioned criterion in the literature, is one of the most crucial factors for practical applications considering both environmental and economic benefits. In the literature, the energy efficiency can be represented by the average energy cost as the energy consumed for the production of one mole of NH3 in the unit of kJ mol−1 or its reciprocal in mol kJ−1, as the energy-specific NH3 yield. The state-of-the-art Haber–Bosch process requires an energy input of ∼485 kJ mol−1.8,39,40 If we consider a combustion-like oxidation reaction as follows: NH3(g) + 3/4O2(g) ⇌ 3/2H2O(l) + 1/2N2(g) ΔcG0m(NH3) = −339.2 kJ mol−1(17)assuming the standard mole reaction Gibbs free energy of this reaction, ΔcG0m(NH3), as the maximum amount of energy we can harvest from one mole of NH3, surprisingly, the H–B process can reach an overall energy efficiency of ∼70% in our scheme. Following this scheme, we can also estimate the energy efficiency of reported NRR electrocatalysts and systems as follows.
The average energy input can be calculated: (18)where ENH3 is the average mole energy input (kJ mol−1), U is the total cell voltage of the electrolyzer (V), Q is the total charge consumed (C), and nNH3 is the total amount of NH3 produced (mol).
From eqn (14) we can get: (19)Thus, herein, we can calculate the energy input E using the reported values of Faraday efficiency and overpotentials. For the nitrogen reduction in an aqueous N2–H2O system, the corresponding anode reaction is the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an equilibrium potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE. Here, we focus on the cathode reaction, and thus we assume an ideal nonpolarizable anodic OER reaction with no overpotential and kinetic limitation. For such an ideal electrolysis cell, the overall cell voltage can be obtained as: U = 1.23 − η(20)where η is the cathode potential vs. RHE (V) at which the NRR is conducted.
Plugging eqn (19) and eqn (20) into eqn (18): (21)The calculated ENH3 can be further used to estimate the energy efficiency for NH3 formation: (22)where EENH3 is the energy efficiency of NH3. Eqn (22) makes it possible to estimate the energy efficiency of reported NRR catalysts from their Faraday efficiency and overpotential. The EENH3 of many reported NRR electrocatalysts in an ambient N2–H2O electrocatalysis system was calculated following the above proposed method and plotted vs. the specific NH3 production rates, as shown in Fig. 5a. Each point represents the performance of an electrocatalyst at its optimized potential. Different categories of materials are plotted in different colors, where the solid icons are calculated from the mass-specific rNH3 data, while hollow icons are based on the area-specific rNH3 data. From Fig. 5a, the comprehensive performance of reported NRR catalysts can be intuitively compared at the same scale. All the reported NRR catalysts to date exhibit an energy efficiency towards NH3 below 13%, and it is generally hard to achieve both high energy efficiency and high ammonia yield rate. Ru- and Pd-based materials can reach high EENH3, but with relatively low yield rates. Furthermore, Au, Mo and some transition metal-based composite materials can achieve relatively high performance in terms of both activity and efficiency; the Fe-based catalysts widely used in the H–B process do not seem to be appealing candidates for the NRR due to both their low EENH3 and rNH3; and carbon-based materials can potentially deliver much high rNH3, but mostly at very negative potentials, leading to their generally low energy efficiency. VN catalysts with different nanomorphologies (nanosheets, nanorods, and nanoparticles) show much different performances, indicating that the exposure of active sites by morphology modulation can play an important role in enhancing the NRR catalytic performance. For electrochemical NRR to be competitive with the commercial H–B ammonia synthesis, catalysts should at least reach a similar level of EENH3 (∼70%) and rNH3 (∼500 μg h−1 mg−1), which is still way above the current level.

Notably, hydrogen is always produced as a co-product during electrochemical NRR, and even the major product in most cases. However, in our above discussion, the energy fixed in the hydrogen produced is not counted, resulting in a largely undervalued total energy efficiency. Considering that the most-efficient biological systems still produce a significant amount of H2 with only around 70–75% electron efficiency for NH3, we have to face the ultimate question, can we ever find an NRR-specific electrocatalyst totally excluding hydrogen evolution? Actually, DTF screening to date still has not found any synthesizable and stable enough materials with an NRR onset potential higher than that for the HER. If hydrogen formation is really an inevitable concomitant process with nitrogen reduction, what we need to do is not try to suppress the HER, but making efforts to maximize the overall performance considering both the NRR and HER. Based on the experience from carbon dioxide electroreduction, where a catalyst with low CO selectivity but high current density can be considered a good candidate for the production of syngas with a tunable composition,80,81 an NRR catalyst with high NH3 yield but low Faraday efficiency may also be considered a good candidate for concurrent NH3/H2 production. Since hydrogen is needed in a future hydrogen-based “green” energy system, and the highly soluble NH3 can be easily separated from H2, the total energy efficiency considering both NH3 and H2 should also be evaluated.
Following our above analysis, we further consider the energy contribution of the HER. Similarly, we use the mole reaction Gibbs free energy of the combustion-like oxidation reaction of hydrogen as the maximum energy harvestable from as-produced H2 as follows: H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) ⇌ H2O(l) ΔcG0m(H2) = −237.1 kJ mol−1(23)Since the Faraday efficiency of H2 production is mostly not given for NRR catalysts and even in most HER-related works, we can only make estimations based on simple assumptions. Here, we assume an ideal 100% total Faraday efficiency, which means that all the current passing through the electrode is faradaic, consumed by either HER or NRR with no other side-reactions, and the contribution from non-faradaic currents is negligible (capacitive charging, dynamic hydrogen chemisorption/absorption on catalyst surface, reduction/hydrogenation/decomposition of catalysts, etc.). In this case, the Faraday efficiency of H2 can be obtained as follows: FEH2 (%) = 100% − FENH3 (%)(24)Also, FEH2 can be calculated directly as: (25)Similar to eqn (19), nH2 can be derived from the Faraday efficiency and total charge: (26)The total energy efficiency can be calculated according to the definition as follows: (27)Combining eqn (19), (26) and (27), EEtotal can be directly calculated from the NRR Faraday efficiency and overpotential as: (28)Based on the series of analysis and derivation, the total energy efficiency of reported NRR catalysts was again plotted against rNH3, as shown in Fig. 5b. It is noticeable that some of the points are above 100% EEtotal because our calculation of the total energy efficiency is based on a series of idealized assumptions including 100% total Faraday efficiency, no side reactions besides the NRR/HER, and ideal OER with no overpotentials, leading to the underestimation of the total energy consumption and overestimation of the HER efficiency. In reality, the best OER catalysts still need an onset potential larger than ∼1.5 V, and non-faradaic currents are always not negligible, especially at low overpotentials with low current density. Still, these estimations can give us a clear image of the overall performance of reported NRR catalysts for concurrent NH3/H2 production. Most catalysts can reach a total energy efficiency of over 50% if hydrogen is considered. Good HER catalysts such as Ru, Pd, and CoP can achieve ∼100% energy efficiency and slow production of NH3 simultaneously and Au-, Mo- and VN-based catalysts can achieve a relatively high total energy efficiency of around 70–90%, while achieving moderately high NH3 yield. However, carbon-based catalysts and other materials with very poor HER cannot efficiently utilize the input electric energy despite their high NH3 production rates. This picture can give us the following inspiration:
(i) The low electron selectivity of NH3 can be compensated by the concurrent production of H2. Catalysts with good HER activity can generally deliver a high total energy efficiency, and as-produced H2/NH3 can be easily separated.
(ii) Catalysts with good NRR selectivity but poor HER performance exhibit a low total energy efficiency; thus, boosting the NRR selectivity by suppressing the HER is not as appealing as enhancing both NRR and HER activities in terms of energy utilization efficiency.
It should be noted that our above discussion is based on the assumption of an aqueous N2–H2O system without any additional coupling anodic reactions, and hence the OER will dominate on the anode. However, in practical applications, the OER is a very low-value-added reaction with very high reaction potentials and sluggish kinetics. Consequently, a high cell voltage above 2.5 V may be needed for an ammonia electrolyzer, while the oxygen produced is of low utilization and may be simply discharged in most cases, leading to waste of more than half of the electricity consumed. Recently, the concept of anodic coupling has attracted increasing attention. Basically the core idea is to replace the energy-inefficient OER reaction with other value-added anodic reactions to achieve the co-production of cathodic and anodic products simultaneously and realize efficient utilization of electricity. The feedstock of these alternative reactions is mostly biomass-derived waste. Candidate reactions include the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), which is a monomer to synthesize bio-based polymers to replace petroleum-based plastics,82 methanol/ethanol oxidation (MOR/EOR) into corresponding acids,83,84 and N-containing species such as urea oxidation (UOR)85 and hydrazine and ammonia itself, as will be discussed in the following parts. Kenis et al. recently proposed a CO2 and glycerol co-electrolysis system, decreasing the electricity consumption by 53%,86 which can be a good reference. In terms of the NRR, given the application scenarios for distributed small-scale continuous ammonia production towards agriculture production, we propose here two possible alternative anodic reactions to replace the OER and increase the overall energy efficiency.
(i) The electricity wasted due to the unwanted HER can be recovered by using the produced H2 in the anodic reaction, changing the reaction configuration from eqn (3) to eqn (1). Since the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) occurs at an equilibrium potential of 0 V vs. RHE instead of the much higher OER potential of 1.23 V, and Pt-based HOR catalysts are commercially mature with much lower overpotentials than OER catalysts, the total cell voltage can decrease by more than 1.2 V, significantly increasing the NH3 energy efficiency.
(ii) Purification of N-rich agriculture downstream wastewater by coupling the NRR with anodic UOR and/or AOR, where both reactions take place at potentials slightly lower than the OER. Downstream of irrigation and animal husbandry has a rich content of urea, which can be further decomposed by urease into ammonia, leading to surface water pollution and eutrophication; however, it cannot be utilized again as nitrogen fertilizers due to impurities and low concentration. The above protocol can digest some of the wastewater produced during agriculture production on-site, saving the cost of wastewater purification and wasting electricity for the OER.
In any case, energy efficiency is a critical parameter to evaluate an electrochemical ammonia synthesis system, which concerns both the cathodic NRR/HER reactions and the anodic OER or other coupling reactions, instead of a single electrode. To improve the total energy efficiency, not only the ammonia produced from nitrogen reduction, but also the hydrogen evolved and the corresponding anodic reaction should be counted and optimized.


2.3.6. Verifying the nitrogen source. 
As a rapidly developing field, electrochemical NRR currently has no standard testing procedures, and thus researchers have proposed several different experimental protocols. Although different electrochemical cells including single-chamber, H-typed double chamber, PEM-type and back-to-back-type cells were comprehensively reviewed by Cui et al.,28 a major issue is to verify the source of nitrogen, excluding labile nitrogen contamination commonly existing in the atmosphere, human breath, experimental equipment and gas feedstock. This issue majorly originates from the generally ultralow ammonia yield and concentration in the product, mostly at the ppb–ppm level, making it critically hard to validate the formation of ammonia from the electrochemical nitrogen reduction process other than contamination. Ammonia from the lab atmosphere and human breathing may induce uncertainty during operation. Trace but nonnegligible amounts of nitrogen-containing compounds exist in the N2 feeding gas, either ammonia directly or volatile nitrogen oxides, which can possibly be reduced at the cathode surface during the reaction into ammonia. Nitrogen from the electrode and catalyst itself, either residuals from the synthesis process or leaching of structural nitrogen, may be one major source of nitrogen contamination, especially for nitrogen-containing catalysts or those produced from nitrogen-containing precursors (such as metal nitrates and organic amines). The ion-conducting membranes such as Nafion used in most studies can also release ammonia during the reaction. According to the form of nitrogen, the N-contamination can be categorized into two types, direct N-contamination in the form of ammonia and indirect N-contamination in the form of nitrate/nitrites or nitrous oxides, which can be further reduced into ammonia by the same catalyst for NRR during electrochemical reduction. Thus, procedures have been proposed to control and exclude the disturbance of nitrogen contamination from the evaluation of NRR catalysts,67,87–89 which will be discussed in detail in this part.
A prerequisite for accurately measuring the ammonia yield and Faraday efficiency is a rigorously designed experimental system, together with strict operating procedures. A gas-tight reaction chamber is obviously the basic requirement to exclude the turbulence of the laboratory atmosphere and human breathing. The switching of gas between Ar and N2 should be valve-controlled to avoid air exposure. The addition of an acid trap prior to the gas inlet is one feasible way to remove ammonia traces in the gas feedstock.
To verify the source of nitrogen and confirm the successful reduction of feeding nitrogen gas into ammonia, at least three types of control experiments must be performed: (i) blank or background controls, (ii) Ar-based electrolysis, and (iii) 15N-isotopic labeling experiments.
For blank or background control tests, the following blank controls should be performed: (i) bubbling gas into blank electrolytes to confirm the ammonia contamination level in the gas feedstock, (ii) bubbling gas with a blank electrode (such as carbon paper) without catalyst at the open-circuit potential (OCP) to exclude N-contamination from the electrode substrate, (iii) electrolysis with a blank electrode without catalyst under an N2 atmosphere at the reaction potential to determine the contribution of the NRR performance from the electrode substrates, and (iv) blank controls at the OCP with the working electrodes to exclude ammonia release from residual N from the preparation of the catalyst and verify the stability of N-containing catalysts. By performing blank contrast experiments, direct ammonia contamination from the reaction system and working electrodes can be readily excluded or at least their level can be determined.
An Ar-based control experiment is a firm approach to exclude most of the fake positive signals. Similar to blank controls, firstly the ammonia level in Ar feedstock has to be determined, and then Ar-based electrolysis with the catalyst under working potential ranges should be performed. Ar-controls can exclude the potential-induced desorption of surface N-residue and electrochemical decomposition of N-containing catalysts, as well as electrochemical reduced indirect ammonia contaminations. In most cases, if the ammonia yield under N2-electrolysis significantly surpasses that under Ar, the catalyst tested can be believed to have at least certain NRR activity. Greenlee et al. in their viewpoint, gave detailed instructions for conducting rigorous Ar-control NRR experiments and calculating NRR selectivity and yield rate accordingly.67 Zhang's work is another good example of well-controlled experiments, where the ammonia contribution from nitrogen gas, carbon paper, catalysts, Nafion, ambient environment in the lab, and Ar-based electrolysis was conclusively evaluated.90 In their final calculation, contaminant NH3 contributed to at most ∼1.5% of the total ammonia yield, which was at the same level with experimental error.
One ultimate solution to the nitrogen source issues is isotopic 15N-labelling experiments. 15N-Qualification and quantification are currently the most reliable experimental protocol for NRR measurements. Combined with 1H NMR measurements, the formation of 15N-ammonia can be clearly confirmed by the doublet peaks of 15NH3 compared to the triplet peaks of 14NH3. By adding suitable internal standards, the amount of 15NH3 and ratios between 15N/14N-ammonia can be readily quantified. Although NMR quantification has similar detection sensitivity and accuracy compared with other ammonia quantification methods, such as UV-Vis absorption and ammonia-selective electrode,37,91 its combination with purified 15N2 feeding gas can guarantee the source of ammonia formed to the greatest extent. However, this protocol has several severe limitations, mainly from the scarcity and high cost of 15N2 gas, together with the inevitable contamination in commercial 15N-feedstock, which severely limit its utilization. On the other hand, even when using 15N2, careful treatment of the gas is indispensable considering the relatively lower purity of 15N2 gas (mostly below 99.9%) than common 14N2 gas (≥99.999%). Richard et al. analyzed 15N2 feedstock from three major suppliers, revealing the existence of several 15N-enriched impurities, including 15N-ammonia, 15N-nitrite/nitrate and 15N-nitrous oxides.92 Considering that most of these contaminants are soluble in water, the commercial 15N2 gas can be readily purified by passing through absorption bottles filled with aqueous solution. Jiang et al. in their recent work applied three absorption bottles in tandem, filled with alkaline, acid and Na2SO4 electrolyte, respectively, to pre-purify 15N2 gas and use it for isotopic quantification by NMR.93 Chorkendorff et al. recently proposed a rigorous quantitative isotopic protocol consisting of pre-purification of 15N2 gas by a reduced-Cu catalyst, gas circulation to reduce isotope consumption and contamination, and finally quantification by 1H NMR measurements.87 However, this protocol needs considerable time to be generalized to the research community due to the complexity of the reaction system.
Specifically, special care has to be taken for catalyst materials concerning metal-nitrides. Although DFT calculations and some early works suggested that TMNs may be ideal candidates for electrochemical NRR with the special MvK mechanism, the stability and source of nitrogen later proved to be a critical issue. Isotopic experiments are particularly necessary for research related with metal nitrides. Hu et al. recently performed a strict isotope-labeling experiment on the well-known Mo2N catalysts, and surprisingly found that no 15NH4+ was formed after electrolysis, implying no catalytic ability but chemical decomposition of the nitride catalyst.94 Still, it should be noted that even without an isotopic-labeling experiment, reliable results can be acquired with careful control of the experimental environment and delicately designed controlled experiments, such as that reported by Du et al. for VN and NbNx systems.95

2.4. Electrocatalysts for the NRR
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrogen is a complicated system involving gas–liquid–solid three-phase interfaces, where gas diffusion, mass/electron transportation, number or density and intrinsic activity of catalyst active sites all play crucial roles in the overall performance. Although several technological parameters including electrolyte, reactor configuration, temperature, pressure, and potential (or current), should be considered for the optimization of a practical NRR electrolyzer, the design of the electrocatalyst itself is still the most essential factor. Since the early efforts dating back to 1969,35 very limited works have been reported in the field of N2 electroreduction with various catalyst materials and system design, probably due to the disappointing sluggish reaction kinetics, low Faraday efficiencies acquired (mostly below 1%) and resultant huge energy consumption compared with industrial and biological systems.96–98 However, the landscape changed in 2016, where prominent progress in nanomaterials, electrochemistry and characterization techniques have boosted the significant improvement of electrochemical nitrogen reduction at low temperature and in aqueous media, in terms of Faraday efficiency and ammonia formation yields. Although the mapping of suitable catalysts is far from complete, a series of recent reports have established a partly systematic picture with several possible strategies to guide future catalyst design.
The earliest report of electrochemical ammonia synthesis is the molecular titanium–aluminum system reported by van Tamelen and Seeley in 1969,3 where nitrogen reduction was conducted in a glyme solution of titanium and aluminum isopropoxides, with nichrome and aluminum as the cathode and anode, respectively. The Ti(II) species electrochemically generated served as an enzyme-like active center to fix and reduce dinitrogen by forming nitrogen adducts, which were freed by the aluminum in the electrolyte as NH3. A cell voltage of 40 V was applied over 11 days, producing 10.2 mmol of NH3, corresponding to a Faraday efficiency of 19.7%. Despite the high cell voltage and slow kinetics, the aluminum anode took part in the nitrogen reduction and was continuously consumed during the reaction, limiting the potential of this system for large-scale production. In 1983, Sclafani et al. developed the first modern-type heterogeneous NRR system using iron as the cathode in aqueous solution under ambient pressure and low temperature.96 Subsequently, in 1989, Furuya and Yoshiba reported a gas-diffusion electrode modified by Fe-phthalocyanine in various electrolytes, with Pt as the anode.97 This system reached an initial NH3 current efficiency of ∼1.6% at −0.6 V vs. RHE, but it quickly dropped below 0.1% after 10 min of electrolysis. They further investigated a range of inorganic materials towards electrochemical NRR by loading the fine powders of these materials onto gas-diffusion electrodes, but of the catalysts tested exhibited obvious activity and selectivity.98 Since the turn of the century, some systematic works were reported to construct a full picture of NRR catalysts. Various catalysts including noble metal and non-noble transition metal, inorganic compounds, single-atom catalysts, carbon-based metal-free materials, conductive polymers and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) were applied to electrochemical nitrogen reduction. By modulation of composition as well as morphology, crystallinity, crystal facets, vacancy and hydrophobicity, the NRR activities in terms of Faraday efficiency (FE) and ammonia production rate impressively increased by an order of magnitude higher than a decade before. Table 1 summarizes some representative experimental reports for electrochemical nitrogen reduction into ammonia by heterogeneous catalysts, with all the reported ammonia formation rates normalized to the same scale (mass activity with the unit of μg NH3 h−1 mgcat−1 based on total mass or areal activity with the unit of μg NH3 h−1 cmgeo−2 for thin films or membranes based on geometric area) if possible.

2.4.1. Metal-based materials for the NRR. 
Theoretical calculations. 
Thermocatalytic ammonia synthesis on pure metal surfaces is a well-understood process, where generally a dissociative pathway dominates due to the high energy barrier of the addition of the first hydrogen. For the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, which is the case for photocatalytic, electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic NRR, mostly an associative pathway is preferred. A pure metal surface is the most classic model for theoretical calculations. The series of DFT calculations by Skúlason, Nørskov and collaborators52,66 provided an approximate overview of the NRR on metal surfaces. In the representative early work in 2012,52 they simulated the reduction of N2 admolecules and N adatoms on flat or stepped transition metal surfaces in acidic electrolyte, giving a calculated free energy profile to help predict the catalytic performance. The calculations indicated that the binding energy of the intermediates (NHx and N2Hx) scales quite well with the binding energy of N, especially including the H adsorption energy, making it possible to consider the NRR together with the HER in the same scale using a single descriptor of N binding energy (Fig. 6a). A combined volcano plot was established for both flat and stepped transition metal surfaces to explicate the relation between N binding energy and electrochemical NRR limiting potential, as shown in Fig. 6b. On top of the volcano plot is Fe, Mo, Ru and Rh as the most active metals towards the NRR; however, these surfaces, together with most of the other metals investigated, are likely saturated by H adatoms instead of N, resulting in pronounced competing hydrogen generation, reducing the NRR Faraday efficiency and ammonia production rates. Early transition metals including Sc, Y, Ti, and Zr bind N adatoms more strongly than H adatoms, and the NRR on these surfaces is expected to dominate over the HER; however, with a large applied potential bias of −1.0 V to −1.5 V vs. SHE. Additionally, these surfaces are likely poisoned by oxygen in contact with water. They later investigated the linear scaling between the energetics of two key intermediates, *N2H and *NH2, for an associative process, which was related to the reductive adsorption of N2 or reductive desorption of NHx, i.e. the first and last electrochemical steps in the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia.66 Considering the different crystalline structures and facets, two-dimensional volcano diagrams (activity maps) of NRR limiting potentials were plotted as a function of the energetic barriers of the potential-limiting steps using the energy descriptors of ΔG(*N2H) and (ΔG(*NH2) − ΔG(*NH)) for the fcc(111) surfaces or ΔG(*N2H) and (ΔG(NH3(g)) − ΔG(*NH2)) the for fcc(211) and bcc(110) surfaces (Fig. 6c and d), respectively. Unfortunately, due to the limitation of the linear scaling between these descriptors, all the transition metals and their alloys fell on the linear lines, which do not intersect with the mountain top on the activity maps corresponding to the optimal potential regions, indicating an inherent theoretical overpotential of at least ∼0.5 V for NRR onset. These results give guidance for further optimization, where a new candidate catalyst should either scale differently with transition metals or entirely break the scaling relations by independently tuning the adsorption strength of intermediates. Optimized limiting potentials can be achieved by selectively stabilizing *N2H or destabilizing *NH2, possibly by rationally designed steric active sites and addition of suitable co-adsorbates, promoters or electrolytes. However, alloying will not be an effective approach because alloys will also fall on the same linear lines as transition metals on the activity maps unless the intermediates can bond differently on the active sites.

Nanolization is another common strategy to enhance the catalytic performance. Vegge et al. investigated the catalytic activity of transition metal nanoclusters in acidic electrolyte by DFT calculation using a metal cluster containing 12 atoms in two close-packed layers as a model for a highly under-coordinated and ultra-small nanoparticle.99 The highly under-coordinated sites were found to promote the electrochemical nitrogen reduction into ammonia with an onset potential of around −0.6 V to −0.5 V vs. SHE following the associative mechanism. As shown in Fig. 6e, the most promising candidate is Mo, followed by Fe and Nb then Ru, and their alloys may reach the top of the volcano plot, corresponding to an NRR onset potential of −0.45 V. However, the onset potential of competing HER is still lower than that for the NRR even for the most optimized case, indicating the dominating hydrogen evolution over ammonia formation. Moreover, the stability of such small nanoclusters in water is a questionable topic. The most promising Mo nanoclusters are found to bind oxygen preferably over nitrogen and hydrogen at neutral bias in aqueous solution, blocking the active sites for both the NRR and HER, and a large negative potential of −0.72 V is needed to reduce the adsorbed oxygen adatoms and get a clear surface for dinitrogen molecules to attach.100
Single-atom catalysts (SAC) are the ultimate form of nanoparticles, where all the atoms are surface active sites. A series of DFT calculations have recently predicted the potential of transition metal single atomic sites supported on various substrates towards electrochemical NRR, typically, nitrogen-doped graphene,51,101,102 defective boron nitride103 and MoS2 nanosheets.104 In a detailed study by Jung et al.,101 metal single atomic sites embedded on defected graphene with or without nitrogen doping were evaluated as electrochemical NRR catalysts, and four models were examined, including M@C3, M@C4, M@N3, and M@N4. Among the materials investigated, several stable and NRR-active SACs were discovered, where Ti@N4 and V@N4 were determined to be the most promising and synthesizable potential NRR catalysts with low onset potential and high selectivity. Interestingly, the origin of the improved NRR performance of SACs compared with metal surfaces was also revealed. On bulk metal surfaces, several adsorption sites concurrently exist including top, bridging and hollow sites, whereas on SACs only the top sites are available. Hydrogen and *NH2 adsorption on the atop sites of SACs were highly unstable due to the lack of atomic assemblies and electronic effect from positively charged metal centers, which were coulombically repulsive to protons, while the electroneutral N2 was not affected much (Fig. 6f). The metal–support interaction resulted in positively charged metal centers with shifted d-orbitals, making them easier to bind N2 by favorable back-bonding. Nevertheless, the HER is the dominating reaction on SACs at operative negative potentials even with hydrogen adsorption suppression, but with an improved selectivity for the NRR compared with the corresponding bulk metals. Similar to SACs, ultra-small metal nanoclusters where all atoms are on the surface can also achieve 100% active site utilization, such as double- or triple-atomic clusters, and this concept has recently been implemented in several catalysis research fields, but their application in the field of NRR still needs further investigation.
Despite the discouraging theoretical predictions, many efforts have been devoted from both experimental and calculation sides for new strategies to design metal-based NRR electrocatalysts, trying to bypass the scaling relations and enhance the catalytic activity. Noble metals, especially Pt, Ru, Au, Rh, Pd, and their nanostructures, have attracted significant interests. On the other hand, currently reported DFT calculations may not be precise or extensive enough for experimental results. For example, Au as one of the most studied NRR electrocatalysts is located far from the top of volcano plots, and experimental trials for metal nitrides/oxides mostly resulted in Faraday efficiencies far below that predicted. This gap between theoretical predictions and experimental works possibly originates from the complicated electrode surface environment in real testing conditions, where interactions from solvents molecules, electrolyte ions, gas bubbles and electrode substrates/binders play indispensable roles during the reaction. Additionally, the idealized perfect single-crystalline models used in most DFT calculations deviate from the defect-rich, polycrystalline nature of nanocatalysts used in most experimental works. Thus, influence from the above factors may need to be considered in further theoretical studies, but will increase the burden for calculation due to the steeply increased system complexity.
Ruthenium. 
Ruthenium is the best catalyst for ammonia synthesis in the Haber–Bosch process,39,40 and thus the first to be tested for electrochemical NRR. In 2000, Kordali et al. reported the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and water at atmospheric pressure and low temperature (below 100 °C) using an Ru cathode in a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) cell.105 Carbon felt was electrochemically deposited with Ru as the cathode, and a Nafion membrane was used as a proton-conductive solid electrolyte, combined with 2 M KOH as the aqueous electrolyte in the anode chamber. The reaction took place at the gas–solid interface between the Ru surface and nitrogen steam, and the ammonia produced was collected with a boric acid solution trap. Ammonia was found to be the only reduction product, and the electrode remained stable during 100 h of electrolysis with a constant ammonia formation rate. Nitrogen reduction started at −0.96 V vs. saturated Ag/AgCl electrode at 90 °C with a maximum Faraday efficiency of 0.92%, and reached a maximum ammonia formation rate of 1.30 μg h−1 cm−2 at −1.02 V, after which the ammonia formation rate decreased due to pronounced hydrogen discharge. Since no hydrazine was detected in their experiments, they suggested that nitrogen reduction proceeded via a dissociative mechanism. In a recent study, Ru nanoparticles (Ru NPs) were directly grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP) and used as binder-free electrodes for the NRR in 0.01 M HCl electrolyte with much-improved performance.106 Ammonia formation was initiated at 0.05 V vs. RHE, while the peak Faraday efficiency of ∼5.4% was observed at 0.01 V vs. RHE with an ammonia formation rate of ∼2 mg h−1 m−2. The highest yield rate of ∼5.5 mg h−1 m−2 appeared at −0.1 V vs. RHE at 20 °C, which increased to a maximum of 21.4 mg h−1 m−2 at 60 °C. At further elevated temperature, ammonia production was retarded due to the decrease in N2 solubility in water. Their DFT calculations also supported a dissociation pathway initiated by the side-on adsorption of N2 on the edge sites of the Ru NPs.
In contrast, recent DFT calculations seem to indicate that electrochemical NRR at the Ru surface can be a more complicated process than expected.52,107 The lowest potential required for all electrochemical steps to be exergonic is −1.08 V on a flat Ru(0001) surface and −0.43 V on a stepped surface following an associative mechanism, where a distal pathway is preferred for both cases instead of an alternative pathway. The first hydrogenation step is the potential-determining step for a flat surface, while a stepped surface can stabilize the *N2H intermediate more strongly by bonding both nitrogen atoms with the terrace, and thus substantially decrease the required bias potentials. Comparatively, a dissociative pathway requires only −0.16 V externally applied potential; however, the rate-determining step is the cleavage of NN bonds, which is a non-electrochemical process with a large activation energy and can only be thermally promoted by the elevating reaction temperature. Seoin Back and Yousung Jung indicated that the kinetic barriers of N–N bond cleavage decrease substantially as more hydrogens are added to the reduced intermediate species,107 and N–N dissociation can possibly happen during any stage of an associative process, leading to several mixed dissociative-associative pathways with similar limiting potentials (−0.71 V) compared to the associative pathway (−0.68 V). Their results also demonstrate that hydrogen evolution is the major obstacle for the NRR, and that H-coverage can dramatically hinder the first protonation step, leading to increased overpotentials and change in the rate-determining steps.
Recently, Sun et al. reported the application of Ru single-atom catalysts for electrochemical NRR in 0.1 M HCl electrolyte at room temperature (Fig. 7).108 Composites with single Ru sites encapsulated in a nitrogen-doped porous carbon matrix with ZrO2 nanoparticles (Ru@ZrO2/NC) were prepared from an Ru-loaded Zr-based metal–organic framework (MOF) with amino-containing ligands, UiO-66-NH2, via a thermal pyrolysis method, and the ZrO2 particles were further washed off by HF leaching to give Ru/NC. Ru/NC gave the highest ammonia yield of 3.665 mg h−1 mgRu−1 at −0.21 V vs. RHE (corresponding to a total mass activity of ∼4.6 μg h−1 mg−1), while contrast experiments using commercial Ru/C or NaBH4 reduced Ru on few-layered graphene resulted in nearly zero NRR Faraday efficiency with vigorous HER (Fig. 7b and c), probably due to their larger Ru particle sizes (>3 nm). Their results indicate that only by reducing the size of Ru to the atomic-level can the HER be effectively suppressed. The nitrogen doping in the carbon support played an important role of stabilizing and dispersing Ru single atomic sites by coordination bonds, and the presence of ZrO2 significantly suppressed the HER, contributing to the higher Faraday efficiency of Ru@ZrO2/NC comparing to Ru/NC over the whole potential range tested, especially in the low overpotential region, with the highest value of 21% at −0.11 V. Subsequent DFT calculations indicated that the Ru atom tended to anchor on the surface O-vacancies of ZrO2, which possibly originated from the thermal treatment. Ru single-atomic sites embedded on either ZrO2 or N-doped carbon both showed improved NRR activity compared to the Ru(0001) surface (Fig. 7d), with reduced free-energy change at potential-determining steps (PDS). The Ru–ZrO2 surface especially preferred the adsorption of N2 over H in the initial stage, contributing to the improved NRR selectivity over the HER. Further research of Ru-based NRR electrocatalysts should concentrate on how to avoid the HER-active Ru particles and increase the density of Ru single atomic sites with good dispersion.

Rhodium. 
Rhodium is located nearer than Ru to the mountaintop on the NRR volcano plot,52 and thus should be considered as a greater potential candidate for the NRR. Kugler and coworkers investigated the possibility of using Rh and Ru as NRR electrocatalysts by galvanic coating of Rh and Ru onto randomly structured Ti felts in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte.109 Linear sweep voltammetry tests showed that contrary to the DFT prediction, Ru exhibited an ammonia yield rate (1.2 × 10−10 mol s−1 cm−2) about eight times higher than that of Rh (1.5 × 10−11 mol s−1 cm−2), although detailed chronoamperometric tests were not performed. Recently, ultrathin two-dimensional Rh nanosheet nanoassemblies (Rh NNs) with atomic-level thickness (ca. 1 nm) were synthesized via a surfactant-free approach from an inorganic polymer RhCl3–K3Co(CN)6 cyanogel precursor.110 The Rh NNs were tested for the NRR in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. An impressively high ammonia formation rate of 23.88 μg h−1 mgcat−1 was observed at a low potential of −0.2 V vs. RHE for Rh NNs with good selectivity (no hydrazine detected), much higher than that of Rh nanoparticles (11.45 μg h−1 mgcat−1). However, the authors discovered that the Rh NNs were also an excellent HER catalyst, even better than home-made Pt nanoparticles, and hence the Faraday efficiency towards the NRR at −0.2 V was only 0.217% due to vigorous hydrogen generation. Therefore, they proposed that since no other by-products were produced and that NH3 can be easily separated from H2, the Rh NNs can be applied for the highly efficient simultaneous production of ammonia and hydrogen.
Gold. 
Au-Based catalysts have recently shown potential as the most promising noble-metal NRR electrocatalysts. By applying the surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy technique, the NRR process on an Au thin film electrode in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte was revealed.55 At an NRR potential range below 0 V vs. RHE, absorption bands corresponding to the adsorbed N2Hy intermediates were observed, firmly indicating an alternative associative pathway, while similar signals were not detected on a Pt surface due to the much faster HER kinetics, in accordance with the much lower NRR efficiency. The pure Au electrode showed only limited NRR activity (NH3 yield: 3.84 × 10−12 mol cm−2 s−1 and Faraday efficiency: 0.12% at −0.5 V vs. RHE),55 and theoretical calculations also implied the disfavored nitrogen binding energy.52 Modulation of crystalline facets, crystallinity, electronic structures and nanomorphology can readily improve the performance of Au nanospecies, while the poor HER activity of gold instead benefits a relatively high Faraday efficiency towards the electrochemical NRR.
Tuning the morphology of nanomaterials is a common approach to modify their performance. Tetrahexahedral Au nanorods (THH Au NRs) were first discovered to catalyze the electrochemical NRR with relatively high efficiency at room temperature and ambient pressure in 0.1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte.79 The NRR started as early as 0.05 V vs. RHE with a Faraday efficiency of 0.14%, and the maximum performance was achieved at −0.2 V with a formation rate of 1.648 μg h−1 cm−2 for NH3 and 0.102 μg h−1 cm−2 for N2H4, and a total NRR Faraday efficiency of ∼4.0%. At more negative potentials, the HER became obvious and suppressed the NRR performance (Fig. 8a). The NRR rate was found to be independent of the N2 flowing rate, possibly due to the limited nitrogen solubility in aqueous solution, and nitrogen diffusion did not seem to be the rate-determining step. The NRR rate increased exponentially with elevated temperature, in good accordance with the Arrhenius law, and the reaction rate was about 2.1 times higher at 65 °C than at 5 °C, with a calculated activation energy of 13.704 kJ mol−1. The definite NRR activity was attributed to the highly under-coordinated surface of THH Au NRs enclosed by high-index multistep 730 facets composed of (210) and (310) sub-facets, which provided rich active sites for nitrogen adsorption and dissociation (Fig. 8b). Importantly, it should be noted that this is currently the only report that hydrazine byproduct was detected. Since hydrazine was produced, the reaction mechanism was confirmed to follow an alternative association pathway, and DFT calculations implied that on both (210) and (310) facets, the addition of the first hydrogen on adsorbed N2 admolecule was the rate-determining step, while all the following steps were exothermic except hydrazine desorption. Hollow nanostructures are known to facilitate the catalytic performance compared with their solid counterparts due to the large active surface area from both their inner and outer surfaces, confinement effect of reactants inside the cage (cage effect), and possibly less capping by surfactants for the inner side.111–115 Au hollow nanocages (Au HNCs) with well-defined shape, porous shells, rich active facets and average edge length of 35 nm (Fig. 8c) were synthesized by galvanic replacement from Ag solid nanocube templates and loaded onto indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates for NRR electrocatalysis.78 Compared with other solid Au nanocatalysts including Au nanocubes, Au nanospheres, and Au nanorods, the Au HNCs showed much enhanced NRR activity in 0.5 M LiClO4 electrolyte at 20 °C and ambient temperature, with the highest ammonia yield rate of 3.9 μg h−1 cm−2 at −0.5 V vs. RHE, and highest Faraday efficiency of 30.2% at −0.4 V vs. RHE, about three-fold compared to that of 11.4% for Au nanocubes. At the elevated temperature of 50 °C, the Faraday efficiency could be further increased to 40.5%, which is among the highest values reported to date. However, since nitrate precursors were used, further study may be needed to verify and determine the source of nitrogen and accurately calculate the Faraday efficiency, such as isotopic quantification.87

Exposure of defect-rich and highly unsaturated surfaces is a promising strategy to facilitate nitrogen reduction on the Au surface, and decreasing the size of particles is the most efficient method to increase the ratio of high-energy surface atoms. Au sub-nanoclusters of ∼0.5 nm were dispersed and imbedded on commercial P25 TiO2 surfaces via a moderate tannic-acid reduction method at room temperature.116 When applied for electrochemical NRR in 0.1 M HCl solution, the Au/TiO2 catalyst exhibited surprisingly high activity with an ammonia production rate of 21.4 μg h−1 cm−2 and Faraday efficiency of 8.11% at −0.2 V vs. RHE. To verify the size effect, NaBH4-reduced (∼4 nm) and photo-reduced (∼37 nm) Au/TiO2 were also prepared and tested for the NRR, showing a decreased performance with increased particle size (Fig. 8d). The high performance was attributed to the partial positively charged Au centers via Au–O–Ti bonding, which preferred the adsorption of electro-neutral dinitrogen molecules besides the positively-charged H+. Both the NH3 yield and Faraday efficiency increased at elevated temperatures with a very small activation energy of 5.9 kJ mol−1, indicating the mass transfer of reactant is a crucial factor. Wang et al. used a hierarchically structured nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon membrane (NCM) as a semiconductive porous substrate to load Au nanoparticles, achieving a high NH3 yield rate of 0.36 g m−2 h−1 at −0.2 V vs. RHE and Faraday efficiency of 22% at −0.1 V.117 The metallic Au nanoparticles and semiconductive NCM interface formed a heterojunction, creating a rectified electron transfer from NCM to Au, where the positively charged NCM surface could more easily bind N2 molecules, thus improving the NRR activity. We will specifically discuss this type of strategy with the Mott–Schottky-type catalyst configuration in a later section.
Following the same path of decreasing particle size, the ultimate form of a surface-rich particle is atomically-dispersed metal sites, where 100% atom utilization is achieved. Polymeric carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was used as a support to load atomically-dispersed Au sites (Au1/C3N4) or Au nanoparticles (Au NPs/C3N4).118 According to EXAFS and XANES results, the Au atoms were coordinated with the N in g-C3N4 with a coordination number of around 3 and were positively charged with a valence state around +1, while the absence of an Au–Au bond signal confirmed the atomic dispersion of Au sites. When applied for electrochemical NRR in 5 mmol H2SO4 electrolyte, Au1/C3N4 presented an NH4+ formation rate of 1305 μg h−1 mgAu−1 with a Faraday efficiency of 11.1% at −0.1 V vs. RHE, about 22.5 times that of Au NPs/C3N4 (58.39 μg h−1 mgAu−1). However, it should be specifically noted that although the atomic Au sites showed significantly higher intrinsic activity towards Au nanoparticles and some other Au-based materials, the Au content in Au1/C3N4 was extremely low (0.15%), much lower than that of Au NPs/C3N4 (3.4%), leading to a slightly lower overall activity instead (1.961 μg h−1 mgcat−1 for Au1/C3N4 and 1.985 μg h−1 mgcat−1 for Au NPs/C3N4) based on the total weight of the catalyst composites. The ultra-low density of atomic metal sites in supporting materials is a major issue for future single-atomic catalyst research.
Modulation of the crystallinity can also intentionally create amorphous metal materials in a metastable state, with different atomic arrangements and rich surface under-coordinated dangling bonds. Amorphous Au nanoparticles of ∼5 nm anchored on reduced graphite oxides (rGO) with the amorphization induced by CeOx (a-Au/CeOx–rGO) were synthesized via a coreduction method at room temperature.119 Low-crystalline cerium oxides (CeOx) were found to play a crucial role in the formation of amorphous Au species, where polycrystalline cubic Au particles were acquired without the presence of CeOx, and rGO was introduced as a conductive substrate to homogeneously disperse the Au and CeOx nanospecies. The as-acquired a-Au/CeOx–rGO with a low Au loading of 1.31 wt% exhibited a high NRR performance with an ammonia formation rate of 8.3 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and Faraday efficiency of 10.10% at −0.2 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M HCl electrolyte at room temperature, much higher than that of its crystalline counterpart without CeOx (c-Au/rGO, with a Faraday efficiency of 3.67% and ammonia yield of 3.5 μg h−1 mgcat−1) (Fig. 9). These results can inspire further research on amorphous metal nanocatalysts towards NRR. However, it should be noted that since N-containing precursors were used, the source of nitrogen in this work may need further determination by more accurate experimental methods such as 15N-quantitative measurements.87

Palladium. 
Palladium is another noble metal with potential as an NRR electrocatalyst. The landmark work by George Marnellos and Michael Stoukides in 199836 utilized a pair of Pd electrodes separated by proton-conductive strontia-ceria-ytterbia (SCY) perovskite solid-state electrolyte using elemental nitrogen and hydrogen as feedstock, and for the first time achieved continuous electrochemical ammonia synthesis at 570 °C and ambient pressure, with more than 78% conversion based on hydrogen. From DFT calculation, Pd is located closer to the top than Au on the NRR volcano plot, near Pt, and thus should be a pronounced HER catalyst. Nevertheless, Pd nanoparticles supported on carbon black have recently been shown to exhibit high NRR performance in neutral electrolyte.120 Utilization of neutral 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) significantly suppressed the HER compared with acidic H2SO4 or basic NaOH electrolytes due to the higher kinetic barrier of mass and charge transportation (Fig. 10), and the NRR was initiated at a low overpotential of 0.1 V vs. RHE with a Faraday efficiency of 8.2% and ammonia yield of 4.5 μg h−1 mgPd−1, about 200–300 mV higher than that of Au-based catalysts. Applying a more negative potential did not obviously increase the NRR rate, but led to a dramatic drop in FE due to the increase in the HER, and an activity loss of 50% was observed after 15 h operation due to the aggregation of the Pd nanoparticles, and thus loss of active Pd surfaces. The NRR activity of Pd/C was an order of magnitude higher than that of Au/C and Pt/C under the same condition of −0.05 V, where both Au/C and Pt/C produced NH3 at a similar rate of 0.3 μg h−1 mgmetal−1, but Au/C showed a much higher Faraday efficiency of 1.2% compared to the 0.2% of Pt/C. The high NRR activity of Pd/C was attributed to the in situ formation of a Pd hydride phase under the operation potentials, which facilitated the first hydrogenation step of N2 by a Grotthuss-like proton hopping mechanism (Fig. 10), while the HER was hindered by H-desorption. The reaction rate-determining step was the surface chemical hydrogenation instead of the proton-coupled electron transfer, which explained the weak correlation between the potential and ammonia yield in the low overpotential range. Further studies are needed for increasing the activity and stability of Pd-based NRR electrocatalysts.

Other noble metals. 
Other noble metals such as Pt and Ir were also investigated for NRR, but with limited performance.121–124 Nash et al. compared the performance of five commercial noble metal-carbon catalysts (Pt/C, Ir/C, Au/C, Ru/C, Pd/C, and 20% metal on Vulcan XC-72) towards the NRR in both proton exchange membrane (PEM) and hydroxide exchange membrane (HEM) electrolyzers (PEMELs and HEMELs, respectively).123 In both cases, the HER was the dominant reaction for all five metals tested, while in the HEMELs the Faraday efficiencies were generally higher than that in the PEMELs due to the more sluggish HER kinetics; however, at the cost of the ammonia yield rate, which was about an order of magnitude lower. In the PEMELs, all five catalysts showed similar NH3 formation rates, while Ru/C and Au/C showed higher Faraday efficiencies. In the HEMELs, Au/C showed the highest Faraday efficiency of 0.55%, about an order of magnitude higher than that of the other four metals and the PEMELs. Ir/C exhibited the highest ammonia formation rates in both the PEMELs and HEMELs; however, with a rather poor Faraday efficiency, especially in the HEMELs. On the other hand, Pt is the state-of-the-art HER catalyst, and thus herein will not be considered a good candidate for electrochemical NRR. Consequently, there are limited reports trying to use Pt and Ir as cathode catalysts for the NRR. Tao and coworkers tested the commercial Pt/C in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configuration with a mixed NH4+/H+ pre-exchanged Nafion membrane in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte.121 At a cell voltage of 1.6 V, a maximum ammonia production rate of 1.14 × 10−5 mol m−2 s−1 was achieved, with a Faraday efficiency of ∼0.52%. They later modified the experimental setup with a mixed Li+/NH4+/H+ Nafion membrane using 0.1 M Li2SO4 electrolyte instead, and an improved Faraday efficiency of 0.83% was acquired at 80 °C, with an ammonia production rate of 9.37 × 10−6 mol m−2 s−1.122 In a recent work by Botte et al.,124 a strong alkaline polymer-based gel electrolyte prepared from polyacrylic acid and 6 M KOH was developed and implemented in a PEM-type electrochemical cell with Pt/C- or Ir/C-loaded gas-diffusion electrodes as the cathodes for the NRR; however, from N2 and H2 instead of water. The best performance of Pt/C was acquired at 30 °C with a cell voltage of 0.5 V, reaching an ammonia yield of 4.049 × 10−11 mol cm−2 s−1 and Faraday efficiency of 0.0106%, while for Ir/C, the optimized condition was 60 °C and 0.25 V cell voltage, with an ammonia yield of 2.763 × 10−11 mol cm−2 s−1 and Faraday efficiency of 0.108%. The focus of this work was not the catalyst itself, but instead the development of a new polymer gel electrolyte to help control the HER rate by limiting water transportation considering that the acidic Nafion membrane will react with the produced ammonia as a weak base, leading to reduced proton conductivity. Nevertheless, the Faraday efficiencies reported were well below that reported for other noble metals. Thus, the further study of Pt and Ir towards the NRR is bleak since they are better suited for hydrogen catalysis.
Molybdenum. 
Compared with noble metals, reports of non-noble transition metals directly as NRR catalysts are rather limited. Potential candidates are Mo, Fe and W according to DFT calculations.52 Although in early research, Nishibayashi et al. reported the successful nitrogen fixation by a W-based dinitrogen complex molecular catalyst with the assistance of an Ru-complex,125,126 no report of metallic W or its compounds/complex in the field of electrochemical NRR has been published to date, and only one study was discovered using a metallic Mo-based electrocatalyst.127 Mo is predicted to be the most potential metal for the NRR with the lowest onset potential, but the HER would still be the major reaction. NRR on commercial Mo foil was found to start at −0.39 V vs. RHE in 0.01 M H2SO4 electrolyte, corresponding well with theoretical calculation, and reached the maximum performance at −0.59 V with an ammonia formation rate of 1.87 × 10−11 mol s−1 cm−2 and Faraday efficiency of 0.13%. The Mo foils were further treated by electrochemical deposition to acquire (110)-oriented surfaced Mo nanofilms with a nanoparticle-clustering morphology. The optimized sample showed a much improved NRR performance with an ammonia formation rate of 3.09 × 10−11 mol s−1 cm−2 and Faraday efficiency of 0.72% at −0.49 V vs. RHE, far better than the untreated commercial Mo foil, especially at low overpotentials (∼100 times higher Faraday efficiency at −0.39 V). Although this value is comparable with previous reports of noble metal nanoparticles, no follow-up works have been reported thus far. The major challenge may be the difficulty in the controllable synthesis of metallic Mo nanomaterials under mild conditions compared with noble metals, where Mo and W prefer the form of quite stable polyoxometalates instead of metallic ones.
Iron. 
Fused-iron catalysts have been utilized worldwide in the industrial Haber–Bosch process for over a century, and metallic Fe is among the earliest to be examined for electrochemical NRR. In the early study by Sclafani et al.,96 metallic iron was tested as a cathode for the NRR in 6 M KOH electrolyte under ambient pressure and low temperature. A volcano-shaped relation between ammonia yield rates and applied potentials was observed, peaking at ∼1.06 V vs. SCE, reaching a maximum yield of ∼2 μmol h−1 m−2 and Faraday efficiency of around 1%. Follow-up studies since then are limited, mostly focusing on system design and parameter optimization using Fe as a reference electrode instead of structural modification of the Fe catalyst itself. This is probably due to the disappointing low NRR kinetics of Fe in alkaline media and rapid corrosion/dissolution in acidic media, and limited space of improvement compared with noble metal-based materials. Nevertheless, the much lower cost of Fe compared to Au or Ru is very appealing for future large-scale applications. In a recent study, Feng and collaborators utilized a preoxidized Fe foil as the cathode for electrochemical NRR in neutral 0.1 M PBS electrolyte at room temperature.128 With an applied reduction potential of −0.5 V vs. RHE in Ar-saturated electrolyte, the surface iron oxides (mainly α-Fe2O3) were electrochemically reduced into Fe and Fe3O4, creating a porous surface consisting of nanocrystallites with a size of about 50–100 nm. The treated Fe/Fe3O4 catalyst showed current densities 5–10 times lower than the untreated commercial Fe foil; however, with significantly higher NRR activity, achieving an ammonia formation rate of ∼0.19 μg cm−2 h−1 and Faraday efficiency of 8.29% at −0.3 V, about 25 and 120 times higher than that of Fe foil, respectively. Fe/Fe3O4 also outperformed carbon-supported Fe, Fe3O4 and Fe2O3 nanoparticles in terms of Faraday efficiency, with values of 1.9%, 0.9%, and 0.7%, respectively. The authors attributed the higher performance of the treated Fe/Fe3O4 to the metal-oxide interface, which bypassed the linear scaling and limited charge transfer kinetics at the electrode–electrolyte interface due to the lower conductivity of Fe3O4 and kinetic limitation of the PBS electrolyte. One possible factor the authors did not mention is the Mott–Schottky-type configuration of their catalyst, which served as a rectifier for forced electron transfer from Fe3O4 to Fe at cathodic potentials.
Bismuth. 
Recently, a main-group metal, specifically Bi, has drawn attention in the field of NRR. Compared with transition metals, main-group metals with semiconductivity are much less reactive towards the HER, and thus may promote the selectivity towards nitrogen reduction. Bismuth is widely studied as a photocatalyst for artificial nitrogen fixation.129 When used in the electrochemical NRR process, due to the strong interaction between Bi 6p and N 2p orbitals, Bi exhibits theoretically higher intrinsic activity than transition metals, while its semiconductive nature limits the surface electron supply and the high hydrogen adsorption energy significantly hinders HER activity, thus boosting NRR selectivity. Qiao et al. reported a two-dimensional mosaic bismuth nanosheet (Bi NS) electrocatalyst synthesized via the in situ electrochemical reduction of BiOI nanosheet microflowers.130 In 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, the Bi NS exhibited a promising ammonia yield of 13.23 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and Faraday efficiency of 10.46% at −0.8 V vs. RHE, much improved compared to that of Bi nanoparticles (Bi NP). The 2D mosaic Bi NS catalyst also showed good durability towards long-term electrolysis, retaining ∼80% of its initial activity after six cycling tests. The superior NRR performance of Bi NS over Bi NP was attributed to its special surface and electron structure, where the abundant edge Bi atoms on the mosaic nanoflakes provided delocalized p-electrons to permit end-on N2 adsorption and reduction through a distal associative pathway. The low conductivity and too positive H bonding free energy may also contribute to the NRR performance.
Yan et al. achieved one of the greatest breakthroughs in electrochemical NRR, utilizing a strategy combining Bi nanocrystals and K+-supporting cations to reach an astonishingly high NH3 Faraday efficiency of 66% and ammonia yield of 200 mmol g−1 h−1, which is the highest record for electrochemical nitrogen reduction in aqueous solution and under ambient conditions.91 DFT calculations indicated that Bi can offer a lower free energy barrier for the potential-determining step than the widely studied Au surface, which can be further decreased by K+ cations. Similar to the previously reported Li+, K+ can also modulate proton transfer on the catalyst surface by forming a dehydrated layer, which benefits the preferential adsorption of N2 molecules. Both the crystalline size of Bi and concentration of K+ in electrolyte are crucial to the NRR performance. At optimum conditions of H2SO4/K2SO4 electrolyte (pH 3.5 and 1.0 mol l−1 of K+), glassy carbon electrodes loaded with Bi nanocrystals (BiNCs) with a size of around 7.35 nm exhibited the highest NRR performance, reaching 67% Faraday efficiency at −0.60 V vs. RHE. Carbon paper electrodes with a higher Bi loading were further used to achieve a much higher geometrical-area-normalized ammonia yield of 5.2 × 10−2 mmol cm−2 h−1, with the ammonia Faraday efficiency of 66%. Noteworthily, 2% Faraday efficiency towards N2H4 was also acquired, confirming the reaction followed an alternative associative pathway. This unprecedentedly high NRR performance of the Bi–K+ system may open a new gateway for NRR research towards a really effective and selective level, which may finally meet the need for practical use.
Recently, Jiang et al. synthesized defect-rich Bi nanoplates via a low-temperature plasma bombardment approach, and applied for electrocatalytic NRR.93 One essential merit of this work is the systematic and strict ammonia quantification procedure by 15N-labelled 1H NMR quantitative measurements, which for the first time unambiguously verified the source of N from the feeding N2 gas, excluding the potential pollution and false positive issues that have aroused wide concern recently. Consequently, a Faraday efficiency of 11.68% at −0.6 V vs. RHE and 15NH3 production rate of 5.453 μg mgBi−1 h−1 at −0.9 V vs. RHE were acquired for defect-rich Bi(110) nanoplates in neutral 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. This strategy is innovative in exhibiting the importance of defects in the design of NRR electrocatalysts, but the reliable testing procedure may be more pronounced in the guidance of future works.


2.4.2. Inorganic materials for electrochemical NRR. 
The potential of pure metals towards the NRR is limited due to the linear scaling relation, and thus various inorganic materials have been developed to overcome this limitation. In 1990, Furuya and Yoshiba systematically tested a series of inorganic materials for their NRR catalytic performance from N2 and H2 in 1 M KOH solution under ambient pressure and 25 °C, including various metal oxides, metal–metal oxide composites, metal sulfides, ZnSe, TiB2 and SiC.98 PbO–TiO2 was the best among the oxides, with ∼0.273% Faraday efficiency at the beginning of electrolysis, while ZnS the highest in the sulfides. ZnSe and TiB2 showed the highest values of ammonia formation rate and Faraday efficiency, but were quickly deactivated even after 20 min of electrolysis. This early work screened many common inorganic materials, but did not find any suitable NRR catalyst with both high performance and stability. Recent research on inorganic materials for the NRR mainly includes transition metal oxides,75,131–138 nitrides,56–59,69–71,139,140 chalcogenides,141,142 phosphides,143 carbides144,145 and their composites, together with some metal-free inorganic materials such as g-C3N4,76 B4C77 and black P.146 Specially, Mo-based compound materials constitute a unique family of NRR electrocatalysts with generally high performance compared with other transition metals and will be discussed separately.
Metal oxides. 
Experimentally, the activity of metal oxides towards the NRR in alkaline solution follows the order PbO–TiO2 > Sb–SnO2 > ZnO > Sn–In2O3 > SnO2 > Fe2O3 > TiO.10 Considering that activated (in situ reduced) iron oxides are industrial ammonia synthesis catalysts widely used for over a century, hematite (α-Fe2O3) as the most thermodynamically stable form of iron oxide was first investigated for electrochemical NRR. In 2014, Licht and coworkers in their landmark work presented an electrochemical ammonia synthesis approach from air and water steam in a nano-Fe2O3 suspension in molten hydroxides at a moderately elevated temperature of 200–250 °C.37 In their system, electrocatalysis was conducted in a one-pot cell without separators using Ni as both electrodes, a highly conductive molten eutectic mixture of NaOH/KOH as the electrolyte, and Fe2O3 nanoparticles as an ammonia-generating catalyst with high surface area. At a cell voltage of 1.2 V and current density of 2 mA cm−2, a high ammonia production rate of 2.4 × 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1 was achieved with surprisingly high coulombic efficiency of 35%, corresponding to an energy cost of 59 MJ kg−1 NH3. Increasing the reaction temperature and steam pressure reduced the total cell voltage required, while increasing the current led to a decrease in ammonia selectivity to hydrogen generation. They further improved the system, replacing nano Fe2O3 with active carbon-supported Fe2O3, achieving a maximum ammonia yield of 8.27 × 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1 at 250 °C and cell voltage of 1.55 V with current density of 49 mA cm−2, while the highest efficiency of 13.7% was acquired at a cell voltage of 1.15 V.75 A subsequent DFT calculation by Gebauer et al.147 indicated that nitrogen reduction on Fe-ended hematite(0001) surfaces proceeds via an alternative associative pathway, with the potential-determining step being the addition of the first hydrogen. A double-iron (Fe–Fe–O3)-terminated surface is preferred with a lower bias potential of −1.14 V compared with a single-iron (Fe–O3–Fe)-terminated one (onset potential: −1.84 V), attributed to the two available Fe sites providing a side-on adsorption mode with shorter Fe–N bonds for N2 molecules.
The performance of iron oxides at room temperature was also investigated. Fe2O3 supported on carbon nanotubes (Fe2O3/CNT) was tested in a PEM-type cell separated by a Nafion membrane using diluted KHCO3 electrolyte in the anodic chamber, and nitrogen steam was supplied on the cathode side.131 The NRR occurred at the gas–solid interface of the gas-diffusion electrode loaded with catalysts, reaching an ammonia production rate of 0.22 μg cm−2 h−1 at −2.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl; however, with a low Faraday efficiency of ∼0.03%. The parameters were further optimized, including Fe loading, electrolyte effect (type, pH and concentration) and applied potential, with an optimum setting of 30 wt% Fe2O3–CNT in 0.5 M KOH.132 The highest performance of 1.89 × 10−11 mol cm−2 s−1 was achieved in the first 4 h at −2.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The ammonia formation rate remained stable over 24 h at −1.0 V, while it gradually decreased at more negative potentials, possibly due to the reduction of surface oxides into metallic Fe, which led to enhanced HER.
Kong et al. tested γ-Fe2O3 in both 0.1 M KOH solution and a membrane electrode reactor,133 finding that the ammonia formation rate of an MEA (0.952 μg h−1 cm−2) was significantly higher than a disk electrode by about 3-fold, while the Faraday efficiency was much lower (0.044% for MEA, and 1.9% in KOH), and the MEA suffered from severe deactivation in a 25 h continuous operation. Enriched surface oxygen-vacancies were recently found to enhance the NRR catalytic of nanostructured α-Fe2O3,134 leading to an NH3 production rate of 1.45 μg h−1 cm−2 and Faraday efficiency of 8.28% at −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.10 M KOH after 1 h of chronoamperometry testing. However, a degradation in the NRR performance was discovered over long-term operation. Currently, iron-oxide based NRR catalysts mostly suffer from poor stability, especially at low potentials where higher ammonia yields are acquired. Since the underlying degradation mechanism is unknown, further research especially in situ and operando characterizations are necessary. Additionally, other issues still exist, such as limited activity and Faraday efficiency, as well as the well-known corrosion of leached Fe ions towards the MEA reactor by Fenton reaction.148
Besides iron oxides, other metal oxides have also been investigated. Multishelled hollow Cr2O3 microspheres (MHCMs) were found to catalyze the NRR in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution with attractive activity.138 Compared with solid Cr2O3 microspheres and nanoparticles, the MHCMs with a hollow structure showed a much higher performance, achieving a high NH3 yield of 25.3 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and Faraday efficiency of 6.78% at −0.9 V vs. RHE with good stability. DFT calculations revealed that on an energetically stable (110) surface, N2 initially bonded at the bridging sites of two neighboring Cr, and the reaction should follow an associative mechanism with the potential-determining step being the addition of the first hydrogen. Although both distal and alternative pathways are exothermic, and thus available, no hydrazine was detected at all potentials tested, suggesting that the actual reaction mainly proceeded in a distal manner or hydrazine desorption was kinetically hindered. An amorphous Bi4V2O11/CeO2 hybrid (BVC-A) prepared from electrospun nanofibers (Fig. 11a) exhibited promising NRR activity in 0.1 M HCl solution with an ammonia formation rate of 23.21 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and Faraday efficiency of 10.16% at −0.2 V vs. RHE (Fig. 11b), significantly higher than that of its crystalline counterpart (BVC-C) and pure Bi4V2O11 and CeO2 (Fig. 11c).149 Amorphous Bi4V2O11 with a disordered structure and rich surface dangling bonds was found to be the catalytic active species, while CeO2 played a crucial role in inducing the formation of an amorphous structure as well as establishing band alignment to facilitate interfacial charge transfer. TiO2 as the most common metal-oxide catalyst was found to show certain NRR activity. TiO2 nanoparticles–reduced graphene hybrid (TiO2–rGO) achieved a high ammonia yield of 15.13 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and Faraday efficiency of 3.3% in 0.1 M Na2SO4, but at a very negative potential of −0.9 V vs. RHE (Fig. 12a).137

Skúlason's group screened a series of metal oxides with rutile structures for their potential towards electrochemical NRR by DFT calculation.150 Since the metal ions on a rutile(110) surface have two different types of coordination environments, two types of possible reacting sites were discovered, which are the top sites of the coordination unsaturated 5-fold coordinated metal ions (cus-sites) and the bridging sites between two 6-fold coordinated metal ions (br-sites). The activity of a surface is found to be dependent on the occupancy of br-sites due to their generally higher binding ability than cus-sites. On the stoichiometric (110) surface, br-sites are occupied by oxygen at zero potential, which are reduced at negative biased operating potentials into a clean surface or further protonated into an H-covered surface. Compared with the oxidized or reduced surface, the hydrogenated surface is the thermodynamically stable form at the predicted NRR onset potentials. NbO2, ReO2 and TaO2 stand out as the most potential NRR catalysts for rutile oxides, with onset potentials of −0.57 V, −1.07 V and −1.21 V, respectively, while the IrO2 catalyst with the lowest onset potential of −0.36 V will probably be poisoned by adsorbed hydrogen atoms (Fig. 12b). Following the guidance of this work, several Nb oxide-based catalysts were developed. Nb2O5 nanofibers synthesized by electrospinning and following calcination exhibited a high ammonia yield of 43.6 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and high Faraday efficiency of 9.26% at −0.55 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M HCl electrolyte at ambient conditions.68 Compared with Nb2O5, NbO2 nanoparticles showed much higher NRR activity in acid solution, exhibiting a peaking ammonia yield of 11.6 μg h−1 mgcat−1 at −0.65 V vs. RHE and an extraordinary maximum Faraday efficiency of 32% at −0.6 V, which surpassed that of most of the reported catalysts in aqueous solutions (Fig. 12c and d).136 The improved performance of NbO2 than Nb2O5 was attributed to the extra 4d electron facilitating the formation of back donation bonds from the metal centers to the antibonding π2p* orbit of the adsorbed nitrogen molecules, thus significantly weakening the NN bonds, while the absence of 4d electrons in Nb5+ made such back donation bonding much more difficult.
Metal nitrides. 
Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) are expected to be a family of promising NRR candidates with a unique nitrogen-exchange mannered reaction mechanism. As described previously, electrochemical NRR at the surface of TMNs is proposed to follow an MvK mechanism instead of the common associative and dissociative mechanisms, where surface nitrogen atoms from the nitride matrix are initially protonated and released as ammonia, followed by replenishing of the lattice N-vacancy by adsorbed nitrogen molecules.56–60 A series of DFT calculation revealed that the NRR on TMNs via MvK pathways may be rather complicated, involving several issues including stability of crystalline facets and surface nitrogen vacancies, kinetic barriers of nitrogen adsorption and dissociation for surface regeneration, poisoning by adsorbed oxygen and hydrogen from water, and immigration of N-vacancies into the bulk, leading to nitrogen leaching and structural collapse into corresponding metals.56,57
Various transition metal mononitrides with either rocksalt (RS) or zinc blende (ZB) structures were investigated, giving four possible candidates, ZrN, CrN, VN and NbV.57,59 The RS(100) facet should be the most effective surface for all these mononitrides with NRR onset potentials of around −0.5 to −0.8 V vs. RHE and sufficient stability. For these nitrides, single crystals with active surfaces were recommended, while for polycrystalline ones, surfaces with low activity such as ZB(100) of CrN and VN and ZB(110) of VN or unstable surfaces leading to structural decomposition such as RS(111) of CrN and VN and ZB(110) of NbN should be avoided (Fig. 13a). The RS(111) of MnN was found to have the lowest onset potential of −0.54 V compared with other RS(111) surfaces (Fig. 13b); however, the rate-determining step was the filling of dimer N-vacancies by nitrogen adsorption and dissociation, which was a highly endothermic non-electrochemical step, and thus could not be tuned by bias potentials.58 Consequently, MnN cannot be a good electrochemical NRR catalyst, but a potential catalyst for H–B ammonia synthesis.

Inspired by these DFT studies, VN-based nanomaterials including nanoparticles,69 nanosheets70 and nanowire arrays71 were investigated. A VN nanowire array grown on carbon cloth delivered an ammonia yield of 2.48 × 10−10 mol−1 s−1 cm−2 and Faraday efficiency of 3.58% at −0.3 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M HCl electrolyte with high stability and no N2H4 by-product,71 while the VN nanosheet array on Ti mesh showed a slightly lower performance with an ammonia yield of 8.4 × 10−11 mol−1 s−1 cm−2 and Faraday efficiency of 2.25% at −0.5 V (Fig. 13c), possibly due to the utilization of different substrates.70 Yan et al. performed a detailed operando mechanistic study of VN nanoparticles in acidic 0.05 M H2SO4 electrolyte using a PEM-type configuration.69 Monodispersed VN nanoparticles with a cubic rocksalt structure and an average size of 10 nm covered by carbon shells of 2–4 nm were synthesized via a urea-assisted approach and loaded onto carbon paper and assembled into an MEA for NRR testing. Ammonia formation was detected at −0.1 V and −0.2 V vs. RHE, while at lower potentials both the NH3 yield and Faraday efficiency dropped dramatically due to HER onset. The highest ammonia production rate of 3.3 × 10−10 mol−1 s−1 cm−2 and Faraday efficiency of 6.5% were achieved at −0.2 V in the first 1 h of electrolysis, which declined after 2 h to 1.1 × 10−11 mol−1 s−1 cm−2, losing 95% of the initial activity. At −0.1 V, the VN catalyst could continuously function for 116 h with an ammonia yield of 1.1 × 10−10 mol−1 s−1 cm−2 after an initial deactivation in the first 4 h. Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the existence of several vanadium oxide, oxynitride and nitride species on the surface of VN, identifying VN0.7O0.45 as the active phase towards the NRR, which was also supported by operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments, indicating the slow conversion of VN0.7O0.45 into VN along with deactivation during electrolysis. Isotopic labeling experiments using 15N2 feeding gas produced both 15NH4+ and 14NH4+, confirming the reaction followed an MvK mechanism. Therefore, they hypothesized the N sites adjacent to a surface O in the vanadium oxynitride phase were the active sites, and deactivation originated from the reductive leaching of surface oxygen followed by adsorption and dissociation of N2 molecules healing the vacancy, resulting in a completely clean VN surface, which was inactive towards the NRR due to the strong binding of nitrogen atoms (Fig. 13d). The VN catalyst exhibited extraordinary activity and selectivity about 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of noble metals in the PEMELs, in accordance with DFT calculations. However, the Faraday efficiency was far below theoretical prediction and the problematic stability still needs further optimization, while experimental trials of other predicted candidates such as ZrN, CrN and NbN are currently absent. Recently, the same group applied a novel quantitative isotopic exchange strategy to determine the density of the initial and steady-state active sites on the VNO surface.151 Following an MvK mechanism, the initially active surface 14N-nitrogens are fully exchanged by 15N using 15N2 as the feeding gas, forming 14NH3 whose amount could be determined. Similarly, in the steady state, all the active sites are covered by 15N atoms, which again can be fully exchanged by the 14N2 feed in another run into 15NH3. Their results indicate that only ∼4.2% of the N in VNO was originally active towards the NRR, while only 25% of these sites remain active during steady-state long-term running. Thus, this isotopic exchange strategy can ideally work for any NRR catalyst following the MvK mechanism, and may prove to be a strong method in studying metal nitride-based NRR catalysts.
Metal phosphides. 
Reports of metal sulfides catalyzing electrochemical NRR are scare except for the early research. In the case of metal phosphides, to the best of our knowledge, we contributed the only report to date.143 Cobalt phosphide hollow nanocages (CoP HNCs) were synthesized through the low-temperature phosphorization of a layered-double-hydroxide (LDH) intermediate using cobalt-based metal–organic framework nanocrystals (ZIF-67) as a precursor (Fig. 14a), and applied as cathode catalyst towards the NRR in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The as-acquired CoP HNCs with three-leveled hierarchical structure consisted of ultrathin (<10 nm) porous polycrystalline nanosheets assembled from ultra-small (<5 nm) CoP nanoparticles (Fig. 14b). The rich surface sites on both sides of the hollow nanocages and the cage-effect boosting stable-state concentration of the reactants inside the cages both contributed to the NRR activity. An initial high Faraday efficiency of 7.36% was observed with an average ammonia yield of 2.485 μg h−1 mgcat−1 at 0 V vs. RHE, and higher NH3 production was achieved by applying more negative potentials at the cost of a dramatic decline in current efficiency due to the pronounced HER. The maximum NH3 production rate of 10.78 μg h−1 mgcat−1 at −0.4 V was acquired; however, with much lower Faraday efficiency of 0.03% (Fig. 14c). On the contrary to previous reports of noble metals, elevating the reaction temperature was found to be unfavorable for the NRR, leading to both a reduced ammonia yield and Faraday efficiency, probably due to the lower activation barrier of the HER than the NRR.

Metal carbides. 
Carbide-based NRR catalysts are also rare. MXene as a type of transition metal carbide with 2D ultrathin layers terminated by various groups has recently shown its potential as an NRR electrocatalyst.145 DFT calculations certified an O-terminated in-plane surface will bond nitrogen weakly, and thus mainly catalyze the HER, while the most active N2 adsorption sites on a Ti3C2O2 MXene were the exposed Ti sites at the plane edges. This could be experimentally achieved by decreasing the sheet sizes and dispersion on vertically aligned substrates instead of parallel ones. Consequently, 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets with small sheet sizes loaded on stainless steel mesh (SSM) exhibited a high NRR performance with NH3 yield of 4.72 μg h−1 cm−2 and Faraday efficiency of 4.62% at −0.1 V vs. RHE in acidic 0.5 M Li2SO4 solution (pH = 2), while a higher Faraday efficiency of 5.78% was acquired loading MXene onto vertically aligned FeOOH nanosheets. The high selectivity can be attributed to the maximized exposure of edge sites and poor HER activity of the supporting metal matrix.
Mo-Based compounds. 
Specially, Mo-based compound materials constitute a unique family of NRR electrocatalysts with generally high performance compared with other transition metals. Mo is the core element in biological nitrogenases,3,4,43 and Mo-based coordination molecules are among the earliest developed molecular NRR catalysts. Molecular Mo-based catalyst systems such as the Schrock cycle42 or dimolybdenum complexes with PNP pincer ligands152 have shown considerable potential at room temperature and ambient conditions, although with limited turnover numbers (TONs), which has inspired the development of Mo-based compounds towards electrochemical NRR. Sun et al. carried out a series of experimental and theoretical studies focusing on Mo-based NRR electrocatalysts, including MoO3 nanosheet arrays,135 Mo2N and MoO2 nanorods,139 MoN140 and MoS2 nanosheet arrays,142 exhibiting maximum a Faraday efficiency of 1.9%, 4.5%, 1.3%, 1.15%, and 1.17%, respectively. Mo2N seems to be the best candidate for NRR among the materials tested, showing the highest ammonia yield of 78.4 μg h−1 mgcat−1 at −0.3 V vs. RHE;139 however, different nanomorphologies and areal mass loadings make it hard to evaluate the catalytic performance on the same standard. Electrolysis was mostly conducted in 0.1 M HCl, but MoS2 was found to exhibit generally a higher Faraday efficiency and ammonia formation rate in neutral 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte.141,142 The introduction of defects into the MoS2 lattice was found to significantly improve its NRR catalytic performance.141 Defect-rich MoS2 nanoflowers exhibited a high Faraday efficiency of 8.34% and NH3 yield of 29.28 μg h−1 mgcat−1 at −0.40 V, well-above its defect-free counterpart with 2.18% and 13.41 μg h−1 mgcat−1, respectively, in 0.1 M Na2SO4 with long-term durability, in accordance with the lower energy barrier of the potential-determining step. As indicated by DFT calculations, nitrogen reduction on defected MoS2 proceeds through the distal associative pathway, with a lower energy barrier of 0.60 eV for the potential-determining step of *NH → *NH2 compared with 0.68 eV for defect-free MoS2 (Fig. 14d). The bare Mo atoms with partial positive charges on the rim of the defect can activate the N2 molecules, leading to the depletion of electrons between N atoms (Fig. 14e and f), and defects cause the d-band center to move closer towards the Fermi level, enhancing the interaction between the catalyst surface and N2 molecules.
Wang et al. developed an Mo2C/C catalyst with Mo2C nanodots embedded in ultrathin carbon nanosheets towards electrochemical NRR in acidic 0.5 M Li2SO4 solution (pH = 2),144 showing an NH3 yield of 11.3 μg h−1 mgMo2C−1 and Faraday efficiency of 7.8% at −0.3 V. DFT calculations identified Mo2C as the major active center, and NRR followed a distal associative mechanism with no hydrazine production, while the coupling surface between oxides and carbides was proven unlikely to be the NRR active sites unlike the case of metal nitrides. Recently, Xin et al. realized an atomic-leveled dispersion of Mo–N sites on nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon matrix (SA-Mo/NPC), which was predicted by many DFT calculations to be highly active towards the NRR.74 The SA-Mo/NPC catalyst with the optimal Mo loading exhibited high NRR activity in both acidic and alkaline media, achieving the highest ammonia production rate of 34.0 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and Faraday efficiency of 14.6% in 0.1 M KOH at −0.3 V vs. RHE, and 31.5 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and 6.7%, respectively, in 0.1 M HCl at −0.25 V. The success of theoretical calculation guided catalyst design may inspire further experimental trials towards industrially applicable NRR catalysts.
Metal-free catalysts. 
Metal-free catalysts are attractive due to their low cost and low toxicity. Several metal-free inorganic compounds are also reported to show NRR activity. Carbon nitride as a widely studied photocatalyst was also shown to be a potential electrochemical NRR catalyst. Defect engineering of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) introducing N-vacancies could significantly improve the NRR performance,76 achieving an ammonia formation rate of 8.09 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and Faraday efficiency of 11.59%, about 11 times that of the defect-free PCN (0.74 μg h−1 mgcat−1) at −0.2 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M HCl solution. DFT calculations revealed the chemisorption of dinitrogen molecules on the nitrogen vacancies with a dinuclear end-on mode and electron back-donation from nearby carbon atoms, resembling the “strong activation” systems, and nitrogen reduction followed an alternative association mechanism. B4C nanosheets exhibited an attractive NRR performance with an NH3 formation rate of 26.57 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and Faraday efficiency of 15.95% at −0.75 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M HCl following an alternative associative pathway.77 Recently, black phosphorus nanosheets with few molecular layers prepared via the exfoliation method were found to exhibit promising NRR performance,146 achieving a maximum Faraday efficiency of 5.07% (−0.6 V vs. RHE) and NH3 yield of 31.37 μg h−1 mgcat−1 (−0.7 V vs. RHE) in 0.01 M HCl electrolyte. DFT calculations indicated that the electron densities of both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) concentrated on the zigzag or diff-zigzag edges, which acted as active sites for nitrogen adsorption and reduction following an alternative associative pathway. However, hydrazine desorption was very difficult due to the very high energy barriers, confirming the formation of NH3 as the dominant pathway. The development of other metal-free inorganic NRR catalysts still needs further attention.


2.4.3. Organic and inorganic–organic hybrid materials for electrochemical NRR. 
Conductive polymers. 
Conductive polymers have shown potential as metal-free NRR catalysts. In 2006, Köleli and Röpke for the first time investigated the possibility of using conductive polymers as NRR electrocatalysts. A polyaniline (PANI) film coated on Pt-plate was used as the cathode in an organic methanol/LiClO4/H+ electrolyte with the addition of H2SO4 solution as the proton source.153 High pressure was applied to increase the solubility of N2 in the electrolyte, and the reaction was conducted in a stainless steel single-chamber cell. Under the optimum conditions with a PANI film thickness of 1.5 μm, N2-pressure of 50 bar, reaction temperature of 25 °C and applied potential of −0.12 vs. NHE, a maximum Faraday efficiency of ca. 16% was acquired, whereas this value was only 1.3% at 1 atm pressure. Since the total volume of the electrolyte was not reported, estimation of the specific catalytic activity was impossible. The same group later studied the performance of polypyrrole (PPy) thin films in an aqueous 0.1 M Li2SO4/0.03 M H+ system at 60 bar N2, acquiring the optimum performance at −0.165 V vs. NHE.154 However, the current efficiency and specific activity were not reported. Interestingly in this work, the effect of various supporting electrolytes and their concentration was intensively investigated, and conclusively the influence followed the sequence of Li+ > Na+ > K+ > Cs+, indicating that ions with a smaller radius have a better catalytic performance. In 2017, Wang et al. discovered that Li+-incorporated poly(N-ethyl-benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic diimide) (PEBCD) nanosheet array directly grown on carbon cloth could deliver obvious NRR activity in aqueous 0.5 M Li2SO4 electrolyte at 25 °C and ambient pressure, with the maximum Faraday efficiency of 2.91% at −0.4 V vs. RHE and NH3 yield rate of 2.01 μg h−1 cm−2 (Fig. 15a).155 Li+ incorporation with the O sites in PEBCD played an essential role in retarding the hydrogen generation as well as the active sites for nitrogen adsorption and reduction (Fig. 15b and c), and NRR was suggested to follow an alternative association pathway with no hydrazine production due to the high energy barrier.

Metal–organic frameworks. 
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as a novel family of inorganic–organic hybrid materials have attracted tremendous attention in the field of heterogeneous catalysis.21 In the case of electrocatalysis, the direct use of MOFs in aqueous environment is mostly hindered by their poor stability towards water and acid/base. This problem can be overcome by assembling electrolyte-sensitive MOFs into MEAs for electrolysis in PEM-type cells to prevent direct contact with aqueous solutions. Three prototypical MOFs, Fe-based MIL-100(Fe), Co-based ZIF-67 and Cu-based HKUST-1, were investigated,156 showing peaking performance with NH3 yield rate of 1.87 × 10−9 mol−1 s−1 cm−2, 1.53 × 10−9 mol−1 s−1 cm−2 and 1.13 × 10−9 mol−1 s−1 cm−2 and Faraday efficiency of 1.41%, 0.93%, and 0.95%, respectively, under 1.2 V cell voltage and 80 °C. When air instead of pure nitrogen was used as the feedstock, an obviously lower NH3 yield of 1.50 × 10−9 mol−1 s−1 cm−2 was observed for MIL-100(Fe), possibly due to the lower nitrogen partial pressure and competitive ORR. The rich 3D interconnected porous structure of MOFs is beneficial for the enrichment and diffusion of reactant nitrogen molecules, while the massive atomically distributed metal ions in MOFs acting as Lewis acids are believed to be the active sites, which withdraw π-electrons from N2 molecules, weakening the NN bonds. However, no other MOFs are reported for electrochemical NRR to date, specifically, MOFs with improved conductivity and water-stability are highly favored in future research.


2.4.4. Carbon materials for electrochemical NRR. 
Carbon materials are widely used in electrochemistry due to their high conductivity and stability and low cost. For electrocatalysis, pure carbon with smooth graphite layers lack the necessary catalytic active sites, and in the case of the NRR, for dinitrogen molecules and protons to adsorb and react. For example, pure carbon nanotubes showed only a limited NRR performance of 3.44 × 10−12 mol−1 s−1 cm−2 (∼0.21 μg h−1 cm−2) in a PEMEL.131 A general strategy is to introduce heterogeneity to create an inhomogeneous distribution of electron density, typically doping with heteroatoms such as N, B and S.
N-Doping is the easiest and most common in carbon-based electrocatalysts. Nitrogen doping is generally achieved by carbonization of N-enriched precursors. Biomass is a natural source of this precursor since nitrogen is the vital constituent in most biological tissues. Yang et al. synthesized hierarchical porous carbon foams with a rich N content and large surface area (NCF) from cicada sloughs with ZnCl2 as an inorganic pore-fabricating agent.157 The as-acquired NCF possessed a high BET surface area of 1547.13 m2 g−1 and abundant micropores of around 1.92 nm and mesopores of around 25.3 nm, which benefited the mass transportation of both the electrolyte and reactant nitrogen gases, shortening their transport distance. When applied for the NRR in 0.1 M HCl solution, the NCFs achieved a maximum NH3 yield rate of 15.7 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and Faraday efficiency of 1.45% at −0.2 V vs. RHE. The NRR performance including ammonia yield and Faraday efficiency was found to be positively related with temperature and surface area, while pure carbon paper exhibited a negligible performance. Other N-containing polymers or compounds can also be used as precursors to prepare N-doped carbon. Wang et al. developed a strategy to produce free-standing nitrogen-doped carbon nanoporous membranes with a hierarchical structure (NCMs) for NRR electrocatalysis.117 The metal-free NCMs achieved an ammonia formation rate of 8 μg h−1 cm−2 (−0.3 V vs. RHE) and Faraday efficiency of 5.2% (−0.2 V) in 0.1 M HCl solution. The semiconductive NCMs with rich nanoporosity was later used as a substrate for loading Au nanoparticles, as mentioned previously. Recently, ZIF-8, as a zinc-based N-rich MOF, was utilized as a precursor to prepare N-doped porous carbon for the NRR in acid and basic media separately in two independent works.72,158 During pyrolysis in an inert atmosphere, the Zn nodes in ZIF-8 were reduced into metallic Zn, then the metal with low boiling point evaporated at high temperature, creating rich apertures without the need for additional pore-engineering agents. In acidic 0.05 M H2SO4 electrolyte, ZIF-8 derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) exhibited the optimum performance at −0.9 V vs. RHE, showing an ammonia yield of 1.40 mmol g−1 h−1 and Faraday efficiency of 1.42%.158 DFT calculations revealed both pyrrolic and pyridinic N to be active sites, and the NRR followed an alternative pathway. In a parallel study where alkaline electrolyte was applied, 1100 °C was found to be the optimum calcination temperature, reaching the maximum performance at −0.3 V vs. RHE, with an ammonia formation rate of 3.4 × 10−6 mol−1 h−1 cm−2 and Faraday efficiency of 10.2%. The NH3 yield further increased to 7.4 × 10−6 mol−1 h−1 cm−2 at an elevated temperature of 60 °C. Specially, alkaline electrolyte was found to be better suited than acid electrolyte, and KOH was preferred than NaOH.72 The much higher performance compared with the other work may be attributed to the vacancies generated at a higher calcination temperature. Consequently, carbon vacancies with 3 pyridinic N and an adjacent C (N3 sites) were proposed to be the active sites with N2 adsorption and bond activation as the rate-determining step, as predicted by DFT calculations. As proof, Fe-doping drastically decreased the catalytic performance even at a low loading of 1% since Fe coordination with the N3 sites blocked the active sites.
The introduction of electron-deficient species such as B into the carbon matrix can create a localized redistribution of electron density, which serves as a Lewis acid site for strong bonding with the Lewis basic nitrogen molecules.159 Boron-doping was introduced into graphene sheets by thermal annealing of graphene oxides and boric acids together. The resultant B-doped graphene (BG) with an optimized boron doping level and chemical composition yielded an ammonia production of 9.8 μg h−1 cm−2 and Faraday efficiency of 10.8% at −0.5 vs. RHE in 0.05 M H2SO4 electrolyte, corresponding to 5- and 10-fold increase compared to the undoped graphene. The introduction of B dopants enhanced the chemisorption of N2 as confirmed by temperature-dependent desorption (TPD) experiments, and the chemical environment of B was critical to its performance, with B3C suggested to be the catalytic active sites. DFT calculation assuming a distal associative pathway indicated that B-doping will always enhance the interaction between adsorbed N2 and graphene substrate, while the oxidized B sites bond nitrogen too strong, hindering the release of as-formed ammonia and regeneration of catalytic active sites, and thus is not ideal as the graphene-like B3C sites with suitable nitrogen binding strength.
Besides chemically modulating the composition, engineering of morphology may be an effective approach, giving specially organized nano-microstructures, which serve as the so-called “physical catalyst”. Rondinone et al. developed a special carbon nanomaterial with rough surfaces composed of sharp spikes.73 The nitrogen-doped carbon nanospike (CNS) consisted of abundant-oriented spikes of about 50–80 nm in length, ending with ∼1 nm tips, which could induce localized concentrated electric field by point discharging effect, and served as a physical catalyst. Evidently, the O-etched sample with blunt tips produced only a trace amount of ammonia under the same conditions. The cations in the electrolyte were found to play an essential role in the NRR process with the sequence of Li+ > Na+ > K+, suggesting that the smallest counterions can enhance the electric field and increase the N2 concentration near the tips, as well as forming a dehydrated cation layer surrounding the tip to prevent the access of water and positively charged protons. Consequently, under the optimized conditions, the CNS catalyst exhibited extraordinary NRR activity with an NH3 formation rate of 97.18 μg h−1 cm−2 and Faraday efficiency of 11.56% at −1.19 V vs. RHE in 0.25 M LiClO4 electrolyte, with an energy efficiency of 5.25%, being one of the best NRR catalysts discovered thus far.

2.5. General strategies and system optimization
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction is a complicated system with several parts, where optimized conditions are crucial for catalysts to reach their full potential, including a combination of reactor configuration, electrolyte, temperature, pressure, and feeding gas. These parameters are not universal, and are strongly related to the nature of active sites and reaction mechanism depending on the catalyst. During electrolysis, initially the free surface active sites are competitively adsorbed by either N2 or H. Since the reductive adsorption of hydrogen is a potential-dependent reaction while the adsorption of N2 is not, at negative potentials enough to drive the NRR, the catalyst surface will always be saturated by adsorbed hydrogens, leading to the extremely low current efficiency of ammonia formation. Nørskov et al. performed a simple analysis with some basic physical assumptions,160 concluding that the ammonia formation rate is zeroth order in the proton and electron concentration, while the hydrogen formation rate was first order in both. Therefore, strategies to improve NRR selectivity should concentrate on limiting the accessibility of electrons, protons or both. Afterwards, they proposed four possible strategies: (i) decrease the proton concentration in the electrolyte to limit the proton transfer rate, (ii) increase the barrier for proton to transfer to catalyst surface to limit the proton transfer rate, (iii) creating a thin insulating layer, which electrons have to tunnel through to limit the electron transfer rate, and (iv) using photoadsorbers to supply slow streams of electrons to limit the electron transfer rate. The feasibility of some of these suggestions (such as i and ii) has been proven by experimental evidence, while the others remain discussable. Although the N2 concentration in the solution is directly proportional to the ammonia formation rate, it will be difficult to increase the nitrogen solubility in electrolyte by orders of magnitude compared with other approaches, considering that N2 solubility in most organic solvents is at most 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than that in water. Applying high N2 pressure is one possible route, but this approach deviates from the purpose of ammonia synthesis under “benign” conditions, again resulting in an H–B-like configuration.
From the viewpoint of material design, the proton transfer rate can be modulated by engineering the chemical affinity of the catalyst surface, while the electron transfer rate can be tuned by the intentional design of band structures and forming heterojunctions. Creating a hydrophobic environment at the catalyst surface is an efficient approach to reduce the proton accessibility. One of the easiest methods is using a hydrophobic substrate to load catalysts. In the report by Wang et al.,144 both hydrophilic and hydrophobic carbon papers were used to load their Mo2C/C catalyst, providing proton-enriched and proton-suppressed reaction conditions, respectively. About a five-fold increase in Faraday efficiency was observed by utilizing hydrophobic substrates; however, at the cost of a decrease in the NH3 yield rate (11.3 μg h−1 mgMo2C−1 to 8.2 μg h−1 mgMo2C−1) and negatively shifted optimal potentials (Fig. 16a–c), indicating that the actual case may be more complex than Nørskov's assumption. Another approach is coating the catalyst surface with hydrophobic layers. Ling et al. demonstrated that by coating a porous yet superhydrophobic metal–organic framework layer at the surface of an Ag–Au bimetallic electrocatalyst, the NRR performance of the electrode including both Faraday efficiency and NH3 yield was dramatically improved (Fig. 16d and e).161 The Au electrode deposited with Ag nanocubes served as an electrocatalyst and a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) platform to monitor the local environment during electrolysis. The bifunctional zeolitic-imidazolate framework (ZIF) layer worked as a porous sorption layer to confine the intermediates during electrolysis near the catalyst surface, shortening the diffusion paths and increasing the collision probability to enhance the reaction rate, while on the other hand as a superhydrophobic barrier to block water from passing through, limiting the proton supply near the surface to suppress the HER. When applied for electrochemical NRR in an organic LiSO3CF3/tetrahydrofuran (THF) electrolyte using ethanol as the proton source, the Au–Ag@ZIF ensemble electrode exhibited an NH3 yield rate of ∼10 pmol cm−2 s−1 (∼0.623 μg cm−2 h−1) with a high Faraday efficiency of 18% at −2.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl, while the uncoated Au–Ag electrode showed much lower Faraday efficiency of 8%, with a 10% drop. Although demonstrated to be a possible general strategy to be extended to other catalytic systems, this MOF coating strategy may face challenges for wider application since a disfavored organic electrolyte system was used in this proof-of-concept work, while in more generalized aqueous media, its feasibility still needs further experimental proof, especially in a widely used acidic solution where the coating ZIF layer will be dissolved.

For the modulation of electron transfer, the contact between catalytic active sites and the matrix is substantial. For a metal catalyst in ohmic contact with the external circuit, electron flow is continuously injected into the metal at negative potentials during the reaction, and thus limiting the electron access will be impossible, although the chemical potentials can be controlled. However, for a Schottky-type contact, where a metallic layer is separated from the external electron feed by a semiconductive layer, due to the generally lower work function of semiconductors compared to metals, electrons are transferred from the semiconductor to metal, forming a localized electric field and preventing further injection of low-energy electrons. This type of catalyst is also known as Mott–Schottky catalysts, with potential in a wide range of electrocatalytic reactions,162,163 including the NRR.117,128 In this system, at the semiconductor–metal interface, the semiconductive side is positively charged, preventing the adsorption of protons by electrostatic repulsion, while the electrically neutral N2 is not affected and adsorb on the stepped interface with rich coordinatively unsaturated sites, followed by reduction with electrons and protons from the negatively charged metal side. Whether utilization of insulating layers is feasible or not still needs further verification, considering that introducing insulating components into electrocatalysts will decrease their overall conductivity, thus increasing the overall ohmic loss and energy cost. Additionally, modulation of the surface electron configuration is another feasible approach. Metals with rich valence electrons can form back-donation bonds with adsorbed N2 molecules, weakening N–N bonds by filling the antibonding molecular orbitals, such as Bi with rich 6p electrons and Nb4+ with excess 4d electrons.
Electrolyte is a key factor in the electrochemical NRR process. In the early research, mostly organic systems with low or no water content were utilized to limit the proton supply and increase the current efficiency.35,153 Molten eutectics of mixed salts or alkaline hydroxides were also applied in high-temperature NRR from nitrogen and vapor streams.37,75 For a real-mannered ammonia synthesis electrolyzer towards localized distributed application in the future, especially household ones for private farms, the use of additional chemicals and high temperature/pressure besides electricity is highly unfavorable, and NRR in aqueous electrolytes at room temperature and ambient pressure is undoubtedly the future trend. NRR is a highly potential-sensitive reaction, and as discussed above, in acidic solutions due to the protonation of as-formed NH3 into NH4+, the equilibrium potential is positively shifted, and thus lower pH is beneficial in terms of applied potentials. According to the Pourbaix diagram in Fig. 3, an area exists between the NRR line and HER line, corresponding to NRR alone in this region. However, the HER equilibrium potential is the hypothetic potential of reversible hydrogen evolution under the H2 partial pressure of 1 bar, while in real reaction conditions, especially at the beginning of electrolysis, the reaction condition is far from equilibrium, and the actual H2 concentration in both the electrolyte and gaseous headspace of the electrolysis cell is very low, leading to a positive shift in the HER onset potential. This may explain the low Faraday efficiency in some reports even above 0 V vs. RHE, although other factors such as non-faradaic capacitive charging and blocking effect may also contribute to the total current. The effect of an acidic or alkaline electrolyte is not universal, depending on the catalyst. Generally, acid solution favors higher ammonia formation rates due to the rich supply of protons, but with relatively lower Faraday efficiency due to the pronounced HER, whereas alkaline solution permits a higher Faraday efficiency. Notably, in some cases (such as ZIF-8-derived carbon with nitrogen-containing vacancies72) acid electrolyte may lead to protonation and deactivation of the active sites, and an alkaline solution outperforms in both NH3 yield and Faraday efficiency. Some recent reports discovered that neutral electrolytes such as Na2SO4 and phosphate buffer solution may hinder the mass and charge transfer, thus suppressing the HER.120,128,138,141,142
Besides pH, concentration and type of supporting electrolyte may also play a crucial role. The most reported supporting electrolyte with the best promoting effect is Li+,73,78,154,155 probably because of its smallest radius among the alkali metal ions, which creates a strong local electric field, binding more water molecules, leading to decreased proton transportation rates, as well as its similar and competitive adsorption behavior with hydrated protons on the catalyst surface. Song et al. mentioned that Li+ adsorption near the catalyst surface may result in the formation of a dehydrated cation layer induced by the strong localized electric field, preventing water and protons from passing through, while remaining accessible to N2 molecules.73 However, a recent study by Qiao's group indicated that several commercial lithium salts had a nonnegligible amount of N-contaminations such as nitrates and nitrites,164 which even in the level of ppm or below will severely interfere with the results of NRR experiments, and pretreatments such as high-temperature calcination are needed to acquire pure enough salts for electrolytes to avoid fake positives. This work also highlights some critical issues that during NRR research, not only the electrocatalyst itself, but extra attention also needs to be paid to the electrolytes and any other possible source of N-contamination throughout the reaction system.
Besides lithium salts, K+ was also discovered to show similar promotion effects under high concentrations. In the recent work by Yan et al., the significant promoting effect of K+ towards Bi-based catalytic system was demonstrated.91 When the K+ concentration in the electrolyte increased from 0.2 to 1.0 mol L−1, the Faraday efficiency of Bi nanocrystals increased dramatically from 9.8% to 67%, with a decrease in the apparent activation energy from 30.6 to 13.7 kJ mol−1. High concentration K+ could also suppress the competing HER process by increasing the kinetic barrier of proton migration from the bulk solution to the catalyst surface. A similar promotion effect was also found for other metals such as Au and Pt, but not as significant as that of Bi. This K-promotion phenomenon is consistent with that observed in the molecular Fe–K system, where the three Fe centers in the low-coordinate iron complex with an Fe3N2 core cooperate to break the N–N triple bonds and further yield ammonia by reaction with acid or H2.165 On the metallic Fe–K system for the H–B process, K+ is believed to promote nitrogen dissociation by enriching the electron density of surface iron atoms, while in molecular systems direct K+–N2 interactions may also contribute to the promotion effect. Whether this mechanism of potassium-promotion effect applies for electrocatalytic systems or not still needs further experimental validation.
The extremely low solubility of dinitrogen gas in aqueous media is one of the major causes of very low NRR Faraday efficiency and ammonia yield. Ionic liquids (ILs) are found to be a potential candidate for efficient NRR, considering that the aprotic environment with trace amount of water can greatly suppress the HER, and high nitrogen solubility can be achieved by intentional molecular design. MacFarlane et al. developed a series of aprotic, highly fluorinated ionic liquids as electrolytes for the NRR.166,167 Their initial trial included the use of two ILs with known high nitrogen solubility, [C4mpyr][eFAP] and [P6,6,6,14][eFAP], in combination with a high-performance nanostructured iron H–B catalyst as the cathode catalyst.166 Nitrogen reduction in these highly fluorinated ILs with high N2 solubility and low water content (100 ppm) exhibited an astonishing high Faraday efficiency of 60% using electrodeposited Fe catalysts at −0.8 V vs. NHE; however, with a relatively low yield at the level of ∼1 μg cm−2 h−1 due to limited proton supply and high viscosity. For comparison, another IL with low N2 solubility, [HMIM][NTf2], was found to show a limited FE of only 0.64%. The performance of the system was further improved by a selected combination of α-Fe nanorods as catalysts and a mixture of aprotic fluorinated solvent–ionic liquid as the electrolyte. Aprotic fluorinated solvents have nitrogen solubility of up to more than 25 times that of water, and thus greatly enhance the nitrogen solubility. Additionally, these solvents are well miscible with ionic liquids such as [C4mpyr][eFAP], greatly decreasing the viscosity of the electrolyte, and thus overcoming the severe mass transport issue of pure ILs. Consequently, an ammonia yield of ∼2.35 × 10−11 mol s−1 cmGSA−2 (3.71 × 10−13 mol s−1 cmECSA−2) was achieved with an FE of ∼32%. Their results indicated the importance of the design of THE electrode–electrolyte system, instead of THE electrode alone. However, it is noteworthy that the synthesis of these N2-philic ILs and fluorinated solvents is always complicated, making them extremely costly and impossible for large-scale applications.
Another family of electrolytes is solid electrolytes, typically, polymer-gel conductive electrolytes in PEM-type cells. There have been some reports that NRR catalysts behave quite differently in aqueous solutions and PEM cells,69,123,133 probably because of the distinct proton-conducting mechanism. However, PEMELs may be one of the final forms of commercial ammonia synthesis electrolyzers, and thus the optimization of catalysts within an actual assembled MEA is necessary. In PEM cells, the NRR actually takes place at the gas–solid interface instead of the gas–liquid–solid three-phase interface in aqueous solution, with protons provided by the solid electrolytes. Proton-conductive polymers, represented by Nafion membranes, are the most widely used polymer electrolytes in electrochemistry due to their high proton conductivity, especially at slightly higher temperatures (∼80 °C). Catalysts in PEM cells generally exhibit much lower Faraday efficiency but higher NH3 yield in some cases compared to that in aqueous solution in conventional H-type cells.69,133 The utilization of a PEM cell can also avoid the stability issue of some water- or acid/base-sensitive catalysts in aqueous electrolyte.156
The effect of temperature and pressure is similar. In a series of research focusing on conductive polymer catalysts, Köleli et al. exhibited that by applying high pressure of 50–60 bar, the Faraday efficiency of the NRR could be significantly enhanced by more than an order.153,154 However, special metal electrolysis cells are needed for the harsh reaction conditions, and additional pressuring equipment will be necessary in commercial applications. In the case of temperature, heating below 100 °C is relatively easy to achieve compared to compression, and many reported catalysts perform better at moderately elevated temperatures due to thermal activation. Nevertheless, only limited works have reported the temperature effect, which remains unclear for many materials, and temperature-dependent NRR activity data is highly encouraged in future works.
The design of the experimental setup may also prove critical in evaluating an electrochemical NRR system. In the review article by Cui et al., several reported NRR electrolysis cells were summarized, including single-cells, H-type cells, back-to-back cells and PEM-type cells.28 Centi's group was among the first to propose a PEM-type cell,131,132 where the cathodic electrocatalyst is loaded on a gas-diffusion layer (GDL) directly in contact with the membrane to form a membrane-electrode assembly (MEA), and electrochemical nitrogen reduction takes place at the solid–gas interface in a flow manner to avoid the competing HER. This setup is easy to scale-up, and the ammonia synthesized can be easily recovered from the gas flow instead of diluted aqueous solutions. Kong et al. discovered that a nanosized γ-Fe2O3 catalyst performed distinctly in 0.1 M KOH in an H-cell and in an MEA-based back-to-back cell.133 The ammonia yield in the MEA device increased dramatically by 3-fold compared to that with a disk electrode in liquid electrolyte due to enhanced dispersion and utilization of the catalyst particles; however, a severe decline in Faraday efficiency from 1.9% to 0.044% was also observed. Additionally, during 25 h electrolysis, the catalyst performance significantly decreased due to ammonia adsorption on the membrane and catalyst surface. For a practical ammonia electrolyzer, there remains many challenges, such as scalable setups, ammonia harvesting, and membrane degradation.
In general, the development of NRR catalysts is not simply the screening of materials, but combined experimental/computational research including optimization of a series of parameters and system designs. A good NRR catalytic system is not only an electrocatalyst, but the combination of a catalyst and optimized reaction parameters including electrolysis cell configuration, electrolyte, potential, temperature, and pressure. DFT calculations have shown special contribution in searching for potential new catalyst candidates as well as understanding the reaction mechanism and origin of catalytic activity for as-found catalysts. The puzzle of NRR catalysts still misses a large part, with numerous possible materials to be evaluated, among which hides the final key to a green and efficient ammonia economy in the future.
2.6. Challenges and prospects
Despite the efforts of over half a century, electrochemical NRR still faces significant challenges both scientifically and technically. One major challenge widely remaining is the ultralow yield of ammonia during the NRR, and the consequent issue of the nitrogen source. Recently, several scientists and groups have appealed for the careful validation of nitrogen sources during the NRR process, as comprehensively discussed above. The reliability of published data has recently become a widely concerning issue by the whole NRR community. Data reliability is undoubtedly the baseline of any NRR study, and until a high yield of ammonia at the ∼mg mmol−1 or higher level can be achieved, sophisticated testing protocols including blank/Ar controls and isotopic labeling are still needed to guarantee the source of the ammonia produced. Most of the early works before 2017 were reported without any isotopic labeling experiments, including some using nitrate or other nitrogen-containing precursors.88,92 Thus, the reliability of these early data may need further verification. Even for those with 15N-labeling experiments, most were conducted without any pre-purification of the commercial 15N2 gas, leaving possible contamination issues, and only qualitative measurements were performed in most cases.79,93 Thus, in future research, stricter control to exclude any possible N-contamination is needed, and techniques using gas-tight circulation systems and 15N-quantification can reduce the chance of a fake positive to the greatest extent.
A more direct and essential solution to this issue is to raise the produced ammonia level to ∼mg mL−1, in which way the product concentration will be about a thousand times the errors and turbulences. To date, over half of the elements in the periodic table have been investigated as electrocatalysts towards the NRR, but still no benchmark catalyst has been found. Noble metals, especially Au and Ru, due to their rich early studies, have occupied almost half of the research interests of this field. However, theoretical studies show discouraging prospects towards these materials, besides their ridiculously high cost, making their widespread application impossible. For noble-metal-based NRR catalysts to realize practical use, the content of metal in the materials has to be decreased considerably, such as below 1% (such as SACs), while both the ammonia yield and Faraday efficiency have to further increase by an order of magnitude higher than current state-of-the-art materials. Non-noble-metal-based catalysts face similar constraints of low yield and FE, but there remains rich space for further investigation since the current reports of metal composites are still rather limited. We are particularly interested in two types of materials: main-group metals and their compounds, such as Bi, Sn and Sb, and also Mo-based materials for their similarity with biological nitrogenases. Metal-free catalysts, typically doped carbon materials, are attractive low-cost NRR catalyst candidates, but currently the reported cases require overpotentials higher than metallic catalysts. Importantly, the concept of “physical catalysts” may prove essential in further improving the NRR performance by optimization of both composition and morphology. Besides developing new catalyst materials, systematic design may compensate the limitations. By increasing the effective area of the working electrode and decreasing the volume of electrolyte used, combined with a gas-circulation system, the concentration of produced ammonia in the system can be readily increased. In any case, discovering a really “working” monument modelling catalyst may fundamentally solve the current difficulties.
In conclusion, we comprehensively reviewed in this part the progress on the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction based on the utilization of carefully selected catalyst materials with a well-designed nanomorphology. The NRR at heterogeneous surfaces in aqueous solution generally follows an association mechanism, either distal or alternative, while transition metal nitrides follow a unique MvK reaction pathway mediated by the generation and healing of surface N-vacancies. The combination of DFT calculations and experimental efforts is crucial for discovering and developing efficient NRR electrocatalysts. Typically, Au and Ru in noble metals, Mo in transition metals, VN, NbO2, Cr2O3, hetero-doped carbon, conductive polymers and their compounds/composites are selected as potential NRR catalysts for deeper research in the future. Most catalysts can produce solely NH3 as the NRR product, while Au is found to be able to produce N2H4 in some cases. The electrolyte effect, especially the promoting effect of supporting Li+ in solution, is important for optimizing the catalytic performance. Key criteria including ammonia formation rate, Faraday efficiency, selectivity, stability and energy efficiency are needed to evaluate the overall performance of a catalyst. Importantly, we propose here a simple method to estimate the total energy efficiency including the NRR and HER, showing a new way of thinking focusing on the efficient utilization of electric energy beyond simply increasing NRR activity and selectivity.
3. Electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR)
Ammonia, with its high global annual output, worldwide sources and high hydrogen contents and heat value, can be considered a potential energy carrier either as a direct power source or as a hydrogen carrier for storage, transportation and onsite hydrogen generation. In the previous part, we considered a combustion-like oxidation reaction of ammonia (339.2 kJ mol−1) (eqn (17)). As an energy carrier, ammonia easily exceeds liquid hydrogen in terms of both volumetric and mass energy densities,32 in the same level with coal and oil.31 However, pure ammonia is nonflammable with a high ignition point of 651 °C, and thus is not implemented as a direct fuel in our current age of internal combustion engines. Consequently, ammonia is mostly considered a potential hydrogen carrier instead of a direct power source. One more concern for ammonia to be utilized for energy applications is that the major amount of ammonia (>80%) is used in agriculture for the production of nitrogen fertilizers to meet the pressure of the rapidly growing population, with over 10% of the global population still undernourished, including more than 200 million children.14 Given this circumstance, it will be hard to spare the limited industrial ammonia supply for energy applications with other alternatives. Although ammonia widely exists as a water pollutant in wastewater and water bodies in agricultural regions, collection and harvesting energy from these low-concentration ammonia solutions with complex components is substantially impossible using current industrial techniques. Electrochemical processes open the gate for a cost- and energy-efficient solution for energy-harvesting from ammonia combined with water purification by assembling an ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) process with other electrocatalytic processes such as the HER and ORR.
A typical anodic AOR process in alkaline aqueous solution can be presented as follows: NH3·H2O(aq.) + 3OH− ⇌ 1/2N2(g) + 4H2O(l) + 3e− E0 = 0.092 V(29)which can be regarded as the reverse reaction of NRR, sharing the same equilibrium potential. Currently, the research on the AOR mainly focuses on three aspects, hydrogen generation, direct ammonia fuel cells, and water purification.
Ammonia is a promising liquid-phase chemical hydrogen material with a high hydrogen content (17.76 wt%).168 Full realization of an ideal “green” hydrogen economy is hindered by numerous issues, mostly due to some fundamental but fatal drawbacks of hydrogen itself. Hydrogen is extremely inflammable, explosive and volatile, making it costly and dangerous for storage and transportation.169 The current technique of compressing hydrogen into high-pressure cylinders may cost up to 30% of its total energy content, while in the liquid form with a relatively high volumetric energy density, extremely low temperature and/or high pressure are required, leading to the additional cost of cryogenic infrastructures and safety issues such as leakage and hydrogen embrittlement.170 Although it is a carbon-free clean energy source, about 95% hydrogen in industry is currently produced by steam reformation and water-gas shifting reaction from methane, which is a carbon-intensive fossil-fuel-based process.171 The more “green” electrochemical water splitting accounts for only 4% of the global hydrogen production,172 and this process is essentially not a thermodynamically favored reaction, utilizing substantially more energy compared with hydrocarbon-based processes.47 On the other hand, ammonia can be easily liquefied at room temperature and pressure as low as 8 bar into liquid ammonia with volumetric hydrogen density 1.7 times of that of liquid hydrogen.34 Traditional industrial ammonia decomposition is catalyzed by expensive Ru-based catalysts at high temperature and pressure using high-purity ammonia stream,173 while electrochemical ammonia splitting combining the AOR and HER (eqn (30)) can be conducted in diluted ammonia alkaline aqueous solution at room temperature and ambient pressure, preferably catalyzed by non-noble metal electrocatalysts, as we will mention in the following parts. Compared to the 1.23 V high cell voltage required for water splitting, an electrochemical “ammonia splitting” cell needs only 0.092 V in alkaline media, dramatically decreasing the energy cost by about 95% in theory. Additionally, hydrogen has to be synthesized following sophisticated industrial procedures, whereas ammonia can be obtained from rich sources with various concentrations, including commercial feedstock, onsite generation by electrocatalysis or photocatalysis, and N-rich wastewater from sewage, industrial discharge and fertilizer runoff. More importantly, a worldwide industrial ammonia production-transport-storage network is already well-established with rich experience in accidental handling, which can be easily plugged-in into a hydrogen energy system, while such infrastructure and knowledge for liquid hydrogen mostly remain absent. NH3·H2O(aq.) ⇌ 1/2N2(g) + 3/2H2(g) + H2O(l)(30)Compared with the indirect use of ammonia as a hydrogen reservoir, directly using ammonia as fuel is more efficient, saving the energy lost during hydrogen generation and issues related to hydrogen handling. Although the inflammability of ammonia hinders its use in internal combustion engines, a direct ammonia fuel cell (DAFC) should bypass this issue, enabling energy harvesting through the efficient electrochemical ammonia oxidation process instead of a Carnot cycle with thermodynamically limited efficiency.174–178 A DAFC can be assembled by coupling the AOR with the cathodic ORR following eqn (17). As an ecofriendly system, the DAFC produces only harmless water and dinitrogen, involving no carbon emission, and thus is free of the issues such as methanol crossover, CO poisoning and carbon deposition commonly occurring in carbon-based fuel cells. Different from ammonia electrosplitting where an external electricity input is required, a DAFC can theoretically deliver a cell voltage of 1.138 V, approaching the 1.23 V of a direct hydrogen fuel cell (DHFC). To compensate the relatively high kinetic activation barrier of the AOR, DAFCs typically operate at elevated temperatures with distinct reactor configurations with ammonia electrolysis, using solid oxide,178 polymer membrane/gel175 and molten salt electrolytes174 instead of aqueous solutions, and possibly using liquid anhydrous ammonia as feedstock to improve the energy/power density and avoid the formation of unwanted hazardous oxynitride byproducts. The different reaction configurations may induce extra consideration for electrocatalyst design, concerning the different charge carriers in electrolytes and related reaction pathways.179
Compared with energetic concerns, the environmental significance of the AOR is more pronounced. Nitrogen contamination in surface and near-ground water bodies has become a worldwide environmental issue and health threat to the population as an unexpected side effect of a hundred years of the flourishing nitrogen industry based on H–B ammonia synthesis.180–182 However, the revolutionary development in ammonia yield has led to a drastic decline in N utilization efficiency in agriculture, with the global nitrogen-use efficiency of cereals decreasing from ∼80% in 1980 to only ∼30% in 2000.183 This ultralow nitrogen-use efficiency indicates a great waste of energy used in the H–B process and related enormous carbon emission, and more seriously the large amount of active nitrogen released into the environment. The wide existence of unwanted ammonia in agriculture or stockbreeding runoff, industrial discharge and urban sewage has resulted in unintentional fertilization, leading to the eutrophication of water bodies and consequent algae overgrowth, threatening the aqueous ecosystems and fisheries industry.10,184 The presence of ammonia is also a potential health threat to human beings, causing potential carcinogenesis probably due to the biological nitrification of ammonia to biohazardous nitrites (NO2−).181 Beyond several well-developed commercial ammonia-rich wastewater purification approaches, including bacterial degradation, breakpoint chlorination and air-stripping with their own drawbacks, the electrochemical AOR process offers an easy, cheaper, efficient and scalable solution for ammonia removal in wastewater without the need for additional chemicals, delicately controlled conditions and costly infrastructure.180,181 Additionally, the AOR for ammonia removal is not sensitive to temperature, ammonia concentration and interference from co-existing pollutants, producing inert N2 and water as the products in aqueous environment, and the as-produced hydrogen during electrolysis can be readily recycled to compensate the electricity cost.
To realize the above-mentioned applications, a highly efficient electrocatalyst is indispensable. Unlike the case of the NRR where a variety of catalysts are screened but still a benchmark catalyst has not been found, research on AOR electrocatalysts mostly focuses on two major categories, noble-metal Pt-based materials, and non-noble-metal Ni or nickel hydroxide-based materials. In the following parts, we will first give a brief introduction on some of the classic reaction mechanisms proposed for these typical catalysts, as well as the experimental efforts to enhance the catalytic performance through the delicate construction of advanced nanostructures. Although various reaction systems with different electrolytes have been developed as mentioned above, here we will focus on the aqueous alkaline system, which is the most popular and potential candidate for large-scale commercial applications.
3.1. Reaction mechanism of electrocatalytic AOR

3.1.1. Reaction pathways of the AOR. 
Ammonia exists in different forms in aqueous solution depending on pH, and thus herein the AOR is a pH-sensitive reaction, following different pathways in acidic or alkaline environments. An alkaline medium is favored both thermodynamically and kinetically, considering the lower oxidation onset potential (Fig. 3), the molecular form of ammonia, and rich supply of OH− groups for hydrogen stripping. In contrast, in acidic solution, ammonia is protonated into its positively charged ionic form of NH4+, which is coulombic-repulsive to the similarly positively charged catalyst surface at oxidative potentials, with chemical/electrochemical corrosion issues.185,186 Experimental evidence also indicates the unfavorable condition with low efficiency and sluggish kinetics for the AOR in acidic electrolytes.187 In alkaline environments, ammonia oxidation occurs via the initial adsorption of ammonia onto the catalyst surface, with subsequent oxidation by OH− ions in the electrolyte. Since the pKa of NH4+ is 9.25, pH above this value is favored for the electrolyte. During electrolysis, ammonia oxidation occurs at the anode, generating ideally only N2 and H2O through a six-electron pathway, consuming two NH3 molecules per N2, but byproducts such as hydrazine and oxygenated nitrogen species may also be found occasionally due to incomplete oxidation or water oxidation-induced side reactions.
The mechanism of the AOR in alkaline aqueous solutions can be mainly classified into two categories: (i) sequential dehydrogenation of ammonia into N-adatoms, and N–N coupling to form N2; and (ii) dimerization of partially-hydrogenated *NHx (x = 1, 2) species into hydrazine-like *N2Hx (x = 2, 3, and 4) N-dimers, and their subsequent oxidation into N2. The former was first proposed by Oswin and Salomon IN 1963, denoted as the Oswin–Salomon (O–S) mechanism or N + N mechanism in this review.188 The latter, originally proposed by Gerischer and Mauerer in 1970,189 is referred to as the Gerischer–Mauerer (G–M) mechanism here. The reaction pathways of both mechanisms are shown in Fig. 17 for clarity. Both reaction pathways start with the adsorption of a free NH3 molecule in solution on the catalyst surface to form an adsorbed NH3 admolecule (*NH3), followed by multiple electrochemical steps of deprotonation with the assistance of OH-groups, removing one pair of an electron and an H2O molecule per step, as well as a chemical N–N association step. The major difference between these two mechanisms is the sequence of N–N bond association during the reaction, where in the Oswin–Salomon mechanism, N–N coupling occurs as the last step before N2 desorption, but not until the full dehydrogenation of ammonia, while in the Gerischer–Mauerer mechanism, N–N association can occur at any step during hydrogenation, and N2 formation originates from the N2Hx dimers. The Gerischer–Mauerer mechanism is more complicated, where after the initial dehydrogenation of adsorbed *NH3 into *NH2, the *NHx species can either continue deprotonation or undergo dimerization into *N2Hx, and the *N2Hx dimers then follow sequential dehydrogenation until fully oxidized into N2. Notably, in the Gerischer–Mauerer mechanism, the sequential deprotonation of a single ammonia into an N-adatom like that in the Oswin–Salomon mechanism is also possible, but leads to catalyst poisoning by N-saturation rather than N–N association into N2 due to the significant stabilization of N adatoms on transition metal surfaces as strong as 394 kJ mol−1.

3.1.2. Kinetics of the AOR. 
The preference of the Gerischer–Mauerer mechanism over the Oswin–Salomon mechanism is indicated by several experimental190–192 and computational187,193 works, while in reality both mechanisms may proceed in competition directed by both reaction thermodynamics and kinetics. As the reverse reaction of the NRR sharing a similar set of intermediates, the kinetics of AOR should also be dominated by a similar linear scaling relation strongly related to the nitrogen binding strength on the catalyst surface. It is noteworthy that in both mechanisms, the N–N association step is always a non-electrochemical process depending on the nature of the catalyst instead of externally applied potentials, and thus herein the potential-determining step may not always be the rate-determining step, in which case a low onset potential does not imply a higher activity due to the high activation energy barrier of the N–N bonding step. For the NRR where all the elementary steps are electrochemical, the activation energy barrier could always be overcome by applying more negative potentials, and the major concern arises from the competing HER. In contrast, in the AOR process, the existence of the chemical N–N coupling step and the poisoning of catalyst surface by *N adatoms are severe issues, rendering many candidate materials totally inactive despite their overpotentials, greatly limiting the choice of possible catalysts.
In the representative DFT calculation work by Herron et al.,194 a series of transition metals were investigated for catalytic activity towards AOR on their most thermodynamically stable close-packed single-crystal facets, considering both the Gerischer–Mauerer and Oswin–Salomon mechanisms. The metals investigated included Au, Ag, Cu, Pd, Pt, Ni, Ir, Co, Rh, Ru, Os and Re in the sequence of increasing *N bonding strength. The recombination of two *N adatoms into N2 was always found to be with extremely high activation barriers despite the exergonic nature of the process, hinting the sluggish removal kinetics of *N once formed, leading to poisoning of the catalyst. Consequently, the AOR following the Oswin–Salomon mechanism will always lead to N-poisoning and deactivation. Herein, a prerequisite for a material to be AOR active is to form N2 at a lower potential than *N, corresponding to a lower onset potential for the Gerischer–Mauerer mechanism than the Oswin–Salomon mechanism, enabling the AOR in a limited potential window between the two onset potentials. Among all the metals examined, Pt was shown to be the landmark candidate for the AOR, as already proven by many experimental reports. The minimum-energy pathway for the AOR on the Pt(111) surface was found to be the Gerischer–Mauerer mechanism, starting from the deprotonation of *NH3 into *NH2, followed by hydrazine formation and then sequential deprotonation finally into N2 (Fig. 18a). The rate-determining step is N–N association from two *NH2 species into hydrazine, while the potential-determining steps are two equally difficult steps, the first deprotonation of *NH3 or *N2H4, with an onset potential of 0.28 V. On the other hand, the Oswin–Salomon mechanism has a higher onset potential of 0.52 V, with the last deprotonation step of *NH into *N as the potential-determining step. The Gerischer–Mauerer mechanism should deliver a much higher activity than the Oswin–Salomon mechanism with the rate constant of the N–N coupling step ∼20 orders of magnitude higher at room temperature and a lower onset potential. As a result, the Pt(111) surface will be active in the potential range between 0.28 V and 0.52 V, and deactivate above 0.52 V, in good accordance with the experimental range of 0.5 V to 0.65 V, considering the polycrystalline nature of actual catalysts and other factors such as solvation and electrolyte effects. An independent DFT calculation work by Skachkov et al.193 indicated contradictorily that on the Pt(100) facet, the AOR can proceed at moderate potentials (>0.5 V) following the Oswin–Salomon mechanism instead of deactivation due to the different surface geometries and N-adsorption on the bridge sites, while at lower potentials (<0.5 V) both mechanisms will be competitive, although with much lower activity than at higher potentials.

Accordingly, the AOR on other metal surfaces was also examined, with the onset potentials and corresponding potential-determining steps by both mechanisms shown in Fig. 18b. With Pt as the watershed, coinage metals (Au, Ag, and Cu) binding N weaker than Pt can form N–N bonds between surface adsorbed nitrogen species more easily with much lower activation energy barriers, but the electrochemical deprotonation of *NHx or *N2Hx species will be rather difficult, leading to high AOR onset potentials far beyond feasibility. As shown in the free-energy diagram in Fig. 18c, for the AOR on the Cu(111) surface at 0 V, the rate-determining step is not N–N coupling but the deprotonation of *NH into *N with a much higher energy barrier than Pt. Increasing the potential can lower the barrier of this electrochemical step, and the G–M mechanism was predicted to have the same activity with Pt, which is higher than the O–S mechanism. However, the overpotential required is an unacceptably high value of 1.22 V, in agreement with the experimental results that Cu is not an AOR-active catalyst. Similar to Cu, Au and Ag also require large onset potentials to initiate the reaction. Consequently, coinage metals will not be active towards the AOR, but instead undergo electrodissolution via the formation of M(NH3)xy+ complexes with ammonia. For Pd, which only has a slightly weaker N-bond strength than Pt but is experimentally inactive, the reaction will be hindered by the high barrier of hydrazine formation due to the unfavorable low coverage of the top-site *NH2 species, instead of *N poisoning.
For metals binding N stronger than Pt, the N–N association barrier will be even higher, leading to a decrease in intrinsic activity despite the lower onset potentials in some cases. Herein, a volcano plot was established in terms of activity following both mechanisms at 0 VRHEvs. *N binding energy (Fig. 18d), where the less negative activity, the better. Although the calculated onset potential follows the sequence of Co < Pd < Pt < Ir < Ni < Cu, the calculated catalytic activity is Pt > Ir > Cu > Pd > Rh > Co, where experimentally, Pd, Rh and Co are inactive. Reactions following the G–M mechanism will always have higher activities than the O–S mechanism, except for Cu, where the activities of both mechanisms are the same. Due to the existence of a non-electrochemical N–N bonding step, the activity line did not follow well with an ideal volcano shape, while an optimized AOR catalyst should be well-balanced between the electrochemical proton-electron transfer and chemical N–N bond formation steps. Based on our calculations, we propose that an ideal AOR catalyst should have an N binding strength between Pt and Cu, at the intersection point where the rate-determining step switches between electrochemical deprotonation and N–N association, and thus alloying may herein be an exploitable approach in future catalyst design.
Despite the intrinsic activity of catalysts, the AOR is a highly surface-sensitive reaction, which is influenced severely by adsorbate species either initially existing in the electrolyte (such as OH−) or in situ generated at operating oxidizing potentials (such as *N, *NHx, *N2Hx, and *NOy). Surface enrichment of adsorbates at different potential ranges will impact both N2 selectivity and reaction kinetics. At a low applied potential range, ammonia can be oxidized into N2 with 100% selectivity, while at a much more positive potential, several competing processes will occur. (i) In the range above the water oxidation onset potential, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) may become pronounced with OH− groups occupying the active sites, competing with the coulombic efficiency of the AOR. (ii) Above the onset potential of the O–S mechanism, the formation of *N adatoms and subsequent surface oversaturation will occur, leading to poisoning and catalyst deactivation. (iii) At a high potential, the catalyst surface will become oxidized, facilitating the generation of oxygenated nitrogen species (such as NO and N2O). All these side reactions lead to either a decrease in the Faraday efficiency of the AOR, selectivity towards N2, formation of disfavored products, or simply the break-down of catalyst performance. Consequently, the AOR is limited not only to few types of available metal materials, but also to a certain potential window. Slightly weakened N binding strength or a low *N saturation coverage like in the case of Ir can help to expand this possible potential window.

3.2. Electrocatalysts for the AOR
Since the early reports of Pt-based AOR catalysts, there have been great efforts to search for alternative materials to enhance the activity or lower the cost of Pt catalysts. However, the experimental screening of a series of transition metals by de Vooys et al. gave a quite discouraging result.195 For all the metals tested including Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, Ir, Cu, Ag and Au, only Pt and Ir could selectively oxidize ammonia into N2 in the steady-state. The 4d metals, Ru, Rh and Pd, showed totally no activity or only transient N2 formation due to their higher N adatom binding energy, while the coinage metals Cu, Ag and Au bonded ammonia too weak to enable the G–M pathway towards N2 production, but instead electrodissoluted by the formation of stable metal ion–ammonia complexes. At positive enough potentials where surface oxides are formed, most metals were found to produce oxynitrides such as N2O and NO instead of the harmless N2. The onset potential where the AOR or N-poisoning occurred was found to be in good correlation with the surface atomic nitrogen binding strength, while Ir seemed to be an exception, which was later explained by DFT calculations owing to the lower G–M onset potential (0.32 V) than the potential of *N formation (0.50 V). Unfortunately, Ir is also a noble metal and is even more expensive than Pt. Ni and nickel hydroxides were later found to be potential AOR catalysts with much lower cost and better electrochemical stability, and thus developed in the recent decade into a major family of Pt-free catalysts.
Currently, the reported materials for AOR electrocatalysts can be grouped into three categories: (i) Pt-based materials, including pure Pt, Pt-based alloys and their nanocomposites; (ii) Ni-based materials, including Ni, nickel hydroxides and Ni–Cu composites; and (iii) other Pt-free catalysts. Metallic Pt, which is the most early-developed and well-researched active material for ammonia oxidation, is still the state-of-the-art AOR catalyst; however, its largescale industrial utilization is severely limited by its scarcity, high cost and instability, as in the case of other potential energy applications such as hydrogen fuel cells. Thus, the development of Pt-free catalysts is necessary for an economically efficient AOR process for practical use in wastewater purification and direct fuel cells. Efforts in the search of such noble-metal-free candidates are of particular interest, and will be the emphasis of this part. It is worth noting that despite the electrocatalyst design, the AOR process is affected by many parametric issues including concentration of alkali and ammonia, existence of other species in solution (such as NO3−), temperature, electrode substrate and even the electrochemical testing conditions. Different testing methods selected may apply nonnegligible effects to the catalyst performance, even leading to controversial conclusions, especially for Pt-containing materials. A detailed discussion of this topic has been presented elsewhere and is beyond the scope of this review,29 and thus we focus on the compositional and structural design of the core electrocatalysts.

3.2.1. Pt-Based materials for the AOR. 
The phenomenon of ammonia electrooxidation was discovered by Müller and Scheller dating in 1905,196 in aqueous NaOH solution using smooth Pt as the anode, yielding N2, sodium nitrates and nitrites. The first demonstration of a “usable” AOR catalyst was reported by Katan and Galiotto in 1963, utilizing a Pt electrode by depositing black Pt on sintered Ni in 3 M NH3 + 6.9 M KOH at 18 °C, producing N2 almost stoichiometrically with an average Faraday efficiency of 99.7 ± 1.7% at current densities ranging from 10 to 100 mA cm−2.197 Later in the same year, Oswin and Salomon proposed the sequential deprotonation-nitrogen recombination pathway as the very first possible mechanism of electrochemical AOR on the Pt surface.188 Simons et al. recently demonstrated the potential application of AOR in direct ammonia fuel cells (DAFCs) using flowing gaseous ammonia and air stream as the feedstock, aqueous KOH solution as the electrolyte, and Teflon-bonded unsupported Pt black or graphite-supported Pt on Pt mesh as the electrodes.198 The ammonia-air fuel cells achieved a power density of 50 mW cm−2 at 0.5 V at 120 °C, indicating their potential application as a carbon-free power source. Marinčić and Leitz proposed the AOR as an efficient method for ammonia removal in wastewater.199 By electrolysis in a continuous flow bench scale electrolytic cell, measurable oxidation rates at an ammonia concentration as low as 2 mg L−1 could be observed; however, only pure Pt was found to enable the reaction with a reasonable rate among many platinized substrates tested including graphite, Ti and Ta, rendering the process economically unfeasible.
Although many subsequent works focused on improving the activity/stability of Pt-based AOR catalysts or investigating reaction pathways and intermediates, mostly commercial Pt catalysts such as Pt black and Pt/C or electrodeposited smooth Pt thin films were used, while the modification of nanostructures remains largely an unexplored field. The AOR on Pt was found to be highly shape-dependent and sensitive to the crystalline facet orientations, with the (100) facet exceeding the (110) and (111) facets.200–203 An anodic peak corresponding to ammonia oxidation was observed at 0.57 V vs. RHE on a Pt(100) single-crystal electrode, corresponding to the shoulder on polycrystalline Pt, while the AOR onset potentials were higher than 0.6 V and 0.8 V for Pt(111) and Pt(110), respectively, with lower peak current densities.201 As revealed by DFT calculations,193,204 this high activity was attributed to the lower binding energy of N atoms on the bridging sites of the (100) facet, allowing both the O–S mechanism at moderate potentials (≥+0.5 V vs. RHE) and G–M mechanism at low potentials (<+0.5 V) compared with the strong bonding on hollow sites of (110) and (111) facets, where N dimerization was hindered by high activation barriers, leading to poisoning. Herein, it is a plausible method to synthesize Pt nanoparticles with preferential (100) orientations for enhanced AOR activity. Pt nanoparticles prepared by different methods were found to consist of different crystalline facet compositions, with their AOR activities increasing with the ratio of (100) sites.200 Aldaz et al. compared Pt nanoparticles prepared by microemulsion and colloidal methods with different shapes, and the colloidal Pt NPs with a preferential (100) oriented surface showed oxidation current four times than that reduced by N2H4 or NaBH4 in the microemulsion with polyoriented surfaces.203 By controlling the deposition current density during electrodeposition, Pt particles with varying morphologies of nanospheres, nanoflowers and nanosheets could be prepared.205,206 The flower- or sheet-like nanomorphology significantly enhanced the AOR activity of Pt not only by increasing the electrochemical surface area (ECSA), but also improving the intrinsic activity per unit of ECSA. This enhancement may be owing to the rich metastable coordination unsaturated sites, while the sharp tips and edges may serve as “physical catalysts” by concentrating the localized electric field, as is now known. Recently, Ye et al. developed a square-wave potential method to prepare dendritic Pt nanostructures on Pt electrodes as a surface-enhanced infrared absorption platform,207 exhibiting a 10-fold enhancement in IR absorption to study the reaction mechanism, but the catalytic performance was not the focus. More efforts may be needed in tuning the Pt nanomorphology towards improved AOR activity.
Besides the economic concern of high cost, Pt catalysts also suffer from poor electrochemical stability during operation. Due to the strong bonding of N adatoms, the Pt surface is quickly poisoned, and the current quickly drops to only a few percent of its initial current during chronoamperometric electrolysis.189,208 Although several parametric optimization approaches have been proposed, such as applying periodic cathodic pulses to re-hydrogenate the totally deprotonated N back into active NHx species,209 the intrinsic poisoning issue has not been fundamentally solved. The introduction of a secondary alloying component or suitable substrates is a possible approach to improve the resistance to poisoning by tuning the nitrogen surface bonding strength, simultaneously reducing the catalyst cost by decreasing the Pt content in the composites. Typically, Pt alloys with Ir,210–212 Ru, Ni209,213 and Rh214,215 are mostly studied. By alloying with metals binding nitrogen stronger than Pt, the electrochemical hydrazine formation step can be facilitated, attributed to lower onset potentials, while enhanced N bonding energy likely aggravates the poisoning issue, and thus a low content of secondary metal is necessary. Notably, controversy exists where in some reports the alloying effects were not so pronounced or on the contrary led to inferior performance, possibly due to different electrochemical testing conditions and material preparation methods.216,217 Vidal-Iglesias et al. proposed that the negative effect upon the addition of a secondary metal component may be caused by the decrease in the density of Pt(100) surface sites and disruption of the (100) terrace with long-range order. However, Ir, Rh and Ru are noble metals with prices similar to or higher than Pt, and thus alloying with these metals cannot solve the cost problem, while alloying with cheap metals such as Ni or Cu did not show appealing results. Typically, Cu alloying did not improve the AOR performance of Pt catalysts as predicted by DFT calculations, where more complicated factors may be involved.218 Other issues such as OH− blockage effect in alkaline electrolyte,215,219 generation of NOx species at high potentials208,220 and subsequent deactivation221 also impede the practical applications of Pt-based AOR process.


3.2.2. Ni-Based materials for AOR. 
Pt and Pt-based materials have been the most widely studied AOR catalysts in the past half century; however, their commercial utilization is severely limited by the irreconcilable intrinsic drawbacks of Pt including scarcity, high price and quick deactivation. Ni is predicted by DFT calculation to have a promising AOR onset potential of 0.33 V vs. RHE, very close to that of Pt (0.28 V), but the AOR kinetics will be limited by the high energy barrier of 1.39 eV of the N–N coupling hydrazine formation step due to the strong N bonding.194 Ni as a pure metal plate had only limited AOR activity, as shown in early reports by Cheng et al.222 The poor performance was proposed to originate from a spontaneously formed dense nickel oxide layer in contact with electrolytes. NiO, as the major component of nickel oxides, cannot adsorb ammonia molecules by accepting the lone pair electrons on N with its fully occupied outer orbit as Ni metal does, and NiO is a p-type semiconductor with positively charged anion vacancies as main charge carriers, which will preferably adsorb the OH− ions in electrolyte but impede further adsorption from the same positively charged NH4+. Similar results were also reported in an earlier work using RANEY® Ni as an electrode.223 Although pure Ni showed a low performance, it could be activated by potential cycling in alkaline media, forming surface Ni(OH)2 hydroxide layers, which could oxidize ammonia possibly by the chemisorbed oxygen.224 Ammonia oxidation on this Ni/Ni(OH)2 electrode was found to be strongly pH dependent, proceeding mainly at pH above 7, confirming NH3 instead of NH4+ was the reactant to be oxidized. The AOR occurred in the potential range involving the Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox transformation, and a direct electron transfer from ammonia to the Ni(III) NiOOH was proposed following eqn (31). An important feature of this Ni/Ni(OH)2 electrode is that it did not deactivate even at a high ammonia concentration, but the solution turned gray after 12 h electrolysis at 20 mA cm−2, suggesting the corrosion of the electrode. Around 55% of the ammonia was degraded including 11% of which recovered as nitrates after the 12 h electrolysis, possibly from the oxygen transfer reaction by activated H2O molecules (eqn (32)), while no nitrite was detected. These important results suggest a distinct reaction pathway of Ni-based materials compared with Pt, but the related DFT calculation is currently limited. Recently, Ni(OH)2/NiOOH nanoflowers on metallic Ni foam with open porous structures were reported.225 The active oxidized layers with a nanoflowers morphology and 3D pentagonal-shaped pores of 50–250 μm in size were electrochemically formed by potential scanning, and the Ni foam provided a high-conductivity substrate with high surface area, which was also easy to manufacture on a large scale. In 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte at pH 11, the AOR onset potential was around 0.65 V vs. Hg/HgO, and high selectivity of N2 was achieved below 0.79 V, while mainly NO3− was produced at higher potentials. The maximum N2 selectivity of 44.5% was acquired at 0.75 V, which decreased to 21.3% at 0.85 V, while the total NH3-N removal efficiency after 6 h electrolysis increased from 42% to 98% with an increase in potential from 0.7 V to 0.85 V. Although the production of nitrites was detected, it was less significant (<2.5%), most of which oxidized into nitrates at potentials higher than 0.75 V. NiOOH + NH3 → NiOOH(NH3,ads) → NiOOH + 1/2N2 + 3H+ + 3e−(31) NiOOH(NH3,ads) + 3H2O → NO3− + 9H+ + 8e−(32)The introduction of heterogeneity is a commonly used strategy to improve the performance of catalysts. A major defect of Ni-based AOR catalysts is their obvious corrosion problem and generation of oxygenated nitrogen species, leading to lower overall nitrogen removal efficiency. Alloying Ni with a secondary metal component can potentially improve the electrochemical corrosion resistance and N2 selectivity. Allagui et al. introduced Pd as a nucleation agent and prepared Ni nanoparticles 50–100 nm in size via a modified polyol method.226 Pd as a structural directing agent could induce the formation at a trace amount (<2%), although an increase in the Pd ratio resulted in a decrease in the size of Ni nanoparticles formed, and instead of forming alloys, Pd and Ni crystallized in two separate fcc phases with Ni nanoparticles coated with finer Pd nanoparticles. The NixPd1−x catalysts generally behaved similar to pure Ni, and an initial electrochemical scanning treatment was needed to build the electroactive Ni(OH)2 layers. Kapalka et al. proposed that the oxidized NiOOH is the AOR-active phase, where ammonia oxidation occurs via a direct electron transfer reaction between NH3 and NiOOH,224 while due to the overlapping potential range of the AOR and Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox reaction, it is also possible that the AOR proceeded through an indirect pathway, where ammonia was oxidized and NiOOH was reduced into Ni(OH)2. The AOR on these NixPd1−x catalysts was believed to proceed through the direct pathway at low NH3 concentration and the indirect pathway at higher concentrations, where the catalyst surface was saturated by adsorbed ammonia, as evidenced by the change in the current density of the Ni(II)/Ni(III) peak. During chronoamperometric tests, the NixPd1−x catalysts exhibited excellent stability with no deactivation, and a slight increase in current density was observed halfway during the experiment, possibly from the further generation of additional NiOOH active sites under constant oxidizing potentials. Despite the smaller particle sizes at a higher Pd content, the N-rich catalysts exhibited better AOR activity. The synergistic effect between Ni and Cu is an important discovery for Ni-based AOR catalysts. Xu et al. used the electrodeposition method to deposit metallic Ni/Cu bimetal on carbon paper (CP).227 The metal particles of around 100 nm in size were deposited onto the carbon fibers in CP uniformly, but the elemental distribution was not homogeneous, with nickel- or copper-rich areas. The NiCu/CP catalyst exhibited significant AOR activity and stability, reaching a current density of 8.5 mA cm−2 at 0.55 V Ag/AgCl during 2 h chronoamperogram testing, while the single metallic Ni/CP and Cu/CP only delivered negligible currents of 0.8 and 0.4 mA cm−2, respectively. XPS analysis revealed that the bimetallic NiCu catalyst partially transformed into β-Ni(OH)2 and Cu(OH)2 during electrolysis, with the possible formation of NiCu double hydroxides or oxyhydroxides (NixCu1−xOOH). The improved AOR performance of the bimetallic NiCu/CP was attributed to the synergistic effect enhancing both the ECSA and conductivity. Interestingly, when assembled in a two-electrode cell, NiCu/CP exhibited a rapid increase in electrolysis current, reaching 16 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.0 V, twice than that of Pt/C despite the 0.3 V larger onset potential. The addition of Cu to Ni significantly improved the corrosion resistance, as confirmed by the trace amount of Ni and Cu released into the electrolyte after electrolysis compared to the Cu-free case. pH value was found to have an obvious effect on catalytic performance, where a higher pH was beneficial for achieving a higher current density and ammonia removal efficiency; however, with the generation of more oxygenated nitrogen species such as NO3−. During a 16 h testing in 500 ppm NH3, only 10% removal efficiency was achieved at pH = 8, while by increasing the pH to 10, the efficiency increased to 58%. At pH = 12, 14.6% of the nitrogen was recovered as NO3−, while for pH = 10 and 8 the ratios were 7.9% and 6.1%, respectively. A compromise has to be made between high current/efficiency and high N2 selectivity. In a subsequent work, Zhang et al. investigated the effect of the Ni/Cu ratio towards AOR activity, concluding that a 1:1 ratio of Ni:Cu was the optimal composition.228
The active phase of Ni-based catalysts during the AOR is Ni(II) hydroxides, which are in situ oxidized into Ni(III) oxyhydroxides. For metallic Ni-based materials, an initial anodic activation by CV scanning is necessary to generate the catalytic active layers, consuming additional electricity, while the oxidative current density on the as-activated Ni/Ni(OH)2 catalyst was found to increase linearly at low NH3 concentration up to 100 mM but slowed down at higher NH3 concentration, possibly due to saturation of the limited surface active sites by ammonia.224,225 Hence, the straightforward approach of using high-surface-area hydroxides directly instead of metals was developed. NiCu layered hydroxide (LH) nanowires with hierarchical structures were directly grown on carbon fiber cloth (CFC) electrodes via a facile one-step hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 19a and b).229 By varying the Ni/Cu ratio, optimized activity was achieved for Ni0.8Cu0.2 LH. For the as-prepared LHs, an electrochemical activation step was needed before the AOR test to generate NiCu-mixed oxyhydroxides as active sites. A similar AOR onset potential of ∼0.43 V vs. Ag/AgCl was observed for both pure Ni(OH)2 and the optimized Ni0.8Cu0.2 LH, but the current density of the hierarchical Ni0.8Cu0.2 LH increased sharply, reaching 35 mA cm−2 at 0.55 V, seven times that of pure Ni(OH)2 (5 mA cm−2) (Fig. 19c) and about four times that of the commercial Pt/C (∼9 mA cm−2), while pure Cu(OH)2 showed negligible current until potentials higher than 0.7 V. The enhancement in performance by Cu doping could be explained by the increase in active surface sites, as evidenced by the much larger specific capacitance of the Ni0.8Cu0.2 LH (902 F g−1) than pure Ni(OH)2 (280 F g−1). The Ni0.8Cu0.2 LH catalyst showed a high ammonia removal efficiency of 84% (58% for pure Ni(OH)2) in 24 h electrolysis of 50 mM NH4Cl/0.1 M NaOH solution at 0.55 V, with supreme resistance towards N-poisoning and electrodissolution (no Ni2+ or Cu2+ detected in electrolyte after the reaction). The calculated anodic coulombic efficiency towards N2 for the Ni0.8Cu0.2 LH was 62.5% due to the formation of NO3, while NO2 was not detected. Interestingly, the insertion of other transition metals including Co, Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cr into the hydroxide layers did not result in any improvement towards the AOR, but on the contrary reduced the activity of pure Ni(OH)2. These results indicate that the increase in surface active sites cannot be the only reason for the unique ability of Cu to improve the AOR activity of Ni. As predicted by DFT calculations, Cu with rapid N–N coupling kinetics is limited by the weak adsorption of N intermediates, while Ni with strong N bonding suffers from high energy barriers of N–N association.194 Thus, their combination may render a synergistic effect, where N species are adsorbed on the Ni sites and transferred to the Cu sites for N–N bond formation, though a detailed explanation is needed by further investigation.

In summary, Ni-based materials are promising alternative AOR electrocatalysts for Pt. As a non-noble metal, Ni with cheap price can be easily generalized for practical utilization. The severe N-poisoning issue leading to quick deactivation on Pt and other noble metals is not a problem for Ni, and electrochemical corrosion can be prevented by Cu doping. Cu is a unique doping element for Ni, which significantly improves the AOR current density and resistance to electrodissolution owing to the increase in electrochemical surface active sites as well as the synergistic effect between Cu and Ni with different N-bonding strengths. A layered double hydroxide structure is more beneficial for NiCu-mixed catalysts compared with metallic alloys due to the higher density of active sites and homogeneous distribution of Cu in the Ni matrix. During AOR experiments, Ni(III) or NiCu-mixed oxyhydroxides are believed to be the actual active phase, which are in situ generated by anodic electroactivation before the test for both metallic and hydroxide catalysts. Currently, the major limitation of NiCu-based AOR catalysts is the byproduct of nitrates at high potentials due to the oxygen transfer reaction, leading to a decline in both the anodic Faraday efficiency of N2 and total N removal efficiency.

Table 2 lists some state-of-the-art AOR catalysts reported with key criteria for AOR performance. Generally, different electrolyte compositions and reference electrodes were used, making it hard to compare the performance, and hence the establishment of a standard measuring and evaluation procedure is urgently needed for AOR research. Pt-Based catalysts show high Faraday efficiency towards dinitrogen (>90%), but suffer from poor stability and high cost, while Ni-based catalysts generally produce more oxygenated species, possibly due to the participation of surface hydroxide/oxyhydroxide during the reaction. Although some other materials have been examined for the AOR, the related results are rather limited. Metals beyond Pt and Ni either are totally inactive due a to large onset potential or quickly deactivated during operation, giving only a transient current. Currently, Pt-based and Ni-based materials are still the two major categories of AOR catalysts. Nevertheless, a variety of materials are still not evaluated, especially transition metal oxides/sulfides/phosphides/carbides, which have shown promising applications in other electrochemical oxidation processes. Thus, the development of new catalyst families and novel nanostructures should be the future focus in AOR research.

4. Electrochemical hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR)
Hydrazine (N2H4) can be regarded as an intermediate between elemental N2 and NH3. Adsorbed hydrazine-like species can be formed during either the NRR following an alternative associative pathway or AOR following the Gerischer–Mauerer mechanism, but the desorption of hydrazine from catalyst surface is mostly a very endergonic step, resulting in no hydrazine production during electrochemical nitrogen transformation processes. Recently, hydrazine formation was observed during nitrogen electroreduction by THH Au NRs as mentioned above in alkaline solution.79 Although only a few reports of hydrazine formation during electrolysis have been found to date, it is reasonable to expect possible electrochemical hydrazine synthesis in the future. As a strong reducing agent, the oxidation of hydrazine is the case in most applications. Hydrazine is widely used as high-energy fuel, especially in the aerospace industry, as well as a potential liquid-phase hydrogen carrier with its high hydrogen content (12.6 wt%). Although its hydrogen content is slightly lower than that of ammonia (17.8 wt%), hydrazine is much more active than ammonia both thermodynamically and kinetically. From the Pourbaix diagram in Fig. 3, the potential of hydrazine oxidation is much lower than that of ammonia and even hydrogen, especially in alkaline solution (−0.332 V vs. RHE), indicating the stronger reducibility of hydrazine. As a result, hydrazine oxidation, when coupled with the ORR to assemble a direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHFC) can deliver a higher cell voltage (1.562 V in theory) than an ammonia-based cell (1.138 V). Additionally, for hydrogen generation, electrochemical hydrazine decomposition is even a spontaneous process, providing a theoretical cell voltage of +0.332 V. Although in reality, an externally applied potential is still needed to drive hydrazine dehydrogenation due to kinetic overpotentials on both electrodes, the total cell voltage required will still be much less than the 1.23 V for water splitting. From a kinetic point of view, the HzOR can be regarded as part of the Gerischer–Mauerer AOR process. However, the major difference with the AOR is the non-electrochemical N–N bonding step, which is mostly the rate-determining step of the AOR, is not needed in the HzOR. Consequently, all the steps involved in the HzOR are electrochemical steps, and thus can be well-tuned by applied potentials, greatly expanding the possible candidates of catalysts compared with those for the AOR.
4.1. Electrocatalysts for the HzOR
The available electrocatalysts for the HzOR are much richer than the AOR with the absence of a rate-limiting chemical N–N associating step. HzOR catalysts generally fall into three categories, precious metal-based materials, non-precious metal-based materials and carbon materials. In terms of metals chosen, the HzOR is very similar to the AOR, but without the limitation of the N–N coupling step, the performance of HzOR electrocatalysts would fit better into the volcano plot with N bonding strength. Similar problems of N poisoning and oxynitrides formation in the AOR should also be considered in the design of HzOR electrocatalysts.

4.1.1. Precious metal catalysts. 
Noble-metal catalysts for the HzOR include Pd, Pt, Au, Ag and their alloys and composites.
Pd with a theoretically suited N adsorption energy is inactive towards the AOR due to the sluggish N–N bonding step. In the case of the HzOR where N–N bonding is not needed, Pd is proven to be a highly efficient catalyst. The shape and size of Pd nanoparticles greatly influence the catalytic performance. Liang et al. synthesized highly dispersed and ultrafine carbon supported Pd nanoparticles (Pd/C–E).230 Using the NaBH4 reduction method without the presence of macromolecular polymer ligands, a “clean” polymer-free nanoparticle surface could be obtained with an average diameter of 2.9 nm, smaller than that in Pd/C–N prepared via the conventional liquid phase reduction method. Although the onset potential of the HzOR of both Pd/C–E and Pd/C–N is located at −0.05 V vs. SCE, Pd/C–E possessed a lower peak potential and a higher peak current under the strong acidic condition, suggesting a better electrocatalytic performance due to the smaller particle size and more uniform size dispersion. Considering that the strong acidic solution of hydrazine is stable to air oxidation and autodecomposition, this type of Pd/C–E has potential to be applied in the acidic direct hydrazine fuel cells.
In view of economic concerns, alloying Pd with early transition metals can reduce the Pd content in the catalysts, and thus reduce the cost. Additionally, the geometric and electronic structures of Pd can be further modified, thus improving the electrocatalytic performance and stability. A Pd–Co–P ternary alloy network was synthesized via a one-step cyanogel-reduction method.231 The introduction of P atoms into the Pd–Co matrix could effectively tune the electronic structures of the Pd–Co bimetallic alloy, and this ternary alloy had smaller particle sizes compared to that of binary Pd–Co particles as a result of the electrostatic repulsion between the surficial phosphonic acid groups. The mass normalized CV curves showed that the anodic oxidation peak current of Pd–Co–P was higher than that of Pd–Co, which originated from the larger ECSA of Pd–Co–P and lower Pd loading, as well as the electrostatic attraction between N2H5+ and negatively charged phosphonic acid groups. Consequently, Pd–Co–P exhibited significantly higher electrocatalytic activity (mass activity: 758.1 A gPd−1 and specific peak current density: 27.6 A mPd−2) and stability than the commercial Pd black.
Pt is the state-of-the-art catalyst for the AOR, and also an effective catalyst for the HzOR. However, the similar problems of high price and poisoning also exist in the case of the HzOR. Immobilization of metal nanoparticles onto insoluble supports is a conventional approach to improve the electrocatalytic performance. Graphene has a large surface area, high mechanical strength, good electrical conductivity, and durability under harsh conditions. Thus, by depositing Pt nanoparticles onto amidated graphene oxides, the catalytic activity and stability could be greatly enhanced due to the metal-carbon interaction.232 The strong interaction between Pt nanoparticles and the amine groups in amidated GO resulted in a small Pt particle size, excellent particle dispersion, and improved ECSA. The obtained GO–Pt showed an onset potential of 0.14 V vs. RHE and the oxidation current only decreased by 3.3% after 600 cycles. From the XPS result, it was determined that the formation of oxygen-containing Pt species (PtOads, PtO, PtO2, etc.) may block the active sites, leading to a current decay. In addition to amidated graphene, nitrogen-graphene233 and polyaniline234 can also be applied as supports for Pt nanoparticles to improve the activity and stability of catalysts.
Unlike the case of the AOR, Au shows certain potential as an HzOR catalyst. Thus, combining 2D materials as substrates with Au nanoparticles is a feasible approach to improve the catalytic performance. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a layered material analogous to graphite but more difficult to exfoliate. Using tip-sonication method, h-BN nanosheets (BNNS) with abundant hydroxyl groups could be exfoliated, and Au nanoparticles with an average diameter of 17 nm without aggregation could grow in situ on these nanosheets without any additional reductant.235 From the CV curves in the presence of hydrazine, BNNS–Au NPs exhibited a higher current response and lower overpotential compared with BNNS and Au NPs. The advanced performance could be ascribed to the large surface area and uniform distribution of Au NPs, providing better electron transfer performance. Interestingly, MOFs possess a large surface area, high porosity, and tunable structures, which make them suitable as matrices for a variety of small molecules and metal nanoparticles. When Au was supported on NH2-MIL-125(Ti), the obtained composites exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance towards the HzOR.236 At pH = 7.0, a large anodic current appeared for Au/NH2-MIL-125(Ti) with an onset potential of around −0.034 V vs. Ag/AgCl. N2H4 is a toxic material and has carcinogenic and hepatotoxic effects on human beings. Considering the excellent activity of Au/NH2-MIL-125(Ti), a facile electrochemical sensor for hydrazine detection was constructed. The sensor could operate in a wide linear range of 10 nM to 100 μM and a low detection limit of 0.5 nM. Compared to other detection methods, the proposed electrochemical sensor method possessed high sensitivity, fast response, wide linear range, and satisfactory detection limit.
In view of the high price of Pt, Pd, and Au, the relatively cheap Ag catalyst can be an alternative for the HzOR. By modifying Ag nanoparticles with benzyl mercaptan molecules, highly monodispersed Ag nanoparticles on multi-walled CNTs (Ag/CNTs) were prepared.237 A typical current peak of around 0.42 V vs. SCE appeared when hydrazine was added to the electrolyte. The peak anodic currents were proportional to the square root of the scan rates, indicating the oxidation process was controlled by diffusion.


4.1.2. Non-precious metal catalysts. 
Transition metals/alloys. 
Many non-noble metals, especially Ni, Co, Cu and their alloys, can electrically catalyze hydrazine to N2 and H2O through a four-electron transfer process. Various Ni-based catalysts have been investigated for the HzOR. However, their performances were limited largely by the high oxidation states of the metal species due to their intrinsically high oxophilicity. The formation of metal oxides during the conventional synthesis process is inevitable. Jeon et al. reported the fabrication of highly metallic Ni nanoparticles covered by carbon shells under a mixed gas of N2 and H2.238 Heat treatments were also performed under pure N2 and synthetic air. Different heat treatment atmospheres resulted in different contents of metallic Ni, which played a decisive role in the catalytic activity. The atomic percentage of Ni0 was about 71.7% after N2/H2 mixture heat treatment, and it exhibited 2.4 times higher mass-specific activity (608 A gNi−1 at 0.1 V vs. RHE) than that of the low Ni0 content catalyst. The results indicated that the content of metallic Ni played a decisive role in the catalytic activities and the thin carbon shell was effective in protecting the metallic Ni from further oxidation in air. Atomically thick ultrathin 2D metal nanocrystals have a dramatically increased surface/volume ratio and unique electronic structures. An ultrathin Ni nanosheet array (Ni-NSA) with a single-crystalline lamellar structure of only 10 atomic layers in thickness and an exposed (111) facet was applied for the HzOR.239 This 3D open porous array structure possessed a lower onset potential than Pt/C, and afforded a specific activity of 227.6 mA cm−2 and mass activity of 406.4 mA mg−1 at 0.25 V vs. RHE. Ni-NSA also exhibited superaerophobic surfaces, facilitating the mass transfer and gas release. In addition, no structural damage was observed after a 10000 s stability test in a highly concentrated N2H4 solution.
When alloying Ni with other transition metals, the electronic structure of Ni can be modified, thus enhancing the catalytic performance. In addition, the shape, composition, and size of alloy nanocrystals also affect the overall catalytic activity. Therefore, the architectural control of Ni-based alloys with well-defined shapes can be an effective approach to improve their HzOR performance. Amorphous NiCo pompoms were fabricated through a liquid–liquid interface-mediated method.240 The two-phase interface played an important role in the formation of Ni1Co3 pompoms. Compared with the single-component Ni or Co catalyst, Ni1Co3 showed a more negative onset potential and higher peak current as well as good stability. The excellent catalytic performance was ascribed to the liquid-phase electrochemical promotion effect of a chemical catalytic reaction (EPOC) and large BET surface area. Another highly active Ni–Co alloy electrocatalyst with a composition of Ni60Co40 presented a 6-fold increase in HzOR activity over the present benchmark catalysts.241 The oxidation peak at 0.23 V and onset potential of −0.15 V of Ni60Co40 were significantly shifted to lower electrode potentials, offering high efficiencies. Ni–Zn alloy nanosheets arrayed on Ni foams with an open-nano-wall network structure and robust adhesion were prepared using an electrodeposition process, showing a current density of 300 mA cm−2 at 0.40 V and an onset potential of −0.15 V vs. RHE in the hydrazine oxidation process.242 The addition of Zn reduced the nanocrystallite size of Ni, and a low reaction resistance was observed on the Ni–Zn alloy. DFT calculations suggested that the binding energy of hydrazine to Ni in the presence of Zn was much lower than that of monometallic Ni. The XPS results indicated that Zn acted as an electron donor, increasing the electron density of Ni. Consequently, the electron back-donation from Ni to the antibonding orbital of N2H4 was enhanced, leading to a weaker interaction between Ni and N2H4 and a weaker N–H bond, and thus hydrazine could be easily oxidized.
Cu is a potential low-cost and stable catalyst for the HzOR. Three-dimensional thorn-like Cu nanowire arrays fabricated via the electrochemical nano-engineering method showed an onset potential of around −0.82 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and the current density even exceeded that of Pt/C at −0.665 V.243 The aligned nanowire structure had well-defined charge transport paths along the axial direction and shortened mass diffusion length resulting from the open space within the arrays. Compared with the catalyst obtained via the traditional wet-chemical method, this approach avoided the undesirable aggregates and disrupted morphology, leading to the expose of more electrochemically active sites. In addition, with direct preparation on the current collector, the typical drawbacks in the application of polymer binders for building electrodes such as flaking-off active materials and blocking of active sites could be favorably avoided.
Although Cu is a potential low-cost and stable catalyst for the HzOR, it is normally not as active as noble and other transition metals. On the other hand, Ni is a highly effective catalyst for the HzOR but with relatively weak stability. By virtue of the stable property of Cu and high activity of Ni, the combination of Cu and Ni to form a Ni–Cu alloy can potentially improve both the activity and stability of the catalyst. A superaerophobic 3D porous flower-like Ni–Cu alloy film fabricated via a one-step electrodeposition process was used as the anode catalyst for the HzOR in alkaline media.244 This Ni–Cu alloy film showed a significantly boosted current density (300 mA cm−2 at −0.6 V vs. SCE) and stability (a current density retention of 80% after 5000 s) compared with other Cu or Ni catalysts under moderate conditions. This alloying treatment alleviated the intrinsic easy run-off property of Ni, fixing the Ni active sites by Cu atoms. In addition, this alloy film exhibited a negligible adhesion response to the produced gas bubbles. The generated gas bubbles left quickly before they grew larger than 20 μm on the underwater superaerophobic surface, which was crucial to promote the gas evolution behavior. In general, the enhanced specific surface area, accessible active sites and mass diffusion pathways in this highly porous structure, as well as the binary component and superaerophobic surface contributed to the superior activity.
Transition metal oxides/hydroxides. 
Transition metals in their oxide/hydroxide forms have also been investigated for the HzOR. As a chemical sensor for hydrazine detection, CuO shows promising potential for the HzOR. The transformation between different oxidation states of Cu(II) and Cu(I) could act as mediators to shuttle electrons between hydrazine and the catalysts, and thus enhance the activity and the durability of the catalyst. In addition, using various synthetic methods, well-defined CuO nanostructures with different morphologies can be obtained, which contribute to the overall performance of catalysts. Ultrathin willow-like CuO nanoflakes showed a low onset potential of −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl and a high oxidation peak current of 0.9 mA at 0.3 V.245 CuO morphologies (spiny and flower-shaped) with different exposed facets were synthesized in a two-phase solution.246 Electrochemical results indicated that the increased growth of the (111) facet was strongly correlated with enhanced performance, with an onset potential of −0.14 V vs. Ag/AgCl and a high peak current density of 5.23 mA cm−2 for the CuO nanoflowers with mostly grown (111) facets. The formation of aggregates and big size particles may occur during the preparation of transition metal oxides. Electrospinning is a good choice for the preparation of uniform dispersion nanoparticles. By loading metal salts within polymer fibers and exerting subsequent thermal treatment, uniformly dispersed nanoparticles attached on nanofibers can be obtained. CuO/NiO composite NFs were produced from the pyrolysis of electrospun nanofibers.247 A good availability of active sites, high surface area, the synergistic effect between Cu and Ni, as well as low Rct all contributed to the enhanced performance.
Metal oxides generally have low electro-conductivity. Thus, coupling with advanced carbon materials with high conductivity such as graphene, graphene oxides (GO), and carbon nanotubes is a feasible approach to improve the conductivity and catalytic performance of these materials. In view of the amphiphilic property of GO, various types of nanostructures such as metal nanoparticles, metal oxides, and polymers can be dispersed on GO. The in situ reduction of GO-containing metal precursors has been widely used to fabricate graphene-based metal oxide nanocomposites. CeO2 is a rare earth material with good gas transfer ability and size-dependent catalytic properties. When reduced GO (rGO) was used as a substrate to support CeO2, CeO2 nanoparticles with an average size of 14 nm were uniformly dispersed.248 By combining the advantages of rGO and CeO2 with their good conductivity and electrocatalytic activity, the composite showed excellent catalytic activity for the HzOR compared to bare CeO2. The CeO2 nanoparticles with high oxygen transfer ability acted as electron mediators and the rGO sheets enhanced the electron transfer process. Besides, the high concentration of oxygen vacancies in CeO2–rGO provided better catalytic properties. ZnO is widely researched as a wide-band-gap semiconductor with unique electronic properties. By controlling the additives, different ZnO structures were directly electrodeposited on single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films, which provided a conductive substrate and a fast electron transfer path.249 The best electrocatalytic character and fast electron transfer behavior were realized on ZnO nanorods due to their high aspect ratio and high surface coverage, where an oxidation peak was observed at 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl with high current density. In addition, the ZnO nanorod/SWCNT composite could serve as an excellent hydrazine sensor with a hydrazine detection limit of 0.17 μM and sensitivity of 0.10 μA μM−1 cm−2. However, the rod morphology turned into tubular structures after long-time electrolysis, which was attributed to the H+ ions produced during the hydrazine oxidation process.
In comparison to single-metal catalysts, bimetallic composite hydroxides show higher electrocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the intrinsically low conductivity of hydroxides will hinder the electron transfer to the active sites from the substrate. Partial reduction of hydroxides can result in metal-modified hydroxides composites, which can further facilitate the electron transfer. NiFe hydroxide nanosheets modified with metal Ni were in situ grown on Ni foams via electrodeposition. This in situ growth method could avoid the insulative polymer binders, and the intrinsic low conductivity of hydroxides could be enhanced by conductive Ni metal nanoparticles and substrates. The composites exhibited a small onset potential of −0.015 V vs. RHE and a high current density of 157 mA cm−2 at 0.2 V.250
Transition metal phosphides and chalcogenides. 
Transition metal phosphides and chalcogenides, similar to their metallic and oxide counterparts, have shown potential as HzOR catalysts due to their high conductivity and modified electric properties.
Phosphides are known as highly active materials for various electrocatalytic processes. Ni2P nanoarrays in situ grown on Ni foam (Ni2P/NF) showed superior catalytic activity and durability towards the HzOR.251 Ni2P/NF only demanded −25 mV to drive a current density of 50 mA cm−2, which was even lower than that of Pt/C on NF. When operated at a constant current density of 100 mA cm−2 for 10 h, the potential of Ni2P/NF only increased 15 mV. The low Tafel slope (55 mV dec−1), high electrochemically active surface areas and low Rct facilitated the catalytic kinetics and exposure of active sites. CoP as an interstitial alloy has good electrical conductivity. Without hydrazine, a CoP nanoarray on Ti mesh (CoP/TiM) exhibited an onset potential of 1.55 V, while the onset potential of −0.05 V could be achieved with the addition of hydrazine. In addition, it only needed −6 mV to achieve 100 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH with 100 mM hydrazine. A 10000 cycle long-term electrolysis further verified the stability of CoP/TiM towards the HzOR.252
Chalcogenides such as sulfides and selenides have higher conductivity than their oxide counterparts, as well as unique electron structures. Hierarchical CoNi–metal–sulfide core–shell nanoarrays (CoNi–R–S) were obtained from vertically aligned CoNi-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet arrays on Ni foil as a precursor, followed by subsequent reduction in an H2 atmosphere and vulcanization.253 In the hydrazine oxidation process, CoNi–R–S exhibited a peak oxidation current of 9.64 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V vs. RHE, low Tafel slope of 67 mV dec−1 and large TOF value of 0.00293 s−1. A synergistic effect was demonstrated that the CoNi core with high conductivity facilitated the electron transfer, while the CoNi–sulfide shell exposed active sites for the HzOR. Moreover, the hierarchical structure was beneficial for the mass diffusion. According to the DFT calculations, CoNi–sulfide exhibited semiconductor property with discontinuous energy bands. Nevertheless, its bandgap was small, suggesting a good electron transfer ability. Besides, the charge density of Ni was low, which could facilitate the adsorption of N2H4. Investigating the stepwise dehydrogenation process of hydrazine, it was discovered that a thermodynamically favorable exothermic process occurred on this CoNi–sulfide. Ni3Se4 nanorod arrays were fabricated through a hydrothermal selenization method.254 Benefiting from the unique nanorod array structure and the intrinsic properties of the formed metal–selenium bonds, by substituting the OER with the HzOR, the anodic potential could be reduced from 1.47 V to 0.32 V vs. RHE to afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Another 3D nanoporous Ni–Co perselenide nanorod array (Ni0.5Co0.5Se2) was prepared by initial electrodeposition and subsequent selenization process,255 which delivered a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a pretty low potential of −62 mV vs. RHE. According to the DFT results, the appropriate affinity to the intermediates at Ni0.5Co0.5Se2 during the HzOR, which was caused by the down shift of the interfacial Ni 3d orbital, endowed it with high catalytic activity.


4.1.3. Carbon-based catalysts. 
Porous carbon-based materials have been intensively explored as electrocatalysts due to their high surface area, high pore volume and potential application as support materials. Although metal-based catalysts may suffer from dissolution, sintering, agglomeration and poisoning, carbon-based electrodes show much more enhanced stability especially in the low-oxidative-potential range of the HzOR. Meanwhile, the electrocatalytic properties of carbon-based systems can be easily enhanced by doping with heteroatoms such as N, B, P, and S. Silica is often used as a template, which can produce carbon materials with high porosity. Considering this advantage, filter paper cellulose material was used as a precursor and its porous matrix was used to deposit silica shells. After carbonization and removal of the silica, N-doped carbon was obtained, which exhibited an onset potential and peak potential at −0.3 V and 0.1 V vs. SCE, respectively.256 Meng et al. fabricated polypyrrole-derived N and O co-doped mesoporous carbons (PPY-NOMPCs) via the polymerization of pyrrole within the channels of SBA-15, followed by carbonization and subsequent removal of the templates.257 The sharp peak at 0.65° in the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) pattern indicated the presence of ordered mesostructures. The resultant PPY-NOMPC pyrolyzed at 900 °C displayed an onset potential of −0.36 V and peak potential of −0.06 V vs. SCE towards the HzOR. The origin of such high performance was attributed to the high density of N and O dopants and dopant-related structural defects, which aided the effective adsorption of hydrazine on the catalytic surfaces, as well as the large surface area benefiting mass transportation. A fine balance between the defects and the degree of graphitization was essential for achieving high activity.
The use of biomass, which is relatively inexpensive, abundant, and renewable, to construct carbon-based catalysts is attractive due to the sustainability challenges. Using ionic liquid-modified cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs) as precursors, heteroatom (N and S)-doped nanostructured carbon catalysts could be produced.258 The outstanding catalytic activity for the HzOR was attributed to the heteroatom dopants and defects within CNWs. However, the activity depended not on the total density of dopants, but on the specific type of dopant and defects contained in the materials. More interestingly, yeast cells could be thermally transformed into hollow, core–shell heteroatom-doped carbon microparticles, which could effectively catalyze the HzOR.259 Besides, N,O-codoped mesoporous carbon derived from milled rice and colloidal silica performed well in the HzOR with a small onset potential and high peak current density.260

4.2. Applications

4.2.1. Full hydrogen generation electrolytic system. 
Hydrogen has been regarded as ideal clean and sustainable energy to replace the conventional fossil fuels and alleviate the environmental problems. As discussed above, the thermodynamically more favorable HzOR can be adopted to replace the sluggish OER process to reduce the energy consumption and accelerate the hydrogen production process.
As stated in the previous section, Ni2P/NF has superior performance for the HzOR. When applied as an HER catalyst, it also showed high catalytic activity.251 Thus, a two-electrode electrolyzer using Ni2P/NF as the cathode and anode was built, which only needed a cell voltage of 1.0 V to afford a current density of 500 mA cm−2. Additionally, a cell voltage of 0.45 V was required to achieve 100 mA cm−2 and remained stable for 10 h. Contrarily, without the presence of hydrazine, this system required a high cell voltage of 1.6 V to deliver 20 mA cm−2 current density to drive the water splitting process. Ultrathin Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays with 9–14 nm nanosheet thickness grown on Ni foam (Ni3S2/NF) were fabricated via the in situ vapor-phase hydrothermal (VPH) transformation of the Ni(OH)2/NF precursor.261 Ni3S2/NF-2, which underwent the VPH process for 2 h, displayed a superior performance for both the HER and HzOR with onset potentials of −0.05 and 0.10 V vs. RHE, respectively. In addition, a small potential of 0.415 V was needed to afford a current density of 100 mA cm−2 in the HzOR. The high HER and HzOR activity make Ni3S2/NF-2 promising for easy H2 generation. The fabricated two-electrode system delivered 100 mA cm−2 at 0.867 V, while the voltage was 2.01 V to achieve the same current density without the addition of hydrazine. DFT calculations indicated that the adsorption energy of N2H4 on the Ni3S2(110) surface was much higher than that of H2O, forming a stronger interaction between N2H4 and Ni3S2. As a result, N2H4 first occupies the surface and facilitates H2 production. Bifunctional NiS2 nanosheet arrays on Ti mesh (NiS2/TiM) needed a cell voltage of 0.59 V to attain 50 mA cm−2 for hydrazine splitting, which was 1.34 V less than that of pure water splitting to achieve the same current density.262
A tubular CoSe2 nanosheet electrode grown on Ni foam substrate had a uniform diameter of about 250 nm.263 This hierarchical nanosheet structure with an interconnected configuration facilitated the exposure of active sites, interfacial contact with the electrolyte, mass transport and gas diffusion. It could work as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, exhibiting 10 mA cm−2 at −84 mV for the HER and −17 mV for the HzOR. When constructing an electrolyzer using this electrode as both the cathode and anode, only 164 mV was required to achieve 10 mA cm−2 for 14 h stable hydrogen production. DFT calculations revealed that the Co site was favorable for H2O adsorption, while the Se site helped the transformation of Hads to H2. Consequently, the intrinsic electrocatalytic HER activity of CoSe2 and outstanding HzOR performance both contributed to the energy-efficient hydrogen production.


4.2.2. Direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHFC). 
N2H4 as a high-energy fuel molecule has been studied as early as 1912. Later, Evans and Kordesch first suggested the concept of the direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHFC) in the 1960s, which has attracted much attention.264 The DHFC has unique advantages as follows: (i) it can offer high energy and power densities compared to hydrogen fuel cells; (ii) it can operate at relatively low temperatures (40–80 °C); (iii) the oxidation products are harmless with zero CO2 emission; and (iv) the high theoretical cell potential of 1.56 V is superior to hydrogen fuel cells. Therefore, designing electrocatalysts with excellent catalytic performance for the HzOR and fabricating DHFCs are highly desirable. The cell reactions are shown below. Cathode: O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH− E0 = 1.23 V vs. RHE(33) Anode: N2H4 + 4OH− → N2 + 4H2O + 4e− E0 = −0.33 V vs. RHE(34) Cell reaction: N2H4 + O2 → N2 + 2H2O E0 = 1.56 V vs. RHE(35)By controlling the pore size distribution with PMMA and water-vapor treatments, electrospun tree-bark-shaped metal-free N-doped carbon (NDC) with a meso/macroporous structure (>10 nm) was obtained. Its onset potential for the HzOR was −0.57 V vs. Hg/HgO, and it exhibited the highest power performance of 127.5 mW cm−2 in an actual fuel cell system.265 A series of characterization results demonstrated that the N-doped sites exposed through meso/macropores predominantly served as the active sites in the DHFC.
Serov et al. reported the synthesis of novel NiZn catalysts via a solvent-free method, which was scalable to hundreds of kilograms and considered a “green” synthetic method. The catalysts possessed an onset potential of −0.14 V vs. RHE for the HzOR and a remarkable peak activity of 16000 A gNiZn−1. In the membrane electrode assembly tests, the peak current density of 450 mW cm−2 was obtained. This material was also implemented in a fuel stack for a new-generation hydrazine-fueled vehicle, which was presented in 2013 at the 43rd Tokyo Motor Show.266 The Ni–La binary system containing intermetallic crystal structures was shown to improve the HzOR efficiently through alloying effects. The best performing Ni0.9La0.1/C possessed an onset potential of −0.0464 V vs. RHE, and mass activity of 759.5 A gcat−1 at 0.221 V. The cell performance of DHFC using Ni0.9La0.1 as an anode exhibited an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.751 V and maximum power density of 453 mW cm−2. High voltage electron microscopy (HVEM) showed that Ni0.9La0.1 was composed of an hcp-LaNi5 shell coating an fcc-Ni core. It was supposed that LaNi5 contributed to break the N–H bond after hydrazine was adsorbed on the catalyst surface, and directly oxidized hydrazine.267 In addition, the binary Ni0.8Zn0.2 catalyst was used as an anode catalyst in a DHFC, and the OCV was observed as 0.777 V, with the maximum power density of 486 mW cm−2.268
To pursue better performances of DHFCs, much progress has been made to explore various catalysts suitable for the HzOR in order to lower the operating overpotentials and enhance the energy conversion efficiency. However, the way for solving the gas adhesion problem on the electrode surfaces, which may hinder the mass transport to the catalyst sites, has received little attention. This problem is actually of extreme importance because at high reaction rates, gas bubbles will accumulate on the electrode surface, which may not only hinder the fuel transport to the catalyst sites, but also impose a high pressure on the electrode. By designing the surface architecture of electrodes, the adhesion behavior of gas bubbles can be flexibly tuned. Lu et al. directly constructed a 3D nanostructured Cu film (Cu film/Cu foil) to obtain a superaerophobic surface, forming a discontinuous three-phase contact line.269 This film realized a small gas releasing size and fast removal of N2 bubbles at high reaction rates. The HzOR performance of the Cu film/Cu foil was boosted, which had an 8.8 times higher current density at −0.6 V than Cu foil. Growing the Cu film on Cu foam could further enhance the HzOR performance. When testing a DHFC assembled using the Cu film/Cu foam with Pt/C as the anode and cathode, the open-circuit potential of the cell was 1 V, with a maximum power density of 160.8 mW cm−2. This nanostructure engineering strategy maximizes the real electrode working area as well as solving the gas adhesion problem, and may prove to be effective for other gas evolution reactions.
Recently, Liu et al. developed a hydrazine-based self-supporting hydrogen generation system using Fe-doped CoS2 nanosheet (Fe–CoS2) electrocatalysts.270 The obtained Fe–CoS2 showed obviously enhanced HER activity with a potential of −40 mV vs. RHE to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 20a). In addition, it also exhibited an excellent HzOR performance, delivering a current density of 100 mA cm−2 at a potential of 129 mV (Fig. 20b). Encouraged by the high activities and stabilities of Fe–CoS2 towards the HER and HzOR, the application of overall hydrazine splitting was investigated. This electrolyzer required a cell voltage of 0.95 V to achieve 500 mA cm−2 (Fig. 20c and d). Then, Fe–CoS2 was used as the anode in a DHFC, where the cathode was made of Pt/C, and O2 was reduced to H2O (Fig. 20e and f). The OCV value was 1.03 V, with a maximum power density of 125 mW cm−2. Afterwards, the DHFC and the hydrazine splitting unit were integrated to form a self-powered H2 production system with hydrazine as the sole consumable (Fig. 20g). This system offered an H2 evolution rate of 9.95 mmol h−1, a faradaic efficiency of 98% and 20 h stability. DFT calculations ascribed the excellent performance to the fact that Fe doping in CoS2 decreased the free-energy changes of H adsorption and *NH2NH2 dehydrogenation on CoS2 (Fig. 20h and i).

Table 3 lists some representative HzOR catalysts and their testing conditions and key parameters. Compared with the AOR, the available library of catalyst candidates is much richer for the HzOR, including noble metals, non-noble transition metals and their compounds, carbon materials and their composites, while the testing procedures are relatively more standardized. The HzOR reaction on most reported cathodes can initiate at around or below 0 V vs. RHE, saving a significant amount of energy for hydrogen production, making it a promising alternative for on-site hydrogen generation compared with overall water splitting. On the other hand, a similar onset potential with the HOR means that DHzFCs can compete with hydrogen FCs with only a slightly lower cell voltage, but much easier fuel storage and transportation. With suitable catalysts, the HzOR may replace the OER in the future for many practical applications, but still the highly poisonous nature of hydrazine is a serious issue requiring careful treatment and establishment of a set of complete infrastructure and emergency plans in case of leakage.

5. Concluding perspectives: establishing a future carbon-free and self-sustainable nitrogen economy
A century of industrial ammonia synthesis has literally “changed the world” on both the positive and negative sides. While contributing to the prosperity of our modern industry society, the rapidly growing anthropogenic nitrogen fixation has severely unbalanced the global natural nitrogen cycling, inducing numerous unexpected environmental side effects including decline in the quality of surface and ground water, especially drinking water, destruction of coastal and aquatic ecosystems, air pollution and soil acidification, in addition to many other consequences with negative effects on humans and the environment. Electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation and transformation, as we have discussed throughout this article, is a promising solution to meet the ever-growing demand of ammonia as well as restore the global nitrogen balance. Since no progress has been achieved in direct oxidative nitrogen fixation, we focused on the lower branch of the nitrogen cycle involving dinitrogen (N2) and reduced nitrogen species such as ammonia (NH3) and hydrazine (N2H4). Three important electrochemical processes between these species have been comprehensively discussed herein, which are the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), trying to establish a general picture of the whole nitrogen cycling system instead of limited to a certain reaction, with their respective aspects concluded as follows.
Electrochemical NRR as a potential method for ammonia synthesis has been studied for about 50 years; however, with little progress until the new century, especially very recently since 2017 with the blooming of NRR related experimental reports. The great progress in the last two years boosting both ammonia yield rate and coulombic selectivity an order of magnitude higher should be attributed to the rich knowledge accumulated in both electrocatalysis and nanomaterials, guidance of theoretical calculation, and revolution in characterization equipment and techniques, especially in situ and operando techniques. A clear path can be seen in the development of electrochemical NRR systems, where reaction conditions from high temperature/pressure to room temperature and ambient pressure; reacting systems from gas-phase/solid electrolyte to organic electrolyte to aqueous systems; feedstock from N2/H2 to N2/H2O; and catalysts from bulky materials to nanostructured materials. The ultimate goal of NRR research is to achieve efficient and rapid ammonia production under benign conditions similar to that of biological nitrogen fixation, and for this purpose, future research should focus on low temperature/pressure nitrogen reduction in aqueous solutions using noble-metal-free electrocatalysts despite the difficulty. Although recent studies have given some encouraging results, the catalyst system for the NRR is far from systematic, missing a benchmark catalyst, such as Pt for the HER, HOR and ORR. Theoretical calculations are essential for NRR catalyst design compared to other fields of electrocatalysts. Unlike thermal-driven ammonia synthesis, where a dissociative pathway dominates, the NRR in aqueous media is generally believed to proceed via an associative pathway with the successive transfer of proton and electron pairs in either distal, alternative or mixed ways. DFT predictions seem to be against the utilization of pure metal and alloy catalysts since most of the common metals would either preferably produce hydrogen, show large overpotentials, or get poisoned by aqueous oxygen. The theoretically favored Mo, Ru and Rh show poor Faraday efficiency towards ammonia experimentally, while metals with very poor HER activity such as Au contrarily performed much better. Thus, combining metals with other functional materials may be a feasible approach, especially the construction of Mott–Schottky-type heterostructures or atomic-level dispersion of metal sites. Transition metal nitrides are predicted to possess great potential towards the NRR via a unique MvK reaction mechanism, but only VN and MoNx have been experimentally investigated to date. In the case of other transition metal compounds such as oxides, sulfides, phosphides and carbides, related works are rather scarce, and even extensive DFT predictions as the case for transition metals and metal nitrides are absent, leaving much room for future development. Doped carbon seems to be a promising candidate in the current view, but its NRR initiation potential is generally much more negative compared with metal-containing catalysts, leading to a higher energy cost.
In addition to ammonia production, one rarely mentioned topic is the recovery of as-produced ammonia after the reaction. In an aqueous system, ammonia mostly dissolves in the electrolyte, and the final product is actually in the form of an aqueous solution with a low ammonia concentration. Since electrochemical NRR is originally proposed for distributed POU applications, such as on-site ammonia generation for fertilization in farms in remote areas, which requires a low-concentration but continuous ammonia flow, it may not be necessary to separate ammonia from the NRR downstream, which can be directly used as liquid fertilizer, but toxic or harmful chemicals including strong acids/bases, organics, ionic liquids and hydrazine should be avoided. Potassium-based phosphate buffer saline (PBS) may be considered a feasible electrolyte since the neutral PBS environment has been previously proven to suppress the HER and enhance the NH3 Faraday efficiency, and all three elements of K, P and N are essential nutrients for plant growth, making it possible to directly use the NRR product mixture as a mixed N–P–K liquid fertilizer.
As an essential part of our discussion, we have to face the low NH3 Faraday efficiency problem. Hydrogen generation is an inevitable and intrinsic phenomenon even in biological ammonia fixation processes, forcing us to consider the question, will it ever be possible to achieve 100% NH3 production without hydrogen? Considering the current situation, it may be possible to achieve a 50% NH3 Faraday efficiency in the recent decade, but the other 50% of hydrogen still needs to be fully utilized instead of wasted as lost energy. We have established a simple module with several quite strong assumptions to estimate the total energy efficiency combining both the NRR and HER in Section 2.3.5, indicating that some good HER catalysts, despite their ultralow NRR efficiency, can deliver a high overall energy utilization ratio and high NH3 formation rate at low overpotentials compared with some NRR-active materials with higher NH3 FE but larger overpotential. Since hydrogen is also an essentially favored feedstock for a future carbon-free energy system, the total energy efficiency should be taken as a serious criterion along with NH3 yield and FE. Currently one of the mainstream views on how to improve NRR selectivity is to suppress the HER by limiting the proton and electron supply. However, this approach (including decreasing conductivity and increasing mass transfer barrier) will mostly passivate the NRR activity also, leading to a lower NH3 yield and more negative reaction potentials, which ultimately lead to poor total energy efficiency. Accordingly, it will always be favorable to enhance both the NRR and HER by lowering the onset potential as well as increasing the reaction rate and current density instead of enhancing the NRR by suppressing the HER.
The AOR can be an energy-efficient solution for N-rich wastewater purification together with hydrogen production to replace water splitting, as well as a potential direct carbon-free electrochemical power source. The AOR on metals may proceed through two mechanisms: (i) the Oswin–Salomon mechanism, where adsorbed ammonia is sequentially deprotonated into N adatoms which associate into N2 and (ii) the Gerischer–Mauerer mechanism, where N–N coupling occurs between partially dehydrogenated nitrogen species into hydrazine-like intermediates, followed by complete deprotonation into N2. The choice of reaction pathway and related catalytic performance is highly related to the bonding strength of N atoms on metal surfaces. For metals binding N too strongly (Pt and above), the fully deprotonated *N cannot transfer on the surface to form N–N bonds due to high energy barrier, leading to poisoning of the catalyst. For those binding N too weakly, the chemical N–N coupling may not be the rate-determining step, while the reaction will be limited by the hard electrochemical deprotonation steps due to the weak adsorption of intermediates, resulting in an unrealistically high overpotential. Among the transition metals, Pt is found to have the optimal N binding energy. Sadly, although developed very early, most of the research on the AOR during the past fifty years focused on noble-metal based materials, mainly Pt, which can never be practically utilized due to its economic unfeasibility and quick deactivation. Non-noble metal-based catalysts, typically Ni-based materials, have only gained attention in the last decade, with limited data from both experiments and theoretical calculations. Typically, the reaction mechanism on the surface of Ni hydroxides/oxyhydroxides, which are the active phases towards the AOR, remains largely uninvestigated, with no DFT calculations to date. On the other hand, although N poisoning is not observed for Ni-based materials, and incorporation with Cu can significantly improve the corrosion resistance, the problem of nitrite/nitrate production has to be solved. The catalyst should either produce N2 quantitatively or produce NO3− or NO2− solely at low potentials as a potential method for nitric acid production. Oxygen-free and oxyphobic materials may be needed to avoid the formation of oxygenated nitrogen species. Other materials have also been evaluated as potential AOR catalysts, but encouraging results are scarce. However, it should be noted that a large variety of materials has not been investigated, especially research on transition metal oxides/sulfides/phosphides, which have exhibited promising performances in hydrazine or urea oxidation, remains mostly rare.
The HzOR, as a complement to the AOR, is also an important part of the electrochemical nitrogen cycle. As an intermediate reducing product between N2 and NH3, the unstable N–N single bond makes N2H4 highly chemically active matter, making its oxidation much easier than the AOR. The oxidation of hydrazine can be regarded as the latter part of the AOR process following the G–M mechanism. Unlike the AOR where the balance between the chemical N–N coupling and electrochemical deprotonation steps has to be adjusted, the HzOR is totally an electrochemical process, where the reaction kinetics can be well-controlled by applied potentials without the chemical N–N association step, greatly expanding the possible catalyst set. Consequently, as a power source, direct hydrazine fuel cells can deliver higher power and energy density than direct ammonia fuel cells owing to their much quicker reaction kinetics and higher cell voltage. On the other hand, when used for on-site hydrogen-generation, a hydrazine electro-decomposition system will cost less electricity than ammonia. Like in the case of the AOR, the most studied HzOR catalysts are Ni-based materials. However, the two most serious issues limiting the application of hydrazine are its high toxicity and scarce source. Industrially, N2H4 is a fine chemical produced via a series of complicated procedures, rendering its use as fuel economically unfeasible. Recent progress on the NRR implies the possibility of electrochemical hydrazine synthesis directly from atmospheric dinitrogen, although currently there are only a few related reports, such as by Au catalyst in alkaline KOH solution, with extremely low yield and efficiency. Hydrazine production is a side reaction during the NRR following an alternative associative pathway, but the desorption of hydrazine is usually a highly endergonic chemical step and the reaction tends to proceed via further reduction instead. However, if hydrazine is found to be produced at relatively high yield making its separation economically profitable compared with current techniques, an electrochemical hydrazine production and recycling system may be finally possible. The high toxicity of hydrazine makes it unsuitable for daily use, but its high energy density, high power output and mostly zero exhaust may fit in special applications like aerocrafts, spacecrafts and submersibles, although extensive infrastructures and emergency precautions are needed. It is noteworthy that hydrazine can be used to construct self-supporting hydrogen generation systems by connecting a DHFC and a hydrazine decomposition electrolyzer in series, with hydrazine as both the hydrogen carrier and fuel.
Conclusively, a closed nitrogen cycle can be established between N2, NH3 and N2H4 by electrochemical transformation. If in the future a direct nitrogen oxidation catalyst is found, then a complete nitrogen cycle connecting both the reductive and oxidative branches can be finally achieved, enabling the simultaneous production of ammonia and nitric acid by electricity directly from atmospheric nitrogen and water. Based on the electrochemical nitrogen transformation cycle, we can expect a completely carbon-free self-sustainable nitrogen–hydrogen economy based on green energies, as depicted in Fig. 21. Renewable energy such as solar, wind, tidal and geothermal energy can be utilized to drive an NRR electrolyzer, which continuously produces low-concentration ammonia solution on-site as liquid fertilizer to feed crops and plants, saving the cost of ammonia storage and transportation; the by-produced hydrogen can be collected to recycle the electric energy, which can be used to self-support the NRR electrolyzer to reduce total energy consumption, either directly coupled as an anode reaction to decrease the total cell voltage or used to power a hydrogen fuel cell to indirectly power the NRR process; and the hydrogen can also be stored or transferred for other uses such as vehicles and residential fuel cell stacks. The ammonia-rich wastewater from fertilizer elution, industrial exhaust, domestic sewage and stockbreeding downstream can be purified via the AOR process. Depending on the ammonia concentration, highly NH3-concentrated wastewater can be used as feedstock of DAFC for electricity recovery, while diluted ones can be electrolyzed for hydrogen production. The hydrogen again can be consumed on-site to compensate the electricity cost or transferred for other uses. This system is completely carbon-free and can utilize both hydrogen and ammonia produced to the greatest extent, recovering most of the energy waste by self-supporting design with the minimum requirement of additional energy input and ideally no negative environmental impact. Although many parts of this puzzle are still missing, such a prospect is encouraging. With the demand of ever-growing ammonia supply and aggravating environmental and energy crisis, the past carbon-intensive nitrogen industry based on fossil fuels cannot sustain the coming age. To realize such a nitrogen-based economy, the catalyst design as a core part towards various nitrogen transformation reactions is of unambiguous importance, where an understanding and control of the reaction process at the molecular level is crucial, as well as the cost/performance balance and commercial scaling and generalization. Combination with other techniques such as photocatalytic and biological nitrogen transformation as well as other electrocatalytic processes such as carbon dioxide electroreduction may open new possibilities in the future.
