E-mail: hamann@chemistry.msu.eduReceived 2nd May 2013, Accepted 29th May 2013First published on 30th May 2013AbstractHematite's favorable 2.1 eV band gap, valence band position, stability, abundance, and light absorption properties make it a promising semiconductor material for solar-driven water oxidation. While a mechanism for water oxidation at the surface of hematite has not yet been experimentally established, it is widely agreed upon that surface-state mediated charge recombination at the electrode–electrolyte interface competes with water oxidation. This kinetic competition ultimately limits the water splitting efficiency. The identity and role of these surface states in the water oxidation reaction is still unclear. This perspective presents recent results in probing photocatalytic water oxidation with hematite electrodes and the role of surface states. In addition, the function of surface coatings on the hematite surface, and their role as catalysts or surface passivation materials, are discussed.I. IntroductionThere is an eminent need to reduce our dependence on carbon-based fuels in order to minimize the worst potential outcomes associated with climate change.1–3 The Sun irradiates the Earth's surface with an average of ∼1 kW m−2, making it the largest energy resource available. Solar energy conversion is thus uniquely capable of completely supplanting our dependence on carbon-based fuels.4 Efficient solar-to-electricity conversion has been available for decades; single crystal silicon and gallium arsenide photovoltaic cells have achieved power conversion efficiencies of ∼25% and ∼29%, respectively.5 One of the primary drawbacks which limits widespread use of these cells is their high cost.6,7 In addition, since sunlight is diurnal and intermittent, effective means of storing solar-generated electricity must be developed. Further, some of our major energy uses (e.g. transportation) require liquid fuels since they have a higher energy density than direct solar illumination can provide. Therefore, the development of materials that are able to convert solar energy into chemical fuels are of great interest.Nature provides a great example of using solar energy to produce fuels in the process of photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, solar energy is used to drive a series of charge-transfer reactions which ultimately oxidize water to release O2 and reduce CO2 to produce hydrocarbon materials. The overall solar energy to stored fuel conversion efficiency of photosynthesis is estimated to be only ∼1%,8 however, which prevents it from being a practical solution to supplying the world's fuel demands. Taking a page from Nature, there has been an ongoing effort to develop artificial photosynthesis systems capable of converting solar energy into high energy density chemical fuels.9,10 There are two chemical reaction schemes that have received the most attention; reduction of CO2 to produce carbonaceous fuels such as methanol and water splitting to produce hydrogen gas: CO2 + 2H2O → CH3OH + O2(1) H2O → H2 + ½O2(2)We will only consider water splitting herein and refer interested readers to recent reviews on CO2 reduction.10–13One strategy is to adapt photovoltaic systems capable of achieving high efficiencies to drive the water splitting reactions in a scalable fashion. Several artificial photosynthetic schemes have been devised to address this challenge. The most straightforward approaches are to directly link a photovoltaic device to an electrolyzer or to couple water oxidation and reduction catalysts on the surface of a buried photovoltaic device. For example, Nocera's group recently utilized a buried triple junction amorphous silicon photovoltaic device coated with a cobalt-phosphate water oxidation catalyst and a NiMoZn water reduction catalyst, termed the ‘Artificial Leaf’.14 This is a promising system in that it utilizes only earth abundant materials, is stable, and evolves H2 in a variety of aqueous environments.14,15 The efficiency of this cell is primarily limited by use of the amorphous silicon photovoltaic driving the reactions. An alternative example is a dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cell, which is a close analog to the dye-sensitized solar cell except that the oxidized sensitizer formed following charge injection into TiO2 nanoparticles drives water oxidation as opposed to oxidation of a redox shuttle.16–18 While these types of systems can offer tunability as a result of separate oxidation and reduction components used to evolve hydrogen and oxygen, they currently rely on rare metal centers for catalyst materials as well as sensitizers that may not offer long term stability.The first and most widely studied form of solar energy conversion consists of semiconductor-liquid junctions (SCLJ).19 Using SCLJs for solar energy ignited in 1972 with the seminal report by Fujishima and Honda in which they demonstrated photo-assisted water splitting on single crystal TiO2 electrodes.20 Since that report, other materials have been used for solar energy conversion resulting in high photon-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency demonstrating the promise of utilizing such a system.21,22 For a single material to achieve efficient, unassisted water splitting driven by visible light, a combination of several challenging material requirements must be met: absorption of a sufficient portion of the visible solar spectrum, band edge positions capable of generating H2 and O2, and electrode stability in aqueous electrolytes over a range of pH conditions. Further, since it needs to be scalable, the semiconductors must be comprised of earth abundant materials. These requirements make up a ‘tall order’ and to this date no single semiconductor composed of earth abundant materials has been able to produce sustained, efficient water splitting. There are several alternative configurations of SCLJs that relax some of the constraints placed on a single absorbing material which are also capable of achieving efficient photo-driven water splitting. In an ideal example, the two redox half reactions can be relegated to separate materials – a photocathode which absorbs low energy photons for the proton reduction and a photoanode which absorbs high energy photons for water oxidation. Not only is this configuration capable of absorbing a greater fraction of the solar spectrum, it also allows for both photoelectrode materials to be investigated and optimized for the proton reduction and water oxidation reactions independently and in parallel. Several possible material configurations for use in water splitting have been discussed elsewhere.19 There is a paucity of feasible photoanode materials that are known, however. In addition, the photocatalytic water oxidation reaction is one of the key processes which limit the efficiency of photoanodes, and thus overall water splitting. In this review, we therefore discuss the photoanode material which has received the most attention recently and will focus on the water oxidation reaction at its surface.II. HematiteOne of the most promising photoanode materials for water oxidation is hematite (α-Fe2O3). Hematite possesses a corundum structure with FeIII cations in a slightly distorted octahedral environment. The conduction band is comprised of Fe 3d orbitals and the valence band originates from Fe 3d(2t2g) and O 2p orbitals.23 The energy difference between the bands produces a bandgap of 2.1 eV, which allows hematite to absorb photons out to 590 nm. Integration of the 2.1 eV bandgap with the AM 1.5 solar spectrum results in a maximum possible photocurrent density of 12.5 mA cm−2.24,25 The theoretical solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, ηSTH, can be calculated from the following equation: (3)where Jop is the operating current density of the cell, 1.23 V is the Nernstian potential difference corresponding to the free energy change for the conversion of one molecule of H2O to H2 and 1/2 O2 under standard conditions (ΔG = 237 kJ mol−1), η is any additional overpotential which needs to be applied to produce the operating current density, and Pin is in the incident light power density (for one sun, 100 mW cm−2).19 Pairing hematite with a material capable of matching hematite's maximum current density through absorption of longer wavelength light transmitted through hematite, and which is capable of hydrogen evolution and supplying any additional overpotential to hematite, the maximum theoretical solar-to-hydrogen efficiency is ∼15%. The light harvesting efficiency, LHE, of incident photons by a semiconductor is dependent on the material absorption coefficient, α, and the thickness, l, according to LHE = 1 − e−αl. Thus, any given semiconductor needs to be 3/α thick in order to absorb 95% of the light at a given wavelength. For example, hematite, with α = 8 × 104 cm−1 at 550 nm, needs to be 400 nm thick to absorb 95% of the light at this wavelength.26 In addition to good light absorption, hematite is stable in contact with neutral and basic aqueous electrolytes. The combination of visible light absorption and stability is largely what sets hematite apart from other materials. In addition, the hematite valence band energy is low enough, EVB/q = 2.71 V versus RHE, to allow photogenerated holes to drive the water oxidation reaction (Fig. 1). Hematite's conduction band is energetically too low to reduce water to H2, however as noted above. Application of an external bias through an additional photovoltaic device or implementation of hematite as the photoanode material in a tandem system can facilitate efficient overall photocatalytic water splitting. Fig. 1  Schematic SCLJ energetics of water oxidation on a hematite photoanode. The green arrows represent favorable charge transfer pathways and the red arrows represent recombination pathways. Despite these favorable characteristics, the overall solar energy conversion efficiency with hematite electrodes has been poor. The efficiency of solar driven water oxidation on a semiconductor photoanode is controlled by the efficiency of three general processes: light harvesting, the transport of photogenerated holes to the solution interface (hole transport efficiency) and hole collection via water oxidation at the electrode surface (water oxidation efficiency). The relatively long visible light absorption depth (hundreds of nanometers) combined with a very short minority charge collection length (∼10 nm) prevent realizing both a high LHE and hole transport efficiency necessary to achieve high overall solar-to-fuel conversion efficiencies.26–32 Much of the recent work on hematite has therefore focused on nanostructuring and doping strategies in order to overcome these drawbacks.33–36 We refer the interested reader to several reviews on the challenges, limitations and solutions for the mismatched light absorption and hole collection distances.23,26,37,38While nanostructuring and doping can improve the efficiency of getting photogenerated holes to the electrode–electrolyte interface, these holes must still be collected efficiently. The water oxidation reaction at the hematite electrode surface is generally reported to be sluggish which allows for increased recombination at the electrode surface with a concomitant loss in efficiency.37,39–43 We were able to demonstrate this by comparing the current density versus applied potential (J–V) response of a hematite electrode in contact with an aqueous electrolyte to that of an electrolyte containing a fast hole collector under identical conditions. Fig. 2 shows that there is a significant difference in photocurrent response of H2O oxidation compared to oxidation of the fast hole collector, [Fe(CN)6]4−. From these experiments it was determined that a planar hematite electrode in contact with a fast, one-electron redox couple [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− is only limited by the fraction of holes that reach the semiconductor/liquid interface.31,32,43,44 In other words, the surface–hole collection efficiency by [Fe(CN)6]4− is essentially unity and the surface–hole collection efficiency for H2O oxidation is less than unity. We note that similar conclusions were reached by Dotan et al. using a H2O2 as a hole collector.45 Understanding the water oxidation mechanism at the hematite surface is crucial in order to achieve unity hole collection with water.

Photoanodes were illuminated through the substrate side. Reproduced with permission from ref. 43. Peter and co-workers used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) to study the kinetics of water oxidation at hematite electrodes. A phenomenological model was developed in order to interpret their data, which assumed hole transfer to water occurs from surface states, or surface intermediates.40,46 Note: the terminology of hole transfer to a species implies an oxidation of that species. Their model describes the kinetic competition between charge transfer (water oxidation) from the surface states and recombination with conduction band electrons at those surface states. An unvarying recombination rate constant was measured over several hundred millivolts which suggested that band bending was not changing as a function of applied potential over this range, i.e. the Fermi level was pinned. Also, a potential dependent rate constant for water oxidation on hematite was measured which suggests that the potential drop in the Helmholtz layer influences the activation energy for the oxygen evolution process.40Our group has also recently employed EIS under varying conditions of applied voltage, light intensity, electrolyte, and pH to investigate the steps involved in water oxidation. An equivalent circuit based model, which includes the charge buildup and charge transfer through surface states at the semiconductor/liquid interface, was used to interpret the impedance spectra.82 Our EIS results showed the charging of a surface state which is observed as a Gaussian capacitance, Css, coincides with the photocurrent onset potential (Fig. 3). In addition, the charge transfer resistance from this surface state, Rct,ss, reached a minimum at the water oxidation onset potential, also shown in Fig. 3. In order to confirm our interpretation the EIS data, we also measured the nominally identical charging of surface states through cyclic voltammetry measurements and through quantifying anodic and cathodic photocurrent transients, which are attributed to the reversible oxidation and reduction of surface states, respectively.43 Analogous EIS, transient photocurrent, and cyclic voltammetric measurements were made with [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− in solution; however, in this case there was no evidence of surface states being present/involved in the hole collection. These combined results are one piece of evidence that suggests that the surface states are intermediates of the water oxidation mechanism. Fig. 3  Relationship between J–V curve (green solid line), surface state capacitance, Css (orange triangles) and charge transfer resistance, Rct,ss (red circles) values obtained under 1 sun illumination at pH 6.9 for a planar 60 nm thick hematite electrode. Impedance data was fit using an equivalent circuit model. Reproduced with permission from ref. 47. In order to address the question of what species are generated following the trapping of photogenerated holes at the surface during water oxidation, Peter and coworkers used light-modulated absorbance spectroscopy (LMAS) and potential-modulated absorption spectroscopy (PMAS) measurements to detect surface species generated under illumination and applied potential, respectively.39,41 Both measurements produce essentially identical absorption spectra which are shown in Fig. 4a. Peter and coworkers attributed the absorption spectra to iron species at the electrode surface with a higher valence state (e.g. FeIV).39 In other words, trapping photogenerated valence band holes in surface states consists of oxidizing surface FeIII species (e.g. FeIII–OH) to a surface FeIV species (e.g. FeIVO).

(b) Change in absorbance of hematite photoanodes at various applied biases in the range of 0.7–1.6 V relative to 0.6 V versus RHE is shown. Reproduced with permission from ref. 48. Durrant and co-workers used transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) to monitor the evolution of photogenerated species with hematite electrodes under water oxidation conditions.37,42,49,50 A general quantitative correlation between the population of long-lived holes and the photocurrent amplitude was found, suggesting that long-lived holes need to be generated to initiate water oxidation (i.e. only at very positive potentials where electron extraction is efficient).42 In Fig. 5a the yield of long-lived holes is shown to be determined by the kinetics of electron–hole recombination, which is dependent upon applied bias. Water oxidation was observed to occur on a timescale of hundreds of milliseconds to seconds which was determined by the photogenerated hole lifetimes ranging from 5 μs to 3 ms shown in Fig. 5b. They additionally compared the kinetics of H2O oxidation on hematite with TiO2 in PEC cells using TAS in combination with variable temperature measurements.37 The rate limiting step for both materials was assigned to be a hole transfer from the metal oxide to a solution or surface-bound water species, such as OH−. In addition, their combined results indicated that the mechanism of water oxidation with hematite occurs via a series of one-electron oxidation steps. The chemical nature of their long-lived holes was not specifically indicated; however their absorption spectrum shown in Fig. 4b is very similar to the LMAS and PMAS spectra in Fig. 4a measured by Peter and co-workers, with an absorbance peak at 580 nm. This indicates they are monitoring the same species as in the photoelectrochemical measurements; the long-lived holes are very likely the same species as surface-trapped holes.

There appears to be general agreement that surface states play an important role in determining the water oxidation efficiency. Specifically, recombination at these surface states competes with the forward water oxidation reaction and it is this kinetic rivalry that controls the overall efficiency. There is disagreement, however, as to the role of the surface states as well the chemical identity of the states. It is not clear whether they represent intermediates in the overall water oxidation reaction39,43 or are other surface states which participate in parallel parasitic reactions.42,49,51 These different interpretations are shown schematically in Fig. 6. Clearly it is important to understand the mechanism of the water oxidation reaction on hematite surfaces if strategies are to be developed to improve the water oxidation efficiency. The details of the water oxidation mechanism with hematite have not been experimentally elucidated. Recent theoretical investigations, however, provide mechanistic insight, including possible reaction intermediates.

Hellman and Pala utilized first principles methods to calculate the thermodynamics of reaction mechanisms involved in the photoelectrochemical oxidation of water on five different surface terminations of Fe2O3 (0001) surfaces, shown in Fig. 7.52 The coordination environment at the surface of metal oxides influences the kinetics and thermodynamics of water oxidation. First principles investigations show that on the hematite surface, hydroxylation of Fe2O3 is spontaneous.52–54 Using both theory and experiments, Trainor et al. provided evidence that fully hydroxylated species, (OH)3–Fe–H3O3–R and (OH)3–R, where R represents the bulk hematite crystal, are the thermodynamically most stable surface configurations of the (0001) surface in aqueous environments.55 Fig. 7  Five possible surface terminations of α-Fe2O3: (a) (OH)3–Fe–H3O3–R, (b) (OH)3–Fe–O3–R, (c) O3–Fe–O3–R, (d) (OH)3–R, and (e) O3–R. The unit cell is shown by the solid line. Reproduced with permission from ref. 52. Considering these terminations, the initial step in photo-oxidation of the hydroxylated terminations, e.g. (OH)3–Fe–H3O3–R, consists of (4) oxidation of the surface terminated hydroxyl species and the removal of a proton, (5) subsequent attack by a water molecule and oxidative dissociation of a proton produces a surface peroxide intermediate species, (6) evolution of O2 from this peroxide intermediate, leaving an unsaturated iron site and finally, (7) coordination of a second water molecule completes the catalytic cycle. This is summarized in the following reaction scheme: h+(VB) + Fe–OH → Fe–O + H+(4) h+(VB) + Fe–O + H2O → Fe–OOH + H+(5) h+(VB) + Fe–OOH → O2 + Fe + H+(6) h+(VB) + Fe + H2O → Fe–OH + H+(7)The calculated free energy of the water splitting reactions on (OH)3–Fe–H3O3–R, (OH)3–Fe–O3–R, and O3–Fe–O3–R terminations showed that the potential of the photoinduced valence band hole is sufficient to make all reaction steps thermodynamically favorable. Water oxidation on both (OH)3–Fe–R and O3–Fe–R surfaces have reaction steps that are uphill, however.52 The formation of the reaction intermediates, Fe–O and Fe–OOH, are consistent with the suggestion by Peter of holes being trapped as highly valent iron species at the electrode surface. In addition, Durrant's suggestion that the rate limiting step is hole transfer to a surface-bound water species is consistent with this mechanism. We note that the surface bound water species can be interpreted as an aqua, hydroxy, oxo, or peroxy ligand coordinated to a surface iron atom.While there is still a paucity of direct experimental evidence of the photocatalytic water oxidation mechanism on hematite, TiO2 has been an extensively studied material for photocatalytic water splitting. Several authors have examined the monumental body of literature and written extensive reviews which focus on the surface of TiO2.56–59 The interested reader is directed to these reviews for the most detailed description of the field. There are two main experimentally derived mechanisms, labeled the redox photooxidation (RP) mechanism and the nucleophillic attack (NA) mechanism, put forth to explain water oxidation on the (110) rutile surface.60 While differing on the details by which water oxidation is initiated, these two mechanisms share several commonalities. Each mechanism proceeds by two oxidation reactions of proximate surface bound hydroxyl species to generate two hydroxyl radicals in the RP mechanism and one in the NA mechanism. EPR studies have shown that hydroxyl radicals are generated upon the photooxidation of water at TiO2,61,62 and that these radicals are adsorbed to the surface and not free in solution.63 Both mechanisms also suggest that a covalent bond is formed between the two adjacent reactive oxygen species to produce a surface adsorbed peroxo species. The generation of a peroxo species is supported through in situ multiple internal reflection infrared absorption spectra which shows two peaks at 838 and 812 cm−1 which are assigned to the O–O stretching of Ti–O–OH and Ti–O–O–Ti, respectively.64 Further oxidation of the surface bound peroxo species results in the evolution of O2. These mechanisms differ from the theoretical predictions for hematite described above in that two adjacent Ti atoms are involved in water oxidation with a bridging peroxyl intermediate species, whereas water oxidation on hematite is calculated to proceed from a single metal site.In addition to photocatalytic water oxidation on electrode surfaces, there has been extensive studies of homogeneous water oxidation catalysts (WOC).65,66 Recently, over sixty different mononuclear Ru based catalysts have been reviewed, illustrating their stability, activity, and mechanism for water oxidation.67–72 Analogous to water oxidation on TiO2, there are two fundamental water oxidation mechanisms that are generally accepted to reach the key O–O bond formation step, which were recently described by Wasylenko et al.:73 (1) a radical coupling pathway (RC) in which two radical metal-oxo units are coupled forming a M–O–O–M complex that can undergo further oxidation to generate O270,74 and (2) the water nucleophilic attack (WNA) in which an oxo-ligand bound to a high-valent metal is attacked by H2O to form an O–O bond which subsequently undergoes a two electron reduction to generate O2.75–78 Most relevant to understanding water oxidation with hematite electrodes is water oxidation with iron-based WOCs. The first example of this was presented by Bernhard, Collins and coworkers which consisted of a FeIII coordinated to tetraamido macrocyclic ligands, referred to as FeIII-TAMLs.79 In their initial report, they showed that upon addition of CeIV, O2 was evolved at varying rates with four different FeIII-TAMLs substituents. Fig. 8 shows the absorption spectra of an [FeVB*(O)]− species, where B* is the tetraamide ligand shown in the inset. The FeV spectrum looks strikingly like the absorption spectra of the hematite surface species displayed in Fig. 4a, suggesting that the surface state may actually be a high valent FeV-oxo intermediate. Fig. 8  Electronic absorption spectra of [FeIIIB*(H2O)]− (dashed line), the diiron(IV) dimer (dotted line) and [FeVB*(O)]−, (solid line). Inset: iron(III)-aqua complex, [FeIIIB*(H2O)]−, where the free-base H4B* tetraamide is 3,3,6,6,9,9-hexamethyl-3,4,8,9-tetrahydro-1H-1,4,8,11-benzotetraazacyclotridecine-2,5,7,10(6H,11H)-tetraone. Reproduced with permission from ref. 80. Fillol et al. investigated water oxidation with FeII complexes having neutral nitrogen-containing tetradentate ligands with two free cis coordination sites.81 The most active iron complex, [Fe(OTf)2(Me2Pytacn)] (Me2Pytacn = 1-(2′pyridylmethyl)-4,7-dimethyl-1,4,7-triazacylononane), generated observable gas bubbles upon addition of CeIV oxidant which were confirmed to be solely O2 produced from water oxidation. To gain insight into the mechanism for water oxidation, UV-vis measurements were employed to monitor spectral changes for the general [Fe(X)2(LN4)] (where X is a Cl or OTF ligand in a cis-position and LN4 is for a tetraazadentate ligand) complexes by titrating a freshly prepared [Fe(X)2(LN4)] solution with CeIV. A new absorption band was observed to grow in at λmax = 776 nm, characteristic of an FeIVO species; this assignment was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The 776 nm absorption peak attributed to FeIVO remained upon addition of more CeIV while O2 was still being generated. Further, the 776 nm peak decreased in parallel to consumption of the CeIV oxidant. From these experimental observations, the researchers concluded that the FeIVO species was a stable catalytic resting state and that additional oxidation by CeIV may also generate a higher oxidation state iron species that is responsible for water oxidation. Thus, they propose that iron complexes with the general formula [Fe(X)2(LN4)] are initially oxidized to the LN4FeIVO resting state followed by an additional one electron oxidation to form a highly oxidizing LN4FeVO intermediate. The following attack by a solvent water molecule forms the important O–O bond and produces an LN4FeIII–OOH intermediate complex.74,81 The formation of a FeV intermediate species which is attacked by water (hydroxide) is consistent with the assignment by Collins et al.ConsilienceConsidering the mechanistic experimental evidence of photocatalytic water oxidation with TiO2 and iron-based WOCs presented above, and the indirect results of hematite, some general principles can be applied to water oxidation with hematite. Four sequential valence band hole-transfer reactions appear likely and the calculated mechanism of water oxidation with hematite is analogous to the mechanism of molecular iron based catalysts. For the molecular systems, CeIV is used as a chemical oxidant, which has a redox potential of 1.72 V versus RHE.82 Hematite valence band holes are approximately one volt more oxidizing and can therefore readily produce similar high valent surface iron intermediates, consistent with the calculated thermodynamics. Thus, the first steps in water oxidation with hematite electrodes appear to be oxidation of surface iron-hydroxide species, followed by formation of an iron-peroxide species. These reaction intermediates are likely what have been termed “surface trapped holes” or “long lived holes” at the electrode surface. It is not clear, however, if water oxidation occurs at a single iron site, like the molecular catalysts, or from two iron sites, similar to TiO2. In addition, it is interesting to note that there are hematite surface terminations which are thermodynamically prevented from fully oxidizing water with valence band holes. For example, the (OH)3–R surface can be oxidized to produce an intermediate peroxide species, analogous to the first two steps in water oxidation shown in reactions (4) and (5). Subsequent photo-oxidation to release O2 is hindered, however, by the stability of this intermediate. This surface will thus trap holes in surface states that would not lead to water oxidation, but should allow surface state recombination (see Fig. 6b). While there is still a lack of direct experimental evidence of the identity of these intermediates, comparisons of the absorption data and the molecular WOCs indicate they may be a FeVO species. In addition, especially with the high surface area electrodes often studied, there may well be a variety of surfaces available which may lead to some combination of Fig. 6a and b. Irrespective of the mechanistic details discussed above, there is wide agreement that recombination at surface states of hematite limits the photocurrent onset potential and thus the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency.43,46,83–85 It is therefore reasonable to modify the electrode surface in order to improve the water oxidation efficiency.III. Surface coatingsSince the water oxidation efficiency is determined by the number of holes at the surface that participate in the water oxidation reaction rather than recombine with conduction band electrons, the efficiency should be improved by either accelerating the rate of water oxidation or reducing the rate of surface-state recombination. Addition of a water oxidation catalyst to the hematite surface should accelerate the water oxidation kinetics and thus improve the water oxidation efficiency. Passivation of the surface states facilitating recombination should minimize this reaction and also improve the overall water oxidation efficiency.86 There are many examples in the literature of materials being added to the surface of hematite which have been shown to shift the photocurrent onset potential cathodically, thereby increasing the photocatalytic water oxidation efficiency. Since both strategies – catalysis and surface passivation – would produce the same macroscopic effect of shifting the photocurrent onset, identification of the actual mechanism of improvement is not straightforward to unambiguously determine. Nevertheless, we separate our discussion into materials that are either likely catalysts or are claimed to be catalytic and non-catalytic materials that are claimed to passivate surface states.i. CatalystsCobalt oxide. The most widely studied family of water oxidation catalysts on hematite surfaces are cobalt oxides. The first example of depositing a cobalt oxide catalyst on hematite photoelectrodes was the landmark report by Grätzel and co-workers.34 In that work, cobalt ions were deposited by dipping a nanostructured hematite electrode in a cobalt(II) nitrate solution. This procedure was estimated to form monolayer coverage of a CoOx species. This cobalt dipcoating treatment resulted in an 80 mV cathodic shift in the photocurrent onset potential, and an increase in the photocurrent density. This increase in photocatalytic activity was attributed to accelerated oxygen evolution by the cobalt catalyst. Based on literature arguments, analogous to those presented above, the authors speculated that photogenerated valence band holes may be trapped as CoIII species, which in turn can be oxidized by an additional valence band hole to produce a CoIV species. They went a step further and proposed the mechanism shown in Fig. 9. While this mechanism was put forth as a hypothesis, we note that it is very consistent with the mechanism of water oxidation by TiO2 and molecular WOCs described above. This mechanism is also analogous to the mechanism of water oxidation proposed on hematite surfaces. Fig. 9  Proposed mechanism for water oxidation on a cobalt-modified hematite electrode. (S0 to S4): adjacent Co centers capture four photogenerated holes paired with deprotonation of the surface hydroxyl groups generates a high valent CoIV with attached oxo group. An O–O bond and a peroxo intermediate (S4′) is formed following nucleophilic attack from a hydroxide on a single CoIVO. O2 is generated after a hydrogen transfer to the second CoIVO. The catalytic cycle is closed upon rehydroxylation of the dangling CoII coordination site by the electrolyte. A similar mechanism can be postulated with Fe in place of Co. Reproduced with permission from ref. 34. While the cobalt dipcoating method has been reproduced on numerous occasions, which has always produced a shift in the photocurrent onset to more cathodic potentials, the affect of the cobalt is still uncertain.39,46,48 Peter and co-workers performed IMPS to determine the kinetic processes that give rise to the onset potential shift. Their analysis indicated that the cathodic shift of their cobalt nitrate treated hematite electrodes was due to a reduction in the rate constant of surface state recombination, not acceleration of the rate of water oxidation. It is surprising that the rate of water oxidation on an iron oxide surface would be nominally identical to a cobalt oxide surface. Since the surface coverage is unknown, and the cobalt oxide species is not stable, it is not clear if water oxidation is occurring from the native iron oxide surface, surface cobalt species, surface iron species, or a combination of the like. If the hematite surface is coated with approximately a monolayer of cobalt oxide, then it is likely that water oxidation occurs by the mechanism shown in Fig. 9.A recent alternative approach was presented by Riha et al. who employed atomic layer deposition (ALD) to deposit cobalt oxide on hematite photoelectrodes.87 ALD is very well-suited to the deposition of overlayers since its self-limiting, vapor-phase surface chemistry enables uniform angstrom-level thickness control on nanostructured electrodes with excellent reproducibility.88 They found that a single ALD cycle, consisting of sequential exposure to Co(cp)2 and O3, produced sub-monolayer coverage of CoII (hydr)oxide–Co3O4. This single ALD cycle produced a clear cathodic shift in the current onset potential of 100–200 mV. EIS measurements on hematite electrodes coated with the sub-monolayer of CoII–Co3O4 showed a combination of a reduction in the steady-state concentration of oxidized surface states along with the reduction of charge transfer resistance from those surface states. In addition, Mott Schottky plots suggested that the cobalt layer did not affect the band bending. A decrease in the charge transfer resistance from surface states and Fermi level suggests that catalysis at the molecular level was achieved. Interestingly, when three Co(cp)2–O3 ALD cycles were deposited, the performance decreased to a level comparable to the bare electrode (but with significantly more dark current). In this case, the surface is likely completely composed of cobalt oxide. It is not clear why a sub-monolayer coating of cobalt oxide is better than both a pure hematite surface and pure cobalt oxide surface; perhaps there is a synergy between neighboring Fe and Co atoms on the surface which facilitate water oxidation. This is an intriguing notion which deserves further study.Another treatment for hematite electrodes that has received a great deal of attention is the deposition of the phosphate-mediated cobalt oxide catalyst (commonly labeled “Co-Pi”) made famous by Kanan and Nocera.47,89–94 Co-Pi has the added benefit of a “self-healing” mechanism in the presence of phosphate ions which is in contrast to the instability of the cobalt nitrate dipcoating treatment. The addition of Co-Pi to hematite has the effect of shifting the current onset cathodically by 100–240 mV. Zhong and Gamelin were the first group to deposit Co-Pi onto hematite films; initially through electrodeposition91,92 and then via photo-assisted electrodeposition.94 They found a 5-fold enhancement in the photocurrent density and water oxidation rate at 1.0 V vs. RHE for Co-Pi coated electrodes relative to bare hematite. They attributed this enhancement to a mechanism in which water oxidation occurs through the cobalt sites of the Co-Pi. Such a mechanism is supported by the observation of the capacitive, hole storing ability of the Co-Pi. They also compared the effect of the Co-Pi catalyst to dipcoating in the cobalt nitrate solution and found it produced significantly superior enhancement.94 Barroso, et al. electrodeposited Co-Pi onto mesoporous Nb-doped hematite films and suggested that the Co-Pi layer increases band bending of the hematite by acting as an electron acceptor. As band bending increases, charge separation is increased and surface recombination is decreased. This conclusion was made based on transient absorption spectroscopy measurements where they observed similar decay dynamics for Co-Pi coated hematite electrodes and bare hematite electrodes at more anodic biases. This implies that the Co-Pi is passive, and the water oxidation is still occurring at the hematite surface.93 Our lab has also deposited Co-Pi onto hematite, although on planar films instead of nanostructured films.47 The deposition onto planar films allowed us to perform a controlled thickness dependence where the electrodes could be illuminated from the substrate side, such that the Co-Pi would not compete with light absorption. Through this thickness dependence, we were able to determine that charge is stored in the Co-Pi and that the charge transfer to water comes from the Co-Pi and not the hematite. Increasing the thickness of the Co-Pi shifted the current onset cathodically as a result of placing holes from the hematite farther away from the surface where electrons in the conduction band are able to combine. Further, EIS measurements showed that the addition of Co-Pi did not significantly change the capacitance of the bulk hematite, i.e. Co-Pi did not increase band bending. While the general mechanism for this enhancement is not entirely agreed upon, all studies would agree that the cathodic shift is at least partially due to a reduction in recombination of electrons to iron based surface states.Importantly, for the focus of this review, at low applied potentials, charge was able to be stored into the Co-Pi layer without oxidizing water. It is only at positive bias where the Co-Pi has a sufficient concentration of holes in the layer that water oxidation begins. One way of explaining this would be if water oxidation occurs at Co-Pi through a bimolecular mechanism. This is consistent with the mechanism proposed by Nocera et al. which describes the oxidation of two adjacent CoIII–OH groups to two CoIVO groups (Fig. 10).95 Only when two CoIVO groups are in close proximity will oxygen be evolved. Established in pH 7 conditions, this mechanism is based on the observation of CoIV species isolated during water oxidation conditions measured by electron paramagnetic response (EPR) measurements as well as pH titration experiments.96,97 Through the study of a model cubane molecule, which was prepared in order to study the kinetics of this proton coupled electron transfer, the described mechanism is supported as well.98 In addition, mechanistic analogies can be made with water oxidation on TiO2 where a bridging Ti–O–O–Ti species is formed prior to forming the important O–O bond before oxidizing water. We note that this may explain the need to build up charge in the hematite surface state prior to the onset of water oxidation.

The most successful example of adding a water oxidation catalyst to hematite is when atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) hematite electrodes were coated with IrO2 nanoparticles.99 These electrodes were able to achieve an unsurpassed photocurrent density of 3 mA cm−2 at an applied potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE. Unfortunately, the instability of the IrO2, coupled with the rarity of iridium makes this system an impractical choice. It should be noted that the role of the IrO2 is assumed to be a catalyst, however no direct evidence was provided to demonstrate accelerated water oxidation kinetics. IrO2 is one of the best performing water oxidation catalysts known, and the most likely affect of the IrO2 nanoparticles is catalysis.ii. Surface passivation coatingsAnother strategy to improve the water oxidation efficiency is to coat the hematite surface with a non-catalytic material in order to passivate surface states. The first example of this used for water oxidation applications was by Le Formal et al. who added thin layers of alumina by ALD to hematite films prepared via APCVD.85 A decrease in the current onset potential of ∼100 mV was measured. It should be noted that alumina is well known to be unstable in the strong alkali conditions of these experiments (1 M NaOH), although it appeared to be sufficiently stable for up to 30 minutes. This decrease in the current onset potential is hypothesized to be due to the passivation of surface states. This hypothesis is based on a reduction in the photocurrent transients which are associated with the oxidation and reduction surface states, and the observation of photoluminescence, which is not observed with bare hematite electrodes. Similar experiments and reasoning has been used to describe the decrease in the current onset potential for Ga2O3,100 In2O3,100 ZnO,101 and NixFe2−xO3102 overlayers when deposited on hematite electrodes.Surface passivation is also used to describe the cathodic shifting effects of both CoOx and Ga2O3 surface modifications by Durrant and coworkers.48 This surface passivation is hypothesized to reduce Fermi level pinning at those surface states, which results in a larger depletion region for a given applied potential, compared to a bare electrode.48 This conclusion was based on the observation of an increase in hole lifetime at more cathodic potentials. This is consistent with increasing the potential of a bare electrode, i.e., increasing the depletion width.IV. ConclusionFrom the experiments discussed above, there are clearly two different general mechanisms which are invoked for describing water oxidation with hematite electrodes, depicted in Fig. 6. Both mechanisms discuss a surface which is able to be oxidized by photogenerated holes from the valence band, and reduced by electrons in the conduction band. The concomitant oxidation and reduction of this surface, called surface-state recombination, is a process which is the primary contributor to the large applied potential which is necessary to oxidize water. Both mechanisms also recognize that as an anodic potential is applied, the band bending increases, which results in a low concentration of electrons at the surface, thereby diminishing recombination at the surface. The differences in interpretation lie in the nature and the role of this surface state.One mechanism interprets the oxidized surface (surface-trapped hole) as a high-valent iron intermediate species generated as part of the overall water oxidation mechanism, as depicted in Fig. 6a. The formation of this intermediate species results in a capacitance/charge that nearly all research groups measure near the photocurrent onset potential. This interpretation is consistent with theoretical predictions of the mechanism shown in eqn (4)–(7), as well as the known water oxidation mechanism on the TiO2 surface and with molecular catalysts. The absorption spectrum of the intermediate species also matches the spectrum of high-valent iron species formed via homogeneous water oxidation reactions. An alternative mechanism describes water oxidation as a parallel reaction to surface-state recombination, where photo-generated holes in the valence band oxidize a surface-bound water species (Fig. 6b). As noted above, a surface-bound water species could be an iron hydroxide, which is also consistent with the theory results indicating that the fully hydroxylated surface is the thermodynamically favored one. This mechanism raises two questions: what is the surface state involved in recombination and why doesn't the water oxidation intermediates participate in recombination?It should be noted that most of the experiments of research groups invoking the two different mechanisms are consistent with each other suggesting that the difference in the assignment of the mechanism seems to be primarily a difference in interpretation, and not experimental results. For example, absorbance spectra of surface holes/intermediates on hematite both show a maximum absorbance at 580 nm in the labs of both Peter and Durrant.37,39,41,49 Another example is the capacitance of surface states measured at the current onset potential through EIS, and quantifying current transients is similar in our lab which subscribes to the general mechanism in Fig. 6a and studies performed by Le Formal et al. who invoke the general mechanism in Fig. 6b.43,51,85While proof of a particular mechanism has not yet been obtained, further indirect evidence is provided by observing the macroscopic effects of altering the surface with both catalytic and non-catalytic materials. If the hematite surface is completely coated with another material, there will be no surface iron-based species, which would alter both the kinetics and mechanism of water oxidation and recombination. It is straightforward to interpret the improved performance observed upon adding catalytic coatings to the hematite surface by invoking either mechanism since water oxidation would be expected to be accelerated relative to recombination, thus increasing water oxidation efficiency. It is not straightforward, however, to separate the effect of an increased rate of water oxidation, a decreased rate of recombination, or a combination of the two. The mechanism depicted in Fig. 6b more readily explains the improved performance upon adding non-catalytic coatings, such as aluminum oxide, to the hematite surface, since surface-state recombination would be reduced without necessarily affecting water oxidation. However, the mechanism in Fig. 6a cannot be ruled out. Thus, while the mechanism of water oxidation with bare and coated hematite electrodes is clearly important in understanding the behavior of these electrodes and improving their performance, several open questions remain. Work is ongoing in our lab to determine the details of the water oxidation mechanism.AcknowledgementsTWH thanks the National Science Foundation (CHE-1150378) and the Donors of the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund (51099-DNI10) for support of this research.ReferencesN.

 	Fig. 2  J–V response for thin-film hematite under 1 sun illumination as a working electrode for a fast hole collector [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− (orange) and H2O (red). Photoanodes were illuminated through the substrate side. Reproduced with permission from ref. 43.	 

 	Fig. 3  Relationship between J–V curve (green solid line), surface state capacitance, Css (orange triangles) and charge transfer resistance, Rct,ss (red circles) values obtained under 1 sun illumination at pH 6.9 for a planar 60 nm thick hematite electrode. Impedance data was fit using an equivalent circuit model. Reproduced with permission from ref. 47.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Absorption signal of generated surface species from light (dashed) and potential (solid) modulated absorbance spectroscopy is shown. Reproduced with permission from ref. 39. (b) Change in absorbance of hematite photoanodes at various applied biases in the range of 0.7–1.6 V relative to 0.6 V versus RHE is shown. Reproduced with permission from ref. 48.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Transient absorption signals probed at 650 nm for various applied biases in 0.1 V increments from −0.4 to +0.6 versus SSC for Si-doped α-Fe2O3 electrode. The arrow indicates increasing number of long-lived holes with increasing positive bias.

 	Fig. 8  Electronic absorption spectra of [FeIIIB*(H2O)]− (dashed line), the diiron(IV) dimer (dotted line) and [FeVB*(O)]−, (solid line). Inset: iron(III)-aqua complex, [FeIIIB*(H2O)]−, where the free-base H4B* tetraamide is 3,3,6,6,9,9-hexamethyl-3,4,8,9-tetrahydro-1H-1,4,8,11-benzotetraazacyclotridecine-2,5,7,10(6H,11H)-tetraone. Reproduced with permission from ref. 80.	 

 	Fig. 9  Proposed mechanism for water oxidation on a cobalt-modified hematite electrode. (S0 to S4): adjacent Co centers capture four photogenerated holes paired with deprotonation of the surface hydroxyl groups generates a high valent CoIV with attached oxo group. An O–O bond and a peroxo intermediate (S4′) is formed following nucleophilic attack from a hydroxide on a single CoIVO. O2 is generated after a hydrogen transfer to the second CoIVO. The catalytic cycle is closed upon rehydroxylation of the dangling CoII coordination site by the electrolyte. A similar mechanism can be postulated with Fe in place of Co. Reproduced with permission from ref. 34.	 

 	Fig. 10  Proposed mechanism of Co-Pi films involving the generation of two neighboring CoIV-oxo species. Reproduced with permission from ref. 97.
