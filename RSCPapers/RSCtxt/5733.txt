    , Accepted 24th May 2023First published on 24th May 2023AbstractSolar energy has the potential to be the next-generation power source if the intermittent nature can be overcome via rational energy storage engineering. The competitiveness of solar rechargeable batteries can be further enhanced if the demand for multiple energy storage scenarios can be met within one device. Moreover, active electrochemical materials with different energy storage types are the critical component of this energy storage system. In this work, dual-duty electrochemical functional materials were introduced to guide multi-scene solar energy storage device design and fabrication. Furthermore, dual-duty NiCo2S4 nanosheets were prepared and applied to solar rechargeable batteries. A photo-assisted aqueous polysulfide/iodide flow battery was designed and fabricated with a charging voltage as low as 0.05 V, showing the good electrocatalytic performance of NiCo2S4 nanosheets for aqueous redox couples. Moreover, the low charging voltage leads to 93.5% of input electric energy saving under one sun illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). On the other hand is the photo-assisted sodium-ion battery with a NiCo2S4 anode, showing a remarkably low charging voltage of 0.67 V and a high discharge medium voltage of 1.05 V. The battery can save about 67.6% of input electric energy under 1 sun illumination.
1. Introduction
As absolutely clean and inexhaustible renewable energy, solar energy shows excellent potential to be the mainstream energy source of the future.1 Although considerable achievements have been made in photovoltaic and solar thermal systems, the intermittent nature of solar radiation weakens the competitiveness of solar energy.2,3 The integration of energy storage engineering will lead people into the age of green power.4–6 The electrochemical energy storage system has many advantages such as compact structure, resistance to geographical conditions, fast response, and high conversion efficiency.7–9 Due to their inherent properties of low cost and high safety, aqueous batteries have gained research interest, and significant progress has been made in the development of aqueous-based zinc–iodine batteries.10 The theoretical specific capacity (1672 mA h g−1) of sulfur-based aqueous batteries, which also have a low cost, is higher than that of zinc (820 mA h g−1), and has attracted increasing attention and efforts. The most traditional and standard solar energy storage model connects photovoltaic and rechargeable batteries in series with wires. Nevertheless, such a tandem system is only suitable for large-scale energy storage applications, making it inflexible, especially for innovative consumer electronics and electric vehicles.11 Therefore, a considerable part of the research is devoted to designing an integrated three-electrode photoelectrochemical energy storage system.5 The working principle of this three-electrode system is based on the effective redox cycle of photo-generated electrons or holes. In this three-electrode system, the potential energy matching of each part is necessary.12 Most focus on improving the photoelectrode and electrochemical components’ conversion efficiency or output power.13–15 As far as we can see, although the performance of power batteries is quite good, their cost and safety do not meet the requirements of the energy storage market in the short term.16 Flexible switching between high voltage output for a short time and a safe power supply for a long time is a feasible solution to optimize energy storage systems. Especially for integrated small-scale solar energy storage systems, good adaptability to multi-scenarios is the core competitiveness. This work introduces the concept of dual-duty electrochemical active materials to guide the design and fabrication of multi-scene solar energy storage devices, unlike bifunctional catalysts in electrocatalysis studies, which have two active sites that can synergistically catalyze the reaction.17,18 Dual-duty electrochemical materials specifically refer to the possession of two different electrochemical properties. The electrochemical energy storage device designed based on this dual-duty material can be switched from a safe aqueous energy storage mode to a high-voltage mode by simple operation.
Metal sulfides have attracted tremendous attention in various electric energy storage systems.19,20 Among the metal sulfides, NiCo2S4 has been synthesized and widely investigated in electro-catalysis and energy storage. In the NiCo2S4 spinel crystal structure, cobalt ions (Co3+ and Co2+) occupy both octahedral and tetrahedral sites, and nickel ions (Ni3+ and Ni2+) are distributed over the octahedral sites with richer redox reactions and ultrahigh electrical conductivity.21–23 Thus, NiCo2S4 is an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution and reduction reactions.24–26 NiCo2S4, with outstanding electrochemical performance, is designed and synthesized for supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries.27 Furthermore, NiCo2S4 also exhibits a high specific capacitance of 748 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 with a conversion reaction mechanism in sodium-ion batteries.28 In this paper, based on all of the merits, NiCo2S4 is selected for the electro-catalysis of polysulfide/iodide and sodium ion storage.
In this work, NiCo2S4 nanosheets were prepared by a two-step hydrothermal process and applied to two kinds of three-electrode systems. The components of batteries are shown in Scheme 1. The photo-assisted aqueous polysulfide/iodide flow battery consists of a TiO2 photoelectrode, a NiCo2S4 cathode/anode, an iodide-based catholyte, and a polysulfide-based anolyte, delivering a charging voltage of 0.05 V and 93.5% saving of input electric energy. Furthermore, a photo-assisted sodium-ion battery with the NiCo2S4 anode is proposed, including a dye-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode, an iodide-based catholyte, and a NiCo2S4 cathode/anode. Under 1 sun illumination, the charging voltage of the battery is reduced to 0.67 V, realizing a 67.6% saving of input electric energy. Upon illumination, photo-generated holes oxidize I− into I3− by working on the charging mode. Meanwhile, S42− ions or NiCo2S4 are reduced by photo-generated electrons on the counter electrode. The photovoltage generated on the photoelectrode compensates for the battery's charging voltage. As presented in Scheme 1, the photo-assisted charging voltage equals the energy difference between the redox potential of S42−/S22− (NaxNiCo2S4/NiCo2S4) and the conduction band (CB) of the photoelectrode. During discharging in the darkness, the oxidation of S22− or NaxNiCo2S4 is operated. I3− is reduced on the other side at the same time. Due to the existence of NiCo2S4 nanosheets, the redox reaction kinetics of polysulfides are accelerated, and photo-generated electrons are effectively used to reduce S42−. It was found that the NiCo2S4 nanosheets successfully store sodium ions during the photo-assisted charging process.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Structure and morphology of NiCo2S4 nanosheets
A two-step hydrothermal process was used to prepare the NiCo2S4 nanosheets. The formation of the pure-phase NiCo2S4 nanosheets was confirmed with the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 1a). The diffraction peaks appearing at 26.85°, 31.64°, 38.31°, 50.46°, and 55.34° correspond to the (220), (311), (400), (511), and (440) indices of NiCo2S4 nanosheets (JCPDS # 20-0782). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) illustrates that the NiCo2S4 nanosheets inherit the layered morphology of their LDH precursors after the sulfuration progress (Fig. 2). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) images of the NiCo2S4 nanosheets exhibit (220) and (311) crystal plane fringes (Fig. 1b). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and the relevant elemental mappings are shown in Fig. S1,† illustrating the coexistence of Ni, Co, and S in the synthetic samples.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra are displayed in Fig. S2,† which demonstrate the existence of Ni, Co, and S elements in the NiCo2S4 nanosheets. In the case of the Ni 2p spectrum, two spin–orbit doublets are visible at 853.2/870.9 eV and 856.5/874.6 eV, implying the coexistence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ ions. Concerning the Co 2p spectrum, the bands centered at 780.5/797.1 eV can be attributed to Co2+ ions and those at 778.2/793.2 eV are assigned to Co3+ ions. The S 2p spectrum at 161.5 and 162.6 eV can be ascribed to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, respectively. The S 2p spectrum at 163.8 eV is derived from the metal–sulfur (M–S) bond in the NiCo2S4 nanosheets, which is consistent with the previously reported values for NiCo2S4 nanosheets.25 The above-mentioned tests are consistent with the characteristics of the NiCo2S4 nanosheet phase.
2.2. Electrocatalytic activity of NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrodes
The electrocatalytic properties of the iodide and the polysulfide redox couples are studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Higher peak current density shows that the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode is more effective than the carbon paper (CP) electrode for the electrochemical reaction of I3−/I− (Fig. 3a). In Fig. 3b, the yellow curve exhibits two pairs of redox peaks (−0.62/−0.35 V, −0.91/−0.58 V vs. SCE). The former corresponds to the redox reaction of S42−/S22−, while the latter is related to other polysulfide ions.29 In contrast, there is no redox peak during CP as the working electrode. The NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode has excellent electrocatalytic capacity for the redox reaction of iodide and polysulfide. In addition, linear sweep voltammetry curves for different working electrodes were performed, as shown in Fig. 3c, and the parameters are summarized in Table S1.† The NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode exhibits the maximum current density at −0.66 V (vs. SCE) in a 1 M Na2S4 solution, indicating that the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode is dominant in the redox reaction of polysulfide ions and has little effect on hydrogen evolution reactions. Electrochemical activity-specific surface area (ECSA) is one of the parameters for evaluating the activities of electrocatalysts. The NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode and CP electrode were tested to obtain the ESCA value in the NaCl solution, as shown in Fig. S3.† After linear fitting, the ESCA value of the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode and CP electrodes were calculated to be 4.37 and 1.08 mF cm−2, as shown in Fig. 3d. Therefore, the above-mentioned tests confirm that the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode has excellent electrocatalytic performance for S42−/S22− and I3−/I− redox reactions.

(c) LSV curves of the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode and CP electrode in different electrolytes. (d) Current density vs. scan rate curves and corresponding linear fitting results. 
2.3. Photo-assisted aqueous polysulfide/iodide flow batteries
Due to these excellent electrochemical properties, the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode is assembled into flow batteries as the cathode/anode to explore the battery performance. The galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling of the aqueous polysulfide/iodide flow battery is shown in Fig. 4a. The CP electrode was used for comparison at 1 mA cm−2, showing a discharge-specific capacity of 4.49 mA h g−1. The aqueous polysulfide/iodide flow battery with the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode delivers a discharge-specific capacity of 52.28 mA h g−1 at 10 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. 4b, the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode has a lower charge transfer resistance (Rct), which ensures a more efficient electron transfer process at the electrode/electrolyte interface, thus facilitating the corresponding electrochemical reaction. Combining the reduction and oxidation peak potential at 5 mV s−1 sweeping rate, the theoretical operating voltage of 0.93 V was obtained based on the following reaction (Fig. 4c): Catholyte : 3I− ⇌ I3− + 2e−(1) Anolyte : S42− + 2e− ⇌ S22−(2)

After 30 cycles for 60 h, the battery keeps 0.77 V of charge voltage and 0.45 V of constant discharge voltage with the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode (Fig. 4d). The CP electrode shows a higher charge voltage and a lower discharge voltage under the same current density. The result displays excellent long-term cycling stability and higher voltage efficiency value (VE = Vdischarge/Vcharge) of the NiCo2S4 nanosheets, further presenting the superiority of the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode with potential application for photo-assisted aqueous polysulfide/iodide flow batteries.
TiO2 was introduced as a photoelectrode for a photo-assisted aqueous polysulfide/iodide flow battery to achieve a photo-assisted charging process, as shown in Scheme 1. The band gap and flat band potential of TiO2 were obtained from the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and the Mott–Schottky equation (Fig. S4†). The band gap of TiO2 is approximately 3 eV, and ECB was estimated to be −0.5 V (vs. SCE). According to the difference between the redox couple potential of S42−/S22− and the ECB of TiO2, the theoretical bias voltage of the battery was calculated to be 0.05 V.
Under 1 sun illumination, the photo-assisted charging voltage is about 0.05 V at a current density of 0.01 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 5a, which matches well with the theoretical bias voltage. The lower charging voltage can lead to higher input electric energy saving and alleviate the electrochemical decomposition of other battery components such as electrolytes and electrodes. The charging voltage is 0.77 V in the darkness, meaning more power input. In Fig. S5,† the absorption bands of triiodide species (288 nm and 350 nm) increase, indicating that iodide ions are oxidized to triiodide ions by photo-generated holes. The UV-Vis spectra show an increase in S22− (300 nm). This suggested that the S42− was reduced to S22− by photo-generated electrons. Moreover, the discharge voltage of the CP electrode (the gray curve) is much lower than that of the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode at a current density of 0.01 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 5b. The result indicates that the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode can collect photo-generated electrons and facilitate the corresponding electrocatalytic reaction. As shown in Fig. 5c, the initial charging voltage remains stable at 0.05 ± 0.01 V for at least 14 cycles. The photo-assisted aqueous polysulfide/iodide flow battery also demonstrates good cycling ability. Moreover, the main phase and the morphology of NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrodes after the cycling test was not changed significantly, as shown in Fig. S6,† indicating the robust stability of the structure of NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrodes.

2.4. Photo-assisted sodium-ion battery with NiCo2S4 anodes
In the above-mentioned work, the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode catalyzes polysulfide and iodine in an aqueous electrolyte. However, the materials based on Co and Ni elements are also widely investigated as high-performance hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution catalysts, which are harmful to aqueous-based energy devices.30 Thus, organic electrolytes such as propylene carbonate replace aqueous electrolytes. In Fig. 6a, two pairs of redox peaks are observed (0.04/0.2 V, 0.52/0.68 V vs. Ag/AgCl), and the current density of the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode is higher than that of the CP electrode. The NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode also has excellent catalytic ability for the redox reaction of iodine in propylene carbonate.
 Fig. 6  (a) CV curves of 0.2 M NaI/1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and (b) CV curves of the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode at 0.1 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V. 
To evaluate the sodiation/dissociation of the NiCo2S4 nanosheets, a half-cell configuration was assembled to concentrate on the distinct electrochemical properties of NiCo2S4 nanosheets. The CV plots of the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode with a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 6b. The peak located at 0.65 V (vs. Na/Na+) can be attributed to the growth of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during the first cathodic scan.22 The peak located at −1.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) can be attributed to the intercalation of Na+ into the NiCo2S4 lattice.
To save more input electric energy, the NiCo2S4 nanosheets take the place of polysulfides as energy storage electrodes in propylene carbonate. The catholyte is still NaI in propylene carbonate. The photoelectrode of the system is TiO2/N719 dye instead of TiO2 nanorod arrays. The battery reaction is described as follows: Catholyte:3I− ⇌ I3− + 2e−(3) Anode:NiCo2S4 + xNa+ + xe− ⇌ NaxNiCo2S4(4)
In the above-mentioned analysis, the theoretical charging voltage is about 1.65 V (the difference of the redox couple potential of I3−/I− and NiCo2S4/NaxNiCo2S4). The repeated electric energy storage/delivery curves of the designed sodium ion battery without any photoelectrode are shown in Fig. 7a. The charging voltage plateau is 2.07 V at 0.2 mA cm−2 in the darkness, which gradually decreases to 1.05 V at 0.1 mA cm−2 during discharging. In Fig. 7b, compared to the other conditions, NiCo2S4 nanosheets as the cathode/anode have charge voltage and discharge voltage in NaClO4 electrolytes (red line), indicating that the sodium storage electrode (NiCo2S4) and appropriate electrolyte (NaClO4) are indispensable to storing sodium ions. Under illumination, the photo-assisted sodium-ion battery with the NiCo2S4 anode achieves a charging voltage of 0.67 V, resulting in a 67.6% saving of electric energy (Fig. 7c). As shown in Fig. S7 and Table S2,† the existence of sodium ions after charging for 1.5 h indicates that the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode can realize the storage of sodium ions. In the photo-assisted charging process, a pronounced shift of the (311) indices of NiCo2S4 to lower angles was observed, attributed to the intercalation of Na-ions and expansion of the NiCo2S4 lattice spacings (Fig. S8†). The phenomenon is consistent with the previously reported results.23 Additionally, the evolution of Ni 2p XPS peaks confirms the reversible electrochemical reduction of NiCo2S4 photo-assisted charge/discharge. During the photo-assisted charge process, the Ni2+ signal intensifies and the Ni3+ signal weakens. Upon discharge, the Ni 2p spectra were fully reversed, approaching the case at the pristine state. Simultaneously, the Co 2p spectra show a similar trend (Fig. S9†). This suggests that NiCo2S4 has good reversibility based on electrochemistry. EDS, XRD and XPS confirm that the sodiation/desodiation process of NiCo2S4 is reversible. These tests further confirm that the NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode can realize the storage of sodium ions. The photo-assisted charging and discharging curves maintain their identity for three cycles (Fig. 7d), demonstrating the achievement of reversible photo-assisted charging, energy output and relatively good cycling stability.

Nowadays, more efforts have been devoted to various open-type and closed-type photo-enhanced rechargeable metal batteries.31 Dual-duty NiCo2S4 nanosheets for solar rechargeable batteries exhibit the excellent performance of solar energy storage with the advantages of remarkably low charging voltage, higher discharging capacity, relative safety, and simplified design. Specially, an ultralow charging voltage of 0.05 V/0.67 V is lower than that of most photo-enhanced rechargeable metal batteries, but the cycle number of our system is not the best. NiCo2S4 nanosheets as sodium ion storage electrodes show obvious polarization and overpotential during the discharging process, as shown in Fig. 7a and d, owing to the slower reaction kinetics of the sodiation/desodiation reaction. We believe that the integrated solar rechargeable batteries will be the next-generation power source with more efforts devoted.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, solar rechargeable batteries based on dual-duty transition metal sulfide have been successfully fabricated, which fulfill multi-scene solar energy storage and conversion. In the aqueous electrolyte working mode, the dual-duty NiCo2S4 nanosheet electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for polysulfide/iodide. The charging voltage of the photo-assisted aqueous polysulfide/iodide flow battery is reduced to 0.05 V, showing good stability for at least 14 cycles. After replacing the electrolyte with the organic electrolyte for sodium ion storage, a battery with a median discharge voltage of 1.05 V can be obtained. In addition, the charging voltage of the photo-assisted sodium-ion battery with the NiCo2S4 anode is reduced from 2.07 V to 0.67 V. However, the cycle number of our solar rechargeable battery is not the best. Two stratagems can improve the cycle life, including (i) the addition of a physical protective barrier between the electrolyte and the photoelectrode and (ii) the deposition of catalysts on the surface of the photoelectrode to accelerate the redox reactions. Compared with other photoelectrochemical energy storage research, our devices’ photon-to-electron conversion efficiency and output power are not the best. The most exciting part of our work is demonstrating the flexibility of integrated small-scale solar energy storage devices for complex energy supply scenarios, guided by the concept of advanced dual-duty electrochemical active materials. This concept holds great promise for inspiring the design of solar energy utilization devices.

Preparation of NiCo–LDH precursors
NiCo–LDH was prepared by a sample solvothermal method. First, 0.298 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.592 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and 0.6 g HMT were dissolved in 30 ml MeOH with continuous magnetic stirring to obtain a clear solution. The mixed solution was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon autoclave. Second, a piece of CP (1 cm × 1 cm) was immersed in the reaction solution to serve as a growth substrate. The autoclave was heated in an oven at 180 °C for 8 h. Third, after cooling to room temperature, the CP covered with NiCo–LDH was washed several times with deionized water and ethanol and then dried at 60 °C for 24 h to remove the adsorbed water.

The sulfide precursor solution and the previous step of CP were transferred into a 100 ml Teflon autoclave. Then, the autoclave was heated in an oven at 150 °C for 6 h. The product was cleaned three times with deionized water and ethanol after cooling to room temperature. Finally, the NiCo2S4 electrode was dried in a vacuum-drying oven overnight.

Design and fabrication of photo-assisted aqueous polysulfide/iodide flow batteries and aqueous polysulfide/iodide flow batteries
The system of photo-assisted aqueous polysulfide/iodide flow battery included TiO2 electrode/0.15 M NaI/NiCo2S4/Nafion 117/0.05 M Na2S4/NiCo2S4. Before cell assembly, commercial Nafion 117 was pretreated by immersion in 80 °C5 wt% H2O2 for 1 h, deionized water for 30 min, 80 °C5 wt% H2SO4 for 1 h, and deionized water for 30 min successively. The catholyte used 5 ml 0.15 M NaI and 1 M NaCl. The anolyte used the same volume of 0.05 M Na2S4 prepared as follows: 0.05 M Na2S·9H2O was dissolved in 1 M NaCl under stirring and then 0.15 M S was added into this solution. The anolyte (0.05 M Na2S4 solution) was obtained after 8 h stirring. The only difference was that the aqueous polysulfide/iodide flow battery did not require the TiO2 photoelectrode.
Design and fabrication of photo-assisted sodium-ion battery with the NiCo2S4 anode
The system of photo-assisted sodium-ion battery with the NiCo2S4 anode mainly included Dye N719–TiO2 electrode/0.2 M NaI/NiCo2S4/Nafion 117/NiCo2S4. The catholyte and anolyte used 1 M NaClO4 dissolved in PC instead of 1 M NaCl. At the same time, the Na2S4 solution was replaced with NiCo2S4 immersed in 1 M NaClO4 as the anode.

The cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry test, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and A.C. impedance (EIS) measurements were recorded using a Chenhua 760E electrochemical working station (Shanghai, China). Three electrodes were adopted for electrochemical measurements, namely, NiCo2S4, a SCE, and a Pt wire as the working, reference, and counter electrodes. Galvanostatic charge–discharge processes were carried out using a Wuhan Land Electronics (China) at different current densities, recording currents and voltages.
