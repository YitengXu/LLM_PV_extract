    , Accepted 12th August 2022First published on 12th August 2022AbstractThe low photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) of perovskite Rb2SnCl6 severely limits its commercial development in optics, although it has perfect environmental stability and lead-free toxicity. Here, Te4+ substituted lead-free double perovskite Rb2SnCl6 microcrystals (MCs) are synthesized successfully by using the solvothermal method, which have a bright broad-band emission and large Stokes shift. The band gaps of Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 calculated by density functional theory (DFT) are close to the corresponding experimental band gaps. It is verified by DFT that partial Te4+ substitution causes the Rb2SnCl6 from the direct band gap to the indirect band gap. Temperature-dependent steady-state and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra as well as absorption spectra reveal that the broad-band emission at 560 nm is attributed to self-trapped excitons (STEs). Then, the PL lifetime of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs is first used to measure temperature in a wide temperature range. The maximum value of relative sensitivity (SR) obtained at the temperature from 355 to 370 K is 4.4% K−1, and the maximum value of absolute sensitivity (SA) obtained at 320 K is 28.23 ns K−1 from the calculation of the PL lifetime. PL lifetime measurements are not affected by sample size, excitation source power, and whether the luminous centers are uniformly distributed. The calculated data highlights the higher sensitivity optical thermometry of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs. Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs combined with a commercial LED chip are successfully fabricated for the white light emitting diode (WLED). The correlated color temperature (CCT) of the WLED can be adjusted from 3582 to 5164 K by controlling the current. In summary, this research shows that Te4+ substituted Rb2SnCl6 double perovskite MCs exhibit great prospects in optical thermometry and tunable solid-state lighting.
1. Introduction
Lead halide perovskites APbX3 (A = Cs+, CH3NH3+, or CH(NH2)2+; X = Cl−, Br−, or I−) have attracted the interest of the researchers due to their high PLQY,1 strong spin–orbit coupling, low-cost method preparation,2 and adjustable wavelength emission.3 Because of these advantages, lead halide perovskites have great applicable prospects in LEDs,4,5 photodetectors,6,7 solar cells,8etc. However, the lead-based perovskites are extremely easy to degrade their structures in long-term exposure to air, water, and/or oxygen, which show poor stability and lead-containing toxicity. The toxicity of lead can permanently damage human intelligence, and the poor stability severely restricts its commercial applications.9 Therefore, the exploration of stable and highly luminescent materials that are based on lead-free perovskites has attracted widespread attention.
Based on the toxicity of lead, the researchers consider partial or total replacement Pb2+ with the metal ions that have the same valence state,10,11 such as Ge2+, Sn2+ and Zn2+. Although replacing Pb2+ with other ions can reduce the toxicity of the material, it also seriously affects the optical properties of this material, such as the most obvious lower photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY).12 A series of perovskite derivatives that are named double perovskite have emerged with excellent environmental stability, which they can not only solve the toxicity of lead-based perovskites but also hold similar optoelectronic properties compared with typical APbX3. This type of double perovskite structure is formed by the co-substitution of monovalent/trivalent (Cs2M1M3X6, M1 = Ag+, or Na+; M3 = In3+, or Bi3+)13–15 or tetravalent/vacancy (Cs2M4X6, M4 = Sn4+,16 Te4+,17 Pd4+18 or Zr4+19) elements for the B site. Although the double perovskite material shows good environmental stability, it still needs to be replaced with some elements to improve its optical performance. The substitution of the B site in A2BX6 double perovskite, especially the partial substitution with M4+, can effectively change the parity-forbidden transition as well as the width of the band gap.20–22 Mn-doped Cs2Na1−xAgxBiCl6 microcrystals (MCs) double perovskites show impressive energy transfer-mediated STEs emission.23 By partial substitution with Ag+–Na+ and Bi3+–In3+ in the same valence, Tang et al. have reported that Cs2Ag0.6Na0.4In1−xBixCl6 triggered the parity forbidden transition to the parity allowed transition24 and PLQY reached 86%. Thereafter, the Cs2Sn1−xTexCl6 solid solutions with the high anti-water stability and PLQY are prepared by the same group.21 In addition to being used to encapsulate WLEDs,25 the changed PL lifetime with increasing temperature can be used for optical PL temperature measurement in the application of Sn-based double perovskites. And, it is still relatively rare to use PL lifetime changes to achieve temperature measurement in Sn-based double perovskites.
In this work, a range of lead-free all-inorganic vacancy-ordered perovskite Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 MCs have been prepared successfully by the solvothermal method. Partial substitution of Te4+ has enhanced the PLQY of Rb2SnCl6 greatly. Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs have a 560 nm emission peak, of which PLQY reaches 60% at room temperature. The luminous mechanism of Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 MCs has been explored by the temperature-dependent steady-state PL and TRPL. The PL lifetime shows a gradual decrease with the change of temperature, which makes it consider to be applied to the PL lifetime temperature measurement. Considering exciton binding energy and Huang–Rhys factor calculated by theoretical fitting, the tunable cold and warm WLEDs have been fabricated successfully, of which the correlated color temperature (CCT) can be adjusted from 3698 to 6650 K.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Basic optical and structural characterization
Rb2SnCl6 MCs do not contain the toxicity of lead and exhibit good stability, but their poor optical properties seriously influence the exploration of lighting applications.26 The photoelectric properties of Rb2SnCl6 MCs are improved through partial substitution Sn4+ of Rb2SnCl6 with Te4+. As shown in Fig. 1(a), it exhibits the vacancy-ordered crystal structure27 of Rb2SnxTe1−xCl6, which is partially substituted octahedral from [TeCl6]2− to [SnCl6]2− due to the Te doping. Sn4+ and Te4+ ions have a similar ionic radius and coordination properties,28 which make Sn4+ of Rb2SnCl6 easy to be substituted with Te4+. And the insets of Fig. 1(a) show the photos of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs under daylight and UV light. Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs display translucent pale-yellow under daylight and show obvious yellow emission under UV light.

(f) XPS spectra for Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs. 
As shown in Fig. 1(b), the absorption edges in the absorption spectra are observed to gradually redshift from 400 to 500 nm with the slow increase of the Te4+ substitution content. Rb2SnCl6 MCs have strong absorption in the range of 200–300 nm, and then, the absorption afterward shows a cliff-like decline. Therefore, the absorption of Rb2SnCl6 MCs shows a weaker absorption when compared with Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 MCs in 300–500 nm. Similar to the previously reported research,29 the absorption of 300–360 nm and 380–500 nm is significantly enhanced with an increase in Te4+ substitution content. And, Rb2TeCl6 merges the two absorption regions into a 200–500 nm absorption region. The absorption spectra can be converted to the band gap through the Tauc-plot formula,30 (hνα)1/n = A(hν − Eg)(1)where α represents the absorption coefficient, hν is on behalf of the photon energy, A represents the proportional constant, and Eg is the band gap. When n = 1/2 is applied to the direct band gap and n = 2 is applied to the indirect band gap, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the width of the band gap decreases from 2.56 to 2.28 eV with the increase of Te4+ substitution. Because Te4+ (0.97 Å) has a larger ionic radius than Sn4+ (0.69 Å), the PL emission peaks have a slight redshift from 560 to 580 nm which is consistent with the previous report21 with the increase of Te4+ substitution. The expansion of Te–Cl bonds and the strain change of [TeCl6]2− substitution have important influence factors in the redshift.31 In order to determine whether the structure of Rb2SnCl6 changes under different Te4+ substitution contents, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 MCs have been exhibited in Fig. 1(c). In the case of slight substitution, the XRD diffraction peaks of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs are basically unchanged compared with Rb2SnCl6. Through the analysis of diffraction angles ranging from 34.5 to 36°, it is found that the diffraction peak (400) has a significant blue shift with the increase of Te4+ substitution, which means that Te4+ ions are doped successfully into the Rb2SnCl6 host matrix. The lattice is expanded and makes the diffraction peak move to a lower angle when larger ions are embedded in the crystal lattice. The diffraction peaks of Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 (x = 1) MCs and Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 (x = 0) MCs match well with the standard card JCPDF # 75-0373 (Rb2TeCl6) and # 07-0208 (Rb2SnCl6), and it is indicated that there are no impurities in the target product. Based on the higher PLQY value, Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs are selected as the research object in the series of Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 MCs as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). In order to clarify the element content ratio and their valences, the energy dispersive X-ray energy spectrum (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs have been measured. Fig. 1(d) shows the EDS of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs, and the substitution content can be easily measured because Sn4+ has the same valence state and a similar radius as Te4+. And, the measurement ratio is Rb:Sn:Te:Cl ≈ 2.00:0.95:0.05:6.00, which is very close to the feeding ratio. As shown in Fig. 1(e), it can be concluded that the distribution of each element is very uniform from the observation of the EDS mappings, and the size of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs ranges from 5 to 50 μm. Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 MCs are prepared by the solvothermal method;32 the size of Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 MCs can increase as the cooling rate slows down during the solvothermal synthesis. And as shown in Fig. S3(a) (ESI†), the binding energy of 577.08 eV corresponds to the Te4+ 3d3/2 peak and the binding energy of 588.08 eV corresponds to the Te4+ 3d5/2 peak. The peak located at 497.08 is attributed to Sn4+ 3d3/2 and the peak located at 488.08 eV is attributed to Sn4+ 3d5/2 after fitting as shown in Fig. S3(b) (ESI†). The corresponding peaks of the elements are consistent with those of Cs2Sn1−xTexCl621 and Rb2SnCl6.26 The XPS in Fig. 1(f) and Fig. S3 (ESI†) points out that each element has reached a relatively stable valence state, causing Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 MCs to exhibit a stable structure.
2.2. Steady-state temperature-dependent PL spectra
In order to explore the PL emission of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6, a low-temperature cryostat and spectrometer are assembled to collect the variable-temperature PL spectra from 80 to 380 K. What can be clearly seen in Fig. 2(a) is the PL intensity rapidly increasing as the temperature decreases due to the nonradiative recombination being inhibited. It is because the coupling between phonons and excitons is reduced, and the interaction between phonons and electrons is enhanced in a lower-temperature environment.28 The pseudocolor map of normalized PL intensity in the inset of Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows that the emission peak has a blue shift of 10 nm with temperature increasing from 80 to 380 K, which is similar to the Pb-based perovskite. The temperature dependence of the integrated emission intensity I(T) can be described as follows: (2)From the equation, I0 represents the integrated emission intensity at 0 K. A0 is a fitting parameter, Eb is the exciton binding energy, and kB represents the Boltzmann constant. As can be seen from the bottom of Fig. 2(b), the Eb that have obtained by fitting the experimental data is 161.5 meV, which is larger than that of lead halide perovskites,33 such as 51.2–96.0 meV for CsPbI3.34 The correlation coefficient (R2) is 0.96, which indicates that the fitted line is consistent with the experimental data at 80–380 K. The PL emission intensity of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs becomes weak gradually with the increase of temperature, but the full width at half maximum (FWHM) displays a gradually increasing trend. The temperature dependence of the FWHM is fitted with the following equation of phonon broadening mode:35 (3)where ℏωphonon represents the phonon energy (ℏ, reduced Planck constant, ωphonon, phonon frequency), S is the electron–phonon coupling parameter, and T is the temperature. The S is 19.3 through fitting the temperature-dependent FWHM, which indicates a strong electron–phonon coupling in the soft halide matrix.29 ℏωphonon obtained from the phonon broadening model is 9.12 meV, which is in good agreement with the experimental data at the temperature from 80 to 380 K.

(b) The FWHM and normalized PL intensity of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs at 80–380 K. (c and d) PL spectra of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs at 405 nm CW laser and 800 nm femtosecond excitation at different pump fluence at 80 K, and the insets are the linear fitting between PL intensity and pump fluence. (e) The PLQY measurement spectra of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs, and the inset is the picture under daylight and UV light. (f) DSC and TGA curves of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs. 
As shown in Fig. 2(c), PL spectra of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs have been collected at the 405 nm continuous-wave (CW) laser under different laser pump fluences. PL emission intensity increases with the enhancement of laser power from 50 to 5729 mW cm−2, and the effect of pump fluence on PL intensity is shown in the inset of Fig. 2(c). The solid blue line is the linear fitting curve with the integral intensity at the peak positions of 560 nm and the correlation coefficient (R2) is 0.99 and the slope of the blue solid line is 1.03. The parameter of linear fitting curves demonstrates the existence of single-photon excitation. Femtosecond excitation at 800 nm has been used to demonstrate the upconversion luminescent properties of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the peak position of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs is observed at 565 nm under the 800 nm femtosecond excitation. Compared with 405 nm excitation, the Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs peak position of 800 nm femtosecond excitation has a 5 nm red shift. A similar red-shift phenomenon occurs in lead halide perovskites33 under femtosecond excitation at 800 nm. As can be seen from the data in the inset of Fig. 2(d), the red dashed line represents the linear fitting curve of the relationship between PL intensity and pump fluence and exhibits a slope of 1.56, which implies the presence of two-photon absorption induced luminescence of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs. The PLQY of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs reaches to 60% through three times measurement in Fig. 2(e), and the insets show the pictures of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs under daylight and UV light. The thermal stability of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs is assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. 2(f), the DSC shows that thermal decomposition starts at 341 °C, and the TGA indicates a high remaining weight of 95% at 480 °C.
2.3. Temperature-dependent TRPL and its optical thermometry
The TRPL decay curves have been measured with a frequency-adjustable 405 nm picosecond (ps) pulse laser, and the PL spectra have been collected using a spectrometer with an intensified CCD to explore the luminescent mechanism. The PL decay curves of vacancy-ordered perovskite Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 MCs are shown in Fig. 3(a). The more Sn4+ replaced by Te4+, the shorter the average lifetime of Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 became. The decay curve of Cs2SnxTe1−xCl6 can be fitted by the decay function, I(t) = A1 + B1e−t/τ1 + C1e−t/τ2(4)where I(t) is the PL intensity at time t. A1 represents the PL baseline, and B1 and C1 represent the amplitudes of PL. τ1 represents the intersystem crossing (ISC) process from the singlet 1P1 relax to the triplet 3P1, and τ2 represents the lifetime of radiative transition from 3P1 to 1S036 of 560 nm emission. In order to compare the PL lifetime, the average lifetime (τaver) is calculated through the function, τaver = (Bτ12 + Cτ22)/(Bτ1 + Cτ2)(5)
 Fig. 3  (a) TRPL decays of Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 at 295 K. (b and c) Temperature-dependent TRPL decays of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs from 100 to 300 K and 300 to 400 K. (d) TRPL spectra Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs from 0.36 to 4.62 μs at 295 K. (e) The SA and SR value of 560 nm emission from 100 to 300 K (lower half) and 300 to 400 K (upper half). (f) The lifetime of 560 nm emission from 100 to 400 K for three cycles. 
The average lifetime decays from 1925 to 596 ns as x (Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6) increases.
Temperature-dependent TRPL curves of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs are shown in Fig. 3(b and c). It can be very clearly analyzed that the PL lifetime shows a gradient decline as the temperature increases from 100 to 300 K and 300 to 400 K. The PL spectra decay process of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs from 0.36 to 4.62 μs is shown in Fig. 3(d). It can be distinguished clearly that the process of PL intensity decreases slowly with the rise of the number of frames. The lifetime of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs can be reduced from 4150 to 39 ns when temperature is increased from 100 to 400 K, which shows an evident gradual decrease. Therefore, it can be considered to be applied to optical PL lifetime temperature measurement.37 The great significance for temperature sensing of optical thermometers is the sensitivity, and the important parameters to evaluate the pros and cons of thermometric materials are SR and SA. SA represents the change in the PL lifetime of the material per unit temperature change, and SR is defined as the relative percentage change, all of which are calculated, respectively, by the following equations as (6) (7) (8)where τ′ and  are the lifetime of T and 0 K, and D is a fitting parameter. As the temperature rises, the change tendency of SR and SA is demonstrated as shown in Fig. 3(e). The maximum value of SR is kept to be 4.4% K−1 from 355 to 370 K and 0.526% K−1 at 115 K, which indicates high sensitivity. Compared with the traditional similar fluorescent temperature measuring materials, such as Pr3+-doped NaY(MoO4)2,38 the kind of materials based on Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs shows higher sensitivity. And, the SA shows the same variation tendency, of which the maximum value is 28.23 ns K−1 at 320 K under 300 to 400 K and 20.152 ns K−1 at 100 K under 100 to 300 K. Considering its future commercial application prospects, three repeated tests of the PL lifetime have been carried out, respectively, from 100 to 400 K. As shown in Fig. 3(f), for the result of each temperature cycle, the PL lifetime corresponding to each temperature can be kept similar, and the cyclic tests provide evidence for commercial application prospects in the future.
For further understanding of the optical properties and energy band structures of Te4+ substituted Rb2SnCl6 MCs, we performe DFT calculation on the Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 structure using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package.39 A 4 × 4 × 4 Monk horst Pack grid is set up to simulate the Brillouin zone, where the kinetic energy cut-off is 450 eV and the energy band structure is drawn along the high symmetry K point.40 In Fig. 4(a), it shows that the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are located at the same high symmetry point Γ point, which is a direct observation of the direct band gap with a value of 2.53 eV. Through the absorption spectroscopy, the experimental value of the Rb2SnCl6 MCs band gap is 2.56 eV, which is converted by the Tauc-plot formula. It can be proved that the theoretical calculation results are close to the experimental value. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the theoretical calculation shows that Rb2Sn0.8Te0.2Cl6 has an indirect band structure and its band gap reduces to 2.28 eV, which is close to the experimental value of 2.29 eV. The density of states (DOS) is plotted for total and individual atoms for Rb2SnCl6 and Rb2Sn0.8Te0.2Cl6 MCs, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4(c). The VBM of Rb2SnCl6 MCs is attributed to the 3p orbital of Cl, and the CBM of Rb2SnCl6 MCs consists of both Cl 3p and Sn 5s orbitals. The results show that when Te4+ is doped into Rb2SnCl6, both Te 5s and Cl 3p orbitals have changed the VBM and that makes the band gap of Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 becomes lower.

According to the steady-state PL spectra and TRPL spectra at variable temperatures, the emission mechanism of Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 has been researched. The same as the outer electronic structure of Bi3+41 and Sb3+,42 Te4+ is a typical ion with the outer electronic configuration of 5s2, and the schematic diagram of the energy-transfer model is described in Fig. 4(d). The excited state can be split into a single state 1P1 and a triplet state 3Pn (n = 0, 1, 2), and the ground state is 1S0. It can be arranged as 1P1, 3P2, 3P1, and 3P0 by the excited state energy from high to low through Hund's rules.32 The lattice distortion and Jahn–Teller effect make the broad-band emission and large Stokes shift to be observed. The broad-band 560 nm emission, large Stokes shift, and long decay lifetime indicate that 560 nm emission is consistent with the STEs,43,44 which is similar to the research45 that has been reported. There is a strong absorption around 200–360 nm observed in the absorption spectra of Rb2SnCl6, which is attributed to the absorption from 1S0 to 1P1. After that, the energy from 1P1 relaxes to 3P1 in the triplet state through ISC, and transitions back to the ground state 1S0 by emitting 560 nm STEs emission. And, the weak absorption at 370–500 nm was attributed to 1S0–3P1. The low energy content through ISC and the weak absorption of 370–500 nm make the emission of Rb2SnCl6 MCs very weak. The absorption intensity at 200–360 nm is almost unchanged after substitution of Te4+, but the absorption peak intensity at 370–500 nm sharply increases. Strong absorption can excite more excitons from the ground state 1S0 to the excited state 3P1 with the radiative transition of 560 nm emission. The strong absorption of 370–500 nm enhances the 560 nm emission PL intensity of Te4+ substituted Rb2SnCl6 MCs greatly. The short decay lifetime (τ1) and the long decay lifetime (τ2) of the TRPL spectra further confirm the model in Fig. 4(d).
2.4. Tunable WLEDs and their working stability
The ground Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs are mixed with light-transmitting silica gels A and B, which have been coated with the mixture of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs and silica gels on 430 nm LED chip. And, the prepared LED chip is dried in a vacuum environment for 2 hours. The exciton binding energy and ℏωphonon are obtained through data fitting of variable temperature PL spectra, and all of them prove that its PL intensity is influenced greatly by temperature. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the CIE coordinates of the LED can be altered by adjusting the current. When the current that flows through the LED chip is 80 mA, the CIE coordinates of the WLED is (0.41, 0.42), which shows warm white light with a CCT of 3582 K. When the current increases to 120 mA, the CIE coordinates are (0.39, 0.39), and the WLED shows white light with a CCT of 3889 K. When the current keeps increasing to 180 mA, the CIE coordinates of the WLED is (0.33, 0.31) which shows cool white light with a CCT of 5164 K. The pictures of working WLEDs at different currents are shown in Fig. 5(d). The growth of current realizes the conversion of WLEDs from warm white light to cool white light. The current changes in Fig. 5(b) are the opposite of Fig. 5(a); it shows the PL emission spectra of a WLED that reduces the current from 180 to 80 mA, achieving the purpose of transforming the WLED from cold white light to warm white light. When the LED chip current increases from 80 to 180 mA, the PL intensity of the LED chip increases. At the same time, the larger current flows through the LED chip, the higher the temperature rises in the center of the LED chip and the PL intensity of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs decreases with the increase of temperature. It is the larger current that makes the emission of the WLED weak relatively.
 Fig. 5  (a and b) are the PL emission spectra with LED chip current increasing from 80 to 180 mA and decreasing from 180 to 80 mA. (c) shows the PL spectrum of WLEDs under 120 mA and the WLED emission intensity in 300 min and the inset is cyclic CIE color coordinates of the WLED device. (d) The light-emitting structure diagram of the WLED and the inset shows the pictures of glowing WLEDs. (e) The values of CCT and light efficiency with the current changes. 
In the same way, the temperature at the center of the chip declines and the PL intensity of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs increases when the current decreases. As shown in Fig. 5(e), the PL intensity of the WLED declines with the increase of current, which makes the light efficiency of the WLED decrease. And, the PL intensity of WLEDs enhances with the decrease of current, which makes the light efficiency of the WLED increase. Therefore, the purpose of controlling the current to adjust the CCT can be achieved. The upper inset of Fig. 5(c) shows the PL spectrum of the WLED under a current of 120 mA. The PL intensity is stable at about 87% for 300 min when it is energized, which proves that the light-emitting stability of the WLED is good. The inset in Fig. 5(c) shows the CIE coordinate change graph where the current first increases and then decreases. Therefore, the Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 perovskite exhibits application potential in the field of lighting due to white light of adjustable CCT.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a series of Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 MCs have been prepared successfully through the solvothermal method. Compared with unsubstituted Rb2SnCl6 MCs, Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 MCs have improved greatly the PLQY. Under 405 nm excitation, the PLQY of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs reaches 60% and the emission peak of the PL spectra is displayed at 560 nm. It is concluded that the luminescence of Rb2SnxTe1−xCl6 MCs originates from STEs emission that is analyzed through the temperature-dependent steady-state PL and TRPL. DFT calculation also demonstrates that Te4+ doping makes Rb2SnCl6 transition from the direct band gap to the indirect band gap. This kind of PL lifetime as a function of temperature gradient can be used for temperature measurements. And the PL lifetime of Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs is measured in the temperature range from 100 to 400 K using 405 nm ps laser excitation, and the lifetime shows a gradual decrease with the temperature rising. According to the PL lifetime, the maximum values of SR and SA are 4.4% K−1 from 355 to 370 K and 28.23 ns K−1 at 320 K, respectively. Taking advantage of this trend, WLED devices that can control cold and warm white light by controlling the current intensity have been fabricated successfully. The CCT can be adjusted from 3582 to 5164 K by controlling the current which expands the commercial application prospects of perovskite WLEDs in the future.
4. Experimental
Materials and chemicals
Rubidium chloride (RbCl, 99.9%, Macklin), sodium tellurite (Na2TeO3, 99.9%, Macklin), tin(IV) chloride pentahydrate (SnCl4·5H2O, 99.995%, Macklin), hydrochloric acid (HCl, AR, 37 wt%, Harbin Polytechnic Chem. Reag. Co. Ltd), and isopropyl alcohol (C3H8O, AR, 99.5%, Macklin) are used. All these chemicals are used without further purification.
Synthesis of Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 MCs
Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 MCs are synthesized with the solvothermal method.46x mmol Na2TeO3, 2 mmol RbCl and (1−x) mmol SnCl4 are mixed into 50 ml Teflon bottles and then injected 10 mL HCl into the mixture. The autoclave that contains the Teflon bottles is kept in the drying oven at 180 °C for 12 hours. After that, the obtained solution is cooled to room temperature at a natural speed. The solution is centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min. The precipitate product is washed three times with isopropanol and then dried at 70 °C for 12 hours in a vacuum oven.
Fabrication of LED devices
LED chip (Shenzhen Zhanzhanlong Technology-430 nm) is used to fabricate WLEDs and excite the Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 mixture. Light-transmitting encapsulating silica gel A and light-shielding encapsulating silica gel B are both manufactured by Shenzhen Zhanzhanlong Technology. The mixture contains Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 MCs phosphor and encapsulated silicone A and B. First, Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6 phosphor is mixed with light-transmitting encapsulating silica gel A and light-shielding encapsulating silica gel B. The use ratio of transparent encapsulated silicone A and shading encapsulated silicone B is 1:4. The light-transmitting encapsulating silica gel A and the light-shading encapsulating silica gel B were mixed with Rb2Sn0.95Te0.05Cl6, and then, the mixture was applied to the surface of the 430 nm LED chip. The preparation process is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The air bubbles in the light-transmitting silica gels are then removed using a vacuum chamber, and the mixture is applied to the LED chip. The LED chip is dried at 50 °C for 2 hours at last.
Steady-state PL and TRPL measurements of Rb2Sn1−xTexCl6 MCs
The 405 nm CW laser (FN-405-200 mW, CNI) is used as an excitation light source for steady-state PL excitation. The steady-state PL spectra are collected using a spectrometer (HR4000CG-UV-NIR, Ocean Optics). The TRPL spectra are excited by frequency-adjustable ps laser (MDL-PS-405, CNI) pulses at 405 nm and collected using a spectrometer (SP-2500, Princeton Instruments) with an intensified CCD (ICCD) (PI-Max-1024i, Princeton Instruments). The temperature-dependent PL measurements are performed using a vacuum liquid-nitrogen cryostat (Cryo-77, Oriental Koji) with the capability to give a temperature range from 80 to 480 K.
