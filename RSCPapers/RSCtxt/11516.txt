    , Accepted 7th March 2019First published on 7th March 2019AbstractThe high-value-added chemical reagent peroxydisulfate (S2O82−) was produced photocatalytically over noble-metal loaded WO3 powder suspensions in aqueous H2SO4 under flowing O2 and simulated solar light irradiation. Pt cocatalyst showed the highest photocatalytic activity for S2O82− formation of the studied metals (Au, Pd, Rh, and Ru). Further study indicated that continuous accumulation of S2O82− was achieved only over the Pt/WO3 photocatalyst.
The storage and conversion of solar energy for further use is important for achieving a sustainable future due to the energy crisis and associated environmental problems.1 The conversion of solar energy to chemical energy has been studied intensively since the discovery of the Honda–Fujishima effect in 1972.2,3 In particular, water splitting for H2 formation and CO2 conversion for chemical fuels production have been widely studied over the last 40 years.4–6 Other chemical reagents, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hypochlorous acid (HClO), S2O82−, IO4−, Ce4+, and Cr6+, are alternatives for the conversion of solar energy to chemical energy; however, they have rarely been studied in the last few decades.7,8 The production of these high-value-added chemical reagents via conventional manufacturing processes requires large energy inputs and releases a large amount of CO2.9–12 Therefore, the development of solar-light-driven methods to produce these high-value-added chemicals represents a promising step towards a sustainable and renewable future, because of the solar-energy-based and CO2-free nature of the manufacturing process.
S2O82− (H2S2O8, Na2S2O8, K2S2O8, etc.) is a representative high-value-added chemical reagent. S2O82− is widely used as a strong oxidant in selective organic synthesis, environmental purification, cleaning agents, and other applications.13–15 Generally, S2O82− is produced by the electrolytic oxidation of hydrogen sulfate (HSO4−).11 A high positive redox potential of 2.12 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE; hereafter, all potentials are referenced to RHE) is necessary to trigger this reaction (eqn (1)).7 2HSO4− → S2O82− + 2H+ + 2e− E0 = +2.12 V(1)Therefore, a high current density is necessary to obtain a high efficiency, and large amounts of electrical power are consumed in the manufacturing process.11 Substituting a photoelectrochemical process for this electrochemical process could decrease its energy consumption and increase the current density during irradiation. The first report of the photoelectrochemical formation of S2O82− dates back to 1982, when Graetzel et al. successfully carried out this reaction under visible light irradiation using a WO3 electrode in 3.0 M KHSO4 solution.16 Recently, Lewis et al. and our group also reported this photoelectrochemical process to achieve the production of S2O82−.17–19 However, photoirradiation alone was not enough to drive S2O82− formation in this system; an applied bias or dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was necessary to provide additional driving force. Therefore, S2O82− production directly driven by solar light using a simple system is a challenging but meaningful goal; however, no reports have been published in this area until now.
A powder suspension system with a photocatalyst and a cocatalyst can be treated as a microunit of an electrode system; therefore, a powder suspension system could potentially directly drive the reaction under solar light irradiation.20 WO3 has a very positive valence band (VB) position (ca. +3.0 V),21 which is sufficient for the oxidation of HSO4− in a powder suspension photocatalytic system (eqn (1)). The oxidation of HSO4− to form S2O82− occurs due to the consumption of photogenerated holes; the electrons should also be consumed for the reduction reaction. However, the reduction of water to hydrogen (H2) cannot be performed over the WO3 photocatalyst, as the potential of the reduction of H2O to H2 (E0(H2/H2O) = 0 V) is much more negative than that of the conduction band (CB) of WO3 (ca. +0.5 V).22,23 Thus, an additional reduction half-reaction should be designed to consume the photogenerated electrons. The potentials of the reduction of O2 to H2O2 and H2O (eqn (2) and (3)) are more positive than that of the CB of WO3, thus, it is possible to use these two reactions to consume the photogenerated electrons. Moreover, it has been reported by Abe et al. that these two reactions could occur over Pt loaded WO3.23 O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2 E0 = +0.68 V(2) O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O E0 = +1.23 V(3)
Herein, we designed the first example in which the photocatalytic production of S2O82− was achieved in an aqueous solution with flowing O2 under an AM 1.5G solar light simulator using a noble-metal-loaded photocatalyst. Pt-loaded WO3 showed the highest photocatalytic activity among the noble metals (Au, Pd, Pt, Rh, and Ru) and Pt-loaded photocatalysts (H2WO4, WO3, TiO2, BiVO4, and g-C3N4).
The WO3 before and after Pt loading was characterized using XRD (Fig. S1, ESI†). No differences were observed after 1.0 wt% Pt loaded onto the WO3 (Fig. S1a, ESI†); a pure monoclinic phase (JCPDS 43-1035) was observed both before and after Pt loading.24 No peaks corresponding to the Pt loaded by the photodeposition method were found due to the low Pt loading amount. The XRF spectra confirmed that the loading was approximately 0.9 wt%. The UV-vis DR spectra indicated that WO3 could absorb light wavelengths less than ∼460 nm based on its band gap excitation (Fig. S1b, ESI†). After Pt loading, no obvious change in the spectrum was observed except for a broad absorption over the entire visible-light range. The particle size distribution of the WO3 ranged from less than 100 nm to aggregations of several micrometers (Fig. S1c and d, ESI†). Pt particles with several tens of nanometers in size on the surface of the WO3 was further confirmed by the element mapping results (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Table 1 shows the effect of the cocatalyst on the photocatalytic formation of S2O82− over WO3 (entries 1–6). Without the cocatalyst, only a trace amount of S2O82− was produced after 3 h of irradiation (entry 1). It is clear that only Pt and Pd showed significant photocatalytic activity for the formation of S2O82− in H2SO4 aqueous solution with flowing O2 (entries 2 and 3). Moreover, the amount of S2O82− formed over Pt/WO3 was much higher than over Pd/WO3. 33.9 μmol of S2O82− was formed after 3 h photoirradiation. The quantum efficiency (QE) of S2O82− formation in 3 hours at 420 nm was measured to be 3.8%. The Au, Rh, and Ru cocatalysts on WO3 showed no obvious effects on the formation of S2O82−, i.e., only a trace amount of S2O82− was detected (entries 4–6). H2SO4 is a strong acid (1.0 M, pH = 0) and highly corrosive; some photocatalysts are unstable under such conditions.25,26 Therefore, NaHSO4 (1.0 M, pH = 1) was used to replace H2SO4 as the HSO4− source. The formation of S2O82− over Pt-loaded WO3 was similar when 1.0 M NaHSO4 solution was used (entry 7). The effect of the concentration of these two additives was studied; a similar amount of S2O82− was formed when the same concentration of either additive was used (Fig. S3, ESI†). This result confirmed that the formation of S2O82− was dependent on the concentration of HSO4− ions. Other common photocatalysts were also tested for this reaction (entries 8–11). The production of S2O82− in 1.0 M NaHSO4 over the typical semiconductor photocatalysts17,27–29 such as H2WO4, TiO2, BiVO4, and g-C3N4 under the same conditions is shown in entries 7–11. It was found that the activities of these photocatalysts were very low. Among all the tested catalysts, only WO3 showed significant activity, although the mechanism of the much lower activity of the non-WO3 catalysts is not clear at this time.

The reduction of O2 to form H2O2 was also detected after 3 h of photoirradiation. As shown in Table 1, the amount of H2O2 formed over all the catalysts and cocatalysts was much lower than that of S2O82−. Therefore, either the O2 was mainly reduced to H2O, or the formed H2O2 was easily decomposed under the tested conditions. Blank tests were performed to understand the conditions of formation of S2O82− (Fig. S4, ESI†). Without a photocatalyst, photoirradiation, flow of O2, the Pt cocatalyst, or the additive H2SO4, only a miniscule amount of the product (or no product) was detected, indicating that these conditions were necessary for S2O82− formation. Notably, a flow of O2 was necessary for the photocatalytic production of S2O82−. When the O2 was replaced with N2, only trace S2O82− was detected. This is not surprising, because, as described in the introduction, electrons could not be consumed without a flowing of O2, thus preventing the holes used for the formation of S2O82−.
To understand the differences among the reduction properties of these noble-metal cocatalysts, electrochemical tests of noble-metal loaded conducting glass (FTO) electrodes were performed using a three-electrode system under the same reaction conditions. Fig. 1 shows the dark cathodic current density for O2 reduction over various noble-metal-loaded FTO electrodes in 1.0 M H2SO4 under flowing O2. The most positive current onset potential (Eon) and largest current density were observed for Pt/FTO at 0.81 V (Fig. 1a), indicating that Pt had the highest activity for the reduction of O2 to H2O2 (+0.68 V) and/or H2O (+1.23 V). To be considered that the CB potential of WO3 is ca. +0.5 V, the reduction reaction can proceed if the potential of the reduction reaction is more positive than the CB level of WO3 in the powder suspension system. In other words, the reduction reaction cannot proceed if Eon is not sufficiently positive compared to the CB level of WO3. Pd/FTO showed an Eon of 0.75 V, which is also sufficient for the reduction of O2 to H2O2 and/or H2O (Fig. 1b). The noble metals Au, Rh, and Ru showed Eon values lower than +0.6 V with poor current density, indicating that Pt and Pd showed better reduction properties than those of Au, Rh, and Ru under flowing O2 in 1.0 M H2SO4 solution. Therefore, the Pt and Pd loaded WO3 were able to show higher photocatalytic activity. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) property of Pd in acidic solution was reported to be much poorer than that of Pt.30 The efficiency of use of electron by Pd for ORR was lower than that of Pt. Moreover, the activity of H2 production over Pt loaded CdS photocatalyst was much higher than that of Pd loaded CdS.31 Therefore, it is possible that the recombination rate of electron and hole could be higher in Pd during photoirradiation as compared to that of Pt, leading to the lower photocatalytic activity of Pd/WO3 for S2O82− production.

Both Pt and Pd were able to form H2O2, however, only a trace amount of H2O2 was detected during the reactions. To further understand the reaction process, the photocatalytic decomposition of H2O2 was performed over WO3 loaded with 1.0 wt% of the noble metals (Fig. 2). The reaction conditions were the same as those used for the formation of S2O82−, except that 100 μmol H2O2 was added before photoirradiation. No significant decomposition of H2O2 was observed over bare WO3 during 3 h of photoirradiation under flowing O2 in 1.0 M H2SO4 (Fig. 2e). Interestingly, H2O2 decomposed rapidly over Pt/WO3 (Fig. 2a) and Pd/WO3 (Fig. 2b). The H2O2 was completely decomposed within 1 h over Pt/WO3. However, the other cocatalysts showed no obvious ability to decompose H2O2 (Fig. 2c, d, and f). This further investigation indicated that H2O2 was more easily decomposed over Pt/WO3 and Pd/WO3, which might be the reason that only a small amount of H2O2 was formed during the reaction. This suggested that H2O2 may be formed during photoirradiation but decompose rapidly in the Pt- and Pd-loaded systems; therefore, only very small or trace amounts of H2O2 were detected after 3 h of reaction (Table 1, entries 2 and 3).

The decomposition of S2O82− was also studied over noble-metal loaded WO3 under the same conditions as the decomposition of H2O2, except that the 100 μmol H2O2 was replaced by 100 μmol K2S2O8; results are shown in Fig. 3. Only the Pt-loaded WO3 system showed a continuous increase in S2O82− amount during the 3 h of photoirradiation. The Pd/WO3 and Au/WO3 systems showed obvious S2O82− decomposition, while the Rh/WO3, Ru/WO3, and bare WO3 systems showed no significant decomposition of S2O82−. From this result, the reaction process can be easily understood. Despite its better reduction ability, Pd/WO3 could easily decompose both S2O82− and H2O2, leading to much lower photocatalytic activity for the formation of S2O82−. On the other hand, Pt/WO3 showed a continuous increase in S2O82− formation, and therefore showed the best photocatalytic activity.

Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the time course of 6-cycle of 3 h irradiation of 1.0 wt% Pt/WO3 photocatalyst. The activity of formation showed no obvious loss after the 6th cycle, indicating the well stability of the photocatalyst. The chemical state of W element in Pt/WO3 before and after photoirradiation was studied by XPS (Fig. S6, ESI†). The peaks of 37.5 eV and 35.4 eV were assigned to the W4f5/2 and W4f7/2 in WO3 powder, respectively.32 There was no obvious difference of chemical state changes of W4f before and after reaction, indicating that the chemical state of WO3 was stable. Based on these results, a reaction process was proposed (Scheme 1). Under the simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5G), electron–hole pairs are formed on the WO3 photocatalyst. The oxidation of HSO4− to S2O82− occurs on the Pt-loaded surface of WO3, generating electrons are for the reduction of O2 to H2O and/or H2O2; however, any H2O2 formed is immediately decomposed on the Pt/WO3. For Pd/WO3, the main reaction is that significant S2O82− decomposition occurs in addition to the H2O2 decomposition, leading to lower activity of S2O82−. Thus, a new strategy for the photocatalytic oxidation of HSO4− over Pt/WO3 to produce S2O82−, as well as for H2O2 production, has been developed. This method represents a promising way to directly convert solar energy to high-value-added chemicals using a simple photocatalytic powder suspension system.
