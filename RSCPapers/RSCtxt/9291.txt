    , Accepted 27th February 2017First published on 28th February 2017AbstractCadmium based chalcogenides (CdS, CdSe, CdTe) quantum dots exhibited ultrahigh photoluminescence (PL), quantum yields (QYs) and multicolor luminescence. However, the usual synthesis needs high temperature, inert gas protection, and localized injection operation, which hinder applications seriously. Here, we synthesized CdS QDs and a series of metal-ions-doped QDs using low temperature synthesis (30–80 °C). The synthesis was designed according to supersaturated recrystallization. It was operated under air atmosphere, in DMF solution, free from inert gas protection and used non-injection operation. The obtained QDs exhibit strong and stable luminescence. They have a monodisperse, uniform morphology and good crystallinity. With increasing synthesis temperature, the emission center of the CdS QDs shifts from 500 nm to 550 nm. The metal ions doped in the CdS substrate form a deep level. The emission energy decreases and the emission center shifts to longer wavelengths. The emission peaks located at 520 nm, 534 nm, 540 nm, 578 nm and 625 nm correspond to CdS QDs doped with Sn2+, Sb3+, Ni2+, Mn2+ and Cu2+, respectively. The increased synthesis temperature also results in a red shift of the emission peak. The tunable optical properties and the suitability for large scale production endow the metal-ions-doped CdS QDs with promising potential for lighting and displays, which was demonstrated by white light-emitting diodes with a high CRI value, power efficiency and good stability.
Introduction
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their promising applications in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), displays, solar cells, photocatalysis, and biological imaging.1–5 Luminescent QDs present many advantages compared to organic fluorophores and phosphors such as high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY), tunable emission wavelength, and high stability. Group II–VI semiconductor QDs, especially CdS, CdSe, and CdTe, have been extensively studied because of their emission in the visible range and applications in lighting. Among these semiconductor materials, CdS is an important direct-band semiconductor with a bandgap (Eg) of 2.5 eV. CdS QDs can be used for photoelectric conversion in solar cells, light emitting diodes, displays and bioapplications. Because the unique properties of QDs are based on diameter (quantum size effect), controlling the size and size distribution as well as the crystallinity and surface defects is crucial. Numerous methods have been developed for the production of CdS QDs. Peng and co-workers have successfully developed a high temperature organometallic method to synthesize CdS QDs which has been expanded to synthesize various morphologies of cadmium-based chalcogenide nanomaterials.6–10 In this method, alkylphosphonic acid was used as a ligand. Cd-oleate served as cadmium resource, the hot-injection synthesis method was used. By modulating the reaction temperature, the concentrations of Cd ions and S ions, and the amount of surfactants, various emitting wavelength CdS QDs were obtained. Hyeon and colleagues proposed an alternative method to synthesize rod-shaped CdS nanocrystals based on injection of S-oleylamine into hot Cd-oleylamine precursors.11 Yong et al. researched the synthesis of rod-shaped CdS nanocrystals in oleylamine systematically and obtained CdS nanocrystals of different shapes by adding different surfactants.12 Although great advances have been made in the synthesis of rod-shaped CdS nanocrystals, there are still some drawbacks in the current methods. Firstly, the chemicals used, such as alkylphosphonic acid, long chain alkyl cadmium salt (Cd-oleate, Cd-OAM) and 1-octadecylene, are quite expensive and toxic. Secondly, the current methods based on hot injection, are tedious and dangerous. Last but not least, the reaction must be under a nitrogen atmosphere, which limits the large-scale production of CdS QDs. In parallel with the success of organic synthetic/hot-injected routes, aqueous routes have also been developed to tackle these problems. CdS QDs were synthesized via a hydrothermal route using cadmium chloride, thiourea, and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) as starting materials.13 However, when the technology was applied to large-scale production, the problems of S-ion hydrolysis in the aqueous phase, the degradation of optical properties, the decrease of PL QY and the photostability were unavoidable during synthesis in an aqueous medium. Moreover, the reactions vessel needed a kettle with Teflon lining and longer reaction time, so the aqueous routes were not suitable for large-scale preparation of good-quality CdS QDs and were poor in synthetic reproducibility. So, new synthesis methods that do not require complicated and tedious process must be developed.
Up to now, no reports have discussed in detail low-temperature and inert-gas-protection-free routes to synthesize CdS and doped QDs either via the traditional organometallic method or under microwave irradiation.14–22 In this work, we developed a convenient, non-injection, one-pot method for the synthesis of good optical quality CdS and metal-ions doped QDs by simply mixing Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Na2S·9H2O, oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) in DMF solvent; meanwhile, metal ion chloride salts added to this reaction system can be obtained doped CdS QDs. The synthesis parameters affecting the growth and the optical properties of CdS QDs were thoroughly researched, such as the reaction temperature, precursor concentrations, and the kinds and concentration of doped ions. The highly reproducible large-scale synthesis of CdS QDs with good optical properties could be achieved readily. The obtained CdS QDs possess high crystallinity, and a broad, tunable emitting wavelength from 500 nm to 650 nm with PL QYs of 20–30%. The as-prepared Cu ion doped CdS QDs exhibit a low absorption of light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm; their weak absorption in the green color region prevents the reabsorption that occurs in traditional multiphase phosphors, which causes a significantly low color-rendering index (CRI) and decreases the luminous efficiency of white LEDs. Thus, the QDs-based W-LED fabricated in this work shows outstanding performance as a white-light device, indicating that the as-prepared QDs might be a promising candidate as a light source.
Experimental
Materials
Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99%), oleic acid (OA, 90%), oleylamine (OAM, 95%), methanol (99.9%), cyclohexane (99.5%) and toluene (99.5%) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent (China) Co. Ltd. Na2S·9H2O (99%), Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O (99.5%), CuCl2·2H2O (99%), MnCl2·2H2O (99%), NiCl2·2H2O (99%), SbCl3·2H2O (99%) and SnCl2·2H2O (99%), were purchased from Shanghai RichJoint Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd. Epoxy resin (EP400A, 95%) and anhydride curing agent (EP400B, 95%) were purchased from Nanjing Wuhao Mstar Technology Ltd. All chemicals were used directly without any further purification.
Synthesis of quantum dots by a one-pot method
In a typical synthesis of CdS QDs, Na2S·9H2O (0.4 mmol), Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.4 mmol), DMF solvent (10 mL), OA (0.5 mL) and OAm (0.5 mL) were added to a 50 mL beaker and stirred for 30 min at room temperature, forming a stable and homogeneous transparent precursor solution. Then, the obtained precursor solution was rapidly added into excess absolute alcohol (20 mL) under vigorous stirring. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed three times by alcohol; finally the products were dried in a vacuum drying oven for 30 min at 60 °C. The obtained QDs powder was dispersed in toluene or cyclohexane for further use.
Synthesis of metal-ions-doped quantum dots at low temperature
In a typical synthesis, 10 mL of DMF solution containing metal salts (0.4 mmol of Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 0.04 mmol MnCl2·2H2O or other metal chlorides), 0.4 mmol Na2S·9H2O, OA (0.5 mL) and OAm (0.5 mL) were added to a 50 mL beaker of acid under vigorous agitation for 1 h. The reactions were controlled at different temperatures for doping with specific metal ions (for example: 70 °C for Cu ions and Mn ions; 60 °C for Ni ions; 50 °C for Sn and Sb ions); after the reaction was cooled to room temperature, excess anhydrous alcohol was added, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, and washed three times with alcohol. Finally the products were dried in a vacuum drying oven for 30 min at 60 °C; the QDs powder was dispersed in toluene or cyclohexane for further use.
Fabrication of white LED devices
Yellow CdS QDs and red CdS:Cu QDs [yellow/red phosphors = 2/1 (w/w)] were directly dispersed in cyclohexane and formed a transparent and homogeneous solution; moderate starch was added into the mixture of epoxy resin (EP400A) and anhydride curing agent (EP400B) with vigorous stirring, and the volume ratio of EP400A to EP400B was kept at 2:1. Then, the obtained epoxy resin solution was mixed homogeneously with the QDs cyclohexane solution, the QDs/epoxy resin composite put into a vacuum chamber, and the mixture heated at 60 °C for 40 min; after the mixture formed a jelly, it was directly coated onto 404 nm LED chips and heated in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 30 min.
Characterization
The phase purity of the as-synthesized samples were characterized by a Rigaku DMAX-2000 (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (k = 0.15405 A, 40 kV, 30 mA). with a scanning rate of 4 deg min−1. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry was carried out on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer, over a range from 400 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1. The absorption spectra were measured on a Cary500 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) using BaSO4 as a reference. The UV-vis photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and emission (PL) spectra were determined on a F4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) assembled with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. A JEOL JEM-200CX microscope operating at 160 kV in the bright-field mode was used for Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope operating at 200 kV. A PR-670 spectrum scanner (Photo Research Companies, USA, scan wavelength region 380–780 nm) was used for analysis of the fabricated W-LED spectra. The PL QY values were determined from the following equation:28QY(sample) = (Fsample/Fref)(Aref/Asample)(nsample2/nref2)QY(ref)where F, A, and n are the measured integrated fluorescence emission intensity, the optical density measured at the excitation wavelength and the refractive index of the solvent, respectively. PL spectra were spectrally corrected and quantum yields were determined relative to Rhodamine 6G in ethanol (QY = 95%); all samples were synthesized at 50 °C (CdS, CdS:Sn, CdS:Sb, CdS:Ni, CdS:Mn, CdS:Cu) and showed well-defined first excitonic peaks at 365, 374, 380, 387, 400 and 410 nm, respectively.
Results and discussion
In our work, the synthesis of CdS QDs involved mixing Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Na2S·9H2O, OA and OAM. Considering the better solubility of Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O and Na2S·9H2O in DMF than the current 1-ODE, we chose the relatively inexpensive, universal DMF as reaction solvent; the S ions and Cd ions bound together in DMF solvents due to the intrinsic ionic bond force, meanwhile the OA and OAM coated on the surface of the formed CdS nanoparticles. Here, oleylamine (OAm) and oleic acid (OA) were used as surface ligands, which helped to control the size of the QDs and avoided aggregation of the nanoparticles. In addition, OA and OAM could be also dissolved in DMF to avoid stratification. With the addition of excess alcohol into the completed reaction system, the supersaturated QDs precipitated and the obtained precipitate could be easily dispersed in various non-polar solvents because of the nonpolar group attached to the quantum dots’ surfaces. In this reaction system, all the reactants were mixed in one pot.
The XRD patterns of CdS and doped QDs are shown in Fig. 1a, which display broad diffraction peaks for both types of QDs and agree with JCPDS Standard Card No. 43-1234. The as-synthesized CdS QDs possess a cubic zinc blende crystal structure, which may result from their low growth temperature. Compared to the pattern of pure CdS QDs, a series of diffraction peaks of doped QDs show no obvious shift. The above-mentioned facts demonstrated that the doped ions cause no significant change of the crystal lattice of the CdS substrate nanocrystals. The FT-IR spectrum of CdS QDs powder is displayed in Fig. 1b; the bands at 2920 cm−1 and 1447 cm−1 can be ascribed to the antisymmetric modes of C–C and C–H in OA, respectively, whereas the bands at 3433 cm−1 can be attributed to the bending vibration of N–H in OAm. The specific stretching vibration of the CO in OA can be observed around 1643 cm−1, therefore, the result indicates that OAm and OA are successfully capped on the surface of the CdS quantum dots.

The morphology of both CdS and doped QDs are investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 2). Both types of QDs are prepared under facile and moderate conditions; in detail, all doped QDs were made at a synthesis temperature of 50 °C, except CdS which were at 30 °C. As seen in Fig. 2, all the QDs were nearly spherical and showed a homogeneous dispersion without distinct aggregation. The size distribution of the as-prepared QDs was from 2 to 10 nm. The inset graphs show the HRTEM patterns of the corresponding QDs. The inset picture of Fig. 2a reveals well-resolved lattice fringes of 0.33 nm, which match well with the expected d-spacing of the [111] crystal plane of zinc blende CdS QDs. Thus, the low temperature fabricated nondispersed CdS QDs grow along the [111] crystal direction. Meanwhile, the HRTEM patterns indicate the good crystallinity of QDs prepared at low temperature.

In our experiments, we investigated the influence of doping with various ions on the QDs’ emission wavelength. The doped ions formed a deep energy level located at the forbidden band of CdS. Thus, the metal ions’ dopant emission results from the radiative recombination of electrons located at the bottom of the conduction band of the CdS and holes localized in the deep level. Based on above analysis, the dopant emission energy was less than the intrinsic emission energy (2.5 eV). Compared to the band edge emission of CdS, the dopant emission wavelength was red-shifted. Thus, we could obtain various emission colors by doping with metal ions. The UV-vis absorption and PL spectra of CdS QDs and doped QDs (the molar doping concentration of all ions was 10%) are demonstrated in Fig. 3a; all samples were synthesized at 50 °C. We can observe that PL spectra of Sn-, Sb-, Ni-, Mn-, and Cu-ions-doped QDs located at 500, 520, 534, 540, 578, and 625 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding absorption edges shift to longer wavelengths; these as-synthesized CdS QDs exhibited the intrinsic quantum size effects, thus their size can be regulated by changing the reaction temperature. The size of the QDs increases as the reaction temperature is increased. The typical PL peak of the CdS QDs synthesized at 50 °C was located at 500 nm (2.48 eV), which shifts to longer or shorter wavelength when the size of the QDs was increased or decreased, respectively (Fig. 3b). In addition, with the increase of reaction temperature the absorption peak shows a red shift. CdS:Mn QDs with tunable Mn2+ dopant PL emission peaks ranging from 560 nm to 585 nm could be synthesized at different reaction temperatures varying from 40 °C to 70 °C, with an Mn doping concentration of 10%. For the Cu doped QDs, the optical properties were found to be influenced by reaction temperature. The tunable Cu-dopant PL emissions of CdS:Cu QDs in the red region were realized by changing the band gap CdS host nanocrystals which are synthesized at different temperatured. Based on previous reports,23 we set the Cu ions molar doping concentration as 10%, and investigated the effect of the synthesis temperature on the optical properties. As shown in Fig. 3d, the absorption and emission spectra are both red-shifted as the synthesis temperature is increased; the peak wavelength of PL moves from 610 to 650 nm. These observations show that the CdS:Cu QDs are promising optical nanomaterials in which the emitting wavelength can be conveniently tuned. In addition, we found low absorption at wavelengths longer 500 nm. So, we applied them to W-LEDs.

The as-synthesized CdS QDs show promising potential for solid-state down-conversion materials. Here, taking advantage of their excellent PL properties and good stability, the CdS/CdS:Cu QDs/epoxy resin composite solids with green and red fluorescence are applied to fabricate W-LED devices, in combination with a blue LED chip. As we know, the current YAG:Ce-based white LEDs, due to their lack of color in the red region, show a low color rendering index (CRI). In order to work out this problem, some red light-emitting phosphors have been added to provide an improved red component.23–26 In recent research, CuInS2/ZnS core/shell QDs were reported to show a stronger red emission wavelength around 650 nm; a wider red-emitting region is achieved by changing the experimental conditions, but the absorption band of the CuInS2/ZnS core/shell QDs ranges from 400 nm to 650 nm, indicating an huge absorption in the green and yellow spectral region. Using InP Cu quantum dots will also encounter similar issues. Thus, the CuInS2/ZnS core/shell QDs and InP:Cu QDs are not ideal red light-emitting phosphors for application in W-LEDs.27,28 Here, the low-temperature-prepared CdS:Cu QDs exhibit low absorption of light with a wavelength longer than 500 nm. Thus, the self-absorption problem in W-LEDs is successfully solved; this makes CdS:Cu an ideal red component for use in W-LEDs. Fig. 4a shows the structure of a QDs W-LED, in which a 404 nm electroluminescence chip is covered by the as-prepared yellow emitting CdS QDs, red-emitting CdS:Cu QDs and the epoxy composite. In the LED packaging, we encapsulated the whole LED lamp with QDs/epoxy composites homogeneously, which worked not only as the light conversion material but also as the encapsulant material. In this device, the particles of the QDs are well dispersed in the epoxy and far from the external environment. Thus, the QDs in the epoxy resin might also suffer less heat generated from the chips and corrosion from moisture. In addition, due to the far smaller size of the QDs compared with conventional phosphors, light scattering and refraction in the LED could be greatly improved as well. Therefore, this QDs–epoxy resin structure possesses a strong anti-aging performance and significant life. Fig. 4b shows a photograph of the bright white light emitted from the as-prepared W-LED with a color rendering index (CRI, Ra) of 80 under a 100 mA forward bias current, which is much higher than that of the current YAG:Ce-based commercial white LED (Ra 70). The CIE color coordinates of (0.342, 0.335) and a color temperature (Tc) of 5505 K are also shown in Fig. 4d, corresponding to warm white light. The electroluminescent (EL) spectra of the as-fabricated QDs-LED under different forward bias currents are shown in Fig. 4c, in which the emission peaks of the blue LED chip, CdS and the red-emitting CdS:Cu QDs are located at 404 nm, 520 nm and 625 nm, respectively. The Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of the W-LED under different currents changed little, which demonstrate the ideal optical stability of the QDs-LED. Fig. 4e shows that the power efficiency of the as-fabricated QDs-WLED could reach up to 42 lm W−1 at 100 mA, which is much higher than that of current incandescent light bulbs (PE < 18 lm W−1) and other reports.29–34

The durability of the W-LED is also tested, as shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5a, under the forward bias currents of 100 mA, no obvious changes are observed in the EL spectra, except for the slight red shift from the 404 nm LED chip. The small spectrum of the LED chip doesn't affect the device’s luminescent characteristics. Fig. 5b shows that the CRI and the power efficiency keep stable after 16 h operation. All these results indicate that the composite structure of CdS/CdS:Cu QDs/epoxy resin could be a good solution to achieve a stable, warm W-LED.

Conclusions
In summary, in this work we report a low-temperature, inert-gas-protection-free and non-injection method for the synthesis of CdS and doped QDs with good optical properties. The emission wavelength could be tuned via fine control of reaction temperature and doped ions. Excellent photoluminescence, moderate half peak widths, and high photostability are achieved, compared with those synthesized by current hot-injection methods. As a result, the facile technology is suitable for the large scale production of QDs, and it can be industrialized easily. We also fabricate QDs/epoxy composites by directly dispersing yellow CdS QDs and CdS Cu into an epoxy resin, and the as-prepared W-LED possesses an even better stability against moisture corrosion and heating. Moreover, the QDs-based W-LEDs show bright white light with CIE-1931 coordinates of (0.342, 0.335), an Ra of 80, a Tc of 5505 K and a power efficiency of 42 lm W−1 at 100 mA. When the current intensity is changed and when the device is operated for a long time, the related optical output parameters still remain steady. This indicates that the combination of highly fluorescent CdS/CdS:Cu QDs in W-LEDs can be a promising solution for white light sources with high color rendering properties, efficiency and stability.
