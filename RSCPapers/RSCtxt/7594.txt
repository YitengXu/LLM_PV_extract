The zinc atom of the hat-porphyrins can be coordinated axially with the pyridine moiety of the anchoring porphyrin which is anchored on the titania surface by a carboxyl group. The structures of the assemblies were confirmed using computational calculations, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). Solar cell devices of the monomer anchoring porphyrin and its assemblies were fabricated and the photovoltaic performances were measured under standard AM 1.5 sunlight irradiance. We found that the assembly devices showed higher JSC and lower VOC than that of the monomer anchoring porphyrin device. However, the comprehensive influence of JSC and VOC led to an enhancement in the solar-to-electric power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of the assemblies. We also studied the variation of JSC and VOC using electronic absorption and emission spectroscopy, charge extraction measurements, transient photovoltage decay measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
Introduction
With the forthcoming global energy crisis, it has become a top priority for current society to explore and utilize renewable energy sources such as solar energy. After the seminal discovery by O'Regan and Grätzel,1 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted great interest in recent decades. As efficient photosensitizers based on nanocrystalline TiO2 thin films,2 ruthenium polypyridine complexes,3 metal-free organic dyes4 and zinc porphyrins5,6 have been widely studied due to their prominent photochemical advantages, such as strong light-harvesting abilities, high photovoltaic conversion performance, low cost and facile fabrication as well.7–9
Porphyrins, which show strong absorption at the Soret band (B-band, 400–450 nm) and moderate absorption at the Q-bands (550–600 nm),10–12 have become one of the most intensely studied sensitizers for DSCs because of their intrinsic characteristics and advantages, such as large absorption coefficients in the visible region for the rigid molecular structures, multiple reaction sites available for functionalization (four meso-positions and eight β-positions), etc.11 Thus the optical, physical and electrochemical properties can be finely tuned by varying the peripheral substituents and the central metal ion.13 Furthermore, there are two main guidelines for the structural modification of porphyrins to guarantee thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility for photovoltaic conversion, respectively: (1) the molecular orbital energy levels of the porphyrins should be matched as well as possible to the conducting band (CB) of titania and the oxidation potential of the electrolyte,5,14 and (2) the occupied molecular orbitals (OMOs) and unoccupied molecular orbitals (UMOs) should be separated well and localized on the required region in the porphyrin molecules (the UMOs should be close to the titania film while the OMOs should stay away), especially for the HOMO and LUMO.4,6 Based on the above two guidelines, D–π-A structured porphyrins emerged as required and this kind of porphyrin raised great interest as a promising sensitizer.15–17 So far, the highest η value of DSCs based on a porphyrin dye has already reached 13% under full sunlight by Michael Grätzel and his co-workers,6 and the most efficient porphyrins reported so far, such as SM315 and YD2-o-C8 are all D–π-A structured.5,6
Despite their excellent photovoltaic performance, the single chromophore core structure of D–π-A porphyrins, which restricts the light absorption around the B and Q bands, limits the adjustment of optical absorption, so a co-sensitizer usually needs to be used to compensate for the light harvesting defects between the B and Q bands.5,6 Apart from this, the HOMO and LUMO of classical D–π-A structured porphyrins are not separated completely due to the intrinsic characteristics of having a covalent bond as the linker of the donor moiety and the π-A system of porphyrins. What if we use coordination bonds instead of covalent bonds as the linker? The donor system will be axially vertical to the π-system on porphines which should be conducive to the separation of the HOMO and LUMO. Furthermore, two independent chromophore cores will appear on the assemblies which can be designed and synthesised individually. If appropriate chromophore cores are employed, their light harvesting regions will be complementary for each other as well. In addition, a number of precursory studies have been reported in which a small organic molecular carboxylic acid, such as isonicotinic acid, was used as the anchor to act as the molecular wire for electron conduction from the hat-porphyrins to the conducting band of the TiO2 surface,18–24 demonstrating that our assumption is feasible. However, these small organic molecular carboxylic acids were only used to act as molecular wires for electron conduction while being without any photovoltaic conversion ability by themselves.
Here, we designed and synthesised an anchoring porphyrin ZnPA and a series of hat-porphyrins ZnPH1, ZnPH2 and ZnPH3, collectively labeled as ZnPHx (x = 1, 2 and 3). The anchoring porphyrin, which has photovoltaic conversion ability by itself, can coordinate axially with the zinc atom of the hat-porphyrins by a pyridine moiety, while the carboxyl group on the other end of ZnPA can anchor on the titania surface. These assemblies, as illustrated in Scheme 1, were fabricated into DSC devices and their photovoltaic performance was measured. We have also studied the variation in the photoelectronic properties of the assemblies.

Experimental
General methods
The synthesis of ZnPA, ZnPH1, ZnPH2 and ZnPH3, is presented in the ESI.† Electronic absorption spectra were obtained using a UV-2550 spectrometer. The luminescence spectra were examined using a LS-55 (PE USA Inc.) fluorescence spectrophotometer at room temperature. The morphology and composition of the self-assemblies were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Hitachi Model H-900) and an Ultra Plus microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with semi-quantitative microanalysis using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Varian Mercury Plus-400 (400 MHz) spectrometer. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and current density–voltage (J–V) response spectra were measured under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) and the details are illustrated in our previous work25 and elsewhere.26 Transient photoelectrical examination was carried out using an Autolab-PGSTAT302N electrochemical workstation equipped with an ADC10M high- speed module.27 The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were conducted at a bias voltage of −0.7 V in the dark on a CHI660 electrochemical workstation, with a frequency range of 0.1–100 kHz and an ac amplitude of 10 mV.
Device fabrication
The nanostructured TiO2 film was prepared according to the reported literature.28 The double-layer nanostructured TiO2 electrodes were stained by immersing them into a dye solution (0.30 mM) of ZnPA in CHCl3/EtOH (10/90, v/v) overnight to form the first layer of dye sensitizer. When the unbound ZnPA had been removed by ethanol washing, the dye-coated TiO2 electrodes were immersed into a solution (0.15 mM) of ZnPHx (x = 1, 2 and 3) in CHCl3/DMF (85/15, v/v) for 1 h so as to make the second layer of sensitizer (hat-porphyrin). After washing three times with acetonitrile, the sensitized TiO2 electrode and a thermally platinized FTO electrode were sealed up by heating, with the electrodes separated by a 35 μm thick Bynel hot-melt ring. A liquid electrolyte of LiI (50 mM) and I2 (30 mM) in acetonitrile was used to fill the internal space of the devices. The hole on the counter electrode glass substrate, which had been made with a sandblasting drill to inject the electrolyte, was sealed by heating a Bynel sheet and a thin glass cover.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the assemblies
The assembly forms of the system are shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, the anchoring porphyrin ZnPA was absorbed onto the double-layer nanostructured TiO2 electrodes by bonding to a carboxylic group. Then the hat-porphyrins ZnPHx (x = 1, 2 and 3) were coordinated axially with the anchoring porphyrin by the pyridine group of ZnPA and the zinc atoms of the hat-porphyrins. The assembly structures were characterized using computational calculations, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). According to the results of the quantum chemistry calculations, as shown in Fig. 1, the thicknesses of the monolayer molecular ZnPA and the bilayer self-assembly systems labeled as ZnPA-ZnPH1, ZnPA-ZnPH2 and ZnPA-ZnPH3 are 1.9 nm, 2.5 nm, 2.5 nm and 2.3 nm respectively, which are in agreement with the results of TEM shown in Fig. 2. To further confirm the structure of the self-assemblies, as a model experiment, AgPA was used instead of ZnPA to be the anchoring porphyrin and coordinated with ZnPH3 by the same process as ZnPA-ZnPH3, and was flagged as AgPA-ZnPH3. According to the EDS measurements of AgPA-ZnPH3, the two kinds of porphyrins coexisted on the surface of the nanostructured TiO2 and the molar ratio of the two porphyrins is approximately 2/1, which was revealed by the elemental ratio of Ag to Zn (shown in Fig. S1†). Based on the evidence above, we can make sure that the assembled form of the system is as designed.

Quantum chemical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level (Spartan 08 package) was employed to further investigate the electron density distribution of the frontier orbitals and the other adjacent orbitals. The molecular orbital (MO) patterns of the anchoring porphyrin ZnPA and ZnPA-ZnPHx (x = 1, 2 and 3) assemblies are presented in Fig. S2.† In the case of the assemblies, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) patterns are mainly localized on the core of the hat-porphyrins, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are distributed on the anchoring porphyrin. The obvious allopatry of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) indicates that efficient electron separation will proceed in the assembly systems. The FMO energy levels of the assemblies are plotted in Fig. 3, together with the conducting band (CB) of TiO2 and the oxidation potential of the redox couple I−/I3− as the electrolyte. The energy gaps of the HOMO–LUMO are 2.793 eV for ZnPA, 2.417 eV for ZnPA-ZnPH1, 2.281 eV for ZnPA-ZnPH2 and 2.664 eV for ZnPA-ZnPH3. The energy level of the conducting band (TiO2) and the oxidation potential (I−/I3−) fall in between that of the HOMOs and LUMOs, indicating the thermodynamic feasibility of electron injection from the LUMOs to the CB as well as dye regeneration.

UV-visible and fluorescence spectral properties
The peak wavelengths of the UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of the porphyrins in a THF solution and on nanostructured TiO2 thin films are listed in Tables S1 and S2† respectively. The solution absorption spectra of ZnPA, ZnPH1, ZnPH2 and ZnPH3 in THF are shown in Fig. 4(a). The absorption maxima display typical spectral characteristics of porphyrin, a strong B-band around 430 nm and two weak Q-bands within the range from 530 nm to 630 nm, which is attributed to the π–π* transitions.29 The absorption (B-band and Q-bands) of ZnPA on TiO2 thin films, diagrammed in Fig. 4(b), shows a slight bathochromic shift and is substantially broadened in comparison with the absorption in solution, which are ascribed to the aggregation of porphyrins on the TiO2 surfaces.19,30 Furthermore, the B and Q bands of the self-assemblies display greater broadening than that of monomer ZnPA immobilized on TiO2 thin films which should be ascribed to the double-layer chromophore structure of the assemblies, and the broadening can diminish the photoabsorption lacuna between the B and Q bands of porphyrins on TiO2 thin films and increase the photoelectronic responses.31

The fluorescence spectra are plotted in Fig. 5 and the emission peak wavelengths are listed in Table S2.† The emission maxima of ZnPA fixed on the TiO2 film show hypsochromic shifts compared to ZnPA in solution because of J-aggregations.30 The ZnPA-ZnPHx (x = 1, 2 and 3) assemblies immobilized on TiO2 thin films exhibit large blue shifts in contrast with both ZnPA and ZnPHx (x = 1, 2 and 3) on the titania surface individually, which means significant changes in the structure of the molecules occur after being assembled with each other. The differences in the fluorescence spectra confirmed the self assembled structures from another perspective.

Performance measurements of the solar cells
After the DSC devices were fabricated with the anchoring porphyrin and the assemblies, the corresponding photovoltaic performances were measured under standard AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) response spectra of the devices, which are excited with an optical wavelength from 300 nm to 800 nm, are shown in Fig. 6. The IPCE spectra are basically in agreement with the variation trend of the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (Fig. 3) and the corresponding UV–Vis spectra for the TiO2 thin films (Fig. 4(b)), which means that the smaller the HOMO–LUMO gap a dye has within a certain range, the larger the photovoltaic response of IPCE the device has around the Q-bands. But with the largest HOMO–LUMO gap among the assemblies, ZnPA-ZnPH3 shows unexpectedly a strong response in the Q-band region and even the strongest IPCE response around the B-band. This abnormality can be ascribed to a more powerful driving force of dye regeneration. Being different from the classical DSCs, electrolyte diffusion resistance in our self-assembly system is higher because the existence of hat-porphyrins isolates the electrolyte from the inner sensitizer layer close to the TiO2 thin film to a certain extent. Further details will be discussed in the following sections. In this case, the driving force of dye regeneration plays a more important role in the assemblies than that in traditional DSCs. The HOMO levels of ZnPA-ZnPH1 and ZnPA-ZnPH2, especially for ZnPA-ZnPH2, are too close to the redox potential of I−/I3− which leads to a lack of regeneration driving force, while ZnPA-ZnPH3 performs better in this respect.

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under AM 1.5G illumination and the photovoltaic parameters are presented in Fig. 7 and Table 1 respectively. Compared with ZnPA, the assembly devices displayed a higher short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) but a lower open circuit photovoltage (VOC). The double-layer chromophore structure of the assemblies is the primary reason for the rise of JSC because the hat-porphyrins promote the light absorption and photoelectron production of the assemblies. However, the hat-porphyrins retarded the dye regeneration and then reduced the electron lifetime of the conducting band of titania accordingly, thus its presence could be partially responsible for the reduction of VOC, the details will be discussed later. Due to the above factors, ZnPA-ZnPHx (x = 1, 2 and 3) assembly devices had better photovoltaic performance than ZnPA; and ZnPA-ZnPH3 with both comparatively high JSC (5.52 mA cm−2) and VOC (0.50 V), had the best η(2.06%) and FF (0.74) among the assemblies. In addition, there is no PCE observed for the devices made of a single hat-porphyrin ZnPHx (x = 1, 2 and 3), thus ruling out the possibility of PCE variation caused by hat-porphyrins alone.

Charge extraction and transient photovoltage decay measurements
In order to gain further insight into the interfacial electron transfer in our assembly devices, charge extraction (CE) and transient photovoltage decay (TPD) measurements (shown in Fig. 8) were performed on the devices fabricated with ZnPA and the ZnPA-ZnPHx (x = 1, 2 and 3) assemblies. Generally, there are two factors mainly responsible for the reduction of VOC: (1) a downward shift of the CB energy level of the TiO2 film after being sensitized by dyes and (2) an increased recombination rate of electrons injected into the TiO2 film with the dye and electrolyte in an oxidation state.6 The results of the CE measurements reveal that the CB of TiO2 is downward shifted by 0.2–0.4 V after the monomer dye ZnPA is replaced by the assemblies and that is one cause for the VOC decay. The electron half lifetimes (τTPD1/2) characterised using TPD measurements of the assemblies are shorter than that of the individual anchoring porphyrin ZnPA in the devices which is also responsible for the VOC reduction. In particular, the obviously short electron lifetime of the ZnPA-ZnPH2 assembly is largely due to the excessively close proximity of the HOMO level and redox potential of the electrolyte which has been mentioned previously.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test
To probe deeply into the interfacial dynamics of the charge transfer and recombination in our DSCs, an EIS measurement was conducted on each device at a forward bias of −0.70 V under dark conditions. The Nyquist plots, Bode plots, and the equivalent circuit are illustrated in Fig. 9. There are two semicircles for each device in the Nyquist plots. The larger one in the region of the intermediate frequencies, correspondingly located between 1000–10000 Hz in the Bode phase plots, characterizes the interfacial charge transfer resistance (ZCT in the equivalent circuit) at the interface between TiO2/dye/electrolyte. And the small one at low frequencies (1–50 Hz in the Bode plots and Zele in the equivalent circuit) represents the Nernst diffusion resistance within the electrolyte.32 According to the variation of ZCT, it's obvious to see that the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interfacial electron recombination rates in the assembly devices are faster than that in the monomer anchoring porphyrin ZnPA, which means that the assemblies have shorter electron lifetimes of the CB of TiO2, and the results are in agreement with the measurements of the transient photovoltage decay tests. Furthermore, increased Nernst diffusion resistances (Zele) were observed on the assembly devices compared with ZnPA. The increased Zele might be caused by the presence of hat-porphyrins which isolated the electrolyte from the inner sensitizer layer close to the TiO2 thin film to a certain extent.

Conclusions
We have synthesized an anchoring porphyrin ZnPA and a series of hat-porphyrins ZnPH1, ZnPH2 and ZnPH3, which can axially coordinate with each other by the pyridine moiety and zinc atom in themselves. Then the DSC devices of ZnPA alone and the assemblies named ZnPA-ZnPHx (x = 1, 2 and 3) were fabricated collectively and the photovoltaic performance of each of these solar cells was measured. It turned out that the assemblies showed higher JSC and lower VOC than the device made of the monomer ZnPA. However, the comprehensive influence of JSC and VOC led to enhancements in the solar-to-electric power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of the assemblies, especially for ZnPA-ZnPH3. After further study, we found that the double-layer chromophore structure of the assemblies is the primary reason for the rise of JSC, while the downward shift of the CB on TiO2 and reduction in electron lifetime due to the increased charge recombination rate should be responsible for the reduction of VOC observed in the assembly devices. However, the chromophores in the anchoring porphyrin and hat-porphyrins are both porphines, and their light harvesting regions do not complement each other well. The next step of our study will be focused on finding more appropriate anchoring molecules and hat-molecules to enhance the efficiency of our self-assembled supramolecular solar cells.
