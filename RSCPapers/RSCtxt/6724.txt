    , Accepted 31st August 2018First published on 31st August 2018AbstractColloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are promising building blocks for the realization of future optoelectronic technologies, thanks to their size-tunable electronic and optical properties. Among various types of QDs, colloidal “giant” QDs (g-QDs, core/thick-shell) have been widely used in different applications, such as solar cells, light emitting devices, luminescent solar concentrators and photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen production. However, g-QDs have a thick-shell which serves as a physical barrier for electron and hole transfer, leading to a slow charge transfer rate. In this work, we synthesized CdSe/CdSexS1−x/CdS core/shell/shell g-QDs with an intermediate CdSexS1−x alloyed layer. The presence of this interfacial layer largely improves the absorption of CdSe/CdS QDs, particularly in the 300–650 nm range. By engineering the interfacial layer, the holes can leak more into the CdS shell region compared to that of CdSe/CdS QDs. PEC devices based on alloyed g-QDs exhibit a 20% higher saturated photocurrent density (11 ± 0.5 mA cm−2) compared to CdSe/CdS QDs. In addition, after one-hour illumination (100 mW cm−2), the PEC cell based on alloyed g-QDs still exhibits a photocurrent density of 7.5 mA cm−2, maintaining 70% of its initial value. Such alloyed g-QDs are very promising for several emerging optoelectronic applications, where charge separation, transfer and transport play a critical role for the realization of high performance devices.
1. Introduction
Quantum dots (QDs) are colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals which are widely studied, due to their excellent optoelectronic properties such as size/composition-dependent band gaps, wide absorption spectrum ranging from ultraviolet to near infrared range, high absorption coefficient, narrow photoluminescence (PL) spectrum, high PL quantum yield (QY), and solution processability.1–4 Compared with various types of QDs [e.g. plain QDs and core/thin-shell QDs (with shell thickness less than 1.5 nm)], core/thick-shell QDs, also named as “giant” QDs (g-QDs) have excellent optical and electronic properties.5–8 In the g-QDs system, thanks to their relatively thick shell (typically >2 nm), the core is better isolated from the surrounding environmental conditions, such as solvent, surface ligands and other chemical interactions.5,6,9,10 This isolation endows the g-QDs with excellent optical properties, such as high QY and excellent thermal-/photo-stability compared to plain and thin-shell QDs.1 More importantly, by engineering the shell composition and thickness, the band structure (e.g. type-I, type-II and quasi-type-II) of QDs can be finely controlled.1 For example, in the quasi-type-II CdSe/CdS core/thick-shell QDs, the electrons leak into the shell region, while the holes are still confined in the core region, leading to shell-thickness dependent Stokes shift and absorption spectrum.11 Up to now, many types of g-QDs have been developed, such as CdSe/CdS,5 PbS/CdS,12 PbSe/CdSe,7 CuInSe/CuInS,13 CuInS2/ZnS8etc. and these QDs were used as building blocks for a series of optoelectronic devices such as nanothermometers,14 solar cells,2 luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs),10 and photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices for hydrogen (H2) production.11,12,15 For instance, dual-emission CdSe/CdS dot-in-bulk g-QDs were used for light emitting devices (LEDs) with two emission peaks originating from the CdSe core and the CdS shell, respectively.9 Meanwhile, because of their structure-engineered Stokes shift in CdSe/CdS g-QDs, they have been used as emitters for LSCs, leading to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 1%.10 Generally speaking, as the volume ratio of the shell is over 90%, most g-QDs [with the exception of the near infrared g-QDs (e.g. CuInSe/CuInS)] only absorb in the visible range (less than 500 nm), due to the strong absorption of the materials forming the thick-shell, such as CdS and ZnS.5,8,12 Shell alloying has been used as an efficient way to extend the absorption of g-QDs, while simultaneously modifying the band energy level of QDs.2,15–17 By alloying the CdS shell to form the CdxPb1−xS or CdSexS1−x interfacial layer, both CdSe/CdxPb1−xS/CdS and CdSe/CdSexS1−x/CdS g-QDs exhibit improved absorption in the 500–650 nm range.2,15,17 In addition, the alloyed-shell in CdSe/CdSexS1−x/CdS g-QDs leads to appreciable suppression of Auger recombination because the hole confinement potential at the core/shell interface is reduced.17 Thanks to both the extension of the absorption which significantly overlaps with the Sun's spectrum, and the CdSexS1−x layer acting as an intermediate potential step for efficient hole transfer, solar cells based on CdSe/CdSexS1−x/CdS g-QDs have an enhanced PCE up to 7% compared to bare CdSe QDs (1.22%), core/thin shell QDs (1.58%) and CdSe/CdS g-QDs (3.01%).2 The g-QDs have been used as light absorbers for PEC H2 production, yielding a saturated photocurrent density (J) of ∼10.2 mA cm−2 for CdSe/CdS/CdxPb1−xS/CdS QDs-sensitized TiO2/graphene photoanodes,15 ∼10 mA cm−2 for CdSe/CdS QDs-sensitized TiO2 photoanode,11 ∼5.2 mA cm−2 for PbS/CdS(zinc blend)/CdS(wurtzite) QDs-sensitized TiO2 photoanode,12 and ∼5.3 mA cm−2 for CuInSe/CuInS QDs.18 Core/multiple-shell CdSe/CdS/CdxPb1−xS/CdS QDs offer the highest J for PEC devices based on colloidal g-QDs.15 However, this type of core/multiple shell QDs has several disadvantages. (i) Their synthesis is complicated due to the lattice mismatch (7%) between CdSe and PbS; (ii) the Pb dopant degree in CdxPb1−xS layer is quite low (generally less than 10%) due to the different activity of Pb and Cd precursors during the successive ionic adsorption reaction (SILAR) process; (iii) as the low concentration of Pb in the interfacial layer leads to a relatively weak absorption in the range 500–650 nm, the obtained current density of PEC devices based on g-QDs is still low.
Here, we report the synthesis of CdSe/CdSexS1−x/CdS core/shell/shell g-QDs with an intermediate CdSexS1−x alloyed layer via a SILAR approach. The presence of the interfacial alloyed CdSexS1−x layer largely improves the absorption of CdSe/CdS QDs, particularly in the 500–650 nm range. In addition, by engineering the interfacial layer, the electrons and holes can leak more into the CdS shell region compared to CdSe/CdS QDs, as evidenced by both PL decay measurements and theoretical simulations. PEC devices based on alloyed g-QDs exhibit a 20% higher saturated J (11 ± 0.5 mA cm−2) compared with CdSe/CdS QDs (9.1 ± 0.5 mA cm−2). In addition, after one hour illumination, the PEC cell based on alloyed g-QDs still produces a current density as high as 7.5 mA cm−2, maintaining 70% of its initial value. Our observations indicate that alloyed g-QDs represent a very promising candidate for optoelectronic applications, such as solar cells and PEC H2 production.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of QDs
First, a hot injection approach was used to synthesize CdSe QDs.11 Then CdSe QDs were used as seeds to synthesize core/shell CdSe/CdS and CdSe/CdSexS1−x/CdS QDs via a SILAR method following procedures reported in the literature.11 The detailed reaction process for CdSe QDs and CdSe/CdS QDs and the preparation of S, Se and Cd(OA)2 precursors are included in ESI.† For the synthesis of CdSe/CdSexS1−x/CdS QDs, typically, oleylamine (5 mL) and octadecene (5 mL) were mixed with 0.2 mL of CdSe QDs (∼2 × 10−7 mol in hexane), then the mixture was degassed at 110 °C for 30 min to evaporate the hexane. Subsequently, the temperature was raised to 240 °C under N2 flow. The Cd(OA)2 dispersed in octadecene (0.25 mL, 0.2 M) was added dropwise to the mixture. After 1.5 h, the S/Se trioctyl phosphine solution was added dropwise to the reaction mixture with the same volume. The shell was further annealed for 10 min. After 6-cycle growth of CdSeS alloyed shell, Cd(OA)2/S precursors were used for further growth of the 6-cycle CdS shell. The reaction was cooled to 20 °C by injecting cold toluene (−10 °C) to the reaction mixture. The purified QDs were dispersed in toluene for further characterization and device fabrication.
2.2. Fabrication of QDs-TiO2 anode
The as-prepared colloidal QDs in toluene were deposited into a mesoporous TiO2 film by electrophoretic deposition (EPD).12 Experimental details of the preparation of mesoporous films and deposition of QDs are provided in the ESI.† To fairly compare the performance of PEC devices fabricated using different QDs, all the photoanodes were fabricated under identical conditions, such as EPD deposition time, QDs concentration, thickness of TiO2 film, etc. The as-prepared QDs-TiO2 photoanodes were further coated with two cycles of ZnS layers using the SILAR process.
2.3. Theoretical calculation of wave functions
To simulate the electron/hole wave functions, we solved the stationary Schrödinger equation in spherical geometry following previously published approaches.2 The interaction between electrons and holes was neglected in the calculations.
2.4. Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of QDs and QDs-TiO2 were collected using a JEOL 2100F TEM coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed in a VG Escalab 220i-XL equipped with a hemispherical analyzer recorded for a Twin Anode X-Ray Source. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by using a Panalytical X-Pert PRO MRD with Cu Kα radiation. Absorption spectra were acquired with a UV-2600 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). Fluorescence spectra were acquired with a FLS980 (Edinburgh). QYs of QDs were measured by using Rhodamine 6G as a reference. The PL lifetimes of core/shell QDs were measured using a pulsed laser diode of 440 nm and time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) mode in the FLS980 system. The PL decay curves were fitted using the following equation:11 (1)where, ai (i = 1, 2, 3) are the coefficients of the fitting of PL decay and τi (i = 1, 2, 3) are the lifetimes, respectively.
2.5. PEC measurements
A typical three-electrode configuration consisting of a QD-TiO2 photoanode, a platinum (Pt) counter electrode, and a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode was used to investigate the PEC performance. The electrolyte containing 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 (pH ∼13) was used as sacrificial hole scavenger.11,12,19 All measured potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the equation: VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.197 + pH × (0.059).11,12,19 Simulated Sunlight intensity was monitored by a thermopile and adjusted to ∼100 mW cm−2 using the LSC-100 Simulator. The average working area of the QDs-TiO2 photoanode was ∼0.1–0.16 cm2. All PEC devices were measured at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and structure of g-QDs
CdSe/CdS g-QDs have been widely investigated as a standard core/thick-shell system due to their well-controlled core size and shell thickness via a wet-chemical approach.5,6,9–11,20–23 Here, we used CdSe/CdS as model system to study the alloyed shell effect on the optoelectronic properties of alloyed g-QDs. CdSe/CdS and CdSe/CdSexS1−x/CdS g-QDs were synthesized via a SILAR approach.17 The details are included in the Experimental section and ESI.† All g-QDs were synthesized using the same CdSe QDs as seed with core radius (R) of 1.65 nm. Four samples with different shell thicknesses (H) were synthesized, including 6-monolayer CdSe/CdS QDs [denoted as CdSe/6CdS (H of 2 nm)], 12-monolayer CdSe/CdS QDs [denoted as CdSe/12CdS QDs (H of 4 nm)], 6-monolayer CdSe/CdSexS1−x QDs [denoted as CdSe/6CdSexS1−xQDs (H of 2 nm)], and 6-monolayer CdSexS1−x and 6-monolayer CdSCdSe/CdSexS1−x/CdS QDs [denoted as CdSe/6CdSexS1−x/6CdS QDs (H of 2 nm for CdSexS1−x and H of 1.7 nm for CdS)] (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 1a–c, the CdSe and core/shell QDs exhibit a spherical shape, similar to previous reports.5,6,10,22,23 All samples have a uniform size distribution (standard deviation, σ < 10%). The large size in core/shell QDs with respect to bare CdSe QDs confirms the successful synthesis of g-QDs through the SILAR approach. High resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of core/shell g-QDs indicate a highly crystalline structure in both the CdSe/6CdSexS1−x/6CdS (Fig. 1b and d) and CdSe/12CdS QDs (Fig. 1c and e). Because of the similar lattice constant of CdS and CdSe, a clear boundary between the CdSe core, the CdSexS1−x interfacial layer and the CdS shell cannot be detected in the HRTEM images (Fig. 1b–e). The SAED patterns and XRD patterns of CdSe/12CdS QDs and CdSe/6CdSeS/6CdS g-QDs prove that the as-prepared QDs have a wurtzite (WZ) crystal structure (Fig. S1 and 2†), consistent with the reported results for both CdSe/CdS and CdSe/CdSexS1−x QDs in the literatures.2,5,6,10 The XRD pattern of CdSe/6CdSeS/6CdSQDs exhibits reflection at an intermediate position between the pure CdSe QDs and the CdSe/12CdS QDs, intermediate between WZ CdS and WZ CdSe phases, indicating the presence of alloyed layer between the CdSe core and CdS shell (Fig. S2†). Taking advantage of the fine control of the chemical composition of shell materials via the SILAR approach, the molar ratio of Cd/S/Se is around 4:3:2, as confirmed by XPS (Fig. S3†), indicating that the x value of the interfacial CdSexS1−x is close to 0.5, consistent with the feeding ratio of Se/S (1:1) precursors.2 By using the EPD approach, the QDs can be deposited inside the mesoporous TiO2 film (14 μm thick). As shown in Fig. 1f, the g-QDs were dispersed at the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles.

3.2. Optical properties in core/alloyed shell QDs
CdSe/CdS g-QDs typically absorb radiation from 300 to 500 nm, with very weak absorption in the range 500–650 nm due to the low absorption of the CdSe core (Fig. 2a). A first-exciton absorption peak of the CdSe/CdS g-QDs is around 609 nm, due to the strong leakage of electrons into the CdS shell (Fig. S4†). This drawback limits their application in high-efficiency solar technologies.24–28 Ideal QDs would have wide absorption, so as to match the solar spectrum.24–27,29 Alloying the CdS shell with a CdSexS1−x layer extends the absorption to the red spectral range, up to 650 nm (Fig. 2a) exploiting the narrower bandgap of CdSe (Eg = 1.79 eV) compared to CdS (Eg = 2.49 eV).2 Compared to the high QY of CdSe/6CdS QDs (∼70%), CdSe/6CdSexS1−x QDs have a much lower QY of 10%, similar to that of initial CdSe QDs without shell coating (Fig. 1a). This low QY of CdSe/6CdSexS1−x QDs indicates more surface traps compared with CdS-shelled QDs.2 Consistently, the emission of the CdSe/6CdSexS1−x QDs has a short lifetime due to its high non-radiative decay rate (Fig. 3b and Fig. S5†). By coating the CdSe/6CdSexS1−x QDs with six additional monolayers of CdS, their QY increases from 10% to 40%, due to the improvement of surface passivation (Fig. 3a). However, the lifetime of CdSe/6CdSexS1−x/6CdS QDs (∼22 ns) is similar to that of the CdSe/6CdSexS1−x QDs (21 ns) and is shorter than that of CdSe/12CdS QDs (∼45 ns) (Fig. 2c, Fig. S5† and Fig. 3b).

To better understand the exciton dynamics in alloyed shell QDs, we calculated the e/h wave functions of a CdSe/CdS and CdSe/CdSeS/CdS QD based on its bulk band alignment using the effective mass of e/h in bulk CdSe and CdS.2 As shown in Fig. 4a, the electrons in CdS-shelled CdSe/CdS QDs (R/H: 1.65/4) have a high probability of penetrating into the CdS layer (9.7%), while the holes are still mainly confined in the core region (1% leakage), forming a typical quasi-type II band structure.30 In the CdSe/CdS QDs with an alloyed CdSeS interfacial layer (R/HCdSeS/HCdS: 1.65/2/2), both electron and hole leak into the interfacial layer deeply (19% leakage for electron and 4% for holes). These results indicate a larger overlap of the e/h in the shell region of alloyed-shell QDs as compared to CdSe/CdS QDs, which explains their shorter lifetime and the slight broadening of the PL peak compared to CdS-shelled QDs (Fig. 2b). The calculated bandgaps are 2.18 eV (569 nm) in CdSe/CdS QDs and 2.08 eV (595 nm) in alloyed-shell QDs, which is consistent with the trend of the absorption spectrum of CdSe/CdS QDs and alloyed-shell QDs (Fig. 2a). More importantly, the larger e/h degree of leaking in alloyed-shelled compared to CdSe/CdS QDs may be helpful for e/h transfer from QDs to e/h acceptors and for further improving the efficiency of optoelectronic devices. In summary, in the core/alloyed-shell/shell CdSe/CdSeS/CdS QDs, the presence of the interfacial layer contributes both to the wider absorption of QDs and to an increased leakage of e/h to the shell region compared to CdSe/CdS QDs with similar shell thickness. In addition, as most of the electrons and holes are still confined inside the QDs (core and shell region) and do not leak into the surface of the QDs, the alloyed QDs still confer excellent optical properties to the QDs, as confirmed by their high QY and relatively long lifetime.

3.3. PEC performance of QDs based photoanode
Many types of semiconductors have been used for solar technologies.31–36 Among them, CdSe/CdS g-QDs have been used as light absorbers for PEC H2 production.11,12,15,18 However, due to the thick-CdS-shell serving as physical barriers for the hole transfer from the core to the electrolyte (typically Na2S/Na2SO3), the hole accumulation often leads to the fast photocurrent decay of the PEC devices.11 As we will show, engineered interfacial CdSexS1−x improve the hole transfer rate, thus reducing the fast e/h recombination. Fig. 5a shows the schematic energy diagram of PEC devices based on QDs. In this study, PEC measurements were carried on using three-electrode system (details in the Experimental section). As shown in Fig. 5b and c, the alloyed CdSe/6CdSeS/6CdS QDs-sensitized TiO2 photoanode exhibited a saturated J of 11 mA cm−2 under one simulated sunlight at 100 mW cm−2, which is 20% higher than that of PEC devices based on CdSe/12CdS QDs. The highest J obtained in this work is higher than all other types of PEC devices based on g-QDs, such as ∼10 mA cm−2 for CdSe/CdS QDs-sensitized TiO2 photoanode,11 ∼10.2 mA cm−2 for CdSe/PbxCd1−xS/CdS QDs-sensitized TiO2/graphene photoanode,15 ∼5.3 mA cm−2 for PbS/CdS QDs-sensitized TiO2 photoanode12 and ∼3.1 mA cm−2 for CuInSe/CuInS g-QDs-sensitized TiO2 photoanode.18 This value is also more than two times higher than the J of other PEC cells based on carbon dots (5 mA cm−2), and BiVO4/WO3 (5.3 mA cm−2).27,28 This value is lower than the PEC cells based on CdS and CdSe QDs-co-sensitised TiO2 (14.9 mA cm−2)37 and PbS and Mn-CdS QDs-co-sensitised TiO2 (22.1 mA cm−2),38 yet in both cases the QDs were deposited in situ on TiO2 thin films using time-consuming and uncontrollable chemical bath deposition and the J drops quickly due to the unstable photoanode. Under the same measurement conditions, the photoanodes based on CdSe/6CdS QDs and CdSe/6CdxS1−x exhibited a saturated J as high as 6 mA cm−2 and 7 mA cm−2, respectively. The lower value of J in 6-monolayer CdSe/CdS QDs can be attributed to their electron confinement in the core region, leading to a slow electron transfer rate and fast e/h recombination. On the other hand, the low J in CdSe/6CdxS1−x QDs based photoanode compared with that based on CdSe/6CdxS1−x/6CdS QDs is mainly due to the presence of recombination centers at the surface of QDs, as confirmed by their low QY (10%). A similar saturated J was found in the photoanode based on bare CdSe QDs (5 mA cm−2).

To understand in depth the higher current density in CdSe/6CdSeS/6CdS g-QDs, we further measured the J–V curves of the PEC cells using the band-edge pass filter as shown in Fig. 6a. There is no significant difference between the two types of g-QDs for the wavelengths 405 ± 20 nm and 450 ± 20 nm (Fig. 6b). At 500 ± 20 nm the photoresponse of the sample CdSe/12CdS drops, compared to the CdSe/6CdSeS/6CdS QD based photoanode, and does not present any photoresponse at 600 ± 20 nm, due to the very weak absorption for these QDs. The anode based on alloyed g-QDs, instead, exhibits J of 0.8 mA cm−2, which clearly indicates that the wider absorption range of alloyed g-QDs contributes to its higher J. In addition, the presence of the interfacial CdSeS layer may also improve the hole transfer, which further boosts the J in the alloyed g-QDs based anode.15

Recent efforts focused on engineering the interfacial structure of QDs to improve the stability of PEC devices.11,12,15,19 For example, Adhikari et al. used the alloyed PbxCd1−xS layer to improve the PEC stability of CdSe/CdS QDs.15 As shown in Fig. 7, the alloyed g-QDs based anodes have better stability compared with the anode based on CdSe/CdS QDs. The presence of the alloyed layer likely improves the hole transfer rate due to the large penetration of the hole's wavefunction into the shell region (Fig. 4). As a result, there is less hole accumulation in the alloyed QDs compared to pure shell QDs. After one hour illumination (100 mW cm−2), the retained J in alloyed shell QDs based anode is still around 7.8 mA cm−2. The evolution of H2 generation was calculated based on previous studies.11 A H2 generation rate of 82 mL cm−2 per day was found in the alloyed g-QDs, 30% higher than that of PEC device based on CdSe/12CdS QDs. This hydrogen generation rate is comparable to the values reported (20–115 mL cm−2 per day) in the literature.1,11,12,15,19,39–43

4. Conclusions and perspectives
We synthesized CdSe/CdSexS1−x/CdS core/shell/shell g-QDs with an intermediate CdSexS1−x alloyed layer via a SILAR approach. The presence of an interfacial alloyed CdSexS1−x layer largely improves the absorption of CdSe/CdS QDs with stronger absorption in the range of 500–650 nm. A typical quasi type-II band alignment was found in the alloyed g-QDs with more e/h leakage into the shell region compared to CdSe/CdS QDs with similar shell thickness, as confirmed by both theoretical simulations and PL decay measurements. These QDs are most promising for applications in QD-based optoelectronic devices. PEC devices based on alloyed g-QDs exhibit a 20% higher saturated J (11 ± 0.5 mA cm−2) compared with CdSe/CdS QDs. The H2 generation rate of PEC devices based on alloyed g-QDs is ∼82 cm−2 per day, which is comparable to the best-reported QD-based anodes. This alloying approach may be used for other types of g-QDs (e.g. PbS/PbCdS/CdS, PbSe/CdPbSe/CdS, SnSe/SnSeS/SnS, CuInSe/CuInSeS/CuInS g-QDs) for optoelectronic applications, such as solar cells and LEDs.
