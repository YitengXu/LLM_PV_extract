The general design of self-doping materials based on a phenolamine structure with strong electronic spin concentration is reported for the first time. A phenol-enhanced self-doped mechanism is also proposed. Compared to their precursors, dimethylphenolamine derivatives, TBP-OH4, TPD-OH4 and Spiro-OH8, displayed much higher spin concentration in their neutral states. Phenol acts as a hole trap in the traditional concept, however, the films of TBP-OH4, TPD-OH4 and Spiro-OH8 exhibited higher conductivities than those of methoxyl precursors. Meanwhile, phenolamine derivatives have good solublility in polar organic solvents and show good solvent resistance in chlorobenzene. Considering the relatively good band alignment, film-formation and solvent resistance against chlorobenzene, Spiro-OH8 and TPD-OH4 exhibited comparable performance with that of PEDOT:PSS-4083. Most importantly, a new generation of self-doped systems based on a phenolamine structure might provide new insight in developing efficient HTMs for organic electronics.
Solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer structure have gained particular attention because of their potential for low-cost fabrication and high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1,2 p-Doped and water soluble poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is the most widely used hole extraction material (HEM) in PSCs due to its high conductivity, anti-erosion and solution processability.2g,i However, the indispensable chemical dopant of PSS gives rise to a series of negative effects on device fabrication and durability.2a The manufacturing of HEMs with high hole-mobility and without additional chemical dopants is becoming one of the most critical issues for achieving long-term device durability and practical application.
Herein, a series of polar solvent soluble phenolamine derivatives, TPA-OH2, TBP-OH4, TPD-OH4 and Spiro-OH8, were obtained by substitution of the –OMe groups on triphenylamine derivatives with –OH groups. The detailed synthetic scheme and characterization of the products are provided in the ESI (Scheme S1 and Fig. S2–S8†).3 Interestingly, a neutral radical system was found in the triphenylamine derivatives, namely due to the self-doped behavior, which was completely different to the traditional radical cation of triarylamines observed by Wang (Fig. 1).4b,e The radical species and physical properties of the triphenylamine derivatives were thoroughly studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy, variable temperature 1H NMR (VT NMR), electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and by a hole-only electronic device. It is worth noting that the phenolamine derivatives show a much higher spin concentration than those of the methoxyl precursors. Compared to the methoxyl precursors, the strong self-doped behavior of the phenolamine derivatives resulted in higher conductivity. Finally, because of relatively good anti-erosion and film-formation properties, Spiro-OH8 and TPD-OH4 were applied as HEMs in PSCs and their hole extraction properties were also studied.

Typical peaks from UV-vis absorption appeared at 294 nm, 310 nm, 350 nm and 380 nm for TPA-OH2, TBP-OH4, TPD-OH4 and Spiro-OH8, respectively (Table 1). Before and after demethylation, the compounds showed relatively similar UV-vis absorption bands and photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. S10†). Notably, the color of the products obviously deepened in the powder form after demethylation, which was in good agreement with the results from the enlarged UV-vis spectra in the low-energy absorbance region of the four products (Fig. S11†). Considering the molecular structure of the four phenolamine derivatives, their low-energy absorbance might come from the radical state.4

ESR spectra are shown in Fig. 2 to investigate the radical state of the products. The g values of TPA-OH2, TBP-OH4, TPD-OH4 and Spiro-OH8 were 2.040, 2.0031, 2.0036 and 2.0033, respectively, which are very similar to each other. Meanwhile, the spin concentration of the four products significantly increased after demethylation. In particular, the spin concentration of TBP-OH4 increased 104-fold compared to that of TBP-OMe. Meanwhile, the spin concentration of TPA-OH2, TPD-OH4 and Spiro-OH8 was also estimated to be 8-, 24- and 3352-fold, respectively, with the corresponding methoxyl precursors as references. It is interesting that TBP-OH4 showed a relatively higher spin concentration and no clear hyperfine spectrum could be detected in its 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S5†). It is likely that the reason stems from the excited triplet state at room temperature.4a,b,d

Firstly, in order to reveal the origin of the radical signal of these neutral compounds, the VT NMR spectra of TBP-OH4 and its radical cation species were investigated. TBP-OH4 showed an obvious delocalized radical with a relatively broadened 1H NMR signal at room temperature and further broadening at elevated temperatures (Fig. 3b). This indicated that more thermally excited triplet diradical species were generated with increasing temperature. However, it has been demonstrated that the diradical cation of TBP-OH4, which was obtained by adding excess [NO]+[PF6]−, showed no 1H NMR signal from aromatic protons in a CD3OCD3 solution with a total triplet state at room temperature (Fig. S12†). This revealed that the radical species of TBP-OH4 was not from its diradical cation.

Moreover, the 1H NMR peaks of TBP-OH4 became obviously sharper when the temperature decreased to −80 °C, particularly for the protons b and c + d (Fig. 3). Meanwhile, the decrease in temperature led to a downfield shift of the phenolic proton, which can be explained by an enhanced intermolecular interaction. This phenomenon of VT NMR would not occur in a molecule with a monoradical cation, owing to the S = 1/2 state. This indicated that the radical species of TBP-OH4 was also not from its monoradical cation.
Secondly, TPA-OH2, TBP-OH4, TPD-OH4 and Spiro-OH8 can be readily purified with a mixed solution of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate on silica gel. This indicated that the whole molecules of TPA-OH2, TBP-OH4, TPD-OH4 and Spiro-OH8 were in the neutral state instead of forming radical cations, due to their low polarity (Fig. S14†). Furthermore, the XPS and elemental analyses of Spiro-OH8 also confirmed the neutral state, because there was no Br− anion, which might have come from the by-product of the raw material of BBr3 in its powder form (Table S1 and Fig. S13†).
Finally, the products with a deep color could also be eluted using thin layer chromatography (TLC), especially for TBP-OH4, owing to its obviously visible deep green color (Fig. S14†). It was demonstrated that the low-energy absorbance comes from the corresponding radical state. This result further confirmed that the radical species of TPA-OH2, TBP-OH4, TPD-OH4 and Spiro-OH8 were not from their radical cations.
All of the three experiments above provided solid evidence for the neutral state of the radical species of the four products. Meanwhile, the methoxyl precursors also showed a lower spin concentration compared with those of the phenolamine derivatives (Fig. 2 and S15†). Furthermore, we also investigated another low band-gap triphenylamine derivative, TPA-OMe-DPP, based on a 2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) block. The synthesis, 1H NMR and mass spectrum are provided in the ESI (Scheme S2, Fig. S1, S9 and S15†). TPA-OMe-DPP also showed an ESR signal in the solid form and 1H NMR signal broadening for the aromatic protons in CDCl3 (Fig. S15a†).
These results revealed that the mechanism of the radical species above not only existed in phenolamine derivatives but also in methoxyl derivatives. Considering the general radical signal and neutral state of the triphenylamine derivatives, we conjectured that a radical state existed in pristine triphenylamine derivatives instead of a radical cation (Fig. 3a).4 The proposed mechanism is described as follows. Two electrons are excited from the symmetrical phenolamine groups into the LUMO of TBP-OH4, respectively, thus leaving two holes in the HOMO of TBP-OH4.5 The symmetrical phenolamine groups still contain one lone electron, respectively, and therefore the holes in TBP-OH4 are backfilled by the electron transferred from the symmetrical phenolamine groups. A pair of free electrons remain in the LUMO of TBP-OH4, and are stabilized by the quinonoid resonance structure and intermolecular interaction. As a result, the TBP-OH4 molecule partially exists as an excited triplet state at room temperature with an S = 1 state.5 Thus, the whole molecule of TBP-OH4 is in the neutral state. The low-energy absorbance of TBP-OH4 was from the resonance structure of the connecting two nitrogen radical centers. The other triphenylamine derivatives have a similar mechanism as TBP-OH4.
It is worth noting that the phenolamine derivatives show a much higher spin concentration than those of their corresponding methoxyl precursors. When the –OMe substituent was replaced by an –OH group, the oxidation potential of the triphenylamine derivatives showed a slight decrease (Fig. S16†). In addition, compared to the corresponding methoxyl derivatives, the band gap of the phenolamine derivatives was obviously narrower in the solid state, resulting in the low-energy absorbance, which was related to the hydrogen bonding in the phenolamine derivatives in the solid state. Thus, with the increased HOMO level and decreased energy band gap, an electron might be excited from the ground state more easily. We conclude that the –OH group is beneficial for the generation and stabilization of radical species.
As described in the discussion above, the easily excited electron from the ground state and intermolecular interaction play very important roles in the self-doped system.
In order to further study the radical state of TPA-OH2, TBP-OH4, TPD-OH4 and Spiro-OH8 in their neutral states, the oxidized and charged states of these materials were probed by chemical oxidation (Fig. S18†). Therefore, considering the CV measurements of the phenolamine derivatives (Fig. S16†), nitrosonium hexafluorophosphate [NO]+[PF6]− with a formal potential of 1.4 V should be an effective oxidant to obtain their radical cations.4dTPA-OH2 could be easily oxidized into a monocation with two relatively sharp absorptions with λmax at 500 and 747 nm. TBP-OH4 was oxidized to a monoradical cation using a moderate amount of [NO]+[PF6]−, with three absorption bands over the visible and NIR regions (λmax: 418, 589 and 1014 nm). After adding excess [NO]+[PF6]−, the radical cation was further oxidized into a diradical cation (λmax: 515 nm). The –OH group in TBP-OH4 could not be oxidized with excess [NO]+[PF6]−, which was confirmed by 1H NMR (Fig. S12†). Similarly, TPD-OH4 could be easily oxidized into a monoradical cation (λmax: 493, 719 and 1295 nm), and then a diradical cation (λmax: 498 nm) with excess [NO]+[PF6]−. According to the CV data, Spiro-OH8 undergoes two-electron oxidation to a diradical dication with a trace amount of [NO]+[PF6]− (a broad absorption between 435 nm and 838 nm; λmax: 1338 nm), and then two-electron oxidation to a tetracation with excess [NO]+[PF6]− (λmax: 522 nm).
The electrochemical stability of the phenolamine derivatives was also investigated (Fig. 4). The CV curves of TPD-OH4 and Spiro-OH8 were measured both in solution and in the film state. Owing to poor film-formation, the CV results of TPA-OH2 and TBP-OH4 were only measured in solution. All of the derivatives had reversible peaks under the oxidative process and showed a negligible change after 20 repetitive cycles, which was comparable with their corresponding methoxyl precursors (Fig. S17†). This indicated that the phenolamine derivatives showed good electrochemical stability.

The self-doped behavior could greatly enhance the charge transport properties of the material.6 Therefore, the conductivities of the TBP-OMe, TPD-OMe, Spiro-OMeTAD, TBP-OH4, TPD-OH4 and Spiro-OH8 films with no treatment were measured (Table 2). Due to poor film formation, the conductivities of TPA-OMe and TPA-OH2 were not measured. The conductivity of the TBP-OH4, TPD-OH4 and Spiro-OH8 films was 1.3 × 10−5 S cm−2, 1.0 × 10−5 S cm−2 and 3.0 × 10−6 S cm−2, respectively. The conductivity of the Spiro-OMeTAD film was 6.7 × 10−7 S cm−2. However, the sheet resistance of the TBP-OMe and TPD-OMe films was too large and could not be measured in our test. The obvious increase in conductivity was also one piece of solid evidence to prove the self-doped mechanism in phenolamine materials. Moreover, the conductivity of Spiro-OH8 also had an obvious increase with increasing annealing temperature in the hole-only device, which indicated that the radical state of Spiro-OH8 could be stimulated by temperature (Fig. 5b).

As expected, after demethylation, the four products were highly soluble in DMSO, DMF (>300 mg mL−1), methanol, acetone, and ethyl acetate but insoluble in chloroform, toluene and chlorobenzene, which was contrary to the methoxyl-based materials and provided good orthogonal solvent processability for chemical processing of multilayer devices from solutions (Fig. S22a†). Meanwhile, considering the good anti-erosion, film formation and band alignment, Spiro-OH8 was applied in the PSC devices.
The water contact angle, thermal properties and energy level of Spiro-OH8 were studied before device fabrication (Fig. S19, S20 and S22†). The surface of Spiro-OH8 (68.7°) is more hydrophobic than that of PEDOT:PSS (57.3°). In addition, the water contact angle of two other materials, TBP-OH4 (71.4°) and TPD-OH4 (68.3°), also showed higher hydrophobicity than that of PEDOT:PSS. This indicates that the films of the phenolamine derivatives would help to improve the coverage of the active layer as it is typically hydrophobic in nature.7 Meanwhile, the phenolamine derivatives might demonstrate a high performance in expelling moisture away from the devices. Spiro-OH8 exhibited a thermal decomposition temperature (Td) of 371 °C and glass transition temperature (Tg) of 98 °C. The HOMO of Spiro-OH8 was calculated to be −5.08 eV from CV measurements, which is almost the same as that of PEDOT:PSS (Table 1).2
As we know, an appropriate doping amount is beneficial for the performance of Spiro-OMeTAD in perovskite solar cells.8 Due to the light-induced doping effect in the doped Spiro-OMeTAD film, the doping level is not controllable and easily leads to a decline in the performance of a solar cell device.8b However, the UV-irradiation ESR experiment showed that the Spiro-OH8 powder was very stable under strong UV-irradiation of 100 W (Fig. S21†).
The performance of Spiro-OH8 was evaluated by fabricating BHJ polymer solar cells (Table 3, Fig. 5 and S25†) with a device structure including indium tin oxide (ITO)/HEM/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/PFN-Br/Al (Fig. 5a and S24†). The detailed PSC preparation is described in the ESI.† The best Spiro-OH8-based device exhibited a PCE of 8.20%, with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.740 V, a short current density (Jsc) of 16.51 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 67.1% by spin-coating Spiro-OH8 at 5 mg mL−1. Meanwhile, in order to further understand the performance of the phenolamine derivative in PSCs as a HEM, TPD-OH4 was also employed in a device. The device with TPD-OH4 as a HEM also showed a good performance, yielding the highest PCE of 8.16% (Voc = 0.700 V, Jsc = 16.97 mA cm−2, and FF = 68.5%). The PCE of the Spiro-OH8-based device is better than that of the TPD-OH4-based device, which is mainly related to the improved Voc. It is in good agreement with the slight difference of the HOMO level between Spiro-OH8 and TPD-OH4 (Table 1). Moreover, the performance of Spiro-OH8 and TPD-OH4 is much higher than that of bare ITO-based devices. The PEDOT:PSS control device showed a relatively better performance, yielding the highest average PCE of 8.40% (Voc = 0.780 V, Jsc = 15.52 mA cm−2, and FF = 69.5%).2d The PEDOT:PSS based devices showed a slightly higher Voc than Spiro-OH8 and TPD-OH4 due to the relatively appropriate HOMO level between that of ITO and PTB7-Th. Considering the relatively poor film properties, in terms of electrical conductivity, Spiro-OH8 showed a lower FF than PEDOT:PSS (Fig. S23†).9 Interestingly, comparing the Jsc of Spiro-OH8 with that of PEDOT:PSS, Spiro-OH8 showed an obvious advantage.

Meanwhile, the dependence of the device performance on the HEM thickness was investigated by spin-coating different concentrations of Spiro-OH8 solutions, from 5–16 mg mL−1. The roughness decreased with the increasing spin-coating concentration of Spiro-OH8 (Fig. S23†), however, the performance of the devices declined gradually with increasing HEM thickness. The degradation of the PCEs is mainly due to the decline of Voc and FF, whereas Jsc did not change. To understand the high performance of Spiro-OH8, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was also investigated (Fig. 5d and S25b†). Spiro-OH8 showed higher EQE between 370–450 nm, despite this, the EQE of Spiro-OH8 in the 300–370 nm range was lower than that of PEDOT:PSS. In contrast, with the increasing thickness of Spiro-OH8, the EQE decreased in the UV absorption range of Spiro-OH8, which was in good agreement with the J–V results and showed similar trends (Fig. S25b†). On the whole, Spiro-OH8 and TPD-OH4 exhibited comparable performance with that of PEDOT:PSS-4083.
Finally, the shelf-life stability of the PSC devices with self-doped materials as HTMs was also studied. The devices based on Spiro-OH8 and TPD-OH4 presented enhanced stability compared to that based on PEDOT:PSS-4083 after 216 h of storage. The PCEs based on Spiro-OH8 and TPD-OH4 dropped by 16.5% (Fig. S26†) and 17.3% after 216 h, respectively, compared with 24.2% for PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 6). The decrease in the PSCs performance was attributed to the parameters FF and Jsc.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel phenolamine-based neutral radical system with high spin concentration was found for the first time and its self-doped mechanism was proposed. The phenolamine structure is beneficial for the generation and stabilization of radical species, owing to strong intermolecular interactions and the electron-donating effect. Self-doped Spiro-OH8 was successfully applied as a HEM in polymer BHJ solar cells, showing PCE values up to 8.20%. This is an encouraging result as the performance is comparable to that based on the commercial PEDOT:PSS material. The phenolamine structure is an efficient building block for achieving highly efficient HEMs. Meanwhile, the activation of the phenolamine structure induced the radical state with an enhanced conductivity. This new design strategy might provide new access to developing novel and efficient semiconductors for organic electronics.
