Homogeneous photocatalysts, however, are very attractive in sense that their chemical and photochemical properties can be understood and tuned on molecular level. Moreover, in homogeneous systems catalysts may be covalently bound to photosensitizers, which leads to more efficient electron transfer. Molecular devices for water splitting based on such a systems are of great interest. In this review, we summarize recent progresses in the synthesis, properties and application of metal-based molecular catalysts for photoinduced hydrogen evolution in homogeneous systems.Mei WangProf. Mei Wang received her PhD in 1989 from Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics.

Energy consumption rate is predicted to rise significantly, up to 28–35 TW by 2050 from present state of about 13 TW, so access to primary energy will clearly be a crucial problem already in the next few decades.1 The conversion of solar energy into electricity or other forms of energy is a very promising way to solve this problem. Since the total solar energy that reaches the earth surface exceeds our total energy consumption by a factor of 10000, an attractive solution would be large scale conversion of solar energy to electricity and fuel. A lot of attempts were put to convert solar energy into electricity, especially after the discovery of new type of devices capable of utilizing solar energy light like dye-sensitized solar cells. Another way to utilize solar energy is water splitting with production of molecular hydrogen and oxygen. Molecular hydrogen is an ideal fuel because the only product of combustion is water when combustion is made in pure oxygen. A lot of scientific groups focused their attention on photocatalytic water splitting during last 30 years. It is important to emphasize that most of work in this field was devoted to heterogeneous photocatalytic systems, while homogeneous ones were poorly developed. However, during the past few years much progress has been achieved in developing and understanding homogeneous photocatalytic systems, which is the topic of the present perspective article.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen production with homogeneous catalysts based on non-precious metalsThe production of hydrogen on a large scale from renewable solar energy with low cost catalysts is an ideal method pursued by mankind for sustainable energy production.1–4 This challenging topic has attracted extensive attention during recent decades. While heterogeneous photocatalysis by multiple components has been extensively studied, there are relatively few reports on homogeneous catalysis of the light-driven hydrogen production by transition metal complexes before 2000.5–9 In most cases, either with hetero- or homogeneous catalyst systems, noble metal-based (Pt, Pd and Rh etc.) compounds were used as catalysts.10 Although homogeneous catalyst systems based on the first-row transition metals for photochemical hydrogen production have been scarcely reported last century, recently, increasing attention is attracted to the non-precious metal-based homogenous catalysts.11–182.1 Bio-inspired iron-based catalyst systemsIn recent years, the natural catalyst for hydrogen generation and utilization in many microorganisms, that is, hydrogenase enzymes, has been a highlight in the area of enzymatic and bioinorganic chemistry. Hydrogenases were used by Okura and co-workers as catalysts in the multicomponent systems of an electron donor, a photosensitizer, and an electron carrier.19,20 Recently, Moore and co-workers reported the photoinduced hydrogen production catalysed by the [FeFe]-hydrogenase ([FeFe]H2ase) in a photoelectrochemical bio-fuel cell.21 Although hydrogenases are more active and selective as compared to reported hetero- and homogeneous catalysts, they are not ideally suited for large-scale and long-term use because the reaction conditions are limited.22Among the several kinds of hydrogenases ([FeFe]-, [NiFe]-, and [Fe]-hydrogenases), [FeFe]H2ases, depicted in Fig. 1,23,24 seem to be more involved in the proton reduction to molecular hydrogen than other two kinds of hydrogenases. The catalytic activity of [FeFe]H2ases can reach 6000–9000 molecules H2 s−1 per site under optimal conditions.25 Inspired by the remarkable catalytic activity of [FeFe]H2ases for proton reduction to molecular hydrogen, many chemists are engaged in creating electro- and photochemical hydrogen production catalyst systems based on the diiron model complexes of the [FeFe]H2ase active site.26–29 In past a few years, various structural and functional [2Fe2S] model complexes have proved to be efficient catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen production,28–32 while photochemically active catalysts based on [2Fe2S] mimics are scarcely reported.16–18 Fig. 1  The structure of the active site (H-cluster) in [FeFe]H2ases. Iron-based catalyst systems covalently or coordinately linked to a photosensitizer. Complex Ru(bpy)32+ and its derivatives have been successfully used as a light harvesting unit in many light-driven hydrogen production systems.5–10,33,34 For the construction of photoactive catalysts, several ruthenium diiron dyads (1–4) were prepared (Fig. 2), where the [2Fe2S] model complexes of the [FeFe]H2ase active site are attached to Ru(bpy)32+ by different linkers.35–39 The initial motif is to build photoactive catalysts for hydrogen production, however, the diiron catalytic centers in these ruthenium diiron dyads cannot be directly reduced by the excited photosensitizer, which was quenched either by energy transfer or by unwanted reductive quenching from the diiron moiety.38 It is mainly because the reduction potentials of the diiron complexes are more negative than the oxidation potential of the excited state of the ruthenium complex, making the direct electron transfer from the excited photosensitizer to the catalyst thermodynamically unfavourable. Fig. 2  Diiron complexes covalently linked to the ruthenium-polypyridine photosensitizer. In addition to ruthenium-polypyridine complexes, a phenyl-substituted porphyrin and zinc-porphyrin complexes were also used as photosensitizers in the photoinduced electron transfer and hydrogen generation studies. Song and co-workers successfully prepared and well-characterized two light-driven dyad models (5 and 6, Fig. 3), in which the photosensitizer, either a tetraphenyl porphyrin (TPP) or a zinc-porphyrin complex (ZnTPP), is coordinately bonded to a diiron complex.40,41 Although it is possible that the marked quenching of the fluorescence bands of 5 and 6 in the steady-state emission spectra relative to those of their reference compounds TPP and ZnTPP is mainly due to the intramolecular electron transfer from the photoexcited porphyrin- or metalloporphyrin-type moiety to the coordinately bonded diiron complex, the proposed electron transfer processes are not experimentally verified by time-resolved spectroscopy. Fig. 3  Diiron complexes covalently or coordinately linked to the porphyrin photosensitizer. Recently, a non-covalent assembly (7) of a pyridyl-functionalized hydrogenase active site model and a zinc tetraphenylporphyrin was obtained and characterized.18 The photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer from the excited singlet state of the porphyrin to the diiron center was well verified by the fluorescence spectra and the laser flash photolysis technique. Because the two units, the zinc-porphyrin and the diiron complex, in the coordinately self-assembled dyad are able to separate from each other after the intramolecular electron transfer reaction, this dyad can effectively reduce the charge recombination and energy transfer as compared to covalently linked ruthenium-diiron molecular dyads. Visible light-driven dihydrogen generation was observed from the zinc-porphyrin diiron dyad 7. Although the turnover number (TON) is relatively low (0.2), the zinc-porphyrin diiron catalytic system is attractive because (1) no noble metal is involved in the catalytic system; (2) both catalyst and photosensitizer are based on bio-inspired mimics; and (3) it is the first photoactive hydrogenase model for successful light-driven dihydrogen generation using coordinately self-assembling principle.Photoactive catalysts, composed of diiron dithiolate complexes and zinc(II) porphyrins, were also described by Kluwer et al. very recently.42 These supramolecular systems were constructed by coordinately self-assembled chromophores and diiron complexes via pyridyl-modified phosphine ligands. Hydrogen evolution was detected upon irradiation with visible light of toluene solutions containing diiron complexes, zinc(II) porphyrins and [NiPr2EtH][OAc] (a proton source and sacrificial electron donor). The yield of hydrogen was found to be up to 30% with respect to the proton donor.Iron-based catalyst systems of three molecular components. Compared to the ruthenium diiron dyads, the advantages of the intermolecular three component system, composed of Ru(bpy)32+, a proper electron donor, and a diiron complex, are the easy preparation and the fact that the unwanted energy transfer and the reverse electron transfer from the diiron complex to the excited state of Ru(bpy)32+ could be slowed down. The reductant Ru(bpy)3+ was photogenerated via reductive quenching of the excited state of Ru(bpy)32+ with diethyldithiocarbamate anion dtc− as an electron donor. Consequently, further electron transfer reaction from Ru(bpy)3+ to the diiron dithiolate complexes [{(μ-SCH2)2X}{Fe(CO)3}2] (X = CH2, NCH2C6H5) occurred in the three-component system, resulting in the formation of Fe0FeI species.16 Such species are proposed to be crucial intermediates in electro- and photochemical hydrogen evolution catalysed by [2Fe2S] complexes.29,43 However, light-driven hydrogen generation could not been observed from the system because of protonation and decomposition of the ionic quencher dtc− in the presence of proton donor. Therefore, an acid-tolerant quencher ascorbic acid was used to replace the S-containing electron donor.Hydrogen was generated from the three-component system of Ru(bpy)32+, ascorbic acid, and an all-CO diiron complex 8 in action of light with λ > 400 nm (Fig. 4), in which ascorbic acid acts as a proton source and its ascorbate anion functions as a reductive quencher for *Ru(bpy)32+ to generate Ru(bpy)3+. The total amount of hydrogen evolved is 7.8 × 10−6 mol with 0.8 turnovers based on complex 8.17 One of the reason for relatively low activity is that the all-CO diiron complex 8 was gradually decomposed under irradiation. Fig. 4  The Fe-based homogeneous catalytic systems with ruthenium-polypyridine as photosensitizer for hydrogen generation. A special phosphine ligand, tris(N-pyrrolyl)phosphine (P(Pyr)3), was introduced to the diiron complexes to improve the photo-stability of diiron complexes. The reduction potentials of complexes 9 and 10 for the FeIFeI/Fe0FeI process match the thermodynamic requirement for intermolecular electron transfer from Ru(bpy)3+ to the diiron complex.33 With 9 and 10 as catalysts in a 1 : 1 CH3CN–H2O solution, the total turnovers for hydrogen evolution are 4.3 based on 9 and 86 based on Ru(bpy)32+ in a 3 h photolysis, and for the system with P(Pyr)3-disubstituted complex 10, the turnovers are 1.7 based on 10 and 34 based on Ru(bpy)32+.17 The photostabilities and catalytic activities of 9 and 10 are higher than that of the all-CO analogue 8. These results indicate that CO-displacement of the all-CO diiron complex by P(Pyr)3 ligand(s) improves the photostability and the catalytic activity of [2Fe2S] model complexes to a certain extent in the photocatalysis reaction.2.2 Cobalt-based catalyst systemsPhotocatalytic systems with cobalt-polypyridine complexes as catalysts. In the end of 1970’s, the catalyst systems of the Ru(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)32+ (11) as well as macrocyclic Co(II) complex (12) were used by Sutin and co-workers for photoreduction of water in an acidic aqueous solution with Eu(II) or ascorbate ion as reductive quenchers.5,6 These systems are the first homogeneous systems using non-precious metal-based catalysts for photochemical hydrogen generation. Further studies on [Ru(dmphen)3]2+ (13, dmphen = 4,7-dimethylphenanthroline)/Co(bpy)32+ system revealed that Co(bpy)32+ could oxidatively quench the excited state of [Ru(dmphen)3]2+ to generate the Co(I) species, which was capable of reducing protons from water to molecular hydrogen. The quantum yield of hydrogen for the [Ru(dmphen)3]2+/Co(bpy)32+ system is 0.29 in CH3CN/H2O solution with triethanolamine (TEOA) as electron sacrificer.9On the basis of the [Ru(dmphen)3]2+/Co(bpy)32+ system, Bernhard and co-workers replaced [Ru(dmphen)3]2+ by heteroleptic biscyclometallated(diimine) iridium complexes (Fig. 5).11,12 It was found that these heteroleptic iridium complexes were superior to ruthenium polypyridine derivatives. In a parallel comparison, the turnovers are up to 920 based on the iridium photosensitizer [Ir(F-mppy)2(bpy)]+ (F-mppy = 5-methyl-2-(4-fluoro)phenylpyridine) and 18 based on Co(bpy)32+, while it is 580 turnovers based on [Ru(dmphen)3]2+ and 12 turnovers based on Co(bpy)32+.11 The relative quantum yields of hydrogen determined in this work are 3 to 7 times as high as the results obtained with [Ru(dmphen)3]2+ as photosensitizer.11 With introduction of the CF3 group to the difluorophenylpyridine ligand and the t-butyl groups to the bipyridine ligand, both the lifetime and the reducing power of the excited iridium photosensitizer (14, Fig. 5) are apparently enhanced, resulting in a large improvement of hydrogen production efficiency. The quantum yield of hydrogen at 465 nm with the modified iridium complex as photosensitizer is 14 times as high as that obtained with [Ru(dmphen)3]2+ as a light-harvesting unit.12 Fig. 5  Heteroleptic iridium photosensitizers used by Bernhard's group. Photocatalytic systems with cobaloxime complexes as catalysts. Some cobaloxime complexes have been found to be very efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution.44–46 Therefore, cobaloximes are considered as good candidates of catalysts for photochemical hydrogen production. Lehn and co-workers pioneered the studies on homogeneous photogeneration of hydrogen using [Co(dmgH)2(OH2)2] (15, dmgH = dimethylglyoximate, Fig. 6) as catalyst with Ru(bpy)32+ as photosensitizer and TEOA as sacrificial electron donor in the DMF solution.7 The turnover based on the cobaloxime is 16 in a 1 h irradiation. Addition of 6 to 15 equivalents of the dmgH2 (dimethylglyoxime) ligand was found to be necessary to prevent complex 15 from dissociation and to replace the hydrogenated ligand formed by side reactions. Dissolution of CO2 in the reaction solution resulted in an increase of the hydrogen production efficiency about twice as that observed in the absence of CO2. It was proposed that this increase may be mainly a pH effect since CO2 dissolution was expected to decrease the apparent “pH” of the medium. Fig. 6  Structure of the cobaloxime complex [Co(dmgH)2(OH2)2]. Recently, Eisenberg and co-workers developed an efficient three-component system with the cobaloxime [Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl] (16) as catalyst, platinum terpyridylphenylacetylide complex (17) as photosensitizer, and TEOA as electron donor (Fig. 7).13 With increasing the concentration of electron donor (TEOA) to 2.4 × 104-fold as that of the platinum-based photosensitizer, the turnovers of 1000 based on platinum and 28 based on the cobalt catalyst were achieved after a 10 h irradiation (λ > 410 nm) in CH3CN–H2O solution at pH 8.5. Fig. 7  The cobaloxime catalyst and the platinum photosensitizer used by Eisenberg's group. The cobaloxime complex [Co(dmgBF2)2(OH2)2] (18) containing two BF2-bridges was found to be highly efficient for photo-generation of hydrogen with a rhenium complex [Re(CO)3Br(phen)] (phen = phenanthroline) as photosensitizer (Fig. 8) in the presence of the excess amounts of Et3N and Et3NH+BF4− in acetone under irradiation (λ = 380 nm).15 The maximum turnover is 273 based on both photosensitizer and catalyst using 600 equiv. of both Et3N and Et3NH+BF4− in a 15 h irradiation. The quantum yield of hydrogen is 0.16 at 412 nm. The catalytic activity and stability of this multicomponent catalyst system can compete with some previously reported platinum-based systems.47–50 Fig. 8  The cobaloxime catalyst and the rhenium photosensitizer used by Fontecave's group. Similar system, based on cobalt catalyst [Co(dmgH)2] and rhenium photosensitizer [Re(CO)3Br(bipy)], was recently described.51 The quantum yield of hydrogen is 26 ± 2%. The rate of hydrogen evolution was found to be dependent on the photon flux (a linear dependence) and the concentration of cobalt catalyst (a quadratic dependence).By replacing one of the axial H2O ligands of the cobaloxime with pyridine-functionalized ruthenium-polypyridine complexes, Fontecave and Artero et al. built a series of Ru–Co and Ir–Co heterobinuclear photocatalysts (20–24, Fig. 9) for photochemical hydrogen generation from Et3NH+BF4−.14,15 The Ru–Co dyads are more efficient in hydrogen production than their corresponding multicomponent systems under the same condition. Complex 21 containing the BF2-bridged Co(II) center is superior to 20 with the H-bridged Co(III) center because the Co(II) state in 21 is more easily reducible and more resistant towards the side reactions, such as acidic hydrolysis and hydrogenation. The supramolecular photocatalyst 21 with the [Ru(bpy)2(L-pyr)]2+ (L-pyr = (4-pyridine)oxazolo[4,5-f]phenanthroline) unit as photosensitizer performs up to 103 turnovers in the presence of 100 equiv. of both Et3N and Et3NH+BF4− in acetone during a 15 h irradiation (λ > 350 nm).14 The systems based on 20–22 are almost inactive under visible light irradiation. Substitution of dmphen ligands for bpy in the ruthenium unit makes the Ru–Co supramolecular catalyst (23) active in action of visible light (λ > 380 nm), but the turnover remains low. A significant enhancement of the catalytic activity was observed when the ruthenium-based photoactive moiety was replaced by the heteroleptic iridium unit. The total turnover reaches 210 based on 24 in the presence of 600 equiv. of both Et3N and Et3NH+BF4− in a 15 h irradiation,15 which is higher than those reported for the other noble metal-based supramolecular systems such as the Ru–Pt,52 Ru–Pd,53,54 and Ru–Rh photocatalysts.55 In comparison, the maximum turnover for the corresponding Ir–Co multicomponent system is 165 under the same condition and the quantum yield of hydrogen is 0.12. In common with the Ru–Co system reported by Lehn and co-workers,7 the photocatalytic activity of the dyads decreased by a factor of 1/3 with addition of water to the reaction medium. Fig. 9  Photosensitizer-cobaloxime supramolecular catalysts reported by Fontecave's group. 3 Photocatalytic hydrogen production with noble metal-based homogeneous catalystsFor the proton reduction to molecular hydrogen with noble metal-based homogeneous catalysts, both single and multicomponent systems have been investigated. In both systems, a photosensitizer S and a catalyst C are present (Fig. 10). It was found that single-component systems are more compact and robust than the multicomponent one. In multicomponent systems, electron mediators, such as methyl viologen, and a sacrificial electron donor (SED), such as TEA or EDTA are required. Fig. 10  Single- and multicomponent systems for proton photoreduction. Tertiary amines are widely used as SEDs in photocatalytic systems. The oxidation pathway has been investigated previously.56–58 For example, oxidation and degradation of TEA may be represented as follows (Scheme 1). In these processes, different radical and cationic species are involved, and they, together with products from their decomposition, can potentially influence the structures and reactivities of photosensitizers and catalysts. Scheme 1  Proposed reactions of TEA as a sacrificial electron donor in hydrogen photo-production systems. 3.1 Rhodium-based catalyst systemsSutin and co-workers reported the use of rhodium complex Rh(bpy)33+ in processes of photoinduced hydrogen formation in 1981.59 This complex, in combination with Ru(bpy)32+ and TEOA, can be reduced under irradiation with 450 ± 20 nm light to give rhodium(I) and hydrogen. On the basis of continuous and flash photolysis experiments, the mechanism was proposed. The quantum yields of hydrogen evolution (up to 0.11) were found to be dependent on pH and concentrations of Rh and Ru complexes.It was recently found by Bernhard and co-workers that the systems composed of cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes (25) as photosensitizers and tris-2,2′-bipyridyl rhodium(III) complexes (26) as catalysts (Fig. 11) are efficient in production of hydrogen from water.60 The effectiveness of these systems is impressive: turnovers more than 5000 with quantum yields up to 34% can be achieved. Authors noted that photoreaction conditions, such as solvents and sacrificial reductants, dramatically influence the performance of the catalytic systems. Triethylamine was found to be the most efficient sacrificial reductant, and the water–THF (80%) mixture is optimal as a reaction medium. Fig. 11  Ir–Rh catalysis systems reported by Bernhard's group. Homogeneous photocatalyst based on trinuclear ruthenium-rhodium complex has been reported by Brewer's group.55 In this supramolecular complex, [{(bpy)2Ru(dpp)}2RhCl2]5+, central rhodium(III) atom plays role of electron collector. Because of Ru → dpp and Ru → bpy charge transfer transitions, the complex is capable of absorbing visible light. Hydrogen was detected upon irradiation of the water/acetonitrile solution of this complex and N,N-dimethylaniline with visible light (470 nm). Authors assume that the active catalyst is rhodium(I) complex [(bpy)2Ru(dpp−)RhI(dpp)Ru(bpy)2]4+. Turnover number of 30 was reached. It is interesting to note that monometallic components of the trinuclear complex, [(bpy)2Ru(dpp)](PF6)2 and [Rh(dpp)2Cl2](PF6), are also capable of hydrogen evolution, but with much lower yield. Bromide complex, [{(bpy)2Ru(dpp)}2RhBr2]5+, turned out to be more efficient than analogous chloride photocatalyst (10.9 vs. 8.2 μmol H2 over a 4 h photolysis period).61 In addition, similar trinuclear Ru2–Rh, Ru2–Ir and Os2–Rh complexes with the series of bridging and terminal ligands were prepared and tested as photocatalysts in the presence of N,N-dimethylaniline, TEA or TEOA as an electron donor.62 The Ru2–Rh complexes, however, showed higher photocatalytic activity, up to 7.2 ± 0.8 μmol of H2 (total hydrogen produced).A promising approach to the hydrogen photo-evolution was developed by Nocera's group.10,63 This approach is based on the use of two-electron mixed-valence coordination complexes of the general formula Mn–Mn+2. Dirhodium 27 (Fig. 12) and diiridium complexes with different bridging ligands are capable of generating hydrogen from HCl or HBr under irradiation. It was found that dirhodium compounds can also function as a photocatalysts.64 Thus, the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from THF–HCl solution was observed upon irradiation with UV-vis light (λexc≥ 338 nm). The activation of Rh–Cl bond and photochemical instability of Rh0–RhII intermediates involved in the catalytic cycle play crucial roles in this system. Fig. 12  A dirhodium mixed-valence cluster reported by Nocera's group. 3.2 Platinum- and palladium-based catalyst systemsSakai and co-workers reported the synthesis of heterobinuclear Ru–Pt complex 28 (Fig. 13).52 Under irradiation (λ≥ 390 nm) of water solution of this complex, in combination with EDTA as sacrificial electron donor, evolution of hydrogen was detected with TON of 4.8. Fig. 13  A platinum(II) complex covalently bound to a ruthenium photosensitizer. At the same time, Rau and co-workers reported the synthesis and catalytic properties of Ru–Pd complexes 29 (Fig. 14).53 A bridging ligand between the metals was tetrapyridophenazine. Turnover number of 56 was achieved when water solution of the complex and triethylamine was irradiated with 470 nm light. The formation of zero-valent metals in the reduction is probably one of the reasons for low stability of platinum and palladium-based catalysts. It was also found that binuclear Ru–Pd complexes of this type can catalyse the selective reduction of tolane to cis-stilbene under the same conditions. Authors assume that reduction of tolane takes place at the palladium centre on the basis of fact that only cis isomer formed and Ru–Pd complex is inert in dark. Fig. 14  Palladium(II) complex covalently bound to the ruthenium photosensitizer. Another binuclear Ru–Pd complex 30 (Fig. 15), active as photocatalyst of hydrogen production, was reported by Hammarström's group.54 Hydrogen evolution was monitored upon irradiation with visible light (λ≥ 475 nm) of the solution of the complex in acetonitrile–triethylamine. No hydrogen was detected in dark; maximal turnover number was 30. Authors investigated the potential formation of colloidal palladium in this system by using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. On the basis of these measurements, the formation of colloidal palladium was confirmed. The appearance of the colloid correlates in time with hydrogen evolution. In conclusion, authors do not rule out that binuclear complex can function as homogeneous catalyst, but metallic palladium plays major role. These important results indicate that great care should be taken when interpreting the mechanism of hydrogen production catalysed by supramolecular systems. Fig. 15  A binuclear Ru–Pd complex reported by Hammarström's group. 4 Efforts to devices for photo-production of hydrogenIdeally, the development of catalytic systems for photoinduced hydrogen production should lead to creation of devices which can be practically used. Very recently, the literature about such devices started to appear. Hydrogenases catalyse the reversible reduction of protons to hydrogen, and this property can be used to substitute metallic catalysts like Pt or complex supramolecular catalysts. The device based on this idea was developed by Moore and co-workers.21 They used [FeFe]-hydrogenase absorbed on carbon felt as cathode and nanosized TiO2 (supported on conductive glass) with absorbed porphyrin sensitizer as anode. This device works similarly to dye-sensitized solar cell: absorption of photon is followed by the transfer of electron to the conduction band of TiO2 and then to the cathode where reduction of protons to hydrogen takes place. Principally, this device can be used to photochemically reform biomass to hydrogen.Another device, dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cell (Fig. 16), was designed by Mallouk's group very recently.65 In this cell, the photosensitizer, ruthenium(II) tris(bipyridine) complex is bound to colloidal IrO2·nH2O particles via PO3H2-groups, and dye-IrO2·nH2O colloid is absorbed onto the nanosized anatase TiO2. Upon irradiation with 450 nm light, rapid electron injection into TiO2 was observed. The oxidized dye is regenerated by IrO2·nH2O, and water reduces IrO2·nH2O at the same time to give oxygen. Anode is connected to the platinum cathode, where hydrogen evolution takes place. The evolution of oxygen and hydrogen was confirmed by gas chromatography. When bias voltage was applied, the current efficiency for oxygen generation was found to be 20%. These two examples clearly illustrate that in spite of relatively low efficiency of the developed photocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution, there is a trend to create working devices based on them. Fig. 16  Photoelectrochemical cell and Ru dye reported by Mallouk's group. OutlookDuring the past years, a large number of different homogeneous catalytic systems for hydrogen evolution driven by visible light were developed and investigated. In spite of this progress, a number of problems remain to be solved. Thus, long-term stability of homogeneous photocatalysts is an important issue especially from practical application point of view. One way to make hydrogen photo-evolution systems more robust is to avoid using electron mediators which allow electron transfer from photosensitizer to the catalyst. The possibility to covalently bind photosensitizer to the catalyst seems to be very promising approach to facilitate electron transfer and make system more stable. Supramolecular systems consisting of photosensitizer and catalyst which are bound to each other via hydrogen or coordinate bonding are of great interest as well.The nature of metal center of the catalyst plays a crucial role for the catalytic activity. In many cases, noble metal complexes, like platinum and palladium, have been used. In these systems, however, one cannot completely rule out the influence of metal particles formed during the photoreactions. This leads to an uncertainty if the catalytic process is truly homogeneous. The use of catalysts based on non-precious metals like cobalt and iron is probably more preferable from this point of view as well as future large scale applications.The development of new photosensitizers for hydrogen production systems is also one of the challenging problems. Three important directions to be improved should be mentioned here: (a) the design of photosensitizers capable of harvesting broader part of solar spectrum, having high molar extinction coefficient and long lifetime of excited state; (b) the improvement of photo-stability of sensitizers; (c) the development of metal-free organic photosensitizers.In most of catalytic systems for hydrogen photo-evolution, sacrificial electron donors are needed. Ideally, the reaction between sacrificial electron donor and photosensitizer can be used for water oxidation process leading to oxygen evolution. In this case, water will formally play the role of electron donor. A series of photocatalysts for water oxidation has been developed during last decade, so the target to combine two half-reactions, i.e. water oxidation and water reduction, does not seem to be unrealistic. The future studies will have to address the development of the devices capable of overall water splitting. The use of different nanostructured semiconductor supports to which photosensitizer can be attached is also attractive area to explore; first examples of such a systems discussed above have been shown to work.
