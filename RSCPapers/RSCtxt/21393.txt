    , Accepted 15th June 2020First published on 15th June 2020AbstractBroadband near-infrared CuInS2/ZnS quantum dots with up to 94.8% quantum yield were synthesized with fast precursor decomposition leading to monomer conversion improvement. In the mini-LED package, the device showed high power efficiency and stability was also demonstrated with a penetration test and vein imaging showing its potential biomedical application in the theranostics field.
Quantum dots (QDs) are promising materials for multiple fields in the next-generation environment-friendly era.1 Copper indium sulfide (CuInS2) consisting of elements from groups I, III, and VI has a lower toxicity than other types of QDs. The ternary structure of CuInS2 has high molecular vibrational energy level distribution states, thereby enhancing broadband emission performance.2 Its wavelength can be tuned from visible to near-infrared (NIR) regions by tuning size, composition, and surface modification.3 Wide applications of visible QDs, including single-electron transistors, solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs),4,5 lasers, single-photon sources, second-harmonic generation, quantum computing, and medical imaging, have been developed.6 Infrared materials, such as phosphors,7–9 lanthanide-doped nanoparticles,10 QDs,11–13 and carbon nanotubes,14 have high potential in LED applications. However, the poor quantum efficiency of NIR QDs remains a challenge in current research.15,16
NIR light is a non-invasive technique that is suitable for biomedical applications involving sensing, diagnosis, and therapy.17 Its good energy absorption capacity and low scattering enable maximum tissue penetration and reduce autofluorescence.18 The NIR region can be divided into three biological windows according to optical property: NIR-I (650–950 nm), NIR-II (1000–1350 nm), and NIR-III (1500–1850 nm). Information can be monitored with NIR-I via reflection and absorbance under different wavelengths. Blood and tissues have deep absorption capacities and scattering patterns for NIR-II, and thus NIR II has deeper penetration in living tissues. The transmissive ability of NIR-II shows a high noise ratio when used in live imaging. Therefore, fluorescent material emitting NIR-II has greater advantages in biological detection and in vivo imaging. However, water molecules have a great absorption effect in the infrared region above 1000 nm, and thus NIR-I improves imaging (treatment) efficiency, increases penetration depth, and reduces photoinduced tissue damage.19
The general trend in the LED chip industry is miniaturization, which has become a popular research topic in various industries and academia.20,21 A packaged material requires high power efficiency and stability. Our research methodology involved setting a mini-LED model and investigating the effects on our developed QD materials. In this research, NIR QDs with high quantum efficiency were synthesized, and their power efficiency and stability were compared with oxide nanophophors in a mini-LED model. Therefore, a packaged NIR QD mini-LED with better broadband emission performance is prepared to demonstrate its potential biomedical application in the theranostics field.
Ternary CuInS2 is the most common component among various I–III–V-based metal chalcogenide candidates for the colloidal synthesis of QDs, particularly as visible emitters in the typical range of yellow-to-deep red.22–24 To realize substantially deeper photoluminescence (PL) in the NIR region synthesis of lower-band-gap CuInSe225 and CuIn(Se,S)226,27 QDs has been explored earlier, successfully producing longer PL wavelengths than 800 nm. However, the PL quantum yields (QYs) of these QDs are insufficient even after multiple shelling; for example, 830 nm-emitting CuIn(Se,S)2/CdSeS/CdS26 and 960 nm-emitting CuIn(Se,S)2/ZnS QDs have QYs of 17% and 40%, respectively.27 Referring to our recent work, we achieved NIR emissivity from CuInS2 QDs by replacing the conventional trivalent cationic precursor of In acetate with In iodide (InI3) (see the synthesis of CuInS2/ZnS QDs in the Experimental section).28 According to the hard and soft acids and bases guideline, InI3 (hard acid–soft base) has a faster decomposition rate toward monomer conversion and thus is more reactive compared to indium acetate (hard acid–hard base); hence, InI3 secures NIR emission through the effective promotion of CuInS2 core growth. The results of the comparison between the absorption spectra of CuInS2 core and CuInS2/ZnS core/shell QDs (Fig. 1a) showed that ZnS shelling induced a spectral blue shift associated with bandgap increase. This effect is a universal phenomenon in I–III–VI metal chalcogenide QDs likely because of either a sole or combined factors, including the formation of Zn-alloyed CuInS2, reduction of the effective CuInS2 core by etching, and growth of an incidental ZnS shell by Cu+/In3+-to-Zn2+ cation exchange.29 The intended core/shell heterostructure instead of separate formation of two phases (i.e., CuInS2 and ZnS) after applying ZnS shelling is verifiable from the comparison of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CuInS2versus CuInS2/ZnS QDs (Fig. S1, ESI†). The present CuInS2/ZnS QDs exhibited a NIR PL peak of 816 nm (Fig. 1b), which became blue-shifted from 933 nm of the CuInS2 cores (Fig. S2, ESI†), being in line with the above blue-shift in absorption. The temporal stability of CuInS2/ZnS QDs (in hexane dispersion) under room storage was assessed by monitoring their PL for an extended period of time, resulting in 81% PL retention after 168 h (Fig. S3, ESI†). As commonly observed in other I–III–V QDs, the PL of CuInS2/ZnS QDs was substantially broad (i.e., 450 meV) and Stokes-shifted (i.e., 550 meV) relative to their absorption as a consequence of the radiative combination of photo-generated carriers via intragap states. In particular, a large Stokes shift is highly beneficial for alleviating inter-QD light reabsorption, which is a troublesome issue in visible color-converted QD-LED packages. The brown-black CuInS2/ZnS QDs dispersed in hexane turned red under UV light (Fig. 1c). The average size of the QDs was estimated using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) image to be 6.5 nm (Fig. 1d) (also refer to Fig. S4 (ESI†) for their size histogram). Besides, we further implemented the size-sorting of CuInS2/ZnS QDs via a conventional size-dependent precipitation method, by which six QD fractions in size sequence were obtained. In spite of a systematic blue-shift in PL with such repeated size-sorting processes, PL bandwidths of individual QD fractions were overall similar (Fig. S5, ESI†), indicating that their intragap state-associated radiative recombination is intrinsically responsible for broad PL. The CuInS2/ZnS QDs as color-converted nanomaterials needed to be pretreated from the dispersion state to a powder state before packaging. The different PLs between CuInS2/ZnS QDs in the dispersion and powder state are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The PL of the QD powder (896 nm) was markedly redshifted by nearly 80 nm compared with the QD dispersion (816 nm) due to the substantial light reabsorption among QDs in the powder state (Table S1, ESI†).30

The LED package 3535-type used had a size of 3.5 mm and contained 9 × 5 mil mini-LED chips. The mini-LED characteristics of ZnGa2O4:Cr3+,Sn4+ in mesoporous silica nanoparticles (ZGOCS@MSN) were investigated under 45 mA in the previous research.31 The PL spectrum of the device with the lighting photographs is shown in Fig. 2a. The difference in mini-LED characteristics between ZGOCS@MSN and CuInS2/ZnS QDs was clearly observed. The narrowband emission (in a blue line) was detected from 600 nm to 850 nm because of the 2E → 4A2 transition. CuInS2/ZnS QDs had an excellent PL QY of 94.8% (Fig. 2c and Fig. S7, ESI†) and exhibited broader emission and larger redshift than ZGOCS@MSN with a center wavelength of 858 nm and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 216 nm. The conversion efficiency of a blue LED chip was controlled to 18%. This step ensures that the nanomaterials absorb the same excitation energy from the blue LED chip for the comparison of the properties of ZGOCS@MSN and CuInS2/ZnS QDs. Corresponding to the different absorptivity of nanomaterials, the sol–gel ratio of this package was about 25% for ZGOCS@MSN and 18.5% for CuInS2/ZnS. The output power of the mini-LED is under 45 mA. This outcome shows the potential of CuInS2/ZnS as a color conversion device in Fig. 2b. However, ZGOCS@MSN, as a type of oxide nanophosphor, showed weak photoelectric properties (flatted curve), which indicates great power stability.

In the biomedical field, NIR light can deeply penetrate and exhibit the wide characteristic optical properties of an organism. The method of application can be divided into two parts roughly, using a NIR light-triggered photosensitizer or using a NIR light source directly. The applications of theranostics based on the mini-LED are promoted because of its non-invasiveness to the human body. The relationship between living cells and NIR optical properties is shown in Fig. 3a. The redox centers of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) in the human body play an important key in absorbing NIR energy. NIR photons can stimulate the electron transfer chain to approach the treatment of brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and depression.32 The PL of CuInS2/ZnS QDs is located in the NIR-I window, which can prevent thermal damage from the non-overlapping of water absorbance. The NIR technique is discussed with enthusiasm for non-invasive theranostics in the future, such as vein imaging and brain treatment. The NIR penetration test and vein imaging are exhibited with a CuInS2/ZnS QDs mini-LED in this research, and the experimental scheme is shown in Fig. 3b and c.

The setup for the penetration test was composed of a NIR light source (45 mA, 3 V), biological tissue (beef and author's hands), and a charge-coupled device (CCD), as shown in Fig. S8a (ESI†). The penetration depth of the CuInS2/ZnS QDs mini-LED was determined. Each slice of beef was approximately 0.3 cm to 0.5 cm (Fig. S8b, ESI†), and the PL intensity substantially decreased as the thickness of the beef increased. NIR light penetrated the samples and approached a maximum depth of 4.5 cm after blocking with twelve pieces of beef (Fig. 3d). The beef, as a simulated environment of biological tissue, was attempted in the penetration test. Many factors can alter the transmission of biological tissues in reality. The signal of photoluminesce can be detected with one hand (about 2 cm thickness) in front of the CCD, as shown in Fig. 3e. Hands consist of bones, muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and tendons that make it difficult for NIR to penetrate. Therefore, the decreasing trend of penetration depth is different from the comparison of beef and hands (Fig. 3f). Different noninvasive approaches, such as ultrasound, NIR spectroscopy, visible LED transillumination, and smartphone technology,33 have been developed. NIR with LED has been preferred because other methods are expensive or require complex techniques.34,35 A series of images before and after the arm was emitted with NIR mini-LED are shown in Fig. 3g. Veins were recognized through the NIR absorption of deoxyhemoglobin in the skin and presented as a dark line in the NIR image (red arrow: vein, yellow spot line: arm). Merging the NIR image with the surface picture resulted in overlapping. This research contributed two parts, one is the high quantum efficiency and stability with an excellent power output of the CuInS2/ZnS QDs mini-LED in the ultra-broadband NIR region and the other is the development of NIR lighting applications in the biomedical field.
In conclusion, CuInS2/ZnS QDs in the dispersion state belonging to the NIR-I window with a PL peak wavelength of 816 nm and FWHM of about 246 nm were synthesized. The QD powder showed an 80 nm redshift and an exceptional PL QY of 94.8%. Then, an ultra-broadband NIR QD mini-LED with an output power of 10.9 mW was fabricated by applying CuInS2/ZnS QDs as a luminescence converter. The high power efficiency and stability of the QDs in the mini-LED model were confirmed, and the penetration ability of the NIR QD mini-LED was approximately 4.5 cm in biological tissues. Vein imaging, as one of the applications of NIR QD mini-LEDs, was realized in this research providing a new novelty for miniaturization of devices in the future.
