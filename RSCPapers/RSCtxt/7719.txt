    , Accepted 5th January 2010First published on 3rd February 2010AbstractNew small band gap polymers incorporating diketopyrrolopyrrole units have been synthesized using Suzuki and Yamamoto polymerization. By alternating the electron-deficient diketopyrrolopyrrole units with different electron-rich aromatic segments, polymers were obtained with band gaps ranging from 1.24 to 1.77 eV in thin films. In field-effect transistors these polymers exhibit ambipolar charge transport with hole and electron mobilities up to 2.1 × 10−3 cm2/Vs and 1.6 × 10−4 cm2/Vs, respectively. The polymers were applied as electron donor in bulk heterojunction solar cells with [60]PCBM as electron acceptor to give a maximum power conversion efficiency of 1.7% under simulated standard solar light (AM1.5G, 100 mW/cm2). The morphology of the bulk heterojunction blend seems to limit the photovoltaic performance.
Introduction
In the last decade several new p-type semiconducting polymers have been applied in bulk heterojunction solar cells together with methanofullerene derivatives as n-type material to reach power conversion efficiencies in solar light approaching 7%.1–19 In designing polymers for polymer solar cells an intense and broad absorption, efficient generation of free charge carriers, fast transport of the charges to and easy collection at the electrodes have to be considered to enhance the performance. Preferentially, all these advantageous properties are combined in a single polymer that is also soluble enough to be processed from solution and leads to a favourable phase separated interpenetrating morphology when blended with the n-type material.
A strategy that increases the number of absorbed photons is to improve the overlap of the polymer absorption spectrum with the solar emission, which peaks around 1.77 eV. Hence, it is important to design polymers with an optical band gap between 1.3–1.8 eV and a high extinction coefficient.20–22 After absorbing a photon, the exciton created must dissociate into free charge carriers. Since the offset between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of polymer and fullerene represents – in first approximation22 – the driving force for charge separation, judicious positioning of the energy levels is critical. Generally, a LUMO-LUMO offset of 0.3–0.4 eV is thought to be sufficient to ensure efficient charge dissociation, provided that the offset of highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) is larger.20,21 At the same time, the HOMO level of the polymer should be positioned such that the maximum open-circuit voltage (Voc), which is determined by the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor,23,24 is as high as possible to conserve the energy of the absorbed photons. The next step is to transport the photogenerated holes and electrons to the corresponding electrodes, i.e. the holes through the polymer phase and the electrons through the fullerene phase. Since low hole mobility of the polymer is often the limiting factor,25–27 polymers with a high hole mobility are desirable for efficient collection of the charges at the electrodes.
In this paper we describe the synthesis and properties of a series of new small band gap polymers incorporating diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) (Fig. 1). In combination with appropriate electron-rich aromatic segments, the electron-deficient DPP unit can lead to small band gap alternating copolymers4,28–34 and oligomers35–38 with encouraging photovoltaic performance up to 4.7% due to a extended strong absorption spectra and high charge carrier mobilities.28,34 We have now copolymerized 3,6-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,5-dihydro-2,5-dialkylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP2T) with 9,9-dioctylfluorene (F) and 4,4-dioctylcyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) using Suzuki coupling and prepared its homopolymer in a Yamamoto reaction to yield a series of new DPP polymers (Fig. 1). The effect of the different electron-rich aromatic segments alternating with the DPP units on the optical and electrochemical properties is investigated. The lengths of the alkyl chains on the DPP unit were varied to tune solubility, morphology and (photo)physical properties. All polymers were tested for their charge carrier mobility in field-effect transistors and as p-type material in bulk heterojunction solar cells with [60]PCBM as complementary n-type material.

Experimental
Molecular weights were determined using size exclusion chromatography in HPLC-grade o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) at 80 °C against polystyrene standards on a Polymer Laboratories-GPC 120 high temperature chromatograph, a PD 2040 high-temperature light scattering detector and a Midas autosampler. A mixed-C 300 × 7.5 mm column was used, together with a pre-column. The flow rate was 1 mL/min and the injection volume 100 µL.
UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (scan rate = 100 mV/s) was performed on an Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat in a three-electrode single-compartment cell using ODCB containing 0.1 M TBAPF6 (Fluka) as electrolyte. The working electrode was a platinum disk, the counter electrode a silver rod and the reference electrode Ag/AgCl. Potentials are relative to Fc/Fc+.
Substrates for field-effect transistors were fabricated starting with heavily doped silicon wafers obtained from Siltronic AG. The wafers were thermally oxidized at 1000 °C until a 200 nm thermal oxide layer was grown. The layer thickness was confirmed by ellipsometry measurements and results in a dielectric capacitance per unit area of 17 nF/cm2. As source and drain electrode a 100 nm gold layer was applied. A 5 nm Ti film was used as adhesion layer. The electrodes were defined by standard photolithography and wet etching. The polymers were deposited onto the prefabricated gold source and drain electrodes with a channel width and length of 2500 and 10 µm by drop casting and were subsequently annealed at 110 °C during 1 h. Field-effect transistors were measured in vacuum (10−5 mbar) as function of bias using an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer
Photovoltaic devices were made by spin coating poly(ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios P, VP Al4083) onto pre-cleaned, patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (14 Ω per square) (Naranjo Substrates). The active layers were spin coated from different solvents or solvent combinations at various temperatures and concentrations. Furthermore, the polymer:[60]PCBM ratio was varied. The counter electrode, consisting of LiF (1 nm) and aluminium (100 nm), was deposited by vacuum evaporation at 3 × 10−7 mbar. The active area of the cells was 0.16 cm2. J–V characteristics were measured under ∼100 mW/cm2 white light from a tungsten-halogen lamp filtered by a Schott GG385 UV filter and a Hoya LB120 daylight filter, using a Keithley 2400 source meter. Short-circuit currents under AM1.5G conditions were estimated from the spectral response and convolution with the solar spectrum.4 The spectral response was measured under simulated 1 sun operation conditions using bias light from a 532 nm solid state laser (Edmund Optics). Monochromatic light from a 50 W tungsten halogen lamp (Philips focusline) in combination with monochromator (Oriel, Cornerstone 130) was modulated with a mechanical chopper. The response was recorded as the voltage over a 50 Ω resistance, using a lock-in amplifier (Stanford research Systems SR830). A calibrated Si cell was used as reference. The device was kept behind a quartz window in a nitrogen filled container.
Tapping mode AFM was measured in a NanoScope Dimension 3100 microscope (Veeco, Digital Instruments) or in a MFP-3D (Asylum Research) using PPP-NCHR probes (Nanosensors).
Results and discussion
Synthesis
PFDPP2T and PCPDTDPP2T were prepared as shown in Scheme 1via Suzuki polymerizations of 2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9,9-dioctylfluorene or 2,6-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-4,4-dioctylcyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene with 3,6-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,5-dihydro-2,5-dialkylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione39 having either 2-hexyldecyl (HD), 2-butyloctyl (BO) or 2-ethylhexyl (EH) alkyl side chains to vary the solubility. The polymers were fractionated by Soxhlet extraction with either hexane or CHCl3. The CHCl3 fraction contained the highest molecular weight polymer.

PFDPP2T-a (HD) was obtained with Mw = 62 kg/mol (Table 1), while the polymers with shorter side chains, PFDPP2T-b (BO) and PFDPP2T-c (EH), were obtained in somewhat lower molecular weights. Decreasing the length of the alkyl chains, lowers the solubility and possibly limits the formation of high Mw polymer. PCPDTDPP2T-b (BO) was obtained in a good molecular weight, Mw = 68 kg/mol, but that of PCPDTDPP2T-c (EH) was much lower, Mw = 12 kg/mol. PDPP2T-a was synthesized using bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) (Ni(cod)2) in a Yamamoto coupling. The reaction mixture instantly solidified upon addition of Ni(cod)2 and bipyridine and provided PDPP2T-a as a green solid with high molecular weight, Mw = 322 kg/mol. The high Mw limits the overall yield of the reaction by leaving a substantial amount of insoluble material in Soxhlet extraction.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The room-temperature absorption spectra recorded in ODCB (Fig. 2) show that the DPP copolymers cover a large part of the solar spectrum. The optical band gaps, defined by the onset of absorption (λonset), vary between 1.25 and 1.79 eV (Table 1). The smallest optical gap is obtained for PDPP2T-a, which starts to absorb around 1000 nm. Incorporating CPDT in the chain increases the optical band gap in ODCB to 1.35 eV for PCPDTDPP2T. For PFDPP2T the band gap increases to 1.79 eV. The higher degree of aromaticity of fluorene compared to CPDT decreases its electron donating character and reduces the conjugation. All polymers exhibit high specific extinction coefficients ε (50–60 L/g·cm, Table 1) at the maximum absorption (λmax). The polymers with less or shorter side chains possess a somewhat higher ε, since the specific extinction coefficient is defined as the absorbance per unit mass concentration. This is a more relevant measure for the absorption coefficient in a film than the absorbance per molar repeat unit as it accounts for the presence of non-absorbing alkyl chains.
 Fig. 2  Room temperature UV-vis absorption spectra of the DPP polymers in ODCB solution. 
The absorption spectra of the polymers in thin films (see ESI†) show relatively small shifts compared to their solutions in ODCB and consequently the optical band gaps (Table 1) are similar. Annealing the films had no significant effect. Only PCPDTDPP2T-b exhibited a bathochromic shift (36 nm) when going from solution to the solid state. Temperature dependent absorption spectra of PCPDTDPP2T-b in ODCB (see ESI†) revealed the disappearance of the peak at 850 nm along with a rather large hypsochromic shift, when increasing the temperature from 20 to 100 °C. This provides evidence of aggregation of PCPDTDPP2T-b in ODCB at ambient temperature while at 100 °C, the polymer seems to be molecularly dissolved. The aggregate absorption is the dominating absorption peak in solid state. Also PFDPP2T and PDPP2T-a display different optical spectra at 20 and 100 °C (see ESI†) but the hypsochromic shift of λmax and λonset upon heating from 20 to 100 °C is much smaller than for PCPDTDPP2T-b.
Cyclic voltammetry was performed for the polymers dissolved in ODCB at a concentration of 1 mM and the results are collected in Table 1. The electrochemical band gap was determined as the difference between the onsets of the oxidation and reduction waves (Ecvg = Eoxonset − Eredonset). The electrochemical gap correlates well with the optical band gap of the molecularly dissolved polymers (Table 1). The DPP polymers possess very similar reduction potentials between −1.60 and −1.50 V, which indicates that the LUMO is more localized on the diketopyrrolopyrrole acceptor.40 The only exception is PDPP2T-a, which has a lower reduction potential of −1.25 V, possibly caused by interaction between adjacent diketopyrrolopyrrole units in the chain. The easier reduction makes PDPP2T-a a potential n-type material in solar cells since its electron affinity approaches that of [60]PCBM, which has a Eredonset of −1.07 V versus Fc/Fc+. However, the options for a complementary p-type polymer might be limited since its oxidation potential of 0.05 V requires a complementary donor polymer with a rather low oxidation potential to ensure efficient charge separation.41
As expected, the oxidation potentials strongly depend on the chemical nature of the donor unit. The electron-rich CPDT unit in PCPDTDPP2T sets Eoxonset between −0.01 and −0.05 V, while the more aromatic fluorene in PFDPP2T increases Eoxonset to 0.19 to 0.24 V which will provide a higher Voc when used in solar cells.
Field-effect transistors
The charge carrier mobilities of the DPP polymers were measured in a field-effect transistor (FET) geometry. As an example, the transfer characteristics of PDPP2T-a are depicted in Fig. 3. The transistor exhibits clear signature of ambipolar behaviour, as shown by the V-shape of the saturated transfer curves with hole currents dominating at negative gate voltages and electron currents at positive gate bias, The mobility, µ, was calculated in the saturation regime from the slope of the linear fit of the plot versusVG and values are collected for all DPP polymers in Table 2. For PDPP2T-a hole and electron mobilities are both in the 10−4 cm2/Vs range. PCPDTDPP2T-b which exhibits aggregate formation in solution, provides the highest field-effect with µhole = 2.1 × 10−3 cm2/Vs, respectively.

Solar cells
The DPP polymers were applied in bulk heterojunction solar cells with [60]PCBM as electron acceptor. The best photovoltaic performance obtained for each polymer is summarized in Table 2. Almost all blends showed the highest efficiencies when spin coated from a solvent mixture. Processing from single solvents such as CHCl3, chlorobenzene (CB) or ODCB resulted in inferior device characteristics.
Solar cells made from the three PFDPP2T polymers with [60]PCBM gave the best performance when processed from CHCl3/ODCB (4:1); the corresponding J–V curves are depicted in Fig. 4a. In this series, PFDPP2T-c provides the highest efficiency with a high Voc of 0.91 V (consistent with the high oxidation potential, Table 1). The short-circuit current density was Jsc = 2.35 mA/cm2 (Fig. 4a) under 100 mW/cm2 white light illumination. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) reaches over 15% in the 600–700 nm range. Convolution of the spectral response (SR) (Fig. 5a) with the AM1.5G spectrum affords an estimate of Jsc(SR) = 2.41 mA/cm2 under standard solar light conditions (AM1.5G, 100 mW/cm2), giving an estimated power conversion efficiency of 0.9%. At first sight it is rather surprising that PFDPP2T-c shows the best performance and the highest current, because it has the lowest hole mobility in this series, but – as will be shown below – the morphology of the bulk heterojunction is more favourable.

PCPDTDPP2T possesses a lower oxidation potential than PFDPP2T and therefore produces a lower Voc in the 0.6 V range in combination with [60]PCBM (Fig. 6b). PCPDTDPP2T-b:[60]PCBM blends give a very high FF of 0.7, virtually independent of layer thickness (0.69 ± 0.01 for a layer thickness between 76 and 235 nm, see ESI†). The short-circuit current density, however, maximizes at Jsc(SR) = 2.19 mA/cm2 for rather thin layers (∼80 nm) and is reduced by more than a factor of two when the layer thickness was increased above ∼120 nm (see ESI†). The low photocurrent limits the device performance to 0.9%. The moderate performance came rather unexpected since the extinction coefficient, FET mobility and LUMO-LUMO offset (0.43 eV) level are all favourable. The reason is found in the morphology of the active layer as discussed below.

The best solar cell for the DPP polymers presented here has been obtained for PCPDTDPP2T-c. Spin coating PCPDTDPP2T-c:[60]PCBM from CHCl3/trichlorobenzene (TCB) (3:1) at 60 °C provided a cell with Jsc = 5.64 mA/cm2 [estimated AM1.5 Jsc(SR) = 5.73 mA/cm2], Voc = 0.61 V and FF = 0.49, and η = 1.7%. The EQE, depicted in Fig. 5b, extends to about 950 nm and exhibits maxima in the 400–500 nm and 700–900 nm range that exceed 20%. The increase in photocurrent at reverse bias (Fig. 4b) suggests field-assisted collection of charges and indicates that charge generation is more efficient than inferred from the short-circuit current.
For PDPP2T-a the small LUMO-LUMO offset with [60]PCBM of 0.18 eV appears to be an insufficient driving force for charge separation. Consistently, the PDPP2T-a:[60]PCBM cell give a low short-circuit current, Jsc(SR) = 0.76 mA/cm2, which is mainly generated by [60]PCBM since the EQE (Fig. 5b) reveals the absence of a photoresponse beyond 750 nm; the wavelength at which the polymer starts to absorb. As was shown earlier,42,43 a driving force below 0.2 eV limits or even prevents charge dissociation at the polymer–fullerene interface. However, the free charge carriers that are created seem to be extracted relatively efficiently, as is indicated by a rather good FF of 0.58.
Morphology of the blends

Fig. 6 shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) height images of the active layers of the solar cells shown in Fig. 4. AFM reveals the topography of the blend and generally gives a good first insight into morphology of the active layer.44
For blends of the three PFDPP2T polymers with [60]PCBM the AFM height images (Fig. 6a–c) reveal substantial surface roughness up to 30 nm and relative large features. The PFDPP2T-a:[60]PCBM blend exhibits blobs with diameters up to 200–300 nm (Fig. 6a) that can be assigned to crystalline [60]PCBM domains.15,45,46 These large domains reduce the interface area and limit Jsc.15,45–51 The PFDPP2T-b:[60]PCBM blend shows holes at the surface that are hundreds of nanometres wide and over 1 µm long with a depth of several tens of nanometres. The most homogeneous, but morphologically still suboptimal, film in this series is obtained for PFDPP2T-c:[60]PCBM (Fig. 6c). As this blend also provides the highest photocurrent, it suggests that the more intimate mixing increases the photovoltaic performance. The large phase separation in the PFDPP2T-a:[60]PCBM blend likely originates from a large difference in solubility between the polymer and [60]PCBM in the solvent from which the blend is processed. If the rate of crystallization of [60]PCBM is higher than the rate for the polymer to aggregate, [60]PCBM clusters can form and give a coarse phase separation. The shorter side chains of PFDPP2T-b and PFDPP2T-c reduce the solubility of the polymer and increase its tendency to aggregate and thereby give a more homogeneous mixing.
Similar arguments may apply to the films of PCPDTDPP2T-b or PCPDTDPP2T-c with [60]PCBM (Fig. 6d,e) where the large morphological differences correlate with the distinctly different photovoltaic performance. The PCPDTDPP2T-b:[60]PCBM blend (Fig. 6d) exhibits large holes of several hundred nanometres wide and a length up to 2 µm. The height difference up to 30 nm makes the film, with a thickness of 76 nm, very rough. On the other hand, the surface of the PCPDTDPP2T-c:[60]PCBM blend films (Fig. 6e) is rather smooth and appears more homogeneous, suggesting more intimate mixing and correlating with the increased Jsc. Like for PFDPP2T, the best performance of PCPDTDPP2T is obtained for the derivative with shorter side chains.
For PCPDTDPP2T-b:[60]PCBM blends a wide range of processing conditions was explored to possibly change the morphology and further enhance device performance. Spin coating from hot (100 °C) ODCB instead of CHCl3 gave similar morphologies (see ESI†), although the size of the features is reduced. On the other hand, spin coating from CHCl3/TCB (3:1) at 60 °C gave rise to an entirely different, rather smooth surface morphology with fibre-like features (see ESI†). Surprisingly and despite the different morphology, solar cells of PCPDTDPP2T-b:[60]PCBM (1:3) processed from TCB/CHCl3 (1:3) at 60 °C gave a photovoltaic performance (FF = 0.63, Voc = 0.6 V Jsc(SR) = 2.11 mA/cm2, η = 0.8%) similar to the device made from CHCl3 listed in Table 2.
Conclusions
A series of small band gap polymers (PFDP2T, PCPDTDPP2T, and PDPP2T) based on electron deficient diketopyrrolopyrrole units, alternating with different electron-rich aromatic segments, has been synthesized with different branched side chains. The optical band gaps for these DPP polymers varied from 1.77 to 1.24 eV in the solid state and their absorption covers a large part of the solar spectrum. The redox potentials are favourable for photoinduced electron transfer to [60]PCBM with LUMO-LUMO offsets of 0.4–0.5 eV, except for PDPP2T-a where the offset of 0.2 eV was found to be inadequate for proficient charge separation. The oxidation potentials of PFDPP2T and PCPDTDPP2T lead to Voc's of up to 0.9 and 0.6 V in solar cells with [60]PCBM, which implies relatively low thermal energy losses considering their optical band gaps of 1.8 and 1.4 eV. In FETs the DPP polymers show ambipolar transport with hole mobilities up to 10−3 cm2/Vs.
Despite these favourable energy level and transport characteristics, the performance of the DPP polymers in solar cells with [60]PCBM is only moderately good, with a maximum efficiency of 1.7% for PCPDTDPP2T:[60]PCBM blends. The prime reason for this is the non-ideal morphology of blend films, which seems to be generally coarser than required for excellent performance, despite careful optimization of device processing conditions. This emphasizes the importance of morphology and accentuates our – as yet – limited understanding to rationally design and exploit the correlation between polymer structure, molecular weight, aggregation, morphology and photovoltaic performance in these bulk-heterojunction blends.
