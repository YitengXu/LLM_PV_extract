    , Accepted 14th March 2018First published on 14th March 2018AbstractA sample of Co3O4 mesoporous nanorods (Co3O4-MNR) with a considerable number of Co2+ vacancy defects was prepared by a facile method. Co3O4-MNR exhibits highly effective photothermocatalytic activity and excellent durability for the gas-phase oxidation of benzene (a recalcitrant poisonous air pollutant) under UV-visible-infrared illumination from a Xe lamp. It is discovered for the first time that the presence of Co2+ vacancies in Co3O4-MNR massively enhances the photothermocatalytic activity of Co3O4. Compared to a commercial Co3O4 sample (Aladdin) with a smaller number of Co2+ vacancies and TiO2 (P25), the CO2 production rate of Co3O4-MNR is massively increased by 165 and 309 times, respectively. Co3O4-MNR exhibits efficient photothermocatalytic activity for benzene oxidation even under the visible-infrared illumination of λ > 690 nm. The catalytic oxidation of benzene on Co3O4-MNR under the illumination of the Xe lamp follows a mechanism of solar-light-driven thermocatalysis. The experimental evidence of CO-TPR as well as theoretical evidence of density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the presence of Co2+ vacancies in Co3O4-MNR significantly increases the activity of the lattice oxygen in Co3O4, thus massively promoting the thermocatalytic activity of Co3O4. Interestingly, a novel photoactivation on Co3O4, quite different from the conventional photocatalysis of semiconductor photocatalysts such as TiO2, is discovered to considerably increase the solar-light-driven thermocatalytic activity of Co3O4-MNR. By combining the experimental evidence of isotope labeling, CO-TPR, and FTIR with the DFT calculations, we obtain a deep insight into the novel photoactivation: the illumination from the Xe lamp enhances the activity of the lattice oxygen in Co3O4-MNR, thus considerably promoting the solar-light-driven thermocatalytic activity of Co3O4-MNR.
Introduction
The use of inexhaustible solar energy for environmental purification and fuel production by photocatalysis is a very important objective for a sustainable society.1–4 The majority of documented photocatalysts can merely use UV or part of visible light.1–9 Continuous efforts have been made to design photocatalysts with a wide spectral response up to the infrared region, which accounts for 50% of solar light energy.10–15 Designing photocatalysts with a narrow band gap provides a feasible approach for the objective.12–15 Among photocatalysts, Co3O4 as a p-type semiconductor with a narrow bandgap (1.2–2.1 eV) has attracted attention. Various nanostructured Co3O4 materials and its nanocomposites were reported to exhibit photocatalytic activity for pollutant photodegradation,16–18 H2 production,19 and CO2 reduction20,21 under UV or visible light illumination. However, there have been no reports about infrared photocatalysis on Co3O4 up to now. The problem of Co3O4 as a photocatalyst for environmental purification is the relatively low redox potential of its photogenerated holes (2.44 eV vs. NHE),16 which is insufficient to oxidize hydroxyl (˙OH, H+/H2O = 2.73 V at pH = 7)22 and recalcitrant pollutants with high redox potential. Thus, only easily degradable pollutants with low redox potential (e.g. dyes) were reported to be photodegraded on Co3O4 and its nanocomposites,16–18 which limits their wide application in environmental purification. It is highly desirable and greatly challenging to develop a novel catalytic principle different from the well-known photocatalysis for overcoming the problem.
On the other hand, Co3O4 is an attractive thermocatalyst for environmental purification. Various nanostructured Co3O4 materials have been prepared for the catalytic oxidation of CO, methane, propane, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), etc.23–31 It is reported that the catalytic activity of nanostructured Co3O4 is influenced by its morphology, exposed crystal facets, surface area, reducibility, lattice oxygen activity, etc.23–31 Some nanostructured Co3O4 materials were reported to exhibit efficient low temperature catalytic activity for CO oxidation.23,24 However, for the catalytic oxidation of recalcitrant methane, methane, propane, and VOCs, a higher reaction temperature (usually above 250 °C) is required for the reactions to proceed.25–31 The higher reaction temperature together with a high flow rate of the pollutant feed stream causes high energy consumption. The utilization of inexhaustible solar energy to drive thermocatalytic reactions on Co3O4 would provide an effective and energy-saving strategy for environmental purification and chemical synthesis. The key to realizing this strategy is to search for an approach to effectively improve the catalytic activity of nanostructured Co3O4.
Recently, defect chemistry and engineering in metal oxides have been attracting intensive interest as they are important to tune the catalytic performance. It is documented that the type and concentration of defects significantly influence the photocatalytic/catalytic performance of catalysts, such as TiO2,32 CeO2,33 MnO2,34,35 Co3O4,36,37 BiOCl,38etc. For instance, Wang et al. prepared a Co3O4 electrocatalyst with a large number of oxygen vacancy defects for water oxidation by a plasma engraving method, and reported that oxygen vacancies on the Co3O4 surface improved the electrocatalytic activity.36 Yang et al. reported that the existence of oxygen vacancy defects in Co3O4 caused the formation of new gap states in which the electrons previously associated with the Co–O bonds tended to be delocalized, thus enhancing the electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity for water oxidation.37
Herein, we develop a facile approach to prepare Co3O4 mesoporous nanorods (Co3O4-MNR) with a considerable number of Co2+ vacancy defects. Co3O4-MNR exhibits highly efficient photothermocatalytic activity and excellent durability for the gas-phase oxidation of benzene (a recalcitrant poisonous air pollutant) under full solar spectrum illumination from a Xe lamp. It is discovered that the presence of Co2+ vacancy defects in Co3O4-MNR massively enhances the photothermocatalytic activity of Co3O4. Compared to a commercial Co3O4 sample (Aladdin) with a smaller number of Co2+ vacancies and TiO2 (P25), the CO2 production rate of Co3O4-MNR is massively increased by 165 and 309 times, respectively. Co3O4-MNR exhibits efficient photothermocatalytic activity for benzene oxidation even under the visible-infrared illumination of λ > 690 nm. Interestingly, a novel photoactivation, quite different from the conventional photocatalysis of semiconductor photocatalysts such as TiO2, is discovered to considerably increase the solar-light-driven thermocatalytic activity of Co3O4-MNR. By combining the experimental and theoretical evidence of isotope labeling, CO-TPR, FTIR, and DFT calculations, the origin of the massive enhancement in the photothermocatalytic and thermocatalytic activity due to the presence of Co2+ vacancy defects in Co3O4-MNR and the novel photoactivation on Co3O4-MNR are revealed. To the best of our knowledge, the massive enhancement in the photothermocatalytic and thermocatalytic activity due to the presence of Co2+ vacancy defects in Co3O4 and the novel photoactivation on Co3O4 have not been reported up to now.
Experimental
Preparation
A sample of Co3O4 mesoporous nanorods was prepared according to the following procedure. 2.5151 g of cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (Co(Ac)2·4H2O) was dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water under magnetic stirring. 1.5159 g of urea was dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water under magnetic stirring. The solutions of Co(Ac)2 and urea were mixed in a 500 mL beaker. The beaker covered with a polyethylene film was placed in an electric oven at 90 °C and kept at 90 °C for 48 h. The resultant precipitate was filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried at 90 °C. The obtained powder was calcined at 230 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace.
Characterization
The crystalline structure of the Co3O4 samples was determined on a Rigaku D/max diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Their morphology was observed on a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-100CX). Their specific surface area and pore volume were measured on a physisorption instrument (ASAP2020) using N2 absorption at −196 °C. The valence states of Co in the Co3O4 samples were analyzed on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, VG Multilab 2000) using Mg Kα radiation. Their diffuse reflectance UV-Vis-IR absorption spectra were obtained on a spectrophotometer (Lambda 750). The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum of the samples was recorded on an FA200 spectrometer at 9152.4 MHz at room temperature.
The total amount of Co in the Co3O4 samples was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on an ICP-OES spectrometer (PerkinElmer Optima 4300DV). The total amount of Co3+ in the Co3O4 samples was measured by chemical analysis according to the following procedure. 0.0100 g of the Co3O4 sample was added to 10 mL of a mixed solution of H2SO4 and H3PO4 with a volume ratio of 1:1. 10 mL of 0.0500 mol L−1 (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 was added to the mixture. The mixture was purged with a flow of high purity N2 and heated under stirring until the Co3O4 sample was dissolved, and Co3+ in the Co3O4 sample was completely reacted with an excessive amount of Fe2+ in an (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 standard solution. After being cooled to ambient temperature, the unreacted Fe2+ in the (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 solution was titrated using a standard solution of K2Cr2O7 (obtained by dissolving 0.0982 g of dried K2Cr2O7 in 100 mL of distilled water).
CO temperature programmed reduction (CO-TPR) of the Co3O4 sample and O2 temperature programmed oxidation (O2-TPO) of the reduced Co3O4 sample in the dark were conducted on a TP5080 multifunctional adsorption apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using a quartz tube reactor at one end of which a quartz window was linked. The setup and measurement procedure were detailed in the reported studies.39,40 The amount of the Co3O4 sample used in the CO-TPR and O2-TPO experiments was 0.0100 g. For the O2-TPO experiment, the Co3O4 sample was pre-reduced at 270 °C for 30 min in a flow of 5 vol% CO/He.
To investigate whether UV-Vis-IR illumination could affect the CO-TPR behavior of the Co3O4-MNR sample, a Xe lamp (CHF-XM500) used as a light source, placed in front of the quartz window of the quartz tube reactor, was turned on. The emission from the Xe lamp has a spectral profile similar to that of solar light.41 In this case, the amount of the Co3O4-MNR sample was 0.0050 g. The light intensity was 511.4 mW cm−2.
Photothermocatalytic activity
The measurement of the photothermocatalytic activity of the samples for the gas-phase oxidation of benzene was performed on a cylindrical reaction reactor with a quartz window under the illumination from the Xe lamp. The amount of the Co3O4 samples was 0.1000 g. The amount of benzene injected into the reactor was 8.0 μL. The reactant (benzene) and product (CO2) were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC9560). The reactor, the measurement procedure, and the analysis conditions were detailed in the reported studies.41,42 The light intensity of the illumination from the Xe lamp was measured using an optical power meter (Newport 1918-R). The light intensity of the UV-Vis-IR illumination from the Xe lamp is 511.4 mW cm−2. To study the effect of the light intensity of the UV-Vis-IR illumination from the Xe lamp on the photothermocatalytic activity of the Co3O4-MNR sample, the light intensity of the UV-Vis-IR illumination from the Xe lamp was changed from 347.4 to 586.7 mW cm−2. In order to measure the photothermocatalytic activity of the Co3O4-MNR sample under the Vis-IR illumination from the Xe lamp, a corresponding long-wave pass filter was placed in front of the quartz window of the reactor. The light intensities of the Vis-IR illumination of λ > 420, 560, and 690 nm are 555.6, 461.7, and 373.8 mW cm−2, respectively.
The photocatalytic activity of the Co3O4-MNR sample for the gas-phase oxidation of benzene at near ambient temperature was measured on the reactor under the UV-Vis-IR illumination from the Xe lamp according to the procedure reported in the literature.42
Isotope labeling experiment
The isotope labeling experiment for the oxidation of benzene (12C61H6) by 18O2 on the Co3O4-MNR sample under the UV-Vis-IR illumination from the Xe lamp was conducted on the setup illustrated in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The photothermocatalytic reactor was connected to a FTIR gas cell placed on an infrared spectrometer (Nicolet 6700). 0.050 g of the Co3O4-MNR sample was put in the reactor. After the reactor and system were purged using high purity N2, 40 mL of 18O2 and 260 mL of high purity N2 were flowed into the system by the corresponding gas bags, and 8 μL of benzene was injected into the reactor. The micro-pump was turned on to circulate the reactants between the reactor and the FTIR gas cell. Then, the Xe lamp was switched on and the FTIR spectra of the mixture of the reactants and products were recorded at a known time.
After the 18O2 isotope experiment, the used Co3O4-MNR sample was heated in an atmosphere of 12C16O and N2 on the setup illustrated in Scheme S2.† The procedure was as follows: 0.032 g of the used Co3O4-MNR sample was put in a quartz tube reactor. After the reactor and system were purged using high purity N2, 10 mL of 12C16O and 290 mL of high purity N2 were flowed into the system by the corresponding gas bags. The micro-pump was turned on to circulate the reactants between the reactor and the FTIR gas cell. Then, the quartz tube reactor was heated at a rate of 5 °C min−1, and the FTIR spectra of the mixture of the reactants and products were recorded at a known temperature.
Thermocatalytic activity
The thermocatalytic activity of the Co3O4 samples for benzene oxidation at different temperatures in the dark without illumination was measured on a gas-phase reaction apparatus (WFS-2015) using a quartz tube reactor, at one end of which a quartz window was linked.39,40,42 The amount of the Co3O4 samples was 0.0500 g. A feed stream of 2.0 g m−3 benzene and 20.8 vol% O2/N2 as the balance gas was fed into the reactor at a flow rate of 40 mL min−1.
To study the effect of illumination on the thermocatalytic activity of the Co3O4-MNR sample, the Xe lamp, placed in front of the quartz window of the reactor, was turned on. In this case, the amount of the Co3O4-MNR sample was 0.0125 g. The irradiation intensity was 511.4 mW cm−2. The setup and measurement procedure were detailed in our previous work.42
DFT calculation method
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to investigate Co3O4 by using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional and projected augmented wave pseudopotentials43,44 which were included in a Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP 5.3). Orbital-dependent corrections for the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion among the localized 3d electrons of Co in Co3O4 were introduced by using the DFT + U method with a Co 3d Ueff value of 2.0 eV.45 A 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh was used for summations over the Brillouin zone. The kinetic energy cutoff was 400 eV. The convergence criterion for the electronic relaxation was 10−4 eV, and the convergence criterion for the ionic relaxation was 10−3 eV Å −1.
Results and discussion
Characterization
The sample of Co3O4 mesoporous nanorods was prepared by reaction between cobalt acetate and urea at 90 °C, followed by calcination at 230 °C (see the Experimental). As shown in Fig. 1A, the XRD patterns of Co3O4-MNR are indexed to a pure spinel structure of Co3O4 (JCPDS 09-0418). The average crystal size of Co3O4-MNR, calculated according to the Scherrer formula (L = 0.89λ/βcosθ), is 12.0 nm. SEM images show that Co3O4-MNR has a nanorod morphology with lengths up to 1.3 μm and diameters up to 70 nm (Fig. 1B). The TEM image demonstrates that Co3O4 nanorods consist of closely contacted nanoparticles among which there are many mesopores (Fig. 1C). The HRTEM image shows that Co3O4 nanoparticles have a lattice spacing of 0.467 nm corresponding to the {111} facets (Fig. 1D). The mesoporous microstructure of Co3O4-MNR is proved by N2 adsorption (Fig. S1†). Co3O4-MNR has an average pore size of 7.8 nm and a total pore volume of 0.45 cm3 g−1. Its BET surface area is 222.6 m2 g−1.

The chemical states of Co in Co3O4-MNR were analyzed by XPS. Co3O4-MNR exhibits two strong peaks at 779.6 and 794.6 eV which are assigned to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of Co2+ or Co3+ (Fig. S2†), respectively. It also exhibits two broad weak peaks around 786.3 and 804.3 eV which are assigned to the satellite peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively.46 The spinel structure of Co3O4 has two types of cobalt, such as, octahedral Co3+ and tetrahedral Co2+,23 both of which contribute to the XPS peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2. For a perfect Co3O4 spinel crystal, the molar ratio of Co2+ and Co3+ is 1:2.23 However, it is difficult to identify the molar ratio of Co2+ and Co3+ by fitting their XPS spectra due to the small difference in their binding energies.46
In order to determine the molar ratio of Co2+ and Co3+ in the Co3O4 sample, the total amount of Co was measured by ICP-OES. The amount of Co3+ was measured by chemical analysis based on the following reactions, by which Co3+ in the Co3O4 sample is reduced to Co2+ by excessive Fe2+ in a standard (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 solution, and the unreacted Fe2+ is titrated using a standard K2Cr2O7 solution.47Co3+ + Fe2+ = Co2+ + Fe3+Cr2O72− + 6Fe2+ + 14H+ = 2Cr3+ + 6Fe3+ + 7H2O.
The molar ratio of Co2+/Co3+ in Co3O4-MNR is 1:3.17, which is much lower than that in a perfect Co3O4 crystal (1:2). This result indicates the presence of a considerable number of Co2+ vacancy defects in Co3O4-MNR. However, the above results of XRD and HRTEM show that the presence of Co2+ vacancy defects does not change the spinel structure of Co3O4-MNR.
The presence of a considerable number of Co2+ vacancy defects in the Co3O4-MNR sample was further confirmed by EPR. The EPR result shows that the Co3O4-MNR sample has a very weak EPR signal (Fig. S3†), indicating a low concentration of high-spin Co2+ (with unpaired electrons) in tetrahedral sites.48
Photothermocatalytic activity
The photothermocatalytic activity of Co3O4-MNR for the gas-phase oxidation of benzene (a typical carcinogenic and recalcitrant air pollutant) as a model reaction under UV-Vis-IR illumination from a Xe lamp was evaluated. Co3O4-MNR exhibits a highly effective catalytic activity. With the increase of the illumination time, the concentration of benzene rapidly decreases while the concentration of produced CO2 rapidly increases (Fig. 2A and B). After illumination for 40 min, benzene is completely oxidized to CO2. The initial rate of CO2 production (rCO2) in the initial five minutes is calculated. The rCO2 of Co3O4-MNR is very high (560 μmol g−1 min−1, Fig. 2C). To make comparisons, the photothermocatalytic activity of TiO2 (P25) as a well-known benchmark photocatalyst and a commercial Co3O4 sample (Aladdin, denoted as Co3O4-Aladdin) under UV-Vis-IR illumination and identical conditions was measured. Co3O4-Aladdin has a BET surface area of 11.4 m2 g−1, a pure spinel crystalline structure with an average crystal size of 111.7 nm (Fig. S4 and S5†), and fewer defects with a Co2+/Co3+ molar ratio of 1:1.92 close to 1:2 of a perfect Co3O4 crystal. The much higher concentration of Co2+ in the Co3O4-Aladdin sample than that in Co3O4-MNR was further confirmed by its very strong EPR signal of high-spin Co2+ in tetrahedral sites (Fig. S3†). Both TiO2 (P25) and Co3O4-Aladdin exhibit much lower photothermocatalytic activity than Co3O4-MNR (Fig. 2A–C). Compared to TiO2 (P25) and Co3O4-Aladdin, the rCO2 of Co3O4-MNR is massively enhanced by 309 and 165 times, respectively. As Co3O4-MNR has a higher surface area than Co3O4-Aladdin, in order to confirm if the massive catalytic enhancement of Co3O4-MNR originates from its higher surface area, their specific CO2 production rate per unit area (rSCO2) was compared. The rSCO2 values of Co3O4-MNR and Co3O4-Aladdin are 2.52 and 0.30 μmol m−2 min−1, respectively. Compared to Co3O4-Aladdin, the rSCO2 of Co3O4-MNR is enhanced by 8.4 times. This result unambiguously indicates that the presence of Co2+ vacancy defects in Co3O4 massively enhances its photothermocatalytic activity.

The catalytic durability of Co3O4-MNR for benzene oxidation under UV-Vis-IR illumination was evaluated. In this case, a feed stream of 1.9 g m−3 benzene and 20.8 vol% O2/N2 as the balance gas was continuously fed into the reactor at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. As shown in Fig. 2D, after illumination for 30 h, the catalytic activity of Co3O4-MNR remains unchanged. This result suggests that Co3O4-MNR exhibits very good durability. After the photothermocatalytic durability test, the used Co3O4-MNR sample was characterized by XRD, TEM, ICP--OES, chemical analysis, and EPR. The results of XRD and TEM show that both the pure spinel structure and the morphology of mesoporous nanorods consisting of closely contacted nanoparticles of the used Co3O4-MNR sample remain unchanged as compared to those of the fresh Co3O4-MNR sample (Fig. S6†). The results of ICP-OES, chemical analysis, and EPR show that the concentration of Co2+ vacancy defects of the used Co3O4-MNR samples almost remains unchanged. This is evidenced by the fact that the used Co3O4-MNR sample has a Co2+/Co3+ molar ratio of 1:3.07, very close to that of the fresh Co3O4-MNR sample (1:3.17), and has a very weak EPR signal like that of the fresh Co3O4-MNR sample (Fig. S3†).
The effect of light intensity on the photothermocatalytic activity of Co3O4-MNR for benzene oxidation under UV-Vis-IR illumination was investigated. At a light intensity of 347.4 mW cm−2, Co3O4-MNR exhibits photothermocatalytic activity with a rCO2 of 152.9 μmol g−1 min−1 (Fig. S7†). When the light intensity increases from 347.4 to 511.0 and 586.7 mW cm−2, the rCO2 of Co3O4-MNR significantly enhances from 152.9 to 560.0 and 741.3 μmol g−1 min−1, respectively.
The photothermocatalytic activity of the Co3O4-MNR sample for benzene oxidation under Vis-IR illumination was evaluated. Under λ > 420 nm Vis-IR illumination, Co3O4-MNR exhibits highly effective catalytic activity (Fig. 3A and B). After illumination for 40 min, benzene is completely oxidized. The rCO2 is as high as 539.0 μmol g−1 min−1. Under λ > 560 nm Vis-IR illumination, Co3O4-MNR exhibits good catalytic activity with a rCO2 of 159.1 μmol g−1 min−1. Even under λ > 690 nm Vis-IR illumination, Co3O4-MNR still exhibits catalytic activity with a rCO2 of 28.4 μmol min−1.

Mechanism: solar-light-driven thermocatalysis
To reveal why Co3O4-MNR exhibits highly effective photothermocatalytic activity, the optical absorption of the Co3O4-MNR and Co3O4-Aladdin samples is measured because it is a requisite for a solar-light-driven process. Both Co3O4-MNR and Co3O4-Aladdin exhibit strong absorption across the entire solar spectrum region (200–2400 nm) with similar absorption bands (Fig. 4A). The band around ∼345 nm is assigned to the ligand–metal charge transition of O2−–Co2+. The band around ∼650 nm is assigned to the metal–metal charge transition of Co3+–Co2+ (MMCT) and the absorption of low-spin Co3+ in octahedral sites. The strong broad band in the 1040–1780 nm region is assigned to the MMCT and absorption of Co2+ in tetrahedral sites.49 Compared to that for Co3O4-Aladdin, the broad band in the 1040–1780 nm region for Co3O4-MNR is obviously attenuated, suggesting that Co3O4-MNR has a lower amount of Co2+ than Co3O4-Aladdin. This result is consistent with the result of the lower Co2+/Co3+ molar ratio of Co3O4-MNR than Co3O4-Aladdin obtained by the above chemical analysis.

Equilibrium temperature of the samples under UV-Vis-IR and Vis-IR illumination (C). The thermocatalytic activity of the samples for benzene oxidation at different temperatures in the dark without illumination (D). 
It has been reported that Co3O4 has photocatalytic activity for the photodegradation of readily degradable dyes,16–18 which follows the well-known photocatalysis mechanism.1–3,5 To reveal if the strong absorption of Co3O4 leads to photocatalytic activity, the gas-phase oxidation of benzene on Co3O4-MNR at near ambient temperature under UV-Vis-IR illumination was evaluated. In striking contrast to the photocatalytic activity of Co3O4 reported,16–18 Co3O4-MNR has no photocatalytic activity for benzene oxidation, evidenced by no detectable CO2 produced on Co3O4-MNR (Fig. 4B). This is attributed to the fact that the photogenerated holes in the valance band of Co3O4 have a redox potential (2.44 vs. NHE) insufficient to oxidize hydroxyl groups (˙OH, H+/H2O = 2.73 V at pH = 7) and recalcitrant benzene with high redox potentials (2.995 vs. NHE).16,22,50 This result suggests that the very high photothermocatalytic activity of Co3O4-MNR under illumination (Fig. 2) mainly arises from solar-light-driven thermocatalytic oxidation51,52 as schematically illustrated in Scheme 1 instead of the well-known photocatalytic oxidation:1,2,5 the strong absorption of Co3O4-MNR causes an elevation in its surface temperature owing to photothermal conversion. When the temperature is elevated above the light-off temperature (Tlight-off) of the thermocatalytic oxidation of benzene, the thermocatalytic reaction proceeds. Remarkably, the solar-light-driven thermocatalysis on Co3O4-MNR makes the impossible photodegradation of recalcitrant pollutants possible.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of solar-light-driven thermocatalysis and photoactivation on Co3O4 with Co2+ vacancy defects. 
In order to verify the mechanism, we measured the surface temperatures of the Co3O4-MNR and Co3O4-Aladdin samples under illumination from a Xe lamp and conditions identical to those of the measurement of the photothermocatalytic activity as shown in Fig. 2 and 3. Upon the UV-Vis-IR illumination, the surface temperature of Co3O4-MNR is elevated to an equilibrium temperature (Teq) of 248 °C due to photothermal conversion (Fig. 4C). The Teq of Co3O4-Aladdin is 214 °C, less than that of Co3O4-MNR. This is due to the stronger optical absorption of Co3O4-MNR than Co3O4-Aladdin (Fig. 4A). We also measured the Teq values of the Co3O4-MNR sample under Vis-IR illumination. Under the Vis-IR illumination of λ > 420, 560, and 690 nm, the Teq value of Co3O4-MNR is 240, 220, and 189 °C, respectively (Fig. 4C). This result suggests that Co3O4-MNR can effectively convert the absorbed UV-Vis-IR and Vis-IR energy to thermal energy.
To affirm if the Teq values could exceed the Tlight-off value for the thermocatalytic oxidation of benzene on Co3O4-MNR, the thermocatalytic oxidation of benzene on Co3O4-MNR at different temperatures in the dark without illumination was performed. As shown in Fig. 4D, when the temperature is elevated to 120 °C, benzene starts to oxidiz (Tlight-off = ∼120 °C). When the temperature increases from 120 to 220 °C, the thermocatalytic activity of Co3O4-MNR rapidly increases. The reaction temperatures corresponding to 50% and 90% of benzene conversion (T50 and T90) are 205 and 220 °C, respectively. The low values of T50 and T90 indicate that Co3O4-MNR has very good thermocatalytic activity, even superior to a supported noble metal catalyst (commercial 0.5% Pt/Al2O3) that has been believed as one of the most efficient catalysts for VOC purification (Fig. 4D).34 All the Teq values of Co3O4-MNR exceed the Tlight-off value. Therefore, the solar-light-driven thermocatalytic oxidation of benzene on Co3O4-MNR proceeds.
As the benzene oxidation on Co3O4 follows the solar-light-driven thermocatalysis mechanism, the thermocatalytic activity of Co3O4 plays an important role in the photothermocatalytic benzene oxidation. To reveal why Co3O4-MNR has much higher photothermocatalytic activity than Co3O4-Aladdin (Fig. 2A–C), the thermocatalytic activity of Co3O4-Aladdin was measured under conditions identical to those of Co3O4-MNR (Fig. 4D). Co3O4-Aladdin exhibits much lower thermocatalytic activity than Co3O4-MNR. When the temperature is elevated to ∼200 °C, thermocatalytic benzene oxidation occurs (Tlight-off = 200 °C). The T50 and T90 values of Co3O4-Aladdin are 303 and 360 °C, respectively. Compared to those of Co3O4-Aladdin, the T50 and T90 values of Co3O4-MNR are massively reduced by 98 and 140 °C, respectively. As the Teq value of Co3O4-Aladdin under UV-Vis-IR illumination (214 °C) slightly exceeds its Tlight-off (∼200 °C), it exhibits very low photothermocatalytic activity (Fig. 2). The massively enhanced thermocatalytic activity of Co3O4-MNR as compared to that of Co3O4-Aladdin (Fig. 4D) together with its higher effective photothermal conversion (Fig. 4A and C) leads to its much higher photothermocatalytic activity (Fig. 2A–C).
Origin of the enhanced catalytic activity
Why does Co3O4-MNR exhibit a massively enhanced thermocatalytic activity as compared to Co3O4-Aladdin? It is commonly accepted that the catalytic oxidation of organic compounds on Co3O4 abides by the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism:27,29,31 organic compounds react with the surface lattice oxygen of Co3O4, and the produced oxygen vacancies are subsequently replenished by O2. To affirm the key role of the surface lattice oxygen of Co3O4, we performed an isotope labeling experiment in which 18O2 reacted with benzene (12C61H6) on the Co3O4-MNR sample, and the products were monitored by FTIR. When the illumination time increases to 10 min, the C–H stretching peaks of 12C61H6 at 3020–3120 cm−1 are attenuated, and four peaks at 2343, 2327, 2322, and 2309 cm−1 are observed (Fig. 5A). The strong double peaks at 2343 and 2322 cm−1 are assigned to the C–O stretching modes of 12C16O18O (Fig. S8†). The relatively weak double peaks at 2327 and 2309 cm−1 are assigned to the C–O stretching modes of 12C18O2 (Fig. S8†). The production of 12C16O18O indicates that 12C61H6 molecules are oxidized by the lattice oxygen of 16O in Co3O4-MNR. The replenishment of 16O vacancies by adsorbed 18O2 molecules makes 18O enter the surface lattice of Co3O4-MNR. Thus, both 18O and 16O co-exist on the surface lattice of Co3O4-MNR. The surface lattice oxygens of both 18O and 16O participate in benzene oxidation, resulting in the formation of 12C16O18O and 12C18O2 molecules. In the presence of 18O2 without 16O2, the peak intensity of 12C16O18O considerably higher than that of 12C18O2 reveals that 12C61H6 is mainly oxidized by the lattice oxygen of Co3O4-MNR rather than directly by adsorbed 18O2 molecules. With the increase of the illumination time, the double peaks of 12C16O18O and 12C18O2 are considerably intensified, accompanied by an obvious attenuation in the C–H stretching peaks of 12C61H6, finally disappearing after illumination for 70 min.

The calculated slabs of Co48O64 without a Co2+ vacancy (C) and Co47O64 with one Co2+ vacancy (D): the oxygen atom pointed to by an arrow represents the oxygen to be removed. 
After the 18O2 isotope experiment, the used Co3O4-MNR sample was heated in an atmosphere of 12C16O and N2 at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. When the temperature increases to 150 °C, strong double peaks of 12C16O18O at 2343 and 2322 cm−1 are observed (Fig. S9†). This observation suggests that a considerable amount of lattice 18O exists in the used Co3O4-MNR sample and participates in the oxidation of 12C16O. The results unambiguously reveal that the activity of the lattice oxygen or the reducibility of Co3O4 plays an important role in the catalytic oxidation as schematically illustrated in Scheme 1.
To reveal if the existence of Co2+ vacancy defects in Co3O4-MNR could affect the lattice oxygen activity or reducibility, thus affecting the thermocatalytic activity of Co3O4, the reducibility of the Co3O4-MNR and Co3O4-Aladdin samples was evaluated by CO-TPR. Co3O4-Aladdin has three strong peaks of CO consumption at 356, 374, and 387 °C (Fig. 5B). The strong peak at 356 °C is attributed to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO. The strong peaks at 374 and 387 °C are attributed to the reduction of CoO to metallic Co.26,30 In addition, there is a weak shoulder peak of CO consumption around 325 °C, which was attributed to the removal of surface lattice oxygen by CO as the surface lattice oxygen is more active than that in bulk, as confirmed by the DFT calculations (Fig. 5C, as discussed later). Co3O4-MNR has two peaks at 243 and 322 °C, and a broad strong peak around 424 °C. The peaks at 243 and 322 °C are attributed to the removal of two types of surface lattice oxygen. The broad strong peak around 424 °C indicates that the two steps of the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO and CoO to metallic Co overlap together. Compared to that of Co3O4-Aladdin, the peak corresponding to the removal of active surface lattice oxygen for Co3O4-MNR considerably shifts to a lower temperature. This result indicates that the presence of Co2+ vacancy defects in Co3O4-MNR considerably promotes the activity of the surface lattice oxygen of Co3O4, thus massively enhancing the thermocatalytic activity.
To further confirm the key role of the lattice oxygen activity or the reducibility of Co3O4 in the catalytic oxidation, O2-TPO of the Co3O4-MNR sample pre-reduced by CO at 250 °C was performed. The pre-reduced Co3O4-MNR sample has a strong O2 consumption peak at 143 °C (Fig. S10†), which is much lower than the reduction temperature of Co3O4-MNR by CO (243 °C) (Fig. 5B). This result demonstrates that the reduction of Co3O4-MNR is much more sluggish than the re-oxidation of the pre-reduced Co3O4-MNR sample (Co3O4−x).
To further affirm the experimental result, the effect of Co2+ vacancy defects on the activity of lattice oxygen in Co3O4 is investigated by DFT calculations. As both Co3O4-MNR and Co3O4-Aladdin have an exposed {111} surface (Fig. 1D and S4B†), a Co48O64 slab with a 3 × 3 {111} surface and the spinel structure of Co3O4 for the DFT calculations (Fig. 5C) was constructed. The space between neighboring {111} surfaces of the slabs is 1.0 nm. A Co47O64 slab with a Co2+ vacancy on its {111} surface was constructed by the removal of a Co2+ ion in the tetrahedral site from the Co48O64 slab (Fig. 5D). The energy for removing one oxygen atom from the surface of the two slabs (ΔE) by CO was calculated:ΔE = ESOV + ECO2 − ES −ECOwhere ESOV is the energy of the slab with one oxygen vacancy, ES is the energy of the slab, and ECO2 and ECO are the energies of CO2 and CO molecules in the gas phase, respectively.
The ΔE value for removing one oxygen atom (type-I) on the Co48O64 slab without a Co2+ vacancy is −2.67 eV (Fig. 5C). In striking contrast, the ΔE value for removing one oxygen atom (type-I) on the Co47O64 slab with one Co2+ vacancy decreases to −4.34 eV (Fig. 5D). Similarly, the ΔE value for removing one oxygen atom (type-II) on the Co48O64 slab without a Co2+ vacancy is −2.03 eV (Fig. 5C). The ΔE for removing one oxygen atom (type-II) on the Co47O64 slab with one Co2+ vacancy decreases to −4.37 eV (Fig. 5D). The DFT calculations indicate that the existence of a Co2+ vacancy on the surface of Co3O4 considerably promotes the activity of the surface lattice oxygen. In addition, the ΔE value for removing one oxygen atom in the bulk of the Co48O64 slab (0.30 eV) is much higher than that on the surface (Fig. 5C), suggesting that surface oxygens are more active than bulk oxygens.
Photoactivation
Whether does the highly effective photothermocatalytic activity of Co3O4-MNR (Fig. 2) only arise from the solar-light-driven thermocatalysis? If yes, at the same reaction temperature, the catalytic activity of Co3O4-MNR in the dark should be identical to that with illumination. To address this issue, the catalytic activity of the Co3O4-MNR sample for benzene oxidation in the dark or with UV-Vis-IR illumination under otherwise identical conditions was measured. As shown in Fig. 6A, at the same temperatures above 140 °C, the illumination leads to a considerable enhancement in the catalytic activity of Co3O4-MNR as compared to the corresponding activity in the dark. This result clearly demonstrates the existence of a novel photoactivation effect for benzene oxidation on Co3O4-MNR to considerably promote its solar-light-driven thermocatalytic activity.

CO-TPR profiles of Co3O4-MNR in the dark and with UV-Vis-IR illumination (B); the calculated slabs of Co47O64 with one Co2+ vacancy in the excited state (C): the oxygen atom pointed to by a white arrow represents the oxygen to be removed. 
As the lattice oxygen activity of Co3O4 plays a decisive role in its thermocatalytic activity as discussed above, we investigated the effect of illumination from a Xe lamp on the lattice oxygen activity of Co3O4-MNR to obtain an insight into the novel photoactivation. The CO-TPR of Co3O4-MNR in the dark and with UV-Vis-IR illumination under otherwise identical conditions was conducted. Upon the illumination, the CO consumption peak of Co3O4-MNR shifts to a lower temperature as compared to that in the dark (Fig. 6B). This result indicates that the illumination improves the activity of the lattice oxygen of Co3O4-MNR as schematically illustrated in Scheme 1.
To corroborate the photoactivation concluded by CO-TPR, we made a theoretical study under illumination on the activity of the lattice oxygen of Co3O4 by DFT calculations. The Vis-IR absorption of Co3O4 leads to the excitation of 3d electrons of Co ions,48 thus altering the number of electrons in up and down spin components for Co3O4. We calculated the ΔE for removing one lattice oxygen from the Co47O64 slab with one Co2+ vacancy in the excited state by CO (Fig. 6C) using a constrained occupancy approach of DFT by setting the excitation of one d electron to the excited state through altering the electron number of up and down spin components.51,53 In this case, the excitation of CO2 and CO molecules was not considered as they could not be excited by solar light illumination.Co47O64*(excited) + CO = CO2 + Co47O63*(excited)ΔE = ECo47O63* + ECO2 − ECo47O64* − ECO
The ΔE value for removing one lattice oxygen (type-I) from the Co47O64 slab in the excited state is −5.14 eV (Fig. 6C), less than that in the ground state (−4.34 eV, Fig. 5D). Similarly, the ΔE value for removing one lattice oxygen (type-II) from the Co47O64 slab in the excited state (−6.13 eV) is less than that in the ground state (−4.37 eV). The DFT calculations indicate that the illumination promotes the activity of the lattice oxygen of Co3O4, consistent with the result concluded by CO-TPR.
Conclusion
In summary, Co3O4 mesoporous nanorods with a considerable number of Co2+ vacancy defects were prepared by a facile method. Co3O4-MNR exhibits highly effective photothermocatalytic activity for benzene oxidation under UV-Vis-IR and Vis-IR illumination. It is found that the existence of Co2+ vacancy defects in Co3O4-MNR considerably enhances the lattice oxygen activity of Co3O4, thus massively promoting the photothermocatalytic activity. The highly effective photothermocatalytic oxidation on Co3O4-MNR follows a solar-light-driven thermocatalysis mechanism. A novel photoactivation is found to considerably enhance the solar-light-driven thermocatalytic activity of Co3O4: the UV-Vis-IR illumination enhances the activity of the lattice oxygen of Co3O4-MNR, thus considerably promoting the thermocatalytic activity. It should be noted that due to the toxicity of Co3O4, special attention should be paid during the utilization of the Co3O4 catalyst for the highly effective gas-phase purification of VOCs as air pollutants. The strategy is applicable to design highly effective nanostructured metal oxide catalysts that can utilize renewable solar energy for the environmental abatement of recalcitrant VOCs and chemical production with high efficiency and excellent durability.
