The structure modification significantly affected the photovoltaic performance with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 3.95% for PDFQx-2TB:ITIC, 4.82% for PDFQx-2T:ITIC, 4.93% for PDFQx-2T2F:ITIC and 8.13% for PDFQx-3T:ITIC. The dramatic increase in the PCE of PDFQx-3T:ITIC was attributed to improvements in the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). From the resonant soft X-ray scattering and grazing incidence X-ray scattering measurements, the PDFQx-3T polymers had well-developed, face-on oriented crystallites, allowing the formation of face-to-face alignment with the face-on ordered ITIC molecules at the interfaces. Also, the PDFQx-3T:ITIC blend films exhibited well intermixed blend morphology with smaller domain spacings. These combined features contributed to efficient charge generation with the highest exciton dissociation probability among the four different polymer:ITIC systems. In addition, dominant face-on orientation of both PDFQx-3T polymers and ITIC acceptors with a balanced crystalline coherence length ratio (CCLpolymer/CCLITIC) (0.87, based on the out-of-plane (010) diffraction peaks of PDFQx polymers and ITIC acceptors) led to a more balanced charge mobility than other blends, explaining the highest JSC and FF in the PDFQx-3T:ITIC NF devices.
Introduction
As a promising renewable energy technology, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention due to their advantages of mechanical flexibility, light weight, solution processability and roll-to-roll fabrication, etc.1–9 To date, a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 12% has been successfully demonstrated in fullerene-based OSCs.9,10 Recently, a main research stream in OSCs has turned its direction to nonfullerene (NF)-based organic solar cells (NF OSCs), because of the weak light absorption, difficulties in purification and electronic structure tunability, and poor morphological and thermal stabilities of fullerene acceptors.11–21 Recently various types of n-type NF polymers or small molecular acceptors have been reported, such as naphthalene-1,4:5,8-bis(dicarboximide) (NDI), perylenediimide (PDI), and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN) based conjugated semiconducting materials.22–31 In particular, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) derivatives have been extensively studied as promising n-type acceptors, showing 10–14% PCEs.18,32–34 However, these NF acceptors work efficiently with a very limited number of donor polymers.35–39 They are exclusively benzodithiophene (BDT)-based polymers including PTFB-O,36 J61,40 and FTAZ.41 Many other donor (D) and acceptor (A) pairs do not function efficiently, though they satisfy the essential requirements of frontier molecular orbital (FMO) alignment for exciton separation and complementary light absorption. Still no concrete guidelines for tailored D/A pairs have been established. Hence most of the recent research on developing high-performance NF OSCs has been performed in a trial-and-error manner.
Fullerene acceptors having a ball-like symmetric molecular geometry do not show a preferential orientation relative to the substrate and the D/A interface, because they allow isotropic electron transport in the 3D directions and efficient charge separation at D/A heterojunction interfaces.42,43 However, NF acceptors such as NDI-based polymers and ITIC derivatives present 2-dimensionally conjugated molecular structures with anisotropic charge transport properties depending on their packing orientations.44–48 Different interfacial orientations of the NF acceptors (i.e., face-on or edge-on orientations) may induce different degrees of π-orbital overlap, modulating the binding energy of excitons and the resulting charge separation.46,49,50 Therefore, these morphological features in BHJ blends closely correlate with the photovoltaic behaviors of NF OSCs, and careful investigation of the D/A molecular structure–blend morphology–device property relationship is strongly required to optimize the performance of NF OSCs.
Herein, we synthesized a series of difluoroquinoxaline-based copolymers with modulated polymer backbone structures. Starting from the poly(2,2′-bithiophene-alt-(2,3-bis(3,4-bis(octyloxy)phenyl)-6,7-difluoroquinoxaline)) (PDFQx-2T) copolymer,51 we have introduced fluorine atoms (PDFQx-2T2F) or inserted one more thiophene or benzene ring into the bithiophene segment (PDFQx-3T and PDFQx-2TB). This model system allows us to investigate how the structural modifications in the polymer backbone influence the BHJ film morphology and electrical properties in ITIC-based NF OSCs. The best device performance was observed for PDFQx-3T:ITIC, resulting from the substantial increases of both the short-circuit current density (JSC) and the fill factor (FF), which were attributed to enhanced charge generation and transport in the active layers. From grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) measurements, we observed a good correlation of the relative crystallite sizes of face-on oriented polymers and ITIC, hole/electron mobility balance and the resulting electrical properties. In particular, the PDFQx-3T:ITIC blend showed face-on dominant π–π stacking and balanced crystalline coherence lengths of the out-of-plane (010) scattering peaks (CCLpolymer/CCLITIC = 0.87), resulting in more balanced and high charge mobility in a vertical direction. Importantly, the PDFQX-3T:ITIC blend had the highest photovoltaic performance, which is mainly attributed to the formation of (1) interfacial face-to-face alignment with the face-on oriented PDFQx-3T and ITIC molecules and (2) the intermixed blend morphology with smaller domain spacings. These combined features in PDFQx-3T:ITIC resulted in the highest PCE of 8.13%. With regard to the NF D/A pairs which show poor performance regardless of the sufficient energetic offset for charge generation and well-intermixed blend morphology, the crystalline orientation of D and A molecules needs to be checked carefully at their interfaces and each D and A domain.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
A series of difluoroquinoxaline–thiophene-based alternating copolymers were designed and synthesized by modulating the polymeric backbone structures via introducing fluorine atoms or inserting additional spacers such as thiophene or phenylene units. Scheme 1 shows the chemical structures of the four donor polymers (named PDFQx-2T, PDFQx-2T2F, PDFQx-3T and PDFQx-2TB) and synthetic routes, as well as the molecular structure of ITIC. Briefly, the PDFQx polymers were prepared via the microwave-assisted Stille cross-coupling reaction of dibromoquinoxaline- and bistannylated thiphene-based monomers in 68–78% yield in toluene with Pd2(dba)3 as a catalyst. All the polymers showed sufficient solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene, etc. The number average molecular weight (Mn = 36–87 kDa) and polydispersity index (PDI = 3.5–4.9) of the polymers were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 80 °C using o-dichlorobenzene as the eluent relative to polystyrene as a standard. Thermal properties were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The onset decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of PDFQx-2T, PDFQx-2T2F, PDFQx-3T and PDFQx-2TB was determined to be 412, 403, 401 and 407 °C, respectively, suggesting high thermal stability of all polymers. No discernible thermal transitions were observed from DSC measurements in a temperature range of 35–350 °C.

Structural analysis using DFT calculations
Theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT, Jaguar quantum chemistry software, B3LYP/6-31G** level) were employed to analyze the optimized molecular geometries and the FMO structures of the four polymers (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†). For calculation simplicity, methyl substituents (in place of dioctyl groups) were considered for all structures. For polymer PDFQx-2T, the dihedral angles along the polymeric backbone are found to be 10–18° in the energy-minimized structure. After introducing two F atoms in bithiophene, the dihedral angles are reduced to 1–11° and the polymer PDFQx-2T2F shows enhanced backbone planarity, which is enabled by intramolecular noncovalent dipole–dipole interactions such as Sδ+⋯Fδ− and Fδ−⋯Hδ+.51–53 For polymer PDFQx-3T with one more thiophene inserted into the bithiophene segment, similar dihedral angles (3–20°) are observed to those of PDFQx-2T. In the case of PDFQx-2TB, a more twisted backbone (relative to that of PDFQx-2T) is calculated with addition of a phenylene moiety between two thiophenes, which is attributed to the increased steric hindrance between the neighboring H atoms of thiophene and phenylene rings. Therefore, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PDFQx-2T2F and PDFQx-2TB are down-shifted relative to the other two polymers, because of the strong electron-withdrawing effect of F substituents (for PDFQx-2T2F) and the increased bandgap from the reduced conjugation of the twisted backbone (PDFQx-2TB).
Optical and electrochemical properties
Optical properties of the four polymer donors and ITIC acceptor in solution and in thin film were characterized by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 1a and b). In chloroform solution, PDFQx-3T and PDFQx-2T2F show a clear vibronic shoulder peak at 659 and 675 nm, respectively, suggesting strong self-aggregation even in solution. Among the four polymers, PDFQx-2TB shows the least structured and blue-shifted absorption, indicative of negligible aggregation in solution due to the twisted backbone (Fig. S2, ESI†). Substantially red-shifted absorption spectra of all the polymers in the thin films were observed compared to those in solution (Table 1). The absorption coefficients in film were measured and a slight increment was observed from 4.2 × 104 cm−1 for PDFQx-2TB to 5.3–6.3 × 104 cm−1 for the other three polymers, which may be also related to different molecular planarity and the resulting packing structures in film.54 The electrochemical properties of the four polymers and ITIC acceptor were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The HOMO energy levels of PDFQx-2T, PDFQx-2T2F, PDFQx-3T and PDFQx-2TB were determined to be −5.42, −5.58, −5.40, and −5.56 eV (Table 1) from the onset of the oxidation potential. The incorporation of F atoms and the phenylene moiety decreased substantially the HOMO energy levels of PDFQx-2T2F and PDFQx-2TB, which is well consistent with DFT calculation results (Fig. S3, ESI†).55 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were estimated from the HOMO levels and optical band gap in film: −3.73 eV for PDFQx-2T, −3.88 eV for PDFQx-2T2F, −3.67 eV for PDFQx-3T and −3.65 eV for PDFQx-2TB, respectively. Additionally, the FMO energy levels of ITIC were measured to be −3.94 eV for the LUMO and −5.61 eV for the HOMO, respectively, by CV (Fig. S4, ESI†). The HOMO–HOMO offset may not be enough to generate efficient exciton dissociation via hole transfer at the D/A interfaces for PDFQx-2T2F and PDFQx-2TB (Fig. 1c). The exciton separation depending on the polymer structure was studied in detail by photoluminescence (PL) quenching and photocurrent measurements, which will be discussed in the following section.

Photovoltaic properties
NF OSC devices were fabricated with a conventional type device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDFQx:ITIC/LiF/Al. The devices were optimized by varying the solvents, blend ratio, processing additive and post treatment conditions. The optimized PDFQx:ITIC blended OSCs were prepared using chlorobenzene as a solvent with 0.5 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). The optimized D:A ratio was 1.3:1 (w/w) for PDFQx-2T:ITIC, 1:1.5 for PDFQx-2T2F, 1:1 for PDFQx-3T, and 1.3:1 for PDFQx-2TB. The optimal concentration of (D + A) was 16 mg mL−1 for all blends. Fig. 2a and b display the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of OSCs. Summarized photovoltaic properties including the open-circuit voltage (VOC), JSC and fill factor (FF) are provided in Table 2. As expected in the CV measurements, the lower HOMO levels of PDFQx-2T2F and PDFQx-2TB increased the VOC to 0.97 V and 0.93 V relative to 0.86 V of PDFQx-2T:ITIC and 0.82 V of PDFQx-3T:ITIC. The PDFQx-3T:ITIC blend showed the highest JSC (15.67 mA cm−2) and FF (0.56) among the four polymer:ITIC systems. Compared with those of PDFQx-3T:ITIC, PDFQx-2T:ITIC and PDFQx-2T2F:ITIC showed relatively lower JSC (12.23 and 10.34 mA cm−2) and FF (0.42 and 0.47) values. The PDFQx-2TB:ITIC blend showed the lowest JSC (9.03 mA cm−2). As a result, the maximum PCE values for PDFQx-2T:ITIC, PDFQx-2T2F:ITIC, PDFQx-3T:ITIC, and PDFQx-2TB:ITIC were 4.82, 4.93, 7.54 and 3.95%, respectively. Furthermore, the PCE of PDFQx-3T:ITIC was further improved up to 8.13% with a JSC of 17.11 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.58 by thermal annealing at 90 °C for 20 min, which is attributed to the enhanced intermolecular ordering of photoactive materials. As shown in Fig. 2b, the EQE spectra exhibited the same trend as the JSC values and the PDFQx-3T:ITIC blend had the highest EQE values over the whole measured wavelength range.

Morphological properties
The intermolecular orientation and packing structures of pristine PDFQx polymers and PDFQx:ITIC blend films were investigated by GIXS measurements. First, we prepared pristine PDFQx polymer thin films on the Si/PEDOT:PSS substrate by spin-coating from chlorobenzene solution. As shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S5 (ESI†), PDFQx-2T and PDFQx-2T2F present well-resolved lamellar peaks up to (400) in both out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) directions, which indicates the presence of highly-ordered crystallites with bimodal (edge-on and face-on) orientation. The lamellar scattering peaks of PDFQx-2T2F along the OOP direction were more prominent compared to PDFQx-2T. It is probably related to the improved backbone planarity of PDFQx-2T2F by fluorination, as calculated by DFT (Fig. S2, ESI†). Interestingly, the PDFQx-3T film had the high-order lamellar scattering peaks only in the IP direction together with strong OOP (010) scattering, suggesting a dominant face-on orientation of the PDFQx3T polymer in thin film. In the case of PDFQx-2TB, much weaker lamellar scattering was measured in the OOP direction, suggesting that PDFQx-2TB had a more amorphous nature mainly due to its twisted backbone that resulted in reduced intermolecular interaction. These GIXS results demonstrate that the molecular orientation of PDFQx series polymers is strongly affected by the incorporated unit on the polymer backbone. It is noteworthy to mention that PDFQx-3T having preferentially face-on oriented crystallites is beneficial for efficient charge transport in a vertical direction, compared to PDFQx-2T, PDFQx-2T2F and PDFQx-2TB possessing significant fractions of edge-on crystallites.56–59
 Fig. 3  2D-GIXS images of (a) PDFQx pristine films and (b) PDFQx:ITIC blend films. 
Next, the polymer packing structures of the four PDFQx polymer:ITIC blend films were investigated by GIXS (Fig. 3b, Fig. S5, ESI,† and Table 3). The blend films were prepared under the same conditions for optimal device fabrication. We found that the intrinsic molecular orientations of PDFQx polymers in pristine film were well preserved in the blend films. PDFQx-2T and PDFQx-2T2F blends showed high-order lamellar peaks up to (400) along the OOP direction. This is indicative of the presence of the edge-on oriented PDFQx-2T and PDFQx-2T2F crystallites in the blend films. Since ITIC acceptors predominantly form face-on packing in thin films, the edge-on fractions of polymer donors may lead to inefficient exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interfaces.44,46,47,49 Contrary to the 3-dimensional fullerene-based D:A blends, the different interfacial orientation in the nonfullerene BHJ blends induces a different degree of π-orbital overlap, exciton dissociation and resulting charge generation properties.

As discussed above, since the face-on orientation of both donor and acceptor molecules in the active layer films is closely linked to device performance in NF OSCs, we analyzed the OOP (010) peaks carefully. Based on the GIXS results of the pristine films, we first assigned the (010) peaks from the PDFQx polymers and ITIC domains in the blend film and then deconvoluted the peaks by Gaussian fitting using a multi-peak fitting tool in OriginPro9 (Fig. 4). For quantitative morphological analysis, the π–π stacking distances and the crystalline coherence lengths (CCLs) of the OOP (010) scattering were extracted, and those are summarized in Table 3.45,60–62 By using the Scherrer equation,63,64 we found that PDFQx polymers have similar CCL values of 25.1–26.9 Å except PDFQx-2T (32.6 Å). Interestingly, the crystalline feature of ITIC in the active layer was significantly influenced by the different PDFQx polymers.37 The CCL (30.9 Å) value of ITIC in the PDFQx-3T blend was the smallest, which was followed by 36.8 Å (PDFQx-2T2F blend) < 41.6 Å (PDFQx-2TB blend) < 43.5 Å (PDFQx-2T blend). The different crystallinity of PDFQx polymers and miscibility with ITIC may be the main reason for the difference in the CCL values. Additionally, we evaluated the ratios of CCL values of PDFQx polymers and ITIC (CCLpolymer/CCLITIC). The ratios were calculated to be 0.87, 0.75, 0.70, and 0.60 for PDFQx-3T:ITIC, PDFQx-2T:ITIC, PDFQx-2T2F:ITIC and PDFQx-2TB:ITIC, respectively (Table 3). Interestingly, we noted that the CCLpolymer/CCLITIC values showed a good correlation with the JSC values of the devices (see Tables 2 and 3). The CCL ratio of PDFQx-3T:ITIC had a value close to 1, suggesting similar crystalline properties of the polymer donor and ITIC in a face-on fashion in the blends, which may be beneficial for promoting balanced hole and electron mobility.

Next, we performed resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) experiments to investigate the average domain size.65–69 A resonant energy of 284.6 eV was used to enhance the scattering contrast between donor and acceptor domains. As shown in Fig. 5a, PDFQx-2T:ITIC, PDFQx-2T2F:ITIC, and PDFQx-3T:ITIC films display a distinct peak at 0.0104, 0.0105, and 0.0139 Å−1, respectively. Assuming that the volume fractions of donor and acceptor phases are the same in blends, domain sizes could be estimated as half of the domain spacing (d = 2π/q).49 The resultant domain sizes were 30.3, 30.0, and 22.6 nm for PDFQx-2T:ITIC, PDFQx-2T2F:ITIC, and PDFQx-3T:ITIC, respectively. In contrast, PDFQx-2TB:ITIC displays broad and weak scattering at q = 0.0084 Å−1 and a strong scattering peak at a lower q value smaller than 0.0036 Å−1, indicating that the PDFQx-2TB:ITIC blend film has a domain with an average size of 37.6 nm partially, together with a much larger domain size over 300 nm. The reduced crystallite sizes with balanced CCLpolymer/CCLITIC in PDFQx-3T:ITIC could increase the miscibility between D and A, resulting in the smallest domain size (22.6 nm). Also, the lowest scattering intensity (the lowest domain purity) observed for the PDFQx-3T:ITIC blend corroborated the well-intermixed blend morphology. This feature should contribute to efficient charge generation via large D/A interfaces, thus promoting the highest JSC value in the PDFQx3T-based NF OSCs.70–72

Polymer packing structures and BHJ morphologies of polymer blends closely correlate with the electrical properties of OSC devices. Thus, we further investigated the charge transport and exciton dissociation characteristics. The hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities were first measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†).73,74 The PDFQx:ITIC blend films were spin-coated at the optimal device fabrication condition with 3 different thickness (∼100, ∼70, and ∼50 nm) to obtain accurate mobility values. As shown in Table 4, PDFQx-3T blends with ITIC had the highest μh value of 1.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas the PDFQx-2TB:ITIC blend had the lowest hole mobility of 6.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The electron mobilities of the PDFQx:ITIC blend showed a similar trend to hole mobilities, showing that the PDFQx-3T:ITIC blend had the highest μe = 9.8 × 10−5. We also calculated the hole/electron mobility ratio, where PDFQx-3T:ITIC exhibited the most well balanced hole and electron mobilities with a mobility ratio of μh/μe = 1.8.

In order to gain a deeper understanding of charge generation characteristics, the PL quenching and exciton dissociation probability (P(E,T)) of the blend films were also investigated. To investigate the exciton separation (via hole transfer) for the four blend systems, we measured the PL quenching for the four blend films by exciting the acceptor at 720 nm. The PL quenching efficiency was measured to be approximately 58, 31, 74, and 40% for PDFQx-2T:ITIC, PDFQx-2T2F:ITIC, PDFQx-3T:ITIC and PDFQx-2TB:ITIC, respectively (Fig. 6). Although the different blend morphologies of the four polymer:ITIC blends need to be considered carefully, the relatively lower quenching efficiency for PDFQx-2T2F:ITIC and PDFQx-2TB:ITIC could mainly originate from the insufficient energy offset (HOMO–HOMO offset) for hole transfer from the acceptor to the donor (Fig. 1c). Next, the photocurrent density (Jph) was calculated from the difference between the current density under illumination (at 100 mW cm−2) and in the dark, and the effective voltage (Veff) is the differential voltage between the voltage at Jph = 0 (V0) and the applied voltage (Va) (Veff = V0 − Va). Jph shows a saturation at a certain value (Jsat) depending on the polymer:ITIC blend with increasing Veff.66 The Jsat values were determined to be 12.72, 14.15, 16.46, and 18.58 mA cm−2 for PDFQx-2TB:ITIC, PDFQx-2T2F:ITIC, PDFQx-2T:ITIC and PDFQx-3T:ITIC, respectively. Based on the Jphversus Veff characteristics, the values of P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat were determined to be 57.8, 64.9, 76.3 and 78.1% for PDFQx-2TB:ITIC, PDFQx-2T2F:ITIC, PDFQx-2T:ITIC and PDFQx-3T:ITIC, respectively, at the short-circuit condition (Fig. S8, ESI†). Based on the above analyses, the relation of molecular structure, and morphological and electrical characteristics is plotted in Fig. 5b.

According to the PL quenching and Jph measurements, the poor PCEs of PDFQx-2TB:ITIC and PDFQx-2T2F:ITIC might be caused by the insufficient HOMO–HOMO offset in part. However, we observed that PDFQx-2T:ITIC, which has a sufficient energy offset for exciton separation, also showed a poor PCE (ave. 4.38%), which is comparable to the PCEs (ave. 4.74% and 3.78%) of the PDFQx-2T2F:ITIC and PDFQx-2TB:ITIC blends. This suggests that there must be other important factors to influence the photovoltaic performance of the polymer:ITIC blends. As we discussed above, many NF D and A pairs do not function effectively, though they satisfy the essential requirements of FMO levels for exciton separation and complementary light absorption. As discussed before, one main reason for the poor performance in these NF OPV devices can be related to the relative molecular orientation of both D and A in the BHJ blends. In particular, for the PDFQX-3T and ITIC blend, both the molecules are oriented in a face-on manner with face-to-face alignment at the interfaces to yield efficient charge generation and transport in a vertical direction. In addition, the balanced crystalline properties with the CCL ratio close to 1 in the face-on orientation induced the high and balanced μh and μe values. As the CCL ratio of the OOP (010) peaks can be a good parameter to quantify the relative crystallinity of face-on oriented D and A in the D/A BHJ blends, this value can be a useful parameter to probe the charge generation/transport in a vertical direction.
Conclusions
In summary, a series of difluoroquinoxaline–thiophene based copolymers with modification of the polymeric backbone were synthesized and their molecular structure–blend morphology–photovoltaic property relationships were investigated by fabricating NF solar cells with ITIC as an acceptor. Among the four different blend systems, PDFQx-3T:ITIC exhibited the best PCE of 8.13% with a highest JSC of 17.1 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.58, outperforming other devices. Through X-ray technique assisted morphology analysis, both PDFQx-3T and ITIC adopt strong face-on orientation with balanced crystallite sizes, leading to high and well-balanced vertical charge mobility. Moreover, the relatively well-intermixed morphology of PDFQx-3T:ITIC was more beneficial for promoting charge generation as evidenced by high P(E,T) and PL quenching. We speculate that in addition to consideration of a variety of morphological parameters including molecular orientation, domain size and purity, the relative crystal sizes of the face-on oriented donor and acceptor could be another parameter to influence the charge transport and photovoltaic performance of NF solar cells.
