    , Accepted 22nd February 2019First published on 22nd February 2019AbstractEnvironmental concerns and the high cost of some key components are the main obstacles to the practical applications of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a novel, eco-friendly and lost-cost MnS film was developed and employed as an efficient inorganic hole transport layer (HTL) of PSCs for the first time via the technique of vacuum vapor deposition. Benefiting from its good optical transparency, high hole mobility and suitable band alignment, an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.86% was achieved in the optimized device with an inorganic HTL of manganese sulfide (MnS) without any further interface optimization. More importantly, the MnS-based devices demonstrated superior stability over their counterparts with organic HTLs; they retained over 90% of their initial efficiency even after exposure to air with a relative humidity of 80% for 1000 h without any encapsulation. It also remarkably improved the thermal stability of the devices than their organic counterparts. These results highlight the great potential of the MnS HTL for achieving eco-friendly, cost-effective and stable photovoltaic devices.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have captured widespread attention due to their large absorption coefficient,1–4 high carrier mobility,5 long carrier lifetime,6–8 and direct bandgap.9,10 Significant progress has been made over the last few years, and a certified record in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) (23.70%) has been recently achieved,11–20 which is comparable to those of some thin-film solar cells such as CdTe (22.10%) and CIGS (22.30%).21 Even so, it is not a smooth way for the commercial applications of PSCs until obstacles such as environmental safety and the high cost of some key materials have been removed.
In a typical PSC architecture, the hole transport layer (HTL) plays the role of transferring photogenerated holes from the perovskite to the counter electrode, and it is as important as the electron transport layer (ETL) for the device performance and stability.22–30 Currently, conductive organic materials such as Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene) and PTAA (poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine]) are the most frequently used HTL materials for PSCs.31 Although high PCEs have been reported in some PSCs with organic HTLs,32–38 the disadvantages of these HTLs are also very obvious and not negligible. For instance, the first disadvantage is the low hole mobility (about 10−5 to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1),39 and it can be somewhat increased by the addition of some lithium or cobalt salts; however, these hydrophilic additives in Spiro-OMeTAD or PTAA are detrimental to the device performance and stability of PSCs due to the high sensitivity of the perovskite materials to moisture.40–42 Second, conventional Spiro-OMeTAD HTL needs to be oxidized in ambient conditions, and some pinholes inevitably result, which are also adverse to the device performance.42 Moreover, the expensive purification procedure and hazardous benzene-based solvents of organic HTL materials are the biggest challenges to the commercial application of PSCs.
In comparison with the widely used organic HTLs, inorganic p-type semiconductor materials have attracted increasing attention due to superior hole mobility and outstanding stability. For instance, CuI thin films have been fabricated by a facile spray deposition method and employed as HTLs for PSCs by Yang et al.15 In late 2017, Arora et al. reported CuSCN-based PSCs with stabilized PCEs of over 20%.43 However, their operational stability was poor, which might be attributed to the potential-induced degradation of CuSCN/Au. Therefore, a conductive reduced graphene oxide layer was employed at the interface between CuSCN and Au to achieve high PCE and long-term stability. Unfortunately, no solvent except toxic propylsulfide has been found to be suitable for them to form a compact layer on perovskite. Moreover, it is detrimental to the perovskite layer, thus leading to low stability and PCE over long time. Bonaccorso et al. and Ko et al. employed MoS2 and FeS2, respectively, as the HTLs of PSCs, and the PCEs of PSCs with MoS2 and FeS2 HTLs were 13.3% and 12.6%, respectively, which were still much lower than those of the PSCs with organic HTLs.41,44 Furthermore, the fabrication processes for MoS2 and FeS2 materials are very complicated and some toxic agents, such as diphenyl ether and N-methyl pyrrolidone, are also involved during the process of chemical synthesis. More recently, Chen et al. reported a high PCE over 18% in the PSCs with an inorganic HTL of CuGaO2.45 However, this work is somewhat devalued due to the very rare and expensive metal component of Ga in the compound. Most PSCs with inorganic HTLs manifest relatively inferior performance to that of their counterparts with organic HTLs. The main reason is that very few inorganic HTLs can exhibit the advantages of high electrical properties, good thermal stability, and a well-matched work function at the same time. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore and develop an eco-friendly and cost-effective inorganic hole transport material for high-performance and stable perovskite solar cells.
Herein, we developed a novel MnS inorganic HTL for PSCs via the technique of vacuum vapor deposition for the first time. Approximately, for commercialized drugs, the cost of inorganic MnS material (4$ per g) is only about 1/125 times that of Spiro-OMeTAD powder (500$ per g).46 In addition, the solvent-free fabrication process is not only eco-friendly but also more facile and chemically more compatible with the perovskite layer. As a result, an excellent PCE of 19.86% was achieved in the MnS-based PSCs without any interfacial modification to the perovskite absorber. Moreover, the device showed much improved stability under harsh conditions (85 °C, 80% humidity, 1sun) retaining 80% of the initial efficiency after 400 h without any encapsulation.
Experimental
Chemicals and materials
Unless specified, all chemicals were purchased from Alfa Aesar or Sigma-Aldrich. Formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium bromine (MABr), lead iodide (PbI2) and lead bromine (PbBr2) were purchased from Ying Kou You Xuan Trade Co., Ltd. Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp.
Preparation of the mixed perovskite precursor
Referring to the relevant literature,17 the FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 mixed perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 1.4 M mixture of metal lead salts composed of 0.85 PbI2 and 0.15 PbBr2 and 1.3 M organic cations composed of 0.85 FAI and 0.15 MABr in anhydrous DMF:DMSO (4:1, volume ratio).
Device fabrication
The etched FTO glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min each. The glasses were then dried and treated by plasma for 5 min prior to use. An approximately 30 nm-thick TiO2 compact layer was sprayed on the hot FTO substrate using a 0.2 M titanium diisopropoxide-bis(acetylacetonate) solution and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. Afterward, according to our previous work,15 a mesoporous Na-treated TiO2 film was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 50 s and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. The perovskite layer was deposited via an anti-solvent method. Here, a 50 μL perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 5 s and then at 4000 rpm for 60 s. During the second step, 120 μL of chlorobenzene was dropped at the last 5th second. The substrates were then annealed at 120 °C for 45 min. After cooling, the alternative hole transport layer (HTL) was deposited. According to a previous work,5 a Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg Spiro-OMeTAD powder in 1 ml chlorobenzene, to which 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 μL LiN(CF3SO2)2 (LITSFI) solutions (520 mg LiTSFI in 1 ml acetonitrile) were added. Thus, the 4-tert-butylpyridine and LiN(CF3SO2)2 (LITSFI) additives were added to the Spiro-OMeTAD solution. Then, the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared according to a previous report and was deposited on the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The inorganic MnS HTL was prepared on top of the perovskite layer via thermal evaporation of MnS powder (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) in vacuum of ∼1 × 10−4 torr using a thermal evaporator (Beijing Technol Science Co., Ltd). The evaporation rate was 0.9 Å s−1 and the Z-factor of MnS was 0.94. Finally, 80 nm gold was evaporated as the back electrode to form the entire device.
Characterizations
The crystal structures of MnS and perovskite films were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD-7000s, Shimadzu). The absorption and transmittance spectra of the films were measured by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, PerkinElmer). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were performed using the XPS/UPS system (AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600 W, Shimadzu). The surface morphology and RMS roughness of perovskite and MnS thin films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM, SPM9700, Shimadzu). The chemical composition and distribution of the constituents were observed by an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA, EPMA-8050G, Shimadzu). The surface morphologies and microstructures of the perovskite and MnS films and the cross-sectional structure of perovskite solar cells were investigated by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, GeminiSEM300, Carl Zeiss) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). Fast component analysis of the MnS film was measured using an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA-8050G, Shimadzu). The Ecopia HMS 5500 Hall system was applied to measure the room-temperature mobility and conductivity using the van der Pauw method with a magnetic field strength of 0.550 T. The photo-current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under one-sun AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination with a solar light simulator (Model 71675-71580, Oriel Company). Photoluminescence (PL, excitation at 325 nm) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL, excitation at 325 nm and emission at 760 m) spectra were obtained using a laser spectrometer (FLS 980, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured using a Newport-74125 system (Newport Instrument). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, IviumStat 10800, Ivium Technologies) was performed under dark conditions and the frequency range was from 1 MHz to 100 MHz.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of the as-deposited film on the quartz glass. The main diffraction peaks assigned to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), and (420) peaks at 29.62°, 34.34°, 49.35°, 58.62°, 61.50°, 72.37°, and 82.61°, respectively, are well-indexed as the MnS compound with a rock salt structure (JCPDS card no. 01-088-2223), as depicted in Fig. 1b. The SEM image of the as-deposited MnS film (Fig. 1c), which is quite different from that of FTO shown in Fig. 1d, demonstrates that the MnS nanoparticles are distributed uniformly and densely on the FTO substrate.

Moreover, the roughness of the MnS film deposited on FTO is much lower than that of the pristine FTO substrate, indicating a smoother and more compact surface (Fig. S1†). The EDS mappings of the Mn and S elements (Fig. S2†) and the XPS spectra (Fig. S3†) further confirm that the vapor-deposited film has homogeneous composition with an atomic ratio of 1:1 approximately.
In Fig. 2a and b, it can be clearly observed that a compact, smooth, and pinhole-free perovskite film has been formed with an average grain size of 350 nm; the vapor-deposited MnS film can densely cover the perovskite layer and the average perovskite grain size remains approximately the same, which is vital for achieving high-performance solar cells. The technique of vacuum vapor deposition was employed because it can avoid the degradation of the organic–inorganic perovskite layer caused by the spin-coating of the solution.47 The XRD pattern shown in Fig. S4† confirms its perovskite structure; the EPMA analysis (Fig. S5†) of the MnS-covered perovskite layer also reveals the existence of Pb, I, Mn and S components and confirms their uniform distribution. As shown in Fig. 2c, d and S6,† the roughness of the MnS-covered perovskite (17.11 nm) is higher than that of the Spiro-OMeTAD (abbreviated as Spiro)-deposited perovskite (4.65 nm). Generally, a rougher surface may not be conducive for a good contact of the Au electrode.

However, the reason for this difference is mainly due to the film formation methods. Vacuum deposition usually results in the replication of the underlying morphology, while spin-coating has an additional planarization effect. Thus, MnS prepared by vacuum deposition without any solvent can get a compact layer and have good contact with the perovskite film. However, the Spiro-OMeTAD layer prepared by the solution method may result in point defects or paths for electrical shortage. The Spiro-OMeTAD film also has some solvents in it, leading to relatively poor conductivity. As is known, the Au film was also prepared by vacuum deposition, and it would also have a good contact with MnS HTL because vacuum deposition usually results in the replication of the underlying morphology, as discussed before.
To elucidate the efficacy of MnS as an HTL, PSCs with an architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/MAPbI3/MnS HTL/Au were assembled according to the model in Fig. 3a. As seen in Fig. 3b and c, the MnS film shows high transmittance and the calculated optical bandgap of MnS is 3.65 eV, which is consistent with the previous results.48,49 Please note that the MnS thin film manifested very low absorption in the visible-light wavelength range and the spin-coating of Spiro or vacuum deposition of the MnS film did not affect the absorption of the incident light by the perovskite film, as shown in Fig. S7.† As displayed in Fig. 3d and e, the valence band maximum (VBM) of MnS can be confirmed by UPS spectra. It is observed that MnS has a fairly well-matched energy level with the perovskite layer, resulting in better device performance, as seen from the energy level diagram depicted in Fig. 3f, which will be discussed below. As presented in Fig. S8a,† the dependence of the champion device performance on the thickness of the MnS film was first investigated to identify the optimal thickness for PSCs, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1.† It was found that the PSC based on a thin MnS film (for example, 50 nm or 75 nm) exhibited inferior performance with a relatively low open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), which can be attributed to the low shunt resistance. For efficient hole transporting and electron blocking, the device based on a thicker MnS layer (100 nm) showed significantly improved Voc and short-circuit current (Jsc). However, such improvement was not observed as the thickness increased to 150 nm due to the relatively high series resistance. Therefore, the optimal thickness for the MnS layer was suggested to be around 100 nm in this work, as confirmed by a typical cross-sectional SEM image of an optimized device in Fig. S9.†

Meanwhile, Fig. S8b† shows the measured IPCE spectra of the cells with different MnS films. The integrated current densities from these curves are 20.65, 20.74, 21.87 and 21.70 mA cm−2 for the devices based on MnS HTLs for 50, 75, 100 and 150 nm thicknesses, respectively, which are in good agreement with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves. To further investigate the charge transportation and recombination behavior of photogenerated carriers,22 the PL spectra of the devices based on MnS HTLs were measured (Fig. S8c†). Obviously, the 100 nm MnS-based sample exhibited the weakest PL intensity, indicating minimum recombination of carriers and thus the best device performance. These PL spectra also confirmed the results of the J–V curves, as shown in Fig. S8a.† Moreover, the histograms of the MnS-based devices with different thicknesses are illustrated in Fig. S8d.† This result is further ascertained by the statistical PCE as a function of thickness, as shown in Fig. S10;† it exhibits a good reproducibility with relatively low SD, where the MnS layer with the optimum thickness of 100 nm delivers superior performance with the highest average PCE of 18.33 ± 0.21%, including a maximum PCE of 18.68%. This implies that the MnS film with proper thickness works well as an HTL.
As a contrast experiment, the J–V curves of the best devices based on Spiro HTL and MnS HTL with respect to scan direction are presented in Fig. 4a. Apparently, the performance of the device based on MnS HTL is superior to that of the Spiro-based one, which is also confirmed by the statistical deviation of the photovoltaic parameters of the PSC devices based on Spiro or MnS HTL, as shown in Fig. 4b; the detailed average parameters are shown in Table S3.†

(c) IPCE spectra of different HTL-based PSCs. (d) Steady-state PCEs of PSCs using Spiro and MnS HTLs measured at constant bias voltages of 0.85 and 0.90 V, respectively. 
As can be seen from the best device parameters in Table S2,† the PSC based on Spiro HTL yielded PCE of 17.12%, with Voc of 1.04 V, Jsc of 22.24 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.74 under standard AM1.5 solar illumination. For a fair comparison, a control cell device using MnS HTL achieved PCE of 18.68%, with Voc of 1.09 V, Jsc of 22.56 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.76, revealing that higher Jsc, higher FF, and the particularly higher Voc contributed to the enhanced PCE. Moreover, it also showed negligible hysteresis in the J–V curves; the J–V curves of the device based on the MnS HTL under different step delay times and voltage step sizes are also given for comparison in Fig. S11a and b.† It can be seen that the J–V curves of the device based on MnS are almost the same and independent of the scan rate, reflecting the lower hysteresis effect in the PSC based on MnS; this is mainly attributed to the reduced recombination and fast charge transfer at the perovskite/HTL interface, which will be discussed later.50
In addition, to evaluate the photo-current enhancement, the IPCE spectra of both devices are presented in Fig. 4c. The integrated current densities calculated from the IPCE curves are 21.26 and 21.87 mA cm−2 for the devices based on Spiro and MnS HTLs, respectively, which are in good accordance with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves and within the margin of error. To verify the reliability of the fabricated PSCs, the stabilized photo-currents measured at constant biases of 0.85 and 0.90 V near the maximum output power point for the Spiro HTL- and MnS HTL-based devices are shown in Fig. 4d, revealing steady-state PCEs of 16.24% and 18.21%, respectively.
To prove that charge transfer occurred at the perovskite/HTL interface, the steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra were obtained accordingly.5,15,22 As shown in Fig. S12a,† the MnS-based perovskite film presents more efficient PL quenching than the Spiro-based perovskite film, indicating better hole-transfer efficiency from the perovskite to MnS HTL. In addition, the carrier lifetime originating from the time-resolved PL decay also significantly shortened, as shown in Fig. S12b.† All parameters are listed in Table S4.† Obviously, we can see fitted average lifetimes of 14.40 and 34.44 ns for the MnS and Spiro films, respectively, providing a proof of the superior hole-extraction ability of the MnS layer.45,46
Furthermore, the dependence of the photoelectric response on the incident light intensity was utilized to compare the recombination processes for both devices, as shown in Fig. S13a.† By linearly plotting Voc as a function of the log-scaled light intensity, the MnS-based PSC exhibits a smaller slope of 1.35 kT/q than that of the Spiro-based device (a slope of 1.58 kT/q) (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge); this indicates that MnS HTL can effectively reduce recombination at the HTL/perovskite interface, which can contribute to the improved device performance.45 To further examine the effect of the suppressed recombination process on the PSC performance, the dark J–V characteristics of MnS- and Spiro-based PSCs are demonstrated in Fig. S13b.† The dark J–V curves plotted on a semi-log scale clearly show that the MnS-based PSC device exhibits a smaller leakage current than the Spiro-based device, reflecting a higher shunt resistance and better hole selectivity, which are conducive to the improvement in Jsc.51 This can be mainly ascribed to the faster carrier transportation at the perovskite/HTL interface with fewer shunting pathways in the PSC based on MnS HTL.
Besides, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were also obtained to investigate the charge transport within PSCs. As shown in Fig. S14,† all the curves contain two circular arcs: the higher frequency arc is related to the charge transfer and the arc at the lower frequency is related to the charge recombination at the interfaces of the ETL/perovskite/HTL-based device. Notably, an increased interfacial recombination resistance and a decreased transfer resistance for the device based on MnS were observed compared to those of the device with Spiro HTL. These results were consistent with the Hall effect measurements of the MnS and Spiro samples listed in Table S5.† This further confirmed that the MnS film exhibited better electrical properties than Spiro-OMeTAD, where the hole mobility and conductivity were 4.50 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.32 × 10−3 S cm−1, respectively. For the Spiro-OMeTAD film, the hole mobility and conductivity were 1.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.64 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively.
To test the versatility of MnS HTL, the MAPbI3 perovskite film was changed to an FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 mixed perovskite active layer. As a result, the champion PCE of the MnS HTL-based device was 19.86%, while the value of the Spiro-based device increased to 18.44%, as shown in Fig. 5a. To the best of our knowledge, MnS-based devices indeed present the highest PCE values among the PSCs with inorganic HTLs in n–i–p without any interface modification, as listed in Table S6.† Moreover, Fig. 5b presents a statistical comparison of the averaged PCE of 20 separate cells with MnS and Spiro HTLs. Moreover, SD of the measurements is shown in Fig. S15.† On one hand, it further confirms that the device with MnS HTL has more excellent PCE than the device with Spiro HTL; on the other hand, it also indicates the good reproducibility of our solar cells.

Moreover, we examined the long-term stability in high humidity of the PSCs based on various HTLs without encapsulation for about 1000 h. To maintain high humidity, a home-made moisture test chamber equipped with a hygrometer and a bottle with deionized water was used, as presented in Fig. 6a. The chamber with 4 different samples was stored under dark conditions with a relative humidity of 80 ± 5%. The humidity stability of the devices based on various HTLs is shown in Fig. 6b. It can be seen that the devices based on MnS (Sample C or Sample D) have superior humidity stability than the devices based on Spiro HTL (Sample B). After about 600 h of storage, device B retained less than half of its initial PCE, reflecting quite significant and severe performance degradation due to the hydrophilicity of organic Spiro HTL. Remarkably, the unencapsulated device C retained beyond 90% of its initial PCE after aging for 1000 h, which was the same as that observed for device D. Not surprisingly, device A without HTL exhibited inferior stability because the perovskite is very sensitive to moisture.

Sample A: FTO/TiO2/perovskite/Au, Sample B: FTO/TiO2/perovskite/Spiro/Au, Sample C: FTO/TiO2/perovskite/MnS/Au, and Sample D: FTO/TiO2/mixed perovskite/MnS/Au. (b) The normalized PCE decay of devices based on various HTLs as a function of storage time under dark condition. The perovskite crystallinity evolution based on different HTLs: (c) the Spiro HTL and (d) the MnS HTL; ♦ and ♣ represent the identified PbI2 peaks and FTO peaks, respectively. Other peaks represent the main perovskite peaks. The insets of (c) and (d) show the water contact angles on the Spiro and MnS surfaces, respectively. 
To gain additional insights into the enhanced stability upon incorporation of MnS in PSCs, we utilized XRD patterns to investigate the crystallinity evolution of the perovskite protected by a Spiro or an MnS HTL under very high humidity of 80%. Please note that the introduction of Spiro or MnS on the perovskite layer did not affect the original peaks of the perovskite, as shown in Fig. 6c and d. After storage for 24 h, the perovskite manifested typical peaks of the tetragonal phase, and no PbI2 peaks were observed in both samples. However, after aging for 500 h, the perovskite based on MnS HTL showed a much lower (001) PbI2 peak than that based on Spiro HTL, which is mainly attributed to a higher water contact angle of the MnS layer than that of the Spiro sample. In general, we identify a contact angle of less than 60 degrees as a hydrophilic contact angle, and a contact angle greater than 60 degrees is called a hydrophobic contact angle. As is well-known, the surface wettability of the top HTL is an important factor that significantly affects the stability of PSCs.52 To further verify these results, the waterproofing capabilities of different HTLs by immersing the films directly in water for about 10 minutes are compared in Fig. S16.† The bare perovskite film (Sample A) turned yellow immediately after immersion into water due to the decomposition of the perovskite to PbI2. With the hydrophilic Spiro layer covering the top of the perovskite (Sample B), the brown color of this sample remained for about 5 min before turning yellow. Remarkably, the hydrophobic inorganic MnS layer (Sample C) coating the perovskite could further enhance the water resistance. After immersing in water for 10 min, except for the edge regions and some pinholes turning yellow, a large fraction still maintained the initial brown color of the perovskite. Therefore, these results manifested better preservation of the perovskite crystallinity against moisture infiltration for devices based on MnS.
As shown in Fig. 7a, under 1 sun illumination at their maximum power point, the Spiro-based devices showed poor photo-stability, losing more than 50% of their initial efficiency within 200 h. Comparatively, the devices based on MnS retained over 80% of their initial efficiency even after exposure to air with a relative humidity of 80% for 500 h without any encapsulation. More importantly, they also demonstrated better long-term stability under harsh conditions (85 °C, ∼80% humidity, 1 sun), retaining 80% of the initial efficiency after 400 h, as clearly shown in Fig. 7b. From the above discussion,53,54 we offer a promising approach for the industrialization of PSC-based photovoltaic technology with high throughput as well as long-term stability.
 Fig. 7  (a) Photo-stability was performed under continuous 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) at room temperature in ambient air. (b) Thermal stability of PSCs at a maximum-power-point under continuous 1 sun illumination at 85 °C in ambient air. The relative humidity was about 80% in ambient air. 
Conclusions
In summary, we reported a novel, green, and eco-friendly MnS film via the technique of vacuum vapor deposition without any solution and annealing processes, and it can be used as a potential HTL in PSCs. As a result, the optimized device based on MnS achieved high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.86% with negligible hysteresis, which was comparable to that of the Spiro-OMeTAD-based cell. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE achieved in this paper is one of the highest values ever reported for PSC devices with inorganic HTLs. Besides, the MnS-based PSC retained over 90% of its initial efficiency after storage in approximately 80% humidity for 1000 h without encapsulation. More importantly, it also demonstrated superior long-term stability under harsh conditions (85 °C, ∼80% humidity, 1 sun), retaining 80% of the initial efficiency after 400 h. These results highlight the great potential of MnS HTLs for achieving cost-effective and stable photovoltaic devices.
