    , Accepted 3rd January 2019First published on 3rd January 2019AbstractThe effect of dopants on photocatalytic activity has been extensively studied because of its potential for the smart design of more energy- and cost-efficient catalytic materials. Here, we investigated the quantitative effects of carbon dopants on TiO2 nanotube arrays for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. This was enabled by doping different concentrations of interstitial carbon into TiO2 nanotube arrays using thermal treatment with controlled exposure time to the carbon precursor (ethanol vapor). There was no change in the morphology of the nanotube arrays, but the dopant (or defect) levels that were introduced into the TiO2 band gap absorbed visible light (>425 nm) to overcome the relatively large band gap of the TiO2, which only reacts under UV light. We also examined interstitial carbon dopants that form oxygen vacancies, which can suppress the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers by temporarily trapping holes. Those two improvements increased the number of available charge carriers, resulting in enhanced PEC performance. The carbon doped TiO2 nanotube arrays fabricated under eight hours of ethanol exposure exhibited maximal efficiency and photocatalytic activity under simulated solar light.
1 Introduction
Fuel cells are one possibility for replacing fossil fuels without emitting carbon dioxide. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a valuable approach that uses solar energy for clean fuel production. Cleaving water into hydrogen and oxygen needs at least 1.23 V, assuming there is no overpotential and no non-spontaneous reactions. Thus, water splitting needs semiconductors or photoactive materials to proceed. PEC water splitting with TiO2 as a photocatalyst gained much attention after the study by Fujishima and Honda1 because TiO2 is abundant, corrosion resistant, non-toxic, and has the proper energy states for water splitting. However, TiO2 has a relatively large band gap (∼3.2 eV for the anatase phase and ∼3.02 eV for the rutile phase), which is in the ultra-violet region that only comprises 2–3% of the solar light on earth, and the photo-conversion efficiency is quite low. Absorbing visible light is one suggestion for increasing the efficiency. The other limitation of TiO2 is the fast recombination rate of the photogenerated electrons and holes (from picoseconds to microseconds depending on the measurement conditions2) because of the short diffusion length of the minority carriers (i.e. holes). In this study, we use a TiO2 nanotube structure to overcome this limitation. The TiO2 nanotube structure is more efficient than nanoparticles3,4 because of its large surface area, longer electron diffusion length,5,6 and stronger light scattering.6,7 Having a large contact area with the electrolyte helps to extract charge carriers more efficiently as well as reduce the diffusion path length.7 Photoanodes comprised of TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) are fabricated by anodization, which has been widely studied.8,9 This method is simple and it is easy to control the morphology of the nanotubes (e.g. wall thickness, length, and pore size) by changing either the applied potential or the anodization time; which gives rise to self-organization of TNA.
Dopants can significantly affect the photocatalytic activity.10–12 Anionic nonmetal dopants (e.g. carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, or boron) build defect energy levels slightly above the valence band of the TiO2 and absorb visible light,13–15 but they do not act as recombination sites. These defect levels are expected to narrow the band gap16,17 and the dopants themselves change the oxygen vacancies, which blocks reoxidation.18,19 With a sufficient amount of carbon dopant, TiO2 conductivity is improved by facilitating charge transfer at the interface with the electrolyte20 and by visible light absorbance by the defects,21,22 but the effect of defect concentration has not yet been clearly studied. Carbon dopants have a variety of possible substitution locations: into the Ti or O positions or at interstitial positions; they prefer to bind with O at interstitial sites.13 Carbon dopants accompany the oxygen vacancies, which trap photo-generated holes and can suppress the recombination of charge carriers. Trapped positive charge carriers can be released to the valence band and easily transfer to the interface with the electrolyte for further oxidation.8 In addition, carbon dopants in the TiO2 could enhance the absorbance of TNAs by elongating the absorption edge to the visible light region by introducing the defect level, or carbon 2p state.14,23 There are various methods for doping carbon into TiO2;24–27 anodization followed by thermal treatment with a carbon precursor (e.g. acetylene, ethanol, carbon monoxide) is one method.25,28 The carbon precursor molecule is first intercalated into the TNA lattice or attached to the surface of the TNAs. Through calcination, dehydrogenation then occurs and only carbon atoms are expected to be present.
The dependency on carbon concentration was theoretically presented in several research studies,29 but there are few experimental studies. Previous studies demonstrated that carbon doping in the TiO2 could be controlled by adjusting the temperature of the heat treatment, but this is accompanied by a phase (morphology) transition effect when the heating temperature changes.30 To remove the variation caused by morphological changes, we controlled the amount of carbon dopant by controlling the exposure time to the carbon precursor (i.e. ethanol vapor). In this study, we doped carbon into the TNA lattice to quantitatively see how carbon dopants affect PEC water splitting. The interstitial carbon dopants form a defect level that absorbs visible light; the photogenerated holes are temporarily trapped at the oxygen vacancies, suppressing the recombination of charge carriers. This procedure is presented in Fig. 1. The change in the number of available charge carriers is noted to measure the PEC performance with different concentrations of carbon dopant.

The photogenerated electrons are extracted backwards to the opposite Pt cathode and the photogenerated holes are directly transferred to the aqueous electrolyte. The photogenerated holes are temporarily trapped at the oxygen vacancy (Vo) and detached from the surface for water splitting. The blue spheres are O2− and the pink spheres are H+. 
2 Experimental
2.1 Anodization of TiO2 nanotube arrays
The TiO2 nanotube arrays were fabricated using anodization.8,31 A pristine Ti foil (50 μm, Nilaco) was sonicated sequentially in acetone, isopropyl alcohol, methanol, and finally ethanol for 5 min each. This Ti foil was attached to the anode. The counter electrode was stainless steel. The electrolyte contains ethylene glycol (17 M, 99.8% Sigma-Aldrich), distilled water (1.2 M), and ammonium fluoride (NH4F, 0.87 M, Junsei). The electrolyte was stirred for at least 30 minutes to remove any residues. The Ti foil and stainless steel stood 3 cm from each other in a two-electrode electrochemical setup; a bias of 70 V was applied for 30 minutes at room temperature and standard pressure. Anodization generates heat; thus, the beaker was in a cool-water bath during this procedure. The TNAs were subsequently fabricated on the Ti foil and then washed with distilled water. The dried TNAs were annealed in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 2 hours with a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 at standard pressure.
2.2 Carbon doping onto TNAs
Carbon doping of the TiO2 nanotube arrays was carried out by heat treatment at 500 °C for 3 hours with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 under Ar and air flux (1:1) in a tube furnace.22,25,30 Before calcination, the TNAs were exposed to the carbon precursor (i.e. ethanol vapor) for 2, 4, 8, or 16 hours. The carbon precursor is supposed to adsorb onto the surface of the TNAs, and then dehydrogenation occurs through calcination. These carbon-doped TNA (CTNA) samples are designated as 2 h treated CTNAs, 4 h treated CTNAs, 8 h treated CTNAs, and 16 h treated CTNAs, where each number indicates the exposure time. The fabrication was conducted to measure the UV-visible absorbance of the various TNAs and CTNAs. 1 μm of Ti was deposited onto the quartz at a rate of 0.5 Å s−1 using an E-beam evaporator (A-TECH system). The Ti-deposited quartz was then anodized at conditions identical to those presented in section 2.1, but only anodized for 4 minutes. Afterwards, the TNAs on quartz were annealed and calcined at conditions identical to those presented in the previous section.
2.3 Characterization of TNAs and CTNAs
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SU8230, Hitachi) and field emission transmission electron microscopy (200 kV, Tecnai F20, FEI) were used to examine the morphologies. To examine the crystalline structure, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a RIGAKU Ultima IV with a Cu Kα wavelength of 1.54 Å. A Raman microscope (Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution Visible_NIR) with a 514 nm laser was used at room temperature and standard pressure. The chemical compositions and oxidation states were inspected using a VG Scientific Sigma Probe X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) equipped with Al Kα radiation (1486.3 eV) under ultra-high vacuum of 10−10 Torr. The carbon content was determined using a CS244 carbon/sulfur determinator (LECO Coporation). A UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV3600) was used to characterize the optical properties.
2.4 Photocatalytic activity measurement
The photocatalytic activity was measured using a multichannel potentiostat (VersaStat3, Princeton Applied Research, USA) using a three-electrode system with a platinum coil as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (Saturated with KCl, RE-1B, BAS Inc.) as the reference electrode.32,33 The reference electrode was calibrated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).34 All potential values presented in all measurements were referenced to the hydrogen electrode, as shown in the ESI.† A single-compartment quartz cell filled with 1 M potassium chloride (KCl, Reagent grades, 90%, flakes, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the electrolyte. A 150 W Xe arc lamp (Model 10500, ABET Technology) was the light source. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were measured from 0 to 2.0 V versus RHE at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The potential was converted to the RHE scale using the Nernst equation (ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059·ph + 0.197). For the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), a monochrometer (Mmac 200, Dongwoo OPTRON) was used from 300 to 800 nm at a potential of 1.5 V versus RHE. The light intensity was calibrated from a Si diode as the photodiode (Bunkokeiki). The flat band potential was calculated using the Mott–Schottky equation. The capacitance was measured using an impedance frequency of 100 Hz with an identical three-electrode system but the electrolyte was 0.5 M sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, anhydrous, ≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich). The potential was applied from −0.8 to 0 V versus RHE.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of TNAs and CTNAs

Fig. 2a and b shows SEM images of the nanotubes. The pore size is 100 ± 10 nm, and the tube height is 8 ± 0.5 μm for all samples. The morphologies after heat treatment with the carbon precursor (ethanol vapor) are identical to the TNAs, thus the heat treatment did not affect the structure of the TNAs, as shown in Fig. 2c and d and Fig. S1.† Therefore, we examined whether the crystallinity was affected by calcination. The incorporation of carbon into TNAs was demonstrated by the results of the EDS (Fig. S2†), which shows the doping of carbon into TiO2; the atomic concentrations of carbon are about 2.2% and 10.8% for undoped TNAs and 16 h treated CTNAs, respectively. The TNAs were pre-annealed at 450 °C for 2 hours and crystalized into the anatase phase before being calcined for carbon doping. Therefore, the undoped TNAs show the anatase phase, as shown in the XRD pattern in Fig. 3. Usually when calcining at temperatures over approx. 500 °C, the TiO2 crystallinity starts to change to the rutile phase3,21 and have different characteristics. However, calcination with carbon doping does not change the TNA crystallinity and no rutile peak is observed in the XRD patterns even at 500 °C. The presence of the carbon suppresses the anatase-to-rutile phase transformation.35 The detected peaks are assigned to the anatase phase, and the unlabelled peaks belong to Ti, which is the substrate for the TNAs. No carbon-related peak is observed because of the low concentration in the system, but the presence of carbon dopants can be identified by the shift in the anatase peak, which is shown in the magnified XRD peaks in Fig. 3b–e. As the TNAs are exposed to the carbon precursor, the peaks shift to a narrower angle, which shows that the defects occur at the interstitial positions. The crystallinity was also examined using Raman spectroscopy with a 514 nm wavelength laser. The anatase TNAs phase did not change during calcination; the Eg modes are seen at 144, 196, and 638.5 cm−1, a doublet of the A1g and B1g modes are seen at 517 cm−1 and B1g at 395 cm−1 (Fig. S3a†).36,37 The Raman intensity of Eg increases with increasing carbon doping, which enhances the crystallinity of the TNAs.22 For the TNAs, the full width at half maximum values are almost identical for all the samples (i.e. approximately 19.6 cm−1). Fig. S3b† shows the carbon Raman spectra with the D band at 1376 cm−1 and the D′ band at 1666 cm−1; the D band denotes a disorder or defect and does not appear when there is a perfect infinite graphite structure.38,39 Therefore, the presence of carbon dopants are detected by the Raman spectroscopy.

The defects are expected to be carbonate species when interstitial carbon is doped into the TNAs. It was further analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectra of all the photoelectrodes exhibit all the peaks for Ti, O, and C. In comparison with that of the undoped TNAs, the XPS survey spectra of the CTNAs electrodes shows an obvious C 1s peak, which may arise from carbon doping. In particular, the atomic ratio of C to Ti estimated by XPS provides evidence that the carbon content is dependent on the ethanol exposure conditions (Fig. S4†). Additionally, the residual carbon content in the CTNAs was measured using a carbon element analyzer, as shown in Table S1.† The C 1s peak (Fig. S5a†) at 284.8 eV is assigned to adventitious carbon. The carbonate species appear as peaks at 286.5 eV (i.e. O–C–O bonds)25,40 or 288.9 eV (i.e. O–CO bonds).13 When carbon atoms were incorporated into the interstitial positions of the TiO2 lattice, carbonate species were formed.41 In the case of the Ti–C bond, which can be observed when carbon is substituted for the oxygen atom, it is usually observed at 282 eV, but this bond was not detected. This peak is usually observed in carbon-doped TiO2 prepared by heating a carbon-containing precursor.42 Therefore, it is more convincing that the carbon is stabilized at an interstitial position as a carbonate species binding with the O atom. The incorporation of carbon into the oxide lattice should influence the binding energy of O 1s as well. The peak at around 530 eV is the regular lattice oxygen and the peak at 531.5 eV is ascribed to the oxygen in the carbonate (Fig. S5b†).43 Table S2† show the atomic percentage of Ti, O, and C atoms based on the XPS spectra. For quantitative analysis of the composition, the peak area of each element was normalized with respect to XPS sensitivity factors and the atomic ratios for all the CTNAs were estimated. Accordingly, the XPS C 1s spectra support the presence of carbonates, which also increase with increased carbon doping.44 The carbonate species are highly correlated with the oxygen vacancies and the XPS peak is proportional to the presence of the carbonate species.45 Therefore, CTNAs with more carbon dopant are expected to have better photocatalytic activity because of the oxygen vacancies. The change in absorbance is easily recognized in Fig. S6.† TNAs are transparent yellow, but after calcination, they became an opaque brown color. The change in color shows that the absorption edge changes with the presence of carbon dopant; this is characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy with TNAs that are anodized on quartz to reduce reflection (Fig. S7†). UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. 4a) shows fluctuations in the absorbance at longer wavelengths caused by optical interference by the TNA structure.46 An obvious long tail when in visible light is caused by the formation of carbonate species.41Fig. 4b shows a Tauc plot of (αhν)0.5versus hν, where the absorption coefficient α and the indirect band gap Eg are related as given in eqn (1). α = A(hν − Eg)n/hν(1)where ν is the frequency, h is Planck's constant, and n = 0.5 for an allowed direct transition. The undoped TNAs have a band gap of 3.16 eV, and the CTNAs have shorter band gaps of 2.98, 2.87, and 2.75 eV, related to the exposure times to the carbon precursor of 2, 4, and 8 hours, respectively. Thus, the carbon dopants introduce defect levels that absorb visible light.

3.2 Photocatalytic activities of TNAs and CTNAS.
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) shows that the TNAs have an increasing photocurrent density with increasing carbon exposure time (Fig. 5a) under 100 mW cm−2 of white light, which includes both UV and visible light. Chronoamperometry with an external potential of 1.5 V versus RHE and light that was repeatedly turned on and off also showed the same trend (Fig. 5b). The 8 hour treated CTNAs have a current density of 1.56 mA cm−2, which is about 1.8 times higher than the undoped bare TNAs. In the chronoamperometry, the TNAs and CTNAs spontaneously and reproducibly reacted to the light transition; thus, both are sensitive to the light and the photoanode is stable in the electrolyte under the simulated solar light. The increasing photocurrent density could be explained in two ways: (1) supplementing charge carriers and (2) suppression of recombination. As the carbon 2p state penetrated into the valence band with sufficient potential, the valence band edge moved up toward higher energy states, and the band gap narrowed,29 thus CTNAs can absorb more solar energy in the visible light region to generate more charge carriers. The enhanced absorbance in visible light was characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy. The band gap was reduced by about 0.4 eV. The photoconversion efficiency was calculated using the following eqn (2) and the results are presented in Fig. S9.† (2)where Jph is the photocurrent density, Vapplied is the applied potential, and Plight is the applied light power density. In the three-electrode system, electrons are extracted to the back of the semiconductor and holes are transferred directly to the electrolyte without recombination. Thus, the transfer of charge carriers at the interface between the semiconductor and the electrolyte is one factor that influences the current density under solar light. The photoconversion efficiency increased with increasing carbon doping; there was no additional supply of charge carriers to the system except the simulated solar light. The highest efficiency was about 0.42% for the 8 h treated CTNAs, which is twice that of the undoped TNAs (0.21%), thus the transfer of charge carriers at the interface is enhanced by the carbon dopants.
 Fig. 5  (a) Linear sweep voltammetry measurements of undoped TNAs and the various CTNAs under white light (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and without light at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. (b) Chronoamperometry measurements at an external potential of 1.5 V versus RHE with repeated on/off of the white light. (c) IPCE measurements of the CTNAs and TNAs from 300 to 600 nm. (d) Magnified IPCE measurements of the samples from 425 to 475 nm. An external potential of 1.5 V versus RHE was applied. 
While the current density or photoconversion is enhanced by the carbon dopants, the specific wavelength that the CTNAs absorb is not known. Thus, the IPCE was calculated using the following eqn (3), as shown in Fig. 5c. (3)where Jph is the generated current density and Pphoton is the incident photons' power density at a specific wavelength of λ. We assume that a semiconductor absorbs all incident photons, even if a certain portion of the photons are reflected or scattered. The results support that the CTNAs have a smaller band gap and can absorb visible light (>425 nm) because a red shift is observed in Fig. 5d; thus, they generate more electron–hole pairs, which corresponds to the results from UV-vis spectroscopy and the observed trend shown based on the amount of carbon dopant. This concentration dependency was also suggested in the study by Sakthivel and Kisch.14 Band gap narrowing for absorbing visible light and an increase in charge transfer by suppression of recombination are the two ways to enhance PEC water splitting. Therefore, we measured the flat band potential to examine how charge carriers are affected by recombination through carbon doping.
When a semiconductor touches an electrolyte or metal, the semiconductor shows band bending to accommodate the potential difference between the Fermi level of the semiconductor and the work function of the metal or the redox potential of the electrolyte. The flat band potential is the potential needed to compensate for the band bending and becomes more negative as the band bends more when using an n-type semiconductor.47 The Mott–Schottky plot was measured under the same conditions as the photocatalytic activity measurements (Fig. 6a). As shown in Fig. 6b, the y-axis intercepts or flat band potentials change with the amount of carbon dopant in the TNAs. The flat band potentials are calculated using the Mott–Schottky equation48 as shown in eqn (4). (4)where C is the interfacial capacitance, A is the interfacial area, ND is the number of donors, V is the applied voltage, kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, e is the electronic charge, and Vfb is flat band potential. The flat band potential decreases from −0.75 to −0.79 V, which means that the band bends more as the amount of carbon dopant increases. As a result, a stronger electric field is applied to the semiconductor, which enhances the electron–hole separation and makes holes, or minority carriers, transfer easily to the electrolyte for water oxidation. The separation of charge carriers is also affected by oxygen vacancies, which act as temporal trap sites for the holes. The chemical bond is weak and holes can be easily detached and transferred to the electrolyte for water oxidation.

The photocatalytic activity of the 8 h treated CTNAs was outstanding compared with the other cases. It might be that the amount of carbon dopant is optimal in the 8 h treated CTNAs for forming defect levels for visible light absorbance29,49 and to generate oxygen vacancies to trap holes. If there is too little carbon doping, the dopant cannot absorb visible light and generate electron–hole pairs, nor does the carbon 2p state penetrate into the band gap of the TiO2. The CNTs with more carbon dopant (i.e. 16 h treated CTNAs) can absorb more solar energy in the visible light region to generate more charge carriers because of the narrowed bandgap. Initially in the reaction (potential range <0.7 V), the flux of hole carriers to the interface can be injected into the electrolyte and react. If the hole injection to the interface is greater than the reaction rate, holes accumulate, which results in photocurrent loss.50 Furthermore, the 16 h treated CTNAs show a low saturated current density compared with the 8 h treated CTNAs because of overfull carbon dopant and oxygen vacancies.51 The distance between each dopant is shortened, thus the holes are trapped at successive oxygen vacancies and would eventually recombine with electrons rather than transfer to the surface of the CTNAs. Overall, this study suggests that carbon doping is a facile way to tune the electronic properties of TNAs and to enhance the activity for photoelectrochemical water splitting.
4 Conclusions
We doped carbon into TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) via calcination to study how carbon dopants act in a photoelectrochemical water splitting system and to quantitatively determine their effect. The calcination did not affect the structure or crystallinity of the TNAs, but it did enhance the anatase phase. A shift in the XRD patterns shows that the amount of carbon dopant increases with longer exposure to the carbon precursor (i.e. ethanol vapor), and a narrower peak width reveals that the carbon dopant is inserted at the interstitial positions and binds to the O atoms to form a carbonate species (O–CO or O–C–O). The amount of carbon dopant can be regulated by controlling the exposure time to the ethanol vapor, which effectively introduces a defect level that absorbs visible light and creates oxygen vacancies to hinder the recombination of charge carriers.
The total number of charge carriers increased with increasing carbon doping as the photocurrent density was enhanced because of visible light (>425 nm) absorbance, which appeared as a red-shift in the IPCE, and by suppressing recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers, which occurs because of the stronger electric field and the availability of oxygen vacancies. The photocatalytic efficiency is enhanced by larger band bending in the carbon-doped TNAs, as revealed by the increased flat band potential, and by oxygen vacancies trapping holes. The PEC performance is affected by the carbon dopant. If the carbon dopant level is too high, the photogenerated holes are trapped in the oxygen vacancies and cannot be used for water oxidation; however, the defect level and oxygen vacancies do not properly develop when the carbon dopant level is too low.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Scheme of TNAs with carbon dopants for PEC water splitting. The TNAs are grown on Ti foil. The photogenerated electrons are extracted backwards to the opposite Pt cathode and the photogenerated holes are directly transferred to the aqueous electrolyte. The photogenerated holes are temporarily trapped at the oxygen vacancy (Vo) and detached from the surface for water splitting. The blue spheres are O2− and the pink spheres are H+.	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM images of (a) undoped TNAs, (b) cross section of the TNAs, and (c) 8 h treated CTNAs. (d) TEM image of the 8 h treated CTNAs.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) X-ray diffraction spectra of the undoped TNAs and various CTNAs. A denotes the anatase phase. The unlabelled peaks belong to the Ti foil, which is the substrate for the TNAs. (b)–(e) Magnified XRD spectra of the anatase phases.	 
α = A(hν − Eg)n/hν	(1)

 	Fig. 4  (a) UV-visible spectra of the undoped TNAs and various CTNAs that were fabricated on quartz. (b) Tauc plot of the undoped TNAs and the various CTNAs.	 
	(2)

 	Fig. 5  (a) Linear sweep voltammetry measurements of undoped TNAs and the various CTNAs under white light (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and without light at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. (b) Chronoamperometry measurements at an external potential of 1.5 V versus RHE with repeated on/off of the white light. (c) IPCE measurements of the CTNAs and TNAs from 300 to 600 nm. (d) Magnified IPCE measurements of the samples from 425 to 475 nm. An external potential of 1.5 V versus RHE was applied.
