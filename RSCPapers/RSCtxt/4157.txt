    , Accepted 13th February 2020First published on 13th February 2020AbstractElectrochemical CO2 reduction rates are limited in aqueous-based electrolytes by the low solubility of CO2. We recently demonstrated that organic solvent-based CO2 Expanded Electrolytes (CXEs) can solubilize multi-molar amounts of CO2 at moderate pressures while retaining sufficient supporting electrolyte to facilitate electrochemistry. Up to an order of magnitude enhancement in CO2 reduction rates to CO was achieved on polycrystalline Au electrodes at faradaic efficiencies approaching 80%. Herein, we show that similar enhancements are observed on Cu catalysts as well, on the basis of enhanced current flow. On both systems, a maximum in CO2 reduction rate was observed at ca. 5 M CO2 concentration (i.e., 3.1 MPa head-space pressure) beyond which the rate decreases. To explain this counterintuitive phenomenon, we developed a detailed COMSOL-based mechanistic model of CO2 reduction in organic electrolytes under elevated pressures on Au electrodes. This model incorporates the dissimilar variations of the key physicochemical properties (viz., CO2 concentration, CO2 diffusion rate, and solution polarity) with CO2 pressure. We thereby demonstrate that the overall rate is limited by CO2 concentrations at lower than optimum CO2 pressures. At pressures higher than the optimum the rate is limited by both an attenuation of the first electron-transfer step and an increase in the ohmic resistance of the system. Excellent quantitative match between experimental and model-predicted rates lend credence to the proposed underlying mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction in CXEs. These fundamental insights provide guidance for the rational design and scaleup of highly efficient CXE-based CO2 reduction systems.
1. Introduction
Carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas that has been implicated in contributing to global climate change, also has potential as a valuable feedstock for making fuels and chemicals. However, the facile chemical activation of CO2 remains a grand challenge in sustainability science.1–4 Of the many reported ways to convert CO2, electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising method because it operates at low temperatures and can be powered by carbon-free renewable energy such as solar or wind.5–9 Even though several large-scale electrolysis technologies have been commercialized historically (e.g., the production of chlorine via the chlor-alkali process10 and the extraction of metals via electrowinning11), the practical viability of electrochemical CO2 reduction has thus far have been stymied by several technical obstacles.12 One such roadblock is the poor solubility of CO2 in conventional aqueous solvents.13 At ambient pressure, CO2 solubility in aqueous electrolytes is approximately 0.034 M, and this low concentration limits the overall rate. Per Henry's Law, it is possible to linearly increase CO2 concentration in aqueous media by simply increasing the head-space CO2 pressure.14 However, even at the elevated pressures (e.g., 50 bars) investigated, the linear increase in CO2 concentration is still too low in aqueous solvents to achieve practically relevant reaction rates.15 Thus, to increase CO2 reduction rates, a system that uses other ways to enhance CO2 availability at the electrode is needed.
Major improvements have been reported in CO2 conversion rates by enhancing local CO2 concentrations through the utilization of gas diffusion electrodes.16–20 Gas-diffusion electrodes allow for CO2 reduction systems to be operated at current densities that are ca. ten times higher than those achieved using planar metal electrodes.19 Another attempted approach to enhance the CO2 reduction rate is to engineer the catalyst surface with increased surface area and number of catalytically active sites.21–26 However, in all of these approaches, the low concentration of CO2 in aqueous electrolytes may still be a critical impediment to achieving higher reaction rates.
To overcome the problem of CO2 starvation at the electrode surface, we recently reported the use of CO2-expanded solvents as reaction medium.27 Upon CO2 pressurization, the liquid phase volumetrically expands as the CO2 concentration increases. The CO2-expanded medium also sufficiently solubilizes supporting electrolyte in this range of pressures to facilitate electrochemistry.27 Hence, we have termed these new electrochemical reaction media as CO2-Expanded Electrolytes (CXEs). Specifically, we have shown that at multi-molar CO2 concentrations, tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate remains in solution and fast outer-sphere electron-transfers (e.g., ferrocene/ferrocenium) can be carried out in CXEs across a wide range of CO2 concentrations.27 Most interestingly, we observed a non-monotonic pressure dependence of the CO2 reduction rate (to CO) on polycrystalline Au in CXE media. We observed a maximum in CO2 reduction rate at 3.1 MPa (corresponding to a CO2 concentration of 5 M) representing an order of magnitude enhancement compared to the rate achieved at ambient pressure. At higher CO2 pressures (and therefore higher liquid phase concentrations) exceeding this optimum, the electrochemical CO2 activity decreases and eventually reaches values similar to that achieved at ambient pressure.
In this work, we have extended the CXE concept to CO2 reduction with polycrystalline Cu catalysts to demonstrate the versatility of CXE media. On the Cu catalyst, we observed a similar non-monotonic change in CO2 reduction rate with CO2 head space pressure as seen on polycrystalline Au. Moreover, we observed that the optimum rate occurred at the same CO2 concentration (ca. 5 M at 3.1 MPa head-space pressure) on both catalysts. Further, we present a complementary mathematical model that provides insights into the physicochemical processes underlying electrochemical CO2 reduction in CXE media. The model successfully deconvolutes the pressure effects on the competing properties (liquid phase CO2 concentrations, CO2 diffusivity, and solution resistance) of CXEs that give rise to the experimentally observed maximum in electrocatalytic activity. These findings show that, in order to intensify electrochemical CO2 reduction rates the reaction medium as well as the catalysts must be rationally designed to effectively harness the unique properties of CO2-expanded electrolytes. These fundamental insights represents a significant advance in the effort to achieve practically relevant rates of CO2 conversion for use in industrial-scale technologies.28,29
2. Materials and methods
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction experiments were performed in a custom fabricated pressure cell as previously described.27 Briefly, a custom cap with threaded electrical feedthroughs was mated to a 50 mL Parr reactor to create the body of the cell. Commercially supplied liquid CO2 (Matheson, Research Grade, purity level 99.999%) was used to pressurize the vessel. Electrochemical data was collected using a Gamry Reference 3000 Potentiostat/Galvanostat. Cyclic voltammogram data for a gold microelectrode (0.000314 cm2) and a Cu (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) disk electrode (0.0177 cm2) were obtained at various CO2 head-space pressures in acetonitrile containing dissolved tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, electrochemical grade). The initial electrolyte concentration was 0.4 M. The volume of the liquid phase expands upon CO2 dissolution at progressively higher pressures giving rise to a continuum of CXEs with tunable properties. The variations of the CXE volume and CO2 concentrations in the CXEs were previously quantified in a Jurgeson® cell as described elsewhere.27
3. COMSOL simulation of CO2 electroreduction in CXEs
COMSOL (COMSOL Multiphysics® v. 5.3) simulations were used to model CO2 electroreduction on a gold microelectrode in CXEs. The simulation field is shown in ESI, Fig. S1.† The simulated reactor geometry was created as a 2D axial-symmetric domain with the electrode size (100 μm radius), insulating sheath size (10 μm width) and reactor dimensions (1 cm radius, 2 cm height). This reactor size was chosen because it is sufficiently larger than the boundary layer surrounding the electrode. Thus the CO2 concentration at the outer boundary is the same as the reactor bulk concentration because of the limited diffusion profile around the microelectrode. A free triangular mesh using COMSOL's built-in ‘normal’ element size was used for the bulk of the reactor, with an ‘extremely fine’ mesh used for the area near the electrode (1.5 mm × 2.5 mm). An edge mesh was incorporated with a maximum mesh element of 2 × 10–5 cm and a minimum mesh element of 2 × 10–6 cm for increased spatial resolution near the electrode.
The concentration profiles of CO2 and CO were simulated using the ‘Transport of Diluted Species’ module in COMSOL. This module uses Fick's law of diffusion [eqn (1)] to describe concentration gradients in the region around the electrode. (1)
Experimentally measured initial CO2 concentrations in CXEs at the various pressures were taken from our previous work.27 The CO2 diffusion coefficients in the CXE medium at various pressures were taken from values reported elsewhere.30 ‘No flux’ boundary conditions where used at the reactor wall and insulation sheath of the electrode. A flux boundary condition for both CO2 and CO was used at the electrode surface with the flux of each species governed by the reaction mechanism as shown in Table 1 (detailed description of the mechanism discussed in section 4.2). Specifically, the net flux of CO2 is governed by the relative rates of the first and second reaction steps as shown in eqn (2). JCO2 = −r1 − r2(2)

Similarly the flux of CO is dependent on the reaction rate of the fourth step as shown in eqn (3). JCO = r4(3)
The “Surface Reactions Physics” module in COMSOL was used to model the CO2 reduction steps. The total site density was specified as 1.2 × 10–4 mol m−2. Here the rate of formation of each intermediate species (Ri) is described by eqn (4)–(6). (4) (5) RCO(ads) = r3 − r4(6)
Rate constant dependence on applied potential was taken into account by incorporating irreversible Butler–Volmer type kinetics into the kinetic rate constant as follows: k1 = k10e−αf(E−E°)(7)where k10 is the electron-transfer rate constant, α = 0.3 is the transfer coefficient, E is the potential of the electrode, E° is an effective standard reduction potential, and f = F/RT in which F is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.
The current is calculated from the flux of electrons at the electrode surface as follows: (8)where A is the area of the electrode and n is number of electrons transferred in each reactions. Since this is a three dimensional model and the concentration profile is not necessarily constant across the electrode surface, thus the actual current is estimated as: (9)were a is the radius of the electrode.
The model uses the experimental potential versus time data from the cyclic voltammogram, and regresses the appropriate reaction rates and intermediate species concentrations at each time step. Once the current is calculated from eqn (9), the effect of the ohmic resistance is then determined. The experimental ohmic resistances at various pressures were measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and used in the model for iRu correction. The values of each ki can then be found via regression by matching the simulated voltammogram to the experimental voltammogram.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Pressure tunability of CXE properties
As with CO2-Expanded Liquids (CXLs),31 the physical properties of CXEs can be tuned by changing the CO2 head-space pressure. Fig. 1 shows the pressure-tunability of several key properties that affect electrocatalytic rates. Fig. 1a shows that the volume of the electrolyte-containing acetonitrile solution expands exponentially as CO2 dissolves into the liquid phase. At a pressure of ca. 5 MPa, the CXE volume expands up to three times its initial value. The corresponding liquid phase CO2 concentrations in the CXE phase shown in Fig. 1b. The CO2 concentrations achievable in CXE media far exceed those attainable in aqueous electrolytes. For example, the CO2 concentrations in water at 25 °C is 1.0 M at 3 MPa and 1.7 M at 5 MPa. In contrast, CO2 concentrations in CXEs at 25 °C are 5 M and 13 M at 3 MPa and 5 MPa, respectively. In fact, CO2 concentrations in CXEs approach that of pure liquid CO2 (16.1 M) at 25 °C and pressures exceeding 5 MPa.

In addition to the pressure-tunability of CO2 concentrations in CXEs, the CO2 diffusion coefficient in CXEs also increases with CO2 pressure. Fig. 1c shows the variation of computed CO2 diffusion coefficients in CO2-expanded acetonitrile with pressure.30 Upon increasing CO2 dissolution with pressure, the CXE transport properties trend towards becoming gas-like with a decrease in viscosity of the liquid phase and a concomitant increase in the CO2 diffusion coefficient.
The increased CO2 concentrations and improved CO2 diffusion rates in CXEs would be expected to favor CO2 electroreduction rates. However, the ohmic resistance of the Au/CXE system, as measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with fitting to a Randles equivalent circuit (see ESI Fig. S2–S5†), also increases with head-space CO2-pressure (Fig. 1d). This increase in resistance could inhibit the electron transfer rates associated with CO2 electroreduction in CXEs. In sharp contrast, our previous experiments with a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite electrode show a negligible increase in resistance at increased CO2 pressures.27
We performed cyclic voltammetry over a wide range of CO2 pressures for on both polycrystalline Au and Cu to better understand how the interplay between these pressure tunable properties affect the overall CO2 electroreduction rates. We observed that for both catalysts, there was a non-monotonic relationship between CO2 reduction activity and CO2 pressure (Fig. 2). On each electrocatalyst, we observed modest CO2 reduction activity at near ambient CO2 pressure (0.17 MPa). When the CO2 pressure is increased to 3.1 MPa, there is a dramatic increase in the measured current. However, as the CO2 pressure is increased beyond 3.1 MPa, there was an unexpected decrease in current density. At 5.1 MPa CO2 pressure, the current density diminished approaching values observed at near ambient CO2 pressures. This trend is preserved when the voltammograms are iR-corrected using the individual resistances measured at each pressure (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, the shape of the voltammetry of the iR-corrected catalytic response at the optimum pressure is reminiscent of those observed during electrochemical hydrogen evolution in strong acid.32 This suggests that CO2 availability is not limiting at these conditions.

In order to better understand the causative factors behind the occurrence of a maximum electrocatalytic CO2 reduction rate at an intermediate CO2 pressure, it is essential to deconvolute how the CO2 concentration, CO2 diffusion rate and ohmic resistance in the CXE medium are each affected by pressure. To accomplish this task, we employed the COMSOL simulation tool to model the CO2 diffusion rate and CO2 electroreduction kinetics. We chose to model the Au/CXE system because Au is well known to produce CO with high selectivity via a known mechanism.15 In contrast, Cu is known to make several gas and liquid-phase products, and the CO2 reduction mechanism on Cu catalysts is not as clear as on Au catalysts.15 However, we have confirmed that the formation of gas-phase product CO is attenuated at 5.1 MPa vs. 3.1 MPa in the Cu/CXE system (see ESI Fig. S7 and S8†), in line with the corresponding electrochemical data. More systematic studies of the effects of operating conditions on product distribution for the Cu/CXE system are underway.
4.2. Mechanism of electrochemical CO2 reduction in the CXE media
To describe the CO2 reduction kinetics, we went beyond the typical one-electron, Butler–Volmer approximation and developed a kinetic model that simulates each elementary reaction step in the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO. The well-known mechanism, as described by Hori and co-workers, for CO2 reduction on polycrystalline gold in aprotic, non-aqueous media is shown in Fig. 3.15 The first step in this mechanism is the transfer of an electron to CO2 to form an adsorbed CO2˙− radical on the catalyst surface. A second CO2 molecule then reacts with the adsorbed radical to form an adsorbed OCOCO2˙− species. A subsequent electron transfer then forms free CO32− and an adsorbed CO which then desorbs releasing the site to continue the catalytic cycle. It should be noted that while this catalytic cycle involves a two-electron transfer mechanism, it does not represent the two-electron, two-proton transfer mechanism that typically occurs in aqueous electrolytes. Furthermore, this model does not rely upon protons to be oxide acceptors as expected under our aprotic conditions. However, the product carbonate, a strong base under reaction conditions, could liberate protons from the tetrabutylammonium cations in the supporting electrolyte via Hoffman degradation in a non-rate determining step. Because we took precautions to maintain our reaction system to be free of protons via extensive drying of the electrolyte and utilization of high purity CO2, the proposed mechanism should adequately capture the key features of CO2 reduction in the CXE media.
 Fig. 3  Illustrative reaction mechanism for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on Au. 

Table 1 shows the equations used to describe the aforementioned electrochemical CO2 reduction rates. The rate of the first reaction step, electron transfer to and adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface, is taken to be first-order with respect to CO2 concentration at the electrode surface and first-order with respect to the number of available sites, S* on the catalyst surface. The potential-dependent nature of this reaction step is taken into account by incorporating irreversible Butler–Volmer type kinetics [eqn (7)].
The rate of the second reaction step, CO2 addition to the adsorbed CO2˙− radical at the electrode surface to form OCOCO2˙−, is also taken to be first-order in CO2˙−(ads) and first-order in CO2 concentration at the electrode surface. The effective rate constant for this step that does not involve electron transfer is k2.
The rate of the third reaction step, the electron transfer to the adsorbed OCOCO2˙−(ads) radical to form CO with the release of carbonate, is taken to be first-order in OCOCO2˙−(ads). Analogous to the first step, k3 is dependent on the electrode potential as per irreversible Butler–Volmer kinetics. The final step in the mechanism is the desorption of CO which is assumed to be first order with respect to CO(ads).
Employing this kinetic model, we simulated the cyclic voltammetry data at various pressures by regressing the kinetic parameters for each reaction step. As discussed earlier, values of CO2 diffusion coefficients, CO2 concentrations, scan rate, and CXE ohmic resistance are either measured or estimated at each pressure and are supplied as model inputs. The ki values for each reaction were regressed to fit the experimental data. As shown in Fig. 4, excellent fits of the simulated and experimental cyclic voltammetry data for polycrystalline Au were obtained at CO2 pressures of 0.17, 1.44, 3.13, 4.48, and 5.10 MPa. The known and regressed parameters are shown in Table 2.

The regressed parameters provide insights into why an optimum exists for electrochemical CO2 reduction as a function of CO2 head-space pressure. The increased resistance of the system at higher CO2 pressures partially explains the observed maximum in the electrochemical CO2 reduction rates. While the increased resistance causes a decrease in the slope of the catalytic wave, it is not responsible for the change in the onset potential to more negative potentials. That change in onset potential is due to thedecrease in the rate constant associated with the first step (k10) with increasing CO2 pressure. These results are consistent with the equivalent circuit modelling of the EIS data, which shows essentially no change in the charge-transfer resistance between atmospheric conditions and 3.1 MPa, but an order of magnitude increase in the charge-transfer resistance between 3.1 MPa and 5.1 MPa (see ESI for details, and Tables S1–S3† for the resistance values). We observed no change in the values of the apparent rate constants for the second, third, and fourth elementary reaction over the pressure range.
The model results also provide several key insights into the rate-determining steps of electrochemical CO2 reduction, that are not discernible by experiments carried out solely at ambient CO2 concentration. First, the model demonstrates that under ambient pressure r1 (the first electron-transfer step) is the rate-determining step at all potentials. To elucidate rate-determining steps, we assumed different kinetic rate constants for each of the four mechanistic steps. The response of a catalyst at ambient CO2 pressure, starting with the ki values found for Au, and varying each ki value one at a time across several orders of magnitude was investigated (see ESI, Fig. S9†). Increasing the value of k10 while maintaining k2, k30, and k4 values constant improves the catalyst performance at low (i.e., less negative) potentials for CO production (see Fig. S9a†). In contrast, increasing k2, k30, or k4, while maintaining k10 constant, does not increase the rate of CO formation, indicative of r1 being rate-determining (see Fig. S9b–S9d†). However, the reason for r1 limiting the overall rate is different at lower (i.e. less negative) potentials than at higher (i.e. more negative) potentials. At low potentials, the kinetics of the electron transfer (i.e., k1) are limiting the rate of reaction as demonstrated by the theoretical shift in the onset potential for electrochemical CO2 reduction to less negative potentials. However, at high potentials (i.e., more negative), the maximum attainable current is the same regardless of the value of k10. Recall that r1 is expressed as: r1 = k1[CO2][S*](10)where k1 is a function of potential as described in eqn (7). Thus, at high potentials, the overall rate is limited not by the value of k1 but rather by either the CO2 concentration at the electrode surface and/or [S*], the concentration of unoccupied surface sites.

Fig. 5a shows simulations of theoretical catalysts under ambient CO2 pressure keeping all values of the ki found for Au, but increasing the total number of available catalytic sites. Again, under more negative potentials, the rate of reaction (i.e., current) is the same regardless of the catalytic site density. This shows that CO2 concentration at the electrode surface limits the overall CO2 reduction at ambient conditions.
 Fig. 5  Simulated cylcic voltammagrams of theoretical catalysts at various catalytic site densities (red – 1.2 × 10−4 mol m−2, orange – 12 × 10−4 mol m−2, green – 60 × 10−4 mol m−2, blue – 120 × 10−4 mol m−2, black – experimental on polycrystalline Au) at both ambient pressure (a) and 3.1 MPa (b). 
At the optimum CO2 pressure (3.1 MPa), the overall rate is dictated by the electron-transfer kinetics (both k10 and k30) as well as the overall catalyst site density. Unlike at ambient CO2 pressure, increasing only k10 does not increase the overall rate of reaction. In fact, when the ki values are varied one at a time it is not possible to significantly increase the rate of reaction simply by increasing only one rate constant (see ESI, Fig. S10†). However, keeping all of the ki values identical to those found for Au, but increasing the catalytic site density (Fig. 5b) does show a significant increase in the theoretical performance. This demonstrates that, contrary to under ambient pressure conditions, CO2 concentration at the electrode surface does not limit the overall rate when the bulk CO2 concentration is at ca. 5 M. Under these conditions, the reaction rate is mainly limited by the number of catalytic sites available.
Additional gains in catalytic activity could be made at the optimum CO2 pressure if a catalyst were designed to increase both k10 and k30 simultaneously (see ESI, Fig. S12b†). At 3.1 MPa, an initial increase in k10 does not show a dramatic effect on the electrochemical CO2 reduction activity; however, an increase in k30 enhances catalyst performance. In sharp contrast, at ambient pressure (ESI, Fig. S12a†), increasing k10 will increase catalytic activity, but a subsequent increase in k30 does not offer additional performance enhancements. This signifies that in order to increase CO2 reduction rates under the optimum CO2 concentration, a catalyst needs to be designed with increased number of catalytic sites that favor fast electron-transfer kinetics for both the first and third steps. Under ambient pressure conditions, a catalyst need only be designed to have fast electron-transfer kinetics for the first step. The number of sites nor the kinetics of the subsequent steps do not have significant effects at ambient pressure. Thus, combining higher active site density catalysts with a CXE is a better strategy for higher CO2 reduction rates than under ambient pressure conditions.
At the highest CO2 pressures tested, the overall rate is controlled by the sluggish electron-transfer kinetics of the first step and the resistivity of the system (see ESI, Fig. S11†). This can be seen by the increased catalytic activity at increased values of k10. However, there is a point beyond which increasing the value of k10 alone does not keep improving the overall performance of the system, analogous to the intermediate pressure regime.
5. Conclusion
This study has elucidated the various competing effects on electrochemical CO2 conversion rates as the liquid-phase CO2 concentration is increased in CO2-rich acetonitrile-based electrolytes. We observed a maximum in the electrochemical CO2 reduction rate at an intermediate optimum CO2 concentration (i.e., pressure). Beyond the optimum, the higher CO2 concentrations increase the ohmic resistance of the system and also inhibit the kinetics of the first electron-transfer step. Fortunately, the optimum pressure (3.13 MPa) at which the electrocatalytic reduction rate is maximized is quite mild and in the range of many current industrial chemical processes. The existence of an optimum CO2 concentration has important implications for rationally designing electrochemical CO2 reduction systems. The simulations clearly show that sophisticated nanostructured catalysts may not be able to fully utilize their high active site density at CO2 concentrations below the optimum. Further, the systematic design of compatible electrolyte/solvent/catalyst combination will be essential for achieving practically relevant electrochemical CO2 reduction rates.
