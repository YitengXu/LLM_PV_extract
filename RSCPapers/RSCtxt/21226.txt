    , Accepted 4th November 2011First published on 13th December 2011AbstractFlower-like BaTiO3 nanotube arrays (NTAs) were successfully prepared by a hydrothermal method using TiO2 NTAs as precursors. Ag-loaded BaTiO3 NTAs were formed by a photochemical reduction method. The samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra. The results show that Ag nanoparticles can be homogeneously dispersed on the surface of BaTiO3 NTAs. The loaded Ag exists in the form of a metal. The photocatalytic activity of Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs was evaluated from the analysis of the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO). It is found that the pH value strongly influences photocatalytic activity of the films, and Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs perform excellent photocatalytic activity at a low pH value. In addition, the effect of concentration of AgNO3 dipping solution on the photocatalytic degradation of MO was also studied.
1. Introduction
Semiconductor photocatalysis have attracted extensive attention for potential environmental applications such as air purification, water disinfection, and hazardous water remediation in the past decade.1–4 Among the photocatalysts, TiO2 has been intensively investigated for its strong oxidizing power, nontoxic, low-cost and chemically stable.5–7 However, the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation is limited because of its high rate of recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in the case of nanoparticle dispersed systems.8 Several attempts have been adopted to enhance the photocatalytic activity of titania, such as metal cations doping,9nonmetal anions doping10–12 and surface modification with noble metal.13–15 For improvement of photocatalytic activity, nanoparticles with large specific surface areas were frequently used because of the large number of reaction sites. In addition, different morphological TiO2 also affected its photocatalytic activity, such as TiO2 nanorods,16nanowires,17 and nanotubes.18

        Titania or titanate nanotubes have been intensively investigated due to their large surface area, pore volume and size-dependent properties, as well as their potential application to dye sensitized solar cells, gas sensors and photocatalysts.19,20 In recent years, highly ordered TiO2 NTAs fabricated by electrochemical anodization have become a kind of interesting inorganic materials. This architecture offers the ability to influence the absorption and propagation of light through the architecture.21 Moreover, the photogenerated electrons can be fast and efficiently transferred leading to a much reduced electron-hole recombination. Therefore, photocatalytic efficiency might be improved by utilization of the geometrical structure. Many reports indicated that the formation of self-organized TiO2 nanotubes by anodization of Ti have shown excellent photocatalytic activity for degradation of organic pollutants.22,23
However, there are a few reports focusing on the fabrication of ordered BaTiO3 NTAs,24 their nanocomposite structures and application in photocatalysis. Because the preparation of nanotube arrays with perovskite structure (ABO3) remains a challenge in materials science.25–28 Moreover, it was reported that decorating TiO2 NTAs with suitable nanoparticles of Ag can enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 significantly.29,30 Therefore, in this work, Ag-loaded flower-like BaTiO3 NTAs are prepared through the combination of anodic oxidation, hydrothermal synthesis and photo-reduction technology. The phase structures, morphologies and pore structures were investigated and discussed. The photocatalytic activity of this novel nanotube composite system was then evaluated by quantifying the photodegradation of methyl orange.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of Ag loaded BaTiO3 nanotube arrays

          Titania
          NTAs were grown by anodization of titanium foils. The titanium foils were ultrasonically cleaned followed by acetone and deionized water prior to anodization. A two-electrode electrochemical cell connected to a direct-current power supply was used for anodization. Titanium foils were used as anode and the counter electrode, respectively. The interval between the two electrodes was 5 cm. The TiO2 nanotube array film was formed by anodizing the titanium foil in glycol solution containing 0.5 wt % NH4F and 3 wt % H2O at 60 V for 1 h. After the anodic oxidation, the TiO2 nanotube array film was washed by using deionized water to remove the electrolyte.
Thereafter, TiO2 NTAs grown on Ti substrates were used as templates to form flower-like BaTiO3 NTAs by a hydrothermal method. Solutions of 0.05 M barium hydroxide in CO2-free deionized water were poured into Teflon-lined hydrothermal vessels and heat treated at 150 °C for 2 h, forming well-ordered BaTiO3 NTAs.
To obtain Ag loaded flower-like BaTiO3 NTAs, we used the following two methods. One is that the above synthesized samples of flower-like BaTiO3 NTAs were directly irradiated with a 350 W mercury lamp in 20 mL 0.5 M AgNO3 aqueous solution for 3 h (photodeposition approach). The other is that flower-like BaTiO3 NTAs were immersed in a beaker filled with 10 mL 0.5 M AgNO3 aqueous solution at 60 °C for 24 h before irradiation (photochemical approach). Subsequently, the samples were soaked in 20 mL methanol solution and irradiated with a 350 W mercury lamp to reduce Ag+ to metallic Ag in the form of nanoparticles.
2.2. Characterization

          X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/max-RB X-ray diffractometer, using Cu-Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. Morphology observation was performed on a HITACHI S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was conducted with a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope, using 200 kV accelerating voltage. The surface chemical composition of samples was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS measurements were carried out with a Physical Electronics PHI 5700 ESCA system with an Al Kα X-ray source. All binding energies were calibrated to C–C C1s peak at 285 eV of the surface adventitious carbon. UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) were measured for the catalysts using a UV-vis spectrometer (Hitachi U-4100), and they were converted from reflection to absorbance through the standard Kubelka–Munk method.
2.3. Photocatalytic measurements
The photocatalytic activities of the prepared catalysts were evaluated by the degradation of methyl orange solution. The photocatalytic degradation was performed in a 100 mL cylindrical quartz reactor with water cooling. BaTiO3 nanotube array film or Ag loaded BaTiO3 nanotube array film with an area of 6 cm2 was placed in 75 mL of aqueous methyl orange solution with an initial concentration of 20 mg L−1. A 350 W high-pressure mercury lamp was used as the UV light source. The film was kept at a 10 cm distance from the light source. The concentration of the obtained MO solution was determined by measuring the absorbance periodically every 15 min using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 45 UV-vis Spectrometer and an UV-vis spectrophotometer-722 M during the photoreaction.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of Ag-BaTiO3 nanotube arrays

3.1.1 
            SEM analysis. 

Fig. 1(a,b) shows SEM images of BaTiO3 NTAs prepared by the hydrothermal method at 150 °C for 2 h. Fig. 1(a) shows that the as-prepared BaTiO3 NTAs have a special and interesting surface morphology similar to many flowers seen from a distance. But the magnified morphology (Fig. 1b) is similar to red coral. BaTiO3 nanotubes with approximately 100 nm in diameter can be obtained.

The SEM images of Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs prepared by two different methods are shown in Fig.1(c,d) and Fig.1(e,f), respectively. Fig. 1(d) and Fig. 1(f) show magnified images of the top-surface corresponding to Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 1(e). As shown in Fig. 1(d), the dispersed Ag nanoparticles with diameters of 5–10 nm on the sample surface are obtained directly by the photodeposition approach. Compared with SEM imagesFig. 1(c,d) and Fig. 1(e,f), it is clear that Ag contents on BaTiO3 NTAs are obviously different. Although the concentration of AgNO3 used in the first method is the same as that in the second, the loading density of Ag nanoparticles is lower. It indicates that the photochemical approach is more favored for loading Ag nanoparticles than the direct photodeposition approach. Moreover, it is apparent that the diameter of Ag particles is about 20–35 nm, much bigger than that prepared by the direct photodeposition approach. It may be the conglomeration of Ag nanoparticles at the top of the nanotubes. In addition, it can be seen that the diameter of Ag-BaTiO3 nanotubes is smaller, and the nanotube wall becomes thicker than that prepared by the photochemical approach. It shows that many Ag nanoparticles were loaded on the nanotube inwall. Moreover, it can also be seen that some Ag nanoparticles reside within the nanotubes from the SEM images.


3.1.2 
            TEM analysis. 
The microstructure of Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs was further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM image of Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs is shown in Fig. 2(a). It is clearly observed that BaTiO3 nanotubular structures are formed and Ag nanoparticles are dispersed on the surface of BaTiO3 nanotubes. Particle size distribution of silver is in the range from 20 nm to 35 nm by the TEM image analysis. To further obtain more structural information on BaTiO3 nanotubes and Ag nanoparticles, HRTEM was performed. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the estimated interplanar spacing of BaTiO3 nanotubes and Ag nanoparticles is 0.28 nm and 0.24 nm, which corresponds to the [110] crystal direction of cubic BaTiO3 and the [111] crystal direction of cubic Ag, respectively. The d spacing value for Ag nanoparticles indicates that the loaded Ag exists in the form of a metal. This result can be confirmed by following XRD and XPS analysis.

3.1.3 
            XRD analysis. 

Fig. 3(a) shows the XRD pattern of BaTiO3 NTAs. The sample can be indexed with cubic (JCPDF 31-0174) BaTiO3 structures.
 Fig. 3  
XRD spectra of (a) BaTiO3 NTAs and (b,c) Ag-loaded BaTiO3 NTAs obtained by photochemical approach in 0.5 M AgNO3 before and after degradation, respectively. 
The sample has a pure phase without unreacted TiO2. It is obvious that the crystalline BaTiO3 nanotubes can be successfully formed from amorphous TiO2 after the hydrothermal treatment at low temperature. Fig. 3(b) shows the XRD pattern of Ag-loaded BaTiO3 NTAs. All diffraction peaks of BaTiO3 NTAs are also observed. Moreover, the major diffraction peak of Ag nanoparticles can also be observed, the diffraction peak (2θ = 38.10°) assigned to cubic (JCPDF 03-0921) Ag0 is displayed in the sample of Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs irradiated by UV for 1 h, which proves that the BaTiO3 nanotube surface is loaded with Ag nanoparticles. The XRD pattern of Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs obtained after photodegradation is shown in Fig. 3(c). Compared with Fig. 3(b), there is no obvious change in intensity and peak position. This indicates that Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs photocatalysts are essentially stable.


3.1.4 
            XPS analysis. 
To affirm the metallic state of silver on the surface of BaTiO3 NTAs, Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs were further characterized by XPS measurements. Fig. 4 shows XPS measurements for Ti 2p and Ag 3d for Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs. Seen from Fig. 4(a), the Ti structure consists of two peaks at the surface. Peaks located at 458.8 and 464.4 eV in Fig. 4(a) account for Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively, and coincide with other researchers' work on Ti 2p XPS for BaTiO3 and SrTiO331 with Ti4+ ion profile. The difference between Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 orbit-spin splitting binding energies is 5.6 eV in the Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs. This value is in agreement with that of BaTiO3 (5.6 eV).32

Fig. 4(b) shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ag 3d region of the sample Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs. Fig. 4(b) is made up of a doublet with 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 signals at 367.89 and 373.89 eV, respectively, corresponding to the normal XPS spectra of Ag metal. The spin–orbit splitting energy of the 3d doublet is 6.0 eV. The difference of binding energies indicates that silver mainly exists in the Ag0 state on the BaTiO3 nanotube surface,33,34 in agreement with the XRD results.


3.1.5 
            UV-vis
diffuse reflectance spectra
          . 

Fig. 5 shows UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of unmodified BaTiO3 NTAs and Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs. It can be seen that Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs exhibit strong absorption in the visible region. This may be ascribed to the surface plasmon absorption of silver nanoparticles. This is an indication of the presence of Ag0 nanoparticles on the surface of BaTiO3 NTAs. In addition, the surface plasmon absorption band of Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs is slightly red-shifted and broadened with the increase of AgNO3 concentration which suggests that Ag nanoparticle size distribution become wide. The plasmon absorption peak is seen at 420 nm for Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs obtained in 0.5 M AgNO3. The surface plasmon absorption can assist the photocatalytic process by thermal catalysis and surface plasmon resonance (SPR).35 This is due to the SPR effect in metallic Ag nanoparticles is considered to locally enhance the electric field, which facilitates electron-hole production, and also increase the adsorption of polar molecules.36–38 Therefore, the photocatalytic activity of BaTiO3 NTAs can be enhanced by loading Ag nanoparticles.

3.2. Photocatalytic activity and mechanism analysis

3.2.1. Effect of pH on degradation rate. 
Photocatalytic decomposition of methyl orange (MO) was used to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of the prepared Ag-BaTiO3 nanotube array films. The degradation ratio and pH of MO solution were determined by a UV-vis spectrophotometer and pH meter, respectively. Effect of pH on MO degradation was first investigated. So, the maximum absorption wavelength of MO at various pH values was tested. Absorption spectra of MO in water were obtained at 250–600 nm against blank solution, as shown in Fig. 6(a). The results indicate that the maximum absorption wavelengths of MO at different pH conditions are different. The maximum adsorption peak is located at 464 nm and 508 nm at pH 7 and pH 3, respectively.
 Fig. 6  
UV-vis spectra of original methyl orange solution at various pH conditions (a), and photocatalytic degradation rates of MO at various pH conditions for Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs obtained by photochemical approach in 0.5 M AgNO3 (b). 

Fig. 6(b) shows the evolution of MO conversion with time over Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs at various pH values. In this work, HCl and NaOH were used to adjust the MO solution pH in the range of 3–11. It is observed from Fig. 6(b) that the pH value of MO has a significant effect on the degradation rate. The degradation rates at various pH values all increase along with increasing the irradiation time. With increasing pH, the percentage of degradation decreases and then increases. Moreover, it is noticed that the degradation rate under acidic conditions can be higher than that under basic or neutral conditions after irradiation for 1 h. The degradation ratio appears the lowest in neutral solution. The effect of pH on the degradation of the organic pollutants is variable and controversial.39 The possible explanation for these results is that at low pH values, the surface of the BaTiO3 photocatalyst is positively charged, while MO is negatively charged. Therefore, a strong adsorption of MO on BaTiO3 can occur due to the electrostatic attraction. However, at high pH values, hydroxyl radicals are considered as the predominant species with high oxidation capability.40–42 The optimal pH value for this photocatalytic reaction system is 3, so the absorbance at 508 nm was used to examine the degradation of MO solution.


3.2.2. Effect of AgNO3 concentration on degradation ratio. 
The photocatalytic decomposition of MO was studied by varying the AgNO3 concentration from 0.1 to 1.0 M when Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs were prepared by the photochemical approach. In addition, the photocatalytic activities of Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs prepared by two different deposition approaches were also compared. The results indicate that Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs obtained by the photochemical approach show a higher photocatalytic activity compared with that obtained by the photodeposition approach as shown in Fig.7a. For comparison, the decoloration of pure BaTiO3 NTAs is given as well. From Fig. 7(a) it can be seen that silver-modified BaTiO3 NTAs have a much higher photocatalytic degradation rate than that of pure BaTiO3 NTAs. The plot of ln(C0/C) versus irradiation time t is shown in Fig. 7a. The k values for pure BaTiO3 NTAs and Ag modified BaTiO3 NTAs are found to be 2.73 and 4.24 h−1, indicating a substantial improvement of the photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the decomposition of MO increases with increasing AgNO3 concentration, reaching a maximum at 0.5 M, and then decreases with further increase in AgNO3 concentration. Thus, the optimum AgNO3 concentration is 0.5 M. At this loading amount, MO removal rate is about 98.53% after 60 min of UV irradiation. The absorption at a wavelength of 508 nm obviously decreases with irradiation time, indicating the photodecomposition of methyl orange, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The enhanced activity of Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs is due to the fact that when coupling metallic Ag with BaTiO3 nanotubes, a Schottky barrier is formed between Ag nanoparticles and BaTiO3 nanotubes leading to charge separation.43,44Fig. 8 shows a schematic diagram of photocatalytic degradation MO over Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs. The photogenerated electrons flow toward metallic Ag and accumulate on the surface of Ag by a conduction band, and can be transferred to oxygen adsorbed on the surface of Ag rapidly to produce free oxygen radicals, such as O2˙−, OH˙, HO2−, etc. Moreover, photogenerated holes produce OH˙ radicals which oxidize the MO molecular adsorbed on the surface of Ag-BaTiO3 NTAs. Ag, acting as photogenerated electron traps, accelerates the rate of electron transferring to molecular oxygen, and inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.45,46 Therefore, this leads to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of Ag-BaTiO3 nanotube array composite films. However, with the increase of AgNO3 concentration, the amount of Ag nanoparticles increases, which causes the growth of silver clusters and thereby decreasing the active sites for the photocatalytic reaction. Moreover, superfluous Ag nanoparticles would hinder light absorption and the contact between BaTiO3 nanotubes and organic molecules,43 which lowers the efficiency of photocatalytic reaction.

4. Conclusions

        Ag loaded flower-like BaTiO3 NTAs can be prepared by hydrothermal treatment of TiO2 nanotube arrays and barium hydroxide in CO2-free deionized water followed by the photo-reduction of Ag nanoparticles on BaTiO3 NTAs. The photocatalytic degradation of MO activity of BaTiO3 NTAs can be enhanced by loading Ag. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity depends on the concentration of AgNO3 dipping solution and the pH of MO solution. The Ag loaded flower-like BaTiO3 NTAs are also of great interest for solar cells, photonic and optoelectronic devices, catalysis and nanotechnology.
