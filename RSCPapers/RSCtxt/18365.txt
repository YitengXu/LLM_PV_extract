The ultrahigh on/off ratio of 105 is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the device without the ligand treatment. Moreover, the responsivity increases from ∼2.2 A W−1 to ∼24.5 A W−1 and the detectivity from 3.5 × 1012 Jones to 8.9 × 1013 Jones. To gain further insight into the effect of ligand-exchange by bifunctional linker molecules besides surface passivation, we divide the electron transfer process into two parts, the electron transfer from quantum dots (QDs) to the linker and from the linker to TiO2. Injection of photoexcited electrons from colloidal CsPbBr3 QDs into TiO2 nanoparticles by bifunctional linker molecules is found to be much faster. Continuous-wave and time-resolved fluorescence spectra exhibit strong quenching for CsPbBr3 QDs assembled by the linker or coupled to TiO2 nanoparticles, which is consistent with electron transfer for QDs. From the results of the transient absorption measurement and fluorescence lifetime, the electron transfer time of QDs–TiO2 linked by the bifunctional molecules is calculated to be within 40 ns, while that from QDs to TiO2 particles directly is estimated to be ∼290 ns. This indicates that much faster electron injection occurs under the effect of the electron linker. In addition, the linker molecule modification can improve the adsorption of mp-TiO2 to capture more QDs.
Introduction
In recent years, lead halide semiconductors with perovskite crystal structures, primarily, hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, or I, or mixed Cl/Br and Br/I systems), have attracted tremendous attention, due to their outstanding optoelectronic characteristics. CH3NH3PbX3 perovskite materials have been widely used in solar cells with certified power conversion efficiencies of over 20%,1,2 in highly sensitive photodetectors,3–5 high performance light emitting diodes (LED),6,7 X-ray detectors8 and lasers.9
Unsurprisingly, the research interest in lead halide perovskite focuses not only on polycrystalline films, microcrystals and bulk monocrystals,1–9 but also on low dimensional structures10 such as one-dimensional (1D) nanowires,11–13 two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets14,15 and quantum dots (QDs),16–18 which may have superior or unique optical and electrical properties. Most studies in the last two years have focused on colloidal CH3NH3PbX3 QDs due to their unique optical properties, such as size-dependent emission wavelength, narrow emission spectrum and high luminescence efficiency.19–21 At the same time, fully inorganic cesium-based perovskite (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, or I) QDs have also received great attention. Compared to hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites, all-inorganic perovskites exhibit higher stability and have huge potential in various optoelectronic devices,17,22 and should be more suitable for application in solar cells.23 A typical strategy to construct solar cells based on QDs is to use semiconductor QDs as the sensitizer in porous metal oxide nanostructure films, in analogy to dye-sensitized films.24 As for photodetectors, a prevailing method is to make semiconductor QDs form a uniform film and work as the bulk semiconductor in a single solution-processing step.25 Furthermore, an alternative strategy to fabricate photodetectors, or phototransistors,26,27 is to use semiconductor QDs as the sensitizer in porous metal oxide nanostructure films.28 Sensitization of mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) films using classical chalcogenide QDs29,30 and CsPbBr3 QDs28 has been reported, and charge transfer from the QDs into the TiO2 film has been demonstrated via several types of measurements. Although successful incorporation of pure QDs into mp-TiO2 is inspiring, this approach is not optimal. In order to improve the electron transfer from the QDs to TiO2, introducing a ligand exchange process should be considered seriously.31,32
Here, we use a modified facile one-pot colloidal synthesis, as reported by Protesescu et al.,16 for preparation of inorganic cesium-based perovskite (CsPbX3) QDs. Compared to the classical chalcogenide QDs, CsPbX3 QDs are more ionic in nature33 and the interactions with capping ligands are also more ionic and labile.34 Hence, we use a post-synthetic ligand exchange to replace the alkylammonium ligand with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) which is a bifunctional linker molecule with carboxylate and thiol functional groups (SH-R-COOH). CsPbBr3 QDs are attached to TiO2 nanoparticles through bifunctional linker molecules. The thiol groups interact with CsPbBr3 QDs while carboxylic groups react with hydroxyl group on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles. Then we fabricated a MSM photodetector with MPA, as shown in Fig. 1. It was proved that the photodetector with MPA was, as expected, much superior to the device without MPA. The high on/off ratio of 105 was two orders of magnitude higher than that of the device without MPA. Moreover, the responsivity increased from ∼2.2 A W−1 to ∼24.5 A W−1 and the detectivity from 3.5 × 1012 Jones to 8.9 × 1013 Jones. However, as we all know, the effect of a ligand-exchange process on QD optoelectronic devices is attributed to surface passivation35,36 or replacing an insulating ligand,26 such as oleic acid, in general. Here, we want to offer a different perspective about the impact of the ligand exchange process on QDs. That is the electron injection rate influenced by ligand exchange. Then we divide the electron transfer process into two parts, the electron transfer from QDs to MPA and from MPA to TiO2, to gain further insight into the effect of MPA and how it works on the photodetector. Continuous-wave and time-resolved fluorescence spectra exhibit strong quenching for CsPbBr3 QDs. From the results of the transient absorption measurement and fluorescence lifetime, we can conclude that the electron transfer time from CsPbBr3 QDs to MPA is within 25 ns and that from the MPA to TiO2 nanoparticles is within 16 ns. This means the total electron transfer time (41 ns) of QDs–TiO2 linked by MPA is much shorter than that from QDs to TiO2 particles directly, which is estimated as ∼290 ns. This means much faster electron injection occurred for the photodetector after the ligand exchange process and the rate of electron injection plays an importance role in photoresponse.

Results and discussion
Characteristics of the CsPbX3 QDs
We have synthesized a series of QD samples with different halide compositions. As shown in Fig. 2a–c, the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images reveal that the CsPbX3 QDs with a cubic structure have sharp lattice fringes and high crystalline quality. The UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra are presented in Fig. 2d. The as-synthesized CsPbX3 QDs have absorbance edges at around 412, 522 and 700 nm, corresponding to band gaps of 3.01, 2.38 and 1.77 eV, and emission peaks at 409, 520 and 692 nm with full width at half-maximum (FWHM) around 13, 18 and 32 nm for X = Cl, Br and I respectively, which are consistent with the reported values.16 Time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay spectra of the CsPbX3 QD solution are shown in Fig. 2e. Fitting the data with multi-exponential decay curves yields three time constants, τ1, τ2, τ3, and τave, as summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The average lifetimes of CsPbX3 QDs are 12.73, 68.68 and 192.9 ns respectively, which means the heavier halogen based perovskite QDs possess longer average lifetimes under the same conditions. And Fig. S1 (see the ESI†) shows a schematic of the cubic perovskite lattice structure of CsPbX3 QDs. As CsPbBr3 QDs have a negligible influence of surface defects on trapping charge carriers37 and ultrafast exciton dynamics38 with interfacial charge-transfer among CsPbX3 QDs, we focus our systematic investigation on CsPbBr3 QDs. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the CsPbBr3 QDs was obtained, and the characteristic peaks correspond to the cubic structure (PDF#54-0752), which is consistent with the HRTEM (Fig. 2b) observation.

Characteristics of the photodetector with or without MPA
Then we fabricated the metal/semiconductor/metal (MSM) photodetectors28 with MPA, as shown in Fig. 1. There are several significant figure-of-merit parameters for evaluating the properties of photodetectors, such as the on/off ratio, responsivity (R), and detectivity (D*) (see the Experimental section), although the primary parameter to be considered may be different depending on the application. Fig. 3a shows the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics measured in the dark and under illumination with λ = 405 nm (power density = 0.1 mW cm−2). The dark current of the photodetector with MPA is much lower than that of the photodetector without MPA, and its photocurrent is much higher than that of the latter. The lower dark current should be attributed to the passivation of TiO242 by MPA, and the higher photocurrent should be attributed to the more number of QDs capped on mp-TiO2. The corresponding on/off ratios of the devices at different biases show that the introduction of MPA into the photodetector improved the on/off ratio by about two orders of magnitude under the applied bias voltage of 0.2–8 V, as shown in Fig. 3b. The wavelength-dependent photoresponsivity of the photodetectors measured at 2 V is plotted in Fig. 3c. The photoresponse curves of both the photodetectors with and without MPA show good agreement with the absorption spectra, and the responsivity increased from ∼2.2 A W−1 to ∼24.5 A W−1 because of the effects of MPA. For the detectivity, it can be expressed as D* = R(2qJd)−1/2, where R is the responsivity, q is the elementary charge, and Jd is the dark current density when the dark current is dominated by the shot noise.43 The detectivities of the photodetector with or without MPA at 405 nm (0.1 mW cm−2) under an applied bias voltage of 2 V were then calculated to be 8.9 × 1013 and 3.5 × 1012 Jones, respectively. The time response behaviors of the photodetectors are shown in Fig. 3d, from which the rise and fall times were calculated to be 4.7 s and 2.3 s, respectively. It can be seen that both the photodetectors switch slowly compared to other lateral-structure photodetectors.44–46 As a result, the photodetector with MPA exhibits much better performance. To gain further insight into the effect of ligand-exchange by bifunctional linker molecules besides surface passivation, we divide the electron transfer process into two parts, the electron transfer from quantum dots (QDs) to the linker and from the linker to TiO2.

In addition, many works have been reported on photoconductive devices based on varied configurations and material morphologies including nanoparticles, nanosheets and single crystals of CsPbBr3 perovskites. Some of them exhibit good performances with regard to responsivity, rise/decay time, on/off ratio and detectivity as shown in Table 1. We can see that except for the device based on CsPbBr3 nanosheets/CNT composites, the as-fabricated device shows the highest responsivity.

Characteristics of the CsPbBr3 QDs with MPA solution
We first investigated the characteristics of CsPbBr3 QDs assembled with MPA, a bifunctional linker molecule, before we began to study the properties of CsPbBr3 QDs linked to TiO2 nanoparticles by MPA. The reduction potentials for MPA molecules are reported to be ∼4.06 V47,48versus vacuum, corresponding to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of MPA between the conduction band (CB) of CsPbBr3 QDs (at ∼−3.6 eV) and the CB of TiO2 (at ∼−4.1 eV). MPA is suitable for the ligand exchange process. The optical absorption and PL spectra of the QDs with or without MPA are shown in Fig. 4a. The absorbance increases slightly in the whole absorption region, while the QD solution added with a trace amount of MPA rapidly changes from bright green to dull yellow (see the inset in Fig. 4a). And the QD fluorescence is quenched dramatically in the presence of MPA. The strong fluorescence quenching is a signature of excited electron transfer to MPA. In addition, the emission peak has shifted to the blue by 14 meV and becomes slightly narrower when the alkylammonium ligand (oleylamine), which binds to the surface bromide, presumably through a hydrogen bridge or otherwise through electrostatic interactions,34 is replaced with MPA which is a much shorter ligand. Another ligand existing in the CsPbBr3 QDs is a carboxylate ligand (oleic acid).49 The spectral blue shift may originate from the redistribution of electronic density and enhancement of electron confinement after the ligand exchange. In fact, the absorption is red-shifted and PL is blue-shifted slightly after the MPA treatment. This means the Stokes shift of CsPbBr3 QDs is decreased due to the MPA treatment, which may originate from the lower energy state electron transfer (for a detailed explanation see the ESI†). TRPL spectra allow monitoring of the dynamics of the electron population in the QDs and provide further evidence for electron transfer. The TRPL spectra were measured by monitoring the peak emission at 520 nm, as shown in Fig. 4b. Fitting the data with a multi-exponential decay curve yields three time constants, τ1, τ2, τ3, and τave, as summarized in Table 2. We can assume that electrons in the QDs decay only by radiative relaxation or by transfer through MPA. The electron-transfer rate constant should be ket = 1/τave-(QDs+MPA) − 1/τave-QDs.50 Using the values from Table 2, the electron-transfer rate constant is estimated to be 41.94 μs−1, which corresponds to an electron injection time of 23.84 ns.

In order to further investigate the charge transfer, time-resolved transient absorption (TA) measurements51 were performed at room temperature with CsPbBr3 QD n-hexane solution and a solution with a drop of MPA (Fig. 5). A pump pulse laser at 355 nm was used to excite the CsPbBr3 QDs and the induced absorption changes (ΔA), as functions of both wavelength and time, were recorded using a white light continuum probe pulse variably delayed with respect to the pump pulse. The TA spectra in Fig. 5a show strong bleaching (negative signal) associated with the strong S1 ← S0 ground-state bleach (GSB) superimposed by the stimulated emission (SE) S1 → S0 contribution to the low energy side. These two contributions merge to a strong negative signal with a minimum at 515 nm. But at 300–800 nm a distinct (positive signal) excited state absorption (ESA) band is not observed by nanosecond-spectroscopy. The TA spectra of CsPbBr3 QDs–MPA complexes at indicated delays from 7 ns to 18 ns are shown in Fig. 5b and delays after 24 ns are shown in Fig. 5c. Compared with free QDs, the sustaining time of the GSB (with SE) in QDs–MPA complexes was shorter, indicating electron transfer from the CB of CsPbBr3 QDs to MPA. In both Fig. 5a and b, we observed two bleaching bands peaking at 515 nm and 420 nm respectively. The TA spectra are dominated by the 515 nm bleach peak for free QDs but not for QDs–MPA complexes. The suppressed bleach peak at 515 nm of QDs–MPA complexes can be explained by the quenching of SE due to electron transfer to MPA, just like fluorescence quenching in Fig. 4a. This observation indicates that SE from S1 to S0 has taken place in competition with energy (electron) transfer to MPA. The transient bleaching observed at these early times further reflects the charge separation achieved in the CsPbBr3 QDs. The origin of the first negative signal peak (420 nm) is discussed in the ESI† (Fig. S4).52 And we observed that ESA appeared after 39 ns in Fig. 5c, which has a lifetime of over 100 ns. This means that a long-lived molecular state appeared after excitation of the CsPbBr3 QDs–MPA system. Clearly, there are two prominent ESA bands with peaks at about 690 nm and below 300 nm. And the TA spectra in Fig. 5c also display a dip at about 500 nm that originates from a GSB (with SE) of the QDs superimposed on the ESA of the long-lived molecular state (M*). Fig. 5d shows the kinetic trace recorded at 420 nm, 515 nm and 690 nm, corresponding to the peaks of the QD GSB (with SE) and the maximum of M* ESA. The negative (bleach) signal appeared in the first 25 ns and was subsequently superseded by a positive (ESA) signal. This observation implies that the electron transfer from CsPbBr3 QDs to MPA effectively occurs in 25 ns, which is consistent with the results of fluorescence lifetime. The transient absorption kinetics is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), and the corresponding multi-exponential fitting values to the kinetics can be seen in Table S2 (ESI†).

The multi-exponential fitting values to the kinetics are given in Table S2 (ESI†). The excitation wavelength for all TA spectra was 355 nm; concentration: 10−4–10−5. 
Characteristics of the CsPbBr3 QDs linked to TiO2 nanoparticles by MPA
We can conclude that the electron transfer time from CsPbBr3 QDs to MPA is within 25 ns from the results of the transient absorption measurement and fluorescence lifetime. As for the electron transfer from MPA to the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 nanoparticles, it is confirmed by other different kinds of QDs, such as PbS QDs,32 CdSe QDs,31,53 and PbS-CdS QDs.54 Then we investigate the effect of MPA working as a linker between the QDs and mp-TiO2. The absorption spectra of QDs on the mp-TiO2 film with or without MPA are shown in Fig. 6a and their PL spectra including the PL of the pure QD film are displayed in Fig. 6b. The enhanced absorption indicates that the MPA modification can improve the adsorption of mp-TiO2 to capture much more QDs. The QD fluorescence is quenched dramatically in the presence of TiO2 with or without MPA. And the fluorescence quenching of QDs with MPA would be more significant despite the increased absorbance of the composite linked by MPA. In addition, the emission peaks show blue-shift, which may originate from the redistribution of electronic density and enhancement of electron confinement after contacting TiO2 for the black line28 and ligand exchange for the red line. The corresponding PL parameters are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†) and PL mappings of QDs on mp-TiO2 films with or without MPA are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Like previous TRPL characteristics of the QD solution, TRPL spectra allow monitoring of the dynamics of the electron population in the QDs and provide further evidence for electron transfer that occurred in the QDs–TiO2 or QDs–MPA–TiO2 system. As shown in Fig. 6c and d, fitting the data with a multi-exponential decay curve yields three time constants, τ1, τ2, τ3, and τave, as summarized in Table 3. Using the values from Table 3, the electron-transfer rate constant of the QDs–TiO2 system is estimated to be 3.58 μs−1, which corresponds to an electron injection time of 279.09 ns. And in the QDs–MPA–TiO2 system, we can divide the electron transfer process into two parts, the electron transfer from QDs to MPA and from MPA to TiO2. For the first part, the result of electron injection time obtained from the previous discussion about QD solutions is 23.84 ns. For the second part, the electron injection time from MPA to TiO2 is estimated to be 29.54 ns by using the values from Table 3. Therefore, the electron-transfer rate constant of the QDs–MPA–TiO2 system is estimated to be 18.73 μs−1, which corresponds to an electron injection time of 53.38 ns. The electron injection time of the complete process, from QDs to TiO2 through MPA, can also be estimated by using the values from Table 3 directly. The electron injection time is 39.94 ns for the QDs–MPA–TiO2 system.

We conclude that the electron injection time from MPA to TiO2 is overestimated due to the slow process taking place in the QDs–MPA–TiO2 system, the electron injection from QDs to TiO2 directly. So the electron injection time from MPA to TiO2 should be less than 16 ns. Then, the energy (electron) transfer pathways in the QDs–MPA–TiO2 system are summarized with the part of the kinetic scheme in Scheme 1. Note that this scheme is simplified. We demonstrate that the electron transfer time of QDs–TiO2 linked by MPA will be much shorter than that from QDs to TiO2 particles directly, as summarized in Scheme 1. The much faster electron transfer will bring about collection of more electrons before radiative or non-radiative recombination and result in much superior performance of the photodetector.

In order to clarify the surface morphology of the prepared mp-TiO2 films coated with MPA, CsPbBr3 QDs or both, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed (Fig. 7). The root-mean square (RMS) roughness of the uncoated mp-TiO2 film and the mp-TiO2 films coated with CsPbBr3 QDs, MPA and both are 9.17, 9.71, 10.5 and 11.4 nm, respectively (Table 4 and Fig. S6, ESI†). When the mp-TiO2 film was coated with QDs directly (Fig. 7b), the surface morphology is essentially identical to that of the mp-TiO2 film, but changed obviously when the mp-TiO2 film was modified by MPA. As shown in Fig. 7c, when the mp-TiO2 films were coated with MPA, the carboxylic acid moiety of MPA strongly interacts with the positively charged surface of mp-TiO2 as the hydrolysis-condensation reaction took place. The outward thiol groups of the MPA capped TiO2 nanoparticles increased the RMS roughness. And the outward thiol groups of MPA would increase the loading amounts of CsPbBr3 QDs by coupling, which resulted in a further increase in the RMS roughness (Fig. 7d).

Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated photodetectors (or phototransistor) with or without MPA. The photodetectors employing MPA exhibited significantly enhanced performance compared to those without MPA. Such photodetectors demonstrated significantly improved on/off ratio by about two orders of magnitude. At the same time, the photoresponsivity was about 10 times larger than that of the device without MPA and the detectivity was about 25 times larger. To further illustrate the effect of ligand-exchange by bifunctional linker molecules besides surface passivation, we divided the electron transfer process into two parts, the electron transfer from QDs to MPA and from MPA to TiO2. Then we used a post-synthetic ligand exchange to replace the alkylammonium ligand of CsPbBr3 QDs with MPA. Continuous-wave and time-resolved fluorescence spectra exhibited strong quenching for CsPbBr3 QD, and this was clear evidence for rapid electron transfer from the QDs to the TiO2 nanoparticles. From the results of the transient absorption measurement and fluorescence lifetime, we could conclude that the electron transfer time of QDs–TiO2 linked by MPA was much shorter than that from QDs to TiO2 particles directly. These results indicated that electron injection from colloidal CsPbBr3 QDs into TiO2 nanoparticles by bifunctional linker molecules was much faster and more effective than that from QDs into TiO2 nanoparticles directly. And the rate of electron injection plays an important role in photoresponse. In addition, the MPA modification could improve the adsorption of mp-TiO2 to capture more QDs. Besides in photodetectors, the bifunctional linker molecules, working as electron linkers, also could be used in other optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells.55 These remarkable results would lead to potential promising applications in integrated photonics and optoelectronic devices and systems.
Method
Materials preparation
All the reagents were purchased from Aladdin or Alfa Aesar and were used directly without further purification unless noted otherwise. As reported by Protesescu et al.,16 Cs2CO3 (0.814 g) was loaded into a 250 mL 3-necked flask along with octadecene (ODE, 40 mL) and oleic acid (OA, 2.5 mL), dried for 1 h at 140 °C, and then heated under N2 to 200 °C until all the Cs2CO3 reacted with OA. Then a Cs-oleate precursor solution was prepared. Because Cs-oleate precipitates out of ODE at room temperature easily, the precursor solution was preheated to 100 °C before injection. ODE (5 mL), oleylamine (OAm, 0.5 mL), dried OA (0.5 mL), and PbX2 (0.18 mmol) were loaded into a 250 mL 3-necked flask and the temperature was increased to 120 °C under N2. After complete solubilization of the PbX2 salt, the temperature was increased to 180 °C and a Cs-oleate solution (0.4 mL, 0.125 M in ODE, prepared as described above and preheated before injection) was quickly injected, and 5 s later, the reaction mixture was cooled using an ice-water bath. After centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded and the particles were re-dispersed in n-hexane forming stable solutions of colloidal CsPbX3 QDs.
Device fabrication
The glass substrates were cleaned successively using acetone, isopropanol, and de-ionized water. The planar interdigitated Ti/Au (50/200 nm) electrodes were fabricated using standard photolithography to pattern the photoresist for subsequent metallization and lift-off. We defined the channel length as 10 μm, while the finger widths and the channel widths were 10 μm and 2 mm, respectively. Then, the mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) was deposited on top of the substrate by spin-coating TiO2 paste (Dyesol 18NR-T), which was diluted 4 times by absolute ethyl alcohol, at a rate of 2000 rpm for 30 s. The layer was then sintered in air at 500 °C for 30 min. The thicknesses of the mp-TiO2 films were controlled to ∼200 nm. The pure MPA was deposited on the sintered mp-TiO2 films by spin-coating (2000 rpm, 30 s) and placed for about 4 h. Then the remnant MPA was washed with pure 2-propanol. The above CsPbBr3 QD solution (∼1 mg mL−1) was deposited on the glass substrate (2000 rpm, 10 s) by spin-coating (2 times) and finally washed with pure 2-propanol (2000 rpm, 10 s).
Characterization
The UV-vis spectra of the nanocrystal solution were collected using a Shimadzu UV3600PLUS UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer over an excitation range of 400–600 nm, at 0.5 nm intervals. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved PL decay spectra were measured using an Edinburgh Instruments (EI) FLS980 lifetime and steady state spectrometer. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) of the nanocrystals of the CsPbBr3 perovskites was performed using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN field emission transmission electron microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the perovskite nanocrystal powder were performed using a BRUKER, AXS D8 ADVANCE X-ray powder diffractometer using monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Film morphologies of the mp-TiO2 films were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FEI, Nova NanoSEM650). Transient absorption measurements were performed using a Laser Flash Photolysis Spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, LP920). The current–voltage characteristics and time response of the perovskite devices were recorded using a semiconductor device analyzer (Agilent B1500A, USA). A 0.1 mW cm−2 laser (λ = 405 nm) was used as the light source for the photovoltaic (I–V) and time response measurements. The scan direction was reverse and the scan rate was 0.04 V per point. Photoresponsivity (R) was calculated by measuring the photocurrent Iph and dividing this value by the incident power Pinc, such that R = Iph/Pinc. The spectral photocurrent was measured using a Stanford Research Systems SR830 lock-in amplifier. The monochromatic illumination was provided by a monochromator (Zolix, Omni-λ500) supplied with a tungsten-halogen light source (Zolix, LSH-T150). The light intensities (Pinc) of the different wavelengths were measured using a photodiode power sensor (Thorlabs, S130VC). The light excitation was chopped at a frequency of 180 Hz. The device was biased using a Keithley 2611A system source meter. The detector was kept in a dark, shielded environment. And all characterization studies were performed in air at room temperature. Detectivity can be expressed as D* = R(2qJd)−1/2, where R is the responsivity, q is the elementary charge, and Jd is the dark current density.
