    , Accepted 10th March 2011First published on 9th April 2011AbstractIn this article, we introduce a novel two-dimensional (2D) functional Co3O4 nanostructure, “nanomesh”, which possesses the highest surface area (382 m2 g−1) as compared to the other Co3O4 nanostructures, well-crystallized features, thickness of no more than 10 nm and a void space diameter below 6.0 nm. These structural characteristics of the nanomesh are well-suited for lithium-ion battery (LIBs) applications. In initial tests, high specific capacity (1800 mAh/g), good rate capability (above 380 mAh/g at a discharging rate of 1000 mA g−1 over 50 cycles) and stable cyclability (up to 100 cycles) have been demonstrated. In addition, the dominant (12) crystal plane in the nanomesh has much higher surface energy than the conventional (111) and (100) crystal planes, leading to higher activity in supercapacitors. The Co3O4 nanomesh demonstrated in this research could be successfully utilized in energy and environmental applications, such as selective catalysis, gene delivery and gas or biological sensing, besides the application in electrochemical energy storage shown in this work. More importantly, the synthesis strategy used in this research can possibly be extended to other material systems as a general approach to fabricate 2D mesoporous oxides.

Broader context
Electrochemical energy storage is more and more important in today's information-rich and mobile society, especially with the fossil sources gradually running out. Together with other power deliverable devices, e.g. solar cells, fuel cells, electrochemical energy storage will be crucial in solving the urgent problems involving energy and environmental sciences in the near future. For this topic, the great challenge is how to rationally design and fabricate functional materials to significantly enhance the related performances. Herein, a new two-dimensional (2D) Co3O4 nanostructure, denoted as nanomesh, is for the first time synthesized and applied in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as superior anode, exhibiting very high capacity of 1800 mAh/g and improved rate capability, even in supercapacitors (SCs). All enhanced performances are derived from the unique morphological and structural properties in Co3O4 nanomesh, where a display of a high energy crystal plane, mesoporosity and single crystallinity is available. The synthesis strategy is also extendable to other materials' preparation and will open up a new gateway for applications in energy and environmental sciences, including selective catalysis, energy conversion and storage, biotechnology.

Introduction
Nanofabrication of low-dimensional materials in a controlled manner has always been a great challenge since nanotechnology has been recognized to enable enhanced performance in electronics, catalysis, bioscience, energy related areas, etc.1–3 The reason for that can be unambiguously ascribed to the fact that the properties or performances in devices are strictly dependent on their components' morphologies, structural dimensions and chemical compositions.4 Overall, more research attention has been paid to one-dimensional (1-D) nanoscale materials compared to the efforts in other dimensions in the nanoscale. Over the past few years, the situation has changed a little because of the magnificent development on the two-dimensional (2-D) nanomaterial of graphene, which is considered a promising candidate for practical applications in electronics, but unfortunately not for field-effect transistors operating at room temperature due to its semi-metallic property with a zero bandgap.5 Very recently, Huang and Duan opened up the bandgap in the graphene layer by fabricating a kind of nanomesh with tunable periodicities and neck widths using the block copolymer lithography technique and launched the first room temperature graphene field-effect transistors, clearly showcasing the power of nanostructure engineering in controlling the material and device properties.6 Additionally, as previously reported, 2-D nanoscale membranes with regularly dispersed holes play important roles in photonic crystals,7 luminescence,4 templated milling,8 bio- or gas sensing9 and information industry,10 where anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) is often utilized as a sacrificial template to generate periodic patterns,9 such as zinc aluminate11 and zinc oxide nanonets.4 Making use of the periodic crystal mismatch between the substrate and growing membrane, BN nanomesh could be obtained as well;12 however, no free-standing architecture was achievable in that case. Normally the templates from which the patterned membranes are derived have to be removed after fabrication, which will definitely add process complexity, lower yield, and increase the cost. To address these process inadequacies of template-assisted or lithography methods, there is great interest in developing cost-effective, productive, facile and more direct approaches for free-standing membranes with a high density dispersion of holes, especially when the dimensions of the holes are in the order of several nanometres.
Experimental details
Materials
All chemicals or materials were used directly without any further purification prior to use. Ethylene glycol (Fisher Chemical, 99.99%), ammonium hydroxide (NH3·H2O, 28–30 wt%, J.T.Baker), cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)2, 99.9%, Aldrich), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, 99.9%, Aldrich), titanium foil (0.127 mm (0.005 inch) thick, annealed, 99%, Alfa Aesar) and metallic Li foil (99.9%, Aldrich).
Preparation of (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheets and Co(CO3)0.5(OH)0.11H2O nanobelts
In a typical synthesis, ethylene glycol (5–25 ml), concentrated NH3·H2O (10–12.5 ml, 28 wt%), 1M Na2CO3 aqueous solution (1–10 ml) and 1M Co (NO3)2 aqueous solution (5 ml) were mixed stepwise under vigorous stirring with 2 min intervals. After that, another 20 min were introduced into the stirring period and finally the mixture turned into a homogeneous solution with deep dark color. Once the precursor was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a volume of 45 ml, thermal treatment was performed for the Teflon liner in an electric oven at 160–200 °C for 12–48 h. After the autoclave was cooled down naturally to room temperature in a fumehood, samples deposited at the bottom were collected and washed by centrifugation for at least three cycles using de-ionized water (D.I. water) and one cycle using pure ethanol. The as-synthesized samples were then dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C overnight to remove the absorbed water for subsequent characterization.
Preparation of Co3O4 nanomeshes and mesoporous Co3O4 nanobelts
(NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheets or Co(CO3)0.5(OH)0.11H2O nanobelts were finally annealed at 250 °C for 200 min in air to be oxidized into Co3O4.
Characterization of the samples
Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL, JSM-7600F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips, Tecnai, F20, 200 kV), power X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area measurement (BET, Quantachrome Autosorb-6B surface area & Pore size analyzer), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry with a ESCALAB250 analyzer (XPS) were employed to characterize the obtained samples.
Electrochemical characterization
A homogeneous mixture comprising active material, carbon black, and poly(vinyl difluoride) (PVDF) using 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) as solvent in a weight ratio of 80:15:5 was prepared under strong magnetic stirring for at least 3 days. The mixture was then extracted and spread onto Ti foils. Before and after the samples were spread, the Ti foils had to be weighed in a high-precision analytical balance (Sartorius, max weight 5100 mg, d = 0.001 mg). The reading difference was the exact mass for the coated samples on Ti foils. The obtained pieces of Ti covered with samples were then used as working electrodes with 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (EC-DEC, v/v = 1:1) as electrolyte. Celgard 2400 was used as the separator film to isolate the two electrodes. Pure Li foil (99.9%, Aldrich) was used as counter electrode and reference electrode. The cell was assembled in an argon-filled glove-box where moisture and oxygen concentrations were strictly limited to below 1 ppm. The galvanostatic cycling was performed on Neware Battery Testing System (model of 5V1–5mA) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) was collected using Autolab (model of AUT71740) in a three-electrode cell.
Results and discussion
In this report, tricobalt tetraoxygen (Co3O4) nanomesh is introduced for the first time based on the formation of single-crystal (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet as the precursor and its subsequent conversion upon heating in air. Co3O4 is a multi-functional material frequently found in many applications, e.g. gas-sensing,13 energy storage,14,15 and selective catalysis.16,17 The Co3O4 nanomesh in our designed experiments exhibits both a well-crystallized feature and a mesoporous structure. The edge-to-edge distance between two neighboring holes or void spaces (along the oriented direction of nanoholes or nanowires) is estimated to be 2–6 nm (average value 4 nm), and the width for an individual hole ranges from 3.0 to 3.5 nm (centered at 3.27 nm). The length in the hole normally varies within several tens of nanometres. The overall dimensions for the nanomesh available in the preparation are as large as tens or even hundreds of square micrometres. Meanwhile, the thickness is less than 10 nm. By means of layer by layer stacking under aid of the hydrogen bonding interaction between (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O and ethylene glycol molecules, we propose that the lamellar structure is usually detected not only in the precursor of (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet, but also in the eventually formed C3O4 nanomesh. According to the structural information from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) characterizations, the crystal mismatch which occurs during the conversion from (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O to Co3O4 is calculated to be below 2%, which is probably why the entire Co3O4 nanomesh can demonstrate single crystallinity. The top/bottom surfaces in Co3O4 nanomesh are shown to be (12) crystal planes or its equivalents. A very high surface area, up to 382 m2 g−1, to the best of our knowledge the highest surface area among other conventional Co3O4 nanostructures, and the high energy crystal plane of (12) jointly suggest that the Co3O4 nanomesh will be desirable as a practical catalyst in important chemical reactions such as oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO),17 methane (CH4) combustion,16 and ethylene (C2H4) oxidation;18 In other applications such as electrochemical energy storage via Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs), the 2D Co3O4 nanomesh, with its high mesoporosity, could also be an important component due to its high theoretical capacity (890 mAh/g)15 and surface area. As verified in our Li-ion battery tests, Co3O4 nanomesh exhibits very high specific capacity of 1800 mAh/g within the first 20 cycles and still maintains 1200 mAh/g after 50 cycles at the charge/discharge rate of 100 mA g−1, which is the best result among other Co3O4 nanostructures used as a Li-ion battery anode. In capacitive properties tests, Co3O4 nanomesh shows promising capacitance of 297 F g−1 when scanned at 2 A g−1 in 3 M KOH aqueous solution and 288 F g−1 can be recovered from the highly accelerated scan rate of 10 A/g. The high capacitance and strong rate capability have scarcely been reported previously. More importantly, the outstanding electrochemical properties of Co3O4 nanomesh are strongly associated with its unique morphology and structure.

Fig. 1 shows the typical characterizations of Co3O4 nanomesh. Fig. 1a is the low-magnification scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image to demonstrate the uniformity and regularity in the ultimate products. From Fig. 1a, we can see that in most cases the overall size of the nanomesh exceeds 10 μm, implying that dimensions of tens, or even hundreds of square micrometres is achievable using our typical preparation method. Fig. 1b is the corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, revealing the products to be pure spinel Co3O4 (JCPDS: 42-1467). From Fig. 1c to 1f, the gradually magnified transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images are described in sequence. From Fig. 1c, some monodispersed sheet-like products are clearly detected and it is noteworthy that sometimes paired layers could be found simultaneously with a single layer as indicated in Fig. 1c. However, it is hard to decide how these sheet-like products aggregate just from Fig. 1c. More detailed characterizations have to be provided as will be presented in the following. Fig. 1d is the locally magnified TEM image to show that the sheet-like products are actually composed of many regularly dispersed nano-networks. The arrangement orientation in the networks, including the void spaces and Co3O4 nanowires, suggests that the overall product piece is most probably single crystalline because of the intrinsic anisotropy in single crystals. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (as shown in the inset of Fig. 1d) further support the above suggestion. When the scale bars are diminishing step by step to 10 nm and 2 nm as displayed in Fig. 1e and 1f, the crystal lattices with rectangular shape become more and more evident, where the Co3O4 nanowires are zigzagging and extending along a specific direction. By indexing the SAED patterns and elaborately analyzing the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images as described in Fig. 1f, the crystallization orientation is determined to be [1] or <111>, whereas the side direction perpendicular to the crystallization orientation is thereafter fixed to be [220] or <110>, and the normal direction to the entirely exposed crystal plane and coincident with the electron beam irradiation is indexed as [12]. The average diameters of Co3O4 nanowires and void spaces in nanomesh are measured as ca. 3.0 to 6.0 nm and 3.0 to 3.5 nm, respectively, implying that the thickness of the nanomesh is most likely on the order of several nanometres. Extremely small diameters in both Co3O4 nanowires and void spaces will inevitably lead to a very high surface area for the Co3O4 nanomesh. As predicted, the strikingly enhanced surface area of 382.0 m2 g−1 is verified from the nitrogen sorption isotherms measurement (Fig. 2a) and pore size distribution falls into the range of 2–4 nm centered at 3.27 nm (Fig. 2b), consistent with the result from HRTEM characterization in Fig. 1e. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest surface area ever achieved in a Co3O4 nanostructure. The exact reason why the highest surface area derives from the nanomesh architecture, we believe, is closely related to the novel and exclusive structure of the Co3O4 nanomesh: exceedingly small void spaces (3.27 nm in diameter) as well as the ultra-thin and evenly distributed Co3O4 nanowires (3–6 nm in diameter)
 Fig. 1  Morphological and structural characterizations on Co3O4 nanomesh: section (a) shows a typical SEM image in which we can see that the Co3O4 nanomesh has a very large size of up to tens of micrometres in diamter. Section (b) depicts the corresponding XRD patterns from pure phase spinel Co3O4 (JCPDS 42-1467). The layered structure is detected from the representive TEM image (c). In the enlarged TEM image (d), a networks-like morphology is exhibited and the Co3O4 nanomesh can be acribed to single crystallinity, as verified from the SAED patterns in the inset of (d). From the locally magnified TEM images (e and f), especially from (f), the crystal parameters in Co3O4 nanomesh are indexed as 0.46 nm of (1) and 0.29 nm of (220), respectively, and accordingly the crystal plane exposed to us is fixed as (12). Meanwhile, the crystallization orientation is also determined as [1]. 
 Fig. 2  Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurement for Co3O4 nanomesh is demonstrated in (a), from which the highest surface area of 382 m2 g−1 is available compared to other Co3O4 nanostructures. The size distribution derived from the desorption hysteresis is ranging from 3.0 to 3.5 nm, centered at 3.27 nm as displayed in (b). 
During the experiments, (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet had to be synthesized first as the precursor to be thermally decomposed to form Co3O4 nanomesh. In Fig. 3a, a typical SEM image is described in which we can detect that the uniform sheet-like precursors can be prepared on a large scale. The corresponding XRD patterns (Fig. 3b) are attributed to a pure single-phase (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O (JCPDS 52-0552). When (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet is exposed under electron beam irradiation, the specific character with dark or bright stripes seen inside the nanosheet (Fig. 3c) indicates the whole (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet is possibly single crystalline in nature,19,20 simultaneously implying that the nanosheet is very thin. The SAED patterns (the inset in Fig. 3c) collected from the selected circle area in Fig. 3c confirm the material's single cystallinity. Meanwhile, from Fig. 3d, the crystal lattice spacings are calculated to be 0.45 and 0.29 nm, respectively, which can be affirmed to derive from crystal planes of (200) and (012) in sequence. The above-mentioned lattice spacings are very close to those of (1) and (220) in spinel Co3O4, which actually creates a perfect prerequisite condition and provides a reasonable explanation for the subsequent chemical transformation from (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet to Co3O4 nanomesh while maintaining the single crystalline feature throughout the whole transformation. Moreover, by carefully observing (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheets in either TEM (Fig. 3c) or SEM (Fig. 3e and 3f) images, we can find that the nanosheets are typically of lamellar structure, dominated by layer-by-layer stacking. Especially from the vertical position shown in Fig. 3f, it is clearly seen that one (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet is generally composed of several pieces of thinner (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheets with tens of nanometres, (sometimes even smaller than 10 nm) in thickness (highlighted in Fig. 3f).
 Fig. 3  Typical characterizations on (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet including morphology and structure information. (a) Representative SEM image of the synthesis of (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet on a large scale. The corresponding XRD patterns prove the as-synthesized products belong to the pure phase (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O (JCPDS 52-0552) (b). Layered structure is also detected in the TEM image of (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet (c), and the SAED patterns from the inset of (b) further identify the single crystal feature in the nanosheet. By elaborate analysis of the HRTEM image (d), two crystal planes are indexed as (200) and (012), with inter-spaces of 0.45 and 0.29 nm, respectively. In (e), layered structure for (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet is found everywhere and especially from the vertical position of (f), the thickness of an individual (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet is estimated to be tens of nanometres, even smaller than 10 nm (highlighted in (f)). 
As previously reported, layered double-metal hydroxides (LDHs) exhibit layer-stacked textural property and usually consist of the anion of carbonate and hydroxyl groups.21 The anionic groups and the hydrate molecules are believed to be located among the inter-layers, serving as binding reagents to interconnect the stacking layers.22 Additionally, some monomers, pillars and polymers, including organic and inorganic anionic groups, can be intercalated into the neighboring layers via intercalation chemical approaches,23 which is why ethylene glycol (E.G.) could be applied in our case. In our design, E.G. molecules would act as molecular pillars to stabilize and isolate the formed (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O by means of hydrogen bonding action so that sheet-like samples are formed (ESI)†. In the meantime, doubly-headed hydroxyl groups in E.G. molecules would possibly bridge two adjacent (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheets just like what the isomers of secondary alkanesulfonates23 or other organic molecules do to finally generate a layer by layer stacking structure. In the following, the synthesized LDHs compounds will be readily converted into some composite oxides upon subsequent thermal treatment because of the gas emission evolving from carbonate, hydrates or other groups' physical and chemical instability. In our experiments, ammonium and cobalt ions play the cation roles instead of other common cations, e.g. Zn2+, Mg2+, Al3+, Li+. However, unlike these cations, the ammonium ion (NH4+) demonstrates a remarkable tendency of being thermally decomposable to release ammonia gas (NH3), whereas only the Co cation survives during heating. When heated in air at a temperature of 250 °C, Co3O4 will be the only stable phase since carbonate, hydroxyl groups and ammonium anions will turn into their corresponding gaseous forms at elevated temperature. Crucially, the gas emission due to the precursor's thermal decomposition will result in mesoporosity in the initial nanosheets. Accompanying the conversion from (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O to Co3O4, the valence of Co is changed simultaneously, as identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigation (ESI),† where the presence of shakeup satellite peaks24,25 distinguishes (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O from Co3O4 and is a direct evidence of the pure phase of Co2+ as well.25 Combined with the above results, it is clear that mesoporous Co3O4 nanomesh is the final product as originally designed.
Another important feature of the C3O4 nanomesh is its single crystallinity across areas as large as several hundreds of square micrometres. This is a remarkable property, especially taken together with the mesoporous structure which exhibits the highest surface area ever reported. The root cause for single crystallinity is the fact that the crystal mismatch is below 2% between (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O and Co3O4. When (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet is recrystallized and oxidized to Co3O4 nanomesh at a moderate rate, the crystal mismatch strictly controlled within a low range is highly favorable for the final product's monocrystallization process.26 As described in Scheme 1, (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet has two crystal lattice spacings of 0.45 and 0.29 nm, respectively, which are very close to those of Co3O4 nanomesh with crystal spacings of 0.46 and 0.29 nm. The crystal mismatch between (200) crystal plane of (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O and (1) crystal plane in Co3O4 is calculated to be below 2%, whereas it almost decreases to 0% while comparing (012) crystal plane of (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O to (220) crystal plane in Co3O4. Therefore, the monocrystallization and conversion process from (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O to Co3O4 can be reasonably considered as thermodynamically supported recrystallization. The formation of void spaces in Co3O4 nanomesh will compensate for and accommodate the matter's loss due to the thermal decomposition and gasification from ammonium, hydrous and carbonate groups, and is an energetically stable process as well. Similar processes have been reported before, mostly for one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures,15,27 with very few reports involving two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials. This is the first report on the successful synthesis of a free-standing, mesoporous and single-crystal nanomesh on a large scale without template assistance.
 Scheme 1  Schematics to introduce the mechanism through which the (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet is converted into Co3O4 nanomesh while maintaining the single crystal feature. The crystal mismatch between (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O and Co3O4 is below 2% from the calculation based on the crystal planes of (200) in (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O and (1) in Co3O4. For the crystal planes of (012) in (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O and (220) in Co3O4, the crystal mismatch is close to 0%. Formation of void spaces in Co3O4 nanomesh can compensate the gas emission after (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet is calcined at 250 °C, and is favorable for maintaining single crystallinity throughout the chemical conversion process. 
The preparation of Co3O4 nanomesh relies on the synthesis of (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet in advance. Some essential conditions have to be provided for the preparation, e.g. appropriate temperature, reaction time and precursors' concentrations. Among these conditions, the precursors' concentrations, especially sodium carbonate's concentration, should be paid more attention to. When sodium carbonate's concentration falls into the appropriate range, slight variations in the reaction temperature and time do not affect the results significantly. For example, high yield production of (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheets can still be expected when temperature varies from 160 to 200 °C and time varies from 12 to 48 h as long as the sodium carbonate concentration is correct. We have carried out some standard contrast experiments to uncover the importance of the sodium carbonate concentration (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the exposed crystal plane of Co3O4 on the largest scale is changed from (10) to (12) with the precursors changing from Co(CO3)0.5(OH)0.11H2O to (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O (determined by XRD measurements as shown in Fig. 5) by HRTEM characterization (Fig. 6). This finding opens up a promising route for some crucial catalytic reactions in certain aspects of selectivity and reactivity, e.g. CO oxidation and CH4 combustion, because catalytic processes critically depend on the surface atoms' arrangement and the number of dangling bonds on different crystal planes.16,17
 Fig. 4  Variation in the Na2CO3 addition leads to changes in the morphologies. S1 has a diameter of 15 nm (a) with the addition of 1 ml Na2CO3 aqueous solution (1 M); S2, 25 nm, 1.2 ml Na2CO3 aqueous solution (b); S3, 150 nm, 1.5 ml Na2CO3 aqueous solution (c); S4, 600–700 nm, 7.5 ml Na2CO3 aqueous solution (d); S5, 1 μm, 10 ml Na2CO3 aqueous solution (e); nanosheet, tens of micrometres, 5 ml Na2CO3 aqueous solution (f). 
 Fig. 5  XRD examination of samples S1 to S5 reveal the structural changes: S1–S3 are ascribed to Co(CO3)0.5(OH)0.11H2O (JCPDS 48-0083), whereas S4 and S5 are mainly composed of (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O (JCPDS 52-0552) (a). Whatever the precursors are, Co(CO3)0.5(OH)0.11H2O or (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O, they will be converted into spinel Co3O4 (JCPDS 42-1467) after calcinations at 250 °C in air (b). 
 Fig. 6  After calcinations at 250 °C in air, S1 (a and b), S3 (c and d)and S5 (e and f) are chosen to demonstrate the difference in the exposed crystal planes of the final products. S1 and S3, whose precursor is Co(CO3)0.5(OH)0.11H2O, exhibit the exposed crystal plane of (10) on the largest scale (a–d), whereas S5 with (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O as precursor, exposes the crystal plane of (12) on the largest scale (e and f). 
As a transition metal oxide, Co3O4 has attracted enormous interest in applications involving catalysis and energy storage. However, in the field of electrochemical energy storage, normally described as Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs), the specific capacity and rate capability of Co3O4 nanostructures are still too low to be practical. That is because preparing Co3O4 nanostructures in a controlled manner to form functional systems is always a great challenge.15–17 Electrochemical performance is highly associated with the materials' morphologies, architectures, surface areas, pore size distributions and other chemical or physical properties, such as conductivity, the number of active sites, surface modification etc. When Co3O4 nanostructures are used as anodes in Li-ion batteries, their initial states are generally damaged after the first cycle via a reductive process, which totally differs from the conventional alloying–dealloying process occurring in Sn,28 Ge,29 Si,30 Au,31etc. However, some common requirements, such as high surface area, good conductivity, and mesoporosity still have to be met so as to seek an optimized balance among electron transfer, electrolyte diffusion and ionic transport.15,32 In the previous reports, researchers have usually imposed most of their efforts on 0D, 1D and 3D nanostructures and few are involved in 2D materials,33–35 which may be due to the fact that 0D, 1D and 3D nanostructures are relatively easier to synthesize than 2D samples, especially when no appropriate templates are available for preparation.
Here we have investigated the application of the Co3O4 nanomesh as anode material for LIBs. As shown in Fig. 7a, cyclic voltammograms' (CVs) profiles disclose the difference between the first and second cycle when operated at a scanning rate of 0.5 mV s−1 and in a voltage window from 0.01 to 3.0 V. The two peaks located at potentials (vs. Li+/Li) 0.9 and 1.2 V are normally ascribed to the reduction processes from Co3O4 to CoO and CoO to Co, respectively. The significant changes within the reductive half-cycle imply the original states in Co3O4 have been irreversibly changed. The reduced current at the second cycle reveals that the formation of solid-electrolyte-interface (SEI) results in a large capacity loss. Such loss is also verified in Fig. 7b, the charge–discharge curves with the association of the specific capacity versus the cycle number. From Fig. 7b, we can see that when cycled at 100 mA g−1, the Co3O4 nanomesh is highly qualified to deliver the specific capacity of more than 1800 mAh/g over the first 22 cycles and is still capable of delivering no less than 1000 mAh/g in the next 30 cycles. This is a breakthrough in the specific capacity for Co3O4 nanostructures when discharged at a fairly high current density of 100 mA/g. In previous reports, the specific capacity of Co3O4 has never exceeded 1600 mAh/g, even at a low discharge rate of 50 mA/g.36 Capacity decay is rationally believed to be avoidable for pure phase materials and has been mentioned in many research reports before.27,37 Other than the high specific capacity, Co3O4 nanomesh also shows good rate capability, where the specific capacity can reach 380 mAh/g (the theoretical value for graphitized carbon) at a very high discharge rate of 1000 mA g−1 over 50 cycles. Meanwhile, the specific capacities can be maintained at high levels of 750 and 550 mAh/g, respectively, when discharged at 300 and 500 mA g−1 at least for 50 cycles. After 50 cycles, Co3O4 nanomesh continues to retain high specific capacity, although a tendency to slow decay is taking place all the time. To our knowledge, these results from Co3O4 nanomesh are the most promising as compared to those of other Co3O4 nanostructures.
 Fig. 7  Cyclic voltammograms (CV) measurement is applied to show the significant difference between the first and second cycles when charging and discharging (a). In (b), the profiles associated with the specific capacity vs. cycle number show a very high specific capacity of 1800 mAh/g at a high discharge rate of 100 mA/g. Even though the current densities increase to 300, 500 and 1000 mA g−1, the capacities can still remain 800, 550 and 380 mAh/g over 50 cycles, respectively, indicating the very high rate capability and cyclability for the Co3O4 nanomesh. When discharged at 100 mA g−1 (c) and 1000 mA g−1 (d), the average deliverable power densities are stabilized at 80 and 750 W kg−1 over 50 cycles, respectively, whereas the energy densities are delivered as the decreasing values from 1600 to 800 Wh/kg and from 700 to 200 Wh/kg, respectively. Section (e) is to show the charge–discharge profiles associated with voltage and capacities, and (f) is the coulombic efficiency based on actual charge/discharge capacities when cycled at 100 mA g−1 for 50 cycles. 
As described in Fig. 7c and 7d, the intriguing result is that Co3O4 nanomesh is able to deliver steady power even though the current density increases from 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 7c) to 1000 mA g−1 (Fig. 7d), where the average power densities delivered from Co3O4 nanomesh are 70–75 W kg−1 and 700–800 W kg−1, respectively. The stable and high power supply from LIBs is a crucial parameter to evaluate the batteries' performance and has to be seriously considered while the batteries are integrated into the practical equipment. In our research, the average energy densities are fairly stable in the first 30 cycles, delivering 1500 Wh/kg and 550 Wh/kg when operated at 100 mA g−1 and 1000 mA g−1, respectively, in spite of the decay during the last 20 cycles. This latter decay is normal for pure phase electrode material in LIBs because of its intrinsic association with the specific capacity. Aggregation and pulverization frequently happen to the pure phase material in LIBs, which weakens the interconnection among the active materials and lowers system's conductivity, leading to decay in the specific capacity.27,37 An effective way to solve the problem is to encapsulate the active materials in well-graphitized carbon shells or grow nanostructures' arrays on conductive substrates.15,28,38 In Fig. 7e, the charge-discharge profiles are shown to disclose the association between voltage and capacities where we find that the plateaus for charge and discharge fall into the ranges of 1.0–2.0 V and 1.2–0.8 V, respectively, corresponding to the typical values for Co3O4 material.13,15,27 Based on the delivered capacities at 100 mA g−1, coulombic efficiency is evaluated and shown in Fig. 7f. With the development of galvanostatic measurement, the coulombic efficiency is always increasing and finally reaches up to 90% after 50 cycles. All the electrochemical results suggest that Co3O4 nanomesh could be the anode material of choice for LIBs.
The excellent electrochemical performance of Co3O4 nanomesh in LIBs can be attributed to the benefits that unique morphology and structure provide: 1) the high surface area in Co3O4 nanomesh is favorable for the enhanced efficiency of electrolyte diffusion and Li ion transport. 2) The uniform pore size distribution at nanoscale and ultrathin Co3O4 networks are not only useful for the electrolyte diffusion, but also serve as the “sponge” to absorb the extra Li ions. That is why the specific capacity is much higher than the theoretical capacity (890 mAh/g) of Co3O4,15 though some similar results have been mentioned previously.38 3) The Co3O4 nanomesh with 2D architecture is less prone to structural collapse when cycled so the conductivity for electron transfer can be sustained, which is likely to be the reason why good rate capability and cyclability are achievable.39 4) Nanosized Co3O4 is a good catalyst for some specialized catalytic processes, for example, CO oxidation and CH4 combustion. The reasonable explanation lies in the higher surface energy compared to the bulk counterpart and the mechanism is also applicable for the reversible reaction where Co3O4 is reduced and oxidized back and forth, whereas Li2O shuttles between the metallic and oxidative states.31 5) The Co3O4 nanomesh consists of some filtration networks for electrolyte diffusion during charge/discharge. The nanoscale networks combined with the Co3O4 nano-catalytic actions will perhaps lead to the electrolyte's reversible decomposition,31 which is also important for the improved performance in specific capacity.
In order to illustrate the importance of high energy crystal planes for the electrochemical properties, the capacitive behavior of Co3O4 nanomesh (ESI)† has been evaluated by cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and galvanostatic measurements (charge/discharge). The high capacitances (152–298 F g−1) under different scan rates show that the large surface areas of active materials are extremely important for supercapacitors, whereas the good rate capability (no apparent decay with increasing scan rate) further verifies the important function of high energy crystal planes when scanned at high rates, because for Co3O4 nanomesh, the exposed crystal plane on a large scale is (12), whose energy is higher than that of the conventional planes such as (111) and (100),16 whose specific capacitances are below 20 F g−1 and degrade rapidly with increasing scan rates (ESI).†
Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully synthesized the Co3O4 nanomesh, a 2D functional material, for the first time. The Co3O4 nanomesh exhibits many attractive properties, including single crystallinity, highest surface area among Co3O4 nanostructures, mesoporosity, large overall size as high as several hundreds of micrometres, and ultrathin thickness below 10 nm. The synthetic strategy is based on the formation of (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet as precursor, followed by thermal decomposition accompanied by recrystallization. These characteristics of Co3O4 nanomesh sufficiently enhance its electrochemical performance in LIBs, resulting in the highest specific capacity compared to other Co3O4 nanostructures, along with high rate capability and stable cyclability. Additionally, the high energy crystal plane of (12) and the highest surface area imply great potential in surface-related applications, such as catalysis, sensing, and supercapacitors. More importantly, the strategy applied in the synthesis of Co3O4 nanomesh could be extended to other materials' preparation provided that the formation of precursors in the form of layered double-metal hydroxides (LDHs) is accessible. Other mesoporous oxide films such as MgO, NiO, Al2O3 or complex oxides are currently being synthesized and functionalized for electrochemical energy storage or catalysis applications. We believe this work opens up a new gateway for the synthesis of free-standing functional 2D materials on a large scale and will be of great importance in many practical uses.

Broader context
Electrochemical energy storage is more and more important in today's information-rich and mobile society, especially with the fossil sources gradually running out. Together with other power deliverable devices, e.g. solar cells, fuel cells, electrochemical energy storage will be crucial in solving the urgent problems involving energy and environmental sciences in the near future. For this topic, the great challenge is how to rationally design and fabricate functional materials to significantly enhance the related performances. Herein, a new two-dimensional (2D) Co3O4 nanostructure, denoted as nanomesh, is for the first time synthesized and applied in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as superior anode, exhibiting very high capacity of 1800 mAh/g and improved rate capability, even in supercapacitors (SCs). All enhanced performances are derived from the unique morphological and structural properties in Co3O4 nanomesh, where a display of a high energy crystal plane, mesoporosity and single crystallinity is available. The synthesis strategy is also extendable to other materials' preparation and will open up a new gateway for applications in energy and environmental sciences, including selective catalysis, energy conversion and storage, biotechnology.


 	Fig. 1  Morphological and structural characterizations on Co3O4 nanomesh: section (a) shows a typical SEM image in which we can see that the Co3O4 nanomesh has a very large size of up to tens of micrometres in diamter. Section (b) depicts the corresponding XRD patterns from pure phase spinel Co3O4 (JCPDS 42-1467). The layered structure is detected from the representive TEM image (c). In the enlarged TEM image (d), a networks-like morphology is exhibited and the Co3O4 nanomesh can be acribed to single crystallinity, as verified from the SAED patterns in the inset of (d). From the locally magnified TEM images (e and f), especially from (f), the crystal parameters in Co3O4 nanomesh are indexed as 0.46 nm of (1) and 0.29 nm of (220), respectively, and accordingly the crystal plane exposed to us is fixed as (12). Meanwhile, the crystallization orientation is also determined as [1].	 

 	Fig. 2  Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurement for Co3O4 nanomesh is demonstrated in (a), from which the highest surface area of 382 m2 g−1 is available compared to other Co3O4 nanostructures. The size distribution derived from the desorption hysteresis is ranging from 3.0 to 3.5 nm, centered at 3.27 nm as displayed in (b).	 

 	Fig. 3  Typical characterizations on (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet including morphology and structure information. (a) Representative SEM image of the synthesis of (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet on a large scale. The corresponding XRD patterns prove the as-synthesized products belong to the pure phase (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O (JCPDS 52-0552) (b). Layered structure is also detected in the TEM image of (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet (c), and the SAED patterns from the inset of (b) further identify the single crystal feature in the nanosheet. By elaborate analysis of the HRTEM image (d), two crystal planes are indexed as (200) and (012), with inter-spaces of 0.45 and 0.29 nm, respectively. In (e), layered structure for (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet is found everywhere and especially from the vertical position of (f), the thickness of an individual (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet is estimated to be tens of nanometres, even smaller than 10 nm (highlighted in (f)).	 

 	Scheme 1  Schematics to introduce the mechanism through which the (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet is converted into Co3O4 nanomesh while maintaining the single crystal feature. The crystal mismatch between (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O and Co3O4 is below 2% from the calculation based on the crystal planes of (200) in (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O and (1) in Co3O4. For the crystal planes of (012) in (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O and (220) in Co3O4, the crystal mismatch is close to 0%. Formation of void spaces in Co3O4 nanomesh can compensate the gas emission after (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O nanosheet is calcined at 250 °C, and is favorable for maintaining single crystallinity throughout the chemical conversion process.	 

 	Fig. 4  Variation in the Na2CO3 addition leads to changes in the morphologies. S1 has a diameter of 15 nm (a) with the addition of 1 ml Na2CO3 aqueous solution (1 M); S2, 25 nm, 1.2 ml Na2CO3 aqueous solution (b); S3, 150 nm, 1.5 ml Na2CO3 aqueous solution (c); S4, 600–700 nm, 7.5 ml Na2CO3 aqueous solution (d); S5, 1 μm, 10 ml Na2CO3 aqueous solution (e); nanosheet, tens of micrometres, 5 ml Na2CO3 aqueous solution (f).	 

 	Fig. 5  XRD examination of samples S1 to S5 reveal the structural changes: S1–S3 are ascribed to Co(CO3)0.5(OH)0.11H2O (JCPDS 48-0083), whereas S4 and S5 are mainly composed of (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O (JCPDS 52-0552) (a). Whatever the precursors are, Co(CO3)0.5(OH)0.11H2O or (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O, they will be converted into spinel Co3O4 (JCPDS 42-1467) after calcinations at 250 °C in air (b).	 

 	Fig. 6  After calcinations at 250 °C in air, S1 (a and b), S3 (c and d)and S5 (e and f) are chosen to demonstrate the difference in the exposed crystal planes of the final products. S1 and S3, whose precursor is Co(CO3)0.5(OH)0.11H2O, exhibit the exposed crystal plane of (10) on the largest scale (a–d), whereas S5 with (NH4)2Co8(CO3)6(OH)6·4H2O as precursor, exposes the crystal plane of (12) on the largest scale (e and f).	 

 	Fig. 7  Cyclic voltammograms (CV) measurement is applied to show the significant difference between the first and second cycles when charging and discharging (a). In (b), the profiles associated with the specific capacity vs. cycle number show a very high specific capacity of 1800 mAh/g at a high discharge rate of 100 mA/g. Even though the current densities increase to 300, 500 and 1000 mA g−1, the capacities can still remain 800, 550 and 380 mAh/g over 50 cycles, respectively, indicating the very high rate capability and cyclability for the Co3O4 nanomesh. When discharged at 100 mA g−1 (c) and 1000 mA g−1 (d), the average deliverable power densities are stabilized at 80 and 750 W kg−1 over 50 cycles, respectively, whereas the energy densities are delivered as the decreasing values from 1600 to 800 Wh/kg and from 700 to 200 Wh/kg, respectively. Section (e) is to show the charge–discharge profiles associated with voltage and capacities, and (f) is the coulombic efficiency based on actual charge/discharge capacities when cycled at 100 mA g−1 for 50 cycles.
