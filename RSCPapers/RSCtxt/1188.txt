1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskite materials have shown plenty of outstanding optoelectronic properties, such as strong light harvesting capability, long charge carrier diffusion length,2 high defect tolerance,3 large mobilities,4 very narrow photoluminescence with high quantum yield,5etc. These unique properties make them star materials for applications like solar cells, light emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, photodetectors and so on and thus have been widely studied recently.6 Especially, since the first report of perovskite solar cells by Miyasaka in 2009,7 this new class of thin-film solar cells has gone through an unprecedented rapid development.8–13 So far, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of small-area (<1 cm2) perovskite solar cells has reached 22.7% in the laboratory, and significant progress has also been made in the field of large-area perovskite modules.12–17 However, on the downside, the instability of perovskite solar cells against moisture, light and heat18–20 remains the main stumbling block towards the commercialization of this technology.
Lots of efforts have been made to enhance the stability of devices made from perovskite materials, including compositional engineering,17,21,22 interface engineering,23–28 encapsulation techniques,29 and device structure engineering.30,31 Among these, one of the promising strategies is to lower the dimensionality of perovskites from three-dimensional (3D) to two-dimensional (2D) which presents higher stability against the ambient environment.32,33 Recently, these kinds of layered 2D perovskites have been demonstrated to exhibit over 13% PCE in solar cells with better stability, compared to their 3D counterparts.34 Nevertheless, the layered structure may also bring some unfavourable characteristics. First, the undesired orientation of the layered structure can cause charge transport problems inducing charge accumulation and more recombination losses.35,36 Second, the bandgap increases when reducing the dimensionality of perovskites, leading to further deviation from the ideal bandgap for single junction solar cells. Both of the drawbacks mentioned above can degrade the efficiency of perovskite solar cells. Therefore, it is of significant importance to control the orientation and the dimensionality of the layered perovskite to achieve the optimal balance of stability and efficiency, which has already triggered enormous research interest these days.
In this review, we highlight recent advances in 2D layered perovskites for photovoltaics. First, we will present a detailed discussion of the structure of 2D layered perovskites and their unique properties. Second, the photovoltaic applications of 2D layered perovskites are divided into three parts according to their existing forms in devices and discussed, respectively. Finally, we will give a summary and outline the perspectives toward high-performance 2D layered perovskite solar cells.
2. 2D layered perovskite: structure and unique properties
In 1957, Ruddlesden and Popper first reported A2BO4 type compounds which have a similar crystal structure to today's 2D layered perovskites, and this is how the name of Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites came to use.37 The general formula of such Ruddlesden–Popper layered perovskites is (RNH3)An−1BnX3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, …) (Fig. 1a), where (An−1BnX3n+1)2− denotes the conductor layer derived from the parent 3D perovskite, such as methylammonium (MA) lead iodide (MAPbI3), formamidinium (FA) lead iodide (FAPbI3), and cesium (Cs) lead iodide (CsPbI3). The conductor layers are isolated from one another by means of R–NH3, a large aliphatic or aromatic alkylammonium spacer cation, such as phenylethylammonium (PEA) and butylammonium (BA). The thickness, which is decided by the n value in the formula, of each conductor layer can be adjusted by careful control of the stoichiometry.

R is an organic moiety, A is a small organic cation (or a monovalent inorganic cation), M is generally a divalent metal and X is a halide. The metal halide octahedral units, MX6, are shown schematically in the polyhedral representation.

The insertion of insulating spacer cations gives 2D layered perovskites unique properties compared to their 3D counterparts. First, the hydrophobic nature of the organic spacer imparts 2D perovskites with superior moisture stability. For instance, the reactions between water and MAPbI3 can be generally explained by a series of equilibria within the PbI2–MAI–H2O system as described by eqn (1)–(4).38 However, the existence of organic spacer layers slows down this reaction in the second step by isolating 3D perovskite slabs from water molecules.38 PbI2 + MAI ⇔ MAPbI3(1) MAPbI3 + H2O ⇔ MAPbI3·H2O(2) (4 − n)MAPbI3 + nMAPbI3·H2O + (2 − n)H2O ⇔ (MA)4PbI6·2H2O + 3PbI2(3) (MA)4PbI6·2H2O ⇔ PbI2 + 4MAI + 2H2O(4)
Second, the electrically insulating nature of the organic spacer and almost unchanged conductivity of the perovskite conductor layers give rise to the natural multiple-quantum-well structure as shown in Fig. 1b: the perovskite layers serve as the potential “well” while the organic spacer layers play the role of the potential “wall”.39 Excitons are formed instead of free holes and electrons when 2D layered perovskites are excited because of increased binding energy by such quantum confinement effects.40 Furthermore, the transient photoconductivity experiments by time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy verified that charges prefer to transport along the lead iodide planes, i.e. the so-called “well”.41 As the inorganic layer thickness decreases, the quantum confinement effect comes to prominence. As a result, exciton absorption and sharp emission peaks can be observed and they blue-shift when n decreases (Fig. 2a–c). In reality, it is hard to get phase-pure (perovskite crystals with the same n value) 2D layered perovskite films, and in the literature the n values are often calculated from the composition of the precursor solutions. This is corroborated by multiple exciton response peaks in absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 2d and e).42,43 Due to this fact, the charge carrier dynamics are much more complicated in 2D perovskite films than in the 3D ones. It is worth mentioning that such a multiple-quantum-well structure is favourable to light emitting diode devices. The lower bandgap regions that generate electroluminescence can be effectively confined by perovskite quantum wells with higher energy gaps, resulting in very efficient radiative recombination that leads to perovskite light emitting diodes with a high external quantum efficiency over 10%.43–45 On the other hand, such a unique structure of 2D layered perovskites also makes the charge transport in their films anisotropic and highly dependent on the orientation of the layered structure.41 The charge mobility is much higher in the direction along the perovskite slabs than in the direction perpendicular to the orientation of these slabs. Thus, for solar cells, it is important to have perovskite slabs with the out-of-plane orientation, such that thicker films with balanced charge transport and light absorption can be used to achieve a high PCE.

(e) Comparison of the emission spectra of the 2D perovskite film illuminated from the front and back sides (as illustrated in the inset) of the film.

Third, the structure of 2D perovskites can be easily tuned not only by tuning the composition of perovskite layers but also by molecular design of the spacer cations, such as alkyl chain length,46 ammonium dications,47 and insertion of the π-conjugated segment.48 Thus, a much wider range of optoelectronic properties can be tuned for 2D perovskites than for 3D perovskites. The versatility in designing the compositions and thus optoelectronic properties of 2D layer perovskites gives them the opportunity to be used in an even more broad range of applications, compared to 3D perovskites.49 Besides the most used PEA and BA, iso-butylammonium (iso-BA),50 iodoethylammonium (IC2H4NH3),51 ethylenediammonium (EDA),47 ammoniumvaleric acid (AVA),52,53 cyclopropylammonium (CA),54 polyethylenimine (PEI),55 benzylammonium (BA*),56,57 octylammonium (OA),58etc. have also been reported as spacer cations. Most recently, allylammonium (ALA) was reported to influence beneficially the distribution of quantum-well widths in low-dimensional perovskites, creating a flattened energy landscape that leads to longer diffusion lengths for electrons and holes.59
There are many other interesting properties that make 2D layered perovskite materials attractive, and probably even more to be explored in future. For example, ion migration has been an issue for perovskite solar cells using 3D perovskites, while Huang and co-workers recently reported that the activation energy of ion migration in 2D perovskites was significantly higher than that in 3D perovskites with similar compositions.60 Crochet and Mohite et al. unveiled “edge states” that existed in perovskite layers when n > 2. These states provide a direct pathway for dissociating excitons into longer-lived free carriers that substantially improve the performance of optoelectronic devices.61
3. 2D layered perovskites for photovoltaics
Taking advantage of their properties being easy to tune through chemistry and quantum mechanics, as well as their high environmental stability, 2D layered perovskites have already played an important role in perovskite photovoltaics. Herein, we discuss the progress of 2D layered perovskites for photovoltaics in three aspects, according to their main functions in perovskite solar cells (shown in Fig. 3a–d). The performance and device structures of 2D perovskite solar cells reported so far are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 3e.

3.1 2D layered perovskites with low n values as light absorbers
Nurmikko and co-workers first synthesized (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 2D layered perovskites in 1992, and their electrical properties were carefully studied.39 However, in 2014 Karunadasa and co-workers demonstrated the first usage of such 2D layered perovskites (Fig. 4a) in planar solar cells as light absorbers, yielding a PEC of 4.73%.32 A large Voc of 1.18 V was achieved because of an increased bandgap of 2.1 eV. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4b, the layered 2D perovskite demonstrates excellent stability against moisture with almost unchanged X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns after 46 days of storage at a relative humidity of 52%. Later, by replacing PEA with a non-aromatic spacer cation BA, Kanatzidis and co-workers reported (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite solar cells with a similar PCE of 4.02%.33 They found that the bandgap increased from 1.52 eV to 2.24 eV when n decreased from n = ∞ to n = 1 for BA-based perovskites. This trend is the same for PEA-based 2D perovskites. However, BA-based 2D perovskites always show smaller bandgaps than the PEA-based ones when the n value is the same, indicating that large cations do play a role in determining perovskite film properties.

(b) Powder XRD patterns of films of (PEA)2(MA)2(Pb3I10) (1), (MA)(PbI3) formed from PbI2 (2), and (MA)(PbI3) formed from PbCl2 (3), which were exposed to 52% relative humidity.

Although the device stability was significantly improved in the above-mentioned two cases, the reported PCEs were far from satisfactory. In order to achieve good perovskite solar cell performance in terms of both PCE and stability, two main factors need to be taken into consideration. First, suitable n values are required for 2D perovskites. On one hand, n should be large enough so that adequate light absorption and efficient charge extraction can be reached; on the other hand, it should also be small enough to fully keep the 2D layered nature. Second, the 2D crystals should have a good out-of-plane orientation to facilitate charge transport towards electrodes. While the n values can be largely controlled by tuning the composition of precursor solutions, the growth of those 2D perovskites with different n values shows quite different thermodynamic behaviours. For example, Kanatzidis et al. showed that the growth of (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 tended to vary from in-plane orientation to random orientation and out-of-plane orientation, with the increase of n from 1 to 4 (see Fig. 5).33 Besides, as the n value increases, the differences in the thermodynamic stability of the higher n-members become progressively smaller, and it becomes difficult to get phase-pure 2D perovskites with n > 4.66 Therefore, in order to get better control on the growth orientation and purity of 2D perovskites, new synthetic strategies are required.48

One of the biggest breakthroughs in making highly efficient and stable 2D perovskite solar cells was made by Mohite and co-workers together with Kanatzidis and co-workers, who introduced a hot-casting method for perovskite film formation.63 The hot-casting technique resulted in nearly single-crystalline films, in which the crystal grains had a strongly out-of-plane preferential alignment (Fig. 6a–c). This significantly improved the charge transport from the perovskite films to the electrodes, leading to a significant PCE improvement from 4.02% to 12.52%. Moreover, the authors used 2D perovskite single crystals to prepare the precursor solutions, ensuring clean perovskite film formation with the desired composition, as has also been reported in another work.65 Besides the high PCE, the unencapsulated devices in this work also exhibited slower degradation under constant light illumination or at high relative humidity (65% RH) than the 3D counterparts (Fig. 6d–g). This is due to the long and bulkier hydrophobic organic side groups in the 2D perovskite structure that can protect it from moisture. By borrowing this hot-casting method, Liu and co-workers prepared Cs-doped 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite solar cells with the highest reported PCE of 13.7%, using low n (n = 4) 2D perovskites. Doping Cs cations into 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskites was found to help increase the grain size, reduce the trap-state density, improve the charge carrier mobility and charge transfer kinetics and thus lead to superior PCE.34

In addition, Kanatzidis et al. further modified the hot-casting method to make it suitable for the preparation of high-quality 2D layered perovskite films with relatively high n values.66 By engineering the solvent in the precursor solutions for the hot-casting process, more specifically, by varying the ratio of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), they synthesized highly out-of-plane oriented perovskite films with n = 5. They found that, without the use of DMSO, the extremely rapid solvent evaporation during the hot-casting process led to an imperfect self-assembly of perovskite slabs and hence low crystallinity films. In contrast, the addition of DMSO, which has a high affinity for the metal halide, can result in the formation of an intermediate solvated phase that retards the crystallization rate.66,74 Planar heterojunction solar cell devices incorporating these hot-cast n = 5 films from optimized 3:1 DMF:DMSO solvent mixtures yield an impressive PCE of 10%.
Although the hot-casting method is very effective in making high-quality well-oriented 2D perovskite films, the drawbacks are that it will be difficult to precisely control the substrate temperature during spin-coating, and it may not be easy to scale up for large-area fabrication. Therefore, it is highly required to develop more convenient methods to prepare 2D perovskite films with similar properties. So far, this was mainly done by precursor engineering. For example, Liang and co-workers reported that by replacing BA with shortly branched iso-BA as the spacer cation,50 the resulting (iso-BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 exhibited a remarkable increase of orientation and crystallinity, even under the room-temperature (RT) casting conditions. For comparison, the perovskite films based on linear BA only became oriented when hot cast. As a result, the highest PCE of 8.82% was obtained for RT cast (iso-BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 based inverted bilayer solar cells. Furthermore, when the hot-casting method was applied to (iso-BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13, an even higher PCE of 10.63% was achieved. These (iso-BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 films also show superior ambient stability, maintaining their initial colour after 840 h storage without encapsulation in an environmental chamber at 20 °C and with a high RH of 60%. Zhou et al. found that the introduction of 20% FA to make ternary (BA)2(MA, FA)3Pb4I13 films could alter the crystal growth towards the out-of-plane orientation, which resulted in devices with the best efficiency of 12.81%.68
Instead of changing the composition of 2D perovskites, Chen et al. developed another precursor engineering route by applying additives to precursor solutions. For example, vertically oriented 2D layered (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3, 4) perovskite films were fabricated with the aid of ammonium thiocyanate (SCN) as an additive through a one-step spin coating process.36 The addition of SCN helped the formation of 2D perovskite films with reduced grain boundaries and also better out-of-plane orientation. Perovskite solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10/PC61BM/BCP/Ag exhibited an average PCE of 6.82% (n = 3) and 8.79% (n = 4), with impressive shelf stability in the ambient environment. Later, they further applied this additive controlled crystal growth method to prepare PEA based 2D layered perovskites with n = 5. Again, as shown by GIWAXS in Fig. 7, the addition of SCN led to vertically oriented highly crystalline 2D perovskite films. As a result, the PCE of perovskite solar cells significantly increased from 0.56% to 11.01% when SCN was added into the precursor solution.62 This PCE is also much higher than that of the device made with (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 they reported earlier. The possible reason could be that, unlike the soft linear-chain spacer BA, the rigid benzene ring in PEA may confine the structural freedom to stabilize the oriented structure and consequently facilitate the formation of highly crystalline 2D perovskite films with out-of-plane orientation even at a higher n value.62 Inspired by this additive-assisted growth method, Chen et al. further found that thiourea could also be used to guide the out-of-plane growth of FA-based 2D perovskites. Impressively, they reported a low bandgap FA-based 2D layered perovskite BA2FA2Pb3I11 with Eg = 1.51 eV,67 resulting in solar cells with a best PCE of 6.88% and negligible hysteresis.

Besides Pb-based perovskites, Sn-based 2D perovskites with low n values were also studied, and the lowering of the dimensionality had been shown to be beneficial for improving the stability of Sn-based perovskites. Recently Ning et al. realized highly oriented growth of low-dimensional (PEA)2(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 perovskites on nickel oxide (NiOx) substrates, achieving a PCE up to 5.94%.75 Their Sn-based 2D perovskites had significantly improved stability against oxidation. They claimed that the reasons for this were threefold: (1) the compact and smooth films protected the film from oxygen infiltration; (2) density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the instability against the oxidation process was suppressed with decreasing n values; (3) the hydrophobic PEA cation also protects Sn2+ from oxygen. Due to the good air stability of 2D (PEA)2(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 films, their unencapsulated devices had no appreciable decay in efficiency after storage in a glovebox over 100 h. In addition, Kanatzidis and co-workers reported (BA)2(MA)n−1SnnI3n+1 based solar cells with a promising PCE of 2.5% for the n = 4 films.65 The device maintains 90% of its initial performance after 1 month. In this case, they attributed the enhanced stability to the physical isolation of the BA spacer cations and the usage of the chemical antioxidant that suppressed the oxidation of Sn2+. Although the PCEs for such lead free 2D perovskites are low at this moment, the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency reaches 24% for the (BA)2(MA)2Sn3I10 (n = 3) perovskite,76 indicating a significant scope for improvement and promising value for single solar cells.
Most recently, halide perovskites based on group-VA cations such as Bi3+ and Sb3+ have also been reported.77–79 In general, the higher +3 oxidation state of group-VA cations thermodynamically prefers to form a zero-dimensional structure with a stable stoichiometry of A3M2X9, and this gives poor photovoltaic performance.80 However, with the introduction of small-size Rb+ and NH4+ as the A-site cations81,82 or incorporation of small-size halides at the X-site,83 the stable 2D layered perovskite phase is achievable. Despite their low PCE (just over 2%),83 these kinds of 2D layered perovskites show possibilities towards stable and low toxicity perovskite solar cells, though more efforts should be made.
3.2 2D–3D mixed perovskites as light absorbers
As the n value further increases, typically when n > 10, the properties of the resulting films are more like those of their corresponding 3D counterparts, yet one can still observe some features of 2D perovskites. In this case, the perovskite films are like a mixture of 2D and 3D perovskites. For example, Etgar and co-workers synthesized such quasi-2D mixed perovskites of (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnBr3n+1 (n = 20, 30, 40, 50, 60).71 The absorption onset of these films with high n values was close to that of the 3D MAPbBr3 film. But the 2D nature of these materials was supported by the observed reflection at 5.3° in the XRD pattern. The combination of 2D and 3D perovskites endowed their devices with an ultrahigh Voc of 1.46 V while the PCE was unaffected compared to the 3D ones, indicating them to be attractive candidates for tandem solar cells. They further studied the influence of spacer cation chain length on the properties of quasi-2D perovskites.57 No obvious change was observed in the exciton binding energy and optical bandgap by changing the spacer cations, i.e. benzyl ammonium, phenylethyl ammonium, and propylphenyl ammonium. However, the DFT and spin–orbit coupling calculations did show a decrease in electrical conductivity of the perovskite films when the length of the organic spacer cations increased.
On the other hand, Snaith et al. found that by appropriately tuning the BA-to-FA/Cs ratio in BAx(FA0.83Cs0.17)1−xPb(IyBr1−y)3 perovskite films, plate-like ‘layered’ perovskite crystallites that are oriented perpendicularly to the plane of the film would form between the 3D perovskite grains. The plate-like ‘layered’ perovskite was demonstrated by the XRD pattern to be a 2D layered perovskite that formed due to the incorporation of the BA cation in the precursor solutions. By virtue of the good lattice matching of 2D and 3D grains, the 3D perovskite grain growth was confined by the 2D grains, showing a high preference for the [100] direction to be aligned parallel to the film normal (Fig. 8a). Besides, as shown in Fig. 8b–e, since the bandgaps of 2D perovskite phases are wider than those of 3D phases, the electronic configuration allowed charges to remain in the 3D perovskite and not suffer from trapping and recombination at the grain boundaries, resulting in longer carrier lifetime. Their optimized devices showed average stabilized PCEs of 17.5 ± 1.3% and 15.8 ± 0.8% for perovskite films with bandgaps of 1.61 eV and 1.72 eV, respectively. Moreover, these devices could retain 80% of the initial PCEs even after exposure to air for 1000 h.69

Another advantage of 2D–3D mixed perovskites, which has been demonstrated by several groups, is improvement in the stability of certain perovskite phases. For instance, Jen et al. reported that the phase stability of α-phase FAPbI3 was greatly enhanced by mixing PEA cations into the film, making the FAxPEA1−xPbI3 (n = 40) film stay unchanged after being kept in the ambient environment for 30 days.70 Zhao and co-workers introduced another bication, ethylenediamine cation (EDA2+), to stabilize the α-phase CsPbI3.47 The terminal NH3+ groups on EDA2+ cations were expected to cross link the α-CsPbI3 perovskite crystal units, preventing the unwanted transition to the non-perovskite δ phase. The 2D–3D mixed films could retain their perovskite phase even after annealing at 100 °C for a week, while the neat α-CsPbI3 film transformed into a yellow δ-CsPbI3 film within 12 h even at room temperature.
In addition, instead of adding a 2D component to a 3D bulk perovskite, Mathews et al. presented an inverse strategy to get 2D/3D mixed perovskites. A pure 2D perovskite (n = 1) was deposited first by spin coating the precursor solution containing a stoichiometric ratio of PbI2 and iodoethylammonium iodide (IC2H4NH3I). The resulting film was then immersed in an isopropanol:toluene mixed solution containing methylammonium iodide for different dipping durations (1–5 min) to convert it into a higher dimensional structure (1 < n < ∞). In this case, the 2D/3D ratio could be tuned by controlling the immersion time, and thus the optoelectronic properties, as well as the stability of mixed dimensional films. For the optimized films, they achieved the best PCE over 9%.51
The 2D–3D mixed perovskite approach has also been investigated in lead-free perovskite solar cells that are more environmentally friendly but currently with low efficiency.77,84,85 Recently, Loi and co-workers pushed the record PCE of Sn-based perovskite solar cells to 9% by adding a very small amount (8 mol%) of 2D layered tin perovskite into the 3D tin perovskite. The 2D tin perovskite functioned as a seed layer to grow large and highly oriented 3D FASnI3 grains. Moreover, the 2D perovskite was also reported to fuse the FASnI3 grains together and blur the grain boundaries, which could reduce the possibility of forming Sn vacancies and Sn4+. In common with Etgar's result,71 the devices with mixed 2D/3D tin perovskites showed a higher Voc of 0.52 V than that with only the 3D tin perovskite (Voc of 0.45 V). Also, after 76 h exposure to air, the device based on the pure 3D perovskite completely failed, whereas the device based on the 2D/3D mixture retained 59% of its original PCE.73
Therefore, although 2D components typically only account for a small fraction in 2D/3D mixed perovskite films, the incorporation of a suitable amount of 2D components could significantly improve the performance of perovskite solar cells, where the 2D component acts as a functional barrier to enhance the crystal growth orientation and prevent ambient erosion.
3.3 2D layered perovskites as interface engineering layers (protection layers)
There is always a trade-off between efficiency and stability when 2D perovskites are used as absorbers in solar cells. However, the natural moisture resistance of 2D perovskites attracts people's attention to their potential as interfacial materials.
Thin 2D perovskite films can be introduced at either the bottom or top side of 3D bulk perovskites as interfacial layers. To introduce thin 2D perovskite layers to the bottom of 3D bulk perovskites, researchers often relied on the self-assembly and/or in situ formation of 2D perovskites. For example, Li and co-workers invented a universal fabrication approach for stable and efficient MAPbX3 perovskite solar cells by using in situ formed 2D perovskites as interfacial layers. The insertion of branched polyethylenimine hydriodide (PEI·HI) on top of the hole transporting layer (PEDOT:PSS) helped form a thin (PEI)2PbI4 layer during the deposition of MAPbX3 perovskites (Fig. 9a). The (PEI)2PbI4 layer served as a multifunctional interface to enhance the photovoltaic performance in three aspects: (1) control over the morphology and grain growth of 3D perovskite films on it; (2) facilitate hole extraction from the perovskite into the hole transport layer by energy level alignment (Fig. 9b); (3) improve moisture resistance with (PEI)2PbI4 at the interface. As a result, they demonstrated devices with PCEs over 16% and 13.8% on rigid and flexible substrates, respectively, as well as enhanced moisture stability (Fig. 9c–f).86 Recently, one-year stable perovskite solar cells were reported by Nazeeruddin and co-workers.53 An exceptional gradually organized multi-dimensional interface was formed in their 2D/3D perovskite junction, resulting in devices with the best PCE of 11.2% and stability for >10000 h with zero loss. Different from the work mentioned above, the 2D component was found to self-assemble between the metal oxide layer and 3D perovskite bulk after spin coating the precursor solution containing a small amount (<5% molar ratio) of aminovaleric acid iodide (AVAI). The favourable anchoring of the carboxylic acid group of the AVAI ligand triggered the self-assembly of the 2D perovskite phase onto the TiO2 scaffold. Moreover, this interface also promoted the oriented growth of the bulk 3D perovskite phase. Therefore, this 2D/3D interface brings together the enhanced stability of 2D perovskites and excellent charge transport of the 3D ones.

Self-assembly and in situ formation could be a simple and practical way to introduce thin 2D perovskite layers to the bottom of 3D bulk perovskites. However, a specific structure is needed, and thus the choice of 2D perovskites is limited, which is unsatisfactory in terms of interface engineering. On the other hand, from the processing compatibility point of view, introducing 2D perovskites on top of 3D perovskites seems to be much easier to be realized. A variety of materials, including lead-free 2D perovskites like MA3Bi2I9,77 have been demonstrated as effective interfacial layers to improve device performance, with examples shown below.
Yang et al. fabricated a 3D–2D (MAPbI3–PEA2Pb2I4) graded perovskite interface on top of the bulk 3D perovskite layer. The deposition process was based on a solvent engineering method but with a key modification: a PEAI/toluene solution was used for the solvent dripping process instead of pure toluene. The 3D–2D graded interface modified the interface energy level and led to devices with an ultrahigh Voc of 1.17 V and a PCE of 19.89%. More importantly, the graded interface also served as a self-encapsulation layer, suppressing internal cross-layer ion diffusion, slowing down the decomposition and degradation of the active layer and metal electrode in the ambient environment, etc.72
Similarly, Shi et al. demonstrated another approach to form a cyclopropylammonium (CA) based 2D perovskite (CA2PbI4) interfacial layer to cover the 3D perovskite (MAPbIxCl3−x). In their case, an additional spin coating of cyclopropylammonium iodide (CAI) solution in IPA was done on top of the annealed 3D perovskite film. The thickness of the in situ 2D perovskite layer was adjustable according to the CAI concentration in solution. The devices with the optimized 2D perovskite interface achieved a comparable PCE of 13.86% as compared to those without such an interfacial layer. However, they showed enhanced ambient stability by maintaining 54% of the original efficiency after 220 h, whereas the 3D perovskite device lost all the efficiency within only 50 h.54
Besides ammonium salts with large cations, different types of amines have also been utilized to form 2D perovskite interface layers on 3D perovskites, with the same approach as Shi et al. For example, Wong et al. applied benzylamine (BA*) solution on top of the 3D FA0.15Cs0.85Pb(I0.73Br0.27)3 lattice (Fig. 10a), leading to the formation of a 2D layered perovskite  at grain boundaries and also the top surface.55 Perovskite films with such post-deposition treatment can suppress the photoinduced phase separation and decomposition, which are known for the high bandgap hybrid halogen Br/I.87 The photostability and thermal stability tests showed that, after 8 h ageing, the untreated films already presented a distinct XRD signal of PbI2 at 2θ = 12.7°, indicating decomposition of the film, and the main XRD peak at 20.20° split into two peaks indicating phase segregation. In contrast, the BA*-treated films showed no obvious decomposition as well as phase segregation (Fig. 10b–e). In addition, the champion devices based on the BA*-treated film exhibited a stabilized power output efficiency of 17.1% and a high Voc of 1.24 V. They maintained 80% of their original PCEs after 40 d exposure in ambient air with a humidity of 65 ± 5% RH, whereas the untreated devices degraded rapidly after 2 weeks.56 Zhao and co-workers also treated their 3D FAPbI3 perovskite films with aniline, benzylamine, and phenethylamine to compare the effects of different amines. They found that the benzylamine modified films showed much better moisture resistance as compared to the others, despite the similarity in their chemical structures. The benzylamine treated films remained unchanged after exposure to air (50 ± 5 RH%) for >2900 h, while the untreated films degraded completely within 90 h under the same storage conditions.88 They explained this as a molecular passivation effect because of the existence of the hydrophobic aromatic group which prevents the water molecule diffusion. However, according to Wong's view, it might be attributed to the formation of a thin 2D perovskite at interfaces after benzylamine treatment.

Compared to 2D/3D mixed perovskites as light absorbers, the introduction of 2D perovskites as interfacial layers seems to be simpler and more effective. Most importantly, the crucial n value and the total thickness of the 2D perovskite layer are tunable by changing the stoichiometric composition and concentration of solutions, which gives a lot of freedom for material engineering in a controlled way. Moreover, either the self-assembled or post-treated 2D perovskite mainly existed on the surface of the whole active layer, and thus could keep all the advantages of 3D perovskites. Besides, the structural similarity of 2D and 3D perovskites guarantees a well-matched interface between 2D and 3D layers. Therefore, highly efficient perovskite solar cells can be expected with this approach.
4. Challenges and outlook
In the past few years, we have seen encouraging progress in perovskite solar cells based on 2D perovskites, with many demonstrations of devices showing high efficiency and long stability. Nevertheless, the efficiency of the devices based on 2D perovskites with low n values are still lagging far behind their 3D counterparts. Considering the increase of the bandgap with the decrease of the perovskite dimensionality, this type of perovskite may not be ideal materials for single junction perovskite solar cells since they will show intrinsically lower efficiency than the 3D ones. But they can be good large bandgap candidates for tandem solar cells and can possibly provide both high efficiency and good stability. On the other hand, devices with the 2D/3D mixed perovskites have shown similar efficiency but enhanced ambient stability compared to the ones based on their corresponding 3D counterparts, making them promising materials for further development. The approach of introducing 2D perovskites as interfacial layers has shown some success, yet a full understanding of the roles of such layers and treatments that are more generic and less delicate is still required. In terms of Sn-based perovskites, lowering their dimensionality seems to be a good way to prevent them from oxidation, but the device performance still needs to be improved.
To look forward, it is still necessary to gain more knowledge on the formation mechanism of 2D layered perovskites. This will enable us to fabricate phase-pure and highly out-of-plane oriented 2D perovskites or to grow 2D perovskites in a 3D perovskite matrix in a more controlled way. In addition, a scalable deposition method should be demonstrated for 2D perovskites, since there are no high-efficiency large area modules reported for these materials so far. As for stability, researchers mainly focus on the ambient stability of 2D perovskites at this moment, but ambient stability can be readily solved by encapsulation, making it less important in real application. Therefore, more focus should be put on the intrinsic heat or light stability of 2D perovskites, in order to prove they are essentially better than their 3D counterparts. With material engineering, a large variety of novel 2D perovskites can be fabricated, and it will be interesting to investigate their properties and performance in different aspects. Overall, this is an exciting field to research and we can expect a lot more stimulating progress in the near future, which may eventually bring perovskite solar cells to commercialization.

 	Fig. 1  (a) The crystalline structures of layered perovskites derived from the basic 3D AMX3 structure by taking cuts along the 〈100〉 crystallographic direction. R is an organic moiety, A is a small organic cation (or a monovalent inorganic cation), M is generally a divalent metal and X is a halide. The metal halide octahedral units, MX6, are shown schematically in the polyhedral representation. (b) Schematic of the organic–inorganic perovskite structure and the most commonly resulting energy level arrangement. Inorganic slabs alternate with organic layers having a much wider bandgap, resulting in a quantum well structure.1 Adapted with permission from ref. 1.
