    , Accepted 13th March 2012First published on 3rd April 2012AbstractIn this study, we investigated bulk-heterojunction solar cells composed of PC61BM and squaraine dyes with different donor subunits. Both, H- and J-aggregates, have been observed for the squaraine dyes in the mixture, even for the same dye depending on the annealing conditions of the blends. Supramolecular organization of the squaraine dyes noticeably affects solar cell performance. The J-aggregate exhibits a red-shift of the absorption maximum that results in a significant increase in the short-circuit current and decrease in the open-circuit voltage compared to the as-cast device. The H-aggregate shows a blue-shift in the absorption maximum and concomitantly only a moderate increase in the short-circuit current as well as an increase in the open-circuit voltage. The course of domain growth during annealing was monitored by local photocurrent mapping.
Introduction
Recent developments in organic bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell technology have pushed power conversion efficiencies (PCE) for polymer/fullerene BHJ close to 8%1–3 and above 6% for single-layer small molecule/fullerene BHJ cells.4,5 Significant improvements in open-circuit voltage (VOC) have been achieved by tuning the energy levels of the donor with respect to the acceptor energy levels.6 Maximizing the short-circuit current density (JSC) has been addressed by adjusting the donor band gap towards the near infrared (NIR) in order to have a favorable overlap with the solar spectrum.7 Further, because of the high transparency of biological tissue toward NIR light, NIR BHJ materials have been recommended as wireless electrical sources for biological nanodevices.8 The impressive improvements in VOC and JSC achieved by these strategies are primarily due to molecular level tuning. Control over supramolecular dye organization may provide another route for improvements.9 Although the influence of dye morphology on exciton and charge-carrier mobility as well as exciton separation and charge generation efficiency has been well-studied,10–14 the impact of dye aggregation on VOC and JSC remains an open question.
Squaraine dyes15 appear to be a very suitable class of dyes to elucidate the influence of aggregation on photovoltaic performance. Firstly, they have been successfully applied in solution-processed and vapor-deposited BHJ solar cells as they combine the advantages of easy donor band gap adjustment and simple processing through synthetic introduction of appropriate substituents.16–18 Secondly, squaraine dyes exhibit pronounced aggregation features as they are known to form H- and J-aggregates both, in solution and in solid Langmuir–Blodgett films.19,20 Polymorphism, i.e. the formation of different molecular arrangements in a solid molecular material, is a rather common phenomenon. It is, however, very rare that the different arrangements can be monitored in such a straightforward manner as for squaraine dyes where a pronounced excitonic coupling of their rather large transition dipole moments leads to pronounced shifts of the absorption bands that are easy to monitor by UV–Vis spectroscopy and even recognized by the naked eye.21 Furthermore, absorption bands of squaraine dyes can be easily shifted into the highly desired NIR range.18,22 In this work, we demonstrate that the annealing conditions may be used to control the aggregation behavior of squaraine dyes (Fig. 1) to obtain either extended H- or extended J-type domains within BHJ layers with a PC61BM acceptor. These studies provide unprecedented insight into the impact of dye aggregation on solar cell device performance, unlike most annealing studies (thermal, solvent soaking, etc.) leading to non-specific morphology changes.

Experimental
Several squaraine dye derivatives X1–X2 (XO, S, Se, see Fig. 1) have been synthesized as reported previously.18 Their oxidation potentials (EOx) were determined by cyclic voltammetry calibrated against the ferrocene–ferrocenium redox couple (see Fig. S1, ESI†). Thin films of the pristine squaraine dyes or of squaraine/PC61BM (60∶40 by weight) blends were fabricated on PEDOT/PSS-coated ITO/glass substrates by spin-coating (Table 1). For solar cell fabrication a Ca/Al top metal contact was deposited by thermal evaporation in a subsequent step. The annealing step was performed after metal deposition to obtain sufficiently large and well defined domains (see Fig. S2, ESI†). The diffusional mobility of molecules is known to be hindered by the metal layer.23 As a consequence, domain growth occurs much slower and results in more uniform films.

Local photocurrent maps were obtained by scanning the device with a 40 μm diameter laser at a wavelength of 405 nm. The laser beam induces a local photocurrent sensitive to the local morphology that is detected under short-circuit conditions.
Overall, some tens of devices of each compound were prepared and characterized. Deviations in photovoltaic parameters between several devices prepared under specific conditions as detailed below are rather small and can be neglected compared to the pronounced differences observed for devices formed from J- or H-type aggregation.
Results and discussion
UV-Vis spectroscopy

Fig. 2 shows the UV–Vis absorption spectra of the spin-casted films of pristine squaraine dyes before (black lines) and after (grey/red lines) thermal annealing at 110 °C. The spectra of the as-cast films resemble those of the dyes in solution with a moderate bathochromic shift and band broadening attributed to the more polarizable environment. Accordingly, there is no evidence for a particular supramolecular ordering in these films, and based on the spectra we conclude that deposition by spin-coating affords amorphous solids (referred to as A) composed of disordered dye molecules. Upon thermal annealing, however, significant changes in morphology are observed for all compounds leading to red-shifted (referred to as R) absorption bands for O–S and S–S dyes, band splitting into a red- and a blue-shifted (referred to as B) bands for the S–Se dye and band broadening for the O–O dye. The red-shifted spectra of O–S and S–S dyes show typical features of J-aggregates24,25 and are accordingly attributed to a slipped supramolecular arrangement of aggregated squaraine dyes according to Kasha's molecular exciton model.26,27 For S–S the magnitude of the shift reaches a maximum of +94 nm which is in the same range as the most pronounced bathochromic displacements observed upon self-assembly of cyanine- and chlorophyll dyes into J-aggregates.25
 Fig. 2  UV–Vis spectra of monomeric dyes in dichloromethane solution (black dashed) and the pristine substances as cast (black line) and annealed at 110 °C (red/grey line). Solution and amorphous film spectra are normalized. The spectra of the annealed films are divided by the normalization factor of the respective amorphous film to keep the original proportion between the amorphous and the annealed film. (a) O–O, (b) O–S, (c) S–S, (d) S–Se. 
The situation for S–Se and O–O dyes is not as clear. For S–Se either a dye arrangement with allowed H- and J-type transitions (Davidov splitting) or the coexistence of two domains with different dye arrangements is possible. Based on the studies discussed below we conclude that the second situation applies to the S–Se dye.

Fig. 3 shows the UV–Vis absorption spectra of the blends with PC61BM as used in the solar cells. At first glance they follow a similar trend as for the pristine films. In all cases, the as cast films show spectral positions similar to monomeric squaraine dyes, pointing at the absence of defined aggregates.

The spectra of the annealed films are divided by the normalization factor of the respective amorphous film to keep the original proportion between the amorphous and the annealed film. In all cases (except for panel d, red line), annealing was performed with metal top electrodes. (a) O–O (grey: annealed at 110 °C), (b) O–S (red: annealed at 110 °C), (c) S–S (orange: annealed at 110 °C; red: annealed at 150 °C, blue: annealed at 150 °C), (d) S–Se (blue: annealed at 110 °C; red: annealed at 110 °C without metal top electrodes). 
Upon annealing of the O–O/PC61BM and O–S/PC61BM blends in the presence of the metal top electrodes (for details, see ESI†) similar dye domains are formed as for the pristine films, i.e. broadening of the absorption band of O–O and formation of R domains consisting of J-aggregates for O–S. Interestingly, for the S–S and S–Se/PC61BM blends, the formation of both, R or B morphologies, is observed depending on the annealing conditions (see also Table 2). Annealing the S–S/PC61BM film at 110 °C leads to the exclusive formation of R, whereas annealing at 150 °C leads to the simultaneous appearance of R and B domains (Fig. 3c, red and blue lines, respectively). Note that the domains are of sufficient size for resolving the individual domains with an ordinary UV–Vis spectrometer. Accordingly, these R and B domains may be related to H- and J-bands originating from two different types of supramolecular arrangement of the same squaraine dye.25–27 This bias in the aggregation behavior towards formation of B domains in the presence of PC61BM and metal top electrodes (i.e. conditions relevant for solar cell manufacture) is further corroborated by the S–Se/PC61BM blend (Fig. 3d). In contrast, in the absence of the metal electrode the exclusive formation of R domains is observed under otherwise identical annealing conditions, pointing at the influence of the metal electrode on domain growth. In both cases, raising the annealing temperature above 110 °C did not affect the nature of the domains.

Fig. 4a depicts a schematic of the organized transition dipoles leading to H- and J-aggregates and the resulting formation of excitonic bands. Although this scheme is general for all squaraine dyes investigated in this work, we will focus the following discussion on the most illustrative example, i.e. the S–S/PC61BM blend (Fig. 3c) where four different aggregation states could be obtained by the choice of the annealing temperature (Table 2). The amorphous state of the solar cell is denoted as A, and the red-shifted domain obtained at an annealing temperature of 110 °C is denoted as R-110. The red- and blue-shifted domains obtained at an annealing temperature of 150 °C are denoted as R-150 and B-150, respectively (see Table 2). Mixed domain devices such as A/R-110 and R-150/B-150 were also frequently observed.
 Fig. 4  (a) Schematic representation of the ground and excited state in a monomer (middle, black) and H-aggregates (left, blue) and J-aggregates (right, red). The latter two form excitonic bands where the highest oscillator strength is either on the high energy (H-aggregate) or low energy (J-aggregate) edge. (b) Qualitative schematic representation of the HOMO level of the squaraine donor and LUMO level of the PC61BM acceptor in amorphous (middle, black), H-aggregate (left, blue) and J-aggregate (right, red) of S–S/PC61BM blends. The squaraine/PC61BM edge-on interaction for the H-aggregate and the side-on interaction for the J-aggregate are depicted. 
The vertical stacking of parallel transition dipoles leads to the formation of an excitonic band where optical transitions from the ground state to the excited state are allowed to the upper edge of the excitonic band and mostly forbidden to the lower band edge.26,27 The resulting absorption band is, therefore, blue-shifted with respect to the monomer or to the amorphous state absorption in the case of a thin film. The absorption band of B-150 is characteristic of an H-aggregated state as the transitions with the highest oscillator strength are found at the high-energy edge of the absorption band with a tail to lower energies corresponding to the forbidden energy levels at the lower excitonic H-band edge. The position of the visible absorption maximum of R-150 is almost the mirror image of the B-150 absorption maximum centered about the absorption of S–S in dichloromethane. The R-150 absorption band is red-shifted with respect to the monomer or amorphous-state absorption, and the transitions with the highest oscillator strengths are at lower energies corresponding to the allowed transitions to the lower band edge of the excitonic J-band.
The rationale for the subtle balance between distinctively different packing arrangements in these squaraine dyes appears to relate to the domain size. As shown in our earlier work,18 a brickwork-type packing is found for single crystals of the S–S dye. This packing—typical for J-aggregates25—is the thermodynamically most favored one for extended domains (as given in a single crystal). However, if the domain size is reduced to lateral dimensions below 10 nm, where only a couple of these molecules (molecular length is roughly ∼2 nm) form the brick wall, this arrangement (Fig. 4b, right) becomes destabilized, and a face-to-face dye packing in columns (Fig. 4b, left) is expected to be thermodynamically more favored. Accordingly, these squaraine/PC61BM blend materials offer a unique system where the formation of domains with distinct dye arrangements can be monitored easily by UV–Vis spectroscopy. For the S–S/PC61BM blend the supramolecular dye organization may be switched from J-aggregated, R, to H-aggregated, B, domains by a simple increase of the annealing temperature. This unusual property has enabled us to elucidate the influence of dye arrangement on the photovoltaic performance of solar cells composed of a blend of identical constituent building blocks.

S–S/PC61BM solar cells
The local photocurrent maps in Fig. 5a show the domain growth of A into R-110. Domain formation starts at different nucleation centers and spreads radially over the device. Annealing times may vary from 15 minutes to two hours, depending on how many nucleation centers are present. The photocurrent map of a R-150/B-150 device and the corresponding micrograph are shown in Fig. 5b. The photocurrent map reproduces the two different domains also visible in the micrograph. The higher local photocurrent of B-150 reflects the higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) at 405 nm, the wavelength of the scanning laser. At higher temperatures, domain growth is faster and is complete after 15 minutes annealing time, however, selectivity is lost, and both R-150 and B-150 domains form randomly.
 Fig. 5  (a) The course of domain growth of R-110 (orange) is monitored by local photocurrent mapping before annealing (0% R-110) and after 15, 30 and 120 min annealing at 110 °C (21%, 46% and 100% of the device area is occupied by R-110). (b) Photocurrent map and micrograph of the same R-150/B-150 device. 
In Fig. 6a–c, the EQE and the J–V characteristic of the different domain types of the S–S/PC61BM blend are displayed. In general, annealing leads to an improvement of the PCE compared to the as-cast device (see Table 2). This is due to an increase in both JSC and fill factor (FF) upon aggregation, the former being particularly enhanced for red-shifted domains. VOC values are also affected by the domain type. A blue-shift in the UV–Vis spectra is always accompanied by an increase of VOC, while a red-shift always results in a decrease of VOC.
 Fig. 6  (a) UV–Vis spectra, (b) EQE spectra and (c) J–V characteristic of the S–S/PC61BM thin film. A is represented in black, R-110 in orange, R-150 in red and B-150 is represented in blue. The black dotted line is the absorption spectrum of S–S measured in dichloromethane solution. The absorption maximum is set to the absorption maximum of A. 
Compared with morphology A, the EQE of R-110 is 3–5 times higher and extends into the NIR spectral range due to the bathochromic shift upon dye aggregation. The outstandingly high JSC of R-110 can be attributed to the J-aggregation of the squaraine donor dyes, leading to an improved morphology. This arrangement provides better conduction pathways for excitons and holes, while maintaining a sufficiently large interface with the acceptor PC61BM. Efficient exciton transport in J-aggregates is well documented from natural light-harvesting systems based on J-aggregated chlorophyll dyes28 and photographic sensitizers based on J-aggregated cyanine dyes.29 From experimental and theoretical studies these exciton transport properties are attributed to the delocalization of the exciton at the low energy edge of the exciton band, enabling fast exciton hopping by dipole-allowed transitions between identical chromophores.30,31 With regard to charge-carrier transport the situation is more complex, because the transfer integrals between neighboring dyes depend strongly on orbital interactions, i.e. HOMOs for the case of hole transport.32 Irrespective of the transfer integrals between neighboring dyes, two-dimensional brickwork-type J-coupled packing motifs may provide two-dimensional percolation pathways for charges. Field-effect mobility measurements of bottom-gate devices reveal an increase of the hole-mobility by approximately one order of magnitude in the S–S/PC61BM blend upon annealing (see Table S2, ESI†). In accordance with the increased hole mobility an increased FF is observed for devices with J-type aggregation morphology.
Both, R-150 and B-150 devices, exhibit increased JSC of similar magnitude with respect to A, but are far inferior to R-110. At annealing temperatures above the glass transition of PC61BM (∼131 °C),33 larger PC61BM crystals develop. This enhanced phase separation reduces the donor–acceptor interface and hence reduces the JSC and EQE.34 An increase of JSC is observed for all other squaraine dye blends upon formation of aggregated domains by thermal annealing at 110 °C (Table 2). For J-aggregated R domains of O–S the effect is of similar magnitude as for S–S, whilst for S–Se the R domains appear to be inferior to B domains. For this dye, however, the preparation of R domains required a special procedure (i.e. prior annealing before deposition of the metal electrode) which might impair the quality of the solar cell device.
The second notable influence of aggregated domains (B, R) on the photovoltaic device characteristics is the change of VOC in comparison to the as-cast amorphous blend (A). The formation of B is always accompanied by an increase of VOC, while formation of R always results in a decrease of VOC (see Table 2). Ultimately, the VOC in a BHJ is limited by the HOMO energy levels of the donor, and the LUMO energy levels of the acceptor or rather the resulting charge transfer states.6,35–38 The relevant energy levels are depicted in Fig. 4b. Due to aggregation (H and J), one would expect band formation and, therefore, an increase of the resulting HOMO levels and a lowering of the LUMO levels. This would result in a lower VOC as it is the case for R-150 and R-110. However, B-150 devices show a pronounced increase in VOC. A possible explanation in terms of energy levels is a significant difference of the nature of the donor–acceptor interface as it is indicated in Fig. 4b.39 In the vertically stacked H-aggregate the donor–acceptor interface is dominated by edge-on PC61BM–squaraine interactions, while the J-aggregate is dominated by side-on PC61BM–squaraine interactions. This may result in an additional shift of the involved HOMO and LUMO levels or rather charge transfer levels leading to the observed differences in VOC.40,41 Also, the (geminate or non-geminate) recombination of charge carriers in the film under working conditions might be different, too.
Two-domain devices

Fig. 7 shows the evolution of VOC and JSC of two-domain solar cells, A/R-110 and R-150/B-150 respectively, as a function of the area occupied by the respective domains. For both series, an almost perfect linear relationship is observed for VOC and JSC as a function of the ratio between the two domains. For A/R-110 mixtures the dependence of JSC on the fraction of J-aggregated domain is particularly impressive as is the dependence of VOC for R-150/B-150 mixtures on the ratio between J- and H-aggregated domains. Only the VOC dependence of the A/R-110 series shows a slight deviation from the linear relationship at small fractions of aggregated dye. Accordingly, the two-domain solar cells behave as if they were two separate single-domain solar cells connected in parallel.42 The contribution of each domain scales with the area fraction occupied by the respective domain. The J–V curves of the A/R-110 two-domain devices for different states of aggregation can be calculated from the J–V curves of the involved single domain devices by solving the following equation for each applied voltage V JA/R-110A/R-110A/R-110A/R-110A/R-110(V) = AR-110R-110R-110R-110JR-110R-110R-110R-110(V) + (1 − AR-110R-110R-110R-110)JAAA(V)(1)where AR-110R-110R-110R-110 is the fraction of the area occupied by R-110. The J–V curves of R-150/B-150 two-domain devices are calculated similarly.

OC (a) and JSC (b) of A/R110 (open circles) and R-150/B-150 (open triangles) solar cells as a function of the area fraction occupied by the respective domains. All solar cells in this plot were measured under 88 mW cm−2 illumination, except the single domain solar cells R-150 and B-150. These devices were measured under 100 mW cm−2 illumination and their device characteristics have been corrected for 88 mW cm−2 illumination for better comparison. 
The solar cell characteristics obtained by these calculated J–V curves are represented in Fig. 8 by the black lines. There is quite good agreement between experiment and calculation.
 Fig. 8  Measured (closed circles) and calculated (lines) J–V curves according to eqn (1). The black lines and the corresponding experimental data (open circles) represent 13%, 41% and 84% area occupation by R-110. The experimental J–V curves were measured under 88 mW cm−2 illumination. 
The main difference between the A/R-110 and the R-150/B-150 series of devices is the different behavior of VOC. In the case of the A/R-110 devices only a small fraction of R-110 is necessary to reach the characteristic value of VOC for the entirely J-aggregated device (R-150). We hypothesize that the reason for this behavior is related to the pronounced difference between A and R-110 regarding their ability to generate current (Table 2). As a consequence, the shape of the resulting JA/R-110A/R-110A/R-110A/R-110A/R-110–V curve is dominated by the shape of the JR-110R-110R-110R-110–V at an early state of growth as evident in Fig. 8. Unlike A/R-110 blends, the current generation of R-150 and B-150 is in the same order of magnitude and as a result the VOC scales approximately linearly with the area occupied by the respective domain (see Fig. 7). Notably, the calculated solar cell characteristics of the A/R-110 devices show a better fit to the experimental solar cell characteristics than the R-150/B-150 devices. This might be related to the fact that in the first case the same solar cell has been measured at different states of growth whereas in the latter case different solar cells were measured at their final aggregation state from different batches. The aggregation process and, therefore, the final morphology is very sensitive to the initial aggregation conditions after spin-coating. These conditions are not easily controlled, and typical JSC values of different batches vary around 15% while variations of VOC do not exceed 0.02 V.
Conclusions
For the first time, BHJ solar cells have been prepared with a single donor dye capable of forming amorphous as well as aggregated domains with clearly distinguishable H- and J-type absorption bands. By careful adjustment of the thermal annealing conditions we were able to fabricate solar cells containing exclusively one aggregation type. This unique control over dye morphology enabled investigation of the aggregation effects on solar cell performance. While VOC is larger for blends where the dyes form H-aggregate domains, JSC is significantly improved by the presence of J-aggregated domains. The latter fact should be related to the more favorable exciton transport characteristics of J-aggregates, which accordingly would allow charge to reach the D–A interface for larger domain sizes. Furthermore, we were able to visualize the domain growth by photocurrent mapping and show how the individual aggregation types contribute to the final solar cell characteristic in two-domain devices.

 	Fig. 4  (a) Schematic representation of the ground and excited state in a monomer (middle, black) and H-aggregates (left, blue) and J-aggregates (right, red). The latter two form excitonic bands where the highest oscillator strength is either on the high energy (H-aggregate) or low energy (J-aggregate) edge. (b) Qualitative schematic representation of the HOMO level of the squaraine donor and LUMO level of the PC61BM acceptor in amorphous (middle, black), H-aggregate (left, blue) and J-aggregate (right, red) of S–S/PC61BM blends. The squaraine/PC61BM edge-on interaction for the H-aggregate and the side-on interaction for the J-aggregate are depicted.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) The course of domain growth of R-110 (orange) is monitored by local photocurrent mapping before annealing (0% R-110) and after 15, 30 and 120 min annealing at 110 °C (21%, 46% and 100% of the device area is occupied by R-110). (b) Photocurrent map and micrograph of the same R-150/B-150 device.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) UV–Vis spectra, (b) EQE spectra and (c) J–V characteristic of the S–S/PC61BM thin film. A is represented in black, R-110 in orange, R-150 in red and B-150 is represented in blue. The black dotted line is the absorption spectrum of S–S measured in dichloromethane solution. The absorption maximum is set to the absorption maximum of A.

OC (a) and JSC (b) of A/R110 (open circles) and R-150/B-150 (open triangles) solar cells as a function of the area fraction occupied by the respective domains. All solar cells in this plot were measured under 88 mW cm−2 illumination, except the single domain solar cells R-150 and B-150. These devices were measured under 100 mW cm−2 illumination and their device characteristics have been corrected for 88 mW cm−2 illumination for better comparison.	 

 	Fig. 8  Measured (closed circles) and calculated (lines) J–V curves according to eqn (1). The black lines and the corresponding experimental data (open circles) represent 13%, 41% and 84% area occupation by R-110. The experimental J–V curves were measured under 88 mW cm−2 illumination.
