    , Accepted 10th April 2023First published on 11th April 2023Abstract2D organic–inorganic lead iodide perovskites (HO(CH2)4NH3)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, and 4) were prepared and showed enhanced UV stability due to the additional inner hydrogen bonds between adjacent spacer cations, compared with the counterpart (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2PbI4 without the additional inner hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bonds were formed between the hydroxyl groups of the organic spacer cations BA–OH+ and were demonstrated by the 1H NMR chemical shift of the active hydrogen of the spacer's hydroxyl groups. The 2D (HO(CH2)4NH3)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites remained stable after 10 days of UV radiation, while the (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2PbI4 perovskites decomposed after 3 days of UV radiation, as indicated by the XRD results.
Introduction
As emerging semiconductor materials, organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have promising applications in the fields of solar cells, light-emitting diodes and photodetectors due to their easy solution-based preparation and tunable band gaps.1–5 In particular, two-dimensional (2D) organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites, with the general formula of (RNH3)2An−1PbnX3n+1 (RNH3 is an aliphatic or aromatic alkylammonium spacer cation, A is a monovalent organic cation, X is a halide anion and n represents the number of inorganic octahedral layers),6 have attracted broad attention due to their quantum confinement effect7–9 and improved air stability compared with 3D perovskites.10–14
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites would degrade under illumination of light with a certain photo energy, which triggers the dissociation of N–H in organic cations, and activates the Pb–I bonds. The generated gaseous amines and HI were subsequently released from the corroded edges and surface and left solid PbI2.15–18 For example, the degradation of MAPbI3 would occur under the illumination of light (Eph ≥ 2.72 eV),15 the degradation rate increases with the increase of photo energy (i.e. the decrease in wavelength), and thus the perovskites were extremely sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light. Furthermore, many perovskite solar cells are equipped with ultraviolet filters to keep them working stably under sunlight illumination even when it contains only 5% UV light with 90% UVa (320–400 nm) and 10% UVb (280–320 nm).19,20 Therefore, we should pay more attention to the UV stability of perovskites when they are used as semiconductor photovoltage materials in solar cells for practical applications.
Some methods have been adopted to improve the UV stability of the perovskites. For example, Lv et al. introduced 1,6-diaminohexane ammonium iodide to prepare a Dion–Jacobson phase 2D perovskite capping layer in a 2D/3D stacking structure which exhibits superior UV stability and can protect the 3D layer underneath from decomposition under UV light.21 Wang et al. used 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone as the UV absorber of the perovskite solar cells, and it retained 80% of its initial conversion efficiency after 24 h while the pristine counterpart only retained 20%.19
A recent report by Proppe et al. indicated that the interaction of the spacer cations of 2D perovskites could improve the stability of the materials. They activated the vinyl groups of the spacer cations of 4-vinylbenzylammonium using UV light to form a cross-linked cation structure in the 2D perovskites (n = 1 and 2), resulting in an improved operational stability of the 2D/3D hybrid perovskite solar cells.22 In this report, we investigated the hydrogen bonds in the 2D perovskites (HO(CH2)4NH3)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, and 4) and the enhanced UV stability due to the hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen bonds were formed between the hydroxyl end groups of the organic spacer cations of BA–OH+ and reduced the van der Waals gaps thus inhibiting the photoinduced dissociation of organic cations.
Experimental
Materials
Lead oxide (PbO), aqueous hydriodic acid solution (HI, 57 wt%), aqueous hypophosphorous acid solution (H3PO2, 50 wt%), 4-amino-1-butanol (HO(CH2)4NH2), butylamine (n-CH3(CH2)3NH2), methylamine (CH3NH2), dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (C2D6OS, DMSO) and acetone (C3H6O, AC) were provided by Beijing Innochem Technology Co. Ltd.
Synthesis of (BA)2PbI4
The mixture including PbO (2.232 g), aqueous HI (10 mL) and H3PO2 (1.7 mL) was stirred in a round bottom flask and heated to a boil forming a bright yellow PbI2 solution. Then n-CH3(CH2)3NH2 (1848 μL) was added into the aqueous HI solution (10 mL) in a separate beaker to prepare the n-CH3(CH2)3NH3I (BAI) solution in an ice bath. The precipitate was produced after adding the BAI solution into the boiled bright yellow PbI2 solution. After that, the precipitate was dissolved again by heating and then cooled to produce the orange crystal of (BA)2PbI4 perovskites. Finally, the crystal was filtered and dried under vacuum at 40 °C for 24 h.
Synthesis of (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4)
PbI2 solution was prepared in the same way as mentioned above. Then HO(CH2)4NH2 (1840 μL) was added into the aqueous HI solution (10 mL) to prepare the HO(CH2)4NH2I (BA–OHI) solution in an ice bath. The crystals of (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) were separately obtained by adding BA–OHI solution and the corresponding amount of CH3NH2 (0, 338, 450, 510 mg) into the PbI2 solution. Finally, the crystals were filtered and dried under vacuum at 40 °C for 24 h.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Philips X’Pert Pro MPD diffractometer. The Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were obtained via a Nicolet 380 FT-IR spectrometer and the samples were prepared using the KBr pellet method. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) patterns were obtained using an Escalab 250Xi spectrometer. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 SEM microscope. The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were tested using a Shimadzu UV-3600 Plus spectrophotometer, using BaSO4 as the reflectance sample. 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer where the samples were diluted into DMSO to obtain a concentration of 0.04 mol L−1. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired using a FS5 Spectrofluorophotometer.
UV stability
The perovskite samples were exposed to continuous UV radiation in a closed cavity at room temperature and about 30% relative humidity (RH). (BA)2PbI4 was used as the control sample. A En-280l type UV lamp was used as the UV light source within the wavelength range of 320–400 nm (center wavelength was 365 nm) and at a power density of 1090 μW cm−2.
Results and discussion
The cross-linking method has been widely used in polymer materials to improve the mechanical properties. Organic molecular cross-linking has also been adopted to improve the intensity of the fragile silica aerogels. The organic spacer cations were oppositely arranged between the inorganic lead halide layers in the RP typed 2D perovskites. Therefore, it was reasonable to infer that the coherent energy, intensity and stability of the RP typed 2D perovskites would be increased, if the spacer cations could be bonded together through some cross-linking methods, such as hydrogen bonds in this study. When BA–OH+ with a hydroxyl end group was used as the spacer cations, hydrogen bonds were formed between the oppositely arranged spacer cations in the prepared 2D perovskites, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the prepared hydrogen bond-containing 2D perovskites (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4). The series of XRD diffraction peaks by sample (BA–OH)2PbI4 in Fig. 2(A) corresponded to the (00l) planes of the 2D layered structure of (BA–OH)2PbI4, and we used the four-index system which is suitable for hexagonal systems to determine the equivalence among crystal planes instead of Miller's three-index system.23,24 These (00l) diffraction peaks of (BA–OH)2PbI4 presented smaller 2-theta angles compared with those of (BA)2PbI4 in Fig. S1 (ESI†), implying the bigger basal spacing of (BA–OH)2PbI4 (1.53 nm) than that of (BA)2PbI4 (1.38 nm) as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†),6 which may be a result of the increased size of the organic spacer cations of BA–OH between the inorganic lead iodide layers. Since the spacer cations in (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 2, 3, 4) were arranged with an inclined profile, the (00l) diffraction peaks disappeared and the new diffraction peaks corresponding to (020), (040), (060) and (080) planes appeared, as shown in Fig. 2(B–D). At the same time, the samples (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 2, 3, and 4) showed the (111) diffraction peaks with 2θ at 14.1°, demonstrating the multilayer structure of the 2D perovskites.25 The basal spacings of (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 2, 3, 4) were calculated to be 1.93, 2.57 and 3.11 nm respectively based on the (020) diffraction peaks with 2θ at 4.57, 3.43 and 2.83°. The difference between them was about 0.6 nm, i.e. the thickness of a single lead iodide layer, which was consistent with the results of (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 2, 3, 4).6,25 In addition, the basal spacings of (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 2, 3, 4) were smaller than the predicted values derived from that of (BA–OH)2PbI4, which may be related to the incline of the spacer cations in (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 2, 3, 4).

The SEM images of the prepared perovskites (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, and 4) in Fig. 3 and (BA)2PbI4 in Fig. S3 (ESI†) showed clear 2D planes and the steps by these planes, which further indicated the 2D layered micro-structures of the prepared perovskites and they were also consistent with previous reports.26

The XPS survey spectra in Fig. 4(A) presented the chemical compositions of I, N, C and Pb by sample (BA)2PbI4 and I, O, N, C and Pb by sample (BA–OH)2PbI4. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra in Fig. 4(B) showed the PL emission peaks at 2.20 and 2.38 eV by sample (BA)2PbI426,27 and the PL emission peaks at 2.34 and 2.48 eV by sample (BA–OH)2PbI4. The increased energy of PL peaks by (BA–OH)2PbI4 compared with that of (BA)2PbI4 indicated the enlarged semiconductor band gap of (BA–OH)2PbI4, which might be caused by the bigger basal spacing with a lower state electron density.

In order to verify the hydrogen bonds in the prepared 2D (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites, we recorded the 1H NMR spectra of samples HO(CH2)4NH2 and (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1, as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S4 (ESI†). All the samples were separately diluted into DMSO solvents to the same concentration of 0.04 mol L−1, low enough to avoid the interaction between HO(CH2)4NH2 molecules in the control sample HO(CH2)4NH2, in order to compare the chemical shifts of the active hydrogen in the hydroxyl group by different samples. The chemical shift of the active hydrogen of the hydroxyl groups in sample HO(CH2)4NH2 was 2.58 ppm (Fig. 5A), while the chemical shifts of active hydrogen in the hydroxyl groups in the samples (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 moved to the lower field at 3.42 (n = 1, Fig. 5B), 3.38 (n = 2), 3.35 (n = 3) and 3.29 (n = 4) ppm (Fig. S4, ESI†). This variation in the chemical shifts in the 1H NMR spectra of samples (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 compared with that of sample HO(CH2)4NH2 was attributed to the hydrogen bonds formed between the hydroxyl groups of BA–OH+ in (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1.28,29 When the hydrogen bonds formed, the electron density around the active hydrogen atom was reduced due to the action of the electrostatic field, causing a de-shielding effect and the chemical shifts moved to the lower field.30,31 Furthermore, a summary of δ(OH) in (BA–OH)2PbI4 with different concentrations is given in Table 1. The chemical shifts (from 3.36 to 4.36) increased with the increase in sample concentrations, indicating the existence of inner hydrogen bonds in BA–OH+ as well.

The FT-IR spectra of HO(CH2)4NH2 and (BA–OH)2PbI4 are shown in Fig. 6. The absorption peaks of the hydroxyl groups by HO(CH2)4NH2 and (BA–OH)2PbI4 were at ∼3532 and ∼3437 cm−1. The absorption peak of the hydroxyl groups in sample (BA–OH)2PbI4 moved to a lower wavenumber compared with that of the control sample HO(CH2)4NH2. This IR absorption shift of the hydroxyl group towards to lower wavenumber between HO(CH2)4NH2 and (BA–OH)2PbI4 was a result of the hydrogen bonds in sample (BA–OH)2PbI4, which reduced the bond polarity and the subsequent vibration frequency of the hydroxyl groups.32–35

UV stability
The UV stabilities of the 2D (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, and 4) perovskites with hydrogen bonds were characterized by their XRD patterns after UV radiation within 10 days, as shown in Fig. 7. And the XRD patterns of (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) in the 10 days of UV radiation have not changed, indicating the structure integrity of these samples in the 10 days of UV radiation. In contrast, the 2D (BA)2PbI4 perovskite without hydrogen bonds showed a PbI2 diffraction peak at a 2-theta angle of 12.7° besides the (004) peak of (BA)2PbI4 after 3 days of UV radiation,36 and the PbI2 diffraction peak gradually enhanced as the UV radiation time extended up to 10 days, as seen in Fig. S5 (ESI†), indicating the gradually increased decomposition of (BA)2PbI4 after the UV radiation from 3 to 10 days. These XRD results of (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 and (BA)2PbI4 indicated the improved UV stability of the additional inner hydrogen bonds of (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites in comparison with the counterpart (BA)2PbI4 without that, and the UV stability of the RP typed 2D (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites could be improved by the hydrogen bonds between their organic spacer cations, which reduced the van der Waals gaps,37 thus inhibiting the photoinduced dissociation of organic cations and preventing (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 from degrading under UV light irradiation.

The UV stabilities of perovskites at other humidities (0% RH and about 15% RH) and under irradiation of ultraviolet light with a higher energy (254 nm) were tested as well. Moisture is one of the vital factors contributing to the degradation of perovskites,38 and the BA2PbI4 degraded slower than that at 30% RH, however, the stabilities of (HO(CH2)4NH3)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 were much better than that of BA2PbI4 which partially degraded at 0% RH within 10 days and degraded into PbI2 at 15% RH within 10 days under the same conditions as the XRD results showed in Fig. S6 and S7 (ESI†). Under the irradiation of higher energy light, the BA2PbI4 degraded faster which basically degraded into PbI2 within 7 days, while the (HO(CH2)4NH3)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 remained stable (Fig. S8, ESI†).
As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the band gaps of pristine (BA)2PbI4, (BA–OH)2PbI4 after 7 days of UV light irradiation and PbI2 are 545 nm, 517 nm and 533 nm, respectively. Obviously, there are two band gaps of the (BA)2PbI4 after 7 days UV light irradiation sample, the 545 nm one matched with the (BA)2PbI4, and the 533 nm one matched with the PbI2, which also demonstrates that the (BA)2PbI4 decomposed and produced PbI2,39–41 consistent with the results of XRD in Fig. S5 (ESI†).
The UV stabilities of the 2D (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites were further demonstrated by the PL emission spectra after UV radiation within 7 days, as shown in Fig. 8. The intensities of the PL emission peaks at 2.20 and 2.38 eV by the sample (BA)2PbI4 decreased dramatically from the initial to the 7 days of UV radiation sample, indicating the gradual decomposing of the materials. In contrast, the intensity differences of the PL emission peaks at 2.34 and 2.48 eV by the (BA–OH)2PbI4 sample containing hydrogen bonds were very small within the 7 days of UV radiation, indicating the the UV stability of the perovskites with hydrogen bonds.

Conclusions
Hydrogen bonds were introduced into the 2D organic–inorganic lead iodide perovskites (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, and 4) through the organic spacer cations of BA–OH+. The UV stabilities of the 2D (BA–OH)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites were improved due to the hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of the spacer cations which reduced the van der Waals gaps and inhibited the degradation, while the 2D perovskite (BA)2PbI4 without additional inner hydrogen bonds was sensitive to the UV light and degraded into PbI2. This work plays an important role in enhancing the stability of perovskite materials and provides a new type of highly stable material for photoelectric fields.
