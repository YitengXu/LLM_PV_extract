    , Accepted 30th September 2013First published on 4th November 2013AbstractWe report on the fabrication of polycrystalline Cu2ZnGeX4 (X = S, Se) thin films using spray pyrolysis followed by post-sulfurization and post-selenization. The stoichiometric, morphological, structural and optical properties of fabricated thin films were investigated and discussed in the photovoltaic aspect. Although the as-sprayed films were observed to be grown with poor crystalline texture, the crystallinity was found to be greatly improved after post-sulfurization and post-selenization, which was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The band gap energy was estimated as 1.88–1.93 eV for post-sulfurized Cu2ZnGeS4 (CZGS) films and 1.40–1.43 eV for post-selenized Cu2ZnGeSe4 (CZGSe) films by UV-Vis absorption measurements. The crystal lattice parameters calculated from XRD patterns for post-sulfurized CZGS and post-selenized CZGSe films were found to be consistent with kesterite structure which is strongly supported by the band gap energy estimated from the UV-Vis absorption measurements.
1. Introduction
The research in photovoltaic is rapidly increasing to meet the demand for sustainable green energy using low cost and non-toxic materials. The current technologies using CdTe and CIGS absorber system have achieved best efficiency for thin film photovoltaic devices1 but the non-abundance of Ga, In and Te may limit their future.2 There is therefore an increasing research demand to expand the range of absorber materials that are earth abundant and non-toxic as viable alternatives of rare elements; Te, In, Ga and toxic Cd which are used in CdTe and CIGS thin film solar cell.
Recently, copper based quaternary chalcogenide semiconductors of Cu2–II–IV–VI4 (II = Zn, Cd; IV = Ge, Sn; VI = S, Se) family have been intensively investigated in multiple applications; photovoltaic,3,4 non-linear optics,5 thermoelectric6,7 and topological insulator.8,9 Especially, the quaternary semiconductors are material of high interest in the field of photovoltaic research as alternatives of CdTe and Cu(In1−xGax)Se2 because of abundance, low cost and nontoxic elements having structural freedom3,10 with optimal direct band gap which can be widely tuned.11 Earth abundant Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) kesterite thin films have been attracting significant attention for low cost photovoltaic applications. This quaternary exhibits direct band gap tuning ~ 1.1–1.5 eV by varying Se to S content (optimal band gap range for good photovoltaic absorber) and high absorption coefficient 104 cm−1 in the visible spectrum range.12 Recently, the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) for CZTSSe solar cell made by hydrazine-adopted solution process reported to be 11.1%.13 In the search for other Cu-based quaternary chalcogenide semiconductor candidates, Cu2ZnGeSe4 (CZGSe) of quaternary family is also reported as one of the promising photo-absorber materials in photovoltaic application. Germanium having crustal abundance of 1.5 mg kg−1 in CZGS compares favorably with the 2.3 mg kg−1 crustal abundance of Sn in CZTS14 which shows its possibility as one of the alternatives of CIGS and CdTe in term of costs. Chen et al.10 and Zang et al.15 studied the electronic structure, stability properties and band structure of Cu-based quaternary chalcogenide semiconductors for photovoltaic applications. CZGX (X = S or Se) has been reported to have three fundamental crystal structures i.e. kesterite (KS) [space group I], stannite structure (ST) [space group I2m] and primitive mixed CuAu like structure (PMCA) [space group P2m], where KS is derived from chalcopyrite (CH) structure and ST and PMCA are derived from CuAu(CA) like structure.10,15 It is to be noted that stannite has the same symmetry as a specific disordering of kesterite phase.10 There is the need of more experimental and theoretical studies on the CZGSe quaternary compound to get a deeper understanding for its application in different aspects. Some experimental studies were carried out on quaternary compound semiconductor with Ge to investigate the structural, optical and electrical properties. Single crystals of Cu2ZnGeSe4 (CZGSe) and Cu2ZnGeS4 (CZGS) were grown by a chemical vapor transport reactions with iodine as a transport agent and their crystal structure was investigated.16,17 Matsushita et al. reported the growth of CZGSe single crystal by the horizontal gradient freezing method from the stoichiometric melt having stannite structure with p-type conductivity.3 Furthermore, CZGSe thin films were fabricated by co-evaporation to characterize the growth properties and crystallinity,18 bulk crystal by chemical transport reaction method to study the optical properties19 and nanocrystal by a solution method using reacting metal complexes and chalcogen to study the thermoelectric properties.7 Some research groups have experimentally estimated the band gap energy; 1.63 eV,3 1.6 eV18 and 1.52 eV19 for CZGSe and 2.2 eV for CZGS20 which show variation and somewhat over estimation in comparison to the reported theoretical values. The lattice parameters and band gap energy reported for CZGSe and CZGS have been summarized in Table 1. These reports reveal that CZGSe has an optimal band gap energy suitable for thin film solar cell. In addition to that, the band gap of CZGSe can also be tuned by alloying of Sn and Ge with proper proportion during fabrication. The solar cell using absorber layer CZTSSe with Ge alloying has demonstrated improved efficiency.21

Apart from the vacuum and non-vacuum methods cited aforementioned for fabrication of CZGS or CZGSe films, chemical spray pyrolysis (CSP) is a versatile and low cost chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique, which is extensively used to synthesize selenide, sulfide and oxide semiconductor films.22–26 Spray pyrolysis is a easy, simple, fast and continuous processing method among the aerosol process. The stoichiometry of the film can be controlled by taking preferable concentration of corresponding chemicals during the preparation of solution (precursors). The application of spray pyrolysis in industry is very promising because of the low running cost and large area deposition.22,23 In the present work, we have grown CZGS and CZGSe films by using electrostatic field assisted CSP technique and subsequent post-sulfurization and post-selenization for the first time. The fabricated thin films were characterized by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. In this paper, we have presented the growth of polycrystalline CZGS and CZGSe films with compositional, structural and optical properties.
2. Experimental details
For the deposition of CZGS thin film, we prepared three different aqueous solutions dissolving cupric chloride (CuCl2), zinc chloride (ZnCl2), germanium dioxide (GeO2) and thiourea [SC(NH2)2] with three different molar ratios as CuCl2:ZnCl2:GeO2:SC(NH2)2 = (1.8, 2.0, 2.2):1.2:1:16 and 20 mM concentration in de-ionized water (DIW). The solution precursors with excess SC(NH2)2 were used to minimize oxidation and sulfur deficiency in the as-sprayed CZGS film. The home-made ultrasonic spray system is used for deposition of thin film in which high electrostatic field of 30 kV is applied between the outlet of aerosol flow pipe and the substrate holder base plate as reported in the spray pyrolysis technique.23,24 We deposited CZGS thin films on molybdenum coated soda lime glass (Mo-SLG) substrate from the three different solutions at the constant substrate temperature of 470 °C using an electrostatic field assisted spray system. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas to flow the mist of aqueous solution of precursors. We synthesized three types of CZGS thin films with different Cu-molar ratio. The film processing sequence is as shown in Fig. 1(a). The as-sprayed CZGS films were sulfurized under sulfur vapor at ~500 °C for 25 min and naturally cooled down to room temperature. We used S powder as S vapor source, which was put inside a graphite box together with the sample. The closed graphite box is effective to get higher S partial pressure near the sample surface. During the annealing process, nitrogen gas was flowed at atmosphere pressure condition. Similarly, the post-selenized CZGSe films were made by selenization of sulfurized CZGS films by annealing under selenium vapor ambient at ~520 °C for 20 min keeping the sample inside the graphite box filled with selenium powder under nitrogen flow. The temperature profile for our sulfurization and selenization is shown in Fig. 1(c). We also fabricated ternary chalcogenide Cu2GeS3 (CGS) and Cu2GeSe3 (CGSe) films followed by post-sulfurization and post-selenization of the as-sprayed thin films to identify the possible secondary phase in the post-sulfurized (selenized) CZGS(CZGSe) films. For this spray, we used an aqueous precursor solution with CuCl2:GeO2:SC(NH2)2 = 2:1:16. Furthermore, to investigate band gaps of CZGS and CZGSe, we also made the same films on soda lime glass (SLG) following exactly the same method and condition as those deposited on Mo-SLG as mentioned above.

The morphology and stoichiometry of as-sprayed CZGS, post-sulfurized CZGS and post-selenized CZGSe films were studied by FE-SEM (Jeol, JSM-7001F) equipped with EDS (Oxford, INCA). The crystal structure of the fabricated films was investigated by using XRD system (Rigaku, Smart Lab) with Cu-Kα source (λ = 1.5412 Å). All XRD results were obtained in 2θ scanning mode at 3° min−1 scanning rate. In order to identify the possible phase in the film, Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed using a Spectro Raman system equipped with a laser of excitation wavelength λ = 532 nm (irradiation power < 1 mW) and Horiba Jobin-Yvon LabRAM HR800 Raman system equipped with a laser of excitation wavelength λ = 355 nm (irradiation power < 0.5 mW). The band gap energies of fabricated films were investigated by the measurement of the transmission and absorption spectra with a UV-Vis spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Lambda 40).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Stoichiometry and morphology
The stoichiometry of as-sprayed CZGS, post-sulfurized CZGS and post-selenized CZGSe thin films with different molar ratios was analyzed by EDS measurements. A brief overview of EDS results for elemental compositions of thin films is shown in Table 2. We studied atomic percentage of constituent elements Cu, Zn, Ge, S and Se in each film. The calculated atomic percentage ratios i.e. Cu/(Zn + Ge), Zn/Ge, S/Z or Se/Z (Z = Cu + Zn + Ge) reflect the stoichiometry of respective films. The tabulated composition data for as-sprayed CZGS films were found to be poor stoichiometry having high oxygen content nearly 1:1 ratio of sulfur to oxygen. This result was not far from our expectation because the sprayed films were prepared at elevated substrate temperature of 470 °C in non-vacuum system so there is a high possibility of oxygen incorporation during the spray. It can be supposed that the sulfur deficiency is compensated by the presence of oxygen. These results suggest that the further sulfurization is essential to get stoichiometric and oxygen free CZGS films. The EDS data for post-sulfurized and post-selenized films show much improved stoichiometry and highly reduction in oxygen percentage as compared to the as-sprayed films. The ratio of Zn to Ge seems to be fluctuating which may be due to evaporation of some contents in the form of chalcogenide during annealing at high temperature under sulfur or selenium ambient. It needs further study about chemical kinetics of this material to get stability in cations stoichiometry. The tabulated data also reveal that the content of sulfur and selenium is improved by the post-sulfurization and post-selenization of as-sprayed films with drastic decrease in oxygen content. However, the cations ratios of constituent elements reflect a little bit inconsistency, the overall stoichiometry of post-sulfurized and post-selenized films are acceptable. We believe that the annealing of as-sprayed CZGS films in sulfur (selenium) ambient is essential to make robust and oxygen free films having acceptable stoichiometry. It is to be noted that the post-sulfurized CZGS and post-selenized CZGSe films with satisfying stoichiometry and single phase is a primary concern for their use as absorber layers for photovoltaics.

Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of surface; as-sprayed CZGS (a1,b1,c1), post-sulfurized CZGS (a2,b2,c2) and post-selenized CZGSe (a3,b3,c3) films with magnified surface morphology and inset cross-sectional SEM images. The SEM images of all as-sprayed CZGS films show somewhat non-uniform surface with rough texture whereas the post-sulfurized and post-selenized films exhibit more uniform and compact surface morphology. The cross-sectional SEM images of post-sulfurized CZGS and post-selenized CZGSe films show well developed and compact grain structure compared to those of as-sprayed CZGS films. The thickness of all fabricated films are found to be 1.5–3 μm. The magnified top view SEM images for post-sulfurized CZGS and post-selenized films show somewhat uniform and compact morphology, which indicates that the uniformity, compactness and grain structure of as-sprayed CZGS film can be improved by post-sulfurization and post-selenization. We usually observed much more enlarged grain structure in the post-selenized CZGSe film compared to post-sulfurized CGZS film. It is reported that the absorber layer having compact, uniform and larger grain size is beneficial for thin film solar cell fabrication27 and hence the post-selenized CZGSe film seems to be better in this respect.

The inserted image at the bottom of right corner depicts cross-sectional SEM image of respective film. 
3.2. Crystal structure and phase
The crystal structure and quality of fabricated thin films were studied by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. Peak assignment of XRD patterns was performed with the reference of ICDD database28 for CZGS, CZGSe, CGS and CGSe. Here, Fig. 3 shows XRD results and Raman spectra of as-sprayed CZGS films deposited with varying Cu-molar ratio by copper rich (CR) (2.2:1.2:1:16), copper correct (CC) (2.0:1.2:1:16) and copper poor (CP) (1.8:1.2:1:16). The XRD patterns in Fig. 3(a) reveal small and broad peaks corresponding to (112), (200), (004), (220), (204) and (312) planes of polycrystalline CZGS phase28 (tetragonal, space group I-2m (121), ICDD No-00-0250327; XRD reference). It does not show any extra peak for secondary phases like Cu2GeS3, ZnS, CuxSy, GeS etc. The wide and small peaks indicate poor crystallinity of as-sprayed CZGS films. Although the EDS result of as-sprayed films reveal nearly 1:1 ratio of oxygen and sulfur, XRD patterns do not show any oxide phases. It also has been reported that oxygen present in sulfur deficient chalcogenide film co-exists with sulfur by compensating its stoichiometry.29,30 Therefore it is believed that the oxygen and sulfur must co-exist in CZGS crystal phase in the form Cu2ZnGeS4−xOx and hence the XRD peaks are found to be small and broad with shifted position of 2θ in XRD patterns. The existence of the CZGS phase in as-sprayed films is further analyzed by the Raman spectroscopy measurement as shown in Fig. 3(b). It shows a small and broad Raman peak at ~347.60 cm−1 for as-sprayed CR CZGS, at 347.67 cm−1 for as-sprayed CC CZGS and at ~346.1 cm−1 for as-sprayed CP CZGS, which implies the poor crystal quality of as-sprayed CZGS films.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns (a) and Raman spectra (b) of as-sprayed CZGS films. 
The typical XRD peaks of post-sulfurized polycrystalline CZGS and ternary phase Cu2GeS3 (CGS) films are shown in Fig. 4(a). The XRD patterns of post-sulfurized CZGS films show sharp peaks corresponding to (112), (200), (220), (204), (312) and (116) orientation of CZGS single phase28 (tetragonal, space group I-2m (121), ICDD No-00-025-0327; XRD reference). This result indicates that the crystallinity of as-sprayed CZGS films is significantly improved as result of post-sulfurization. The XRD results of ternary chalcogenide CGS reveal sharp dominant peak at 2θ ~29.20° corresponding to (112) plane along with smaller peaks of (200), (004), (220), (312) and (116) orientation28 (tetragonal, space group I-42d (122); XRD reference). It is observed that 2θ positions of dominant peaks of CZGS (~29.10°) and CGS (~29.20°) are close which makes it difficult to confirm the single phase of quaternary compound from XRD pattern analysis. It is to be noted that the main diffraction peaks of CZGS, CGS and ZnS are very close and may overlap. Raman spectroscopy is more sensitive for detection of possible ternary and secondary phase. The Raman spectroscopy results of post-sulfurized CZGS films in Fig. 4(b) exhibit relatively sharp and enhanced peaks. The Raman peaks for post-sulfurized CR-CZGS film are observed at ~358 cm−1 as main peak and other peaks at ~293.7, 315 and 402 cm−1. Similarly, post-sulfurized CC-CZGS film shows main peak at ~358.3 cm−1 and other peaks at ~ 293.8, 314.6 and 402.3 cm−1 and post-sulfurized CP-CZGS film also exhibits dominant Raman peak at ~358.4 cm−1 and other peaks at ~ 294, 314.8 and 402.7 cm−1. It is reported that possible secondary phases, Cu2−xS, has Raman peaks at 475 cm−1 (strong, A1(LO) mode) and 264 cm−1(weak, A1(TO) mode),31 ZnS shows Raman peaks at 348, 696 and 1044 cm−1 which are reported as first-, second- and third-order peaks32,33 and MoS2 exhibits Raman peaks at 288 cm−1 (E1g mode), 384 cm−1 (E12g mode) and 410 cm−1 (A1g mode).34,35 Since UV-Raman is more sensitive for the detection of ZnS phase in the sample, the Raman spectroscopy of post-sulfurized CZGS samples was measured using Raman scattering system with 355 nm (UV) excitation wavelength. Fig. 4(c) depicts the UV Raman spectra of post-sulfurized CZGS films along with ZnS film as reference. Raman peaks assigned at 347.2 and 695.78 cm−1 for ZnS films are found to be well-matched to the first and second order peaks characteristic of the ZnS phase32,33 while the post-sulfurized CZGS films do not show any significant peaks which could be assigned to ZnS phase. The UV-Raman peaks (Fig. 4(c)) observed around 356.3 and 711.25 cm−1 correspond to CZGS phase as reported for CZTS.32 No peaks for possible binary secondary phases are found to be assigned in CZGS Raman spectra measured with excitation wavelength 532 and 355 nm. Moreover, the Raman spectra of ternary CGS shows dominant peak at ~393 cm−1 with some smaller peaks at ~417, 334, 273 and 242.2 cm−1 as shown in Fig. 4(b). The comparative study of Raman spectra for post-sulfurized CZGS and CGS films confirms that the ternary CGS does not exist in post-sulfurized CZGS thin films as secondary phase.
 Fig. 4  Comparisons of XRD results (a) and Raman spectra (b) with excitation wavelength 532 nm (b) and 355 nm (c) of post-sulfurized CZGS films and ternary phase CGS thin film. Here, dominant XRD peaks of CZGSe (~29.10°) and CGS (~29.20°) appear to be nearly overlapped whereas Raman spectra show exclusively CZGS phase peaks in post-sulfurized films. 

Fig. 5 presents XRD results and Raman spectra of post-selenized CZGSe and ternary CGSe thin films. The XRD peaks are observed to be sharp and high which indicates good crystallinity of post-selenized CZGSe thin films. CZGSe thin films show a dominant peak at 2θ ~27.7° corresponding to (112) orientation and smaller peaks with (200), (220), (204), (312), (116), (400) and (008) planes in XRD patterns assigned with reference28 (tetragonal, space group I-2m (121), ICDD No-00-055-0294 XRD reference). The XRD results for CZGSe films are also found to be well matched to the report by Matsushita et al.3 The ternary CGSe shows dominant XRD peak with (011) reflection at ~27.96° along with (312), (020) and (321) planes.28 Since the dominant peak of ternary CGSe is observed to be nearly overlapped to dominant (112) peak of CZGSe film, it makes difficult to distinguish the existence of ternary phase Cu2GeSe3 in Cu2ZnGeSe4 films. It is also to be noted that the main diffraction peaks of CZGSe, CGSe and ZnSe are very close and may overlap. To get more conclusive evidence, we analyzed the Raman spectra of post-selenized CZGSe and CGSe films as depicted in Fig. 5(b). The Raman spectra show peaks at ~204.2 cm−1 (dominant peak) and ~176 cm−1 for post-selenized CR-CZGSe. Similarly, the Raman spectra for post-selenized CC-CZGSe exhibit peaks at 204 and 176 cm−1 and for post-selenized CP-CZGSe peaks are observed around 204.4 and 177 cm−1. As for concern of possible secondary phases in CZGSe film, it is reported that secondary phases, Cu2Se or CuSe2, has Raman peaks at 270 cm−136 and peaks at 147 and 260 cm−1 are assigned to CuSe.37,38 MoSe2 can be identified by Raman peaks at 169, 240, 280 and 350 cm−139,40 and ZnSe phase can be detected at 210 and 254 cm−1.41 Herein, we just observed Cu2Se or CuSe2 secondary phase in Raman spectra of CZGSe thin films. No noticeable peak is found to be assigned characteristic to ZnSe phase in Raman spectroscopy results of post-selenized CZGSe films using 532 and 355 nm laser excitation. ZnSe phase is more sensitive to ~442 nm laser. However, since no ZnS phase is detected in the CZGS film, we believe that no ZnSe phase is in the subsequently selenized CZGSe film. Furthermore, Raman result of ternary phase CGSe film exhibits peaks at ~191 and 230 cm−1 which showed nearly agreement with Raman active A2 mode at 189 cm−1 and 230 cm−1.42 Hence it implies that the all post-selenized CZGSe films consist of exclusively quaternary CZGSe single phase. Thus the analysis of XRD results and Raman spectra confirms the fact that the post-sulfurized CZGS and post selenized CZGSe films have dominant single quaternary phase with good crystallinity. Moreover, the tetragonal unit cell expands when S in CZGS film is replaced by Se in the post-selenized CZGSe film which induces shift in position of diffraction peak towards lower degree 2θ angle in XRD patterns as well as peak shifting in Raman spectra. Hence the shifting of dominant peak position in the XRD patterns and Raman spectra of post-selenized CZGSe films confirms the effective conversion of CZGS to CZGSe films, which is also strongly supported by the EDS analysis of the fabricated films.
 Fig. 5  Comparisons of XRD results (a) and Raman spectra (b) of post-selenized CZGSe films and ternary phase CGSe thin film. Here, dominant XRD peaks of CZGSe (~27.70°) and CGS (~27.96°) appear to be nearly overlapped whereas Raman spectra exhibit CZGSe phase in post-selenized films. 
Furthermore, we also analyzed XRD results of all fabricated films to study the structural parameters of the corresponding crystal. The lattice parameters i.e. a and c were calculated using the relation  for tetragonal unit cell, where d is the lattice plane space and (hkl) the miller indices corresponding to XRD peaks and volume (V = a2c).43Table 3 presents summary of crystal lattice parameters of synthesized CZGS and CZGSe films along with corresponding band gaps estimated from UV-Vis absorption spectra. The calculated crystal lattices for CZGS and CZGSe show close agreement to the summarized values in Table 1 and XRD reference.28 Since the lattice parameters and cell volume of kesterite and stannite are found to be nearly equal, for the crystal structure of CZGS(Se) is rather difficult to confirm whether the crystal structure is either kesterite or stannite. On the basis of the first principles calculation of quaternary chalcogenide semiconductor, Zhang et al.15 have reported some interesting trends for kesterite and stannite structure. It has been claimed that the parameter  has different value with symmetry; <1 for KS structure whereas >1 for ST structure as reported theoretically in Table 1. In our structural analysis, the parameters () for the post-sulfurized CZGS and post-selenized CZGSe films are found to be in close agreement to the kesterite structure. The lattice parameters of as-sprayed CZGS films show higher values than post-sulfurized CZGS films. Even though it is definitely hard to claim its crystal structure due to poor crystallinity and oxygen incorporation, the stannite structure may be dominant in as-sprayed films. In addition, the estimated band gap for post-selenized CZGSe is also found to be in good agreement with the theoretical values for the kesterite structure whereas that of post-sulfurized CZGS films show somewhat lower value of band gap energy than the kesterite structure. This must be due to the facts that the ST and KS are nearly degenerate energetically3 and likely to coexist or phase mixing.10

3.3. Estimation of band gap
In order to estimate the optical band gap of the thin films, we measured the transmittance and reflectance of all fabricated films using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The absorption coefficient, α, is calculated using the relation,44, where t is the thickness of the films fabricated on SLG and T(λ) is the transmittance and R(λ) is the reflectance of the sample. The samples fabricated on SLG are found to be 400–600 nm thick. The absorption coefficients of post-sulfurized CZGS and post-selenized CZGSe sample are found to be above 2 × 104 cm−1 in the visible range. These high absorption coefficient values are suitable for absorber layer in thin film solar cell application. The optical band gap of the sample is determined from the relation αhν = C (hν − Eg)nαhν44 where Eg is the energy band gap, h is the Plank's constant, ν is the frequency of photon and C is a constant. The value of exponent “n” in the above relation depends upon the nature of the optical transition. Since quaternary CZGS is a material of direct band gap nature,10,15 the value of “n” is taken to be 0.5.

Fig. 6 presents the plot of (αhν)2versus hν for as-sprayed CZGS, post-sulfurized CZGS and post-selenized CZGSe films which were grown on SLG substrate. The UV-Vis absorption measurements were carried out after etching the films in KCN solution (10% w/w; de-ionized water) for one minute to remove the CuxSy and CuxSey phases so that its effect on the optical absorption can be minimized.33,45 The optical band gap can be estimated by extrapolating the linear part of curves to intercept on horizontal axis as depicted in Fig. 6. The band gaps for as-sprayed CZGS films are estimated to be ~2.23, 2.22 and 2.12 eV for CP-CZGS, CC-CZGS and CR-CZGS, respectively. The absorption curves in Fig. 6(b) are extrapolated to yield band gaps ~1.89, 1.93 and 1.88 eV, respectively for corresponding post-sulfurized CZGS films. The estimated direct optical band gaps for CZGS films are found to be in the range of the theoretically predicted value of CZGS.15 The higher band gap energy of as-sprayed CZGS films must be due to the included oxygen, the sulfur deficiency and poor crystallinity of the sprayed film in comparison to the post-sulfurized films as revealed by the EDS and XRD results. The band gap energies for post-selenized CZGSe are estimated as 1.41 eV for CP-CZGSe, 1.40 eV for CC-CZGSe and 1.43 eV for CR-CZGSe which are close to the ideal band gap for solar cell absorber.46,47 The values of estimated band gap energies of CZGSe and CZGS films are found to be in close agreement with theoretical reports.10,15 Moreover, the estimated band gaps for CZGS and CZGSe show distinctly different values from those of possible secondary and ternary phases of sulfide and selenide. Some of secondary phases such as CuS(Se) may be removed by KCN etching. Here, no additional features corresponding to secondary and ternary phases were noticed in the absorption plot, which also indicates absence of secondary phases in the fabricated films. The experimental reports3,18–20 for band gap energy of CZGSe and CZGS show overestimation with somewhat variation. This may be due to different fabrication techniques, crystal quality of material and inherent error in the extrapolation. Band gap energy of Cu-based quaternary chalcogenide semiconductors has been systematically studied using first principles calculations.10,15,48 The evolution of band gap energy of chalcogenide is generally explained in terms of consequence of hybridizations in conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM). In CZGS quaternary semiconductor, the CBM contains mainly antibonding state of Ge 4s and S 3p orbitals whereas the VBM is the consequence of hybridization of Cu 3d and S 3p orbitals.10,15,48 The higher band gap energy of as-sprayed CZGS film can be explained by considering electronic interaction between oxygen and cations. Due to co-existence of sulfur and oxygen, the smaller oxygen atom strengthen the s–p level repulsion between Ge and S/O atoms which moves up the anti-bonding CBM state, whereas resultantly increased d–p level repulsion between Cu and S/O atoms lowers VBM state. Therefore the band gap energy of as-sprayed CZGS is found to be higher than post-sulfurized CZGS. This explanation is also supported by the report on effect of oxygen on the band gap energy of β-In2S3−3xO3x thin film deposited by physical vapor deposition.30 Whenever the oxygen atoms are substituted by sulfur atoms during post-sulfurization, the orbital interaction in VBM and CBM is minimized which results in the decrease of the band gap energy of post-sulfurized CZGS films. Herein, post-selenized CZGSe films are observed to have substantially smaller band gaps than the CZGS counterparts. The VBM of CZGSe compound semiconductor is composed of hybridized Cu 3d and Se 4p states so that the shallower atomic level of Se 4p compared to the S 3p states results in higher VBM states which eventually induces a smaller band gap in CZGSe films.15
 Fig. 6  Plot of (αhν)2vs. hν for the estimation of the band gap energy of (a) as-sprayed CZGS (b), post-sulfurized CZGS and (c) post-selenized CZGSe. Here, the band gap energies are estimated as 2.23, 2.22 and 2.12 eV for as-sprayed CZGS from Fig. 6(a); 1.89, 1.93 and 1.88 eV for post-sulfurized CZGS from Fig. 6(b) and 1.41, 1.40 and 1.43 eV for post-selenized CZGSe from Fig. 6(c) where 1st, 2nd and 3rd values correspond to CP, CC and CR thin films of each type, respectively. 
4. Conclusion
Polycrystalline CZGS and CZGSe thin films were successfully synthesized using chemical spray pyrolysis accompanied by sulfurization and selenization in sulfur and selenium vapor ambient. Even though the as-sprayed films were grown to be of poor crystal quality, the post-sulfurized CZGS and post-selenized CZGSe films were observed to be drastically improved in terms of crystallinity with dense morphology and acceptable stoichiometry. The band gap energies of as-sprayed CZGS were measured to be about 2.12–2.23 eV whereas those of post-sulfurized CZGS and post-selenized CZGSe films were determined to be as 1.88–1.93 eV and 1.40–1.43 eV, respectively, which are in the range of optimum band gaps required for solar cell absorber materials. The crystal lattice parameters of post-sulfurized(selenized) CZGS(Se) films extracted from XRD results and band gap energies estimated from UV-Vis spectroscopy strongly support the kesterite crystal structure. Hence Cu2ZnGeSe4 polycrystalline thin films fabricated here demonstrate promising structural and optical properties of absorber layer for solar cell fabrication with ideal band gap energy (Eg ~1.4 eV).
