    , Accepted 31st May 2014First published on 2nd June 2014AbstractTwo symmetrical planar star-shaped organic small molecules, i.e., DMM-TPA[DTS(FBTTh3)3] (1) and TPA[DTS(FBTTh3)3] (2), with fused TPA and TPA core donors, respectively, and three branched DTS(FBTTh3) units were synthesized and characterized. These small molecules were used donor materials along with a PC71BM acceptor for solution-processed bulk heterojunction solar cells. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cells based on 1 and 2 is about 2.87% and 2.51%, respectively, when the active layers were processed from a CB solvent. The higher PCE of the solar cell based on 1 may be attributed to its low bandgap and broad absorption profile as compared to 2. The PCE of the solution-processed SMBHJ solar cells was improved up to 5.16% and 4.70% for 1 and 2, respectively, when the active layers were processed with 4 v% DIO as an additive in the CB solvent. The enhancement in the PCE was mainly due to the increase in Jsc and FF, which is attributed to the balanced charge transport between the electron and hole transport and reduction in the bimolecular recombination, leading to an increase in the PCE.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells based on the bulk heterojunction active layer interpenetrating a network of organic donors and fullerene derivative acceptors have attracted great interest for the conversion of solar energy into electrical energy due to their advantages such as low manufacturing cost through roll-to-roll processing, low weight and high mechanical flexibility.1 Within a decade, the power conversion efficiency of these devices has been improved by three-fold2 and is still improving3 due to a synergetic effort on the development of new donor and acceptor materials.4 In the last few years, there is a dramatic improvement in organic BHJ solar-cell performance with PCE surpassing 10% using low bandgap polymers as donors and fullerene as acceptors.5
Small molecule bulk hetero-junction solar cells (SMBHJ solar cells) offer several advantages over polymer solar cells because of the easier synthesis of small molecules, less batch-to-batch variation and more reproducible performances of solar cells.6 Hence, considerable research effort has been focused on developing efficient small molecule materials for improved photovoltaic performance of the device. Indeed, the highest PCE above than 8% have recently been reported by using solution-processed small molecules,7 thus making them strong competitors for polymer solar cells.
Most of the small molecules as donor materials for photovoltaic applications normally contain four key constituents: donor–acceptor units, conjugated bridges, heteroatom substituents and side chains. The creative design and choice of donor or acceptor units, conjugated bridges and heteroatomic substitutions have been successfully employed to overcome the limitations of unbalanced charge transport and poor film quality of small molecule-based organic solar cells and shown high PCE.8 Among the soluble small molecules, star-shaped molecules have been developed as an interesting class of semiconducting materials and used in organic solar cells because of a number of advantages.9 By tailoring and substituting the functional groups, including donor units, acceptor units, and conjugated bridges, star-shaped small molecules can be designed for low bandgap and stronger and broader absorption together with highly ordered and interconnected domains, resulting in higher PCEs of the organic solar cells.10 Shang et al. have reported a symmetrical star-shaped acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) small molecule composed of a triphenylamine (TPA) core and various acceptors.11 Inspired by their work, we have synthesized star-type small molecules with TPA and DMM–TPA donor cores for organic solar cells and achieved a PCE of 4.16%.12 We have also reported various symmetric and un-symmetric push–pull chromophores for solution-processed small molecule solar cells.13 The use of push–pull-type structures in small molecules enable efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), providing better molar extinction coefficients and low band gap. Moreover, an electron-donating group such as TPA can play an important role in stabilizing the separated hole from an exciton and improving the hole-transporting properties14. Recently, it was reported that a fluorine-substituted benzothiadiazole (BT) unit acts as an effective electron-withdrawing unit and produces a low bandgap semiconducting polymer and affords polymer solar cells with PCEs of 5–7%.15 The fluorine atom often affords unique features such as when used in the BHJ active layer with a fullerene derivative, it boosts the intermolecular charge transfer through C–F⋯H interactions and thus affects the photovoltaic performance of the solar cell. We recently synthesized a novel fluorine-substituted BT as a core linked with an electron donating TPA group through the π-conjugated bi-thiophene bridge-based small molecules, i.e. (bis[TPA-diTh]-MonoF-BT) and (bis[TPA-diTh]-DiF-BT), and used them as electron donors along with the PCBM as an acceptor, and yielded a PCE of 2.95%.16
Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and photovoltaic characteristics of two novel symmetrical planar star-shaped A–D–A organic semiconductors, i.e.DMM-TPA[DTS(FBTTh3)3] (1) and TPA[DTS(FBTTh3)3] (2). Our strategy for choosing a fused amine as a core unit was to increase the lifetime of a charge-separated state by the delocalization of the generated cation over a planar amine, leading to a high Voc. For comparison, we synthesized a triphenyl amine derivative. The second novelty of this work is the comparison of the electron-acceptor moiety and its photovoltaic performance. These two small molecules DMM-TPA[DTS(FBTTh3)3] (1) and TPA[DTS(FBTTh3)3] (2) were employed as donor materials for solution-processed SMBHJ solar cells using PC71BM as an acceptor, yielding PCEs of 2.87% and 2.51%, for 1 and 2, respectively. Moreover, the processing additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) significantly affected the PCE of 1 or 2: PC71BM SMBHJ solar cells, achieving PCEs of 5.16% and 4.70% for 1 and 2, respectively. The enhancement in PCE is mainly due to the higher values of Jsc and FF, attributed to the increased crystallinity of the film and a more balanced charge transport in the device. Therefore, we thought that if the electron acceptor was changed, the PCE would be enhanced. Indeed, the change of electron acceptor to F-substituted unit yielded a considerably improved PCE (5.19%). Incorporation of a long chain donor group in these small molecules gives a panchromatic visible spectrum, which is another unique feature for these materials.

Measurements and instruments

1H NMR, 13C NMR and 19F NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed with a Carlo Elba Instruments CHNS-O EA 1108 analyzer. Mass spectra were recorded on a JEOL JMS-SX102A instrument. The absorption and photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2S UV-visible spectrometer and a Perkin LS fluorescence spectrometer, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out with a BAS 100B (Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.). A three-electrode system was used, which consisted of non-aqueous reference electrode (0.1 M Ag/Ag+ acetonitrile solution; MF-2062, Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.), platinum working electrode (MF-2013, Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.), and a platinum wire (diam. 1.0 mm, 99.9% trace metals basis, Sigma-Aldrich) as the counter electrode. The redox potential of dyes was measured in CH2Cl2 with 0.1 M (n-C4H9)4N-PF6 with a scan rate between 50 mV s−1 (vs. Fc/Fc+).

Device fabrication and characterization
The BHJ organic solar cells were prepared using the indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate as the anode, Al as the cathode and a blended film of donor:PC71BM between the two electrodes as a photoactive layer as follows: firstly, ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and subsequently dried in an oven for 12 h. An aqueous solution of PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus, Clevious P VP, Al 4083) was spin cast on the ITO substrates to obtain a film having a thickness of about 40 nm. The PEDOT:PSS film was then dried for 10 min at a temperature of 120 °C in ambient conditions. Then, a 20 mg mL−1 solution of donor/PC71BM blends in different solvents was prepared with different weight ratios, and subsequently spin cast on the top of PEDOT:PSS layer and dried at 80 °C for 10 min. The solvents included chlorobenzene (CB) and CB containing (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5v%) 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO). The thickness of the photoactive layers is about 100 ± 10 nm. Finally, an ∼90 nm-thick Al electrode was deposited on the top of BHJ film under reduced pressure (<10−6 Torr). All of the devices were fabricated and tested in an ambient atmosphere without encapsulation. The active area of the devices is about 0.20 cm2. The hole-only and electron-only devices, i.e., ITO/PEODT:PSS/donor:PC71BM/Au and Al/donor:PC71BM/Al structures, were fabricated to measure the hole and electron mobility, respectively.
The current–voltage characteristics of the devices were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 238 source meter in darkness as well as under an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. A xenon light source coupled with an AM1.5 optical filter was used as a light source to illuminate the surfaces of the devices. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured by illuminating the device through the light source and monochromator, and the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short-circuit conditions.

Fig. 1a and b show the UV-visible absorption spectra of 1 and 2 in both CB solution and thin-film form. The corresponding optical properties are summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectra of both small molecules exhibited two typical transition bands in the 300–700 nm region. The absorption band in the lower wavelength regions with absorption peaks at 413 nm and 406 nm for 1 and 2, respectively, were assigned to the π–π* transition. The absorption band in longer wavelength region with absorption maxima at wavelengths of 575 nm and 564 nm for 1 and 2, respectively, can be assigned to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition between the donor and acceptor units. The π–π* transition and ICT transition bands of 1 showed a slight redshift as compared to those of the titled star-shaped 2, indicating that the planar structure of 1 results in more efficient ICT, and π–π* transitions and facilitates intermolecular π–π packing interactions more efficiently than the titled star-shaped structure 2. The absorption band in the wavelength range 450–750 nm is attributed to the ICT transition bands between HOMO and LUMO. These bands were further analyzed by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations using the B3LYP functional/6-31G* basis set. Fig. S1 and Table S1† show the calculated energy bands of these materials in vacuo (see the ESI†). In thin films, the absorption bands of 1 and 2 showed a redshift relative to those in solution, whereas the broader spectral bands may be caused by the existence of π-π stacking of the molecules in dense states. As the absorption edges of 1 and 2 are 768 nm and 724 nm, respectively. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) are calculated as 1.61 eV and 1.73 eV for 1 and 2, respectively. Both of the small molecules exhibit a broader absorption range and low bandgap, which would favor light harvesting when used as photoactive layer materials in organic solar cells.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of both small molecules were estimated from the oxidation and reduction onsets, respectively, which were observed in cyclic voltammograms (CV) under the assumption that the energy levels of ferrocene (Fc) was 4.8 eV below the vacuum level, and are listed in Table 1. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of 1 and 2 were calculated as −4.8381/−3.744 eV and −4.8869/−3.471 eV, respectively. The values of the HOMO energy levels of these small molecules are slightly decreased as compared to the small molecules without fluorine-substituted BT,12 indicating that the substitution of electron-withdrawing fluorine in BT decreases the HOMO energy level. Considering that the PC71BM has HOMO and LUMO levels around 6.2 eV and 4.0 eV, respectively, 1 and 2 can be used as donor materials and PC71BM as acceptor material; moreover, their energy levels will be compatible with PC71BM, for efficient exciton dissociation in BHJ organic solar cells.
Theoretical calculations and molecular simulation
The electronic properties of 1 and 2 have also been investigated through theoretical calculations. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the optimized structures of 1 and 2, which were calculated by TD-DFT using the B3LYP functional/6-31G* basis set. The orbital densities of the HOMOs of 1 and 2 were evenly distributed on triarylamine core. However, the orbital densities of the LUMOs and LUMO + 1 of these materials were located on a benzothiadiazole moiety. The calculations revealed that the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the triarylamine core (HOMO state) to the benzothiadiazole core (LUMO and LUMO + 1 state) can effectively occur in 1 and 2 when excited by light energy. The details are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.†
Hole mobility in pristine 1 and 2
Hole mobility is another important parameter of the small molecules for the photovoltaic applications. In this study, we investigated the hole mobility of 1 and 2 by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) model with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1 or 2/Au.17 For the hole-only device, SCLC is expressed as follows:18 (1)where JSCLC stands for current density, d is the thickness of the active layer, and V = Vappl − Vbi, Vbi is the built-in potential. The results are plotted as ln(Jd/V2) versus (V/d) and the hole mobilities are evaluated to be 4.56 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.56 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 2 and 1, respectively. The planar structure of 1 that results in enhanced hole transport via efficient intermolecular π–π packing interactions leads to its higher hole mobility.
Photovoltaic properties
We have explored the photovoltaic properties of the organic solar cells based on two small molecules as electron donors along with PC71BM as acceptor by fabricating BHJ devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1 or 2: PC71BM/Al. PC71BM instead of PC61BM was chosen as the electron acceptor due to its stronger absorption in the visible region. We fabricated the devices with different weight ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:4 and found that the optimized ratio is 1:2. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices with different weight ratios are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). Fig. 2a and b shows the J–V characteristics of optimized devices under stimulated AM1.5 radiation (100 mW cm−2). The BHJ devices based on 1 and 2 small molecules processed from CB showed a PCE of 2.87% (Jsc = 9.18 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.68 V and FF = 0.46) and 2.44% (Jsc = 8.54 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.68 V and FF = 0.42), respectively. The relatively higher value of Jsc and FF for device based on 1 could be attributed to the higher hole mobility due to the efficient intermolecular π–π packing interactions, which are in turn more efficient for the planar core DMM-TPA unit of 1. The value of Voc of the devices based on both small molecules is same, which is consistent with their similar values of the HOMO level, since because the Voc for the BHJ solar cell is the difference between the HOMO level of donor and LUMO level of PC71BM.

The IPCE values of the devices were estimated from the following expression: (2)where Jsc (mA cm−2) is the photocurrent under short-circuit conditions, λ (nm) is the wavelength of monochromatic incident light and Pin (mW cm−2) is the irradiance flux. The IPCE spectra of the devices based on 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The IPCE values are higher, and the spectrum is broader for device based on 1 than that for 2. The higher value of Jsc for the device based on 1 rather than 2 is consistent with the IPCE spectra.

Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy has been used to obtain information about the exciton dissociation efficiency and mixing morphology of the blend-active layer used in the device. The PL spectra of pristine 1 and 2, and their blend with PC71BM are shown in Fig. 4a and b. It can be seen that in the blends the PL intensity is significantly quenched. The PL intensities of the small molecules are quenched 84% and 78% for 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM blends, respectively. Higher PL quenching for 1:PC71BM blend as compared to 2:PC71BM blend indicates that the probability for an exciton to reach the D–A interfaces and exciton dissociation efficiency is less for 2:PC71BM compared to 1:PC71BM. This behavior is correlated with the difference of the IPCE and Jsc values of devices.

The PCE of the BHJ using 1 or 2 as donor and PC71BM as an acceptor is low and may be due to the low FF and Jsc. These two photovoltaic parameters depend upon the nanoscale morphology of the active layer and balanced charge transport in the devices. Various processing techniques have been developed in order to optimize the nanoscale morphology of the BHJ active layer to improve the PCE of organic solar cells, including thermal annealing,19 solvent annealing20 and spontaneous inter-diffusion of bi-layer heterojunction.21 In addition to abovementioned processing methods, the use of solvent additives was recently employed to enhance the photovoltaic performance of BHJ organic solar cells.22 This technique is very useful to control the morphology of BHJ active layers, in which thermal annealing is undesirable or ineffective. It has been reported that the morphology of an active layer can be controlled by incorporating a small percentage of solvent additives to the blend solution and is an effective approach to improve the PCE of the organic solar cells based on several polymeric donors.23 It was reported that the solvent additives also improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells with solution-processed small molecules.6a,24 Solvent additives (usually with poor solubility and high boiling points) allow the polymer chains to aggregate easily, whereas the main solvent is evaporated during the film formation using the spin-coating technique and thus facilitate the crystallization process. It was reported that in small-molecule BHJ systems, the main function of the DIO additive is to affect the nanoscale morphology.25 The enhancement in the PCEs has been ascribed to the controlling of crystallization behaviour of the donor materials within the blend films, resulting in optimized domain sizes.
In organic SMBHJ solar cells, after the absorption of photons from incident light, excitons are generated either in donors or acceptors or in both, and then diffuse towards the donor–acceptor interface where ultra-fast photoinduced charge transfer occurs, thereby generating free holes and electrons in donor and acceptor phases, respectively. These free charge carriers are swept out by internal built-in fields towards the electrodes. During this process, the collection of the charge carriers by the electrodes must be fast; otherwise, recombination might take place within the active layer.26
To improve the PCE organic devices based on 1 and 2, we have used 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive. We varied the concentration of DIO in the solvent from 1% to 5% by volume and found that the optimized concentration was about 4% by volume (the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S3, ESI†). When the concentration increased beyond 4 v%, the PCE of the solar cell decreases, which may be due to over-aggregation of the donor phase, which disturbs the percolating pathways of the acceptor phase and reduces electron mobility in the BHJ active layer. The over-aggregation of the donor phase may also reduce the effective interfacial area for charge separation and consequently reduces the photocurrent generation.25 The reduction in PCE may also be attributed to the incomplete drying of the active layer due to the high boiling point of DIO. Therefore, we have discussed the effect of a solvent additive on the photovoltaic performance of the devices, only for the 4% DIO by volume in CB. The J–V characteristic of the devices processed with DIO/DCB under illumination are shown in Fig. 2a and b, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 2. The PCE of the devices for 1 and 2 have been significantly enhanced up to 5.16% and 4.70%, respectively. The increase in the PCE upon the addition of DIO arises from the enhancement in FF and Jsc.

The FF of the SMBHJ solar cells cast without additive is low, which may be due to the buildup of the space charge due to the imbalance in the hole and electron transport in the device.27 Although under short circuit conditions, the charge transport may not limit extraction, a reduced hole or electron mobility may lead to a buildup of space charge within the devices and increased bimolecular recombination at low internal fields, leading to the poor FF. To get information about charge transport, we have measured the hole and electron mobilities in each blend using single-carrier diodes using charge-selective contacts.28 Hole-only devices were fabricated for different blends of the solar cells with structures ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1 or 2:PC71BM (processed with CB or DIO/CB solvent/Au). Au was selected because its work function is sufficiently deep to prevent the injection of electrons into the LUMO of PC71BM.29 The electron-only devices were fabricated with the structure Al/1 or 2:PC71BM/Al. The hole mobilities of 1 and 2 in the blend films with and without the DIO additive extracted from the space charge-limited current (SCLC) obtained in darkness for hole-only devices using Fig. 5b and show the dark J–V characteristics of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1:PC71BM processed with and without DIO/Au. Similar results have been observed for devices based on 2:PC71BM blends. To estimate the hole and electron mobilities in the blend with and without the DIO additive, the J–V characteristics of the respective devices were fitted to the SCLC as described in eqn (1). The hole mobilities extracted from the J–V characteristics for the blends cast without and with DIO are 4.78 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 1 and 3.21 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 2, and 5.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 1 and 1.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 2, respectively. The increase in the hole mobility with the DIO additive agrees with the results revealed by the morphology change, in which the domain size and crystallinity increases with the addition of DIO in the solvent. The electron mobilities (estimated from Fig. 5b) of the blend films processed with CB and DIO (4 v%)/CB are quite similar, 3.4 × 10−4 and 2.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for both 1 and 2, respectively. The electron and hole mobilities are more balanced in the BHJ active layer processed with DIO/CB solvent. The more balanced charge transports may be one of the possible reasons that contribute to the higher Jsc and FF, thereby resulting in enhanced IPCE and PCE of the DIO/DCB-processed devices.

The FF of the BHJ organic solar cells depends upon the charge recombination that occurred within the devices.30 To obtain information about the effect of the DIO additive on the charge recombination and photoinduced carrier generation rates, we have plotted the photocurrent (Jph = Jlight − Jdark) against the effective internal voltage Vin, i.e., (Vo − Vappl), where Vo is the voltage when photocurrent is zero (as shown in Fig. 6). This effective voltage determines the strength of the electrical field within the device and thus the driving force for charge extraction.31 As shown in Fig. 6, Jph increases linearly at low Vin, and saturates at high voltage around 2.2 V and greater. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the photocurrent in the BHJ device processed with the DIO additive quickly saturates at a low effective voltage of about 0.8 V. This indicates that the charge generation and extraction processes are relatively independent of the electrical field. In contrast, the photocurrent in the devices cast from CB only does not even begin to saturate, even up to 2.2 V. This indicates that in the device cast from the CB, the formation of space charge limits the charge extraction. For this device limited by the insufficient extraction, the high densities of charges lead to significantly increased bimolecular recombination and thus low FF.

The morphology of the photoactive blend film has a significant influence on the charge separation and transport in the device, and this is investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode. The AFM images of the 1: PC71BM blend films processed from CB and DIO/CB solvent are shown in Fig. 7. Similar AFM images have been observed for 2:PC71BM blends. It can be seen from the AFM images (Fig. 7) that the blend film processed with CB shows that 1 and PC71BM are homogeneously mixed, and the surface is very smooth (with a surface roughness of 0.42 nm) and does not show any significant phase separation; moreover, its domain size about 2–3 nm. These negligible domain sizes lead to reduced performance because of increased recombination. The addition of 4 v% of DIO in the solvent shows significant change in the morphology of the blend film (with a surface roughness of 2.18 nm). The observed domain size is about 15–25 nm. The more coarse film is indicative of a more highly ordered structure, which indicates a more efficient charge separation in the OSC.32,33 Moreover, the electron and hole mobilities are more balanced in the film processed with 4 v% DIO/CB.33 The effectiveness of DIO may be linked with its ability to selectively dissolve PC71BM aggregates in solution.34 Domains larger than ∼20 nm are generally are not beneficial to device performance as the limited exciton diffusion length of most of the organic semiconductors is about 10–15 nm and requires domains of the 10–15 nm for efficient exciton dissociation.35
 Fig. 7  AFM images of 1:PC71BM films processed with and without DIO additives. 
As shown in Fig. 8, the XRD profile of the 1: PC71BM film processed without DIO shows only one broad band (weak) centered at 2θ = 4.15°, whereas the film processed with 4 v% DIO/CB shows a sharp peak at 2θ = 4.15° and higher order reflections at 2θ = 8.35° and 2θ = 12.18°, indicating that the film processed with DIO/CB solvent has higher crystallinity. The decrease in d-spacing (estimated from the XRD peak around 2θ = 4.15° is about 2.346 nm and 2.224 nm for CB and DIO/CB processed film, respectively) indicates that the interlayer interaction become stronger. The DIO additive substantively increases the intermolecular π–π packing interactions in the semiconducting small molecules in the BHJ film compared to film without the solvent additive, inducing more phase-separated morphology as observed in AFM images.

The series resistance (Rs) represents the total resistance of the bulk active layer as well as contact resistance, whereas the shunt resistance (Rsh) is related to leakage current across the device. The reverse saturation current density (Jo) in the device is the minority charge carrier (hole) density, which gives the qualitative measure of the electron–hole recombination at D–A interfaces or BHJ/Al interfaces.36 In the device based on solvent additives, both the Rs and Rsh decrease. The reduction in Rs is most likely due to the increased formation of crystalline zones and enhanced molecular ordering, which consequently contributes to an increase in carrier mobility or improved charge extraction.
The value of Voc in the SMBHJ solar cells was slightly reduced with the incorporation of the DIO additive. The Voc of the SMBHJ solar cells depends on the energy offset between the HOMO of the donor and LUMO of the acceptor,37 the difference in the work functions of the electrodes from metal–insulator–metal model38 and the influence of surface dipoles.39,40 The reduction in the Voc has been commonly observed in polymer solar cells after thermal annealing and solvent annealing, attributed to the improved crystalline ordering of the polymer chain and molecular ordering,40 leading to the reduction of the HOMO level of polymer. Therefore, we assume that the decrease in Voc with the incorporation of DIO leads to improved crystallization of the donor phase. The high boiling point of DIO and the poor solubility of PC71BM in DIO play important roles in the crystallization of the donor phase.
To obtain information about the effect of DIO on the operation of these devices, we have studied the recombination mechanisms in the devices using the light-intensity dependence of J–V characteristics under different illumination intensities from 1 mW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2, and then extract the values of Jsc. The variation of Jsc with illumination intensity in the log–log scale and fitted to power law is shown in Fig. 9. In most of the organic solar cells, a power-law dependence was observed, i.e. Jsc ∝ Pinα. The exponential factor α = 1 is indicative of an efficient sweep-out of the charge carriers prior to recombination.41 We have estimated the value of the exponential factor (α) for the devices processed with and without DIO as 0.937 and 0.898, respectively. The value of α for the device processed from the DIO is closer to unity, which indicates that the sweep-out of the charge carrier is more effective. This is consistent with the balanced charge transport as observed from the mobility measurements. The increased deviation from α = 1 in the device processed with CB only suggests that the bimolecular recombination is more important in this device. An unbalanced hole and electron mobility in this device can also be attributed to the deviation of α value from unity.

Conclusions
We have synthesized two symmetrical planar star-shaped small molecules, i.e., DMM-TPA[DTS(FBTTh3)3] (1) and TPA[DTS(FBTTh3)3] (2), and investigated them as donor materials along with PC71BM as an acceptor for the fabrication of solution-processed BHJ organic solar cells. The solar cells based on 1 and 2 showed PCEs of 2.87 and 2.51%, respectively. The higher PCE for the device based on 1 as compared to 2 attributed to lower bandgap and the higher hole mobility of 1 as compared to 2. We have further investigated the influence of the solvent additive (DIO) on the photovoltaic performance of the organic solar cells based on these two small molecules. We found that the PCE of the devices is significantly enhanced for the devices when a solvent additive (4% by volume) is used for film processing, resulting in overall PCEs of 5.16% and 4.70% for 1 and 2, respectively. We found that the active layer processed from CB only showed poor phase separation, due to the higher recombination and unbalanced charge transport, leading to both lower Jsc and FF. However, the device processed with 4 v% DIO yields favorable nanoscale morphology, in which phase separation sufficiently created a percolating pathway for charge transport. The enhancement in the hole mobility for DIO/CB-processed active layer also indicates a balanced charge transport in the devices, resulting in higher Jsc, FF and PCE.
