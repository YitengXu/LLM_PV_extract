    , Accepted 31st March 2020First published on 9th April 2020AbstractThe face-to-face contact of a vertical heterojunction is beneficial to charge interaction in photocatalysis. However, constructing a vertical heterojunction with uncompromised redox ability still remains a challenge. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a WO3–TiO2 vertical heterojunction via establishing an internal electric field across the interface. Experimental investigation and computational simulations reveal that strong electric coupling occurs at the WO3–TiO2 interface forming an internal electric field. The internal electric field induces a Z-scheme charge-carrier transfer through the heterojunction under light irradiation, which leads to effective charge separation and maintains high reaction potentials of charge-carriers. The improved photocatalytic activity of the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction is proved by enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species and accelerated Escherichia coli (E. coli) disinfection. This study provides new insights into understanding and designing Z-scheme heterogeneous photocatalysts.
1. Introduction
Photocatalysis has provided new opportunities for addressing the increasingly serious energy crisis and environmental problems.1,2 Unfortunately, the performance of photocatalysts is far from satisfactory owing to the high recombination rate of photogenerated charge-carriers.3,4 Establishing heterostructures is an attractive strategy to overcome this limitation because of the synergistic effects and promoted charge separation.2,5,6 Furthermore, the rising of heterogeneous photocatalysts puts forward the importance of interfacial engineering.7,8 A vertical heterostructure with a face-to-face interface is desirable to implement efficient charge transfer due to an enlarged and intimate contact.9–11 In addition, the building blocks of vertical heterojunctions, two-dimensional (2D) sheets, show a specific third-dimension confinement effect which boosts the photon-excitation conversion rate and shortens the diffusion distance of photogenerated charges.12 Particularly, anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanosheets, synthesized by surface control growth, show excellent photocatalytic performance, because of their structure superiority and exposed highly energetic {001} facets.13 Nonetheless, their narrow light response and rapid recombination of photoinduced charges impede their photocatalytic efficiency.14,15 Given the problem, tungsten trioxide (WO3) with excellent visible light sensitivity and appropriate band positions is an ideal choice for constructing vertical heterojunctions with TiO2 nanosheets.16,17
Unfortunately, the photogenerated charge-carriers transfer to weak reduction and oxidation bands in conventional Type-II heterojunctions, leading to reduction in the redox capacity.18,19 Mimicking natural photosystems, artificial Z-scheme photocatalytic systems have attracted increasing attention because they tackle the deficiency of conventional Type-II heterojunctions.20,21 In a Z-scheme system, the staggered band structures encourage the spatial isolation of reduction and oxidation sites. More importantly, the combination of photoexcited charges at low energy levels retains electrons and holes with stronger redox ability, which consequently contributes to enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.22,23 In traditional Z-scheme photocatalysts, electrons are mediated by ion pairs or conductors.24 The concept of direct Z-scheme heterojunction was first proposed by Yu's group to remedy the disadvantages of traditional Z-scheme photocatalysts, e.g. photocorrosion and shielding effects.25 They attribute the intrinsic cause of Z-scheme mechanism to the creation of an internal electric field.22,26 Inspired by the promising characteristics, many direct Z-scheme photocatalysts such as ZnO/CdS,27 g-C3N4/Ag3PO4,28 CdS/polyimide29 and g-C3N4/UiO-6630 have been synthesized. However, constructing Z-scheme charge transfer pathways across a vertical heterojunction still remains a challenge. Additionally, a systemic study on electron transfer through a face-to-face interface is necessary to gain a better understanding of the Z-scheme mechanism.
In this work, we develop a Z-scheme photocatalysis system with face-to-face contact via in situ assembling of WO3 nanosheets on TiO2 nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 1a. First, WO42− ions are adsorbed onto TiO2 nanosheets by the electrostatic interaction, and then they are in situ hydrolyzed to H2WO4 nanosheets at pH = 2. The H2WO4 sheets are dehydrated to WO3 during the hydrothermal treatment forming a WO3–TiO2 vertical heterojunction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed and the results revealed the formation of an internal electric field between TiO2 and WO3, which was further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) simulations. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), surface redox sites and photocatalytic charge migration of the heterojunction were also investigated systematically. The results showed that the internal electric field consequently triggers the Z-scheme charge-carrier transfer between WO3 and TiO2 under solar irradiation. WO3–TiO2 exhibits improved antibacterial activity, which is attributed to enhanced charge separation and radical production ability. The present study gains a deep understanding of Z-scheme heterojunctions and provides an effective strategy for designing novel photocatalysts for efficient solar energy conversion and energy-smart environmental remediation.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of TiO2 nanosheets and a WO3–TiO2 heterojunction
TiO2 nanosheets were synthesized using hydrofluoric acid (HF) (caution, HF is highly corrosive) as the shape control agent according to previous reports.31,32 In detail, 50 g of titanium(IV) butoxide (reagent grade, 97%) was mixed with 16 mL of HF solution under stirring, after which the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and kept at 200 °C for 24 h. Then, the samples were washed several times with water and ethanol and dried in an oven at 60 °C. The fluorine ions adsorbed onto TiO2 were removed by heating in a furnace at 550 °C for 2 h.
Typically, 20 mg of TiO2 was weighted and thoroughly dispersed in 20 mL of water under ultrasonication. Afterwards, 0.6 mL of Na2WO4 solution (0.5 M) was added to the suspension before the pH was adjusted to 2 by adding hydrochloride acid solution. The mixture was kept stirring overnight until the colour changed to light yellow and was subsequently sealed in a Teflon autoclave for hydrothermal treatment. The hydrothermal reaction time and temperature were adjusted to obtain diverse tungsten phases and sizes. The obtained suspension was washed for several cycles with water followed by freeze-drying to obtain the final products. Pure WO3 was synthesized following the same route in the absence of TiO2 nanosheets.
2.2. Characterization
The crystal phases of samples were confirmed using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Miniflex 600) equipped with Cu Kα1 radiation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were recorded on an FTIR spectrometer (PerkinElmer, USA). The Raman spectra of the photocatalysts were recorded on a Renishaw spectrometer at a laser wavelength of 514 nm. XPS testing was carried out using AXIS Nova and AXIS Ultra-DLD spectrometers (Kratos Analytical Inc., Manchester, UK) equipped with a monochromated Al Kα source with a power of 180 W (15 kV × 12 mA). More details about XPS could be found in a specific section of the ESI.† Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Magellan 400 and Nova NanoSEM 450, FEI) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Tecnai F20, FEI) were performed at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV to characterize the morphologies and crystal structures of samples. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained using a UV-2600 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) with BaSO4 as the reference standard. Photoluminescence emission spectra were recorded on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi, Japan).
2.3. Computational details
Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations were carried out under the scheme of generalized gradient approximation33 using the PBE functional34 and the double numerical polarized basis set, as embedded in DMol3 package.35,36 Due to the larger size of the supercell, the k-space was sampled with a grid of 3 × 3 × 1. Geometry optimizations were carried out with the force converged to 0.05 eV Å−1 and energy to 10−4 eV. The TiO2–WO3 structure was modelled with the TiO2(001) and WO3(001) slabs, connecting with one interfacial oxygen-layer. Given a small lattice mismatch of 2.3%, using WO3(001) as the reference phase, the geometric mean (aTiO2 × aWO3)1/2 has been employed for the hybrid one, and the strain energy determined based on this assumption is less than 0.03 eV Å−1 according to our tests. To minimize the effect of dangling bonds, lowly coordinated Ti, O and W were removed from the surface and the interface, leading to a junction with (TiO2)20 and (WO3)8 supercell. The structure has been fully relaxed without fixing any atoms. Frontier orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) were calculated based on the optimized structures at the gamma point. Charge analysis was based on Mulliken population.
2.4. Measurement of ROS and effective ROS identification
Three kinds of main ROS (˙O2−, ˙OH and H2O2) were detected via either fluorescence or coloration methods. ˙O2− was monitored photometrically by absorbance at 470 nm in the presence of 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide sodium salt (XTT, Sigma-Aldrich).37 ˙OH was captured with terephthalic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and then examined by a fluorescence method with an excitation wavelength of 315 nm.38 The indicator of H2O2 was a color complex that can be analyzed spectrophotometrically at 454 nm.38 A bright yellow complex (Cu+–neocuproine) is a reduction product of copper(II) by H2O2 in the presence of neocuproine.38
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis was performed using a Jeol FA 200 EPR spectrometer in the presence of 10 mM 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolidine N-oxide (DMPO) that acts as the spin trapper. A 300 W xenon lamp was utilized as the light source.
Scavenger experiments were carried out by adding the respective trapping reagent of ROS to the photocatalytic reaction medium. Specifically, 0.5 mM isopropanol was added to capture hydroxyl radicals. 4-Hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPOL) with a concentration of 0.2 mM was employed as ˙O2− scavenger and the influence of hydrogen peroxide was eliminated by using the newly prepared ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)–Fe(II) solution (0.5 mM).
2.5. Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI66E, USA) with 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH = 7) as the electrolyte, and saturated Ag/AgCl and Pt as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The working electrode was prepared by coating a layer of catalyst (0.1 mg within 2 × 1 cm2) on fluorine tin oxide glass. The photocurrent was tested at a bias voltage of 1.2 V.
2.6. Selective photoreduction and oxidation reactions
For conducting photodeposition experiments, 10 mg of WO3–TiO2 powder and 1 mL of 1 mM AgNO3 or 5 mM Mn(NO3)2 solution were mixed in 10 mL of deionized water. The suspension was irradiated with simulated solar light for 1 h with stirring. The light source employed was a 150 W xenon arc lamp (Newport 69912, Universal Arc Lamp) equipped with a 1.5 AM filter. The light intensity was fixed at 609 W m−2. The samples after irradiation were collected by centrifugation.
2.7. Photocatalytic disinfection and microscopic images of bacteria

Escherichia coli (E. coli ATCC 11775) was used as the model bacterium to investigate the photocatalytic activity of nanomaterials. In a typical bacteria culture process, E. coli colony was cultured in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth until the optical density (OD) reached 0.5 at 600 nm. Bacterial pellets were then harvested by centrifugation and washed with PBS before being re-suspended to the final density of 103 CFU (colony forming units) per mL. The reaction medium containing E. coli and photocatalysts (0.1 mg mL−1) was exposed under the same illumination conditions as in photodeposition experiments. The solution was withdrawn during certain time intervals and spread onto LB Agar plates for incubation, after which the ratio of viable cells was determined. All the E. coli spreading and culture processes were performed in quintuplicate.
The E. coli samples before and after photocatalytic reactions were pre-fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution for 2 h before being treated with 1% osmium tetroxide. The fixed cells were thoroughly washed with Milli-Q water and then dehydrated in ethanol of various concentrations (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%). The samples were embedded in LR white resin by polymerization at 60 °C for 60 h. After being cut into 100 nm thick sections and further stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate solution, the ultrathin sections containing cells were ready for TEM characterization (Jeol 1400Plus). For SEM samples, the dehydrated E. coli was attached on a glass slide with a polyethylenimine coating layer. The samples were afterwards rinsed with a graded series of hexamethyldisilazane (50%, 66.7%, 100% and 100% in ethanol). The gold coated specimens were examined by SEM (Nova NanoSEM, FEI).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction
As shown in the TEM image of Fig. S4,† the TiO2 synthesized via growth control presents a typical 2D morphology. The transparent feature under electron beam indicates that it is ultrathin. Backscattered electron SEM (BSE-SEM) was employed to analyze the microstructure of the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction. Fig. 2a shows that WO3 nanosheets have been formed and grafted on the lateral surface of TiO2. The well-defined interface between TiO2 and WO3 (Fig. 2b) proves the successful construction of face-to-face contact. The cross-sectional TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) characterization of the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction (Fig. 2c and d) further confirmed the sheet-like morphology of components and their intimate contact consisting of the anatase-{001}TiO2 and monoclinic-{002}WO3 planes.32,39 High-angle annular dark field (HAADF) image (Fig. 2e) and TEM energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping images (Fig. 2f) reveal the distinct distribution of W and Ti elements at the interface. The TEM characterization of the lateral surface of WO3–TiO2 (Fig. S5†) also shows the typical face-to-face stacking of WO3 and TiO2 sheets.

To understand the formation of WO3 nanosheets on TiO2, the products synthesized under various conditions were characterized. When the pH of the TiO2 suspension was adjusted to 2 by adding hydrochloride acid, TiO2 nanosheets became positively charged with a zeta potential of +21.9 mV (Table S4†). As a result, WO42− ions were captured on the surface of TiO2 nanosheets by the electrostatic interaction, and then they were hydrolyzed to H2WO4 crystals (Fig. S6a†). SEM images (Fig. S6b†) show that the H2WO4 crystals have already presented 2D morphology after the hydrolysis step. The H2WO4 nanosheets were in situ converted into WO3 during the hydrothermal treatment (Fig. S6a and c†). In contrast, the obtained WO3 in the absence of TiO2 nanosheets during the synthesis presents bulk morphology (Fig. S7†), corroborating the roles of TiO2 nanosheets as nucleation platforms and growth templates for WO3 nanosheets.
It is worth noting that fewer H2WO4 crystals were formed on TiO2 when the hydrolysis time was shortened to 1 h (Fig. S8†). This indicates that sufficient hydrolysis time is essential, which ensures abundant WO42− adsorption on TiO2 and hydrolysis into 2D H2WO4 crystals. The SEM and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization of WO3–TiO2 synthesized under different hydrothermal temperatures and times (Fig. S9–S14†) revealed that promptly completed transformation of H2WO4 at high temperature could confine the sizes of the resultant WO3 nanosheets. Due to better interfacial contact and size-confinement effects of thinner sheets,40 the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction hydrothermally treated at 210 °C for 1 h was used in the following photocatalytic mechanism studies and antibacterial experiments.
XRD, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy were performed to investigate the phases and chemical structures of the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction. TiO2 nanosheets and WO3 synthesized without TiO2 were also characterized for comparison. In Fig. 3a, the XRD pattern of TiO2 indicates the formation of the anatase phase with dominant peaks at 2θ of 25.4°, 38.1°, 48.1°, 53.6°, 55.1° and 62.7° (JCPDS no. 21-1272) which could be assigned to the {101}, {004}, {200}, {105}, {211} and {204} facets.31 The peaks of WO3 located at 23.2°, 23.7°, 24.5°, 26.7°, 28.7°, 33.3°, and 34.2° correspond to the {001}, {020}, {200}, {120}, {111}, {022}, and {220} facets of the monoclinic phase (JCPDS no. 43-1035).39 WO3–TiO2 holds all the peaks of the anatase TiO2 and monoclinic WO3, indicating that it is a composite of both phases. In addition, the characteristic peaks of WO3 and TiO2 could also be identified in the Raman and FTIR spectra of WO3–TiO2 (Fig. S15†).

(e) Density of States (DOS) of WO3 and TiO2. The interband states are highlighted by the blue rectangle. (f) Schematic of the internal electric field between TiO2 and WO3. 
The existence of related elements (W, Ti and O) in WO3–TiO2 is confirmed by XPS (Fig. S16 and Table S5†). The weight ratio of WO3 and TiO2 in the heterojunction is estimated to be 1.50 based on the elemental analysis. In high-resolution XPS spectra, the Ti 2p peaks positively shifted by 0.9 eV after WO3 nanosheets were assembled on TiO2 (Fig. 3b and Table S1†). In contrast, compared with the W 4f doublet peaks in pure WO3, the characteristic peaks of W 4f in WO3–TiO2 show a reduction of 0.06 eV in the binding energy (Fig. 3c and Table S1†). The shift of Ti 2p peaks in the heterojunction towards higher binding energy suggests a decreased electron density in TiO2. Meanwhile, the W 4f peaks moving to the lower binding energy position indicate the accumulation of electrons in the WO3 side.22 These results reveal that TiO2 donates electrons to WO3 in the heterojunction, which can also be supported by the higher fraction of W5+ (W6+ + e− → W5+) in WO3–TiO2 compared with the bare WO3 (Fig. S17 and Table S3†).
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to better understand the charge interaction at the interface. The planar average electrostatic potential along the c-axis of the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction (Fig. 3d) shows the equilibrated Fermi levels of TiO2 and WO3 when the heterojunction is formed.41,42 In detail, electrons move to WO3 with a lower Fermi energy level from TiO2 with a higher Fermi energy level until an equilibration is achieved. Moreover, the new inter-band states (labelled as the blue rectangle) in WO3, originating from the electric coupling can be observed from the Density of State (DOS) profile (Fig. 3e). The inter-band states are separated from the conduction band (CB) of WO3 and slightly lower as an occupied state of CB, which suggests electron accumulation and band gap narrowing of WO3 in the heterojunction.43 The electron transfer between the two components causes WO3 to become more negatively charged and TiO2 to gather positive charges at the interface. The charge redistribution leads to the establishment of an internal electric field at the interface with the direction from TiO2 to WO3 (Fig. 3f), which determines the direction of photogenerated charge migration in photocatalysis and boosts electron–hole separation.26
3.2. Z-scheme photocatalytic charge transportation route
The WO3–TiO2 heterojunction shows promoted photocurrent intensity compared to WO3 and TiO2 alone (Fig. 4a), which indicates more effective charge excitation and transfer.44 Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) Nyquist plots confirm enhanced charge diffusion dynamics of the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction since the smaller arc radius implies lower electron transfer resistance (Fig. 4b).45,46 Moreover, the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction shows a photoluminescence (PL) quenching compared to TiO2 and WO3 alone (Fig. 4c), indicative of the inhibited charge recombination over the heterojunction.45 Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the vertical heterojunction encourages charge separation and prolongs the lifetime of photoexcited charge-carriers for surface redox reactions.

Detection of (d) H2O2; (e) ˙OH (the value for WO3 is amplified by five times.) and (f) ˙O2− species in WO3, TiO2 and WO3–TiO2 slurries under simulated solar light illumination. 
The formation of ROS on the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction, including H2O2, ˙OH and ˙O2−, was monitored by adding the corresponding chemical probes to understand the transfer route of charge-carriers. The WO3–TiO2 photocatalytic system shows significantly faster accumulation of H2O2 and ˙OH compared with TiO2 and WO3 alone (Fig. 4d and e). The WO3–TiO2 heterojunction also performs more actively than TiO2 and WO3 alone in terms of ˙O2− generation (Fig. 4f). Notably, no ˙O2− signal is detected in the presence of WO3 alone, which suggests its weak reduction ability. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was used to detect the generated ROS (Fig. S18†) and the results are consistent with those of the ROS chemical probing experiments.
It is well accepted that ˙O2− and ˙OH are generated through surface reduction (O2 + e− → ˙O2−) and oxidation (OH− + h+ → ˙OH) on photocatalysts, respectively.47,48 Regarding H2O2, there are two possible generation pathways: two-electron reduction of O2 (O2 + 2e− + 2H+ → H2O2) or combination of ˙OH (˙OH + ˙OH → H2O2).49,50 A significant decline of H2O2 production was observed when oxygen was pre-eliminated from the reaction solution via N2 purging (Fig. S19†). In addition, when isopropanol was added to block ˙OH combination by quenching ˙OH in the reaction medium, H2O2 production did not decrease, but increased slightly. This suggests that two-electron oxygen reduction, rather than ˙OH combination, is the major pathway for H2O2 generation.
DRS (Fig. S20†) and Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. S21†) were used to analyze the band edges of TiO2 and WO3. As shown in the illustrative diagram of Fig. 5a and Table S6,† the band positions of TiO2 (ECB is −0.46 eV and EVB is +2.79 eV vs. NHE) are sufficient to form ˙O2− (˙O2−/O2 −0.33 eV vs. NHE) and ˙OH (˙OH/OH− +2.27 eV vs. NHE).51,52 As for WO3, ˙OH could still be generated because of the adequately positive VB potential at +3.38 eV. However, on account of its relatively low CB value of +0.79 eV, WO3 is not eligible to drive one-electron O2 reduction forming ˙O2−. The analysis of the band potentials of TiO2 and WO3 is consistent with the results of the ROS probing experiment (Fig. 4e and f) where both ˙OH and ˙O2− could be detected in the TiO2 system whereas no ˙O2− is found with WO3 alone. Notably, in Fig. 4d–f, WO3–TiO2 shows higher H2O2, ˙OH and ˙O2− signals than WO3 and TiO2 alone, demonstrating that the heterojunction possesses both the strong oxidation ability of WO3 and the reduction capacity of TiO2.

(b) Secondary electron and (c) backscattered electron SEM images of the WO3–TiO2 photocatalyst with Ag particles loaded by photodeposition. (d) TEM and (e) EDX mapping images of WO3–TiO2 after photodeposition of MnOx. High-resolution XPS fitting spectra of W 4f for (f) WO3 and (g) WO3–TiO2 without and with in situ UV light irradiation. The increase in %area of W5+ doublet with irradiation higher for WO3 than for WO3–TiO2 (see Table 1). 
This indicates that a Z-scheme photocatalytic charge transfer route is formed in the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction. When WO3 and TiO2 are coupled to the heterojunction, the intimate interfacial contact leads to stronger charge interaction. Due to the Fermi level difference,42 WO3 extracts electrons and TiO2 suffers from a loss of electrons, resulting in an electric field with the direction toward WO3 (Fig. 3f). Once excited by photons, the photogenerated electrons and holes in both WO3 and TiO2 leap to the corresponding band positions. The close face-to-face contact renders an efficient charge-carrier transfer through the WO3–TiO2 interface. Moreover, driven by the internal electric field across the heterojunction, electrons in the weak CB of WO3 flow to the VB of TiO2, electrostatically combining with photoexcited holes within TiO2.26 The Z-scheme charge transfer route enables the spatial separation of the remaining electrons in TiO2 and holes in WO3 with strong redox potentials. As a result, the remaining electrons are accumulated in the CB of TiO2 which is negative enough to produce ˙O2− and H2O2, and the holes in the VB of WO3 which exhibit stronger photooxidation ability to facilitate water oxidation forming ˙OH. The investigation of surface redox reactions proves the formation of a Z-scheme heterojunction rather than the traditional Type-II one. If the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction follows the Type-II mechanism, electrons will transfer from the CB of TiO2 to the CB position of WO3. Considering the lower reduction potential of WO3 than that of ˙O2−/O2, ˙O2− generation by WO3–TiO2 should be thermodynamically unfavored, which is not consistent with the experimental data of surface redox reactions.
To visually disclose the spatially separated accumulation of photogenerated electrons and holes that follow a Z-scheme mode, photoreduction (Ag+ + e− → Ag) (Fig. 5b and c) and oxidation (Mn2+ + h+ + OH− → MnOx) (Fig. 5d and e) on WO3–TiO2 were performed in AgNO3 and Mn(NO3)2 solutions respectively.53,54 The anchoring of Ag particles mainly on TiO2 sheets demonstrates the accumulation of electrons on TiO2 which serves as reduction sites in photocatalytic reactions. In addition, the selective photodeposition of MnOx on WO3 sheets suggests the accumulation of holes on WO3 and its role as oxidation sites. Furthermore, following the Z-scheme pathway, the photogenerated electrons in WO3 tend to annihilate with the holes in TiO2, which stops the tendency of W6+ reduction to W5+. Thus, an in situ irradiated XPS analysis was performed to compare the changes of W5+ in WO3 and WO3–TiO2 under light irradiation (Fig. 5f and g and Table 1). Although the amount of W5+ in both WO3 and WO3–TiO2 increases under light irradiation, the percentage increase of W5+ is lower in WO3–TiO2. Evidenced by the enhanced photocurrent (Fig. 4a), more photogenerated electrons are available in WO3–TiO2 than WO3 alone under light irradiation.44 If the photogenerated electrons are transported to WO3via the Type-II mechanism, a larger quantity increase in W5+ should be detected in WO3–TiO2. The relatively decreased formation of W5+ in in situ irradiated WO3–TiO2 (Table 1 and Table S3†) provides additional evidence that most of the photogenerated electrons are transferred to TiO2via the Z-scheme pathway.

3.3. Photocatalytic antibacterial performance
The photocatalytic efficiency of the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction was evaluated with E. coli, a common waterborne bacterium, as the target contamination under simulated sunlight, as shown in Fig. 6a. A light control experiment without a photocatalyst was conducted, during which the bacterial population only declined slightly, suggesting solar light is of little account for inactivation. In the dark control group, the bacterial survival rate remained above 80%, indicating the low toxic effects of WO3–TiO2. Under simulated solar light, the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction exhibited a rapid bactericidal activity with 95.3% of E. coli cells disinfected within 80 min treatment (Fig. 6b), while for WO3 and TiO2 alone, only 33.6% and 60.2% of bacteria were inactivated, respectively, in the same duration. To emphasize the specific effect of heterojunctions, a physical mixture of WO3 and TiO2 nanosheets with the same weight ratio as the heterojunction was prepared for comparison and an inactivation rate of 68.1% demonstrated its inferior performance to the in situ synthesized WO3–TiO2 heterojunction.

(b) Photographs of bacterial colonies incubated with photocatalytically treated solutions. The solutions were treated with the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction under light irradiation for 0, 40, 80 and 100 min. SEM and TEM images of (c, d) original E. coli cells and mixture of WO3–TiO2 and bacteria under light illumination for (e, f) 1 h and (g, h) 2 h. 
To discern the bactericidal process of the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction, changes in the morphology of E. coli at different stages of inactivation were identified by both SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 6c and d, the natural E. coli cells present plump rod shape with a smooth surface and uniform membrane structure, suggesting an integrated membrane envelope. After treatment with WO3–TiO2 slurry under light irradiation for 60 min, pits and cracks appear on the bacterial surface (Fig. 6e), indicating the partial destruction of E. coli cell membrane. Meanwhile, a cavity region of low electron density could be observed in the interior part of the cell (Fig. 6f). The collapse of intracellular homeostasis and loss of cytoplasm can be ascribed to the permeability change due to cell membrane rupture. It is also noted that the WO3–TiO2 photocatalyst tends to attach on the surface of E. coli and the direct physical contact is favorable to photocatalytic inactivation.55 In 120 min, the cells are completely decomposed (Fig. 6g) and become translucent (Fig. 6h).
The photocatalytic bactericidal effect is directly related to ROS formed on the catalyst surface.56 The radicals cause oxidizing strain to the cell membrane, drive a loss of cytoplasmic contents and ultimately accelerate the death of pathogens.57 To determine the contribution of various ROS to inactivation, the disinfection experiment was carried out with individual ROS scavenger added (Fig. S22†). The trapper of H2O2, EDTA–Fe(II) significantly depresses the antibacterial performance of WO3–TiO2, which hints the dominant role of H2O2 in disinfection. The removal of ˙OH and ˙O2− by isopropanol and TEMPOL respectively weakens the inactivation efficiency moderately, suggesting that ˙OH and ˙O2− also contribute to the photocatalytic antimicrobial activity of WO3–TiO2.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have fabricated a vertical heterojunction by in situ assembling of WO3 nanosheets on TiO2 through a hydrolysis–hydrothermal method. Computational and experimental methods jointly indicate the strong electric interaction across the face-to-face interface of the WO3–TiO2 vertical heterostructure. An internal electric field formed at the interface leads to a Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism. The construction of Z-scheme charge transportation pathways is confirmed by detecting ROS, selective surface photodeposition and in situ irradiated XPS. The Z-scheme charge transfer together with structural superiority of the vertical heterojunction contribute to efficient charge transportation, spatial isolation of redox reactions and strong redox ability of photogenerated charges. As a result, the WO3–TiO2 heterojunction possesses high activity in ROS production which further promotes photocatalytic pathogen inactivation. This study will provide new insights into designing advanced heterogeneous photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and water remediation.
