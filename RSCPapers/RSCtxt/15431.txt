Their storage and bulk transportation can lead to serious hazards as a result of off-gassing (CO, CO2, CH4 combined with serious oxygen (O2) depletion). Herein, supercritical carbon dioxide extraction (scCO2) has been demonstrated as an efficient tool in significantly reducing these emissions from wood pellets. 84% of the lipids and resin acids have been removed from the sawdust prior to pelletisation. Crucially, this work reports the first off-gassing measurements associated with lipid autoxidation in wood pellets post scCO2 extraction of the sawdust. These off-gassing processes were considerably reduced for scCO2-extracted sawdust pellets, when compared to pellets prepared from virgin untreated sawdust (reference pellets). Significant reductions in the levels of CO, CO2 and CH4 (85, 85, and 94% respectively) were observed. A slight reduction in O2 concentration (20% to 19.3%) was observed for the scCO2-pellets, while an 8% decrease (reduction in O2 concentration from 20% to 12%) was observed for the reference. The results support a connection between the amount of lipids/resin acids and intermediate products of autoxidation (i.e. 71% reduction in aldehydes) and the off-gassing of CO, CO2 and CH4. Finally, there was low impact on the production, durability, calorific values and density of scCO2 pellets compared to the reference pellets. This work demonstrated that scCO2 extraction is effective as a pre-treatment technology for wood based pelletised fuels, considerably reducing the risks associated with off-gassing and oxygen depletion, while also highlighting potential chemicals and biofuels which could be generated from extracts.
Introduction
Several countries are basing their future energy source plans on the use of bioenergy-derived sources, with the goal of decreasing fossil CO2 emissions. Denmark, for example, has a challenging plan for 2050 where they plan to rely solely on renewable energy from biomass and combinations of wind, wave, and solar power.1 Biomass is one of the most important alternative energy options available to meet increasingly strict emissions targets. Both solid and liquid biofuels are forms of biomass that have become widely used in Europe and other parts of the world. Normally, such energy products (biomass pellets) are generated by compressing residual sawdust from the wood production industry at high temperature and pressure. The annual production and consumption of wood pellets in Europe in 2013 was about 12 and 18 million tonnes, respectively.2
Spontaneous emissions of CO, CO2 and CH4 during storage are known as “off-gassing”.3,4 The safety hazard of wood pellets during storage and transportation is well known.5,6 Several accidents have occurred in Europe because of this phenomenon combined with poor ventilation procedures causing irreversible harm or even death in both industrial and household settings.4,7,8 Off-gassing has also been associated with self-heating and fire incidents in the pellet industry.9,10
It has been suggested that autoxidation of fatty acids play a key role in the emissions of VOC (such as aldehydes and ketones).9 The removal of such compounds from the sawdust prior to pelletising will provide a potential method for decreasing or stopping the off-gassing while providing a valuable feedstock for the chemical and energy industry as part of a biorefinery.11–13 Previous studies have shown that the extractives may act as lubricants and result in decreasing energy consumption during pellets production; however, they also have a negative impact on pellets strength (durability).14–16 Lipids and other extractive content in the sawdust may also influence other important pellet properties such as density and gross heat. It is important that mechanical wear during handling of wood pellets is kept to a minimum in order to preserve their integrity and avoid the presence of fines or dust that increases transport losses, humidity uptake and risk of dust explosions in storage and handling. Pellet density is important for combustion and transportation; the higher the density, the more efficient these processes are. However, there is an optimum density which if surpassed leads to incomplete combustion.17
Previous work has demonstrated the potential of using supercritical CO2 (scCO2) as a suitable green extraction solvent for the extraction of lipids and other extractives.10,12 Supercritical fluids have relatively low viscosities and high diffusivities making them ideal extraction solvents.18,19 Furthermore, scCO2 extraction is scalable, the CO2 is easily recycled and the extracts can be separated by a simple depressurisation process leaving no solvent residues.12,20
Herein, scCO2 extraction of the sawdust prior to pelletisation is demonstrated as an effective method in reducing the serious off-gassing problems associated with fuel pellets. Off-gassing measurements of unwanted CO, CO2, CH4 and volatile aldehydes of scCO2 pellets were compared to pellets prepared from virgin untreated sawdust (reference pellets). Furthermore, the effects of scCO2 extraction on the physical properties of the pellets according to established standards were investigated.
Materials and methods
Raw material
For the optimisation study; fresh pine sawdust (Pinus sylvestris L.) was obtained from a sawmill (SCA Timber AB in Holmsund, northeastern Sweden, latitude 64°N). For the semi-pilot study and off-gassing measurements; fresh pine sawdust (Pinus sylvestris L.) was obtained from a saw-mill (Martinsons Såg AB, Hällnäs, northern Sweden, latitude 64°N). The sawdust raw materials were dried to 7% at 30–35 °C and grinded to 1 mm at the Biofuel Technology Centre (BTC) at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) in Umeå. The material was shipped to York, UK and kept in cold storage (10 °C) until extracted.
Supercritical carbon dioxide extractions
The scCO2 extractions were conducted using a supercritical extractor (SFE-500, Thar technologies, USA). Supercritical fluid grade carbon dioxide (99.99%, dip-tube liquefied CO2 cylinder obtained from BOC) was used in the extractions. The CO2 supplied from a cylinder as a liquid was maintained in this state through a cooling unit (−2 °C) to avoid cavitation in the high pressure pump.

Optimisation experiment extractions. 
100 g of sawdust was placed into the 500 mL extraction vessel. The reaction vessel was heated to the required temperature and 5 minutes were allowed for it to equilibrate. An internal pump was used in order to obtain the required pressure (see Table 1). The system was run in dynamic mode, in which the carbon dioxide which contained the extractives was allowed to flow into the collection vessel. A flow rate of 40 g min−1 of liquid CO2 was applied and the extraction was carried out for 4 hours. On completion the system was depressurised over a period of 60 minutes. The extractives were collected by rinsing the collection vessel twice with approximately 100 ml of dichloromethane. The solvent was removed in vacuo. The crude extract was weighed and the % yield was calculated. Eight extractions were carried out at various pressures (150, 250 and 350 bar) and temperatures (35, 45 and 55 °C).

Semi-pilot scale extractions. 
These were conducted using a supercritical extractor (SFE 2 × 5L extractor system, Thar technologies, USA). Supercritical fluid grade carbon dioxide (99.99%, dip-tube liquefied CO2 cylinder obtained from BOC) was used in the extractions. The CO2 supplied from a cylinder as a liquid was maintained in this state through a cooling unit (−2 °C) to avoid cavitation in the high pressure pump. 1.8 kg of sawdust was loaded into a 5 L extraction vessel and connected to the extraction system. The required temperature and pressure were applied. The reaction vessel was heated to 55 °C and 5 minutes were allowed for it to equilibrate. Two internal pumps were used in order to obtain the required pressure (350 bar). The system was run in dynamic mode, in which the CO2 containing the lipids was allowed to flow into three collectors. A flow rate of 300 g min−1 of liquid CO2 was applied and the extraction was carried out for 6 hours. The extractives were collected as for the optimisation experiments. A total of 11 kg of sawdust was extracted.

Experimental design and statistical analysis
ScCO2 extractions of the sawdust were optimised using a two-level factorial design (Table 1). Evaluation was made by determination of the weight of the extracts (% yield) in the different experiments and GCMS analysis of the remaining FRAs in the extracted sawdust using multiple linear regression (MLR).21
Pilot scale pellet production
Reference (non-extracted) sawdust (25 kg) and scCO2-extracted sawdust (11 kg) was shipped to Leipzig and pelletised at the Deutsches Biomasseforschungszentrum (DBFZ). After conditioning of the raw material to a water content of 12–16%, pelletising was performed in a pilot-scale pellet press (15 kW, capacity 110 kg h−1, Münch Edelstahl GmbH) using a ring die (press channel specifics: ϕ = 6 mm, L = 30 mm).
Determination of fatty acid (lipids) and resin acid content in sawdust, pellets and extractives fractions
For determination of fatty acids (lipid content) and resin acids, 3 g of each sample was extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus (Universal Extraction System B-811, Büchi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland) with a mixture (90/10% v/v) of petroleum ether (Merck, bp 40 to 60 °C) and acetone (AnalaR Normapur, VWR Chemicals, 100%) for 1 hour. Thereafter, the solvent was evaporated and 1.0 mg of heptadecanoic acid (Sigma, ≥98%) in hexane (Scharlau analytical grade, 96%, p.a.) (1.0 mg mL−1) was added as an internal standard. For saponification, 10 mL of an ethanolic (90%) 0.4 M KOH solution was added and the solution was heated to 70 °C for 4 hours. The solution, now containing the potassium salts of fatty and resin acids, was acidified with 1.5 M HCl. The saponification residues were extracted with petroleum ether (2 times, 25 mL). 1 mL of the combined extract was transferred to a 14 mL bottle and the solvent was evaporated by N2. To the dried sample, exactly 80 μl of bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoro-acetamide (BSTFA) (Fluka, ≥99%)) and 40 μl of trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (Fluka, ≥99%)) were added, and the sample, with a cap, was kept at 70 °C for 45 minutes. Excess BSTFA and TMCS were evaporated by N2 at room temperature (23 °C) and the sample was dissolved in 1 mL of dichloromethane (Sigma Aldrich, ≥99.9%). The method was based on earlier reports.21–23 Thereafter the samples were analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), using a Shimadzu GC-2010 instrument with a 30 × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film HP-5MS capillary column coated with cross-linked 5% phenyl methyl siloxane. The column was programmed as follows: Start temperature 100 °C, increase 10 °C min−1 to 220 °C, 1 °C min−1 to 235 °C and finally 10 °C min−1 to 260 °C, held for 5.5 min. Aliquots of 1 μl silylated samples were injected. The peaks were identified by comparing to reference spectra (NIST MS spectra data base 0.5). Concentrations given are expressed as equivalents of IS (i.e. setting the sensitivity in the analysis of the individual compounds to the same as for heptadecanoic acid).
Extractive fractions were analysed using the same procedure (except for the Soxhlet extraction).
Off-gassing measurements

Thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Infrared spectroscopy (TG-IR). 
Thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) was performed using a Netzsch STA 409 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, with typically 30 mg sample under flowing N2 at 100 mL min−1, coupled with a Bruker EQUINOX-55 instrument equipped with a liquid N2 cooled MCT detector.


Measuring off-gassing under laboratory conditions. 
For off-gassing measurements, two sealed plexiglass containers (H = 420 mm, ϕ = 240 mm, internal volume = 19 dm3) were used. The containers were filled with the pellet samples to 70% of their volume capacity. The experiment was done at 23 °C. Gas emissions (CO, CO2, and CH4) and oxygen levels were measured (ppmv) using a multi-instrument based on electrochemical and infrared (IR) sensors (ECOM J2KN Pro-IN gas analyser, Palgo AB, Sweden). Measurements were taken by introducing the analyser probe into the container's sampling port, which was positioned just above the upper surface of the wood pellet layer. The sampling port includes an air lock to avoid losses of gas due to the insertion of the probe. The probe was allowed to equilibrate inside the container for two minutes after being inserted before the reading was taken. After the measurement, the probe was removed from the container and a volume of fresh air equivalent to the volume of gas extracted by the analyser was admitted (according to the analyser display, an average of 1.96 L min−1). Off-gassing emissions were measured over a period of 48 hours for each sample. Off-gassing data collected on the second and subsequent sampling occasions were adjusted to reflect the quantity of gas that was removed from the container and replaced with fresh air.

Emission measurements of volatile aldehydes
A laboratory setup modified from Samuelsson et al.,24 was used for heating pellet samples and capturing expelled volatile aldehydes (and ketones). This setup (Fig. 1) has three lanes that make it possible to run three different samples in the same experiment. Three randomly taken 10 g aliquots from the 11 kg of scCO2-extracted pellets were placed in the oven at 60 °C inside 500 mL sample cells (glass washing bottles) (Fig. 1). Air was pumped through the system at 600 mL min−1 using an air sampling pump (TSI SidePak™ Model 730 Sampling Pump). The air passed through an airflow meter, water trap (that absorbs moisture from the surrounding air) and 2 m copper tubing inside the oven (in order to preheat the air to the oven temperature). Before the sample cells the flow was split into three parallel lines.
 Fig. 1  Aldehyde off gassing/sampling set-up. (1–3; sample cells). 
After passing the flow through mantled heated Teflon hoses (at 45 °C to avoid condensation), volatile aldehydes and ketones expelled from the pellets were captured in sampling cartridges (LpDNPH, Sigma-Aldrich, MO USA) being converted into their hydrazone derivatives when reacting with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in the cartridges. After the cartridges, the airflow (controlled to 200 mL min−1 for each sampling line by air flow regulators) was passed through water traps with magnesium perchlorate (LECO, Sweden) in order to protect the sampling pump. Emissions were monitored during 48 hours and samples collected during the time periods 0–1, 1–2, 2–3, 3–5, 5–8, 8–12, 12–24 and 24–48 hours respectively in order to follow the emissions over time and not overload the samplers.
Analysis of aldehydes
The sampling cartridges were eluted with 5 mL acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich Chromasolv gradient grade for HPLC, ≥99.9%, p.a.) and analysed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (Shimadzu HPLC Prominence LC-20AD, Kyoto, Japan), using a reverse phase column (RESTEK Ultra C18 150 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm particle size, Restek Corp. PA USA) thermostated at 30 °C. Solvents with a total flow rate of 1 mL min−1 were A (water) and B (acetonitrile) using a gradient: 35% B from 0 to 25 min, linear increase to 70% at 70 min, immediate increase to 100% and kept until 75 min. Ten μl of each sample were injected HPLC using the autoinjector. The ultraviolet detector recorded signals at 360 nm. A reference standard mixture (Restek Aldehyde-Ketone DNPH TO-11A 31808; formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, acetone, propionaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, butyraldehyde, benzaldehyde, iso-valeraldehyde, valeraldehyde, o-, m-, p-tolualdehyde, hexanal and 2,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde, (SUPELCO, 99.5–99.9% purity) was used to build the calibration curves for relevant aldehydes at five levels. The standard deviation of the mean (RSD%mean) for the sum of aldehydes is below 4% (n = 3). For individual aldehydes (having low emission levels, <3 μg g−1) the RSD%mean is below 20% and at higher emission levels below 3%. Identity of the sample components were verified by HPLC-MS using a Micromass Quattro micro LC (Waters, MA USA) with an Agilent 1200 system (Agilent Technologies, CA USA). Operating conditions: Neg. APCI, scan 125–600 m/z with a scan duration of 0.5 s and inter scan delay 0.1 s. Voltages: Corona 6.0 μA, Cone 13 V, Extractor 3 V, RF lens 1.7 V. Temperatures: source temperature 130 °C, APCI probe temperature 550 °C.
Physical quality parameters
In recent reviews relevant standards are discussed.25,26

Energy content. 
For determination of the gross calorific value (MJ per kg DM) of the pilot test pellets and the reference (three replicates each), an oxygen bomb calorimeter was used (1271Calorimeter, Parr Instrument Company, IL USA).27


Density. 
Density of the pellets (scCO2-extracted sample and reference (three replicates each) was determined by dividing the mass of individual pellets by their measured volume (n = 20, RSD < 10%), bulk density was determined according to the standard.28


Durability. 
Durability tests on the pellets from the pilot plant experiment were run (single experiments) according to the standard.29

Results and discussion
Supercritical extractions

Optimisation of scCO2 extraction conditions. 
In the previous work carried out by Arshadi et al.10 optimisation of supercritical extraction of sawdust was carried out, however a limited pressure range was investigated (80–250 bar). Therefore, a lab-scale optimisation study was carried out, whereby the pressure limit was increased to 350 bar.
The factorial experimental design used is a 22 (runs 1–4) with three centre points and run 4 replicated (Table 1). The response for FRAs in Table 1 showed some extreme values and therefore logarithmic transformation was used. This gave an R2 of 0.94. The extraction was found to be pressure dependent and conditions of 55 °C and 350 bar maximised the amount of FRAs extracted. Therefore, these conditions were selected for the semi-pilot plant experiments.


Semi-pilot scCO2 extractions. 
The total amount of extractives in the semi-pilot scale experiment gave a 2.6% recovery of the raw material weight. However, on an industrial scale, it is important to further optimise the conditions in order to gain maximum value from the extraction pre-treatment, especially when taking into consideration expected variation in raw material properties as well as extractive levels and composition. As pointed out in previous studies, adding a co-solvent like ethanol can add to the extraction efficiency.10

Extractives in semi-pilot plant experiment
The sawdust used was analysed for residual fatty acids (lipids) and resin acids using GC-MS as described in the Experimental section. Table 2 highlights the analysis results of the reference and extracted sawdust. The total proportion of lipids and resin extracted by scCO2 extraction was high (84%), with the efficiency for resin acids being 93% and for lipids 58%. However, for industrial applications, additional target and raw material focused optimisations are expected to improve that further, giving higher yields especially for the unsaturated lipids, e.g. by increasing the polarity of the extraction media.10 The lipids and resin acids accounted for 46% of the total extract weight. In Table 3 the fatty and resin acid composition of the extract are shown. The extract also contains a range of other compounds including sterols and the presence of these other components is reflected in the difference between total extractives weight and the GC-MS analysis.

Off-gassing from wood pellets
The pellets samples before and after scCO2 extraction were subjected to TG-IR as a simple and effective method to determine the major gases given off during oxidation such as methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Results indicated that methane was completely oxidised and was not present in the products of oxidation for both samples. Importantly, scCO2 extraction had a significant reduction in the level of CO formed as there was a much higher amount of CO in the reference pellet sample when compared to the scCO2-extracted pellet as shown in Fig. 2. This phenomenon was observed at low temperature from 220 °C up to 380 °C. The TG-IR data provided sufficient evidence to warrant a more detailed and large-scale investigation to be carried out on the off-gassing products of the two samples (reference pellets vs. scCO2-extracted pellets).
 Fig. 2  TG-IR analysis of oxidation of (a) scCO2-extracted pellets (b) reference pellets. 
A large-scale investigation was carried out whereby off-gassing measurements were carried out on 11 kg of reference and scCO2-extracted pellets during 30 days of storage. This work reports the first off-gassing data (Fig. 3) associated with lipid autoxidation in wood pellets post scCO2 extraction. Crucially, the results are in agreement with the TG-IR data which indicates that this method could be effective to estimate the suitability of biomass for storage. Fig. 3 depicts a CO release during the storage of 13 × 103 ppmv (30 days), which results in a 8% decrease in O2 concentration (from 20% to 12%) for the reference pellets prior to extraction. For the scCO2 extracted pellets however, the level of CO after storage was less than 2 × 103 ppmv, i.e. approximately 85% lower than the level detected for the reference batch. This is a significant reduction in the levels of CO generated. The lower activity in the extracted pellets reflects positively in a high O2 level, which slightly decreased from 20% to 19.3% as compared to the O2 level recorded using the reference made from the same original fresh pine sawdust. The emissions of CO2 and CH4 show the same trend, with reductions of 85% and 94% respectively. These off-gassing results are extremely encouraging and highlight the significant potential of scCO2 extraction.

Dotted line: - - - ▲ - - - scCO2 extracted pellets. Solid line: —— ■ —— reference pellets.  = O2,  = CO2,  = CO,  = CH4. 
Aldehydes emissions from wood pellets
There are considerably lower emissions of aldehydes and ketones from the pellets made from scCO2-extracted sawdust, with total aldehydes/ketones 51 μg g−1 (n = 6) as compared to the reference pellets that emit 174 μg g−1 (n = 3) in total over the 48 hours sampling period (after 48 hours the emissions were complete). This is in accordance with the lower levels of lipids/resin acids remaining in the batch after supercritical fluid extraction.

Fig. 4 shows the amount of individual aldehydes and ketones emitted from both the scCO2-extracted and the reference (non-extracted) pellets. Emissions of the individual aldehydes from the scCO2-extracted pellets are much lower (26–87%) as compared to the reference pellets, with exception of the low level emissions of but-2-enal that were unaffected. This reduction in emissions of aldehydes strongly supports the role of fatty acid autoxidation as a source of off-gassing.30

The data from the large-scale investigation is consistent with the results obtained by TG-IR data. As such, this demonstrates that TG-IR could be a quick, simple and effective method for screening off-gassing of CO from pellets.
Physical quality of the pellets for energy applications
Pellets produced from the scCO2 extracted sawdust have a similar gross heat value as compared to those produced with untreated raw material. The density and bulk density of scCO2-extracted pellets were somewhat higher (around 10%) as compared to the reference pellets and it is expected that this would have a positive effect on the transport costs of this energy feedstock. The increased density of the scCO2 pellets is a result of a decreased lubricating effect typically generated by extractives in the dye of the pellet press. Also, the reduction of extractives was reported to reduce the hydrogen bonding in the remaining material and thus the pellet strength is slightly reduced.15
The durability of the pellets shows a slight decrease as compared to the reference. However, the amount of material available (11 kg) did not allow for any optimisation of the pelletising process, which should have a potential to increase the durability. The slightly lower gross heat value for extracted material is caused by the removal of the extractives (2.6%) with a high gross heat value. The results are listed in Table 4 and crucially highlight that scCO2 extraction has no appreciable effect on pellet quality.

Economic assessment, green metrics and use of extractives as primary feedstock in biorefinery
An economic assessment was conducted to assess the viability of the process (see ESI†). The assessment conducted was based on a model by Turton et al., which looks into estimating the cost of manufacture (COM) of chemicals (see ESI†).31 This methodology has been used extensively in literature and has been proven to be adequate for estimating the costs associated with supercritical extraction of essential oils, waxes and other components from biomass.32–36 The COM was calculated in terms of five main costs; fixed capital investment (FCI), cost of operational labour (COL), cost of raw materials (CRM), cost of utilities (CUT) and cost of waste treatment (CWT) using the following equation:COM = 0.280FCI + 2.73COL + 1.23(CRM + CWT + CUT)
The COM is based on a small commercial supercritical extraction facility (used for the extraction of natural pigments, spices, nutraceuticals, essential oils etc.) with an annual capacity of around 2000 t per year. A full detailed breakdown of the costs and calculations may be viewed in the ESI.† The COM for the supercritical extraction process was estimated to be around €642 per tonne of sawdust. It was observed that the density of the biomass has a great effect on the COM. If extractions were carried out on pelletised sawdust, the COM (based on the density of the pellets in this study) would reduce significantly to €382 per tonne. Furthermore, a one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis was conducted (see ESI†) in order to determine which cost parameter (out of the five mentioned) had the greatest effect on the COM. It was found that the fixed capital investment (i.e. the initial cost of the supercritical extraction unit) followed closely by the utility costs (i.e. the electrical power required for the CO2 pumps and refrigeration) have the greatest effect on the COM while the cost of raw materials (CRM) had the smallest effect. It is estimated that the selling price of sawdust pellets is: (a) Sold as a bulk it is in the region of €225 per tonne of 8 mm pellets while it is €235 per tonne of 6 mm pellets, (b) Sold as small bags (15 kg) it is €282 per tonne of pellets. The calculated COM for the supercritical extraction is therefore higher. However, a number of assumptions have been carried out in this study. First of all, the costs assume no value for the extracts that have been obtained. In reality this will be a valuable waste stream that will be sold to generate revenue. Secondly, as stated previously, the study only takes into account a small pilot scale supercritical extraction facility (around 2000 t per year) due to the limited data available regarding the costs of supercritical extraction units. Studies have shown that though the initial FCI would be higher, scaling up to a 10000 t per year plant or higher could significantly reduce the COM by over half that stated here (due to a much larger throughput coupled with an automated handling of material which would lead to reduction in labour costs).37 Furthermore, other factors can be taken into consideration such as building the supercritical facility at the milling site so as to avoid costs associated with the transport of the sawdust.
Some green metrics were calculated based on the semi-pilot supercritical extraction carried out in this study. It should be pointed out that the extract (FRAs) obtained from the extraction process was considered to be a waste when in reality it is an added-value product (and not a waste). Therefore, the E-factor will be lower than that shown in Table 5. The same applies to the extraction mass efficiency and process mass intensity. The majority of the waste generated is the CO2 utilised in the extraction process which is relatively non-toxic. The space time yield improves significantly on moving from a lab-scale semi-pilot system to a 2000 t per year pilot plant due to a reduction in the extraction time.

As stated previously, the extract obtained from the supercritical extraction of sawdust is not a waste. Therefore, in addition to the significant reduction in off-gassing products, scCO2 extraction of pellets leads to the generation of considerable amounts of added-value products which when thinking holistically could be integrated into a wood-pellet green biorefinery. ScCO2 extraction has already been shown to be a cost effective technique in a maize stover biorefinery.12,36 Considering that 12 million tonnes of pellets were produced in 2013 in Europe using the conditions found in the present study, a potential of approximately 312000 tonnes of extract could be available per year to produce valuable chemicals or liquid fuels.
Chemicals such as the long-chain fatty acids (e.g. C18 saturated and unsaturated fatty acids) can be utilised as primary feedstocks for lubricant production and polymer applications.38 Other applications include use in soaps, detergents, polishes and cleaning compounds.39 Polyunsaturated fatty acids are well-known nutraceuticals, lowering serum cholesterol in humans.40
There is great potential to use the large abundance of resin acids in the extractives as bioactive compounds in pharmacological and phyto-epidemiological applications. These are known to have antimicrobial activity. Dehydroabietic acid and isopimaric acid have antibacterial and antifungal properties.41–43 Abietic acid has been shown to display anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic activities.44 The use of abietic acid derivatives in drug-delivery applications has also been investigated.45 Furthermore, rosin, which is primarily composed of abietic acid and pimaric acid, is used in a wide variety of applications including printing inks, varnishes, paints, chewing gum and cosmetics.46
Finally, there is potential to utilise the extractives as a feedstock for biodiesel production. Tall oil, which is high in fatty acid and resin acid content and very similar in composition to the extractives obtained in this study, has found to be an ideal feedstock for the production of bio-diesel.47,48 In Sweden 2% (100000 cubic meters tall oil diesel per year) of the total diesel consumption is covered by domestic production using tall oil from the pulp and paper and conversion applying a hydration process.49 However, biodiesel applications do not utilise the full potential of these resources to produce speciality chemicals and other higher value-added products.
Therefore, scCO2 extraction of wood pellets prior to storage and bulk transport provides an efficient and effective method to significantly reduce the harmful off-gassing products associated with pellets as well as provide a feedstock of platform molecules for biorefinery applications.
Conclusions
In this study it has been demonstrated that supercritical CO2 extraction of sawdust intended for the production of wood fuel pellets is a feasible and very promising method for improving the pellet quality in terms of storage stability by minimising the off-gassing phenomena associated with incidents of carbon monoxide poisoning and self-heating/fire.
Optimised extraction conditions based on the amount of fatty acids and resin acids remaining in the sawdust following supercritical extraction was 350 bar and 55 °C and thus extract the greatest proportions of these compounds. These conditions were therefore selected and applied in the semi-pilot scale experiment, for which total yield of extractives of 2.6% of the total raw material weight was observed.
Pellets produced from the scCO2-extracted sawdust in pilot scale were demonstrated to have comparable calorific value and density as compared to pellets produced from the reference sawdust. Durability, being production parameter dependent, was found to be a bit low but optimisation/adjustment of the pelletising process has a potential to improve the durability.
It was also demonstrated that fatty acids (lipids) and resin acids play a central role in the off-gassing and oxygen depletion process. Emissions of their autoxidation products, aldehydes, are reduced considerably in the pellets made of extracted material.
Consequently, the expected increase in the use of bioenergy will benefit from implementing this scCO2 extraction approach, thereby reducing the serious risks associated with off-gassing (especially CO and CH4) and oxygen depletion associated with the storage and transport of fuel pellets will also be minimised.
Furthermore, scCO2 extraction of the sawdust has the potential to produce an added-value feedstock for the green chemical and energy industry.
