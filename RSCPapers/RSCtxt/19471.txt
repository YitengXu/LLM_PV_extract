    , Accepted 5th October 2017First published on 5th October 2017AbstractIn this paper, six symmetrical compounds with a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) structure based on triphenylamine as a core and bridged with various spacer fragments with electron-acceptor character, such as quinoxaline, phenazine, benzo[g]quinoxaline, benzo[b]phenazine, thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine and thieno[3,4-b]quinoxaline, have been studied theoretically using two quantum methods, DFT and TD-DFT, together by considering their use in organic BHJ solar cells as potential donors of electron. Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions have been found for all of the compounds due to the electron withdrawing properties caused by the two imine nitrogen atoms in the pyrazine and the electron-donating properties of the other two amine nitrogen atoms in the two triphenylamines that compose the bridge. The ICT interactions are strengthened when the benzene or thiophene ring are fused on the pyrazine acceptor unit, which leads to a bathochromic shift of the ICT band. Moreover, our quantum calculations show that thiophene is a more appropriate ring than the benzene ring for enlarging the ICT interactions and expanding the absorption spectrum. We remark also that when a thiophene ring is fused on the quinoxaline unit in the D6 compound, a significant shift towards the near-infrared is realized, and it exhibits a maximum absorption wavelength at 690 nm compared to the other studied compounds with a threshold that is over 800 nm. This is attributed to the enhanced charge density on the acceptor spacer and narrow band gap of this compound, as revealed by our theoretical calculations. Finally, these results show that extending the conjugation of a compound based on pyrazine as an acceptor in a D–A–D structured compound can be realized by incorporating the thiophene unit in the bridge and then strengthening the ICT interactions.
1. Introduction
Photovoltaic solar cells are essentially composed of semiconductor inorganic materials such as crystalline silicon or gallium arsenide.1,2 The best conversion efficiencies of commercial inorganic photovoltaic solar cells are typically in the range 12 to 16%.3,4 Although the maximum theoretical yield of a silicon homojunction cell is close to 30%, the high cost associated with the manufacture of this type of cell restricts its wide distribution in the market.5,6 As such, organic molecules and semiconductor polymers offer an interesting alternative to the kinds of material used in photovoltaic solar cells; this is attributed to their low production costs, and their flexibility manipulates the engineering of new technologies, such as LEDs, transistors and so on.7–11 On the other hand, the degradable characteristics of the polymers guarantee clean technologies in the context of sustainable development. The photovoltaic effect has been observed in organic materials for more than 30 years, and the first organic solar cells had conversion efficiencies in the order of 5–10%.12–14
Currently, the most promising organic photovoltaic cells are designed using the association of fullerenes and an electron donor (a compound that is π-conjugated) in interpenetrating networks.15–17 In these interpenetrated network structures, the interface between the p-type semiconductor and the n-type semiconductor is distributed throughout the volume of the active layer, which makes it possible to obtain a good efficiency for the separation of the charges from photo-generated excitons, which have a very low mobility in organic materials.18,19 Conversion efficiencies of 5% for these interpenetrated network structures have been obtained using a combination of a soluble electron-donor, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), which has a conjugated polymer, and a soluble electron-acceptor, buckminsterfullerene (PCBM).20,21 Materials based on carbon (such as polymers or fullerenes) are becoming more and more frequently used in many technological applications, especially in electronics (such as field effect transistors) and optoelectronics (such as electroluminescent diodes and photovoltaic cells).22–26 On the other hand, the low band gap of conjugated organic molecules is important for facilitating the promotion of electrons to form excitons upon photoirradiation, which are able to generate free charges via electron transfer to PCBM.27–29 Some conjugated materials with low band gaps have a donor–acceptor (D–A) structure, in which their electronic properties that are related to the band gap levels can be readily tuned through a donor and acceptor unit. Compared to the conjugated D–A structure, another type of chromophore consisting of two donor moieties bridged with an acceptor unit has be shown to have stronger ICT interactions and therefore a lower band gap energy, and these kinds of structures have been reported in several papers.30,31 Recently, several reports32–38 have shown that pyrazine and thiophene rings and their derivatives provide efficiencies that can extend the conjugation of any studied compound and enhance their intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions, making them preferred materials for organic electronic applications.
Quinoxaline, phenazine, thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine and their derivatives have been widely used as acceptors in π-conjugated organic materials and have been used in the building of low band gap organic semiconductors that have exhibited promising performances in optoelectronic applications for OPVs.39–46 Thanks to their HOMO and LUMO energy levels and their low band gaps (<3 eV), conjugated organic molecules possess optical and electronic properties that make them very attractive for applications in photovoltaic devices. By modulating the electronic properties of the conjugated organic molecules, it is possible to optimize the absorption of light and thus greatly improve the energy conversion efficiency obtained in photovoltaic devices.
The amount of light absorbed by the OPV device largely depends on the fundamental energy gap (Egap) and the optical energy gap (Eopt) of the donor material. Another important property is the difference between the LUMO energy of the acceptor material and the HOMO energy of the donor material (ELH). ELH is related to the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the OPV device. One main advantage of organic semiconductor materials over inorganic materials is that the physical properties of organic materials can be easily adjusted by attaching different substituents and their electronic energy levels can be adjusted by attaching electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents.
On the other hand, density functional theory (DFT) based calculations have been significant in understanding and determining the electronic properties of different π-conjugated organic systems that are used in solar cells.47–50 Moreover, changes in the electronic and geometric properties of modified systems are conveniently addressed using this method. Performing studies using DFT will help experimentalists to design and predict more materials with the specific properties necessary for specific applications.
In this work, a series of symmetrical D–A–D compounds of π-conjugated51 type with pyrazine derivatives as electron acceptors have been studied theoretically using DFT and TD-DFT quantum methods, in order to investigate their optoelectronic properties and exploit the obtained results to design more photovoltaic materials to be used as electron donors in organic BHJ solar cells and PCBM as an electron acceptor. It is worth noting that the triphenylamine group has been used as an electron donor to construct the D–A–D chromophores, and only one pyrazine group is used in the central acceptor fragment. More specifically, we have discussed the effect of the incorporation of various bridges on the optoelectronic properties of the studied compounds listed in Fig. 1 and also on organic BHJ solar cells.

2. Computational details
In this work, the geometrical and electronic properties of all of the systems in their ground states were studied using density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional combined with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set for all of the atoms52–59 and 6-31G+(d,p) was used as the basis set for the cationic and anionic states to estimate the total reorganization energies (λtotal) and also to predict the optical properties of all of the studied compounds. None of the frequency calculations generated imaginary frequencies, indicating that the optimized geometries are minima on the potential energy surface. The localization of the electron populations was obtained through the calculated electronic populations of the HOMO and LUMO with their energies. The natural bond orbital (NBO)60 analysis was predicted through the calculated orbital populations using the NBO 6.0 program integrated into the Gaussian 09 package program. The absorption spectra, the oscillator strengths and the excitation energies of the studied compounds were calculated using the TD-CAM-B3LYP method. In this study, the integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM)61,62 has been used to account for the solvent effect on the theoretical excitation energy in order to predict the experimental spectra with reasonable accuracy. All of the calculations have been performed using the Gaussian 09 package.63
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometrical structures of the studied compounds
The obtained optimized geometries for all of the studied molecules (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, and D6) were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) levels. As shown in Fig. 2, triphenylamine groups are used as electron donors (A) for all of the compounds, while quinoxaline, phenazine, benzo[g]quinoxaline, benzo[b]phenazine, thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine and thieno[3,4-b]quinoxaline have been used as π-conjugated acceptors in the D–A–D structure for the studied compounds. The calculated bond lengths (Å) and dihedral angles (°) between the diphenylamine group and the phenyl and between the phenyl and the π-conjugated bridge for the studied compounds are listed in Table 1. The bond lengths of the studied compounds are labeled on the molecular structures, as depicted in Fig. 2. The calculated bond lengths between the diphenylamine ring and the phenyl and between the phenyl and the π-bridge of all of compounds (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, and D6) are similar to those obtained experimentally using X-ray diffraction, which means that the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level is appropriate for modelling the geometry of our compounds.

According to Roncalli's work,64,65 the obtained inter-distances between the diphenylamine group and the phenyl (R(N1–C5)) and between the phenyl and the π-bridge (R(C2–C3)) are 1.44 Å and 1.43 Å, respectively, for all of the compounds, which shows that these bond lengths have CC and NC double bond character, which facilitates the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and so the band gap remains very small for the studied compounds. Therefore, ICT is promoted and the conversion efficiency of the studied compounds is elevated.
On the other hand, we remark that the dihedral angles between triphenylamine and the π-bridge (θ(C1–C2–C3–C4) for D1, D2, D3 and D4, and θ(S–C1–C2–C3) for D5 and D6) are 40.21, 61.60, 40.27, 60.09, 16.62 and 16.40°, respectively, which can be ascribed to the steric repulsion between the hydrogen atoms and the congestion effect caused by the triphenylamine on the bridge. For D5 and D6, the dihedral angle between the diphenylamine and thienopyrazine is around 16–17°. This is attributed to the fact that more planar conformations arise from the lower steric repulsion caused by thiophene. Clearly, the replacement of the quinoxaline bridge by thienopyrazine effectively enhances the π-conjugated ability, which benefits the ICT in the D–A–D structure and causes the absorption spectra to red shift. It is worth noting that the difference between the experimental and theoretical bond angles is within 0.9–1.3°, which confirms the quality of the quantum method chosen for our calculations.
3.2. Frontier molecular orbitals of organic compounds and intramolecular electron transfer
In this work, the optoelectronic properties have been clarified by calculating the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the studied compounds using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method (Fig. 3). The electron densities of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals and details of the orbital energies of these studied compounds are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2, respectively. The B3LYP (Becke three-term functional) was chosen for our calculations of the ground state for its performance in describing the optoelectronics properties for organic materials, especially those containing N, C, H and S atoms, and this is attributed to its low percentage of the exchange Hartree–Fock effect proposed by Becke (20%)54 compared to other functionals such as PBEPBE,66 B3PW9157 and so on. We have shown this in our previous work by comparing the experimental results with those obtained theoretically.47

On the other hand, an efficient compound used in BHJ solar cells should have a non-degradable structure, fast electron injection, and a narrow band gap. Thus, the energy level of the HOMO will have to respect the air oxidation threshold (−5.2 eV),67 in the order to ensure the stability of the studied compound and also to avoid fast degradation, and the energy level of LUMO must be higher than that of PCBM (−3.75 eV)68 for the efficient injection of excited electrons.
The HOMO energies of D1 (−4.81 eV), D2 (−4.84 eV), D3 (−4.78 eV), D4 (−4.79 eV), D5 (−4.57 eV) and D6 (−4.46 eV) are close to the air oxidation potential (−5.2 eV), which means that all of the studied compounds are air-stable. Moreover, the HOMO energy level for D5 and D6 are slightly higher compared to that of the other compounds, which indicates that their HOMO level has been destabilized by introducing thiophene substitution. Compared to the LUMO of PCBM (−3.7 eV), the LUMO energy level of the studied compounds is above to that of PCBM. This means that the excited electrons of the studied compounds are efficiently injected into the LUMO of PCBM. Moreover, as shown in Table 2, the obtained values at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level for the HOMO, LUMO and gap energy are close to those obtained experimentally, and this is attributed to the appropriate functional that was used (B3LYP) and also to the extended basis set (dual polarization), in which the d orbital is reserved to the heavy atoms, such as carbon, nitrogen and sulfur, and the p orbital is reserved to the hydrogen atom.
On the other hand, we remark that the ΔEH–L of D1 (2.87 eV) has been affected by the introduction of the phenyl ring on the pyrazine group into the bridge for D2, as ΔEH−L decreases by 0.25 eV, and for D3, ΔEH–L decreases by 0.49 eV compared to that of D1 due to a significantly decreased LUMO, and this can be influenced by tuning the position of the phenyl compared to D2. Moreover, the ΔEH–L values of D4 and D5 are 2.14 and 2.25 eV, respectively, which are slightly smaller than those of D1, D2, and D3, and this is attributed to the additive phenyl fused on the phenazine ring, which strengthens the π-conjugated character for D4, and for D5, this gap is attributed to the incorporation of the thiophene ring containing a heteroatom that is electron rich into the bridge. Finally, we remark that the compound D6 has been strongly influenced by introducing the phenyl ring on the thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine and presents a smaller ΔEH–L compared to D5. This indicates that this compound has a high conversion efficiency and absorbs more photons in the longer wavelength range, in the case where it is used as an electron donor in organic BHJ solar cells. As a remark, all of the substituting rings introduced on the bridge decrease the LUMO level value compared to D1, implying the different electron-withdrawing effects, which stabilize the LUMO level of the studied compounds.
As shown in Fig. 3, the HOMOs of the studied compounds are delocalized on the whole molecule; these are mainly contributed to by the donor (D), whereas the LUMOs are delocalized over the acceptor (A) (the π-conjugated bridge). We remark also that the studied compounds demonstrate a strong overlap between the HOMO and LUMO on the bridge (acceptor unit), which enhances the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) for these compounds by facilitating the charge transfer from the electron donating triphenylamine unit to the electron-withdrawing pyrazine unit. Moreover, with the fusion of the benzene or thiophene on the central pyrazine unit, especially for D4, D5, and D6, the delocalization of the HOMOs clearly extends to the fused benzene or thiophene ring in the acceptors. Therefore, a better overlap between the HOMO and the LUMO provides facile charge transfer from the electron donor to the acceptor.

Table 3 indicates that the HOMOs of D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, and D6 have 9%, 13%, 12%, 24%, 26% and 34% acceptor skeleton components, respectively, and this indicates that the fused thiophene rings on the pyrazine disperse the electron density and make the electrons more delocalized in the acceptor system, especially for D5, and D6, and consequently decrease the energy levels of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). On the other hand, the LUMOs of these compounds have 90%, 96%, 94%, 96%, 80% and 86% acceptor (A) components, respectively, and have 5%, 2%, 3%, 2%, 10% and 7% donor (D) components, respectively. This means that the fused thiophene on the pyrazine in compounds D5 and D6 pushes the electrons towards the donor part and enhances the charge transfer, and this is attributed to the sulfur atom which is rich in electrons. Therefore, we may anticipate that the proposed bridge of all of the compounds is more electron-withdrawing, which makes them more likely to couple with the PCBM surface and then more favorable for electron injection into the LUMO of PCBM.

Moreover, we remark through Fig. 3 that the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of the six compounds are well-overlapped, and the strong overlap between the two HOMO and LUMO orbitals facilitates intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), especially when there are electron transitions in these orbitals. To confirm this finding, electron density variations (Δρ) have been calculated between the excited state and ground state of the studied compounds (Fig. 4), with blue and purple color representing the regions where the electrons are coming from and where the electrons are going to upon successful excitation. As depicted in Fig. 4, the density depletion zones (blue) are mostly located on the donor unit, while the regions of density enhancement (purple) are mainly localized on the acceptor unit (the bridge) which indicates that there has been intramolecular charge transfer upon the transition from the donor to acceptor (HOMO to LUMO) for all of the compounds except for D2, which may support other preferable transitions from the HOMO to LUMO, such as HOMO−1 to LUMO. Therefore, we conclude that the electronic transition, especially from the HOMO level to LUMO level, may be involved in ICT for these compounds, which allows for rapid interfacial electron injection from these compounds to the LUMO of PCBM.

The contour thresholds for the molecular orbitals and density differences are 0.01 and 0.0004 a.u., respectively. The blue and purple color represents the regions where the electrons are coming from and where the electrons are going to, respectively. 
3.3. NBO analysis
To understand the origins of the electron transfer mechanism, natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis has been carried out based on the optimized geometries of the ground state for each compound (see Table 3) in order to compare the partial charges on the donor moiety (triphenylamine) and the acceptor moiety (the bridge). The positive charges of the triphenylamine groups of all of the studied compounds demonstrated that there were effective electron-pushing units (electron-donating). On the other hand, the negative charges in the bridge (quinoxaline, phenazine, benzo[g]quinoxaline, benzo[b]phenazine, thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine and thieno[3,4-b]quinoxaline) demonstrated that this unit behaves as an acceptor and may trap the electron in the molecular backbone. Upon photo-excitation, the electrons localized on the donor group of the studied compounds are transferred to the auxiliary acceptor and then migrate to PCBM behaving as an acceptor of electrons in the organic BHJ solar cell. This is consistent with the electron-accepting behavior of the incorporated bridge. In other words, upon the physisorption on the PCBM surface, the electrons could be successively transferred from the donor group with a positive charge to the auxiliary acceptor with a negative charge, and then injected into the LUMO of the PCBM compound. As shown in Table 3, the charge differences between the donor group and acceptor group indicate that the D–A–D architecture of our studied compounds could donate more electrons to PCBM when this structure is used in organic BHJ solar cells, especially from D3, D5, and D6. This finding is confirmed by the increase of the NBO charges on the donor and acceptor moieties for these compounds and indicates that the effect of the fusion of the thiophene ring is more significant than that of the benzene ring. As a result and based on the “push–pull–push” architecture, it is clearly shown that this construction helps to enhance the intramolecular charge transfer by the delocalization of the electrons on the entire molecule and with more overlap between the donor group and the acceptor group, consequently enhancing the photo-conversion yield of these studied compounds.
3.4. Photovoltaic properties and reorganization energy
The power conversion efficiency of the solar cells is generally related to the maximum open circuit voltage (Voc) as expressed in eqn (2), in which this parameter is calculated theoretically as the energy difference between the HOMO level of donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor (PCBM):68 (1) Voc = |EDonorHOMO| − |EAcceptorLUMO| − 0.3(2)
From Table 4, the Voc ranges from 0.46 to 0.81 eV and we remark also that these values are positive for all of the studied compounds, which indicates that the transfer of electrons will be easy from the donor compound (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, and D6) to the semiconductor PCBM. Moreover, we conclude that these obtained values are sufficient to have a highly efficient electron injection into the LUMO of PCBM. Comparing the LUMO of the studied compounds and the LUMO level of semiconductor PCBM, we remark that the LUMO level of PCBM is placed below the LUMO of all of the studied compounds, which indicates that all of the compounds are likely to be injected in the excited state.

In addition, based on the Marcus electron transfer theory,69 the total reorganization energy, λt, could also affect the kinetics of electron injection, which can be approximately described as: (3)where A is a pre-factor that depends on the strength of the electronic coupling between the dye and the surface, λ is the total reorganization energy (the solvent (λs) and internal (λi) reorganization energies), kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.
Moreover, the reorganization energy is an important parameter for organic compounds in determining its carrier mobility.70 In addition, a larger carrier mobility for any organic compound corresponds to a small reorganization energy,69 in which the reorganization energy is calculated using the following formula:71 λi = [E±0 − E±±] − [E0± − E0](4)where E±0 is the energy of the cation or anion calculated with the optimized structure of the neutral molecule, E±± is the energy of the cation or anion calculated with the optimized cation or anion structure, E0± is the energy of the neutral molecule calculated at the cationic or anionic state, and the E0 is the energy of the neutral molecule at ground state.
As shown in Table 4, the obtained results at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level show that the reorganization energies are smaller and quasi-similar for all of the compounds, indicating that these compounds are typical electron transport materials and are characterized by high charge transfer rates, and that λh and λe are influenced by the insertion of different π-bridges into D1. Moreover, we remark that the differences between λh and λe from all of the compounds are close to 0, which indicates that these compounds have more balanced transport. It is worth noting that for obtaining a high photo-conversion efficiency for any organic material used in BHJ solar cell, a balance between the holes and electrons reorganization energy must be verified.72,73
3.5. Chemical reactivity indices
Based on the HOMO and LUMO levels of the studied compounds, the chemical potential (μ), chemical hardness (η), electronegativity (χ) and electrophilicity power (ω) can be calculated as follows:74μ = (EHOMO + ELUMO)/2 (chemical potential),η = (ELUMO − EHOMO)/2 (chemical hardness),χ = −(EHOMO + ELUMO)/2 (electronegativity),ω = μ2/2η (electrophilicity power)
From Table 4, we remark that the chemical potential of all of the studied compounds is higher that of PCBM (μ = −4.9), which means that the electrons escape from those compounds with a high chemical potential to PCBM with a small chemical potential, indicating that the PCBM behaves as a good acceptor of electrons and the other compounds behave as good donors of electrons in the BHJ solar cell. In addition, we remark that the electronegativity of PCBM is higher than that of other compounds, indicating that electrons are attracted from the studied compounds to PCBM in the BHJ solar cell. Moreover, PCBM possesses the biggest value of chemical hardness (η) over the other compounds, and this means that it is very easy to for electrons to transfer from these compounds to the PCBM, Finally, we remark that PCBM is more electrophilic than the other compounds with the lowest values of ω, which indicates that theses compounds are good donors of electrons in BHJ solar cells when PCBM behaves as an acceptor of electrons.
3.6. Electronic absorption spectra
The TD-DFT method has become a powerful tool for predicting the optical properties of organic materials.75,76 At same time, it is found that UV-vis spectra predicted using the CAM-B3LYP functional are in good agreement with those measured experimentally,58,77 which allows us to use it to calculate the electronic vertical transition energy, oscillator strengths (f), maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) and nature of the transitions with high confidence in this paper. The obtained results are tabulated in Table 5 and the corresponding spectrum is plotted in Fig. 5 and 6. From Table 5, we remark that the strongest absorption peaks mainly correspond to the transition from the HOMO to the LUMO (π–π*) for all of the compounds. Moreover, we remark that the maximum absorption wavelengths of compounds D2–D6 are red-shifted compared to D1 (371 nm) in the following order: D2 (415 nm) < D3 (435 nm) < D4 (520 nm) < D5 (528 nm) < D6 (690 nm).

On the other hand, and upon fusing a phenylene group on the benzene ring of quinoxaline unit, a red shift of 44 nm has been observed for D2 (415 nm), which is attributed to extended effective π-conjugation. However, when the phenylene group is fused on the pyrazine of the quinoxaline unit, a larger shift of 64 nm toward the red has been observed for D3 (435 nm). This is obviously due to the less twisted conjugation structure of D3 compared to that of D2 (Fig. 1), which results in more effective conjugation and stronger ICT interactions. Similarly, an auxiliary benzene ring fused on the phenazine unit further shifts the absorption to 520 nm for D4. These results suggest that the extension of the conjugation of the pyrazine group vertical to the direction of the D–A–D backbone has a significant effect on the ICT interactions. However, upon replacing quinoxaline with thienopyrazine, D5 exhibits the maximum absorption wavelength at 528 nm with a bathochromic shift of 157 nm in comparison to D1, which is attributed to the much stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the thienopyrazine unit compared to the quinoxaline unit, and this is explained by the difference in the electronegativity for the S atoms, leading to better electron delocalization for the sulfur atom compared to the nitrogen atom. Furthermore, we remark that upon further fusion of a benzene ring on the thienopyrazine unit, an organic near infra-red peak of D6 is realized (690 nm) and its absorption spectrum covers the whole visible region and extends to the near infra-red (NIR) region with the maximum located, indicating the strongest donor–acceptor ICT interaction in D6. As a result, the calculated spectral data confirms that the introduction of thienopyrazine as an acceptor in the D–A–D system could be favorable for long wavelength light harvesting, and beneficial to the photo-to-electric conversion efficiency of related solar cells of organic materials before and after they are adsorbed on PCBM.
4. Conclusions
In summary, based on DFT and TD-DFT approaches, we performed a comprehensive theoretical study on the electronic and optical properties of six symmetrical compounds with a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) structure based on triphenylamine bridged with various spacers with electron-acceptor character, in order to use them as donors of electrons in BHJ solar cells. Our investigations show that the fusion of thiophene on pyrazine into compounds D5 and D6 led to an improvement in the influence of the gap energy and maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) of these compounds, and also better balance transport of both holes and electrons. It can be found that the six D–A–D compounds exhibit different ICT interactions due to the various electron-withdrawing abilities of the bridge. The obtained results show that the LUMO orbitals were localized on the acceptor moiety of all of the studied compounds, which make injection into the LUMO of PCBM upon the excitation state easy. Moreover, the LUMO level of all of the studied compounds were localized on the LUMO of PCBM, which means that the electrons escape to the LUMO of PCBM. The simulated absorption spectra of the six compounds exhibited maxima attributed to the π/π* transitions in the range 371–690 nm. We have observed that the replacement of the quinoxaline unit by the thienopyrazine and thieno[3,4-b]quinoxaline unit causes a red shift for D5 and D6, respectively, compared to the other compounds. Our findings will help in understanding the structure–property relationship of organic materials based on pyrazine by considering their use as a potential donor of electrons in organic BHJ solar cells and also to control the charge transfer in pyrazine derivatives for the construction of low band gap materials. Furthermore, the D–A–D structure of the studied compounds is used to reduce the band gap of the organic materials for improving the absorption. We hope that theoretical study could provide a guiding tool for designing other organic materials based on triphenylamine with high optoelectronic properties.
