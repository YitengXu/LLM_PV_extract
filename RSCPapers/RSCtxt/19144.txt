1 Introduction
All-polymer solar cells have attracted considerable attention in recent years as an alternative to polymer/fullerene solar cells,1–5 because the polymer/polymer blends may allow for covering the complementary parts of the solar spectrum by tuning the energy levels of each component. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the all-polymer solar cells are generally lower than that of the fullerene-based organic solar cells due to the undesirable morphological characteristics of the polymer blends, such as a large phase separation,6–8 inhomogeneous internal phase composition,9–11 and poor crystallinity.12
In order to form a well-defined morphology with microphase separation, various rod–coil block copolymers have been synthesized. There are basically two approaches to synthesizing rod–coil conjugated polymers. The first one is the grafting-to method, in which an end-functional rod block is first prepared and then reacted with an end-functional non-conjugated coil block. As examples, poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-polystyrene (P3HT-b-PS),13 PS-b-P3HT-b-PS,14 and poly(4-vinyltriphenylamine) (PVTPA)-b-P3HT-b-PVTPA15 were synthesized by anionic linking reactions, while poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-b-P3HT16,17 was prepared by the cycloaddition reaction based on click chemistry. The other approach is the grafting-from method, in which an end-functional rod block is used as a macroinitiator to initiate the polymerization of the coil blocks. Typically, PS-b-P3HT-b-PS,18 P3HT-b-PS19 and P3HT-b-polyisoprene19 were synthesized via the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) and nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP), respectively. However, these block copolymers are not ideal candidates for polymer solar cells (PSCs) due to the insulating coil blocks.
Since 2005, with the discovery of the chain-growth polycondensation of the regioregular P3HT, also referred to as the quasi-living Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization, by McCullough et al.20 and Yokozawa et al.,21 independently, a variety of rod–rod block copolymers have been synthesized by the sequential monomer addition technique. For example, by adding two different thiophene derivatives in sequence, the all-conjugated rod–rod block copolymers, such as P3HT-b-poly(3-dodecylthiophene),20 P3HT-b-poly(3-(2-(2-methoxylethoxyl)ethoxy)methylthiophene),22 P3HT-b-poly(3-phenoxy methylthiophene),23 P3HT-b-poly(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene),24 P3HT-b-poly(3-(2-(2-(2-methoxylethoxyl)ethoxy)ethoxyl)methylthiophene),25 and poly(3-butylthiophene)-b-poly(3-octylthiophene),26 were prepared. In addition, all-conjugated block copolymers containing different backbones were also synthesized by the sequential polymerization process. Some examples are as follows: poly(p-phenylene)-b-P3HT,27 poly(m-phenylene)-b-P3HT,28 poly(dioctylfluorene)-b-poly(2,5-dihexyloxyphenylene),29 poly(3-hexylselenophene)-b-P3HT,30 and polyfluorene-b-poly(p-pheneylene).31 These all-conjugated rod–rod block copolymers have been used in interesting applications in PSCs with well-defined microphase separations between the heterophase segments.32 More detailed information about the synthetic aspects of the rod–coil and rod–rod copolymers, as well as the application of these block copolymers in PSCs, was well-documented in excellent review papers.33–37
In contrast, the examples of all-conjugated donor–acceptor (D–A) block copolymers, in which the electron donor blocks and the electron acceptor blocks are connected through a conjugated linkage, are still few due to the synthetic difficulties. However, academic interest in the synthetic methodology of these types of block copolymers and the potential application of these polymers in all-polymer solar cells has encouraged us to investigate this topic. In this minireview, we highlight the recently developed synthetic methods for synthesizing the all-conjugated D–A block copolymers and the application of the block copolymers to all-polymer solar cells.
2 Synthesis of all-conjugated D–A block copolymers
All-conjugated D–A block copolymers have received considerable interest because they may self-assemble into regular nanostructures due to the reduced entropy of mixing and a balance between nanoscale phase separation, chain stretching, and interfacial energies. Moreover, the combination of both donor and acceptor blocks in one chain makes it possible to fabricate high performance all-polymer solar cells using the copolymers as the single-active components or surfactants in the blends of the respective homopolymers. Two aspects are of critical importance in the design concept of all-conjugated D–A block copolymers. One is the existence of donor and acceptor units, which is a prerequisite in order to function the charge separation and transportation in PSC applications. The other is the chemical linkage between the donor and acceptor blocks for inducing microphase separation, with 10–20 nm distance, which corresponds to exciton diffusion length and further enhances the charge separation.
Though it was a big challenge to synthesize these types of copolymers a few years ago, some examples of the all-conjugated D–A block copolymers have been synthesized in the past two years. Scheme 1 summarizes the methods that have been used up to now. The methodologies can be classified into four types. Type I is a sequential monomer addition method involving the catalyst-transfer polycondensation, in which one block is polymerized and other types of monomers are then directly added to the reaction mixture to produce the other block. Type II is an end-functional polymer coupling method, also referred to as a grafting-to method, in which an end-functional p-type polymer and an end-functional n-type block are combined by coupling reactions. Type III is an end-functional polymer copolymerization method. In this process, an end-functional p-type polymer (mostly bromo-end functional P3HT, P3HT-Br) is allowed to be copolymerized with electron acceptor monomers. Type IV is a macroinitiator method, also referred to as a grafting-from method, in which an n-type polymer is synthesized with end-functional groups and a p-type monomer is then polymerized by an n-type macroinitiator. In the following sections, the methods and the types of block copolymers will be discussed in detail.

2.1 Sequential monomer addition method
The sequential monomer addition method by catalyst-transfer polycondensation should be the ideal method to synthesize the all-conjugated D–A block copolymers, because it is a one-pot process and, in addition, it is possible to synthesize well-defined conjugated polymers with controlled molecular weights and low polydispersities, as well as the molar and weight ratios of donor and acceptor blocks.34,38,39 However, even though the chain-growth polymerization of n-type conjugated polymers by catalyst-transfer polycondensation have become possible in recent times,39,40 the all-conjugated D–A block copolymers directly synthesized by this approach have never been reported. There are some examples of all-conjugated D–A block copolymers prepared by the sequential monomer addition method, however, extra steps of post-functionalization or conversion are needed.
Higashihara and co-workers41 synthesized the all-conjugated block copolythiophene, P3HT-b-poly(3-(4′-(3′′,7′′-dimethyloctyloxy)-3′-pyridinyl)thiophene) (P3PyT), by GRIM polymerization. By adding [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) into the donor–donor block copolymers, they found that a supramolecular interaction was formed between the pyridine unit of P3HT-b-P3PyT and PCBM, as illustrated in Chart 1, P1. Interestingly, the incorporation of P3HT-b-P3PyT into the conventional P3HT/PCBM blend-based photovoltaic cells as a surfactant significantly reduced the aggregation of PCBM upon extra annealing, resulting in a better thermal stability during solar cell use.
 Chart 1  Chemical structure of P1, P2, and P3. 
Chan et al.42 reported the synthesis of all-conjugated C60-containing block copolymers (P2 in Chart 1) based on the GRIM polymerization. In this study, the authors first prepared the all-conjugated block copolymers, poly(3-(6-bromohexyl)thiophene) (P3BrHT)-b-P3HT, followed by the incorporation of C60 as a substitute into the P3BrHT block by an azide functional group. It was found that P2 can induce the formation of a self-organization nanostructure of the P3HT domain. Moreover, P2 can serve as a compatibilizer to reduce the interfacial tension between the P3HT and C60, thus helping to establish a moderate phase separated morphology with the crystalline P3HT and C60 domains.
Tajima and co-workers43,44 also reported the fullerene attached all-semiconducting diblock copolymers, P3, as presented in Chart 1. The molar ratio of PCBM in the block copolymers can be tailored through the molar ratio of m to l, and the block length can be precisely controlled due to the quasi-living nature of the polymerization. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) phase images of the block copolymer film showed a clear nanopattern with a size around 20 nm. Besides, no PCBM aggregation of the diblock copolymer film was observed under optical microscopy after annealing at 130 °C for 80 h. These results suggested that the microphase-separated structure of the diblock copolymers can stabilize the film morphology and simultaneously the device performance.
A well-defined donor–acceptor diblock copolymer based on P3HT and poly(isocyanide) with perylene diimide pendant groups, P4, has recently been synthesized by the sequential monomer addition method as illustrated in Scheme 2.45 It is interesting that the mechanistically distinct polymerization of P3HT and poly(isocyanide) proceeded in a controlled fashion to give molecular weights that were proportional to the monomer-to-catalyst feed ratios. The preliminary characterizations revealed that P4 underwent microphase separation in the solid state, and photoluminescence quenching was observed in the thin films. These results indicated that P4 would be excellent candidates for PSCs applications.
 Scheme 2  Synthetic approach of P4. 
2.2 End-functional polymer coupling (grafting-to) method
The grafting-to method is an approach based on the coupling of an end-functional p-type polymer with an end-functional n-type polymer. However, the combination efficiency of two polymers by the coupling reaction is relatively low due to the low concentration of end-functional groups, especially when the two polymers have high molecular weights. Moreover, an excess amount of one of the polymers is required for increasing the coupling efficiency,46–48 which requires the tedious isolation of the polymer mixtures. In particular, in cases of high molecular weight polymers, the isolation process becomes quite difficult.
The all-conjugated D–A–D triblock copolymers, poly(3-octylthiophene)-b-poly(quinoxaline)-b-poly(3-octylthiophene) (P3OT-b-PQ-b-P3OT), P5 and P6 as shown in Scheme 3A, were synthesized in three steps by Woody et al.:46 (1) the synthesis of a well-defined monofunctional telechelic P3OT donor block that bears a single α-bromothienyl end group; (2) the synthesis of a PQ acceptor block bearing a complementary boronate ester functionality at both ends; and (3) coupling of the two polymer chains under Suzuki cross-coupling conditions. In this study, the authors used 4 equiv. of hexane-soluble Ph-P3OT-Br, and the lower molecular weight hexane-soluble fraction of the P3OT donor block was used in order to simplify the purification process after the coupling reaction. Further investigation of these block copolymers revealed an efficient fluorescence quenching of the polymers in the solid state, supporting the existence of electron transfer.
 Scheme 3  Synthetic approaches of P5–P8. 
Greenham et al.47 reported an all-conjugated D–A diblock copolymer P3HT-b-PFTBTT, P7, as shown in Scheme 3B. In their method, a well-defined P3HT with one terminal bromine functionality was first prepared by the GRIM polymerization following the McCullough procedure.20 The acceptor block, PFTBTT, was synthesized via the Stille cross-coupling procedure using the asymmetric type monomer with the α-stannyl and ω-bromo end groups. After the reaction, the P3HT-Br was added to the reaction as a macromolecular end-capper (Scheme 3B). The product synthesized by this approach, however, is a mixture of approximately 53% diblock copolymer, 42% PFTBTT homopolymer and 5% P3HT homopolymer.
Recently, Sommer et al.48 reported an all-conjugated D–A diblock copolymer P3HT-b-PF8TBT, P8, in Scheme 3C, by an approach similar to Greenham et al. As presented in Scheme 3C, PF8TBT was polymerized via the Suzuki polycondensation followed by in situ end-capping with P3HT-Br. In order to minimize the generation of the PF8TBT homopolymer, an excess of P3HT-Br was used. Afterward, the as-synthesized block copolymers were fractionated using preparative gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to remove any unreacted P3HT. Unfortunately, no microphase separation was observed for P8, and the authors tentatively ascribed it to the presence of the two side chains on the thiophene rings in PF8TBT, which enhance the miscibility of the P3HT segments in the PF8TBT domains.
2.3 End-functional polymer copolymerization method
Though the end-functional polymer copolymerization method also involves the use of an end-functional polymer, typically P3HT-Br, similar to the grafting-to method, the synthetic process is different and relatively simplistic. In this method, P3HT-Br and the acceptor monomers are added at the same time and copolymerized in a one-pot process. As illustrated in Scheme 4, the all-conjugated D–A block copolymer P3HT-b-poly(fluorene-co-benzothiadiazole), P9, was synthesized by the end-functional polymer copolymerization method,49,50 in which P3HT-Br (end-functional polymer), fluorene and benzothiadiazole (n-type monomers) were added at the same time to the reaction mixture and then the Suzuki polymerization was carried out to afford P9. In order to remove the homopolymer impurities, a combination of solvent extraction and column chromatography was performed. Extensive washing of the polymeric product with hexane in a Soxhlet apparatus was needed to remove the homopolymer contaminants without dissolving the diblocks. Silica gel column chromatography was finally performed to remove the unreacted P3HT-Br.
 Scheme 4  Synthetic approach of P9. 
The same approach has been used to synthesize P3HT-b-poly(pyridinium pheneylene) (PPymPh), P10 by Swager et al.51 As shown in Scheme 5, a precursor block copolymer, P3HT-b-PPyPh, was synthesized under the Yamamoto coupling conditions, which was subsequently subjected to intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions to produce the cyclic pyridiniums. P10 was soluble in organic solvents and displayed broad optical absorption bands over the visible spectrum. In addition, the block copolymers demonstrated nanodomains of ca. 20 nm in diameter, which matched the expected exciton diffusion lengths.
 Scheme 5  Synthetic approach of P10. 
Hawker et al.52 proposed a strategy for the synthesis of the all-conjugated D–A block copolymers in a single reaction step by employing the Stille coupling polycondensation. As presented in Scheme 6, the bromo-end functional polythiophene was allowed to be copolymerized with AA and BB monomers. By changing the types of the bromo-end functional polythiophenes or BB monomers, a variety of block copolymers was prepared by this method (see P11, P12, and P13 shown in Scheme 6). One of the advantages of this strategy is the high degree of flexibility afforded over the structure and chemical compositions of the resulting block copolymers. For example, the molecular weights and relative block lengths of the block copolymers can be tailored by varying the molecular weight and amount of the precursor P3HT toward AA + BB monomers. Interestingly, well-defined and distinct phase-separated domains were observed in the thin film made from P11 after annealing at 265 °C, which was above the melting transition for both the P3HT and DPP crystallites.
 Scheme 6  Synthetic approach of P11–P13. 
Recently, the all-conjugated D–A block copolymer, P3HT-b-poly(naphthalene bisimide)-b-P3HT, P14, was synthesized by Nakabayashi et al.53 under the Yamamoto coupling conditions in a high yield (>85%). In this study, P3HT-Br was prepared with different molecular weights, and it was then allowed to be copolymerized with the NBI-Br2 monomers (Scheme 7) to produce P14 with different P3HT segment compositions. Technically, the obtained product prepared by this method would be a mixture of triblock copolymers and byproducts, such as the coupled-P3HT and diblock copolymer P3HT-b-PNBI. However, after the Soxhlet extraction with acetone and chloroform, and finally precipitation from methanol, the product showed a sharp and unimodal peak in the GPC curve, which suggested the almost total absence of byproducts. The potential application of P14 as acceptor materials in all-polymer solar cells has been investigated and will be discussed in Section 3.
 Scheme 7  Synthetic approach of P14. 
High molecular weight all-conjugated D–A block copolymers (P15 and P16 in Chart 2) were synthesized by Verduzco et al.54,55 The synthetic strategy is similar to their previous studies,49,50 which involves a combination of the GRIM and Suzuki coupling polymerizations. P3HT-Br was first polymerized by GRIM and used as an end-functional polymer in the Suzuki polymerization with electron acceptor monomers. Three different sizes of the P3HT-Br were synthesized with a relatively low PDI and regioregularity higher than 93% in this study. Consequently, P15 and P16 with different P3HT compositions were prepared. Analysis of the block copolymers indicated that the P3HT crystallinity was reduced or completely suppressed compared to the homo P3HT. The results also suggested that the proper balance of block ratios was important for the development of the all-conjugated block copolymers for PSC applications.

2.4 Macroinitiator (grafting-from) method
The methods employing the end-functional polymer mentioned above have successfully produced several types of all-conjugated D–A block copolymers. However, the generation of homopolymer byproducts are sometimes inevitable. Besides, in order to vary the composition of the donor and acceptor blocks, P3HT-Br with different molecular weights should be individually prepared in advance. To address these issues, the macroinitiator (grafting-from) method has recently been developed to synthesize all-conjugated graft copolymers comprised of an acceptor backbone and donor graft chains by Wang and Higashihara.56 As presented in Scheme 8, a CTT unit that bears a chlorotoluene group was introduced in the backbone of the n-type polymer PNDICTT, then an externally initiated catalyst-transfer polycondensation of the thiophene monomers initiated by PNDICTT was carried out to produce a series of all-conjugated graft copolymers, P17. The number of P3HT graft chains could be predetermined in the first step of synthesizing the PNDICTT, simply by varying the feed molar ratio of the NDI to CTT monomers (x to y in Scheme 8). In addition, the molecular weight of each P3HT graft chain could be tailored in the second step by varying the feed molar ratio of the thiophene monomers to PNDICTT macroinitiators. The grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) results indicated that the P17 thin film possessed two crystalline domains of the edge-on P3HT domains and isotropically dispersed PNDICTT domains. In addition, a microphase separation between the P3HT and PNDICTT domains was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
 Scheme 8  Synthetic approach of P17. 
The grafting-from method was further used to synthesize the all-conjugated D–A–D block copolymers as shown in Scheme 9.57 Similarly, the following two step method was proposed: (1) an acceptor block, PNDITh-Br2, was synthesized via the Stille coupling polycondensation, and (2) P3HT blocks emanated from both ends of the PNDITh-Br2 via a catalyst-transfer polycondensation to produce an all-conjugated ABA-type block copolymer comprised of both donor and acceptor blocks, P18. It is worth noting that in the second step, PNDITh-Br2 was transformed into a macroinitiator with a Ni(COD) terminal, followed by an in situ ligand exchange to afford the Ni(dppp) terminal, for the polymerization of thiophene monomers in a one-pot process. Similar to P17, the chain length and composition of P3HT in P18 can also be tailored simply by varying the feed molar ratio of the thiophene monomers to PNDITh-Br2 macroinitiators. The products prepared by this method show very sharp and narrow peak in the GPC analysis, with the lowest PDI of 1.15, which was ascribed to the living nature of catalyst-transfer polycondensation and a comprehensive prevention from aggregating the PNDITh block. The TEM results indicated that a well-defined lamellar morphology was formed between the P3HT and PNDITh domains, and the morphology was stable after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 1 h.

3 Application in all-polymer solar cells
The all-conjugated D–A block copolymers are new materials as compared to the coil–coil, rod–coil, and rod–rod donor–donor block copolymers. Actually, some excellent application examples of the all-conjugated D–A block copolymer in all-polymers solar cells have been reported.47,53,55
Greenham et al.47 investigated the application of P7 as surfactants in the all-polymer solar cells. The solar cell device based on the P3HT/PFTBTT homopolymer blend showed a PCE of 1.50% after annealing at 130 °C, while the PCEs of the devices with ternary blends of P3HT/PFTBTT/P7 fabricated under the same conditions was 1.13% and 0.76% for the 17% and 40% contents of P7, respectively. However, after annealing at 200 °C for 10 min, the PCE of the device with homopolymer blends significantly decreased to 0.61%. In contrast, the PCEs of the devices based on the ternary blends all increased, 1.17% and 0.98% for the 17% and 40% blends of P7, respectively, which mostly resulted from the increase in the short circuit current and fill factor. These results demonstrated that the all-conjugated block copolymer can be used as surfactants in all-polymer solar cells as a new approach toward the control of the crystallinity and nanostructure of photovoltaic polymer blends.
In the study of Nakabayashi et al.,53 the all-conjugated block copolymer P14 was used as an acceptor material in all-polymer solar cells in which P3HT was employed as a donor material. The device architecture is as follows: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:P14(1:1 weight ratio)/Ca/Al. The as-spun device gave a low PCE of 0.5% with the Voc of 0.51 V, Jsc of 2.12 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.47. A drastic improvement in the PCE (1.2%) was achieved after annealing at 200 °C due to a significant increase in Jsc and FF. The AFM results showed that the surface of the annealed blend film was much smoother than that of the as-spun blend film.
Most recently, P16 has been used as the single-active component in the PSCs.55 The weight average molecular weight of P16 is 29 kg mol−1, and the content of P3HT is 56 wt%. As a control, solar cell devices with the P3HT/PFTBT blends as active layers were also investigated. For the devices based on P16, the average PCE of 1.5% was recorded after annealing at 100 °C for 20 min, and the PCE of 1.7% was obtained with the extended annealing time of 90 min at 100 °C. An optimal performance was achieved by annealing at 165 °C for 10 min. As a result, the average PCE increased to 2.7%, which was one of the highest performing cells among the single-component PSCs, with the Voc of 1.14 V, Jsc of 5.0 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.45. In contrast, the devices based on the blends exhibited a maximum PCE of only 1.0%, optimized at the 1:2 weight ratio of P3HT/PFTBT after annealing at 100 °C for 20 min. Longer annealing times or higher annealing temperatures lead to a drop in performance, and it was thought to be due to a macroscopic phase separation. The resonant soft X-ray scattering indicated that the block copolymer was self-assembled into lamellar micro-domains with an individual domain spacing of approximately 9 nm after annealing at 165 °C, which was comparable to the exciton diffusion length in the organic semiconductor (around 10 nm).58 The GIWAXS results revealed that the P3HT block in P16 presented a face-on rich structure, which differs from the reported edge-on structure.
It is worth noting that P3 was also applied to PSC devices as a single-component material in the active layer.43,44 In fact, the PSC device showed a high PCE of 2.5%, possibly due to the balanced ratio of the P3HT and PCBM blocks and the high mobility of PCBM as compared to the n-type polymers. Nevertheless, the devices based on P3 also showed good thermal stability, similar to that of the all-polymer solar cells.
4 Concluding remarks
In the past two years, significant progress has been achieved in the synthesis of all-conjugated D–A block copolymers. Four approaches are classified in this review, as follows: (1) sequential monomer addition method by the chain-growth catalyst-transfer polycondensation; (2) end-functional polymer combination (grafting-to) method, in which end-functional P3HTs and end-functional n-type polymers are used; (3) end-functional polymer copolymerization method, in which end-functional P3HT is copolymerized with n-type monomers via Suzuki, Yamamoto, or Stille coupling polycondensations, etc.; and (4) macroinitiator (grafting-from) method via catalyst-transfer polycondensation initiated by acceptor polymers (macroinitiators). Some of the block copolymers have been used in all-polymer solar cells, and as surfactants, electron acceptor materials and even single-component active-layer materials. A PCE of 2.7% has been reported using the all-conjugated D–A block copolymer as the single component material, which is the highest value based on the all-polymer solar cells currently available. Moreover, the thermal stability of the PSCs based on block copolymers is better than that based on polymer blends. These results suggest a bright future for all-polymer solar cells based on the all-conjugated D–A block copolymers. On the other hand, although several kinds of all-conjugated D–A block copolymers have been synthesized, the donor block is limited to P3HT. It is still a challenge to incorporate other types of donor blocks into the block copolymers. However, with the development of new approaches to synthesize all-conjugated block copolymers with other donor blocks, rather than P3HT, a wide variety of all-conjugated block copolymers will be produced without limitation, accompanied by higher PCEs for the all-polymer solar cells.
