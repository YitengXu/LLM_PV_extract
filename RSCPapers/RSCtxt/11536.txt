    , Accepted 16th April 2015First published on 16th April 2015AbstractA series of new (DD′AD′DA′)-constituted conjugated polymers were synthesized via C–H arylation with the aid of a Pd(OAc)2/Bu4NBr catalytic system. The polymers are based on 4,7-bis(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (HT.BT.HT), which alternated with 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as a second donor and a lactam- and/or imide-containing material as a second acceptor. The synthesis methodology avoided the drawbacks of Stille and Suzuki coupling and obtained high yields. All of the new polymers possessed broader absorption windows with low energy bandgaps (1.34–1.64 eV), as well as low-lying HOMO energy levels. The prescreening of these polymers as an active material in bulk heterojunction solar cells was investigated and a power conversion efficiency of 2.36% was achieved.
Introduction
In the last couple of decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have received much of attention due to several advantages such as being environmentally friendly and lightweight while having a large area and being inexpensive, easily produced and flexible.1–3 Organic conjugated polymers are the essential active materials for PSCs. Changing either the structure design and synthesis methodology of organic polymers are the most important methods for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE). For the structure design, the donor–acceptor (D–A) system is the most important and popular structure constitution, which has shown promising results in this research area due to an observed PCE up to 9%.4 This simple polymer structure offers several combinations between donor and acceptor cores to obtain the proper D–A combination to achieve both a low bandgap and a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).5 Introducing two more thiophene units along the backbone structure delivers a (DADD′) conformation,6,10e which enhances the delocalization of π-electrons, decreases the steric hindrance between donor and acceptor moieties, and maintains the planar polymer structure. As a result, this class of materials has a broad absorption and high hole mobility.7 Moreover, the propagation of two different electron accepting units with one donor material in an alternating system to form a (DADA′) constitution results in a highly planar structure with strong interchain interactions, which enhances the mobilities of the holes and electrons.8 Furthermore, tunneling of the polymer absorption window and the HOMO energy level has been achieved from random copolymerization of different monomer units to obtain several structure constitutions such as (DAD)–(D′),9a (DA)–(DD′),9b (DA)–(DA′),9c–e (DA)–(AA′),9f and interesting (DA)–(D′A′) based polymers.9g Most of these random polymers showed relatively high short-circuit currents (Jsc), as well as reasonable PCE (3–6%), even if we cannot compare these efficiencies directly because of different device structures. All of the previous research efforts show the importance of the structure–property relationship.
In parallel, polymer synthesis methodologies to obtain pure, high molecular weight polymer products with a low polydispersity index (PDI) have received increased interest. Stille coupling polymerization is the most popular method to offer D–A alternating polymers, which originated from the coupling between dibromo monomers and trialkylstannyl-terminated monomers.10 In addition to its broad scope and reliability, it has several advantages such as the ability to prepare random and block polymers, and generate several types of conjugated polymers as well as a moderate nature.11–13 However, this method also has several shortcomings such as difficulty preparing and reproducing toxic stannane monomers on a large scale, contamination of the palladium catalyst into the net product and harmful environmental effects.14,15 The Suzuki coupling reaction is more favored than the Stille reaction; however, it is a highly complicated reaction due to its multiphase nature and the instability of boronic monomers.16 To overcome the drawbacks of Stille and Suzuki reactions, a direct C–H heteroarylation cross coupling methodology has recently been developed, which involves the synthesis of co-monomers and low molecular weight oligomers. Thus, bi-functional monomers were needed for the preparation of alternating copolymers.17 In addition, this methodology reduces the toxic byproducts, avoids the synthesis of organometallic monomers, and reduces the PDI values, which indicates an increase in the purity of the polymer products that is expected to improve the organic photovoltaic (OPV) performance.18 Based on our previous work,10e the introduction of 4-hexylthiophene moiety to a (DAD) system based on [2,1,3]-benzothiadiazole (BT) as an acceptor and 3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene (EDOT) as a donor improved the planarity and π-electron delocalization length along the backbone of the obtained co-monomer, which has a (DD′AD′D) conformation.
In this study, this planar co-monomer, which has terminal EDOT units with highly reactive C–H sites, was reacted with a series of dibromo derivatives of lactam and/or imide containing electron-accepting compounds via a Pd-catalyzed C–H hetero-arylation polymerization methodology.18d,e This method resulted in a new series of (DD′AD′DA′) alternating co-polymers containing two different acceptors (BT and lactam and/or imide compounds) interchanged with two different adjacent donors (hexylthiophene and EDOT) along the polymer backbone, which ensured planar structure backbone, high ICT from the donor to acceptor9g and strong push–pull D–A system. This system was expected to obtain high internal quantum efficiency (IQE), as well as a high short-circuit current (Jsc) and a low-lying HOMO. The effect of changing the second acceptor (A′) on the optical, electrochemical, and physical properties, surface morphology and photovoltaic potential was studied.
Experimental
Instrumentation and materials

1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian spectrometer (300 MHz and 400 MHz). UV/Vis absorption spectra were obtained using a Varian Cary UV/Vis/NIR-5000 spectrophotometer on the pure polymer samples. The thermal degradation temperature was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-TA Q-50 instrument) under nitrogen. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed using a TA instrument (DSC-TA Q-20) under nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed using a B-class solar simulator: potentiostat/galvanostat (SP-150 OMA company); the supporting electrolyte was tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile (0.1 M), and the scan rate was 50 mV s−1. A three-electrode cell was used; a Pt wire and silver/silver chloride [Ag in KCl (0.1 M)] were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. XRD experiments were performed using a Bruker D8 advanced model diffractometer and with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.542 Å) at a generator voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis was conducted using a Shimadzu (LC-20A Prominence Series) instrument; chloroform was used as the carrier solvent (flow rate: 1 mL min−1, 40 °C), and calibration curves were produced with the aid of standard polystyrene samples.
Materials
Unless otherwise declared, all reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial stores then dried by standard procedures before use. All sensitive reactions were performed under nitrogen atmosphere and monitored using thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Merck silica gel 60 (particle size 230–400 mesh, ASTM). 4,7-Bis(5-bromo-4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTT) (1),19a 2-tributylstannyl-3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene (2),19b 2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-di(5-bromothien-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-(2H,5H)-dione (ODDPP) (4),19c–e 6,6′-dibromo-N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo (ODID) (5)19d,f,h and 1,3-dibromo-5-hexylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (HTPD) (6)19g were prepared using literature procedures.

Device fabrication
The polymer solar cell structure consisted of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC70BM(1:2)/MoO3/Ag and was fabricated as follows: the ITO-coated glass substrate was carefully cleaned with detergent and then ultra-sonicated in deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 30 min each. The cleaned ITO substrate was dried overnight in an oven at 80 °C. The dried ITO substrate was treated with UV/ozone for 15 min. ZnO was spun-cast at 5000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 200 °C for 10 min. After cooling, the casted thin films were transferred into a glove box. The polymer:PC70BM (1:1) blend in chlorobenzene was spin-coated at 1200–2000 rpm for 70 s and then annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. A certain volume of DIO was added as a processing additive to the blend solutions when needed. After cooling, all the cells were transferred into a metal deposition chamber. Finally, the MoO3 (10 nm thickness) and Ag (120 nm thickness) electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (3 × 10−6 Torr). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured under air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) illumination from a calibrated solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 using a Keithley 236 source measure unit (SMU).
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of new polymers
All of the new polymers based on 4,7-bis(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (HT·BT·HT) as the building block were prepared. The corresponding dibromo derivative was obtained across three steps beginning with the bromination of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and ending with the bromination of (HT·BT·HT) to obtain 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (1) via our recently reported procedures,10e,19a as shown in Scheme 1. By Stille coupling, compound (1) was coupled with 2-tributylstannyl-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (2) and 4,7-bis[5′-(3,4-ethylenedioxythienyl)-4-hexylthiophen-2-yl]-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (EDBTT) (3) was obtained in 78% yield. The presence of an ethylene dioxy-directing group granted an EDOT moiety in the 2 and 2′ positions in high reactivity and selectivity towards any heteroaryl halides, which easily underwent direct C–H arylation.20 As a result, via the Pd(OAc)2/(Bu)4NBr catalytic system, compound 3 was coupled to three different imide containing electron accepting units, 2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-di(5-bromothien-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-(2H,5H)-dione (ODDPP) (4), 6,6′-dibromo-N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)isoindigo (ODID) (5) and\or 1,3-dibromo-5-hexylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (HTPD) (6), to release three different alternating polymers, P(DPPEDBTT), P(IDEDBTT) and P(TPDEDBTT), which were obtained in dark violet, blue and reddish brown colors, respectively. The polymers were obtained in 66–81% yield.

The lactam- and imide-containing acceptors were selected as the second electron-accepting units because the alkylated lactam and/or imide improved the solubility of the polymers and the high electronegativity of the imide group induced a high dipole moment, which enhanced the planarity along the polymer backbone structure as well as the interchain interactions between the polymer chains. Thus, the effective participation of pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-(2H,5H)-dione (DPP),21N,N′-bis(2-alkyl)isoindigo (ID)22 and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD)17a,23 functioned as important electron-withdrawing, building block, organic, conjugated polymers for optoelectronic applications. In addition, the presence of an alkylated imide group improved the solubility characteristics such that all of the new polymers were easily dissolved in common organic solvents such as chloroform (CF), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and tetrahydrofuran (THF). The molecular weights and PDIs of all polymers were measured using gel permeation chromatography at 40 °C using CF as the eluent. The weight average molecular weights (Mw) of P(DPPEDBTT), P(IDEDBTT) and P(TPDEDBTT) were 17.4, 25.7 and 18.9 kg mol−1 with PDI estimated to be 1.76, 1.55 and 1.63, respectively. All the polymers showed high thermal stability. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) indicated that the 5% decomposition temperatures under nitrogen atmosphere were in the range of 250–393 °C (Fig. 1a). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results did not indicate definite values of the glass transition and melting temperatures. The high thermal stability of these polymers is essential for their application in optoelectronic devices.

X-ray diffractions (XRD) of the new polymers were measured from thin films cast on glass substrates (Fig. 1b). All the polymers showed one peak in the narrow-angle region, which indicated the arrangement of the alkyl chains in the solid state. These peaks were estimated to be at 2θ = 4.01° (22.02 Å) for P(DPPEDBTT), 4.03° (21.91 Å) for P(IDEDBTT) and 4.54° (19.46 Å) for P(TPDEDBTT) (Fig. 1b). The XRD results imply that all the polymers possess planar-structured backbones but lack well-arranged aggregation in the solid state because the various types of alkyl chains disturbed the polymer arrangement. Thus, no π–π stacking diffraction peaks were assigned. P(DPPEDBTT) offered two more peaks at 5.9° (15.0 Å) and 7.80° (11.4 Å) in the narrow-angle region, which indicated the contribution of the hexyl chains in the arrangement that was expected to improve the surface morphology.
Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of all of the new polymers in CF at room temperature and as cast films are shown in Fig. 2 and the characterization data are summarized in Table 1. P(TPDEDBTT) showed a narrow absorption window, especially in a solution at λmax = 490 nm due to the small size of the TPD unit. Otherwise, this polymer offered a large red shift in the film. Its absorption spectrum was much broader, from 490 to 579 nm, which indicates the good arrangement of the P(TPDEDBTT) film. In contrast, the similar structural conformation between DTDPP and ID reflected the similarity of the absorption spectra of the corresponding polymers P(DPPEDBTT) and P(IDEDBTT) in a solution with λmax = 648 and 629 nm, respectively. In the films, the DTDPP unit extended the effective conjugation length along the backbone due to the presence of two additional thiophene moieties around the DPP unit. As a result, P(DPPEDBTT) showed a broader red shift than P(IDEDBTT) at λmax = 673 and 634 nm. Interestingly, for all the polymers, the absorption bands in the range of 300–500 nm were smoother in the film than in the solution. In addition, the high energy absorption bands related to the π–π* transition in the range of 500–900 nm all showed red shifts, implying high ICT between the donors and acceptors along the backbone, which originated from the structure compatibility inside the repeating units and the good ordering in the solid state. The optical bandgaps (Eg,opt) of P(DPPEDBTT), P(IDEDBTT) and P(TPDEDBTT) were 1.34, 1.47 and 1.64 eV, respectively, which were proportional to the absorption onsets (λonset) of the three polymers as thin films at 923, 842 and 755 nm, respectively.

Electrochemical properties
As shown in Fig. 3, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels for all the polymers were determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis of thin, drop-cast films of P(DPPEDBTT), P(IDEDBTT) and P(TPDEDBTT) on a platinum electrode in 0.1 M of Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1versus an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The data are summarized in Table 1. All the polymers obtained deep lying HOMO energy levels in the range from −5.64 to −5.21 eV, which were suitable for good air stability and high open circuit voltages (Voc) in OPV device applications.24 The onset oxidation potentials (Eox) that referred to the oxidation of the donor units of P(DPPEDBTT), P(IDEDBTT) and P(TPDEDBTT) were assigned at 0.51, 0.96 and 0.62 eV, respectively, and the HOMO energy levels of polymers were calculated according to the equation EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.71) (eV). The optical LUMO energy levels were calculated according to the equation ELUMO = (EHOMO + Eg,opt) and were found to be −3.87, −4.17 and −3.68 eV for P(DPPEDBTT), P(IDEDBTT) and P(TPDEDBTT), respectively.

Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the newly synthesized polymers, we fabricated bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with a conventional device architecture: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer:PC60BM(1:1)/Al. The devices were tested under an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. As shown in the ESI,† S2, all devices showed poor performance because of the low absorption of PC60BM in the visible range. To improve the performance of BHJ solar cells with our polymers, we changed the device architecture and acceptor material to an inverted device structure and PC70BM, respectively.
The inverted device architecture consisted of ITO/ZnO/Polymer:PC70BM(1:1)/MoO3/Ag. In addition, to enhance the performance of BHJ solar cells, we also introduced a small quantity (∼3 vol%) of the processing additive, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (see ESI,† Fig. S1 and S2). It is well known that the processing additive can improve the surface morphology of BHJ film, thereby enhancing the performance of BHJ solar cells dramatically.4a,25 All photovoltaic parameters of BHJ solar cells are summarized in Table 2.

In spite of its high short circuit current density (Jsc) of 8.30 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 0.32, the BHJ cell based on P(DPPEDBTT) showed the lowest power conversion efficiency PCE = 0.69%, due to its low open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.26 V. The P(TPDEDBTT)-based BHJ cell showed the best FF of 0.35 and Voc of 0.51 V, which yielded 1.18% of PCE with Jsc of 6.69 mA cm−2. The best PCE was obtained in the P(IDEDBTT)-based BHJ cell with 1.59% PCE, which is mainly due to having both the highest Voc of 0.72 V originating from its deep HOMO (−5.64 eV) and good Jsc of 8.19 mA cm−2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for all devices are shown in Fig. 4a–c.

To improve the photovoltaic performance, the processing additive, DIO4a with a certain volume ratio (3%)26 was added into the solution of the polymer:PC70BM, as shown in Fig. 4. In general, the addition of DIO improved the π–π stacking distance between polymer chains, which are defined as the breadth of the π–π stacking diffraction peaks at about 2θ = 20.23° and 20.09°, which correspond to a d-spacing of ∼4.46 and 4.45 Å for P(DPPEDBTT) and P(IDEDBTT). P(TPDEDBTT) showed two π–π stacking diffraction peaks at about 2θ = 19.56° and 21.56° corresponding to a d-spacing of ∼4.61 and 4.19 Å (Fig. 4d–f). As a result of this morphological change, the FF of P(DPPEDBTT) was slightly enhanced from 0.32 to 0.36. Based on the inverse relationship between the Jsc and the domain size,27 polymers:PC70BM with DIO showed small-sized crystalline domains with a root mean-square (rms) roughness of 1.22–2.75 nm (Fig. 5), which reflected the dramatic increases in observed the Jsc beside the increased interfacial area between polymer and PC70BM.25 As shown in Fig. 4b, the P(IDEDBTT):PC70BM organic photovoltaic device exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency of 2.36% with a Jsc of 11.75 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.73 V and a FF of 0.27. Thus, the PCEs of P(DPPEDBTT) and P(TPDEDBTT) were enhanced to 1.20% and 2.08%, respectively, as shown in Table 2.

Conclusions
A new series alternating copolymers based on two different donors and two different acceptors units (DD′AD′DA′) were designed and successfully synthesized via direct C–H arylation. The Pd(OAc)2/Bu4NBr catalytic system was suitable to easily polymerize the molecules and avoid the drawbacks of Stille and Suzuki coupling because it does not require the synthesis of bi-functionalized organometallic monomers. As a result, the synthesis and purification of the conjugated polymers were fast and easy. In addition, reasonable yields of 66–81% were obtained. 4,7-Bis(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTT) units alternated with 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) units to ensure a planar structure of the copolymers and of the alkylated 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-(2H,5H)-dione (DPP), N,N′-bis(2-alkyl)isoindigo (ID) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) lactam- and imide-containing moieties, which were used as second electron-withdrawing cores. They guaranteed deep highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels in the range from −5.21 to −5.64 eV, as well as improved polymer solubility. All the polymers achieved low bandgaps in the range of 1.37–1.64 eV. A preliminary evaluation of the potential of these copolymers as donor materials in organic photovoltaic cells has been tested and improved by addition of (∼3 vol%) the processing additive, 1,8-diiodooctane. The highest photovoltaic performance was achieved using P(IDEDBTT)/PC70BM, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of ∼2.36%. New photovoltaic device configurations, thermal treatment and the addition of processing additives will be studied to improve the fill factor as well as the power conversion efficiency.
