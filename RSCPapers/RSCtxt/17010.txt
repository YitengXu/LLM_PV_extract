    , Accepted 17th December 2019First published on 19th December 2019AbstractAlthough perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2% in a very short period of development, they suffer from poor stability because the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials are easily decomposed under the attacks of oxygen, moisture, heat and ultraviolet light. It is demonstrated that an all inorganic perovskite material of CsPbBr3 has excellent stability against moisture, oxygen and heat, but it has a slightly wide bandgap of 2.3 eV, which seriously hinders light absorption and leads to poor PCE. Metal ion doping is a good approach to overcome this drawback because it can effectively tune the bandgap, enhance light absorption, suppress trap states and adjust the energy level. Here, we use the CoBr2 doping route to fabricate high quality and crystallinity CoBr2 doped CsPbBr3 film. As a result, a champion device with the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film yields a PCE as high as 8.57%, much higher than that of the pristine CsPbBr3 one (6.81%). It is found that the lower number of trap defects and higher carrier density of the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film are key reasons for the enhancement because they bring about better charge carrier dynamics and suppressed dark recombination.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous interest due to their rocketing power conversion efficiency (PCE) to the highest certified value of 25.2% in a very short period of development.1,2 However, the PSCs suffer from poor stability because the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials are easy decomposed under the attacks of oxygen, moisture, heat and ultraviolet light. So, improving long-term stability of PSCs is a prerequisite for their practical application.3,4 Substituting organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials with all inorganic ones such as CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3 is an effective way to enhance the stability of PSCs.5,6 Although CsPbI3 has a suitable bandgap of 1.73 eV, it easily degrades from the perovskite phase of α-CsPbI3 to the nonperovskite phase of δ-CsPbI3 at room temperature, leading to quick attenuation of photovoltaic performance.7 In contrast, CsPbBr3 shows excellent stability against moisture, oxygen and heat, but it has a slightly wide bandgap of 2.3 eV, which seriously hinders light absorption and leads to poor PCE.
Metal ion doping is a good approach to obviously improve photovoltaic performance of CsPbBr3 PSCs because it can effectively tune the bandgap, enhance light absorption, suppress trap states and adjust the energy level.8,9 Tang's group reported the lattice doping of lanthanide ions to enlarge the grain size of CsPbBr3 films and prolong carrier lifetimes, yielding a high PCE of 10.14% and an ultrahigh open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.594 V of the CsPb0.97Sm0.03Br3 PSCs;10 they also used perovskite divalent hard Lewis acids (Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ba2+) to dope CsPbBr3 films and achieved a champion CsPb0.97Sr0.03Br3 device with a PCE as high as 9.63%;11 recently, they used M-substituted (M = Ba2+, Ca2+, or Ni2+) Cu(Cr,M)O2 nanocrystals as efficient HTMs in all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs and achieved a champion PCE as high as 10.18%;12 they also found that the precise stress control of CsPbBr3 films could generate an ultrahigh voltage of 1.622 V and a high efficiency of 10.71%.13 Guo et al. found that doping CsPbBr3 with SnBr2 brought about more continuous and nonporous films, a modified band structure and accelerated chare transport of CsPbBr3 layers, resulting in an efficiency improvement from 6.85% to 8.63% of the corresponding devices.14
In this work, we used CoBr2 doping to improve the quality and crystallinity of a CsPbBr3 film. As a result, obviously enhanced photovoltaic performance of the CoBr2 doped CsPbBr3 planar PSCs is achieved and a champion device with the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film yields a PCE as high as 8.57%, a 25.84% enhancement compared with that of the pristine CsPbBr3 one (6.81%). The obvious enhancement of photovoltaic performance is mainly attributed to the lower trap defects and higher carrier density of the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film, which further result in better charge carrier dynamics and suppressed dark recombination in the corresponding device.
Experimental
Materials
PbBr2 (99%), CsBr (99%) and CoBr2 (99%) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp, China. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.9%), methanol (99.9%), chlorobenzene (99.9%) and isopropoxide (99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis(N,N-p-dimethoxy-phenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD, 99.8%) was supplied by Luminescence Technology Corp, Taiwan, China. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification. The TiO2 nanocrystals for preparing electron transport layers (ETLs) were synthesized by the method reported in the literature.15 The indium tin oxide (ITO) conductive glasses with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1 (Nippon Glass Corp, Japan) were used as substrates.
Fabrication of solar cells
ITO was consecutively cleaned by detergent, ethanol, and UV-ozone treatment. TiO2 ETLs were prepared on the laser-patterned and cleaned ITOs with a size of 1.5 × 1.5 cm2. Firstly, the TiO2 NC ethanol solution (6 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on ITO at 5000 rpm for 30 s and heated at 150 °C for 2 min; soon afterward, it was spin-coated once again and heated at 150 °C for 30 min. Secondly, CsPbBr3 layers were deposited on the TiO2 ETLs by a modified multistep spin-coating technique according to the literature and Scheme 1.16 In detail, 1.0 M PbBr2 DMF solution was heated at 75 °C until the solution became clear and transparent, whereby CoBr2 was dissolved in PbBr2 solution with mole ratios of 0.001/0.999, 0.002/0.998 and 0.003/0.997 versus PbBr2 for preparing CsPb0.999Co0.001Br3, CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 and CsPb0.997Co0.003Br3 films, respectively, and the substrates with TiO2 ETLs were preheated at 75 °C in advance. Then, the PbBr2 solution was spin-coated on the substrates at a speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s and heated at 90 °C for 50 min. The formed PbBr2 films were completely immersed in a 0.07 M CsBr methanol solution at a temperature of 55 °C for 15 min, washed with isopropyl alcohol at a speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s, heated at 250 °C for 5 min, followed by one time spin-coating of CsBr solution at a speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s, and heated again at 250 °C for 5 min. The whole fabrication process of the CsPbBr3 films was conducted in air. Thirdly, the Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layers and Au electrodes were prepared by the same methods as in our former repor.17

Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Multimode 8) were used to observe the morphologies of CsPbBr3 films. An X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) (Bruker D8 Advance) was used to detect the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. A photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250 Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to measure the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra of the samples. An energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, Oxford Inca) was used to characterize the elements in the samples. A UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer (Lambda 950) was used to measure UV-Vis absorption spectra. A fluorescence spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Lumina) was used to acquire the steady-state photoluminescence (PL). An Omin-λ Monochromator/Spectrograph (Zolix) with the time-correlated single-photon counting method (Pico harp 300) was used to record the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra. The TRPL decay curves were fitted by a bi-exponential equation (eqn (1)) as follows:18 (1)where Ai is the decay amplitude and τi is the decay time. The average PL decay time (τave) can be calculated with the fitted Ai and τi values as follows (eqn (2)):19 (2)
A PVIV-94043A (Newport, USA) solar simulator with AM 1.5 G and 100 mW cm−2 solar illumination, which was adjusted using a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with a KG-2 filter, combined with a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter, was used to measure the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs. The incident-photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were measured using an Enli tech QE-R666 IPCE system. The stabilized current density and power output were recorded close to the maximum power point, which was extracted from the J–V curves. The trap state density (Nt) within CsPbBr3 layers was evaluated by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method with an electron-only architecture of ITO/TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Au.20 The Nt can be calculated with the following equation (eqn (3)): (3)where VTFL is the onset voltage of the trap filled limit, q is the elementary charge of electron (q = 1.60 × 10−19 C), L is the thickness of the deposited perovskite film, ε0 represents the vacuum permittivity (ε0 = 8.85 × 10−12 F m−1) and εr represents the relative dielectric constant (εr = 16.46).21
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 depicts top-view SEM images of the CsPbBr3 and CoBr2 doped CsPbBr3 films (CsPb0.999Co0.001Br3, CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 and CsPb0.997Co0.003Br3). One can see that the CsPbBr3 film exhibits a rough surface with clear CsPbBr3 crystal grain boundaries, and some pin holes appear in the film owing to the great variety of CsPbBr3 crystal grain sizes. In contrast, the CoBr2 doped CsPbBr3 films show obviously enhanced quality because the surface of the films becomes smoother; for instance, the root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film is lower than that of the CsPbBr3 film (41.5 nm vs. 51.5 nm) from the AFM images, as shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI,† and the CoBr2 doped CsPbBr3 crystal grains stack more compactly, leading to the disappearance of pin holes.

Fig. 2a shows XRD patterns of the CsPbBr3 and CoBr2 doped CsPbBr3 films. One can find that there is no significant difference in the XRD patterns of the CoBr2 doped and undoped samples. The characteristic diffraction peaks of CsPbBr3 crystals are located at 15.2°, 21.7°, 26.5°, 30.4° and 38.1°, corresponding to the (100), (110), (111), (200) and (211) planes, respectively.22 Although the CoBr2 dopant does not change the main diffraction peaks of CsPbBr3 crystals in the CoBr2 doped samples, it can improve crystallinity owing to the enhanced diffraction intensity of the (110) plane in the CoBr2 doped ones compared with the undoped one. Specifically, the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film achieves the highest degree of crystallinity because of the strongest diffraction intensity at 21.7°, and the growth of CsPb2Br5 crystals is suppressed due to the weakest diffraction peak at 11.8°. Therefore, the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film has higher quality than the pristine CsPbBr3 film, which leads to enhanced light absorption, as shown in Fig. 2b.

The XPS spectra (Fig. 3) and EDS element mappings (Fig. 4) are supplied for confirming the successful doping of Co2+ ions in the CsPbBr3 film. Specifically, due to the very low doping concentration of CoBr2, the sample with a 10-fold higher concentration of CoBr2 is used for measuring the XPS spectrum of Co 2p. It can be seen that the peak positions of Cs 3d, Pb 4f and Br 3d elements of the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film shift to slightly higher binding energies compared with those of the pristine CsPbBr3 film, mainly attributed to the redistributed electron density by introducing a stronger electronegativity of Co2+ ions than that of Pb2+ ions.14 The EDS element mappings were obtained from the cross-section of the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 planar PSC. One can see that the Co element is randomly dispersed in the sample and shows much lower concentration than the other elements.

Fig. 5a shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 planar PSC. The functional layers including the TiO2 ETL, CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 layer, Spiro-OMeTAD layer and Au electrode can be clearly identified. Fig. 5b presents the corresponding energy levels of the functional layers, which are obtained from their UPS spectra and Tauc plots, as shown in Fig. S2–S4 and Table S1 of the ESI† and ref. 15 and 23. The data reveal that the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 layer shows a slight difference of energy level with that of the pristine CsPbBr3 film and can form a suitable energy level alignment for light to electricity conversion of the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 planar PSC.

Photovoltaic performance of the CoBr2 doped and undoped CsPbBr3 planar PSCs was evaluated by using J–V curves, as shown in Fig. S5 and Table S2 of the ESI.† It can be seen that the Co2+ dopant can indeed optimize all photovoltaic parameters including open-circuit voltage (Voc), current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE of the devices, and the champion one is fabricated with the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film. For clearly presenting the enhancement, J–V curves and corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the CsPbBr3 and CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 planar PSCs are shown in Fig. 5c. One can see that the CsPbBr3 planar PSC yields a PCE of 6.81% with a Voc of 1.301 V, a Jsc of 6.79 mA cm−2 and a FF of 77.08%; conversely, the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 planar PSC achieves a higher PCE of 8.57% with a Voc of 1.357 V, a Jsc of 7.45 mA cm−2 and a FF of 84.84%. The integrated Jscs (6.68 versus 7.28 mA cm−2) from IPCE data shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) are consistent with those ones from the J–V curves. Moreover, the latter one also achieves a higher steady-state output of Jsc and PCE than those of the pristine device (6.97 mA cm−2versus 5.61 mA cm−2, and 6.27% versus 8.01%, respectively), as shown in Fig. 5d.
The obviously enhanced photovoltaic performance of the CoBr2 doped CsPbBr3 planar PSCs mainly originates from the improved quality of the CoBr2 doped CsPbBr3 films as aforementioned, which may lead to better charge transport dynamics and suppressed dark recombination.24 It is found that the steady-state PL emission peaks of the CoBr2 doped CsPbBr3 films all become stronger than those of the pristine CsPbBr3 film, as revealed by Fig. S7a of the ESI,† suggesting less non-radiative recombination in the CoBr2 doped samples compared with the pristine one. The TRPL spectra and the related parameters as shown in Fig. S7b and Table S3 of the ESI† further confirm the reduced non-radiative recombination of photo-generated carriers in the CoBr2 doped CsPbBr3 films owing to the enhanced PL decay lifetime.25 Specifically, the maximum enhanced PL intensity and PL decay lifetime are achieved by the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film, so its PL and TRPL spectra together with those of the pristine CsPbBr3 film are individually shown in Fig. 6a and b. We can see that the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film yields a 19.47% enhancement of PL emission intensity compared with that of the pristine CsPbBr3 film, and the τave of the former sample is also much higher than that of the latter one (10.71 ns versus 2.55 ns). Additionally, the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film has a lower Nt (8.04 × 1015 cm−3) than that of the pristine CsPbBr3 film (1.02 × 1016 cm−3), as shown in Fig. 6c, showing clearly reduced trap defects due to the enhanced quality and crystallinity of the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film.

The J–V characteristic depending on light intensity was tested in order to better understand the charge recombination mechanism of the CsPbBr3 and CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 planar PSCs. Fig. 6d shows the Jsc plots depending on light intensity. It was calculated that the slope (α) values of the CsPbBr3 and CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 planar PSCs are 0.982 and 0.989, respectively, all close to the standard value (α = 1), indicating good photo response and well suppressed bimolecular recombination in the devices. Nonetheless, the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 planar PSC shows slightly better performance than the CsPbBr3 one.26Fig. 6e shows the Voc plots depending on light intensity. According to ref. 27–29, the light intensity dependence of Voc is responsible for the dominant recombination mechanism in solar cells, that is, the slopes of kT/q and 2kT/q indicate dominant bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination, respectively. One can find that the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 planar PSC has a lower slope (1.34kT/q) than that of the CsPbBr3 planar PSC (slope = 1.75kT/q), revealing weaker trap-assisted recombination in the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 planar PSC. This result is also consistent with the lower Nt of the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film as aforementioned.
The built-in potential (Vbi) and donor density (Nd) of the CsPbBr3 and CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 planar PSCs were analyzed by the Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 6f) via the following eqn (4):30 (4)where C is the depletion layer capacitance, A is the electrode area, q is the electronic charge, ε is the dielectric constant of the sample, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, and V is the applied voltage. The Vbi of the CsPbBr3 and CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 planar PSCs is 1.213 V and 1.302 V, respectively, which was estimated using the intercept of the linear regime with the x-axis of the Mott–Schottky curves.31 The relatively higher Vbi of the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 planar PSC can both more effectively extract the photogenerated carriers and suppress dark recombination compared with the CsPbBr3 planar PSC, leading to a clearly enhanced Voc.32 Moreover, the carrier concentration of the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film is estimated to be 3.31 × 1016 cm−3, also higher than that of the CsPbBr3 film (2.51 × 1015 cm−3) and advantageous to improving photovoltaic performance.
The improved quality and crystallinity of the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film may result in a self-passivation at the grain boundaries, which has a great influence on the photovoltaic performance of the device.33 For identifying the self-passivation at the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 grain boundaries, a surface potential measurement by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) is conducted and the surface potential mappings of the CsPbBr3 and CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 films are displayed in Fig. 7a and b, respectively. We can clearly obverse potential barriers among the grain boundaries of the CsPbBr3 film because of the presented bright regions of grain boundaries and relatively dark regions of crystal grains from Fig. 7a; nevertheless, a comparatively uniform surface potential distribution can be seen in Fig. 7b, indicating lower surface potential barriers among the grain boundaries of the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film. Fig. 7c shows the surface potential line profiles of the CsPbBr3 and CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 films. It can be seen that the contact potential difference (CPD) of the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film is about −780 mV, which is higher than that of the CsPbBr3 film (about −820 mV). Therefore, the KPFM results confirm that the CoBr2 doping leads to a self-passivation at the grain boundaries and optimizes carrier transport behavior in the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film compared with the pristine CsPbBr3 film, which is in accordance with the PL and TRPL results as aforementioned.34

Fig. 8a shows the statistical distribution of PCE from one batch of 20 devices of the CsPbBr3 and CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 planar PSCs, respectively. It can be seen that the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 planar PSCs exhibit good reproducibility, as do the CsPbBr3 ones, and yield a higher average PCE of 7.75 ± 0.23% than that of the latter ones (6.33 ± 0.23%). In addition, the long-term stability evolution of the normalized PCE of the corresponding devices stored in an air environment at different times (Fig. 8b) reveals that the PCEs of the two planar PSCs can both be maintained at up to 95.60% of the original values, demonstrating their excellent stability.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that CoBr2 doping is an effect way to obviously enhance photovoltaic performance of the CsPbBr3 planar PSC. The best-performing planar PSC with the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film achieves a high PCE of 8.57%, much higher than that of the pristine CsPbBr3 device (6.79%). The CoBr2 doped CsPbBr3 films show compact morphologies with almost no pin-holes, as seen in the SEM images; moreover, the crystallinity of these films is also enhanced, especially the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film, as found from XRD patterns. The improved quality and crystallinity bring about fewer trap defects and a higher carrier density of the CsPb0.998Co0.002Br3 film than those of the pristine CsPbBr3 film, as revealed by the SCLC and Mott–Schottky data, which further result in better charge carrier dynamics and suppressed dark recombination, as confirmed by the PL, TRPL, J–V characteristic depending on light intensity, and KPFM data. Therefore, CoBr2 doping is a feasible way for preparing efficient CsPbBr3 planar PSCs.
