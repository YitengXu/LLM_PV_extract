    , Accepted 26th November 2018First published on 27th November 2018AbstractIn this work, we prepared a novel kind of Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ co-doped CsGd(MoO4)2 phosphors with a different structure from the reported ALn(MoO4)2 (A = Li, Na or K; Ln = La, Gd or Y) compounds using a high-temperature solid-state reaction method. X-ray diffraction showed that the as-prepared samples had a pure phase. Based on the efficient energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+/Ho3+, the up-conversion (UC) luminescence of the optimal CsGd(MoO4)2:0.30Yb3+,0.02Er3+ sample showed intensely green light with dominant emission peaks at 528 and 550 nm corresponding to Er3+ transitions 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, respectively, as well as a weak emission peak originating from 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 at 671 nm, under 975 nm laser excitation. The CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Ho3+ samples mainly displayed two emission bands around 540 and 660 nm together with a negligible one at 755 nm, which corresponded to Ho3+ transitions 4F4,5F2 → 5I8, 5F5 → 5I8 and 4F4,5F2 → 5I7, respectively, under 975 nm laser excitation. With increasing Yb3+ concentration in CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Ho3+ phosphors, the emission color could be tuned from orange red to light yellow due to the large energy gap between levels 4F4,5F2 and 5F5. In addition, the CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+ showed green light under 376 nm UV irradiation similar to that upon 975 nm laser excitation. However, the emissions for CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Ho3+ samples under 358 nm UV or 449 nm blue excitation showed dominant emission peaks at 540 nm and weak 660 nm and 752 nm peaks, which were a bit different from those under 975 nm excitation. Interestingly, we observed efficient energy transfer phenomena (possible quantum cutting) from Er3+/Ho3+ to Yb3+ and a Yb3+–O2− charge transfer (CT) transition in the molybdates, which was deduced from the visible and near-infrared emission spectra and the decrease of the Er3+/Ho3+ luminescent lifetimes with increasing Yb3+ concentration in the CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ samples. The luminescence properties of these phosphors suggest their potential possibility for applications in solid-state lighting and displays as well as in c-Si solar energy conversion systems.
1. Introduction
Recently, rare-earth doped luminescent materials have been extensively investigated for their broad applications in many fields such as illumination [displays and light-emitting diodes (LEDs)], solar energy, anti-counterfeiting, sensors, bio-imaging, fluorescent probes, cancer therapeutics and so on.1–10 The luminescence properties of materials are strongly dependent on their hosts, therefore, it is vital to select appropriate hosts for rare-earth ion incorporation to obtain good optical properties. Up to now, in terms of up-conversion (UC) luminescence, hundreds of investigations have concentrated on fluoride, other halide and tellurate glass hosts due to their relatively low phonon energy that can avoid energy loss via non-radiative processes to generate high UC luminescence efficiency.11–15 The most representative matrices in these materials are the fluorides (Na/Li)(Y/Gd/Lu)F4.16–20 However, they suffer many drawbacks such as poor physical, chemical and thermal stabilities, toxicity, hygroscopicity, etc.,21 which limit their broader application. In comparison, oxide compounds generally exhibit better chemical and thermal stabilities as well as low toxicity, which is why they have been studied in parallel with fluoride-based phosphors for their potential application in illumination and displays.22 In view of this, it is essential to search for proper oxide hosts with low phonon characteristics for rare-earth ion doping to realize efficient UC luminescence. Thus many inorganic matrices such as molybdates, tungstates, vanadates, titanates, niobates and other oxides have attracted much attention.23–29 Moreover, these matrices doped with rare earth ions have been reported to have good down-shifting (DS) photoluminescence properties.29,30 Molybdates typically have strong absorption in the UV region, creating the possibility of transferring the excitation energy to the doped rare earth ions to enhance the luminescence properties of the resulting phosphors. Among them, one group of compounds with the formula ALn(MO4)2 (A = alkali metal ions; Ln = trivalent rare-earth ions; M = Mo, W) and scheelite-like (CaWO4) structure have been investigated as efficient UC and DS luminescent materials recently.22,31–35 We observed that the crystallographic system for these previous host structures generally belonged to the tetragonal system, which is different from the monoclinic system of CsGd(MoO4)2 with the same ALn(MO4)2 formula.36 Recently, therefore, Balaji et al.37 studied the photoluminescence and energy transfer properties of Dy3+/Eu3+ doped CsGd(MoO4)2 phosphors which showed a tunable emission color. However, the UC and DS luminescence properties with Yb3+, Er3+/Ho3+ incorporation in this host have never been investigated before, which is suggested for solid-state lighting and displays.
It is common that Er3+ and Ho3+ are the most important activators in rare-earth ion doped UC luminescent materials due to their abundant energy levels and the possibility to convert near-infrared (NIR) light to visible light.38 However, the absorption cross-sections for these two ions are low and result in a weak UC emission intensity under direct NIR excitation. Moreover, high doping concentrations will bring about the concentration quenching effect, weakening the emission intensity. Therefore, a sensitizer Yb3+ is often utilized as a co-dopant because of its larger absorption cross-section around 975 nm and matching energy levels for efficient energy transfer to Er3+ and Ho3+ ions.39 With the assistance of Yb3+ ions, the UC emission intensities of Er3+ and Ho3+ ions can be greatly enhanced.
In this work, we co-doped Yb3+ and Er3+/Ho3+ into the CsGd(MoO4)2 matrix to realize efficient UC luminescence. We found that the as-prepared materials showed typical UC luminescence spectra with a bright green color for CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+ and a tunable color from orange red to light yellow for CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Ho3+ with increasing Yb3+ concentration upon 975 nm laser excitation. In addition, the DS luminescence spectrum for CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+ is similar to the UC one in the visible region while it is a little different for the CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Ho3+ samples. Attractively, we observed successive energy transfer (possible quantum cutting effects) from Er3+/Ho3+ to Yb3+ and a Yb3+–O2− CT transition in these CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ materials, which has been rarely studied and observed in ALn(MO4)2-type luminescent materials. These effects can be beneficial for improving the conversion efficiency of c-Si solar cells via efficiently realizing the conversion of UV or blue light to near-infrared. The results illustrate that mutual energy transfer can be realized in suitable Yb3+ and Er3+/Ho3+ doped molybdates, which suggests their bi-functionality for UC and DS solid-state lighting and displays and solar energy conversion systems.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Material preparation
In a typical process, a series of samples with the formula CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ were prepared using a high-temperature solid-state reaction method. The raw materials Cs2CO3 (A.R.), Gd2O3 (99.9%), MoO3 (A.R.), Yb2O3 (99.9%), Er2O3 (99.9%) and Ho2O3 (99.9%) were first weighed according to the corresponding stoichiometric ratio and ground to a fine powder with the proper addition of ethanol using an agate mortar along with a pestle for 15 min. Then, the mixture was dried in an oven and transferred to a ceramic crucible for annealing for 5 h in a furnace at 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Finally, the product was cooled within the furnace and reground for another 1 min to be used for subsequent characterization.
2.2 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted using a Thermo Scientific ARLX’TRA diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα source (λ = 1.5405 Å). Raman spectra were collected on FT-IR-RAMAN-DRIFT NICOLET 6700 equipment. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were conducted on an Edinburgh Instruments FLSP 920 UV-vis-NIR spectrofluorimeter. For the DS experiments, including near-infrared emission, a 450 W xenon lamp was used as the excitation source. For the UC luminescence measurements, a continuous-wave diode laser (400 mW) at 975 nm was employed as the steady-state excitation source. The setup has a Hamamatsu R928P red-sensitive photomultiplier tube (PMT) to detect luminescence in the 200–870 nm wavelength range, and a liquid-nitrogen cooled (−80 °C) Hamamatsu R5509-72 PMT to detect near-infrared luminescence up to 1700 nm. Luminescence decay curves were recorded using a 60 W pulsed xenon lamp (pulse rate 100 Hz) for the DS measurements, and a Continuum Surelite I-10 Nd: YAG pumped OPO Plus laser with the excitation wavelength fixed at 975 nm, with a pulse rate of 10 Hz, for the UC measurements.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Phase identification, crystal structure, FT-IR and Raman spectra
The XRD patterns for the as-prepared CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ samples are presented in Fig. 1a. All the profiles could be assigned to the CsGd(MoO4)2 compound with the standard JCPDS card no. 41-0419. No other impurities were found, indicating little influence on the crystal structure after incorporating Yb3+ and Er3+/Ho3+ ions into the matrix. The corresponding crystal structure of the CsGd(MoO4)2 compound is shown in Fig. 1b. It crystallizes in monoclinic symmetry with the space group P12/c1 (13) and lattice parameters a = 9.5288(2) Å, b = 5.0823(2) Å, c = 8.0563(7) Å, β = 91.25(1)°, V = 390.06(6) Å3, and Z = 2. The Cs, Gd and Mo atoms are coordinated with eight, seven and four oxygen atoms to form their respective polyhedra, which are marked in corresponding cyan, brown and grey colors here. As proposed, the Gd3+ sites are occupied by Yb3+ and Er3+/Ho3+ ions due to their close ionic radii and same valence. Detailed ionic radius values are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The differences of ionic radius between doped and substituted ions should not exceed 30%,40 which can be evaluated using the following equation:41 (1)where Dr is the difference of radius percentage; CN is the coordination number; and Rm(CN) and Rd(CN) are the radii of the host cations and the doped ions, respectively. In view of the values in Table S1 (ESI†), we can infer that the substitution of Gd3+ by Yb3+ and Er3+/Ho3+ ions is reasonable in this kind of phosphors.

The Raman spectrum in the 100–1300 cm−1 range for the CsGd(MoO4)2 host is presented in Fig. 2. Several peaks can be observed, among which the 950 and 933 cm−1 signals correspond to the symmetric stretching vibration of the (MoO4)2− group, whereas the two bands around 858 and 810 cm−1 should be attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the (MoO4)2− group. Four other bands in the range 300–500 cm−1 can be assigned to the asymmetric bending vibration of the (MoO4)2− group.42,43 Several bands below 300 cm−1 were found originating from the translational motion of Cs, Gd and Mo atoms.42,43 The maximum in the Raman spectrum is 950 cm−1, a relatively low phonon energy, indicating that the CsGd(MoO4)2 material can be a proper host for good UC luminescent materials.

3.2 UC luminescence properties, decay curves and luminescence mechanisms
The UC emission spectra and corresponding intensities of a series of CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ samples under 975 nm laser excitation are presented in Fig. 3. The emission spectra of CsGd0.98−x(MoO4)2:xYb3+,0.02Er3+ (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.30 and 0.40) in Fig. 3a and CsGd0.70−y(MoO4)2:0.30Yb3+,yEr3+ (y = 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04 and 0.06) samples in Fig. 3b show typically two main bands around 528 and 550 nm and a very weak band around 671 nm corresponding to the Er3+ transitions 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2, respectively.44 With increasing Yb3+ concentration x in CsGd0.98−x(MoO4)2:xYb3+,0.02Er3+, the emission intensities for the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions (see Fig. 3c) increase monotonously until x = 0.30, beyond which they start to decrease due to the concentration quenching originating from the general energy back transfer (EBT) from Er3+ to Yb3+: Er3+ (4S3/2) + Yb3+ (2F7/2) → Er3+ (4I13/2) + Yb3+ (2F5/2).45 A similar phenomenon was observed for the CsGd0.70-y(MoO4)2:0.30Yb3+,yEr3+ samples after y = 0.02 (see Fig. 3d) due to the concentration quenching caused by non-radiative energy transfer (ET) and cross relaxation between Er3+ ions.45 It is clearly observed that the Er3+ emission intensity is greatly enhanced after incorporation of Yb3+ as a sensitizer in CsGd0.98(MoO4)2:0.02Er3+ (Fig. 3a and c), as can be seen from the corresponding green emission color and brightness in the inset of Fig. 3a. The Yb3+ ion has a larger absorption cross section around 975 nm and a good energy level match with the Er3+ ions, which allows efficient energy transfer to the Er3+ ions. The CIE chromaticity coordinate diagram for CsGd0.98−x(MoO4)2:xYb3+,0.02Er3+ in Fig. 3a shows that the coordinates vary slightly from (0.257, 0.716) (x = 0.05) to (0.242, 0.732) (x = 0.40), as also listed in Table S2 (ESI†).
 Fig. 3  UC emission spectra of CsGd0.98−x(MoO4)2:xYb3+,0.02Er3+ (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.30 and 0.40) (a), CsGd0.70−y(MoO4)2:0.30Yb3+,yEr3+ (y = 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04 and 0.06) (b) and CsGd0.99−a(MoO4)2:aYb3+,0.01Ho3+ (a = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50) (e) upon 975 nm laser excitation. (c) and (d) are the corresponding variations of the emission intensities for the Er3+ transitions 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 as a function of x and y, and (f) is the corresponding variation of the emission intensities for the Ho3+ transitions 5H4,5S2 and 5F5 → 5I8 as a function of a, respectively; (g) is the variation of the intensity ratio for the 660/550 nm bands. The insets in (a) and (e) show the corresponding luminescence photographs and CIE chromaticity coordinates upon 975 nm laser excitation (power 0.4 W) for CsGd0.98−x(MoO4)2:xYb3+,0.02Er3+ and CsGd0.99−a(MoO4)2:aYb3+,0.01Ho3+ with the Yb3+ concentration increasing from x = 0 to 0.40 and a = 0 to 0.50, respectively. 
As for the CsGd0.99−a(MoO4)2:aYb3+,0.01Ho3+ (a = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50) phosphors, the emission spectra also show two primary bands around 540 and 660 nm together with a very weak one around 755 nm, corresponding to the Ho3+ 5F4,5S2 → 5I8, 5F5 → 5I8 and 5F4,5S2 → 5I7 transitions, respectively. The emission intensities of transitions 5F4,5S2 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5I8 in Fig. 3f increase towards a maximum at a = 0.40 with increasing Yb3+ concentration. The decrease of emission intensity with further increasing Yb3+ concentration may be attributed to a cross relaxation process for an excess of Yb3+ ions. However, the emission intensity ratio between the 660 and 540 nm signals (Fig. 3g) decreases monotonously from 6.669 (x = 0.05) to 3.064 (x = 0.50), which results in a variation of the emission color. This is reflected by a color change from bright light red to light yellow under 975 nm laser excitation for CsGd0.99−a(MoO4)2:aYb3+,0.01Ho3+ with increasing Yb3+ concentration from a = 0.10 to 0.50. This is illustrated in the inset of Fig. 3e, and corresponds to the variation of the CIE chromaticity coordinates for CsGd0.99−a(MoO4)2:aYb3+,0.01Ho3+ from (0.559, 0.429) (a = 0.05) to (0.479, 0.511) (a = 0.50), as also listed in Table S2 (ESI†) and shown in the inset of Fig. 3e, upon increasing Yb3+ concentration. It is also observed that the incorporation of Yb3+ in CsGd0.99(MoO4)2:0.01Ho3+ greatly enhances the UC luminescence of Ho3+ due to efficient energy transfer from Yb3+ to Ho3+ ions.
In order to validate the energy transfer process from Yb3+ to Er3+ in CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ under 975 nm laser excitation, luminescence decay curves monitored at 550 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) in CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+ and 540 nm (5H4,5S2 → 5I8) in CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Ho3+ were collected and are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. As can be observed, all the decay curves for representative CsGd0.98−x(MoO4)2:xYb3+,0.02Er3+ and CsGd0.99−a(MoO4)2:aYb3+,0.01Ho3+ monitored at their respective characteristic emissions could be fitted well with a bi-exponential function as follows:46 I(t) = I0 + A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)(2)in which I and I0 are the luminescence intensity at time t and 0, τ1 and τ2 are the rapid and slow decay components for the fitting lines, and A1 and A2 are constants, respectively. The average decay times for the representative samples could then be calculated using the equation below on the basis of the parameters obtained from the fittings above: τ* = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2)(3)Therefore, the decay time values of the Er3+ emission at 550 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) in CsGd0.98−x(MoO4)2:xYb3+,0.02Er3+ and Ho3+ emission at 540 nm (5H4,5S2 → 5I8) in CsGd0.99−a(MoO4)2:aYb3+,0.01Ho3+ were calculated as 19.20, 49.87, 93.09 and 118.36 μs and 29.42, 54.28, 72.47 and 85.16, respectively, corresponding to Yb3+ concentrations of x = 0, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.40 and a = 0, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.30. As depicted in Fig. 4, both decay profiles for CsGd0.98−x(MoO4)2:xYb3+,0.02Er3+ (Fig. 4a) and CsGd0.99−a(MoO4)2:aYb3+,0.01Ho3+ (Fig. 4b) shift to longer values with increasing sensitizer (Yb3+) concentration. This phenomenon implies that energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+/Ho3+ takes place and plays an important role in the emission generation of Er3+/Ho3+ after the addition of Yb3+ in the Er3+ and Ho3+ singly-doped samples.
 Fig. 4  Decay curves for (a) CsGd0.98−x(MoO4)2:xYb3+,0.02Er3+ (x = 0, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.40) monitored at 550 nm and (b) CsGd0.99−a(MoO4)2:aYb3+,0.01Ho3+ (a = 0, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.30) monitored at 540 nm upon 975 nm laser excitation. 
In general, the UC luminescence mechanism is related to the emission intensity (I) and laser pumping power (P) for any UC process, which can be expressed using the following formula:47 I ∝ Pn(4)in which n is the approximate number of NIR excitation photons absorbed by rare-earth ions in the ground state to transfer to the emitting state at a certain pump-power, which equals the slope of a straight line after fitting the plot of log(I) as a function of pump power log(P). Upon 975 nm excitation, the profiles of CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ do not show any significant change with increasing pump power, while the emission intensities increase monotonously, as presented in Fig. 5a and c, respectively. The values of n for 528 nm green emission (2H11/2 → 4I15/2), 550 nm green emission (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) and 671 nm red emission (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) were fitted to be 2.16, 2.10 and 1.87, respectively, for CsGd0.68(MoO4)2:0.30Yb3+,0.02Er3+, as illustrated in Fig. 5b. Similarly, the value of n equalled 1.89 and 1.85 for 540 nm green (5F4,5F2 → 5I8) and 660 nm (5F5 → 5I8) red emissions from CsGd0.59(MoO4)2:0.40Yb3+,0.01Ho3+, as displayed in Fig. 5d. All these values of n are close to 2, which means the UC luminescence of both green and red emissions in CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ takes place via two-phonon absorption processes.
 Fig. 5  (a) and (c) are the dependences of emission spectra for CsGd0.68(MoO4)2:0.30Yb3+,0.02Er3+ and CsGd0.59(MoO4)2:0.40Yb3+,0.01Ho3+ on increasing pump power, respectively; and (b) and (d) are the corresponding variations of emission intensities for different transitions as a function of pump power (mW). 
Based on the relationship between UC emission intensity and pump power above, an energy level diagram with possible transitions and populating processes of Er3+/Ho3+ and Yb3+ has been depicted in Fig. 6 to better understand the UC luminescence mechanisms under 975 nm excitation. There are several UC processes in CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ including ground state absorption (GSA), excited-state absorption (ESA), energy transfer (ET), cross relaxation (CR) and non-radiative (NR) relaxation. As for CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+, Yb3+ and Er3+ have resonant energy levels at about 10000 cm−1 (corresponding to the absorption of a 975 nm photon), therefore, they absorb the 975 nm NIR photons to realize GSA of Yb3+ 2F7/2 + a photon (975 nm) → 2F5/2 and Er3+ 4I15/2 + a photon (975 nm) → 4I13/2, respectively. However, most of the energy is absorbed by Yb3+ since its absorption cross-section is much larger than that of Er3+; therefore, the population of the 4I13/2 level primarily originates from ET from Yb3+ to Er3+ [ET:Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4I15/2) → Yb3+(2F7/2) + Er3+(4I11/2)].46 In addition, the Er3+ excited state 4I13/2 can also absorb a photon (975 nm) to jump to the 4F7/2 level via additional ESA2 (4I11/2 + a photon → 4F7/2) and ET2 [Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4I11/2) → Yb3+(2F7/2) + Er3+(4F7/2)] processes. Therefore, the green emissions at 528 and 550 nm can be mainly generated via the transitions 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 after the multi-phonon NR processes from the 4F7/2 level to the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels step by step. Red emission at 671 nm is radiated originating from the transition 4F9/2 → 4I15/2, in which the level 4F9/2 can be populated via the possible processes of multi-phonon NR from 4F7/2, ESA1 (4I13/2 + a photon → 4F9/2) and ET1 [Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4I13/2) → Yb3+(2F7/2) + Er3+(4F9/2)] and EBT [Yb3+(2F7/2) + Er3+(4S3/2) → Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4I13/2)]. The CR processes of Er3+(4I15/2) + Er3+(4S3/2) → Er3+(4I9/2) + Er3+(4I13/2) and Er3+(4F9/2) + Er3+(4F9/2) → Er3+(4I11/2) + Er3+(4F7/2) contribute to the population of 4I13/2 and 4F7/2 to generate red and green emission.

In the case of CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Ho3+, it is known that Ho3+ doesn’t have any energy level resonant with 975 nm, therefore, the Ho3+ 5I8 energy level is excited into the 5I6 level via the absorption of Yb3+ [2F7/2 + a photon (975 nm) → 2F5/2] and subsequent ET process [Yb3+(2F5/2) + Ho3+(5I8) → Yb3+(2F7/2) + Er3+(5I6)], in which the extra energy can be dissipated via crystal lattice vibration. The 5I7 level is populated through the NR process from the 5I6 level. Subsequently, with the assistance of ET1 [Yb3+(2F5/2) + Ho3+(5I7) → Yb3+(2F7/2) + Ho3+(5F5)], ET2 [Yb3+(2F5/2) + Ho3+(5I6) → Yb3+(2F7/2) + Er3+(5F4,5S2)] and ESA1 [Ho3+(5I7) + a photon → Ho3+(5F5)] and ESA2 [Ho3+(5I6) + a photon → Ho3+(5F4,5S2)] processes, the energy levels 5F5 and 5F4,5S2 are populated to generate red (660 nm) and green (540 nm) emissions via the transitions from 5F5 and 5F4,5S2 → 5I8, respectively. Moreover, multi-phonon NR from the 5F4,5S2 levels to the 5F5 level also contributes to the red emission (660 nm). Another 755 nm emission can be generated via the 5F4,5S2 → 5I7 transition. However, the transition probability is so low that it can be nearly neglected.
3.3 Down-shifting and possible quantum cutting luminescence properties as well as decay curves
We investigated the down-shifting (DS) and energy transfer [possible down-conversion (DC)] luminescence properties in CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ phosphors. As presented in Fig. 7a, the emission spectra under 376 nm excitation for CsGd0.98−x(MoO4)2:xYb3+,0.02Er3+ (x = 0, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30 and 0.40) look quite similar to those obtained via up-conversion (three main emission peaks at 528, 550 and 671 nm), also showing a monotonous decrease of intensity with increasing Yb3+ concentration x from 0 to 0.40. Monitored at 550 nm, the excitation spectra of CsGd0.98−x(MoO4)2:xYb3+,0.02Er3+ (x = 0 and 0.30) show similar profiles with many sharp peaks at 363, 376, 404, 448 and 488 nm, except for the intensity, corresponding to Er3+ transitions 2K15/2 ← 4I15/2, 4G11/2 ← 4I15/2, (2G,4F,2H)9/2 ← 4I15/2, 4F3/2,4F5/2 ← 4I15/2 and 4F7/2 ← 4I15/2, respectively.48–50 Since the visible Er3+ emission intensity decreases monotonously with increasing Yb3+ concentration in CsGd0.98−x(MoO4)2:xYb3+,0.02Er3+, it is obvious that the addition of Yb3+ in CsGd0.98(MoO4)2:0.02Er3+ has an effect on the luminescence properties of Er3+. Yb3+ has a typical near-infrared luminescence band around 980 nm in many materials upon proper excitation,32,51,52 therefore, it is not uncommon for Er3+ to have an interaction with Yb3+ to influence its luminescence in the near-infrared region. The near-infrared luminescence properties of CsGd1−x−y(MoO4)2:xYb3+,yEr3+ (x = 0, y = 0.02; x = 0.30, y = 0; x = 0.10, 0.20, 0.30 and 0.40, y = 0.02) are shown in Fig. 7b–d. As presented in Fig. 7b, Er3+ shows several characteristic emission bands ranging from 750 to 1300 nm with a dominant one around 995nm (4I11/2 → 4I15/2) upon 376 nm excitation. The excitation spectrum monitored at 995 nm exhibits an identical profile and the same peaks as the one monitored at 550 nm, which illustrates that this emission is Er3+-based. For CsGd0.7(MoO4)2:0.30Yb3+ in Fig. 7c, monitored at the characteristic Yb3+ emission 1006 nm, the excitation spectrum presents an intense broad band around 308 nm corresponding to the Yb3+–O2− CT transition often encountered in Yb3+-doped materials.53,54 The emission spectrum (λex = 308 nm) shows the characteristic Yb3+ emission band around 1006 nm attributed to the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 Yb3+ transition. The energy-transfer process will be discussed later in Fig. 9b. For the CsGd1−x−y(MoO4)2:xYb3+,yEr3+ (x = 0.30, y = 0; x = 0.10, 0.20, 0.30 and 0.40) phosphors, the emission spectra shown in Fig. 7d mainly contain profiles from Yb3+ upon 376 nm excitation. By comparing the emission profiles and peaks with those in Fig. 7b and c, it is clear that energy transfer from Er3+ to Yb3+ ions took place in these phosphors. The emission intensity increases with increasing Yb3+ concentration until x = 0.30, beyond which it starts to decrease due to the concentration quenching effect. The excitation spectrum monitored at 1006 nm for CsGd0.68(MoO4)2:0.30Yb3+,0.02Er3+ shows both Yb3+ and Er3+ excitation bands along with the Yb3+–O2− CT transition, which further confirms the energy transfer from Er3+ to Yb3+ ions. Moreover, the decay curves (λem = 550 nm, λex = 376 nm) for the CsGd0.98−x(MoO4)2:xYb3+,0.02Er3+ (x = 0, 0.10 and 0.30) samples depicted in Fig. 7e can be fitted well with a single-exponential function and the calculated luminescence decay times are 20.85, 16.63 and 13.19 μs, respectively. The decrease of the lifetime values further supports the energy transfer from Er3+ to Yb3+ ions in these phosphors. The possible energy transfer mechanisms from Er3+ to Yb3+ will be discussed in Fig. 9a.

(e) Decay curves (λem = 550 nm, λex = 376 nm) for CsGd0.98−x(MoO4)2:xYb3+,0.02Er3+ (x = 0, 0.10 and 0.30) samples. 
Similarly, the PL excitation (λem = 540 nm) and emission (λex = 449 nm) spectra of CsGd0.99−a(MoO4)2:aYb3+,0.01Ho3+ (a = 0, 0.05, 0.20 and 0.40) are shown in Fig. 8a. The emission spectra upon 449 nm excitation show dominant bands around 540 nm (5F4,5S2 → 5I8) together with two other bands around 660 (5F5 → 5I8) and 752 nm (5F4,5S2 → 5I7). It is obvious that the emission intensity decreases monotonously with increasing Yb3+ concentration in CsGd0.99−a(MoO4)2:aYb3+,0.01Ho3+ (a = 0, 0.05, 0.20 and 0.40). The excitation spectra of CsGd0.99−a(MoO4)2:aYb3+,0.01Ho3+ (a = 0 and 0.05) monitored at 540 nm exhibit similar profiles with several peaks at 358, 415, 449 and 489 nm, corresponding to the Ho3+ transitions 3H6,(5G,3H)5 ← 5I8, (5G,3G)5 ← 5I8, 5G6 ← 5I8 and 5F3 ← 5I8, respectively.50,55,56 The emission spectrum of CsGd0.99(MoO4)2:0.01Ho3+ (Fig. 8b) shows a dominant band around 1185 nm (5I6 → 5I8) together with several characteristic bands in the range of 900–1300 nm. The excitation spectrum monitored at 1185 nm has a similar profile and comparable peaks to the one monitored at 540 nm, indicating that the emission band around 1185 nm belongs to Ho3+. Fig. 8c shows the excitation and emission spectra of CsGd0.70(MoO4)2:0.30Yb3+, which had already been depicted above in Fig. 7c. In Fig. 8d, the emission spectra of CsGd0.99−a(MoO4)2:aYb3+, 0.01Ho3+ (a = 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30 and 0.40) both show the Yb3+ band at 1006 nm and the Ho3+ band at 1185 nm under 449 nm excitation. Moreover, the emission intensity of the former one seems to increase until a = 0.30, beyond which the intensity begins to decrease, attributed to the concentration quenching, while the latter one is nearly unchanged. This is illustrated by the ET2 process in Fig. 9a. Monitored at 1006 nm, the excitation spectrum of CsGd0.69(MoO4)2:0.30Yb3+,0.01Ho3+ displays both Yb3+ and Ho3+ excitation bands together with the Yb3+–O2− CT transition, which also points to the occurrence of energy transfer from Ho3+ to Yb3+ ions in these CsGd (MoO4)2:Yb3+,Ho3+ materials. Moreover, the decay curves (λem = 540 nm, λex = 449 nm) for the CsGd0.99−a(MoO4)2:aYb3+,0.01Ho3+ (a = 0, 0.20 and 0.40) samples can be fitted well with a bi-exponential function and the calculated lifetimes from these fits are 6.66, 4.66 and 2.47 μs, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8e. The decrease of the emission lifetime and the emission intensity of Ho3+ with increasing Yb3+ concentration in these CsGd0.99−a(MoO4)2:aYb3+,0.01Ho3+ (a = 0, 0.05, 0.20 and 0.40) samples further illustrates the energy transfer (possible down-conversion) from Ho3+ to Yb3+ ions.

 Fig. 9  Possible energy transfer mechanisms from Er3+ and Ho3+ to Yb3+ ions (a) and a configurational diagram for the Yb3+–O2− charge transfer transition (b) in CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ materials. (QC: down-conversion, ET: energy transfer, NR: non-radiative relaxation, BET: back energy transfer, CT: charge transfer). 
Based on the spectral analysis above, possible energy transfer mechanisms from Er3+ and Ho3+ to Yb3+ ions as well as the Yb3+–O2− CT transition process are proposed in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 9a, Er3+ and Ho3+ produce their characteristic visible and near-infrared emissions after non-radiative relaxation (NR) by absorbing at 376 and 449 nm in the singly-doped samples, respectively. When Yb3+ and Er3+ ions are co-doped into the same host, one photon at the Er3+ level 4F7/2 will produce two photons via the successive Er3+ transitions 4F7/2 → 4I11/2 and 4I11/2 → 4I15/2, in which the energy matches with the Yb3+ absorption from 2F5/2 ← 2F7/2, resulting in the occurrence of energy transfer from Er3+ to Yb3+ to realize the Yb3+ characteristic emission band at 1006 nm. Therefore, the number of electrons at level 2H11/2 is reduced via the non-radiative relaxation from level 4F7/2, which results in the decrease of emission intensity in the visible region as shown in Fig. 7a. As for Yb3+ and Ho3+ co-doped CsGd(MoO4)2, considering the energy level matching between these two ions, there may be two mechanisms leading to the near-infrared emission of Yb3+.57 One possible way is a cooperative DC mechanism from the Er3+ transition 5F3 → 5I8 since the energy of this transition is approximately twice the energy of the Yb3+ transition 2F5/2 ← 2F7/2. However, it seems not to be responsible for that because the emission of this transition can not be observed. The other mechanism implies electrons at the Ho3+ level 5G6 relaxing to the 5F4,5S2 levels to generate the transition 5F4,5S2 → 5I6 or 5F5 followed by 5F5 → 5I7. Subsequently, energy transfer to the Yb3+ ions will occur, which corresponds to a cross-relaxation (CR) process. Moreover, the back energy transfer (BET) process: Ho3+(5I8) + Yb3+(2F5/2) → Ho3+(5I6) + Yb3+(2F7/2),58 which can enhance the near-infrared emission intensity of Ho3+, could also contribute to this possible quantum cutting process. Nevertheless, it can be observed that the emission intensity at 1185 nm (5I6 → 5I8) in Fig. 8c is almost unchanged with increasing Yb3+ concentration, which illustrates the existence of this process in the materials. As depicted in Fig. 9b, Yb3+ is excited to its CT state by absorbing a 308 nm UV photon, and as the energy of the CT state overlaps with the Yb3+ energy level 2F5/2, this results in non-radiative relaxation from the Yb3+–O2− state to the Yb3+ excited state 2F5/2, populating the latter, followed by the Yb3+ transition 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 producing the near-infrared emission at 1006 nm. Therefore, it can be concluded that UV or blue light can be efficiently converted into near-infrared emission to elevate the solar spectral conversion efficiency in this kind of phosphors. Since the c-Si solar cells show their maximum spectral response around 1000 nm, this is a property which is rarely discovered and investigated in Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ doped molybdate phosphors.
The energy transfer (ET) (possible down-conversion) efficiency can be approximately estimated using the method of intensity variation at Er3+ 550 nm or Ho3+ 540 nm.58 The emission intensities at 550 nm (Er3+ 4S3/2 → 4I15/2) and 540 nm (Ho3+ 5F4,5S2 → 5I8) in the current CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ materials with different Yb3+ concentrations can be expressed as follows:58 I = khvw(1 − ηET)N(5)where k is a constant for a certain detection system, h is the Planck constant, ν is the frequency of the 550 nm Er3+ emission or the 540 nm Ho3+ emission, w is the radiative rate of the Er3+ level 4S3/2 or the Ho3+ levels 5F4,5S2, N refers to the number of Er3+ ions at the excited level 4S3/2 or Ho3+ ions at the excited levels 5F4, 5S2, and ηET is defined as the energy transfer efficiency. Therefore, the emission intensity ratio R at 550 nm for Er3+ or 540 nm for Ho3+ in Yb3+, Er3+/Ho3+ co-doped (I) and Er3+/Ho3+ singly doped (I0) samples can be expressed as below: R = I/I0 = khvw(1 − ηET)N/khvwN(6)When the measurement conditions are fixed, ηET can be expressed as follows, according to the equation above: ηET = 1 − I/I0(7)in which I and I0 represent the emission intensity at 550 nm for Er3+ or 540 nm for Ho3+ with and without Yb3+ co-doping in Yb3+, Er3+/Ho3+ doped CsGd(MoO4)2, respectively. Thus, ηET is calculated to be 55.5%, 69.3%, 80.7%, and 87.1% corresponding to Yb3+ concentrations x = 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, and 0.40 in CsGd0.98−x(MoO4)2:xYb3+,0.02Er3+ and 28.6%, 58.6%, and 80.7% corresponding to a = 0.05, 0.20, and 0.40 in CsGd0.99−x(MoO4)2:aYb3+,0.01Ho3+, respectively. These increasing ηET values illustrate that the energy transfer processes from Er3+ or Ho3+ to Yb3+ ions become more and more efficient with increasing Yb3+ concentration.
4. Conclusions
In this work, we synthesized a series of CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ phosphors using a high-temperature solid-state reaction method. We investigated the up-conversion luminescence properties of the as-prepared samples upon 975 nm excitation. The Er3+ emission spectra showed dominant emission peaks at 528 and 550 nm corresponding to the Er3+ transitions 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, respectively, as well as a weak emission peak originating from the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition at 671 nm, in CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+. The CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Ho3+ samples mainly displayed two emission peaks at 540 and 660 nm together with a negligible one at 755 nm, corresponding to the Ho3+ transitions 4F4,5F2 → 5I8, 5F5 → 5I8 and 4F4,5F2 → 5I7, respectively. The emission color was tuned from orange red to light yellow due to the large energy gap between 4F4,5F2 and 5F5 with increasing Yb3+ concentration in the CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Ho3+ samples. Moreover, we could observe down-shifting luminescence upon exciting Er3+ at 376 nm and Ho3+ at 449 nm. Interestingly, we found efficient energy transfer (possible quantum cutting) from Er3+/Ho3+ to Yb3+ and an intense Yb3+–O2− CT transition in molybdate for the first time, which was deduced from visible and near-infrared emission spectra of Yb3+, Er3+/Ho3+ co-doped samples and from the decrease of the Er3+/Ho3+ luminescence lifetimes with increasing Yb3+ concentration in the CsGd(MoO4)2:Yb3+,Er3+/Ho3+ samples. These results suggest their potential application in solid-state lighting and displays as well as in solar energy conversion systems.
