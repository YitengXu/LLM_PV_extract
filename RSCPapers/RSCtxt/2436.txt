    , Accepted 27th April 2014First published on 30th April 2014AbstractIn a dual bandgap system such as WO3/BiVO4, the morphology of each component should be controlled by understanding its properties, in particular with respect to the charge flow in the system. For WO3/BiVO4 photoanodes, a porous BiVO4 film allows contact of an electrolyte to the bottom layer with enhanced surface area, thereby promoting the oxidation reaction, while one-dimensional (1-D) WO3 nanorods, directly grown on F-doped tin oxide, are advantageous for transporting electrons to the back contact. The morphology of the BiVO4 film covered by 1-D WO3 nanorods varies with the addition of organic additives such as ethylcellulose in the metal precursor solution. The cross-sectional images from scanning electron microscopy show that 1-D WO3 nanorods is coated with the BiVO4 layer, which forms a porous top layer that can effectively absorb visible light and enhance charge transfer resulting in enhanced photocurrents. We report on the highest photocurrent at a potential of 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by means of a 1-D WO3/BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode. The strategies for constructing such kind of heterojunctions are well applicable to other dual bandgap photoanodes.
Introduction
Direct energy conversion from sunlight to chemicals is one of the most promising renewable energy resources to account for a globally increasing energy consumption.1 It can offer a route to utilize and store the tremendous amount of solar energy in usable fuels. Among various thermodynamic uphill reactions, researches on water splitting, which stores the solar energy in the simplest chemical bond of H2, have advanced considerably over recent years.2–5 To accomplish photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting, the development of an applicable semiconductor material is of key importance because it must satisfy several strict requirements, such as suitable band-edge potentials, efficient visible light absorption, chemical stability, non-toxicity, and low cost.6,7
Many metal-oxide semiconductors, such as TiO2, WO3, and Fe2O3 have been widely examined for the use as photoanode materials due to their excellent stability. Although a recent progress with a metal nitride photoanode reported the highest ever reported photocurrents for water splitting (6.7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, Ba-doped Ta3N5),8 metal nitride (or sulfide) materials are typically vulnerable to decompose due to oxidation or dissolution in oxygen-rich aqueous environment.9 Although many oxides are stable for PEC water splitting, they are still suffering from low efficiencies. Some of these materials have a too large band gap to absorb visible light,6 whereas others have unacceptable band positions for spontaneous water splitting.10–12 The valence band (VB) position of the metal oxide is typically too low (∼3.0 V vs. RHE) because the VB is mainly composed of O 2p and the conduction band (CB) mainly originates from the metal's valence orbitals.13 Therefore, a trial to decrease the band gap of metal oxides consequently gives an insufficient CB position for spontaneous hydrogen reduction. However, BiVO4 maintains its CB position close to the hydrogen-reduction potential, even with a direct band gap magnitude of Eg = 2.4 eV, which makes it a very promising candidate material.14 This unique band position occurs because Bi 6s are located above the O 2p energy level, thus contributing to a higher VB-edge position at ∼2.4 V (vs. RHE).
Although BiVO4 has attractive band positions with suitable bandgap energy, early studies were not successful because of the poor electron–hole separation, inefficient charge-transport properties, and slow water-oxidation kinetics.15 To solve these problems, several strategies have been applied. For instance, morphology control,16 doping with transition metals,17 composite structures with other semiconductors,18,19 and introduction of oxygen-evolution catalysts (OECs)20,21 have led to significant progress.
Especially, the dual bandgap composite system with WO3 is a fascinating combination22,23 because of counterbalancing the shortages of each individual component. The smaller band gap of BiVO4 can match better with the solar visible spectrum, and its high CB energy level can transfer the photo-excited electrons to the CB of WO3 which, in turn, can improve the charge-separation efficiency. WO3 shows better electron-transport properties than BiVO4 which can increase the charge-collection efficiency. Holes in the VB of WO3 can thermodynamically move to the VB of BiVO4 and, thereby, lead to proceeded oxidation of water at the surface of BiVO4. Because the roles of the different components are variable, different approaches should be adopted to control the morphology of each individual component. For example, nanoparticles or porous structures are favorable for the BiVO4 layer since they can decrease the travel distance of charges and, thereby, improve the charge-separation efficiency.24 Simultaneously, the increased surface area is advantageous to promote the water-oxidation reaction. On the other hand, one-dimensional (1-D) nanostructures of WO3 are desirable because of the excellent charge transport along the 1-D structures, and the short travel distance across the diameter can help charge separation at heterojunction interfaces.25,26 However, most of the previous WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions have been fabricated in the form of simple bilayers, in which a BiVO4 thin film was coated on top of a WO3 thin film.18,23 Alternatively, nanostructured geometries were investigated to focus on the increasing interfacial area between WO3 and BiVO4, but charge transport property though WO3 layer can be sacrificed.22 Only few studies reported on 1-D WO3 nanostructures in conjunction with BiVO4 films,27–29 but they failed to show a marked improvement compared to simple bilayers27,28 until 1-D WO3 was obtained with desirable crystal structures.29
Here, we demonstrate that the control of the morphology of each individual layer in WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions is critical to optimize the photocurrent. The morphology should be designed on the basis of understanding the functions of the each layer. 1-D WO3 nanorod arrays were directly grown on F-doped tin oxide (FTO) by a single-step hydrothermal synthesis without using ex situ seed layers, unlike, for example, doctor blading.10,30 These nanorods have a monoclinic crystal structure known to have better charge transport than their hexagonal counterparts.26,28 In addition, an organic binder, such as ethylcellulose (EC), was added to the BiVO4 precursor solution to increase the adhesion and porosity of the BiVO4 film on top of the 1-D WO3 nanorod arrays that resulted in a large improvement in the photocurrent by more than a factor of three. Especially, the improvement was most pronounced at low bias potentials (<1.23 V vs. RHE). A further improvement of the photocurrent was achieved by decorating the surface of the porous BiVO4 film with cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi), acting as OEC. We attained the high photocurrent using a WO3/BiVO4 photoanode that is also higher than the photocurrent with metal-oxides, the recently reported champion Fe2O3 photoanode31 or gradient W:BiVO4 electrode on FTO glass32 (at a bias potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE). The measurement of the external quantum efficiency of the WO3/BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode showed that the visible light absorbed by the BiVO4 layer was effectively utilized for water splitting with the assistance of the WO3 layer which has good electron-transport properties.
Experimental
Preparation of WO3 nanorod arrays
WO3 nanorod arrays were directly grown on an FTO substrate (TEC 8, Pilkington) by a hydrothermal method reported previously.26 1 g of ammonium paratungstate ((NH4)10W12O41·5H2O) (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%) dissolved in distilled water (93 mL) was vigorously stirred for 1 h until the solution became clear. After addition of HCl (2 mL; Sigma Aldrich, 37.5%), the solution was further stirred for 45 min before H2O2 (4 mL; Junsei, 30%) was added. This transparent tungsten-precursor solution was transferred to a Teflon liner (100 mL capacity), in which a pre-cleaned FTO substrate was dipped with the conductive side facing down. The autoclave was moved into an oven kept at 160 °C for 4 h of reaction time and, subsequently, was slowly cooled down to room temperature. The as-prepared orthorhombic WO3·0.33 H2O nanorod arrays were annealed at 500 °C for 2 h to obtain the monoclinic form of WO3.
BiVO4 layer coating
BiVO4 was coated on WO3 nanorods grown on the FTO substrate or directly on bare an FTO substrate by spin coating of a metal precursor solution to which organic additives that act as binder were added to control the porous nature of the BiVO4 layer. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without extra purification. Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.173 g) and vanadyl acetylacetonate (0.095 g) were dissolved in 5 mL of a solution of acetic acid : acetylacetone = 1:7.33 (volume ratio), and ethylcellulose (EC; 0.025–0.3 g mL−1) or polyvinyl acetate (PVAc; 0.1 g mL−1) was added as organic binder. The morphology of the resulting BiVO4 layer was compared with the alternatively prepared heterojunction using precursor solution without binder. A two-step spin coating at 500 rpm for 60 s and at 2000 rpm for 30 s was applied to promote penetration of the precursor solution into the WO3 nanorod arrays. The spin-coated film was heat treated on a hot plate at 500 °C for 10 min. The spin coating and heat treatment were repeated and the final film was annealed at 500 °C for 8 h.
Co-Pi deposition
Co-Pi was deposited on a WO3/BiVO4 photoanode by electro-deposition employing a three-electrode system.20 The electrolytic bath was 0.5 mM CoCl2·6H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 98%) in 0.1 M pH 7 potassium phosphate buffer, and a potential of 0.95 V vs. a Ag/AgCl reference electrode was applied for 3, 5, and 7 min.
Photo-electrochemical performance measurements
The photocurrents were measured in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (in case of the bare WO3 photoanode only) or in a diluted solution of 0.5 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M pH 7 potassium phosphate buffer solution (for all other heterojunctions) by linear-sweep voltammetry (Iviumstatpotentiostat, Ivium technology) using a three-electrode configuration under AM-1.5G illumination conditions (simulated sunlight, 100 mW cm−2). The applied potential was converted to the value against a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by using the eqn (1) below. (1)
A solar simulator (ABET, Sun 2000) equipped with a 300 W Xe lamp and air mass (AM) 1.5 filter was used to generate simulated solar light. A counter electrode of platinum (Pt) and a reference electrode of Ag/AgCl were used for the three-electrode configuration.
The IPCE was measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE, but the light source in this case was a 1000 W xenon lamp (Newport). The light passed through a liquid IR filter and a motorized monochromator (Newport, Cornerstone 130). The photocurrent under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight was compared with the integrated current using the measured IPCE values and ASTM G173-03 reference spectra, confirming consistency at a level of 95–100%.
On the other hand, the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency was measured in a two-electrode configuration without any reference electrodes. The products of the PEC reaction were accumulated in a closed single body quartz PEC cell in which both of the anode and the Pt cathode were dipped without separation of each electrode, and the accumulated products were characterized by gas chromatography (Youglin 6500 GC) equipped with a thermal conductive detector (TCD) using ultra high purity (UHP) Ar (99.9999%) as a carrier gas to quantify hydrogen and oxygen. The GC was directly connected to the PEC cell, and the gaseous sample was injected by a six-port valve. The photoanode was illuminated through the quartz window of the PEC cell, and its photocurrent was measured under the simulated sunlight to measure the faradaic efficiencies.
Characterization
The top-view and cross-sectional surface morphologies of WO3, WO3/BiVO4, and Co-Pi deposited WO3/BiVO4 were investigated by SEM (Hitachi, S-4100, and FEI, Inspect F50). Crystal structures and absorbance were characterized by X-ray diffraction (Shimadzu X) and UV-Vis spectrometry (Varian, Cary 100), respectively.
Results and discussion
BiVO4 coating with organic additives
Dramatic morphology changes of the BiVO4 layer coated on top of WO3 nanorod arrays were observed in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 1) in dependence of the used organic binders. If BiVO4 metal-precursor solution was prepared without organic additives, the resulting WO3/BiVO4 film was not much different from the WO3 nanorod arrays, as evidenced by the corresponding SEM images (Fig. 1a and b), although the color of the film changed to yellow, indicative of a thin layer of deposited BiVO4. However, if polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) or EC was included in the precursor solution, non-conformal coating of BiVO4 started to fill the voids between the WO3 nanorods. A less dense filling with higher porosity was observed on EC addition (Fig. 1e and f) as compared to PVAc addition (Fig. 1c and d), even at the same concentration of 0.1 g mL−1. The addition of the organic binder fulfills two functions. It increases the viscosity of the precursor solution, which can help on the effective deposition of a relatively thick layer with good adhesion and, at the same time, it forms pores in the deposited film at positions where the organic binders are removed during the subsequent calcination step.33,34 Therefore, as the concentration of EC increased from 0.025, 0.05, 0.1 to 0.3 g mL−1, the BiVO4 coating on top of the WO3 nanorod arrays became less uniform but thicker. The surface of the WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction became rounded (Fig. 1f), and uniform deposition was obtained over a large area up to 0.1 g mL−1 of EC addition (Fig. 1e). When the concentration of EC was diluted to 0.05 g mL−1 (Fig. 1g), a smaller amount of BiVO4 was coated and, thereby, the nanorods maintained their shape, as evident from top-view SEM image. Meanwhile, partial detachment of the BiVO4 porous film was observed in case of a high EC binder concentration (0.3 g mL−1) (Fig. 1h).
 Fig. 1  SEM images of 1-D WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction films on FTO substrate. The morphology depends on the precursor solutions used for BiVO4, which was spin-coated three times. The films were prepared by using a precursor solution without organic binder (a and b), with 0.1 g mL−1 of PVAc (c and d), 0.1 g mL−1 of EC (e and f), 0.05 g mL−1 of EC (g), and 0.3 g mL−1 of EC (h). 
The photocurrent of the pure WO3-nanorod photoanode amounted to 0.55 mA cm−2 (at 2.0 V vs. RHE) and could be improved to 1.5–2.4 mA cm−2 after BiVO4 coating (spin coating, repeated three times). The improvement depended on the type and concentration of the organic additives, showing the highest photocurrent in the case of adding 0.1 g mL−1 of EC (Fig. 2a). Because the band gap of BiVO4 is smaller (2.4 eV) than that of WO3 (2.6 eV),26 the coated BiVO4 can absorb light at longer wavelengths, thereby resulting in higher photocurrents than is commonly found, regardless of the use of organic binders.

Moreover, the magnitude of the photocurrent enhancement is associated with the morphology changes induced by the different sample preparation conditions (Fig. 2). Among all investigated WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions, the photocurrent was improved by a factor of 3.2 (at 1.23 V vs. RHE) when EC at a concentration of 0.1 g mL−1 was added to the precursor solution (0.48 mA cm−2 for WO3/BiVO4 without binder and 1.55 mA cm−2 for WO3/BiVO4 with EC). When the bias potential was lower than 1.5 V vs. RHE, WO3/BiVO4 without binder showed the lowest enhancement probably due to a too small amount of deposited BiVO4, according to the SEM images. However, its photocurrent level became similar or even slightly higher than that of WO3/BiVO4 with PVAc (WO3/BiVO4 (PVAc)) under higher bias voltages (∼1.5 mA cm−2), indicating that the amount of BiVO4 is not the only factor that determines the photocurrent density. One of the important factors that can influence the photoactivity is the charge-separation efficiency of photoexcited holes and electrons. Poor charge mobility related to a short hole-diffusion length within the BiVO4 layer has been considered to cause recombination losses, which can be reduced by decreasing the particle size (corresponding to an increase of the surface-to-volume ratio), similarly to the case of hematite Fe2O3. Therefore, the porous nature of the BiVO4 film obtained in WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions prepared using EC (WO3/BiVO4 (EC)) is expected to induce efficient charge separation by giving a high surface area that is in contact with the electrolyte, consistent with the observation of the high photocurrent under all bias potentials. The decreased charge transfer resistance between the photoanode/electrolyte was observed by an electrochemical impedance measurement (see Fig. S1†), when BiVO4 layer was spin-coated using EC binder.
We also found that 0.1 g mL−1 was the optimum concentration of EC additive in the investigated range of 0–0.3 g mL−1 on the basis of the measured photocurrents of WO3/BiVO4 (EC) photoanodes in which BiVO4 was spin-coated only once (Fig. 2b). Higher concentrations of EC are expected to be favorable to generate pores in the film, but a too high concentration causes non-uniform coating and detachment of the film due to a too high viscosity (Fig. 1h). Hereafter, all BiVO4 coatings were performed using the precursor solution containing 0.1 g mL−1 of EC and the spin coating was repeated three times, unless otherwise noted.
Porous BiVO4 layer on WO3 nanorod arrays
The top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of WO3/BiVO4 (EC) photoanodes revealed the evolution of a porous BiVO4 film on top of the 1-D WO3 nanorod arrays as spin coating was repeated (Fig. 3). Fig. 3a and b show films of bare WO3 nanorod arrays on FTO substrate with an average length of 1.6 μm. When the precursor solution was spin-coated once, the BiVO4 film covered the core WO3 nanorod arrays in a typical core–shell configuration (Fig. 3c and d). However, when the spin coating was repeated three times, the top BiVO4 porous film covered the bottom WO3/BiVO4 core–shell arrays and voids were observed between them (Fig. 3e–g). The thickness of the top BiVO4 layer did not increase a lot, and the morphology was similar to the WO3/BiVO4 (EC) anode, although the spin coating was followed by a heat treatment for 10 min at 500 °C that was repeated up to 10 times (not shown here). It was difficult to detect 1-D geometries on the basis of the top-view SEM images of the electrodes that were spin coated three times (Fig. 3e) and only porous film surfaces were observed. We expect that the top porous BiVO4 film allows penetration and direct contact of the electrolyte to the bottom WO3/BiVO4 layer. The morphologies of the WO3/BiVO4 (EC) photoanode has been maintained even after Co-Pi deposition, and small protrusions of Co-Pi over the BiVO4 film could be observed (Fig. 3h). X-ray diffraction patterns of the electrodes confirmed that this preparation method gave monoclinic BiVO4 coatings over monoclinic WO3 structures, grown on the FTO substrate (Fig. 4).

Here, the BiVO4 precursor solution contained 0.1 g mL−1 of EC.

PEC performances of WO3/BiVO4 photoanodes
The combination of WO3 and BiVO4 shows a large enhancement of the photocurrent in comparison to the individual photoanodes, i.e. porous BiVO4 thin films and WO3 nanorod arrays (Fig. 5a). The photocurrent of the BiVO4 photoanode showed a value of only 0.016 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, although it was prepared by the same method, (three times spin coating) on FTO substrate, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 8 h. In comparison, the photocurrent of the WO3 nanorod photoanode achieved 0.72 mA cm−2 (±0.1 mA cm−2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE by optimizing the hydrothermal growth conditions. It turned out that the preparation of the tungsten precursor solution strongly affected the photocurrents of the WO3 nanorod photoanodes with the same average length of 1.6 μm s. Concerning WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions, the photocurrents of WO3/BiVO4 improved as the number of spin coatings increased from one to three, but not beyond, because the amount of BiVO4 increased, consistent with the SEM images. The photocurrent was enhanced up to 2.7 mA cm−2 (at 1.23 V vs. RHE) and 3.8 mA cm−2 (at 2.0 V vs. RHE) after three times of BiVO4 coating. By using EC, we could obtain such a high photocurrent after only three times of spin coating which represents a significant advantage because, usually, spin coating has to be applied much more repeatedly without organic binder. In terms of the onset potential of the photocurrent, the values were similar at about 0.4–0.5 V vs. RHE for the WO3 and WO3/BiVO4 photoanodes, but the BiVO4 photoanode had a lower potential (0.15 V vs. RHE), consistent with its higher CB position.15
 Fig. 5  (a) Photocurrent densities of WO3, BiVO4, and WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanodes, and (b) photocurrent densities of WO4/BiVO4 for various Co-Pi deposition times (0, 3, 5, and 7 min). 
Compared to the photocurrent displayed in Fig. 2a, it is interesting that the growth condition of WO3 influenced significantly the final photocurrents of the WO3/BiVO4 photoanodes, thereby emphasizing the importance of the morphology of the WO3 nanostructures. This can be understood by looking at the charge flow within the WO3/BiVO4 heterojunction. When BiVO4 is combined with an electron-transport layer like WO3, charge separation is driven efficiently by the difference of the electronic band positions of the two materials. Holes move from WO3 to BiVO4 due to the lower VB potential of WO3, and electrons move from BiVO4 to WO3 due to the higher CB potential of BiVO4. To complete the charge flow at the photoanode side, the holes must be transferred to the electrolyte to oxidize water, and the electrons must be transferred to the back-side contact (FTO) across the WO3 nanorod arrays. To obtain the maximum photocurrent, the electron transport along the WO3 structures and across the WO3/FTO junction must be efficient enough not to be the rate determining step. A previous report suggested26 that direct growth of WO3 on the FTO substrate is possible by means of a one-step hydrothermal synthesis as an in situ seed layer was formed, followed by nanorod growth. 1-D nanostructures of WO3, as well as good chemical adhesion to FTO can contribute to enhanced photocurrents of the heterojunction by improving the charge-collection efficiency.
The photocurrent, measured under AM-1.5G light, was further enhanced by Co-Pi decoration on the surface of the WO3/BiVO4 photoanode and reached up to 3.3 mA cm−2 (at 1.23 V vs. RHE) (Fig. 5b). This value represents the highest photocurrent ever achieved for the WO3/BiVO4 system. Photogenerated holes reaching the BiVO4 surface are involved in water oxidation, but the slow water-oxidation kinetics is known to be a major obstacle for BiVO4 to achieve a high photocurrent. To overcome this problem, OEC materials, such as FeOOH21 and Co-Pi,20 are deposited on the BiVO4 photoanode surface. Fig. 5b shows that the increased photocurrent correlates with the increased electrodeposition time of Co-Pi, and the highest value was achieved for a deposition time of 7 min. Exceeding 7 min, the photocurrent decreased because of light screening by Co-Pi. The photocurrent enhancement caused by Co-Pi deposition dominated near the onset potential of the photocurrent at which the reduced band bending is inferior to the hole transfer across the interface from BiVO4 to the electrolyte, and relatively low incremental photocurrents are achieved under high bias potentials. Moreover, the onset potential of the photocurrent was shifted to 0.3 V vs. RHE after Co-Pi decoration by reducing the over-potential for water oxidation. In contrast, BiVO4 coating on top of WO3 caused a most pronounced photocurrent enhancement at high bias potentials because the enhancement originates from a different reason, i.e. increased light absorbance due to the smaller band gap of BiVO4. These results suggest that there is room to achieve a photocurrent close to 3.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE by optimizing the OECs. However, to accomplish photocurrents of more than 4 mA cm−2, further development in the synthesis of WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions is required, such as replacing WO3 or BiVO4 by doped materials.
The combination of heterojunction and electrocatalyst (Co-Pi) resulted in the highest photocurrent of the BiVO4 system, namely 3.3 mA cm−2, which is comparable to the reported photoanodic water-splitting employing other metal oxides. At 1.23 V vs. RHE, our best photoanode exhibited an even higher photocurrent than that of the champion photoanode (2.1 mA cm−2, Fe2O3) reported by Grätzel et al.,31 and of the doped gradient W:BiVO4 (3 mA cm−2) reported later by Roel van de Krol et al.,32 the highest photocurrent hitherto existing for BiVO4 on FTO although our value is lower than that (3.6 mA cm−2) with W:BiVO4 on a specially textured transparent conducting oxide (TCO) film. A more detailed comparison with metal oxides is given in the supporting information (Table S1†) including the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE).
Our WO3/BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode also has one of the highest IPCE values achieved, reaching 50–65% in the wavelength region of 300–470 nm (Fig. 6a). The integrated photocurrents vs. wavelength reveal that the currents of bare WO3 and WO3/BiVO4 are of similar magnitude at wavelengths of the incident light of less than 350 nm. However, the difference in the currents sharply increases in the spectral region of λ = 350–520 nm in which most of the light is absorbed by BiVO4. The onset of the IPCE for WO3/BiVO4 was at 530 nm, well agreed with the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the synthesized WO3/BiVO4 (Fig. 6b), in good agreement with the reported bandgap value of BiVO4.15 In addition, the IPCE measurements showed an identical maximum value of 65% for the WO3/BiVO4 and the bare WO3 nanorod photoanode, indicating that electron transport across the WO3 layer is critical in determining the quantum yield of WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions. These results determine the future research direction, that further development of the WO3 preparation method or replacement of the electron transporting material is necessary to achieve further improvements of the photocurrent with BiVO4. Possible approaches include improving the quality of the WO3 seed layer on the FTO substrate, increasing the charge-transport properties of WO3 by doping, or adding conductive materials, such as reduced graphene oxide.

Previous studies on dual bandgap systems such as WO3/BiVO4 heterojunctions have been focused on bilayer geometries due to the easiness of their synthesis.18,22,23 Synergistic effects of dual bandgap system on the photocurrent are expected for small bandgap materials such as BiVO4, which absorb in the spectral region of visible light, while the other component, i.e. WO3, enables efficient electron transport. However, in simple bilayer film devices, charges have to pass through a badly conducting layer, the BiVO4 film, which must have a minimum thickness to absorb visible light efficiently. Porous nanoparticles or a rough layer of WO3 have been demonstrated to increase the interface area between WO3 and BiVO4. The increased junction area is advantageous for charge separation by reducing the charge-transport distance in the BiVO4 layer, but inferior electron transport in discontinuous WO3 structures can increase the recombination loss within the WO3 film while electrons move toward the back contact. Therefore, we believe that the combination of 1-D structures of WO3 and porous nanostructures for the upper BiVO4 layer is an ideal geometry by satisfying both kinds of favorable properties, a high junction area and good electron transfer. Su et al.28 suggested that core/shell WO3/BiVO4 nanostructures were better than planar bilayer films for the use as photoanodes, but their photocurrents were only ∼1.0 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, probably because of the undesirable hexagonal WO3 crystal structure and imperfect BiVO4 coating. On the contrary, the present hydrothermal preparation allows the growth of monoclinic WO3 nanorod arrays on FTO that have a higher photocurrent26 and, moreover, are expected to have shorter electron-transit times than hexagonal WO3.28,35 In addition, the control of the porosity of the BiVO4-film coating on top of the 1-D WO3 structures contributes to the photocurrent enhancement compared to a simple core–shell heterojunction.29
Two-electrode measurements of the WO3/BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode
Last but not least, the PEC performance of a WO3/BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode was measured by means of a two-electrode configuration using a Pt counter electrode to obtain the actual solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (ηSTH) (Fig. 7). ηSTH was calculated according to eqn (2) in which Jph is the photocurrent density, Vb is the applied external potential versus the Pt counter electrode, ηF is the faradaic efficiency for water splitting, and P is the power density of the incident light (100 mW cm−2).36 (2)
 Fig. 7  Photocurrent density and associated solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, ηSTH (%), measured by means of a two-electrode configuration using a Pt counter electrode that represents ηSTH of 0.235% at 1.0 V vs. Pt CE. 
At 1.0 V (vs. Pt CE) bias potential, the obtained photocurrent amounted to 2.12 mA cm−2, corresponding to maximum ηSTH = 0.235%. High biased potential was attributed to low solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency, which was originated from the relative low position of conduction band of WO3. The faradaic efficiencies for hydrogen and oxygen were measured under 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 V (vs. Pt CE), and their average faradaic efficiency was 93.7 (±0.6%), with 2:1 ratio of hydrogen to oxygen, confirming the measured photocurrents were produced indeed by water splitting (Fig. S2 and Table S2†).
Conclusions
We fabricated coatings of porous BiVO4 films on 1-D WO3 nanorod arrays for photoanodes employed in solar water splitting to increase the surface area at the BiVO4/electrolyte interface, as well as to improve the electron transport along the WO3 nanostructures. Addition of organic binders such as PVAc or EC in the precursor solution changed the morphology of the BiVO4-coating layer and, in particular, porous nanostructures with EC resulted in improved photocurrents. Moreover, the photocurrent of 1-D WO3/BiVO4/Co-Pi was enhanced up to 3.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE if the Co-Pi catalysts was decorated on the 1-D WO3/BiVO4 surface, thereby improving the kinetics of water oxidation. We also measured that the faradaic efficiency for water splitting was 93.7% with the 1-D WO3/BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanodes. ηSTH of 1-D WO3/BiVO4/Co-Pi may be improved further by the use of a photovoltaic cell that can provide extra bias potential. Because of the difficulty of finding a single material that satisfies all of the complicated requirements for solar water splitting, dual bandgap photoelectrodes, consisting of two different semiconductor materials, have been studied to a large extent. We expect that the geometrical combination of a porous shell and a 1-D nanostructured core is well applicable to other dual bandgap photoelectrode materials, even for photocathodes.
