Previous research observed that surface oxygen vacancies (SOVs) affected the catalytic activity for triiodide/iodide (I−/I3−) and T2/T− (T− = 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole ion) redox mediators in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). However, the electrocatalytic properties of larger and steric metal complex redox mediators (cobalt complex, ferrocenium) on SOVs of W18O49 are unclear and have never been reported. In this study, we investigated the electrocatalytic properties of cobalt complex and ferrocenium redox mediators on SOVs of W18O49. Results indicated that the catalytic performance of W18O49 nanowires (NWs) as a counter electrode for cobalt complex and ferrocenium redox mediators was comparable to that of Pt. After SOVs filling, the reduction reaction activity of the cobalt complex decreases slightly whereas it increases slightly for ferrocenium. These findings enrich our understanding of heterogeneous catalytic reactions on the surface of transition metal complexes for different redox mediators.
Introduction
As a result of global warming and the exhaustion of petroleum resources, developing renewable energy has become one of the major scientific issues and challenges. Photoelectrochemical cells1 and water splitting2 are attractive methods to scientists and manufacturers. As the central component of photoelectrochemical cells or water splitting devices, redox mediators perform the functions of electron transfer and dye regeneration.3 Iodide/triiodine redox mediator (I−/I3−) is the most commonly used electrolyte in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs).4 In recent years, other redox mediators have been developed for matching with dyes, thereby yielding high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Lately, DSCs incorporating cobalt-complex as redox mediator and porphyrin as sensitizer achieved a record-setting PCE of 13%.5 In addition, other metal complex redox (Fe, Cu, and Ni) and organic redox mediators have also been designed and used in DSCs.6
The counter electrode (CE) of DSCs is used to collect electrons from the external circuit and for electrocatalytic reduction of redox mediators. Although Pt is the most widely used CE catalyst for iodine/iodide redox mediators, several disadvantages limit its practical application. The scarcity and high cost of Pt cannot meet the needs of mass industrial production. On the other hand, Pt is not always the best catalyst for all redox mediators. For example, Pt is an inefficient catalyst for alkali metal polysulfide electrolyte (S2−/Sn2−), which is used in quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs),7 or for organic disulfide electrolyte, which is used in DSCs.8 Therefore, the development of low-cost, high-performance catalysts is highly desirable to replace the Pt used in energy conversion.9–11
Tungsten oxides, which are important transition metal compounds, have various practical applications in many fields, such as in optical devices, gas sensors, and catalysts.12 In the field of catalysts, tungsten oxides are also a hot research topic because of their notable catalytic properties.13–17 Our group reported that WO2 nanorods showed excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide to iodide in DSCs, while WO3 was inefficient catalysts as CE.18 Lee et al. reported the use of ordered mesoporous tungsten suboxide as a catalyst for a CE in T2/T− (T− = 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole ion) electrolyte-based DSCs.19 They confirmed that the partial reduction of tungsten oxide had a powerful effect on the catalytic activity for T2/T− mediator. Yang et al. transformed electrocatalytically inactive commercial WO3 into an efficient CE material for I−/I3− mediator via facile hydrogen treatment.20 Recently, we found that oxygen-vacancy-rich W18O49 was an efficient catalyst when used as CEs in DSCs for both I−/I3− and T2/T− redox mediators.8 However, the influence of SOVs on the electrocatalytic properties of larger redox mediators with steric molecular configurations (cobalt complex, ferrocenium) redox mediators in DSCs is unclear.
In this study, electrocatalytic properties of Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridyl) and Fc/Fc+ (Fc = ferrocene) on SOVs of W18O49 were investigated. Results indicated that the catalytic performance of W18O49 nanaowires (NWs) as a counter electrode for cobalt complex and ferrocenium redox mediators was comparable to that of Pt. Unlike notable dependence on SOVs for small I−/I3−, the electrocatalytic activity for larger redox mediators with steric molecular configurations (cobalt complex and ferrocenium) demonstrated less dependence on SOVs. The reduction reaction activity of cobalt complex decreased slightly after SOVs filling. By contrast, the reduction reaction activity of ferrocenium increased slightly after SOVs filling. These findings clarified the catalytic properties of SOVs for larger and steric metal complex redox mediators and were helpful for the rational search for highly active Pt-like catalysts for use with different redox mediators.
Experimental section
Synthesis of W18O49 nanowires
W18O49 nanowires were synthesized via the solvothermal utilizing WCl6 (0.1 g) in ethanol (50 ml) at 180 °C for 24 hours.21 WCl6 was dissolved in ethanol to form clear yellow solution that was then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave. After being heated at 180 °C for 24 h, the mixture was cooled to room temperature naturally. The product was collected by centrifugation and washed repeatedly with water and ethanol, finally followed by vacuum drying at 45 °C overnight.
Preparation of catalysts electrode
W–OV–W. As-synthesized W18O49 powders were dispersed in isopropanol. Then obtained suspension was sprayed on FTO glass (0.8 cm × 10 cm). The obtained films were sintered in nitrogen atmosphere at 500 °C for 30 min.
W–O–W. In order to prevent disturbance in operation, a half of electrodes in W–OV–W was cut for oxidation treatment. Then, the cut electrode was transferred to tube furnace, whose ends are open to air. Filling SOVs was carried out at 350 °C for 1 h. Then the electrodes were cooled to room temperature. If increasing the treatment temperature, the W18O49 were converted to WO3 with light yellow.
Pt electrode. The noble metal Pt electrodes were fabricated by pyrolysis H2PtCl6 on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass as previously reported.22,23
Electrolyte composition for CV
The cobalt redox couple was synthesized by the literature method.24 The electrolyte based on [Co(bpy)3][ClO4]2/[Co(bpy)3][(bpy)3]3[ClO4]3 redox mediator was composed of 10 mM LiClO4, 10 mM [Co(bpy)3][ClO4]2 and 1 mM NOBF4 in acetonitrile. The electrolyte based on Fc/FcPF6 redox mediator was composed of 10 mM LiClO4, 10 mM Fc and 1 mM ferrocenium hexafluorophosphate (FcPF6) in acetonitrile.
Electrolyte composition for Tafel, EIS and DSCs
The electrolyte based on [Co(bpy)3][ClO4]2/[Co(bpy)3][(bpy)3]3[ClO4]3 redox mediator was composed of 0.2 M LiClO4, 0.1 M [Co(bpy)3][ClO4]2, 0.01 M NOBF4 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine in acetonitrile. The electrolyte based on Fc/FcPF6 redox mediator was composed of 0.1 M LiClO4, 0.1 M Fc, 0.05 M FcPF6, 0.5 M and 4-tert-butyl pyridine in acetonitrile.
Solar cell fabrication
A layer of 20 nm-sized TiO2 (P25, Degussa, Germany) layer was printed on FTO glass.25 When the obtained films sintered at 500 °C were cooled to 90 °C, they were immersed in a solution of N719 dye (5 × 10−4 M) in acetonitrile–tert-butyl alcohol (1:1 volume ration) for 22 h or YD2-o-C8 dye (6 × 10−4 M) in ethanol for 5 h. The architecture of DSCs was assembled by sandwiching electrolyte with a sensitized TiO2 photo anode and a counter electrode. Compact TiO2 blocking layer is prepared according to literature.26
Characterizations
XRD patterns were obtained using PANalyticalX'Pert diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation at λ = 1.54 Å) sampling at 2° min−1, 40 kV and 100 mA. Nanostructures of our samples were characterized and analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Nova Nano SEM 450). The films thicknesses were measured using film-thickness measuring device (Surfcom 130A, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was carried out in Thermo ESCALAB 250. The photocurrent–voltage performance of the DSCs was measured by a Keithley digital source meter (Keithley 2601, USA) equipped with a solar simulator (PEC-L15, Peccell, Yokohama, Japan). EIS experiments were measured in the dummy cells in the dark using a computer-controlled potentiostat (ZenniumZahner, Germany). Tafel polarization measurements were carried out with an electrochemical workstation system (CHI630, Chenhua, and Shanghai) in a symmetrical dummy cell. Effective area of the symmetrical cells in the EIS and Tafel-polarization tests was 0.64 cm2.
Results and discussion
The energy levels and structures of Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ and Fc/Fc+ redox mediators are shown in Fig. 1a to c. W18O49 NWs are prepared by means of a solvothermal approach.8 W18O49 NWs CEs are then prepared by spraying its suspension onto FTO glass. The CE with abundant SOVs is designated as W–OV–W. Another CE treated by means of in situ filling of SOVs (Fig. 1e) in W–OV–W CEs is designated as W–O–W. Details of the preparation of W–OV–W and W–O–W CEs are included in the experimental section. Compared with W–OV–W CE (Fig. 1d), W–O–W CE (see SEM image in Fig. S1†) shows no obvious changes in morphology. The X-ray diffraction pattern shown in Fig. S2† further confirms that the tungsten oxide can be assigned to monoclinic W18O49, which has the largest oxygen vacancies within the range of WO2.625 to WO3.21 Furthermore, no crystalline phase variation can be found after SOVs filling. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy fitting results (Fig. S3†) clearly shows that most of the SOVs on W18O49 NWs have been eliminated for W–O–W CE. SOVs filling and maintenance of the morphology and crystal phase result in an accurate investigation of the electrocatalytic properties of Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ and Fc/Fc+ redox mediators on SOVs.

Electrocatalytic characterizations are performed to investigate the electrocatalytic properties of Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ and Fc/Fc+ redox mediators on SOVs of W18O49. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is used to examine the electrocatalytic activity of Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ and Fc/Fc+ redox mediators on three different CEs: W–OV–W, W–O–W, and Pt. Detailed CV characterizations are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2a, only one pair of redox peaks are observed for Co(bpy)3[ClO4]2/Co(bpy)3[ClO4]3 on three catalytic electrodes. The anodic and cathodic peak separation (ΔEP) of W–OV–W CE is only 158 mV, approaching that of Pt (153 mV) and indicating high reversibility. In addition, no obvious changes in ΔEP are observed after SOVs filling. The cathodic peak and anodic peak current is slightly decreased. For Fc/Fc+ redox mediators, one pair of redox peaks was also observed on three catalytic electrodes. The ΔEP of W–OV–W CE is also close to that of Pt and implying high electrocatalytic activity for Fc/Fc+. In addition, the electrocatalytic properties of Fc/Fc+ is different response to SOVs, as shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1. The ΔEP of Fc/Fc+ decreases slightly rather than increases after SOVs filling, which implies that electrocatalytic activity increases slightly after SOVs filling.

To verify the electrocatalytic properties of Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ and Fc/Fc+ redox mediators on SOVs of W18O49, Tafel-polarization was conducted with symmetrical cells consisting of two identical CEs. The values of the exchange current density (J0) in the Tafel zone were obtained, as shown in Table 1. J0 can be related to charge transfer resistance (Rct) using eqn (1): 
(1)where R denotes the gas constant, T stands for the temperature, F represents Faraday's constant, and n denotes the number of electrons involved in the reaction at the electrode. According to eqn (1), the small value of J0 causes a large Rct. As shown in Fig. 3a and Table 1, the values of J0 for W–OV–W and W–O–W are higher than that of Pt, which indicated that they exhibited high electrocatalytic activity for Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+. In addition, when the thickness of W–OV–W for Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ increased, the notable decreased in the Tafel zone could be attributed to the large mass transports in the thick film (Fig. S4†). After SOVs filling, the value of J0 slightly decreased, which demonstrated that electrocatalytic activity of Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ was less dependent on SOVs of W18O49. For Fc/Fc+ redox mediator, the value of J0 for W–OV–W and W–O–W were approaching to that of Pt. By contrast, the value of J0 increased from 0.39 to 0.55 mA cm−2 after SOVs filling, which indicated that reduction of SOVs on W18O49 was benefited to enhance electrocatalytic activity for Fc/Fc+. The above results verified the different effects of SOVs on the electrocatalytic properties of Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ and Fc/Fc+ redox mediators and agreed with the results of CV.

To further investigate the electrocatalytic properties of Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ and Fc/Fc+ redox mediators on SOVs of W18O49 in devices, DSCs were assembled using Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ and Fc/Fc+ redox mediators. Given the different mass transports and matches with dyes, different thicknesses of TiO2 films and dyes were selected for the different redox mediators. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained for these DSCs based on W–OV–W, W–O–W, and Pt under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 simulated illumination, as shown in Fig. 4. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 2. For Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ redox mediator, the performance of DSCs based on W–OV–W and W–O–W CEs can comparable to that based on Pt. After SOVs filling, PCEs was slightly decreased. This slightly decrement was mainly attributed to the reduction of the fill factor (FF) and current density. For Fc/Fc+ redox mediator, the serious recombination between Fc+ and bare FTO of the photo anode caused the low voltage and FF, as shown in Fig. S5a.† The compact TiO2 blocking layer efficiently inhibited the recombination between Fc+ and bare FTO of the photo anode, as indicated by the dark current (Fig. S5b†). Although the PCEs based on Fc/Fc+ were low, as shown in Fig. 4b, we could see that the parameters of DSCs base on W–OV–W and W–O–W were approaching to that of Pt. The PCEs slightly increased from 0.90% to 1.11% after SOVs filling. This result was agreed with results of CV and Tafel.

Using the same symmetrical cells as in the case of Tafel polarization, EIS measurements27 were performed to investigate the impedance between CEs and electrolytes based on redox mediators. Theoretically, each curve is composed of two irregular semicircles. The first one arises from the Rct at the CE/electrolyte interface. The second semicircle results from the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the redox mediators within the electrolyte. Moreover, the high frequency intercept on the real axis is the series resistance (Rs). The Rs values were obtained by fitting Nyquist plots with the “Z-view”,9 a well-known software, based on an equivalent circuit diagram (Fig. 5a). The fitting results of the Nyquist plots are listed in Table 1. For Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+, the Rs values for W18O49 catalysts before and after SOVs filling were almost the same but larger than that of the Pt CE. The Rct values for W–OV–W and W–O–W CEs were small and comparable to that of Pt, which confirmed that they had high electrocatalytic activity. For Fc/Fc+, the Rct values for W–OV–W and W–O–W CEs was 2.49 Ω and 2.40 Ω, respectively. The slight decrement of Rct for Fc/Fc+ after SOVs filling was observed.
The explanation for the different effects of SOVs on the electrocatalytic properties for Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ and Fc/Fc+ redox mediators is as follows. The diverse effects may have originated from the large and steric structure of Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ and Fc/Fc+ redox mediators and the adsorption site. As we all know, small molecules of iodine are preferentially adsorbed on metal atoms rather than on nonmetallic atoms in an inorganic complex.28 Thus, the iodine molecules should be adsorbed on top of W atoms sourced from the abundant SOVs for the subsequent catalysis. Therefore, the electrocatalytic activity of I−/I3− is notably affected by the abundant SOVs.8,19,20 However, the SOVs are too small to anchor the large volumes of steric redox mediators (Co(bpy)33+ and Fc), as shown in Scheme 1. Thus, their electrocatalytic activity is slightly susceptible to SOVs. In addition, the strong metal properties of the center iron atom in the ferrocene redox mediator may facilitate its preferentially adsorbance on nonmetal atoms rather than on metallic atoms in an inorganic complex, as shown in Scheme 1b. The details for this mechanism are currently under investigation.

Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the electrocatalytic properties of cobalt complex and ferrocenium redox mediators on SOVs of W18O49 in DSCs. We found that W18O49 NWs exhibited good electrocatalytic activity for Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ and Fc/Fc+ reduction reaction and were comparable to Pt. Results revealed different electrocatalytic properties of Co(bpy)32+/Co(bpy)33+ and Fc/Fc+ on the SOVs located on the surface of W18O49 NWs. Unlike notable dependence on the SOVs for small I−/I3−, the electrocatalytic activities for larger redox mediators with steric molecular configurations (cobalt complex, ferrocenium) were less dependence on the SOVs. The reduction reaction activities of the cobalt complex slightly decreased after SOVs filling. However, the reduction reaction activity of Fc/Fc+ slightly increased after SOVs filling. These findings are helpful to understand the heterogeneous catalytic reactions on the surface of transition metal complex for different redox mediators and can accelerate rational search for highly active catalysts for different redox mediators.
