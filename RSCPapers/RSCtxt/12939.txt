    , Accepted 24th February 2017First published on 27th February 2017AbstractA sustainable rapid microwave-solvothermal (MW-ST) synthesis approach has been successfully demonstrated to develop thiospinel NiCo2S4 nanocrystals and their nanohybrids with graphene nanosheets (GNS) using transition metal-ions (Co2+, Ni2+) and thiourea as a sulfur precursor in the presence of graphite oxide (GO). The MW-ST method enables the nucleation and growth of cubic linnaeite-type thiospinel NiCo2S4 nanocrystals and simultaneous in situ ultra-fast polyol-reduction of GO to GNS and its hybridization within 15 min at 200 °C using ethylene glycol (EG) as the solvent. This process absolutely evades the use of toxic reducing agents or post solid-state sintering at elevated temperatures and subsequent sulphurization using toxic H2S/Na2S gases. The nanocrystallite aggregates (NCS-1)/GNS nanohybrid exhibited a remarkable electro-catalytic activity towards triiodide (I−/I3−) reduction owing to improved electronic conductivity and synergistic effects at NCS-1 and GNS interfaces. The developed NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid as a novel counter electrode (CE) for Pt-free dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) demonstrated a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.98% in comparison to the conventional Pt CE of 8.01% under the same conditions. Hence, this work presents a scalable synthesis of an earth-abundant, thiospinel NiCo2S4/GNS nanohybrid CE via a facile single-step MW-ST process as a potential alternative to expensive Pt as a CE in DSSCs and other electrochemical clean energy systems.
1. Introduction
As a long-lasting solution for the rising global energy demand and associated environmental factors, the existing renewable energy technologies need to be developed using sustainable, low-cost and earth-abundant elements.1–3 Among the existing technologies, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) that come under third-generation solar cells have attracted much attention due to their ease of fabrication, low-cost and better performance in diverse light conditions.4 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a DSSC is categorically determined by its components (photoanode, counter electrode, dye and redox electrolyte). As a result, the development of efficient inorganic nanostructured electrode materials as well as their structural and morphological impact on the photovoltaic performance has become a major concern in the technological context.
A vital constituent of the DSSCs is the counter electrode (CE) which plays an important role in determining the PCE by harvesting electrons from the external circuit and serves as an electro-catalyst to regenerate redox species by reduction of I3− to I−.1–3 To ensure efficient functioning of DSSCs, an ideal CE material should possess the following prerequisites: high electro-catalytic activity, good conductivity, effective surface area, excellent long-term stability and compatibility with redox electrolytes.5 Conventionally, a thin layer of noble metal platinum (Pt) coated on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate has been used as a functional CE in DSSCs. However, the ease of corrosion by the redox species and lack of exposed surface area in addition to the expensive vacuum fabrication procedure (sputtering) for thin-film formation hamper the application of extremely expensive and rare earth element Pt for large scale commercialization in DSSCs. Therefore, the idea of designing and developing an economic, robust, earth-abundant CE as a suitable surrogate for Pt with significant electro-catalytic activity is one of the promising conduits.
In this regard, different polymorphs of carbon (such as graphite, carbon nanotubes and graphene), conducting polymers (polyaniline, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) and certain transition metal based carbides, oxides as well as sulphide materials have evolved as promising candidates for CE application in DSSCs.6–15
Among them, siegenite (NiCo2S4) with a normal thiospinel crystal structure exhibits remarkable electro-catalytic performance due to the synergistic interactions between Co2+/3+ and Ni2+ or possible interchangeable valency.16–19 The hierarchical nanostructured NiCo2S4 with urchin-like, porous sheet-like, hexagonal and flower-like morphologies has been extensively reported for application in supercapacitors, but only a few studies on NiCo2S4 as a potential CE for Pt-free DSSCs have been demonstrated.19–22
In general, hydro/solvothermal and electrochemical deposition methods are adopted for the synthesis of NiCo2S4 nanocrystals to achieve diverse morphologies. However, these methods have certain shortcomings such as multistep procedures, formation of metal carbonates and metal hydroxides, sintering at elevated temperature and the requirement for a subsequent sulphurization process to form thiospinel NiCo2S4 nanocrystals. These strategies also require post-solid-state annealing and utilization of toxic H2S/Na2S gas, which consume time as well as energy, leading to increased production cost. Therefore, the necessity to develop a suitable low-cost, scalable, facile, energy-efficient synthesis strategy to fabricate thiospinel NiCo2S4 nanocrystals in less reaction time has become vital to substantiate the scope of CE materials for Pt-free DSSC application.
Interestingly, the MW-HT/ST method has attracted wide attention as it offers a clean, energy-efficient, economical and time-saving process.23–25 The method facilitates the development of high quality nanostructured chalcogenide materials with desired morphology, without requiring any structure-directing agents.26–28 Recently, nanocomposites of carbon nanotube and graphene integrated transition metal-based electro-catalysts have attracted much research attention.29–33 Remarkably, the growth of nanocrystalline NiCo2S4 on graphene nanosheets (GNS) has been reported as the GNS serve as a two-dimensional electrical conductive scaffold to electroactive NiCo2S4 and also enhance charge transport factors, thereby refining the electrochemical performance for supercapacitor applications.34–36 To date, studies on NiCo2S4/GNS nanohybrids as a potential CE have not been reported for DSSC application. Furthermore, no work has been reported on a one-step, in situ MW-ST polyol-reduction synthesis of NiCo2S4/GNS nanohybrids as a CE in Pt-free DSSCs.
In this work, we have successfully demonstrated an energy-efficient, sustainable, microwave-assisted solvothermal (MW-ST) synthesis approach to develop NiCo2S4 nanocrystals with three different morphologies including nanocrystallite-aggregates (NCS-1), and tremella-like (NCS-2) and porous-bead-cum-needle-like (NCS-3) hierarchical nanostructures within a short reaction time of 15 min. The NCS-2 and NCS-3 morphologies of NiCo2S4 were obtained via a three-step MW-HT/ST process while NCS-1 was prepared using a single-step process. The synthesized NiCo2S4 nanocrystals were drop-cast onto FTO–glass and directly used as a CE for DSSC studies. Further, we modified the one-step MW-ST process to synthesize NCS-1 and GNS nanohybrids by in situ growth of NCS-1 upon GNS in the presence of ethylene glycol as a solvent without requiring any structure-directing agents, toxic gases and post solid-state sintering processes. The ultra-fast reduction of GO to GNS at a higher temperature of 200 °C simultaneously facilitates homogeneous decoration of NCS-1 on the surface of GNS resulting in improved electro-catalytic performance due to the synergistic interaction between NCS-1 and GNS. The as-synthesized NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid exhibited a significant PCE of 7.98% which was comparable to that of the conventional Pt of 8.01%, suggesting that it could serve as an ideal Pt-free counter electrode material for DSSCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the rapid MW-HT/ST synthesis of pristine NCS materials with varied morphologies and their GNS-based nanohybrids via in situ ultra-fast polyol-reduction for efficient Pt-free CEs in DSSC applications.
2. Experimental section

2.1 Rapid, one-step MW-ST synthesis of nanocrystallite aggregates of NiCo2S4 (NCS-1) and its GNS nanohybrid (NCS-1/GNS)
The reaction procedure for the scalable MW-ST synthesis of NCS-1 and NCS-1/GNS is as follows: to prepare the initial precursor solution at room temperature, nickel acetate (LobaChemie) and cobalt acetate (LobaChemie) at a molar ratio of 1:2 were added slowly into 80 mL of ethylene glycol (EG) (Fischer Scientific) with continuous stirring to attain a homogeneous pink colored solution. To this, 6 mM thiourea (Fischer Scientific) was added slowly and the resultant mixture was kept under stirring for a further 2 min. 20 mL of the above precursor mixture was loaded into each microwave quartz vessel and carefully placed on the turntable stage for uniform microwave heating in the Anton Paar microwave reaction system SOLV. The reaction temperature of 200 °C with 20 °C min−1 heating rate and 15 min exposure time was programmed using Anton-Paar MultiwavePro software. The automatic temperature and pressure control system aided constant monitoring and control of the internal temperature. The microwave system was operated at 2.45 GHz frequency. The black precipitate of NiCo2S4 nanocrystals was washed thrice using acetone and subsequently dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C. The schematic illustration of MW-ST synthesis of NCS-1 nanocrystals is shown in Fig. 1.
Further, the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid was synthesized by the same method with 30 mg of GO homogeneously dispersed in the precursor solution. The GO was prepared from graphite flakes using the ‘modified Hummers’ method as reported in earlier work.32,33 The detailed synthesis procedure is given in the ESI.† During the reaction, the in situ reduction of GO to GNS takes place in the polyol solvent. The resulting black nanocrystallite-aggregates of NiCo2S4 decorated graphene nanosheets (NCS-1/GNS) were then washed thrice with acetone and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C. The schematic illustration of the rapid, MW-ST synthesis of the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid is shown in Fig. 1.
2.2 Three-step MW-HT/ST synthesis of tremella-like NiCo2S4 (NCS-2) and porous-bead-cum-needle-like NiCo2S4 (NCS-3)
NCS-2 was synthesized via a three-step MW-HT process. In step I, nickel acetate (4 mM), cobalt acetate (8 mM) and urea (36 mM) were sequentially dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring until a homogeneous pink colored solution was obtained. 20 mL of the above precursor solution was loaded into each microwave quartz vessel and carefully placed on the turntable stage for uniform microwave heating in the Anton Paar microwave reaction system SOLV. The same reaction temperature of 200 °C with 20 °C min−1 heating rate and 15 min exposure time was programmed using Anton-Paar MultiwavePro software. The resulting pink colored Ni–Co metal carbonate hydroxide (MCH) solution was centrifuged and rinsed with deionized water. In step II, the obtained MCH powder was subjected to solid state sintering in a muffle furnace at 350 °C for 2 h to obtain black colored NiCo2O4. The conversion of NiCo2O4 to NiCo2S4 was accomplished via the rapid microwave-assisted sulphurization process using Na2S in step III. Herein 0.25 g of NiCo2O4 powder was dispersed in 80 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring and 0.75 g of Na2S·9H2O (Merck) was slowly added with constant stirring to get a black colored solution. The obtained solution was further transferred to MW quartz vessels for uniform microwave heating at 180 °C with 18 °C min−1 heating rate for 15 min. During the MW-ST reaction, anion-exchange of lattice oxygen with the sulphur atom from Na2S in NiCo2O4 takes place leading to the formation of thiospinel NiCo2S4. The obtained black colored NiCo2S4 (NCS-2) precipitate was washed thrice with deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. The schematic illustration of the three-step MW-HT/ST synthesis of NCS-2 is illustrated in Fig. 2.
Further, the porous-bead-cum-needle-like NCS-3 morphology was obtained by the same method as used for NCS-2 by adding 0.5 g of Pluronic P-123 (Sigma-Aldrich), a tri-block polymer surfactant, into the mixed solvent of EG and H2O (1:1) in step I. The reaction temperature of 200 °C with 20 °C min−1 heating rate and 15 min exposure time was programmed using Anton-Paar MultiwavePro software. The obtained black colored NiCo2S4 (NCS-3) precipitate was washed thrice with deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. The schematic illustration of the three-step MW-HT/ST synthesis of NCS-3 is illustrated in Fig. 2.
2.3 Material characterization
The crystal structure of the synthesized samples was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies using a RigakuUltima IV X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) at 40 kV and 30 mA to scan the diffraction angles from 5 to 70°. The phase identification was carried out using standard patterns reported in the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) database. The surface morphologies of the synthesized samples were imaged using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM-SUPRA-55-Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) images were acquired using a transmission electron microscope (JOEL/JEM 2100, USA). Room-temperature confocal Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw inVia system with the excitation energy of a 514 nm laser. The valance state of the synthesized samples was determined by X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS) analysis using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha+ System, UK.
2.4 DSSC device fabrication and characterization
The photoanodes for DSSCs were prepared using the doctor-blade technique, referring to our earlier studies.23,24 The details of CE fabrication, assembly of the DSSC devices and device characterization are given in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis, and XRD and FESEM characterization of NiCo2S4 (NCS) and the NiCo2S4–GNS hybrid (NCS/GNS)
NCS-1 and NCS-1/GNS samples were synthesized via the facile MW-ST method in polyol medium. During the synthesis of the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid, EG serves not only as a reducing agent to obtain GNS from GO, but also as a solvent with chelating properties that prevent the agglomeration of NCS-1 nanoparticles. Interestingly, GO offers many defects or functional groups as nucleation sites and also acts as a two-dimensional scaffold to facilitate in situ growth of NiCo2S4 nanocrystallite aggregates.30
During the MW-ST process, the microwaves generate dipole rotation in the EG molecule which results in alignment and relaxation of the polar component in the field of fluctuating electromagnetic radiation. The degenerated energy from the rotation of the dipole results in increased thermal energy within the EG solvent, leading to increased solvothermal reduction kinetics of GO to GNS with decorated NCS-1 from its inorganic precursors at 200 °C without any post solid-state sintering at high temperatures in an inert/reducing gas atmosphere. The hydroxyl group in EG forms several coordinate bonds with Co2+ and Ni2+ yielding stable metal complexes. During the MW-ST process, the hydrophilic functional groups (–OH and –COOH) on the GO surface get readily adsorbed to the metal complexes and react with thiourea (S2−) to form NiCo2S4 nanocrystallite-aggregates. Simultaneously, the GO is reduced to GNS via the ultra-fast in situ polyol process. This mechanism results in the synthesis of NCS-1/GNS nanohybrids under MW-ST conditions.
For a comparative study, we also investigated the morphology-based three-step synthesis of NiCo2S4 from metal carbonate hydroxide (MCH) precursor via the MW-HT/ST process and solid-state sintering of MCH-precursor and subsequent MW-HT/ST assisted sulphurization processes.

Fig. 3a, c and d demonstrates the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of NCS-1, NCS-2 and NCS-3 obtained by the MW-HT/ST method. The diffraction peaks at 16.3°, 26.6°, 31.6°, 38.3°, 47.4°, 50.6° and 55.2° were well indexed to the (111), (220), (311), (400), (422), (511) and (440) planes, respectively, confirming the phase-pure linnaeite-type cubic NiCo2S4 nanocrystal formation (JCPDS card no. 20-0782).20 The sharp diffraction peaks elucidated the crystalline nature of NiCo2S4 obtained by the MW-HT/ST process within a short reaction time. The XRD pattern of the MW-ST synthesized NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid in EG solvent at 200 °C in 15 min is shown in Fig. 3b. The patterns indicated the nanocrystalline conservation of NiCo2S4 particles. No additional peaks of GNS were observed possibly due to its low content. The strong diffraction peaks of NiCo2S4 with the overlapping diffraction peak of GNS were attributed to the good crystallinity and higher content of NiCo2S4 in the nanohybrid.

As NiCo2S4 nanoparticles attached onto the surface of GNS prevented the aggregation and restacking of graphene nanosheets, the diffraction intensity of GNS was weakened.33 The diffraction peak obtained at 31.6° illustrated the alignment of the (311) crystal plane along the cubic NiCo2S4 in all the NCS samples. Fig. 3e and f show the XRD patterns of GNS and GO respectively. Herein, a major shift of the (002) reflection plane from 11.2° to 23.8° was observed after the MW-ST reaction, which confirmed the conversion of GO to GNS. The broader diffraction peaks indicated the highly amorphous nature of GNS, in good accordance with the previous reports.32,33
The morphological features and size of the as-synthesized NiCo2S4 nanocrystals from two different reaction strategies as represented in Fig. 1 and 2 were characterized by FE-SEM analysis. The FE-SEM images of the NCS-1 sample obtained by the one-step MW-ST method revealed the aggregated morphology of the nanocrystals as shown in Fig. 4a. These NCS-1 nanocrystals comprised numerous inter-connected nanoparticles that aided better electronic conductivity through consistent particle-to-particle contacts. Fig. 4b presents the FE-SEM image of the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid prepared by the one-step facile MW-ST method, showing the presence of NiCo2S4 nanocrystallite-aggregates decorated on the surface of graphene nanosheets.

The inset figures show the magnified FE-SEM images of the respective samples. 
This clearly confirmed that no significant change in the morphology occurred even after nanohybrid formation of NCS-1 with GNS.
GNS served as a conductive scaffold owing to its 2-dimensional (2D) layered structure to provide better interfacial adhesion of the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid to the FTO-substrate and boost electronic conductivity when applied as a CE for Pt-free DSSCs. Fig. 4c shows an FE-SEM image of the NCS-2 sample synthesized via the three-step MW-HT method. The hierarchical morphology exhibited a ‘tremella-fungi’ like structure, with several exposed flake-like surfaces and larger pores. Such morphologies are desirable to facilitate better diffusion of the electrolyte to the catalytic CE in DSSCs. Fig. 4d presents an FE-SEM image of the NCS-3 sample prepared via the three-step MW-HT/ST method, which clearly exhibits numerous interconnected porous bead-like particles. The NCS-3 sample at higher magnifications indicated many needle-like structures in addition to porous beads. This porous bead-cum-needle-like morphology of NCS-3 was obtained in the presence of Pluronic-123 surfactant that formed micelles and subsequently yielded mesoporous structures. Fig. 5a–d depicts the FE-SEM images of various electro-catalysts such as NCS-1, the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid, NCS-2 and NCS-3 respectively on the surface of the FTO-substrate. Each cross-sectional FE-SEM image (inset) of the drop-cast electro-catalyst film clearly shows the virtual thickness of the fabricated CEs in the range of 6–11 μm. It is also confirmed that the morphology of the as-synthesized samples remained unaffected even after the thin-film deposition.

Inset figures show the thickness of the different NiCo2S4 nanocrystals drop-casted on FTO. 
3.2 HR-TEM characterization of NCS-1 and the NCS-1/GNS hybrid
The morphologies and the crystalline nature of the NCS-1 and NCS-1/GNS hybrid were further investigated by HR-TEM analysis as shown in Fig. 6a and b. The HR-TEM image of NCS-1 presented in Fig. 6a illustrates the assembly of nanocrystallite aggregates with a mean diameter of 64 ± 6 nm. The HR-TEM image of the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid presented in Fig. 6b illustrates the poly-crystalline nature of the NiCo2S4 crystals. The d-spacing between the lattice fringes was close to 2.85 Å, which confirmed the preferential growth of NiCo2S4 crystals along the (311) plane. Thus the HR-TEM result correlates with the obtained XRD pattern of cubic NiCo2S4. Further, Fig. 6b clearly shows a ‘folding-pattern’ which was attributed to the presence of amorphous graphene sheets in the nanohybrid sample. Fig. 6c presents the FE-SEM image of the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid and the respective elemental mapping images by EDS are presented in Fig. 6d–g indicating the distribution of Ni, Co, S and C in the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid sample without any elemental exclusion. Fig. 6h shows the FESEM-EDS spectra of the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid indicating a Ni:Co:S stoichiometric ratio of 1:2:4.

3.3 XPS spectra of NiCo2S4 nanocrystallite aggregates (NCS-1)
The surface composition as well as the electronic state of the elements present in NCS-1 was analyzed using XPS analysis. The core spectra of individual elements of NCS-1 are given in Fig. 7. The Ni 2p core level spectrum of NCS-1 in Fig. 7a specified the Ni atoms in 2p3/2 electronic configuration at 857.6 eV, which confirmed the divalent and trivalent states of the Ni atom. The peak at 877.6 eV relates to the Ni 2p1/2 configuration.
 Fig. 7  High resolution XPS spectra of (a) Ni 2p, (b) Co 2p and (c) S 2p of NiCo2S4 nanocrystalline aggregates synthesized via the MW-ST method. 
The Co 2p spectrum in Fig. 7b denoted two strong peaks at 781.5 eV and 799.3 eV assigned to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 respectively with a spin energy separation of 17.8 eV.19,31 The peak at 61.9 eV in Fig. 7c was characteristic of the S2− ion in a low coordination state whereas the peak at 168.1 eV corresponded to metal to S (sulfur) bonds. Thus, the XPS analysis of the NiCo2S4 sample evidently confirmed the surface state as Co2+, Co3+, Ni2+, Ni3+ and S2− consistent with the reported literature.22
3.4 Confocal Raman spectroscopic characterization
Confocal Raman spectroscopy is considered as a potential tool to investigate the presence of graphene nanosheets in the synthesized NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid. Fig. 8 displays the Raman spectra of GO and the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid. The spectra exhibited well-defined D-bands and G-bands of carbon based materials. The band at 1325 cm−1 was associated with structural defects/disorders and was designated as the ‘D’ band, which was due to the breathing mode of k-point phonons of A1g symmetry. The ‘G’ band centered at 1585 cm−1 originated from the E2g phonon of sp2 atoms of carbon corresponding to the stretching vibrations in the basal plane of graphene. The peak intensity ratio between the D- and G-bands (ID/IG) provides a useful index to compare the degree of crystallinity of various carbon materials, i.e. the smaller the ratio of ID/IG, the higher the degree of ordering for the carbon material. The ID/IG ratio of the synthesized GO and NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid was found to be 1.03 and 1.34 respectively. The increase in the value of the hybrid sample demonstrated the presence of more defective or disordered carbon, clearly suggesting interactions between NCS-1 and GNS.29,34,35 The flawlessly correlating data elucidate that the one-step MW/ST process using a non-toxic solvent (EG) is an energy-efficient method to produce pristine NiCo2S4 and NiCo2S4/GNS nanohybrids for several applications.

3.5 Electrochemical performance of CEs
The electro-catalytic performance of pristine NiCo2S4, and the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid as well as Pt CEs was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, using a three electrode system with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and Pt wire as the CE with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The samples were drop cast for preparing the working electrode. The electrolyte consisted of 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2 and 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile. Fig. 9a shows the cyclic voltammetry analysis of all CEs. Two pairs of redox peaks were detected for all the samples. The negative redox pair (Ox-I and Red-I) was assigned to the oxidation and reduction of I−/I3−, whereas the positive redox pair (Ox-II and Red-II) was assigned to I2/I3−, as explained with the equations below: I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(2)
 Fig. 9  (a) Cyclic voltammetry analysis of iodide/triiodide redox species for different morphologies of NiCo2S4, the NCS-1/GNS hybrid and Pt CEs with a measured scan rate of 50 mV S−1 and (b) comparative impedance spectra of different CEs with the inset representing the equivalent circuit used to fit the impedance spectra. 
Since the CE in DSSCs accounts for the catalytic reduction of I3− to I−, the main focus of our work was to analyse the greater negative redox pair of NCS-derived samples.34 Further, the peak currents and peak separation (Epp) are crucial parameters for determining the catalytic activity of the fabricated CEs.15 The peak separation (Epp) is negatively correlated with the rate constant of a redox reaction as calculated using the following equation:Epp = |Ep(anodic) − Ep(cathodic)|
From the CV curves, it is clear that the current density obtained for all NiCo2S4 CEs and the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid CE was higher compared to Pt. This was attributed to greater CE film thickness with high surface area and porosity as realised from the FE-SEM images shown in Fig. 4 and 5. Owing to higher thickness, the intimate contact between the redox electrolyte and electro-catalyst resulted in capacitive behaviour, resulting in higher current density.20 The CV curves for the Pt CE exhibited an obvious Red-I peak at −0.62 V with a peak separation Epp of 0.45 V. The Epp for all CEs except NCS-3 was less in comparison to the drop-cast Pt CE suggesting that all the fabricated CEs were electro-catalytically very active towards the reduction of I3− to I−. The detailed electrochemical performance parameters for cyclic voltammograms of the I−/I3− redox couple with different CEs are given in Table 1. Among the prepared morphologies, the NCS-1 yielded lower Epp (337 mV), signifying better catalytic activity. Interestingly, the Epp value was further reduced for the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid. The nanohybrid sample also showed the highest peak current as given in Table 1. Thus, our results strongly suggest a synergistic effect between the NCS-1 and GNS that efficiently improved the charge transfer mobility between the interfaces and led to enriched catalytically active sites. To understand the charge transfer process of the as-fabricated CEs at the electrode–electrolyte interface for tri-iodide (I3−) reduction, an electro-chemical impedance analysis was carried out using dummy cells fabricated in a symmetric cell configuration with NiCo2S4 CEs. Fig. 9b shows the Nyquist plots of CEs which compare the charge transport properties of various CEs of NiCo2S4, the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid and Pt. The inset presents the equivalent circuit used for the perfect fit of plots to obtain the charge transport and charge transfer parameters inside the cells. The high frequency intercept of the EIS spectra on the Z′-axis (real axis) denotes series/sheet resistance (Rs), the semicircle at the large frequency part (left) denotes charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the one at lesser frequency (right) originates from the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the tri-iodide/iodide redox couple. As shown in Table 1, the Rct for NCS-1, the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid, NCS-2, NCS-3 and Pt was calculated to be 2.84, 1.72, 3.87, 3.75 and 1.24 Ω cm−2 respectively. The lowest Rct was related to a quicker charge-transfer kinetics which could be due to the larger electro-catalytically active area of CE.

It was observed that NCS-2 and NCS-3 CEs exhibited higher Rct values (Table 2) resulting in reduced catalytic activity. This may be due to the synthesis route that involved urea as the oxide precursor. In comparison to NCS-1, the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid exhibited much lower Rct indicating higher catalytic activity. This was mainly ascribed to NCS-1/GNS hybrid formation that serves as a dominant pathway for electronic conduction and the synergistic interaction between NCS-1 and GNS. Thus EIS studies demonstrated the effective charge transfer at the redox electrolyte/NiCo2S4 CE interface resulting in enhanced electro-catalytic performance of Pt and NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid CEs towards the electrolyte reduction reaction. The semicircles in the Nyquist impedance spectra are associated with kinetically controlled reactions. Thus, the larger frequency intercepts obtained on the real axis (Z′ axis) exhibited ohmic series resistance that involved sheet resistivity of the electrodes.22 Among all CEs, Pt showed a lower ohmic series resistance (Rs) of 15.81 Ω cm−2 and revealed better electronic adhesion to FTO. Pristine NCS-1 and NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid CEs exhibited a substantial sheet resistance of 15.82 Ω cm−2 and 16.26 Ω cm−2 respectively. Both NCS-2 and NCS-3 samples also showed a higher sheet resistance of 16.98 Ω cm−2 and 17.39 Ω cm−2 respectively. The lower Rct and lower ohmic resistance of the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid compared to NCS-1 substantiates better catalytic performance for the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid as a CE towards I−/I3− electrolyte reduction reaction.

3.6 Photovoltaic properties
The comparison of the PCE, i.e. the photocurrent density vs. voltage (J–V) curve, of the fabricated DSSC devices with different NiCo2S4 materials is demonstrated in Fig. 10a and the equivalent photovoltaic parameters such as open circuit photovoltage (Voc), short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and fill-factor (FF) of different counter electrodes are summarized in Table 2. The nanocrystallite-aggregate sample (NCS-1) showed a PCE of 6.1% with a Voc of 0.73 V and a FF of 71.93%. The tremella-like NiCo2S4 sample (NCS-2) showed a PCE of 4.08% while the porous bead-cum-needle-like NiCo2S4 sample (NCS-3) showed a PCE of 4.73% with a higher photo-current density (Jsc) of 10.05 mA cm−2. Both the NCS-2 and NCS-3 samples showed a similar open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). Compared to the Voc of the NCS-2 and NCS-3 samples, the high Voc of NCS-1 was attributed to better contact of the electro-catalyst with the FTO-substrate and better conductive channels due to inter-connected nanocrystallite-aggregate particles that was evident from FE-SEM analysis. The considerably lower electro-catalytic performance of NCS-2 compared to NCS-1 and NCS-3 was anticipated due to the presence of large pores in different flake-like nanostructures, causing weaker adhesion and less electronic conduction. To deeply investigate the CE performance of the NiCo2S4/GNS nanohybrid, a standard Pt CE and GNS CE were also fabricated and PV measurements were performed under similar conditions.

(b) A comparative histogram of power conversion efficiencies (PCE) versus respective counter electrodes (CEs). (c) Comparative IPCE spectra of DSSCs fabricated with different morphologies of pristine NiCo2S4, NCS-1/GNS hybrid, Pt and pristine GNS counter electrodes showing high photoresponse. 
A maximum PCE of 8.01% with a Jsc of 16.81 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.7 V and a FF of 67.65% was obtained for Pt CE-based DSSCs. Among all NiCo2S4 samples, NCS-1 exhibited a maximum PCE of 6.1% while pristine GNS showed a PCE of only 3.94%. To enhance the electro-catalytic performance, a hybrid of NCS-1 and GNS using the one-step, in situ MW-ST process was synthesized. Interestingly, the counter electrode made of the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid showed a promising PCE of 7.98%, which is very close to that of the conventional DSSCs made with standard Pt as CE (8.01%). The Jsc obtained was 15.62 mA cm−2 with a Voc of 0.72 V and a FF of 70.58%. The high FF value corroborated with the impedance results. In general, the superior conductive CE reduces ohmic resistance which accounts for higher FF. The high FF obtained in our NCS-1/GNS hybrid CE was due to superior adhesion of the electro-catalyst onto the FTO glass that resulted in the highly conductive nature of NiCo2S4.37 The comparative PCE values versus respective CEs are shown in Fig. 10b. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the 6 sets of DSSCs consisting of 5 identical cells of each CE with different NiCo2S4 morphologies, GNS and their respective nanohybrids with standard deviation from the average values for Jsc, Voc, FF and PCEs are also summarized in Table 2.
Further, the stability of DSSCs assembled with different CEs was also studied over a period of 30 days and is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The NCS-2, NCS-3 and GNS CE-based DSSCs attained PCEs up to 93.6%, 94.7% and 93.99%, respectively, compared to the initial value. However, the NCS-1 and NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid CE-based DSSCs exhibited PCEs up to 99.31% and 98.7% of their initial value, which was significantly comparable to that of the conventional Pt-based CE (99.12%).

Fig. 10c shows the IPCE curves of the fabricated DSSCs with the synthesized CEs. The IPCE spectra indicated a similar photo-electric response within the wavelength ranging from 400 to 750 nm. The results showed the highest photo-response of 71% and 69.5% for conventional Pt and NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid CE-based DSSCs respectively. The enhanced photo-response of these CE based DSSCs was found to be consistent with their Jsc values.37 These results were corroborated with J–V, EIS and CV analysis. Thus, we propose the NiCo2S4/GNS nanohybrid as one of the promising alternative counter electrodes for Pt-free DSSCs. Additionally, the synthesis approaches could also pave the way for developing various chalcogenide nanocrystals and their nanohybrids for clean energy conversion and storage devices via a rapid, sustainable and energy-efficient MW route.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully demonstrated a rapid, single-step, sustainable synthesis of nanocrystallite-aggregates of thiospinels NiCo2S4 (NCS-1) within a short reaction time (15 min) by a microwave-solvothermal (MW-ST) method without requiring any high temperature sintering and reducing toxic gas atmosphere, thereby lowering the manufacturing cost. Furthermore, one-step MW-ST in situ polyol-reduction of graphite oxide (GO) into GNS with inorganic precursors of NCS-1 at 200 °C within 15 min simplified the preparation of the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrids. The NiCo2S4 nanocrystallite aggregate-decorated GNS nanohybrid as an electro-catalyst demonstrated excellent catalytic activity toward tri-iodide reduction and a promising PCE of 7.98%, which was close to that of the Pt CE (8.01%) under similar experimental conditions. To understand the morphology dependent electro-catalytic performance, NCS-1, and NiCo2S4 with tremella-like (NCS-2) and porous-bead-cum-needle-like nanostructure (NCS-3) were also successfully synthesized via a three-step oxide-route, MW-HT/ST process. Among all CEs, NCS-1 and the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid exhibited higher PCEs than NCS-2 and NCS-3. The electro-chemical performance revealed a synergistic effect between NiCo2S4 and GNS. The EIS revealed lower Rct and ohmic resistance of the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid CE, correlating with J–V and IPCE results. The high performance of the NCS-1/GNS nanohybrid was proficient due to the rich redox chemistry of nickel and cobalt ions, better electronic conductivity and better adhesion caused by synergistic coupling interactions at the interfaces of NiCo2S4 and graphene nanosheets. Thus, the present study could open up a new route to prepare low-cost and energy-efficient alternative counter electrodes instead of using expensive Pt via a rapid, scalable MW-HT/ST approach for DSSCs and other clean energy systems.
