    , Accepted 22nd May 2016First published on 23rd May 2016AbstractA question at issue in triplet–triplet annihilation-based photon upconversion (TTA-UC) has been how to maximize the anti-Stokes shift, which requires minimization of the energy losses in intersystem crossing (ISC) of donors and consequent energy transfer (TTET) to acceptors. This is resolved by the energy level matching between a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizer and emitters with the highest triplet and singlet energy levels.
There is an emerging demand for the effective production of electric and chemical energy by utilizing solar energy. The efficiencies of all such sunlight-powered devices are limited by their bandgap; photons having lower energy than that of the bandgap cannot be harvested. For example, efficient photocatalytic water splitting for H2 evolution requires UV and deep blue (<420 nm) light,1 but it is only 7% of the total solar irradiance in terms of energy (100 mW cm−2), and thus 93% is lost. Similarly, recently emerged highly efficient perovskite solar cells harvest photons up to 800 nm,2–4 where 40% of solar irradiance is wasted.
Photon upconversion (UC), converting lower-energy photons into higher-energy photons, has attracted increasing attention for the recovery of unused sub-bandgap photons. Among the several UC mechanisms, the UC based on triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) is particularly attractive since it works under weak excitation intensity such as that of solar irradiance.5–16Fig. 1a shows the common scheme of TTA-UC. First, a donor (sensitizer) molecule is excited to a S1 state, followed by intersystem crossing (ISC) to a T1 state. It then shows donor-to-acceptor (emitter) triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) and subsequent TTA between two acceptor triplets, which consequently produces an emissive acceptor S1 state.
 Fig. 1  (a) Scheme for the common mechanism of TTA-UC. First, the donor absorbs low energy light to produce the excited singlet state (S1). Second, the donor triplet (T1) is populated through intersystem crossing (ISC). Third, donor-to-acceptor triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) forms an acceptor T1. Finally, triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) produces a high-energy acceptor S1 which radiates upconverted photons. (b) Scheme for TTA-UC with a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) donor. Extremely small energy loss (<100 meV) during ISC leads to a larger energy gain (anti-Stokes shift) in the entire TTA-UC process. (c) Chemical structures of a TADF-type donor 4CzIPN and UV-emitting acceptors TP and QP. 
One of the current problems of TTA-UC is the energy loss during the donor ISC process, namely the S1–T1 energy gap (ΔEST), and the succeeding TTET process. This reduces the energy gain of the total TTA-UC process (Fig. 1a). As the energy level of an acceptor T1 needs to be lower than that of a donor T1, the energy loss during donor ISC severely limits the choice of acceptors. These issues hamper the development of efficient visible-to-UV and near infrared (NIR)-to-visible TTA-UC. For example, cyclometalated Ir complexes are typical donors for visible-to-UV TTA-UC, which show T1 levels located around 2.1 eV.17–19 Pyrene derivatives, whose T1 is at ca. 2.1 eV, have been used to receive triplet energy from these Ir complexes.17–19 However, it has been difficult to utilize UV emitters with higher T1 and S1 levels, although they are beneficial for obtaining a larger anti-Stokes shift.
In this work, to expand the scope of choice of acceptors and to increase the total energy gain in TTA-UC, we utilize a donor that exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), thanks to its extremely small S1–T1 gap (ΔEST, Fig. 1b). The TADF molecules have recently shown a great success in the development of efficient electroluminescence devices.20,21 The small ΔEST value enables efficient T1 → S1 reverse ISC, resulting in a TADF emission from the S1 state. Baldo and coworkers have employed a TADF compound as a donor in TTA-UC for the first time.22,23 From the viewpoint of TTA-UC, TADF materials are attractive for two reasons. First, the small ΔEST values also allow efficient S1 → T1 ISC, being suitable for triplet sensitization without the use of heavy atoms. Second, the small ΔEST values reduce the energy loss during ISC and widen the choice of acceptors, as discussed above. However, its potential to sensitize emitters with high T1/S1 energy levels, being useful to boost photocatalytic devices, has not been fully explored. Here we employ a prototypical TADF molecule based on carbazolyl dicyanobenezene, 4CzIPN20 (Fig. 1c), as a triplet donor. We show an efficient visible-to-UV TTA-UC by combining 4CzIPN with a UV-emitting acceptor p-quarterphenyl (QP) with high T1 (2.4 eV)24 and S1 (3.5 eV) energy levels. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the small ΔEST value of 4CzIPN (0.083 eV),20 we successfully carried out visible-to-UV TTA-UC with an acceptor p-terphenyl (TP) that has the highest T1 (2.5 eV)25 and S1 (3.6 eV) energy levels ever employed in TTA-UC. The energy diagram of the whole TTA-UC process is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
We studied the TTA-UC properties of a mixed benzene solution of donor 4CzIPN (50 μM) and acceptor QP (750 μM). The concentration of QP cannot be increased more due to its solubility limit. The mixed solution was prepared in an Ar-filled grove box (O2 concentration <0.1 ppm). The TADF donor 4CzIPN shows the absorption band at 450 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). Significantly, under excitation at 445 nm, the mixed solution of 4CzIPN-QP showed a strong upconverted UV emission below 400 nm (Fig. 2a). The observed photoluminescence peaks at 353, 371, and 390 nm match well with the fluorescence spectrum of QP alone in benzene (Fig. S3, ESI†). The 4CzIPN–QP pair gave a large anti-Stokes shift of 0.73 eV.

(b) PL decay of the deaerated benzene solution of 4CzIPN-QP at 353 nm under pulsed excitation at 445 nm. Single exponential fitting of the tail part (red line) provides the triplet state lifetime of τT = 146 μs. (c) TTA-UC emission intensity for the deaerated benzene solution of 4CzIPN-QP as a function of the excitation intensity. The linear fits with slopes 2 and 1 in the lower and higher excitation intensity regimes are shown. (d) TTA-UC quantum yield of the deaerated benzene solution of 4CzIPN-QP with different excitation light intensities of the 445 nm laser. 
We confirmed the donor-to-acceptor TTET process by measuring the photoluminescence quantum yield of the donor TADF. The TADF emission of the benzene solution of 4CzIPN (50 μM) showed a ΦPL,0 of 82%. This quantum yield decreased to ΦPL = 66% in the presence of QP (750 μM). A sensitization efficiency was obtained as ΦS = 1 − ΦPL/ΦPL,0 = 20%. This ΦS value would be improved by covalently connecting donors and acceptors,7,12,23 and by co-assembly of donors and acceptors at close distances.13–16,26–27
To confirm that the upconverted UV emission originates from the TTA-UC mechanism, we measured the lifetime and excitation intensity dependence of the UC emission. The mixed toluene solution of 4CzIPN-QP showed a μs-scale delayed fluorescence upon pulsed excitation at 445 nm (Fig. 2b). This result supports the fact that the observed UC emission is mediated by the long-lived triplet state. The triplet lifetime τT = 146 μs was obtained from the decay time of the upconverted emission by the known relationship IUC(t) ∝ exp(−t/τUC) = exp(−2t/τT) in the longer timescale region, when the annihilation efficiency becomes negligible compared with the spontaneous decay of the triplets.28 In general, the TTA-UC emission intensity shows a quadratic dependence on the excitation intensity in a weak excitation regime as expected for the bimolecular annihilation process. Meanwhile, by increasing the incident light intensity above the threshold excitation intensity Ith, TTA becomes the main deactivation channel for the acceptor triplet. Consequently, the excitation intensity dependence changes from quadratic to linear at the excitation intensity Ith, above which the upconversion efficiency is maximized.29–31 Such a quadratic-to-linear transition was observed for the mixed solution of 4CzIPN-QP, providing further evidence of a TTA-based UC mechanism (Fig. 2c). The crossing point of the quadratic and linear fitting lines gave a relatively high Ith value of 775 mW cm−2. It has been recently reported that the Ith value can be significantly decreased to a value much lower than that of the solar irradiance by utilizing fast triplet energy migration (TEM) in densely pre-organized chromophores.14,15 The implementation of this TEM-UC approach should also decrease the Ith value of the current UC system based on TADF donors.
The TTA-UC quantum yield was determined relative to a standard, coumarin 6 in benzene. Note that the quantum yield is generally defined as the ratio of emitted photon numbers to absorbed photon numbers, and thus the theoretical maximum of the TTA-UC quantum yield (ΦUC) is 50%.8,32,33 Meanwhile, in many reports this value is multiplied with 2 to set the maximum conversion efficiency as 100%. To avoid confusion between these different definitions, the UC quantum yield is written as ΦUC′ (=2ΦUC) when the maximum efficiency is standardized to be 100%. Fig. 2d shows the dependence of the TTA-UC quantum efficiency ΦUC′ on the excitation power intensity for the mixed solution of 4CzIPN-QP. With an increase in the incident power, the ΦUC′ value increased and reached a maximum at 3.9%. This value is reasonably high for visible-to-UV TTA-UC.17–19 The UC quantum yield ΦUC′ depends on the efficiency of each of the photochemical processes, which are sensitization (ΦS), TTA (ΦTTA), production of S1 after TTA (f) and acceptor fluorescence (ΦFL). ΦTTA represents the ratio of acceptor T1 used for TTA among all the sensitized T1, which can be 1 in the saturated regime.8,33 The absolute fluorescence quantum yield measurement of the QP solution (750 μM in benzene) gave a high ΦFL value of 0.93. Therefore, the ΦUC′ value should be further improved by increasing not only the ΦS value as mentioned above, but also the f value. The f value can be improved by the structural optimization of the acceptor such that the T2 energy level, which is the main deactivation channel, is located higher than twice the T1 energy level.33,34
To highlight the promising potential of TADF materials with very small ΔEST as a TTA-UC donor, we employed the prototypical UV emitter TP with T1 (2.5 eV)25 and S1 (3.6 eV) energy levels which are considerably higher than those reported for visible-light-excited TTA-UC systems. Remarkably, the deaerated benzene solution of 4CzIPN and TP showed a clear upconverted UV emission at 343 nm upon excitation at 445 nm (Fig. 3a, [4CzIPN] = 50 μM, [TP] = 25 mM). The TTA-based mechanism of the observed UC emission was confirmed by the μs-scale lifetime of UC emission and the quadratic-to-linear transition of excitation intensity dependence of the UC emission (Fig. 3b and c). We successfully obtained a relatively high TTA-UC quantum yield of ΦUC′ = 2.8% for this donor–acceptor system (Fig. 3d). The very small ΔEST of the TADF donor allows efficient conversion of visible light to UV light with a large anti-Stokes shift of 0.83 eV. It is worth noting that the upconverted luminescence peak at 343 nm is significantly blue-shifted compared to that of the conventional pyrene acceptors (λem at 377 nm with an anti-Stokes shift of 0.50 eV),19 which clearly demonstrates the importance of combining high-triplet energy acceptors with the TADF donor.

Single exponential fitting of the tail part (red line) provides the triplet state lifetime of τT = 80 μs.

The linear fits with slopes 2 and 1 in the lower and higher excitation intensity regimes are shown.

In conclusion, we show the visible-to-UV photon upconversion with large anti-Stokes shifts of 0.73–0.83 eV by a careful selection of emitters with high triplet and singlet energy levels that utilize the full potential of TADF triplet sensitizer. The triplet energy was effectively transferred from the TADF donor to the acceptors, providing upconverted emission in the UV region. We demonstrate that the small ΔEST of TADF materials solves the problems associated with conventional donors, that is, the reduction of energy gain due to donor ISC as well as the unavailability of acceptor with high T1 (and thus S1) energy. The implementation of TADF donor in the triplet energy migration (TEM-UC) system13–16,26–27 holds promise in the future for realizing TTA-UC with a large anti-Stokes shift under extremely low-power excitation.
