    , Accepted 3rd January 2013First published on 7th January 2013AbstractHierarchically porous polyaniline–reduced graphene oxide hybrids have been developed via oxidative polymerization of aniline by MnO2 on reduced graphene sheets under acidic conditions (named M-PANI@rGO). The formation mechanism of the above hybrids indicates that the MnO2 undergoes oxidative disintegration and results in the porous structure of polyaniline (PANI) nanoparticle formation on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) surface. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) nitrogen sorption–desorption measurement clearly showed the nanoporous nature of the M-PANI@rGO hybrids. TEM-EDX confirmed the complete removal/degradation of MnO2 during the oxidative polymerization of aniline. Just for comparison, PANI–rGO hybrids have also been prepared via conventional polymerization using (NH4)2S2O8 as the oxidant (named C-PANI@rGO). When these different architectural PANI@rGO hybrids were applied as the counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and power-conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSCs with C-PANI@rGO hybrids are measured to be 11.64 mA cm−2 and 5.62%, respectively, while the corresponding values are 12.88 mA cm−2 and 6.15% for the DSSCs with M-PANI@rGO hybrids, which is comparable to 6.73% for the cell with a Pt counter electrode under the same experimental conditions. The hierarchically porous M-PANI@rGO hybrid is thus a promising candidate to replace platinum as a counter electrode for DSSCs.
Introduction
Since initial reports by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered as a credible alternative to conventional silicon solar cells for their easy fabrication, low cost and high energy conversion efficiency.1,2 Typically, standard DSSCs consist of a dye-sensitized mesoporous semiconductor photoanode, an iodide/triiodide redox electrolyte, and a catalytic counter electrode. The counter electrode is an important component of DSSCs, the role of which is to collect electrons from the external circuit and reduce I3− to I− in the electrolyte.3,4 Usually fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass is loaded with platinum to facilitate electron transfer from the external circuit to the I3−/I− redox electrolyte, due to the high catalytic activity and conductivity of platinum. However, platinum is a noble metal and both of the two current methods, sputtering and electrochemical deposition,5,6 used for preparing Pt counter electrodes are highly energy-consuming, which would limit the industrial applications. Therefore, many studies have been devoted to finding new alternative materials with low cost, high electronic conductivity, good chemical stability, and comparable catalytic effects for triiodide reduction to replace platinum as counter electrodes for DSSCs.
Carbon may be a promising candidate due to its abundance and availability, high chemical stability, good electrical conductivity and favorable catalytic efficiency. Consequently, many carbon-based functional materials including carbon black, carbon nanotubes, activated carbon, graphite, and mesoporous carbon have been studied extensively.7–9 Specifically, graphene has attracted tremendous attention in recent years due to its excellent conductivity, large surface area and high mechanical strength.10,11 Unfortunately, graphene does not seem to be the right candidate for a counter electrode in DSSCs, considering the limited number of active sites for I3−/I− electrocatalysis.12 For this reason, conducting polymers, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulphonate) (PEDOT:PSS), polypyrrole (PPY), and polyaniline (PANI), have also been incorporated into graphene as counter electrodes for DSSCs due to their excellent catalytic activities.13–15 It can be envisioned that polymer–graphene hybrids would combine the merits of both excellent conductivities and high catalytic activities. Among them, polyaniline, as an excellent counter electrode material, has been extensively studied based on its desirable features: low cost, environmental stability, and high degree of processability.16–18 Recently the PANI–graphene hybrid synthesized by oxidative polymerization of aniline monomers in a suspension of graphene sheets has been investigated and employed as a counter electrode for DSSCs, which was prepared using (NH4)2S2O8 as the oxidant to polymerize aniline on the graphene surface.15 It was found that graphene sheets furnished the nucleation sites for PANI as well as the commendable bridges for electron transfer, leading to even better properties. On the other hand, the counter electrode materials with a nanoporous structure are beneficial since the connected porous framework can accommodate faster infiltration of electrolyte and notable enhancement of effective catalysis area.4 However, as far as we can tell, the synthesis and application of hierarchically porous polyaniline–graphene hybrids in DSSCs has been rarely reported.
Herein, we report the preparation of hierarchically porous polyaniline–reduced graphene oxide hybrids and their application as a counter electrode for DSSCs. The formation of a hierarchically porous structure was achieved by using ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets as the self-sacrificial template, which also acted as a chemical oxidative initiator for aniline polymerization.19 This effect causes the template to be spontaneously removed after the reaction, because the MnO2 is reduced into soluble Mn2+ ions, whereas the aniline monomer is oxidatively polymerized. Importantly, this aniline polymerization process on the graphene surface could not only render a habitual hybrid structure but also significantly enhances the specific surface area and porosity of the hybrids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of hierarchically porous polyaniline–reduced graphene oxide hybrids as a counter electrode for DSSCs. The energy conversion efficiency of the hybrid prepared using MnO2 as a sacrificial template can reach as high as 6.15% under irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 simulated solar light, which is much higher than the 5.62% of the polyaniline–reduced graphene oxide hybrid prepared using the conventional polymerization procedure. The remarkable electrochemical performance of hierarchically porous hybrids indicate their promising application as counter electrode materials for DSSCs.
Experimental
GO nanosheet preparation
The GO used here was prepared by the modified Hummers method, which has been reported in our previous work.20 Typically, 0.5 g of graphite, 0.25 g of NaNO3 and 11.5 ml of H2SO4 were mixed completely by stirring at 0 °C in an ice-bath in a Teflon container, and then 1.5 g of KMnO4 was added slowly to the mixture and the temperature of the mixture was kept below 20 °C. After stirring for a period of time, the solution temperature was increased to 35 °C with stirring for over 35 min until the solution became a brown paste. 23 ml of distilled water was added slowly and the temperature was raised to 98 °C. After stirring for about 15 min, the solution was diluted to 70 ml and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was added until the solution turned bright yellow. The solution was filtered and the resulting slurry was rinsed with distilled water several times. After ultrasonication at 400 W for 30 min and centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 30 min, the brown GO hydrosol was obtained.
Synthesis of ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets
Ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets were synthesized by the procedure reported in our previous work.21 In short, BaMnO4 (10 mmol) was dissolved in deionized water (90 ml) by continuous magnetic stirring to form a homogeneous solution. Then H2SO4 (2.4 ml, 4.23 M) was injected into the above solution, followed by centrifugation to obtain fresh HMnO4 solution. Meanwhile, ethanol (10 ml) was mixed with deionized water (60 ml), and then block copolymer (11 ml, poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol), Mw = 2900) was added dropwise slowly into the mixture with vigorous stirring to form a clear aqueous solution. After that, the fresh HMnO4 solution was added dropwise to the block copolymer solution mixture using a delivery pump, under continuous magnetic stirring at 10 rpm. After 1 h vacuum degassing, the obtained mixture solution was stirred for a further 12 h to ensure complete reaction of the HMnO4 solution. After the reaction, the black floccus MnO2 nanosheet was filtered, and rinsed with ethanol and deionized water several times in order to remove soluble impurities. The product was dried in an oven at 100 °C overnight.
MnO2@rGO hybrid preparation
The MnO2–rGO hybrids were prepared by a similar method to that demonstrated by Huang et al.22 0.5 g ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets were first dissolved in distilled water, and then 25 ml GO (4 mg ml−1) was transferred from the as-made suspension to the mixed solution by continuously stirring at room temperature to form a homogeneous mixture, followed by evaporation of the solvent at 60 °C on a hotplate. The well-mixed powder was heated in an oven at 350 °C for 3 h to obtain the MnO2@rGO hybrid.
M-PANI@rGO hybrid preparation
The resultant MnO2–rGO powder was transferred to an ice-water bath for 30 min and 0.5 ml aniline (dispersed in 20 ml of 2 M HCl in ice cold distilled water) was added into the above mixture, rapidly. The chemical polymerization of aniline was initiated by MnO2 and the color of the mixture turned to emeraldine from brownish black, which confirms the formation of polyaniline. To ensure complete polymerization of aniline, 0.5 g of (NH4)2S2O8 was also added to the above mixture and stirred for another 6 h. The addition of (NH4)2S2O8 does not have an influence on the final morphology of the M-PANI@rGO hybrid. The product was washed with ethanol followed by distilled water and dried at 60 °C overnight in a vacuum oven.
Counter electrode of DSSC
To obtain M-PANI@rGO paste, 0.25 g of M-PANI@rGO powder and 3 g of H2O (containing 0.01 g sodium carboxymethylcellulose) was transferred into a small beaker, and then stirred for 12 h. The as-prepared paste was coated on FTO-glass by the doctor-blading method. Then the M-PANI@rGO electrode was heated at 80 °C for 60 min after naturally drying. For comparison, a C-PANI@rGO counter electrode was also prepared, which was prepared by a similar method except for using (NH4)2S2O8 as the oxide source. The Pt electrode was prepared by depositing a thin layer of Pt on FTO by magnetron sputtering.
Preparation of DSSCs
TiO2 paste synthesized by a hydrothermal method was doctor-bladed on FTO glass and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the TiO2 photoanode was immersed in a 0.5 mM N3 ethanol solution and heated at 60 °C for 12 hours, then rinsed with ethanol and dried. A liquid electrolyte was prepared by blending 1 M PMII(1-methyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide), 0.04 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M GuSCN(guanidinium thiocyanate), 0.5 M TBP(4-tert-butylpyridine) in acetonitrile, and propylene carbonate (v/v = 1:1) between them. The sandwich-type DSSCs were assembled by dropping a drop of the liquid electrolytes on the dye-sensitized TiO2 film and then the Pt or carbon counter electrode was clipped firmly to the TiO2 photoanode. A mask with a window of 0.25 cm2 was also clipped on the side of the TiO2 to define the active area of the cell.
Characterization
Raman spectra were recorded by a commercial Raman microscope (HR800, Horiba). Scanning electron microscopy, SEM (Sirion FEG) was applied to study the morphology and structure of the as-prepared samples. TEM and HRTEM investigations were carried out using a JEOL 2010, equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) system. Atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements were performed in the tapping mode using a SHIMADZU SPM-9500J3. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of the as-prepared samples were investigated by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) nitrogen sorption–desorption measurements (JW-BK, China). The photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the cells were recorded by applying an external potential bias to the device under AM 1.5 simulated illumination (Newport, 91192) with a power density of 100 mW cm−2, which was calibrated by a Si photodiode, and the active area was controlled by a 0.25 cm2 mask. Cyclic voltammetry was performed on a CHI 660C (Shang Hai, China) electrochemical station with Pt as the auxiliary electrode, a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and Pt/FTO or PANI@rGO/FTO as the working electrode in an acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were also performed on a CHI 660C with the frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz under the open-circuit voltage in the illumination.
Results and discussion
The GO and MnO2 nanosheet solutions were employed to fabricate the M-PANI@rGO hybrid using the layer-by-layer self-assembly method as illustrated in Scheme 1. As shown in Scheme 1, an ultrathin MnO2 nanosheet will form a composite with GO due to the electrostatic forces between the O atoms of the negatively charged oxygen-containing functional groups on the GO sheets and Mn.23 In the first step, the GO–MnO2 composite was prepared by mixing an appropriate amount of MnO2 nanosheets and GO nanosheets. Then, an appropriate amount of aniline was added to the above composite and the chemical oxidation polymerization was initiated by reduction of the Mn4+ ion and the resulting Mn2+ ions will go into the solution. The half reaction of manganese oxide under acidic conditions is:MnO2 + 4H+ + 2e− → Mn2+ + 2H2O

This process could not only render a habitual hybrid structure but also significantly enhances the porosity of the hybrids, which enables better percolation of the electrolyte to access a large surface area.

Fig. 1 shows the Raman spectra of MnO2@rGO and the obtained M-PANI@rGO hybrids. For MnO2@rGO hybrids, the characteristic peaks centered at around 1347 and 1578 cm−1 can be ascribed to the D and G bands of rGO, respectively.24 And we could observe that a new characteristic peak of MnO2 located at 643 cm−1 appeared,25 which suggests the successful addition of MnO2 on the surface of the reduced graphene oxide sheets. In comparison with that of MnO2@rGO, besides the characteristic peaks of reduced graphene oxide (D band and G band), a new shoulder peak located at 1160 cm−1 could be observed, which might be attributed to the C–H bending of the quinoid ring.26 Furthermore, the peak of the G band widened and enhanced, this might be due to the existence of a characteristic peak of PANI located at 1594 cm−1, which could demonstrate the effective incorporation of PANI by layer-by-layer assembly using MnO2 as a sacrifice template.26

The morphologies of pristine GO, MnO2 and MnO2@GO hybrid nanosheets have been examined by FE-TEM and FE-SEM (Fig. 2). As seen in Fig. 2a and b, the GO sheets stacked together and formed a very flat thin layer. Furthermore, the edges of many sheets slightly curved (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b displays that the MnO2 precursors consist of flower-like agglomerates made of inter-tangled ultrathin nanosheets with dimensions ranging from 100 nm to 200 nm in edge length. The layer-by-layer morphology of MnO2@rGO hybrids can be clearly observed in Fig. 2c and Fig. S1,† showing that uniform decoration of MnO2 on the surface of the reduced graphene oxide sheets had been achieved during the process of layer-by-layer self-assembly between electrostatic forces. Further energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) results confirm the presence of both Mn and C elements in the MnO2@rGO hybrid nanosheets (Fig. 2d).

Fig. 3 exhibits the SEM and TEM images of the as-synthesized products. The FE-SEM images of M-PANI@rGO hybrids shows an agglomerated particle-like morphology at a lower magnification (Fig. 3a) and the layer-by-layer nanostructure could be seen at the higher magnification (Fig. 3b and Fig. S2†). Similar layer-by-layer morphologies between the MnO2@rGO precursor and the final product (M-PANI@rGO) confirm an in situ conversion during the polymerization process. The M-PANI@rGO hybrid was also characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 3c shows typical TEM images of hierarchically porous hybrids of uniform polyaniline nanoparticles decorating the surface of the reduced graphene oxide sheet, which could offer high porosity to the M-PANI@rGO hybrid electrodes that enables the electrolytes to access the large surface area of graphene.27 The complete removal of MnO2 in M-PANI@rGO hybrids could be verified by EDX (Fig. 3d), where the disappearance of the characteristic peaks of Mn suggested that MnO2 and Mn ions had been removed from the M-PANI@rGO.

To validate the hierarchically porous nature of the M-PANI@rGO hybrid, atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements and pore size distribution analysis were carried out for the M-PANI@rGO and C-PANI@rGO samples. The hierarchical morphology of M-PANI@rGO hybrid was examined by AFM (Fig. 4a), which confirms that the dried dispersions of M-PANI@rGO are formed by layer-by-layer self-assembly. The M-PANI@rGO have lateral dimensions of several micrometers and an average interlayer spacing of 4.9 nm, which coincides well with the results of the BET analysis. As seen in Fig. 4b, the pore size distribution profile exhibits the porous nature of the M-PANI@rGO sample with a pore size of 3.9 and 8.0 nm, and the high surface area of 68 m2 g−1, whereas the latter sample does not show any porous nature and a low surface area of 26 m2 g−1. The porous structure of M-PANI@rGO hybrids could be attributed to not only the layer-by-layer stacking of PANI particles and reduced graphene oxide sheets, but also the porous nature of the PANI nanoparticles on the reduced graphene oxide surface, which is due to the chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline by MnO2 releasing the Mn2+ ions slowly into the solution.27

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs fabricated with Pt, M-PANI@rGO and C-PANI@rGO counter electrodes are presented in Fig. 5. All the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The DSSCs based on the M-PANI@rGO hybrid counter electrode exhibited a conversion efficiency (η) of 6.15% which was comparable to the Pt counter electrode with a η of 6.73%, whereas the DSSCs based on the C-PANI@rGO hybrid counter electrode showed a η of 5.62%. The DSSCs employing the M-PANI@rGO counter electrode give a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.88 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.65. The parameters of a device employing a C-PANI@rGO counter electrode were 11.64 mA cm−2, 0.74 V and 0.65, respectively. It should be noted that the performance of the device employing an M-PANI@rGO counter electrode is much better than that of the device employing a C-PANI@rGO counter electrode. Such enhancements can be ascribed to the larger specific surface area and hierarchically porous nature of the M-PANI@rGO hybrid, which can not only provide larger surface area for the reduction of I3− ions but also enable better percolation of the electrolyte to access a large surface area. Besides, the Jsc, Voc and FF of the device employing a Pt counter electrode were 12.59 mA cm−2, 0.74 V and 0.72, respectively. The DSSC assembled with a sputtered Pt CE showed the highest fill factor (FF) among all DSSCs. This is due to the lower interfacial resistance between the Pt CE and the electrolyte accomplished by the dense and compact surface morphology of the Pt film.28 The DSSCs employing a M-PANI@rGO CE achieved a slightly higher Jsc than the DSSC fabricated using a Pt CE. This also can be attributed to the hierarchically porous structure, which provides larger active surface areas for the I3− reduction. Although the DSSC assembled with a M-PANI@rGO CE had a lower FF, it achieved a higher Jsc, which resulted in a comparable performance to a DSSC using a Pt CE.

Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate and compare the electrocatalytic activity of the different counter electrodes toward the I−/I3− redox couple with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 6, the CEs based on the PANI@rGO hybrids and Pt showed very similar shapes in terms of redox peak positions and current densities. Two pairs of redox peaks were observed on all counter electrodes; the left and the right pairs were attributed to the oxidation and reduction of I−/I3− and I2/I3−, respectively.29 As we all know, the counter electrode in a DSSC serves to catalyze the reduction of I3− to I−, thus the characteristics of the left pair of peaks were of research interest. The magnitude of the current density at such a peak is directly proportional to the ability of the electrode to reduce the I3− species.3,30 It is conspicuously larger for the M-PANI@rGO hybrid electrode compared to that of the C-PANI@rGO electrode and sputtered Pt electrode, suggesting the superior catalytic activity of M-PANI@rGO counter electrodes in DSSCs. The above result should be attributed to the accessible porosity for I− and I3− ions in the M-PANI@rGO counter electrode and the large electrochemical active surface area for I3− ion reduction. Based on these merits, the Jsc of the device based on an M-PANI@rGO electrode was much higher than that of devices based on a C-PANI@rGO electrode and even slightly higher than that of a Pt electrode.

In order to further clarify the correlations between the electrocatalytic properties of the counter electrodes and the J–V performance of the devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed and the results are shown in Fig. 7. Two semicircles are observed in the measured frequency range 10−1 to 105 Hz for all devices in the Nyquist plots. It is well known that the charge transfer resistance (Rct1) at the counter electrode–electrolyte interface represents the intrinsic catalytic properties of the counter electrode for I3− reduction.31 After fitting the experimental data with the inset equivalent circuit, Rct1 at the counter electrode–electrolyte interface was obtained (Table 1). As expected, Rct1 of the M-PANI@rGO electrode (1.17 Ω) was found to be similar to that of the C-PANI@rGO electrode (1.36 Ω), and Rct1 of the Pt electrode (0.83 Ω) was much lower than that of the PANI@rGO hybrid based electrodes. This indicates that the intrinsic catalytic activity of Pt is better than PANI@rGO hybrids. Furthermore, the internal series resistance (Rs) of DSSCs can be obtained from EIS spectra (Table 1). Rs is composed of the electrolyte resistance and the sheet resistance of the electrode.32,33 Notably, Rs of the device based on the Pt counter electrode was lower than that of the device based on a PANI@rGO counter electrode, and this was due to the lower Rct1 and sheet resistance of the Pt electrode compared with the PANI@rGO-based counter electrode. As a result, the fill factor (FF) of the device employing a Pt electrode was higher than that of a device employing the PANI@rGO-based electrode. However, it was encouraging that the high electrochemical active surface area and the favorable accessible porosity of the M-PANI@rGO electrode made up for the relatively poor intrinsic catalytic activity, so the M-PANI@rGO electrode revealed an excellent catalytic performance overall. As a result, the Jsc of the device based on the M-PANI@rGO counter electrode was much higher than that of the device based on the C-PANI@rGO counter electrode and even slightly higher than the device based on the Pt counter electrode. The overall conversion efficiency of the device based on the M-PANI@rGO counter electrode was comparable with that of DSSCs based on the Pt counter electrode.

Conclusions
In summary, a hierarchically porous M-PANI@rGO hybrid synthesized by layer-by-layer self-assembly using MnO2 as the self-sacrificial template and a chemical oxidative initiator for aniline polymerization was prepared as a counter electrode for DSSCs. This M-PANI@rGO hybrid electrode was found to have the advantages of a high electrochemically active surface area, accessible porosity and high catalytic activity toward the reduction of I3− to I−. Finally, DSSCs employing this M-PANI@rGO hybrid counter electrode achieved a conversion efficiency as high as 6.15% which was comparable to that of the device employing the Pt counter electrode. Therefore, this M-PANI@rGO hybrid electrode could be an ideal counter electrode candidate for applications in DSSCs.
