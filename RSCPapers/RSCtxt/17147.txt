    , Accepted 11th June 2013First published on 17th June 2013AbstractA surface-blocking triphenylamine-based organic dye (named as D35) is utilized for the fabrication of efficient dye solar cells (DSCs) employing solvent-free ionic liquid electrolytes. The prepared DSCs present power conversion efficiencies of 5.2% under 1 sun AM 1.5G illumination conditions, a performance very similar to solar cells using a reference electrolyte with identical amount (0.2 M) of iodine dissolved in a standard acetonitrile–valeronitrile solvent mixture. Despite the high concentration of recombining species inside the electrolyte, the IL-based cells are able to afford a photopotential (Voc) of 0.76 V. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) has explored the recombination dynamics and conduction band edge shifts, proving the role of the dye's molecular structure on attaining such a high value of Voc. The obtained short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) values are discussed and justified in terms of mass-transport limitation processes in the viscous ionic liquid electrolyte.
Introduction
Metal-free organic dyes have attracted great interest in recent years in order to effectively replace expensive and tricky to synthesize and purify ruthenium metal complexes for highly-efficient dye solar cells (DSCs).1 Their impact was more pronounced in the case of DSCs fabricated using slow conductors, solid-state hole-transport materials2 or ionic electrolytes,3 where mass-transfer limitations occur and consequently recombination is promoted. The above systems are employed in order to overcome long-term stability issues of DSCs incorporating a volatile liquid electrolyte based on the corrosive I−/I3− redox shuttle.4
A characteristic example of the latest category is the DSC based on redox electrolytes dissolved in thermally, chemically and electrochemically stable ionic liquids (ILs), in lieu of conventional organic solvents. The main disadvantage of ILs is their usually lower performance in devices because of their high viscosity, which results in slow diffusion of I− and I3− ions. To overcome this problem, a thin TiO2 film is necessary and thus a sensitizer with high absorptivities, such as metal-free organic dyes, should be always accompanied.5
Highly efficient organic dyes typically comprise of a donor part (D) and an acceptor counterpart (A) bridged by a π-conjugated linkage.6 As a donor, triphenylamine (TPA) has shown promising applications in the development of photovoltaic devices due to its excellent electron-donating nature and non-planar configuration,7 whereas the cyanoacrylic acid moiety is one of the most used units as an electron acceptor/anchoring group.8 A paramount paradigm of such a molecular structure is a D-π-A dye, D35, where the bridge between the donor and the acceptor is the electron-withdrawing thiophene, and TPA is endowed with bulky di-butoxyphenyls (Fig. 1).9
 Fig. 1  Molecular structure of the D35 dye utilized in the present study. 
This dye has unique properties, such as the production of an appreciable short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) due to its extremely high absorption extinction coefficients (ε) in the visible spectrum, being more than 31800 M−1 cm−1 at 442 nm (while the standard Z907 ruthenium sensitizer has an ε of 12000 M−1 cm−1 at 521 nm).10 More importantly, the D35 dye also produces a very large open-circuit photopotential (Voc) and this characteristic was ascribed to the insulating properties of the butoxy chains through steric hindrance.11 However, we should not also exclude the possibility that a large Voc can originate, in part, from an important TiO2 conduction band shift upon contact with the D-π-A dye; the organic molecule aligns in such a way that its strong dipole moment points away from the surface.12 This probable upward shift is favorable for a Voc increase without concomitantly suppressing electron injection. We should note here that D35 has a significantly high position of the excited state (the energy of the D35 dye's excited state lies at about −1.4 V vs. NHE9a while common ruthenium dyes have an equivalent potential of less than −1.0 V vs. NHE13).
Under all circumstances, high photovoltage values were attained using D35 dye, independently of the type of junction involved (solid state or liquid). For instance, a Voc of 0.78 V was obtained with the use of an I−/I3− redox shuttle dissolved in acetonitrile,9b while much larger photopotentials (of the order of 0.86 up to 0.88 V) were achieved in solid state-DSCs.14 A real breakthrough came with the use of a standard cobalt(II/III) tris(2,2′-bipyridine) redox couple, when a very large photopotential of 0.92 V was obtained.11
Taking advantage of the exceptional properties of the D35 dye, we considered using this highly absorbing sensitizer in DSCs employing solvent-free electrolytes, where the I−/I3− redox mediator is dissolved in ionic liquids. ILs need a high concentration of iodine (usually 0.2 M, which is more than 6 times higher than the standard formulation of a highly efficient electrolyte in acetonitrile),1b,5 in order to effectively carry the charges between the electrodes with minimum ohmic drop. The presence of a high concentration of triiodides or iodine molecules15 would promote the recombination of electrons and thus be detrimental for the obtained photopotential of the cell; a dye, such as D35, would be the ideal solution for this case. As a model electrolyte, the I−/I3− redox couple was dissolved in a classical mixture of ionic liquids, being a blend of 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII) with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide (EMiDCA).16 To get a better idea about the operation of the new device, direct comparison between the IL-based DSCs and solar cells based on a standard electrolyte (in an acetonitrile–valeronitrile solvent mixture having the same concentration of iodine) takes place. The DSCs are thoroughly characterized in terms of their electrical properties; special emphasis is given to explore the recombination dynamics and identify possible conduction band edge shifts in order to shed light on the exact role of the D35 dye on the preservation of the high Voc attained, despite the presence of numerous recombining species in the electrolyte.
Experimental
Materials
Unless otherwise stated, all reagents and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Anhydrous LiI and resublimed I2 were obtained from Merck. DMII and EMiDCA ionic liquids were purchased from Iolitec. Transparent fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass substrates were obtained from Pilkington. The D35 organic dye and standard Z907 Ru2+-based dye17 were purchased from Dyenamo AB (Sweden) and Dyesol UK, respectively. The DSL18NR-T TiO2-based paste (average particle size: 20 nm) and larger diffusing particle-based paste (WER2-O, average particle size: 150–250 nm) were purchased from Dyesol UK. TiCl4 was bought from Fluka.
Dye-sensitized electrode preparation
Titania films were prepared using the doctor-blade technique by depositing one semi-transparent active layer (about 7 μm, measured with an AMBIOS XP-2 profilometer) of the DSL18NR-T paste onto a pre-cleaned FTO conductive glass (Pilkington Solar, 3.2 mm thickness). The films were then dried at 125 °C for 6 min. A second layer (about 5 μm) was deposited on top by doctor-blading the WER2-O paste (previously mixed with DSL18NR-T paste in order to improve the adherence of the overlayer). Next, the films were gradually annealed at 125 °C (5 min), 325 °C (15 min) and then at 525 °C for 30 min. The double layered films were post-treated at 70 °C for 60 min with an aqueous solution of 0.04 M TiCl4, then were thoroughly cleaned with water and ethanol and re-annealed at 450 °C for 1 h. The thermally-treated titania films were sensitized by immersion in a 0.2 mM D35 dye solution in absolute ethanol (or in 0.3 mM Z907 dye in acetonitrile–tert-butanol) for 16–17 h.
Electrolyte preparation and device assembly
An ionic liquid based electrolyte (herein referred to as IL) consisting of 0.1 M LiI and 0.2 M I2 was prepared by dissolving the redox couple in a blend of DMII–EMiDCA in a 13:7 v/v ratio. 0.4 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine (4-TBP) was also added in the final mixture. Two reference liquid electrolytes were also fabricated (1.0 M DMII, 0.05 M LiI, 0.5 M 4-TBP and 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate dissolved in 85:15 v/v acetonitrile–valeronitrile mixture) with 0.015 M (denoted as liquid A) and 0.2 M I2 (denoted as liquid B), respectively.
In order to evaluate their photovoltaic performance, the dye-sensitized films were incorporated as the active photoelectrode (PE) in a lamellar solar cell configuration of the following structure: conductive glass-TiO2 + dye-electrolyte-Pt-conductive glass. 3.2 mm thick TEC8 conductive glasses (Pilkington), platinized by sputtering (resulting in a thickness for the Pt layer of about 100 nm), were used as counter electrodes (CE). Non-sealed DSCs were fabricated by placing a drop of the electrolyte onto the photoelectrode and sandwiching the CE on top of the PE.
Solar cells characterization
Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements were performed using linear sweep voltammetry on an Autolab potentiostat (Ecochemie) working in a 2-electrode mode at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. J–V curves were recorded under dark and under 1 sun (1000 W m−2) solar simulated light from a 300 W-Xe source (Oriel) in combination with an AM 1.5G optical filter, and under different levels of illumination using a Xe lamp in conjunction with various neutral density optical filters (Oriel). The illumination source was calibrated by a KG5 filter-capped Si reference cell (OptoPolymer, Germany), previously calibrated at Fraunhofer ISECalLab PV Cells (calibration mark: 3002766OPT510). The photoelectrode area of the DSCs was 0.25 cm2 while, during measurement, a large black mask (with an aperture area of 0.15 cm2) was used in front of the cells to avoid illuminating the region beyond the active cell area. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed under dark in the potential window of −0.5 V to −0.95 V.
Results and discussion

J–V curves
The photovoltaic performance of DSCs employing various types of electrolytes was initially studied. A batch of about 3 cells was tested for each electrolyte with a small deviation in the attained performance (below the best cells are presented). The J–V curves, obtained under standard 1 sun AM 1.5G illumination, are depicted in Fig. 2a, while Tables 1–2 summarize the cell performance and corresponding parameters derived from the J–V curves.
 Fig. 2  Current density–voltage characteristics of the DSCs based on the ionic liquid (IL) and liquid B electrolytes, under 1 sun AM 1.5G illumination (a) and in the dark (b). 
The ionic liquid electrolyte using the D35 dye attained an overall power conversion efficiency (η) of 5.2%, while the liquid B electrolyte presented a slightly higher performance of 5.8%, mainly due to the higher photocurrent values. It is very important that the DSCs based on the IL electrolyte could afford almost 90% of the efficiency gained by a liquid electrolyte containing an identical concentration of iodine. Additionally, we should mention that this efficiency is among the highest in the related literature reporting the usage of triphenylamine-based dyes in conjunction with ionic liquid electrolytes.18 A clearly greater efficiency (8.4%) was only attained by the group of Prof. P. Wang employing the so-called C218 dye;19 however, the above dye absorbs light much deeper in the visible spectrum (ε = 56000 M−1 cm−1 at 552 nm)20 in comparison with the “orange” D35 dye.
In order to have a fair comparison of our results, we fabricated various reference cells with standard liquid electrolytes and dyes (see Table 1). D35 dye presented a maximum efficiency of 6.4% with an optimum liquid A (a value very close to that obtained by the group of Hagfeldt and Sun et al. who synthesized the dye),14a together with a Voc as high as 0.79 V. We should emphasize here that the addition of excess iodine (more than 10 times) into liquid A electrolyte decreased the Voc down to 0.74 V (see the results for liquid B in Table 1). Contrarily, the IL electrolyte, containing the same iodine as liquid B, still produces a Voc of 0.76 V. The above tendency was further confirmed by employing a slightly different photoelectrode (a more porous scattering layer was utilized in lieu of the WER2-O overlayer) which, quite notably, also gave an even higher efficiency of 5.5% (data not shown). Here, we should highlight the fact that we did not employ any blocking compact layers, which are commonly used to reduce recombination of the exposed FTO substrate.1b On the other hand, the corresponding cells using the ruthenium Z907 dye gave lower photopotentials, fully justifying the need of an “insulating” dye in IL-based DSCs, even though the efficiencies were slightly higher for the IL electrolyte (5.8%) and significantly higher for the liquid A electrolyte. This particular hydrophobic dye was chosen as a reference as it gives an excellent performance in conjunction with IL-electrolytes5a and it currently holds the record of 8.3% efficiency in our lab.

The following investigations further focus on the behaviour of the D35-based cells employing redox electrolytes with the same amount of iodine (IL or pure liquid B). The corresponding J–V curves under dark (Fig. 2b) proved that both cells had a similar onset of the cathodic current at around −0.6 V, while significant differences were observed on the relative magnitude of the dark current, especially at highly negative potentials approaching −1.0 V. The IL-based cell produced one third of the dark current delivered by the liquid B-cell. Additionally, a significant shift of the dark current curve towards negative potentials took place for the IL electrolyte in comparison with the liquid electrolyte. Both features are a first indication that the D35 dye can afford a high Voc in ionic liquid electrolyte-based solar cells. The origin of this behaviour could be twofold; either the recombination rate decreases or a negative shift of the TiO2 conduction band energy level takes place (or even both). These issues will be further explained in the following sections.
Incident light intensity dependence
Comparing the IL and liquid B-based cells, we saw that the clear limitation for the efficiency of the IL-cell was the obtained photocurrent, being 87% of the Jsc attained by the liquid B-cell. This relatively small loss of photocurrent could be attributed to the more viscous environment through which the ions have to diffuse between the two electrodes. IL-electrolytes usually have a viscosity of over 40 cP at 25 °C,21 while acetonitrile-based electrolytes present approximately 40 times lower viscosity (1 cP at room temperture).22 To examine whether mass transport is indeed limiting the current in the IL-based DSC, the J–V curves were recorded under different levels of illumination and the results are included in Table 2. To further explore the above issue, the Jsc of both cells was drawn against the incident light power density (Pin) (Fig. 3a). Linearity between Jsc and Pin23 is typically preserved for liquid B electrolyte.24 In the case of the IL-based cell, a very small deviation from linearity is observed (small decrease of the actual slope in comparison with the estimated ideal), in agreement with the literature.25 This slight deviation from linearity could account for the small photocurrent limitation under strong light illumination. This is further supported by the fact that the IL-cell produced an identical efficiency of 5% under 0.1 sun AM 1.5G illumination when compared with the liquid B-DSC (Table 2).

 Fig. 3  (a) Short-circuit photocurrent density plotted against the light power density (Pin) and (b) a similar plot of Voc against Jsc in a semilogarithmic scale of DSCs based on the IL and liquid B electrolytes. The black dotted line, representing the ideal linear behaviour for the IL curve, only serves as a guide to the eye. 
Then, the semilogarithmic plots of Voc against Jsc (which scales almost linearly with Pin) (Fig. 3b) were plotted, following the well-known equation describing the dependence of voltage to the short-circuit photocurrent for a non-ideal diode:26 (1)where m is the ideality factor (a number between 1 and 2), kT/q is the thermal voltage being 25.85 mV27 (q is the electric charge, k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature) and J0 is the dark saturation current. Evidently, the open-circuit photovoltage depends linearly on the logarithm of Jsc and the estimated slopes were found to be 72 and 75 mV per decade for the IL- and liquid B-DSCs, respectively, which are slightly higher than the ideal slope of 59 mV per decade.28 Accordingly, the ideality diode factors (m) were determined to be 1.27 and 1.22, while the order of the recombination reaction (β), estimated as the inverse of m,29 was found to be 0.79 and 0.81 for the IL and liquid B-based solar cells, respectively. These values are in excellent agreement with the m values estimated for similar liquid electrolytes containing 0.05–0.1 M LiI.30 The origin of a marginal deviation from ideality has been frequently assigned to recombination through surface states31 or through the exposed FTO substrate.32 The latter is the most probable cause of recombination in our case, since no blocking layers onto FTO back-contact were employed. In any case, the differences between the values of m for both cells are minor and cannot account for any variations in the electrical performance. Identical fill factor values (FF, which is 0.73 under 1 sun) further confirm the above assumption. The FF describes the quality of the diode behaviour of the solar cell and a good rectifying device with an ideality diode factor close to 1 is anticipated to show an appreciable FF.33
Electron dynamics
Despite the relatively low efficiency of the IL-based cell under 1 sun illumination with respect to that attained by the liquid B-based cell, the most paramount feature of our work was the ability of the IL-DSC to sustain a large photopotential (0.76 V) albeit the presence of a high concentration of recombining species. This result was also supported by dark current measurements (Fig. 2b). To further explore the origin of this phenomenon, recombination dynamics, conduction band edge shifts, voltage drops through ohmic resistances or losses at the interfaces etc., should be examined and adequately analyzed. EIS34 is the ideal method to fully accomplish this.
The spectra (not shown) typically exhibited three prominent semicircles, presenting the classical behaviour previously perceived for similar solar cells.35 The equivalent circuit used to fit the spectra at potentials near Voc, where TiO2 is sufficiently conductive and transport resistance is negligible, was a simplified form of the transmission line model proposed.36 Specifically, it consisted of a contact resistance Rcon (attributed to the FTO substrate, wires and contacts overall ohmic resistance) in series with two RC circuits representing the Pt–electrolyte and TiO2–electrolyte interfaces, respectively, and a finite Warburg impedance representing ionic diffusion in the electrolyte. A more accurate fitting was obtained by employing a constant phase element (CPE) instead of simple capacitance (C).37
Firstly, we focused on the ohmic or pseudo-ohmic resistances of the cells, depicted in Fig. 4a. Similar values for Rcon and RPt–el (being the resistance at the Pt–electrolyte interface) were estimated through fitting for both DSCs (11–12 Ohm and 2 Ohm, respectively), in agreement with the identical values of attained FF. Significant differences were observed in the case of the diffusion resistance (Rd). A much larger Rd (24 Ohm at 0.75 V, in good agreement with Rd values reported for similar ionic liquid electrolytes38) was determined for the IL-cell in comparison with that estimated for the liquid B-cell (about 3 Ohm) consistent with the different viscosities of the two electrolytes. The relatively large change of Rd with potential39 for IL-cell could be assigned to the relatively inefficient charge transport by the carrying ions.
 Fig. 4  (a) Diffusion resistance (Rd), contact resistance (Rcon) and resistance at the Pt–electrolyte interface (RPt–el) are plotted against the applied potential (closed symbols refer to the IL electrolyte, while open symbols concern the liquid B solar cell). (b) Chemical capacitance (Cμ) of the TiO2 semiconductor plotted against the actual potential of the photoelectrode VF. (c) Recombination resistance (Rrec) plotted against the voltage at the equivalent band position, Vecb, and (d) J–V characteristics under 1 sun AM 1.5G illumination re-plotted by replacing Vappl with Vecb. See the text for details. 
Then, we focused on the TiO2–electrolyte interface and determined fitting values for the charge recombination resistance (Rrec), as well as for the chemical capacitance (Cμ) that stands for the change of the electron density as a function of the Fermi level.39 A plot of the chemical capacitance is given in Fig. 4b against the actual voltage drop in the photoelectrode (denoted as VF). VF is estimated as: VF = Vappl − Vseries(2)where VF is the corrected voltage, Vappl is the applied voltage and Vseries is the voltage drop at the total series resistance, Rseries,38 which is given by: Rseries = Rcon + RPt–el + Rd(3)
The voltage drop (Vseries) was estimated by multiplying Rseries by the dark current density (Jdark). Jdark was taken by J–V measurements in the dark (Fig. 2b). We should note here that the estimated voltage drop was identical for both cells (about 16 mV) close to open-circuit, ruling out the possibility, at least partially, to explain the observed Voc differences.
The chemical capacitance showed, as expected, an exponential behaviour confirming the exponential trap energy distribution below the conduction band edge,40 according to: (4)where T0 stands for a parameter with temperature units determining the depth of the trap distribution tail under the conduction band and C0 is a parameter given by: (5)where p and L are the porosity and thickness of the TiO2 film, respectively, NL stands for the total electron trap density,43 and EF0 − Ec is the difference between the dark Fermi level and the conduction band position.39,40
Considering that both cells have identical trap distributions (since they use the same TiO2 working electrode) and assuming that the electrochemical potential of the two electrolytes should be quite similar (using the Nernst equation), the observed shifts could be attributed to shifts in the conduction band edge.41 A small Ec shift of 38 mV towards higher potentials was observed for the IL-DSC, in excellent agreement with other studies already reporting a similar shift between a liquid and an ionic liquid electrolyte.38,42 The origin of this shift is not evident at the moment, however, we postulate that the slow transport of ions present in the IL electrolyte may provoke a local over-concentration of triiodides at the photoelectrode, thus charging negatively the TiO2 surface. We should highlight the fact that this upward shift is the result of the combination of D35, a dye with a large dipole moment, and the IL electrolyte, which has a strong ionic character.
To explore the actual recombination dynamics for the cells independently to different conduction band edge positions, we should take into account the above Ec shift. To accomplish this, we did not plot Rrec against VF, but against the common equivalent conduction band potential (Vecb) which was estimated by adding the above Ec shift to VF (the energy of the conduction band edge for the liquid B-DSC was taken as a reference).34a Thereby, it was then evidenced by Fig. 4c that the recombination was suppressed in the IL-DSC in comparison with the liquid B-solar cell although both electrolytes contained identical concentration of recombining species. This direct evidence clearly proves the blocking character of the D35 dye when used in combination with an ionic liquid electrolyte. To accurately ascribe the real Voc differences, we further re-plotted the J–V curves by taking into account the voltage drops, Vseries, as well as the Ec shifts. In this manner, we plotted J against Vecb and not Vappl (Fig. 4d). A 50 mV difference was then observed between the two cells (0.78 V and 0.73 V for the IL and liquid B solar cells, respectively). Thus, we concluded that the 38 mV of the above difference is associated with the Ec shift and the rest 12 mV is due to the recombination reduction. The D35 dye seems ideal for an ionic liquid-based solar cell since it not only shifts the Ec towards higher potentials, but also acts as an insulating layer on the TiO2 surface, protecting the semiconductor from losing its electrons.
Conclusions
A purely organic, triphenylamine-based dye (namely D35 dye),9a that has previously shown excellent photovoltaic properties in solar cells containing slow conductors such as a Co(II)/Co(III)-based electrolyte11 or an organic hole transport material,14 was employed for the first time in ionic liquid electrolyte-based DSCs using the classical I−/I3− redox mediator. Taking advantage of the extremely high absorption extinction coefficients of the dye,9a the IL-DSC was able to deliver a significant photocurrent of more than 9 mA cm−2, which is 87% of that attained by a conventional liquid electrolyte-based DSC containing the same amount of recombining species (0.2 M I2). The slightly lower Jsc was due to diffusion limitations, especially under conditions of strong light illumination. The most paramount issue of our concept was the preservation of a high photovoltage (0.76 V), despite the absence of a blocking layer between FTO and TiO2, as well as the high amount of recombining species present at the TiO2–electrolyte interface, even higher than that attained by the liquid-cell. This Voc increase was directly correlated with the dye's properties and was attributed to two different reasons: (a) a shift of Ec towards higher potentials produced by the combination of a dye with large dipole moment along with an electrolyte with strong ionic character; accordingly, the high energy position of the excited-state of the dye assures no reduction in the injection of electrons into a semiconductor with high Ec. (b) A reduction of recombination when employing an ionic liquid electrolyte au lieu of a purely liquid one; the bulky ligands endowed on the dyes' molecular structure promise the creation of a perfect insulating monolayer on top of the TiO2 surface. Work is now in progress to optimize the I2 content (from 0.2 up to 1 M) in order to diminish the viscosity, and thus increase the conductivity of our IL electrolyte,44 without sacrificing effective electrons from the semiconductor, as well as to examine the long-term stability45 of the IL-based DSCs.
