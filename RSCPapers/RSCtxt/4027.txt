    , Accepted 3rd January 2023First published on 4th January 2023AbstractEstablishing an efficient and cost-effective hydrogen production system is an important part of facilitating the energy mix transition. By replacing the kinetically slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the thermodynamically advantageous sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR), a hybrid water electrolysis system combining the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and SOR is constructed to reduce the total energy consumption of hydrogen production, while achieving electrochemical conversion of high concentration Na2S solution to sulfur at the anode and producing high purity hydrogen at the cathode. However, due to the toxic and corrosive effects of sulfion, it is still a challenge to construct catalysts that can catalyze efficiently and stably in high-concentration Na2S solution. To this end, the precursor material CuCoO nanosheets on carbon cloth (CuCoO/CC) was nitrided and vulcanized to produce CuCoN/CC and CuCoS/CC for the HER and SOR, respectively. The hybrid water electrolysis system required only 0.75 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm−2 and to maintain the electrocatalytic stability for 144 h. In addition, the Faraday efficiency of both the cathode and anode is close to 100%. This research establishes an energy-saving hybrid water electrolysis system for hydrogen production and provides an effective solution for treating toxic waste.
Introduction
As the most desirable clean energy source, hydrogen has the advantages of high calorific value, non-pollution, and repeatability.1–5 Compared with hydrogen produced by fossil fuel cracking, the electrolytic hydrogen production process using renewable energy sources such as solar or wind energy can achieve zero carbon emissions and is gaining widespread attention.6–10 However, due to the thermodynamic drawback of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the cell voltage of electrolytic water usually exceeds 1.8 V, and most of the electrical energy is converted into oxygen with low commercial value through the anode reaction.11–13 For this reason, some recent studies have attempted to replace the OER with thermodynamically favorable anodic small molecule oxidation reactions,14–17 such as ethylene glycol oxidation,18 glycerol oxidation,19,20 and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation.21–23 This hybrid water electrolysis system reduces the total energy consumption for efficient hydrogen production while gaining value-added products at the anode.24,25 However, most of the above small molecule oxidation reactions involve multi-step oxidation processes, which are complex and have many kinds of products. Therefore, the implementation of hybrid water electrolysis systems for H2 production remains a challenge.
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a common toxic pollutant waste in the petrochemical industry, which is often removed by the Claus process under high-temperature conditions.26,27 In contrast, electrolysis is a viable method for the rapid degradation of this toxic substance into value-added sulfur without the use of additional oxidants or complex separations. Specifically, the electrocatalytic sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) is a process that utilizes electrical energy to convert sulfion into sulfur under ambient conditions.28 Compared to the OER, the SOR possesses a very low oxidation potential (S2− → S + 2e−, Eθ = −0.48 V vs. SHE).29 When the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is combined with the SOR, the cell voltage drops significantly. At the same time, hydrogen is produced at the cathode while sulfion is electrochemically removed and resource utilized at the anode for sulfur recovery. Therefore, the establishment of a hybrid water electrolysis system combining the HER and SOR has strong economic and environmental benefits.
Noteworthily, sulfur ions tend to corrode or poison the bare metal, reducing the activity and stability of the electrocatalyst during the reaction. To this end, Bao et al. reported nitrogen-doped graphene encapsulating a CoNi nanoalloy (CoNi@NGs) and they concluded that the structure of metal nanoparticles encapsulated by nitrogen-doped graphene could protect the catalyst from harsh environments and thus prevent the toxic deactivation of the catalyst.30 However, more research has focused on the construction of transition metal sulfides (e.g., WS2,31 Co–Ni3S2,32 and CoFeS2 (ref. 33)) to prevent catalyst poisoning. Jin et al. reported a Cu2S micro-flake catalyst supported on nickel foam (Cu2S/NF) and found that Cu+ as a soft acid has a higher chemisorption capacity for HS− ions as a soft base than Ni, Co, and Fe-based sulfides, thus showing better SOR performance.34 Unfortunately, Cu is not an ideal catalyst for the HER, but the combination of Cu with other elements by the alloy effect can effectively improve HER performance. Chen et al. reported Co-incorporated Cu–catecholate nanorod arrays. DFT calculations show that the introduction of cobalt can drive the adsorption energy of the Cu site for hydrogen (ΔGH*) close to that of Pt (111).35 In addition, compared to sulfides or oxides of transition metals, transition metal nitrides often exhibit high electrical conductivity and low electrical resistance, showing superior electrocatalytic activity for the HER.36–40 For example, Co2N can provide the active sites to adsorb *OH41,42 and Cu4N can be used as the active site to desorb H* to improve the release of H2.43 Therefore, CuCo-based materials are potential catalysts for the HER and SOR.
Based on the above analysis, we propose a hybrid water electrolysis system with the HER and SOR, where the cathode hydrogen evolution electrode is CuCo-based nitride (CuCoN/CC) and the anode sulfur oxidation electrode is CuCo-based sulfide (CuCoS/CC). The HER//SOR hybrid water electrolysis system requires a cell voltage of 0.75 V to provide a current density of 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M NaOH//1 M NaOH with 4 M Na2S hybrid electrolytes, which was much lower than the 1.93 V in 1 M NaOH. This means that the HER//SOR system can reduce power consumption by 61.1% at this current density. At 10 mA cm−2, the energy saving can reach 87.2%. In addition, the system can maintain catalytic stability for 144 h. This work not only establishes an efficient hybrid water electrolysis system for economical hydrogen production but also provides a new idea for the treatment of petrochemical toxic waste.
Experimental
Materials and chemicals
Copper(II) nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 99%), cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 99%), urea (H2NCONH2, 99%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 98%), sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O, 98%), sublimed sulfur (S, 99.5%), Pt/C (20 wt%), and RuO2 (20 wt%) were purchased from Aladdin.
Synthesis of CuCoO nanosheets on carbon cloth (CuCoO/CC)
CuCoO/CC was synthesized by a hydrothermal reaction. Before the growth process, carbon cloth (CC, 2 cm × 4 cm) was pre-treated successively in acetone, ethanol, deionized water, and HNO3, and then dried at 60 °C in a vacuum for further use. To synthesize CuCoO/CC, 0.75 mmol Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 0.75 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and 6 mmol urea were dissolved in 40 mL deionized water to form a homogeneous precursor solution. After this, a piece of pre-treated CC and precursor solution were transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (50 mL) and then kept at 120 °C for 5 h. The resultant CuCoO/CC was washed with ethanol and deionized water and dried at 50 °C for further use. CuO/CC and CoO/CC were synthesized using the same method without adding Co(NO3)2·6H2O or Cu(NO3)2·3H2O.
Synthesis of CuCoS/CC and CuCoN/CC
To synthesize CuCoS/CC, a mixture containing 1 mmol Na2S, 35 mL water, and as-obtained CuCoO/CC was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 8 h. After cooling to room temperature, CuCoS/CC was washed with ethanol and deionized water. CuS/CC and CoS/CC were synthesized by the same method using CuO/CC and CoO/CC as the precursor materials. To synthesize CuCoN/CC, the as-obtained CuCoO/CC was calcined in a tube furnace at 400 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 under a flowing NH3 atmosphere and kept for 2 h. After the reaction temperature was cooled to room temperature, CuCoN/CC was collected for subsequent characterization and performance measurement.
Characterization
The microstructure of the CuCo-based nanosheet array was characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS Gemini SEM 500) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Talos S-FEG). Elemental mapping of the CuCo-based nanosheet array was performed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). The crystal structure of the CuCo-based nanosheet array was analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD). The chemical state analysis of the CuCo-based nanosheet array was obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis Ultra DLD Kratos AXIS SUPRA).
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements were divided into three parts, namely the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR), and the coupled HER//SOR reaction. HER and SOR measurements of CuCo-based nanosheet arrays were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E) using a three-electrode cell system containing a working electrode (CuCo-based nanosheet array), counter electrode (carbon rod), and reference electrode (Hg/HgO). For HER measurements, CuCoN/CC served as the working electrode and the electrolyte was 1.0 M NaOH. For SOR measurements, CuCoS/CC served as the working electrode and the electrolyte was 1.0 M NaOH with 4 M Na2S. 95% iR compensation was performed in the measurements to compensate for electrolyte resistance unless otherwise noted. All potential values were calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Nernst equation (ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.0591 × pH + 0.098). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were measured at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra of the CuCo-based nanosheet array were obtained in a frequency range of 0.1–100 kHz. Since the cathode and anode react with different electrolytes, an H-type electrolytic cell separated by a cation-exchange membrane was chosen for the electrochemical measurements of the HER//SOR. For HER//SOR measurements, we assembled a two-electrode system with a CuCoS/CC electrode as the anode and CuCoN/CC as the cathode.
To calculate the faradaic efficiency (FE) of the HER, the generated H2 was collected by using the drainage method, which was calculated using eqn (1), where Z1 is the number of electrons required to produce an H2 molecule, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), and Q1 is the total consumed charge during the HER. (1)
Before calculating the mass of S in the anolyte, HCl needs to be added dropwise to the electrolyte in an ice-water bath until the pH was adjusted to 1, and the product was collected by centrifugation. The FE of S is calculated using eqn (2). Q2 is the total consumed charge during the SOR and Z2 is the number of electrons producing an S molecule. (2)
Results and discussion
As shown in the schematic illustration (Fig. 1), we have established a hybrid water electrolysis system combining the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) to solve the problem of slow kinetics and high energy consumption of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Hereof, CuCoN/CC and CuCoS/CC were constructed for cathodic hydrogen evolution and anodic sulfion oxidation, respectively. As a precursor material, CuCoO/CC was prepared in a mixture of Cu(NO3)2, Co(NO3)2, urea, deionized water, and carbon cloth by a hydrothermal process.

From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. S1a and b†), it can be seen that CuCoO/CC was uniformly grown on the carbon cloth in a nanosheet array structure. As shown in transmission electron microscope (TEM) images (Fig. S1c and d†), the nanosheet structure of CuCoO/CC disclosed a smooth and flat state. Then, the crystal structure of CuCoO/CC was analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD). As shown in Fig. S2,† except for the diffraction peak of the substrate, the peaks at 18.9°, 24.0°, 28.1°, 29.7°, 33.9°, 37.4°, and 38.9° were indexed to Cu2CoO3 (JCPDS no. 21-0288), corresponding to (002), (010), (101), (011), (012), (111), and (004) planes. Afterward, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of the white region in Fig. S1d† manifested clear lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.317 and 0.471 nm, corresponding to the (010) and (002) planes of CuCoO/CC (Fig. S1e†). The HAADF-STEM image and corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental mapping images showed that Cu, Co, and O were evenly distributed (Fig. S1f†). The atomic ratio of the elements was Cu:Co:O = 19.32:8.65:72.03 in the corresponding EDX spectra (Fig. S3b†).
After this, the as-prepared CuCoO/CC was reacted with NH3 or Na2S to synthesize CuCoN/CC or CuCoS/CC, respectively (Fig. 1). For CuCoS/CC, the morphology of CuCoS/CC still maintained the nanosheet array structure, but a large number of nanoparticles appeared on the surface of the nanosheets after vulcanization (Fig. 2a and b). TEM images also illustrated the existence of nanoparticles (Fig. 2c and d). The high-resolution TEM image showed clear lattice fringes, which correspond to the (111) and (022) planes of the CuCoS/CC (Fig. 2e). The XRD pattern showed that the crystal structure of CuCoS/CC changed from Cu2CoO3 to CuCo2S4 (JCPDS no. 42-1450) after vulcanization (Fig. 2f). The HAADF-STEM image and corresponding EDX elemental mapping images showed that Cu, Co, and S were evenly distributed (Fig. 2g). In addition, the atomic ratio was Cu:Co:S = 22.82:23.12:54.06 (Fig. S3d†). Then, we investigated the chemical state of CuCoS/CC by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The peaks at 932.2 eV and 933.7 eV were attributed to Cu+ and Cu2+, respectively (Fig. S4a†).44 According to the Co 2p spectrum shown in Fig. S3b,† the Co species were found to exist in the Co3+ and Co2+ states (Fig. S4b†).45 For S species, the peak at 161.3 eV was attributed to S 2p3/2 and the peak at 162.8 eV was attributed to S 2p1/2.46 As seen, the binding energy of Cu species had positive shifts and Co species had negative shifts compared to CuCoO/CC which confirmed that vulcanization had a strong influence on the electronic state of the surrounding Cu and Co atoms.

(f) XRD pattern of CuCoS/CC. (g) HAADF-STEM image and the corresponding EDX elemental mapping images of CuCoS/CC. The inset of (c) shows the SAED pattern of CuCoS/CC. 
For CuCoN/CC, we also characterized its morphology, crystal structure, and chemical state. After calcination with NH3 at 400 °C for 2 h, the morphology of CuCoN/CC is present as a nanosheet array with some pores (Fig. 3a–d). We speculate that the formation of pores was due to the change in crystal structure and the influence of NH3 gas. Different from that of CuCoO/CC, the nanosheet structure of CuCoN/CC was rough. Interestingly, the HRTEM image showed that CuCoN/CC exists as a heterostructure of Cu and CuCoN0.6 (Fig. 3e). This phenomenon was also verified by XRD (Fig. 3f). This is because, in the nitrogenization process, NH3 gas not only can convert Cu2CoO3 to CuCoN0.6 (JCPDS no. 53-0435) but also can convert the oxidized copper into its elemental form. EDX characterization showed the uniform distribution of elements (Fig. 3g). The atomic ratio of Cu, Co, and N was about 23.64:45.88:30.48 (Fig. S3f†). After fitting the Cu 2p spectrum of CuCoN/CC, the chemical states of Cu species were Cu, Cu+, and Cu2+, which was a match with the aforementioned characterization results (Fig. S4d†). In the Co 2p spectrum, the peaks at 779.4 and 795.4 eV were attributed to Co3+ and the peaks at 781.3 and 796.9 eV were attributed to Co2+ (Fig. S4e†). The N–M bond observed from the N 1s spectrum of CuCoN/CC illustrated the formation of metal nitrides (Fig. S4f†).47,48 According to the aforementioned characterization results, we believe that the as-obtained CuCoN/CC composites possess abundant metal/metal nitride interfaces, which can expose more active sites and accelerate the migration of the reactants, resulting in the potential for the excellent catalytic activity.

Since the coupling of the HER//SOR involves two half-reactions, the hydrogen evolution performance and sulfion oxidation performance of CuCo-based nanosheet arrays should be tested separately. The electrochemical performance of CuCo-based nanosheet arrays was evaluated in a traditional three-electrode system with Hg/HgO, a carbon rod, and sample catalysts serving as the reference electrode, counter electrode, and working electrode, respectively. Before testing the SOR performance of CuCoS/CC, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of CuCoS/CC with a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1 in different concentrations of Na2S and NaOH hybrid solutions were tested to determine the optimal electrolyte ratio. The SOR performance of CuCoS/CC improved with an increase in the Na2S concentration (Fig. S5†). Hence, the concentration of 1 M NaOH with 4 M Na2S was selected for subsequent SOR performance tests.
As depicted in Fig. 4a, we compared the SOR and OER performances of CuCoS/CC. Due to the thermodynamic advantages of the SOR, the potential of the SOR can be greatly improved compared with that of the OER. Specifically, the CuCoS/CC electrode requires a potential of 1.44 V to provide a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in the NaOH solution, which was much higher than the 0.26 V in 1 M NaOH with 4 M Na2S electrolytes. In addition, at a current density of 100 mA cm−2, the overpotential of the SOR was 1.33 V lower than that of the OER. To study the effect of elements on the performance, CoS/CC and CuS/CC were synthesized for comparison. It can be observed that the morphology of CuS/CC and CoS/CC was a nanoplate (Fig. S6†) and nanowire (Fig. S7†), respectively. Compared to the LSV curves of CuCoS/CC and contrast samples in 1 M NaOH with 4 M Na2S electrolytes, CuCoS/CC showed a more positive SOR kinetic process (Fig. 4b). The introduction of sulfur also resulted in a stronger response of CuCoS/CC to sulfide oxidation than CuCoO/CC.

(c) Chronoamperometry curves of CuCoS/CC in 1 M NaOH + 4 M Na2S at selected potentials for 1 h and the corresponding electrolyte photos after the electrolytic reaction. (d) UV-vis spectra of the anolyte were diluted 100 times at selected potentials. (e) Nyquist plots for CuCoS/CC and contrast samples. (f) Chronopotentiometry curve for CuCoS/CC with a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 20 h. 
The potentials of CuCoS/CC and contrast samples with current densities of 50 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 are shown in Fig. S8.† The lower potential of CuCoS/CC than CuS/CC and CoS/CC indicated that the synergistic effect of Cu and Co leads to stronger SOR performance. More importantly, Cu in CuCoS/CC was found to exist mainly in the form of Cu+ from the XPS results (Fig. S4†). Cu+ is a soft Lewis acid site, which is easy to combine with the soft base of HS− in the electrolyte, enhancing the adsorption of sulfide ions and thus showing better SOR kinetics. Beyond this, as shown in Fig. S9,† we also compared the LSV curves over CuCoS/CC, CuCoN/CC, and CuCoO/CC. As seen from the electrochemical test results in Fig. S9,† the nitrogenization process not only did not improve the SOR performance of the precursor catalyst but also weakened the performance compared with vulcanization. That is to say, vulcanization was more suitable for CuCoO/CC to improve the SOR performance than nitrogenization.
Whereafter, chronoamperometry curves of CuCoS/CC in 1 M NaOH with 4 M Na2S electrolytes were tested at selected five potentials. Obviously, with the increase in electrolytic voltage, the color of the corresponding electrolyte deepened after the electrolytic reaction (Fig. 4c). After the electrolytic reaction, the electrolytes were measured qualitatively using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry. The UV-vis spectra of the anolyte diluted 100 times at selected potentials are shown in Fig. 4d. The results show that the absorption peak at 370 nm was due to the presence of short-chain polysulfide ions in the electrolyte. The UV-visible peak of the electrolyte increases significantly with an increase in the applied potential, which reflects the accelerated formation of polysulfides. With the sulfion oxidation reaction proceeding, the short-chain polysulfide ions fit together to form S8. The Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 4e revealed that the Rct of CuCoS/CC was significantly lower than that of the contrast catalysts, revealing that CuCoS/CC can facilitate electron transfer at the electrocatalytic interface. The ECSAs of the SOR are reflected by the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) at the solid–liquid interface, which is investigated by cyclic voltammetry measurements in the range of 0.115 V to 0.215 V (Fig. S10†). As expected, the CuCoS/CC exhibited the highest Cdl value, indicating the highest ECSAs relative to those of the contrast samples. The durability test result of CuCoS/CC at 10 mA cm−2 for 20 h indicated excellent electrocatalyst durability (Fig. 4f).
Subsequently, the electrochemical performance of the catalyst in the cathodic hydrogen evolution half reaction was evaluated. CuCoN/CC was the main research object, and CuCoS/CC, CuCuO/CC, Pt/C/CC, and CC were used as comparison samples. Before the HER test, we recorded the LSV curves of CuCoN/CC in 1 M NaOH or 1 M NaOH with 4 M Na2S. As shown in Fig. S11,† the HER performance of CuCoN/CC decreased significantly in the Na2S-containing electrolyte. Thus, 1 M NaOH solution was selected as the electrolyte for the HER. The LSV curves after iR compensation are shown in Fig. 5a. Compared with CuCoO/CC, CuCoN/CC obtained after nitriding treatment has a lower HER overpotential. We conclude that nitriding treatment makes CuCoN/CC possess rich metal/metal nitride interfaces, which exposes rich electroactive sites and accelerates the mass transfer process, thus resulting in excellent HER activity. It can be found that CuCoS/CC shows similar HER performance as CuCoO/CC, but there is a significant gap between CuCoN/CC and CuCoS/CC.

(e) The comparison of the HER polarization curves of CuCoN/CC before and after a durability test. (f) Chronopotentiometry curve for CuCoN/CC with a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 20 h. 
As shown in Fig. 5b, we compared the overpotentials of various catalysts at different current densities. CuCoN/CC required an overpotential of 214 mV to reach 100 mA cm−2, which is much lower than those required by CuCoS/CC (365 mV) and CuCuO/CC (375 mV). As the current densities increased, the LSV curve of CuCoN/CC was much close to that of benchmark commercial Pt/C/CC. Tafel slope is an important evaluation index of hydrogen evolution kinetics. The Tafel slope of catalysts was calculated using LSV curves. As shown in Fig. 5c, relative to that of CuCoS/CC (180.9 mV dec−1), CuCuO/CC (103.1 mV dec−1), Pt/C/CC (68.7 mV dec−1), and CC (245.6 mV dec−1), CuCoN/CC shows a much smaller Tafel slope (67.4 mV dec−1), which validates the faster electron-transfer kinetics during the HER. The large overpotential and Tafel slope of the conductive substrate carbon cloth in the HER indicate that the excellent HER performance of CuCoN/CC is attributed to the CuCoN nanosheet array rather than the carbon cloth substrate. The Nyquist plots in Fig. 5d revealed that the Rct of CuCoN/CC was significantly lower than that of the contrast catalysts, revealing that CuCoN/CC can facilitate electron transfer at the electrocatalytic interface. The ECSAs of the HER are reflected by the Cdl at the solid–liquid interface, which is investigated by cyclic voltammetry measurements in the range of 1.055 V to 1.155 V (Fig. S12†). As expected, CuCoN/CC exhibited the highest Cdl value, indicating the highest ECSAs relative to those of the contrast samples. Next, the catalytic stability and durability for the HER over CuCoN/CC were evaluated by both 2000-cycle continuous CV scans and long-term chronopotentiometry tests. As displayed in Fig. 5e, the LSV curve after 2000 CV cycles nearly overlaps with the primary one. The durability test result of CuCoN/CC at 10 mA cm−2 for 20 h indicated excellent electrocatalyst durability (Fig. 5f).
Since the electrolytes for the cathodic and anodic reactions are different, an H-type electrolytic cell separated by a cation-exchange membrane was chosen for the electrochemical performance test of the HER//SOR. The coupling reaction was performed using CuCoN/CC as the cathode electrode and CuCoS/CC as the anode electrode (Fig. 6a). Due to the influence of the cation-exchange membrane, we can only perform 70% iR compensation to compensate for the electrolyte resistance in the measurement. The LSV curves show that the coupling of the HER and SOR has a great improvement in cell voltage compared to conventional electrolytic water (Fig. 6b).

The stability of the HER//SOR coupling system was then tested. Since the Na2S in the anode electrolyte was continuously consumed as the reaction proceeded, we replaced the anode electrolyte with a new one every 24 h, and also acidified, centrifuged, and dried the reacted electrolyte to obtain the anode product sulfur powder. As seen in Fig. 6c, the i–t curve was relatively stable at the beginning of the coupling reaction, but the current density would show a decreasing trend with the consumption of Na2S. However, after replacing the electrolyte with a new one, the current density of the system returned to its normal value again. The overall current density showed a stable state after this repeated test for 144 h, which also indicates that the coupled reaction system constructed by CuCo-based nanosheet arrays is of excellent catalytic stability and durability. After the electrolysis process, the TEM images of CuCoN/CC and CuCoS/CC are shown in Fig. S13 and S14.† It can be seen from the results that the morphologies of CuCoN/CC and CuCoS/CC can be basically maintained after a long-term stability test. In addition, we compared the mass of sulfur powder obtained from the reaction with the theoretical value and found that they almost overlapped, which also indicates that only the SOR occurs at the anode and not the OER (Fig. 6d). Then, we tested the XRD of the product obtained after the treatment and confirmed that the product obtained was indeed sulfur powder (Fig. S15†). Photographs of the sulfur powder obtained by the reaction are shown in the inset of Fig. S15.† Since the reaction yielded more than 4.3 g of sulfur powder which is much higher than the amount of CuCoS, this also indicates that the sulfur obtained from the reaction was from the reaction of Na2S and not from the very small amount of elemental sulfur in the catalyst. The Faraday efficiency for the conversion of Na2S to sulfur in this system was calculated to be 99.14%. We also tested the Faraday efficiency of the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction, and the results showed that the Faraday efficiency was close to 100% (Fig. 6e).
Conclusion
In summary, we prepared CuCoN/CC and CuCoS/CC by a two-step method using CuCoO/CC as the precursor material. A hybrid electrolytic water system coupled with the HER and SOR was established using these two catalysts as the cathode and anode electrodes, respectively. The system requires only a cell voltage of 0.75 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm−2 in the 1 M NaOH//1 M NaOH + 4 M Na2S hybrid electrolytes, with Faraday efficiencies of nearly 100% for both the cathode and anode and maintains electrocatalytic stability for up to 6 days. This work provides a system for electrocatalytic sulfion recycling assisted energy-saving hydrogen production using CuCo-based nanosheet arrays.
