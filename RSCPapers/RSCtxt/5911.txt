    , Accepted 21st June 2022First published on 1st July 2022AbstractInterfaces composed of three-dimensional (3D) and 2D organic–inorganic hybrid formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) linked by organic spacers (OSs) are studied using first-principles calculations. The OS cations with aromatic rings, like phenylethylammonium and anilinium (AN), are found to be more favourable for enhancing the stability of the 3D/2D interface than butylammonium with aliphatic chains. The AN-based interface shows the highest resistance to penetration of water molecules.
Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites (HHPs), such as methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3+) and formamidinium (FA, CH(NH2)2+) lead iodides, have been attracting a great deal of research interest as promising photo-absorbers for perovskite solar cells (PSCs),1,2 due to their excellent opto-electronic properties and low fabrication costs.3–6 In spite of the rapidly increasing power conversion efficiency of PSCs, their commercial widespread applications are impeded by poor stability against extrinsic factors such as moisture, ultraviolet light and oxygen, along with the fast degradation of solar cell performance.7–11
Recently, the lifetime of PSCs has been significantly improved by introducing two-dimensional (2D) perovskites in junction with 3D perovskites, forming 3D/2D interfaces, due to the superior humidity resistance of the 2D part.12–18 Such dimensional mixing has also been revealed to increase the efficiency of PSCs, being attributed to the more favourable band alignment between the 3D/2D hybrid perovskite and the hole-transporting layer, as well as reduction in the trap state density.19,20 The orientation, distribution and concentration of 2D perovskites have been found to be critical factors in improving the charge carrier transport, while suppressing the exciton recombination, indicating that the efficiency and stability should be carefully compromised by 2D phase engineering.21,22 Most 3D/2D PSCs were fabricated by adding larger aromatic or aliphatic ammonium cations as an organic spacer (OS) between the 3D and 2D perovskite layers in a solution-processing method.23–26 The widely used ammonium cation spacers are n-butylammonium (BA+, C4H9NH3+), 2-phenylethylammonium (PEA+, C6H5(CH2)2NH3+), and anilinium (AN+, C6H5NH3+).21,27,28 As such, the OS cations are believed to play a bridging role to bind the 2D perovskite layer with the 3D perovskite bulk, while greatly enhancing the stability against moisture and oxygen.22 However, a perfect understanding of the formation of OS-bridged 3D/2D perovskite interfaces and the following performance improvement is not yet fully established.
In this work, we perform first-principles calculations within the density functional theory (DFT) framework to explicitly elucidate the mechanism behind the improved water stability of HHP-based PSCs by forming a 3D/2D perovskite interface while characterizing their binding and electronic properties. We construct the 3D/2D interface systems using the typical HHP FAPbI3 (FAPI) and the three different OS cations of BA+, PEA+ and AN+ as they have representative functional groups like aliphatic, aromatic and conjugate aromatic ones, respectively. The moisture stability of these 3D/2D interfacial systems is estimated by simulating the penetration of a water molecule through the interface. We reveal that the OS cations with aromatic rings, such as PEA and AN, are more favourable for improving the structural and moisture stability of the 3D/2D perovskites than those with aliphatic chains, like BA. The conjugate aromatic AN-based system is found to be the most promising among the three cations, presenting the strongest binding energy, most preferable electronic structure and highest resistance to water penetration.
For modeling, pseudocubic unit cells are adopted for FAPI, of which the lattice constant is obtained as 6.377 Å, in good agreement with the experimental value of 6.352 Å.29 The supercell of the interface system consists of three perovskite layers for the 3D part, two OS layers, and one perovskite layer for the 2D part, with a vacuum layer of more than 15 Å in the z direction (see Fig. S1(a and b), ESI†). For simulations of a water molecule penetration through the 2D/3D interface,(2 × 2 × 1) supercells (336, 368, and 320 atoms for BA, PEA, and AN, respectively) are constructed (for the computational details, see ESI†).
We first explored the atomic structures and bonding nature for the FAPI-based 3D/2D interfaces with the three different OS cations (see Fig. S1(c) and S2 for the optimized structures of the interface systems and isolated OS cations, ESI†). The ammonium-based OS cations are bound with the 3D and 2D perovskites via hydrogen bonding between the H atoms of the ammonium terminal (–NH3+) and the I atoms of the PbI6 octahedra. For the aliphatic BA+ cation, two hydrogen bonds are formed with the top I atoms and one hydrogen bond is formed with the I atom of the PbI2 sheet, whereas all the three hydrogen bonds are formed with the sheet I atoms for the aromatic cations of PEA+ and AN+. Therefore, the BA+ cation looks like approaching to the perovskite shallowly, compared with the aromatic ones (see Fig. S3–S5, ESI†). For all the three systems, the hydrogen bonding strength with the 3D part is stronger than that with the 2D part (see Fig. S1(d), ESI†). Among the OS cations, PEA+ shows the strongest H–I hydrogen bonding, while AN+ has the weakest hydrogen bonding with both the 3D and 2D parts.
Meanwhile, the OS layers interact with each other through the weaker van der Waals (vdW) dispersion. In addition, π–π interactions between the aromatic rings exist for PEA and AN and thus their corresponding binding energies Eb (1.08 and 1.32 eV) are higher than that for BA (1.01 eV) (see Fig. S6, ESI†). The conjugate aromatic cation AN+ has the highest OS interlayer binding energy possibly due to the strongest π-based interaction. In these interfaces, the two benzene rings are parallelly displaced, i.e., πd interaction according to the note of Hope et al.,23 which is more desirable than the parallel orientation (πp). This is attributed to areas of positive and negative electrostatic potential of the aromatic cores and their quadrupole moments (see Fig. S7, ESI†). The distance between the aromatic cores for the case of the AN+ cation is 3.16 Å, which is smaller than 3.55 Å for the PEA+ case. This indicates the stronger πd interaction in the conjugate aromatic AN+ cation than in the aromatic PEA+ in accordance with the binding energy. In particular, the interface space distance dint is found to increase from AN to BA and to PEA (see Fig. S6, ESI†), indicating that FAPI-AN with the shortest value of dint is the most favourable for transport properties. The formation energies are calculated to be negative for all three kinds of interface, indicating their spontaneous formation (see Fig. S1(e), ESI†). The formability is enhanced going from AN to BA and to PEA, being somewhat different from the tendency of binding energy but still low enough for FAPI-AN (−1.35 J m−2) to form readily.
Having explained the structural stability of FAPI interfaces with the OS cations, we will discuss the charge redistribution upon the formation of the OS-bridged 3D/2D interfaces and their electronic density of states (DOS). We first plot the spatial electron density difference obtained by subtracting the electron density of the isolated OS layer, 3D and 2D perovskite parts from the electron density of the entire interface system, as shown in Fig. 1(a). For the same value of isosurface (0.002 |e| Å−3), the charge redistribution gets more significant going from BA to PEA and to AN in accordance with the interface binding energy. The electron charge depletion appears around the OS cations, while the charge accumulation is seen around the I atoms and no charge difference is observed around the Pb atoms. This indicates that the electrons are transferred from the OS cations to both the 3D and 2D perovskite sides, as shown in Fig. 1(b) for the planar-averaged electron density redistribution. For BA, the electron charge loss centers around the ammonium group, while for PEA and AN, it spreads over the benzene ring, being more significant for AN. This charge redistribution induces a potential barrier, which hinders the transfer of photo-generated electrons and holes across the interface, explaining the remarkably lower performance of 3D/2D mixed PSCs than the 3D analogues.21,22 On the other hand, the charge redistribution is little found in the inner part of 3D FAPI, suggesting that the superior transport property of the 3D part is not affected by the interface formation. This highlights the potentiality of improving the performance of 3D/2D PSCs by tuning the orientation and distribution of the 3D and 2D phases.21

Isoline plots are also shown at the value ranging from −0.002 to 0.002 |e| Å−3. The yellow (positive value) and cyan (negative value) colours indicate the electron gain and loss, respectively. (b) Interface-induced electron density redistribution integrated over the x–y plane as a function of z coordinate, being divided into the 2D part, OS layer and 3D part contributions. (c) Total density of states (TDOS), where the band gap energies are shown explicitly, (d) partial density of states (PDOS), and (e) isoline plots of local density of states (LDOS) for the FAPI-OS 3D/2D interfaces. The Fermi level (EF) is set to zero. 
We then analyze the calculated electronic DOS to clarify the basic photovoltaic performance of these interface systems. As shown in Fig. 1(c) for the total DOS, the band gap clearly decreases going from BA (1.85 eV) to the aromatic PEA (1.76 eV) or AN (1.75 eV). Compared with the band gap of the 3D FAPI bulk, for which our calculations using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional30 give 1.48 eV in good agreement with the experimental value of 1.45 eV29,31,32 (see Fig. S10, ESI†), the interfaces exhibit increased band gap due to the effect of the interface and more importantly OS layer. As shown in Fig. 1(d) for layer-by-layer partial DOS, the electronic states of the OS layer are far away from the conduction band (CB) minimum composed of the perovskite part (for atom-projected partial DOS, see Fig. S11, ESI†). The valence band (VB) states of BA are also far below the Fermi level, whereas those of AN are close to the VB maximum. The layer contribution to the DOS is more clearly shown in the local DOS obtained by projecting total DOS weighted with the electron density onto the z direction, as shown in Fig. 1(e). While the band alignments are almost unchanged for the 3D and 2D perovskites, the BA layer forms deep wells for both the VB and CB states, indicating higher barriers for hole and electrons to move across the interface. By contrast, the band edge states of 2D for the aromatic PEA and AN cases are slightly shifted below in energy compared with the 3D states, which is beneficial to the charge carrier transfer. More interestingly, the VB states of AN do not make the well but show the smooth continuation from 3D to 2D parts, being of great advantage for holes to move through the interface.
We finally examine the penetration process of one water molecule moving from the outermost layer of the 2D perovskite to the top layer of the 3D part passing through the interface. Fig. 2(a) shows the division of the interface region into five or four sections, being labeled with S1 to S5, and the optimized geometry of the water molecule at each region. We performed nudged elastic band (NEB) simulations to determine the activation energy for water diffusion from each region to the next neighboring lower region. Fig. 2(b) presents the energy profiles for water diffusion in FAPI-OS interface systems. For the BA case, the diffusion barriers are found to be 1.12, 0.69, 0.17 and 0.09 eV at the T1, T2, T3 and T4 transition states, indicating that the first passing through the 2D part is the most difficult and then the diffusion becomes easier on going inside. This is due to the strong interaction between the Pb and O atoms at the T1 state and the relatively wide space and weaker vdW interaction between the BA and water molecules at the interlayer space. For the aromatic PEA and AN cases, the first diffusion barriers through the 2D part are even higher (2.13 and 1.89 eV) than that of the aliphatic BA case, indicating a stronger binding of water molecules to the PbI2 layer through the ionic bonding between the Pb and O atoms (for detailed structures, see Fig. S12, ESI†). What is more, one can see still fairly higher barriers as 1.11, 0.78, and 0.70 eV for PEA and 1.82 and 0.52 eV for AN for the subsequent diffusion processes through the OS regions. As the water molecule moves inside the interface, the states become energetically higher but the final states are found to be more stable than the initial states. Such difference in water diffusion is attributed to the distinct frame structures of the aliphatic and aromatic spacer cations. In contrast to the aliphatic BA case, the aromatic PEA and AN cations form narrower paths between the benzene rings and exhibit π–π interactions in addition to the vdW dispersion. In particular, the FAPI-AN interface system shows a higher energy state at the middle of the interface (2.85 eV) than the PEA system, due to the stronger binding strength as confirmed by the interlayer binding energy and charge redistribution. Therefore, it can be said that the AN+ organic cation is the most favourable candidate for improving the moisture stability of FAPI-OS 3D/2D interface-based PSCs.

The different coloured regions with labels from S1 to S5 represent divisional regions where a water molecule can locate stably during the water molecular diffusion process. (b) Energy profiles for diffusion of a water molecule from the outermost layer of the 2D part to the inside of the 3D top layer in the FAPI-OS interface systems. Si (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) indicates the relaxed stable state in its corresponding region shown in (a), and Ti stands for the transition state between the neighbouring stable states. The energies of the initial S1 states are set to zero for all the cases. Based on these energies, the relative energy values for the stable S states and the activation energies at the transition T states are displayed. 
To summarize, we have shown that organic spacer cations with aromatic rings are more favourable for enhancing the structural and moisture stability of 3D/2D perovskites than those with aliphatic chains, based on first-principles calculations. Among the three OS-bridged FAPI 3D/2D interface systems with the OS cations of BA+, PEA+ and AN+, the conjugate aromatic AN+ cation exhibits the strongest binding strength between the OS layers via the π–π interaction in addition to the vdW interaction. We further demonstrate that the FAPI-AN interface system shows the preferable electronic structure for photovoltaic performance and moreover the highest resistance to water penetration into the perovskite inside due to the strongest binding of water to the AN OS layer and the PbI2 layer. Based on this fundamental understanding of the 3D/2D perovskite interface, future studies are expected for the development of high performance PCSs.
