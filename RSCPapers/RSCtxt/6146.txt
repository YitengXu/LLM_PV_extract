    , Accepted 17th January 2023First published on 18th January 2023AbstractMany investigations have been carried out on the production of hydrogen (H2) by water splitting using energy efficiently. We investigated photoelectrochemical water splitting (2H2O → 2H2 + O2) using the surface plasmon resonance of gold (Au) nanoparticles, in which tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) was selected as the supporting material for Au. Au/Ta2O5 powder was prepared by using the deposition precipitation (DP) method and subsequent calcination, and an Au/Ta2O5 electrode having a Ta2O5 layer of ca. 3 μm in thickness and Au0 nanoparticles of 6.4 nm in average size was fabricated by using a squeegee method. The prepared powder and electrode were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode was used as the working electrode and the current–potential curve was measured under visible light irradiation, which showed photoresponse of more than 0.5 V vs. RHE. H2 and oxygen (O2) were continuously produced under visible light irradiation and with an externally applied potential of 0.8 V vs. RHE to a Pt counter electrode. The results of this study will provide a new strategy for photoelectrochemical water splitting using a plasmonic photoanode.
Introduction
Since hydrogen (H2) is one of the promising energy carriers, its production has attracted much interest of researchers in various fields.1–3 Of course, production of H2 without the use of fossil fuels is important for sustainable development worldwide, and some strategies for H2 production including electrochemical water splitting,4–8 photoelectrochemical water splitting9–12 and photocatalytic water splitting13–21 have been proposed. Since these methods store solar energy as chemical energy of H2, considerable interest has been shown in water splitting as well as artificial photosynthesis, i.e., reduction of carbon dioxide to other useful compounds.22–26 In electrochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting, electric power produced from renewable energy such as solar power, hydroelectric power, wind power or geothermal power should be provided. Photoelectrochemical H2 production began in the work of Fujishima and Honda using titanium dioxide (TiO2) that was published in 1972.27 They achieved water splitting by applying an external potential under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation using single-crystal TiO2 and a platinum (Pt) electrode.
TiO2 has been used as a photocatalyst because of its advantages including low price, high stability, wide variation of physical properties and high photocatalytic performance. However, TiO2 works only under the irradiation of UV light due to its bandgap of more than 3 eV, and sunlight, which we want to use as an energy source, contains only 5% of UV light. The bandgap of TiO2 limits its single use as a photocatalyst and energy-conversion material. In order to efficiently convert solar energy into chemical energy and electrical energy, the key to energy conversion is the efficient use of visible light, which accounts for approximately 50% of solar energy. Examples of photoelectrochemical systems for water splitting using visible light include the use of semiconductors with a narrow bandgap,13,18,28,29 dye-sensitized semiconductors30 and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of metal nanoparticles.31,32
Metal nanoparticles such as gold (Au), silver and copper show unique colors when their diameters are smaller than the wavelength of visible light (ca. 800 nm). This coloration is due to the SPR of metal nanoparticles. Nanoparticles exhibiting these characteristics capture electromagnetic waves when the electromagnetic waves match the intrinsic frequency of the electronic vibrations within the nanoparticles. Recently, plasmon-induced charge separation, in which the charge is transferred from resonant plasmon nanoparticles to semiconductors by an external photoelectric effect or direct interfacial charge transfer, has attracted much attention because it can be used for various applications. The photoelectrochemical reaction mechanisms using plasmonic photocatalysts are as follows: (1) SPR of nanoparticles under irradiation of visible light, (2) electron transfer from nanoparticles to the conduction band of supporting materials, (3) electron transfer to the counter electrode and cathodic (reduction) reaction there, and (4) anodic (oxidation) reaction over the electron-deficient nanoparticles. Such plasmon-induced charge transfer can be widely used for chemical reactions33,34 under irradiation of visible light and has been reported for H2 (ref. 32) and O2 (ref. 35) production reactions and for water splitting.31,36 Application of SPR for a photoelectrochemical system has been reported;33,37–39 however, stoichiometric production of H2 and O2 by SPR-induced photoelectrochemical water splitting has scarcely been reported and, in addition, the supporting material is almost limited to TiO2.31,40–42
In this study, a new photoanode was constructed using tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) as a supporting material for Au nanoparticles. The advantage of the use of Ta2O5 as a supporting material for plasmonic photocatalysts is its high (negative) conduction band potential (ECB). From the reaction mechanism (2) described above, the potential of injected electrons transferred to the counter electrode depends on the conduction band position of the semiconductor. The ECB of Ta2O5 lies around ca. −0.5 V,43,44 which is more negative than the ECB of TiO2, which is generally used as a supporting material for Au nanoparticles. Thus, the high potential of electrons transferred from Au via SPR can be maintained and transferred to the counter electrode at which they can be used for the reduction of protons (H+), resulting in H2 formation.45 Here we report (1) the preparation and characterization of a plasmonic Au/Ta2O5 electrode, (2) the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of the plasmonic Au/Ta2O5 photoanode and (3) water splitting (stoichiometric production of H2 and O2) in the plasmonic Au/Ta2O5 photoanode and Pt cathode system. This report is the first report of the use of Ta2O5 as a supporting material for Au nanoparticles and plasmonic water splitting using an Au/Ta2O5 photoanode.
Results and discussion
Characterization of Au/Ta2O5 powder

Fig. 1(a) shows a TEM image of Au/Ta2O5 powder. Fine nanoparticles were observed on Ta2O5, indicating that Au nanoparticles were successfully loaded on Ta2O5 by the DP method. Fig. 1(b) shows the size-distribution of Au nanoparticles loaded on Ta2O5. The average size of Au nanoparticles was determined to be 6.4 nm with a standard deviation of 1.2, indicating that Au nanoparticles homogeneous in size were introduced on Ta2O5 by the combination of the DP method and subsequent calcination.

Fig. 2(a) shows UV-vis spectra of pristine Ta2O5 powder and Au/Ta2O5 powder. In the spectrum of pristine Ta2O5 powder, light absorption due to the bandgap excitation was observed at less than 330 nm, which means that Ta2O5 has a large band gap (ca. 3.9 eV) and does not respond to visible light. In contrast to pristine Ta2O5 powder, Au/Ta2O5 powder exhibited strong absorption (extinction) at around 570 nm due to the SPR of Au nanoparticles as we have previously reported.45

To obtain information on the change in the bulk structure of Au loaded on Ta2O5 before and after calcination, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) was investigated. Fig. 3(a) shows Au LIII-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of Au/Ta2O5 before and after calcination together with the XANES spectrum of Au foil as a reference. Absorptions in the spectrum of Au/Ta2O5 before calcination were assignable to Au oxide (Au2O3),46 while the spectrum of Au/Ta2O5 after calcination was similar to that of Au foil. These results indicate that the bulk structure of Au nanoparticles loaded on Ta2O5 drastically changed from oxide to metal by calcination at 823 K in air.

To obtain information on the electronic state of Au around the outer surface of the nanoparticles, Au/Ta2O5/FTO was analyzed by using XPS. Fig. 3(b) shows the XPS spectrum of Au/Ta2O5/FTO around the Au 4f component. Two peaks were observed at 82.7 and 86.4 eV, which are assignable to Au0.47
Characterization of Au/Ta2O5/FTO

Fig. 2(b) shows UV-vis spectra of Ta2O5/FTO and Au/Ta2O5/FTO. The spectrum of Ta2O5/FTO was similar to that of pristine Ta2O5 powder as shown in Fig. 2(a). The SPR of Au in Au/Ta2O5/FTO slightly shifted to the shorter wavelength side, suggesting that the contact state of interparticles and/or the contact state between Au nanoparticles and Ta2O5 slightly changed during the preparation processes (probably the squeegee method and/or calcination). A slight increase in the spectra was observed between extinction due to Au SPR and photoabsorption due to the bandgap excitation of Ta2O5. Possible reasons for this are another SPR mode of Au nanoparticles, formation of defects in Ta2O5, Au atom doping to Ta2O5 and another electron transfer between Au and Ta2O5. However, we have clear evidence to explain the phenomenon.

Fig. 4 shows SEM images of FTO and Au/Ta2O5/FTO. In the TEM images of FTO (Fig. 4(a) and (b)), a dense FTO layer with a thickness of ca. 6 μm was observed on the glass substrate. From Fig. 4(c), the thickness of the Au/Ta2O5 layer was estimated to be 3.4 μm. In the top view of Au/Ta2O5/FTO (Fig. 4(d)), the surface morphology was different from that of FTO (Fig. 4(b)) because the surface of FTO was covered with Ta2O5 powder. On the surface of Ta2O5, nanoparticles having a relatively wide range of sizes from 10 to 60 nm were observed, indicating that sintering of Au nanoparticles loaded on Ta2O5 occurred in the fabrication process of the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode.
 Fig. 4  SEM images of (a) and (b) FTO and (c) and (d) Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrodes; (a) and (c) are cross-section views and (b) and (d) are top views. 
Impedance measurement was conducted to obtain information on the CB of Ta2O5 and the flat band potential (EFB) was determined by extrapolation to C−2 = 0 of the Mott–Schottky plot (Fig. S1†). The values of EFB of Ta2O5 and Au/Ta2O5 were calculated to be ca. −0.47 V vs. RHE and −0.46 V vs. RHE, respectively.
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of Au/Ta2O5/FTO

Fig. 5 shows CVs of the Ta2O5/FTO electrode and the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode using a three-electrode electrochemical cell in the dark. A peak due to the two-electron reduction of O2 was observed at ca. 0.5 V vs. RHE. The Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode showed larger anodic and cathodic currents because of the improved conductivity (Fig. 5(a)). Introduction of Au nanoparticles also improved the onset potential for water oxidation (1.87 V vs. RHE for Au/Ta2O5/FTO and 2.08 V vs. RHE for Ta2O5/FTO). Fig. 5(b) shows 3 cycles of a CV for the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode. No change in the current indicates that the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode was stable under the condition of the electrochemical measurements.

To investigate their photoelectrochemical properties for water oxidation, current–potential (V–I) curves of the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode and the Ta2O5/FTO electrode in 0.1 M KOH under visible light irradiation were determined without any additional electron donor (Fig. 6). The Ta2O5/FTO electrode did not show a photoresponse under visible light irradiation due to the large band gap (3.9 eV). On the other hand, an anodic photocurrent was observed for the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode as expected from its UV-vis spectrum. The inset figure shows a magnified view of the V–I curve at the region from 0.4 to 0.9 V vs. RHE, indicating that the photoresponse of the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode occurred at 0.5 V vs. RHE.
 Fig. 6  Current–potential curves of Au/Ta2O5/FTO (●) and Ta2O5/FTO (■) under irradiation of visible light from a Xe lamp equipped with an L42 cut-filter. 
Since the amount of Au loaded is one of the important factors to determine the performance of plasmonic photocatalysts, the effect of the Au content on the photocurrent was examined (Fig. S2†), which shows that the largest photocurrent was obtained at around 1.0–1.2 wt% loading and further loading of Au slightly decreased the photocurrent. Since it is favorable to reduce the Au content as small as possible, 1 wt% Au/Ta2O5 was evaluated in this study.
Photoelectrochemical water splitting over the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode and the Ta2O5/FTO electrode was investigated under the potentiostatic condition of 0.8 V vs. RHE, in which visible light from a Xe lamp equipped with an L42 cut filter was used. Fig. 7(a) shows time courses of the yields of H2 and O2, indicating that H2 and O2 were produced linearly with maintenance of the ratio of ca. 2 during the light irradiation. On the other hand, the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode did not produce H2 and O2 in the dark when 0.8 V vs. RHE potential was applied as shown in Fig. 7(b). It was confirmed again that no electrons are transferred from Au nanoparticles to the CB of Ta2O5 in the dark. Even under light irradiation, no water splitting occurred when the Au-free Ta2O5 electrode was used (Fig. 7(c)), indicating that the visible light irradiated did not induce band-gap excitation of Ta2O5. These results indicate that the water splitting was induced by the SPR of Au nanoparticles loaded on Ta2O5. Fig. 7(d) shows the time course of the photocurrent under light irradiation to the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode. A stable anodic photocurrent of ca. 5.5 μA was observed during water splitting. Values of Faraday efficiency (FE) calculated from the amount of H2 evolved and photocurrent (eqn (1)) were constantly about 65% during photoirradiation. (1)
 Fig. 7  (a)–(c) Time courses of the amounts of H2 and O2 from water and the ratio of H2 and O2 and (d)–(f) time courses of the current over Au/Ta2O5/FTO and Ta2O5/FTO at 0.8 V vs. RHE under light irradiation and in the dark. Visible light from a Xe lamp equipped with an L42 cut filter was irradiated to the electrodes. 
The reason for the values of FE not being 100% is the reverse reaction forming water over the Pt electrode because a single cell was used for water splitting. The values of FE would be improved when the anode and cathode cells are separated to eliminate the reverse reaction of H2 and O2. In the case of the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode in the dark and the Au-free Ta2O5 electrode under light irradiation, the currents were negligible as shown in Fig. 7(e) and (f), respectively. The results are consistent with no production of H2 and O2 (Fig. 7(b) and (c)). Several reported results for water splitting and water oxidation using photoanodes are summarized in Table S1.† Most of the reported photoanodes required an externally applied potential of ca. 1.0 V vs. RHE for water splitting and water oxidation. These results indicate that the performance of the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode for water splitting is fairly high. Water splitting using the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode was further investigated by increasing the applied potential. Fig. S3† shows time courses of the amounts of H2 and O2 under the applied potentials of 0.8 V, 1.0 V and 1.2 V vs. RHE. As expected, the rate of H2 and O2 production increased with an increase in the potential.
Differences in the bulk structure and the electron state of Au in the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode before and after water splitting were investigated by using XAFS and XPS. Au LIII-edge XANES spectra and XPS spectra of the Au 4f component in Au/Ta2O5 are shown in Fig. S4(a) and (b),† respectively. There was no difference in XANES and XPS spectra before and after water splitting, indicating that the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode was stable during water splitting.
To investigate the correlation between light absorption and photocatalytic activity, IPCE measurement was conducted (Fig. S5†). The values of IPCE were calculated using eqn (2). The IPCE spectrum showed a tendency similar to that of the extinction spectrum of the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode. Therefore, we concluded that photoelectrochemical water splitting over Au/Ta2O5/FTO was induced by photoabsorption due to the SPR of Au supported on Ta2O5. (2)
Conclusions
A new electrode was constructed using Ta2O5 as a supporting material for Au nanoparticles. Au nanoparticles were loaded on Ta2O5 powder by using the DP method and subsequent calcination, and then the Au/Ta2O5 powder was fixed on an FTO glass using a squeegee method and post calcination, resulting in the fabrication of an Au/Ta2O5/FTO photoanode having an Au/Ta2O5 layer of ca. 3 μm in thickness. The Au/Ta2O5 powder and the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode exhibited photoabsorption due to the SPR of Au nanoparticles around 550 nm. When the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode was used as a photoanode under an externally applied potential of 0.8 V vs. RHE to a Pt counter electrode, water splitting, i.e., evolution of H2 and O2 with the ratio of 2:1, occurred continuously under irradiation of visible light from a Xe lamp equipped with an L42 cut filter. As far as we know, this report is the first report of photoelectrochemical water splitting using Ta2O5 as the supporting material for a plasmonic photoanode.
Experimental
Preparation of Au/Ta2O5 powder
All of the reagents were commercial materials of reagent grade and were used without further purification. Commercial Ta2O5 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd, Saitama) was calcined at 873 K for 1 h under air. The calcined Ta2O5 was sieved and particles of which the sizes were smaller than 100 μm were used as the Au-supporting material.
Au/Ta2O5 was prepared by the deposition precipitation (DP) method and subsequent calcination. To 100 cm3 of an aqueous tetrachloroauric(III) acid solution (0.78 mmol dm−3, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Osaka), 1.0 g of urea (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) and then pre-calcined Ta2O5 (1.0 g) were added. The suspension was stirred at room temperature for 20 min and then stirred at 343 K for 2 h. After the suspension had cooled to room temperature, the resultant powder was separated by filtration, washed with distilled water (1000 cm3), and then dried at 298 K in vacuo for 3 h. The dried powder was calcined in a furnace in air at 823 K for 5 h. The amount of Au loaded on Ta2O5 was smaller than that used for deposition precipitation probably due to the small surface area of Ta2O5. When 1.5 wt% of Au was used, 1.0 wt% of Au was loaded on Ta2O5. In the main text, 1.0 wt%Au/Ta2O5 powder was used in all experiments.
Preparation of an Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode
The electrode consisting of Au/Ta2O5 powder was prepared by using a squeegee method. Polyethylene glycol 20000 (Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd, Osaka) (200 mg) and Au/Ta2O5 (400 mg) were added to a solution containing acetic acid (0.5 cm3) and distilled water (0.5 cm3) in a mortar. Acetic acid was added to stabilize the Au/Ta2O5 powder in the mixture. The mixture was stirred with a pestle for 15 min until the mixture became Au/Ta2O5 paste. A fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass slide (FTO) (AGC Inc., Tokyo) was cut into a rectangle with a size of 1.5 × 5 cm2 and masked with mending tape of 1.5 × 4 cm2 in size. The masked FTO was coated with the Au/Ta2O5 paste and then calcined at 773 K for 5 h. To avoid the change in properties of the Au particles loaded on Ta2O5, this process was conducted at 773 K which is lower than that for the preparation of Au/Ta2O5 powder. A pristine Ta2O5 electrode was also prepared by the same method. The fabricated electrodes are shown as Au/Ta2O5/FTO and Ta2O5/FTO.
Characterization
Diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were obtained with a UV-vis spectrometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu, Kyoto) equipped with a diffuse reflectance measurement unit (ISR-2600PLUS, Shimadzu) in which barium sulfate (BaSO4) was used as a reference. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for a sectioned view of the electrodes were obtained by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SU-8230, Hitachi High-Tech Corporation, Tokyo) operated at 2.0 kV in the Joint Research Center at Kindai University (JRC). Morphology and particle sizes of the prepared samples were observed under a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Tokyo) operated at 200 kV in JRC. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrodes were measured using an AXIS-NOVA ESCA (Shimadzu) in JRC to obtain information about the electron states of Au in the samples. Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrodes after cyclic voltammetry were used for the XPS measurements. Details of cyclic voltammetry are described in the next section. An electrode was set on a silver sample holder by using conductive carbon tape and was analyzed using Al Kα radiation in a vacuum chamber in 0.1 eV steps. The position of the carbon peak (284.6 eV) for C 1s was used to calibrate the binding energy for all of the samples. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were performed at BL-9C of the Photon Factory, Institute of Material Structure Science (KEK-IMSS-PF, Japan). Au L-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra were recorded in fluorescence mode at room temperature using an Si(111) double crystal monochromator. Au foil was acquired in transmittance mode as a reference.
(Photo)electrochemical measurements
(Photo)electrochemical measurements were conducted by using an electrochemical measurement system (HZ-7000, Hokuto Denko, Hyogo) connected to the Au/Ta2O5/FTO electrode or Ta2O5/FTO electrode as a working electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (saturated KCl aqueous solution), and Pt wire as a counter electrode. An aqueous KOH solution (1.0 mol dm−3, pH 13.6, 80 cm3) was used as the electrolyte in all measurements. A cyclic voltammogram (CV) of Au/Ta2O5/FTO and Ta2O5/FTO electrodes was recorded from −1.0 to 2.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a sweep rate of 50 mV s−1. V–I curves were constructed by performing constant potential measurements at each potential for 10 min and plotting the average value of the current at each potential against the applied potential under irradiation of visible light.
Photoelectrochemical water splitting
To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of Au/Ta2O5 and Ta2O5/FTO, water splitting was performed at 0.8 V vs. RHE in the dark or under photoirradiation. The reaction cell was irradiated from a 300 W xenon lamp (Eagle Engineering, Tokyo) filtered with an L42 cut filter (HOYA Corporation, Tokyo). The amounts of H2 and O2 in the gas phase were measured using a GC-8A gas chromatograph (Shimadzu) equipped with an MS-5A column.
