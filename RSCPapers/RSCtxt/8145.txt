    , Accepted 27th March 2017First published on 27th March 2017AbstractThis study reports on the synthesis and characterization of four molecular π-extended squaraine compounds relevant to the field of organic electronics. The compounds each consist of a bis-indole squaraine core end-capped with indoloquinoxaline units employing three different bridging units, namely thiophene, thiazole, and acetylene. Compound 10 bears a thiophene bridge, 11 consists of a thiophene bridge and fluorinated indoloquinoxaline terminal units, and compounds 12 and 13 are bridged by thiazole and acetylene, respectively. The final compounds are constructed using the atom economical direct (hetero)arylation or the classic Sonogashira carbon–carbon bond formation protocols. Each carbon–carbon bond forming reaction employing thiophene bridges (i.e. synthesis of compounds 10 and 11) has been optimized using the stable and reusable silica supported Pd catalyst, SiliaCat® DPP-Pd, streamlining the synthetic procedure. While compounds 12 and 13 were also accessible using the SiliaCat® DPP-Pd catalyst, the use of Herrmann–Beller and Pd(PPh3)4 catalysts, respectively, lead to improved isolated yields of the final materials. Compounds 10–13 were characterized by thermal gravimetric analysis, cyclic voltammetry, optical absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and each structure was analysed using density functional theory. All compounds exhibit high thermal stability and good solubility in common organic solvents, including in the greener alternative 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran. The reported compounds display stable ambipolar redox behaviour, furthermore, we have demonstrated that the frontier molecular energy levels can be effectively tuned by changing the bridging unit as predicted by density functional theory. Most striking is the drastic optical absorption profile changes observed from this class of materials upon post-deposition film annealing, suggesting molecular rearrangement in the solid-state. The induced changes and fine structure observed upon post-deposition annealing is unique to these π-extended squaraines with nothing like it reported in the literature for related squaraine based materials.
Introduction
Solution processable molecular π-conjugated materials have found extensive application in organic electronics. They have demonstrated success largely as semiconducting materials in organic photovoltaics (OPV)1–11 and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).12–21 While great improvements in performance have been achieved over the past few years, there is still a need for the design and synthesis of new materials for the progression of the field towards widespread commercial application.22–24 Specifically, targeted materials should be low-cost and easily accessed from straight-forward and sustainable synthetic and purification methods allowing for upscaling and use on an industrial scale.25–28
The synthesis of these materials relies largely on C–C bond forming reactions to piece together π-conjugated building blocks. The Stille reaction continues to be the most common cross-coupling reaction used to construct π-conjugated materials, however the method relies on the use of organo-tin directing groups which present challenges for a sustainable and atom-economical synthesis. The Suzuki reaction is well established and is an improvement on the Stille reaction in that less toxic organo-boron directing groups are employed, but the reaction is not considered atom-economical. The direct functionalization of C–H bonds is an ideal cross-coupling method as the process does not require organometallic directing groups, thus rendering synthetic routes much more straightforward and efficient.29,30 Considering these benefits, our research group has made an effort to design materials that are accessible from C–C bond forming reactions through direct C–H bond functionalization such as Sonogashira31 and direct (hetero)arylation (DHA) couplings.32–34 Of the two reactions, Sonogashira cross-coupling is the most established and while it does not require an organometallic directing group, it still entails additional protection and deprotection steps and is limited to ethynyl containing substrates.35–37 More recently, DHA has emerged as a more versatile C–C bond formation method, involving the coupling of aryl halides with catalytically activated aryl C–H bonds. DHA has demonstrated success with a large scope of commonly used organic electronic building blocks such as functionalized thiophenes, furans, and thiazoles with a wide range of aryl halides.38–45
In addition to exploiting DHA in the synthesis of materials, our group has identified an active, robust and reusable heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of molecular semiconductors via a variety of C–C cross-coupling reactions including DHA.46 Commercially available, SiliaCat® DPP-Pd, is a silica-supported Pd catalyst.47 Starting with simple thiophene based compounds,46,48 we have extended the use of this catalyst to more complicated systems that are based upon the well-known organic building blocks such as diketopyrrolopyrrole, isoindigo, thienoisoindigo, naphthalene diimide, and perylene diimide.32–34,49,50 Having proved effective for these materials, and the increasing need for more sustainable syntheses, we are interested in diversifying the substrate scope of our simplified DHA method to other aryl bromides and activated aryl C–H bonds towards new targeted materials for use in organic electronics.
New materials of interest include the use of squaraine dyes.51 Squaraine based molecules are attractive due to their ease of synthesis, low-cost precursor building blocks, strong low energy optical absorption in the near-IR, high extinction coefficients, photostability, and stable redox properties.52,53 In addition, their strong tendency to self-assemble into highly ordered nanostructures is desirable for charge transport processes.54,55 Consequently, squaraines have found success in a range of organic electronic applications.53,56–65 The majority of squaraine based materials reported are very small with simple donor–squaraine–donor structures, specifically arylamines or indoles condensed onto squaric acid. In the field of organic electronics, some of the best performing molecular systems have long π-extended backbones.66–68 A recent report by Kido et al. demonstrates the potential of π-extended squaraine dyes as donor materials in organic photovoltaics achieving one of the highest performing squaraine solution processed organic solar cells to date.69 Consequently, we are interested in development of larger π-extended squaraines towards potential new and improved materials properties relevant to organic electronic applications. This study highlights the unique material properties accessible through the π-extension of a bis-indole squaraine core with indoloquinoxaline terminal units installed through optimized Sonogashira reactions and DHA couplings.
Bis-indole squaraine was chosen as the core due to its strong near-IR optical absorption and simple three-step synthesis with a reactive bromide for easy functionalization.64,70 Previously reported by our group, indoloquinoxaline, a planar π-conjugated building block, was chosen as the terminal unit to extend the π-backbone. It's simple two-step synthesis, inexpensive starting materials, and ease of derivatization makes it an attractive building block.71 To link the indoloquinoxaline terminal units to the squaraine core, there are three bridging groups that are commonly employed to construct π-conjugated materials. Ubiquitous to organic π-conjugated materials is thiophene, which is arguably the most commonly used bridging unit. More recently, alkyne bridges have been used as a means to promote planarity ensuring a planar π-backbone ideal for self-assembly and charge transport.72–76 The less electron rich alkyne has also shown to result in the stabilization of the frontier molecular orbitals. Lastly, thiazole, can be considered an intermediate between the two bridges, offering a lowering of the frontier energy levels while also helping to planarize the π-backbone through its N-atom lone pair interactions with adjacent hydrogens. See Fig. 1 for the general architecture.

Results and discussion
Synthetic procedures
The terminal indoloquinoxaline unit (3) and its fluoro derivative (4) were prepared via facile high yielding microwave conditions (Fig. 2a). The acid catalyzed condensation of 6-bromo-isatin and o-phenylenediamine or 4,5-difluoro-1,2-phenylenediamine gave 8-bromo-6H-indolo[2,3-b]quinoxaline (1) or 8-bromo-2,3-difluoro-6H-indolo[2,3-b]quinoxaline (2), respectively, in 70–80% yield. Compounds 1 and 2 were subsequently N-alkylated with octylbromide under microwave irradiation yielding 3 and 4 (80–90% yield).

The various bridging units were installed on the terminal indoloquinoxaline unit via a variety of C–C bond forming reactions in high yields (Fig. 2b–d). The thiophene bridge was installed via a Suzuki coupling between 3 or 4 and 2-thienylboronic acid to yield 5 or 6, respectively, in 93–94% yield (Fig. 2b). The thiazole bridge was installed via a DHA reaction between 3 and thiazole (Fig. 2c) to give 7 in near quantitative yield. Literature reports have demonstrated that through varying the solvent and catalyst system, the selectivity of thiazole DHA can be controlled.77 In this study we observed exclusive electrophilic substitution at the 5-position of the thiazole ring under the reported conditions in near quantitative isolated yield as confirmed by 1H NMR and 1H–1H COSY 2D NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S18†). The acetylene-bridge was installed on 3via a standard protection/de-protection method (Fig. 2d) to give compound 8 isolated in yields upwards of 85%. In all cases the reactions were catalysed using the silica-supported catalyst, SiliaCat® DPP-Pd.
The brominated bis-indole squaraine core 9 (Fig. 3) was synthesized according to the three-step literature process.78 However, even after subsequent attempts at purification (column chromatography, recrystallization, and sublimation) trace impurities were visible in the 1H NMR spectrum of 9 (Fig. S1†). After a literature survey, it was found that these impurities have not been reported or discussed and the only study to include the 1H NMR spectrum was a recent report by Barolo et al. which was also shown to contain the same trace impurities observed in this study (Fig. S1†).79 This material and its structural analogues have been extensively used,80–83 especially in medicinal chemistry,84,85 where not unlike organic electronics, material purity is of high priority. We believe that the impurity may be a regioisomer as the commercially available starting material, 4-bromophenylhydrazine hydrochloride, appears to contain trace amounts of bromide regioisomers (Fig. S2†). The non-brominated bis-indole squaraine core (9a) synthesized following the same experimental procedure was found to contain no impurities by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S21†) which further suggests the impurities observed for 9 are brominated regioisomers carried through from the impure 4-bromophenylhydrazine hydrochloride. While we were unable to fully purify the brominated bis-indole squaraine core 9, the impurity was subsequently removed in the next step.

The final π-extended squaraine compounds (10–13) were prepared via DHA cross-coupling for the thiophene and thiazole bridged derivatives and by Sonogashira cross-coupling for the acetylene linked compound (Fig. 3). After an extensive literature survey, this study represents the first report of DHA cross-coupling being applied to squaraine dyes. Consequently, for the construction of 10, a range of temperatures, reaction times, solvents, and catalyst systems were screened in order to optimize the final DHA coupling process between the bis-indole squaraine core (9) and the thiophene indoloquinoxaline terminal unit (5) (see ESI† for details). It was found that the reaction only proceeded in dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethylacetimide (DMA) despite solubility of the reagents in a range of solvents (toluene, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4 dioxane). The use of the SiliaCat® DPP-Pd heterogeneous catalyst resulted in the highest isolated yields in addition to the cleanest product determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy in comparison to commonly used homogeneous catalysts Pd(PPh3)4 and Pd(OAc)2 (Fig. S4†). In addition to the improved performance, SiliaCat® DPP-Pd also offers ease of separation for reusability while limiting Pd contamination.46,86,87 The optimized DHA cross-coupling reaction conditions between 9 and 5 were found to be heating the reactants at 100 °C in DMF for 12 hours in the presence of potassium carbonate, pivalic acid, and SiliaCat® DPP-Pd (Fig. 3a). It was found that the reaction does not further progress after 12 hours due to decomposition of the squaraine starting material 9. It was determined that while lower temperatures resulted in no reaction, higher temperatures or heating at 100 °C for more than 12 hours in the presence of base results in the decomposition of the squaraine core 9 (Fig. S3†). The product (10) was isolated a dark green solid. Small-scale reactions using 100 mg of the squaraine core 9 only gave yields upwards of 55%, however a larger 500 mg scale-up reaction resulted in a 70% product yield. It is suspected that the small-scale yield was lower due to loss in work-up. The fluorinated derivative (11) was easily accessed by following the optimized DHA synthetic protocol for 10 (Fig. 3a). Compound 11 was isolated as a dark green solid (70% yield).
Applying the optimized DHA reaction conditions to the synthesis of the thiazole bridge derivative 12, was unsuccessful. The reaction proved sluggish with little to no product observed after 12 hours. Due to the decomposition of the squaraine core 9 after 12 hours (Fig. S3†), a catalyst that could push the reaction to further completion within 12 hours was required. Herrmann–Beller catalyst and tris(o-methoxyphenyl)phosphine ligand was chosen as the catalyst system due to its demonstrated success in thiazole DHA reactions as reported in the literature.39,77,88–90 Keeping the rest of the optimized DHA reaction conditions consistent, but replacing SiliaCat® DPP-Pd with Herrmann–Beller catalyst and tris(o-methoxyphenyl)phosphine ligand, lead to a much higher conversion to the desired product 12 (Fig. 3b). The final compound (12) was isolated as a shiny green/gold solid in 60% yield.
The acetylene-bridged derivative (13) was prepared via a Sonogashira cross-coupling between the squaraine core 9 and the alkynyl indoloquinoxaline terminal unit 8 (Fig. 3c). In this reaction, Pd(PPh3)4 lead to a better conversion of the desired product where SiliaCat® DPP-Pd resulted in a sluggish reaction with significant homo-coupling of 8, a common issue observed with Pd(II) catalysts.36 Homo-coupling of 8 was not observed with Pd(PPh3)4. Compound 13 was isolated as a shiny green/gold solid in 80% yield. All new materials synthesized were characterized by 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectroscopy when applicable, with proton peak assignments assisted using 1H–1H COSY spectra (see ESI†). Each final material (10–13) was additionally characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. S43–46†).
The final π-extended squaraine compounds are soluble in a range of organic solvents including halogenated solvents such as DCM, chloroform, chlorobenzene, as well as non-halogenated solvents such as o-xylene and in furan based solvents including THF and 2-methyl-THF, which is available from bio-derived feedstocks.91,92 Additionally the final compounds are thermally robust with decomposition temperatures above 320 °C (Fig. S48†).
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of this class of materials was evaluated using solution cyclic voltammetry (CV) with data summarized in Table 1. All four π-extended squaraine compounds (10–13) exhibit stable ambipolar redox behavior with two reversible oxidation and reduction events (Fig. 4). The redox stability of these materials is favorable for a variety of organic electronic applications involving charge transfer processes.

The ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) were estimated from the onset of oxidation and reduction respectively, relative to the internal reference ferrocene. These narrow-band gap materials have low IPs (4.64 to 4.86 eV) compared to other squaraine based materials which are usually above 5 eV.52–55,59,60,62,63,65,93–101 With IPs below 5.2 eV, these materials may be susceptible to oxidation in air which may affect the long-term stability of devices exposed to ambient conditions. Additionally, IPs between 5.2–5.8 eV are typically desired for use in OPV to ensure high open circuit voltage (Voc) which contributes to higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). From a molecular design prospective, using a different squaraine core or a more electron deficient terminal unit may lead to lower IPs.
Negligible effects on the electronic properties were observed through incorporation of fluorine atoms on the indoloquinoxaline terminal unit. Both 10 and 11 have the same EA of 3.19 eV and similar IPs of 4.64 and 4.68 eV, respectively. This result suggests that the electronics are likely dominated by the core and is supported by DFT calculations (Fig. S49–52†). Through altering the bridging units, the electronics of this molecular system can be systemically tuned. Replacement of the thiophene bridges in 10 with thiazole bridges to give 12, results in an increase in the EA from 3.19 eV to 3.36 eV and an increase in the IP from 4.64 eV to 4.86 eV (Fig. 4). This result is consistent with the thiazole bridge being more electron deficient, and thus removing electron density from the π-conjugated backbone. Compound 13 with acetylene bridges also has a higher EA and IP when compared to 10, consistent with the alkyne being a weaker electron donor than thiophene. Each compound was found to have the same electrochemical energy gap of ∼1.5 eV. The relative changes in energetics are reproduced using DFT methods (see ESI†).
Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra in solution and as spin-cast thin films are shown in Fig. 5 with parameters summarized in Table 2. Inherent to squaraine dyes, each compound has a high molar absorptivity (ε > 280000 M−1 cm−1), desirable for enhanced photon absorption. The absorption is dominated by the squaraine core with its narrow low energy band at ∼700–750 nm and higher-energy shoulder (∼650 nm). The indoloquinoxaline terminal units contribute small absorption from 300–550 nm. The absence of light absorption at 550 nm gives each of these materials their distinct green colour. Upon excitation at the maximum wavelength, compounds 10–13 each display slightly red shifted (ca. 15–18 nm) fluorescence in solution (CHCl3) (Fig. S47†). TD-DFT calculations reproduce the basic shape of the optical absorption spectra and reveal that the low energy band results from a HOMO → LUMO transition within the squaraine core and the high-energy band results from a HOMO−1 → LUMO+1 transition due to the bridge-endcapping units (Fig. S49–S51†).

Upon transitioning from solution to thin film, an overall broadening of the absorption profile is observed with a red shift of the onset and absorption maximum, which is typically observed for π-conjugated small molecules and is indicative of π–π interactions in the solid state.66,102–104 Each of the derivatives exhibit very similar solution and thin film absorption profiles to one another with the acetylene bridged derivative 13 displaying a 20 nm blue shift. No detectable fluorescence was observed for compounds 10–13 in the solid state.
Thin-film annealing
Despite the similar as-cast film optical absorptions, major differences are observed upon post-deposition annealing (Fig. 6). Post-deposition film treatment such as thermal annealing (TA) or solvent vapour annealing (SVA) are well-established methods for inducing a change in the orientation of molecules in the film as it allows for local rearrangement, driving the system towards the most thermodynamically stable state.103,105–111 Control over this ‘rearrangement’ by annealing can lead to improved performance in a variety of organic electronic devices.
 Fig. 6  Various post-deposition thin film annealing of 10 (a–c), 11 (d–f), 12 (g–i), and 13 (j–l). CF = Chloroform. THF = Tetrahydrofuran. 
Depending on the post-deposition treatment, each compound in this study displays vastly different absorption profile changes indicative of molecular rearrangement. For compound 10, a lowering of absorbance with increasing temperature is observed upon TA (Fig. 6a). No change is observed with SVA from CHCl3 (Fig. 6b), conversely SVA from THF results in the emergence of a sharp low energy peak at ∼780 nm (Fig. 6c). Compound 11 displays a blue shift and inversion in low energy peak intensities at 140 °C (Fig. 6d), a lowering in absorption is observed upon SVA from CHCl3 (Fig. 6e), and SVA from THF appears to result in an inversion of peaks like that observed upon TA but with the emergence of a third low energy peak (Fig. 6f). The thiazole and acetylene bridged derivatives 12 and 13 display the most significant changes upon post-deposition film annealing. Upon thermal treatment of the thin film of 12, a sharp lower energy peak at ∼780 nm appears and grows in intensity with increasing temperature (Fig. 6g). SVA from CHCl3 results in a slight red-shift as well as a sharpening and increase in absorption of the lowest-energy peak (Fig. 6h). SVA from THF leads to yet another drastic and unique change in the absorption profile where the main low energy peak is split into one lower and one higher energy absorption band (Fig. 6i). Lastly, compound 13 displays the most striking changes depending on the post-deposition treatment. Upon TA, the profile changes into four distinct vibrionic transitions spanning from 550–800 nm at 120 °C (Fig. 6j). The absorption profile continues to change with increasing temperatures with the disappearance of the small low energy transition at ∼780 nm accompanied by a blue shift and increase in absorption of the higher energy transition at ∼550 nm (Fig. 6j). SVA from CHCl3 results in a blue shift and the appearance of fine structure of the squaraine peak (Fig. 6k). SVA from THF leads to a similar profile to that observed from TA at 120 °C, however with a broader more shoulder like peak at ∼550 nm compared to the sharp peak observed with thermal treatment (Fig. 6l). Such changes in the optical absorption spectra likely arise from different intra- and intermolecular interactions/electronic coupling afforded by a change in planarity, shape and/or aggregation behaviour of the molecules.
The induced fine structure observed in the thin film optical absorption spectra is unique to the π-extended squaraines presented in this study. For comparison, a survey of squaraine based dyes used as donor molecules in OPV all show broad featureless absorption profiles in the solid state.52,53,55,57,59–62,65,69,93,95–97,99–101,112–116 This may point towards the indoloquinoxaline units imparting unique changes in the self-assembly of these materials, which may lead to control over nanoscale morphologies in blend films.
To gain insight into how the films are physically changing during the annealing processes, thin-films of 13 were analysed by XRD (Fig. S53†). We selected compound 13 as it showed the most dramatic changes upon thermal and solvent vapour annealing (likely a result of 13 having a completely co-planar π-conjugated backbone, see Fig. S52†). As-cast films did not diffract X-rays indicating they are amorphous. Upon heating at 200 °C a small diffraction peak emerges at 5.6° 2θ while SVA with THF results in a larger peak at 5.7° 2θ. No peaks were observed after treating the films at 120 °C or with CHCl3 vapour. The results indicate that regardless of the significant change in absorption profile, the films remain relatively the same and are not very crystalline.
Comparing the parent π-extended squaraine compound 10 to the non-brominated squaraine core 9b and the squaraine core functionalized with thiophenes 9Th (see ESI† for synthesis), the addition of the indoloquinoxaline units has only a slight effect on the optoelectronic properties (Fig. 7, Table S2†). We propose that this is due to the electron ‘neutrality’ of indoloquinoxaline as it contains both electron donating and electron withdrawing nitrogen atoms. The electron rich indole π-conjugated rings are proposed to be counteracted by the electron withdrawing pyrazene nitrogen because of the lone pairs being orthogonal to the π-system. These competing effects are thought to render the building block neither strongly electron donating or accepting, thus having minimal effects on the final material in terms of optoelectronic behaviour.71 Overall, the addition of the indoloquinoxaline results in negligible effects on the electrochemical properties other than the emergence of a second reversible reduction (Fig. 7b, Table S2†). As for the optical properties, despite the significant increase in π-conjugation length upon addition of the indoloquinoxaline units, only a slight red shift in absorbance is observed. However, the drastic changes in the optical absorption upon post-deposition thin film treatments are due to the indoloquinoxaline unit imparting unique changes in the materials self-assembly as these changes are not observed for the squaraine core 9b or 9Th.

Conclusions
The π-extended squaraines reported in this study are readily accessible through straight forward and sustainable synthetic protocols including DHA and Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions. This is the first report of DHA being applied to squaraine dyes expanding the substrate scope of this promising atom economical cross-coupling. All materials synthesized via C–C bond forming reactions were successful using the silica-supported catalyst SiliaCat® DPP-Pd, however it was replaced by a more active homogenous catalyst in the final coupling to form compound 12 and 13 to achieve improved conversion. Each compound was found to be thermally robust with decomposition temperatures greater than 320 °C by thermal gravimetric analysis. All compounds display stable ambipolar redox behaviour by solution cyclic voltammetry and show energy level tunability through the modification of π-bridging units, specifically thiophene, thiazole and acetylene. These strongly absorbing squaraine dyes (ε > 280000 M−1 cm−1) each display a strong low energy absorption band at ∼700 nm from the bis-indole squaraine core and a higher energy band at ∼400 nm from the indoloquinoxaline. Despite similar as-cast thin-film absorption profiles, post-deposition annealing was found to lead to drastic changes. Each compound displays unique absorption profile changes from one another as well as depending on the post-deposition treatment whether thermal annealing or SVA from CHCl3 or THF. Thermal annealing results in absorption profile changes for compounds 11–13, SVA from CHCl3 induces absorption changes for 12–13, and SVA from THF results in profile changes for all compounds (10–13). The drastic changes in optical absorption profiles are not accompanied by any significant changes in the crystallinity of the films. Indeed, films of 13 did not strongly diffract X-rays indicating a lack of long range order in the thin-film structure. In summary, the four π-extended squaraine dyes presented in this study are readily available from attractive synthetic methods and display promising molecular, optical and electronic properties for application in organic electronics. Furthermore, their unique behaviour upon post-deposition film annealing may present an avenue towards control in nanoscale morphology which can translate into improved device performance and warrants further investigation.
