This redox process yields CO, one of the main precursors for liquid hydrocarbon fuels, and inherently results in the recycling and valorization of the CO2 greenhouse gas. In this context, non-stoichiometric perovskites such as La1−xSrxMnO3−δ have emerged as attractive candidate redox materials because of their large oxygen storage capacities and exchange capabilities that are required for applications in high temperature thermochemical redox cycles for splitting CO2. This study addresses the investigation of reactive Mn-containing substituted perovskites derived from this La1−xSrxMnO3−δ series, where Ba2+, Ca2+ or Y3+ have been incorporated on the A-site. Conversely, introduction of Al3+ and Mg2+ on the B-site was also examined. The materials were synthesized and their structures were validated by powder X-ray diffraction. Their thermochemical redox performances were subsequently quantified by thermogravimetric analysis, while the microstructure of the polycrystalline materials was examined by scanning electron microscopy. High redox activity for CO2 splitting was observed for the majority of the substituted perovskites examined here, in which Mn was the single reducible cation and Mn4+/Mn3+ redox pair was activated in the oxygen-exchange process. The structural evolutions and thermochemical behavior are discussed with respect to the distinct chemistries of the additional cations incorporated in these Mn-based perovskites.
Introduction
Solar irradiation represents a powerful, sustainable and abundant source of energy. The solar-driven CO2 conversion into liquid hydrocarbons could ultimately offer the possibility to integrate renewable solar fuels into industrial and transportation sectors and would provide a sustainable pathway for the recycling of existing greenhouse gas emissions. The use of CO2 as a chemical feedstock to produce synthetic fuels is a great opportunity to consider CO2 as a resource that can be recycled rather than a waste with a cost of disposal. The solar recycling of captured CO2 to fuels is a novel alternative option to underground CO2 sequestration and storage. Among other processes, thermochemical reactions using concentrated solar power at high temperatures are particularly attractive and thermodynamically favorable for solar fuel generation due to potentially high solar-to-fuel energy conversion efficiency, deriving from the utilization of the entire solar spectrum, without the use of any precious metal catalyst.1 In this context, since industrial catalytic processes such as Fischer–Tropsch synthesis2 exist to convert syngas into liquid hydrocarbons, solar-driven thermochemical reactions chiefly focus onto the greatest challenge consisting of the generation of the precursors for this reaction, namely H2 and CO, that can be produced from H2O and CO2 splitting via similar reactions using concentrated solar energy as process heat.3
Since the direct thermolysis reaction (2CO2 → 2CO + O2) spontaneously occurs at very high temperatures (in excess of 3065 °C according to thermodynamics) that are prohibitive for large-scale solar facilities, metal oxide redox pairs are commonly used to decrease the reaction temperature. Two-step thermochemical cycles can therefore be used to produce CO (and/or H2) and regenerate the catalyst with the following reactions:
1. Solar-driven reduction, O2 generation: AOx → AOx−δ + δ/2O2 (T1, endothermic step).
2. Re-oxidation, CO generation: AOx−δ + δCO2 → AOx + δCO (T2 < T1, exothermic step).
One should note that beside the strong decrease of the reaction temperature (below 1600 °C), thermochemical redox cycling allows eliminating the need for high-temperature gas separation of O2 and CO. Nevertheless, some challenges remain and one of them is to reduce the operating temperature for maintaining thermal and chemical performances of the materials during cycling, while achieving large CO production yields. Several classes of redox-active materials can be considered, and they can be divided into two distinct categories: stoichiometric volatile or non-volatile oxides,4–8 and non-stoichiometric oxides involving solid-state reactions.9–11 Despite weaker oxygen storage capabilities, the non-stoichiometric oxides have recently attracted considerable interest, because they remain crystallographically stable during oxygen vacancies formation and O2 is the only gaseous species released during solid-state partial reduction, thereby avoiding products recombination encountered for volatile oxides (e.g., ZnO/Zn). Hence, significant H2 or CO productions and rapid kinetics were observed when using non-stoichiometric ceria or substituted-ceria as a catalyst for solar fuels generation,12–18 with operating temperatures that can be lowered to 1400 °C during the thermal reduction. Thus, the suitability of the CeO2/CeO2−δ cycle was proven under simulated solar conditions,15 and subsequent syngas production from CO2/H2O dissociation over ten cycles was later demonstrated.19 To date, the best redox performances in term of the magnitude of the fuel production for CO and H2 gases were observed in Zr-substituted ceria.14,17,20–23
More recently, non-stoichiometric perovskite oxides have also emerged as attractive candidates for solar thermochemical splitting of H2O and CO2 within a similar range of temperature.11,24–26 In particular, two-step redox cycling of Mn-based perovskites has been demonstrated with evolved CO or H2 amounts comparable with state of the art materials in the field of solar thermochemical fuel production.24–27 Indeed, the perovskite structures offer features reminiscent of a rich defect chemistry, that are comparable to the CeO2-based materials, with the possibility to stabilize mixed valent cations and large domains of non-stoichiometry. The former allows the structure to not undergo substantial cation rearrangement during the two-step process, while the latter is beneficial to the ion conduction necessary for redox reactions, with the generation of diffusion pathways through oxygen vacancies in the crystal network.
Based on the vast number of possible doping schemes, series of even more attractive materials remain to be considered, designed and tested. The potential promises of the ABO3 perovskite structure for thermochemical fuel generation certainly rely in its flexibility toward incorporation of various chemical elements on both A- and B-cation sites. This offers a number of potential formulations with multiple substitutions and doping strategies in order to improve their thermochemical performances. For example, such strategies already showed significant benefits in diverse areas including magnetism, mixed ionic-electronic conductivity (solid oxide fuel cells and membranes), high temperature superconductivity, ferro-electricity or multiferroics. Here, we focus on the La1−xSrxMnO3−δ series, which was recently shown to exhibit promising redox activity for both water splitting and CO2 dissociation,26,27 and several substitutions in these perovskites are explored in this study. Substituted compounds were synthesized with various amounts of Y3+, Ba2+ or Ca2+ incorporated on the A-site. Mg2+ and Al3+ were also incorporated on the B-site in an attempt to enhance thermal stability and resistance to sintering. The examination of the phase purity and structural evolution was performed by using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The investigation of the redox performances and thermal stability of these materials during two-step thermochemical cycles was carried out with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A significant CO2 splitting activity was observed for the majority of the synthesized compounds.
Experimental section
The different formulations of perovskite-based compounds considered in this study are listed in Table 1. Except for LSM-Al40 and LSM-Al60, the polycrystalline samples were synthesized by a conventional solid-state method with stoichiometric amounts of the appropriate precursors. For lanthanum-containing perovskites, La2O3 was fired at 950 °C prior to utilization, in order to eliminate La(OH)3 traces. Precursors were weighted before being ground together with an agate mortar and pestle. The resulting powders were introduced into alumina crucibles and fired at high temperature for 6 h. Grinding and firing were thereafter repeated until phase purity was reached and until no evolution of the peak profiles was observed in the PXRD diagrams. The latter point was checked because the evolution of the Bragg peak profile throughout regrinding and re-firing of perovskites containing multiple elements in the A- or B-site often indicates poor long range homogeneity of the cationic composition in the sample.

For samples having a large Al3+ content, homogenization was found to be difficult and samples were still multiphasic after six cycles of regrinding and firing at 1500 °C. The Pechini method was therefore applied for LSM-Al40 and LSM-Al60 to enhance rapid homogenization of the samples. Stoichiometric amounts of nitrate precursors were weighed and dissolved in distilled water with 1.5 equivalent of citric acid (CA) for 1 equivalent of metallic cations. Ethylene glycol (EG) was then added with a 3:2 CA:EG weight proportion. The solution was maintained at 90 °C until a gel was formed, which was later dried at 200 °C and calcined at 350 °C. The resulting ashes were fired at 1000 °C for 6 h and 1500 °C to stabilize the microstructure at high temperature and achieve thermal conditions comparable to samples prepared by the solid-state method. Table 1 summarizes the samples abbreviations and provides relevant information concerning their synthesis. Origin and purities of the precursors notified in Table 1 are: Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%); Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Merck, >99%); BaCO3 (Sigma Aldrich, >99%); CaCO3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%); La2O3 (Fluka Chemika, 99.98%); La(NO3)3·6H2O (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%); MgO (Alfa Aesar, >99%); MnO2 (Sigma Aldrich, >99.0%); Mn(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar, ACS reagent, 98.0–102.0%); SrCO3 (Sigma Aldrich, >99.9%); Sr(NO3)2 (Sigma Aldrich, >99%).
PXRD diagrams were collected at room temperature with an X'Pert Pro PANalytical diffractometer equipped with an X'celerator detector and working with Cu Kα1 and Kα2 radiations (λ = 0.15418 nm). The measurements of θ–θ symmetrical scans were carried out in the range 10–100° with a step size and a time per step fixed at 0.01° and 5 s respectively. Preliminary identification of crystalline phases was performed by comparison with standard reference patterns (Powder diffraction file PDF-2, International Centre for Diffraction Data, ICDD). LeBail fits of PXRD data were carried out with the Fullprof software28 included in the Winplotr package.29 Powders size and morphology were studied with a high resolution scanning electron microscope (FESEM Hitachi S-4800). Thermogravimetric (TG) data were collected using a SETARAM Sestys Evolution device, with sample masses of approximately 120 mg placed in a platinum crucible. The thermal reduction step was performed under an Ar flow of 20 ml min−1 (2 ppm O2), and CO2 was injected for the CO2 splitting step (CO2 mole fraction of 50% in Ar). All heating and cooling steps were performed with ramp rates of 20 °C min−1.
Results and discussion
A-site substituted perovskites
The synthesis of A-site substituted La1−xSrxMnO3−δ perovskites was carried out and the powder X-ray diffraction patterns collected for YSM50, LCM35, LCM50, LBM35 and LBM50 samples are presented on Fig. 1. The main peaks observed in all diffractograms were characteristic of ABO3 perovskite structures. Different peak profiles were observed on these perovskite main reflections, indicating the splitting of some reflections due to different crystal symmetries arising from distortions from the ideal cubic perovskite (Pmm). Some weak superstructure reflections were also clearly observed for some of the samples, for example in the 2θ range 50–57° for YSM50, LCM35 and LCM50 (Fig. 1). Additionally, a noticeable shift of the main Bragg peaks is observed from one sample to another, owing to the distinct radii of the elements incorporated in the perovskite structure. For example, structural changes are clearly observed as Bragg peaks are displaced toward lower angles from LCM50 to LBM50, in agreement with the increase of the A site cation radius (rCa2+ = 1.34 Å, rSr2+ = 1.44 Å, and rBa2+ = 1.61 Å).

Since not all of these compounds are reported in the PXRD diagrams databases such as the Powder X-ray Diffraction File PDF 2 from ICDD, it was important to index all peaks, including weak reflections, in order to ensure that those were actually arising from perovskite superstructures rather than from impurities. Indexation and LeBail fits were therefore performed on these samples (Fig. SI1†), enabling to confirm that all samples were single phase. The main results obtained from LeBail fits are summarized in Table 2 along with Goldschmidt tolerance factors calculated from data tabulated from R.D. Shannon for ionic radii.30 The evolutions of crystal symmetries we observe here are to be correlated with the variation of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor for the ABO3 perovskite31 and are in agreement with the symmetries reported for these compounds32 or others having closely related compositions or tolerance factors.33–36 Such correlation with the tolerance factor is for example well known in the La1−xSrxMnO3 series, where the sequence Pnma → Rc → I4/mcm → Pmm is observed as the Goldschmidt tolerance factor varies from 0.961 in LaMnO3 (x = 0) to 1.049 in SrMnO3 (x = 1), from values tabulated by Shannon30 for the ionic radii of La3+, Sr2+, Mn3+, Mn4+ and O2−. The trend we observe here is consistent with this behavior, with the evolution from Pnma to Pmm as the tolerance factor is elevated from 0.952 in YSM50 to 1.049 in LBM50.

Along with the symmetries, the results summarized in Table 2 also allow to ensure that all the cell parameter evolutions are consistent with those expected from the distinct perovskite compositions. Because of the crystal structure distortions resulting in perovskite superstructures of different orders, the unit cell parameters are not directly comparable from YSM50 to LBM50. In order to obtain directly comparable parameters, one can establish the crystallographic relationship of these cell parameters and of the volume of the unit cell with ap (Table 2), where ap is the cell parameter of a simple cubic perovskite. The parameter ap3 is then directly comparable from one composition to another, and relates to the volume per formula unit (V p.f.u.) for each perovskite compound. Then, the V p.f.u. increase when comparing YSM50, LCM50 and LBM50, can be reasoned by the increase of the average A-site ionic radius, whereas the decrease from LCM35 to LCM50 can be reasoned by a strong decrease of the ionic radius on the B-site, as Mn3+ is replaced by Mn4+ due to charge balance.

Fig. 2 shows the O2 production rates (Fig. 2a) and the mass variations (Fig. 2b) that were measured using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) during two-step thermochemical treatments of YSM50, LCM50, LBM50, with a reduction performed at 1400 °C in Ar for 45 min and a re-oxidation performed under CO2 (Ar:CO2 mole ratio of 50%) for 1 h at 1050 °C (two successive cycles). On each graph, the measurements for LSM50 under the same treatment27 are displayed for comparison. More details are shown in the ESI, with the variations of the oxygen non stoichiometry δ (Fig. SI2a†) and of the Mn oxidation state (Fig. SI2b†) during the thermochemical treatment. All samples examined here showed only partial re-oxidations, associated however with significant CO productions. Under these same conditions, LCM50, LSM50, and LBM50 show respective O2 productions of 311, 248, and 203 μmol g−1, whereas their respective CO productions during the CO2 splitting step are 210, 269, and 185 μmol g−1. LCM50, LSM50, and LBM50 start with a formal oxidation state of Mn+3.50. After reduction at 1400 °C, respective oxidation states of Mn+3.27, Mn+3.31 and Mn+3.32 are achieved. Re-oxidation leads to Mn+3.35, Mn+3.41 and Mn+3.42 final oxidation states. In term of redox activity, these samples show a similar behavior with respectively 0.23, 0.19 and 0.18 e− p.f.u. exchanged during the reduction. The activation energies (Ea) for this reduction step were found to be 158, 145, and 174 kJ mol−1, and details on the determination of Ea are given in the ESI (Fig. SI3†). The model used for these calculations was based on the shrinking core, which was previously validated to describe the reduction of non-stoichiometric perovskites.37 This model was also recently validated for CeO2, in order to describe the reduction process in this material.38 The results suggest a slightly lower standard Gibbs free enthalpy of reduction (ΔG0red) for LCM50 when compared to LSM50 and LBM50 which should themselves be characterized by a similar ΔG0red. The re-oxidation behavior is consistent with such characteristics, as LCM50, LSM50, and LBM50 undergo electronic transfers of 0.08, 0.10 and 0.09 e− p.f.u. suggesting a larger ΔG0ox for LCM50. This also shows that the lower CO productions in LBM50 when compared to LCM50 cannot be explained by a larger redox activity of Mn in LCM50 (same initial Mn oxidation state of +3.50 in both compounds), but rather by the large molar mass of Ba2+ (M = 137.33 g mol−1) as opposed to the lighter Ca2+ (M = 40.078 g mol−1), which decreases the final gravimetric production expressed in μmol g−1, despite superior electronic transfer in LBM50. Nevertheless, the performances of these compounds seem to be governed by very similar redox thermodynamics.

Purely in term of redox activity, these perovskites show performances superior to CeO2 during the CO2 dissociation step (CeO2 shows an exchange of 0.036 e− p.f.u.39 under similar conditions), and the electronic transfer in these materials is rather comparable to that in Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, which reaches 0.076 e− p.f.u.39 The superior performance when compared to CeO2 is clearly a result of different reduction thermodynamics, which limits the reduction extent to δ < 0.05 in the fluorite-based material at 1400 °C. The performances found in these perovskites indicate that their redox thermodynamics are more similar to Zr-doped ceria, in agreement with thermodynamic data reported for CeO2,40 (Ce,Zr)O2 (ref. 41 and 42) and Mn-containing perovskite compounds.26 For instance, the partial molar enthalpy of oxygen in CeO2 is about −480 kJ mol−1, whereas it is about −290 kJ mol−1 in Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 and −240 kJ mol−1 in LSM50.
YSM50 shows a very distinct behavior when compared to the aforementioned samples. Substitution of Y3+ for La3+ in LSM50 clearly enhances oxygen vacancy formation in the perovskite structure upon thermal reduction. Such finding is reminiscent of the LnBaCo2O6−δ (Ln = lanthanide or Y) family of non-stoichiometric double perovskites where δ monotonously increases when the size of Ln decreases.43 In that case, this phenomenon is attributed to the smaller coordination spheres and lower electropositivity of the smaller Ln3+ cations, favoring oxygen vacant environments. This may also explain the enhanced O2 production observed here for YSM50, which reaches 551 μmol g−1 after 45 min at 1400 °C. Moreover, the O2 production rate reaches a maximum at approximately 1315 °C during the thermal reduction, which suggests that the reduction temperature could be lowered without any significant alteration of the final yield. However, this good reduction behavior was not found to be beneficial to the re-oxidation by CO2, since the CO production with YSM50 reaches 112 μmol g−1 after 1 h at 1050 °C, as opposed to 269 μmol g−1 in LSM50. This strongly suggests a large change of the redox thermodynamics upon replacement of La3+ by Y3+, involving larger reduction capabilities but less favorable re-oxidation thermodynamics. As such the re-oxidation yields in YSM50 were found to be 10 and 9% during the 1st and 2nd thermochemical cycles respectively, which accounts for only a slight portion of oxygen released during reduction being recovered by the crystal lattice during the CO2 dissociation step.

Fig. 3 shows the O2 production rates (Fig. 3a) and mass variations (Fig. 3b) measured on LCM35 and LBM35 during two-step thermochemical treatments. Data collected on LSM35 under the same conditions are presented for comparison. When compared to LCM50 and LBM50, LCM35 and LBM35 show both significant decrease of the O2 productions associated with thermal reduction and increase of the re-oxidation yields associated with CO2 dissociation. This strongly suggests that upon La3+ enrichment, both compounds undergo a significant decrease of ΔG0ox. Such behavior is reminiscent of the La1−xSrxMnO3−δ series where ΔG0ox increases with x.26 Replacement of Sr2+ by the isovalent Ca2+ and Ba2+ seems to result in a similar trend, most probably due to the fact that the formal Mn oxidation state increases with x, easing oxidation for large La3+ contents, and reciprocally easing reduction for large Ae2+ contents in La1−xAexMnO3−δ compounds (where Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba).
 Fig. 3  (a) O2 production rates derived from the TGA data for LCM35 and LBM35. LSM35 is presented as a reference for comparison. (b) TGA of the same samples during reduction at 1400 °C under Ar followed by exposure to CO2 at 1050 °C (two cycles). 
Nevertheless, for x = 0.35 in La1−xAexMnO3−δ, a noticeable difference between Ae = Ca, Ba and Ae = Sr is observed. Enhanced thermal reduction is observed with Ae = Ca, Ba, associated with poorer re-oxidation yields, whereas LSM35 undergoes a re-oxidation that is almost total (re-oxidation yield of 94% during the second cycle). Moreover, a decrease of the activation energy was observed for thermal reduction of LCM35 and LBM35 (Fig. SI4†), with respectively 129 and 141 kJ mol−1, as opposed to 158 and 174 kJ mol−1 for LCM50 and LBM50 respectively. Such features could be associated with the presence of a significant hyper-stoichiometry for x = 0.35 in the case of Ca2+ and Ba2+. Compounds of the form La1−xAexMnO3−δ (δ < 0) have indeed been reported by several authors for x < 0.5,34,44,45 where the oxygen hyper-stoichiometry is believed to arise from La3+ and Ae2+ cation vacancies since the perovskite crystal structure provides no crystallographic site for interstitial O2− anions. On one hand, Rørmark et al. showed that this non-stoichiometry was slightly higher and persists for larger x for Ae = Ca than for Ae = Sr (it is indeed almost negligible after x = 0.3 for Sr).44 On the other hand, to our knowledge, no report has been dedicated to a careful measure of the oxygen hyper-stoichiometry for Ae = Ba as a function of x, but the fact that stoichiometric La1−xBaxMnO3 could be obtained by Dabrowski et al.45 only after treatment under inert atmosphere or quenching from above 1000 °C suggests that significant hyper-stoichiometry is present until at least x = 0.24. Since it has also been shown that ΔG0ox undergoes an abrupt increase in La1−xSrxMnO3−δ when δ < 0,26i.e. when cation vacancies have to be created in order to generate the hyper-stoichiometric compounds, the hypothesis of a larger hyper-stoichiometry for Ae = Ca2+, Ba2+ could well explain the poorer re-oxidation yields when compared to Ae = Sr2+. It would also be in agreement with the lower activation energies for reduction of LCM35 and LBM35 when compared to LCM50 and LBM50, due to an easier departure of the excess oxygen from the crystal framework.
It should be noted that CO productions exceeding 200 μmol g−1 were reported in LSM35,11 albeit with a higher reduction temperature (1500 °C) enabling to enhance thermal reduction and therefore re-incorporate more oxygen during the CO2 splitting step. Under the conditions used here, LSM35 shows CO productions of 189 and 198 μmol g−1 at 1050 °C during the first and second cycle, respectively.27 LCM35 displays similar productions with 183 and 188 μmol g−1. As was observed for LCM50 and LBM50, the slightly smaller productions of 163 and 159 μmol g−1 observed in LBM35 result from the larger molar mass of Ba when compared to Ca rather than from enhanced redox activity of the Ca-containing perovskite.

Fig. 4 summarizes the results concerning the re-oxidation yields (Fig. 4a), O2 productions and CO productions (Fig. 4b) observed during two thermochemical cycles under the same conditions for YSM50, LCM35, LCM50, LBM35, and LBM50. In order to ensure consistency between the first and second cycle, the re-oxidation yields were calculated based not only on the oxygen lost in the previous reduction step, but based on the total amount of oxygen lost and re-incorporated from the first cycle. LCM50 and LBM50 exhibit significant decrease of the CO production after the first thermochemical cycle, whereas these are more stable in the case of LCM35, LBM35 and YSM50. Thus, the largest CO production after one cycle is observed in LCM50 (210 μmol g−1), whereas it is observed in LCM35 after two cycles (188 μmol g−1). Deterioration of the re-oxidation yield has previously been described in other materials39 and was assigned to sintering of the polycrystalline samples (yielding both powder densification and mass transfer limitation of gaseous reactant in the sample). SEM images collected before (Fig. 5a) and after the thermochemical treatment (Fig. 5b) on the LCM50 sample – which suffers from the largest alteration of performance in term of CO production, along with LBM50 – clearly confirm this feature. A large growth of the particles is observed after two cycles which should lower both the specific surface area of the powder and gas diffusion throughout the packed sample, therefore decreasing the re-oxidation yield.

 Fig. 5  Scanning electron micrographs of LCM50 samples (a) after the synthesis, and (b) after two thermochemical cycles. 
Control of the polycrystalline samples was also systematically performed by powder X-ray diffraction after the thermochemical treatments (Fig. SI5†). LCM35, LCM50, LBM35 and LBM50 show excellent chemical stability toward the cycles of reduction and re-oxidation under CO2, and no impurities could be detected after the two-step treatments. For YSM50, traces of the hexagonal phase YMnO3 could be detected after the thermochemical treatment, whilst a large majority of the sample retains the original perovskite structure (Fig. SI5†). Since no other impurity was detected, this implies a slight enrichment and impoverishment of the respective Sr2+ and Y3+ content in the perovskite phase, to compensate for the loss of Y3+ due to the formation of YMnO3, according to the following reaction (which only accounts for the cationic repartition between the hexagonal and the perovskite phase, and does not consider the oxygen loss associated to the two-step cycle):Y0.50Sr0.50MnO3 → (1 − x)Y(0.50−x)/(1−x)Sr0.50/(1−x)MnO3 + xYMnO3
It is likely that the small amount of pure Mn3+-containing YMnO3 is formed during the thermal reduction, upon partial reduction of Mn4+ into Mn3+. The better stability of LCM35, LCM50, LBM35 and LBM50 when compared to YSM50 may be rationalized in term of relative Goldschmidt tolerance factors of these perovskites. The lower tolerance factor in YSM50 provokes a strong distortion of the perovskite structure, which may therefore be less flexible toward thermal reduction, as Mn4+ replacement by Mn3+ results in an even lower tolerance factor. Conversely, it should be noted that the low tolerance factor is directly responsible for YMnO3 crystallizing in a hexagonal structure instead of a perovskite structure. Formation of a slight amount of the stable YMnO3 phase allows for Sr2+ enrichment in the perovskite phase, increasing the average A-site radius, and therefore yielding a more favorable tolerance factor, implying less severe distortion of the perovskite structure during the reduction and resulting into more structural flexibility toward reduction.
In term of CO production, the performances of all these A-site substituted materials compare favorably to CeO2, which produces approximately 100 μmol g−1 under similar conditions.39 These better performances mainly lie on more favorable reduction thermodynamics for the perovskites studied here, which in turn results in larger oxygen re-incorporation during the CO2 dissociation step, despite poorer re-oxidation yields when compared to CeO2. LSM50 and LCM50 produce approximately the same amount of CO as Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (synthesized via Pechini method) under the same conditions.39
B-site substituted perovskites

Fig. 6 shows PXRD patterns of La1−xSrxMnO3−δ samples that were substituted on the B-site with Al3+ and Mg2+. Both cations have distinct chemistries, as can be illustrated with their distinct charge and size. Indeed, while LSM50 could be easily substituted with 0.25Al3+ per f.u. (La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.75Al0.25O3−δ: LSM-Al25), the solubility limit for Mg2+ into LSM50 was found to be approximately 0.15 (La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.85Mg0.15O3−δ: LSM-Mg15) under our synthesis conditions. Attempts to substitute Mn in LSM50 with 0.20 or 0.25Mg2+ per f.u. led to the observation of MgO impurity in the PXRD patterns after several cycles of grinding and firing at 1500 °C. It was found that decreasing the Sr2+ content allowed easier incorporation of Mg2+ into the perovskite, hence the synthesis of La0.6Sr0.4Mn0.83Mg0.17O3−δ (LSM-Mg17) and LaMn0.67Mg0.33O3−δ (LM-Mg) that display poorer strontium content than LSM50. Additionally, La0.6Sr0.4Mn0.6Al0.4O3−δ (LSM-Al40) and La0.6Sr0.4Mn0.4Al0.6O3−δ (LSM-Al60), for which good thermochemical performances have been reported by McDaniel et al.24 were synthesized in order to obtain comparison with our samples within the same thermochemical conditions. These different compositions result in Mg- and Al-substituted compounds with various La/Sr ratios.
 Fig. 6  PXRD patterns collected for LM-Mg, LSM-Mg17, LSM-Mg15, LSM-Al60, LSM-Al40, and LSM-Al25 samples. 
The PXRD patterns collected for these samples were characteristic of the ABO3 perovskite structures. As in the case of A-site substitutions, different crystal symmetries were observed, and since not all of these compounds are reported in the PXRD patterns database, indexation and LeBail fits were also undertaken in order to ensure that weak perovskite superstructure peaks were not actually arising from impurities (Fig. SI6†). The results from this analysis are summarized in Table 3. Different crystal symmetries were found for these compounds, in agreement with the evolution of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor. The sequence Pnma → Rc → I4/mcm → Pmm is observed as the tolerance factor varies from 0.967 (LM-Mg) to 1.030 (LSM-Al60). Due to charge balance reasons, both Al3+ and Mg2+ are expected to substitute for Mn3+ rather than Mn4+ and therefore, at an equal La/Sr ratio, Al3+ introduction tends to decrease the volume per f.u. due to a smaller ionic radius, while Mg2+ incorporation has the opposite effect owing to a larger ionic radius. At this equal La/Sr ratio, one should also note that Mg2+ incorporation tends to promote the formation of unit cells with lower symmetry, whereas Al3+ tends to favor higher symmetries when compared to the Al and Mg-free compounds in the La1−xSrxMnO3−δ series,46 as a result of the respectively lower and larger tolerance factor thus obtained.

Thermochemical CO2-splitting performance characterizations were performed for all B-site substituted La1−xSrxMnO3−δ perovskites by TGA. Full thermochemical cycles are presented in the ESI (Fig. SI7†), along with details on the re-oxidation steps (Fig. SI8†) and on the activation energy calculations (Fig. SI9†). Fig. 7 shows the O2 production rates (Fig. 7a), re-oxidation yields (Fig. 7b), and the O2 and CO productions calculated during the first (Fig. 7c) and second (Fig. 7d) thermochemical cycles. As previously reported for the La1−xSrxMnO3−δ series,27 Sr substitution clearly enhances the reduction extent in the B-site substituted compounds. Accordingly, a limited O2 release was observed for the pure La-containing LM-Mg, which in turn yields poor CO productions. Activation energies were found to be 164, 159, 89, 115, 119, and 35 kJ mol−1 for LSM-Al25, LSM-Al40, LSM-Mg15, LSM-Mg17, and LM-Mg respectively. Overall, Sr-doped compounds display similar redox performances, which result in both elevated O2 and CO productions despite the partial re-oxidations. Particularly, during the second cycle, these compounds display CO productions that are similar to that observed in LSM50 under the same conditions. Al-doped compounds were reported to show large CO productions over one thermochemical cycle, with 294 μmol g−1 for LSM-Al40 and 247 μmol g−1 for LSM-Al60.24 Under our thermochemical conditions, 196 μmol g−1 and 279 μmol g−1 were respectively observed for the same compositions. Such variations may be attributed to a variety of parameters, such as sample microstructure, different pO2 and temperatures applied during the series of experiments. Upon our synthesis and reaction conditions, the Al-doped compounds do not show any significant enhancement of the reactivity when compared to the pure Mn-containing LSM35 and LSM50. This may be a result of the loss of redox active Mn cations that are replaced by Al3+ (Al incorporation reduces the amount of reducible Mn cation on B-site). Moreover, the productions observed with the most performant Al-doped compounds were dramatically lowered after two cycles, probably due to a strong influence of sintering, notably with LSM-Al60 which displays a decrease of the re-oxidation yield from 57% to 35% after two cycles. Such decrease of the re-oxidation yield was not reported by McDaniel et al. who presented only one cycle for three Al-containing materials.24 However, cycling of one of their Al-doped material, albeit with shorter reaction time, showed CO productions not exceeding 150 μmol g−1, for a sample producing 286 μmol g−1 over one cycle. Deactivation of the Al-containing samples after the first cycle may therefore also be presumed in this case.

(b) Re-oxidation yields with the first and second bars corresponding for each sample to the first and second cycle respectively. (c) O2 and CO productions during the first cycle. (d) O2 and CO productions during the second cycle. 
Systematic control of the samples evolution after the thermochemical treatments was performed by PXRD. Fig. SI10† shows that all B-site substituted samples remain single phase perovskites, confirming the chemical stability of these compounds during thermal reduction followed by CO2 splitting. Whereas strong variations of the CO productions and re-oxidation yields could be observed from the first to second cycles for the Al-substituted materials, greater stability of the production was observed with Mg-substituted compounds. In particular, the LSM-Mg17 compound shows the largest CO production after two cycles when compared to other B-site doped LSM compounds. Fig. 8 shows SEM images that were collected before and after identical thermochemical cycles on samples of LSM35 (Fig. 8a and b), LSM50 (Fig. 8c and d) and LSM-Mg17 (Fig. 8e and f). LSM35 and LSM50 were synthesized at 1450 °C, whereas LSM-Mg17 was synthesized at 1500 °C. Comparable grain sizes are observed in LSM35 and LSM50 before and after thermochemical characterizations. Remarkably, LSM-Mg17 shows a dramatically smaller particle size, with some grains being one order of magnitude smaller than some observed in LSM35 and LSM50. Loosely packed aggregates of these particles enable formation of an irregular framework of open pores. Such architecture is retained after two thermochemical cycles, showing the good resistance to sintering of the Mg-substituted sample. Mg2+ incorporation into LSM materials could therefore have a beneficial effect for sintering resistance both during synthesis (in order to achieve smaller grain size) and thermochemical treatments (in order to obtain thermal and chemical performance stability). That feature may be correlated with the generally strong Mg–O bonding energy in oxides, which for example results in a melting point of 2852 °C for MgO.
 Fig. 8  Scanning electron micrographs of LSM35, LSM50, and LSM-Mg17 samples after the synthesis and after two thermochemical cycles. 
With the aim to enhance the CO productions of LaMnO3 based perovskites, LSM50 was shown to be close to the optimal Sr-doping.27 Therefore, LSM-Mg17 represents one of the most promising materials studied here, as it offers performances that are comparable to LSM50, with respective productions of 207 and 215 μmol g−1 after the second cycle under the same conditions, while it offers a greater resistance to sintering and then should be less sensitive toward deactivation upon long term cycling. Various temperatures of re-oxidation were investigated for this material and a third cycle was performed at 1050 °C in order to evaluate the deactivation process past the first thermochemical cycle. The full thermochemical treatment is shown in Fig. SI11† and the CO productions as a function of the temperature and of the cycle number are depicted on Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  CO productions obtained with LSM-Mg17 as a function of the temperature of re-oxidation with CO2. The same reduction temperature of 1400 °C was applied for all cycles. 
Based on the isothermal re-oxidation experiments at various temperatures and the corresponding peak reaction rates, the activation energy for the re-oxidation process of LSM-Mg17 by CO2 was found to be 39 kJ mol−1 (using Arrhenius law). Interestingly, a greater CO production is observed when the re-oxidation is performed at 1200 °C, that reaches 239 μmol g−1, whereas a steep decrease is observed at 900 °C, with 169 μmol g−1. Since the thermodynamics of re-oxidation are generally favored by a temperature decrease, the larger CO productions observed at higher temperatures are likely to be a result of the enhancement of thermally activated processes such as catalytic CO2 dissociation and oxide ion bulk diffusion. The greater redox performances produced by enhancement of the kinetics at higher re-oxidation temperatures is practically a very interesting feature in order to diminish the temperature shift needed to perform two-step thermochemical splitting of CO2. For instance, a temperature shift of approximately 400 °C or higher is generally needed to make profit of the good redox performances of ceria-based materials. In the case of LSM-Mg17, this shift could be reduced to 200 °C, potentially resulting in a more efficient use of solar energy input, with less time dedicated to the cooling and heating of the solar reactor. In addition, the third re-oxidation performed at 1050 °C showed good reproducibility with the second re-oxidation at the same temperature, in term of both kinetics and magnitude of the CO production. The respective CO productions were indeed 208 and 215 μmol g−1 after the second and third CO2 splitting steps performed at 1050 °C, with a similar profile in term of kinetics (Fig. 9). Note that the initial re-oxidation kinetics was faster during the first cycle at 1050 °C but the same final CO production was reached. Since no evidence of decomposition was observed after the thermochemical treatments, such result suggests that the sample microstructure is mostly impacted by the first cycle, allowing for better cycling of the kinetics and the CO production past this point.
Conclusion
A- and B-site substituted perovskites derived from the La1−xSrxMnO3−δ series were synthesized and their reactivity toward two-step thermochemical CO2 splitting was subsequently studied. Significant CO productions were observed for the majority of the compounds as most of them display redox activities that are comparable to state of the art ceria and substituted ceria in term of CO production. The best performances after two cycles were observed in the case of the B-site substitution with Mg2+ for La0.60Sr0.40Mn0.83Mg0.17O3−δ (LSM-Mg17). Substitution of Sr2+ by other alkaline earth cations Ca2+ and Ba2+ leads to a similar behavior and redox activity of manganese resulting in large CO productions. In contrast, the incorporation of Y3+ in place of La3+ enhances oxygen vacancy formation in the perovskite and the decrease of the thermal reduction temperature may be achieved by this type of substitution. However, this might be associated with larger standard Gibbs free enthalpy of oxidation which is not beneficial to the CO2 splitting step. The B-site substitution of Al3+ for Mn3+ was found to promote the best performances during the first thermochemical cycle. However, a strong decrease of the CO production was observed after this first cycle, indicating poorer thermal stability when compared to undoped La1−xSrxMnO3−δ compounds. In contrast, upon Mg2+ introduction on the B-site, strong thermal stability was observed for LSM-Mg17 and this material maintains CO productions that surpass 200 μmol g−1 after three thermochemical cycles. Moreover, SEM images confirm that Mg2+ incorporation could be highly beneficial for thermal stability in the La1−xSrxMnO3−δ series and could favor a decrease of the particle size, therefore increasing the surface area available for the interfacial solid-gas reaction inherent to the CO2 splitting step. Thus, Mg2+ introduction allows retaining thermochemical performances while increasing thermal stability and enhancing resistance to sintering, and could therefore be considered to induce such effects in other perovskite systems applied to high temperature solar-driven thermochemistry.
