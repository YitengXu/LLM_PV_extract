    , Accepted 18th September 2020First published on 21st September 2020AbstractConsidering the key role of electron donors to the intramolecular charge transfer of organic dyes, molecular arrangement and electron processes in dye-sensitized solar cells, four organic dyes (LI-133–136) were designed and synthesized with indolo[3,2-b]indole (IDID) as the main electron donor and various aromatics as the assistant ones. The broad light response was achieved by the strong electron-donating ability of IDID with a planar structure, and with the aid of the electron-rich property of carbazole and triphenylamine. Moreover, the twisted configuration and large size of triphenylamine on the head of dye LI-136 can be beneficial to suppressing dye aggregation and electron recombination, contributing to the improved photovoltaic performance. With the systematic investigation of their photophysical and electrochemical impedance properties, together with theoretical calculations, the electronic characteristics of IDID and the spatial configuration of triphenylamine were highlighted as a synergy effect on the photovoltaic performance, affording an efficient strategy to simultaneously enhance the light-harvesting property and suppress the charge recombination.
Introduction
Conversion of sunlight into electrical energy is considered as an effective way to solve the energy crisis and environmental problems. In the photoelectric conversion process, dyes play an essential role to light harvesting and electron transitions in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs).1–3 For example, porphyrins and their analogues draw intense attention due to their excellent absorption in the visible wavelength range and high conversion efficiencies.4–8 As for the metal-free organic sensitizers, the planar molecular configurations of organic dyes with strong electronic pull-push structures can increase the intramolecular charge transfer, resulting in the broad absorption spectra and strong light-harvesting abilities, which are beneficial to the photovoltaic performance.9–12 However, the strong dipole–dipole and π–π interactions among these dyes usually cause severe aggregates on the TiO2 surface, leading to the charge recombination, which is detrimental to the photoelectric conversion process with energy loss.13 Thus, the adjustment of electronic characteristics and spatial configurations of organic dyes is essential to optimizing the photovoltaic performance of solar cells.
For the common organic dyes with D–π–A structures, electron donors (D) act as the “electronic warehouse” and continuously transfer electrons from the π bridge to the acceptor (A). They also play an important role in regulating the arrangement of organic dyes on the TiO2 surface, with the aim to suppress electron recombination and facilitate dye regeneration from the redox shuttle.14–18 As to the dye arrangements, the electron donors with large sizes and twisted configurations can act as isolated groups to enlarge the distances between the conjugation skeletons of organic dyes by steric hindrance, and suppress the dye aggregation in most cases. The dye arrangement also can affect the electron processes at the interface. For instance, the severe dye aggregation could lead to the inhomogeneous distribution of organic dyes on the TiO2 surface, resulting in the electron recombination at the bare TiO2 surface. Alternatively, the regular molecular packing is beneficial to forming a compact barrier layer to suppress the possible electron recombination. Until now, various electron donors have been exploited, such as carbazole,19,20 indoline21,22 and triphenylamine,23–25 from which emerged the nitrogen atom as the electron-rich unit in different conjugated systems. Recently, Wang et al. designed an organic dye C279 containing N-annulated perylene as the electron donor with a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8%, which can further increase to 13% by the expansion of a fused-heterocycle donor system (Fig. S1, ESI†).26 In addition, compared to the common carbazole-based dyes, the indolocarbazole-based ones exhibited increased conversion efficiency, further confirming the advantage of expanded conjugated systems with rigid structures as electron donors (Fig. S2, ESI†).27 These moieties can decrease the vibrational relaxation of organic molecules with less energy loss, and increase the intramolecular charge transfer, favouring the fast electron injection and broad light-harvesting region.
Considering these properties and based on the strong electron-donating ability of the TAPP moiety as proven by our previous study (Fig. 1),28 the indolo[3,2-b]indole (IDID) unit with planar and rigid structure was designed and synthesized, which can be illustrated by the decreased dihedral angles between pyrrolopyrrole and phenyl units from 30° (TAPP) to nearly zero (IDID). The fused ring can increase the effective conjugation length and decrease the reorganization energy, favouring the efficient charge transfer along the D–π–A direction. Furthermore, an auxiliary donor (D′) with different electronic properties and spatial stereo structures was modified on the head of the IDID moiety to form a new D′–D–π–A system. As shown in Fig. 1, dyes LI-133–LI-136 bearing benzene, fluorine, carbazole and triphenylamine as the D′ moieties were synthesized by gradually increasing the electron-donating abilities and steric hindrance, which can promote the intramolecular charge transfer and adjust molecular configurations. All of the sensitizers exhibited the broad absorption region, and PCEs of the corresponding solar cells gradually increased with the auxiliary electron donors changed from benzene to triphenylamine. This is mainly related to the synergy effect of triphenylamine and the IDID moieties as dual electron donors with suitable spatial configurations and electronic characteristics. Herein, the photophysical properties, electrochemical properties, and photovoltaic properties of these four dyes will be discussed in detail, and some relationship between the molecular structures and photovoltaic performance has been proposed.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and design of organic dyes
The synthetic routes of the organic dyes are depicted in Scheme 1. Through the Sonogashira coupling reaction, the IDID moiety was obtained with a moderate yield according to literature.29 After the alkylation of the IDID unit with branched alky chains, different auxiliary electron donors were easily introduced by the Suzuki coupling reaction. The target organic dyes were obtained by Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid as the electron acceptor and anchoring group, and have been fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, ESI and EA (Fig. S4–S20, ESI†).

Theoretical calculations
With the aim to predict and investigate the influence of the molecular configuration and electronic properties of organic dyes on the photovoltaic performance, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation at the B3LYP/6-31G* level was conducted (Fig. 2).30 It was found that the HOMOs of these dyes mainly focus on the IDID moiety. This revealed that the IDID core acted as the efficient electron donor, and they varied subtly with different auxiliary electron donors. For benzene and fluorene with weak electron-donating capabilities, a small electron distribution of HOMOs extended to these moieties. However, if these are replaced by triphenylamine and carbazole moieties, the electron distribution of HOMOs can cover these auxiliary electron donors. This means that they can efficiently participate in the intramolecular charge transfer. The electron acceptor parts of these dyes are the same, and the LUMOs were mainly located on the cyanoacetic acid and thiophene moieties. The partial overlap of the HOMOs and LUMOs is conducive to an intramolecular electron transfer from the electron donor to acceptor moieties. Additionally, their calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels are shown in Table 1, which were consistent with the UV-Vis absorption spectra and electrochemical properties (Fig. 3).

Photophysical properties
The UV/Vis absorption spectra of these organic dyes in dilute dichloromethane and anchored on TiO2 films (6.6 μm) are shown in Fig. 3. Their maxima wavelengths (λmaxs) of absorption and absorption onsets (λonsets) are summarized in Table 1. These IDID-based organic dyes displayed red-shifted absorption compared with that of LI-128 (λmax = 506 nm) with TAPP as the electron donor (Fig. S3, ESI†). This indicates that the formation of the IDID core can promote the charge transfer more efficiently for the rigid structure with planar configuration. Upon adsorption on the TiO2 film, their absorption spectra exhibited broad light harvesting regions ranging from 300 nm to 700 nm. This is mainly attributed to the interactions between TiO2 and the organic dyes, together with the molecule–molecule interactions in the aggregated state.31–33 Either in solution or on the TiO2 film, the absorption spectra of LI-135 and LI-136 are slightly red-shifted with respect to those of LI-133 and LI-134. It is mainly due to the stronger electron-donating ability of the triphenylamine and carbazole moieties, favouring the intramolecular charge transfer with stronger electronic pull-push effect. The enhanced light harvesting across the wide spectrum could possibly facilitate DSCs to produce large photocurrents.
Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry was performed for these organic dyes to determine their redox potentials, and the corresponding HOMO and LUMO levels (Fig. 3c). The first oxidation potentials (Eoxs) are related to the IDID unit as the electron donor (0.71–0.80 V vs. NHE), corresponding to the HOMO levels. They were significantly more positive than that of the liquid electrolyte I−/I3− redox potential (0.4 V vs. NHE), indicating the suitable energy staircase for dye regeneration.34 The second oxidation potentials may relate to the assistant electron donors and π bridges, and the strong electron-donating ability of the triphenylamine unit can be further confirmed by the smallest Eox. The excited state oxidation potentials Eox* (−1.21 to −1.16 V vs. NHE), corresponding to the LUMO level, were estimated from Eox and the zero–zero transition energy (E0–0). They were found to be more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (ECB, −0.5 V vs. NHE), implying a thermodynamically favoured electron injection from the excited dye to TiO2 (Fig. 3d).35 Thus, compounds LI-133–LI-136 can act as efficient organic dyes for the well-matched energy levels with TiO2 and the electrolyte.
Photovoltaic performance
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves and IPCE plots of DSCs based on LI-133–LI-136 were conducted with an iodine electrolyte (0.05 M I2, 0.2 M LiI, 0.6 M DMPII, 0.1 M GuNCS and 0.5 M 4-TBP in acetonitrile) under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (Fig. 4). The photovoltaic parameters of DSCs based on dyes LI-133–LI-136 are displayed in Table 2 and Fig. S4 (ESI†). The DSC based on dye LI-133 with benzene as the D′ unit showed a PCE of 6.71% (Jsc = 14.56 mA cm−2, Voc = 672 mV, FF = 0. 69). When the D′ moiety was changed to a fluorene unit, the improved photovoltaic performance of dye LI-134 was achieved with a conversion efficiency of 7.03%. This might be related to the larger size of fluorene with the bigger steric effect on the suppression of the possible electron recombination.36–39 Furthermore, dye LI-135 with carbazole as the assistant electron-donating unit exhibited a further increased conversion efficiency of 8.09%. This is because the electron-rich unit of carbazole can promote light harvesting by increasing the intramolecular charge transfer. However, the planar structure of carbazole and IDID could induce the dye aggregates to some extent, as proven by the increased dye-loading amount (1.78 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1). Thus, triphenylamine as a strong electron donor with twisted configuration was incorporated into dye LI-136. The resultant decreased dye-loading amount (1.18 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1) was obtained with the suppression of dye aggregates on the TiO2 film by the large steric hindrance of triphenylamine. The highest conversion efficiency of 8.34% was achieved with a Jsc of 16.75 mA cm−2, Voc of 705 mV, and FF of 0.71. The high Jsc value was related to the dual electron-donating effect of IDID and triphenylamine on the intramolecular charge transfer and absorption spectra. In addition, the electronic effect by carbazole and triphenylamine as efficient assistant electron donors can be further proven by the broader IPCE curves ranging from 300 to 750 nm (Fig. 4b), which are consistent with the trend of Jsc and UV-Vis absorption spectra on the TiO2 film. Thus, the optimized photovoltaic performance of dye LI-136 was due to the synergy effect of suitable electronic characteristics and spatial configuration of the dual electron donors. In addition, the spatial configuration was not only related to the dye arrangement, but also the electron process at the interface. Triphenylamine, with its large size and twisted configuration, can act as the isolated group to enlarge the distance between the conjugation skeleton of the organic dye by steric hindrance, and suppress the dye aggregation. It can be partially proved by the lowest dye-loading amounts of LI-136. The related electron process at the interface can be investigated by electrochemical analysis.

The method of charge extraction (CE) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) were applied to investigate and understand the energetics and dynamic origins of the different Voc in detail. Actually, the theoretical maximum attainable Voc of a DSC is limited by the difference between the quasi-Fermi level (EF,n) of the electrons in the oxide semiconductor and the potential of the redox shuttle in the electrolyte.40–42 This is because the related DSCs were fabricated with the same electrolyte (I3−/I−). Voc is mainly determined by the quasi-Fermi-level (EF,n), which is affected by two main factors: (i) the position of the TiO2 conduction band, which could be inferred from the charge extraction (CE) method; (ii) the electron density in the semiconductor, which is mainly controlled by the interfacial recombination rate of the electrons in TiO2 with an oxidized substance in the electrolyte and/or dye cations. This can be analysed by IMVS measurement and is reflected in the electron lifetime (τ).43 As shown in Fig. 5, the four dyes of LI-133–LI-136 displayed an inconspicuous shifts in ECB, which is probably due to their similar dipole moments with the similar skeleton of sensitizers. However, LI-133 and LI-134 exhibited the shorter electron lifetime, which means the higher electron recombination rate of I3− or cations with the electrons injected into the TiO2 film, resulting in the lower Voc of about 672 mV. As displayed in Fig. 5b, the lifetime values lie in the order of LI-136 > LI-135 > LI-134 > LI-133, which is in good agreement with the trend of Voc. Thus, the auxiliary electron donors with spatial configurations can optimize the dye arrangement on the TiO2 surface, and act as the efficient barrier layer to inhibit the contact of the electrolyte with the electrons in the TiO2 film. Despite the low dye-loading of LI-136 in this case, the higher conversion efficiency of DSC was achieved for the preferred molecular arrangement on the TiO2 surface. It is beneficial to the suppression of the charge recombination, further confirming the key role of the spatial configurations of the electron donors.

Accordingly, in order to investigate the interfacial charge transfer in devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the dark under a forward bias of −0.69 V. The Nyquist and Bode phase plots for DSCs based on the four sensitizers are presented in Fig. 5c and d. The interfacial charge transfer resistances (RCT) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface are closely related to the larger semicircle at lower frequencies in the Nyquist plots. As the RCT decreases, the charge recombination occurs faster. At a given voltage bias, the corresponding radius of the semicircle is in the order of LI-136 > LI-135 > LI-134 > LI-133, indicating that the charge recombination between the electrons in TiO2 and the redox electrolyte was restrained well by the auxiliary electron donors with tunable configurations. The large size of triphenylamine with its twisted structures is beneficial to the well-organized molecular arrangement and formation of the contact inhibitor, resulting in the largest RCT value. The electron lifetime of the devices in the dark condition was correlated with the frequency in the Bode phase plots (Fig. 5d), which is also in agreement with the result from IMVS measurements. Additionally, the co-sensitization with CDCA has been conducted. Although the Voc values slightly increased with the addition of CDCA, all of the dyes exhibited decreased conversion efficiencies for the competitive adsorption of CDCA, resulting in the decrease of the dye-loading amounts and Jsc values.
 Fig. 6  The proposed mechanism for the function of the dual electron donors with synergy effect. 
Thus, with the incorporation of the assistant electron donors and the relation design of the electron donor moieties, the optimized photovoltaic performance of dye LI-136 is achieved by the synergy effect of the electronic characteristics and spatial configuration of dual electron donors. The electronic effect is mainly from the strong electron-donating ability of the IDID moiety with planar structures, which can strengthen the intramolecular charge transfer to improve the light-harvesting ability. In addition, the electron-rich property of the assistant electron donors can further broaden the absorption spectra and IPCE curves. The spatial configuration was mainly constructed by the twisted geometry of triphenylamine, which can suppress the dye aggregates as the isolated group, resulting in the preferred molecular arrangement on the TiO2 surface (Fig. 6). Since the assistant electron donors are on the head of the organic dyes, the large size of triphenylamine can favour the formation of an efficient barrier layer to inhibit the possible charge recombination between the electrolyte and electrons in the TiO2 film. These combined effects result in the high conversion efficiency of DSCs with less energy loss, and it gives an efficient strategy for the molecular design of organic dyes with excellent photovoltaic performance by the incorporation of dual electron donors with matched structures.
Conclusion
Organic dyes with dual electron donors have been designed and synthesized by the incorporation of IDID as the main electron donor with the aid of various aromatic systems. The strong electron-donating ability of IDID with planar structure can strengthen the intramolecular charge transfer to enhance the light-harvesting ability. Moreover, the improved photovoltaic performance can be gradually achieved by the increased steric effect of assistant electron donors. This is because their twisted configuration with large sizes can efficiently suppress the possible dye aggregates and charge recombination, once again demonstrating the importance of rational molecular design.44–50 Thus, dye LI-136 with IDID and triphenylamine as dual electron donors exhibited the highest conversion efficiency. The synergy effect of the electronic characteristics by IDID and the spatial configuration of triphenylamine was highlighted as the key factor, which provide an efficient way to promote the development of solar cells by the rational design of electron donors.
