    , Accepted 16th January 2021First published on 18th January 2021AbstractOptimizing the properties of carbon electrodes remains a critical challenge in the development of high-efficiency vanadium redox flow batteries. In this work, we correlate the battery performance with microstructures and surface chemistries through the controllable fabrication of perforated carbon platelets derived from metal–organic frameworks. With Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, we identify topological carbon defects and nitrogen-dopants as active sites for the oxidation of VO2+, as corroborated by the density functional theory. The optimal PCP electrode rich in these structural features is fabricated at a carbonization temperature of 800 °C to provide high electrical conductivity and a large surface area. It delivers energy efficiencies of 82.0 and 69.7% at current densities of 200 and 400 mA cm−2, respectively in a VRFB, along with high cycling stability. Further dissection of the polarization resistance confirms the catalytic activity as the underlying reason for the outstanding performance.
Introduction
Intermittent solar and wind energies require large-scale energy storage, which must be safe, durable, and most importantly, cost-effective.1–4 While many conventional storage technologies strive to meet the needs, redox flow batteries are emerging with a high promise.5–7 This system separates energy storage and power generation to satisfy various demands, in particular, the demand for long-duration storage.8,9 The most mature type of the system is based on vanadium ions. Vanadium-based redox flow batteries (VRFBs) employ the redox couples of VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ on positive and negative sides, respectively.10–13 They operate in aqueous electrolytes with an inherently high safety and their convenient rebalancing strategy enables a long cycle life. Extensive research has been ongoing to improve their performance and large-scale demonstrations have been set up to prove their potential.
The design of carbon electrodes remains one of the biggest challenges in the development of efficient, cost-effective VRFBs.14,15 Though not the energy storage media, electrodes determine the power density and the energy efficiency of a RFB, and thus the number of the battery stacks at a given rated power, which accounts for a significant fraction of the overall cost of the system. Commercial carbon paper and graphite felt are the most common electrodes for VRFBs but their properties are far from being optimal.16–18 In particular, the poor catalytic activity and unfavorable electrode structure have limited the current and power outputs of VRFBs. In this regard, much recent work has been dedicated to addressing these issues by designing novel carbon electrodes. One strategy is functional modifications by incorporating edge sites or defects,19 functional groups,20 and heteroatoms into the carbon matrix,21,22 which can significantly boost the reaction kinetics. For example, graphene-nanowall decorated carbon felt was fabricated by microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition.23 Abundant graphene edges sites were exposed so as to achieve excellent catalytic activity in the redox conversion of vanadium ions. In other studies on carbon electrodes, nitrogen-doped carbon spheres anchored on graphite felt presented an energy efficiency (EE) of 53% at a current density of 300 mA cm−2,24 and nitrogen-doped graphite felt derived from polypyrrole exhibited an EE of 74.2% at 150 mA cm−2 in VRFBs.25 Nitrogen/phosphorus dual-doped carbon electrodes fabricated by the pyrolysis of cross-linked polymers delivered an EE of 70.4% at 250 mA cm−2.26 Another approach is structural engineering, ranging from the design of porous structures to constructing complex interfaces.12,27 For instance, FeOOH nanorods were employed as sacrificial templates to engrave numerous pores on graphite felt, resulting in an increased EE of 57.3% at 300 mA cm−2.28 A holey three-dimensional carbon electrode was derived from wood, which had ameliorated battery performance arising from the unique structure with aligned channels and small holes for fast ion exchange and electrolyte penetration.29 A gradient graphene hybrid electrode with one side enriched with oxygenated functional groups for electrocatalysis and the other side facilitating electron transfer was also fabricated, which endowed the assembled VRFBs with an enhanced EE of 87% at 50 mA cm−2.27
Despite all the performance improvements, much work is needed to establish clear structure–property relationships for proper design of RFB electrodes. The underlying issues are three folds. First, the improvements may be the convoluting results of multiple properties. For example, nanostructures in an electrode not only increase the specific surface area but also create catalytic defects. In contrast, doping with rich heteroatoms may benefit charge transfer kinetics but impair the electrical conductivity. Second, fabrication methods often allow limited structural tunability, without which it is difficult to identify the properties that control the performance. Third, there are limited mechanistic insights into the nature of active sites corroborated by both experiments and calculation.
Here, we propose a strategy to control the microstructures and functional doping of carbon electrodes through the carbonization of metal–organic framework (MOF) precursors deposited on graphite felt. By controlling the carbonization temperature, the structure and surface chemistry of carbon electrodes are tuned so as to optimize the ion/electron transfer, structural integrity, and the number of active sites for vanadium redox reactions. Physico-electrochemical characterization tools are used to identify topological nanocarbon defects and nitrogen dopants as active sites for vanadium redox reactions, which are further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The as-designed electrode delivers outstanding EEs at high current densities and a long cycle life.
Experimental
Fabrication of perforated carbon platelets (PCPs)
Commercial graphite felts (Liaoning Jingu Carbon Materials Co., Ltd., China) with a thickness of 2 mm were annealed at 500 °C in air for 5 h to enhance their hydrophilicity, denoted as thermally treated graphite felt (TGF). The fabrication process of cobalt embedded in carbon platelets was performed according to the literature with modifications.30 Specifically, 0.5 g cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Solution A) and 1.1 g 2-methylimidazole (Solution B) were separately dissolved in 35 mL deionized (DI) water and stirred for 0.5 h. Solution B was immediately poured into Solution A, and TGF (2 cm × 4 cm) was immersed in the mixture. After reaction for 4 h, the samples were taken out, washed with DI water to remove some impurities and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. The MOF precursors were annealed in a quartz tube furnace at 600, 700, 800, and 900 °C for 2 h under argon gas, respectively, with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. The Co@C samples were taken after cooling to room temperature. Finally, the as-prepared Co@C carbon platelets were immersed in 8 M HNO3 solution with stirring at 80 °C for 72 h to remove cobalt particles and cleaned with DI water three times and dried.
Materials characterization
The morphologies and microstructure of PCP electrodes were characterized by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM, JSM-6390) and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010). Their crystal phase and degree of graphitization were analyzed using an X-ray diffraction analyzer (XRD, PW 1830, Philips) and RM 3000 Micro Raman system (Renishaw PLC) with a 532 nm Ar laser. The electrical conductivities were measured by the four-point probe method. The surface chemistry was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5600, Physical Electronics) with an Al K excitation source at 14 kV. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm curves were obtained on an automated adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics, ASAP2460). The surface area and pore size distribution were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) analysis, respectively. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, 725-ES, Varian) was carried out to determine the etching content of cobalt ions in the solution. The electrolyte accessibility was measured on a goniometer (Dataphysics, OCA 20) to measure the contact angle.
Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation with a typical three-electrode system in a solution of 0.1 mol L−1 VO2+ + 3 mol L−1 H2SO4. The PCP electrodes or TGF served as the working electrode (1.0 × 1.0 cm2), along with a platinum mesh as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) electrodes as the reference electrode. The VRFB battery was assembled using a zero-gap serpentine flow-field. The PCP or TGF with a size of 2 × 2 cm2 was employed as the positive electrode while a TGF with the same size as the negative electrode. 1 M VO2+ + 3 M H2SO4 (25 mL) and 1 M V3+ + 3 M H2SO4 (25 mL) were prepared as positive and negative electrolytes, respectively, with a piece of Nafion® 212 (Dupont, USA) as the cation ion exchange membrane. The electrolytes were circulated using a two-channel peristaltic pump (Longer pump, WT600-2J) at a flow rate of 46 mL min−1. High-purity argon gas was bubbled before each test to exhaust the residual air in the electrolyte tanks. All the battery performance was evaluated on a Neware instrument with 1.65 V upper limit voltage in the charging process and 0.8 V cut-off voltage in the discharging process. The electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed on an electrochemical working station (BioLogic VMP3) with a 5 mV amplitude over a frequency range of 0.1–100 kHz.
Calculation methods
The electrostatic potential map (ESP) was adopted to predict possible VO2+ adsorption sites. In detail, the DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09W software package.31 The large polyaromatic hydrocarbon molecule cluster of C54H18 was built as the pristine model to represent graphene. The corresponding nitrogen dopants and defects were created based on this model. Geometrical optimization used the M062X method in the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set with the steered molecular dynamics solvent model (water). Based on the optimized structure, the ESP map analysis was performed on a van der Waals surface and its extreme point was calculated using the Multiwfn 3.7 software package.32 The adsorption behavior was simulated by the program package DMol3 implemented in Materials Studio (Accelrys, Inc.) using the double-numeric plus-polarization (DNP) function and a global orbital cutoff of 5.0 Å.33,34 The DFT calculations were carried out under the general gradient approximation using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional. The tolerances of energy, gradient, and displacement convergence were set to be 1.0 × 10−5 Ha, 0.002 Ha Å−1, and 0.005 Å, respectively. The slab models were constructed based on a monolayer graphite (001) surface in a 3 × 3 × 1 supercell and a vacuum layer of 20 Å along the z-direction was created to avoid self-interaction between the slabs. The reciprocal space was sampled on a Monkhorst–Pack 3 × 3 × 1 K-mesh. The force tolerance of self-consistent-field (SCF) cycles was 1.0 × 10−6. Grimme's DFT-D2 method was adopted to describe the van der Waals interactions along with using the COSMO solvent model (water). To avoid the inaccurate calculation of the charged system in the periodic structure, the VO moiety is used to replace the VO2+ ions. The adsorption energies of VO on different slab surfaces were calculated as follows: Eads = EVO+slab − EVO − Eslab, where EVO+slab and Eslab are the total energies of different slabs with and without adsorbed VO, respectively, and EVO is the energy of an isolated VO.
Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and characterization
The synthesis procedure of the TGF coated with perforated carbon platelets is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. A uniform layer of violet MOF film was first deposited on the TGF in four hours using cobalt ions as the metal center and 2-methylimidazole as the organic ligand (Fig. S1a†). The process is independent of the size of the electrode, indicating its scale-up potential. The MOF film, as characterized by the SEM, comprises platelets of a few hundred nanometers wide, grown uniformly on the fibers (Fig. S1b†). The MOF-coated TGF was then annealed in argon for carbonization. During this process, the 2-methylimidazole ligand is decomposed into nitrogen-doped carbon, while cobalt nitrate is reduced to metallic cobalt.30 After carbonization, the XRD peaks of the MOF at 2θ = 10–20° disappear (Fig. S2†). Instead, new peaks at 44.2°, 51.4°, and 75.5° emerge, corresponding to the (111), (200), and (220) crystalline planes of cubic Co (JCPDS no. 15-0806), respectively.35 The platelet morphology is retained after carbonization (Fig. S3†). TEM images show that Co nanoparticles are evenly distributed on the carbon matrix at a low carbonization temperature (Fig. S3b, d, f and h,†) while they grow into larger aggregates at a higher temperature. This temperature-dependent change allows the use of carbonization temperature to control the micro-/nanostructure of PCPs.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the fabrication processes of PCPs. 
Co particles were etched with nitric acid to introduce nanosized perforations in the platelets. We prepared four different materials carbonized at different temperatures, the final products of which are referred to herein as PCP-XXX, where XXX corresponds to the carbonization temperature in Celsius. ICP-OES was performed to determine how long the etching process was required. Accurate information is necessary because incomplete etching of PCP electrodes may lead to electrolyte contamination. As shown in Fig. 2a, the cobalt contents in the nitric acid see a marked increase in the first 4 h before stabilizing 68 h, along with the change of solution color from colorless to pink. Therefore, a dissolution time of 72 h was chosen to remove Co. The successful removal of Co is also confirmed by the XRD spectra (Fig. 2b). The Raman spectra and XPS reveal abundant defects and surface functional groups, whose amounts depend on carbonization temperature (Fig. 2c, S4 and Table S1†). Except PCP-600, which shows a characteristic peak of CoO due to the incomplete thermal reduction at low temperature,36 all other PCP samples display mainly two prominent peaks at 1350 and 1583 cm−1, attributed to the defect-induced D-band and graphitic G-band of carbon, respectively. The intensity ratio, ID/IG, of the two peaks decreases with increasing carbonization temperature, suggesting a reduction in defect density with a higher degree of graphitization.37 The same result can be observed from the XPS spectra. After deconvoluting the C 1s peaks into O–CO (290.0 eV), CO (287.6 eV), C–N/C–OH (285.8 eV), sp3 C–C (284.8 eV), sp2 CC units (284.4 eV) and vacancy defects (283.9 eV) (Fig. 2d), we can estimate a decreasing intensity ratio of vacancy to sp2 carbon with increasing carbonization temperature (Fig. 2g). This is caused by more frequent rearrangement of carbon atoms at high temperature.38 Along with the decrease of defect density and the removal of heteroatoms, however, the oxygen content does not decrease monotonically with the temperature, as the etching step also oxidizes carbon (Fig. 2h).39 The comparison of relative contents of these oxygenated functional groups indicates that the C–CO species are dominant (Fig. 2e). The N 1s peak consists of pyridinic-N (398.4 eV), pyrrolic-N (399.8 eV), graphitic-N (400.9 eV), oxygenated-N (402.6 eV), and adsorbed –NO moiety (405.5 eV) (Fig. 2f), and their relative contents are compared in Fig. 2i.40,41 With increasing carbonization temperature, the ratio of graphitic N is increased. Since the graphitic-N could contribute all p electrons to the π-conjugated carbon, the electrical conductivity of PCPs would be enhanced.42

The morphologies of PCPs were examined by SEM and TEM. The platelets remain uniformly coated on the fiber substrate (Fig. S5†). A relatively smooth platelet surface is observed for the PCPs carbonized at low temperatures, while a wrinkled surface appears at higher temperature and even for PCP-900, fragments of platelets are found, possibly from the disintegration of the platelets (Fig. 3a, c, e, and g). The size of holes is commensurate with the size of the Co particles, namely, the higher the carbonization temperature, the larger the hole size (Fig. 3b, d, f and h). However, too many perforations may lead to poor mechanical properties as in PCP-900, deteriorating the structural robustness under the flow-based system, while the edge of PCP-600 is likely an amorphous dense layer (Fig. S6†), more crystalline lattice fringes are revealed in the PCPs carbonized at higher temperatures. As expected, the electrical conductivities of PCPs present an increasing trend with the carbonization temperature (Fig. S7†). It appears that the metallic Co particles not only serve as a template for creating nano-sized perforations but also offer the catalytic effect for the formation of graphitic carbon layers.43

The potential benefits of ameliorating structural and functional features of PCPs are confirmed in the following electrochemical test. CV was performed in a solution of 0.1 M VO2+ and 3 M H2SO4. In a potential range where no faradaic reaction occurs (Fig. S8†), we can estimate the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) from the double layer capacitance.44 As summarized in Fig. 4a, the capacitance per geometric electrode area increases with the carbonization temperature, likely because more Co particles are dissolved to create pores. The results are generally consistent with the nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurement, which shows the improvements of specific area to 32.73 m2 g−1 and pore volume to 0.0372 cm3 g−1 with PCP coated on TGF (Fig. S9 and Table S2†). The hydrophilicity of PCP electrodes also contributes to the large ECSA, as shown by the rapid electrolyte penetration into the electrode (Fig. 4a inset), in sharp contrast to the poor wetting properties of pristine graphite felt (Fig. S10†). The underlying structural and functional features of PCP electrodes are summarized in Table S3.†

(a) Current density vs. scan rate in the non-faradaic region (inset: electrolyte accessibility test of PCP-800); (b) cyclic voltammograms of PCP and TGF electrodes in 3 mol L−1 H2SO4 electrolyte containing 0.1 M VOSO4; (c) −ipa/ipc values; (d) voltage peak gap (ΔE) against scan rates. 
At a high potential, the oxidation of VO2+ and the reduction of VO2+ show up both as broad peaks (Fig. 4b and S11†). The intensity ratios of the anodic peak and cathodic peak (ipa/ipc) for all the PCP electrodes are similarly closer to 1, implying their excellent reversibility, which are much higher than that of neat TGF (Fig. 4c). Although the kinetics could not be directly derived from the CVs of porous electrodes, we may infer the rates of electrochemical reactions from the peak separations (ΔE). As summarized in Fig. 4d, with increasing scan rate, the order of the magnitude follows the trend of PCP-600 < TGF ≈ PCP-700 < PCP-900 < PCP-800. The trend cannot be simply explained by the differences in specific areas, and it suggests different catalytic activities of these electrodes. Given the distinct surface characteristics shown in XPS, these results underline the critical roles of defects and surface functional groups in determining the reaction kinetics.
Theoretical calculations
To elucidate the factors underlying the different catalytic properties, we performed DFT calculations. Among different PCPs, the most outstanding case is the large peak separation with PCP-900, despite its largest ECSA and highest electrical conductivity. Two possible reasons, postulated from Fig. 2g and i, are its low populations of defects and nitrogen dopants. To confirm this postulation, we first calculated the electrostatic potential (ESP) maps on the van der Waals surface to identify reaction active sites.45,46 The vanadium atom in the highly positively charged VO2+ ions has a high electrostatic potential, so as to facilitate the first step of its catalytic conversion to VO2+, i.e. the favorable adsorption, at one active site with a very negative ESP (Fig. S12†). As shown in Fig. 5a, the ESP in the sp2-hybridized carbon atoms is uniformly distributed on the molecular van der Waals surface with a value of −0.87 eV, but the π electrons are too inert to be directly used for electrocatalysis.47 Once a single vacancy is created in the carbon matrix, electrons would be localized around the defects through the unsaturated dangling bonds,48,49 leading to a very negative ESP value of −2.27 eV (Fig. 5b). Among different nitrogen dopants, the pyridinic-N has the most negative ESP value of −1.83 eV owing to the existence of extra lone-pair electrons (Fig. 5c), while relatively positive ESP values are achieved on the graphitic-N (−0.18 eV) and pyrrolic-N (−0.30 eV): the graphitic-N contributes all p electrons to the adjacent π-conjugated system while the pyrrolic-N shares one extra p electron with hydrogen (Fig. 5d and e).50,51 The above results suggest that the most favorable sites for adsorption of VO2+ are the vacancy defects and pyridinic-N species, which are indeed lacking in PCP-900. The adsorption energies were calculated on different graphene models and demonstrated the optimized structure (Fig. 5f). It is found that the adsorption affinity follows the order of vacancy defects (−7.02 eV) > pyridinic-N (−6.29 eV) > pyrrolic-N (−3.75 eV) > pristine G (−2.72 eV) > graphitic-N (−1.72 eV). These values are in agreement with the ESP calculation, except for pyrrolic-N. Though not having a negative ESP value, the pyrrolic-N site tends to distort the atomic structure when interacting with the vanadium–oxygen moiety through the bond elongation from 0.990 to 1.017 Å (Fig. S13†), which in turn weakens the interaction with bonded hydrogen and allows the facile adsorption of the vanadium–oxygen moiety. Although the solvated structure and the steps following the adsorption were not taken into account, the DFT calculation offers a plausible explanation for our observations and highlights active sites for the oxidation of VO2+. As PCP-800 possesses abundant active sites and a large surface area, we expect it to deliver the best performance when serving as the electrode for VRFBs.

Flow battery test
The PCP-800 electrode indeed achieves the best performance in a VRFB. The battery was assembled and tested with a PCP electrode on the positive side and TGF on the negative side so that the performance can be related to the properties of PCPs. Fig. 6a and S14† show a set of characteristic charging and discharging curves at 200 mA cm−2 and 400 mA cm−2, respectively. With increasing current density, the coulombic efficiency (CE) increases likely as a result of inhibited crossover, while the voltage and energy efficiencies (EE) drop due to polarization (Fig. 6b and S15†). The electrolyte utilization ratio (Fig. 6c) also decreases with current density as the higher polarization pushes the charging voltage towards the voltage cutoff, set to avoid water splitting.52 All electrodes tested show similar, high CEs but significantly different polarizations caused by structural and functional properties. The PCP-600 electrode suffers from the largest overpotential, and thus the lowest EE and electrolyte utilization, even worse than the bare TGF counterpart. The performance generally improves with increasing carbonization temperature. The lowest charge/discharge overpotential is found with PCP-800 despite its slightly low ECSA compared to PCP-900, which is in line with the CV results. More specifically, the VRFB assembled with the PCP-800 electrode delivers discharge capacities of 21.5 and 14.3 A h L−1 at current densities of 200 and 400 mA cm−1, respectively.

(a) Charge/discharge curves of the TGF and PCP electrodes at 200 mA cm−2; (b) coulombic and energy efficiencies; (c) electrolyte utilization ratio (%); (d) average voltage loss; (e) high-frequency EIS spectra (inset: full EIS spectra); (f) comparison of resistances arising from charge transfer, mass transport and ohmic resistance. 
To confirm the origin of different polarization performances, we derive and then dissect the polarization resistance for all the electrodes, which supports the rapid charge transfer on PCP-800 as the key. The average voltage losses are estimated from the discharging curves, which are plotted against current density to construct the polarization curves. The slopes of the curves are the areal polarization resistances, which are 1.40, 2.24, 1.31, 1.10 and 1.27 Ω cm2 for TGF, PCP-600, PCP-700, PCP-800, and PCP-900, respectively (Fig. 6d). The resistances comprise contributions from electronic resistance, ionic resistance of the membrane, charge transfer, and mass transport.53 The first two contributors can be determined via EIS (Fig. 6e). At high frequencies, the real impedance comes mainly from the electronic and membrane resistances, the latter of which is the same for all the batteries. Therefore, the different values in the high-frequency regions of EIS, 0.39, 0.34, 0.31, 0.30, and 0.28 Ω cm2 for PCP-600, PCP-700, PCP-800, TGF, and PCP-900, respectively, correspond to their differences in electronic resistance of the electrodes, which are in line with the electrical conductivities. These resistances are summarized in Fig. 6f, signifying that the electronic resistance is not the main cause of the different polarizations. As we expected the mass transport is similar among these electrodes given their similar porosities and architectures, and thus we attribute the difference to the factors influencing charge transfer, including the surface chemistry and the specific surface area, corroborating the results from characterization and DFT calculations. Meanwhile, the electrode does not work well for the V2/3+ redox couple on the negative side due to its catalysis towards the side reaction of hydrogen evolution (Fig. S16†).
The rate performance of the PCP-800 electrode is shown in Fig. 7a, exhibiting an excellent rate capability. It outperforms the vast majority of advanced electrode materials for VRFBs in terms of energy efficiencies at different current densities (Fig. 7b and Table S4†). It also delivers a comparable stability with the CE > 98% in 700 cycles and at 550 cycles, and the cell lost 50% of the initial capacity, which is among the better performances in the literature (Fig. 7c).24 Finally, we dissect the possible cause of efficiency loss during the cycling test. Since EIS spectra measured before and after 700 cycles do not change much (Fig. S17a†), we speculate two causes, the loss of oxygen functional groups on the negative electrode immersed in a reductive environment for a long time and the crossover of the electrolyte across the Nafion film.14 To verify our assumption, we reassemble the flow batteries with the previous 700-cycled PCP-800 as the positive electrode, fresh thermally treated graphite felt (TGF) as the negative electrode, and fresh electrolyte. As shown in Fig. S17b,† the performance is well recovered whose charge and discharge curves coincide with the initial one, proving the high stability of the PCP positive electrode.

Conclusions
In summary, we applied a MOF as the precursor to fabricate perforated carbon platelet electrodes. By controlling the carbonization temperature, the micro-nanostructure and surface chemistry of the electrodes were tuned to identify key parameters responsible for the battery performance according to systematic experimental characterization and DFT calculations. The optimized electrode (PCP-800) delivered an outstanding energy efficiency of 82.0% and 69.7% at current densities of 200 and 400 mA cm−2, respectively, and a long-term stability. Its enhanced electrochemical performance originated from the ameliorated structural and functional characteristics as follows: (i) the hierarchical interconnected graphitic layers in carbon platelets offered the highway for electron transfer; (ii) large specific surface area and nano-sized perforations ensured exposure of active sites, and ameliorated the infiltration of electrolyte; (iii) localized electrons among nitrogen dopants and topological defects exhibited a negative electrostatic potential so as to adsorb positively charged VO2+ and facilitate the subsequent redox reaction. The work provides not only a scalable, tunable method of electrode fabrication, but also crucial insights into structure–property relationships underpinning the performance of RFBs.
