By rationally screening processing solvents, a PCE of 4.50% was firstly achieved with definitely low toxic, non-halogenated and safe solvent fabrication, which is almost identical to that processed with o-dichlorobenzene.
Introduction
In the past few decades, a great deal of effort has been devoted to developing new photovoltaic materials for making highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs), and the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have been promoted to over 10%.1 With the rapid progress of PCE, PSCs show more potential in making large area, light-weight and flexible solar cells through roll-to-roll printing technologies. However, up to now, most of the high performance PSCs based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) are fabricated using highly toxic and harmful halogenated solvents, such as chlorobenzene (CB) or o-dichlorobenzene (DCB). Clearly, since these kinds of solvents have been well recognized as the contaminants to the environment and human health,2 the PSCs fabricated by these types of solvents cannot be used in industrial applications. Therefore, to develop new photovoltaic materials that can be processed through low- or non-toxic solvents becomes a critical issue for the PSC field.
As is known, conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives are commonly used as the electron donor and acceptor materials in active layers of the PSCs with the BHJ structure, respectively. In order to form bi-continuous nanoscale phase separation in the active layers, which is crucial for facilitating the exciton diffusion, charge separation and transport in PSCs,3–9 the donor and acceptor materials must be well soluble in the processing solvents for device fabrication. Since chlorinated and/or aromatic solvents, like CB, DCB, toluene, chloroform etc., show strong solvation effects for conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives, these solvents are broadly employed in device fabrications of PSCs. Moreover, in order to finely tune morphological properties of the donor and acceptor blend films, solvent mixtures are usually adopted in device fabrication of PSCs. In this case, low boiling point (b.p.) solvents showing good solubilities to both the donor and acceptor materials, like toluene, CB or DCB, can be used as the host solvents, and high b.p. solvents showing asymmetric solvencies to the solutes with the host solvents, such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) or 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), can be employed as the solvent additives.10–12 Therefore, to develop PSCs processed by green solvents, not only the host solvents but also the solvent additives must be taken into consideration.
Recently, quite a few research groups showed interest in removing chlorinated and/or aromatic solvents from PSC fabrication processes. For example, Jen et al. used the solvent mixture of o-xylene and 1,2-dimethylnaphthalene (1,2-DMN) to fabricate the PSCs based on PBDT-DTNT and PC71BM, and the device shows similar PCEs as the device processed by DCB and DIO.13 Li et al. employed toluene and NMP to fabricate the P3HT:ICBA-based device and realized a PCE similar to that of the counterpart prepared from DCB.14 Hou et al. used the triethylene glycol monoether (TEG) functional group to modify the conjugated polymer based on benzodithiophene (BDT) and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) and the resulting polymer (PBDTTT-TEG) showed excellent solubility in some types of non-halogenated and non-aromatic solvents; as a result, a PCE of 1.55% was obtained using NMP as the processing solvent for device fabrication, and after adding a 5% volume ratio of DIO as the additive, a PCE of 5.23% can be realized.15 Although the non-halogenated solvents can be used as the host, there are still some drawbacks in these reported studies: firstly, harmful solvents like DIO and CN must be used as the additives to control the morphology of the active layer, because PCBM is apt to form large size aggregations in the blend films due to its limited solubility in the non-chlorinated host solvents;16–18 secondly, at ambient temperature, the saturated vapor pressures of the solvent additives and some types of non-chlorinated solvents like N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and its derivatives are very low so that the drying process of the blend films would take a quite long time, which is acceptable for the spin-coating process for making small area devices but extremely inconvenient to practical roll-to-roll printing. Therefore, in order to remove harmful solvents from the device fabrication process, both the donor and acceptor materials, i.e. conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives, must be re-designed, and also environmentally friendly solvents with appropriate properties should be applied.
Although many benzene derivatives, especially for commonly used solvents like toluene, xylene, CB and DCB, are detrimental to the environment and human health, this type of solvent possesses strong solvencies to conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives, which is of great importance to the solution coating process in PSC fabrication. Therefore, in order to minimize the difficulty of molecular design of the active layer materials, we tried to look over the properties of the benzene derivative solvents. At this moment, anisole attracted our attention. As is known, anisole shows a b.p. of 153.8 °C and moderate saturated vapor pressures, which are between those of CB and DCB. The toxicity of anisole is much lower compared with the commonly used halogenated aromatic solvents, and it can even be used as the fragrance for cosmetics and as the additive for foods. Moreover, anisole is biodegradable so that it will not cause accumulative damage to the environment. Thus, anisole may be a potential green solvent for the fabrication of PSCs.
In this work, by incorporating the superior photovoltaic properties of alkylthio-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-TS)19 units and the excellent solubility in non-chlorinated solvents of the TEG-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TEG-TT) units,15 a new polymer donor material named PBDTTT-S-TEG was designed and synthesized (see Scheme 1). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PBDTTT-S-TEG was 87.3 kDa, which was estimated by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) with tetrahydrofuran as the eluent. The thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) plot shows that the polymer has a good thermal stability with an onset of decomposition temperature at ca. 320 °C (see the ESI, Fig. S1†). According to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, neither endo- nor exothermic processes can be found in the 0–300 °C range at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. S2†).

Results and discussion
UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDTTT-S-TEG in the solution state and as solid films are shown in Fig. 1a. The comparison between the absorption spectra of the solutions and the films reveals that, from solution to solid film, the two absorption peaks are slightly red-shifted, which is often observed in conjugated polymers and can be ascribed to the enhanced intermolecular interaction in the solid state. On the other hand, since the absorption spectrum of the anisole solution is almost identical to that of the DCB solution, anisole may have a similar solvency to the polymer as DCB. The absorption spectrum of the film shows an absorption edge (λedge) at 783 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.58 eV, which is similar to those of the polymers based on BDT and TT.20–23 The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was employed to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the polymer. As shown in Fig. 1b, the onset oxidation and reduction potentials (φox and φred) are 0.92 V and −1.05 V (vs. Ag/Ag+), corresponding to a HOMO of −5.24 eV and a LUMO of −3.27 eV, respectively.

Since the polymer with TEG groups shows good solubility in anisole, the TEG group and the likes were used to replace the methyl group on PC61BM and thus to improve solubility of the acceptor in anisole. Herein, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether (DEG), TEG, dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether (DPG) and tripropylene glycol monomethyl ether (TPG) were used to obtain four novel PC61BM derivatives as shown in Scheme 1. The synthesis methods of the fullerene derivatives are provided (see the ESI†) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) proved their good thermal stabilities (Fig. S3†). In comparison with PC61BM, the newly synthesized fullerenes exhibit much higher solubilities (>40 mg ml−1) in anisole, and it can be easily dissolved in other types of solvents like chloroform, tetrahydrofuran (THF), NMP, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) etc. The optical and electrochemical properties of the four fullerene derivatives were characterized, and PC61BM was also tested in parallel to make clear comparisons. As shown in Fig. S4,† either in the solution state or in solid films, the absorption spectra of these four fullerene derivatives are identical to that of PC61BM. In CV measurements (Fig. S5†), the φred values of these four fullerene derivatives are all at ca. −0.57 V, which is similar to that of PC61BM and corresponds to a LUMO of −3.75 eV. These results indicate the substitutions of the TEG group and the like have little influence on the absorption spectrum and the LUMO level of PC61BM.
We fabricated PSCs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-S-TEG:Fullerene derivative/Ca/Al. Initially, DCB, the commonly used solvent, was used as the processing solvent to make the devices for screening the D/A ratio in the active layers. It was found that the optimal D/A ratios of the devices based on different fullerenes are all at 1:1 (w/w). Fig. 2a and b show the current density–voltage (I–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the PSCs at the D/A ratio of 1:1 fabricated with DCB (under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), and the photovoltaic data of the PSCs including the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCEs are summarized in Table 1. The device based on PBDTTT-S-TEG:PC61B-DEG shows Voc = 0.750 V, Jsc = 12.42 mA cm−2, FF = 47.78% and PCE = 4.45%, and these parameters are very similar to the values obtained from the device based on PBDTTT-S-TEG:PC61BM, i.e. Voc = 0.748 V, Jsc = 12.45 mA cm−2, FF = 49.73 and PCE = 4.63%. The PCEs of the devices with PC61B-TEG, PC61B-DPG and PC61B-TPG are 3.77%, 2.06% and 3.17%, respectively.

The EQE of the devices based on the fullerene derivatives is provided in Fig. 2b. As shown, the three devices based on PC61B-DEG, PC61B-TEG and PC61B-TPG show similar EQE spectra, which are also similar to those of the device based on PC61BM. However, the device based on PBDTTT-S-TEG:PC61B-DPG exhibits much lower EQE values than the other four types of devices, and as a result, this device shows the lowest Jsc value. Moreover, the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the five types of blend films were evaluated using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. S6† and Table 1, the μh and μe of the PBDTTT-S-TEG:PC61B-DEG blend film are 1.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (a little better in the film processed with anisole, see Table S1†), respectively, which are similar to those of the blend film containing PBDTTT-S-TEG:PC61BM. On the other hand, the μh and μe of the PBDTTT-S-TEG:PC61B-DEG blend film are symmetric and higher than those of the blend films with the other three PC61BM derivatives. Overall, according to the initial photovoltaic testing and mobility results, for the PSCs using PBDTTT-S-TEG as a donor material, PC61B-DEG should be the best acceptor material among these fullerene derivatives.
As shown in Fig. 1a, the polymer shows weak absorption in the short wavelength range, i.e. from 400 nm to 600 nm, and as is known, fullerene derivatives based on C[60] often have weak absorption in this range. As a result, the EQE curves in Fig. 2b exhibit low values in the range of 400–600 nm. Considering that the application of PC71BM has been proved to be an efficient method to utilize sunlight in the short wavelength range,24 we tried to use PC71BM as the starting material and synthesize a new acceptor named PC71B-DEG (Scheme 1). Similarly, the electrochemical properties and thermal stability of PC71B-DEG were characterized (Fig. S7–9†), and the results show that it has similar properties to those of PC61B-DEG, and as expected, PC71B-DEG shows much stronger absorption in the visible range than PC61B-DEG as shown in Fig. 1c. Then, PC71B-DEG was used as the acceptor in PSCs for further testing. As shown in Fig. 2e and listed in Table 3, when DCB was used as the processing solvent, the device shows Voc = 0.746 V, Jsc = 12.91 mA cm−2, FF = 47.26% and PCE = 4.55%. In comparison with the data obtained for the device based on PC61B-DEG, the PC71B-DEG device shows similar Voc and FF values but an improved EQE in the range of 400–600 nm (Fig. 2f) and thus higher Jsc. The results clearly demonstrate that the application of PC71B-DEG in the device is helpful to utilize sunlight in the short wavelength range.
Since the donor PBDTTT-S-TEG and the acceptor DEG substituted fullerene derivatives can be easily dissolved in many types of non-aromatic or/and non-halogenated high polar solvents, we got the chance to use different solvents to make PSCs. Herein, besides anisole, the other four types of solvents were selected in device fabrication. For example, as concluded in Table 2, dimethylacetamide (DMAC) was selected because it has similar properties but is more stable than DMF; 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF) and cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) were used because they are broadly used as green solvents with low toxicity; NMP was used because it is a biodegradable solvent with low toxicity and flammability.

To investigate the reasons for the differences in solvent processing, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to study the topography and the bulk morphology of the active layers. As shown in Fig. 3, it is clear that, either on the surface or in the bulk, the micromorphology of the film casted from anisole is almost the same as that casted from DCB, which shows the surface root-mean-square (RMS) Rq of 0.784 compared to the Rq of 0.762 under DCB processing. Thus, these results lead to the similar PCE. As DMAC and CPME were used as processing solvents, the Rq increased a little to 3.18 and 1.20, respectively, and the phase separation became blurred. In MeTHF processing, large size aggregations can be found and a high Rq of 19.4 was observed, which should be ascribed to the low b.p. of MeTHF and the relatively poor solubility of PCB-DEG in this solvent. In NMP processing, although the phase separation seems to be acceptable in the bulk morphology, the polymer separated out from the solution and formed into a network on the surface, which should be due to the limited solubility of the polymer and the long drying process of NMP. These results prove that the anisole is indeed an alternative to DCB as an environmentally friendly processing solvent for PSC fabrication.

In order to further enhance the device performance, we applied PC71B-DEG as the acceptor in device fabrication with anisole processing. As expected, it gives Voc = 0.746 V, Jsc = 12.41 mA cm−2, FF = 48.57% and PCE = 4.50%, and device performance and film morphology are very similar to the results with DCB processing (Table 3 and Fig. S10†). Several solvent additives, like DIO, NMP and 1,8-octanedithiol (OT), were employed to the anisole processed PSCs, but no obvious improvement in PCE could be observed (Fig. S11 and Table S3†).
Conclusions
In conclusion, a novel alkylthio-substituted conjugated polymer, PBDTTT-S-TEG, was synthesized and characterized, which possesses comparatively higher Voc than the commonly used PBDTTT-based polymers and can be dissolved well in many types of solvents. In order to further improve the processability of PSCs in green solvents, four new types of green solvent processable fullerene derivatives substituted with oligo ether diols, PC61B-DEG, PC61B-TEG, PC61B-DPG and PC61B-TPG, were designed, synthesized and applied as acceptors in PSCs, respectively. The device based on PBDTTT-S-TEG:PC61B-DEG gave the best performance and the highest charge carrier mobility. Then, several green solvents were screened as the processing solvents for device fabrication, and anisole was found to be the ideal alternative for green solvent processing rather than DCB. Due to the stronger absorption of C[70] in the range of 400–600 nm compared with C[60], the DEG substituted C[70] derivative, named PC71B-DEG, was synthesized and applied in device fabrication as well, which can lead to a higher Jsc and thus an increased PCE. As expected, PCE = 4.50% (Voc = 0.746 V, Jsc = 12.41 mA cm−2, FF = 48.57%) was achieved using anisole as the processing solvent, and this result is almost identical to the device processed with DCB. Overall, with the rapid development of PSCs, the industrial manufacturability of PSCs has become one of the key issues for real applications, which requires that all the procedures of manufacturing must be benign and safe for the environment and human health. Herein, we firstly demonstrated the green solvent processable PSCs starting from the perspective of molecular design and realized almost the same PCE by using anisole, a much more green solvent compared to CB, DCB and so on. Therefore, this work will be of great significance in paving the way for the industrialization of PSCs.

Device fabrication
Polymer solar cell devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT-PSS/PBDTTT-S-TEG:fullerene derivatives/Ca/Al were fabricated under the following conditions: patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass with a sheet resistance of 10–15 ohm per square was cleaned with a surfactant scrub and then underwent a wet-cleaning process inside an ultrasonic bath, beginning with deionized water followed by acetone and isopropanol. After oxygen plasma cleaning for 10 min, a 40 nm thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Bayer Baytron 4083) anode buffer layer was spin-cast onto the ITO substrate and then dried by baking in an oven at 150 °C for 15 min. The active layer, with a thickness in the range of 80–100 nm, was then deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer by spin-coating from a 15 mg ml−1 blend solution of PBDTTT-TEG and fullerene derivatives, followed by the common methanol treatment. Finally, 20 nm Ca and 100 nm Al layers were successively deposited under vacuum onto the active layer at a pressure of ca. 3 × 10−4 Pa. The overlapping area between the cathode and the anode defined a pixel size of 4 mm2. Except for the deposition of the PEDOT:PSS layers, all the fabrication processes were carried out inside a controlled atmosphere of a nitrogen dry box containing less than 5 ppm oxygen and moisture. The mobility was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method by a hole-only device with the structure of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/Active layer/Au or an electron-only device with the structure of ITO/TIPD/Active layer/Al and estimated using the Mott–Gurney equation.
