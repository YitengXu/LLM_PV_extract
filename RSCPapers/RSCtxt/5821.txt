    , Accepted 18th August 2016First published on 6th September 2016AbstractFor quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs), optimizing interfacial structures by specifically developing new interfacial modification methods to minimize recombination associated with photo-generated carrier transportation and collection is an effective way to achieve highly efficient devices. In this respect, fumed SiO2 nanoparticles have been used as a polysulfide electrolyte additive for improving the interface in a TiO2/QDs/electrolyte for the first time. It was found that the fill factor (FF), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the cell performance of the devices are significantly enhanced. Additionally, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.23% is achieved, which is one of the highest efficiencies for liquid-junction QDSCs. Furthermore, the electron transport and recombination processes in the CdSexTe1−x QDSCs with the SiO2 modified electrolyte have been investigated. This revealed that the existence of SiO2 nanoparticles in the electrolyte can create an energy barrier for the recombination between photo-generated electrons from the QDs as well as the recombination between the electrolyte and the injected electrons from TiO2. It is encouraging that CdSexTe1−x QDSCs in SiO2 modified electrolytes can reach a higher electron collection efficiency (98%) and longer electron lifetime. This work provides a simple and convenient method to modify the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interfaces of QDSCs.
Introduction
Nanomaterials and nanostructural architectures have facilitated the evolution of a new generation of solar cells. Inorganic semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are attractive light harvesters in solar cells due to their excellent optoelectronic properties such as high extinction coefficients, tunable band-gaps and large intrinsic dipole moments.1 In particular, the prospect for breaking the Shockley–Queisser thermodynamic limit by utilizing multiple exciton generation (MEG) has triggered interest to explore QD-based solar cells.2 Various strategies have been employed to integrate QDs into solar cells, including QD-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs), QD–polymer hybrid solar cells and QD Schottky solar cells.3–5 To date, QDSCs exhibit the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.6% in comparison to the other two kinds of QD solar cells. However, QDSCs still lag behind other popular new generation devices, such as perovskite solar cells (PSCs, 22.1%) and dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs, 14.3%).6–8
In fact, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of QDSCs is highly competitive, and in some cases better than these two types of device.6,9,10 This is mostly due to the successful deposition of high quality QDs on TiO2 photoanodes. Aside from the in situ deposition method, QDs are also able to anchor well onto the TiO2 electrode with the aid of bi-functional linker molecules (i.e. mercaptopropionic acid).3,11 Typically, different colloidal QDs (such as CdSe, PbS, CdSexTe1−x, CuInS2, CuInSe2, Zn–Cu–In–Se and so on) can be obtained via high-temperature “one-pot” synthesis or hot-injection methods in organic systems, in which size distribution, surface-stabilized ligands, band gap alignment and optoelectronic properties are well controlled.6,9,12–17 Furthermore, this pre-synthesized colloidal QDs/TiO2 assembly has shown great potential in achieving better cell performance, and relatively higher Jsc and 11.61% PCE have been obtained for Zn–Cu–In–Se QDSCs.6
Despite its high Jsc, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of QDSCs are still too low, leading to unfavorable PCEs. This is generally ascribed to the intrinsic properties of the materials and the level of charge recombination in the device.18,19 The Voc and FF are primarily related to the selection of the hole transportation material (such as the widely used Sn2−/S2−) and the counter electrode material (usually in situ Cu2S on brass), since the theoretical Voc is determined by the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the electrons in the TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte, while the FF is predominantly influenced by the kinetic performance and conductivity of the counter electrode.20 In the meantime, interfacial contact and kinetics are also important factors governing the Voc, FF and device performance as well.18,20 When a polysulfide (Sn2−/S2−) electrolyte and in situ Cu2S on a brass counter electrode are used, the Voc and FF mainly suffer from interfacial recombination processes: photo-injected electrons may recombine with the holes in QDs or the oxidized species in the electrolyte, and the latter is particularly crucial to the device performance. Accordingly, several effective ways have been developed: (1) surface modification of the TiO2 electrode by using wide-bandgap metal oxides (i.e. Al2O3,21 SiO2,22,23 MgO24etc.), which act as energy barriers to lower the physical contact between the photo-injected electrons in the TiO2 and oxidized species in the electrolyte, thereby retarding their recombination; (2) introducing a ZnS or ZnSe passivation layer onto the QD surfaces using successive ion-layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) to reduce the QDs/electrolyte interfacial recombination;17,18,20 (3) designing type-I or type-II QD core–shell structures to eliminate surface defects in the QDs and decrease the charge recombination (examples include CuInS2/CdS,25 ZnTe/CdSe,26 CdTe/CdSe27 and CdS/CdSe28 QDs). In particular, engineering a type-II structure can achieve effective spatial separation of photo-generated electrons and holes, and provide an impactful way to control the interfacial charge transfer properties. Meng et al.25 synthesized type-II core–shell CuInS2–Mn/CdS QDs, in order to create energy level alignment for QDSCs, facilitating the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes, and thus leading to faster electron extraction and collection. Zhong et al. reported type-II ZnTe/CdSe QDs with an extended absorption range into the infrared region, which improves the electron injection rate and retards charge recombination, leading to a PCE of 7.17%.26
In addition to the above routine interfacial modification methods, adding appropriate additives into the electrolyte is also an effective strategy. For example, in DSCs, using 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and guanidiniumthiocyanate (GuSCN) as additives in the I−/I3− electrolyte can significantly increase the Voc, which is supposed to upshift the conduction band of the TiO2 to suppress the photo-injected electron recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, leading to better cell performance.29 To QDSCs, however, using this kind of additive in the electrolyte is rather limited. Currently, only polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been reported as an effective additive to improve the Voc, FF and the PCE (5.80% vs. 6.74%) of CdSe QDSCs,30 which is different from conventional gel electrolytes.31 More importantly, this method is cheap, easy and effective. Therefore, it is imperative to seek effective additives for the electrolyte to regulate the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interfaces for highly efficient QDSCs, and to fully understand the interfacial electron transfer dynamics.
In this respect, photochemically and electro-chemically stable silica nanoparticles (NPs) were introduced as an additive for the first time into a polysulfide electrolyte to modify the QD/TiO2 surface for high-efficiency CdSexTe1−x QDSCs. A PCE of 11.23% has been achieved under AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2, and the cell stability has been significantly improved as well. Unlike conventional gelating liquid electrolytes, the existence of SiO2 mainly restrains interfacial recombination and thereby improves the performance of QDSCs. A detailed study on the ability of the SiO2 on the CdSexTe1−x QD/TiO2 surface to modulate interfacial carrier transfer dynamics has been elucidated. Our work provides a new and convenient method to regulate TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interfacial carrier transfer and offers a better understanding of the charge recombination dynamics of QDSCs.
Results and discussion
Characterization of CdSexTe1−x QDs and CdSexTe1−x/TiO2 films
CdSexTe1−x alloyed QDs are one of the most promising potential sensitizers for QDSCs due to their relatively narrow bandgap, good chemical stability and photoelectric properties. In our experiments, CdSexTe1−x QDs were synthesized using a high temperature one-pot non-injection method, described in our previous work.14,32 The absorption spectrum of the QD solution covers the whole visible light region and some of the near-infrared (NIR) region, however, no specific exciton peak was found. A strong PL emission peak, located at 790 nm can be seen in Fig. 1a. Furthermore, mono-dispersed CdSexTe1−x QDs can be clearly observed in the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image, confirming that the average particle size is ∼5 nm. Regardless of whether or not they are coated on the TiO2 film, clear lattice fringes of CdSexTe1−x QDs can be distinguished, indicating high crystal quality. Moreover, the lattice spacing (0.357 nm) is squarely between the (111) plane of zinc blend CdSe (lattice spacing: 0.351 nm, JPCDS card no. 19-0191) and the (111) plane of zinc blend CdTe (lattice spacing: 0.374 nm, JPCDS card no. 65-1081), in good accordance with previous results (see Fig. 1b and c).32

Formation of a fumed SiO2 nanoparticle-modified polysulfide electrolyte
Fumed silica (SiO2) possesses an amorphous, nonporous structure, and is also an electrochemically inert material. The type of fumed silica employed in this work is composed of branched aggregates formed by the fusion of primary SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), and tailoring its surface functionalities is possible.33 In previous work, much effort has been focused on SiO2-composite electrolytes for DSCs and lithium ion batteries, which were created by adding fumed silica to low or moderate molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), lithium salts, or ionic liquids etc.34 Inspiringly, these SiO2-composite electrolytes display high conductivity, mechanical stability of solids and easy process ability of liquids. Accordingly, SiO2 NPs generally act as a “gelling agent” to effectively mobilize the liquid medium to form (quasi-) solid-state materials. In our study, a commercially available fumed silica (Degussa, A150) with a size range from 10 to 20 nm was used as an additive in a polysulfide electrolyte, which tends to link together by a combination of fusion and hydrogen bonding to form chainlike aggregates with a high surface area.35 According to the literature, both “isolated” and “hydrogen-bonded” silanols (Si–OH) exist on the fumed silicon surface. Therefore, when the silica is dispersed in the polysulfide electrolyte, isolated silanols may form hydrogen bonds between isolated silanols and water molecules to give a three-dimensional (3D) network gel structure.36 Besides, the viscosity of the electrolyte obviously increases after the fumed SiO2 is introduced, as shown in Fig. 2.

Photovoltaic performance
As-prepared CdSexTe1−x QDs decorated TiO2 films were sequentially treated with TiCl4 solution37 and a standard ZnS SILAR (successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction) method15 in order to reduce the recombination between the TiO2 photoanode and the polysulfide electrolyte. Then, CdSexTe1−x QD decorated TiO2 photoanodes, polysulfide electrolytes (with and without SiO2, denoted as E2 and E1, respectively) and a Cu2S counter electrode were assembled into sandwich-type CdSexTe1−x QDSCs (SEM image in Fig. S1†). Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) with respect to different amounts of SiO2 additives are given in Fig. 3, and the performance parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE) are listed in Table 1. For comparison, a solar cell based on the conventional polysulfide electrolyte without SiO2 additive (denoted as E1) was also fabricated, with a PCE of 8.73%, a Jsc of 21.18 mA cm−2, a Voc of 643 mV and a FF of 0.641. We can see that when fumed SiO2 is introduced into the polysulfide electrolyte, the cell performance improves remarkably. Besides, the devices exhibit better PCEs as the amount of SiO2 added increases. Typically, the Voc and FF significantly increase while a slight improvement of Jsc can be seen. A PCE as high as 11.23% can be obtained with a Jsc of 22.21 mA cm−2, Voc of 710 mV and FF of 0.712 when 3.0 wt% of SiO2 is present in the electrolyte (denoted as E2). However, further increasing the amount of SiO2 brings about an unsatisfactory drop in the FF from 0.712 to 0.662 to 0.604, while the PCE drops to 8.97%, indicating that too much SiO2 additive is unfavorable to the cell performance.

For comparison, under the same experimental conditions, a device with an optimized PEG (6.0 wt%) composite electrolyte (denoted as E3) was also fabricated, which can present a PCE of 9.86%, with a Jsc of 21.83 mA cm−2, a Voc of 668 mV and a FF of 0.676. This PCE is lower than that of the device with the corresponding SiO2 composite electrolyte (Fig. 3). Further comparison between the conductivities of the three electrolytes (E1–E3) reveals that the introduction of SiO2 or PEG into the polysulfide electrolyte slightly decreases the conductivity (Table 1), and the conductivity of the SiO2-based electrolyte is somewhat higher than that of the PEG-based electrolyte. The Jsc of CdSexTe1−x QDSCs is also slightly improved by introducing the SiO2 or PEG additives, which is consistent with IPCE measurements in Fig. 3c.
Although QDSCs with a Cu2S counter electrode based on brass foil can exhibit better performance, the brass foil substrate suffers from continuous corrosion by the polysulfide electrolyte and it is hard to keep the electrolyte from leaking, leading to unsatisfactory stability. Here, in order to investigate the long-term stability of our solar cells with and without SiO2 additives, a CuS counter electrode was adopted for encapsulating the cells.38 Sealed QDSCs containing E1 and E2 were kept in the dark at ambient conditions, and were tested every two days for 42 days. From Fig. 3d, we can see that in the first few days, some increases in the PCEs (derived from the increase of Jsc and Voc) are observed, which is mainly attributed to the capillary effect of the electrolyte permeation into the mesoporous TiO2 film and CuS electrode, and is in good agreement with previous reports in QDSCs.38 Meanwhile, the cells containing the SiO2 NP-modified electrolyte (E2) show better stability than the reference solar cells (E1), that is, only a 6.3% drop in the PCE for the E2-based cell is found after 42 days of storage, whereas the PCE of the E1-based cell (conventional polysulfide electrolyte) drops by 23.3%. It is thus deduced that the improved stability is attributed to the SiO2 NPs adsorbed on the TiO2/QDs surface, which can effectively prevent the leakage of the polysulfide electrolyte (Fig. S2†).
Investigation on interfacial charge transfer, accumulation and recombination processes
As we know, for conventional gel electrolytes in QDSCs, the corresponding cell performances are only comparable to the those with liquid electrolytes.30,39 It is worth noting that the SiO2 composite electrolyte exhibits much better cell performance (11.23% vs. 8.73%). Although some increases in the viscosity can be seen as the amount of SiO2 increases, this suggests that the existence of SiO2 not only gels the liquid polysulfide electrolyte, but also inhibits interfacial recombination to improve the cell performance. Here, a more reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is presented.
The influence of the SiO2 additive on the interfacial charge transport, accumulation, recombination processes as well as the cell performance, was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the dark, with a forward bias from 300 to 600 mV in the frequency range from 105 to 0.1 Hz.14,32Fig. 4a gives the representative Nyquist plots of the QDSCs containing the E1–E3 electrolytes at a forward bias of 600 mV in the dark, which were fitted using Zview software by using the equivalent circuit model (inset of Fig. 4c). The fitted data are presented in Table 2. We can see that two semicircles are found in the Nyquist plots: the first small semicircle describes the impedance associated with the charge transfer process (Rct-CE) at the Cu2S electrode/electrolyte interface in the high frequency range, while the second large semicircle represents the recombination resistance (Rct-TiO2) at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface and the chemical capacitance of the TiO2 film (Cμ) in the mid/low frequency ranges. Additionally, the ohmic series resistance (Rs), consisting of the transport resistance of the transparent conducting oxide and the relevant connection, is determined in the high frequency region where the phase is zero. In comparison to the reference cell (E1), the Rs of the devices containing E2 or E3 increase from 9.80 to more than 13 Ω when the SiO2 or PEG additives are introduced into the electrolyte (Table 2), in agreement with the conductivity results in Table 1.

As we know, Cμ mainly represents the electron density under a small variation potential drop at the TiO2 photoanode. Fig. 4b depicts the relationship between Cμ and different applied bias voltages of the three cells (E1–E3). There is no obvious change in Cμ among these three cells and their exponential variation tendencies with applied bias voltages are quite close, suggesting that the introduction of SiO2 or PEG additives in the electrolyte does not change the surface states of TiO2 under the same forward bias. However, the Rct-TiO2 of the solar cells increases after SiO2 or PEG are added to the electrolyte under the same forward bias, indicating that the existence of SiO2 or PEG additives can effectively decrease the interfacial charge recombination, which is in good consistency with the photovoltaic performance, as shown in Fig. 4c and Table 1. In fact, in our experiments, the Voc of the CdSexTe1−x QDSCs remarkably increases after SiO2 is introduced into the electrolyte. For these three electrolyte systems, the conduction band (CB) position of the TiO2 photoanode is supposed to be identical. Accordingly, the increase in the Voc may be caused by other factors, such as the change in the potential of redox couples (Sn2−/S2−) in the electrolyte or the flux of injected electrons. The Rct-TiO2 of the E2-based device is found to be relatively larger than the E3-based device. Furthermore, based on the EIS results mentioned above, the electron lifetime (τeisn) is estimated from τeisn = Rct-TiO2 × Cμ, as given in Table 2.18 We can see that the cell with the SiO2 composite electrolyte has an electron lifetime of 180.3 ms, which is longer than those of the CdSexTe1−x QDSCs with the conventional electrolyte (101.3 ms) and the PEG-based electrolyte (118.2 ms). It is thus suggested that introducing SiO2 NPs as additives in the polysulfide electrolyte has more advantages over PEG in suppressing charge recombination.
To further testify the EIS results, the open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) was also tested (Fig. S3†) and the electron lifetime (τocvdn) was estimated by the following equation:40,41 (1)
As shown in Fig. 4d, at the same Voc values, the electron lifetimes decrease in the sequence of τocvdn(E2) > τocvdn(E3) > τocvdn(E1), suggesting that the existence of SiO2 NPs in the electrolyte indeed can remarkably suppress the recombination processes of electron injection from the QDs into the electrolyte and the injected electron from TiO2 into the electrolyte, in good agreement with the EIS results.
Time-resolution photoluminescence (PL) spectra
As we know, for CdSexTe1−x QDSCs, photo-generated carrier separation is followed by injection processes into the TiO2 photoanode and unfavorable non-radiative losses (see eqn (2)–(4)):42 CdSexTe1−x + hν → CdSexTe1−x (e + h)(2) CdSexTe1−x (e + h) + TiO2 → CdSexTe1−x (h) + TiO2 (e)(3) CdSexTe1−x (h) + e → CdSexTe1−x(4) CdSexTe1−x (h) + S2− → CdSexTe1−x + S22−(5)
In order to understand the influence of different electrolyte compositions on the carrier dynamics at the CdSexTe1−x QDs/electrolyte interface, time-resolution photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was also carried out, recorded at 780 nm after excitation at 445 nm. Here, bi-exponential decay kinetics is satisfactory in determining the average emission lifetime by using the following expression:42,43 τ = (a1τ12 + a2τ22)/(a1τ1 + a2τ2)(6)
The analysis of the PL measurements is summarized in Table 3. When no electrolyte solution is involved, significant emission quenching of CdSexTe1−x QDs on the TiO2 film is observed over that on an Al2O3 film, corresponding to the electron injection from excited CdSexTe1−x into TiO2 (Fig. 5). Average emission lifetimes (τ) are estimated to be 6.97 and 25.41 ns for CdSexTe1−x QDs on the TiO2 and Al2O3 films, respectively. Accordingly, the apparent electron transfer rate (Ket) is estimated to be 1.04 × 108 s−1 in terms of the following equation:44 Ket = 1/τ(QDs + TiO2) − 1/τ(QDs + Al2O3)(7)

 Fig. 5  PL emission decay plots of CdSexTe1−x/electrolyte on Al2O3 (a) and (c) and TiO2 substrates (b) and (d) for different solution systems. 
Here, several electrolyte systems are considered in order to further understand the charge injection and decay processes at the CdSexTe1−x QDs/electrolyte interface.40 It can be seen that for Al2O3/CdSexTe1−x QDs, a quite similar emission quenching tendency is observed regardless of whether it is exposed in 1 M NaOH solution or not, representing a natural decay via electron–hole recombination, as shown in Fig. 5a. However, the average lifetime of TiO2/CdSexTe1−x QDs in 1 M NaOH solution slightly decreases to 22.66 ns with an apparent electron transfer rate (Ket) of 8.66 × 106 s−1. It is thus suggested that the existence of hydroxyl ions (OH−) instead of any hole scavengers is prejudicial to photo-generated electron injection from CdSexTe1−x QDs into TiO2, leading to slower radiative decay on the TiO2 substrate. Furthermore, if other influencing factors are neglected, the conduction band position of TiO2 may become negative-shifted in the presence of the NaOH solution, causing a smaller driving force for the electron injection.45
For QDSCs, S2− reduced species in the polysulfide (Sn2−/S2−) electrolyte can effectively scavenge the holes in CdSexTe1−x QDs (eqn (5)). Here, the CdSexTe1−x/Al2O3 system is selected for monitoring the emission quenching arising from hole transfer at the CdSexTe1−x QDs/Na2S interface. As we can see, the average lifetime of the Al2O3/CdSexTe1−x QDs film in 1 M Na2S solution decreases to 13.72 ns. Supposing that the decreased lifetime in the Na2S solution is entirely due to the scavenging of holes (1 M S2− ion), the apparent hole transfer rate is estimated to be 3.74 × 107 s−1 in comparison with Al2O3/CdSexTe1−x QDs in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution (28.19 ns). Further introduction of SiO2 NPs into 1 M Na2S solution slightly reduces the decay rate, leading to an average lifetime of 16.50 ns. Obviously, some QD surfaces are occupied by SiO2 NPs, which reduces the interfacial interaction between photo-generated holes and S2− ions (electron donor), leading to a relatively lower apparent hole transfer rate (2.52 × 107 s−1). As we know, there is a dynamic competition between the hole scavenging (hole transfer to S2−) process and the electron–hole recombination process. In particular, the QD surface is also easily oxidized by photo-generated holes.46,47 Therefore, if the scavenging of holes by the redox couple is kinetically slow, the hole oxidation process is likely to prevail over the reduction of photo-generated holes, leading to the instability of the QDs. In fact, no self-degradation is found in the CdSexTe1−x QDs/Al2O3/Na2S–SiO2 electrolyte system during the measurements. Here, a better kinetic consistency is revealed between the electron injection rate (1.80 × 107 s−1) and the hole scavenging rate (2.52 × 107 s−1), which is beneficial for inhibiting charge recombination and improving the cell performance as well.
As a matter of fact, the emission quenching of CdSexTe1−x QDs in Na2S solution on a TiO2 substrate, or CdSexTe1−x QDs in a polysulfide electrolyte (Sn2−/S2−) solution, is more complicated regardless of whether they are on TiO2 or Al2O3 substrates, since both electron and hole transfer is involved. Although it is difficult to definitely distinguish these two processes by using only emission quenching measurements, the variation tendencies with and without SiO2 modified polysulfide electrolytes are the same. The average lifetimes are given in Table 3. Typically, the influence of SiO2 additives on the emission quenching is the same as those in the CdSexTe1−x QDs/Al2O3/Na2S–SiO2 systems.
Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS)
Furthermore, intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) were also employed to investigate the electron transport and recombination processes in the QDSCs. In detail, electron transport dynamics can be evaluated by IMPS under a short-circuit condition, while the electron lifetime related to the recombination process is determined from the IMVS under an open-circuit condition. Accordingly, the electron transit time (τd) and electron lifetime (τIMVSn) can primarily be determined as follows:48,49 τd = 1/2πfIMPS(8) τIMVSn = 1/2πfIMVS(9)where fIMPS (or fIMVS) is the frequency of the minimum IMPS (or IMVS) imaginary component. Based on electron transit time (τd), the electron diffusion coefficient Dn can also be obtained from the expression: Dn = d2/Cτd, in which d is the thickness of the TiO2 photoanode, C is a constant with a value of about 2.35 and τd is the electron transit time. It can be seen from Fig. 6a and S4† that for each device, both τd and τIMVSn decrease with an increase in light intensity. It is reasonable to assume that as the light intensity increases, the injected photo-generated electron concentration is increased accordingly, which accelerates electron transport in TiO2 and electron collection in the FTO glass. However, this simultaneously accelerates the recombination as well (Fig. 6c), typically by accelerating the recombination of photo-generated electrons in TiO2 and holes (Sn2−) in the electrolyte (process 1), which is supposed to be the main pathway of electron loss in the device, thus leading to lower electron lifetimes. Given that all the other components of the devices are the same except for the electrolyte systems, it is expected that the existence of SiO2 NPs on the CdSexTe1−x QDs surface and the QD-free TiO2 surface can prevent the direct contact between TiO2 and the polysulfide electrolyte or between the QDs and the polysulfide electrolyte, thus suppressing the photo-generated electron recombination. Fig. 6c gives the main charge recombination pathways in the QDSCs, and the role of the SiO2 additive in CdSexTe1−x based QDSCs is also illustrated clearly. After the branched aggregates comprising fumed SiO2 are dispersed in the polysulfide electrolyte, a three-dimensional (3-D) network gel structure is formed, and some SiO2 NPs can be adsorbed on the surfaces of TiO2 and the QDs (Fig. S2†). This creates a thin barrier that inhibits election injection from the TiO2/QDs into the electrolyte (process 1 and 3) and from TiO2 into the QDs (process 2 and 4), thus decreasing the interfacial charge recombination and leading to a significant enhancement of the cell performance. Therefore, under the same illumination intensity, Dn and τIMVSn are higher for the CdSexTe1−x QDSC with the SiO2 NPs-modified electrolyte than those with the conventional polysulfide electrolyte. Furthermore, the charge collection efficiency (ηcol) of the QDSCs is also calculated by following the relationship of ηcc = 1 − τd/τIMVSn, as shown in Fig. 6b. It can be seen that ηcc for the CdSexTe1−x QDSC with the SiO2 NPs-modified electrolyte is in the range of 98.5–98.7% under varied light intensities, which is higher than the corresponding device with the conventional polysulfide electrolyte (87.2–91.1%). For sensitized solar cells, Jsc of the cell can be described by Jsc = q × ηLH × ηinj × ηcol × Io, where q is the elementary charge, ηLH is the light-harvesting efficiency, ηinj is the charge-injection efficiency, ηcol is the charge collection efficiency and Io is the incident photon flux. For our devices with different electrolytes under the same fabrication process and testing conditions, Jsc is proportional to the product of ηinj and ηcol while q, ηLH and Io are assumed to be constant. Furthermore, due to the existence of SiO2 NPs on the surfaces of the uncoated TiO2 and QDs, a barrier may be created to inhibit electron injection from the QDs into the electrolyte and the injected electrons from TiO2 into the electrolyte, which can enhance ηinj and ηcol, respectively. This is obviously in good agreement with the increased Jsc and prominent photovoltaic performance. One thing that needs to be addressed is that the electron lifetimes of the QDSCs, calculated by EIS or IMVS measurements, are not exactly the same due to different detailed measurement conditions. Specifically, the EIS measurements are carried out in the dark while the IMVS measurements are carried out under weak monochromatic light illumination. However, these values in the same order are quite reasonable.

Conclusions
In summary, SiO2 NPs were introduced into a polysulfide electrolyte to regulate the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface of CdSexTe1−x QDSCs for the first time. Unlike a conventional gel electrolyte, the fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) have been significantly enhanced in addition to the cell performance. Furthermore, the stability of the device has also been improved. With the aid of time-resolution photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements, the electron transport and recombination processes in the CdSexTe1−x QDSCs based on SiO2 modified electrolytes were investigated. It was revealed that the existence of SiO2 NPs on the surfaces of TiO2 and QDs can create an energy barrier for electron injection from the QDs into the electrolyte and the injected electron from TiO2 into the electrolyte, thus effectively inhibiting photo-generated electron recombination. Furthermore, CdSexTe1−x QDSCs based on SiO2 modified electrolytes were found to exhibit higher electron collection efficiency (98%) and longer electron lifetimes. A PCE of 11.23% has been achieved with a certified PCE of 11.3%, which is one of the highest efficiencies achieved for liquid-junction QDSCs. This work provides a simple and convenient method to modify the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interfaces of QDSCs.
Experimental
Reagents and materials
Thioglycolic acid (TGA, 97%), oleic acid (90%), cadmium oxide (CdO, 99.99%), and selenium powder (99.999%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar Chemicals. Tellurium powder (200 meshes, 98%) was purchased from Aldrich. Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (99+%), Na2S·9H2O (98+%), sulfur (99.5+%), KCl (99.5+%), paraffin, polyethylene glycol (PEG) (2000) and PEG (20000) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., while oleylamine (OAm, 80–90%) was purchased from Aladdin. Fumed silica and P25 was purchased from Degussa. All the chemicals were used without further purification. The electrode substrate was fluorine-doped tin oxide conducting glass (FTO, thickness: 2.2 mm, Pilkington, sheet resistance 14 Ω per square). Before use, the FTO glass was first washed with mild detergent, rinsed with distilled water several times and subsequently with ethanol in an ultrasonic bath, and finally dried under an air stream.
Synthesis of CdSexTe1−x alloyed QDs
CdSexTe1−x alloyed QDs were prepared according to the literature.14,32 Briefly, 0.1 M Te and Se stock solutions (Te or Se powders were dissolved in TOP and paraffin (v/v, 1:3)) and a 0.1 M Cd precursor solution (CdO dissolved in oleic acid and paraffin (1:3)) were mixed in a 50 mL three-necked flask in a Cd:Se:Te molar ratio of 25:4:1. The mixture was heated to 320 °C under the protection of an N2 atmosphere and was kept at this temperature for 6 min. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled down to 250 °C, followed by the addition of 2 mL of OAm into the reaction system. It was kept at this temperature for 5 min, and was finally cooled down to the room temperature. The reaction procedure was monitored using fluorescence spectra. The as-prepared CdSexTe1−x solution was further purified by precipitation and centrifugation with the addition of acetone and methanol. For the TEM characterization, the CdSexTe1−x QDs were dispersed in CH2Cl2 and dropped onto a copper net. The water soluble QDs were obtained by ligand exchange as described in the literature.14 2.0 mmol of TGA was dissolved in 1.0 mL of methanol, and the pH value was adjusted to 10 with 30% NaOH solution. This was subsequently added into 10 mL of CdSexTe1−x QDs CH2Cl2 solution. The mixture was stirred for 2 h to afford the TGA-capped QD precipitation, which was then extracted with 10 mL deionized water. The CdSexTe1−x QD aqueous solution was then further purified by using acetone as precipitator. Finally, the TGA-capped CdSexTe1−x QD aqueous solution (0.05 M) was obtained.
Fabrication of CdSexTe1−x alloyed QD-sensitized solar cells
A double layer TiO2 photoanode was deposited onto a FTO substrate by using a screen printing technique. The photoanode consisted of a 15 μm-thickness transparent layer composed of P25 TiO2 particles and a 6 μm-thickness light-scattering layer comprising a mixture of 300 nm rutile TiO2 particles and 20 nm anatase TiO2 particles in a weight ratio of 7:3. Typically, a viscous paste was prepared by dispersing TiO2 particles in α-terpineol with ethyl cellulose (EC) added as a binder in the same proportion by weight. After each deposition, the TiO2 layer was first dried at 80 °C for 30 min, and then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min.
40 μL of 0.05 M CdSexTe1−x alloyed QD solution was dropped onto the TiO2 photoanode surface in air to ensure that the TiO2 film was fully infiltrated, which had been rinsed first with deionized water, then with ethanol and finally dried under an air stream. Then, TiCl4 treatment was carried out according to the literature, that is, the CdSexTe1−x alloyed QD-sensitized photoanodes were immersed into TiCl4 aqueous solution (consisting of 0.01 M TiCl4 and 0.01 M TGA) for 30 min at 50 °C, followed by rinsing with water and ethanol sequentially.37 Finally, the as-prepared electrodes were passivated with ZnS by immersing 4 times into 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2 and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution for 1 min alternately. For the TEM characterization, CdSexTe1−x QDs were directly deposited onto bare TiO2 films. The polysulfide electrolytes consist of 2 M Na2S, 2 M S powder and 0.2 M KCl in water containing different concentrations of SiO2 and PEG. Cu2S counter electrodes were prepared on brass sheets according to the literature.41 The CdSexTe1−x QD-coated photoanode and Cu2S electrode were clamped with polysulfide electrolyte (2 M Na2S, 2 M S and 0.2 M KCl) inside, to give a sandwich-type cell, in which a 50 μm thick thermoplastic spacer was used to separate the two electrodes. To seal the cells, a CuS counter electrode was used, which was prepared according to the literature.25
To study the cell stability, CuS was used to replace traditional Cu2S as a counter electrode for sealing the cells.38 The sealed cells were prepared by sealing the CuS counter electrode, QD-sensitized FTO/TiO2 photoanode and polysulfide electrolyte using a thermoplastic spacer. Long-term stability tests for the sealed CdSexTe1−x QDSCs were carried out. For this, the solar cells were stored in air at room light illumination, and were tested every two days for 42 days.
Characterization
The optical properties were measured using UV-Vis spectroscopy (Shimadzu, UV2550). Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were obtained using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F97 Pro, Shanghai Lengguang Tech). Time-resolved photoluminescence decay spectra were carried out on PL Spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 900), excited with a picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL-445). The morphology of CdSexTe1−x QD-coated TiO2 was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F20 Super-twin). Samples for TEM investigation were prepared by scraping the TiO2 nanoparticles with CdSexTe1−x QDs from the FTO substrate and dispersed them in ethanol solution, followed by transferring several drops of the suspension solution onto a carbon-coated copper grid. The ionic conductivities of the different electrolytes were determined using an ac impedance technique on a Princeton Applied Research Versa STAT 3 from 5 Hz to 3 MHz at room temperature, employing a DJS-1C conductance electrode.
The cells were irradiated by a SS150-A, Zolix under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2), while the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for the cells were recorded on a Princeton Applied Research Model 263A. To measure the J–V characteristics, a mask with a window of 0.12 cm2 was clipped onto the TiO2 side to define the photoactive area of the cell. The incident light intensity was measured using a radiant power/energy meter (Oriel70260). The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was obtained using a direct current (dc) method, with a lab-made IPCE setup under 0.3–0.9 mW cm−2 monochromic light illumination without bias illumination.50,51 Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained on a Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation under dark conditions at forward bias ranging from 100 mV to 600 mV in the frequency range from 105 to 0.1 Hz. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted using Zview software in terms of an appropriate equivalent circuit. Intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) was carried on a Zahner CIMPS system, using a green LED with wavelength at 530 nm, which supplied stationary and sinusoidal modulated light on the samples. The LED worked at the potentiostatic mode, and the applied alternating ac current amplitude was 10% of the stationary direct current (dc) value.
