    , Accepted 5th December 2019First published on 6th December 2019AbstractWe report a new series of wide band-gap small organic molecules as donor-materials featuring an indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT) core and fluorinated thiophene linkers for solution-processed organic solar cells. Two isomeric aliphatic groups were introduced as side chains on the IDT units (coded I4FR-O and I4FR-EH). These donors have been systematically characterized and employed in bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices cooperating with a PC70BM electron acceptor. Replacing the linear alkyl group (n-octyl) in the IDT core with a branched constitutional isomer (2-ethylhexyl) results in a remarkable improvement in the performance of OPV devices: the optimized power conversion efficiencies of 2.10% and 4.30% were achieved for I4FR-O and I4FR-EH, respectively. Such wide efficiency gap can be partly attributed to a preferable morphology in the donor-fullerene blends of I4FR-EHvia such side-chain engineering.
Introduction
Organic electron donating materials, a pivotal component of bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPVs), have attracted enormous attention since OPVs started thriving in 1995.1–3 As the most successful and representative donor materials for OPVs, polymers have been extensively and comprehensively investigated both in academic research and commercial applications.4–8 However, the unpredictable batch-to-batch variation is always an insolvable problem that limits their development even though their high-performance and long-term stability still remains dominant.9,10
In the last decade, solution processed small molecular (SM) donors have attracted enormous attention because they can be precisely synthesized and purified by standard procedures with excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility, which is apparently advantageous in large-scale applications of OPVs compared with their polymer-counterparts.11–13 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10%14–16 have been respectively achieved for single-junction SM OPVs, which is comparable to the performance of the polymer-based ones. In order to design promising SM donor materials, a most common and successful approach is to connect electron-deficient end-cappers and an electron-rich core via a π-bridge in one molecule to construct an A–π–D–π–A structured compound with reduced HOMO–LUMO gap. This design strategy has enlightened extensive research on incorporating different electron-donating and -accepting moieties into materials.17,18 Amongst those subunits, one of the most commonly employed donor units is indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT), which has been widely used in both D–A polymers and small molecules for OPV device fabrications. Its unique rigid ring-fused structure and orthogonal side chains can guarantee both high carrier mobility and good solubility that enable solution processes. Although the energy levels of IDT-based molecules are barely decided by the side chains, these flexible solubilizing groups attached to the aromatic core still play an irreplaceable role when designing an SM donor. They not only control the solubility and stability of the donor compounds, but also decisively affect the aggregation pattern and morphologies of donor/acceptor blend films, which directly determines the fill factor (FF) and therefore the efficiency of devices.19–21 Yet not too much data has been reported to discuss the side-chain-performance relationship in IDT-based SM donors. Here we designed and synthesized two IDT-based SM donors with identical conjugated central cores and two isomeric alkyl groups (n-octyl and 2-ethylhexyl) attached to the IDT core. Recently, incorporation of fluorine substituted units into conjugated backbones has emerged as a widely-accepted strategy to improve the PCE, which has been described as assisting the development of inter/intra-molecular interactions that influence thin-film morphologies and as increasing charge carrier lifetimes by mitigating Coulombic interactions.22–24 Therefore, we deliberately introduced a 3,4-diflurothienyl group into the conjugate backbones as part of the π-bridge for better co-planarity and PV performance. A classic 3-ethylrodanine was chosen as the end-capping group for completion of the two new SM donors. Herein their photophysical properties and photovoltaic data are investigated in detail with the aid of theoretical calculations (Fig. 1).

Experimental section
Equipment and materials

1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 19F NMR spectra were measured with Avance III Ultrashield Plus instruments (400 MHz or 600 MHz) in CDCl3 or CD2Cl2. UV-vis absorption spectrometry was performed on a PerkinElmer Lambda 365 spectrophotometer. The electrochemical behaviors of the dyes were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) on a CHI660e electrochemical workstation. HR-MS spectra were recorded with a Thermo Scientific-LTQ Velos Orbitrap MS.
All reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Solvents were distilled with appropriate drying agents prior to use. Commercially available reagents were used without further purification unless otherwise stated. Compound 1,255,26 and 627 were prepared according to previous reports.
Fabrication and measurement of OPVs
The BHJ solar cells were prepared on glass substrates with tin-doped indium oxide (ITO, 15 Ω sq−1) patterned on the surface (device area: 0.1 cm2). The substrates were prewashed with isopropanol to remove organic residues before immersing in an ultrasonic bath of dilute Extran® 300 for 15 min. The substrates were rinsed in flowing deionized water for 5 min before being sonicated (Branson 5510) for 15 min each in successive baths of deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. Then they were dried with pressurized nitrogen before being exposed to a UV–ozone plasma for 15 min. Meanwhile, a precursor solution of zinc acetate dihydrate (200 mg), 2-methoxyethanol (4 mL), and ethanolamine (55 μL) was prepared and stirred vigorously in ambient atmosphere for at least 12 h. For the fabrication of direct devices, a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (∼35 nm) (Clevios AL4083) was spun-cast onto the UV-treated substrates, and the PEDOT:PSS-coated substrates were subsequently annealed on a hot plate at 150 °C for 15 min, and then transferred into a glovebox for active layer deposition. All solutions with the fullerene acceptor PC70BM (purchased from Solarmer) and the fluorinated molecular donors I4FR-O or I4FR-EH were prepared in the glovebox. PC70BM and the donors were dissolved in chlorobenzene, and the solutions were stirred at 50 °C for at least 4 h. Optimized devices were prepared using blend solutions with a concentration of 15 mg mL−1, and a PC70BM:SM donor ratio of 7:3 (wt:wt) with I4FR-O and I4FR-EH. The active layers were spun-cast from the blend solutions at 50 °C at an optimized spin speed of 4000 rpm for 45 s, using a programmable spin-coater from Specialty Coating Systems (Model G3P-8), resulting in films of ca. 50 nm in thickness. The samples were then dried under vacuum for at least 1 h. The samples were placed in a thermal evaporator for evaporation of a 4 nm thick calcium (Ca) layer evaporated at 0.2 Å s−1, and a 80 nm thick layer of aluminum (Al) evaporated at 5 Å s−1 for direct devices under a pressure of less than 2 × 10−6 Torr.

J–V measurements of solar cells were performed in the glovebox with a Keithley 2400 source meter and an Oriel Sol3A Class AAA solar simulator calibrated to AM1.5G, with a KG-5 silicon reference cell certified by Newport. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed at zero bias by illuminating the device with monochromatic light supplied from a Xenon arc lamp in combination with a dual-grating monochromator. The number of photons incident on the sample was calculated for each wavelength by using a silicon photodiode calibrated by NIST.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route is depicted in Scheme 1. The first key intermediate, terthiophene 2, was obtained using a Stille coupling reaction. Then bromination with NBS produced dibromo-terthiophene 3 in high yield. When synthesizing the carboxaldehyde 4, at first n-BuLi was used to perform a halogen-exchange reaction from dibromo-terthiophene 3, with the electrophilic aldehyde source anhydrous DMF. But this condition resulted in a brownish to black solution with only a trace amount of the target product. After switching the n-BuLi with Turbo Grignard reagent iPrMgCl·LiCl, carboxaldehyde 4 was successfully prepared with a satisfactory yield. Next, synthon 4 was assembled with organotin reagents 5 and 6 respectively via Stille-coupling, to form di-carboxaldehyde 7 and 8. Once obtained, the symmetrical segments 7 and 8 were subjected to Knoevenagel condensation with 3-ethylrhodanine to yield the SM donors I4FR-O and I4FR-EH, isolated as purple-bluish dyes. Both I4FR-O and I4FR-EH showed excellent solubility in chloroform and chlorobenzene, although the linear-alkyl-group attached SM donor I4FR-O shows a little bit lower propensity to dissolve in solution than its counterpart. All the intermediates and target dyes were characterized by standard spectroscopic methods as described in the ESI.†

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the two dyes in solution and in neat films are presented in Fig. 2, and the related numeric data are presented in Table 1. As can be seen, the two SM donors exhibited almost identical absorption profiles. Only a marginal difference was observed that the linear side chain alkylated I4FR-O showed a subtle redshift (≈5 nm) compared with its isomer both in chloroform and in neat films. In diluted solution, the absorption band located around 300 nm corresponds to the π–π* transition of the conjugated skeleton; and the broader and more intensive band in the lower energy region (around 450 nm) is assigned to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the electron-donating core (IDT) and electron-withdrawing terminal group (3-ethylrhodanine). After forming films, a drastic bathochromic shift (up to 90 nm) and broadening of the absorption spectra was observed for I4FR-O and I4FR-EH. This is quite unusual in previously reported IDT-based organic semiconductors, and most of them exhibit redshifts less than 50 nm from the solution state to the film state because the orthogonal side chains in the IDT core could sabotage the self-aggregation of the molecule. However in our design, the introduction of two fluorinated terthiophene linkers effectively enhanced the coplanarity and π–π stacking of the molecule, thus improving the light-harvesting intensity in the visible region of the SM donor which would surely benefit the photoelectrical conversion efficiency of OPV devices. As represented in Fig. S1 (ESI†), DFT calculations also verified that π-delocalization extends across the SM donors, with only minimal dihedral angles (<1°) between consecutive motifs – a pattern conducive to π-aggregation in films.

The redox behaviors of SM donors were studied by cyclic voltammetry (in Fig. 3 and Table 1). The measurements were taken in a solution of 0.1 M TBAPF6 in dichloromethane. A three-electrode cell containing of a Pt-rod working electrode, Pt wire counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode was employed. The ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was used as an internal reference. Prior to the measurements, all solutions were degassed with high-purity argon.

Being consistent with the negligible variations in the electronic absorption features given by UV-vis tests, two SM donors gave very similar values of onset oxidative potentials (≈ 0.7 V) which can be attributed to the oxidation of an alkylated IDT core. The corresponding HOMO energy levels are located at 5.12 eV and 5.13 eV for I4FR-O and I4FR-EH, respectively. Consequently, the LUMO energy levels of around 3.26 eV were calculated from the HOMO energy levels and the optical band gaps of the molecules (Eopt). It is also noteworthy that I4FR-EH exhibited reversible oxidation couples, which indicated that it has enhanced electrochemical stability in contrast with I4FR-O. In addition, photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) was also used to determine the Ionization Potentials (IPs) of the SM donors (Fig. S2, ESI†), and the results followed the same trends with CV measurements.
Photovoltaic performances
Thin-film BHJ solar cells were fabricated with the direct configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SM:PC70BM/Ca/Al (device area: 0.1 cm2, Fig. 4a), and tested under simulated AM1.5G sun illumination (100 mW cm−2); detailed experimental protocols are provided in the ESI.†Table 2 summarizes the figures of merit of optimized BHJ devices made from blends of SM donors, I4FR-EH and I4FR-O, in the presence of PC70BM, with and without solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment with the low-partial-pressure solvent dichloromethane (DCM), which has been shown to improve the blend morphologies of BHJ solar cells made with SM donors and PCBM acceptors and, in turn, device PCEs.

It is important to note, however, that solvents inducing morphological variations to the active layers can also result in reduced device performance figures, and that the outcome of these tentative optimization steps remains SM system-dependent. As described in Table 2, the “as-cast” devices made from I4FR-EH:PC70BM show short-circuit current (JSC) of 8.3 cm−2 mA and open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.9 V, with low fill factor (FF) of 35%, yielding a device power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.6%. For the I4FR-O:PC70BM BHJ device under the “as-cast” conditions, a rather low PCE of 1.7% is given, along with solar cell parameters JSC, VOC and FF of 5.7 cm−2 mA, 0.86 V, and 30%, respectively. The solar cell performances for I4FR-EH and I4FR-O are shown to be <3%, mainly limited by FF (40%). In turn, optimized devices made from I4FR-EH blends subjected to SVA treatment with solvent DCM for annealing time 20 s show improved FF of 48%, with retained VOC (0.9 V) and JSC (9.3 cm−2 mA), achieving PCE of max. 4.3% (avg. 3.9%). Similarly, the optimized I4FR-O:PC70BM BHJ solar cells (DCM SVA for 20 s) exhibit the PCE of ∼2%, with concurrently limited improved JSC and FF (Table 2).
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of optimized BHJ devices made from I4FR-EH and I4FR-O are overlaid in Fig. 4c. In Fig. 4c, the optimized I4FR-O based device shows a modest QE spectrum, with an average EQE of 34% across the region of 350–600 nm wavelength. In the same figure for the I4FR-EH blend device under optimized conditions, obviously enhanced EQE values of avg. ∼50% in the same wavelength (350–600 nm) are observed, with the max. point of the EQE (63%) at 410 nm. The EQE results suggest that, compared to the I4FR-O BHJ devices, the I4FR-EH based devices have higher photocurrent conversion from incoming photons, contributing to more generated photocurrents in the optimized devices, which is in agreement with the JSC in Table 2. Given in Fig. 4d, the dependence on the effective optical absorption of the active layer is removed in comparing the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) spectra of the I4FR-EH and I4FR-O BHJ solar cells; experimental details described in the ESI† (Fig. S3). The IQE spectra parallel the EQE curves, with IQE values of ∼60% across the range 350–600 nm for the I4FR-O based device, and >70% in the range from 350–600 nm for the I4FR-EH:PC70BM device, where >80% IQE values can be observed throughout 400–570 nm. In brief, results from IQE analyses indicate that most absorbed photons are conducive to free carrier generation and effective collection at the electrodes in the I4FR-EH:PC70BM BHJ device, whereas the device made from I4FR-O with modest IQE may be hindered by substantial carrier recombination (and/or exciton quenching) events.
To analyze the efficiency of exciton diffusion and charge transfer at the donor–acceptor interfaces between the SM donor and PC70BM domains, we turned to an examination of the BHJ active layers made from the “as-cast” and optimized conditions in a set of photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments. Since the spectral absorption and PL patterns of I4FR-EH/I4FR-O and PC70BM lie in regions of distinct wavelengths, the SM donors can be individually excited (excitation wavelengths: 550 for both SM donors), thus acquiring the quenching information for the SM blends, compared with the neat SM donors. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the near-complete PL quenching of I4FR-EH and I4FR-O in the presence of PC70BM (>97% in all instances) implies that most of the excitons formed in the donor counterparts diffuse to the donor–acceptor interfaces and undergo dissociation.

In a BHJ device under illumination, free charge carriers, after charge transfer, will be generated and collected at the electrodes before experiencing recombination, in most cases, bimolecular recombination. To characterize such carrier recombination, the light-intensity dependence measurements for examining JSC inferred from the J–V curves as a function of light intensity are employed. In these experiments, a white-light LED (200 mW cm−2; spectral mismatch accounted for; cf. experimental details in the ESI†) is used to reproduce the JSC values normally obtained under standard AM1.5G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2). Generally, the relationship between JSC and incident light intensity (I) can be described as: JSC ∝ Iα, whereby α = 1 suggests that all dissociated free carriers are swept out prior to recombination and α < 1 implies a dependence of JSC on bimolecular recombination (i.e. most carriers are extracted prior to recombining). From the JSCvs. light intensity data reported in Fig. 5c, the fits yield α values of 0.91 for the I4FR-EH BHJ solar cell –indicative of the fact that I4FR-EH based devices suffer from a minor extent of bimolecular recombination losses under short-circuit conditions; for the I4FR-O based cells, however, deviated α values (0.83) suggest that a more evident bimolecular loss prevails within the solar cells. Moreover, carrier losses during the charge transport may encounter another recombination incident: trap-assisted recombination. Fig. 5d examining the variation of VOCvs. light intensity points to the existence of carrier traps across the active layers, with deviations from the linear relationship δVOC = nkT/qln(I) (trap-free condition) reflecting trap-assisted recombination. As illustrated in Fig. 5d, both of the devices for I4FR-EH and I4FR-O show fitting values close to 1.2, which point out the existence of non-negligible traps in the devices. These findings throughout the recombination detection imply that relatively implicit bimolecular loss is observed in I4FR-EH BHJ solar cells, while I4FR-O based devices suffer from an apparent bimolecular recombination. Meanwhile, devices made from both SM donors in conjunction with PC70BM reveal the traps residing in the solar cells, accounting for the FF and JSC differences, in agreement with the device performance metrics and EQE and IQE data summarized in Fig. 4 and Table 2.
Morphology and charge transport characterization
Carrier recombination events that occurred in the device can be correlated with the active layer morphology, which can be examined by bright-field electron transmission microscopy. The BHJ morphologies of the “as-cast” devices made with I4FR-EH and I4FR-O, and those obtained from films under optimized conditions (SVA treatment; conditions identical to those laid out in Table 2), are thus imaged by TEM to acquire the BHJ morphology. In Fig. 6a and b, thin film morphology made from I4FR-EH and PC70BM under the “as-cast” condition presents obvious aggregations across the film, with an I4FR-EH-rich domain size of >200 nm. Under optimized conditions for the I4FR-EH film, we find out that the large-scale morphology dramatically decreased to a finely-mixed pattern, showing <20 nm donor phase sizes. (Here, the fullerenes are also mixed with SM donors, suggesting that they shall have reduced domain sizes.) Turning to I4FR-O BHJ thin film in Fig. 6c and d, the same pattern from the “as-cast” to optimized conditions is observed, with domain sizes decreasing from >200 nm to <100 nm. However, the agglomerations in Fig. 6d remain discernable throughout the active layer (20–60 nm), pointing to the mixed morphology of fine mix and clusters. Overall, the TEM analyses reveal that the BHJ morphology in I4FR-EH:PC70BM blends shows a fine donor–acceptor mixture upon SVA treatment, suitable for excitons to reach D/A interfaces with favored carrier generation and percolation which are required for efficient transport and extraction. In the optimized I4FR-O BHJ thin film, however, the diffused I4FR-O clusters across the active layer evidence the unfavorable morphology, which correlates with the early examination in recombination analyses (Fig. 5), which agreed with the photovoltaic performance in Table 2.

The relatively low FF (here <50% in optimized BHJs) of I4FR-O and I4FR-EH molecules can originate from limitations of the charge transport, which can be probed by space-charge-limited current (SCLC) mobility measurements (cf. details in the ESI,† Table S1 and Fig. S4). The zero-field hole mobilities of I4FR-EH-based BHJs is 1.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, slightly higher than observed for I4FR-O BHJs (1.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The electron mobilities in I4FR-EH and I4FR-O-based BHJs under optimized conditions are 1.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1vs. 1.59 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Overall, I4FR-EH-based BHJs exhibit more balanced electron and hole mobilities than I4FR-O, but their carrier mobility estimates remain more modest than values established for those high-performance SM/polymer donor based active layers,28,29 and can thus contribute to the FF limitation in BHJ solar cells.
Conclusions
In summary, a new kind of wide band-gap organic donor featuring an indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT) core and fluorinated thiophene linkers was developed for solution-processed organic solar cells. We found that replacing the linear alkyl group (n-octyl) in the IDT core with a branched isomer (2-ethylhexyl) leads to a significant improvement in photovoltaic performance (from 2.10% to 4.30%) with an appropriate optimization protocol (SVA). Across the systematic examinations on recombination and morphology inspections, I4FR-EH shows low bimolecular recombination and a fine-mixed network in BHJ morphology, superior to I4FR-O with non-negligible bimolecular and trap-induced recombination, as well as an unfavorable morphology with discernable aggregation.
