    , Accepted 3rd November 2021First published on 9th November 2021AbstractSingle-component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) have been recognized as a promising photovoltaic technology due to their excellent stability, but their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are far lagging behind those of the bulk-heterojunction counterparts. Current strategies have mainly focused on new polymer backbones and pendent acceptors, while linkers are ignored. Here, we develop a new semiflexible linker consisting of a triazole unit and an alkyl chain via a Click reaction between alkyne and azide end groups, which is different from the alkyl linkers in previous reports. Two new polymers, P1 and P2, with different linker lengths (C6H12-triazole for P1 and C12H24-triazole for P2) were developed. The optical properties, energy levels, photovoltaic performance and morphology of the two polymers were systematically studied and compared with those of a similar alkyl chain linked polymer JP02. Unfortunately, both polymer-based SCOSC devices exhibited low PCEs due to the lower short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factors (FF) than those of the JP02 based cells, which may be ascribed to the decreased charge transporting properties originated from the increased π–π stacking distance of the two polymers. Our work will offer a new strategy to design new double-cable polymers for SCOSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have gained rapid progress in recent years with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 18% due to the material innovation of near-infrared electron acceptors.1–5 When considering the industrial application of OSCs, the triangle of efficiency, stability and cost should be universally considered. Nowadays, high-efficiency OSCs use two-component organic semiconductors as the photoactive layer, including electron donors and acceptors. It has been reported that a physically-mixed donor and acceptor have the tendency to be phase-separated into large-domain size, which is detrimental to the performance and lowers the stability of OSCs.6 As an alternative, single-component OSCs (SCOSCs) use a single conjugated material in the photoactive layer, in which the electron donor and acceptor are chemically-bonded into one material, so that the self-aggregation tendency of donor and acceptor can be perfectly solved.7,8 This means that SCOSCs show promising application in industry.9–11 Although SCOSCs have been studied for over two decades since first reported in 1996,12 the PCEs gained a slow increment of 2–3% before 2017.13–17 In recent years, some new conjugated materials have emerged, enabling the PCEs of SCOSCs to be boosted to over 8%.18,19 Among them, double-cable conjugated polymers that use the electron donor as conjugated backbone and the electron acceptor as side units have played an important role in SCOSCs.10
In the early stage of the studies, polythiophene and fullerene derivatives were usually used as the electron donor and acceptor to construct double-cable conjugated polymers.15,16,20,21 The difficulty to tune the molecular structures and the narrow absorption band in these polymers limited their application in SCOSCs. Later, we used a “functionalization-polymerization” strategy to synthesize double-cable conjugated polymers, in which “donor–acceptor” conjugated polymers and rylene bisimides, such as naphthalene diimides (NDIs) and perylene bisimides, could be selected as donor backbone and acceptor side units.10,22,23 This enables double-cable conjugated polymers to show tunable absorption, energy levels and crystallinity, so that their application into SCOSCs provided PCEs of over 8%.18 Further enhancement of the PCEs in SCOSCs will need the continuous innovation of single-component conjugated materials, such as new synthetic methods and new structures.
It is noticeable that, nowadays, double-cable monomers used for polymerization are usually obtained from tetra-bromo substituted compounds, in which two bromo atoms located at the end of the side chains are used for the growth of rylene bisimides with the formation of C–N bonds.23 This will limit the introduction of electron acceptors if C–N bonds are absent in some compounds. Therefore, in this work, we used the Click reaction to develop a new semiflexible linker (as the connecting unit between the donor backbone and acceptor side units), in which two precursors containing alkyne and azide end groups were used (Fig. 1a). It is worth noting that the semiflexible linkers contain triazole units, which is different from the alkyl linkers in previous reports. The length of the linkers was also adjusted in the new polymers, from the C6H12-triazole for P1 to the C12H24-triazole for P2, to study their effect on the photovoltaic performance. We systematically studied the physical properties of the two new polymers, and the double-cable polymer JP0218 with C12H24 as the linker was used for comparison (Fig. 1b).

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the monomers and polymers P1 and P2 are presented in Scheme 1. The detailed synthetic procedures of compounds 2, 5, 6, M1 and M2 are shown in the Experimental section. Compounds 3 and 4 were synthesized according to the literature,22 and compounds 1 and M3 are commercially available. The polymers P1 and P2 were obtained via Stille polymerization with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. As determined by high temperature gel-permeation chromatography (GPC), both P1 and P2 exhibited high number-average molecular weights (Mn) of 157.5 kDa and 78.6 kDa, with polydispersity indexes (PDIs) of 2.28 and 4.00, respectively (Fig. S1†). The thermal stability was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. S2,† the two polymers are stable below 300 °C, revealing excellent thermal stability.

2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
As shown in Fig. 2a, P1 and P2 exhibit similar absorption spectra in thin films with JP02, where the bands at 300–400 nm and 500–700 nm are ascribed to the absorption of NDI side units and the backbone of PClBDB-T, respectively (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, the absorption intensity of P2 at 300–400 nm is slightly higher compared with that of P1, both in solution and in thin films (Fig. 2a and Fig. S3b†), while the difference is negligible in their monomers M1 and M2 (Fig. S3a†). This might be due to the different aggregated behaviors in polymers P1 and P2. The frontier energy levels of the two polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. As shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. S3,†P1 and P2 have identical highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO: −5.49/−5.50 eV) levels and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO: −3.50/−3.49 eV) levels. We can also observe that both the HOMO and LUMO levels of the two new polymers are higher than those of JP02, which seems unreasonable since P1 and P2 have identical conjugated backbones and NDI side units with those of JP02. We will provide some studies about this issue in the following section.

2.3. Photovoltaic properties
The two double-cable polymers P1 and P2 were then applied into SCOSCs with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/polymer/MoO3/Ag. The solvents, additives, thicknesses of films and thermal annealing temperature for the active layers were synthetically optimized to obtain the best devices. As demonstrated in Fig. 3a and Table 1, both the P1 and P2 films were fabricated from chlorobenzene (CB) solution with annealing at 150 °C for 10 minutes. The best device based on P1 showed a low PCE of 1.39% together with a low short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 5.00 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.80 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.35. The P2-based device exhibited a relatively high PCE of 2.03% with a Jsc of 6.05 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.81 V and FF of 0.42. The photovoltaic performance can also be reflected by external quantum efficiencies (EQEs). According to Fig. 3b, the EQE of the P2-based device can be up to 0.41, which is much higher than that of the P1-based device (0.32).

To better understand the relationship between charge transport properties and the performance of devices, space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were carried out to investigate the charge carrier mobilities of P1 and P2 based devices. The hole mobility was tested by using a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/MoO3/Ag, and the electron mobility was obtained with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/polymer/PDINO/Ag. The detailed mobilities are shown in Fig. 3e, f and Table 1, in which P1 and P2 exhibit similar hole mobilities of 1.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. However, the electron mobility of P1 based devices (1.95 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) is much lower than that of P2 based devices (6.67 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), which explains its lower Jsc. Besides, P2 based devices exhibited balanced hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe = 1.80), while the ratio of μh/μe in P1 based devices was 8.10. The results revealed that both P1 and P2 have relatively low charge carrier mobilities, resulting in low PCEs of the SCOSCs. Moreover, the more balanced hole/electron transporting behavior is ascribed to alleviating the charge recombination and further enhancing the FFs of P2 based cells.
Another interesting issue is the significantly lower Vocs in P1 and P2 based SCOSCs compared to that in JP02-based cells (0.94 V).18 Looking into the CV results, both HOMO and LUMO levels in P1 and P2 are upshifted compared to those in JP02, so Vocs that are determined by the HOMO and LUMO levels in P1 and P2 based cells should be similar to those in JP02. With this question, we further provide studies about the charge transfer state (CTs) by using electroluminescence (EL) and sensitive EQE (sEQE) measurements (Fig. 4). Before analysis, we used the intersection of absorption and photoluminescence (PL) to accurately determine the optical band gaps (Egs) (Fig. 4a, b and Table 2). The energy of the CTs (ECTs) determined from EL and sEQE are 1.57 and 1.60 eV, which are quite similar to that of JP02 (1.55 eV). This is understandable since all of them have the same conjugated backbone and side units. However, non-radiative voltage losses (qVnon-radoc), determined by measuring the electroluminescence EQE of the solar cells, were found to be 0.42 eV for P1 and P2-based solar cells (Table 2). This is ∼0.10 eV higher than that of JP02-based solar cells, which explains the low Vocs in P1 and P2 based cells. Since non-radiative voltage loss strongly depends on the chemical structures and aggregated state in thin films, we therefore conclude that the different Vocs between P1/P2 and JP02 cells might originate from the different morphology in these films. This would also explain their different HOMO and LUMO levels (Fig. 2b).

2.4. Morphology studies
The morphologies and crystalline properties of active layers were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. According to the AFM images in Fig. 5, both the P1 and P2 films showed a smooth surface and small domain size with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.94 nm and 0.86 nm, respectively. The crystalline properties were further investigated by GIWAXS, as shown in Fig. 6 and Table 3. Both P1 and P2 exhibited a typical “face-on” orientation. In the in-plane (IP) direction, both P1 and P2 have similar diffraction peaks of q1 and q2 as those of JP02 polymers. However, the q001 peak appeared in the IP direction of P2 polymer, while it disappeared for the P1 film, considering the different intensity ratios of P1 and P2.18 The d-spacing of P2 is almost equal to that of JP02 and the d-spacing of P1 is lower than that of JP02 due to the shorter linkers between the donor backbone and NDI side units. The coherence length (CL) of JP02 is higher than that of P1 and lower than that of P2, indicating the degree of crystallinity is in the order of P2 > JP02 > P1. As for the out of plane (OOP) direction, only the typical two-order diffraction peaks were observed (q1 and q2). Meanwhile, the d-spacings were 0.37 nm for peak q010 of the P1 and P2 films, which is higher than that of the polymer JP02 (0.364 nm). Meanwhile, the CL value of peak q010 for P2 is larger than that for P1, agreeing with the order of crystallinity in the IP direction and explaining the higher mobilities of P2.

From the AFM and GIWAXS results, it is hard to explain the distinct performance between P1/P2 and JP02 cells, since they show a similar morphology in the crystalline region. However, voltage loss analysis indicates the morphological difference in these thin films. One possible speculation is that P1/P2 exhibits a different morphology in the amorphous region, since in our previous work we found that in JP02 the conjugated backbones and NDI side units showed good miscibility. It is possible that the introduction of triazole would lower the miscibility, resulting in a poor performance. This requires more studies in the future.
3. Conclusion
In this work, we have developed two double-cable conjugated polymers (P1 and P2) with triazole based semiflexible linkers to connect the donor backbones and NDI side units. The polymers have similar absorption spectra to that of JP02, while the energy levels are upshifted compared with that of JP02. The two polymers were then applied into SCOSCs, exhibiting PCEs much lower than that based on JP02. Further studies revealed that the low PCEs might be due to the low charge carrier mobilities deriving from the enlarged π–π stacking distance. Further improvements, including new linkers, such as phenyl and thienyl units, and the optimization of nanophase separation in these polymers are in progress in our lab.

Synthesis of monomer M2 (7,7′-(((((2,6-dibromobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(dodecane-12,1-diyl))bis(1H-1,2,3-triazole-1,4-diyl))bis(methylene))bis(2-(2-butyloctyl)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone)). 
Compound 6 (100 mg, 0.11 mmol), compound 2 (112 mg, 0.24 mmol) and CuI (2 mg) were dissolved in 25 mL of toluene under a N2 atmosphere in dark conditions. Then a solution of N,N,N′,N′′,N′′-pentamethyl diethylenetriamine (PMDETA) in toluene (5 mL) was added. The mixture was stirred for 12 h. Then the mixture was poured into water and extracted by dichloromethane (150 mL). Then the organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After removing the solvent, the crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography (dichloromethane:ethyl acetate, v/v = 10:1 as eluent) to obtain monomer M2 (138 mg, yield 68%). 1H NMR (CD2Cl2, 400 MHz): δ (ppm) 8.73–8.78 (q, 4H), 7.65 (s, 2H), 7.55 (s, 2H), 7.20 (d, 2H), 6.88 (d, 2H), 5.52 (s, 4H), 4.28 (t, 4H), 4.11 (d, 4H), 2.88 (t, 4H), 1.80–2.03 (m, 6H), 1.25–1.78 (m, 68H), 0.86–0.88 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) 163.10, 162.59, 147.80, 142.64, 140.16, 135.89, 135.67, 131.24, 130.97, 128.00, 126.79, 126.72, 126.38, 126.06, 124.55, 123.26, 116.76, 50.49, 44.97, 36.59, 35.53, 31.82, 31.65, 31.58, 31.32, 30.25, 29.68, 29.55, 29.50, 29.47, 29.34, 29.20, 28.97, 28.62, 26.48, 26.40.

Synthesis of P1. 
To a degassed mixture of monomers M1 (45.05 mg, 26.38 μmol) and M3 (26.47 mg, 26.38 μmol) in toluene (2.5 mL) and DMF (0.25 mL), Pd(PPh3)4 (1 mg, 0.87 μmol) was added. The mixture was stirred at 115 °C for 48 h in a nitrogen atmosphere, after which it was precipitated in methanol and filtered through a Soxhlet thimble. The polymer was extracted with acetone, hexane and dichloromethane. Then the polymer was dissolved in chlorobenzene and filtered, the solvent was evaporated and the polymer was precipitated in acetone. The polymer was collected by filtering over a 0.45 μm PTFE membrane filter and dried in a vacuum oven to yield P1 (40 mg, 67.8%) as a dark blue solid. GPC (TCB, 150 °C): Mn = 157.5 kDa, Mw = 358.8 kDa and PDI = 2.28.


Synthesis of P2. 
To a degassed mixture of monomers M2 (47.85 mg, 25.50 μmol) and M3 (25.59 mg, 25.50 μmol) in toluene (2.5 mL) and DMF (0.25 mL), Pd(PPh3)4 (1 mg, 0.87 μmol) was added. The mixture was stirred at 115 °C for 48 h in a nitrogen atmosphere, after which it was precipitated in methanol and filtered through a Soxhlet thimble. The polymer was extracted with acetone, hexanes, and chloroform. The polymer was recovered from the chloroform fraction and was collected by filtering over a 0.45 μm PTFE membrane filter and dried in a vacuum oven to yield P2 (51 mg, 83.6%) as a dark blue solid. GPC (TCB, 150 °C): Mn = 78.6 kDa, Mw = 314.3 kDa and PDI = 4.00.
