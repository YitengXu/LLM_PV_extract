    , Accepted 10th June 2019First published on 11th June 2019AbstractWe report a highly efficient and cost-effective binder-free catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using V2O5 particles on nickel foam (NF) (V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF). This low-cost catalyst exhibits Pt-like activity with a low overpotential of 39 mV at 10 mA cm−2 (lowest among V-based materials which are known to be generally non-explosive and safe) and long-term stability in a 1 M KOH solution. The overall performance is highly comparable to that of a commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst on NF. Furthermore, the V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF outperforms the Pt/C catalyst at a higher current density (100 mA cm−2) which is more preferable for industrial applications. First principles calculations show that the remarkable HER activity is ascribed to the near-zero adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) on the Ni-site of Ni(OH)2@NF and the Ni- and O-sites of in situ generated V2O5@NF, due to the charge transfer arising from adsorbed O atoms on Ni(111), along with high conductivity of NF. O-adsorption on the Ni transition metal surface downshifts the d-band center of the transition metal, which helps in quick hydrogen desorption by weakening the hydrogen binding strength. As a result, most Ni fcc sites of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF are more active than pristine Ni fcc sites. The V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF catalyst initiates overall water splitting at 1.53 V in a 6 M KOH solution for solar-to-hydrogen generation in a two-electrode set-up using a solar panel.
1. Introduction
Clean and sustainable hydrogen production is an essential priority for a future hydrogen-based economy. Among various alternative energy technologies, water splitting is a promising pathway to provide hydrogen. Thus, developing highly efficient water splitting catalysts is crucial for renewable energy production and industrialization.1–5 It is noteworthy that noble metals such as platinum (Pt) are the most active catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their near-zero ΔGH*.6–8 However, Pt based catalysts are costly, and the limited resources of Pt in the earth hinder its industrial application in water splitting in large-scale hydrogen production. In recent years, tremendous efforts have been made to develop low cost and earth abundant electrocatalysts.9–14 Recently, Shi et al. reported V-based dichalcogenides as an efficient water splitting catalyst.15 They grew VS2 nanosheets on carbon paper as a highly active HER catalyst in acidic media and also synthesized lepidocrocite VOOH hollow nanospheres as an efficient overall water splitting catalyst under basic conditions.16 Other studies of V-based materials (V-doped Ni3S2 NWs and V2Se9@PEDOT NSs/NF) showed that the V metal is a promising 3d transition metal for water splitting electrochemistry.17–23 The most prominent advantages of V-based catalysts are their low cost, abundance, high electrochemical performance, unlimited energy capacity, and inherently safe and non-explosive characteristics. Despite substantial efforts made for the synthesis of V-based HER catalysts, enhancement of catalytic activity is a challenging task which depends on foreign active components (mainly S, Se, Co, etc.). Given that the development of a highly efficient HER catalytic system based on vanadium is highly demanding, we demonstrate here the synthesis of a novel vanadium based HER catalyst (V2O5 particles directly grown on NF) via a simple one step hydrothermal method. The as prepared Pt-like binder free V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF catalyst shows superior performance for the HER and water splitting. This work not only presents V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF as a cheap and highly active binder-free electrocatalyst with excellent activity and stability toward the HER but also provides an effective strategy to use earth-abundant vanadium as electrocatalysts for water splitting. Furthermore, the catalyst achieves solar-to-hydrogen generation at an onset potential of 1.53 V in a two-electrode water splitting set-up.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals
All chemicals were purchased from commercial sources (analytical or reagent grade). Ammonium metavanadate (99%), potassium hydroxide (90%), urea (98%), sodium hydroxide (98%), and ammonium persulfate (98%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Commercial 20 wt% Pt/C was obtained from Johnson Matthey. Nickel foam (99.99%) was purchased from MTI Corporation. All aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized water (DI).
2.2 Synthesis of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF
The V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF was grown on NF through a one-step hydrothermal reaction. First, the commercial nickel foam (1 × 3 cm2) was cleaned with a concentrated HCl solution in an ultrasound bath for 5 min and then washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol for 10 min each to remove the surface impurities of Ni foam. Second, 174 mg of ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3), 1 g sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 1.5 g of urea (CH4N2O) were dissolved in 15 mL of distilled water and ultra-sonicated for 5 min. Then, 1.14 g of ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8) with nickel foam was added to the above solution, which was stirred at room temperature overnight. Third, the as-prepared solution with Ni foam was transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, which was sealed, maintained at 150 °C for 24 h, and then allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The as-prepared V2O5 particles directly grown on NF (V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF) were washed with distilled water and ethanol several times and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 8 h.
2.3 Synthesis of Ni(OH)2@NF
The synthesis procedure of the Ni(OH)2@NF catalyst is similar to that of the V2O5Ni(OH)2@NF catalyst. In this procedure without adding ammonium metavanadate in the reaction, first 1 g sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 1.5 g of urea (CH4N2O) were dissolved in 15 mL of distilled water and ultra-sonicated for 5 min. Then, 1.14 g of ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8) with washed NF was added to the above solution, which was stirred at room temperature overnight. Finally, the as-prepared solution with Ni foam was transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, which was sealed, maintained at 150 °C for 6 h, and then allowed to cool to room temperature naturally to obtain Ni(OH)2@NF.
2.4 Structure characterization
The chemical composition of the catalyst was investigated by using energy-X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS (K-alpha, Thermosphere). The surface morphologies of catalysts were analyzed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy HRTEM (JEM-2100F, JEOL) and cold field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). HRTEM was performed with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV, and STEM-EDS images were obtained on a JEM-2100F with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The HRTEM samples were prepared by scraping off the V2O5/Ni(OH)2 from the prepared nickel foam with a sharp blade, and then the particles were ultrasonically dispersed for 60 min in ethanol. ICP-MS (Perkin Elmer, ELAN DRC-II) and EA (Flash 2000, Thermo Fisher) were used to determine the weight percentages of elements in the catalyst. Raman measurement was performed using a Senterra Raman Scope system with 532 nm wavelength incident laser light and 20 mW power. XRD measurements were performed on a D8 Advance (Bruker).
2.5 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical properties were analyzed on a VSP instrument (Bio Logic Science Instruments, Inc.) in a three-electrode system at room temperature in 1 M KOH. The catalyst grown on NF was used as the working electrode, a graphitic rod was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode. All the SCE potentials were converted to values with reference to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the following equation:E(RHE) = E(SCE) + 1.0518
All the working electrodes were first activated by cycling the potential at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 for at least 10 cycles. Linear sweep voltammetry data were obtained in H2 saturated environment at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH. The electrochemical stability of the catalyst was evaluated by continuously cycling the catalyst 10000 times at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was determined by performing cyclic voltammetry under different scan rates ranging from 20 to 180 mV s−1. When 20% Pt/C was utilized as the catalyst, its loading amount was 0.5 mg cm−2 on Ni foam. Commercially available V2O5 is also loaded on NF for control group study (loading 1 mg cm−2). All data presented were corrected with Rs.
2.6 Computational details
The designed structure shown in Fig. 6a contained 295 atoms and was optimized with spin-polarized DFT using the Vienna ab initio program package.24,25 The projector augmented wave (PAW) method was used to describe the interaction between electrons and ions.26,27 The exchange-correlation potential was corrected by the PBE method.28 3 × 3 and 5 × 5 k-grids were used to optimize the structure and obtain the electronic structure, respectively, with a 500 eV cut-off energy. Self-consistent field calculations were used to optimize electronic and ionic steps until the energy difference between two successive steps became 0.01 meV and the force constant on each ion reached 0.01 eV Å−1. For all distinguishable atomic sites, the H adsorption energy (Eads) was calculated using Eads = Esur+H − Esur − 0.5 × EH2, where Esur+H, Esur, and EH2 are energies of the hydrogenated surface slab, pure surface slab, and hydrogen molecule, respectively. Then, the H adsorption free energy was calculated using ΔGH* = Esur+H − Esur − 0.5 × EH2 + ΔZPE − TΔS, where Esur+H, Esur, EH2, ΔZPE, T, and ΔS are the energies of the hydrogenated surface slab, pure surface slab, and hydrogen molecule, change in zero point energy, absolute temperature, and entropy change of hydrogen adsorption at 300 K, respectively. For Ni based materials, our calculation shows that ΔGH* = Esur+H − Esur − 0.5 × EH2 + 0.24 eV. The Hubbard-U correction (DFT+U) was also applied for the Ni (U = 6.3 eV) atom of NiO and V (U = 3.0 eV) atom of V2O5 , but this correction changes ΔGH* (by ∼9 meV), which is not significant.29,30
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF
V2O5 particles were uniformly grown on NF by a single step hydrothermal method. Calculated amounts of ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8), and urea (CH4N2O) were suspended in a mixed oxidative and alkaline solution, and the reaction process was carried out at 150 °C for 24 h. Fig. 1 schematically shows the preparation process of the binder-free optimal V2O5 particles directly grown on NF (V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF). The morphology of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) shows that the surface of NF looks like a uniform forest with 190–200 nm thickness (Fig. 2a) which was uniformly covered by V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF particles (Fig. S1a–c, ESI†). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis further confirms that each chemical element (Ni, V and O) was uniformly distributed on NF (Fig. S1d–g†). The structure analysis of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF was performed with high resolution transmission electron microscopy (Fig. S2a and b†). Fig. 2b shows the lattice spacings of ∼0.261, ∼0.218 and 0.248 nm, matching with the {310}, {002}, and {211} planes of V2O5 particles (Fig. S2c†), respectively.31–35 The other lattice spacing of ∼0.148 nm in the selected region matches well with that of Ni(OH)2.36 The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis further confirms that the catalyst is composed of homogeneously distributed Ni, V and O species (Fig. 2c–f). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses are performed, but it is hard to see the XRD characteristic peaks of V2O5 because the intrinsic peak of V2O5 is very weak on NF (Fig. S2d†).

We further verified the composition of the Pt-like V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF catalyst using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Raman spectroscopy confirms the presence of vanadium and Ni(OH)2 on NF. The observed Raman band in the frequency region 792 cm−1 corresponds to the V–O stretching mode (850–750 cm−1), while the band at 540 cm−1 corresponds to the vibration of the Ni–O stretching mode (Fig. 3a).37,38 In contrast, no peaks were detected in the Raman spectrum of pure NF. XPS analysis was performed to confirm the chemical state and the elemental composition of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF (Fig. S3†). The atomic percentages of these elements are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). Fig. 3b–d show the spectra of Ni 2p and O 1s/V 2p, and the enlarged spectrum of V 2p of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF, respectively. In the Ni 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 3b), peaks with binding energies at 855.3 and 873.0 eV were attributed to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, with a spin-energy separation of 17.7 eV, which is a characteristic signature of Ni2+ of Ni(OH)2.39,40 Two shake-up satellite peaks of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 were located at around at 861.4 eV and 879.4 eV, respectively. The core level XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 3c) contains three main peaks. Among these, two peaks located at 529.72 eV and 531.12 eV, respectively, are attributed to O2− in V–O and Ni(OH)2 of the V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF catalyst, while the remaining one peak at 531.96 eV is attributed to –OH on NF. The enlarged spectrum of the V 2p core level (Fig. 3d), mainly due to the spin–orbit coupling, is further decomposed into V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 (516.89 and 523.91 eV, respectively), separated by ∼7.02 eV, which corresponds to the spectrum of V2O5. A closer view of the O 1s and V 2p region gives the actual difference in binding energy of 12.83 eV between V 2p3/2 (516.89) and O 1s (529.72), in good agreement with that of V5+ reported previously.41–45

3.2 Electrochemical performance
The electrocatalytic activity of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF was evaluated in a 1 M KOH solution using a standard three-electrode configuration. The corresponding polarization curves for V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF are given with IR compensation (Fig. 4). All potentials in this work are referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). It shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF for the HER, which is equivalent to the catalytic efficiency of commercial 20% Pt/C on NF (Fig. 4a). The synthesized V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF shows an outstanding overpotential of 39 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is comparable to that of 20% Pt/C (overpotential: 35 mV at 10 mA cm−2). To the best of our knowledge, this overpotential is superior to that in most of the previous studies reported on Pt-free electrocatalysts for the HER, which are summarized in ESI Table S2.† To evaluate the impact of V2O5 on catalytic activity, we synthesized a sample Ni(OH)2@NF without a vanadium source. Despite having a relatively higher catalytic activity than bare NF, it requires an overpotential of 188 mV at 10 mA cm−2, which is inferior to the overpotential 39 mV of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF. This indicates the key role of V2O5 in the hybrid material for the HER. Additionally, we also compared the HER activity of V2O5 on NF (V2O5@NF), which shows an overpotential of 207 mV at 10 mA cm−2, which is also inferior to that of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF. These results suggest that the high activity of the catalyst can be facilitated by a synergistic effect of in situ developed V2O5@NF and Ni(OH)2@NF. This synergistic effect will be later discussed using our DFT calculations which show that their interfaces promote the release of evolved hydrogen gas bubbles from the catalyst surface, and so enable an improved HER performance. Fig. 4b displays the Tafel plots of the polarization curves which are related to the reaction process of a catalyst. The Tafel slope of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF was 44 mV dec−1 (as compared with 35 mV dec−1 for 20% Pt/C@NF). This Tafel slope suggests that V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF undergoes a combined Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism.10

(b) Polarization curve derived Tafel plots of 20% Pt/C@NF and V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF. (c) Long-term stability test carried out at a constant potential of 39 mV (vs. RHE).

(d) Estimation of Cdl by plotting the current density variation [Δj = (janode − jcathode)/2] at 0.3 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. Inset: voltammograms of the electrode V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF at various scan rates. 
The long-term durability of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF was evaluated by chronoamperometry at a constant potential of 39 mV in 1 M KOH (Fig. 4c). This catalyst displayed an extended period of stability for >24 h with a nearly stable current density. To further evaluate the long-term durability of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted 10000 times (inset in Fig. 4c). After the repeated potential sweeps, the polarization curves before and after 10000 cycles of electrolysis showed a negligible loss in the catalytic activity. Post-characterization of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF further supported the excellent stability of the catalyst. The morphology of the synthesized catalyst was well maintained after chronoamperometry and cyclic stability testing (Fig. S4†). The XPS and TEM data also confirmed that V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF possesses excellent stability for the HER at room temperature (Fig. S4†), indicating that its bulk composition was maintained. The electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) was used to evaluate the electrochemically active surface area of the V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF catalyst (Fig. 4d).46 The Cdl value of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF is 15.2 mF cm−2. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF was also measured using a three-electrode system in 1 M KOH. LSV curves (Fig. S5†) indicated that V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF exhibited high OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 360 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec−1.
3.3 Direct use of solar energy for overall water splitting
Inspired by the excellent HER and OER catalytic activities of the V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF, we assembled a two-electrode system using the V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF as both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting under highly corrosive conditions (Fig. 5). The bare-NF‖bare-NF was also tested for comparison. All these studies were performed in a commercially used electrolyte of a 30% KOH solution (6 M). Fig. 5a shows that the polarization curves of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF require a very small cell voltage of only 1.53 V to initiate water splitting and an applied cell voltage of 1.59 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2. This cell voltage value is quite low as compared to that for NF and any previously reported bifunctional catalysts.16,47–53 In addition, the V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF also shows long-term stability for full water splitting over 24 h testing (Fig. 5b).

(b) Long-term stability test carried out at a constant potential of 1.59 V in 6 M KOH. Inset: the image of production of H2 and O2 in the water splitting device by applying a minimum cell voltage of 1.53 V. 
Electricity sources are required to produce hydrogen fuel by water splitting reactions. Among all the different sources of electricity, solar energy is the most potent and eco-friendly source of electricity. The direct use of solar energy in overall water splitting is a promising means of energy conversion and storage.54,55 We also found that water splitting was achieved using electricity directly obtained from solar energy. As shown in Fig. S6,† we connected a full water splitting set-up directly to a solar panel through a crocodile clip. Here, we used a commercially available solar cell panel (2 V/180 mA per panel), which supplied sufficient voltage for continuous operation of the full water splitting set-up. We also used a digital multimeter to monitor (and optimize) the applied voltage and a xenon lamp (300 W) as the light source. Finally, we applied a stable potential of 1.53 V to the full water splitting set-up connected to the solar panel (the digital multimeter continuously monitors the applied potential). We observed the continuous splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen gas on the cathode and anode, respectively. This small demo of solar to hydrogen production shows that the V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF catalyst can be exploited for large scale industrial application.
3.4 Theoretical calculations
Using density functional theory (DFT), we studied the active sites of the V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF catalyst. To this end, we also investigated individual materials of V2O5, Ni(OH)2, Ni(OH)2–&#00BC;Hdes (denoted as [Ni(OH)2]n–Ni(OH)(OH0.75) in order to represent the surface state where ¼ monolayer (ML) of H atoms is desorbed from the surface), Ni(OH)2–½Hdes (denoted as [Ni(OH)2]n–Ni(OH)(OH0.5) to represent the surface state where ½ML–H of H atoms is desorbed from the surface), NiO, and Ni(111) (Fig. S7–S13†). For V2O5, the H adsorption energy was calculated on the most stable V2O5(010) surface and less stable V2O5(001) and V2O5(310) surfaces which were analyzed by TEM (Fig. 2b). In the structural optimization, V2O5 and Ni(OH)2 on the Ni(111) surface form V2O5/Ni(OH)2@Ni (Fig. 6a). The calculated H-adsorption energies (Eads) for Ni(OH)2, Ni(OH)(OH0.75), Ni(OH)(OH0.5), V2O5(010), NiO, and the pristine Ni-surface are 0.843, −0.20, −0.83, −0.38, −0.72, and −0.54 eV, respectively. Since H is adsorbed on V2O5(001) and (310) surfaces very strongly (Eads < −0.8 eV, Fig. S7 and S8†), V2O5(010) is considered to be an active surface of V2O5. The Eads values of Ni(OH)2, NiO, and the pristine Ni-surface are in close agreement with previous reports.56,57 These results reveal that full 1 ML H-covered Ni(OH)2 has a highly H-desorptive nature since O atoms are fully covered with H, whereas ½ML H-covered [Ni(OH)2]n–Ni(OH)(OH0.5) and pristine-Ni have a highly H-adsorptive nature. As for the ¾ML H-covered [Ni(OH)2]n–Ni(OH)(OH0.75) surface, the ΔGH* is close to zero (0.04 eV). However, Ni(OH)2 is an insulating material with a large band gap (Fig. S13†) and so it cannot exhibit good HER activity.58

(a) Top view of the ball and stick model of the optimized Ni(111) surface with V2O5 and Ni(OH)2 deposition [Numbers 1–7 indicate H adsorption sites. 1: the reconstructed Ni-surface, 2: the Ni-site of Ni(OH)2@Ni, 3: the Ni-site between V2O5@Ni and Ni(OH)2@Ni, 4: the Ni-site of V2O5@Ni, 5: the O-site on the V2O5 surface, 6: the O-site inside the V2O5 channel, and 7: the Ni-site on Ni(OH)2 (not shown)]. The supercell boundary is indicated by a black dashed line. (b) Side view of the optimized structure along the [100] direction. (c) Calculated free energies at sites 1 to 6 (7 which has a high value > 1 eV is not shown). (d) Calculated free energies for various individual pristine materials. 
The optimized structure of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@Ni shows that the top Ni(111)-layer undergoes lattice distortion (Fig. 6b) during formation of the interface, whereas the bottom Ni-layer retains its original lattice. Therefore, Ni–Ni bond lengths become somewhat different on the top layer with respect to the pristine case (Fig. S11†). Due to the surface modification, diverse H-adsorption sites are on the top layer of Ni(111) as in Fig. 6a. The calculated Eads for all distinguished atomic sites from 1 to 7 in Fig. 6a are −0.45, −0.39, −0.51, −0.29, −0.33, −0.03, and 1.06 eV, respectively. Then, after adding the correction term, the calculated ΔGH* for all the above configurations are plotted in Fig. 6c and d. The ΔGH* of the Ni-sites at the edges of interfaces in Ni(OH)2@Ni and V2O5@Ni and the O-site of V2O5 (corresponding to 2, 4, and 5, respectively) are close to zero (−0.10, −0.05, and −0.09 eV, respectively), comparable to the ΔGH* on the Pt(111)-surface (−0.09 eV). The edges of the interfaces in V2O5/Ni(OH)2@Ni play a significant role in hydrogen production.
To study the effects of Ni(OH)2 and V2O5, we compare the Bader charges (q) of sites 2 and 4. The edge Ni atoms of Ni(OH)2@Ni, V2O5@Ni, and V2O5/Ni (OH)2@Ni lose their electrons near Ni(OH)2 and V2O5 (Ni-site 2 of Ni(OH)2@Ni: qNi = 0.19, Ni-site 4 of V2O5@Ni: qNi = 0.05), while the top surface of Ni(111) is slightly negatively charged (qNi = −0.03). Thus, the synergistic effect is attributed to the charge transfer arising from adsorbed O atoms on Ni(111). O-adsorption on the Ni transition metal surface downshifts the d-band center of the transition metal. The d-band center relative to the Fermi level (εd − εF) of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@Ni is at −1.35 eV which is lower than those of V2O5@Ni (−1.31 eV) and pristine Ni (−1.23 eV) (Fig. S14†). Then, the energy levels of antibonding orbitals of the Ni transition metal become lower, and so the contribution of the antibonding orbitals from the Ni transition metal increases its binding with adsorbed hydrogen. This weakens the strong hydrogen adsorption strength to the Ni surface and hence helps in easy hydrogen adsorption/desorption.59,60 This results in near-zero ΔGH* values on the Ni-site of Ni(OH)2@NF and the Ni- and O-sites of V2O5@NF, which brings about the remarkable HER activity. Therefore, the remarkable activity on the Ni-sites is attributed to the charge transfer arising from adsorbed O atoms on Ni(111) along with high conductivity of NF. O-adsorption on the Ni transition metal surface downshifts the d-band center of the transition metal, which helps in quick hydrogen desorption by weakening hydrogen binding strength. As a result, most Ni fcc sites of V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF are more active than pristine Ni fcc sites.
4. Conclusion
We developed a simple and cost-efficient strategy for one step hydrothermal synthesis of a highly active and stable binder-free HER catalyst by growing V2O5 particles directly on 3D porous nickel foam (V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF). The synthesized Pt-like V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF acts as a remarkable HER electrocatalyst in a 1 M KOH solution with a very low overpotential of 39 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The results of DFT calculations reveal that Ni-sites at edges of interfaces in V2O5/Ni(OH)2@NF are highly active. Efficient full water splitting is achieved at a potential of 1.53 V in a 6 M KOH solution and requires a cell voltage of 1.59 V to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2, at which good stability is achieved. We also showed solar to hydrogen generation through overall water splitting by connecting the water splitting cell to a solar panel directly. The bulk scale synthesis methodology and remarkable catalytic activity toward alkaline HER and full water splitting support utilization of the catalyst in industrial applications.
