    , Accepted 13th November 2015First published on 16th November 2015AbstractWe have significantly improved the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by incorporating plasmonic Au nanostars into the TiO2 photoanode. Gold nanostars were synthesized and used as localized surface plasmons (LSPs) to enhance the light absorption of DSSCs. The Au nanostars exhibit near infrared (NIR) light absorption at ∼785 nm. The N719 and N749 dye based DSSC devices were fabricated with and without the incorporation of Au nanostars. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs using Au nanostars was increased by ∼20% from 7.1% to 8.4% for N719 cells and by ∼30% from 3.9% to 5.0% for N749 devices. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was improved and the spectral response was broadened over the wavelength range of 380–1000 nm. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed that by incorporating Au nanostars, the charge recombination resistance Rct value decreased under both open-circuit and illumination conditions, which indicated high electron density generated in the device photoanode.
Introduction
Over the last few decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant interest as a potential low-cost, clean, and renewable energy source.1–7 Under illumination, dyes act as light absorbers,8–11 in which photons excite electrons from the ground to the excited states. Electrons are then injected into TiO2, diffuse through the mesoporous TiO2 to the electrode and reach the counter-electrode through an external circuit. The oxidized dye molecules are reduced by the redox electrolyte I−/I3− and the oxidized redox is subsequently reduced by the electrons from the counter-electrode.12
One of the most effective ways to improve the device efficiency is to enhance the light-harvesting capacity of absorbers over a broader range of wavelengths. To achieve higher and broader spectrum light absorption, many efforts, such as introducing new dye sensitizers and co-sensitizers,13–16 have been made. A promising approach to enhance light-harvesting capacity is the introduction of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) from metallic nanoparticles.17–23 Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) occurs when the incident light excites the coherent oscillation of free electrons in metal nanoparticles (NPs). Various metallic nanostructures have been used to improve the performance of DSCs. Silver (Ag) NPs,17–23 gold (Au) NPs24–28 and aluminium (Al) NPs29–32 were used to intensify the electromagnetic field near metallic NPs and enhance light absorption. The results showed that metallic nanostructures can be used as light absorption boosters of dye molecules at various wavelength windows depending on the size and shape of plasmonic nanoparticles.20,33–35
So far, there have been few reports using metallic nanostars as plasmonic nanostructures for DSSCs. In this work, Au nanostars having an anisotropic morphology were used to boost light absorption and photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. These plasmonic Au nanostars exhibit strong and broad LSPR from 550 nm to 1000 nm, involving a transverse mode around 550 nm and a longitudinal mode around 785 nm. The average core size of the synthesized Au nanostars was 60–70 nm. The overall efficiency of DSSCs was significantly improved by 20–30% via the incorporation of Au nanostars.
Experimental procedures
Materials
Chloroauric acid (HAuCl4), trisodium citrate, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, molecular weight: 10000) N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), TiCl4 liquid (≥99.0%) and titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in 2-propanol) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Fluorine doped tin dioxide (FTO) substrates were ordered from Hartford Glass. Nanocrystalline TiO2 (Ti-nanoxide HT/SP), scattering TiO2 (Ti-nanoxide R/SP), N719 dye (Ruthenizer 535-bisTBA) and N749 dye (Ruthenizer 620-1H3TBA) were obtained from Solaronix. All materials were used as received except that TiCl4 was diluted in deionized water (DI) to prepare a 40 mM aqueous solution and titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in 2-propanol) was diluted in ethanol to prepare 0.2 M solution for TiO2 compact layer deposition.
Synthesis of Au nanostars

Synthesis of Au seeds. 
Au NP seeds of 20 nm in diameter were prepared by standard citrate reduction.18 Typically, 125 mL of 0.88 mM HAuCl4 aqueous solution was heated under continuous stirring until it got boiled. Then, 13.25 mL of 1 wt% sodium citrate aqueous solution was added into the boiling solution and subsequently the solution mixture was allowed to react for 15 min. The resulting Au NP solution was cooled down, followed by the addition of 3.2 g of PVP in order to coat Au NPs with PVP as a stabilizer. The solution mixture was kept at room temperature overnight under constant stirring. The final solution was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 20 min and the PVP-coated Au NPs were collected and re-dispersed in ethanol.


Growth of Au nanostars. 
The synthesis of Au nanostars was modified from our previously reported method.19 The solution of PVP (10 mM) in 30 mL DMF was mixed with 100 μL of HAuCl4 aqueous solution (104 mM) under stirring. Following this, 100 μL of a concentrated PVP-coated Au seed solution was added into the solution. After that, the reaction was allowed to proceed for 3 h at room temperature under constant stirring. The solution mixture underwent a color transition from pink to deep blue. Finally, the reaction solution was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 20 min and Au nanostars were collected and re-dispersed in DI water.

Preparation of the TiO2 photoanode and device assembly
FTO substrates were first cleaned by ultrasonication in DI water, acetone and 2-propanol (IPA), 15 minutes each. After that, FTO substrates were immersed in 40 mM of TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min, followed by cleaning using DI water and ethanol, and then dried under nitrogen and annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. A compact layer of TiO2 was spin coated using 0.2 M of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), 75 wt% in ethanol solution onto the treated FTO, and then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. A transparent nanocrystalline TiO2 layer of 12 μm thick (Solaronix Ti-nanoxide HT/SP) was obtained by the doctor blading technique followed by annealing at 450 °C for 30 min. For plasmonic cells, the photoanode was soaked in Au nanostar solution in IPA for 6 hours. The color of the photoanode changed from transparent to transparent bluish after Au nanostars were attached to TiO2. Another thin layer of TiO2 was coated onto Au nanostars to obtain a core–shell Au–TiO2 structure by immersing the mesoporous TiO2/Au nanostar photoanode in TiO2 colloid solution for 30 min and then annealed at 450 °C. The TiO2 colloid was prepared by diluting 1 g of Solaronix Ti-nanoxide HT/SP in 5 mL of ethanol and stirring the solution for 30 min at room temperature. This step was performed to prevent the direct contact of Au nanostars with the dye since Au nanostars could act as charge carrier recombination centers. This process was repeated three times for better plasmonic performance of Au nanostars. A scattering layer of TiO2 (Solaronix Ti-nanoxide R/SP) with a thickness of 4 μm was deposited on the nanocrystalline TiO2. Again, the photoanode was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. The photoanode was then traded using 40 mM solution of TiCl4 in DI water at 70 °C for 30 min. This was followed by annealing at 450 °C for 30 min. Finally, the photoanode was cooled down to 80 °C just before immersing in 0.3 mM of both N719 and N749 dye solutions in acetonitrile/t-butanol (volume ratio: 1/1) for 24 hours at room temperature. The final photoanode was rinsed in acetonitrile to remove any excess dye molecules. For comparison, reference cells without Au nanostars were fabricated following the same fabrication procedures but without soaking in Au nanostar solution.
The photoanode and counter electrode were then assembled together using a thermoplastic sealant. The iodide/triiodide (I3−/3I−) electrolyte was then injected into the cells and sealed to prevent any leakage.
Characterization
UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of Au seed and Au nanostar solutions were taken by a using Varian Cary 5000 spectrometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of NPs were acquired by using a JEOL 2100F microscope. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was performed using a Hitachi-S-4300N scanning electron microscope.
DSSCs were tested under AM 1.5 illumination at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 to measure current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics. A xenon 40 lamp (Newport 67005) with an AM 1.5 filter was used as the light source during measurements. For measuring the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), the xenon lamp was connected to a Newport monochromator. Two lenses were used to focus monochromatic light onto the active area of the DSSCs. The light output was modulated from 350 nm to 1000 nm and the IPCE data were calibrated with a NREL calibrated reference cell.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed under illumination at 0.77 V (∼Voc) using an Ametek VERSASTAT3-200 potentiostat with a frequency analysis module. The amplitude of the AC signal was set at 10 mV in the frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the low- and high-magnification TEM images of Au nanostars. The low magnification TEM image (Fig. 1a) shows that Au nanostars have high morphology uniformity and basically no other morphologies such as spheres were observed. The high magnification TEM image (Fig. 1b) clearly exhibits the presence of multiple well-defined pods/tips on the surface. The average diameter of Au nanostars is about 80 nm. Fig. 1c–f show the cross-sectional SEM image and EDX mapping images of O, Ti and Au of about 12 μm thick mesoporous TiO2/Au nanostar film, respectively. The EDX mapping image (Fig. 1f) of the Au element showed that ∼1 wt% concentration of Au nanostars was uniformly embedded in the TiO2 photoanode.

Fig. 2a shows the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of PVP-coated Au seeds and Au nanostars dispersed in DI water. The peak of the LSPR band of PVP-coated Au seeds is located at 520 nm. The Au nanostars grown from the Au seeds exhibited a well-defined double LSPR pattern, which is consistent with the formation of an anisotropic/elongated morphology. The appearance of the strong resonance band of Au nanostars centered at a longer wavelength of ∼785 nm is associated with the formation of tips, whereas the shoulder at ∼550 nm is ascribed to the transverse plasmon mode of cores, the same as the case of Au seeds.36,37 Such Au nanostars are expected to have strong local electromagnetic field enhancement38 around the tips and also a significant light scattering effect. This may lead to an increase in light absorption of adjacent dye molecules, and thus improvement in device efficiency. Fig. 2b shows UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the solution mixtures of Au nanostars with N719 or N749 dyes while Fig. 2c shows UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the TiO2 film attached with Au nanostars and dyes. It was observed from Fig. 2b that N719 dye exhibited two peaks at ∼386 and ∼530 nm while the absorption peaks of N749 were located at ∼415 and ∼615 nm. After mixing with Au nanostars, the absorption spectra of both dyes were overlapped to get broader absorption spectra and showed a new broad peak at ∼785 nm which represents the absorption peak of Au nanostars. N719 exhibited higher absorption than N749. Also, it is noticed that absorption enhancement of the N749 dye/Au nanostar mixture was higher than that of the N719 dye/Au nanostar mixture. This could be due to the fact that the absorption overlapping between N749 dye and Au nanostars is much higher than that between N719 dye and Au nanostars. Fig. 2c shows that the incorporation of Au nanostars into the photoanode induced higher and broader optical absorption for both N719 and N749 dye molecules.

Fig. 3 shows the J–V curves of DSSCs with and without embedded Au nanostars for both N719 and N749 dyes measured under AM 1.5 illumination at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The device performance parameters were calculated and are summarized in Table 1. The overall efficiencies of DSSCs were significantly increased by embedding Au nanostars into the photoanode. For the N719 based cells, the device efficiency increased from 7.1% to 8.4% showing ∼20% enhancement, and the enhancement was even much higher (∼30%) in the case of N749 dye based cells, increasing from 3.9% to 5.0%. The overall performance of the N719 dye based cells was much higher than that of the N749 device because the N719 absorption is much higher than N749 in the spectral range of 400–630 nm as shown in Fig. 2c. Another reason is that charge transfer at the N749 dye/TiO2 interface is less efficient than that at the N719 dye/TiO2 interface, as reported previously.39 The efficiency improvement by adding Au nanostars results mainly from the increase in the short circuit current (Jsc) of the cell, which was caused by the enhanced light absorption of dyes in the DSSC device due to the plasmonic effects of Au nanostars. In addition, the open circuit voltage (Voc) slightly increased from 0.76 V to 0.79 V for the N719 dye based cells and from 0.72 V to 0.75 V in the case of the N749 dye based cells. This could be attributed to the fact that the Au nanostars can cause a negative shift of the Fermi-level of TiO2, which resulted in a higher photovoltage.26

Fig. 4 shows IPCE action spectra of N719 and N749 based DSSCs with and without Au nanostars, respectively. Similar to the absorption spectra, by embedding Au nanostars into the photoanode of DSSCs, IPCE action spectra of the N719 and N749 dye based cells were improved over a broader spectral range of 350–1000 nm. The significant enhancement in IPCE spectra is most likely due to improved light harvesting caused by the strong surface plasmon effect of incorporated Au nanostars. The Jsc values were estimated from IPCE data using the following equation to validate J–V measurements40  where ηIPCE(λ) and Nph(λ) are the IPCE and photon flux density at wavelength (λ), respectively.
 Fig. 4  IPCE action spectra of N719 and N749 DSSC devices with and without Au nanostars, respectively. 
Using the above equation, the integration of the measured IPCE spectral response with the AM 1.5 solar spectrum results in an estimated Jsc of 14.1 mA cm−2 for N719 DSSCs and 8.13 mA cm−2 for N749 DSSCs without the incorporation of Au nanostars. These calculated Jsc values were very close to the Jsc values (15.1 mA cm−2 for N719 DSSCs and 8.66 mA cm−2 for N749 DSSCs) measured from the J–V curves. Similarly, after incorporating Au nanostars, the estimated Jsc values increased to 16.7 mA cm−2 and 12.0 mA cm−2 for the N719 and N749 DSSCs, respectively, which were once again comparable to the Jsc values (17.2 mA cm−2 for N719 DSSCs and 10.69 mA cm−2 for N749 DSSCs) measured from the J–V curves.
To further analyse the effects of Au nanostars on DSSC performance, EIS was performed at a forward bias under illumination and open circuit conditions for both N719 and N749 dye based cells with and without Au nanostars. Under the open circuit and illumination conditions, the photo-generated electrons are not extracted to the external circuit otherwise balance with the number of I3− ions consumed for the recombination reaction at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. A lower number of photo-generated electrons will recombine with a lower number of I3− ions which results in a higher concentration of I3− ions in the electrolyte that are not consumed in the recombination. On the other hand, by generating more electrons inside the photo-anode, the number of I3− ions consumed in recombination will increase resulting in a lower concentration of I3− ions in the electrolyte. Such a mechanism suggests that the resistance of the recombination reaction or charge transfer resistance Rct will consequently increase by increasing the concentration of I3− ions or decreasing the electron density in the photoanode and decrease by reducing the concentration of I3− ions or increasing the electron density in the photo-anode.41 Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 5a and the equivalent circuit used for data fitting is represented in Fig. 5b. The fitted results are summarized in Table 2.

The intercept of the left semicircle at the highest frequency represents the series resistance Rs of the device. The first semicircle from the left, at higher frequency is attributed to the Pt counter electrode/electrolyte interface and modeled by the parallel connection of the charge transfer resistance Rpt at the Pt/I3− ion interface and double layer capacitance Cpt. The intermediate semicircle is attributed to charge transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, which can be used to model the recombination of the injected electrons in the photoanode with I3− ions in the electrolyte by the parallel combination of charge transfer resistance Rct and the chemical capacitance of the photoanode Cμ. The third semicircle, at lower frequency, is a representation of ion diffusion in the electrolyte. The series resistance Rs value was found to decrease by incorporating Au nanostars for both N719 and N749 DSSCs which could be attributed to the increase of photo-anode conductivity that is consistent with a higher fill factor (FF) from J–V results by adding plasmonic metal Au nanostars. As for the intermediate semicircle, under open-circuit and illumination conditions, it can be seen that the non-plasmonic photoanode (bigger intermediate semicircle) has a higher Rct value which, as mentioned above, indicates lower photo-electron density generated in the device. By incorporating Au nanostars in both N719 and N749 DSSCs, charge transfer resistance Rct gets smaller and this indicates higher photo-electron density generated in the photoanode due to more light absorbed as a result of the plasmonic effect of Au nanostars.41 The chemical capacitance of the photo-anode Cμ value was decreased by adding Au nanostars for both N719 and N749 DSSC devices and this could be due to the decrease of the interfacial surface area between the photo-anode and electrolyte. By incorporating Au nanostars into both N719 and N749 DSSCs, the number of I− ions diffusing from the Pt counter electrode to regenerate ionized dye molecules will increase and this consequently facilitates the reaction between I3− ions and the Pt counter electrode which results in the decrease of charge transfer resistance Rpt at the Pt/I3− ion interface while the capacitance Cpt value did not change significantly for all devices because the same counter electrode Pt was used for all devices.
Conclusions
In summary, the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) was improved by 20–30% via the incorporation of plasmonic Au nanostars into the TiO2 photoanode. Au nanostars with strong and broad LSPs were demonstrated to enhance the light absorption of DSSCs in the NIR region from 500 nm up to 1000 nm. The increase of efficiency is mainly caused by the enhancement in Jsc resulting from the higher light absorption of dyes and thus the generation of more charge carriers in DSSCs. The IPCE spectra confirmed the results of J–V measurements, indicating higher and broader IPCE spectra of plasmonic DSSC devices. EDX images showed that Au nanostars were uniformly incorporated into the TiO2 photoanode. EIS measurements performed under open circuit and illumination conditions further supported that more electrons were generated by incorporating plasmonic Au nanostars.
