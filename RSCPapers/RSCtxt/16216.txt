    , Accepted 29th April 2019First published on 29th April 2019AbstractConstructing twisted molecular structures by linking multiple perylenediimide (PDI) units through a π-bridge has been recognized as an effective way to tune the active layer (phase separation) morphologies for PDI-based organic solar cells. But in the meantime, the introduced electron transfer between intramolecular PDI units will influence the exciton dissociation and electron transport properties of the devices. Herein, we have investigated the impact of π-bridge modes, including different bridge units and linking positions, on the electronic and optical properties of representative dimeric PDI derivatives by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The calculated results point to that the intramolecular electron transfer is mainly controlled by super-exchange mechanism for the PDI–π–PDI dimeric derivatives. The super-exchange coupling is determined by the dihedral angle and energy level alignment between the π-bridge and PDI units as well as the electron density of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) on the linkage site of PDI. Compared with the ortho position, the bay position of PDI possesses higher LUMO density and smaller dihedral angle when linking with the π-bridge, leading to stronger electronic coupling. Moreover, after the π-bridge is changed from benzene to triazine, the resultant smaller energy difference between the LUMOs of π-bridge and PDI will significantly enhance the super-exchange coupling. In addition, time-dependent DFT calculations show that the optical absorption spectra can be greatly modulated by the different π-bridge modes.
Introduction
Perylenediimides (PDI) show great potential as electron acceptors in nonfullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) due to a number of outstanding properties,1–4 such as high chemical, thermal, and light stabilities, strong absorption in the visible region, good electron-accepting abilities, and high electron mobilities.5–10 Moreover, their solubility and optoelectronic as well as self-assembling properties can be fine-tuned by tailoring the substituted groups on the aromatic core and imide positions.11–14 However, owing to the strong aggregation tendency of the highly planar conjugated PDI backbones, it is necessary to reduce π–π stacking to form favorable phase separation when blended with electron donors. One effective method is to construct twisted molecular structures by linking two or more PDI units (at the bay or ortho position) through a conjugated π-bridge.15–22 Because of the steric hindrance between the π-bridge and PDI units, the twisted conformations can effectively suppress the strong self-aggregation and facilitate to form a good nanoscale phase domain, which is beneficial to increase the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).23–27 Unfortunately, the electron mobilities of the twisted PDI derivatives are relatively low, becoming a limitation to achieve a better photovoltaic performance of PDI-based OSCs.18,27–31
Charge transport is an essential electronic process to realize photoelectric conversion in organic photovoltaic devices. The free hole and electron carriers created upon photoexcitation of the active layer materials have to be transported to and then collected by the respective electrodes to generate photocurrent.32–35 In organic semiconductors, the charge transport efficiencies mainly depend on the molecular packing morphologies.32 Specifically for the derivatives containing multiple PDI units, the electron transport abilities, on one hand, depend on the interaction between intermolecular PDI units. On the other hand, the interaction between intramolecular PDI units is also critical to obtain efficient electron transport since it also constitutes the pathways for electron transfer between PDI units.36,37 This has been demonstrated for the PDI dimers linked directly through a single bond in our previous work, which showed that stronger intramolecular electronic interaction would help to improve electron mobility.38 For the compounds with π-bridged multiple PDI units, the PDI units are spatially separated by the central π-bridge so that the direct electronic interaction between them will be very weak; the effective electronic interaction need consider the π-bridge mediated super-exchange mechanism (see Fig. 1a). Super-exchange charge transfer has been widely applied in biosystems,39,40 and successfully extended to organic semiconductors in recent years.41–46

Here, to understand the role of π-bridges, we have theoretically investigated the electronic and optical properties of representative dimeric PDI derivatives with different π-bridge units of para-phenyl (p-Ph), meta-phenyl (m-Ph), and 1,3,5-triazine (m-Ta) linking to the bay or ortho positions of PDI moieties (see Fig. 1b). Our calculations point to that the intramolecular electron transport for the PDI–π–PDI dimers is dominated by the super-exchange mechanism. The electronic couplings strongly depend on the dihedral angles and energy level alignments between the π-bridge and PDI units as well as the charge densities at the linkage atoms. In addition, the optical absorption can be effectively tuned by the different π-bridge modes.
Computational methods
Because of little impact on the electronic and optical properties, the alkyl side chains used in experiments were replaced by the methyl group to simplify calculations. The molecular geometries were optimized by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. Based on the optimized geometries, the excitation energies and oscillator strengths of the singlet excited states and UV-vis absorption spectra in chloroform solution were calculated by time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) at the tuned ωB97XD/6-31G(d,p) level in combination with the PCM model.47,48
As the conjugated π-bridge is introduced between the PDI moieties, the PDI–π–PDI compounds display a twisted structure and the two PDI units are not equivalent. Thus the energy splitting method is not applicable to estimate the super-exchange electronic couplings in these π-bridged PDI derivatives due to the polarization effect.49 Alternatively, the super-exchange coupling can be calculated by the Larsson partition-based method and expressed by the following equation:43 (1)
The implicit term (Vim) is the Hamiltonian matrix element between the two PDI LUMOs obtained by projection of the PDI–π–PDI system Hamiltonian on the orthogonalized fragment basis, which is much weaker than its explicit counterpart. Ṽ1B and ṼB2 denote the couplings of the bridge orbitals with the LUMOs of the two PDI units; E and B correspond to the energies of the adiabatic and bridge levels in the PDI–π–PDI system, respectively. The electronic coupling calculations were performed at the DFT-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. All the DFT and TDDFT calculations were carried out by using the Gaussian 09 E.01 package.50
The thin-film molecular packing morphologies of bb′-(p-Ph)PDI were obtained by atomistic molecular dynamic simulations with the Gromacs-4.6.7 package.51 The direct electronic couplings for the intermolecular neighboring PDI pairs (the shortest inter-atomic distance between the PDI units is less than 0.6 nm) were calculated at the DFT-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. Following our previous work,38,52 the semi-classical Marcus theory was employed to estimate the electron transfer rates between the neighboring PDI units and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate the diffusion coefficients to calculate the electron mobilities of bb′-(p-Ph)PDI.53,54 See the ESI† for more computational details.
Results and discussion
Geometric structures
The optimized molecular geometries are shown in Fig. S1.† All the molecules have two energy minima (geom-1 and geom-2) and non-planar structures with considerable twists between the π-bridge and each PDI unit. Generally, as the linkage site on PDI changes from the bb′- to bo′- then to oo′-positions, the twist angles between the π-bridge and PDI units are increased due to the steric hindrance effect (see Table S1†). In contrast to the benzene unit, triazine core has smaller twist angles with the linked PDI units since the steric hindrance from the hydrogen atoms on the benzene unit is removed. It is noted that the bay-derived PDI units exhibit a torsion of ca. 17.6–18.4° in the backbone (Fig. S2†), whereas ortho-derived PDI units are planar. The two PDI units are obviously twisted for the geom-1 conformation, but nearly parallel to each other for the geom-2 conformation. Because of the relatively lower energy, we will focus more on the geom-1 conformation in the following.
Intramolecular electron transfer
To elucidate the role of π-bridge in intramolecular electron transfer, we have calculated the π-bridge-mediated super-exchange electronic coupling and direct coupling for the PDI to PDI hopping in the PDI–π–PDI compounds. As seen from Table 1, except the geom-1 of bb′-(m-Ph)PDI that has a relatively big direct electronic coupling between the two PDI monomers due to the close contact (Fig. S1†), all the compounds exhibit small direct couplings since the PDI units are spatially separated by the π-bridge, especially for the compounds with p-Ph. After taking the π-bridge into account, the effective super-exchange couplings (Veff) are significantly increased. On the whole, the variation of Veff of the m-Ph and m-Ta bridged PDI compounds is greater with respect to the p-Ph bridged PDI compounds when changing the linkage sites on PDI (bb′-, bo′-, or oo′-position). Moreover, it can be found that the bb′-linked compounds exhibit the largest Veff values for each π-bridge; especially, the Veff of bb′-(m-Ta)PDI reaches 56 meV.

To gain a deep insight into the difference in the super-exchange couplings of the studied PDI–π–PDI compounds, we employ the tight binding Hückel approximation to express the eqn (1) explicitly as follows:55 (2)here, CA1 and CA2 denote the LUMO coefficients on the linkage sites of two PDI units; Cπ1ν and Cπ2ν, the coefficients on the two linkage sites of the π bridge orbital ν; θ1 and θ2, the dihedral angles between the π-bridge and two adjacent PDI units; E and επν, the energy of adiabatic orbital in the PDI–π–PDI system and the energy of the π-bridge orbital, respectively. For simplicity, ρPDILUMO = CA1CA2, and ρπν = Cπ1νCπ2ν. The adiabatic energy can be approximately considered as the LUMO energy of PDI. Therefore, the electronic coupling for intramolecular electron transfer depends on the charge densities at the linkage atoms, the dihedral angles between the π-bridge and PDI units, and the energy difference between the PDI LUMO energy and the π-bridge orbitals. From eqn (2), the contribution from the π-bridge to the effective super-exchange coupling can be decomposed into each orbital of the π-bridge. As seen in Fig. 2 and S3,† the main contribution of the super-exchange coupling comes from the interaction of the LUMO of the PDI unit with the HOMO and LUMO of the bridge for the p-Ph/m-Ph bridged compounds but with the LUMO and LUMO+1 for the m-Ta bridged compounds.
 Fig. 2  Illustration of the molecular orbitals of the π-bridge of (a) benzene and (b) triazine that contribute to the super-exchange couplings in the studied PDI–π–PDI compounds (H: HOMO, L: LUMO). 
As shown in Fig. 3a and Table S2,† when the linkage site on PDI is changed from the bb′- to bo′- then to oo′-position, the corresponding charge density is gradually decreased. In the meanwhile, the dihedral angles are generally increased (Fig. 3b). Accordingly, the oo′-linked PDI compounds exhibit small Veff (Table 1 and Fig. 3c). Owing to a large θ2 (Table S1†), the Veff is also very small for the geom-1 of bo′-(m-Ta)PDI and the geom-2 of bo′-(m-Ph)PDI. In the case of bb′-(m-Ta)PDI, both the dihedral angles θ1 and θ2 are the smallest. In addition, the π-bridge mediated super-exchange coupling strongly correlates with the energy level alignment between the π-bridge orbitals and the LUMO of its adjacent PDI units, and is inversely proportional to the energy difference between them according to eqn (2). As displayed in Fig. 2, the PDI LUMO lies between the HOMO and LUMO levels of the π-bridge. Obviously, the HOMO–LUMO gap of m-Ta is smaller than that of p-Ph or m-Ph, and moreover, the energy level of the m-Ta LUMO is much downshifted and get closest to the PDI LUMO. Consequently, bb′-(m-Ta)PDI exhibits the largest Veff among all the studied PDI–π–PDI compounds. So the intramolecular electron transfer rate of bb′-(m-Ta)PDI would be greatly improved, which is beneficial for electron migration in the bulk and exciton dissociation at the donor–acceptor interface.18

To further investigate the effect of structural disorder on the intramolecular electron transfer caused by thermal fluctuation and intermolecular interaction, we have performed torsion potential surface scan and calculated the super-exchange couplings for the bb′-(p-Ph)PDI, bo′-(p-Ph)PDI and oo′-(p-Ph)PDI compounds considering the large computation costs (Fig. S4†). As the torsion angle is increased, the super-exchange coupling will be first decreased and then increased, and possess the minimum value at about 90°, which is consistent with eqn (2). Compared with the energy-minimum conformation, the Veff can vary by tens of meV for the conformations with a higher energy of 10 kJ mol−1, indicating a non-negligible role that the dynamic rotation can play in electron transfer.
To demonstrate the influence of intramolecular super-exchange transport on the electron moblities of the bulk, we choose bb′-(p-Ph)PDI as representative due to the large computational costs. The electron mobilities were averaged over 5 snapshots to take account of the thermal fluctuation effect (Table S3†). The electron mobility with the super-exchange mechanism considered in intramolecular transport is about 6 times higher than that with only direct coupling transport considered (Fig. 4), indicating great importance of super-exchange on the electron transport of the π-bridged PDI derivatives. To make a further confirmation, we simulated three independent samples of different molecular packing morphologies and calculated their electron mobilities. The obtained results confirm a very small standard deviation (ca. 9%) of the electron mobilities among the different samples (Table S3†).

Optical absorption
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the investigated PDI–π–PDI compounds are shown in Fig. 5. All the compounds exhibit a broad absorption in the range of 300–700 nm and have two absorption peaks, resembling that of the PDI monomer. We notice that the maximum absorption peak and intensity of oo′-linked compounds are similar to those of the prototype PDI in the range of 400–600 nm, while the absorption of bb′- and bo′-linked compounds is bathochromic-shifted with the intensity slightly decreased. For instance, from bb′-(p-Ph)PDI to bo′-(p-Ph)PDI and oo′-(p-Ph)PDI, the absorption peak is blue-shifted from 513 to 494 and 485 nm (Table S4†). This can be attributed to the better planarity of PDI backbone in the oo′-linked compounds, which is beneficial to maintain the properties of the PDI monomer. Correspondingly, the oo′-linked compounds possess larger HOMO–LUMO gap with respect to the bb′- and bo′-linked ones (Fig. S6†), which compares well with the experiment results.56 In a word, modifying the linking positions on PDI can change both the absorption position and intensity.

As seen from Fig. 5, the different π-bridge cores mainly influence the optical absorption in the high-energy range of 300–400 nm. Compared with the benzene-bridged compounds, the triazine bridge compounds show stronger absorption in this range, especially when incorporation with bb′-linked PDI units. Hence, when bb′-(m-Ta)PDI is combined with the polymer donor of PTB7-Th that shows strong absorption in the long wavelength range of 550–750 nm, the resultant complementary light harvest can lead to higher short-circuit current and PCE of the photovoltaic devices.18
Conclusions
In summary, we have systematically investigated the influences of different π-bridge cores and linking positions on the electronic and optical properties of representative dimeric PDI derivatives. Our results demonstrate that the intramolecular electron transfer for the dimeric PDI–π–PDI derivatives is mainly dominated by the super-exchange mechanism. The super-exchange coupling is determined by the dihedral angle and energy level alignment between the π-bridge and PDI units as well as the LUMO densities at the linkage sites of PDI. It is found that the bb′-linked PDI dimers exhibit the relatively larger electronic couplings owing to the higher LUMO density on the bay position of PDI and the smaller dihedral angles between π-bridge and PDI units. Furthermore, when the π-bridge is changed from benzene to triazine, the resultant smaller energy level difference between the LUMOs of π-bridge and PDI can greatly improve the super-exchange coupling. Additionally, it is illustrated that the optical absorption of PDI–π–PDI derivatives can also be tuned by the central π-bridge cores and linking positions. The results show that the bay-substituted PDIs exhibit low-lying LUMO energy levels and bathochromic-shifted absorption but slightly decreased absorption intensity than the ortho-substituted PDIs. The light absorption at the short wave-length range can be regulated by the different π-bridges. Our work provides molecular insights into the intramolecular electron transfer and optical properties for PDI–π–PDI derivatives and would be useful for rational design of high-performance electron acceptors based on π-bridged multiple PDI moieties for organic photovoltaics.
