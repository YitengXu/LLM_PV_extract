    , Accepted 21st September 2015First published on 25th September 2015AbstractOleic acid-stabilized hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals, emitting green and red luminescence, were prepared by the high-temperature co-precipitation of lanthanide chlorides. By varying the reaction time and the Ln3+/Na+ ratio, the nanocrystal size can be controlled within the range 16–270 nm. The maximum upconversion quantum yield is achieved under 970 nm excitation. The reverse microemulsion technique using hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethoxysilane is a suitable method to coat the nanocrystal surface with a silica shell to make the particles dispersible and colloidally stable in aqueous media. During the subsequent functionalization, (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane introduced amino groups onto the silica to enable future bioconjugation with the target molecules. All specimens were characterized by TEM microscopy, electron and X-ray diffraction, ATR FT-IR spectroscopy, and upconversion luminescence. Finally, in vitro cytotoxicity and intracellular nanoparticle uptake (using confocal microscopy) were determined with human cervical carcinoma HeLa and mRoGFP HeLa cells, respectively. From the investigated particles, amino-functionalized NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals internalized into the cells most efficiently. The nanoparticles proved to be nontoxic at moderate concentrations, which is important when considering their prospective application in biolabeling and luminescence imaging of various cell types.
1. Introduction
In recent years, a broad variety of luminescent nanoparticles of different sizes, shapes and compositions have been reported.1 Luminescent nanomaterials including organic dyes,2 quantum dots3 and upconversion nanoparticles were obtained by a range of chemical methods and have found various applications, such as solar cells,4 media for data storage,5 photocatalysis,6 photodynamic therapy,7 biological imaging and labeling.8 The disadvantage of ultraviolet light as a source for excitation of organic dyes and quantum dots is that it damages biological tissue, and has low penetration depth and high background autofluorescence. In contrast, near infrared light (NIR) is noninvasive and falls in the “optical window” of biological tissues.9 Photo-damage to tissues is thus minimized and in vivo imaging can be easily achieved due to the deep penetration of NIR radiation into the tissue. Upconversion nanocrystals have been suggested as a promising new class of luminescent materials, which are capable of producing visible light by energy transfer upconversion (ETU) of NIR radiation.10 ETU is a nonlinear optical process based on the sequential absorption of two or more photons which converts long-wavelength excitation into shorter wavelength radiation.11 In comparison with other luminescent materials, such as organic dyes2 and quantum dots,3 upconversion nanocrystals have shown superior chemical and optical features like narrow emission peaks,12 resistance to bleaching,13 chemical stability,14 and the absence of blinking effects.15 After being excited by NIR light, their sharp emission peaks appear due to the intra-4f electronic transitions of rare earth ions (e.g., Yb+3 and Er3+).16,17
Upconversion nanoparticles are typically composed of a chemically and thermally stable inorganic fluoride host lattice (e.g., NaYF4) possessing low photon energies (∼350 cm−1) to prevent non-radiative energy losses; at the same time the lattice accommodates dopant trivalent lanthanide ions.18 Optically inert Y3+ ions have superior physical and chemical properties with similar valence states as the optically active rare earth ions. Lanthanide ions enhancing upconversion efficiency can be divided into two groups: activators emitting visible light and sensitizers acting as energy donors.19 The high luminescence efficiency of upconversion nanoparticles can be achieved by precise concentrations of sensitizers and activators. Optimal sensitizers should have large absorption cross-sections corresponding to the activator energy level. Yb3+ ions are frequently used sensitizers which absorb NIR light and donate the energy to an activator (e.g., Er3+, Ho3+ and Tm3+) due to the similar energy of the excited state.20 The emission of the photons at a shorter wavelength than the excitation wavelength occurs by the relaxation of Er3+ from an excited to the ground state, emitting thus green and red light.21 High-quality NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals are usually synthesized by the high-temperature co-precipitation method of lanthanide chlorides in the presence of organic solvents, e.g., oleic acid or oleylamine.22 Oleic acid on the crystal surface provides stability against aggregation and controls the particle growth, moreover, it makes crystals hydrophobic due to long hydrocarbon chains. The high-temperature co-precipitation yields upconversion nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution and a diameter that can be regulated by the stoichiometry of the reagents. The adjustment of Na+ and F− concentrations in the reaction system also controls the morphology of the nanocrystals. Depending on synthetic conditions, the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ crystal structure exhibits two phases: cubic (α) and hexagonal (β). The latter phase is known to be less symmetric23 (compared to cubic), which increases the luminescence efficiency by increasing the crystal field strength.19
In praxis, the upconversion nanocrystals have to fulfill several requirements, such as water-dispersibility (no aggregation), uniformity in size, biocompatibility and the presence of functional groups on the surface to make the successive conjugation of biomolecules possible. It is therefore necessary to develop a facile low-cost modification of the nanoparticle surface, e.g., with silica or polymer monolayers. Incorporation of the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals into the silica shell has been already achieved by the water-in-oil (w/o) reverse microemulsion approach using the nonionic Igepal 520 stabilizer and ammonium hydroxide-catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation of the tetramethylorthosilicate.24 The advantage of silica is its biocompatibility and modifiability with amino, carboxyl and thiol groups.25 Binding of biomolecules (e.g., peptides, proteins and DNA) can be then achieved by standard covalent bioconjugation techniques, such as hydrolysis of succinimidyl esters, carbodiimide chemistry and disulfide-coupling.26
The aim of this report is to prepare upconversion hexagonal nanoparticles and further modification of their surface with silica and its amino derivative for the final investigation of in vitro cytotoxicity and/or intracellular uptake by human cervical carcinoma cell lines. The effect of reaction parameters, such as Ln3+/Na+ ratio, temperature and reaction time, on the morphological, physical and biological properties of the resulting particles is therefore elucidated. This can have an impact on the mechanism of nanoparticle internalization by cells and future applications such as therapeutic or diagnostic tools.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals and materials
Anhydrous yttrium(III), ytterbium(III) and erbium(III) chlorides (99%), ammonium hydrogen difluoride, 1-octadecene (90%), tetramethoxysilicate (TMOS; >99%), (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and Igepal CO-520 (polyoxyethylene(5) nonylphenyl ether) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Sodium and ammonium hydroxide were obtained from Lach-Ner (Neratovice, Czech Republic). Oleic acid (OA), methanol, ethanol, and acetone were from Lachema (Brno, Czech Republic). All reagents were used as received.
HeLa human cervical carcinoma cell lines were kindly provided by Dr Mělkova (1st Medical Faculty of Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic) and mRoGFP HeLa cells (Institute of Physiology, Prague, Czech Republic) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with heat inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U per ml penicillin and 100 μg per ml streptomycin.
2.2 Synthesis of oleic acid-stabilized NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals
Oleic acid (OA)-stabilized NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals were prepared according to an earlier described procedure27 with some modifications. In the typical procedure, 1.5 mmol of lanthanide chlorides (1.2 mmol YCl3, 0.27 mmol YbCl3 and 0.03 mmol ErCl3) were charged into a 100 ml 3-neck flask, 1-octadecene (15 ml) and OA (6 ml) were added and the mixture was heated to 160 °C for 30 min until a homogeneous solution was obtained. The flask was then cooled down to room temperature and a solution of NH4F·HF (2.4 mmol) and NaOH (2.5 mmol) in methanol (10 ml) was added dropwise. The resulting mixture was slowly heated up to 70 °C until methanol was evaporated, gently purged with argon, heated to 300 °C for 90 min, then cooled to room temperature and transferred into 15 ml centrifuge tubes. The NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ crystals were precipitated by the addition of acetone (10 ml), separated using a Sorvall Legend X1 centrifuge (ThermoFisher; Osterode, Germany), washed with ethanol three times, and, finally, transferred into hexane. For in vitro cell viability experiments, the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals were washed with an ethanol/water mixture (1/1 v/v) and water five times each.
2.3 Surface modification of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals by silica
The NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals were coated by using a thin silica shell using a reverse microemulsion process28 with slight changes. Typically, dispersion of nanocrystals (30 mg) in hexane (10 ml) was mixed with Igepal CO-520 (0.5 ml) and 25% NH4OH (0.08 ml) under sonication (Sonopuls sonicator; Bandelin; Berlin, Germany) for 30 min. TMOS (0.02 ml) was then added and the reaction continued for 48 h. Amino-functionalized silica-coated NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals were prepared by adding APTES (0.01 ml) into the reaction mixture and the reaction continued for 24 h. The resulting NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2 and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 nanocrystals were precipitated by the addition of acetone (10 ml), separated by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and dispersed in water.
2.4 Characterization of the nanocrystals

Electron microscopy. 
The morphology, composition and crystal structure of the particles were investigated by using a Tecnai G2 Spirit Twin 12 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM; FEI; Brno, Czech Republic). Size and particle size distribution were determined by measuring at least 500 particles from five random TEM/bright field (BF) micrographs using Atlas software (Tescan, Brno, Czech Republic). Number- (Dn), weight-average diameter (Dw) and the uniformity (polydispersity index PDI) were calculated as follows: Dn = ∑NiDi/∑Ni,(1) Dw = ∑NiDi4/∑NiDi3,(2) PDI = Dw/Dn,(3)where Ni and Di are the number and diameter of the particles, respectively. The TEM microscope was equipped with an EDAX energy dispersive spectrometer (Mahwah, NJ, USA), which was used for analysis of the elemental composition of the nanoparticles. The crystal structure was determined by selected area electron diffraction (SAED). TEM/SAED diffraction patterns were processed with Process Diffraction software29 and compared with those calculated by using PowderCell software30 and/or downloaded from crystallographic databases.


Wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). 
WAXS was measured on a Rigaku MolMet instrument using image plates and a pinhole camera (Molecular Metrology System; Tokyo, Japan) attached to a microfocused X-ray beam generator (Osmic MicroMax 002) operating at 45 kV and 0.66 mA.22 The camera was equipped with 23 × 25 cm removable imaging plates (Fujifilm).


ATR FT-IR spectroscopy. 
Infrared spectra were recorded using a Nexus Nicolet 870 FT-IR spectrometer (Madison, WI, USA) equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. All spectra were recorded using a Golden Gate single attenuated total reflection (ATR) crystal (Specac; Slough, UK). The spectra (256 scans) were acquired at a resolution of 4 cm−1 at room temperature. Water vapor (atmospheric spectrum) and background were subtracted from the spectra.


Upconversion luminescence. 
Luminescence spectra were recorded on a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal inverted fluorescence microscope (Mannheim, Germany) using a PL APO 100×/1.40–0.70 oil immersion objective (pinhole 1 Airy unit) and a Coherent Chameleon Ultra Ti:sapphire laser (Santa Clara, CA, USA) at 970 nm excitation with correction on a power laser at different wavelengths. The NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 nanoparticle (0.01 g) dispersions in hexane and water, respectively, were placed on a cover glass using a spin coating technique.



In vitro viability of HeLa cells incubated with NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+, NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2 and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 nanocrystals. 
5 × 103 HeLa cells were seeded into 100 μl of high glucose DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated FBS, 10 IU per ml penicillin, and 100 μg per ml streptomycin in 96-well flat-bottom plates (TPP; Prague, Czech Republic) at 37 °C for 24 h, and the nanocrystals were added at concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1 mg ml−1 and cell cultivation was continued at 37 °C for 72 h under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. 10 μl of alamarBlue® cell viability reagent (Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA, USA) was then added to each well and the incubation continued for an additional 4 h. Resazurin as the active component of the alamarBlue® reagent was reduced to highly fluorescent resorufin only in metabolically active viable cells. Fluorescence was detected using a Synergy Neo plate reader (Bio-Tek; Winooski, VT, USA) under excitation at 570 nm and emission at 600 nm. Cells cultivated in the medium without the nanocrystals served as control. Two wells were used for each concentration and the assay was repeated three times.


Confocal imaging of mRoGFP HeLa cells incubated with nanocrystals. 
The HeLa human cervical carcinoma cell line stably expressing matrix targeted redox-sensitive GFP (mRoGFP) was cultivated in DMEM medium without glucose supplemented with 3 mM glutamine, 5% (v/v) glucose-free dialyzed FCS, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 10 IU per ml penicillin, 100 μg per ml streptomycin, and 10 mM galactose at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. The cells were then cultured for 3–4 days on poly(L-lysine)-coated coverslips to 70% confluency and incubated with NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals (1 mg ml−1) for 48 h under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Fluorescence images of the labeled cells were taken using the same confocal microscope as described above. While mRoGFP was excited at 488 nm with a 20 mW argon laser, the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals were excited at 970 nm with a Chameleon Ultra Ti:sapphire laser and 140 fs pulse width. The images and their overlays were manually contrasted and the brightness was adjusted by using Image J software (National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD, USA).


Analyses of colocalization and correlation of images by using Pearson's and Mander's coefficients. 
The Pearson's (PCC) and the Mander's overlap coefficients (MOC) are used to quantify the degree of colocalization between fluorophores, i.e., emission of GFP and nanocrystals.
PCC is given as follows: (4)
MOC is given as follows: (5)where Ri is the intensity of the first fluorophore in individual pixels and Rav is the arithmetic mean, whereas Gi and Gav are the corresponding intensities for the second fluorophore in the same pixels.31 All analyses were performed using Image J software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals
Two-step high-temperature co-precipitation of three lanthanide chlorides has been selected as a suitable technique for the synthesis of the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals. First, lanthanide chlorides were dissolved in a mixture of 1-octadecene and OA as a surface binding ligand and heated to 160 °C. Second, NaOH and NH4F·HF as a source of Na+ and F− ions, respectively, were added and the mixture was heated to 300 °C and kept at this temperature for 1.5 h producing hexagon shaped NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals. Throughout the experiments, the amounts of both NH4F·HF and NaOH were held constant at 2.4 and 2.5 mmol, respectively. The OA stabilizer controlled the particle size and hindered particle agglomeration.32 Stabilization was achieved by adsorption of OA on the nanocrystal surface via interactions between the lanthanide ions and the OA carboxyl groups. Hydrophobic OA alkyl chains then stabilized the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ crystals enabling thus their dispersibility in nonpolar solvents, e.g., hexane or toluene. In such solvents, the crystals were individual without any tendency to aggregate. In the following experiments, the effect of changing experimental conditions, such as concentrations of the reactants, ion ratios and reaction time, on the crystal size and shape was investigated. All the experiments were performed more than five times and the properties of the nanocrystals were reproducible.
3.2 Effect of Ln3+/Na+ ratios
The Ln3+/Na+ ratio strongly influenced both the crystal morphology and phase. Typical TEM micrographs of hydrophobic NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals are shown in Fig. 1a and d. While the Ln3+/Na+ ratio was tuned from 1/2.5 to 1.5/2.5 (mol mol−1), other reaction parameters, such as the reaction temperature (300 °C) and time (90 min), were kept constant. At Ln3+/Na+ = 1/2.5 (mol mol−1), polydisperse (PDI = 1.16) spherical crystals of 26 nm number-average diameter were prepared (Fig. 1a). At the 1.5/2.5 ratio (mol mol−1), flat hexagon-shaped crystals were obtained with Dn = 266 nm and PDI = 1.01 confirming the monodispersity of the product (Fig. 1d). Dark stripes passing through the nanocrystals displayed thickness and bend contours and/or dislocations (Fig. 1d) that are quite common in the TEM micrographs of inorganic crystals.33 The 1.5/2.5 ratio (mol mol−1) can be thus considered as optimal from the point of view of the formation of monodisperse crystals with a pure hexagonal phase. At a higher concentration of Ln3+ ions (Ln3+/Na+ = 3/2.5 mol mol−1), the average crystal size and reproducibility of the syntheses tended to decrease (results not shown). SAED and EDAX analyses of the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ crystals are summarized in Fig. 1b, c and e, g. Surprisingly, TEM/SAED analyses reveal that the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ particles crystallized in both cubic and hexagonal phases for Ln3+/Na+ = 1/2.5 mol mol−1 (Fig. 1b and c), whereas Ln3+/Na+ = 1.5/2.5 mol mol−1 resulted in the pure hexagonal phase corresponding to Na(Y0.57Yb0.39Er0.04)F434 (Fig. 1d–f). In all experiments, TEM/EDAX analyses confirm the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composition (the typical EDAX spectrum is shown in Fig. 1g). While Na, Y, F and Yb peaks were clearly visible, the Er peak was not detected due to trace amounts of this element. The Cu and C peaks in EDAX spectra originated from the standard carbon-coated copper support grid used in TEM. It should be noted that crystalline phases of the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ particles prepared at two Ln3+/Na+ ratios qualitatively differed at the first sight as evidenced from comparison of the electron diffraction patterns (Fig. 1b and e). At Ln3+/Na+ = 1/2.5 mol mol−1, the number of diffraction rings (Fig. 1b) is higher than for the 1.5/2.5 ratio (Fig. 1e). The additional peaks in Fig. 1b are identified as the cubic phase of NaYF4. It is also worth noting that the flat hexagonal crystals (Fig. 1d) exhibited a strong preferred orientation and most of them were laid on the (100) plane. Consequently, their SAED zone axis was [001] and the pattern (Fig. 1e) was dominated by hk0 diffractions, whereas the hkl diffractions with l ≠ 0 exhibited negligible intensity (Fig. 1f). In Fig. 1f, the strong hk0 and weak hkl diffractions are denoted by the bold and normal fonts, respectively. Considering this strong preferred orientation, the SAED pattern of the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals (Fig. 1e and f) corresponded exactly to the above described hexagonal Na(Y0.57Yb0.39Er0.04)F4 phase as described in the literature.34,35 Moreover, WAXS analysis of the hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals obtained at Ln3+/Na+ = 1.5/2.5 mol mol−1 displayed very sharp peaks at positions corresponding to the hexagonal phase (Fig. 2). It can be thus concluded that both the TEM and WAXS results proved high purity of the hexagonal-phase NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals synthesized at Ln3+/Na+ = 1.5/2.5 mol mol−1.

XRD patterns in (c, f) were calculated from database crystal structures as described in the Experimental section.

3.3 Effect of reaction time
The second series of experiments involved synthesis of the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals at different reaction times: 30, 60 and 90 min. The Ln3+/Na+ ratio of 1.5/2.5 (mol mol−1) and the reaction temperature of 300 °C were kept constant. The nanocrystal size grew from 16 to 266 nm with increasing reaction time (Fig. 3); at the same time, the crystal size distribution became narrower. The size of the crystals synthesized for 30 min was small (16 nm) and their polydispersity index was rather broad (PDI = 1.4; Fig. 3a) indicating that the hexagonal crystal growth was not completed. If the reaction time increased to 60 min, the hexagonal crystal size increased to 160 nm, however, a second family of tiny primary particles (∼3–9 nm) not participating in the particle growth was still detectable (Fig. 3b). Finally, when the reaction time increased to 90 min, large monodisperse hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals (266 nm) were formed and the tiny particles disappeared suggesting the completed growth stage during the particle formation. It should be mentioned that with the reaction time increasing to 120 min, the crystal size and shape remained the same as for the 90 min reaction time. The latter particles were therefore selected for the next experiments.

3.4 Surface modification of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals with silica
The disadvantage of the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals is their hydrophobic character, which means that they are well-dispersible in nonpolar solvents (e.g., hexane), but not in water, the medium for biomedical applications. It is therefore necessary to change the hydrophobicity for the hydrophilicity, which in turn will make the crystals water-dispersible.
Silica was selected as a suitable coating which offers several benefits, such as facile and cheap synthesis, good colloidal stability in water, chemical inertness, optical transparency and amenability to chemical modifications.36 In this report, silica coating was produced by the water-in-oil microemulsion method. To document possible subsequent functionalization of silica by different reactants, the amino groups were introduced on the surface by the reaction with APTES. The amino groups are convenient to bind nanoparticles with biomolecules containing carboxyl, N-hydroxysuccinimide, isothiocyanate, azide, oxirane or aldehyde groups. The amino group-containing nanocrystals can thus conjugate with almost all kinds of peptides or proteins.26 As can be seen from comparison of TEM micrographs of the starting hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 nanocrystals, the silica shell completely covered the crystals forming a core–shell structure (Fig. 4). The thickness of the silica shell was approximately 5 nm.

In order to confirm the presence of the silica shell on the nanocrystals, they were analyzed by ATR FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig. 5). The spectrum of the starting NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals exhibited characteristic bands of the oleyl chains at 2922 and 2857 cm−1 due to asymmetric and symmetric CH2 stretching vibrations, respectively (Fig. 5a). Another intensive peak at 1680 cm−1 was attributed to the CC stretching vibrations of OA. In addition, two bands at 1550 and 1460 cm−1 corresponded to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the COO− groups.32 After the crystal modification, characteristic absorption OA bands completely disappeared in NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2 and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 spectra (Fig. 5b and c). A new large broad band with a maximum at ∼3435 cm−1 and a peak at 1630 cm−1 was likely caused by overlapping stretching and bending –OH/–NH vibrations. A very strong and broad band attributed to the symmetrical stretching Si–O–Si vibrations was observed at 1080 cm−1. In addition, the bands at 950 and 795 cm−1 were attributed to Si–OH and asymmetric SiO4 stretching vibrations, respectively. In the spectrum of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2, two peaks at 2922 and 2851 cm−1 corresponded to the asymmetric and symmetric methylene stretching vibrations, respectively, due to hydrolysis of APTES. The formation of a thin amino-functionalized or neat silica shell around the hexagon-shaped NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals was thus confirmed by both TEM and ATR FT-IR results.

3.5 Upconversion luminescence
Hexagonal NaYF4 nanocrystals doped with optically active Yb3+/Er3+ ion pairs are known as one of the most efficient host materials for the conversion of NIR into visible light.37 Dependence of the photoluminescence intensity of emitted light on the excitation wavelength ranging from 920 to 990 nm exhibited a maximum at 970 nm (Fig. 6a and b) ascribed to the fact that the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+ ions overlapped the 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 transition of Er3+ ions. This description is in agreement with the published absorption spectra of the Yb3+/Er3+ ion pair measured in the 300–1700 nm range.17,38

After absorption of NIR photons at 970 nm, the 2F7/2 exited state of the Yb3+ ions became populated and the energy was non-radiatively transferred to the Er3+ ions forming the 4I11/2 excited state (Fig. 6b). With absorption of the second NIR photon, the Er3+ ions reached an even higher energy state. The characteristic Er3+ emission corresponding to green light at 510–530 nm and 530–570 nm is attributed to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, respectively;39 red light at 640–680 nm was ascribed to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition (Fig. 6b). The emission of green and red light, due to simultaneous ETU of two NIR photons at 970 nm, did not change the shape and position of peaks in the upconversion spectrum after coating the starting hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals with amino-silica (Fig. 6c). Compared with the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+, the intensity of the emitted light of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 decreased negligibly.
3.6 Viability of HeLa cells incubated with hexagonal lanthanide nanocrystals
As a conventional approach to examine the biocompatibility of the starting and surface-modified hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals, the human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cell viability assay was selected to document the in vitro cytotoxicity of particles. After three days of cell incubation with hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+, NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2 and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 nanocrystals (1 μg–1 mg ml−1), the cytotoxicity of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2 nanocrystals was not observed. However, the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 nanocrystals exhibited concentration-dependent toxicity (Fig. 7). The cytotoxicity was calculated as the IC 50 value, which indicated the amount of the nanocrystals needed to inhibit cell proliferation by half (50%). The IC 50 value for NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 nanocrystals was 0.54 ± 0.147 mg ml−1. Fig. 7 shows the influence of the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 concentration on cell viability after three-day incubation. The viability of HeLa cells incubated with nanocrystals at the concentration of 250 μg ml−1 significantly differed from that at 500 μg of particles per ml. At concentrations ≤250 μg ml−1, no cytotoxicity was detected, however, viability decreased to 40 and 10% of the control, if 500 μg and 1 mg of nanocrystals, respectively, were present per ml of the cell incubation medium. The cytotoxicity of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2, in contrast to the other two types of nanocrystals, can be ascribed to positively charged amino groups promoting infiltration through the cytoplasmic membrane. This might result in an increased accumulation of the particles on and/or inside the cells as shown by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 8).

(b) Overlays of (a) and upconversion luminescence (excitation at 970 nm and detection at 500–700 nm). 
3.7 Fluorescence of hexagonal lanthanide-labeled mRoGFP HeLa cells and upconversion imaging
The hexagonal lanthanide nanocrystal-labeled mRoGFP HeLa cells were investigated by confocal inverted fluorescence microscopy at several planes under 488 and 970 nm excitation. At the first excitation wavelength (488 nm) the mitochondrial network was found to be distributed in the cells (Fig. 8a, A–C; Table 1). The normal undamaged cells showed interconnected tubules of the mitochondrial network (Fig. 8a, A–C). If the cells were markedly damaged, the original mitochondrial network would be disintegrated forming small spherical fragments.40 Because confocal microscopy observation of cells incubated with the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 nanocrystals, which displayed cytotoxicity, if used at high concentrations (>250 μg ml−1), was done at a shorter time than the measurement of cytotoxicity, the mitochondria were without marked damage. At the second excitation wavelength (970 nm), the nanoparticles were viewed and the optimum visualization plane for both the cell interior and nanocrystals was then selected. Fig. 8b, A–C, show the overlaid images of the mitochondrial network and nanoparticles at the same confocal plane, while Table 1 summarizes the intensity of overlaps by using the Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) and the Mander's overlap coefficient (MOC). The coefficients quantify the degree of colocalization between fluorophores, i.e., emission of GFP and nanocrystals, documenting thus the crystal internalization efficiency. Using this approach, the initial hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+-, NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2- and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2-labeled mRoGFP HeLa cells were compared. From all the investigated particles, minimum internalization was observed for the neat NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ crystals (Table 1). The NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2 and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 crystals exhibited higher, but equal cell penetration (Table 1). However, the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 nanocrystals displayed significant cytotoxicity at concentrations >250 μg ml−1 (Fig. 7). Again, this can be caused by positive charges in comparison with the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2 crystals, which did not show any cytotoxicity and can be thus considered as biocompatible. It is needless to say that nontoxicity and the ability of the nanoparticles to penetrate the cells are crucial for the prospective application of lanthanide nanocrystals in biomedicine.

4. Conclusions
Lanthanide-doped upconversion nanocrystals have recently received a lot of attention due to their possible biomedical applications. Monodisperse, hexagon shaped, oleic acid-stabilized NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals were synthesized by the high-temperature co-precipitation of lanthanide chlorides. By tuning the initial Ln3+ and Na+ concentrations and reaction times, the particle size and shape were regulated. TEM/BF micrographs, TEM/EDAX spectra and TEM/SAED diffraction patterns proved that the nanocrystals with a properly adjusted Ln3+/Na+ ratio (1.5/2.5 mol mol−1) exhibited the morphology of flat hexagons (size 266 nm) with a narrow size distribution and a pure hexagonal crystal phase, which is optimal for light upconversion. The hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals were coated by using a thin silica shell obtained from hydrolysis and condensation of tetramethoxysilicate via the reverse microemulsion method using an amphiphilic Igepal CO-520 surfactant. The additional silica layer was attached by the reaction with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane to introduce amino groups and produce NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 nanocrystals suitable for subsequent bioconjugation of the target biomolecule. The successful coating of nanocrystals with silica was confirmed by TEM and ATR FT-IR analysis. Upon NIR irradiation (970 nm), the nanocrystals emitted green and red fluorescence of Er3+ ions. The interactions of hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+, NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2 and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 nanocrystals with HeLa cells were then analyzed. The experiments proved the non-toxicity of the hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2 crystals, while the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+&SiO2-NH2 particles at concentrations >250 μg ml−1 were toxic. Fluorescence images confirmed internalization of the hexagonal crystals by the mRoGFP HeLa cells and together with the cytotoxic study, suitable particles could be selected for future applications in biology and medicine. Due to the relatively large size of the nanoparticles (266–276 nm), a high luminescence efficiency of the labeled cells was achieved, enabling their monitoring both in short- and long-time periods. This will allow elucidation of the mechanism of particle trafficking in the cells. The system can be thus considered as a model for future investigation of clinically relevant particles for diagnosis and/or photodynamic therapy of tumors, e.g., melanoblastomas.
