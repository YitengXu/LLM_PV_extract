    , Accepted 27th January 2018First published on 29th January 2018AbstractPlasmonic metal–semiconductor heteronanostructures with controlled topologies have attracted increasing attention as promising platforms for the efficient conversion of solar to chemical energy. Herein, we describe a novel synthesis route toward the formation of heteronanostructures with plasmonic metal yolks and semiconductor shells, which can enable the enhancement of light harvesting efficiency. Au nanorod-CdS yolk–shell nanostructures with well-defined structural configurations were realized by sulfidation and a subsequent cation exchange reaction with pre-synthesized Au nanorod@Ag core–shell nanostructures. The prepared yolk–shell nanostructures showed superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance under visible light irradiation over their core–shell nanostructured counterparts, CdS hollow nanoparticles, and Au nanorods. A series of mechanistic studies on the photocatalysis distinctly corroborated that the pronounced photocatalytic function of the yolk–shell nanostructures is due to the synergism between the radiative relaxation of the plasmon energy of the Au nanorod yolks and the multiple reflections of the incident light within their voids provided by the yolk–shell structure, which can promote the light absorption of CdS that can drive the photocatalysis. This study can provide a new perspective for designing hetero-nanoarchitectures with intended structures and desired functions.
Introduction
Solar-driven photocatalytic reactions, such as hydrogen and oxygen evolution, CO2 reduction, and water decontamination, have been intensively explored due to the increase in energy demand and environmental issues.1–4 Nanostructured semiconductor materials have been widely employed as photocatalysts due to their electron–hole pair generation capability under light irradiation, which can drive the redox reactions of nearby molecules.5,6 However, the low efficiency of semiconductor photocatalysts on account of their limited range of light absorption and rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs retards the practical applications of photocatalysis systems.7,8 Accordingly, enormous efforts have been made to modify the inherent characteristics of semiconductor nanomaterials through control over their facets,9–11 dopants,12–14 crystallinity,15–17 and phases18–20 to address the above issues. In addition, the manipulation of the structure of semiconductor nanomaterials has also been extensively investigated to increase the light utilization efficiency.21–23 In particular, yolk–shell nanostructures of semiconductors have been introduced to enhance the light absorption efficiency because they can provide the multiple reflections of incident light within the void between yolks and shells and thus lead to the prolongation of the average path length of incident photons.24,25 Specifically, TiO2 (ref. 24) and WO3·1/3H2O25 yolk–shell nanostructures have exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic activities towards the degradation of phenol and methyl orange, respectively, due to their improved light absorption.
The photocatalytic efficiency of semiconductor nanomaterials can also be promoted by the adoption of metal nanocrystals (NCs) with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) characteristics as light harvesting materials.26–28 Plasmonic excitation of metal NCs in metal–semiconductor heteronanostructures upon light irradiation can boost the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor through increasing the charge carrier, i.e., electron and hole, density of the semiconductor by the plasmon energy transfer from the metal to the semiconductor. The plasmon energy of the metal can be transferred to the semiconductor through the radiative relaxation of SPR, including near-field enhancement and resonant photon scattering, which can enhance the light absorption of the semiconductor and the hot electron transfer (HET) or plasmon-induced resonant energy transfer (PIRET) process.29–33 Given these previous findings, plasmonic metal–semiconductor hybrid materials with yolk–shell nanostructures can be considered as promising photocatalysts. In fact, few successes have been reported for the preparation of photocatalyst systems based on plasmonic metal–semiconductor yolk–shell nanostructures.34–36 However, the development of synthesis methods that can enable the generation of heteronanostructures with precisely controlled structural characteristics is still highly required to fully harness the inherent plasmonic and catalytic functions of the constituent materials. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of the plasmon-enhanced photocatalytic function of metal–semiconductor yolk–shell nanostructures, which is the key to the design of high-performance solar energy conversion platforms, remains a controversial issue.
Here, we report a novel synthesis approach for the production of yolk–shell nanostructures consisting of plasmonic metal NC yolks and semiconductor shells and their photocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. Au nanorod-CdS yolk–shell nanostructures (AuNR-CdS YSNs) with well-defined structural components, i.e., yolks, shells, and voids, were successfully generated by sulfidation and a subsequent cation exchange reaction with preformed AuNR@Ag core–shell nanostructures (AuNR@Ag CSNs), which were prepared through the conformal overgrowth of Ag shells on AuNR surfaces. The AuNR@Ag CSNs were transformed into AuNR@Ag@Ag2S core–shell–shell nanostructures (AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs) during the sulfidation reaction. The Ag2S domain in the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs could then be converted into CdS via the cation exchange reaction, during which the outward diffusion of the Ag inner shell occurred, resulting in the development of AuNR-CdS YSNs. The prepared AuNR-CdS YSNs exhibited significantly enhanced activity for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light (λ > 400 nm) irradiation in comparison to CdS hollow nanoparticles (CdS HNPs), AuNR@CdS core–shell nanostructures (AuNR@CdS CSNs), and pristine AuNRs. This clearly demonstrates that the synergism between multiple photon reflections provided by the yolk–shell structure and the plasmonic function of AuNR yolks can promote the light harvesting efficiency and thus lead to the pronounced hydrogen evolution activity of the AuNR-CdS YSNs. Through a series of mechanistic studies on photocatalysis, we revealed that the promotional effect of AuNR yolks on photocatalysis can be attributed primarily to the radiative relaxation of their plasmon energy.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of AuNR-CdS YSNs
The synthesis route toward the formation of the AuNR-CdS YSNs is depicted in Fig. 1a (see the Experimental section for synthesis details). The first step involved the reduction of Ag+ ions using ascorbic acid (AA) as a reducing agent on pre-synthesized AuNRs with an average diameter and length of 24.3 and 71.0 nm, respectively (the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image and X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the AuNRs are shown in Fig. 1b and S1,† respectively). TEM, high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM), and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images, EDS cross-sectional compositional line profiles, and XRD pattern of the product demonstrate that the conformal overgrowth of Ag on the AuNRs yielded AuNR@Ag CSNs with average Ag shell thicknesses of 18.8 and 12.8 nm at the sides and tips of the AuNRs, respectively (Fig. 1c and 2a–e). The EDS-determined Ag/Au atomic ratio of the AuNR@Ag CSNs was 4.2. During the second step, the sulfidation reaction of the prepared AuNR@Ag CSNs with Na2S resulted in the formation of AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs having average Ag@Ag2S layer thicknesses of 21.9 and 12.3 nm in the side and tip regions of the AuNR cores, respectively (Fig. 1d and 2f–j). The XRD pattern of the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks of the monoclinic structure of Ag2S, revealing the conversion from Ag to Ag2S (Fig. 2j). The EDS-determined Au:Ag:S atomic ratio of the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs was 19.5:61.7:18.8, indicating that 38% of the Ag shells of the AuNR@Ag CSNs were converted to Ag2S. Apparently, the existence of Ag inner shells in the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs was corroborated by the drastic decrease in the S signal with the conservation of the Ag signal between the AuNR and Ag2S domains in the HAADF-STEM-EDS elemental mapping images and cross-sectional compositional line profiles of the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs (Fig. 2h and i). The observation of the S signal in the region of the AuNR domains is due to the similarity between the EDS peak positions of S (Kα at 2.307 keV) and Au (Mα at 2.120 keV). Depth-profiling of the composition of the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further confirmed their core–shell–shell structure (Fig. 3a). As the sputtering time of the X-ray beam increased, the S composition gradually decreased, while the Ag and Au compositions increased.

The final product, AuNR-CdS YSNs, evolved through the cation exchange reaction of the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs with Cd(NO3)2 in methanol in the presence of tributylphosphine (TBP) (Fig. 1a). The generated AuNR-CdS YSNs had a uniform size and shape with the average length and diameter of 111.5 and 85.3 nm, respectively (Fig. 1e and S2†). The voids between the AuNR yolks and the CdS shells were clearly identified in the TEM and HAADF-STEM images of the AuNR-CdS YSNs (Fig. 2k and l). The average gap distances between the AuNR yolks and the CdS shells were 11.5 and 4.4 nm, and the average thicknesses of the CdS shells were 15.8 and 12.5 nm in the side and tip regions of the AuNR yolks, respectively. The HAADF-STEM-EDS elemental mapping images of the AuNR-CdS YSNs (Fig. 2m) and the cross-sectional compositional line profiles across a single AuNR-CdS YSN (Fig. 2n) show the distinct compositional distributions of each constituent element, unequivocally confirming the formation of yolk–shell structures during the cation exchange reaction. The weak Ag signals observed around the AuNR-CdS YSNs indicate that a trace amount of Ag still remained after the cation exchange reaction. The EDS-determined Ag/Au atomic ratio of the AuNR-CdS YSNs was 0.2, which is significantly lower than that of the AuNR@Ag CSNs. The XRD pattern of the AuNR-CdS YSNs exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks of the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure of CdS (Fig. 2o), demonstrating the successful conversion of the Ag2S to CdS via the cation exchange reaction. As the characteristic diffraction peaks associated with Ag2S were not detected in the XRD pattern of the AuNR-CdS YSNs, it can be inferred that the Ag2S outer shells of the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs were completely converted to CdS and that the Ag signals detected in the EDS measurements originated from the remaining Ag in the Ag inner shells, not from the Ag2S outer shells. The formation of voids in the AuNR-CdS YSNs during the cation exchange reaction implies that the outward diffusion of Ag in the Ag inner shells of the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs accompanied the conversion of the Ag2S outer shells to CdS (vide infra).
The evolution of the AuNR-CdS YSNs from the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs was monitored by TEM and EDS measurements on samples taken at different reaction times (Fig. 4). Within 30 min, the voids started to appear in several nanostructures (Fig. 4a). As the reaction time increased, the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs were gradually transformed into AuNR-CdS YSNs (Fig. 4b–e). The changes in the compositions of the samples determined by EDS analysis during the cation exchange reaction distinctly show that the Ag composition of the samples decreased with the increase in the Cd composition over 10 h of reaction time, while the Au composition was maintained throughout the entire period (Fig. 4f). Notably, the rapid changes in the Ag and Cd compositions of the samples were discerned at the early stage of the reaction, indicating the quick progress of the cation exchange reaction, which coincides with the results of the TEM measurements. The almost intact Ag and Cd compositions of the samples after the 10 h reaction indeed corroborate that the conversion process was completed in 10 h.

Mechanistic studies on the formation of AuNR-CdS YSNs
To gain a mechanistic insight into the formation of the AuNR-CdS YSNs, we performed a series of control experiments. On the basis of the experimental results and findings, the existence of Ag inner shells in the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs is assumed to be essential for the formation of voids in the AuNR-CdS YSNs during the cation exchange reaction. To confirm the critical role of the Ag inner shell in the realization of the yolk–shell structure, AuNR@Ag CSNs with much thinner Ag shells (average thickness = 2.8 nm) compared to the AuNR@Ag CSNs used in the synthesis of the AuNR-CdS YSNs were prepared. Then they were subjected to sequential sulfidation and cation exchange reactions under synthesis conditions similar to those employed in the preparation of the AuNR-CdS YSNs (Fig. 5a–c). In stark contrast to the case of typical AuNR@Ag CSNs, the sulfidation reaction of the AuNR@Ag CSNs with thinner Ag shells led to the full conversion of Ag to Ag2S, resulting in the formation of AuNR@Ag2S CSNs without Ag inner shells (Fig. 5d–f). XPS depth-profiling of the composition of the AuNR@Ag2S CSNs showed that both the Ag and S compositions gradually decreased, while the Au composition increased, as the sputtering time increased, further revealing their core–shell structure (Fig. 3b). The subsequent cation exchange reaction of the AuNR@Ag2S CSNs yielded AuNR@CdS CSNs instead of AuNR@CdS YSNs (Fig. 5g–i). The average thicknesses of the CdS shells of the AuNR@CdS CSNs were 10.1 and 9.4 nm at the sides and tips of the AuNR cores, respectively. These results explicitly indicate that the Ag inner shells of the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs originating from the partial conversion of the Ag shells of the AuNR@Ag CSNs are indispensable to the production of AuNR-CdS YSNs.

AuNR-CdS YSNs were generated by the cation exchange reaction of AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs with Cd(NO3)2 in methanol in the presence of TBP. In fact, TBP can provide the thermodynamic driving force for the cation exchange reaction according to the hard–soft acid–base theory.37–40 As TBP, a soft base, strongly binds Ag+, a soft acid, it can facilitate the exchange of Ag+ with Cd2+. Notably, when a cation exchange reaction was performed in the absence of TBP, while other reaction conditions were kept the same as in the typical synthesis of AuNR-CdS YSNs, the conversion from Ag2S to CdS was rarely observed in the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs (Fig. S3†). On the other hand, when methanol solvent was replaced by water under otherwise identical synthesis conditions to those employed in the preparation of AuNR-CdS YSNs, the transformation of the Ag2S outer shell in the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs into CdS along with the formation of voids was evidenced by HAADF-STEM and XRD measurements (Fig. S4†). However, the use of methanol as a solvent is necessary due to the low solubility of TBP as well as the aggregation of nanostructures during the cation exchange reaction in water (Fig. S5†).39
For the realization of the AuNR-CdS YSNs, TBP is also supposed to be crucial to the formation of voids as well as to the facilitation of the cation exchange. It has been reported that phosphine compounds can readily oxidatively etch Ag atoms in nanostructures through the formation of (PH3)xAg+ complexes, thus promoting the removal of Ag.41–43 For instance, bis(p-sulfonatophenyl)phenylphosphine was used to remove Ag atoms from Ag@M1 (M1 = Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, Os, Ir, PtRu, PtRh, PtOs, PtRuOs, or PtRhOs) core–shell NPs and M2@Ag@M3 (M2 = Au or Pt; M3 = Ru, Os, Ir, Pt, or PtRh) core–shell–shell NPs, and hence for the production of hollow and yolk–shell NPs, respectively.41 In this context, it can be posited that TBP can drive the outward diffusion of Ag in the Ag inner shells of AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs through the oxidative etching of Ag, yielding voids in AuNR-CdS YSNs. Ag+ ions released from the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs through the oxidative etching as well as the cation exchange processes were verified by re-reducing the Ag+ ions in the reaction mixture.41 Apparently, upon the addition of NaBH4 as a reducing agent to the reaction mixture after the cation exchange reaction, tangled nanowires consisting of Ag and Cd with an Ag:Cd atomic ratio of 1:6.9 were formed from the reduction of the released Ag+ ions and the remaining Cd precursors in the reaction mixture (Fig. S6†).
To explore the exclusive role of TBP in the formation of voids in AuNR-CdS YSNs, the prepared AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs were stored in a methanol solution of TBP without Cd(NO3)2 for 24 h. The amount of TBP was identical to that used in the standard synthesis of AuNR-CdS YSNs. Notably, the outward diffusion of the inner Ag domain in the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs was considerably suppressed compared to that in the standard synthesis, though the resultant AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs showed rounded edges (Fig. S7†). This unambiguously corroborates that not only TBP, but also the cation exchange process is probably involved in the outward diffusion of the Ag in the Ag inner shells of AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs to enable the formation of the yolk–shell nanostructures. It can be reasoned that some pathways for the oxidative etching and outward diffusion of the Ag, such as defects, are likely opened at the outer shell of AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs during the cation exchange reaction. As the diffusion coefficient of Ag+, 1.7 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 at 298 K,44 is much higher than that of Cd2+, 7.1 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 at 298 K,45 Ag+ ions can indeed efficiently diffuse outward during the cation exchange reaction through the evolving outer shell of AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs. Taken together, we can conclude that AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs are forced to develop yolk–shell nanostructures during the cation exchange reaction accompanied by oxidative etching and outward diffusion of the Ag inner shell, which are caused by TBP.
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
To examine the synergism between multiple photon reflections provided by the yolk–shell structure and the plasmonic function of the yolks for the promotion of light harvesting efficiency, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of the prepared AuNR-CdS YSNs was investigated and the results were benchmarked against those of CdS HNPs, AuNR@CdS CSNs, and pristine AuNRs. As previously mentioned, AuNR@CdS CSNs could be prepared with AuNR@Ag CSNs with an Ag shell thickness of 2.8 nm (Fig. 5). CdS HNPs with distinct hollow interiors were prepared by sulfidation and the subsequent cation exchange reaction of Ag NPs (Fig. S8a–c†). See the Experimental section for synthesis details. The atom% of Ag in the CdS HNPs obtained by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was 15.7%, which is close to the relative amount of Ag to CdS in the AuNR-CdS YSNs, i.e., 13.8%. The XRD pattern of the CdS HNPs exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks associated with hcp-CdS as well as face-centered cubic Ag (Fig. S8d†). The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was conducted under visible light (λ > 400 nm) irradiation with a 300 W Xe lamp (power density = 150 mW cm−2) in an aqueous solution containing Na2S (0.25 M) and Na2SO3 (0.35 M), which can act as hole scavengers.46,47 When electron–hole pairs are generated upon the photoexcitation of CdS, electrons in the conduction band reduce water to form hydrogen, and holes in the valence band oxidize S2− and SO32−, which can suppress the photo-corrosion of CdS.46
The amounts of hydrogen that evolved during photocatalysis with the different catalysts, which were normalized to the total mass of the catalysts, are shown in Fig. 6a. The corresponding hydrogen evolution rates are summarized in Fig. 6b. Notably, 1.69 mmol g−1 of hydrogen was generated over 3 h (hydrogen evolution rate = 0.563 mmol g−1 h−1) by using AuNR-CdS YSNs as photocatalysts, which is 11.9- and 27.2-fold larger than those obtained with the CdS HNPs and AuNR@CdS CSNs, respectively. Hydrogen evolution was not observed with the pristine AuNRs, revealing that the CdS domains of heteronanostructures indeed act as photocatalysts, not AuNRs. In this context, the hydrogen evolution rates of the different catalysts with respect to the mass of CdS in the catalysts are also displayed in Fig. S9.† These further demonstrate the highly promoted photocatalytic activity of the AuNR-CdS YSNs. From the XPS measurements on the S 2p core-level of the catalysts before and after the 3 h photocatalysis, we found that 8.41, 13.07, and 14.81% of sulfide in the AuNR-CdS YSNs, CdS HNPs, and AuNR@CdS CSNs, respectively, was converted to sulfate after the photocatalysis due to the photo-corrosion of CdS (Fig. S10†).

(c) Comparison of hydrogen evolution activity between AuNR@SiO2@CdS CSSNs and AuNR@CdS CSNs. (d) Comparison of hydrogen evolution activity between AuNR-CdS and AuNR@SiO2-CdS YSNs. 
Interestingly, in stark contrast to the case of the yolk–shell structures, i.e., the AuNR-CdS YSNs, which showed the promotional effect of plasmonic AuNRs on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, the AuNR@CdS CSNs with intimate coupling between AuNRs and CdS exhibited lower photocatalytic activity compared to the CdS HNPs despite the presence of plasmonic AuNR cores (Fig. 6a, b and S9†). Considering the fact that Au possesses a lower Fermi energy level (+0.5 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) than the conduction band of CdS (−1.0 V vs. NHE),48 the inferior photocatalytic activity of the AuNR@CdS CSNs might be attributed to the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CdS shells to the AuNR cores, namely, electron sinking, which reduces the amount of electrons at the catalytic CdS surfaces and thus deteriorates the photocatalytic performance.48,49 To verify the detrimental effect of the charge transfer from the CdS shells to the AuNR cores in the AuNR@CdS CSNs on photocatalysis, we prepared AuNR@SiO2@CdS CSSNs containing 4–5 nm insulating SiO2 layers between the AuNR and CdS domains of the AuNR@CdS CSNs by using AuNR@SiO2 CSNs instead of AuNRs as starting materials (Fig. 7, see the Experimental section for synthesis details), and we tested their photocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution for 3 h (Fig. 6c). The average CdS shell thicknesses of the AuNR@SiO2@CdS CSSNs were 12.3 and 10.0 nm in the side and tip regions of the AuNR cores, respectively, which are comparable to those of the AuNR@CdS CSNs. Notably, the AuNR@SiO2@CdS CSSNs exhibited 3.89-fold improved hydrogen evolution activity compared to the AuNR@CdS CSNs due to the blocking of the charge transfer between the CdS shells and the AuNR cores by the intervening SiO2 layers.

(c) HAADF-STEM image, (d) EDS elemental mapping images, (e) EDS cross-sectional compositional line profiles, and (f) XRD pattern of AuNR@SiO2@CdS CSSNs. A broad feature at the low 2θ side of the XRD pattern is attributed to the SiO2 layer. 
To further explore the behavior of photogenerated charge carriers of the catalysts during photocatalysis, photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed for the AuNR-CdS YSNs, CdS HNPs, and AuNR@CdS CSNs with 375 nm excitation (Fig. S11†). The steady-state PL spectrum of each catalyst showed an emission band at around 480 nm that can be assigned to the band edge emission of CdS (Fig. S11a†).50,51 Notably, the quenching of PL emission was observed for the AuNR-CdS YSNs and AuNR@CdS CSNs in comparison to the CdS HNPs, which is typical for noble metal-incorporated semiconductor photocatalysts.52,53 Time-resolved PL decay of the catalysts (Fig. S11b†) and the corresponding PL lifetimes (Table S1†), which were determined by fitting the PL decay curves with a triple exponential function, distinctly demonstrate that the AuNR-CdS YSNs have the longest charge carrier lifetime among the catalysts, which is in good accordance with their highly pronounced photocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the PL intensity of the AuNR@CdS CSNs decayed faster in comparison to the CdS HNPs, suggesting the fast electron transfer from the photoexcited CdS shells to the AuNR cores in the AuNR@CdS CSNs.53,54
The results of the photocatalytic experiments substantiate the importance of the yolk–shell structure for the promotion of the light harvesting efficiency of plasmonic metal–semiconductor heteronanostructures. In addition, the results of repeated photocatalytic runs with the AuNR-CdS YSNs further showed their recyclability in the hydrogen evolution reaction (Fig. S12†).
Promotional effect of AuNRs on photocatalysis
To identify the exact role of AuNR yolks in the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of AuNR-CdS YSNs, the possibility of a photothermal effect due to the plasmonic excitation of AuNRs was first considered.55–58 In this regard, changes in the temperature of the reaction mixtures containing the different catalysts, i.e., the AuNR-CdS YSNs, CdS HNPs, AuNR@CdS CSNs, and AuNRs, were monitored under visible light irradiation over 3 h (Fig. S13†). Notably, all the reaction mixtures showed similar temperature variations. In conjunction with the lack of hydrogen evolution activity with the AuNRs, this indicates that plasmonic heating had a negligible influence on the improvement in photocatalytic performance.
As previously mentioned, the plasmonic excitation of metal domains in metal–semiconductor heteronanostructures can increase the charge carrier density in semiconductors and hence promote the photocatalytic activity by plasmon energy transfer from the metal to the semiconductor along several possible pathways, including the radiative relaxation of SPR, HET, and PIRET.29–33 Among the possible routes for plasmon energy transfer, HET is presumed to be inefficient for the improvement of the photocatalytic activity of AuNR-CdS YSNs because intimate contact between the metal and semiconductor domains is indispensable for this process.36,59–63 To corroborate this inference, AuNR@SiO2-CdS YSNs consisting of the AuNR@SiO2 CSN yolks, which were used in the synthesis of AuNR@SiO2@CdS CSSNs, and CdS shells were prepared (Fig. 8, see the Experimental section for synthesis details), and their photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity was compared with that of the AuNR-CdS YSNs, which have no insulating SiO2 layers on the AuNR yolk surfaces (Fig. 6d). The average CdS shell thicknesses of the AuNR@SiO2-CdS YSNs were 14.4 and 12.5 nm in the side and tip regions of the AuNR@SiO2 CSN yolks, respectively, which are very comparable to those of the AuNR-CdS YSNs. Interestingly, the incorporation of insulating SiO2 layers onto the surfaces of the AuNR yolks did not lead to a significant decrease in the hydrogen evolution activity. The average amount of hydrogen that evolved during the 3 h photocatalysis with the AuNR@SiO2-CdS YSNs reached 85.4% of that obtained with the AuNR-CdS YSNs. This confirms that the contribution of HET to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity is not dominant. Given that the PIRET process also requires intimate coupling between the metal and the semiconductor domains, as in HET,61–63 its contribution to photocatalysis might be trivial, if any.

Based on the above results and findings, the promotional effect of AuNR yolks in the AuNR-CdS YSNs during photocatalysis can be attributed mostly to the radiative relaxation of the SPR of the AuNRs, such as near-field enhancement and resonant photon scattering. To confirm the suggested mechanism for the promotional effect of AuNRs, the optical properties of the different catalysts were investigated. Fig. 9a shows the diffuse reflectance spectra of the AuNR-CdS YSNs, CdS HNPs, AuNR@CdS CSNs, and AuNRs. The CdS HNPs exhibited an absorption edge at around 526 nm due to their band gap, of which the band gap energy, Eg(CdS), was estimated to be 2.42 eV (512 nm) by using the Tauc plot (Fig. S14†),64 and broad absorption over the wavelength range longer than the absorption edge, which may be due to the presence of residual Ag.65 The AuNRs showed an absorption band around 494 nm, which can be assigned to the typical SPR peak of the AuNRs associated with the transverse dipole plasmon mode, together with a broad absorption band corresponding to the longitudinal dipole plasmon mode in the range of 560–730 nm. The diffuse reflectance spectra of the AuNR-CdS YSNs and the AuNR@CdS CSNs also showed the SPR peaks associated with the transverse mode of the constituent AuNRs at 493 and 498 nm, respectively, while those corresponding to the longitudinal mode of the AuNRs were damped, which might be due to the CdS shells.66 Noticeably, the AuNR-CdS YSNs exhibited significantly enhanced absorption over the entire wavelength range, especially in the band gap absorption region of CdS, compared to the other catalysts, distinctly demonstrating that the unique yolk–shell structure of the AuNR-CdS YSNs can lead to efficient utilization of the incident light. This can be attributed to the synergism between the radiative relaxation of the plasmon energy of the AuNR yolks and the multiple reflections of the incident light within the voids due to the yolk–shell structure, which can boost the light absorption of CdS (see the inset of Fig. 9b).

The band gap absorption region of CdS is denoted by red color. The inset shows the schematic illustration of the synergism between the radiative relaxation of the plasmon energy of the AuNR yolks and the multiple reflections of the incident light within the voids due to the yolk–shell structure, which can boost the light absorption of CdS. 
The proposed mechanism for the promotional effect of the AuNR yolks on the photocatalytic activity of the AuNR-CdS YSNs was further confirmed by the excitation wavelength-dependent hydrogen evolution activity of the AuNR-CdS YSNs, which was obtained under monochromatic light irradiation (Fig. 9b). Evidently, the AuNR-CdS YSNs showed distinct photocatalytic activity only when the incident photon energy was higher than the Eg(CdS). If the HET or PIRET process is the origin of the promotional effect of AuNR yolks on photocatalysis, the activity trend of the AuNR-CdS YSNs along the change in the excitation wavelength will follow the SPR features of AuNRs.61–63 The apparent quantum efficiency of the AuNR-CdS YSNs under 450 nm irradiation was 0.32%. The comparison of the quantum efficiency of the AuNR-CdS YSNs with those of other CdS or CdSe-based photocatalysts is summarized in Table S2.†
Conclusions
We have developed a novel synthesis method for the formation of plasmonic metal–semiconductor hetero-nanoarchitectures with a well-defined yolk–shell structure and identified the underpinning mechanism of their plasmon-enhanced photocatalytic function. The sequential sulfidation and cation exchange reactions of preformed AuNR@Ag CSNs successfully yielded AuNR-CdS YSNs. The partial conversion of the Ag shells of the AuNR@Ag CSNs to Ag2S during the sulfidation reaction to form intermediate AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs and a cation exchange reaction accompanied by oxidative etching and outward diffusion of the Ag inner shells of the AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs, which are caused by TBP, are critical to the realization of the yolk–shell structure. The prepared AuNR-CdS YSNs exhibited remarkably improved photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution relative to CdS HNPs, AuNR@CdS CSNs, and pristine AuNRs due to the synergism between multiple photon reflections provided by the yolk–shell structure and the plasmonic function of AuNR yolks, which can promote light harvesting efficiency. We foresee that the proposed approach will be applied to the production of a new class of metal–semiconductor heteronanostructures with desired configurations and functions, and further enhancement of the photocatalytic function is envisioned through precise control over the structure and plasmonic function of YSNs.

Characterization
TEM and HAADF-STEM-EDS mapping images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-ARM200F Cs-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV and a Philips Tecnai G2 F30 Super-Twin field-emission transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV, after placing a drop of the nanostructure solution on a carbon-coated Cu grid (300 mesh). XRD patterns were obtained with a RIGAKU Ultima IV thin-film X-ray diffractometer and a RIGAKU D/MAX-2500 multi-purpose thin-film X-ray diffractometer. XPS measurements were carried out using a Thermo VG Scientific Sigma Probe spectrometer with Al Kα X-ray (1486.6 eV) as the light source. XPS spectra were calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.4 eV. ICP-OES analyses were conducted with an Agilent 720 ICP-OES. Diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer with an ISR-3100 integrating sphere attachment. PL measurements were carried out with an Edinburgh Instruments FL920 spectrometer.
Photocatalysis
The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions were conducted under visible-light irradiation by using a Xe lamp (300 W, Newport 66902) equipped with a UV-cutoff filter (Kenko L-42, λ > 400 nm). The power density of the light source was 150 mW cm−2. In a typical photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, 3.0 mg of catalysts was dispersed in 4.0 mL of an aqueous solution containing Na2SO3 (0.35 M) and Na2S (0.25 M) in a reaction cell, a quartz cuvette with a volume of 16 mL. The reaction solution was purged with Ar gas for 30 min to establish an anaerobic condition, and then the reaction cell was sealed with a silicone rubber septum. The amount of hydrogen evolved was measured by gas chromatography (GC) using an Agilent 7890A GC system coupled to an Agilent 5975C inert XL MSD with a triple axis detector with a Carboxen 1000 packed column. For the photocatalysis under monochromatic light irradiation, 10.0 mg of catalysts was dispersed in 10.0 mL of an aqueous solution containing Na2SO3 (0.35 M) and Na2S (0.25 M) in a reaction cell, a quartz cuvette with a volume of 100 mL. The power density of the light source was 5 mW cm−2 and the excitation wavelength was modulated by using band pass filters with center wavelengths of 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, and 700 ± 2 nm (full width at half maximum = 10 ± 2 nm).

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustrating the synthesis route of AuNR-CdS YSNs. TEM images of (b) AuNRs, (c) AuNR@Ag CSNs, (d) AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs, and (e) AuNR-CdS YSNs.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a, f, and k) TEM, (b, g, and l) HAADF-STEM, and (c, h, and m) the corresponding EDS elemental mapping images, (d, i, and n) EDS cross-sectional compositional line profiles and (e, j, and o) XRD patterns of (a–e) AuNR@Ag CSNs, (f–j) AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs, and (k–o) AuNR-CdS YSNs. The positions of Au, Ag, Ag2S, and CdS references in XRD patterns were taken from the JCPDS database (Au: 65-2870, Ag: 04-0783, Ag2S: 14-0072, and CdS: 41-1049).	 

 	Fig. 3  Atomic concentrations of S, Ag, and Au of (a) AuNR@Ag@Ag2S CSSNs and (b) AuNR@Ag2S CSNs as a function of sputtering time obtained by XPS.	 

 	Fig. 4  TEM images of samples obtained at different cation exchange reaction times: (a) 0.5, (b) 1, (c) 3, (d) 10, and (e) 24 h. (f) Compositional changes of the samples determined by EDS analysis during the cation exchange reaction.	 

 	Fig. 5  TEM images of (a) AuNR@Ag CSNs with an Ag shell thickness of 2.8 nm, (b) AuNR@Ag2S CSNs, and (c) AuNR@CdS CSNs. (d) TEM, HAADF-STEM, and the corresponding EDS elemental mapping images, (e) cross-sectional compositional line profiles, and (f) XRD pattern of AuNR@Ag2S CSNs. (g) TEM, HAADF-STEM, and the corresponding EDS elemental mapping images, (h) cross-sectional compositional line profiles, and (i) XRD pattern of AuNR@CdS CSNs.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Amounts of hydrogen evolved during the photocatalysis with different catalysts, which are normalized to the total mass of the catalysts and (b) the corresponding hydrogen evolution rates. (c) Comparison of hydrogen evolution activity between AuNR@SiO2@CdS CSSNs and AuNR@CdS CSNs. (d) Comparison of hydrogen evolution activity between AuNR-CdS and AuNR@SiO2-CdS YSNs.	 

 	Fig. 7  TEM images of (a) AuNR@SiO2 CSNs and (b) AuNR@SiO2@CdS CSSNs. High-magnification TEM image of an AuNR@SiO2 CSN with an arrow denoting the SiO2 layer is shown in the inset of (a). (c) HAADF-STEM image, (d) EDS elemental mapping images, (e) EDS cross-sectional compositional line profiles, and (f) XRD pattern of AuNR@SiO2@CdS CSSNs. A broad feature at the low 2θ side of the XRD pattern is attributed to the SiO2 layer.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) TEM, (b) HAADF-STEM, and (c) EDS elemental mapping images, (d) EDS cross-sectional compositional line profiles, and (e) XRD pattern of AuNR@SiO2-CdS YSNs. A broad feature at the low 2θ side of the XRD pattern is attributed to the SiO2 layer.	 

 	Fig. 9  (a) Diffuse reflectance spectra of AuNR-CdS YSNs, CdS HNPs, AuNR@CdS CSNs, and AuNRs. (b) Hydrogen evolution activity of AuNR-CdS YSNs as a function of excitation wavelength. The band gap absorption region of CdS is denoted by red color. The inset shows the schematic illustration of the synergism between the radiative relaxation of the plasmon energy of the AuNR yolks and the multiple reflections of the incident light within the voids due to the yolk–shell structure, which can boost the light absorption of CdS.
