    , Accepted 17th May 2022First published on 18th May 2022AbstractDeveloping ternary organic solar cells has been acknowledged as an effective method to improve the power conversion efficiency compared to the traditional binary counterparts. Therefore, developing low-cost third components is a “two birds one stone” strategy to synchronously realize high-performance ternary devices and reduce the material costs. In this work, a single-thiophene derivative (5E,5′E)-5,5′-(thiophene-2,5-diylbis(methaneylylidene))bis(3-ethylthiazolidine-2,4-dione) (TTZD) is designed and synthesized in a one-step process from low-cost raw materials. By incorporating 3 wt% TTZD into the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blends, ternary devices afforded promoted power conversion efficiency of 10.63%, higher than the 9.53% of the binary control. As investigated, blending appropriate amounts of TTZD negligibly disturbed the binary blend morphologies, but transferred supplemental photon energy to the host blends through the Förster resonance energy transfer process, resulting in enlarged photocurrent.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are regarded as a promising solar energy technology due to their attributes of light weight, solution-processing and large-scale fabrication as well as semitransparent and flexible application prospects. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of OSCs, for instance, judicious molecular engineering of electron donor and acceptor materials, regulation of device structures, interfacial modifications, ternary strategies and morphology optimizations, which have contributed to significant improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) to surpass 20% to date.1–6
Among the aforementioned tactics, incorporating a third component into the host electron donor:acceptor (D:A) blends, as the so-called “ternary strategy”, affords an efficient approach to improving the photovoltaic performance.7,8 Retaining the simplicities of single-junction fabrication, the ternary strategy could provide multiple benefits to enlarge the light-harvesting capacity, facilitate exciton dissociation, provide additional charge transport pathways and modify morphological parameters. Thus, efficient ternary OSCs have been widely reported in recent years, leading to thriving developments in device performance.9–12
It should be noted that the performance of ternary OSCs is sensitive to the properties of the third component, such as the chemical structures, miscibility with the host blends and weight ratios. Moreover, compared to well-regulated D:A blends, ternary blends with additional components would lead to more complicated charge generation and transport processes and unexpected changes in morphology.13,14 Thus, it is complicated to select an appropriate third component. Fortunately, in some of the recent research an “energy transfer” model has been constructed, in which the third component is distributed as a separate phase from the host blends and serves as the “energy donor” to deliver additional photon energy to the “energy acceptor” through the non-radiative Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process.15–17 Through careful design, in this model, blending a certain amount of the third component is expected to induce negligible interference in the original charge transmission and steady morphology. Hence, this strategy affords great convenience for realizing improved PCE using ternary strategies without additional interference with the host blends.
Additionally, from the perspective of cost issues, ternary strategy commonly enhances the material costs in device fabrication. The most widely employed third components, which could also serve as photoactive materials, such as fullerene derivatives,18,19 bulk fused-ring electron donors and acceptors,20–22 as well as conjugated polymers,23–25 generally suffer from lengthy synthesis and complicated purification. In this case, to meet the requirements of commercial and large-scale applications of ternary OSCs, it is ideal to develop low-cost materials to act as guest components to realize cost-effective ternary OSCs.
Motivated by these considerations, in this work, a low-cost single thiophene-derived material, (5E,5′E)-5,5′-(thiophene-2,5-diylbis(methaneylylidene))bis(3-ethylthiazolidine-2,4-dione) (TTZD), was developed and employed as the third component in constructing ternary OSCs. TTZD possessed a simple molecular structure (Fig. 1) and could be facilely synthesized from inexpensive raw materials through a one-step reaction in a high yield of ∼85%. By incorporating a small amount (3%, corresponding to the weight ratio of the host donor) of TTZD into the benchmark D:A blends PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, PCE was improved from 9.53% of the binary control to 10.63% of the ternary devices (PTB7-Th: (poly-[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate]), IEICO-4F: (2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-(((4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(methanylyidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile)). Characterizations revealed that TTZD in ternary blends successfully constructed an ideal “energy transfer” model. TTZD was mostly found to distribute individually to form an isolated phase. The incorporation of a small amount of TTZD demonstrated no interference with the original phase separation of the host blends. Moreover, an efficient FRET process occurred between TTZD and PTB7-Th, in which TTZD could transfer absorbed photon energy to PTB7-Th, resulting in enlarged photocurrent to improve the device efficiency.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and physical properties
The chemical structures of the guest component TTZD and the relevant host D:A materials PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F are shown in Fig. 1. TTZD is composed by a simple electron-donating thiophene core attached with two electron-withdrawing thiazolidine-2,4-dione as terminal groups.26–28 As depicted in Scheme S1 in the ESI,† TTZD was facilely prepared through a one-step Knoevenagel condensation. The chemical structure of TTZD was fully identified through 1H NMR, mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). The molecular geometry calculated from density functional theory (DFT) indicated that TTZD possessed rigid coplanarity with ∼0° dihedral angles between the thiophene core and end groups. In addition, TTZD showed satisfactory thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 328 °C (Fig. S3a, ESI†). Meanwhile, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that TTZD possessed inherently strong crystallization, which was reasonably ascribed to its rigid and planar configuration.29,30 Explicit solid-state thermal transitions were observed from heating and cooling processes, corresponding to prominent endothermic (Tm) and exothermic (Tc) peaks at 272 and 236 °C, respectively (Fig. S3b, ESI†).
As depicted in Fig. 2a, PTB7-Th and IEICO-4F presented wide absorption profiles in the range of 400–800 and 600–1000 nm, respectively. In addition, TTZD showed relatively narrow absorption with a strong peak at 321 nm and a weak intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band in the region of 350–600 nm, suggesting that involving small amounts of TTZD would afford limited contribution to the absorption capacities of ternary blends. Not surprisingly, all the ternary blends demonstrated similar absorbance to the binary control (Fig. 2b). More specifically, the intensities of the absorption peaks located at ∼714 nm in various ternary blends, which belonged to the characteristic absorbance of PTB7-Th, emerged to be slightly lower compared to that of the binary blend. That meant that the involvement of TTZD monotonically weakened the aggregation of PTB7-Th to a certain extent.31–33

(c) Normalized PL spectrum of TTZD excited at 375 nm and the absorption spectrum of the host donor PTB7-Th in the film state. 
Furthermore, the photoluminescence spectrum of TTZD is demonstrated in Fig. 2c. TTZD exhibited a broad emission in the range of 480–800 nm in the film state, which was adequately overlapped with the absorption of PTB7-Th. Hence, TTZD and PTB7-Th could form ideal FRET pairs, where TTZD served as the “energy donor” and transferred the absorbed photon energy to the “energy acceptor” PTB7-Th. In addition, the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of TTZD were calculated to be −5.96 and −3.68 eV, respectively, according to the results of cyclic voltammetry in Fig. S4 (ESI†).
2.2 Photovoltaic performance
To study the effect of TTZD on the performance of OSCs, binary PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F and ternary PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:TTZD devices with various TTZD components (1%, 3% and 5%, corresponding to the weight of PTB7-Th) were fabricated with the structure of ITO/ZnO/Active Layer/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 3a). The blends (PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:TTZD = 1:1.5-x:x, w/w, x represents the blending ratio of TTZD) with a total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 premixed in chlorobenzene solution were spin-coated at 2000 rpm to form ∼90 nm thick active layers. And all the devices were prepared without any solvent additive or post-treatment. Binary solar cells showed an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.73 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.03 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.62, realizing a maximum PCE of 9.53%. The value is well-accordant with the results from the literature.34–38 In addition, progressively enhanced PCE values to 9.85% and 10.63% were obtained from ternary OSCs containing 1% and 3% TTZD, respectively, due to the improved Jsc and FF (Fig. 3b and Table 1). Further increasing the ratio of TTZD, the maximum PCE declined to 8.91%. It should be noted that all the devices exhibited the same Voc values of 0.73 V, indicating that TTZD did not participate in the charge generation process in the active layers. This was a typical phenomenon of ternary OSCs in the “energy transfer” model.15,39–42 For the outperformed ternary OSCs, especially 3% TTZD-containing blends with champion Jsc and FF values of 22.28 mA cm−2 and 0.66, the improved device performance should be synchronously profited from additional photon energy transferred from TTZD to PTB7-Th via FRET and the optimization of carrier dynamics. Moreover, as observed from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, the photoresponse intensities were in accordance with the variation tendencies of the Jsc values for different devices (Fig. 3c).

2.3 Characterization of energy transfer
To further clarify the FRET process between TTZD and PTB7-Th, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of TTZD:PTB7-Th blends with various TTZD composing ratios were detected, as shown in Fig. 3d. Upon blending with the “energy acceptor” PTB7-Th, the strong emission of the “energy donor” TTZD was sufficiently quenched. In addition, progressively enhanced PL intensities in TTZD:PTB7-Th blends were realized by enlarging the weight ratios of TTZD, which originated from the additional photon energy transfer from TTZD to PTB7-Th. Furthermore, binary solar cells comprised of PTB7-Th:3% TTZD and IEICO-4F:3% TTZD were fabricated for comparison with single-component devices with PTB7-Th, IEICO-4F or TTZD as active layers. As summarized in Table 1, the higher Jsc of 0.57 mA cm−2 from PTB7-Th:3% TTZD confirmed the energy transfer between TTZD and PTB7-Th. In comparison, the other devices showed negligible photocurrent. The results were also in accordance with the photovoltaic parameters of ternary devices.
2.4 Carrier dynamics
Characterization on carrier dynamics was conducted to unveil the variations in Jsc and FF of different OSCs. First, curves of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective applied voltage (Veff) were analyzed to compare the exciton dissociation probability (P(E,T)). As shown in Fig. 3e, ternary devices containing 1%, 3% and 5% TTZD afforded enlarged P(E,T) values of 0.920, 0.983 and 0.882, respectively, compared to 0.874 from the binary control. In addition, determined from Jsat, the maximum exciton generation rates (Gmax) for binary and ternary blends with 1%, 3% and 5% of TTZD were calculated as 1.24, 1.40, 1.42 and 1.31 × 1028 m−3 s−1, respectively. Furthermore, determined from the power-law dependence of Jsc upon various light intensities (Plight), the exponential factor α values were fitted to be 0.922, 1.009, 1.008 and 0.988 for devices involving 0%, 1%, 3% and 5% TTZD, respectively (Fig. 3f). As a result, incorporating TTZD was conducive to facilitating exciton dissociation and suppressing bimolecular charge recombination in the ternary blends. Furthermore, the enhanced Gmax confirmed that, even though incorporating a small amount of TTZD makes no contribution to the light-harvesting capacities of the ternary blends, the ternary OSCs could still produce more excitons by utilizing the additional photon energy delivered from TTZD to PTB7-Th through FRET. It is noted that the devices based on 3% TTZD demonstrated the highest exciton dissociation probability, and best exciton generation rates and least bimolecular recombination, which is in agreement with the highest PCE values.
Subsequently, the charge transportation in different blends was characterized through the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The fitted J–V curves for hole- and electron-only devices are depicted in Fig. S5 (ESI†). As summarized in Table 2, the hole mobilities (μh) emerged to be slightly higher in ternary blends when involving 1% TTZD, with a value of 9.61 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to 8.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 of the binary control. However, further incorporation of more TTZD led to diminished μh of 6.38 × 10−4 and 7.12 × 10−4 in the ternary blends containing 3% and 5% TTZD, respectively. The decreased μh possibly originated from the aforementioned weakened aggregation of PTB7-Th in ternary blends. In contrast, compared to the electron mobility (μe) of 1.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 from the binary blends, all the ternary blends showed higher μe values of 4.40 × 10−4, 4.92 × 10−4, and 4.03 × 10−4 upon incorporation of 1%, 3% and 5% TTZD, respectively. Thus, a more balanced charge transportation (μh/μe) was realized by involving TTZD, particularly for the 3% TTZD system, which revealed its superior Jsc and FF.

2.5 Morphologies
The location of the third component in the active layer determines the working mechanism of the ternary OSCs and has a strong influence on the blend morphologies. Herein, contact angle measurements were conducted to locate the distribution of TTZD in ternary blends. From contact angle values of distilled water and diiodomethane upon different neat films, the surface free energies of PTB7-Th, IEICO-4F and TTZD were calculated to be 33.76, 40.06 and 46.86 mN m−1, according to the Owens–Wendt model43,44 (eqn (1)): (1)where γd and γp represent the dispersion and polar components of the surface energy, and the subscripts L and S refer to the probe liquid and film sample, respectively. The detailed results of dispersion and polar components of the surface energies are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Furthermore, based on these results, the interfacial surface energies between different photoactive components in the active layer blends were estimated by using the interfacial tension equation15,45,46 (eqn (2)): (2)where β = 0.000115 m2 mN−2 and γA—B is the interfacial surface energy between A and B. A low γA—B value means good miscibility between A and B. Conversely, two components tend to form more separated phases when γA—B is estimated to be larger. By calculation, the γPTB7-Th—IEICO-4F, γIEICO-4F—TTZD and γPTB7-Th—TTZD were 0.64, 0.73 and 2.66 mN m−1, respectively. Hence, the host blends of PTB7-Th and IEICO-4F tended to form well-mixed phases. In contrast, as depicted in Fig. 4b, TTZD with a much higher surface free energy and larger interfacial surface energies with the host materials was more likely to distribute in amorphous regions as individual phases, which were potentially parallel to the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F domains.16,47–49

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted to trace the variations in the morphologies of ternary blends. For ternary blends incorporated with 1% and 3% TTZD, the surface morphologies were nearly identical to the binary control, indicating that the exiguous and relatively isolated TTZD domains had negligible influence on the phase separation and domain sizes of the host blends. Upon further increasing the weight ratio to 5%, the worm-like domains which originated from PTB7-Th aggregation became less salient. The phenomena were accordant with the results from UV-vis spectra, which partially illustrated the inferior photovoltaic performance of the corresponding devices.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a low-cost thiophene derivative TTZD has been developed to be employed as the third component to construct ternary OSCs. In the ternary blends, TTZD could transfer absorbed photon energy to the host donor PTB7-Th through the efficient FRET process, thus improving the Jsc of the ternary OSCs. Moreover, due to the rigid conformation and high surface free energy, TTZD tended to be distributed in a relatively isolated way. Thus, incorporating a suitably small amount of TTZD showed no disadvantage in the well-regulated morphology of the host blends. In addition to the FRET process, favorable carrier dynamics in ternary blends, including suppressed charge combination, facilitated exciton generation and dissociation as well as a more balanced charge transport, simultaneously contributed to promoting the photovoltaic performance. As a result, ternary OSCs incorporating 3% TTZD demonstrated improved PCE and Jsc of 10.63% and 22.28 mA cm−2 compared to the binary counterpart (9.53% and 21.03 mA cm−2). Our work revealed the benefits and promising prospects of low-cost third component in improving the photovoltaic performance in ternary OSCs.
