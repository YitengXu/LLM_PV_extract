    , Accepted 20th March 2023First published on 31st March 2023AbstractSolar absorbers, which harvest solar irradiation in the form of heat, have promising prospects in electricity, heating, desalination, and energy storage. However, in previous work, absorbers are usually designed as nanostructures involving photolithography to obtain a superior spectral absorption performance, which inevitably increases the cost and complexity of fabrication. Here, we propose a pattern-free absorber consisting of the TiN–SiO2-based multilayer structure for effective solar energy utilization. Numerical results show that the maximum average spectral absorption of a 3-cell multilayer structure is up to 93.5% at wavelengths of 0.3–2.5 μm. The underlying physical mechanism can be explained by the coupling of superposed Fabry–Perot (FP) resonances and the intrinsic absorption of TiN, which is further confirmed via the electric field and power dissipation density distributions. The effect of the geometric parameters and materials of multilayer structures on the spectral absorption performance is investigated. Moreover, we discuss the influence of the incidence angle on solar absorbers and demonstrate that an average spectral absorption of more than 80% can be obtained even at a large incidence angle of 60°. Finally, when the number of cells in the multilayer structure is increased to 6, the average spectral absorption can reach 96%. The findings in this work will deepen the understanding of FP resonance and pave a novel path for efficient solar thermal energy utilization.
1. Introduction
Energy problems are a key constraint on economic and social development.1 It is estimated that oil and natural gas will be depleted in the next 40–60 years, and coal mining will last only another 200 years.2 In addition, burning fossil fuels can cause serious environmental pollution problems via the greenhouse effect and acid rain.3 Solar energy, as a representative of a clean, widely distributed renewable energy that is available in large reserves, occupies a dominant position in the world's energy system.4–6 In solar thermal utilization, harvesting solar irradiation is one of the most critical and essential parts. Due to their ability to effectively absorb solar radiation energy, solar absorbers have been widely studied in recent years.7,8 In particular, noble metals (Ag, Au) are considered to be ideal absorbing materials because of their plasma resonance and optical coupling properties, although their narrow absorption spectra and high costs have become the main limitation to their application.9 In addition, concentrated photovoltaics is the current mainstream technology, which reduces the cost of power generation and effectively improves the conversion efficiency of thermophotovoltaic systems by converging solar irradiation with low heat flux density on the surface of photovoltaic cells. However, such a huge radiative heat flux will cause the system temperature to rise rapidly to over 1000 K, which requires the absorber material to have high-temperature resistance properties.
Metamaterials, which manifest exotic optical properties that are not possessed by natural materials, are an effective way to enhance the absorption.10–24 So far, numerous efforts have been devoted to designing metamaterial solar absorbers for effectively harvesting solar irradiation.25–33 For instance, Yu et al. designed an ultra-broadband solar absorber based on refractory titanium with a better performance.9 Based on surface plasmon resonance, the absorber showed an average absorption of 92.7% in the studied absorption spectrum (166.8–1926.6 nm). Wu et al. proposed a broadband wide-angle solar absorber consisting of an iron square ring array and a dielectric film.34 The absorber achieved an average absorption of about 98% in the spectral range of 380–2000 nm due to plasma resonance. Patel et al. proposed a complementary circular array of solar absorbers using the noble metal Au, which achieved an average absorption of 89% in the visible range.35 Lei et al. proposed a broadband absorber based on a periodic array consisting of Ti–SiO2 cubes and an Al substrate film.36 The proposed structure can achieve almost perfect absorption, at 97% on average over a wide range from 354 nm to 1066 nm. The above-proposed absorbers all exhibit a superior solar energy absorption performance. However, in addition to using noble metals, these absorber structures need to be fabricated using a photolithography process, which undoubtedly increases the manufacturing cost and complexity.
Multilayer structures have attracted significant attention in the past few years because of the advantages of simple structures and enhanced absorption.37–43 It has been demonstrated that most previous studies into structures have focused on narrowband absorption.44–47 Recently, Xie et al. proposed a stacked Fabry–Perot (FP) multilayer structure for spacecraft thermal control that achieves a highly enhanced infrared emittance as well as emittance tunability.48 However, whether or not this structure can be applied to solar absorber designs remains to be investigated, and the deep physical mechanism deserves further exploration.
In this work, we propose a superposed FP multilayer structure for harvesting solar energy effectively. High-melting-point materials (TiN and SiO2) are used to meet the high-temperature requirements of the solar absorber. The transfer matrix method (TMM) is applied to calculate the absorption of the multilayer structure.49 Due to the coupling of superposed FP resonances and the intrinsic absorption of TiN, the average spectral absorption of the 3-cell multilayer structure can exceed 90% at wavelengths of 0.3–2.5 μm. Moreover, we investigate the effects of the geometric parameters, materials, and the number of cells on the spectral absorption performance of multilayer structures. The influence of the incidence angle on the solar absorber for transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarization are also discussed.
2. Models and methods
To begin, the schematic diagram of the proposed pattern-free solar absorber is shown in Fig. 1. The FP multilayer structure consists of three thin film mirrors, three highly transparent dielectric layers in the solar irradiation band, and a reflective substrate. The high-melting-point materials TiN (2950 °C) and SiO2 (1723 °C) are used for the reflective and transparent layers, which provide the absorber with better thermal stability in high-temperature solar-thermal-energy utilization situations. In addition, compared with noble metals such as Au and Ag, these two materials are cheaper, further reducing the manufacturing cost of the solar absorber. The thicknesses of the three TiN layers from top to bottom are d1, d2, and d3. The thickness of the SiO2 layer is h, and the incidence angle is θ. Note that the default conditions are the incidence angle θ = 0 and TM polarization unless otherwise specified. The x–z coordinate system is established with the upper surface of the absorber as the basis, where the z-axis is oriented vertically to the surface.

The spectral absorption of the FP multilayer structure is calculated using the TMM. To compare the optical properties of TiN and SiO2, we give the refractive index and extinction coefficient at wavelengths of 0.3–2.5 μm (as shown in Fig. 2), which can be obtained from the Handbook of Optical Constants of Solids.50 Generally, the amplitude and width of the FP resonance can be adjusted by the thickness of the thin film mirror.51,52 The resonance wavelength depends on the thickness of the transparent layer, which can be predicted using the following equation:53 (1)where n is the refractive index of the transparent layer, and k is an odd integer. The target band for solar energy harvesting is 0.3–2.5 μm. Furthermore, we assume that the FP resonance wavelength is 1 μm, and the refractive index of SiO2 obtained at this wavelength is 1.45. Thus, we can obtain the thickness of the transparent layer as 0.172 μm when k = 1. Note that eqn (1) is only an estimate of the FP resonance wavelength, enabling the thickness of the transparent layer to be limited in a suitable range. To obtain the optimal average spectral absorption, we limit the thickness of each layer to a specific range for optimization: 1–50 nm for the reflective layers and 0.1–0.3 μm for the transparent layer. Taking the average spectral absorption in the range of 0.3–2.5 μm as the optimization target, we can obtain the optimized structural parameters as d1 = 1 nm, d2 = 5 nm, d3 = 9 nm, and h = 0.17 μm. The maximum average spectral absorption is 0.935.

3. Results and discussion
To clarify the mechanism of high absorption in the FP multilayer structure, we first consider the simplified 1-cell structure, which consists of the third TiN layer (9 nm), the transparent layer (0.17 μm), and the substrate in Fig. 1. In addition, we also considered the case of bulk TiN to show the contribution of the substrate to the absorption. Fig. 3 exhibits the spectral absorption of the 1-cell structure and bulk TiN at wavelengths of 0.3–2.5 μm. For the 1-cell structure, there are two peak wavelengths of 0.39 μm and 0.87 μm. However, only one absorption peak at the wavelength of 0.41 μm is seen for bulk TiN. Therefore, we consider that the absorption peak at the short wavelength can be attributed to the intrinsic absorption of TiN, while the FP resonance causes the absorption peak at the longer wavelength.
 Fig. 3  Spectral absorption of the 1-cell structure (red) and bulk TiN (blue) at wavelengths of 0.3–2.5 μm, where the insets show schematics of the two structures. The peak wavelengths of the 1-cell structure are 0.39 μm and 0.87 μm. 
Moreover, we calculated the electric field distributions of the 1-cell structure at the peak wavelengths of 0.39 μm and 0.87 μm, as shown in Fig. 4. For the peak wavelength of 0.39 μm, the strong electric field is mainly distributed near the reflective layer and the substrate, while it is smaller in the middle of the transparent layer, which indicates that the absorption at this wavelength is mainly related to the intrinsic properties of TiN. For the peak wavelength of 0.87 μm, the strong electric field is mainly distributed in the reflective and transparent layers, which indicates that the light is finally localized inside the absorber via multiple reflections in the FP cavity. To clarify the actual absorption location of the 1-cell structure, we calculated the normalized power dissipation density distributions of the 1-cell structure at peak wavelengths of 0.39 μm and 0.87 μm, as shown in Fig. 5. The power dissipation density distribution in this work is depicted using54,55 (2)where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε′′ is the imaginary permittivity of the material, ω is the angular frequency, and E is the amplitude of the electric field. It can be seen that the TiN layer shows the maximum energy density at the peak wavelength of 0.87 μm, which further confirms that the main absorption contribution at this wavelength is the FP resonance. Fig. 6 compares the actual absorption of each layer, i.e., TiN, SiO2, and the substrate. At short wavelengths, the absorption of the multilayer structure is determined by both the TiN layer and the substrate, which is related to the inherent properties of TiN. As the wavelength increases, the FP resonance will dominate the spectral absorption, so the TiN layer mainly absorbs the energy. It is worth noting that the SiO2 layer shows almost no absorption due to the small imaginary part of the dielectric constant of SiO2.

The impedance matching method is an effective tool for analyzing absorption performance. When the absorber impedance is equal to the impedance in free space (Z = Z0 = 1), it is considered to have achieved perfect absorption at this wavelength. In general, the impedance is described as:56,57 (3)where S11 and S21 are the reflection and transmission coefficients, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the real and imaginary parts of the impedance of bulk TiN. It can be seen that the impedance of bulk TiN is closest to the free space impedance Z0 at the peak wavelength of 0.41 μm. Therefore, bulk TiN has the largest spectral absorption at this wavelength.

After a detailed analysis of the spectral absorption of the 1-cell structure, we return to the study of the 3-cell structure. Fig. 8 shows the spectral absorption of the 3-cell structure at wavelengths of 0.3–2.5 μm. The average spectral absorption is up to 0.935. It can be seen that, despite the 3-cell configuration being used, there is still an absorption valley near 0.54 μm due to the inherent loss of TiN. Three absorption peaks exist at short wavelengths, corresponding to 0.3 μm (0.995), 0.36 μm (0.994), and 0.44 μm (0.998). Similarly, there are three absorption peaks at 0.65 μm (0.975), 0.96 μm (0.999), and 1.7 μm (0.999) in the long wavelength region. Referring to the analysis of the 1-cell structure, we calculated the electric field distribution at the wavelengths of 0.36 μm, and 0.96 μm, as shown in Fig. 9. When the wavelength is 0.36 μm, it can be seen that most of the strong electric fields are distributed in the vicinity of the TiN layer and the substrate. However, the strong electric field is mainly concentrated near the first, and third TiN layers at the wavelength of 0.96 μm. Fig. 10 shows the normalized power dissipation density distributions of the 3-cell structure at the peak wavelengths of 0.36 μm and 0.96 μm. We find that the first TiN layer has the largest energy density and the second TiN layer has the lowest energy density among the three reflective layers. Furthermore, we calculated the spectral absorption of the 3-cell structure, the first TiN layer, second TiN layer, third TiN layer, SiO2 layer, and substrate, as shown in Fig. 11. When the wavelength is small, the absorption of the multilayer structure is determined by both the reflective layer and the substrate, where the substrate absorbs most of the energy. For the peak of 0.96 μm, the high absorption of the multilayer structure is mainly caused by the third TiN layer. The second TiN layer contributes more to the absorption for the peaks of 0.65 μm and 1.7 μm. Therefore, we can conclude that the high absorption performance of the structure in the solar irradiation band is due to the superposed FP resonance caused by multiple FP cavities.

Furthermore, we discuss the effect of the geometric parameters of the 3-cell structure on the spectral absorption performance. Fig. 12(a–c) shows the cases of first, second, and third TiN layers. Due to the inherent loss of TiN, the 3-cell structure always has an absorption valley near 0.54 μm. In the short wavelength region, the spectral absorption is less affected by the thickness of the reflective layer. The 3-cell structure remains at a high performance, which the intrinsic absorption of TiN can explain. However, an excessive increase in the thickness of the reflective layer causes the light to be reflected into the air in the long wavelength region, weakening the contribution of the FP resonance and thus decreasing the spectral absorption of the 3-cell structure. This phenomenon is particularly prominent in the first TiN layer. Fig. 12(d) shows the influence of the thickness of the SiO2 layer on the spectral absorption. According to eqn (1), the thickness of the transparent layer is the main factor affecting the FP resonance wavelength. As the thickness increases, the spectral absorption of the 3-cell structure appears to change periodically, and the magnitude of the period is positively correlated with the wavelength. The effect of the reflective layer material on the spectral absorption of the 3-cell structure is also compared, as shown in Fig. 13. The dielectric constants of Ni, W, and Au can be obtained from ref. 50. We find that all four materials exhibit a good absorption performance when the wavelength is less than 0.5 μm. Fig. 13(b) shows the average spectral absorption of the 3-cell structure at wavelengths of 0.3–2.5 μm for the different materials. The average spectral absorptions obtained using the 3-cell structures of TiN, Ni, W, and Au are 93.5%, 91.4%, 80.9%, and 35.2%, respectively, further proving that TiN is a more suitable material for the reflective layer of FP multilayer structures.

In practical solar thermal energy utilization, solar irradiation is mainly divided into TM and TE polarization, and the incidence direction is random. Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect of the incidence angle and the polarization direction on the absorption performance. Fig. 14 shows that the angle of incidence has a small effect on the spectral absorption of the multilayer structure, and only a blue shift of the absorption valley occurs. In addition, we investigated the variation in the average spectral absorption of the 3-cell structure at wavelengths of 0.3–2.5 μm for different incidence angles of TM and TE polarization, as shown in Fig. 15. We find that the average absorption of the 3-cell structure for TM and TE polarization is almost identical when the incidence is normal. It can be seen that the solar absorber maintains an average spectral absorption of 90.7% for TM polarization and 81.7% for TE polarization, even at an incidence angle of 60°.

Moreover, we discuss the effect of the number of cells on the spectral absorption of multilayer FP structures, as shown in Fig. 16. Due to the superposed FP resonance, the number of absorption peaks increases with the number of cells. Note that the layers are not simply superimposed, but optimization calculations obtain the optimal structure after fixing the geometric arrangement of the absorber. It can be seen that the average spectral absorption is positively correlated with the number of cells. When the number of cells is 6, the maximum average spectral absorption can reach 96%. Compared with previous studies, the proposed solar absorber in this work has a simpler structure and superior broadband absorption performance, as shown in Table 1.

It is noteworthy that a larger cell number may further enhance the broadband absorption performance of the solar absorber due to the superimposed FP resonance. However, when the number of cells is greater than 4, increasing the number of cells only results in an average spectral absorption enhancement of <1%, indicating that the enhancement is limited. Moreover, this way will inevitably increase the fabrication cost. Therefore, we did not consider the case of larger cell numbers in this work.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we propose a pattern-free solar absorber, which consists of a TiN–SiO2-based FP structure. The results show that the 3-cell multilayer structure has an average spectral absorption of up to 93.5% at wavelengths of 0.3–2.5 μm. The electric field and power dissipation density distributions were analyzed, which confirms that the potential physical mechanism is the coupling of superposed FP resonances and the intrinsic absorption of TiN. Moreover, we discuss the effects of the geometric parameters, and the solar absorber materials on the spectral absorption performance. We also demonstrate that the proposed absorber still has a superior performance (90.7% for TM polarization and 81.7% for TE polarization) at a large incidence angle of 60°. Finally, we find that by further increasing the number of cells in the multilayer structure to 6, the average spectral absorption can reach 96%. We believe that the findings in this work can have a promising outlook in solar energy harvesting.
