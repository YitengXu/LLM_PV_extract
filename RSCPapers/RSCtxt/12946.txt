    , Accepted 26th July 2018First published on 26th July 2018AbstractDimeric porphyrin molecules have great potential as donor materials for high performance bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs). Recently reported dimeric porphyrins bridged by ethynylenes showed power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of more than 8%. In this study, we design and synthesize a new conjugated dimeric D–A porphyrin ZnP2BT-RH, in which the two porphyrin units are linked by an electron accepting benzothiadiazole (BT) unit. The introduction of the BT unit enhances the electron delocalization, resulting in a lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and an increased molar extinction coefficient in the near-infrared (NIR) region. The bulk heterojunction solar cells with ZnP2BT-RH as the donor material exhibit a high PCE of up to 10% with a low energy loss (Eloss) of only 0.56 eV. The 10% PCE is the highest for porphyrin-based OSCs with a conventional structure, and this Eloss is also the smallest among those reported for small molecule-based OSCs with a PCE higher than 10% to date.
Introduction
In addition to bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) based on polymers,1–8 those based on small molecules (SMs) have also attracted much attention due to their advantages such as defined molecular structures, reproducible synthesis and less batch-to-batch variations in cell performance.9,10 Furthermore, the shorter molecular lengths of SMs result in lower entropic barriers and eliminate the chain entanglements,11 thereby increasing the molecular packing and aggregation in the solid state, which can improve the inter-chain charge transportation. Therefore, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) comparable to those of polymer solar cells have been reported for SM solar cells.12–14
The PCE of a solar cell is determined by its open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF). In order to improve the JSC, one of the strategies is to reduce the bandgap (Eg) of an active material to absorb more light in a broader wavelength range. However, the reduction of Eg is often accompanied by a VOC decrease. The energy loss (Eloss), defined as Eloss = Eg− eVOC, is thus an important parameter in the evaluation of the solar cell performance.15–17 The Eloss values of inorganic crystalline solar cells are typically ∼0.34–0.48 eV and those of efficient perovskite solar cells are also <0.5 eV.18–20 However, most OSCs suffer from high Eloss values of up to 0.7–0.8 eV, and the quantum efficiencies often drop dramatically when Eloss < 0.6 eV.21–24 Therefore, to achieve high PCEs, donor materials with low Eloss values that retain high JSC values are highly desired.
Inspired by photosynthesis which utilizes chlorophylls as strong chromophores, porphyrin analogues have been explored as the active materials for organic solar cells, and PCEs of up to 9% have been achieved recently.25–40 Notably, some porphyrin-based OSCs show low Eloss values with high JSC values. To further increase the JSC values and therefore the PCEs of porphyrin-based OSCs, we developed a series of porphyrin dimers, where porphyrin units were bridged by electron-rich ethynylene, diethynylene, diethynylenedithiophene or diethynylene-phenylene linkers, since extending the molecular conjugation length in oligoporphyrins was reported to be effective in increasing the molar coefficient and extending the absorption wavelength range.41–46 However, the highest PCE was only 8% for dimeric porphyrin-based OSCs.47–49
Considering that alternating electron donor–acceptor (D–A) units in molecular structures can enhance the π electron delocalization and improve the light extinction coefficient due to intramolecular charge transfer,50–54 we incorporate an electron acceptor unit between the two porphyrin units, and design and synthesize an A1–D–A2–D–A1 type dimeric porphyrin ZnP2BT-RH by appending 2-methylene-3-ethylrhodanine (RH) end units (A1) via ethynylene linkages to two porphyrin donor units (D) bridged by another electron acceptor unit (A2) benzothiadiazole (BT) (Scheme 1). ZnP2BT-RH shows an enhanced molar extinction coefficient of the NIR absorption peak, higher than previously reported porphyrin dimers without central electron-withdrawing units. Furthermore, the electron-withdrawing BT unit can down-shift the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (EHOMO), thus increasing the gap between the EHOMO of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level (ELUMO) of PC71BM. A high VOC of 0.845 V, a JSC of 17.66 mA cm−2, a FF of 67.15% and a PCE of up to 10.02% are achieved for the corresponding devices with an Eloss of only 0.56 eV. The 10% PCE is the highest reported for porphyrin-based OSCs with a conventional structure, and the Eloss is also the smallest among the small molecule-based OSCs with a PCE higher than 10% to date.

Experimental section
Materials
All reagents were purchased from commercial sources (Aldrich, Acros, Energy Chemical or Suna Tech Inc.) and used as received. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were dried over Na/benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. Experimental details, 1H NMR, MALDI-TOF and UV-vis-NIR spectra of the molecule, optimal photovoltaic properties, mobility measurements, and AFM, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and GIXD results of pure porphyrin are available in the ESI.†
ZnP2BT-RH
Compound 1 (187 mg, 0.10 mmol) was dissolved in THF (20 mL) and triethylamine (10 mL) with compound 2 (0.30 mmol). Then Pd(PPh3)4 (12 mg, 0.01 mmol) and CuI (2 mg, 0.01 mmol) were added. After the mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 48 h under argon, the reaction was quenched with saturated brine. After the mixture was extracted with chloroform, dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated, the residue was column chromatographed on silica gel using CH2Cl2 as the eluent to give a black solid of ZnP2BT-RH (170 mg, 65% yield).

Results and discussion
The synthesis of the dimeric porphyrin small molecule ZnP2BT-RH is shown in Schemes 1 and S1.† ZnP2BT-RH is a black solid with good thermal stability (SI) and enough solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform (CF), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene, and its chemical structure is confirmed by NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1†) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of light (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Fig. S2†). The ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-vis-NIR) absorption spectrum of ZnP2BT-RH in THF shows two absorption bands (Fig. 1a) at 510 (Soret band) and 761 nm (Q band) with almost the same molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 2.24 × 105 M−1 cm−1 (Fig. S3†). Since the Soret band can be ascribed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone and the Q band in the region of 700–850 nm is attributable to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band,55 the increased ε of the Q band indicates a more efficient ICT in ZnP2BT-RH than that in CS-DP (Scheme 1 and Fig. S3,† the ε of Q band: 1.28 × 105 M−1 cm−1).48

Compared with the absorption spectrum in solution, ZnP2BT-RH films show significantly red-shifted peaks with an onset at 885 nm, from which the optical band gap (Eg(opt)) is calculated to be 1.40 eV. To estimate the EHOMO and ELUMO, we measure the cyclic voltammetry (CV) of ZnP2BT-RH under an inert atmosphere in acetonitrile using tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6, 0.10 M) as the supporting electrolyte, a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. S4,† the onset oxidation potential (Eox) of ZnP2BT-RH is 0.77 V vs. Fc/Fc+, from which the EHOMO is estimated to be −5.17 eV from EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.4) eV, and the ELUMO is −3.77 eV according to ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg(opt). Compared with the EHOMO (−4.96 eV) and ELUMO (−3.74 eV) of CS-DP, the EHOMO is notably reduced while the ELUMO is quite similar.

To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of ZnP2BT-RH-based solar cells, solution-processed BHJ OSCs are fabricated using ZnP2BT-RH as the electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PNDIT-F3N-Br/Al (ITO: indium tin oxide, PEDOT:PSS: poly(styrene sulfonate)-doped poly(ethylene-dioxythiophene), PNDIT-F3N-Br: poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-5,5′-bis(2,2′-thiophene)-2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracaboxylic-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide]dibromide).56 The current density (J)–voltage (V) curves of the ZnP2BT-RH-based OSCs are shown in Fig. 2a, S5 and S6† with the photovoltaic parameters summarized in Tables 2 and S1–S3.† The donor–acceptor weight ratio is optimized to be 1:1.5, and the thickness of the active layer is ∼110 nm. The solar cells based on the as-cast ZnP2BT-RH/PC71BM films show a PCE of 5.23% with a high VOC of 0.91 V. While thermal annealing (TA) of the blend films at 135 °C only slightly improved the efficiency to 5.68%, further chloroform solvent vapor annealing (SVA) (namely TA + SVA) dramatically enhances the efficiency to 9.00% with a slightly reduced VOC of 0.84 V but significantly increased the JSC and FF values of 16.49 mA cm−2 and 63.87%, respectively. Though the FF is smaller than those of CS-DP-based devices (69.80%), this PCE is higher than that of CS-DP-based devices (8.29%) due to the improved JSC and VOC, which can arise from the deeper EHOMO and enhanced ICT in ZnP2BT-RH with the introduction of the electron withdrawing BT unit.

Surprisingly, in contrast to early reported OSCs based on monomeric porphyrins and other small molecules,57–59 the performance of the devices with only SVA is superior to those with TA + SVA. With chloroform SVA for 240 s, the PCE reaches 10.02% with a JSC of 17.66 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.845 V, and a FF of 67.15%. The 10% PCE has been the highest for porphyrin-based OSCs using a conventional structure to date. Furthermore, the efficiencies remain at above 9% for different SVA times from 220 to 280 s. However, further TA after SVA (SVA + TA) reduces the device performance significantly with PCE, JSC and FF values of only 7.60%, 15.79 mA cm−2 and 55.97%, respectively. It is noted that the VOC values still remain high (0.84–0.91 V) while the JSC and FF values change dramatically under the different processing conditions. From the optical bandgap and the VOC values, the Eloss values of the devices are calculated to be 0.49–0.56 eV. The Eloss of 0.56 eV is the smallest for small-molecule OSCs with PCE > 10% (ref. 12–14) and also one of the smallest for organic solar cells with PCE over 9% (Table S4†).1,60–65 One of the reasons why the devices based on ZnP2BT-RH show such low Eloss values can be the relatively high dielectric constant of ZnP2BT-RH (4.07 at 10 kHz) in comparison to those of previously reported porphyrin derivatives DPPEZnP-TEH (3.90 at 10 kHz) and those of other well-known OSC donors (Fig. S7†), since the higher dielectric constant facilitates charge separation and contributes to a lower Eloss.23
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are measured to explore the spectral response of the devices fabricated with the three different post-treatments. As shown in Fig. 2b, the devices convert photons into electrons efficiently over the wavelength range of 300–800 nm, and lower EQEs tailing to 900 nm. While the as-cast devices show EQE peaks at 470 and 800 nm with high EQE values of 61% and 46%, respectively, TA at 135 °C slightly increases the EQE values between 300 and 800 nm with a marginally blue-shifted photo-response. The EQE at ∼790 nm is 50%. In line with the significantly enhanced JSC values, the devices with TA + SVA show improved EQE values from 300 to 900 nm, and the highest EQEs are observed for SVA-only devices with EQEs over 70% between 410 and 540 nm. The calculated JSC from the EQE measurements is 16.92 mA cm−2, which is slightly lower but within 5% error compared to the JSC obtained from the J–V measurements. Further TA (SVA + TA) reduces the photo-to-electric response in the whole wavelength region in comparison to the SVA-only devices. The high EQE values imply a low binding energy of the excitons though the ELUMO difference of ZnP2BT-RH and PC71BM (ΔELUMO) is smaller than the empirical threshold of 0.3 eV (the energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 1b).
To investigate the molecular aggregation behavior, the absorption spectra of the blend films with the different post-treatments are measured and shown in Fig. 2c. While the NIR absorption peak of the as-cast blend film is at 788 nm, that of the TA treated ones is blue-shifted to 780 nm with a decreased intensity. SVA, TA + SVA and SVA + TA post-treatments red-shift the NIR peaks with enhanced absorption intensities. In addition, a slight yet noticeable blue-shift can be observed for the SVA + TA blends in comparison to the absorption of SVA samples, which is similar to the absorption changes when the as-cast blend is thermally annealed, indicating the different aggregation behaviors induced by TA and SVA.
We measure the current density–voltage characteristics in the dark under reverse and forward biases (Fig. S8†) to investigate the rectification behavior of the as-cast devices and the devices with SVA and SVA + TA. In comparison to the as-cast devices, the SVA treated devices show higher current density under forward bias but smaller dark current density under reverse bias, leading to an enhanced rectification ratio of 5.04 × 105versus 7.54 × 104 for the as-cast devices at ±2 V. Upon further TA (SVA + TA), the forward current densities decrease while the reverse ones increase, reducing the diode performance. These results suggest that SVA suppresses the leakage current and improves the diode behavior but further TA has an adverse effect, possibly due to the overgrowth of ZnP2BT-RH crystalline phases and the changes of the vertical phase separation.66
We also investigate the hole mobilities of ZnP2BT-RH:PC71BM blend films under the different processing conditions using a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ZnP2BT-RH:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag by the SCLC (space-charge limited current) method. As shown in Fig. S9† and listed in Table S5,† the as-cast blend shows a mobility of 1.21 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the blend with TA shows a similar mobility of 1.43 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, the TA + SVA and SVA treated ZnP2BT-RH:PC71BM blends show mobilities of up to 3.40 × 10−4 and 4.94 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, more than one order of magnitude higher than those without SVA. These values are also higher than that of CS-DP-based devices with TA + SVA (1.44 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), indicating better charge transport in ZnP2BT-RH-based devices. In line with the FF changes, further TA of the SVA film (SVA + TA) reduced the hole mobility to 1.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.
To gain insight into the exciton dissociation and charge generation of ZnP2BT-RH based solar cells under different processing conditions, we further investigate the relationships between the photocurrent density (Jph) and the effective voltage (Veff) of the cells (Fig. 2d). Jph and Veff are defined by the equations Jph = JL − JD and Veff = V0 − Va, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively, V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage.67 As shown in Fig. 2d, the Jph values of the devices with TA + SVA and SVA are markedly higher and almost saturated (Jsat) at a relatively lower Veff, indicating more efficient exciton dissociation and carrier collection. The Jph values of the as-cast and TA treated devices, on the other hand, are still not saturated even when Veff is 5 V, an indication of severe charge recombination. It is generally assumed that all the photo-generated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers when the Veff is high enough. Therefore, the saturation current (Jsat) only depends on the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) calculated from Jsat = qLGmax, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer.39,68 The SVA devices show a maximum exciton Gmax of 1.05 × 1028 m−3 s−1 (Jsat = 183.9 A m−2) that is higher than that of the devices processed with TA + SVA (Gmax is 1.01 × 1028 m−3 s−1 at a Jsat of 178.1 A m−2). The increased Gmax indicates the generation of more excitons, which is consistent with the enhanced absorbance as shown in Fig. 2c. It should be noted that the small Gmax difference cannot fully account for the large PCE difference. Another parameter, P(E,T), determined by Jph/Jsat under short circuit conditions, should be taken into consideration to indicate the charge collection probabilities. The P(E,T) values for TA + SVA and SVA devices are 92.5% and 95.2%, respectively. The larger Gmax and P(E,T) values for SVA devices correlate well with the higher JSC and FF. For SVA + TA devices, although the Jsat is similar to that of SVA devices, the moderate P(E,T) of 87.3% suggests inefficient charge separation, leading to a poor FF of 56.19% and a moderate PCE of 7.83%. All these results reveal that SVA is the most efficient in enhancing the charge separation, which simultaneously improves JSC and FF.
The recombination process of these devices is investigated by measuring the JSC values at various light intensities. In principle, JSC shows a power-law dependence on light intensity for organic solar cells, which can be expressed as JSC ∝ (Plight)S (Plight is the light intensity and S is the exponential factor).69 When all free charges are swept out and collected at the electrodes prior to recombination, the S value should be 1. Fig. 3a shows the relationship of JSC against light intensity of the devices under the three different processing conditions, and the S values are calculated to be 0.931, 0.982 and 0.948 for the as-cast, SVA and SVA + TA devices, respectively. The highest S value of the SVA-treated device suggests most effective suppression of bimolecular recombination, leading to the highest JSC and FF. VOC values are also measured at various light intensities to get a deeper insight into the recombination mechanisms.70Fig. 3b shows the relationships between the VOC and the Plight of the devices under the three different processing conditions. Generally, a slope of 1 kBT/q implies that bimolecular recombination is the dominating mechanism (kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature and q is the elementary charge), while a dependence of VOC on light intensity with a slope of 2 kBT/q would be observed for trap-assisted or monomolecular recombination.71,72 The slope of 1.20 kBT/q for the ZnP2BT-RH-based devices without any post-treatment implies that the bimolecular recombination is dominant, possibly due to the good mixing of ZnP2BT-RH with PC71BM, which provides sufficient interfaces for exciton separation but non-ideal crystallinity for efficient charge transport, leading to severe bimolecular recombination between the holes and electrons. On the other hand, the SVA and SVA + TA treated devices show slopes of 1.45 and 1.54 kBT/q, respectively, suggesting that the bimolecular recombination can be significantly suppressed by SVA.

We also investigate the morphology of ZnP2BT-RH:PC71BM active layers under the different processing conditions, using atomic force microscopy (AFM), grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS). As shown in Fig. S10,† the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of the as-cast and SVA treated films are less than 1 nm, and the TA + SVA treated films show a slightly increased RMS of 1.5 nm. The GIXD profiles of the pure ZnP2BT-RH films and blend films under different processing conditions show more details of the intrinsic ordering of the components, as shown in Fig. 4 and S11.† For the ZnP2BT-RH samples spin-coated from pure THF solution, a sharp peak at 0.28 A−1 is observed in the low q region, attributable to the lamellar stacking in the (100) direction. The crystalline nature of ZnP2BT-RH becomes less pronounced when pyridine is used as an additive, as supported by the increased peak width, the reduced peak intensity at 0.28 A−1 and the disappearance of the peaks at 0.57 A−1 (200) and 0.85 A−1 (300) in the out-of-plane GIXD pattern. For TA or SVA films, higher order peaks at (200) and (300) reappear, indicating that TA and SVA promote the crystallization. In comparison to other samples, the d spacing of the (100) reflection of the SVA sample decreases slightly, in accordance with a tighter lamellar packing that is conducive to carrier transport. Furthermore, the π–π stacking peak at 1.86 A−1 is observed after TA or SVA treatment. The similar crystallinity of TA, TA + SVA and SVA + TA samples arises from the fact that the porphyrin crystallinity can be fixed after TA and is hard to change with further SVA. Therefore, the effects of TA on crystallization are greater than those of SVA. Subsequent TA of the SVA-treated film can provide crystallinity similar to the TA-only film. For the blend samples, the as-cast films show a weak π–π stacking reflection in the in-plane direction, indicating a weak edge-on crystal orientation. Diffuse Bragg rods are also observed in the in-plane direction. These features arise from the self-assembly of ZnP2BT-RH molecules into thin layers in the donor domains.48 The TA and SVA films show a quite broad, azimuthally independent (100) diffraction reflection at 0.28 A−1 (2.24 nm), indicating that there is no preferred crystal orientation and the transformation of crystals from edge-on to face-on. In addition, a broad reflection from PC71BM is seen at 1.31 A−1. Importantly, for the TA, TA + SVA, SVA or SVA + TA films, a π–π stacking peak (due to ZnP2BT-RH) can be seen at 1.86 A−1 (0.34 nm), which correlates with the improved JSC values. In addition, the peak areas of the films with TA + SVA and SVA are slightly larger than those of the TA and SVA + TA treated films, suggesting better crystallinity in TA + SVA and SVA treated films and are consistent with their better device performance.

The phase separation of these blend films is studied using resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) by taking advantage of the high optical contrast at the carbon K-edge (284.2 eV). Shown in Fig. 5 are the scattering profiles of the five blend films under the different processing conditions. The as-cast films show very low scattering intensities and no obvious interferences, suggesting a lack of phase separation due to the miscibility of ZnP2BT-RH and PC71BM that is mediated by pyridine. This is consistent with previous studies where strong recombination is commonly observed for well-mixed systems.27,72 For the TA-treated blend film, a plateau in the scattering is seen at ∼0.022 A−1, corresponding to a domain size of 28.6 nm. The low scattering intensity indicates a weak degree of phase separation, and thus, the TA devices show an only slightly improved JSC in comparison to the as-cast films. The SVA of the TA film leads to significantly enhanced scattering over the entire q region and an obvious peak is observed at 0.016 A−1, corresponding to a distance of 39.2 nm. The significantly increased scattering intensity suggests the enhanced phase separation, which correlates well with the increase in the PCE from 5.68% to 9.00%. For the SVA film, the phase separated domain size (44.8 nm) is slightly larger than that of the TA + SVA film, which is beneficial for more balanced exciton separation and charge transportation. Furthermore, the SVA film also has better phase purity. These collective morphological features correlate well with those of the champion devices from solvent vapor annealing. However, for the SVA + TA film, a sharp upturn in the scattering at very low q is observed, consistent with an increase in the surface roughness and the device performance. Other factors like the diffusion of PC71BM to the layer of PEDOT:PSS and vertical phase separation change after TA treatment were not observed contributing to the decrease in performance.

Conclusion
In summary, a dimeric porphyrin small molecule ZnP2BT-RH, where the two porphyrin units are linked with the electron withdrawing unit BT, has been developed for OSCs. The introduction of BT not only enhances the π electron delocalization to improve the intramolecular charge transfer and the molar extinction coefficient of the NIR absorption band but also downshifts the HOMO energy level, which are beneficial for VOC enhancement without sacrificing JSC for ZnP2BT-RH-based OSCs. SVA treatment induces π–π stacking and tightens lamellar packing, which benefits carrier transportation. The phase separation and improved phase purity of the SVA-treated films greatly enhance the exciton separation and carrier collection efficiency and reduce the recombination. After optimizing the processing conditions, excellent device performance with PCEs of up to 10.02% is achieved with a low Eloss of only 0.56 eV, which is the smallest Eloss reported to date for small molecule-based OSCs with PCEs more than 10%. The 10% PCE is the highest for porphyrin-based BHJ solar cells and also ranks as one of the highest values reported for small molecule solar cells.
