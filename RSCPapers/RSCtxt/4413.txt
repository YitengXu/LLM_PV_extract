    , Accepted 2nd June 2016First published on 7th June 2016AbstractCentimetre-scale CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite single crystals of high structural quality are grown by a new versatile method based on the use of a binary solvent mixture at a temperature as low as 70 °C. The growth rate is fast enough for a millimeter scale seed crystal to grow to the centimeter scale in a few hours.
Over the last few years, organo-lead trihalide hybrid perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) have generated tremendous interest in electronic and photonic applications such as solar cells,1–9 lasing,10,11 light-emitting diodes,12,13 and photodetectors.14–16 In particular, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have now achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 20.1%,9 following a rapid surge of development since PSC devices were first reported in 2009 with an efficiency of only 3.8%.17 This makes PSCs highly competitive to crystalline silicon and conventional thin film PV technologies using CIGS and CdTe. The success of perovskites in solar cells is mainly due to their superior characteristics including a high absorption coefficient,18 ambipolar transport properties,19 long carrier diffusion lengths,20 and low intrinsic recombination rates.21 Up to now, PSCs have been exclusively based on microcrystalline and polycrystalline thin films while single crystal devices remain out of reach due to the difficulty in growing large perovskite single crystals. However, more and more pieces of evidence show that grain boundaries, voids and surface defects within the microcrystalline perovskite films act as traps for the charge carriers during solar cell operation, thus leading to reduced PV performances and significant hysteretic effects in J–V curves.22–25 Therefore, many efforts have been made in improving the crystalline quality of the films,26–29 which is expected to reduce the overall bulk defect density and mitigate hysteresis by suppressing charge recombination to finally lead to higher power conversion efficiencies. It is then clear that the availability of large centimeter scale perovskite single crystals could afford maximized device performances in PV cells and other applications.
As early as 1987, it was reported that CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals can be synthesized in concentrated aqueous solutions of HI acid containing Pb2+ ions and a proportional amount of CH3NH3+ ions.30 Following that method, CH3NH3PbI3 large single crystals have been reported in recent years.31,32 Since then, other methods based on organic solutions have been developed to grow centimetric CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals.33,34 The trap density measured in these single-crystalline perovskites is extremely low in the range of 109–1010 cm−3, resulting in a high carrier mobility (164 ± 25 cm2 V−1 s−1) and long diffusion lengths (>175 μm). These results pave the way toward high-performance PSCs based on wafer-scale single crystalline perovskites.
However, the above crystal growth methods remain strenuous and time-consuming and are not appropriate for large-scale production. Recently, two different research groups observed that, in certain organic solvents, the solubility of CH3NH3PbI3 substantially decreases at increased temperatures.35,36 They grew large crystals by dissolving CH3NH3I and PbI2 into γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and subsequently heating the solution up to 110 °C. We describe here a fast and convenient method to grow high-quality centimetric CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals under mild conditions (70 °C) by using a novel solvent engineering approach and fully characterized them.
In the first step (Fig. 1a), six flasks are filled with a CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution constituted by 1 mL of GBL (density = 1.14 g mL−1), 195.5 mg of CH3NH3I (1.23 × 10−3 mole) and 572.8 mg of PbI2 (1.23 × 10−3 mole). Then, various volumes of acetonitrile (respectively 0; 0.2; 0.4; 0.6; 0.8; and 1.0 mL) are added into the six successive flasks. After being magnetically stirred at room temperature (25 °C) for 1 h, the content of the first flask (without addition of acetonitrile) remains unclear, indicating that both CH3NH3PbI3 precursors possess a limited solubility in GBL at 25 °C. Interestingly, although the two CH3NH3PbI3 precursors have a poor solubility in acetonitrile (ACN),37 the GBL/ACN binary solvent mixture reveals to be a good solvent and all these solutions look optically clear. When the solutions are heated to 70 °C, within 30 minutes small black crystals of CH3NH3PbI3 precipitate from the solutions that contain ACN volumes equal or higher than 0.6 mL (Fig. 1b). The number of crystals increases as the added ACN volume increases. We note that the solubility of CH3NH3I and PbI2 precursors in GBL/ACN binary solvent mixtures is more sensitive to temperature than in pure GBL (Fig. S1, ESI†).

In the second step, one tiny black CH3NH3PbI3 crystal is picked out from a flask and introduced into a new flask containing a fresh solution of both CH3NH3I and PbI2 precursors with a similar composition to that in step one (Fig. 2). The solution is again heated up to 70 °C, thus allowing the crystal seed to further grow in size. By repeating this heat-and-pick process, the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals gradually grow into larger sizes (Fig. 2b). It is noteworthy that the crystals prepared by this low-temperature method have a growth rate as fast as those prepared using other methods reported previously.35,36 After only 6 hours their diameter becomes close to 1 cm and even reaches 1.7 cm after 3 days.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the crystallinity of the as-prepared CH3NH3PbI3 crystals. Fig. 3 shows the powder XRD patterns of the CH3NH3PbI3 powder milled from the large crystals. For comparison, we also calculated the standard pattern of CH3NH3PbI3 crystals with a pure tetragonal phase (Fig. 3, red pattern). It shows that the main peaks for the as-prepared CH3NH3PbI3 are at 2θ = 14.1°, 28.4° and 40.4° (Fig. 3, black pattern). The positions of the main peaks reveal that the as-prepared CH3NH3PbI3 crystals possess a tetragonal structure. Meanwhile, the clear peaks of (121) and (022) (splitting from the (111) peak of the cubic phase) at 2θ = 23.5° and 2θ = 24.5° further confirm that the crystal adopts a tetragonal phase with high crystalline quality.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns recorded on the CH3NH3PbI3 powder (black) and centimetric single crystals (blue). The red pattern is calculated for the perovskite powder. 
High-resolution XRD was also used to examine the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal. The 2θ scan results (Fig. 3, blue pattern) show only diffraction peaks from the (112), (020), (224), (040), (336) and (060) planes at 2θ = 19.89°, 19.99°, 40.43°, 40.63°, 62.44° and 62.76°, respectively. These peaks reveal that the as-prepared large CH3NH3PbI3 crystals possess single-crystalline nature. To confirm this, pole figures were obtained for one of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal natural facets. The results are in agreement with the pattern expected for the {010} facet, indicating that the 〈010〉 plane is parallel to the sample surface. By calculating the Euler angles, we can conclude that this crystal exposes its natural facets {010} and {112} (Fig. S2, ESI†).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of one non-perfect crystal (Fig. 4 and Fig. S3, ESI†) show that the surfaces of the crystal are not smooth; some areas are smooth while in other areas, islands and terraces are obviously seen. The tetragonal islands are indicative of a layer-by-layer growth mode of the perovskite crystal. During the simultaneous nucleation and growth of pyramids, tetragonal islands form on the surface of the crystal, and may evolve into truncated tetragonal bipyramids with a dominant (100) plane. The steps and terraces are also seen which can be the boundaries of the growing truncated tetragonal bipyramids.

In order to examine the thermal stability of the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals, we used thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen flow from room temperature up to 600 °C (Fig. 5). It has been reported that CH3NH3PbI3 thin films decompose at temperatures as low as ≈150 °C.26,36 In contrast the TGA trace of our perovskite crystals shows no signature of mass loss up to 240 °C, indicating a higher thermal stability as compared to thin films. Beyond 240 °C, the crystals undergo a 20% mass loss of HI, followed by a 6% loss of the CH3NH2 component at 337 °C, indicating stronger binding of the amine group in the perovskite matrix than HI. At around 385 °C and beyond, the inorganic precursor PbI2 is gradually sublimed.

The arrow at 337 °C indicates the loss of CH3NH2 while that at 385 °C indicates the gradual sublimation of the PbI2 precursor. 
Finally, the optical properties of the large CH3NH3PbI3 crystal were studied by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 6a, in comparison with the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film, the PL peak position of the large single crystal shows a slight red shift (775 nm for thin films and 783 nm for single crystals). This could indicate a tighter lattice strain in thin films than in single crystals.34 Moreover, the time-dependent PL signals of single crystals and thin films were measured at their respective PL peak wavelengths. Biexponential fitting was performed to determine the carrier dynamics (Fig. 6b). The single crystal exhibited a fast (τ = 4.9 ± 0.1 ns) and slower (τ = 57.0 ± 0.7 ns) lifetime. The fast one is attributed to the carrier recombination lifetime on the surface while the slow one is attributed to that from beneath the surface (in the bulk).34 Meanwhile, only a fast decay can be observed in the thin film sample (τ = 5.1 ± 0.1 ns). The front face of the crystal would then be similar to a thin film where the recombination lifetime is strongly influenced by impurities, surface defects, and dangling bonds, thus yielding a faster lifetime of ≈5 ns. The longer recombination lifetime in the bulk of the crystal suggests a greatly reduced trap density as compared to the surface and that of the polycrystalline thin film and is characteristic of the bulk properties of CH3NH3PbI3.33,34

In summary, we succeeded in growing centimetric CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite single crystals of high-quality using a convenient novel method based on the use of an ACN/GBL binary solvent mixture at low temperature (70 °C). The XRD analysis and SEM images confirm that the as-prepared CH3NH3PbI3 crystals are single crystals with a tetragonal structure. A slow carrier dynamic is observed on the time-dependent PL signals, which reveals the lifetime of carriers propagating deeper in the crystal. Meanwhile, the TGA result indicates that the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal possesses better thermal stability than the common thin films. Our original solvent engineering method provides new opportunities towards the use of large CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals for both fundamental physical studies and technological applications in PV solar cells.
