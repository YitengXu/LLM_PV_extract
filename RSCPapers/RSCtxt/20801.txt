    , Accepted 14th February 2020First published on 15th February 2020AbstractBioorthogonal reactions based on manipulating the physicochemical and biological behavior of natural cells have gained tremendous attention for meeting the demands for multifunctional microorganisms without decreasing cell viability. Described herein is a novel bioorthogonal method for microorganism (Aspergillus oryzae) modification which coats the microorganism with a photothermal conversion cloth for staying bioactive in cold environments. Two steps, including ferric ions primarily binding to the microorganism cell surface, followed by in situ polymerization of pyrrole, are adopted to actualize highly efficient polypyrrole modification on the microorganism surfaces. The production of α-amylase by Aspergillus oryzae and α-amylase catalytic ability are two representative indexes of cold adaptation as confirmed by a starch decomposition test. This strategy for coating microorganisms with photothermal cloth is biocompatible and cost-effective, and can achieve non-contact modulation, which also offers great promise for generating living cell–polymer hybrid structures based on other microorganism systems for low-temperature environmental adaptation.
Introduction
Photo-sensitive microorganisms are involved in many aspects of our lives such as photosynthesis,1,2 antibiotics production3 and the fermentation industry.4 As there are limited types of natural microorganisms, to meet the increasing comprehensive demands for better light sensibility5 and environmental adaptation,6 a flood of cellular engineering methods for microorganism multi-functionalization have entered the public eye.7 Genetic engineering, particularly based on heterologous expression in microorganism cells, has gained significant momentum in rendering non-photosynthetic systems with the property of photosensitivity8,9 and improving photo-production efficiency.10 Nevertheless, the complex operation procedure, inferior success rate and unknown biosecurity have impeded its extensive development.11 Recent years have witnessed a tremendous increase in bioorthogonal reactions for single cell level manipulation of physicochemical and biological properties of natural cells.12 The copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (Click) reaction,13,14 the atom-transfer radical polymerization15 (ATRP) and the reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerization16 (RAFT) are excellent alternatives to the most widely recognized examples of bioorthogonal chemistry, which have been rapidly embraced in derivatizing biomacromolecules,17 viruses,18 and cells,19,20 especially for surface labelling,21 fluorescence visualization22 and bacterial photosensitization.23 Despite the massive progress made in photosynthetic systems for biofuels, little attention has been paid to photo-regulated biocatalysts for accommodating ambient temperature variation by means of bioorthogonal methods.24 As an efficient way to convert light energy to thermal energy, photothermal conversion possesses the characteristics of temporal monitoring, non-invasive manipulation, and environmental friendliness.25–27 Bioorthogonal systems with the capability of photothermal conversion are anticipated to exhibit remote regulation of physiological activities of microorganisms against environmental changes.28–32
Polypyrrole has been proved as a superb photothermal polymer for efficient heat generation under solar illumination.33,34 Additionally, its reasonable biocompatibility35,36 also offers great promise for creating living cell–polymer hybrid structures in bioorthogonal modulation.37Aspergillus oxyzae (fermentation cells, referred to simply as Asp hereafter) is a representative eukaryotic unicellular microorganism used in the fermentation industry.38 This sort of fungus is thermally sensitive, as it generally produces a larger amount of α-amylase with higher catalytic activity for decomposing starch into glucose and maltose upon an appropriate increase in temperature.39 In this study, we successfully endowed Asp cells with photothermal ability by bioorthogonally coating a polypyrrole cloth on their surfaces. These thermally-sensitive Asp cells became photo-sensitive, corresponding to faster generation of α-amylase and higher enzymatic activity under solar light illumination. Compared with traditional temperature-regulated systems to activate microorganisms, the photothermal strategy offers the great advantages of lower energy consumption and broad applicable scope for low-temperature environmental adaptation.40
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 illustrates the bioorthogonal chemistry involved in coating a layer of photothermal cloth on Asp cells. The photothermal cloth was polypyrrole, which was formed in situ on the Asp cell surfaces via a two-step polymerization process. Typically, ferric chloride, serving as an oxidant, first associated with the cell surface, driven by electrostatic interactions. Once pyrrole was added, ferric ions (Fe3+) initiated the oxidative polymerization of pyrrole into polypyrrole on the fungal cells (see more details in the ESI†). Superior to naked cells, the cells with polypyrrole cloth are supposed to have photothermal conversion capability. Playing the same role as thermal regulation, this photothermal effect induces the Asp cells to generate more α-amylase and also improves α-amylase activity for catalyzing the decomposition of starch into maltose or glucose.

A series of characterizations were first carried out to verify the joint connection between the polypyrrole cloths and the Asp cells. Zeta potential measurements revealed that the cell surface was naturally electronegative, due to the isoelectric point of cellular proteins being lower than the pH value of the culture medium. Upon addition of ferric ions, the zeta potential gradually increased as a consequence of electrostatic interactions between Fe3+ and the carboxylate groups (Fig. S1, ESI†). After Fe3+ adsorption, the Asp cells were exposed to pyrrole, and a layer of polypyrrole was predicted to form on the cell surfaces based on the oxidation of pyrrole by Fe3+. Both thermogravimetric (TGA) and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) analyses confirmed that a fresh thermogravimetric loss appeared at 270 °C, which was in accordance with the thermal decomposition of polypyrrole solely (Fig. S2, ESI†). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) also proved the successful combination of Asp with polypyrrole, according to the characteristic peaks at 1247 cm−1 and 1530 cm−1 that were assigned to the C–N and CC stretching of polypyrrole, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†). It is worth noting that the adsorbed Fe3+ content determined the degree of polymerization to form polypyrrole, which further influenced the cell surface morphology as well as the cell viability. As summarized in Fig. 1, the surface morphologies of polypyrrole–Asp hybrids prepared using different Fe3+ concentrations were viewed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Compared with naked cells (Fig. 1a), the polypyrrole-coated cells were closely wrapped in a layer of polypyrrole cloth (Fig. 1b–f). Specifically, on increasing the Fe3+ concentration from 0 mM to 50 mM, polypyrrole nanoparticles gradually grew into a compacted PPy layer on the cell surfaces, if the adsorption time was kept unchanged. This gradually varying growth of polypyrrole was also monitored with an optical microscope (Fig. S4, ESI†). Notably, the transparent Asp cells turned into tiny black globules, corresponding to the successful deposition of polypyrrole on the cell surface.
 Fig. 1  SEM images of Asp (a) and polypyrrole–Asp hybrids synthesized with the use of different Fe3+ concentrations: 5 mM (b), 10 mM (c), 15 mM (d), 20 mM (e), 50 mM (f). 
However, more polypyrrole grown on the cell surface threatens the cell viability because the compact layer may isolate the cells from extracellular nutrients. According to the live/dead fluorescence staining analysis, which is a well-established cell viability assay to evaluate esterase activity in cells,41 the live and dead cells could be distinguished with the use of a kit containing fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI). Cell viability was identified by calculating the green/red spots ratio, in which the green and red colours represented the live and dead cells, respectively. Specifically, the cell viability dropped to 37.1% and 8.3% when the Fe3+ concentration was set as 20 and 50 mM, respectively (Fig. 2e and f). In comparison, for lower Fe3+ concentration during the bioorthogonal pyrrole polymerization, higher cell viability of the fungal cells was maintained. 100%, 96%, 93.5% and 84.8% of the cells survived when the Fe3+ concentration was 0 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM and 15 mM, respectively (Fig. 2a–d). To further prove the retention of Asp viability at low Fe3+ concentration (10 mM as an example, see more details in the ESI†), the polypyrrole-coated Asp cells were placed back in culture medium for sequential subculturing. Budding reproduction is a representative phenomenon of offspring generation in Asp cells. As illustrated by SEM observation, buds were successfully formed from the polypyrrole-coated Asp cells (Fig. 2g) and finally grew into independent cells when the budding reproduction came to an end (Fig. 2h). It is worth noting that the newly divided cells were totally naked, suggesting that the parental generation were biologically active, yet the photothermal cloth was not transferred in the fission process. Unless otherwise indicated, 10 mM was chosen as the optimized Fe3+ concentration for growing polypyrrole on fungal cells.

The as-prepared polypyrrole–Asp hybrids were supposed to be light-sensitive based on the excellent photothermal properties of polypyrrole cloth. As compared in Fig. 3a, the non-polypyrrole-coated Asp suspension was milky white and the polypyrrole-coated Asp suspension was black. Notably, the polypyrrole-coated Asp cells showed stronger light-absorbing capability in the visible and near infrared light windows that mainly constitute the solar spectrum. When subjected to solar radiation, the solution consisting of polypyrrole–Asp hybrids (10 mg mL−1) rapidly warmed up. To be specific, setting the environmental temperature as 15 °C to simulate cold conditions at which cellular metabolism was deactivated, an increase of 25 °C was observed for the polypyrrole–Asp group under 1 sun illumination for 30 min (Fig. 3b), remarkably higher than that observed for the neat Asp group (Fig. S5, ESI†). On turning off the light for 30 min of cooling, the temperature returned to its ambient value of 15 °C. It is noteworthy that the temperature increase was still prominent at lower solar power density. Increases of 20 °C and 16 °C were achieved under 0.8 and 0.6 sun illumination for 30 min, respectively. However, fungal cells might be sterilized if they are overheated by the photothermal effect. This possibility should be completely avoided before using the cells in photo-triggered biocatalysis. As illustrated in Fig. 3c, the live and dead cells could be distinguished using the live/dead fluorescence staining analysis as mentioned above. A proportion of cells were sterilized under one sun illumination for 30 min. Intriguingly, more than 90% and 85% of fungal cells could survive under 0.6 and 0.8 sun illumination for 30 min, respectively. These studies laid the groundwork for manipulating the temperature of fungal cells for maintaining efficient cellular metabolism while keeping the viability of the cells using appropriate solar power density or illumination time.

Starch decomposition is one of the most important reactions in the cellular metabolism of Asp cells, involving α-amylase production and α-amylase catalyzed polysaccharide decomposition. They are both temperature dependent so that Asp cells are preserved at the right temperature for efficient starch decomposition in fermentation. The two processes were investigated separately in order to fully understand the temperature influence on the metabolism of Asp cells. Typically, α-amylase was extracted via the (NH4)2SO4/PEG two-phase extracting method42 and the enzyme production with temperature variation was evaluated by the Coomassie Brilliant Blue method43 (see more details in the ESI†). As visually observed in Fig. 4a, a brighter blue color represented higher α-amylase production. Based on quantification by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 4b), α-amylase production kept rising as the temperature increased from 5 °C to 28 °C, yet it sharply dropped when the cells were overwarmed. Therefore, 28 °C is regarded as the optimum temperature for enzyme production. The generated α-amylase was then subjected to the iodine–starch method to identify its enzymatic activity at different temperatures. The degree of starch hydrolysis, standing for the α-amylase activity, could be ascertained by monitoring the absorption intensity at the wavelength of 598 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†). In a temperature range from 5 °C to 60 °C, the iodine–starch solution gradually faded to transparent, corresponding to continuously improved catalytic activity (Fig. 4c and d). However, the enzymatic activity was quickly lost when the temperature was increased to above 60 °C, which was due to the thermal-induced denaturation of proteins.

Serving as an indirect means of warming, photothermal conversion is also envisioned to be able to accelerate the metabolism of Asp cells. To demonstrate the comprehensive influences of the photothermal effect on the cell metabolism, an assessment of polysaccharide decomposition in the presence of polypyrrole-coated Asp cells was carried out under 0.6 sun illumination. Typically, two cuvettes containing starch with the concentration of 10 g L−1 (2.0 mL) were placed in the white and dark positions of a traditional Chinese Tai-Chi diagram to vividly represent luminous and nonluminous treatment (Fig. 5a). Solar light was immediately applied to the luminous batch when polypyrrole-coated Asp solution (10.0 mg mL−1, 20 μL) was added. After light illumination for 15 min, I2/KI solution (0.2 g L−1, 0.2 mL) was added to both the luminous and nonluminous systems to allow the chromogenic reaction of residual starch. In principle, a stronger colour change should be observed if less starch is decomposed into maltose and glucose. As predicted, the starch in the luminous batch exhibited faster decomposition, corresponding to more active Asp cells. Specifically, after solar illumination for 15 min, the mixture solution remained colourless when I2/KI solution was added (Fig. 5b and ESI,† Video S1). However, a mazarine colour was clearly observed for the nonluminous batch, indicating that the Asp cells generated less α-amylase under the nonluminous conditions. As monitored by a thermometer, the temperature of the luminous batch rose to 24.1 °C in 15 min, which was close to the optimum temperature for α-amylase production (Fig. 5c). Certainly, higher temperature also benefits enzyme catalysis, although the contributions of the photothermal effect to enzyme production and enzyme catalysis are hard to differentiate. Investigations were also carried out at different solar illumination times (Fig. 5d). The starch concentration could be precisely determined according to UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and optical images of solutions at various illumination times are supplied in Fig. S7 (ESI†). To be specific, the starch concentration dropped from 10 g L−1 to 0.34 g L−1 in the luminous batch after solar illumination for 15 min, yet it still remained at 8.42 g L−1 in the nonluminous batch. In order to present a more intuitive illustration of hydrolysis, I2/KI solution was added before light illumination, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). As a consequence of starch decomposition, the mixture solution gradually faded to colourless. However, hardly any colour change was observed in the nonluminous batch, indicating less α-amylase generation by Asp cells without solar illumination (ESI,† Video S2).

(c) Time-dependent temperature change in the luminous and nonluminous batches. (d) Time-dependent starch concentration change in luminous and nonluminous batches. The power density is set as 0.6 sun in order to ensure high cell viability. 
Insight was also provided into recycling in the photo-induced biocatalysis to ensure the long-term service of the polypyrrole-coated Asp cells, especially in industrial production. A three-round experiment was conducted to assess the repeated regulation of cellular metabolism based on photothermal conversion (see more details in the ESI†). Noting that α-amylase should have been produced in the first round, fading of the solution during the second and third rounds only happened under solar illumination, suggesting that the photothermal effect plays a large role in activating starch decomposition. Specifically, the residual starch concentrations in the three-round tests with solar illumination were 0.34, 0.89 and 1.18 g L−1, while they were 8.93, 8.42 and 8.00 g L−1 without solar illumination (Fig. S9, ESI†). These results confirmed the reliable bioactivity of polypyrrole-coated fungus cells after multiple photothermal treatments, offering great promise for repeated microorganism-based catalysis.
Conclusions
In this work, we presented a straightforward approach to coating photothermal cloth on Aspergillus oryzae cells, without involving complicated synthesis or toxic solvents. This bioorthogonal chemistry was established on the living cells and the viability of the cells was negligibly influenced under the optimized modification conditions. The Asp cells with photothermal cloth became photo-active, in that they exhibited higher throughput of enzyme production under solar illumination. Owing to the intrinsic simplicity and generality of the strategy, it is envisioned that the strategy of photothermal modification could be readily extended to other microorganisms, opening great opportunities in photosynthesis, antibiotics production and fermentation industries.
