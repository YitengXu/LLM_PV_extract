DSSCs were fabricated by incorporating different concentrations (0.6 to 3.0 wt%) of Au NRs into TiO2 photoanodes. With an increase in the concentration of the Au NRs, the light absorption by the Y123 dye loaded photoanodes enhanced linearly, but the charge extraction was susceptible to the concentration of the Au NRs. With optimized concentrations (∼1.8 wt%) of the Au NRs, the photocurrent of the DSSC enhanced from 12.45 to 15.74 mA cm−2, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) improved from 5.31 to 8.86%. The DSSC performance was also verified using Au nanoparticles (the PCE was enhanced from 5.31 to 7.72%) for comparison with the Au NR DSSC performance, which demonstrated the advantage of the Au NRs’ shape effect with longitudinal SPR due to the modified light interaction. To explain the experimental observations of the plasmonic DSSC, the Au NRs’ extinction efficiency and spatial distribution of the near-fields in complete and porous TiO2 media were also estimated using the finite-element method.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) seem to be an alternative solution for niche applications in comparison to conventional silicon solar cells because of their low production cost, easy fabrication, and tunable optical properties (such as color and transparency). As of now, DSSCs have shown 13% power conversion efficiency (PCE) with organic dye SM315 and cobalt electrolyte.1 One of the important steps in DSSCs is to harvest incident photons efficiently, as the light harvesting efficiency of a sensitizing dye can directly affect the charge carrier collection and photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. With this motivation, a few methods have been reported on the structural changes in dye molecules to increase light absorption at longer wavelengths by reorienting thiocyanate ligands, changing bipyridyl ligands or even by replacing the central ruthenium metal of dyes by osmium. However, the overall PCE of DSSCs did not improve considerably enough because of the reduction in light absorption at the dye's absorption peak wavelength (∼530 nm).2
To improve light absorption in DSSCs, new dye molecules (indolines, coumarins, and squaraines) have also been used in DSSCs, but the PCE was much lower than that obtained with standard dyes (N719 and N3).2–4 Thus, the relatively poor performance of a DSSC is either due to the poor absorption around 500–600 nm or because it is unable to generate appropriate electronic configurations that match with the triiodide electrolyte and/or the photoanode well. The primary concerns with the standard N719 dye are that it has a small extinction coefficient, as well as two carboxyl ligands (–COOH), as an excess number of carboxyl ligands might also increase the electron recombination in DSSCs.5 There are new organic dyes (Y123, C218, and JF419) that have recently been synthesized with a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) structure, which have a large extinction coefficient with one –COOH group, and can reduce the thickness of the photoanode and the sensitisation time and improve the PCE of the DSSCs.5–8
Recently, another new approach has emerged to enhance the light absorption in DSSCs using plasmonic metal nanostructures (Ag and Au) in a mesoporous TiO2 layer, which improves the light absorption and the PCE further.9,10 After light illumination, the metal nanoparticles’ free electrons respond to the incident electromagnetic field, which results in localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) with an intense near-field around the nanoparticles (NPs).11 This LSPR of the metal NPs can be tuned by changing the size, shape, composition and even the dielectric environment. The metal NPs enhance the light absorption in DSSCs by coupling the LSPR’s near-field to surrounding dye molecules, and also that of the far-field (by the wide angle scattering) based on the photoanode’s thickness in the DSSC.12,13 The light absorption by the dye molecules can be enhanced by tuning the metal nanostructures’ LSPR wavelengths to wavelengths complementary to the sensitizer.14
Most of the reported work on the enhancement of the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs is based on spherical Au/Ag NPs, but the improvement of the devices is restricted to shorter wavelengths only (430 and 530 nm).15–17 Previously, we have also explored the LSPR effects of Ag nanocubes and Au@SiO2 core–shell NPs on DSSCs based on graphene/TiO2 nanotube composites, and obtained a significant improvement in the photocurrent and PCE of the DSSCs.18,19 With Au/Ag nanorods (NRs), one can generate the LSPR modes in a unique way due to the transverse and longitudinal surface plasmon oscillation modes in a nanorod along the short and long axes, respectively, and the longitudinal modes can be tuned easily from the visible to the near IR region by varying the aspect ratio of the nanorods.20,21 Here, in this study, we have explored the effects of Au NRs on the performance of organic Y123 DSSCs, and also compared the device performance to that obtained with Au NPs. With an optimized concentration of Au NRs, we observed an enhancement in the absorption and the DSSC performance. The experimental observations are supported by simulations of the Au NRs’ extinction efficiency and near-field spatial distribution in TiO2 media theoretically, using finite-element analysis.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of Au nanorods
Au NRs were synthesized by the seed-mediated growth method.22 Initially, a Au NP seed solution was prepared by adding an aqueous NaBH4 (10 mM, 0.6 mL) solution of the mixed aqueous solution of CTAB (200 mM, 5 mL) and HAuCl4 (0.05 mM, 5 mL) under mild stirring. The solution was further stirred for 30 min. The as-prepared Au seed solution (20 μL) was added to a growth solution of CTAB (100 mM, 5 mL), AgNO3 (10 mM, 150 μL), HAuCl4 (10 mM, 5 mL) and L-ascorbic acid (100 mM, 78 μL) under stirring. The Au NRs were grown overnight without stirring. The as-prepared Au NRs were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 min to remove excess CTAB and any other impurities. The Au NRs were washed and redispersed in ethanol for further use.
2.2 Device fabrication and characterization
Initially, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates were cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol under ultrasonic treatment for 20 min each. The TiO2 compact layer (∼80 nm) was deposited on the cleaned FTO glass substrates by aerosol spray pyrolysis at 450 °C using an ethanol solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (1:10, volume ratio) as a precursor and nitrogen as a carrier gas. After that, an ∼8 μm thick mesoporous TiO2 active layer was coated by a doctor blade method using a commercial TiO2 paste (DSL, 18 NR-T, Dyesol), dried at 125 °C for 5 min, and then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. Au NRs and Au NPs of different concentrations (0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 and 3.0 wt%) were incorporated into the TiO2 paste to fabricate plasmonic photoanode films. To improve the light absorption of the device, on the top of active mesoporous TiO2/plasmonic photoanodes, a ∼4 μm thick TiO2 scattering layer (DSL, 18NR-AO, Dyesol) was also deposited, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling, the photoanodes were subjected to TiCl4 (40 mM) treatment for 30 min at 70 °C, followed by deionized water and ethanol rinsing sequentially and again annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. The as fabricated photoanodes were immersed in a 0.1 mM solution of the Y123 dye (prepared with 5 mM 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholic acid (chenodeoxy-cholic acid) in a 4-tert-butanol/acetonitrile mixture of 1:1 v/v) and kept for 12 h at room temperature. For the platinum (Pt) counter electrode (CE), a solution of H2PtCl6 (2 mg mL−1) was drop casted on the FTO-coated glass substrate and annealed at 400 °C for 15 min. The dye-sensitized photoanode and Pt CE were assembled and sealed with a 25 μm thick Surlyn polymer spacer. The iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) electrolyte was inserted through a drilled hole in the CE before sealing with the Surlyn hot melt polymer and a glass slide (a schematic of the as prepared DSSC is presented in Fig. 1). The active area of the DSSC was adjusted to 0.25 cm2 using a black metallic mask during the current density–voltage (J–V) measurements.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the DSSC containing Au NRs in the TiO2 photoanode. 
The morphology of the Au NRs was analyzed using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, TECHNAI G2, USA). Absorption measurements were carried out using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 1050, USA). The J–V characteristics of the DSSCs were measured under one sun conditions (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), with a Keithley 2440 source meter, and a xenon lamp light source of 450 W equipped with an Oriel Class AAA solar simulator (Newport, USA). Incident Photon-to-Current Efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using a SpeQuest Quantum efficiency measurement system (Rera Solutions, The Netherlands) equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp. The IPCE spectra were recorded under a constant light bias of 10 mW cm−2, with a monochromatic light chopping frequency of 20 Hz. Prior to use, the system was calibrated with an NREL certified silicon photodiode. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted using an electrochemical impedance analyzer (Biologic science instruments, SP-300) with an applied AC voltage of 10 mV in a frequency range of 100 mHz to 1 MHz under one sun illumination under open circuit conditions.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 2a shows the TEM micrograph of the Au NRs; the average length and diameter of the Au NRs are 30 ± 5 nm and 18 ± 2 nm, respectively, with an aspect ratio of ∼1.6 nm. The TEM image of the Au NPs that are ∼30 nm in size is shown in the inset of Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b shows the absorption spectra of the Au NPs and Au NRs. The Au NPs showed a SPR peak around 525 nm, and the Au NRs showed two SPR peaks around 520 and 675 nm, which correspond to the transverse and longitudinal surface plasmon oscillation modes, respectively. The Au NRs’ two SPR modes are due to the difference in the free electron excitation by the incident light in the different directions of the NRs.23 The transverse SPR is associated with electron oscillations along the transverse direction of the Au NRs, and its resonance absorption is in the range of 510–530 nm. The longitudinal SPR is associated with electron oscillations along the longitudinal direction of the Au NRs; its resonance absorption peak is in the visible region, which can be tuned from the visible to the near IR region by increasing the aspect ratio of the Au NRs which does not affect the surrounding dielectric environment.24,25

Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra of the Y123 dye-sensitized photoanodes with different concentrations of the Au NRs. One can clearly see an enhancement in light absorption with an increase in the Au NR concentration due to the LSPR absorption. The dye molecules around these Au NRs can absorb more photons than regular incident light due to an enhancement in the electromagnetic field/optical density around the Au NRs. In addition, the broad angle light scattering by the Au NRs can improve the light absorption by a photon path length enhancement in the device structure.26

To investigate the role of the Au NRs’ (as well as the Au NPs’) LSPR on the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs, J–V and IPCE measurements were carried out. The J–V and IPCE graphs of the DSSCs comprising different concentrations of Au NRs in the TiO2 photoanodes are presented in Fig. 4a and b, respectively, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen clearly that the JSC and PCE are enhanced linearly with an increase in the concentration of the Au NRs up to 1.8 wt% in the photoanode, and with a further increase in the Au NR concentration, the PCE of the DSSCs decreased. With the optimized concentration of 1.8 wt% Au NRs, the device exhibited a JSC of 15.74 mA cm−2 and PCE of 8.86%, whereas the device without the Au NRs exhibited a JSC of 12.45 mA cm−2 and PCE of 5.31%. The Au NR concentration-dependent light harvesting efficiency and charge collection at the photoanode are reflected clearly in the IPCE spectra (Fig. 4b). The enhancement of the IPCE is consistent with the trend of the JSC improvement as shown in Fig. 4a. The enhancement of the JSC is mainly due to the improvement of light absorption in the dye molecules by the Au NRs’ LSPR. Under the Au NRs’ intense near-field (optical density of states) background, the dye molecules can harvest a greater number of photons, which results in the generation of more photo-excited electrons in the dye molecules, and thereby an increase in the JSC. With 1.8 wt% Au NRs in the DSSC, the VOC is enhanced from 0.712 to 0.796 V, and the VOC values are also very sensitive to the Au NR concentration (Table 1). With an increase of the photo-generated electron density in the CB of TiO2, the quasi-Fermi energy level of the Au NR/TiO2 photoanode can shift to the negative potential side in comparison to the photoanode without the Au NRs,27 which can lead to an enhancement in the VOC. However, a further increase in the concentration of the Au NRs (2.4 and 3.0 wt%) resulted in a decrease of the JSC, VOC, and PCE, despite an enhancement in light absorption (Fig. 3). At high Au NR concentrations, possible adverse effects are the aggregation of the TiO2/Au NR particles and the introduction of more defect states at the Au NR/TiO2 interfaces, which can increase the charge carrier recombination and/or charge transfer resistance.28,29 Thus, an increase in the concentration of Au NRs can decrease the amount of dye loading over the mesoporous TiO2 photoanode. Moreover, there is a possibility that excess Au NRs/Au NPs block the pores of the mesoporous TiO2 film, which decreases the diffusion rate of the electrolyte into the TiO2 film. This was clearly explained in our previous studies by employing Ag nanowires and Au@SiO2 NPs in DSSCs.19,30 It was reported that excess Au NRs/Au NPs can act as self-recombination centres for excited electrons at the TiO2 interface, and an enhanced light absorption by these Au NRs/Au NPs can transform part of the incident solar light into heat (parasitic absorption).31,32

In addition, we have also evaluated the LSPR effect of the Au NPs to compare it with that of the Au NRs. The corresponding J–V and IPCE curves are presented in Fig. 4c and d, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. It is observed that with the Au NPs, the DSSC performance and IPCE are lower than those with the Au NRs. This is due to the relatively weak plasmonic effect of the Au NPs’ LSPR (Fig. 2b) on the Y123 dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes when compared to that of the longitudinal LSPR of the Au NRs.33 One can clearly observe the enhancement of the IPCE after 570 nm with the Au NRs in comparison to the Au NPs from Fig. 4b and d. The inset of Fig. 4b (normalized IPCE) shows the wavelength-dependent enhancement of the photocurrent from the 1.8 wt% Au NPs and Au NRs in comparison to the control DSSC. In the extended wavelength regions between 550 and 670 nm, the photocurrent enhancement of the Au NRs is clearly seen in comparison to the Au NPs. This is due to the longitudinal surface plasmon secondary light source absorption (enhanced optical density) at longer wavelengths by the Au NRs, which augmented the Y123 dye absorption and improved the photocurrent generation. This clearly shows that the Au NR structures have tunable LSPR, which can polarize the incoming light/radiation differently to the simple spherical Au nanostructures. Increasing the polarizability of the metal nanostructures can also result in multiple surface plasmon resonances, which can be utilized for improvements of the photocurrent generation at longer wavelengths by the device, and can also provide absorption mediation between the dyes and plasmonic metal nanostructures. However, it is worth mentioning that the optimization of the plasmonic metal nanostructure's shapes and their concentrations in the photoanodes is crucial for avoiding adverse optical/electrical effects to enhance DSSC performance.

Fig. 5 shows the Nyquist EIS spectra of Y123 dye-sensitized solar cells without and with different concentrations of the Au NRs. In the Nyquist plots (from left to right), the first small semi-circle (Z1) corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (RPt) at the counter electrode (Pt)/electrolyte interface, and the counter electrode is the same for all DSSCs, so there is no modification in the Z1 semicircle. The second semi-circle (Z2) in the complex plane (middle frequency range) corresponds to the charge transfer resistance against the recombination (Rct) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The large Z2 semicircle of the bare DSSC (without the Au NRs) is an indication of the large Rct at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. With the Au NRs, the diameter of the Z2 arc is reduced, which shows a decrease in the Rct. This observation is entirely opposite to that with the plasmonic DSSCs prepared with the metal nanoparticles, where the Rct is enhanced and this is explained based on the electron sink-effect, which reduces the amount of electron recombination with electrolyte holes.34
 Fig. 5  Nyquist plots of DSSCs without and with various concentrations of the Au NRs. 
However, similar observations like a decrease in the Rct (a reduced arc diameter in the mid-frequency region) are also reported from plasmonic DSSCs after Al nanoparticle integration into the photoanodes despite device performance enhancements.35 This unusual phenomenon is explained based on the difference in the work function of TiO2 and metal nanoparticles. The work function of Au nanostructures exhibits strong deviations from the work function of bulk Au.36 When the Au nanostructures’ work function is lower than the TiO2 work function (4.60 eV), it may not effectively obstruct the electron transfer from the TiO2 to the Au nanostructures, which can lead to the poor Rct. Despite the reduced Rct, the enhancement in the JSC with an optimum Au NR concentration can be due to the better carrier injection from the dye molecules to the TiO2, which is indirectly reflected in the Au NR concentration-dependent VOC enhancement due to the Fermi level shift of the TiO2. Furthermore, an increase of the Rct with more than 1.8 wt% Au NR concentration may lead to the ohmic heat loss of the absorbed photons, which may not contribute much to the carrier generation. This phenomenon may reduce the injection efficiency.
Furthermore, we also tried to support the experimental observations by simulating the Au NRs’ extinction efficiency and near-field distribution theoretically using the Finite Element Method (FEM, COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3b), and estimated the electric field enhancement around the Au NRs embedded in the TiO2 medium with and without porosity. Fig. 6a shows the extinction efficiency (Qext) of a single Au NR with a length of 30 nm and a diameter of 20 nm, and also two Au NRs of the same size with different distances between them. The Au NR (L/D = 30 nm/20 nm) shows a negligible amount of light scattering,37 so the maximum light will be absorbed by the NRs (Qext ∼ Qabs), and the light intensity will be attenuated as I(λ) = I0exp{−d·Cext(λ)}, where Cext is the extinction cross section and ‘d’ is the optical path. Each extinction spectrum in Fig. 6a shows two resonance peaks at ∼520 nm and at longer wavelengths (660–800 nm) owing to the transverse and longitudinal oscillation of the electrons, respectively. One can also observe that there is no significant shift in the resonance peak related to transverse oscillations besides the intensity change from 2.07 for the single Au NR to 3.8 for the double Au NRs with a 10 nm distance between them. The single Au NR exhibits a Qext value of 15.7 at a 662 nm wavelength corresponding to the longitudinal oscillations. In the case of two Au NRs, the distance-dependent (for 5, 10 and 15 nm) calculations show a variation in the Qext values (18.7, 20.3 and 17.6); a red shift in the LSPR peak positions (from 700 to 800 nm) and peak broadening are also observed. From this simple estimation, one can notice that there should be an optimum distance between the two Au NRs to obtain a high Qext value and an optimum LSPR peak position.38 The presented Qscat spectrum of the Au NRs in Fig. 6a is in the complete TiO2 medium. The practical TiO2 photoanode is porous in nature to the dye molecule infiltration, so the Qext is also estimated for a single Au NR and double Au NRs with 20% porosity (Fig. 6b). The Bruggeman effective medium approximation is used to estimate the effective dielectric constant (ε) of the TiO2 medium with porosity (p) by the following relation: (1)
 Fig. 6  (a) Extinction efficiency (Qext) of a single Au NR and two Au NRs with interparticle distances of 5, 10 and 15 nm embedded in the TiO2 medium, and (b) a single Au NR and two Au NRs (at a 10 nm interparticle distance) embedded in the TiO2 medium without and with 20% porosity. 
The longitudinal plasmon mode of the single Au NR exhibited a Qext maximum of 15.7 at 662 nm without TiO2 porosity, whereas with 20% porosity the Qext maximum reduced to 9.1 with a blue shift in the peak position to 607 nm, and a small blue shift was also observed in the transverse resonance peak. However, the shift in the longitudinal resonance peak is more significant. In the case of two Au NRs with 10 nm spacing in the 20% porous TiO2 medium, the Qext value also reduced to 17.0, and the peak position is blue shifted due to the reduced dielectric environment around the two Au NRs, caused by the porosity inclusion in comparison to the complete TiO2 medium. The quality factor is also estimated as a function of the resonance wavelength (λres), which is defined as the ratio of λres/Γ, where Γ is the full width at half maximum of the LSPR peak, which is obtained by fitting the SPR peak.39 For the Au NRs with a spacing of 10 nm, the quality factors are 21.2 and 29.5 for the 20% porous TiO2 and without the porous TiO2, respectively, which are the maximum values among all the combinations. The large quality factor of any metal nanostructure represents the long surface plasmon oscillation lifetime, which is beneficial for the near-field induced photocurrent improvement.

Fig. 7a–d show the single and two Au NRs’ spatial distribution of the near-field embedded in the complete TiO2 and with the 20% porous TiO2 medium. The color bar represents the intensity of the Au NRs’ near-field; one can observe the high-intensity variation between the single (23.75) and the two Au NRs with 10 nm spacing (83.72), and with 20% porosity the near-field intensities are reduced to 14.10 and 63.89, respectively. The surface plasmons’ near-field intensity is maximum around the NR (Fig. 7a), and decreases exponentially from the NR's surface, as shown in Fig. 8. These calculations demonstrate the high near-field intensity between the two Au NRs, which is an advantage for the photocurrent enhancement at longer wavelengths in comparison to Au NPs. This gives an idea of the NR concentration effect in the optical field enhancement, as the distance between the NRs will change with the NR concentration modification in the TiO2 photoanode. The Au NRs embedded in porous TiO2 media act as a subwavelength antenna to concentrate the incident light on the metal surface and produce a strong near-field, which will have higher magnitudes than the far-field incident light. The generated near-field around and at the edges of the NRs can help in the absorption enhancement of the dye molecules, which we have observed experimentally in this study.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the effect of the Au NRs’ LSPR on the photovoltaic performance of Y123 DSSCs. A strong Au NR concentration-dependent device performance is observed; nearly 26.42% JSC and 66.85% PCE are achieved with the optimization of the Au NR concentration (1.8 wt%) in comparison to the DSSC without Au NRs due to the light harvesting efficiency improvement. The device performance with the Au NRs was also verified by impedance analysis; an increase in the charge carrier transport and a reduction in the recombination resistance at the TiO2/Au NRs/dye interface was observed with the optimized NR concentration. We have also demonstrated the advantage of the Au NRs’ longitudinal LSPR (shape effect) in device performance enhancements in comparison to simple dipolar LSPR from the Au NPs, due to strong enhancements of the photocurrent response at longer wavelengths. The extinction efficiency and near-field distribution in the TiO2 medium without and with porosity were theoretically estimated to support experimental observations. These observations are useful for improving/understanding the light absorption in wider wavelength ranges for organic, perovskite and any other thin film solar cell by tuning the aspect ratio and concentration of any plasmonic metal nanorod.
