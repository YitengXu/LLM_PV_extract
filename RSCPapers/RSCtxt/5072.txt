    , Accepted 18th December 2022First published on 19th December 2022AbstractThe mass transfer efficiency and structural stability of the electrode are critical for industrialized water electrolysis operations. Herein, the biomimicry-inspired design of Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF nanoarrays with a fish scale-like structure, which endowed the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF nanoarrays with rapid infiltration of aqueous solution within 60 ms and 169° bubble contact angle, is demonstrated. The optimal Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample displayed catalytic activity with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotentials of only 48 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 102 mV at 100 mA cm−2. Similarly, the overpotential of the anodic-coupled urea oxidation reaction (UOR) was only 1.3 V at 10 mA cm−2 and 1.35 V at 100 mA cm−2. Besides, the small impact resulting from the rapid bubble extraction within the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF nanoarrays ensured excellent HER cycling stability over 100 h at a current density of 50 mA cm−2. The further scale-up experiment suggests the industrialization prospects of the prepared Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF electrocatalysts.
1. Introduction
Although various catalysts with high intrinsic activity have been developed for water electrolysis operations, these practices have posed further requirements on the top of the enhanced intrinsic activities. At present, Nafion hydrophobic binder is often used in preparing the powder catalytic materials into electrocatalysts, and the performance tests in the laboratory are usually carried out at low current densities. However, the hydrophobic binder reduced the surface energy of the electrode and hindered mass transport during the electrocatalytic processes. Sequentially, this caused difficulties in gas escape under the condition of high current densities. As a result, the overpotentials of the catalysts were greatly increased, mainly attributed to the bubble ohmic overpotential.1–4 In addition, at the potential required for industrial water electrolysis, the commonly used carbon-based catalysts suffered from decaying performance and carbon corrosion. In this aspect, the impact of bubbles can be blamed for the detachment of the active substance, which significantly reduced the cycling stability of the catalysts.5,6 Therefore, it becomes crucial to design and prepare binder-free self-supporting catalytic materials with high mass transfer efficiency and high catalytic activity for industrial water electrolysis.
Provided the fact that the catalytic reactions occur at the gas–liquid–solid three-phase contact, both the wetting ability of the electrolyte at the three-phase interface and the releasing rate of bubbles will significantly affect the activities of the catalysts. The strong gas adhesion to the employed catalyst will cause difficulties in gas escape and electrolyte diffusion. In turn, this will lead to the deactivation of the active sites on the electrode surface.7–9 As demonstrated by Iwata et al.,1 the wettability of the catalyst materials being studied can be transformed from superhydrophilic to superhydrophobic by covering the hydrophilic surface with different amounts of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). As a result, different bubble growth and detachment patterns were observed along with the changes in the wettability of the catalysts being studied. Accordingly, the overpotentials of the catalyst materials increased with the increasing bubble deviation diameter, the thickness of the bubble layer, and the coverage on the catalyst surfaces. Clearly, the improvement of the catalyst wettability can be a solution for the enhancement of the catalytic performance. In the literature, the construction of the hierarchical array structure on a flat substrate has been indicated to favor the infiltration of electrolytes, desorption of gases, and mass transport.10–15 For example, Liang et al.16 prepared a nanowire array (NixFe1−x-AHNAs) catalytic material with a core–shell structure on the surface of nickel foam (NF) by a one-step chemical deposition method under the action of a magnetic field. The hierarchical nanoarray structure reduced the contact area between the bubbles and the electrode so that the gas–liquid–solid three-phase contact angle of the catalytic material increased by 27.7°, and the gas repellency of the material improved. With the enhanced mass transfer efficiency, the optimal NixFe1−x-AHNAs-based electrode sample achieved a large current density of 1000 mA cm−2 at an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 258 mV. Apparently, hierarchical array structure can reduce the overpotential of the catalytic process by improving the wettability of the catalyst material.
In addition to that, the hierarchical array structure has also been proven to improve catalytic activities by promoting mass transfer efficiencies.17,18 Specifically, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) is an important measure of catalytic activity. Given the close connection of the catalytic activity to the density of active sites as well as surface features, a higher ESCA can expose more electrocatalytic active sites. This explains why the hierarchical structure will have enhanced the catalytic activity. Moreover, adjusting the electronic structures through heteroatom doping,19–23 defect induction,24–27 and heterostructure28–31 have also been experimentally demonstrated to improve the catalytic activity of the catalyst. For instance, Wu et al.32 anchored porous Ni2P/NiCoP heterostructure nanoarrays with rich grain boundaries on NF substrate through hydrothermal acid etching and static gas-phase phosphating processes. Based on the Kirkendall effect, the heterogeneous interfaces optimized the transfer of electrons and achieved the synergistic effect of hierarchical structure and adjustment of the electronic structure. The obtained catalyst sample exhibited excellent catalytic activity for both HER and UOR. However, the poor cycling stability was increased due to the easy conversion from phosphides to hydroxides as well as the reduction of nanoparticles during the catalytic process.33,34 Despite those achievements, a more rational design of the catalysts is necessary to further enhance the cycling stability. It has been noticed that transition-state metal nitrides are simultaneously controlled by covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds, where M–N bonds lead to the expansion of the parent metal lattice and contraction of the metal d-band. Such defects and higher density of states (DOS) of the d-bands of metals near the Fermi level allow noble-metal-like behavior in electrocatalysis and ensure good adsorption between the catalyst surface and reactants. Therefore, transition-state metal nitrides display unique electronic structures, high electrical conductivity, electrocatalytic activity, and more importantly, excellent mechanical/chemical stability.35–38
Inspired by biomimicry, in this work, we prepared a fish scale-like Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF nanoarrays with both superhydrophilic and superaerophobic properties. Specifically, by utilizing the Kirkendall effect of atomic diffusion during nitridation, the Ni3N nanoparticles with edge Schottky heterostructures were integrated into the FeNi3N nanosheets through Fe-doping. The obtained hierarchical structure was able to accelerate the infiltration of the electrolyte and weaken the adhesion of the gas during the electrocatalytic process. As a result, the mass transfer capacity of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF catalyst sample was effectively improved while maintaining sufficient ECSA. The in situ-grown structure together with the characteristics of nitrides endowed the catalyst material with excellent HER cycling stability up to 100 h at 50 mA cm−2. The well-retained catalytic performance during the scale-up experiments suggested a good commercialization prospect for the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF catalyst.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Ferric nitrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), potassium hydroxide (KOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and urea (CH4N2O) were purchased from China Aladdin Chemical Co., Ltd. All chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. All experimental solutions were prepared using Milli-Q ultrapure water (18.2 MU cm) Milli-Q, Millipore system.
2.2. Pre-treatment of the nickel form (NF)
The nickel foam with a size of 2 cm × 3 cm was immersed in a 3 M HCl solution for sonication for 15 min to remove the oxides on the surface. The treated nickel foam was washed with ultrapure water and ethanol in turn, and then vacuum-dried at 60 °C.
2.3. Preparation of the Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF sample
The treated NF was soaked in 20 mL of dilute HCl (3.6 × 10−3 M HCl) solution, and add 0.03 mmol Fe(NO3)3·9H2O to form a mixed solution. The mixed solution was transferred to a 100 mL reaction kettle at 100 °C and reacted for 20 h. After the reaction, it was washed with ultrapure water and dried under vacuum at 60 °C.
2.4. Preparation of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample
The prepared Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF was placed on the top of the porcelain boat and placed in a tube furnace, and the air in the tube furnace was completely discharged with N2 purge for 15 min, then, NH3 was introduced for 15 min, and the gas velocity of NH3 was stabilized at 20 mL min−1, and then heated to 350/400/450/500 °C at 10 °C min−1 for 60 min. The prepared samples were labeled as NiFeN/NF-350, Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF, NiFeN/NF-450, and NiFeN/NF-500, respectively.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 illustrates the preparation process of the hierarchically structured Ni3N nanoparticles, FeNi3N nanosheets, and the NF substrate samples. First, ultrathin Fe-doped Ni(OH)2 nanosheets were grown on the flat NFs by an in situ acid etching method, and then Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF was formed by nitridation in an ammonia atmosphere (Fig. S1†). Fig. 1b–j shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the prepared samples. As seen, the flat NF substrate in Fig. 1b–d allows the growth of uniform and dense fish scale-like nanoarrays after the in situ acid etching treatment (Fig. 1e–g). The number of layers and thickness of these nanoarrays decreased with the increasing nitridation temperature and completely disappeared at 500 °C (Fig. S2† and Fig. 1h–j). That is, the layer number and thickness of the nanoarrays can be regulated through the corrosive effect of ammonia nitridation on the Fe–Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. Inspired by biomimicry, those fish scale-like nanoarrays might have both superhydrophilic and superaerophobic properties.

In the process of water electrolysis, the bubbles generated at the contact interface between the electrode surface and the electrolyte are to be detached timely. Or else, the bubbles covering the area will become a dead zone and seriously hinder any further contact of the reactant with the active sites. Furthermore, such an effect is more severe for electrodes with faster reaction kinetics along with faster bubble formation.2 In our experiments, the surface topography, surface aerophobicity, and wettability of the prepared samples were analyzed to understand their individual ability toward bubble detachment and liquid infiltration. As distinguished by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique, the surface of the NF substrate is relatively smooth, while the Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF and Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample surfaces have abundant fish scale-like nanoarrays. After nitridation, the thickness of nanoarrays dropped from 82 nm on the Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF sample down to 32 nm on the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample.
The individual surface aerophobicity of the prepared samples was investigated by the bubble contact angle (CA) test. As shown in Fig. 2a–c, the underwater CA of the NF substrate, Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF and Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF samples are 108°, 135°, and 169°, respectively. This indicates that the fish scale-like nanoarrays can effectively improve the surface gas repellency of the samples, which certainly will depend on their thicknesses. By referring to the definition of a superaerophobic surface with a CA greater than 150°,39,40 the catalyst surface can be endowed with surface superaerophobic properties by growing the fish scale-like nanoarrays with a thickness of about 32 nm. As illustrated in Fig. 2d–f, this feature can be attributed to the hierarchical structure at the micro- and nanoscale through the reduction of the contact area between the bubbles and the electrode surface. Such discontinued three-phase contact areas will lead to low interfacial adhesion and promote the detachment of gas bubbles.

To shed light on the advantages of fish scale-like nanoarrays in water electrolysis operations, the hydrogen evolution on the surface of the prepared catalysts was recorded by a digital camera during the HER process (Videos 1–3†). Fig. 2g–i show the HER processes of the NF, Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF, and Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF samples at a current density of 50 mA cm−2. As observed, a large number of H2 bubbles adhere to the surface of the NF sample, while there are much fewer bubbles on the surface of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample. The Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF sample displayed the intermediate situation. This observation is consistent with the CA testing results that H2 bubbles can be detached timely from the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample surface with gas-repellent properties and a better mass transfer capability.

Fig. 3 provides the respective wettability of the prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 3a, no obvious changes are observed within 20 s after the droplets were added to the surface of the NF sample, while it takes about 2.5 s for water to be absorbed by the surface of the Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF sample (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the droplet is absorbed by the surface of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample nearly instantaneously (<60 ms) (Fig. 3c). This confirms the super hydrophilic property on the surface of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample. However, the hydrophilic and air-repellent properties of fish scale-like nanoarrays seem dimension-dependent, and the higher surface energy is favorable to water infiltration. The superhydrophilic surface of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample allows water to infiltrate the nanoarrays and even the pores to form a wetting layer, which further hinders the adhesion of bubbles. In the process of water electrolysis, the aqueous solution will rapidly diffuse and wet the gas-generating area on the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF electrode surface due to its super-hydrophilicity. As reported, the accelerated detachment of bubbles is very beneficial for the efficiency of water electrolysis.41 Through the amplitude and frequency of current oscillation, we can predict the desorption size and velocity of bubbles in the HER process.1 To probe the effect of hydrophilic and gas-repellent properties on the mass transfer process, high-current chronopotentiometry (CP) tests were conducted. As shown in Fig. S3,† the superhydrophilic/superaerophobic Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample showed a smaller amplitude and a higher frequency compared to the NF sample, which proves that bubbles can rapidly detach from the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF catalyst surface. This conclusion agrees very well with the foregoing. Clearly, the bubble-release behavior of the applied HER electrodes directly affects the mass transfer efficiency and overall water splitting. The fast release of the gas bubbles will ensure the continuous exposure of active sites and enable a consistent ECSA during the catalysis process without decay. In such a case, the buoyancy of the bubbles is sufficient to overcome the adhesion force generated by the extremely small contact area between the bubbles and the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF electrode surface. Again, the superhydrophilic and superaerophobic properties of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF electrode allowed the quick release of the generated bubbles, which in turn minimized the catalytic dead space and reduced the loss of ECSA with a rapid mass transfer.

Fig. S4a† shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Ni(OH)2/NF and Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF samples. In addition to the main diffraction peaks of NF positioned at 44.2, 51.6, and 76.2°, the characteristic diffraction peaks of Ni(OH)2 (PDF #14-0117) can be observed in both samples. As shown in Fig. S4b,† after Fe-doping, the XRD diffraction peak associated with the (110) crystal plane of Ni(OH)2 shifts to a lower angle, which indicates that Fe ions have entered the crystal structure of the Ni(OH)2 compound. The effect of different nitridation temperatures on the crystal structure of the samples was further studied. As shown in Fig. S4b,† apart from the characteristics of the Ni(OH)2 compound derived from the precursor Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF, the diffraction peaks of Ni3N (PDF #10-0280) also appear. This implies that nitridation had begun at the temperature of 350 °C but the nitridation was not sufficient. At 450 °C, the diffraction peaks belong to the FeNi3N (PDF #50-1434) species. As for the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample with an intermediate temperature of 400 °C, the main diffraction peaks can be well assigned to the two crystal structures of Ni3N42 and FeNi3N43 (Fig. 4a and b), which indicates that the obtained sample at this temperature is the Ni3N/FeNi3N hybrid.

From the low magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Fig. 4c and d, many dark nanoparticles can be observed embedded in the porous structure of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample. Meanwhile, an obvious heterointerface becomes visible from the HR-TEM images in Fig. 4e and f. After the measurement of the lattice fringes, the dark and light regions correspond to the (111) crystal plane of Ni3N and the (220) crystal plane of FeNi3N, respectively. Specifically, the surface-embedded nanoparticles are Ni3N and the porous nanosheets are FeNi3N. This is because the Ni and Fe ions are reduced and diffused outward in the process of ammonia nitridation. The relatively smaller radius of the Ni atom resulted in a larger diffusion activation energy (Ea) compared to that of the Fe atom. According to the Arrhenius equation D = D0exp(−Ea/RT), the differentiated diffusion rates between Ni and Fe atoms led to the “separation” of Ni3N nanoparticles and FeNi3N nanosheets. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample in Fig. S5a† shows four concentric rings, which are ascribed to the (220)/(311) planes of FeNi3N and the (110)/(112) planes of Ni3N planes, respectively. This result is in good agreement with that of the XRD analysis. The energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) results of the Ni3N/FeNi3N sample in Fig. S5b† confirmed the presence of N, Fe, and Ni three elements in the composite electrode. The elemental mapping images in Fig. S5c–f† revealed the distribution of Ni, Fe, and N phases. Obviously, the distribution of Ni and N is more uniform compared to the Fe element, and this further proves that the distribution of Fe and Ni is inconsistent due to the Kirkendall effect.
The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample are shown in Fig. 4g. Typical type IV profiles imply a mesoporous structure, which is also supported by the results in both Fig. 4g–i and Fig. S6.† Although the pore size distribution indicates a pore size range of 3–9 nm, most of the pores are centered around 4 nm within the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample structure. In comparison with the Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF, NF–N, and NF samples, the porous Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample with a larger surface area and more active sites are expected to have faster infiltration and storage of electrolytes, as well as a faster mass transfer efficiency.
The surface chemical state of the developed catalysts was further studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The high-resolution XPS Ni 2p3/2 spectrum in Fig. S7a† shows three spin–orbit peaks of Ni2+ (855.7 eV), Ni1+ (854.2), and Ni0 (853.6 eV) as well as one satellite peak from the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample. The presence of Ni0 endows the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample with some metallic properties,44 which are conducive to fast electron transport and improved electrocatalytic performance.45 Referring to the Ni 2p3/2 of the standard Ni3N compound with Ni2+ at 855.0 eV, Ni1+ at 853.3 eV, and Ni0 at 852.4 eV,46,47 all the Ni 2p3/2 peaks in the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample shift to the higher binding energies. This suggests the occurrence of electron loss and an increased overall oxidation state. The high-resolution Fe 2p XPS spectrum of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample is shown in Fig. S7b.† The two characteristic peaks at 704.7 and 721.4 eV can be assigned to Fe0. In comparison with the reported binding energies of Fe 2p3/2 (about 711 eV) and Fe0 (about 707 eV) in the literature,48–51 all the Fe 2p peaks in the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample shift towards the lower binding energies. This reflects the electron gain and the decreased overall oxidation state. Meanwhile, the appearances of the two Fe3+ peaks at 723.7 eV and 711.7 eV as well as the Ni2+ peak resulted from the inevitable oxidation of the catalyst surface.52
Although anodic oxygen evolution is not harmful to the environment, the higher driving potential (1.23 V) caused by its slow kinetics directly increases energy consumption.53 Alternatively, low-cost hydrogen production and wastewater treatment can simultaneously be realized by coupling the HER at the cathode with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) at the anode. In our experimental electrolysis, the 0.33 M urea was chosen to simulate wastewater treatment since human urine contains 2–2.5% urea by weight (approximately equal to 0.33 M). The electrochemical performance of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample was tested using a standard three-electrode system at ambient temperature. Fig. S8a† shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the HER tested in 1 M KOH, 0.33 M urea (urea) aqueous solution, and 1 M KOH + 0.33 M urea solution, respectively. As seen, only the negligible current response appears in the 0.33 M urea. The identical electrocatalytic performances of the samples in both 1 M KOH + 0.33 M and 1 M KOH indicate that urea does not participate in the reaction and has no effect on the HER catalytic process. After screening the samples in Fig. S9a,† the properties of the prepared samples including NF, NF–N, Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF, Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF, and Pt/C are compared in Fig. 5a. Clearly, the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample exhibits the highest catalytic activity after the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The overpotentials of Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF are only 48 and 102 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 5b, they are much smaller than those from the other samples of Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF (128 mV/226 mV), NF–N (136 mV/295 mV) and NF (179 mV/336 mV), respectively. It is noticed that the potential required by the Pt/C sample at 200 mA cm−2 exceeds that of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample, which suggests that the catalytic performance of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample is better than that of the Pt/C sample at high potentials. This is due to the fact that the mass transfer efficiency has a great influence on the overpotential at high current densities. From the perspective of improving thermodynamic and electrochemical kinetic activity, the high mass transfer efficiency brought by the superhydrophilicity and superaerophobicity enables the active sites on the surface of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample to rapidly release bubbles and contact the electrolyte after each catalytic cycle. This prevents the ECSA from being masked, so the overpotential of all current regions is reduced. This is evidenced by the higher slope of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample in the LSV curve compared to other samples.3,54Fig. 5c shows that the Tafel slope of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample is only 55 mV dec−1, which is smaller than those from the NF (217 mV dec−1), NF–N (238 mV dec−1) and Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF (94 mV dec−1) samples. This suggests that the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample is more conducive to the HER Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism. Fig. 5d and Fig. S10a† depict the fitted Nyquist plots of the prepared samples. The semicircle diameter in the mid-low frequency region represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the interface between the catalyst sample and the electrolyte. A smaller Rct from the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample implies good charge transfer kinetics and a faster HER rate, which is consistent with the Tafel slope results. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was calculated from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at different scan rates (Fig. S11 and S12†), and the ECSA of the individual sample was evaluated based on this. The significantly larger Cdl of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample in Fig. 5e and Fig. S13a† indicates that the higher specific surface area and more active sites within the heterostructures contribute to a larger ECSA for the catalytic processes.

The prepared samples were subjected to continuous chronopotentiodynamic (CP) testing at a current density of 50 mA cm−2 for 100 h. Fig. 5f shows the LSV curves of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample before and after the stability test. The potential increases by only 15 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm−2 after 100 h, which suggests good structural stability of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample (Fig. 5g and Fig. S14†). In contrast, the current density of the Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF sample decreases rapidly during H2 production. This is due to the exfoliation of the catalyst particles from the conductive substrate during long-term operation and the loss of active sites (Fig. S15†). As shown in Table S1† and Fig. 5h, the HER performance of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample is superior to that of non-noble metal catalysts reported in recent years.
For the UOR anodic reaction, the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample displays a lower onset potential in 1 M KOH + 0.33 M urea than in 1 M KOH, and there was no apparent current response in 0.33 M urea solution (Fig. S8b†). Notably, the potential of the UOR reaction was 1.4 V at a current density of 300 mA cm−2, which did not reach the onset potential for OER to occur. After the similar screening in Fig. S9b,† the UOR LSV curves were recorded on the prepared samples of NF, NF–N, Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF, Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF, and IrO2. It can be seen from Fig. 6a that the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample displays the best UOR catalytic performance. Meanwhile, a special “oxidation peak” can be observed from the IrO2 and NF–N samples, which is due to the fact that UOR only occurs on those two samples in the first half of LSV, and OER can occur when the onset potential reaches afterward. The competition between the UOR and OER triggers the current density decay in region.55 The Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample only needed 1.3 V and 1.35 V to reach current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, which are significantly lower than those for other samples (Fig. 6b). Fig. 6c shows the fitted slope of the Tafel curves in the Faraday region. Clearly, the Tafel slope of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample (51 mV dec−1) is smaller than that of other samples, 58 mV dec−1 (Fe–Ni(OH)2/NF), 73 mV dec−1 (NF–N), and 112 mV dec−1 (NF). This provides the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample with faster UOR process kinetics. Fig. 6d and Fig. S10b† depict the fitted Nyquist plots of the prepared catalyst samples. Unlike the other samples, the Nyquist plot of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample consists of two semi-circles, where the resistance R1 at higher frequencies is related to the interfacial resistance,56–60 while the lower frequency depends on the Rct. In addition, the constant-phase elements CPE1 and CPE2 both represent Cdl, and the Nyquist plot further proves that the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample has the characteristics of porosity and heterostructure. Meanwhile, the second semicircle can also prove that the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample has a smaller Rct, good charge transfer kinetics, and a faster UOR rate. The ECSA values of the prepared samples are derived from the integral Cdl CV areas in Fig. S16 and S17.† As shown in Fig. S13b† and Fig. 6e, the Cdl of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample reaches 26.58 mF cm−2, which is much higher than that of other samples, and the constructed hierarchical structures provided more active sites. As shown in Table S2† and Fig. 6f, the UOR performance of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample is superior to that of non-noble metal catalysts reported in recent years.

(f) The overpotentials of Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF reaching 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2 are compared with those of recently reported representative electrocatalysts. 
Surface charge distribution plays an important role in catalytic activity, and according to solid band theory, electron transfer behavior is closely related to the work function of the material. To further explore the role of heterostructures in enhancing UOR kinetics, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) tests were performed on the prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, the work functions of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF and FeNi3N/NF (NiFeN/NF-450) samples are 7.12 and 7.97, respectively. This indicates that the work function is improved with the decrease of Ni3N content and the increase of FeNi3N content. Thus, FeNi3N and Ni3N meet the basic conditions to form a Schottky barrier, which proves that there is a Schottky heterostructure at the interface between the nanoparticle and the nanosheet. When the two substances are in contact, the electronic structures of Ni and Fe centers are significantly tuned due to the self-driven electron transfer at the interface of Ni3N/FeNi3N nanoheterostructures. Specifically, the electrons will spontaneously transfer from Ni3N to the FeNi3N phase. In comparison with the XPS results of Fe-doped and undoped catalyst samples, the increased binding energy of Ni 2p3/2 and decreased binding energy of Fe 2p3/2 suggest the transfer of electrons from Ni to Fe element. Thereby, the electrophilic Ni3N region and the nucleophilic FeNi3N region are formed accordingly (Fig. 7c and d). When the UOR occurs, the electron-accepting carbonyl group will be attracted to the FeNi3N side due to the electrostatic interaction, while the electron-donating amino group is easily attracted to the Ni3N side. The interaction between Ni3N and FeNi3N phase can promote the breakage of the C–N bond and accelerate the decomposition of urea to generate CO2 and N2. Therefore, the Ni3N/FeNi3N heterointerface formed by Fe-doping is very beneficial to improve UOR activity and accelerating UOR kinetics (Fig. 7e). In addition, this Schottky heterostructure has also been reported to promote the hydrogen evolution process.61,62

In order to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample in the total hydrolysis of urea and water under “real conditions”, the prepared catalyst samples were assembled into symmetrical electrodes for the total hydrolysis. Fig. S18a† shows the LSV curves of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample derived from the bi-electrode cell tests. Clearly, the coupled HER/UOR has a faster current response at 100 mA cm−2 compared to the conventional HER/OER reaction occurring in 1 M KOH. The difference of 343 mV at 100 mA cm−2 proves that the coupled UOR/HER reaction can significantly reduce energy consumption during wastewater treatment. Fig. S18b† collects the gas produced by the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample during the hydrogen evolution process to assess the faradaic efficiency. As shown in Fig. S18c,† the assembled cell produced 10.2 mL of H2 at 50 mA cm−2 for 30 min with a faradaic efficiency close to 100%. Additionally, Fig. S18d and e† illustrates that the assembled Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF electrodes can incorporate renewable energies such as wind and solar energy to be used as power resources during the electrolysis of the 1.0 M KOH + 0.33 M urea solution. More importantly, as shown in Fig. S18f,† the well-maintained structural stability of the prepared Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF electrode in the scale-up experiments suggests a promising commercialization potential.
4. Conclusions
In this work, a Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF catalytic material with a hierarchical structure was prepared by regulating the surface structure and catalyst composition. The HER overpotentials of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample are only 48 and 102 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. Meanwhile, the anodic-coupled UORs of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample are only 1.3 V and 1.35 V. The Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF sample can maintain the HER activity stably for 100 h at a current density of 50 mA cm−2. This is due to several aspects: (a) the fish scale-like Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF nanoarrays with the superhydrophilic and superaerophobic properties reduced the gas–solid contact area and made the three-phase contact area discontinuous. The mass transfer process was facilitated by promoting the infiltration of electrolytes and ensuring the rapid release of air bubbles. (b) Based on the Kirkendall effect, the Fe-doping constructed abundant grain boundaries on the nanoarrays in the nitridation process, which greatly increased the electrochemically active area of the electrode material. (c) A Schottky heterostructure with excellent intrinsic catalytic activity was constructed by adjusting the electronic structures of Ni3N and FeNi3N on both sides of the heterostructure. (d) The excellent cycling stability of the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF catalyst sample is attributed to the rapid release of bubbles and the high structural stability of nitrides. The later scale-up experiments showed that the Ni3N/FeNi3N/NF catalyst material has a good industrialization prospect.
