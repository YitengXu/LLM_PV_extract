    , Accepted 20th February 2016First published on 22nd February 2016AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) with organic small molecules as hole transport materials (HTMs) have attracted considerable attention due to their power conversion efficiencies as high as 20%. In the present work, three new spiro-type hole transport materials with spiro-cores, i.e. Spiro-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3, are investigated by using density functional theory combined with the Marcus theory and Einstein relation. Based on the calculated and experimental highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of 30 reference molecules, an empirical equation, which can predict the HOMO levels of hole transport materials accurately, is proposed. Moreover, a simplified method, in which the hole transport pathways are simplified to be one-dimensional, is presented and adopted to qualitatively compare the molecular hole mobilities. The calculated results show that the perovskite solar cells with the new hole transport materials can have higher open-circuit voltages due to the lower HOMO levels of Spiro-F1 (−5.31 eV), Spiro-F2 (−5.42 eV) and Spiro-F3 (−5.10 eV) compared with that of Spiro-OMeTAD (−5.09 eV). Furthermore, the hole mobilities of Spiro-F1 (1.75 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) and Spiro-F3 (7.59 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) are 3.1 and 1.4 times that of Spiro-OMeTAD (5.65 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) respectively, due to small reorganization energies and large transfer integrals. Interestingly, the stability properties of Spiro-F1 and Spiro-F2 are shown to be comparable to that of Spiro-OMeTAD, and the dimers of Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3 possess better stability than that of Spiro-OMeTAD. Taking into consideration the appropriate HOMO level, improved hole mobility and enhanced stability, Spiro-F1 and Spiro-F3 may become the most promising alternatives to Spiro-OMeTAD. The present work offers a new design strategy and reliable calculation methods towards the development of excellent organic small molecules as HTMs for highly efficient and stable PSCs.
Introduction
Since the 2012 report on an all solid state perovskite solar cell (PSC) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7%, employing the hole transport material (HTM) 2,2-7.7-tetrakis(N,N′-diparamethoxy-phenyl-amine 9,9′-spirobifluorene) (Spiro-OMeTAD) and light harvester CH3NH3PbI3,1 and since the dissolution shortcoming of CH3NH3PbI3 using a liquid state electrolyte was overcome in two breakthrough studies in 2009 and 2011,2,3 there has been a surge of interest in PSCs due to their easy fabrication and superb photoelectric properties in both mesoscopic and planar structures.4–6 Up to now, PSCs using the light harvester H2NCHNH2PbI3, that combine the promise of solution processing with the ability to tailor the band gap through chemical substitution, have yielded PCEs as high as 20.1%,7 which can compete with long-established photovoltaics, such as copper indium gallium selenide, silicon, cadmium telluride, and so on.8 To date, one popular device configuration of PSCs consists of a multilayer stack of transparent electrode/electron-transporting material (ETM)/perovskite/HTM/metal, while another consists of transparent electrode/HTM/perovskite/ETM/metal, which has been called an inverted perovskite solar cell.9,10
For PSCs, subsequent studies have pointed out that the HTMs play an important role in increasing the short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage, retarding the charge recombination process, and controlling the long-term stability in air.11–13 With the rapid increase in the PCE associated with the evolution of different types of perovskites and device fabrication techniques, various HTMs including polymers, organic small molecules and inorganic semiconductor materials have been developed.14 At present, the amorphous Spiro-OMeTAD is still the most efficient organic small molecule HTM in PSCs, which has been widely investigated due to good film-forming performance, good solubility in organic solvents, an electronic energy level well matched to the perovskite light absorbing layers, and a weak absorption in the visible light region.15,16 However, the synthesis of Spiro-OMeTAD is relatively expensive due to harsh synthetic conditions, such as low temperature, multiple steps and aggressive or sensitive reagents, and it has low hole mobility, which results in large interfacial recombination loss.17,18 Therefore, searching for potential HTMs that are low cost and possess high hole mobility, a matched energy level to the valence band of perovskite and good photochemical stability is significant and challenging work, at the present stage.
Recently, a number of HTMs possessing a spiro-type conformation have been incorporated and developed in PSCs. For example, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Spiro-OMeTAD has been tuned by altering the position of methoxy ethers on the amino phenyl motifs, and an overall PCE of 16.7% was obtained for a PSC containing po-Spiro-OMeTAD.19 Subsequently, Walsh and co-workers predicted the ionization potentials of Spiro-OMeTAD and twelve methoxy isomers and polymethoxy derivatives by using density functional theory (DFT).20 Their results indicate that the ionization potentials of HTMs can be affected by the energy of the π system and the position of substituent groups. In 2015, Nazeeruddin and co-workers developed a cost-effective spiro-type 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(2H,2′H,4H,4′H-3,3′-spiro-bi[thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine]-6,6′,8,8′-tetrayl)tetrakis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) HTM (PST1), and the PSC based on PST1 yielded a PCE of 13.44%. Meanwhile, they also obtained the crystal structure of Spiro-OMeTAD for the first time.21 In addition, 4,4′-spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene] including spiro-thiophene was reported and introduced into PSCs as a HTM by Tu and co-workers, and the device exhibited an overall PCE of 10.4%.22
Apart from spiro-type HTMs, other organic small molecule HTMs without the spiro-unit have also been explored in PSCs, such as 2,2′,5,5′-tet-rakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-3,3′-bithiophene (KTM3),23 4-(4-phenyl-4-a-naphthylbutadienyl)-N,N-di(4-tolyl)-phenylamine (HTM1), 4-(4-phenyl-4-a-naphthylbutadienyl)-N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)-phenylamine (HTM2),24 tris[bis(4-methoxyphenylethenyl)-N-phenyl]amine (TPA-MeOPh), tris[bis(4-methoxyphenylethenyl)-N-phenyl]amine quinolizino acridine,25 1,2-bis[3,6-(4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamino)-9H-carbazol-9-methyl]benze (V886),26 and so on. However, PSCs based on these materials show lower PCEs compared with PSCs based on Spiro-OMeTAD. Consequently, further development of new spiro-type HTMs is an advisable and effective way to increase the PCE of devices.
In the present work, three new spiro-type organic small molecules (see Fig. 1) are investigated as HTMs by using DFT combined with the Marcus theory and molecular dynamics simulations. The potential HTM candidates were selected due to the matching of their HOMO levels with the valence band energy of perovskite, good stability and higher hole mobility compared with Spiro-OMeTAD.

Computational methods
The geometries of all investigated molecules are relaxed to their potential energy minimum at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in dichloromethane solvent, based on the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM).27 All calculations are performed using Gaussian 09 code.28
The Marcus theory with the hopping model is employed to describe the hole transport behaviour. The charge hopping rate (k) is expressed as:29  where kB represents the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and h denotes the Planck constant. λ represents the reorganization energy, which is calculated by using the adiabatic potential energy surface method.30,31 In this work, only internal reorganization energy is considered. The reorganization energy can be expressed as follows:32  where  and  represent the total energies of cationic and neutral species with the geometries of the neutral and cationic species, respectively. E+ and E0 are the total energies of the cationic and neutral molecules in their lowest energy geometries, respectively.

v denotes the transfer integral, which is obtained by adopting a direct approach33 at the M06-2X/6-31G(d,p) level.34 In our work, v can be written as:v = 〈ΨHOMOi|F|ΨHOMOf〉where ΨHOMOi and ΨHOMOf represent the HOMOs of the isolated molecules 1 and 2. F is the Fock operator for the dimer, which can be calculated as:F = SCεC−1
The Kohn-Sham orbital C and eigenvalue ε are evaluated by diagonalizing the zeroth-order Fock matrix. S denotes the overlap matrix for the dimer.
The hole mobilities of the investigated molecules are calculated by using the Einstein relation:35,36  where n represents the spatial dimensionality and is 1 in our work, I is a selected hopping pathway, ri is the charge hopping centroid to centroid distance, and ki denotes the charge hopping rate. Pi is defined as the hopping probability, which can be obtained using:  
Results and discussion
Electronic structure
Spiro-OMeTAD and the three designed spiro-type molecules are shown in Fig. 1. To gain insight into their electronic structure, the HOMOs and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the four molecules are investigated and are presented in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Illustration of the frontier molecular orbitals for all investigated molecules at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. 
In π conjugated oligomers and polymers, it has been found that the more delocalized frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) promote faster carrier transport by reducing the intramolecular reorganization energy and increasing the transfer integrals of adjacent molecules in the crystal structure or dimer.37 However, caution must be taken when applying this deduction to the swivel-cruciform spiro-core molecules, since the charge transport performance is related to many other factors such as the molecular packing and induced polarization.38 Here we check the FMO patterns to get some clues about the carrier transport capability. Detailed discussions about the hole mobility will be done according to further calculations below. As shown in Fig. 2, the FMO of Spiro-OMeTAD and Sprio-F1 have similar distribution pictures, where the HOMOs and LUMOs possess π-orbital characteristics. However, the HOMOs are delocalized over the whole molecule and the LUMOs are mainly located on the Spiro-unit. For the molecules Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3, although the LUMOs show a similar delocalization to that of Spiro-OMeTAD and Spiro-F1, this is not the case for the HOMOs. The HOMO of Spiro-F2 spreads over the whole molecular skeleton except the end-phenyl units, while the HOMO of Spiro-F3 is mainly located on the four methoxydiphenylamine units. As a whole, the distribution of HOMOs is more vast than that of the LUMOs for all the investigated molecules, which indicates that the hole transport performance for all the investigated molecules is better than the electron transport performance, making them potential hole transport materials. Based on the analysis of the HOMOs, Spiro-OMeTAD and Spiro-F1 may have better hole transport capacity than Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3.
In PSCs, the molecular HOMO level not only reflects the hole injection ability but also determines the open-circuit voltage of the device, because the open-circuit voltage is relative to the difference between the HOMO level of the HTM and the quasi-Fermi levels of TiO2 (theoretical photovoltage). A deeper HOMO level provides a higher open-circuit voltage. Therefore, obtaining a more accurate HOMO level is necessary to screen efficient HTMs. However, a number of studies have shown that the value of the molecular HOMO level calculated by the DFT-B3LYP method is overestimated.39,40 To improve the agreement of the calculated (HOMOa) with experimental HOMO level (HOMOexp), here, 30 molecules which have been synthesized and used in PSCs as HTMs lately,14,41–43 are selected as references and investigated at the DFT-B3LYP/6-31 g(d,p) level in dichloromethane solvent, based on the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM). The obtained HOMOa and HOMOexp of the 30 reference molecules are reported in Table S1.† As shown in Table S1,† our calculations overestimate the HOMO levels of the 30 reference molecules, and the amount of overestimation ranges from 0.50 to 0.81 eV. Furthermore, it can be seen from Fig. 3 that there is a good linear correlation between the HOMOa and HOMOexp, and the fitting empirical equation is expressed as follows:Y = 1.107X − 0.118 (R = 0.941)where X denotes HOMOa and Y is fitting the HOMO levels (HOMOb). The high correlation coefficient (R = 0.941) indicates that the empirical equation is suitable to describe the HOMOexp.
 Fig. 3  Theoretical and experimental HOMO levels of 30 reference molecules at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. 
To further verify the reliability of the equation, we collected the HOMO levels of another 10 molecules from the literature,44–48 which are not included in the above-mentioned 30 reference molecules. Then, we used the empirical equation to fit their HOMOb. Table S2† lists the fitting and experimental HOMO levels. The results show that the fitting HOMOb values are in agreement with the experimental values. The mean error is only 0.003 eV, which is much smaller than the absolute mean error of 0.624 eV. For the reference molecule Spiro-OMeTAD in our work, the fitting HOMOb is −5.09 eV, which is in good agreement with the experimental values of −5.00 to −5.22 eV.21,38,49,50 This further indicates that the above-mentioned empirical equation is reasonable and capable of evaluating the HOMO levels of phenylamine-type HTMs.
The HOMOa and fitting HOMOb levels of the investigated molecules, according to the above-empirical equation, are reported in Table 1. It is clear that the fitting HOMOb values of Spiro-F1 (−5.31 eV), Spiro-F2 (−5.42 eV) and Spiro-F3 (−5.10 eV) are revealed to be very comparable to that of Spiro-OMeTAD (−5.09 eV), and are well matched with that of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43) or CH3NH3PbBr3 (−5.90).50,51 What is more, the fitting HOMOb values of Sprio-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3 are 200, 300 and 10 meV lower than that of Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, which can assist in gaining a higher open-circuit voltage in PSCs.

To explore the effect of the HOMO levels of molecular fragments compared to that of the HOMOs of the corresponding molecules, we calculated the HOMO levels of the fragments at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. Fig. 4 shows the HOMO levels of the fragments and the corresponding molecules. F0, F1, F2 and F3 denote dimethoxyphenylamine, bismethoxyphenylaniline, bisdimethylfluorenylamino and methoxydiphenylamine moieties, respectively. From Fig. 4, we can see that a deeper HOMO level of a fragment gives rise to a lower HOMO level of the corresponding molecule except in the case of Spiro-F3. Additionally, the HOMO levels of the fragments are lower than that of the corresponding molecules for Spiro-OMeTAD, Spiro-F1 and Spiro-F2, while the HOMO levels of methoxydiphenylamine and Sprio-F3 are similar. The above phenomenon can be understood from the FMOs. The HOMOs of Spiro-OMeTAD, Spiro-F1 and Spiro-F2 are not only distributed on the fragments but also on the spiro-core, which increases the HOMO levels of the fragments. For Spiro-F3, the HOMO is only spread over four methoxydiphenylamine moieties, so the difference in the HOMO levels between the fragment and the molecule is very small. This result shows that the bismethoxyphenylaniline and bisdimethylfluorenylamino moieties play an important role in reducing the HOMO levels of the HTMs. Due to the deep HOMO levels, the new designed molecules may be promising HTMs for PSCs.

For HTMs, their HOMO level should be higher than the valence band of perovskite. In addition, the LUMO level should be higher than the conduction band of perovskite (such as CH3NH3PbI3, −3.93 eV) to block the electron transportation from perovskite to the metal electrodes. In our work, the LUMO levels are estimated by the expression of LUMO = HOMOb + E, where E is the excitation energy, which is calculated at the TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. In this way, the calculated LUMO level of Spiro-OMeTAD is −2.01 eV, which is in good agreement with the experimental LUMO level of −2.09 eV.21 Accordingly, the calculated LUMO levels of Spiro-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3 are −2.39, −2.55 and −2.38 eV, respectively, which are much higher than the conduction band of CH3NH3PbI3. Thus, the backflow of electrons can be effectively blocked in the case of Spiro-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3 being used as HTMs.
Exciton binding energy and charge transfer amount
To achieve efficient carrier (hole or electron) transport, the bound electron–hole pairs should be dissociated into fully separated positive and negative charges to escape from the coulomb attraction.52 Generally, the exciton binding energy (Eb) is the energy difference between the neutral exciton and the two free carriers.53 The Eb of the investigated molecules can be calculated according to the following equation: Eb = Eg − Ex = EH–L − E1.54,55 The ΔEH–L (energy difference between HOMO and LUMO) replaces the Eg (electron energy gap), and Ex (optical gap) can be approximated as the E1 (first singlet excitation energy). The E1 was calculated at the TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level based on the optimized geometry of the S1 state. According to the above mentioned relation, the calculated Eb values for Spiro-OMeTAD, Spiro-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3 are 0.88, 0.89, 0.86 and 0.41 eV, respectively. Obviously, Spiro-F1 and Spiro-F2 have similar Eb values compared with Spiro-OMeTAD, while the Eb of Spiro-F3 is about half that of Spiro-OMeTAD. This result implies that the electron–hole pair of Spiro-F3 can more easily dissociate into free charge carriers than those in the other three molecules.
Apart from Eb, the amount of charge transfer upon electronic transition can also reflect the coulomb attraction in electron–hole pairs. Generally, the larger the charge transfer is, the stronger the intramolecular charge transfer and the easier the dissociation of the exciton are. The calculated amount of transferred charge is 0.588, 0.798, 0.774 and 1.174 e for Spiro-OMeTAD, Spiro-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3, respectively, indicating that the exciton of Spiro-F3 has the strongest ability to break away from the coulomb attraction in all studied molecules. The excitons of Spiro-F1 and Spiro-F2 take the second place, and the coulomb attraction in the electron–hole pairs is strongest for Spiro-OMeTAD. The result is in approximate agreement with the Eb trend.
Hole mobility
Charge carrier transfer processes are very important and play a significant role in many physical chemistry processes.56 Just recently, our study showed that the hole mobility of a HTM may play a vital role in increasing the short-circuit current density of PSCs.57 In order to calculate the hole mobility, the reorganization energy between neutral and cationic states is an important parameter. It is well known that a lower reorganization energy implies a higher hole mobility.58
The calculated reorganization energies of Spiro-OMeTAD, Spiro-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3 are 0.131, 0.098, 0.072 and 0.119 eV, respectively, indicating that the three new designed molecules show smaller reorganization energies than that of Spiro-OMeTAD. Thus, Spiro-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3 may have better hole transport performance than Spiro-OMeTAD. According to the calculated reorganization energies, the hole mobility of the investigated molecules can be obtained using the Einstein relation.
However, to one's regret, a considerable number of studies have proved that the quantitative prediction of carrier mobility is a very challenging field,59–61 which is mainly due to deficient calculation methods. For instance, the method of describing charge transport is based on some sound approximations and assumptions. Based on the above mentioned bottleneck, only stable dimers of the investigated molecules are considered to qualitatively compare molecular hole mobility, as the most stable dimer can provide the largest transfer integral in all charge transfer pathways. In our calculations, we take Spiro-OMeTAD as a model and adopt the single crystal structure of Sprio-OMeTAD to generate all possible intermolecular hopping pathways (see Fig S1†). Table S3† lists the total electron energies and corresponding hole transfer integrals of all investigated pathways. Obviously the order of total electron energies is in agreement with the order of hole transfer integrals, which means that the more stable dimers have larger hole transfer integrals.
The experimental crystal structures of Sprio-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3 have not been reported. So we carried out the stable dimer prediction by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with quantum chemistry calculations. Stable molecular dimers were obtained through two steps. At first, to get the initial dimeric structures, 30 ps MD simulations were carried out at 298 K in the NVE ensemble with a time step of 1 fs by using the DFTB+ 1.0.1 package.62 The SK-parameters of mio-1-1 for C, N, O and H were employed.63 The density functional-based tight binding (DFTB) method, which is an approximation of DFT based on a second-order expansion of the DFT total energy around a reference electron density, proves to be a very powerful tool for carrying out quantum mechanical simulations for large systems, for example in the dye-sensitized solar cell field.63–65 The total electronic energy evolutions of the investigated dimers as a function of simulation time are documented in Fig. S2,† which indicates that the dimers of the investigated molecules reach thermal equilibrium within 30 ps. Secondly, the dimers with the lowest energies from the dynamics simulations were selected as the starting geometries and relaxed to their potential energy minimum at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level using the Gaussian 09 program package. We emphasize that the second calculation is time consuming due to the large dimensions of the systems, where the dimers of Spiro-OMeTAD, Spiro-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3 include 322, 402, 514 and 722 atoms, respectively.
In order to verify the reliability of above-mentioned method, we took Spiro-OMeTAD and tris[N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-biphenyl]amine (OMeTPA-TPA)66 as models to calculate their hole mobility, and the relevant data are listed in Table S4.† Spiro-OMeTAD and OMeTPA-TPA were selected as model molecules because they have similar non-planar triphenylamine structures and the same experimental testing method of hole mobility. As shown in Table S4,† the calculated hole mobilities of Spiro-OMeTAD and OMeTPA-TPA are 5.65 × 10−3 and 5.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while the corresponding experimental values are 4.53 × 10−4 and 1.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. It should be noticed that although we cannot obtain the accurate hole mobility, the relative ordering of hole mobility is consistent with that of the corresponding experimental values. So the method is reliable in qualitatively comparing molecular hole mobilities.
Based on the stable dimers of the investigated molecules, the centroid to centroid distances (ri, Å), hole transfer integrals v (eV), hole hopping rate k (s−1), and hole mobility (u, cm2 v−1 s−1) were obtained and are shown in Table 2.

As one can see from Table 2, Spiro-OMeTAD, Spiro-F1 and Spiro-F3 display similar hole transfer integrals due to the similar architectural structure including the same elements (C, H, N and O atoms), and Spiro-F2 has the smallest hole transfer integral of all the investigated molecules. According to the difference of hole transfer integrals between Spiro-OMeTAD, Spiro-F1, Spiro-F3 and Spiro-F2, we think that the methoxy group may play an important role in increasing the hole transfer integral due to its strong electron-donation ability. Importantly, the calculated hole mobilities of Spiro-OMeTAD, Spiro-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3 are 5.65 × 10−3, 1.75 × 10−2, 2.60 × 10−4 and 7.59 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Obviously, Spiro-F1 and Spiro-F3 have higher hole mobilities and Spiro-F2 has a smaller one compared with Spiro-OMeTAD. Thus PSCs based on Spiro-F1 and Spiro-F3 are expected to have high PCEs, and they may become potential HTM candidates.
Stability of isolated molecules
When one considers the use of HTMs for PSC applications it is important to know the stability of the material. In general, the stability of an organic semiconductor can be estimated by absolute hardness (η),31,67,68 which is the resistance of the chemical potential to change in the number of electrons.68,69 The larger the absolute hardness is, the better the stability of the material is. The absolute hardness of all investigated molecules is calculated using the operational definition given by:70η = (IP − EA)/2, where IP denotes the adiabatic ionization potential and EA represents the adiabatic electron affinity. The calculated absolute hardness values of Spiro-OMeTAD, Spiro-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3 are 1.62, 1.53, 1.53 and 1.42 eV, respectively, indicating that the stability of Spiro-F3 is the poorest in all investigated molecules, and Spiro-OMeTAD has the best stability, while Spiro-F1 and Spiro-F2 possess similar stability. It should be noted that the difference of absolute hardness among Spiro-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-OMeTAD is small, implying that the stability of Spiro-F1 and Spiro-F2 is comparable with that of Spiro-OMeTAD.
Additionally, the electrostatic surface potential (ESP) can also provide some important information about molecular stability.71 The ESPs of the investigated molecules are shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Electrostatic surface potentials mapped onto a surface of total electron density for all the investigated molecules. Regions of higher electron density are shown in red and those of lower electron density are shown in blue. 
The red colour and blue colour act as regions of negative charge and positive charge, respectively. The green colour represents the neutral region. For Spiro-OMeTAD and Spiro-F1, more partial positive charge is located on hydrogen atoms and benzene rings, while oxygen and nitrogen atoms are more negatively charged due to their strong electron withdrawing ability. For Spiro-F2, the negative charge is on the benzene rings, and the positive charge is distributed on the hydrogen atoms and the spiro-unit. Most of the negative charges are located on the methoxydiphenylamine units except the end-methyl groups, which are more negatively charged as well as the spiro-unit in Spiro-F3. From the aforementioned analysis, the stronger electron donating methoxydiphenylamine unit imparts negative charge on most of the carbon atoms which render the oxidation easy and decrease the stability. These results are in agreement with the absolute hardness. On the whole, for a single molecule, Spiro-OMeTAD, Spiro-F1 and Spiro-F2 show similar stability properties, while Spiro-F3 is the most easily oxidized of the four molecules.
Stability of the dimers
Considering the real situation, we further explored the dimeric stability of the studied molecules. The optimized dimeric structures of the investigated molecules are shown in Fig. 6. Hirshfeld surface analysis72 has been recently used as a valuable tool to analyze intermolecular interactions in crystals or dimers. This method has been adopted to characterize intermolecular interactions and elucidate similarities and differences in co-crystals, solvates and polymorphs. 2D fingerprint plots of the four molecules were obtained as shown in Fig. 7 using the Multiwfn program.73 Distinct features of the fingerprint plots were constructed with π⋯π, H⋯H, O⋯H and C–H⋯π interactions. As shown in Fig. 7, for Spiro-OMeTAD, Spiro-F1 and Spiro-F3, the π⋯π and O⋯H contacts make a more significant contribution to the total Hirshfeld surfaces, while for Sprio-F2, the intermolecular interactions mainly come from π⋯π and C–H⋯π. These results indicate that hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions are the main interactions in dimers.

Intermolecular interaction energy (ΔE), which is given by the expression ΔE = Edimer − 2Emonomer, is an important parameter to evaluate the stability of dimers. In the present work, ΔE was estimated using the dispersion corrected method B3LYP-D3. Dispersion corrections proposed by Grimme74 can improve the accuracy of theoretical simulations for systems including non-covalent interactions. The calculated ΔE values of Spiro-OMeTAD, Spiro-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3 are −1.46, −1.32, −1.95 and −5.67 eV, respectively, which indicates that the dimer of Spiro-F3 has the best stability in all investigated molecules.
As stated above, for isolated molecules, the new designed molecules have comparable stability with Spiro-OMeTAD except for Spiro-F3, and the dimers of Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3 possess better stability than that of Spiro-OMeTAD.
Conclusions
In summary, three spiro-type organic hole transport materials including Sprio-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3 are studied by using density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. Based on the calculated and experimental HOMO levels of 30 reference molecules, an empirical equation is proposed to accurately predict the HOMO levels of hole transport materials. The fitting HOMO levels of Spiro-F1, Spiro-F2 and Spiro-F3 are −5.31, −5.42 and −5.10 eV, respectively, based on the suggested experiential equation. PSCs with the designed HTMs may obtain higher open-circuit voltages compared with ones based on Spiro-OMeTAD.
Furthermore, a simplified method, in which the hole transport pathways are simplified to be one-dimensional, is presented and adopted to qualitatively compare molecular hole mobility. The results suggest that Spiro-1 and Spiro-3 exhibit higher hole mobility than Spiro-OMeTAD. In addition, Spiro-F3 has the smallest exciton binding energy in the investigated molecules. For the monomers, Spiro-OMeTAD, Spiro-F1 and Spiro-F2 show similar stability properties, and the dimers of Spiro-F2, and Spiro-F3 possess better stability than that of Spiro-OMeTAD. In view of a good hole transport performance, matched HOMO level, and acceptable stability, Spiro-F1 and Spiro-F3 will emerge as potential HTM candidates for efficient PSC applications. We hope that the results of this study can provide useful information for seeking super HTMs.
