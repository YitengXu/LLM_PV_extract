    , Accepted 21st September 2018First published on 21st September 2018AbstractOrganic semiconductors, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, are typically not responsive to near infrared (NIR) light due to their relatively large bandgaps. Here, we show that the NIR light at 980 nm can be efficiently converted to broadband visible upconversion (UC) emission by rubrene molecules in a solution dispersed with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). Spectroscopic characterizations indicate that the sensitization of emission by rubrene molecules strongly depends on the location of the 4f levels of Er3+ ions and the interplay between reabsorption and Förster-type energy transfer. Even for the solution with the highest rubrene concentration (>1 mg mL−1), energy transfer by reabsorption of UC emission from the UCNPs is the dominant process, and the radiationless resonant energy transfer process is weak, as the separation between most rubrene molecules and NCs is far larger than the Förster distance. The results of this work could be of particular interest for the development of organic–inorganic hybrid systems for NIR light harvesting and detection.
Introduction
The process of upconversion (UC) has attracted growing interest due to its diverse applications in photonics and related fields.1,2 Compared with frequency conversion based on a parametric process that relies on the use of expensive pulse lasers,3 the generation of visible UC emission facilitated by energy transfer in rare-earth (RE) doped materials is much more efficient under constant wave (CW) or even non-coherent light excitation.4,5 UC materials have been extensively exploited for diverse applications, such as solar light harvesting and bio-imaging.6–9 For instance, the harvesting of the near infrared (NIR) part of solar light has been made possible in photovoltaic (PV) devices with the help of UC materials doped with RE3+ ions. In photoelectrochemical cells, photocurrent generation under NIR light excitation was demonstrated in hetero-structures consisting of UC phosphors and inorganic semiconductors, including TiO2, Bi2S3 and Cu2O.10–12 The combination of UC phosphors with a Si-based solar cell as well as dye-sensitized solar cells has also allowed for the harvesting of NIR sub-bandgap photons,13–16 which otherwise do not contribute to light-to-electricity conversion. These early examples confirm that infrared light can be efficiently utilized in these hybrid PV devices as long as the energy of visible photons produced by the UC process is larger than that of the bandgap values of the semiconductors.
On the other hand, organic semiconductors have been extensively explored for applications including PV cells, flexible displays and wearable electronics. Compared with inorganic semiconductors, most of the organic semiconductors have relatively large bandgaps (mostly >1.5 eV), which are not optimal for PV cells. It is therefore highly desirable to extend the operational spectral range of organic PV cells to the NIR spectral range. Indeed, in a recent example, the integration of Yb3+–Ho3+ codoped UC phosphor into an organic PV cell was found to boost the NIR response as a result of the resorption of visible UC emission.17 More recently, by grafting the surface of UC nanoparticles with organic dye molecules, the quantum efficiency of the system was drastically improved benefiting from a Förster-type energy transfer.28 Nevertheless, direct radiative energy transfer by reabsorption can also be highly efficient in the solution phase, as exemplified recently by the upconversion of perovskite quantum dots dispersed in solutions containing UC nanoparticles.35 In fact, a large number of systems, including both inorganic and organic materials, can generate visible emissions that match the bandgaps of organic semiconductors such that the reabsorption of the UC emission or a direct resonant energy transfer could occur.18
In the present work, we examine the interactions in a solvent between a typical UC nanomaterial (NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+) and a typical organic semiconductor, rubrene (5,6,11,12-tetraphenyltetracene), which is characterized by strong photoluminescence and a large carrier mobility.19,20 Our results indicate that the visible emission of the organic molecules can be efficiently activated in the presence of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals (NCs) under NIR excitation. The mechanisms contributing to the sensitization are discussed with respect to both reabsorption and Förster-type energy transfer. The results of the present work may shed light on the use of organic semiconductor/UC hybrid devices for NIR light harvesting and NIR detectors.
Results and discussion
The hybrid upconversion system examined here is a solvent dispersion of NaYF4:20%Yb3+/1%Er3+ NCs and rubrene that serve as the sensitizer and transmitter, respectively. Yb3+, Er3+ codoped NaYF4 has been found to be an efficient UC material in which Yb3+ serves as the sensitizer that absorbs the NIR light,21 and rubrene exhibits a high singlet state fluorescence quantum yield (QY) (>98%) and short-lived (<20 ns) fluorescence lifetime.22 The energy transfer process and upconversion in Yb3+ and Er3+ codoped materials have been extensively examined.23–25 As depicted in Fig. 1, there is an obvious energy match in the first singlet excitation state of rubrene (S1) and the 4f levels of Er3+ in the spectral range from 400 nm to 600 nm, allowing efficient sensitization of the organic molecules in the solution. Specifically, the green emission (541 nm, from the transitions of 4S3/2 → 4I15/2) of Er3+ is in resonance with the S0 → S1 transition of rubrene molecules.

(c) Schematic of the energy level diagrams, energy transfer and visible emission schemes for the Yb3+/Er3+/rubrene system. It shows the process of the energy transfer between Yb3+/Er3+ and rubrene molecules. 
In the hybrid system, irradiation by a 980 nm laser initiates the Yb3+: 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transition that finally results in the emission of Er3+ and the rubrene molecules (580 nm) via the energy transfer process between the RE ions and rubrene molecules (Fig. 1c). The transfer of excitation energy from the NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ NCs to rubrene molecules in the solvent system occurs by either reabsorption of radiation or a Förster-type process depending on the distances between them. In concentrated solutions where the separation between molecule and NC is reduced, the radiationless ET (Förster-type process) could become dominant.26,27 Since the emission from rubrene is almost three orders of magnitude faster than that of the parity-forbidden f–f transition of RE ions, it is expected that the emission efficiency of the hybrid system can be enhanced.28
We first calculated the concentration dependence of the rubrene molecules surrounding the NCs within ranges of 5 nm, 10 nm and 20 nm (Fig. 1b). In this calculation, the NCs are approximated as spheres with a radius of 10 nm, and the rubrene molecules are dots with a radius of 0.5 nm. It is indicated that around 14.1% of rubrene molecules in a solution of 1.0 mg mL−1 are within the range of 10 nm, which is a typical distance that allows for Förster-type energy transfer. According to this calculation, we prepared a series of samples with varying rubrene concentrations, as listed in Table 1.

Newly monodispersive β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+/1%Er3+ NCs were obtained by a wet-chemistry process,29 as shown in Fig. 2a and b. The doping concentration of RE ions as well as the particle size was selected with care to ensure efficient generation of UC emission. From Fig. 2, hexagonal NCs with an average size of 20 nm can be observed. In addition, the NCs show high crystallinity, as evidenced by the clear electron diffraction pattern (inset in Fig. 2b).

The absorption spectra of NaYF4:20%Yb3+/1%Er3+, rubrene and NaYF4:20%Yb3+/1%Er3+@rubrene in cyclohexane are shown in Fig. 3a. Rubrene features a strong and broad absorption band covering a spectral range of 400–600 nm due to the transition to the first excitation state (S1). The absorption due to the f–f transitions of Yb3+ (2F7/2 → 2F5/2) can be observed at around 1000 nm, while the transitions of Er3+ are almost invisible in the measured spectral range. This is reasonable as the parity-forbidden f–f transitions of RE ions are intrinsically weak. Yb3+ has a relatively larger absorption cross section (around 10−20 cm2) and higher oscillator strengths than those of Er3+.30–32 Compared with RE ions, the absorption of rubrene molecules is much stronger, as shown in Fig. 3a. For the dispersion containing 8.14 × 10−6 mol L−1 NaYF4:20%Yb3+/1%Er3+ NCs, the estimated optical density for a sample of 1 cm thickness of Yb3+ and Er3+ at around 1000 nm, is on the order of 0.1 and 0.005, respectively.

(e) Dependence of the emission intensity ratio of 580 nm (rubrene) to 522 nm (Er3+) on the concentration of rubrene molecules. (f) Dependence of the emission intensity ratio of 580 nm (rubrene) to 541 nm (Er3+) on the concentration of rubrene molecules. 
The pictures of samples with varying concentrations of rubrene under 980 nm excitation show that the emission color can be finely tuned from bright bluish green to brownish yellow as a result of the variation in the spectral weight from emissions of Er3+ and rubrene (Fig. 3b). We then examined the emission spectrum of rubrene by excitation at 450 nm and the UC emission spectrum of NaYF4:20%Yb3+/1%Er3+ NCs by excitation at 980 nm (Fig. 3c). Obviously, we can observe that the emission of Er3+ at 522 nm and 541 nm is in resonance with the first singlet excitation state of rubrene (shown in the absorption spectrum), while the Er3+ emission at 655 nm overlaps with the emission spectrum of rubrene.

Fig. 3d shows the room-temperature upconversion emission spectra of the hybrid system in cyclohexane as solvent under excitation at 980 nm. A broadband emission peak at 580 nm is observed, which matches exactly the emission of rubrene under excitation at 450 nm (Fig. 3c). As shown in Fig. 3d, the emission at 541 nm is completely quenched, and this is accompanied by the steady rise of the broad emission from rubrene centered at 580 nm. In comparison, the reddish emission of Er3+ at 655 nm is almost unaffected. Fig. 3e and f show the dependence of the intensity ratio of 580 nm (rubrene) to 522 nm (Er3+), and 580 nm (rubrene) to 541 nm (Er3+) on the concentration of rubrene molecules, respectively. The results clearly indicate the presence of a strong interaction between rubrene and the NCs. In addition, we also measured the infrared emission spectrum of the samples under 980 nm excitation (Fig. S1, ESI†). Due to the transfer of the excitation energy from Yb3+ to Er3+ and then to rubrene molecules, the intensity of the Er3+ infrared emission (centred at 1550 nm by the transition of 4I13/2 → 4I15/2) also decreases with the rise of rubrene concentration. The quenching of NIR emission by Er3+ could be ascribed to the increased rates of cross-relaxation involving the singlet state of rubrene and 4f levels of Er3+. Meanwhile, we also measured the emission spectrum of the samples under 450 nm excitation (Fig. S3, ESI†). We only observed the emission of rubrene in the visible region, and the emission of RE ions was not observed in the visible-NIR region. This result suggests that back transfer of energy from rubrene to RE ions of Yb3+ and Er3+ does not occur possibly due to the small absorption cross section of f–f transitions of the RE ions.
To confirm the energy transfer process, the power dependence of UC emission was recorded for both the emission of Er3+ and rubrene. As shown in Fig. 4a, the UC emissions at 522 nm, 541 nm and 655 nm all involve a two-photon process, which is in agreement with the proposed energy transfer mechanism depicted in Fig. 1c. In addition, the broadband emission of rubrene also follows exactly a two-photon process (Fig. 4b) in spite of the difference in rubrene concentration. That is, absorption of two photons at 980 nm by Yb3+ finally results in the emission of one visible photon by rubrene. Combined with the fact that direct excitation of rubrene at 980 nm does not produce UC emission, the UC from rubrene can be only ascribed to the energy transfer from Er3+ ions. At high excitation densities, a saturation effect probably occurs, which can be seen from the deviation from the linear relation, especially for samples with small rubrene concentrations.

Gray, light blue and magenta lines show the fitting results of power density dependence of the upconverted Yb3+/Er3+ emission at 541 nm, 522 nm and 655 nm, respectively. (b) log–log plot of upconversion signal (rubrene emission at 580 nm) versus excitation density (mW cm−2) for NaYF4:20%Yb3+/1%Er3+/rubrene dispersed in cyclohexane (samples 2–7) under 980 nm excitation. Red, orange, dark yellow, green, blue and magenta lines show the fitting results for samples with varying concentrations of rubrene molecules. 
To quantify the energy transfer process between the organic molecules and inorganic NCs, we then measured the emission lifetimes at 522 nm (Er3+), 541 nm (Er3+) and 655 nm (Er3+) under excitation at 980 nm. Fig. 6a–g and Fig. S5, S6 (ESI†) present the fluorescence decay curves of the hybrid system (NaYF4:20%Yb3+/1%Er3+@rubrene) with varying concentrations of rubrene (0.25–2.0 mg mL−1). The lifetime values (details are given in ESI†) are plotted against rubrene concentration in Fig. 6h. The decrease in the lifetime with the rise of rubrene concentration indicates the presence of resonant energy transfer from Er3+ to rubrene molecules, considering the energy match between Er3+: 4S3/2 and S1 of rubrene.
Before calculating the energy transfer efficiency, we checked the self-quenching of rubrene, considering that the examined concentrations are high. To do this, we recorded the emission spectra and fluorescence decay curves of rubrene solutions over a wide concentration range (0.05–3.0 mg mL−1) (Fig. 5 and Fig. S2 in ESI†). As shown in Fig. 5, the spectra show two peaks located at 565 nm and 590 nm, respectively, and the intensity ratio of the 565 nm peak to the 590 nm peak decreases gradually with the increase of rubrene concentration. However, the lifetime values at both wavelengths remain almost unchanged (Fig. S2, ESI†), suggesting that collisional inter-molecule interactions can be excluded. The evolution of emission spectra with the rise of rubrene concentration therefore can be related to the self-absorption of rubrene (refer to absorption spectrum of rubrene in Fig. 3c), which may limit the total emission efficiency of the hybrid system. Nevertheless, the presence of self-quenching in rubrene molecules does not affect the calculation of energy transfer efficiency discussed below.
 Fig. 5  Emission spectra of rubrene solutions with different concentrations. 
The total excitation energy transferred to rubrene can be estimated by the change in the integrated emission intensity according to: (1)where ηT is the total energy transfer efficiency between NaYF4:20%Yb3+/1%Er3+ and rubrene, and Ii and I1 are the intensities of the Er3+ emission in the presence and absence of rubrene, respectively. The result in Fig. 6i shows that complete energy transfer to rubrene is achieved at the rubrene concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1. Particularly, the total emission intensity increases by 24% for sample 3 (rubrene concentration is 0.5 mg mL−1). For other samples, we observed a slight decrease in total emission intensity. This energy transfer contains the contribution from both reabsorption and Förster-type resonance ET. The latter can be determined by the change in the emission lifetime according to:33 (2)where ηF is the resonance energy transfer efficiency (by Förster process), and τi and τ1 are the lifetime values of the specific UC emission of Er3+ in the presence and absence of rubrene, respectively. Then, the contribution of pure reabsorption can be calculated by: ηR = ηT − ηF(3)where ηR is the energy transfer efficiency due to reabsorption. By introducing the Förster distance (R0), the energy transfer efficiency can be written as:34 (4)where r is the average distance between the NC and rubrene molecule.

(i) Total energy transfer efficiency between Yb3+/Er3+ and rubrene vs. rubrene concentration. (j) Resonance energy transfer (by Förster process) vs. rubrene concentration. (k) Energy transfer efficiency due to reabsorption vs. rubrene concentration. 
In Fig. 6j, it can be found that the growth trend of resonance energy transfer efficiency (ηF) shows two stages with the increase of rubrene concentration. The initial rise of ηF with concentration of rubrene (from 0.0 to 0.5 mg mL−1) is large, while the rise of ηF afterward is small. We think that the initial rise of ηF with concentration might be ascribed to the surface physical adsorption of a small amount of rubrene molecules by the nanoparticles (similar to the case of ref. 28), which leads to a high rate of FRET. This physical adsorption is rapidly saturated; therefore, the further rise of the concentration of rubrene does not lead to the increase of ηF, because most of the rubrene molecules are freely distributed in the solution, rather than residing on the surface of the nanoparticles.
At the highest rubrene concentration (2.0 mg mL−1), according to eqn (2), the contribution of energy transfer from 4S3/2 to S1 due to the Förster-type process is 4.08% for the 541 nm emission, while the rest is contributed from reabsorption (Fig. 6j). From Fig. 6k, it is clear that reabsorption is dominating for all the concentrations examined. According to eqn (4), we find a Förster distance of 10.5 nm, which suggests that 16.0% of the rubrene molecules are within the range of efficient Förster energy transfer. The calculated R0 values of the Förster-type process (by 4S3/2 → S1) are in the range of 8–11 nm. For the 522 nm emission, we only recorded the decay curves of the sample with a rubrene concentration of 0.25 mg mL−1 (Fig. S6, ESI†) as this emission is completely quenched for samples with higher rubrene concentrations. The result shows that the decay rate remains almost unchanged (Fig. S6, ESI†), suggesting that no resonance energy occurs between 2H11/2 of Er3+ and the S1 state of rubrene in sample 2 with a low rubrene concentration (0.25 mg mL−1). Therefore, the quenching of the 522 nm emission by rubrene can be reasonably attributed to the reabsorption process. In the off-resonance range, for the 655 nm emission, we found that the lifetime value is almost unchanged (Fig. S5, ESI†), indicating that the 4F9/2 level of Er3+ does not participate in the ET process.
The above results imply that the efficiency of energy transfer by the Förster type process strongly depends on the energy match between the 4f levels of Er3+ and the S1 state of rubrene and the separation between NCs and organic molecules. This can be rationalized by considering that Förster-type energy transfer is a short-range process and only a small number of the rubrene molecules are located within the Förster distance (10.1 nm). Beyond this range, energy transfer between NC and rubrene still occurs, but it is dominated by the radiative reabsorption process.
Conclusion
In summary, our experimental results demonstrate that the upconversion of NIR light to broad visible light can occur in a solution containing NaYF4:20%Yb3+/1%Er3+ NCs and rubrene molecules. The process of generating broad visible light emission can be interpreted in terms of both radiative reabsorption and a non-radiative Förster type process. The latter only becomes important for molecules that are located close to the RE-doped NCs within distances shorter than the Förster distance. Whereas further reduction of the donor–acceptor distance is limited by the solubility of the molecule and nanoparticle, it would be of particular interest to examine solid state systems where much shorter molecule–nanoparticle separation is expected.

Synthesis of NaYF4:20%Yb3+/1%Er3+ nanocrystals
In a typical process, 16 mL of an aqueous solution of Re(OOCCH3)3 (0.2 mmol L−1, Re = Y, Yb, or Er) was added to a 250 mL three-neck flask containing 24 mL of OA and 56 mL of ODE. The mixture was heated to 150 °C for 40 min under vigorous magnetic stirring and then cooled down to 50 °C naturally. Afterward, a mixture of NaOH (8 mmol) and NH4F (12.8 mmol) dissolved in methanol was added and stirred for 1 h. The resultant solution was heated to 100 °C and kept for 30 min to remove methanol by evaporation. After purging with argon, the solution was heated to 290 °C and kept for 2 h. After cooling down to ambient temperature, the obtained NCs were precipitated by addition of ethanol, and then they were collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol several times, and finally re-dispersed in cyclohexane (4.07 × 10−6 mol L−1).
Preparation of solution containing rubrene and NCs
2 mL of the above cyclohexane solution of NaYF4:20%Yb3+/1%Er3+ was dried in a vacuum and then re-dispersed in a toluene solution of rubrene. By addition of cyclohexane and constant ultrasonic agitation, a homogeneous solution was obtained. The concentrations of rubrene and NCs of the examined solutions are shown in Table 1.
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out on a FEG-TEM (Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin, Philips-FEI, Netherlands) system operating at an acceleration voltage of 160 kV. Absorption spectra of the samples were recorded with a U-4100 spectrophotometer (HITACHI). Upconversion emission spectra as well as the decay curves were recorded at ambient temperature using an FLS-920 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments). A continuous-wave 980 nm diode laser was employed as the excitation source for steady state spectral measurement, and a pulse 980 nm (mechanically chopped) laser was employed for recording the decay curves. The fluorescence decay curves were measured using the same spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments) under excitation of a 980 nm pulsed laser (PhotoniTech Pte Ltd) with a pulse frequency of 20 Hz. All the spectra shown here have been calibrated for detector sensitivity.
