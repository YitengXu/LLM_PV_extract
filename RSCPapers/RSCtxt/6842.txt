    , Accepted 2nd March 2015First published on 10th March 2015AbstractThe effectiveness of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) in water reduction on a CuGaS2 photocathode was demonstrated. Graphene oxide was photocatalytically reduced over CuGaS2 particles under visible light irradiation to give an RGO–CuGaS2 composite. The incorporated RGO dramatically enhanced the cathodic photocurrent of the CuGaS2 photoelectrode under visible light irradiation. Detection of evolved H2 indicated that the enhanced cathodic photocurrent was used for water reduction to H2. Upon combining the developed RGO–CuGaS2 composite photocathode with a BiVO4 photoanode loaded with a CoOx cocatalyst, photocurrent and the corresponding H2 evolution were successfully observed without applying an external bias between both photoelectrodes under simulated sunlight irradiation.
Introduction
Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting have been extensively studied as artificial photosynthesis.1–4 An advantage of the photoelectrochemical water splitting is the separate H2 evolution from O2. Moreover, the band bending formed by an applied potential assists charge separation to give high performance in a photoelectrochemical reaction. In other words, a photocatalyst which thermodynamically possesses insufficient potential for water splitting can be used for photoelectrochemical water splitting.
Metal sulfides with narrow band gaps are a promising material group for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation.2,5 However, a powdered metal sulfide photocatalyst requires sacrificial reagents to function steadily, because photogenerated holes in the sulfide particle oxidize the sulfide photocatalyst itself, resulting in photocorrosion. In other words, metal sulfide particulate photocatalysts are not suitable for water splitting into H2 and O2. This disadvantage can be overcome by employing metal sulfides in a photoelectrode system. Note that metal sulfides have to be p-type semiconductors if they are to be employed as photocathodes on which reduction reactions proceed. In this system, the photogenerated holes in metal sulfides are removed from the electrode, resulting in suppression of photocorrosion and achievement of photoelectrochemical water splitting.6,7 Therefore, the performance improvement of metal sulfide photoelectrodes is a significant and attractive issue.
In a photoelectrode prepared by depositing photocatalyst particles on a conductive substrate electrode, particle–particle and particle–substrate interfaces would be some of the recombination sites of photogenerated carriers.8 We have reported that the incorporation of conductive reduced graphene oxide (RGO) improves the electrochemical performance of BiVO4 with an n-type semiconductor character.9 In this system, the RGO forms new and effective ways for the electron migration and boosts the electron migration from the photocatalyst particles to the conductive substrate electrode. A similar enhancement was observed for the n-type TiO2 and WO3 photoelectrodes.10–12 These enhancements in the n-type semiconductor photoelectrode motivate us to investigate the effectiveness of RGO in the electrochemical performance of a p-type semiconductor photoelectrode. In order to achieve efficient water splitting using a photoelectrochemical cell consisting of a photocathode and a photoanode, the development of a highly efficient photocathode is also significant.
In the present study, we focus on the established metal sulfide of CuGaS2 with a p-type semiconductor character.13–15 The RGO–CuGaS2 composite was prepared by reducing GO over CuGaS2 under visible light irradiation, and the effectiveness of RGO in water splitting on a CuGaS2 photoelectrode was investigated. Solar hydrogen production using a photoelectrochemical cell consisting of the developed RGO–CuGaS2 composite photocathode and a CoOx-loaded BiVO4 photoanode was also demonstrated.
Experimental
Synthesis of graphene oxide and CuGaS2 powder
Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized from a commercially obtained graphite powder using Hummers' method.16 Graphite was oxidized to graphene oxide using KMnO4 in a sulfuric acid solution containing NaNO3. The obtained GO was collected as a dark brown powder by filtration.
CuGaS2 was synthesized by a solid–state reaction. Starting materials of Cu2S (Kojundo Chemical Lab, 99%) and Ga2S3 (Kojundo Chemical Lab, 99.99%) in a molar ratio of Cu:Ga = 1:1.2 were mixed in an agate mortar. The mixed powder was encapsulated in a quartz tube after evacuation, and was subsequently calcined at 1073 K for 10 h.
Preparation of the RGO–CuGaS2 composite
The RGO–CuGaS2 composite was prepared by photocatalytic reduction of GO over CuGaS2 under visible light irradiation. A certain amount of GO powder (5 wt% to CuGaS2) and 0.3–0.5 g of CuGaS2 powder were dispersed in a 50 vol% of aqueous methanol solution (30 mL). The suspensions were stirred and bubbled with Ar gas during visible light irradiation for 3 hours.
Characterization
The crystal phase of the obtained CuGaS2 was assigned to the chalcopyrite phase (Fig. S1†) by X-ray diffraction (Rigaku, MiniFlex). Diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained using a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (JASCO, V-570) equipped with an integrating sphere and were converted to absorbance by the Kubelka–Munk method. The reduction state of GO was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Kratos Analytical, ESCA-3400). The morphology of the photocatalyst powder, composite, and photoelectrode was observed using a scanning electron microscope (JEOL, JSM-6700F). Electrochemical impedance spectra were obtained by AC impedance measurement using a frequency response analyzer (Solartron Analytical, Model 1260A). The measurement was carried out in 0.1 mol L−1 of a K2SO4 solution at 0.1 V of AC voltage over the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz.
Preparation of photoelectrodes
CuGaS2 and RGO–CuGaS2 composite photoelectrodes were prepared by a drop-casting method. CuGaS2 and RGO–CuGaS2 composite powders were dispersed in ethanol (1 mg mL−1) by sonication. The suspension was drop-cast onto an FTO substrate (Asahi Glass) to obtain 1–2 mg cm−2 of CuGaS2 on the FTO. The powder-loaded FTO was calcined at 773 K for 2 hours in a N2 atmosphere. The thickness of the deposited photocatalyst particles was determined using a 3D Laser Scanning Microscope (Keyence, VK-X200).
A BiVO4 photoanode was prepared from an aqueous precursor solution according to a previous report.17 A precursor-pasted FTO substrate was calcined at 673 K for 2 hours in air to obtain crystallized BiVO4 on the FTO substrate. The CoOx cocatalyst was loaded on the BiVO4 photoelectrode by dropwise addition of a certain amount of an aqueous Co(NO3) solution and subsequent calcination at 673 K for 2 hours in air.
Photoelectrochemical measurement
Photoelectrochemical properties were evaluated with a three-electrode system consisting of working, Ag/AgCl reference, and Pt counter electrodes using a potentiostat (Hokuto Denko; HZ-5000 and HZ-7000). 0.1 mol L−1 of an aqueous K2SO4 solution was used as an electrolyte. A 300 W Xe lamp (Asahi Spectra, MAX-301) with a long-pass filter (Kenko, L42) was employed as a light source. H2 and O2 evolved were determined using gas chromatography (Shimadzu; MS-5A column, TCD, Ar carrier). The metal cations in the electrolyte after the photoelectrochemical measurement were analyzed by ICP-AES (Hitachi High-Tech Science, SPS3500) to determine the durability of the photoelectrode. The detection limits of Cu and Ga are 1 ppb and 10 ppb, respectively.
A 300 W Xe lamp with band-pass filters was employed for measurement of incident photon to photocurrent efficiency (IPCE). The number of incident photons was measured using a photodiode head (OPHIRA; PD300-UV) and a power monitor (NOVA). IPCE was calculated as follows.[IPCE%] = 1240 × [photocurrent density/μA cm−2]/([wavelength/nm] × [photon flux/W m−2])
Photoelectrochemical water splitting was carried out using a two-electrode cell consisting of a RGO–CuGaS2 composite photocathode and a Co-loaded BiVO4 photoanode. A solar simulator (Asahi Spectra; HAL-320) was used as a light source. The solar energy conversion efficiency was calculated as follows.[Solar energy conversion efficiency%] = 100 × [photocurrent density/mA cm−2] × (1.23 − Eapply/V)/[solar energy (AM1.5)/mW cm−2]
Results and discussion
Characterization of the RGO–CuGaS2 composite
The suspension of graphene oxide (GO) and CuGaS2 powder was yellow as shown in Fig. 1A. The color turned darker upon irradiation under visible light, implying that GO was reduced photocatalytically to reduced graphene oxide (RGO) by CuGaS2, judging from the darker color of RGO (black) than that of GO (brown).9,18,19 The oxidation state of GO was analyzed by XPS as shown in Fig. 1B. The GO has typical three peaks due to carbon species with different surroundings of C–C, C–O, and CO as previously reported.20,21 The intensity of the peak of C–O dramatically decreased upon visible light irradiation, indicating that the GO was reduced to RGO. A similar decrease was observed, when TiO2 and BiVO4 photocatalysts were used.9,10Fig. 1C shows the SEM image of the collected powder after visible light irradiation. The RGO sheets and CuGaS2 particles were attached to each other. These characterization tests revealed that the RGO–CuGaS2 composite was successfully obtained. Additionally, no change in the absorption edge of CuGaS2 between with and without RGO was observed (Fig. S2†), indicating that the RGO did not affect the energy structure of CuGaS2.

Photoelectrochemical performance of the RGO–CuGaS2 composite under visible light irradiation
The obtained composite was pasted on a FTO conductive substrate by a drop-casting method and subsequent calcination in a N2 atmosphere. Fig. 2 shows the photoelectrochemical performance of the RGO–CuGaS2 composite. The pristine CuGaS2 electrode showed cathodic photocurrent under visible light irradiation. The cathodic photocurrent was dramatically improved by incorporating RGO. As a reference, the photoelectrochemical performance of a physical mixture of commercial conductive carbon black and CuGaS2 was also evaluated. However, no enhanced photocurrent was observed. This indicates the advantage of RGO with a characteristic large two-dimensional sheet to obtain good contact with many CuGaS2 particles.

In order to exclude the possibility that the increased cathodic photocurrent is due to the further reduction of RGO, the evolved gas was analyzed using GC. H2 evolved under visible light irradiation corresponding to the cathodic photocurrent as shown in Fig. 3. This almost 100% Faradaic efficiency indicates that the cathodic photocurrent is due to the water reduction to produce H2. Moreover, we have analyzed the metal cation species in the electrolyte by ICP after 6 h of photoelectrochemical measurement under similar conditions of Fig. 3 to clarify the stability of the RGO–CuGaS2 photoelectrode. No detection of Cu and Ga ions indicated that those ions did not leach from CuGaS2 particles.

The onsets of IPCEs of the RGO–CuGaS2 composite electrode measured at both 0 V and 0.4 V vs. RHE (pH 7) agreed well with the absorption edge of CuGaS2 as shown in Fig. 4. This agreement indicates that the cathodic photocurrent was generated accompanied by the band gap photoexcitation of CuGaS2. This result indicates that the RGO-sensitized reaction proposed in an RGO–TiO2 system20,22 did not proceed at least in our composite electrode system.

Fig. 5 shows the effect of the amount of the RGO on the photocurrent of the composite photoelectrode irradiated with visible light from an FTO transparent substrate side and a particle side of the photoelectrode. The percentages on the bars represent the rate of the photocurrent obtained with irradiation from a particle side to that from an FTO substrate side. Again, all of the RGO–CuGaS2 composite photoelectrodes showed higher cathodic photocurrent than the pristine CuGaS2 photoelectrode. The photocurrent was improved with an increase in the amount of RGO. Additionally, the rate of the photocurrent obtained with irradiation from a particle side to that from an FTO substrate side also increased with the increase in the amount of RGO. This clearly indicates the role of RGO in the RGO–CuGaS2 composite photoelectrode as discussed in detail below. Laser scanning microscope observation revealed that the thickness of the RGO–CuGaS2 composite photoelectrode was about 2–3 μm. Additionally, the absorption coefficient of CuGaS2 in the visible range is 20000–50000 cm−1.23 The thickness of the photoelectrode and the absorption coefficient suggest that the particles far from the FTO substrate were mainly excited, when the photoelectrode was irradiated with visible light from a particle side. Therefore, in the CuGaS2 photoelectrode without RGO, most of the photogenerated holes could not reach the FTO substrate because of a long way to the FTO substrate with high resistance. In contrast, in the RGO–CuGaS2 composite photoelectrode, photogenerated holes in the particles far from the FTO substrate were efficiently consumed by electrons delivered from the FTO substrate to particles through the RGO as shown in Fig. 6. Therefore, the rate of the photocurrent obtained with irradiation from a particle side to that from a FTO substrate side also increased as the amount of RGO increased. The remaining photoexcited electrons reduced water to H2 on the particle surface. The reduction of internal resistance of a CuGaS2 photoelectrode by incorporation of RGO was supported by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Fig. S3†), as observed in the RGO–TiO2 photoelectrode.24 Thus, the RGO enhanced the electrochemical performance for the reduction of water to H2 over the CuGaS2 photoelectrode. In RGO–photoanode systems such as RGO–TiO2, RGO–BiVO4, and RGO–WO3, the RGO promotes the electron migration from photocatalyst particles to a conductive substrate.9–12 The present study reveals that the incorporation of RGO is also an effective strategy to enhance the photocathodic process.

Photoelectrochemical cell combining a RGO–CuGaS2 composite photocathode with a CoOx-loaded BiVO4 photoanode
The RGO–CuGaS2 composite photocathode possessed electrochemically sufficient onset potential to fabricate a photoelectrochemical cell using a CoOx-loaded BiVO4 photoanode for water splitting without an external bias (Fig. S4†). Fig. 7 shows the I–V curve of the photoelectrochemical cell using the RGO–CuGaS2 composite of a photocathode and CoOx-loaded BiVO4 of a photoanode under simulated sunlight irradiation. The photoelectrochemical cell generated photocurrent. The photocurrent increased with applying larger bias between the photocathode and the photoanode. Most interestingly, the photocurrent was obvious even without any external bias. Gas phase analysis revealed that the certain H2 evolved corresponds to the observed photocurrent (Fig. S5†). Unfortunately, O2 was not detected probably due to the low photocurrent and the low sensitivity of our GC with an Ar carrier which has similar thermal conductivity to O2. However, the BiVO4 photoelectrode is widely known as a promising photoanode for water oxidation to form O2.17,25–27 Therefore, the experimental situation and conditions suggest that solar water splitting using the photoelectrochemical cell without any external bias was achieved.

Conclusions
A RGO–CuGaS2 composite was successfully obtained by photocatalytically reducing graphene oxide to reduced graphene oxide (RGO) over CuGaS2 particles under visible light irradiation. The RGO–CuGaS2 composite photoelectrode showed higher cathodic photocurrent under visible light irradiation than a pristine CuGaS2 photoelectrode. The rate of H2 evolution agreed well with the theoretical rate calculated from the observed cathodic photocurrent, indicating that RGO was not further reduced during the photoelectrochemical reaction and the photocurrent was used for water reduction. The wavelength dependency revealed that the photocurrent was generated accompanied by band gap photoexcitation of CuGaS2. The photoelectrochemical cell consisting of the enhanced RGO–CuGaS2 composite photocathode and a CoOx-loaded BiVO4 photoanode generated photocurrent under simulated sunlight irradiation without any external applied bias. Thus, the present study demonstrated the potential of the reduced graphene oxide for enhancing the photoelectrochemical performance of a powder-based metal sulfide photocathode for solar water splitting. This present study provides a new way of utilizing metal sulfide materials for photoelectrochemical solar water splitting by incorporating reduced graphene oxide.
