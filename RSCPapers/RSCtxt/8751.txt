    , Accepted 24th May 2018First published on 31st May 2018AbstractThe perovskite layer is a crucial component influencing high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In the one-step solution method, anti-solvents are important for obtaining smooth and uniform perovskite active layers. This work explored the effect of various anti-solvents on the preparation of triple cation perovskite active layers. In general, anti-solvents with low dielectric constants, low polarity, and low boiling point are suitable for the preparation of perovskite films. Microstructural and elemental analyses of the perovskite films were systematically conducted by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The photoelectric properties, carrier transfer, and recombination process in the PSCs were investigated using photocurrent–voltage characteristic curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Optimum performance was obtained when the anti-solvent was diethyl ether (DEE) and the ratio of the optimum amount of DEE to the volume of the precursor was 1:10. Meanwhile, we found that the partial replacement of formamidinium/methylammonium by cesium could increase the stability of the PSCs and enhance the power conversion efficiency from 15.49% to over 17.38%.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained increasing attention owing to their excellent photovoltaic properties, such as strong optical absorption, long charge carrier diffusion lengths, high carrier mobility, and tunable composition of the cation and halide.1–5 Indeed, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased from 3.9% to 22.7% over the past few years.6–8 However, perovskite stability remains a problem, and research efforts are still needed to overcome this limitation. Thus, several studies have attempted to understand perovskite degradation, and the results show that this process is promoted by moisture, UV irradiation, and high temperatures.9–13 Previous studies have prevented perovskite degradation using various strategies, including the use of carbon-based compounds,14 inorganic materials,15–17 and hydrophobic dopants.18 However, the addition of an extra layer affects the energy levels or the interface between the hole transport materials (HTMs) and perovskite, and increases transport resistance, which reduces the efficiency of the resulting solar cell devices. Tuning the composition of lead halide perovskites by introducing mixed cations and halides stabilizes the solution process to produce a perovskite with uniform large grains, which increases the efficiency and durability of solar cells. Mixed perovskites are durable against exposure to heat and moisture, whereas single cation perovskites such as methyl ammonium halide, formamidinium lead halide, and cesium lead halide (X = I, Cl, or Br) exhibit relatively low stability in ambient circumstances.19–22 Mixed cation [formamidinium (FA), methylammonium (MA), and cesium (Cs)]-based perovskites are promising materials to obtain solar cells with compatible high efficiency and durability. Seok et al.20 have investigated the compositional engineering of (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x compounds in PSCs. Meanwhile, Graetzel et al.23,24 have shown that PSCs with FA/MA mixed cations have a high efficiency exceeding 20%. Park et al.25 have studied whether Cs addition to FA on planar heterojunction PSCs improves stability compared with pure FAPbI3 under moisture and light illumination. Saliba et al.26 have discovered that the addition of Cs into FA/MA can improve the crystal growth and morphology of the perovskite, which facilitates efficient charge collection and thereby stabilizes the high efficiency of PSCs. The introduction of Cs to an FA/MA-perovskite also further suppresses yellow phase impurities. Cs/MA/FA triple cation mixture PSCs exhibit a PCE of 21.2%. Therefore, the FA/MA/Cs triple cation perovskite is a competitive candidate as a light absorber material for photovoltaic applications.
Besides, heterogeneous nucleation occurs in a one-step solution process due to the early crystallization of the perovskite material, generating differently sized perovskite crystals on the substrate. Thus, depressing the crystal grain growth rate of perovskites is an important task. An effective method is used to replace dimethylformamide (DMF) with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which leads to a PCE of 13.5% to retard the crystal grain growth rate.27 However, PSCs exhibit considerable hysteresis because of the residue of DMSO and PbI2. Hence, Seok et al. proposed a novel method in which unannealed perovskite films are washed with an anti-solvent to remove solvent residues during spinning where MAI and PbI2 are dissolved in a mixture of c-butyrolactone and DMSO.28 Park et al. explored the underlying mechanism and found that PbI2 in the perovskite precursor solution acts as a Lewis acid and forms an intermediate phase of CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMSO with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry upon reaction with DMSO.25 This classical precipitation method is conducive for the growth of single perovskite crystals. This method has been employed to prepare polycrystalline perovskite films with pure and stable crystal phases accompanied by excellent surface coverage, leading to highly reproducible efficiencies close to 22%. Previous studies have proposed some efficient anti-solvents that aid the preparation of homogenous large-grained perovskite films.27–32 The results showed that a large number of chemicals can be used as anti-solvents. However, the selection and other conditions of anti-solvents for preparing triple cation perovskite films are unclear. Therefore, the selection of an anti-solvent and its dropping volume has become a significant issue when fabricating high-performance perovskite photovoltaic devices. Most previous studies have not determined the impact of anti-solvent species and their amount used during the preparation of perovskite layers.
Based on these considerations, in this work, we have developed a systematic study for determining the suitability of several anti-solvents, including toluene (TL), chlorobenzene (CB), ethyl acetate (EA), diethyl ether (DEE), and isopropyl alcohol (IPA), on the triple cation perovskite active layer. The most suitable anti-solvent for the preparation of PSCs is DEE because it drives the perovskite precursor into the metastable zone instead of the supersaturation zone. Furthermore, the dropping volume ratio of the perovskite precursor to the anti-solvent (DEE) is 1:10 (v:v), which is the optimal condition for the preparation of PSCs (the substrate area is 2.25 cm2). The DEE dropping volume considerably influences film morphology and crystallization, and the optimal dropping volume can generate the largest perovskite grain size (∼500 nm) and flat surface. It benefits the subsequent layers, such as spiro-OMeTAD or Au metal contact. An excess or less DEE dropping volume produces a large amount of tiny perovskite crystals or discontinuous perovskite layers at post-annealing. Under the optimal conditions, this perovskite photovoltaic device shows a power conversion efficiency as high as 17.4%.
Experimental section
Materials
The chemicals used to prepare the perovskite (FAI, CsI, PbBr2, PbI2, and MAI) and the HTL [Spiro-MeOTAD, 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP), and lithium-bis(tri-fluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI)] solution were purchased from Shanghai MaterWin New Materials Co., Ltd. DMSO (≥99.9%) and 4-hydroxybutyric acid lactone (DMF) (≥99.9%) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and Aladdin, respectively.
Device fabrication
The Cs5(FA0.83MA0.17)95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 precursor solution was prepared in a glove box. FAI (1.2 M), PbI2 (1.32 M), MABr (0.24 M), and PbBr2 (0.24 M) were dissolved in anhydrous DMF:DMSO = 4:1 vol%. Then, CsI predissolved as a 1.5 M stock solution in DMSO was added to the mixed perovskite precursor to achieve the desired triple cation composition. F-Doped SnO2 substrate (FTO, a sheet resistance of 14 Ω cm2) was sequentially cleaned with a detergent, acetone, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol and then subjected to ultraviolet-ozone treatment for 30 min. A compact hole-blocking TiO2 layer (bl-TiO2) was formed by magnetron sputtering at 100 W for 40 min (SKY Technology Development Co., Ltd). The film was annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. The perovskite solution was spin coated on top of the TiO2 layer; during the first spin-coating step, the mixed perovskite films were deposited from a 30 μl precursor solution at 1000 rpm for 6 s, and during the second spin-coating step, the perovskite layer was treated with different anti-solvents (DEE, CB, TL, EA, and IPA) in a 100 μL volume and DEE in different volumes of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 μL at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Films with the Cs-containing perovskite turned dark immediately after spin-coating. These films were then annealed at 100 °C for 60 min in a nitrogen-filled glove box. As an HTM, a Spiro-OMeTAD solution (72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL of tBP, and 17.5 μL of a Li-TFSI solution (520 mg Li-TFSI/1 mL acetonitrile) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s on the perovskite. The substrates with the HTM were left overnight in dry air in the dark at room temperature. Finally, a 50 nm-thick Au electrode was thermally evaporated on top of the HTM to produce a completed PSC device.
Device characterization
Absorbance was recorded using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the annealed perovskite films were collected with a Bruker-AXS D8 Advance. The elemental states of the sample were analyzed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi). The incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the PSCs was measured with a 300 W xenon lamp (Newport 66984). The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were evaluated under simulated AM 1.5G radiation (100 mW cm−2 irradiance) by using a solar simulator (Oriel, model 91192-1000) and a source meter (Keithley 2400, USA). The top views of the perovskite films were imaged using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Jeol JEM 6510LV). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on an electrochemical workstation (Zennium, IM6, Germany) over the frequency range of 100 mHz–2 MHz with 10 mV AC amplitude at −0.9 V bias under simulated AM 1.5G radiation (100 mW cm−2 irradiance). The devices were measured under ambient conditions [15% < relative humidity (RH) < 60%] every time (winter, summer). After the measurements, the devices were stored in a humidity-controlled dry room (15% < RH > 40%).
Results and discussion
The device configuration of our PSCs is presented in Fig. 1. Except for the compact TiO2 coated through magnetron sputtering, the other layers were coated by spin coating. The Cs5(FA0.83MA0.17)95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite absorber layer was sandwiched between a block TiO2 (bl-TiO2) layer and a Spiro-OMeTAD layer, where the electrons and holes were transported to c-TiO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. Fig. S1† shows the schematic of the partial replacement of FA+ (or MA+) with Cs+. Cs5(FA0.83MA0.17)95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3, which has a tetragonal perovskite structure, is a relatively underexplored alternative for light absorption that provides a framework for binding organic and inorganic components into a molecular composite.33

Fig. 2 shows the photographs taken after the anti-solvent treatment process. Different anti-solvents (CB, DEE, EA, IPA, and TL) were added dropwise on the surface of the perovskite layer. When the amount of anti-solvent was 500 μL, some cracks appeared on the surface of all perovskite layers. When this amount was 100 μL, several cracks remained on the surface after IPA treatment. These cracks decrease the photoelectric performance of the device. Therefore, IPA is unsuitable as an anti-solvent for the preparation of the perovskite layer than the other anti-solvents because of its greater solubility in the perovskite precursor DEE. We believe that the anti-solvent solution plays a critical role during the perovskite layer formation. These anti-solvent solutions can strongly affect the surface morphology and coverage as well as the crystallization kinetics. Thus, the selection of an anti-solvent is important when preparing PSCs. As previously reported, the anti-solvent can significantly reduce the solubility of the solute in solution but does not completely inhibit it; it also accelerates homogenous nucleation due to supersaturation.33–35 In the present study, only five anti-solvents (DEE, CB, TL, EA, and IPA) were considered as suitable washing solvents for the perovskite layer fabrication. Studies on the formation of the perovskite films were performed in detail.
 Fig. 2  Photographs of perovskite films were taken after the anti-solvent treatment. 
For comparison, the SEM images of the perovskite layers treated with anti-solvents are shown in Fig. 3. The anti-solvent volumes were set to 100 and 500 μL. Comparison of the first and third rows showed that the surface of the perovskite treated with 500 μL of anti-solvent was more homogeneous and smooth than that of the perovskite precursor treated with 100 μL, but compact TiO2 was exposed due to the excessive anti-solvent treatment. The low-magnification photograph is shown in the second row, where cracks can be observed on the surface of the perovskite films treated with different anti-solvents. Therefore, the best volumes of the anti-solvent should be addressed. The image above still shows cracks in the perovskite layer even after treatment with 100 μL of IPA. This result can be attributed to the greater solubility of IPA for perovskite precursors than the other anti-solvents.

(Fourth row) Low-magnification SEM top-view images (10000×). The scale bar equals 1 μm. 
The top-view SEM images were used to evaluate the microstructure of the perovskite layer treated with various DEE dropping volumes. As shown in Fig. 4(a)–(e), the surface morphology of the perovskite film treated with 100 μL of DEE is discontinuous and uniform at post-annealing. When the DEE dropping volume was increased to 200 μL, the perovskite grains became smooth. However, it was composed of many small grains within one domain. When the DEE dropping volume was increased to 300 and 400 μL, the topography and the perovskite grains became more smooth and individual, indicating a low grain boundary density of the perovskite layer. By contrast, the perovskite grains became obviously small and random when the DEE dropping volume was further increased to 500 μL. This result may be caused by the removal of a large amount of the perovskite precursor, which resulted in the movement of the solution near the supersaturation zone, causing the formation of several nucleation sites.

Fig. S2 and S3† show the XRD patterns of the Cs5(FA0.83MA0.17)95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 films with different anti-solvents and different volumes of DEE treatment, respectively. After the anti-solvent treatment, all XRD peaks located at 2θ values of 14.2°, 19.5°, 24.0°, 27.9°, 31.4°, 40.2°, 42.7°, and 49.9° indicated the formation of the tetragonal phase perovskite layer. The barely discernible peak at 12.7° resulted from a small amount of PbI2, which is a common residue of the solvent engineering process. Thus, regardless of the anti-solvent, the perovskite was effectively formed. Different from other anti-solvent treatments, the peak of anatase TiO2 at 24.6° and 50.3° can be observed in the XRD diagram when the anti-solvent was IPA. This result can be ascribed to the large number of cracks on the perovskite film surface after treatment with IPA, such that the TiO2 on the lower layer was exposed.
To investigate the chemical states of Cs ions in the perovskite films, we conducted the XPS of the perovskite films. An aluminum Kα monochromator source was used for excitation. Samples were mounted on a sample holder and evacuated in a preparation chamber. For XPS analysis, all devices were prepared on a compact-TiO2 surface. As shown in Fig. S4(a),† the peaks with binding energies of 724.07 and 738.18 eV can be attributed to Cs+ 3d5/2 and Cs+ 3d3/2, respectively.36 The two peaks at 619.18 and 630.58 eV, respectively, in Fig. S4(b)† are attributed to I− 3d5/2 and I− 3d3/2. It can be perfectly fitted into Pb 4f 5/2 and Pb 4f 7/2 peaks with binding energies of 137.61 and 494.27 eV, respectively. The peaks with binding energies of 67.72 and 68.78 eV can be attributed to Br− 3d5/2 and Br− 3d3/2, respectively.37 As a result, all elements can be measured by XPS analysis.
We conducted UV–vis absorption spectroscopy to determine the absorption range and intensity of the mixed cation lead iodide perovskites Cs5(FA0.83MA0.17)95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3. Fig. 5(a) shows the absorption spectra of the perovskite precursor treated with various anti-solvents. The absorption curves covered a wide range of wavelengths from the visible to the near-infrared region. For the perovskite layer treated with anti-solvents, the absorption edges were very sharp, consistent with their crystallinity. Compared to that of the perovskite layer treated with CB, TL, EA, and IPA, the absorbance of the perovskite layer treated with DEE increased, which is attributed to the increased crystallinity and improved surface morphology. Furthermore, a discontinuous and cracked film of the perovskite layer treated with IPA led to a lower relative absorption spectrum. Fig. 5(b) shows the absorption spectra of the perovskite precursor treated with various DEE dropping volumes at post-annealing. When the DEE volume was 200μL, very low absorptions were observed in the range of 400–800 nm. Furthermore, when the perovskite precursors were treated with 400 and 500 μL of DEE, the absorptions in the range of 400–800 nm were very similar. When the perovskite precursor was treated with 300 μL of DEE, the absorption in the range of 400–800 nm was the highest. This result indicates that the perovskite layer has good crystallinity, which could affect the generation of the short-circuit current. The perovskite precursor treated with 100 μL of DEE showed extremely low absorption intensity, which could be attributed to the light scattering effect by residual MAI or pinholes on the perovskite layer surface.38

The photovoltaic characteristics of typical perovskite solar cells (0.06 cm−2) treated with different anti-solvents and different volumes of DEE were primarily evaluated under AM 1.5 G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 and are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). The highest PCE of perovskite devices treated with the anti-solvent DEE are better than that treated with CB, TL, EA or IPA. It shows a 15.47% PCE with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1075 mV, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.78 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.728. From the above evaluation, it is concluded that DEE is a good anti-solvent candidate for the fabrication of perovskite photovoltaic devices, which mainly benefit from the better crystallization properties of the perovskite layer treated with DEE. In this section, we focus on the DEE dropping volume during the perovskite layer preparation process. In order to investigate the effect of DEE dropping volume, the perovskite precursor solution is kept at 30 μl, and other parameters are kept the same. The DEE dropping volumes used in this section are 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 μl. It is evident that the perovskite precursor treated with 300 μl of DEE has the highest power conversion efficiency of 17.38% with Jsc = 21.1 mA cm−2, Voc = 1115 mV, and FF = 0.739. This may be attributed to a flat surface and large individual perovskite grains (lower grain boundary density). In contrast, the perovskite precursor treated with 500 μl of DEE show a low power conversion efficiency of 13.93%. This is attributed to the cracks and the discontinuous perovskite layer. The perovskite precursor treated with 200 μl DEE displays the second highest PCE of 16.19%. It is slightly lower than the perovskite layer treated with 300 μl of DEE since it is composed of many small grains in one domain. Similarly, the small perovskite grains in the case of the perovskite precursor treated with 400 μl of DEE result in a PCE of 16.14%, which is lower than those treated with 300 μl and 200 μl. After the optimization of the amount, we can conclude that the best PCE of the device can be obtained when the volume of DEE is 300 μl.

Fig. 7(a)–(d) and 8(a)–(d) show the device statistics of the key photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE) collected over four different batches. Minimal fluctuations were observed, indicating the excellent reproducibility of these devices. Consistent with the above analysis, photovoltaic devices with DEE treatment exhibited the optimal photovoltaic performance with an average PCE of 15.04%. After optimization of volume dosage, the average PCE reached 16.54%. The photovoltaic parameters of the perovskite device fabricated with various anti-solvents and different volumes of DEE are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Based on the above and photovoltaic characteristic results, we believe that the most suitable anti-solvent for perovskite layer fabrication is that with a low dielectric constant, low dipole moment, low polarity, and low boiling point, just like DEE. It drives the perovskite precursor into the metastable zone instead of the supersaturation zone, leading to increased nucleation rate and grain growth rate. Therefore, the device performs best when the anti-solvent is DEE.

The J–V curves for the photovoltaic devices of Cs5(FA0.83MA0.17)95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 and FA0.83MA0.17Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 PSCs and their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 9(a) and tabulated in Table 3, respectively. The device fabricated with 5% Cs generated the best PCE of 17.38%. Following incorporation of Cs, the champion perovskite device yielded a decreased PCE of 14.68% compared with 5% Cs. As shown in Fig. 9(b), the un-encapsulated devices were stored in a dryer under darkness and the photovoltaic performance was measured regularly under humidity-controlled, ambient conditions (RH 35%–40%). The best devices were then measured every 240 h. The PSC with 5% Cs exhibited a PCE decay feature with parallel trends. Surprisingly, the PCE of the device can even maintain 90% of its initial value after 2 months (the PCE still reached 15.6%), suggesting the excellent long-term stability of the as-fabricated PSCs. Compared with the PSC with 5% Cs, the PSC without Cs showed much less stable behavior. The PCE of the device only maintained 68% of its initial value after 2 months. This biexponential decay behavior meets our expectation.

Fig. 10 illustrates the variation in IPCE versus wavelength responses of the fabricated devices using the Cs5 (MA0.17FA0.83)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite fabricated with different volumes of the anti-solvent. When the DEE volume was 300 μL, the best IPCE value of the cell had a very broad plateau over 90% between 450 and 650 nm, further verifying its excellent photoelectric conversion characteristics compared with other volumes of DEE. The integrated current values calculated from the IPCE spectra were 19.73, 21.09, and 18.43 mA cm−2 when the DEE volumes were 100, 300, and 500 μL, respectively. These results agree well with the corresponding measured photocurrent densities, indicating that the emission of our solar simulator matches well the spectrum of AM 1.5.

To further investigate the charge transfer and carrier recombination characteristics of these PSCs, we performed EIS within the frequency range of 10 mHz to 2 MHz with 10 mV AC amplitude at −0.9 V bias under simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2 irradiance). Fig. 11(b) shows a circuit model that consists of two parallel resistive/capacitive elements connected in series with Rs.39 This model was used to obtain a perfect fit of the experimental parameters listed in Table 4. As shown in Fig. 11(a), two clear semicircles are present in the high- (the first semicircle) and low- (the second semicircle) frequency regions, which are related to the charge transfer (Rtr) and the charge recombination (Rrec) of devices, respectively.40–42 Compared with the devices fabricated with different anti-solvents, the device with DEE treatment has the lowest semicircle and a bigger semicircle in the high- and low-frequency regions, indicating the lowest Rtr and the highest Rrec, respectively. Thus the charge recombination rates in the PSCs treated with DEE are lower than that of the reference PSCs. Meanwhile, the device treated with DEE has the lowest Rs of 16.96 Ω, in good agreement with the highest value of FF (0.728), and other devices had much higher Rs with a relatively lower FF. These results are in accordance with the significantly reduced photovoltaic parameters.

Conclusions
We have successfully developed cesium containing triple cation Cs5(MA0.17FA0.83)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 PSCs with different anti-solvents. The surface morphology and coverage of the perovskite layer can be significantly improved by introducing an anti-solvent (such as DEE) with a low dielectric constant, low polarity, and low boiling point in the drop casting process. This result is attributed to the fact that the anti-solvent drives the perovskite precursor into the metastable zone instead of the supersaturation zone. This phenomenon increases the nucleation rate and grain growth rate consistently at post-annealing. The optimal volume ratio of the perovskite precursor and the DEE anti-solvent is 1:10. With this volume ratio, the PSC can achieve a PCE of 17.34%. Finally, the perovskite device with 5% Cs shows excellent stability for 2 months compared with the device without Cs.
