    , Accepted 18th May 2020First published on 20th May 2020AbstractPorous TiO2 structures have been of great interest in various photocatalytic applications over the past decade. However, the synthetic methods reported so far in the literature are complex and time consuming. This study presents a simple one-pot fabrication method of hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres using a sol–gel process involving CO2 generation in aqueous solution. The CO2 nanobubbles produced in the reaction act as a template for the crystal growth of TiO2 resulting in highly porous hollow nanospheres. The unique nanocrystal structure with a hollow nanosphere centre surrounded by an outer shell of prickle-like porous nanocrystals was observed. The prepared hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres exhibited excellent adsorption properties as demonstrated by the adsorption measurements and dynamic extraction of methylene blue in aqueous solution. Furthermore, the hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres hydrothermally treated at 180 °C exhibit 3.2 times higher photocatalytic performance in the decomposition of methylene blue than the commercial P25 TiO2. The idea of this work provides a new direction for facile green synthesis routes of various metal oxides with cavities, channels or crevices for various technological applications.
Introduction
TiO2 (titanium dioxides, titania) is one of the most studied semiconductors for a wide range of applications including photocatalysis, energy storage and conversion, and sensing.1 An important aspect of the preparation of TiO2 is the method of development of nanostructured TiO2 with optimized shape and structure. Although there are many structurally distinct materials based on TiO2, porous and hollow TiO2 is an important new material that has been renewed in recent years in basic and applied research in the field of material science.2
Recently, novel porous nanostructured photocatalysts are being actively researched for being highly efficient and environment friendly.3 In order to highly activate the photocatalytic function, it is necessary to increase the catalytically active sites by increasing the porosity (i.e., specific surface area) and enhancing the crystallinity.4,5 Generally, upon thermal treatment at a high temperature to increase the crystallinity of TiO2, the specific surface area and porosity decrease. Thus, it is difficult to achieve a synergistic effect having a high specific surface area and high crystallinity.5,6
The liquid phase sol–gel method generally using an organic compound such as a surfactant or a polymer as a template has been reported as a method for producing TiO2 with a high specific surface area.7 However, this method is complicated to remove the template used in the manufacturing process. Therefore, several synthetic routes are being developed to address this problem.
The liquid phase deposition (LPD) process is known as a convenient and low energy sol–gel synthesis route for TiO2 nanocoating on solid substrates and to prepare TiO2 nanoparticles.8 It proceeds by a ligand exchange equilibrium reaction between ammonium hexafluorotitanate ([NH4]2TiF6) and boric acid (H3BO3) in an aqueous solution. A TiF62− complex ion is gradually converted to TiO2 through a ligand exchange reaction in water as shown in eqn (1), which is promoted as H3BO3 removes HF as shown in eqn (2). [NH4]2TiF6 + 2H2O → TiO2 + 2NH4F + 4HF (1)(1) H3BO3 + 4HF → BF4 + H3O+ + 2H2O(2)
We reported the TiO2 nanocoating on MnCO3 microsphere and selective synthesis of porous core–shell or hollow structured MnCO3/TiO2 composites via a two-step LPD process.9 Furthermore, this synthesis concept was extended to a simple one-step synthesis route for the porous Mn-doped TiO2 microspheres as a visible light photocatalyst.10 In this work, we report that the generation of CO2 gas in the reaction contributed to the formation of hollow structures and increased porosity.
Some other similar works have reported hollow and/or porous materials obtained by using gas bubbles. Peng et al.11 reported that ZnSe hollow microspheres were synthesized by crystal growth around the microbubbles of N2 produced in the synthesis reaction. Zhong and coworkers12 suggested the formation of the hollow structures of FeCO3 precursor by using the CO2 bubbles produced from urea as a soft template. Ye and Zeng13 reported the formation of hierarchical hollow manganese silicate in gas bubbles generated from the decomposition of Mn carboxylates. Diao and coworkers14 prepared hollow β-Mo2C/N-doped carbon composite nanospheres using the ethanol–water exchange to generate the nanobubbles.
In this study, we demonstrate a simple one-pot sol–gel route to produce hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres via the modified LPD process that induces the generation of CO2 nanobubbles. The HF generated in the reaction of eqn (1) is neutralized by NaHCO3 as shown in eqn (3), which facilitates the formation of TiO2. Also, the CO2 nanobubble produced in the reaction (eq (3)) acts as a template for hollow porous TiO2 nanosphere formation. (3)
In addition, compared to the conventional LPD TiO2 and commercial P25 TiO2 nanoparticles, the prepared hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres exhibit much higher adsorption and excellent photocatalytic performance. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first trial that uses CO2 bubbles for the direct fabrication of hollow porous pure TiO2 material with a high-photocatalytic performance.
Experimental
Chemicals
Ammonium hexafluorotitanate ([NH4]2TiF6, Mitsuwa's Pure Chem., Japan), sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3, Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Japan), and boric acid (H3BO3, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd, Japan) were used for the synthesis of TiO2 samples. Methylene blue (C16H18N3SCl, Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Japan) was used as a chemical for the adsorption and photodegradation tests. All chemicals were used without further purification. Deionized water was obtained by reverse osmosis followed by ion exchange and filtration using a Milli-Q system. Commercial P25 TiO2 nanoparticles (Aeroxide®P25, 21 nm primary particle size, TiO2 ≥ 99.5% trace metals basis) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
Synthesis of conventional LPD TiO2 nanoparticles
The conventional LPD TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by a similar method in ref. 7. A 0.15 M H3BO3 aqueous solution was directly added to the same volume of a 0.05 M [NH4]2TiF6 aqueous solution. The mixture was maintained at 90 °C for 8 h. Then, the products were washed 5 times with pure water, recovered by filtration and dried under vacuum at room temperature for 24 h.
Synthesis of hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres
Hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres were fabricated in the same way as the synthesis of conventional LPD TiO2 nanoparticles except that H3BO3 (0.15 M) was replaced with NaHCO3 (0.3 M). The mixture was kept at 90 °C for 8 h. The CO2 bubbles were generated after 20 min. The product was then washed 5 times with pure water, recovered by filtration and dried under vacuum at room temperature for 24 h. TiO2 samples were collected after the additional hydrothermal treatment at 130 °C and 180 °C for 8 h.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Smart lab (Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm) operated at 45 kV and 200 mA. XRD scanning was performed under ambient conditions at a scan speed of 10 degrees min−1 with a step of 0.01 degree. A field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM S-5200, Hitachi, Japan) working in a secondary electron mode was used to characterize the morphology. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were taken using an HR-TEM (JEM-3010, JEOL, Japan). For SEM and TEM imaging, powder samples were suspended in ethanol by brief ultrasonication. A few drops of the solution were placed on a carbon tape for SEM or on a holey carbon film-coated copper grid for TEM and ethanol was evaporated under vacuum for 12 h to dry completely. Specific surface area, pore size, and porosity were measured at 77 K using a volumetric adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics BELSORP-mini II, Bell, Japan). Before the adsorption measurements, all samples were outgassed under vacuum for 3 h at 80 °C. The specific surface area was calculated from the adsorption branch in the region of P/P0 between 0.05 and 0.30 using the BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) equation. The non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) was applied for estimating the pore size distributions. The zeta potentials of the prepared TiO2 samples were measured by electrophoretic light scattering (Laser Dopper) using a zeta potential analyser (ELSZ-1000, Otsuka Electronics Co, Japan). The transient photocurrent curves were measured using an electrochemical analyser (CH Instruments, 660C) in a standard three-electrode cell under light irradiation by using a Xe lamp (300 W, Newport 66902). The power density of the light source was 100 mW cm−2. The working electrode was prepared through the uniform dispersion of TiO2 powder (0.5 mg) onto an ITO glass with an active area of 1.0 cm−2. The working electrode was immersed in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution with a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl electrode as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively, under an applied bias of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The absorption characteristics of TiO2 in a UV-visible spectral range were studied by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-2600, Shimadzu, Japan).
Measurement of adsorption property and photocatalytic activity
To investigate the adsorption property of the TiO2 sample, TiO2 was added in a 20 μM of methylene blue (MB) dye solution to be 0.5 mg mL−1. After MB adsorption for 30 min, the particles were precipitated by brief centrifugation and the clear supernatant was subjected to UV-vis spectroscopy measurements (V-570, Jasco Japan). For the measurement of dynamic extraction, 30 μM of MB was dropped onto 10 mg of TiO2 sample fixed to a polypropylene (PP) mesh in a glass Pasteur pipette.
Photocatalysis experiments were also performed using MB dye as a model organic compound. For the photocatalytic experiment, an optical system equipped with a UV lamp emitting 6 W of 365 nm was used, excluding external light. Each TiO2 sample was added in a 40 μM of MB solution in the dark optical system to be 0.5 mg mL−1 and stirred for 30 min to achieve good dispersion and adsorption equilibrium. Then, the mixed solutions were illuminated by the UV lamp. An aliquot of the dye solution was collected every 10 min to precipitate TiO2 particles by centrifugation and the transparent supernatant was measured with a UV-vis spectrometer. The absorbance at 664 nm was measured to determine the concentration of MB. To evaluate the accuracy of the photocatalyst, the photocatalytic process was reused four times to degrade MB under UV light.
Results and discussion
Morphological and structural characteristics of hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres
The texture and morphology of hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres prepared at 90 °C were characterized using SEM and TEM. The SEM image in Fig. 1a shows the morphology of aggregated nanospheres with diameters ranging from 200 nm to 400 nm. The TEM image in Fig. 1b reveals that the well-defined interior of the nanosphere is hollow in contrast to the dark outer shell marked in the figure. Fig. 1c is the magnified TEM image of the outer shell surface of a hollow nanosphere consisting of prickle-like subunit particles. The results of the SAED analysis (Fig. 1d) indicate that the prickle-like particles have an anatase crystal structure. The prickle-like TiO2 nanocrystals on the surface of the hollow nanospheres were further characterized by HR-TEM. The HR-TEM image of the prickle-like nanocrystal in Fig. 1e shows the lattice fringes of anatase {101} with a lattice spacing of 0.35 nm. The high-magnification (×1.2 million) HR-TEM image of prickle-like subunit nanoparticles in Fig. 1f shows some nanoscale vacancies and/or defect sites (i.e. voids) indicated by a white dashed line. To confirm the voids inside the nanoparticles, the sample was mechanically crushed to destroy the hollow structured TiO2 and then examined by SEM. The SEM image in Fig. 1g clearly shows the voids inside the nanoparticle confirming a thin shell structure like an empty broad bean pod (inset of Fig. 1g). The XRD pattern of the hollow TiO2 nanospheres was in good agreement with the anatase peaks (JCPDS No. 84-1285, Fig. 2). The crystal size of the anatase TiO2 of the hollow nanospheres was calculated to be 5.2 nm based on the peak broadening of the {101} reflection using the Debye–Scherrer equation.

Fig. 3a shows dense flower-shaped TiO2 nanoparticles prepared via a conventional LPD process at 90 °C. The size of the LPD TiO2 subunit nanoparticles in Fig. 3b was similar to that of the hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres. However, it turns out that there are no cavities in the structure (Fig. 3c). The SAED and XRD patterns of conventional LPD TiO2 nanoparticles represent typical tetragonal crystalline anatase TiO2 (Fig. 3d and e) which has higher crystallinity and larger crystal size (9.9 nm) than that of hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres (5.2 nm). This is seen as a piece of evidence that spontaneous CO2 generation provides a defect site for TiO2 nanocrystal during the reaction.

The specific surface area and pore distribution of the hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres were investigated by the nitrogen adsorption measurements (Fig. S1a, ESI†). The BET specific surface area was calculated from the adsorption branch of the isotherm. The hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres exhibited a much larger surface area (297 m2 g−1) compared to conventional LPD TiO2 particles (116 m2 g−1). For further elucidation of the porous structure, the pore size distribution was estimated using the NLDFT method. The pore size distribution (Fig. S1b, ESI†) exhibited a sharp and large peak at 1.8 nm with other small peaks at ca. 4.4 nm, 8.9 nm and 14.3 nm, indicating the wide distribution of pore sizes. This may be due to the inconsistent size of the CO2 bubbles.
The pathway of formation of pores and hollow structures

Scheme 1 shows the predicted pathway in which the nanocavities and hollow structures of TiO2 are generated by CO2 bubbles. In addition, the morphological changes of TiO2 with the reaction time were examined by TEM analysis to support our proposed mechanism, and the results are shown in Fig. S2 of ESI.† Upon mixing [NH4]2TiF6 and NaHCO3 solutions, a suspension is formed and CO2 is generated as shown in eqn (3). The produced CO2 molecules are not released immediately from the solution and they coexist with amorphous TiO2 (Fig. S2a, ESI†). The growing CO2 nanobubbles act as a template for the pores of TiO2 nanocrystals in the crystallization process of TiO2 (Fig. S2b, ESI†), which is the step i in Scheme 1. The TiO2 nanocrystals are then arranged and self-assembled into a few hundred nano-meter hollow structures with the help of organized CO2 bubbles as soft templates as shown in step ii of Scheme 1 and Fig. S2c of the ESI.† Finally, the assembled and crystallized hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres are generated and, as a result, aggregates of the hollow porous nanospheres are formed (step iii in Scheme 1).

Hydrothermal treatment of hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres
We also investigated the structural changes of hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres by additional hydrothermal treatment. As shown in the TEM image (Fig. 4a), the hydrothermally treated sample maintained the hollow structure, while the prickle-like TiO2 nanocrystals were converted into highly crystallized pseudo-single-nanocrystal structures as shown in Fig. 4b. Interestingly, some parts of the nanocrystals exhibit porous voids. The crystal size of the hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 130 °C and 180 °C increased to 9.4 nm and 12.0 nm, respectively. On the other hand, the specific surface area of the samples treated at 130 °C and 180 °C decreased to 145 m2 g−1 and 124 m2 g−1, respectively (Fig. S1a, ESI†). The reduction in the specific surface area is due to the crystallization from the amorphous TiO2 to the anatase phase, which can result in the collapse of the porous structure and agglomeration. The peaks related to pore size, as given in Fig. S1b in the ESI,† suggests that the pores partially collapsed and remained after hydrothermal treatment.

Adsorption and photocatalytic properties
Since the adsorption of organic molecules to the TiO2 surface is a pivotal step in photocatalytic decomposition, it is very important to characterize the adsorption properties of organic molecules on the surface of TiO2 samples.15 The overall adsorption properties and photocatalytic activity of hollow porous TiO2 nanosphere samples are evaluated in methylene blue (MB) aqueous solution. The prepared conventional LPD TiO2 nanoparticles and commercial P25 TiO2 nanoparticles were used as comparative materials. The normalized temporal concentration change (C/C0) of MB during photodegradation is proportional to the normalized maximum absorbance (A/A0) and was derived from the change in the absorption profile of the dye at a given time.
The adsorption of MB (20 μM, 10 mL) for each TiO2 samples (5 mg) in the dark was monitored first and a residual concentration fraction of MB was obtained after dark adsorption from UV-vis absorption measurement (Fig. 5a). After equilibrium in the dark for 30 min, almost all dye molecules remained in solution with conventional LPD TiO2 nanoparticles (98.0%) and commercial P25 TiO2 nanoparticles (99.9%), while 99.3% of MB molecules were adsorbed on the hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres. Fig. 5b shows the dynamic extraction of MB (30 μM) by TiO2 samples (10 mg) immobilized on a polypropylene (PP) mesh. For commercial P25 TiO2, the particles were too small (21 nm) to be fixed on the PP mesh. After a certain amount of MB solution was added to each TiO2 sample, the MB solution was passed through the column. Interestingly, the colour of MB was drastically extracted only by the hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres.
 Fig. 5  (a) UV-vis absorption spectral change of MB solution (20 μM) in the presence of various TiO2 samples. (b) Dynamic extraction of MB (30 μM) by hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres and conventional LPD TiO2 nanoparticles. 
In general, the zeta potentials of oxides in an aqueous solution are affected by the dissociation or ionization behaviour of the surface hydroxyl groups and a shift from negative to positive with a decreasing pH.16 The effects of surface chemistry and pH on zeta potentials were studied with acid–base titrations for the prepared TiO2 samples. Typical titration curves are given in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† Both hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres and conventional LPD TiO2 nanoparticles have negative zeta potentials with pH 7. The surface is dominated by a negative charge and these TiO2 samples would exhibit selectivity toward the cationic MB molecules because of the electrostatic attraction. However, the adsorption behaviour was confirmed only in the case of hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres, which suggest that the specific surface area of the particles and the porous structure contribute significantly to the adsorption.
In order to compare the adsorption ability of the hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres with regard to organic dyes with a different charge, an adsorption experiment was performed using MO, which is an anionic dye. As evident in Fig. S4 in the ESI,† the absorption spectra did not change for MO. This selective adsorption feature should be attributed to the fact that the hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres are dominated by negative charges in the system and the negatively charged functional group of MO (–SO3−) is mutually exclusive.
The photocatalytic performance of the prepared samples was tested by the decrease in the absorbance of 40 μM MB solution under UV light irradiation and the results are shown in Fig. 6a. The photocatalytic performance increased in the hydrothermally treated hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres, while the initial adsorption efficiency for MB in the dark decreased. This indicates that the randomly oriented pore channels of the hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres were opened from the surface, thereby improving the accessibility of the diffusing species by thermal treatment.6 The photocatalytic activity of all the TiO2 samples can be quantitatively evaluated by comparing the apparent reaction rate constants, as illustrated in Fig. 6b. The reaction rate constants of the TiO2 samples hydrothermally treated at 130 °C (3.89 × 10−2 min) and 180 °C (9.12 × 10−2 min−1) were significantly improved compared to the pristine hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres (2.50 × 10−2 min−1). The photocatalytic activity of the samples treated at 130° C and 180 °C was 1.3 times and 3.2 times higher than that of commercial P25 TiO2 (2.90 × 10−2 min−1), respectively. In the case of the conventional LPD TiO2 nanoparticles, there was no significant change in absorbance under our experimental conditions. The low photocatalytic activity of the conventional LPD TiO2 obtained is considered to be due to the absence of pores, low specific surface area and low crystallinity.

(b) Pseudo-first-order kinetics plot for the photocatalytic reaction of commercial P25 TiO2 nanoparticles, and pristine and hydrothermally treated hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres. k is the apparent rate constants. 
To obtain information about the stability and reusability of hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres treated at 180 °C, the recycling experiments were conducted. From the results shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI,† after running the degradation reaction for 4 times, the photocatalytic decolourization ratio of MB decreased from 99.9% to 98.7% upon 60 min irradiation under UV light, which is a negligible decline. So, the hydrothermally treated hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres possess excellent photocatalytic stability and reproducibility.
The transient photocurrent response and the time course of TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. 7. Commercial P25 TiO2 nanoparticles have the narrowest band gap around 3.09 eV (Fig. S6 in ESI†), yielding the largest number of photoelectrons and thereby the highest photocurrent. The photocurrent density of hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres hydrothermal treated at 180 °C was measured to be slightly lower. The lower photocurrent density and the high photocatalytic performance of hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres could be explained by the existence of the defect sites (i.e. pores and/or voids). The defect sites in crystalline TiO2 act as the recombination centres to inhibit the photocurrent generation in photovoltaics, but as the electron pool, thereby increasing the active sites to promote the degradation of adsorbed MB during photocatalysis.17
 Fig. 7  Photocurrent density of different TiO2 samples. 
Meanwhile, the photocatalytic activity is mainly related to a balance between the specific surface area and crystallinity; the hydrothermally treated hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres are optimized because of the higher-order structure, relatively large surface area and well-defined anatase crystallinity.18 In addition, the considered reason for their high photocatalytic activity is the unique features of the hollow structure, which include the multiple light reflection effect inside the hollow structure.19 According to the above results, the possible mechanism for the high photocatalytic activity of hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres is proposed in Scheme 2.

Conclusions
Hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres were successfully prepared a via modified LPD process using CO2 nanobubbles generated from the sol–gel reaction as templates for TiO2 crystal growth. The prepared anatase TiO2 exhibited a unique nanocrystalline structure with hollow nanosphere centres surrounded by an outer shell of assembled prickle-like porous nanocrystals. The CO2 nanobubbles generated during the TiO2 crystal growth resulted in the high porosity, reduced nucleation and crystallization of TiO2. The hydrothermal treatment of the pristine hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres reduced the specific surface area, but significantly improved the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. The pores in the TiO2 nanoparticles act as defect sites for the electron pool to promote the degradation of MB during photocatalysis. The hollow porous TiO2 nanospheres are suitable for photocatalytic applications to remove organic pollutants and have much potential in many industrial applications such as dye-sensitized solar-cells and energy storage and conversion.
