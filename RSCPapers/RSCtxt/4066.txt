    , Accepted 30th July 2018First published on 15th August 2018AbstractTo minimize the voltage loss of non-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs), it is important to modulate the energy levels of active materials and thus the photovoltage of the device. In this paper, we report a simple and effective approach to tune the energy levels of a state-of-the-art polymer P3TEA by switching the position of alkyl side chains and carboxylate substituents on the polymer backbone. The resulting polymer P3TAE exhibits a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, contributing to a high open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.20 V and a small voltage loss of 0.54 V when it is blended with a small molecule acceptor (SMA) FTTB-PDI4. Despite a small charge separation driving force, the P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 blend exhibits efficient charge extraction, supported by relatively high external quantum efficiency (EQE) (∼60%) in the corresponding device. In addition, the P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 blend shows relatively high electron mobility and domain purity, leading to a high fill factor (FF) in the device. As a result, the P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4-based solar cell exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.10%, which is one of the highest achieved performances for single-junction OSCs with VOC higher than 1.20 V.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs have attracted considerable academic and industrial interest in the past three decades due to their promising advantages, such as low cost, light weight and mechanical flexibility.1–7 For high performance, an OSC should contain an active layer with the following features: strong absorption over a broad solar spectrum, suitable molecular energy level alignment, and favorable nanoscale morphology for efficient charge generation and transportation.8–10 Consequently, highly efficient OSCs are achievable upon the optimization of three key parameters, EQE, VOC and FF. For fullerene-based OSCs, the increase of OSC performance is mainly driven by the rational design of donor polymers, which leads to the best efficiency of 11.7%.4 However, the performance of this state-of-the-art fullerene OSC is limited by the relatively large voltage loss defined as the difference between the optical bandgap of the donor polymer (1.65 eV) and the VOC in this cell (0.78 V). Further improvement towards more efficient fullerene OSCs is challenging unless the OSC community could reduce the voltage loss without sacrificing the short circuit current (JSC) and FF.11–14
In contrast to fullerene acceptors, non-fullerene acceptors have emerged as promising alternatives due to their prevailing advantages of easy accessibility, strong absorption in both visible and NIR regions, and better tunable functionality.15–32 More importantly, it appears that non-fullerene systems can still work efficiently even with a negligible charge separation driving force.33–35 Therefore, the large voltage losses in fullerene OSC systems could be significantly reduced in non-fullerene OSCs, which is beneficial for achieving larger VOC and thus better device performance.
In order to improve the VOC of the BHJ blend, the energy level alignment between the donor and acceptor materials must be fine-tuned.36–38 Over the past few decades, many research efforts have been devoted to improving the VOC of OSCs by rationally down-shifting the HOMO level of donor polymers. For example, carboxylate substitution was employed by Hou and coworkers to modify P3HT, resulting in a significant enhancement of VOC (from 0.63 V to 0.91 V) and device performance.39 It is also worth mentioning that one of the state-of-the-art studies reported a novel donor polymer P3TEA with a low-lying HOMO level of −5.37 eV.33 When P3TEA was combined with a reported SMA named SF-PDI2, the solar cell achieved a PCE of 9.5% with a high VOC of 1.11 V despite a negligible driving force for charge separation. Consequently, the voltage loss in this system is estimated to be 0.58 V considering that the optical bandgap of P3TEA is 1.69 eV. This work demonstrates the first example of efficient charge separation despite a small driving force. The key factor of the design rationale in this system is the employment of carboxylate substitution on the polymer backbone, which is a promising and effective approach to tune the VOC of non-fullerene OSCs.
Herein, we attempt to further push the energy level limit of P3TEA to obtain a higher VOCvia rational modification. By exchanging the position of alkyl side chains and carboxylate substituents on the backbone of P3TEA, we obtain a novel analogous polymer P3TAE. The major difference between P3TAE and P3TEA is the position of carboxylate substitution, which is found to influence the electrical and optical properties, hole mobility, and aggregation tendency of donor polymers significantly. For P3TAE, the HOMO level is effectively down-shifted by ∼0.18 eV while the LUMO level is slightly up-shifted compared to P3TEA, which is in good agreement with the calculated results. Therefore, P3TAE exhibits a blue-shifted absorption and a larger optical bandgap (1.74 eV). In addition, theoretical calculation demonstrates a more twisted backbone for P3TAE evidenced by the overall smaller dihedral angles in each polymer repeating unit, leading to weaker molecular packing and crystallinity of P3TAE than P3TEA, which is further supported by hole mobility and morphology data of two neat polymer films. When P3TAE is combined with the SMA SF-PDI2, the device exhibits a PCE of 7.12% with a high VOC of 1.19 V, a JSC of 10.98 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.55. Higher efficiency of the cell is realized when P3TAE is combined with another PDI-based SMA FTTB-PDI4. To our surprise, the P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4-based solar cell achieves an enhanced PCE of 8.10% with a higher VOC of 1.20 V and an elevated FF of 0.65, indicating that the voltage loss of this system is effectively reduced to 0.54 V. Importantly, the 8.10% performance is one of the highest achieved values for non-fullerene OSCs with VOC larger than 1.20 V. Further study of morphological characteristics shows that the main reasons for elevated FF and PCE of the P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 blend are its higher electron mobility and domain purity than the P3TAE:SF-PDI2 blend. To conclude, the small modification of the polymer backbone brings about significant differences in molecular properties and device performance, demonstrating that our simple and effective design strategy is promising to push the limit of polymer energy levels to achieve efficient non-fullerene OSCs with higher VOC and lower voltage loss.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of two analogous polymers P3TEA and P3TAE, which exhibit a similar molecular backbone except for the position of the alkyl side chains and the carboxylate substituents. With the alkyl chain on the first thiophene and the carboxylate substituent on the second thiophene (as labelled in Fig. 1a), P3TAE was successfully synthesized according to the synthetic route of P3TEA.33 The length of alkyl chains situated on the first thiophene and the carboxylate substituent (R1 and R2) of P3TAE is further optimized to match the non-fullerene acceptors. After several attempts, when both R1 and R2 are 2-hexyldecyl (2HD) alkyl chains, polymer-based solar cells can achieve the highest performance. High-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was employed to measure the number-average and weight-average molecular weights (Mn and Mw) of P3TAE, which are 94.2 kDa and 214.6 kDa, respectively, demonstrating a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.28 for P3TAE.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of P3TEA, P3TAE, SF-PDI2 and FTTB-PDI4 thin films are shown in Fig. 1c, in which P3TAE exhibits a ∼20 nm blue-shifted absorption compared to that of P3TEA. The film absorption onset of P3TAE and P3TEA as determined in Fig. S1a† is 713 nm and 733 nm, indicating an optical bandgap of 1.74 eV for P3TAE and 1.69 eV for P3TEA.11,14,40 The polymer donor and the SMA exhibit complementary absorption over the range of 400–700 nm, which is expected to efficiently convert the solar energy to electricity in this region (Fig. 1c). The self-aggregation properties of P3TEA and P3TAE are evidenced by temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption as shown in Fig. S2.† During the cooling process of polymer solutions from 100 °C to 20 °C, the absorption spectra are gradually red-shifted, indicating certain aggregation of two polymers. When the temperature of the polymer solution is cooled to room temperature, there is a small peak shoulder appeared at around 690 nm for P3TEA and at 680 nm for P3TAE, indicating π–π intermolecular interaction of two polymers. To clearly illustrate the extent of polymer aggregation of two polymers, we introduce the parameter “relative aggregation strength”,41,42 which is defined as the normalized intensity of each peak (at 631 nm for P3TEA and 608 nm for P3TAE) to the intensity of the maximum absorption at 20 °C. After extracting the data of absorption spectra in Fig. S2a and b,† the “relative aggregation strength” was plotted versus the solution temperature in Fig. S2c.† The aggregation properties of two polymers are similar during the cooling process, yet it could be clearly observed that P3TEA exhibits a stronger tendency of aggregation than P3TAE. P3TEA and P3TAE show similar chemical structures except for the position of carboxylate substitution along the polymer backbone, yet P3TAE exhibits blue-shifted absorption and lower propensity of aggregation compared to P3TEA.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement (Fig. S3†) was employed to get the energy levels of P3TAE. The HOMO and LUMO levels for P3TAE were estimated to be −5.55 and −3.56 eV from the onset of oxidation and reduction potentials. The energy levels of P3TEA, SF-PDI2 and FTTB-PDI4 are directly extracted from our previous paper, which were collected by the same experimental method.33,34 It is interesting to notice that P3TAE exhibits a similar LUMO level to P3TEA, while the HOMO level of P3TAE was decreased by 0.18 eV compared to P3TEA, which is beneficial for achieving a high VOC and low voltage loss in OSCs. Notably, the LUMO–LUMO energy offset between P3TAE and the two SMAs is within 0.10 eV, which is relatively small compared to general OSC systems.
In order to further demonstrate the difference of optical and electrical properties between P3TEA and P3TAE, theoretical calculations of two polymers were conducted by the DFT method at a level of B3LYP/6-31G*. For simplification, all the alkyl chains were replaced with methyl groups and the corresponding energy distributions of P3TEA and P3TAE are shown in Fig. S4.† From the calculation results, the LUMO levels of P3TEA and P3TAE are −2.96 and −2.91 eV, respectively. However, P3TAE exhibits a deeper HOMO level of −5.15 eV than P3TEA (−5.08 eV). Overall, P3TAE exhibits a shallower LUMO level but a deeper HOMO level than P3TEA, which is in good agreement with the aforementioned CV measurements. One possible explanation is that for P3TAE, the electron-withdrawing thiophene-carboxylate unit is surrounded by two neighboring thiophenes, which are the donor part of P3TAE. It can be interpreted that the electron-withdrawing carboxylate substitution has a major influence on the donor unit of P3TAE, leading to a distinct decrease of the HOMO level. However, for P3TEA, there are both a donor unit (thiophene) and an acceptor unit (difluorobenzothiadiazole, ffBT) on two sides of the thiophene-carboxylate, and hence the electron-withdrawing carboxylate substitution relatively has a weaker effect on the donor part and a stronger effect on the acceptor part compared to P3TAE. Therefore, P3TEA exhibits a shallower HOMO level than P3TAE. Importantly, the electron-withdrawing ability of the thiophene-carboxylate unit is much weaker than ffBT, suggesting that the LUMO level of P3TEA is mainly determined by ffBT and the thiophene-carboxylate unit induces a limited decrease of the LUMO level of P3TEA. To conclude, P3TEA shows an up-shifted HOMO level but a slightly down-shifted LUMO level than P3TAE, leading to a decreased optical bandgap for P3TEA.
The optimal structural conformations of two polymer dimers were also calculated and are shown in Fig. 2 with their respective dihedral angles between two adjacent ffBT units listed. For P3TEA, the C–C–C–S, C–C–C–C, S–C–C–S and C–C–C–C dihedral angles between two adjacent ffBT units are 179°, 163°, 165° and 180°, respectively, which are 176°, 158°, 167° and 179° for P3TAE, demonstrating a more twisted molecular backbone for P3TAE. A good polymer donor in the non-fullerene OSC system should keep reasonable solubility in common solvents for the device processing while simultaneously maintaining certain molecular crystallinity to guarantee a favorable blend morphology. As the backbone of P3TAE is more twisted, the length of R1 and R2 should be slightly shorter than those of P3TEA to achieve a better balance between polymer solubility and crystallinity. After several trial and error attempts, 2-hexyldecyl and 2-hexyldecyl alkyl chains are proven to be the optimal choice for R1 and R2 of P3TAE to achieve the best performing OSCs.

To gain more insights into the difference of molecular packing and crystallinity between P3TEA and P3TAE, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was implemented on two polymer neat films. From the 2D GIWAXS patterns in Fig. 3, P3TEA exhibits a higher order of lamellar stacking and even a (300) stacking peak is slightly visible in the out-of-plane direction. The π–π stacking distance of P3TAE and P3TEA is 3.65 Å and 3.57 Å, respectively, indicating closer molecular packing of P3TEA. Also, P3TAE exhibits a shorter (010) coherence length of 30 Å than P3TEA (38 Å). The above GIWAXS data demonstrate weaker aggregation of P3TAE than P3TEA, which is mainly attributed to the more twisted molecular backbone of P3TAE. To further verify this, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was employed to measure the charge mobility of two donor polymers (Fig. S5a†). The hole mobility for the P3TAE neat film is calculated to be 6.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is lower than that of P3TEA (7.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), showing good accordance with the above GIWAXS data (Fig. 3).

To investigate the device performance of non-fullerene OSCs based on the newly designed polymer P3TAE, an inverted structure of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active layer/V2O5/Al was fabricated. The details of the device fabrication are shown in the ESI.† When P3TAE is blended with a reported SMA SF-PDI2, upon the optimization of the D/A weight ratio and the processing conditions, the most efficient device shows a PCE of 7.12%, with a high VOC of 1.19 V, a JSC of 10.98 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.55 (Table 1, Fig. 4a). Further optimization of the device performance was realized when P3TAE was combined with another SMA named FTTB-PDI4.34 The P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4-based device exhibits a high VOC of 1.20 V, a JSC of 10.47 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.65, leading to an elevated performance of 8.10% (Table 1, Fig. 4a), which is one of the highest achieved values of single-junction OSCs with ≥1.20 V VOC to date. Considering that the optical bandgap of P3TAE is 1.74 eV, the voltage loss in our system is effectively reduced to 0.54 V. For a consistent comparison of our work with other systems with low voltage losses, we measured the bandgap of P3TAE based on fitting equations of absorption and emission originating from Marcus theory.33,43 In this way, the bandgap of P3TAE is determined to be 1.81 eV as the crossing point of normalized polymer absorption and emission curves (Fig. S1b†), which demonstrates a voltage loss of 0.61 V for our P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4-based blend. In addition, even though the driving force in the P3TEA:SF-PDI2 and P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 blends is nearly zero, the charge generation of our systems is still efficient evidenced by the considerable response of EQE spectra over the region of 300–700 nm. In particular, the high EQE value (up to ∼60% for P3TEA:SF-PDI2 and P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4, Fig. 4b) of two devices in the 550–700 nm region, which belongs to absorption range of P3TAE, indicates that photons absorbed by P3TAE are efficiently converted to electrons despite the negligible driving force. The current density integrated from the EQE spectrum was 10.46 mA cm−2 for the P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4-based device, validating the accuracy of our device measurement.

The OSC performance of our P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 device was also compared with that of the reported P3TEA:FTTB-PDI4-based system as shown in Fig. S6a.† The P3TEA:FTTB-PDI4-based cell exhibits a lower VOC of 1.13 V and a similar FF of 0.66, yet a higher JSC of 13.96 mA cm−2 compared to the P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 system, leading to its generally higher solar cell efficiency of 10.33%. The higher current and performance of the P3TEA:FTTB-PDI4-based device may be ascribed to the red-shifted absorption of P3TEA and thus relatively stronger photon harvesting ability of the cell in the long-wavelength region. As the optical bandgap of P3TEA is 1.69 eV, the P3TEA:FTTB-PDI4-based cell presents a larger voltage loss of 0.56 V. As a result, though our P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 device exhibits a lower performance than the P3TEA:FTTB-PDI4-based cell, it realizes both a higher VOC and a lower voltage loss through simple but efficient modification of the donor polymer structure, which opens up many possibilities to pursue a low voltage loss for efficient OSCs at the material synthesis level.
Compared with the P3TAE:SF-PDI2-based device, the prevailing device parameter of the P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4-based one is the enhanced FF, which could be explained by the relatively higher electron mobility of FTTB-PDI4 than SF-PDI2 in the blend. SCLC measurements show that the electron mobilities of P3TAE:SF-PDI2 and P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 blends are calculated to be 1.43 × 10−4 and 5.52 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the hole mobilities of the two blends are 5.37 × 10−4 and 5.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. S5b and c†). The four times higher electron mobility and balanced hole/electron mobility in the P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 blend contribute to efficient charge transportation and collection in the vertical direction of the device and thus higher FF and PCE of the device.
The 2D GIWAXS patterns of P3TAE:SF-PDI2 and P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 blends were also characterized as shown in Fig. S7,† which demonstrated a similar ordering of the donor polymer and small molecules in the two blend films. To achieve more insights into the performance difference of two systems, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) were conducted to investigate their device morphology. The height and phase images of two blends are shown in Fig. 5a, demonstrating quite a uniform and smooth surface without clear phase separation. The R-SoXS profiles of P3TAE:SF-PDI2 and P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 blends are depicted in Fig. 5b to provide quantitative morphological information. It can be observed that there is a peak at 0.236 nm−1 for the P3TAE:SF-PDI2 device, indicating a small domain size of 13.2 nm assuming a two-phase morphology, whereas P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 exhibits a comparatively larger domain size of 23.5 nm. However, P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 was found to exhibit a much higher domain purity than P3TAE:SF-PDI2 (1 vs. 0.89), which is in good agreement with the aforementioned higher electron mobility of the P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 blend. Though P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 exhibits larger domain sizes that may lead to slightly decreased JSC of the device, the enhanced domain purity contributes to the remarkable elevation of FF from 0.55 to 0.65, which brings about an overall enhanced PCE for P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4-based solar cells.

Finally, the dependence of JSC on the light intensity was measured to reveal the bimolecular recombination behavior in the P3TAE:SF-PDI2 and P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 blends (Fig. 5c). The relationship between JSC and the light intensity can be expressed as JSC ∝ Pα, where P is the light intensity and α is the recombination index. Under ideal conditions, if all the free charges can be collected by two electrodes before recombination, α should equal 1. However, some degree of bimolecular recombination in the OSC systems should lead to an α value of <1, and the more severe the bimolecular recombination is, the lower the α value would be.44 As revealed in Fig. 5c, the calculated α values for P3TAE:SF-PDI2 and P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 blends are 0.9466 and 0.9644, respectively. Therefore, the P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 blend exhibits more suppressed bimolecular recombination than P3TAE:SF-PDI2, which may be ascribed to the relatively higher domain purity of the P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 blend. This provides another explanation for the better performance of P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4-based OSCs.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we synthesized a new terthiophene-based polymer P3TAE via the exchange of the position of carboxylate substituents and the alkyl side chains on the backbone of a reported polymer P3TEA. Compared with P3TEA, the obtained polymer P3TAE shows an ∼0.18 eV down-shifted HOMO level, ∼20 nm blue-shifted absorption and a larger optical bandgap of 1.74 eV. Besides, P3TAE exhibits a more twisted molecular backbone than P3TEA, leading to weaker molecular aggregation and crystallinity of P3TAE. Our simple and effective design strategy demonstrates its great potential to effectively tune the properties of donor polymers. When P3TAE is combined with two SMAs SF-PDI2 and FTTB-PDI4, P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4 can obtain a higher PCE of 8.10% than the P3TAE:SF-PDI2-based blend (7.12%). Besides, P3TAE:FTTB-PDI4-based devices can achieve a VOC of up to 1.20 V, indicating a small voltage loss of 0.54 V. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 8.10% is one of the highest achieved values in single-junction OSCs with a high VOC of ≥1.20 V. Importantly, the driving force between the polymer and SMA is negligible, yet it does not cause any negative effect on the charge generation and transportation. These results demonstrate that our novel polymer is promising to achieve efficient non-fullerene OSCs with a high VOC and low voltage loss.
