    AbstractRecently, undoped semiconductors have been pushed to the frontiers of diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) since no spurious ferromagnetism (FM) signal from metal segregation occurs. However, some aspects still remain untouched in undoped semiconductors nanostructures, including: 1) the evolution of spin moments during the fabrication process; 2) possible intrinsic relationship between the magnetic properties and morphological features, the latter being also dependent on formation process. In this article, we synthesized undoped InN nanostructures and observed a gradual magnetic transition from diamagnetic to FM, and an obvious morphology evolution from tube-shape to wire-shape products with the increase of nitridation time. It is speculated that increasing surface defects such as N vacancies in the morphology transition process are the intrinsic causes for the enhanced FM order with increase of nitridation time. The results provide some useful clues in understanding the true magnetic origin in nanostructured DMSs and reported properties inconsistencies in nanostructured materials.
I. Introduction
Nowadays, researchers' interests in nanospintronics provide a strong motivation to investigate the fabrication and magnetic properties of semiconductor nanostructures as they integrate the long-range magnetic order and the low dimensional features.1–3 For nanostructured semiconductors, similar to bulk materials, Curie temperature (Tc) at or above room temperature (RT), and spin polarization in the majority carrier band, are still the essential requirements for the applications of diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs). However, increasing inconsistencies in reported properties and debates regarding the nature origin of ferromagnetism (FM) order have long been making researchers doubt the true existence of intrinsic long-range magnetic order in semiconductor nanostructures, which are usually obtained by doping transition metal (TM) elements into the semiconductor lattices.4–6
Hence, the doping non-TM elements or even undoped semiconductors have been pushed to the frontiers of DMSs.2,7 Especially, without the disturbance of spurious FM signal from TM elements segregation and related secondary phases, undoped semiconductor nanostructures are thought as clean systems for gaining insights into the origin of FM order. By far, several undoped nanostructured DMSs have been investigated while some aspects still remain untouched,7–10 including: 1) the evolution of the spin moments in low dimensional magnetic materials during the fabrication process; 2) the possible intrinsic relations between the magnetic properties and morphological features of the nanostructured DMSs, the latter being also dependent on the formation process. These unsolved questions are undoubtedly vital for controlling the properties, especially the magnetic features in the fabrication of nanoelectronic devices and understanding the nature FM origin in DMSs. To this end, we choose InN as the first attempt to address these issues.
InN, an important narrow-gap semiconductor (∼0.7 eV at 300 K) with lots of significant applications in light-emitting diodes (LED), high efficiency solar cells, and high-frequency field-effect transistors (FET), is an ideal object to be investigated since various InN low dimensional structures can be facilely approached.11,12 InN has a hexagonal crystal structure (P63mc, No.186) with lattice constants of a = 3.5378 Å and c = 5.7033 Å. In this article, we reported a gradual magnetic transition from diamagnetic (DM) to FM, and increased photoluminescence (PL) intensity with the increase of nitridation time (tN) in InN low dimensional systems. It is revealed that the robust FM order can be successfully established while the FM evolution is very dependent on the fabrication process in undoped nanostructured InN. The defects including N vacancies etc. serve as the key role in determining the physical properties, especially the magnetic and luminescent features. This is particular true for nanostructured DMSs as lots of defects are inevitably present due to their high ratios of surface/volume. These results provide some useful clues in understanding the magnetic origin and reported properties inconsistencies in nanostructured DMSs. This study also suggests that the possible impact on performance of the nanoelectronic device that originates from nanostructured architectural materials themselves should be taken into account in the practical applications.
II. Experiment
Synthesis
In a typical run, high-purity In2O3 (99.999%, 0.1000 g), supplied by Alfa Aesar, was loaded into a 10 cm quartz boat in a conventional tube furnace in contact with a thermocouple to assure accurate temperature control. The quartz tube was degassed and then high purity argon (99.999%) flowed at 50 sccm for 40 min while the temperature was ramped to a desired temperature of 973 K. The temperature was held while 200 sccm ammonia (99.999%) as atomic nitrogen precursors and 80 sccm nitrogen gas (99.999%) as the carrier gas were flowed over the quartz boat for 2.5 h, 3 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 16 h, and 24 h, respectively. Then power was shut off and the furnace was cooled down to RT naturally. The samples were collected from the surface of the quartz boat.
Characterizations
Phase identifications were performed on X-ray diffractometer (Philips X'PERT MPD) with a Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The morphology of the products were examined by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, FEI XL 30 S-FEG) and semiquantitative composition analysis was conducted using an energy-dispersive spectroscope (EDX) attached to the FE-SEM with an Oxford energy-dispersive X-ray analysis system. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of samples were observed on a JEOL 2010 microscope. Raman scattering spectrum was measured on a multichannel modular triple Raman system (JY-T64000) using a 532 nm laser as excitation source. The sample (mass ∼30 mg) was wrapped by capsule for magnetic measurement. The temperature dependent magnetization (M–T) measurements were performed with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID, MPMS-7, Quantum Design) in the range from 5 K to 300 K and in the field of 1 kOe. Magnetization versus applied magnetic field (M–H) were measured on SQUID in the range of 0∼±5000 Oe. The photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed using 532 nm as the excitation source.
III. Results and discussion
The phase identification was performed on a high-resolution X-ray diffractometer. Fig. 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the nitridation products with various tN from 2.5 h to 24 h. Vertical bars at the bottom are expected Bragg positions for InN (ICDD-PDF: 65-3412, P63mc, space number: 186). XRD patterns exclusively show all the diffraction peaks corresponding to the hexagonal InN. No contribution from impurities or other secondary phases within the sensitivity of X-ray diffractometer (Philips X'PERT MPD) can be detected. Here, one can see the absolute structure transition from cubic In2O3 (ICDD-PDF: 06-0416) to hexagonal InN cell can be completed within 2.5 h, and further increase in tN do not change the crystal structure. RT Raman spectra of as-prepared products (Fig. 1b) show the fingerprint modes for hexagonal InN, that are the prominent modes named A1 transverse optical (TO), E2 phonons, large-wave vector A1(LO)-phonon-plasmon (A1-LPP−) coupled mode, located at ∼450 cm−1, ∼490 cm−1 and ∼580 cm−1, respectively, which provide further evidence to demonstrate the formation of single-phase InN crystal structure.13,14

Fig. 2a shows the magnetization hysteresis loops (M–H) measured at 5 K in the range −6 kOe < H < 6 kOe. Only DM characters can be found in the pristine In2O3 as a result of the superposition signal of paramagnetic In2O3 and DM capsule. After the nitridation of In2O3 for 2.5 h, very weak FM signals were detected in low magnetic field range. With tN extending to 3 h, FM signals enhanced and hysteresis loops showed an anticlockwise rotation trend. Further extending tN, especially after 4 h, a distinct hysteresis loop as indicated by filled triangles (pink color) can be observed clearly in the range −1.5 kOe < H < 1.5 kOe, while DM component was suppressed and only can be seen in high field range. With further increase of tN, FM order gradually dominated the as-prepared InN. Correspondingly, the remanent magnetization (Mr) with tN larger than 4 h was exactly estimated and also increased with the increase of tN (Fig. 2b). Fig. 3 show the temperature dependence of magnetization (M–T) curves of InN with various tN. The smooth and featureless curves reveal the absence of any secondary or tiny parasitic magnetic phases for all InN samples, in well agreement with previous XRD and Raman results. These magnetic results undoubtedly show the FM order can be gradually established in non-doped InN low dimensional structures. In other words, it was found that without the disturbance of magnetic impurities, the long-range magnetic order is very dependent on synthesis process, for instance the tN, in low dimensional semiconductor systems, the case of undoped InN. Similar results have been found in other low dimensional semiconductor systems.3,7,9 These novel results inspire us to probe the possible intrinsic relations between magnetic properties and other features, which are also strongly dependent on the fabrication conditions, such as reaction time, reaction temperature, and gas flux etc.15–21 To investigate this among them will benefit the fabrication of nanoelectronic devices and understand the true origin of FM order in undoped DMSs. Here, we pay attention to the morphological characters of the InN nanostructures prepared by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method which is very sensitive to the reaction time. Fig. 4 is a series of SEM images, showing the morphology dependence on tN. In2O3 nanoparticles (∼80–100 nm in dia.) [Fig. 4(a)] were converted into tube-shaped InN at tN = 2.5 h [Fig. 4(b)]. Then, mixed morphological products including InN microtubes and nanowires etc. were found in the products after nitriding for tN = 3 h, 4 h, and 8 h, respectively [see Fig. 4(c), (d), (e).]. Tube-shaped InN gradually vanished while InN nanowires dominated the samples with tN increase from 12 h [Fig. 4(f)] to 24 h [Fig. 4(h)]. InN nanowires with the tN of 24 h were found to exhibit the most robust FM behavior, suggesting the presence of inner relations between magnetic properties and morphological features. Before to unveil the possible relation, FM origin in as-prepared undoped InN nanostructures should be investigated. We firstly take into account the purity of the starting materials, which is critical to determine the magnetic features of the samples, as there have been several reports on the discovery of organic magnets but included the trace amount of FM metal nanoclusters.22 In this study, the most convincing evidence against the impurity role is that the pristine, In2O3, do not exhibit any FM signal and thus, the possible magnetic impurity effect from starting materials could be ruled out. So, the clear hysteresis loops can only be ascribed to the true features of the nanostructured InN. In as-prepared InN samples, three possible sources should be considered for inducing FM order: (1) the substitution of O by N. Unpaired electrons will generate when N enters into In2O3 lattice to replace O as N has one less electron than O in their outermost electronic shell. Then, these unpaired electrons were prompted to a higher orbital enabling it to participate in the long-range magnetic ordering as proposed by Andriotis et al.23 (2) the structural defects as produced in the structural transition from cubic cell (In2O3, ICDD-PDF: 06-0416) to hexagonal cell (InN, ICDD-PDF: 65-3412) during the nitriding process. These structural defects can be vacancies (V), antisites (NIn, InN) and interstitial defects (Ini, Ni) etc. Particularly, V defects have be demonstrated their special role on the FM origin.9,10 For instance, Dev et al.' work showed that Vcation could induce the intrinsic FM in undoped III–V nitrides.7 Moreover, the broaded Raman peaks (Fig. 1b) with asymmetric line shape reveal the presence of large scales of defects since the phonons can be trapped by defects and then, an uncertainty in the wave vector of the phonons will generate, that contributes for the broadening.13 (3) Although O related impurity phases were not detected by XRD and Raman analysis, the presence of O element cannot be eliminated since the oxides (In2O3) were involved as precursors and the formation of amorphous InNxOy in the surface of InN has been observed by several research groups.24,25 So, the existence of O related defects such as ON and Oietc. in obtained InN can also not be excluded completely.

III–V nitrides are known to possess lots of VN defects, particular in nanostructured ones via the CVD route. Here, we use energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) to approximately evaluate the atomic ratio of In/N of the as-prepared products. Table 1 shows that In/N values increased, that is, VN increased with the prolongation of tN. We notice that surface/volume ratios increased as the morphological evolution from tube-shaped InN [Fig. 4(b)], to the coexistence of InN nanotubes and nanowires [Fig. 4(c), (d), (e)], and finally to InN nanowires [Fig. 4(f), (g), (h)] with the extension of tN. During this process, it is easy to understand that the quantities of VN defects will inevitably increase due to the increasing ratios of surface/volume, which will lead the facile formation of more VN defects on surface of InN products. It should be noted that trace In particles can be observed by the naked eyes in as-prepared InN samples and thus, the high In/N ratios only reveal the increasing trend of VN than the actual compositions. In fact, Random HRTEM image (Fig. 5) of InN with the tN of 24 h, provides an intuitionistic evidence to demonstrate the presence of defects in which double-period lattice stripe images were observed in area “B”, while the single period lattice stripe images were found in “A” and “C” areas, indicating the existence of large scale of V defects, which may be the VN. Obviously, detailed characterizations for the defects in InN are still required.

To further evaluate the defects quantities in nanostructured InN samples, photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed. More recently, the true band edge emission for InN is reported to locate in ∼0.70–0.90 eV than the previously accepted value of ∼1.7–1.9 eV.26–29 Other peaks in PL spectra are reported to relate with various types of defects. In Fig.6, the PL peaks centered at ∼750 nm, reveal the defects luminescence is the main mechanism in as-prepared InN.30 Furthermore, PL intensity gradually enhanced while no obvious blue- or red-shift was found, suggesting the defects types contributing for luminescence has no changes while defects concentration/quantities increased greatly with increase of tN. The PL spectra are well consistent with the EDX analysis results. In such In-rich InN, defects including VN, InN, Ini, ON and Oietc. may all have various degrees of contribution for observed PL emission. However, O related defects are not worthy to be considered since the O contents in InN will be always decreased to a certain level in continuous flowing NH3 atmosphere and thus, the enhancement in FM order and PL intensity with increase of tN that origin from ON or Oi should be excluded. Here, only the VN exhibits an increasing trend with increase of tN as mentioned above. Combining the enhancement in FM and PL intensity with the evolution of morphological features, it is speculated that the increasing VN with increase of tN serves as the key role in inducing more unpaired spins, forming long-range magnetic order and enhancing the PL intensity. Although the detailed defects are still unclear, large quantities of defects in undoped InN should be responsible for these novel physical properties changes. In other words, with increase of tN, the morphology changes should foster the creation of more defects as evidenced by PL spectra. As for the natural mechanism, it is not well understood at the moment while P. Dev et al.' theoretical investigations might be applicable to undoped InN in which the vacancies favor the formation of local moment and induce the long-range spin couplings in nitrides through long tail of defective wave function.8 True mechanism deserves further studies. As an initial study to probe the inner relation between morphological features and magnetic properties in nanostructured DMSs, this study reveal the influence on the nanoelectronic device that origin from nanostructured architectural materials should be considered.

IV. Summary
In conclusion, the robust FM order was observed in nanostructured undoped InN that was converted by nitriding paramagnetic In2O3 nanoparticles under NH3. The conversion process is accompanied by a morphological change with an increasing ratio surface/volume. The chemical analysis and PL measurements show the defect density increases with the extension of nitriding duration, tN. It is speculated that the increasing defects density of VN are responsible for the enhanced long-range spin order and PL intensity. This study also provides unambiguous evidence that defects can induce FM in undoped narrow-gap semiconductors, the case of InN. It also implies that the FM can be enhanced or suppressed by varying/modulating the defect density, suggesting the properties of nanostructured DMSs is very sensitive to the fabrication processes.
