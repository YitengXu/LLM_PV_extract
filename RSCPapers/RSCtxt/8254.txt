The prototype lateral metal–semiconductor–metal photodetector based on the as-prepared crystal exhibits a responsivity of up to 11.3 A W−1, a photogain of 31.84, and a high-speed photoresponse with a time constant of 354 μs.
Introduction
High mobility and long-term reliability are essential requirements for the practicality of electronic devices. With the growing study on flexible electronics,1,2 researchers begin to realize that despite the attractive inherent flexibility of the organic semiconductors,1,3 inorganic materials are still worth being taken into account because of their high mobility and stability.4 Among the numerous solutions for acquiring the flexibility of fragile inorganic semiconductors,5–10 atomically thick two-dimensional (2D) materials exfoliated from bulk precursors have recently attracted extensive attention owing to their low cost and easy access to mass production. Furthermore, 2D materials can not only retain the merits of their bulk counterparts, but also may exhibit unique electronic and optical properties, which will open up a perspective for novel functional devices.10–12 The materials, which can be easily exfoliated into 2D nanosheets (the so-called layered materials), are generally characterized by strong in-plane chemical bonding and weak van der Waals inter-plane interactions in crystal structures.13 Therefore, it can be expected that by taking advantage of those characteristics, we can realize the 2D anisotropic growth of layered materials in a suitable environment and thus directly achieve large-area free-standing ultrathin single crystals. When the thicknesses of the single crystals are limited to several microns, they are likely to exhibit excellent mechanical flexibility and bendability.6,14 Moreover, with respect to their high performance and good processability, large-area single crystals should be considered as a superior option for flexible electronic devices.
PbI2 is a layered semiconductor material (Eg ∼ 2.2–2.55 eV) with a repeating unit consisting of one layer of close-packed Pb atoms sandwiched between two layers of I atoms,13,15 and is typically employed for room-temperature X-ray and γ-ray detections.16,17 Generally, PbI2 single crystals are grown by several high-temperature methods.15 However, these methods are not designed to grow thin single crystals on the basis of the anisotropic nature of the atom bonding in layered materials. In this work, we have proposed a solution-based method to grow free-standing ultrathin PbI2 single crystals through controlling the charge state of the basic growth unit. The obtained PbI2 single crystals are several microns thick and exhibit good flexibility. A prototype photodetector with the metal–semiconductor–metal configuration has been constructed to demonstrate the remarkable photoelectrical properties of the single crystals. The fabricated device shows excellent operating characteristics of high responsivity, high photogain and fast response speed. Accordingly, it can be inferred that these flexible ultrathin PbI2 crystals may have great potential to be used for flexible electrical or optoelectrical devices, such as solar cells, large-area photodetectors, etc., and could be further applied to direct-conversion digital X-ray detectors.
Experimental section
Crystal growth
The ultrathin PbI2 single crystals were grown by a temperature gradient method in aqueous solution. Compared with the previous solution methods,18 our scheme can control the growth habits of PbI2 and thus obtain large area ultrathin crystals. Our focus is the charge state of the basic growth unit in solution, which can be manipulated by suitable mineralizers.19 According to the crystal structure of PbI2, the (001) plane tends to be terminated by I−, which is less likely to absorb negative ions. Thus, altering the charge state of the basic growth units to negative can effectively restrict the growth rate along the [001] direction. Therefore, we choose KNO3 as the mineralizer. In the solution environment, the presence of NO3− ions with high concentration may lead to the formation of negatively charged intermediate complex [PbI2(NO3)]2−, which could increase the solubility of PbI2, and at the same time, enhance the two dimensional anisotropic growth of the single crystals (see details in the ESI,† Fig. S1).
The growth was performed in a quartz jar with a diameter of 15 cm and a height of 20 cm. A Teflon baffle plate with holes was positioned 12 cm above the bottom to control the solution flow of the convection. The temperature of the dissolution zone was set to 90 °C, and the temperature difference between the growth zone and the dissolution zone was set to 20 °C. The nutrient was prepared from 99.9% purity PbI2 powder, which was sintered for 2 hours at 300 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere after being pressed. During the growth, the solution was continuously stirred at 25 rpm. After 2 days, ultrathin transparent orange-yellow plates started to appear on the baffle plate through self-nucleation and further growth processes. The thicknesses of the single crystals were characterized on a Bruker Dektak XT stylus profiler.
Single crystal characterization
X-ray powder diffraction was used to identify the crystal structures and phase compositions of the samples. Diffraction data were collected on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer with an X'Celerator detector using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV × 40 mA). The 2θ scanning range was from 5° to 65° with a scanning speed of 4° min−1 in the continuous mode. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were done on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250 instrument with Al Kα source. All the binding energies were calibrated by the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV of the surface adventitious carbon. The UV-vis transmittance spectrum of the thin crystal was measured using a Shimadzu UV-2550 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The low-temperature PL spectrum was recorded on an Edinburgh FLS920 spectrofluorometer with a picosecond pulsed diode laser EPL-375 (50 ps pulses at 375 nm with 0.15 mW average power and 20 MHz repetition rate) as the excitation resource.
Device measurements
The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the photodetectors were recorded by using a Keithley sourcemeter model 2612 and a GPIB data transfer card. The spectral responses for different wavelengths were measured by using a 500 W Xenon lamp with a monochromator (Omni-λ300, Zolix) as the monochromatic light source. The irradiance of the incident light was measured using a Newport optical power meter (Model 1936-R). The response times of the device were obtained by measuring the voltage variation in a 2 MΩ load resistance in the test circuit. An oscilloscope (Agilent DSO-X 4002A) was used to record the voltage change of the series resistance. The incident light pulses were provided by a 515 nm laser diode, which was driven using a waveform generator (Agilent 33500B Series). The width of the light pulse was carefully adjusted to ensure complete saturation of the photocurrent.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and b show photographs of the as-grown ultrathin PbI2 crystals by a temperature gradient method in aqueous solution. The typical thicknesses of the crystals are about 2 to 15 μm, which are much thinner than those of slices ever obtained from bulk crystals by the mechanical cutting method.15 As shown in Fig. 1b, the ultrathin crystal of several micrometers thick exhibits good mechanical flexibility and bendability. The XRD pattern in Fig. 1c indicates that the thin crystals are crystallized in a hexagonal 2H structure and only (00l) diffraction peaks appear, which further confirms that the obtained thin plates are single crystals oriented in the [001] direction.20

The physiochemical properties of the single crystals are further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis transmittance spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Fig. 2a and b give high-resolution XPS spectra of I 3d and Pb 4f, respectively. The photoelectron peaks assigned to I 3d5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 core levels appear at the binding energies of 619.6 and 138.6 eV, respectively, which is in good agreement with the literature values for bulk PbI2.21 Additionally, in order to gain the electronic properties of the PbI2 single crystals, we have also measured the valence band (VB) XPS spectrum. Fig. 2c depicts the VB XPS spectrum of an ultrathin PbI2 single crystal. According to the band structure computation, the observed peak in the region from 0.7 eV to 5.2 eV corresponds to the uppermost VB consisting of the 6s state of lead with some admixture of the iodine 5p state.22,23 The energy difference between the Fermi level and the valence band maximum (VBM) is measured to be about 0.76 eV.24 Considering that the Eg of PbI2 is about 2.53 eV at 4.2 K,23 the Fermi level of the PbI2 single crystal locates closer to the VBM than to the conduction band minimum (CBM). Thus, it can be speculated that PbI2 tends to be a weak p-type or intrinsic semiconductor, which is consistent with the previous results.25

Fig. 3 presents the low-temperature PL spectrum and the room-temperature (RT) UV-vis absorbance spectrum (the inset). The PL spectrum of the as-grown thin PbI2 single crystal is recorded at 13.8 K by using a 375 nm picosecond pulsed laser as the excitation resource. As shown in Fig. 3, the spectrum is remarkably similar to that of the bulk single crystals grown by the conventional Bridgman method.26 The observed rich fine structures of the spectrum could indicate the high quality of the single crystals in terms of crystal structure and homogeneity. The peaks at 496.3 nm (FE) and 497.4 nm (BE) are originated from the free exciton emission and bound exciton emission, respectively,27 and the broader band (labelled D–A) peaked at 510 nm is assigned to the recombination of the donor–acceptor pairs, such as the association of an iodine vacancy and a lead vacancy.23 In addition to the main D–A peak, three phonon replicas can be clearly observed. The emission peak I, which is located between the D–A peak and the BE peak, may be correlated with the shallow levels introduced by the unintended impurities, such as Ho and Ag.26 We also determined the RT optical band gap of the thin PbI2 single crystal by fitting the optical transition at the absorption edges using the Tauc/David-Mott model.28 It has been reported that the Eg value of PbI2 would decrease with the increasing temperature at about 1.0 meV K−1 due to the structural lattice disorder.23 Therefore, the obtained Eg at RT is about 2.37 eV, which is smaller than those obtained at low temperatures.

To evaluate the photoelectric properties of the ultrathin PbI2 single crystals, a prototype photodetector with a lateral metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) configuration was fabricated (see Fig. 4a for the device layout). Before device fabrication, we have investigated the electric characteristics of PbI2 with different metal contacts. It can be derived that under our experimental conditions, Au contacts were non-Ohmic and can substantially reduce the dark current of the devices compared to Cu or Ag contacts (see details in the ESI†). Therefore, in this work, 200 nm thick Au was deposited on the thin single crystal through a Cu grid shadow mask to form two electrodes with a channel width of 1 mm and a spacing gap of 20 μm. The microscopy photograph of the fabricated PbI2 photodetector device is shown in Fig. 4b. Fig. 4c shows the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the photodetector measured in the dark and under air mass (AM 1.5) simulated solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2. It can be seen that with 5 V applied bias, the dark current is only 1.38 nA and the ON/OFF (photocurrent to dark current) ratio is about 5.19 × 102. The spectral responses of the photodetector with applied biases of 5 V, 10 V, and 15 V are shown in Fig. 4d. The responsivities are calculated by R = I/AE, where R is the responsivity, I is the photocurrent, A is the active area of the device, and E is the irradiance of the incident light. As expected, the responsivity exhibits a clear decrease at a wavelength around the absorption edge of PbI2. The spectral response range is similar to that of the photodetectors made of CdS due to their similar band gap,29 but the present device displays high response speed because of the high crystallinity of PbI2 single crystals.30 The peak responsivity of the photodetector at 15 V bias is about 11.3 A W−1 under irradiation of 440 nm light, which is higher than those of the M–S–M photodetectors made of other flexible materials.31,32 The photogain of the PbI2 photodetector can be further obtained by the expression R = ηgλ/1240, where η, g, and λ are the quantum efficiency, the photoconductive gain, and the incident light wavelength (nm), respectively. When we put 11.3 A W−1 for R and 440 nm for λ into the expression, the photogain can be estimated to be 31.84 by assuming η = 1 for simplicity. In addition, the photoresponsivity increases with the increasing applied bias voltage, indicating that an internal gain generated by the photoconductive gain mechanism exists in the device.33 However, high photoconductive gain is often correlated with plenty of trap states, which may lead to a slow decay of the photocurrent after switching off the light induced by the trap releasing current.34

(c) I–V characteristics of the photodetector measured in the dark and under AM 1.5 simulated solar illumination. (d) Spectral response of the photodetector measured at different bias voltages in the wavelength range of 200 to 980 nm. 
The time responses of the photodetector are shown in Fig. 5. The time constants for decay of the photocurrent are obtained by exponentially fitting the falling edges of the time response curves. At 15 V bias, the time constant is derived to be about 354 μs, which could be further shortened by improving the quality of the single crystals and reducing the spacing gap of the electrodes. Compared to photodetectors fabricated on other materials, such as thin films, nanowires and two dimensional (2D) nanomaterials,35–37 the time response of our photodetector fabricated on ultrathin single crystals is remarkably faster despite its high photogain. The detector presented here can offer a speed of operation of up to 1 kHz, which may sufficiently satisfy the requirement of a digital X-ray flat-panel detector.32

Conclusions
In summary, by taking advantage of the anisotropic nature of the atom bonding in layered materials, we have successfully grown ultrathin PbI2 single crystals in an aqueous solution environment, which exhibit good mechanical flexibility and bendability. These free-standing single crystals easily integrate with any flexible substrates. A prototype M–S–M photodetector demonstrates a high responsivity of up to 11.3 A W−1 and an excellent photogain (31.84) compared to those on other 2D nanostructures, such as single or few-layer MoS2 and GaSe.38 More importantly, the device shows a passable response speed (∼1 kHz) for common light or radiation detection and imaging. By further optimizing the growth conditions, it can be expected that large-scale ultrathin PbI2 single crystals can become promising candidates for developing flexible digital radiation detectors in medical or industrial imaging.
