    , Accepted 6th May 2021First published on 6th May 2021AbstractThe TiO2/MoS2 heterostructure consisting of varying concentrations of layered MoS2 on TiO2 of different morphology was fabricated successfully by a simple hydrothermal method. In this work, we employed TiO2 with different morphologies (commercial, nanotube, hierarchical, and nanosheets) for the synthesis of TiO2/MoS2 to examine the effect of morphology on hydrogen evolution trend. In particular, the photoinjected electron lifetime was greatly influenced by the structural pattern of the photocatalyst, as photoluminescence spectroscopy study revealed superior electron transfer efficiency in TiO2 nanosheets of the composite. The structure and optical properties of the as-prepared TiO2/MoS2 hybrid materials were confirmed by XRD, SEM, TEM, and PL studies. The hybrid materials indicated the heterostructure formation in the fine-tuned MoS2–TiO2 composite. The resultant TiO2/MoS2 showed good photocatalytic response than the pristine TiO2 and MoS2. Furthermore, at optimized MoS2 to TiO2 ratio in the composite, a series of photocatalysts were screened, such as TiO2 (commercial)/MoS2, TiO2 (nanotube)/MoS2, TiO2 (hierarchical)/MoS2 and TiO2 (nanosheets)/MoS2 with 2 wt% content of MoS2, and 29.71, 41.33, 65.54 and 77.41 μmol h−1 g−1 of hydrogen evolution was found, respectively. TiO2 (nanosheet)/MoS2 showed the highest rate of hydrogen evolution activity among them, and the introduction of MoS2 to TiO2 decreased the rate of charge carrier recombination and increased the hydrogen evolution activity. While promising, these approaches consisting of novelty that includes low cost, simple synthesis process, chemically robust and effective charge transfer pathways have shown to be effective for solar energy conversion to the clean fuel hydrogen production.
1. Introduction
Research on renewable energy has dominated over the last two decades to address the shortage of global energy requirements and environmental issues.1 Currently, the development of new technologies has been attempted in many areas such as solar energy systems and fuel cells. The harvesting of solar light and transformation into chemical energy, such as ethanol, methanol, and hydrogen, is supposed to be one of the most prominent approaches to solve the crisis of energy technology. H2 with its high calorific value, three times that of gasoline and four times that of natural gas, can be used to decrease carbon emission economy.2 Layered two-dimensional composites such as MoS2 and the most widely researched semiconductor TiO2 have become the topic of considerable research in solar hydrogen generation and environmental remediation. Although TiO2 is a suitable photocatalyst, there are some limitations with TiO2.3 The negative aspect is its large bandgap (3.2–3.3 eV), which means it is active only in the ultraviolet region, greatly limiting its practical applications. So, the development of a photo-catalyst with excellent catalytic activity under visible light is highly desirable.4 To avoid or resolve the abovementioned disadvantages, a variety of synthetic strategies have been considered. In respect of bandgap engineering, impurity doping,5 and the synthesis of heterostructures,6 dye sensitization, noble metal deposition, and formation of metal–organic frameworks are pivotal.
The broadband TiO2 nanoparticle light-harvesting window needs to be expanded towards the visible spectral range, which could be achieved by bandgap engineering and the large contact interface heterojunction of the materials. By coupling different semiconductors with TiO2, enhanced performance can be achieved as there is a decrease in charge carrier recombination.7 Nanosheet-like MoS2 is an outstanding photo-catalyst for both electrochemical and photochemical hydrogen evolution reaction8–11 and shows the potentially large application as a one of a kind semiconductor together with TiO2,12 CdS,13 ZnIn2S4,14 CdSe,15 and C3N4. MoS2 has attracted plenty of interest in hydrotreating catalysis,16 lithium-ion battery,17 electrocatalytic response,18 degradation of organic pollutants19–22 and optoelectronic gadgets,23,24 because of its low price owing to its earth-ample reserves and brilliant optical and electronic properties. The force of van der Waals interactions among these 2D structures frequently gives an upward push to the single or few-layered nanosheet (NS) pattern.25 The photochemically active MoS2 is a promising cocatalyst and alternative to the commonly used noble metals such as Pt and Au. Layered 2D MoS2 allows efficient charge transfers to reduce water in the process of photocatalytic H2 generation. Achieving high energy conversion is possibly due to the presence of unsaturated S atoms on the exposed edges of MoS2 that can act as active sites and show substantial proton affinity in the aqueous mixtures.26 It has been confirmed by computational and experimental studies that the unsaturated S atom located at the Mo (100) edge is the key factor in MoS2 for the aqueous proton reduction reaction.27,28 In addition to serving as an electron sink to decrease the rate of electron–hole recombination, the layered MoS2 also provides proton reduction sites and enhances the rate of hydrogen evolution reaction. Therefore, a nanosheet like MoS2 can be considered as a promising and efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen generation reaction because of its low cost, non-toxicity and efficient photo-stability. It has been found that interfacial charge transfer through the heterojunction of TiO2 and MoS2 increases the efficiency of the photocatalyst.29,30 The recent success in heterogeneous interfaces offers new opportunities to achieve excellent photocatalytic activities by tuning the structural morphology through shape-controlled synthesis of MoS2 and TiO2 nanoparticulates.
Herein, we address the cumulative factors that control the proton reduction path by the fabrication of MoS2 nanosheet-TiO2 with different morphologies of TiO2 (nano spheres, tubes, sheets and hierarchical TiO2) in a simple hydrothermal reaction process. Based on the detailed studies, we demonstrate that TiO2/MoS2 is an excellent catalyst for photocatalytic water splitting without using noble metals such as Pt co-catalyst. We quantify its potential by varying the surface of the prepared composites over the different morphological changes in TiO2. The two-dimensional compact contact of MoS2 with TiO2 enables the photogenerated electron to pass quickly from TiO2 to MoS2 and subsequently decrease the rate of charge carrier recombination, which is proved by photoluminescence (PL) spectra.
2. Experimentation
2.1 Synthesis of TiO2 Nanosheets (TNS)
The synthesis of ultra-thin anatase TiO2 nanosheets (sample 1) was carried out by a facile solvothermal method followed by base (NaOH) treatment.31 In a typical synthetic procedure, 10 mL of tetrabutyltitanate (TBOT) was injected into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. This was followed by the addition of 4 mL of hydrofluoric acid solution into the above liquid. Then, 10 mL of ethanol was dropped into the above solution with constant stirring. After stirring for 45 minutes the autoclave was locked and heated at 180 °C for 16 hours in an electric oven. Then, the product obtained was washed with absolute ethanol, 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution, and distilled water many times to remove residual contamination and fluorine absorbed, and dried at 80 °C for 12 hours.
2.2 Synthesis of hierarchical TiO2 (HPT)
Firstly, 0.6 g of titanium isopropoxide was added into concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) under strong magnetic stirring and then ethylene glycol was added to it. Secondly, 0.5 g cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was dissolved in 3 mL of distilled water to form an aqueous solution. Then, the aqueous CTAB solution was added to the first solution and stirred for 30 minutes to form an aqueous TTIP solution. After stirring, the solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 20 hours. After that, the autoclave was allowed to cool naturally.32 The obtained sample was washed with ethanol and distilled water several times and dried at 80 °C for 12 hours.
2.3 Synthesis of TiO2 nanotube (TNT)
For the synthesis of TiO2 nanotube, 1 g of TiO2 was added into 70 mL of 10 M NaOH and stirred vigorously for 2 hours to form a white suspension. After that, the suspension was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 12 hours to form sodium titanate nanotubes (STNTs). After being cooled to room temperature, the obtained STNT powder was washed with dilute HCl several times, then with distilled water until neutralization.33 Finally, the washed powder was dried in air at 60 °C, then calcined at 300 °C to increase the crystallinity of the TiO2 nanotube. Commercial TiO2, hierarchical TiO2, and TiO2 nanosheets were used without calculations for the synthesis of the composite.
2.4 Synthesis of TiO2/MoS2
For the synthesis of TiO2/MoS2 composite, different amounts of sodium molybdate and thioacetamide were dissolved in 70 mL of distilled water. Then, 300 mg of TiO2 (commercial, nanosheet, nanotube, and hierarchical) powder was added to the above solution and stirred for 2 hours to form a homogeneous suspension. After that, the suspension was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated in a hot air oven at 200 °C for 24 hours. The black product TiO2/MoS2 obtained was washed with deionised water and dried at 60 °C overnight. The composites of commercial TiO2, TiO2 nanotube, TiO2 nanosheet and hierarchical TiO2 were denoted as TiO2/MoS2, TNT/MoS2, TNS/MoS2 and HPT/MoS2, respectively. The schematic of the synthesis process is shown in ESI,† Scheme S1.
The ratio of Ti and Mo in all the samples (Table S3, ESI†) was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES). It was found that the ratio of Ti and Mo in all the samples was almost the same.
2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution test
The photocatalytic H2 generation experiment was carried out in a Pyrex flask at room temperature. A Newport Model-66921 400 W Xe arc lamp without any filter was used as the light source. In a typical experiment, 20 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 50 mL aqueous solution of 0.3 M Na2S/Na2SO3 by ultrasonication for 5 minutes. Before light irradiation, the suspension was evacuated followed by nitrogen purging for 40 minutes to remove any dissolved air and make an inert atmosphere. Then, the reaction solution was exposed to a light irradiation and the temperature was kept at 293 K throughout the reaction. The hydrogen was analyzed by using a gas chromatograph (PerkinElmer). The hydrogen production activity for all the samples was studied under the same condition. The apparent quantum efficiency of the H2 evolution system was measured by using 2 wt% MoS2/TiO2 as the photocatalyst.
The apparent quantum efficiency was calculated according to the following equation: (1) (2) (3)where ‘P’ is the input optical power, ‘λ’ is the wavelength of light, ‘h’ is the plank's constant, ‘c’ is the speed of light and ‘t’ is the irradiation time.
2.6 Photoelectrochemical studies
All the photoelectrochemical experiments were performed by using CHI instruments, with 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution with a three-electrode system. A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode, saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and photocatalyst-deposited flexible conductive polyethylene terephthalate (PET) thin film as the working electrode. The transient photocurrent experiments were carried out by periodic on/off of the light after every 30 seconds at constant 0 V potential. The corresponding photocurrent–time (I–t) curves were plotted. The working electrode was prepared by drop-casting of a viscous suspension of the photocatalyst on PET of 4 cm2 area. First, 10 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol and 20 μL of Nafion solution and ultrasonicated for 20 minutes. The viscous suspension was then deposited on the PET film by a drop-casting method. The film was dried at 65 °C for 1 hour in a hot air oven to evaporate the solvent. The amount of photocatalyst deposited on the film was optimized, which was found to be 1.5–2 mg in an area of 2 cm × 2 cm. The working electrode was irradiated under one sun simulator light while experimenting.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 PXRD studies

Fig. 1 exhibits the XRD pattern of TiO2, MoS2, and TiO2/MoS2 photocatalyst with TiO2 having different morphologies. The diffraction peaks of TiO2 (commercial)/MoS2, TNT/MoS2 and TNS/MoS2 composites appearing at 2θ = 25.3°, 37.6°, 47.8°, and 55.1° can be perfectly indexed to (101), (004), (200), and (211), respectively, which perfectly matches with the anatase phase of TiO2; in HPT/MoS2 the additional peak appearing at 27.42° indexed to the (110) plane shows that HPT is a mixture of the anatase and rutile phase of TiO2. For pure MoS2, the diffraction peak appearing at 2θ = 14.06°, 19.04°, 33.5°, 39.5° and 59.2° can be attributed to the (002), (004), (100), (103) and, (110) lattice planes of hexagonal phase MoS2 respectively.34,35 The diffraction peak at 14.3 corresponding to the MoS2 (002) plane in the patterns of TiO2/MoS2 is much weaker than that in the patterns of MoS2 nanoflowers, which might be because the low content and further anchored TiO2 nanostructures prevent the MoS2 nanosheets from restacking, substantially disrupting the flower-like nanostructure and forming the few-layer nanostructure that is too thin to be detected by XRD. The comparative data of the diffraction patterns of TiO2, MoS2 and TiO2/MoS2 are illustrated in the ESI† (Fig. S1).

3.2 UV–DRS studies
To measure the light absorbance and evaluation of the bandgap energy, ultra-violet diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was carried out. TiO2 showed a fundamental absorption band only in the UV region while the absorbance spectra of TiO2/MoS2 showed increased absorption in the visible region. Pure MoS2 exhibited broad absorbance in the visible region; this is due to the quantum confinement effect of the thin-layered MoS2, which makes the MoS2 an excellent catalyst for solar-driven photocatalysis reaction. Band broadening was not observed in the absorbance spectra of the TiO2/MoS2 composite, because the MoS2 loading on TiO2 was too low to be observed.36 To investigate the effect of MoS2 content on light absorbance, the absorbance spectra of the composites with increased loading of MoS2 were studied (Fig. S2, ESI†). The light absorbance of TNS/MoS2 increased in the visible region by increasing the MoS2 content. A bump of light absorption in the visible region similar to that in pure MoS2 was observed when the MoS2 content reached 8 wt%. The bandgap of the photocatalyst can be calculated using the following formula: (4)where ‘α’ is the absorption coefficient, ‘A’ is a constant, ‘h’ is the Plank's constant, ‘v’ is the frequency of incident light, ‘Eg’ is the bandgap energy and ‘n’ is equal to 1 for the direct transition. The corresponding Tauc plots showing the indirect bandgap of TiO2 and TiO2/MoS2 are shown in ESI† (Fig. S3). The calculated band gap energy for pure TiO2 was 3.32 eV, while a reduction in bandgap energy for TNS/MoS2, TiO2(C)/MoS2, TNT/MoS2, and HPT/MoS2, 3.07, 3.04, 2.98 and 2.52 eV, respectively, was observed, which is appropriate for UV–visible light absorption. It can be observed from Fig. 2 that light absorbance and bandgap energy change on varying the morphology of the TiO2 nanoparticles.29–37

3.3 FESEM studies
The morphology of the prepared TiO2/MoS2 samples was analyzed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Fig. 3(a) shows the sheet-like structure of TiO2 (nanosheet) which is around 100 nm wide, 20–50 nm thick and 200–250 nm in length. The synthesis of the composite disrupts the sheet-like morphology of TiO2 to some extent (Fig. 3(c)). In Fig. 3(e and f) we can see the tubular morphology of TiO2 which is decorated with MoS2. The morphology of MoS2 (Fig. 3(b)) can be described as a flower-like sphere that is assembled by a large number of petals; therefore, it is called nanoflowers. Fig. 3(i and j) shows the morphology of hierarchical TiO2/MoS2. TiO2 microspheres consisting of large number of nanorods and ranging from 20 to 60 nm in diameter and 500 nm in length can be clearly observed. MoS2 was not visible in the SEM image, and this was due to the small size of the layers and low content of MoS2. The morphology of the hierarchical microspheres of TiO2 decorated with MoS2 was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). As we can see from Fig. 3(i and j) the morphology of hierarchical TiO2/MoS2 can be described as a sphere of 2.5 μm diameter, which is assembled by a large number of nanorod structures and covered by MoS2 nanosheets.

3.4 TEM and HRTEM studies
To understand the interfacial contact, the TiO2/MoS2 nanocomposite was thoroughly investigated by TEM analysis. The TEM image of a single nanosheet clearly shows that the heterojunction is formed between commercial TiO2 (Fig. 4(a and e)), TiO2 nanosheet (Fig. 4(b and f)), TiO2 nanotube (Fig. 4(c and g)) and hierarchical TiO2 (Fig. 4(d and h)) and MoS2, with the interplanar spacing of TiO2 (0.347, 0.35, 0.325 and 0.32 nm) corresponding to interplanar spacing (110), (101), (110), and (110) and that of MoS2 (0.615, 0.62, 0.62 and 0.27 nm) to interplanar spacing (002), (002), (002) and (002), and the angles between the crystal planes of TiO2 and MoS2 are observed to be 40.781°, 49.115°, 45.927° and 45.223°, respectively.38 MoS2 and TiO2 cause the rapid transfer of electrons from TiO2 to MoS2 and enhance the activity of the catalyst. It should be noted that the heterojunction is clearly visible in the TEM image of TiO2/MoS2, indicating an ideal contact between them. The most significant feature of the heterojunction is that it favors the transfer of a photogenerated electron from TiO2 to MoS2. This is the key factor that determines the catalytic activity of the photocatalysts.39 The SAED of all the composites is given in ESI† (Fig. S4). The presence of all the constituent elements in TiO2/MoS2 was confirmed by EDAX analysis (Fig. S5, ESI†). Elemental mapping results revealed uniform elemental distribution in TNS/MoS2 (Fig. S6, ESI†).

3.5 PL studies
Light-harvesting by the interface between TiO2/MoS2 is the key factor that determines the activity of the photocatalyst. In this experiment, we used photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra to determine the electron transfer efficiency of electron transfer from TiO2 to MoS2.40Fig. 5 shows the PL spectra of TiO2/MoS2 excited at 430 nm. In the presence of MoS2, the intensity of the emission peak of TiO2 is quenched significantly at about 395 nm. This is due to the efficient transfer of an interfacial electron between MoS2 and TiO2. It can be said that MoS2 acts as an electron sink, which increases the activity by decreasing photogenerated charge carrier recombination.

3.6 TCSPC analysis
Charge transfer kinetics of photogenerated carriers was investigated by time-correlated single photon count (TCSPC). The photoluminescence decay of the sample was calculated by the following multi-exponential function: I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)(5)
The average lifetime was calculated by using following equation: (6)
As shown in the Fig. 6, the average life times of TiO2, TiO2/MoS2, TNT/MoS2, HPT/MoS2 and TNS/MoS2 are 0.059, 0.058, 0.057, 0.055, 0.0399 ns, respectively. The decrease in the average lifetime of the composites as compared to that of bare TiO2 indicates enhanced electron–hole separation, efficient charge transfer and higher photocatalytic activity. This result also supports the trend of the PL spectra. TNS/MoS2 shows a shorter lifetime compared to the other samples, thus, indicating the most efficient charge carrier separation.

3.7 BET analysis
The specific surface area of the photocatalyst was evaluated by BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) measurements.41Fig. 7 shows that the different morphologies of TiO2 have an effect on the specific surface area and the activity of the sample. The BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) specific surface area obtained for TNS/MoS2 was 83.253 m2 g−1 and hydrogen evolution rate was 77.41 μmol g−1 h−1, a value higher than the values of the other samples. Table 1 shows that the activity of the sample increases with increasing specific surface area.

3.8 XPS
To validate the chemical composition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was performed for 2 wt% MoS2/TiO2. The detection of carbon may be due to contamination on exposing the sample to air. Fig. 8(a) shows the binding energy of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 located at 456.98 and 462.70 eV, respectively. The binding energy values centered at 230.19 and 233.029 eV can be assigned to Mo 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively, obtained from the high-resolution spectrum of Fig. 8(b), indicating the formation of MoS2. In Fig. 8(c), a wide peak is observed, which can be deconvoluted into two main peaks of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 located at 167.19 and 160.24 eV, respectively.42 The asymmetric peak located at 530.2 and 528.17 eV can be assigned to the hydroxyl groups and the crystal lattice oxygen of Ti–O in TiO2, respectively, from the O1s XPS spectrum in Fig. 8(d). The complete XPS spectra of TiO2/MoS2 of all the samples are illustrated in ESI† (Fig. S7). The composites closely match with their respective binding energies. The uncertainty of the fitted data to actual data is given in Table S1 (ESI†).

3.9 Measurements of photocatalytic performance
The photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/MoS2 photocatalysts was evaluated by photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water splitting. A 400 W Xe-arc lamp was used as the light source. When the reaction was performed in dark condition or without catalyst no H2 was detected, which indicates that water splitting is a photo-catalyzed reaction. TiO2 showed a very low photocatalytic activity, which may be due to fast charge carrier recombination. It was observed that the pure form of MoS2 did not show activity towards photocatalytic water splitting, even though it showed strong absorption in the UV–visible region. It was found that the physical mixture of TiO2 and MoS2 did not show a significant increase in H2 evolution; this is due to poor interfacial contact between TiO2 and MoS2, which hinders charge separation. A significant increase in H2 evolution was observed when the TiO2/MoS2 composite was synthesised hydrothermally. In the TiO2/MoS2 composite, MoS2 is expected to harvest light and the TiO2/MoS2 heterojunction to facilitate electron–hole separation to increase the photocatalytic activity.3,43
In the present work, we synthesized TiO2/MoS2 in which different morphologies of TiO2 were used and the MoS2 content was varied. The TiO2/MoS2 composite showed the highest activity when the MoS2 content was 2 wt% and then the activity decreased gradually as the MoS2 content was increased. The 2 wt% content TiO2 (commercial)/MoS2, TiO2 (nanosheet)/MoS2, TiO2 (nanotube)/MoS2 and TiO2 (hierarchical)/MoS2 photocatalysts exhibited H2 evolution rates of 29.71, 77.41, 41.33 and 65.54 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. When MoS2 content exceeded more than 2 wt% the H2 evolution rate decreased gradually. This decreased activity was due to the excess of MoS2, which covered the active sites and hindered the photogenerated charge carriers.

Fig. 9(b–d) shows the hydrogen production activity of TiO2 (nanotube)/MoS2, TiO2 (nanosheet)/MoS2 and TiO2 (hierarchical)/MoS2, respectively. TiO2 (nanosheet)/MoS2 and TiO2 (hierarchical)/MoS2 show the highest activity (77.41 and 65.54 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively) at 2 wt% MoS2 content. The enhanced activity of TiO2 (nanosheet)/MoS2 than that of the other sample indicates the efficient interfacial charge transfer and increased specific surface area of TNS/MoS2. A comparison of the photocatalytic activity in the present work with previous results is presented in ESI† (Table S2).

A tentative mechanism is proposed for the charge transfer and enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the TiO2/MoS2 composite in Fig. 10. Electrons and holes remain in the valence band. When light falls on the photocatalyst, the valence band electrons of TiO2 are excited to the conduction band and electron–hole pairs are generated. Then, electrons from the conduction band are transferred immediately to MoS2 through the heterojunction between them. Without a co-catalyst, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs recombine quickly resulting in the low catalytic activity of TiO2. Only those electrons and holes which migrate to the surface of the catalysts without recombination take part in reduction and oxidation reactions. TiO2/MoS2 + hν → TiO2/MoS2(eCB− + hVB+)(7) SO32− + H2O + 2hVB+ → SO42− + 2H+(8) 2S2− + 2h+ → S22−(9) SO32− + S2 + 2hVB+ → S2O32−(10) SO32− + S22− → S2O32− + S2−(11) SO32− + H+ → HSO3− + S2−(12) TiO2/MoS2 + hν → TiO2(hVB+)/MoS2(eCB−)(13) TiO2(hVB+) + SO32− + S2− → TiO2 + S2O32−(14) MoS2(eCB−) + 2H+ → MoS2 + H2(15)

The reduction and oxidation reactions are the basic mechanisms of photocatalytic hydrogen production. As a result of the comparable difference in the conduction band energy, the photogenerated electrons are easily transferred from TiO2 to MoS2. Finally, the electrons on the MoS2 surface can reduce the absorbed protons to evolve H2, while the holes in the valence band of TiO2 are consumed by Na2S/Na2SO3 sacrificial reagent. For comparison, all the samples were prepared by a hydrothermal process in the same condition. The hydrogen evolution rates of TiO2 nanosheet and hierarchical TiO2 were higher than that of TiO2 (commercial) under the same reaction condition after loading 2 wt% of MoS2. The hydrogen evolution rates of TiO2 (commercial), TiO2 nanosheet, and hierarchical TiO2 increased to 29.71, 77.41 and 65.54 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. The hydrogen evolution activity of TiO2 nanosheet was about 2 times higher than that of TiO2 (commercial)/MoS2, which may be due to the higher activity of the high-energy (001) facets and greater contact interface between TiO2 nanosheet and MoS2. To evaluate the photocatalytic stability of 2 wt% MoS2/TiO2, cyclic H2 evolution experiment was performed three times lasting 9 hours. As shown in Fig. 11(a), no significant decrease in H2 evolution activity is observed. It confirms that the MoS2/TiO2 composite is a stable photocatalyst that has good stability in the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction.44

3.10 Photoelectrochemical studies
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out to observe the photoelectrochemical properties of the prepared samples. A comparative study was made between TiO2, TiO2/MoS2, and TNS/MoS2 to know the higher photo-response from the catalysts (Fig. 11(b)). TNS/MoS2 exhibited more cathodic current density under light irradiation. The high photocurrent density was achieved due to photon absorption and transfer through the interface to the reaction sites. The LSV results confirmed that the TNS/MoS2 composite is an efficient photocatalyst and photoelectrocatalytic material.45 The photocurrent–time (I–t) curves were plotted (Fig. 11(c)). The transient photocurrent experiment of TiO2/MoS2 and TNS/MoS2 was carried out for a better understanding of H2 evolution. It was observed that current density vividly improved under light illumination. The photocurrent is mainly produced by the separation and transport of electrons and holes to back contact across the photocatalyst and hole acceptor, respectively. It was observed that TNS/MoS2 showed enhanced photocurrent density than TiO2/MoS2, which supported the higher transfer and separation efficiency and increased photocatalytic hydrogen generation of TNS/MoS2.46 The fast charge transfer and higher separation efficiency of TNS/MoS2 was supported by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) analysis. The EIS Nyquist plot of TiO2/MoS2 and TNS/MoS2 are shown in Fig. 11(d). TNS/MoS2 has a small arc radius when compared with TiO2/MoS2 in the Nyquist plot indicating a rapid interfacial charge transfer in TNS/MoS2 than in TiO2/MoS2. All the photoelectrochemical studies complemented the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.47
The above results showed that the change in the morphology results in energy band matching between TiO2 and MoS2, leading to superior photocatalytic activity and eventually to enhanced hydrogen production.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a MoS2-decorated TiO2 nanocomposite was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. As a photocatalytic material for hydrogen evolution reaction, TiO2/MoS2 shows better activity than TiO2 and MoS2. Herein, we used different morphologies of TiO2 for the synthesis of TiO2/MoS2 to see the effect of different morphologies on the activity. The composite of TiO2 nanosheet with 2 wt% MoS2 showed the highest H2 production rate of 77.41 μmol h−1 g−1, which was considerably higher than that of the other composites. This may be due to the increased specific surface area of the TiO2 nanosheet and the transfer of a photogenerated electron from TiO2 to MoS2, which minimizes the electron and hole pair recombination to improve the efficiency of the composite for HER from aqueous solution. Through optimization, we found that TiO2/MoS2 showed the highest activity when the content of MoS2 was 2 wt%. The present work demonstrates the importance of TiO2 morphology and specific surface area in hydrogen evolution reactions.
