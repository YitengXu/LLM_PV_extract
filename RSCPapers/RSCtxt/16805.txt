    , Accepted 17th June 2013First published on 17th June 2013AbstractGroup 6 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) such as MoS2 are promising candidates for photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical applications. Despite their promise, scalable deposition of thin films remains a challenge for TMD-based photoanodes. Here we investigate the photoelectrochemical properties of ultra-thin films of chemically exfoliated MoS2 and its composites with TiO2 nanoparticles. We show that MoS2 monolayer films exhibit photoelectrochemical properties similar to bulk materials, generating photocurrent at excitation wavelengths above the direct band gap edge at ∼660 nm (∼1.9 eV). We also demonstrate that MoS2 monolayers adsorbed on TiO2 behave as effective photosensitizers. We find that in TiO2–MoS2 composite photoanodes, photoexcited hot electrons in MoS2 are able inject into TiO2 whilst holes are removed by the electrolyte so as to generate electrical current from incident light. Our results demonstrate the potential of solution-processed MoS2 monolayers for photoelectrochemical applications.
Introduction
Molybdenun disulphide (MoS2) is a semiconductor belonging to a class of compounds known as layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).1 Structurally, TMDs are composed of covalently bound X–M–X planes (where M and X represent transition metal and chalcogen atoms, respectively) held together by weak van der Waals (VDW) interactions, analogous to a graphite-type layered structure. The strong anisotropy of the structure readily enables the isolation of individual monolayers via cleavage along the weakly bound VDW planes.2 Atomically thin, mono- and few-layered sheets of MoS2 exhibit a range of intriguing properties that are absent in the bulk form and have sparked a recent resurgence of interest in TMDs. In particular, emergence of photoluminescence in monolayer MoS2 has attracted significant interest.3 The emergence of photoluminescence is attributed to the evolution of the bulk material from an indirect semiconductor (with a band gap of 1.29 eV) to a direct semiconductor (with a band gap of 1.90 eV) when reduced to a monolayer sheet.3 Mono- and few-layer MoS2 has also been highlighted as attractive candidates for nanoelectronics offering high carrier mobility, large on/off ratio, and minimal sub-threshold swing when implemented as the channel material in field effect transistors.4–6 Remarkable mechanical stability of atomically thin MoS2 sheets against bending,6 and stretching also emphasise distinct physical attributes of this material.7 These recent findings highlight the potential of MoS2 in various opto-electronic applications.8,9
Due to both its suitable band gap for solar spectrum absorption and its photocatalytic stability against photocorrosion,10,11 MoS2 and other group 6 TMDs have long been considered as ideal photoanode materials for photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical cells (PECs).11–13 Early work on PEC solar cells with MoS2 bulk single crystal photoanodes demonstrated energy conversion efficiency of up to 6%.14 In photocatalysis, MoS2 nanocrystals grown on wider gap semiconductor such as TiO2 serves as a sensitizer and enabling enhanced production of hydrogen15 and degradation of organic molecules.16–18 Similarly, WS2 (ref. 19) and WSe2 (ref. 20) particles have also shown to be effective photosensitizers to TiO2 surfaces in analogy to quantum dot sensitization.21
Despite the promising photocatalytic and PEC properties, scalability remains a common challenge for TMD-based photoanodes. Growth of bulk single crystals is slow, energetically costly and the crystal sizes are typically limited to a few centimeters. Whilst thin film deposition via sputtering and evaporation offer potential routes to scaling up, crystal quality is often compromised.14,22–24 Chemical synthesis of TMD nanoparticles is so far limited by lack of control of particle structure and scalability. In contrast, atomically thin sheets of TMDs offer solution based routes toward scalable production and deposition.25–27 Chemical exfoliation of bulk TMDs is an efficient route for producing monolayer TMDs in aqueous colloidal suspensions.28 Exfoliated sheets can be readily deposited uniformly over large areas26 or hybridized with other materials,29 enabling simple and scalable schemes for PEC device implementation.
While chemical exfoliation of MoS2 has been demonstrated since the 1960s,28 deposition of exfoliated sheets in uniform monolayered thin films form was only achieved recently.26 Here, we investigate the PEC properties of chemically exfoliated MoS2 mono- and few-layer thin films and their composites with TiO2 nanoparticles where the MoS2 nanosheets act as effective sensitizers.30 We demonstrate that chemically exfoliated monolayers of MoS2 largely preserve the photocatalytic properties of the bulk material and that they allow facile photosensitization of TiO2 nanoparticles via ligand-free direct adsorption. The photocurrent response of MoS2-sensitized TiO2 demonstrates the suitability of the orbital energy levels of exfoliated monolayer MoS2 for charge transfer to TiO2. Our analysis suggests that improvement in c-axis conductivity of restacked MoS2 sheets enhance the transport of photoexcited carriers. These results highlight monolayer MoS2 as a potentially exciting new class of semiconducting nanoparticles that can be readily implemented into PEC applications.
Experimental methods
Preparation of MoS2 thin films
MoS2 nanosheets and films were prepared by forced hydration exfoliation of LixMoS2 following the method described in ref. 26. The films with thicknesses spanning 1.7–18.9 nm were prepared on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass. The films were annealed in nitrogen atmosphere at 300 °C for 1 hour in order to stabilize the desired 2H phase (see ref. 26 for details). Film thickness was estimated from the UV-Visible absorbance spectra in reference to the empirical data of ref. 26. Thin film morphology and the atomic structure of the exfoliated sheets used in this study have been studied in detail and reported elsewhere.26,31
Preparation of MoS2–TiO2 films
MoS2–TiO2 composite films were prepared by dispersing Degussa P25 TiO2 into the aqueous solutions of 0.1 mg ml−1 MoS2 nanosheets. The solutions were sonicated for 40 min, stirred and then separated by centrifugation. The transparent supernatant was removed and the remaining off-white pellet was re-dispersed in ethanol as a paste. UV-Visible analysis of the transparent supernatant confirmed the transfer of MoS2 to the solid paste. The resultant paste was left to stir for >12 hours. Films were prepared by a doctor blade technique.
Three batches of films were prepared. Each batch contained a different ratio of MoS2–TiO2. Batch A and B contained 0.4 mg MoS2, however, A contained double the quantity of TiO2 (0.5 g) relative to B (0.25 g). A TiO2 only reference film was also prepared by the same method. Each paste was prepared with a quantity of ethanol proportionate to the quantity of TiO2. Each film was prepared using the same volume of paste (20 μl) on FTO conductive glass using the doctor blade technique. The films were annealed for 30 min under a flow of argon at 300 °C. The thickness of prepared films (determined by SEM) was approximately 10 μm.
Photocurrent measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were recorded at room temperature in an in-house designed three-electrode cell fitted with fused silica windows. A 75 W xenon lamp and PTi LPS-220B power supply in conjunction with a PTi SID-101 monochromator and a PTi optical chopper were used to illuminate the samples. A computer controlled μAutolabI potentiostat coupled with a lock-in amplifier were used to measure photocurrent. All measurements were recorded against a Ag/AgCl/1 M KCl reference electrode with a platinum mesh counter electrode. 1 M Na2SO3 was used as a hole scavenger. All photoanodes were illuminated from the MoS2–TiO2 side. The lamp intensity was monitored with a PM100A, Thorlabs power meter.
Results and discussion
The absorption spectra of the MoS2 thin films (Fig. 1a) exhibit the characteristic optical peaks of bulk MoS2. These peaks in the visible region (400–800 nm) correspond to the optical transitions between d-orbitals (Fig. 1b) that non-bonding states of MoS2.32 The energy band structure of MoS2 and the optical transitions associated with the absorption peaks are illustrated in Fig. 1b.33,34 The A/B peaks correspond to the band edge excitons at the K and K′ points of the Brillouin zone35 while the C/D transitions are interband transitions from the occupied dz2 orbital to unoccupied dxy, x2 − y2 and dxz, yz orbitals. The measured A/B excitonic peaks (Fig. 1a) show a slight blue shift by approximately 14 nm as film thickness decreases from 18.9 nm to 1.7 nm (prominent in normalized spectra, ESI, Fig. S2†) due to confinement effects.26 The A exciton peak for the 1.7 nm thickness film is located at 655 nm, consistent with the previously reported peak position for mechanically exfoliated MoS2 monolayers.3

Photocurrent measurements were conducted on thin MoS2 films with thicknesses ranging from 1.7 to 18.9 nm. The photocurrent density (IS) and incident lamp power (P) were measured as a function of wavelength (λ). Photocurrent is typically characterized by incident-photon-to-current-efficiency (IPCE), (1)where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light and e is the elemental charge.
We employed absorbed photon-to-current efficiencies (APCE) to characterize the quantum yield photocurrent efficiencies of our samples and to compare samples of different thicknesses. APCE (eqn (2)) is calculated by dividing IPCE by light harvesting efficiency of the sample; APCE = IPCE/(1 − T(%))(2)where T(%) is the transmittance and thus the denominator is the fraction of incident photons absorbed by the sample. Here is it assumed that reflectance is negligible compared to absorbance. APCE spectra for the films prepared with different film thickness are presented in Fig. 2a.
 Fig. 2  (a) Averaged (3 data for each film thickness) APCE spectra of the n-type MoS2 films of different film thickness (solid lines with symbols) conducted at 0 V potential against Ag/AgCl/1 M KCl reference electrode. The spectra are overlaid with the normalized UV-vis absorbance of a thin (1.7 nm) MoS2 thin film (solid black line). It is of note that relatively large APCE signals recorded for λ > 680 nm is due to accentuated noise (the monolayer has extremely low absorbance across this region, see ESI, Fig. S1† for IPCE data). (b) Wavelength specific APCE values plotted with respect to film thickness. (c) The average IPCE photocurrent response plotted against potential (vs. SHE reference electrode) of a 4 nm MoS2 film on FTO substrate. Between every second and third potential photocurrent measurement, the IPCE was re-measured at 0 V to confirm that the sample had not degraded from the photocatalytic efficiency. (d) The possible mechanistic routes for the decay of excited electrons. k1 and k2 are the possible routes of injection of the electron into the FTO. k3 corresponds to thermalization of excited electrons in the upper orbital energy to conduction band minimum and k4 represents recombination loss mechanisms. 
For all samples positive photocurrent signal was recorded, and hence the material is an n-type semiconductor. For samples thinner than 5 nm, photocurrent signal were observed for wavelengths less than 700 nm. The monolayer film revealed the highest APCE values. For most samples, the photocurrent spectra consisted of features near 590–670 nm, corresponding to the A/B optical transitions. However, clear features corresponding to C/D absorption peaks at 400–480 nm were absent. Similar behaviour has been previously reported for bulk single crystals of MoSe2 and WSe2.22 Nevertheless, the APCE values show little fluctuations across the spectrum above the direct band edge (∼650 nm) indicating that the efficiency of photoexcited electrons injection into FTO is not strongly dependent on the excited states of MoS2. With regards to stability, it is of note that samples stored in the dark between measurements were stable with respect to photocurrent efficiency over the 12 month period that data were collected.
An increase in film thickness from 1.7 nm to 10 nm leads to an increase in the light harvesting efficiency (1 − T(%)) of MoS2 films by 600% (Fig. 1a). The corresponding APCE values decreased by 50–70 times. The decrease in APCE is dramatic with photocurrent response, plummeting with film thickness of around ∼2 nm, or when the film becomes multi-layered (Fig. 2b). At 10 nm, the photocurrent signal is reduced to experimental noise level. We propose that the decrease in efficiency is due to a combination of factors. Firstly, the out-of-plane charge mobility is considerably lower than the in-plane mobility as a consequence of the layered structure of MoS2. For monolayer MoS2 where the transport distance and therefore time for electrons to reach the FTO interface is minimized, the photocurrent efficiency is highest. On the other hand, for samples of thickness greater than a monolayer, the transit time for electrons–holes to reach FTO–electrolyte interface is significantly increased and the exciton recombination can take place before electrons and holes are separated. Since the MoS2 sheets are randomly stacked, the inter-plane charge transport is limited compared to commensurately stacked single crystals. Hence, as the thickness of absorbing material increases, kinetics tends to favour exciton recombination rather than separation leading to a decrease in the APCE.
Another possible explanation is the evolution of MoS2 band structure with thickness. Bulk MoS2 is an indirect semiconductor and thus a defining indirect transition exists at energies lower than the direct band gap transition corresponding to A/B excitons. This may therefore be a competing relaxation mechanism for an exciton relative to injection into FTO. As the film becomes thicker, A/B excitons have additional pathway for relaxation to lower energy and recombination, thus reducing the probability of electron injection to FTO electrode.
In order to investigate the energetics of the materials interface, the influence of potential difference on the photocurrent response was monitored. When a potential difference of an appropriate range is applied across the cell the flatband position of MoS2 films can be approximated as the potential at which the photocurrent response of the material is suppressed, coincident with the irreversible reduction of MoS2 and hence injection of electrons into the conduction band of MoS2. As shown in Fig. 2c, we observed that photocurrent associated with A/B and C/D excitations is dependent on the potential applied across the cell (Fig. 2c). These results suggest that electrons excited to the conduction band can thermalize to form band edge A/B excitons from where they are also able to contribute to photocurrent (transfer into the FTO). The photocurrent signal corresponding to A/B transitions was not observed at potentials lower than −0.13 ± 0.05 V (vs. SHE electrode). It is also of note that if the potentials applied was lower than this value, upon re-increasing the potential applied the photocurrent response was not reproducible. Thus we propose the irreversible reduction of the film (injection of electron into the conduction band of the MoS2 from the FTO) at potentials of this value and lower. Hence we approximate this potential as the flat band potential of the A/B exciton conduction band. We detail the possible mechanistic routes for electron–hole pairs associated with C/D peaks in Fig. 2d. k1 and k2 transitions correspond to injection of electrons into FTO and hence these routes contribute to photocurrent whereas k3 and k4 transitions correspond to thermalization and recombination processes. The fact that IPCE from C/D transitions changes with the applied potential indicates that electron thermalization to direct band edge (k3) is favourable compared to direct transfer into FTO (k2).
Our photocurrent spectra highlight that chemically exfoliated MoS2 monolayers retain bulk PEC properties and demonstrate that these materials are potentially useful as photoactive components in PEC solar cells. However, to achieve higher photon-to-current conversion efficiencies, alternative photoanode architectures should be explored whereby the surface area of the MoS2 monolayers is increased per unit area of illumination to overcome the small absorption cross-section of the atomically thin sheets and also encourage exciton separation. In the remainder of this paper, we discuss the PEC properties of MoS2–TiO2 hybrid photoelectrodes. The structure of the electrodes is analogous to the photoanodes used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC)30 where the exfoliated MoS2 can be seen as a sensitizer to the mesoporous TiO2. In such devices, photoexcited electrons in MoS2 are expected to first inject into and subsequently diffuse through the TiO2 to the FTO substrate while the holes in MoS2 are removed by the electrolyte solution that penetrates into the mesoporous structure. The holes are transferred via electrolyte diffusion towards the counter electrode where electrons re-enter the cell, thus completing the circuit. For electron injection into TiO2 to occur, it is required that the conduction band minimum of MoS2 lie above that of TiO2. In previous studies,36,37 such band alignment was achieved with MoS2 nanoparticles where, as a consequence of quantum confinement, the band gap is significantly increased and the conduction minimum is pushed up (relative to that of the bulk material). Earlier studies on both nano-crystalline and few-layered MoS2 and WS2 have suggested that electron injection is indeed possible for the MoS2–TiO2 systems.19,38 Below we reveal a different scenario with monolayers of MoS2 where we demonstrate that lowest energy excitons are less likely to contribute to photocurrent.
The composite films were prepared by the mixing of TiO2 nanoparticles and a prepared colloidal suspension of chemically exfoliated MoS2 monolayers (Fig. 3a). The mesoporous structure of the composites is shown in Fig. 3b. A typical transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of the composite is shown in Fig. 3c where MoS2 sheets can be observed randomly dispersed within the sample. The lattice spacing of 0.3 nm correspond to the lattice plane spacing of anatase TiO2 (101). The parallel fringes separated by 0.6 nm, which agrees with the interlayer spacing of MoS2, shows that the MoS2 sheets are locally restacked. The composite films were also characterized by Raman spectroscopy to confirm the presence of MoS2. The Raman spectra of MoS2–TiO2 composite films overlaid with spectra of TiO2-only films are shown in Fig. 3. Differences between the two spectra reveal two distinct vibrational modes of MoS2 (E12g and A1g) indicating that the exfoliated MoS2 remain intact during the preparation of the composite.

The arrows in (c) indicate the distinct fringes suggesting the presence of MoS2 sheets. (d) Raman spectra of MoS2–TiO2 with TiO2 overlaid and the difference between the two spectra. Two vibrational modes of MoS2 (E12g and A1g) are evident in the difference spectrum. 
The photocurrent responses of TiO2–MoS2 composite photoanodes are shown in Fig. 4. Three sets of films were prepared, two containing MoS2 monolayer sheets, and a control sample containing TiO2 only. The successful sensitization of TiO2 with MoS2 is indicated by the extension of the photocurrent response into the visible region of the spectrum relative to the TiO2 only film. An increase of 500% for film IPCE was achieved for the sensitized film relative to the 1.7 nm MoS2 only (Fig. S1†) film on FTO, indicating successful utilization of high surface area in mesoporous TiO2 structure. It is also noteworthy that the estimated APCE values (Fig. S3†) are of the same order of magnitude to monolayer MoS2 values. Conversely to thin MoS2 films where excitations above the direct band edge lead to generation of photocurrent (Fig. 2), photocurrent is suppressed at wavelengths above 600 nm for the composite films. Estimated APCE is also found to vanish above 600 nm (not shown).
 Fig. 4  (a) Averaged IPCE (3 data sets) photocurrent spectra (solid lines) of TiO2–MoS2 composite (red and blue) and TiO2 only films (green). The spectra are overlaid with the normalized absorbance of 1.7 nm MoS2. (b) Schematics of the band structure of MoS2 and TiO2 at the interface. Measured flat band potential of MoS2 (−0.13 eV vs. SHE) and estimated flat band potential of TiO2 (−0.8 eV vs. SHE) are shown along with the band gap of the two materials. Electron injection into TiO2 conduction band from band edge excitons (A/B transitions) is energetically unfavourable. On the other hand, electrons excited into the upper d-orbitals of MoS2via C/D transitions can inject into TiO2 conduction band. 
Despite the successful sensitization of TiO2, we observe relatively low IPCE values. The enhancement in IPCE is minor when MoS2 loading is doubled. We speculate that a sizeable fraction of the TiO2/electrolyte interface remains unsensitized because the MoS2 nanosheets do not uniformly coat the entire TiO2 surface and that some of the MoS2 sheets may also be positioned at the interface of TiO2 particles, inhibiting electron transport. In addition to the MoS2 crystal distribution, the crystal size and resultant constraints on charge carriers must also be considered. A carrier lifetime of 100 ps ± 10 ps and a corresponding diffusion length of 450 nm have recently been measured for ultrathin MoS2 layers.39 Given that an exciton that reaches a crystal edge will recombine due to crystal defects, the crystal sizes utilized in this work (less than 300–800 nm diameter) may limit the photocurrent efficiencies of our devices. The likelihood of an exciton reaching the TiO2 interface (rather than the crystal edge) is increased for larger sized monolayer crystals. We therefore highlight sensitization with larger crystals as a possible route to higher photocurrent efficiencies.
The photocurrent spectra for TiO2–MoS2 composite can be explained by the energy band alignment of MoS2 and TiO2. The flat band potential of TiO2 corresponds to the minimum energy required for a photoexcited electron in MoS2 to inject into TiO2 conduction band. The flat band position of mesoporous TiO2 has been shown to be strongly dependent on the pH of the penetrating electrolyte solution.40 We can estimate the flat band potential of our TiO2 to be at approximately −0.80 V (vs. SHE). The relevant band positions/gaps of MoS2 and TiO2 are shown on a comparable scale in Fig. 4b, which reveals that A/B excitons in the lower conduction band of MoS2 are of insufficient energy to inject into the TiO2 conduction band. The position of the C/D flat band potential is estimated above the conduction band of TiO2 and thus excited electrons have sufficient energy to inject into TiO2.41 It is of note that the observation of photocurrent from C/D absorption bands suggest more favourable kinetics of electron transfer (k2) from MoS2 to TiO2, in contrast to MoS2 thin film injection into FTO. Furthermore, our data infers differing mechanisms of electron injection for the different substrates (FTO and TiO2). With reference to Fig. 2d, we thus infer k2 < k3 for a MoS2–FTO film. In contrast, for the TiO2–MoS2 system, we see photocurrent from k2 only. That is, electrons in the conduction band minima are not able to inject into the TiO2, whereas hot electrons, above the conduction band minima are able to inject. Based on our observations, we postulate hot injection kinetics, whereby electron transfer is kinetically favoured over electron thermalization.
Conclusions
We studied the PEC properties of chemically exfoliated MoS2. MoS2 thin films on FTO and TiO2–MoS2 composites on FTO show that photoexcited electrons in MoS2 can be transferred to the electrode while the holes are removed by the electrolyte, leading to generation of photocurrent. Photocurrent dependence on MoS2 film thickness reveals an acute drop in efficiency with increasing film thickness such that monolayer MoS2 films produce the highest photocurrent. We speculate that low charge carrier mobility in layered structures and in particular in the re-stacked structure (in contrast to single crystals) of the exfoliated films prevent efficient transport of charges to transfer interfaces.
We have successfully translated the aqueous solution-processability of exfoliated MoS2 and its PEC stability to sensitization of the mesoporous TiO2. We have demonstrated that simple direct adsorption of MoS2 sheets onto TiO2 surfaces leads to effective sensitization and enhanced photocurrent efficiencies of the photoanode due to enhanced absorption per unit volume. Contrary to the photocurrent spectra of MoS2 films on FTO, only the C/D absorption contributes to the photocurrent in the composite films. We have also shown that the conduction band minimum of MoS2 lies below that of TiO2 such that electron injection from A/B excitons is suppressed.
Appropriate band gap energies and photostability in combination with solution-processability of MoS2 monolayers highlight the material as a promising candidate for PEC applications. In particular we demonstrate that a new type of semiconductor-sensitized PEC solar cells can be fabricated with MoS2 monolayers. We believe that optimization of the photoanode architecture, utilization of larger monolayer crystals and use of other types of transition metal dichalcogenides such as WSe2 could significantly enhance photocurrent efficiencies.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) UV-vis absorbance of the MoS2 thin films deposited on FTO conductive glass and annealed in a nitrogen environment at 300 °C. The average film thicknesses were calculated from the empirical data of ref. 26. Inset shows a photo of a MoS2 thin film deposited on a glass substrate. (b) Simplified orbital energy structure of MoS2 adapted from ref. 32. The transitions labelled A, B, C and D correspond to the transitions labelled in (a).	 
	(1)
APCE = IPCE/(1 − T(%))	(2)

 	Fig. 2  (a) Averaged (3 data for each film thickness) APCE spectra of the n-type MoS2 films of different film thickness (solid lines with symbols) conducted at 0 V potential against Ag/AgCl/1 M KCl reference electrode. The spectra are overlaid with the normalized UV-vis absorbance of a thin (1.7 nm) MoS2 thin film (solid black line). It is of note that relatively large APCE signals recorded for λ > 680 nm is due to accentuated noise (the monolayer has extremely low absorbance across this region, see ESI, Fig. S1† for IPCE data). (b) Wavelength specific APCE values plotted with respect to film thickness. (c) The average IPCE photocurrent response plotted against potential (vs. SHE reference electrode) of a 4 nm MoS2 film on FTO substrate. Between every second and third potential photocurrent measurement, the IPCE was re-measured at 0 V to confirm that the sample had not degraded from the photocatalytic efficiency. (d) The possible mechanistic routes for the decay of excited electrons. k1 and k2 are the possible routes of injection of the electron into the FTO. k3 corresponds to thermalization of excited electrons in the upper orbital energy to conduction band minimum and k4 represents recombination loss mechanisms.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Schematic illustration of the fabrication of a TiO2–MoS2 composite film. (b) SEM and (c) TEM images of the composite. The arrows in (c) indicate the distinct fringes suggesting the presence of MoS2 sheets. (d) Raman spectra of MoS2–TiO2 with TiO2 overlaid and the difference between the two spectra. Two vibrational modes of MoS2 (E12g and A1g) are evident in the difference spectrum.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Averaged IPCE (3 data sets) photocurrent spectra (solid lines) of TiO2–MoS2 composite (red and blue) and TiO2 only films (green). The spectra are overlaid with the normalized absorbance of 1.7 nm MoS2. (b) Schematics of the band structure of MoS2 and TiO2 at the interface. Measured flat band potential of MoS2 (−0.13 eV vs. SHE) and estimated flat band potential of TiO2 (−0.8 eV vs. SHE) are shown along with the band gap of the two materials. Electron injection into TiO2 conduction band from band edge excitons (A/B transitions) is energetically unfavourable. On the other hand, electrons excited into the upper d-orbitals of MoS2via C/D transitions can inject into TiO2 conduction band.
