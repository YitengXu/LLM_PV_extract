    , Accepted 3rd December 2015First published on 7th December 2015AbstractTailoring the morphology of mesoporous nanostructures toward performance enhancement plays a key role in developing efficient energy storage devices. Herein, we report the formation of well crystallized Mn2O3 mesoporous nanobars through simple exo-templating of a manganese 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate metal–organic framework (Mn-BTC MOF) by thermal treatment whereby the general morphology of the parent MOF is conserved, but with more voids and spaces. The parent Mn-BTC MOF was synthesized by solvothermal reaction of trimesic acid with manganese nitrate in alcoholic solution. The MOF-derived Mn2O3 was characterized by XRD, field-emission SEM, high-resolution TEM, and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm measurements. When examined as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries in the potential windows of 0.01–3.0 V and 0.01–2.0 V, high reversible specific capacities of 849 and 778 mAh g−1 were obtained. It was found that the electrochemical processes are more reversible when cycled in the 2 V window. A steady capacity of ∼410 mAh g−1 was observed after 300 continuous cycles at ∼C/5.5 exhibiting good cycling stability in the 2 V window. When tested as a pseudocapacitor electrode in a three-electrode configuration, a specific capacitance of 250 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 could be achieved. Further, to demonstrate practical applicability, two-electrode asymmetric supercapacitor pouch cells were assembled with Mn2O3 as the positive electrode and commercial activated carbon as the negative electrode which showed an ultrahigh energy density of 147.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1004 W kg−1. The present work shows the potential of a MOF derived route for obtaining metal oxides with desired nano-architectures for electrochemical applications with high performance.
Introduction
In recent years, nanostructured metal oxides, especially transition metal oxides (TMOs) have emerged as the most promising electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage.1–6 In particular, considerable efforts have been directed to develop TMOs as: (i) anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity originating from a novel conversion mechanism as demonstrated by Tarascon et al.1 and (ii) pseudocapacitive electrodes in supercapacitors due to their ability to yield much higher energy densities (20–50 W h kg−1) than conventional carbon based materials (10–20 W h kg–1).7,8
In order to exploit the full potential of transition metal oxides, the synthesis of porous nanostructures with controlled nano-architectures and surface morphologies is extremely important for achieving the desired application specific physico-chemical properties.9,10 The ultimate electrochemical performance is strongly influenced by a combination of several parameters such as crystallinity, effective surface area, interconnected pores with controlled size and distribution, surface energy, chemical reactivity etc. Also, electrode fabrication engineering such as using strain-released hybrid multilayer anodes has led to significant enhancement in the field of LIBs.11–13 During the last decade, considerable work has been focused on synthesizing various forms of nanostructured porous transition metal oxides.14 However, these efforts are mostly concentrated on wet chemical routes and despite the advancements made, challenges still remain with respect to tailoring the morphology in an easily scalable controlled way with a high degree of reproducibility. In this respect, metal organic frameworks (MOF), which are porous coordination polymers, offer the possibility of creating designer nanostructures by varying the nodal metal ions and the multi-nodal organic linkers.15,16 MOFs can be easily converted into metal oxides by calcination creating a large number of voids and spaces. A high surface area and a suitable pore size would allow the maximum amount of active sites to be exposed to the electrolyte, the condition most favorable for lithium-ion battery or supercapacitor applications. Recognizing this opportunity, the field of MOF derived metal oxides has been growing at a fast pace in recent years and several excellent reviews are available.17–19 In this work, we synthesized Mn2O3 porous nanostructures through calcination of a Mn-BTC MOF and investigated its electrochemical properties as both LIB and supercapacitor electrodes. Though Mn2O3 possesses a relatively lower electronic conductivity compared to other forms of manganese oxide, the rationale behind the selection of Mn2O3 was its high theoretical capacity of 1018 mA h g−1 as a LIB anode (between 0–3 V) due to two redox processes occurring at ∼1.3 V (Mn0 ↔ Mn2+) and ∼2.2 V (Mn2+ ↔ Mn3+).20 As most of the reversible capacity of Mn2O3 is generated by the first process (i.e., conversion reaction involving Mn and Li2O), this provides us with an opportunity to develop an anode with a relatively lower operating voltage vs. Li/Li+ (<2 V). Additionally, Mn2O3 also has a high theoretical capacitance of 611 F g−1 as an electrochemical pseudocapacitor.
There are several reports on Mn2O3 porous structures synthesized by wet chemical routes,21–33 where improved electrochemical performance with high capacity, good cycling stability, and rate capability could be obtained though in some cases the capacity retention upon cycling is poor.34,35 Qiu et al.36 hydrothermally synthesized oval-shaped hierarchical structures and achieved a specific capacity of ∼380 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles for straw-sheaf shaped Mn2O3. On the other hand, hollow rod-like Mn2O3, synthesized from bacterial templates showed a specific capacity of ∼300 mA h g−1.37 Deng et al.24 reported a maximum specific capacity of 796 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1, whereas, Dai et al.25 showed a specific capacitance of ∼900 mA h g−1 at a relatively low current density of 50 mA g−1 in the same potential window. Pal et al.38 observed that among different shapes, hollow spheres can yield a better capacity (478 mA h g−1) with 38% retention after 30 cycles due their highly accessible surface area and inner hollow architecture. Similarly, Li et al.39 showed that Cu-doped hollow spherical Mn2O3 exhibited a specific capacity of 642 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1. However, Lin et al.27 reported a capacity of ∼750 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 using triple-shelled Mn2O3 hollow nanocubes. A very high capacity (1442 mA h g−1 at 800 mA g−1), exceeding the theoretical capacity, has recently been reported by Liu et al.33 Very recently, Mn2O3 nanocrystallites with a porous structure obtained from calcination of [Mn(Br4-bdc)(4-4′-bpy)(H2O)2]n (Br4-bdc = tetrabromo terephthalate and 4-4′-bpy = 4-4′-bipyridine) has shown an exceptionally high rate capability (705 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1) studied in the potential window extended to 3.0 V.32 These excellent studies highlight the importance of developing designer porous structures for enhancement of electrochemical performance. By changing the organic linkers, different manganese based MOFs can be obtained which produce Mn2O3 in different morphologies.
In all the studies so far, the potential window was extended (up to 3.0 V) to accommodate the contribution from the additional redox process, Mn2+ ↔ Mn3+, generating extra capacity. From the viewpoint of practical suitability, a potential window up to 2.0 V (utilizing only the Mn0 ↔ Mn2+ redox process) would be more appropriate for an anode.
Mn2O3 is also being considered as a promising pseudocapacitor electrode due its pronounced electrochemical redox activity via the Mn3+ to Mn4+ transition giving rise to a theoretical capacity of 611 F g−1 (one electron transfer process). Accordingly, several studies have been devoted to developing Mn2O3 or Mn2O3 based composites as pseudocapacitors in three-electrode cells,40–47 or in two-electrode symmetric/asymmetric cells.41,45,47 Nathan et al.40 found a pseudocapacitance of 100 F g−1 from spherical nanoparticles of cubic Mn2O3 in 6 M KOH. Chen et al.42 observed a specific capacitance value of 202 F g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 for α-Mn2O3 having different morphologies including spheres and polyhedrons. On the other hand, Li et al.47 demonstrated specific capacitance values of 191 F g−1 and 53 F g−1 in 0.5 M Na2SO4 respectively in three and two electrode configurations using porous Mn2O3 nano-cubes. A specific capacitance of 306 F g−1 has also been achieved by using Mn2O3 nanorod structures produced by the pulse reverse potential method.43
In order to improve the capacitance further, carbon based Mn2O3 composites have also been investigated. In a neutral electrolyte, Park46 reported a pseudocapacitance value of 300 F g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 in 1.0 M Na2SO4 using carboxylated-graphene–Mn2O3 as the working electrode. On the other hand, Zhang et al.44 observed a pseudocapacitance value of 370 F g−1 at 100 mA g−1 in 1.0 M Na2SO4 in a three electrode configuration from 3D graphene/CNTs/Mn2O3. In an alkaline electrolyte (1 M NaOH), a pseudocapacitance of 425 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 was obtained from rGO/Mn2O3/Mn3O4 in a three electrode configuration and an asymmetric supercapacitance of 133 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 was obtained from rGO/Mn2O3/Mn3O4//graphene in a two electrode configuration.45 From the above literature survey, it can be seen that the specific capacitance of Mn2O3 nanostructures, synthesized by wet chemical routes, lies in the range 100–300 F g−1 in the pristine form and in the range 300–425 F g−1 in the composite form. So far, the pseudocapacitive property of Mn2O3, derived through a MOF route has not been investigated.
Herein, we report the synthesis of nanostructured Mn2O3 with a controlled porous structure by a MOF exo-templating method where the morphology of the parent Mn-BTC MOF (BTC = 1,3,5-benzene-tricarboxylate) is retained but with a large proportion of voids and spaces. The electrochemical properties as a 2 V LIB anode and as pseudocapacitor in three and two electrode configurations have been evaluated without forming any composite to investigate the effect of the morphological features in isolation.
Experimental
Synthesis
The following chemicals were used for the synthesis of Mn-BTC and Mn2O3 thereof: manganese nitrate Mn(NO3)2·4H20 (98+%, Acros Organics, USA), trimesic acid (H3BTC) (∼95%, Merck, Germany) and ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH) (Merck, Germany).
The Mn-BTC metal–organic framework was synthesized by following a simple solvothermal process similar to the one described in our previous work.48 Briefly, two separate alcoholic solutions were prepared by dissolving (i) 7.5 mmol of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O in 50 ml of C2H5OH (solution-A) and (ii) 4.16 mmol of trimesic acid (H3BTC) in 30 ml of C2H5OH (solution-B). Solution-B was added slowly to solution-A under constant stirring until a clear solution was obtained. The mixture was transferred to an autoclave and the reaction was allowed to continue for 4 days at 160 °C under autogenously developed pressure. A light brown powder, thus obtained, was collected by centrifugation. After repeated washing by ethanol, the synthesized Mn-BTC powder was dried at 60 °C for 12 h in an air oven.
Mn2O3 was synthesized via calcination of the Mn-BTC MOF at 650 °C for 3 h. The temperature of the furnace was raised at a rate of 2 °C per min. The resulting powder was dark brown in colour. A schematic representation of the synthesis mechanism of Mn-BTC and Mn2O3 thereof is given in Scheme 1.

Activated carbon powder (carbon content >95%, ash content <0.07%), purchased from MTI Corporation, USA, was used for fabricating the negative electrode for the asymmetric supercapacitor.
Material characterization
Phase purity and crystallinity were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), recorded in the 2θ range 20–80° at a scanning rate of 2° min−1 by an X-ray diffractometer (Philips X'Pert, the Netherlands) with Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The morphology and microstructural features were inspected by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) using a ZEISS Supra 35 (Germany) . A Tecnai G2 30ST (FEI) transmission electron microscope, operating at 300 kV, was used to obtain the high resolution transmission electron microscopy images (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in air at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using a Simultaneous Thermal Analyser (STA449F, Netzsch, Germany). Nitrogen gas adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out at 77.3 K using a Quantachrome (USA) Autosorb surface analyzer.
Electrochemical characterization
The electrochemical properties as LIB anode were evaluated in 2032 type coin cells vs. Li/Li+. First, a slurry was made by thoroughly mixing Mn2O3, Super-P carbon (conducting agent) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, binder) in a weight ratio of 70:20:10 in n-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP, solvent). Then, the slurry was coated onto copper foil of thickness 15 mm (current collector). After drying at 110 °C for 5 h in a vacuum oven, circular disks were cut and used as the working electrode. The area of the electrode was 1.76 cm2 with a typical active mass loading of ∼2.0 mg cm−2. To assemble the LIB coin cells, Li metal served as the counter electrode as well as the reference electrode, Celgard 2300 as the separator and 1.0 M LiPF6 in EC:DMC (1:2 vol:vol) as the electrolyte. Fabrication of the coin cells was done inside an argon-filled glove box (M'BRAUN, Germany) where the moisture and oxygen levels were kept at <0.5 ppm. A potentiostat–galvanostat (PGSTAT30, Autolab, the Netherlands) was used for conducting cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests in the potential windows of 0.01–2.0 V and 0.01–3.0 V at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1. An automatic battery tester (BT2000, Arbin, USA) was used for galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements in the same potential windows using a current density of 126 mA g−1 (C/5.5) for the initial formation cycle and at different current densities ranging from 251–1257 mA g−1 (C/2.7 − 1.9C) for subsequent cycles (0.01–2.0 V). For each cycle, charging and discharging were carried out at the same current density. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded on a galvanostat–potentiostat (PGSTAT302N, Autolab, the Netherlands) in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 1 MHz with an AC amplitude of 5 mV.
The electrochemical properties as supercapacitor electrode were evaluated both in three-electrode beaker cells and two-electrode pouch cells. For preparation of the Mn2O3 electrode, the same slurry (as prepared above) was casted on nickel foil of size 2 cm × 2 cm (thickness ∼0.2 mm) and dried at 110 °C for 5 h in a vacuum oven. The typical mass loading of Mn2O3 on the Ni foil was ∼1.0 mg cm−2. Activated carbon (AC) electrodes were prepared from a slurry of AC and PVDF in a weight ratio of 90:10 in NMP following the same procedure of casting and drying. In the three-electrode configuration, a platinum mesh (2 cm × 2 cm) was used as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode. Two-electrode asymmetric pouch cells were assembled with a Mn2O3 electrode as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode. The electrolyte used was 3 M KOH solution in all cases. All electrochemical measurements were carried out by using a galvanostat–potentiostat (PGSTAT302N, Autolab, the Netherlands). CVs were measured at various scan rates ranging from 2 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1 in different potential windows of −1 to 0 V (Pt//AC), 0 to 0.45 V (Pt//Mn2O3) and 0 to 1.4 V (AC//Mn2O3). GCD measurements were carried out at current densities of 0.2–30.0 A g−1 in the potential windows 0.0–0.38 V (Pt//Mn2O3) and 0.0–1.4 V (AC//Mn2O3). EIS measurements were carried out in the frequency range 10 mHz–1.0 MHz at open circuit potential with AC amplitude of 5 mV and the obtained data were fitted to an equivalent circuit model using NOVA 1.9 software.
Results and discussion
Structure, morphology, and thermal stability of MOF derived nanostructured Mn2O3
The formation of the Mn-BTC MOF was checked by XRD. It is known that the crystallinity of Mn-BTC MOF is strongly influenced by the amount of solvent occluded in its pores.49 The observed peaks in the X-ray diffractogram (shown in Fig. S1, ESI†) are very similar to those reported by Taylor et al.50 and Zheng et al.51 confirming successful synthesis of the Mn-BTC MOF. TG analysis (Fig. S2, ESI†) showed that complete decomposition of Mn-BTC takes place at temperatures >480 °C. Accordingly, the as-synthesized Mn-BTC was calcined at 650 °C to ensure complete conversion into Mn2O3. Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffractogram of Mn2O3, thus obtained. All of the observed diffraction peaks correspond to those of the cubic phase of Mn2O3 (space group Ia3) in agreement with the JCPDS data file 00-041-1442. No additional peaks could be detected implying the absence of any possible impurity phases such as MnO or Mn3O4. Rietveld refinement of the phase produced a good fit with Rprofile, (Rp), Rweightedprofile (Rwp) and goodness of fit (χ2) values of 15.650%, 21.949%, and 1.501%, respectively. The obtained lattice constant, a = 9.4128(8) Å, is also in good agreement with literature values.38 Hence, the XRD results indicate formation of Mn2O3 with high purity and crystallinity which is also corroborated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Fig. S3, ESI†). However, a slight disparity was observed between the calculated and experimentally observed peak intensities for the (211) and (222) reflections a suggesting preferred orientation of the Mn2O3 crystallites.

The morphology and microstructure of the parent Mn-BTC MOF and the derived Mn2O3 powders were examined by FESEM and TEM. The FESEM image, shown in Fig. 2a, reveals that the morphology of Mn-BTC consists of bar-shaped particles with corrugated edges. It is known that based on the starting precursor and solvent, different morphologies can result for Mn-BTC.49,50 The morphology observed in the present study is similar to that reported in earlier work where Mn-BTC was synthesized by a solvothermal route in an alcoholic medium.48–50 The dimension of the individual bars was found to be about 1 μm in width and between 2–20 μm in length. As can be seen from the low magnification FESEM image (Fig. 2b), the general bar-shaped morphology of Mn-BTC seems to be retained after conversion into Mn2O3 through calcination. However, high magnification FESEM micrographs of Mn2O3 (Fig. 2c and d) reveal that these bars are actually made of thin porous sheets stacked together where each of these sheets consists of an assembly of numerous spherical nanoparticles, organized like beaded chains. The formation of such a morphology could originate from the presence of channelized pores in Mn-BTC which serve as escape paths for small molecules and gases produced by the thermal decomposition and oxidation of the organic linkers during calcination. A closer look with TEM (Fig. 3a–d) further discloses that these nanoparticles are not spherical, but are actually different shaped polyhedra, assembled in a linear pattern. Formation of differently shaped polyhedra can be explained on the basis of metal–ligand coordination in the metal organic framework. The metal center (Mn) is known to co-exist in various oxidation states ranging from +2 to +7. Therefore, different types of Mn–O coordinations exist in the synthesized Mn-BTC framework which upon calcination would lead to the generation of different shaped and sized polyhedra of Mn2O3 as observed in the present case. This kind of arrangement would also create a large number of voids and spaces resulting in a substantially high surface area. The particles are faceted and well crystallized. Clear lattice fringes could be observed with a spacing of 0.39 nm that correspond to the (211) planes of Mn2O3 (Fig. 3e). In the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3f), observation of well-defined spots arranged in circular rings confirms the formation of well-crystallized polycrystalline Mn2O3 with the characteristic planes clearly identified.

Surface area, pore size and their distributions are very significant parameters for the electrochemical performance of any electrode material whether it is applied for lithium-ion battery or supercapacitor. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the synthesized Mn2O3 and corresponding pore size distributions are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The isotherms were found to be convex in nature up to P/P0 = 1.0, typical for type III isotherms. A small but wide hysteresis loop is observed in the range P/P0 = 0.45–0.95 revealing a mixed H3 and H1 character with a mesoporous structure containing ink-bottle type pores of size <4 nm.52 The corresponding pore size distribution (Fig. 4b), derived from the isotherms, also reveals a mesoporous nature with a combination of narrow and broad size distributions at 4, 6, 7 and 12 nm. The BET surface area of the synthesized Mn2O3 was found to be 44 m2 g−1. Observance of this high surface area value can be attributed to the existence of a large number of voids and spaces, as observed in TEM (Fig. 4). Such morphological features would be highly beneficial for easy access of electrolytes to the active sites and mass transport of Li+ ions by diffusion.
Electrochemical characterization
Lithium-ion battery application
In order to identify the redox processes, cyclic voltammetry experiments were conducted in two potential windows of 0.01–2.0 V and 0.01–3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. The first four successive scans for each potential window are presented in Fig. 5a (0.01–2.0 V) and Fig. 5b (0.01–3.0 V). As expected, in both cases, the first cathodic scan shows similar features. A wide reduction peak positioned at ∼1.3 V indicates conversion of Mn3+ to Mn2+.38,53,54 A sharp cathodic peak observed at ∼0.26 V can be assigned to the conversion of Mn2+ to Mn0 along with the formation of Li2O, and also to the irreversible reactions of organic carbonates in the electrolyte with Li at this low potential forming an SEI layer.55,56 A weak peak appearing at ∼0.94 V may have originated from irreversible partial decomposition of the organic solvents. During the first anodic scan, within 0.01–2 V, only one moderately broad peak is observed at ∼1.29 V (Fig. 5a), representing oxidation of Mn0 to Mn2+ and partial decomposition of Li2O to Li. However, when the potential window is extended to 3 V, a second anodic peak appears at ∼2.19 V due to further oxidation of Mn2+ to Mn3+ (Fig. 5b). Interestingly, from the second cycle onward, there is significant difference in the redox processes, particularly in the cathodic peak due to Mn2+ → Mn0, depending on the potential window employed. In the 2 V window, the voltammograms consist of a single cathodic peak at ∼0.51 V and the corresponding anodic peak at 1.29 V due to the reversible conversion reaction, Mn2+ ↔ Mn0 (Fig. 5a). Disappearance of the initial reduction peaks at 0.94 and 1.31 V corroborates the absence of Mn3+ in the system. The observed shifting of the cathodic peak from 0.26 to 0.51 V is a common phenomenon for transition metal oxides originating from side reactions and structural rearrangements during the initial formation cycle.57 In the 3 V window, two pairs of redox couples are observed at 1.25/2.19 V (Mn3+ ↔ Mn2+) and 0.36/1.29 V (Mn2+ ↔ Mn0). These values are quite consistent with the previously reported values for redox peaks observed in the 3 V window.32,36,37 It is notable that the shifting of the cathodic peak (Mn2+ → Mn0) with respect to the first scan is much lesser in the 3 V window than that observed in the 2 V window. This can be assigned to the field induced sluggish nature of the conversion of Mn3+ to Mn2+ as evidenced by the broad nature of the cathodic peak centered at ∼1.27 V. The anodic and cathodic peak separation is a measure of the degree of the reversibility of a redox process. (ΔVMn2+↔Mn0) was found to be 0.78 and 0.93 V for the 2 V and 3 V windows, respectively. Thus, the cyclic voltammetry results indicate that the Mn2+ ↔ Mn0 redox process would be more reversible when operated in the 2 V window. This is expected to lead to a better cyclability of the cell. Therefore, the electrochemical reactions for Mn2O3 in the potential window of 0.01–2.0 V can be expressed as below, based on a conversion mechanism: 2Li+ + 3Mn2O3 + 2e− → 2Mn3O4 + Li2O(1) 2Li+ + Mn3O4 + 2e− → 3MnO + Li2O(2) 2Li+ + MnO + 2e− ↔ Mn + Li2O(3)
 Fig. 5  First four successive voltammetric scans of Mn2O3//Li cells in the potential windows of 0.01–2.0 V (a) and 0.01–3.0 V (b). 

Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the galvanostatic discharge–charge profiles of Mn2O3 for the first cycle in both the potential windows (2 V and 3 V) at a constant current rate of C/8. The overall nature of the discharge–charge profiles is consistent with other transition-metal oxide anodes undergoing conversion based redox reactions. The first discharge profile is similar in both the potential windows: the potential drops from the open circuit potential (∼2.4 V) to a voltage plateau at ∼1.42 V, which can be linked to the reduction of Mn2O3 to Mn3O4 (eqn (1)). The potential then drops further to ∼0.39 V with a new plateau which may have originated from the reduction of Mn3O4 to MnO (eqn (2)). Thereafter, a long plateau is observed at ∼0.36 V when the conversion reaction occurs with complete reduction of MnO to Mn and the formation of Li2O (eqn (3)). Finally, the potential drops down to the deep discharge limit of 0.01 V gradually forming the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. A high specific capacity of 1140 mA h g−1, about 12% higher than the theoretical value (1018 mA h g−1) is observed in the first discharge cycle. The surplus capacity could possibly be linked to the decomposition of the electrolyte at low potential producing a SEI layer and extra lithium storage at the metal/Li2O interface.58–62 The first charge profiles are also similar up to 2 V for both the potential windows with the appearance of a sloppy voltage plateau between 1.0–1.5 V, which can be related to the oxidation of Mn(0) to form MnO. However, an additional voltage plateau between 2.0–2.5 V is observed in the 3 V window indicating further oxidation of MnO. The initial charge capacities were found to be 778 and 890 mA h g−1 in the 2 V and 3 V windows, respectively. The obtained capacity in the 3 V window of the present MOF derived Mn2O3 is superior to the values reported for Mn2O3 nanostructures synthesized by wet chemical routes.23,27,33 While the 2 V capacity for Mn2O3 has not been reported previously, the observed capacity of 778 mA h g−1 is much higher than other 2 V metal oxide anodes, such as TiO2.63
 Fig. 6  A comparison of the galvanostatic discharge–charge profiles in the initial formation cycle of Mn2O3//Li cells in the potential windows of 0.01–2.0 V and 0.01–3.0 V 

Fig. 7a shows the cyclic performance carried out at 126 mA g−1 (C/5.5) in the potential window of 0.01–2.0 V. It is observed that initially for about 40 cycles there is a sharp decrease in capacity followed by a gradual increase up to about 120 cycles. Thereafter, a capacity of ∼410 mA h g−1 is observed up to 300 cycles. Such behavior is common for transition metal oxide anodes. Initially, during the conversion reaction, a solid SEI layer is formed that resists the delithiation process. Characterization of the electrodes after 5 and 10 cycles was carried out to estimate the degradation. Fig. S4, ESI† shows the PXRD patterns obtained from the electrode after 5 and 10 cycles in the charged state (2.0 V). It was found that the intensity for the Li2CO3 phase (originating from the reaction of Li with electrolyte at lower potentials) increases with cycling indicating a thicker SEI layer. This might explain the observed initial decrease in capacity. A FESEM image of the electrode after 10 cycles (Fig. S5, ESI†) shows partial breakage of the nanobars into smaller particles. Upon continued cycling, a polymeric gel is known to form gradually during cycling which may act as Li+ insertion/de-insertion sites. The steady increase in capacity may also arise from the surface storage by the orderly organization of residual metallic Mn0.64,65 Except for the few initial cycles, the coulombic efficiency approaches 100% demonstrating good reversibility of the cell. Also, no noticeable change in the GCD profiles was observed upon prolonged cycling (Fig. S6, ESI†). Rate performance studies were carried out by cycling the cell between 0.05–2.0 V at different current densities of 251 (C/2.7), 503 (C/1.3) and 1257 mA g−1 (1.9C) for 20 cycles at each rate continuously and the results are presented in Fig. 7b. It can be seen that at comparatively lower current densities of 251 (C/2.7) and 503 mA g−1 (C/1.3), a steady decrease in capacity occurs. This can be assigned to the general declining trend up to ∼40 cycles as observed in Fig. 7a during the cycling test. But between 40 and 60 cycles, even at a high current density of 1257 mA g−1 (1.9C), no significant capacity fading is observed with an average value of ∼150 mA h g−1. Again, to test the capacity restoration ability, the cell was cycled again at 503 (C/1.3) and 251 mA g−1 (C/2.7) for 20 cycles each and capacity values of 214 and 254 mA h g−1 were obtained with no apparent fading. The ability to withstand high charge discharge rates and the prolonged cycle life can be attributed to the unique porous structure of this MOF derived Mn2O3. Fig. 7c shows the Nyquist plots recorded at different cycling stages in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 1 mHz with an equivalent circuit model in the inset. The shapes of the plots comprise of one semicircle at the high to intermediate frequency region (corresponding to the L–C part), followed by a linear component at the low frequency region (Warburg and capacitive part). Analysis of the impedance spectra shows that the as-assembled cell has a low solution resistance (Rs) of 2.2 Ω which increases marginally with cycling and reaches only 4.2 Ω after 300 cycles. This demonstrates the stability of the Mn2O3 electrode where the commonly observed phenomenon of Mn dissolution into the electrolyte is suppressed. Initially, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) increases from 76.9 Ω to 86.6 Ω after the formation cycle. With continued cycling, Rct is found to decrease indicating a gradual increase in the inter-grain charge transfer rate (Table 1). This also explains the observed high rate performance (Fig. 7b) and steady cycling behavior between 100–300 cycles (Fig. 7a).

Electrochemical supercapacitor application
In addition to a 2 V LIB anode, the potential of using MOF derived Mn2O3 as an electrochemical supercapacitor was also examined both in a three-electrode configuration and in a two-electrode asymmetric configuration. The capacitive properties were first studied by cyclic voltammetry in the three electrode configuration using Pt as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode in 3 M KOH electrolyte. The voltammograms, obtained by measuring the current responses for a potential sweep in the range 0.0–0.45 V at different rates ranging from 2 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1, are shown in Fig. 8. The overall shape of the voltammograms is quasi-rectangular with a couple of broad oxidation peaks centered at ∼0.30 and ∼0.35 V and reduction peaks centered at ∼0.24 and ∼0.27 V indicating that the capacitive behavior of Mn2O3 comprises of a prominent pseudocapacitive part (faradic) along with electric double layer capacitance (EDLC; non-faradic). While the origin of EDLC can be related to the adsorption of electrolyte cations (K+ in the present case) on the surface of Mn2O3, pseudocapacitance arises from electron transfer at the Mn sites (Mn3+ ↔ Mn4+) during which the charge balance is maintained by reversible insertion/extraction of OH− from the electrolyte.45 The well crystallized faceted structure of the MOF derived Mn2O3 facilitates the adsorption and subsequent intercalation of OH− into the cubic lattice. Recently, Lin et al.66 showed that in a mixed valence manganese oxide supercapacitor (Mn2O3 and Mn3O4 mixture), charge transfer occurs through conversion of lower valence states of Mn2.67+ (Mn3O4) and Mn3+ (Mn2O3) into higher valence Mn4+. Due to the dominant pseudocapacitive component, the observed CV profiles of the Mn2O3 electrode versus Ag/AgCl (3.0 M KCl) are not perfectly rectangular. From the observations of CV, the following electrochemical reactions can be proposed to account for the pseudocapacitance of Mn2O3: Mn[Mn]O3 + OH− ↔ Mn4+[Mn3+]OH−O3 + e−(4)For pseudocapacitors, the peak current in CV is not constant across the entire potential range. Therefore, galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements were used to calculate the specific capacitance by the following equation: (5)where Cs is the specific capacitance in the three-electrode configuration, I is the discharge current, Δt is the discharge time, ΔV is the potential change during the discharge excluding IR drop and m is the mass of the electrode. As shown in Fig. 9a and b, the GCD profiles at different current densities (0.2–30 A g−1) are quasi-triangular in nature showing typical pseudocapacitive behavior corroborating the observations from CV. No change in the nature of the profiles is observed with an increase in current density up to as high as 30 A g−1. Cs values of 249.7, 244.5, 244, 237.7, 221, 197, 166.4 and 131.5 F g−1 were found at current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 9c). These values are superior to the values reported in the literature for Mn2O3 in the pristine form synthesized by wet-chemical routes,35,40,47 and can be assigned to the mesoporous nature of the MOF derived Mn2O3 providing easy access of the electrolyte to the interior surfaces. The decrease in Cs with increasing current density indicates that the redox processes are diffusion limited. In order to check the cyclability, the cell was subjected to 1000 continuous charge–discharge cycles at a high current density of 10 A g−1 whereby retention of ∼88% of capacitance was observed (Fig. 9d). In further investigation, to mimic the physical configuration of practical cells, two-electrode asymmetric supercapacitor pouch cells were constructed with the MOF derived Mn2O3 as the positive electrode and commercial activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode. Since activated carbon is known to exhibit EDLC behavior, at first, cyclic voltammetry of the AC was carried out against Pt as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode in the potential window of −1.0 to 0.0 V (Fig. S7, ESI†). A capacitance value of ∼80 F g−1 was observed at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 which is comparable to the values reported earlier for AC.67Fig. 10 shows the cyclic voltammograms for the AC//Mn2O3 asymmetric cells at various scan rates ranging from 2 to 100 mV s−1. Notably, the potential window of the cell could be extended up to 1.4 V by combining Mn2O3 with AC. Thus, the energy density could be substantially increased. Similar extension of the potential window has been reported in earlier studies with symmetric Ru//Ru cells (1.8 V),68 and a RuO2//RuO2 cell (1.6 V) in aqueous electrolytes. The observed voltammograms (Fig. 10) are quasi-rectangular indicating dual existence of EDLC and pseudocapacitance. The GCD profiles of these asymmetric cells are shown in Fig. 11a (for current densities of 0.2–2.0 A g−1) and in Fig. S8, ESI† (for current densities of 5 and 10 A g−1). The specific capacities were calculated using the following equation:69 (6)where, C′s is the specific capacitance, I is the discharge current, Δt is the discharge time, ΔV is the potential change during the discharge excluding IR drop and m′ is the average mass of Mn2O3 and AC electrodes. It is known that the specific capacity values of two-electrode cells are always much lower than those obtained from single electrodes in the three-electrode configuration.70 A high specific capacity (Cs) of ∼150 F g−1 could be found at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. Cycling tests conducted at a relatively higher current density of 2 A g−1 showed a ∼75% retention of capacity after 3000 continuous charge discharge cycles (Fig. 11b).

Based on the GCD measurements at different current densities, the energy density (E) and power densities (P) were calculated using the following equations: E = 0.5 × C × V2(7) (8)where, C is the specific capacitance obtained at the respective current density. Supercapacitors are expected to deliver a reasonable energy density at a high power density. Fig. 11c shows the Ragone plots (energy density vs. power density) for both the AC//Mn2O3 and Pt//Mn2O3 cells. An enhancement of nearly an order of magnitude in the energy density is observed for the AC//Mn2O3 asymmetric cell compared to the Pt//Mn2O3 cell at all power densities. The Pt//Mn2O3 cell gives an energy density of 17.7 W h kg−1 at a low power density of 136 W kg−1. In contrast, the AC//Mn2O3 cell delivers an energy density of 147.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1004 W kg−1. Even at a very high power density of 46831 W kg−1, the cell still delivers an energy density of 30.7 W h kg−1. While there is no prior report on AC//Mn2O3 asymmetric cells, the observed energy densities are much higher than those observed for AC//MnO2,71 AC//RuO2,72 AC//AC,73 or even RuO2//RuO2 (18.77 W h kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1).74
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated an easy and scalable route for synthesizing mesoporous Mn2O3 nanobars comprising of a unique beaded-chain particle morphology derived from a Mn-BTC MOF. The synthesized Mn2O3 can be used as a Li-ion battery anode in the 2 V window with a relatively high capacity of ∼410 mA h g−1 at 126 mA g−1 (C/5.5) as well as for supercapacitors with an ultrahigh energy density of 147.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1004 W kg−1. The present work could further stimulate the ongoing search for high performance materials with pre-designed nanoarchitectures for energy storage.
