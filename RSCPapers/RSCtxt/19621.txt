    , Accepted 3rd January 2020First published on 6th January 2020AbstractPoor charge separation and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics are two typical factors that hinder the photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications of hematite. Dual modification via heteroatom doping and surface treatment is an attractive strategy to overcome the above problems. Herein, for the first time, a hematite nanorod photoanode was ameliorated via the fluorine treatment (F-treatment) of both bulk and surface, enabling simultaneous charge separation from the interior to the interface. Accordingly, the novel photoanode (FeFx/F-Fe2O3) exhibited an outstanding PEC water oxidation activity, with a 3-fold improved photocurrent density than that obtained using unmodified α-Fe2O3. More specifically, fluorine doping (F-doping) in the hematite bulk remarkably increased the concentration of charge carriers and endowed it with favorable electrical conductivity for rapid charge transfer. Further surface F-treatment on F-doped α-Fe2O3 (F-Fe2O3) enriched the F–Fe bonds on the surface, which significantly boosted the OER kinetics and thereby inhibited the detrimental charge recombination. As a consequence, the efficiencies of bulk electron–hole pair separation and surface hole injection increased by 2.8 and 1.7 times, respectively. This study points to fluorine modulation as an attractive avenue to advance the PEC performance of metal oxide-based photoelectrode materials.
Introduction
Hydrogen generation via sunlight-powered photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has attracted considerable attention in recent decades in solving the issues of energy supply security and greenhouse gas emission.1–3 Achieving high-efficiency solar conversion hugely depends on the development and design of efficient photoanode materials for water oxidation on account of the slow four-electron reaction kinetics (2H2O = 4H+ + O2 + 4e−).4–6 In this study, transition metal oxides (such as α-Fe2O3, WO3, BiVO4 and ZnO) are the main candidates, which have attracted extensive research.7–10 Hematite, with the outstanding virtues of earth abundance, chemical stability, high theoretical solar conversion efficiency (15%) and a suitable optical band gap (2.2 eV) for light-harvesting, has been considered as one of the most attractive photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.11–14 Regrettably, some of its inherent properties, including poor electrical conductivity, short hole lifetime (3–10 ps) and diffusion distance (2–4 nm), low hole–electron separation and slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, severely constrain its practical application.15–18 Until now, multiple strategies have been employed to alleviate the inherent defects of hematite, including heteroatom doping,19 cocatalyst coupling,20,21 heterojunction/homojunction construction22,23 and morphology engineering.24 Among these, heteroatom doping is an effective means to optimize the PEC water oxidation activity as it can alter the optical band-gap and/or introduce defect levels by transforming the electronic configuration.25 Typically, n-type doping (Sn4+, Ti4+, P5+, Nb5+ and Zr4+) and p-type doping (Zn2+, Mg2+) effectively improve the PEC behaviors by enhancing the electrical conductivity of hematite, which is achieved via changes in electron mobility and carrier concentrations.26–29 Nevertheless, it would ineluctably bring in charge trapping levels between the valence band and the conduction band, consequently resulting in a lower charge separation efficiency.30 The fluorine anion possesses extremely high electronegativity and is a promising donor dopant in metal oxide semiconductors.31 In particular, with an ionic radius similar to that of O ions (F 1.31 Å, O 1.38 Å), fluorine anions partially substitute the lattice oxygen sites in metal oxides, thereby leading to changes in the electronic structure and subsequently having substantial influence on the related PEC activity.32 Our previous research has demonstrated that introducing fluorine anions into the hematite lattice can remarkably improve its PEC behavior.33
Although fluorine doping can ameliorate some intrinsic shortcomings of hematite, a low dopant amount does not make a significant impact on the interfacial charge transport behavior. Surface fluorine anion engineering is a typical chemical avenue to improve the catalytic performance of metal oxides by modulating the adsorption process of the reactant species or oxygen-related intermediates.34 In particular, the enrichment of fluorine anions on the surface increases the polarity of the chemical bonds, thus facilitating OER kinetics through the formation of F–metal bonds with enhanced ionicity.35 For instance, Wang et al. reported an F-modified FeOOH electrode with remarkable OER activity and found that electronegative fluorine regulated the binding energy between the reactant species and the Fe sites.35 Zhong et al. investigated the effects of F-treatment on a Fe2TiO5/Fe2O3 surface and found that an interfacial hydrogen-bond network was formed after immersion into the electrolyte to accelerate hole transfer.36 Recently, Bi et al. modified hematite nanosheets with Pt nanoparticles and FeFx nanolayer, which exhibited excellent PEC performance.37
On the basis of the above considerations, in this work, we modified the α-Fe2O3 nanorod array photoanode by doping the bulk with fluorine anions (F-Fe2O3) and further treating the F-Fe2O3 surface with fluorine (F-treatment), simultaneously boosting charge separation from the interior to the interface. The F-Fe2O3 film was firstly fabricated on the FTO (F-doped SnO2) substrate via a calcination-assisted solution growth method, then an eco-friendly fluorination process was employed to generate an amorphous overlayer on F-Fe2O3in situ (FeFx/F-Fe2O3). Detailed investigations revealed that fluorine doping (F-doping) in bulk not only increased the charge carriers concentration but also enhanced charge mobility, resulting in fast charge transfer and separation. Further, F-treatment of the F-Fe2O3 surface effectively facilitated hole transport into the electrolyte, generating oxygen and thereby suppressing the harmful surface charge recombination. As a consequence, the resulting FeFx/F-Fe2O3 photoanode displayed outstanding PEC water oxidation activity, with a 3-fold improved photocurrent density (2.41 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE) than that achieved with unmodified α-Fe2O3 (0.75 mA cm−−2). Therefore, the elaborate fluorine-treatment from the bulk to the surface is a powerful maneuver to alleviate the inherent shortcomings of hematite.
Experimental section
Materials and chemicals
All the solvents and reagents applied in this work were commercially available and used without further purification. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 30%), ammonium fluoride (NH4F), urea (CO(NH2)2) and chloride(III) hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Sodium sulphite anhydrous (Na2SO3), potassium hydroxide (KOH), ethyl alcohol (C2H6O) and acetone were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Fluorine-doped SnO2-coated glasses (FTO, <15 Ω sq−1) were purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd. A Molecular Lab water purifier was employed to obtain deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm) for the experiments. To obtain clean FTO substrates, deionized water, ethanol, acetone, ethanol and deionized water were utilized to rinse FTO successively with ultrasound for 10 min each.
Preparation of α-Fe2O3 and F-Fe2O3 nanorod photoanodes
The α-Fe2O3 and F-Fe2O3 nanorods array photoanodes were synthesized as reported in our previous work.38 Briefly, 1.5 mmol FeCl3 and 1.5 mmol urea were thoroughly dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water in a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. Then, the clean FTO (F doped SnO2) substrates were placed in the autoclave with the conductive side facing the wall and maintained in the air oven at 100 °C for 500 min. The FTO substrates uniformly covered by the FeOOH nanorod array were fully rinsed with deionized water. In order to obtain the α-Fe2O3 nanorod array, the FeOOH film was calcined at 550 °C for 2 h and 700 °C for 15 min in an Ar atmosphere at the heating rate of 3 °C per minute. The synthesis process for the fluorine-doped α-Fe2O3 (F-Fe2O3) nanorod array anode was the same as that for α-Fe2O3 except that the precursor solution additionally contained a certain amount of NH4F.
Fabrication of FeFx/F-Fe2O3 composite photoanodes
A modified hydrothermal method15 was employed for the in situ fluorination of the F-Fe2O3 surface. In detail, the prepared F-Fe2O3 nanorod array electrodes were immersed in a beaker containing 5 mL H2O2 (30%), 10 mmol NH4F and 10 mL deionized water at 60 °C for different time periods (10 min, 30 min and 60 min). Then, the samples were washed with deionized water and calcined in a tube furnace at 200 °C for 120 minutes in an Ar atmosphere at the heating rate of 8 °C per minute.
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were performed on a Tecnai G2Tf20 at 200 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed using a HITACHI S-4800 to investigate the surface morphology and microstructure of all the composite photoanodes. The elemental mapping of the target electrode was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) via an annular dark-field (ADF) detector. X-ray diffraction spectra (XRD) were recorded at the scan rate of 0.2° s−1 on a Rigaku D/max-2400 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation to study the crystallinity of the samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements were performed on a Kratos Axis Nova X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with monochromated Al Kα as the X-ray source and C 1s as the energy reference (284.6 eV) at the working current and potential of 10 mA and 15 kV, respectively, to investigate the surface composition of the samples. The diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra of the samples were measured on a Hitachi U-4000 spectrometer with BaSO4 as the reference.
Photoelectrochemical test
All electrochemical and photoelectrochemical tests were performed on the CHI760E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments Co.) by employing a three-electrode configuration in 1 M KOH aqueous solution (pH = 13.6). The working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode were the prepared photoanodes, a Pt piece and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl solution), respectively. The immersion area of the working electrode in the electrolyte solution was fixed at 1 square centimetre. A 300 W Xenon arc lamp (Perfect Light solar simulator) installed with an AM 1.5G filter was used as the light source, and the light intensity on the working electrode surface was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun illumination). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were measured at a voltage range of 0.5–1.6 V vs. RHE (VRHE) with a scanning rate of 5 mV s−1. The charge separation efficiency was measured in an electrolyte of 1 M KOH and 1 M Na2SO3. Mott–Schottky (MS) curves were acquired within the voltage range of 0.3–1.4 VRHE under a dark condition with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 and a frequency of 1 kHz. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained with an AC voltage amplitude of 5 mV at a DC bias of 1.05 VRHE under AM 1.5 G illumination (frequency range: 10−1 Hz–105 Hz). The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured on a monochromator with a 300 W Xe lamp as the simulated light source.
Results and discussion
As displayed in Fig. 1a, the F-doped hematite nanorods array anode (F-Fe2O3 NR) were grown on the FTO (F-doped SnO2) glass substrate via a hydrothermal growth process and calcination with F-doped FeOOH NR as the precursor. Subsequently, the as-prepared F-Fe2O3 NR film was immersed in a solution for a certain time period, followed by an annealing process in an Ar atmosphere to obtain the core–shell structured FeFx/F-Fe2O3 NR photoanode. The top-view SEM images (Fig. 1b) demonstrate that the obtained FeFx/F-Fe2O3 NR film consisted of plenty of nanorods of length and diameter about 220 and 52 nm (Fig. 1c), respectively. The top-view and cross-section SEM images (Fig. S1†) show that the hematite film became thicker after F-doping, indicating that the NH4F doping source also plays the role of an inducing agent in adjusting the morphology.39,40Fig. 1d shows the HRTEM image of F-Fe2O3; the lattice fringe distance of 0.25 nm could be attributed to the (110) plane of the hematite phase. In the case of fluorine treatment (F-treatment) on F-Fe2O3, it could be observed that an ultrathin overlayer of about 2 nm was uniformly generated over the surface of the F-Fe2O3 nanorods (Fig. 1e). Fig. 1f distinctly demonstrates that the ecofriendly surface fluorination treatment could create an ultrathin amorphous nanolayer (denoted as FeFx) on the F-Fe2O3 surface. The TEM-EDX element mappings of F-Fe2O3 (Fig. S2†) and FeFx/F-Fe2O3 (Fig. 1g) suggested that the elements Fe, O and F were distributed homogeneously on the nanorods.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed to investigate whether F-treatment changes the crystal structure of hematite (Fig. 2a). Notably, all samples presented similar diffraction peaks, which could be indexed to the hematite phase (JCPDS no. 33-0664) and the SnO2 phase (JCPDS no. 41-14445) of the FTO substrates. Introducing fluorine anions into hematite lattice had no effect on the crystallization of hematite, mainly owing to the low concentration of NH4F added to the precursor solution. The light absorption ability was estimated from the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. S3a†), and the band gap was fitted using the Tauc plots (Fig. S3b†). The light-harvesting capacity was unchanged after F-doping and surface fluorination treatment. The fitted band gap of hematite was 2.1 eV, which agrees well with the value reported in the literature.41 The surface element composition and the chemical binding states of the samples were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 2b shows the detailed Fe 2p high-resolution XPS spectra; the binding energies (BE) of Fe 2 p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 were at 723.65 eV and 710.38 eV, respectively, agreeing well with the values reported for α-Fe2O3.42,43 The binding energy of Fe 2p increased by 0.25 eV after F-treatment on F-Fe2O3, which is due to the attraction between electronegative fluorine and the electrons from the surrounding Fe atoms.35,44 The detailed O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 2c) could be split into two peaks, which were assigned to the lattice oxygen (O2−) and adsorbed oxygen species (OH−).45 The binding energies of the FeFx/F-Fe2O3 O 1s peaks were shifted by 0.38 eV, which was attributed to the strong electron-withdrawing capacity of the adjacent F atoms. Fig. 2d illustrates the F 1s spectral region; no peak signal was detected for F-Fe2O3 due to the low concentration of the fluorine dopant. ICP-OES analysis showed that the concentration of doped fluorine anions in hematite was 1.3%. The F 1s peak of FeFx/F-Fe2O3 centered at 684.5 eV was fully consistent with that of fluorine anions reported in metal fluorides,34,37 which was indicative of the enrichment of the F–Fe bonds on FeFx/F-Fe2O3.

To systematically investigate the effects of fluorine treatment of both bulk and surface on the water splitting performance of the hematite anode, PEC tests were performed by employing a three-electrode cell with 1 M KOH electrolyte under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination. In order to achieve superior PEC behavior, the composite photoanodes were optimized by adjusting the fluorine doping concentration and the surface fluorination time period. Among the tested combinations, the hematite-based photoanode with 15% doping F precursor concentration and 30 min surface F-treatment time obtained the best photocurrent response (Fig. S4†). Fig. 3a displays the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots of the composite anodes, F-doping resulted in a photocurrent density of 1.77 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which was 2.36 times enhanced than that of hematite (0.75 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE). After further F-treatment of the F-Fe2O3 surface, the current density enhanced to 2.41 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. For comparison, we carried out a control experiment with surface fluorination on α-Fe2O3. Notably, the photocurrent response of the bulk- and surface-treated hematite anode was superior to that modified by surface treatment alone (1.21 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE). Interestingly, the onset potential (Eonset) shifted positively after fluorine anions were incorporated into the hematite lattice (Fig. S5†). In general, the kinetic overpotential (Vk) and the open-circuit photovoltage (Vph) are the two typical factors that affect Eonset under illumination.5 The change in Vk after F-doping was negligible (Fig. S6†); thus, the increase in Eonset was mainly attributed to the decrease in Vph. To prove this, Vph was calculated via the open-circuit potential (OCP) decay analysis (Fig. S7†). Obviously, the Vph decreased by 0.15 V after F-doping, which was quite close to the increase (0.14 V) in the Eonset value. The reason for the reduced Vph of hematite maybe that F-doping leads to a severe Fermi pinning effect and a large potential drop at the Helmholtz layer, which needs to be further studied. The Eonset of FeFx/F-Fe2O3 shifted negatively by 0.09 V compared with that of F-Fe2O3, which was approximately equal to the increment in Vph (0.04 V) plus the decrease in Vk (0.04 V). Therefore, although F-doping could effectively enhance the PEC water oxidation activity of hematite, it inevitably led to a decrease in Vph.

Fig. 3b depicts the transient photocurrent response of each electrode under chopped illumination at the potential of 1.23 VRHE. It is known that hematite suffers from sluggish OER kinetics due to detrimental surface hole–electron pair recombination.46 As a result, hematite-based electrodes exhibit intense transient current spikes, indicating heavy current loss at the surface.47 To verify whether surface fluorination treatment facilitates OER kinetics, we analyzed the detailed transient photocurrent response of each photoanode. After F-treatment on α-Fe2O3, the spikes distinctly decreased (Fig. S8†), confirming that surface fluorination effectively reduced surface charge trapping and thereby facilitated the water oxidation process to generate oxygen. The calculated transient photocurrent ratio (Ispike/Isteady) value for hematite was 1.71, which was 1.4 times larger than that for FeFx/α-Fe2O3 (Ispike/Isteady = 1.23), solidly demonstrating that surface F-treatment effectively boosted OER kinetics. The values of Ispike/Isteady for F-Fe2O3 and FeFx/F-Fe2O3 were 1.28 and 1.10, respectively, indicating that F-doping boosted the interfacial water oxidation process, and surface fluorination on F-Fe2O3 further promoted the hole utilization efficiency. To evaluate the light utilization capacity of the composite electrodes, the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was tested at 1.23 VRHE in 1 M KOH electrolyte (Fig. 3c). Apparently, FeFx/F-Fe2O3 exhibited the best IPCE value in the wavelength region from 300 to 600 nm, which corresponds to the LSV plots. The maximum IPCE values were acquired at 300 nm, which were 9.91%, 31.2% and 41.5% for α-Fe2O3, F-Fe2O3 and FeFx/F-Fe2O3, respectively. As an informative indicator of catalytic activity, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was determined under different scan rates (20–220 mV s−1) in a non-faradaic region using the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) values extracted from the cyclic voltammetry CV curves (Fig. S9†). The Cdl was evaluated using the current difference (ΔJ = Ja − Jc) at the different scan rates. As illustrated in Fig. 3d, the ECSA values successively improved after F-doping and F-treatment of the F-Fe2O3 surface. The increase in ECSA after F-doping could be ascribed to the transformation of surface electron configuration caused by the fluorine dopant. A 2-time increase in ECSA after the surface fluorination of F-Fe2O3 implied that F-treatment endowed the surface with more catalytically active sites, which is favorable for promoting the adsorption and activation of reactants or intermediates.48 The obtained ECSA values for α-Fe2O3, F-Fe2O3 and FeFx/F-Fe2O3 were 7.71 μF cm−2, 10.05 μF cm−2 and 15.76 μF cm−2, respectively.
To investigate how F-doping and surface F-treatment influence hematite and enhance its PEC water-splitting performance, Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurement was performed for all the composite anodes in the absence of light. The donor density (ND) was fitted from the slope of the M–S plots using the eqn (S2),† and the flat-band potential (Vfb) was estimated from the x-intercept. As seen in Fig. 4a, all samples exhibited positive slopes, and ND increased after F-doping, suggesting that fluorine anions played the role of a donor (n-type) dopant and the majority carriers were electrons. The calculated ND values for α-Fe2O3, F-Fe2O3 and FeFx/F-Fe2O3 were 9.13 × 1019 cm−3, 4.76 × 1020 cm−3 and 5.49 × 1020 cm−3, respectively. It should be noted that the conventional M–S analysis is only applicable to a planar electrode mode,49 and therefore, the values evaluated here were only used for comparison. The cathodically shifted Vfb (0.47 VRHE) of F-Fe2O3 reflected that F-doping boosted band-bending, which effectively facilitates charge separation and results in enhanced holes transfer efficiency.50 FeFx/F-Fe2O3 exhibited an anodic shift in Efb (0.67 VRHE), suggesting that surface F-treatment on F-Fe2O3 decreased band-bending, which is conducive to promoting charge transport at the anode/electrolyte interface and simultaneously increasing the number of reaction sites at the interface.51

To further study the effect of F-treatment on PEC activity, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was applied to measure the electrochemical behaviour of all the composite anodes under illumination. The original Nyquist plots and the equivalent circuit model used to fit the EIS data are depicted in Fig. S10.† In the equivalent circuit diagram, Cbulk represents the space charge capacitance of the anode bulk, Ctrap represents the capacitance of surface, Rs represents the resistance at the electric contact between the electrolyte and the electrode, Rtrap represents the resistance for charge transfer from the electrode bulk to the surface, and Rct represents the resistance for charge transfer from the surface to the electrolyte.52,53 The smaller semicircle in the high-frequency region reflects the charge transfer from the bulk to the surface of the electrode, whereas the larger semicircle in the low-frequency region indicates the interfacial mass-transfer reaction at the surface.54 Notably, incorporating fluorine anions into hematite resulted in a smaller semicircle in both regions (Fig. 4b, Table S1†), suggesting that F-doping not only promoted charge mobility and transfer remarkably but also changed the surface electronic structure for a faster water oxidation process. After surface F-treatment on F-Fe2O3, a smaller semicircle was obtained in the low-frequency, which manifested that the luxuriant F–Fe bonds on the surface effectively accelerated the water oxidation reaction. To further investigate the charge transfer mechanism, Rct and Rtrap were measured in a wide voltage range from 0.6 to 1.4 VRHE. As shown in Fig. 4c, the smaller Rtrap for F-Fe2O3 implied that F-doping endowed hematite with favorable electrical conductivity for rapid charge transfer. Surface F-treatment on F-Fe2O3 further decreased Rtrap, which indicated that the charge transfer from bulk to the surface proceeded easier in FeFx/F-Fe2O3. The Rct values of F-Fe2O3 were larger than those of pristine α-Fe2O3 in the low voltage region (Fig. 4d), corresponding to negligible photocurrent response at the same potential. It is worth mentioning that both Rct and Rtrap exhibited a similar trend of decreasing initially and increasing with the applied potential. This phenomenon has been observed in previous published works,55,56 but there is no reasonable explanation yet, and further research is needed. Smaller Rct values were obtained for F-Fe2O3 and FeFx/F-Fe2O3 in the larger voltage region, indicating that F-doping and surface F-treatment processes enhanced the charge transport at the anode/electrolyte interface.
The separation efficiencies of hole–electron pairs in the bulk (ηbulk) (Fig. 4e) and on the surface (ηsurface) (Fig. 4f) were calculated to further investigate the effect of F-doping and surface fluorination on the PEC water oxidation behavior using the relevant equations (eqn (3) and (4)) and plots (Fig. S11) displayed in the ESI.† As expected, ηbulk remarkably increased after F-doping, which was ascribed to the enhancement of charge densities and transfer. Furthermore, enhanced ηbulk of FeFx/F-Fe2O3 demonstrated that the photo-induced holes were prone to move to the surface on FeFx/F-Fe2O3. The obtained ηbulk of FeFx/F-Fe2O3 was 32.4%, which is 2.8 times higher than that of pristine hematite (11.5%). The calculated ηsurface of α-Fe2O3, F-Fe2O3 and FeFx/F-Fe2O3 were 45.6%, 62.4% and 80.3%, respectively, confirming that F-doping boosted the interfacial OER kinetics and F-treatment on F-Fe2O3 further facilitated quickening the water oxidation process. The ηsurface decreased in the low voltage region after F-doping, which is consistent with the negligible photocurrent response of F-Fe2O3 at the same potential. In addition, an amperometric i–t plot was charted to evaluate the PEC water oxidation performance of the FeFx/F-Fe2O3 anode (Fig. S12†). Notably, it exhibited good stability and remained unattenuated at 93.5% after 8 h of the PEC test. The detailed comparison of the PEC water oxidation behaviour of the novel FeFx/F-Fe2O3 anode with other reported hematite-based photoanodes is listed in Table S2.†
On the basis of the above findings, a plausible mechanism elucidating the promotion of water oxidation activity by dual-modified hematite is illustrated in Fig. 5. The PEC properties of hematite are seriously hindered by its notorious electrical conductivity, whereas F-doping increases the donor concentration and endows it with favorable conductivity for fast charge transfer. The separated holes are transferred rapidly to the surface along the axial direction of the nanorods, and the electrons move radially to the opposite electrode. Further, surface F-treatment enriches the F–Fe bonds on the surface, which eliminates the partial charge trapping states and effectively facilitates the interfacial water oxidation process.

Conclusions
In summary, we modified hematite via fluorine doping and surface fluorination for enhanced PEC water oxidation, enabling the simultaneous improvement of charge separation from the bulk to the surface. In the absence of a sacrificial reagent, FeFx/F-Fe2O3 was optimized to show an excellent and stable photocurrent response of 2.41 mA cm−2, which is 3.2 times greater than that of pristine hematite (0.75 mA cm−2). To be specific, F-doping significantly enhanced the charge transfer efficiency and eliminated the partial surface charge trapping states, but inevitably led to a decrease in Vph. The following surface fluorination further smoothened the surface trapping states, while the enrichment of Fe–F bonds on the surface instigated an easier water oxidation reaction. The ηbulk and ηsurface values were enhanced to 32.4% and 80.3%, respectively, compared with those of α-Fe2O3 (11.5% and 45.6%). This work demonstrates that elaborate fluorine treatment from the bulk to the surface is a powerful maneuver to alleviate the inherent shortcomings of hematite.
