    , Accepted 14th June 2021First published on 14th June 2021AbstractIn early studies on organic solar cells with high conductivity PEDOT:PSS, the contact between ITO and PEDOT:PSS was considered ohmic. However, because low-conductivity PEDOT:PSS (such as AI4083) is mainly utilized in contemporary solar cells, the contact between ITO and PEDOT:PSS is not ohmic anymore. Despite the high possibility that there are serious interface problems, little attention has been paid to the interface between PEDOT:PSS and ITO. Most of the previous studies of interfaces in organic solar cells have focused on the interface between the active and charge transport layers. In this work, we have employed a conjugated polyelectrolyte that uses potassium poly[9,9-bis(3′-sulfonatopropyl)fluorene-alt-(9-(2,7-diethylheptyl)-carboazole)] (WPFSCz-) between ITO and low-conductivity PEDOT:PSS to overcome complicated organic–inorganic interfacial problems. The insertion of the WPFSCz- layer provides substantial advantages in the operation of polymer solar cells. First, the inserted WPFSCz- layer modifies the work-function of ITO, thereby forming an effective cascading energy alignment, which is favorable for good hole transport. Second, the introduction of the WPFSCz- layer eliminates interfacial trap sites. The reduction in traps reduces recombination losses at the interface, resulting in an improvement in the fill factor. These effects result in a significant increase in the efficiency of non-fullerene solar cells based on PM6 and Y6, from 15.86 to 17.34%. In addition, we have found that the problem of the interface in contact with ITO occurs not only in PEDOT:PSS, but also in oxide-based charge transport layers. We have confirmed that the insertion of the WPFSCz- layer between ITO and an MoO3 (or ZnO) charge transport layer shows the same positive results.
1. Introduction
Interface engineering is an essential technology for high performance bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells.1–3 Since the initial studies of organic solar cells, the introduction of two important structure related technologies, the BHJ active layer and the charge transport layer, has induced significant improvement of OPVs in addition to the development of new donor and acceptor materials.4–7 Many organic and inorganic materials that could function as hole and electron transport layers have been developed and studied to enhance the performance of OPVs. Among them, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is the most widely used charge transfer layer even though it was the first to be used.7,8 Initially, the purpose of the introduction of PEDOT:PSS was to improve the surface morphology of the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode.9 After the discovery that the introduction of PEDOT:PSS improved efficiency more than expected, many studies have been conducted to clarify the exact role of PEDOT:PSS. As a result, it has been found that the role of PEDOT:PSS is to improve not only the interface morphology but also charge transfer characteristics, due to its high work function (WF) and relatively high electrical conductivity.10,11
Why was PEDOT:PSS chosen, of all potential materials? First, PEDOT:PSS was a ‘conducting’ organic material. Although PEDOT:PSS was a relatively poor conductor, as an organic conducting polymer it was an ideal material to serve as a buffer between a semiconducting organic active layer and a conducting inorganic electrode.12 Moreover, PEDOT:PSS had no absorption in the visible region, and it was solution processable, unlike other conductive polymers that were electrochemically synthesized.13 Because of this background, the initial studies on the PEDOT:PSS layer mainly focused on increasing its electrical conductivity. It was simply expected that if the electrical conductivity was improved, the hole transport properties would also be improved. However, research found that the improvement in solar cell performance was always limited even when the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS was significantly enhanced. Instead, when a charge transport layer with high electrical conductivity was introduced, extra currents were induced by lateral transport from an area other than that under the electrode, resulting in an over-estimate of cell efficiency. Since then, PEDOT:PSS with low conductivity (known as AI4083, electrical conductivity: 10−3–10−2 S cm−1) was developed, and this low-conductivity PEDOT:PSS is now used in most devices.14–16
When using high conductivity PEDOT:PSS (e.g., that of Baytron PH or Clevios P, with a conductivity of 10–102 S cm−1), it was assumed that the interface between ITO and PEDOT:PSS was an ohmic contact. Therefore, it was thought that interface problems related to PEDOT:PSS were mostly caused by the interface between the active layer and PEDOT:PSS. As a result, all the studies reported so far have been conducted in the direction of improving the hole transfer characteristics by increasing the electrical conductivity or further increasing the WF of the PEDOT:PSS surface contacting the active layer.17–19 This research strategy did not change significantly even after low-conductivity PEDOT:PSS began to be used predominantly. However, the interface between low-conductivity PEDOT:PSS and ITO is no longer considered to be an ohmic contact. Instead, the interface between low-conductivity PEDOT:PSS and ITO is understood to be similar to the heterogeneous junction of organic polymers and inorganic conductors, so it is highly likely that the interface problem of the initial metal–insulator–metal solar cell was recreated. Of course, due to the high WF value of PEDOT:PSS, it has much better contact properties than a direct contact between an active layer and ITO, but the interface problem between low-conductivity PEDOT:PSS and ITO is clearly a point that has been overlooked up to now.20–22
Of course, it is not until now that there has been no research on the issue between ITO and PEDOT:PSS. In the study reported by Wang et al., they deposited a LiF thin layer on ITO by thermal evaporation to prevent interaction between unbonded surface oxygen in ITO and the ionized hydrogen atom (H+) of sulfonic acid in PEDOT:PSS.23 In the research reported by Kara et al., they applied a self-assembled monolayer on the ITO surface to induce dipole alignment to increase the hole extraction properties in perovskite solar cells.24 In the study reported by Hou et al., an additional MoOx layer was inserted between ITO and PEDOT:PSS in perovskite solar cells.25 In all cases, enhanced photovoltaic performance and device stability were achieved. However, most of these previous studies were focused on the charge extraction capability and the damaging effect by the acidity. Even though the contact properties can be different according to the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, detailed studies according to the characteristics of PEDOT:PSS were omitted. Furthermore, in the last case, because MoOx has intrinsically low conductivity, the same contact problem may occur at the interface with ITO.
In this work, we introduced the use of a conjugated polyelectrolyte between the PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer (HTL) and the ITO bottom electrode to overcome the complicated organic–inorganic interface problem. To confirm the difference between low-conductivity PEDOT:PSS and high-conductivity PEDOT:PSS, three different types of commercial PEDOT:PSS (AI4083, Clevios P, and PH1000) as well as a higher-conductivity PEDOT:PSS sample prepared by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were used in the experiment. The configuration of active materials did not have much influence on the interfacial problem between the HTL and the ITO electrode, but various donor–acceptor configurations, including both fullerene-based and non-fullerene-based BHJ mixtures, were utilized to confirm the unknown effect of the active layer. The conjugated polyelectrolyte used was potassium poly[9,9-bis(3′-sulfonatopropyl)fluorene-alt-(9-(2,7-diethylheptyl)-carboazole)] (WPFSCz-), which has good hole transport properties. In addition, to confirm whether the proposed idea was applicable not only to PEDOT:PSS but also to oxide-based charge transport layers, it was also applied to a solar cell using MoOx and an inverted solar cell with ZnO.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the chemical structure of the conjugated WPFSCz- polyelectrolyte and a schematic illustration of the solar cell structure used in this study. WPFSCz- has a similar backbone structure to PFN-based conjugated polyelectrolytes that are already widely used for the surface modification of inorganic metal oxides such as ZnO and MoO3.26–28 Thus, we expected that it can be well combined with ITO, which is a similar oxide material. In addition, because WPFSCz- has a conjugated backbone, there would be no significant physical contact problems with the PEDOT:PSS surface. Details regarding the synthesis of WPFSCz- are provided in the Experimental section. The prepared WPFSCz- was spin-coated onto a pre-cleaned ITO surface, and then an HTL layer was deposited by spin coating. For the photoactive layer materials, we used a PBDB-T-2F (also called PM6) donor and Y6 non-fullerene acceptor, which currently receive the most attention in OPV research. In addition, solar cells with a fullerene-based BHJ blend of PTB7-Th:PC71BM and with a non-fullerene-based BHJ blend of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F were also tested (see ESI, Fig. S1 and S2†).

Fig. 2 shows the effect of the inserted WPFSCz- on current density (J)–applied voltage (V) characteristics according to the type of PEDOT:PSS. The conductivity values measured by the van der Pauw method were 0.005, 0.026, 6.849, and ∼103 S cm−1 for AI4083, Clevios P, PH1000, and PH1000 with 5% DMSO, respectively. In all cases, the solar cells with a WPFSCz- layer showed improved performance compared to the solar cells without a WPFSCz- layer. The difference in performance according to the presence or absence of WPFSCz- was greater when the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS was lower. For AI4083, which showed the biggest difference, the PBDB-T-2F:Y6 solar cell without the WPFSCz- layer had a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.86% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.643 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.864 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 71.58%, while the solar cell with the WPFSCz- layer had a PCE of 17.34% with a Jsc of 26.824 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.864 V, and a FF of 74.83%. The details related to the performance of these solar cells are listed in Table 1 and the histograms of solar cell performance parameters are presented in the ESI (Fig. S3†). This performance difference almost disappeared as the conductivity was increased. The diminishing performance difference occurred because, as mentioned above, the contact problem between PEDOT:PSS and ITO became negligible as the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS increased. Instead, the problem seemed to have moved from the interface between PEDOT:PSS and ITO to the interface between PEDOT:PSS and the active layer. This was confirmed by the significantly improved performance caused by the treatment of the interface between PEDOT:PSS and the active layer with hydroquinone (HQ) in a device using PH1000.29

To explore the influence of the inserted WPFSCz- layer between ITO and PEDOT:PSS on Jsc in detail, J–V curves were replotted with net photocurrent density (Jph) vs. effective voltage (Veff) using dark current density, as shown in Fig. 3. A detailed theoretical background for Jph–Veff analysis is provided in previous work.30,31 From the Jph–Veff analysis, the exciton generation rate (Gmax) and the charge separation probability (P(E,T)) can be extracted using the relationship Jsat = q × L × Gmax and the ratio Jph/Jsat, where Jsat is the saturation current density, and q and L are the elementary charge and the thickness of the active layer, respectively.32 The extracted Gmax and P(E,T) values are listed in Table 2. In the case of Gmax, the inserted WPFSCz- layer had no effect. However, P(E,T) showed a markedly enhanced value in the device with the WPFSCz- layer. The degree of increase in P(E,T) decreased as the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS increased. P(E,T) is basically influenced by either the exciton dissociation efficiency or the charge collection efficiency.33,34 Because we used the same active layer, exciton dissociation efficiency would be the same for each device. Therefore, it can be said that the increase in P(E,T) mostly came from the improvement of charge collection efficiency.

The main factors affecting the charge collection efficiency are charge recombination and charge extraction. First, by measuring the change of Jsc or Voc depending on the intensity of the incident light, the change in charge recombination according to the insertion of a WPFSCz- layer was analyzed. In the Jscvs. light intensity plots (Fig. 4a–d), all of the fitted α values approached 1.0, indicating that all of the devices were nearly free from bimolecular recombination loss.35,36 However, in the Vocvs. light intensity plots (Fig. 4e–h), a clear difference was observed between solar cells with and without a WPFSCz- layer. In the case of solar cells using AI4083, the extracted slope value was 1.638 kT/q for the solar cell without a WPFSCz- layer, while a much smaller slope value of 1.303 kT/q was observed in the solar cell with a WPFSCz- layer. The reduced slope indicated that trap-assisted interfacial recombination was indeed suppressed by the insertion of a WPFSCz- layer. Consistent with other experimental results, this difference became smaller in the solar cell with higher conductivity PEDOT:PSS.

The improvement of the charge extraction ability by the reduction of trap-assisted interfacial recombination was also evident in many other characterization experiments. Transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were carried out to probe the difference of charge carrier dynamics between the solar cells with and without a WPFSCz- layer. The TPV measurements conducted under open-circuit conditions (Fig. 5a) showed that the solar cell with a WPFSCz- layer beneath the PEDOT:PSS had a much longer decay time. In general, it is known that a voltage decrease in a TPV measurement is caused by the recombination of electrons and holes at defect sites.37,38 Therefore, this longer decay time indicated that the recombination that occurred between ITO and AI4083 was effectively controlled by the insertion of a WPFSCz- layer. This also meant that the interfacial defect site that existed between ITO and AI4083 as a recombination location had been effectively removed by the WPFSCz- layer. Recalling that the performance improvement in the solar cell with a WPFSCz- layer was achieved by FF improvement, the TPV result showing a reduction in interfacial recombination was consistent with the J–V results. Fig. 5b shows the photocurrent decay profile under short circuit conditions. The solar cell with a WPFSCz- layer exhibited a shorter decay time compared to the devices without a WPFSCz- layer.

The improved charge extraction capability due to the reduction of trap-assisted interfacial recombination by the insertion of a WPFSCz- layer can also be confirmed by impedance spectroscopy (IS) analysis.39 Basically, non-modulated IS (Fig. 5c) showed a clearly reduced series resistance in solar cells with a WPFSCz- layer. In addition, intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS, Fig. 5d) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS, Fig. 5e) also showed a reduced transit time (τtran) and significantly increased recombination time (τrec) in the solar cell with a WPFSCz- layer (see Table 3). Charge collection efficiencies (ηc) obtained via the relationship ηc = 1 − (τtran/τrec) were 96.5 and 92.9% for solar cells with and without a WPFSCz- layer, respectively.40–42 These results were consistent with the results obtained from Jph–Veff analyses and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) measurements. To investigate directly the trap density change caused by the insertion of a WPFSCz- layer, the frequency-dependent capacitance was measured, and then the trap density was extracted from the derivative of the capacitance.43 A comparison of the distributions of trap density extracted from the low frequency regions of the frequency-dependent capacitance (Fig. S4†) showed that the trap density of the solar cell with a WPFSCz- layer was clearly lower than that of the solar cell without a WPFSCz- layer.

To further investigate the trap elimination by the insertion of the WPFSCz- layer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out. Fig. 6 shows the O 1s spectra of WPFSCz- films with different thicknesses. Additional shoulders at 533 eV and a narrower FWHM from O 1s XPS spectra were observed when the WPFSCz- films were deposited on the ITO substrate. The differential features were presented together at the bottom of Fig. 6a. The O 1s spectrum of ITO is generally deconvoluted into three symmetric components (Fig. 6b).44–46 The highest binding energy component at 532.60 eV (±0.01 eV) is associated with the oxygen interacting with carbon (O–C), which is routinely observed even on clean ITO surfaces that have been exposed to air. The lowest binding energy component at 530.40 eV is assigned to the O metal in the lattice. The medium binding energy component at 531.65 eV (±0.01 eV) corresponds to oxygen deficient regions, which are called oxygen vacancies (normally, O–H) acting as a defect or trap.47,48 When the area of oxygen vacancies (O–H feature, red area) of the reference ITO was 1.0, it was observed that the area of O–H features decreased relatively to 0.88 for the thin WPFSCz- film and 0.66 for the thick WPFSCz- film (see Table S1† for the details on peak splitting information). Fig. S5† shows binding energy shift in the indium XPS spectra combined with oxygen on the ITO substrate, which is not observed on the Au substrate. The delta value of the indium XPS spectra shows a decrease in the value at 454 eV and 446 eV, which is confirmed by the decrease in In–OH due to the decrease in O–H shown in the oxygen XPS (Fig. S5a†).44 This clearly shows that the intensity of this oxygen vacancy peak decreased with WPFSCz- layer deposition which means that the relative number of defects was decreased with WPFSCz- deposition (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  (a) O 1s XPS spectra and (b) O 1s XPS spectra peak separation of WPFSCz- films on ITO substrates. 
In addition to removing defect sites, the deposition of the WPFSCz- layer modified the energy level and formed a cascading energy alignment, which was favorable for charge transport (Fig. 7). The WF of pristine ITO was measured to be 4.65 eV. The WF of ITO covered with a WPFSCz- layer increased to 4.98 eV. The WF of AI4083 was measured to be 5.18 eV regardless of whether it was deposited directly on the ITO or a WPFSCz- layer was deposited on the ITO prior to AI4083 being deposited. Furthermore, the surface potential difference also observed in the Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) measurement was caused by self-aligned surface electric dipoles (see Fig. S6 in the ESI†).49–51 The contact potential differences were measured with a cantilever tip coated with rhodium (WF = 4.72 eV) under a −600 mV bias. All KPFM images showed a uniform potential difference. The contact potential difference value of ITO had a positive value, which indicated that the Fermi level of ITO was lower than that of the biased tip, while the negative contact potential value indicated a higher Fermi level compared to the biased tip. When WPFSCz- was coated on the ITO surface, the contact potential difference value dramatically changed. A direct comparison between ITO/AI4083 and ITO/WPFSCz-/AI4083 indicated that the insertion of WPFSCz- induced a higher contact potential difference. Consequently, benefiting from these cascade energy alignment and surface potential modification of ITO/WPFSCz-/AI4083 together with the defect elimination effect, the WPFSCz- layer improved the charge carrier extraction ability and the reduction of the extraction time as shown in the TPV, TPC, and IS measurements (Fig. 5a–c).

Such interface problems seem to exist somewhat between ITO and low-conductivity PEDOT:PSS, as well as between a metal oxide-based charge transport layer and ITO. When we applied a WPFSCz- layer between a MoOx HTL and ITO, a similar improvement effect was observed (see Fig. S7†). A solar cell with an inverted structure using a ZnO electron transport layer also exhibited the same improvement (Fig. S8†). In the case of ZnO, PFN-Br was utilized instead of WPFSCz- due to the energy level issue. The light intensity dependent Voc experiment (Fig. S9c†) showed that trap-assisted recombination was reduced with the introduction of PFN-Br between ITO and ZnO. Therefore, it can be concluded that it was due to the same effect as using WPFSCz- under PEDOT:PSS.
3. Conclusion
We have employed a WPFSCz- conjugated polyelectrolyte layer to overcome the organic–inorganic interface problem between low-conductivity PEDOT:PSS (AI4083) and high-conductivity, inorganic ITO electrodes. The insertion of the WPFSCz- layer provided substantial advantages in the operation of non-fullerene-based polymeric solar cells. First, the inserted WPFSCz- layer reduced recombination losses at the interface by the elimination of interfacial trap sites, resulting in an improvement in FF. Second, the deposition of the WPFSCz- layer modified the WF of ITO. WPFSCz- coated ITO had a WF value between the WF values of pure ITO and PEDOT:PSS, thereby forming an effective cascading energy alignment, which is favorable for hole transport. Benefiting from the cascading energy alignment and the surface potential modification together with the defect elimination effect, the best PCE of a solar cell based on PM6 and Y6 significantly increased from 15.86 to 17.34%. In addition, we found that the problem of the interface in contact with ITO occurred not only in PEDOT:PSS but also in oxide-based charge transport layers. It was confirmed that the insertion of the conjugated polyelectrolyte layer between a MoO3 (or ZnO) charge transport layer and ITO showed the same results.
4. Experimental
WPFSCz- synthesis
All reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich, TCI Chemical Co., and Strem Chemicals Inc., and were used without further purification. 9-(2,7-Diethylheptyl)-2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9H-carbazole, 2,7-dibromo-9,9-bis(4-sulfonatobutyl)fluorene dipotassium, and potassium poly[9,9-bis(3′-sulfonatopropyl)fluorene-alt-(9-(2,7-diethylheptyl)-carboazole)] (WPFSCz-) were prepared according to procedures described in the literature.52–54
Device fabrication
ITO substrates were cleaned with detergent and ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 15 min each. After a UV–ozone surface treatment, solutions with 0.01 wt% of WPFSCz- in distilled water and methanol (4:1) were spin-coated on ITO at 5000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. An HTL of PEDOT:PSS (AI4083, Clevios P, PH1000, or PH1000 + 5% DMSO) was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer was 40–50 nm. The substrates were then transferred to an N2-filled glovebox. The active layer solution was made with a 1:1.2 ratio of PBDB-T-2F and Y6 in chloroform with 0.5% 1-chloronaphthalene as a processing additive to achieve a better phase-separated morphology. The active layer was deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 40 s. A Phen-NaDPO solution (0.5 mg ml−1 in IPA) was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s on top of the PBDB-T-2F:Y6 layer as an electron transport layer. Finally, 100 nm of aluminum was deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of 2 × 10−6 Torr. The device area was 0.13 cm2. For the solar cells with MoOx HTL, MoOx sol–gel solution was spin coated on the WPFSCz- layer at 5000 rpm followed by annealing at 50 °C for 10 min in air. The MoOx sol–gel solution was synthesized following a method described elsewhere.55
The inverted polymer solar cells were fabricated using ZnO as the electron transport layer. For the preparation of ZnO sol–gel solution, 0.75 M zinc acetate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O] was dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol containing ethanolamine as a stabilizer. The ZnO sol–gel was spin coated on the WPFSCz- layer at 5000 rpm followed by annealing at 150 °C for 10 min and 180 °C for 5 min in air. The substrates were then transferred to an N2-filled glovebox. The active layer solution was made with a 1:1.2 ratio of PBDB-T-2F and Y6 in chloroform with 0.5% 1-chloronaphthalene. The active layer was deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, a 6 nm MoO3 hole transport layer was deposited by thermal evaporation onto the active layer. 100 nm Ag was also deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of 2 × 10−6 Torr. The device area was 0.13 cm2.
Device characterization
The power conversion efficiencies of the organic solar cells were measured from J–V curves using a Keithley 2401 source measurement unit under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 irradiation from a solar simulator (Newport Co., Oriel). To calibrate the intensity of the solar simulator, a standard Si-photodiode detector with a KG-3 filter (Newport Co., Oriel) was used. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a quantum efficiency measurement system solar cell spectral response/QE/IPCE (Newport Co., Oriel IQE-200B). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard, single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
Conductivity measurements
The surface conductivities of PEDOT:PSS (AI4083, Clevios P, PH1000, and PH1000 + 5% DMSO) were determined using a Hall effect measurement system (Ecopia model no. HMS-5000). The thicknesses of the films were measured using a Dektak XT surface profiler. These samples were fabricated by spin-coating WPFSCz- and PEDOT:PSS on the same ITO substrates that were used for solar cell fabrication.
Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) measurements
The surface properties of ITO, ITO with WPFSCz-, PEDOT:PSS, and PEDOT:PSS with WPFSCz- were characterized with a NanoNavi II AFM system (SII Nano Technology Inc.) in tapping mode. The WF of ITO, pristine PEI, and colloidal-quantum-dot-doped PEI was measured with a KPFM (KP 6500 Digital Kelvin probe, McAllister Technical Services. Co. Ltd). The samples for the KPFM measurements were fabricated in the same way as the samples for the conductivity measurements.
Impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements
Non-modulated IS, IMVS, and IMPS were performed using an impedance analyzer (IVIUM Tech., IviumStat) at an open circuit voltage over a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1.0 MHz under illumination conditions with a red light emitting diode light source (λ = 635 nm).
Transient photovoltage and photocurrent measurements
TPC and TPV measurements were conducted using the analyzer function of an organic semiconductor parameter test system (McScience T4000) at VOC under 1 sun illumination.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements
Photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out with an ESCALAB 250-XI surface analysis system equipped with a He discharge lamp providing He–I photons of 21.22 eV for UPS analysis and a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray gun with photon energies of 1486.6 eV for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization. The base vacuum pressure of the analysis system was ∼10−7 Torr. The Fermi edge was calibrated using a clean ITO film, and all spectra presented were plotted with respect to the determined Fermi level. All XPS measurements were calibrated with reference to the In 3d5/2 core level (443.9 eV) of a freshly prepared ITO film.
