1. Introduction
In the 21st century, hydrogen is a potential candidate for a clean and high-energy density energy carrier. H2 itself is a clean material, because the combustion of H2 produces only pure water with a large amount of heat release. H2 + 1/2O2 → H2O; ΔG0 = −237 kJ mol−1(1)However, H2 is currently produced by reforming reactions of hydrocarbon resources such as the steam reforming of methane.1 CH4 + 2H2O → 4H2 + CO2; ΔG0 = 131 kJ mol−1(2)In these cases, H2 production is always accompanied by CO2 formation, meaning that such H2 should not be regarded as a clean energy carrier. From this point of view, the only clean hydrogen resource on the earth is water, by the reverse reaction of (1). H2O → H2 + 1/2O2; ΔG0 = 237 kJ mol−1(3)This reaction is, of course, accompanied by a large amount of energy release; therefore, it is essential that this process utilizes clean and recyclable energies to drive reaction (3).2–5 There may be several candidates, such as hydraulic power, wind force and even nuclear power. Among them, solar energy is one of the most favorable energy resources because it is essentially clean and inexhaustible, and it sustains all life on the earth. Table 1 provides information regarding solar energy. The sun is steadily emitting a large amount of energy (1.2 × 1034 J year−1) and only a small portion of it is utilized for energy production on the earth. Approximately one half of the energy (3.0 × 1024 J year−1) can penetrate the atmosphere to reach the sea and land surfaces.6,7 This is the energy available for use on the earth. It should be emphasized that the photosynthesis reaction in nature fixes 0.1% of the solar energy on the earth. The energy consumption in the world by human beings (4.0 × 1020 J year−1) is about 0.01% of the solar energy.6,7 It is also interesting that the total amount of energy accumulated in all fossil resources corresponds to the solar energy received by the earth over only 7 days. The amount of solar energy available on the earth far exceeds that required to maintain modern civilization; however, if the surface area used to fix sufficient solar energy to maintain civilization was estimated, it would be very large. Even if a system with a solar energy conversion efficiency of 10% was available, the area required would be in the order of 105 km2. This means that the method of solar energy conversion has to have applicability to such a wide area.
Table 1 Amount of solar energy











The decomposition of water into H2 and O2 using heterogeneous photocatalysts is one method for the conversion of solar energy into chemicals,2–7 including biomass conversion and the electrolysis of water using a solar cell, and was initiated by the work of Honda and Fujishima, who demonstrated that overall water splitting can be achieved using a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell consisting of a single-crystalline TiO2 (rutile) anode and a Pt cathode under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and with an external bias.8,9
2. Bases of photocatalytic water splitting
2.1 Band structure
Photocatalytic reactions proceed on semiconductor materials, as schematically shown in Fig. 1. Semiconductors have a band structure in which the conduction band is separated from the valence band by a band gap of suitable width. When the energy of incident light is larger than that of the band gap, electrons in the valence band are excited to the conduction band and holes are generated in the valence bands. The photogenerated electrons and holes cause redox reactions similar to electrolysis. Water molecules are reduced by electrons to form H2 and oxidized by the holes to form O2 to provide overall water splitting. The important characteristics of the semiconductor photocatalyst materials are the width of the band gap and the levels of the conduction and valence bands. The lower level of the conduction band must be more negative than the redox potential of H+/H2 (0 V vs. NHE). Furthermore, the top level of the valence band must be more positive than the redox potential of O2/H2O (1.23 V). Therefore, the theoretical minimum band gap for water splitting is 1.23 eV, which corresponds to light of approximately 1100 nm. Not all semiconductors that satisfy the above conditions can decompose water into H2 and O2. As determined from the band structure, some chalcogenide semiconductors, such as CdS, are regarded as suitable photocatalysts for the cleavage of water under visible light irradiation. However, CdS rather than H2O is oxidized by photogenerated holes, which is accompanied by the elution of Cd2+ according to Eq. (4).10 CdS + 2 h+ → Cd2+ + S(4)This reaction is referred to as photocorrosion and is often a disadvantage for metal sulfide photocatalysts. ZnO also undergoes photocorrosion under band gap excitation, even though it is an oxide photocatalyst. ZnO + 2 h+ → Zn2+ + 1/2O2(5)

As shown in Fig. 2, the overall water splitting reaction on a semiconductor photocatalyst occurs in three steps: (1) the photocatalyst absorbs photon energy greater than the band gap energy of the material and generates photoexcited electron-hole pairs in the bulk, (2) the photoexcited carriers separate and migrate to the surface without recombination, and (3) adsorbed species are reduced and oxidized by the photogenerated electrons and holes to produce H2 and O2, respectively. The first two steps are strongly dependent on the structural and electronic properties of the photocatalyst. Generally, high crystallinity has a positive effect on catalytic activity, because the density of defects, which act as recombination centers between photogenerated carriers, decreases with increasing crystallinity. However, the third step is promoted by the presence of a solid co-catalyst. The co-catalyst is typically a noble metal (e.g., Pt, Rh) or a metal oxide (e.g., NiO, RuO2), which is loaded onto the photocatalyst surface as a dispersion of nanoparticles to produce active sites and reduce the activation energy for gas evolution. While co-catalysts are essential to bring out the potential photocatalytic performance in photocatalysts, especially visible light-driven photocatalysts, all of the functions of each co-catalyst have not yet been clarified; the optimal combination of co-catalyst and photocatalyst is different for each photocatalyst. Therefore, it is important to design both the bulk and surface properties of a photocatalyst material carefully, so as to obtain high photocatalytic activity for the reaction.

2.2 Water cleavage by particulate photocatalysts and photocatalyst electrodes
The photocatalytic cleavage of water is morphologically divided into water splitting by using particulate photocatalysts and photocatalyst electrodes. The photoelectrochemical cell comprised of TiO2 and Pt electrodes developed by Honda and Fujishima has resulted in a large number of photoelectrochemical cells that are designed specifically for the efficient utilization of solar energy. However, due to the lack of suitable photoelectrode materials with appropriate band gap structures and stability, the systems proposed to date have been developed into complicated integrated multilayer and tandem systems.11–13 On the other hand, many solid materials have been developed to date for the cleavage of water using particulate photocatalysts. The concept of water splitting using a particulate photocatalyst is simple. Sunlight shines on photocatalyst particles dispersed in a pool with water, and hydrogen is then readily evolved. Moreover, powdered photocatalyst systems are advantageous for large-scale solar water-splitting applications, due to the simplicity of design. While many serious and fundamental problems remain, such as how to construct such a pool without leaking of evolved H2 and O2, how to transfer water to a pool in an area under large solar irradiation, how to separate H2 from the explosive H2 and O2 mixture, and total life cycle assessment, studies using particulate photocatalysts have revealed that many solid materials function as stable photocatalysts for water cleavage. These materials will provide new developments and advance water cleavage technology using photoelectrochemical cells that are favorable for the separation of H2 from a H2 and O2 mixture.
2.3 Materials available for the photocatalytic cleavage of water
Until the middle of the 1980s, research on particulate photocatalysts for overall water splitting was largely devoted to SrTiO3 and TiO2.14–17 Since the discovery of K4Nb6O17, which has a layered structure and high photocatalytic activity,18,19 photocatalysts with unique structures, such as layered, tunnel, and pillared structures, have also been reported.20–25 Since the latter half of the 1990s, many tantalates have been reported to be highly active photocatalysts.24,26–30 ZrO2 has also been reported to be a unique photocatalyst, exhibiting high activity even without a co-catalyst.31 Inoue and co-workers reported typical metal oxides with d10 electronic configuration as a new class of photocatalysts suitable for overall water splitting.32–38Fig. 3 shows the groups of elements that can form suitable band gap structures of the corresponding oxide materials, and which have been successfully applied as photocatalysts for overall water splitting. In all cases, the oxidation states of the metallic elements in such photocatalysts are the highest, that is, Ti4+, Zr4+, Nb5+, Ta5+ and W6+ in the red group, and Ga3+, In3+, Ge4+, Sn4+, and Sb5+ in the green group (as indicated in Fig. 3). Photocatalysts based on transition-metal cations with empty d orbitals are defined as having a d0 electronic configuration (red group). On the other hand, those based on typical element cations with filled d orbitals are defined as having a d10 electronic configuration (green group). Although other metal oxides with d0 or d10 electronic configurations, such as V5+, Mo6+, and Zn2+, cannot decompose water by themselves, Z-scheme type reaction systems containing these elements function as catalysts for the photocatalytic cleavage of water (see below).

3. Wide band gap photocatalysts that decompose water into H2 and O2 under UV-light irradiation
3.1 Oxides with d0 electronic configuration

3.1.1 Group 4 metal oxides. 
TiO2 was the most well-known photocatalyst for the cleavage of water under UV-light irradiation, since the discovery of the Honda-Fujishima effect, with overall water splitting achieved with a photoelectrochemical cell using a TiO2 electrode with some external bias.8,9 However, this abundant oxide particulate itself cannot decompose water without any bias. Photocatalytic cleavage of water does not proceed on TiO2 loaded with Pt, which is usually an excellent co-catalyst for the reduction of H+, because Pt also functions as a catalyst for the rapid formation of H2O from the H2 and O2 produced. Sato et al. found that NaOH-coated TiO2 decomposes water vapor into H2 and O2, because the reverse reaction on Pt is suppressed.39 The photocatalytic cleavage of water by particulate TiO2 suspended in aqueous solution was realized 25 years after the discovery of the Honda-Fujishima effect, although this reaction system requires a large amount of NaCO3; complex photoreactions with NaCO3, in addition to the redox reaction on the TiO2 photocatalyst under UV light, result in overall water splitting.40
SrTiO3 is also a well-known photocatalyst. The potential of the conduction band edge of SrTiO3 is more negative (ca. −0.3 V vs. NHE at pH = 0) than that of TiO2 (ca. −0.1 V vs. NHE at pH = 0), so that SrTiO3 can be used to split water without an external bias, unlike TiO2.41,42 Domen and co-workers first succeeded in the photocatalytic cleavage of water on a particulate NiO-loaded SrTiO3 photocatalyst suspended in water.17,43–46 The NiO co-catalyst for H2 evolution is usually activated by H2 reduction and subsequent O2 oxidation to form a NiO/Ni double layer structure that is convenient for electron migration from the photocatalyst substrate to the co-catalyst.44 The pretreated NiO co-catalyst is often denoted as NiOx in the literature. It should be noted that the reverse reaction between H2 and O2 does not proceed on the NiO co-catalyst, which is distinct from the Pt co-catalyst. The excellent NiO co-catalyst has often been employed with many overall water-splitting photocatalysts. Rh is also a suitable co-catalyst for the SrTiO3 photocatalyst.16 Many Ti4+-containing oxide photocatalysts such as Sr3Ti2O7,47 Sr4Ti3O10,48 La2Ti2O7,25,49–57 Ba-doped La2Ti2O7,49 KLaZr0.3Ti0.7O458 and La4CaTi5O1725 that have layered perovskite structures, i.e. perovskite slabs of SrTiO3, provide high quantum yields for the cleavage of water under UV light.
Some Ti4+-containing oxide photocatalysts exhibit high performance for the cleavage of water, due to their unique structures. A2La2Ti3O10 (A: K or Rb) is a layered Ti4+-perovskite similar to the Ti4+-containing oxides previously mentioned, and water molecules are intercalated into the interlayer spaces, as shown in Fig. 4. The photocatalytic cleavage of water by NiOx-loaded Rb2La2Ti3O10 is shown in Fig. 5.22,59 Highly efficient reactions proceed on the photocatalyst, which are attributed to the specific structure of A2La2Ti3O10 with intercalated water molecules in the interlayer spaces, as shown in Fig. 6. Holes generated in the layered perovskite oxidize water molecules to produce O2, and photoelectrons reduce H+ to H2 through the NiOx co-catalyst particles loaded only on the external surface of the photocatalyst; H2 and O2 evolution at different reaction sites causes efficient charge separation, resulting in the high performance. Such reaction systems that depend largely on specific structures are also found for Na2Ti6O1320,60–62 and BaTi4O921,62–67 with tunnel structures. In this case, it is expected that distortion in the crystals plays an important role in efficient charge separation.

 Fig. 6  Schematic mechanism for the cleavage of water by A2La2Ti3O10. 
ZrO2 is also one of the group 4 oxide photocatalysts able to decompose water into H2 and O2.31,68–71 ZrO2 has a considerably wide gap (ca. 5 eV), and the potentials of the conduction and valence band edges reach −1 and +4 V vs. NHE at pH = 0, respectively. This means that ZrO2 has excess overpotentials for the reduction of H+ and the oxidation of H2O, resulting in overall water splitting without a co-catalyst. This photocatalyst is active even for CO2 reduction to CO accompanied with O2 evolution by the oxidation of water without any sacrificial reagents.31


3.1.2 Group 5 metal oxides. 
It has been reported that many oxides containing Nb5+ or Ta5+ function as photocatalysts for the cleavage of water. Several Nb5+ oxides such as K4Nb6O17,18,46,72–78 Rb4Nb6O17,77 Ca2Nb2O7,25 Sr2Nb2O7,25,79–81 Ba5Nb4O15,82 NaCa2Nb3O10,83 ZnNb2O6,84 Cs2Nb4O1185 and La3NbO755,86 are photocatalysts for overall water splitting in UV light. In the case of Ta5+ oxides, Ta2O5,68 K2PrTa5O15,87 K3Ta3B2O12,88 LiTaO3,89 NaTaO3,26,28 KTaO3,26,28,77 AgTaO3,90 Zr-doped KTaO3,91,92 La-doped NaTaO3,30,93 Sr-doped NaTaO3,94 Na2Ta2O6,95 K2Ta2O6,95,96 CaTa2O6,97 SrTa2O6,97 BaTa2O6,26,97 NiTa2O6,26 Rb4Ta6O17,77 Ca2Ta2O7,95 Sr2Ta2O7,79–81,98 K2SrTa2O7,99 RbNdTa2O7,27,100–102 H2La2/3Ta2O7,103 K2Sr1.5Ta3O10,104 LiCa2Ta3O10,105 KBa2Ta3O10,25 Sr5Ta4O15,98 Ba5Ta4O15,106 H1.8Sr0.81Bi0.19Ta2O7,107 Mg-Ta oxide,108 LaTaO4,109 and La3TaO7,55,86 have been reported as active photocatalysts. The band structures of the Ta5+ oxides have excess overpotentials for the reduction of H+ and oxidation of H2O, similar to that for ZrO2. Therefore, many Ta5+-based oxides exhibit high photocatalytic performance for the water splitting reaction, compared with other oxides that have d0 electronic configuration.
Among the tantalates, NaTaO3 should be noted as the most active photocatalyst for water splitting. While NiO-loaded NaTaO3 also has highly efficient performance,26,28 La(2%)-doped NaTaO3 with a NiO co-catalyst exhibits remarkable performance for the cleavage of water: the apparent quantum yield reaches 56%, although the photocatalyst functions under UV-light irradiation.30,93 The activity is stable for more than 400 h under irradiation of light from a 400 W high-pressure mercury lamp. The evolution of H2 and O2 as bubbles can be observed when the photocatalyst is irradiated with UV from a 200 W Xe-Hg lamp, as shown in Fig. 7.5 Only light, water and photocatalyst powder are present in the system. It is amazing that the reduction and oxidation of water, completely opposite reactions, simultaneously proceed on the same surface of a nanoparticle. ATaO3 (A: Li, Na, and K) have similar perovskite-like structures consisting of corner-sharing TaO6 octahedra, as shown in Fig. 8.5,28 However, NaTaO3 has much higher performance than LiTaO3 and KTaO3, which suggests that the photocatalytic activities of ATaO3 depend largely on the A-site cation in the perovskite-like structure. The bond angles of Ta–O–Ta are 143° (LiTaO3), 163° (NaTaO3) and 180° (KTaO3) in octahedral coordination. Wiegel and co-workers have reported the relationship between crystal structures and energy delocalization for ATaO3 alkali tantalates.110 As the bond angle approaches 180°, excited energy or electron-hole pairs in the crystal migrate more easily and the band gap becomes narrower. Therefore, the order of the delocalization of excited electrons or electron-hole pairs is LiTaO3 < NaTaO3 < KTaO3, while the order of the band gap is reversed. The degree of localization affects step (2) in Fig. 2, as seen for Na2Ti6O1320,60–62 and BaTi4O921,62–67 with tunnel structures. Thus, it is expected that the high activity of NaTaO3 is due to the suitable conduction band level consisting of Ta 5d and energy delocalization caused by the slight distortion of TaO6 connections.

Morphological characteristics also contribute to the highly photocatalytic activity in La(2%)-doped NaTaO3 with NiO co-catalyst. La-doped NaTaO3 has a smaller particle size (0.1–0.7 µm) than non-doped NaTaO3 crystals (2–3 µm). It is common that small particle photocatalysts exhibit low crystallinity, which results in low photocatalytic activity, due to an increase in electron-hole recombination reactions (step (2) in Fig. 2). However, the La-doped NaTaO3 particles are not only small, but also have high crystallinity. This is advantageous in terms of increasing the probability of reactions of photogenerated electrons and holes with water molecules, rather than recombination. Ordered nanosteps on the particle surface are also one of the reasons for the high activity of La-doped NaTaO3. H2 evolution sites at step edges are effectively separated from the O2 evolution sites at the groove of the nanostep structure. This separation of reaction sites is effective to avoid back reactions, especially for the water splitting reaction. Doping of Ca, Sr and Ba also provides the same effect as La doping for the formation of the characteristic morphology of NaTaO3 and improvement of the photocatalytic activity.111 Time-resolved infrared (IR) measurements reveal that La doping prolongs the lifetime of photogenerated electrons in the conduction band or the shallow trap level.111 The IR absorption is due to electrons photogenerated by band gap excitation at 266 nm. The increase in electron lifetime is also one of the factors for improvement of the photocatalytic ability. Thus, the notable high performance of La-doped NaTaO3 is also attributed to the morphological characteristics.


3.1.3 Other oxides with d0 electronic configuration. 
Since 2004, oxides containing W6+ or Ce4+ with d0 electronic configuration have also been reported to split water. PbWO4,112,113 RbWNbO6,114 RbWTaO6,114 Sr-doped CeO2,115 and BaCeO3116 function as photocatalysts for overall water splitting in UV light.

3.2 Oxides with d10 electronic configuration
The photocatalytic cleavage of water by oxides with d0 electronic configuration had mainly been studied since the discovery of the Honda-Fujishima effect. However, Inoue et al. reported that AIn2O4 (A: Ca, Sr), NaSbO3, and Sr2SnO4, oxides with d10 electronic configuration, also function as photocatalysts for overall water splitting in UV light.33 This overturned the conventional concepts and direction of study, and had a major impact on photocatalyst development, including visible-light driven photocatalysts mentioned in the following section. Although the lower levels of the conduction bands and top levels of the valence bands of oxide photocatalysts with d0 electronic configuration are usually composed of transition metal d0 and O 2p orbitals, respectively, oxide photocatalysts with d10 electronic configuration such as NaInO2,36,37 CaIn2O4,33,36,37,117 SrIn2O4,33,36,37,117,118 LaInO3,117 YxIn2−xO3,119 NaSbO3,33 CaSb2O6,38 Ca2Sb2O7,38 Sr2Sb2O7,38 Sr2SnO4,33 ZnGa2O4,120 Zn2GeO4,38 LiInGeO4,121 and Ga2O3122 are distinct from those of oxide photocatalysts with d0 electronic configuration. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the valence and conduction band edges of SrIn2O4 consist of O 2p orbitals and hybridized orbitals among the In 5s, In 5p and O 2p orbitals, respectively, as shown in Fig. 9.117 Photoexcited electrons in broad hybridized In 5s5p orbitals with large dispersion can be readily transferred to a RuO2 co-catalyst on the surface without recombination, permitting efficient overall water splitting.

3.3 Nitrides with d10 electronic configuration
Nitrides with d10 electronic configuration, such as Ge3N4,123–126 GaN127 and Mg-doped GaN,128,129 are a new series of photocatalysts available for the cleavage of water under UV-light irradiation. Ge3N4 (β-Ge3N4) exhibits the highest activity for the reaction among these nitrides. The photocatalytic activity of RuO2-loaded β-Ge3N4 is considerably decreased with each reaction run of 2 h, particularly in the initial period, as shown in Fig. 10. The H2/O2 production ratio throughout these reactions has a stoichiometric ratio of 2, within the experimental error. The total amount of H2 evolved over 24 h was 11.2 mmol, greater than the amount of catalyst (0.5 g, 1.8 mmol of β-Ge3N4), which clearly demonstrates that RuO2-loaded β-Ge3N4 functions as a photocatalyst for overall water splitting. It is estimated, from a comparison with the reported value for NaTaO3,28 that the quantum efficiency of water splitting on β-Ge3N4 at around 300 nm is ca. 9%. The electronic structure of β-Ge3N4 was investigated using plane wave density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Fig. 11 shows the energy band dispersion and density of states (DOS) for β-Ge3N4. The DOSs indicate that the top of the valence bands consist of N 2p orbitals, whereas the bottom of the conduction bands is composed of hybridized Ge 4s4p orbitals. The band structure indicates that charge transfer upon photoexcitation occurs from the N 2p orbitals to the hybridized Ge 4s4p orbitals. Oxidation of water to form O2 over existing metal-oxide photocatalysts occurs as a result of contributions from photoexcited holes in the valence bands consisting of O 2p orbitals. However, for the present catalyst, the N 2p orbitals in the valence band are also able to generate photoexcited holes, which can contribute to the photocatalytic oxidation of water. Because hybridized Ge 4s4p orbitals broadly expand, similar to In 5s5p orbitals in the SrIn2O4 oxide photocatalyst with d10 electronic configuration, photoexcited electrons in such broad hybridized orbitals with large dispersion can be readily transferred to the RuO2 co-catalyst on the surface without recombination, permitting efficient overall water splitting.

Transition metal-based (oxy)nitrides with d0 electronic configuration cannot themselves reduce H+ and oxidize H2O simultaneously (see below). The results for Ge3N4 and GaN indicate that broad hybridized sp orbitals with large dispersion in nitrides with d10 electronic configuration have suitable band structures for overall water splitting, resulting in GaN-ZnO and ZnGeN2-ZnO solid solution systems that are able to split water in visible light (see below).
4. Photocatalytic cleavage of water in visible light
4.1 Strategy
It is essential to utilize visible light, which represents a large portion of the available solar-energy, for efficient conversion of solar-energy into H2 by the photocatalytic cleavage of water. Photocatalyst that are able to split water under visible light irradiation must meet all of the following three requirements: (1) the conduction and valence band edges must be more negative than 0 V vs. NHE (pH = 0) and more positive than +1.23 V vs. NHE (pH = 0), as shown in Fig. 1, (2) band gap energy smaller than 3 eV, and (3) chemical and structural stability during the photocatalytic reaction. The previously discussed oxide photocatalysts are not active for the water splitting reaction in visible light, due to the O 2p-based valence band. Fig. 12 shows the relationship between the band structure of a semiconductor and the redox potentials for water splitting.5,130 The tops of the valence bands of oxide photocatalysts are usually composed of O 2 p orbitals, which are much more positive than the redox potential of water (+1.23 V vs. NHE (pH = 0)), as shown in Fig. 12, and are therefore located around +3 V. While this is favorable for the oxidation of water from a thermodynamic point of view, because of the large overpotential, the bottoms of the conduction bands of an oxide photocatalyst must have a more negative potential than 0 V to split water into H2 and O2, inevitably resulting in a wide band gap energy (≥3 eV (≤413 nm)), so that most of the visible light (≥400 nm) cannot be utilized. Although WO3 functions as a stable photocatalyst for O2 evolution under visible light in the presence of an appropriate electron acceptor, the bottom of the conduction band of the material is located at a more positive potential than the potential of water reduction. As a result, WO3 does not have the ability to reduce H+ to H2, some chalcogenide semiconductors, such as CdS, seem to have band structures suitable for the cleavage of water under visible light irradiation, but are not available for the reaction because they are not stable under the photocatalytic reaction conditions. As a result, these conventional materials cannot split water in visible light without the use of an external bias. There are five routes available for the cleavage of water, based on conduction and valence band design for visible light-driven photocatalytic systems: (1) introduction of electron donor levels into the band structures of oxide photocatalysts by doping, (2) formation of a valence band edge composed of orbitals that have more negative potential than O 2p orbitals, (3) formation of a solid solution, (4) construction of Z-scheme photocatalysis system developed by (1)–(3), and (5) construction of a photoelectrochemical cell consisting of visible light-driven thin film photocatalysts.

The electron donor level is created above the valence band by doping certain elements into conventional photocatalysts with wide band gaps, such as TiO2 and SrTiO3, which results in the formation of an energy gap that is smaller than the original band gap. Note that the band gap is distinguished from the energy gap. The energy gap is formed by the impurity level that does not form a complete band. In this case, while conventional photocatalysts with wide band gaps can adsorb visible light, such doped photocatalysts cannot independently decompose water into H2 and O2 in visible light. On the other hand, some metal cations and anions can contribute to valence band formation above the valence band consisting of O 2p orbitals. Making a solid solution is also a useful band design.
4.2 Doped-oxide photocatalysts with wide band gaps
Doping has often been attempted to prepare visible light-driven photocatalysts. The TiO2 photocatalyst is often employed as a host material for the doping, because the oxide has a relatively small band gap energy (ca. 3 eV) among the wide band gap oxide photocatalysts. Generally, the white TiO2 powder becomes colored when doped with transition metal cations, which drastically decreases the photocatalytic activity due to the formation of recombination centers between photogenerated electrons and holes, even under band gap excitation. However, the introduction of appropriate dopants into oxide photocatalysts using appropriate methods can form visible light-driven photocatalysts without a large decrease in activity.
Co-doping of Cr3+/Ta5+, Cr3+/Sb5+, Ni2+/Ta5+ and doping of Rh cations is effective for the sensitization of SrTiO3 to visible light.131–139 Such doped SrTiO3 powders with Pt co-catalysts exhibit photocatalytic activities for H2 evolution in an aqueous solution containing methanol as a sacrificial electron donor under visible light irradiation. Cr- or Fe-doped La2Ti2O7 and Rh-doped SrTiO3 or CaTiO3 also function as effective visible light-driven photocatalysts for the reduction of H+ to H2. On the other hand, TiO2 (rutile) co-doped with Cr3+/Sb5+, Rh3+/Sb5+ and Ni2+/Nb5+ oxidizes water to produce O2 in the presence of Ag+ as a sacrificial electron acceptor under visible light irradiation. In these doped photocatalysts, the dopants form electron donor levels in the band gap of host oxides with wide band gaps, resulting in visible light response. Replacement of Ti4+ in host oxide photocatalysts with Cr3+ or Ni2+ unbalances the charge, forming recombination centers. Co-doped metal cations such as Nb5+, Ta5+ and Sb5+ compensate the charge imbalance and suppress the formation of recombination centers. While these co-doped wide band gap photocatalysts can use visible light up to 500–600 nm, they cannot independently split water into H2 and O2. In this case, Z-scheme combinations of photocatalysts effective for the reduction and oxidation under visible light irradiation are available for visible light cleavage of water (see below).
4.3 Valence band-designed photocatalysts
The formation of a valence band edge composed of orbitals that have more negative potential than the O 2p orbital results in a visible light-driven photocatalyst. Domen and coworkers have been extensively studying a series of (oxy)nitride and oxysulfide photocatalysts, based on this strategy. The schematic band structures of the metal oxide NaTaO3 and (oxy)nitride BaTaO2N, both of which have the same perovskite structure, are shown in Fig. 13.3 The top of the valence band of NaTaO3 is composed of O 2p orbitals, and is therefore located at more positive potential than 3 V vs. NHE (pH = 0). This causes the wide band gap to be unable to absorb visible light. However, partial or complete replacement of O atoms with N atoms in the metal oxide would form the top of valence band consisting of N 2p orbitals, as shown in the schematic band structure of BaTaO2N in Fig. 13. The N 2p-based valence band edge is expected to have a more negative potential than that of O 2p orbitals in metal oxides, because N 2p orbitals have more negative potential than O 2p orbitals. Fig. 14 shows the band structure of BaTaO2N calculated by density functional theory (DFT).3 As expected, the top of the valance band consists of hybridized N 2p and O 2p orbitals, whereas the bottom of the conduction band is mainly composed of empty Ta 5d orbitals. The top potential of the valance band for the (oxy)nitride is located at a higher potential energy than that for the corresponding oxide, due to the contribution of N 2p orbitals, reducing the band gap energy by <3 eV. This is supported by the results of Ta5+ (oxy)nitrides with d0 electronic configuration.140 Part of the O atoms in Ta2O5, a group 5 metal oxide photocatalyst with d0 electronic configuration, are replaced with N atoms in the presence of NH3 at approximately 1023 K, forming yellow tantalum oxynitride, TaON. More severe nitridation of Ta2O5 (excess NH3 at 1123 K) results in the formation of red tantalum nitride, Ta3N5. The band structures of Ta2O5, TaON, and Ta3N5, as determined by electrochemical and ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, are depicted schematically in Fig. 15. Although Ta2O5 functions as a photocatalyst for the cleavage of water, the top of the valence band based on the O 2p orbitals is located at a more positive potential than 3 V vs. NHE (pH = 0), which causes the wide band gap. In the case of TaON, the valence band edge by hybridized O 2p and N 2p orbitals has a higher energy than that based on only O 2p orbitals. In the case of Ta3N5, the top of the valence band is composed of only N 2p orbitals and has a more negative potential than that of TaON. There is no significant difference in the bottom potential of the conduction band between Ta2O5, TaON, and Ta3N5, which means that the introduction of N atoms into Ta2O5 increases the valence band edge without any significant change to the Ta 5d-based conduction band edge. Fig. 16 shows UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of Ta2O5, TaON, and Ta3N5.140 The increase in N atoms causes a drastic red shift; the band gaps of Ta2O5, TaON, and Ta3N5 are estimated to be 3.9, 2.4 and 2.1 eV, respectively. Considering these band structures, TaON and Ta3N5 are expected to decompose water into H2 and O2 under visible light irradiation.

TaON,141 Ta3N5,142 LaTiO2N,143,144 Ca0.25La0.75TiO2.25N0.75,145 CaNbO2N,146 ATaO2N (A: Ca, Sr, Ba),147 LaTaON2,146 and Ln2Ti2S2O5 (Ln: Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and Er),148–150 (oxy)nitride and oxysulfide photocatalysts with d0 electronic configuration have been developed on the basis of this strategy. The (oxy)nitrides can be readily prepared by nitriding transition metal oxide precursors with d0 electronic configurations in the presence of NH3 and are small band gap photocatalysts (band gap energies of 1.9–2.4 eV) with band structures suitable for the cleavage of water in visible light; the conduction band edges based on empty transition metal d orbitals are more negative than 0 V vs. NHE (pH = 0) and the valence band edges composed of N 2p orbitals or hybridized N 2p and O 2p orbitals are more positive than +1.23 V vs. NHE. Ln2Ti2S2O5 (Ln: Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and Er) oxysulfides can be obtained by heating a mixture of the corresponding precursors under vacuum or by sulfurization of the corresponding metal oxide powders using H2S gas.149 DFT calculations indicate that the S 3p atomic orbitals constitute the upper part of the valence band of Sm2Ti2S2O5 (band gap: 2.1 eV) and make a significant contribution to lowering the band gap energy from that of the corresponding metal oxide (Sm2Ti2O7 band gap: 3 eV). As expected from the band structures, all these (oxy)nitrides and oxysulfides can reduce H+ to H2 under visible light irradiation in the presence of appropriate sacrificial electron donors, such as methanol. TaON, Ta3N5, LaTiO2N, Ca0.25La0.75TiO2.25N0.75, CaNbO2N and Ln2Ti2S2O5 oxidize water to produce O2 in visible light in the presence of Ag+ as a sacrificial electron acceptor, which suggests that these materials satisfy the requirements for visible light cleavage of water with respect to the band structure and reactivity. Among this group, TaON exhibits remarkable performance for the oxidation of water, and the quantum efficiency reaches 34%. It should be noted that Sm2Ti2S2O5 functions as a stable photocatalyst for water oxidation to produce O2. Metal sulfides such as CdS are not suitable for use as photocatalysts for water oxidation, due to the inherent instability of these materials in the reaction via the photogeneration of holes. It has also been confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) that the decomposition of Sm2Ti2S2O5 in the bulk and at the surface, in particular the oxidation of S2− species, does not occur during water photooxidation, even though the valence band partially consists of S 3p atomic orbitals. Sm2Ti2S2O5 has a Ruddlesden-Popper layered perovskite structure, in which the layers are composed of S-(TiO2)-O-(TiO2)-S double octahedra. The formation of TiSO5 octahedra hybridizes S 3p and O 2p atomic orbitals constituting the valence band. It is likely that the hybridized S 3p and O 2p atomic orbitals are more stable than pure S 3p atomic orbitals. Although (oxy)nitride and oxysulfide photocatalysts with d0 electronic configurations satisfy such requirements for the cleavage of water, they cannot independently decompose water into H2 and O2; therefore, they are not available for the reaction without an external device, such as the Z-scheme (see below).151
Metal oxides based on Pb2+,152,153 Bi3+,154,155 Ag+,156 or Sn2+,157 exhibit visible-light photocatalytic activity due to the presence of s electrons and have also been developed on the basis of valence band design. Overall water splitting has yet to be achieved using these metal oxide photocatalysts, as for the (oxy)nitrides. Some have been successfully applied to the Z-scheme water splitting system, which mimics photosynthesis in green plants and involves a two-step photoexcitation.158–160
4.4 Solid solution system
GaN-ZnO161–170 and ZnGeN2-ZnO171 photocatalysts that independently split water under visible light irradiation have been developed, not only on the basis of oxynitride valence band design, but also on the basis of their solid solutions. Because both GaN and ZnO have wurtzite structures with similar lattice parameters,172,173 a solid solution can be formed between the two. GaN and ZnO have large band gap energies over 3 eV, which implies that the band gap of the solid solution should exceed 3 eV. However, for II–VI semiconductors, it has been identified that p-d repulsion (e.g., O 2p-Zn 3d) shifts the valence band maximum upward without affecting the conduction band minimum.174 By this analogy, p-d repulsion in the GaN-ZnO solid solution (i.e., N 2p-Zn 3d repulsion) may cause the top of the valence band formed by the N 2p atomic orbitals to reach a higher potential energy, which would result in a narrower band gap for GaN. The GaN-ZnO solid solution (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx) is typically synthesized by nitriding a mixture of Ga2O3 and ZnO. Fig. 17A shows powder XRD patterns of GaN-ZnO samples with different compositions, along with GaN and ZnO data for comparison. All samples exhibit single-phase diffraction patterns indicative of the wurtzite structure similar to the GaN and ZnO precursors. The position of the d(100) diffraction peak is shifted to lower 2θ angle with increasing Zn and O concentration. Fig. 17B shows UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra for several GaN-ZnO samples. GaN (reference) prepared from elemental Ga has a long tail in the visible region, which is considered to be attributable to remnant elemental Ga. The absorption edge shifts to longer wavelengths with increasing Zn and O content. The samples have band gaps smaller than those of the pure GaN and ZnO materials and that for the sample with x = 0.13 is estimated to be approximately 2.58 eV, based on the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrum. DFT calculations indicate that the bottom of the conduction band for GaN:ZnO is mainly composed of Ga 4s and 4p orbitals, while the top of the valence band consists of N 2p orbitals followed by Zn 3d orbitals. The presence of Zn 3d and N 2p electrons in the upper valence band provides p-d repulsion for the valence band maximum, which results in narrowing of the band gap.134 The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared GaN:ZnO for overall water splitting was negligible; however, the modification of GaN:ZnO with RuO2 results in clearly observable H2 and O2 evolution. This modification involves the deposition of RuO2 nanoparticles on the surface of the GaN:ZnO to provide H2 evolution sites. Fig. 18A shows the time course of H2 and O2 evolution under irradiation from a high-pressure mercury lamp (450 W) via a Pyrex glass tube (λ > 300 nm). H2 and O2 are steadily and stoichiometrically evolved without evolution of N2. Stoichiometric H2 and O2 evolution was again confirmed after filtering the UV light by filling the tube with NaNO2 solution, so that only visible light (λ > 400 nm) passed, as shown in Fig. 18B. It is considered that in this experiment, the emission of the high-pressure mercury lamp at 436 nm mainly contributes to the reaction. It was also confirmed that by using a Xe lamp (300 W) irradiation, the GaN:ZnO photocatalyst was active at wavelengths as long as 460 nm. The average apparent quantum efficiency in the range of 300–480 nm was calculated to be 0.14% using a Si photodiode. It is known that O2 evolution occurs over ZnO when employed as a photoanode for water oxidation in a photoelectrochemical cell, and that the ZnO degrades as a result. In contrast, such degradation does not occur in the GaN:ZnO system. The photocatalytic activity of a given material is dependent on the co-catalyst, which plays the essential role of inducing the photogeneration of carriers, provides catalytic gas evolution sites, and reduces the activation energy required for gas evolution. A range of transition-metal oxides have been examined as co-catalysts for the promotion of the overall water splitting reaction using (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx), all of which are inactive for water formation from H2 and O2 and are thus well suited for overall water splitting. The co-catalysts are loaded by impregnation with the transition-metal precursors followed by calcination in air. Ni, Ru, Rh, Ir, and Pt oxides are found to be effective for the promotion of overall water splitting by (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx) under UV irradiation. The activity of (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx) modified with Rh oxide as a co-catalyst is further enhanced by co-loading with Cr oxide. This can be attributed to the formation of (Rh2−yCryO3) nanoparticles (10–30 nm) that promote the reduction of H+ to H2.

The ZnGeN2-ZnO solid solution photocatalyst,171 (Zn1+xGe)(N2Ox), was developed by a similar strategy to that employed for (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx), and also functions as a stable visible light-driven photocatalyst for the cleavage of water. ZnGeN2 forms a hexagonal monoclinic phase with similar lattice parameters to ZnO, constituting a hexagonal wurtzite structure. While both ZnGeN2 and ZnO are wide gap semiconductors with band gaps larger than 3 eV, the band gap energy for the solid solution ((Zn1.44Ge)(N2.08O0.38)) is 2.7 eV, due to p-d repulsion between Zn 3d and N 2p + O 2p electrons in the upper part of the valence bands. Although such solid solution photocatalysts using rare elements may not result in practical solar-energy conversion, they could provide a promising new route to visible light driven photocatalysts for overall water splitting.
4.5 Quasi-Z-scheme construction
Under visible light irradiation, one photocatalyst can only reduce H+ to H2, and the other can only oxidize water to produce O2. However, both photocatalysts cannot individually function as photocatalysts for the cleavage of water using visible light. In such a case, it may be effective for overall water splitting by such photocatalysts to construct a so-called Z-scheme. The Z-scheme mimics the photosynthesis process in chloroplasts, solar-energy conversion by plants, and consists of photosystems I and II. In P680 (primary pigment) of photosystem II under visible light irradiation, water is oxidized to produce O2, and electrons are excited to a higher-energy level in the pigment. This energy is used to reduce a chain of electron acceptors that have subsequently lowered redox potentials to synthesize ATP. This chain of electron acceptors is known as an electron transport chain. When this chain reaches photosystem I, an electron is again excited in P700, the photosystem I pigment, in visible light, which creates a high redox- potential. NADP+ is reduced to NADPH by the excited electrons. The electron transport chain of photosynthesis is often schematically illustrated as a diagram called the Z-scheme, because the redox diagram from P680 to P700 resembles the letter Z. Fig. 19 shows the schematic electron transport in a Z-scheme composed of 2 photocatalysts and a redox couple electrolyte. The O2 evolution photocatalyst that cannot reduce H+ oxidizes water to produce O2 in visible light. Excited electrons in the photocatalyst cannot reduce H+, but oxidize the electrolyte. Under light irradiation, the H2 evolution photocatalyst generates holes that oxidize the electrolyte and excited electrons reduce H+ to H2. While this electron transport chain resembles a Z-scheme at first inspection, it should be distinguished from the Z-scheme. In the photosynthetic Z-scheme, ATP is successively synthesized in the electron transport chain from photosystem II to photosystem I, resulting in high solar-energy conversion. The redox reaction of the electrolyte is only repeated for electron transfer from the O2 evolution catalyst to the H2 evolution catalyst in the quasi-Z-scheme.

Fe ion-WO3175, Pt/TiO2 (anatase)–TiO2 (rutile)–IO3−/I−160,176 and Pt/TiO2(anatase)–Pt/WO3–IO3−/I−160 have been reported as Z-scheme systems based on inorganic photocatalysts that decompose water into H2 and O2 under UV irradiation, because Fe ions and TiO2 are not active as photocatalysts in visible light, but only respond to UV. Abe et al. and Sayama et al. successfully achieved visible light overall water splitting using a Z-scheme system151,175,177 designed by combining Pt/doped-SrTiO3 by Kudo et al.133 and Pt/WO3. Oxynitride photocatalysts TaON, CaTa2O2N and BaTa2O2N can be used as H2 evolution photocatalysts with Pt/WO3 as the O2 evolution photocatalyst.151,178 These photocatalyst systems respond to light with wavelength of approximately 450 nm, due to limitations of the WO3 band gap. The Pt/TaON-RuO2/TaON system is a unique combination and is active at up to 500 nm.179 A Z-scheme system consisting of Pt/Rh-doped SrTiO3 and BiVO4 or Bi2MoO6 is also active in the presence of the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple with light of wavelength up to 520 nm.159
4.6 Photoelectrochemical water splitting
Photocatalytic water splitting under visible light irradiation has been successfully achieved using powdered photocatalytic systems. However, powdered photocatalysts always produce a gas mixture of H2 and O2 during the splitting reaction, thus requiring a separation process for the gas mixture before the H2 can be effectively utilized. The separate evolution of H2 and O2 from water is strongly desired to obtain pure H2 gas. One possible way to overcome this problem is to use a photoelectrochemical cell consisting of a thin film photocatalyst. Fe2O3 and WO3 photoanodes deposited onto conducting glass substrates were employed for the photoelectrochemical splitting of water. These materials provide a potential means to capture a relatively significant portion of the available solar light, due to their lower band-gap energies (2.2 eV for Fe2O3 and 2.5 eV for WO3). Relatively high incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCE = ca. 25%) for the photoelectrochemical water decomposition under visible light were reported using nanocrystalline Fe2O3 electrodes.180–182 The photoelectrochemical characteristics of Fe2O3 photoanodes are typically found to have a marked dependence upon the anode preparation conditions and the nature of dopant incorporated into the host lattice.181–184 In particular, Si-doped nanostructured Fe2O3 photoanodes were shown to exhibit significant IPCEs (over 40%) for oxygen evolution in the visible spectral range.183,184 A nanocrystalline WO3 film on a conducting glass electrode also provides excellent IPCEs (over 75%) for photoelectrochemical water decomposition under visible light (λ = 400–410 nm).185,186 The nanocrystalline WO3 film was prepared by spreading a colloidal solution of WO3 on the conducting glass and then sintering it. Porous thin films have an advantage in that the diffusion length of the valence band holes formed by the bandgap photo-excitation is short, because the electrolyte solution can penetrate into the pores within the entire nanocrystalline semiconductor film. The solar energy conversion efficiency of the nanocrystalline WO3 film in the presence of an external applied potential was calculated to be 3.6%,187 although H2 and O2 gas evolution was not reported. Khan et al. reported in 2002 that the controlled combustion of Ti metal in a natural gas flame could produce carbon-doped TiO2.188 Carbon-doped TiO2 material that can absorb visible light photoelectrochemically split water with a high photoconversion efficiency of 8.35% under Xe lamp illumination.188–191
Anpo and co-workers succeeded in the separate evolution of H2 and O2 using a two-compartment cell (Fig. 20) under visible light irradiation using a visible light-responsive TiO2 thin film photocatalyst (Vis-TiO2) prepared by RF-magnetron sputtering deposition.192–194 The O/Ti ratio in the Vis-TiO2 thin film deviates from the stoichiometric ratio. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) investigations revealed that the concentration of O2− ions in the Vis-TiO2 film gradually decrease from the top surface (O/Ti ratio of 2.00 ± 0.01) to the bulk interior (O/Ti ratio of 1.93 ± 0.01). The IPCE of the Vis-TiO2 film for the photo-oxidation of water from a 0.1 M HClO4 aqueous solution at 1.0 V (vs. SCE) was found to be ca. 40% at 360 nm and 5.6% at 420 nm. Furthermore, Vis-TiO2 thin films treated with HF solution exhibit significant enhancement of photoelectrochemical performance, not only under UV, but also under visible light irradiation when compared to untreated Vis-TiO2. The stoichiometric and separate evolution of H2 and O2 has been achieved using a two-compartment cell (Fig. 20) under solar light. The solar energy conversion efficiency was estimated to be ca. 0.3% in the presence of a chemical bias (0.826 V).195 Sayama et al. reported that a nanocrystalline BiVO4 film electrode on conducting glass had excellent efficiency (IPCE = 29% at 420 nm) for the decomposition of water under visible light.196 Under visible-light irradiation, H2 and O2 were evolved in a stoichiometric ratio (H2/O2 = 2) from an aqueous solution of Na2SO4 under an external bias. When the surface of the BiVO4 electrode was treated with an aqueous AgNO3 solution, the photocurrent and stability of the electrode were significantly improved,197 and a maximum IPCE of 44% was attained at 420 nm. This value is the highest among the mixed-oxide semiconductor electrodes under visible light irradiation. The solar energy conversion efficiency in the presence of an external applied potential was estimated to be ca. 0.2%. These photoelectrochemical systems are attractive with respect to the separate evolution of H2 and O2, although an additional bias is required to split water.

5. Perspective
The heterogeneous photocatalytic cleavage of water has been studied over a quarter of a century since the discovery of the Honda-Fujishima effect. Only a few photocatalysts were able to split water under UV light irradiation prior to the 21st century. It is currently well known that there are many heterogeneous catalysts available for the cleavage of water in UV light. After reports of the InTaO4 system in 2001,198,199 other photocatalyst systems available for overall water splitting under visible light have been reported one after another as mentioned above. The study of photocatalytic overall water splitting over the past 40 years has constructed a basis for further developments in this field that will result in evaluation of systems of practical value in the future. However, two challenges remain for practical H2 production from water by using visible light-driven photocatalysts: (1) the construction of highly efficient photocatalysts that can be readily prepared from abundant and inexpensive starting materials, and (2) the construction of practical H2 production systems. While several systems based on heterogeneous photocatalysts are available for the reaction in visible light, the wavelength of solar light that these systems can utilize is shorter than those of solar cells. In most of the papers introduced in this feature article, the solar-energy conversion efficiency (η) for the system is not shown, which indicates that this field of study has remained in the fundamental stage. Various approaches, including impurity doping, valence band design, solid solution design and Z-scheme systems could be used to overcome the first challenge.
The design of practical systems is also very relevant. Both solar cells and water electrolysis are considered to be established technologies. However, H2 production by the electrolysis of water using a solar cell has yet to be established as a commercial process comparable with the decomposition of fossil fuels. There are many technological problems that must still be overcome in the photocatalytic cleavage of water, such as the design and materials for large-scale reactors, supply of water and environmentally benign separation of O2 from explosive H2 and O2 mixtures. Only extensive research and development in various fields will contribute to overcome such problems, including the development of highly efficient photocatalysts. Hydrogen production based on highly active photocatalyst systems would be available as a hydrogen supply system not only for fuel cells and the production of industrially important chemicals, but also for the production of new energy sources such as ammonia that can be combusted in alkali fuel cells without noble metal catalysts.
