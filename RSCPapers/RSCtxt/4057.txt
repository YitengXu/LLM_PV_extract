    , Accepted 7th March 2019First published on 8th March 2019AbstractSolar thermal water evaporation is a clean, sustainable, and energy-saving approach to fresh water generation compared with traditional methods. Electroplated coating, such as nickel black, have been commercialized in solar water heaters. Inspired by this, we developed a nanostructured Ni–NiOx/Ni foam (NF) composed of Ni metal nanoparticles and NiOx with defects. The Ni–NiOx/NF exhibited high solar absorbance due to the plasmonic effect of metal Ni nanoparticles and defects. Ni–NiOx/NF also showed a low thermal conductivity, which prevented the loss of thermal energy and thermal transfer, which will be beneficial to the generation of localized high temperatures. The as-prepared Ni–NiOx/NF can self-float on the water surface without any other materials owing to a high contact angle. The average water evaporation rate of the as-prepared Ni–NiOx/NF reached 1.41 kg m−2 h−1 and the average solar conversion efficiency was about 94%. The best sample exhibited a water evaporation rate of 1.45 kg m−2 h−1 and 96% solar conversion efficiency. This report highlights potential semiconductor materials as highly efficient solar water evaporation materials.
Introduction
Solar energy is a promising sustainable clean energy to support various human activities. Converting solar energy into energy sources that can be directly applied in daily life is a great opportunity and challenge. For example, solar cells convert solar energy into power, while solar water heaters convert solar energy into thermal energy. Solar steam generation is an increasingly popular technique for seawater desalination, and water purification has attracted tremendous attention.1,2 To efficiently convert solar energy to thermal energy, various photothermal materials have been employed as light absorbers to increase absorptance. Plasmonic metal nanostructures3–12 and carbonaceous materials,13,14 including graphene,15–23 carbon nanotubes,24,25 carbonized biomass,26–28 conductive polymers,29 and semiconductors with narrow band gap,30–33 have been developed as broadband solar absorption materials. Meanwhile, 2D and 3D porous nanostructures have been used as matrixes for efficient water transportation to construct high-performance solar water evaporation devices.13,14,28,34 Coating the light absorber on a porous matrix is a complicated process. Therefore, developing low-cost and scalable materials to achieve optimal light absorption, thermal management, and water transportation is highly challenging.
Generally, photothermal materials must have the following properties:30 (i) a wide absorption capability covering the full solar spectrum; (ii) a low emissivity, ensuring the largest photo-to-heat conversion efficiency, and (iii) a lower thermal conductivity than surrounding media to achieve localized high temperatures. In commercial solar-to-heat systems, electroplated coating, such as nickel black and chrome black, have commonly been employed as highly efficient light-absorbing materials owing to their high solar absorptance. Nickel-based nanomaterials are potential low-cost light-absorbing materials. Liu and coworkers showed that plasmonic Ni nanochains in Al2O3 or SiOx as a selective solar thermal absorber have a high solar absorptance (>90%) and low thermal emittance loss (<10%).35,36 Nickel has better chemical stability than Al or Fe. Recently, Ni-based nanomaterials have been extensively explored as electrocatalysts. Although nickel black is a commercialized light-adsorbing material used in solar water heaters, it has rarely been investigated as a solar thermal material for water evaporation. Herein, we developed a nanostructured Ni–NiOx composite on Ni foam (Ni–NiOx/NF) through a solution process. This composite exhibited high light absorptance and low thermal conductivity. This material can also self-float on the water surface owing to its surface nanostructure, and can therefore be fabricated as a self-floating photothermal device for water desalination and purification. The Ni–NiOx/NF exhibited a high photothermal conversion efficiency of ∼94% due to the plasmonic effect of Ni metal particles and the rich defects of NiOx, resulting in broad light absorbance. Thermal conductivity prevented the loss of thermal energy from the generation site. The localized high temperature promoted the water evaporation rate, leading to a high photothermal conversion efficiency.
Experimental
Materials
Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Corporation. Ni foam (NF) with a pore size of 110 PPI, surface density of 250 g m−2, and thickness of 1 mm was purchased from Suzhou Christie's Foam Metal Co., Ltd. All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification.
Synthesis of Ni–NiOx/NF
NF was washed with diluted hydrochloric acid, ethanol, and deionized water several times to ensure that the NF surface was clean. First, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (1.45 g, 5 mmol), HMT (1.40 g, 10 mmol), and water (40 mL) were added into a beaker, and then stirred well to give a uniform transparent solution. The above solution and NF were transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, heated at 100 °C for 10 h, and allowed to cool. The obtained NF was washed with water several times and dried at 60 °C in the oven. Subsequently, the treated NF was calcined in air at different temperatures (300–550 °C) for different times (1–3 h) to obtain NiO/NF. Finally, the obtained NiO/NF was reduced using different amounts of hydrazine hydrate (0.05–0.50 mL) for different periods (0.5–5.5 h) to afford Ni–NiOx/NF.
Characterization
The crystal structures of the samples were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) as the incident beam at 40 kV and 40 mA. The sample morphologies were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20) operated at 200 kV and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL S-4800) operated at 5 kV. Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra were measured using a Hitachi U-4150 spectrometer with an integrating sphere accessor, using BaSO4 as the reference material. XPS measurements were conducted on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250xi multifunctional X-ray spectrometer. Thermal conductivity was calculated using the following formula: thermal conductivity = thermal diffusion coefficient × density × specific heat. The thermal diffusivity was measured using a laser thermal conductivity meter (TA company DXF500) and the specific heat was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC; Q2000). Contact angles were measured using a surface contact angle analyzer (TP50, Data-Physics) at room temperature. The real-time sample temperatures were measured using an IR thermograph (Ou PuShi PI450) during the experiment, and a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Trusttech Co. Ltd, China) was used to simulate the full spectrum of solar light. The ion content of seawater and photothermal evaporated water were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).
Solar evaporation performance measurement

Water evaporation. 
Water was placed in a beaker (internal diameter, 30 mm; depth, 4.5 cm) and subjected to simulated solar irradiation using a 300 W Xe lamp with an AM 1.5 filter, with the light intensity kept at 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun), calibrated using an optical power meter (FZ-A131806, Beijing Normal University Photoelectric Instrument Co., Beijing, China). A piece of Ni–NiOx/NF (2 cm × 2 cm) applied for photothermal evaporation was kept within a circular area with a diameter of 30 mm. This membrane sample was placed on the water surface in the beaker and exposed to simulated solar light vertically from above. The beaker was placed on an electronic analytical balance connected to a computer for real-time monitoring of water loss due to evaporation over certain time intervals. The solar energy to thermal water evaporation conversion efficiency (η) of the NiNiOx/NF as estimated using eqn (1)–(3).34,37–41 (1) He = 1.91846 × 106[T/(T − 33.91)]2(2) Q = c(T − T1)(3)where ν is the evaporation rate of water, He is the total enthalpy required for water to transition from liquid to vapor phase, T is the evaporation temperature, and Q is the sensible heat of water of unit mass, c is the specific heat capacity of water (4.2 J g K−1), T1 is the initial water temperature, and Ein (kJ m−2 h−1) is the energy input of the incident light.16,23,41,42 All test data were obtained at a room temperature of 26 ± 1.0 °C and a relative humidity of 45–55%. Seawater evaporation rate measurements were conducted at a room temperature of 15–18 °C and a relative humidity of 18–20%. The evaporation rate depended on environmental conditions, including temperature and humidity.


Solar desalination. 
The solar desalination experiment was implemented using a homemade solar seawater desalination system (Fig. S1†). The main parts of the system were a transparent window, condensation cover, and evaporation seat, among others. The assembly height of the device was about 17 cm and the inner cavity height was about 13 cm. Seawater was poured into the chassis, and the Ni–NiOx/NF membrane (diameter, 5.6 cm) was placed on the seawater surface under a 300 W Xe lamp with an AM 1.5 filter and light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun) to produce steam. The steam was condensed to form water droplets, which were drawn into the beaker by gravity to realize the collection and characterization of purified water.

Results and discussion
The synthetic route is shown in Fig. 1a. In a typical experiment, Ni(OH)2 nanosheets were grown on a commercial Ni foam through a hydrothermal route using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and HMT as starting materials. The Ni(OH)2/NF was then transferred onto NiO/NF nanosheets by high-temperature calcination. To fabricate Ni–NiOx composites on the Ni foam, the NiO nanosheets were reduced with hydrazine. Fig. 1b–e show scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for the original Ni foam, Ni(OH)2 nanosheets, NiO nanosheets, and Ni–NiOx composite on Ni foam. Ni foam provided a porous substrate for Ni(OH)2, which grew vertically on the Ni foam surface. The nanosheets were a few nanometers thick. After calcination at 400 °C for 1 h, the Ni(OH)2/NF nanosheets were converted into NiO/NF. The nanosheets and nanoparticle morphologies of the reduced Ni–NiOx/NF sample were observed. Fig. 1f shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the above four samples. The Ni foam exhibited typical metal Ni diffraction peaks at 44.9°, 51.0°, and 76.4°, corresponding to (111), (200), and (220) planes of Ni (JCPDS card no. 04-0850). After the hydrothermal reaction, the sample color turned light green, indicating the formation of Ni(OH)2. There was also a weak diffraction peak at 12.1°, which was assigned as the (003) diffraction peak of Ni(OH)2 (Fig. S2†). After calcination, a new set of diffraction peaks at 37.4°, 43.3°, and 63.0° appeared, which were assigned to NiO (JCPDS card no. 04-0835), implying that Ni(OH)2 had been converted into NiO. With increasing calcination temperature from 300 to 500 °C, the Ni(OH)2 diffraction peak intensity increased (Fig. S3†). In the final step, the relative intensity of the NiO diffraction peaks decreased compared with those of the NiO sample, indicating that NiO was partially reduced (Fig. S3†). Fig. S5,†1g and h show the high-resolution (HR) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Ni foam, Ni(OH)2, NiO, and Ni/NiOx composites, which were recorded to determine the Ni valence states in the samples. The four peak groups at 853–855, 860–862, 870–873, and 877–880 eV were assigned as Ni 2p3/2, Ni 2p3/2 satellite, Ni 2p1/2, and Ni 2p1/2 satellite peaks, respectively. Each peak was divided into two Lorentz-type peaks for Ni(0) and Ni(II). Ni(II) signals were detected in the Ni foam because it contained a thin layer of oxides on the surface. When Ni(OH)2 nanosheets were grown on the Ni foam, a new signal at 854.6 eV was observed, which was assigned as the Ni(II) 2p3/2 peak of Ni(OH)2. This signal disappeared and a weak Ni(0) peak appeared in the calcined NiO sample (Fig. 1g). Fig. 1h clearly shows that the fraction of Ni(0) 2p3/2 increased compared with the Ni(II) signal owing to NiO being partially reduced under treatment with hydrazine, which indicated that metal Ni formed in this step. The Ni(II) peak shifted toward a low binding energy, implying that oxygen vacancies might be generated during the reduction process.

Fig. S6 and S7† show transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and HRTEM images of Ni(OH)2 and NiO, which confirmed the formation and preservation of Ni(OH)2 and NiO nanosheets in the growth and calcined steps. Fig. 2 shows the TEM and HR-TEM images of the Ni/NiOx sample. Two types of morphologies are shown in Fig. 2a, in agreement with the SEM image results (Fig. 1e). The large particles were about 300 nm in diameter. The HR-TEM image (Fig. 2b) shows a lattice fringe space of 0.201 nm, attributed to metal Ni (111), indicating that the large particles were metal Ni nanoparticles. Fig. 2c shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the large particles, which exhibited a few diffraction rings corresponding to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) lattice spacings of metal Ni. Another nanosheet morphology was detected in the TEM images, with some dark nanoparticles were observed on the nanosheets (Fig. 2c). The HR-TEM images exhibited two lattice fringe spacings of 0.208 and 0.183 nm (Fig. 2d), which were assigned to the (200) of NiO and (200) of Ni, respectively. Similarly, the SAED pattern (Fig. 2e) of the nanosheets showed diffraction rings at 0.240, 0.21, 0.146, and 0.126 nm which were assigned to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) of NiO, respectively, confirming that the nanosheets were NiO. Based on these TEM and HR-TEM results, Ni nanoparticles were formed in the reduction steps.

To achieve a highly efficient photothermal material, the first requirement is a wide light adsorption capability covering the full solar spectrum range from 250 to 2500 nm. To determine the absorption capability, the absorbance and reflectance of the samples were measured. As shown in Fig. 3a, Ni foam as a skeleton exhibited absorbance in the UV light region and a long decay in the visible light and IR regions. The Ni(OH)2 nanosheets also showed low absorbance in the visible and IR regions. After calcination, the NiO nanosheets displayed better visible light and NIR absorbance. The absorbance decreased in the IR region (wavelength, >1500 nm). The Ni/NiOx composites showed excellent absorbance over the whole solar spectrum. Solar absorptance (αsol) is a measure of the ability of a matter to absorb solar radiation, and can be calculated using eqn (S1)† as the ratio of total absorbed solar radiation to incident radiation. Thermal emittance (εtherm) is another thermal energy loss, but as water evaporation was conducted well below 100 °C, thermal emittance was not considered in this case. According to Kirchhoff's law, at each wavelength, λ, the absorptance α(λ) is equal to 1 − R(λ) at thermal equilibrium (eqn (S2)†).35,43,44

(d) Contact angle of the Ni–NiOx/NF. 

Fig. 3b shows the reflectivity spectra of the samples with the solar spectrum. Based on eqn (S1) and (S2),† the solar absorptance αsol of the Ni–NiOx/NF was calculated and is shown in Table S1.† Ni–NiOx/NF exhibited a high solar light absorbance of ∼90%, making it a good photothermal candidate. The thermal conductivity of the samples was also calculated, as listed in Table S2.† Ni–NiOx/NF (Fig. 3c) exhibited quite low thermal conductivity (0.24 W m−1 K−1), which was about one-quarter that of Ni foam, indicating that Ni–NiOx had the lowest thermal transfer rate. This inhibited the thermal transfer process and helped generate a localized high temperature, which improved the overall efficiency of solar steam generation.17 Another advantage of Ni foam is that it can self-float on the water surface without treatment. Therefore, the contact angle was evaluated. The Ni foam exhibited a mild contact angle of 99°, which increased to 123° for Ni–NiOx/NF (Fig. 3d). Therefore, both materials can float on the water surface without any treatment. In contrast, both Ni(OH)2/NF and NiO/NF samples displayed super-hydrophilic behavior (Fig. S8†). When water was dropped on their surfaces, it rapidly infiltrated into the samples. Therefore, Ni(OH)2/NF and NiO/NF were unable to self-float on the water surface without the aid of a PVDF coating.

Fig. 4a shows the water temperature dependence on irradiation time under 1 sunlight. For the blank without sample, the water surface temperature increased from room temperature (RT, 26–27 °C) to 30 °C within a few minutes and increased slowly thereafter, reaching 32 °C after irradiation for 2 h. When Ni foam was placed on the water surface, it self-floated on the surface due to a contact angle of about 99°. The Ni foam absorbed the light and converted it into heat, resulting in the surface temperature increasing rapidly from RT to ∼36 °C within ∼2 min, reaching 38 °C after 5 min and, finally, 40 °C after irradiation for 2 h. When Ni(OH)2 or NiO nanosheets covered the Ni foam surface, the water surface temperature was slightly higher than when using the Ni foam alone owing to their improved absorptance. When the NiO nanosheets were converted into Ni–NiOx/NF composites, the temperature rapidly jumped to ∼38 °C within ∼10 s, and the balance temperature (46 °C) was reached after about 30 min. Finally, the temperature reached ∼48 °C after irradiation for 2 h. Fig. 4b–e and S9† show the infrared images of these samples before and after irradiation for 2 h. These clarified that the Ni–NiOx/NF sample afforded the highest temperature (47.9 °C) within 120 min and that the high-temperature region was concentrated at the water surface. The bulk water still remained at a relatively low temperature. Fig. 4f shows a side-view photograph of the water under light irradiation for 2 h, indicating that the high temperature was concentrated near the water surface.

Fig. 5a and Table S3† show the dependence of the water evaporation rate on the irradiation time for different samples under 1-sun simulated light (100 mW cm−2). Without light irradiation, the water evaporation rate was quite low (∼0.15 kg m−2 h−1), showing that water evaporates under ambient conditions at a very low rate. Light irradiation heats the water, resulting in the water evaporation rate increasing to 0.69 kg m−2 h−1. When the photothermal sample was placed on the water surface, the temperature of the water surface greatly increased, resulting in a higher water evaporation rate (1.41 kg m−2 h−1). The highest evaporation rate was 1.45 kg m−2 h−1. Based on the water evaporation rate, the photothermal conversion efficiency is shown in Fig. 5b. The average photothermal conversion efficiency was 88%, while the best conversion efficiency was 91%. Table S3† provides detailed information on the calculation of water evaporation rate and light conversion efficiency. In addition to the optimal samples in Fig. 5a, we optimized the preparation conditions (such as calcination time for NiO and NiO to Ni–NiOx/NF reduction conditions) to gain the best effects on photothermal conversion efficiency (shown in Fig. S10–S13†). SEM images (Fig. S14†) showed that the large Ni particles gradually increased and the nanosheet structure gradually disappeared with increasing reduction time, while the solar efficiency initially increased and then decreased with increasing reduction time. Solar thermal water evaporation materials are mainly divided into three categories: noble metal plasmonic materials, carbon-based materials, and narrow band-gap materials. The corresponding solar thermal conversion efficiencies range from 40% to 90% (Table S4†). Compared with previous reports, the Ni–NiOx/NF showed a relatively high water evaporation rate and solar thermal conversion efficiency. Therefore, Ni–NiOx/NF is a potential high-efficiency and low-cost solar thermal conversion material.

(c) Concentrations of primary ions (Na+, Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, and B3+) in seawater from the Bohai Sea before and after desalination. (d) Cycle performance of Ni–NiOx/NF. 
To test the practical application of our materials, seawater from the Bohai Sea was used as the water source. Fig. S15† shows the seawater evaporation rate as a function of irradiation time. The solar conversion efficiency was close to that of fresh water. Compared with seawater, the conductivity of the evaporated water dramatically decreased to 25 μS cm−1, which was slightly higher than that of 1 ppm NaCl solution (10 μS cm−1) or ultrapure water (5.2 μS cm−1). Fig. 5c shows the element content in the seawater and evaporated water, indicating that the Na+, K+ Mg2+, and Ca2+ concentrations decreased by about three orders of magnitude. The ion concentration was lower than the WHO and EPA standards. Fig. 5d shows the stability test of Ni–NiOx/NF. The water evaporation rate remained almost constant over 25 test cycles, indicating that Ni–NiOx/NF was stable during water evaporation.
To determine why Ni–NiOx/NF had the best photothermal effect, the structure–performance relationships of this material must be understood. SEM and TEM images showed that two types of Ni nanoparticles were present, the first type being a few nanometers in size and dispersed on the NiOx nanosheets and the second type being large Ni particles a few hundred nanometers in size. These Ni nanoparticles had a strong surface plasmonic effect, which promoted photothermal conversion.35,45 Furthermore, the Ni–NiOx/NF had the lowest thermal conductivity among the samples in this study, while Ni foam had the highest. From the temperature curve (Fig. 4a), the Ni foam reached the balance temperature within the shortest time (∼5 min). However, Ni–NiOx/NF took about 30 min to reach the balance temperature owing to its low thermal conductivity. This low thermal conductivity also resulted in a low thermal transfer rate, which further explained why Ni–NiOx/NF took a longer time to reach the balance temperature. This also increased the localized temperature, allowing the temperature to reach 48 °C when using the Ni–NiOx/NF sample, thus promoting a high water evaporation rate at a relatively high temperature. In summary, the nanostructured Ni–NiOx/NF composite possessed high light absorbance and low conductivity, which led to a high photothermal conversion efficiency and low thermal loss. This resulted in Ni–NiOx/NF exhibiting the best photothermal effect in this study.
Conclusions
We successfully fabricated nanostructured Ni–NiOx/NF materials for application to solar water evaporation. The surface of these nanostructured materials had a high contact angle, allowing them to self-float on the water surface. The Ni–NiOx/NF exhibited broad light absorption in the visible and IR regions due to the plasmonic resonance effect of Ni particles. The solar light absorbance reached ∼90%. In water evaporation, the Ni–NiOx/NF had a low thermal conductivity of 0.243 W m−1 K−1. Under 1-sun irradiation (100 mW cm−2), the water evaporation rate reached 1.41 kg m−2 h−1 and the photothermal conversion efficiency was ∼94%. The materials prepared herein also exhibited improved stability and water evaporation rates and efficiencies when applied to Bohai seawater. This work provides a potential method for fabricating low-cost photothermal water evaporation materials for fresh water production.
