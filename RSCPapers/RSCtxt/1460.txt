    , Accepted 24th July 2020First published on 28th July 2020AbstractIn the last decade, lead triiodide perovskite (APbI3) (A: organic cation) solar cells (PSCs) have been broadly studied due to their promising features related to the low cost, easy manufacturing process, and stability. Strategies to improve the device stability include the application of techniques such as compositional engineering of the cation of these halide perovskites, but it is still a complex task to find the right balance between the stability and power conversion efficiency of materials and complete devices. In this work, we performed a combined study of five samples of [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3 (5-AVA: ammonium valeric acid and MA: methylammonium) with x = 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.0, using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-VIS spectroscopy measurements in combination with periodic density functional theory (DFT) based calculations. Our samples showed an optical bandgap of 1.58 eV and the coexistence of the two phases as observed by XRD analyses. The theoretical results of the bandgaps for the no mixed phases (x = 1.0 and x = 0.0) show good agreement with the experiment, obtaining bandgap values overestimated by 0.18 eV and 0.33 eV, respectively. A direct relation between the number of 5-AVA ions in the samples and the stability of the phases was theoretically found and proved through the increment observed in the bandgap and the cohesive energy. We proposed a compositional strategy for perovskites [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3 with x values of at most 0.5, based on the small blue-shift and the low absorbance reduction of the spectrum curve, added to the small phase stabilization found.
Introduction
In the last decade, scientific research that concerns green power generation of electricity has experienced a growing demand for new materials and technologies to deal with global warming and become a real alternative to fossil fuels. In this context, the electricity produced by photovoltaic solar cells is an outstanding source of energy due to its abundance and eternal nature. The last biggest scientific breakthroughs in this area occurred in 2009, with the invention of perovskite solar cells (PSCs),1 with their power conversion efficiency improving in a few years from 3.8% to 25.2%.2–4 Other important benefits of the PSCs are their low cost compared with conventional solar cells, associated with inexpensive materials, easy manufacturing process and high stability reached using cross-linking additives5 or compositional engineering.6,7 The most typical and studied PSC is methylammonium lead trihalide, MAPbX3 (MA = methylammonium and X = Cl−, Br−, I−), with excellent optoelectronic properties associated with large light absorption coefficients, optimal band-gaps, and large carrier diffusion lengths.8–10 Despite the growing interest, the development of PSCs has not been free of major issues such as poor material stability under operational conditions11–15 and toxicity due to the use of lead as a metallic center, the latter has limited the deployment and commercialization of PSCs as a future PV technological solution.16 Different strategies have been proposed to circumvent these problems, for example in a recent publication,17 several potential substituents for the replacement of lead such as Sn,18 Ge,19 and Sb,20 among others, have been reviewed, reaching efficiencies of 8.4%, 3.2%, and 3.8%, respectively. On the other hand, the stability problems can be associated with intrinsic factors such as the crystalline structure and chemical stability, and also extrinsic factors such as moisture, UV radiation, and thermal stress.12,13,21–23 The correct combination of these two key aspects is necessary to reach new PSCs aligned with the spirit of green power generation. Moreover, in line with chemical stability, potential substituents of the organic part have also been addressed. The replacement of the cationic MA by different atoms or molecules has been intensely studied with favourable improvement in device stability, for example, formamidinium (FA), cesium (Cs) and 5-ammonium valeric acid (5-AVA) have been analysed.24,25 Han et al.26 made a significant contribution to the state of the art PSCs by proposing a hole-conductor-free perovskite based on a mixture of MA and 5-AVA iodide with lead(II) iodide. The results showed that the crystalline structure has fewer pore defects and improved TiO2 scaffold contact, resulting in a longer exciton lifetime with a higher quantum yield efficiency and high stability under air ambient conditions compared to MAPbI3. Later, Nazeeruddin et al.27 achieved a one-year stable perovskite solar cell using interface engineering precisely using the combination of MA and 5-AVA, confirming the appropriate use of 5-AVA as a substituent.28 In the latter work, the beneficial effect of applying two mesoporous oxide layers28,29 in combination with the use of 5-AVA dopants and the elimination of a hole transport layer was suggested as the reason behind the remarkable device stability. Relatively few computational investigations of the MA/5-AVA lead trihalide mixture have been performed30,31 and to the best of our knowledge, limited connection with the experimental results has been shown.
In this work, we present an experimental and theoretical combined study of the global and molecular effects on a systematic increase of 5-AVA concentration in the preparation of perovskite [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3 crystals. Moreover, from the theoretical point of view, we analyse the molecular and optical implications of the substitution of MA by 5-AVA ions using the framework of density functional theory (DFT) and the plane wave methods.
Experiments and calculation methods
Experimental details
The [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3 samples of five phases from x = 0 to 1, with intermediate values of 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75, were synthesized and analysed by XRD to study the crystalline quality and composition of the materials. Moreover, bandgap determination via UV-VIS measurements in the five phases was performed. For the preparation of the [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3 samples, PbI2, MAI and 5-AVA were dissolved in a 1:4 mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylformamide (DMF), with the respective variation of the molar ratio between 5-AVA and MAI. Glass/FTO substrates were cleaned with Hellmanex/distilled water/acetone/ethanol in sequence using an ultrasonic bath. Just before material deposition via spin-coating in a glovebox, the samples were plasma-etched to increase the wettability of the sample surface. After the dynamic spin coating, the samples were heated for 20 minutes at 100 °C and taken out of the glovebox to perform measurements. The UV-VIS spectra were measured on a Cary 4000 UV-VIS Spectrometer with a wavelength spectrum from 200 to 800 nm. To minimize systematic errors, a glass/FTO reference was measured and its baseline was subtracted from the data of the samples.
The XRD-analysis was performed with a 2-theta range from 5 to 60 degrees including a glass/FTO substrate as a reference.
Theoretical details
At low temperature, the crystallographic phase of perovskite MAPbI3 has orthorhombic symmetry, with the MA ion ordered in the unit cell as shown in Fig. 1. The well-defined position of MA ions in the crystallographic unit cell is useful to make the substitutions of these ions by 5-AVA ions and keep the dipole moment of the unit cell invariant. We use the crystalline structure reported by Baikie et al.32 as the starting point, where we apply a systematic substitution of MA ion coordinates by 5-AVA ions, using the same orientation of the native zwitterion. Following the experimental samples, a total of five different phases of [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3 was theoretically modelled, with x taking values of 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.0. We perform a constrained geometry optimization on these structures keeping all unit cell angles fixed to conserve the symmetry. All geometry optimization calculations were based on DFT,33 where the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)34 was used to represent the exchange and correlation energy of the electrons using the Quantum-Espresso code.35 Semi-empirical van der Waals corrections were considered by the use of Grimme's D3 correction.36 Moreover, the plane wave (PW) technique along with PAW37 pseudopotential was employed, using an energy cutoff of 400 Ry with a uniform Monkhorst–Pack38 scheme of a 7–5–7 k-point grid to sample the entire Brillouin zone. The convergence tolerance for the total energy and Hellmann–Feynman force during the structural relaxation was set to 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. For an easy identification of the calculation scheme, we denote this strategy of calculation as DFT-PW/PBE-D3.

On the other hand, accurate energy, band-structure, and DOS (density of states) were determined through a single point calculation in the previously optimized geometry using the ADF-BAND program.39,40 We study the scalar relativistic effects through the inclusion of the ZORA formalism in an all-electron (AE) calculation of the already mentioned properties using also the PBE-D3 functional with a triple-ζ basis set. We denote this strategy of calculation as DFT-AE/PBE-D3.
Results and discussion
Structural and UV-VIS characterization
The XRD analysis of the samples shows good agreement with the already published XRD-properties of the perovskite,41 as shown in Fig. 2. All peaks can be assigned either to the substrate (2θ = 26.4°), an excess of PbI2 (2θ = 12.6°), or the phase MAPbI3 (2θ = 14.8°, 20.1° and 24.5°).42 The presence of PbI2 is known to be beneficial for PSCs. Its passivation effect leads to the reduction of halide defect concentration (halide vacancies), resulting in longer carrier lifetime.43 However, it can also result in inhibited charge transport and an increase in the degradation of the halide perovskite layer (due to the photodecomposition of PbI2). To overcome this issue, the incorporation of organic additives or ligands, such as AVAi, helps to regulate the homogeneous distribution of PbI2 in the halide perovskite thin film and to improve thin film properties.44,45 Thus, an optimal amount of AVAi is incorporated within the halide perovskite. As seen in Fig. 3, the optimal concentration of AVAi in the samples is ∼x = 0.25 (for x in [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3), above this value, the excess of PbI2 is clearly observed by the increase of the PbI2 peak at 12.6°.42 This MAPbI3-XRD pattern is then compared with those of the other [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3 samples, as can be seen in Fig. 3. The very significant peaks for the 5-AVA containing samples at 5.8°, 7.8°, and 9.4°, attributed to the crystallographic planes of the formation of a 2D perovskite, are in good agreement with previously reported data,26,27 and can be assigned to 5-AVAPbI3.46 It has been previously suggested that 5-AVAi, MAI and PbI2 can form 2D Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) phases of the AVA2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite structure.30 However, the concentration ratios of each reactant used are slightly different than the ones used in this work. Finally, we observe that the XRD patterns of [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3 (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) show two sets of peaks, which can be assigned to either MAPbI3 or 5-AVAPbI3. This indicates the coexistence of these two phases in the samples and is in good accordance with the results of UV-VIS analysis.

 Fig. 3  XRD analysis of the five [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3 samples depending on the 5-AVAi content. The coexistence of the two phases, MAPbI3 and 5-AVAPbI3, is verified by the observable phase transition between the two configurations. 
The UV-Vis absorption spectra, Fig. 4, show that MAPbI3 achieved an optical bandgap of 1.58 eV, which agrees with other published works reporting bandgaps of ∼1.6 eV,47–50 making the reference samples of this series reliable. Analysing the UV-VIS spectra in Fig. 4, and starting from the MAPbI3 reference absorption curve, we observe a consistent transition of the absorption peaks towards the optical bandgap of 5-AVAPbI3 with an energy gap of 2.33 eV. The optical gap of the samples shown in Table 1 was estimated by the extrapolation of the linear region at the beginning of each absorption peak to the x-axis intercept, as indicated by the grey dashed lines in Fig. 4. On the other hand, Table 1 also shows the values of the principal absorption bands obtained from the absorption curve derivatives (Fig. S1, ESI†). Two characteristic bands in the visible region of the spectra are appreciable in all samples containing a fraction of the MA cation, one at low energy and the second one at higher energy. The two bands have energies of ∼1.6 eV and ∼2.5 eV, respectively. The remaining sample, which contains only the 5-AVA cation, confirms the absence of the first characteristic absorption band, suggesting that it originated due to the effect of the MA ion on the cavity. Using theoretical calculations we analysed in more detail the effect of the MA and 5-AVA ions on the bands of the Fermi level frontier.

Theoretical results
Based on the optimized geometry of atomic coordinates and lattice parameters, and maintaining the lattice orthogonally fixed as discussed above, we found an excellent performance of the DFT-PW/PBE-D3 calculation scheme for reproducing the published crystallographic data. The experimental lattice parameters (a = 8.836 Å, b = 12.58 Å and c = 8.555) used to compare our theoretical results in Fig. 5(a) were obtained from ref. 32 determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction at 100 K and structure solution using the Superflip algorithm. An additional lattice parameter from ref. 51 was included in Fig. 5(a) as for other samples to compare our results. The DFT-PW/PBE-D3 scheme of calculation only overestimates a maximum of 1.4% of the lattice vector a in the MAPbI3 phase. For the bandgap, we obtained a value of 1.7 eV, in agreement with the reported values,52,53 showing non-dependency on the DFT-PW/PBE-D3 or DFT-AE/PBE-D3 scheme of calculation. In other words, the scalar relativistic effect considered in the DFT-AE/PBE-D3 scheme is negligible over this parameter. On the other hand, the obtained bandgap value, using the empirical dispersion correction D3, is 0.1 eV which is smaller than its counterpart (before correction), and although minimal, the volume of the unit cell is observed to be reduced. This result is in agreement with other published works,52,54 and indicates that for the appropriate treatment of the ionic interaction in this type of crystal, it is necessary to include some correction to the dispersion interactions.

The systematic substitution of MA by 5-AVA ions in a single unit cell of the orthorhombic phase of MAPbI3 shows a clear tendency over the size of lattice parameter a and the bandgap of the single crystal cell, finding both in a direct relation with the increment of 5-AVA ions in the cell, as shown in Fig. 5. As expected, a large effect on the volume of the cell is appreciable, which is coherent with the increase of ionic radius values from 2.17 Å to 5.44 Å for MA and 5-AVA, respectively, calculated according to equations of Cheetham et al.55 The increase of the ionic radii is two times larger when MA is replaced by 5-AVA. As a result of the accommodation of this large new organic ion, the calculated Pb–I bond distances in quasi-octahedral PbI6 are increased from 3.2 Å in the pure phase MAPbI3 to more than 4.0 Å in the pure phase AVAPbI3. This structural change has a direct relation with the large effect measured in the theoretical bandgap from the minimal substitution of MA by 5-AVA. From an energetic point of view, the calculated bandgaps shown in Fig. 5(b) of the pure phases, MAPbI3 (1.76 eV) and 5-AVAPbI3 (2.63 eV), are in good agreement with our experimental measures of the principal absorption bands shown in Table 1. However, the bandgaps calculated for the mixed phases (x = 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25) have a very poor agreement with the measured experimental values. We can attribute this discrepancy to that the theoretical perovskite model used based on the pure and infinitely periodic 3D orthorhombic structure of MAPbI3, whereby the substitution of MA ions by 5-AVA is homogeneously replicated through the crystal. Large theoretical bandgap values are obtained as a result of the strong distortion of the octahedral PbI6 structure due to the incorporation of AVA ions in the cavity of the MA ion. In contrast, as already explained, the samples analysed experimentally can present subdomains corresponding to pure 3D and 2D perovskite (see Fig. 7 of the schematic model),46 each with characteristic optical transitions observable in the spectrum, as shown in Fig. 4. For example, with a 1:4 ratio for 5-AVA:MA ions, we can suppose full substitution of MA ions only in the surface unit cell or close to them, and not substitution in the bulk of the crystal (Fig. 7b). Our experiment reflects well this phenomenon, as previously discussed, showing the two characteristic absorption bands in the mixed samples. Nevertheless, the theoretical bandgaps show the mixed sample transition to the fully substituted 5-AVA unit cell, with a systematic increment of the bandgap values 1.74 eV < 2.11 eV < 2.18 eV < 2.48 eV < 2.51 eV in the same order as the substitution index increment of 5-AVA in the [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3 samples. We attribute the increase of the bandgaps to the stabilization of the frontier conduction bands (CB) associated mainly with the formation of unoccupied orbitals from the 5-AVA ion closed to the Fermi level, as shown in Fig. 8c. Another important energetic aspect associated with the stability of the cell is the value of the cohesive energy. The calculated cohesive energy of the five phases was performed following the procedure developed by Yong-Hyon et al.54Fig. 6 shows that the cohesive energy is in line with the values reported for MAPbI3, and also agrees with the experimental results on the gain in the stability of perovskite crystals by partial substitution of MA ions by 5-AVA ions. In contrast to what we might think about the adverse effect on stability due to the strong structural distortion caused by the ionic radius of 5-AVA, the stability of the unit cell is favoured, being even 1.8 eV higher in phase 5-AVAPbI3 in comparison with that of MAPbI3. This result is also related to the increase of the bandgap values, as previously discussed.

From an electronic structure point of view, the DOS and pDOS of MAPbI3 in the vicinity of the Fermi level show a typical distribution also observed in other published works.56–58 The valence band maximum (VBM) is mainly on the iodide atoms and the conduction band minimum (CBM) belongs to lead atoms, as shown in Fig. 8a. Also, the orbital projections of these bands respond to typical p-character in both iodide and lead atoms of the MAPbI3 crystal (see Fig. 8b). On the other hand, in this phase of perovskite, the MA bands are negligible in the frontier of the Fermi level. Thus, once the systematic substitution of MA by 5-AVA takes place, a rearrangement of the frontier bands in all cases is observed (Fig. S2, ESI†), being mostly appreciable in the CB edge. In the case when MA is completely substituted, the CB edge mainly localized over Pb atoms in the MAPbI3 phase changes to localization on the 5-AVA ion with mostly p-character bands, in the 5-AVAPbI3 phase (see Fig. 8c and d). In contrast, the VB edge is almost unaffected by the substitution, with the minimal occurrence of 5-AVA states closed to the frontier of the Fermi level. The presence of metallic Pb in halide perovskites indicates that Pb is unsaturated and thus, iodine deficiencies may also be present in the perovskite lattice of the reference sample.59 This implies that the application of additives, such as AVAI, can effectively suppress the formation of metallic Pb via either direct electron donation to unsaturated Pb or immobilization of iodine as already reported.44,45 Additionally, our theoretical results show an increase of the PbI distances with the inclusion of 5-AVA ions in the unit cell, resulting in a most favourable interaction of 5-AVA ions with the unsaturated Pb atoms, appreciable through the appearance of 5-AVA states in the CBM, as shown in Fig. 8(c). A qualitative description of these bands in the frontier region is shown in Fig. S3 of the ESI.†

The optical properties, in particular, the imaginary part of the dielectric constant (ε2), were determined with the SIESTA program60 through a single point calculation of the converged geometry of five phases [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3. The real part of the dielectric constant (ε1) was extracted from ε2 using the Kramers–Kronig method.61 Finally, the frequency-dependent absorption coefficient (α) is given by:  with this equation, we compared the experimental UV-Vis absorption curves with the simulated curves of alpha obtained from calculated theoretical models of the five samples of perovskite studied in this work.
The results of the simulated curves obtained from the dielectric function showed a direct relation of the blue-shift of the absorption coefficient with the systematic increment of 5-AVA ions in the unit cell model (see Fig. 9). However, the phases with x = 0.25 and x = 0.5 show a very small shift (<0.2 eV) with respect to the reference curve of MAPbI3. The calculated curves show less blue-shift than other modified perovskites used to improve stability, like for example, the substitution of iodine by chloride or iodine by bromide.23 This result indicates that the substitution of MA by 5-AVA in low quantities can maintain the optical properties similar to the original MAPbI3 perovskites, improving the global stability of the crystal, as was previously shown.

Conclusions
In summary, we generate a series of five [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3 samples with a well-established procedure which resulted in a reliable sample to perform XRD and UV-Vis absorption measurements. The XRD results show the coexistence of the MAPbI3 and 5-AVAPbI3 phases and a well-defined transition between the samples. The same behaviour is obtained from the absorption spectra, resulting in promising optical bandgaps of 1.58 eV for MAPbI3 and 2.33 eV for 5-AVAPbI3. Using theoretical calculations, we found reliable agreement between the experimentally measured bandgaps and the calculated values, for the pure phases. By contrast, poor agreement for the transition samples was found. On the other hand, a direct relationship between the cell stability (through the increase of cohesive energy) and the 5-AVA rate of substitution was found, also closely related to the systematic increase of the theoretical bandgaps. The DOS and pDOS of the samples showed that apparently, the presence of atomic orbitals of 5-AVA in the CB zone close to the Fermi level provokes a larger bandgap, which could be attributed to the low reactivity of the perovskite with respect to the other derivatives.62–64 Finally, this work shows that the moderate substitution of MA ions by 5-AVA ions in perovskite lead-based solar cells allows modulating several key aspects of the cell with the purpose of driving eventually the design of new materials.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the crystalline structure of the orthorhombic phase of MAPbI3. A well-resolved position and orientation of MA ions are appreciable at this symmetry.	 

 	Fig. 2  Comparison of the experimental XRD data with the published data of Yamada Y. et al.41 (CSID data) for MAPbI3. All peaks can be assigned either to the perovskite, the substrate, or PbI2.	 

 	Fig. 3  XRD analysis of the five [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3 samples depending on the 5-AVAi content. The coexistence of the two phases, MAPbI3 and 5-AVAPbI3, is verified by the observable phase transition between the two configurations.	 

 	Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of the different phases of [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3. Two optical transitions corresponding to bandgap energies of 1.58 eV and 2.33 eV for MAPbI3 and 5-AVAPbI3 respectively, can be observed.	 


x = 1	1.58	1.63

x = 0.75	1.59, 2.14	1.65, 2.47

x = 0.50	1.60, 2.25	1.66, 2.47

x = 0.25	1.59, 2.30	1.65, 2.46

x = 0	2.33	2.45

 	Fig. 5  The behaviour of theoretically predicted lattice parameter a (a) and bandgap (b) in the different phases of [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3 studied compared with ref. 32 and51 in (a), and with our experimental values of the MAPbI3 phase in (b).	 

 	Fig. 6  Calculated cohesive energy for the different phases of [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3 compared with the work in ref. 51.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) Schematic representation of a carbon-based perovskite solar cell where the perovskite is introduced by infiltration. (b) Schematic representation of the AVAi molecule and its interaction with the MA halide perovskite.	 

 	Fig. 8  DOS and pDOS calculated at the DFT-AE/PBE-D3 level of theory for phases MAPbI3 (a) and (b), and 5-AVAPbI3 (c) and (d). For a better appreciation, pDOS is separated by atoms (Pb, I) and orbital (s, p).	 

 		 

 	Fig. 9  Simulated curves of the absorption coefficient calculated for the five phases of [5-AVA(1−x)MAx]PbI3 (short dashed lines) compared with our UV-Vis spectrum of MAPbI3 (black line).
