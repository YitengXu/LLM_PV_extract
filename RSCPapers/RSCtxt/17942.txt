    , Accepted 14th August 2019First published on 22nd August 2019AbstractFeSe2–carbon nanotube (FeSe2–CNT) hybrid microspheres are investigated as anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), exhibiting a high specific capacity of 571.2 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with excellent rate performance and cycling stability. The FeSe2–CNT hybrid LIBs could withstand the high-voltage pulse of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and be charged by TENGs directly for harvesting energy with high stability.
Recently, the increasing consumption of fossil fuels with severe environmental pollution has become a threat to global society. There is an urgent need for the design of highly efficient energy-storage systems compatible with renewable energy forms, such as solar energy,1 wind power2 and triboelectricity.3–5 Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are cutting-edge mechanical energy harvesters for conversion of ubiquitous ambient mechanical energy into electricity, which can be fabricated as cost-efficient, flexible, and miniaturized devices to power low-consumption microelectronics, due to their attractive features of sustainability, high output voltage, and simple operation.6,7 However, energy storage remains the bottleneck for TENGs.4,8
Typically, the TENG output poses challenges for charging batteries due to its characteristics of high voltage, low current and large internal impedance.9 Previous studies have shown that electricity generated by TENGs can be stored in batteries under the assistance of an energy management circuit, usually a transformer or a power management unit.10 However, these auxiliary components are energy-consuming, thus complicating the devices and limiting the energy conversion efficiency of the system. Thus, it is significant to construct an energy-storage device that can be directly charged by the pulsed current generated by a TENG without a transformer.
Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are the typical energy storage devices commonly used nowadays. Since the conversion-reaction mechanism was proposed for anodes,11 transition metal compounds including oxides, sulfides, and selenides have been investigated for fast charge/discharge and long cycle life.12–19 Among various candidates, FeSe2 is a typical transition metal selenide with a narrow band gap of 1.0 eV and high electrical conductivity of 10−4 μS cm−1, theoretically having better rate capacity and lower internal resistance than oxides and sulfides, which is attractive for TENG charging. In this work, we have constructed FeSe2–carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrids to fabricate LIBs for storing energy generated from TENGs. By the combination of FeSe2 and CNTs, the electronic conductivity, charge transfer process, and abundant Li+ trapping sites can be evidently facilitated in the anodes. The FeSe2–CNT hybrid LIBs exhibit high rate capacity and cycling stability and particularly have potential for harvesting energy from TENGs as expected.
The FeSe2–CNT hybrid microspheres, as well as single FeSe2 microspheres, were synthesized by a rational hydrothermal method (see Experimental section in ESI†). The morphologies of both samples are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and shown in Fig. 1a–d. FeSe2 displays a microsphere shape with a diameter of ca. 2–6 μm. Higher magnification of a single microsphere from Fig. 1b shows that the FeSe2 microspheres are composed of multiple closely packed elongated submicron nano-octahedra with a crystalline size of ca. 200–600 nm. This unique structure can be attributed to the morphology-directing effect of citric acid.20 The FeSe2–CNT hybrid maintains almost the same morphology as single FeSe2 microspheres, except that the microspheres are tangled by one-dimensional CNTs among the microspheres (Fig. 1c), on the surface (Fig. 1d) and in the interior of the microspheres (Fig. 1e). Higher magnification of the TEM image (Fig. 1f) shows that some of the CNTs are attached in the FeSe2 submicron nano-octahedra. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images of the FeSe2–CNTs in Fig. 1g reveal that the FeSe2–CNTs are polycrystalline. The clear finger images with the lattice distances of 0.287 nm correspond to the standard interplanar spacing of the cubic orthorhombic FeSe2(101) plane. The HRTEM images and SAED patterns of FeSe2 and CNTs are shown and analysed in Fig. S1 (ESI†), further indicating that these samples are polycrystalline. The element mappings of the FeSe2–CNT hybrid in Fig. 1h indicate that Fe and Se are of uniform distribution, while the CNTs are dispersed in the FeSe2 submicron nano-octahedra and on the surface. The elemental mapping images of FeSe2 in Fig. S2 (ESI†) show a homogeneous distribution of Fe and Se atoms with the atomic percentages of 66.03% and 33.97%, respectively.

Fig. S3 (ESI†) exhibits X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of FeSe2 and FeSe2–CNTs. All the diffraction peaks can be attributed to the crystal planes of orthorhombic FeSe2 (JCPDS no. 79-1892), suggesting that pure phase FeSe2 is successfully synthesized without any impurity phase. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of FeSe2–CNTs (Fig. S4, ESI†) and FeSe2 (Fig. S5, ESI†) confirm the presence of Fe, Se, and C elements in the samples. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe 2p, Se 3d and C 1s indicate the presence of Fe(II)/Fe(III)–O, Fe–Se, Se–O, CC (sp2), C–C (sp3), C–O and CO in FeSe2–CNTs. The specific surface area of FeSe2–CNTs is calculated to be 9.99 m2 g−1, which is evidently higher than that of FeSe2 (1.01 m2 g−1), based on the nitrogen isothermal adsorption–desorption curves (Fig. S6, ESI†). The sharp peak in the pore-size distribution of FeSe2–CNTs (Fig. S6b, ESI†) indicates the presence of micropores with a mean diameter of 2.5 nm, which results from the CNTs. The broad peak manifests the existence of mesopores with a diameter ranging from 5 to 26 nm. The large surface area of FeSe2–CNTs is beneficial for the exposure of abundant active sites and the contact between electrode and electrolyte.21 The content of CNTs in FeSe2–CNTs is calculated to be 6.5 wt% according to the thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) curves (Fig. S7, ESI†). (see ESI† for the detailed calculation method.)
Using FeSe2 and FeSe2–CNT electrodes, lithium ion batteries were assembled in 2032-coin cells (see Experimental section in ESI†). To ensure the high reversibility of lithium storage reactions, a voltage window of 0.01–2.7 V was selected to evaluate the electrochemical performance (Fig. S8, ESI†). Fig. 2a shows the cycling performance and corresponding Coulombic efficiency of FeSe2 and FeSe2–CNT LIBs at a current destiny of 0.5 A g−1. The discharge capacity of the FeSe2–CNT electrode slightly decreases initially and stabilizes at 571.2 mA h g−1 in the 3rd cycle, and then it keeps stable until 50 cycles (with the capacity retention of 93.5% at the 50th cycle), which is much superior to that of FeSe2 (383.5 mA h g−1 in the 3rd cycle with capacity retention of 74.0% at 50th cycle). The capacity quickly decreases after 50 cycles arriving at the minimum value of 201.4 mA h g−1 at the 115th cycle, and then gradually increases in the following cycles reaching 272.5 mA h g−1 at the 200th cycle (Fig. S9, ESI†). Besides, the FeSe2–CNT LIBs show high initial Coulombic efficiency (87.7%) and high values during cycling, indicating good reversibility. According to previous studies, the irreversible capacity loss may be due to the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) membrane, and decomposition of electrolyte.17 Remarkably, the discharge capacity of the FeSe2–CNT electrode exceeds the theoretical value of FeSe2 (500 mA h g−1), which may be caused by lithium storage in the interfacial or polymeric layer and the decomposition of electrolyte.17 Evidently, the FeSe2–CNT hybrid exhibits high cycling stability, which is superior to that of FeSe2.

The discharge/charge profiles of FeSe2 and FeSe2–CNT LIBs at different numbers of cycles were studied at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 (Fig. S10, ESI†). For the FeSe2–CNT electrode, a long voltage plateau occurs at ∼1.5 V in the 1st discharge process and this plateau splits into two plateaus at ∼2.0 and ∼1.55 V after the 2nd cycle. During the charge process, two voltage plateaus can be observed at ∼1.9 and ∼2.2 V in the first cycle. The voltage plateaus gradually shift downward in the discharge process and shift upward in the charge process as the number of cycles increases, which can be attributed to the degradation of the anode structure or the increasing degree of polarization.
The rate performances of FeSe2–CNTs and FeSe2 LIBs were investigated by increasing the current density from 0.1 to 15 A g−1 (Fig. 2b). The FeSe2–CNT hybrid delivers specific capacities of 628.0, 534.9, 465.9, 406.8 and 292.8 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. Remarkably, the capacity can still be 148.3 mA h g−1 even at an ultra-high current density of 15 A g−1, which is almost 7 times as large as that of FeSe2 (20.8 mA h g−1). When the current density returns to 0.1 A g−1, the capacity increases to 667.42 mA h g−1, close to the original value, suggesting the fast Li+ transport kinetics and the robust material structure with strong tolerance to volume expansion/contraction in the repeated lithiation/delithiation process. The charge plateaus (∼2.25 V) of FeSe2–CNTs (Fig. S11, ESI†) display a small voltage evolution of ∼0.2 V over the current density ranging from 0.1 to 10 A g−1, possibly indicating the presence of a hierarchical pore structure contributing to the alleviated polarization.22 The capacity of FeSe2–CNTs at 2.5 A g−1 exhibits similar variation with cycling to that at 0.5 A g−1, remaining 182.6 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles (Fig. S12, ESI†). The phase and morphology changes during the electrochemical process (Fig. S13, ESI†) may be responsible for the steady increase of capacity after 160 cycles.
To evaluate the electrochemical dynamical behaviors, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured for FeSe2–CNTs and FeSe2 LIBs after different numbers of cycles at discharging to 1.5 V (Fig. S14, ESI†). The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of FeSe2–CNTs gradually decreases from 202.9 to 11.65 Ω cm−2 during the 50th to 1000th cycles, which could be ascribed to the surface activation and lattice expansion triggering better Li+ transfer,22 as well as a side reaction of the Cu foil forming new substances such as CuSe2 (Fig. S13, ESI†). Furthermore, a low electrolyte resistance (Re, 11.23 Ω cm−2) and a low solid-state interface resistance (Rsei, 64.78 Ω cm−2) of FeSe2–CNTs at the 1000th cycle is in good agreement with the long-term cycling performance. These results indicate that the FeSe2–CNT hybrid anode has excellent rate performance and good stability at large current density, which could be ascribed to the following reasons: (1) the high electrical conductivity of FeSe2 and CNTs accelerate the charge transfer process at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces; (2) the unique microspherical structure and the mesopores in FeSe2–CNTs can alleviate the volume variation in the repeated charge/discharge process; (3) the defects on the surface of oxidized CNTs can act as Li+ storage sites, contributing to the specific capacity.17
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to investigate the redox behaviors of FeSe2–CNT hybrid LIBs at different scan rates ranging from 0.2 to 1 mV s−1. There are in total 4 redox peaks presented in Fig. 2c, which are denoted as peaks 1–4 corresponding to the lithiation/delithiation process. The presence of two reduction peaks at 1.93 and 1.45 V indicates the formation of LixFeSe2, Fe and Li2Se, respectively. The two oxidation peaks at 1.97 and 2.32 V at 0.1 mV s−1 illustrate the formation of intermediate LixFeSe2 and fully charged product FeSe2, respectively. These plateaus are in accordance with the voltage plateaus in the charge/discharge profiles (Fig. S10b, ESI†). As the scan rate of CV increases, the peak current increases, which is neither proportional to the square root of the scan rate nor in a linear relationship with the scan rate. This indicates that the charge/discharge kinetics of the FeSe2–CNT anode is controlled by the kinetics of both non-faradaic and faradaic processes,20 which can be further determined by the relationship between the peak current (i) and the scan rate (v) according to eqn (1) and (2): i = avb(1) log(i) = blog(v) + log(a)(2)where i is the peak current, and v is the scan rate, and the values of a and b can be extracted from eqn (2). Generally, an electrochemical reaction can be either dominated by the diffusion-controlled kinetics (b = 0.5) or pure pseudocapacitive kinetics (b = 1).22Fig. 2d shows the relationship between log(i) and log(v) at the redox potentials. The calculated b values are 0.78, 1.30, 0.79 and 0.63 for peaks 1–4, respectively, indicating a mainly pseudocapacitive behavior for the FeSe2–CNT anode. The large contribution ratio of pseudocapacitance and large ion diffusion coefficient (Fig. S15, ESI†) are greatly beneficial to the fast charge storage and fast redox kinetics, resulting in excellent rate performance.20
To demonstrate the practicality, a FeSe2–CNT LIB was connected to a TENG to harvest its generated energy. The charging system is shown in Fig. 3a, where the structural representations of the TENG and LIB are also displayed. The output generated by the TENG is always characterized with ultrahigh voltage (several hundreds volt) and ultralow current (several μA), as illustrated in Fig. S16 (ESI†). In a conventional manner, a voltage regulator (VR) is included in the charging system to alleviate the damage to batteries caused by high pulse voltage. With the assistance of VR, the maximum voltage can be stabilized to ∼3 V. In this way, the damage to the battery can be largely reduced at the cost of the loss of current density and electric power (consumed by VR). In our case, the output high voltage pulse of the TENG is 489, 569 and 589 V at the low frequency of 5, 10 and 15 Hz, respectively. The output current of this system without VR is 2 μA at 10 Hz, which is shunted to 0.9 μA with the VR chip. In our work, the circuit diagrams of the charging system with and without VR are shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†). For harvesting energy, all the batteries were discharged to 1.6 V and then they were charged by a TENG. As displayed in Fig. 3b, when the voltage of the LIBs increases from 1.6 to 1.73 V, it only needs 32 min without VR, while it takes as long as 130 min with VR. This indicates that the VR limits the charging speed and consumes considerable energy, which can be saved by using the direct charging system in Fig. 3a. The FeSe2–CNT hybrid LIBs provided here can withstand the high-voltage pulse and store the energy from the TENG efficiently.

To further investigate the maximal energy conversion efficiency for the charging system, the FeSe2–CNT hybrid LIB was directly charged by a TENG at different frequencies without any VR circuit. The FeSe2–CNT LIBs can harvest the electric energy of 1.5, 2.7 and 4 μA h from the TENG at 5, 10 and 15 Hz within 80 minutes (Fig. 3c). It is obvious that LIBs will harvest more energy from the TENG at higher frequency. Therefore, the stability of the FeSe2–CNT-based LIBs for harvesting energy from TENG application was investigated by directly charging the LIBs with a TENG at a frequency of 15 Hz for different cycles (Fig. 3d). The FeSe2–CNT LIBs are charged directly by the high pulse voltage of the TENG (∼570 V, 3 μA) at the 1st, 20th and 50th cycles. The FeSe2–CNT-based LIBs can collect electric energy of 3.75, 3.50 and 3.25 μA h after the 1st, 20th and 50th cycle in the potential range of 1.6–1.8 V, respectively. These facts firmly confirm that the FeSe2–CNT LIBs can withstand the high-voltage pulse of TENGs and have high stability when directly charged by TENGs, which could be attributed to the stable structure of the FeSe2–CNTs, ultrafast Li-storage kinetics and low electrode/electrolyte resistance, indicating that the FeSe2–CNT hybrid LIBs have a promising application in energy storage systems with TENGs.
It is found that the circuit current of the TENG increases from 0.5 to 3.5 μA with increasing frequencies from 2 Hz to 18 Hz (Fig. 3e), which will lead to increased loading electric energy collected by the battery. Based on this tendency, it can be inferred that the circuit current of the TENG can reach several mA when the frequency reaches approximately several kHz.10,23 Furthermore, owing to the excellent rate capacity of a FeSe2–CNT battery, it will show outstanding performance when charged by a TENG at the frequency of several kHz with high circuit current.
In summary, FeSe2–CNT hybrid microspheres demonstrate extraordinarily high specific capacity (571.2 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), rate behaviour (148.3 mA h g−1 at 15 A g−1) and cycling stability as an anode material for LIBs. The FeSe2–CNT-based LIB could withstand the high-voltage pulse of a TENG and have high stability when directly charged by a TENG, which improves the efficiency of energy storage systems. The ultrafast Li-storage kinetics ensures the FeSe2–CNTs hybri LIBs as promising candidates in a fast and frequent charging mode, especially in an energy storage system with a TENG.
