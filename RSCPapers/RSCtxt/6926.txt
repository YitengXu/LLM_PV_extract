    , Accepted 2nd January 2018First published on 3rd January 2018AbstractExploring new single, active photocatalysts for solar-water splitting is highly desirable to expedite current research on solar–chemical energy conversion. In particular, Z-scheme-based composites (ZBCs) have attracted extensive attention due to their unique charge transfer pathway, broader redox range, and stronger redox power compared to conventional heterostructures. In the present report, we have for the first time explored Cu3P, a new, single photocatalyst for solar-water splitting applications. Moreover, a novel ZBC system composed of Bi2WO6–Cu3P was designed employing a simple method of ball-milling complexation. The synthesized materials were examined and further investigated through various microscopic, spectroscopic, and surface area characterization methods, which have confirmed the successful hybridization between Bi2WO6 and Cu3P and the formation of a ZBC system that shows the ideal position of energy levels for solar-water splitting. Notably, the ZBC composed of Bi2WO6–Cu3P is a mediator- and co-catalyst-free photocatalyst system. The improved photocatalytic efficiency obtained with this system compared to other ZBC systems assisted by mediators and co-catalysts establishes the critical importance of interfacial solid–solid contact and the well-balanced position of energy levels for solar-water splitting. The promising solar-water splitting under optimum composition conditions highlighted the relationship between effective charge separation and composition.
Introduction
Solar-water splitting closely mimics the nature-inspired photosynthetic process, which can provide a means to convert solar energy into hydrogen energy.1 Previous works have investigated a number of photocatalysts for water splitting, mostly for ultraviolet (UV)-sensitive photocatalysts.2,3 However, UV covers only 4% of the solar spectrum, and UV-based photocatalysts have suffered from two intrinsic limitations: higher band gap and non-ideality of the redox potential. Basically, these two variables are contradictory and cannot be met simultaneously in a single photocatalyst. A narrower band gap ensures the maximized utilization of solar light, whereas it decreases the redox range of the photocatalytic system. Similarly, a broader range of redox potentials in photocatalysts generally tends to exhibit a higher band gap. In parallel, the rare availability of a single photocatalyst in the visible light range is also a hurdle.
The conventional heterostructure provides a means to suppress electron–hole recombination by forming interfacial barrier between two semiconductors. Although light absorption is increased by using a heterostructure system comprising photosystems PS I and PS II, it is generally accompanied by an undesirable formation of a narrow redox range, as shown in Fig. 1a. In a Z-scheme-based composite (ZBC) system, a broader redox range could result in much stronger reducing and oxidizing powers, which is analogous to the processes in photosynthesis, shown in Fig. 1b.4 In particular, ZBC overcomes the thermodynamic energy barrier for overall solar-water splitting.5 By virtue of these advantages, ZBCs have shown promising performance in solar-water splitting.6 However, their applications are mostly limited by the co-presence of redox mediators, such as acceptor/donor (A/D) pairs, e.g., Fe3+/Fe2+, IO3−/I−, and NO3−/NO2−.7 These mediators have some flaws involving the possibility of backward reaction between the electrons present in the conduction band (CB) of PS I and the holes present in the valence band (VB) of PS II, which consequently leads to a significant loss of charge carriers. Furthermore, the mediators absorb solar light, which decreases the number of available photons to be used by photocatalysts. Similarly, the long-term stability of redox mediators over a wide range of pH values is also a serious concern.8 The aforementioned problems can be sorted out by using solid-state electron mediators, such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO), Ag, and Au, for Z-scheme photo-catalysis.9–11 However, designing and exploring Z-scheme systems employing novel solid-state electron mediators is quite challenging due to the identification of dynamic equilibrium between electron-accepting and -donating abilities of the mediator in order to ensure that it remains unchanged during the reaction.12 Similarly, co-catalysts are also adopted with mediators in order to suppress such backward reactions, and they can further act as trapping sites for the charge carriers. When heavy metals are used as co-catalysts, they can further provide additional active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). At the same time, they could catalyze the undesirable forward reaction between H2 and O2 to form water. Therefore, their concentration and selectivity are also critical considerations in designing co-catalyst-assisted photocatalytic systems.13 Accordingly, the development of a mediator- and co-catalyst-free ZBC system is highly required.

Various materials can be used for ZBC systems depending on the position of their energy levels. For example, Cu3P is a p-type semiconductor with a band gap of 1.3–1.6 eV and is a promising candidate for ZBC systems.14,15 It has also been shown to be compatible for the formation of relevant heterostructures with TiO2, Au, and CdS.15–17 However, it has not been explored to determine its full potential for photocatalytic applications, especially as a single photocatalyst for solar-water splitting. Instead, Cu3P has exhibited significant contribution in electrochemical water splitting and lithium-ion batteries.18,19 Meanwhile, with a careful consideration of the energy level, Bi2WO6 can be chosen as a paired photocatalyst with Cu3P in the formation of the ZBC system. Bi2WO6 is a popular ternary oxide with an indirect band gap of 2.8 eV, which makes it a good choice for a visible light-driven photocatalyst.20,21 Also, Bi2WO6 can be considered as a strong candidate for the photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, unfortunately, it requires the co-use of an electron acceptor, e.g., AgNO3, to perform the OER.22 Therefore, it can be expected that the proposed ZBC system comprising Cu3P and Bi2WO6 would exhibit promising performance in solar-water splitting while overcoming the limitations of each species.
Two different synthetic routes have been employed to date for the formation of ZBCs, using either a chemical or a physical method. Chemical routes mainly consist of sequential chemical treatments using one material as a parent material; for example, TiO2/g-C3N4 was prepared by calcination of conventional P25 TiO2 and urea, and a CdS/TiO2 system was formed upon immersing TiO2 films in CdCl2 and Na2S solutions.23,24 On the other hand, physical routes generally use the electrostatic attractions between PS I and PS II to form an overall ZBC, such as BiVO4 (for OER) possessing a negative charge and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh systems (for HER) possessing a positive charge, showing maximum efficiency under optimum pH conditions.25 Similarly, the use of a mechanical or physical force, such as mortar and pestle or ball milling, can also provide effective solid–solid interfaces for ZBCs. Examples have been presented in ZBCs of WO3/CuBi2O4 and WO3/NaNbO3.26,27 Among these mechanical/physical methods, the use of ball milling method is the most popular since it is straightforward and robust while obviating the use of complex and tedious chemical treatments. Moreover, it can impart effective solid–solid interfacial contact without employing a mediator species.
Based on this understanding, the present report proposes two significant contributions for developing a solar-water splitting system. First, a single photocatalyst, Cu3P, is newly explored to show its solar-water splitting performance and is shown to be a valuable addition to the library for solar-water splitting along with other single photocatalysts, e.g., ZnO, SrTiO3, Ta3N5, and Ta-ON.28 Second, a novel ZBC system of Bi2WO6–Cu3P is proposed for high performance solar-water splitting. The presented ZBC materials avoid the use of any redox or solid-state electron mediator, simply enabling the implementation of a PS I–PS II system. In particular, the use of co-catalysts was also excluded from this system, completely realizing a mediator- and co-catalyst-free ZBC system. The energy levels of these complexed semiconductors are precisely altered to allow for the feasible transfer of charge carriers from the CB of Bi2WO6 to the VB of Cu3P, thereby exhibiting facilitated electron–hole recombination at the solid–solid interface of these semi-conductors. The synthesized ZBC photocatalysts of Bi2WO6–Cu3P with varied composite concentrations were investigated for solar-water splitting and showed promising performance.
Experimental
Materials
Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), sodium tungstate (Na2WO4·2H2O), red phosphorus, and copper metal were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Absolute ethanol was purchased from Merck, and nitric acid was purchased from Samchun Chemicals, Korea. All reagents were of analytical grade and used without any further purification. Deionized (DI) water with a resistance of 18.2 MΩ was used in all experiments.
Synthesis of Bi2WO6
Bi2WO6 was synthesized using a literature-reported method.21 In a typical synthesis, for the first solution A, 1 mmol of sodium tungstate (Na2WO4·2H2O) was dissolved in 60 ml of DI water. Similarly, for the second solution B, bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) was dissolved in 20 ml of a 0.5 M nitric acid solution. When both solutions A and B were clear, they were mixed, adjusted to pH 7 using diluted HCl and NaOH, and stirred for 2 h. The final solution was placed in a 120 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and an oven at 160 °C for 24 h. After removing from the oven and the autoclave, the samples were cooled to room temperature, washed sequentially with ethanol and DI water three times each, and dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight.
Synthesis of Cu3P
Copper phosphide was synthesized using a similar approach but with a slight modification.29 For this, 1 mmol of Cu metal was ground with 10 mmol of red phosphorus using a mortar and pestle. The mixed powder was collected, mixed in 80 ml DI water, and stirred for 30 min. Next, this solution was placed in a Teflon-lined stain steel autoclave and an oven at 200 °C for 24 h. After their removal from the oven and the autoclave, the samples were cooled to room temperature, washed sequentially with carbon disulphide (CS2), benzene, ethanol, and DI water two times each, and then dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. When the product of Cu3P was collected, it was further ground in stainless steel vials in a planetary ball milling machine (8000D Dual Mixer/Mill, SPEX Sample Prep) for 15 min with 3 cycles of 5 min running and 3 min rest. Next, ethanol was added to the vials, and the samples were again subjected to ball milling for 5 min. The material was separated from ethanol using centrifugation for 20 min under 15557 rcf. Finally, ball milled Cu3P was collected after drying in an oven at 60 °C overnight.
Synthesis of the Bi2WO6–Cu3P composite
In a typical method for composite formation, different amounts of pre-synthesized Bi2WO6 and Cu3P were mixed together using mortar and pestle and then mechanically mixed in stainless steel vials using a ball mill. Ball milling operation conditions were identical to those for Cu3P, i.e., 15 min, followed by addition of ethanol into vials and milling for 5 min. Similarly, the final composite powder was separated from ethanol using centrifugation and dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. Different samples with varying amounts of Bi2WO6 were synthesized and named Bi2WO6(10%)–Cu3P, Bi2WO6(20%)–Cu3P, Bi2WO6(30%)–Cu3P, and Bi2WO6(40%)–Cu3P, respectively. Also, non-mixed samples of Cu3P and Bi2WO6 were prepared.
Characterization methods
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-7600F, JEOL) was used to observe particle sizes and morphologies. The crystal structures of the synthesized heterostructures were characterized using a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 Focus, Bruker Instruments, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation (1.540 Å) in the 2θ range of 10° to 70° at a scan rate of 0.05° s−1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-3010, JEOL, Japan) was performed with an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization study was performed (ESCA 2000 instrument, VG Microtech, UK) with Al Kα X-rays. Binding energy values were corrected and calibrated to a C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. High-resolution peaks were deconvoluted using Gaussian–Lorentzian functions with identical full-width-at-half-maxima (FWHM) after Shirley background subtraction. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas were evaluated on the basis of nitrogen adsorption isotherms and measured at −196 °C using a gas adsorption apparatus (ASAP 2000, Micromeritics, USA). All samples were degassed at 180 °C before nitrogen adsorption measurements. The BET surface area was determined using adsorption data in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.06–0.2. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution was determined from desorption data. UV-visible absorption spectra were collected using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu, Japan). For photoluminescence (PL) measurements, a PL spectrometer (Scinco, FS-2, South Korea) equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as an excitation source was used.
Photocatalytic overall water splitting
The photocatalytic water splitting experiments were performed in a 100 mL reactor with the opening sealed with silicone rubber septa at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. A solar simulator with a Xe lamp (LS-150-Xe, Abet Technologies, Inc., Milford, CT) was used as a light source to trigger the photocatalytic reaction (AM 1.5G simulated sunlight with 100 mW cm−2). A silicon reference cell (Fraunhofer ISE, Certificate No. C-ISE269) was used to calibrate the light intensity. In a typical experiment, 100 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 80 mL of a 0.5 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer solution in water (18 Ω cm−2). The suspension was bubbled with nitrogen gas to thoroughly remove the dissolved oxygen gas. During photocatalysis, the suspension was continuously stirred to ensure uniform irradiation. A 1 mL sample of the generated gas was collected using a sealable glass injection syringe, and the hydrogen and oxygen contents were analysed by gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies 7890B GC system, USA).
Results and discussion
Materials characterization
It should be noted that approaches using sequential synthesis to form the Bi2WO6–Cu3P composite using a parent material, either Bi2WO6 or Cu3P, are quite challenging; some unsuccessful attempts are described in the ESI (see Fig. S1†). To obtain the successfully synthesized Bi2WO6–Cu3P composite, we first prepared Cu3P and Bi2WO6 separately and then performed mechanical ball milling to form the composite while allowing for effective solid–solid interfacial contact between the two semiconductors. This process of solid-state composite formation via ball milling is simple and excludes the use of any strong chemical or thermal conditions. Here, structurally optimized Cu3P was synthesized via controlling the hydrothermal temperature, and the crystallinity of Cu3P was observed to increase with temperature (ESI Fig. S2†). Also, orthorhombic Bi2WO6 was synthesized hydrothermally (ESI Fig. S3†). Subsequently, both materials were ball milled, and their crystallography was investigated using XRD. Fig. 2 shows the XRD spectra for all compositions of the Bi2WO6–Cu3P composite. Spectra of reference materials JCPDS 07-2261 and JCPDS 039-0256, respectively, representing hexagonal Cu3P and orthorhombic Bi2WO6, are also provided. XRD spectra of these composites showed peaks arising from both Cu3P and Bi2WO6. The 2θ peaks at 28, 33, 47, and 56° correspond to the (131), (200), (202), and (331) planes of orthorhombic Bi2WO6, respectively. Similarly, peak positions at 36, 39, 41, 45, and 46° correspond to the (112), (202), (211), (300), and (113) planes of hexagonal Cu3P, respectively. There are also some impurity peaks of phosphorus present. Fig. 2b–e also reveal that the crystallinity decreases for the samples with an increased concentration of Bi2WO6. This decrease in crystallinity can be ascribed to the formation of probable defects as a result of ball milling and the resulting hybridization between Cu3P and Bi2WO6.30 It is known that, during ball milling, materials undergo plastic deformation due to the applied stresses and strains. This deformation leads to crystal lattice distortion along with the formation of defects inside the particles, which further decreases the activation energy required for diffusion of elements, thus favouring marked diffusion of elements at atomic and ionic scales.31 In addition, a slight temperature increase occurs due to collisions between the balls and the powder material and increases the susceptibility of the mixing species to stronger and deeper hybridization in the crystal lattice. Hence, effective interfacial solid contact is expected to occur due to the facilitated hybridization by ball milling.32 An additional experiment was carried out (ESI Fig. S4†) under different mixing conditions e.g. using mortar and pestle; there was a significant difference in the peak intensities of the sample prepared with ball milling and others using mortar and pestle. It also strengthens the fact of stronger interfacial solid-solid contact between Cu3P and Bi2WO6 as a result of ball milling.

Next, we performed XPS to determine the surface chemical state and the composition of Bi2WO6(30%)–Cu3P ZBC. Fig. 3a shows low energy XPS spectra of ZBC, which clearly confirm the presence of Cu, P, Bi, W, and O. Fig. 3b shows high-resolution XPS spectra of Cu 2p, which reveal three peaks, two at 934 and 942 eV both corresponding to Cu 2p3/2 and one peak at 953 eV corresponding to Cu 2p1/2 spin states.33,34Fig. 3c shows an XPS spectrum of P 2p with a single peak at 133.4 eV, indicating the oxidation of P, possibly due to exposure to air.15,35 A peak shift is observed for P 2p (Fig. 3d) and becomes more prominent at high composite concentrations. This indicates the interfacial chemical interaction between Cu3P and Bi2WO6.36Fig. 3e–g show XPS spectra of Bi, W, and O. Bi 4f exhibited two peaks at 159.6 and 164.8 eV, attributed to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 spins, respectively, and in accordance with the literature values for the oxidation state of +3.37 Likewise, W 4f shows two peaks at 35.7 and 37.5 eV, assigned to W 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 spin states, respectively, with an oxidation state of +6.38 Lastly, Fig. 3g depicts a high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s including three peaks. Two peaks are captured at 529.9 and 531 eV, corresponding to the lattice oxygen in a chemical environment of Bi2O3 and WO3, respectively, whereas the third peak at 532.5 eV corresponds to surface-adsorbed oxygen from the atmosphere.39,40

To investigate the morphological characteristics of the synthesized composites, we used different microscopic characterization methods including field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 4a shows that the synthesized Bi2WO6 is in the form of nanoplatelets, whereas bare Cu3P is in the form of micrometre-scale particles with relatively larger sizes (ESI Fig. S5†), which would be later subjected to physical grinding into smaller particles via ball milling (Fig. 4b). It reveals that ball milled Cu3P mainly consists of nanoparticles that are densely agglomerated due to homogeneous physical grinding. Ball milling of Cu3P was limited to 15 min to ensure phase stability of Cu3P which can change to Cu metal under extended ball milling conditions (ESI Fig. S6†). Next, Cu3P nanoparticles and Bi2WO6 nanoplatelets were hybridized using an additional ball milling process. As presented in Fig. 4c and d (and ESI Fig. S7†), different samples with varied Bi2WO6 content showed no significant difference in morphological characteristics.

Furthermore, high-resolution TEM observation was carried out to further investigate the hybridization and solid–solid contact between Bi2WO6 and Cu3P, as shown in Fig. 4e and f. The Bi2WO6(30%)–Cu3P sample was investigated to identify the presence of Bi2WO6 and Cu3P phases. Both Cu3P and Bi2WO6 showed their presence in the final matrix of the composite. A lattice spacing of 0.140 and 0.165 nm corresponds to (214) and (191) of Cu3P and Bi2WO6, respectively. Moreover, hybridization was further confirmed by performing elemental mapping analysis of the Bi2WO6(30%)–Cu3P sample, as shown in Fig. 5. It can be observed from these FE-SEM and TEM images in Fig. 4c–f that ball milling played its proposed key role in homogenized composite formation of Bi2WO6–Cu3P with effective interfacial solid–solid contact. It is anticipated that these contact sites between Bi2WO6 and Cu3P will eventually enhance the final performance of the photocatalytic system. Next, EDX data were collected to calculate the molar ratio between Bi2WO6 and Cu3P. As shown in Table 1, the ratio of Cu3P:Bi2WO6 decreased on increasing the amount of Bi2WO6. In order to investigate the BET surface area of the samples, nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements were performed. Fig. 6 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm for Bi2WO6(30%)–Cu3P. According to the IUPAC classification, the present isotherm belongs to type III type hysteresis, indicating the presence of slit-shaped pores.41 It shows a BET surface area of 5.8 m2 g−1 and a pore size of 18 nm. Information on the BET surface area and pore size for all samples is presented in Table S1.† It is observed that with an increase in Bi2WO6 content, the specific surface area decreases, which is presumably attributed to the agglomeration of nanoparticles on increasing the content of Bi2WO6.42

Optical studies
UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry (DRS) was employed to measure the optical properties and the band gap of Bi2WO6 and Cu3P. Fig. 7a shows absorbance curves of all samples. Cu3P showed an absorbance peak at 820 nm, which is located in the near IR (NIR) region, in accordance with the literature.14 Similarly, Bi2WO6 showed an absorption peak from the UV region to 450 nm, with its absorption peak mainly centered in the visible region. A slight change in the absorbance and optical properties of the composites can easily be observed with an increase in Bi2WO6 content. In general, the Kubelka–Munk equation is used to calculate the band gap of Bi2WO6 and Cu3P: (1)where R is the reflectance measured through UV-DRS, α is the absorption coefficient, and s is the scattering coefficient. Here, the scattering coefficient was ignored due to its wavelength dependence.43 Likewise, to calculate the band gap of the synthesized materials, the following equation comprising the absorption coefficient and photon energy established by Tauc, Davis, and Mott was used:44,45 (2)where an n of 1/2 and an n of 2 are assigned to direct band and indirect band semiconductors, respectively. Also, h is Planck's constant, ν is the vibration frequency, and Eg represents the band gap. By substituting the values of n and the expression of α (as a form of F(R)) into eqn (2), the band gap can be estimated as shown in Fig. 7b and c. As a result, Bi2WO6 shows an indirect band gap of 2.8 eV, which is in accordance with the literature.21 Similarly, Cu3P shows a direct band gap of 1.6 eV, which is similar to the reported values.14 In addition, the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB) of Cu3P and Bi2WO6 are shown in Table 2; their positions are calculated using the following equation (shown in the ESI†): EVB = X − Ee + 0.5 Eg(3)where EVB is the estimated valence band potential. X is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductors, Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale, and Eg is measured experimentally as shown in Fig. 7b and c. It is important to mention here that EVB is also measured experimentally by using VB-XPS (ESI S8†). The experimentally measured values of EVB of Bi2WO6 and Cu3P are 3.14 eV and 1.21 eV, which are close to the theoretically measured values (shown in Table 2).

Photocatalytic activity
In order to investigate the photocatalytic performance of Bi2WO6–Cu3P composites, a solar-water splitting experiment was conducted. A 0.5 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer solution in water was used, and Cu3P and Bi2WO6 were used as the reference photocatalyst materials. The solar-water splitting performance of the reference materials and composites is shown in Fig. 8. Gas samples were collected at regular intervals and were assessed using gas chromatography (GC), both quantitatively and qualitatively. The generation of H2 and O2 gases was identified by measuring each quantity. In the case of Bi2WO6, no generation of either H2 or O2 was observed, as shown in Fig. 8. Based on the positions of CB and VB (ESI Fig. S9a†), it seems that Bi2WO6 performs the OER only because its VB potential is located at 3.02 V (vs. NHE at pH 7), which is more positive than the water oxidation reaction potential, i.e., 0.82 V (H2O/O2, vs. NHE at pH 7). However, since the reaction took place in the absence of an electron acceptor, it is almost impossible for Bi2WO6 to exhibit OER characteristics.22 Similarly, for Cu3P, which is a newly proposed single photocatalyst for solar-water splitting, both H2 and O2 were evolved, as shown in Fig. 8, and the collected amounts were 3.5 and 1.7 μmol g−1 catalyst, respectively. Presumably, the low overall water splitting efficiency is due to poor charge separation and surface reaction of pure Cu3P if we consider the ideal bandgap energy (1.6 eV) and the VB and CB of Cu3P which are sufficiently positive and negative to carry out water oxidation and reduction (shown in the ESI Fig. S9b†). Furthermore, an additional controlled experiment was also performed under dark conditions (show in Fig. 9a); no gas evolution was observed, which highlights the photosensitive behaviour of Cu3P. To check the photochemical stability of Cu3P, reusability experiments were also performed for 3 cycles (shown in Fig. 9b). The maximum retention in gas evolution efficiency (∼95%) was obtained as compared to the first cycle. After the photocatalytic experiment, Cu3P was also investigated using XPS (shown in Fig. 9c and d). There is a slight peak shift with a marginal decrease in intensity of peaks after 3 cycles. FESEM and TEM were also performed to investigate the sample morphology after photocatalytic experiment as shown in Fig. 9e and f. However, no significant difference in morphology was observed. TON is also calculated for H2 and O2 evolution (shown in the ESI†).

In order to understand the effect of composite formation in improving the overall water splitting performance, samples of Bi2WO6–Cu3P were studied as a function of the Bi2WO6 concentration; Bi2WO6(10%), Bi2WO6(20%), Bi2WO6(30%), and Bi2WO6(40%)–Cu3P were prepared and evaluated for solar-water splitting. In the Bi2WO6(10%)–Cu3P, solar-water splitting efficiency did not show any significant change according to the parent Cu3P. Similarly, in Bi2WO6(20%)–Cu3P, the amount of evolved gases marginally increased to 5.1 and 2.5 μmol g−1 catalyst for H2 and O2, respectively. By contrast, on further increasing the Bi2WO6 content, as in the Bi2WO6(30%)–Cu3P, the solar-water splitting performances were remarkably improved with a significant increase in the quantities of evolved gases, 9.3 and 4.6 μmol g−1 catalyst for H2 and O2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8. However, with higher content of Bi2WO6, e.g., Bi2WO6(40%)–Cu3P and Bi2WO6(50%)–Cu3P, the amounts of evolved gases started to decrease, i.e., 4.0 and 2.0 μmol g−1 catalyst and 3.8 and 1.8 μmol g−1 catalyst for H2 and O2, respectively (shown in the ESI Fig. S10†). These observations validate that the optimum composition of the composite is critical to obtain enhanced photocatalytic efficiency. Detailed discussion on the optimum composition to impart enhanced performance is provided later in the mechanism section after discussing possible charge transfer pathways. In particular, the sample of Bi2WO6(30)%–Cu3P was studied for reusability for 3 cycles, as shown in Fig. 10. Bi2WO6(30)%–Cu3P showed good retention in performance when used repeatedly, even in the absence of co-catalysts that commonly isolate the photocatalyst from the direct reaction site, thus ensuring its photochemical stability. However, it is generally known that Bi2WO6 suffers photo-corrosion during photo-oxidation of water.46 On the other hand, Cu3P is considered photostable by virtue of its comparatively more negative reduction potential.

Furthermore, Cu3P has already been used to inhibit CdS photo-corrosion via hybridization;17 a similar approach is implemented here, i.e., the hybridization between Bi2WO6 and Cu3P.
Charge transfer pathway
To understand the overall process of solar water splitting using a binary composite, two mechanisms were proposed on the basis of the position of the energy levels of Cu3P and Bi2WO6 as shown in Fig. 11. First, the conventional heterostructure was considered as the possible charge transfer pathway, as shown in Fig. 11a. As illustrated, the available redox range of Bi2WO6–Cu3P decreased. Furthermore, the required HER potential was −0.41 V (H+/H2O vs. NHE at pH 7) which is above the available redox range, indicating that the HER is not practical under these conditions. Therefore, a heterostructure based Bi2WO6–Cu3P composite could only show OER characteristics when the experiment was carried out in the presence of an electron acceptor.
 Fig. 11  Charge transfer pathway of (a) a conventional heterostructure and (b) a Z-scheme based composite. 
To further elucidate the mechanism of the charge transfer pathway, Z-scheme-based composites are proposed, as shown in Fig. 11b. The redox range of Bi2WO6–Cu3P significantly increased while simultaneously containing the potentials of the HER and OER within its redox range. Subsequently, upon irradiation, it can be inferred that the HER will occur at the CB of Cu3P, with a more negative potential, whereas the OER will take place at the VB of Bi2WO6 due to its more positive potential. Thus, it can be concluded that Bi2WO6–Cu3P is capable of showing solar-water splitting performance only when it follows the Z-scheme-based charge transfer pathway.
Furthermore, it was observed that solar-water splitting performance was promising only at Bi2WO6(30%)-Cu3P composition conditions. At low concentrations of Bi2WO6, i.e., Bi2WO6(10%)–Cu3P and Bi2WO6(20%)–Cu3P, there do not exist equivalent numbers of electrons and holes provided by the two materials in order to exhibit perfect Z-scheme characteristics; therefore, the solar-water splitting performance shown by these samples is similar to that of Cu3P, as shown in Fig. 8. This highlights that, at low concentrations of Bi2WO6, the contribution of the Z-scheme effect is not significant to the final performance, whereas at Bi2WO6(30%)–Cu3P, it satisfies the electron to hole ratio, and the Z-scheme effect becomes significant and can be observed in the increased final photocatalytic performance. With the further addition of Bi2WO6, however, the balance between the equivalent number of electrons to holes is disturbed again, leading to reduced solar-water splitting performance. Another reason can be that with the addition of Bi2WO6 exceeding an optimum point, the photo-activity of the Bi2WO6–Cu3P composite decreases due to a comparatively higher band gap of Bi2WO6. The proposed Z-scheme-based charge transfer mechanism is in accordance with the results of solar-water splitting, as demonstrated in Bi2WO6–Cu3P photocatalytic systems.
It is important to mention here that the proposed ZBC of Bi2WO6–Cu3P is a mediator- and co-catalyst-free photocatalytic system. Table S2† provides a comparison of various photocatalytic systems used with mediators or co-catalysts. The compared photocatalysts were all prepared using different complexation processes such as impregnation, sequential deposition, and solid-state synthesis, whereas the present system of Bi2WO6–Cu3P was designed using mechanical ball milling to impart enhanced solid–solid interfacial contact between two semiconductors. The present material showed better solar-water splitting performance compared to other mediator- and co-catalyst-assisted ZBC systems.12,36,47,48 There are two plausible reasons for this improvement. (i) It is known that the Z-scheme depends on interfacial solid contact between two semiconductors for charge transfer. For our present system of Bi2WO6–Cu3P composites, as mentioned in the XRD explanation, there exists comparatively stronger hybridization between Bi2WO6 and Cu3P implemented by ball milling which provides effective interfacial solid contact within the material. Therefore, the presence of a mediator to act as an electron-transport chain is not necessary in the present case. (ii) It is generally known that oxide semiconductors do not require co-catalysts as their valence bands are deep enough to carry out water oxidation; in the present case, Bi2WO6 fulfils this requirement with a comparatively positive valence band potential. Similar to the HER on Cu3P, co-catalysts are generally not required due to the sufficient negative conduction potential of the material, unlike semiconductors whose conduction bands are not high enough to carry out the HER.49 Moreover, since no electron mediators were used in this system, there is also no additional need for any co-catalysts to suppress the possible backward reactions. It can be explained that the improved and promising photocatalytic performances obtained with this method not only eliminate the need for any mediator or co-catalysts for this system, but also help in establishing the formation of effective interfacial solid contact between Bi2WO6 and Cu3P via mechanical ball milling, mainly responsible for this promising performance. Finally, photoluminescence (PL) was also determined to investigate the change in electron–hole recombination rate as a function of Z-scheme formation (ESI Fig. S11†). The PL trends manifest an increased electron–hole recombination rate in the composite compared to the parent Cu3P. An increased electron–hole recombination rate is generally accepted as an indicator of Z-scheme formation, which supports the validity of the proposed mechanism of charge transport, as shown in Fig. 11.50,51
Conclusion
In the present study, we investigated two scientific developments for solar-water splitting. First, the role of Cu3P as a single photocatalyst for solar-water splitting was explored for the first time due to the suitability of its energy levels. Impressively, Cu3P has shown good initial results for water splitting and would undoubtedly be a valuable addition among other single photocatalysts for solar-water splitting. It is anticipated that Cu3P can show more promising performance in high surface area morphologies. Second, a new ZBC of Bi2WO6–Cu3P was designed and synthesized using a straightforward ball milling method. The proposed composite can only show solar-water splitting if it follows the Z-scheme charge transfer pathway. The solar-water splitting performance was studied as a function of the Bi2WO6 concentration. We optimized the composition of Bi2WO6–Cu3P to show maximum water splitting efficiencies. The proposed ZBC of Bi2WO6–Cu3P is a mediator- and co-catalyst-free photocatalyst. The promising solar-water splitting efficiencies obtained using this system compared to other mediator- and co-catalyst-assisted ZBC systems highlight the role of effective solid–solid contact in obtaining this improved efficiency even in the absence of a mediator or a co-catalyst. The results further emphasize the importance of materials design based on appropriate energy level positions, which can be used as a platform for designing similar ZBC systems for various photocatalytic applications.
