    , Accepted 31st July 2014First published on 31st July 2014AbstractIntegration of gold and titania in a nanoscale core/shell architecture can offer large active metal/semiconductor interfacial areas and avoid aggregation and reshaping of the metal nanocrystal core. Such hybrid nanostructures are very useful for studying plasmon-enhanced/enabled processes and have great potential in light-harvesting applications. Herein we report on a facile route to (gold nanocrystal core)/(titania shell) nanostructures with their plasmon band synthetically variable from ∼700 nm to over 1000 nm. The coating method has also been applied to other mono- and bi-metallic Pd, Pt, Au nanocrystals. The gold/titania nanostructures have been employed as the scattering layer in dye-sensitized solar cells, with the resultant cells exhibiting a 13.3% increase in the power conversion efficiency and a 75% decrease in the scattering-layer thickness. Moreover, under resonant excitation, the gold/titania nanostructures can efficiently utilize low-energy photons to generate reactive oxygen species, including singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals.

Broader context
Titania is one of the most important semiconductors. It has been extensively studied for a variety of applications ranging from photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and electrochromism to biological sciences by virtue of its low toxicity, biological compatibility, chemical and thermal stability, resistance to photocorrosion, and relative abundance. However, the photocatalytic activity of titania is limited to the ultraviolet region. To extend its photoresponse to the visible and even near-infrared regions, many methods have been developed. The extension of the light absorption of titania to long wavelengths and the obtained absorption coefficients in the extended spectral regions by most of these methods have remained to be limited. Plasmonic metal nanocrystals possess large absorption/scattering cross-sections and can strongly focus light close to the metal surface. They can therefore broaden and enhance the light absorption of titania through scattering, absorption enhancement, sensitization, and hot-electron injection. In this regard, we have developed a facile route to the synthesis of (noble metal nanocrystal core)/(titania shell) nanostructures and applied them to dye-sensitized solar cells as well as to the generation of reactive oxygen species to enhance the photoresponse of titania in the visible and near-infrared regions.

Introduction
Titania is an important oxide semiconductor. It is widely studied for applications on catalysis,1 solar cells,2 photochromism,3 photocatalytic water splitting4 and degradation of organic pollutants,5 owing to its low toxicity, chemical and thermal stability, resistance to photocorrosion, and relative abundance.6 However, for photo-driven applications, its photoresponse is limited to the ultraviolet region because of its wide band gap around 3.2 eV. To extend its photoresponse to the visible and even near-infrared regions, methods, such as doping with metal or non-metal elements,7 introducing disorder,8 sensitizing with organic dyes,9 and coupling with other semiconductors,10 have been developed. For most of these methods, the photoresponse of TiO2 can only be extended slightly to the visible region. In addition, the obtained absorption coefficient in the extended spectral region is generally small.
Plasmonic metal nanocrystals have extremely large absorption/scattering cross-sections and can strongly focus light close to the metal surface.11–13 They can therefore broaden and enhance the light absorption of TiO2 through scattering, absorption enhancement, sensitization, and hot-electron injection.14–17 For example, Au nanoparticles have been applied to TiO2 for enhancing the photo-degradation of organic dyes,18,19 photocatalytic activity in organic synthesis,20 photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activity in water splitting,21,22 and performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).23,24 In these studies, Au nanoparticles are adsorbed on or embedded in TiO2 through molecular or electrostatic interactions. In addition, mainly spherical Au nanoparticles with plasmon wavelengths limited in a narrow range are employed. Until now, only in a few studies have Au nanorods, including colloidal22,25,26 and templated ones,27 been integrated with TiO2.
Coating TiO2 onto Au nanocrystals to form a nanoscale core/shell architecture can increase the active interfacial area between the two materials. Such core/shell nanostructures are beneficial for studying plasmon-enhanced/enabled processes and of great potential in light-harvesting applications. On the other hand, they can also protect the Au nanocrystal core from reshaping, aggregation, and chemical corrosion. Many studies have been performed on coating TiO2 onto Au nanoparticles.18,28–44 The involved Au nanoparticles are mostly spherical or nearly spherical, with only two exceptions,40,42 where Au nanorods and (Au core)/(Ag shell) nanocrystals have recently been coated with TiO2. The TiO2 shell coated on Au nanorods has a thickness of 4.5 nm.40 Neither coating the TiO2 shell with controllable thicknesses on Au nanorods nor good dispersibility of the obtained (Au nanorod core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructures has been demonstrated. Mainly three types of TiO2 precursors have been used in these coating experiments. They are TiF4, titanium(IV) alkoxides, and titanium(IV) complexes. The hydrolysis and condensation rates of these TiO2 precursors are generally fast. The coating entails delicate control of synthetic conditions and often multiple steps of reaction, separation, and surface functionalization.
Gold nanorods, compared with Au nanospheres, exhibit larger local electric field enhancements. Their longitudinal plasmon wavelength can be synthetically varied from the visible to near-infrared region.45 Herein we report on a facile and versatile route to the preparation of (Au nanorod core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructures. TiCl3, which has recently been used to coat TiO2 on relatively large metal nanorods that are templated and embedded in the alumina pores,46 is employed as the TiO2 precursor. Our coating method has been readily extended to other monometallic and bimetallic Pd, Pt, and Au nanocrystals. The plasmon band of the (Au core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructures can be synthetically varied from ∼700 nm to over 1000 nm. The controllable plasmonic properties and synergistic interactions between the metal core and the TiO2 shell make the (Au core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructure a multifunctional nanomaterial. The (Au nanorod core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructures have been shown to function as a scattering layer in DSSCs to enhance the absorption of visible light, with the resultant cells exhibiting a 13.3% increase in the power conversion efficiency and a 75% decrease in the scattering-layer thickness. Moreover, under near-infrared resonant excitation, they can efficiently utilize low-energy photons to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), including singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radicals (˙OH). Our (Au core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructures are therefore of great potential in improving the performance of inorganic and organic thin-film solar cells, functioning as photocatalysts in organic synthesis as well as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy.
Results and discussion
The (Au nanocrystal core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructures were produced by coating TiO2 on pre-grown Au nanocrystals (Experimental, ESI†). The pre-grown monometallic Au nanospheres and nanorods are stabilized with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and positively charged. They were first encapsulated with an anionic poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) layer. TiCl3 was chosen as the titania precursor because of its low rate of oxidative hydrolysis, which is assisted by oxygen dissolved in the solution from air.47,48 TiCl3 is unstable in aqueous solutions. Its hydrolysis generates TiOH2+. The resultant negatively charged PSS layer facilitates the adsorption of the positively charged Ti3+ species, which are subsequently oxidized into TiO2 in aqueous solutions at room temperature by oxygen dissolved from air. The overall coating process is illustrated in Fig. 1 using the (Au nanorod core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructure as an example.
 Fig. 1  Schematic describing the coating of TiO2 onto a gold nanorod to produce a (gold nanorod core)/(titania shell) nanostructure. For the purpose of simplification, the CTAB and PSS molecules adsorbed on the surface of the nanorod are not drawn after the formation of the TiO2 shell. 
The core/shell nanostructures produced from Au nanospheres (diameter: 58 ± 5 nm; particle concentration: 0.12 nM) and nanorods (length: 91 ± 8 nm; diameter: 32 ± 4 nm; particle concentration: 0.14 nM) are displayed in Fig. 2a–f, together with their structural characterizations (Experimental, ESI†). As shown by scanning/transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) imaging, when Au nanospheres are used, the resultant core/shell nanostructures are spherical, with TiO2 being uniformly coated (thickness: 64 ± 9 nm). When Au nanorods are employed, the produced core/shell nanostructures are rod-like with narrow size distributions. The TiO2 shell is relatively uniform in thickness (53 ± 6 nm) around the nanorod core in each nanostructure and among the different ones. The TiO2 shell is in close contact with the Au core and appears rough on the outer surface. It is probably composed of tightly aggregated TiO2 nanoparticles.

(d) TEM image of the uncoated Au nanorod sample. (e and f) SEM and TEM images of the nanorod-cored nanostructures, respectively. (g) HAADF-STEM image of a single nanorod-cored nanostructure. (h)–(j) Elemental maps of Au, Ti, and O on the nanostructure shown in (g), respectively. The scale bar in (g) also applies for (h)–(j). (k) Elemental profiles of Au, Ti, and O acquired along the dashed line indicated on the HAADF-STEM image in the inset. (l) Extinction spectra of the uncoated Au nanocrystal samples (dashed lines) and the corresponding core/shell nanostructure samples (solid lines). 
The formation of the core/shell nanostructures was further verified by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging, elemental mapping and profiling (Fig. 2g–k). Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping reveals that the core is made of Au and the shell is composed of Ti and O. From the line profiles, both Ti and O have two peaks and a valley between them, while Au has only one peak, which spatially overlaps with the Ti and O valleys. These features suggest strongly a core/shell structure. The similar features are also observed from the elemental mapping and profiling on the (Au nanosphere core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructures (Fig. S1†). In addition, for the nanosphere-cored nanostructures, the plasmon peak is red-shifted from 531 nm to 580 nm (Fig. 2l). For the nanorod-cored ones, the transverse plasmon peak red-shifts from 516 nm to 529 nm, and the longitudinal plasmon peak red-shifts from 724 nm to 781 nm. The red plasmon shifts are caused by a refractive-index increase of the surrounding medium after TiO2 coating. The rising extinction background towards the short-wavelength region for the nanosphere-cored nanostructures is mainly contributed by the scattering from the TiO2 shell.49
The coating method was also applied to Au nanorods with different length-to-diameter aspect ratios, because the longitudinal plasmon resonance wavelength of Au nanorods is linearly dependent on the aspect ratio below a certain limit.45 Before coating, the longitudinal plasmon wavelengths of the Au nanorod samples are in the range from 650 nm to 890 nm. After coating, the longitudinal plasmon peak for each Au nanorod sample is red-shifted, with the peak wavelengths ranging from 700 nm to 1020 nm (Fig. 3). In addition, the average thickness of the TiO2 shell can be readily varied by controlling the reaction time (Fig. S2†), the added amounts of NaHCO3 (Fig. S3†) and TiCl3 (Fig. S4†).

(a, d, g and j) TEM images of the Au nanorod samples with longitudinal plasmon wavelengths of 650 nm, 700 nm, 838 nm, and 890 nm, respectively. Their sizes are measured to be 87 ± 6 nm by 38 ± 3 nm, 94 ± 6 nm by 41 ± 3 nm, 60 ± 7 nm by 16 ± 1 nm, and 68 ± 5 nm by 15 ± 1 nm, respectively.

(m) Normalized extinction spectra of the uncoated Au nanorod samples (red dashed lines) and the corresponding nanostructure samples (blue solid lines). The extinction spectra of the samples can be identified according to the longitudinal plasmon wavelength. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the elements and crystalline phases of a representative (Au nanorod core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructure sample. The XPS survey spectrum indicates that the nanostructures are composed of Au, Ti, and O (Fig. S5†). High-resolution XPS spectrum of Ti 2p exhibits two strong peaks located at 458.65 eV (Ti 2p3/2) and 464.5 eV (Ti 2p1/2), suggesting50 that Ti dominantly exists in the form of Ti4+. The XPS spectrum of Au 4f shows that Au exists in the metallic Au0 state. The XPS peak of O 1s is asymmetric, with a tail towards the high-energy region. The asymmetric shape was fitted into two peaks, corresponding to Ti–O (530.1 eV) and O–H (531.4 eV), respectively. The weaker O–H peak is attributed to the surface species, such as Ti–OH, resulting from the reaction of chemisorbed water with the TiO2 surface.51
The XRD pattern (Fig. S6†) taken on the as-prepared (Au nanorod core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructures shows only the diffraction peaks of gold, indicating that the TiO2 shell formed at room temperature is amorphous. The thermal treatment causes the amorphous shell to crystallize into anatase TiO2, yet the morphology of the core/shell nanostructures is retained. The crystallization causes shrinkage of the TiO2 shell as well as increases its refractive index, which further red-shifts the plasmon peaks. The thermal treatment was also carried out for a (Au nanosphere core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructure sample. The spherical morphology is retained, with a decrease in the shell thickness (Fig. S7†). The plasmon peak is also red-shifted.
Monometallic Pd and Pt nanocrystals are widely used as catalysts in petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and energy-related industries. Bimetallic Au/Pd and Au/Pt nanocrystals integrate together the plasmonic properties of Au nanocrystals and the excellent catalytic properties of Pd and Pt. Hybridization of such bimetallic nanocrystals with TiO2 can combine together localized plasmon, catalysis, and photocatalysis in one nanomaterial system, and is expected to offer great potential in photocatalysis, energy harvesting and utilization. However, to the best of our knowledge, only bimetallic (Au core)/(Ag shell) nanocrystals have been coated with TiO2 so far.40,42 We successfully coated TiO2 on six other metal nanocrystal samples (Experimental, ESI†), which are porous and cubic Pd nanocrystals, porous Pt nanocrystals, (Au nanorod core)/(discontinuous Pd shell) nanocrystals, (Au nanorod core)/(continuous Pd shell) nanocrystals, and (Au nanorod core)/(Pt shell) nanocrystals (Fig. 4). Careful characterizations with SEM, TEM, HAADF-STEM, elemental mapping and profiling, and extinction measurements confirm unambiguously the successful coating of TiO2 onto these monometallic and bimetallic nanocrystals (Fig. 4 and S8–S13†). The coated nanostructures are relatively uniform in shape and size. The morphologies of the bimetallic nanocrystals are preserved after the coating process. The monometallic Pd and Pt nanocrystals do not exhibit plasmon peaks and the plasmon peaks of the bimetallic Au/Pd and Au/Pt nanocrystals are strongly damped (Fig. S14†), because the imaginary parts of the dielectric functions of Pd and Pt are much larger than that of Au.

To demonstrate the plasmonic effect on the performance of DSSCs, we incorporated (Au nanorod core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructures (core length: 98 ± 10 nm; core diameter: 46 ± 7 nm; shell thickness: 51 ± 9 nm) in the back side of the anode (Fig. 5a and b). Such a configuration can minimize the negative effect caused by the intrinsic light absorption of metal nanocrystals and allow for the incorporation of metal nanocrystals at high concentrations for efficient light scattering. The optimized standard cell is composed of an ∼7 μm transparent layer and an ∼5 μm scattering layer (Fig. 5c). The plasmonic photoanode possesses an ∼1.3 μm scattering layer and an ∼7 μm transparent layer (Fig. 5d). The standard cell exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.22%, while the plasmonic cell gives a PCE of 7.05% (Fig. 5e). Therefore, with the plasmonic scattering layer at a thickness ∼1/4 that of the standard scattering layer, an improvement of 13.3% in PCE is obtained. The PCE improvement can be ascribed to two mechanisms. One is the increase in the optical path caused by the introduced core/shell nanostructures, which is confirmed by the (incident photon)-to-electron conversion (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 5f). Although the amount of the loaded dye in the plasmonic cell is considerably smaller than that in the standard cell (Fig. S15a†), the photocurrent generation of the former is still higher than that of the latter. The other is the reduction of the back reaction probability of electrons with I3− ions in the electrolyte owing to the thinner anode, as evidenced by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Fig. 5g). The improved DSSC performance was also verified by employing (Au nanosphere core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructures as the scattering layer (Fig. S15b and c†). The PCE is 6.80%, an increase of 9.3% in comparison with that of the standard cell. We estimated the mass and volume percentages of gold in the (Au nanorod core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructures that were incorporated in the solar cells according to their average sizes (Fig. S6†). The results are 36% and 9.4%, respectively. Our further estimation of the amounts of Au and TiO2 contained in each standard and plasmonic solar cell indicates that the material cost of the plasmonic cell is several ten times that of the standard cell. The material cost of the plasmonic cell is mainly contributed by gold, because gold is currently much more expensive than titania. Large-scale applications of localized plasmon in practical devices will require the development of low-cost plasmonic nanomaterials.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising, minimally invasive cancer treatment method. Photo-excitation of TiO2 nanoparticles with UV light is well known to produce ROS. On the other hand, amorphous TiO2 is more abundant, much cheaper, and much easier to prepare. Its photocatalytic performance has been found to be limited in the UV region.52 By hybridizing with Au nanorods, amorphous TiO2 is expected to show photocatalytic activities under the visible and near-infrared regions. We therefore employed the as-prepared (Au nanorod core)/(amorphous TiO2 shell) nanostructures (Fig. 6a) to explore if they can function as photosensitizers for PDT in the visible or near-infrared region. We investigated if they can generate 1O2 and ˙OH under resonant plasmon excitation. A semiconductor diode laser at 809 nm was used. The longitudinal plasmon wavelength of the core/shell nanostructure sample is 806 nm. A gold nanorod sample with the longitudinal plasmon wavelength at 809 nm and a hollow TiO2 nanostructure sample were also tested for comparison (Fig. 6b–d). 1O2 was monitored using 9,10-anthracenediyl-bis(methylene) dimalonic acid (ABDA) as a probe. ABDA reacts with 1O2 to yield an endoperoxide (Fig. S16a†), causing a reduction in the absorption intensity. ˙OH was detected with terephthalic acid (TA), which can react with ˙OH to generate a fluorescent product (Fig. S16b†). During the measurements, the nanostructure solution, containing the probe molecules, was kept under stirring (Fig. S16c†). The optical power density of the laser was 8.5 W cm−2. To exclude the effect of the plasmonic photothermal conversion, the cuvette was kept in a water bath maintained at room temperature.
 Fig. 6  ROS generation with (Au nanorod core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructures. (a)–(c) TEM images of the core/shell nanostructure sample, the Au nanorod sample, and the hollow TiO2 nanostructures, respectively. The measured sizes of the core/shell nanostructures in (a) are: core length, 89 ± 10 nm; core diameter, 34 ± 3 nm; shell thickness, 18 ± 3 nm. The sizes of the Au nanorods in (b) are: length, 83 ± 6 nm; diameter, 22 ± 2 nm. The hollow TiO2 nanostructure sample in (c) is made from the core/shell nanostructure sample in (a). (d) Extinction spectra of the three samples. (e) Time-dependent absorption spectra of ABDA with the nanostructure solution under the 809 nm laser illumination. In the detection of 1O2, the particle concentration of the nanostructure sample is ∼0.47 nM. (f) Normalized reductions in the absorption of ABDA at 377 nm as functions of the illumination time. (g) Fluorescence spectra of the different sample solutions containing TA. In the detection of ˙OH, the particle concentration of the nanostructure sample is ∼0.98 nM. 
When ABDA was present in the core/shell nanostructure solution, a distinct reduction in the ABDA absorption was observed when the solution had been exposed to the laser illumination for 2 h (Fig. 6e). The absorption decrease indicates the generation of 1O2. To see clearly the 1O2 generation behaviour, we plotted the absorption decrease of the strongest peak at 377 nm as a function of the illumination time in Fig. 6f, where the decrease has been normalized against the value right before the laser illumination. The absorption shows a rapid decrease and drops to ∼57% after 2 h, revealing that the generated amount of 1O2 increases with time. To verify the 1O2 generation capability of the core/shell nanostructures, five control experiments were performed, where the sole dye, the uncoated Au nanorod sample, the hollow TiO2 nanostructure sample, and the core/shell nanostructure sample were examined either with or without the laser illumination (Fig. 6f and S17†). After 2 h of illumination, the absorption of ABDA only decreases slightly to ∼90% of its starting value for both the uncoated Au nanorod and hollow TiO2 nanostructure samples. The slight absorption decrease is probably caused by the generation of a small amount of 1O2 and/or the photobleaching of ABDA under the laser illumination.
When TA was used as the probe for ˙OH, very weak fluorescence was detected for the uncoated Au nanorod and hollow TiO2 nanostructure samples after 2 h of illumination (Fig. 6g). In contrast, a more than 5-times stronger fluorescence emission was measured for the (Au nanorod core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructure sample. These results indicate that the core/shell nanostructures can effectively produce ˙OH upon plasmon excitation.
Our measurements clearly show that the (Au nanorod core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructures can effectively generate both 1O2 and ˙OH under resonant plasmon excitation. The fact that the hollow TiO2 nanostructures only generate a very small amount of ROS suggests that the plasmon plays a key role in the ROS generation by the core/shell nanostructures. The plasmon functions through a sensitization mechanism, where plasmon-generated hot electrons inject from a metal nanocrystal into a semiconductor.17 In the core/shell nanostructure, a Schottky barrier is formed at the interface between Au and TiO2 (Fig. S18†). Under plasmon excitation, a population of electron/hole pairs is generated. A fraction of excited electrons that have energies higher than the Schottky barrier can inject into the conduction band of TiO2. The injected electrons react with oxygen molecules in the surrounding environment to yield superoxide anion radicals (O2˙−), which will either react with holes in the Au nanorod to give 1O2 or react with water to produce ˙OH.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated a facile and robust method for coating TiO2 onto various monometallic and bimetallic Au, Pd, and Pt nanocrystals. The morphology of the metal nanocrystal core is preserved after coating. The plasmon band of the produced core/shell nanostructure can be tailored over a broad spectral range. Moreover, we have shown that the (Au nanorod core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructures can remarkably improve the performance of DSSCs and effectively generate ROS under near-infrared light. Taken together, our results show unambiguously that the (Au nanocrystal core)/(TiO2 shell) nanostructures can serve as a multifunctional platform for light harvesting applications in photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and nanomedicine. Our facile and versatile synthetic approach provides an attractive way for coating TiO2, a metal oxide semiconductor of wide interests in photocatalysis and solar energy harvesting, onto a variety of noble metal nanocrystals to achieve integrated as well as synergistic functionalities.

Broader context
Titania is one of the most important semiconductors. It has been extensively studied for a variety of applications ranging from photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and electrochromism to biological sciences by virtue of its low toxicity, biological compatibility, chemical and thermal stability, resistance to photocorrosion, and relative abundance. However, the photocatalytic activity of titania is limited to the ultraviolet region. To extend its photoresponse to the visible and even near-infrared regions, many methods have been developed. The extension of the light absorption of titania to long wavelengths and the obtained absorption coefficients in the extended spectral regions by most of these methods have remained to be limited. Plasmonic metal nanocrystals possess large absorption/scattering cross-sections and can strongly focus light close to the metal surface. They can therefore broaden and enhance the light absorption of titania through scattering, absorption enhancement, sensitization, and hot-electron injection. In this regard, we have developed a facile route to the synthesis of (noble metal nanocrystal core)/(titania shell) nanostructures and applied them to dye-sensitized solar cells as well as to the generation of reactive oxygen species to enhance the photoresponse of titania in the visible and near-infrared regions.
