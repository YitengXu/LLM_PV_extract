    , Accepted 21st February 2019First published on 21st February 2019AbstractHighly conductive, strong and flexible fibers are important for the realization of many high technological applications including smart textiles, flexible electrodes, and fast-response sensors and actuators. Here, we report a facile one-step method to produce highly conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) fibers that effectively removes the insulating PSS component within seconds, thereby enabling their fabrication in a fast one-step process. The highest electrical conductivity for a ∼15 micron fiber (3828 S cm−1) is comparable to that for very thin PEDOT:PSS film produced to date (4380 S cm−1 for 100 nm film). These fibers can withstand mechanical mistreatment – testing has been conducted in various environments including sonication and exposure to boiling water for extended periods. The study on the mechanism of conductivity enhancement shows that our spinning method efficiently removes the PSS component during fiber formation and improves orientation of the PEDOT chains, which facilitates efficient intramolecular and intermolecular charge transport, leading to the enhancement in electrical properties. We demonstrate that these highly conducting fibers can be used for fast response and highly sensitive touch sensors, body moisture monitoring, and long fiber-shaped supercapacitors. These results provide a scalable platform for the fabrication of highly conductive fibers with excellent mechanical properties, which are essential characteristics required for many advanced applications.
1. Introduction
Highly conductive fibers that are strong and flexible are now entering a new paradigm where they are essential for realizing various functionalities in smart textiles. While conventional fibers used in clothing keep people warm and protected from harsh environments, these fibers cannot sense and respond to the environment, track body movements, or harvest and store energy to power portable electronics.3–9 Realizing these functionalities usually requires fibers with a combination of electrical conductivity, electrochemical activity, strength and flexibility. To date, however, the challenge remains to achieve these optimal properties in a single fiber.
Inherently conductive polymers stand out as a material of choice for making multi-functional fibers and films because of their high electrical conductivity and outstanding solution processability. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is particularly interesting since it is water processable, thermally stable and can be highly conductive after the removal of excessive insulating PSS. The excellent conductivity, electrochemical activity and flexibility has enabled PEDOT:PSS to cater for a range of applications including organic solar cells,12,13 electrical energy storage devices,14–19 humidity sensors,20,21 and stretchable electronics.22–25
However, the spinning of PEDOT:PSS fibers with mechanical strength and flexibility, and high conductivity in a fast and continuous process still remains a great challenge to date. PEDOT:PSS fibers are usually produced by a wet-spinning process, where PEDOT:PSS dispersion is extruded into a non-solvent bath containing acetone or short chain alcohols for the coagulation process and fiber formation to occur.22,26,27 However, the as-spun fibers collected immediately after precipitation often show low conductivity (∼0.1 S cm−1) without further treatment, which is several orders of magnitude lower than the film counterparts.30 Various strategies have been employed to enhance the conductivity, including modification of PEDOT:PSS formulation with either organic solvents26,27 or conductive additives.14 For example, the addition of ethylene glycol (EG) to the spinning formulation has resulted in a fiber conductivity of ∼607 S cm−1. Furthermore, a higher conductivity of up to ∼3132 S cm−1 has been attained by employing hot drawing and a post-fiber spinning treatment which involves immersing short fibers in EG bath for 1 hour and drying them at an elevated temperature (160 °C) for 1 hour.31,32 This post-treatment process can significantly enhance the conductivity by removing the majority of the amorphous PSS component from the fibers and is considered as an essential protocol in spinning highly conductive PEDOT:PSS fibers. However, this additional process is time consuming and limits the production of fibers in small batches. In this regard, in order to produce strong and conductive PEDOT:PSS fiber continuously in a one-step process (and in fundamentally unlimited length), it is essential to eliminate this post-treatment process. Alternatively, the efficiency of removing the insulating PSS component (for maximum conductivity) during the initial fiber formation must be improved, and ideally be carried out during the coagulation process instead of post-spinning treatment. Table S1† summarizes the conductivity enhancement of PEDOT:PSS films after treatment with various solvents, e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), ethylene glycol (EG) and H2SO4. H2SO4 has proven to be the most effective solvent for conductivity enhancement. After treatment with H2SO4, the conductivity of 100 nm thick PEDOT:PSS film increased and reached ∼4380 S cm−1.33,34 These studies suggest that H2SO4 is a promising candidate to replace the organic solvents commonly used in the coagulation bath of PEDOT:PSS fiber spinning.
In our attempt to address these challenges, we replaced the conventional coagulation bath (organic solvents) with concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This simple modification allows for the removal of the insulating PSS component during fiber formation in a matter of seconds, thereby eliminating the need for the post-spinning treatment previously required to enhance conductivity. Importantly, the obtained fibers show improved alignment of the PEDOT:PSS crystalline domains along the fiber axis, which results in enhanced electrical conductivity and strength, with the highest conductivity (3828 S cm−1) approaching the highest reported conductivity for very thin PEDOT:PSS film (4380 S cm−1).33,34 The combination of high strength, flexibility and conductivity enabled the fabrication of a number of proof-of-concept devices for a range of applications, from using the fibers in completing an electric circuit in a fabric, to sensors with high sensitivity and fast response, and fiber-shaped supercapacitors fabricated from 24 cm fiber electrodes. This work opens new opportunities for the scalable production of continuous PEDOT:PSS fibers for practical applications in advanced textiles and flexible devices.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of spinning formulations
The PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersion (Heraeus Clevios™ PH1000, PEDOT to PSS ratio of 1:2.5, concentration of ∼1.3 wt%, and mean particle size of 30 nm) was used as the main material for spinning. The spinning formulations were prepared with PEDOT:PSS concentrations ranging from 0.15 to 2.5 wt%. A homogeneous and aggregate-free dispersion of 2.5 wt% PEDOT:PSS was prepared by concentrating the original 1.3 wt% PEDOT:PSS dispersion using a vacuum rotary evaporator at 60 °C. Dispersions with concentration below 1.3 wt% were prepared by diluting the pristine PEDOT:PSS dispersion. For P2 and P4 fibers, the formulation was prepared by mixing 0.3 g of ethylene glycol (EG) with 10 mL of spinning formulation (2.5 wt%). All dispersions were bath sonicated (Branson B5500R-DTH, 40 kHz, 70 W) for 1 h to remove the bubbles prior to fiber spinning.
2.2. Wet-spinning of PEDOT:PSS fibers
Fibers were fabricated at room temperature using a custom-made bottom-up wet-spinning apparatus (Fig. 1a). Typically, the spinning formulation was loaded into a 3 mL syringe and then mounted on a syringe pump (KDS 100 Legacy). The formulation was extruded into H2SO4 coagulation bath through a blunt needle from the bottom of the coagulation bath using spinning flow rates of 1.5 to 3 mL h−1. The fiber was passed through a washing bath of ethanol/water mixture (volume ratio 3:1) to remove H2SO4 from fiber. PEDOT:PSS fibers were dried under tension at ∼60 °C using a 250 W halogen light as heating source. The light was placed ∼15 cm away from the fiber to avoid overheating the fiber, and collected by winding onto a spool. In this process, a 27 gauge needle (inner diameter 210 μm) was used to produce the P1 and P3 fibers, and a 32 gauge needle (inner diameter 110 μm) was used to produce P2 and P4 fibers. Multifilament PEDOT:PSS fibers were produced using the same method by replacing the single needle with a 7-hole spinneret (27 gauge) and using a spinning flow rate of 14 mL h−1. The PEDOT:PSS fiber fabricated in IPA coagulation bath was prepared following the literature reported method.27

(b) Sample spool containing over 100 meters of continuous PEDOT:PSS fiber. (c) Representative SEM image of a PEDOT:PSS showing great flexibility through tight knots. 
2.3. Characterizations
The solidification process of PEDOT:PSS solution was monitored under a polarizing optical microscope (POM, OLYMPUS BX51). To study the phase separation, ∼100 μL of PEDOT:PSS dispersion (1.3 wt%) was injected into ∼5 mL H2SO4 solutions with different concentrations and the clear solutions were collected by filtration using glass fiber filter papers for further analysis. The UV-Vis spectra of the coagulation baths after spinning were recorded on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Cary 300, Agilent Technologies).
A scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss Supra 55VP) was used to study the morphology of the samples. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were acquired on a Kratos AXIS Nova instrument equipped with a monochromated Al Kα source (hν = 1486.6 eV) operating at 150 W at a step of 100 meV and dwell time of 250 ms. The SAXS/WAXS (small/wide-angle X-ray scattering) data of the PEDOT:PSS fibers was collected on the SAXS/WAXS beamline at the Australian Synchrotron (Melbourne, Australia), using 15 keV beam energy (wavelength 0.826 Å) and a Dectris-Pilatus 1M (169 × 179 mm; 981 × 1043 pixels) as the detector. The sample-detector distance was 281.1 mm. The data were integrated along the meridional and equatorial directions in the ±5° region using XMAS (X-ray Microdiffraction Analysis Software) to identify the anisotropic scattering. Calculation of the crystalline size and Herman's orientation function was discussed in ESI.† Raman spectroscopy was performed using Renishaw InVia Raman Microspectrometer equipped with an Ar ion laser with 514 nm excitation wavelength at 5% laser power. The mechanical properties of the fibers were measured using a universal tensile testing system (Instron 30 kN Tensile Tester) with a 5 N load cell. Fiber samples were fixed between the grips with the aperture size of 5 mm and stress and strain data were recorded at the extension rate of 0.5 mm min−1. The electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS fiber was measured using a source meter unit (Keysight B2901A) by the aid of a custom-built four-point probe set-up.
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the fibers were obtained using a two-electrode configuration. Two PEDOT:PSS fibers were placed in parallel on a PET foil and coated with PVA/H3PO4 electrolyte. The gel electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 10 g of PVA and 10 g of H3PO4 in 100 mL of deionized water. Then device were died in air for 12 h before testing. The reserved electrode heads were connected to metal wires by silver paste for the electrochemical tests using an electrochemical workstation (BioLogic SP-300). The CV curves were recorded at a potential window of 0 to 1.0 V at scan rates ranging from 5 to 2000 mV s−1. The cyclic stability test was performed at 500 mV s−1 for 10000 cycles.
For capacitive sensing, a capacitance (Cf) is formed between finger and electrode. The processor (Arduino uno R3) was used to recognize the change in capacitance. The humidity sensing experiment was performed using a custom-built humidity control system. The resistance of the fiber was recorded using a digital multimeter (Keysight 34461A) using a four-point probe set-up. All data were collected at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. One-step spinning of strong, conducting and continuous PEDOT:PSS fibers
In order to continuously fabricate PEDOT:PSS fiber with conductivity similar to that of its thin film counterpart, we removed as much of the insulating PSS component as possible during the coagulation process (i.e. during the fiber formation) and eliminated the EG-based post-spinning treatment process. We summarize in Table S1† the various solvents that have been used to enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films. It can be seen that H2SO4 stands out as the most effective treatment agent. PEDOT:PSS film treated with H2SO4 showed conductivity of up to ∼4380 S cm−1.33,34 This previous work suggests that H2SO4 is a promising alternate coagulation bath to replace the organic solvents commonly used in previous reports. Our initial attempts in using H2SO4 coagulation bath revealed that the conventional spinning set-up required some modifications since when PEDOT:PSS dispersion (also referred to as spinning dope) was injected from the top or the side of the coagulation bath, the fiber immediately floated towards the surface causing it to form kinks and break easily (Fig. S1†). We found that this was caused by the difference in density of the PEDOT:PSS solution (∼1.0 g cm−3, 2.5 wt%) and the H2SO4 bath (up to ∼1.8 g cm−3, 98 wt%). Further, there is an observed tendency for the fiber to float quicker with increasing H2SO4 concentration as the difference in density magnifies (Fig. S1c†).
We resolved this challenge by using a modified spinning set-up in which PEDOT:PSS dispersion was injected from the bottom of the bath (Fig. 1a). This novel approach takes advantage of the low fiber density, which allows for the natural upward movement of the fiber as it forms. Following coagulation, the fiber has sufficient strength to undergo the subsequent washing and drying steps without breaking allowing for continuous collection on a spool (Fig. 1b). We also noted that the spinnability improves with increasing PEDOT:PSS and H2SO4 concentrations (Fig. S1d†). For example, fibers with length exceeding 100 m could be easily produced with 2.5 wt% PEDOT:PSS and 98 wt% H2SO4.
We attribute the fiber formation to the destabilization and dehydration of the PEDOT:PSS dispersion, which occurs rapidly upon the exposure of the dispersion to the H2SO4 coagulation bath. This fiber formation process is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. The H2SO4 bath can destabilize the charge balance between PEDOT chains and PSS33,34 and facilitate the removal of excess PSS from the spinning dope.
3.2. Electrical and mechanical properties of the PEDOT:PSS fibers
We investigated the effects of various spinning conditions on fiber properties. Unless otherwise noted, all fibers were produced continuously using a 2.5 wt% PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersion as the spinning dope. For as-spun PEDOT:PSS fibers spun with different H2SO4 concentrations with a residence time of 1 minute (tres, represents the time the fiber resides in the coagulation bath), the electrical conductivity were in the range of ∼228 to ∼1265 S cm−1 (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, the conductivity only increased gradually from ∼228 to ∼382 S cm−1 when the H2SO4 concentration increased from 20 to 60 wt% and then rapidly to ∼1265 S cm−1 at 98 wt% H2SO4. By increasing tres to 10 minutes, the conductivity more than doubled and reached ∼2640 S cm−1 (Fig. 2b). This fiber is referred to as “P1 fiber”. Table S2† compares these conductivity values to those reported in the literature. It shows that the P1 fiber conductivity is ∼10 times higher than the previously reported value obtained using a one-step spinning process (i.e. using isopropanol coagulation bath). This comparison table also highlights that the previously reported high conductivity values were obtained only when post-spinning treatments were used.27

(f) Representative photographs of the textile prototype made with two P1 fibers as conductive wires in both straight and folded states. 
We next investigated other spinning parameters that affect conductivity. By further decreasing the fiber diameter using a fine gauge needle (32G instead of 27G for the P1 fiber), the conductivity increased to ∼3222 S cm−1 (P2 fiber). Using the 27G needle gauge but EG added to the spinning solution, the conductivity (∼3046 S cm−1) was also higher than the P1 fiber. The conductivity further increased to ∼3828 S cm−1 when we used both 32G needle and EG addition (P4 fiber), which is the highest conductivity reported to date for PEDOT:PSS fiber. This value approaches the highest conductivity for very thin PEDOT:PSS film (4380 S cm−1 for ∼100 nm thick film).34
In terms of mechanical properties, we compare in Fig. 2c the notable breaking strength and breaking strain of the P1 to P4 fibers with that of literature reported values for PEDOT:PSS fibers. The highest values were obtained for the P1 and P4 fibers, which showed a tensile strength of ∼435 MPa (for P1) and a breaking strain of ∼36% (for P4). These values are significantly higher than literature values including those obtained for CNT-reinforced PEDOT:PSS fiber, which has a breaking strength of ∼200 MPa and a breaking strain of ∼12%.14 The P4 fiber has a recorded toughness of ∼89 MJ m−3 (Fig. 2d), which is over two times higher than graphene fiber (∼30 MJ m−3).1,35 Seven P1 fibers (each with ∼20 μm fiber diameter) displayed sufficient strength to lift a 50 g weight (Fig. S4a†). These excellent mechanical properties also enabled us to knit a free-standing textile prototype using a manual knitting machine (Fig. S4b†).
It is also noteworthy that our PEDOT:PSS fibers showed excellent durability in the wet-state, significantly better than PEDOT:PSS fibers prepared as in previous reports. The fibers remained intact upon exposure to boiling water for 2 hours and after intentional mechanical mistreatment, tests that included vigorous shaking and sonication in a vial of water (Video S1†). In contrast, PEDOT:PSS fibers spun using the conventional coagulation bath (e.g. acetone or isopropanol) broke easily into small pieces even with gentle shaking (Video S2†). The improved durability of the wet-state fibers may be attributed to the strong interconnection between PEDOT chains as a result of eliminating the excess PSS. This qualitative assessment of the wet-strength of the as-spun fibers shows great promise for future studies to understand how the fiber properties will change when used in wet conditions such as in wearable applications. Our fibers are also highly flexible and can be knotted and twisted easily without breaking (Fig. 1c). Moreover, the fiber retained ∼91% of its original conductivity and ∼84% of its strength after repeated bending at 180° for 2000 times (Fig. 2e). Fig. 2f demonstrates the applicability of the fibers in textile-based applications showing a woven fabric with manually stitched P1 fibers used as flexible conductive wires that complete an electrical circuit for lighting three light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
3.3. Understanding the origin of enhancements in electrical and mechanical properties
For the PEDOT:PSS films reported in literature, the enhancement in conductivity was achieved by immersing dried PEDOT:PSS film into concentrated H2SO4 solution (as post-film preparation treatment). In this process, the dissolution of excess PSS in H2SO4 solution and the subsequent crystallization of PEDOT:PSS nanofibrils enhanced the conductivity.34,36 However, the fiber spinning process reported here is quite different to the dried film treatment since PEDOT:PSS is exposed to H2SO4 while still in its dispersed state where PSS can diffuse out relatively easily than when already in the dried state in the case of post-film preparation treatment. We carried out several experiments to investigate how PSS diffuses out of the PEDOT:PSS dispersion upon exposure to H2SO4 during fiber formation. In the first instance, we poured an excess amount of concentrated H2SO4 solution (98 wt%) onto a drop of PEDOT:PSS dispersion (1.3 wt%) on a glass substrate. We observed that the dispersion immediately solidified into a dendritic soft gel (Fig. S5†). Polarized optical microscopy (POM) observations of the solidified component revealed the formation of self-assembled dendritic structures and the intense birefringent area overlapped with these dendritic structures (Fig. S5c and d†), suggesting formation of highly ordered self-assembled domains. We also examined the coagulation process during fiber spinning under POM. We noted that upon extrusion of PEDOT:PSS into H2SO4 solution, the initial fiber consisted of a bright shell layer around the fiber (Fig. S6a†). In contrast, this bright shell was not observed for the PEDOT:PSS fiber prepared using an IPA coagulation bath (Fig. S6b†). The PEDOT:PSS fibers spun using a H2SO4 bath showed strong birefringence (Fig. S6c†) compared to fibers spun using isopropanol bath (Fig. S6b†), suggesting the presence of highly ordered domains in fibers from H2SO4 bath.
UV-Vis analysis of the H2SO4 bath (after spinning) showed strong absorption around ∼226 nm (ref. 37) (Fig. S2a†), which confirmed the presence of PSS that diffused out of the PEDOT:PSS fiber (as it forms) and dissolved in H2SO4. Also, this PSS concentration increased with H2SO4 concentration and with tres of the fibers in H2SO4 bath (Fig. S2b and c†). The consequent decrease of PSS content in the fibers was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Fig. S7†). These results confirmed that the efficiency of PSS removal from the spinning dope is dependent upon H2SO4 concentration and tres.
To understand how these processes affect the crystallinity and chain orientation of the PEDOT:PSS, we compared the SAXS/WAXS 2D scattering patterns of PEDOT:PSS fibers prepared in IPA bath (PIPA) and in 98 wt% H2SO4 bath (P10s). We used a tres of 10 seconds for both samples. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the intensity of the scattering ring at qy = 1.22 Å−1 attributed to PSS is lower for P10s compared to that of PIPA confirming the reduction of PSS component in the P10s fiber (i.e. dissolution of PSS in H2SO4 bath). By prolonging the tres to 10 min (P1 fiber), it showed a negligible scattering ring for PSS. There is also a strong scattering at qy = 1.82 Å−1, which is be attributed to the π–π lamella stacking of PEDOT crystals.34,38–41

SAXS/WAXS patterns for different fibers along the (d) qy and (e) qx directions marked as dashed line areas in (a). (f) Schematic representation of the proposed structural models of aligned PEDOT:PSS crystals in the PEDOT:PSS fibers. 
By integrating the 2D scattering patterns along the qy and qx directions (Fig. 3d and e), we observed significant differences in the qy direction at qy < 0.5 Å (2θ < 4.5°) among the three samples. For PIPA, the (100) peak at 1.92° is attributed to the ordering distance of alternating PEDOT and PSS chains. The d(100) of 24.7 Å is close to the sum of the chain widths of PEDOT (∼7.5 Å) and PSS (∼15.5 Å).38 For the P10s and P1 samples, a new peak at 2θ = 3.64° (qy = 0.48 Å−1, d = 13.0 Å) is observed. This distance is approximately equivalent to the width of two PEDOT chains, indicating that most PSS in the interspace between PEDOT crystalline domains have been removed. Applying the Scherrer equation to the (010) peak revealed that the size of the PEDOT crystalline domain along the lamellar stack increased from ∼2.23 nm for the P10s fiber to ∼2.36 nm for the P1 fiber. Notably, the highly ordered crystallinity structure of P1 normally appears only in the vapor-phase polymerized PEDOT films.42–44
We also calculated the Herman's orientation factor (f) to assess the PEDOT chain axis orientation relative to the fiber axis and observed that f increased from 0.65 for P10s to 0.77 for P1; f = 1 represents perfectly aligned chains in the fiber direction (see ESI for calculations†). These results indicate that the PEDOT chains are aligned along the fiber axis. For comparison, the hot-drawn and EG-treated PEDOT:PSS fibers have an f of 0.73.32 In addition to the compositional changes during the spinning process discussed above, the use of H2SO4 as a coagulation bath led to an increase in the size of crystalline domains of PEDOT in the fiber and enhanced polymer chain orientation along the fiber axis (as illustrated in Fig. 3f).
To understand the influence of different baths on the doping level of PEDOT:PSS, we recorded the Raman spectra of PIPA and P10s fibers (Fig. S8†). A Raman shift was observed for the CαCβ(–O) symmetrical stretching vibration at ∼1431 cm−1 for the P10s fiber, which indicated the conversion of PEDOT chains from quinoid to benzoid structure (i.e. de-doping).45,46 The full width at half maximum (FWHM) for this vibration also decreased from ∼63.9 cm−1 for PIPA to ∼47.8 cm−1 for P10s, suggesting an increase in the crystalline order and phonon lifetime.47,48 By monitoring the peak changes with increasing H2SO4 concentration, it revealed that the de-doping level increased with H2SO4 concentration (Fig. S8b†). The decrease in peak intensity ratio between ∼1435 cm−1 and ∼990 cm−1 (attributed to PEDOT and PSS chains, respectively) further confirmed that the removal of PSS during fiber formation is dependent upon H2SO4 concentration.
Taking all these evidences into account, we propose that the coagulation of PEDOT:PSS dispersion begins with the destabilization of the charge-balance between the positively charged PEDOT and the negatively charged PSS once exposed to the H2SO4 coagulation bath. As suggested by previous studies,34,39 the concentrated H2SO4 undergoes autoprotolysis, where two H2SO4 molecules lead to H3SO4+ and HSO4−. Consequently, the negatively charged PSS are replaced by HSO4− and are then dissolved into the coagulation bath. The strong π–π stacking of PEDOT induces self-assembly of PEDOT networks, which enhances the alignment of PEDOT crystalline domains. Meanwhile, the highly concentrated H2SO4 absorbs water from the solution, leaving behind a partially dried fiber. The H2SO4 and excess amount of PSS are then removed during the washing step. The sharp increase in conductivity with H2SO4 concentration above 60 wt% could be related to the enhanced removal of PSS during coagulation. XPS data (Fig. S7†), along with Raman (Fig. S8†) and SAXS/WAXS results (Fig. 3) confirmed that the residual amount of PSS in the fiber significantly dropped when the concentration of H2SO4 increased from 60 wt%. These results are in agreement with previous reports on PEDOT:PSS films,34,39 which showed a rapid increase in conductivity with H2SO4 concentration.
3.4. Versatile applications of the PEDOT:PSS fibers
Here we demonstrate how the outstanding conductivity and mechanical properties of the PEDOT:PSS fibers can enable various proof-of-concept applications such as soft electronic circuits, sensing, and energy storage. Fig. 2d shows the use of PEDOT:PSS fiber as an electrical circuit, which displays its application as a soft and flexible conductive thread alternative to metal wire. We also demonstrate their use as capacitive touch sensors (Fig. 4a). In this example, the integrated PEDOT:PSS fiber in Fig. 4b has an initial capacitance (C0) of ∼20 pF. A capacitance (Cf ∼ 40 pF) is generated when the finger (or any part of the body) approaches the fiber (Fig. S9†). Up to ∼200% increase in capacitance was measured upon touching with a response as fast as ∼20 milliseconds (Fig. 4c). We also weaved four PEDOT:PSS fibers (each ∼4 cm long) onto a cotton fabric with a separation distance of ∼1.5 cm between each fiber. This touch sensor could distinguish different touch patterns as demonstrated by lighting the corresponding LEDs connected to the fiber (Fig. 4d).

We also demonstrate the PEDOT:PSS fiber as a humidity sensor. In this example, the fiber sensor was mounted on a four-point probe unit and the length-normalized resistance (Rl) was monitored at each relative humidity (RH) (Fig. S10a†). As shown in Fig. 5a, Rlvs. exposure time in RH of 19% and 53% revealed that the response time was ∼3 seconds, which is faster than that for PEDOT:PSS films (typically >10 s).49,50 Additionally, the Rl values are stable at various RH suggesting balanced water absorption and evaporation rates (Fig. 5b). We observed that Rl increased linearly between 19 and 67% RH with a regression coefficient of 0.9994 (Fig. 5c). It is also remarkable that the sensing behavior (stability and response rate) of the fiber was unaffected even after it was fully wetted with water and then dried repeatedly for up to 10 times. The observed decrease of resistance with increasing humidity is attributed to the increased charge carrier density due to the adsorption of water molecules with large dipole moment.49,50 Furthermore, a stable sensing response was observed when cycled between 31 to 53% RH for 100 times (Fig. S10b†).

We also used the fibers as electrodes to fabricate fiber-shaped supercapacitors (FSCs). Unlike presently reported FSCs that use short fibers (less than 3 cm),17,51–55 our FSCs were made using long fibers (up to 24 cm). This fiber length was possible because of their very high electrical conductivity. Two PEDOT:PSS fibers are laid parallel on a supporting substrate prior to electrolyte coating, which forms symmetric supercapacitors. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves taken at 5 mV s−1 (current normalized to FSC length) are rectangular in shape with very minimal distortion even when the fiber electrode reached 24 cm (Fig. 6a). The length capacitance (Cl) remained relatively unchanged with increasing length from 0.69 mF cm−1 (1 cm) to 0.53 mF cm−1 (24 cm) The total device capacitance increased with fiber length from 0.69 to 12.2 mF (for 1 to 24 cm, respectively) (Fig. 6b) suggesting excellent capacitance retention with increasing device length. We also studied the scan rate dependence of various FSCs (Fig. 6c) and observed that all devices performed well for scan rates of less than 50 mV s−1. For instance, the 12 cm long FSC showed only a slight decrease in the Cl from 0.59 to 0.48 mF cm−1 (70.5 to 56.1 F cm−3 for volumetric capacitance) when the scan rate was increased from 5 to 50 mV s−1. In addition, the FSCs were highly stable and showed ∼95.7% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles at 50 mV s−1 (Fig. 6d). Our results suggest that the highly conducting PEDOT:PSS fibers are promising in achieving long FSCs without compromising the length capacitance performance of the device.

4. Conclusions
We have shown for the first time a facile production of PEDOT:PSS fibers with very high electrical conductivity (up to ∼3828 S cm−1) approaching the highest value reported for 100 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS films. The use of H2SO4 as coagulation bath and modifications of the wet-spinning configuration enabled the simultaneous fast removal of PSS (i.e. within seconds) and alignment of PEDOT chains during fiber formation. The PEDOT:PSS fibers have sufficient high wet-strength to withstand the mechanical mistreatment during fiber production and the dry fibers showed excellent tensile strength of ∼434.8 MPa and a breaking strain of ∼25.4%. As demonstrated by a number of proof-of-concept devices, the pronounced conductivity and mechanical strength bring new opportunities to the PEDOT:PSS fibers, including fast sensing, moisture monitoring, and fiber supercapacitors with longer lengths than previous works. The results presented here provide a new platform towards the understanding and better design of conductive fibers for advanced applications in small flexible and wearable devices. Additionally, efforts are required in developing environmentally friendly methods or use of alternative agents that are as effective as H2SO4 in enhancing the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS fibers.
