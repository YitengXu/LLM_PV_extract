    , Accepted 11th February 2020First published on 11th February 2020AbstractHighly efficient, stable, selective and durable photocatalysts for CO2 reduction systems are important to address the shortages of energy sources and carbon resources and to solve the global warming problem. Here, we report Pt–AuNPs@SiO2-mediated efficient full-spectrum photo-conversion of CO2 to HCOOH at room temperature. Three different morphologies of AuNPs with different controlled SiO2 shell thicknesses were prepared. Stabilization of the silica shell was achieved by embedding with PtNPs, which are an excellent co-catalyst with high selectivity for CO2 reduction. The prepared Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanocomplex showed high efficiency, with 1.79% quantum yield and 3.07% chemical yield for CO2 photo-conversion under visible light irradiation. The results highlighted the role of SiO2 and the embedding of Pt nanoparticles, which broadened the surface plasmon resonance band of the core AuNPs and enhanced the photoconversion efficiency. Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 demonstrated excellent colloidal, morphological, and photocatalytic stability, with 10 reaction recycles and a shelf-life of at least six months.
1. Introduction
The enormous emission of CO2 in the atmosphere (3 gigatons/month) is leading to a dangerous temperature increase (the highest in the last 800000 years).1 The sunlight-driven conversion of CO2 is a promising green strategy to convert carbon dioxide into useful chemicals and address the issues of global warming,2–4 limited supply of fossil fuels5,6 and energy storage problems.7–9 Because visible light accounts for ∼50% of total solar energy,10,11 the advancement of the synthesis of photo-catalysts utilizing visible light is the main area from a practical application point of view.12,13 From this perspective, metal nanocomplex-assisted photocatalytic CO2 conversion systems have attracted attention as potential components of artificial photosynthesis because of their activity and selectivity, which can be manipulated by tuning their size, composition, and morphology.14 Plasmonic noble metal (Ag, Au, Cu, Pt) nanoparticles can strongly absorb visible light15–17 due to their localized surface plasmon resonance, which can be tuned by varying their morphology and surroundings.18–21
Recently, the surface plasmon resonance of gold nanoparticles has been applied to visible light-responsive photoconversion processes22,23 because plasmonic nanoparticles can also function as electron traps and active reaction sites.24–26 However, the transportation of hot electrons from the plasmonic nanoparticles and the simultaneous creation of electron–hole pairs are crucial factors.22,27,28 Also, plasmon-assisted CO2 reduction involves a two-step mechanism: the emergence of hydrogen in the first step and the reaction of hydrogen with CO2 to form HCOOH in the last step.29–31 Therefore, a nanolayer of a dielectric photovoltaic material, which is helpful for hydrogen ion generation, on plasmonic nanoparticles can efficiently enhance their CO2 photoconversion due to their thermal stability, optical transparency in the visible spectral region, and chemical inertness. Silica is naturally abundant and possesses both high fabrication processability as a semiconductor and excellent efficiency for H2 generation when illuminated in water;32–34 it may play a promising role in the utilization of solar energy when combined with plasmonic nanoparticles for CO2 photoreduction. Also, SiO2 as a protective interlayer can protect the Au core from oxidization and effectively tune the localized surface plasmon resonance of Au. Additionally, due to the inertness and optical transparency of SiO2 in the UV-visible-NIR wavelength range, it is more attractive and interesting.35 Moreover, because of its typical surface chemistry, silica can be engineered36 for photocatalytic applications to prevent decay in its performance as a visible-light photocatalyst.33 Recently, many strategies, such as silicon nanowires,33,34 silica with TiO2 (ref. 32 and 37) or Pt,38 gold with dendritic fibrous silica,39 and double-shell (Ag@SiO2@TiO2 or CdS@SiO2–Au@SiO2)40,41 or triple shell (Ag@Fe3O4@SiO2@TiO2),42 have been applied to improve photocatalytic efficiency. However, silica-coated plasmonic nanomaterials with different morphologies have not been explored yet for CO2 photoreduction. Moreover, the long-term stability of the silica layer on the metal nanoparticles is a major concern. However, the issues of aqueous, chemical and hydrothermal stability have been addressed before.43 Additionally, for high performance in terms of photoconversion efficiency, selectivity and resistance to deactivation, silica-coated plasmonic nanoparticles should be attached to a material that has high selectivity for CO2 reduction.29,44 The noble metals, in this case, have high selectivity for CO2 reduction; also, the combination of silica with a noble metal such as Pt can enhance the H2 generation.34 Moreover, in comparison, Pt nanoparticles are the most efficient co-catalysts in photocatalytic reactions.45 Therefore, the colloidal hybrid nanostructure composed of plasmonic nanoparticles as the core material along with the silica layer (efficient in hydrogen ion production) and Pt (82% selectivity for CO2 reduction and excellent electron consumption)46 may be an attractive solution for high-performance photo-conversion of CO2 in the whole solar spectrum region.
In the present work, the issues of long-term stability of the silica layer on gold nanoparticles with different morphologies along with the effects of the silica shell thickness and the attachment of the co-catalyst on the stabilization and activity of photocatalysts are addressed. We report monodisperse ultra-small platinum nanoparticles embedded with SiO2-coated gold nanoparticles (Pt–AuNPs@SiO2) as an efficient, highly stable, and recyclable photo-catalyst for CO2 photo-conversion to HCOOH using visible and near-infrared light in aqueous medium.
Experimental section
One-pot synthesis of SiO2-coated gold nanostructures
In the first step, 10 mL of AuNPs (O.D. = 2.0) were mixed with 500 μL of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (0.1 M) and stirred for 3 h at room temperature. Then, 50 μL of NaOH solution (0.1 M) was added, and the mixture was stirred for another 15 to 20 min. Lastly, 2 mL of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) solution (20 μL TEOS + 8 mL distilled water) was added dropwise, and the resulting mixture was stirred overnight. After that, the resulting mixture (AuNPs@SiO2) was washed twice with ethanol and re-dispersed in 10 mL of ethanol. TEM analysis suggested that an 8 to 10 nm thick layer of SiO2 formed on the AuNPs (Fig. S3B, ESI†). To increase the silica shell thickness to 15 nm and 20 nm, 7 mL and 5 mL of AuNPs (O.D. = 2.0) were used, respectively (Fig. S3C and D, ESI†). For a lower silica shell thickness, i.e. 5 nm, 15 mL of AuNPs (O.D. = 2.0) were used (Fig. S3A, ESI†). For higher silica shell thicknesses, the relative amount of TEOS solution was increased. The method of TEOS solution addition is the most important factor to vary the thickness of the silica shell. Direct addition (in one portion) of the TEOS solution was not suitable to control the thickness of the silica shell because the addition of 2 mL to 6 mL of TEOS solution resulted in the same silica shell thickness of 10–12 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†). The same method was used to coat AuNSs (gold nanostars) and AuNRs (gold nanorods). However, in the case of AuNRs, a 3 times lower amount of TEOS solution was used.
Preparation of AuNPs@Pt nanoparticles
Pt nanoparticles (2 to 3 nm)-decorated AuNPs were prepared by adding ascorbic acid (1.2 mL) to the AuNPs solution (20 mL, O.D. = 1.0), along with 180 μL of 0.01 M H2PtCl6·6H2O and 180 μL of 0.01 M HCl. After addition, the reaction mixture was placed undisturbed for 12 h at 28 °C; then, the mixture was centrifuged (8000 rpm/15 min) and the nanoparticles were re-dispersed in distilled water (20 mL).
Preparation of Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles
Pt nanoparticles (2 to 3 nm) were decorated uniformly on AuNPs@SiO2 by adding ascorbic acid (1.2 mL) to the APS-modified AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticle solution (20 mL, O.D. = 1.0), along with 180 μL of 0.01 M H2PtCl6·6H2O and 180 μL of 0.01 M HCl. After addition, the reaction mixture was placed undisturbed for 12 h at 28 °C and then centrifuged (7000 rpm/15 min); the resulting nanoparticles (Pt–AuNPs@SiO2) were re-dispersed in distilled water (20 mL). There was a redshift in the UV spectrum from 528 nm (black line) to 540 nm (red line) when the AuNPs were coated with the SiO2 shell (AuNPs@SiO2, Fig. S2G†), and a further redshift from 540 to 553 nm (blue line) was observed when the PtNPs were decorated over the AuNPs@SiO2 (Fig. 2B). The addition of APS is a crucial step for even and uniform embedding of PtNPs on the AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles. The surface of the AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles is highly negatively charged (zeta potential = −57.4), which resulted in an uneven coating of PtNPs, as shown in Fig. S6A (ESI†). The APS addition lowered the zeta potential to −33.8 and helped to embed the PtNPs uniformly, as shown in Fig. 2C and S6B of the ESI† (detailed procedures are given in Sections 2.1–2.6, ESI†).

Photo-conversion of CO2
In a typical photo-conversion reaction of CO2, the solution of nanoparticles (10 mL, OD at 553 nm = 1.0) was placed in a Pyrex glass reactor (window diameter = 10 mm) equipped with a water circulation jacket to maintain the reaction temperature at room temperature. Then, the CO2 was purged into the nanoparticle solution for 30 min until saturation (0.24 mg mL−1). A Xe lamp (power density: 6 W cm−2) was used for visible light irradiation, whereas an 808 nm laser (3 W cm−2) was used as a source of NIR light irradiation.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of silica-coated gold nanoparticles for CO2 reduction
Gold nanoparticles with spherical shapes (AuNPs, λmax = 528 nm, 30 nm), star shapes (AuNSs, λmax = 669 nm, 30 nm), and rod shapes (AuNRs, λmax = 721 nm, 30 nm) were prepared by simple colloidal methods (Fig. S2A–C, ESI†). The TEM images of AuNPs@SiO2, AuNSs@SiO2, and AuNRs@SiO2 showed amorphous silica shell thicknesses of 10–12 nm (Fig. 1A–C and S2D–F, ESI†). The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping images of the AuNPs@SiO2, AuNSs@SiO2 and AuNRs@SiO2 nanoparticles also confirmed the silica coating on the AuNPs, AuNSs, and AuNRs (Fig. 1D–F). The UV-visible spectra showed a redshift from 528 nm to 540 nm, a blue shift from 669 nm to 655 nm, and a redshift from 721 nm to 724 nm in the cases of AuNPs@SiO2, AuNSs@SiO2, and AuNRs@SiO2 (Fig. S2G–I, ESI†), respectively. The blue shift in the case of AuNSs@SiO2 was because of the change in the morphology of the AuNSs after silica coating (Fig. S2B and E, ESI†).
To determine the most suitable morphology of AuNPs for silica coating and CO2 photoreduction, the prepared AuNPs, AuNSs, AuNRs, AuNPs@SiO2, AuNSs@SiO2, and AuNRs@SiO2 nanoparticles were then tested for CO2 photoreduction in visible light and NIR light, and their quantum yields (QY) and chemical yields (CY) of formic acid were compared. The typical CO2 photoreduction reaction was carried out using a prepared solution of nanoparticles (10 mL, optical density (OD) = 1.0) saturated with CO2 (0.24 mg mL−1) in a Pyrex glass reactor with a continuous water circulation unit to maintain the reaction temperature. An Xe lamp (power density: 5.75 W cm−2) was used as a source of visible light, whereas an 808 nm near-infrared laser (2.95 W cm−2) was used as a source of NIR light (Fig. S1, ESI†). The bare AuNPs and AuNRs did not show any observable yields; however, the AuNSs showed 0.11% quantum yield and 0.19% chemical yield. On the other hand, AuNSs@SiO2 showed the highest efficiency (QY = 0.67%, CY = 1.14%) in visible light compared to AuNPs@SiO2 (QY = 0.54%, CY = 0.92%) and AuNRs@SiO2 (QY = 0.26%, CY = 0.44%) for formic acid formation (Fig. 1G). The AuNSs@SiO2, AuNPs@SiO2, and AuNRs@SiO2 nanoparticles showed 56%, 54% and 26% of fold changes in quantum yield and 95%, 92% and 44% of fold changes in chemical yield after silica coating with respect to the AuNSs, AuNPs and AuNRs, respectively (Fig. 1H). The lesser efficiency of AuNRs@SiO2 in visible light compared to AuNSs@SiO2 and AuNPs@SiO2 is due to the absence of a surface plasmon band in the respective region. The higher efficiency of AuNSs@SiO2 compared to AuNPs@SiO2 in the visible region is due to the broader UV-visible spectrum and higher surface area of AuNSs@SiO2 due to its branched structure.
The silica shell thickness varied from 5 nm to 30 nm to optimize the shell thickness for optimum efficiency for CO2 photoreduction (Fig. S3, ESI†). There was a rapid increase in QY from 0.37% to 0.54% when the silica shell thickness increased from 5 nm to 10 nm. However, there was only a slight increase in QY from 0.54% to 0.57% when the silica shell thickness was varied from 10 nm to 20 nm. Moreover, there was a decrease in the efficiency of AuNPs@SiO2 for CO2 reduction; the QY decreased from 0.57% to 0.48% when the silica thickness was increased from 20 to 30 nm (Fig. 1I). This may be due to the fact that the plasmonic near-field enhancement in the AuNPs@SiO2 structures depends on the silica shell thickness and the size of the plasmonic core, and the size of the shell thickness should not be increased more than the core diameter.47 Also, this supports the fact that a thin nanolayer of dielectric photovoltaic material is more helpful for hydrogen ion generation than a thick layer.43 Therefore, the silica shell thickness of 8–10 nm was found to be optimal because there was an only a slight increase in the CO2 photoconversion efficiency after increasing the thickness beyond 10 nm. However, the amorphous silica shell was found to have a highly unstable shelf-life; after one month, the 10–12 nm silica shell was reduced to only 2–3 nm (Fig. S5, ESI†). On the other hand, because of morphology collision, AuNSs@SiO2 (Fig. S2B and E, ESI†), was not chosen for further studies and the AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles were preferred for PtNPs coating.
Embedding of PtNPs in silica-coated gold nanoparticles (Pt–SiO2–AuNPs)
A schematic of the preparation of Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 is shown in Fig. 2A. The UV-visible spectrum of AuNPs showed a redshift from 528 to 540 nm after the SiO2 coating; after the PtNPs coating, a further redshift was observed from 540 to 553 nm on AuNPs@SiO2 (Fig. 2B). An overall increment in the refractive index of the dielectric environment caused the redshift in the UV-visible spectrum of AuNPs after embedding of SiO2 and PtNPs.48 The TEM image of Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 showed a uniform silica coating (10–12 nm) on the AuNPs and perfect embedding of the PtNPs (3 nm), as shown in Fig. 2C. The energy dispersive X-ray mapping STEM image (Fig. 3E–G) also supported the silica coating and perfect embedding of PtNPs on the AuNPs. The HRTEM analysis supported the presence of an approximately 10 nm thick silica shell and 3–4 nm sized PtNPs coated on the AuNPs (Fig. 2D). The TEM and HRTEM images clearly suggested that due to the amorphous and porous character of the silica PtNPs, they were embedded nicely and deeply through the silica layer and were even attached to the AuNPs surface (Fig. 2C and D). This may be the reason for the stabilization of the silica layer for a longer duration. The lattice fringes in the HRTEM image with spacings of 0.20 nm and 0.23 nm indicate that the AuNPs are bounded by (200) and (111) fcc planes, respectively. Also, the lattice fringes with periodic spacings of 0.19 nm and 0.23 nm correspond to Pt nanoparticles bounded by (200) and (111) fcc planes, respectively (Fig. 2D). Also, in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, spectral peaks appeared at 37.85°, 44.14°, 64.44° and 77.01°, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of the Au face-centered cubic (fcc) crystalline structure,49 respectively (Fig. S7A–C, ESI†). The presence of a wide peak at 24.85° was assigned to the characterization peak of amorphous SiO2, as shown in Fig. S7B and C (ESI†).50 Moreover, the peaks at 40.71°, 67.73°, 81.15°, and 87.43° can be attributed to the (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) planes of the fcc crystalline lattice of platinum,51 respectively (Fig. S7C, ESI†). Bimetallic AuNPs@Pt nanoparticles were also prepared for comparative photocatalytic performance analysis. The TEM image showed the uniform coating of PtNPs on the AuNPs (Fig. S8A, ESI†). The UV-visible spectrum of AuNPs@Pt showed a redshift from 528 nm to 540 nm after decoration of PtNPs on the AuNPs (Fig. S8B, ESI†). The XRD analysis spectra of AuNPs@Pt showed corresponding Au peaks at 37.82°, 44.0°, 64.23° and 77.09°, related to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of the fcc crystalline structure,49 respectively. Also, the peaks corresponding to Pt were observed at 40.57°, 67.91°, 81.17°, and 87.74° and can be assigned to the (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) fcc crystalline lattice planes of platinum,51 respectively (Fig. S8C, ESI†). BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) surface area measurement analysis was performed; it was found that the surface area of the AuNPs increased from 3.8571 m2 g−1 to 4.9660 m2 g−1 after silica layer coating and further increased to 6.2054 m2 g−1 after embedding of PtNPs (Table S1, ESI†). BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) adsorption–desorption cumulative surface area measurement analysis of the pores suggested that there was an increase in the cumulative surface area of the pores when the AuNPs were coated with the silica layer; however, after PtNPs embedding, there was a decrease in the BJH cumulative surface area of the pores. This may be due to attachment of the PtNPs to the AuNPs through the silica pores (Table S1, ESI†).

The dependences of the shape of the gold nanostructures and the silica shell thickness on the CO2 photoconversion have been carefully demonstrated (Fig. 1). The impact of the attachment of PtNPs to AuNPs@SiO2 on the stability of the silica shell the and overall CO2 reduction yield were studied in detail.
CO2 photoreduction mechanism
In a two-step reaction mechanism of CO2 photo-reduction to HCOOH, first, generation of hydrogen occurs through water splitting of the aqueous reaction medium by light illumination; then, the chemical reaction occurs between evolved hydrogen and dissolved CO2 in the aqueous reaction medium, which results in the formation of HCOOH or CH3OH.29,52 In the second step, there is a possibility of direct reduction of CO2 dissolved in aqueous medium to formic acid. The injection of hot electrons into CO2 results in the formation of CO2˙−; this then reacts with excited hot electrons along with H+ and produces surface-adsorbed HOCO*, which is a critical intermediate in the plasmon-induced reduction of CO2.53 The HOCO* intermediate will further undergo reduction to stable hydrocarbon products such as HCOOH in the present case (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the transfer of six electrons to CO2˙− radical anion yields CH3OH; however, this is very difficult compared to HCOOH formation, which requires only two electrons.53,54 Therefore, the probability of formation of CH3OH using plasmonic catalysts is low; also, in the present study, CH3OH was the minor product, whereas HCOOH was found to be a major product. To support the mechanism, two simple experiments were conducted for confirmation of the formation of H2, the reaction of H2 with CO2 to form HCOOH and the feasibility of direct conversion of CO2 to HCOOH.
First, the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles (10 mL) were suspended in an aqueous medium and irradiated with visible light (Xe lamp) at room temperature. The reaction vessel was sealed tightly from both sides, and one end was connected to an aqueous bright blue copper sulphate solution (H2 gas indicator). The detection of H2 gas generated from the aqueous reaction mixture was confirmed because there was precipitation and a change in the colour of the copper sulphate solution due to the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ and then to Cu by H2. Secondly, the reaction between H2 gas and CO2 dissolved in distilled water was carried out in the dark for 5 h at room temperature (Section 2.8, ESI†). The chemical yield for formic acid formation was calculated and found to be 0.94%, which is much lower than that of the Pt–AuNPS@SiO2 nanoparticles-mediated reaction. This may be because the additional pathways for HCOOH formation, such as plasmonic photoconversion (hot-electron-mediated direct CO2 reduction) and oxidation of CH3OH to HCOOH, were absent.55,56
Pt–SiO2–AuNPs-mediated CO2 reduction and product analysis
To procure nanoparticle-free reaction products for analysis, the final reaction mixture was centrifuged (8000 rpm/15 min) and the Pt–SiO2@AuNPs nanoparticles were separated from the final reaction products. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation was characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Further, the nanoparticle-free supernatant was basified to pH 12 with the addition of aqueous NaOH (0.1 M) solution to convert the formic acid to sodium formate. After the evaporation of water using a rotary evaporator, the final reaction product salt was analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR, FTIR and Raman spectroscopic analytic studies. The reaction product yields (QY and CY) of formic acid formation were quantified using the GC-MS and 1H NMR analysis data.
The GC-MS characterization confirmed the formation of formic acid and methanol; the peaks at retention times of 201 s and 104 s correspond to formic acid (area %: 82) and methanol (area %: 18) from the Pt–SiO2@AuNPs and, similarly, formic acid (area %: 65) and methanol (area %: 35) from AuNPs@Pt and formic acid (area %: 85%) and methanol (area %: 15%) from AuNPs@SiO2, respectively (Fig. 3B).57 The mass spectrum (Fig. 3C and D) exhibited the exact molecular ion peaks and fragment peaks of formic acid at m/z: 46 (HCOOH+), 45 (HCOO+), and 44 (COO+). In the same way, it showed peaks of methanol at m/z: 32 (CH3OH+), 31 (CH2OH), and 29 (COH+), as shown in Fig. S6B (ESI†). The formation of HCOOH through photo-conversion of CO2 was further confirmed by the typical chemical shift at 8.02 ppm (Hz) in the 1H NMR spectrum, which corresponds to the aldehyde proton (H–CO), and the chemical shift at 166.1 ppm (Hz) in the 13C NMR spectrum (Fig. 3E).29
Furthermore, the FTIR analysis of sodium formate showed peaks at 1369 cm−1, 1617 cm−1, 1706 cm−1 and 2859 cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum after 1 h, 3 h and 5 h of reaction time (Fig. 3F); these correspond to symmetric νs(OC–O) stretching, asymmetric νas(OC–O) stretching, ν(CO) vibrations and ν(C–H) stretching, respectively, and support the formation of formic acid.58 Also, Raman shifts for HCOOH at 627 cm−1 (OCO bending), 921 cm−1 (HOC stretching), 1051 cm−1 (HCO stretching), 1222 cm−1 (CO stretching), 1423 cm−1 (HOC bending) indicated the presence of formic acid, as shown in Fig. 3G.59
The Pt–AuNPS@SiO2 nanoparticles-assisted CO2 photoconversion showed high selectivity for HCOOH. However, both products (HCOOH and CH3OH) have important respective aspects. Formic acid possesses a high volumetric capacity for hydrogen storage (53 g H2 per L) with low toxicity and flammability, which is desired for hydrogen energy carriers;60 meanwhile, methanol is a useful chemical for many important reactions, such as synthesis of fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) or fatty acid amides from natural triglycerides and animal fats.61 Also, methanol has high operating power density and low pollutant emission properties, which are useful in direct methanol fuel cells.62
CO2 photoconversion reaction parameters
Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-induced hot electrons are useful in energy conversion; however, due to the femtosecond timescale, well-designed plasmonic structures that can manipulate surface plasmons are very important for the generation and transfer behavior of hot electrons. The bare AuNPs (OD = 1.0, 0.05 mg mL−1) did not show noticeable photo-efficiency for CO2 reduction when irradiated with visible or NIR light, even though the surface plasmon band (λmax = 528 nm) lies in the visible range.22,31 This may be due to the very low concentration of AuNPs and the femtosecond lifespan of plasmon-induced hot electrons. However, we observed that with the optimum thickness of SiO2 (8–10 nm) on the AuNPs, 0.54% QY was found for the photoconversion of CO2 to formic acid in the presence of visible light (Fig. 1D). Moreover, there were remarkable increments in the quantum yield (1.79%) and chemical yield (3.07%) when platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs; 3 nm) were embedded on AuNPs@SiO2 under visible light irradiation (Fig. 4A). To highlight the importance of the SiO2 shell, AuNPs@Pt bimetallic nanoparticles were also compared with Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 for CO2 reduction in visible light. The AuNPs@Pt nanoparticles showed 1.26% QY, which is 0.53% less than that of Pt–AuNPs@SiO2-mediated reduction of CO2 to HCOOH (Fig. 4A). The large surface area and excellent adsorption capacity of the amorphous silica layer63 along with its dielectric nature played pivotal roles in the increased photocatalytic efficiency of the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanocomplex. Also, in the case of the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles, the selectivity for HCOOH formation was found to be higher (82%) than that of the AuNPs@Pt nanoparticles (65%). However, the uniform embedding of PtNPs is critical to obtain optimum efficiency for the photoconversion of CO2 to HCOOH. The AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles showed 0.54% quantum yield and 0.92% chemical yield, while the non-uniform PtNPs-embedded AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles showed 0.97% quantum yield and 1.66% chemical yield (Fig. S6C, ESI†). On the other hand, the uniform PtNPs-embedded AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles showed a remarkable increase in efficiency, with 1.79% quantum yield and 3.07% chemical yield for CO2 photoconversion (Fig. 3A and S6C, ESI†). The prepared plasmonic AuNPs, AuNPs@SiO2, AuNPs@Pt, and Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles were tested for CO2 reduction in NIR light. Due to the absence of a non-resonant plasmonic absorption band, the AuNPs showed no observable efficiency for CO2 conversion in NIR light. After coating silica on the AuNPs, the AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles showed 0.1% quantum yield and 0.17% chemical yield. On the other hand, coating Pt on the AuNPs enhanced the CO2 photoconversion efficiency, with 0.25% quantum yield and 0.43% chemical yield. Further, coating the PtNPs on AuNPs@SiO2 increased the quantum yield to 0.48% and the chemical yield to 0.82% (Fig. 4B). The lesser efficiency in NIR light compared to that under visible light irradiation corresponds to the absence of a plasmon band and the lower power density of NIR light (3 W cm−2). To carry out photoconversion reactions, solar light is a practical target as the energy source. The efficiency of the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanocomplex for CO2 photoreduction was also studied in sun-light. A solar simulator was used for sunlight-driven CO2 reduction reactions. The QY and CY were calculated as 0.07% and 0.12%, 0.32% and 0.54%, and 0.21% and 0.35% in the cases of the AuNPs@SiO2, Pt–AuNPs@SiO2, and AuNPs@Pt nanocomplexes (Fig. 4C), respectively.

To further investigate the origin of the photocatalytic activity, fold changes can give a clear idea of the higher efficiency of the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanocomplex compared to the bare AuNPs, AuNPs@SiO2, and AuNPs@Pt nanoparticles (Fig. S9, ESI†). The SiO2 and Pt coatings caused 54% and 143% and 92% and 243% fold changes in the AuNPs for the quantum yield and chemical yield of CO2 reduction, respectively. On the other hand, there were 179% and 305% fold changes in the CO2 photoconversion quantum yield and chemical yield when the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanocomplex was used as a photocatalyst under visible light irradiation (Fig. S9A, ESI†). Similar trends in the fold changes were found when NIR light and sunlight were used as the source of light for CO2 reduction. However, the fold change under NIR light is much higher with Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 (48% QY and 82% CY) than with AuNPs@Pt (25% QY and 43% CY), as shown in Fig. S9B, ESI.† A possible reason is the higher NIR light absorption by Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 compared to the AuNPs@Pt nanoparticles because the optical density of AuNPs@Pt at 808 nm was observed to be 0.28 (Fig. S8B ESI†), whereas in the case of Pt–AuNPs@SiO2, it was found to be 0.62 (Fig. 2B). In sunlight, the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles showed a 32% fold change in QY and a 54% fold change in CY (Fig. S9C, ESI†). The SiO2 coating on the small AuNPs (30 nm) may have reduced the hot electron collisions and related thermalization processes because the charge carriers have short paths to the surface of Pt–AuNPS@SiO2, where the PtNPs are present and the reaction takes place. Also, the Pt–AuNPS@SiO2 hybrid heterostructure showed broad plasmonic resonance in the visible wavelength range (450–750 nm), and hot electron generation predominately takes place under plasmon resonant excitation.64 Due to the broad surface plasmon band of Pt–AuNPs@SiO2, it is significantly effective under visible and NIR light, which is crucial from a practical application point of view because visible light and NIR light correspond to 50% and 45%, respectively, of the total sunlight irradiation.12,65 The uniform PtNPs coating provided additional active sites for CO2 reduction and promoted separation of the charge carriers (electron and holes) generated by plasmonic excitation of the AuNPs. Moreover, the PtNPs embedded inside the silica layer and connected to the AuNPs surface amplify the electron transportation and endow the overall structure of Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 with morphological stability and robustness. Also, Pt is certainly known as the most effective co-catalyst, with a higher photo-generated electron acceptance rate and 83% higher selectivity for the reduction of CO2; thus, it contributed greatly to the overall increased efficiency of Pt–AuNPs@SiO2, as elaborated schematically in Fig. 3A.46,66
The impact of the concentration of the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanocomplex on the CO2 photoconversion rate was studied by varying the amount of nanoparticles from 0.025 mg mL−1 (O.D. = 0.5) to 0.5 mg mL−1 (O.D. = 10), as shown in Fig. 4D. There were linear increases in the QY and CY from 0.74% and 1.25% to 3.21% and 5.45% as the nanocomplex concentration increased from 0.025 mg mL−1 (O.D. = 0.5) to 0.15 mg mL−1 (O.D. = 3), respectively. However, the QY and CY almost linearly increased to 4.15% and 7.05%, respectively, as the concentration increased to 0.35 mg mL−1 (O.D. = 7). Moreover, there were decreases in QY and CY to 3.98% and 6.76% when the nanocomplex concentration was increased to 0.5 mg mL−1 (O.D. = 10). This may be due to agglomeration and/or aggregation of the nanoparticles at higher concentrations (Fig. 4D). The reaction time for CO2 photo-conversion was varied from 0.5 h to 5 h to observe the reaction progress with the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanocomplex (O.D. = 1.0). Reaction samples were collected from the reaction mixture regularly at intervals of 0.5 h, and the quantum and chemical yields were calculated after analyzing the samples with gas chromatography and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The quantum and chemical yields were calculated to be 0.25% and 0.425% after 0.5 h, respectively; they were found to almost double after 1 h of reaction time, where they were calculated as 0.47% (quantum yield) and 0.80% (chemical yield) (Fig. 4E). After 5 h of reaction progress, the quantum and chemical yields significantly increased to 1.79% and 3.07%, respectively (Fig. 4E).
There were linear increases in the quantum and chemical yields as the time increased from 0.5 h to 5 h, which showed the robust characteristics of the prepared Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanocomplex. It should be noted here that the concentration used for the reaction time optimization was only 0.05 mg mL−1 (O.D. = 1.0). The pH of the reaction medium is also a crucial factor on which the photochemical conversion of CO2 depends.67,68 To determine the optimal pH for efficient CO2 photoconversion, the pH was varied from acidic (4.0) to almost neutral (6.0) and to basic (9.0 and 11.0) (Fig. 4F). The quantum yields for CO2 reduction at pH 4.0, 6.0, 9.0, and 11.0 were found to be 1.28%, 1.79%, 2.15%, and 1.61%, respectively, whereas the chemical yields were observed to be 2.19%, 3.07%, 3.69%, and 2.76%, respectively (Fig. 4F). pH 9.0 (mild basic conditions) was observed to be the most favorable pH for the visible light-irradiated photoconversion of CO2 into HCOOH; this suggests that the final product (HCOOH) formation takes place through the HCO3−1 ion.67,69
There is an additional benefit of carrying out the CO2 reduction reaction in aqueous medium, i.e. water can act as a hole scavenger. However, methanol is known as a better hole scavenger as well as a source of hydrocarbon for formic acid formation.70–72 A hole scavenger prevents fast electron–hole recombination and thus improves the yield of HCOOH. Also, during photoexcitation, hot holes generated along with hot electrons can oxidize H2O to O2 or H2O2;73 however, in the present case, due to the formation of CH3OH, the hot holes preferably contributed to the oxidation of CH3OH to HCOOH (Fig. 3A).74 Due to this reason, in this regard, the impact of methanol for CO2 photoconversion to HCOOH was investigated under visible light illumination. In the presence of methanol, the quantum and chemical yields for HCOOH formation significantly increased to 2.15% and 3.66% (Fig. 5A). The plasmonic nanomaterials possess a strong photothermal effect and are expected to rapidly accelerate the rate of CO2 photoconversion reactions.75 All the parameters were optimized at room temperature by using temperature control to rule out the effects of temperature on the rate of reaction. Moreover, the impact of the photothermal effects of the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanocomplex on the CO2 photoconversion was studied by carrying out the reaction without temperature control for 30 min. The strong photothermal effect of Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 increased the reaction temperature from 25 °C to 49 °C, 67 °C, and 85 °C in 10 min, 20 min, and 30 min, respectively, under visible light illumination. The quantum and chemical yields were found to be 0.79% and 1.34% after 10 min, respectively, which further increased to 1.42% and 2.34% after 20 min, respectively. After 30 min, the quantum and chemical yields finally reached 2.54% and 4.32%, respectively, which confirms that the photothermal effect directly influences the rate of reaction (Fig. 5B).

Sustainable photocatalytic efficiency over reaction recycles along with colloidal and structural stability is an ideal condition for practical photocatalytic system applications. The Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanocomplex was recycled after 5 h of reaction and reused for another 10 reaction cycles of CO2 photoreduction in the presence of visible light (Fig. 5C). The photocatalytic efficiency of the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanocomplex was found to be consistent after 10 recycles, as supported by gas chromatography and 1H NMR analysis (Fig. S10, ESI†). There was a 0.25% decrease in the quantum yield after 10 reaction cycles (Fig. 5C), which may be due to slight particle loss during centrifugation after every round of cycling. The reusability of monodisperse nanoparticles depends on their structural and colloidal stability during the reaction process and after reaction recycling. The colloidal stability of the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles was analyzed with UV-visible spectroscopy using samples withdrawn every 1 h during the 5 h CO2 reduction reaction. The prepared plasmonic nanoparticles showed excellent colloidal stability because there was no noticeable change in the optical density of the nanoparticles (Fig. S11A, ESI†). The colloidal and structural stability were also analyzed after 10 reaction cycles using UV-visible and TEM analysis. There was no aggregation of particles after 10 reaction cycles, as suggested by the UV-visible spectrum. However, there was a slight loss of particles because the optical density of the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles after 10 reaction cycles was lower than that of the fresh sample of Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 5D). The TEM analysis confirmed the robustness of the morphological stability because there was no change in the structure of the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles after 10 reaction cycles (Fig. S11C, ESI†). The crystalline structure was also found to be stable after 10 reaction cycles, as suggested by XRD analysis (Fig. 5E).
The shelf life of the prepared nanocomplex was also studied for six months. There was no significant change in the efficiency of the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles for CO2 photoreduction even after six months, as shown in Fig. 5F. The quantum and chemical yields were calculated to be 1.70% and 2.88%, respectively. Also, no change was observed in the morphology and distribution after 6 months of shelf life, and the nanoparticles were found to be perfectly stable, as shown by TEM analysis (Fig. S11D, ESI†) and UV-visible spectra (Fig. 5D). The XRD analysis suggested a similar observation because the crystalline structure was found to be highly robust and remained unchanged at room temperature (Fig. 5E). The excellent colloidal and morphological stability of the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles is the reason for their steady performance for CO2 photoreduction.
In order to show the effects of the excitation wavelength on CO2 photoreduction and the robustness of the prepared nanoparticles, photocatalytic reactions were carried out at three different monochromatic wavelengths, viz., 450 nm, 550 nm, and 650 nm, and the quantum yields were found to be 0.25%, 0.45%, and 0.24%, respectively (Fig. S12, ESI†). The chemical yields for the same reactions were calculated as 0.42%, 0.76% and 0.41% at 450 nm, 550 nm, and 650 nm, respectively. These results agree very well with the plasmon band (553 nm) of the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 2B) and showed a maximum efficiency at 550 nm. The lower yield compared to whole visible region irradiation is due to the lower power density of light irradiation while using wavelength filters. Moreover, to verify that CO2 was the carbon source of the HCOOH generated in the photocatalytic process, isotope labeling analysis of HCOOH produced with isotopic 13CO2 was carried out using 1H NMR spectroscopy. In the 1H NMR spectrum of the CO2 photoreduction product, a doublet attributed to H13COOH was observed, with a small singlet attributed to H12COOH (Fig. S13, ESI†). The peak area of the observed singlet was approximately 1/100 of the peak area of the observed doublet, which was found to be consistent with the contamination of 12CO2 in the used 13CO2 (99%); hence, it was confirmed that HCOOH was formed by the photoreduction of CO2 and not by any other impurity (Fig. S13A, ESI†).76,77 The same pattern was observed in the 13C NMR spectrum which was measured without 1H decoupling. These results clearly show that HCOOH produced through the CO2 photoreduction (Fig. S13B, ESI†).77
Conclusions
In conclusion, three different morphologies of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, AuNSs, and AuNRs) were prepared and coated with silica shells utilizing a new, simpler one-pot route; spherical gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were found to be the most stable and efficient morphology for CO2 reduction. The AuNPs were coated with silica shells in the thickness range of 5–30 nm, and 8–10 nm was found to be the optimum silica shell thickness range with maximum photocatalytic efficiency. The destabilizing nature of the silica shell was controlled well with a PtNPs coating, which also extensively enhanced the efficiency of the nanoparticles for CO2 photoreduction under visible light illumination. After attachment of ultra-small Pt nanoparticles, the quantum yield was found to increase greatly from 0.54% to 1.79%. There was a 179% fold change in quantum yield and a 305% fold change in chemical yield for the AuNPs after the attachment of the silica shell and PtNPs for CO2 reduction. The amorphous and porous morphology of the silica shell enabled the PtNPs to be embedded inside it and directly bond with the core Au, which in turn controlled the destabilization of the silica shell and also extensively enhanced its efficiency for CO2 photoreduction under visible light illumination. Also, the attachment of PtNPs not only enhanced the efficiency of CO2 reduction but also stabilized the colloidal distribution and morphological stability. Even after 10 reaction cycles and 6 months of shelf life, the prepared Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 nanocomplex was found to be morphologically robust. Moreover, the Pt–AuNPs@SiO2 colloidal nanocomplex showed formidable photocatalytic performance under NIR light and sunlight irradiation.
