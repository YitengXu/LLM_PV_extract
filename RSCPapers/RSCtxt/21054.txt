    , Accepted 1st October 2015First published on 1st October 2015AbstractGraphenes have attracted increasing attention in a variety of scientific fields. By modification with foreign elements such as boron, sulfur, and fluorine, their unique electronic and spin structures can be effectively tuned and the substituted or decorated graphenes as promising materials have been successfully employed in electrical, optical, and catalytic fields. In this review, we summarize the recent advances of these newly derived heteroatom substituted or decorated graphenes with an emphasis on the preparation methods, applications and the mechanisms of action. We are hopeful for future developments of heteroatom substituted or decorated graphenes in precisely controlled substitution methods, and finding wide applications of heteroatom substituted or decorated graphenes in many different fields.
1. Introduction
Graphene with fascinating properties is a monolayer of carbon atoms densely packed into a hexagonal lattice. Since long-range π-conjugation in graphene yields extraordinary thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties, research on graphene has emerged as one of the most active fields. However, the absence of a band-gap in the intrinsic graphene structure makes it unsuitable for most electronic applications. Thus, opening and tailoring the band gap in graphene for specific applications is one of the most important and urgent research topics in the graphene research currently.
To date, many approaches have been developed to tune the band gap of graphene as exemplified by the formation of confined nanogeometries of quantum dots1–4 and nanoribbons.5–10 Besides the morphology optimization, one of the most effective ways to control the electronic properties of graphene is by introducing hetero-atoms into the two-dimensional (2D) graphene plane through chemical substitution. Usually, there are two means to dope graphene with heteroatoms: (1) chemically substituted doping, which implants heteroatoms such as nitrogen and boron atoms into the carbon lattice of graphene and (2) chemically decorated doping, which introduces heteroatoms such as halogen atoms to generate carbon–halogen bonds.
It has been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally that the doping with heteroatoms is a successfully straightforward way to modulate the 2D graphene's electronic network structure, increase active sites and enhance physical and chemical activities of graphenes. Both of these methods (including chemically substituted and decorated doping mentioned above) can effectively tune the intrinsic band structure of graphene, and thus may open up the energy gap between the valence and conduction bands. Previous theoretical research shows that pioneers have made a lot of progress on the doped graphene by using a first principles approach.11–23 Generally, comparisons of the theoretical results to the experimental results show good agreement. The doping-induced charge redistribution effect was extended to include other doping atoms with a higher or lower electronegativity than that of carbon, such as boron, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur and halogens. In all of these cases, it was found that the doping-induced charge redistribution, regardless of whether the dopants have a higher or lower electronegativity than that of carbon, could create charged sites (C+, B+, P+, S+, etc.).24 The characteristics of graphene electronic properties can be adjusted by the heteroatom doping through theoretical studies. But as we know, it is only applicable for some specific and extreme conditions. So theoretical approaches in comparison with the experimental approaches provide insufficient justification because of the uncontrollable doping position, a large number of random structural defects, and irregular lattice arrangement in the doped graphenes. Therefore, we are more inclined to get some summarized progress from the experimental results to guide the future work. Some of the previous publications have specifically summarized the graphenes doped with certain heteroatoms.25–30 In the current review we will systematically present the latest advances of different kinds of heteroatom substituted or decorated graphenes including graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), and their important applications in electronics, catalysis and energy-related devices.
2. Substituted graphenes
Chemically substituted doping means heteroatoms are implanted into the carbon lattice of graphene. Some research reports that various heteroatoms (boron, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, etc.) can be doped into the graphene carbon lattice to effectively tailor the properties of pristine graphene. With the clarity of classification, we provide a summary of the preparation methods of these substituted and decorated graphenes.
2.1. Boron substitution
Boron (B) has few valence electrons when compared to carbon (C), and therefore, it is expected to induce p-type doping of the graphene structure. In the meanwhile, substitutional doping also has significant effects on the chemical disorder since the B–C bond is 0.5% longer than the C–C bond.31 Theoretical simulations have been employed to study B doped graphene. Recent theoretical calculations have shown that a sufficiently high B concentration gives rise to quantum interference effects without affecting the outstanding transport properties of graphene.32,33 To model the effect of B doping on the electronic structure, lattice dynamics, and electron–phonon coupling,34–36 extensive ab initio calculations were performed in virtue of the density functional theory (DFT),11,37–44 revealing the potential of boron doped graphene (BG) in electronic devices.
For the experimental synthesis of BG, a variety of methods have been developed such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), arc discharge, thermal treatment, and solvothermal treatment of graphite oxide in the presence of borides as shown below.
In the CVD approach, the heteroatom content can be controlled by changing the flow rate and the ratio between the C source and the precursor of substituted atoms (e.g., B2H6,45 boron,46 and phenylboronic acid47 as the B source) and usually achieve p-type modification (Fig. 1). The Agnoli group48 provided a detailed microscopic view of the growth mechanism of BG on Cu foils. Boron carbide (BxCy) nanoparticles (NPs) were first formed on the bare Cu areas between graphene patches. These BxCy NPs can be postulated to be the effective B source, which can migrate by diffusion from the peripheral areas into the graphene islands. The Shen group49 not only controlled the doping density, but also well confined the location of B dopants at the desired positions in the graphene lattice to achieve patterned doping. The solid precursor was loaded into a small quartz tube with one side sealed and was placed at the gas influx side of the quartz tube. The BG obtained by the CVD method is generally thin film and even a monolayer.

The arc discharge approach has also been applied to obtain BG by evaporating the B source on the graphite electrodes50 (e.g. B2H6 and BF3·Et2O50–52) at a high temperature. The reactor was flushed repeatedly with nitrogen and the flow of the B precursor was stabilized before introducing the sample into a hot region of the reactor. Then the sample was exfoliated at 800 °C and converted to BG by pyrolysis. In addition, some groups53,54 used B-stuffed graphite electrodes directly as the B source in H2/He for a high B doping content (∼3 at%).
Recently, B doping is also achieved by thermally treating the mixture of boron oxide (such as B2O355 and H3BO356,57) or boron halides39,40 with graphite at a high temperature. Thermal treatment is also a very common and easy way to obtain doped graphene, not just BG actually, and the easily controlled doping level also makes the method very important. BG was known to be synthesized through thermally annealing GO in the presence of B2O3, where B atoms coming from B2O3 vapor can replace carbon atoms inside the graphene layers and thereby substitutionally doped into the graphene lattice.55 Similarly, H3BO3 was first converted into B2O3 accompanied by diffusing B2O3 vapor into the graphene nanosheets when H3BO3 was used as a precursor to prepare BG.56–58
On the other hand, the solvothermal reaction is also a promising approach to prepare high-quality and free-standing graphene in the presence of the reductant (e.g., alkali metal) and an organic solvent.59 The Huang group60 invented a solvothermal method with Wurtz-type reductive coupling reaction (WRC) to obtain BG by adding BBr3 to the reaction system. They got high-quality free-standing BG through the nearly stoichiometric reaction of CCl4 and K. The formation mechanism and reaction process were proposed to follow three steps: stripping-off, coupling and assembly, and layer growth. Importantly, the layer number of the as-prepared BG can be typically controlled to be less than five. Further, the Wang group61 successfully synthesized high-quality BG in large quantities from nascent C and B in the reduction reaction of BBr3 in CCl4 with an alkali metal (K) reductant. This method can conveniently synthesize single-layer and few-layer BG sheets. In addition, Park and coworkers62 mixed the aqueous solution of GO and borane–THF adduct under reflux, which induced the incorporation of a small amount of B atoms into the graphene nanoplatelets. It is the first report on the production of BG nanoplatelets from a solution process.
2.2. Pnictogen substitution

2.2.1. Nitrogen substitution. 
Nitrogen doped graphene (NG) has been intensively studied both theoretically and experimentally.26,28,65–76 Nitrogen atoms were introduced into the graphene network through various methods with different N sources. It has been well established that the incorporation of nitrogen (N) atoms into the graphene matrix can lead to three main types of N formats, including graphitic N with a direct substitution structure (quaternary N or graphitic N), pyridinic N and pyrrolic N structures.77 Among these nitrogen types, pyridinic N and quaternary N are sp2 hybridized and pyrrolic N is sp3 hybridized.71 Typically, NG can be obtained through two ways: direct synthesis and post treatment.71
First, it could be introduced directly during the graphene growth by a CVD approach, a solvothermal process,78,79 and an arc-discharge method.50 For the CVD process, a metal catalyst is usually used as the substrate, and then a carbon source gas mixed with a N-containing gas (e.g., NH3,80–83 pyridine,84,85 pyrrole, acetonitrile,86 and porphyrin87) is introduced at high temperature. These precursors dissociate and rebuild into NG by means of precipitation on the surface of the catalyst.81 Notably, the nitrogen content can be controlled by changing the flow rate and the ratio between C and N precursors. In contrast, the solvothermal approach could be employed for gram-scale production of NG.78 Specifically, by mixing lithium nitride (Li3N) with tetrachloromethane (CCl4) or cyanuric chloride (N3C3Cl3) with Li3N and CCl4, NG with different N contents was obtained, and the proportion of doped nitrogen species also changes with different reactant mixtures. The arc-discharge method provides another approach to generate NG by evaporating the C source in the presence of pyridine vapor or NH3 at high temperature. Most of the NG has two or three layers with a thickness of less than 1 nm.88
NG can be obtained via post-synthesis treatment, mainly including thermal treatment and plasma treatment.77,89–92 The most widely used method is the thermal treatment, which refers to heating graphene in N precursors (e.g., NH3) at high temperature (usually higher than 800 °C).93–100 For the plasma treatment, the initial carbon material is placed in the nitrogen plasma atmosphere, and C atoms will be partly replaced by N atoms.48,68–71 The reduction temperature has a great impact on the N-doping level and the topography of as-synthesised NG. The N content can reach around 5 at% when the reduction temperature is 500 °C.72 Recently, some groups have reported that NG can be obtained by reducing GO in the N2H4 solution or NH3 and N2H4 mixed solution.101,102 A nitrogen content of 1 at% NG was synthesized from graphene in the presence of N2H4 solution by using ultrasonication as a supplementary tool in experimentation without heating. The nitrogen species in the NG contains only pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen.103


2.2.2. Phosphorus substitution. 
Phosphorus (P) has a lower electronegativity than C due to its higher electron-donating ability, and thus new properties are expected for the phosphorus doped graphene (PG). Compared to NG and BG, the synthesis of PG still remains to be a challenge because of the relatively large atomic radius of P.
The synthesis of PG is generally based on the thermal treatment of GO with P sources.104–106 Using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BmimPF6) as the synthetic precursor, Wei and coworkers107 fabricated a porous network and silk veil waves like PG with a high specific surface area of 496.67 m2 g−1. Here, BmimPF6 was chosen as the P precursor because it is one of the most common ionic liquids, and GO powders can be easily dispersed in the solution of BmimPF6–ethanol–water with high concentration. During the thermal annealing process, PF6− is expected to react with oxygen containing groups on the plan and edge of the GO sheets to join into the carbon framework. The Garca group108 made significant contributions to the synthesis of PG by direct pyrolysis of H2PO4−-modified alginate. The alginate hydrogel with embedded H2PO4− was collected from water and pyrolyzed under an Ar atmosphere. Significantly, the obvious corrugations and wrinkles of PG originated from the intercalated P defects in the thermally reduced GO and the structural distortion was caused by the increase of the bond length and decrease of bond angles when P atoms were incorporated into graphene sheets.

2.3. Sulfur substitution
The electronic structure of sulfur doped graphene (SG) investigated by first principles calculations revealed that SG could be either a semiconductor with a small band gap (between 0.9 and 3.8 eV) or have better metallic properties than the pristine sheet.22,109 Sulfur (S) doping remains in a major form of thiophene-like S in graphene sheets,110 and is stable from a thermodynamic standpoint. Experimentally, both inorganic sulfide as shown in Fig. 2a (e.g., hydrogen sulfide, carbon disulfide, p-toluenesulfonic acid,111etc.) and aromatic sulfur have been used as S sources. SG is synthesized mainly by the thermal treatment. For example, Bandosz et al.112 introduced hydrogen sulfide into the GO matrix at 800 °C for S doping. In another report, Park and coworkers113 got SG with dominant thiophene-like S by a liquid precursor based on simple thermal treatment with carbon disulfide (CS2) vapor under the Ar atmosphere. S-content starts with 0.59 at% and grows to a maximum of 1.98 at% (850 °C) by altering the reaction temperature. The Pumera group114 used various S sources including H2S, SO2 or CS2 as S-containing gaseous environment to synthesize SG by the thermally exfoliated method. The highest S content (11.99 wt%) was found by using H2S as a precursor. It was also revealed that the type of GO derived from different synthetic methods such as the Staudenmaier method, the Hofmann method, and the Hummers method could have some effect on the properties of the final product. Yang et al.115 reported that benzyl disulfide (BDS) is used as a S-dopant precursor (Fig. 2b). The contents and bonding configurations of S in these SGs can be adjusted by varying the mass ratios of GO and BDS or the annealing temperature. The XPS results showed that the S signals in the SG arise from covalent C–S bonds. This means GO annealing in BDS led to S incorporation into the sheets to afford C–S bonded groups. Moreover, Li and coworkers116 introduced an effective way for chemically decorating graphene films by exposing the large multilayer graphene (MLG) films/Si device to SOCl2 vapors, S elements are easily doped on the films to get the SG films.

Reproduced from ref. 114, 115, and 117 with permission. 
Ball milling is one of the most convenient methods for the introduction of heteroatoms including S doping. Baek and coworkers developed a dry ball-milling method to produce edge-selective SG nanoplatelets117 with the S content of 17.84 wt% (Fig. 2c). SEM images of the resultant SG displays drastically reduced grain size (∼1 μm) with a flower-like morphology. According to the TEM images, SG has a highly crystalline and ordered structure with a honeycomb lattice in the basal area and some distortion at the edge region.
3. Decorated graphene
Decorated graphene means heteroatoms are grafted onto the graphene, rather than being implanted into the carbon lattice of graphene, which is mainly represented by the decorated halogen atoms.
3.1. Halogen decorated graphene
Halogen atoms, such as fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br) and iodine (I), are considered to be more electronegative than sp2-hybridized carbon, and they will induce a positive doping by charge transfer.

3.1.1. Fluorine decorated graphene. 
DFT calculations showed that graphite fluoride possesses a wide band gap of approximately 3 eV at the K point of its band structure, which agrees with its highly electrical insulating properties.119,120 Other related theoretical studies showed that covalent C–F bonds increase the strain in the graphene structure and cause some disorder in interlayer carbon–carbon bonds, which can further disturb the fluorination process.119 As a result, fluorine decorated graphene (FG) presents the unique properties for various applications.
So far, several approaches have been used to synthesize FG. The major way to prepare FG is by exposing graphene to the atmosphere of F, which was formed by the decomposition of HF,121,122 (Fig. 3a) fluorine gas (F2),120,123,124 (Fig. 3b) and xenon difluoride (XeF2)124,125 at a certain temperature126 or F-based plasmas.127 The process of preparation are dangerous and environmentally-unfriendly by using different fluorides as the F source. Alternatively, Ajayan et al.128–131 reported that FG can be obtained by exfoliating graphite fluorinated polymers in terms of the modified Hummer's method. A high F atom content FG was obtained by this modified method. FG with an F atom content of 23% can be achieved by using a highly fluorinated graphite polymer as the precursor (Fig. 3c).129 Besides the methods mentioned above, ultrasonication has also been used for the synthesis of FG. Fully fluorinated graphite was directly suspended in dimethylformamide (DMF) by sonication. The mixture was left in rest in order to settle down the insoluble particles, and a clear supernatant of FG was collected.132,133 In another report, the photochemical method has been developed for preparing network-like FG (10 wt% F atoms), where graphite rods filled with powdery graphite fluoride (content of F: 60 wt%) are used as the cathode and the anode.134 In Gong's report,135 UV light was employed to prepare FG in HF solution using a readily available GO dispersion. Two products were obtained after 48 h of illumination, namely, the gray ones (FG) floating on the upper solution and the dark ones (the reduced GO, RGO) deposited at the bottom of the vessel; the average weight ratio of FG to RGO is about 1:10. This process fluorinates and reduces GO simultaneously without any additional photocatalysts, suggesting a novel alternative method to prepare FG via a simple photochemical route.

Upon oxidation, two distinct solid phases are observed, one of which forms a homogeneous, light-brown suspension in water, while the other rests on top.

3.1.2. Chlorine substitution. 
Theoretical calculations on the basis of DFT showed that chlorine (Cl) atoms interact with graphene in a very different way from the F case.136,137 A Cl–graphene charge-transfer complex was first formed in the initial reaction stage, and further chlorination produced more stable ClG. It was possible to tune the graphene bandgap by chlorination in a range of 0–1.3 eV. Chlorine decorated graphene (ClG) is prepared by conversion of the graphite oxide to thermally RGO under a high temperature shock in a gaseous halogen such as the Cl atmosphere138 (Fig. 4a) or in the presence of unstable Cl compounds.139 Another typical method is plasma processing.140,141 The Dai group141 investigated the reactions of Cl with several types of graphene materials and found that Cl plasma is controllable for graphene Cl-doping. Further investigation of Cl plasma effects on graphene revealed that the exposure process includes two stages. First, chlorination occurs fairly nondestructively and reversibly. Second, larger-area defects begin to form irreversibly at longer exposure time. In addition, the Liu group142 developed a nondestructive, homogeneous, and patternable photochemical chlorination method to graft Cl to the basal plane of graphene. A single-layer ClG sample could be synthesized after a series of photochlorination reactions.

Modified and reproduced from ref. 138, 143, and 144 with permission from The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
It is notable that a facile and effective hydrothermal method has also been developed to prepare multicolor Cl-graphene quantum dots (Cl-GQDs) with hydrochloric acid and fructose as the precursors (Fig. 4b).143 Their average diameter is about 5.4 nm (Fig. 4c) with 2 at% Cl content. Even more creatively, the Müllen group144 reported a general and simple edge chlorination protocol by the chemical synthesis method and achieved atomically precise chlorination of a series of nanographenes with C numbers ranging from 42 to 222 (Fig. 4d), corresponding to a molecular size of 1.2–3.4 nm. Consequently it demonstrated that the precise edge chlorination serves as an efficient approach to modulate the properties of nanographenes including solubility, band gap, energetic position of the frontier molecular orbital, and charge transport.


3.1.3. Bromine and iodine decorated graphene. 
Apart from F and Cl atoms, both Br and I have also been introduced into the C backbone of graphene. Fan and coworkers145 reported their systematic first-principles investigations of the absorption/insertion effect of single-/multi-layer graphene with Br atoms. It is found that the Br2/Br interaction is an effective way to adjust the Fermi level and engineers the electronic properties of graphenes.
Some investigations involving the preparation of Br and I decorated C materials have been reported.146 Currently, halogenated (Br and I) graphene can be prepared by the thermal treatment of GO in different gaseous halogen atmospheres like F and Cl decoration.26,138,147–149 Usually, p-type doping is exhibited in Br subgroup decorated graphene due to electron transfer from graphene to halogen species.26 Interestingly, without graphene as the raw material, Kalita et al.149 introduced a recyclable and environmentally friendly solid hydrocarbon–C10H16O as the carbon source due to the similar boiling point with I. In these experiments, C10H16O is evaporated at 200 °C and pyrolyzed at 800 °C with Ar as carrier gas. I was added to C10H16O with a ratio of 1:2 and pyrolyzed at 800 °C to form IG.

4. Dual- and multi-doped graphene (dG and mG)
The growth of graphenes co-doped with two or more heteroatoms (dual- and multi-doped graphene, respectively) has been explored to date by scientists with the development of doping technology. Co-doping using heteroatoms with different electronegativity could create a distinctive electronic feature and may bring in special synergistic effects.
4.1. Nitrogenous dG
Previously, several reviews on graphene have mentioned NG.70,150–152 N doping has been an effective way to tailor the properties of graphene. It was noted that additional doping of two or more heteroatoms into NG certainly induces a modification of the physical and chemical properties of NG, resulting in a significant improvement of doped graphene in related areas. In this series, we will mainly discuss the synthesis of nitrogenous dG and mG.

4.1.1. B- and N-substitution. 
Owing to their very similar lattice parameters, B, C and N can be atomically mixed together to form various hexagonal layered structures such as BCN graphene. Combining C with B and N atoms could offer different (B–C–N) layered configurations. BCN graphenes, called as B and N C-doped G (BNG) in some articles, have been prepared by thermally decomposing B-, C- and N-containing precursors chiefly by using a CVD process.153–156 The main method of B, N co-doping is the thermal treatment method. In general, BNG has been prepared by using two precursors as the boron and nitrogen source through thermal annealing. Both boric acid157–163 and B2O3164 can be the boron source, while ammonia,157,158 hydrazine,159 and some other N-compounds161,162,164,165 can be the nitrogen source. Obviously, the N- and B-doping level depends strongly on the annealing temperature and time in such methods. In particular, the Zhu group164 obtained the NBG hierarchical framework through a combined microwave-activated chemical-thermal treatment, the sample has a higher pore size than that of the sample prepared using the conventional heating method, this might be ascribed to the thermally unstable oxygen-containing groups on graphene sheets generated under microwave treatment. Some of BNG was obtained by using only one precursor containing both B and N atoms. For example, Kalita et al.165 obtained BNG by the reaction of CO2 with NH3BH3 in two sequential processes including carbon fixation and pyrolysis. Furthermore, in the work of the Shen group,166 the formation of the BNG was accomplished using the borane-tert-butylamine complex as the only one precursor impregnated with a certain amount of cobalt ions. Both carbonization and graphitization were simultaneously carried out in a tube furnace at a high temperature.
Solvothermal treatment also presents an important role in the synthesis of co-doped graphene with two or more heteroatoms, besides doped graphene. Recently, using GO as a source, BNG, that was involved by a hydrothermal process, is obtained by both the Müllen group167 and the Park group,168 sequentially. Especially, in the as-fabricated BNG by the Müllen group, combined freeze–drying process, an interconnected framework of ultrathin graphene nanosheets with porous structure, can be discerned. The pore size ranges from a few hundred nanometers to several micrometers. In contrast, BNG also can be directly synthesized from the reaction of CCl4, BBr3, and N2 in the presence of a potassium catalyst by the Baek group,169 BBr3 as a B feedstock and N2 as a N feedstock have a synergistic effect for B and N co-doping into the graphene network when they are applied together with CCl4, the resultant BNG has B and N contents of 2.38 and 2.66 atom%, respectively.


4.1.2. N- and S-substitution. 
A synergetic effect is also anticipated if S and N are co-doped in the graphene materials, similar to BNG. Xu et al.171 reported the synthesis of few-layered N, S co-doped graphene (NSG) by a conventional CVD method for the first time. The CVD process for the fabrication of NSG used pyrimidine and thiophene as pyrolytic precursors. The authors argue that the use of pyrimidine rather than pyridine leads to N-rich, dual-doped, few-layered NSG.
Generally, an easy way to obtain NSG is to use one-pot thermal treatment. The Wang group172 have employed the directly annealing treatment procedure to synthesize NSG through thiourea, in which the single thiourea chemical was used as both the N and the S source. Furthermore, mesoporous NSG was reported by the Qiao group173 for the first time to be prepared through a one-step doping process. Melamine and benzyl disulfide were selected as N and S precursors respectively. The doping process was carried out by heating the mixture of melamine, benzyl disulfide, GO, and SiO2. The porous structure in this work was formed in the NSG afterward by removing SiO2 nanoparticles with acid. Another caveat worth mentioning is that the Woo group174 have made significant contributions to the sophisticated doped graphene. A systematic study of (S and/or Se) in the NG and CNT self-assembly system was carried out in their work, dicyandiamide was used as an N-doping source, diphenyldisulfide and diphenyldiselenide were used for synthesizing NSG-CNT, NSeG-CNT, and NSSeG-CNT respectively.
Further efforts were devoted to the different morphology of NSG. Su et al.175 demonstrate a one-pot and low temperature synthesis of 3D NSG frameworks employing GO and NH4SCN as the precursors. Upon hydrothermal treatment, NH4SCN undergoes the decomposition into highly reactive N/S-rich species, which can react with the defective sites and oxygen-containing groups of GO. Simultaneously, GO can be reduced to graphene and assemble into 3D graphene forms. The Sun group176 reported a facile hydrothermal route for the first time to synthesize NSG quantum dots (NSGQDs) by using citric acid as the C source and urea or thiourea as N and S sources. By adopt this approach, the as-prepared NSGQDs are well dispersed in a narrow size distributions with mean diameters of 2.69 ± 0.42 nm and 3.10 ± 0.54 nm. What was less expected was the effect of bacteria,177 a novel approach to synthesize NSG is developed through sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) treating GO. The mixture of SRB and aqueous GO is incubated under an anaerobic condition in constant temperature. After that, the color of GO dispersion changes from brown to black implying the formation of NSG. These results are significant because they open up a new way to develop doped graphene by a simple, economical and environmentally friendly approach.


4.1.3. N- and other atom dG. 
N and other atom dual-doped graphene also have attracted attention other than relatively common BNG and NSG in some areas. In general, researchers will choose two precursors for the synthesis of the dual-doped graphene.159 In the work by the Tang group,179 N, F dual-doped graphene (NFG) was synthesized by annealing the mixture of NG and XeF2 with a mass ratio of 1:10, the XPS spectra reveal that the N content is 2.73 at% for NFG, while the F content is 45.56 at%. It has been predicted that the Si-doped graphene (SiG) could be an excellent candidate for the gas detection due to the low adsorption by using the theoretical DFT method.180 As a result, Niu et al.181 first report on the successful preparation of N, Si co-doped graphene (NSiG) nanosheets via annealing of N and Si-containing graphene oxide–ionic liquid composites. The law of N and Si content with the thermal treatment temperature is also studied, N content decreased gradually while the Si content increased gradually with the temperature increment. Similarly, some researchers used N and P sources to obtain the N, P co-doped graphene (NPG) by thermal treatment.159 A new and more convenient method is developed by Dong et al.,182 the single chemical (hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene) was used as both the N and P source in the process. The effects of thermal treatment temperature on the content of N and P (including the bond types) were studied in detail. We assume, similar to other dG, it is a simple and efficient method to prepare NPG with a single chemical.

4.2. Fluorinated dG and mG
Halogen atoms are important doping atoms for tailoring the reactivity of graphene and for widening the band gap of graphene for future applications in optoelectronics and photonics. We can obtain the halogen containing dG in the use of halogen compounds as precursors. Interhalogen compounds can simultaneously intercalate and fluorinate graphite, thus yielding intercalates with the formula C2F·xR (R = ClF3, BrF3, etc.).183,184 For example, FClG is accompanied by the intercalation of ClF3 molecules into the graphene network.184,185 Graphite was added to cold liquid ClF3 and kept for intercalation and fluorine functionalization. Later, excess ClF3 was removed, and then the graphite compound FClG with a composition of C2F·0.13ClF3 was obtained. The obtained FClG is golden in color and the composition in mass% is C 44.22; F 44.79; Cl 12.49.185 The Lee group employed a convenient solution based method for the synthesis of very high amounts of fluorinated (maximum of 38 wt%) reduced graphene oxide (B, F, and S doped graphene, BFSG) from GO using anhydrous BF3-etherate as the F precursor along with small amounts of boron and sulphur. The authors believe that BF3 acts here as a fluoride source and alkylthiol/alkyl amine serves as an activator, promoting the generation of a high amount of fluoride ions by the co-ordination with BF3.
5. Applications
Many literature studies have exhibited that substituted and decorated graphenes possess great potential applications in many fields such as electronics, catalysis, photonics, sensors, energy conversion and storage devices. Compared with carbon-based materials such as carbon nanotubes,187–190 graphene is more exciting due to its larger theoretical specific surface area, higher heat and electrical conductivity, which should be beneficial for multiple applications. Herein, we combine the unique properties of graphene nanosheets. We foresee that compared with doped CNTs, more potential applications may arise if the enhanced electrical and optical properties of doped graphenes were fully exploited. Following the systematical summary on the synthesis of heteroatom substituted and decorated graphenes (Tables 1–6), their promising applications are discussed in the sections below.

5.1. Field effect transistors (FETs)

5.1.1. p-Type doping. 
Doping provides an effective pathway to open the bandgap of graphene for electronic devices such as FETs. The B and halogen atoms are the natural candidates for doping in graphene because of their atomic size, electron-accepting and hole-donating behaviors similar to C, respectively. As a result, B and halogen doped graphenes exhibit the potential applications in the p-type electronic devices. Typically, drain–source current (Ids) increases with decreasing gate voltage (Vg) in the FET devices based on p-type graphenes.188,191,192
The replacement of C atoms with B atoms decreases the electron density of substituted sites, which is accompanied by a rise in the electron density of neighbour carbon sites.143 This is likely to have an impact on the chemical and electrochemical activity of BG. Some groups have observed p-type behavior based on BG.53 The Liu group47 have studied the FET performance of a BG monolayer device which exhibits a p-type doping behavior. A high carrier mobility of 800 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained in this work. Moreover, the Lee group45 carefully studied the relationship of the B amount and the band gap of BG. It was found that the bandgap of BG changed from 0 to about 0.54 eV with the increasing B content, leading to a series of modulated transport properties. Meanwhile, the on/off ratio can be controlled by the content of B in graphene as shown in Fig. 5a and b.

The inset has Ids/Vds characteristics at various Vg for BG. (d) I–V curves of a multi-layer FG sample at selected temperatures as indicated in the figure. Reproduced from ref. 45 and 141 with permission. 
Experimental and theoretical studies on graphene doping show the possibility of making p-type and n-type semiconducting graphene by substituting C atoms with B and N atoms,193–197 respectively. The dopant atoms can modify the electronic band structure of graphene, and open up an energy gap between the valence and conduction bands.154,198 In the work of the Baek group,169 it was indicated that the output curves of BNG show ambipolar characteristics, low hole and electron mobilities. It was expected that by co-doping B and N into the basal plane of graphene, the band-gap would increase, but the Dirac point would stay near 0 V because of charge neutralization between B and N (Table 7).

In fact, halogen chemistry has already been an effective tool to modify the chemical and structural properties of graphene,185,199–203 which led to a range of applications in electronics.120,125 For example, Robinson et al.102 realized that single-side fluorination could be sufficient to considerably modify the transport properties of graphene based devices by introducing scattering centers to reduce the charge in the conducting π orbitals and open the band gaps. The as-synthesized fluorination saturated graphene shows over 6 orders of magnitude more resistive than graphene, and the dirac point (DP) has shifted positively. Research on basic electrical properties of FG has also been carried out by Cheng and coworkers.120 It was found that the electrical properties of the as prepared FG could be reversibly modified by adjusting the reaction temperature. The crystalline FG exhibits strongly insulating behavior with resistance exceeding 10 GΩ, consistent with a large band gap. Multi-layer graphene regenerated through the reduction of graphene fluoride exhibits the resistivity of less than 100 kΩ at room temperature (Table 8).

In Dai group's report,141 the maximum conductance of Cl plasma-treated graphene devices was found to increase by 1.3–2.2 times of the initial conductance in the ambient air (Fig. 5d). The devices were found to be significantly p-doped, as none of the devices showed DPs within the measured Vg range after Cl plasma treatment of 30–180 s, indicating the DP of the ClG devices had shifted to a high positive Vg outside the accessible range. As previously mentioned, both the dc bias in plasma140 and treatment time142 have great impact on the doping level of Cl atoms and hence the carrier mobility of ClG (Table 9).

The reason for the differences in electrical properties could be due to the differences in the electronegativity of the halogens and their chemical states. In the halogen doping graphene, the relatively low electronegativity of Br, compared with F and Cl, results in the low concentration of free electrons. This effect is much less profound in the case of I due to its very low electronegativity. Therefore, I atoms in graphene exhibit very low resistivity for the presence of tri- and pentaiodide bonded to the graphene sheets.138 Park et al. observed that Br subgroups give the additional charges to the electron–hole puddle region.204 The charge neutrality point of IG and BrG shifts to the hole carrier regime, thus inducing the p-type doping. The change in maximum resistance (Rmax) in monolayer graphene is suggested to be a competition between mobility and doping induced carrier density. In general, Br and I are the effective dopants for the graphene monolayer, which can change the carrier concentration without significant degrading of the mobility, and accordingly provide the additional charges to the electron–hole puddle region.26


5.1.2. n-Type substitution. 
n-Type semiconducting behavior can be obtained by replacing C atoms with other atoms in graphene frameworks. It is preferable to the donating ability of their lone pair electrons to the system network.105 As recognized, N has been known as an effective atom for producing n-type semiconducting graphene channels by donating its lone pair of electrons to the graphene network.80,84,89,94,96 It has been revealed that the band gap of NG with a high N/C ratio reached ∼5 eV by a theoretical study based on the summary of previous work.92,205 The band gap can be, in fact, tuned by the presence of N atoms. Similarly, the P atom also has a pair of electrons, while the donor ability of P is much higher than that of N. Lee and coworkers105 claimed that the P doping effect on the graphene can produce much stronger n-type behavior than that of N doping. Further research shows that the DP of the as-prepared PG devices increased gradually from −77 V to −170 V as the rapid thermal annealing (RTA) temperature increased from 100 to 250 °C. Accordingly, the DPs of PG FETs were shifted from a weaker n-type character to a stronger n-type character (Table 10).

5.2. Lithium-ion batteries
Substituted graphene also has attracted attention as a potential anode material in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) because of its fascinating properties, such as high charge/discharge rate86,206,207 and capacities.64
It is worthwhile to note that the Cheng group64 successfully synthesized high-power and high-energy LIB materials of BG and NG simultaneously. BG exhibit reversible capacities of 1549 mA h g−1 in the first cycle and 1227 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles, which are higher than those of the NG electrodes (1043 mA h g−1 in the first cycle and 872 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles) as shown in Fig. 6a and b.
 Fig. 6  (a) Galvanostatic charge–discharge profile; (b) cycle performance and Coulombic efficiency of the BG electrode at a low current rate versus Li+/Li; (c) galvanostatic charge–discharge profile of PG vs. Li+/Li; and (d) rate performance of PG and G vs. Li+/Li. Reproduced from ref. 64 and 104 with permission from The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
So far there are a few studies related to PG in LIBs as an anode material. The report by the Hou group104 established a foundation for the application of PG in this field of LIBs. In the galvanostatic charge–discharge profile, it was seen that the 2nd and 80th cycles followed the same path as shown in Fig. 6c, which corroborate the excellent capacity retention of PG. The reversible discharge and charge capacity of PG is about 460 mA h g−1 over 80 cycles without loss, which is much higher than that of graphene (about 280 mA h g−1). Moreover, PG exhibited a moderate capacity loss at various current rates (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1). Nearly 100% discharge and charge capacity can be recovered once the rate is restored to the initial 0.1 A g−1 as shown in Fig. 6d, demonstrating a tremendous reversibility. The significantly improved electrochemical performance of PG is likely to be benefited from P doping. P atoms induced a large number of topological defects onto the graphene surface, which lead to the formation of a disordered carbon structure that further enhances the lithium insertion properties.
S could also improve the electronic conductivity as well as the lithium electroactivity.208,209 The Wan group210 prepared S-doped porous carbon hybridized with graphene (SPC@G) by a facile ionothermal method. The combined structural features endow the SPC@G with an ultrahigh reversible capacity, a long cycle life, and excellent rate performance, which could be contributed to the S-doping and the synergism of the two kinds of carbon in the nanocomposite. First, the RGO plays an important role in enhancing the electronic conductivity of the S-doped porous carbon for fast Li storage. Second, S-doping increases the electrochemical activity of the porous carbon material by increasing the number of nanopores and the interlayer distance. However, lithium–oxygen batteries have received attention as a promising energy storage system beyond LIBs for electric vehicles due to their extremely high specific energy densities. The Sun group111 reported that SG composite as lithium–oxygen battery materials produced markedly different discharge and charge properties from the separate component. The initial charge capacity of the as-prepared electrode is about 4100 mA h g−1, which is much higher than that of the undoped graphene. SG can act as a semiconductor compared to the pristine one, resulting in an increased electrode polarization in the battery. This will diminish the binding of the generated O2− to the substrate during discharge, thus enhancing the diffusion of the superoxide molecules away from the electrode surface, favoring the disproportional peroxide formation, and leading to a nanorod-shaped structure growth.
5.3. Supercapacitors
NG in general has been used as an excellent supercapacitor material in the previous studies.28,29,91,211–213 This stemmed from the basal-plane N atoms as claimed to have a dominant role in the capacitance enhancement. Here we focus on other types of atom substituted and decorated graphenes as promising anodes for high-power supercapacitors.
B-doping of carbon materials is an effective strategy to increase the electrochemical properties for supercapacitors.214–217 Niu and coworkers57 demonstrated that the BG with a B content of 4.7% exhibited a high capacitance of 172.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and maintained 96.5% of initial capacity after a continuous cycling of 5000 times in alkaline medium. Remarkably, B-doping increased the capacitance of BG by about 80% compared to pristine graphene. The enhanced electrochemical properties of BG can be attributed to the incorporation of B atoms and the high percentage of O atoms after B-doping. In addition, Park and coworkers62 reported that the products of BG from a solution process showed excellent supercapacitor performance, including a high specific capacitance of 200 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 as well as a good stability for 4500 cycles (Fig. 7a and b). However, the result of the BG supercapacitor derived by the Wang group63 was unusual. The BG obtained by exfoliation at different temperatures show a decreasing trend of weight-specific capacitance with an increasing amount of doped B atoms (Fig. 7c and d). This result goes against previous claims that BG demonstrated higher capacitance than nondoped counterparts. They supposed that the formation of sp3-hybridized C with covalently bonded BH2 group to the graphene backbone is the principal mechanism, rather than that C atoms are replaced by B atoms in graphene with hole or electron doping.62 And more important, the Müllen group,167 for the first time, obtained all-solid-state supercapacitors (ASSSs) based on 3D BNG. N and/or B doping in carbon networks can facilitate charge transfer between neighboring carbon atoms and thus enhance the electrochemical performance of carbon-based materials. As a consequence, the resulting BNG based ASSSs show high specific capacitance (≈62 F g−1), good rate capability, and enhanced energy density (≈8.65 W h kg−1) or power density (≈1600 W kg−1) with respect to undoped graphene, NG, BG, or layer-structured graphene paper. Fujisawa et al.163 studied the stability of pure-carbon-rich edges and/or heteroatom-decorated edges. B atoms that are predominately located at the edge-sites were oxidized and formed a BCO moiety, while N atoms were incorporated into the graphene lattice (quaternary nitrogen). For NB codoping, N atoms were present as the BNO moiety at the edges and as a BN moiety in the basal-plane. So, the BNG, compared with BG and NG, showed the largest capacitance in both acidic and alkaline media due to the presence of the BNO moieties along the edge sites.

Reproduced from ref. 62, 63, and 106 with permission. 
Unlike P doped carbons,218–221 very few reports actually looked into PG for the supercapacitors. Rajalakshmi fabricated the supercapacitor with a PG electrode.106 The high specific capacitance value of 367 F g−1, high energy density of 59 W h kg−1, and excellent charge–discharge profiles of more than 5000 cycles were observed. These properties are much better than the P-free counterparts of graphenes (Fig. 7e). They claimed that the high-performance exhibited by PG may be attributed to the increased pseudocapacitance due to the increased conducting network by P-doping and the reduction of GO.
5.4. Electrocatalysis
Fuel cell is an electrochemical energy conversion device that oxidizes fuel at the anode and reduces oxygen from air at the cathode to produce electricity.222 Efforts were devoted to the catalytic application of graphene due to its great chemical activity induced by the presence of abundant heteroatoms-containing functional groups. NG has so far been used maturely in fuel cells as either the catalysts directly or as the C support to anchor metal catalysts with enhanced catalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),4,79,98,223–226 where the ORR activity of NG through diffusion limited current and kinetic current was described in the same breath.78,83 These are the indication of ORR at the cathode to determine cell performance, cost and durability.227
Besides NG based devices, BG is also applied for electrochemical energy conversion devices.228,229 Specifically, the Xia group55 reported a catalyst-free BG with the B content of 3.2%, which exhibited a one-step process for ORR with an onset potential of −0.05 V, long-term stability in alkaline electrolytes, and good tolerance to methanol and CO (Fig. 8a–c). As a result, doping B atoms into graphene structures can tailor the electronic structures of graphene and consequently improve the electrocatalytic performance of BG towards ORR. Moreover, Pumera et al.63 contend that the increasing amount of B in doped graphenes lead to the larger negative potentials needed for ORR. The increasing amount of doped B atoms together with a decreasing trend of weight-specific capacitance presupposes the controllable capacitances of BG.

The single heteroatom-doped graphene materials for ORR are enormous such as NG and BG. It becomes a reality that co-doped graphene with two different heteroatoms rather than improving the doping level of a single heteroatom is an efficient method to improve the ORR performance. More recently, researchers have successfully synthesized BNG and demonstrated a significantly improved electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR, with respect to graphene doped with either N or B, only due to a synergetic effect arising from the N and B co-doping.156,159,164 The Dai group157 have developed a facile approach to metal-free BCN graphene (BNG) of tunable B/N co-doping levels as efficient ORR electrocatalysts based on the first-principles calculations. The BNG samples were demonstrated to show ORR electrocatalytic activities even better than the commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts. In fact, the Dai group technically produced a covalent boron–carbon–nitride (BCN) but not a real B- and N-codoped graphene (BNG). The Qiao group230 claim that they prepared the real BNG for the first time. The new BNG catalyst shows excellent activity in the ORR and perfect (nearly 100%) selectivity for the four-electron ORR pathway in an alkaline medium. Its activity is also much higher than that observed for singly BG and NG. Theoretical studies have confirmed the experimental data, DFT calculations indicated that the chemical coupling of B and N is the origin of a synergistic effect that boosts the ORR activity of the BNG through an alternative mechanism to that observed for BG and NG. Since then, BNG for ORR has commanded increasing attention.165 In the work of the Shen group,166 the as-prepared BNG shows a remarkable activity and high stability for the ORR. An onset potential of 0.95 V which is close to that of Pt/C and a well-defined limiting current plateau for the ORR is observed in alkaline media. In the work of the Park group,168 the BNG exhibits an onset potential of 0.81 V in a basic medium, follows near the four electron pathway, and shows excellent stability against methanol poisoning and during durability tests.
There are less discussions on the potential of PG in ORR compared to NG. Since P has a lower electronegativity, or higher electron-donating ability than C,231 it is of great significance to explore the unique properties of PG. Recently, the Hou group75 exhibits that the as-synthesized PG has outstanding ORR activity, including a significantly increasing onset potential of ca. 0.92 V, an excellent selectivity against the electrooxidation of methanol, as well as a long-term stability of only 13% current loss (Fig. 8d–f). In Li's work,107 a high BET surface area of PG is favorable for ORR applications. In the test, the PG electrode shows a very high ORR onset potential of −0.0261 V, which is very close to that of the Pt/C electrode (−0.026 V). Recently, Choi et al. indicated that additional doping of B or P into N-doped graphite induces a modification of the physical and chemical properties of N-doped graphite, resulting in a significant improvement of the ORR.232,233 Based on this, they have prepared NPG as a catalyst for ORRs in acidic media.159 The graphene based NPG catalysts revealed high onset potentials, about 0.86 ± 0.01 V (vs. RHE). The NPG showed 0.80 mA mg−1 of mass activities. The value is about 1.8 times higher than that of the NG. Additional doping of P in NG derived electrophysical modifications of graphene, resulting in enhancement of asymmetry of spin density, facile electron transfer on the graphene basal plane, and decrement of energy gap. It was suggested that these modifications induced improvement of catalytic activity for graphene materials for ORR.
The use of IG as electrocatalysts for ORR is also explored.146 The metal-free IG catalyst can exhibit a high catalytic activity, long-term stability, and an excellent methanol tolerance for the ORR (Fig. 8g–i). The formation of more I3− structure than I5− on graphene plays a crucial role for high performance.
In general, graphenes doped with chalcogen118,234 allow better catalytic activity than the commercial Pt/C in alkaline media. SG could be a semiconductor with a small band gap or stays in a metallic form, which strongly depends on the content of doped S.109 Some studies showed a high catalytic activity for ORR on SG. S doping combined with the presence of O in a limited quantity results in the creation of positively charged sites in graphene, which serve as the key catalytic centers for ORR. Owing to the surface hydrophobicity and the unique porosity, the increased adsorption of OH– and O on these centers results in an enhancement in the efficiency of ORR.112 Analysis showed that both the limiting current density (6.99 mA cm−2) and durability of SG were improved apparently when compared with those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst and NG.113 S doping induces more strain and defect sites in the C material than N doping because of the larger atomic size of S than that of N. This may facilitate the charge localization and the coupled chemisorption of O. On the other hand, SG can also easily interact with molecules in the surrounding electrolyte via the lone pairs of S in the polarizable d-orbitals.235 Jeon et al. succeeded in trying to join together theoretical and practical research in the electrocatalytic activity of SG.117 The curious edge-SG exhibits an improved electrocatalytic activity than that of graphite and Pt/C. Theoretical calculations were conducted and showed that the electronic spin density, in addition to generally considered charge density, is a critical factor in the high ORR activity of SG. S atoms and sulfur oxides (OSO) doped at the edges of the graphene nanoplatelets could strongly promote the electrocatalytic activity. A synergetic effect is anticipated if S and N are co-doped in the graphitic networks on carbon materials,171,172,174,175 similar to B, N co-doped carbon materials.236 The Qiao group173 reported for the first time the design and one step synthesis of NSG. They achieved NSG catalysts with excellent ORR performance comparable to that of commercial Pt/C and significantly better than that of NG and SG catalysts. The DFT studies have revealed that the synergistic performance enhancement results from the redistribution of spin and charge densities brought about by the dual doping of S and N atoms, which is proposed as the active sites in ORR.
5.5. Applications in other fields

5.5.1. Solar cells. 
Heteroatom substituted and decorated graphenes for solar cells are underreported in the related literature studies.237–239 In fact, substituted and decorated graphenes could play a great role in the field of solar cells. B can increase the work function of graphene as an electron-deficient dopant. For example, the work function of graphene is about 4.5 eV. However, the Fermi levels of BG with a B content of 2 at% can be shifted by −0.65 eV.50 As a demonstration, the Zhu group46 evaluated the application of the BG in photovoltaics by using it for p-type electrodes in silicon-based p–n junction solar cells. The as-prepared BG can form a p–n junction with n-Si to deliver a power-conversion efficiency of up to 3.4% under AM 1.5. In such conditions, BG serves as not only a transparent electrode for light illumination but also as an active layer for electron–hole separation and hole transport. As auxiliary materials, the free-standing and high-quality BG nanosheets were first introduced into the CdTe solar cells.61 It has a favorable effect on improving the hole collection ability and reducing the barrier height to enhance the photovoltaic efficiency (7.86%) of CdTe solar cells compared with pristine graphene due to a larger density of the electron state generated near the Fermi level. The Zhu group116 investigated the effects of ClG for solar cells. The photovoltaic of ClG has presented a better conversion efficiency of 8.94% by a factor of 1.68 than the pristine graphene. The increased sign was attributed to Cl anions that possessed additional charge transfer sites and the impact of the holes at the surface of the graphene film.


5.5.2. Nonlinear optical properties. 
Now, recent investigations also devote to the nonlinear optical properties of substituted and decorated graphene. After doped by F atoms, graphene changes to be a two dimensional wide band gap semiconductor and optically transparent in the visible region. The Thomas group130 reported the optical power limiting properties of FG using the optical z-scan technique (Fig. 9a and b). FG has high nonlinear absorption and nonlinear scattering for its optical limiting threshold, which is about an order of magnitude better than that of GO. The fluorination can transform the carbon bonds of graphene from sp2 to sp3 hybridization. Therefore, the ability of tuning the ratio between the sp2 and sp3 fractions can powerfully adjust the optical properties of graphene. Couris and coworkers132 demonstrated the nonlinear optical response of FG attributed to the sp3 defects created by the F atoms and the oxygen rich functional groups in GO. These results were also confirmed in a similar work by Bourlinos et al.133 FG colloids with a high third-order nonlinear optical response were observed experimentally in Liaros' work.240 FG was found to exhibit sizeable nonlinear absorptive and refractive behavior compared to that of C60 fullerene. This enhancement has been attributed to the sp3 defects created by the highly electronegative F atom, which can give rise to large nonlinear absorption and therefore efficient optical limiting.

5.5.3. Field emission. 
Besides geometrical factors and spatial distribution, tailoring the work function by doping heteroatoms in graphene provided another means to improve the electron field emission.241,242 The excellent field emission properties of the turn-on electric field is 0.8, and 0.6 V μm−1 for BG and NG at 10 μA cm−2.52 As the applied voltage was increased further, the emission current density of ∼50 μA cm−2 was drawn at an applied field of 1.08, and 0.99 V μm−1 for BG and NG, respectively. These values are found to be significantly lower than the best values reported for graphene samples. Perhaps the low turn-on electric field and the emission currents are stable over a long period for BG and NG is due to the upshift of the Fermi level of graphene.


5.5.4. Magnetic properties. 
Room-temperature ferromagnetism in graphene based materials has also attracted considerable interest. Yazyev and Helm243 showed that magnetism in graphene can be induced by defects such as heteroatom doping. Fluorination was confirmed to be the most effective route to introduce localized spins in graphene. More recently, an investigation reported by Nair et al.244 revealed that the maximum magnetic moment achieved by the fluorination of perfect graphene is 10 times higher than that induced by vacancy. Feng et al.124 reported experimental evidence of the generation of localized spin magnetic moments on defective graphene. Both the high magnetic moment of 3.187 × 10−3 μB per carbon atom and the efficiency of 8.68 × 10−3 μB per F atom in FG were commonly aroused by many of small magnetic edge F clusters.


5.5.5. Biological applications. 
Carbon materials, including graphene and specifically GO have been studied for biological applications such as drug delivery and biosensing.245,246 The literature on FG as biological applications was rather sparse. However, the Ajayan group128 demonstrated that this unusual carbon material with clinically translatable multimodal capabilities has presented high application value to load hydrophobic therapeutic agents to the hydrophilic FG oxide basal plane that could be useful for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as ultrasound and photoacoustic contrast agents (Fig. 10). It also can serve as a photothermal ablation agent when irradiated with a NIR laser. In fact, the as-synthesized FG oxide has several functional groups in its lattice thus allowing for the same diverse chemical functionalization and loading capabilities.

5.5.6. Sensors. 
It also has been known for some time that doped graphene can be used for the detection of individual molecules adsorbed on its surface. Some experimental studies on doped graphenes show that the structural and electronic properties of the graphene-molecule adsorption adducts are strongly dependent on the graphene structure and some gas molecule adsorption configuration.247–249 Niu et al.,181 for the first time, successfully have prepared NSiG sheets. The as-prepared NSiG proved to be excellent candidates for metal-free sensors with a high response value in the NO2 sensing test. They inferred that the incorporated N atoms in the NSiG act as the adsorption sites for NO2, while the incorporated Si atoms increase the hole-doping level of the graphene network. The Zhu group164 demonstrate a fast and highly sensitive H2O2 amperometric sensor based on BNG. As an advanced electrode material, the obtained BNG showed improved electrochemical performance (a linear range from 0.5 mM to 5 mM with a detection limit of 0.05 mM) compared to that of single doped graphene (BG and NG) for the synergistic coupling effect. The sensor was further used to determine the concentration of H2O2in vitro released from CCRF-CEM leukemia cells and showed good applications in bioelectrochemistry.


5.5.7. Photoluminescence. 
As we know, doped graphene with heteroatoms can effectively change the bandgap, and make it great with different optical properties. Liu et al. have successfully synthesized NFG and it exhibits two strong ultraviolet (UV) PL at 365 and 310 nm, revealing the formation of two wide bandgaps of at least 3.4 and 4.00 eV, which are closely relative to the F and N co-doping. Furthermore, the PL at 310 nm of NFG can be appropriately tuned by tailoring the N content further.

6. Summary and outlooks
In summary, substituted and decorated graphenes have exhibited varieties of intriguing electronic and optical properties promising for applications in energy-, environment-, and biology-related fields. The availability of various methods for the preparation of substituted and decorated graphenes provides room to tune the intrinsic and surface nature of graphenes for specific applications. With an adjustable band gap, substituted and decorated graphenes possess functions for applications in photovoltaic cells, fuel cells, supercapacitors, batteries, catalysis, and so on.
On the other hand, some important issues to further the development of substituted and decorated graphenes is worthy of attention. For example, the new method and strategy for composition-, content- and position-precise modification of graphene with heteroatoms plus well controlled bond types is challenging. This achievement will allow the effective regulation of the surface chemistry and the electronic structure of graphene, which is crucial for important applications in various fields beyond those mentioned above. Further, more work needs to be done for the deep and comprehensive understanding on the relationship between different types of heteroatoms and properties. Theoretical study with the experimental support will play the essential role in pushing on the development of substituted and decorated graphenes.
As we have seen, substituted and decorated graphene has a related short developing history, but presents many wonders for the future. Considerable attention on the heteroatom-substituted and decorated graphenes have emerged in recent years and great potentials are still waiting for exploration. The new trend towards the multi-doped graphenes with different types of heteroatoms164–169 has opened up the new opportunity for multifunctional applications based on the synergetic functions. The rational assembly and composition of heteroatom-substituted and decorated graphenes with other functional components170–173 will further expand the applications of substituted and decorated graphenes.
