    , Accepted 18th January 2019First published on 20th January 2019AbstractTo achieve the direct storage of harvested energy, energy harvesting and storage techniques should be further developed separately, but the integration of these two areas should also be considered. In this work, by attaching a piece of Al foil and qualitative filter paper onto a paper-like supercapacitor (SC), a super compact self-powered supercapacitor (SPSC) was successfully fabricated. The hybrid device can be charged to more than 0.7 V when a wet swab is used, and this easy operation means that it can be charged when touched by a finger. The self-powered property is based on the effective integration of a metal–air cell and SC, allowing the dual-function electrodes to convert chemical energy into electric energy and store it in the SC directly. Our SPSC demonstrates superior output performance when compared to a single metal–air cell and can power a vibrating motor after the self-powered process. A higher output voltage can be achieved by assembling super compact self-powered supercapacitors (SCSCs) in series. This SPSC provides a new reference in the study of energy technology and self-powered wearable electronics.
Introduction
Flexibility, a high energy density and an easy to charge power source are indispensable properties in the rapidly developing field of wearable electronics.1 The main strategy used to achieve these aims focuses on the design and development of more powerful energy storage units, such as supercapacitors (SCs) and various cells.2–5 Furthermore, it is highly desirable to charge these energy storage units by utilizing the neglected energy that is present in the environment. Recent research efforts have focused on new clean and renewable energy, such as triboelectricity6,7 and electricity induced by water.8–12 Generally, energy generation and storage processes are studied separately and the compatibility between them needs to be given greater consideration. Some attempts have been made to combine these two parts together, but most of these systems were electrically connected by conducting wires rather than being compactly integrated.13–15
Recently, some exciting progress has been made in the integration of all-in-one energy devices. Self-powered cells have been achieved by storing mechanical energy into dielectric materials,16 Li-ion cells17,18 or supercapacitors19–21via piezoelectric processes. In addition, this newly discovered triboelectric generator can be integrated with SCs or cells to form a self-storage energy unit,6,13,22,23 in which the supercapacitor (SC) can be charged to more than 2.0 V. However, the net charge in the piezoelectric generator depends on the output amplitude difference in the compression and relaxation processes, which will decrease the charging efficiency severely. A rectifier can be wired into the circuit to rectify the AC output of the triboelectric generator, but it will also cause extra energy loss and complicate the entire device.
The AC output problem can be overcome if the device is charged using other approaches. Ultrahigh Seebeck coefficients can reach 10 mV K−1 and 8 mV K−1 for a liquid and solid electrolyte ion thermoelectric supercapacitor, respectively.24,25 Similarly, photocapacitors have also been developed by combining solar perovskites with supercapacitors with an output voltage greater than 1 V.26–28 In addition, a new kind of fuel cell biocapacitor has been reported by Pankratov et al.,29,30 in which the electrodes manifest simultaneous electrocatalytic and charge-storage features.
Herein, based on the previous research in this field,31–33 a novel self-powered supercapacitor (SPSC) was fabricated using a simple process, and inherited the high flexibility, light weight and compact size from the paper-like SC. This device combined a SC and metal–air cell in a super compact manner and no connecting wires were needed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a metal–air cell driven SPSC, which was realized by simply attaching a small piece of Al foil and qualitative filter paper onto the electrodes. This innovative SPSC possesses easy operability and can be easily charged using a wet finger or swab, and the charging process can be activated or stopped by pressing or separating the filter paper. In addition to the super simple structure, the SPSC exhibited a charging voltage greater than 0.7 V and the output surpassed a single metal–air cell. The outstanding performance of our SPSC was based on the dual-functional features of the electrodes, which worked both as a SC and metal–air cell simultaneously.
Experimental
Super-aligned multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) were grown using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.34,35
Fabrication of electrodes and electrolyte
The typical fabrication process for the electrodes followed a method that has been described in previous works.31,32 Briefly, the carbon nanotube/polyaniline composite (PANI/CNT) electrode was synthesized using an in situ polymerization method. Ammonium peroxidisulfate (APS, 0.05 M) was used to polymerize the aniline monomer (0.05 M) in 1 M HCl solution. A round carbon nanotube (CNT) bucky paper with diameter 110 mm was immersed in the mixed solution at 0 °C for 24 h. The mass of the paper increased from ∼150 mg to ∼210 mg after polymerization. The polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/H2SO4 gel electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 6.0 g PVA in 60 mL 1 M H2SO4 at 85 °C under magnetic stirring.
Fabrication of hybrid device
The typical size of the Γ-shaped PANI/CNT electrode was 10 × 45 mm2, about 100 μm thick, and with a 5 × 10 mm2 horn coated with silver paste for electrical measurement. For the SC part, the electrolyte was coated on one side of the electrodes and two electrodes were pressed face to face to form a supercapacitor and the contact area was 10 × 23 mm2. Then, a piece of Al foil was attached to the other end of one PANI/CNT electrode. The size of the Al foil was 10 × 10 mm2 and its thickness was 50 μm. The other PANI/CNT electrode was covered with a 14 × 13 mm2 qualitative filter paper using double-sided tape. The filter paper was larger than the Al foil to prevent direct contact between the Al foil and the counter PANI/CNT. The middle part between the SC and metal–air cell was covered with scotch tape to avoid a short circuit. The average thickness and weight of the SPSC were about 300 μm and 165 mg.
Characterization
The microstructures of the materials were probed using scanning electron microscopy (NOVA NANOSEM450). The galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were performed on the LANDIAN Battery Testing System. The output voltages and currents and cyclic voltammetry were measured using Keithley 2410 with a computer control. The capacitance, stored energy and power were calculated using the formulas provided in the ESI.†
Results and discussion
The fabrication process of the device is shown in Fig. 1a. Briefly, the Γ shape PANI/CNT electrodes were cut using a laser cutter. Half of the two electrodes were stuck to each other using a PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolyte and formed a highly flexible paper-like SC.31,32 A piece of filter paper (Al foil for the counter electrode) was attached to the other end of the electrode. The middle part of the electrode was covered with scotch tape to prevent direct contact between the two electrodes. Fig. 1b shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the PANI/CNT composites. The well interconnected network provides a fast electron transport path in the thin film and results in a high electric conductivity of 8000 S m−1. The PANI was uniformly coated onto the surface of CNT and joined them together, while there are also some PANI nanobars in the matrix (blue rectangle in Fig. 1b). The combination of PANI and CNT has been studied using transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) in our previous work.32 A comparison of CNT and the PANI/CNT composite is presented in Fig. S1† to further confirm the coating layer of PANI on CNT. Our previous work shows that the CNT network has a specific surface area of 134.5 m2 g−1. The two peaks around 3 nm and 50 nm were assigned to the internal diameter of a single CNT and the pores between the CNT bundles.36 Larger pores can be easily observed in the SEM images. In order to further characterize the porous structure of the PANI/CNT composites, the porosity was calculated (92.8%) based on the density of the composites (eqn S9†). This high porosity can enhance the surface areas of the PANI/CNT composites, promoting the full use of the high pseudocapacitance of PANI and providing an ideal channel for the transport of electrolyte ions.

Self-charging process of SPSC
The galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry performance and cycling performance are shown in Fig. S2.† The device showed a specific capacitance of 203.7 and 201.4 mF cm−2 for the discharging process at 0.5 and 1.0 mA cm−2 respectively. The systematic study of this paper-like SC has been already reported,31,32 and showed wide practical applications.3,37–40 The paper-based device is an ideal platform for the further development of an energy harvesting and storage hybrid device.41,42 The SC in our hybrid device can be charged when the filter paper is pressed to the Al foil using a wet swab soaked with 1 M NaCl. As shown in Fig. 2a, the SPSC can be quickly charged to −0.50 V within 14 s and took 290 s to further charge it to −0.69 V, which is very close to the working potential (0.8 V) of the SC. The energy stored in the SPSC was 25.6 mJ cm−2 and filled a large percentage of the energy density. In comparison, it could only be charged by about 100 mV in some piezoelectric-SCs,19,20 which is far from fulfilling the energy density of the energy storage units.

Next, the NaCl solution was substituted by 0.5 wt% (0.085 M) NaCl solution, which is the main content of human sweat,43 as shown by the black curve. The charging behavior is very similar to that observed when using 1 M NaCl except for a slower charging rate and a smaller maximum output voltage. Within 556 s, our SPSC was charged to −0.60 V when the filter paper was pressed to the Al foil by a finger covered with this sweat. This hybrid device can be charged almost anytime and anywhere when people wear it, just using their own body fluid (sweat). This endows our SPSC with a superiority over other hybrid devices, which require a stable and high temperature24,25 or compressive stress for a relatively long time.22,23
Self-powered mechanism of SPSC
Many experiments have been conducted to determine the mechanism of the SPSC. In all experiments, the Al side of the SPSC always showed a lower potential than its counterpart. This phenomenon is similar to that reported by Kesong Hu et al., in which a primary cell was formed when the Al–graphene oxide (GO) junction was touched by a human finger.43 Furthermore, by utilizing the lactate in humans' sweat, a wearable biofuel cell based energy harvesting and storage hybrid textile device was developed.44 At the same time, the aluminum and CNTs in our experiments are ordinary electrode materials that are used in metal–air batteries,45,46 therefore the self-powered process of our SPSC could be driven by the Al–air cell. To verify this assumption, a PANI/CNT electrode and Al foil of the same size were placed into the NaCl solution in a beaker, the immersed area of each electrode was 1 × 1 cm2. The output voltage was 1.0 ± 0.05 V and the current is shown in Fig. S3.† The current magnitude first displayed a peak and gradually reached a stable state at about −0.62 and −7.2 mA in sweat and 1 M NaCl respectively. The different current density explains why our SPSC can be charged faster and achieve a higher maximum output using the NaCl solution that has a higher concentration. However, if the Al foil is simply sandwiched between the two PANI/CNT electrodes, the net output should be cancelled out as there are two Al–air cells connected in subtractive series. The output voltage direction in Fig. 2a indicates that the Al–air cell was formed between the Al foil and the counter PANI/CNT, while there is little potential difference between the Al foil and the lower PANI/CNT. This was further confirmed in Fig. S4,† which shows that the PANI/CNT–Al junction was turned into an ohmic contact when they were stuck together by silver paste. The I–V curve of the junction in Fig. S4c† showed good ohmic behavior and the output voltage was no more than 1 mV when touched with a wet swab. By contrast, the highest output of −950 mV was observed when the Al foil and electrode were bridged by a drop of water, which is similar to that observed when Al foil and filter paper were pressed together by a wet swab.
Taken together, all of the results and discussions detailed above prove that the SPSC is driven by an Al–air cell. The integration of the Al–air cell and SC was successfully realized in a compact way, which preserved the main features of the paper-like SC. The Al–air cell and SC are indicated by the red and blue rectangles in Fig. 2b and an equivalent circuit is proposed in Fig. 2c. The nature of the redox reaction between the oxygen in PANI/CNT and Al foil provided the output power and the chemical energy was converted into electrical energy and directly stored in the SC part. The electrodes in our SPSC play a dual function as both a SC and metal–air cell.
In order to gain a deeper understanding of the charging process, an Al–air cell was adopted to charge the SC device separately. The schematic of the setup is shown in the inset of the Fig. 3. An individual metal–air cell was fabricated by inserting a filter paper between the Al foil and PANI/CNT and a wet swab with 1 M NaCl was used, as before. The circuit voltage and the current are closely dependent. At first, the switch was turned to S1, the amplitude of the current quickly reached a peak value at −7.3 mA when the two electrodes were presses together. Then, it decreased gradually and became much more stable at about −0.23 mA. The voltage of the SC rose quickly to the peak value of 599 mV in 410 s. The peak value of the voltage is a little smaller than that observed for a SPSC in Fig. 2a, which may be due to the less effective charging process between the SC and Al–air cell when using external circuits. Unlike the galvanostatic charging process, the SC was charged by a decreasing current with a peak value. The voltage rose quickly at the beginning and the growth rate became slower and slower as the voltage finally approached its maximum. The discharging process was activated when the switch was turned to S2. Owing to the excellent conducting and large high pseudocapacitance properties of the PANI/CNT electrodes,32 the SC possessed a large output current density. The instant current was 39.2 mA, which is more than five times greater than the peak charging current, and it decreased at a faster rate than its counterpart in the charging process.

Demonstration of output performance
Aluminum is a cost-effective electrode element with a high energy density when used in a metal–air cell, but its power density is less than satisfactory.45,46 Here, we show that the output performance of the Al–air cell can be greatly improved using our SPSC. The single Al–air cell was fabricated as shown in the schematic in Fig. 3. A single Al–air cell and the SPSC were separately used to power a small vibrating motor with an internal resistance of 10.02 Ω. The line chart of the output voltage and power of a bare cell is shown in Fig. 4a. The open-circuited voltage of the cell is about −1.0 V and jumped to −11 mV when the switch was turned on (indicated by the arrow) and reached a relatively stable output of −45 mV. The maximum power of the cell was 0.061 mW, which was far from activating the vibrating motor. In comparison, the motor can be activated by our SPSC after the self-powered process using 1 M NaCl, and it can also drive an unmanned aerial vehicle motor for several seconds (videos are available in the ESI†). The output behavior can be effectively improved by our SPSC, as can been seen in Fig. 4b. The maximum discharging voltage was −395 mV when the switch was turned on after the SPSC was charged to −707 mV. The jump in the V–t curve is much smaller and it reached a relatively stable value of about −55 mV before the filter paper and Al foil were separated. The maximum power of our SPSC is 5.44 mW when powering the motor, which is almost two orders greater than that observed for a single Al–air cell. In addition to the large output power of a single SPSC, these hybrid devices can be easily scaled up to reach a higher output voltage. As shown in Fig. S5,† three super compact self-powered supercapacitors (SPSCs) assembled in series can reach an output voltage of 1.7 V, which is enough to light up a LED (working voltage threshold is 1.6 V, as indicated by the dashed line in Fig. S5†).

Cycling stability of SPSC
Cycling stability is an important property of the device. As the Al–air cell in this SPSC cannot be charged, the life span of the hybrid device is mainly dependent on the consumption of Al foil. Based on the parameters of the SPSC in our work, it can be self-charged 441 times, in theory (eqn S10–S12, ESI†). Employing more Al foil is an easy and direct way to extend the life span. Owing to the surface passivation of the Al foil, the voltage decreased from 0.732 to 0.632 V after being self-charged eight times (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the device can be charged to 0.653 V after renewing the Al foil. This demonstrates the reusability of our SPSC.
 Fig. 5  Cycling stability of the SPSC. In the 13th test, the Al foil was replaced by a new one. 
In our hybrid device, one electrode of SC also works as the cathode of the Al–air cell, and the Al foil works both as the anode and conducting wire. This design leads to the super simple and compact structure, which reduces the energy loss in the conversion and storage process and thus improves the overall efficiency. It should be noted that the structural design and materials have not been optimized in our study, and there is a plenty of room for further improvements to this novel SPSC. On the one hand, optimization of the proportions between the SC and Al–air cell could lead to a more effective self-powered process. On the other hand, more PANI in the carbon nanotubes could directly increase the capacitance of our device,32 the specific capacitance could be promptly enhanced by using super-aligned carbon nanotubes32 and the output voltage of the Al–air cell could rise to more than 1.5 V when using the specific electrolyte combined with a catalyst.46 In any case, the results described above have proven its potential as a lightweight, flexible and self-powered energy source and the integration strategy could be easily applied to other hybrid devices.
Conclusions
In this research, a lightweight, compact and flexible all-in-one energy generation and storage device was fabricated using a simple process, which can be directly charged using a finger. The SPSC involved the effective integration of a SC and Al–air cell and the device can be charged to more than 0.7 V. The key to the self-powered property is the dual functional feature of the electrode, in which an Al–air cell and an ohmic contact are formed on the two sides of the Al foil separately. The SPSC is charged by a decreasing current when a wet swab presses the two electrodes together. Compared to a simple Al–air cell, the SPSC possesses a much larger output, which can power a vibrating motor. By connecting three SPSCs in series, an LED can be easily lit up. All of these properties combined together show the great application potential of the SPSC in the field of wearable electronics.
