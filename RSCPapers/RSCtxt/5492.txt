    , Accepted 6th April 2016First published on 7th April 2016AbstractHematite (α-Fe2O3) has been intensely investigated for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, but diffusion of metal atoms from underlying layers often obscures the nature of improvements induced by intentional dopants and overlayers. Here we provide insight into the effects of Ti doping and FeOOH overlayers using hematite films with well-controlled, uniform doping profiles fabricated by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) followed by annealing at 600 °C. An optimum Ti concentration of 4.2% in the film doubled overall charge separation efficiency to 20% compared to undoped hematite by enhancing band bending. With Ti, carriers generated within 3 nm of the depletion region were separated with near-unity efficiency. Moreover, Ti improved interfacial hole transfer efficiency from <3% to 80% by increasing the concentration of surface-trapped holes that act as water oxidation intermediates. This effect is amplified by FeOOH, which increased hole transfer efficiency to ∼100%. The combination of Ti doping and FeOOH overlayer resulted in photocurrents of 0.85 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE and >1.0 mA cm−2 at 1.50 VRHE, which are competitive with champion planar hematite films. The approach for fabrication and analysis reported here can be applied to a wide range of materials to improve fundamental understanding and performance of PEC systems.
Introduction
Increasing global energy demand, diminishing fossil fuel reserves, and a growing awareness of anthropogenic climate change have generated much interest in renewable and environmentally benign alternatives for sustainable energy production. Hydrogen generation by photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising option to directly convert solar energy into energy stored in chemical bonds, provided that durable and abundant materials are employed in efficient devices. Hematite (α-Fe2O3) has been the subject of considerable research as a candidate photoanode material for PEC water splitting due to its widespread abundance, chemical stability in aqueous media, and a bandgap (∼2.1 eV) that is within the optimal range for water splitting.1,2
Despite significant research efforts, many challenges with hematite-based PEC water splitting have prevented solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies above 10% or photocurrents above 12 mA cm−2 that are possible for a material with a band gap of 2.1 eV.3,4 Challenges include a conduction band position that is too low in energy to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction without bias or an additional absorber, poor carrier collection due mainly to low intrinsic electron and hole mobility and high electron–hole recombination rate, and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics that result in a high applied bias necessary to compete with recombination.
Different doping strategies have been pursued to overcome the extremely poor carrier collection in hematite, with a particular focus on incorporation of titanium impurities.5 Although there is widespread agreement that doping with Ti improves the water splitting performance of hematite, the cause of the improvement has been attributed to different mechanisms. For example, Tang et al. attributed improved PEC performance to increased crystallinity and electron concentration in films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering.6 Glasscock et al. explained the improved performance by a catalytic effect on the water oxidation kinetics in reactive DC magnetron sputtered films.7 Zandi et al. observed performance enhancement in films grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) only at extremely small film thickness (≤20 nm). They attributed this improvement to reduction of charge trapping at the FTO/hematite interface and increased activity of the hematite surface, diminishing the so-called “dead layer” effects observable in ultrathin films.8,9 Kim et al. also observed improved performance primarily in ultrathin films grown by ALD, and suggested that suppressed surface recombination and increased carrier collection was due primarily to more severe band bending in the space charge (depletion) layer.10 Given the different fabrication methods employed in these and other studies, the differing conclusions do not necessarily indicate contradictory findings. Indeed, a recent exhaustive review of Ti incorporation into hematite indicated that the role of Ti depended strongly on the deposition method.5 In solution-deposited hematite, high levels of doping are often necessary to achieve appreciable photocurrent.11 However, Ti doping in solution-deposited hematite has yet to be studied systematically and in planar geometry, which is ideal for identifying the precise roles of dopants.
While intense efforts to improve the photoactivity of hematite with dopants and nanostructuring has produced promising results, the large applied bias required to drive the OER remains a critical barrier to efficient water splitting.3 Applying various overlayers to the surface of hematite films has yielded some success, resulting in 100 to 300 mV reductions in the onset potential.12,13 Recently, much interest has been generated by iron and nickel oxyhydroxide electrocatalysts due to their low overpotential and high quality interface with metal oxide semiconductors.14–16 Iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH), in particular, has been applied to hematite photoanodes, resulting in improved performance regardless of the fabrication method.17–19 However, the specific cause of the improvements remains in question. In principle, there are several ways these overlayers can improve the performance of hematite films.20 For example, Ye et al. reported the synthesis of FeOOH nanospikes, and attributed a higher plateau photocurrent to a significant catalytic effect of the FeOOH.18 Carbonare et al. reported deposition of FeOOH on hematite nanorods, and suggested improved hole trapping in surface reactive states is responsible for a decreased onset potential.17 However, Choi and co-workers deposited FeOOH on nanostructured BiVO4, and attributed the improved photocurrent primarily to passivation of surface states at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface.15,21 It is necessary to understand the fundamental physical effect of the FeOOH overlayer to fully utilize its promise. In each of the studies, nanostructured electrodes were used to maximize photocurrent, but application of overlayers (nanostructured or planar) can alter the active surface area and depletion region to a significant degree. These complex geometries, therefore, are not ideal for discovering the underlying role of FeOOH, and the need for a systematic study with constant geometry is clear.
Analysis of PEC water splitting with hematite is made more complex by the lack of agreement on the role of surface states. Klahr, Hamann, and others have argued that these surface states serve as specific chemical intermediates in the water oxidation reaction,16,22–24 while Barroso, Le Formal, and others suggest that they act primarily as recombination centres that compete with the water oxidation reaction.13,25–27 It is also possible that some surface states are integral to the water splitting process, while others are harmful.28 Clarifying the roles of these surface states is essential to understanding the effects of surface modifications and continuing improvement of the water splitting performance of hematite photoanodes.
Herein, we report on the effects and mechanisms of Ti-doping and FeOOH overlayers by investigating pure and Ti-doped planar hematite thin films with and without an FeOOH overlayer. Films were synthesized by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR). The constant geometry and composition of these planar thin films make them an excellent model system to investigate the roles of Ti dopants and FeOOH overlayers.29 Utilizing hole scavengers, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and structural characterization techniques, we show that Ti doping significantly improves hole delivery to the hematite/electrolyte interface, resulting in substantially increased water oxidation kinetics. In addition, we show that FeOOH overlayers play no notable catalytic role, but instead increase the density of active surface species capable of participating in the water oxidation reaction. As a result of these modifications, optimized 45 nm thin film electrodes were synthesized and exhibited high photocurrent densities of 0.85 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE.
Results and discussion
Hematite films were fabricated by SILAR deposition of amorphous FeOOH followed by annealing at 450 °C for 1 h and 600 °C for 30 min, as detailed in the Experimental section. Ti doping of the films was achieved by controlling the Ti/(Ti + Fe) ratio in the cation bath. The annealing treatment used here is significantly more mild than conditions used in our previous work29 and those commonly found in the literature, which frequently exceed 775 °C.28,30
To evaluate the effect of Ti doping, measurements of current density versus applied voltage (JV) were performed with ∼45 nm thick (90 SILAR cycles) hematite films at various Ti solution% in contact with 1 M NaOH electrolyte under 1 sun illumination. Significant improvement in the photocurrent density for the Ti-doped films was observed, in good agreement with several literature reports.6–8,10Fig. 1a shows the current density sampled at 1.23 and 1.4 VRHE as a function of Ti s%. The photocurrent response increases from nearly zero without Ti to a maximum of ∼0.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE with 5 s% Ti, then decreases significantly at 6 s%, which is similar to the trend observed in our previous report.29 In addition to improved photocurrent density, the onset potential (Von) shifted slightly from ∼1.0 VRHE (1.5 s%) to ∼0.92 VRHE (6 s%), indicating a possible surface effect of the Ti-doping (Fig. S1a†). However, an anodic shift of ∼0.2 V was observed in the dark onset as well.

(b) Fe2O3, and 5 s% Ti:Fe2O3 with and without an FeOOH overlayer. All hematite film thicknesses are 90 SILAR cycles (∼45 nm); FeOOH layer is 4 SILAR cycles (∼2 nm). 
Additional 5 s% Ti photoanodes with thickness ranging from 30 to 180 SILAR cycles (∼15–90 nm) were prepared to determine the effects of film thickness, as shown in Fig. S1b and c.† Under these sample conditions, photocurrent increases through a thickness of ∼45 nm (90 SILAR cycles), but then decreases rapidly for thicker films. Because Ti incorporation is nominally equivalent for each film thickness, we can neglect possible surface effects. Instead, the optimal film thickness of ∼45 nm is likely due to a balance between increased absorption and carrier recombination. The region near the substrate interface may have higher density of defects and grain boundaries, such that a thicker film enables the entire hole collection length to be outside this more defective region, while films that are too thick are limited by electron collection. We note that ∼45 nm films remain thin enough to be readily applied to high surface area scaffolds necessary for efficient light collection and charge separation.3,29,31,32
In order to further increase photocurrent, an ultrathin (∼2 nm, 4 SILAR cycles) FeOOH overlayer was applied to 5 s% Ti films, resulting in a slight decrease in Von and an improvement in the plateau photocurrent to 0.85 mA cm−2 and ∼1.0 mA cm−2 at 1.23 and 1.50 VRHE respectively (Fig. 1b). No further improvement with larger FeOOH thickness was observed, but thinner layers resulted in a non-continuous film. The high plateau photocurrent of these photoanodes represents a 3× improvement over our previous report of SILAR-deposited hematite,29 and it is comparable with record performance for planar hematite regardless of thickness or fabrication method.28,30
To determine the stability of the photoanodes, the photocurrent was monitored at 1.23 VRHE for 5.5 h. The photocurrent of the 5 s% Ti photoanode with and without the FeOOH overlayer decreased by ∼16% and ∼17% respectively in the first 2.5 hours, and subsequently remained stable for the duration of the measurement, as shown in Fig. S2.† The difference (∼1%) is within experimental error, indicating FeOOH is not a source of additional performance loss over several hours. The excellent stability of the FeOOH overlayer here is in agreement with previous reports of FeOOH deposited by electrodeposition methods.15,18,21
Improved photocurrent response from Ti-doping has been generally attributed to a combination of improved bulk material properties (resulting in increased carrier collection) and surface properties (resulting in increased water oxidation efficiency). Beneficial bulk properties can arise from increased electrical conductivity due to increased donor concentrations,33 improved crystallinity,6 or from the mitigation of charge trapping at the hematite/FTO interface caused by defects and grain boundaries that arise from lattice mismatch.8 Improved water oxidation efficiency has generally been attributed to the passivation of surface traps, but catalysis of the water splitting reaction is also possible. The FeOOH layer may increase photocurrent by catalysing the OER, as has been reported for FeOOH on hematite and on buried junction photovoltaic cells.18,19,34 However, reports of FeOOH deposited on BiVO4 photoelectrodes have revealed a surface passivation effect as well.15,21 In order to elucidate the role of Ti-doping and an FeOOH overlayer, systematic investigations were carried out with constant film thickness and morphology, as discussed below.
XPS depth profiles were conducted to determine the chemical composition and dopant distribution within the film. Fig. 2 shows atomic concentration as a function of sputter time (depth) for 5 s% Ti. The film shows a ∼4.2% Ti atomic concentration which is approximately constant throughout the bulk. Fe is present in the film at 35–40%. Thus, actual Ti/(Ti + Fe)% in the film (∼10%) is roughly double the s% in the SILAR cation bath (5 s%). We note that incorporating 4.2 at% Ti corresponds to a Ti density of ∼8 × 1020 atoms per cm3. We later calculate a dopant density of ∼2 × 1020 cm−3, in rough agreement with what would be expected if Ti acts as an electrical dopant. At the surface, ∼7% Ti is observed, which is nearly a factor of two greater than the concentration of Ti in the bulk. This enhancement is in accordance with our previous report of Ti-doped hematite via solid-state diffusion.29 Ti 2p, as well as Sn 3d, detail spectra are shown in Fig. S3.† The Ti 2p peaks are centred at 458.5 eV throughout the depth of the film, which corresponds to the Ti4+ state. Each peak can be fitted with one component with small FWHM, indicating a single oxidation state for Ti. Sn is also present in the film due to diffusion from FTO during the annealing process. However, its effects on water oxidation performance would be similar across samples, as diffusion doping is expected to occur to equal extent in Ti-doped and pure hematite films.

In order to check that Ti doping was not simply altering electrode thickness (increasing the growth rate of hematite or affecting surface morphology), the band gap, or absorption coefficient to a significant degree, all of which could increase the current density, SEM images and UV-Vis absorption spectra were collected for both pure and doped hematite films. SEM images (Fig. S4†) reveal conformal coating and a ∼5 Å per cycle growth rate regardless of the level of Ti doping, resulting in ∼45 nm thick films for all sample types. Because dead layer effects only persist up to ∼20 nm,8,35 photocurrent improvement upon Ti-doping must be due to some other mechanism. Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra of undoped and 5 s% Ti hematite films with and without the FeOOH overlayer. The absorption onset at just under 600 nm is consistent with the hematite band gap of ∼2.1 eV. No significant difference in absorption was observed between pure and Ti-doped Fe2O3, and the lack of change in absorption with FeOOH is consistent with the expectation for an ultrathin film.

GIXRD, in Fig. 4, confirms the presence of hematite, with characteristic diffraction peaks at 33.2° and 35.6° corresponding to (104) and (110) hematite reflections, respectively. Peak positions are identical for various s% Ti, indicating that Ti-doping does not influence crystallinity. The α-Fe2O3 peaks do not change position or relative intensity with grazing incidence angle, which indicates the hematite phase is present throughout the film thickness. The relative intensity of the two peaks matches the JCPDS powder spectrum, confirming there is no preferential alignment or texture of the film regardless of s% Ti. Therefore, Ti does not alter hematite orientation, which has been shown to influence photocurrent.36 The (104) diffraction peaks were fitted with pseudo-Voigt line shape, and FWHM was used to determine the crystallite size according to the Scherrer equation. The crystallite size, corrected for instrumental broadening, is ∼42 nm regardless of s% Ti. These values are close to the film thickness of ∼45 nm, indicating a high degree of crystallinity in the films. Because both crystallite size and peak position are roughly identical in both pure and doped hematite, we conclude that Ti is not enhancing PEC performance via improved crystallinity or strain-dependent conductivity.

To quantify the effect of titanium incorporation and the inclusion of an FeOOH overlayer, wavelength-resolved quantum efficiencies and JV curves were collected in a hole-scavenging electrolyte containing both 0.5 M H2O2 and 1 M NaOH. H2O2 quickly scavenges photogenerated holes delivered to the hematite surface, eliminating the barrier to interfacial hole transfer present with the OER.37 As described by Dotan et al., the water splitting photocurrent, Jph, can be expressed asJph = Jabs × ηsep × ηinjwhere Jabs is the photon absorption rate expressed as current density, ηsep is the charge separation efficiency within the bulk film, and ηinj is the efficiency of hole injection from semiconductor to electrolyte. In the presence of H2O2, ηinj can be treated as unity, as every hole that reaches the surface should be collected. Thus, absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (APCE) evaluated in the presence of H2O2 measure only the efficiency of hole delivery to the surface.10 In addition, under white light illumination, ηsep and ηinj can be calculated according to  and  
APCE plots in hole scavenging electrolyte for pure Fe2O3 and for Ti-doped Fe2O3 with and without an FeOOH overlayer at 1.23 VRHE are shown in Fig. 5a. IPCE data from which this figure is derived are shown in Fig. S5.† Collection efficiency is highest at short wavelengths (48% at 380 nm for 5 s% Ti) since photons are absorbed and generate electron–hole pairs closer to the front surface. APCE decreases as the wavelength increases and holes are generated deeper into the film. With 5 s% Ti, the hole delivery to the surface is increased by 2–3× compared to pure Fe2O3. At wavelengths >540 nm, 5 s% Ti induces significant enhancement relative to pure hematite. Kim et al. previously attributed similar behaviour to reduced recombination of holes generated by the Fe(3d) → Fe(3d) photoexcitation, which occurs above 550 nm.10 As expected, the presence of an FeOOH overlayer does not have any significant effect on the efficiency of hole delivery to the surface.

Colour scheme for all panels follows that in (b). 
Separation efficiency under white light illumination is plotted as a function of applied voltage in Fig. 5b. For both pure and Ti-doped films, separation efficiency increases with applied voltage because the depletion width increases. However, separation efficiency is only ∼20% even in the best cases, indicating that charge separation is a significant limitation of photocurrent. At lower applied voltages, the inclusion of titanium hinders charge separation. Above ∼0.75 VRHE, separation is improved by the presence of 5 s% Ti, eventually reaching ∼20% at 1.23 VRHE, which is twice that of pure hematite films. Separation efficiency for varying s% Ti films are shown in Fig. S6.† The trend in Fig. S6† is similar to that in Fig. 1a, suggesting that balancing possible improvements with reduced mobility from impurity atoms in the hematite lattice is necessary for optimal photocurrent. No change in bias-dependent separation efficiency is observed with the inclusion of an FeOOH overlayer.
Injection efficiency under white light illumination is plotted as a function of applied voltage in Fig. 5c. Titanium incorporation substantially improved injection efficiency, which increased from nearly zero to above 75% at 1.23 VRHE. Adding an FeOOH overlayer improves hole injection to nearly 100% at 1.23 VRHE, in accord with the photocurrent improvement in standard electrolyte (Fig. 1b).
EIS was performed to further evaluate the role of Ti-doping and FeOOH overlayer in enhancing the charge separation and injection efficiency of hematite films. The equivalent circuit model, shown in Fig. 6a, was originally reported by Hamann and Bisquert for hematite deposited by atomic layer deposition, and has been used extensively in the literature.12,22,31,38,39 This model assumes that charge transfer across the semiconductor/electrolyte interface occurs through a trap state, and therefore includes the capacitance of the bulk hematite film (Cbulk), a resistance to electrons recombining with holes in the surface trap state (Rrec), a capacitance of the surface state (Css), and a charge transfer resistance from the surface states to the electrolyte (Rct,ss). Characteristic Nyquist plots measured under illumination at an applied potential of 1.0 VRHE are shown in Fig. 6b for Fe2O3 and for 5 s% Ti-doped Fe2O3 with and without an FeOOH overlayer. At this potential, each sample shows two clear semicircles, consistent with the 2-RC equivalent circuit model for water oxidation. However, the resistance of the low-frequency (right-most) semicircle associated with Rct,ss is significantly reduced in Ti-doped films, indicating a strong influence of Ti on interfacial kinetics. The charge transfer resistance is further reduced in the presence of FeOOH. The total resistance from EIS (Rtot = Rs + Rrec + Rct,ss) matches that calculated from the JV curves (Rtot = dV/dJ), as shown in Fig. 6c. Rtot from EIS and JV curves are in good agreement, indicating that the main resistances that control photocurrent are represented in the electrochemical impedance spectra.

(b) Nyquist plot measured at 1.0 VRHE under 1 sun illumination and (c) Rtot measured from JV curves (lines) and fitted parameters (points) from the equivalent circuit shown in (a) for Fe2O3 and for 5 s% Ti:Fe2O3 with and without an FeOOH overlayer. Colour scheme in (b) also applies to (c). 
Fitting the EIS data yields the equivalent circuit parameters compiled in Fig. 7 and 8 for pure and Ti-doped hematite with and without an FeOOH overlayer. Cbulk values increase dramatically for Ti-doped films, and decrease with increasingly anodic applied potential, as expected for the Mott–Schottky (MS) response of an n-type semiconductor. MS plots were prepared from Cbulk values measured under dark and illuminated conditions, shown in Fig. 7a. Derived flat band potentials of 0.4–0.5 VRHE were obtained, which falls within the fairly large range of reported Vfb for hematite.12,29,30 A ∼100 mV cathodic shift in Vfb was observed upon Ti-doping, consistent with our previous report.29 No shift in Vfb was observed with the addition of an FeOOH overlayer, in accord with the work of Carbonare et al.,17 but in contrast to Yang et al.19 The FeOOH overlayer utilized here may be too thin (∼2 nm) to appreciably alter Vfb. The dopant density, ND, was derived from the slope of the MS plots, resulting in values of 8.9 × 1018 cm−3 and 1.7 × 1020 cm−3 and corresponding to depletion widths of ∼17 nm and ∼4 nm for pure and Ti-doped hematite, respectively, at 1.23 VRHE.

Data were collected under 1 sun illumination. Hole density curves in (a) were calculated assuming a flat band potential (Vfb) of 0.4 VRHE. Colour scheme in Fig. 7a applies to all panels here. Error bars represent standard deviations with sample size n ≥ 4. 
From these data, we are able to gain insight into the dynamic effect of Ti on charge separation efficiency (Fig. 5b). Ti substantially increases the majority carrier (electron) density, so photogenerated holes are more likely to recombine with free electrons. At low applied voltages, this effect dominates, leading to reduced separation efficiency (Fig. 5b) and resistance to recombination (Fig. S7a†). As the applied voltage increases, Ti incorporation becomes beneficial to charge separation. The reduction in depletion width with Ti doping at a given voltage corresponds to significantly more severe band bending in the depletion region, and a ∼4–5× increase in the strength of the electric field. The associated higher drift velocity results in enhanced charge separation within the depletion region. However, the smaller depletion width also results in a significantly smaller number of photons being absorbed in the depletion region.
To quantify this effect, the absorption in the depletion region was calculated from the absorptivity derived from Fig. 3, and is shown in Fig. 7b for pure and Ti-doped hematite at 1.23 VRHE and in Fig. S8† for a series of applied voltages. Convoluting the absorption with the AM 1.5 spectrum indicates that 42% of the photons absorbed in the entire 45 nm film are absorbed within the 17 nm depletion width for pure Fe2O3, compared to only 11% for Ti:Fe2O3 which has the same absorptivity but a depletion width of only 4 nm at 1.23 VRHE. If only photons that were absorbed within the depletion region contributed to photocurrent, then the separation efficiency for the 5 s% Ti film would be ≤11% at 1.23 VRHE. However, the separation efficiency is ∼20%, which is roughly double the expected value. Therefore, we conclude that Ti enables near-unity collection of carriers generated within the depletion region, as well as collection of some carriers generated outside the depletion region. For the separation efficiency to reach ∼20% at 1.23 VRHE, all holes generated within ∼7 nm of the surface should be collected, which indicates that holes must have diffusion lengths (LD) of ∼3 nm, in agreement with previous literature reports.3,40

Fig. 7c shows the ratio of the experimental separation efficiency to the maximum separation efficiency possible if all carriers generated within WD + LD were collected. For pure Fe2O3 films, only ∼20% of the carriers generated within WD + LD are collected, regardless of applied voltage and resulting depletion width. In contrast, charge separation within WD + LD reaches unity above 1.0 VRHE for 5 s% Ti-doped films. This applied voltage corresponds to an average electric field strength of ∼0.17 V nm−1. The data for each film type is fit well with a Boltzmann distribution, in agreement with the probabilistic nature of charge separation.
For insight into the hole injection characteristics of the films, the resistances and capacitance associated with the surface were analyzed. Css of Ti-doped films, Fig. 8a, showed a considerable buildup of charge near the onset potential of the JV curve that corresponds to the Rct,ss minima at ∼1.0–1.1 VRHE (Fig. S7b†). An analysis of the dynamics of water oxidation revealed that the kinetic parameter for charge transfer is proportional to the ratio Rrec/Rct,ss.41 For each photoanode type, Von occurs when the Rrec/Rct,ss ratio is between 0.01 and 0.1, consistent with the observation by Zandi et al.30 Therefore, the 1–2 orders of magnitude increase in this ratio with Ti-doping indicates strongly increased water oxidation kinetics with Ti-doped hematite films, which is in good agreement with the improvement in hole injection efficiency (Fig. 5c). This may be due to a higher fraction of iron species capable of participating in water oxidation, as has been suggested previously,8 but a more succinct description comes from considering the improved delivery of holes to the surface (Fig. 5a–c) and the concomitant rise in Css. At Von (0.90 VRHE, or 0.50 V vs. Vfb), Css reaches a value of ∼35 μF cm−2 for 5 s% Ti films, corresponding to a surface hole density of ∼1.1 nm−2. A recent rate law analysis of water oxidation on hematite surfaces revealed a strong dependence on the density of photogenerated holes at the hematite surface.42 Le Formal et al. suggest that the reaction transitions from a slow, first-order reaction at low hole accumulation (<1 nm−2) to a third-order reaction for surface hole densities above 2 nm−2. In their case, increasing the surface hole density from <1 nm−2 to 2 nm−2 resulted in a 20-fold increase in rate. The density of iron atoms on the hematite surface is ∼8 atoms per nm2,42–44 and each iron surface atom has three to four closest neighbouring metal atoms.3 Thus, photocurrent onset, and the transition from first to third order dependence, occurs when oxidized iron atoms first begin to have a nearest neighbour metal atom that is also oxidized. We therefore attribute increased water oxidation kinetics and the corresponding significant photocurrent improvement with Ti-doping to improved delivery of holes to the hematite surface.
The addition of an FeOOH overlayer to 5 s% Ti hematite films results in a slight decrease in Von and ∼40% increase in the plateau photocurrent (Fig. 1b). The decrease in Von may be attributed to the lower potential required to reach the critical hole surface density of >1 nm−2. Otherwise, no significant change in Rct,ss and Rrec is observed, indicating that FeOOH plays no catalytic role in the oxidation of water. However, the magnitude of the Css peak increased by 4× compared to Ti:Fe2O3 without FeOOH, suggesting that improved segregation of holes into water oxidation intermediates is responsible for the improved photocurrent response with an FeOOH overlayer. We note that the Css peak of ∼190 μF cm−2 at 1.0 VRHE (0.60 V vs. Vfb) corresponds to a surface hole density of ∼7 nm−2, which indicates that nearly every surface iron atom is oxidized. This interpretation is in agreement with the injection efficiency shown in Fig. 5c, which is expected to reach 100% once all possible surface species are oxidized.
Previous studies have suggested that oxidation of Fe(III)–OH terminations to Fe(IV)O species is the first step in water oxidation.22,23 FeOOH, an amorphous hydrated oxide, easily undergoes the proton-coupled electron transfer leading to the reactive surface intermediate Fe(III)–OH. Therefore, the increased Css peak with FeOOH may be due to an increased fraction of active Fe(III)–OH at the hematite surface, which is consistent with the analysis by Carbonare et al.17
Conclusions
In this work, we explored the enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting properties of SILAR-deposited, Ti-doped hematite thin films with an FeOOH overlayer. Incorporation of Ti impurities into the hematite lattice nearly doubled the efficiency of hole delivery to the surface by enhancing charge separation within the depletion region as well as enabling collection of some holes generated outside the depletion region. Surface-trapped holes act as water oxidation intermediates; and improved delivery of holes to the surface also resulted in improved OER kinetics with Ti because it enables a critical surface hole density of more than 1 nm−2 to be attained, which results in a dramatic change in the reaction rate law. The FeOOH overlayer efficiently segregated an even higher fraction of holes into water oxidation intermediates, resulting in near-unity hole injection efficiency. However, no catalytic effect could be attributed to FeOOH because the critical hole density (∼1–2 nm−2) required for the transition to higher order OER kinetics had already been reached. This study provides insight into the nature of improvements induced by dopants and overlayers on hematite thin films, and demonstrates a simple approach to high performance solar water splitting with hematite. Because SILAR is a facile solution deposition process with tight control over layer thickness and the introduction of dopants, it offers unique, rapid insight into the roles of dopants and overlayers. The methods of deposition and analysis reported herein may be readily extended to other materials, dopants, and overlayers.
Experimental
Material fabrication
FTO/glass (TEC 15, Pilkington) substrates were cleaned by sequential sonication at 60 °C for 15 min in 20% Contrad 70 (Decon Laboratories), acetone–ethanol solution, and 1 M HCl, followed by multiple rinses in DI water and drying under a nitrogen stream. Hematite films were deposited by modifying our previously reported recipe.29 Thin films of iron(III) oxyhydroxide were deposited on the substrates by repeated SILAR (nanoStrata, Strato Sequence VI) cycles, followed by annealing to convert to hematite. One deposition cycle was defined as immersion in (1) cation solution, (2) DI water rinse, (3) anion solution, (4) DI water rinse, and drying for 7 s under an air stream. Each immersion step lasted for 10 s. The cation solution was 0.05 M FeCl3 (97%, Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol with 1.75 μL concentrated HCl per 1 mL solution. For titanium incorporation, titanium isopropoxide (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cation solution. By varying the amount of titanium isopropoxide added to solution, different concentrations of Ti-doped samples were fabricated. For example, adding 155.7 μL of titanium isopropoxide to 200 mL of solution resulted in a 5% Ti/(Ti + Fe) cation precursor. Because the actual atomic concentration of Ti in the films is not known for all samples, we use “solution%” or “s%” to refer to Ti concentration in the cation solution for SILAR. As we show by XPS, 5 s% Ti corresponds to ∼4.2 atomic%. The anion solution was 0.1 M NaOH in water. The anion and rinsing solutions were replaced every 30 cycles to prevent particle formation that could lead to nonplanar films, and the cation solution was replenished every 60 cycles to account for solvent evaporation. To obtain fully oxidized α-Fe2O3 with desirable PEC performance, the samples were annealed in air using a box furnace at 450 °C for 1 h and then at 600 °C for 30 min. The average heating and cooling rates were ∼35 and 10 °C min−1, respectively. For films with an FeOOH overlayer, iron oxyhydroxide was deposited via SILAR and heated at 200 °C for 1 h to improve stability.
Film characterization
The absorption spectrum for each sample was determined by measuring both transmission and diffuse reflection using a PerkinElmer (Shelton, CT) Lambda-950 UV/visible/NIR spectrometer equipped with a Labsphere, Inc. (North Suttin, NH) 60 mm diameter diffuse-reflectance integrating sphere.
Films were imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Supra 50 VP) at 5.0 kV. Film thickness measurements were obtained using cross-sectional micrographs of the film.
Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) was conducted on thin film samples at incidence angles ranging from 0.3° to 0.8° using a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα X-ray source excited at 40 kV and 44 mA. Diffractograms were acquired using parallel beam in-plane optics with a step size of 0.050° and analysed with Fityk software.45 Instrumental broadening for determination of crystallite size was obtained from the (100) peak of ZnO nanowires with crystallite size >100 nm.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Physical Electronics VersaProbe 5000 with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source operated at 15 kV and 25 W. The X-ray spot size was 100 μm. Depth profiling was performed by argon sputtering at 2 kV and 2 μA within a 2 mm × 2 mm area. Data analysis and peak fitting were completed using CasaXPS software with the relative sensitivity factors provided by the equipment manufacturer. Metallic elements were assigned Shirley-type background while nonmetals were assigned linear background. Peaks were fitted with 70% Gaussian–30% Lorentzian line shape. All spectra were corrected by adjusting the adventitious C–C 1s peak to 285.0 eV.
Photoelectrochemical characterization
All samples were masked with electroplater's tape that contained a 0.38 cm2 (7 mm diameter) hole to define the active area. The samples were examined in contact with a 1 M NaOH (pH 13.6) electrolyte. A saturated Ag/AgCl electrode (ThermoScientific, Orion 90-02) was used as a reference electrode, and a platinum coil was used as the counter electrode. All potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale byERHE = E0Ag/AgCl + 0.1976V + 0.0592pH
PEC measurements were performed with a Gamry potentiostat and electrochemical software. To collect linear sweep voltammograms, an increasingly anodic bias was applied at a rate of 50 mV s−1. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data were collected using a 10 mV amplitude perturbation between 10000 and 0.1 Hz, and was fit to equivalent circuits with the simplex algorithm, as described in the text, using Gamry software. The light source was a 300 W Xe arc lamp (Newport). An AM 1.5G filter (Newport) was used to simulate the solar irradiation spectrum, and the power was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun) using a thermopile detector. Light was incident through the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. A custom-made glass electrochemical cell (Starna Cells Inc.) with quartz windows housed the electrodes and electrolyte for all measurements.
