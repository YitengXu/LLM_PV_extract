    , Accepted 7th February 2022First published on 7th February 2022AbstractGlass and glass-ceramics containing nanocrystals of Bi2Te4O11 cubic phase co-doped with Er3+ and Yb3+ were prepared by heat treatment of the precursor tellurite glass and investigated for optical applications. Lanthanide doped tellurite glass and glass-ceramics have been extensively investigated because of their optical and photoluminescence performance for technological photonic applications. Er3+ and Er3+/Yb3+ doped TeO2–GeO2–K2O-Bi2O3 tellurite glass compositions were prepared by the conventional melt-quenching method. Photoluminescence results showed the important role played by Yb3+ ions when co-doping with Er3+ ions in comparison with the Er3+ single-doped glass. Due to their larger absorption cross-section, Yb3+ species significantly absorbs 980 nm photons and effectively transfers them to Er3+ ions via a set of mechanisms including ground-state absorption (GSA), excited-state absorption (ESA), and energy transfer upconversion (ETU). Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped sample was chosen for the synthesis of transparent glass-ceramics by controlled heat treatment above Tg for 5 to 120 min. X-ray diffraction patterns, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) from Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped glass-ceramic samples were used to verify the nanocrystal precipitation, crystalline phase, and chemical nature. The structural change resulting from the crystallization of Bi2Te4O11 nanocrystals was evaluated by the Raman shift of the bands between 300–500 cm−1, which are assigned to the formation of Bi–O–Te linkages and the reduction of [TeO3] depolymerized units. The effects of HT time on the glass-ceramic's optical and upconversion photoluminescence properties were studied in the visible range under excitation at 980 nm in terms of the energy transfer mechanisms from Yb3+ to Er3+. Results indicate that Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped tellurite glass and glass-ceramics are potential candidates for photonic applications in lighting, energy conversion, and luminescent solar cell concentrators.
1. Introduction
Glasses containing heavy oxides such as TeO2, Bi2O3, and PbO are promising materials for near-infrared (NIR) technologies, non-linear optics, and the design of solid-state lasers.1,2 Among the oxide glasses, those based on TeO2, namely tellurite glasses, have been extensively investigated due to their structural and optical properties, including low phonon energy (∼700 cm−1), extended infrared transmittance (from 0.3 μm to about 5 μm), high non-linear and linear refractive indices (∼1.9–2.2), and thermal stability against crystallization.3–5 Due to their mechanical strength and thermal stability, tellurite glasses can be obtained as optical fibers and planar waveguides.6,7 In addition, tellurite glasses present high rare-earth ion (RE3+) solubility, which makes them suitable candidates for the development of many kinds of active photonic devices.
The choice of a suitable glass host matrix for RE3+ dopants is a key factor. In the optical amplification process, the pumping efficiency and the emission bandwidth strongly depend on the structural properties of the glass host. The demonstration of a broadband Er3+-doped tellurite fiber amplifier in 19978 has led to extensive research using tellurite-based glasses for a range of optical applications.9 Jha et al. measured the maximum relative amplification gain, in 50–100 mm tellurite-based optical fibers in the C- (1535 nm) and L- (1560 nm) bands, of 30 dB and 15 dB, respectively.10
In addition to the promising performance of Er3+-doped tellurite for optical amplification in telecom, over the past few decades, much attention has been given in the field of materials capable of emitting light for many technological applications in solid-state lighting, laser medium, multicolor displays, biophotonics, integrated photonic and optoelectronic systems.4,11,12 Different methods have been explored to achieve efficient visible and infrared light emitting materials: dye-laser systems, inorganic and organic light-emitting diodes (LEDs, OLEDs),13,14 frequency conversion luminescence in RE3+ doped materials, and so on. Active photonic glasses and glass-ceramics containing luminescent RE3+ are widely explored in the last decades mainly via three distinguished processes: (i) frequency down-shifting emission, in which the material emits a lower frequency light under excitation with a higher frequency one, e.g., emission of visible light upon ultraviolet excitation;15,16 (ii) frequency upconversion processes (UC) mediated by energy transfer, in which the material emits one high-energy photon upon the absorption of two or more low-energy photons, e.g., visible light emission upon infrared excitation,17,18 and (iii) the frequency down-conversion emission, in which two or more low-energy photons are emitted upon the absorption of just one high-energy photon, with the quantum efficiency approaching to 200%, e.g., infrared light emission upon visible excitation.19,20 Er3+ and Er3+/Yb3+ doped glass, glass-ceramic, and ceramic materials are extensively applied in the field of optical amplification, lasers, and optical thermometry.21–24
Particular attention should be given to visible transparent glass-ceramic materials since they present hybrid crystalline and glassy properties due to the presence of uniformly dispersed crystallites embedded in a glass host, combining the good mechanical and thermal properties of ceramics with the versatility of glass production and their remarkable optical properties. Visible transparent glass-ceramics can be obtained by reducing the size of the crystallites formed in the glass matrix lower than the incident light wavelength or obtaining crystals with similar refractive indices as the glass host; otherwise, the crystals may scatter the incident light and reduce the material transmittance.25,26 For tellurites, only a few works have reported visible transparent glass-ceramics with improved optical properties since they often present surface-nucleated instead of volumetric crystallization.27–29 Recently, Kang and coauthors presented the improvement of Er3+-doped germanotellurite luminescence at 2.7 μm when glass-ceramic is formed.30 The formation of nanocrystals in RE3+-doped glass-ceramics provides a low-phonon energy environment, which is responsible for reducing the nonradiative decay rate and improving the energy transfer mechanism between two RE3+ ions.
In this sense, this work reports the results obtained for Er3+-doped and Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped tellurite glass and their transparent glass-ceramics in the quaternary TeO2–GeO2–K2O–Bi2O3 system aiming to contribute with the understanding of how crystallization in tellurite glass may affect the visible upconversion emissions. The precipitated Bi2Te4O11 nanocrystals present interesting physical properties such as photo resistivity and ionic conductivity.31,32
2. Experimental
Er3+-Doped and Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped tellurite glass samples were obtained with molar composition of 98.5[65TeO2–15GeO2–10K2O-10Bi2O3]:0.3Er2O3/1.2Yb2O3 and 99.7[65TeO2–15GeO2–10K2O–10Bi2O3]:0.3Er2O3, labeled as TGKB:Er and TGKB:Er/Yb, respectively, by conventional melt-quenching technique under ambient atmosphere. Batches of 10 g were prepared by weighing the raw materials TeO2 (PriChem, 99.99%), GeO2 (Alfa-Aesar, 99.9%), K2CO3 (Aldrich, 98%), Bi2O3 (Aldrich, 99%), Er2O3 (Prichem, 99.99%), and Yb2O3 (Prichem, 99.99%), thoroughly homogenized in an agate mortar and then placed in a gold crucible for melting. The sample was melted at 750 °C for 30 min for the complete elimination of CO2 and ensure homogenization, then cast into a stainless-steel mold pre-heated at 280 °C, annealed for 3 h at this temperature, and slowly cooled to room temperature. The glass samples were cut into equal pieces and optically polished with parallel faces for further characterizations and synthesis of glass-ceramics (GC). GC samples were obtained from the same pristine TGKB:Er/Yb glass by submitting each glass piece under a controlled heat treatment (HT) process at Tg + 50 °C (388 °C) for different times of 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, labeled as GC-X, where X means the HT time in min.
DSC experiment was performed on TGKB samples to obtain the characteristic temperatures of TGKB doped glass (Tg for glass transition and Tx for crystallization onset, with an error of ±2 °C for Tg and Tx) using a TA Instrument Model 2910 calorimeter on bulk samples in the temperature range from 200 to 600 °C under N2 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. XRD diffractograms were obtained using a Bruker instrument Model D8 Advance diffractometer from 10–90° and step of 0.02° s−1 with Cu Kα1 radiation. Optical absorption spectra were recorded on the TGKB:Er, TGKB:Er/Yb, and GC samples of about 1.7 mm thickness using a Cary 500 (Varian) double-beam spectrophotometer in the wavelength range from 350 to 2000 nm. Raman scattering spectra were recorded at room temperature using a LabRAM HR Evolution from Horiba Jobin Yvon equipped with a laser at 465 nm delivering 27 mW power. HRTEM images and selected area electron diffraction patterns were obtained from the GC-60 sample, which was prepared from an ethanolic suspension of the GC powder deposited on a Formvar® coated grid of 300 mesh. A JEOL microscope FEI model Tecnai G20F20 (LaB6 200 kV) with 0.19 nm point resolution and up to 200.000 times magnification was used. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed in a Fluorolog-3 Horiba Scientific (model FL3-22) equipped with double monochromators and a R928 Horiba photomultiplier under excitation from a Xe lamp and continuous wave (CW) CrystalLaser CL-2005 laser at 980 nm coupled with a standard multimode fiber. These measurements were performed at room temperature (∼28 °C) and corrected by the instrumental response. The luminescence decay measurements were recorded with the same equipment using a 150 W xenon pulsed lamp delivering pulses lasting 40 μs.
3. Results and discussion
TGKB:Er and TGKB:Er/Yb glasses were obtained as pinkish bulk samples in color, optically homogeneous to the unaided eye and strain-free avoided by the use of long melting time, swelling and low cooling rates. Fig. 1 shows the visible UC emission spectra for both samples under 980 nm excitation, varying the pumping power from 50 to 250 mW. TGKB:Er spectra display two emission bands in the green region centered at 525 nm and 550 nm, assigned to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively. In the UC, the emission intensity area Iem and the infrared excitation power Pexc are related as Iem ∝ (Pexc)n, where n is the number of infrared photons absorbed per visible photon emitted. The inset of Fig. 1(a) shows the log(Iem) vs. log(Pexc) plot for the intensity area of the higher energy green emission at ∼525 nm. Adjusting to a linear fit with R2 = 0.998, the angular coefficient value n of ∼2 indicates the number of absorbed photons involved in that emission. In this case, the emissions may occur via ground state absorption (GSA) followed by excited state absorption (ESA) of a sequential 980 nm photon by the same ion, promoting the electrons to the Er3+ 4F7/2 level, from which they non-radiatively decay to lower energy emissive levels 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 assigned to the 525 nm and 550 nm emission bands through radiative decay to the 4I15/2 Er3+ ground state.3,17

In addition to the similar green emission bands displayed in TGKB:Er, for the TGKB:Er/Yb spectra under 980 nm excitation, a band in the red region centered at 660 nm is also observed and assigned to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+. This feature can be attributed to the well-known sensibilization promoted by Yb3+ in the concentration ratio of 1:4 (Er:Yb) of Er3+ in low phonon energy hosts, promoting the increase of all visible emission band intensities. This fact enabled the observation of red emission by the TGKB:Er/Yb glass, although with low intensity with respect to their green emission bands. Under 980 nm excitation, Yb3+ effectively transfers energy to Er3+via excited state absorption (ESA) and energy transfer upconversion (ETU) mechanisms. Yb3+ has a larger absorption cross-section of about 11.7 × 1021 cm2 compared with the 1.7 × 1021 cm2 found in Er3+ at 980 nm, enabling the most efficient absorption of infrared photons, and consequently, increasing the energy transfer (ET) probability between neighbouring ions possessing equivalent excited state levels with similar energy, such as 2F5/2 (Yb3+) and 4I11/2 (Er3+).33,34 The inset of Fig. 1(b) shows the log(Iem) vs. log(Pexc) plot for the green and red emission bands. Linearly fitting the curve with R2 = 0.998, the angular coefficient value n of ∼2 and ∼1.64 indicates the number of absorbed photons involved in the visible emissions. It is worthy to note that TGKB:Er does not exhibit the red emission observed for the TGKB:Er/Yb glass. Besides, it may be related to an increase of the electronic population of the 4F9/2 level of Er3+ through energy transfer upconversion (ETU) mechanisms, which efficiently occurs when co-doped with Yb3+, and the low Er3+ concentration (0.3 mol%) in TGKB:Er results in an inefficient upconversion process, whereby the red emission is not registered.
As depicted in Fig. 2 for TGKB:Er/Yb under 980 nm excitation, Er3+ excited states 2H11/2, 4S3/2, and 4F9/2, responsible for the green (maximum centered at 525 nm and 550 nm) and red (maximum centered at 660 nm) emissions, are populated through different paths in addition to those contributions by direct absorption of Er3+. Due to the larger absorption cross-section of Yb3+ at 980 nm, 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 are more efficiently populated via ETU mechanisms: at the excited states of Er3+ (4I11/2 level) and Yb3+ (2F5/2 level), Yb3+ transfer energy to the Er3+, exciting their electrons at 4I11/2 to 4F7/2 Er3+ level, from which they non-radiatively relaxed to the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels, emitting at ∼525 nm and ∼550 nm, respectively, when radiatively decaying to the 4I15/2 Er3+ ground state. Comparing the absolute area ratio between the green emission bands A525/A550 of TGKB:Er and TGKB:Er/Yb samples under excitation power of 200 mW, the obtained values of 0.09 and 0.38, respectively, indicate the contribution of Yb3+ as a sensitizer of Er3+ to enhancing the green UC emissions through cooperative mechanisms of energy transfer and absorption paths. From the 4S3/2 excited state, the electrons also non-radiatively relax towards 4F9/2, giving rise to the red emission via4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition (∼660 nm). Another path to populate the 4F9/2 level occurs by ETU: non-radiative decay from 4I11/2 to 4I13/2 of excited Er3+ (GSA), followed by absorption of a second 980 nm infrared photon, which excites the electrons to the 4F9/2 level, contributing to the red emission through 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition.

In order to estimate the color dependence as a function of power laser excitation, Fig. 3 depicts the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram and the shift of (x,y) coordinates from yellow/green to yellowish/green with the increase of excitation power from 50 to 250 mW for both samples. In Fig. 3(b), the (x,y) CIE coordinate shifts reinforce the role of Yb3+ to efficiently sensitize the Er3+ under infrared excitation (increase of green emission with respect to the red one). The increase of excitation power is responsible for enhancing the green emission intensities due to the increase of the electronic population at Er3+ 4S3/2 and 2H11/2 levels, resulting in the coordinates shift toward green.

On the basis of the improved UC photoluminescent features of TGKB:Er/Yb compared with TGKB:Er sample, the co-doped glass has been chosen to serve as the precursor glass for the synthesis of transparent glass-ceramics (GC) by a controlled heat treatment procedure (temperature and time) and how the crystallization affects the upconversion luminescence of tellurite glass. Transparent glass-ceramics containing rare-earth ions (RE3+) have been extensively investigated because their luminescence features may be enhanced by the presence of crystalline phases where the RE3+ ions are contained or are close to the ordered sites.35,36 Under these structural conditions, RE3+ produces spectra similar to those obtained in crystals, and lower multi phonon decay rates may be expected for some excited states when inserted or close to the crystalline environment.37,38
In order to establish the appropriate temperature to obtain visible transparent GC, i.e., the most suitable temperature in which the crystallization process can be controlled, from the DSC curve, three heat treatment (HT) trials above glass transition temperature were performed. Glass transition temperature (Tg), the onset temperature of crystallization (Tx), and thermal stability parameter (ΔT = Tx − Tg) were determined from the DSC curve at 338 °C (±2 °C), 432 °C (±2 °C), and 94 °C (±4 °C), respectively. Equal pieces of glass were submitted to HT using a horizontal furnace at 373 °C (HT1 = Tg + 35 °C), 388 °C (HT2 = Tg + 50 °C), and at 398 °C (HT3 = Tg + 60 °C) for 30 min. Fig. 4 presents the diffractograms for the HT1, HT2, and HT3 samples. Regardless of the HT temperature employed, the diffraction peaks show the growth of a single cubic crystalline phase of structural formula (Bi2Te4O11)0.6667 of Fm3n space group according to the ICSD number 50839.39 Hence, according to the XRD and the need to control the crystallization in a short period of time, Tg + 50 °C (HT2) temperature was chosen for the synthesis of GC, which was labeled as GC-X with X values indicating the HT time of 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. To ensure that the same mechanism of crystallization is operative, the GCs were obtained from the same TGKB:Er/Yb glass piece.

XRD patterns for co-doped glass and GC-X are presented in Fig. 5 as a function of HT time at Tg + 50 °C. As expected, the glass XRD pattern exhibits a broad diffuse halo with a maximum at 2θ of 28° and 50°, while for GC-X samples, the growth of a single cubic phase of structural formula Bi2Te4O11 and spatial group Fm3m, cell parameters of a = b = c = 5.6385 Å, α = β = γ = 90°, and cell volume of 179.26 Å3, according to the ICSD 50839, as a function of annealing time is observed.39 CG-48 h was heat-treated at the same temperature for 48 h to obtain a GC sample with the highest crystallinity to identify the main diffraction peaks corresponding to the obtained cubic phase. Despite the GC-5 sample not exhibiting diffraction peaks in the diffractograms, it was named as glass-ceramic since it was subjected to HT above Tg.

From the XRD patterns, the diffraction peak width at 2θ = 27.5° was used to obtain the crystalline size of Bi2Te4O11 nanocrystals as a function of HT time. The crystallite sizes were obtained based on the Scherrer's equation:  where D is the nanocrystal's crystallite size in nm, K is the shape factor (dimensionless and equal to 0.9), λ is the X-ray wavelength in nm, β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak at 27.5°. The calculated crystallite size increases monotonically with increasing HT time, presenting values of 13.2, 15.7, 30.5, 35.4, and 49.3 nm for GC-15, GC-30, GC-60, GC-120, and GC-48 h samples, respectively.

Fig. 6 presents the HRTEM images of the GC-60 sample. The crystalline nature was confirmed and determined through a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern from the GC-60 sample, as shown in the upper left inset of the same figure. From SAED, the diffraction angles 2θ were calculated through measurements of the white spot distances aided by the PTC Lab® software and converted into dhkl (in nm). Compared with the ICSD 50839 indexed phase, the diffraction peaks extracted from SAED present the three highest intensities at 27.4°, 31.7°, and 56.5°, corresponding to the following set of planes, respectively: (111), (11−1), (1−11), (−1−1−1); (020), (200), (002); and (2−22), (22−2), (−2−2−2), (222), for the cubic Bi2Te4O11 crystals. The crystals were well dispersed in the GC-60 sample, and the distance between the lattice fringes (d-spacing) was measured to be 0.20 nm and corresponded to (2−20), (02−2), (20−2), (022), (202), (220) planes of the Bi2Te4O11 phase with 2θ of 45.5°,39 as shown in the upper right inset of Fig. 6. It is worth noting that SAED was not recorded from the same region.

TGKB:Er/Yb and GC-X sample's transparency were investigated through their absorption spectra from 350 to 2000 nm and shown in Fig. 7 for samples with 1.7 mm thickness. As can be seen from the sample pictures in the inset of Fig. 7, an increase of their opacity is observed and is related to the light scattering due to the growth of grain sizes with respect to the increase of HT time at 388 °C. The narrow absorption bands are assigned to the f–f electronic transitions of Er3+ and Yb3+ from their ground states 4I15/2 and 2F7/2, respectively, to the excited states. For Er3+, the absorption bands centered at 1550 nm, 660 nm, 545 nm, 525 nm, 488 nm, and 451 nm are assigned to the transitions to 4I13/2, 4F9/2, 4S3/2, 2H11/2, 4F7/2 and 4F5/2 levels, respectively. Due to the higher content of Yb3+ (molar ratio of 1:4), the band centered at 978 nm corresponds to the overlap of Er3+: 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 and Yb3+: 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transitions. In the visible region, the glass sample has the highest transparency, and the crystallization leads to the shifting of GC absorption edge to lower energies, which can be related to the increase of overall glass polarizability (non-bridging oxygens) and light scattering caused by the formation of Bi2Te4O11 crystals.40

The results shown by XRD and HRTEM suggest structural changes occurring due to the glass crystallization processes at different times. In order to evaluate the structural changes on the tellurite glass host after HT, Raman spectroscopy was performed for TGKB:Er/Yb and GC-X samples, as presented in Fig. 8(a), including the standard spectra of TeO2, Bi2O3, and Bi2Te4O11. TeO2 precursor is formed by linear chains of bipyramidal [TeO4] units (α-TeO2 or paratellurite) characterized by four bands at 119 cm−1, 147 cm−1, 393 cm−1, and 643 cm−1 attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching of Te–O bonds in a 3D network. Bi2O3 is constituted by highly distorted [BiO6] corner-shared octahedrons presenting four main bands at 280 cm−1, 310 cm−1, 410 cm−1, and 445 cm−1 corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of Bi–O–Bi and Bi–O of [BiO6] units.41 According to Udovic and coauthors,42 the Raman spectrum of Bi2Te4O11 is constituted of two strong bands centered at 645 cm−1 and 720 cm−1, assigned to the symmetric stretching vibration of O–Te–O bonds and pulsation vibration of terminal Te–O in the [TeO3]2 units, respectively, and two bands around 400 cm−1 are assigned to the Te–O–Bi linkages.42,43

Raman spectra of TGKB:Er/Yb and GC-X show interesting features that point out some remarkable structural changes as a function of the HT time. In general, multicomponent tellurite glass such as TGKB:Er/Yb commonly present Raman bands from 550 to 850 cm−1 related to the three distinct polyhedral: trigonal bipyramid units [TeO4] of highest connectivity; [TeO3+1] units resulting from [TeO4] conversion in the presence of glass modifier compounds, in which one Te–O bond is elongated, and less connected [TeO3] units.44,45 These bands were labeled as T1, T2, and T3 bands, respectively, and were also observed for GC-X samples. Regardless of the HT time, the sample spectra present a very weak band centered at 298 cm−1 assigned to the Bi–O–Bi bond of [BiO6] units, which apparently maintain the intensity and position regardless of the HT time.46 The spectral region between 300 and 500 cm−1, shown in Fig. 8(b), is composed of the contribution of Te–O–Bi stretching band at ∼395 cm−1 and Te–O–Te symmetrical stretching or bending vibration at ∼430 cm−1.42,47 As the HT time is increased, this overlapped broadband is shifted to lower wavenumbers, which is related to an increase of the Te–O–Bi band contribution. It suggests that the crystallization process induced by the HT at 388 °C changes the tellurite glass network by the formation of Bi2Te4O11 crystals embedded into the non-crystalline tellurite matrix. The Raman shift is pronounced above HT of 15 min and is related to the formation of Te–O–Bi bridging bonds in the complex tellurite anions [Te4O11]6− from charged [TeO3]2− pyramids, without polymerizing via the Te–O–Te linkage, which is observed by the decrease of their Raman band intensity.42 This behavior can also be understood from the curves of the integrated intensity area obtained by the deconvolution of the vibration bands T1, T2, and T3 as a function of the HT time, as shown in Fig. 8(d). Assuming the Raman spectra – although influenced by the formation of Bi2Te4O11 crystals – provide information mostly from the glass structure. Band T1 ([TeO4] units) maintains its intensity regardless of the HT time, indicating the formation of Bi2Te4O11 crystals does not cause strong glass network depolymerization. However, the bands T2 ([TeO3+1] units) and T3 ([TeO3] units) present opposite behavior above HT of 15 min, suggesting that an increase and decrease of T2 and T3 intensities, respectively, indicating the contribution of [TeO3] depolymerized units in the formation of Bi2Te4O11 crystals, which no longer act as glass network units and becoming part of the precipitated crystalline phase, evidenced by the formation of Bi–O–Te linkages assigned to the Raman region from 300 to 500 cm−1. Meanwhile, an increase in T2 intensity takes place, indicating that during the crystallization processes, the forming units of the non-crystalline network [TeO4] are constantly deformed during the crystal formation within the glass matrix. This behavior could also be related to the contribution of the Raman band at 720 cm−1 of Bi2Te4O11, mainly above the GC-15 sample.
In order to elucidate the influence of the controlled crystallization of Bi2Te4O11 crystals on the photoluminescence of Er3+/Yb3+ pair in the GC-X samples, particularly with respect to the mechanisms of energy transfer, visible emission spectra were acquired under 980 nm excitation at room temperature and corrected by the instrumental response, as shown in Fig. 9. Besides comprehending the photoluminescent features against the phase crystallization, the cubic phase of Bi2Te4O11 can present interesting physical properties, such as photo resistivity and ionic conductivity.32 Therefore, maintaining the same experimental setup and excitation power of 200 mW, the comparison among emission intensities became more reliable. Hence, an increase of the emission intensities is clearly observed as the HT time is increased, mainly above 15 min. This behavior suggests that RE3+ ions are experiencing a structurally ordered chemical environment surrounding them (more symmetrically). Consequently, with specific phonon energies relative to the fundamental vibrational modes of the Bi2Te4O11 crystals, the nonradiative decay probabilities of Er3+ are reduced. The CIE chromaticity diagram presented as the inset of Fig. 9 shows a slight change of the (x,y) coordinates of the GC-X samples as a function of HT time, retaining the emitted color at the yellowish/green region. Yu and coauthors also reported an increase of about two orders of magnitude in the emission intensity of the Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped phosphate GC compared to the corresponding pristine glass sample.48,49 Similar results were reported by Ming and coauthors.50

As a consequence of increasing the crystalline phase inside the glass network dictated by the growth of Bi2Te4O11 crystals, a decrease of nonradiative transitions in the GC-X samples is expected as HT time increases, leading to an enhancement of emission intensities by the formation of crystalline phases near the RE3+ or containing a fraction of them. The time-resolved luminescent decay of TGKB:Er/Yb and GC-X samples are shown in Fig. 10. The lifetime for the green emission centered at 550 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) was analyzed and presented in Table 1. For samples TGKB:Er/Yb, GC-5, and GC-15, two components (τ1 and τ2) were observed in the exponential fit, in which τ2 is remarkably slower than τ1, indicating two different recombination centers, one on the non-crystalline tellurite network and the other from the highly ordered regions homogeneously dispersed in the glass network as Bi2Te4O11 crystals.

As shown in Table 1, for samples HT up to 15 min, a prevalence of τ2 is observed, which might be related to the different decays via the dominant non-crystalline domain instead through the low concentration domain of Bi2Te4O11, slightly affecting the Er3+/Yb3+ photoluminescence properties. In these samples, τ1 component refers to the lifetime of RE3+ ions located closer to the lowered phonon energy domains (crystalline phase) than to the multiphonon environment of the tellurite host. On the other hand, i.e., for GC-30, GC-60, and GC-120 samples, due to the increase of crystallinity degree evidenced by the XRD data, grain size calculation, and the Raman shifting of 350–500 cm−1 bands associated with Bi2Te4O11 crystal formation, only τ1 component is observed. As the concentration of Bi2Te4O11 increases in the glass host, the τ1 prevails over τ2 for these samples due to the increase of crystallinity surrounding Er3+ and Yb3+, which are approaching with the material crystallization, also evidenced by the increase of grain size from 13.24 nm (GC-15) to 49.34 nm (GC-48 h). The τ1 component is favored, suggesting the insertion of the ions nearing environments of higher symmetry, as evidenced by the rising of average lifetime (τav) from 2.015 to 3.087 ms when the heat treatment time is increased from 0 to 120 min.
The presence of environments with higher phonons energies also explains the increase of emission intensities from 4S3/2 (∼545 nm) and 4F9/2 (∼660 nm) levels, as can be seen in Fig. 9. The relative intensity between these two emissions changes towards favoring less energetic emission, indicating energy loss through phonons, as shown in Fig. 11. Whereas the Er3+ in glass is predominantly surrounded by TeO2 units, in the glass-ceramic samples, the erbium ions are near the crystalline phase of Bi2Te4O11. Thus, considering the increase of phonons directly interacting with the coordination sphere of Er3+, we may have the lanthanide ions closer to each other (a consequence of glass crystallization), leading to cross-relaxation processes evidenced by the increase of red emission intensity. This energy redshift and the slower decay can be explained by reabsorption and cross-relaxation processes since the absorption and emission cross-section from Er3+ 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition strongly overlap.51–53

4. Conclusion
Er3+ and Er3+/Yb3+-doped tellurite glass were synthesized, and the role of Yb3+ on the visible upconversion emission efficiency of Er3+ was discussed. Transparent to opaque glass-ceramics of Er3+/Yb3+-codoped glass were prepared by controlled heat-treatment above Tg. A cubic phase of Bi2Te4O11 nanocrystals was homogeneously precipitated, as evidenced by XRD and HRTEM. Structural changes were observed through Raman analysis as a function of HT time. This fact directly affects the up-conversion luminescent properties of glass-ceramics when compared to Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped glasses. The emission band intensities in the green and red increase in intensity as a function of HT time. The formation of low phonon energy nanocrystals around the rare earth ions reduces the non-radiative transitions, leading to an increase in the lifetime of green emission up to the GC-60 sample. On the other hand, under long HT times, the vicinity of the RE3+ ions arising from the crystallization of the glass matrix promotes back-transfer or cross relaxation processes, as evidenced by the increase of the intensity of the red emission band and the shortening of the lifetime above 60 min of HT. Based on these results, it seems that TGKB glass doped with rare-earth ions are promising materials to be luminescent hosts.
