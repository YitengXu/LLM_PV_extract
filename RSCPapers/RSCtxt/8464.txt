    , Accepted 16th March 2016First published on 17th March 2016AbstractAn alternating copolymer (P(IDT-NDI)) containing indacenodithienothiophene (IDT) and naphthalene diimide (NDI) units was synthesized for application as an acceptor material in all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). The polymer possesses a low bandgap of 1.51 eV, a suitable LUMO level of −3.84 eV and a HOMO level of −5.75 eV for use as an acceptor material instead of PCBM. Three conjugated polymers including J50 and J51 with a medium bandgap (ca. 1.9 eV) and PTB7-Th with a low bandgap (1.59 eV) were selected as donor materials for the investigation of the photovoltaic performance of the nonfullerene acceptor P(IDT-NDI). The champion all-PSCs with P(IDT-NDI) as an acceptor demonstrated power conversion efficiencies of 3.63%, 4.12% and 5.33% for the polymer donors PTB7-Th, J50 and J51, respectively. The results indicate that the complementary absorption of the polymer donor with polymer acceptor is very important for high performance all-PSCs and P(IDT-NDI) is a promising polymer acceptor for all-PSCs.
Introduction
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), utilizing a blend of p-type conjugated polymers as a donor and n-type conjugated polymers as an acceptor, were first fabricated and studied in 1995,1 almost starting at the same time as the PSCs based on conjugated polymers as a donor and fullerene derivative PCBM as an acceptor i.e. polymer/fullerene-based PSCs.2 Nevertheless, in the past 20 years, fullerene derivatives, especially PCBM and PC70BM, have been predominantly used as the acceptors in PSCs, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs increased gradually from less than 1% (ref. 2) to over 10% recently.3–7 However, the all-PSCs developed slowly8 due to a lack of high performance n-type conjugated polymer acceptor materials and device optimization of the all-PSCs. Replacing fullerene acceptors with n-type polymers can provide advantages, such as being easily-accessible, and having a facile solution processing, strong absorption in the visible region, and easily adjustable energy levels.8–11 Thus, to enhance the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), n-type polymers with appropriate energy levels, such as perylene diimide, naphthalene diimide, and naphthodithiophene diimide based copolymers are investigated as polymer acceptors.12–25 Also, different approaches including polymer donor screening,26–28 morphological control,29–31 as well as interface engineering32 are also investigated to improve the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs. With these efforts, the PCE of all-PSCs has steadily improved.19,26,29,32–36
Despite this progress, less success has been achieved for all-PSCs than the polymer/fullerene-based PSCs. Among the n-type conjugated polymer acceptors, naphthalene diimide-arylene copolymers have been well-studied in all-PSCs due to their high electron mobility, high electron affinity and light absorption ability at the near-infrared region.28,36,37 By developing new polymer donors and morphology control, device efficiency has steadily improved up to 2–8% in the last few years.28,29,33,36 The exploration of new polymer acceptors with suitable energy levels and broader absorptions can promise new opportunities to further enhance the efficiency of all-PSCs.
Indacenodithienothiophene (IDT) units are promising building blocks for photovoltaic materials owing to their rigid and coplanar structure.38–41 In addition, the tetrahexylphenyl groups of the IDT backbones ensure that the IDT based photovoltaic acceptor material has solution processability and can suppress their aggregation in the solid state. Based on these unique features, a series of Acceptor–Donor–Acceptor (A–D–A) type small molecule acceptors that utilize IDT units as the core and different electron-withdrawing units as end-capping groups were developed recently.42–47 The designed A–D–A structure provides an effective way to tune energy levels by introducing end-capping groups with different electron-withdrawing abilities, and the PSCs with an organic molecule acceptor demonstrated high PCEs in the range of 3–6%.42,43 For example, with 2-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-ylmethylene)malononitrile (BM) as the end-capping group, Zhan et al. synthesized IDT-2BM (structure shown in Fig. 1), and the PSCs with IDT-2BM as the acceptor and the low bandgap polymer PTB7-Th (see Fig. 3a) as the donor component achieved a high efficiency of 4.26%.48
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of the photovoltaic acceptor materials: IDT-2BN and P(IDT-NDI). 
On the basis of the consideration of the unique function of IDT, in this work we incorporated IDT as a building block in NDI based copolymers and synthesized an alternating D–A copolymer, P(IDT-NDI), for application as acceptor materials in all-PSCs. In P(IDT-NDI), the extended fused-ring of the IDT unit is beneficial to π-electron delocalization, which may enhance the charge carrier mobility, reduce the bandgap and broaden the absorption of the conjugated polymer. The steric effect of tetrahexylphenyl substituents on the polymer backbone can reduce intermolecular interactions, and thus may prevent polymer acceptor over aggregation in the active layers.
Results and discussion

P(IDT-NDI) was synthesized by Stille polycondensation of an equimolecular mixture of the dibromide NDI and distannyl IDT (Scheme 1). The details of the synthesis are described in the ESI.† The polymer is soluble in chlorinated solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene, and possesses a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 101.72 KDa, with a polydispersity index of 2.2, which was measured using high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† demonstrated a good thermal stability of the polymer with a 5% weight-loss temperature of 354 °C.

Fig. 2a shows the absorption spectra of P(IDT-NDI) film. The absorption peak at around 380 nm could originate from n–π* transitions or backbone absorption, while the maximum absorption of the copolymer at 730 nm corresponds to a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the NDI and IDT units. The absorption edge of P(IDT-NDI) is at 820 nm, corresponding to a bandgap of 1.51 eV.

The electronic energy levels of P(IDT-NDI) were measured using electrochemical cyclic voltammetry.49 Its HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels were calculated from the onset oxidation (φox) and onset reduction (φred) potentials obtained from its cyclic voltammogram (as shown in Fig. 2b), according to the equations: EHOMO = −e(φox − φFc/Fc+ + 4.80) (eV) and ELUMO = −e(φred − φFc/Fc+ + 4.80) (eV), where the unit of potential is V vs. Ag/AgCl and the potential of Fc/Fc+ (φFc/Fc+) measured in 0.1 mol L−1n-Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution is 0.39 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The φox and φred are 1.34 and −0.57 V vs. Ag/AgCl respectively, then the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P(IDT-NDI) are −5.75 and −3.84 eV respectively.
The photovoltaic properties of the P(IDT-NDI) polymer acceptor were investigated using the narrow bandgap polymer PTB7-Th50 and the medium bandgap polymer J50 (ref. 51) or J51 (ref. 51) as the polymer donor in bulk heterojunction devices with a device structure of ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate)/polymer donor:P(IDT-NDI)/PDINO (perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide)/Al. PDINO was used as the cathode buffer layer due to its high performance in polymer solar cells.52 The molecular structures of the polymer donors of PTB7-Th, J50 and J51 are shown in Fig. 3a. Details of the device fabrication conditions and device characterizations are described in the ESI.† The low bandgap polymer PTB7-Th was tested as the polymer donor because of its success as a polymer donor in nonfullerene photovoltaic devices. Medium bandgap polymers J50 and J51 have similar absorption profiles and were chosen as the polymer donor because of the complementary absorption of their main peak absorption with that of P(IDT-NDI) (see Fig. 2a) and their high performance in all-PSCs with N2200 as the polymer acceptor.35 Recently, the complementary absorption of the donor/acceptor pair has been regarded as one of the most important factors in providing a wide photo-responsive range for fabricating efficient all-PSCs.35,53
 Fig. 3  (a) Chemical structures of the photovoltaic donor materials, and (b) energy levels diagram of the photovoltaic materials. 

Fig. 3b shows the electronic energy levels diagram of the polymer donor and acceptor materials. The LUMO energy level difference between the polymer donor and polymer acceptor P(IDT-NDI) is 0.2 eV for PTB7-Th, 0.68 eV for J50 and 0.76 eV for J51, while the HOMO energy level difference between the polymer donor and polymer acceptor P(IDT-NDI) is 0.53 eV for PTV7-Th, 0.62 eV for J50 and 0.49 eV for J51. The results indicate that the three polymer donors, especially J50 and J51, are suitable donor materials for the P(IDT-NDI) polymer acceptor from the energy level matching point of view. To further confirm the matching of the polymer donor with the acceptor of P(IDT-NDI), we measured the photoluminescence (PL) quenching behaviour of the polymer donor by the polymer acceptor, as shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† The respective PL peaks of the polymer donors are at ca. 660 nm for J50 and J51, and 806 nm for PTB7-Th. When P(IDT-NDI) was blended with the polymer donor, its PL spectra were largely quenched (see the PL spectra of the blend films in Fig. S3 in the ESI†), suggesting effective charge transfer from the polymer donors of J50, J51 and PTB7-Th to P(IDT-NDI).
The photovoltaic performance of the all-PSCs was optimized by changing the weight ratios of the polymer donor:P(IDT-NDI) acceptor (D:A) in the active layers from 1:1 to 3:1. The active layers were prepared by spin-coating the polymer blend solution with a total blend polymer concentration of 12 mg mL−1 in chloroform. The active layer thickness was ca. 100 nm. The photovoltaic performance data of the all-PSCs with different D:A weight ratios are listed in Tables S1–S3 in the ESI.† Clearly, 1.4:1 seems to be the optimal D:A weight ratio for J50:P(IDT-NDI) while 2:1 is the optimal D:A weight ratio for PTB7-Th:P(IDT-NDI) and J51:P(IDT-NDI). At the optimized weight ratio, the photovoltaic performance of the all-PSCs was further optimized using DIO solvent additive and a thermal annealing treatment at 110 °C for 30 min. Fig. 4a–c show the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best all-PSCs with the optimized D:A weight ratios under the illumination of AM1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic performance parameters of the corresponding devices are summarized and compared in Table 1.

To compare the three kinds of all-PSCs with different polymer donor materials (see Table 1), the VOC values of the devices with J51 and PTB7-Th as donor reached ca. 0.9 V, which is ca. 0.1 V higher than that of the device with J50 as a donor. The higher VOC values of the PTB7-Th and J51-based device benefit from the lower lying HOMO energy levels of the two polymer donor materials. Without the solvent additive, the as-cast all-PSCs exhibit a relatively low performance with a PCE of only 1.60% for the device based on J50:P(IDT-NDI) (1.4:1, w/w), 1.88% for the device based on PTB7-Th:P(IDT-NDI) (2:1, w/w) and 3.08% for the device based on J51:P(IDT-NDI) (2:1, w/w). The addition of 1% DIO to the chloroform solution dramatically improved the devices’ performances, mainly because of their significantly increased short circuit currents (from 4.89 to 7.79 mA cm−2 for the J50-based device, from 5.12 to 7.22 mA cm−2 for the PTB7-Th-based device and from 7.65 to 8.60 mA cm−2 for the J51-based device). The efficiencies of the devices were further dramatically increased after thermal treatment at 110 °C for 30 min, resulting in a PCE of 4.12% together with a JSC of 9.68 mA cm−2 for the J50-based champion device, a PCE of 3.63% together with a JSC of 7.35 mA cm−2 for the PTB7-Th-based champion device and a PCE of 5.33% together with a JSC of 9.55 mA cm−2 for the J51-based champion device.
It should be mentioned that the VOC values of the all-PSCs with P(IDT-NDI) as an acceptor are ca. 0.1–0.2 V higher than that of the corresponding PSCs with PC70BM as an acceptor.50,51 For the PC70BM-based PSCs, the VOC values were 0.58, 0.75 and 0.80 V for the PSCs with J50, J51 and PTB7-Th as the donor, respectively50,51 (see Table S4 in the ESI†), while the VOC values of the P(IDT-NDI)-based all-PSCs with an optimized D:A weight ratio reached 0.78, 0.93 and 0.91 V for the polymer donors J50, J51 and PTB7-Th respectively (see Table 1). The higher VOC values of the all-PSCs should benefit from the higher LUMO energy level (−3.84 eV) of the polymer acceptor P(IDT-NDI) in comparison with that (−3.91 eV)54 of PC71BM.

Fig. 4d–f show the IPCE spectra of the best all-PSCs with P(IDT-NDI) as the polymer acceptor. The calculated JSC values for the best devices are 9.27 mA cm−2 for the J50-based device, 7.41 mA cm−2 for the PTB7-Th-based device and 9.50 mA cm−2 for the J51-based device, which agree well with those values obtained from the J–V curves (Table 1). The IPCE curves of the three devices show a broad response from 300–850 nm with peak values approaching ca. 50% for the J50-based device, approaching 55% for the J51-based device and approaching 38% for the PTB7-Th-based device under the optimized conditions. The IPCE spectra clearly show that both the polymer donor and acceptor components contribute to photocurrent generation. Compared with those of the PTB7-Th-based devices, the higher IPCE values of the J50-and 51-based devices in the wavelength range of 300–650 nm should be ascribed to the contribution of the strong absorption of the polymer donor (J50, J51) and can account for its higher photocurrent. The results indicate that the complementary absorption of the donor and acceptor components is indeed important for higher photocurrent in the all-PSCs.
In order to understand the origin of the device performance improvement by the treatments of the DIO additive and thermal annealing, we measured the charge carrier mobilities and the morphology of the active layers without and with the treatments. The hole and electron mobilities of the active layers were measured using the space charge limited current model, and the results are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI,† and the calculated hole and electron mobilities are listed in Table S5 in the ESI.† After the treatments of 1% DIO additive and thermal annealing, the charge carrier mobilities were increased, in particular the electron mobility was increased greatly, and the balance between the hole and electron transportation was improved significantly. For example, for the PSCs based on J51:P(IDT-NDI), the hole mobility (μh) was increased from 4.23 to 6.58 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, the electron mobility (μe) was increased from 1.49 to 3.06 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the ratio of μh:μe was reduced from 2.84 to 2.15 after the treatments (see Table S5 in the ESI†). Therefore, the improved device performances can be ascribed to their enhanced and more balanced hole/electron mobilities after the treatments of the DIO additive and thermal annealing.
Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the surface morphology of the active layer of the all-PSCs, as shown in Fig. 5. According to the AFM images, the as-cast J50:P(IDT-NDI) film shows a uniform film with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.80 nm. The thermally treated blend film with 1% DIO exhibits a rougher surface with a RMS roughness of 1.08 nm. The PTB7-Th:P(IDT-NDI) and the J51:P(IDT-NDI) active layers show the same trends: RMS values of 0.89 nm for the as-cast film and 4.69 nm for the optimized blend film for PTB7-Th:P(IDT-NDI); and RMS values of 1.71 nm for the as-cast film and 2.09 nm for the optimized blend film for J51:P(IDT-NDI). The grain size increased gradually, indicating more enhanced aggregation due to the thermal treatments which may help charge carrier transportation and collection.

Conclusions
An alternating copolymer P(IDT-NDI), with IDT and NDI as building blocks, was synthesized for application as an acceptor material in all-PSCs. The polymer possesses suitable HOMO/LUMO energy levels of −5.75/−3.84 eV for the polymer acceptor, and a lower band gap of 1.51 eV. The photovoltaic properties of the P(IDT-NDI) acceptor were investigated using J50, J51 or PTB7-Th as the polymer donor in all-PSCs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer donor:P(IDT-NDI)/PDINO/Al. The PCE values of the champion all-PSCs reached 3.63% for the PTB7-Th-based device), 4.12% for the J50-based device, and 5.33% for the J51-based device. The good photovoltaic performance of the all-PSCs based on J51:P(IDT-NDI) could be ascribed to the complementary absorption of the polymer donor and acceptor in the visible-NIR region (which is responsible for the higher JSC), relatively lower-lying HOMO of J51 and relatively high-lying LUMO of P(IDT-NDI) (which is beneficial to the higher VOC), and a good donor/acceptor interpenetrating network. The results further confirm that the complementary absorption and matching HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the polymer donor and polymer acceptor are very important for improving the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs.
