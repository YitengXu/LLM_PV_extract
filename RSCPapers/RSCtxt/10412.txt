    , Accepted 16th September 2013First published on 17th September 2013AbstractAn efficient broadband excited near-infrared to visible up-conversion is observed in LaF3:Ho3+ as the result of a two-wavelength excitation. The visible up-conversion emission intensity is greatly enhanced upon simultaneous excitation at 970 nm and 1150 nm, due to an energy transfer up-conversion mechanism. Multi-wavelength excitation based on the ground-state absorption, excited-state absorption, and phonon-coupled absorption of rare-earth ions results in an efficient broadband excited up-conversion emission, which may provide a new approach to fully harvest NIR solar energy and has potential application in solar cells.
1 Introduction
Photon up-conversion (UC) from the near-infrared (NIR) to visible light in rare-earth (RE) doped materials has generated tremendous research interest, much of it focused on applications including photovoltaics, color displays, and biological imaging.1–6 The idea of adding an UC layer at the rear face of a photovoltaic device is very promising for enhancing the conversion efficiency of solar cells.7 However, the efficiencies of UC solar cells obtained experimentally have been extremely low and these merely serve as a proof of principle. The problem is that the efficiency of UC is very low, and the excitation spectral region is very narrow, in contrast to the solar spectrum, due to the nature of the 4f–4f transitions in RE ions. However, in solution, UC becomes broadband.8,9 Recently, Zou et al. reported the use of a cyanine dye molecule that enables the broadband excitation of NaYF4 nanoparticles co-doped with Yb3+ sensitizer and Er3+ activator ions due to an energy transfer between the dye and Yb3+ ions.8 However, indirect excitation through heterogeneous energy transfer suffers from competitive energy loss. Moreover, the poor photostability of the dye hinders its application for long-term solar irradiation.10 Alternatively, Chen et al. demonstrated that broadband NIR photons excited to the visible-NIR region are up-converted due to a combination of the absorption bands of different RE ions through core–shell nanofabrication, i.e., Er3+:NaGdF4@Ho3+:NaGdF4@NaGdF4.11 However, it's hard to fully harvest solar energy, which has a continuous energy distribution, due to the discrete characteristic absorptions of RE ions. Moreover, heterogeneous doping will inevitably cause detrimental energy transfers between RE ions. Hence, it's necessary to find a new way to realize broadband excitation aimed at the complete utilization of solar energy.
Moreover, an up-converted emission with a high conversion efficiency is necessary for practical applications. One approach is to use multi-wavelength excitation. Energy transfer UC (ETU) between excited neighboring ions and excited-state absorption (ESA) can enhance the UC efficiency by decreasing the losses due to energy mismatches, in contrast to using a single wavelength. The creation of a blue-green UC laser has been achieved using a two-wavelength (one red and one NIR) pumping technique.12
In the case of solar energy, solar pumping can be considered as multi-wavelength excitation because the different wavelengths of light arrive at the same time. Herein, we propose a new strategy to enhance the UC emission efficiency and realize broadband excitation using RE ions through simultaneous two or multi-wavelength excitation. Ho3+ is used as an example RE ion, since its energy levels possess the ability to realize both NIR excitation and visible UC luminescence. Moreover, Ho3+ has relatively long-lived 5I7 and 5I6 excited states that can act as population reservoirs for UC processes.13 LaF3, which has a phonon cutoff frequency of approximately 350 cm−1 and is a typical laser medium, is chosen as a host for efficient UC.14 We show that, by excitation with 970 nm and 1150 nm light, an intensive visible UC luminescence can be achieved. The UC mechanisms are elucidated through power dependence studies and lifetime measurements on samples under single-wavelength and two-wavelength excitation. Our approach, which possesses the features of broadband absorption and simultaneous excitation, is a new way to achieve efficient broadband excited UC emissions, and has the potential to enhance the conversion efficiency of solar cells.
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation of LaF3:Ho3+ phosphors
LaF3:Ho3+ (1, 5, 10 and 50 mol%) phosphors were prepared using a solid-state reaction method under a N2 gas atmosphere. Stoichiometric amounts of LaF3 (99.99%), HoF3 (99.99%), and 10 wt% NH4HF2 (98%) were mixed, ground together, and then sintered at 1100 °C for 3 hours.
2.2 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
XRD analysis was carried out using a RIGAKU D/MAX 2550/PC diffractometer (Japan) with a slit of 0.02° at a scanning speed of 5° min−1 using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å).
2.3 UC luminescence spectroscopy
The NIR excited UC emission and lifetime measurements of the phosphors were performed using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS900 steady/transient-state fluorescence spectrometer at room temperature. For the 970 nm excited UC emissions, a continuous wave semiconductor laser diode emitting at 970 nm was used. For the 1150 nm and two-wavelength (970 nm and 1150 nm) excited UC emissions and lifetime measurements, a tunable optical parametric oscillator (OPO) pumped using the third harmonic wavelength (355 nm) of a Q-switched YAG:Nd laser. The laser was tuned to 1150 nm in order to excite the samples with a 5 ns pulse at a repetition rate of 10 Hz.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure
XRD patterns showing reflections representative of pure phase LaF3 are observed when different concentrations of Ho3+ ions (0, 1, 5, 10 and 50 mol%) are doped into the samples (Fig. 1).

3.2 UC upon 970 nm excitation
During 970 nm laser excitation at room temperature, green emissions were observed from the Ho3+ doped LaF3 powders. The intensity of these up-converted emissions depend on the doping concentration of Ho3+, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The characteristic green and red emissions can be ascribed to the 5F4, 5S2 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5I8 transitions of Ho3+, respectively. The intensities of both the green and red emissions decreased as the Ho3+ concentration increased from 1 mol% to 50 mol%, which implies that there is an ever-present concentration quenching effect. Quantitative comparisons of the green and red emission intensities versus the concentration of Ho3+, are shown in Fig. 2(b). A sharper decrease of the green emission compared to the red emission causes a decrease of green/red intensity ratio. This may be due to the energy migration and loss of intra ions. In an attempt to analyse the energy migration process, we measured the power dependent UC intensity in LaF3:Ho3+ (1 mol%), as shown in Fig. 2(c). The plots of the green and red emissions versus the laser power exhibit gradients of 1.48. This indicates that more than one photon is responsible for populating the green and red emission levels. We suggest that the 970 nm laser excites the phonon-coupled levels of the 5I6 state first, as shown in Fig. 2(d),15 followed by a second sequential photon excitation to the 5F4 and 5S2 levels, which is responsible for generating the up-converted green emission and was previously confirmed in a Lu3Al5O12 host.16 For the red emission, population of the 5F5 level by multiphoton non-radiative relaxation from the 5F4 and 5S2 levels is not possible because of the large energy gap (∼3000 cm−1) compared to the maximum phonon energy of LaF3 (∼350 cm−1).15 This could be confirmed by spectroscopy, which demonstrates that red emission is much weaker than green emission in the LaF3 powders doped with lower concentrations of Ho3+, while the inverse intensity ratio was found in Lu3Al5O12.16 In our case, the green/red intensity ratio decreases when the doping concentration of Ho3+ increases. This implies that cross relaxation occurs (CR1: 5F4, 5S2 + 5I8 → 5I4 + 5I7), as shown in Fig. 2(d), which results in a decrease of the green emission.17 Since the 5I7 level possesses a longer lifetime of >10 ms, subsequent up-converted red emission occurs due to the excited state absorption of one 970 nm photon.18 In addition, the concentration dependent red emission quenching may be due to a sequential non-radiative relaxation from the 5F5 level to the 5I5 level followed by cross relaxation (CR2: 5I5 + 5I8 → 5I7 + 5I7).17

3.3 UC upon 1150 nm excitation
Upon 1150 nm excitation, the same transitions of Ho3+ (5S2 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5I8) are observed compared to the case of 970 nm excitation, however, the red emission is more intense than the green emission, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The green and red emissions have optimum intensities at 5 mol% Ho3+ (Fig. 3(b)). When the Ho3+ concentration is increased above this value, the UC emissions becomes less efficient. This can be explained by the appearance of concentration quenching based upon cross relaxations between neighbouring ions. The transient evolution of the emission helps us to achieve a better understanding of the UC emission mechanism. As shown in Fig. 3(c) and its inset, the transient evolution of the emission at 650 nm in LaF3:Ho3+ (5 mol%) exhibits an initial rise before decaying. If sequential two-photon excitation was the only mechanism in UC, then the red emission should not demonstrate any rise time because the pulse width of the excitation laser is only 10 ns. The initial rise is related to a non-radiative phonon relaxation that causes population of the 5F5 energy level, even during the absence of a laser pulse, as depicted in Fig. 3(d). The decay section could be fitted using a tri-exponential equation corresponding to decay mechanisms occurring via different depopulation channels. The average decay time was determined using the following equation:19 (1)where Ai and τi are the amplitude and lifetime corresponding to the level of the depopulation channel i, respectively, and n = 3. The calculated average decay time is equal to 1.2 ms. For the green emission, its relative weak intensity limits the measurement of the transient emission. A possible three-photon related UC process, along with the cascade relaxation 5G5 → 5F3 → 5S2, is shown in Fig. 3(d), which is in agreement with the transition probability distribution observed from the emission spectra.15

3.4 UC upon two-wavelength co-excitation (970 nm + 1150 nm)
Two laser beams were focused onto the same point of a sample to simulate the principle of broadband excitation. The characteristic green and red emissions can be ascribed to the 5F4, 5S2 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5I8 transitions of Ho3+ and are similar to those observed in the single-wavelength excitation cases (Fig. 2(a) and 3(a)). Both the 5F4, 5S2 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5I8 emission are greatly enhanced in comparison with the single-wavelength excitation cases, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Fig. 4(b) shows the enhancement of the intensity ratio between the two-wavelength excitation case and the single-wavelength excitation cases, i.e., 5.4 and 25-fold enhancements for the green emission and 43.6 and 38.6-fold enhancements for the red emission for the 970 nm and 1150 nm excitation, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the transient emission at 650 nm in LaF3:Ho3+ (1 mol%) upon co-excitation exhibits much longer rise and decay times compared to the 1150 nm excitation. Typically a delayed rise time is a clear indicator of an energy transfer process. Thus, we can attribute this behavior to the preferential population of the 5F5 level of neighbouring ions, which are heterogeneously excited, as shown as the ETU process in Fig. 4(d),20,21 which is different to the ESA populations in the single-wavelength excitation cases (Fig. 2(d) and 3(d)). A pair of Ho3+ ions, which are initially both excited to the intermediate 5I6 level; in a second step one Ho3+ ion non-radiatively transfers its excitation energy to its partner which is thus excited to the 5F5 level in the visible. Considering an ion pair with three levels, 1, 2 and 3, which correspond to the 5I8, 5I6, and 5F5 levels, respectively, the transient process could be modeled as the difference between two exponential components as follow:21,22 I(t) = k(exp(−(2W2 + Wt)t) − exp(−W3t))(2)where k is a constant and W2 and W3 are the intrinsic single ion decay rate constants of levels 2 and 3, respectively. Wt is the rate constant of the energy transfer. The decay rate is determined by the lesser rate of W3 (or 2W2 + Wt), while the greater of the two rates describes the rise. The average rise time of in the two-wavelength excitation case is calculated to be 0.77 ms, while the average decay time is 13 ms. In the 1150 nm excitation case, the average decay time is 1.1 ms, while the rise time is too short to be calculated. Similar transient behaviour was observed for the green emission, where the average rise time and decay time are 0.36 ms and 5.2 ms, respectively, upon two-wavelength excitation. Thus, as shown in Fig. 4(d), the ETU process 5I6 + 5I6 → 5I8 + 5F4, 5S2, can be attributed to the green emission mechanism. The shorter rise time of green emission compared to red emission, is in agreement with the emission intensity enhancement. The reason for this is that for a higher emission efficiency, photons have to interact with the medium for a longer time.22

(d) An energy level diagram showing the two-wavelength excited UC mechanism of Ho3+ in LaF3. 
In order to obtain further insight into the reasons for the large emission enhancement from single-wavelength to two-wavelength excitation, we further compared the UC luminescence dynamic processes of the two-wavelength excitation in different LaF3:Ho3+ samples (1 mol%, 10 mol%, and 50 mol%), as shown in Fig. 5. The relatively strong emission at 650 nm was chosen as a typical example in order to analyze the mechanism by transient evolution. It can be clearly observed that the initial state of the transient evolution changed from a slow rise to a sharp decay with increasing Ho3+ concentration. In addition, there is an intermediate state, which combines the sharp decay and slow rise in the 10 mol% Ho3+ doped LaF3 sample. This implies the coexistence of ETU and ESA in the UC process. ETU is the most efficient of the various two-photon UC processes because it is closest to the full resonance case.15 Thus, ETU processes show greater enhancements in their UC emissions than ESA processes, which is in accordance with the enhancement of the ratio of the emission intensity from 1 mol% to 50 mol% Ho3+ doping (see inset). Moreover, an apparent enhancement could be observed from single-wavelength to two-wavelength excitation in LaF3:Ho3+ (50 mol%) despite only ESA participating in the population of the 5F4, 5S2 and 5F5 states. This is because the excitation energies of 1150 nm and 970 nm are in good agreement with the energies the 5I8 → 5I6, and 5I6 → 5F4,5, 5S2 transitions of Ho3+, respectively, which decreases the energy mismatch of the two-photon UC process.

3.5 Broadband UC based on multi-wavelength co-excitation
In principle, the solar spectrum is composed of numerous continuously distributed single wavelengths. Hence, the concept of a broadband UC based on multi-wavelength excitation leads to solar pumping as a possible approach for efficient UC. As illustrated in Fig. 6, NIR solar energy represented by the blue solid line could be absorbed by the 5I6 and 5I5 levels of Ho3+ for further excitation to higher energy levels in order to realize visible UC emission.15 In addition, the blue dotted lines show the NIR energy harvested via ESA and phonon-coupled absorption (PCA), which works the same way as in the 970 nm excited UC case (Fig. 2). With the simultaneous arrival of solar energy to the material surface, the aforementioned processes work together to harvest a broad band of light and emit efficiently. Recently reported results concerning the enhanced photocatalytic activity of YF3:Yb3+,Tm3+/TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles under NIR solar irradiation may be an example that shows the feasibility of using a broadband solar pumping method.23

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, an efficient broadband excited NIR to visible up-conversion was demonstrated using the two-wavelength excitation of LaF3:Ho3+. Efficient visible emissions were achieved by two-step population processes, i.e., the ground state absorption occurs through 970 nm and 1150 nm excitation and then an energy transfer up-conversion occurs between neighbouring Ho3+ ions. Successful modeling of the broadband excited up-conversion has been achieved through numerous continuously distributed single wavelength simultaneous excitations, describing a feasible concept for solar pumping up-conversion. This may find potential applications in solar cells to improve the conversion efficiency and should be useful for the design of UC converters containing other RE active centers.
