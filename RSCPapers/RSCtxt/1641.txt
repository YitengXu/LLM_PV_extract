    , Accepted 16th January 2021First published on 18th January 2021AbstractLead halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are emerging as promising light-conversion materials for light-emitting diode (LED) display applications. However, the practical application of PNCs is hindered by their labile surface and dynamic ionic ligand binding. Here, we report a post-synthetic surface passivation strategy to stabilize the CsPbBr3 PNCs by zinc methacrylate (ZnMA) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) co-passivation. Surface analyses reveal that the ZnMA stabilizes the PNCs by replacing the surface ammonium ligands, and TOPO further coordinates to the ZnMA to provide a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the PNCs. Moreover, the ZnMA capping on the PNC surface could participate in the polymerization of MMA to form a crosslinked polymer shell around the PNCs. The resultant PNCs–PMMA film presents a PLQY of 74% and maintains a constant PL intensity under continuous UV irradiation in air, while the PNCs–PMMA film made of classical PNCs quickly degrades. The prepared PNCs–PMMA film was tested as the light down-conversion layer in LED backlighting and presented photostability comparable to classical CdSe/ZnS NCs–PMMA under continuous illumination. This surface passivation strategy avoids the use of ionic ligands for the surface passivation of PNCs in polymer matrices, and we expect related surface chemistry to promote the performance enhancement of diverse PNCs–polymer composites for LEDs and other optoelectronic applications.
Introduction
All-inorganic lead halide perovskites have attracted widespread research interest in applications such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs),1–3 solar cells,4,5 photodetectors,6,7 and lasers8,9 due to their superior optical properties. In particular, PNCs are promising candidates for lighting and display applications owing to their high PLQY, color tunability within the visible region, narrow emission and large absorption coefficient.10,11 Despite the extraordinary optical properties, the practical application of PNCs is limited due to their ionic structure and labile surface in the presence of air, moisture and polar solvents.12–14 Scientists have made great efforts to enhance the environmental stability of PNCs via surface encapsulation with air and moisture barrier materials, such as metal oxides,15,16 metal organic frameworks17,18 and ceramics.19–21 Organic polymers with hydrophobic characteristics have been proven to be an effective barrier to enhance the stability of PNCs.22–24 The polymer cladding also endows the PNCs with improved optical properties, mechanical performance and compatibility to optoelectronic device processing.
To date, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is the most widely used polymer for the encapsulation of PNCs because of its excellent optical properties, water resistance and compatibility to device manufacturing.25,26 PNCs–PMMA composites usually serve as light down-conversion thin films in LED device fabrication.27 In recent studies, the color gamut of LEDs based on PNCs–PMMA composites has reached 129% of the National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard, which show great potential as an advanced display backlight.28 In the common approach, the PNCs were mixed with an MMA monomer or PMMA in an organic solvent and the PNCs–PMMA film was formed after polymerization and solvent evaporation.29–31 However, post-synthetic washing of PNCs during the mixing process usually induces agglomeration of PNCs, resulting in fluorescence quenching and a color shift. Recent studies have intended to solve this issue by performing one-pot synthesis of PNCs in MMA monomers.32,33 Xin et al. reported the synthesis of perovskite NCs directly in MMA.34 This technique integrates the formation of perovskite crystals and a polymer matrix in a reaction vessel to avoid the lengthy separation and preparation processes of the perovskite. The resultant PNCs–PMMA composites presented highly improved efficiency and moisture resistance. Nevertheless, the long-term stability of the PNCs–PMMA composite remains unsatisfactory because of the residual amine and acid in the composite. These ligands are commonly employed to guarantee a high PLQY and monodispersity of PNCs in the reaction solution and polymer matrices. The ligands bind to the PNC surface as ionic pairs which is dynamic and easy to dissociate in a polar environment.35,36 In particular, ammonium/amine ligands are considered the essential factor for the surface instability due to their weak binding strength to the surface halide and facile proton exchange.37,38 To stabilize the ligand capping, a ligand with polymerizable groups or a multidentate structure was employed to form a robust and crosslinked ligand shell. For example, Sun et al. developed vinylbenzyl functionalized ammonium salt as a ligand for synthesizing PNCs.39 The vinyl group could participate in the polymerization of MMA to stabilize the PNCs in the PMMA composite. Jiang et al. employed combined hydrolyzed PMMA and multidentate poly(ethylenimine) as a dual ligand to passivate CsPbBr3–CsPb2Br5 PNCs.40 The prepared PNCs–PMMA film presented a PLQY of 65% and a noticeable improvement in water resistance and thermal stability. However, these reactions still involve ionic ligands and it remains challenging to achieve a PNCs–PMMA composite film with a high PLQY and long-term stability in the presence of oxygen, moisture and illumination.
In this work, we employ ZnMA and TOPO for the post-synthetic surface treatment of PNCs. Surface analyses reveal that the ZnMA binds to the PNC surface by replacing the original ammonium ligand, and TOPO further interacts with ZnMA to reinforce the surface passivation. The ZnMA–TOPO co-passivation effectively improves the PLQY and the stability of the PNCs in air and polar solvents. More importantly, the ZnMA on the surface is able to participate in the polymerization of MMA to form a highly dense composite shell around PNCs. The resultant PNCs–PMMA film presents a high PLQY of 74% and maintains a constant PL intensity under continuous UV irradiation in air, while the PNCs–PMMA film made of conventional PNCs degrades quickly under the same condition. This method avoids the use of amine/ammonium ligands in the postsynthetic treatment of PNCs and achieves enhanced PLQY and stability of PNCs by employing metal carboxylate ligands with polymerizable groups. The surface passivation strategy paves a new way for the development of efficient and stable PNCs–polymer composite films for LED and other optoelectronic applications.
Experimental details
Materials
Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, >99.9%), lead bromide (PbBr2, >98%) and zinc methacrylate (ZnMA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; oleylamine (OLA, 90%) was purchased from Aladdin; 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%) and oleic acid (OA, >90%) were purchased from TCI chemicals. Methyl methacrylate (MMA, 99.0%) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO, 98%) were purchased from Macklin and used without any further purification. 2,2-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) was purchased from Damao Chemical Reagent Factory China. CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals (NCs) with a PLQY of 85% were purchased from Mesolight Inc (Suzhou, China).
Preparation of the Cs-oleate precursor
Cs-oleate was prepared following a previously reported method.41 2.5 mmol Cs2CO3, 40 ml ODE and 2.5 ml OA were loaded into a 100 ml three-neck flask and heated to 150 °C under nitrogen until the reaction was complete to obtain the Cs-oleate solution, which was cooled to 20 °C and placed in a glass bottle for later use.
Synthesis of CsPbBr3 PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO
The CsPbBr3 PNCs were synthesized via hot injection as previously reported.42 Typically, 5 mL octadecene (ODE), 0.5 mL oleylamine (OLA), 0.5 mL oleic acid (OA) and 0.188 mmol (0.069 g) lead bromide (PbBr2) were placed in a 25 ml three-neck flask and dried under vacuum for 1 h at 120 °C. After PbBr2 salt was completely dissolved under N2, the temperature was increased to 160 °C. After stirring for 10 min, 0.4 ml Cs-oleate was rapidly injected, and the mixture was cooled in a water bath after 10 seconds to room temperature, thus yielding CsPbBr3 PNCs with a concentration of 0.008 mmol ml−1.
Centrifugal and purification of PNCs
Typically, the final raw solution (2 ml) was transferred from the three-neck flask to a 10 ml plastic vial, into which ethyl acetate (4 ml) was added dropwise. After vortexing and centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min, the clean solution was discarded. The precipitate was dried under flowing N2 and redispersed in 1 ml MMA to form the PNCs–MMA solution.
ZnMA–TOPO post-treatment
10 mmol TOPO and 5 ml MMA were mixed in a glass bottle and the solution was stirred until the TOPO dissolves completely. Afterwards, 1 mmol ZnMA was added into the solution, then the solution was heated and stirred at 70 °C for 30 min until the ZnMA was completely dissolved to obtain the ZnMA–TOPO–MMA solution. 0.8 ml of the ZnMA–TOPO–MMA solution was added into 1 ml of the aforementioned purified CsPbBr3 PNCs–MMA solution in a glass bottle. The mixture was kept under vigorous stirring for an hour to obtain the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO solution.
Fabrication of PMMA composite films
AIBN was added into the PNCs–MMA solution at a weight percent of 0.005 g: 1 ml, and the solutions were stirred until the AIBN was completely dissolved. Then the solution was placed under a 365 nm UV lamp at a power density of 5 W cm−2 in an air atmosphere to initiate polymerization. When the solution becomes a glue-like colloid with a viscosity of 100–400 mPa s, it was placed on a membrane machine to make a film and the composite film was further cured under UV irradiation until complete solidification. For the preparation of CdSe/ZnS NCs–PMMA films, the CdSe/ZnS NCs were dispersed in MMA to form a NCs-MMA solution and the thin film was fabricated from the solution through the aforementioned process.
Characterization
The UV-Vis absorption and transmittance were measured using a Persee T6 UV-Vis spectrometer. Photoluminescence and stability tests were performed using an Ideaoptics FX2000-EX PL spectrometer. The PLQY measurements were carried out on an OceanOptics QEPRO QY test system under 395 nm blue laser irradiation. XRD patterns were recorded using a Rigaku X-ray power diffractometer. TEM and HRTEM images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2010 FEF. EDS (energy-dispersive spectroscopy) and elemental mapping characterization were performed on a TEM. ATR-FTIR spectra of PNCs and PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO were measured using a Thermo-Nicolet iS50 spectrometer with a broadband MCT detector. XPS was performed using a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi (American Thermo Fisher Scientific). Viscosity tests were performed on an MCR92 rheometer.
Results and discussion
CsPbBr3 PNCs were prepared by a classical hot-injection method.41 The synthesized PNCs were washed with ethyl acetate to remove excess ligands and then redispersed in MMA. ZnMA and TOPO were added into the PNCs–MMA solution at a ratio of 1:1. The mixture was kept under stirring for 1 hour to achieve complete surface passivation. Afterwards the AIBN catalyst was added into the solution to initiate polymerization under UV irradiation and form the PNCs–PMMA composite thin film. The experimental details are given in the Experimental section.
The optical properties of the prepared ZnMA and TOPO modified PNCs (PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO) in MMA were investigated by using pristine PNCs–MMA solution as the control sample. Fig. 1a shows the UV-Vis absorption and PL spectra of the two samples excited using a 405 nm laser. The PL intensities of the two samples were normalized to the same absorbance at 405 nm. The pristine PNC solution shows an emission peak at 514.7 nm and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25 nm, while the emission peak of PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO displays a slight blue-shift and a narrower FWHM of 23 nm. Besides, the luminescence intensity of PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO was significantly improved. The photographs of the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO and pristine PNCs in MMA solution under UV light illumination are shown in the inset of Fig. 1a.

(b) XRD patterns of PNCs and PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO. (c) TEM image of PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO. (d) PLQYs of PNCs (pristine in toluene), PNCs (washed in MMA), PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO, PNCs–ZnMA, and PNCs–TOPO. 

Fig. 1b shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the pristine PNCs and the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO. The clear diffraction peaks can be assigned to the cubic phase perovskite (PDF#54-0752). The two samples display similar XRD patterns, indicating the same crystal structure. As shown in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) image (Fig. 1c), the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO particles are monodisperse and have a uniform cubic shape. TEM images confirm that the good dispersion and uniform size distribution of PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO are similar to those of PNCs (Fig. S1, ESI†). The HRTEM image (Fig. S1b, ESI†) of a single PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO particle shows a clear lattice with a d-spacing of 0.45 nm, which is consistent with the (200) crystal face of cubic phase CsPbBr3.43 The structural characterization excludes the influence of the phase change on the optical properties of the PNCs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the surface capping plays a decisive role in regulating the PLQY of the PNCs in MMA.
The histogram in Fig. 1d shows the PLQY of the pristine PNCs and the PNCs modified with different surfactants. The pristine PNCs in the raw reaction solution have a high PLQY of 75%. After postsynthetic washing and redispersion of the PNCs in MMA, the PLQY drops to 43%, which is probably due to the dissociation of ligands and agglomeration of PNCs. The PLQY of the PNCs–MMA solution drops dramatically to only 5% after surface treatment with ZnMA, while the PL displays almost no change after the addition of only TOPO into the solution. In comparison, the PLQY of the PNCs achieved significant improvement to 65% by introducing a mixture of TOPO and ZnMA. Meanwhile, the transmittance of the pristine and modified PNCs was recorded (Fig. S2, ESI†). The solution of PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO displayed higher transparency than the other solutions, indicating that the ZnMA–TOPO modification not only improves the PLQY but also benefits the dispersion of the PNCs in MMA.
Stability test of modified PNCs in polar solvents
A facile experiment was conducted to evaluate the stability of the aforementioned PNC samples in a polar environment by adding alcohols into the PNCs–MMA solutions. Fig. 2a shows the fluorescence quenching of the different samples by adding ethanol. The photos and PL spectra of the pristine PNCs and the PNCs modified with ZnMA–TOPO, ZnMA and TOPO in MMA at the initial state, after the injection of ethanol and after stirring for 1 hour are provided in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†). At the time of ethanol injection (with an amount of 10% of the MMA solution), the pristine PNCs were quenched instantaneously, while the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO displayed PL quenching by about 28% and then maintained a constant luminescence during continuous stirring for 1 hour. In comparison, the PNCs treated with TOPO displayed a similar behavior to pristine PNCs with nearly complete PL quenching in ethanol. However, it is worth noting that although the PNCs with only ZnMA passivation had a weak luminescence intensity, they showed high stability against polar molecules and could even achieve PL enhancement after long-time exposure to ethanol. FTIR was conducted to explore the ligand change on PNCs and PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO after exposure to ethanol. The FTIR spectra in Fig. S5 (ESI†) show that the amine ligands on the surface of PNCs were dissociated, while the ZnMA–TOPO ligands could maintain stable binding. The results reveal that the ZnMA capping plays a critical role in stabilizing the surface of PNCs, and the TOPO benefits the efficiency and dispersion of the PNCs in MMA.

The stability of the ZnMA–TOPO modified PNCs was further investigated by mixing with different alcohols (Fig. 2b). The pristine PNCs show instant PL quenching in all alcohols, while the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO displays fluorescence quenching correlating to the polarity of the alcohols with a drop of PL intensity by 59%, 30%, 24% and 23% in methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and butanol, respectively. Nevertheless, the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO in all alcohols eventually became stable after stirring for 10 min. The PL spectra of the aforementioned samples at the initial state, after the injection of different alcohols and after stirring for 1 hour are provided in Fig. S6 (ESI†).
Surface analysis of CsPbBr3 PNCs
Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and elemental mapping characterization were conducted to identify the elemental distribution on PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO. The quantitative estimation of the element content was performed via EDS, as shown in Fig. 3a. A characteristic peak of Zn at 1.1 keV and 8.9 keV confirms the presence of ZnMA in modified PNCs, and the characteristic peak at 2.1 keV represents the P element in TOPO. Elemental mapping of the distributed PNCs (Fig. 3b and c) further displays a homogeneous distribution of Cs, Pb, Br, Zn and P elements throughout the scanned area of PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was further employed to identify the capping ligands on PNCs. Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectroscopy of the PNCs and ligands. The two peaks at 1641 cm−1 and 721 cm−1 in pristine PNCs belong to N–H stretching vibrations in oleylamine, which almost completely disappear in PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO, indicating the dissociation of the amine ligand. Meanwhile, the peak at 928 cm−1 in the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO can be assigned to the CC bond stretching vibrations inside the MMA group, suggesting the adsorption of ZnMA on PNCs. Moreover, both the pristine PNCs and PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO present strong fingerprint peaks at 1530.68 cm−1 and 1407.39 cm−1, which are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric –COO− stretching, respectively, and a group of peaks at 1452.69 cm−1 belong to the vibration of the C–H group in the long carbon chain. The FTIR spectra clearly demonstrated that the proportion of –COO− largely increased, providing evidence for the binding of an extra carboxyl group to PNCs, which is from the carboxyl groups in ZnMA. These changes in the spectra provide strong evidence that the ZnMA binds to the surface of PNCs by replacing the original amine ligands. In addition, the absorption peak located at 1143 cm−1 is observed, which corresponds to PO bond stretching vibrations in TOPO.44 This PO bond absorption peak shifts to approximately 1108 cm−1 in the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO, indicating that bonding between the perovskite and TOPO could be formed. The peak shift and weakening are also commonly observed for TOPO passivated NCs.45,46

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was further conducted to identify the chemical interaction between ZnMA–TOPO ligands and PNCs, as shown in Fig. 5. The XPS spectrum of the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO (Fig. 5a) shows the presence of Zn and P in the CsPbBr3 PNCs. Fig. 5b shows the high-resolution spectra of the Zn 2p core level in ZnMA with the original peaks at about 1022 and 1045.2 eV. In comparison, the peaks in PNCs–ZnMA obviously shift to higher binding energies by 0.22 and 0.32 eV, respectively, representing the binding of Zn to the PNC surface. Meanwhile, the Pb 4f peaks at 138.05 and 142.85 eV (Fig. 5c) and the Br 3d peaks at 67.95 and 68.85 eV (Fig. 5d) in the pristine PNCs remain at the same position, indicating that the coordinating environment on the surface Pb and Br did not change much after ligand exchange from amine to ZnMA. After introducing the TOPO ligand, the Zn 2p peaks display a large shift of 0.94 eV to a lower binding energy (0.62 eV compared to ZnMA). It is worth noting that the Pb 2p and Br 3d peaks also present a slight shift of 0.17 eV to a lower binding energy. The results suggest the coordination between the TOPO ligand and Zn2+, which increases the electron density in the Zn atomic nucleus and the entire electron density in the PNCs. The XPS spectra of the pristine and ZnMA capped PNCs, as well as the high-resolution spectrum of P 2p, are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†).

(c) Pb 4f peaks in the XPS spectra of pristine PNCs and PNCs with ZnMA and ZnMA–TOPO passivation. (d) Br 3d peaks in the XPS spectra of pristine PNCs and PNCs with ZnMA and ZnMA–TOPO passivation. All spectra were calibrated with respect to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. 
Based on the surface analysis results, we propose a reaction mechanism for ZnMA–TOPO copassivation, which is illustrated in Fig. 6. Many studies have clarified the ligand binding on the ionic surface of PNCs as a cation/anion pair, such that ammonium was adsorbed/dissociated from the surface, accompanied with an anion.47,48 In this reaction, when ammonium is replaced by ZnMA, it is probable that one methacrylate group is released by forming an ion pair with ammonium, allowing zinc-mono methacrylate to bind with surface Br. Compared to the original surface capping, zinc-methacrylate provides a more hydrophobic surface capping that renders the PNCs stable in a polar environment. Nevertheless, the zinc-mono methacrylate forms a dangling bond on the PNC surface. Previous studies revealed that the dangling bond induces additional surface trap states.49 Therefore, although the ZnMA capping effectively improves the stability of PNCs, the PL quenching occurs simultaneously with increasing nonradiative recombination.
 Fig. 6  Schematic illustration of the surface capping mechanism of ZnMA–TOPO modified PNCs. 
It is known that the coordination of positively charged metal ions with electron donor materials or Lewis bases is an effective defect-passivation method to reduce nonradiative recombination trap states.50–52 Here the dipolar TOPO provides a basic oxygen center with rich electrons that allows the binding between the oxygen atom and the Zn2+ ion in the ZnMA. Therefore, we infer that the TOPO coordinates to the surface ZnMA and elevates the PLQY of the PNCs by donating electrons to stabilize the ZnMA capping and reduce nonradiative recombination. As a result, both the stability and the PLQY of the PNCs are improved by ZnMA–TOPO copassivation.
PNCs–PMMA thin film fabrication and LED applications
PNCs are generally employed to form polymer nanocomposites for applications in LED devices. The polymer cladding provides a water and solvent barrier layer to improve the stability of PNCs. In this study, the MMA solution involving ZnMA–TOPO passivated PNCs was used directly for preparing PNCs–PMMA composite thin films using ABIN as the photo-catalyst. The ZnMA on the PNC surface can participate in the polymerization of the MMA with the vinyl group, and the crosslinked ZnMA and MMA were expected to form a uniform and stable ligand shell around the surface to further stabilize the ligand capping, as illustrated in Fig. 6. The crosslinking of the ZnMA–TOPO–PNCs in PMMA matrices was explored. After polymerization, the composite was dissolved in toluene and the PNCs were precipitated by adding ethyl acetate into the solution, centrifuged and dried in air. FTIR was conducted to analyse the surface ligands on the PNCs and the results are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The clear CC stretching peak at about 928 cm−1 in ZnMA–TOPO–PNCs disappeared, which provides evidence for the crosslinking of the PNCs in PMMA. Meanwhile, the clear peak at about 1726 cm−1 belongs to the CO stretching vibration and the peak at 1159 cm−1 belongs to the C–O and C–C coupled stretching in PMMA, which suggest that the crosslinked ZnMA and MMA could form a robust PMMA encapsulation layer on the PNC surface.53 The obtained stable PNCs–PMMA polymer composite was investigated as a remote light down-conversion thin film for fabricating LED devices. The MMA solution with pristine CsPbBr3 PNCs was also employed to form a composite film to be used as the control sample. The photostability test results of the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO and pristine PNC solution are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), which shows the superior stability of the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO in MMA compared to pristine PNCs. Therefore, the ZnMA–TOPO encapsulation effectively improves the stability of PNCs in MMA upon exposure to UV illumination and air during curing, which is consistent with previous stability test results in a polar solvent for different PNCs.
After polymerization, the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO based PMMA film displays a bright greenish color and an increase of the PLQY of PNCs from 65% in MMA solution to 74% in the solid film, while the control sample presents a yellow color and a slight drop of the PLQY from 43% to 39%, as shown in Fig. 7a. A thermal shock test was conducted to investigate the thermal stability of the composite films by placing the thin films on a hot plate and increasing the temperature to 100 °C, and then the films were cooled back to room temperature. After five heating/cooling cycles (25 °C/100 °C), the integrated PL intensity of the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO PMMA film remained stable at 74% of its initial value, while the PL intensity of the PNC film dropped to only 33% of its initial value under the same condition, as shown in Fig. 7b and Fig. S10 (ESI†).

(e) Power dependent illuminance of the blue LED chip, the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO film and the CdSe/ZnS film. (f) Photostability of the thin films under 365 nm UV illumination. 
The thermal stability endows the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO film with the capability to fabricate optoelectronic devices. To evaluate the optical performance of the PNCs PMMA composite films in practical LED applications, we integrated the prepared thin films as light down-conversion layers on top of 450 nm blue LEDs. The inset images in Fig. 7d demonstrate the PMMA films made of PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO and CdSe/ZnS NCs under room light and UV illumination, and the combined film as the light down-conversion layer on top of a blue LED panel. The thin films show uniform and bright light. Fig. 7c displays the transient spectra of the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO film and the CdSe/ZnS film on blue LEDs at a driving power in the range from 0.01 W to 0.5 W. Both the PL peak position and the FWHM of the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO present no shift or broadening. Fig. 7d presents the high color gamut of the light down-conversion film, and the color coordinate has only a slight shift with increasing light density, indicating superior color quality and stability of the light down-conversion film. Fig. 7e presents the tendency of the relative illuminance of the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO film, the CdSe/ZnS film and the blue LEDs. The luminescence intensity of the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO film, the CdSe/ZnS film and the blue LEDs show an approximately linear correlation with the operating power till 0.2 W with the same tendency. Afterwards, the luminescence intensities of the green and red films start to decline but maintain a similar trend. We infer that the decline of the PL intensity of the PMMA films employing PNCs and CdSe/ZnS NCs at a high light density is mainly attributed to the increasing thermal quenching induced by the generated heat at a high light power during the light conversion. In addition, the photostability of the prepared PNCs–PMMA composite thin films was studied by continuous illumination of the thin films under highly dense 365 nm UV light in air and the CdSe/ZnS NCs–PMMA film was used as the control sample. As shown in Fig. 7f, the PL intensity of the pristine-PNC based film decreases gradually to <50% of the initial value within 500 min. In comparison, the PL intensity of the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO film displays a slight drop to 93% of the initial value within the first 50 min and then remains constant during the following 500 min. The photostability of the PNCs–ZnMA–TOPO in PMMA is comparable to that of the CdSe/ZnS NCs. This assures that the PNCs–PMMA meets the performance specification required for LED display applications.
Conclusions
In summary, we developed a post-synthetic surface modification strategy to improve the photoluminescence efficiency and stability of perovskite nanocrystals in PMMA polymer matrices. ZnMA and TOPO were employed as surface capping molecules to replace the original ammonia/ammonium ligands on the PNC surface and provide a more hydrophobic and stable surface in the presence of air, polar solvents and heat. Surface analyses revealed that the ZnMA binds to the PNC surface halide, and TOPO further interacts with ZnMA to reinforce the surface passivation and improve the PLQY of the PNCs. In addition, the surface passivation also helps in the homogeneous dispersion of the PNCs in MMA. More importantly, the ZnMA could participate in the polymerization process of MMA and thus establish a robust PMMA encapsulation around the PNCs. The resulting PNCs–PMMA film presents a PLQY of 74% and maintains a constant PL intensity under continuous UV irradiation in air. These characteristics render the PNCs–PMMA film highly stable under practical conditions for their application as light down-conversion layers in LEDs. This method paves a new way for the development of efficient and stable PNCs–polymer composite films without using amine/ammonium ligands. The study on the surface capping motif also helps understand the surface passivation mechanism. We believe that the same strategy can be applied to a broad range of nanomaterials with ionic surfaces to improve their efficiency and stability for LED and other optoelectronic applications.
