    , Accepted 20th May 2021First published on 21st May 2021AbstractWith regard to both the activity and stability of photoelectrode materials, in this study, a hematite cauliflower-like structure with irregularly loaded ZrO2 (ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF) was prepared from as-deposited samples. The effect of post-synthetic treatments such as systematic high-temperature heating at various temperatures (650, 700, 750, and 800 °C) for 10 min, followed by rapid cooling at room temperature (quenching) on interfacial properties and photoelectrochemical performance was investigated in detail. The photoelectrochemical performances of the quenched ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF samples were compared to those of conventionally synthesized hematite nanorod photoanodes quenched from 800 °C (PQ800). Interestingly, ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF photoanodes quenched from 650 °C exhibited 0.62 mA cm−2 photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was 14 times higher than that of the conventionally synthesized hematite quenched from 650 °C (PQ650). Furthermore, ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF photoanodes quenched from 800 °C revealed a photocurrent density of 1.66 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (twice that of PQ800) and improved charge separation efficiencies of ηbulk = 15.6% and ηsurface = 94.6%, respectively. The XPS and HRTEM results also confirmed the irregular ZrO2 loading on the surface of Fe2O3 CF. A possible formation and charge transfer mechanism of ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF was proposed based on a series of temperature-dependent experiments.
1. Introduction
With the increasing global environmental concerns and energy needs involving non-renewable fossil fuel combustion, the production of clean and renewable fuels has become considerably important.1 The generation of renewable and clean fuel from the splitting of water using sunlight is one of the promising approaches.2 Since the first study on PEC splitting of water using TiO2 by Honda and Fujishima,3 the photochemistry of numerous photocatalyst materials (non-TiO2) has attracted attention for energy and environmental applications.4 Among the various metal oxides, hematite (α-Fe2O3) is a very capable photocatalyst for PEC splitting of water because of its non-toxicity, abundance, promising band gap energy (2.0–2.2 eV), and advanced chemical stability.5,6 However, even though the theoretical value of solar-to-hydrogen efficiency for the hematite is ∼15%, it suffers from extremely low hole diffusion length (2–4 nm), less conductivity, truncated light absorption coefficient, and suppressed oxygen evolution kinetics.7,8 Furthermore, extremely poor conductivity is one of the major disadvantages of hematite as a photoanode for practical use. Numerous efforts have been made to address these issues of α-Fe2O3. Notably, elemental doping has been used as a critical method to boost electrical conductivity by enhancing carrier concentrations or carrier mobility.9 Dopants like silicon (Si),10 titanium (Ti),11 tin (Sn),12 zirconium (Zr),13 magnesium (Mg), platinum (Pt), and aluminium (Al)14–16 can show pronounced PEC performance of hematite photoanodes.17 In the hematite photoanode case the elemental doping is classified into two types: (a) in situ and (b) ex situ doping.18In situ doping in materials takes place during its synthesis while accommodation of the external elemental doping in hematite nanostructures via ex situ doping methods starts after the synthesis of parent products, by various techniques such as surface restructuring and high-temperature heat treatments.19
Therefore, when α-Fe2O3 is synthesized from akageneite (β-FeOOH, henceforth denoted as FeOOH) grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), it is mostly heated at 800 °C for 10 min, followed by rapid cooling at room temperature (quenching).7,20,21 The process is known as quenching of Fe2O3 samples. On the other hand, prolonged heating of Fe2O3 at 800 °C severely induced the deformation of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates and led to decreased electrical conductivity and transparency.21 These results indicate that the photoelectrochemical activity of the hematite photoanode is strongly influenced by the heating temperature. Therefore, it is highly necessary to search for a simplistic and effective way to activate the α-Fe2O3 (henceforth denoted as Fe2O3) photoanode at optimum temperature. Previously, Shen et al. reported on the effect of in situ Zr4+ ion doping on the film thickness and photoelectrochemical response of α-Fe2O3 nanorod array photoanodes. They reported that in situ Zr-doped hematite (Zr–Fe2O3) nanorods exhibited a photocurrent density of 0.33 mA cm−2 which was nearly 7.3 times higher than that of the pristine α-Fe2O3 sample (0.045 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl).22 Recently, we have confirmed that a highly photoactive Zr–Fe2O3 photoanode can be formed from ZrO2–FeOOH nanocorals.23 Thus, the amount of doping, morphology, and the photoelectrochemical response of the photocatalyst materials depend strongly on the accuracy of the optimizing parameters; therefore, special attention needs to be paid towards a detailed study on the optimization of post-heating temperatures which can influence the photoelectrochemical properties of the photoanode.
In this study, we have elucidated the effect of systematic high-temperature heating at various temperatures (650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C, and 800 °C) for 10 min followed by quenching on the photoelectrochemical performances of ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF photoanodes. We used a two-step approach to activate the ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF: (a) one-step synthesis of an FeOOH cauliflower-like structure with irregularly (erratically) loaded ZrO2via hydrothermal synthesis and (b) transformation of ZrO2–FeOOH to ZrO2–Fe2O3 through high-temperature heating at various temperatures (650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C, and 800 °C) followed by quenching to room temperature (samples henceforth denoted as ZrQ650, ZrQ700, ZrQ750 and ZrQ800, respectively; Zr-series). We systematically report the effect of quenching from various temperatures (quenching temperatures) and optimization of temperatures on the activation of ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF photoanodes. Furthermore, the effects of various quenching temperatures on the physicochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of the ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF photoanodes were also studied in detail. XPS analysis confirmed that Zr existed in the form of ZrO2 on the as-prepared FeOOH photoanodes; however, it diffused into Fe2O3 CF from the erratically loaded ZrO2 during the high temperature heating. Typically, the ZrQ650 photoanode presented a 0.62 mA cm−2 photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is approximately 14 times greater than that of the Fe2O3 nanorods (Fe2O3 NRs) prepared by the conventional method and quenched from 650 °C (PQ650). Furthermore, ZrQ700 displayed a 1.17 mA cm−2 (at 1.23 V vs. RHE) photocurrent density, which is five times higher than that of the Fe2O3 NRs prepared through the conventional hydrothermal method and quenched from 700 °C. The XPS and HRTEM results, following the Mott–Schottky plots and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy, show that the enhanced performance was ascribed to Zr diffusion arising from the erratic ZrO2 loading, rather than the diffusion of Sn4+ at quenching temperatures. Furthermore, the improved charge-transfer efficiency of ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF compared to that of the conventionally prepared Fe2O3 NRs confirms that the enhanced charge transfer kinetics at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface is due to the erratic ZrO2 loading. A possible growth structure and charge transfer mechanism were proposed for ZrQ750 and Fe2O3 photoanodes prepared via conventional hydrothermal and ethanol based approaches.
2. Experimental
2.1 Development of the hematite nanorod (Fe2O3 NR) photoanodes
The Fe2O3 NRs were developed on FTO glass substrates by a conventional hydrothermal approach described by Vayssieres et al.24 Initially, using a mixed solution of ethanol, acetone, and deionized water (DI), FTO substrates were cleaned by sonication for up to 30 min and subsequently dried under a nitrogen (99.99%) gas flow. One FTO substrate was kept in 10 mL aqueous solution prepared using FeCl3·6H2O (0.4 g) and NaNO3 (0.85 g) at an optimum pH value of 1.5 (adjusted using HCl) in a 20 mL glass vial. Then the vial was kept in an electric oven at 100 °C for 6 h. After the reaction, the as-grown β-FeOOH nanorod (FeOOH NR) electrodes were systematically washed with DI water and immediately dried under a nitrogen gas flow. Furthermore, the as-deposited FeOOH NR electrodes were heated in a box furnace for 10 min at various temperatures (650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C, and 800 °C; heating rate 5 °C min−1). The average times taken to reach the temperatures are 130, 140, 150 and 160 min, respectively. These samples were quenched to room temperature (henceforth denoted as PQ650, PQ700, PQ750, and PQ800, respectively; collectively called P-series samples). Fig. S1† shows a reference experiment for the synthesis of PQ800, which is prepared using the conventional hydrothermal approach.
2.2 Preparation of the ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF photoanodes
The ZrO2–FeOOH CF photoanodes were produced via a hydrothermal method using a diluted initial precursor approach. Typically, FeCl3·6H2O (0.126 g) and NaNO3 (0.85 g) were used as initial precursors and added into 100 mL of deionized water with a pH of 1.5 (adjusted using HCl), denoted as solution A. Then, a 4% zirconium(IV)-ethanolic solution was prepared by adding 4.1336 μL zirconium(IV) oxynitrate hydrate (ZrO(NO3)2) in 10 mL of absolute ethanol and used as the Zr-precursor solution, which is denoted as solution B. Subsequently, 1 mL of the Zr precursor solution (solution B) was added to 10 mL of solution A, as stated earlier for in situ Sn doping.23,25 The rest of the hydrothermal procedure (hydrothermal time, temperature, and washing) followed the process outlined in Section 2.1 for the formation of the hematite nanorod photoanodes. Fig. S2† shows the one-step synthesized FeOOH CF with erratically loaded ZrO2 during the hydrothermal process. The as-prepared ZrO2–FeOOH CF thin films were heated at various temperatures (650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C, and 800 °C; heating rate 5 °C min−1) in a box furnace for 10 min followed by quenching to room temperature, respectively. The schematic for the formation of ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF photoanodes is shown in Fig. 1A. Furthermore, to confirm the impact of erratic ZrO2 loading on FeOOH CF, separate ethanol based FeOOH cauliflower-like structure thin films (Et–FeOOH) were also synthesized by adding 1 mL of pure ethanol without the Zr precursor in the hydrothermal solution. These as-prepared Et–FeOOH thin films were heated at various temperatures of 650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C, and 800 °C, respectively, for 10 min in a furnace (heating rate 5 °C min−1) and quenched to room temperature and denoted as EtQ650, EtQ700, EtQ750, and EtQ800 (collectively called Et-series samples).

2.3 Characterization
For X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, a PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (wavelength Kα1 = 1.540598 Å) in a 2θ angle range from 5 to 80° with a scan rate of 0.03° 2θ s−1 was used for the structural characterization. The morphology of the hematite-based electrodes was studied by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, ZEISS SUPRA 40VP). Furthermore, the structural and detailed morphological analyses of the electrodes were studied through high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) using a JEOL ARM-200F with a 200 kV accelerating voltage. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the elemental composition and perform quantification of the as-prepared photoanodes using a PHI Quantera II spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV, 25 W, and 15 kV). The optical absorption analyses of Zr–Fe2O3 NC were performed using a Shimadzu UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600). The bandgap values of the hematite-based electrodes were calculated using the Tauc plot method:26 (αhν)1/n = A(hν − Eg)(1)where α, A, and ν are the absorption coefficient, proportionality constant, and light frequency. The value of n is dependent on the type of electronic transition (n = 2 and 0.5 for the indirect and direct transitions, respectively); h and Eg are Planck's constant and bandgap energy, respectively. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies were conducted on the 7D beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PLS-II, 3.0 GeV). The fluorescence spectrum for the Fe K-edge (E0 = 7112 eV) was obtained for each of the ethanol-series and Zr-series-based photoanodes. The background of the obtained spectra was removed, and the spectra were normalized and Fourier-transformed using ATHENA. The structural parameters were extracted using a least-square fit using ARTHEMIS in the IFEFFIT suite of programs.27 Steady-state PL spectra were obtained in the spectral range of 470–730 nm under 470 nm laser excitation using a tunable optical filter (KURIOS-VB1, Thorlabs) which was placed in front of the avalanche photodiode detector. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the as-prepared samples was studied on a confocal microscope (MicroTime-200, Picoquant, Germany). The excitation source was an LDH-P-C-470, Picoquant, Germany, a single-mode pulsed diode laser equipped with an 80 MHz repetition rate and an average power of 0.5 mW. A dichroic mirror (490 DCXR, AHF), a single-photon avalanche diode (PDM series, MPD), and 2 long-pass filters (HQ500lp, AHF, and FEL500, Thorlabs) were used to accumulate the emissions from the photoanodes. In order to measure the emitted photons, the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) approach was used. Exponential fitting of the measured photoluminescence (PL) spectra was done using Symphotime-64 software (Ver. 2.2) with the bi-exponential decay model I(t) = ∑Aie−t/τi(2)where the time-dependent photoluminescence intensity is denoted by I(t), and A and τ are the amplitude and the PL lifetime. The value of i is 2.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) analyses were carried out using a specially designed three-armed glass cell with a central quartz circular window as described in our previous work.23 The prepared Fe2O3-based photoanodes, Pt, and Hg/HgO functioned as the working electrodes, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. During the photoelectrochemical analyses, the illuminated 1 cm2 area of the working electrode was kept constant. A 1 M NaOH aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. The photocurrent density vs. applied potential (J–V) and photocurrent density vs. time (J–t) were measured under one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) using an Ivium CompactStat potentiostat. Using the Nernst equation, the measured potential was converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale:28 ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.059pH + E0Hg/HgO(3)(E0Hg/HgO = 0.095 V vs. NHE at 25 °C).
The photocurrent response (chronoamperometry) with chopping during on/off illumination and stability curves were measured under one sun illumination at 1.23 V vs. RHE. During J–t measurements, the transient photocurrent responses for the PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes were measured under light on–off conditions. Initially, the PQ800 sample was measured for 10 s under the light on/off conditions. While in the second time, the ZrQ700 photoanode was measured for 15 s under dark conditions and then irradiated with light after 15 s, and the light irradiation was halted at 25 s. Similarly, the rest of the photoanodes (ZrQ750 and ZrQ800) were also measured by extending the dark time to 35 and 55 s before turning on the light illumination. Finally, for the sake of simplicity and comparison, the measured curves of all four photoanodes were merged in one graph. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in the 3500 kHz to 0.1 Hz frequency range at an applied potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The MS plots were measured under dark conditions with an applied frequency of 100 Hz. A Mott–Schottky plot describes the reciprocal of the square of capacitance (1/C2) versus the applied potential. In the plot of 1/C2vs. V (vs. RHE), the intercept of the straight tangent line with the “X” axis in 1/C2 = 0 gives us the estimated flat band potential values. Furthermore, the donor density (ND) was calculated using the following equation, using the slope of the linear region of the curve:29 ND = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1(4)where e0 is changed on the electron (1.602 × 10−19 C), and ε and ε0 are the dielectric constant (80) of Fe2O3 photoanodes and the permittivity of vacuum (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), respectively. C denotes the capacitance derivative from the EIS analyses.30 Furthermore, IMPS measurements were carried out on a cell prepared for the J–V measurements using a light-emitting diode (LED) with a peak wavelength of 523 nm. During the IMPS measurements, the frequencies were swept from 10 kHz to 0.1 Hz and the intensities of light were modulated at a depth of 10%. The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a CS130 monochromator (Mmac-200, Spectro) at an applied potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE and scan range from 300 nm to 700 nm, respectively. The IPCE was determined using the equation given below:30 IPCE = (1240× Jphoto (mA cm−2))/(Iinc (mW cm−2) × λ (nm))(5)where Jphoto denotes the photocurrent density of the Fe2O3 based photoanodes measured at an applied potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE, Iinc is the power density of the incident monochromatic light, and λ denotes the wavelength.
The value of bulk charge separation efficiencies (ηbulk) was determined using the following equation:31 JH2O = Jabs × ηbulk × ηsurface(6)where JH2O and Jabs are the photocurrent density and photon absorption stated in terms of the current density (absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) = 100%). After adding 0.5 M H2O2 electrolyte, the oxidation kinetics tend to become extremely rapid, and the surface charge recombination is significantly suppressed without affecting the bulk charge separation; thus, surface charge efficiency (ηsurface) could be observed at 100%. The ηbulk and ηsurface can be determined using the equations given below:32 ηbulk = JH2O2/Jabs(7) ηsurface = JH2O/JH2O2(8)where JH2O2 depicts the photocurrent of Fe2O3 based photoanodes measured in the presence of H2O2.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1B displays the XRD patterns of the ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF photoanodes prepared by heating at various temperatures (650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C, and 800 °C, respectively) for 10 min and then quenched to room temperature. It seems that the XRD peaks are assigned to α-Fe2O3 (represented as ‘*’, JCPDS #33-0664) except the diffraction peaks of the FTO substrate (denoted as ‘●’, JCPDS #41-1445). As the heating temperature increased from 650 °C to 800 °C, the XRD peak intensity of hematite increased with a decrease in the full width at half maximum (FWHM), thus increasing the average hematite crystallite size.33,34 Additionally, to check the possibility of transformation of FeOOH into semiconducting α-Fe2O3 at lower heating temperature than 650 °C, the XRD patterns of ZrQ450 and ZrQ550 photoanodes were measured (Fig. S3†). It is observed that even at 450 °C and 550 °C, the FeOOH can be converted to semiconducting α-Fe2O3 (hematite). However, the XRD peak intensity of hematite is lower than 650 °C with a higher full width at half maximum (FWHM). The crystallite sizes of Zr-series samples annealed at different temperatures were calculated using the Scherrer formula35 (eqn (9)) and are shown in Table S1.† Dhkl = 0.9λ/βhklcosθ(9)where Dhkl is the crystallite size in the direction perpendicular to the (hkl) plane, βhkl is the full width at half maximum of the peak from the (hkl) plane and θ is Bragg's diffraction angle. Thus, increasing the annealing temperature led to improved crystallinity of the samples. Some literature studies also suggested that increasing the annealing temperature reduces the possibility of formation of defects, dislocations, interstitial sites, and vacancies, reduces the grain boundaries and increases the atomic mobilities.35–37 The graphical representations of the fundamental crystal structures of α-Fe2O3 with a hexagonal crystal system (space group: Rc, 167) are illustrated using cation polyhedra (Fig. 1C). The XRD peaks corresponding to ZrO2 or impurity peaks such as FeOOH were not observed even in samples quenched from low or high temperatures. The absence of FeOOH diffraction peaks in all samples suggests that low-temperature heating (450 °C) is also sufficient for the conversion of FeOOH to Fe2O3.38,39 Furthermore, for reference, XRD patterns of the β-FeOOH and ZrO2–FeOOH CF samples are shown in Fig. S4.† Meanwhile, the intensities of the (104), (110), and (300) diffraction peaks of ZrQ650, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes were different compared to those of the P-series (PQ650, PQ700, PQ750, and PQ800) and Et-series (EtQ650, EtQ700, EtQ750, and EtQ800) samples shown in Fig. S5A and B,† respectively. Comparing the XRD patterns, it is seen that the (110) and (300) diffraction peaks of the ZrQ650, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 samples are remarkably weaker than those of the PQ650, PQ700, PQ750, and PQ800 samples due to lower concentration of the Fe precursor, while the (104) diffraction peaks of the Zr-series samples are slightly higher than those of the P-series samples. Furthermore, to confirm the Zr diffusion effect on the structural properties of the Fe2O3-based photoanodes, ethanol-containing hematite samples (Et-series) were synthesized following a similar procedure to that used for preparing the Zr-series samples except the addition of the Zr precursor. The Et-series samples exhibited weaker (110) and (300) diffraction peaks in the XRD data, which were distinct from the Zr-series samples. The Et-series samples showed relatively stronger and narrower (104) peaks than those of the Zr-series samples. This result suggests that the preferential orientation growth and crystallinity changed due to the presence of the Zr-precursor in hydrothermal synthesis.
In order to confirm the morphological changes in ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF photoanodes, Zr-series samples were measured using FESEM. Fig. 2 depicts the surface and cross-sectional views of the Zr-series photoanodes. All the Zr-series samples possessed a cauliflower structure-like morphology with a slight change in diameters and decreased lengths compared to the P-series samples. It is clear that as the quenching temperature of the Zr-series samples increased from 650 to 800 °C, the ZrQ650, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 samples exhibited melted cauliflower-like structures. Fig. S6a and d† show that FeOOH films possessed sharp nanorod shapes with an average diameter of 30 nm and length of 566 nm, which is similar to the previously reported values,40 while ZrO2–FeOOH NC films, before the quenching process, exhibited an increase in the diameter of the cauliflower-like structure, as shown in Fig. S6b and e.† Similarly, the Et–FeOOH samples also exhibit the cauliflower-like structure like that of ZrO2–FeOOH films (Fig. S6c and f†). On the other hand, according to previous reports, one-step synthesis via doping or surface loading can change the morphology of hematite from nanorods to cauliflower-like clusters, due to the simultaneous addition of ethanol and the dopant in the hydrothermal precursor solution (Fig. S6c and f†).41 Therefore, to distinguish the effect of quenching temperatures on the Et-series and Zr-series samples, the FESEM analysis was performed for the Et-series photoanodes and the results are shown in Fig. S7† and compared with the results of the Zr-series (Fig. 2) and P-series samples (Fig. S8†). The Et-series samples exhibited a morphology of cauliflower-like clusters with increased grain diameter; however, morphologically, the Et-series samples were similar to the Zr-series samples. The cross-sectional image showed that the length of Et–FeOOH was almost the same as that of ZrO2–FeOOH CF; however, the top-view image of Et–FeOOH showed an increased size of cauliflower-like structures than that of ZrO2–FeOOH CF. In addition, the top-view images of the Zr-series samples (Fig. 2) reveal tiny particles on the top of the cauliflower structures. From this morphological result, we concluded that both the presence of ethanol and Zr-precursor can contribute to changing the nanorod morphology into a cauliflower-like structure morphology. Meanwhile, the samples of all series (P-series, Et-series and Zr-series) showed the same trend of decreasing length and facet melting when the temperature progresses from 650 °C to 800 °C. This phenomenon is caused by melting and agglomeration during the heating process, as reported in a previous study.42,43 The impact of quenching temperature and Zr diffusion on the optical properties of Zr-series samples was studied using UV-Vis absorbance analyses. The UV-Vis absorbance spectra and corresponding bandgap energies of the PQ800 and Zr-series photoanodes are shown in Fig. S9.† The PQ800 and Zr-series samples exhibited steep absorption spectra up to approximately 600 nm. Examination of the UV-vis absorption spectrum of each sample shows that there is no significant difference, as seen in Fig. S9A.† This indicates that Zr diffusion and different quenching temperatures are not crucial factors in determining the light absorption ability of Zr-series photoanodes. Moreover, the bandgap of each sample was calculated from the Tauc plot.44 Fig. S9B† shows that the bandgap energies were almost the same (2.08–2.09 eV) which indicates that there is not much difference in the bandgap energies of the photoanodes after Zr diffusion and quenching from various temperatures.

TEM analyses of ZrO2–FeOOH CF and ZrQ800 were further performed to investigate the morphological changes, crystalline structures and the Zr state of both samples, as shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3A(a) and B(a), low-magnification TEM images of both samples show a cauliflower-like structure, which agrees with the FESEM images. Fig. 3A(b) reveals two kinds of interplanar spacing of 2.60 Å (red color) and 2.55 Å (yellow color), which are in good agreement with the d-values of the (002) ZrO2 plane (JCPDS no. 17-0923) and (100) FeOOH plane (JCPDS no. 75-1594), respectively. Moreover, the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) patterns in Fig. 3A(b) suggest that ZrO2 existed in a semi-crystalline form on the surface of the ZrO2–FeOOH CF films. However, EDS elemental mapping images reveal a continuous ZrO2 dispersion on the surface of the FeOOH CFs in the ZrO2–FeOOH CF sample. Consequently, the FFT pattern can also suggest that well-crystallized ZrO2 clusters are present on the surface of the FeOOH CF structure. Subsequently, the HR-TEM image of the ZrQ800 samples shows an interplanar spacing of 2.52 Å, which corresponds to the (110) plane of Fe2O3 (JCPDS no. 33-0664), as shown in Fig. 3B(b). The inset of Fig. 3B(b) demonstrates the existence of hematite with a (110) growth direction. In comparison with ZrO2–FeOOH CF, the absence of distinct crystallized ZrO2 in the ZrQ800 samples indicates that ZrO2 could have diffused to the hematite lattice during high-temperature heating followed by quenching and thus very little ZrO2 is present on the surface, which is illustrated further through XPS analyses. However, the EDS elemental mapping indicates that Zr, Sn, Fe, and O were non-homogeneously distributed on the ZrQ800 photoanode with Zr enriched near the edge (Fig. 3B(c)). In addition to ZrQ800, a similar effect was observed for the ZrQ750 samples, as shown in Fig. S10a–c.†

An XPS study was carried out to investigate the chemical states of elements in ZrO2–FeOOH CF and Zr-series samples. Fig. S11† shows the XPS peaks of the Fe, O, and Zr elements that can be clearly observed for all ZrO2–FeOOH CF and Zr-series samples. Fig. 4 shows the narrow scan XPS spectra of (A) Fe 2p, (B) O 1s, (C) Zr 3d, and (D) Sn 3d for ZrO2–FeOOH CF, ZrQ650, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes, respectively. Table S2† lists the atomic percentages (at%) of the elemental composition acquired from the XPS study of ZrO2–FeOOH CF and Zr-series photoanodes. As shown in Fig. 4A, the Fe 2p XPS narrow spectra of ZrO2–FeOOH CF, ZrQ650, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes exhibit doublet peaks located at 711.2 eV and 724.3 eV, which resemble the binding energies (BEs) of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively. The existence of the satellite peak near 719.1 eV is attributed to the Fe3+ main species in the ZrO2–FeOOH CF and Zr-series samples. These values are in good agreement with the reported data.44 The O 1s peaks of ZrO2–FeOOH CF are different from those of the Zr-series samples and are centred at 529.7 eV, as shown in Fig. 4B. To separate the broad peaks of O 1s, peak deconvolution was performed for (A) ZrO2–FeOOH CF, (B) ZrQ650, and (C) ZrQ800 photoanodes (Fig. S12†). The major peak positioned at a binding energy of 529.9 eV is ascribed to the O2− forming oxide with Fe (lattice oxygen).45 Two more peaks were located at 531.0 and 531.9 eV which correspond to lattice OH− and adsorbed water, respectively.46,47 Furthermore, the peak intensities of lattice oxygen increase after an increase in temperature from 650 °C to 800 °C, while adsorbed OH− decreased, finally disappearing in the ZrQ800 samples. The increased lattice oxygen peak and decreased adsorbed OH− peak were caused by oxidation and OH− desorption, respectively, during the high-temperature heating followed by quenching. Fig. 4C shows that the Zr 3d XPS narrow scan spectra of ZrO2–FeOOH CF display two peaks located at 182.4 (Zr 3d5/2) and 184.8 eV (Zr 3d3/2), which are associated with Zr in the form of ZrO2.48,49 After the heating and quenching process in ZrQ650, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes, these two peaks shifted to 181.75 and 184.15 eV, which are negatively shifted by 0.65 eV compared with those of ZrO2–FeOOH CF. This slight shift in the Zr 3d peaks suggests the presence of Zr4+ instead of ZrO2 states.23,50 According to previous reports, a slight shift in the Zr 3d binding energies within 1 eV indicates that Zr ions diffuse into the photoanode in the Zr4+ form.51 In addition, when the quenching time increased, the atomic percentages from XPS of Zr-elements gradually decreased from 7.20% for ZrO2–FeOOH CF to 4.88% for ZrQ800, as listed in Table S2.† The decreased Zr element amount on the surface of the samples might have been caused by increased Zr diffusion into ZrQ800 photoanodes during high-temperature heating followed by quenching. This explanation agrees well with the phenomenon of negative shifts in the Zr 3d peaks of the quenched samples. As a result, it is possible to explain that Zr4+ diffused into the Fe2O3 lattice during quenching. The XPS Sn 3d spectrum of the Zr-series samples possesses two weak peaks (Fig. 4D) at 486.35 and 494.75 eV, consistent with Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2, respectively.21,52 In the case of ZrO2–FeOOH CF samples, Sn4+ was not detected using XPS, indicating that diffusion of Sn from the FTO substrate to Fe2O3 CF starts through heating above 650 °C.53 It is seen that with increasing the heating temperature, the Sn atomic percentages of Sn-doped hematite samples increased and are in good agreement with the reported literature.7,40 Thus, when the temperature rose to 800 °C, the atomic percentage of Sn in the ZrQ800 photoanodes should have increased more than that of the ZrQ650 photoanodes. However, the Sn atomic percentages are almost the same in all the Zr-series samples. This is because in the high-temperature heating process the diffused Zr atoms in Fe2O3 can interrupt Sn diffusion from the FTO.54 The local structure of an Fe atom in photoanodes was studied using EXAFS analysis. Of the several peaks appearing in Fig. 5A and B, the peak located at 0.8–2.0 Å is due to Fe–O bonds corresponding to the first shell in the Fe2O3 structure. The minimal change in the spectra demonstrates that quenching temperatures do not pointedly affect the local structure for both Zr-series and Et-series hematite photoanodes. However, the Zr-series samples exhibited a more severe asymmetrical peak shape compared to the Et-series sample. Fig. 5C compares these spectra in a distinct manner. While the Et-series sample has an Fe–O peak at a similar distance to that of the reference Fe2O3 powder, the peak for the Zr-series samples shifted to a shorter distance. When Zr4+ with a larger ionic radius is doped into the Fe3+ site in hematite, the consequent distortion causes a reduced Fe–O bond length. The structural parameters obtained from EXAFS fit in Table S3† confirm this observation by showing that the Fe–O bond distances for Zr-series samples are shorter by 0.06–0.07 Å as compared to those for the Et-series samples and reference hematite.

To evaluate the Zr-diffusion consequence on the PEC performance of Zr-series photoanodes, the photocurrent density–potential (J–V) characteristics of the as-prepared ZrO2–FeOOH CF electrodes and PQ650, EtQ650, ZrQ650, and ex situ Zr–Fe2O3 (Ex-ZrQ650; details of the synthesis process are given in the ESI†) photoanodes were measured and compared. Ex situ Zr-series samples (Ex-ZrQ650, Ex-ZrQ700, Ex-ZrQ750 and Ex-ZrQ80) were prepared similar to EtQ650, except the separate 4% ZrO(NO3)2 ethanolic solution (4.1336 μL ZrO(NO3)2 in 10 mL ethanol) before the quenching process. Fig. 6A shows that all of the as-prepared FeOOH photoanode series (FeOOH NRs (P–FeOOH), Et–FeOOH, ZrO2–FeOOH CF, and Ex-Zr-FeOOH (details are given in the ESI†)) generated a tiny photocurrent of approximately 4 μA cm−2, which is consistent with previous results.37Fig. 6B shows that ZrQ650 exhibits a 0.62 mA cm−2 photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is 14 times higher than that of PQ650. In contrast, the reimaging samples (EtQ650 and Ex-ZrQ650 photoanodes) still revealed a photocurrent density of 0.06 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. To compare the charge-transfer kinetics of ZrQ650 photoanodes, Nyquist diagrams for the PQ650, EtQ650, ZrQ650, and Ex-ZrQ650 photoanodes were also measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE applied potential. Fig. 6C shows that ZrQ650 demonstrated a reduced semicircle diameter than those of EtQ650, Ex-ZrQ650, and PQ650, thus indicating a quicker interfacial charge transfer to the electron collector.55 Therefore, the ZrQ650 cauliflower-like structure can facilitate charge transfer and overwhelm the charge recombination over the other studied photoanodes. Furthermore, to clarify the effects of Zr diffusion on the microelectronic properties of the hematite cauliflower-like structure and, hence, the enhanced PEC performance, the Mott–Schottky (MS) plots were measured for PQ650 and ZrQ650 under dark conditions. Fig. 6D shows the MS plots of the PQ650 and ZrQ650 photoanodes and the slopes of the MS plots were used to estimate the carrier density.56 The estimated values of carrier density of ZrQ650 and PQ650 are 2.81 × 1019 cm−3 and 2.36 × 1019 cm−3, respectively. The higher donor density of PQ650 results from effective substitution of Fe3+ by Sn4+, which has a larger ionic radius. This led to Sn-doping in the optimally thick PQ650 sample. However, the lower MS value of the ZrQ650 sample is due to a trade-off between the Sn dopant and optimum Zr diffusion in the hematite which led to a decrease in the amount of Sn dopant in the hematite during high-temperature quenching. The results are in good agreement with the XPS results.

Furthermore, Fig. 7A illustrates that the PQ800 photoanodes showed photocurrent densities of 0.84 and 1.09 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and 1.4 V vs. RHE, respectively, with 0.7 V vs. RHE onset potential which is similar to that of hematite photoanodes reported in our previous studies.57 The photocurrent performance of the Zr-series samples gradually increased with quenching temperature and was significantly higher than that of the PQ800 photoanodes. More specifically, ZrQ700 and ZrQ750 exhibited photocurrent densities of 1.17 and 1.43 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively. Also, the ZrQ800 sample exhibited a photocurrent density value of 1.66 mA cm−2 (at 1.23 V vs. RHE), which is twice that of PQ800. This value is the highest among the comparative photocurrent density results of hematite photoanodes synthesized using different synthetic approaches (Table S4†). The boosted photocurrent density can be accredited to the improved Zr diffusion into the hematite photoanodes as the quenching temperature increased. However, the anodic shift in the photocurrent density of ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF is due to the effect of one-step synthesis via erratic ZrO2 loading during the hydrothermal process and Zr4+ diffusion into hematite after high-temperature heating. A similar phenomenon was also reported in the literature for Ti doping, diffusion and surface passivation.35,58,59Fig. 7B shows the transient photocurrent responses for the PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes under light on–off conditions. During the on–off cycles, all of the studied samples exhibited an excellent photoresponse as they showed that the current was quickly generated under irradiation, and the photocurrent dropped to zero when irradiation was stopped. The presence of rising spikes in the current transients (light “ON” condition) represents the hole accumulation at the electrode–electrolyte junction deprived of any injections to the electrolyte.60 Moreover, the photocurrent decay (Id) (change between initial current (Ii) and final current (If); Id = Ii − If) of the PQ800 photoanode was 99 μA, while in the case of ZrQ750 and ZrQ800 photoanodes, the photocurrent decay decreased to 72 μA and 46 μA, respectively. The decreased photocurrent decay was caused by lower charge recombination at the ZrQ750 and ZrQ800 photoanode–electrolyte interface.61 The photoelectrochemical stability tests of the PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 electrodes were conducted under constant 1 sun illumination and at 1.23 V vs. RHE applied potential, as shown in Fig. 7C. The stable photocurrent density in the long term (1 h) with no observable decay indicates that the PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes have superior structural, chemical, and photoelectrochemical stability. Fig. 7D displays the plots of the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) for the PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes. ABPE was calculated from J–V measurements using the following equation:41 ABPE (%) = Jph × (1.23 − V)/P × 100(10)where Jph denotes the photocurrent (mA cm−2) measured at applied voltage (V) and P denotes the power density of illuminated light (100 mW cm−2). ZrQ800 achieved the maximum ABPE value of 0.115% at 1.1 V vs. RHE, which is 1.5 times greater than that of PQ800 (0.073%).

Furthermore, to study the charge transport phenomenon of the PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes, EIS analyses were carried out at 1.23 V vs. RHE applied potential with 1 sun illumination (Fig. 8A). Nyquist plots were fitted with an equivalent RC circuit and the fitted EIS parameters are listed in Table 1. The RC circuit is composed of two Randles circuits linked in series with a resistance.62Rs is mainly the FTO sheet resistance, while RCT1 describes the charge transfer resistance and CPE1 is the capacitance at the FTO–hematite interface. Meanwhile, resistance at the hematite–electrolyte interface, and the corresponding double-layer-capacitance are denoted by RCT2 and CPE2, respectively. With increasing quenching temperature of the Zr-series samples, the Rs values were found to have gradually increased from 21 Ω for ZrQ700 to 38 Ω for ZrQ800 (Table 1). The increased values of Rs are associated with the deformation of FTO at high temperatures, leading to decreased conductivity. Furthermore, to check the influence of annealing temperatures on the resistivity of FTO samples, we studied the resistance of FTO after annealing at different temperatures. Fig. S13b† shows that the resistance values for the FTO before heating (13.1 Ω) and after heating (annealing) at 650, 700, 750 and 800 °C are 21.3 Ω, 22.3 Ω and 25.3 Ω and 38 Ω, respectively. The increased resistance of FTO increased with increasing the annealing temperature from 650 °C to 800 °C due to the stoichiometric change that directly affects the electrical conductivity of the FTO substrates during the annealing process.21,63 Furthermore, the Zr-series samples show lower RCT1 values than those of the PQ800 samples. More specifically, the RCT1 values of the PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes are 216, 199, 110, and 78 Ω, respectively. This result indicates that the Zr-series samples possessed lower charge transfer resistance than those of the PQ800 photoanode due to high-temperature Zr diffusion from the surface ZrO2 to the bulk of the hematite. After heating at 700, 750, and 800 °C, the diffused Zr4+ atom acted as an electron donor, which increased the electrical conductivity of the Zr-series samples. Moreover, as the quenching temperature increased in Zr-series samples, RCT2 values significantly decreased from 237 Ω (ZrQ700) to 114 Ω (ZrQ800). This result shows that in addition to the diffusion of Zr4+, the high-temperature quenching still yields a non-uniform ZrO2 passivation layer on the photoanode surface.56

Positive slopes of the Mott–Schottky plot of the PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes indicate that they were n-type semiconductors in nature (Fig. 8B). The estimated donor densities of the PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes were 1.08 × 1020, 1.34 × 1020, 1.95 × 1020, and 2.89 × 1020 cm−3, respectively. Thus, Zr-series samples possess higher donor density than that of the PQ800 sample, suggesting that Zr4+ diffusion can occur during low-temperature quenching. Moreover, the higher donor density value of the ZrQ800 sample indicates that the amount of Zr4+ diffusion increased as the quenching temperature increased. These results provide strong evidence that Zr4+ dopants play the role of electron donors and increase the donor density of the parent photoanode substantially after diffusion. Therefore, these results are in good agreement with the photocurrent density results (J–V curves) of the PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes. In order to further characterize the electron transport time in the PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes, IMPS measurements were performed at an applied potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE under 1 sun illumination conditions. The electron transport time (τd) can be calculated from the following equation:41 Electron transport time (τd) = 1/2πfmin(11)where fmin is the frequency of the minimum point in the IMPS semicircle. Fig. 8C shows that the electron transport times for PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 were 0.475, 0.449, 0.377, and 0.317 ms, respectively (Table S5†). The shorter electron transport time indicates that charge transfer can more easily proceed in Zr-series samples than in PQ800 photoanodes. The significant reduction in the charge transport resistance of the ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 samples was also revealed from the EIS results. Furthermore, the PL spectra were recorded in the visible region under a 470 nm laser excitation. Most emissions were observed at around 590 nm near the band-edge of the photoanode materials. ZrQ700 showed the strongest emissions among the photoanodes (Fig. S14†), which means that emissive recombination is highly probable in ZrQ700 compared to the other anode materials. IPCE was done to determine the quantum efficiencies of the PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes for water splitting.41Fig. 8D shows that the IPCE spectra were measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE within the wavelength range from 300 nm to 700 nm for the PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes. PQ800 photoanodes had an IPCE value of 3.80%, while the Zr-series samples showed a higher IPCE value than that of the PQ800 over the entire response wavelength spectrum. This result suggests the beneficial impacts of erratic ZrO2 loading and Zr4+ diffusion on the PEC performance of Zr-series photoanodes. In particular, the IPCE value significantly increased up to 17.1% for the ZrQ800 photoanode. Therefore, high-temperature heating can result in effective Zr4+ diffusion in addition to the erratic surface passivation in the Fe2O3 CF photoanodes.
To further study the consequence of erratic ZrO2 loading and Zr4+ diffusion in ZrQ800 and compare it to EtQ800 and conventionally prepared PQ800 photoanodes, the photocurrent densities of these photoanodes (PQ800, ZrQ800, and EtQ800) were measured and compared (Fig. S15A†). Among the studied samples, ZrQ800 exhibited the highest photocurrent enhancement compared to EtQ800 and PQ800. This is because, during heating, a portion of the nonuniform ZrO2 layer present on the surface of the electrode was diffused to the bulk of the Fe2O3 CF nanostructures, as confirmed from the TEM and XPS analyses.
In contrast, in EtQ800 and PQ800, despite heating at 800 °C for 10 min, the absence of Zr4+ diffusion and erratic ZrO2 loading on Fe2O3 CF led to a lower photocurrent performance. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, the photocurrent and donor density values of the PQ800 and EtQ800 photoanodes were lower than those of the ZrQ800 photoanodes. To further study and compare the consequence of erratic ZrO2 loading and Zr4+ diffusion on the photogenerated charge transfer kinetics of ZrQ800 with that of the PQ800 and EtQ800 photoanodes, EIS measurements were carried out at 1.23 V vs. RHE and under one sun illumination. The smaller EIS semicircle of ZrQ800, compared to those of PQ800 and EtQ800, corresponds to a reduced electron transport resistance. The EIS results (Fig. S15B†) are in good agreement with the photocurrent measurements. Also, MS of ZrQ800, PQ800, and EtQ800 photoanodes shows improved donor density in ZrQ800 than the other studied samples. The improved donor density is also in good agreement with the J–V and EIS curves of the PQ800, EtQ800, and ZrQ800 photoanodes (Fig. S15C†).
Furthermore, a time-resolved PL decay analysis was carried out for the PQ800, EtQ800, and ZrQ800 photoanodes (Fig. S15D†). Generally, photo-excited exciton (electron–hole pair) recombination dynamics is very useful for determining the photocatalytic efficiency. The slow exciton recombination rate, i.e., elongated lifetime, in photocatalysts provides preferable environments for subsequent photo-electrochemical (PEC) reaction rather than the case of fast exciton recombination. By now, the PL lifetime elongation strategy has been achieved through careful materials design of the semiconductor hetero-junction and atomic level elemental doping based on the concepts of electron–hole separation and charge carrier localization, respectively. The PL lifetime of the PQ800, EtQ800, and ZrQ800 photoanodes was examined and is shown in Table S6.† The PQ800 and EtQ800 samples showed bi-exponential decays with two-lifetime components. We consider that the observed lifetime components are ascribed to band-edge transition associated with the intrinsic trap-states.19,22 The estimated average lifetime is obviously proven to be elongated in the EtQ800 sample (1.39 ns) compared with the PQ800 phase (0.47 ns). In the case of the ZrQ800 sample, it is extremely noteworthy that the third component lifetime of 64 ns newly appeared, which enabled an extraordinary elongated average lifetime of 23 ns. We consider that the longest lifetime component originates from the Zr diffusion in Fe2O3 through the formation of localized extrinsic trap-states.22,64 From the photocatalytic reaction aspect, it is meaningful to mention that excited charge carriers in trap-states with such an elongated lifetime have a linear correlation with photocurrent density and a higher chance of participation in the PEC reaction, therefore enabling higher catalytic efficiency. Usually, the short PL lifetime of hematite is ascribed to the short hole diffusion length resulting from the fast recombination between electrons and holes.65 These changes in decay time are highly consistent with the IMPS and EIS measurement results. Additionally, we measured and studied the photocurrent density–potential curves of Zr-series samples heated at 700 and 750 °C followed by quenching and compared them with the conventionally prepared hematite nanorods and ex situ Zr-series samples. The outcomes are shown in Fig. S16A and B.† It is clear that compared to the conventionally prepared (PQ700 and PQ750), Et-series (EtQ700, EtQ750), and ex situ prepared (Ex-ZrQ700, Ex-ZrQ750) photoanodes, the one-step synthesized Zr-series samples (ZrQ700 and ZrQ750) showed excellent performance. This enhanced photoelectrochemical performance is ascribed to the increased donor density and effective photogenerated charge separation in the Zr-series samples, which is a result of Zr4+ diffusion and erratic ZrO2 surface loading rather than the diffusion of Sn4+ at lower quenching temperatures. Thus, the proposed mechanism of erratic ZrO2 loading and Zr diffusion during the transformation of ZrO2–FeOOH CF to ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF is explained in Fig. S17.† Finally, to estimate the bulk and surface charge separation properties of the photoanodes, the bulk (ηbulk) and surface (ηsurface) charge separation efficiencies of the PQ800 and Zr-series photoanodes were assessed by relating the photocurrent densities in the presence of a hole scavenger (0.5 M H2O2/1 M NaOH) electrolyte solution. Fig. S18† shows the J–V curves under one sun illumination and dark conditions (dashed lines) for PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes with and without 0.5 M H2O2. Furthermore, Fig. 9A shows that the ηbulk value for PQ800 is 5.76% at 1.23 V vs. RHE, while the ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes exhibited ηbulk values of 12.7, 13.3, and 15.6%, respectively. The ηbulk values of the Zr-series samples, which were higher than those of the PQ800 photoanodes, indicate that Zr4+ diffusion can achieve enhanced charge separation in the bulk of the photoanode. This result suggests that Zr4+ diffusion successfully occurred during low-temperature heating, and optimized temperature was necessary for optimum Zr4+ diffusion to advance the PEC activity of Zr-series samples. Thus, Zr4+ diffusion in Zr-series hematite photoanodes can effectively improve the bulk charge separation owing to the enhanced electrical conductivity.66 Additionally, to study the interfacial charge separation properties in detail, ηsurface was calculated as shown in Fig. 9B. The interfacial charge separation efficiency test produced very interesting results. The maximum ηsurface values of the PQ800, ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800 photoanodes were 78.8, 54.4, 79.3, and 94.6%, respectively. The ZrQ700 sample showed an improved ηbulk value over that of PQ800 but exhibited a lower ηsurface value, which is due to surface defects. This led to the ZrQ700 sample showing a slight increase in photocurrent density and photocurrent decay (Id) compared with the PQ800 samples. In addition to ZrQ700, as the temperature increased to 750 and 800 °C, the ηsurface value increased in ZrQ750 and ZrQ800. Moreover, this result agrees well with the EIS results, suggesting that with increasing the temperature, the value of RCT2 decreased for the Zr-series samples. Therefore, due to the enhancement in charge separation efficiency (ηbulk and ηsurface), the ZrQ800 photoanode showed reduced surface recombination and superior PEC performance over those of the PQ800, ZrQ650, ZrQ700 and ZrQ750 photoanodes.

Moreover, to check the stability and the photoelectrode performance of the ZrQ650 and ZrQ800 photoanodes, we further modified the electrodes with cobalt-phosphate (Co-Pi) using the electrodeposition method. Typically, the electrodeposition was conducted in a three-electrode cell with an as-fabricated photoanode (either ZrQ650 or ZrQ800) as the working electrode, and Pt foil and Ag/AgCl as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Co-Pi depositions were carried out at a constant voltage of 1.9 V vs. RHE in an electrolyte solution containing 0.5 mM cobalt nitrate and 0.1 M potassium phosphate. The electrodeposition was performed at current densities of approximately 4–5 μA cm−2 for 10 min.41 After the Co-Pi deposition, the electrodes were rinsed with distilled water and used as photoanodes in our specially designed three-electrode cell for PEC water splitting. The Pt wire and Hg/HgO (1.0 M NaOH) were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively, with 1 M NaOH as an electrolyte. The cell was illuminated with AM 1.5G light (100 mW cm−2) and 1.23 V vs. RHE was used as an external bias during the photoelectrochemical water splitting.23 The evolved gases (O2 on the photoanode and H2 on the Pt counter electrode) were quantified using a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD, Agilent 7820, USA), with a 5 Å molecular sieve column.
The Co-Pi deposited ZrQ650 (ZrQ650/CoPi) photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 1.18 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, as shown in Fig. 10. After 10 h of illumination, ZrQ650/CoPi achieved 157 and 80 μmol of H2 and O2 gases, respectively, with 83% photocurrent stability. Furthermore, the optimum Co-Pi deposited ZrQ800 (ZrQ800/CoPi) photoelectrode attained 310 and 140 μmol of H2 and O2 gases, respectively, after 10 h of continuous irradiation. As shown in Fig. S19,† both samples exhibit more than 80% faradaic efficiency for H2 and O2 gases. Nevertheless, after 10 h of illumination, the ZrQ800/CoPi photoanode retained 98% of the initial photocurrent, suggesting exceptional stability of the photoanode, which indicates that high-temperature heating followed by quenching develops the durable photoelectrode for PEC water splitting. Based on the results shown above, the effect of erratic ZrO2 loading and Zr4+ diffusion in Fe2O3 CF can be systematically demonstrated by comparing the hematite-based photoanodes (Et-series and Zr-series photoanodes) synthesized under the same hydrothermal conditions and heat treatments.

A possible mechanism that clarifies the consequence of Zr4+ diffusion on the ZrQ750 photoanode, comparing it to PQ750 and EtQ750, is illustrated in Scheme 1. As shown in the XPS analysis data in Table S2,† the atomic percentage of Sn atoms spotted on the surface of the Zr-series sample is very low at 0.15%, suggesting that the diffusion of Sn4+ from FTO substrates did not occur effectively. Large amounts of defects in the bulk and surface of EtQ750 act as the recombination centres and reduce the charge separation in the photoanodes (Scheme 1(a)). Nevertheless, the photocurrent density of ZrQ750, which is higher than that of PQ750 and EtQ750, was probably due to the thinner film thickness and the effects of optimizing Zr4+ diffusion. Nonetheless, compared with the ZrQ750 sample, the PQ750 samples exhibited higher charge recombination of photogenerated electrons causing a poorer PEC performance/decreased photocurrent density. This result can be confirmed through the EIS fitting data in Fig. 8A and Table 1. Also, compared to PQ750, the RCT1 and RCT2 values of EtQ750 rapidly increased due to the increase in the grain boundary resistance and the presence of surface defects on the photoanode (Table S7 and Fig. S20†). Furthermore, the conductivity of the ZrQ700 photoanode was lower than that of PQ750 owing to the morphological changes, grain boundary formation, and inhibition of dynamic Sn4+ diffusion into the hematite nanostructures. Meanwhile, ZrQ750 samples showed the lowest values of RCT1 and RCT2 among samples quenched from the same temperature, even though their film thickness was thinner than that of PQ750 and their morphology changed from nanorods to a cauliflower-like structure, similar to EtQ750 (Scheme 1b and c). These results indicate that erratic ZrO2 loading on FeOOH CF during one-step hydrothermal synthesis could induce nonuniform ZrO2 passivation on the surface of the hematite nanostructures after the post-heating temperatures in the Zr-series samples. This passivation and diffused Zr4+ effected a reduction in the surface trap sites and improved the charge-separation process after high-temperature heating (Scheme 1c). Thus, Zr4+ diffusion in the Zr-series samples positively affected the PEC activity of the parent hematite cauliflower-like nanostructure, in conjunction with surface passivation and morphology. In addition, MS analysis results suggest that Zr4+ diffusion led to an increase in donor density in ZrQ750, unlike in EtQ750 and PQ750, leading to the improvement of electron transport and, therefore, refining the PEC performance by hindering the charge recombination in the bulk and surface of the Zr-series samples (ZrQ700, ZrQ750, and ZrQ800). Thus, our results indicate that one-step synthesis leading to erratic ZrO2 loading during the diluted precursor hydrothermal process and Zr4+ diffusion during high temperature heating can efficiently overcome the drawbacks caused by bulk and surface defects and promote the PEC properties of the ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF photoanode, indicating the presence of synergistic effects between the morphology, Zr diffusion, and passivation.

4. Conclusions
We carried out a detailed study on erratic ZrO2 loading on FeOOH CF via a one-step hydrothermal synthesis approach followed by post-heating treatment and quenching to suppress bulk and surface recombination in the photoanode. As a result, the obtained ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF photoanodes showed controlled morphological transformations and higher photocurrents than those of the conventionally prepared Fe2O3 nanorods with parallel orientation. Furthermore, by carefully relating the structural properties and PEC performances of Zr-series photoanodes and conventionally prepared Fe2O3 nanorod photoanodes, the trade-off between the Zr4+ diffusion effect and morphological transformation upon the heating process is discussed. Remarkably, ZrQ700 possessed a photocurrent density of 1.17 mA cm−2, which is almost 5 times higher than that of the PQ700. Also, ZrQ800 exhibited a 2-fold enhancement in photocurrent density compared to PQ750, which was approximately 0.84 mA cm−2 higher than that of PQ800. The Zr-precursor added in the one-step hydrothermal method facilitated erratic ZrO2 loading and post-heating, leading to easy diffusion of Zr4+ in Fe2O3 as compared to the use of conventional Fe2O3 nanorods and Sn diffusion from the FTO substrate after quenching. Furthermore, the ZrQ800 photoelectrode exhibited enhanced surface charge separation (94.6%) efficiency compared to the conventionally prepared Fe2O3 nanorods (78.8%), owing to the reduced charge transfer resistance and improved charge carrier density. This study underlines the importance of hydrothermal formation of ZrO2–FeOOH CF and the effect of post-activation treatments on the photoelectrochemical activity of ZrO2–Fe2O3 CF for the water splitting application.
