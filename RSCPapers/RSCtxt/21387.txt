    , Accepted 16th July 2016First published on 18th July 2016AbstractHot carriers, generated via the non-radiative decay of localized surface plasmon, can be utilized in photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices. In recent years, most studies have focused on conventional plasmon materials like Au and Ag. However, they suffer from several drawbacks like low energy of the generated hot carriers and a high charge-carrier recombination rate. To resolve these problems, here, we propose the plasmon resonances in heavily self-doped titanium oxide (TiO1.67) to realize effective hot carrier generation. Since the plasmon resonant energy of TiO1.67 nanoparticles (2.56 eV) is larger than the bandgap (2.15 eV), plasmon resonances through interband transition can realize both the generation and separation of hot carriers and bring a new strategy for visible-light photodegradation. The photodegradation rate for methyl orange was about 0.034 min−1. More importantly, the combination of plasmonic and catalytic properties makes it feasible to investigate the degradation process of different materials and different structures at the single particle level in situ. By detecting the scattering shift, we demonstrated that the TiO1.67 dimer (Δλ/ΔλRIU = 0.16) possesses a higher photodegradation rate than an individual nanoparticle (Δλ/ΔλRIU = 0.09). We hope this finding may be a beginning, paving the way toward the development of semiconductor plasmonic materials for new applications beyond noble metals.
1. Introduction
Plasmon induced hot carriers are of particular importance to realize solar energy conversion,1,2 photodetection3,4 and photocatalysis.5,6 Recently, most applications involving hot carriers are based on noble metal materials like Au and Ag whose plasmon resonances are dominated by intraband transitions in the visible range.7,8 However, they suffer from three drawbacks, that is the low productivity of hot carriers,9,10 the low energy of hot carriers9 and the high charge-carrier recombination rate.5,11 Therefore, functional light harvesting devices with new structures and new materials are badly needed to achieve high yields of hot carriers.
Different kinds of plasmonic materials have been studied these years. Based on former work,9,10 plasmon resonances dominated by interband transitions would generate much more electron–hole pairs than intraband plasmon resonances. What is more, this interband plasmon resonance crossing a band gap makes the generated hot carriers possess enough energy and lifetime to realize some new applications which cannot be realized in Au or Ag.
Here, we demonstrate that heavily doped titanium oxide (TiO2−x) as a typical example of semiconductor plasmonic materials can achieve plasmon resonances dominated by interband transitions, consequently, realizing the generation and separation of abundant hot carriers at the same time. Noble metals were only used to achieve the generation of hot carriers and could realize photodegradation unless combined with semiconductor materials.6,12–14 In experiment, the interband plasmon resonance with suitable band structures in TiO2−x can generate and inject hot carriers into dye molecules to realize visible-light photodegradation, and the photodegradation rate for methyl orange was about 0.034 min−1. TiO2 as a type of wide bandgap semiconductor only absorbs ultraviolet light, which limits its practical applications. Many strategies have been proposed to improve its photocatalytic performance.15–17 The plasmon resonances in doped semiconductor materials may bring a new mechanism for designing visible-light photocatalysts and give a new perspective to explain the photocatalytic properties of “black titania”.18,19
The high sensitivity of the plasmon resonant wavelength to the surrounding refractive index provides a new method to investigate the photocatalytic performance. Through recording the scattering peak shift of TiO2−x nanoparticles immersed in methyl orange (MO) solution, we were able to detect the catalytic process and catalytic rate of single particles directly in situ. This characterization at the single-particle level by dark-field microscopy (DFM) has been widely used in biosensing20,21 and chemical detection.22–25 As an effective method, the plasmonic monitoring of single-particle catalysis is also important, because it gives us an opportunity to compare the catalytic performances of different nanostructures and different materials rapidly before the characterization in macroscopic quantities. As an example, we demonstrated that the TiO2−x nanoparticle dimer performs better (Δλ/ΔλRIU = 0.16) than individual particles (Δλ/ΔλRIU = 0.09) in visible-light photodegradation because of the “hot-spot” generated in the dimer structure.5,26
2. Experimental
Preparation of TiO1.67 nanoparticles
Heavily doped titanium oxide (TiO1.67) nanoparticles with the sizes from 40 nm to 340 nm were fabricated by femtosecond laser ablation on a titanium target in deionized water by using a Legend Elite Series ultrafast laser (Coherent Inc.) with a pulse duration of 35 fs and a single-pulse energy of 4 mJ.
Macroscopic photocatalysis characterization
The photocatalytic performance of TiO1.67 nanoparticles was measured through the degradation of methyl orange under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter at room temperature. The pre-synthesized sample (20 mg) was added to 25 mL MO solution (10 mg L−1) in a test tube. The mixture was stirred in the dark for 30 min to establish an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The photodegradation experiment was conducted in a photochemical reaction instrument (Qiqian-III, Qiqian Company, China). 3.0 mL of the solution was extracted at given time intervals (15 min), and then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min to remove the photocatalyst. The absorbance of MO solutions was measured by using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Lamda900, PerkinElmer Company).
Microscopic photocatalysis characterization by dark-field scattering measurement
First, we transferred one drop of TiO1.67 colloid to a piece of ITO glass. During the evaporation process, big droplets would split to small droplets that contain less TiO1.67 nanoparticles. When the droplets dried up, two TiO1.67 spheres had a certain degree of probability to self-assemble as a dimer via capillary forces. Then, the scattering spectra of the TiO1.67 monomer or dimer in air, water and MO solution were collected using a dark-field optical microscope (Olympus BX51) integrated with a quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp (100 W), a monochromator (Acton SpectraPro, 2300i), and a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Princeton Instruments, Pixis 400BR_eXcelon). The oblique incident white light was illuminated at 53° incident angle on the specific nanostructures by a dark-field objective on top (LMPLFLN100XBD, numerical aperture = 0.80), and the scattered light was collected by the same objective. Immersing samples under different ambient conditions were realized by dropping small droplets on the ITO substrate, and then by putting a thin cover glass on top. To realize the microscopic photocatalysis characterization, the scattering spectra were collected every 5 min as soon as the light was switched on.
Numerical calculations
The near field distributions were calculated by using the finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD Solutions 8.6.0, Lumerical Solutions, Inc.). The TiO1.67 nanostructures were illuminated with the p-polarized plane-wave normal incident visible light (300–900 nm). Linear polarization incidence simplifies the analysis on near field distributions and is well matched with the unpolarized incident light in experiment. A mesh size of 2 nm for the illuminated region was utilized. The dielectric function of TiO1.67 was obtained from the Drude model after considering the carrier density and bulk plasma frequency.
3. Results and discussion
Doped semiconductor materials are able to produce plasmon resonance when reaching an adequate doping concentration.27–29 Laser ablation in liquids (LAL) is regarded as an effective and simple method for one-step synthesis of self-doped metal oxide nanoparticles.30 The doping level can be adjusted by changing the pulse duration and the power of the laser.31,32 So, here, we used femtosecond LAL to obtain the maximum doping concentration to realize localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in the visible range. Detailed X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman scattering spectra (see Fig. S1, ESI†) have demonstrated the existence of abundant oxygen vacancies, and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data (Fig. S1, ESI†) indicate that the ratio between Ti4+ and Ti3+ is 1:2 which means that the self-doped titanium oxide can be described as TiO1.67. Considering that one oxygen vacancy in the lattice structure of TiO2 would produce two electrons as shown in Fig. 1a, the as-synthesized TiO1.67 nanoparticles with abundant oxygen vacancies possess a carrier density of up to 2.44 × 1022 cm−3 and a plasmon resonant energy of about 2.56 eV.33 The scattering spectrum of single TiO1.67 nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 1b verifies that the LSPRs of TiO1.67 are located in the visible range. The fabricated TiO1.67 nanoparticles have a wide size distribution from 100 nm to 300 nm (see the inset in Fig. 1b). They show plasmon resonant peaks around λ = 500 nm, and the resonant peaks exhibit a red-shift from 450 nm to 500 nm when increasing the size of the nanoparticles.

High carrier density can produce an oscillating electron cloud. (b) Scattering spectra from single TiO1.67 nanospheres with the diameters of 135 nm, 165 nm and 190 nm. The inset is the SEM image showing TiO1.67 nanospheres with different sizes. (c) The schematic that describes the band structures of TiO1.67 and Au. Purple lines represent the CB, green line represents the VB and yellow line represents the d band of Au. Black dashed lines indicate the location of the Fermi level. Under plasmonic excitation, white dots and black dots indicate the injection directions of hot electrons and hot holes in these two materials. (d) Schematic diagrams show the ratio between the interband transition and intraband transition in these two materials. 
The increase of carrier density can also narrow the band gap and enhance the absorption in the visible range. In our previous work,34 we have demonstrated that the bandgap and the valence band position of TiO1.67 are 2.15 eV and 1.72 eV (vs. NHE), respectively. The typical Tauc plot derived from the UV-vis absorption spectrum was used to determine the bandgap (see Fig. S2, ESI†). Although the band gap is much narrower than undoped TiO2 (3.2 eV),31 the CB is more negative than the reduction potential of H2O/H2 and its VB is more positive than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O. So the as-synthesized TiO1.67 nanoparticles are ideal materials to realize photodegradation and photocatalytic water splitting. More importantly, the narrowing of the bandgap makes the hot electrons generated by LSPR span over the bandgap (hν ≥ Eg), and thus generate abundant hot electrons in the CB and abundant hot holes in the VB (see Fig. 1c). Several studies have reported the plasmon resonances of TiO2−x in the near-infrared region. In those situations, free carriers were produced from two pathways: plasmon absorption and non-plasmonic band absorption.33,35 When increasing the doping density (just like TiO1.67 in our case), the plasmon resonant energy increases and exceeds the bandgap, and then the interband plasmon resonance occurs. In this situation, the plasmon absorption coexists with the usual band absorption. The plasmon effect just enhances the generation of hot electrons in the conduction band compared with the conventional photon-generation process. For conventional plasmonic materials like Ag nanoparticles, this kind of interband plasmon resonance has also been seen if the excitation energy is large enough.36
Although the plasmon and band absorption effects cannot be distinguished in the absorption spectrum, they can be clarified in the scattering spectra of TiO1.67 nanoparticles with varied sizes (see Fig. S3†). The plasmon resonances enhance the scattering intensity while the band absorption quenches the scattering at λplasmon < λ < λbandgap, so scattering dips can be observed in this region. At λ < λplasmon, the plasmon effect is dominated, so clearly plasmon scattering peaks can be seen in this region.
These plasmon resonances dominated by interband transitions are different from the plasmon resonance in noble metals like Au. The band structure of Au contains a conduction band and a d band below the conduction band as shown in Fig. 1c. The main LSPR mechanism in Au nanoparticles is the intraband transition within the conduction band, because the gap between the d band and the conduction band is larger than plasmon resonant energy (hν ≤ Eg)7,8 and much more free electrons are located in the conduction band which have no chance to undergo interband transition. The schematic in Fig. 1d may help one understand the ratio of the intraband transition and the interband transition in these two materials intuitively. For TiO1.67, the intraband transition is very weak as the CB contains much less electrons than Au, while the interband transition in TiO1.67 is much more obvious than Au and appears at lower energy, because the bandgap of TiO1.67 is lower than Au.
As mentioned above, intraband plasmon resonances are more likely to decay radiatively, while interband plasmon resonances are more likely to decay non-radiatively through the generation of hot carriers.9,10 When dye molecules adsorb on the surface of TiO1.67 nanoparticles, the abundant hot carriers can be utilized to realize photodegradation under visible light effectively. Titanium oxide with oxygen vacancies can also be regarded as “black titania” in photocatalysis, and the photocatalytic activities of “black titania” like Ti5O9 and Ti9O17 NPs fabricated by LAL have been reported in our former work.31,32 From the measured valence and conduction band positions, we expected that TiO1.67 NPs as a kind of “black titania” can also realize photodegradation. To further confirm the photocatalytic activity, the photocatalytic performances of the as-synthesized TiO1.67 were measured toward the degradation of MO under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter. 20 mg sample was added to 25 mL MO solution (10 mg L−1), and the mixture was stirred in the dark for 30 min before the lamp was switched on. As shown in Fig. 2a, the absorbance of MO decreases rapidly as time prolongs. The relative concentration variation plots are recorded in Fig. 2b. About 85% of MO is removed after 1 hour of photocatalysis. The plot of −ln(C/C0) as a function of irradiation time shown in Fig. 2c indicates that the photodegradation behavior of TiO1.67 obeys first-order kinetics. The degradation rate deduced from the fitting line is 0.034 min−1.

The plasmon resonances in Au or Ag can be damped non-radiatively through the generation of hot electron–hole pairs via Landau damping.2 Since the transitions of electrons from occupied to unoccupied states mainly occurred in the conduction band, the generated hot electron–hole pairs in Au recombine much easier than the carriers in semiconductor materials. Therefore, conventional plasmonic materials can only realize the generation of hot carriers, so they must combine with semiconductor materials and inject the generated hot carriers into semiconductor materials to realize photodegradation or water splitting.12–14 But for TiO1.67, just like combining the properties of semiconductor and plasmonic materials together, the interband transition is able to realize both the generation and separation of hot carriers. Usually, the introduction of dopants involving adding metal or nonmetal impurities in TiO2 would act as charge carrier recombination centers, which is a major issue affecting the photocatalytic efficiency. Fortunately, it has been demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy defects in TiO2−x play an important role in the absorption of O2 molecules, which act as electron scavengers. The Ti3+ species from the removal of oxygen atoms would act as hole scavengers. These two factors lead to the suppression of the charge recombination process.37,38
Besides the conventional macroscopic characterization of photodegradation, the plasmonic properties of TiO1.67 make it different from other photocatalysts and make it possible to realize microscopic characterization of photocatalysis. Matching the dark-field scattering image and the SEM image as shown in Fig. 3a and b helps us measure the scattering spectra of the monomer and dimer in air and in liquid. As we know, the plasmon resonant peaks are sensitive to the surrounding refractive index. When increasing the surrounding refractive index, the resonant peaks will experience a red-shift. To demonstrate this property of TiO1.67 nanoparticles, first, the scattering spectra of the TiO1.67 monomer and dimer in air (n = 1) were recorded as shown in Fig. 3c and d (black curves). The resonant peaks around 500 nm are in intrinsic plasmon mode which is stable and insensitive to the change of the ambient refractive index, because it is related to interband transitions. But the hybrid plasmon modes located above 600 nm are sensitive to the change of the refractive index, because these hybrid modes are produced from the interaction between the dipole modes of different spheres in the dimer or between the dipole mode and its image dipole in the monomer.39 Then, we immersed the sample in water (n = 1.33) and recorded the scattering spectra of the TiO1.67 monomer and dimer respectively (blue curves in Fig. 3c and d). Compared with the scattering spectra in air, the hybrid resonant peaks in water exhibit obvious red-shifts (Δλ = 87 nm for the monomer and Δλ = 101 nm for the dimer). The plasmonic sensitivity per refractive index unit (nm per RIU) is 264 nm per RIU for single particles and 306 nm per RIU for the dimer. This parameter is important to assess the refractive index sensitivity of different nanostructures and, more importantly, assess the photodegradation ability of different nanostructures. In Fig. 3a, we can see two scattering peaks of single particles in water at around 440 nm and 460 nm, which is a little bit different from the peak of single particles in air. It should be noted that the scattering peak at 440 nm is not a characteristic peak but an undesired signal arising from data processing. The scattering peaks above λ = 600 nm are what we focus on. In the experiment, the final scattering spectra are obtained from the recorded spectra divided by the light source spectrum (see Fig. S4, ESI†). Since the light intensity approaches zero at λ = 400 nm, the division process magnifies the fluctuation around λ = 440 nm. A small deviation may arise from considerable differences during the division process. Not only in our work but also in other groups’ work can we observe these small peaks or small platforms below λ = 500 nm.40,41

(c) The scattering spectra of a single TiO1.67 nanoparticle with a diameter of 245 nm in air (n = 1, black curve) and in water (n = 1.33, blue curve). (d) The scattering spectra of a TiO1.67 dimer with the diameters of 205 nm and 170 nm in air (n = 1, black curve) and in water (n = 1.33, blue curve). 
The schematic diagram in Fig. 4a shows the mechanism on how to realize the characterization of photodegradation at the single particle level in situ. When immersing the TiO1.67 nanoparticles loaded on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass in MO solution, dye molecules (n = 1.61) can adsorb on the surface of nanoparticles. After the irradiation from a tungsten halogen lamp (100 W) focused by a dark-field objective (100×, numerical aperture 0.80), the photodegradation effect begins to appear whose reaction rate is much faster than the adsorptive rate. Therefore, the adsorbed MO molecules will transform to CO2 and other ions via a series of reactions which can reduce the ambient refractive index of individual nanostructures. One important application of this microscopic characterization is to investigate the photocatalytic activities of different nanostructures, and this method will greatly simplify the exploration which needed a time-consuming and energy-consuming sample preparation process in the past. So here, for a typical example, we demonstrate that the dimer of TiO1.67 nanoparticles possesses better catalytic activity than single nanoparticles. To investigate the differences between the dimer and monomer for photodegradation, the FDTD method was used to obtain the electric field distributions at plasmon resonant wavelengths. From Fig. 4b and c, one can conclude that the near field property of TiO1.67 nanoparticles is similar to noble metals. For single nanoparticles, the electric field enhancement distributes mainly on the two sides of the nanosphere. But when forming the dimer structure, strong electric enhancement can be observed in the gap between two near-touching spheres which is one order of magnitude higher than the enhancement for single nanoparticles. As the rate of electron–hole formation is proportional to the local intensity of the electric field (|E|2),5 the TiO1.67 dimer with much stronger field enhancement may realize much faster photodegradation than single nanoparticles.

The yellow and white backgrounds indicate light on or off. 
Through the scattering spectrum detection of individual nanostructures in situ, the difference between the TiO1.67 dimer and monomer in photocatalysis can be demonstrated easily. As shown in Fig. 4d, the photodegradation process of an individual TiO1.67 nanoparticle with a size of 270 nm was studied through dark-field scattering. First, the sample was immersed in MO solution for 30 min in the dark. Then, the tungsten halogen lamp was turned on and the collection of the scattering spectrum was completed quickly. After this, the scattering spectra were recorded every 5 min. Until 20 min, the hybrid resonant peaks have experienced blue-shifts from 657 nm to 633 nm. The light was again turned off and we waited for 5 min. Then the light was again turned on and the scattering spectrum was collected quickly, and interestingly, one can see the scattering peak red-shift back, which means that the MO molecules adsorb on TiO1.67 nanoparticles again in the dark. Similarly, we investigated the photodegradation process of the TiO1.67 dimer as shown in Fig. 4e. The resonant wavelength shift in the TiO1.67 dimer is faster and more obvious than in single particles. In 20 minutes, the plasmon resonant peak shifts from 843 nm to 794 nm. What is more, the resonant peak experiences a much larger shift (Δλ = −36 nm) than in single particles (Δλ = −8 nm) only in 5 min, which means the degradation rate in dimer structures is faster than the monomer. Recycling spectral measurements were carried out three times to verify the stability of this microscopic characterization. The plots of the wavelength shift Δλ versus time in Fig. 4f describe the photodegradation rates of the dimer and monomer in detail, and the detection performance during three cycles does not display a significant fluctuation. More precisely, using Δλ divided by plasmonic sensitivity per refractive index unit (λ = 440 nm), one can obtain a quality factor that evaluates the photodegradation rates of different materials and different nanostructures. For TiO1.67 nanoparticles, we demonstrated that dimer structures (Δλ/ΔλRIU = 0.16) possess a higher photodegradation rate than individual particles (Δλ/ΔλRIU = 0.09). This method can be popularized to the photocatalytic studies of arbitrary heavily doped semiconductor materials. This simple dark-field scattering characterization makes it possible to determine the photocatalytic behaviors of individual nanostructures and unnecessary to fabricate large amounts of samples to conduct macroscopic measurement.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrate heavily doped titanium oxide (TiO1.67) as a new plasmonic material to realize LSPR in the visible range. Compared with the intraband transition in Au or Ag, the interband plasmon resonance in TiO1.67 is more appropriate to generate large amounts of hot carriers with high energies and realize the separation of hot electrons and hot holes. These unique features make this kind of plasmonic material useful in photocatalysis. The sensing properties of plasmonic materials give us a new way to study the photodegradation or water splitting processes at the single nanostructure level in situ. We believe that semiconductor plasmonic materials like TiO1.67 combining the plasmonic property and semiconductor property together would exhibit much better performances in photocatalysis, chemical sensing, photodetection and PL manipulation in the future.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Optical properties of TiO1.67 and Au. (a)The schematic shows that one unit cell in TiO2 has half probability to lose one oxygen atom and forms as TiO1.67 (Ti4+:Ti3+ = 1:1). High carrier density can produce an oscillating electron cloud. (b) Scattering spectra from single TiO1.67 nanospheres with the diameters of 135 nm, 165 nm and 190 nm. The inset is the SEM image showing TiO1.67 nanospheres with different sizes. (c) The schematic that describes the band structures of TiO1.67 and Au. Purple lines represent the CB, green line represents the VB and yellow line represents the d band of Au. Black dashed lines indicate the location of the Fermi level. Under plasmonic excitation, white dots and black dots indicate the injection directions of hot electrons and hot holes in these two materials. (d) Schematic diagrams show the ratio between the interband transition and intraband transition in these two materials.	 

 	Fig. 2  Macroscopic photodegradation characterization. (a) UV-vis spectral changes of MO solution. (b) The relative concentration variation plots of MO solution. (c) The plot of −ln(C/C0) vs. time in the presence of TiO1.67 nanoparticles in MO solution.	 

 	Fig. 3  Dark-field scattering spectra at the single-particle level. (a) Dark-field scattering image under 1000 times magnification. (b) The corresponding SEM image. (c) The scattering spectra of a single TiO1.67 nanoparticle with a diameter of 245 nm in air (n = 1, black curve) and in water (n = 1.33, blue curve). (d) The scattering spectra of a TiO1.67 dimer with the diameters of 205 nm and 170 nm in air (n = 1, black curve) and in water (n = 1.33, blue curve).	 

 	Fig. 4  Microscopic photodegradation characterization via dark-field scattering. (a) Schematic shows that the adsorbed MO molecules decrease dramatically after turning on the focused white light. (b), (c) Electric field distributions of the TiO1.67 monomer and dimer calculated by the FDTD method. (d), (e) The scattering spectra of the TiO1.67 monomer and dimer revealing the photodegradation process. Insets are the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the monomer and dimer. The scale bar is 100 nm. (f) The variation of the peak position shift versus time for the monomer (red curve) and dimer (black curve) during three cycles. The yellow and white backgrounds indicate light on or off.
