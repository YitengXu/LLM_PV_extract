    , Accepted 1st December 2017First published on 4th December 2017AbstractTwo novel acceptor–acceptor (A–A) type polymer electron acceptors, PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT, which contain perylene diimide (PDI) and fused PDI (FPDI) with electron deficient 4,7-dithienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) units, respectively, are designed and synthesized to investigate their application in all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). With a narrow band-gap polymer, PTB7-Th, as the polymer donor, all-PSCs based on PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT showed a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.07%, whereas the photovoltaic performance of PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT was further improved with a PCE of 6.23%, which is the best device performance (ca. 75% higher) for all-PSCs of PDI-based A–A type polymer acceptors reported so far. Their optical, electrochemical, photoluminescence and charge transport properties were investigated to illustrate the difference in the photovoltaic performance. The results open a design strategy of PDI-based A–A type polymer electron acceptors through modifying the polymer structure to restrict molecular chain interactions to achieve high performance all-PSCs.
Introduction
In recent years, polymer solar cells (PSCs) as one of the next generation photovoltaic technologies have received considerable attention because of their advantages of low cost, light weight, flexibility, etc.1–4 The most efficient PSCs are mainly based on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) concept, in which the active layer is solution-processed from a blend of a donor and an acceptor. Previously, the acceptor in the BHJ blend layer was predominantly fullerene derivatives, such as PC71BM, and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) beyond 10% in such PSCs have been achieved with rapid developments of conjugated polymer donors.5–9 However, the intrinsic drawbacks, such as high cost, limited light absorption in the visible region and morphological instability, of fullerene electron acceptors have limited further advance in photovoltaic performance and also application in large scale and stable PSCs.10–12 Polymer electron acceptors as the non-fullerene alternative with the unique advantages of tunable energy levels, thermal and morphological stability, etc. have been rapid developed until recently.13–22 However, the current state-of-the-art device performance of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs),21,23 which is based on the BHJ layer of a polymer donor and a polymer electron acceptor, is still lagging behind that of the above fullerene-based PSCs, even though various polymer acceptors based on benzothiadiazole (BT), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), thienopyrroledione (TPD), naphthalene diimide (NDI), B–N bridged bipyridine units and IDIC-type polymer (PZ1) have been developed.22–29 Therefore, the design and preparation of new polymer electron acceptors is urgently needed to further improve the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs.
Perylene diimide (PDI)-based polymer electron acceptors have been considered to be among the most promising electron acceptors because of their remarkable chemical and physical properties of high absorption in the visible region, good electron mobilities and ease of chemical modifications.13,14 The facile design guideline is similar to the one for the construction of polymer donors, which normally involves combining an electron-rich donor (D) and an electron-deficient acceptor (A) alternatively to form the so-called donor–acceptor (D–A) polymer. With this strategy, researchers have developed a lot of D–A type PDI polymer acceptors by adopting various donors, such as thiophene, bithiophene, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, selenophene, benzo[1,2-c;3,4-c′]dithiophene and indacenodithiophene.30–34 The device performances that were achieved with these D–A type PDI polymer acceptors and suitable polymer donors were up to 1–6%. Besides D–A type PDI polymers, another combination of PDI polymer acceptors is to have the molecular architecture of two electron-deficient units to build acceptor–acceptor (A–A) type polymers. The A–A strategy has been applied to achieve air-stable n-type polymers for organic electronics and is also expected to produce excellent electron transport properties in the resulting polymers.35–37 However, the number of A–A type PDI polymers is very limited and their device performances still largely lag behind those of other PDI-type polymer acceptors. Fig. 1 shows the reported PDI polymer acceptors with various electron-deficient comonomers.38–44 For example, PPDI-BT, which is the copolymer of PDI and the electron-deficient benzothiadiazole (BT) unit, only gave a PCE of up to 0.31% in the all-PSC application.38 As far as we know, the best PCE of all-PSCs based on A–A type PDI polymer acceptors has been obtained from the PTB7-Th:PPDI-TPTQ system with a value of only 3.52% (Fig. 1).43 Hence, considering the importance of understanding the structure–property relationship and developing the general design principle of new type PDI polymer acceptors, it is highly important and challenging to further develop A–A type PDI polymer acceptors by either modifying the PDI moiety or selecting a suitable electron-deficient unit (A) with the aim of increasing the photovoltaic performances of all-PSCs.

Herein, we first introduced the electron-deficient 4,7-dithienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) unit to copolymerize with PDI to prepare the A–A type PPDI-DTBT polymer acceptor (Fig. 2), and then we replaced the PDI with a fused PDI moiety to synthesize another A–A type PFPDI-DTBT (Fig. 2). Our previous results have shown that the fused PDI-based polymer could efficiently improve the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding all-PSCs.45 The optical, electrochemical, density functional theory (DFT) and photovoltaic properties of both polymers and their blend films were investigated systematically. When PTB7-Th was selected as the polymer donor, all-PSCs with PPDI-DTBT as the electron acceptor exhibited a promising PCE of up to 4.07%, whereas PFPDI-DTBT based all-PSCs provided a significantly enhanced PCE of up to 6.23%, which is ca. 75% higher than the best PCE of 3.52% reported for a PTB7-Th:PPDI-PTPQ device and is also the best photovoltaic performance for all-PSCs based on A–A type PDI polymer acceptors (Fig. 1).

Discussion
Synthesis

Scheme 1 shows the synthetic routes to the two polymeric acceptors PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT. The monomers, 1, 2 and 3, were synthesized by following the literature methods.45–47 The polymer acceptors, PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT, were prepared by Stille polymerization of 1 and 3 with 2, respectively, in a Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3 catalyst system. The molecular weights of both polymers were measured by high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene at 150 °C as the eluent. The number-average molecular weights (Mns) were found to be 85.4 and 107.8 kDa for PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT, respectively, with a polydispersity index of 2.05 and 2.31, corresponding to the repeat units of ∼65 and ∼48. The long branched 2-octyldecyl side chains in the PDI units of both polymers were used to ensure their solubility; however, PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT still have limited solubility in chlorinated solvents, such as chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene, at room temperature, but show good solubility in hot solvent, which is believed to be due to strong intermolecular interactions and/or the relatively high molecular weights of both polymers.

Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption properties of PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT were measured in chlorobenzene solution and in film states. As shown in Fig. 3a, in dilute chlorobenzene solution, PPDI-DTBT exhibits three absorption bands with peaks at around 337 nm, 503 nm and 641 nm with a molar coefficient of up to 3 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (Fig. S1†). The highest energy absorption was assigned to the n–π transition of DTBT unit in the polymer main chain. The higher energy and structureless absorption band at ∼503 nm appeared to be the mirror of the PDI spectrum, and exhibited an ∼12 nm hypsochromic shift of the absorption peak compared with that of PDI parent compound. The slightly weak absorption band at longer wavelength was caused by the interaction between PDI and DTBT monomers, and the relatively weak interaction is believed to be from the large PDI unit in the A–A type conjugated polymer, in which the long-range interaction along the non-linear polymer chain of PPDI-DTBT was restricted.48,49 In the thin film state, the absorption spectrum is almost identical to that recorded in the dilute solution (Fig. 3a), which suggests that there is minimal aggregation in the condensed film state. For PFPDI-DTBT with the fused PDI unit, as shown in Fig. 3b, the absorption spectra shows similar structured features compared to those of PPDI-DTBT, but having an additional intense absorption band at ∼400 nm, which is the characteristic absorption of the fused PDI unit and can be ascribed to the electronic transition that promoted the electron from the ground state of the PDI subunit to the π* orbital of the bridging CC bonds in the fused PDI.49 From the absorption spectra of PFPDI-DTBT in dilute solution, it can be found that the absorption band at 460–540 nm, which is from the fused PDI moiety, shows a dominant peak at ∼481 nm with a shoulder at ∼526 nm, while in the thin film state the absorption peak at ∼524 nm becomes predominant with a shoulder at ∼479 nm. The change may imply that there are strong intermolecular aggregations of the PFPDI-DTBT polymer chains in the condensed state. In addition, the absorption band from the interaction of FPDI and DTBT at ∼640 nm becomes very weak in both the dilute solution and film state of PFPDI-DTBT compared to that of PPDI-DTBT. This is due to the large torsion configuration of the FPDI unit that will minimize the interactions between the adjacent FPDI-DTBT repeat units, which results in blue-shifted absorption spectra of PFPDT-DTBT compared to those of PPDI-DTBT.48 The optical band-gaps of PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT estimated from the absorption onset in the film states are 1.59 eV and 1.71 eV, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, the absorption spectra of both PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT complement the absorption spectrum of PTB7-Th very well, which is why it is a widely used donor polymer in all-PSCs.

Density functional theory calculations
To further understand the optical properties, the ground state geometric structures of the dimer of PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT with two repeat units were calculated with DFT at B3LYP/3-61G*. The 2-pentylhexyl chains on PDI or FPDI units were replaced by methyl groups to reduce the calculation time, and these simplifications do not affect the results since the alkyl side chains have little influence on the electronic structures of the polymers. As shown in Fig. 4, the dihedral angle between PDI and DTBT units in the dimer of PPDI-DTBT is about 48–49°, while the dihedral angle between FPDI and DTBT units in the case of PFPDI-DTBT increases to 57–62°, which means that there is larger backbone torsion than that of PPDI-DTBT, and will certainly affect the electron delocalization over the polymer backbones. In addition, it can also be found that the PDI unit in PPDI-DTBT is not flattened with a large torsion structure. In PFPDI-DTBT, the fusion of two PDI units through the vinyl bond limits the torsion of PDI itself; instead there is a small torsion between the two PDIs, which is in agreement with the reported structure of the PDI dimer.48 The more flattened and planar PDI structures in PFPDI-DTBT may be more favorable for electron transport. Fig. 4 also shows the HOMO and LUMO orbital distributions of the dimer of PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT. For PPDI-DTBT, it can be seen that the HOMO energy levels are mainly delocalized on the DTBT unit, but are also extended to the PDI unit partly, whereas the LUMO energy levels are mostly localized on the PDI unit with a small distribution on the DTBT unit. However, in the case of PFPDI-DTBT, it is found that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are exclusively delocalized on the DTBT and FPDI units, respectively. This means that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are well separated in PFPDI-DTBT and possess a very small overlap. With these results, it may be possible to explain the very small charge transfer peaks observed in the absorption spectrum of PFPDI-DTBT, and attributes the stronger charge transfer peaks in the spectrum of PPDI-DTBT to the large overlap in the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels for PPDI-DTBT are at −5.33 eV and −3.42 eV, respectively. For PFPDI-DTBT, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are at −5.65 eV and −3.80 eV, respectively.

Electrochemical properties
To investigate the electrochemical properties so as to obtain the HOMO and LUMO energy levels experimentally, the reduction potentials of PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT were measured by a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method with ferrocene as the internal standard (Fc+/Fc = 0). The LUMO energy levels of both polymers were calculated from the onset of the reduction potential using the empirical equation ELUMO = −e(Vred + 4.80 − VFC).50 As shown in Fig. 5a, the onsets of the reduction potentials of PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT were estimated to be −0.55 V and −0.38 V, respectively, and therefore the LUMO energy levels of PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT were found to be −3.87 eV and −4.04 eV, respectively. The HOMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.46 eV and −5.75 eV from the band-gaps and LUMO energy levels of PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5b, it can be found that the LUMO energy levels of PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT are very similar to that of PC71BM (−3.90 eV to −4.00 eV), which is a widely used fullerene-based electron acceptor in PSCs. The low-lying LUMO energy levels of PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT and their n-type properties give them high potential as non-fullerene polymer acceptors in all-PSCs. The LUMO differences for PTB7-Th with PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT are ca. 0.27 eV and 0.44 eV, respectively, while the differences in the HOMO energy levels for PTB7-Th and the polymer acceptors are ca. 0.26 eV and 0.55 eV for PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT, respectively. These energy differences of LUMO and HOMO energy levels between PTB7-Th and PPDI-DTBT (or PFPDI-DTBT) will be able to ensure efficient exciton dissociation.

Photovoltaic properties
On the basis of the well matched absorption spectra and energy levels of PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT as the electron acceptors with the electron donating polymer PTB7-Th, the photovoltaic properties of both polymer acceptors in all-PSCs were examined on bulk heterojunction solar cells with the conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT (or PFPDI-DTBT)/Ca/Al. The initial measurements for different weight ratios of PTB7-Th and PPDI-DTBT (or PFPDI-DTBT) of 1.5:1, 1:1 and 1:1.5 were made and it was found that the optimized weight ratio was 1:1; the photovoltaic performances are shown in Table S1.† The processing solvent of the optimized devices is chlorobenzene at a total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 (see the Experimental section for more details). The optimized thicknesses of PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT and PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT are 93 nm and 101 nm, respectively. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables S2 and S3.†
The initial devices fabricated from the chlorobenzene solution of PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT (or PFPDI-DTBT) exhibited a PCE of 3.58% with a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 10.43 mA cm−2 and a FF of 44% for PPDI-DTBT based all-PSC and a PCE of 5.31% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 12.48 mA cm−2 and a FF of 56% for the PFPDI-DTBT based all-PSC. Further optimizations found that the device performances of PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT (or PFPDI-DTBT) blends are very sensitive to the kind of solvent additives used. For the PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT devices, it was found that the device performance decreased slightly with a PCE of 3.55% when 1% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was mixed with chlorobenzene, while the PCE further deteriorated to 3.39% with the addition of 1% (v/v) diphenylether (DPE); the reduced device performances are mainly due to the decreased Jsc for both cases (Table S2†). It is surprising that the device performance of PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT was found to be improved with an enhanced Jsc and FF upon adding a small amount of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN). Fig. 6a shows the best J–V curve of the PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT device with 3% (v/v) CN. The best PCE was 4.07% with a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 10.65 mA cm−2 and a FF of 49%. Similarly, in the case of the PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT device, the device performance decreased to 4.54% when adding 1% (v/v) DPE as the solvent additive, while adding 1% (v/v) CN led to a slight improvement of the PCE to 5.65% with an increased FF, but having a decreased Jsc. However, in contrast to the decreased performance with DIO in the PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT device, it is found that the PCE could be improved to 6.21% with an enhanced Jsc and FF when adding 0.5% (v/v) DIO as the solvent additive for the PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT device (Table S2†). With careful optimization of the annealing temperature, the best device performance was observed with 0.5% (v/v) DIO for the PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT device, which exhibited a PCE of as high as 6.23% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 14.13 mA cm−2 and a FF of 58%, which is the best reported device performance for such A–A type polymeric acceptor based all-PSCs (Table 1), and the J–V curve is shown in Fig. 6a. It is believed that the improved device performances with CN and DIO for PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT and PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT devices, respectively, are mainly attributed to the enhanced Jsc and FF, which is related to a morphological improvement with the corresponding solvent additive. The observed lower Jsc in the PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT device than that of the PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT device is partly due to the smaller HOMO and LUMO energy level differences (0.26 eV and 0.27 eV) between PTB7-Th and PPDI-DTBT, which may affect the efficiency of exciton separation, therefore resulting in a lower current density. It is interesting that the Voc of the PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT device is only ca. 0.02 V higher than that of the PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT device; even the LUMO energy level of PPDI-DTBT is around 0.17 eV higher than that of PFPDI-DTBT. Table 1 summarizes the device performances of all-PSCs based on copolymers of PDI and various electron deficient units. It can be found that the photovoltaic performances of PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT based all-PSCs are significantly improved compared to those of PPDI-BT, PPDI-DPP, PPDI-TPTQ, etc. Especially, for the PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT device, the PCE of 6.23% is ca. 75% higher than the PCE of 3.52% for the PTB7-Th:PPDI-TPTQ device (Table 1).43 The results demonstrate that the strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance of such PDI-based polymeric acceptors by the fusion of two PDI units through a two-carbon bridge is highly efficient.

The spectral photoresponses of the PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT and PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT devices were examined using the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs). As depicted in Fig. 6b, there are broad photoresponses from 300 nm to 800 nm for both devices. For the PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT device, EQE values of 40–50% between 450 nm and 750 nm were observed with a peak value of ∼48% at 650 nm, while in the PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT device, an EQE enhancement with photoresponse values of ∼60–70% between 500 nm and 750 nm was achieved, and the EQE peak value was 64% at 640 nm. Comparing the EQE curves and absorption spectra of both the donor and acceptors (Fig. 1), it can be concluded that the photoresponses below 600 nm mainly correspond to the contributions from PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT, while the photoresponse in the region between 600 nm and 800 nm correlates with PTB7-Th. It is noted that the charge transfer peak at around 600–700 nm in PPDI-DTBT also plays a role in the photoresponse. The higher photoresponse of the PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT device than that of the PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT device suggests that a higher current density will be observed. As illustrated in Fig. 6a and Table 1, the significantly improved photovoltaic performance of the PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT device compared with that of the PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT device is mainly due to the enhanced current density, which is consistent with the results from the EQE measurements.
The photoluminescence quenching behaviors of the blend films were investigated to assess the efficiency of the photo-induced carrier generation. As shown in Fig. S2,† the fluorescence quenching efficiencies are found to be more than 96% for both PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT and PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT blend films, which means that there is highly efficient exciton collection at the interfaces of the PTB7-Th:acceptor blend film. The charge carrier transport properties of both PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT and PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT devices were measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Fig. 7 shows the J–V curves of the hole-only and electron-only devices under the same conditions. The measured hole and electron mobilities for the PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT devices are 1.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.23 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the values are 7.99 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.03 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively for the PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT devices. The more balanced hole and electron mobilities with a smaller μh/μe value of 1.14 in the PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT device will be beneficial for the improved Jsc and FF in the corresponding device, which is consistent with the measured device results (Fig. 6a and Table 1).
 Fig. 7  The J–V curves of the hole-only (a) and electron-only (b) devices. 
The surface morphology of the blend film is explored by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 8 shows the AFM height images of the PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT and PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT blend films, which reveal that both blend films exhibit relatively smooth and uniform surfaces with no significant phase separations observed. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values for the two films are 1.30 nm and 1.36 nm, respectively, for PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT and PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT films, which are in a similar range to those in our previous report and are also slighter larger than those of other PDI-based polymeric acceptors. Considering the similar morphologies of both blend films, it can be speculated that the low Jsc and FF observed in the PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT device should be mainly due to the smaller HOMO/LUMO level differences with PTB7-Th, which affect the exciton separation, and the unbalanced hole/electron carrier mobilities compared with that of the PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT device.

Conclusion
We have synthesized two novel PDI polymeric electron acceptors, PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT, based on perylene diimide and fused PDI with electron deficient 4,7-dithienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole units, respectively. The absorption spectra show a broad absorption for both polymer acceptors, which have a good absorption compensation with narrow band-gap polymer PTB7-Th. They also show that there are different polymer chain interactions and aggregation behaviors in PPDI-DTBT and PFPDI-DTBT. The DFT and electrochemical properties were also investigated. PPDI-DTBT possesses a LUMO energy level of −3.87 eV, while PFPDI-DTBT has a LUMO energy level of −4.04 eV. The photovoltaic performances of all-PSCs were investigated with PTB7-Th as the polymer donor. The PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT based all-PSC exhibited a promising PCE of 4.07%, whereas a significantly improved device performance with a PCE of 6.23% was obtained for PTB7-Th:PFPDI-DTBT, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the best device performance for all-PSCs from PDI-based A–A type polymer acceptors reported so far. The results demonstrate that the design strategy by modifying the polymer structure to limit the molecular chain interactions to achieve high performance all-PSCs is highly efficient for the development of PDI-based A–A type polymer electron acceptors.
Experimental section
Materials
Compounds 1 and 3 were prepared by following the literature method, and compound 2 was synthesized from our previous report.45,47,51 The donor polymer PTB7-Th with a Mw of 93 kDa and a PDI of 2.5 was purchased from 1-Materials Inc. Other chemicals, purchased from various commercial sources, were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated.
Synthesis of PPDI-DTBT
Compounds 1 (160 mg, 0.144 mmol) and 3 (90.3 mg, 0.144 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (4.5 mg, 0.005 mmol) and P(o-tol)3 (9 mg, 0.03 mmol) were added in a 25 mL flask, which was flushed with nitrogen. Then, anhydrous toluene (8 mL) was added into the flask under nitrogen. The mixture was flushed with nitrogen three times. Finally, the reaction mixture was heated to 110 °C for 18 hours. After that, 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene (0.2 mL) and 2-bromothiophene (0.5 mL) were added into the mixture with an interval time of 12 hours for the end-capping. Then, the cooled reaction mixture was poured into methanol to get the crude polymer, which was then dissolved in chlorobenzene, and passed through a short kieselguhr column. The collected chlorobenzene solution was concentrated and poured into hexane. The collected solid was then dried under vacuum to give PPDI-DTBT (133 mg, 74%). Due to the limited solubility of this polymer in deuterium solvents, 1H NMR was not performed. Mn = 85400, Mw = 175000, and polydispersity index = 2.05.
Synthesis of PFPDI-DTBT
PFPDI-DTBT was synthesized by a similar method to the one used for PPDI-DTBT with a yield of 85%. Due to the limited solubility of this polymer in deuterium solvents, 1H NMR was not performed. Mn = 107800, Mw = 249200, and polydispersity index = 2.31.
