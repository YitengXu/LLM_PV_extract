    , Accepted 4th April 2018First published on 5th April 2018AbstractThe reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) released from industry can help to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere while at the same time producing value-added chemicals and contributing to carbon fixation. Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is a recently developed process which accomplishes this idea by using cathodic bacteria at the expense of only minimum energy. In this study, enriched mixed homoacetogenic bacteria as cathodic biocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 with five different concentrations were evaluated to produce acetate at a constant potential. Increasing the carbon concentration showed an improved acetate production rate and carbon conversion efficiency. A maximum acetate production rate of 142.2 mg L per day and a maximum carbon conversion efficiency of 84% were achieved, respectively, at 4.0 and 2.5 g HCO3− L−1. The changes in pH due to interactive reactions between the bicarbonate (substrate) and acetate (products) were able to create a buffering nature in the catholyte controlling the operating parameters of the MES process, such as pH and substrate specificity. A higher acetate production shifted the catholyte pH toward acidic conditions, which further triggered favorable conditions for the bioelectrochemical reduction of acetate to ethanol.
Introduction
Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) are one of the most promising emerging technologies for the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to multicarbon compounds through biocathodic reactions using specific bacteria or microbial consortia as biocatalysts. This process is termed microbial electrosynthesis (MES) or bioelectrochemical synthesis.1,2 The is a tremendous research focus on MES by the global research community due to its potential application in the conversion of CO2 into multicarbon and value-added compounds at the expense of only a minor amount of energy.3–5 The advantages of the process also can be stated in terms of CO2 reduction in the atmosphere and from biofuels and chemicals production causing the emission of GHGs, a low energy input for production, and the use of a renewable and low-cost biocatalyst.6–8 The energy required to drive the bioelectrochemical reduction can be generated by renewable energy sources, such as solar cells/photovoltaics, wind power, and geothermal heat.8,9 The electrical energy generated from the treatment of wastewater using microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can also be integrated with the MES of multicarbon organic compounds for making the process even more sustainable.10–13 The integration of MFCs for energy or biochemicals production by utilizing negative-valued waste streams combines integrated wastewater management and energy recovery. This could help solve the energy crisis and environmental pollution simultaneously.14,15 Several products, such as acetate, methane, ethanol, butyrate, etc., have been produced through MES processes in the lab scale in several proof-of-concept studies, among which acetate is the most studied product to date.16–18 Various types of biocatalysts, such as pure cultures, mixed cultures, and enriched cultures, have been used for the production of acetate. It was also identified that the reactor configuration, electrode materials, etc., influence the process efficiency.2,19–22
The acetate production rate, carbon conversion efficiency, and Coulombic efficiency are the major process parameters that need to be considered to evaluate the efficiency of this process.21 The acetate production rate is influenced by the type of bacteria/biocatalyst employed, carbon availability in the catholyte, and the electron-transfer efficiency. The current density, product specificity, and production rate are the major factors influencing the Coulombic efficiency (CE). However, all such parameters are majorly governed by the operating conditions, such as substrate availability, catholyte pH, cathodic reduction potential, biocatalyst used for the biocathode (microbial strain involved in the electrochemical reduction), electrode surface area, etc.22–25 Most of the research groups working on the acetate production through CO2 conversion have reported a maximum production rate of around 0.5 to 780 mg of acetate L−1 h−1.6,26–32 Improving the acetate production rate and operating MES system up to higher concentrations is one of the major options for improving the economics and energy efficiency. However, a higher acetate concentration has a negative influence on the biofilm stability and on catholyte pH conditions.6,33 It is also important to operate MES with higher CO2 concentrations for maximum availability of the substrate, thus increased CO2 conversion rates can be expected. At a higher acetate concentration, the acidic pH conditions trigger the further conversion of acetate to ethanol, which hampers the purity of the desired product and also the CE of the process.6,34
In this regard, the present study aimed to elucidate the effect of increasing the concentration of bicarbonates in the catholyte and its influence on the reduction reaction. It also aimed to evaluate the direct impact of bicarbonate concentration on the catholyte buffering nature during acetate production and bicarbonate consumption. Based on this, a total of nine different concentrations of bicarbonate were evaluated in the range of 1.0 to 15.0 g HCO3− L−1 (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 4.0, 8.0, 12.0, and 15.0 g HCO3− L−1, by gradually increasing the concentration). All the concentrations were evaluated with same cathodic potential under similar operational conditions. However, the system exhibited inhibition after 4.0 g HCO3− L−1. So, the present manuscript focuses on explaining the results and behavior of the MES system in the range of 1.0 to 4.0 g HCO3− L−1. An in situ-developed and enriched homoacetogenic bacterial consortium was used as the biocatalyst in a dual chambered MES system. The research findings were used to explain the pH influence on the CO2 reduction process.
Materials and methods
Blueprint of the MES reactor
An H-type bioelectrochemical reactor fabricated with glass bottles was used to study the influence of the inorganic carbon concentration. The anode and cathode chambers were separated by a Nafion 117® proton exchange membrane (PEM)6 (Fig. 1). The total and working volumes of each chamber were 0.65 L and 0.5 L, respectively. An in-house-fabricated, activated carbon based VITO-CoRE® electrodes with an active surface area of 30.0 cm2 (total surface area, 37.5 cm2) was used as both the cathode (working) and anode (counter) electrodes. Stainless steel mesh, which was used as the current collector in the VITO-CoRE® electrode, was extended outside the chamber for connection with the potentiostat system. The electrodes were placed in the respective chambers from the top and sealed to maintain the reactor airtight. Both chambers of the MES reactor were equipped with sampling ports for water and gas separately.6 A crimped rubber septum at the bottom of the reactor was used to supply N2 to maintain the system as anaerobic. A standard Ag/AgCl (3.0 M KCl) reference electrode was placed in the cathode chamber as the reference electrode.

MES modus operandi
An MES reactor with an electroactive cathodic biofilm that has developed on VITO-CoRE® electrodes when using bicarbonates as a substrate in batch mode operation was utilized in this study.5 The MES reactor was operated with bicarbonate as the substrate, and the substrate concentration was gradually increased after 7 cycles of operation with each concentration (from 1.0 to 4.0 g HCO3− L−1). The subsequent concentrations, such as 8.0 and 12.0 g HCO3− L−1, were operated for 2 cycles only. In the case of 15.0 g HCO3− L−1, only a single cycle was operated due to the inefficiency at higher bicarbonate concentrations. Out of the eight different concentrations studied, the MES system was found to show reduction properties only in the range of 1.0 to 4.0 g HCO3− L−1. Hence, the discussion herein is confined to this range only (although brief details of higher concentrations are presented in the ESI†). Shifting the operation from one concentration to the next higher concentration was done over 7 consecutive batch operations. Seven cycles were considered as sufficient time for adaptation and also as replicates. The average values of these replicates were plotted. The optimized cathodic potential of −800 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) was constantly used for the whole study. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 5 days for each batch was optimized based on the reduction current signal at 1.0 g L−1 concentration and the same HRT was continued uniformly for the rest of the variations and operated at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C) with a magnetic stirrer (100 rpm for the catholyte). Every feed change (catholyte) event was preceded by allowing settling of the suspended biomass/biocatalyst under non stirring conditions, and then 90% of the feed was carefully replaced with fresh feed. A BioLogic potentiostat (model: VMP3, France) was used to apply the controlled cathodic potential of −800 mV vs. Ag/AgCl through the chronoamperometry (CA) technique. The rest of the present manuscript reports potentials vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode, unless otherwise stated.
Electrolyte and substrate
According to the design of operation, 500 mL of electrolyte was used for the anode and cathode. A phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 25 mM) along with a bicarbonate source and trace elements solution was prepared for the catholyte, as reported elsewhere5,28 As bicarbonate strongly influences the pH of the solution, a mild phosphate buffer was used to control the sudden fluctuations in the catholyte pH. For different concentrations of carbon source, both bicarbonate equivalents (from sodium bicarbonate) and trace element concentrations were changed proportionally. Similarly, the anode was filled with 500 mL of 25 mM phosphate buffer. Anaerobic conditions were assured by supplying N2 gas at a flow rate of 2 mL min−1. As an enriched mixed consortium was the catalyst in the biocathode, methanogenic activity could develop during long time operation. This methanogenic activity could decrease the acetate concentration by converting it to methane. Bromoethanesulfonic acid (BESA), which is an inhibitor of methanogenic activity, was therefore added at a concentration of 500 mg L−1 (ref. 35, 36) to overcome the methanogenic activity. The inlet pH of the catholyte was maintained at 7.0. However, due to 10% of this being left in the cathode chamber, it influenced the initial pH in the reactor. Fresh bicarbonate solution with the same concentrations along with the vitamin and mineral solution was replaced in the MES system. A similar protocol was continued in all the study experiments. Liquid samples were collected and stored to estimate the acetate and bicarbonate concentrations. The feed change and sampling operations were done under a N2 environment to ensure the anaerobic microenvironment in the reactor.
The role of bicarbonate concentration on the bioelectrochemical reduction of CO2 was evaluated at various carbon concentrations using bicarbonate as a substitute for dissolved CO2 gas. This was done to avoid the operational challenges associated with CO2 gas.
Analysis
Liquid samples were collected from the reactors for quantitative analysis of the volatile fatty acids (VFA), ethanol, and bicarbonates and the pH at pre-defined time intervals. At each time point, only 5 mL of the volume was drawn and the same volume of fresh media was injected to maintain the total volume constant. This though could lead to a change in the composition of the catholyte; however, the change was considered negligible. The collected samples were immediately transferred to a −20 °C freezer and stored until needed for further analysis. VFAs, such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, along with ethanol, were analyzed through HPLC using an RID detector (Agilent 1260) connected to an Agilent HPLC 1200 instrument at a set wavelength of 215 nm. An Agilent Hi-Plex column 8u (3000 mm × 7.7 mm) was used and operated at 60 °C equipped with a guard column made of the same material. Isocratic gradient phosphoric acid of 0.05% was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. The standard injection volume for each sample in the HPLC was 20 μl. EZchrom software of Agilent was used for the data analysis. A calibrated WTW Multi 340i pH meter was used for the pH analysis. The bicarbonates or dissolved CO2 was quantified by an indirect estimation method using total inorganic carbon (TIC) analysis. The stored liquid samples were thawed and analyzed by adapting the methodology developed in ISO 8245, with a TOC analyzer (Multi N/C 3100 of Analytik Jena) with an auto-sampler (APG 49 of Analytik Jena) used for the TIC analysis.
Results and discussion
Substrate concentration influence on the acetate production rate
The solubility of CO2 in water is limited to 1.685 g CO2 L−1 (0.0383 M) under standard pressure and temperature.37,38 The solubility rate of CO2 depends on several factors, such as the purging conditions, pH of the catholyte or buffer used, and the rate of CO2 reduction due to the bioelectrochemical reaction. The reaction kinetics is also influenced by the substrate concentrations present in the catholyte. Different concentrations of bicarbonate evaluated showed an influence on the bioelectrochemical reduction reaction. Each concentration variation was run for 7 consecutive batch cycles with fresh bicarbonate solution added to the MES system considering 5 days as the operation time for each batch. The acetate production rate exhibited the concomitant adaptation of MES to each substrate variation along with the number of operating cycles. The acetate production rate increased constantly in each cycle and reached a stable performance phase by the fourth cycle (Fig. 2a). Among the experimental variations studied, the rate of bicarbonate reduction to acetate production was found to be correlated with the availability of the substrate in the catholyte. Here, the biocathode reduction potential was also found to dependent on the bicarbonate concentration. The highest acetate production rate of 142.2 mg L−1 d−1 was identified with 4.0 g HCO3− L−1 (711.1 mg L per cycle, average) and lowest of 35.5 mg L−1 d−1 with 1.0 g HCO3− L−1 (177.3 mg L per cycle, average). Whereas at 2.5 g HCO3− L−1, both the acetate production rate and concentration per cycle were limited to 102.4 mg L−1 d−1 and 512.0 mg L per cycle (average), respectively. The cumulative acetate production was also documented to be maximum with 4.0 g HCO3− L−1 (4.98 g acetate L−1), followed by 2.5 g HCO3− L−1 (3.58 g L−1), 2.0 g HCO3− L−1 (2.15 g L−1), and 1.5 g HCO3− L−1 (1.45 g L−1) (Fig. 2b). The minimum acetate production rate of 1.24 g L−1 was reported with 1.0 g HCO3− L−1.

Conversion efficiencies
Reduction current and Coulombic efficiency
Biocathodic reduction for the production of acetate was indicated by the reduction current at the cathode. Chronoamperometry was used to quantify the reduction current and to correlate with the product in the cathode chamber. The current density was found to increase with time during the startup of each experimental variation and showed a stable current density from the third or fourth cycle of operation. The current density could be directly related to the reduction reaction that occurs at the cathode involving primarily acetate production.20 The recorded current density values during 5 concentrations increased with the increase in the bicarbonate concentration (Fig. 3). Similarly, the acetate production rates also increased with the bicarbonate concentration in the catholyte. The maximum current density of −101.2 mA m−2 (average, −91.8 mA m−2) was recorded with 2.5 g HCO3− L−1, followed by 2.0 g HCO3− L−1 (−84 mA m−2, average −76.20 m m−2), 4.0 g HCO3− L−1 (−69.1 mA m−2, average −53.8 mA m−2), 1.5 g HCO3− L−1 (−63 mA m−2, average −53.40 mA m−2), and 1.0 g HCO3− L−1 (−42 mA m−2, average −39 mA m−2). The current density from the chronoamperometry was used to calculate the CE.5,29 Among the five concentration variations, the average CEs of each concentration were found to vary. In the case of 1.0 g HCO3− L−1, it showed a CE of 45.55% (average). When the bicarbonate concentration was shifted to 1.5 g HCO3− L−1, a significant drop was recorded (39.56% CE). Subsequently, gradually increasing the bicarbonate concentration resulted in an improvement in the CE (2.0 g HCO3− L−1, 40.37%; 2.5 g HCO3− L−1, 56.25%). For 1.0 and 2.5 g HCO3− L−1, the CE was found to be stable in all 7 operating cycles in each concentration, depicting the stable performance of the cathodic biofilm in accepting the electrons from the electrode surface to produce acetate. On the contrary, in the case of 4.0 g HCO3− L−1, the CE showed more fluctuations during the 7 cycles of operation. The improvement in the Coulombic efficiency might be due to the bicarbonate concentrations in the catholyte. This might have helped the acetate-producing biocathode to perform more efficiently under suitable applied potentials. In another study, it was hypothesized that the product selectivity and production rate can be influenced by the product concentrations and high current densities.39 In the case of higher bicarbonate concentrations, where we obtained more acetate concentration, the reaction at the biocathode was more favorably disposed toward acetate production, most likely due to the higher concentration of bicarbonate, which increased the conductivity13 and facilitated the efficient use of hydrogen generated at the cathode toward acetate production. Since this is the first study to test MES with increasing bicarbonate concentrations, further more detailed analysis is required to optimize the balance between the reduction current and its selective usage toward acetate production.

Carbon conversion efficiency
Carbon equivalents of bicarbonate were considered for calculation of the carbon conversion toward acetate production through the biocathodic reduction reaction with the electron equivalents generated by the applied potential. Carbon consumption during each individual cycle was gradually increased with time, which indicated that the acetate production was occurring. The carbon consumption at the end of the 5th day of each cycle was increased with the number of cycles of operation (Fig. 4). The carbon consumption was found to increase with the increase in the availability of the substrate in the catholyte, which was in good correlation with acetate production. The highest average carbon consumption was recorded with 4.0 g HCO3− L−1 (600 mg L per cycle) and the lowest was with 1.0 g HCO3− L−1 (123 mg L per cycle). In the case of the 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 g HCO3− L−1 conditions, the average carbon consumption values were registered, respectively, as 138.8, 192.5, and 291.0 mg L per cycle. Carbon equivalents calculated based on the produced acetate concentration in each cycle of operation and analyzed bicarbonate consumption were calculated through TOC and correlated to compute the carbon conversion efficiency (%). Except for 4.0 g HCO3− L−1, all the experimental variations were showed more than 70% of the carbon was bioelectrochemically reduced to acetate. However, the carbon conversion efficiency was found to vary based on the bicarbonate concentration. Average values from the 7 cycles of operation for each experimental variation helped gain a more precise understanding of the carbon conversion efficiency. All the average values were exhibited in a narrow range. The maximum carbon conversion efficiency of 84% was registered with 2.5 g HCO3− L−1, followed by 2.0 g HCO3− L−1 (82%), 1.5 g HCO3− L−1 (75%), 1.0 g HCO3− L−1 (74%), and 4.0 g HCO3− L−1 (67%). The documented loss of bicarbonate was majorly due to two factors. One, carbon conversion to acetate and another the subsequent conversion of acetate to biomass production in the cathode chamber. It was also possible that a higher evaporative loss of bicarbonate occurred at high concentrations due to the continuous sparging of N2 with the lower rates to maintain anaerobic conditions.

Product and substrate regulating cathodic pH
The pH of the electrolyte is another critical factor that can regulate the bioelectrochemical reduction reaction. The optimum pH for homoacetogenic bacteria was identified as being neutral to mild acidic conditions.38–41 In the case of bicarbonates, a similar phenomenon follows. However, the use of bicarbonates as a substrate in the mild phosphate buffer in batch mode operation helps to control the pH as favorable for the biocathodic reduction reaction. The electrochemical potential window for both acetate and ethanol production from CO2 was found in a narrow range of 280 and 310 mV vs. SHE (eqn (1) and (2)). The produced acetate could be further converted to ethanol at a standard electrochemical potential of 390 mV (eqn (3)).42 In the present study, the inlet pH of the catholyte was set to 7. With the time of operation, the pH of the system increased due to the consumption of CO2 and the hydroxide (OH−) ions in the electrolyte that stimulate mild alkaline conditions. At the same time, bioelectrochemically consumed CO2 produces acetate, which creates an acidic environment. Theoretically, OH− ions create a stronger alkaline environment compared to acidic environment that can be created by the acetate ions. Thus, the resultant pH of the catholyte will be overall slightly alkaline. Moreover, the stoichiometric production of one mole of acetate leaves two moles of hydroxide ions in the catholyte. In the present study, during the biocathodic reduction process, the inlet pH of catholyte at 7.0 was changed differently depending on the concentrations of bicarbonate (Fig. 5). In the case of lower bicarbonate concentrations, such as 1.0 and 1.5 g HCO3− L−1, the pH of the catholyte was gradually increased toward alkaline conditions with increasing time of operation. By end of the 5th day of operation, the final pH reached 7.8 ± 0.16 and 8.24 ± 0.21, respectively, for 1.0 and 1.5 g HCO3− L−1. In the case of the 2.0 HCO3− L−1 conditions, the pH was increased at a higher rate and reached 8.6 ± 0.38. Interestingly, in the case of 2.5 and 4.0 HCO3− L−1, the pH increased for up to 30 h of operation (7.59 ± 0.15, 2.5 HCO3− L−1 and 7.71 ± .20, 4.0 HCO3− L−1). Later it showed a slow decrease in pH and stabilized at neutral to mild acidic conditions (at the end of the cycle, 6.98 ± 0.41, 2.5 g HCO3− L−1 and 6.76 ± 0.25, 4.0 g HCO3− L−1) (Fig. 5). This might have been due to the high amount of acetate production, which can trigger acidic conditions in the system. Compared to the 2.5 g HCO3− L−1 condition, the 4.0 g HCO3− L−1 condition showed a high and rapid drop in pH, where it exhibited acidic conditions by 48 h of operation. Both the substrate and product concentrations were found to regulate the pH of the catholyte to give favorable biocathodic reduction conditions, which also suggested that operating at 2.5 and 4.0 g HCO3− L−1 were suitable for acetate production from inorganic carbon sources. It was also identified that a more alkaline pH is detrimental to the cathodic biofilm, while biofilm stability can be increased at neutral to mild acidic conditions.5 2CO2− + 8e− + 8H+ → CH3COOH + 2H2O (−280 mV vs. SHE)(1) 2CO3− + 12e− + 12H+ → CH3CH2OH + 3H2O (−310 mV vs. SHE)(2) CH3COOH + 4e− + H+ → CH3CH2OH + H2O (−390 mV vs. SHE)(3)

It was understood that the substrate and product concentrations influence the pH conditions of the catholyte. A neutral pH was found to be favorable for the effective substrate conversion to product.43 Acidic conditions of the catholyte also elicit solventogenesis. The tendency of the catholyte toward acidic conditions was higher when at higher bicarbonate concentration and increased the acetate concentration in a cycle of operation. Apart from an acidic pH, the acetate concentration also triggers solventogenesis. Here, ethanol was produced in the catholyte at minor concentrations (Fig. 6). At lower concentrations of bicarbonates, ethanol production was found to be negligible (1.5 g HCO3− L−1, 8 ± 5 mg ethanol L−1; 2.0 g HCO3− L−1, 16 ± 4 mg ethanol L−1 at the 5th day of operation). However, at 1.0 g HCO3− L−1, the ethanol concentration was not detectable. In the case of 2.5 g HCO3− L−1, the ethanol concentration increased to 18 ± 8 mg L−1. The maximum ethanol production of 65 ± 15 mg L−1 was identified at 4.0 g HCO3− L−1 (Fig. 6). The sudden increase in ethanol concentration with 4.0 g HCO3− L−1 might be due to the above-mentioned two factors, namely the acidic pH and higher acetate concentration triggering solventogenesis. In the biochemical evaluation for VFA and ethanol through HPLC analysis, no other multicarbon organic acids, such as propionate and butyrate, were found in the catholyte, suggesting that the system was not supported for chain elongation.44 The production of ethanol along with acetate hampers the product specificity and Coulombic efficiency. Homoacetogenic bacteria developed from mixed consortia used as a biocathode for acetate production are effective in a neutral to mild alkaline pH range.45 However, the prevailing mild acidic conditions at 2.5 and 4.0 g HCO3− L−1 conditions were favorable for ethanol production, promoting the further conversion of acetate to ethanol. Along with solventogenesis, the direct conversion of CO2 to ethanol is also possible in a bioelectrochemical way.1,13,46

Adaptability of biocathode at varied substrate conditions and its stability
The stability of the electroactive biofilm is very much important for bioelectrochemical systems. Along with the biofilms, it was identified that bacterial cells present in suspension also contribute to the electrochemical reduction reaction.8,17,33,47 Biofilm formed on the cathode acts as a catalyst and triggers all the bioelectrochemical reactions. It was observed that bioelectrochemical reactions are effective with biofilm formed on the electrode rather than biomass present in the suspension. A stable biofilm that can be sustained at varied environmental conditions is crucial and limits the overall performance of the MES system. After operating the MES with 4.0 g HCO3− L−1 and identifying a drop in performance, the system shifted back to 2.5 g HCO3− L−1 and was operated under similar conditions to regain the performance. Soon after recovery, gradually the system was operated with higher bicarbonate concentrations, such as 4.0, 8.0, and 12.0 g HCO3− L−1. At the bicarbonate concentrations of 8.0 and 15.0 g HCO3− L−1, the system was found to be inhibited completely. Further, the same system was operated at 2.5 g HCO3− L−1, so the system was shifted back to 2.5 g HCO3− L−1, where it regained performance and showed a similar productivity in terms of the acetate production rate, Coulombic efficiency, and carbon conversion efficiency. However, it took 4 cycles of operation (20 days) to regain the process.
The system was also analyzed for the adaptability of the MES process during a gradual changing of the feed to a higher concentration. The gradual increment in bicarbonate concentration in the system showed faster adaptability. The adaptability was majorly considered for the stable current density and acetate production rate. In the case of 1.0 to 1.5 g HCO3− L−1, the system showed a stable acetate production rate within 3 cycles of operation. In the case of bicarbonate concentrations of 2.0 and 2.5 g HCO3− L−1, a stable system performance was attained by the 4th cycle of operation. In contrast to the lower bicarbonate concentrations, 4.0 g HCO3− L−1 did not show stability even up to 7 cycles of operation.
Conclusions
Experiments on the microbial electrosynthesis (MES) of acetate with five substrate concentrations evidenced that the acetate production rate was influenced by the available bicarbonate in the catholyte. The bicarbonate concentration and the produced acetate concentration in the catholyte regulated the pH and the buffering nature of the catholyte. Neutral pHs were sustained with 2.5 g HCO3 L−1 concentrations. As the bicarbonate concentration was increased to 4.0 g HCO3 L−1, the total performance of the system was hampered, leading to increased ethanol production. The Coulombic and carbon conversion efficiencies were also found to depend on the substrate loading conditions. The biofilm stability and product specificity with different loading conditions signified the practical feasibility of the bioelectrosynthesis process. Further increases in higher carbon loading conditions could lead to an unstable process. However, to achieve improved process efficiencies at high carbon loading rates, it is required to focus the research on microbial consortia that can tolerate high carbon conditions or a hypersaline environment.
