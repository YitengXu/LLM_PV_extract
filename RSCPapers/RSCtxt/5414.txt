    , Accepted 26th January 2021First published on 28th January 2021AbstractDual-absorber photoelectrodes have been proved to have great potential in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting application due to their broadband absorption and suitable energy-band position, while the surface/interface issues are still not clearly resolved and understood. Here, during the preparation of a silicon/hematite dual-absorber photoanode achieved via synthesizing a Sn-doped hematite film on the silicon nanowire (SiNW) substrate, we separately introduced the conformal overlayer and interlayer of an Al2O3 thin film by atomic layer deposition. With the thickness-optimized interlayer (overlayer) of the Al2O3 thin film, the photocurrent density at 1.23VRHE can be enhanced from 0.85 mA cm−2 to 1.51 mA cm−2 (1.25 mA cm−2), and the on-set potential has a cathodic shift of ∼0.32 V. Although both the overlayer and interlayer modification can substantially improve the PEC performance, the underlying mechanisms are obviously different. The overlayer can only reduce the carrier recombination on the top surface and in the bulk of the hematite film; in contrast, the interlayer not only passivates the SiNW surface and bottom surface of the hematite film, but also the top surface of the photoanode due to Al3+ thermal diffusion from the bottom to the top surface of the hematite film and the resultant Al2O3 formation. This work deepens our understanding for the roles of the surface and interface engineering in the achievement of high-performance PEC systems based on dual or more absorbers.
Introduction
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell, as an effective pathway to solve the problem of energy shortage and environmental pollution, has attracted a lot of attention.1–6 The photoactive materials of the photoelectrode are vital to the PEC performances and applications,7–10 and the dual-absorber photoelectrodes (e.g., WO3/BiVO4,11 Si/WO312 and Si/α-Fe2O313) have been demonstrated to be more advantageous than the single-absorber configuration (e.g., Si,14 TiO2,15 ZnO,16 BiVO417 and α-Fe2O318). With the Si/α-Fe2O3 photoanode as an example, the following advantages have been demonstrated:19–25 (1) broadband absorption, that is, Si absorbs long-wavelength light and α-Fe2O3 absorbs short-wavelength light, and meanwhile the micro-nano structure engineering of Si bottom absorber can simultaneously increase the absorption efficiency of Si and α-Fe2O3; (2) the desired energy-band edge positions, that is, the conduction band of Si and the valence band of α-Fe2O3 are, respectively, higher and lower than the hydrogen and oxygen evolution potential of water, which is the thermodynamically basic requirement for bias-free solar water splitting; (3) complementary advantages, that is, the excellent conductivity of Si and chemical stability of α-Fe2O3 are used to improve the overall PEC performance. Although the above-mentioned aspects can significantly promote the development of a dual-absorber photoelectrode, there are still many surface/interface issues worth exploring, especially the understanding of the carrier-collection enhancement mechanism.
All PEC systems inevitably encounter the carrier recombination and trapping problems at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interfaces. The surface catalyst (e.g., Co–Pi26 and Fe/NiOOH27) or passivation layers (e.g., TiO228 and Al2O329) are popularly used to facilitate the carrier transfer from the photoelectrode into the electrolyte. The interface problems between Si and α-Fe2O3 include energy band mismatching, lattice defects and carrier recombination or trapping. The introduction of an interlayer (e.g., Al2O324) between Si and α-Fe2O3 is demonstrated to obviously improve the PEC performance. For instance, Wang et al. employed atomic layer deposition (ALD) to grow a uniform and dense α-Fe2O3 film on the SiNW substrate, resulting in ∼0.6VRHE of the low on-set potential (Von) for the SiNW/α-Fe2O3 photoanode.19 Peng et al. fabricated the SiNW/α-Fe2O3 photoanode by thermal decomposition of the Fe(NO3)3 solution, along with the introduction of Au nanoparticles for the roles of catalyst and plasmonic photosensitization, realizing an improved water-splitting efficiency without external bias.20 Wu et al. introduced an interlayer of Al2O3 film between the Si microwire and α-Fe2O3 photoanode, and revealed the effect of a thickness-varying interlayer on the carrier dynamics and surface kinetics.24 In addition, there is also a series of comparative analyses between the underlayer and overlayer in single-absorber photoanodes.30–37 Grätzel et al. conducted a systematic comparison between various underlayers and overlayers in an α-Fe2O3 single-absorber photoanode to obtain a general understanding of the surface and interface modifications.30 Su et al. introduced a TiO2 underlayer and overlayer into α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays and greatly improved the efficiency of surface charge transfer.31 Gradient doping is also used to analyze the difference between the underlayer and overlayer, for instance, Berglund et al. prepared the CuBi2O4 single-absorber photocathode by changing the growth sequence of the Cu2+ precursor and Bi3+ precursor to promote the charge separation.38 Currently, the comparative studies of the modification layer in different spatial positions are mostly related to the single-absorber photoelectrodes in planar configuration, which is entirely different from that of the dual-absorber photoelectrodes with 3D structures. Until now, for dual-absorber photoelectrodes, it is rather rare that the overlayer and interlayer are separately introduced in one dual-absorber photoelectrode to improve the surface and interface issues, and a comparative analysis for the varying mechanisms of overlayer and interlayer has just started out.
In this work, we contrastively prepared the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3, SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 with a conformal overlayer of Al2O3 thin film (i.e., SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3), SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 with a conformal interlayer of an Al2O3 thin film (i.e., SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3) photoanodes and made a comparison study between the roles of the overlayer and interlayer in the dual-absorber photoelectrode for PEC water splitting. We observed that the photocurrent density at 1.23VRHE (Jph@1.23 V) can be increased from 0.85 mA cm2 to 1.25 mA cm−2 (1.51 mA cm−2) after introducing the conformal overlayer (interlayer) of an Al2O3 thin film. The improvement can be ascribed to that both the overlayer and interlayer can increase the carrier density and decrease the carrier recombination in the bulk and on the top surface of the α-Fe2O3 film. Moreover, the interlayer can suppress the carrier recombination at the silicon-hematite interface.
Experimental
Preparation of SiNWs
All the chemicals and reagents are commercial and used without any purification. The preparation of the SiNWs is discussed in detail in our previous reports.39–41 The single-crystal n-type (100) silicon with a resistivity of 0.01–0.02 Ω cm was divided into ∼2 × 2 cm2 pieces as the substrate. The main preparation steps are as follows: (1) the Si substrate was purged by RCA cleaning and HF solutions in turn; (2) Ag nanoparticles were electroless-chemically deposited on the substrate with an AgNO3 and HF mixed solution; (3) metal-assisted chemical etching of Si with a HF and H2O2 mixed solution; (4) removing the Ag nanoparticles by HNO3 solution.
Synthesis of Sn@α-Fe2O3
The Sn@α-Fe2O3 film was prepared by thermal decomposition of a Fe(NO3)3 and SnCl4 mixed solution.21 The as-cleaned SiNW substrate was immersed into Fe(NO3)3 and SnCl4 (with a molar ratio of 20:1) ethanol solution for 15 minutes, and then thermally treated at 500 °C for 3 hours under an air atmosphere. The concentrations of Fe(NO3)3 ethanol solution were various (i.e., 0.01 M, 0.02 M and 0.03 M).
Growth of conformal Al2O3 film
A conformal Al2O3 film was introduced by an atomic layer deposition (ALD, Ensure Nanotech, 9100) system.24 The growth temperature and atmosphere were 250 °C and 30 mbar flow N2, respectively, and the used precursors were Trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H2O, respectively. The dose durations, stay durations and purge durations of TMA and H2O were 0.025 s, 5 s and 15 s, respectively. The thickness of the Al2O3 film is indicated by different cycle numbers, that is, one ALD cycle corresponds to the thickness of ∼0.08 nm.
Material characterization
Morphologies were measured by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a Hitachi S4800 and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin. HRTEM and STEM were performed on a FEI Talos F200X equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector. The phase was analyzed with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) on a MRD X′ Pert-Pro. The molecular structure and surface chemical states were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (HR800 LabRAM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, 250Xi ESCALAB). The reflectance spectroscopy was carried out on a UV-3600 Shimadzu.
Photoanode fabrication and PEC measurements
For the PEC measurements, an In-Ga conducting resin was coated on the backside of the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3, SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3 and SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, and Cu wires were attached to it by conductive tapes. The whole photoanode, except for the experimental area (∼0.2 cm2), was covered by silica gel. PEC measurements and electrochemical analysis were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CIMPS, Zennium Zahner) in a three-electrode cell. The as-prepared SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3, SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3 and SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanodes were used as the working electrode, and the Pt mesh and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was a 1 M NaOH solution (with pH = 13.6). The scan rate in the current–voltage (J–V) curves was 20 mV s−1, and the simulated one sun was from xenon light with a filter (SS-F7-3A, Enlitech). Ultraviolet (λ = 365 nm, s/n Ls 1272, Zennium Zahner) and infrared (λ = 620 nm, s/n Ls 1273, Zennium Zahner) monochromatic light sources were used for monochromatic light analysis. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was tested under a one-sun illumination at 1.23VRHE, and the sweet rate was from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The Mott-Schottky plots were performed in the dark under 1 kHz.
Results and discussion
A planar monocrystalline Si substrate is usually difficult to grow in a homogenous film by a chemical method due to its smooth surface. Since SiNWs prepared by MACE can significantly increase the absorbance and surface roughness,39–41 we constructed a series of dual-absorber photoanodes consisting of SiNW substrates and a Sn doped hematite (Sn@α-Fe2O3) film to obtain a high PEC performance. The SiNWs are randomly (vertically) arranged in the horizontal (cross-section) plane with different spacings (length of ∼3 μm) (Fig. S1†). The overall reflectance of the as-prepared SiNWs in the wavelength range of 300–1100 nm is less than 2.5% (Fig. S2†), indicating their excellent optical absorption. Although the SEM images show that the cross-sections of the as-prepared Si nanostructures are not regular circles (Fig. S3†), the overall shapes are a one-dimensional nanostructure (Fig. S4†), so we call them nanowires for simplicity, which is also employed elsewhere.19–21 Note that the so-called nanowires in our work have different morphologies as compared to the well-defined classification of nanomaterials.42,43 The schematics of the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3, SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3 and SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanodes are shown in Fig. 1a–c. After growing the Sn@α-Fe2O3 film on the SiNWs, the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode basically maintained the original shape of the SiNWs (Fig. 1d), and the thickness of the Sn@α-Fe2O3 film was ∼24 nm, indicated by the TEM analysis (Fig. 1g). When the Al2O3 film with a relatively-large thickness (e.g., ALD-100 cycles) was grown on the SiNWs, the cross-section SEM view of the SiNW/Al2O3 photoanode shows little change compared to that of the bare SiNWs, and the top-view SEM image shows some wormlike structures (Fig. S5†). The SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3 photoanode is obtained by coating the Al2O3 film on the surface of the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode, and its microstructure features (Fig. 1e) are nearly the same as that of the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode when the thickness of the conformal overlayer film is very small (e.g., 0.8 nm, as shown in Fig. 1h). The SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode represents that Al2O3 film was coated on the SiNW substrate and buried by a Sn@α-Fe2O3 film, and the top-view SEM image also shows some wormlike nanostructures (Fig. 1f and Fig. S16†). As indicated by the TEM image (Fig. 1i), the interlayer Al2O3 film thickness is ∼7 nm, and the Sn@α-Fe2O3 film thickness is ∼22 nm, suggesting that the interlayer Al2O3 film has a negligible effect on the post-growth of hematite film. The α-Fe2O3 thickness can be discernible from the TEM analysis. The Al2O3 thickness is controlled by the cycle number of the ALD process, and one ALD cycle corresponds to a thickness of ∼0.08 nm based on the experimental statistics and empirical values (using the planar and microwire substrate for growing Al2O3 with much larger thickness). Note that the actual thickness of the hematite film coated on the disordered SiNWs is not uniform, which is decided by the employed film-growth method and the uncontrolled substrate. The boundary between the Si and α-Fe2O3 layers in the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 and SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3 photoanodes can be distinguished, but the interface between the Al2O3 and α-Fe2O3 materials is hard to confirm due to the very small thickness of the Al2O3 film and the post-annealing effect. The interface of the Al2O3 interlayer between the Si and α-Fe2O3 layer is relatively obvious, and the thickness of the Al2O3 interlayer is ∼7 nm, which is consistent with the estimated result based on the ALD deposition (Fig. 1j–l). STEM analysis and EDS comparison also did not show a clear dividing line between the Si, α-Fe2O3 and Al2O3 layers (Fig. S6 and S7†), which is due to that the SiNWs are irregularly columnar and covered by Al2O3 and α-Fe2O3 films, and Al doping into hematite film can be introduced from the interlayer of Al2O3 during the thermal treatment.30

Fig. 2 shows the changes of crystalline phase, molecular structures and surface chemical states in the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3, SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3 and SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, noting that we intentionally prepared the Al2O3 and Sn@α-Fe2O3 films with the larger thicknesses (compared to the samples for PEC measurements) to make sure there was enough obvious signal for XRD, Raman and XPS characterizations. XRD patterns show that the phase of Sn@α-Fe2O3 is almost unchanged after introducing the Al2O3 overlayer or interlayer film (Fig. 2a). The Raman spectra exhibit the same characteristic peaks in the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode with and without the Al2O3 film (Fig. 2b). Reflectance spectra show that the SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode has the lowest reflectivity (Fig. S8†). The EDS comparison and corresponding SEM images in SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanodes with and without Al2O3 film further prove the element compositions. The observed Al content for the pristine sample is from the sample holder, which is made of Al material. We found that the percentage and count of Al element increases after introducing the overlayer or interlayer of Al2O3 from the changes of the height of the Al peak (Fig. S9†).

The changes of the surface chemical states are shown in the XPS spectra (Fig. S10† and 2c–f). As shown in Fig. 2c, the Fe 2P spectra are very similar for the three-type photoanodes: the finger-like peaks in Fe 2p are consistent with the previous reports for α-Fe2O3, and the characteristic peaks at ∼711.2 eV and ∼724.5 eV verify the formation of α-Fe2O3.44 After introducing the overlayer (interlayer) of Al2O3 film, the Fe 2p3/2 for Fe2+ has a shift of ∼0.5 eV (∼1.3 eV) to the lower binding energy, and the content ratio of Fe2+ increases from 4.9% to 7.8% (13.3%). The main reasons for the energy shift and content ratio rise are that the hematite film was doped by the Al element from the overlayer and interlayer of the Al2O3 film during the high-temperature annealing, and the Al dopant with a smaller radius caused the lattice strain and the decrease of Fe–O–Fe bond distance.45 As shown in Fig. 2d, the O 1s peaks in the photoanodes modified with Al2O3 can be subdivided into FeOOH, Fe(OH)O, α-Fe2O3 and Al2O3 in turn, as reported previously.44 After introducing the overlayer (interlayer) of the Al2O3 film, the FeOOH has a shift of ∼0.9 eV (∼0.5 eV) to the lower binding energy, and the sum of the content ratio of FeOOH and Al2O3 can be increased from 26.9% to 49.6% (52.0%). The Al 2p XPS spectra from the overlayer or interlayer of the Al2O3 film show no obvious changes (Fig. 2e). The characteristic peaks of Sn 3d at ∼486.2 eV and ∼494.6 eV for the photoanodes with and without the Al2O3 film are almost the same (Fig. 2f), which proves that the Sn doping is successfully introduced in the hematite film and not affected by the overlayer/interlayer of the Al2O3 film.25

Fig. 3a shows J–V curves of the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3, SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3 and SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, and the potential-dependent photocurrent densities (e.g., Jph@1.23V) and on-set potential (Von) exhibit obvious differences. Note that the thicknesses of Sn@α-Fe2O3 and the overlayer and interlayer of Al2O3 films were optimized for the champion performance and a fair comparison. The PEC performances of blank samples with either only hematite25 or silicon21 are worse than that of the SiNW/α-Fe2O3 photoanode (Fig. S11†). The SEM images and J–V curves for the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode with thickness-varying Sn@α-Fe2O3 are shown in Fig. S12 and S13.† The J–V behaviors show that the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode prepared with a 0.02 M Fe(NO3)3 precursor solution has the optimal performance (with a Jph@1.23V of 0.85 mA cm−2 and Von of 0.51VRHE). After introducing the Al2O3 overlayer on the surface of the optimized SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode, the morphology in the SEM images shows no obvious change because the overlayer is conformal and very thin (Fig. S14†). As shown in Fig. S15,† the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3 photoanode with 10 ALD-cycle Al2O3 displays the best performance (with a Jph@1.23V of 1.25 mA cm−2 and Von of 0.19VRHE). Compared with the unmodified SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode, the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3 photoanode with the optimal overlayer has a decrease in Von of ∼0.32 V and an increase in Jph@1.23V by 47%. The SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanodes with different ALD-cycle Al2O3 films show size-varying worm-like nanostructures (Fig. S16†). The Jph@1.23V of the SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode with 90 ALD-cycle Al2O3 has the optimal performance (with a Jph@1.23V of 1.51 mA cm−2 and Von of 0.19VRHE, as shown in Fig. S17†). When the optimal Al2O3 interlayer is introduced, Von is shifted to the cathodic direction for ∼0.32 V and Jph@1.23V is increased by 77% in comparison to the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode. This indicates that the Al2O3 interlayer is more prominent in improving the PEC performance in comparison with the Al2O3 overlayer. The reason for the observed shoulder in the J–V curves can be summarized as follows. (1) When the applied potential is far below 0.8 V (vs. RHE), the water-oxidation dynamics limits the photocurrent, and the shoulder might be related to a photoelectrode surface-related process with a lower oxidation potential. (2) When the applied potential is close to or over 0.8 V (vs. RHE), the photogenerated carriers can be efficiently separated and transferred into the electrolyte, and the plateau photocurrent is related to the overall amount of photogenerated carriers.46,47 Since the photovoltages are various in different photoanode systems, the potential ranges corresponding to the largest slope of the photocurrent are different. We speculate that it is from the sum of the applied potential and the photo-voltage reaching the required voltage for water electrolysis, which is usually 1.7–1.9 V when the over potential is included. The transient current densities of the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3, SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3 and SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanodes under ON-OFF cycle of one-sun illumination are shown in Fig. 3b. The photocurrent density correlations among the three photoanodes are consistent with that of the J–V curves. When the light is switched from the OFF state to the ON state, the current density shows a sharp spike, and then decreases gradually. This can be explained as a combination of the rapidly charging surface/interface states and the corresponding carrier recombination.48 The attenuation ratio is defined as (Jtransient − Jsteady)/Jtransient,49 where Jtransient represents the peak current when the light is just switched ON, and Jsteady represents the steady-state current when the light is switched OFF. The attenuation ratios of the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3, SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3 and SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanodes in the same ON-OFF durations are 30.8%, 37.8% and 41.2%, respectively, showing that both the Al2O3 overlayer and interlayer of film can obviously suppress surface recombination.

The output photocurrent for solar water splitting is determined by the three consequent processes: optical absorption (i.e., carrier generation), carrier trapping from the photoelectrode bulk to the photoelectrode surface, and carrier transfer into the electrolyte (i.e., chemical reaction at the electrode-electrolyte interface). Compared to the ordered Si microwire (SiMW) with much larger diameter and internal spacing, the disordered Si nanowires (SiNWs) also show a comparable light trapping effect, and the SiNW/hematite heterostructure possesses good optical absorption.25 While the internal spacing is too small (e.g., several tens of nanometers), the conformal and high-quality contact between the subsequently-grown film and the Si wires cannot be obtained unless the ALD technology is used, and the film thickness is also limited by the internal spacing. The surface recombination of the photogenerated carrier for the SiMWs is demonstrated to be usually smaller than that for the SiNWs due to the larger surface-defect density.50 However, the preparation of SiMWs is relatively complicated and the photoresist used in the preparation process is harmful to the environment. Considering that the preparation method/conditions and the PEC measurement conditions are different, we cannot directly declare which one shows the best PEC performance according to the presented results.19–25,51
To understand the influence of the Al2O3 overlayer and interlayer films on the carrier transport, we carried out an EIS measurement and analysis based on an equivalent circuit (Fig. 3c and S18†). The equivalent circuit includes two processes (carrier trapping on the surface states and transfer from the surface states to the electrolyte) and five simulation parameters (RS, Rtrap, Cbulk, Rct and CSS). RS represents the series contact resistance in the photoanode. Rtrap (Cbulk) represents the resistance (capacitance) of surface charge trapping. Rct (CSS) represents the resistance (capacitance) of surface charge transfer.52 The EIS spectra of the 00SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3, SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3 and SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanodes show similar shapes with different radii. The SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode with the smallest semicircle shape shows the smallest transfer resistance. The simulation parameters of RS, Rtrap, Cbulk, Rct and CSS for the three photoanodes are summarized in Table S1.† Results show that the interlayer and overlayer can reduce the trapping and transfer resistance to some extent, and the case with the optimized overlayer has the smallest trapping resistance, and the case with the optimized interlayer has the smallest transfer resistance. The overlayer of the Al2O3 thin film not only plays the role of passivating the surface and reducing the rate of surface carrier recombination (i.e., reducing Rct), but also leads to the enhanced conductivity of the hematite film via Al doping and results in the reduced Rtrap relative to that of the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode. Analogously, the interlayer of Al2O3 thin film can improve the photoanode conductivity through Al doping produced by high-temperature annealing, and surface recombination is also suppressed from the formed Al2O3 on the photoanode surface. However, the decremental degrees of Rct and Rtrap are different with the introduction of an overlayer and interlayer, and the item of Rct is decisive on the final PEC performances. We can conclude that the overlayer mainly improves the process of surface trapping states, and the interlayer mainly facilitates the process of surface charge transfer.52
To quantitatively analyze the influences of the interlayer and overlayer on the donor density (ND) of the dual-absorber photoanode, we employed Mott-Schottky analysis (Fig. 3d). ND is calculated from the slopes by the following equation:53ND = (2/εε0e)[d(1/C2)/dv]−1where ε represents dielectric constant of the photoelectrode materials, ε0 represents the permittivity of vacuum, e represents the electron charge, C represents the space charge capacitance, and d(1/C2)/dv is the slope of the Mott-Schottky plots. The positive slope of the Mott-Schottky plots indicates that the photoanode materials are n-type semiconductors, and the ND from the slopes of the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3 (1.06 × 1019 cm−3) and SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 (1.66 × 1019 cm−3) photoanodes are significantly higher than that of the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 (1.91 × 1018 cm−3) photoanode. Both the Al2O3 overlayer and interlayer films can increase the doping density and improve the conductivity, and the improvement in the degree of the interlayer is greater than that of the overlayer mainly due to the larger thickness for the optimized interlayer.53
A schematic diagram of the energy band structure and the charge transfer mechanism of the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode are shown in Fig. 4a. Energy-band bending, from the heterojunction and applied potential, facilitates carrier separation and collection. The photogenerated holes reach the photoanode surface and react with H2O to produce O2, and the photogenerated electrons are extracted to the cathode surface by an external circuit and react with H2O to produce H2. In the Si and α-Fe2O3 dual-absorber configuration, the upper absorption layer (i.e., α-Fe2O3) mainly absorbs the short-wavelength light, and the bottom absorber (i.e., Si) mainly absorbs the long-wavelength light.19 In order to figure out the effects of the overlayer and interlayer of the Al2O3 film on the PEC responses of SiNWs and the Sn@α-Fe2O3 film, we did contrast PEC measurements under two monochromatic lights (i.e., λ = 365 nm and λ = 620 nm). The λ = 365 nm light is mostly absorbed by the Sn@α-Fe2O3 film, and most of the λ = 620 nm light can pass through the Sn@α-Fe2O3 film and be absorbed by the underlying SiNWs, which can be certified by the transmittance spectrum of the Sn@α-Fe2O3 film prepared on a FTO substrate (see the insert of Fig. 4a).

The purple arrow represents the short-wavelength light absorbed by Sn@α-Fe2O3, and the red arrow represents the long- wavelength light absorbed by Si. (b)–(g) PEC performances of the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3, SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3 and SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanodes under monochromatic light illumination [i.e., (b), (d) and (f) are under light with a wavelength of 365 nm, and (c), (e) and (g) are under light with a wavelength of 620 nm]. (b) and (c) are the Jnet–V curves under light intensities of 4.5 and 6.5 mW cm−2, respectively. (d) and (e) are the light power density-dependent current densities. (f) and (g) are the transient current density curves under chopped illumination. 
The net photocurrent density (i.e., the difference in current density between under illumination and in the dark) versus potential (Jnet–V) curves, the light power density-dependent net photocurrent density (Jnet–P) curves, and the transient current density curves under chopped illumination with λ = 365 nm and λ = 620 nm illumination are shown Fig. 4b–g. In the Jnet–V curves, the magnitude relationship of the net photocurrent density under λ = 365 nm and λ = 620 nm illumination are consistent with that under the one-sun illumination, and the Von has a significantly increase compared with the one-sun illumination because the composite light can simultaneously excite the photogenerated carriers in Si and α-Fe2O3. From the Jnet–P curves, one can see that the net photocurrent density increases with increasing light power density, and the SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode consistently shows the greatest net photocurrent density. The Jnet–P curves under λ = 365 nm illumination are linear with the power density, but nonlinear for the case with λ = 620 nm. The linear trend in Fig. 4d can be attributed to the incident power of the employed single-wavelength illumination being relatively small and the hematite film having excellent absorptivity in the UV regime.3 So there is nearly no incident power to be absorbed by Si for the 365 nm wavelength illumination. From the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) versus light power density correlation, we can get that the IPCE under λ = 365 nm illumination is independent of the light power, whereas there is a gradual decline under λ = 620 nm illumination (Fig. S19†). This can be ascribed to that the conductivity of the crystalline Si substrate is much better than that of the as-prepared α-Fe2O3 film, and the photogenerated holes inside Si excited by λ = 620 nm are difficult to pass through the α-Fe2O3 film, whereas the photogenerated electrons inside α-Fe2O3 excited by λ = 365 nm can easily pass through the Si substrate with low resistance.24 The transient current density curves under chopped illumination indicate that the SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode has the largest photocurrent density and the smallest attenuation ratios [i.e., 25.6% (34.7%) under λ = 365 nm (620 nm) illumination], which is consistent with the observed PEC behaviors under one-sun illumination. This suggests that both the Al2O3 interlayer and overlayer films can passivate the top surfaces of SiNW and Sn@α-Fe2O3 film, and the interlayer of Al2O3 film shows a superior passivation effect than the overlayer, mainly because the interlayer can simultaneously passivate the surface of the SiNWs and the bottom surface of the Sn@α-Fe2O3 film.24
A comparison of the photogenerated-carrier transport in the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3, SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3 and SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanodes is visualized in Fig. 5a–c. For the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 dual-absorber photoanode, the energy-band bending from the direct contact between Si and hematite is beneficial for the carrier transfer and separation.25 The photogenerated holes diffuse or drift to the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces and participate in the water oxidation reaction, and the photogenerated electrons are extracted to the counter electrode surface and participate in the water reduction reaction. Carrier transport behavior for solar water splitting can be categorized into the following three processes: carrier separation inside the photoanode, carrier trapping by the surface states of the photoanode, and carrier transfer from the surface state into the electrolyte. In fact, both of the Al2O3 overlayer and interlayer thin films have very low resistances for the first and second processes. The key difference between the overlayer and interlayer for the SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode is that the Al2O3 works merely on the hematite absorber for the case of SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3/Al2O3, while both on the lower Si and the upper hematite absorbers for the case of SiNW/Al2O3/Sn@α-Fe2O3. Considerable amounts of the photogenerated carriers are recombined around the interface between Si and α-Fe2O3 due to the interface/surface defects, and the carrier recombination at the electrolyte/α-Fe2O3 interfaces is usually substantial due to the surface defects and sluggish dynamics for the oxygen evolving reaction (Fig. 5a). Previous results have demonstrated that the overlayer and interlayer can decrease the surface/interface defects, reduce the carrier recombination and improve the overall PEC performance for the dual-absorber photoanode. Note that there are also conspicuous differences between them. The overlayer can not only passivate the photoanode surface and reduce the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface recombination, but also result in Al doping into the hematite during a high-temperature annealing process, leading to an enhanced donor density and conductivity, and a reduced bulk recombination (Fig. 5b). The interlayer of the Al2O3 film, coated on SiNWs substrate and buried by Sn@α-Fe2O3 film, can passivate both the upper surface of the SiNWs and the bottom surface of the Sn@α-Fe2O3 film, reducing the interface recombination between SiNWs and the Sn@α-Fe2O3 film. Al doping into the hematite can also be achieved from the interlayer. The Al2O3, formed on the photoanode surface, certified by the XPS analysis, can effectively suppress surface recombination of the photoanode, leading to an improved surface-charge transfer efficiency. Note that the photogenerated electrons (holes) inside hematite (Si) can pass through the thin interlayer by a tunneling effect, leading to an increased efficiency of carrier separation (Fig. 5c).24 Compared to the case without an Al2O3 coating, the introduction of the Al2O3 overlayer can reduce both the bulk recombination and surface charge recombination of the hematite film, resulting in an increase in the efficiency of surface charge transfer; while the introduction of the Al2O3 interlayer can reduce the bulk recombination of the overall heterostructure photoanode (not only the hematite film) and lead to a bigger increase in the surface charge transfer rate.

Conclusion
In summary, we have controllably prepared SiNW/Sn@α-Fe2O3 with or without conformal Al2O3 thin film and conducted a thorough comparison study of the Al2O3 function as an interlayer or overlayer in the Si/α-Fe2O3 nanowire photoanode for solar water splitting. After introducing the overlayer (interlayer) of Al2O3 thin film, the Jph@1.23 V can be increased from 0.85 mA cm−2 to 1.25 mA cm−2 (1.51 mA cm−2), and nearly the same decrease in Von (i.e., from 0.51VRHE to 0.19VRHE) is obtained. A combination of EIS spectra, Mott-Schottky plots, XPS spectra and monochromatic PEC analysis revealed that both the overlayer and interlayer can improve the conductivity and the donor density, and passivate the photoanode surfaces. Moreover, the improvement degree of the interlayer is larger, which can be ascribed to the following three aspects. (1) The overlayer can only reduce the recombination on the surface and in the bulk of Sn@α-Fe2O3 film. (2) The interlayer can substantially passivate the upper surface of SiNWs and bottom surface of Sn@α-Fe2O3, leading to a reduced recombination at the silicon-hematite interfaces and an increased efficiency of carrier separation. (3) The introduced Al dopant from the interlayer can simultaneously reduce the carrier recombination in the bulk and on the top surface of the hematite film. This work deepens the distinguishing between the roles of overlayer and interlayer in the dual-absorber photoanode, and it is helpful to design and construct high-performance PEC systems based on multi-layered photoactive materials.
