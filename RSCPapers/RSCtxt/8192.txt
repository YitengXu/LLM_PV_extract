    , Accepted 1st March 2021First published on 1st March 2021AbstractA 2D perovskite incorporating an amine moiety with a carboxy group exhibited orientation changes as the amount of DMSO additive varied. The degree of perpendicular orientation was increased by optimizing the amount of DMSO additive, while using the bar-coating method. Moreover, film thickness and the ratio of perpendicular orientation exhibited a positive correlation.
The first organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PVCs) using CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) had a significant impact on the field after they were reported by Miyasaka et al. in 2009.1 Presently, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5% has been obtained for the PVCs,2 and their performance has improved to a level that permits practical applications. However, three-dimensional (3D) organic–inorganic perovskites (such as MAPbI3) are easily affected by moisture, oxygen, and heat,3–6 and are susceptible to degradation by water. They are decomposed into a precursor even at low levels of ambient atmospheric moisture. To address this issue, some groups have reported the application of two-dimensional (2D) perovskite compounds that exhibit an improved resistance to moisture.7–12 2D perovskites with the general formula (RNH3)2MX4 (R = CnH2n+1; M = Pb2+, Sn2+; X = Cl−, Br−, I−) feature a layered structure in which inorganic layers and organic ammonium layers are alternately stacked. The inorganic layers comprise 2D sheets of [MX6]4− octahedra connected at four corners with halide ions in the plane. It is also possible to obtain compounds analogous to these alkylammonium-based 2D perovskites using various functional moieties.13–15 Significant research has been conducted to facilitate the solar cell applications of quasi-2D perovskite compounds. These compounds have dimensions intermediate between three and two, depending on the exploitation of their high stability for various applications.16–28 Because 2D perovskites possess an organic amine layer that acts as an insulator and the [PbX6]4− layers are connected two-dimensionally, the diffusion of photogenerated carriers is limited to two directions. In solar cells, the direction of carrier transport is perpendicular to the substrate. However, the horizontal orientation of the [PbX6]4− layers to the substrate renders the migration of transport carriers in the vertical direction difficult. As a result, the power generation performance of solar cells based on 2D perovskites is significantly reduced. Our group has obtained [PbX6]4− layers that are vertically oriented using the quasi-2D perovskite (C6H13NH3)2FAPb2I7. As a result, we succeeded in producing a solar cell with a PCE of 1.73% that retained its structural integrity for a year.6
In a previous study, we fabricated 2D perovskite compounds incorporating ammonium cations with carboxy groups.20,21 They formed dimer structures based on the hydrogen bonds of the carboxy moieties. The films of these compounds were randomly oriented with respect to the substrate. In particular, the 2D perovskite 7-AHA2PbI4, with HOOC(CH2)6NH3+ (7-AHA) as the cationic species, tended to orient perpendicular to the substrate. Differential scanning calorimetry studies of the 7-AHA2PbI4 crystals exhibited phase transitions at −1.6, 12.3, and 35.9 °C. It was also reported that the high perpendicular orientation of 7-AHA2PbI4 in film-thicknesses ranging from 2–20 μm could be prepared by the drop-casting method.21 However, the films were too thick for application in PVCs because of the prevention of free carrier transport to the electrodes. Therefore, it is necessary to make them even thinner in order to apply them to devices. Y. Ju et. al. reported that N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP) could induce an intermediate phase to obtain large-area MAPbI3 films with a smooth morphology by using a single-solution bar-coating process.23 We expect that an additive with a higher boiling point than the solvents can be effective in controlling the crystal growth. There have been no reports about the preparation of perpendicularly oriented 2D monolayer perovskite using a bar-coating method, otherwise there are some papers about high quality 3D films. Success in production of perpendicular oriented perovskite by bar-coating will open the possibility for screen-printing and roll-to-roll preparation. This makes it possible to obtain large area films for solar cells and other optical devices. Herein, the single-solution bar-coating method was employed to fabricate 7-AHA2PbI4 perovskite films to achieve vertical orientation.
The amine hydroiodide, HOOC(CH2)6NH3I (7-AHAI), was prepared by reacting an equivalent amount of the corresponding amine, HOOC(CH2)6NH2, with hydroiodic acid. A precursor solution of 7-AHA2PbI4 was prepared by reacting stoichiometric amounts of 7-AHAI and PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). CHP and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were selected as additives and added to the precursor solution and stirred at r.t. for 60 min. Films were fabricated on pre-heated hydrophilic glass substrates at 75 °C by the bar-coating method using R K-Print Coat Instruments Ltd, UK with a selected wire bar: RDS20 No. 1 and No. 2 for wet thicknesses of 6 and 12 μm, respectively. The coating speed was controlled at 6.4 m min−1. After bar-coating, the films were settled at 75 °C until the solution was dry, and then annealed at 110 °C.
First, CHP was added to the precursor solution by adjusting the molar ratio of CHP:PbI2 = m:1 (m = 0.6, 1). However, the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the fabricated films exhibited rough 7-AHA2PbI4 films (Fig. S1, ESI†), As a result of which in-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were not observed. We first hypothesized that the higher the boiling point of the additive, the more effective it would be for vertical orientation and slow crystallization because the solvent is hard to remove. In the evaporation process of the Lewis base, the Lewis base-PbI2 moves vertically from the substrate, and we considered that the amine intervenes in the process of PbI2 moving upward, resulting in vertical orientation. However, the actual experiments showed that the crystallization using CHP was not uniform on the substrate. While the difference in boiling points is too large for CHP and DMF, the evaporation rate was not uneven on the substrate. In other words, the effect of CHP causes the crystals to grow vertically in solution in some areas, while the effect of CHP is absent in some areas. Next, DMSO was added to the precursor solution by adjusting the molar ratio of DMSO:PbI2 = n:1 (n = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1). Fig. 1 shows the cross-sectional SEM images of 7-AHA2PbI4 films fabricated by the bar-coating method with various molar ratios of PbI2 and DMSO additive. In the case of (a) Pb:DMSO = 1:0, parallel oriented crystal structure was observed. Meanwhile, in the case of (b) Pb:DMSO = 1:0.1 and (c) 1:0.3, obliquely oriented crystal structures were observed. For (d) Pb:DMSO = 1:0.6, a perpendicularly oriented crystal structure was observed. For (e) Pb:DMSO = 1:1, a rough film surface was observed, with a randomly oriented crystal structure. To evaluate the effect of the additive on perpendicular orientation, bar-coated 7-AHA2PbI4 films prepared with the molar ratio of DMSO:PbI2 = n:1 (n = 0, 0.6, 1) were selected for XRD measurements. As a result of out-of-plane XRD measurements of bar-coated 7-AHA2PbI4 films using the DMF solutions with the DMSO additive, diffraction patterns with the first diffraction of the (002) plane were observed at 4.7° (Fig. S2, ESI†). The d-spacing value calculated from the peak was 18.4 Å, which agreed with the previously reported data.20,21 The results suggest the formation of an orthorhombic layered perovskite structure consisting of 2D sheets of [PbI6]4− octahedra and 7-AHA layers. The orientations of the 2D structures were investigated by grazing incident in plane XRD. Fig. 2 presents the in-plane XRD patterns generated by the bar-coated films of 7-AHA2PbI4. In these in-plane XRD patterns, the diffraction by the crystal planes in the direction perpendicular to the substrate can be observed by reducing the X-ray irradiation angle to the greatest extent, following which, the orientation can be evaluated. As shown in Fig. 2(a), bar-coated 7-AHA2PbI4 films prepared without DMSO showed a diffraction peak associated with the (200) plane at 14.4°. The d-value calculated from the peak was 6.2 Å, suggesting that the [PbI6]4− layers were oriented parallel to the substrate. In the case of 7-AHA2PbI4 films (Pb:DMSO = 0.6:1 and 1:1), a diffraction peak at 4.4° corresponding to the (002) plane is observed (Fig. 2(b and c)). This peak indicates the crystalline growth partly perpendicular to the film surface. It is evident from Fig. 2 that the (002) diffraction peak of (b) was stronger than (c). This result shows that Pb:DMSO = 1:0.6 was more suitable for fabricating the perpendicularly oriented crystals. The differences in crystallisation can be ascribed to differences in the crystal growth speed. When PbI2 crystals are dissolved in a Lewis base solvent, the coordination position of iodine atoms is sequentially replaced by the Lewis base. In that case, the CO group of DMF and the SO group of DMSO coordinate to PbI2 as a Lewis base.15 DMSO has a higher boiling point (189 °C) than DMF (153 °C). Therefore, DMF evaporated preferentially when pre-annealed at 75 °C. The crystallisation becomes slower as the amount of DMSO increases. Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating the difference in crystallization depending on the amount of additive. It is proposed that the perpendicular orientation was induced onto the PbI2–DMSO–DMF intermediate, owing to the moderate evaporation speed of the solvent during pre-annealing at 75 °C; perpendicularly oriented perovskite crystals were formed following complete evaporation. Moreover, the time taken for drying the bar-coated 7-AHA2PbI4 films was 20 s for Pb:DMSO = 1:0, 2 min for 1:0.1, and 2.5 min for 1:0.3, respectively. These times were too short to result in a perpendicular orientation. For Pb:DMSO = 1:1, the duration of crystallization was 13.5 min. In this case, the crystallization rate was not controllable at various locations of the substrate because of the large amount of DMSO. It was evident that a uniform crystal structure could not be formed. On the other hand, for Pb:DMSO = 1:0.6, the speed of crystallisation growth is moderate enough to result in a perpendicularly oriented crystal. To fabricate perpendicularly oriented AHA2PbI4 crystals, an appropriate time for promoting perpendicular alignment and an appropriate growth rate for uniformly promoting the crystallization was required.

For comparative studies, films were prepared on pre-heated hydrophilic glass substrates at 75 °C by spin-coating at 2000 rpm and annealing at 110 °C. Fig. 4 shows the in-plane XRD patterns and cross-sectional SEM images of the 7-AHA2PbI4 films fabricated by (a) spin-coating and (b) bar-coating methods with DMSO (ratio of mediator: Pb:DMSO = 1:0.6). In the spin-coating film, a diffraction peak was not observed at 4.4°, and the SEM image indicates the formation of parallelly oriented perovskite crystals. It is evident that the spin-coating method with DMSO was not effective for the formation of perpendicularly oriented 7-AHA2PbI4 crystals. Because the spin-coating method is a preparation method using centrifugal force, parallel oriented crystals were induced. The solvent is first removed by high-speed rotation and crystallisation is promoted. Therefore, the bar-coating method was found to be more suitable than the spin-coating method for single solutions.

The relationship between the thickness of the films fabricated under various wire bar conditions and the ratio of vertical orientation is plotted in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The film thickness was obtained from cross-sectional SEM images. If the thickness varied, average values and standard error were used (the thickness was measured 8–14 times). The rate of vertical orientation was calculated by dividing the intensity of the (002) diffraction peak by the sum of the intensities of the (002) and (200) peaks. [Rate of vertical orientation/%] = (Ihor/Whor)/[(Ihor/Whor) + (Iver/Wver)] × 100. By dividing the integrated intensity by the integral width, an accurate ratio for the crystallinity could be calculated.21 Fig. S4 (ESI†) scatter plot shows a correlation coefficient of 0.51, indicating that, for a film thickness of 0–2.5 μm, the thicker the crystal films, the higher the percentage of perpendicular orientation. The highest percentage of vertical orientation was 54%, where the film thickness was around 2.1 μm. Furthermore, it was suggested that the vertical alignment structure was easily formed stably between 1.5 and 2.5 μm.
In conclusion, the 2D perovskite compound 7-AHA2PbI4 with crystalline growth partially perpendicular to the substrate was obtained by using the bar-coating method by controlling the amount of DMSO additive. The DMSO additive was not found to be effective for the spin-coating method. Thinning was possible at a film thickness of 1.5 to 2.5 μm, when the ratio of perpendicular alignment was maintained at approximately 54%. Further improvements in orientation are expected by further material design.
