    , Accepted 21st May 2014First published on 23rd May 2014AbstractA new alkylthienyl substituted thieno[2,3-f]benzofuran (TBF)-based polymer (PTBFTDTBT) was synthesized and characterized. PTBFTDTBT had a high molecular weight, good solubility in common organic solvents, broad visible absorption from 300 to 750 nm, and a relatively deep highest occupied molecular orbital level (−5.2 eV). PTBFTDTBT also showed a field hole mobility up to the order of 10−2 using an organic field effect transistor (OFET) method and an order of 10−2 using a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. With the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate/PTBFTDTBT:PC71BM (1:2, w/w)/Ca/Al, a power conversion efficiency of 6.42% was obtained with a high short circuit current (Jsc) of 13.51 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 61%, under the illumination of AM1.5G, at 100 mW cm−2, without any post-treatment. The study demonstrates that TBF is a promising building block for organic electronics.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSC) offer many advantages for photovoltaic applications, including flexibility, low-cost and roll-to-roll fabrication.1 Significant progress in PSC has been achieved in the past decade by the development of new polymers and device processing. To date, power conversion efficiencies (PCE) have reached 10.6% using a tandem bulk hetero junction (BHJ) structure,2 indicating that PSC have great potential for future energy generation. The BHJ device architecture includes an active layer of a p-type conjugated polymer electron donor and an n-type fullerene derivative electron acceptor.3
The structural design of new solution-processable polymer donor materials plays an important role in the development of PSC. In the past decade, two-dimensional (2D) conjugated polymers with conjugated side chains have been introduced into PSC to improve the performance.4 The widely investigated 2D conjugated block was the alkylthienyl-substituted benzodichalcogenophene (BDC) unit, because a 2D conjugated BDC unit usually possesses a lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and stronger absorption than an alkoxy-substituted BDC unit, which are beneficial for obtaining high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Jsc).5 Huo et al., have synthesized several alkylthienyl-substituted BDC-based polymers; for example, PCE of benzodifuran (BDF)-based polymer (PBDFTT-CF-T) and benzodithiophene (BDT)-based polymer (PBDTTT-C-T) reached 6.26% and 7.6%, respectively, when 3% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as a processing additive.3d,6 Our group have also reported a BDF-based polymer with a PCE up to 6.0% without any post-treatment.7 Combining the advantages of the BDT and BDF units, the thiophene ring in the BDT unit was replaced with a furan ring, and therefore, a new donor building block: thieno[2,3-f]benzofuran (TBF)8 was envisaged. Interestingly, TBF is a non-symmetric building block, just like thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT)9 unit. TT-based regiorandom polymers show promising photovoltaic properties; for example, TT-based polymer – PTB7 – has reached a high PCE of up to 9.2% using PFN as the interface modifier.10 A polymerization reaction with a non-symmetric monomer has a tendency to form high molecular weight copolymers.11a Generally, a high molecular weight is beneficial to improving Jsc.11b
Based on the above considerations, we designed and synthesized a new TBF-based 2D-conjugated polymer, poly{4,8-bis(2′-ethylhexylthiophene)thieno[2,3-f]benzofuran-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-5′,6′-dioctyloxy-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)} (PTBFTDTBT, shown in Scheme 1). The properties of PTBFTDTBT including the absorption, energy levels, charge transporting, blend film morphologies and photovoltaic properties, have been well investigated and discussed. PTBFTDTBT showed a low bandgap and a moderately high hole mobility. Using the device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/PTBFTDTBT:phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (1:2, w/w)/Ca/Al, PTBFTDTBT displayed a promising PCE of 6.42% with a high Jsc of 13.51 mA cm−2 under illumination of AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) without any post-treatment. Device performance of PTBFTDTBT (PCE = 6.4%) is much higher than PBDTTDTBT (PCE = 4.9%).12 The preliminary results demonstrate that TBF-based polymers are probably promising donor materials for high performance PSC.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials

n-Butyl lithium (n-BuLi), Pd(PPh3)4, Sn(CH3)3Cl and thiophene-3-carbaldehyde were obtained from Aladdin and Alfa Asia Chemical Co., and they were used as received without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were dried over Na/benzophenoneketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. Other reagents and solvents were purchased commercially as ACS-grade quality and used without further purification. 2-(2-Ethylhexyl)thiophene4a and 4,7-di(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-dioctyloxybenzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole (M2)13 were prepared according to previously reported procedures. All other compounds were synthesized following the procedures described here.
2.2 Characterization
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker DMX-400 spectrometer in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) solution at 298 K, unless specified otherwise. Chemical shifts were reported as δ values (ppm) relative to an internal tetramethylsilane (TMS) standard. Number-average (Mn) and weight-average (Mw) molecular weights were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with polystyrene as a standard and THF (HPLC grade) as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 at 35 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 at a heating rate of 10 K min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U-3010 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. For solid state measurements, a polymer solution in chloroform was cast on a quartz plate. The optical bandgap was calculated from the onset of the absorption band. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were recorded on a Zahner IM6e Electrochemical Workstation (Germany) with a three-electrode system in a solution of 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The polymer films were transferred on to a glassy carbon electrode (1.0 cm2) by dipping the corresponding solutions in the electrode, with a platinum wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The HOMO energy level was determined from the oxidation onset from the CV curve. Electrochemical onset was determined at the position where the current starts to differ from the baseline. Hole field effect mobility of the polymer was measured by using an OFET method performed on a Keithley 4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer. The morphologies of the polymer/PC71BM blend films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM; Agilent Technologies, 5500 AFM/SPM System, USA) with tapping-mode. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements were performed in a JEM-2100F.
2.3 Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells
PSC were fabricated in the configuration of the traditional sandwich structure with an ITO glass positive electrode and a metal negative electrode. A patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω □−1 was purchased from CSG HOLDING Co. LTD. (China). The ITO glass was cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatments in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol and then the glass was treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Jelight Company, USA) for 20 min. The PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P 4083, Germany) was used as anode buffer layer to smooth the ITO surface, and was filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(vinylidene fluoride) filter and drop-coated at 3000 rpm for 40 s on the cleaned ITO electrode. Subsequently, the PEDOT:PSS film was baked at 150 °C for 15 min in air to give a thin film. A blend of the polymer and phenyl butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (different weight ratios, 10 mg mL−1 for polymer) was dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), and spin-cast at 1700 rpm for 90 s onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. A bilayer cathode consisting of Ca (∼20 nm) capped with Al (∼40 nm) was thermally evaporated under a shadow mask with a base pressure of ca. 10−5 Pa. The active area of the PSC is 4 mm2. J–V curves were recorded with a computer-controlled Keithley 236 digital source meter. A xenon lamp with an AM1.5G filter was used as a white-light source and the optical power was 100 mW cm−2. All the fabrication and characterizations after the cleaning of the ITO substrates were performed in a glove box.
2.4 Fabrication of OFET devices
Thin-film OFETs were fabricated with a bottom-gate/top-contact configuration. Heavily p+ doped silicon wafer substrates (Si-Mat, Germany) covered with a thermally grown 300 nm SiO2 layer were used as the gate, of which the capacitance was 10 nF cm−2. The substrates were sequentially cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min each. Subsequently, hydrophilic treatment of these silicon wafers was performed according to the standard procedure. Briefly, the substrates were soaked in a mixture of deionized water, 25% ammonium hydroxide and 30% H2O2 (5:1:1 by volumetric ratio) for 20 min at 80 °C, then rinsed with deionized water and dried under a nitrogen flow. An octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) self-assembled monolayer was deposited and selected as a dielectric modification layer. Thin polymer films were prepared by spin coating of PTBFTDTBT (8 mg mL−1) in ODCB onto the OTS modified substrates at a speed of 2000 rpm (revolutions per minute) for 50 s at room temperature. With or without annealing at 150 °C under atmosphere for 10 min, gold film (50 nm) was deposited on the organic layer to form the drain and source electrodes, for a typical device. The drain–source channel length (L) and width (W) were 80 μm and 1000 μm, respectively. OFET measurements were performed at room temperature using a Keithley 4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer under ambient conditions.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and structural characterization
As shown in Scheme 1, PTBFTDTBT was prepared from M1 and M2 by Stille cross-coupling reaction with a yield of 81%, further purification was carried out by continuous extractions with methanol, hexane and chloroform, and the product was recovered from chloroform. The chemical structures of these compounds were verified by NMR (as shown in Fig. S1–S3†). The number of aromatic and aliphatic protons estimated from integration of the peaks is generally consistent with the repeating unit of PTBFTDTBT (as shown in Fig. S4†). The GPC results (using polystyrene as the standard and THF as eluent) shows that PTBFTDTBT has a Mw value of 143 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 3.3 (Table 1), both Mn and Mw are much higher than those of PBDTTDTBT (Table 1),12a which indicated that non-symmetric unit-TBF easily forms higher molecular weight copolymers compared to symmetric unit-BDT, as expected. PTBFTDTBT is readily soluble in common organic solvents such as THF, chloroform, chlorobenzene and ODCB. High molecular weight and appropriate solubility are prerequisites for obtaining high-performance PSC.11

3.2 Thermal stability
The thermal property of PTBFTDTBT was investigated using TGA, as shown in Fig. 1. TGA analysis shows that the onset point of the 5% weight loss is ca. 318 °C under an inert atmosphere, indicating that this polymer's thermal stability is adequate for the fabrication of the devices.

3.3 Optical properties
The optical properties of the conjugated polymer can be acquired from UV-Vis absorption spectra. Fig. 2a shows the UV-Visible absorption spectra of PTBFTDTBT in chloroform solution and as a thin film cast from chloroform solution on a quartz substrate, and all the related absorption data are listed in Table 2, and the related data from PBDTTDTBT has also been listed for comparison. PTBFTDTBT exhibited a broad absorption from 300 nm to 700 nm, both in solution and as a film. In solution, one absorption band, from 300 nm to 500 nm, has two peaks at around 350 nm and 430 nm, which correspond to the π–π* transition of their conjugated backbone; the other absorption band, from 500 nm to 700 nm, with a peak at around 580 nm, can be attributed to the intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption.14 Compared to their absorption in solution, the absorption band of PTBFTDTBT in film was red-shifted; the absorption edge was 761 nm in film, corresponding to the optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.63 eV. The absorption peak of PTBFTDTBT as a film (608 nm) is slightly red-shifted, by 23 nm, compared to the peak for PTBFTDTBT in solution (585 nm). More interestingly, a strong absorption shoulder peak at 640 nm emerged in the spectra of PTBFTDTBT as a thin film because of strong intermolecular π–π stacking.15

In order to further explore the absorption of PTBFTDTBT and PBDTTDTBT, absorption coefficients of the PTBFTDTBT and PBDTTDTBT films on ITO substrate, spin-coating from ODCB solution, are shown in Fig. 2b. It is observed that PTBFTDTBT film has an increased absorption coefficient and slightly red-shifted absorption compared to that of PBDTTDTBT film, which might originate from the higher molecular weight of the regiorandom copolymer PTBFTDTBT – a similar phenomenon has been reported previously.11g The increased absorption coefficient and red-shifted absorption should result in better harvesting of the solar photon flux, thus effectively leading to improved external quantum efficiency (EQE).11b,c,e

In order to insightfully investigate the electronic properties of the copolymer, CV was carried out (results shown in Fig. 3) to estimate the HOMO level of PTBFTDTBT.16 The HOMO value for PTBFTDTBT was calculated from the onset of oxidation which was then converted to a potential versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE), based on −4.4 eV SCE energy level relative to the vacuum using EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.4) (eV);16b thus, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level could be calculated according to ELUMO = Eg + EHOMO(eV).17Fig. 3 reveals that in a positive potential region, the oxidation is quasi-reversible; the onset oxidation potential (Eox) is 0.80 V, corresponding to a HOMO level of −5.20 eV, which is slightly deeper than PBDTTDTBT, and which is probably because of the stronger electronegativity of the oxygen atom compared to that of the sulfur atoms.18 PTBFTDTBT has a relatively deep HOMO level, which is beneficial for obtaining high Voc. The LUMO level was calculated to be −3.57 eV using the HOMO level and the optical bandgap. The LUMO energy level of PTBFTDTBT is positioned over 0.4 eV than that of PC71BM (−4.0 eV, measured under the same conditions), which is enough for charge separation and transfer.19 All the related CV data and the HOMO–LUMO energy levels (as shown in Fig. 4) for PTBFTDTBT are summarized in Table 2.

3.5 Hole mobility
The charge transport abilities of conjugated polymers have great effects on the photovoltaic properties. Here we measured the hole mobility of PTBFTDTBT using OFET and SCLC methods. As shown in Fig. S5(a) and (b),† the typical transfer and output curves of PTBFTDTBT by modulating white light with various intensities were measured by the OFET method. The devices exhibited a moderate p-type field-effect transistor (FET) behavior, as well as having good linear and saturation characteristics. The average hole mobility of PTBFTDTBT is 2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 among six devices. The active layer was annealed at 150 °C for 10 min, and this increased the hole mobility up to 1.53 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), which may mean that thermal annealing is beneficial to molecular ordering.

(b) Output characteristics with VDS varying from 10 V to −60 V in steps of 10 V deposited on OTS modified SiO2. (c) ln(Jd3/V2) vs. (V/d)0.5 plot of the PTBFTDTBT/PCBM blend for the hole mobility by the SCLC method. 
The hole mobility of PBFTDTBT was also measured with the SCLC model, which is based on the Poole–Frenkel law using a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTBFTDTBT:PC71BM (1:2, w/w)/Au.20 The results are plotted as ln(Jd3/V2) vs. (V/d)0.5, as shown in Fig. 5(c). Here, J is current density, d is the thickness of the device, and V = Vappl − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied potential and Vbi is the built-in potential. The SCLC model can be described by the equation: (1)
According to eqn (1) and Fig. 5(c), the hole mobility of the blend can be calculated to be 8.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Usually a higher molecular weight results in increased hole mobility;11g however, PTBFTDTBT showed a slightly reduced mobility compared to that of its analogue – PBDTTDTBT. The slightly reduced mobility probably originated from the regiorandom structure.
3.6 Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of PTBFTDTBT, PSC with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTBFTDTBT:PC71BM/Ca/Al were fabricated. The active layers were made by spin-casting the blend of PTBFTDTBT and PCBM from ODCB solution, with different weight ratios. Fig. 6 shows the J–V curves of the devices under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE are presented in Table 3. From the photovoltaic results, we can see that all of the devices show excellent photovoltaic properties, with overall efficiencies over 5%. The device using the weight ratio of PTBFTDTBT and phenyl C61 butyric methyl ester (PC61BM) equal to 1:2 (w/w) as active layer showed the best performance with a PCE of 5.33%, a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 11.64 mA cm−2 and a FF of 58%. To obtain better photovoltaic properties, PC71BM was used instead of PC61BM blended with PTBFTDTBT as active layer. All of the devices with PTBFTDTBT:PC71BM as the active layer had higher PCE than those with PTBFTDTBT:PC61BM, probably because PC71BM has a broader and stronger absorption spectrum than PC61BM, although it is of similar energy level; therefore, the Jsc as well as PCE could be effectively improved with no loss of Voc. Especially when the PTBFTDTBT:PC71BM weight ratio was 1:2, the best performance was obtained with a high PCE of 6.42%, a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 13.51 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.61. The PSC performance of PTBFTDTBT is much higher than that of PBDTTDTBT, as shown in Table 3, particularly the Jsc, which might be mainly because of the higher molecular weight and stronger absorption coefficient of PTBFTDTBT. From the photovoltaic measurement, with the increasing weight ratio of PCBM, Voc showed a decreasing trend; a possible explanation for this phenomenon may be from relatively poor film quality with higher roughness,21 as shown in Section 3.7 on morphology.

To verify the PCE of these devices, the EQE spectra of the devices based on the PTBFTDTBT:PC71BM blend as an active layer with different weight ratios (shown in Fig. 6), were investigated. The EQE curves of these devices show a broad wavelength range of 300–750 nm. The calculated photocurrent density of EQE is in accordance with the Jsc value measured from the J–V curve, within an experimental error due to the spectral mismatch of the solar simulator.22
3.7 Morphology
Besides absorption, energy levels and charge mobility, morphology of the active layer is also important for PSC. A suitable morphology is not only beneficial for exciton separation, but is also beneficial for the charge transfer to the respective electrodes and effective charge collection. AFM was carried out to investigate the surface morphology of PTBFTDTBT:PC71BM (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, w/w) blend films spin-coated from an ODCB solution. The resulting height and phase images are shown in Fig. 7. Root mean square roughness (rms) values of the blend films were obtained from AFM images and were found to be 0.77 nm, 0.95 nm and 1.57 nm, for 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 weight ratios of the PTBFTDTBT:PC71BM blend. From the images, the surface of the PTBFTDTBT:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) blend film is quite smooth, with an rms of 0.77 nm. However, when the TEM image was investigated (Fig. S6†), this blend film showed polymer spherical domains in some areas with sizes larger than the exciton diffusion length (ca. 10 nm), indicating that photogenerated excitions will probably combine before reaching the donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces, which may lead to relatively lower FF and Jsc for the 1:1 D/A blend. The blend with the 1:3 D/A weight ratio had the highest surface roughness with a less favorable phase separation, which probably explains its relatively low Voc.21 For a 1:2 D/A weight ratio, the blend showed low roughness and relatively good nanophase separation, as shown in Fig. 7 and S6.† Generally, the nanoscale phase separation can contribute to the formation of a bicontinuous D/A network. Using solvent mixtures or high boiling point solvent additives can usually improve the morphology of the active layer, and probably further assist the formation of a better network to increase the PCE.16a,23

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we changed the hetero atom (O/S) of the polymer backbone, and a new 2D TBF-based polymer (PTBFTDTBT) was designed and synthesized. This small change in the hetero atom (replacing one S in a BDT ring with an O) in the polymer backbone has many advantages, such as increased molecular weight, enhanced absorption coefficient and deeper HOMO level, thus affecting the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells. In this work, the bandgap, photophysical properties and electronic structure of PTBFTDTBT were characterized. PTBFTDTBT exhibited a relatively deep HOMO level of −5.20 eV, a broad absorption and a moderate hole mobility. The PSC based on the blend of PTBFTDTBT and PC71BM (1:2, w/w) exhibited the best device performance with a PCE of 6.42%, a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 13.51 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61% under illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 without any device modifications or post-treatment. These investigations indicate that PTBFTDTBT is a promising donor for PSC.
