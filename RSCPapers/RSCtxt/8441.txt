The TiO2 and POM@TiO2 used in this paper were synthesized by a modified sol–gel method. The Jsc of pure P25 is 15.84 mA cm−2, the Voc is 0.637 V, the FF is 0.564, and the η is 5.69%. The Jsc of the prepared TiO2 is 16.48 mA cm−2, the Voc is 0.68 V, the FF is 0.537 and the η is 6.01%, which is a higher efficiency than that of pure P25, therefore the POMs@TiO2 were directly used in photoanodes without being formed into composites with P25 in this paper. The Jsc of 0.8% Ni4@TiO2 is 18.79 mA cm−2, the Voc is 0.71 V, the FF is 0.595 and the η is 7.94%, which is 32.1% higher than that of the prepared TiO2 based DSSC. 0.8% Co4@TiO2 and 0.8% Ni1@TiO2 modified photoanodes obtained power conversion efficiencies of 6.22% and 6.17%. The electron lifetimes of the self-prepared TiO2 and 0.8% Ni4@TiO2 are 13.5 ms and 28 ms respectively, calculated from a bode plot. Among the three kinds of sandwich-type POMs mentioned in this paper, the 0.8% Ni4 modified photoanode in DSSCs exhibited the best performance in enhancing light harvesting and reducing electron recombination. The energy levels of Ni4 were also investigated.
1. Introduction
Fossil energy, which is consumed commonly in industry and daily life, is a kind of nonrenewable resource, and has resulted in many environmental problems. Exploiting alternative energy resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are attracting increasing public attention. Solar energy is green and can be easily transformed into electric energy by means of solar cells.1 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are an important trend in solar cells on account of their low price, simple manufacturing process and high power conversion efficiency.2 DSSCs have a classical sandwich-type composition that is made up of a dye-sensitized photoanode, mostly composed of a metallic oxide semiconductor, a counter electrode and an electrolyte solution containing a redox pair.3–6 The photoanode plays a vital role in DSSCs, as they can absorb dyes and influence electron transport. When the sensitizer is excited by light, electrons are injected into the conduction band of the semiconductor immediately. During this process, electrons can generally recombine with the dye and electrolyte. A number of efforts have been made to expedite electron transfer and restrain electron recombination.
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are anionic metal–oxygen clusters composed of environment friendly metals and abundant elements,7 which have drawn extensive attention not only due to their fascinating structural features but also their favourable photoelectric chemical properties that have enormous application value in solar energy usage.8,9 Classical types of POMs have been made at different nanoscales and then applied in DSSCs, some of which obtained satisfactory results with regards to enhancing the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs. Their energy band structures were also purposely investigated. Transition metal-substituted POMs can be applied in photoanodes and the electrolyte of DSSCs because they can absorb visible light.10–13
The lacunary POMs have more active sites so they can be used for functionalization. Sandwich-type POMs are a kind of extensively investigated functional POM whose magnetism and catalytic properties have been studied and put into use. In this paper, sandwich-type silicotungstates have been applied in DSSCs for the first time. The preliminary study shows that POMs can not only accelerate electron transmission but also restrain recombination because their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is lower than that of the semiconductor. A sandwich-type germanotungstate has been used in DSSCs, and was used to assemble a co-sensitized solar cell.14,15 It is significant that its electron lifetime is longer than that of pure P25. Furthermore, stable sandwich-type silicotungstates have never been used to modify photoanodes of DSSCs. Here, we applied Ni4, Ni1, and Co4 doped TiO2 in the photoanodes of DSSCs, and we investigated their photochemical properties using current density–voltage curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, surface photovoltage spectroscopy, open-circuit voltage decay curves etc. All three kinds of sandwich-type POM modified DSSCs obtained better power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), of which Ni4 showed the best PCE and the longest electron lifetime. The UV/vis reflection spectrum shows that Ni4 can make up for the UV-light absorption of TiO2 and N719 in the ultraviolet and visible region from 350 nm to 450 nm. The POM@TiO2 nanocomposites, which have different mass concentrations, were made by means of a reformative sol–gel method, and were used directly without being formed into composites with P25. After doping with the sandwich-type POMs, the electron lifetimes of the DSSCs became longer. The electron lifetime of the DSSCs made with 0.8% Ni4@TiO2 and TiO2 is 28.9 ms and 13.5 ms, respectively, which shows an extension of the electron lifetime of more than 10 ms. The electron lifetime of the DSSCs made with 0.8% Ni1@TiO2 and 0.8% Co4@TiO2 is 19.3 ms and 13.3 ms, respectively. The energy levels of Ni4 were obtained using cyclic voltammetry and solid UV curves. The LUMO of Ni4 is −4.19 eV, which is lower than that of TiO2. In the electrode, Ni4 can act as an electron acceptor, which may enhance electron conduction and extend the electron lifetime by retarding recombination.

, Co4 and Ni1 were prepared in accordance with the literature method16 and characterized using FTIR spectroscopy. IR spectra were recorded using KBr pellets on a Bruker AXS TENSOR-27 FTIR spectrometer in the range of 1000–400 cm−1. Thermogravimetric analyses (TG) were performed using Perkin-Elmer TGA7 equipment under a N2 flow at the heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) data were collected using a FEI Quanta 200F microscope handled at a voltage of 20 kV. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the composites were collected using a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in a 2θ range of 5–90° with a step size of 0.02°. A 500 W xenon lamp (CHFXQ500W, Global xenon lamp power) and a double-prism monochromator (Hilger and Watts, D300) provided monochromatic light. The photovoltaic cell has a sandwich-type structure in which ITO is on the top and bottom with the sample inside. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were recorded using a CHI601D Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Corp., China), using a Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a glassy carbon electrode plays the role of working electrode, and a Pt wire works as the counter electrode. Surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) measurements were recorded using a lab-made instrument, which constitutes a source of monochromatic light, a lock-in amplifier (SR830-DSP) with a light chopper (SR540), and a photovoltaic cell. A 500 W xenon lamp (CHFXQ500 W, Global xenon lamp power) and a double-prism monochromator (Hilger and Watts, D300) provide monochromatic light. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a hemispherical analyzer Leybold EA 11. The UV-vis spectra were recorded in the range of 190–800 nm. The fluorescence spectra were recorded using a FL900/FS920 steady-state fluorescence spectrometer.
2.2 Synthesis of POM@TiO2 materials
The as-prepared Ni4 (20 mg) was dispersed in water (5 ml) under stirring to obtain an dark green solution A. 5 ml of titanium isopropoxide was dissolved in 3 ml of n-butanol by stirring to form solution B. The prepared solution A was added dropwise into solution B at the rate of one drop per 10 s to make sure that the TiO2 particles were homogeneous. Afterwards, the suspension was heated and refluxed at 50 °C for 3 h and at 80 °C for approximately 4 h until a hydrogel was synthesized. Next, the product was dried under vacuum conditions at 45 °C for 3 h and 80 °C for 6 h at least. The hydrogel was washed with distilled water 2–3 times, and then it was sintered at 400 °C for 30 min in order to get anatase TiO2.13 Solution A was diluted to give Ni4 solutions with different concentrations. The Co4@TiO2 and Ni1@TiO2 materials were prepared by the same method.17,18
2.3 Preparation of the POM@TiO2 films
The as-prepared POM@TiO2 materials were used to make a paste directly according to the literature method.19 The Ni4@TiO2 powder (0.6 g) and acetic acid (0.1 ml) were ground in a mortar for 5 minutes. Then were ground with water (0.1 ml) for 1 minute five times, ethanol (0.1 ml) for 1 minute fifteen times, and ethanol (0.25 ml) for 1 minute six times. The Ni4@TiO2 paste was transferred to a beaker using 10 ml ethanol. After stirring with a magnetic stirrer bar(1 min) and sonication with an ultrasonic horn (2 seconds work and 2 seconds rest), terpineol (2 g) was added into the beaker, then the mixture was stirred and sonicated again. Ethylcellulose (0.3 g:3 g of 10% solution in ethanol) was added to the beaker and the paste was stirred and sonicated as in the above steps. Through the use of a rotary evaporator to evaporate the ethanol, we can obtain Ni4@TiO2 films finally. Co4@TiO2 and Ni1@TiO2 films were prepared by the same method.
2.4 Solar cell fabrication
FTO conducting glass was successively cleaned with isopropyl alcohol and ethanol inside an ultrasonic cleaner. Firstly, the TiO2 paste, Ni4@TiO2, Co4@TiO2 and Ni1@TiO2 were covered on the clean substrate using screen printing. Then, they were calcined at 400 °C for 30 minutes. Afterwards, the as-prepared films were soaked with a solution which was prepared using 1.1 ml of TiCl4 dissolved in 250 ml of water at 75 °C for 30 minutes and burned at 400 °C for 20 minutes in air. When the temperature was down to 80 °C, the films were put into a 20 ml ethyl alcohol solution in which 5 ml of N719 had been dissolved for 12 h at 25 °C. The films were taken out and washed using a pure ethanol solution to rinse off unanchored dyes and then dried using a N2 current. The dye-adsorbed photoanodes were coated with a Pt sheet, acting as the counter electrode. 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.05 M iodine, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propy-limidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile were added into the electrodes as an electrolyte.
3. Results and discussion
The IR spectra of the synthesized POMs are shown in Fig. S1.† The POM@TiO2 materials were prepared and calcined at 400 °C for 30 minutes in air. Their thermostability can be confirmed by the TG curves. The TG curve of Ni4 gives a 7.1% weight loss in the temperature range of 50–260 °C, which may be due to the loss of all coordinated and non-coordinated water. Ni4, Ni1 and Co4 were stable from 400 °C to 600 °C as shown in Fig. S2,† which indicates that they are not re-solvated after being calcined.
XRD was carried out to investigate that anatase TiO2 was successfully prepared. In light of the XRD peaks, the changes in the TiO2 phase structures were also investigated. They show that in pure TiO2, Ni4@TiO2, Ni1@TiO2 and Co4@TiO2, nine characteristic peaks are observed at 25.4°, 37.9°, 48.2°, 54.2°, 55.1°, 62.8°, 69.0°, 70.1°and 75.4°. This shows that the crystal phase structure of TiO2 was not changed after loading onto the surface of Ni4. Fig. 1 demonstrates the UV-vis absorption spectra of Ni4 and N719. As we all know, TiO2 shows absorption at 387.5 nm and N719 shows absorption at 310 nm according to Fig. 1. Obviously, Ni4 shows absorption in the ultraviolet and visible regions from 350 nm to 450 nm, which can make up for the non-absorption of dye N719 in the visible region.20

Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of P25 and Ni4@TiO2. The synthesized TiO2 has a slightly larger size than P25. After modification with Ni4, the surface became rougher and the size of the particles was about 40–50 nm. The big blocks, compared to pure P25, were observed in the SEM images. Rougher surfaces can absorb dye more easily, so those materials may improve light absorption. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of 0.8% Ni4@TiO2, 0.8% Ni1@TiO2 and 0.8% Co4@TiO2 was used to analyze the chemical environment and the surface composition of Ti, Si, Ni, Co and W atoms as shown in Fig. 3. The energy regions of Ti 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 in pure TiO2 are located at 463.4 and 457.8 eV;21,22 their positions slightly shift after forming composites with POMs. The energy regions of Si 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 in the composites are 102.8 eV and 99.6 eV. The energy regions of Ti 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 in Ni4@TiO2 are 463.5 and 457.9 eV, the energy regions of Ti 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 in Ni1@TiO2 are 463.6 and 457.9 eV, and the energy regions of Ti 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 in Co4@TiO2 are 464.0 and 458.1 eV. The energy regions of W 4f in Ni4@TiO2 are located at 37.5 eV and 35.7 eV, and are in accordance with the WVI oxidation state. The energy regions of W 4f in Ni1@TiO2 and Co4@TiO2 slightly shift as the values of Ti 2p did. The binding energies of Ni 2p in Ni4@TiO2 and Ni1@TiO2 show four peaks at about 883.1 and 873.1 eV in the energy range of Ni 2p1/2, and 862.2 and 857.9 eV in the energy range of Ni 2p3/2, which can be assigned to NiII. The peaks at 796.8 eV in the energy region of Co 2p1/2 and 779.9 eV in the region of Co 2p3/2 are assigned to CoII. These XPS results demonstrate that sandwich-type POMs have been authentically combined with TiO2 in the composite materials instead of only in a physical mixture of POMs and TiO2. The existence of W, Ni and Co can also be confirmed by the EDS analysis in Fig. S5.† The EDS mapping of Si, W, Ni, Ti, and Co indicates that they were distributed uniformly (Fig. S4†).

Surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) is an excellent approach to investigate characteristic parameters of semiconductors under light through noncontact and nondestructive measurements. We can get information not only about the semiconductor interface, surface and overall properties, but also the photogenerated charge transfer and separation behaviors. The SPS spectra of pure TiO2 and Ni4@TiO2 were measured in order to investigate the properties of the composite materials. Fig. 4 displays the SPS spectra of pure TiO2 and 0.8% POM@TiO2. The transition O2p–Ti3d results in a positive peak in the UV region,23 so the spectra of both TiO2 and POM@TiO2 had a peak in the wavelength range of 290 to 380 nm. Photogenerated electrons accumulate on the surface, which can cause a difference in band bending.

The more photogenerated electrons amassed on the surface, the stronger the obtained SPS signal was. In the UV region, the SPS was enhanced after sandwich-type POMs were doped into TiO2. It turned out that the sandwich-type POM@TiO2 has better optical and photovoltaic properties than pure TiO2. The characterization results indicate that Ni4 has helped TiO2 to give the strongest SPS signal among the three kinds of sandwich-type POMs.
The current density–voltage curves for different mass concentrations of Ni4 in the photoanodes were measured in order to investigate the optimized concentration ratio for a higher efficiency.24–26 It has been confirmed that 0.8% Ni4 doped into the photoanode could give the best efficiency from the current density–voltage characteristics. When 0.2% Ni4@TiO2, 0.4% Ni4@TiO2, 0.8% Ni4@TiO2, 1.2% Ni4@TiO2 and 1.6% Ni4@TiO2 composites were applied in DSSCs as the photoanodes, the PCEs of the DSSCs were 6.67%, 6.55%, 7.94%, 6.43%, and 6.07%, respectively. Their Jsc, Voc and FFs are listed in Table 1. The Jsc and Voc of the Ni4 doped photoanodes increased with an increasing content of Ni4, up to 0.8%. When the mass concentration of Ni4 exceeds 0.8%, the Jsc and Voc of the Ni4 doped photoanodes begins to decrease. More effective electron injection and easier transfer may result in the increase of the Jsc, also the restrained charge recombination can increase the Voc. According to Fig. 5a, 0.8% Ni4 doped into the photoanode can give the best efficiency, so we prepared the Co4@TiO2 and Ni1@TiO2 photoanodes using the same content as Ni4. With Co4 and Ni1 doping into TiO2, the performance of the DSSCs was slightly promoted, with power conversion efficiencies of 6.17% and 6.22% respectively as shown in Table 2.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can explain the internal mechanism of DSSCs, which verifies the shift and recombination processes of electrons in DSSCs.27,28 During the EIS test, the device was irradiated by AM 1.5 simulated solar illumination, with a frequency varied from 0.1 Hz to 106 Hz. There are primarily two semicircles in the Nyquist curves as shown in Fig. 6a. The semicircle which appears at a high frequency corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance at the interface of the counter electrode and electrolyte (Rpt) and the semicircle at the lower frequency corresponds to the resistance at the electrolyte–dye-TiO2 interface (Rct). A larger semicircle corresponding to Rct means a better effect on improving charge transfer and suppressing charge recombination. It can be observed that the Rct of Ni4@TiO2 is larger than that of pure TiO2. The results initially prove that Ni4 can have an effect on suppressing charge recombination with dyes or electrolytes. Compared to the characteristic frequency peak of TiO2, the peak of Ni4@TiO2 is obviously slightly shifted to a lower frequency in the bode phase plots; the corresponding frequencies are 5.5 Hz and 11.8 Hz, respectively. The shift of the peaks from high to low frequency suggests a prompt process of electron transport. Furthermore, the electron lifetime of each DSSC is calculated based on the formula: τe = (2πfmax)−1. fmax is the frequency which is obtained from the top of the intermediate-frequency arc.28 The electron lifetimes of 0.8% Ni4@TiO2 and TiO2 are 28.9 ms and 13.5 ms, respectively. The electron lifetimes of 0.8% Ni1@TiO2 and 0.8% Co4@TiO2 are estimated to be 19.3 ms and 18.1 ms by the same formula respectively, which are 42.9% and 34.1% longer than that of TiO2. The electron lifetime of 0.8% Ni4@TiO2 is 1.14 times longer than that of pure TiO2. Obviously, Ni4@TiO2 has a better effect on retarding the recombination of electrons.

Open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) was used to investigate the decay of the open-circuit voltage in the DSSCs by turning off the lighting suddenly. POMs that were studied previously were used as electron acceptors and applied in TiO2 based photovoltaic devices with enhancement of the rate of electron transfer and deferring fast charge-pair recombination.21 As shown in Fig. 7d, the Voc of Ni4@TiO2 decayed more slowly than that of TiO2, illustrating that the charge recombination rate is the smallest. The electron lifetime is estimated by the formula: τ = (kT/e)/(dV/dt)−1, which is shown in the inset of Fig. 7d. The electron lifetime of 0.8% Ni4@TiO2 is 28.9 ms whereas the lifetime of TiO2 is 13.5 ms, which indicates that the DSSC containing 0.8% Ni4@TiO2 has longer electron lifetimes.

(d) The OCVD curves of 0.8% Ni4@TiO2 (red line) and TiO2 (black line). Inset: the electron lifetime of 0.8% Ni4@TiO2 (red line) and TiO2 (black line). 
We investigated the energy levels of Ni4 whose composite materials applied in DSSCs gave the best PCEs and longest electron lifetime using solid diffuse reflection and cyclic voltammetry curve (CV) methods. Because the LUMO of a POM is the combination of d orbitals which are centered on metal atoms, the first reduction applied potential on a CV curve can be used to estimate the LUMO of a POM. From Fig. 7a, the LUMO level of Ni4 is about −0.49 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is equal to −0.31 V vs. NHE and −4.19 eV vs. vacuum. The Eg of Ni4 was obtained from the solid diffuse reflection spectrum. Fig. 7b displays a plot of the K–M function F against energy E of Ni4. The energy axis and the extrapolated line from the linear regime of the absorption edge intersect at one point whose quantitative value is the Eg of Ni4, so the Eg of Ni4 was estimated to be 2.79 eV.
The electron transfer process between Ni4 and TiO2 was investigated using fluorescence emission spectroscopy. In Fig. 7c, Ni4 has a fluorescence emission band at 510 nm, after being formed into a composite with TiO2. The emission of Ni4 with a maximum at 510 nm is efficiently quenched by TiO2. The result proves that the photo-induced electron transfers from Ni4 to TiO2.
The scheme of the photo-induced transfer mechanism is shown in Fig. 8. The CB of TiO2 is higher than the LUMO of Ni4, so the photoelectrons excited from TiO2 can be transferred to Ni4. Ni4 plays the role of electron acceptor, which could accelerate the movement of photoelectrons from TiO2 and also enhance the conductivity of the electrode.29,30 As an electron acceptor, Ni4 may retard electron recombination to extend the electron lifetime.

Conclusions
We synthesized three sandwich-type silicotungstates according to literature procedures, and applied them in the photoanodes of DSSCs for the first time. The POM@TiO2 precursors were used directly in a paste without being composited with P25. The composite photoanodes were fabricated into DSSCs and obtained better photoelectrical properties than TiO2. The investigations indicate that Ni4@TiO2 gave the best power conversion efficiency of the DSSCs. Ni4 played the role of transferring electrons and reducing electron recombination in the DSSCs. Ni4 shows light absorption at 400 nm and Ni4@TiO2 has a larger size than P25, which could promote light scattering and effectively make use of solar energy. The η of 0.8% Ni4@TiO2 is 32.1% higher than that of the prepared TiO2 based DSSC. All the studies demonstrate that the sandwich-type silicotungstate modified TiO2 microspheres may enhance light harvesting and reduce electron recombination in DSSCs. Furthermore, investigations into other types of POMs are in progress.
