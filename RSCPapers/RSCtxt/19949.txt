    , Accepted 19th February 2023First published on 20th February 2023AbstractDue to the differences in atomic arrangement and electronic structures, solid catalysts with different crystal planes have different catalytic properties. Therefore, studying the reaction mechanism on different crystal planes of catalysts at the atomic level is helpful to better understand the structure–activity relationship and improve the activity of catalysts. In this work, the mechanism of reduction of CO2 to formic acid on different surfaces of the Pd3Au alloy is investigated by using density functional theory, and the potential relationship between the difference in the work function and d-band center of the catalyst and the overpotential is revealed. The electronic structure calculation results show that the surface roughness and the electronic structure of the catalyst together determine the catalytic activity of CO2 reduction to formic acid. At the same time, a good linear relationship was found between the surface net charge of the catalyst and the HER activity. The Pd3Au (110) surface with less net surface charge can effectively suppress the HER. The dynamic hydrogen bonding network of water solution is the key to determine the reaction mechanism, which reflects the indispensable role of water molecules in the catalytic reaction and indicates the importance of using an explicit solvent model to simulate solvation effects in the calculation of the reaction mechanism.
1. Introduction
With the continuous improvement of human industrialization, the balance between CO2 emission and consumption has been disrupted, causing a series of environmental problems.1–3 At present, there are two primary strategies to mitigate increasing CO2 emissions. One is to capture carbon dioxide and store it in a stable medium.4–6 The other is to convert CO2 into useful chemicals or fuels, which has attracted increasing research interest in recent years because of its enormous environmental and economic benefits. These include photocatalysis,7–9 thermal catalysis10–12 and electron catalysis,13–15 which are promising methods for converting CO2 into valuable products. Among these methods, electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) has attracted much attention in recent years due to the following advantages.13,16,17 In comparison, the reaction conditions required for electrocatalysis are mild, and the reaction equipment is simple. The implementation of the CO2RR is supplied with electric power from carbon-neutral and intermittent sources (such as solar, wind, geothermal or tidal processes), which is an economic and environmental strategy.
To apply this technology to industry, it is necessary to produce C1/C2 products efficiently. Indeed, this criterion relies on the design of higher-performance electrocatalysts, just like the catalysts of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. Since 1985, the first work by professor Hori,18 which involved electrochemical reduction of CO2 to organic and inorganic products, has been well-known, in which various metal electrodes were used to reduce CO2 into gaseous and soluble products, such as CO, CH4, and HCOO−. Among the expected CO2RR products, formic acid (HCOOH) or formate is highly desirable as a liquid fuel or fuel additive, because it has the highest energy-added value. It can not only be directly used as fuel for formic acid fuel cells, but also be conveniently converted to CO, H2, and CH3OH to meet different applications through simple catalytic reactions. In particular, it is a common hydrogen storage material because it can be easily decomposed into H2.19 Besides, it is also used as a feedstock in industries such as leather, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and rubber.20 The maximum Faraday efficiency (FE) of the electroreduction of CO2 to HCOOH is approximately 100% compared to other C2–C3 chemicals from the electrochemical CO2RR. In general, higher selectivity can effectively reduce the input of extra power and also help reduce the cost of the separation of products. In addition, the HCOOH is usually liquid and has advantages in handling, transportation, and storage. Therefore, the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH may be the process with the greatest potential for large-scale industrialization.
In order to design highly active and selective electrocatalysts, the mechanism of CO2 reduction must be clearly understood. Recent studies have shown that there may be two different pathways for the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH.21–23 In the first way, monodentate formate (COOH* route) is used as an intermediate to form a HCOOH with dissociated hydrogen. The second way is CO2 hydrogenation to form bidentate formate (HCOO* route), and then hydrogenation to form HCOOH. Nørskov et al. analyzed the mechanism of selective production of HCOH on different metal surfaces using DFT calculations.24 The results show that the surfaces of Ag and Pb have stronger binding capacity to COOH* intermediates, which can be further reduced to CO and HCOOH. Meanwhile, the surfaces of Sn, Bi, In and Pb have stronger binding capacity to HCOO* intermediates and can be reduced to form HCOOH. Generally speaking, the Gibbs free energy generated by the H* intermediate on the catalyst surface is used to indicate the possibility of the hydrogen evolution side reaction. Therefore, the formation and adsorption of COOH*, OOCH*, and H* intermediates on the surface of the catalysts should be fully considered in the design of ideal catalysts. However, the formation mechanism of HCOOH cannot be fully confirmed only by calculating the Gibbs free energy and adsorption energy, and further calculation of the kinetic path is needed to obtain more detailed information to determine the mechanism.
Up to now, metal-based catalysts have still been the main catalysts in the process of electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 due to their excellent conductivity, high catalytic activity, and product selectivity. The most commonly used metal catalysts for the synthesis of HCOOH by the CO2RR are Sn, Bi, Cu, and Pd, etc. It is noteworthy that, among many metal materials, palladium is the only one that can achieve the highly selective reduction of CO2 to HCOOH when the overpotential approaches zero.25 Although Pd-based materials can efficiently generate HCOOH in a low overpotential range, CO poisoning often results in the deactivation of the catalyst. E. H. Sargent et al. have elucidated the trend of intermediate binding through DFT calculations to control selectivity and catalytic activity. Pd nanoparticles with abundant high-index surfaces were synthesized reasonably. The current density and Faraday efficiency of the catalyst reached 22 mA cm−2 and 97% at 0.2 V overpotential. The calculation shows that Pd nanoparticles with high index surfaces have appropriate adsorption energy for the OCHO* intermediate, which promotes the catalytic process of CO2 reduction to HCOOH.26 Introducing other metal synthetic alloys into metal materials is an effective strategy for increasing activity. The synergistic effect between different components can adjust the electronic structure of materials, change the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates, and optimize the performance of catalysts. Bai et al. prepared PdSn alloy nanoparticles by a simple wet chemical reduction method.27 The results show that the alloy with a molar ratio of Pd/Sn of 1:1 has the best catalytic activity, and the generation of CO and hydrogen evolution are completely suppressed. In addition, Zhu et al. used electron beam co-deposition to synthesize Au–Pd alloy films, which have stronger activity and selectivity to HCOOH compounds.28
The geometric characteristics of the catalyst greatly affect its CO2RR performance. For body-centered cubic (bcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) metals, the most stable facets are (110) facets and (001) facets.23 Because low surface energy and most transition metal nanoparticles expose low index surfaces, low index surfaces have been a hot topic in catalytic research.29–32 In addition, small nanoparticles (especially clusters) may differ from large particles in that they expose more coordinated unsaturated surfaces at corners and edges.33 It has been reported that exposure to high-index facets and increasing the number of edges, corners, and crystal boundary sites may also improve the activity of the catalyst.34–37 These structures facilitate the adsorption of key reaction intermediates and enhance the local electric field, which ultimately increases the yield of formic acid. In addition, coordination unsaturation may narrow the d-band of the catalysts, resulting in an upward shift of the d-band center and enhancing the adsorption capacity of reaction intermediates.38 Therefore, it is necessary to study the CO2RR mechanism on different index surfaces to understand the catalytic activity and reaction mechanism and to develop new catalysts.
The ability of catalysts to adsorb and desorb specific reaction intermediates determines the reaction path and the required overpotential. Therefore, an in-depth study of the mechanism of the CO2RR will provide valuable information for researchers to design more efficient catalysts. During the formation of formic acid from CO2 reduction, the binding energy of the key intermediate HCOO* to the catalyst correlates with the activity of the catalyst.39 Therefore, it is possible to change the electronic structure of the catalyst by doping40 or synthesizing alloy catalysts41 and further adjust the binding energy of the intermediates to control the selectivity of the reaction and the overall reaction pathway. In this work, we have calculated the mechanism of reducing CO2 to HCOOH on various index surfaces of Pd3Au that include (111), (100), (110) and (211) surfaces. Reaction intermediates and energetics for each elementary step were studied using the DFT calculation method. The onset potential of HCOOH formation on different surfaces was determined, and the relationship between surface properties and catalytic activity was discussed. Based on the calculated reaction energy and activation barrier of each elementary step, the minimum energy path of CO2 reduction to HCOOH on different surfaces of Pd3Au was clarified.
2. Computational method
All calculations were performed within the framework of density functional theory (DFT), as implemented using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).42,43 The energy cutoff for plane wave expansion was set to 400 eV. The convergence criterion for self-consistent iteration was set to 1 × 10−5 eV atom−1 and the systems were fully relaxed until the final force on each atom was less than 0.03 eV Å−1. The projector-augmented wave (PAW) function was used to account for core–valence interactions,44,45 within the exchange–correlation function described by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE).46 The D3 correction of Grimme47,48 was adopted to compensate for the lack of van der Waals interaction description in the GGA functional.
The Pd–Au alloy was constructed by replacing one Pd atom in the corner of an fcc Pd cell with an Au atom, in which the atom ratio of the alloy is Pd:Au = 3:1. The lattice constant of the alloy is 4.028 Å after the optimization of the bulk alloy. Based on the optimized bulk structure, the (111), (110), (100), and (211) surfaces of the Pd3Au structure were then modeled using a four-layer slab, using a (2 × 2) supercell with the top two layers relaxed and the rest fixed to the bulk distances. To avoid the possible interaction between layers, a 15.0 Å vacuum region along the c-axis of a slab model was introduced. The Brillouin zone for geometry optimization of the (111), (110), (100), and (211) surfaces of Pd3Au was sampled with a Gamma-centered k-mesh of 3 × 3 × 1, 3 × 2 × 1, 3 × 4 × 1, and 3 × 2 × 1, respectively. For calculating the density of states, the Gamma-centered k-mesh was increased to 5 × 5 × 1.
Configurations of all possible intermediates were obtained by performing a series of geometry optimizations on various adsorption sites and their adsorption energies of were calculated. Adsorption energy is calculated using the following equation:Eads = Eadsorbate−slab − Eadsorbate − Eslabwhere Eadsorbate−slab, Eslab and Eadsorbate are the total energy of molecules or intermediates adsorbed on the slab surface, bare slabs and gaseous molecules, respectively.
In order to investigate the thermodynamic reaction path, the free energy profiles of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2RR were computed using the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model proposed by Nørskov and co-workers.49 All free energies (ΔG) were calculated using the following equation:ΔG = ΔEDFT + ΔZPE − TΔSwhere ΔEDFT is the energy difference between reactants and products, obtained from DFT calculations; ΔZPE and ΔS are the energy differences in zero-point energy and entropy; T is 298.15 K. The ZPE and S of adsorbates were calculated from vibrational modes obtained within the harmonic oscillator approximation. Vibrational contributions to the entropies for substrates (except for adsorbates) were considered to be inconsequential and counted as zero in the part of TΔS. For molecules, the vibrational contributions to the entropies were calculated from standard thermodynamic tables at 298.15 K and 1 atm. In addition, the implicit solvent model was used for all free energy calculations to consider the influence of the solvation effect, which was realized using the VASPsol program.50,51 The dielectric constant is set to 78.4 to simulate the aqueous solvent environment.
The climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB)52,53 and Dimer methods54,55 were applied to search for transition states with species limited to the surface and the rest of the system was fixed. The systems were fully relaxed until the final force on each atom was less than 0.03 eV Å−1. When searching for the transition state, two explicit H2O molecules are added to the surface of the slab model to consider the solvation effect. In addition, C–H bond formation occurs through the surface H mechanism, in which the hydrogen atoms adsorbed on the catalyst surface are directly bonded with the C atom, while H2O molecules play a role in stabilizing the adsorption intermediates in the process. The formation of O–H was studied through the H-shuttling mechanism. The H2O molecules act as channels to transfer H* (intermediates adsorbed on the surface are denoted by a “*”) from the catalyst surface to the intermediates adsorbed on the surface. Bader charge analysis was used56,57 to observe the behavior of electronic charge transfer in atoms on the outer surface.
Potential-dependent kinetic barriers of all reactions were calculated using the capacitor mode developed by Chan and Nørskov.58,59 These methods are discussed in the ‘potential-dependent kinetic barrier’ of the ESI.† To evaluate the effect of the dynamic H-bond network on the activation energy barrier, the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) with a “slow-growth” method60–62 was used to sample the free energy profile. The details concerning the slab and solvation models, adsorption energies, AIMD simulation, and free energy corrections are provided in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The adsorption properties of various intermediates on different Pd3Au facets
As we all know, owing to the different numbers of dangling bonds on different crystal planes, the activity of metal catalysts varies with the plane index. The optimized structures of different Pd3Au facets are shown in Fig. S1.† In surface science, the coordination number (CN) of the central atom is the number of atoms bonded to it. The average coordination numbers are 9, 8, 7 and 8 for (111), (100), (110), and (211) planes, respectively. At the same time, different index crystal faces have different surface structures at atomic scales. The surfaces of Pd3Au (111) and (110) are relatively flat, while the surfaces of (110) and (211) have a raised atomic structure and a relatively rough surface. In addition, by using a scanning Kelvin probe Xue et al.63 have studied the variation of work functions of metals and alloys with surface roughness. At the micron and nanometer scales, for materials with good chemical stability (such as Cu and Ag), the rough surface induces a lower work function. According to this relationship, we use the work function to quantify surface roughness to describe the structural differences between diverse Pd3Au surfaces. The chemical properties of the Pd3Au alloy are relatively stable; therefore the smaller the work function value is, the rougher the surface is. The work functions of (111), (100), (110), and (211) surfaces calculated using DFT are 5.33, 5.25, 5.16 and 5.18 eV, respectively. Thus, the surface roughness order of the Pd3Au surface is (110) > (211) > (100) > (111), implying that the Pd3Au (110) surface has the highest surface roughness.
In order to explore the chemical properties of different facets, we calculate the electron localization function (ELF) of different crystal planes. An ELF iso-surface value of 0.5 demonstrates that the electron density equals the uniform density of the electron gas. The iso-surface of the electron localization function of different facets is shown in Fig. S2.† ELF iso-surface values on different Pd3Au surfaces are all less than 0.4, showing that electrons are delocalized on the surface. Meanwhile, compared with Pd atoms, Au atoms have a stronger ability to localized electrons around them on different facets.
In addition, the results of deformation charge density indicate that the surface charge distribution of different catalysts has a great difference. As shown in Fig. S3,† the charge on (111) and (211) is mainly distributed on the upper and lower surfaces. The charge of (110) is distributed between the two layers of atoms, and it is worth noting that the charge of (100) is distributed in the layers containing Au atoms. These results were further supported by Bader charge analysis. Furthermore, subtracting the number of valence electrons from the Bader charge of the atom gives the net charge of atoms on the different surfaces, which is listed in Table S1.† The net charges on the top layers of (111), (100), (110) and (211) are 0.361, 1.225, 1.010, and 0.361, respectively. The above results show that the electron distribution on various surfaces is quite different. It is well known that the electronic structure determines the activity and selectivity of the catalysts, so the catalytic activity of high and low index surfaces is also diverse.
Various intermediates adsorbed on different sites on the Pd3Au surface were considered. According to the optimized geometry, the adsorption sites can be classified into three types: top ("T"), bridge ("B"), and hollow ("H") sites, as shown in Fig. S4.† In the process of structure optimization, it is found that the most stable adsorption site for various intermediates on different surfaces is the Pd atom (or including the Pd atom) site. Therefore, only the most stable adsorption structure will be considered in the following discussion. The structures of possible intermediates on each adsorption site were fully optimized as shown in Fig. 1 and adsorption energies and adsorption distance (dslab−adsorbate) between the adsorbate and slab of the most stable intermediates are listed in Table S2.† It can be seen from Fig. 1 that CO2 gas is adsorbed on different index surfaces in parallel, and the smaller adsorption energy and unchanged C–O bond length indicate that CO2 is physically adsorbed on the surface. For the COOH* intermediates, the adsorption sites on different index surfaces are different, but all the adsorbed COOH* structures are trans structures. HCOO* intermediates on different index surfaces have two symmetrically structured O atoms that form Pd–O bonds at the "T" site and one H atom that extends vertically to the vacuum on the surface. Although the modes and sites of adsorption are different, their adsorption energies on various surfaces are very similar. For example, the adsorption energies of COOH* and HCOO* intermediates on the Pd3Au (211) surface are −2.536 and −2.523 eV, respectively. It is worth noting that the absorption energy of HCOO* is the strongest among all intermediates. Furthermore, the adsorption configuration and adsorption sites of HCOOH on different surfaces are diverse. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the adsorption energy of HCOOH on (111), (100), (110), and (211) surface is −0.534, −0.502, −0.581, and −0.674 eV, respectively. It can be seen from the adsorption energy that CO2 and HCOOH are mainly physically adsorbed on different Pd3Au surfaces, while HCOO* and COOH* intermediates are chemically adsorbed, and HCOO* has a stronger interaction with the surface.

 Fig. 2  (a) Adsorption energy and (b) net charge of various intermediates on different surfaces of Pd3Au. 
Interestingly, the adsorption distances between the same intermediates and the different exponents are very similar, but the adsorption energy is very different. Therefore, the net charges of the adsorption intermediates on different index surfaces are calculated by using the Bader charge analysis. The results show that the amount of surface adsorption energy is independent of the charge transfer between the adsorbed intermediates and the surface of the catalyst. However, the type of site where the intermediates adsorb on the surface and the adsorption configuration determine the charge transfer amount of the intermediates. For example, the most stable adsorption sites for COOH* intermediates on surfaces Pd3Au (100) and (211) are "T" sites, with net charges of 0.028 and 0.043, respectively. On Pd3Au (111) and (110) surfaces, the adsorption is most stable at the "B" site, with net charges of 0.196 and 0.127, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the net charges of HCOOH intermediates adsorbed on Pd3Au (111) and (110) surfaces are negative (−0.04 and −0.06). Compared with the adsorption configuration on Pd3Au (211) and (100) surfaces, there is no obvious chemical interaction between the HCOOH intermediate and Pd3Au (111) and (110) surfaces. In addition, it is found that the d-band centers on different surfaces are linearly related to the adsorption energy of CO2 gas (as shown in Fig. S5†), but no significant relationship was found between the d-band centers and the adsorption energy of other intermediates, indicating that the interaction between the intermediates and the catalysts is more complex, and the d-band centers of the materials are still inadequate as descriptors.
3.2 HER and CO2RR selectivity of different surfaces
Under electrocatalytic conditions, the HER competes with each proton-coupled electron transfer step of the CO2RR to reduce the Faraday efficiency of the CO2RR. The Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) of the H atom at the catalytic site on the surface is a widely accepted descriptor for measuring HER activity. Therefore, the HER activities of different Pd3Au facets were calculated based on the CHE model proposed by Nørskov et al. As shown in Fig. 3a, the ΔGH* of Pd3Au (111), (100), (110) and (211) is −0.48 eV, −0.16 eV, −0.22 eV, and −0.37 eV, respectively. We have tried to establish a relationship between the ΔGH* and surface coordinate number, d-band center, surface net charge, and surface work function as shown in Fig. S6,† and found that the surface net charge is a function of ΔGH*. On different Pd3Au surfaces, the HER is gradually suppressed as the net surface charge decreases. The relationship for Pd3Au surfaces between the surface net charge and Gibbs free energy is demonstrated in Fig. 3b. Among them, Pd3Au (110) has the most surface net charge and has the best HER catalytic activity, while the Pd3Au (111) surface with the least surface net charge can effectively inhibit the HER. In addition, we calculated Bader charge,64,65 DDEC6 charge,66–69 and Hirshfeld70 and Hirshfeld-I71 charges to investigate the effect of different kinds of charges on the results. As shown in Fig. S7,† the trend of the results is consistent for different charges. Among them, the DDEC charge results show the best linear relationship with the free energy, while the Hirshfeld and Hirshfeld-I charge results look less than satisfactory. In general, on different Pd3Au surfaces, the HER is gradually suppressed with the decrease in net surface charge.
 Fig. 3  (a) The Gibbs free energy of the HER on different surfaces of Pd3Au. (b) The relationship between the surface net charge and Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*). 
In addition, as shown in Fig. S6(c),† there is a volcano-like relationship between the work function and ΔGH*. The vertex of the volcano is the Pd3Au (110) surface, which has the best HER activity. This result means that the catalytic activity of different surfaces does not simply increase or decrease monotonically with the shift of the work function. Although the amount of data is slightly insufficient, it can be seen that the work function of the surface is a potential catalytic activity descriptor, which will provide new guidance for designing other alloy electrocatalysts. Next, we will discuss in detail the differences in the selectivity and mechanism of electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to formic acid on the four index surfaces of Pd3Au.
It is well known that the possible mechanism for reduction of CO2 to HCOOH depends on the location of the first step of hydrogenation of CO2. One mechanism is the end hydrogenation of the oxygen atom to produce the COOH* intermediate, and the other is the end hydrogenation of the carbon atom to produce the HCOO* intermediate. The two intermediates are further protonated to HCOOH. Thus, the reaction mechanisms of two different intermediates (HCOO* and COOH*) have been calculated to investigate the face dependence of the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH.
As shown in Fig. 4(a), the mechanism of HCOOH formation on diverse surfaces is different. On the Pd3Au (111), (100) and (211) surfaces, the generation of HCOOH through the COOH* intermediate is more advantageous in thermodynamics than that through the HCOO* pathway. However, the HCOO* route is the predominant path for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid on the Pd3Au (110) surface. As can be seen from Fig. S8,† for the Pd3Au (110) surface, it is beneficial for the formation of COOH* intermediates, and the reaction Gibbs free energy is 0.02 eV. However, it is difficult for COOH* intermediates to continue reducing to formic acid, which requires overcoming the 0.59 eV barrier.
 Fig. 4  The energy diagrams of the most favorable routes for different Pd3Au surfaces (a) at the zero-electrode potential and (b) at diverse electrode potential. 
To further explore the catalytic activity of different surfaces, the onset potential (η) for the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH was calculated. When the electrode potential (U) was added, all reactions through COOH* and HCOO* intermediates occurred spontaneously. As shown in Fig. S9,† the onset potential for reactions via HCOO* intermediates are −0.54 V [Pd3Au (111)], −0.64 V [Pd3Au (100)], −0.29 V [Pd3Au (110)] and −0.59 V [Pd3Au (211)], respectively; meanwhile, the onset potential for reactions via COOH* intermediates are −0.40 V [Pd3Au (111)], −0.38 V [Pd3Au (100)], −0.59 V [Pd3Au (110)] and −0.33 V [Pd3Au (211)], respectively. The higher the absolute value of the onset potential, the better the catalytic activity. Comparing the potential values of the two intermediates on different surfaces reveals that the Pd3Au (110) surface has the best activity for HCOO* intermediate reaction paths, followed by the Pd3Au (211) surface with an onset potential of −0.33 V, followed by the Pd3Au (100) surface with an onset potential of −0.38 V, and finally the Pd3Au (100) surface with an onset potential of −0.40 V, as shown in Fig. 4(b).
In addition, the selectivity of the catalyst was further determined by comparing the overpotentials of the HER and CO2RR on different surfaces. The results are shown in Fig. 5, Pd3Au (211) and (111) surfaces can reduce CO2 to HCOOH at lower potentials, while effectively inhibiting the HER. The formation of formic acid on the surface of Pd3Au (110) and (100) requires a relatively higher potential accompanied by the HER. These results indicate that Pd3Au (211) and (111) surfaces have excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid, and that they can also well inhibit the HER.

3.3 Correlation between catalytic activity and surface properties
In order to explore the relationship between the properties and catalytic activity of different surfaces, the relationship between the adsorption energy of HCOO*/COOH* intermediates and overpotential of different surfaces was summarized, as shown in Fig. 6(a). The catalytic activity of the surface is related to the affinity between the intermediate and the surface. The trend of adsorption energy of the two intermediates (COOH* and HCOO*) and overpotential is the same. With an increase in adsorption energy, the overpotential decreases linearly.

For Pd3Au (211) and (110) surfaces which have more atoms with unsaturated coordination, it was found that the adsorption energy of key intermediates on Pd3Au (110) is further enhanced than that on Pd3Au (211), indicating that the catalytic activity is affected by surface roughness. In other words, a rough surface enhances the interaction between the surface and key intermediates compared with a flat surface, which improves the catalytic activity.
To find the possible origin of the difference in catalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH on different Pd3Au surfaces, the densities of states (DOS) projected onto the d-states at the surface of the Pd3Au (111), Pd3Au (100), Pd3Au (110) and Pd3Au (211) slabs were calculated. As shown in Fig. 6(c), the d-band center of the Pd3Au (211) surface is farthest from the Fermi level, while the d-band center of the Pd3Au (110) surface with the same coordinate number is nearest to the Fermi level. There is no direct functional relationship between the shift of the electron energy level of the d orbital and the coordination number, and the position of the d-band center is the inherent property of different surfaces.
As we all know, the catalytic activity of the surface is also closely related to its electronic structure. Therefore, we try to combine the work function with the electronic structure to explore the relationship between the properties of different surfaces and catalytic activity. Interestingly, it is found that the difference between the work function of different surfaces and the d-band center has a well-linear relationship with the overpotential, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Whether formic acid is generated by the reduction of the COOH* or HCOO* intermediate, the overpotential has a good linear relationship with the difference between different surface work functions and the d-band center. This descriptor can also well describe the catalytic activity of the Pd3Au (110) surface with the Pd terminal. The above results show that the surface roughness and electronic structure of the catalyst together determine the catalytic activity of CO2 reduction to formic acid.
3.4 Activation barrier and solvation effects
Thermodynamic calculations show that Pd3Au (211) and (111) surfaces can reduce CO2 to HCOOH via the COOH* route, and can significantly inhibit the HER. To elucidate which route is the most favorable route for the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH on the Pd3Au surface, kinetic energy barriers of the two routes for the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH on different surfaces were calculated. In the calculation process, two explicit H2O molecules were added to the slab model surface to consider the solvation effect. The kinetic barrier of CO2 reduction to HCOOH on different Pd3Au surfaces is shown in Fig. S10.† For Pd3Au (100) and (110) surfaces, the formation of HCOOH through the HCOO* route is kinetically unfavorable. On the Pd3Au (110) surface, the first proton–electron pair transfer process (CO2 reduction to the COOH* or HCOO* intermediate) is the rate-determining step (RDS), and the kinetic energy barriers are 0.80 eV (HCOO* route) and 0.99 eV (COOH* route), respectively. The high kinetic energy barrier shows that the first step of CO2 hydrogenation on the Pd3Au (100) surface is unfavorable. On the Pd3Au (100) surfaces, the rate-determining step of the two routes is different. The rate-determining step of the COOH* route is COOH* + H+ + e → HCOOH and the kinetic energy barrier is 0.47 eV, whereas the rate-determining step of the HCOO* route is , with an energy barrier of 0.64 eV. By comparing the kinetic energy barriers of Pd3Au (100) and (110) surfaces, it is found that the trends of the kinetic and thermodynamic results are consistent.

3.4.1 The influence of the number of explicit water molecules and extra potential. 
It is worth noting that the kinetic minimum energy path of the Pd3Au (111) and (211) surfaces is not the same as the thermodynamically optimal path. There are only two H2O molecules that were concluded in the systems, which may not be enough to describe the solvation effect. Therefore, we try to explain this anomaly by adding more water molecules when searching for transition states. Taking the first step hydrogenation of CO2 on the Pd3Au (111) surface as an example, we calculated the activation energy barriers for the number of water molecules at 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14, respectively. The optimized transition state structures are shown in Fig. S15.† With the increase in the number of water molecules, the interaction between water molecules and surface intermediates gradually increases. As shown in Fig. 7, when the number of water molecules is between 6 and 14, the activation energy barrier of the reaction is the highest (0.81 eV), while when the number of water molecules is 10, the activation energy barrier of the reaction is the lowest (0.71 eV). The difference of 0.1 eV between them indicates that the number of water molecules has little effect on the activation energy barrier. The activation energy barriers are the same when the explicit number of water molecules is 6 and 14, indicating that six water molecules can describe the solvation environment.
 Fig. 7  The energy barrier of CO2 + H+ + e− → COOH* with different water molecules. 
The structures of the initial state, transition state, and final state of all reaction steps of  reduction to HCOOH on Pd3Au (111) are shown in Fig. 8. In the minimum energy pathway of CO2 reduction to HCOOH on Pd3Au (111) and (211) surfaces (as shown in Fig. S11†), the adsorbed  is hydrogenated to generate HCOO* intermediates through the surface “H” mechanism. The hydrogen proton adsorbed on the surface is directly combined with the C atom of the  intermediate, and the explicit H2O molecules play a stabilizing role in this process. Then, the explicit H2O molecule acts as a channel for proton transport, through which the hydrogen proton adsorbed on the surface is transferred to the adsorbed HCOO*, resulting in formic acid. The rate determining step of the Pd3Au (111) surface is HCOO* + H+ + e → HCOOH and the kinetic energy barriers are 0.71 eV. For the Pd3Au (211) surface, the rate determining step is  and the kinetic energy barrier is 0.56 eV. The kinetic minimum energy paths for Pd3Au (111) and (211) surfaces remain inconsistent with the thermodynamic optimal path after adding water molecules.

According to Chan and Nørskov,58,59 as long as there is excess charge on the electrode, the potentials applied would have some effect on the activation energies. Therefore, the energy barriers for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid by COOH* and HCOO* paths were calculated at −0.40 V vs. RHE on the Pd3Au (111) surface and on the Pd3Au (211) surface at −0.33 V vs. RHE, as shown in Fig. S14.† It is obvious that the activation energy barriers of all reactions are reduced under the action of an external potential. However, the overall trend of activation barriers on Pd3Au (111) and (211) has not changed and the kinetic energy barriers of the rate determining steps are reduced to 0.63 eV and 0.27 eV, respectively. Even when a more negative potential was applied, the HCOO* route remained the minimum energy path on Pd3Au (111) and (211), which is still opposite to the thermodynamic results. The above results indicate that even with an increase in the number of explicit water molecules, the static configuration model is still not sufficient to describe the true solvation environment.


3.4.2 The effect of the dynamic network of water. 
It is noted that the method(CI-NEB and Dimer) for evaluating energy barriers based on the static configuration cannot describe the important feature of the dynamic change of the H-bond network of water solvent during the reaction;72 the chemical interaction between the reaction intermediates adsorbed on the catalysts and the surrounding solvent molecules is often ignored. Dynamic multilayer water molecular simulation is helpful to elucidate the properties of a solid–liquid interface and the mechanism of electrocatalysts in aqueous solution.72–74 To evaluate the effect of the dynamic H-bond network on the activation energy barrier, the AIMD was used to sample the free energy profile. The representative snapshots of the HCOOH generation process on the Pd3Au (111) and (211) surfaces are shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. S17,† respectively. It is found that CO2 is chemically adsorbed on the Pd3Au (111) and (211) surfaces, which is different from the results of the implicit solvent model. In all reaction processes, there are multiple hydrogen bonds between intermediate products (COOH* and HCOO*) and solvent water molecules. These results show that H-bonding plays an important role and should be included in the study of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.
 Fig. 9  Representative snapshots of the structural evolution of (a) , (b) COOH* → HCOOH, (c) , and (d) HCOO* → HCOOH on Pd3Au (111). 
The free energy profiles obtained by integration are shown in Fig. S18 and S19.† For the formation of all O–H bonds, H atoms are transferred to CO2 and HCOO* intermediates through H-bond networks. In the transition state, the H atom combines with the neighboring water of the intermediate to form an H3O molecule. On Pd3Au (111) and (211) surfaces, the kinetic energy barrier for the formation of the O–H bond is lower than that of the C–H bond due to the influence of the H-bond network. At the same time, we found that the effect of the H-bond network significantly reduces the energy barrier for the formation of O–H bonds compared with the CI-NEB results. For example, on the Pd3Au (111), the O–H bond formation only needs to overcome energy barriers of 0.22 and 0.26 eV, which are much lower than the energy barriers of 0.71 and 0.64 eV calculated using the static configuration. The calculated kinetic minimum energy path for the surfaces of Pd3Au (111) and (211) is consistent with the trend of the thermodynamic results, and the C–H bond formation (COOH* + H+ + e → HCOOH) is the rate-determining step. In addition, we found that the energy barrier for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid on the surface of Pd3Au (111) was lower than that on the surface of Pd3Au (211), indicating good catalytic activity.
The above result shows that explicit water molecules play a role in stabilizing the structure of intermediates and transferring protons in various reaction mechanisms and are also one of the sources of protons required for reactions. In addition, especially in aqueous solutions, the chemical interaction between the reaction intermediates adsorbed on the catalysts and the surrounding solvent molecules is strong, and the intermediates can form hydrogen bonds with water. The dynamic change of the H-bond network of water solvent during the reaction is the key to determining the reaction mechanism, which reflects the indispensable role of water molecules in the catalytic reaction.

4. Conclusions
In this work, the reaction mechanism of CO2 reduction to HCOOH on Pd3Au (111), (100), (110), and (211) surfaces was investigated by using density functional theory calculations, the nature of the catalytic activity difference between different surfaces was explored, and the necessity of an explicit solvation model in the calculations was revealed. The difference in charge distribution on different surfaces of Pd3Au is one of the reasons for the difference in catalytic activity. Pd3Au (211) and (111) surfaces had good catalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid and could inhibit the HER well. It was found that the surface roughness and electronic structure of the catalyst together determine the catalytic activity. The H-bond network of water solvent is helpful to stabilize the intermediates and promote the transfer of hydrogen from water. It is the key to determining the reaction mechanism and reflects the indispensable role of water molecules in the catalytic reaction. On the whole, this work reveals the catalytic activity of different surfaces of Pd3Au and provides new theoretical guidance for the design of other electrocatalysts.
