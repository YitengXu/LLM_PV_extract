1. Introduction
Graphene is a flat monolayer comprising sp2-bonded carbon atoms tightly packed into a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. Since graphene was first isolated from graphite using sticky tape in 2004, it has attracted tremendous interest from the research community.1–3 Graphene exhibits many extraordinary physical properties, such as an optical transparency of 97.7%,4 a large theoretical specific surface area (approximately 2600 m2 g−1),5 and a high charge carrier mobility (200000 cm2 V−1 s−1) at room temperature.6 These characteristics make graphene a promising candidate for a wide range of applications7 in field-effect transistors,1,8 conductive electrodes for solar cells,9 supercapacitors,10 and lithium-ion batteries.11 These characteristics can be attributed to the fact that graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor and an atomically thin monolayer. However, the lack of a bandgap significantly limits the applicability of graphene in photoenergy conversion, which requires semiconducting materials with a finite bandgap. Graphene oxide (GO) is a form of graphene that contains various oxygen functional groups on the basal plane and sheet edge.12,13 The presence of oxygen functionalities can cause the bandgap to vary according to the degree of oxidation.14 Furthermore, these oxygen functionalities make GO reactive to further chemical modification and/or size modulation, each of which can alter the electronic properties. Appropriate tuning of these properties can render GO media suitable to a wide range of applications associated with photoenergy conversion.
1.1. Electronic structure of graphene-related nanomaterials
An ideal graphene sheet is regarded as an infinitely large aromatic macromolecule without any carbon vacancies.15 The hybrid carbon atom, sp2, forms three strong carbon–carbon σ bonds with three adjacent carbon atoms to form the backbone structure of graphene. The remaining p orbital on each carbon atom overlaps, producing a π-state valence band and a π*-state conduction band. The valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of graphene meet at the Fermi level located on the hexagonal Brillouin zone corners (K and K′ points)16–18 (Fig. 1(a)). The intensity of the overlapping electronic bands, with a linear relationship to low-energy dispersion, renders the electrons in graphene as mass-free charges. This unique electronic structure makes graphene a zero-gap semiconductor or semimetal with high electron mobility and high conductivity.17 The identical environment of the unit cell in the structure of graphene results in zero bandgap.18 Thus, breaking the lateral, in-plane symmetry through chemical doping is the main tactic used for creating a bandgap in graphene. Doping graphene with a variety of functionalities can result in p-doped or n-doped conductivity, according to the shift in the Fermi level caused by the dopant electron affinity (Fig. 1(b)). Alternatively, a bandgap can be generated via quantum confinement effects by tuning the size of the graphene structure.

Oxygen atoms are typically used to disrupt the π network in graphene to open an electronic bandgap. For example, a graphene sheet treated with oxygen plasma exhibits a strong photoluminescence (PL), which indicates that the C–O covalent bonds damaged the original orbitals, resulting in the formation of an energy gap in the graphene.19 In principle, the introduction of a greater quantity of oxygen would enlarge the bandgap. In this case, the VBM would gradually change from the π orbital of graphene to the 2p orbital of oxygen; however, the π* orbital of CBM does not change with an increase in oxygen coverage.14 Engineering the electronic environment of graphene through chemical doping has proven effective in tuning the electronic structure.20,21
GO is a p-doped semiconductor, because electron-withdrawing oxygen functionalities reduce the electron density on graphene.22 Replacing the oxygen functionalities binding to edge sites of GO through the use of electron-donating nitrogen functionalities results in the conversion of GO to an n-doped semiconductor.22 Substitutional doping with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen and boron) as replacements for carbon atoms in the hexagonal honeycomb lattice of graphene also generates n- or p-type conductivity, the effectiveness of which depends on the number of valence electrons associated with the dopant.20,21,23
When the size of a semiconductor crystal is reduced to a scale comparable to the exciton Bohr radius of the bulk material, boundary effects exercise a powerful influence on the energy state distribution of the semiconductor, resulting in the formation of discrete energy levels and a size-dependent bandgap,24–26 which is commonly referred to as the quantum confinement effect. The zero effective mass of charges in graphene induces an infinite exciton Bohr radius, such that the quantum confinement effect is apparent in graphene structures of any finite size.27 For example, quantum dots (QDs) of less than 100 nm can be produced by cutting graphene sheets into sections using electron beam lithography. These QDs exhibit intrinsic quantum confinement electronic states, such that graphene sheets of only a few nanometers in width present a confinement gap of up to 0.5 eV.28 According to the density functional theory (DFT), adjusting the size of graphene from bulk to an aromatic ring could alter its bandgap from 0 to 7 eV.29 The bandgap can also be tuned by modifying the surface chemistry of graphene QDs.30–32 Functional groups (e.g., methyl groups and amino groups) can be used to alter the electronic structure of QDs.31,32
1.2. Electronic structure modulation of GO nanomaterials
Researchers have developed numerous methods to alter the semiconducting properties associated with the graphene architecture.20,33 The edges and basal plane of graphene differ in their reactivity to surface functionalization. Dangling bonds make the edge sites of graphene more reactive to bonding with a variety of chemical moieties (e.g., hydrogen and oxygen atoms).34,35 Compared to edge functionalization, modifying the basal plane of graphene is relatively difficult, because of the strong covalent bonding of sp2 hybrid carbon atoms.
GO derived through the solution oxidation of graphite using strong oxidizing reagents (e.g., H2SO4 and KMnO4)36 has shown considerable promise. The chemical properties of the graphene surfaces can be tuned according to a wide range of applications, because of the presence of several types of oxygen functional groups (e.g., carbonyl and carboxyl groups on the edge, and epoxy and hydroxyl groups on the basal plane). Oxygen functional groups forming sp3 hybrid orbitals on carbon atoms provide reactive defect sites, which makes it possible to use GO for surface modification, substitutional doping, and size modulation.37,38 The defects inherent in GO present numerous possibilities for the further tuning of electronic and optical properties, thereby extending the application of graphene to PL and photocatalysis.
The following methods have been developed for the synthesis of graphene materials with a finite bandgap: (1) top-down routes including chemical oxidation,36 chemical and thermal reduction,29 photothermal reduction,39 electron beam lithography,28 hydrothermal methods,40 solvothermal methods,41 microwave-assisted methods,42 sonication-assisted methods,43 and electrochemical methods;44 and (2) bottom-up routes including stepwise solution chemistry45 and precursor pyrolysis.46,47 With the exception of semiconducting graphene prepared by electron beam lithography, all of the resulting semiconducting graphene materials contain oxygen functionalities. Unlike graphene, GO provides a basic framework for the development of materials with semiconducting properties. The tunable electronic properties of GO-based materials have led to widespread research into their applicability as a medium for photoenergy conversion. The results of these efforts can be found in a number of comprehensive reviews.38,48,49
In the current review, we focus on the underlying mechanisms involved in PL and photocatalysis for a wide variety of GO nanoparticles. We seek to provide an inspirational perspective on future developments in this field. It is our hope that this review offers valuable insights into GO nanoparticles to further expand their applicability.
2. PL of GO nanostructures
The heterogeneous atomic and electronic structure of GO means that fluorescence in GO must be due to charge recombination in localized states rather than from band-to-band transitions, as is the case for typical semiconductors. Considerable effort has gone into investigating PL emissions associated with size effects, edge effects, emissive centers, surface functionalities, and electronic structures; however, the precise mechanisms responsible for the various PL wavelengths and degrees of quantum efficiency have yet to be elucidated. In this section, we summarize what is known regarding the mechanisms involved in PL emissions from GO, reduced GO (rGO), chemically doped GO, graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs), surface functionalized GOQDs, and substitutionally doped GOQDs.
2.1. PL emissions of GO sheets

2.1.1. PL emissions of as-synthesized GO. 
2.1.1.1. Basic PL emissions of GO. 
Theoretical predictions have been posited regarding the occurrence of a bandgap in GO sheets;14 however, no evidence of fluorescence has been reported. Intrinsic PL from GO was first observed by Sun et al.50 In that study, samples with two lateral dimensions (10–300 nm and 1–5 nm) exhibited broad PL emissions in the visible near-infrared (NIR) range. In a suspension of large GO particles, PL emissions were observed at 570 nm following excitation at 400 nm. In a suspension of small GO particles, the maximum emissions shifted to 520 nm. This blue shift in the peak emissions was attributed to differences in the lateral dimensions of GO. Sun et al. further separated the GO sheets by physical size and used various fractions to investigate size-dependent PL emissions. Nonetheless, similar emission behaviors were observed, resulting from the similar aromatic domains of the GO sheets. The inhomogeneous nature of the aromatic domains, ranging from small to large, was responsible for fluorescence in the visible and NIR regions, respectively.
Luo et al. reported comparable fluorescence properties in liquid GO (l-GO) and solid GO (s-GO) that was obtained by drop-casting a concentrated GO solution.51 The PL emissions of l-GO appeared in the visible region with long infrared emission tails, and were similar to those of s-GO. However, s-GO produced more PL spectral weight in the infrared region. The isolated GO plane of l-GO confined the diffusion of free carriers or bound excitons. The layers of GO in s-GO gave rise to additional interflake relaxation pathways, which resulted in a red-shifted emission spectrum. Thus, the intrinsic PL emissions of GO can be obtained from the individual layers of a l-GO dispersion.
2.1.1.2. Roles of oxygen functionalities in PL emissions of GO. 
The binding of sp3-hybrid carbon atoms in graphene to plentiful oxygen functional groups creates a bandgap in GO sheets.52 Graphene comprising connected sp2-hybrid carbon atoms acts as a conductor, whereas fully oxidized GO is an insulator. GO is essentially a mixture of sp2 and sp3 carbon atoms (i.e., small sp2 domains isolated within a sp3 carbon matrix52), which is a hybrid material with a tunable electronic structure. Adjusting the ratio of sp3 to sp2 carbon atoms is an effective means of tuning the bandgap of GO, thereby modulating GO from an insulator to a semiconductor.53 The resulting PL emissions appear in the visible to NIR regions.19,54,55
The mechanism involved in the participation of the sp2 domain in PL emissions remains to be elucidated. One popular approach to creating dominant sp2 domains involves the reduction of GO to restore conjugated π domains. Researchers have made considerable efforts to enlarge sp2 domains through chemical reduction,29,51,56,57 thermal reduction,54,57,58 microwave reduction,59 and photoreduction.39,60,61
Treating pristine graphene with O2 plasma is a direct method of observing the PL emissions of GO. Gokus et al. exposed single-layer graphene (SLG), obtained from microcleavages of graphite, to O2 plasma for periods of increasing duration.19Fig. 2(a) presents the bright, localized emissions obtained after short treatment times (see also position 1 in Fig. 2(b)). Following a longer exposure, the PL emissions were stronger and showed spatial homogeneity (position 2 in Fig. 2(b), i.e., the bright area excluding positions 1 and 3). Fig. 2(c) presents the PL spectroscopic results, showing the broad-band PL spectra detected at the positions marked in Fig. 2(b). Decreasing the size of sp2 islands by extending the oxidation time resulted in slightly enhanced PL emissions (positions 1 and 2 in Fig. 2(c)). In position 3 of Fig. 2(b), PL was intentionally bleached using intense laser irradiation, which led to a blue shift in the maximum PL and a reduction in PL intensity, compared with the emissions in positions 1 and 2. Thus, Gokus et al. attributed the observed PL to C–O bond related localized electronic states at the oxidation sites, rather than to the quantum-confined sp2 islands.

The multilayer graphene with the O2 plasma treatment remained nonluminescent because the subjacent untreated layers quenched emissions from the topmost oxygen-treated layer. Nourbakhsh et al. developed a two-step O2 plasma treatment method for fluorescent bilayer graphene (BLG).62Fig. 2(d) presents an optical picture of a pristine graphene flake, comprising two SLG regions, two BLG areas, and an area of few-layer graphene (FLG). No emissions were detected in the thicker graphene samples; however, the O2 plasma treatment made the SLG emissive (Fig. 2(e)). The graphene flakes in Fig. 2(f) revealed bright PL emissions from the BLG regions because of the extended O2 treatment, whereas the SLG areas were etched and the FLG areas remained invisible because of the large thickness. Fig. 2(d)–(f) indicate that the oxygen progressively rendered the graphene layers photoluminescent.
Galande et al. reported molecular-like fluorescence from GO that is spectrally structured, strongly pH-dependent, and completely reversible with a pH value change.55 A comparison of the emission and excitation spectra in cases with different pH conditions indicated the existence of more than one fluorophore on GO. The oxygen functionalities (e.g., COOH, C–OH, CO) on GO behaved as fluorophores. COOH exhibits two reversible formulae: COOH in acidic conditions and COO− in basic conditions. Relatively sharp emissions and excitation features appeared under basic conditions, whereas acidic conditions resulted in protonation and a broad and strongly red-shifted emission spectrum. These phenomena could be attributed to the electronic coupling of COOH groups with GO sheets, resulting in the formation of quasimolecular fluorophores similar to polycyclic aromatic compounds. This appears to be at the very nature of GO fluorescence.
The type of oxygen functionalities on GO sheets has a pronounced influence on PL emissions.63,64 Li et al. treated GO sheets with KOH and HNO3 to alter the oxygen-containing functional groups and determine their effects on PL emissions.63 Following the KOH treatment, the COOH and CO groups were reduced to C–OH groups, and the C–O–C groups were converted to C–OH groups. Following the HNO3 treatment, the COOH and CO groups significantly increased with a decrease in C–O–C and C–OH groups. Fig. 3 presents the PL spectra of GO and KOH- and HNO3-treated GO sheets under excitation at a wavelength of 420 nm, which exhibited three distinct PL emission peaks.

Four types of electronic transitions between antibonding and bonding molecular orbitals for organic materials can be used to interpret the PL spectra of GO (Fig. 3):63 (1) the σ*→σ electronic transition occurring in alkanes that have no n (nonbonding state) or π electrons; (2) the σ* → n transition occurring in alcohols, amines, and ethers; (3) the π* → π transition occurring in aromatic molecules; and (4) the π* → n transition typically occurring in ketones. The energy gaps of these electronic transitions vary from the largest σ* → σ electronic transition to the smallest π* → n transition, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. Compared with the surface oxygen functionalities on treated GO sheets, the three PL bands corresponded to σ* → n, π* → π, and π* → n transitions, which were in turn associated with the C–OH, aromatic CC, and CO groups, respectively. These results show that the fluorescence of GO varied according to the proportion of oxidized groups. In the following section, we directly discuss the role of the three functional groups in PL emissions.
2.1.1.3. Time-resolved spectroscopy in conjunction with theoretical calculations. 
Shang et al. used steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques in conjunction with calculations based on the DFT to study the fluorescence of GO in water.65 Steady-state measurements revealed the correlation between excitation and emission spectra. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements presented multiexponential kinetic decay, which was ascribed to the emission state associated with the band edges and localized electronic states. These behaviors were indicative of multiple fluorophore systems with aromatic and oxidation groups. The related electronic structures were calculated according to the DFT. Fig. 4(a) presents top and side views of the theoretical atomic structure of GO cells comprising CC, C–O, CO, and OC–OH. According to the electronic band structure and density of states in Fig. 4(b), the bandgap of the GO structure in this sample was 0.6 eV, caused by a nonoxidized CC region (approximately 3 nm-sized sp2 domain). The three lowest conduction bands contained five localized states (red spots), which confined excited electrons within the momentum space. These confined electrons relax radiatively rather than nonradiatively. In the dominant yellow (500–800 nm) fluorescence of GO, the permissible electronic transitions are not from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (0.6 eV), but rather from higher excited states to the HOMO, or from the LUMO to lower levels in the valence band (Fig. 4(c)). Fig. 4(d) presents the calculated orbital energy levels of the structures shown in Fig. 4(e) and the corresponding electronic orbitals resulting from CC, C–O, CO, and OC–OH. According to steady-state measurements, the visible fluorescence of GO can be ascribed to the electron–hole recombination from the LUMO to H1-5 and from L+1 and L+2 to the HOMO. These results indicate that the fluorescence was caused mainly by electronic transitions between nonoxidized CC and the boundary of the oxidized regions.

Nonlinear properties and carrier dynamics are key to determining the mechanisms underlying the optoelectronic properties of GO.66–69 Liu et al. prepared three types of GO with different degrees of oxidation: (1) single-layered graphene oxide (SGO) with sufficient oxidation on the basal plane; (2) few-layered graphene oxide with less than adequate oxidation on the basal plane (FGO1); and (3) few-layered graphene oxide with less than adequate oxidation at the edges (FGO2).69 Panels (a), (c), and (e) of Fig. 5 present the transient differential transmission spectra of these GO samples at a low pump intensity, using degenerate pump-probe (800 nm) spectroscopy to ensure ultrafast dynamics. Long-term decay in SGO and FGO1 was associated with the confinement of sp2 clusters. The optical transmittance values were as follows: FGO2 (11%), FGO1 (46%), and SGO (82%), which indicates an increase in sp3 domains associated with an increase in bandgap. Panels (b), (d), and (f) present the measured transient responses of SGO, FGO1, and FGO2 under a high pump intensity. The ultrafast dynamics of FGO2 helped to ensure rapid relaxation. The differential transmission spectra of SGO and FGO1 resulted in negative signals, which are an indication of nonlinear absorption. Fig. 5(g) presents a model of the transient response associated with photo-induced dynamics localized in sp2 clusters and sp3 domains. The negative transient absorption signals were due to two-photon absorption in the sp3 regions, whereas the positive signals were due to saturable absorption in the sp2 regions. Clearly, manipulating the fractions of the sp2 and sp3 domains presents possibilities for engineering the linear and nonlinear optical properties of GO.

The insets of parts (a), (c), and (e) are schematics of the structural morphology of SGO, FGO1, and FGO2, where the gray and white regions represent the sp2 domains and sp3 domains, respectively. In the insets of (b) and (d), the differential transmission curves are magnified around zero delays. The solid lines are fits based on the model described in the text, which includes both sp2 and sp3 domain contributions to the optical response. (g) Schematic drawing of the transient absorption in the sp2 and sp3 domains. SA is saturable absorption and TPA is two-photon absorption. The incident excitation induces a positive transient differential transmission in the sp2 domains because of SA, and a negative transient differential transmission in the sp3 domains because of TPA. The insets are the bandgap structures of the sp2 (left) and sp3 domains (right). The bottom shows that the combination of the transient differential transmissions corresponds to the sp2 and sp3 domains, respectively. Reproduced with permission from ref. 69.

2.1.2. PL emissions of rGO prepared using chemical reduction. 
The use of hydrazine and galactose for the reduction of GO sheets resulted in a blue shift in PL emissions.29,51,56,57 Eda et al. carefully controlled the concentration of isolated sp2 domains on GO thin films, deposited from a thoroughly exfoliated GO suspension, by exposure to hydrazine vapor for reduction.29 The GO (and rGO) contained in the thin films and solutions exhibited PL emissions ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to blue, which differed markedly from the red to NIR PL emissions reported in previous studies.14,51,54,55 This is due to differences in the native structure of GO. The size of the sp2 domains determines the local energy gap and therefore the wavelength of the emitted fluorescence. Fig. 6(a) illustrates the variance in bandgap across a range of sp2 domain sizes (a single benzene ring is approximately 7 eV, a sp2 domain of 20 aromatic rings is approximately 2 eV), calculated according to the time-dependent DFT. Emissions in the UV-visible region can occur in sp2 clusters of less than 1 nm of approximately 20 aromatic rings. Larger sp2 domains (>2 nm) have smaller bandgaps, which produce red to NIR emissions. This calculation is regarded as simplistic, because it fails to take into account the influences of the surrounding sp3 matrix. This and other calculation methods with various functionalities are reviewed in Section 2.1.4.
 Fig. 6  (a) Energy gap of p–p* transitions calculated according to DFT as a function of the number of fused aromatic rings (N). The inset shows the structures of the graphene molecules used for the calculation. Parts (b–d) depict the structural models of GO at different stages of reduction. The larger sp2 clusters of aromatic rings are not drawn to scale. The smaller sp2 domains indicated by jagged lines do not necessarily correspond to any specific structure (for example, olefinic chains) but rather to small and localized sp2 configurations that act as luminescence centers. The PL intensity is relatively weak for (b) as-synthesized GO but increases with reduction because of (c) the formation of additional small sp2 domains between the larger clusters caused by the evolution of oxygen with reduction. After extensive reduction, the smaller sp2 domains created (d) percolating pathways among the larger clusters. (e) Representative band structure of GO. The energy levels are quantized with a large energy gap for small fragments caused by confinement. A photogenerated e–h pair recombining radiatively is depicted.

The weak PL intensity of GO films can be increased dramatically by even a short exposure to hydrazine vapor; however, extended exposure can actually quench the PL signal. Fig. 6(b)–(d) present a schematic representation of the GO structures in various stages of reduction. The GO sheet in Fig. 6(b) contains sp2 domains of approximately 3 nm and less dispersed in an sp3 matrix (grey dots represent sp3 carbon atoms). Fig. 6(c) illustrates the evolution of smaller sp2 domains resulting from the removal of oxygen through reduction. Further removal of oxygen from the rGO sheet led to percolation between the large sp2 clusters via the growth of smaller sp2 domains (Fig. 6(d)). It is clear that longer reduction times caused subjacent sp2 clusters to quench emissions by hopping from smaller sp2 domains. The band diagram corollary of the physical images in Fig. 6(b) and (c) is presented in Fig. 6(e). The presence of isolated sp2 domains led to the localization of electron and hole pairs, which facilitated radiative recombination in small sp2 domains, resulting in an enhancement in PL intensity. These results indicate that the PL emissions of GO can be attributed to the emissions from sp2-domain centers.


2.1.3. PL emissions of rGO prepared using photothermal reduction. 
Compared with chemical and thermal reductions, the milder photothermal treatment allows for a more gradual transition from GO to rGO. Chien et al. subjected a GO aqueous solution to 500 W Xe lamp irradiation for various exposure durations of up to 3 hours.39 The as-prepared GO presented PL over a broad range of 400 to 800 nm. The PL peaks gradually moved towards shorter wavelengths, as a function of exposure time (Fig. 7(a)). The color of the PL emissions changed from yellow-red in the GO solution to blue in the rGO solution (Fig. 7(b)). As a result, the PL spectra of the GO and rGO suspensions (following a reduction of 0–180 min) were deconvoluted into two peaks centered at 600 and 470 nm, corresponding to red and blue emissions, respectively (as shown in Fig. 7(c)–(e)). Fig. 7(f) summarizes the mechanisms involved in the evolution of PL emissions from GO and rGO. The predominant red emission band in GO was caused by a wide range of disorder-induced defect states within the π–π* gap (Fig. 7(f)). Following reduction, the number of disorder-induced states decreased and was replaced by small, new, isolated sp2 domains. The charge recombination among these sp2 domain-like states emitted blue fluorescence.

Measurements obtained from ultrafast (femtosecond or picosecond) time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements are commonly used to study the carrier dynamics in GO to reveal the electronic structure.60,61,69 Exarhos et al. suggested that the disorder of in-plane states in the oxidation profile establishes a spatially varying bandgap, which results in a broadband emission and a nearly continuous distribution of emission states within the ground and excited states.60 The dynamics of picosecond TRPL spectra can be used to investigate the sequence of relaxation events in a disordered band model, in which carriers relax from an excited state to the minima of the disordered band. A number of carriers recombine to produce blue emissions, whereas others migrate to lower minima via tunneling to produce red emissions. Following photoreduction, the proliferated graphene-like sp2 domains act as PL recombination sites, which confine electron–hole pairs to blue emissions and curtail the spectral migration that would otherwise result in red emissions.
Wang et al. provided a similar model to explain the existence of quantum-confined sp2 domains within an sp3 matrix, the features of which were unraveled via selective excitation of GO and photothermally treated rGO using experiments based on femtosecond time-resolved broadband transient absorption.61 Two unique bleaching peaks in absorption reveal with excitation wavelengths for GO. The use of a light pump at 400–480 nm (blue side) caused the generated carriers to fall into lower-energy sp2 domains with a bandgap of 2.58 eV (480 nm). Following excitation at 510–650 nm (red side), the location of the bleaching peaks was almost the same as that of the excitation wavelength, which is similar to the band–edge transitions observed in typical semiconductors. In rGO, the bleaching peak on the blue side was enhanced, but the bleaching peak on the red side was reduced, indicating that sp2 domains were produced to bleach the blue absorption and oxygenated sites were diminished to suppress the red absorption.


2.1.4. PL emissions of surface-doped GO. 
Previous discussion in this section outlined the efforts to identify the PL mechanisms of GO sheets with and without reduction, as measured using steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques in conjunction with DFT calculations. Upon closer examination, the mechanisms underlying PL emissions in GO sheets can be classified into two categories. One is based on the intrinsic state emission, corresponding to sp2 domains with a size effect. The other is the defect state emission, associated with the sp3 matrix or sp3 carbon atoms in the vicinity of sp2 domains. In many cases, these two mechanisms are correlated because sp2 domains can be induced by manipulating the defects in GO. The various approaches used for tuning the surface chemistry of GO can be classified as surface-transfer doping or substitutional doping.
2.1.4.1. Surface-transfer doping of GO. 
(A) Oxygen-rich functionalization. 
According to DFT calculations, oxygen functional groups, including C–O, CO, and OC–OH, create various electronic structures on GO that are capable of generating PL emissions.54,55,61 Tailoring the proportions of the functional groups and understanding their effect on the overall structure is key in promoting PL. Kumar et al. employed atomistic simulations in conjunction with DFT calculations to study GO structures possessing a wide range of chemical compositions. They also investigated the effect of individual functional groups (such as epoxy, hydroxyl, and carbonyl) on work function, electronic structure, and PL.70 Using oxygen concentrations of 10–20%, the work function was shown to be tunable to within 0.5 eV between 5.0 and 5.5 eV, simply by adjusting the reduction conditions. These findings indicate that the blue shift in the PL emission of rGO is due to the quantum confinement of sp2 domains.
The oxygen concentration is not the main variable controlling the work function. Excellent work function modulation can be obtained by varying the types of functional groups. In GO, the PL emission is governed by π and π* bands, resulting from carbon pz states. Kumar et al. demonstrated that in GO ribbons, valence band states (π band) are localized mainly at epoxy groups, whereas most conduction band states (π* band) are contributed by carbonyl groups.70 Hydroxyl groups have a relatively low influence on the PL emissions of GO; therefore, varying the ratio of epoxy and carbonyl groups to control the π and π* bands is an effective strategy for tuning PL emissions.70,71 The covalent connection of fluorine to GO can also be used to alter the electronic structure, resulting in a tunable bandgap.72–74
Gan et al. reduced GO via solvothermal methods in a variety of environments that contained the precursors required for the simultaneous functionalization of the corresponding chemical groups.58,75 Varieties of functionalized rGO were developed to control PL behavior in rGO and elucidate plausible mechanisms for enhancing PL emissions. Similar to the PL spectra of rGO published in other studies, broadband PL can be divided into two peaks, corresponding to the blue and red emissions; however, the intensity of red emissions is enhanced by functionalization. Blue emissions are excitation independent, whereas red emissions are excitation dependent.

Fig. 8 presents a schematic diagram of the mechanisms involved in rGO and functionalized rGO. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the short-wavelength excitation (ExA) in rGO induced PL emissions in two parts. One part was the blue emission (EmA) caused by topological defects (carbon-related defect states) associated with stable pentagonal rings. The other was the accepted excitation-dependent (ExC) emission (EmB), which is essentially a size effect of sp2 domains (Fig. 8(a)). In the functionalized rGO shown in Fig. 8(b), a new category of excitation (ExB) is provided by the grafted groups, in which resonant energy transfer occurs between the newly formed energy level and the sp2 domain level, which enhances size-dependent emissions. The red emissions of rGO and GO are associated with oxygen-related structures and the size effect of sp2 domains.
 Fig. 8  Schematic illustration of the PL emission mechanism. The emission is composed of two parts, the defect state (left side) and the localized energy levels caused by the size effect of sp2 clusters (right side). (a) For rGO, the blue emission from the defect state is predominant (wide arrow). (b) For functionalized rGO, an explanation for the enhanced PL is presented. A new excitation process appears and the excitation of sp2 clusters themselves is improved by resonant energy transfer. Reproduced with permission from ref. 58. Copyright 2013 Wiley-VCH. 
(B) Organic functionalization. 
The PL intensity of GO sheets is weak. Despite a slight improvement in PL intensity following moderate reduction, the quantum yield (QY) is too low to be measured accurately. In previous sections, we focused on reviewing the PL mechanisms of GO. However, the PL intensity and peak position are sensitive to differences in the functionalization of GO sheets. The emission peak of PEGylated GO is blue-shifted, compared to the PL emission peak of GO.50 Mei et al. modified GO using alkylamines via nucleophilic reactions with epoxy and carboxyl groups, both of which generally induced a nonradiative recombination of localized electron–hole pairs leading to nonemissivity in GO.76 Functionalized GO exhibited a maximum QY of up to 13% (0.02% for original GO sheets), because of the removal of nonemissive oxygen functionalities via surface passivation.
2.1.4.2. Substitutional doping of GO. 
Additional energy is required to drive substitutional doping processes, to account for the high binding energy of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms. This results in the reduction of GO sheets.77 Oxygen functionalities on GO sheets also play a major role as catalyzing agents, which increase the content of heteroatoms and thereby reduce energy consumption in reactions.78 Considerable effort has gone into the nitrogen doping of rGO sheets via annealing,78–81 photochemical doping,82 and the application of plasma83,84 under ammonia conditions, to enhance PL emissions and reveal the underlying mechanisms.
Substitutional nitrogen-doped rGO (N-rGO) generally has three nitrogen configurations: pyridine-N, pyrrolic-N, and quaternary-N. PL emissions in the UV region can be quenched by doping rGO with pyridine-N; however, quaternary-N enhances the overall PL intensity.78–81 Liu et al. synthesized N-rGO using a photochemical route, resulting in the formation of the three aforementioned nitrogen functionalities, as well as an amino-like form of N. These results can be attributed to the mild conditions involved in the process, compared to those associated with annealing.82 The PL intensity of GO can be significantly enhanced with a high enhancement ratio (N-rGO/GO) of approximately 1501.57%, which is attributed to the amino-like N formation. The result is much higher than that of N-rGO obtained by annealing in NH3.80 Annealing can be used to replace the amino-like N on N-rGO with fluorine functionalities to increase PL intensity in the UV region,81 following a mechanism similar to that found in Fujii and Enoki.86
Chiou et al. elucidated the effects of nitrogen on the enhancement of PL emissions in graphene oxide nanoflakes (GONFs).83 Nitrogen-doped GONFs were synthesized using nitrogen plasma and a K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) was used to probe the density of states for unoccupied orbitals. Characteristic features of π* and σ* (typical of unsaturated CC bonds and C–C bonds, respectively) were observed in the XANES spectra. Additional π* and σ* features associated with the N- and O-related bonds were obvious in nitrogen-doped GONFs. Fig. 9 presents a plausible mechanism to explain PL in nitrogen-doped GONFs, involving the resonant transfer of energy from N and O atoms to sp2 domains. When nitrogen-doped GONFs are excited with suitable photon energy, the core electrons from both N 1s and O 1s states are excited to unoccupied 2p states belonging to the π* states. The electrons then fall into π states or substitution-induced localized states in the region of π or in the π*–π gap, whereupon the energy is released in the form of EPL, such that PL intensity is enhanced. Chiou et al. demonstrated that N and O atoms possess two functions: (1) activating luminescence centers; and (2) enhancing PL emission by transferring electrons from N and O atoms to sp2 domains.

2.2. PL emissions of GOQDs
GOQDs are tiny pieces of graphene decorated with oxygen functional groups. Dots of less than 100 nm (lateral dimensions) are applied in single, double, and multiple (3 to 10) layers.28 The intrinsic electronic and optical properties observed in GOQDs are inherited from GO. The redundant sp3 matrix and PL quenching caused by carrier hopping between sp2 domains of various sizes are abandoned in the discussion of GOQDs; in return, a strong PL emission occurs. A number of strategies have been devised for size modulation (including top-down and bottom-up methods) and the tuning of the surface chemistry (including oxidation level tuning, surface-transfer doping, and substitutional doping) with the aim of engineering the electronic structure of GOQDs.

2.2.1. PL emissions of GOQDs prepared using top-down methods. 
Top-down routes refer to the cutting of graphene sheets into QDs by using physical28 or chemical84 methods. Chemical routes are most commonly employed because of their large-scale applicability. When using chemical methods, the existence of defects is required to mediate the formation of QDs, which means that the graphene must be oxidized before it is cut into small sheets.

Fig. 10 presents the most common strategy for cutting GO into GOQDs, in which oxygen-containing functional groups (such as epoxy groups) are used to create defects on GO sheets to serve as reactive sites. Theoretical calculations indicate that epoxy groups should form a line on a carbon lattice.85–87 Cooperative alignment induces a rupture in the underlying C–C bonds after providing additional energy. Once a C–C bond breaks, the epoxy groups energetically prefer to convert to more stable carbonyl groups bonding at the edges of the GOQDs. This makes it possible to synthesize GOQDs from any carbon materials comprising aromatic sp2 domains.40,88–90 Hydrothermal, solvothermal, acidic oxidization, electrochemical, microwave-assisted, and ultrasonic cutting are the various cutting methods used to unleash the energy of the C–C bond. PL emission properties vary according to the synthesis route for the fabrication of GOQDs (Table 1).

2.2.1.1. Hydrothermal cutting. 
Hydrothermal cutting is a simple method for cutting GO into GOQDs. This method is usually conducted under basic conditions, which helps avoid aggregation from the reduction of GOQDs during hydrothermal processes. Pan et al. first proposed the hydrothermal synthesis method for the fabrication of GOQDs. Their method employed graphene sheets as the starting material, prepared from a thermal reduction of GO (300 °C).40 The graphene sheets were oxidized in concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4, resulting in the formation of epoxy groups that tended to form a line along the carbon lattice. This was followed by a hydrothermal treatment (200 °C) under alkaline (pH = 8) conditions, which resulted in the formation of GOQDs. The GOQDs had diameters in the range of 5–13 nm (9.6 nm on average), consisting of 1–3 layers of graphene, and exhibited blue emissions with a QY of 6.9% following excitation at 320 nm. Pan et al. went on to improve the crystallinity of the GOQDs by reducing the GO sheets at a high temperature (600 °C).91 Hydrothermal cutting of the high-crystallinity oxidized graphene sheets under strongly alkaline (pH > 12) conditions produced well-crystallized GOQDs with diameters in the range of 1.5–5 nm (3 nm on average), consisting of 2–3 layers of graphene, and exhibiting green emissions with a QY of 7.5% following excitation at 420 nm.
2.2.1.2. Solvothermal cutting. 
Solvothermal cutting is similar to the hydrothermal method; however, aqueous solvents are replaced with organic solvents. Zhu et al. dissolved GO in dimethylformamide, followed by ultrasonication to enhance dispersion.41 The solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated to 200 °C. Removal of the solvent from the transparent brown suspension using a rotating evaporator resulted in solid GOQDs with an average diameter of 5.3 nm and an average height of 1.2 nm; these exhibited green emissions with a QY of 11.4% following excitation at 375 nm.
2.2.1.3. Acidic oxidation cutting. 
Shen et al. prepared GOQDs from a starting material of PEGylated GO.92 GO was first oxidized by HNO3 with reflux and then cut into small GO sheets. The GO sheets were treated with an oligomeric PEG diamine (PEG1500N) as a surface passivation agent through a ring opening reaction with epoxy groups under basic conditions (pH = 8). The precursor was reduced by hydrazine hydration to obtain PEG1500N-GOQDs ranging in diameter from 5 to 19 nm (13.3 nm on average) and exhibiting strong blue emissions with a QY of 7.4% following excitation at 360 nm. Shen et al. improved the QY by replacing PEG1500N with PEG 10000, using a hydrothermal route instead of hydrazine hydration reduction.93 The resulting PEG-GOQDs ranged in diameter from 5 to 25 nm (13 nm on average) and exhibited blue emissions with a QY of 28% following excitation at 340 nm. For the sake of comparison, they also prepared GOQDs without PEG, the results of which led to a QY of only 13.1%. In 2003, Jin et al. treated the same type of small GO sheets with PEG diamine (average molecular weight of 3400).32 These sheets were then reduced using N2H2 to obtain PEG diamine GOQDs with an average diameter of 2.45 ± 0.65 nm within a structure of 1–3 layers.
Pan et al. achieved a large-scale synthesis of GOQDs through the acidic oxidation and cutting of pitch carbon fibers.89 The carbon fibers were dispersed in a mixture of concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3, which was sonicated for 2 hours and then stirred for 24 hours at various temperatures (120, 100, and 80 °C). The mixtures were diluted to a pH of 8, followed by dialysis for purification. This resulted in three types of GOQDs with diameters of 1–4, 4–8, and 7–11 nm. All of the GOQDs consisted of 1–3 graphene layers. Following excitation at 318, 331, and 429 nm, the GOQDs (1–4 nm, 4–8 nm, and 7–11 nm) exhibited blue, green, and yellow PL emissions, respectively. Xie et al. adopted this synthesis method (100 °C) to separate the GOQDs using a dialysis bag.94 The GOQDs inside and outside the dialysis bag exhibited green and blue emissions following excitation at 294 and 373 nm, respectively.
Dong et al. developed a new and easy method for the preparation of GOQDs via the acidic oxidation of a common carbon source, CX-72 carbon black. The CX-72 carbon black mixed with highly concentrated HNO3 underwent refluxing for 24 hours, whereupon the suspension was centrifuged to obtain a supernatant and a sediment. The supernatant was heated to 200 °C to evaporate the water and nitric acid, resulting in a reddish-brown solid. Most of the resulting single-layered GOQDs had an average diameter of 15 nm, the solution of which was shown to emit strong green PL following excitation at 460 nm. The sediment was washed using HCl, dried, and then redispersed in water. The solution was then ultrafiltered through a centrifugal filter device to obtain multilayered (2–6 layers) GOQDs with an average diameter of 18 nm, which emitted strong yellow PL following excitation at 500 nm.
2.2.1.4. Electrochemical cutting. 
Electrochemical cutting is based on the application of a sufficiently high redox potential to oxidize the C–C bonds or electrolyte to generate radicals for subsequent cleavage reactions. Li et al. first produced GOQDs using an electrochemical method in a phosphate buffer solution with a filtration-formed graphene film as the working electrode, which was applied to a cyclic-voltammetry scan within a potential region of ±3 V.95 The collected GOQDs presented uniform diameters of 3–5 nm with topographic heights between 1 and 2 nm, corresponding to 1–3 layers of graphene. The GOQDs emitted green luminescence under irradiation of 365 nm.
Zhang et al. produced GOQDs by electrochemically exfoliating graphite rods under basic conditions with a current intensity in the range of 80–200 mA cm−2.96 The GOQDs were further reduced using hydrazine at room temperature. The resulting GOQDs had an average diameter of 5–10 nm with a thickness of less than 0.5 nm, which indicated a single-layer structure. The GOQDs emitted strong yellow luminescence following excitation at 360 nm, with a QY of 14%.
Shinde and Pillai employed a two-step electrochemical process to transform multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into GOQDs.88 A glassy carbon electrode was coated with the MWCNTs to form a working electrode. The electrolyte was propylene carbonate with LiClO4. The application of an anodic potential initiated the oxidation of MWCNTs, which was followed by the application of a cathodic potential to promote the intercalation of Li+ and propylene carbonate complexes, resulting in the exfoliation of the MWCNTs. Maintaining the anodic potential for 15, 11, and 7 hours led to the formation of three types of GOQDs with different diameters (3 ± 0.3, 5 ± 0.3, and 8.2 ± 0.3 nm, respectively), as well as different heights (1–2, 3, and 5 nm, respectively). Under excitation at 346 nm, the QY was 5.1–6.3%.
2.2.1.5. Microwave-assisted cutting. 
Microwaves are a convenient and rapidly applied heat source, capable of shortening reaction times and improving product yields. Li et al. built an easy microwave-assisted method for the production of two-colored GOQDs from GO treated with concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4.42 The oxidized GO sheets were shown to possess high oxidation levels. Under microwave irradiation, the epoxy groups were prone to form mixed lines on the carbon lattice, resulting in fragile C–C bonds. They produced a deep yellow solution containing mostly single-layer or bilayer GOQDs with an average diameter of 4.5 nm, exhibiting a greenish-yellow luminescence following excitation at 340 nm, and a QY of 11.7%. Moderately reducing these QDs with NaBH4 resulted in QDs with the same dimensions and heights, but exhibiting blue luminescence following excitation at 260 nm and a QY of 22.9%. Chen et al. reported a one-step microwave-assisted hydrothermal (200 °C) procedure for the production of GOQDs with an average diameter of 3 nm and a topographic height of less than 0.7 nm, which exhibited blue PL emissions.97
2.2.1.6. Ultrasonic cutting. 
Ultrasound can be used for cutting GO into GOQDs through the generation of a violent collapse of small bubbles (cavitations), resulting in deagglomeration and strong hydrodynamic shear forces along the vacancy defects in GO. Zhuo et al. produced a simple ultrasonic method for the production of GOQDs from graphene sheets treated with acid to promote oxidation.43 The diameter of the GOQDs was in the range of 3–5 nm, and strong blue PL emissions were exhibited following excitation at 330 nm.
2.2.1.7. Other cutting methods. 
Lin et al. developed a novel chemical method for the preparation of GOQDs via the cutting of MWCNTs and graphite flakes.98 The addition of potassium to the MWCNTs and graphite flakes resulted in potassium–graphite intercalation compounds, formed by intercalating potassium atoms between the covalently bonded graphene sheets. Following exposure of the compounds to air and under the assistance of ultrasonication, the graphene sheets were separated and disintegrated to yield GOQDs. The resulting GOQDs had a diameter of 20 nm, and most were monolayered. The GOQDs synthesized from MWCNTs and graphite flakes presented QY values of 6.53% and 7.12%, respectively, following excitation at 320 nm.


2.2.2. PL emissions of GOQDs prepared using bottom-up methods. 
2.2.2.1. Pyrolysis or carbonization of organic precursors. 
Liu et al. prepared GOQDs by applying carbonization and oxidation to a precursor of unsubstituted hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene and surface functionalization with PEG1500N to enhance dispersibility in water, which was then reduced using hydrazine.99 The resulting PEG-GOQDs had an average diameter of 60 nm and a thickness of 2–3 nm. They emitted strong blue PL with a QY of 3.8% following excitation at 365 nm.
Tang et al. proposed a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method for the preparation of GOQDs with blue fluorescence from a precursor of glucose.46 The diameters of the resulting GOQDs could be adjusted from 1.65 to 21 nm, simply by prolonging the heating time from 1 to 9 minutes. This approach also enabled the fabrication of multilayered (<10 layers) GOQDs, the QY values of which were 7–11% following excitation at 375 nm. By mixing citric acid as the carbon source and thiourea as the nitrogen and sulfur sources in a hydrothermal method, Qu et al. synthesized nitrogen and sulfur codoped GOQDs, which presented an outstanding QY of 78%.100 The resulting QDs had an average diameter of 3.1 ± 0.54 nm and a height of 0.5–2 nm, comprising 1–5 graphene layers.
2.2.2.2. Stepwise organic-chemical synthesis. 
Yan et al. synthesized graphene quantum dots (GQDs) using a stepwise method based on solution chemistry.27,45,101,102 The size of the resulting GQDs was uniform and tunable, comprising 168, 132, and 170 conjugate carbon atoms produced through the oxidation of a polyphenylene dendritic precursor, based on an oxidative condensation reaction. The GQDs were stabilized by multiple 2′,4′,6′-trialkyl phenyl groups attached to the edge of the GQDs, thereby making the GQDs hydrophilic. The diameter of the GQDs was 2.5–5 nm, depending on the synthesized aromatic rings. The 2.5 nm GQDs exhibited red PL emissions, measured at 670 nm.103


2.2.3. PL emissions of surface-modified GOQDs. 
2.2.3.1. Tuning oxidation levels. 
In GOQDs, most of the carbon atoms bonded with oxygen are hybrid sp3, which can lead to the radiative recombination of localized electron–hole pairs. sp3 carbon atoms in the vicinity of sp2 carbon atoms can induce a charge transfer by acting as surface emissive sites or traps. Tuning the oxidation level through reduction can create sp2 domains and surface defects to enhance blue PL emissions.38 Li et al. used a simple microwave-assisted route for the production of green fluorescent GOQDs (gGOQDs) with a QY of 11.7% following excitation at 340 nm.42 Moderately reducing the gGOQDs with NaBH4 resulted in QDs with blue luminescence of the same diameter and height; however, a higher QY of 22.9% was obtained following excitation at 260 nm. Considering the identical dimensions of the GOQDs, the difference in emission colors (from green to blue) could be attributed to the removal of oxygen atoms. Zhu et al. synthesized gGOQDs using a solvothermal method.104 Reduction with NaBH4 did not alter the structure (3.6 nm diameter and 1.02 nm height); however, the fluorescence of the GOQDs was transformed to blue and the QY was increased from 5.9% to 12.1% under excitation at 416 nm. They postulated that nonradiative recombination sites (such as epoxy groups) changed into hydroxyl groups, which further enhanced the integrity of the π-conjugated system. In addition to controlling the oxidation levels through reduction, Zhu et al. separated the GOQDs prepared by the solvothermal method into three batches, by using column chromatography with gradient elution.105 The GOQDs in the three batches presented similar diameters (3–5 nm) and heights (0.95 nm); however, the fluorescence could be tuned between blue and green under the same excitation wavelengths by altering the oxidation levels from low to high. Under excitation at 380 nm, the measured QYs for the three batches were 4.1%, 9.9%, and 12.2%, which could be attributed to the higher oxidation levels creating a greater number of surface defects for radiative recombination.
Liu et al. used graphite nanoparticles as the starting material for the production of homogeneous GQDs without oxygen functional groups (exfoliating using organic solvents under ultrasonication) and GOQDs (using a modification of the method proposed by Hummer).106 The resulting GQDs and GOQDs had identical diameters of 4 nm or less, and both were monolayered. As outlined in Li et al.42 and Sun et al.,111 the GQDs exhibited blue fluorescence and the GOQDs exhibited green fluorescence. These results provided direct evidence to support the supposition that the blue fluorescence of GQDs is dominated by intrinsic states of the sp2 domain, whereas the green fluorescence of GOQDs originates in the defect states induced by oxygen functional groups.
Photocatalytic reduction is a novel approach to GO reduction, involving mechanisms that are different from those of photothermal reduction.106 Under light irradiation, GO semiconductors generate electron–hole pairs. The photocatalytic reduction of GO involves the transfer of photogenerated electrons to other GO sheets and photogenerated holes reacting with water, resulting in the formation of peroxide. Sun et al. adopted this approach and added isopropanol as the photogenerated hole trapping agent into the GOQD suspension under UV light irradiation.107 The original GOQDs, prepared by microwave-assisted acidic oxidation cutting, emitted green fluorescence. Following photocatalytic reduction, the green fluorescent GOQDs were transformed into blue fluorescent GOQDs. Before and after photocatalytic reduction, the GOQDs had similar average diameters of 5.6 nm and similar average heights of 1.5–1.6 nm. Under excitation at 320 nm and 480 nm, the QY values were 2.4% and 8.8%, respectively, which demonstrates the effectiveness of photocatalytic reduction in improving the QY of GOQDs.
Liu et al. applied annealing to GOQDs prepared using a hydrothermal method at 900 °C under H2.108 Although this led to the removal of many oxygen functional groups (the oxygen content varied from 81 to 24 at%), the reduced GOQDs (rGOQDs) dispersed uniformly in water. The GOQDs and rGOQDs had similar average diameters of 3 nm and 2.9 nm, respectively. The blue fluorescent GOQDs changed to purple fluorescent rGOQDs, which indicates an increase in the number of sp2 domains.
2.2.3.2. Surface functionalization (surface-transfer doping). 
Surface functionalization using molecules or polymers with a strong electron-donating or electron-accepting ability can greatly alter the electronic structure of GOQDs to tune PL emissions and reduce the nonradiative structure to enhance QY. Electron-donating functionalities generally raise HOMO levels and electron-withdrawing functionalities generally lower LUMO levels.109 Regarding the structure of GOQDs, functionalities can passivate the nonradiative recombination induced by the epoxy and carboxyl groups through nucleophilic and esterification reactions.76 A number of alkylamines, PEG amines, and polyethylamines have been used as surface passivation agents to enhance intrinsic sp2 domain emissions, which can increase the QY of surface-passivated GOQD specimens.32,92,104 Previous studies have examined the effects of functionalities on sp2 domains, because of their importance in the tunability of PL emissions. Fig. 11(a) presents the basic model of amino-functionalized sp2 domains in GQDs. The domains of 13 aromatic rings decorated with amino functionalities were used as the model to simplify the theoretical calculations. According to DFT calculations, the bandgap of the 13 aromatic rings was 2.5 eV, as shown in Fig. 11(b). The bandgap gradually decreased with an increase in the number of amino functionalities. Fig. 11(c) presents the electronic structure of these amino-functionalized GQDs, and the HOMO and LUMO for the amino functionality. Increasing the number of attached amino functionalities elevated the HOMO state of GQDs, because of the donation of electrons from the long pairs of amino functionalities to the GQDs. The results show how the increase in amino functionalities decreased the bandgap of GQDs.

Tetsuka et al. presented a hydrothermal strategy using an ammonia solution for the fabrication of amino-functionalized GOQDs from GO sheets.31 Before extracting sp2 domains from GO sheets, the ammonia reacts with epoxy groups to form primary amines and alcohols, which enables the self-limited extraction of sp2 domains. The modified GO was subjected to a hydrothermal treatment (70–150 °C) to extract amino-functionalized GOQDs (Fig. 11(d)). The extracted amino-functionalized GOQDs exhibited strong fluorescence, from violet to yellow depending on the treatment temperature (tested at 150, 120, 70, and 90 °C, and in a double concentrated ammonia solution at 90 °C), containing low to high concentrations of amino functionalities (Fig. 11(e)). No noticeable change was observed in the diameter (2.5 nm) or thickness (1.13 nm). Thus, we can conclude that the adjustability of PL was due to differences in the quantity of functionalized amino functionalities, which complies with the DFT calculations in Fig. 11(c). The QYs of 29–19% decreased with an increase in the quantity of amino functionalities. Fluorine functionalities with a high electronegativity can also be used for tuning the electronic structure of GOQDs. Feng et al. prepared fluorinated GOQDs by mixing GO sheets with XeF2 in a one-step hydrothermal process.110 The resulting fluorinated GOQDs had diameters ranging from 1 to 7 nm and exhibited blue fluorescence with a QY of 6.28%.
Most of the functionalized GOQDs were obtained by the hydrothermal route, involving high pressure and relatively high temperatures.31,32,92,104,110,111 Jiang et al. presented a facile route for the synthesis of amino-functionalized GOQDs.112 A synergistic reaction was conducted by mixing ammonia as a surface passivation agent and peroxide as a cutting agent on GO sheets. The resulting QDs had an average diameter of 7.5 nm and an average height of 0.8 nm, implying that the GOQDs were single-layered. Green PL was visible under a 420 nm UV light and a QY of 4.4% was achieved.
A one-step pyrolysis reaction was conducted to synthesize glutathione-functionalized GOQDs from a mixture of citric acid and glutathione.113 The resulting glutathione-functionalized GOQDs had diameters in the range of 6–10 nm and topographic heights of 2–3 nm, corresponding to 3–5 graphene layers. The QDs emitted strong blue fluorescence under excitation at 365 nm and a QY of 33.6% was obtained under excitation at 346 nm.
2.3.3.3. Substitutional doping. 
Doping is an effective means of altering the electronic density of bulk semiconducting materials and tuning their optical and electronic properties. Similarly, doping graphene with substituent heteroatoms (such as nitrogen atoms) can effectively modulate the bandgap of graphene and induce localized states for PL emission.19,64,82,83 This approach can also be applied to the doping of GOQDs with heteroatoms to tailor the electronic properties. Among the various elements used for substitutional doping, nitrogen is the most common candidate for graphene because of its comparable atomic size to carbon and its larger number of valence electrons. Li et al. reported a simple electrochemical approach to the preparation of nitrogen-doped GOQDs (NGOQDs) from a graphene film in nitrogen-containing tetrabutylammonium perchlorate, using acetonitrile as the solvent.44 Nitrogen atoms can be introduced into GOQDs produced by cyclic-voltammetry scanning over a potential window of ±3 V. The N/C atomic ratio of NGOQDs is 4.3%. GOQDs and NGOQDs have similar diameters of 2–5 nm and heights of 1–2.5 nm. Unlike the green luminescence of GOQDs, NGOQDs emit a distinct blue luminescence, which indicates that substitutional doping plays a major role in redistributing the electronic structure of GOQDs.
Li et al. produced NGOQDs by a simple hydrothermal route, using nitrogen-doped graphene as the starting material, which was obtained by annealing GO in an ammonia atmosphere.114 The NGOQDs had diameters of 1–7 nm and an N/C atomic ratio of 5.6%. Bright blue luminescence was observed with a QY of 8.6% under excitation at 310 nm. Hu et al. produced NGOQDs from the hydrothermal treatment of GO with ammonia and both pyridine-like and pyrrolic nitrogen atoms were present in the as-received NGOQDs.115 NGOQDs with a higher N/C atomic ratio of 17.88% exhibited strongly blue luminescence and a high QY of 24.6% under excitation at 340 nm, which could be attributed to the dual influence of amino functionalization and nitrogen doping. Dai et al. proposed a facile process for the fabrication of nitrogen-doped GQDs (NGQDs), in which the N/C ratio could be precisely tailored from 8.3% to 5.8% via hydrothermal treatment.116 The resulting NGQDs presented a QY of 34.5% under excitation at 320 nm. However, excess N dopants in NGQDs can quench the PL through nonradiative transition back to the ground state.
A one-step synthesis method was developed to prepare large quantities of NGOQDs by mixing glucose directly in an ammonia solution at room temperature under atmospheric pressure.117 The presence of ammonia catalyzed the dehydration process between glucose molecules and the aqueous solution. The ammonia also served as a reactant, resulting in the incorporation of nitrogen into the graphene matrix. The resulting NGOQDs had an average diameter of 4.1 nm and an average height of 4.2 nm, with a green-yellow fluorescence and a QY of 7.5%.
Other elements, such as boron and sulfur, are suitable for the substitutional doping of GOQDs.100,118,119 Fan et al. reported an electrochemical approach to the synthesis of boron-doped GOQDs with a B/C atomic ratio of 5.24%.118 Boron doping resulted in three valence electrons, which is fewer than that found in carbon, and resulted in p-type conductivity. The boron-doped GOQDs emitted green PL with a low QY of 3.6% under excitation at 340 nm. The addition of borax to separate the boron-doped GOQDs led to an increase in the intrinsic QY to 13%. The PL did not shift from its green color (no fluorescence of borax was observed).


2.2.4. PL mechanisms associated with GOQDs. 
As shown in Table 1, top-down methods, bottom-up methods, and routes for engineering the electronic structure can be used to prepare GOQDs capable of emitting PL of various colors and QYs. Most of the mechanisms proposed to explain luminescence have been based on intrinsic sp2 domains and sp3 domains associated with defects and edges. However, even widely accepted explanations regarding the PL of GOQDs require systematic investigation. A feasible, comprehensive explanation for the PL of GOQDs would have to take into account a wide variety of dependencies between PL and excitation (in)dependence, pH values, the effects of solvents, the tuning of surface chemistry through experimental investigations, and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques in conjunction with ultrafast dynamic characterizations.
2.2.4.1. Excitation dependence or independence. 
Excitation dependence is generally attributed to two mechanisms. Differences in the size and oxidation level of particle sizes with different oxidation levels induced the various PL colors instead of pure particle sizes. The other mechanism is influenced by the sp2 domains existing in GOQD particles. As shown by DFT calculations, the bandgap decreases with an increasing number of aromatic rings. A total of 37 aromatic rings (a diameter of approximately 1.7 nm) produce a bandgap of approximately 2 eV.29 Most of the GOQDs prepared using the aforementioned routes have particle sizes exceeding 1.7 nm and therefore a bandgap below 2 eV. Ito et al. showed that graphene with an infinite lateral size is a zero-bandgap semiconductor. The adsorption of oxygen into graphene damages the π and π* orbitals, thereby producing a bandgap in graphene. Introducing a greater number of oxygen atoms enlarges the bandgap, such that the VBM gradually changes from the π orbital of graphene to the 2p orbital of oxygen, thereby forming an indirect bandgap.14 This means that the fluorescence of large GOQDs (measured laterally) originates in the band-edge transition, as is the case for typical semiconductors, rather than in localized electronic states. Thus, the sp3 domains in a single GOQD particle are responsible for the band-edge transition, whereas sp2 domains may contribute to localized electronic states in the bandgap.
Pan et al. synthesized at low temperatures three types of GOQDs with diameters in the ranges of 1–4, 4–8, and 7–11 nm via acidic oxidation without reduction (such as hydrothermal and solvothermal routes, or electrochemical routes).89 This indicates that large GOQDs have low oxidation levels. Fig. 12(a) presents the optical properties of GOQDs. The absorption peaks of GOQDs with low oxidation levels are red-shifted. The inset of Fig. 12(a) presents the blue, green, and yellow PL emissions corresponding to GOQDs of 1–4, 4–8, and 7–11 nm, respectively, under excitation at 365 nm. The GOQDs also presented excitation-dependent PL properties (Fig. 12(b)), which are consistent with the model in which sp2 and sp3 domains exist in a single GOQD particle. A similar investigation was reported by Dong et al. with regard to the production of GOQDs from carbon black via acidic oxidation.90

GOQDs can be prepared by the simultaneous reduction of the produced GOQDs, forming sp2 domains.46,88 The reduction process produces GOQDs of different sizes but with similar reduction levels. Shinde and Pillai used an electrochemical process to transform MWCNTs into four types of GOQDs with diameters of 3 ± 0.3, 5 ± 0.3, 8.2 ± 0.3, and 23 ± 2 nm.88 The GOQDs exhibited similar PL patterns under excitation at identical wavelengths (Fig. 12(c)–(f)). Excitation-dependent luminescence was observed for the GOQDs; however, the emission intensity was lower at longer wavelengths, indicating that electrons excited to lower energy states were prone to nonradiative recombination. These investigations clearly indicate that GOQD particle size is not a key factor in PL.
Excitation-independent PL behavior can be observed for GOQDs that have intact surfaces,43,96,100 which can lead to band-edge transitions for radiative recombination. For example, GOQDs prepared by the ultrasonic cutting of GO sheets emit excitation-independent PL because this mild method of cutting does not produce vacancy defects through the removal of C–O bonds.43
2.2.4.2. pH and solvent dependence. 
GOQD structures have been proposed with edges that appear randomized, preferably in the form of armchairs or zigzags.120 Attempts to passivate or rearrange the edge of carbon atoms in GOQDs via annealing have led to the quenching of PL intensity; however, the other spectral features remained identical to those in untreated GOQDs. Lingam et al. demonstrated that armchair and zigzag edges behave like carbyne and carbene sites, respectively, both of which can lead to PL in GOQDs. Pan et al. prepared GOQDs using a hydrothermal method in which the pH values of the GOQD solution were tuned.40 Under alkaline conditions, GOQDs emitted strong PL, whereas under acidic conditions the PL was completely quenched (Fig. 13(a)). The PL intensity varied reversibly simply by altering the media to acidic or alkaline. Fig. 13(b) presents the structural models of GOQDs in acidic and alkaline conditions, based on the reversible protonation of carbene-like zigzag sites. Under acidic conditions, the free zigzag sites of the GOQDs were protonated and the PL became inactive. However, under alkaline conditions, the free zigzag sites were restored, leading to the restoration of PL. One mechanism for this was proposed by Pan et al., wherein luminescence was said to originate from the free zigzag sites with a carbene-like triplet ground state described as singly occupied σ1π1 (Fig. 13(c)). PL emissions are the irradiation resulting from the decay of activated electrons from LUMO to HOMO, resulting in the emission of blue light.

All pH-dependent PL behavior, except for that induced by the edges, can be traced to surface functionalities. In the case of oxygen functionalities on GOQDs, COOH exhibits two reversible formulae, COOH and COO−, under acidic and basic conditions, respectively.104 The characteristics of PL are extremely different under basic and acidic conditions. This observation is supported by a report on GOQDs, alkylamine-modified GOQDs (mGOQDs), and NaBH4-reduced GOQDs. The PL peaks in the mGOQDs and NaBH4-reduced GOQDs remained nearly unchanged between pH 0 and 14; however, significant changes were observed in GOQDs under high pH conditions (Fig. 13(d)). Additionally, under low pH conditions, some of the amide bonds in the mGOQDs broke, resulting in the appearance of a new emission peak (Fig. 13(e)). Similar to the pH-dependent case, the choice of solvent also affected the PL characteristics of GOQDs. GOQDs synthesized from a solvothermal method were dispersed in tetrahydrofuran, acetone, dimethylformamide, and water.41Fig. 13(f) illustrates the shifts in PL peaks from 475 to 515 nm under the four different solvents. These results indicate that the emission from sp3 defects is highly susceptible to changes in the environment, whereas the intrinsic emission of sp2 domains is not.
2.2.4.3. Tuning surface chemistry to change PL mechanisms. 
Many strategies have been developed for the synthesis of NGOQDs with strong PL (Table 1).121 However, the effect of nitrogen on the electronic structure of NGOQDs remains unclear. Tang et al. reported an electronic structure characterized according to optical properties, as determined by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).117Fig. 14(a) presents the optical absorption spectra of NGOQDs, exhibiting three absorption peaks at 202 nm (π → π* of CC), 274 nm (n → π* of CN), and 302 nm (n → π* of CO). The absorbance of the three peaks is inversely proportional to the dilution fold. Fig. 14(b) shows the EELS results with three obvious peaks centered at 290.8, 400.9, and 533.2 eV, which are attributed to the K-edges of C, N, and O, respectively. All of the K-edge spectra of C, N, and O presented two peaks, corresponding to 1s → π* and 1s → σ* of CC, CN, and CN (Fig. 14(c) and (d)). Fig. 14(f) shows NGOQD thin films excited by light of various wavelengths. The thin films emitted blue light under short-wavelength excitation; however, the emission color changes to white under long-wavelength excitation. The results demonstrate excitation-dependent PL. The conversion of blue light to white light was due to the mixing of blue incident light with the green-yellow fluorescence emitted from the NGOQD thin films. Fig. 14(g) presents the energy levels of the NGOQDs, as determined by the optical spectra and the EELS results. Two mechanisms were used to represent the deactivation of excited electrons. One involved direct recombination following the relaxation of vibrations, resulting in the production of PL. The second mechanism involved intersystem transfer of electrons (C π* → N π*, and N π* → O π*), followed by vibration relaxation and radiative recombination. This mechanism is consistent with a previous study72 that described a charge separation mechanism between electron states in the close proximity to sp2 and sp3 domains.

Kumar et al. demonstrated that the PL emission of GOQDs is unrelated to particle size, but is rather due to the effects of functionalities on GOQDs. These claims are based on similarities in the PL spectra of amino-functionalized GOQDs and those of amino-functionalized GO sheets under excitation at the same wavelength.122 A similar PL mechanism was proposed in a study120 that further verified the proposed energy band model using DFT calculations. This confirms that functionalization does not always change the π–π* direct bandgap, because newly created energy levels can also exist as interband states capable of converting the transfer of energy from direct to indirect.
2.2.4.4. Ultrafast dynamic characterization of PL mechanisms. 
Wang et al. performed a combination of femtosecond broadband transient absorption spectroscopy and femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence dynamics to determine the origin of PL in GOQDs.123Fig. 15(a) illustrates how hydroxyl and epoxy groups played the role of a potential well, providing quantum confinement and leading to discrete quantum states. Owing to the possible synergy or competition between size and edge effects, Wang et al. revealed three emission states (Paths 1–3 in Fig. 15(a)) in green fluorescent GOQDs. Two bright, molecule-like states and one intrinsic state were incorporated in the green PL (Fig. 15(b)). The synergy of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups was the major factor in green PL (Molecule-like State 1, Path 1), and the hydroxyl groups alone, appearing at the lateral edge or in-plane, provided blue fluorescence (Molecule-like State 2, Path 2). Both of the emissions from molecule-like states exhibited long decay times because of the surface trap states of oxygen functional groups. A dominant blue emission resulting from the intrinsic state and attributed to quantum confinement (Intrinsic State, Path 3) was observed with short decay times in picoseconds. The three emission states constituted the PL of green-fluorescence GOQDs. All of these mechanisms displayed excited-state absorption of various energy levels, depending on the surface functionalities, which led to the investigation of GOQDs with the two-photon absorption mechanism. The effect of oxygen functionalities on GOQDs was further investigated according to the reduction process.124 The molecule-like states contained carboxyl and carbonyl groups, which formed special conformations in the edge area and acted as the source for green emissions. This emission mechanism competed with various edge states that were nonradiative.

3. Photovoltaic application of GO nanomaterials as a photosensitizer
3.1. Solar cells based on semiconductor sensitization
Several interests have motivated the development of alternative energy sources, and solar energy has been considered the most valuable energy source because it is abundant, clean, and safe. Photovoltaic devices are based on the concept of charge separation at the interface of two materials with different conduction mechanisms. This field has been dominated by solid-state junction devices, usually made of silicon.125 Unfortunately, energy-intensive, high-temperature, and high-vacuum processes are required for the fabrication of these conventional devices. One strategy for the development of chemical-based solar energy conversion is semiconductor–liquid junction solar cells. In early studies of photoelectrochemical cells, only single crystals or flat electrodes of polycrystalline films of tin oxide or titanium oxide were used. Despite efficient electron injection into the semiconductor, the light harvesting efficiency was extremely low and the efficiency of the solar cells was below 1%.125–127 In 1991, Grätzel reported a porous film of nanocrystalline TiO2 particles deposited on a conductive glass electrode. The enormous surface area of the nanocrystalline TiO2 enhanced the light harvesting efficiency by an order of magnitude.128 This type of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) differed from conventional semiconductor devices by separating the function of light absorption from charge carrier transport. Fig. 16 presents a schematic diagram of the operating principles of a DSSC. At the heart of the system is an oxide semiconductor with a wide bandgap placed in contact with a redox electrolyte or organic hole conductor.129 The materials used on mesoporous oxide films, such as TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, and Nb2O5, have been used for interconnections to facilitate electronic conduction.125,130,131 A monolayer of dye molecules is attached to the surface of the nanocrystalline film. Illumination raises the dye to an electronically excited state, which is quenched by electron transfer to the conduction band of the semiconductor, leaving the dye in an oxidized state. The oxidized dye is reduced by an electron donation from the electrolyte, which is usually a redox system containing an organic solvent such as an iodide or triiodide couple. Electrons collected in the conduction band are directed through the external circuit to arrive at the counter-electrode, where they cause a reverse reaction in the redox mediator. In this manner, the photoelectrochemical cell is also regenerative and the process leads to the direct conversion of sunlight into electricity.125
 Fig. 16  Principle of operation and energy level scheme of the dye-sensitized solar cell. Photoexcitation of the sensitizer (S) is followed by electron injection into the conduction band of an oxide semiconductor film. The dye molecule is regenerated by the redox system, which is itself regenerated at the counter-electrode by electrons passing through the load. Potentials are referred to the normal hydrogen electrode. The open circuit voltage of the solar cell corresponds to the difference between the redox potential of the mediator and the Fermi level of the nanocrystalline film that is indicated with a dashed line. The energy levels drawn for the sensitizer and the redox mediator match the redox potentials of the doubly deprotonated N3 sensitizer ground state and the iodide or triiodide couple.

3.2. GOQDs as a photosensitizer in solar cells
The function of the dye in DSSCs is to absorb light, inject electrons into the semiconductor, accept electrons from the redox couple in the solution, and then repeat the entire cycle. To be suitable for DSSCs, the dyes must possess several basic properties: (i) strong adsorption onto the semiconductor surface; (ii) strong harvesting capability of light across the visible spectrum; (iii) capability to inject electrons into the conduction band of the semiconductor; (iv) high stability and reversibility in oxidized, ground, and excited states; and (v) contain –COOH groups capable of anchoring to the TiO2 surface to ensure electron transfer at high rates.132–136 The most efficient sensitizers in nanocrystalline TiO2 DSSCs are based on bipyridyl complexes of transition metals, particularly ruthenium(II). Ru complexes make excellent photosensitizers for semiconductors because of their strong, broad absorption band in the visible range, resulting from metal to ligand charge transfers that produce excited states with long lifetimes. However, Ru complexes are complicated, expensive to synthesize, and contain a heavy metal that is harmful to the environment. Moreover, they are susceptible to degradation in the presence of water.136 In comparison to other light absorbers, such as ruthenium complexes and inorganic QDs that absorb light across the entire visible range, GOQDs are primarily made of elements that are abundant on the earth and do not contain rare or toxic heavy metals. The large optical absorptivity and widely tunable bandgap of GOQDs make them an attractive material for optical and optoelectrical devices. Photoexcited GOQDs present high probabilities of relaxing into triplet states, and have been shown to emit phosphorescence as well as fluorescence with intensities dependent on the excitation energy. Compared with singlet excited states, triplet excited states have significantly longer lifetimes and longer diffusion lengths. Both of these features are highly beneficial to applications involving graphene in photovoltaic devices, in which slower carrier recombination and long-distance charge transport are highly desirable.103
Graphene-based materials have been used as a medium for electron transfer and transportation to enhance solar-energy conversion efficiency.137–140 However, this auxiliary function of graphene-related materials is also employed in many other devices like batteries or fuel cells. This review therefore emphasizes the utilization of photoactive graphene materials that can generate electron–hole pairs under light irradiation. Li et al. took advantage of the zero bandgap of bulk graphene by employing a bottom-up method involving stepwise solution chemistry to synthesize soluble GOQDs with uniform size, shape, and properties. The ability to tune the absorption edge of graphene from 0 eV to that of benzene simply by varying the size of the particles makes it possible for GOQDs to cover the entire spectrum of sunlight in photovoltaic applications, such as the conversion of solar energy. The attachment of functional groups to GOQDs can also be used to control the interaction between GOQDs and TiO2 films. The presence of the carboxylic acid group causes GOQDs to align vertically on TiO2 surfaces (Fig. 17), which greatly accelerates the transfer of electrons when the GOQD sensitizers are photoexcited.101,141,142 Adopting a top-down approach, Dutta et al. presented a simple one-step hydrazine method to synthesize GOQDs from GO, and then combined them with ZnO nanowires to demonstrate their potential as a solar harvesting material in photovoltaic cells.143 Emission spectroscopy and photovoltaic measurements both confirmed the charge transfer at the interface between photoexcited GOQDs and ZnO nanowires. Even without optimization, the performance of solid-state solar cell devices comprising ZnO nanowire–GOQD composites was shown to reach a VOC of approximately 0.8 V. Pan et al. developed an electrophoretic assembly method for the fabrication of firm, homogeneous heterojunctions composed of highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays sensitized using water-soluble GOQDs.144 Catalytic activity under visible-light irradiation was shown to remain steady through continuous cycles with a negligible decrease in performance. By contrast, CdS- and CdSe-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays exhibited considerable cycling instability because of the effects of photooxidization. GOQD heterojunctions are superior to conventional semiconductor QDs in terms of visible-light catalytic activity, durability, and environmental friendliness.

3.3. Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) as a photosensitizer in solar cells
Different from disk-like GOQDs, CQDs are spherical nanoparticles consisting of graphene nanosheets with sizes less than 10 nm. These CQDs can be regarded as cores terminated with hydrogen atoms, in which the graphitic core exhibits size-dependent absorption and a large absorption coefficient. Analogous to the sensitive surface of graphene, CQDs are typically surface-functionalized with oxygen containing functional groups (i.e., carboxyl and hydroxyl) during synthesis, rendering them highly dispersed and stable in polar solvents. Further post-chemical functionalization on CQDs can promptly be accomplished due to the active oxygen functionalities on the surface. Highly active surface functionalities provide more opportunities for conjugation reaction to assemble, which enrich charge transport channels. In addition to the post-modification, the structural characteristics of the graphitic sp2-hybridized core change depending on the types of precursors, as well as synthesis procedures based on both top-down and bottom-up methods. Therefore, a high quality sp2-hybridized core with suitable surface functionalization is highly desirable for using CQDs as sensitizers in photovoltaic cells.145,146
Most efforts for CQD synthesis focused on top-down methods (i.e., laser ablation and electrochemical oxidation).147,148 These approaches consist of intense reactions that destroy the carbon structure into small pieces, difficult to control homogeneity for the spherical nanoparticles. The other methods, bottom-up synthesis, represent carbonization of organic or carbon-containing precursors.145,146 The reaction initializes when the nuclei formed by a precursor agglomeration operation. The bottom-up methods have clear advantages of controlling structures in terms of synthesis conditions and precursor selection.
Mirtchev et al. reported a facile, solution-phase synthesis via dehydration of γ-butyrolactone with concentrated sulphuric acid.145 A distinct feature of the CQDs is that initial aggregation of the nucleus seeds is prevented by H-capping. The seeds grow in size by accretion of carbonaceous species, and are then terminated with carboxyl and sulfonic functional groups. For CQD-sensitized solar cells, in addition to the carboxyl group, sulfonic groups also contribute to the coordination of CQDs on nanocrystalline TiO2, as shown in Fig. 18(a). Fig. 18(b) shows the current–voltage characteristics of a CQD-sensitized solar cell under simulated AM 1.5 global light irradiation. Compared to using CQDs modified by refluxing in nitric acid as sensitizers, the sulfonated CQDs produce higher short-circuit current density, suggesting more linkages between the sensitizer and TiO2 surface for fast charge transport.

Briscoe et al. prepared three different types of CQDs by a simple one-step hydrothermal carbonization of glucose, chitin, and chitosan, where the CQDs were named as G-CQDs, CT-CQDs, and CS-GQDs, respectively.146 The particle sizes of the CQDs are in the order of CS-CQDs > CT-CQDs > G-CQDs. The CT-CQDs and CS-CQDs are functionalized by amide and amine groups, respectively, whereas the G-CQDs contain only hydroxyl and epoxy groups on the surface. These three types of CQDs were used as sensitizers for ZnO-nanorod-based solar cells, and the CS-CQD-sensitized device has a relatively high performance. The high density of G-CQDs on the ZnO surface led to high absorption but exhibited low performance. The results suggest that the structural nature of the coated CQDs determines the solar-cell performance rather than the light-harvesting ability. In comparison with GOQDs as sensitizers in Section 3.2, spherical CQDs have a large exclusive volume, which makes them difficult to bond on the scaffolds in sensitized solar cells. Further surface modifications and size modulations may be required to eliminate the shortcomings of the CQDs in photovoltaic applications.
4. Photocatalytic water splitting using GO nanomaterials
Since 1972, when Fujishima and Honda149 discovered the photocatalytic splitting of water using TiO2 electrodes, researchers have made considerable efforts to promote the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic production of H2 from water involving the direct application of solar energy.150–154 Unlike conventional photoelectrochemical cells, powder-system photocatalytic water splitting does not require electrodes or wires, which makes it desirable for H2 production on a large scale. Numerous active inorganic semiconductors, such as various oxides, (oxy)nitrides, and (oxy)sulfides, have been developed for use as photocatalysts in water splitting.155–168 Photocatalytic materials commonly include rare materials and rely on high-temperature synthesis methods to achieve high crystallinity.169 In addition, these energy-hungry processes often reduce the specific surface area of the photocatalysts. The interfacial area between solid and liquid water is central to photochemical reactions and should be sufficiently large to allow for water dissociation at a high specific rate. Therefore, the emergence of two-dimensional nanomaterials, with large specific surface areas capable of providing numerous active sites for photochemical reactions, has presented a variety of new strategies for exploiting renewable energy sources.170,171
SLG is currently the most promising of these two-dimensional nanomaterials. The large specific surface area of graphene offers tremendous opportunities for tuning the surface chemistry via chemical modification.172 However, graphene sheets are hydrophobic and tend to be too unstable for direct applications in water splitting. However, GO sheets derived from graphite via strong oxidation processes15 are hydrophilic, and tailoring their surface properties is relatively straightforward because of the highly reactive oxygen functional groups on GO.20,21,173 Extended GO sheets have a large specific surface area, which opens new avenues for the construction of light harvesting assemblies. Furthermore, GO has shown considerable promise as a starting material for the generation of colloidal suspensions of rGO, chemically modified GO, and GO-based nanocomposites, using a variety of techniques including hydrothermal, solvothermal, and photocatalytic methods. Graphene sheets of GO and rGO both contain oxygen functionalities; however, the oxidation levels vary. Unlike graphene, the residual oxygen functional groups of GO nanocomposites enable their dispersion in water. Hereafter, we use the collective name GO to represent as-received GO as well as rGO. Many researchers29,30,174–184 have demonstrated the ability of GO to function as an electron sink, electron transport mediator, and redox mediator for charge separation, as well as a photocatalyst for water splitting. Table 2 presents a summary of the previous studies on GO-based nanomaterials for photocatalytic water splitting. The applicability of the materials depends on the type and quantity of the functionalities introduced. The mechanisms underlying electron transfer on GO sheets have not previously been discussed. In this section, we focus on the behavior of electrons on GO according to the novel electronic structures associated with PL.

4.1. GO as an electron acceptor
GO is capable of accepting photogenerated electrons from the CBM of most semiconductors and the LUMO of molecular dyes, thereby effectively suppressing charge recombination and significantly enhancing the photocatalytic evolution of H2. In Section 2, we outlined a new concept of GO electronic structures on the basis of PL characterization. Having sp2 domains embedded within an sp3 matrix is a common structure associated with GO. Following reduction, a number of sp3 domains are restored to sp2 configurations; however, most of the sp2 domains remain isolated because of the disordered carbon atoms surrounding them. The sp3 domains and/or disordered carbon atoms still function as potential wells, thereby providing quantum confinement, which results in discrete quantum states. Many GO-based nanocomposites consisting of inorganic semiconductors or molecular dyes have already been developed, and many of these have shown considerable promise.

4.1.1. GO-inorganic semiconductor nanocomposites. 
A number of GO–TiO2 hybrid materials have been used to harness photon energy for the generation of H2via the decomposition of water.185–192 The production of GO–TiO2 composites by using the sol–gel method is approximately twice as effective in producing H2, compared to P25 nanoparticles under UV-visible light irradiation.185 Among the various methods developed for the synthesis of GO–TiO2 composites, the hydrothermal method is particularly valuable for its ability to synthesize composites with strong interaction forces between GO and TiO2 (H2: 74 μmol h−1), resulting in performance one order of magnitude higher than that of TiO2 alone (H2: 6.8 μmol h−1) under UV-visible light irradiation.186 Pt-loaded GO–TiO2 composites synthesized using a hydrothermal method are capable of catalysis that is 30 times more effective (H2: 751 μmol h−1) than that of GO–TiO2 (H2: 19.5 μmol h−1) under UV-visible light irradiation.188 MoS2 with a layered structure has also shown considerable potential as a cocatalyst for H2 evolution. MoS2–GO–TiO2 composites have been shown to reach a high H2 production rate of 165 μmol h−1 under UV light irradiation, which is higher than that of GO–TiO2 (29.7 μmol h−1).192 This outstanding photocatalytic activity is due to the positive synergetic effect of Pt–GO and MoS2–GO hybrid components as cocatalysts.
The UV region accounts for only 4% of the solar spectrum, whereas visible light occupies approximately 43% of the total energy available from sunlight. For this reason, photocatalysts driven by visible light have been investigated extensively. GO has been introduced as an electron acceptor to enhance responses in the visible light spectrum. Among visible-light-driven photocatalysts, CdS particles have relatively narrow bandgaps with band edges suitable for water reduction under visible-light irradiation. However, these particles suffer from low electron–hole pair separation efficiency193 and a tendency to aggregate, resulting in a reduced surface area. The introduction of CdS to GO sheets can help prevent particle aggregation and suppress charge recombination by channeling electrons into GO substrates.191,194–199 One such GO–CdS composite was prepared using a solvothermal method and the water-splitting activity of the resulting composite was evaluated under irradiation by visible light (λ > 420 nm) using Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrificial reagents. CdS composites with 1 wt% GO content exhibited H2 production rates that were 4.8 times higher than those obtained using CdS nanoparticles.196 Another study examined GO and Pt simultaneously loaded on CdS using a solvothermal method; under visible-light irradiation, the resulting CdS composites with 0.5 wt% Pt loaded on 1 wt% of GO using lactic acid as the sacrificial reagent achieved an H2 production 4.84 times higher than that of the Pt-loaded CdS.194 Loading Pt cocatalysts on GO–CdS composites was shown to significantly enhance the efficiency of H2 evolution. The GO–CdS composites were synthesized using a two-phase method. The 0.5 wt% Pt-loaded GO–CdS composites were 2.5 times more effective in catalyzing H2 evolution than GO–CdS under Hg lamp irradiation, using methanol as a sacrificial reagent.197 Nitrogen-doped graphene oxide (N-GO) has also been used as a supporting matrix for CdS.195 The rate of H2 evolution on N-GO (2 wt%)–CdS composites was 5 times greater than that of pure CdS under visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) using Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrificial reagents. Other GO-based photocatalysts, such as GO-metal oxides,200–203 GO-metal (oxy)nitrides,204,205 GO-metal sulfides,206 and GO–C3N4 (ref. 207), have also been synthesized to enable the high efficiency production of H2 from water.
A Z-scheme photocatalytic reaction is a two-photon absorption water-splitting reaction mimicking biological photosynthesis. The Z-scheme system contains an H2-evolving photocatalyst, an O2-evolving photocatalyst, and a reversible electron mediator that functions as an ionic redox couple, like Fe2+/Fe3+ or I−/IO3−, capable of achieving overall water splitting.208,209 GO is a promising solid-state redox mediator because of its high electron conductivity and its electron-accepting ability, making it a suitable replacement for common ionic redox couples.210,211 In the Z-scheme system shown in Fig. 19, a GO–BiVO4 composite, serving as an O2-evolving photocatalyst, is mixed with an H2-evolving Ru–StTiO3:Rh photocatalyst in an aqueous solution. Under visible light illumination, GO can shuttle photogenerated electrons from the BiVO4 to the Ru–StTiO3:Rh, recombining the majority carriers, and producing useful electron–hole pairs (minority carriers in BiVO4 and Ru–StTiO3:Rh) at the semiconductor–water interface to facilitate the water redox reaction into H2 and O2.

4.1.2. Mechanisms involved in electron transfer in GO. 
Cao et al. used time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate the picosecond ultrafast electron dynamic transfer between GO sheets and CdS particles in GO–CdS composites under light irradiation.212 They demonstrated the ability of GO to act as an electron acceptor capable of reducing the charge recombination rate in CdS photocatalysts. However, the mechanism involved in electron transfer in GO sheets remains unclear. Lightcap et al. used GO as a two-dimensional support and selectively anchored semiconductors and metal nanoparticles at separate sites.213 TiO2, GO, and silver ions were incorporated into the system. Under UV irradiation, the photogenerated electrons from TiO2 reduced the GO sheets and were simultaneously stored on the GO sheets. Furthermore, the stored electrons could be trapped following the addition of silver ions that were reduced into silver nanoparticles at a location distinct from the TiO2 anchored sites. This means that the electrons were trapped at many uncertain sites, which needed to be released by active sites or species. Dong et al. investigated the interfacial electron–hole separation mechanism of GO-supported CdS composites using DFT calculations.214 The photoexcited electrons in CdS particles are injected into GO, whereupon they are transported along the GO sheet through π* orbitals to achieve interfacial charge separation. As outlined in Section 2, many isolated sp2 domains, confined by the sp3 domains or disordered carbon atoms that provide quantum confinement in GO sheets, can accumulate photoexcited electrons.60 That is, additional metals or heteroatoms must be introduced to facilitate the extraction of trapped electrons.
Metallic Pt nanoparticles, with a work function (5.65 eV) greater than that of GO (4.66 eV), are deposited on GO to perform photocatalytic water splitting. The resulting Schottky barrier at the interface of GO and Pt particles promotes the transfer of trapped electrons to Pt nanoparticles. Therefore, the photoactivity of Pt-loaded GO-based composites is considerably higher than that of GO-based composites alone. Nitrogen doping techniques are another strategy for the extraction of trapped electrons from GO sheets. The additive nitrogen atoms create a pathway for the transference of trapped electrons from confined sp2 domains,117 whereupon the electrons reduce water into H2.

4.2. GO nanomaterials as photocatalysts for water splitting

4.2.1. GO photocatalysts. 
The VBM and CBM of graphene consist of π- and π*-orbitals, respectively. Following the oxygenation of graphene (i.e., producing GO), the VBM changes from the π-orbital of graphene to the O 2p orbital, whereas the CBM of GO remains in the π*-orbital. This means the bandgap of GO increases with oxidation. The increase in the oxidation level also alters the nature of the bandgap in graphene from direct to indirect.14 GO sheets have a large exposed area that enhances contact with water molecules and enables the tuning of their electronic structures through surface modification. GO photocatalysts with moderate oxidation levels have a bandgap of 2.4–4.3 eV, which is capable of stably catalyzing the evolution of H2 from an aqueous methanol solution under UV- or visible-light irradiation.215 Loading Pt cocatalysts does not promote the photoactivity of GO. The investigation into the PL mechanisms of GO by Jeon et al.72 indicated that a strong charge separation occurs at the boundary between sp2 and sp3 domains correlating to the direct–indirect gap transition, which is consistent with the results of photocatalytic H2 evolution in pure GO sheets.
Cocatalysts such as Pt, Ni, and NiO were loaded onto GO sheets to promote the photoactivity of GO.216–220 Agegnehu et al. deposited Ni and NiO cocatalysts onto GO sheets to enhance the photocatalytic activity of GO. Ni nanoparticles were deposited onto GO using NaBH4 to reduce the Ni precursor. NiO–GO composites can be obtained by further annealing the Ni–GO composites. Compared to bare GO, NiO–GO and Ni–GO composites enhanced the rate of H2 evolution under mercury-lamp irradiation from an aqueous methanol solution by approximately four and seven times, respectively. In the procedure of forming Ni-loaded GO composites, a large portion of the GO sheets was reduced because of the NaBH4 reducing reagent and the annealing process. As a result, the cocatalysts assisted in the extraction of photogenerated electrons instead of enhancing the charge separation at the boundary between sp2 and sp3 domains.
The photoactivity of GO with various oxidation levels was investigated by Yeh et al.221 Highly oxidized GO has a large bandgap that decreases light absorption, resulting in a reduction in the photocatalytic evolution of H2 from water, compared to the performance of GO, which has a lower oxidation level. However, only highly oxidized GO was able to catalyze O2 evolution under mercury-lamp irradiation in the presence of electron-scavenger Ag+ ions. This demonstrates that GO with a sufficiently high oxidation level is suitable for both the reduction and oxidation of water under mercury-lamp irradiation, in spite of the mutual reduction of GO leading to an upward shift in the VBM that results in a narrowing of the bandgap of GO.
Substitutional doping with group-V elements (e.g., N and P elements) into GO can enhance the photoactivity of pure GO because of the induced charge separation.222,223 Latorre-Sánchez et al. prepared P-doped GO (P-GO) through the pyrolysis of H2PO4−-modified alginate.222 The P-GO catalyzed H2 evolution at a rate of 12 μmol g−1 h−1 from an aqueous methanol solution under UV-visible light (Xe-lamp) irradiation, which is higher than that of GO (1.5 μmol g−1 h−1). Latorre-Sánchez et al. also prepared N-GO from biomass for use as a visible-light photocatalyst for H2 generation from water.223 After 3 hours of laser irradiation at 532 nm, the N-GO photocatalyst generated 55 μmol of H2 from an aqueous methanol solution. These results indicate that the presence of P and N atoms in GO increases its photocatalytic activity.
The tunable electronic properties of GO enhance its potential as a photocatalytic medium for photochemical reactions. As previously mentioned, graphene with amino or oxygen functionalities exhibits n-type or p-type conductivity.38 P-type conductivity hinders the hole transfer required for water oxidation and suppresses O2 evolution, whereas n-type conductivity hinders the injection of photogenerated electrons into the solution phase required for H2 evolution. GO is a p-doped semiconductor capable of stably catalyzing H2 evolution from an aqueous methanol solution under mercury-lamp irradiation.215 However, O2 evolution from the decomposition of water was not observed from GO with moderate oxidation, even in the presence of electron-scavenger Ag+ ions. Converting p-type GO into n-type GO by the introduction of amino and amide groups through an ammonia treatment at room temperature is a simple method to facilitate photocatalytic O2 evolution (Fig. 20(a)).224 GO and n-type GO were shown to steadily catalyze H2 evolution from an aqueous methanol solution under mercury-lamp irradiation (Fig. 20(b)). The amount of H2 evolved through the use of p-type GO was three times that obtained from n-type GO. Conversely, n-type GO was shown to catalyze the evolution of O2 from an AgNO3 aqueous solution under mercury-lamp irradiation (Fig. 20(c)). Furthermore, n-type GO simultaneously catalyzed the evolutions of H2 and O2 under visible light (λ > 420 nm) illumination, but with a H2/O2 molar ratio below 2. Experimental results show that the strategies for tuning conductivity in forms of GO can strongly affect the photocatalytic activity involved in the evolutions of H2 and O2.

The use of GO nanoparticles as photocatalysts to achieve overall water splitting is the ultimate goal in the application of solar energy. GO was shown to be a p-type semiconductor capable of injecting photogenerated electrons into water to promote the evolution of H2.215 The modification of GO by an ammonia treatment converted GO to an n-type semiconductor capable of facilitating hole injection for the oxidation of water to obtain O2.224 The size effect of sp2 domains resulting from quantum confinement was also shown to influence the electronic structures of GO.18 Thus, size modulation in conjunction with chemical modification represents an effective means of tuning the electronic properties of GO to achieve efficient water reduction and/or oxidation.46 According to the PL results in Section 2, the QYs of GOQDs are higher than those of GO sheets, which can be attributed to the effects of a reduced particle size causing a reduction in the mutual PL quenching between fluorescent domains. Reducing the size of the GO sheets may lower the probability of a recombination of the photogenerated charges.


4.2.2. GOQD photocatalysts. 
The physical and chemical characteristics of GO nanoparticles, including the tenability of conductivity and electronic structures, indicate that modified GO particles with lateral dimensions of less than 100 nm are suitable for overall water splitting. A study synthesized NGOQDs into a single particle with both n- and p-type conductivities, which were attributed to nitrogen and oxygen functionalities, respectively.225Fig. 21(a) presents the results of an electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis with the Mott–Schottky equation for identifying the type of conductivity associated with NGOQDs. The NGOQDs in Fig. 21(a) present concave plots similar to those associated with n- and p-type conductivities in semiconductors.226,227 These results indicate the coexistence of both n- and p-type conductivities in the NGOQDs.

The NGOQDs with both n- and p-type conductivities had a bandgap of 2.2 eV, which encompassed the energy levels required for water reduction and oxidation. This suggests that photocatalysts of NGOQDs are suitable for overall water splitting under visible-light irradiation.225 In one experiment, we used metal-free NGOQDs, comprising only carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, with pure water as the only reactant. Under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) on pure water suspending the NGOQDs, the products (H2 and O2) steadily evolved at an H2:O2 ratio of approximately 2:1 over a period of 72 hours, with no N2 evolution (Fig. 21(b)). The simultaneous evolution of H2 and O2 over NGOQDs, at a stoichiometric ratio, can be attributed to the formation of favorable bending in the diode system, which mimics the processes involved in biological photosynthesis.225 The intrinsic sp2 domains of NGOQDs serve as an interfacial junction between the n- and p-type domains, thereby creating charge recombination sites for the majority carriers of both n- and p-domains and promoting the minority carriers to perform water redox reactions at semiconductor–water interfaces (Fig. 21(c)). This vectorial charge displacement mechanism corresponds to the PL mechanisms characterized by transient spectroscopy, which exhibit strong charge separations in the vicinity of graphene-like states in GO.61
Yeh et al. reported the photocatalytic water-splitting performance of surface-intact NGOQDs (iNGOQDs), which are also based on the abundant elements C, H, O, and N.228 The synthesized iNGOQDs, when deposited with Pt as a cocatalyst, catalyzed H2 evolution from water containing triethanolamine (TEOA) at a QY of 12.8% under monochromatic light irradiation (420 nm). The activity of the iNGOQDs was among the highest of all photocatalyst types, including metal-containing materials. The high activity of the iNGOQDs was ascribed to the specific electronic properties of a p–n photochemical diode. An advantage of the iNGOQD photocatalysis was that the morphology and electronic structure of the iNGOQDs could be manipulated through simple nitridation and oxidation on graphene materials consisting of only C and H.


4.2.3. Stability of GO-based photocatalysts. 
The photocatalytic stability of GO-based materials is a concern in the current stage of research because GO materials in water might suffer from photocorrosion through self-oxidation by photoinduced holes, in which some CO2 evolves.229 This corrosion reaction may lead to formation of vacancy sites and defects on GO nanosheets, and the H2 evolution rate decreased with increase in the irradiation time. By contrast, steady generation of H2 occurred when GO was dispersed in a methanol aqueous solution under irradiation.215 Reduction of GO occurred because methanol acted as a strong hole scavenger. The reduction was transient and the GO quickly became stabilized under irradiation. Previous studies reported the reduction of GO by electrons induced in other photocatalysts, such as TiO2 (ref. 187) and CdS,195 under light irradiation. The reduced GO formed linkages with the photocatalysts and stabilized them by trapping the photoinduced electrons. These strategies effectively improved the stability of the photocatalytic reaction system.
In ref. 228, Pt-loaded iNGOQDs suspended in a TEOA aqueous solution steadily generated H2 under visible light irradiation for about 4 days, thereafter decay took place, attributable to the Pt cocatalyst accelerating the electron transfer and damaging the QDs. When combined with GO sheets, iNGOQDs exhibited improved stability in the same photocatalytic system.230 Further design of the framework and electronic structure in GO-based composites to exploit GO sheets for electron trapping is expected to prolong the lifespan of a photocatalytic system.

5. Conclusions and outlook
This review introduced GO-based materials as the media for photoenergy conversion from the perspective of PL, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis. The oxygen functional groups on GO nanoparticles provide opportunities to tailor chemical functionalities and tune the electronic properties. The unique heterogeneous electronic properties of GO, resulting from the presence of sp2 and sp3 domains, have been demonstrated in the time-resolved spectroscopic measurement of ultrafast carrier dynamics as well as from the results of tuning the surface chemistry. Tuning the surface chemistry by tailoring the oxidation levels, modifying the surface of GO, and implementing the substitutional doping of GO, demonstrated that sp2 and sp3 domains emit PL of short and long wavelengths, respectively. The ultrafast dynamics in time-resolved spectroscopic measurements illustrated the coexistence of sp2 and sp3 domains and the competing PL emissions between them. sp2 domain-derived PL emissions are bright and have short lifetimes, indicating that sp2 domains are favorable sites for charge recombination.
Except for the QYs, the properties of GOQDs are inherited from the GO, although various strategies have been developed for tuning the surface chemistry with various electronic properties. The QYs of GOQDs are higher than those of GO because of the suppression of mutual quenching in the active domains of GOQDs. Additional chemical processing and modification could further reduce the competing pathway between radiative and nonradiative recombination. A combination of theoretical calculations and experimental results indicated that bandgap is not dependent on the size of the particles, but rather on the sp2 and sp3 domains in GOQDs.
GOQDs possess accessible triplet states resulting from the edge effect. Triplet excited states have significantly longer lifetimes and tend to have longer diffusion lengths. In addition to a high extinction coefficient, tunable bandgap, and homogeneous size distribution, GOQDs synthesized by stepwise solution processes are suitable as sensitizers for solar energy conversion, with efficiency comparable to that of some metal-based quantum-dot sensitized solar cells. GOQDs prepared by top-down techniques are still somewhat low in efficiency when serving as sensitizers in optoelectronics, because of factors such as a large size distribution and the arrangement of pores.
GO sheets can act as photocatalysts or electron acceptors, depending on their oxidation levels. GO sheets with a low oxidation level function as substrates for charge separation by trapping photogenerated electrons from metal-based photocatalysts. Further deposition of cocatalysts on GO sheets can help extract the accumulated electrons for the reduction of water in the evolution of H2. GO with moderate oxidation levels can function as photocatalysts for water decomposition. Oxygen-bonded carbon atoms are capable of dissociating excitons, thereby providing active sites for H2 evolution. Cocatalysts such as Ni and Pt enhance H2 evolution over a reduced GO that contains less oxygen functionalities. Modifying GO with ammonia can switch the conductivity from p-type to n-type, resulting in dominant O2 evolution. n-Type GO is capable of simultaneously catalyzing the evolutions of H2 and O2 in a stoichiometric ratio different from water under visible-light irradiation. These results indicate that the types of functionalities on GO strongly influence the results associated with water splitting.
Tuning the electronic properties of GO through a combination of size modulation and chemical doping can achieve overall water splitting. Suspending NGOQDs with n- and p-type domains in pure water can achieve the evolution of H2 and O2 at a molar ratio of 2:1. A photochemical diode-type mechanism for water splitting over NGOQDs uncovers numerous opportunities for the design of graphene semiconductor architectures capable of mimicking the vectorial charge displacement found in biological photosynthesis. Furthermore, NGOQDs consist of only C, H, O, and N, which clearly indicates that graphene-based photocatalysts could achieve the photosynthetic generation of H2 through water splitting in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner.
The charge transfer mechanisms in PL, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis for photoenergy conversion can be attributed to intrinsic sp2 domains and disordered sp3 domains. Intrinsic sp2 domains are induced by the size effect. A major factor involved in the manipulation of the electronic structure of disordered sp3 domains is the type of functionalities. The PL lifetime associated with intrinsic sp2 domains is shorter than that of disordered sp3 domains; by contrast, a long lifetime of electrons is required for photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Therefore, the precise control of sp2 domains to ensure that they are identical in size is crucial to achieving monochromatic emissions. The modification of GO nanoparticles using various functionalities can be used to tailor the sp2 domain size. In this way, the electronic structures can be tuned to alter the intrinsic bandgaps of sp2 domains in the creation of various emission colors. High QYs could then be obtained through surface modifications to promote the passivation of nonradiative sites.
Disordered sp3 domains drive the photoenergy conversion in photovoltaics and the photocatalysis involved in water splitting, because the charge separation among the sp2 and sp3 domains or the triplet states at the edges leads to long electron lifetimes. Designing and engineering the electronic structures on the active surface of GO nanoparticles by changing the quantity and types of functionalities is essential to photocatalytic water splitting and photovoltaics. Currently, the photoenergy conversion efficiency in photocatalysis and photovoltaics remains low. GO nanoparticles with multiple functionalities, such as electron-donating and electron-accepting functionalities, can efficiently separate excitons and further stabilize photoexcited electrons, and represent a means of promoting photoenergy conversion in the production of solar fuels and electric power.
Further understanding the mechanisms involved in electron–hole pair generation and disappearance is the essential task for efficient photoenergy conversion. Previous studies have demonstrated that the PL emissions are associated with intrinsic sp2 and/or disordered sp3 domains. Further investigations on the transport dynamics of charges separated at the sp2–sp3 domain interface and the influence of structural defects on transportation are required. The first challenge for enhancing PL efficiency is to develop a synthesis route for GO nanomaterials containing intact sp2 domains that minimize the probability of non-radiative charge recombination. The second challenge is the precise control of oxygen functionalities on the GO nanomaterials, therefore designing architectures for efficient electron–hole separation. Tuning the quantities and types of functionalities can effectively regulate the charge separation rate. For example, a combination of electron-accepting and electron-donating functionalities to create a bipolar property in GO may substantially enhance charge separation. For photocatalysis or photovoltaics, creation or deposition of electron and/or hole sinks on the surface of GO materials is essential for further interaction of the charges with the chemical species in the fluid phase. By coupling with appropriate electron and/or hole sinks, GO materials of high PL efficiency can be converted to powerful photocatalytic or photovoltaic materials. Further unraveling the charge transport mechanism in GO can be accomplished by the elaborate integration of analyses on PL, photovoltaic and photocatalysis measurement results. The above directions of further investigation underlie foundations for GO to serve as a platform material for highly efficient photoenergy conversion.

 	Fig. 5  Transient differential transmission spectra of SGO, FGO1, and FGO2 in dimethylformamide solutions as a function of pump-probe delay at the pump intensities of 5.2 GW cm−2 ((a), (c), (e)) and 411 GW cm−2 ((b), (d), (f)). The insets of parts (a), (c), and (e) are schematics of the structural morphology of SGO, FGO1, and FGO2, where the gray and white regions represent the sp2 domains and sp3 domains, respectively. In the insets of (b) and (d), the differential transmission curves are magnified around zero delays. The solid lines are fits based on the model described in the text, which includes both sp2 and sp3 domain contributions to the optical response. (g) Schematic drawing of the transient absorption in the sp2 and sp3 domains. SA is saturable absorption and TPA is two-photon absorption. The incident excitation induces a positive transient differential transmission in the sp2 domains because of SA, and a negative transient differential transmission in the sp3 domains because of TPA. The insets are the bandgap structures of the sp2 (left) and sp3 domains (right). The bottom shows that the combination of the transient differential transmissions corresponds to the sp2 and sp3 domains, respectively. Reproduced with permission from ref. 69.

 	Fig. 6  (a) Energy gap of p–p* transitions calculated according to DFT as a function of the number of fused aromatic rings (N). The inset shows the structures of the graphene molecules used for the calculation. Parts (b–d) depict the structural models of GO at different stages of reduction. The larger sp2 clusters of aromatic rings are not drawn to scale. The smaller sp2 domains indicated by jagged lines do not necessarily correspond to any specific structure (for example, olefinic chains) but rather to small and localized sp2 configurations that act as luminescence centers. The PL intensity is relatively weak for (b) as-synthesized GO but increases with reduction because of (c) the formation of additional small sp2 domains between the larger clusters caused by the evolution of oxygen with reduction. After extensive reduction, the smaller sp2 domains created (d) percolating pathways among the larger clusters. (e) Representative band structure of GO. The energy levels are quantized with a large energy gap for small fragments caused by confinement. A photogenerated e–h pair recombining radiatively is depicted.

 	Fig. 8  Schematic illustration of the PL emission mechanism. The emission is composed of two parts, the defect state (left side) and the localized energy levels caused by the size effect of sp2 clusters (right side). (a) For rGO, the blue emission from the defect state is predominant (wide arrow). (b) For functionalized rGO, an explanation for the enhanced PL is presented. A new excitation process appears and the excitation of sp2 clusters themselves is improved by resonant energy transfer. Reproduced with permission from ref. 58. Copyright 2013 Wiley-VCH.

 	Fig. 16  Principle of operation and energy level scheme of the dye-sensitized solar cell. Photoexcitation of the sensitizer (S) is followed by electron injection into the conduction band of an oxide semiconductor film. The dye molecule is regenerated by the redox system, which is itself regenerated at the counter-electrode by electrons passing through the load. Potentials are referred to the normal hydrogen electrode. The open circuit voltage of the solar cell corresponds to the difference between the redox potential of the mediator and the Fermi level of the nanocrystalline film that is indicated with a dashed line. The energy levels drawn for the sensitizer and the redox mediator match the redox potentials of the doubly deprotonated N3 sensitizer ground state and the iodide or triiodide couple.
