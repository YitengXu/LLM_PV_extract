1. Introduction
Currently, energy production, energy storage, and global warming are hot topics in society. To address these challenges, caused by the incompatibility between the demand for fossil fuels (such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas) and maintaining a sustainable environment, a variety of efficient and advanced solutions have been suggested.1–4 It is necessary to develop high-powered, green energy-storage technologies, including supercapacitors and batteries, to effectively utilize renewable and sustainable energy resources.3,5–15,315–321 Among the various energy-storage technologies, supercapacitors have attracted extensive attention in recent years because of their high power density, outstanding cycle stability, and fast charge–discharge characteristics.16,17 Moreover, with the development of nanotechnology, nanostructures have been a key focus of research, particularly in the field of electrochemical energy storage. Previous research suggests that the size effects of nanostructures improves, to some extent, the kinetics and thermodynamics of electrochemical reactions.18–21 Since the groundbreaking discovery of carbon nanotubes in the 1990s, 1D nanostructures have attracted significant research interest because of their remarkable physical/chemical properties and their great potential in nanotechnology applications.22–27 In particular, 1D nanostructures can provide direct current pathways, shorten the ion diffusion distance, lower the charge–discharge time, increase the electrolyte–electrode contact area, limit mechanical degradation, and accommodate volume expansion. 1D nanostructures have one singular nanostructure, and the main types of 1D homostructures include nanowires,19,28–30 nanorods,31,32 nanotubes,33 and nanobelts.34 Furthermore, unlike typical 1D nanostructures, 1D-analogue nanostructures, also known as 1D heteronanostructures, consist of multiple components. The types of 1D-analogue nanostructures include core–shell nanostructures,35 array architectures,36–38 branched nanowires,34 hollow nanostructure,39–44 and fiber structures.4 Specifically, Mai's group summarized recent advances in porous 1D nanostructures, which exhibit a number of advantages for the field of electrochemical energy storage.45 The synergistic effects between each component endow heterostructured electrodes with better electrical conductivity, greater electrochemical cycle stability and reversibility, faster ion transport, improved mechanical stability, etc.
Supercapacitors are promising energy-storage devices due to their extraordinary long lifespan (1000–20000 cycles), and high safety, power density (>163 W kg−1), and pulse charge/discharge rate.46 In general, there are two types of supercapacitors, classified according to the charge-storage mechanism: electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and Faraday pseudocapacitors. EDLC electrode materials are based on carbon materials,24,25,47–50 and store charge on the electrode surface. The active electrode material for pseudocapacitors includes TMOs (e.g., TiO2,5 V2O5,51 MnO2,52 Fe2O3,53 Co3O4,54etc.), conducting polymers (e.g., polyaniline “PANI”, polypyrrole, etc.), and composite materials (e.g., NiCo2O4,55 NixCo3xO4,56 V2O5/MnO2 core–shell nanotubes,57 V2O5–PANI nanowires,58etc.), which store charge through a reversible faradaic redox reaction at the surface. Furthermore, to meet the increasing demand for practical energy-storage applications, it is necessary to further enhance the operating voltage and energy density of supercapacitors.59–61 According to the equation E = 1/2CV2, the energy density (E) of a capacitor can be greatly improved by increasing the cell voltage (V) or device capacitance (C).62–64 At present, all-solid-state, flexible asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) are one of the hottest topics in energy-storage research due to their extraordinary cycle lifetimes and exceptionally fast charge–discharge abilities.
Previous reviews have provided excellent summaries of metal oxides and energy-storage devices with 1D nanostructures.15,65–71 Nevertheless, recent research progress, especially into new types of supercapacitors, necessitates a review of the recent challenges and an update of the current status of advanced supercapacitors with 1D TMOs. Consequently, in this review, first we systematically summarize the synthetic methods of TMOs based on 1D nanomaterials. Subsequently, the design and optimization of electrode materials are carefully discussed, followed by a discussion on the influence of the structure on the electrochemical performance. Finally, conclusions and future perspectives to develop supercapacitors with high performance are given. Notably, with societal development, the advancement of technology, and the proliferation of portable electronics, flexible, wearable, and lightweight electronics are highly favored by the majority of scientists for their potential applications, such in as distributed sensors and artificial electronic skin. Consequently, the development of biomimetic,72–75 biocompatible,76,77 flexible,78–81 wearable,82 lightweight,83 renewable-biomolecule-based,84 and more highly efficient energy technology or multidimensional device architectures for future hybrid energy storage is imminent.
2. Controlled synthesis of 1D/1D-analogue TMO nanostructures

Fig. 1 shows the d-block and ds-block main parts of the periodic table of elements. The synthesis of 1D TMO nanostructures includes both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Representative bottom-up routes, including various vapor-based approaches and solution-based synthetic approaches, have been studied extensively (Fig. 2). An integrated overview of the synthetic methods for 1D TMOs is presented in this section.

 Fig. 2  Summary of the four major type preparation methods: vapor-based approaches, solution-based preparation, template methods and other preparative strategy. 
2.1. Vapor-based approaches
Vapor deposition is usually conducted under high temperature and in vacuum. This method has several advantages over wet chemistry processes: first, control of the dimension, composition, organization, and location of 1D nanomaterials can be achieved by vapor deposition methods via engineering growth sites, catalysts, or precursors. Second, the deposition conditions, namely high vacuum and high temperature, allow for obtaining highly crystalline metallic oxide nanowires. However, currently, vapor deposition approaches are associated with small scale and high cost. This subsection describes several, typical vapor-based approaches for 1D nanostructure growth.

2.1.1. Vapor–liquid–solid. 
Vapor–liquid–solid refers to a growth mechanism in which the material is directly absorbed via liquid catalysts during crystal growth. In the vapor–liquid–solid method, the 1D nanostructure is developed by solid precipitation from disperse, supersaturated catalyst droplets.
Titanium dioxide is a very promising material for various applications, including, for example, supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, dye-sensitized solar cells, and water splitting systems, and there are various methods to synthesize TiO2 nanostructures. However, intentionally controlling the spatial location and range of the length/diameter seems to be unfeasible with other common methods. Therefore, the position- and size-controlled vapor–liquid–solid method for synthesizing nanowires is a solution to overcome the above issues. Nevertheless, creating a TiO2 single-crystal nanowire by the vapor–liquid–solid mechanism is a challenging issue because of the difficulty in understanding and controlling the complex nanomaterial transport events across the three phases. Experiments have demonstrated that the vapor–liquid–solid growth of 1D TiO2 structures can emerge consistently only within a quite narrow range of material flux.85 This phenomenon distinctly contrasts that of typical vapor–liquid–solid metal oxides, such as ZnO, In2O3, SnO2, and MgO, whose metal oxide nanowires are easily grown by the vapor–liquid–solid mechanism with much wider ranges of material flux. Moreover, experimental results have shown that rutile TiO2 nanowires primarily grow along the (001) direction, which differs from the usual (001)-oriented growth of TiO2 nanowires formed by vapor-phase processes. This method, based on the control of material flux, is a reasonable strategy to tailor TiO2 nanowires using the vapor–liquid–solid mechanism.
The growth of 1D metal oxides can be achieved through electron-beam evaporation processes.86 Most metal oxides are easily resolved by the condensed electron-beam method. As can be seen in Fig. 3A and B, the TMO source is decomposed by a condensed electron-beam, consequently creating a nanodot of a self-catalytic metal for vapor–liquid–solid growth. Thereby, 1D metal oxides can be grown at a temperature above their melting point to achieve self-catalysis via dissolved oxygen. Furthermore, the morphology of the 1D nanostructures, including the uniformity and density, depends on the surface migration energy and surface energy of the substrate.

2.1.2. Physical/chemical vapor deposition. 
Chemical vapor deposition is an approach in which a material reacts on the surface of a special substrate or in which vaporized precursors decompose to form typical 1D solid materials. The precursor material is carried via an inert gas, and the reaction occurs in a vacuum chamber. If there are chemical reactions involved in the process of vapor deposition, the approach is called chemical vapor deposition; the converse is physical vapor deposition. Chemical vapor deposition techniques include hot filament, microwave plasma, atmospheric pressure, thermal, photo-assisted, plasma-enhanced, and low temperature chemical vapor deposition.
A universal schematic has been reported to show the primary influencing factors in the catalyst-assisted growth of ZnO nanowires and the formation of vapor–solid materials. The different influencing factors on the growth of ZnO nanowires have been discussed in detail. Various parameters, such as the reaction gas and carrier flow, the substrate, and the powder temperature, were presented in selected shape diagrams,87 where, most importantly, one can identify typical parameter ranges for vapor–solid growth, film formation, and catalyst-assisted vapor–liquid–solid growth using these shape diagrams. In particular, experiments also demonstrated the controlled growth of catalyst-assisted and vapor–solid ZnO nanowires in a chemical vapor deposition reactor via the carbothermal reduction process based on either downstream or upstream deposition techniques.


2.1.3. Atomic-layer deposition. 
Atomic-layer deposition is a cycled, self-limited chemical vapor deposition process involving separate precursors via separate precursor pulses. This method is usually used to synthesize conformal thin films and to control the film thickness down to the nanometer level.88
Understanding the evolution and formation of crystalline and amorphous phases by atomic-layer deposition is necessary in order to create high-quality, multifunctional dielectric coatings/films and to predict the surface functionalization.89 The integrated, atomistic electron microscopy research of TiO2 structures at designed growth cycles during atomic-layer deposition has elucidated a number of transformation sequences and different atom arrangement processes during TiO2 atomic-layer deposition growth. The evolution of TiO2 structures during atomic-layer deposition was revealed by following the transformation from amorphous layers to amorphous particles to metastable crystallites and finally to stable crystalline forms. These changes were attributed to the Ostwald–Lussac law, which controls the ratio and sequence of the disparate phases of the TiO2 nanostructures during the relatively high-temperature atomic-layer deposition. Moreover, the crystalline and amorphous mixture enabled specific anisotropic crystal growth at a relatively high temperature, forming TiO2 nanorods by a vapor-phase-oriented attachment mechanism.


2.1.4. Pulsed-laser deposition. 
Pulsed-laser deposition is a physical vapor deposition approach, which uses a pulsed, high-power laser beam as the heating source. Complex oxide materials have various excellent features, including superconducting,90 piezoelectric,91 and ferroelectric92 properties, and have been widely applied in electronic devices for advanced energy technologies, such as sensors, memory, and nonvolatile micromotors.93 Lead–zirconium–titanium is the most promising complex oxide material because of its excellent piezoelectric coefficient, high dielectric constant, and large hysteresis. There are various synthetic approaches to fabricating this material, such as electrophoresis,94 hydrothermal synthesis,95 and template infiltration.96
Work on the growth of PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 tapered nanowire arrays by the pulsed-laser deposition method suggests that the stoichiometry can be controlled by a relatively low-temperature process.97 Single-crystal PbZr0.2Ti0.8 tapered nanowire arrays were successfully synthesized on a SrTiO3 substrate by a pulsed-laser deposition process. The unique tapered morphology of the nanowires was attributed to the excess coating of the PbZr0.2Ti0.8 layer by the lateral growth of PbZr0.2Ti0.8 adatoms during the PbZr0.2Ti0.8 nanowire growth process. The growth conditions for the PbZr0.2Ti0.8 nanowires were studied at different pressures and temperatures. The experiment also demonstrated that the tapered PbZr0.2Ti0.8 nanowires underwent a Frank–van der Merwe growth mechanism, after the formation of 3D islands by a Stranski–Krastanov growth mechanism, followed by axial growth on the lowest energy [001] crystal face via a vapor–solid mechanism. Nevertheless, under special conditions, such as specific substrate temperatures (<725 °C and >850 °C) or lower or higher pressures (<200 or >400 mTorr), the formation of PbZr0.2Ti0.8 nanowires was suppressed, while PbZr0.2Ti0.8 thin film grown by a layer-by-layer mechanism remained. Most importantly, the direction of PbZr0.2Ti0.8 nanowire array growth could be controlled along the (001), (110), and (111) crystal faces of the SrTiO3 substrate.


2.1.5. Carbothermal reduction. 
Carbothermal reduction is a facile approach for the synthesis of 1D materials, particularly TMO-functionalized nanostructures. Various nanomaterials for energy applications, including LiFePO4, MnO2, and ZnO, have been synthesized by carbothermal reduction. Additionally, this method is compatible with industry because of its use of low-cost precursor materials. The oxide reduction mechanism by gaseous intermediates, such as CO2 and CO, follows formulas (1) and (2): MO (s) + CO (g) → M (s) + CO2 (g)(1) CO2 (g) + C (s) → 2CO (g)(2)
For instance, metal oxide reduction by gaseous metal carbides can occur through the reaction of carbon and metal vapor, as in formulas (3) and (4): 2MO (s) + MC2 (g) → 3M (s) + 2CO (g)(3) M (s) + 2C (s) → MC2 (g)(4)
Then, thermal reduction by H2O and H2 gaseous intermediates follows, as in formulas (5)–(7): MO (s) + H2 (g) → M (s) + H2O (g)(5) C (s) + H2O (g) → H2 (g) + CO (g)(6) MO (s) + C (s) →M (s) + CO (g)(7)
Cu2O nanostructures have received attention for their potential use in different applications, such as energy storage,98,99 water splitting,100 gas sensing,101 solar energy conversion, and the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants,102 The unique aligned nanowire structure can afford inherently efficient architectures with increased surface area for charge-transfer processes, minimized hole and electron diffusion lengths, and an increased superficial area for charge transfer in charge-collecting electrodes.103,104 Accordingly, vertically aligned Cu2O nanowires can observably diversify and enhance the portfolio of Cu2O-based nanostructure applications.105 Many synthetic methods for obtaining Cu2O nanowires have been proposed. For instance, distributed single-crystal Cu2O nanowire arrays with a diameter of approximately 300 nm and a length of over 20 μm have been synthesized by hydrothermal processes.106,107 High-density Cu2O nanowires (approximately 200 nm) have been synthesized using porous nanotemplates by electrochemical techniques; however, the length was limited to 4 μm due to diffusion-restricted electrolyte transport in the confined nanopores. Cu2O nanowire arrays have been fabricated by the facile carbothermal reduction of CuO nanowires, whereby the CuO nanowires were first obtained by the thermal oxidation of copper foils, and then the oxidation of 26 μm copper foils at 700 °C for 10 h converted all the substrate to phase-pure cupric oxide. Two significant effects were observed when the transformation was initiated at a temperature of 350 °C. First and foremost, the CuO → Cu2O reduction reaction occurs via the diffusion of O2 under a reducing atmosphere provided by the existence of CO. Additionally, the Cu2O nanowires were observed as periodic aggregations, which were probably driven by Rayleigh instability during the phase transformation.

2.2. Solution-based preparations
Solution-based processes have been widely used for the growth of 1D nanostructures because of their large-scale production, simple processing, low cost, size controllability, good scalability, and excellent dispersion. Nevertheless, the growth orientation and crystal structure of 1D nanostructures are not easily controlled in solution-based routes.109–111

2.2.1. Hydrothermal/solvothermal methods. 
The hydrothermal/solvothermal route describes a synthetic strategy that relies on the solubility of the metallic oxide material under high pressure and temperature to synthesize 1D crystalline substances.112 This synthetic method is usually implemented in autoclaves. A supercritical fluid is formed under elevated pressure and temperature, which increases the solubility of the solid precursors and leads to the precipitation of 1D nanostructures from the excess inorganic precursor. Hydrothermal processes are efficient for the development of high-quality 1D nanocrystals with high orientation and few defects. We will describe these methods in greater detail in the following sections. Many nanostructures have been prepared by hydrothermal methods, including MnO2,113–115 Na2V6O16·3H2O,116 Ag2V4O11,117,118 VO2,119–121 Ag4V2O6,122,123 and WO3.124
The one-step fabrication of hybrid nanostructures with a high conductance and surface area remains a challenge.108 Based on the theoretical Kirkendall effect, Ag/MnOx nanotubes were produced by the solvothermal reaction between KMnO4 and Ag nanowire templates. The electrochemical performance and morphology of the Ag/MnOx composite material were tuned by changing the pH level. Tubular MnOx nanosheets with Ag nanoparticles were formed in a comparatively acidic environment (pH = 0.76), whereas ultrafine Ag nanoparticles entrapped in amorphous manganese dioxide nanotubes were prepared in neutral solution (pH = 7.00) (Fig. 3C). Various volume-dependent experiments demonstrated that the Kirkendall effect was involved in the production of these morphologies (Fig. 3D). Additionally, the tubular Ag/MnOx hierarchical nanostructures showed a high electrochemical performance and maintained 80% of their initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1. Most importantly, this synthetic mechanism may provide feasible design guidelines for the preparation of other hierarchical 1D TMO nanocomposites.


2.2.2. Coprecipitation method. 
There are three primary mechanisms of coprecipitation: occlusion, adsorption, and inclusion. Impurities can be adsorbed via weak bonding to the surface of the precipitate, whereby impurities physically trapped in the crystal lead to occlusions as the crystal grows.
Ma et al. reported the growth mechanism of Ag/Fe3O4 core–shell nanowires. They synthesized 1D Ag/Fe3O4 core–shell heteronanowires by an effective and facile coprecipitation method.125 The Ag nanowires acted as nucleation sites for the growth of ferriferous oxide in aqueous solution. The controlling factors affecting the morphology and size of the core–shell nanowires included the poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) concentration, the FeCl3/FeCl2 concentration, time, and the reaction temperature. The results showed that the thickness of the Fe3O4 shell could be tuned from 6 to 76 nm and that the morphology could be varied between nanorods and nanospheres. First and foremost, nucleation points were added to the surface of the Ag nanowires by the CO moieties of PVP. The accumulation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ on the Ag nanowire surface was then promoted by an in situ oxidation reaction between FeCl3/FeCl2 and the Ag nanowire solution. Additionally, the Ag nanowire surface was attached to the nucleus of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Finally, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles grew from the Ag nanowire surface. Higher temperature or a higher FeCl3/FeCl2 concentration resulted in a faster growth or nucleation, while a lower temperature or lower concentration led to a slower growth or nucleation, causing the formation of Fe3O4 nanospheres. Moreover, the Ag–Fe3O4 core–shell nanowires exhibited good ferromagnetic and electrical properties at room temperature.


2.2.3. Microwave-assisted method. 
The microwave-assisted method provides heating during the synthetic process, which allows reducing the reaction time for inorganic and organic materials through control of the reaction kinetics.126,127 Moreover, the use of microwaves provides a progressive heating pattern, which is effective for the synthesis of typical colloidal nanomaterials.128 The microwave-assisted route can control the shape of a nanomaterial because it stimulates ionic motion, molecular dipolar polarization, faster reaction kinetics, and rapid precursor dissolution.
Tang et al. successfully synthesized vertically aligned ZnO nanorods by using both a conventional heated water bath and microwave processes at 90 °C on a silicon (100) substrate with a ZnO nanoparticle seed-layer coating.129 The optical properties, defects, and morphologies of the ZnO nanorods fabricated by the two processes (pH = 10.07–10.9) were revealed by photoluminescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The experiments demonstrated that the microwave-assisted method produced more symmetrical nanorods with fewer native defects, such as zinc vacancies and oxygen interstitials. Thus, microwave-assisted synthesis was shown to be a promising approach for fabricating 1D metal oxide nanostructures.


2.2.4. Sol–gel method. 
The sol–gel approach is generally used to synthesize organic–inorganic hybrid materials or inorganic nanomaterials. Sol–gel methods include the gel of gelatinized colloidal solutions and the sol of colloidal solutions in the liquid phase. In the sol–gel approach, the sol is a colloidal suspension prepared by mixing water with inorganic metal salts or metal organic compounds. The sol undergoes polymerization and hydrolysis reactions, converting the liquid sol into a gel with a 3D network. The gel has a solid skeleton surrounded by an encapsulating liquid phase.
α-MoO3 nanorods have been fabricated by a facile sol–gel route.130 The growth mechanism was controlled by the decomposition rate of citric acid. Single-crystal and single-phase MoO3 nanorod arrays were grown in stochastic directions from a transparent silica glass substrate with a mean length and diameter of 500 and 10 nm, respectively. Moreover, the decomposition rate of citric acid plays a significant role in the growth of MoO3 nanorods, determined from examining the molar ratio of citric acid and molybdate in the precursor. Additionally, the timing of citric acid dissociation was controlled by the solvent and by sintering, which also influences the phase transition and growth of nanorods, as revealed by X-ray diffraction and SEM. Additionally, the synthetic parameters of the α-MoO3 nanorod arrays were optimized to control the density and length. The longest α-MoO3 nanorod length of 600 nm was achieved by sintering at 673 K for 15 min using a molar ratio of citric acid to Mo of 1.5:0.5 and dimethylacetamide as the solvent. Furthermore, the experiment also demonstrated that factors influencing the phase change and growth of the MoO3 nanorods are correlated to the dissociation of the citric acid/Mo metal compound in the sol–gel precursor liquor.

2.3. Template methods
The templating technique is significant for the facile construction of promising materials with controlled microstructures/nanostructures and desired functions.131 Different hard templates with channel or porous structures, such as MCM-41 silica and anodized alumina membranes, have been extensively explored for the synthesis of nanotubes and nanorods. At the same time, various soft templates, such as block copolymers and surfactants, primary function as a structure-directing assembly for the reacting species. Moreover, these templates offer advantages in terms of designing wire-like, porous, and sphere-like nanostructures. At present, another type of soft template, i.e., biological templates including DNA, virus particles, bacterium, etc., has been used to produce unique nanostructures and to deposit nanoparticles.

2.3.1. AAO templating. 
Hierarchical manganese dioxide nanowire–nanofibril arrays have been fabricated on an anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) template.132 A conformal layer of manganese dioxide nanofibrils was evenly grown on the surface of single manganese dioxide nanowires. The synthetic mechanism of the hierarchical manganese dioxide nanostructures was characterized by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), electrochemical measurements, electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The charge-storage mechanism of this complex nanomaterial was investigated in different solvents at slow scan rates. For instance, in acetonitrile electrolyte, the MnO2 nanofibrils exhibited capacitance due to cation insertion, while in aqueous electrolytes, the MnO2 nanofibrils exhibited capacitance due to surface adsorption and double-layer processes. This compound nanostructure exhibited a high capacitance of 174 F g−1 at 250 mV s−1 and 298 F g−1 at 50 mV s−1 in aqueous solution. Moreover, the material also showed stable cycling with 85.2% retention after 1000 cycles. Additionally, the MnO2 nanofibrils exhibited controllable parameters, including the nanowire diameter, the amount of nanofibril material, and the nanowire length.


2.3.2. Biological templating. 
In recent years, the bioinspired and biomimetic synthesis of nanostructures has drawn increasing attention. Bionanotechnology is a facile strategy to manufacture different metallic oxide nanomaterials with precise control over their morphology, crystal structure, and chemical composition by means of the use of natural bioassemblies and genetic engineering. The biological templating includes Bacillus subtilis/Gram-positive bacteria templating, tobacco mosaic virus templating, fungal biomineralization templating, and M13 virus templating.
Bacteria templating is promising for the generation of various inorganic micro/nanostructures, through the appropriate combination of typical chemical techniques without rigorous genetic engineering.133 These micro/nanostructures could possibly be used for the large-scale and facile production of functional micro/nanomaterials. A high-yield and simple biomineralization process using Bacillus subtilis, a Gram-positive bacterium, as a soft template was reported to produce Co3O4 nanostructures. Rod-type cobalt oxide was synthesized at room temperature via electrostatic interactions between cobalt ions and the surface structures of the bacteria in aqueous solution. Porous Co3O4 hollow rods were prepared by successive heat treatment at 300 °C. Moreover, the rods showed outstanding electrochemical performance and had a high surface area. This inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and facile synthetic method for TMOs with peculiar nanostructures can be used in a number of practical applications, such as supercapacitors, catalysts, sensors, and batteries.
Biomineralization is a process utilized by organisms to produce composite structures composed of inorganic and organic materials that usually show exceptional properties. Organic molecules, including polysaccharides, peptides, and proteins, indirectly guide nanocrystal growth under different ambient conditions and ultimately determine the functional properties and morphology of the materials.134,135 ZnO nanowires with high surface-to-volume ratios are especially attractive.136 The extraordinary rod-like morphology of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) makes it an appropriate scaffold for the manufacture of 1D wire-like structures. Balci et al. successfully synthesized TMV nanorods coated with ZnO and Pd by electroless deposition. Additionally, these nanocomposites were applied in TMV-based biological and chemical sensing applications, digital device memories, and energy-storage devices.137–139 Atanasova et al. successfully synthesized TMV-ZnO nanowires by a biotemplating mineralization process using a TMV template at low temperature. Furthermore, they provided an advanced method for the miniaturization and functionalization of devices using single TMV nanostructures as templates. In particular, the genetic modification of TMV provided methods for inducing the deposition of ZnO nanostructures, thus enhancing the field-effect transistor performance.140 Thus, the skillful design of TMV mutants can be applied to the deposition of other inorganic functional nanomaterials.
Novel bio-electrode materials were successfully synthesized by a fungal manganese biomineralization process for the first time.141 The synthesis of bio-electrode materials by fungal manganese biomineralization is shown in Fig. 4A. Further electrochemical tests showed that the carbonized fungal biomass-mineral electrode material had a fundamental specific capacitance of over 350 F g−1 in a supercapacitor and cycling stability with over 90% capacitor retention after 200 cycles in a lithium-ion battery. Most importantly, the research provided an advanced biotechnological method for the production of sustainable bio-electrochemical materials.

Composite TMO nanowires were rationally designed and synthesized by an M13 virus-guidance process.142 Among the various types of representative organic templates for nanomaterial synthesis, M13 viruses have special properties, such as the genetic tunability of helically arranged primary coat proteins and a high aspect ratio structure (diameter of approximately 6 nm and length of approximately 880 nm, as shown in Fig. 4B). Three unique spinel oxide nanowires of MnxCo3−xO4 (x = 0, 1, 2) were templated from the M13 virus by using a two-step reaction. From the heterogeneous nanowires in Fig. 4B, three-dimensional (3D) bio-composite nanowires with a length of 1 μm and a diameter of 50 nm were produced.


2.3.3. Block copolymer templating. 
In an alternative route, a series of 1D nanostructures, including core–shell nanorods, nanotubes, and plain nanorods, was synthesized with precisely controlled compositions and dimensions by using functional block copolymers with narrow molecular weight distributions and specific structures as nanoreactors. The use of cylindrical nanoreactors enable an ultrahigh degree of control over the shape, surface chemistry, size, properties, and architecture of 1D nanocrystals. Fig. 4C displays a representative SEM image of Au–Fe3O4 core–shell nanorods with a Fe3O4 shell thickness of approximately 4.6 nm, as well as the synthetic strategies for obtaining 1D core–shell nanostructures by templating with cellulose-g-(P4VP-b-PtBA-b-PS).143


2.3.4. Reverse micelle templating. 
Reverse micelle nanoreactors can be applied to design unique nanostructures with different shapes and sizes.144 Microemulsion-based synthetic methods of nanostructures are influenced by many factors, including the solvent properties and surfactant molar ratio. Experimental results have shown that increasing the water content leads to the growth of micelles, followed by the linear growth of nanostructures to a theoretically critical value over which the limited bending coefficient of the surface-active agent causes the nano/microstructure rearrangement of the microemulsion droplets, and subsequently the linear plot will exhibit a slight deviation. Additionally, microemulsion droplets with cationic surfactants lead to the growth of 1D materials, whose shape evolves into a relatively prolate spheroid. The dynamic growth of the micelle core and the intricate dynamical exchange in the anisotropic direction cause the growth of nanorods.

2.4. Other methods

2.4.1. Electrospinning. 
Electrospinning is a large-scale and cost-effective technique for manufacturing 1D nanofibers. Electrospinning uses spinning force and electric fields to eject liquid precursor materials via a fine orifice to typically form fibrous nanostructures.
At present, a range of practical fabrication techniques, such as hydrothermal synthesis, chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, electrochemical etching/deposition, electrospinning methods, template-based methods, and laser ablation, has been developed to create specific 1D nanomaterials.145 Nevertheless, 1D nanostructures are only realizable for specific materials due to the limited range of appropriate material properties for each synthetic method. Hence, a general technique is required to manufacture nanowires, as well as nanotubes, for a series of inorganic nanomaterials regardless of the crystal orientation. Electrospinning methods have been used to manufacture a variety of conductive polymer nanowires and inorganic nanowires. The feasible controlled-pyrolysis method and gradient-electrospinning method have been reported to offer low-cost, extensive material diversity, high yield, and good repeatability, providing promising methods to obtain tunable nanotubes for a series of inorganic materials, removing the restriction of the crystal growth orientation of different samples. Moreover, a variety of tubular 1D nanomaterials have been synthesized based on this synthetic method, including single metal oxide nanotubes (MnO2, Co3O4, CuO, and SnO2), binary metal oxides (LiCoO2, LiV3O8, NiCo2O4, and LiMn2O4) and multi-element oxides (LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, Na0.7Fe0.7Mn0.3O2, etc.). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the multi-hole nanotubes are shown in Fig. 5B and C. The fabrication process of pea-like nanotubes by electrostatic spinning and controlled pyrolysis is schematically illustrated in Fig. 5A. Following a process of electrostatic spinning, the compound nanowires are straight away placed into a furnace in air at 300 °C. Then, the PVA decomposes simultaneously and quickly moves to the outside high molecular weight PVA layer without taking away the desired inorganic materials, leaving inorganic materials in the central zone. The inner inorganic materials and the outer carbonized PVA develop into typical nanoparticles after high-temperature calcining under Ar atmosphere, forming pea-like nanotubes. Accordingly, the electrostatic spinning method could lead to rapid advancements in the progress of 1D nanostructures. Furthermore, these unique pea-like and mesoporous nanotubes, which show outstanding electrochemical performance in supercapacitors, and sodium-ion batteries and lithium-ion batteries, owing to their robust structural stability, high conductivity, and large surface area, hold great promise not only in electrochemical energy-storage devices but also in a number of other frontiers.

(E) Schematic of a series of steps, including the selective growth of WOx nanowires, that occur following the partial stress induced via implanted ions. First, the thin film of WOx is deposited on a silicon substrate via electron-beam evaporation. Subsequently, N2 or Ar dopants are selectively implanted onto the WOx thin film by a shadow mask. Later, compressive stress derived from the discrepancy between the thermal expansion coefficients of the substrate and the thin film during annealing at 600 °C. (F) The WOx nanowires develop only in the ion-implanted area because the ions increase the compressive stress locally. Adapted with permission from ref. 148 © 2015 Nature. 


2.4.2. Lithographically patterned method. 
Lithographic approaches include dip-pen nanolithography, electron-beam lithography, and focused-ion-beam lithography and have been exploited to fabricate designed geometry patterns on typical solid substrates. These techniques have many advantages, including the fabrication of well-aligned and large-scale nanometer arrays. Nevertheless, the low throughput and high cost of large-scale nanostructures remain challenging.
Au/MnO2 core–shell nanowires were fabricated by a lithographically patterned nanowire electrodeposition process.146 The linear Au nanowire core and hemicylindrical MnO2 shell were prepared on glass. The rectangular cross-section of the Au nanowires showed a height, width, and length of approximately 40 nm, 200 nm, and 1–10 mm, respectively. Subsequently, MnO2 was deposited on the Au nanowires by a potentiostatic electrooxidation process from a manganese ion solution, forming a hemicylindrical and conformal shell structure with a diameter of approximately 50–300 nm. The shell of the MnO2 was mesoporous and in the δ-phase, as revealed by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Moreover, TEM analysis showed that the δ-phase MnO2 shell was composed of a mesoporous net-like structure with 2 nm fibrils. This mesoporous MnO2 shell structure had a thickness of 68 ± 3 nm. Moreover, the specific capacitance of the Au/MnO2 core–shell nanowire array was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The Au/MnO2 core–shell nanostructure showed a specific capacitance of 450 F g−1 at 100 mV s−1 and 1020 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and stable cycling in aqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, the Au/MnO2 core–shell nanowires showed a capability for hybrid energy storage by the deconvolution of specific capacitance into non-insertion and insertion components. Additionally, a symmetrical capacitor consisting of horizontal, interwoven MnO2/Au nanowires has been described.147 All 750 nanowires in the capacitor had a length of 2.5 mm and consisted of an Au nanowire core (approximately 40 × 200 nm) and a δ-phase MnO2 shell (thickness of approximately 60–220 nm) (Fig. 5D). The Au/MnO2 core–shell nanowires were patterned onto the surface of a glass substrate by lithographically patterned nanowire electrodeposition.


2.4.3. Controlled stress induction. 
The controlled stress induction process is based on a peculiar stress-induced growth. Partial stress on a thin film causes the growth of nanowires. Na et al. designed and synthesized single-crystal tungsten oxide nanowires by a localized-stress-induction process with patterned growth.148 In this experiment, the growth area of the tungsten oxide thin films was implanted with ions to cause a partial increase in the compressive stress, causing the local growth of WOx nanowires at correspondingly lower temperatures of approximately 600 °C, compared to non-implanted samples (Fig. 5E and F). Moreover, the WOx nanowires were easily grown on the nanoscale patterns using a focused ion beam and on the miniature patterns using wafer-level ion implantation. The experiment also demonstrated that the WOx nanowire growth was influenced by a variety of factors, such as the atomic radius and metering of the implanted ions. In particular, the stress-induced and implanted-ion-assisted methods used for the growth of WOx nanowires are more compatible with a variety of structures due to the reduced growth temperature.

3. Properties and applications of 1D/1D-analog TMOs for advance supercapacitors
1D-based TMO nanostructures have many controllable synthesis methods, as we mentioned above. Unique advantages of their electrochemical properties make them increasingly popular in supercapacitors and other energy industries. In this section, next-generation and advanced supercapacitor devices, involving four main types (Fig. 6), are generalized and discussed in detail. Significantly, a schematic diagram of the design rules for advanced supercapacitors based on 1D TMOs is shown in Fig. 7. Apart from this, Fig. 8 shows the electrochemical performance of 1D/1D-analog nanostructures for supercapacitors, which are also discussed below (Tables 1 and 2).

3.1. Titanium oxides
Titanium dioxide has been widely applied in the fields of photovoltaic power generation, photocatalysis, lithium-ion batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors, hydrogen production, gas sensors, etc.191–193 Recently, titanium dioxide has been gaining popularity for its suitable electronic band structure and excellent surface activity.194–198 Led researched the photocatalytic water splitting of TiO2 in the 1970s.199 Moreover, with regards to quantum dot (QD), dye-sensitized, and polymer-based solar cells, TiO2-based electrodes have attracted researchers' attention due to their relatively stable performance and excellent efficiency.198,200,201 Four different polymorphs of naturally occurring TiO2 are exhibited in Fig. 9A, namely rutile, anatase, brookite, and TiO2-B. Furthermore, several metastable polymorphs of TiO2, for example, perovskite, TiO2-II, and TiO2-H, have been synthesized. Different crystalline phases have distinct properties and require different reaction conditions to form the desired morphologies and offer distinct performance. In general, rutile is the most stable crystalline phase. Moreover, the metastable states of anatase, TiO2-B, and brookite can transform into the more stable rutile phase at high temperature.

Zhang et al. synthesized MnO2/TiO2 nanowires by a large-scale and facile method. The surface morphology included anatase TiO2-B nanowires and 1D H2Ti3O7 with mesoporous birnessite-type MnO2.202 The MnO2 nanosheet/H2Ti3O7 nanowire hybrid nanostructure had a diameter of approximately 80 nm and was composed of uniform ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets with diameters of 5–10 nm. This dual structure, which imparts a loose porous composite structure with abundant electroactive surface sites and open space, is shown in Fig. 9B. Moreover, when the reaction time was prolonged to 30 h, the diameter of the MnO2 nanoflakes increased to 20 nm. The MnO2/TiO2 nanowire core–shell architecture exhibited electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 120 F g−1 (0.1 A g−1). In addition, an ASC composed of MnO2/TiO2//activated graphene yielded an improved energy density of 29.8 W h kg−1. The electrodes also showed high cycling stability with 93% retention of the initial capacitance after 3000 cycles.
Highly porous PANI nanowire/titanium dioxide nanotube arrays were prepared by electro-polymerization.169 A titanium sheet was placed in a solution of glycerol/ammonium fluoride, and then the TiO2 nanotube layer arrays were prepared by anodic treatment. The TiO2 nanotube arrays were substantially uniform with wall thicknesses of approximately 20 nm, inner diameters of approximately 40–80 nm, and outside diameters of approximately 60–100 nm, as shown in Fig. 9C. The TiO2 nanotube layer was used as a dynamic template to promote the production of the aniline monomer. Morphological and structural characterizations indicated that the PANI nanowires had diameters of 200–300 nm. The cooperation of the two substances produced a widened 1.2 V potential window over which the supercapacitor could function. The coexistence of nanotubes, nanowires, and mesopores facilitates ion diffusion and shortens the distance for charge transfer and penetration of the electrolyte. The cyclic voltammograms of a PANI/TiO2/Ti electrode in 0.05 M H2SO4 solution at scan rates of 2, 5, 8, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mV s−1 over a range of −0.3 to 0.9 V are shown in Fig. 9D. The current density of this electrode obviously increased with the increased scan rate, thus demonstrating an outstanding capacitance behavior and excellent rate properties. The CV curves show an approximately rectangular shape, with the redox peaks obviously disappeared at 50 mV s−1. The inset shows the specific capacitance of the PANI/TiO2/Ti composite electrode at various scan rates. The TiO2 nanotube array/PANI nanowire composite exhibited an optimized electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 897.35 F g−1 at 0.21 A g−1 and outstanding cycling stability over 1500 cycles with 86.2% retention of its initial capacity.
More importantly, the microtopography of the TMO nanomaterials can have a significant impact on their electrochemical performance in energy-storage applications. Anatase TiO2 nanospindles were rationally designed by a facile strategy using 3D reduced graphene oxide (RGO). This TiO2/RGO composite structure reduced the adverse effects of graphene oxide by using cellulose as an intermediate agent.149 To this end, cellulose was used as a shape-directing agent in the controlled growth of TiO2 crystals on graphene oxide. Different concentrations of cellulose solutions (0.4, 0.9, 1.7, 3.4, and 6.8 wt%) were used to fabricate TiO2 crystals with different morphologies. Fig. 9E shows the SEM image of the TiO2/RGO porous nanostructure, which shows a spindle-like shape.203 Because of its 3D hybrid structure with high aspect ratio, exposed facets, and composite TiO2 nanostructure, TiO2/RGO showed an enhanced energy density of 55.7 W h kg−1, an outstanding power density of 1327 W kg−1, and an excellent high specific capacitance of 397 F g−1.
Solid-state supercapacitors have many advantages, such as ease of handing, small size, wider range of operating temperatures, light weight, and excellent reliability.204–206 MnO2 is a promising pseudocapacitive material because of its high theoretical specific capacitance of 1400 F g−1. Nevertheless, MnO2 suffers from a comparatively low electrical conductivity of 10−5 to 10−6 S cm−1.207,208 On the other hand, TiO2 is an electrochemically stable electrode material for electrochemical devices and has a higher electrical conductivity (10−5 to 10−2 S cm−1) than MnO2.209,210
Furthermore, experiments have shown that the carrier density of pristine TiO2 can be increased by three orders of magnitude upon hydrogenation. The formation of hydrogen-treated TiO2 (H-TiO2) nanowires and MnO2 core–shell nanowire electrodes was realized by the hydrothermal method.150 The H-TiO2 nanowire core supported a carbon shell or electrochemically active MnO2. A flexible, solid-state ASC was assembled with H-TiO2/C core–shell nanowires as the negative electrode and H-TiO2/MnO2 core–shell nanowires as the positive electrode. The ASC showed an ultrahigh energy density of 0.30 mW h cm−3 (59 W h kg−1), a favorable volumetric power density of 0.23 W cm−3 (45 kW kg−1), and a specific capacitance of 139.6 F g−1 over a 1.8 V voltage window. Moreover, the device showed good flexibility and outstanding cycling performance with 8.8% capacitance loss after 5000 cycles.
3.2. Vanadium oxides
Vanadium oxides consist of VO6 octahedra and VO5 square pyramids with shared oxygen atoms. Vanadium oxides have multifarious chemical forms, including V2O3, V2O5, VO2, V3O7, V5O9, and V6O13. The different kinds of crystals with vanadium oxides include triclinic, rhombohedral, tetragonal, cubic, monoclinic, and orthorhombic. Moreover, 1D/1D-analog nanostructures of vanadium oxide can appear in various forms, such as nanobelts,211 nanowires,212–216 nanotubes,217 nanogrooves,218 nanobelt arrays,219 nanobelt forests,220 core–shell nanostructures,221–223 and porous nanowires.224 Significantly, vanadium oxide with mixed valence states has been used to improve the pseudocapacitance. Because vanadium has a variety of oxidation valence states (V2+, V3+, V4+, and V5+), it can provide a wide range of potential windows for charge storage.225 Vanadium oxide containing the positive tetravalent (V4+) and positive pentavalent (V5+) states, for example, V2O5 nanotubes and VOx nanowires, have been shown to be excellent electrode materials.226 Among the vanadium oxides, V6O13 has become a particularly promising cathode material because of its unique crystal structure. V6O13 is composed of a double layer of V(2)O6–V(3)O6 and a single layer of a composite structure of V2O5, V(1)O6, and VO2. The distorted VO6 regular octahedra accelerate the formation of low-energy defect sites. This allows for the accumulation of a large number of lithium ions through the formation of lithium vanadium oxide.
Zhai et al. synthesized sulfur-doped V6O13−x (VOS) nanowires by a two-step process. V3O7 nanowires were first grown on the surface of a cloth substrate by a hydrothermal method.151 Then, the nanowires were annealed in a nitrogen atmosphere and sulfur vapor to form the VOS nanowires. Oxygen-deficient VOS nanowires as the anode electrode in an ASC achieved a capacitance of 1353 F g−1 (0.72 F cm−2) at 1.9 A g−1. Moreover, the VOS electrode achieved a gravimetric capacitance of 1050 F g−1 (0.56 F cm−2) at 10 mV s−1. Moreover, a VOS/C electrode achieved a higher gravimetric capacitance (1121 F g−1) than the VOS electrode. The VOS/C electrode achieved excellent cycling stability with 92.3% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. Importantly, the active electrode material achieved an excellent energy density of 45.1 W h kg−1. In addition, it achieved an average power density of 478.5 W kg−1 at 1 mA cm−2.
V2O5/MnO2 core–shell tubes with tunable tunnel dimensions were synthesized by a simple aqueous-based process at room temperature.51 The particular tubular nanomorphology showed good permeability of electrolyte ions to achieve the highest utilization of the active sites. The morphology of the V2O5/MnO2 core–shell nanotubes is shown in Fig. 9F. The MnO2 epitaxial structure acts as a mechanical support to prevent the V2O5 nanostructure collapsing upon long-term cycling. Moreover, this composite nanostructure showed a specific capacitance of 694 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and retained 92% of its capacitance after 5000 cycles. Galvanic charge–discharge curves of the V2O5/MnO2 core–shell nanotubes at 1 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 9G. The V2O5/MnO2 core–shell nanotubes showed superior capacitive performance compared to pure MnO2 nanoflakes and V2O5 nanowires. Furthermore, V2O5/MnO2 hybrid nanotubes with other TMO materials yielded ternary composite materials of V2O5/MnO2/X nanotubes (X = Ni(OH)2, Co2O3/Co(OH)2, Fe2O3). This multipurpose synthetic method provides a more feasible scheme for the preparation of ternary composite nanostructures.
At present, there are still many challenges in the application of hybrid electrode materials for the manufacture of planar-type all-solid-state supercapacitors, such as the narrowing ion diffusion pathway, the intricate preparation of composite materials, and the difficulty in obtaining a high energy density comparable to that of lithium-ion batteries. Accordingly, a high-performance, flexible micro-supercapacitor composed of V2O5 nanowires, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and a solid electrolyte on-chip was prepared, which could power a SnO2 nanowire UV sensor integrated on a flexible substrate.171 The manufacturing process is shown in Fig. 9H and I. A patterned flexible micro-supercapacitor utilizing compound electrodes made of a multi-walled carbon nanotube/V2O5 nanowire composite material with 10 vol% V2O5 nanowires showed remarkable cycling performance with 82% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles at 11.6 A cm−3 and an outstanding volume capacitance of 80 F cm−3 at 10 mV s−1. Furthermore, a patterned flexible micro-supercapacitor exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, including a power density of 80.8 W cm−3, comparable to that of state-of-the-art, flexible micro-supercapacitors, and an energy density of 6.8 mW h cm−3, comparable to that of a lithium-ion thin-film battery (1–10 mW h cm−3). In particular, this flexible micro-supercapacitor array exhibited excellent mechanical stability (Fig. 9I) with a bending radius down to 1.5 mm under tensile and compressive stress. Experiments showed that even after 1000 bending cycles, 94% of the initial capacitance was retained. Most importantly, this research demonstrated an all-solid-state, flexible micro-supercapacitor with great potential as an energy-storage device for portable and wearable nanoelectronics, flexible self-powered systems, and bioinspired systems.
A negative electrode (cathode) with a high energy density is essential to obtain high energy density supercapacitors. Vanadium oxide has attracted much attention because of its layered structure, which allows efficient ion diffusion, and the presence of multiple stable oxidation states. PANI has been profusely studied as a positive electrode material because of its high capacitance of approximately 3407 F g−1 and ease of synthesis.227 Hence, PANI is a promising material to combine with TMOs to produce a negative potential window for use in ASCs. V2O5/PANI hybrid nanowires were fabricated on carbon cloth by an electro-codeposition process.58 This negative electrode had high electrochemical performance and was composed of a PANI and vanadium oxide composite film containing 1D polymer chains, as shown by X-ray diffraction and X-ray spectroscopy analyses. Moreover, this composite showed a specific capacitance of 443 F g−1 at 664.5 mF cm−2 and a potential window of 1.6 V. The flexible symmetric supercapacitor combined with the composite film exhibited an enhanced power density of 7200 W kg−1 at 33.0 W h kg−1 and an energy density of 69.2 W h kg−1 at 720 W kg−1. Most importantly, this assembled symmetric supercapacitor exhibited outstanding stability with 92% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles.
3.3. Manganese oxides
Manganese dioxide was first applied in the 1860 s for energy storage in alkaline battery cells. MnOx materials have been applied extensively in the field of materials science because of their many favorable qualities, such as their variety of synthetic methods (sol–gel, chemical, hydrothermal, electrochemical, etc.), high abundance, low toxicity, environmental friendliness, and low cost.52,228–235,322,323 Qiu et al. successfully synthesized ZnCo2O4/MnO2 nanocone arrays with a large surface area and a hierarchical and mesoporous core–shell nanostructure on 3D nickel foam by a hydrothermal process.173 The ZnCo2O4/MnO2 hierarchical cone nanostructure consisted of a MnO2 shell and a ZnCo2O4 core, as shown in Fig. 10B. The outstanding rate capability and cycling performance can be interpreted as being the result of synergistic contributions from the distinctive ZnCo2O4/MnO2 core–shell nanostructure, as shown in Fig. 10A. There are a few explanations for this synergy:

(1) The growth of the stand-alone ZnCo2O4/MnO2 cone structure on a highly conductive nickel foam substrate allows the complete elimination of the need for conductive additives and polymer binders, which drastically reduces the “dead volume” in the electrode surface.236
(2) The direct growth of ZnCo2O4/MnO2 nanocones ensures excellent electrical connection and mechanical adhesion to the current collector.237
(3) Moreover, the core material is in direct contact and is highly crystalline, which assures fast electron transport.
(4) The surface of the MnO2 shell is well separated, owing to the direct growth of ZnCo2O4 nanocones, which increases the number of active sites. MnO2 can fully contact the potassium ions in the electrolyte. Typically, the segmental active sites in MnO2-based electrode systems are impeded by numerous unwanted interfaces.238
This special structure exhibited specific capacitances of 1526 F g−1 and 2339 F g−1 at current densities of 10 A g−1 and 1 A g−1, respectively. The capacitance decreased to approximately 94.5% of the initial capacitance after 8000 cycles at 10 A g−1 and to approximately 95.9% of the initial capacitance after 3000 cycles at 2 A g−1 (Fig. 10C). Moreover, the nanostructured shell and core had cations and anions from the electrolyte that undergo separate redox reactions and contribute to electrochemical charge storage.
α-MnO2 nanowire/Ni1−xMnxOy nanoflake core–shell nanostructures were synthesized by a facile two-step solution-phase route.239 The crystal structures of α-MnO2 are shown in Fig. 10D. From Fig. 10E, the thickness of the Ni1−xMnxOy nanoflake shell is approximately 100 nm, which indicates their ultrathin features. At the same time, their supercapacitive activity was improved by their unique electrochemically active materials and large amount of exposed surface. In the first step, overlong α-MnO2 nanowires were compounded by a hydrothermal method. After that, the core–shell nanostructures were synthesized by chemical bath deposition followed by thermal annealing, which produced Ni1−xMnxOy nanoflakes grown on α-MnO2 nanowires. Moreover, these two solution-phase methods can be easily extended to large-scale production. This core–shell nanostructure offers an efficient and stable backbone for charge transport. At the same time, the α-MnO2 nanowire/Ni1−xMnxOy nanoflake nanostructures provide a large accessible surface for ions in the electrolyte. These favorable characteristics provide the electrode with remarkable and reliable stability and capacitance. This electrode achieved a capacitance of 657 F g−1 at a current density of 250 mA g−1 (Fig. 10F). Meanwhile, the core–shell nanostructures sustained over 1000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 2000 mA g−1.
Poor mechanical stability and electrical conductivity are two primary obstacles to realizing a high electrochemical performance of MnO2 as an electrode material for pseudocapacitors.241 The construction of novel hierarchical core–shell structures plays a significant role in achieving an efficient increase in the stability and rate capacity of this nanomaterial. Hierarchical α-MnO2 nanowire and ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheet core–shell nanostructures were produced using a practical and facile solution-phase technique. This particular hierarchical nanostructure was composed of only a few atomic layers attached to the surface of overlong α-MnO2 nanowires. Moreover, the core–shell nanostructure showed an initial specific capacitance of 153.8 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 and an outstanding cycling stability of 98.1% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. The excellent stability and rate capacity of the hierarchical nanostructures could be attributed to the characteristics of the two MnO2 crystals, in which the ultrathin δ-MnO2 nanosheet shell provided more reactive active sites, while the 1D α-MnO2 nanowire core created a stable structural backbone. The synergistic effects of the two dimensions similarly contributed to the excellent rate capability.
It is generally known that the conversion, adsorption, and insertion reactions associated with energy conversion, energy storage, chromatography,242 chemical sensing, and catalysis243 can be achieved using hierarchical architectures. The self-assembly of manganese dioxide mesoporous nanotubes was successfully performed from interwoven ultrathin birnessite-type manganese dioxide nanosheets using a facile hydrothermal process and by applying a polycarbonate membrane as a template.152 Moreover, the thickness and diameter of the MnO2 nanotubes could be effortlessly controlled by the choice of chemistry and membrane pore size. The porous MnO2 nanotube electrode for supercapacitors showed a cycling performance of 90.4% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles and a specific capacitance 365 F g−1 at 0.25 A g−1. A negative electrode of activated graphene and a positive electrode of porous MnO2 nanotubes were used to assemble an ASC that showed a power density of 146.2 kW kg−1 and a high energy density of 22.5 W h kg−1. This result inspired us to conclude that the supercapacitor performance was related to the hierarchical structure of the interwoven ultrathin MnO2 nanotubes.
Novel wire-shaped supercapacitors are considered to be promising advanced energy-storage technology for smart textiles; however, achieving the combination of outstanding electrochemical performance and high mechanical stretchability remains a challenge.229 Accordingly, wire-shaped supercapacitors have been applied to an asymmetric construction, showing double power density and triple energy density compared to its symmetric counterpart. A stretchable asymmetric wire-shaped supercapacitor composed of a MnO2/carbon nanotube composite fiber positive electrode, KOH–polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) electrolyte, and an aerogel carbon nanotube fiber negative electrode possessed an excellent specific capacitance of approximately 157.53 μF cm−1 at 50 mV s−1, while a cyclic tensile strain of up to 100% produced negligible effects on its performance. Most importantly, this material showed excellent stability with 99% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles.
In addition, another flexible ASC with excellent performance was synthesized by electroless plating combined with the electrodeposition of Ni-activated carbon filter paper as the negative electrode, PVA/Na2SO4 as the electrolyte, and Ni/MnO2 filter paper as the positive electrode. In this experiment, the electrode showed a high areal specific capacitance of 1900 mF cm−2 at 5 mV s−1 and an improved cycling performance of 85.1% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at 20 mA cm−2. Additionally, the flexible supercapacitors in the solid state showed suitable flexibility under a variety of bending conditions and a volume energy density of 0.78 mW h cm−3. This work suggests that ASCs could be used to drive a 3 V LED indicator. Most importantly, this study exhibited a promising method for fabricating and designing flexible supercapacitors with enhanced performance in the application of portable and wearable electronics based on different available materials.
1D flexible supercapacitors were synthesized by electrodeposition on a stainless-steel mesh. The stainless-steel fiber was covered by indium tin oxide, and then the indium tin oxide and stainless-steel mesh was covered by MnO2 shell layers by electrodeposition.240 A nanoporous, uniform, and flake-shaped MnO2 shell with an average crystallite size of approximately 2 nm and a thickness of approximately 130 nm was fabricated by electrodeposition at a constant voltage (Fig. 10H). The electrodes containing indium tin oxide nanowires exhibited an excellent rate capability because of the shortened ionic or electronic transport pathways due to the unique open pore structure. Fig. 10G shows a diagrammatic sketch of the electron transport process in the fabricated stainless-steel mesh/indium tin oxide nanowire/MnO2 nanoflake electrode. The specific capacitance increased to 667 F g−1 at scan rate of 5 mV s−1 upon using the stainless-steel mesh substrate (Fig. 10I). Furthermore, the electrode containing the stainless-steel mesh and indium tin oxide imparted stable cycling performance with nearly no reduction in specific capacitance after 5000 cycles.
3.4. Iron oxides
Iron oxide has attracted extensive attention as an anode material for ASCs due to its high theoretical capacitance, appropriate redox reactions in a negative potential window, nontoxicity, and rich abundance.244–250,267 However, Fe2O3 electrodes have low volumetric capacitance at high rates due to their poor electrical conductivity (10–14 S cm−1), leading to a low energy density and low power density. Accordingly, hierarchical Fe3O4/Fe2O3 core–shell nanorods were used as negative electrodes for ASCs. Moreover, the Fe3O4/Fe2O3 nanorod array electrodes showed a high volumetric capacitance of 1206 F cm−3 at 1.25 mg cm−2 and good cycling stability and rate capability. The Fe3O4/MnO2 core–shell composite nanostructure was used as a positive electrode for ASCs. Most importantly, the as-assembled 2 V ASCs exhibited an excellent energy density of 0.83 mW h cm−3 at 15.6 mW cm−3. Therefore, this work demonstrated the use of Fe3O4 nanorods as the conductive support for Fe2O3 materials to address concerns about their poor ion and electron transport properties. Ordered α-Fe2O3/PANI core–shell arrays were fabricated by a cost-effective and simple electrodeposition process, and showed enhanced rate performance and specific areal capacity, favorable structure stability, fast electron and ion transfer, and a large reaction surface area.35 Furthermore, this ASC was designed by adopting PANI rods grown on carbon cloth as the cathode and α-Fe2O3/PANI core–shell nanowires as the anode, which achieved a volumetric capacitance of 2.02 mF cm−3, an ultrahigh energy density of 0.35 mW h cm−3 at 120.51 mW cm−3, and 95.77% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles.
Wang et al. designed new-style electrodes with appropriate control of the carbon/metal oxide materials to obtain a good overall electrochemical performance. A thin layer of iron oxide was attached to a graphite foam/carbon nanotube framework.53 As shown in Fig. 11A, the carbon nanotube framework was uniformly covered with Fe2O3 nanoparticles (the tiny particles were approximately 10 nm in size). This composite structure displayed outstanding cycling capability with 95.4% capacitance retention after 50000 cycles and a favorable energy of 74.7 W h kg−1 at 1400 W kg−1 as the anode of a full cell. Yang et al. successfully synthesized a solid-state ASC with amorphous Fe2O3 nanotubes and α-MnO2 nanowires attached to flexible carbon fabric.251 The left photograph in Fig. 11B shows an SEM image of the highly ordered MnO2 nanowires, which were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The MnO2 nanowires were grown on carbon fiber, with lengths of 2–4 μm and diameters of 100–150 nm. The right photograph in Fig. 11B shows a SEM micrograph of the Fe2O3 nanotubes. The carbon fibers were covered by Fe2O3 nanotubes with outer diameters of approximately 100–200 nm. The design of a flexible ASC device is schematically displayed in Fig. 11C. A flexible carbon cloth was directly coated with Fe2O3 nanotubes. The conductive flexible carbon cloth not only acted as a favorable scaffold but also served as a portable current collector for active materials. The solid-state ASC device was fabricated with a Fe2O3 nanotube negative electrode and a MnO2 nanowire positive electrode. This assembled solid-state, low-cost flexible ASC device with a broad voltage window of 1.6 V showed favorable electrochemical performance, such as a good rate capability and an energy density of 0.55 mW h cm−3.

Cable-shaped energy storage devices have attracted extensive attention because of their remarkable properties, such as bendability, light weight, and small size.253 The inset in Fig. 11E shows a schematic of the cable-shaped supercapacitor device.252 Current cable-shaped supercapacitors have a symmetric configuration. Nevertheless, asymmetric cable-shaped supercapacitors, if designed, would be more attractive because of the higher energy densities and wider cell operation voltages. In fact, an advanced coil-type ASC with suitable mechanical-electrochemical stability and excellent cell operation voltage has been reported.
CuO nanowires have been consistently grown on the surface of copper wire after heat treatment. The top photograph in Fig. 11D shows CuO nanowires coated with MnO2via a conformal codeposition process, while the bottom photograph in Fig. 11D shows Fe2O3/C composite nanorods, which have lengths of approximately 300–600 nm and diameters of approximately 100–200 nm. From Fig. 11E, the specific capacitance of the cathode was 508.1 F g−1 at a scan rate 20 mV s−1. For the anode, a specific capacitance of 90.8 F g−1 was achieved at 20 mV s−1. Moreover, the cable-shaped supercapacitors achieved an extraordinary energy density of 0.85 mW h cm−3, a remarkable bending cycle stability of 93.0% after 4000 cycles at a variety of bending states, an outstanding rate capability of 95.4%, and outstanding flexibility and bendability. Furthermore, the cable-shaped supercapacitors could not only transmit electricity independently and simultaneously but were also capable of storing energy, which offers many promising applications in electronic gadgets and solar energy storage.
3.5. Cobalt oxides
Cobalt oxides have many advantages, including low toxicity, low cost, and a high specific capacitance of 3560 F g−1 in theory.254,255 In particular, during electrochemical processes, both a battery-type behavior (Co3O4 + OH− + H2O ↔ 3MOOH + e−) and pseudocapacitive behavior (CoOOH + OH− ↔ CoO2 + H2O + e−) contribute to the capacitance. Moreover, ion fast diffusion and electron effective transportation would result in an improved performance of supercapacitors.256–259 Wang et al. synthesized hybrid nanowire arrays by a hydrothermal method, followed by a controlled carbon deposition process and annealing via chemical vapor deposition at a relatively low temperature.260 CoO nanowire arrays were grown on 3D nickel foam and coated with highly conductive carbon. Crystalline carbon and partially amorphous carbon were observed in the carbon shell via TEM. Upon carbon deposition, the capacitive behaviors and electrical conductivity were dramatically promoted. The growth mechanism of the nanostructures was determined via XPS and TEM analyses, which showed that the decomposition of C2H2 was catalyzed by CoO at low temperature (approximately 427 °C) in a catalytic and reduction process. CoO/C nanostructure arrays with low resistance and hydrophilic surfaces were tested and showed a specific capacitance of 3282.2 F g−1, similar to the theoretical value. The composite electrode material showed a good rate capability and cycling stability (96.9% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles). They assembled a positive electrode of the CoO/C nanostructure arrays and a negative electrode of activated carbon into an aqueous ASC, which showed an energy density of 58.9 W h kg−1.
Huang et al. fabricated a battery made of flexible composite electrodes by a deft electrodeposition method.255 Nickel and cobalt double hydroxide nanosheets attached to porous NiCo2O4 nanowires were grown on carbon fiber paper. In this study, the Co0.67Ni0.33 DHs/NiCo2O4/CFP composite nanostructures provided remarkable cycling stability in different stoichiometries of CoxNi1−x double hydroxide nanosheets with a capacitance of 1.64 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2. An outstanding rate capability was exhibited in this hybrid electrode, which showed satisfactory areal capacitance with only 33% loss after the current density was increased from 2 mA cm−2 to 90 mA cm−2. Moreover, this hybrid composite electrode offered a power density of approximately 41.25 kW kg−1 and a specific energy density of approximately 33 W h kg−1 at high cycling rates (up to 150 mA cm−2).
These particular NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays were applied on carbon textiles with a polypyrrole shell layer to increase the pseudocapacitive performance.155 The manufacturing process of 3D mesoporous NiCo2O4/polypyrrole coaxial nanowires attached to carbon textiles is schematically illustrated in Fig. 12A. In the first step, mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanowires were grown on carbon textiles by a hydrothermal and post-annealing process. Subsequently, the NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays were coated with polypyrrole nanospheres via a chemical polymerization route. The charge–storage processes in the mesoporous NiCo2O4/polypyrrole nanowires leading to the improved electrochemical utilization are shown in Fig. 12B. The short ion transport channels in the NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays and the highly conductive polypyrrole, together with synergistic effects between the polypyrrole and NiCo2O4, imparted remarkable cycling stability and an excellent specific capacitance of 2244 F g−1 and rate capability to the NiCo2O4/polypyrrole hybrid electrode. From Fig. 12C, the cycling stability of the NiCo2O4/polypyrrole nanowires was enhanced by the coaxial mesoporous structure, in which the mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanowire core offered a firm skeleton to connect the polypyrrole spheres; while at the same time, the polypyrrole nanosphere layer protects the NiCo2O4 core from dissolving in the electrolyte. Moreover, a flexible and lightweight ASC was successfully assembled by adopting activated carbon and binary NiCo2O4/polypyrrole nanowires as electrodes, and showed a cycling stability of 89.2% retention after 5000 cycles, an outstanding energy density of 58.8 W h kg−1 at 365 W kg−1, a high power density of 10.2 kW kg−1 at 28.4 W h kg−1, and improved flexibility. Furthermore, this 3D coaxial nanostructure design opens new paths to manufacturing high electrochemical performance, flexible supercapacitors for future wearable and portable electronic devices.

Co3O4/NiCoAl-layered double hydroxide nanowire arrays were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal synthesis route.261 The layered double hydroxide nanosheets had an enormous electroactive surface area and were uniformly dispersed on the Co3O4 nanowires, which enabled fast electron transport and enhanced the electrochemical performance of the NiCoAl-layered double hydroxide. The layered double hydroxide nanosheets attached to the surface of the Co3O4 nanowire are shown in Fig. 12D. The inset shows the specific nanostructure of the Co3O4/NiCoAl-layered double hydroxide nanowires. The adjacent lattice distance of 0.48 nm corresponds to the (111) lattice plane spacing of the Co3O4 phase. Additionally, the adjacent lattice distance is 0.26 nm, corresponding to the (012) interplanar spacing of the layered double hydroxide phase. The specific capacitances of the Co3O4/NiCoAl-layered double hydroxide nanowire arrays at various current densities are shown in Fig. 12E, which also displays their high coulombic efficiency and typical electrochemical capacitive behavior. The specific capacitance of the Co3O4/NiCoAl-layered double hydroxide arrays at 15, 10, 5, 2, 1, and 20 A g−1 were 663, 721, 779, 855, 982, and 1104 F g−1, respectively.
A high-performance supercapacitor was designed by using novel 3D thin and porous graphite foam as a conductive and light substrate for the growth of TMO core–shell nanowire arrays to form integrated electrodes in order to combine the advantages of modified conductivity, a porous nanostructure, and a lightweight substrate.54 A photograph of the positive electrode is shown in Fig. 12F. The mesoporous nanostructure of a Co3O4 and PEDOT-MnO2 core–shell nanowire grown on graphite foam is shown in Fig. 12G. The nanowire shell was a conducting polymer/MnO2 composite, while the core was Co3O4. The Co3O4/PEDOT-MnO2 core–shell nanowires exhibited the advantages of this novel integrated electrode design over three different less-integrated electrodes.
3.6. Nickel oxides
The molecular formulas of nickel oxides include Ni2O3, NiO, and NiO2. The crystalline phases of nickel oxides consist of hexagonal crystals, cubic, and monoclinic.262 NiO is a hopeful pseudocapacitor material because of its distinct redox, low cost, and high theoretical capacitance (about 2573 F g−1).182,263–266 Strikingly, spinel-type nickel–cobalt oxide has attracted a lot of attention recently. It offers abundant electrochemical reactions. Furthermore, it has a higher electrical conductivity (around 10−1 to 10 S cm−1) than single materials like NiO, Co3O4 (10−3 to 10−2 S cm−1) and MnO2 (10−6 to 10−5 S cm−1). Porous nickel–cobalt oxide nanowires were fabricated for supercapacitor applications by a dodecyl anion-assisted recrystallization process from single-crystal nickel–cobalt binary carbonate hydroxide nanowires.157 This porous NixCo3−xO4 nanowire array was synthesized by the heat treatment of Ni–Co binary carbonate hydroxide nanowires grown on nickel foam. Nanocrystals with diameters below 10 nm were used to assemble the porous NixCo3−xO4 nanowires, which are shown in the inset of Fig. 12H. The diameter of the NixCo3−xO4 nanowires was approximately 80 nm. The binder-free NixCo3xO4 nanowire electrode exhibited a stable rate capability and an enhanced specific capacitance of 792 F g−1 at 30 A g−1 and 1479 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which are shown in Fig. 12H. Moreover, activated carbon and the NixCo3xO4–nickel foam composite were assembled into an ASC, which achieved excellent stability over long-term charge/discharge cycles and an outstanding specific capacitance of 105 F g−1 at 3.6 mA cm−2 (58.7 F g−1 at 89.4 mA cm−2).
Liu et al. synthesized an independent binder-free 3D Ni/NiO nanowire membrane by an ordinary filtration method.268 The “shell” NiO layer and “core” Ni nanowire network worked as the active material and current collector, respectively. The nanowires could maintain their echinate and rough surface at an appropriate annealing temperature. Moreover, the welded nickel nanowire cores comprising the conductive network were well preserved without isolation (0.53 Ω sq−1). The particular 3D multigrade mesoporous nanostructure not only showed a large amount of electroactive sites for the Faraday reaction but also accelerated the deintercalation and intercalation of electrolyte ions. Furthermore, the supercapacitor electrode showed an excellent rate capability, and 96.1% (36.9 F cm−3) of its initial capacitance was retained at a high discharge current density. Conclusively, the membrane electrode showed an excellent stable cycling life, with retention of the capacitance at a high rate and volumetric capacitance, making it a promising candidate for application in portable electronic products.
α-Fe2O3/NiO nanostructures anchored on carbon cloth were fabricated by a hydrothermal approach.182 NiO nanosheets were grown on α-Fe2O3 nanorod scaffolds without using any ancillary materials and were then directly applied onto a supercapacitor. The flexible supercapacitor exhibited a cyclic performance of 96.2% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 1 mA cm−2 and an enhanced areal capacitance of 557 mF cm−2. The appropriate combination of different electrochemically active materials produced the enhanced electrochemical performance.
PANI is an outstanding pseudocapacitor material and a promising conducting polymer for application in high-powered supercapacitors.181 Nevertheless, its ordinary cycling properties, due to its structural instability, remain a primary obstacle to its practical application. Accordingly, the structural design of PANI-based supercapacitors is a promising solution. Therefore, novel NiCo2O4/PANI core–shell nanorod arrays were successfully synthesized for supercapacitors. Moreover, the ultrathin PANI layer, as the active component, and the porous NiCo2O4 nanostructure, as the strain buffer support and conductive core, provided an enhanced rate capability and cycling stability. Additionally, this heterostructure, by adopting an optimal close and uniform coating of PANI, achieved a stable cycling performance of 91% capacitance retention over 3000 cycles at 10 A g−1 and a specific capacitance of 901 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The improved electrochemical performance indicated the synergistic effect of the nanostructure components in the designed composite electrode.
3.7. Copper oxides
Copper is a promising candidate for commercial applications, as it is one of the most abundant metallic elements on the earth. It is vital to develop technologies to fabricate 1D/1D-analog copper oxide nanomaterials with high stability and monodispersity for future low-cost electrochemical energy storage devices.269,270 Owing to copper oxides being environment friendly and low cost, Cu2O and CuO have been widely researched in clean energy research fields, such as for use in supercapacitors,36,270,271 solar cells,272 photocatalysis, Li-ion batteries,273–276 sensors,277 electrochemical charge storage, and water splitting.278 Currently, hierarchical core–shell nanostructures are a hot research topic in the nanoelectrochemical field because of their potential for highly efficient electrodes for supercapacitors.158 A cost-effective and simple approach has been developed to compound CuO/MnO2 core–shell structures without the use for any surfactants as electrodes for ASCs. This supercapacitor, with activated graphite oxide as the negative electrode and the CuO/MnO2 hybrid nanostructure as the positive electrode, showed a power density of 85.6 kW kg−1 and a high energy density of 22.1 W h kg−1. Moreover, this ASC showed excellent stability with 101.5% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. This simple strategy to manufacture CuO/MnO2 core–shell hierarchical nanostructures with observably improved electrochemical performance opens a feasible avenue for the design of high-performance supercapacitors.
Lightweight and flexible wire-shaped supercapacitors have many advantages; for example, their potential in wearable and portable electronics and their versatile device design.279 Nevertheless, the rational modification of typical 1D substrates with complicated nanostructures is a challenge at present. Xue et al. successfully designed a 1D nanostructured electrode consisting of a CoFe-layered double hydroxide platelet shell and a CuO-nanowire core on a typical copper wire, as shown in Fig. 13C. The asymmetric wire-shaped supercapacitor was based on an activated carbon electrode, KOH–PVA electrolyte, and CuO/CoFe-layered double hydroxide nanowires, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 13A and B. This advanced all-solid-state ASC showed outstanding cycling stability with 99.5% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles and an energy density of 1.857 mW h cm−3. Additionally, the specific capacitance of the ASC is shown in Fig. 13D.

Nickel copper oxide nanowire arrays were successfully designed by a flexible and industrially compatible process.183 In particular, a series of studies on the effect of temperature on Ni–Cu binary compounds was presented. High-magnification TEM images of the 1D nickel copper binary oxide produced at a reaction temperature of 120 °C are shown in the inset of Fig. 13E. This binary oxide nanowire showed an excellent rate capability of 1542 F g−1 at 50 mV s−1, a cycling performance of 90% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at 10 A g−1, and a specific capacitance of 1955 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1 (Fig. 13E).
The search for more efficient, safer, and faster energy storage systems has inspired researchers to exploit novel energy-storage materials with enhanced performances.159 As such, mesoporous nanostructures are compelling for high-performance supercapacitors due to their controlled porosity, large number of active sites, and high surface area, which allows the utilization of the capacitance of the active materials. The hierarchical mesopores of HO–CuCo2O4 nanowire arrays are evident by TEM (inset of Fig. 13F). Ordered mesoporous CuCo2O4 nanowires were synthesized using a silica SBA-15 template and showed a capacitance of 1210 F g−1, which rose to 3080 F g−1 after 250 subsequent cycles due to electroactivation of the electrode (Fig. 13F). Moreover, an activated carbon negative electrode and mesoporous CuCo2O4 nanowire positive electrode were utilized to form an ASC, which showed an outstanding energy density of 42.8 W h kg−1 at 15 kW kg−1. The experiment also demonstrated that two ASCs in series could readily power 5 mm diameter green, red, and blue LED indicators for 60 min. This research provided a novel method for the generation of hybrid ASCs to bridge the energy gap between double-layer supercapacitors and chemical batteries.
An advanced sacrificial substrate was proposed to convert part of the current collector into high-performance active materials for superconductors, which offers a feasible route for achieving improved energy density in supercapacitors.280 Remarkably, a copper foam current collector was successfully converted into a porous copper and nickel hybrid oxide electrode for high-performance and lightweight supercapacitors. Moreover, this method circumvents the challenges associated with the relatively poor contact interface between the current collector and electrode. Additionally, the weight of the supercapacitor could be further minimized. This current collector achieved an enhanced areal capacitance of 3.13 F cm−2 at 1 A g−1. In addition, the capacitance could retain 2.97 F cm−2 at 4 A g−1 and 93.5% retention at 4 A g−1 after 1600 cycles. Most importantly, the liquid ASC exhibited an enhanced energy density of 53 W h kg−1 at 1.4 kW kg−1.
3.8. Zinc oxides
Zinc oxides with molecular formulas of ZnO2, and ZnO can be fabricated to have two crystalline phases: cubic and hexagonal crystals. ZnO shares three primary crystalline structures of rock-salt wurtzite and zinc-blende. Furthermore, zinc oxides are used for various applications, such as supercapacitors, air batteries, lithium-ion batteries,281–286 lithium–sulfur batteries, gas sensing, photocatalysis,287 biosensors, and field-emission288,289 and light-emitting diodes.290 These 1D/1D-analog zinc oxide nanostructures can be grown in the morphology of nanowires,291 nanorods, nanobelts,292 nanocables,293,294 nanohelices,295etc. Consequently, unique flexible supercapacitors were prepared by a flexible solution-based process using a conformal ultrathin Ni(OH)2 layer of just 2 nm deposited on a vertical ZnO nanowire array and a highly conductive textile substrate.164 This ultrathin Ni(OH)2 layer enabled a reversible and fast redox reaction, and had abundant active sites for the reversible redox reaction, in turn, enhancing the capacitance. Additionally, ZnO nanowires grown on wearable textile fibers provide shortened ion diffusion paths and effective electrolyte transport. ZnO/Ni(OH)2 hybrid nanowire electrodes yielded a specific capacitance of 3150 F g−1 in lithium hydroxide aqueous solution. Moreover, an asymmetric electrochemical capacitor with a carbon-nanotube-embedded flexible textile as the negative electrode and ZnO/Ni(OH)2 hybrid nanowires as the positive electrode showed an excellent energy density of 54 W h kg−1, a 96% initial capacitance retention after 5000 cycles, and a power density of 110 kW kg−1.
A hierarchical ZnCo2O4/Ni foam structure was produced by a facile, scalable, solution-based approach186 and achieved a good cycling stability of 97% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 6 A g−1, a rate capability of 72.5% capacity retention at 20 A g−1, and a specific capacitance of 1400 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Two ZnCo2O4-based electrodes were used to assemble an all-solid-state supercapacitor that showed enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of long-term cycling stability and high specific capacitance. The results demonstrate that this high-performance supercapacitor could be used not only in high-performance energy density applications but also in high power density applications, such as flexible electronics, energy-storage devices, and electric vehicles.
Notwithstanding, MnO2 is a promising nanomaterial for high-power supercapacitors because of its considerable natural abundance and electrochemical performance; however, its application is restricted by its ordinary electrical conductivity,293 experiments have demonstrated that the electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity of ZnO nanowire materials can be improved by hydrogenation. Hydrogenated ZnO/ZnO-doped MnO2 core–shell cable-like nanostructures were synthesized on carbon cloth with a core of single-crystal zinc oxide and a shell of amorphous zinc oxide-doped manganese dioxide nanocables. As a supercapacitor electrode, the nanostructures exhibited an excellent specific capacitance of 1260.9 F g−1 and an areal capacitance of 138.7 mF cm−2. Meanwhile, this flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor composed of the novel composite electrodes and lithium chloride-PVA electrolyte exhibited 87.5% retention of the original capacitance after 10000 cycles and a high total areal capacitance of 26 mF cm−2. Moreover, dye-sensitized solar cells and series-wound supercapacitors were assembled for use in independent self-powered systems.
Zheng et al. successfully synthesized ZnO/NiO core–shell nanostructures with Au nanoparticles as a supercapacitor electrode material296 (Fig. 14B). The energy level chart of the charge processes in the NiO–Au and ZnO–Au electrode indicated that the gold nanoparticles produced a typical electron-trapping channel, as shown in Fig. 14A. This hybrid electrode exhibited outstanding performance with long-term cycling stability and a maximum areal capacitance of 4.1 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2, which is higher than that of ZnO/NiO hierarchical materials (0.5 F cm−2). The improved electrochemical performance was demonstrated to be due to the short electron diffusion pathway, the good electrical conductivity, and the increased electro–electrolyte interface. Additionally, electrons can be temporarily accumulated and trapped at the Fermi level, due to the Schottky barrier, during charging at the Ag/NiO interface until the space between NiO and ZnO is filled. Therefore, extra electrons can be released during discharging. This also inspired us to suppose that appropriate interface engineering may improve the performance of supercapacitors.

Zhang et al. successfully synthesized mesoporous zinc–nickel–cobalt composite oxide nanowires on Ni foam by a hydrothermal process with subsequent calcination.161 This hierarchical mesoporous composite nanowire array (Fig. 14C and D) was directly utilized in a typical supercapacitor. The Ni foam-supported Zn–Ni–Co ternary oxide array showed an outstanding rate capability of approximately 91.9% capacitance retention at 5 A g−1, an excellent capacitance of 2481.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a cycling performance of 94% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles, and an energy density of 35.6 W h kg−1. This supercapacitor was assembled using activated carbon as the negative electrode and the Zn–Ni–Co ternary oxide array as the positive electrode.
The practical application of TMO electrode materials is restricted by their low electron transfer rate.163 Hence, Co2Ni3ZnO8 nanowire array electrode materials (Fig. 14F) were synthesized that could be considered to be composed of zinc and nickel ions doped into Co3O4. The material showed an improved electrochemical response and high electron transfer rate. Most importantly, doping increased the reaction of the nickel/cobalt ions with the electrolyte, as well as the number of crystal defects. The crystal structure of Co3O4 is shown in Fig. 14E. In general, the Co2Ni3ZnO8 nanowire electrode showed a specific capacitance of 1115 F g−1 at 4 A g−1. An ASC was designed using activated carbon and Co2Ni3ZnO8 nanowires and showed a power density of 3200 W kg−1 at an energy density of 54.04 W h kg−1.
Wang et al. synthesized rhombus-like ZnO/Co3O4 core–shell 3D nanostructures, shown in Fig. 14H, using a hydrothermal process combined with a simple annealing treatment.185 Mesoporous Co3O4 nanowires were grown on dendroid ZnO nanorods. This supercapacitor, based on Co3O4 and ZnO/Co3O4 heterostructures, showed an improved capacitance of 857.7 F g−1. Most importantly, the unique ZnO/Co3O4 electrode increased in capacitance from 1.29 to 1.66 F cm−2 (830.8 F g−1) over 6000 cycles at 6 A g−1. The outstanding performance of the ZnO/Co3O4 3D heterostructures had many advantages, in part because of the high chemical stability of the rhombus-like ZnO nanostructures. These 3D ZnO nanorods provide abundant sites for Co3O4 nanowire growth and act as stable scaffolds (Fig. 14G).
3.9. Molybdenum oxides
Molybdenum oxides are composed of MoO4 tetrahedra or MoO6 octahedra with shared oxygen atoms. They can be composed of non-stoichiometric MoOx (2 < x < 3) or stoichiometric MoO2 and MoO3.298 Molybdenum oxides have multifarious crystalline phases, such as hexagonal, monoclinic, cubic, triclinic, and orthorhombic crystals. In quest of a 1D nanostructure, they are prepared by different synthesis methods to form nanowire bundles,299 nanobelts,300–303 nanowires,304–306 nanowire arrays,307,308etc.
Significantly, combinatorial approaches for compound nanostructures containing conductive polymers and TMOs have gained enormous attention because of their excellent pseudocapacitive properties, which are principally connected with near-surface or surface reversible redox reactions, as well as the solid-state diffusion of electrolyte ions.309 Based on the interplay of diffusion-controlled and surface-controlled redox reactions, Kumar et al. designed a nanostructure containing hollow hexagonal molybdenum trioxide nanorods and PANI, which enhanced the electrochemical performance of the composite electrode. The Fe3+ ions served as an oxidant, which was polymerized with aniline monomers, to assist the synthesis of hexagonal MoO3 hollow nanorods. These results demonstrated that the Kirkendall effect, through a cation exchange-assisted process, drove the growth of hexagonal MoO3 hollow nanorods via the ferric ions. The polymerized hexagonal MoO3 exhibited excellent performance, including enhanced cycling stability and pseudocapacitive performance (270 F g−1) at a current density of 1 A g−1, which is higher than that of pristine PANI (180 F g−1) and hexagonal MoO3 hollow nanorods at 1 A g−1.
Branched CoMoO4/CoNiO2 nanowire arrays were successfully synthesized on nickel foam via a two-step hydrothermal method.166 This hybrid electrode architecture achieved outstanding electrochemical performance because of the characteristic needle-like CoNiO2 nanostructure and the ultrahigh activity of the branched CoMoO4 nanowires, which showed an optimized cycling stability with 95.7% capacitance retention over 5000 cycles at 30 mA cm−2 and an excellent areal specific capacitance of 5.31 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2. Negative electrodes made of activated carbon and positive electrodes made of the CoMoO4/CoNiO2 nanowire arrays constituted an all-solid-state ASC that showed an enhanced rate capability of 59.75 W h kg−1 at 1464 W kg−1, an excellent areal specific capacitance of 1.54 F cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2, and an ultrahigh cycling performance with no capacitance decline after 50000 cycles at 100 mA cm−2. Apart from this, after rapid charging for one second, this ASC in series could light an LED for a very long time and readily drive a mini-motor, thus showing promising commercial potential in scalable integrated applications and energy storage.
An advanced in situ nitrogen and low-valence-state molybdenum codoping strategy was developed to observably improve the electrochemical stability,310 active-site accessibility, and conductivity of MoO3, markedly boosting the electrochemical properties. As such, N/MoO3−x nanowires showed exceptional electrochemical performance as an anode material for both microbial fuel cells and fiber-shaped ASCs. The fuel cells and fiber-shaped ASCs based on the N/MoO3−x nanowire anode could provide an extraordinary power density of 0.76 mW cm−1 and a remarkable energy density of 2.29 mW h cm−3, respectively. This bifunctional N/MoO3−x nanowire anode provides a way to integrate electrical storage and generation for self-powered sources. From Fig. 15A, a 1D-based NiMoO4 branched metal oxide array was synthesized on carbon cloth to improve the ASC performance by optimizing the electrical cohesion and structural integrity of the molybdenum-based electrode.167 Additionally, a NiMoO4/PANI hybrid electrode showed an improved specific capacitance of 1340 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2, compared with that of pristine NiMoO4 nanowires of 1142 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2 (Fig. 15B), an outstanding capacitance retention of 96.7% after 2000 cycles, and a coulombic efficiency of 99.5%. Most importantly, an activated carbon negative electrode and a NiMoO4/PANI hybrid nanowire positive electrode were combined to form an all-solid-state ASC that achieved a specific power of 10667 W kg−1, a specific energy of 99.26 W h kg−1, and an outstanding stable cyclic performance with robust flexibility.

3.10. Other TMOs
Tungsten oxides consist of a WO6 octahedra via shared oxygen at the corners. They can be composed of non-stoichiometric WOx (2 < x < 3) or stoichiometric WO2 and WO3. Tungsten oxides have a variety of crystalline phases, including orthorhombic, monoclinic, tetragonal, and triclinic crystals, with different transition temperatures for the 1D/1D-analog morphologies of the tungsten oxides,34,311,312 such as nanorods, nanotubes, nanowires, nanobelts, etc. Consequently, Shen et al. successfully prepared WO3 nanowires attached to a conductive carbon cloth substrate by a hydrothermal process,190 as shown in Fig. 15C. This solid-state supercapacitor was stabile with almost 100% capacity retention after 2000 cycles and a specific capacitance of 521 F g−1 at 3 A g−1 (Fig. 15D). Furthermore, Zhao et al. designed a new type of smart supercapacitor based on a PANI substrate with a pattern of W18O49 nanowires.313 This supercapacitor not only had high electrochemical performance but also had outstanding electrochromic behavior and could operate in potential windows of 0–0.8 V (PANI) and −0.5–0 V (W18O49). In particular, the variation in color depended on the variation in energy storage over the 1.3 V window.
Niobium oxides consist of NbO6 octahedrons and NbO4 tetrahedrons with shared oxygen atoms. Furthermore, they can be composed not only of stoichiometric NbO, Nb2O5, and NbO2, but also non-stoichiometric Nb22O54 and Nb12O29. Niobium oxides have various crystalline phases, including tetragonal, hexagonal, monoclinic, orthorhombic, and cubic crystals. Additionally, their advantageous properties make them valuable for different technological and scientific applications, including field emission, electrochromic effects, photovoltaic, and catalysis. Orthorhombic-phase niobium oxide (T-Nb2O5) nanowires with an ultrathin carbon coating were synthesized by a hydrothermal method and presented stable high-rate Li-ion storage ability.168 A hybrid supercapacitor was fabricated by activated carbon as the cathode and carbon-coated T-Nb2O5 as the anode. This hybrid supercapacitor device exhibited a power density of 7.5 kW kg−1 and an energy density of 43.4 W h kg−1 with outstanding stability.
Due to its low resistivity, thermal stability, and high chemical and high specific capacitance (700 F g−1), RuO2 has become one of the most popular electrode material.314 In particular, the redox processes of ruthenium dioxide are reversible. From Fig. 15E, Wu et al. synthesized ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) nanotubes with an interwoven hydrous nanostructure directly onto a titanium substrate without any binder by a facile templating method at a low temperature of 90 °C.189 In this synthetic method, the cobalt-hydroxide-carbonate nanowire array template could be thoroughly dissolved after growth of the tubular nanostructure. This synthetic method was facile and cost effective, and the obtained material possessed suitable water content and crystallinity. Furthermore, this distinct structure exhibited an outstanding specific capacitance of 745 F g−1 at 32 A g−1, compared to the capacitance value of 840 F g−1, and the material retained 88.7% of its capacitance at 2 A g−1 (Fig. 15F).
Zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) is a white crystalline oxide of zirconium. Its most naturally existence form, with a monoclinic crystalline structure, is the typical mineral baddeleyite. Additionally, ZrO2 is chemically unreactive. It is slowly attacked by concentrated sulfuric acid and hydrofluoric acid. Due to its unique physical and chemical properties, zirconium dioxide has been widely investigated in various fields, including supercapacitors, oxygen sensors, ceramics, fuel cell membranes, and electrochromic devices. A graphene/zirconium oxide composite was synthesized by an in situ hydrothermal method from zirconium oxynitrate and graphene oxide precursors.187 The nanostructure of the graphene/zirconium oxide nanocomposite was vertically aligned to PANI, which led to a high electrical conductivity (70.8 S cm−1), excellent specific capacitance (1359.99 Fg−1 at 1 mV s−1), and large surface area (207.1 m2 g−1) as a supercapacitor electrode material. This nanostructure, vertically aligned to a conducting polymer, provided numerous redox active sites and enabled effortless contact with electrolyte ions during charging and discharging. Conclusively, this low-cost and simple method can be used for the large-scale production of various other functional structures for energy storage.
4. Conclusion and outlook
Currently, 1D nanomaterials are widely studied for use in electrochemical energy-storage devices because of their relatively short path lengths for ion and electron transport and insertion/extraction, large specific surface areas, and facile strain relaxation during electrochemical cycling. Furthermore, 1D-based TMO nanostructures have attracted much attention from both the research community and the commercial sector worldwide. Meanwhile, we have advanced reasonable improvements in the electrochemical performance of 1D/1D-analog TMO electrode materials and anticipate that this review can facilitate further studies and advancements in this field:
(1) The results of both theoretical calculations and experimental research have indicated that structural control and interfacial modification can observably enhance the rate performance, cycling ability, and specific capacity of 1D TMOs. It is key to design the 1D-analog nanostructure (e.g., core–shell nanostructure, array architecture, branched structure, layered structure, porous nanostructures) based on 1D structures, which can facilitate more direct electron transport pathways and higher surface areas. Accordingly, 1D heteronanostructures play a significant role in the research of energy nanomaterials.
(2) The capacity can be enhanced by controlling the surface area, pore properties, and morphology. Nanostructures based on 1D/1D-analog TMOs with higher specific surface areas can provide more electroactive sites and enable efficient contact with the electrolyte, leading to a higher charge and discharge capacity at a large current density.
(3) Nanoscale composite materials may have higher electrochemical conductivity and specific capacitance. Composite nanostructures not only compensate for the disadvantages of the separate components but also incorporate the advantages of all the constituents. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of 1D/1D-analog TMOs and conducting polymers or carbon nanomaterials can maximize the properties of different components, for example, to further improve the conductivity of the TMO materials.
(4) An asymmetric capacitor can be designed to simultaneously achieve high power and energy density. TMOs have inherent limitations in their electrochemical properties, such as their small operating potential windows. Consequently, asymmetric capacitors assembled with the combination of carbon materials as the negative electrode and TMOs as the positive electrode can enable obtaining higher potential windows, as well as enhanced energy storage capabilities. Moreover, designing reasonable electrolytes to optimize the performance of asymmetric capacitors may lead to higher voltage operation windows without loss of the outstanding cycling stability.

(E) Schematic of a series of steps, including the selective growth of WOx nanowires, that occur following the partial stress induced via implanted ions. First, the thin film of WOx is deposited on a silicon substrate via electron-beam evaporation. Subsequently, N2 or Ar dopants are selectively implanted onto the WOx thin film by a shadow mask. Later, compressive stress derived from the discrepancy between the thermal expansion coefficients of the substrate and the thin film during annealing at 600 °C. (F) The WOx nanowires develop only in the ion-implanted area because the ions increase the compressive stress locally. Adapted with permission from ref. 148 © 2015 Nature.
