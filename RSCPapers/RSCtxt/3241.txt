    , Accepted 18th December 2015First published on 21st December 2015AbstractIn this study, the nanocomposites of cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles and hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) were fabricated through in situ growing of CdS nanoparticles on BNNSs. The microstructure of the nanocomposites was clearly demonstrated. Compared with pure CdS nanoparticles, CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites show more efficient photocatalytic H2 production. The rate of H2 evolution can be doubled under the optimum conditions. The enhancement of photocatalytic H2 evolution is attributed to the ultrathin BNNSs. It is speculated that the BNNSs not only broaden the photo-absorption region, but also realized effective electronic communication through the connection between CdS nanoparticles and BNNSs. This new finding provides a promising way to design and fabricate more efficient photocatalysts based on BNNSs.
1. Introduction
Due to the two-dimensional layer structure analogous to graphene,1–3 hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) have received a great deal of attention for potential applications from both the experimental and theoretical science communities because graphene has attracted enormous interest.4–7 To date, many elaborated studies have been devoted to the properties and potential applications of BNNSs, such as electrical resistance,8,9 thermal conductivity,10,11 catalytic activity,12,13 and opto-electronic properties.14,15 In addition, BNNSs supports can be appealing candidates because they provide a platform for attaching particles and endowing the “defective” particle surface with highly active sites.16 Therefore, the impact of BNNSs in association with other nanomaterials to produce nanocomposites with promising potential applications, such as sensors, energy storage, and catalysis, has captured the interest of some researchers.17–20 For example, BNNSs supported on Au was theoretically suggested and experimentally proved to act as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction.21
However, for photocatalytic activity, common BNNSs are considered to have no effect, because h-BN is an insulator with a wide band gap (3.6–7.1 eV depending on experimental methods).22,23 However, to our surprise and excitement, BNNSs show unique properties compared with bulk h-BN. First, the band gap of the BNNSs can be significantly reduced by B- and N-vacancies and impurity defects.16,24 Second, the atomically thin h-BN nanoribbons are shown to possess semiconducting properties due to conducting edge states and vacancy defects.16 Third, electron tunneling through ultrathin h-BN layers deposited on a gold surface was demonstrated.25 Therefore, it seems that ultrathin BNNSs may play a crucial role in respect of improving the performance of photocatalytic materials.
CdS is one of the most vital and classical chalcogenide semiconductors, and its narrow but direct bandgap (2.4 eV) is effective for capturing visible light and water splitting.26–28 However, the rapid radiative recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in solar-activated CdS and the high kinetic barrier for hydrogen production over its surface sites do not allow the direct conversion of solar energy to hydrogen gas.29–31 Moreover, CdS shows a relatively limited spectral response range, only light with enough photon energy (shorter than 510 nm) is able to be absorbed.32,33
Herein, nanocomposites of CdS nanoparticles and BNNSs with broad spectral responses were designed and fabricated for efficient hydrogen production from water. For the first time, CdS nanoparticles were shown to grow in situ on BNNSs. Moreover, because of the feature of broad spectral response, the new nanocomposites showed efficient photocatalytic performances. According to this result, BNNSs augur well for broader prospective applications in the electron conduction and photocatalysis fields.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of BNNSs
In a typical experiment, a 10 mol L−1 sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was prepared as a dispersing agent. Then, 30 mL dispersing agent was placed into a clean flask containing 0.2 g h-BN powder. Subsequently, the flask was capped and bath-sonicated for 24 h. The flask was taken out and a slight odor of ammonia was noticed when the vial was opened. The product was collected and washed with deionized water repeatedly until the pH of the filtrate was close to neutral. The product was placed in a 500 mL beaker with almost a full glass of ethanol, after the beaker was shaken for several times, the dispersion was allowed to settle for two weeks to sediment out these undispersed particles as much as possible. Then, the supernatant was collected and about 20 mg BNNSs from 0.2 g bulk BN were obtained for further use.
2.2 Synthesis of CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites
Several specific weight BNNSs were dissolved in 30 mL ethanediol. Then, 0.343 g Cd(SCN)2 and 0.285 mL [BMIM]SCN were also added to the ethanediol. The ethanediol solvents were added to poly-(tetrafluoroethylene)-lined autoclaves of a microwave digestion system after all the reagents were dissolved. The autoclaves were maintained at 180 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the precipitation was filtered and washed with ethanol and water several times. At last, almost the same weight of 0.1960 g CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites with specific weights of BNNSs (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 wt%) were obtained followed by vacuum-drying at 40 °C.
2.3 Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained with a Philips Tecnai 20U-Twin high-resolution transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an ESCALAB 2200-XL X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). Absorption spectra were taken on a Hitachi U-3500 UV-vis spectrometer.
2.4 Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) measurements
Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a Pyrex reaction cell connected to a closed gas circulation and evacuation system. The optimised photochemical reaction continued throughout the HER process. In brief, 50 mg of nanocomposites were dispersed in a 100 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.7564 g Na2S and 4.8036 g Na2SO3 as sacrificing agents. The suspension was then thoroughly degassed and irradiated by a Xe lamp (300 W). The temperature of the reactant solution was maintained at 5 °C by flowing water during the reaction. The amount of H2 produced was analysed using online gas chromatography. The activities of the nanocomposites were compared using the average rate of H2 evolution every 5 h.
The photocatalytic quantum efficiency (QE) for H2 evolution was measured using a typical experimental setup. The nanocomposites solution was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp by applying a band-pass filter (420 nm) for 5 h. The average intensity of irradiation was determined by a PL-MW2000 optical power meter (Beijing Perfect light Technology Ltd, China) and the irradiation area is 18.85 cm2. Therefore, QE can be estimated as follows:  
2.5 Photoelectrochemical activity measurements
Photoelectrochemical test systems contained a CHI660D workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China) with a three-electrode configuration using the prepared samples as the working electrodes, a Pt plate as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and a 300 W Xe lamp equipped as the light source. Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.5 M) with 20% lactic acid was used as the electrolyte. The working electrodes were prepared as follows: 10 mg of the as-prepared nanocomposites (0.5 wt%) were dispersed in absolute ethanol, and the suspension was directly deposited onto an indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass plate and then dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven. Electrochemical impedance measurements were performed within a frequency range of 0.1 kHz–100 kHz.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure, morphology and chemical composition characterization
First, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to probe the morphologies of the as-prepared CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites (Fig. 1). Fig. 1a shows the exfoliated BNNSs. According to the SEM image, BNNSs were almost entirely transparent even at a lower accelerating voltage, which demonstrated the ultrathin nature of BNNSs.34Fig. 1b shows the pure CdS, which had a spherical structural with an average diameter of about 50 nm. CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites can be observed in Fig. 1c, d. From the images, the CdS nanostructures were found to grow on the edges and asperities of BNNSs. Therefore, the formation mechanism of the nanocomposites can be understood in terms of the kinetic process of heterogeneous nucleation theory. The growth process of CdS nanoparticles on BNNSs belongs to heterogeneous nucleation, and the surfaces of BNNSs, especially the vacancy defects, serve as low energy barrier centres for the nucleation of new phases.35 In this case, CdS nanoparticles were grown as solid droplets on the surfaces of BNNSs.

Further crystal characterizations for the CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 2 using the HRTEM images. Fig. 2a shows a single BNNS covered by lots of CdS nanoparticles. It can be clearly observed that the CdS nanoparticles grew on the edges and asperities of BNNS, and were consistent with the SEM images. Fig. 2b shows the lattice structure of a part of CdS nanoparticles that grew on the edges of BNNSs. The clear crystalline interplanar spacing on the image was figured out as 0.334 nm, which shows the (002) of CdS. Moreover, the pattern revealed the BNNSs lattice structure. From this image, the lattice of BNNS can be observed distinctly. It shows that the BNNSs remained well-crystallized after the exfoliation process. The distance between the two neighboring bright reflections in the inset of Fig. 2b was 0.258 nm, which perfectly corresponds to the B–B or N–N atom separations in BNNSs. The electron diffraction pattern of CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites is shown as an inset. Because the electron diffraction pattern of the CdS polycrystalline structure was annulus, and the pattern of BNNSs was hexagonal lattice, the image of CdS/BNNSs electron diffraction pattern can be shown as the superposition of the two patterns. From these images, it was proved directly in another way that CdS nanoparticles were in situ grown on BNNSs and closely combined together.

XPS is a particularly useful tool to study the composition and electronic structure of materials. A survey XPS spectrum in Fig. 3a exhibits the detailed peaks of CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites, including O 2s, S 2p, S 2s, C 1s, N 1s, B 1s, and Cd 3d. The peaks of O and C were mainly caused by the silica substrate and surface contamination. As shown in Fig. 3b, a typical high resolution XPS spectrum of Cd 3d is presented. Two peaks at 405.0 and 411.9 eV were assigned to Cd 3 d5/2 and 3 d3/2, which were characteristic peaks of Cd2+ in CdS nanoparticles. As for the high resolution spectrum of N 1s (Fig. 3c), the small peak at 397.7 eV was attributed to N 1s. This peak was not clear because of the low amount of BNNSs (about 0.5 wt%) in the nanocomposites, which was the same as the peak of B 1s in Fig. 3d.36 The XPS spectrum of the B 1s region can be fitted into two peaks: 190.7 eV and 191.6 eV, which correspond to B–N and B–O, respectively (Fig. 3d).37Fig. 3e shows the XPS spectrum of the S 2p region, which can be fitted into two peaks: 162.7 eV and 164.0 eV. The peak at 162.7 eV was corresponding to the S2− in CdS nanoparticles,38,39 and the appearance of the peak at 164.0 eV can be speculated to be the new chemical bond during the in situ growth progress. Because the binding energy of S 2p shifts slightly higher, the formation of the S–O bond is predicted. The XPS results further confirm the coexistence of BNNSs and CdS nanoparticles in the nanocomposites. The slight shift of S 2d and B 1s shows the presumed presence of B–O–S chemical bonds between CdS and BNNSs. These new chemical bonds may have contributed to the broader spectral response range and effective electronic communication between BNNSs and CdS.

Furthermore, the crystal structure of the as-obtained products was investigated by XRD. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of these products. The abovementioned two patterns show the XRD of BNNSs and pristine h-BN powder. These two lines show the diffraction peaks of the as-prepared BNNSs and pristine BN powder corresponding to the (002), (100) and (004) planes of the hexagonal BN, with lattice constants of a = 0.2504 nm and c = 0.6656 nm (JCPDS card 34-0421). It should be noted that no impurities were detected in the first blue line, which indicated that the as-prepared BNNSs were pure. Moreover, it was interesting to note that the peaks of BNNSs became weaker than that of pristine BN powder, and the other diffractions such as (110) and (102) almost disappeared, which led one to speculate that the (002) and (004) crystal faces of BNNSs were exposed, and the BNNSs were exfoliated from the precursor BN powder along the (002) plane without destroying its crystalline structure.40 The bottom black line was the pure CdS nanoparticles, the diffraction peaks were well indexed to crystal planes of a hexagonal phase CdS (JCPDS no. 41-1049). Moreover, the diffraction peaks of the CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites (0.5 wt% and 10 wt%) were also well indexed to the crystal planes of hexagonal phase CdS. These results clearly demonstrated that the CdS component in the nanocomposites was formed into a pure hexagonal phase with high crystallinity. For 0.5 wt% CdS/BNNSs, no clear characteristic diffraction peaks for BNNSs were observed because of the low amount of BNNSs. It can be observed that all the characteristic peaks of CdS and BNNSs are present without new peaks in the 10 wt% CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites, indicating there was no new phase produced in the preparation process.

Characterization of the as-obtained products was also investigated by FTIR and Raman spectra. All the spectral results further confirm the coexistence of BNNSs and CdS in the nanocomposites and are consistent with the abovementioned results (see ESI† S1 and S2).
3.2 Photocatalytic H2 evolution
BNNSs exhibited an excellent influence on photocatalytic activity (Fig. 5). Fig. 5a shows the rates of H2 evolution on CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites with different amounts of BNNSs. Even with a small amount of BNNSs, the H2 evolution rate was noticeably increased. As shown in Fig. 5, no H2 was evolved when BNNS was used as the catalyst alone, suggesting that BNNSs were inactive for photocatalytic H2 evolution. CdS nanoparticles alone showed activity for photocatalytic H2 evolution, but compared with other compositions, the activity was low (188.2 μmol h−1 g−1, quantum efficiency of 0.30% at 420 nm). In the presence of a small amount of BNNSs (0.1 wt%), the rate of H2 evolution on CdS/BNNSs was increased to 297.9 μmol h−1 g−1, perhaps because the amount of BNNSs was not large enough to efficiently load all the CdS nanoparticles. With the increase of the amount of BNNSs in nanocomposites, the rate of H2 evolution on CdS/BNNSs was further increased and reached the maximum when the amount of BNNSs was 0.5 wt%. The rate of H2 evolution on CdS/BNNSs at the optimum loading was 2.3 times higher than that on CdS nanoparticles alone. The corresponding H2 evolution rate reached 439.4 μmol h−1 g−1 with an apparent quantum efficiency of 0.73% at 420 nm. Further addition of BNNSs in the nanocomposites led to a decrease in photocatalytic H2 evolution. In particular, at the BNNSs amount of 1.5 wt%, the photocatalytic activity of CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites decreased to 155.5 μmol h−1 g−1. Excess loading of BNNSs could considerably block the absorption of the incident light by CdS, and recombination centers may be introduced at high loadings, which could be another factor leading to decreased activity.41 As a consequence, a suitable content of BNNSs is crucial for optimizing the photocatalytic activity of CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites.

Photocatalytic reaction conditions: 50 mg of the nanocomposites, 100 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.7564 g Na2S and 4.8036 g Na2SO3 and 300 W Xe lamp. 
To investigate the stability of CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites, photocatalytic reactions were repeated for several cycles. The reaction system was evacuated every 5 h. As is shown in Fig. 5b, the rate of H2 evolution on CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites decreased slightly with every reaction cycle. Therefore, the photo-corrosion of CdS during the photocatalytic reactions was supposed to be the main reason for the decreased activity with reaction time, which is known to be a major problem for metal sulfide photocatalysts.42
For further study of the photocatalytic performance of the CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites, the products that were loaded by Pt were also tested. As shown in Fig. 6, the as-obtained pure CdS, 0.5 wt% CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites was loaded with 0.5% Pt. It can be found that the rates of H2 evolution became much higher when Pt was loaded, mainly due to the excellent electrical conduction performance of the noble metal. Moreover, it was clearly observed that the evolution rate of Pt/CdS/BNNSs still remained much higher than the rate of Pt/CdS, which was consistent with the abovementioned results. The rate of Pt/CdS/BNNSs was 5.961 mmol h−1 g−1 and corresponds to an apparent quantum efficiency of 9.30% (λex = 420 nm). In this regard, the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposites was significantly greater than that of CdS nanoparticles. Although the results showed a relative lower upside potential than other CdS decorated two-dimension nanosheets such as graphene and MoS2 nanosheets,43,44 as a support, BNNSs improves the photocatalytic properties of CdS to a large extent.

Photocatalytic reaction conditions: 50 mg of the nanocomposites, 100 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.7564 g Na2S and 4.8036 g Na2SO3 and 300 W Xe lamp. 
Electrochemical experiments were also conducted to further investigate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. The photocurrent is mainly determined by the electron–hole pair separation efficiency within the photoelectrodes. As shown in Fig. 7, the transient photocurrent responses of pure CdS nanoparticles and the as-obtained 0.5 wt% CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites were recorded for several on–off irradiation cycles. Compared with CdS nanoparticles, the CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites exhibited enhanced photocurrent response, which indicated that the number of photo-generated electrons was greatly increased because of coupling with BNNSs nanosheets. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were adopted to investigate charge transfer and recombination processes at solid/electrolyte interfaces. The diameters of the arc radius on the EIS Nyquist plot of the as-obtained products are shown in Fig. 7b. Smaller diameters imply an effective separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and fast interface charge transfer. It is clear that the CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites are superior to the CdS nanoparticles in carrier separation and charge transfer, and consistent with the HER analysis.

3.3 The mechanism for the photocatalytic H2 evolution
Based on the abovementioned results, the proposed mechanism for photocatalytic H2 production on CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites is shown in the Fig. 8 schematic representation. CdS nanoparticles are grown on the imperfections and edges of BNNSs. On one hand, due to the characteristics of the two-dimensional structure, the nanocomposites can offer a larger specific surface area. More active adsorption sites and photocatalytic reaction centers are provided in this case.45 On the other hand, CdS nanoparticles and BNNSs are connected with each other by chemical bonds, and the novel nanocomposites broaden the photo absorption region of CdS (see ESI† S5). Under photoexcitation, electron and hole pairs are produced in the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of CdS, and there are still photo electrons generated on the BNNSs surface, especially at the imperfections and edges. It is believed that an electronic communication between BNNSs and CdS occurs. The effective electron transport between BNNSs and CdS leads to the enhancement of photocatalytic H2 evolution. The photogenerated holes are consumed by the sacrificing agents. The electrons will transfer to the connected points and surface of CdS to reduce protons to H2. Therefore, the broad photo absorption region and effective electron transport make the enhancement of photocatalytic H2 evolution occur.

4. Conclusions
Unprecedentedly, nanocomposites of CdS nanoparticles and BNNSs were designed and successfully fabricated. The excellent performance of CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites was proved in the field of hydrogen production from water. The in situ growth method was conducted to prepare CdS/BNNSs nanocomposites that were linked together by chemical bonds. The photocatalytic performance of the nanocomposites was studied by comparing with that of pure CdS nanoparticles and the results showed that BNNSs play an important role in improving photocatalytic performance. Under optimum conditions, the rate of H2 evolution can be increased by up to 2.3 times when CdS was loaded with only 0.5 wt% BNNSs and reached 439.4 μmol h−1 g−1. It is supposed that when BNNSs are introduced, the broad spectral response and effective electron transport enhance the photocatalytic H2 evolution. This study suggests that the BNNSs supports can be appealing candidates for the fabrication of various types of BNNSs-based nanocomposites, which will have wide application in the fields of catalysis, environment and new energy materials.
