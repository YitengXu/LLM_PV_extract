    , Accepted 4th November 2016First published on 7th November 2016AbstractBalancing the high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term stability of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs) is a challenging factor for the commercialization of solar cells. Herein, a cost-effective and widely available water-soluble additive, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), has been adopted to improve the film quality of CH3NH3PbI3 and enhance the efficiency and long-term tolerance to humidity. A PCE of 17.4% has been achieved for the device with PVA, showing an 11.6% increase compared to those of the devices without the additive. Most importantly, the unencapsulated devices retain over 90% of their initial efficiency even after 30 days in a high humidity environment (90% relative humidity), exhibiting greater humidity tolerance and superior stability. Our studies present a simple solution-based approach to fabricate high efficiency solar cells with long-term stability under high humidity conditions, potentially revealing new methods for the mass production of Pero-SCs.
Introduction
The supply of energy and the associated environmental impacts are one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. The effective exploitation of renewable energy is an important step towards sustainable energy production and environmental protection. Today, research on solar cells is increasing rapidly as the price of solar cells decreases. Significant efforts have been made towards the development of new and improved photovoltaic materials. In recent studies, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have been shown to be ideal candidates for use in optoelectronic applications, such as photovoltaics,1–4 lasing,5–7 light emitting devices,8,9 and photodetectors,10–12 due to their high absorption coefficients, small exciton binding energy, good ambipolar charge mobility, and long carrier life time and diffusion length. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organolead halide perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs) has been rapidly increased, reaching a new world record of 22.1% (ref. 13) (certified by NERL) from 3.8% (ref. 14) within 6 years, an unprecedented advance in the field of photovoltaics. Numerous methods, such as solvent engineering,15,16 interface modification,17,18 compositional tuning,19 selection of efficient charger transport materials,20–23 and device architecture design,4,24,25 have been investigated as means of improving the quality and uniformity of perovskite films, leading to enhancements in the efficiency of Pero-SCs. Among these methods, adding polymer additives including PVP, PEI and P(VDF-TrFE) into perovskite films seems to be an easy and effective method to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells. Guo et al. have introduced PVP into perovskite films to improve the device's performance and stability together.26 Besides efficiency, long-term stability is another important factor for solar cells. However, CH3NH3PbI3 is moderately sensitive to moisture and prone to decompose into CH3NH3I and PbI2 when exposed to humidity,27 which results in the diminished performance of Pero-SCs.28–32 To date, several methods have been adopted to improve the tolerance of perovskite materials to humidity. For example, Kwon and colleagues have used hydrophobic hole transport materials for encapsulation to prevent ambient humidity from penetrating into the device.33 Lei et al. have modified perovskite/Al2O3 mesostructured solar cells and improved the stability of devices, with greater than 72% of the initial PCE retained after 250 days of exposure to 40% relative humidity (RH).29 Yang's group has designed and fabricated a novel perovskite solar cell with a porous scaffold of TiO2/ZrO2, which retains a PCE of 10.5% after more than 1000 h under ambient conditions.34 Recently, devices with a self-healing functionality when exposed to moisture have also attracted significant attention.35 Due to the application of these devices in areas with both highly variable and high humidity (coastal and plentiful rainfall areas), the stability of devices under exposure to these conditions is especially important for commercial devices. There are only a few reports about the long-term stability of Pero-SCs under high humidity (up to 100% RH). Thus, the development of novel methods for the synthesis of high efficiency organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells that exhibit long-term stability in high humidity environments is desirable.
Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is used in water treatment due to its desirable water adsorption properties. PVA polymers are water soluble, function as dispersants and flocculation and thickening agents, may be used in chelation and adhesion, and exhibit a high degree of chemical resistance.36–39 In the field of organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells, it has been reported that if the precursor solution is doped with a polymer additive, it may lead to improved perovskite morphologies and photovoltaic performance.35,40,41 Inspired by these previous studies, in this work we report the use of PVA as a water-soluble polymer additive in the fabrication of perovskite devices via a one-step spin coating process. Similar to the long chain structure and hygroscopicity of previously reported polymer additives,35 the linear PVA results in a positive effect on the stability of perovskite solar cells. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.4% has been obtained by the addition of PVA into the precursor solutions of the perovskite, a superior value compared to devices without additives (15.6%). Furthermore, the unencapsulated Pero-SCs demonstrate excellent water-resistance performance and superior long-term stability, even in environments of 90% RH.
Results and discussion
The planar-type perovskite structure has been adopted in this work owing to its simple and reliable architecture for processing. The configuration is FTO/compact TiO2 (c-TiO2)/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, as shown in Fig. 1a. To investigate the effect of PVA on the surface morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films, precursor solutions with three different concentrations of PVA (0, 2, and 3 mg mL−1) were prepared. Fig. 1b–d show the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films with different concentrations of PVA. The pristine perovskite film exhibits sparse crystal grains (Fig. 1b), which may be detrimental to charge transport. Compact crystal grains with negligible pinholes are obtained via addition of PVA (Fig. 1c and d). The uniformity of the films with PVA can also be confirmed from the SEM images with a large scale bar as shown in Fig. S1,† which is known to be beneficial in the formation of highly efficient devices. The cross-sectional SEM images reveal that the addition of PVA does not alter the thickness of the perovskite films formed under the same conditions, as shown in Fig. S2.†Fig. 1e shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films. It can be seen that all major diffraction peaks are indexed to CH3NH3PbI3, and the lack of additional peaks is indicative of the purity of the sample. Moreover, the intensities of the major peaks increased with addition of PVA, demonstrating an improved degree of crystallinity. The average crystal sizes (intrinsic crystal size) of different films are 23.6, 24.1, and 25.2 nm, respectively, obtained from the Scherrer equation (eqn (1)), where D is the mean size of the ordered (crystalline) domains, K is a dimensionless shape factor, β is the line broadening at half the maximum intensity (FWHM), and θ is the Bragg angle. These results are in line with the above results. D = Kλ/(βcosθ)(1)

Raman spectroscopy was used to ascertain whether the PVA has incorporated into the film, and the spectra are shown in Fig. S3.† It is clear that the Raman shifts of the perovskite samples with PVA are different from those of the pristine sample, indicative of the presence of PVA. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) have also been obtained to confirm the presence of the organic functional group of PVA (Fig. 2a). The characteristic peaks of PVA appear at wavenumbers of 1094 cm−1 (stretching vibration of C–O) and 2935 cm−1 (stretching vibration of –CH2), while the bare CH3NH3PbI3 exhibits peaks at wavenumbers of 3433 cm−1, 3112 cm−1, and 909 cm−1. For the sample of CH3NH3PbI3 with PVA, the stretching vibration of C–O red-shifted to 1023 cm−1, and –CH2 red-shifted to 2931 cm−1,42 which is consistent with the pure PVA. These results are in line with the Raman results, indicating that PVA was successfully incorporated into the perovskite films and led to an improved quality and crystallinity of the perovskite films. High quality films decrease the recombination of charge carriers, which would further lead to increased device efficiency.

Fig. 2b shows the UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the perovskite films added with different concentrations of PVA. It can be seen that the absorption is greater at shorter wavelengths with increasing PVA contents, while they exhibit similar absorption band gaps, suggesting that the addition of PVA can enhance the light absorption properties. Photoluminescence (PL) mapping was adopted to investigate the PL lifetimes and qualities of the films as shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the fluorescence images of perovskite films with different concentrations of PVA exhibit obviously different colors, and the film with PVA shows much more bright regions, indicating a much longer carrier lifetime than the pristine one,43 which is an extremely important factor for photovoltaic devices. To further understand the influence of the additive PVA on devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to study the charge transport and recombination mechanism. Fig. 4 shows the Nyquist plots recorded under standard one sun illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) at the bias voltage of 0.8 V. The semicircle in the high-frequency range is attributed to the charge transfer resistance (RCT) at the hole transporting layer. Rs is regarded as the series resistance of the electrodes and the external circuit, which is equal to the value of the high-frequency intercept on the real axis. The right incomplete semicircle in the low-frequency range is a transmission line, which is mainly attributed to the recombination resistance (Rrec) between the perovskite film and the TiO2 film.40,41,44,45 It can be seen that, from the Nyquist plots in Fig. 4, the RCT value of the perovskite solar cell with PVA (2 mg mL−1, 3 mg mL−1) is lower than that of the pristine devices, indicative of a higher charge transfer rate and would be expected to further lead to a higher device performance.

A systematic investigation of the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite materials was performed. Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves of all devices, and the key parameters are summarized in Table 1. It is found that the performance of the Pvs-SCs is significantly influenced by the addition of a certain amount of PVA. The optimal concentration of PVA is 2 mg mL−1, which gives the highest PCE of 17.41% (Voc = 1.02 V, Jsc = 22.76 mA cm−2 and FF = 74.73% (the forward scan curve is shown in Fig. S4†)), revealing an 11.6% increase compared to those of the devices without the additive (Voc = 0.99 V, Jsc = 22.13 mA cm−2 and FF = 71.21%). Although more PVA will lead to a much more stable film from moisture (the SEM image and XRD pattern are shown in Fig. S5; the device stability is shown in Fig. S6†), further addition of PVA (5 mg mL−1) will decrease the device performance (14.3% efficiency), as shown in Fig. S7,† which might be due to the insulating characteristics of PVA. Therefore, only optimal amounts of PVA show positive effects on the device and there should be a synergic effect between the improvement of the device performance and the blocking of the transportation of the carriers. Fig. 5b shows the device statistics of more than 100 cells with different concentrations of PVA (pristine (0 mg mL−1), 2 mg mL−1 and 3 mg mL−1). It can be seen that the distribution of efficiencies for devices with PVA is narrower and greater (the average PCE is 16.89%) than that of the devices without the additive (the average PCE is 15.49%). These results indicate that adding the optimal amount of PVA will significantly increase the performance of perovskite solar cells. The improved efficiency may be associated with the compact crystal grains and improved crystallinity, which can help facilitate the separation of charge carriers and block the recombination pathways between charge transport materials.46 As introduced earlier, the stability of the devices is another key factor for their future commercialization. The stability and humidity tolerance of the devices without encapsulation were investigated, as shown in Fig. 5c. It can be seen that the PCE of the device without PVA was dramatically reduced to 0 after only 5 days under 85–95% RH, indicative of the rapid decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3. However, the devices with PVA retained more than 90% of their initial PCE even after 30 days under the same conditions (85–95% RH, and the RH values are highlighted in Fig. S8†), demonstrating superior stability and high tolerance to humidity. After careful observation of Fig. 5c, one can see that the efficiency of the devices with PVA decreased by a small amount during the first 5 and 9 days, respectively. However, the efficiency recovered to almost the same values of their initial PCE during the subsequent time (15 days), indicating that perovskite films with PVA may exhibit the same self-healing function under ambient conditions as previously reported results.35

In order to determine the mechanism behind the high PCE and stability at high humidity, we investigated the wettability of the precursor solutions with different concentrations of PVA, as shown in Fig. S9.† The contact angle (CA) decreased with the addition of PVA, indicating an improved surface contact upon adding PVA between the precursor solution and the substrate, leading to the formation of much more uniform films and resulting in highly efficient devices. We have performed XRD measurements on the perovskite films stored at room temperature in a high humidity (90% RH) and dark environment without any protection for 30 days, as shown in Fig. 5d. The existence of a peak at 12.7° is characteristic of the formation of the PbI2 phase, revealing that the film without PVA decomposed into PbI2 completely after 30 days. Notably, while the peak of PbI2 can still be found in perovskite films with PVA, the perovskite crystal phase remains intact and the peak intensity of PbI2 is significantly lower than that of the control film, indicating that PVA can inhibit the decomposition process of perovskite materials under high humidity. Additionally, one can also see that the peak at 12.7° is dramatically decreased with increasing concentration of PVA, indicating that the improved crystallinity of the perovskite is retained with more PVA. As depicted in Fig. S10,† the pristine perovskite films can be seen to discolor after 15 days, exhibiting a yellow tinge, while the films with PVA are minimally changed even after 30 days under the same conditions. These results show that the stability of the devices and their tolerance to humidity can be improved significantly with the addition of PVA in perovskite films.
The above results indicate that the addition of PVA into perovskite films can enhance the tolerance to moisture, which leads to an improved stability in photovoltaic devices. However, the precise mechanism for the device stability arising from PVA is still to be elucidated. Hydroxyl groups, which can be bonded with water molecules through hydrogen bonds, play the role of a hydrophilic group, however the adsorbed water molecules can escape owing to weaker van der Waals forces. As for PVA, it is proposed that the entangled polymer molecules can form a network into which hydrophilic groups may be bent47 as shown in Fig. 6. Generally, the water molecules adsorbed by PVA can be classified into three groups. The first layer of adsorption results from hydrogen bonding or coordination bonding between the hydrophilic hydroxyl group and a water molecule. The second and third layers arise mainly due to hydrogen bonds between the hydrated water and water molecules. These layers are named non-freezing water, freezing bound water and free water, respectively.48 The multi-layer adsorption makes PVA both adsorb and retain water simultaneously. This characteristic of PVA leads to strongly competitive adsorption on water, leading to a layer of water resistance within the perovskite materials. Therefore, most of the water molecules will be adsorbed by PVA instead of the perovskite materials when the film or device is exposed to moisture under the ambient atmosphere, leading to the observed long-term stabilities. A deeper understanding of the mechanism is beyond the scope of this work; however further studies employing theoretical calculations may reveal the mechanism behind the favorable effects of the PVA additive.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a facile approach to prepare perovskite solar cells with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long term stability in high humidity by adding a water soluble polymer (polyvinyl alcohol, PVA). The film with longer carrier lifetimes, lower series resistance and compact crystal grains can be obtained by adding an optimal amount of PVA, which results in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.4%, an increase of 11.6% compared to that of the cell without the additive. Moreover, the PCE of the unsealed cells retains more than 90% of their initial level even after 30 days in a high humidity environment (around 90% RH), clearly demonstrating their tolerance to humidity and superior stability. These findings reveal a new route towards the development of high efficiency perovskite devices with long-term stability under high humidity.
