In this work we report a novel low toxicity and environmentally friendly aqueous organic ionic conductor (AOIC) for high efficiency DSSCs. This study presents the effect of water on the photocurrent density (Jsc) and stability of DSSCs. Interestingly we have also found that the addition of water to the OICs strongly alters the flat band potential (Efb) of nano-crystalline TiO2, hinders the recombination at the TiO2–AOIC interface and positively shifts the redox potential of I−/I3−. Under 1 sun illumination, OICs with 3-methoxypropionitrile solvent and OICs in water show a PCE of 6.02% and 3.57% respectively. This reduced PCE and J–V characteristics are attributed to the negative influence of water on the electron lifetime, electron recombination kinetics and the dark current. Substituting the electron withdrawing group present in the para-position of pyridinium salts mitigates the toxicity and enhances the cationic effect in the electrolyte. The DSSCs fabricated using AOICs showed excellent stability for more than 20 days.
Introduction
In the last two decades dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have gained impetus owing to their several advantages over conventional photovoltaic cells (PV), such as good plasticity, simple fabrication procedure, low fabrication cost and environmental friendliness.1 Generally, a conventional DSSC construction consists of a photoanode (e.g. ZnO or nanocrystalline TiO2), sensitizers (Ru based and metal free), a counter electrode (Pt) and electrolytes (e.g. an I−/I3− redox mediator in organic solvent). Of these, the redox electrolyte plays an important role in regenerating the excited sensitizer molecules. The liquid I−/I3− redox electrolyte is the most common and it shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 11% at 100 mW cm−2 light intensity.2 Conventional electrolytes contain a redox couple in organic solvents such as 3-methoxypropionitrile and acetonitrile which are volatile and toxic.3 In these cases, electrolyte leakage could lead to explosions and cause degradation of the environment, thus limiting their practical applications. In addition to this, the sustainability of the solar cell is limited. Hence considerable work has been done on replacing organic solvent based liquid electrolytes with water based electrolytes.4–7 It is highly desirable to have an aqueous based DSSC as it will be less expensive and environmentally friendly. Earlier attempts at developing aqueous electrolyte based DSSCs were achieved using polymer gels,8 thixotropic polymer gels,7 TEMPOL derivatives9 and RTILs.10 In 2012, A. J. Frank and co-workers investigated the influence of water on the relationship between charge carrier dynamics and the stability and PCE of the device. They demonstrated a high PCE (6.8%) by using 10% water in organic solvents.4 O'Regan et al. achieved a PCE of 2.4% by using a completely water based electrolyte containing 2.0 M PMII, 0.05 M I2, 10 mM GuSCN and 50 mM TBP.4
In a study performed by Park et al.7 the conventional liquid electrolyte was replaced by a thixotropic polymeric gel (xanthan gum) and the influence of water content on the redox potential of the electrolyte, the long term stability and the conduction band edge of nanocrystalline TiO2 was investigated. Numerous articles have been published on water based electrolytes combined with environmentally friendly and low toxicity polymer gels. However, high viscosity, non-uniform filling of the mesoporous TiO2 matrix and low conductivities of the gels substantially reduce the PCE of these devices. Besides all this, aqueous ionic conductors employing ionic liquids such as PMII, DMPII, HDMII etc. have shown a PCE of ∼3 to 3.5%.4,11–14 The many changes associated with the addition of water include shifting the conduction band edge of the semiconducting layer which enhances the open circuit voltage (Voc) and causes a reduction in the short circuit current (Jsc). Additionally, the presence of water enables the adhesion of water molecules to the surface of the semiconducting layer which prevents recombination of electrons at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface.15,16 In this article, we have designed and synthesized pyridinium chalcone based organic ionic conductors (PyCh-1 and PyCh-2) for application in aqueous DSSCs. Generally, pyridine based derivatives are used as additives in electrolytes which enhance the overall PCE and fill factor (FF) of photovoltaic devices. Herein we demonstrate the applicability of pyridine derivatives as aqueous organic ionic conductors (AOICs) which show high conductivity and an enhanced cationic effect. The enhancement in conductivity and cationic effect is brought about by substituting electron withdrawing groups on the pyridine moiety. Moreover, these ionic conductors exhibit low toxicity and are environmentally friendly when compared to other available conventional I−/I3− based electrolytes. We report the photovoltaic characterization of DSSCs fabricated using aqueous electrolytes with varying water content (0%, 10%, 20%, 50% and 100% which are denoted as W0, W10, W20, W50 and W100 respectively) in 3-methoxypropionitrile. These low toxicity OICs with pure water (W100) exhibit photocurrents of 8.16 mA cm−2 and 7.40 mA cm−2 and achieve PCEs of 3.46% and 3.57% for PyCh-1 and PyCh-2, respectively. Fig. 1a compares recent reports on 100% water based electrolytes in DSSCs. All of the given PCE values are in the presence of additives (i.e. I2, LiI, GuSCN and TBP).

However, multicomponent water based electrolytes exhibit increasing complexity, which is not beneficial for tuning of components in DSSC devices. Z. S. Wang et al. were the first to report N-substituted propargyl IMI based single component ionic conductors in solid state DSSCs with a PCE of 6.3%.17 To further enhance the PCE they modified the OICs by substituting various functional groups (i.e. ester and hydroxyethyl, phenyl and thienyl) with IMI.18–20 However all of the above-mentioned OICs were used for solvent free solid state DSSC application. Here in this work, we have fabricated DSSCs without adding any additives, single component AOICs, which exhibit 0.9% (PyCh-1) and 0.7% (PyCh-2) PCEs. A metal free organic D–π–A dye (SK3, Fig. 1b) was used as a sensitizer in the photovoltaic devices and it has excellent stability in aqueous based electrolytes.21,22 The effect of water based electrolytes on the shifting of the Efb of titania and redox potential of iodide/triiodide was measured using various electrochemical techniques and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the stability of the DSSCs was compared without (W0) and with (W100) water based ionic conductors up to 20 days.
Results and discussion
The detailed synthesis protocol of organic ionic conductor (OIC) based electrolytes is shown in the ESI.† The chemical structures of the synthesized ionic conductors were confirmed by 13C & 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1 and S2†). The thermo-oxidative stabilities of the OICs were measured using thermogravimetric analysis with a nitrogen flow of 60 ml min−1, at temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 300 °C and a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and the results are depicted in Fig. S3.† It can be evidently seen that the melting points of the OICs are >100 °C. A decomposition temperature of ∼145 °C is quite comparable with the conventional electrolytes used for DSSCs, ensuring applicability of these OICs for photovoltaic applications. Conductivity of the electrolyte is another important parameter which affects the PCE of a PV device.31 The conductivities of the synthesized OICs (PyCh-1 and PyCh-2) were determined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The Nyquist plot of the ionic conductors is given in Fig. S4† and the intercept of the inclined line on the X-axis (real) at higher frequency (Hz) was considered as R (resistance).32,33 The σ of the ionic conductors was calculated using the following eqn (1) and the trend is shown in Fig. 2a. σ = L/RS(1)
 Fig. 2  (a) Conductivity of OICs with various water contents, (b) cyclic voltammetry of PyCh-1 and PyCh-2 ionic conductors, and (c) toxicity results of OICs with reference electrolytes. 
The decrease in ionic conductivities of the OICs upon water addition is attributed to the degradation of iodine or bromide groups due to oxidation or degradation, as confirmed by the Raman spectrum (Fig. S5†). The presence of iodine (112, 149, and 224 cm−1) and bromide (302 and 281 cm−1) in the OICs can be inferred from the Raman spectrum.
To investigate the interfacial compatibility of the OIC electrolytes and catalytic activity on the Pt-counter electrode, cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were carried out in a three electrode (Pt-wire as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode) system. As shown in Fig. 2b, the negative current and positive current peaks correspond to the reduction and oxidation reaction of I3−/I−. In both the electrolytes (PyCh-1 and PyCh-2) sequential redox reactions of 3I− → I3− + 2e− and 2I3− → 3I2 + 2e− were observed.
Toxicity screening measurement
The toxicity measurements for the organic ionic conductors were obtained using a brine shrimp technique and antimicrobial activity employed in previously reported studies.34,35 From the summarized data depicted in Fig. 2c (calculation and method given in Fig. S6 and Table S1, ESI†) the LC50 values of the OICs are 28.57 μg mL−1 (PyCh-1) and 15.99 μg mL−1 (PyCh-2) while the measured LC50 values of conventional electrolytes 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMIMI) and pyridinium iodide (PyI) are higher when compared to the OICs. The LC50 value is inversely proportional to toxicity and hence the synthesized OICs show low toxicity when compared to conventional electrolytes. The antimicrobial activity was analyzed against bacterial strains E. coli and B. subtilis (Gram-negative (Gram −ve) and Gram-positive (Gram +ve) respectively). The toxicity of the OICs was measured based on the bacterial growth inhibition in a one day assay and the calculated IC50 (inhibitory concentration) value. The results show that BMIMI electrolyte (50–100 μm) has higher toxicity than PyCh-1 and PyCh-2 (100–150 μm) ionic conductors in Gram +ve and Gram −ve bacteria. In 2014, Gathergood and co-workers36 reported low toxicity task specific ionic liquid (TSIL) electrolyte by using antibacterial and antifungal toxicity measurements. Compared to that, our reported OICs are more superior, less toxic and environmentally friendly.
Photovoltaic characterization of aqueous DSSCs
Photovoltaic characterization of the aqueous DSSCs was performed under 1 sun illumination and dark conditions. The J–V curves of the devices with varying water content in the electrolyte and sensitized using the metal free organic dye (SK3) are presented in Fig. 3 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1.

It is seen that the short circuit current density (Jsc) and photocurrent efficiency (PCE) decrease with enhanced water content in electrolytes, whereas the open-circuit voltage (Voc) monotonically increases. In PyCh-1 an increase in Voc from 676 mV to 713 mV and in PyCh-2 an increase from 719 mV to 772 mV is observed between W0 and W100 conditions. The two OICs under the W100 condition showed PCEs of 3.46% and 3.57% which are higher as compared to other reported aqueous DSSCs.4,12,37,38 A similar trend is observed in the EQE (external quantum efficiency) graph; without water both electrolyte devices give 2 fold higher EQE percentages compared to the W100 content electrolyte. To visualize the synergetic effect, absorption spectra of the metal free dye (SK3) sensitized on nanocrystalline TiO2 in electrolyte were measured in the DSSC devices. Fig. S7† clearly indicates the overall reduction in absorbance which might be responsible for the water content in electrolytes.
The single component electrolyte of PyCh-1 and PyCh-2 without any water content gives an efficiency of 1.9% (Jsc = 7.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 548 mV, and FF = 42%) and 1.8% (Jsc = 7.33 mA cm−2, Voc = 551 mV, and FF = 44%), respectively. When water concentrations of 50% (W50) and 100% (W100) are mixed in both electrolytes, PCEs of 1.3% and 0.9% are obtained in PyCh-1 and PCEs of 1.4% and 0.7% are obtained in PyCh-2 (Fig. S8, Table S2†). Moreover, the fabricated DSSC device without the substituted pyridinium iodide salt gives a lower PCE (0.8%) compared to our synthesized OICs (Fig. S9†). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to investigate the interfacial charge transfer and electron recombination dynamics at the nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode and water based electrolytes.29,39 Fig. S10† shows the Nyquist plots of DSSCs with varying water content in electrolytes measured under a −0.65 V bias. The EIS spectra can be interpreted by fitting an equivalent circuit, consisting of various elements as explained below. The interfacial resistance (Rct) of electron transfer at the Pt-counter electrode/AIOC interface, recombination resistance (Rrec) in the TiO2 photoanode, diffusion resistance (Rd) in the AOICs and the constant phase element (CPE-P) and its value are associated with the surface roughness and porosity of the TiO2 photoanode.40–43
The calculated Rct of both electrolytes under the W0 condition are PyCh-1 = 21.79 Ω and PyCh-2 = 22.69 Ω. These values are lower when compared to the Rct of the electrolytes with increasing water content. Moreover, the addition of water molecules blocks electron injection from the CB of nanocrystalline TiO2 to FTO and hence the Jsc of the devices reduces as the water content in the electrolyte increases.
The EIS results revealed that the electron transport properties of W0 in the OIC based devices are enhanced which is reflected by the middle semicircle, resulting in Rrec being higher than those of other devices. This indicates that the recombination of electrons between the metal free dye (SK3) sensitized TiO2 photoanode and the organic ionic conductors is hindered. This observation is in good agreement with the noticed efficiency trend with PyCh-1 and PyCh-2 aqueous electrolytes, i.e., W0 > W10 > W20 > W50 > W100. The electron lifetime (τe) for PyCh-1 and PyCh-2 electrolyte based devices is calculated using τe = 1/2πfmax and the values are shown in Table 2.

The decreasing τe from 2.26 to 1.01 in PyCh-1 and from 2.36 to 1.12 in PyCh-2 is in good agreement with the variation of Voc (PyCh-1 = 676–713 mV and PyCh-2 = 719–772 mV) observed in the J–V measurement. Fig. S10† shows the EIS spectra of DSSCs employing AOIC based electrolytes obtained under dark conditions. The electron density (ns) at the steady state in the nanocrystalline TiO2 conduction band is calculated using the equation44  where kB, T, q, A and ns represent the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10−23 J K−1), absolute temperature (298.15 K), charge of a proton (1.602 × 10−19 C), electrode area (0.25 cm2) and electron density at the steady state in the TiO2 conduction band, respectively.

Table 2 shows the ns of all the AOIC based devices; the donor density reduces with increasing the water percentage in ionic conductors. We can conclude that there was a displacement in the TiO2 semiconductor flat band (fb) when electrolytes with various percentages of water content were introduced into the DSSC devices. The decreasing ns means that the injection of electrons also decreases with increasing water percentage, indicating that electrons are lost slowly by recombination, thus resulting in a low PCE.
Influence of water on photovoltaic device parameters

Electrochemistry. 
The presence of various amounts of water in electrolytes shifted the flat band potential of nanocrystalline TiO2 and the redox potential of I−/I3−. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and Mott–Schottky (MS) analysis are excellent tools in understanding the water effect on electrolytes. Fig. S11† shows the typical LSV curves measured using a three electrode system (CE = Pt-wire, WE = nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode and RE = non-aqueous Ag/AgCl) with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. From LSV measurements we can see that the electrochemical reduction potentials of PyCh-1 and PyCh-2 are 0.543 V and 0.188 V respectively under the W0 condition. It can also be seen that the potential shifts up with increasing water content and the measured values under the W100 condition are 0.195 V and 0.068 V for PyCh-1 and PyCh-2. A similar trend in shifting up of the electrochemical reduction potential of the electrolyte on water addition was reported by Mikoshiba et al. in 2002.45,46 Since the HOMO level of the SK3 dye17 is fixed at 1.15 V and the Ered of the electrolyte is shifted positively on water addition, this could affect the regeneration of the dye which is bolstered by the CV measurements (Fig. S12†). The MS analysis behaviour of the TiO2 working electrode with various water content electrolytes was obtained to determine their flat-band potential (Efb) as shown in Fig. 4a. The Efb of the nanocrystalline TiO2 film in a DSSC is very important because the Voc is determined by the difference between the I−/I3− redox couple and Efb of the TiO2 semiconductor (MS details shown in Fig. S13†). A negative shift of the flat band potential (PyCh-1 = −0.66 V to −0.75 V and PyCh-2 = −0.70 V to −0.84 V) in the above figure means a shift away from the redox potential and therefore an increase of Voc.47 Another factor that enhances the Voc in the DSSC devices is that the dye containing acidic proton (–COOH) was transferred to the nanocrystalline TiO2 film upon absorption which led to positive charging of the TiO2 surface and a resultant shift of Efb.48,49
 Fig. 4  (a) Measured Efb of nanocrystalline TiO2 film vs. AOICs by Mott–Schottky analysis, (b) dark J–V curve of DSSCs with the AOICs, (c) the effect of Mulliken charge present on the “nitrogen” atom of the OICs with acetonitrile and water (calculate by TD-DFT), and (d) energy level diagram of aqueous DSSCs showing the influence of water on Efb of TiO2 film and water, acetonitrile and para-position substitution effect on the I−/I3− redox potential. 
The reduction in Jsc with increasing amount of water content in the electrolyte is attributed to the desorption of the dye from the TiO2 surface (dye desorption with respect to time graph shown in Fig. S14†). The presence of water triggers hydrolysis reactions on the surface of the TiO2 photoanode which initiates desorption of the dye molecules.38,50 Therefore, we calculated the diffusion coefficient (Dn) using EIS techniques and conclude that Dn was reduced with increasing amount of water in the electrolyte, which may have an effect on photocurrent density (Fig. S15†).


Dark current (J–V) of aqueous DSSCs. 
The dark current measurement in DSSCs cannot be directly correlated with the back electron transfer process, since potential distribution and electrolyte concentration (with or without water based electrolytes) at the TiO2 photoanode in light are different than those under dark conditions. The comparison of dark current with and without water content in electrolytes provides useful information regarding the back electron transfer process. Therefore, dark current analysis of photovoltaic devices has been mentioned as a qualitative method to explain the extent of the back electron transfer process.51,52Fig. 4b shows the dark J–V curves of the DSSCs with varying water content in the electrolytes up to an applied bias of 700 mV. As the water content in the electrolyte increases, the onset of the J–V curve is shifted to a higher potential. Moreover for the same potential, the dark current magnitude decreases with increased water content. These results show that the addition of water retards the charge recombination and thus the enhancement of Voc and reduction in dark current.


Theoretical calculations. 
In order to explain the clear role of substitution of electron withdrawing groups in pyridinium salts and the effect of different solvents (acetonitrile and water) on a cationic atom (nitrogen), we have done Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) calculations on PyCh-1 and PyCh-2 organic ionic conductors. For convenience, we have optimized the structures without putting a positive charge on the nitrogen atom. In DFT it is not possible to optimize the structures with a positive charge. The optimization is carried out using the LanL2Dz/B3LYP 6-31G basic set. For reference we have taken pyridinium iodide (PyI, without substituted ionic salt) and compared it with our synthesized ionic conductors. In Fig. S16,† we have given an individual atom's Mulliken charge in a vacuum, acetonitrile and water solvents for PyI (unsubstituted, reference electrolyte) and OICs. The summarized data are given in Tables S3–S5.† From the Mulliken charge analysis, it is clear that the solvent environment tends to increase the partial atomic charge on a particular atom. The enhancement of charge is more in the case of acetonitrile in comparison with the water environment suggesting destabilization. A comparison of the Mulliken charge present on the “nitrogen” atom between OICs and PyI is given in Fig. 4c.
From Mulliken charges it is quite evident that nitrogen has more partial atomic charge in OICs which gets stabilized on introduction of the electron withdrawing chalcone group in the para-position. Furthermore, to understand the effect of solvents and withdrawing group substitution on pyridinium salts, cyclic voltammetry was carried out in acetonitrile and water solvents and the voltammograms are shown in Fig. S12.†Fig. 4d shows the energy level diagram of the aqueous photovoltaic device based on the CV and TD-DFT calculations. The Eredox level of PyI (reference electrolyte) is very far from the HOMO level of (−5.32 eV) the metal free D–π–A dye (SK3), while the substituted pyridinium salts (PyCh-1 and PyCh-2) have Eredox levels shifted toward the SK3 dye HOMO level side. This means that substituting the para-position of pyridine with an aromatic group results in faster dye regeneration when compared to PyI electrolytes.

Electron lifetime (τn) and Tafel polarization
The open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) characteristic was measured to understand the origin of the photovoltage in photovoltaic devices based on various amounts of water composition in the electrolyte. The OCVD measurement for monitoring the successive decay of photovoltage (Voc) after turning “OFF” the illumination in a steady state and the suppressed charge recombination at the TCO/AIOC electrolyte interface can also be confirmed using this technique (Fig. S17†).53

Fig. 5a and b show the relationship between the decay rate (Voc) and the electron lifetime (τn), as described by the following equation.54  where kB is the Boltzmann constant, e is the positive elementary charge, (dVoc/dt) the derivation of Voc and T is the absolute temperature.
 Fig. 5  (a and b) Electron lifetime (τn) as a function of Voc of the aqueous DSSCs with AOICs and (c) stability of the DSSCs based on W0 and W100 water content in PyCh-1 and PyCh-2 electrolytes. 
The τn can be extracted from the initial slope of the Voc decay curves in the OCVD measurements (Fig. S17†). Fig. 5a and b compare the results of the dependence of τn on the Voc for DSSCs with and without water content in the electrolytes. We concluded that, at any given Voc, the τn for the water device has a lower value than that without the water device. The Tafel polarization method is used to get better insight into the recombination dynamics of the DSSC device thereby getting an exact idea about the increase in Voc and interfacial charge transfer properties of the electrolyte (I−/I3−) redox couple in the TiO2 photoanode (Fig. S18†).55,56 The nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode in the photovoltaic devices and the rate of cathodic (αc) and anodic (αa) reactions at the photoanode and electrolyte interface can be expressed by the Butler–Volmer equation:57,58J = −J0(expαcnF/RT(E − Eeq) − expαanF/RT(E − Eeq))where J0 is the current exchange density, n is the number of electrons transferred, J is the total current density, E is the applied voltage and Eeq is the equilibrium potential of the redox couple in the electrolyte (dark condition J = J0 as E = Eeq).
The J0 was calculated from the intersection of the linear cathodic and anodic branches of the Tafel graph.β = 2.303RT/αFwhere the Tafel slope, β, is proportional to 1/α. For the without water PyCh-1 and PyCh-2 electrolytes, J0 for the redox (I−/I3−) couple at the TiO2 photoanode and electrolyte interface was about 9.2 × 10−8 A cm−2 and 8.3 × 10−8 A cm−2 respectively. This was much high than that of the DSSC device based on the all water content electrolytes. The decreasing J0 with increasing water content in the electrolytes suggests that the presence of water reduces the electrochemical reaction rate of triiodide reduction.
The without water (W0) electrolyte has a higher βc value than the water electrolyte (W100) based DSSCs as shown in Table 2. The decreasing cathodic slope under the W100 condition indicates increased reaction of the triiodide at the dye/TiO2/OIC interface, while a higher anodic slope indicates reduced reaction of iodide at the dye/TiO2/OIC interface.

Stability. 
The effect of water content in the electrolytes on the overall stability of DSSCs has been studied systematically under the illumination of 1 sun light (100 mW cm−2). Fig. S19† shows the stability of the PCE as a function of time (days) for DSSCs with W0 and W100 water content electrolytes. It shows that the devices are stable up to 20 days. The Jsc and Voc stability graphs are presented in ESI Fig. S19.† From the data we can see that the presence of water in the electrolyte decreases the PCE of the device. The Voc and Jsc of the W0 device are quite stable whereas there is a significant reduction in those of the W100 device. An efficiency drop of ∼10% is observed in the device containing water in the electrolyte after a period of 20 days. To the best of our knowledge, these are the most stable water based electrolyte (OICs in W100) DSSCs reported to date.

Conclusions
To summarize, highly conducting, thermally stable, low toxicity and effective single component OICs are synthesized and used as aqueous electrolytes in photoelectrochemical solar cells. The influence of water on DSSCs fabricated using both PyCh-1 and PyCh-2 electrolytes was investigated. We observed that the addition of water to the electrolytes enhances the Voc and reduces the Jsc. The enhancement in Voc is attributed to a negative shift in the flat band potential of TiO2 and positive shift in the electrolyte redox potential. The reduced Jsc is due to desorption of the dye from the semiconductor surface and decreasing diffusion coefficient. Additionally, the toxicity of the AOICs is less when compared to conventional iodine based electrolytes. Under the ‘no water’ condition we achieved PCEs of 5.61% and 6.02% in PyCh-1 and PyCh-2 OICs. The single component devices gave PCEs of 1.9% (PyCh-1) and 1.8% (PyCh-2). We have also shown that the stability of the DSSCs is exceptionally high for up to 20 days. This opens up new opportunities for the development of electrolytes for 3rd generation solar cells.
