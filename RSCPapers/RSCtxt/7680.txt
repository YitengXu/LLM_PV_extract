    , Accepted 8th December 2019First published on 11th December 2019AbstractWe report on new sources of selenium for the synthesis of semiconductor nanoparticles of the AIIBVI type. Three types of Se-precursors were synthesized and studied: selenophene derivatives, dialkylselenides and dialkyldiselenides. The capabilities of the new precursors were examined in a phosphorus-free synthesis by the non-injection method. In different conditions, we managed to synthesize nanoparticles of different shapes depending on the used Se-precursors and growth stabilizers. Aminoselenophene derivatives showed the most promising results in the synthesis of CdSe QDs providing a high reaction yield (up to 82%) of NPs with good luminescence properties. We also found that liquid dialkyldiselenides could successfully replace a TOP-Se precursor in the synthesis of highly bright CdSe/CdS quantum rods with narrow photoluminescence. The proposed selenium precursors, being easily available and very stable, are promising alternatives to the highly toxic air-sensitive phosphine-based precursors and unstable Se–ODE solutions in the non-injection synthesis of different kinds of semiconductor nanoparticles, which is particularly important for industrial scale production.
Introduction
Nowadays, luminescent semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) are known as rapidly evolving materials that have already found their applications in a variety of photonic devices. The global market of quantum dots has already totalled more than a billion USD and should total over $7.8 billion by 2022, demonstrating an enormous annual growth rate.1 Despite the fact that the products based on quantum dot (QD) technology, e.g., visual displays, lasers, and LEDs, have already been introduced to the global market, there is still a need for the elaboration of new reliable techniques for the synthesis of this type of nanoparticles on an industrial scale.2 Although InP-based3–5 and perovskite6,7 emissive materials are currently of considerable interest, cadmium selenide (CdSe)-based QDs are still the most commonly used materials due to high quantum efficiency and stable optical properties tunable within the full visible spectral range.8–10
Currently, the most efficient method for the fabrication of CdSe NPs is the colloidal nanosynthesis, i.e. precursor thermolysis in organic media.11 The injection method is considered more efficient in terms of QD spectral properties, whereas the non-injection method is technologically more convenient with respect to mass and power efficiency.12 Cadmium alkylcarboxylates are mainly used as Cd-precursors, which replaced the previously used dangerous dialkyl cadmium13,14 in the synthesis of Cd-based QDs. The coordinating solvent, trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), was replaced with coordinating growth stabilizers/ligands (fatty acids, alkylamines) in high-boiling non-coordinating solvents, such as 1-octadecene (ODE),11,15 diesel16 or even olive oil.17
Regarding Se-precursors, phosphinoselenides are the most commonly used intermediates.11,12,18 They are usually prepared by the reaction of the corresponding phosphines with elemental selenium. In addition to the high cost and toxicity of the starting phosphines, phosphinoselenides are sensitive to moisture and oxygen, and therefore, are not suitable for long-term storage.19 Alternative Se-precursors are solutions of selenium in ODE. One of the main drawbacks of Se–ODE is the low reproducibility of reagent properties because of its instability with time and strong dependence of its reactivity on the method of synthesis.19 Besides, Se–ODE provides limited operating concentrations because of low selenium solubility in ODE even at high temperatures. Other derivatives of selenium (selenoureas,20–25 selenosemicarbazide,26 SeO2,27,28 selenodiazole,29 and dialkyldiselenides30) were also proposed for the synthesis of CdSe NPs though they have found limited applications. In particular, the use of extremely diluted solutions of selenoureas (<2.5 mmol L−1) was reported for the synthesis of CdSe quantum dots20–25 or mixed-shape NPs.21 Selenodiazole derivatives29 resulted only in small “magic-sized” NPs with weak luminescence properties, and no quantum yields (QY) were reported. Using different reductants with SeO2 either prior27 or during the synthesis,28 QDs were produced, although no data about reaction yields and, thereby, precursor performance were reported. Some commercially available short-chain dialkyldiselenides were also shown to be applicable for the synthesis of CdSe nanocrystals,30 although neither PL properties nor reaction yields were reported. Nevertheless, a strong dependence of nanoparticle morphology on the C–E bond strength was shown in examples of disulfides, indicating that the fine modification of a precursor molecular structure can result in different reactivity and, consequently, provide nanomaterials with different practically important properties. Thus, a further elaboration of safe, stable and convenient sources of selenium in the synthesis of luminescent NPs is vital for the future growth of quantum dot/rod market and their applications.
Experimental
Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without purification. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker-400 (400 MHz) spectrometer in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 using the signals of residual solvent protons as internal standards. Mass spectra were recorded on a Varian 1200L GC-MS instrument either in GC-MS mode or with the use of the direct exposure probe (DEP) method with EI at 70 eV. All TGA measurements were performed on a Mettler TA3000 thermo analytical system in inert atmosphere (N2) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Absorption and photoluminescence spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 25 UV/vis spectrometer and Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter, correspondingly. A combination of the same instruments was used for the measurements of quantum yield. Rhodamine B, Rhodamine 123 or Rhodamine 6G solutions in ethanol were used as standards. The solution concentration was limited to retain absorption less than 0.8 at any wavelength longer than the excitation wavelength, and in general, the absorption at the excitation wavelength was limited to 0.02–0.03. For centrifugation, a Sigma 2-11 instrument was used. Transmittance electron microscopy was performed on a SELMI PEM-125K microscope equipped with a digital camera for imaging. The samples of NP dispersions in a volatile solvent were put on a carbon grid, followed by solvent evaporation. For wide-angle X-ray diffraction measurements, the samples were prepared in film form by spin-coating of NP chloroform solutions (≈30 g L−1). A powder X-ray diffraction system, Model PW1830 (Philips), 2 kW with Cu anode and graphite monochromator, was used. A description of the synthesis of the studied Se-precursors is provided in ESI.†
Comparative syntheses of CdSe nanoparticles using Se-precursors 1–6
In a three-neck flask, cadmium stearate (230 mg, 0.34 mmole), the corresponding Se-precursor (0.24 mmole), oleylamine (2 mL) and ODE (3 mL) were placed. The mixture was thoroughly degassed in Argon atmosphere (evacuation to 20 mbar followed by periodical filling with argon), heated in vacuum to 120 °C, held for 1 h and stirred with periodical filling with Ar. A homogeneous, colourless solution was then filled with argon and heated to 220 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. As the start of the reaction a yellow color appearance was defined. The reaction was terminated when a clearly pronounced first excitonic peak of CdSe NPs at λmax ≥ 530 nm was observed in the absorption spectrum of the reaction mixture. The mixture was cooled down and 10 mL of toluene was added. Then the mixture was transferred to a centrifuge tube, 15 ml of methanol was added, shaken and centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 8 min. The precipitate was decanted and redispersed in 5 mL of toluene (ultrasonication is applied in some cases). This reprecipitation step was repeated twice more. The obtained dispersion in toluene was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes and the resulting supernatant was used for the determination of nanoparticle size (TEM, UV-vis spectroscopy) and photoluminescence properties.
In experiments with oleic acid ligand (instead of oleylamine above) the same quantity (2 mL) was used, and the quantities of all other precursors were kept constant.
Synthesis of elongated (1D) CdSe nanoparticles using selenophene 5
CdO (0.70 g, 5.4 mmole) and HDPA (3.33 g, 10.9 mmole) with 6.3 g of TOPO were loaded into the reaction flask and then heated under Argon flow. The mixture was heated up to 350 °C until it turned optically clear and was kept at this temperature for 5–10 min for CdO dissolution until a colorless transparent solution was formed. Then, it was allowed to cool to room temperature and the obtained solid mixture (Cd–HDPA/TOPO complex) was further used.
The Cd–HDPA/TOPO complex (1.50 g) was loaded into the reaction flask and heated up to 350 °C under Argon flow. Two selenium solutions were separately prepared. In one vial, 67 mg (0.25 mmole) of selenophene 5 and 228 mg of TOPO were mixed, and, in another vial, 400 mg (1.5 mmole) of selenophene 5 was dissolved into a liquid (r.t.) mixture of TOPO/ODE (918 mg of TOPO and 1.2 g ODE). The first selenium solution (preheated to around 100 °C) was then quickly injected into the reaction flask at 360 °C, and the mixture was quickly cooled down to 250 °C for the growth of NRs. The second selenium solution was injected dropwise into the reaction flask by eight separated additions (200 μL each) at equal time intervals (10 min). After both selenium solutions were added into the reaction flask, the reaction was kept at 250 °C for 1 h. After this, the mixture was cooled down to r.t. and 10 mL of toluene was added. The purification was carried out according to the general procedure described above for the comparative syntheses of CdSe nanoparticles using precursors 1–6.
Synthesis of CdSe/CdS quantum rods using dioctyldiselenide 2
CdSe seeds were synthesized according to a known protocol,31 except that a solution of dioctyldiselenide 2 in TOP was used as the Se-precursor instead of TOP-Se. The concentration of 2 in the injection solution was the same as that of TOP-Se in the original work. After the injection of Se-precursor at 360 °C, the synthesis was terminated in 30 seconds. After the precipitation of the seeds from the reaction mixture with methanol (1:1 volume ratio of Tol:MeOH), they were washed once by dissolution in toluene and precipitation with methanol (1:1 ratio). The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in toluene and filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE filter, and the toluene was blown out by a stream of nitrogen. The obtained solid product was dissolved in TOP to form a clear solution with 20.25 mg ml−1 concentration (S1). CdO (Meryer, 99%, 90 mg, 0.7 mmol), hexadecylphosphonic acid (99.95%, 265 mg, 0.86 mmol), hexylphosphonic acid (99.5%, 80 mg, 0.48 mmol) and trioctylphosphine oxide (Stream, 90%, 3.0 g, 7.8 mmol) were degassed by means of vacuum evacuation/filling with N2 sequence (5 times). Then, the suspension was heated to 340 °C upon vigorous stirring when it became a transparent colorless solution (S2). In a separate flask, sulfur (84 mg, 2.6 mmol) was dissolved in TOP (1.6 ml) upon vigorous stirring where to solution S1 (400 μl) was added. The obtained solution was swiftly injected to S2 at 375 °C to initiate the growth of an elongated CdS shell around the CdSe seeds. The synthesis was terminated in 9 min by removing the heating source. Then 10 ml of toluene was added at 180 °C. After cooling to room temperature the product was precipitated with 10 ml of ethanol, collected by centrifugation and washed once by redispersion in toluene (8 ml, 10 min of ultrasonication), followed by precipitation with ethanol (8 ml, centrifugation). The obtained solid product was then redispersed in toluene (5 ml) and centrifugated (4000 rpm, 10 min). The solution was collected and filtered through a 0.2 mkm PTFE filter, and the solvent was blown out by a nitrogen stream at 60 °C to give 105 mg of the product.
Synthesis of CdSe@CdS quantum dots “one pot” using selenophene 4 and thiophene 7
In a three-neck flask, cadmium stearate (230 mg, 0.34 mmole), selenophene 4 (54 mg, 0.24 mmole), thiophene 7 (18 mg, 0.10 mmole), 2 mL of oleylamine and 3 mL of ODE were placed and thoroughly degassed in argon atmosphere (evacuation to 20 mbar followed by periodical filling with argon). Then, the reaction mixture was heated in vacuum to 120 °C, held for 1 h and stirred with periodical filling with Ar. A homogeneous colorless solution was obtained, and the reaction atmosphere was filled with argon and heated to 220 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The yellow color appeared at around 200 °C. In 9 minutes the mixture was cooled down to r.t. and 10 mL of toluene was added. The purification was carried out according to the procedure described above for the comparative syntheses of CdSe nanoparticles using precursors 1–6.
Results and discussion
Among the limited number of stable organoselenium compounds, the potential candidates for Se-precursors in NP synthesis in this work were selected based on the following considerations. First of all, we considered only individual phosphorus-free selenium containing compounds. Second, these compounds should be non-volatile with a high enough boiling/decomposition temperature to be applied in the thermolysis method for NP fabrication. Finally, the last but not the least, they should possess high enough solubility in non-polar organic solvents, typically used in the synthesis of quantum dots.
Recently, it was shown that alkyloligoselenides can be reactive components of the complex Se–ODE mixture.32 Thus, initially, we chose individual dioctylselenide 1 and dioctyldiselenide 2 as Se sources in our study (Fig. 1a). These compounds are readily obtained in one step from 1-bromooctane by reaction with the generated Se2− and Se22− anions, correspondingly, similar to ref. 33. Commercially available selenomethionine 3, being a representative of dialkylselenides, was also examined as a potential Se-precursor in this work. Derivatives of selenophene were also considered as promising sources of Se, since they are one of a limited number of examples of sufficiently stable Se-organic compounds and can have good solubility in non-polar solvents. Aminoselenophene 4 can be synthesized in one laboratory step by a one-pot Knoevenagel–Gewald reaction sequence from cyclohexanone, malononitrile and elemental Se.34,35 The acylation of Gewald adduct 4 with acetylchloride or octanoylchloride gives the carbamoyl derivatives 5, 6. The detailed description of the synthesis of Se-precursors is provided in the ESI.†

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of compounds 1–6 revealed that all of them, except compound 6, decompose within the temperature range of 200–300 °C (Fig. 1b), perfectly matching the temperatures typically used in the thermolysis method of NP synthesis. This decomposition occurs prior to the boiling of the corresponding compounds, which we checked separately by heating in an N2 atmosphere. The residual mass after the decomposition of compounds 1–6 was in the range of 5–20% of the initial mass indicating that different routes of decomposition/polymerization for these compounds result in different amounts of non-volatile carbonized residue. All the new compounds showed good solubility in ODE, and initially, we checked their capabilities in the synthesis of QDs in this commonly used solvent. As we targeted on the elaboration of the synthetic approach suitable for industrial production, we chose the non-injection phosphorus-free method and the isolation/purification steps were performed in open air. In each case, we calculated the total yield of NPs relative to the amount of the initial Se-precursor, which was used in a molar ratio 2:3 to the Cd-source. Cadmium stearate and oleylamine (OAm) were chosen as the common Cd-precursor and coordinative ligand, respectively, in the standard synthesis protocol.19 Since the reaction kinetic was different for different precursors at a fixed temperature (200 °C), we varied the reaction time in the range of 3–30 minutes for different Se-precursors. Normally, the reaction was terminated when a clearly pronounced first excitonic peak of CdSe NPs was observed in the range of λmax ≥ 530 nm in the absorption spectrum of the reaction mixture, as an indicator of the formation of regular size NPs (see example in Fig. 3a). In a typical synthesis, a degassed mixture of Se-precursor, cadmium stearate and OAm in ODE was heated to 200 °C with a fixed speed of 50 °C min−1, and this temperature was maintained while monitoring the UV-vis absorption of the reaction mixture. This temperature was chosen based on the first pilot experiments, which revealed that in the given reaction conditions nucleation starts at around 190 °C, almost irrespective of the Se-precursor used. The results of the testing of compounds 1–6 in these conditions are summarized in Table 1.

It is seen from Table 1 that all the studied precursors, except dialkylselenide representatives 1 and 3, are capable of forming luminescent CdSe NPs. In case of 1 and 3 no QDs were formed in these conditions according to spectral analysis and TEM data.
All the obtained CdSe QDs possessed luminescent properties (see Table 1, and Fig. 3a for typical PL spectra), but the best result, in terms of reaction yield and optical properties, was obtained using aminoselenophene 4 precursor. The measured QY, after the isolation of QDs from the reaction mixture, was 14%, which is a good value for “nake” CdSe NPs without additional shell and air-contact precautions during purification. The yield of QDs was 82%, which is much higher than that for all the other studied precursors, although NPs of the smallest size were formed with this precursor (3.0 nm, Table 1 and Fig. 2b).

Acylated aminoselenophene 5, in the same conditions, gave weakly luminescent NPs of 3.4 nm size in much lower yield (17%, Table 1, Fig. 2c), although the evolution of the absorption and emission spectra during the synthesis was much faster than in the case of aminoselenophene 4. Moreover, in the case of octanoyl derivative 6, the yield of NPs further decreased (6%, Table 1). Increasing the reaction time resulted in the formation of non-uniform and non-luminescent multipods (see Fig. 2d).
The highest yield of CdSe QDs in the case of aminoselenophene 4 and the general trend of yield decreasing in the series 4–6 can be explained as follows. As we have found, the nucleation starts near to 190 °C, irrespective of the Se-precursor type. However, the higher thermal stability of compounds 5 and 6 in comparison to that of 4 (see TGA data in Fig. 1) results in a lower active Se species concentration when the nucleation temperature of 190 °C is reached and, thereby, a lower CdSe monomer concentration. According to the La Mer nucleation model,38,39 the number of generated seeds per unit of time depends strongly on the degree of supersaturation (DS); therefore, in the case of 4 one can expect a much higher number of generated seeds at 190 °C than that for 5 and 6. Accordingly, with a higher number of nuclei in the case of 4, the final NP size is smaller39–41 and the reaction yield is higher. Obviously, the conversion of 5 and 6 to CdSe NPs and, hence, the reaction yield can be increased by increasing the reaction time; however, because of the low number of nuclei in this case, only large non-uniform and non-luminescent multipods are formed (see, e.g., Fig. 2d). It is also clear that due to the strong dependence of both the nucleation rate and compound stability on the temperature, the obvious way to increase the nucleation rate and, thereby, QD yield, in the case of 5 and 6, is by increasing the reaction temperature. However, using the non-injection procedure, which is one of the aims of this work, it is challenging to achieve a high temperature avoiding nucleation start at around 190 °C. Thus, matching of the nucleation start point and thermal stability of aminoselenophene 4, in these reaction conditions, is responsible for the highest QD yield in this case.
Two general routes for Se to CdSe conversion can be proposed, either through the formation of intermediate Se(0)42,43 or by the direct acid/base reaction of R–Se–R species with Cd2+ complex.19 Although the sign of formation of hexagonal Se(0) can be observed in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the CdSe product (e.g. peak around 2θ = 30°, see Fig. SI-1a†), it does not necessarily mean that this Se(0) is the only key intermediate, as it can also be formed in a side process of Se-precursor decomposition. Conversely, the fact that the nucleation temperature (≈190 °C in this reaction condition) is lower than the starting decomposition point of our Se-precursors (see Fig. 1) suggests that a direct reaction of Cd salt with Se-precursor can occur, e.g. through the formation of intermediate selenide containing complexes, similar to ref. 44 and 45. Thus, a further study of the possible intermediates (if stable) and reaction kinetics depending on the molecular structure of the precursors can disclose the reaction mechanism in more detail.
Selected Se-precursors are additionally studied in different reaction conditions including variation of ligands and temperature. In particular, the replacement of OAm with oleic acid (OA) and varying of the reaction temperature, in case of selenomethionine 3, still do not result in NP formation according to spectral data. Conversely, the replacement of OAm with OA in case of dioctylselenide 1, results in the formation of elongated nanopods with arm lengths of about 60–70 nm (Fig. 2e). To summarize, the use of OA as a ligand, instead of OAm with our Se-precursors, results in an increase in the nucleation temperature to up to around 260 °C and faster process kinetics. Obviously, in accordance with previous studies,40,46 OA strongly reduces the nucleation rate providing less amount of nuclei, which results in fast growth of NPs. As sphalerite crystal structure is common when no strongly coordinative ligands are used and reaction temperature is relatively low (<300 °C), faster reaction kinetics should result in a highly symmetrical tetrapod-like morphology47 rather than 1D (rod-like) growth as in the case of wurtzite CdSe seeds. In accordance with this, we observed the formation of CdSe nanotetrapods using OA as a ligand, where longer tetrapods formed at 265 °C and shorter ones could be obtained at higher temperature (e.g. 300 °C, cf.Fig. 2f and g). In the presence of OAm ligand, in some cases, we also obtained branched structures under longer reaction time (see Fig. 2d). However, the acceleration of the reaction rate by using OA allowed us to convert the initial [Cd] and [Se] monomers into the tetrapod-shaped NPs more efficiently. It is worth noting that CdSe tetrapods/multipods are very promising materials for application in hybrid photovoltaic devices such as low-cost solar cells achieving an EQE of up to 50%.48
To assess the scope of selenophene derivatives in the synthesis of other elongated nanostructures, such as nanorods (NRs), we examined the method described in ref. 49 for the synthesis of wurtzite CdSe NPs. Thus Cd–HDPA complex was generated by the reaction of CdO with hexadecylphosphonic acid (HDPA) in TOPO followed by the injection of a solution of 5 in TOPO/ODE mixture at 320 °C for the nucleation of CdSe seeds. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled to 250 °C and multiple injections of the solution of 5 were performed for controlled growth. As a result, NRs (Fig. 2k) with multipod admixture (Fig. 2i) were obtained. TEM analysis of the reaction probe just after the nucleation step (first hot injection at 320 °C) revealed the presence of NPs of large size (10–15 nm, Fig. 2i), which can be a reason for the subsequent formation of non-uniform elongated NPs. Thus, further optimization of nucleation conditions should result in the formation of more uniform CdSe NRs.
Luminescent quantum rods are highly demanded materials in many applications, and particularly important for displays.50–52 We examined the possibility to synthesize CdSe/CdS nanorods based on a common reaction protocol31 using dioctyldiselenide 2 as Se-precursor instead of TOP-Se in the step of CdSe seed formation. As a result, luminescent (Fig. 3c) CdSe NPs (λem = 588 nm, FWHM = 28 nm) were isolated. The further growth of rod-like CdS shell according to a general method31 on the as-synthesized CdSe seeds proceeded smoothly furnishing the luminescent CdSe/CdS NRs (Fig. 3c) of about 60 nm in length (Fig. 2l). The emission λmax of the obtained QRs was 636 nm and FWHM = 26 nm with 53% QY. This result clearly highlights the high potential of dialkyldiselenides in the synthesis of quantum rods, in addition to quantum dots reported earlier30 and in this work. The specific advantages of dialkyldiselenides are higher stability upon storage and being in liquid form at room temperature. The latter property can further allow the use of 2 without any additional dilution, thereby, improving the synthesis mass efficiency and decreasing the temperature variation associated with the injection of a large amount of Se-precursor solution,31 which is of high importance in large-scale production.

To demonstrate the scope of our method in the synthesis of heterostructured QDs, one-pot treatment with S-ODE was performed for the obtained CdSe NPs. Using selenophene 5, we fabricated a series of QDs with QYs up to 38% and PL wavelength from green (λem = 515 nm) to red (λem = 625 nm), depending on the reaction time (see Fig. 3b). In addition, using the initial reaction mixture of aminoselenophene 4 with thiophene 7, it was also possible to obtain hybrid CdSe@CdS QDs by the non-injection method (Fig. 2h).
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for selected CdSe QDs are presented in Fig. SI-1a in ESI.† The diffraction pattern of CdSe, synthesized using precursor 2 in standard conditions with OAm, shows the presence of sphalerite (zinc blende) CdSe crystal structure (Fig. SI-1a†). The strong peak near to 2θ = 30° can be assigned to Se(0) hexagonal phase, which can be a product of Se-precursor decomposition. The XRD patterns for CdSe QDs synthesized using the same precursor 2 with HDPA ligand at 360 °C (the seeds for CdSe/CdS quantum rods synthesis) are shown in Fig. SI-1b.† This pattern, compared to sphalerite CdSe, is characterized by the absence of the peak near to 2θ = 61°, which is explained by the wurtzite CdSe crystal structure in this case. Indeed, in accordance with literature data,31,47 alkylphosphonic acid ligands and higher temperature are favourable for the formation of wurtzite CdSe QDs. The representative HRTEM images of the corresponding samples are shown in Fig. SI-2 (see ESI†).
Conclusions
In conclusion, our study of new Se-precursors reveals the high efficiency of selenophene derivatives in the phosphorus-free non-injection synthesis of QDs and nanotetrapods as well as the high potential of dialkyldiselenides in the synthesis of quantum rods. The luminescence of the as-obtained CdSe and hybrid CdSe/CdS QDs covers the practically important spectral range, from 515 to 625 nm, and the elaborate procedure for the synthesis of QDs is reproducible, straightforward and cheap. These Se-precursors are readily available air-stable compounds, retaining all the properties upon storage for at least 18 months. The use of aminoderivative 4, due to the perfect matching between its thermal stability and the nucleation temperature of CdSe NPs, results in high reaction yield (82%) of luminescent CdSe QDs. In addition, as the optimized process does not require any injection, these new Se-sources have potential for application in QD manufacturing industry, thereby replacing the highly toxic Se-trialkylphosphine and the unstable with time Se–ODE solutions. Moreover, dioctyldiselenide shows perfect results in the synthesis of CdSe/CdS core–shell nanorods and, therefore, can be considered as an alternative to TOP-Se precursor in the production of quantum rods.
