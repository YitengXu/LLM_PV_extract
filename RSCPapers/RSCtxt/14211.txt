    , Accepted 28th May 2019First published on 30th May 2019AbstractElectrocatalytic water-splitting is considered as a highly promising technology for the sustainable production of hydrogen. Currently, the commercial distribution of such devices is limited by the high price of noble metal (e.g. Pt) electrocatalysts, which still show the best activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here it is shown that nickel phosphide (Ni-P) decorated with trace amounts of Pt fulfils both performance and cost requirements for HER electrocatalysis. The catalyst was prepared via a facile and safe two-step wet chemical process. Its excellent performance relies on the synergistic effect between Ni-P and Pt, which leads to a stronger reductive power of Pt and better hydrogen adsorption and reaction kinetics. These findings demonstrate the possibilities to advance the field of water electrolysis and other fields of catalysis by utilizing low-cost catalysts with noble metal-like activity.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen production by water electrolysis is promising as a clean and sustainable method for energy production.1–3 Current electrocatalysts are mainly based on noble metals such as Pt. Indeed, despite great progress in this field and the introduction of many new electrocatalysts, such as metal phosphides, sulfides and nitrides, Pt still exhibits the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalytic activity, especially in acid.4 However, although extra voltage is needed to trigger the reaction process, performing HER in alkaline solution is highly desirable because of a weakened corrosion process of both the electrocatalysts and the electrolyzers. Moreover, as most of the photoelectrocatalytic water-splitting technologies operate in alkaline solutions, the improvement of the electrocatalyst side may lead to better total solar-to-fuel conversion.5
However, it has proved challenging to develop efficient HER electrocatalysts for alkaline medium that can act with similar efficiency and stability to those of Pt in acid; even Pt, which exhibits excellent HER activities in acid, shows inadequate performances under alkaline conditions,5 with HER kinetics usually several orders of magnitude lower than in acidic environments. The low activity in alkaline media is mostly due to the complicated reaction pathway involving an additional water dissociation process,6 as well as the poisoning of active sites by the OH− ions.6,7
Over the past few years, transition-metal phosphides, especially nickel phosphides (Ni-P), have been investigated as advanced HER electrocatalysts thanks to their unique electronic structure, low price and good corrosion resistance.8–10 In most cases, unlike powder-based electrocatalysts, Ni-P electrocatalysts prepared by the direct modification of Ni foam (NF) exhibit promisingly better activity owing to their high electrochemical surface area, better conductivity and a lack of binders.11–17 Though many efforts have been concentrated on modifying Ni-P/NF catalysts by structural design or by doping with non-precious transition-metals, such as Fe,18–21 Co,22–24 Mn25,26 and Mo,12,27,28 they still show low HER performance compared to Pt electrocatalysts (Pt wire, Pt plate, and Pt/C, Table S1†). However, the scarcity and high cost of Pt impede its utilisation in commercial electrolyzers.29–31 Therefore, we envision that for alkaline water electrocatalysis to really achieve commercial success, a catalyst with a similar activity to that of Pt in acid is required, together with a low price, close to the price of non-noble metal electrocatalysts.
Recently, it was shown that the combination of Pt with other metals can improve its performance, owing to better water dissociation and catalytic activity.32–35 In addition, recent studies show that phosphorus can strongly interact with Pt ions by its free pair of electrons.36 Therefore, we envision that P–Pt and Ni–Pt interactions will tune the electronic and catalytic properties of Pt for HER. Here, we report the synthesis of a nickel phosphide electrocatalyst which contains only a trace amount of Pt (<0.5 wt%) and shows excellent performances for HER in both acidic and alkaline solutions. A nickel foam was first submitted to a solvothermal phosphorisation process, followed by Pt deposition, to afford a ternary Ni-P–Pt/NF electrocatalyst. This catalyst exhibits excellent activity and stability toward HER in both acidic and alkaline media. In 1 M KOH aqueous solution, an overpotential of only 34 mV is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of ∼31 mV dec−1. These values are better compared to those of the state-of-the-art noble metal based electrocatalysts and represent a step forward toward integration of low-price electrocatalysts for commercial applications. Detailed experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the high activity of Ni-P–Pt/NF is due to the high electron density on the Pt surface, better hydrogen adsorption and the large electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), which lead to better HER activity.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and reagents
All the solvents, reagents and materials were used as received without further purification unless stated otherwise. Deionized (DI) water was purified using a Millipore Direct-Q system (18.2 MΩ cm resistivity). Methanol (MeOH, AR-b grade) and ethanol (EtOH, CP-b grade) were purchased from Bio-Lab Ltd. Ethylene glycol (EG) was purchased from Fisher BioReagents. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, AR/ACS, 99.8%) and potassium hydroxide pellets (KOH, AR., 85%) were purchased from Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd. Red phosphorus (≥97.0%), ethanolamine (ETA, 98%) and chloroplatinic acid solution (H2PtCl6, 8 wt% in H2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 96%) was bought from CARLO ERBA Reagents. Nickel foam (1.6 mm T × 300 mm W, surface density: 350 g m−2) was supplied by MTI cooperation.
2.2. Pretreatment of red phosphorus
Red phosphorus was pretreated through a hydrothermal process to give a better dispersion in the solvent, which has a porous structure characterized by TEM analysis (Fig. S1†). Briefly, 5 g of red phosphorus was first dispersed in 60 mL of deionized (DI) water under ultrasound irradiation for 1 h, and then was transferred into a 100 mL sealed Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 12 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the pretreated phosphorus residue was filtered, washed several times with DI water and finally dried under vacuum for further use.
2.3. Synthesis of Ni-P/NF catalysts
Ni foam was cut in rectangles of 2 cm × 3 cm, then washed with DI water and EtOH alternately several times to remove the impurities on the surface, and finally dried in a vacuum for further use. The Ni-P/NF catalyst was synthesized via an easy and straightforward phosphorisation procedure of Ni foam with red phosphorus in the liquid phase. Typically, 0.1 g of pretreated red phosphorus was dispersed in 60 mL of ETA under continuous sonication to give a uniform mixture. Subsequently, a piece of Ni foam was immersed into the suspension and sonicated for another 30 min. The mixture was then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and stored at 180 °C for 10 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the resulting Ni-P/NF was washed with DI water and EtOH repeatedly with sonication to carefully remove the adsorbed red phosphorus, and it was finally dried in a vacuum at 60 °C. For comparison, different solvents such as MeOH, EG, EtOH and DMF were also chosen as the media for the sample synthesis.
2.4. Synthesis of Ni-P–Pt/NF catalysts
The whole synthetic process of Ni-P–Pt/NF catalysts is illustrated in Fig. S1.† Following the Ni-P/NF synthesis, Ni-P–Pt/NF catalysts with various Pt contents were fabricated by a simple chemical replacement approach. Typically, to a 45 mL reaction vessel, 20 mL of newly prepared H2PtCl6 (8 wt% in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution (0.1 mM) and a piece of Ni–Pt/NF catalyst (1 cm × 2 cm) were added in sequence. After shaking for 2 h at 400 rpm, the obtained catalyst was taken out, rinsed with DI water and dried at 60 °C, labelled as Ni-P–Pt0.1/NF, where the subscript is the initial concentration of H2PtCl6 aqueous solution. For comparison, Ni-P–Ptx/NF (x = 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0) and Ptx/NF (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0) electrodes were prepared in the same way by changing the concentrations of H2PtCl6 aqueous solution (0.1 mM, 0.2 mM, 0.5 mM and 1.0 mM, respectively). The commercial Pt/C/NF catalyst was prepared by dropping Pt/C ink (the ink is composed of 20 mg of 20 wt% Pt/C, 1 mL of isopropanol, 1 mL of H2O and 0.2 mL of Nafion solution) onto NF (0.75 wt% of Pt loading).
2.5. Sample characterization
The morphology of the catalysts was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7400F, equipped with a FEG source, operated at 3.5 kV) and analytical high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM 2100F, equipped with a FEG source, operated at 200 kV). Energy-Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy analysis was performed using a JSM-7400F SEM equipped with a Thermo Scientific NORAN System SIX operating at 25 kV or a JEOL JEM-2100F TEM operating at 200 kV equipped with a JED-2300T energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer. Scanning TEM (STEM) images were taken using an annular dark-field JEOL detector (EM 24560) and GATAN 806 HAADF STEM detector. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) spectra of the catalysts were recorded on a Panalytical Empyrean Powder Diffractometer equipped with a position sensitive detector X'Celerator. Data were collected with a scanning time of ∼15 min for 2θ ranging from 10° to 80° under Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å, 40 kV, 30 mA). The chemical states of the elements were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250, Kα, 1486.6 eV). The actual Pt contents in Ni-P–Pt/NF catalysts were measured through inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Shimadzu ICPS-7510).
2.6. Electrochemical measurements
All the electrochemical measurements were performed in a typical three electrode cell using the NF supported catalysts as the working electrode, Pt plate as the counter electrode (unless stated otherwise) and Ag/AgCl (sat) as the reference electrode on a Metrohm Autolab potentiostat. Throughout all the electrochemical measurements, the potentials calibrated after iR correction were converted to the values with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) following the Nernst equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 V + 0.0591 × pH. Here, 1 M KOH aqueous solution and 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution were chosen as typical alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Here, all the LSV polarization curves for HER are iR-corrected following the equation below unless otherwise indicated: Ecorrected = Emeasured − iRs(1)where Ecorrected is the iR-corrected potential, and Emeasured and i are the potential and current measured directly via a Metrohm Autolab potentiostat, respectively. And Rs is the equivalent series resistance obtained through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The double-layer capacitance behavior of the catalysts was probed in 1 M KOH aqueous solution by cyclic voltammetry between −0.1 V and 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl at different scan rates, which can be used to estimate the ECSAs. In order to exclude the influence of dissolved Pt from the Pt plate within a long time, a graphite rod was employed as the counter electrode for the durability measurement. The long-term durability of the catalysts was assessed by chronopotentiometry at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. Spin-polarized DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP). Detailed information can be found in ESI† “DFT computational details”.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization of the trace Pt-decorated Ni-P–Pt/NF catalyst
The synthetic procedure for Ni-P–Pt/NF is illustrated in Fig. S2.† The Ni-P was synthesized by direct solvothermal phosphorisation of Ni foam (NF) in different solvents. We found out that using ethanolamine (ETA) as the solvent reproducibly afforded the most catalytically active Ni-P. Further discussion about the role of the solvent used in the solvothermal process in the Ni-P properties is given in the ESI (Fig. S3 and S4†). SEM images (Fig. S3a–c†) show that the Ni-P synthesized in ETA exhibits a needle-like morphology. The EDX spectroscopy elemental maps and spectrum of Ni-P/NF confirm the homogeneous dispersion of Ni and P species (Fig. S3d†). Here, it should be noted that the Ni-P is composed of two phases, Ni12P5 and Ni2P, where Ni2P is mostly located at the edge of the sample. More detailed information can be found in Fig. S3e and f.† Subsequently, Pt was deposited by immersing the Ni-P/NF into H2Pt6Cl2 solutions with various concentrations. The Pt deposition leads to a ternary Ni-P–Ptx/NF catalyst (x stands for the initial concentration (mM) of H2PtCl6 aqueous solution; detailed information is given in the Methods section). The Pt deposition leads to a slight change of morphology from needles to a grass-like architecture (Fig. 1a–d). ICP measurements reveal very low Pt content in all samples and a direct correlation between the Pt concentration in the starting solution and that in the final material (Table S2†). We note that most of the characterization techniques from this stage were performed for Ni-P–Pt0.5/NF as it showed the best overall electrocatalytic performance while its price remains low. Here, it should be mentioned that the Ni-P–Pt0.5/NF catalyst was ground to give a Ni-P–Pt0.5 powder without a magnetic Ni framework for both TEM and HRTEM characterization methods. HRTEM images and related selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) of the Ni-P–Pt0.5/NF catalyst (Fig. 1e and f) indicate that the Ni-P surface is covered with small Pt particles. They show a narrow size distribution ranging from 2 to 4.5 nm with an average particle size of 3.3 nm (Fig. S3g and h†). Interplanar spacings of 0.196 and ∼0.225 nm, which correspond to the (200) and (111) lattice planes of fcc-Pt, respectively, were observed. A line-scan measurement shows that (Fig. 1g) Pt atoms are mainly located on the surface of the Ni-P phase. The energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX) mapping images reveal a uniform dispersion of Ni, P and Pt species (Fig. 1h). Additionally, small particles can be seen on the surface of Pt0.5/NF (Fig. S5†).

The XRD patterns of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 1i. For the Ni-foam, three intense peaks, centered at 44.5, 51.8 and 76.4°, attributed to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of face-centered-cubic (fcc) Ni were observed.37 The XRD pattern of the Ni-P materials revealed the presence of tetragonal Ni12P5 (ref. 38 and 39) and hexagonal Ni2P8,18 phases. It is important to note that only in ETA does the solvothermal treatment lead to a clear Ni-P formation (Fig. S6 and S7†). After Pt anchoring, no characteristic diffraction peaks of Pt were detected, owing to the low Pt content (Table S2†) and to the peak broadening caused by the small size of the Pt particles (Fig. 1e). From the intensity of XRD patterns of Ni12P5 and Ni2P, it can be seen that the peak intensity ratio of Ni2P/Ni12P5 decreases after Pt deposition, suggesting that Pt directly comes into contact with the Ni2P species. Moreover, during catalyst preparation, the outer side of the surface is P-rich compared with the inner part due to the diffusion limitation of P into the Ni foam during the reaction. The latter together with HRTEM data (Fig. S3e and f†) lead to the conclusion that the catalyst surface is mainly composed of Ni2P.
XPS spectra of all elements are given in Fig. 2 and S8.† For the pristine Ni foam, the Ni 2p peaks (Fig. 2a) can be assigned to the Ni2+ species in NiO (binding energy (BE) = 855.4 and 873.0 eV) and to Ni2+ species in Ni(OH)2 (BE = 861.0 and 879.0 eV).19,40 No peaks of Ni0 were detected probably due to the facile oxidation of metallic Ni in air.41 The introduction of H2PtCl6 leads to a surface modification and some metallic Ni was obtained in Pt0.5/NF, owing to the slightly acidic nature of H2PtCl6 and the Ni–Pt interaction. For the phosphide-based catalysts, two new peaks were detected at 852.8 and 870 eV, which belong to the Ni species in Ni-P phases.19,42 To understand the interaction of Pt with the materials, we measured the XPS spectra of Pt 4f for Pt0.5/NF, Ni-P–Pt0.5/NF and commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) (Fig. 2b). The Pt 4f peak of commercial Pt/C can be deconvoluted into two pairs of doublets, corresponding to Pt0 (BE = 72.0 and 75.3 eV) and Pt2+ (BE = 73.4 and 76.7 eV),43 while for Pt0.5/NF, two more peaks at higher binding energies of 74.7 and 78.0 eV were detected, indicating an oxidation state of +4, which is probably due to the oxidation of Ni foam as well as the oxidation of Pt in air.44,45 Interestingly, the Pt binding energies for Ni-P–Pt0.5/NF are shifted to lower energies, suggesting a strong interaction between Pt and Ni-P. In addition, the Pt0/Pt2+ ratio for Ni-P–Pt0.5 is higher than that of Pt/C and Pt0.5/NF. The shift toward low binding energies and the increased Pt0 population percentage imply that there is electron transfer from Ni-P to Pt, resulting in a higher electron density on Pt, which is beneficial to HER.46,47 The peaks situated at 68.0 eV in both Pt 4f spectra of Pt0.5/NF and Ni-P–Pt0.5/NF are assigned to Ni(II) 3p.48 As for the P high-resolution XPS spectra, the fitted P 2p peaks centered at BE = 129.6 and 130.3 eV are assigned to the metal–phosphorus bonds, while the broad feature at around BE = 133.0 eV corresponds to the P–O bonds of phosphate resulting from air oxidation.22 Compared with Ni-P/NF, P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2 fitted peaks for Ni-P–Pt0.5/NF show a positive shift of approximately 0.1 eV, indicating an interaction between P and Pt as well.19

3.2. Electrocatalytic performance
The HER performances of all materials were evaluated using a three-electrode configuration with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, Pt plate (1 cm × 1 cm) as the counter electrode and 1 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. As mentioned before, we chose the Ni-P/NF catalyst prepared in ETA because of its superior electrochemical performance (Fig. S9–S11†). The pristine Ni foam exhibits a high overpotential (269 mV) at 10 mA cm−2 compared to Ni-P/NF (176 mV) and the Pt plate (119 mV). The Pt plate and Ni foam have a Tafel slope close to 120 mV dec−1, indicating that the Volmer process is the rate-limiting step (Fig. S9†), while a Tafel slope of 86 mV dec−1 (Fig. S9a and c†) was recorded for Ni-P/NF, suggesting a Volmer–Heyrovsky reaction mechanism.1
To evaluate the effect of the deposition of Pt on the surface of Ni-P/NF on the HER performance, various quantities of Pt were deposited using solutions with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mM. The HER performance of Ni-P/NF increases upon deposition of Pt on its surface, even at trace amounts (Fig. 3a). The introduction of Pt also dramatically reduced the required overpotential for all samples at 10 mA cm−2. The overpotential decreases at higher Pt content, ranging from 68 mV to 24 mV for the samples we studied (selected LSV curves without iR correction are given in Fig. S12†). In addition, the HER kinetics change according to the Pt amount. For 0.1 mM H2PtCl6 solution, the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism is still observed according to the Tafel slopes, while the HER mechanism changes at higher Pt concentration to Tafel and then Volmer–Tafel mechanisms (∼30 mV dec−1, Fig. 3b). It is noted that the obtained overpotentials and the fast reaction kinetics in this work are amid the best reported for (non)noble metal-based HER electrocatalysts under alkaline conditions (Table S3†). The price of the catalyst mainly depends on the amount of Pt as the price of nickel is negligible in comparison. As a result, the cost of the catalyst is kept low by using very low amounts of Pt and thus the cost for hydrogen production can be significantly reduced (Table S4†). In addition to the Pt plate, we also measured the activity of the commercial Pt/C/NF catalyst toward HER. It shows a similar overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 to that of Ni-P–Pt0.5/NF, but a much larger Tafel slope.

The inset is the corresponding durability test for HER at 10 mA cm−2; for the durability test, a graphitic rod as the counter electrode was used; (e) LSV curves of Ni-P–Pt/NF catalysts for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution (iR corrected); (f) corresponding Tafel plots of HER catalyzed by Ni-P–Pt/NF in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. 
For comparison, the alkaline HER performance of Pt/NF electrocatalysts was also evaluated (Fig. S9b and d†) and the needed overpotentials to support a current of 10 mA cm−2 also decreased at higher Pt content. However, the Pt/NF electrocatalysts exhibit much lower activity compared to Ni-P–Pt/NF. Double-layer capacitance measurements reveal that the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of Ni-P–Pt/NF increases at higher Pt content (Fig. 3c and S11c†). The higher ECSA can lead to higher HER activity thanks to more active sites for the reaction. The same trend stands also for the Pt/NF electrodes, where the ECSA increases with Pt addition (Fig. S10 and S11†). The normalized current densities with ECSAs (Fig. S13†) indicate that besides ECSA, other reasons, such as the interaction between Ni-P and Pt, can be regarded as the factors for the better activity of Pt/NF catalysts. Detailed discussions can be found in XPS analysis and theoretical calculation.
The long-term durability of Ni-P–Pt0.5/NF was measured by chronopotentiometry at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH aqueous solution, using a graphite rod as the counter electrode in order to avoid the influence of dissolved Pt from the Pt plate. A slight decline of the overpotential was observed over time when Ni-P/NF and Pt1.0/NF were used (Fig. S14†). However, after Pt deposition on Ni-P/NF, the overpotential remains stable without any noticeable decrease throughout the course of measurement (Fig. 3d). After 24 h of using Ni-P–Pt0.5/NF at 10 mA cm−2, an overpotential of 34 mV was sufficient to reach the same current density (Fig. 3d). Post-characterization measurements indicate that the morphology of the Ni-P–Pt0.5/NF electrode is essentially preserved (Fig. S15a–c†) and that the crystalline structure remains alike (Fig. S15d†), showing a good chemical stability of Ni-P. According to the XPS results in Fig. S16,† nickel phosphate and platinum phosphate were formed after the durability test, probably from partial oxidation of the phosphide species by dissolved oxygen.
Similar to the reported Ni foam based HER catalysts,8,17 the HER performances of Ni-P–Pt/NF were further studied in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. As expected, the activities of all Pt-containing catalysts, including Pt plate and Pt/C/NF are higher compared to that of Ni-P in acid and very low overpotentials are needed (∼50 mV) to support 10 mA cm−2 current density (Fig. 3e and S17†). The LSV curves before iR correction are given in Fig. S12.† The corresponding Tafel slopes of Ni-P–Pt0.5/NF and Ni-P–Pt1.0/NF are ∼35 mV dec−1 (Fig. 3f), confirming the Volmer–Tafel mechanism usually observed with Pt-based electrocatalysts. At lower Pt amounts, the reaction mechanism changed to a Volmer–Heyrovsky and then to a Heyrovsky mechanism. Unsurprisingly, Pt/NF electrodes also demonstrate high activity with small overpotentials at 10 mA cm−2. However, similar to what was observed under basic conditions, Ni-P–Pt/NF catalysts exhibit a lower overpotential and faster reaction kinetics than Pt/NF (Fig. S16b and d†).
3.3. Theoretical calculations
To understand the trends in the observed enhanced catalytic HER activity and the reasons for the improved performance in the presence of Pt atom(s) on the surface of Ni-P/NF, we performed theoretical calculation to model the Ni2P (001) surface for HER activities.49 Spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP)50,51 with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)52 functional. Further computational details are provided in the ESI.† We modelled the crystal structure of nickel phosphide (Ni2P), which adopts the hexagonal structure of Fe2P, a well-known hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalyst which produces H2(g) via a water–gas shift reaction.53 We initially constructed the bulk Ni2P structure and minimized its energy by using DFT. We then constructed the Ni2P (001) surface by cleaving the two possible terminations as shown in Fig. 4a and b: Cut-1(P-rich): 3Ni + 2P atoms on the surface termination of the unit cell and Cut-2(P-poor): 3Ni + 1P atoms are on the surface of the unit cell but later after hydrogen coverage, the surface structure changes where one P atom of the inner layer is shifted to the surfaces layer and the surface layer changes to a 3Ni + 2P configuration. For P-rich conditions (Cut-1), the first hydrogen is located between the top of three Ni/Pt atoms, whereas the second and third hydrogens are located on top of P surface atoms. On the other hand, for P-poor conditions (Cut-2), the surfaces are less stable (less symmetric) because the P positions and covered Hs are located at random places.
 Fig. 4  (a and b) Atomic cell structures of two different terminations denoted “Cut-1” and “Cut-2” of Ni2P (001) surfaces and the hydrogen covered surface under steady state HER conditions as determined by DFT calculations. All three hydrogen atoms in the cell are circled in red. Ni, P, and Pt atoms are shown in blue, purple and green colors, respectively. Dark and light colors represent the atoms on the surface and inner atoms, respectively; (c) TOF values of the different surface terminations and compositions of Ni2P/Ni2P–Pt (001) in the HER activity volcano as determined by calculated hydrogen adsorption free energies. 
We determined the differential hydrogen adsorption energies ΔEH by taking energy differences between the thermodynamically most favorable H-covered surfaces. Hydrogen coverages on these terminations are determined from phase diagrams (Fig. S18–S25 and Table S5†). Since three Ni surface atoms are positioned on both kinds of surface terminations, we examined HER activities until 1 ML H coverage for the HER volcano plot. Exchange current densities were calculated by Nørskov's kinetic model of the HER54 and results of the volcano plot are summarized in Fig. 4c below. From this volcano plot, we observed that pure Ni2P (001) surfaces are located far from ΔGH = 0 (around ∼0.4 eV) but after replacing Ni atoms with Pt atoms, the position is shifted to the top of the volcano plot. The maximum shift is from ∼0.4 eV (without Pt) to 0.01 eV (P-rich 3Pt) which explains the improved catalytic HER activity upon Pt doping. Detailed information is given in the ESI (Fig. S17–S24 and Table S5†). Compared with Pt (111) reported by Nørskov's group54,55 (Table S5†), where Ni2P is also present and near to ΔGH = 0.4, most of our results (Pt-deposited cases except P-poor-1Pt) show better performance than Pt(111) (ΔGH = 0.11).
In addition to this, we also found that charge transfer from P to Pt atoms upon Pt doping is in agreement with experiments. We have done Bader charge analysis56 to understand the charge state of surface atoms and the results are summarized in the ESI (Tables S6 and S7†). As seen from the two tables, the charges on P are reduced for both surface terminations and are transferred to Pt atoms where the oxidation state of Pt atoms is +2.
Overall, the data show that the good activity of Ni-P–Pt/NF as HER electrocatalysts is due to the combination of several factors: (1) charge transfer from P to Pt atoms (as confirmed by XPS characterization and DFT calculations), which augments the reduction properties of Pt; (2) as catalysis mainly occurs on the surface, the trace amount of Pt, a highly active electrocatalyst, is sufficient; (3) the phosphorus atoms can act as proton and hydride acceptors,42,57 which increases their probability to react on the Pt surface as shown by the fast reaction kinetics; and (4) high ECSA, providing more catalytic sites for HER.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate a straightforward and safe method to deposit small amounts of Pt (<0.5 wt%) on Ni-P/Ni foam, which consists of a simple solvothermal treatment followed by chemical adsorption of Pt. The Ni-P–Pt/NF catalyst exhibits very low overpotential along with high stability and fast reaction kinetics in both alkaline and acidic media for the hydrogen evolution reaction, better performances than those of commercial electrocatalysts based on noble metals. Particularly, Ni-P–Pt0.5/NF requires an overpotential of only 34 mV to support a current density of 10 mA cm−2, with a Tafel slope of 31 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The Ni-P–Pt0.5/NF shows excellent stability and durability with minor decay of the overpotential over 24 hours. Theoretical calculations reveal that the replacement of Ni atoms with Pt positions the Ni-P–Pt close to Pt in the volcano plot due to better hydrogen adsorption and catalytic activity. Thus, together with the experimental data, the excellent performance of the ternary Ni-P–Pt/NF catalyst can be ascribed to the synergistic effect between the Ni-P and Pt, which leads to stronger reduction power of Pt, better reaction kinetics and hydrogen adsorption as well as high electrochemically active surface area. Given the low amount of Pt used, the total price of the catalyst is close to the range of non-noble metals whereas the activity is comparable and even higher than that of noble metal electrocatalysts. We believe that this work provides exciting opportunities to advance the field of alkaline water electrolysis thanks to the high activity and low price of the catalyst. Moreover, we envision that the principles reported here may be beneficial for other fields of catalysis where noble metals still demonstrate better activity.
