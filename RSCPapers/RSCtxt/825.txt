    , Accepted 7th February 2015First published on 12th February 2015AbstractThree dialkylthio benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (S-BDT) based polymers have been developed using different accepting units to tune their bandgaps. The polymer:PC71BM solar cells achieved the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.51% without any post-treatment (such as annealing and solvent additive) in conventional single-cell devices. Joint photophysical, electrical and computational studies on the polymer based solar cells revealed the considerable impact of molecular planarity on polymer design. The polymer:PC71BM devices processed with 1,8-diiodooctane for improving their morphology afforded an improved PCE value of 5.63%, with a Voc of 0.83, a Jsc of 10.24 mA cm−2 and a FF of 66.3%.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention in recent decades and great progress has been made.1–5 The collective efforts of material chemists and device physicists have pushed the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of PSCs over 6%,6–8 with a champion record of 10.6% reported for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structured cells.9 The PCE of solar cells is proportional to the values of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). The bandgap, molecular energy level and mobility are three key considerations in developing polymer donors.
Low bandgap (LBG) polymers adopting a donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating structure form the mainstream of materials development in the pursuit of high-efficiency PSCs. Featuring planar conjugation,10 good regioregularity and easy modification, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been explored as the most popular D unit for LBG polymers.11–13 For the consideration of solubility, intermolecular packing and device performance, BDT core must be functionalized with substituents such as alkyl, alkoxy, thioalkoxy, alkenyl, or alkylthienyl.12,14 In comparison to dialkoxy-BDT (O-BDT), dialkylthio-BDT (S-BDT) was found to lower the HOMO energy level of the resultant polymers, leading to enhanced Voc for the PSCs.15 A similar impact on device performance was demonstrated with 2-D conjugated BDT polymers that were designed by replacing the alkylthienyl substituents with thioalkoxythienyl ones, indicating the advantage of thio-containing BDTs in constructing organic semiconductor materials.15,16
The development of S-BDT polymers, however, was hindered by its difficult synthesis, which involves a two-step protocol with a Newman–Kwart rearrangement under 245 °C as the key step in the literature.17 In conjunction with our research efforts to develop high-efficiency PSCs, we have recently developed the methodology for the direct access to 4,8-functionalized BDTs with deep low-lying HOMO levels and high mobilities.18 The O-BDT based D–A polymers have demonstrated PCE values up to 7.73%. And most of them possessed a HOMO level in the range of −4.90 to −5.22 eV, leading to relatively low Voc (0.56–0.76 V).13 The S-BDT homopolymer was reported to present a PCE value of 4% with Jsc of 7.66 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.53.14 Considering the advantage of S-BDT over O-BDT in lowering the HOMO energy level, it is intriguing to us whether we can develop S-BDT based low bandgap polymers to achieve higher Voc and, thus, high-performance PSCs.
The structure design of LBG polymers should take full consideration of at least three criteria, i.e., effectively stabilized HOMO and LUMO energy levels, planar polymer backbone for cofacial π–π stacking in the solid state, and high hole mobility and solubility.11 Under this guideline, a new D–A polymer by alternating S-BDT with dithienylbenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole (DTBO) was thus designed. The structure features (a) flanking thiophenes on a BO unit to promote the planarity of the polymer backbone, (b) alkylthio substituents to increase the hole mobility and lower the HOMO energy level, and (c) additional alkyl chains to provide a high molecular weight yet good solubility. The manipulation of the polymer backbone's planarity via multiple noncovalent intra- and inter-chain attractive interactions (ca. hydrogen bonding and dipole–dipole interactions) was elegantly demonstrated for the alternating polymers of alkoxylphenylene and fluorinated benzothiadiazole.11 With tight inter-chain packing and balanced hole/electron mobility, the polymer devices with ∼300 nm thick active layer delivered efficiencies up to 9.39% when made with processing additives and methanol treatment.11b
In order to take advantage of the feasible synthesis of S-BDT, we herein developed three LBG polymers by alternating S-BDT with DTBO, dithienylthiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline (DTBTQx) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD). The impact of the electron-accepting strength of the A units on the absorption and energy levels of the resultant polymers was investigated with both experimental results and computational calculations. The photovoltaic properties of the polymers were characterized. The screening of the processing solvents and fullerene acceptors was conducted to optimize the PSC devices. Additionally, the film morphology was studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The best devices with PBDT-DTBO:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) fabricated using a chloroform solution with 1% DIO (3,8-diiodooctane) exhibited a PCE value of 5.63% with Voc of 0.83, Jsc of 10.24 mA cm−2 and FF of 66.3%.
Experimental section
1. Characterization
The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were collected on a Bruker AVANCE 500 MHz (Bio-Spin Corporation, Europe) spectrometer with tetramethyl silane as the internal standard. UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra were measured with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 spectrometer. The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were performed on a Waters 717–2410 with polystyrenes as the reference standard and THF as the eluent. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a TA instrument TGA/SDTA851e at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under nitrogen. The CV measurements were conducted on a CHI660D electrochemistry workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai) with a polymer film on a Pt plate as the working electrode, a Pt slice as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode in a nitrogen-saturated tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) acetonitrile solution. The polymers were coated on a Pt plate from their dilute CF solutions. The AFM images were observed on a Dimension Icon AFM in the tapping mode. TEM analyses were taken with a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope.
2. Synthesis

4,8-Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (2)29. 
Compound 1 (1 g, 4.5 mmol) and dry pyridine (1.5 mL) were dissolved in dichloromethane (60 mL) under a N2 atmosphere and cooled to −10 °C. Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (3.1 mL, 18 mmol) was then added dropwise to the solution. The reaction was stirred for 12 h at room temperature. Hydrochloric acid (20 mL, 1 M) and water were added, and the aqueous phase was extracted with CH2Cl2. The combined organic extracts were washed with brine and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified using column chromatography on silica gel with ethyl acetate:petroleum ether (1:19, v/v) as the eluent to yield compound 2 as a white solid (1.6 g, 73%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ): 8.22 (d, J = 5.6 Hz, 2H), 7.58 (d, J = 5.6 Hz, 2H), 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 135.70, 132.95, 132.53, 130.41, 122.39, 119.84, 119.52, 117.29, 114.74 (JC–F = 319 Hz, CF3); HRMS (EI): m/z = 485.8799 [M]+, calcd for C12H4O6S4F6: 485.8795.


4,8-Di(dodecylthio)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (S-BDT). 
A mixture of 2 (1 g, 2.06 mmol), i-Pr2Net (1.02 mL, 6.15 mmol) and dry toluene (40 mL) was added into a Schlenk tube, which was evacuated and filled with nitrogen (three cycles). Pd2(dba)3 (94 mg, 0.103 mmol), xantphos (120 mg, 0.206 mmol) and 1-dodecanethiol (1.47 mL, 6.18 mmol) were added. After another two cycles of degassing and nitrogen re-filling, the reaction mixture was heated to reflux overnight. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel and recrystallized in ethanol to afford a yellow solid (1.2 g, 98%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.75 (d, J = 5.6 Hz, 2H), 7.54 (d, J = 5.6 Hz, 2H), 2.99 (t, J = 7.3 Hz, 4H), 1.57–1.51 (m, 9H), 1.41–1.35 (m, 4H), 1.24 (m, 32H), 0.88 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 6H), 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 144.99, 140.62, 128.28, 123.96, 123.12, 35.83, 34.06, 31.91, 30.23, 29.58, 29.22, 28.64, 28.40, 28.39, 24.65, 22.68, 14.10, MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS (positive ion mode): m/z = 590.3103 [M]+, calcd for C34H54S4: 590.3103.


(4,8-Di(dodecylthio)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (M1). 
S-BDT (0.50 g, 0.85 mmol) and 20 mL of anhydrous THF were added into a flask under a N2 atmosphere. The solution was cooled to −78 °C before 0.8 mL of n-butyllithium (1.90 mmol, 2.5 M) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. After cooling to −78 °C, trimethyltin chloride (3.00 mmol, 1 M) was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was left to stir overnight. Quenched with water, the mixture was extracted with diethyl ether. The collected organic layers were washed and dried with MgSO4. After filtration and concentration via rotary evaporation, the residue was recrystallized using isopropanol to yield M1 as pale yellow needles (0.63 g, 81%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.80 (s, 2H), 3.00 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 4H), 1.59–1.52 (m, 7H), 1.44–1.39 (m, 4H), 1.28–1.20 (m, 32H), 0.88 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 6H), 0.53–0.40 (m, 18H), 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 148.95, 143.53, 141.38, 131.72, 121.13, 35.79, 31.90, 30.14, 29.61, 29.33, 29.19, 28.66, 22.67, 14.10, −6.89, −8.31, −9.78.


Synthesis of polymers. 
The polymers were synthesized using a similar procedure. Monomers BTBO (or BTBTQx, TPD) (0.2 mmol) and M1 (0.2 mmol) were added into a two-necked flask containing dry toluene (8 mL). The solution was deoxygenated by bubbling N2 for 10 min before Pd2(dba)3 (0.0366 g, 2 mol%) and P(o-tol)3 (0.0486 g, 8 mol%) were added against a N2 stream. The reaction mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 48 h under a N2 atmosphere. 2-Bromothiophene (0.02 g, 0.12 mmol) was added with a small amount of catalysts for end-capping, and the reaction mixture was further refluxed for 6 h. Trimethylthiophen-2-yl-stannane (0.04 g, 0.16 mmol) was then added. After another 6 h, the reaction mixture was poured into methanol (200 mL). The suspension was filtered and washed with hexane and acetone. The crude polymer was further extracted in a Soxhlet thimble with methanol, acetone and hexane for 24 h each. The residue was then washed down with chloroform. The solution was concentrated to re-precipitate the polymer from methanol. The collected solid was dried under vacuum overnight to afford the title polymers as black solids. PBDT-DTBO (0.181 g, 80%); 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.51–7.30 (4H), 7.15–6.91 (2H), 4.42–4.15 (4H), 3.11–2.95 (4H), 2.41–0.45 (76H); GPC: Mn = 11.6 kDa, Mw = 35.0 kDa, PDI = 3.03.

3. Device fabrication and characterization
BHJ solar cells were prepared on ITO glass substrates, which were ultrasonicated sequentially in deionized water, acetone, deionized water and isopropanol. Immediately prior to device fabrication, the substrates were treated by oxygen plasma cleaning for 10 min. Firstly, a thin film (45 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS, H.C. Starck) was spin-coated and then baked at 150 °C for 10 min. Secondly, the blend solutions (20 mg mL−1) of polymer and PCBM with different weight ratios in CF, CB or o-OCB containing 0–5% (v/v) DIO were filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter and then spin-coated onto ITO glass at 1000 rpm (or unless specified) for 60 s. Then, 1.0 nm LiF layer (0.2 A s−1) and 100 nm Al (2 A s−1) layer were thermally evaporated on the active layer at a pressure of 1.0 × 10−6 mbar through a shadow mask (active area: 7.25 mm2). To obtain convincing data, 20 devices with the same configuration were prepared under the same processing conditions, with the average values and variances of the device PCE values reported.
The J–V characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 (I–V) digital source meter under a simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) solar irradiator (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The light intensity was calibrated by a certified Oriel Reference Cell (91150V) and verified with a NREL calibrated Hamamatsu S1787-04 diode. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was obtained using a certified IPCE instrument (Zolix Instruments Inc., SolarCellScan100).
Results and discussion
The synthesis route of the polymers is illustrated in Scheme 1. The facile synthesis of S-BDT was performed using 4,8-trifated BDT as the electrophile for carbon–sulfur formation. Starting from 4,8-dihydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-4,8-dione, a two-step protocol afforded BDT triflate 2 in an overall 73% yield. The S-BDT was obtained in high yield (≥90%) by a further palladium-catalyzed coupling between 2 and alkylthiol.18a The S-BDT tin reagent (M1) was readily prepared with trimethyltin chloride in 81% yield.18b The monomers DTBTQx, DTBO and TPD were synthesized according to the procedure in the literature,19,20 with the synthesis details described in the ESI.† The polycondensation between M1 and DTBTQx, DTBO or TPD was carried out via the Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction to afford the PBDT-DTBTQx, PBDT-DTBO and PBDT-TPD polymers. After polymerization, end-capping was carried out in a stepwise manner using 2-bromothiophene and trimethylthiophen-2-ylstannane. The details of polymer synthesis and characterization are described in the Experimental section.

All the polymers were highly soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene, (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The molecular weight of the polymers was measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using tetrahydrofuran as the eluent. The number molecular weight (Mn) of PBDT-DTBO, PBDT-DTBTQx and PBDT-TPD was 35.1, 36.5 and 33.2 kDa, with the corresponding polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.03, 2.39 and 1.75, respectively.
The thermal stability of the polymers was evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). PBDT-DTBO, PBDT-DTBTQx and PBDT-TPD exhibited a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 305 °C, 368 °C and 356 °C, respectively (Fig. S16, ESI†). The thermal stability of these polymers was higher than the S-BDT homopolymer and similar to BDT copolymers in the literature, which is adequate for electronic device applications.
The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the polymers in both dilute CF solutions (1 × 10−5 M) and films are shown in Fig. 1. Further, the related optical data are summarized in Table 1. PBDT-DTBO and PBDT-TPD show similar absorption profiles in solution, featuring a strong absorption band with different absorption maxima (582 nm for the former and 540 nm for the latter). In comparison to PBDT-TPD, PBDT-DTBO had red-shifted absorption, which could be attributed to the π–π* transitions in the polymer backbone.1 The π–π* transitions of PBDT-DTBO are further located in the high-energy region and, thus, its π-electrons might be more efficiently delocalized than those of PBDT-TPD. This behavior is in good agreement with the computational calculations of HOMO, as discussed later. However, the PBDT-DTBTQx solution in CF shows an “M” type absorption spectrum, featuring two absorption maxima at 486 nm and 890 nm, respectively. The absorption in the short wavelength region is attributed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone, while the peak at longer wavelengths was ascribed to the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between the BDT donating unit and the thiadiazoloquinoxaline accepting unit.20 In comparison to DTBO and TPD, DTBTQx exhibits stronger electron-withdrawing ability, resulting in a much extended absorption band even beyond the near-infrared (NIR) region (>1000 nm).20

The polymer films exhibit broader and red-shifted absorption than their corresponding dilute solutions (Fig. 1b). Such an absorption shift indicates that strong intermolecular interaction and aggregation occurred in the solid-state of these polymers. This is probably related to the increased π–π stacking of the polymer backbones and polarizability of solid films. From the absorption onset (λedge) of the polymer films, the optical bandgap (Eoptg = 1240/λedge) of the polymers was estimated to be 1.67, 1.13 and 1.80 eV for PBDT-DTBO, PBDT-DTBTQx and PBDT-TPD, respectively. PBDT-DTBTQx showed the lowest bandgap (∼1 eV) due to the stronger π–π stacking and stronger electron-withdrawing nature of DTBTQx.
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of polymers can be estimated from the point where the current signals of oxidation and reduction potential start to deviate from the baseline in cyclic voltammetry (CV).15a As shown in Fig. 2a, PBDT-DTBO and PBDT-DTBTQx exhibit both oxidation and reduction potentials, while PBDT-TPD shows only oxidation potential. The HOMO level of PBDT-DTBO, PBDT-DTBTQx and PBDT-TPD was estimated to be −5.22, −5.35 and −5.37 eV, respectively. Compared with the similarly structured O-BDT based polymer PBDTBO,20a the thioalkoxy substituted PBDT-DTBO exhibited 0.35 eV lower HOMO level, which is in agreement with the literature report.15 The LUMO level of PBDT-DTBO and PBDT-DTBTQx was estimated to be 3.30 eV and −4.02 eV, respectively. The electrochemical bandgap (ECVg) of PBDT-DTBO and PBDT-DTBTQx was, thus, calculated to be 1.92 and 1.33 eV, respectively. The LUMO of PBDT-TPD was, however, estimated to be −3.57 eV using the following equation: LUMO = Eoptg + HOMO. Observing the energy level of polymers and PCBM (including PC61BM and PC71BM) plotted in Fig. 2b, one would find that the LUMO values of PBDT-DTBO and PBDT-TPD are positioned at least 0.3 eV above that of PCBM, which offer enough driving force for charge separation and transfer.21 However, PBDT-DTBTQx possesses a LUMO level close to that of PCBM, despite its deepest low-lying HOMO level. The LUMO level of PDBT-DTBTQx will limit its potential in PSCs applications, which is confirmed with the device data discussed later.

In order to clarify the electronic structures and energy levels of the polymers, a quantum chemistry calculation was performed by using the density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP/6-31G* basis set. To simplify the calculations, tetramers were employed with long alkyl chains replaced by methyl groups to save computation time. In particular, the molecular geometry, the HOMO and LUMO levels, and related electron distributions were calculated. The optimized molecular geometries and the frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. 3. Compared with PBDT-TPD, PBDT-DTBO and PBDT-DTBTQx exhibit good planarity along the polymer main chain, promoted by the flanking thiophenes on both BO and BTQx. The dihedral angles between the thiophene and BDT units were calculated to be ∼0.32° via the S⋯H noncovalent interactions. The introduction of alkoxy substituents on the BO rings was observed to decrease the dihedral angles (∼14.27°) between the thiophene and BO units, mainly due to the formation of S⋯O and N⋯H noncovalent interactions. Low dihedral angles in DTBTQx units were also observed for PBDT-DTBTQx via the N (in thiadiazole)⋯H (in thiophene) noncovalent interaction. But due to the steric hindrance induced by bulky BTQx, the planarity of PBDT-DTBTQx is slightly poorer than PBDT-DTBO.
 Fig. 3  Optimized geometries and molecular orbital surfaces of HOMO and LUMO of model tetramers obtained by DFT calculations. 
The electron density distributions of PBDT-DTBO and PBDT-DTBTQx at the HOMO surfaces are delocalized along the whole π-conjugated backbones, while the LUMO surfaces are mainly delocalized on the benzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole and quinoxaline units. PBDT-TPD exhibits slightly different electron density distribution, which is localized at the thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione unit for both HOMO and LUMO surfaces. The calculated HOMO levels of the tetramers are close to the experimental values. However, the calculated LUMO levels of the model tetramers are ∼0.8 eV higher than the experimental values, indicating that the LUMO levels are more sensitive to the π-conjugation length as well as the alkyl chain length in polymers.
The photovoltaic properties of the polymers were evaluated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/LiF/Al. All the devices were prepared under a N2 atmosphere and characterized in air without encapsulation, where the current density versus voltage (J–V) measurements were performed under the illumination of simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2). The representative J–V curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 4, and the key device parameters are summarized in Table 2.

The performance of PSCs is strongly affected by the device processing conditions, such as the choice of solvent, the use of additives, blend ratio, the use of PC71BM, and thermal annealing. Devices using different solvents were fabricated: the complete device characteristics are compared in Table S1 (ESI†). By using polymer/PC61BM as the active layer, PBDT-DTBTQx and PBDT-TPD based PSCs yielded fairly low PCE values, trivializing the impact study of processing conditions on device performance. Nevertheless, PBDT-DTBTQx/PC61BM (4:5 in weight ratio) processed with o-DCB delivered a PCE value of 0.24%, while PBDT-TPD/PC61BM (1:1, w/w) processed from o-DCB with the addition of 3% DIO achieved the highest PCE value of 1.28%. On the contrary, PBDT-DTBO based PSCs exhibited high photovoltaic performance. Interestingly, PBDT-DTBO/PC61BM devices achieved better performance when processed with CF solutions. PBDT-DTBO/PC61BM (1:1) devices exhibited a PCE value of 3.64%. Upon thermal annealing of the active layer at 50 °C, the PCE value of the device could be further improved to 4.24%, with Voc of 0.83 V, Jsc of 8.13 mA cm−2 and FF of 62.9%. This high Voc (∼0.83 V) of PBDT-DTBO is similar to the highest value among all the polymers based on BDT and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) units in the literature.19 The thermal annealing at a higher temperature (ca. 100 °C) and the addition of DIO, however, did not improve the devices performance further as expected.
In order to optimize the photovoltaic performance of PBDT-DTBO devices, PC71BM was used due to its better absorption properties than PC61BM. When blending with PC71BM in CF, devices with PBDT-DTBO/PC71BM at the weight ratio of 1:1 yielded the highest PCE value of 4.51% with Voc of 0.73 V, Jsc of 13.75 mA cm−2, and FF of 44.7%. For PBDT-DTBO/PC71BM devices, the addition of DIO was found to significantly improve the FF values of devices, which is in good agreement with the literature.22 With the addition of 1% DIO, the devices presented ∼0.1 V improved Voc and FF, resulting in the highest PCE value of 5.63%, with Voc of 0.83 V, Jsc of 10.24 mA cm−2, and FF of 66.3%. This improvement can be clearly observed from the J–V curves in Fig. 5a. The increase of PC71BM loading led to decreased Jsc values, i.e., Jsc decreased to 8.27 and 6.60 mA cm−2 for PC71BM weight ratios of 1:2 and 1:3, respectively. This may be presumably ascribed to the decreased hole mobility and increased phase segregation.

The absorption of the blend films is another factor to contribute towards the increased PCE. By changing the concentration of mixture solutions or adjusting the spin-coating speed, we studied the correlation between the absorption of active layers and device performance. When the active layer was spin-coated with higher concentrations of mixture solution (ca. 30 mg mL−1), PBDT-DTBO/PC61BM devices showed decreased FF, probably due to the increased phase aggregation. The active layers (thickness: ∼100 nm) spin-coated at 1200 rpm were found to afford the best devices.
External quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the devices were measured to evaluate the photoresponse of polymers and calibrate the Jsc data (Fig. 4b and d). Among the polymers, the higher values of EQE were observed for PBDT-DTBO/PC71BM devices. Efficient photo-conversion efficiency was obtained in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm, with EQE values reaching 50–60%. Comparing with PBDT-DTBO/PC61BM devices, the PC71BM based devices showed distinctly high photo-conversion efficiency with values above 50% from 370 to 630 nm. The Jsc values of PBDT-DTBO devices integrated from the EQE curves are rather consistent with the values obtained by J–V measurement.
The J–V curves and EQE plots for the best devices of PBDT-DTBTQx and PBDT-TPD are shown in Fig. 4b and d. The low performance of PBDT-DTBTQx was attributed to rather low Voc (0.5 V) and Jsc, as well as the poor photo-conversion efficiency, with EQE less than 4% in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm. PBDT-TPD devices exhibit rather high Voc (∼0.8 V), which is benefitted from its lower HOMO level. However, its performance is limited by the low Jsc, which is attributed to the insufficient photo-conversion efficiency, with EQE less than 8% in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm.
Finally, the charge transport properties of the polymers were studied by fabricating a bottom-gate top-contact field effect transistor (FET).23 The hole mobility of 3.6 × 10−4, 2.3 × 10−5 and 5.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for PBDT-DTBO, PBDT-DTBTQx and PBDT-TPD, respectively. PBDT-DTBO exhibited one-order magnitude higher hole mobility than the other two polymers. And this hole mobility is comparable to most of the reported highly efficient BDT polymers for PSCs,12 which can be attributed to the good planarity of the polymer backbone to promote the intramolecular packing and inter-chain packing of polymer chains. The relatively high hole mobility of PBDT-DTBO endowed its PSCs with good Jsc, with the highest value up to 13.75 mA cm−2.
To correlate the device performance with the morphology of the active layers, surface morphology of the blend film was investigated by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 5a–c, the polymer/PC61BM film exhibits a root means square roughness (RMS) of 2.32, 2.44, and 0.903 nm for PBDT-DTBTQx, PBDT-DTBO and PBDT-TPD, respectively. Nanoscale phase separation was observed between the D and A domains for all the active layers with clear interfaces. Though the PBDT-DTBTQx/PC61BM film exhibited rather good morphology, its poor device performance was attributed to its LUMO level approximating that of PC61BM, which could not offer enough driving force for charge separation and transfer. The low surface roughness of PBDT-TPD/PC61BM may be ascribed to the good miscibility between the D and A domains. Just like other higher PCE active layers, both PBDT-DTBO/PC61BM blend films processed using CF and PBDT-DTBO/PC71BM films using CF with or without the addition of DIO showed a higher surface roughness value and exhibited fine phase separation domains, leading to more efficient charge transport.
For a better understanding of the impact of DIO additive on the morphology of the active layers, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) morphology of PBDT-DTBO/PC71BM blend films processed without or with DIO additive was studied. It is well known that the photoexcitation recombination lengths are typically around 10 nm in these disordered materials; the length scale for this self-assembly must be of the order of 10–20 nm.5 As shown in Fig. 5e, typical “sea-island” morphology with clear interfaces for immiscible blends was observed for PBDT-DTBO/PC71BM films, where dispersed “island” phases formed with a domain size of 100–200 nm. The domain sizes were much greater than the typical organic exciton diffusion length, which thereby limited the device performance.24 With the addition of DIO (Fig. 5f), the clear interfaces between the interpenetrating D and A domains disappeared, mainly due to the improved miscibility between the polymer and fullerene. More homogeneous and finer phase separation within the nanoscale was achieved. This significantly improved the morphology in the active layers, facilitating the charge transfer between the interfaces and resulting in higher FF value and, therefore, device performance in PSC applications.
Conclusions
Three alkylthio BDT based low bandgap polymers were designed by the careful consideration of intermolecular noncovalent interactions to promote the planarity of polymer main chains. PBDT-DTBO exhibited the highest PCE of 5.63% with Voc = 0.83 V, Jsc = 10.24 mA cm−2 and FF = 66.3% after device optimization. The high Jsc value of PBDT-DTBO devices was attributed to their rather high hole mobility (1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The polymer with a quinoxaline accepting unit exhibited wide absorption spectra extending beyond the NIR region and a LUMO level approaching that of PCBM, which makes it possible to use it as an acceptor for all-polymer cells or tandem and ternary blend PSCs.16,25,26 TPD polymer yielded a PCE value of 1.27%, which may provide guidance in designing similarly structured materials for high PCE.8,27,28 The device engineering, including the screen of solvents and processing additives, acceptor selection, thermal annealing, interface engineering and spin-coating speed, is of importance to achieve high-performance PSCs.30 These polymers with different absorption profiles could be a reference for the future material design.
