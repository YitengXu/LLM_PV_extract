, Accepted 21st December 2012First published on 9th January 2013AbstractTwo new conjugated polymers based on trifluoromethylated thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-ethyl carboxylate have been synthesized. The incorporation of a trifluoromethyl group at the 3-position of a thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-ethyl carboxylate unit has shown pronounced steric and electronic effects and significantly altered the optical and electrochemical properties of polymers. Trifluoromethylation reduces both the HOMO and the LUMO levels of new polymers compared with their non-trifluoromethylated counterparts. A relatively large trifluoromethyl group on the 3-position of thieno[3,4-b]thiophene can result in a significant twist of the conjugated main-chains from planarity and thus disrupt the effective conjugation in polymers with aryl repeating units. This steric hindrance can be relieved by using an alkynyl linker. Solar cell devices with PPDA-TTCF3 as a donor and PC61BM as an acceptor have been fabricated and evaluated.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention recently because of their potential application as a low cost and renewable energy source.1–3 Significant progress has been made in polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell research in the past few years.4–20 In a typical polymer BHJ solar cell, the photoactive layer is a blend of donor polymer and fullerene acceptor.1,2,20 Among the common design characteristics for donor polymers in fullerene based BHJ devices are low optical gap such that photons across a broad range of the solar spectrum may be harvested, high ionization potential energy level for high open circuit voltage (Voc), balanced crystallinity and solubility for high hole mobility, and well-matched energy levels between polymers and those of fullerenes for efficient charge separation.2,21–23 Thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) based conjugated polymers have been studied extensively as low optical-gap polymers for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications.24,25 Low optical-gap polymers have been synthesized through the incorporation of groups whose valence bond descriptions have a contribution from a quinoid resonance form in the ground state. However, the downsides of the TT containing polymers are high-lying HOMO energy levels which can lead to a lower Voc in solar cell devices.5,25–27 Studies have been focused on tuning of the HOMO energy levels of TT based polymers. Various electron-withdrawing groups such as ester,5,25,28 ketone,29 sulfonyl,16 fluorine30,31 have been introduced as substituents on TTs and their co-monomers to lower the HOMOs of polymers.
Trifluoromethyl group is a strong electron-withdrawing group. It has attracted considerable interest in chemical, pharmaceutical and materials science because it can alter some important properties of materials, such as solubility, lipophilicity, thermal and chemical stability and redox potentials.32 It has been successfully incorporated into some organic optoelectronic materials such as organic light emitting diodes,33 organic field-effect transistors34,35 and organic solar cells.36 Herein, we report the synthesis of new conjugated polymers PBDT-TTCF3 and PPDA-TTCF3 based on trifluoromethylated thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-ethyl carboxylate (Scheme 1). The optical and electrochemical properties of polymers PBDT-TTCF3 and PPDA-TTCF3 were compared with those of their non-trifluoromethylated counterparts. The incorporation of a trifluoromethyl group at the 3-position of a TT unit imparted pronounced steric and electronic effects on polymers. The effect of the co-monomer structure on the optical and electrochemical properties has also been studied. A power conversion efficiency of 1.56% and an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.93 V were achieved in BHJ polymer solar cell devices based on PPDA-TTCF3.

Results and discussion
Monomer and polymer synthesis
A synthetic route for monomers and polymers is shown in Scheme 1. 3,4-Dibromothiophene was converted to 4-bromo-3-thienyllithium, which was reacted with ethyl trifluoroacetate at −78 °C to give 1-(4-bromothiophene-3-yl)-2,2,2-trifluoroethanone (1) in 82% yield. Compound 1, ethyl thioglycolate, potassium carbonate and copper(II) oxide nanopowder were mixed in dimethylformamide and heated to 60 °C for 12 h to obtain 3-(trifluoromethyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-ethylcarboxylate (2) in 21% yield.37 Compound 2 was brominated with N-bromosuccinimide at room temperature to form 4,6-dibromo-3-(trifluoromethyl)thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-ethylcarboxylate(3) in 90% yield.
Polymer PBDT-TTCF3 was synthesized by Stille cross-coupling reaction in the presence of tris(dibenzylidene-acetone)dipalladium as a catalyst and tri-o-tolylphosphine as a ligand. Polymers PPDA-TTCF3 and PPDA-TT were synthesized by Sonogashira coupling reactions. The crude polymers were precipitated in methanol and were collected by filtration. PBDT-TTCF3 was purified by washing with methanol and acetone sequentially in a Soxhlet extractor for 24 h each and was extracted with hot hexane in a Soxhlet extractor for 24 h. After removing the solvent under reduced pressure, a red solid was collected. PPDA-TTCF3 and PPDA-TT were purified by washing with methanol and hexane sequentially in a Soxhlet extractor for 24 h each, and then were extracted with hot chloroform in a Soxhlet extractor for 24 h. After removing the solvent under reduced pressure, purple and red solids were collected, respectively. Polymer PBDT-TTCF3 shows good solubility in toluene, chloroform, chlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran and hot hexane. Polymers PPDA-TTCF3 and PPDA-TT are soluble in toluene, chloroform, chlorobenzene and tetrahydrofuran. Molecular weights and polydispersity indices (PDIs) of the polymers are summarized in Table 1.

Thermal properties
The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of the polymers are shown in Fig. S1,† and the TGA results are listed in Table 1. All the polymers showed decomposition temperatures above 300 °C. New polymers were thermally stable for applications in optoelectronic devices.30 The DSC thermograms of the polymers are shown in Fig. S2.† Polymer PBDT-TTCF3 displayed a glass transition around 100 °C, and the other two polymers showed no thermal transition in the range of 50 to 250 °C.
Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of polymers PBDT-TTCF3, PPDA-TT and PPDA-TTCF3 in dilute chloroform solution (1 × 10−5 M) and as thin films are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The optical properties of the polymers are summarized in Table 2. The absorption maxima (λmax) of the trifluoromethylated polymer PBDT-TTCF3 were at 495 nm in dilute chloroform solution and at 508 nm as a thin film. The related polymers, which did not have trifluoromethyl substitutions, showed absorption maxima (λmax) at 670 nm in dilute chloroform solution and at 673 nm as a thin film.38 Large blue-shifts of absorption spectra were observed after trifluoromethylation of the polymer. The absorption maxima (λmax) of the PBDT-TTCF3 thin film only showed a slight red-shift (6 nm) compared with that of chloroform solution. The optical absorption spectrum of PBDT-TTCF3 is undesirable for PSC applications. A recent theoretical analysis showed that the van der Waals volume and the shape of the trifluoromethyl group were close to those of the ethyl group in terms of steric impact on neighbouring groups.39 The steric hindrance of trifluoromethyl groups likely disrupted the conjugation of the polymer chain and resulted in blue-shifted absorption spectra of PBDT-TTCF3. To avoid the disruption of conjugation caused by bulk substituent, we synthesized polymer PPDA-TTCF3. The thiophene units were replaced by acetylenes as linking groups in this polymer. A related polymer PPDA-TT which did not have trifluoromethyl substituent, was also synthesized for comparison. The absorption maxima (λmax) of PPDA-TTCF3 and PPDA-TT were at 532 and 515 nm in dilute chloroform solution and were at 603 and 551 nm as thin-films, respectively. The absorption maxima of PPDA-TTCF3 were red-shifted 32 nm in solution and 94 nm in the solid state compared with those of PBDT-TTCF3. The acetylene linkers significantly reduced steric hindrance, effectively improved conjugation in polymers and resulted in red-shifted absorption spectra. The absorption maxima of PPDA-TTCF3 were red-shifted 17 nm in solution and 52 nm as a thin film compared with those of PPDA-TT. The trifluoromethylated polymer PPDA-TTCF3 also showed a higher absorption coefficient than that of PPDA-TT in the 300 to 680 nm region (Fig. 1a and Table 2 and ESI†). The optical gaps of the polymers were calculated from the onset absorption spectra and they were 1.95, 1.93 and 1.82 eV for PBDT-TTCF3, PPDA-TT and PPDA-TTCF3, respectively.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the polymers. The redox potentials were estimated from the onsets of the oxidation and reduction. All voltammograms were calibrated using the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple. Its energy level was assumed at −4.8 eV relative to vacuum.40 The electrochemical potentials were converted roughly to the corresponding energy levels by the following equations:41EHOMO = −(4.8 − E1/2,Fc,Fc+ + Eox,onset) = −(4.75 + Eox,onset) eVELUMO = −(4.8 − E1/2,Fc,Fc+ + Ered,onset) = −(4.75 + Ered,onset) eVwhere the half-wave potential of Fc/Fc+ (E1/2,Fc,Fc+) was found to be 0.05 V relative to the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. The Ered,onset and Eox,onset were the onset reduction and oxidation potentials relative to the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode, respectively.
The onset reduction and oxidation potentials and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are summarized in Table 2, while the CV plots of the polymer thin films are displayed in Fig. 2. The onset reduction and oxidation potentials of the PBDT-TTCF3 film appeared at −1.20 and 0.77 V, corresponding to LUMO and HOMO energy levels of −3.55 and −5.52 eV respectively. However, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of PBDT-TT according to previous reports28,38,42 were approximately at −3.4 and −5.1 eV, respectively. This indicates that the trifluoromethyl unit on the TT can significantly reduce both LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the resulting polymer. The onset oxidation of PPDA-TTCF3 and PPDA-TT films was at 0.71 and 0.46 V, corresponding to the HOMO energy levels of −5.46 and −5.24 eV, respectively. The onset reduction of PPDA-TTCF3 and PPDA-TT thin films was located at −1.21 and −1.33 V, corresponding to LUMO energy levels of −3.54 and −3.42 eV, respectively. The trifluoromethyl group substantially reduced both LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the polymer PPDA-TTCF3 compared with the non-trifluoromethylated analogue PPDA-TT. The HOMO energy levels of PBDT-TTCF3 and PPDA-TTCF3 were suitable for applying as donor materials in polymer solar cell devices.

Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic properties of the three new polymers were investigated in BHJ solar cell devices. The device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS (∼45 nm)/polymer:PC61BM/LiF (6 Å)/Al (100 nm), where PEDOT:PSS and LiF layers were employed as buffer layers to facilitate hole and electron extractions. The devices were studied under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. The current–voltage curves of the polymer/PC61BM devices are displayed in Fig. 3a and the photovoltaic performance is listed in Table 3. The devices based on PPDA-TTCF3/PC61BM (1:1, w/w) displayed a Voc of 0.91 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 2.03 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.50, yielding a PCE of 0.92% (Table 3 and ESI†). After adding a small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane in spin-coating solution, the Jsc values were dramatically enhanced due to the improvement of the electron mobility of the acceptor. The devices based on PPDA-TTCF3/PC61BM (1:1, w/w, with DIO) demonstrated a PCE of 1.56% with a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 3.10 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.54. A relatively high Voc of 0.93 V of the device can be attributed to the lower-lying HOMO energy level of PPDA-TTCF3. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices of PPDA-TTCF3/PC61BM (1:1, w/w, without and with DIO) are shown in Fig. 3b. The EQE curves of the devices displayed peaks in the 300–700 nm region. However, the EQE values were low through the whole region. These corresponded to the low photocurrents of PPDA-TTCF3/PC61BM devices. The device processed with DIO as an additive (1 vol%) exhibited higher EQE and higher Jsc values (Table 3 and ESI†). The devices based on PBDT-TTCF3/PC61BM (1:1, w/w) and PPDA-TT/PC61BM (1:1, w/w) showed efficiencies below 1% even after addition of the processing additive. The low performances of devices based on these new polymers could be resulted from large band gaps and low hole mobilities of the polymers.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments were performed to investigate the microstructures of polymer/PC61BM blend films (see ESI†). The blend films processed with DIO (1 vol%) were used for AFM study. The coarse morphologies were observed in all cases. PBDT-TTCF3/PC61BM, PPDA-TT/PC61BM and PPDA-TTCF3/PC61BM exhibited roughness values of 2.27 nm, 4.04 nm and 4.08 nm, respectively. The rough characters of thin films indicated that excessive phase separation may have happened, which can limit the device performance. The effect of an additive on the film morphology was also studied. Large isolated domains existed throughout the surface in the blend film of PPDA-TTCF3/PC61BM processed without DIO. This implied low miscibility between PPDA-TTCF3 and PC61BM (Fig. S14d†). The addition of DIO improved miscibility in the polymer/PC61BM blend (Fig. S14c†).
The hole mobilities of the three polymers were investigated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (see ESI†). The relationship between current and voltage in the hole-only devices of polymer films is shown in Fig. 4 and the calculated hole mobilities of polymers are listed in Table 4. The hole mobilities of PBDT-TTCF3, PPDA-TT and PPDA-TTCF3 films were 2.45 × 10−6, 8.10 × 10−6 and 1.03 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. All polymer/PC61BM blends showed a relatively low hole mobility which may be one of the reasons for low short-circuit current density (Jsc) values in OPV devices.

Experimental
Instrumentation
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Mercury plus 400 MHz instrument. Elemental analyses were performed at Shanghai institute of organic chemistry, Chinese academy of sciences. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses were carried out on a Shimadzu SIL-20A liquid chromatography instrument using tetrahydrofuran as an eluent with polystyrenes as standards. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a TA instrument Q5000IR at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under nitrogen gas flow. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies were carried out with a Perkin Elmer Pyris 1 under nitrogen flow. All samples (about 5.0 mg in weight) were first heated up to 250 °C and were held for 2 min to remove thermal history, followed by cooling at a rate of 10 °C min−1 to 25 °C and then heating at a rate of 10 °C min−1 to 250 °C. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 20 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted on a CHI 600 electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode cell under a nitrogen atmosphere in a deoxygenated anhydrous acetonitrile solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. A platinum disk electrode was used as a working electrode, a platinum wire was used as a counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M AgNO3 in acetonitrile) electrode was used as a reference electrode. The polymer films were coated on the surface of the platinum disk electrode. The CV curves were calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as an external standard which was measured under the same conditions before and after the measurement of samples. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a MultiMode V microscope. PSCs with device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/LiF/Al were fabricated as follows: a ca. 45 nm thick poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron P AI 4083) was spin-coated from an aqueous solution onto the pre-cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. The coated substrates were baked at 140 °C for 10 min in air and were transferred into a nitrogen filled glove box. A chlorobenzene solution of polymer (7 mg mL−1) and PC61BM blend at 1:1 weight ratios with or without 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The optimized thickness for the active layers was determined to be around 80 nm. The samples were transferred into an evaporator and a LiF layer (0.6 nm) and an Al layer (100 nm) were thermally deposited under a vacuum of 10−6 Torr. The device area was restricted to 7.25 mm2 by a shadow mask. The PCEs were measured in a glove box directly after fabrication. The devices for the EQE measurements were encapsulated in the glove box and measured in air. A Newport 94023A solar simulator equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp and an air mass (AM) 1.5G filter was used to generate a simulated AM 1.5G solar spectrum irradiation source. The irradiation intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated by a Newport standard silicon solar cell 91150. A Newport monochromator 74125 and power meter 1918 with silicon detector 918D were used in external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements.

Conclusions
Two new polymers based on trifluoromethylated thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-ethyl carboxylate have been synthesized. The optical and electrochemical properties of the new polymers have been compared with their non-trifluoromethylated counterparts. The trifluoromethyl substitutions on the TT unit significantly changes the optical and electrochemical properties of polymers. Both HOMO and LUMO levels of PBDT-TTCF3 and PPDA-TTCF3 are reduced in comparison to their non-trifluoromethylated counterparts. PPDA-TTCF3 also shows higher absorption coefficients than its non-trifluoromethylated counterpart. A relatively large trifluoromethyl group on the 3-position of TT can cause steric hindrance and disrupt the effective conjugation in polymers with aryl repeating units. PBDT-TTCF3 displays a much larger optical gap than its non-trifluoromethylated counterpart. The steric hindrance can be relieved by using an alkynyl linker. Solar cell devices with PPDA-TTCF3 as a donor and PC61BM as an acceptor have achieved a significantly improved open-circuit voltage of 0.93 eV and a moderate PCE of 1.56%. This work may provide some useful information for the rational design and synthesis of polymers for PSC applications.
