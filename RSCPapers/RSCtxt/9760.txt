    , Accepted 16th August 2018First published on 17th August 2018AbstractDesalination of seawater and renewable energy storage are quite promising for a sustainable society, but their combination for high efficiency is a difficult task. Herein, we demonstrate a dual-function battery, which is composed of a NaTi2(PO4)3 anode and a Ag cathode with NaCl aqueous electrolyte, for desalination and electrical energy storage. In a charging process, Na+ and Cl− are extracted from the electrolyte and inserted into the separate electrodes, while in a reverse process, the stored electricity and ions are released into electrolyte. As a demonstration, the dual-function battery can be continuously photocharged with a solar cell and discharged for 50 cycles without significant decrease in both the discharge voltage and capacity. This study will provide new insights into both seawater desalination and efficient renewable energy utilization.
Water scarcity and energy shortage are two great challenges for the modern society.1–3 Only 3% of water on the earth is fresh water, which can be consumed by human beings, while 97% is salt water.4,5 Distillation of seawater via heating is the widely applied desalination method but with low efficiency.6 Solar irradiation to generate water vapor by nanotechnology, followed by condensation to obtain pure water is a state-of-the-art method and promising.7,8 This method involves direct utilization of solar energy for desalination, which is the largest sustainable energy source. However, attempts on the simultaneous desalination of seawater and storage of electricity from renewable energy in an integrated device are limited and quite challenging.
Over the years, capacitive deionization (CDI) and electrodialysis (ED) are the two main eco-friendly technologies for desalination using electricity.9,10 The CDI method is based on adsorption of ions on the electrical double layer of each electrode, and its desalination capacity is strictly limited to the surface area of the electrodes.11,12 The ED technology critically depends on ion-exchange memebranes.13 Notably, the applicable voltage of the two methods is theoretically below 1.23 V due to water electrolysis. This indicates that the desalination capacity can only be enhanced by storage capability of electrodes. Battery, which accommodates ions in the bulk of electrodes, can deliver a high capacity and hence lead to highly efficient desalination.14–16 Several configurations of batteries, such as Ag/MnO2, TiS2/K20, AgCl/Na0.44MnO2, BiOCl/Na0.44MnO2 and NaTi2(PO4)3/Bi, were fabricated for desalination with Na+ and Cl− stored in separated electrodes upon charging.17–21 Moreover, the electricity converted from renewable energy near the sea (such as solar, wind, and tide energy) is dependent on the climate and is fluctuating; hence, it needs to be stored in a battery before use.22,23 Therefore, constructing a dual-function battery for both desalination and electrical energy storage will be of great interest and significance.
Herein, we report a dual-function battery with NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) as the anode, Ag foil as the cathode, and 1.0 M of NaCl as the aqueous electrolyte. This battery stores Na+ and Cl− in separate electrodes and desalinates the salt water, which can be driven by a solar cell; in a reverse process, the stored electrical energy can be released in additional electrolyte. This dual-function battery exhibits considerable desalination efficiency, excellent rate performance, and long cycle life. The reaction scheme has been confirmed by in situ and ex situ characterizations. The novel dual-function battery will merit promising applications in the fields of water desalination and electrical energy storage.
NTP was synthesized to uniformly mix with 7.7 wt% of multiwalled carbon nanotubes,24,25 as shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†). The as-prepared NTP was used as the anode and Ag foil was employed as the cathode. The battery configuration is illustrated in Scheme 1. Upon charging, the Na+ and Cl− ions are stored in the bulk phases of the NTP and Ag electrodes, driven by a solar cell. This realizes both desalination of the electrolyte and electrical energy storage in the battery. During discharging, the battery releases electrical energy via spontaneously reversible electrochemical reactions on the anode and cathode, and the stored ions can be released into electrolyte, as described in Scheme 1. The NTP anode exhibits a redox potential of −0.62 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), and the Ag cathode presents a redox couple of Ag/AgCl at 0.22 V vs. SHE.26–28 In principle, the battery can operate with an output voltage of 0.84 V. This configuration of battery can realize simultaneous utilization of renewable energy for desalination and electrical energy storage.
 Scheme 1  Schematic of the NTP/Ag dual-function battery for desalination and electrical energy storage. 
The feasibility of NTP and Ag electrodes was separately examined in a three electrode-cell with saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and platinum as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively, in 1.0 M NaCl aqueous electrolyte by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As presented in Fig. 1a, two couples of sharp redox peaks are observed, corresponding to the (de)intercalation of Na+ from/into NTP and the extraction/insertion of Cl− into Ag, respectively. Clearly, both the electrodes work in the stable electrochemical window of the aqueous electrolyte, and present fast CV responses, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The full NTP/Ag battery was assembled in a two-electrode configuration. Fig. 1b shows the CV curves of the NTP/Ag battery in a voltage window of 0.4–1.2 V at different scan rates ranging from 0.1 to 10 mV s−1. Reversible redox peaks are still obtained with the increase in scan rates, suggesting good kinetics. At 0.1 mV s−1, the symmetric anodic and cathodic peaks are located at 0.87 and 0.78 V, respectively, which are consistent with the theoretical values.

The typical discharge/charge curves of the NTP/Ag battery are presented at varied current densities in Fig. 1c. The battery can deliver reversible capacities from 93.3 mA h g−1 to 90.6, 86.7, 82.7, 78.3, 78.4, 76.7, and 76.0 mA h g−1 based on the anode mass at current densities from 0.5 C to 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 C (1 C = 100 mA g−1), respectively. Flat plateaus at 0.88 V on charge and 0.84 V on discharge are observed at 0.5 C, respectively, indicating a small voltage gap of 0.04 V and hence fast kinetics at both anode and cathode. Furthermore, the profiles of galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) in Fig. S4 (ESI†) exhibit small polarizations and excellent reversibility, which are in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 1c. Compared to the reported desalination batteries and aqueous sodium-ion batteries, as displayed in the Ragone plots of Fig. 1d, the energy and power densities of the NTP/Ag battery are very promising and competitive, suggesting its better desalination capability.18–20,25,29,30 The long cycle performance at 10 C and good rate capability are presented in Fig. 1e and its inset, respectively. The charge/discharge capacity remains at 50 mA h g−1 after 1500 cycles, indicative of a capacity retention of 70% and capacity loss of 0.02% per cycle. Moreover, the NTP/Ag battery also exhibits good electrochemical performance at different concentrations of NaCl electrolyte, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). This is attributed to the fast kinetics and good stability of both electrodes and the high ionic conductivity of the aqueous electrolyte. These are confirmed by the stable impedance of the battery during cycles in the electrochemical impedance spectra (Fig. S6 (ESI†)). These results indicate that the NTP/Ag battery can work for highly efficient desalination with good electrochemical performance.
The desalination and electrical energy storage processes of the NTP/Ag battery are revealed by different characterization techniques. Fig. 2a displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Ag electrode at selected states in the first cycle of desalination and electricity release, corresponding to its charge and discharge processes. The characteristic diffraction peaks of the discharge product AgCl at 27.5°, 32.0°, 46.0°, 54.6°, 57.2°, 67.2° and 74.4° appear and gradually get pronounced, indicating the extraction of Cl− from the electrolyte. This process is also monitored by Raman spectra (Fig. S7 (ESI†)), and consistent with the larger impedance of the battery at the charged state than at the discharged state (Fig. S6 (ESI†)) due to the poor conductivity of AgCl. In a reverse process, Ag is recovered from AgCl. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses on the Ag electrode during charge and discharge (Fig. 2b) exhibit the reversible capture and release of Cl− from the electrolyte.31 This is in agreement with the EDS elemental mappings in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The Ag foil becomes porous after repeated cycles, as presented in Fig. S9 (ESI†). These results indicate that the Ag electrode can reversibly capture Cl− by forming AgCl from the electrolyte for desalination.
 Fig. 2  (a) Ex situ XRD patterns and (b) EDS spectra of the Ag electrode at different states in the first cycle. 
On the anode side, NTP is (de)intercalated with Na+ from the electrolyte during charge/discharge by coupling with the Ag cathode. This process is monitored by in situ XRD with a sampling interval of 8 minutes during (de)sodiation of the first cycle at 0.5 C (Fig. 3a). Upon charging, a series of new diffraction peaks appear at 23.5°, 31.8°, 35.1° and 45.7° with gradually increased intensity, in addition to the diffraction peaks of NTP, parafilm, and stainless steel current collector. This suggests the formation of a new phase, Na3Ti2(PO4)3.32 In the following discharging process, the diffraction peaks of Na3Ti2(PO4)3 decrease in intensity and eventually disappear at full-charged state with the recovery of NTP. The reversible phase change between Na3Ti2(PO4)3 and NaTi2(PO4)3 is directly revealed by their well-developed facets of (202) and (211) in the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Fig. 3b and c, respectively) as well as their characteristic diffraction spots in the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (insets). In order to further confirm the valence change of Ti in NaTi2(PO4)3 for charge compensation, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted in a charge and discharge cycle.
 Fig. 3  (a) In situ XRD patterns of the NTP electrode at different states, (b) and (c) HRTEM images of the NTP electrode charged to 1.2 V and discharged to 0.4 V, respectively, and (d) XPS spectra of Ti in NTP at different states in the first cycle. Insets are the SAED patterns. 
The typical peaks of Ti 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 at binding energies of 465.4 and 459.7 eV (Fig. 3d) suggest the valence state of +4 of Ti in the pristine electrode. With charging, the XPS peaks are clearly broadened, indicative of multiple oxidation states of Ti in the electrode. The binding energies at 463.7 and 458.1 eV imply reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+.33 The reversible oxidation process of Ti3+ to Ti4+ is monitored in the discharging process, as depicted in Fig. 3d. It is clear that NTP as an anode is (de)intercalated with Na+ from the electrolyte, in which Ti3+/Ti4+ is responsible for its charge compensation.
The full battery with NTP as the anode and Ag foil as the cathode is revealed to desalinate with Na+ and Cl− from the electrolyte into the separate electrodes and reversibly release electrical energy in a discharging process. A design flowchart of integration of the dual-function battery and a solar cell is shown in Fig. 4a. The structure of the battery is displayed in Fig. S10 (ESI†), and the open-circuit voltage of the solar cell is 1.68 V (Fig. S11†). The desalination is triggered by solar irradiation in daytime as well as conversion and storage of electrical energy converted from the sun. Moreover, the stored electricity can be released and used by end users. This battery process realizes the efficient utilization of solar energy and its conversion and storage, which strongly depends on the weather conditions. Notably, under sunlight irradiation (∼20 mW cm−2) for 5 min, the battery can be discharged for ∼70 mA h g−1 at 10 C with a stable voltage of 0.72 V, demonstrating higher salt adsorption capacity (SAC) of ∼151.5 mg g−1 than reported desalination batteries (Table S1, ESI†). No evident capacity decay and discharge voltage decrease are observed in the continuous operation of 50 cycles, as shown in Fig. 4b and S12.† Such high stability is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1e, and the reaction mechanism is revealed in Fig. 2 and 3.

In a photocharging process, desalination occurs with Na+ and Cl− captured in the separate anode and cathode, hence leading to variation in the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. Detection of conductivity is performed using a conductivity meter, with cell configuration depicted in Fig. S13 (ESI†). The conductivity of the electrolyte is almost linearly decreased with desalination triggered by solar irradiation, as shown in Fig. 4c and Fig. S14 (ESI†). In the discharging process, Na+ and Cl− are released from the electrodes to the electrolyte, resulting in linear increase in conductivity. These results confirm the reaction scheme of the dual-functional battery for desalination and electrical energy storage converted from the sun.
In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated a dual-function battery composed of a NTP anode, a Ag cathode, and NaCl aqueous electrolyte for desalination and electrical energy storage. It is photocharged with Na+ and Cl− extracted from the electrolyte into the separate electrode by a solar cell and discharged with the stored electricity and ions releasing. Due to the highly reversible battery reactions, this battery can be continuously photocharged and discharged for 50 cycles with no significant decrease in both the discharge voltage and capacity. A high energy density of 49.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 55.1 W kg−1 has been achieved. This study will provide new insights into seawater desalination and encourage more investigations into the efficient utilization of renewable energy.
