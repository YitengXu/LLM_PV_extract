    , Accepted 18th April 2013First published on 23rd April 2013Abstractα-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays on titanium foil have been assembled by a facile template-free method. At a rate of C/5 (5 h per charging cycle), their reversible capacity is ∼1059.9 mA h g−1, higher than that of pure α-Fe2O3 nanorod array electrodes (∼858.3 mA h g−1). After 30 cycles, the capacity is maintained at 807.1 mA h g−1. Such high performances can be attributed to the synergistic effect between nanostructured SnO2 and α-Fe2O3 and the nanoarray structures. α-Fe2O3 nanostructures with high electrochemical activity can activate the irreversible capacity of SnO2, and the nanoarray structures can provide good contact, short electron transporting paths, a high surface-to-volume ratio and open space in the system. These results indicate that one-dimensional nanocomposite arrays on metal foils are good candidates for high performance lithium ion batteries.
Introduction
Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted great attention due to their wide practical use in mobile phones, laptop computers and hybrid electric vehicles.1,2 In the most recent years, the development of self-charging power cells (SCPCs) and integrated solar-LIB power packs (SLPPs) have imposed higher requirements on the performance of electrode materials.3,4 Many efforts have been made to enhance the capacity and cyclability of anodes. Various transition metal oxides have been reported as promising candidates for high performance anodes.2,5–15 Among them, SnO2 has been considered to be a superior material compared with graphite due to its high theoretical capacity (782 mA h g−1).5,9–13,16–18 However, the low cyclability arising from the great volume change in the discharge–charge processes and the high irreversible capacity loss (the formation of Li2O is irreversible) greatly restricts their applications.5,9–13,16–23 Recently, nanostructured arrays growing on metal substrates, such as Co3O4 nanoarrays on copper foil, α-Fe2O3 nanoarrays on titanium foil, and NiO nanoarrays on nickel foil, have been reported to be very effective for enhancing cyclability because they can provide good contact, short electron transporting paths and high a surface-to-volume ratio.2,7,8 Introducing core–shell structured nanocomposites has been confirmed as a new way to activate the irreversible capacity of alloy-type metal oxides because the metal nanoclusters in the cores can reversibly convert extra Li2O to Li+.22,23 Thus, 1D core–shell nanoarrays should have both high cyclability and high reversible capacity. Nowadays, template synthesized 1D core–shell nanoarrays have been reported to have enhanced lithium storage performance as anodes of LIBs, such as C–α-Fe2O3 nanotube arrays19 and SnO2–Fe2O3 nanocomposites;20,21,24 template-free synthesis of such 1D core–shell nanoarrays and directly using them as anodes of LIBs still remain a challenge.
In this paper, α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays on titanium foil have been assembled by a facile two-step method without using any soft or hard templates. Excellent lithium storage performances have been achieved. At a rate of C/5, the reversible capacity is up to ∼1059.9 mA h g−1 and can be maintained at 807.1 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles. Such a good behavior can be attributed to the synergistic effect between nanostructured SnO2 and α-Fe2O3 and the nanoarray structures. The present results strongly support the potential application of these nanorod arrays in the anodes of LIBs, SCPCs and SLPPs.
Experimental details
Materials synthesis
All chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as purchased without purification. Firstly, α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays on a titanium substrate were prepared via a hydrothermal method.2 In a typical assembly process, FeCl3·6H2O (0.405 g) was dispersed into 30 mL distilled water by sonication for 10 min. Then Na2SO4 (0.205 g) was added and the ultimate mixed solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave. A piece of clean titanium foil was placed in the autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and kept at 120 °C for 6 h. After being cooled down to room temperature, the titanium foil with the α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays was collected and washed several times with distilled water and absolute ethanol. After drying at 60 °C for 12 h, the titanium foil with the α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays was annealed at 450 °C in Ar gas for 3 h at a rate of 5 °C min−1 to improve the contact between the nanoarrays and the substrate.
Secondly, α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays were prepared via a hydrothermal method.11 Na2SnO3·4H2O (0.145 g) and urea (1.16 g) were added into a beaker containing 16 mL distilled water and 24 mL ethanol. After the mixture was ultrasonically dispersed for 10 min and transferred into a 50 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave, the annealed titanium foil coated with α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays was immersed into the autoclave. Then the autoclave was sealed and kept at 180 °C for 6 h. After being cooled down to room temperature, the titanium foil was collected and washed several times with distilled water and absolute ethanol. Finally, the titanium foil was dried at 60 °C for 12 h.
Materials characterization
The crystal phase, morphology and microstructure of the α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays on titanium foil were characterized by, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD; D/max 2550 V, Cu Kα radiation) in a 2θ range from 10° to 70°, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100) with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), respectively.
Electrochemical measurement
Lithium storage performances of bare α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays and α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays on titanium foil, directly used as the anodes, were evaluated in CR2016 coin cells. Before fabrication of the CR2016 coin cells, a thermal treatment of the Ti foil coated with α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays was performed at 100 °C under vacuum for 12 h to eliminate the condensed water. Pieces with a diameter of 15 mm were cut off and directly used as the electrodes without any ancillary materials. The 2016 coin-type cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box, and pure Li foil was used as the counter electrode. The electrolyte was made of 1 M LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with a volume ratio of 1:1. The cells were galvanostatically charged and discharged between 0.001 and 3.00 V versus Li+/Li at room temperature on a program-controlled test system. It should be pointed out that the amount of the material used in the electrodes for the electrochemical characterization was ∼0.6 mg.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a is typical EDS analysis spectrum of the α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays, showing that there are three elements (Sn, Fe and O) in the system. The C and Cu peaks come from the copper grid coated with a carbon membrane that is used as the support in the TEM observations. There are no other sharp peaks from any impurity elements, indicating that the products are highly pure. Such EDS analyses were performed on ten other regions and similar results were obtained. The mass percentage of SnO2 in the α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays is ∼15%, calculated by analyzing the mass before and after coating with SnO2 for several tens of samples. It should be noted that the mass of α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays is almost unchanged after thermal treatment, indicating that the amount of stannic hydroxide is very small. XRD patterns of α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays and α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays on titanium foil are shown in Fig. 1b. On the red curve, all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to rhombohedral α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS card no. 33-0664).15,19–21,24 On the black curve, the two broad peaks that appeared at a 2θ of 25–29° and 33.6–35° (marked with #) can be indexed to the (110) plane and the (101) plane of tetragonal SnO2 crystal (JCPDS card No. 41-1445), respectively.9–12,16,17,20

The inset shows a side view SEM image of an α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays. The height of the α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays is ∼600 nm and the nanorod arrays are vertically aligned on the titanium foil. The enlarged FESEM image shows the tips of the α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays (Fig. 2b). The α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorods have diameters of 60–120 nm and lengths of 500–800 nm. Fig. 2c and 2d show TEM images of bare α-Fe2O3 nanorods and α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorods, respectively. The average diameter of α-Fe2O3 nanorods is ∼60 nm. As shown in Fig. 2d, α-Fe2O3 nanorods are uniformly coated with SnO2 nanoparticles and the average thickness of the SnO2 nanoparticle layer is ∼20 nm. A HRTEM image of α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorods is shown in Fig. 2e. The lattice space of 0.33 nm corresponds to the (110) lattice plane of SnO2.9–11,22,23Fig. 2f shows the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorods, showing two different natures of the crystals. The diffraction pattern can be indexed to SnO2 and α-Fe2O3, and their crystal information has been marked.

The lithium storage performances of α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays on titanium foil and α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays on titanium foil directly used as anodes are investigated by galvanostatic charging–discharging between 0.001 and 3.0 V at a rate of C/5 (5 h per charging cycle). As shown in Fig. 3a, the initial capacity of α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays is 1266.4 mA h g−1, and the reversible capacity (the 2nd cycle) is 1059.9 mA h g−1, which is maintained at 807.1 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles. Such a reversible capacity is higher than that of α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays on titanium foil (858.3 mA h g−1 as shown in Fig. 3b) and higher than the previously reported reversible capacities of α-Fe2O3 based nanostructures,2,6,19 SnO2 based nanostructures10,12,13,16–18 and α-Fe2O3–SnO2 heterostructured nanocomposites.20,21,24Fig. 3c and 3d show the derivative relation of the galvanostatic voltage vs. the capacity of the nanorod arrays at the 1st, 2nd and 10th cycle, indicating their lithiation and delithiation processes. For α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays (Fig. 3d), the peak around 0.82 V in the 1st cycle corresponds to the coexistence of two Li-intercalated phases, hexagonal and cubic:6,19 Fe2O3 + 2Li+ + 2e− → Li2(Fe2O3)(1)

The derivative relation of the galvanostatic voltage vs. the capacity of α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays on titanium foil (c) and α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays on titanium foil (d). 
The peak at about 0.77 V corresponds with the reduction of Fe3+ ions and the formation of Li2O:6,19 Li2(Fe2O3) + 4Li+ + 4e− → 2Fe0 + 3Li2O(2)
An extra peak is seen at 1.69 V and disappears in the sequential cycles, which can be attributed to the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The charge peak that appears around 1.5–2 V corresponds to the conversion reaction of metallic Fe0 to Fe2+:2,6,15,19 2Fe0 + 2Li2O ↔ 2FeO + 4Li+ + 4e−(3)
Fe nanoclusters have a high electrochemical activity and can reversibly convert Li2O to Li+. It has been confirmed that Fe nanostructures can easily absorb oxygen atoms, which intensify the surface electrochemical activity.22,23 For this reason, nanostructured metallic Fe may reversibly convert extra Li2O in this system to Li+. The SnO2 nanostructures in this system can only provide extra Li2O. For the α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays (Fig. 3c), in the 1st cycle, the main peaks appear at 0.50, 0.60 and 0.90 V. The peak at 0.5 V corresponds to the conversion of SnO2 to metalic Sn, in which Li2O is formed:9,10,12,13,16,20 SnO2 + 4Li+ + 4e− → 2Li2O + Sn(4)
The anodic peak at 0.65 V in the sequential cycles can be attributed to the lithiation reaction of metalic Sn:9,10,12,13,16,20 Sn + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixSn (0 ≤ x ≤ 4.4)(5)
Therefore, the extra Li2O produced in the conversion of SnO2 to metallic Sn can be reversibly converted to Li+ by nanostructured metallic Fe, leading to a much higher capacity. The delithiation peak around 1.6–2.0 V for α-Fe2O3–SnO2 nanorod arrays is broader and higher than that for pure α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays, further confirming that Fe converts the extra Li2O to Li+.22,23 In addition, LixSn contributes to the higher capacity. Their reversible capacity can be written as follows: (4 + 2x)FeO + (8 + 4x)Li+ + (8 + 4x)e− ↔ (4 + 2x)Fe + 4Li2O(Fe2O3) + 2xLi2O(SnO2)(6) Sn + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixSn (0 ≤ x ≤ 4.4)(5)
The Li insertion–extraction processes of α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays are schematically illustrated in Fig. 4.

Fig. 5a shows the cycling performance curves of the α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays and α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays at a rate of C/10. The capacity of α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays is maintained at 770.9 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. For α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays, the reversible capacity (the second cycle) is 1203.2 mA h g−1, and its coulombic efficiency is 99.6%. For α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays, the second discharge and charge capacities are 893.7 mA h g−1 and 868.9 mA h g−1, respectively. After 50 cycles, its discharge capacity is up to 655.2 mA h g−1 and its coulombic efficiency is 98.4%. The cyclabilities of both α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays and α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays are very high, which could arise from their nanoarray structures. The array structures can provide good contact without any ancillary materials, which can effectively reduce the interfacial resistance.2,7,8,11,14 In addition, the open space between nanorod arrays can offer better accommodation for the volume change in the discharge–charge processes.2,8,14 The good structural features of arrays can easily allow the electrolyte into their inner parts and effectively avoid particle aggregation .2,8,14 As a result, high cyclability can be achieved. It should be pointed out that after 50 cycles α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays have a higher reversible capacity than α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays, which could be attributed to the synergistic effect between nanostructured SnO2 and α-Fe2O3 as discussed above. Typical different rate capability curves are shown in Fig. 5b. At a rate of C/5 in the second cycle, the discharge and charge capacities of α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays are 1138.7 mA h g−1 and 1135.9 mA h g−1. At a rate of 2C, the discharge and charge capacities are maintained at 617.7 mA h g−1 and 612.0 mA h g−1 in the 30th cycle, respectively. When the rate recovers to C/2, the discharge capacity of α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays recovers to 785.5 mA h g−1. The α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod array electrodes show excellent rate capability. Such a high rate capability can also be attributed to the nanoarray structures. Firstly, the nanoarray structures ensure that α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays have good contact with the Ti foil, leading to fast electric transport and excellent electronic conductivity.2,7,8,11,14 Secondly, the open space between the neighbouring nanorod arrays can accommodate the stress of the expansion of the active materials in the Li insertion–extraction processes.2,8,14 Thirdly, electrolyte can easily diffuse into the inner parts of the nanoarray structures, leading to better ion transportation.2,8,14 The high surface-to-volume ratio of the nanoarray structures can facilitate the transport of Li+ and electricity.8 In summary, the highly reversible capacity, excellent cyclability and high rate capacity of α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays support their potential application in the anodes of LIBs, SCPCs and SLPPs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays on titanium foil have been assembled by a facile two-step method without using any soft–hard templates. Excellent lithium storage performances have been achieved. The reversible capacity, cyclability and rate capability are very high. Such high performances can be attributed to the synergistic effect between nanostructured SnO2 and α-Fe2O3 and the nanoarray structures. The present results indicate that α-Fe2O3–SnO2 core–shell nanorod arrays on titanium foil are good candidates for high performance anodes of LIBs.
