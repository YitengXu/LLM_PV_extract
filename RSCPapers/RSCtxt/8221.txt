    , Accepted 5th March 2013First published on 5th March 2013AbstractThe feasibility of renewable acetic acid as a direct fuel of SOFCs for sustainable electric power generation was investigated. To solve the problem of carbon deposition over conventional nickel cermet anodes, an advanced catalyst for acetic acid catalytic decomposition/internal reforming reaction was exploited. A comparative study of coke formation over Ni/Al2O3, Ni/MgO–Al2O3 and Ni–YSZ catalysts was conducted by oxygen-temperature programmed oxidation analysis. We found that the Ni/MgO–Al2O3 catalyst is much superior to the other two catalysts in suppressing carbon deposition, especially under the condition of the presence of steam in the acetic acid fuel. Various cells were fabricated and tested under different conditions. The differences in OCVs and power outputs of the cells caused by the usage of hydrogen and acetic acid as fuels were studied and explained based on the thermodynamic calculation and EIS measurement. After optimization, a peak power density of 1325 mW cm−2 at a furnace temperature of 800 °C was achieved for the cell with a catalyst layer operating on acetic acid fuel. The cell was successfully operated continuously on acetic acid–steam fuel for a period of at least 200 h without any noticeable performance degradation, delamination of the catalyst layer and carbon deposition. The promising results of this work show the possibility of better utilization of the abundant bio-mass or bio-oil for future energy generation.
Introduction
Our current energy infrastructure is predominantly supported by the naturally existing fossil fuels in terms of coal, oil and gas. However, the excessive utilization of these carbon-based fuels has created serious environmental problems of climate change due to the emission of huge amounts of greenhouse gas (CO2), which has exceeded the capacity that can be absorbed by natural processes. In addition, our over-reliance on these dwindling fossil fuels also creates a high risk of a non-sustainable future. Thereby, recently there is increasing interest in exploring carbon-neutral renewable energy,1–10 for example, wind energy, solar energy and bio-energy, which can be replenished naturally. In particular, biomass is believed to be one of the most important next generation energy sources because of its abundance, renewability and easy storage.
Bioethanol, biodiesel and biogas are the most widely applied bio-fuels in our current society.11–17 Bioethanol can typically be produced from crops such as sugar cane, potatoes, manioc and corn, which are also important food resources for human beings or animals. Thereby, there is still a strong debate about how wise it will be to use bioethanol to replace gasoline since humankind still faces food shortage. Although cellulosic ethanol has recently gained increasing importance for the wide availability of cellulose fibers, the ethanol production from cellulosic fibers is much more difficult than that from crops. Similarly, biodiesel also requires crops as the raw materials, thus greatly reducing its attractiveness for practical application. Although biogas can be produced from organic municipal wastes, the fermentation typically requires a long period. These circumstances have convinced us to find better bioenergy sources and better ways to utilize those sources.
Pyrolysis oil is another type of important bio-fuel, which can be generated from a wide range of biomass in the absence of oxygen at high temperatures via a fast pyrolysis process in less than one second.18–25 New developments in fast pyrolysis techniques make possible the oil yields of 70–80% by weight of anhydrous biomass.22,23 The composition of pyrolysis oil is complex and may contain numerous oxygenated organic compounds including acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, phenols and sugars, among which acetic acid is one of the most important compositions with content up to 12%.24,25 Therefore, the study of energy delivery via acetic acid provides a valuable route for the utilization of bio-energy. As compared to petroleum, the storage of acetic acid is much easier due to its more stable and non-flammable properties at room temperature. However, it is a great technological challenge for acetic acid to be used as a fuel in conventional combustion engines. As a new type of high temperature energy-conversion device with high efficiency and fuel flexibility, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) may provide the solution as they can generate considerable power from fuels even with low energy density. For example, CH4–CO2 mixture gas (CO2/CH4 molar ratio = 1.7) has been successfully applied as a fuel of SOFCs, but it is not possible for heat engines.26 Acetic acid as a fuel to sustain the SOFCs for energy delivery has rarely been reported.
Herein, we report a successful and stable operation of SOFCs directly fuelled by acetic acid with surprisingly high power output by applying 17 wt% Ni/MgO–Al2O3 as an anode catalyst layer for internal catalytic decomposition and steam reforming of acetic acid. This introduces a new method for the efficient utilization of abundant biomass as an alternative renewable energy with significant environmental benignity.
Experimental
The composite cathode materials, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF), Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3−δ (SSC) and Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) powders, were synthesized by a combined EDTA–citrate complexing sol–gel method as detailed elsewhere,27 and the electrolyte material (Y2O3)0.1(ZrO2)0.9(YSZ) was purchased from Tosoh (Japan), while the interlayer material SDC was obtained by the hydrothermal synthesis route. 17 wt% Ni/Al2O3 and 17 wt% Ni/MgO–Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized by a glycine nitrite process (GNP),28 and the weight ratio of MgO to Al2O3 was controlled at 15 to 85.
The anode supported cells with the configuration of Ni–YSZ|YSZ|SDC|BSCF (or SSC)–SDC were adopted in this study, and the details of cell fabrication were reported previously.29 Briefly, anode substrates (60 wt% NiO + 40 wt% YSZ) were prepared by the tape casting process, and fired at 1100 °C for 2 h in air. The YSZ electrolyte was deposited onto the anode substrate via a wet powder spraying method. After sintering at 1400 °C for 5 h, SDC slurry was sprayed on the surface of the sintered YSZ electrolyte, and subsequently calcined at 1350 °C for 5 h in air. Finally, the 70 wt% BSCF (or SSC)–30 wt% SDC composite cathode was sprayed over the surface of SDC in a round shape with an effective surface area of 0.48 cm2, and fired at 1000 °C for 2 h in air.
For the SOFC performance test, the cell was mounted onto a quartz tube using silver paste with the cathode side facing the air, while 3% H2O-humidified H2, acetic acid or acetic acid–steam mixture gas with a molar ratio of 1:2 was fed into the anode side as the fuel. The flow rate of H2 was 90 ml min−1 [standard temperature and pressure (STP)]. The liquid acetic acid or acetic acid aqueous solution was vaporized by a water bath at 102 or 82 °C and introduced into the anode chamber by bubbling using nitrogen at a flow rate of 60 or 100 ml min−1 [STP]. I–V and I–P curves of the cells were collected using a Keithley 2420 source meter based on the four-probe configuration. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the cells were obtained using a Solartron 1260A frequency analyzer in combination with a Solartron 1287 potentiostat under OCV conditions from 0.1 to 1000 kHz.
In this study, thermodynamic calculation was applied to predict the equilibrium composition of a nitrogen-diluted acetic acid fuel (acetic acid content of 60 vol%) and an acetic acid–steam mixture at a molar ratio of 1:2 (nitrogen diluted, acetic acid content of 20 vol%) via HSC Chemistry ver. 5.0 software. The system was assumed to be under constant pressure, and the activity coefficient of all components was 1. For oxygen-temperature programmed oxidation (O2-TPO) analysis, approximately 0.02 g of treated powder was placed into a U-shaped quartz tube with an inner diameter of ∼4 mm, and pure oxygen at a flow rate of 20 ml min−1 [STP] was then introduced to the reactor. The deposited carbon on the powder was progressively oxidized into CO2 and analyzed by a Hiden QIC-20 mass spectrometer on line. The microstructure of the fuel cells was examined using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, Quanta-200). The elemental distributions in the anode catalyst layer were analyzed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX).
Results and discussion
Carbon deposition reduction
How to reduce or avoid the coke formation is the first important issue to be considered for the application of carbon-containing fuels for energy delivery as the carbon deposition on anode catalysts can permanently damage the fuel cells by blocking the gas diffusion route, lowering electrochemical activity for fuel oxidation or inducing large internal stress to physically disintegrate the cell components.
The product distribution at thermodynamical equilibrium is closely related to the ratio of carbon to oxygen in the reactant gases and the presence of oxygen in the molecules of acetic acid is favorable to suppressing coke formation. To predict the equilibrium gas composition of acetic acid oxidation, theoretical calculation was carried out in the range of 400–900 °C with results shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen, the major products during the thermal decomposition of acetic acid and steam reforming reactions are H2, CO, CO2, CH4, H2O and C. In the case of nitrogen diluted acetic acid without steam, the H2 and CO concentrations increase with temperature, while other products like CO2, CH4 and H2O show the opposite trend. When the temperature increases to 900 °C, only H2 and CO are produced in the same concentration. The solid carbon is still a preferable product but becomes less favorable at higher operating temperatures (Fig. 1a). From Fig. 1b, we find that the H2 concentration initially increases with temperature up to around 700 °C, and then reduces slightly with the further increase of temperature. It is interesting to note that the change of H2O concentration is exactly in the opposite trend to that of H2. In addition, the CO concentration increases while the CO2 content decreases with the rise of temperature. These phenomena indicate that the reverse water gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O) likely occurs at temperatures higher than 700 °C. The CH4 concentration decreases with increasing temperature, and no methane is produced above 700 °C. From the above theoretical analysis, it is clear that the coke formation can be effectively suppressed by introducing an appropriate amount of water vapor into the fuel gas as solid carbon is no longer observable at 550 °C or higher under the condition of an acetic acid to steam molar ratio of 1:2 as shown in Fig. 1b.
 Fig. 1  Thermodynamically predicted equilibrium product distribution as a function of temperature for (a) nitrogen-diluted acetic acid fuel (acetic acid content of 60 vol%), and (b) a mixture gas fuel of acetic acid and steam at a molar ratio of 1:2 (nitrogen diluted, acetic acid content of 20 vol%) with carbon formation allowed. 
To get experimental information about carbon deposition over conventional nickel cermet anodes operating on acetic acid, a Ni–YSZ cermet anode powder sintered at 1400 °C was treated in a flow of nitrogen–acetic acid mixture gas (acetic acid content of 60 vol%) at 800 °C for 15 min and then subjected for O2-TPO analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, a very large CO2 peak during the progressive increase of temperature was observed, which is due to the oxidation of the deposited carbon over the anode powder. This is not a surprising result as coke formation is a normal phenomenon for SOFCs with a conventional nickel cermet anode when operating on carbon-containing fuels, which is also in good agreement with the thermodynamic calculation. When the Ni–YSZ anode powder was treated in a mixture gas of acetic acid and steam at a molar ratio of 1:2 (nitrogen-diluted, acetic acid content of 20 vol%), a CO2 peak with decreased area was observed in the O2-TPO profile, implying carbon deposition was reduced, but not eliminated completely. Based on the thermodynamic calculation, however, the solid carbon should not be a favorable product under such conditions. One possible reason is that under such a condition of acetic acid with steam, the steam reforming reaction has not reached the equilibrium state due to the insufficient catalytic activity. Thus, it is of critical importance to develop alternative and better anode catalysts with improved activity and coking resistance for operating on acetic acid fuel.
 Fig. 2  O2-TPO profiles of Ni–YSZ (A and A′), 17 wt% Ni/Al2O3 (B and B′) and 17 wt% Ni/MgO–Al2O3 (C and C′) catalysts after treatment in the acetic acid (A, B and C) or acetic acid–steam mixture gas (A′, B′ and C′) for 15 min at 800 °C, respectively. 
One facile way to improve the coking resistance of SOFCs is to modify conventional nickel-cermet anodes with a thin catalyst layer possessing high catalytic activity towards fuel reforming/partial oxidation as well as superior coking resistance.30–32 For example, Zhan and Barnett have applied a Ru/CeO2 catalyst as the anode catalyst layer of a SOFC operating on butane fuel with very inspiring results.31 Our previous results demonstrated that, compared to the Ru/CeO2 catalyst, Ni/Al2O3 possesses equivalent activity, but is more favorable to be applied as the anode catalyst because of its better compatibility with nickel cermet anodes and significantly reduced material cost for preparation.32 Therefore, in this work, nickel-based catalysts (17 wt% Ni/Al2O3 or 17 wt% Ni/MgO–Al2O3) have been applied as the anode catalyst layers to improve the fuel oxidation rate and the coking resistance of the fuel cells.
To comparatively examine the coking resistance of both catalysts (17 wt% Ni/Al2O3 or 17 wt% Ni/MgO–Al2O3), they were treated in the nitrogen-diluted acetic acid or acetic acid–steam mixture gas, similar to the treatment of the blank Ni–YSZ cermet anode powder previously. As can be seen in Fig. 2, a CO2 peak appeared in the O2-TPO profiles of both samples treated in a nitrogen-diluted acetic acid atmosphere, suggesting the coke formation over the catalysts after the treatment. However, compared to the blank Ni–YSZ anode, their peak intensity was much lower, in particular for the catalyst of 17 wt% Ni/MgO–Al2O3. As predicted by the theoretical calculation, when water vapor was introduced into acetic acid, the CO2 peak intensity reduced sharply for both catalysts, as shown in Fig. 2(B′ and C′), indeed, there was almost no CO2 peak detectable in the O2-TPO profiles of 17 wt% Ni/MgO–Al2O3. This indicates that the reaction reached the best thermodynamic equilibrium using the 17 wt% Ni/MgO–Al2O3 catalyst. In other words, 17 wt% Ni/MgO–Al2O3 is a better choice as the anode catalyst for SOFCs operating on acetic acid fuel.
Cell performance
As a concentration cell, the open circuit voltage (OCV) of a SOFC can be determined by the oxygen partial pressure difference between the two electrodes with eqn (1) showing the calculation based on the assumption of no current leaking through the electrolyte.33 The PO2,c and PO2,a are the oxygen partial pressures of the cathode surface and anode surface, respectively. The equilibrium oxygen partial pressure in the acetic acid fuel gas is calculated based on the minimum Gibbs free energy using HSC Chemistry ver. 5.0 software. (1)

Table 1 shows the theoretical OCV of fuel cells when operating on 3% water humidified hydrogen or acetic acid at various temperatures. The theoretical OCV still reaches 1.079 V at 800 °C for the cell operating on acetic acid fuel, just slightly lower than that reached by applying 3% water humidified hydrogen as the fuel (1.102 V). A decrease in OCV with the drop of operating temperature is also observed, which is opposite to the cell applying hydrogen as the fuel. In spite of this, a theoretical OCV up to 1.048 V is still maintained at 600 °C, signifying that acetic acid can be a potential fuel of SOFCs for power generation at intermediate temperatures.

To explore the feasibility of power generation from acetic acid using SOFCs experimentally, we first directly fed a SOFC with acetic acid fuel based on the fuel cell configuration of Ni–YSZ|YSZ|SDC|BSCF–SDC. The cross-sectional SEM image of the cell is shown in Fig. 3. As displayed, the uniform and dense electrolyte (YSZ) layer was sandwiched between the two porous electrode layers of cathode (BSCF–SDC) and anode (Ni–YSZ). The measured thickness of the electrolyte, SDC interlayer (marked by a white line) and cathode is 8, 2 and 25 μm, respectively. More importantly, the different cell components were integrated very well without any peeling-off tendency, guaranteeing the first prerequisite for high cell performance. For comparison purposes, the cell performance was also tested with the fuel of nitrogen-diluted hydrogen (hydrogen content of 60 vol%).

Fig. 4 shows the I–V and I–P polarization curves of the cells at various temperatures. Very high power outputs were obtained when hydrogen was used as the fuel. For example, a peak power density (PPD) of 1877 mW cm−2 was reached at 800 °C; the cell power output still maintained a value up to 556 mW cm−2 at a lower temperature of 600 °C. Such high cell performance was attributed to the very thin layer (8 μm) of the electrolyte and very high electroactivity of the BSCF-based cathode for oxygen reduction.27 When the fuel was switched to nitrogen-diluted acetic acid (60 vol%), the fuel cell still delivered very promising power outputs. As shown in Fig. 4b, PPDs around 1180 and 360 mW cm−2 were obtained when operated at 800 and 600 °C, respectively. These results are highly attractive, considering the relative inertness of acetic acid as compared to hydrogen. Marnellos et al. also used acetic acid as the fuel of the SOFC with Cu-based anodes recently.34,35 However, the detected power densities were very low (only 20 mW cm−2) because of the lower catalytic activity of the Cu-based anode compared to the Ni-based catalyst used in this work. The measured OCVs are slightly lower than the theoretical values. For instance, the measured OCV was 0.962 V at 800 °C in contrast to the theoretically calculated value of 1.079 V. This minor difference can be caused by the dilution effect of feed with nitrogen in the anode chamber. It is noteworthy that a slight increase in OCV with the decrease of operating temperature is demonstrated in Fig. 4b (detailed OCV data shown in Table S1 of ESI†), which is contrary to the thermodynamic calculation reflecting the complexity of the catalytic thermal decomposition of acetic acid.

Acetic acid experienced thermal cracking at the intermediate temperatures; on the other hand, Ni-based anodes can also provide catalytic efficiency to facilitate the decomposition of acetic acid,36 thus the electrochemical oxidation of acetic acid over the fuel cell anode likely followed the indirect way. As schematically shown in Fig. 5, acetic acid was first decomposed to H2 and CO through thermal cracking or under the catalysis of an anode catalyst, and subsequently the H2 and CO produced were oxidized electrochemically to generate electricity. This is the possible reason for a slight increase in OCV at a lower operating temperature. The gas tightness of the SOFC after the cell performance test was confirmed as shown in Fig. S1 and the Video in the ESI.† No any gas leakage was detected, demonstrating the reliability of our robust design of the compacted cell system.
 Fig. 5  Schematic of the SOFC operating principle using acetic acid fuel. 
As mentioned previously, coke formation over Ni-based anodes is a frequently encountered phenomenon for SOFCs using carbon-containing fuels. In order to optimise the anode with improved coking resistance, we applied 17 wt% Ni/MgO–Al2O3 as the anode catalyst layer. As displayed in Fig. 5, the fuel (CH3COOH) would be converted into syngas (H2 + CO) over the catalyst layer before reaching the surface of the nickel cermet anode. In addition, the relatively dense catalyst layer can also perform as a protective layer by providing a physical or product gas barrier to slow down the gas diffusion of the unreacted acetic acid to reach the anode surface.32 Both can help to suppress coke formation over fuel cell anode. Fig. 4c shows the I–V and I–P polarization curves of the cell with the Ni/MgO–Al2O3 catalyst layer operating on the nitrogen-diluted acetic acid. As compared to the cell without the catalyst layer, all the values of OCVs, PPDs as well as the shortened current densities were well improved. For example, the OCVs were 1.012, 1.000, 1.005, 1.010 and 0.993 V at the operation temperatures of 800, 750, 700, 650 and 600 °C, respectively, while the corresponding values were lowered to 0.962, 0.970, 0.978, 0.987 and 1.000 V for the similar cell without the catalyst layer. In addition, the concentration polarization, which normally encounters at high current density, was reduced after applying the anode catalyst layer. Such improved cell performance is obviously due to the introduction of the Ni/MgO–Al2O3 catalyst layer, which provides a better catalytic activity than the Ni–YSZ cermet anode for the catalytic decomposition of acetic acid to syngas (H2 + CO), while H2 has a much higher electrochemical oxidation rate than acetic acid.
To get further information about the cell performance by applying acetic acid fuel, the EIS of the cell operating on hydrogen or acetic acid at various temperatures were collected, and the results in Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 6. The differences between the low frequency and the high frequency intercepts on the real axis correspond to the area specific resistances (ASR) of the electrodes (both anode and cathode), while the intercept of the impedance curve at the high frequency with the real axis represents the ohmic resistance of the whole cell. The ohmic resistance of a single cell actually originates from the electrolyte, electrodes, current collectors and lead wires. Typically the ohmic resistances of the electrodes, current collectors and lead wires are negligible, in particular for the case where mixed conducting oxides were used as the electrode materials in this study. Thus the ohmic resistance can be reasonably considered mainly from the electrolyte, which is directly related to its conductivity. For some electrolytes, the conductivity is affected by the oxygen partial pressure (PO2) of the surrounding atmosphere which varies with different fuels or reaction state of the fuel in the cell system. For example, in doped ceria, the conductivity increased obviously when the PO2 was lower than 10−16 atm at 800 °C.37–39 For the stabilized zirconia electrolyte, as used in this study, however, the ionic conductivity was found to be invariable in a wide PO2 range, even lowering to 10−40 atm at the same temperature of 800 °C. It is noteworthy that, at these conditions, the electronic conductivity alternated with the change in PO2, but its value was always far less than the ionic conductivity at the PO2 range of 1 to 10 × 10-30 atm.40 The equilibrium PO2 is typically larger than 10−25 atm at temperatures higher than 600 °C for the acetic acid fuel, thus the ohmic resistance of the single cell by applying YSZ as the electrolyte should be only determined by the operation temperatures.
 Fig. 6  The EIS of the cell without the catalyst layer operating on (a) hydrogen or (b) acetic acid under OCV conditions. 
Interestingly, although the same cell was applied and operated by hydrogen or acetic acid fuels, the different ohmic resistance of the cell was obtained at the same furnace temperature based on the results in Fig. 6 (the values of ohmic resistances were also given in Table S2 of ESI†). At each corresponding furnace temperature, the ohmic resistances of the cell operating on acetic acid fuel are somewhat larger than those of the cell operating on hydrogen. Such a phenomenon was repeatedly observed previously by applying ammonia as the fuel41 and can be explained by the fact that the endothermic process of ammonia decomposition cooled down the fuel cell in some sense, thus making the real cell temperature lower than that of the furnace. Given the endothermic decomposition of acetic acid (CH3COOH = 2CO + 2H2, ΔH25 °C = 213.761 kJ mol−1 (calculated by HSC Chemistry ver. 5.0 software)), the difference in the ohmic resistance of the cells operating on hydrogen and acetic acid is also likely to be due to the different real cell temperatures. To be consistent with other researchers, here we also assume that the real cell temperatures are the same as the furnace temperatures when hydrogen was applied as the fuel for such a small cell size with a diameter of 15 mm. Then the real cell temperatures for the cell operating on acetic acid can be derived by fitting the ohmic resistance of the cell into the ohmic resistance-temperature dependence line of the cell operating on hydrogen, as shown in Fig. 7. The real cell temperatures reported in Fig. 4b were then found to be around 747, 737, 688, 628 and 540 °C at the furnace temperatures of 800, 750, 700, 650 and 600 °C, respectively.

By adjusting the cell temperatures, the actual PPD of the cell operating on acetic acid was around 1180 mW cm−2 instead of 877 mW cm−2 at a cell temperature of 750 °C, which is still slightly lower than 1670 mW cm−2 for that operating on hydrogen at the same temperature. The difference is probably caused by the catalytic effects of electrodes on the cell performance when operating on different fuels. To get in-depth information about the impact of the different fuel gases on the electrode performance, the EIS of the cell was further analyzed. In the EIS of a symmetric cell, the semicircle in the high frequency range is usually associated with the charge transfer process, and the impedance arc in the high-to-intermediate frequency range is related to the surface diffusion process, while the low frequency arc can originate from the constricted gas diffusion or slow chemical reaction. For a single cell, the impedance spectroscopy is much more complicated since both the anode and cathode will contribute to the impedance, which is overlapped. Anyway, the electrode impedance contributed from the cathode was independent of the fuel gas since the same cell with a thick anode (∼1 mm) and thin cathode (∼25 μm) was applied for the operation on hydrogen and acetic acid fuels in this study, so the difference in impedance spectroscopy should be mainly due to the anode. At the high temperatures for operating on both fuels, a big impedance arc in the intermediate frequency range was observed, suggesting the appearance of serious concentration polarization or reaction polarization from the anode. With the decrease of operation temperature, such polarization became less significant. The appearance of the concentration polarization even under the hydrogen atmosphere is likely due to the presence of nitrogen in the fuel gas. The impedance arc at low frequency became less stable with increased scattering of the data points when operating on acetic acid fuel. Actually the data points at the low frequency still did not approach the real axis at the real cell temperature of 750 °C, reflecting the increased polarization resistance for the gas diffusion/reaction. This is easy to follow because of the slow reaction rate for the catalytic decomposition of acetic acid. However, the increase in impedance is not so significant, suggesting that the acetic acid reaction over the anode is still affordable under such conditions. In order to further reduce the operation temperature, it is critical to improve the fabrication technique to increase the anode porosity and to develop a more efficient anode for acetic acid decomposition/steam reforming. This may explain the further improved cell performance by adopting the 17 wt% Ni/MgO–Al2O3 as the anode catalyst layer, as shown in Fig. 4c, as compared to the conventional cell operating on acetic acid fuel (Fig. 4b).
The long-term operation stability is a big concern for the cell operating on carbon-containing fuels. Fig. 8 shows the operation stability of the cell with a 17 wt% Ni/MgO–Al2O3 catalyst layer using acetic acid–steam mixture gas (1:2 molar ratio) as the fuel at a constant polarization current of 96 mA at a furnace temperature of 800 °C for a period of 200 h; meanwhile, the acetic acid aqueous solution in the bottle was refilled several times to supply the sufficient fuel for operation. As a whole, the cell voltage was maintained very well at 0.72 V within the tested period, although a slight variation of around 0.02 V in the short time was indeed observed, probably caused by the temperature variation. After operating for 200 h, the test was mandatorily stopped to detect the carbon deposition. No carbon deposition was observed at all over the quartz tube reactor after the 200 h test as shown in the inset of Fig. 8. The cell after the stability test was also examined by SEM-EDX. There was also not any carbon deposition over the anode catalyst layer, as shown in Fig. 9. From the cross-sectional view in Fig. 10, it can be identified that the anode catalyst layer was still integrated very well with the anode substrate without any sign of peeling off after the long-term operation.

Conclusions
In short, by modifying a conventional nickel cermet anode-supported thin film electrolyte SOFC with a Ni/MgO–Al2O3 anode catalyst layer, acetic acid can be successfully applied as a direct fuel of SOFCs to generate electricity with very high power output. For example, the peak power output of 1325 mW cm−2 was achieved at the real cell temperature of around 750 °C. Theoretical calculation and experimental tests both confirmed that coking-free operation can be realized by the introduction of water vapour inside the acetic acid fuel gas. The success in suppressing the coke formation is because the adoption of the catalyst layer effectively promoted the acetic acid decomposition and reforming reactions to approach thermodynamic equilibrium. The cell was successfully operated for a period of around 200 h without any performance degradation and microstructure deterioration. As one major composition of the abundant biomass or bio-oil, acetic acid can be directly used as an efficient fuel to generate electricity via the SOFC technology. It may be a promising alternative technique for efficient power generation for the future with great environmental benignity and excellent sustainability.
