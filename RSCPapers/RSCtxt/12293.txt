    , Accepted 27th March 2021First published on 27th March 2021AbstractPoly(L-lactide) (PLA)/TiO2/Pt composite fiber membrane with an internal porous channel structure was fabricated by skillfully tuning the breath figure mechanism and vapor-induced phase separation mechanism with solute and solvent matching via one-step electrospinning and applied in photocatalytic hydrogen production for the first time. The unique structure enhances the light absorption ability of the composite fiber and endows it with excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. The hydrogen production efficiency of functional TiO2 particles loaded on the composite was increased 30 times compared with the efficiency of TiO2 particles in the aqueous solution, thus leading to 1.8 times increase in the hydrogen production capability and 5.8 times increase in the quantum efficiency compared with that of the TiO2/Pt control sample. The composite fiber membrane was further assembled into an ultrathin (1.5 mm) and degradable hydrogen energy generator with a high power density of 47 W m−2 and a high UV luminous energy conversion rate of 92.8% under simulated sunlight.
Introduction
Energy supply is a great challenge for the whole world. Hydrogen (H2) is a kind of new energy source with an extremely high potential because of its high energy density and pollution-free nature.1,2 Currently, industrial hydrogen production routes, including coal to hydrogen and natural gas to hydrogen, still rely on fossil energy essentially, which also causes environmental issues. However, luminous energy can be directly converted into chemical energy and stored in hydrogen without any pollution through the photocatalytic splitting of water using semiconductor materials.3,4 Thus, various technologies of photocatalytic hydrogen production have been a hot topic among the studies on new energy sources.5,6
Semiconductor TiO2 is widely used in photocatalytic contaminant degradation7 or the production of chemicals, including hydrogen8,9 owing to its excellent photocatalytic property.10,11 Normally, TiO2 is required to be modified by methods such as noble metal deposition,12,13 non-metal ion doping,14,15 and dye sensitization,16,17 or by compositing with other semiconductors18,19 to enhance its photocatalytic performance. For instance, depositing a minute amount of noble metal Pt can greatly improve the hydrogen production performance. Photoelectrons generated in TiO2 migrate to Pt, thus preventing the recombination of generated electrons and holes. Moreover, as the active site of photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction, Pt can also reduce the reaction potential and facilitate the reaction prominently.20,21
The utilization of polymer substrates as carriers can prevent the photocatalytic failure that is caused by nanoparticle agglomeration or sedimentation in an aqueous system and is also helpful for the separation and recycling of these expensive nano-functional materials after the reaction.22,23 Besides, such a strategy can endow the composite with some unique characteristics from the polymer substrates.24–26 As a bio-based renewable and degradable environment-friendly material, poly(L-lactide) (PLA) is extensively applied in packaging, textile, and medical care.27 The composite material obtained by loading TiO2 on the PLA substrate combines the advantages of both materials. However, a vast majority of previous studies on the PLA/TiO2 composite focus on antibacterial properties28–33 and application in the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants.34–38
For the PLA/TiO2 composite, owing to the tendency of the TiO2 nanoparticles to agglomerate in the PLA substrate,39 the surface treatment or chemical modification of TiO2 is required to ensure that TiO2 nanoparticles can be well dispersed, which results in multi-step preparation and a complex fabrication process.40–43 In addition, we note that there is currently no report on the application of the PLA/TiO2 composites for photocatalytic hydrogen production. In the field of photocatalytic hydrogen generation, major efforts have been undertaken to improve the photocatalytic performance of the photocatalytic materials themselves and these materials are generally tested under experimental environment instead of being assembled into practical devices,44–46 which clearly shows that there is still a long way to go before the industrial large-scale practical applications.
Electrospinning is an effective fabrication method for porous fibers, in which the breath figures (BF) mechanism can be adapted to fabricate porous structures on the fiber surface47–49 and vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) mechanism can be employed to fabricate porous structures inside the fiber.50,51 In this work, by innovatively combining the two mechanisms and skillfully matching the solutes with the solvents, composite PLA fiber membranes with porous channel structure extending from the surface to the inside of the fibers were prepared by one-step electrospinning and TiO2 nanoparticles without any modification or pretreatment were synchronously loaded on the premise of ensuring dispersion. It was also the first time that the PLA/TiO2 composite was used for photocatalytic hydrogen production to the best of our knowledge.
In the fabricated porous composite fiber membranes, the photocatalytic functional material TiO2 can be loaded on the composite in the premise of proper dispersion, and invalid transmission light can be reduced and more light energy can be utilized. Besides, the unique porous structure enhances the absorption and utilization of light, which can also significantly enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen generation efficiency of the functional materials, thus allowing to achieve a high quantum efficiency and a high hydrogen production capability of the hydrogen generation system with a small number of functional materials. The porous composite fiber membrane is further assembled into an ultrathin and degradable hydrogen energy generator with a high power density and an energy conversion rate under simulated sunlight. The PLA fiber substrate endows the generator flexibility and degradability. The photocatalytic functional materials in the porous composite fiber membranes can be easily recycled and reused. Such a novel, ingenious, simple, and effective strategy can be easily applied to other photocatalytic functional semiconductor nanomaterials and shows a massive prospect, thus providing a feasible solution for industrial large-scale preparation and the application of photocatalytic hydrogen production materials and devices.
Discussion
According to the weight fraction of TiO2 in the total mass of PLA and TiO2, the prepared porous composite fiber membranes with 2 wt%, 4 wt%, 6 wt%, and 8 wt% of TiO2 were marked as PT1, PT2, PT3, and PT4, respectively. The fabrication process of the composite fiber membrane by electrospinning and the formation mechanism of the internal porous channel structure in the fibers by the utilization of the volatilization rate difference of the solvents are shown in Fig. 1. According to the BF mechanism of electrospinning, the solvent needs to be volatile and hydrophobic to fabricate a porous structure on the surface of the fibers.47,48 Here, we chose DCM as it can dissolve PLA well. Besides, according to the VIPS mechanism, a non-volatile and hydrophilic solvent can be adopted to fabricate porous structures inside the fibers.50,51 Hence, we chose DMF because in which TiO2 can be well dispersed. Before electrospinning, PLA was dissolved in DCM and TiO2 was dispersed in DMF. As DCM and DMF are mutually soluble, PLA in DCM and TiO2 in DMF formed a homogeneous mixture. Meanwhile, a large difference in the volatilization rate between DCM and DMF exists. According to Fig. S1,† the saturated vapor pressure of DCM is 120 times higher than that of DMF at 25 °C. When the jet mixture is ejected from the spinneret nozzle of the spinning machine, DCM rapidly volatilizes and PLA dissolved in DCM starts to solidify to form the fiber surface. Meanwhile, the jet mixture absorbs a large amount of heat during the volatilization of DCM and water vapor in the air condenses to the surface of the mixture, thus forming water droplets that can take up some space on the surface of the jet mixture. The space eventually forms pores on the surface of the electrospun fibers. Later, DCM continues to volatilize at a much higher speed than DMF, and the volume of the mixed solution gradually decreases and contracts towards the center of the fibers, and the relatively increased amount of hydrophilic DMF in the DCM/DMF mixed solution in the center of the fibers also attracts the water droplets to migrate with the contraction of the mixed solution. As these processes are synchronized with the solidification of PLA, after completing the volatilization of water droplets, porous fibers are generated due to the migration tracks of water droplets in the fibers. The space occupied by these tracks enables the pores on the surface of the fibers to extend towards the center, thereby eventually forming the internal porous channel structure in the fibers. When the mixed solution contracts, DMF, which volatilizes more slowly, would coat on the fiber after the solidification of PLA. After DMF volatilizes completely, TiO2 particles originally dispersed in DMF are then loaded onto the PLA fiber surface. Finally, the PLA/TiO2 composite fibers were soaked in the H2PtCl6·6H2O solution and Pt is loaded on TiO2 through in situ photo deposition to obtain the PLA/TiO2/Pt composite fiber.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the porous channel structure formation process. 
The morphologies of the fabricated PLA/TiO2/Pt composite fiber are shown in Fig. 2A–H, with Fig. 2A–D for the surface morphologies and Fig. 2E–H for the cross-section (internal) morphologies of PT1, PT2, PT3, and PT4, respectively. The holes on the surface of the PLA fibers and the internal channels connecting with the surface holes can be clearly seen. To further verify that the formation of the particular structure is caused by the volatilization rate difference of the solvents, we replaced DMF with HFIP whose volatilization rate is closer to that of DCM, according to Fig. S1.† When all other experimental conditions remain unchanged, smooth and solid fibers (marked as sample PLA-S) are obtained, as expected (Fig. 2L), which also verifies the assumptions in Fig. 1. To figure out whether the internal porous channel structure can be repeatedly fabricated, we repeated the preparation of PT2 several times. From the SEM images of the cross-section of the composite fiber membranes, as shown in Fig. 2F and S2,† one can see that uniform and very similar internal porous channel structures can be obtained easily. It also indicated that the preparation method is effective and repeatable, and with accurately controlled preparation conditions during electrostatic spinning, a uniform internal porous channel structure can be fabricated repeatedly. Owing to the amount of TiO2 being small in PT1 and PT2, TiO2 particles cannot be clearly seen in the images of PT1 and PT2; thus, element scanning mapping was performed on PT1 (Fig. 2I–K), which has the minimum amount of TiO2 as an example to figure out the existence of TiO2 particles on these composite fibers. The strong signal of Ti on both the surface and cross-section of the fibers clearly shows that TiO2 particles exist and disperse well in the entire fiber without obvious aggregation. As the amount of TiO2 particles increases, a small amount of TiO2 aggregates with tiny sizes can be seen on the surface and cross-section of PT3, and the size of the aggregates obviously increases on the surface and cross-section of PT4 but is still quite small. When further increasing the amount of TiO2 particles, TiO2 particles cannot disperse well in DMF and the particles will embed on the surface of the fibers and eventually form larger aggregates, as shown in Fig. S3A.† Similar large aggregates can also be seen in the composite fibers when DMF is replaced by HFIP and the amount of TiO2 is only 2 wt% (Fig. S3B†). To prove that Pt was deposited on the surface of TiO2 and not on the surface of the PLA matrix, the TEM images of the cross-section of PT2 were taken. As shown in Fig. S4A,† the PLA matrix was totally degraded because of the high voltage electron irradiation of 200 kV during the TEM test, and TiO2–Pt nanoparticles dropped out from the matrix and aggregated to a certain extent but some internal channel structure can still be seen. In the enlarged images shown in Fig. S4B and C,† the black dots can be proved to be the deposited Pt nanoparticles through lattice spacing according to Fig. S4C.† If some Pt nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of the PLA fibers, when the PLA fibers were degraded, these Pt nanoparticles should be in the free state and appeared in the background of Fig. S4B† but we could not see any Pt nanoparticles in the background. On the contrary, we can clearly see that all the Pt nanoparticles were on the surface of TiO2. This can be a definite evidence to prove that Pt can only be deposited on the surface of TiO2 and not on the PLA fibers. In addition, according to the mechanism of the photo-reduction method, only TiO2 can offer the photo-generated electrons to reduce Pt4+ to form Pt.

The components of the PLA/TiO2/Pt composite fiber membranes are characterized more comprehensively. According to Fig. 3A and B, the characteristic peak of TiO2 can be observed in all the composite fiber membranes, indicating that TiO2 has been successfully loaded onto the fiber. As the amount of TiO2 increases, the signal of the peak becomes stronger. To further determine the content of TiO2 in the composite fiber membranes, TGA tests were conducted. The test results are shown in Fig. 3C and D. The content of TiO2 and its addition amount in PT1, PT2, and PT3 shows a linear relation; however, the content of TiO2 is significantly lower than the additional amount in PT4, which is possibly caused by the partial detachment of the TiO2 aggregates. The microelement Pt in the composites was characterized through ICP-MS and the test results are shown in Table 1. The weight fraction of Pt to TiO2 in all the composites is close to 1%, which is consistent with our experimental design. It also indicates that in situ photo deposition can effectively load a certain mass of Pt on TiO2 in this case. As the in situ photo deposition is an interfacial reaction, these results also indirectly show that a majority of TiO2 particles in the composites exist on the outside and inside the surface of the PLA fibers.

The porous channel structure of the composite fiber will lead to a larger specific surface area. The specific surface area is compared between the porous composite fiber with the smooth solid fiber (PLA-S) and aqueous TiO2 aggregate with the same mass as that of the composite in Fig. 4B. The specific surface areas of the fibers was obtained through the nitrogen adsorption test and the specific surface areas of the aqueous TiO2 aggregates was calculated by the size of the aggregate from multiple lights scattering (MLS) test, which can characterize the size of the particle in a liquid environment.52

(B) The specific surface area of the composite fiber membranes, PLA fiber membrane, smooth solid fiber control sample, and aqueous TiO2 aggregate with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1.

(E) UV-Vis spectra of the composite fiber membranes, PLA fiber membrane, and smooth solid fiber control sample. (F) Light energy adsorption in internal channel structure analog computation by FDTD Solutions; different colors represent different light intensity percentage of initial pulse light. 
As shown in Fig. S5,† the size of a single TiO2 particle is just about 20 nm but, as shown in Fig. 4A, TiO2 exists in the solution in the form of micron-sized aggregates and the larger the particle concentration, the larger the size of the aggregates. As shown in Fig. S6,† the calculated specific surface area of the TiO2 aggregates shows that when TiO2 with the same mass as that of the composite is added and forms 0.5 mg mL−1 TiO2 reaction solution, the specific surface area of TiO2 aggregate is only 0.958 m2 g−1; thus, the PLA porous fiber can increase the specific surface area by about 17 times, which is higher than 16 m2 g−1 for the TiO2 aggregates in aqueous solution. Besides, the specific surface areas of the porous composite fiber samples with different content of TiO2 is not significantly different, indicating that the effect of TiO2 aggregation on the specific surface area of the composite fibers can be neglected and the TiO2 particles disperse well and do not form large aggregates. Compared with the smooth solid fiber, the porous channel structure of the composite fiber also increases the specific surface area by about 5 times.
Mercury injection test was further conducted to characterize the pore diameter of the porous channel structures in the fibers (Fig. 4C). When the pressure is low, the mercury injected increases as the pressure increases and gradually fills the space between the fibers. Later, a plateau region appears and the mercury injected remains unchanged even though the pressure increases, indicating that the fibers are condensed under pressure. But when the pressure reaches a critical value, the mercury injected suddenly increases, further indicating that the mercury is pressed into the internal porous channel structure from the surface to the center of the fibers. As the pressure and pore size are specifically correlated with the test (Fig. S7†), we could use the critical value of pressure to estimate that the pore and channel size of the fiber was about 678 nm.
The absorptivity of the fiber membranes to light of different wavelengths was tested and the results are shown in Fig. 4E. It can be seen that the smooth and solid fiber membrane shows quite a low absorptivity to ultraviolet and visible light, indicating that the light adsorption ability of PLA itself is weak. However, the absorptivity of the porous fiber membrane to ultraviolet and visible light significantly increases. We believe that it is caused by the multiple reflection and absorption of light in the porous channels inside the fiber after the light runs through (Fig. 4D).
It is also noticed that the size of internal channels in the fibers is close to the wavelength of the UV-Visible light, which means that quite a strong diffraction will happen when the light is running through. In order to figure out whether such a narrow channel can further increase the absorptivity of light, we used FDTD solutions to undertake analog computation of light energy adsorption in the internal channel structure. Pulse light with a wavelength of 500 nm is running through two channels with two different sizes, one is 500 nm to simulate the channel in our fibers and another is 2 μm, as a comparison. As the results are shown in Fig. 4F, the light intensity of the wave crest decreases obviously in the 500 nm channel, while the light intensity of the wave crest almost stays the same in the 2 μm channel, indicating that the narrow channel with a size close to the wavelength of light can enhance the absorptivity of light, which we believe is caused by the stronger diffraction effect that warps the spreading of light, and more light energy is diffused and adsorbed by the channel wall material.
In addition, as TiO2 can absorb ultraviolet light, the composite fiber membranes containing TiO2 show that the significant absorption of the ultraviolet light of the wavelength is less than 400 nm and the adsorption increases with the increase in the content of TiO2. By integrating the curves in the ultraviolet range in Fig. 4E, we obtained the average absorptivity of all the samples to all bands of ultraviolet light, as shown in Fig. S8.† It can be seen that the absorption ability of the porous fiber membranes is higher than that of the smooth and solid fiber membranes, which directly affects the photocatalytic performance, and the porous composite fiber membranes loaded with TiO2 show further improved absorption ability of ultraviolet light.
The photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of the composite fiber membrane was examined. The membranes with a thickness of about 0.3 mm were cut into 30 × 30 mm square samples with a controlled mass of (50 ± 2) mg for each test. Meanwhile, 50 mg TiO2 powder with the same mass as that of the composite fiber membranes was dispersed in 100 mL water as a control (Fig. 5A). The original data of the test process are shown in Fig. 5B and the results are shown in Fig. 5C. Since the data of TiO2 (orange line) and PLA (purple line) are too close in Fig. 5B and cannot be discriminated easily, we put them separately in Fig. S9† with a smaller ordinate to show the difference clearly. In the test, the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of the PLA/TiO2/Pt composite determined the hydrogen production capability of the entire aqueous reaction system. It can be seen that the PLA fiber membrane without the loading of TiO2 does not exhibit any photocatalytic hydrogen production performance and TiO2 without the loading of Pt only exhibits limited photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. As shown in Fig. S10A,† after loading Pt, the composite exhibits lower PL intensity, which reflects a lower recombination rate of the photo-generated charges. Through data fitting, as shown in Fig. S10B,† it can be found that the lifetime of the photo-generated charges in the composite becomes longer. Both the mechanisms positively contribute to the improvement of photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of the composites. The hydrogen production performance of PT1 is lower than that of the control group TiO2–Pt (1 wt%) because the amount of TiO2 is too small in PT1, with only 1.96 wt%. However, the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of PT2 with a higher content of TiO2 (4.18 wt%) is greatly improved and is higher than that of TiO2–Pt, and that of PT3 and PT4 with even a higher content of TiO2 (5.83%, 6.86%) is almost doubled compared with that of TiO2–Pt. The photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of PT4 increases less significantly than that of PT3, possibly because that TiO2 in PT4 has already started to aggregate. It should be noted that despite PT3 and PT4 contain relatively much more TiO2, the contents of TiO2 as the photocatalytic functional material are still less than 7 wt%. However, all masses of TiO2–Pt in the control group consist of photocatalytic functional materials.

(F) Photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of the PLA/TiO2/Pt porous composite fiber membrane compared with the literature reports.20,53–61 
It is worth noting that all of hydrogen is generated from the functional material TiO2/Pt instead of the PLA substrate. To independently demonstrate the difference in the efficiency of the functional materials, the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of the functional materials with average unit mass was calculated and compared in Fig. 5E. We also tested the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of TiO2 in an aqueous reaction system with different concentrations, whose aggregates' size and specific surface area have been already discussed, to help understand and the results are shown in Fig. S11.† It can be seen that from the 0.1 mg mL−1 sample to the 2.0 mg mL−1 sample, the specific surface area decreases by 1.89 times (Fig. S11A†), and the hydrogen generation efficiency of the sample decreases by 1.96 times (Fig. S11B†), very close to 1.89 times, which indicates that the aggregation of the functional material has a strong negative impact on the hydrogen generation efficiency. On the contrary, good dispersion can significantly improve the hydrogen generation efficiency of functional materials. The photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of functional materials in PT1, PT2, and PT3 increases by about 30 times compared with that of TiO2–Pt. Though the efficiency of the functional materials in PT4 declines slightly owing to the aggregation of TiO2 particles, it is still 26 times more than that of TiO2–Pt, indicating that TiO2 is highly dispersed in the PLA fiber substrate in the PLA/TiO2/Pt composite fiber membranes and shows excellent performance. But, as shown in Fig. 4A, the specific surface area of the porous composite fibers is 17 times than greater than that of TiO2–Pt, and less than 20 times; thus, the nearly 30 times increase in the hydrogen generation efficiency must also be due to the internal porous channel structure of the composite fiber, which enhances the absorption of light and then further increases the performance of the functional material. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) of each sample at a wavelength of 365 nm was calculated based on the following equation.  where R is the moles of hydrogen generated in unit time, N is Avogadro's number, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, E is the optical power density, S is the lighting area, and λ stands for the wavelength of light.
High apparent quantum efficiency requires functional materials in the reaction system to capture as much light running through the reaction solution as possible, while in a typical reaction system, the nanoparticles of functional materials are distributed in the entire solution, and due to the huge gaps between them, a majority of light directly runs through the blank solution without being absorbed or used by any particle. As a result, the quantum efficiency of the reaction system is greatly reduced, while simply increasing the concentration of the nanoparticles to fill these gaps leads to serious aggregations. However, as shown in Fig. 5D, the quantum efficiency of all the porous composite fiber samples is higher than that of the TiO2–Pt control group, and significantly increases from PT1 to PT3, which is nearly 6 times than that of TiO2–Pt, indicating that when TiO2 particles are loaded on the PLA porous fiber substrate, the photocatalytic functional materials can be loaded on the composite as many times as possible in the premise of proper dispersion, and the invalid transmission light can be reduced and more light energy can be utilized. In addition, the enhanced hydrogen generation efficiency of the functional materials also makes a contribution to the increasing energy conversion efficiency of the entire reaction system. In Fig. 5F, we compare the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of the PLA/TiO2/Pt porous composite fiber membrane with other TiO2-based photocatalytic composites from previous reports. The noble metal dopant concentration in the composite fiber (0.055 wt% of Pt, from Table 1) is lower than all the mentioned reports but the composite fiber demonstrates excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production performance, which is superior to most of the previous reports.
Finally, we further assembled PT3 into a 30 × 30 × 1.5 mm model photocatalytic hydrogen energy generator to demonstrate the practical application of the porous composite fiber membranes. The typical structure of the generator is shown in Fig. 6A. Aluminum foil with good reflectivity was used as the bottom plat, and the porous composite fiber membrane was then covered on the aluminum foil and surrounded by a frame made from silica gel. The uppermost layer was a PET membrane with excellent light-admitting quality as the top plate. The demonstration of the reflectivity rate of aluminum foils and the light transmittance quality of the PET membrane are shown in Fig. S12.† The generator was connected to a gas channel after it was bonded and then all the gaps were sealed with silicone grease. The hydrogen produced could be restored for further utilization or be directly connected with a hydrogen cell to convert into electric energy for power supply to electrical appliances (Fig. 6D). The real product of composite fiber membrane is shown in Fig. 6B and the real product of the assembled hydrogen energy generator is shown in Fig. 6C. The performance of the generator was tested under simulated sunlight with an optical power density of 100 mW cm−2, which was provided by a xenon lamp and an AM 1.5 solar simulator, and aggregated hydrogen bubbles could be seen after the generator was illuminated for a while. The test was continued for 3 h and the results are shown in Fig. 6E. 38.88 mL hydrogen was collected in total, i.e., 14.4 L h−1 m−2. The maximum output power and power density of the generator could be calculated, which are 42 Mw and 47 W m−2, respectively. The rated power of the air fan in Fig. 6D is just 10.4 mW, far less than the 42 mW maximum output power of the generator; thus, it can be easily supplied. As shown in Fig. 6F, during the 3 h test, 9720 J simulated sunlight energy was offered by the xenon lamp and 5% energy of sunlight belongs to the ultraviolet (UV) light, which means that 486 J UV luminous energy had passed the generator. Finally, 451 J of the 486 J was converted into chemical energy according to the generated volume of hydrogen, with a 92.8% energy conversion rate, illustrating that the capture of UV luminous energy by the generator is highly effective. The cycle test was conducted to characterize the stability of the generator and the test results in Fig. 6G show that the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of the generator does not significantly decline and basically remains stable after an 18 h reaction for 6 cycles. Back to Fig. 6A, in the practical application situation, the generator can be used as an array to provide more power. For example, a generator array with an area of 30 m2 on the rooftop can provide as much as 30.5 MJ (8.5 kW h) power only through 6 h illumination in the daytime, which is enough for the daily power demand of an ordinary family. Extra hydrogen can be stored in an underground gasholder in the daytime and used at night after sunset since due to the high power density of hydrogen, it will not take too much space to store this extra hydrogen.

(C) Real product of the assembled hydrogen energy generator and the aggregate hydrogen bubbles in the generator during working. (D) Fuel cell and electric appliance. Photocatalytic hydrogen production test (E), energy conversion rate (F), and cycling stability test (G) of the photocatalytic hydrogen energy generator. 
As the whole generator is constructed with flexible materials, it is applicable to be attached to rooftop, wall, and other surfaces, and it can sustainably convert solar energy into chemical energy. Furthermore, as PLA is a degradable material, if ultraviolet light is used for the composite fiber and the sacrificial agent is not added, the PLA substrate can be degraded by the strongly oxidized photogenerated holes produced by TiO2, and the photocatalytic functional material TiO2 can be recycled and reused in the same way after the PLA substrate is degraded. Thus, the performance of the composite fiber membrane that is newly prepared will not be greatly different from that of the original membrane (Fig. S13†).
Conclusions
In summary, we prepared the PLA/TiO2/Pt porous composite fiber membrane via one-step electrospinning and fabricated a complicated porous channel structure inside the fiber by exquisitely using the volatilization rate difference of the solvent during the spinning process. The internal porous channel structure significantly increased the light absorption ability, and the composite fiber membrane demonstrated excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production capability and quantum efficiency, which were1.8 times and 5.8 times higher than that of the original TiO2–Pt reaction system, respectively. In addition to this, the hydrogen production efficiency of the photocatalytic functional material of the composite fiber membrane was about 30 times higher than the original TiO2–Pt reaction system due to the good dispersion of TiO2 on the PLA substrate and the enhanced light absorption ability. The porous composite fiber membrane was further assembled into an ultrathin and degradable hydrogen energy generator with high power density and energy conversion rate to explore the application effect in a more practical situation. Such a novel, ingenious, simple, and effective strategy can be easily applied to other photocatalytic functional semiconductor nanomaterials and shows a massive prospect to provide a feasible solution for industrial large-scale preparation and the application of photocatalytic hydrogen production materials and devices.
Experimental section
Materials
PLA (Mn = 9.1 × 104 g mol−1, Mw = 2.1 × 105 g mol−1, Mw/Mn = 2.3) was provided by Hisun Biomaterials Co. Ltd (Zhejiang, China). The melting temperature of PLA is 180 °C (DSC, 10 °C min−1). TiO2 (P25) with a density of 3.93 g cm−3 and an average particle size of 20 nm was from Degussa Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). Before use, both the PLA pellets and TiO2 powder were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. Dichloromethane (DCM), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O), methyl alcohol, and ethyl alcohol were purchased from Aladdin Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). All the reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification, and distilled water was used for all the experiments.
Fabrication of the PLA/TiO2/Pt porous composite fiber membrane
Firstly, PLA pellets were dissolved in DCM under intense stirring while TiO2 powder was dispersed in DMF with the aid of an ultrasonic bath treatment. Then, the PLA solution and TiO2 suspension were mixed together uniformly under magnetic stirring for 1 h. The concentration of PLA in DCM was 160 g L−1 and the used volume of DMF was a quarter of that of DCM. According to the different weight fractions of TiO2 in the total mass of PLA and TiO2, samples with 2 wt%, 4 wt%, 6 wt%, and 8 wt% of TiO2 were marked as PT1, PT2, PT3, and PT4, respectively. The well-mixed suspensions were subsequently used for electrospinning (ET-2535H Nanosetup, Ucalery, China) to prepare the fiber membranes, under a voltage of 10 kV at the ambient parameters of 25 ± 1 °C and 80 ± 10% RH. The feeding rate of the syringe was 1 mL h−1, and the gap between the tip of the needle and the collector plate was fixed at 15 cm. Before post-treatment, the fiber membranes were vacuum dried at 40 °C for 24 h to completely remove the residual solvent and then annealed at 100 °C for 2 h. The obtained fiber membranes were immersed in the aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O to load Pt on the surface of TiO2 under UV irradiation through in situ photo deposition method62 and finally, the PLA/TiO2/Pt porous composite fiber membranes were obtained. The designed weight fraction of Pt to TiO2 was 1 wt%. For comparison, a porous fiber membrane without adding any TiO2 was prepared under the same conditions and marked as PLA.
Characterizations
The morphology and structure of the samples were characterized with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM 7500F, JEOL, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and a field-emission transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, FEI, USA) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using an X-ray diffractometer (UltimaIV, Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) in the range of diffraction angles 2θ = 5–80° at a scanning speed of 10° min−1 at room temperature. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained over the wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm−1 using an FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet 6700, Nicolet, USA). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA2, MTD, Switzerland) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 30 to 800 °C in an air stream. Microelement content analysis was carried out on an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (VG-PQExCell, TJA, USA). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption test was performed on an adsorption analyzer (Belsorp-Max, Ankersmid, Holland) after pretreatment at 120 °C for 12 h. The optical properties of the samples were tested using an ultraviolet-visible near-infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectrophotometer (UV3600, Shimadzu, Japan). The aggregated size of TiO2 particles in the suspensions was measured with a multiple light scatter (MLS) stability analyzer (Turbiscan AGS, Formulaction, France). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolution photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the samples were studied using a fluorescence spectrometer (F-7000, Hitachi, Japan) with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm.
The photocatalytic hydrogen production performance was characterized using a multichannel photocatalytic water splitting hydrogen production device (RTK-Solar-I, Rocktek, Hubei, China) and the light source was simulated sunlight with an optical power density of 200 mW cm−2 provided by a 300 W photocatalytic xenon lamp (CEL-HXUV300, Au-light, Beijing, China) with an AM 1.5 solar simulator. In the apparent quantum yield (AQY) test, a light filter was used to obtain UV light with a single wavelength of 365 nm. Typically, the prepared sample (Fig. 5A) was added into distilled water with 20% (volume fraction) methyl alcohol as the sacrificial reagent; then, nitrogen was aerated for 30 min to exclude the dissolved oxygen thoroughly before turning on the xenon lamp and starting the test. Each test continued for 180 min and the volume of hydrogen produced was recorded. The reaction system was kept at 25 °C using a thermostatic water-jacket during the test.
