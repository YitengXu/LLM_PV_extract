    First published on 9th May 2023AbstractThe selective methanation of CO2 is an important research area to meet the net-zero emission targets. Furthermore, it is crucial to develop solutions to achieve carbon neutrality, hydrogen utilization, carbon circularity, and chemical-energy storage. This conversion can be realized via the thermocatalytic multistep power-to-X route or by direct electro- (or photoelectro)-catalytic technologies. Herein, we discuss the need to accelerate direct technologies. Improving these technologies requires a better understanding of the catalytic chemistry and the complexity of the aspects to consider in bridging catalytic and electrocatalytic CO2 methanation. In this tutorial review, initially we analyze the fundamental question of the competitive adsorption of key reactants and regulation strategies to promote the overall reaction. Then, this approach is used to guide the reader in understanding the differences between thermocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Finally, the complexity of the aspects necessary to include in modelling and designing next-generation electrocatalysts for CO2 methanation is analyzed.

Introduction
Developing efficient solutions for chemical energy storage and closing the carbon cycle in energy-intensive industries1–3 are among the main challenges in meeting the net-zero emission target (carbon neutrality) established at the governmental level. Therefore, intense research efforts have been devoted to developing technologies that will allow the realization of this objective. In this case, presently, the focus is the power-to-X (PtX) technologies, even reaching pilot-scale development.4–6 Among them, the selective methanation of CO2 is one of the preferential technologies7–11 because methane can be used as a substitute for natural gas. It can be introduced into the current natural gas distribution grid and underground storage system. In addition, methane can conveniently replace fossil fuels in hard-to-abate sectors, not requiring (or minor) changes to the existing systems. Therefore, methane produced from CO2 provides a valuable decarbonization path.
From 1st to 2nd generation CO2 methanation technologies
PtX is a platform powered by excess renewable energy to produce fuels and chemicals from water, air and carbon dioxide. The representative technologies in PtX (Fig. 1) are as follows: (i) electrolysis of water for hydrogen production, (ii) CO2 separation and purification, and (iii) CO2 thermocatalytic conversion (single or multistep) to methanol or other chemicals/fuels, etc.12,13 Electrolysis is the core of PtX to produce green hydrogen. However, the thermal integration of this step with the consecutive thermocatalytic step is complex due to the different dynamics of the process and the operating conditions. In addition, water electrolysis is energy intensive. A critical aspect is the anode reaction of O2 production, which requires a relatively high overpotential and has sluggish kinetics.14–16 Also, the issue of hydrogen storage still needs to be addressed.17 Thus, the energy efficiency of this process is limited to about 70%. Noble metals are also necessary as electrocatalysts.
 Fig. 1  PtX fuel production through water splitting + thermocatalysis (1st generation technology) and direct electrocatalysis (2nd generation). 
Besides, the thermocatalytic step of CO2 methanation, needs to be improved, which is an exothermic reversible reaction. A reaction temperature below 300–320 °C is required to achieve the methane quality necessary to be introduced directly in the methane grid (in terms of residual H2, CO and CO2) due to equilibrium.18,19 However, the catalysts reported in the literature typically do not have sufficient activity to achieve the complete conversion of CO2 (under industrially relevant space velocities) below about 350 °C. Also, their stability under industrial conditions (including the presence of water and possible deactivating agents in the feed) is a further question. Thus, this is still a scientific issue in developing and improving CO2 methanation catalysts.11,20–22
Recent advances regarding the synergy between photo- and thermal catalysis enable low-temperature (<200 °C) CO2 methanation.23–26 However, the reaction rates of around 30 μmol g−1 h−1 are still low.
The PtX process for CO2 methanation has a low overall energy efficiency. However, despite the many attempts, even at the pilot scale, improving its efficiency, thus reducing the process costs is quite challenging. Thus, the general indication is that the costs of producing methane by this PtX route will be challenging to become competitive.27 Accordingly, it is necessary to develop new-generation technology to overcome the intrinsic limitations of the 1st generation PtX CO2 methanation process. There are various reports on the investigation of 2nd generation technologies based on direct electrocatalytic CO2 methanation.28–30
In the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2, hydrogen equivalents (H+/e−) are generated in situ and used to reduce CO2 directly at the cathodic side. The formation of the H2 molecule as an intermediate is avoided, with the following positive aspects: (i) thermodynamic equilibrium limitations are not present and (ii) the loss of energy related to the overpotentials in producing and using the H2 molecule is minimized.
At a potential cost analogous to H2 electrolyzers, a single device can realize direct CO2 conversion, thus integrating the two steps of H2 production and CO2 hydrogenation. Also, operations can be performed under near ambient conditions. Both capital and operative expense costs are potentially lower. Therefore, the direct coupling of these devices with industrial streams containing low concentrations of CO2 can be possible in the future. Presently, gas diffusion electrodes containing elements such as metal–organic-framework (MOF) materials are being investigated. They capture CO2 from diluted streams, concentrating it on the electrocatalyst surface.13,31,32 However, the separation of CO2 may contribute to up to half the cost of CO2 methanation technology. Alternatively, direct electrocatalytic CO2 methanation operates under milder operative conditions than the PtX thermocatalytic process. Artificial-like devices for optimal distributed use can also be realized.33,34 Thus, there are many incentives to accelerate the development of these 2nd generation technologies for CO2 methanation. However, there are many challenges to be solved before implementing these devices.
One of the critical issues is the development of more efficient and stable electrocatalysts, which should have significantly high faradaic efficiency and high current densities (productivity). However, the development of electrocatalysts cannot be disjointed from the improvement of the electrocatalyst device, its operative conditions and industrial scalability.
The relevance of CO2 methanation technologies and the approaches used in designing catalysts for this reaction
The selective methanation of CO2 (Sabatier reaction) is an important research area. It contributes to carbon neutrality and circularity, hydrogen utilization, chemical-energy storage, and meeting the net-zero emission targets. Currently, the focus is on 1st generation PtX thermocatalytic multistep technologies (Fig. 1). In contrast, the 2nd generation direct electro- (or photoelectro)-conversion technologies are less advanced and at a lower technology readiness level. Photothermal direct CO2 methanation is another valuable direction, as cited before. In the previous section, we discussed the need to accelerate the progress in these 2nd generation technologies.
From thermal to electro-catalysis
Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding solid catalysts.35,36 However, it is still a question whether the knowledge and approaches used to develop heterogeneous catalysts can be translated to the design of improved electrocatalysts for 2nd generation technologies. Heat provides the energy to overcome the activation barriers in the reaction on solid heterogeneous catalysis. Alternatively, electrocatalysts typically operate at room temperature, with the reaction power supplied as charges generated by applying an electrical potential. Generally, a double electrical layer is present at the interface between the electrocatalyst and electrolyte, which determines the diffusion of molecules at the surface of electrocatalysts. Also, it influences the surface properties of electrocatalysts. Thus, the paths of transformation and driving forces are different between heterogeneous and electro-catalysis.
To better differentiate between heterogeneous and electrocatalysis, herein, we use the term “thermal” catalysis for the former to discuss the fundamental difference in how the energy for overcoming the activation barrier is provided, as explained above. The term “heterogeneous”, even if it is the most used, may be misleading because also electrocatalysts are solid “heterogeneous” catalysts.
Alternatively, there are certain analogies, and thus the typical approach is to use methods developed for heterogeneous catalysis and apply them to electrocatalysis. Can this methodology account for the intrinsic higher complexity of the latter? This is the fundamental question addressed in this tutorial review.
However, the scope is neither to review the state-of-the-art in thermal or electro-catalysis for CO2 methanation nor to identify the best catalysts or design criteria. Even if this reaction is relevant, as commented above, it is used herein mainly as a valuable example to clarify the complexity of the aspects to account for bridging thermal and electro-catalysis. Most of the elements discussed are general for electrocatalysis. It is worth remembering that many other relevant reactions exist in the area of electrocatalysis, ranging from hydrogen or oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER, respectively) to the conversion of CO2 to other chemicals/fuels, the electrocatalytic reduction of N2 to ammonia and electrocatalytic conversion of various bio-based molecules.37–39
Herein, we only focus on CO2 methanation, mentioning these other reactions only when they provide additional necessary aspects. Similarly, even if photo or photothermal CO2 methanation are worthy directions, we do not discuss them explicitly.
CO2 reduction and the reaction mechanism
Reducing CO2 to CH4 requires an 8-electron process and consists of multiple elementary reactions, including various reaction intermediates. The adsorption of the reactants, intermediates and products on the catalyst surface determines the reaction paths and selectivity. There are usually two crucial aspects to consider, as follows: (i) the adsorption strength and (ii) the molecular orientation. The first determines the reaction rate. The molecular orientation mainly refers to the coordination on the catalyst surface of the reactant or intermediates through the C or O atoms. This aspect determines the reaction path. In addition to the similar reactants (CO2 and H2) and products (CH4, CO, formic, etc.), the intermediates such as chemisorbed formate, carbonyl and CO play essential roles in reducing CO2 to methane.
The adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface is the first step in the transformation path. The bending of the CO2 molecule from its linear equilibrium geometry determines relevant aspects, as follows:
(i) Induces lowering of the in-plane 2πu orbital energy, making the carbon atom electrophilic.
(ii) Facilitates the adsorption of CO2 on metals at the Fermi level of the d-band centre, such as Pt, Cu, and Pd.40
Subsequently, CO2 will react with active H or protons, and electrons to formate, carbonyl, or *CO, where the symbol * indicates a chemisorbed species. The catalyst and reaction conditions determine the reaction pathway because they affect the nature of the active sites for CO2 adsorption and the functional group distribution around chemisorbed CO2. The site geometry before CO2 adsorption determines the formation of the intermediates. Typically, researchers categorize the reaction pathways according to predominant reaction intermediates identified by in situ infrared and AP-XPS methods.41,42
In the case of thermal catalysis, there are three conceivable pathways toward methane synthesis, as follows: (i) formate pathway, (ii) carbide pathway, and (iii) carboxyl pathway (Fig. 2a).
 Fig. 2  Schematic of the possible reaction pathways in catalytic CO2 hydrogenation through (a) thermal and (b) electro-catalytic processes. The same color indicates the same reaction intermediate. 
The oxygen atom adsorbed on the catalyst surface in the formate pathway reacts with activated H atoms to form a formate intermediate. A parallel route is that activated hydrogen combines with oxygen at the metal–oxide interface to generate –OH, while CO2 combines with –OH to generate bicarbonate, further creating formate. The formate will further be hydrogenated to produce methane or methanol or decompose to form CO.43,44 In the carboxyl pathway, a carbon atom adsorbed on the catalyst surface reacts with H* to form carboxyl, which dissociates to generate CO. The third path is carbide, in which CO2 dissociates to *CO and *C, and finally hydrogenated to CH4. Due to thermodynamic constraints, formic acid and methanol products are rarely present at atmospheric pressure, and CO is usually the only by-product under atmospheric conditions.7,8,10
Electrochemical CO2RR in an aqueous environment involves multiple electrons and protons transfer to reduce CO2 into other chemicals. This type of electron/proton transfer cannot occur in thermal catalysis. In addition, the presence of a surface electrical potential, double electrical layer, and electrolyte determines the changes in the transformation paths and reaction intermediates. For example, formate is indicated not the generation of methane.45 The formate intermediate is present in thermocatalysis routes but is further hydrogenated to methane or methanol. Formate in electrocatalysis instead desorbs preferentially in the electrolyte. When carbon atoms are first adsorbed on the catalyst surface, carbonyl groups are preferentially formed, and then the carbonyl groups are dissociated to *CO.46 *CO is the intermediate to methanol, methane or C–C coupling products (C2+), as shown in Fig. 2b. Notably, a high overpotential of 2.5 V is required for methane formation, considerably above the thermodynamic value of about 1.1 V for the CO2RR reaction.
We may distinguish between faradaic efficiency in CO2 reduction versus side HER and carbon faradaic selectivity, e.g., methane formation with respect to competitive products. The onset potential required to generate CO is about 0.53 V (vs. NHE, when pH = 7),47 while that to synthesize hydrocarbons, including C2H4 and CH4, is about −1.2 V (vs. NHE).48 However, although the carbon faradaic selectivity is often high, the competing HER is typically the most crucial issue.
Thus, there are intrinsically different mechanistic aspects between thermal and electro-catalysis due to the following reasons: (i) the different operating reaction conditions, (ii) the presence of an electrolyte and electrical double layer, and (iii) the applied potential. However, the main result of the following discussion is to show that the limiting factors determining the behaviour are significantly different. A consequence of this difference is that the methods used to study the reaction mechanism in thermal catalysis often fail to describe the effective reaction mechanism and identify the proper design criteria for electrocatalysis. This crucial aspect is rarely recognised adequately in the literature. Thus, a central aim of this tutorial review is to provide evidence for it.
Specifically, it is not the scope to discuss the mechanistic aspects of the electrocatalytic reaction beyond the general elements introduced above and later. Even if the issue of selectivity also exists in thermal catalysis, it is more pronounced in electrocatalysis, where (faradaic) selectivity in both the hydrogenation of CO2versus the HER and the type of carbon products exists. In particular, the specific issue of controlling the C1versus C2+ paths products exists, where C2+ indicates products with two or more C atoms. This is a relevant mechanistic feature of CO2 electro-conversion but of minor relevance to the scope of this tutorial. In addition, there are contrasting indications on the factors determining these competitive paths (to C1 or C2+ products).
A series of recent reviews discussed these aspects.49–54 The focus was on copper-based catalysts, which are considered unique in CO2 electroconversion to C2+ products from the initial studies over 30 years ago. The reason for this specificity is explained in different ways. One of them is based on the binding energies of the intermediates (*H and *OCHO, e.g., bound to the surface through O, *COOH, e.g., bound to the surface through C, and *CO) as descriptors for predicting the product distribution in CO2 electroreduction.55 The unique ability of Cu to reduce CO2 to C2+ products is explained by the fact that it is the only metal with a negative adsorption energy for *CO but a positive adsorption energy for *H.52 In general, all mechanistic interpretations on the paths of CO2 electro-conversion are based on indications of the type of surface intermediates, which are stabilized at the different facets of different metals. However, the results in the literature (discussed later) show that a metal such as Pt is essentially inactive in C2+ formation and it can form C2+ with a selectivity of over 60% when enough CO2 surface concentration is induced. Recent results show that hydroxide-derived copper electrodes exhibit excellent performance in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.56 Based on the OH/Cu ratio in the electrode, excellent faradaic efficiencies for CH4 (78%) or C2+ products (71%) are observed. Most mechanistic indications and factors determining the surface path are invalid for these electrocatalysts. Although the complexity of the factors determining the paths in CO2 electroconversion is emerging in many reviews, the focus is still on the electrocatalyst characteristics, such as surface facets and type of Me(hkl) surfaces, while the role of operative conditions (electrolyte and pH) is recognized.52 In the part related to electrocatalysis, we will show that instant transport effects will determine the behaviour. Thus, the combination of reactor/electrode design will be more relevant in determining the paths of transformation and performances rather than the intrinsic characteristics of the catalyst, raising a question about the validity of the mechanistic literature considerations as design factors under industrial relevant electrocatalytic conditions.
Further, selected reviews and papers on the mechanistic aspects of electrocatalytic CO2 methanation are discussed in ref. 57–60.

Impact of CO hydrogenation rate on the selectivity of CO2 reduction. 
CO plays a relevant role in CO2 reduction. CO is the primary side reaction in thermal catalysis, not electrocatalysis. A too weak adsorption strength of CO will lead to gas-phase CO formation. Three pathways can generate CO, i.e., *CO and *OH are formed by carbonyl decomposition through the carboxyl pathway.43,44,61 In the carbide path, CO2 is adsorbed on the oxygen vacancy to obtain *CO and *O. *CO and *OH can also be generated in the formate route by formate decomposition.62 Given that the dissociation of formate to *CO requires overcoming a significant energy barrier, the RWGS (reverse water–gas shift reaction) has two reaction paths, i.e., carboxyl and carbide. During the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to methane, *CO may dissociate, generating *C, which can be hydrogenated to methane or C2+ hydrocarbons. This path requires that the catalyst has sufficient affinity for O.
The C and O atoms in *CO can react with *H to form *CHO and *COH intermediates in the carbonyl route, respectively. Grabow and Mavrikakis63 indicated that *COH is intermediate to methanol. They calculated the energy barriers formed by the C–H bond and O–H bond on the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst using the density-functional theory (DFT) method, which are 0.24 eV and 1.17 eV, respectively.
The adsorption strength of *CO also determines the selectivity of electrocatalytic CO2RR. Liu et al.64 reported a decrease in methane and methanol selectivity for an Fe single-atom catalyst due to CO desorption. This occurs when the adsorption energy of *CO falls below −0.88 eV. In addition, *CO continues to react, generating *COH or *CHO intermediates, which require enough protons to attack the C atom or O atom in *CO. This implies a sufficient adsorption strength for both *CO and H*,65 which is used to justify why Cu has unique high selectivity to hydrocarbons.66,67 Alternatively, as discussed later, the selective paths in CO2 electrocatalytic conversion dramatically depend on the effective surface concentration of adspecies, which is determined by the type of electrode, cells and reaction conditions.
This poses the question of whether the electrocatalytic behaviour and the related mechanistic considerations are only an intrinsic property of the electrocatalyst or instead, a complex interplay exists between the electrocatalyst and reaction conditions and reactor design. This question will be analysed later and is a core aspect of this tutorial review.

Scope and limits of this tutorial review
This tutorial review analyses CO2 methanation using thermal and electro-catalysts from a different perspective than previous studies typically centred on the reaction mechanism and catalyst design. Thus, herein, the aim is not to provide a review of the state-of-the-art thermal or electro-catalysts used in these two processes, as already introduced before. Instead, the objective is to give clues to understand the complexity of moving from thermal to electro-catalysis. In this case, the tutorial impact goes beyond the methanation reaction. It implies a better understanding of the possibilities in moving from conventional thermal catalysis to the novel area of catalysis with the direct use of renewable energy (electro-, photo- and plasma-catalysis) to electrify the chemical production.
This is the fundamental question addressed in this tutorial review. Initially, we analyze a critical fundamental aspect of catalysis by solids, i.e., the competitive adsorption of key reactants and regulation strategies to promote the overall behaviour in thermal catalysts for CO2 methanation. This is a crucial factor for catalyst design. Then, the reader is guided to understand the differences between thermal and electro-catalysis and the complexity of the aspects necessary to include in modelling and designing next-generation electrocatalysts for CO2 methanation.
Building on fundamental aspects for thermal-catalysis: H2 and CO adsorption–dissociation model
Proposing the partition model (CO and CH4)

Effect of reactants and product adsorption–dissociation on CO2 hydrogenation reaction. 
The reaction kinetics indicate that the adsorption–dissociation of the reactants and products determines the catalytic performance. Acceptable catalytic conversion usually requires suitable adsorption–dissociation characteristics of the reactants and rapid desorption of the products.
Methane is the product of the total hydrogenation of CO2. Controlling CO2 hydrogenation allows the synthesis of a range of products.68 However, too strong hydrogenation catalysts may be rapidly deactivated due to the formation of too strongly chemisorbed species. Thus, controlling the surface hydrogenation characteristics is critical for both methane and the other products of partial CO2 hydrogenation.
In addition, CO2 and H2 chemisorb-dissociate on the catalyst surface via the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) or analogous mechanisms. The CO2 has a strong CO bond energy (532 kJ mol−1 or 5.51 eV per bond), resulting in a high activation energy barrier. The activation of carbon dioxide to obtain higher CO2 hydrogenation activity can be modified by tuning the basic sites and the oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface.69 These aspects determine the rate of CO2 conversion. Alternatively, the selectivity depends mainly on the hydrogenation rate of the key intermediate CO. The further hydrogenation of CO is beneficial for high CH4 selectivity. Subsequently, CO is formed primarily due to the rapid desorption of CO.70,71 Metals such as Ru, Ni, Ir and Co have excellent adsorption–dissociation ability for CO, and thus are used as methanation catalysts. CO formation can be increased by weakening the CO adsorption ability.72–74 This conceptual description extends the Sabatier principle (volcano dependence of the behaviour).
However, this conventional model cannot effectively explain some particular phenomena. For example, Pt-based catalysts suffer from CO poisoning caused by strong CO adsorption in many reactions.75 However, they show high CO selectivity at low temperatures in CO2 hydrogenation.76 This is unexpected because low temperatures should favour the formation of CH4.
Nørskov and co-workers proposed that the adsorption and dissociation abilities are almost linear correlated.77 However, the reactivity exhibits a volcano-like dependence on the adsorption/dissociation capacity, also called the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relation.77,78 The adsorption of reactants by catalysts can weaken the internal chemical bonds of the adsorbed molecules and reduce the breaking-bond energy barrier. However, the very strong adsorption leads to ultra-stable adsorption states, inhibiting the adsorption–reaction–desorption process.
This model explains the CO2 hydrogenation characteristics of Pt-based catalysts. Due to the strong adsorption of CO on Pt at low temperatures, the surface CO is weakly reactive under these conditions. As the temperature increases, the strongly adsorbed CO can be activated, forming CH4.
A moderate CO and H2 adsorption activation ability will benefit the further hydrogenation of CO, while too strong or weak activation does not favour the reaction. Therefore, we constructed the partition model diagram (from region ① to ⑦) in Fig. 3. It serves as the basis to rationalize the currently widely studied CO2 hydrogenation catalysts.

Table 1 lists the catalysts, their performances, and the region to which they belong in Fig. 3. These mechanistic considerations can rationalize the existing catalytic properties and be the basis for optimizing the selectivity further. The original data are taken from ref. 79–101.

Typical catalysts in each region. 
The catalytic properties of different catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation have been reported in many reviews.102,103 They demonstrate the current high-performance catalyst structure and composition for the selective hydrogenation of CO2. The effect on CO2 hydrogenation selectivity of the nanostructure or catalyst composition can be rationalized regarding adsorption–dissociation for CO and H2, as shown in Fig. 3.
The catalysts in area ⑦ of Fig. 3, where moderate CO and H2 adsorption and dissociation ability are present, favour further CO hydrogenation and high CH4 selectivity. The catalysts in areas ① and ⑥, where too weak or strong CO adsorption and dissociation are present, predominantly show semi-hydrogenation products (CO, CH3OH, etc.). The catalysts with moderate H2 adsorption/dissociation ability are mainly assigned to path B (areas ⑤ ↔ ⑦ in Fig. 3). Tuning the CO adsorption and activation capacity can interconvert the paths between full and partial hydrogenation.
A high CH4 or CO selectivity is realized in metals such as Ru, Rh, Ir, Ni, and Co by adjusting the metal coordination environment. Li et al.104 used anatase and rutile TiO2 to support Co. On Co/rutile-TiO2, the reaction proceeds to formate species as the intermediate. Using anatase-TiO2, *CO is formed, desorbing as gas-phase CO. By adding Zr to the anatase-based catalyst, subsequently the generated intermediate formate is hydrogenated to CH4. The strongly bonded *CO is required to enhance the subsequent hydrogenation. Thus, the Co/TiO2 catalyst product distribution can be manipulated by adjusting the adsorption performance and surface hydrogenation activity.
On Ni supported on carbon nanotubes, adding LaOx nanoscale patches drastically tuned both the activity and selectivity, resulting in exceptional catalysts with an onset temperature of ∼163 °C with close to 100% CH4 selectivity.105 LaOx introduces basic sites, changing both the CO2 activation and hydrogenation characteristics of the Ni particles. Pu et al.83 achieved 97% CO and 97.5% CH4 selectivity using small (2.7 nm) or larger (11.5 nm) Ni particle sizes, respectively.
Furthermore, as shown in path A (④ ↔ ⑦), different selectivities are possible by tuning the hydrogenation ability. Wang et al.91 adjusted the surface hydroxyl groups on the support to control the H spillover ability to generate efficient surface-active H species and achieved high CO and CH4 selectivities on Rh- or Ru-based catalysts. In addition, many active centres exhibit specific selectivity characteristics. Catalysts such as Au, Cu, Pt and oxides always preferentially show high CO selectivity with a minor role in the coordination environment. Bobadilla et al.93 achieved 100% CO selectivity by loading Au on TiO2 and Al2O3. The classical CuZnAl catalyst exhibited 100% CO selectivity at up to 36% Cu loading.97 Usually, Au, Ag and Cu have weak CO and H2 adsorption ability,106,107 which is essential for their high CO selectivity. Thus, they are assigned to area ⑥.
As mentioned above, the unusual selectivity trend of Pt-based catalysts against temperature is explained by the too-strong CO chemisorption (area ①).
The results reported by Jiang et al.87,107 on the hydrogenation of CO2 to CO using CoH− and NiH− catalysts are relevant to support the concept of H poisoning (area ②). The strong bond between the metal and H weakens the reactivity of the H species. Moreover, it cannot be ignored that the formation of metal hydrides may also affect the adsorption and dissociation of CO.108 Meanwhile, metal hydrides have been studied in the field of semi-hydrogenation.109
Area ③ is special because CO and H2 are strongly adsorbed on the catalyst. For catalysts with homogeneous active sites, there is always highly competitive adsorption between CO and H2. For example, the hydride with a strong metal–H bond had weak CO adsorption as area ②, while the CO-poisoned catalyst was hard to dissociate H2 as area ①.110,111 Therefore, it can be considered an ideal area without examples based on the current level of cognition.
Based on the competition between methanation and reverse water–gas shift (RWGS), the above-mentioned examples can be effectively extended to other RWGS + CO-hydrogenation processes. They illustrated how to tune the selectivity in complex CO2 hydro-conversion networks. In the following sections, we briefly introduce the mechanism, characterization and tuning of CO and H2 adsorption and dissociation.

Adsorption and dissociation mechanism of CO and H2

CO adsorption and dissociation mechanism. 
The bond energy of CO is 1072 kJ mol−1 (11.2 eV), which is higher than that of N2 (942 kJ mol−1, 9.8 eV). However, the polar nature of CO makes it more reactive.112 According to the CO adsorption in Blyholder's model, the 5σ orbital of the CO molecule hybridizes with the unoccupied state (empty state) of the metal, and the 5σ electrons of the CO molecule transfer to the metal state (CO → M) (forward-donation). In addition, the LUMO of CO (2π*) hybridizes with the occupied electron state (mainly the d electron state of the metal) of the metal surface so that the 2π* orbital of CO acquires electrons from the metal (back-donation).113 Back-donation plays a dominant role114 in weakening the C–O bond and activating the CO molecule. Several CO adsorption modes exist including linear and bridge adsorption (2-fold and 3-fold).

In situ IR studies of CO adsorption showed that the adsorption of CO changed from 3-fold bridge adsorption to 2-fold bridge adsorption, and finally to linear adsorption at the top site when the CO coverage changed from low to high.115 Calculations by Gunasooriya et al.116 also indicated that as the coverage increases, chemisorbed CO shifts from the bridge to linear mode. Generally, the bridge adsorption sites are considered to be more reactive.
There are two modes of CO adsorption and activation on metal surfaces. One is the CO dissociation pathway with the C–O bond breaking directly, while the other is CO activation assisted by H species.117 The latter needs to consider the activation of H2 and the energy barrier for the formation of intermediates or decomposition, as well as the strength of the C–O bond. Regardless of the mode of CO activation, it is fundamental to activate the C–O bond by adjusting the adsorption strength of the metal to CO.


H2 adsorption and dissociation mechanism. 
H2 is the simplest diatomic molecule with an H–H bond energy of about 432.0 kJ mol−1 (4.5 eV).118 Its adsorption–dissociation is a critical element in hydrogenation and storage.
There are two main modes of H2 dissociation, i.e., homolytic and heterolytic dissociation.119 In the first mode, the two H atoms chemisorb on two adjacent metal surface atoms, forming M–H bonds and breaking the H–H bond. The M–H bond can be covalent or ionic, depending on the metal electronegativity. Generally, H2 chemisorbs on bulk or nano VIII-group transition metals (Pt, Pd, Ni, Co, etc.), where it dissociates even at room temperature. These metals are the most active hydrogenation catalysts.120
The heterolytic dissociation occurs in catalytic systems without adjacent homo-metal atoms, such as at the metal/support interface,121,122 or on oxide surfaces.123 Its key aspect is the Lewis acid–base site on the catalyst surface, which is the acceptor and donor of electrons for forming hydride (H−) and receiving a proton (H+). Generally, the energy barrier of the homolytic dissociation process on the metal surface is lower than that of heterolytic dissociation.119 Consequently, VIII-group metal-based catalysts are the most used in hydrogenation processes.
For semi-hydrogenation reactions (acetylene hydrogenation or CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, etc.), some oxides or single-atom catalysts are used as H2 dissociation sites to improve the selectivity of the reaction.

Characterization of adsorption and dissociation properties
Evaluation of CO and H2 adsorption–dissociation ability is essential for the design of high-activity and selectivity CO2 hydrogenation catalysts. The adsorption ability is correlated with the dissociation ability but the reactivity and the adsorption–dissociation ability show a volcanic trend78 according to the theoretical modelling of Nørskov et al.77 In addition, the variety of reaction environments (temperature, pressure and energy input, e.g., thermal vs. electro) indicates the need for more advanced models to account for the adsorption–dissociation dependence on the reaction conditions. It is unreasonable to explain the reactivity of a catalyst to CO or H2 using only one parameter (i.e., the adsorption ability). Thus, a comprehensive approach is necessary, requiring the detailed characterization of the adsorption–dissociation capabilities of CO and H2.
The interaction strength between the chemisorbed molecules and the catalyst can be used as one of the references for the dissociation ability. Adsorption calorimetry (AC) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) are the most frequently used methods to characterize the strength of molecular adsorption.124,125
AC is mainly used to evaluate the adsorption properties and distribution of chemisorbed sites on the catalyst based on the differential heat of adsorption of probe molecules measured as a function of the partial pressure or coverage. The distribution of adsorption sites can be quantitatively determined. Li et al.81 used AC to measure the CO adsorption heat in the presence of H2. The CO adsorption heat is lowered by H2, with a more significant reduction observed over Ru/anatase-TiO2 than Ru/rutile-TiO2.
The TPD technique relies on analysing the amount of molecules desorbed (probe molecules), resulting in a linear increase in the temperature. This method is widely used because of its simple nature and easy-to-operate equipment. Li et al.126 used CO-TPD technology to identify two CO adsorption sites on the surface of the CuFeO2 catalyst. where one of them is the strong dissociative adsorption of CO on Fe-containing species. The other site is related to the weak non-dissociative adsorption of CO on the Cu sites. The latter facilitates the CO insertion mechanism to generate more oxygenated products. Sun et al.127 used H2-TPD to discriminate the adsorption capacity of Co/SiO2 and LaCoSiHx for H2, indicating that the latter can better serve as a hydrogen-donating site.
Infrared spectroscopy (IR) is a characterization method employed to analyse the adsorption modes of reactants/intermediates through the infrared vibration frequencies of the chemisorbed species. The linear and bridge adsorption models of CO have different infrared fingerprints. The former is mainly above 2000 cm−1, primarily between 1800–2000 cm−1. Both the transmission and diffuse reflectance (DRIFT) modes are used. Matsubu et al.128 used DRIFT to discriminate the three CO adsorption configurations of Rh/TiO2. The peaks at ∼2097 and ∼2028 cm−1 are associated with the symmetric and asymmetric stretches of Rh(CO)2 at the Ru single-atom site. The peaks at ∼2068 and ∼1860 cm−1 are related to the linear and bridge CO adsorption, respectively. Lu et al.129 summarized the infrared vibrational bands of CO adsorption on single atoms and particles of Ir, Rh, and Pt. However, it is worth noting that the dissociative adsorption of CO (formation of C species) on the catalyst surface cannot be studied directly via IR.126
H2 undergoes heterolytic dissociation on oxides or interfaces, generating surface hydroxyl groups with infrared characteristic vibrations at 3000–3700 cm−1.130,131 The homolytic-dissociation product M–H of H2 on the surface of the metal catalyst is often difficult to detect by infrared. It can be further converted into surface hydroxyl groups via H spillover. The latter indicates that the active H species migrates from the metal surface to the second metal or metal–support interface for subsequent reactions.78,132 H spillover may be the rate-controlling step of the hydrogenation reaction.132
H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was used to characterize H spillover and its role in promoting oxide reduction.133 Enhanced H spillover boosts the hydrogen storage capacity of catalysts, allowing a lower H2 desorption temperature in H2-TPD experiments.134
The H–D isotope exchange experiment utilizes the catalytic reaction between H2 and D2 to evaluate the reaction efficiency of surface H2 species.135 However, whether the H–D exchange directly reflects the H spillover intensity is still disputed.136 There are many reviews and studies on H-spillover.137
How to tune the CO adsorption ability
The strategies to tune the CO adsorption–dissociation properties are summarized in Fig. 4 and described below.
 Fig. 4  Strategies for tuning the CO adsorption–dissociation properties. O (red sphere), C (black sphere), and metal (grey sphere) atoms are shown. 

Type of elements. 
The type of elements used as catalysts is a primary factor affecting the adsorption–dissociation of CO. Bahmanpour et al.107 calculated the adsorption–dissociation ability of CO on the most stable crystal planes (111) of FCC metals such as Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pt, Pd, and Rh (Fig. 5a), which are commonly used for CO2 hydrogenation.

The weak adsorption–dissociation of CO by Cu, Ag and Au with a full d-shell explains why the further hydrogenation of CO during CO2 hydrogenation is inhibited. Ni possesses moderate adsorption and dissociation characteristics for CO. Thus, CH4 is the final product. Ru was not included in the calculation because of its non-fcc phase, even if it shows excellent CO hydrogenation activity. It is usually used for methanation, and Fischer–Tropsch reaction (FTS).142,143 Notably, Pt, Pd and Rh have stronger CO adsorption strength than Ni. Pt-based catalysts typically have a too-strong CO adsorption–dissociation ability, which causes CO poisoning of the catalyst.
In electrocatalysis, Pt-based materials have a strong bonding ability to the COOH and CO intermediates. They activate CO2 to form adsorbed CO at a low overpotential. However, the Pt–CO bond is too strong.144 Replacing the electrocatalyst with Au for faster CO desorption will cause high overpotentials for CO2 activation.145 CO poisoning is a common phenomenon for Pt-based catalysts. Due to this effect, the CH4 selectivity increases at high temperatures, as noted before.76,92,146–148 Sun et al.149 found that CO was strongly adsorbed on the Pt surface and dissociated into C species, inhibiting the adsorption of more CO. Similarly, Erdöhelyi et al.150 found that 5 wt% Pd loaded on Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2, and MgO possesses high CO selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation. Therefore, too weak or too strong CO adsorption is unsuitable for CO2 methanation.


Coordination number. 
The role of crystal faces was examined by Blyholder et al.113 They proposed that metal–CO bonding at higher coordination numbers in the flat crystal plane is weaker than at lower metal coordination numbers (as edge or corner sites). This is because the electrons donated from CO are distributed by more metal atoms, which do not benefit from the back-donation. In addition, the high CO coverage on the metal surface causes the back-donation electrons to be received by more CO molecules. This aspect will also lead to the weakening of the adsorption strength.
Sung and Hoffmann114 found that back-donation plays a dominant role in the adsorption and dissociation of CO on Ni, Co and Ti surfaces. A higher d charge density on metal surfaces enhances the adsorption–dissociation of CO for Pt.151 The different crystal planes on the metal surface have different coordination states, showing distinct CO adsorption–dissociation properties.152 For example, hexagonal close packing (HCP) Co has significantly stronger adsorption and dissociation ability for CO than face-centred cubic (FCC) Co during CO hydrogenation (FTS).153 However, it is practically challenging to control and stabilize the specific crystal planes in catalysts.


Particle size. 
It is easy to generate low-coordination sites (edge, steps, corner, etc.) when the metal changes from bulk to nanosize and is dispersed on a support. However, in sub-nano particles, clusters or even single atoms, the interaction between the metal and support may decrease the charge density of the active metal (forming Mδ+). This inhibits the back-donation, thus weakening the adsorption ability of CO.154
Vogt et al.72 unravelled the structure sensitivity in CO2 hydrogenation over nickel, where the CO adsorption strength decreased with a decrease in Ni particle size. Neither strong nor weak CO adsorption was suitable for CO2 hydrogenation to CH4 through the RWGS + CO hydrogenation path. Aitbekova et al.138 showed that oxidative pre-treatment induces redispersion of Ru NPs supported on CeO2. This change leads to conversion from methanation to an RWGS catalyst with high CO selectivity (Fig. 5b). Increasing the dispersion of Ru species by decreasing the Ru loading79 or by pore confinement155 reduces the CO adsorption and changes the dominant product from CH4 to CO.
Tuxenn et al.156 studied the effect of particle size of Co on CO dissociation, showing that CO dissociates more efficiently on larger particles (15 nm) than smaller particles (4 nm). Liu et al.157 synthesized a single-atom Pt–Cu alloy based on Cu, which effectively avoids the poisoning effect of CO on the adsorption and dissociation ability of H2 (H–D exchange capacity). Yang et al.158 calculated the adsorption and dissociation of CO after incorporating Rh, Ni, Pt, Pd, Cu, and Au in the Cu(111) lattice. Ni/Cu has a moderate CO binding energy and has the highest activity for CO2 hydrogenation to methane. Due to their excellent CO adsorption ability, increasing the dispersion will weaken the CO adsorption and dissociation capacity in Ru, Ni, and Co-based catalysts. On the contrary, for relatively inert elements such as Au, Cu, and Ag, the dispersion increases the metal/support interfaces, enhancing the CO adsorption ability.154,159


Doping with heteroatoms. 
The addition of heteroatoms to the lattice can reduce the metal coordination number and weaken CO adsorption. When too strong CO adsorption inhibits the reactivity, metal alloying can reduce the adsorption ability, thus improving the reactivity (Fig. 5c). Ni is a common element for methanation catalysts, typically supported on ZrO2, TiO2 and CeO2. However, NixZny alloy shows higher CO selectivity than Ni/ZnO.84
The formation of metal carbides is another way to change the intrinsic behaviour of active metal elements. Michalsky et al. calculated the adsorption energy of metal carbides having similar properties to that of noble metals. However, the surface of carbides is oxophilic and carbophobic. This led to the weak adsorption and dissociation of CO. This fact explains the high CO selectivity of the MoCx catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation.160 Metal carbides such as Mo2C and W2C have weak CO adsorption and high CO selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation.161–163 In addition, this oxophilic property may also lead to the transition of reaction intermediates to formate, which cannot be neglected in practical catalytic studies.164
Fe-Based catalysts are widely used in the hydrogenation of CO (Fischer–Tropsch synthesis). FeCx is the main active phase, making the dissociation of CO on a perfect FeCx surface difficult. However, H2 interaction creates C vacancies, on which the rapid dissociation of CO occurs.165 Co is also a common active element of CO hydrogenation catalysts (FTS). Xiang et al.166 reported reversible carbide (Co2C) formation in an H2/CO atmosphere, which may be one of the regulatory strategies for Co as the active centre of RWGS.


Addition of promoters and role of the support. 
Alkali metals, as common electron-donating additives, are often used to modulate the electronic state of active metals. The incorporation of Na and K can increase the electron density of Fe, which is beneficial to for the activation of CO, making it easier to form FeCx species.167 Simultaneously, FeCx may have stronger CO dissociation ability than Fe.160
Petala and Panagiotopoulou168 found that the addition of a small amount (0.2 wt%) of alkali metal can significantly improve the CO2 hydrogenation activity and methane selectivity, following the order of Na > Cs > K ∼ Li > TiO2 (unpromoted). The optimized addition of alkali metals enhances the adsorption and dissociation ability of CO. However, too much alkali metal doping leads to the active sites being covered.169 Accordingly, based on this blocking effect, the adsorption and dissociation ability of CO can be weakened.170 The addition of alkali metals was performed by impregnating commercial TiO2.
MnO is an excellent promoter of Fischer–Tropsch synthesis and CO2 methanation.171 The incorporation of MnO reduces the adsorption capacity of CO and introduces a new strong adsorption state (infrared peaks at 1800–1900 cm−1). The reduction of CO adsorption capacity by MnO is possibly due to the partial encapsulation of MnO on the metal during the reduction process.172 The new strong adsorption sites were associated with M–C–O–Mn bridge sites, which have stronger reactivity (Fig. 5d).140 Yang et al.173 suggested the formation of Rh and MnO interfaces than complex oxides or alloys, promoting the dissociation of CO. The strong oxophilicity of MnO is the key to forming CO bridge adsorption modes.174 The Lewis acid site of ZrO2 can strongly interact with O, which has a similar effect of promoting CO adsorption and dissociation as MnO additives.175,176
In regulating the metal coordination environment, changing the type of carrier is the simplest and most practical approach. However, the possible strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) has to be considered.177 The SMSI inhibits the adsorption and dissociation ability of CO and H2 after high-temperature treatment using reducible supports such as TiO2, MnO, and Nb2O5. As shown in Fig. 5e, high-temperature reduction enhances SMSI for Pt/TiO2 catalysts, resulting in negligible CO adsorption capacity.141 High-resolution electron microscopy and other characterizations showed that SMSI is associated with the migration of the oxide carrier on the metal surface. This occurs during the reduction process, forming a coating layer or an alloy phase.178 The SMSI phenomenon has also been extended to irreducible carriers,179 non-VIII group metals95 and even oxidation treatment.180,181
Bao et al. utilized the SMSI effect to convert traditional Ni182 and Ru-based183 methanation active centres into RWGS active centres. Yuan et al.184 found that the encapsulation of FeOx on Ni could effectively improve the CO selectivity of the catalyst. This special SMSI effect provides opportunities to develop efficient RWGS or CO insertion sites for semi-hydrogenation catalysts. However, a too-strong SMSI effect reduces the available active metals, resulting in low atom utilization and catalytic activity.


Other possibilities. 
In addition to the abovementioned strategies, a less conventional option is competitive adsorption. Similar to the inhibition of the further adsorption of CO at high CO coverage, competitive co-adsorption modifies the surface properties. Primet et al.185 found that the co-adsorption of CO and benzene, ethylene, ammonia, or oxygen induces frequency shifts (Δv = 43, 37, 67 and 15 cm−1, respectively) in the infrared bands that reflect the change in CO adsorption intensity. McEntee et al.186 showed that Au becomes electron-rich or electron-poor when electron-donating or electron-accepting molecules are co-adsorbed on the Au/TiO2 catalyst, respectively. This modification determines the change in chemisorbed CO from back-donation to forward donation.
Surface modification by coordinating ligands is another possibility. Zhang et al.32 modified catalysts with short-chain methylphosphonic acid (MPA) organic ligands to transfer electrons from the metal to the phosphonate anion (Fig. 5f). Employing this approach, they suppressed the adsorption activation of CO, obtaining a CO2 hydrogenation catalyst with high CO selectivity.
In addition, CO and H2 show competitive adsorption on the metal surface. CO tends to form 3-fold bridge adsorption on the catalyst surface at low CO coverage. Thus, more exposed metal sites favour H-assisted CO activation. For single-atom catalysts, the lack of adjacent atoms to dissociate CO and H2 simultaneously is one of the crucial reasons for the high CO selectivity.128 Therefore, adjusting the adsorption ratio of CO and H2 on the metal surface is a critical way to control the CO2 hydrogenation degree. The addition of MnO to the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst reduced the catalyst surface CO/H2 ratio.174

How to tune the H2 adsorption ability
The adsorption and activation of H2 are relevant in controlling the degree of hydrogenation. The tuning strategies of H2 adsorption and activation based on homolytic and heterolytic dissociation (Fig. 6) are discussed below.
 Fig. 6  Active site-determined H2 homolytic or heterolytic activation. Dissociation model diagram references. Adapted with permission from ref. 119 Copyright 2022, the American Chemical Society. 

Nature of the active sites. 
The type of active centre affects the H2 dissociation energy barrier. Greely and Mavrikakis106 determined the adsorption and dissociation of H2 on different transition metals and near-surface alloys by DFT. The strong interaction between Group VIII metals (Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, etc.) and H2 is beneficial for H2 dissociation. These metals have excellent performances and are widely used in hydrogenation reactions.187,188 Cu has a relatively weak adsorption capacity for H2 because Cu–H is slightly stronger than the H–H bond, resulting in weak H2 dissociation.106 However, bulk Au and Ag are relatively stable and cannot adsorb H2 based on thermodynamics.189 Simultaneously, supported nano-sized Au or Ag may have hydrogenation activity via the oxide support.190,191 Thus, Au, Cu or oxide catalysts with weak H2 dissociation ability are often used in many semi-hydrogenation processes, such as acetylene hydrogenation to ethylene and CO2 hydrogenation to methanol or syngas.93,192–194 The synthesis of alloys is a tunable strategy to regulate the metal–H bond energy.106
H2 dissociation can be effectively regulated by adjusting the coordination environment of the metal. Active elements such as Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ir can dissociate H2 through rapid homolytic dissociation when present as nanoparticles. Thus, supported catalysts show methane selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation.
By reducing the particle size or even creating single atoms or clusters, the H2 dissociation changes from a homolytic to a heterolytic process due to the lack of adjacent metal atoms. This fact significantly reduces the H2 dissociation ability.195 It is similar to the CO adsorption case discussed earlier. Thus, it is difficult to distinguish the contributions of weak H2 and CO adsorption and dissociation to high CO selectivity during CO2 hydrogenation.


Metal/support interface for H2 heterolytic dissociation. 
In supported Au small nanoclusters, the unsaturated coordination sites at the metal/support interface create sites for the dissociation of H2, forming O2−−H+−H−–Au due to the strong interaction between O2− and H+ (Fig. 7a).196,197

Weak hydrogenation systems such as Au/Al2O3 and Au/TiO2 have high CO selectivity for the selective hydrogenation of CO2 (Fig. 7b).93 Using this strategy, Ag can also be used as the hydrogenation catalytic active centre.199 Similarly, Cu4 clusters supported on TiC showed a low dissociation energy barrier for H2.189 However, elements such as Au, Ag, and Cu, having intrinsically poor H2 dissociation ability, do not allow to use of this strategy and fully hydrogenate CO2 to CH4. The strong interaction of the Pd4 and Pt4 clusters with TiC leads to surface polarization and electron transfer from the support to the metal instead. In these systems, H2 does not dissociate effectively.189
Thus, enhancing the H2 adsorption ability of weak H2-adsorbing catalysts such as Au and Cu improves H2 activation. Strengthening the H2 adsorption ability of Pd and Pt (having strong H2-adsorption character) inhibits the H2 activation. This aspect is consistent with the description of the Nørskov rule described earlier.


Metal oxide for H2 heterolytic dissociation. 
Usually, the oxide support is considered to play a role in the activation of CO2. However, its role in dissociating hydrogen is neglected.70,102 Compared with metal-based catalysts, CO2 hydrogenation on metal–oxide catalysts without deposited metal nanoparticles, e.g., metal-free following the standard definition, requires higher reaction temperatures with CO as the only reaction product.98,99,101
Metal oxides generally dissociate H2 through the heterolytic mechanism, and the unsaturated coordination metal and oxygen act as Lewis acid and Lewis base sites, respectively. The former captures the electrons of the H2 bonding orbital, while the latter provides electrons for the antibonding orbital to weaken the H–H bond and form M–H and M–OH. Fig. 7c shows the H2 heterolytic activation process over In2O3.198
M–H is difficult to detect experimentally. García-Melchor et al.123 indicated by DFT calculations that the dissociation of H2 on CeO2 leads to Ce–H, but it is rapidly further converted, generating –OH species, which are instead detected. The introduction of vacancies is an effective way to improve the dissociation rate of H2. These oxygen vacancies depend on the shape of the oxide nanoparticles, the exposed crystal plane, dispersity, doping of heteroatoms, etc.200 Jia et al.201 discussed in detail the use of oxides for CO2 hydrogenation in their tutorial review. Oxides, due to the heterolytic dissociation mechanism, have poor H2 dissociation rates with respect to systems where homolytic dissociation is present. Generally, they lead to semi-hydrogenation reactions such as CO2 reduction to CO (Fig. 7d).101
In addition to the standard Lewis acid–base pair for the heterolytic dissociation of H2, frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) may enhance H2 dissociation. These sites are close enough to activate small molecules, but their geometry avoids acid–base neutralization.202 In heterogeneous catalysts, FLPs can dissociate H2, creating a constrained coupled site formed by a defect acting as a Lewis base and a coordinatively unsaturated metal acting as a Lewis acid. Zhang et al.203 calculated the energy barrier for dissociating H2 by FLPs, which is only 0.17 eV, while that on the ideal CeO2 surface is 0.65 eV. Ma et al. discussed FLPs in solid catalysts.204


Metal hydride. 
The use of metal hydrides derived from the strong metal–H bond to tune the hydrogenation properties in CO2 conversion has not been specifically studied. However, it is known that they have interesting properties. Chen and coworkers109,205 intensively studied these materials for ammonia synthesis and acetylene hydrogenation. PdHx has significantly higher selectivity for the hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene compared with the Pd catalyst,109 and thus it can be considered that the hydrogenation activity of the hydride is weakened due to the strong metal–H bond. Meanwhile, the strong binding strength with H (PdHx) may also inhibit CO adsorption,108 and thus metal hydrides may be suitable for CO2 hydrogenation to CO rather than CH4.


H-Spillover. 
Different sites, as commented before, can exist for the adsorption and activation of H2 and CO2, for example, the metal nanoparticles and the support, respectively. In this case, the active H species should move from the metal surface to the carrier surface or interface (H-spillover). Reducing the distance between the H2 and CO2 activation sites will reduce the energy barrier of the hydrogenation process, as shown in Fig. 8a.132 Wang et al.91 prepared a zeolite with/without surface hydroxyl groups to support Rh-based nanoparticles. They observed that the zeolitic support with surface hydroxyl groups exhibited more efficient H-spillover. The catalyst showed higher activity in CO2 hydrogenation to CH4 than the analogous catalyst without hydroxyl groups, where latter formed CO instead (Fig. 8b).

Adapted with permission from ref. 91 Copyright 2019, the American Chemical Society. 
H-Spillover can also weaken the H poisoning due to the too-strong adsorption of H. Ru is a very active element for ammonia synthesis. Kinetic studies on this catalyst indicated that the reaction order of H2 is lower than zero due to the self-inhibition by strong adsorption of H species on Ru. The introduction of defect sites on an MgO support can enhance H-spillover from the strongly adsorbed hydrogen on the Ru surface to the support, thus creating efficient hydrogenation catalysts. Giannakakis et al.78 reviewed synthesis strategies by alloying to boost the migration of H from a noble metal to another metal to enhance the reactivity of the H species. In an alkali metal (Na+)-stabilized Ru single-atom catalyst, H2 dissociates to form Ru–Hδ− and adjacent O–Hδ+.206 The bonding of Na+ to Hδ− makes Hδ− transfer from the Ru surface to the Na surface, also preserving the Ru–O–Al structure anchoring the Ru single atom from Hδ− attack. This effect provides stability to the Ru single atom.
H spillover involves the migration of H+ and e− pairs. The migration of H species also influences the electronic structure of the catalyst surface.207 Li et al.81 observed that H-spillover on Ru/a-TiO2 is enhanced compared to that on Ru/r-TiO2, where a and r indicate the anatase and rutile phases, respectively. The enhanced spillover also increases the electron transport over the support to form Ruδ+, which weakens CO adsorption, leading to higher CO selectivity.
The H species migrate on the support as –OH and hydride, which are inhibited by the presence of H2O, explaining the negative effect of water on CO2 hydrogenation.208 In addition, the presence of H2O inhibits the transfer of protons and electrons formed by dissociating H2 on Au to the carrier, resulting in the accumulation of negative charges on Au, increasing the transition state energy by 0.2 eV, and thereby inhibiting the adsorption and dissociation of H2.209
The H spillover depends on the chemical potential of H species. Usually, tuning the support properties (reducibility, hydroxyl content, composite support, defect, etc.) is the most effective way to change the H-spillover. Prins136 and Xiong et al.137 reviewed these aspects.
CO and H2 are key species in CO2 hydrogenation. The control strategies for regulating their adsorption were discussed in detail in this section. The active element nature is the most critical factor in the adsorption process. The selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation depends on the nature of the catalytic element. However, this adsorption capability can be weakened to tune the selectivity through specific regulatory strategies (e.g., coordination number, heteroatom doping, and SMSI).
The operative pressure is another parameter affecting the reaction network in CO2 hydro-conversion, where the competitive reactions of RWGS and CO-hydrogenation are present. In summary, in heterogeneous (thermal) catalysis for CO2 methanation, tuning the intrinsic characteristics of the active sites is the primary factor in catalyst design and understanding the different performances. It is assumed in the literature that this approach can also be applied to electrocatalysis. Thus, the validity of this assumption is analyzed in the next section.

From thermal to electro-catalysis
In the previous section, we discussed the fundamental aspects of the adsorption–dissociation model as a crucial factor in the design of thermal CO2 methanation catalysts and understanding their behaviour. Alternatively, in this section, we examine whether the same approach is valid for electrocatalytic CO2 methanation. We already introduced the concept of higher complexity and critical differences in moving from thermal to electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the standard practice considers applying the same methodologies for both valid cases without adequately considering the differences.
A critical point emerges from the following discussion and explains why the description related to electrocatalysis is presented from a totally different perspective than that of thermal catalysis. The essential mechanistic elements used in rationalizing thermal catalysis, e.g., the role of the binding energies of the adsorbed *CO and *H species, is no longer valid to rationalize electrocatalysis. In the latter, the surface concentration of the adspecies determines the path, but this concentration is dictated by the transport aspects rather than by the intrinsic surface properties of the electrocatalyst. Thus, the electrocatalytic performances have to be rationalized from this perspective. However, this is an aspect scarcely recognized in the literature. Accordingly, clarifying it is the main aim of this tutorial. For this reason, the discussion is organized differently in the thermal and electrocatalytic parts.
We further clarify these aspects with an example. We commented before that Pt may be a selective thermal catalyst for methane under conditions where the self-inhibition by the formation of CO is reduced, e.g., at high temperatures. Thus, in principle, Pt will not be active in the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 because CO is a central intermediate from CO2 electroreduction, which occurs at room temperature. Surendranath and coworkers210 indicated that surface-bound H and CO species compete for the active sites and are essential for more efficient catalysis. However, if the concentration of these species is only determined by their binding energies, it will be impossible to form methane in CO2 electroreduction on Pt. Umeda et al.59 showed that it is possible to form methane on Pt using an appropriate strategy, e.g., by controlling the surface population of *COx and *H species on the electrocatalyst by regulating the transport properties. We showed, as commented later, that under certain conditions, Pt may become a selective electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction. Thus, these results introduce the main point discussed in the following section that electrocatalysis has to be analyzed from a different perspective than thermal analysis in terms of the factors determining the behavior. This has relevant mechanistic implications, as introduced above, but it not enough clear in the literature.
Differences between thermal and electro-catalysis
Earlier, we introduced the concept of “reactive” catalysis to differentiate between the catalysis required in electro-, photo- and non-thermal plasma-catalysis processes from the “thermal” catalysis currently used in refinery, biorefinery and petrochemistry processes.37,38,211 A central common aspect in “reactive” catalysis is that highly reactive species (electron and holes, radicals, vibrationally excited species, etc.) are generated in these catalysts by charge separation derived from the application of an electrical potential, light absorption or by interaction with the radicals and “hot” electrons generated in the gas phase in the case of plasma.
Generally, reactive catalysts operate at room temperature, with the energy for the process provided by the reactive species rather than heat.38 In “thermal” catalysis, the rate-limiting step is typically the adsorption/transformation of the reactant molecules. The temperature provides the energy to overcome the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step. The energy profiles determine the transformation paths, and consequently, the activity and selectivity. Often multiple paths are possible; thus, a key question is what determines the activity and selectivity. In the discussion in the previous section, we presented several examples of how to analyse this critical aspect. However, it was also shortly introduced that electrocatalysts behave differently, and thus require a different model for the interpretation of the results.

The role of the electrolyte. 
The first evident difference between thermal and electrocatalysis, besides the different temperature ranges of operation, is the presence of a potential, an electrolyte, and thus the creation of an electrical double layer at the interface. This difference impacts the mechanistic/kinetics of the reaction. The main conclusion of this tutorial is to evidence this difference and the consequent impact in terms of methodologies to analyze the data and design criteria for developing electrocatalysts. The role of the electrolyte in the electrocatalytic performances in CO2 methanation has been marginally reviewed in the literature for this specific reaction,66 while generally regarding CO2 electroreduction212,213 or specifically for the CO2 to CO conversion.214 The characteristics of the electrolyte (concentration, species, buffer capacity, and pH value) influence the local reaction conditions, thus impacting the pathways of CO2 conversion. They also determine the mass transfer and availability of protons at the surface of the electrocatalysts, thus determining the rate of the side reaction of hydrogen evolution (HER) and the transformation paths of CO2, influencing both the nature and concentration of C-based intermediates. However, these aspects are strongly linked to the electrode and reactor design, determining the local fluidodynamics at the interface, which is often not considered.
The electrolyte has a relevant influence on the kinetics, selectivity, and other less-recognised aspects. For example, the possibility of (i) reaching high current densities, which is a crucial aspect for industrial exploitability, and (ii) minimising the overpotential, which is related to the overall energy efficiency of the electrocatalytic process. An electrolyte with a high pH (up to 15) was used to minimize the HER and obtain a high current density.215 However, operating in these conditions, the energy efficiency was negatively affected by the rapid and thermodynamically favourable reaction of CO2 with hydroxide (OH−) to form carbonate (CO32−), which resulted in large voltage and CO2 losses.216 The hydroxide consumption results in strong alkaline electrolyte fuel-wasting devices. A high pH minimizes the cell voltage due to the chemical potential and dependence of the thermodynamic electrode potentials on the pH. It appears to have high energy efficiency, but globally considering the impact of the electrolyte treatment to realize stable operations, it results in an energy-inefficient process.
Therefore, the role of the electrolyte cannot be disjointed from the design of the electrode and electrocatalytic reactor, as well as the overall assessment of the process. However, these aspects have been scarcely recognized in the literature to date.
In addition, there increasing research attention is focused on electrode/reactor design avoiding the presence of a liquid electrolyte, which is referred to as gas-phase, electrolytes or zero-gap operations,217 although these are different terms to indicate the same concept. The literature results show that under these conditions, which are all based on the use of gas-diffusion electrodes (GDE), the surface coverage of *COx species is higher, thus influencing the kinetics and paths of conversion.31 In a recent theoretical micro-kinetic study, the key steps in the gas phase (no electrolyte), aqueous electrolyte and aprotic solvent in CO2 electrocatalysis were discussed.218 The microkinetic model is based on the CO* and H* binding energies as descriptors and classifies the different metals in relation to how the three different types of electrocatalytic operations influence them. However, the preexponential factors are fitting parameters. Thus, the microkinetic models do not consider the concentration of the adspecies, if is not employed as a fitting parameter. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate how the electrolyte is not an independent aspect from the electrode/reactor characteristics and how the rate of conversion and selectivity depend in a highly interconnected way on all these aspects, rather than only the electrolyte.


The use of a membrane. 
The membrane is an integral part of the electrochemical reactors, which separates the anodic and cathodic compartments, avoiding cross-diffusion between them. Although electrocatalysts for membrane-free operations were developed,219 they operate only at low current densities. Alternatively, the membrane was integrated in the electrode, forming a membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) and a gas-diffusion electrode (GDE).220,221 This is the necessary direction to address the key challenges in the industrial development of electrolyzers, e.g., ohmic resistance and complex reactor design.
Different membranes can be used. The standard configuration is to transport the protons from the anodic zone (where the OER occurs, for example) to the cathodic zone, where CO2 reduction occurs. In this case, protonic membranes such as Nafion are used. They have high protonic conductivity but are only stable at the maximum temperature of about 80 °C. The main role of the membrane is to avoid crossover effects. However, at high current densities, crossover leads to a substantial underestimation of the effective catalytic performance.222
Anionic or bipolar membranes223–226 were also used in CO2 electrolyzers, but typically they show a higher resistance, and there is no clear evidence that they are advantageous in CO2 methanation. However, proton exchange membranes possess a strong acidic chemical environment, facilitating the undesirable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A proton antagonist strategy, through which the proton diffusion pathways have been severely impeded by the Na+ cation to produce an alkaline-rich environment, has been proposed to suppress the side HER.227 However, this approach leads to the generation of CO rather than CH4.


Influence of cations/anions in the electrolyte. 
A consequence of the proton antagonist strategy is its influence on the solid–liquid interface because there is an accumulation of cations at the interface. The cation size and its related impact on the interfacial electric field are critical factors influencing the electrochemical reduction of CO2.228 Similarly, the anions in the electrolyte influence the electroreduction of CO2.229 The anion buffering capacity affects the changes in the pH near the electrode surface. In addition, the anions may donate hydrogen directly to the electrode, influencing its behaviour.
Although the effect of cations/anions in determining the performance of electrolytes is a relevant aspect to consider, their effect when deliberately added has to be determined with respect to other factors, such as stability, ionic conductivity, impact on the separation of the products of CO2 reduction, and scalability of the system, and impact on other relevant aspects such as wettability. Thus, the electrolyte, and the options to avoid it, the type of membrane, and the role of cations/anions are some of the aspects related to the engineering of the process, which has to be evaluated from a global perspective.

Modification of electrocatalysts by organic functional groups
The possibility of influencing the microenvironment around the electrocatalyst surface to control its electrocatalytic behaviour is another emerging trend in developing advanced solutions for CO2 electroreduction. These organic ligands can alter (nudge) the reaction towards certain products, for example, by blocking water molecules and favouring specific adsorption configurations and intermediate stability.230 Liquid–solid boundaries dominate the activity of CO2 reduction on GDE, and interfacial microenvironment engineering is a crucial aspect.231–236 Thus, tuning the interface by functionalization with pendant organic functional groups has become a recent relevant trend in designing advanced electrodes. Besides, these organic ligands can act as organo-cocatalysts in CO2 electroconversion. In addition, these organic surface functionalities can change and tune the surface. They influence the local electric field (see later) and provide additional electrostatic interaction near the catalyst surface.237 This effect is similar to that from cations in the electrolyte, as discussed in the previous section.228,238–240 However, a major difference between the cation effect and organic surface functionalities, such as histidine,237 is that the latter can adsorb specifically on the electrocatalyst surface under cathodic bias. Further, the hydration shell of the organic moiety is much larger than alkali cations but softer, thus enabling higher surface charge accumulation than alkaline metal cations.
However, there are no specific studies concerning CO2 methanation, where the cited studies are mainly dedicated to enhancing the C2+ path. Nevertheless, it is an essential factor to consider in designing advanced electrodes.
After this brief survey of the recent relevant trends in CO2 electrocatalytic conversion, it is important to discuss other less present aspects in the literature.

The features of electro-catalysis and the role of the local electrical field and non-homogeneous charge distribution. 
Generally, many aspects differentiate electrocatalysis from thermal catalysis on solid materials. A charge is present on the surface of electrocatalysts and depends on the applied potential. Although it is often assumed that a flat charge distribution exists (also in modelling and electrochemistry theory241–243), the charge, and thus the local potential are not uniform due to the nanostructure of electrocatalysts.244,245 The charge and potential distribution on the surface of the catalyst strongly depends on its nanostructure and all the typical elements associated with mechanistic aspects to describe the catalyst reactivity, such as defects and vacancies, strain, heterojunctions and interfaces, presence of amorphous phases or layers, and presence of dopants, and also associated with the changes in the charge localization and distribution. Generally, electrochemistry theory associates the electrical potential difference with the electron transfer rate. Thus, the local potential, which depends on the local charge accumulation, is influenced by these aspects, and consequently the activity and selectivity.
Usually, in electrocatalysis and catalysis, the active sites are related to the presence of defects, interfaces, etc. Many studies in designing electrocatalysts indicate that, for example, defect or interface engineering is the main design parameter.246–251 However, typically it is not considered the behaviour is only indirectly associated with the presence of these sites.252 These sites are not active elements themselves, but rather they induce a change in the surface distribution of the potential, and this is the effect determining the behaviour. Accordingly, a few recent studies have started to consider this possibility.
Beinlich et al.253 analysed the field effects at protruding defect sites on metal electrodes in electrocatalysis. At the protruding defect sites, steps and kinks determine the local field enhancement, which induces modifications in the dipole–field interactions, e.g., reorganization of the electrolyte near the catalyst surface with a consequential impact on the electrochemical reactivity. Moreover, the ordered nano-units will provide a stronger local electric field (Fig. 9a and b).254 Liu et al.255 indicated that the local field induces changes in the mass transfer through the electrical double layer, and consequently in the kinetics of the process. They claimed to have introduced a new concept of local-field-induced mass transfer in nano-electrocatalytic systems. Employing a theoretical approach, Vijas et al.256 showed that the dipole–field interactions in CO2 adsorption, and thus the dependence on local field enhancements determine the overall activity. A coating of ∼5 nm of polytetra-fluoroethylene on copper nano-needles increased the electric field, enriching the surface with K+ ions, which enhance the adsorption of CO2 and CO (Fig. 9c and d).257 This approach resolves the experimental inconsistency between typical electrochemical parameters, such as the Tafel slope and the activity. Nørskov and coworkers258 showed by a theoretical approach that the electric field could significantly stabilize the key intermediates of electrochemical reduction of CO2. In their review of mechanistic studies of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction, Chan et al.259 evidenced that current theoretical ab initio models of the electrolyte and electrochemical reaction barriers are far from an accurate description of the behaviour. Similar conclusions were also reported by He et al.260 They discussed the role of the solvent dynamics near the electrode, which depend on the local electrical field.

FEM (finite element method) simulation provides a means to study the local electric field distribution more comprehensively. Liu et al.257 calculated a 3-dimensional (3D) image of the electric field and thermal field distribution at the tip of a Cu nano-needle through FEM simulation. They combined the imaging with DFT calculations to explain that the enhanced electric field at the tip leads to the enhanced adsorption of CO*, thereby improving the FE of C2 (Fig. 9c).
A similar issue is present in analysing the role of nanoparticle shape in electrocatalysis. Loiudice et al.244,245,262 indicated that in the electrochemical reduction of CO2, the copper nanocrystal shape and size have a drastic effect on both activity (current density) and faradaic selectivity. The result was interpreted in terms of the density of edge sites over the (100) plane sites. However, it was not considered that, at the same time, many other properties relevant to electrocatalysis change in a parallel way. When a potential is applied to a nanocrystal, a near-surface electric field of a significant magnitude can be induced outside the surface with its features depending on its nanoshape.261Fig. 9e illustrates this concept. There is an induced modification in the electrical double layer and electrode organization near the surface,263 in the local potential and related effects on the electrocatalytic reactivity.
In conclusion, increasing evidence shows that electrocatalysis requires a specific approach different from thermal catalysis and electrochemistry. Thus, advances in understanding with respect to most of the current electrochemical approaches are necessary. A non-uniform charge distribution on the electrocatalyst, which strongly depends on the nanostructure of the electrocatalyst and electrode, determines its behaviour. The near-surface localized electrical field is a crucial aspect to consider, which induces a non-uniform double layer and near-surface electrolyte reorganization, causing modifications in the surface adlayer and electrocatalyst reactivity and/or selectivity. However, studies in this direction are in their infancy, and a more systematic approach is still lacking.264–267


The potential-induced electrocatalyst reorganization. 
Other relevant aspects also differentiate thermal from electro-catalysis. In particular, the possibility of inducing reversible potential-dependent changes in the electrocatalyst surface. These studies require operando characterization methods in electrocatalytic operation conditions. Genovese et al.268 and Arrigo et al.269 showed by operando surface-sensitive near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) that the defect sites in small iron nanoparticles (<2 nm) stabilized on a carbon substrate undergo dynamic in situ reconstruction with the formation of γ-FeOOH. This surface structure resembles the active centres of the nitrogenase enzyme, selectively converting CO2 to C2+ products and N2 to NH3 through a multi-electron/proton reaction mechanism.270 Operando electrocatalysis studies are a relevant emerging area of investigation.271,272 However, studies evidencing a dynamic reconstruction of the active sites depending on the applied potential are still limited.273,274
This dynamic reconstruction also depends on the electrolyte and the effective fluidodynamics at the electrode, which influences the characteristics of the double layer, the local pH and the localization of the charge at the electrocatalyst surface.


The role of a charged electrocatalyst. 
A further relevant difference between electro- and thermal-catalysis is that the charges generated on the electrocatalyst surface modify many elements, from the stabilization or destabilization of the intermediates to the diffusion of ions on the electrolyte. Considering CO2 electro-conversion at the cathode, the first step is likely one-electron transfer to form a carbon dioxide anion radical species (˙CO2−), which is often indicated as the reaction intermediate in CO2 electro-conversion.275 This species is negatively charged, and thus tends to move away from the negatively charged electrocatalyst surface (cathodic electroreduction). Adsorption on the electrocatalyst of this species is also inhibited. Therefore, stabilization of this reaction intermediate to electrostatic repulsion should be considered from a mechanistic perspective, even if typically neglected. A similar question arises regarding the effective reacting species of carbon dioxide. The equilibrium CO2 of in an aqueous solution strongly depends on the pH. CO2 ⇌ H2CO3 ⇌ HCO3− ⇌ CO32−(1)
The effective species converted is often under debate. Bicarbonate, rather than solvated CO2 in the aqueous electrolyte, has been indicated as the true reactive species, even if interconversion between the species shown in eqn (1) always occurs.276,277 However, it may be questioned how the bicarbonate ion can effectively approach the negatively charged electrocatalyst surface.
The electrolyte typically contains ions to promote conductivity, and the adsorption of the ions on the electrocatalyst is known to significantly influence its activity and faradaic selectivity.278,279 Cations can help bind the negatively charged reactants or intermediates, while adsorption on anions has a positive effect. Alternatively, their adsorption influences the local near-surface electrical field, the potential, the local structure of the electrolyte and the double electrical layer. Thus, there are many possible effects, but they often not considered adequately from a mechanistic perspective.
Developing 3D electrodes is a current research trend to increase charge density (productivity) based on the geometrical electrode area.280,281 An aspect often overlooked is that a charged porous material would be present in these electrodes. However, the investigation of the mass diffusion in porous electrodes (charged and perhaps with a non-homogeneous charge distribution) is still very limited.282,283 Thus, gradients may be present, with the consequent non-homogeneous adsorption of ions on the electrocatalyst. Due to the electrochemical reactions, a significant change in pH occurs, which depends on both the fluidodynamic aspects of the electrolyte–electrode interface and the electrolyte itself.
In a porous charged electrode, the diffusion of H+ or OH− ions will be affected, leading thus to the presence of pH gradients in porous 3D electrodes, with the related influence on the activity and selectivity.

The relevance of reactor and electrode design: moving to electrolyte-less electrocatalytic reactors
The engineering aspects of integrated catalyst and reactor design are well-defined, while that for electrocatalytic reactions are less studied.284–288 However, they play a crucial role in determining the performance. In thermal catalysis, the reactor fluidodynamics defines the presence of mass or heat transfer limitations at the catalyst pellet level. Thus, the reaction rate may be significantly different from that estimated by assuming the concentration and temperature in the bulk of the fluid phase. In addition, the reactor design determines the concentration/temperature profiles along the axial and radial reactor profiles.
These effects do not modify the true kinetics, only the apparent kinetics. In the electrocatalytic case, a closed electronic and ionic circuit is present. Thus, the mass and heat transfer limitations affect the overall behaviour, not only determining a different apparent and true kinetics. This issue differentiates thermal and electrocatalytic operations, although it not often clearly recognized in the literature.
Most of the studies on electrocatalysis operate in the presence of a liquid electrolyte, which may eventually be different for the anodic part (anolyte) and the cathodic part (catholyte). The two compartments are separated by a membrane, which can be protonic, anionic or bipolar. Although many studies still use very simple configurations (H-type of cells) with relatively distant electrodes and often batch-type operations, better-designed reactors minimize the electronic/ion transport resistance. This aspect is crucial to realize higher current densities. The number of studies on better-designed electrocatalytic reactors (continuous operations and better industrial scalability) is increasing.285,286,288,289
Although they are less used, operations without a liquid electrolyte are attracting increasing literature attention.290–295 In this type of electrocatalytic reactor, the closure of the electronic circuit is realized by the membrane acting as both an electrolyte and membrane to separate the anodic and cathodic sectors. The electrocatalysts are in contact with the two sides of the membrane. A GDE (gas diffusion electrode) allows the direct flow of the gaseous reactants (water vapour and CO2, for example) to the electrocatalyst. The components (membrane, electrocatalysts, conductive supports and gas diffusion layers) are joined by hot-pressing to form a membrane-electrode assembly (MEA). A compact system with the minimum distance between the electrodes has been realised, allowing easy scaling.296 This type of cell is known as a fuel cell.297 However, we earlier introduced their use for the electrocatalysis of CO2 and N2 reduction.293–295,298,299 The advantages of this type of cell are as follows: (i) the easier recovery of the products of the reaction, (ii) the elimination of issues related to bubble formation at the electrocatalyst surface, (iii) the higher surface concentration of the reactants at the electrocatalyst surface because the solubilization issues in the liquid electrolyte are avoided, (iv) the elimination of leaching of the electrocatalyst in the liquid electrolyte, (v) the avoidance of changes in the electrolyte (for example, by the accumulation of by-products), which can alter the stability, and (vi) the effortless industrial scalability. Alternatively, its drawbacks are the possible limitation of mass transport resistance across the membrane and the enhanced issues of cross-diffusion through the membrane.
From a mechanistic perspective, the operations with or without a bulk electrolyte drastically influence the surface concentration of adspecies and the conversion paths. However, this is an aspect that is typically neglected. It is often assumed that the surface paths of transformation are determined by the intrinsic properties of the electrocatalysts, which are not influenced by the coverage of adspecies. In typical theoretical methods such as DFT, the coverage by adspecies is an aspect that is not considered.
In CO2 electro-conversion, it has been proven that the formation of C2+ products, e.g., products with two or more carbon atoms, is determined by the concentration of surface adspecies.31,268,269,295,300–302 Based on the chemical kinetic simulations, Ling et al.303 found that Cu electrodes with surface nano-cavities exhibit CO enrichment (Fig. 10a), and the ratio of C2H4/CH4 increases with an increase in the number of cavities for CO2 reduction (Fig. 10b).

Typically, in the electroreduction of CO2, the formation of C2+ products is attributed to some specific metal such as copper, the presence of a particular nanoarchitecture,51,251,305,306 and the interface with the electrolyte.307–309 We showed that electrodes not based on copper, and usually not selective for C2+ products, can become selective when a sufficient concentration of CO2 adspecies is realized by designing specific GDE or gas-phase operations. This evidences that the surface concentration of adspecies during electrocatalytic operations, rather than only the characteristics of the electrocatalyst, determines the surface transformation paths. This is another aspect typically not considered in designing electrocatalysts, indicating the close link between the reactor and electrocatalyst design.
In a recent study employing in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry, it was shown that on the same electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction, the catalytic properties, and consequently the selectivity paths are determined mainly by transport limitations rather than only by the intrinsic properties of the electrocatalysts.217 The addition of polytetrafluoroethylene particles to the catalyst layer of a GDE electrode enhanced the hydrophobicity and further increased the CO2 concentration on the surface of the electrocatalyst, achieving higher CO2 reduction activity and affecting the product distribution (Fig. 10b and d).304
Thus, under relevant electrocatalytic conditions, the reactor and electrode design, which determines the mass transport and the relative amount of all reactants (CO2, H+, and electrons) at the electrocatalyst surface under working conditions, become the critical parameters to control even the reaction paths of transformation. However, most current studies only focus on the electrocatalyst design.
From thermal to electro-catalysis: is it just a problem of additional complexity?
In the previous section, we revealed the additional complexity on going from electrocatalysis to thermal catalysis. The aspects discussed are not exhaustive regarding the intrinsic differences. However, current design models still do not account for these aspects.
In thermal catalysis, different aspects play an important role in determining the catalytic behaviour, even if typically not considered in theoretical modelling. The following items can be cited: (i) the dynamics of the gas–solid interaction, (ii) the deviation from ideality of many practical catalysts, (iii) localized charges derived from redox reactions, and (iv) the presence of strain and other deviations from a crystalline arrangement. Thus, it may be indicated that a simplified approach is necessary for modelling thermal catalysis. Nevertheless, although the simplified approach provides valuable indications for the catalyst design and identification of the reaction mechanism, the question arises whether for the electrocatalysis case, id the same considerations would be valid. Specifically, is just a problem of additional complexity to account for the progressive better description of the mechanisms as in the case of thermal catalysis?
Although the design criteria and fundamental insights for thermal catalysis effectively predict how to tune the catalyst properties for further improvement, the same is still not valid for electrocatalysis. However, there are only a few specific studies in this direction in the literature. Centi and Perathoner38,310 analysed the electrocatalytic synthesis of ammonia from N2 on a relatively homogeneous set of carbon-based electrocatalysts. In this analysis, the literature results (current density versus faradaic efficiency) were compared to a range of target values indicated as necessary to meet industrial requirements and exploit the technology. Although it is often questioned in the literature whether ammonia is derived effectively from N2 rather than from other N-based impurities, these results were selected because they avoid this issue and provide detailed mechanistic modelling based on combining experimental and theoretical results. Thus, each article can be considered a detailed and throughout mechanistic study, emphasising the performance differences to the state-of-the-art. However, when all the results are analyzed from the perspective of requirements to industrial needs, the research results appear confined to a relatively narrow range of performances, far from the necessary targets. When the specific mechanistic data were analysed, over twenty different mechanistic indications on the nature of the active sites and reaction path were indicated. Thus, a set of catalysts with homogeneous characteristics results in relatively similar catalytic performances, while mechanistic studies prove the very different nature of the active sites.
Thus, the question is whether these methodologies to analyse the mechanistic features are reliable for describing electrocatalysis and identifying the proper design factors that allow the non-incremental change to meet the necessary targets. We used this example of a different electrocatalytic reaction because similar results for CO2 electrocatalytic methanation are unavailable. However, as discussed later, the literature data for this reaction also present a similar issue. They are consistent when analyzed alone, but when analyzed together, they show inconsistencies that question the validity of the approach.
Before discussing this fundamental question, a brief preliminary analysis of the performances and mechanistic indications of the electrocatalytic CO2 methanation is necessary. The aim is not to provide a complete state-of-the-art but to recall the relevant literature on the methodological aspects of studying this reaction.
Electrocatalytic CO2 methanation
The topic of CO2 catalytic conversion is quite popular, reaching about a thousand publications per year recently from about 100 a decade ago.311 Using as an index in the “Web of Science” (Clarivate) the keywords “catalytic CO2 conversion or reduction” for the year 2020 and article as document type, about 30% of the total papers (∼1200) is focused on electrocatalytic CO2 conversion. However, while ∼20% of the articles investigated catalytic CO2 methanation, only ∼1% of the electrocatalytic papers discussed electrocatalytic CO2 methanation. This result is a rough indication because it is limited to one year and uses specific keywords. However, it indicates that the electrocatalytic CO2 area is of growing relevance, while direct CO2 electrocatalytic methanation is still marginally investigated. The number of dedicated reviews is also limited,312,313 but one of the paths often discussed is related to CO2 electrocatalytic conversion.314–320 On the contrary, the topic of electrocatalytic CO2 methanation has been rarely addressed in reviews dealing with catalytic CO2 or CO methanation.7,321–323
The electrocatalysts for CO2 methanation are mainly copper based, even if different metals are also active in the reaction.324,325 The reason for this is that in the volcano plot of CO binding energy vs. partial current density or onset potential,324 copper shows the optimal combination of overall behaviour. Therefore, it shows the highest current density, which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of other metals.324 However, this is only valid for stepped sites and specific crystalline planes. There is often a drastic reconstruction during electrocatalysis not corresponding to a change in the behaviour as expected from these mechanistic indications.326 Sun et al.56 showed that hydroxide-derived copper (OH/Cu) electrodes are active in CO2 methanation. Copper phosphate nanosheets also offer high performances.327 Cu2+ rather than metallic copper (Cu0) was indicated to be the active element in CO2 electroreduction to methane.328 Copper single-atom catalysts for which the above mechanistic considerations are not valid, are also active in CO2 methanation.326,329,330 Guan et al.329 showed that four nitrogen atoms should coordinate with Cu single atoms to accelerate water dissociation to form *H species and stabilize the key intermediates toward CH4. Molecular modifiers on the Cu surface would also significantly accelerate the rate of CO2 electrocatalytic conversion to methane.325 Besides Cu, other transition metals, such as Rh and Ir porphyrin anchored to a nitrogen-doped carbon substrate, are active in the reaction.331 Alternatively, other authors noted that the behaviour in methane electrosynthesis is associated with reactor and electrode aspects rather than the nature of the electrocatalyst.332,333
Thus, the analysis of the literature results proves that the interpretation of the electrocatalytic results is more complex than the simplified interpretation of’the binding energies of the adsorbed species. These aspects will be further clarified in the following sections.
Part of the complexity in analyzing the results is that electrocatalytic tests are performed under very different conditions with various types of reactors, which drastically influence the performances, as commented above. Also, in thermal catalytic tests, the testing conditions are diverse, and thus their impact on electrocatalysis is much more considerable and significant. Thus, testing protocols with standardised performance metrics and devices in catalysis (both thermal and electrocatalytic) will be helpful and necessary.
However, defining unique metrics to compare thermal and electrocatalytic performances is almost impossible. Kinetic parameters, such as the activation energy and preexponential factor, have a different meaning in electrocatalysis than in thermal catalysis. Some aspects will be discussed later in the “a more disruptive approach to electrocatalytic modelling” section. The reaction conditions are also essentially different, but the critical aspects include expressing the reaction rate. In thermal catalysis, assuming the absence of diffusional limitations, the activity can be expressed per g of catalyst or making some assumption regarding the number of active sites, i.e., turnover number. In electrocatalysts, their behaviour, under significant experimental conditions, is determined by the diffusion of charge, ions and molecules. There is an inhomogeneous distribution of the potential and double electrical layer; thus, the local variability in the reaction rate and local changes in the pH also influence the reaction rates. More aspects will be discussed later, but these elements already show how the possibility of defining single metrics to compare thermal and electrocatalysis is very challenging.
Electrocatalytic CO2 methanation requires eight electrons and eight protons, as follows: CO2 + 8e− + 8H+ → CH4 + 2H2O(2)with the standard equilibrium potentials (E0) in aqueous solutions at 25 °C and 1 atm being E0 = 0.17 V versus RHE(3)where RHE indicates the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as the reference electrode. This process is multielectron reduction, requiring a high potential, typically above 2 V, while the thermodynamic potential is ∼1.1 V. Thus, large overpotentials are necessary to drive the reaction with enough rate at both the cathodic and anodic sides. By considering the side reaction of hydrogen formation always present on the cathodic side, as follows 2H+ + 2e− → H2(4)where E0 = 0 V versus RHE, it may be argued that selective electrocatalytic methanation is impossible. This question is common for other products of CO2 electroreduction (C2H4 and CH3OH), except those (CO, HCOOH) where only a two-electron reduction is present and having E0 < 0. Thus, based only on the classical thermodynamic theory of electrochemical reduction, it is almost impossible to achieve the selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to products different from CO or HCOOH, differently from what was experimentally observed.
To explain this apparent paradox, it is necessary to consider the combination of the nanostructure, local potential, mechanism of the reaction, and the density of adsorbed H+ on the electrocatalyst surface. It should be noted that this last aspect depends on the presence and type of electrolyte, mass transport limitations in H+ diffusion, and electrode characteristics. Often only some of these aspects are considered when discussing the selectivity control for the electrochemical CO2 reduction.
As an example, Vasileff et al.332 for copper electrocatalysts indicated based on DFT and in situ Raman spectroscopy data that the selectivity shifts from CO to formate generation as the Sn content in the Cu–Sn alloy catalyst increases, which is related to the shift in adsorption preference from the C-bound *COOH intermediate to the O-bound *OCHO intermediate. When Sn–Cu is created, the charge is redistributed from Sn to Cu, generating regions of localized positive charge on the Sn sites. These localized positive sites hinder the nucleophilic attack of the CO2 carbon, making *COOH adsorption (and the CO pathway) less favourable. However, copper is one of the metals active in CO2 electrocatalytic methanation or the formation of C2+ products.
How can this be realized based on the above-mentioned mechanistic indications? They are valid because both CO and HCOOH have a negative E0 with respect to side H2 formation (eqn (3)). Thus, other factors have to be considered in the design of effective electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic methanation.
The current density varies for each sample and depends on the operative conditions, but interesting values of up to 130 mA cm−2 have been reported.334 In terms of overall performances, it can be indicated that for high current densities above 100 mA cm−2, the best faradaic efficiencies (FE) to methane are around 60%, at a relatively low overpotential (but typically using expensive Ir-based anodes). Higher FEs were observed for lower current densities. Even if further improvements are necessary regarding the FE and current density, the current values indicate feasible industrial application. Further improvement requires a better mechanistic understanding to design improved electrocatalysts. From this perspective, Table 2 shows that for the same metal (copper), quite similar FEs were reported, despite the fact that very different mechanistic interpretations were given, as follows:

Generally, all these mechanistic indications were supported by DFT calculations, besides spectroscopic evidence. Thus, the question arises why very different and sometimes contradictory mechanistic interpretations, even sometimes by the same group, are given despite the relatively similar performances for a set of relatively homogeneous electrocatalysts.
This is a general situation emerging from the analysis of literature data and is not limited to that indicated in Table 2. Thus, a single data set is analyzed correctly, but a common mechanistic interpretation valid for all cases is missing when all the results are considered.
Considering these results, it is possible to analyze the mechanistic aspects and design criteria proposed for CO2 methanation electrocatalysts.312,342Fig. 11 summarizes the reaction network and some of the possible adsorbed intermediates in CO2 electrocatalytic methanation. Two types of selectivity issues determine the faradaic efficiency in the reaction path of CO2 electrocatalytic methanation. The first is related to the selectivity in reducing CO2 with respect to H2 molecule formation, which is favoured when the standard equilibrium potential for the reaction is positive, i.e., higher than that for the side formation of the H2 molecule. This occurs for multi-electron/proton processes higher than two. The second is the carbon selectivity, i.e., the selectivity in forming CH4 with respect to the other carbon products (CO, HCOOH, CH3OH, and C2+ products). Minimizing the side formation of H2 (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER) is typically the most critical issue. As introduced before, the problem is to understand which design parameters can determine a selective pathway when thermodynamically unfavoured.
 Fig. 11  Simplified reaction network and possible reaction intermediate in CO2 electrocatalytic methanation, with indications of the electron/protons involved in the reaction and whether the standard equilibrium potential (E0) is negative or positive with respect to RHE. 
In this case, the answer is kinetic control, which also considers the role of mass transfer, the surface concentration of H-adspecies and the electrode/reactor design given the points stated before. However, these aspects are often minimized or marginally considered, focusing primarily on the carbon-type intermediates on the electrocatalyst surface. It should be noted that surface mass transfer limitations are missing in theoretical mechanistic approaches.

Carbon surface intermediates in the CO2 electrocatalytic methanation. 
It is usually assumed that the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of electrocatalysts is a prerequisite for the subsequent CO2 reduction steps, although this is not well-proven. In classical electrochemical theory, electron transfer occurs without direct adsorption or contact with the reactant. The electron transfer rate is determined by the reorganization energy of the surrounding solvent and the ligating coordination sphere of the reactant (Marcus theory,344 further developed by Levich, Dogonadze and Kuznetsov345). However, when more electrons are involved in the formation of catalytic intermediates, the theory must be extended and modified,346 but at the same time, it becomes less capable of predicting the behaviour correctly, especially when multiple products are formed, as in the case of CO2 electrocatalytic methanation.
Alternatively, the one-electron transfer to CO2 forms a negatively charged species, which tends to move away from the negatively charged catalyst surface. Thus, adsorption on the catalyst is necessary to avoid this issue. However, how this is realized is still an open question. This aspect is particularly critical when the adsorption occurs before, after or simultaneously with the electron transfer, or instead through a concerted multi-electron transfer, and eventually proton-coupled transfer (PCET).347–351 Given that it is often considered that the CO2 adsorption step with the transfer of one electron is the rate-limiting step of the process,342 it is evident that a better understanding of these aspects and how the electrocatalyst can be designed to improve this step is necessary.
After CO2 electron transfer, the CO bond undergoes strong perturbation with a change from linear to bent geometry, which requires a large reorganizational energy consumption.352 However, this is true without considering the chemisorption on the catalyst. It is also often indicated342 that the low solubility of CO2 hinders its adsorption in the electrolyte,353 which is typically an aqueous solution. Although this can affect the current density, it is unclear why it should influence the carbon selectivity, if not the ratio between the use of electrons to reduce CO2 rather than to form molecular H2. Thus, avoiding the use of a liquid electrolyte in contact with the electrocatalyst, as commented before, should prevent or minimize this problem, but the experimental observation is that it changes the carbon selectivity rather than the side reaction of hydrogen formation. In addition, the experimental evidence is that by increasing the potential in the negative 1.1–1.3 V range, the FE to methane drastically increases, while it is reduced for other products such as ethylene and CO of HCOOH on different copper catalysts.353 Therefore, a more complex interpretation is necessary, including in terms of the role of the electrolyte.67,279,309,319
After one proton and one electron transfer, CO2 can be reduced to either the *OCHO or *COOH intermediate, where the symbol * indicates that they are adsorbed. Further reduction of *OCHO and *COOH leads to the formation of HCOO− and *CO, respectively. *CO could be further reduced to CH4 or undergo C–C coupling with another *CO to form C2H4 and C2H5OH. Fig. 2b summarizes this reaction mechanism, which was proposed by Ren et al.,350,353 although it is primarily based on previous indications and suggestions and in agreement with spectroscopic indications. Although not all authors fully agree regarding this scheme, it is generally accepted. However, some possible products, such as acetic and oxalic acids detected by other authors, are not considered.
The mechanism reported in Fig. 2b refers specifically to copper catalysts because it is often indicated that copper is the only metal electrode capable of forming C2+ products at reasonable rates given that *CO is optimally bonded to it (Cu resides near the top of the volcano plot354). However, as commented before, the C2+ path can be developed on different metal electrocatalysts by ensuring there is sufficient surface concentration of CO2 adspecies.31,268,269,295,300–302 In addition, the C2+ path and selectivity can be mainly controlled by regulating the mass transport.309
Thus, the question is whether the key to electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is tuning the catalyst properties to maximize the energy profile of the adsorbed species along the preferred path or whether other aspects determine the selectivity. It should be noted that often the aspects are interrelated because by changing the catalyst, many other aspects also vary, from the electronic conductivity to wettability, presence of a non-uniform electrical field and potential, etc.


Design criteria for CO2 electrocatalytic methanation. 
Based on the previous discussion, analysing the proposed design criteria for CO2 electrocatalytic methanation is now possible. Here, we refer to the criteria indicated by Zhao et al.,344 which are similar to that indicated by other authors for the same reaction312 or different products in CO2 electrocatalytic reduction.355,356
The main strategies indicated for catalyst design are the following:
1. Morphology engineering, e.g., modulating the morphology, surface roughness, size and shape of nanoparticles. For example, it is indicated that roughened Cu surfaces have abundant under-coordinated Cu sites, exhibiting stronger CO adsorption energies. Thus, they have a decreased ratio of adsorbed H to CO,357 leading to the preferential formation of oxygenates rather than hydrocarbons. However, for very high roughness, there is an enhanced formation of CH4 due to the enhanced formation of surface dimer and trimer clusters on the surface of catalysts, which can serve as active sites for the reduction of CO2 to CH4.357 By varying the shape and size, the density of low-coordination sites increases, with Cu nanocubes favouring C2H4 generation, while Cu octahedra form CH4 preferentially.358 However, nearly spherical Cu nanoparticles will not be suitable for forming CH4 according to this model, even showing similar electrocatalytic behaviour.340 Generally, this morphological engineering can interpret a single data set, but when applied to the whole set of results, for example, that summarized in Table 2, it shows severe limits.
2. Crystallographic facet engineering. This aspect has close relations with the previous design indication. Hori, the first to study CO2 electrocatalytic reduction, reported that Cu(100) facets favour C2H4 formation, the Cu(110) surfaces preferentially produce acetate and acetaldehyde, and Cu(111) facets favour CH4 generation.359 More recently, Wang et al.360 reported that high-energy (110) facets containing four-fold coordinated Cu atoms result in highly selective methane formation. Luo et al.361 showed by DFT that the Cu(111) facet favours COH* formation, through which methane is produced via *CH2 species, requiring a high overpotential (<−0.8 V vs. RHE). They also indicate that on Cu(100), a change in *CO coverage from low to high can trigger a switch from ethylene/ethanol to methane/ethylene by affecting the relative stability of CH*O and COH*. Besides some inconsistencies in the data (what is the active facet for methane formation and whether a high overpotential favours side reactions), the point is that using this design criterion cannot be analyzed with most of the data in Table 2, including the behaviour of SACs, which even provide a higher FE to methane.
3. Defect engineering. This is a popular design aspect in electrocatalysis.362,363 Defects can be localized or extended, where the latter occurs when twin boundaries or strain form. Tang et al.364 reported an FE of up to ∼60% in CO2 electroreduction on the twin boundary of copper. However, these ordered defects are limited with total current densities of a few mA cm−2. The twin boundary can also be enhanced by preparing specific nanomorphologies such as nanowires.365 However, the reported behaviour (FE of ∼55% at −1.25 V RHE) is not particularly remarkable, with current densities better than that reported by Tang et al.,364 although still generally low.
4. Preparation of multi-metallic nanoparticles. Alloying or generating multi-metallic nanoparticles is a classical method in catalysis to tube the electronic and adsorption properties of metal nanoparticles or introduce co-catalytic sites (surface hydroxyl groups, for example). Various bimetallic electrocatalysts, such as Cu in alloys with various noble metals (Pd, Au, Ag, and Pt), have been reported to enhance the FE to methane.66 Although, in general, alloying with a second metal promotes the FE to methane, the best performances are not better than that reported in Table 2, for example. The FE to CH4 reaches at the best 30–40% in Cu–Pd.366,367 In Au3Cu nanocubes, the FE toward CH4 formation is about 35%.368 Recently, there has been emphasis on heterostructures for CO2 electroreduction,369 but whether this is an effective direction to develop target electrocatalysis for CO2 methanation (with FE above 90% at current densities over 300–400 mA cm−2) still has to be to demonstrated.
In conclusion, looking at the mechanistic and design criteria for CO2 electrocatalytic methanation from a birds-eye perspective, e.g., not at the specific data but rather at the complete set of results, the current design approaches are not satisfactory. However, good performances paving the way to its application have already been reported. Thus, these mechanistic and design strategies have an intrinsic methodological issue, notwithstanding the progress in practice.
Thus, the initial question arises again whether the current approaches are an acceptable simplification of a complex phenomenon, e.g., still providing valid indications on how to improve the electrocatalyst. The reply emerging from the above discussion is that they are oversimplified, and thus do not correctly account for the critical determining elements. For example, DFT methods do not consider the effect of the applied potential, the role of the electrolyte, the in situ modifications during the electrocatalytic process, the low surface coverage, the presence of mass transfer limitations, etc. The previous discussion showed that the kinetics of mass surface diffusion determines the selective paths of transformation, an aspect not accounted for in current design models or by theoretical approaches.
Thus, efforts in this direction are necessary to design next-generation electrocatalytic processes based on a more straightforward identification of the key aspects differentiating them from thermal catalysis rather than using approaches taken from thermal catalysis without proper attention and consideration of the limitations of the methods.

A more disruptive approach to electrocatalysis modelling
The limits evidenced in current approaches suggest that even the fundamentals of catalysis for the design of electrocatalysts should be reconsidered. The fundamental basis of catalysis is related to the original Sabatier concept of optimal energy of interaction between chemisorbing molecules and interaction with the active sites exists. This concept leads to the identification of the maximum reaction rate as a function of the bond strength (or other descriptor parameters), e.g., the presence of a volcano plot (Sabatier principle). In a revised and extended version, this is the core of theoretical approaches to select the optimal catalysts and has also been widely used for electrocatalysis.370–372
The “volcano”-relationships for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction are a generally accepted phenomenology in electrochemistry. However, when there are complex multi-electron reactions with the possibility to form various products, such as in CO2 electrocatalytic conversion, relevant deviations are often observed.373
Competitive adsorption may lead to a positive feedback loop for the adsorption of intermediates, and the competitive adsorption of CO can further enhance the adsorption of CO on Cu. In contrast, the adsorption of CO on the surface of Mo will lead to more dominant H adsorption.374 Although the Sabatier principle as a central paradigm of thermal catalysis has never been disputed, at least for gas-phase reactions, its use as the main driving principle governing electrocatalytic reaction activity/selectivity trends should be used with care. Zeradjanin et al.375 commented that “the intuitive Sabatier principle as a paradigm of catalysis cannot be transferred from heterogeneous gas-phase catalysis to electrocatalysis in a straightforward manner due to the specific behaviour of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces.” However, its use is the common practice in studying CO2 electrocatalytic conversion, using different descriptors to analyse the trend of the catalytic behaviour.376
The basis for theoretical approaches is the use of DFT or related methods to estimate the energy profile for the conversion of CO2. In addition to the limitations already commented on before regarding the use of this method to describe electrocatalytic reactions, the central point is that the focus is on the energy of the chemisorbed intermediates and not on how to provide energy for the transformation. Employing DFT and related methods, the activation energies of individual reaction steps are calculated using a simplified model surface, typically not accounting for the presence of an electrolyte, a charged surface and a potential. In addition, the theoretical models do not account for surface coverage and dependence on transport limitations. Even the estimation of the pre-exponential factor has been almost completely ignored.260
In catalytic processes, the thermal energy usually provides sufficient energy to overcome the activation barrier by modulating the reaction temperature. However, electrocatalytic processes typically occur at room temperature. The conversion rate is usually negligible without applying external energy (the electrical potential). Thus, the energy is associated with the potential that generates localized charges. How do they transfer the energy to the incoming or adsorbed molecule? This occurs by coupled electron and energy transfer, sometimes coupled with proton transfer (PCET). The energy transfer should involve surface phonons (e.g., solid vibrations) because this is how a solid can transfer energy to an adsorbed molecule.377,378 In solid-state physics, a surface phonon is the quantum of a lattice vibration mode associated with a solid surface.379 The energy transfer occurs by coupling the solid phonons with molecule bond vibrations. This process can be described through extended models based on Langevin dynamics.380
Localized phonons are necessary to transfer energy to the chemisorbed molecules selectively; however, little attention has been given to their role in catalysis, particularly electrocatalysis to date. Phonons are localized at the point and extended defects,381,382 step edges, twin boundaries, etc., which are typically considered active sites. In addition, they are dependent on the nanostructure. Thus, all the classical elements interpreted as the active site and used to determine the energy profiles of transformation can break down the “propagating” modes of surface phonons and localize them, making them more selective and effective for energy transfer to the adsorbed molecule.383
Selectivity in energy transferring to the adsorbed molecule is the key to controlling the transformation pathway, which classical electrochemical theories or the current theoretical approaches cannot explain. It is the combination between a suitable energy profile and a selective mode of energy transfer, which makes it possible to control the selectivity in electrocatalytic reactions.
In addition, surface phonons interact with strong localized electrical fields, generating polaritons (hybrid particles made up of a photon strongly coupled to an electric dipole), which have been recently indicated to be involved in the chemoselective suppression and enhancement of reactive pathways for molecules whose high-frequency vibrational modes are strongly coupled with them.384,385
When excitons (charges) are present (as in reactive catalysis, i.e., photo-, electro-, and plasma-catalysis), the coupling between excitons and phonons markedly influences the local electrical field and transfer rate to molecules.386 Strong electron–phonon coupling results in the trapping of excitons by the lattice.387 This aspect is critical to realize multi-electron transfer in (electro)catalysis. Earlier we introduced388 the concept to realize simultaneous multi-electron transfer in electrocatalysis, which is the key to providing a low-activation and overpotential path in the electrocatalytic conversion of small molecules. Similar to that occurring in enzymes, it is necessary to form charged excitons (such as trions, i.e., e−h+e−),389 which should be stabilized at the defect sites by coupling with phonons/polarons. These charged excitons with two or more electrons in one bound state may act as electron-rich species to facilitate a multi-electron reduction process of molecular N2 or CO2. Sun et al.390 showed that trions or similar exciton species catalyze the photocatalytic reduction of N2 on ultrathin MoS2. As an n-type semiconductor, ultrathin MoS2 possesses lots of free electrons, which under solar light irradiation, are attracted by light-generated excitons (electron–hole pairs) to form charged excitons (trions). This interpretation is based on the results by Shang et al.,391 where localized electrons in oxygen vacancies are active to adsorb N2 by electron donation and tightly bound excitons can capture additional electrons to form charged excitons (such as trions). MoS2 is also used as an HER electrocatalyst, but the discussion here is related to its photocatalytic behaviour, and the type of active species is suggested to be involved in multielectron electron transfer. Thus, the two aspects are not related.
The coupling of plasmon and excitons is another possible mechanism to generate charged excitons. Surface plasmons are a collective electron oscillator along the interface between metal nanoparticles and a dielectric upon illumination. Plasmon–exciton coupling interaction has been indicated to be responsible for surface catalytic reactions.392 Lin et al.393 proposed a mechanism for plasmon–exciton co-driven surface catalytic redox reactions. Even if these aspects require a light-driven process, the previous discussion demonstrated how strong mechanistic analogies are present between photo- and electro-catalysis and plasma-catalysis.
The aspects discussed above are still mainly at the level of preliminary hypothesis because they are have not been investigated in the literature to date, where only scattered results exist, supporting the mechanistic indications proposed. Nevertheless, they offer a possible explanation and interpretation of why current modelling approaches are ineffective upon going from thermal to electrocatalysis and why electrocatalysis differs from electrochemistry.
These considerations offer an alternative key for designing advanced electrocatalysts, even if further studies are necessary to prove the mechanistic interpretations.
It is worth remembering that the same effect usually utilized to describe the active sites and mechanism in electrocatalysis can have an alternative explanation that considers the differences between thermal and electro-catalysis. Furthermore, the discussion also evidences that theoretical methods should be integrated with additional elements, particularly the mechanism to selectively provide the energy for the transition to describe the behaviour adequately.
In general, the catalytic performance of thermal catalysis depends on the adsorption and dissociation characteristics of the intrinsic structure of the catalyst. The heat (associated with the reaction temperature) provides the energy to overcome the activation barrier. However, the applied potential generates charges driving the catalytic transformation in electrocatalysis. Without applying the potential, the reaction virtually does not occur. An applied electric field directionally determines the transport of electrons/ions. The intrinsic adsorption and dissociation, local electric field, local concentration, and energy transfer process interact with each other, and thus it is difficult to simplify the model like thermal catalysis (Fig. 12). This is a problem that has been given increasing attention in the research on electrocatalytic mechanisms.

In conclusion, the discussion in this section further strengthens the previous indication that the difference between thermal and electro-catalysis is not only related to the higher level of complexity, requiring a different, specific approach, not just translated from thermal catalysis.
Conclusions, recommendations and outlook
In this tutorial review, we addressed the complexity of moving from thermal to electro-catalysis. The methanation reaction was used as an example to understand the key designing factors upon going from conventional thermal catalysis to the novel area of catalysis with direct use of renewable energy (electro-, photo- and plasma-catalysis) to electrify the chemical production. These three types of catalysis share common mechanism aspects determined by the presence of highly reactive species, which is different from thermal catalysis. However, for clarity, the discussion was limited to electrocatalysis.
The fundamental tutorial question addressed herein is related to whether the approaches used in thermal catalysis can be translated to electrocatalysis. Although this is common practice, no analysis has been made on whether this assumption is correct.
Emerging pieces of evidence indicate that the approaches should be different. However, a systematic analysis and discussion are absent in the literature because the fundamental differences are often not recognized.
Therefore, we chose, as a tutorial model, first to discuss the case of CO2 methanation on solid (thermal) catalysts, evidencing why the conventional approach (directly related to the old Sabatier concept of volcano rate of reaction), even if only partially considering the complexity of the catalytic events, is very useful as a catalyst design element.
Herein, initially we analysed a critical fundamental aspect of catalysis by solids, i.e., the competitive adsorption of key reactants and regulation strategies to promote the overall behaviour in thermal catalysts for CO2 methanation. We focused on this aspect because it provides a good tutorial to present how this is an excellent way to discuss the large variety of CO2 methanation catalysts reported in the literature and how to rationalize their behaviour. It also provides valuable indications for their design and improving their behaviour.
Then, the reader was guided to understand the differences between thermal and electro-catalysis and the complexity of the aspects necessary to include in modelling and designing next-generation electrocatalysts for CO2 methanation. As emerged from this discussion, it is not a question of only additional complexity, with the thermo-catalytic approaches still usable for the design of electrocatalysts. The mechanistic and design strategies used to date have an intrinsic methodological issue, notwithstanding the progress in practice. The kinetics of mass surface diffusion largely determines the selective paths of transformation, an aspect not considered in current design models or theoretical approaches. Thus, existing approaches are not an acceptable simplification of a complex phenomenon. They are oversimplified, not correctly accounting for the critical determining elements.
Approaching catalysis from the perspective of selectively transferring energy for the activation barriers, rather than only of the nature of the active sites and the energetic pathways of transformation (the current approach), is the alternative fundamental perspective indicated. Specifically, it is the role of surface phonons and how to selectively localize them and interact with charges.
These aspects are mainly at the level of preliminary hypotheses. However, they explain why current modelling approaches are ineffective when going from thermal to electrocatalysis and why electrocatalysis differs from electrochemistry. Based on this, new design criteria for electrocatalysts can be advanced.
Finally, it should be further noted that we have not discussed aspects related to defining better types of catalysts for thermal or electrocatalytic CO2 methanation or important aspects such as the stability of their performances. This because the scope of this perspective is not related to these aspects but rather to evidence that conceptually different approaches have to be used in developing these two classes of catalysis. Nevertheless, from a practical perspective, it must be commented that active and stable catalysts for thermal CO2 methanation exist, as also proven by pilot-scale experimentation.394–396 Although further improvements can be helpful, the limiting factor in realizing the industrial implementation of power-to-methane technology is not related to the need to improve the catalyst.
Alternatively, the electro-conversion of CO2 to CH4 is still in its infancy, with significant problems associated with its performance (current density, faradaic selectivity, and stability). Few experiments in electrocatalysis have demonstrated long-term stability under industrially relevant conditions, e.g., current densities in the range of 0.5–1.0 A cm−2. Thus, this area of electrocatalytic CO2 methanation requires developing better and more stable electrocatalysts, and electrocatalytic solutions are not yet proven at a pilot size, at least for publicly available results.
Finally, it is worth remembering that electrocatalysts are part of the electrodes and must be used as a dispersed component over a conductive substrate with a near-bidimensional structure. Alternatively, thermal catalysts are used as 3D pellets, with mechanical and porosity characteristics necessary for fixed or fluid bed operations. Thus, there are different mechanical requirements, although this question has been scarcely discussed.
In general, the key features, design strategies and requirements for implementation are different. However, as commented herein, the methodologies and approaches used in thermo-catalysis tend to be applied to electrocatalysis, for example, in theoretical modelling, without adequately considering the intrinsic differences between the two cases. Thus, better clarification of these aspects will be helpful, but the significant differences cannot be summarised through a few statements. Fig. 12 attempts to provide an indicative comparison.
In conclusion, this tutorial review aimed to present new perspectives and clues of interpretation for researchers to approach the area of electro-catalysts and accelerate the progress in this area to meet the requirements for electrified chemical production or producing energy vectors efficiently. The recommendation is that adequate progress in this area can be achieved only by understanding that electrocatalysis (photo- and plasma-catalysis) cannot be approached as an extension of thermal catalysis. Thus, new modelling, design criteria and experimental approaches are necessary.
