    , Accepted 4th July 2012First published on 6th July 2012AbstractThree solution-processable small molecules of DPPT, DPPSe and DPPTT were synthesized by Stille coupling through attaching donor units of thiophene (T), selenophene (Se) and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) to the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) core, respectively. Replacement of the T donors with the more polarized Se units results in a balance between the a and b direction packing and an obvious increase of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 1.90% to 2.33% with the increase of the short-circuit current (Isc) from 5.59 to 5.81 mA cm−2 and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) from 0.78 V to 0.86 under the small molecule/acceptor ratio of 3:1. However, introduction of the conjugation-enlarged TT groups (versus the T units) leads to a decrease of the PCE, down to 1.70%, with a significant decrease of the fill factor (FF) (38% versus 44%), due to its poor film-forming characteristics.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction small molecules solar cells (SM-SCs), due to the ease synthesis and purification, well-defined structure and defined molecular weight for the small molecules, are becoming a competitive alternative to polymeric solar cells (PSCs).1,2 However, power conversion efficiency (PCE) values reported for SM-SCs are commonly inferior to that of PSCs, presumably resulting from the limited conjugation, relatively weak light-harvesting ability, and poor film-forming characteristics.3 Current studies usually focus on either the synthesis of novel structures with proper energy levels and strong light-harvesting ability2 or the optimization of device fabrication techniques to improve their self-assembling (SA) properties.4–6 For example, a novel star-shaped molecule with triphenylamine as core unit, benzothiadiazole as the bridge and end-capped with oligothiophene exhibited a PCE as high as 4.3%.7 Moreover, PCE values of SM-SCs based on DTS(PTTh2)2 can be promoted from lower than 1% to as high as 6.7% after optimizations.8
From the molecular engineering point of view, not only the optoelectronic properties but also the SA properties of organic molecules can be manipulated by elaborate design of molecular structures, for example, by combining donor and acceptor units2,9–11 and by varying intermolecular interactions.12–15
Recently, solution processable DPP-based small molecules have been given considerable attention due to their strong light absorption, photochemical stability, and easy synthesis.16–21 Actually, D–A type small molecules with the DPP core as acceptor and with various end-capped donor units show PCE values in the range of 0.7%–4.4%.16,19,21 However, how and why the device performances of solar cells differ from each other so much is not well understood.
To this end, we selected DPP derivatives as the molecular models to investigate how the molecular structure manipulates the device performance through varying the intermolecular interactions. Three differently interactive donor units of thiophene (T), selenophene (Se), and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) were, respectively, attached onto the DPP core, forming three solution-processable small molecules of DPPT, DPPSe, and DPPTT (Scheme 1). Studies of the structure–property relationships indicate that the increased conjugation from T to TT imposes a negative effect on the device performances, while the enhanced polarity from T to Se improves the device performances compared to the benchmark molecule DPPT.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis of DPP-based small molecules
Synthetic routes toward DPPT, DPPSe and DPPTT are displayed in Scheme S1 (ESI†). Stille coupling between the tinated donor unit of T (2), Se (6) or TT (10) with the DPP core22 yields the final products, as shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†), which were purified by silica gel chromatography producing blue solids all with a high yield of more than 80% and was further recrystallized in dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol for purification of the molecules. The chemical structure was confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra, MALDI-TOF mass spectrum and elemental analysis. These three molecules have good solubility in common organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform, toluene and o-dichlorobenzene, which is significant in preparing solution processable bulk-heterojunction SM-SCs.
2.2. Optical properties

Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectra of the DPP core, DPPT, DPPSe and DPPTT in chloroform solutions (1 × 10−4 M). Introduction of the donors shows a strong red-shifted absorption band for all the compounds, due to the ICT (intramolecular charge transfer) from the terminal donors (T, Se, and TT) to the DPP core.19 This ICT absorption band is gradually red-shifted as the terminal donor is changed from T to Se and TT (Table S1, ESI†), agreeing well with the electron-rich nature of these three aromatics.
 Fig. 1  UV-Vis absorption spectra of DPPT, DPPSe and DPPTT in the chloroform solution with a concentration of 1 × 10−4 M (a) and in the spin-coated films (b). 

Fig. 1b shows the absorption spectra of the spin-coated films from the chloroform solutions of DPPT, DPPSe and DPPTT (1 mg mL−1). As compared to the solution spectrum, each compound exhibits a broader and bathochromic absorption for the ICT band, due to both the donor–acceptor (D–A) interactions and the extending π–π interactions caused by the strongest polarity of the amide groups in the DPP units.23 The absorption maximum (λamax per nm) in films exhibited a delicate red-shift from the benchmark DPPT (λamax = 597, 659 nm) to DPPSe (λamax = 606, 669 nm) and DPPTT (λamax = 617, 680 nm). The optical bandgap is estimated from the onset of the ICT absorption band, as 1.68, 1.66, and 1.59 eV, respectively, all closely related to the different electronic nature of Se and TT compared to T.
2.3. Electrochemical properties
From cyclic voltammogram (CV) tests, the oxidation onset potentials of DPPT, DPPSe and DPPTT are located at 0.66, 0.61, 0.58 V, respectively, while the onset of reduction potential all occurred at around −1.02 V (Fig. 2). According to the empirical equation of EHOMO/LUMO = −(Eonset(ox/re) + 4.40) eV,24,25 the LUMO energy levels were all around −3.38 eV, the HOMO energy levels slightly increased from −5.06 eV for DPPT to −5.01 eV for DPPSe and −4.98 eV for DPPTT, consistent with the electron-donating nature of T, Se and TT. Such depressed HOMOs are expected to obtain higher Voc values than P3HT (−4.76 eV).26 The electrochemical energy gap slightly decreases from DPPT (1.68 eV) to DPPSe (1.63 eV) and then DPPTT (1.60 eV), agreeing with the optical bandgap.

2.4. Hole mobility
The hole mobilities (μh) of the three DPP-based small molecules were measured by the space charge limit current (SCLC) method (ESI†),27–29 with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DPPT (DPPSe or DPPTT):PC61BM/Au. The μh was estimated to be 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 9.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DPPT, DPPSe, and DPPTT, respectively, according to the plots of ln(JL3/V2) vs. (V/L)0.5 in Fig. 3. Note that the relatively inferior hole mobility of DPPTT can be attributed to its poorer packing order in films in comparison to that of DPPT and DPPSe, which is further revealed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (vide post). Apparently, the hole mobilities are good enough for the applications of SM-SCs.

2.5. Photovoltaic properties
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using the DPP-based small molecules as the electron donor and PC61BM as the electron acceptor with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DPPT (DPPSe or DPPTT):PC61BM/Ca/Al. When fabricating the devices, the standard P3HT/PCBM device was also prepared as a reference. PCE values of the standard device are among the normal results reported in the literature (Fig. S1, ESI†),30 demonstrating that our device techniques are credible and the equipment operated normally in our laboratory.

Table 1 summarizes the device results with different donor–acceptor ratios of 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and 4:1. The best efficiency for each ratio was given and the efficiency averaged from 5 devices for each ratio was also given. For all ratios, the Voc was improved compared to that of P3HT (∼0.6 V), due to their highly depressed HOMOs with respect to that of P3HT (−4.76 eV).31

When the donor–acceptor ratio was 1:2, in which the PC61BM dominates in the blending film, the device performances were not satisfying, with Isc lower than 4.50 mA cm−2, FF below 40%, and PCE values around 1.0% for the three molecules. When the donor–acceptor ratio increases to 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1, the device performances improve gradually. The trend that the device performances improve as the donor ratio increases may be ascribed to the enhanced light absorption by the DPP-based dyes.
The best device was obtained when the donor–acceptor ratio is 2:1 for DPPTT/PC61BM, while for DPPT/PC61BM and DPPSe/PC61BM, the best results occurred at the donor–acceptor ratio of 3:1 (Fig. 4). Under these conditions, DPPT gave a PCE of 1.90% with an Isc of 5.59 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.78 V, and an FF of 44%. The device performances were improved by replacing the T units with the more polarized Se units: DPPSe showed a PCE of 2.33% with an increased Isc of 5.81 mA cm−2, an improved Voc of 0.86 V, and a comparable FF of 46%. However, when replacing the T units with the conjugation-enlarged TT groups, the PCE decreased down to 1.70% with a significant decrease of FF, down to 38%, as compared to 44%, while the Isc (5.74 mA cm−2) and Voc (0.78 V) were both comparable to that of DPPT.
 Fig. 4  The I–V curves of the best devices based on DPPT:PC61BM (3:1), DPPSe:PC61BM (3:1), and DPPTT:PC61BM (2:1). 
As the ratio of the donor and acceptor was further increased up to 4:1, the device performances decrease dramatically for all three molecules (Table 1). It is worth noting that the FF of the DPPTT is commonly inferior (<40%) for each ratio, which can be ascribable to the low packing order of DPPTT in films and infavorable film morphology, which will be proved in the XRD data and atomic force microscope (AFM) images (both vide post). Particularly, the FF of DPPSe reaches as high as 46% when the donor–acceptor ratio is 3:1, which is outstanding for SM-SCs.
To confirm the accuracy of the Isc measurements, the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the champion devices were tested (Fig. 5a) and the absorption spectra of the small molecule/PC61BM blending films prepared under the same conditions as those of the champion devices were also tested for comparison (Fig. 5b). The SM-SCs based on DPPT, DPPSe and DPPTT all exhibited broad photon response extending from 300 to 800 nm. Furthermore, the shape of EQE curves from 300 nm to 800 nm are similar to their absorption spectra, indicating that the absorbed photons contribute to the photovoltaic conversion. The maximum EQE are 37%, 36.5%, and 27.1% for DPPT/PC61BM, DPPSe/PC61BM, and DPPTT/PC61BM, respectively. The Isc calculated from the EQE are 5.25 mA cm−2 for DPPT, 5.40 mA cm−2 for DPPSe, and 5.31 mA cm−2 for DPPTT, respectively, which are consistent with the measured Isc.

As the performances of the solar cell devices were closely associated with the nano-morphology of the active layer, we investigated the film morphology of the pristine films and blending films by tapping mode AFM, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), and in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Tapping mode AFM images of DPPT/PC61BM (3:1, a), DPPSe/PC61BM (3:1, b), and DPPTT/PC61BM (2:1, c). Scan area: 5 × 5 μm, Rq (surface roughness) = 1.55 nm (a), 0.743 nm (b), and 4.44 nm (c). 

DPPT/PC61BM and DPPSe/PC61BM show smooth surface morphology with surface roughness (Rq) of 1.55 nm and 0.74 nm, which are similar to their pristine films as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). However, the pure DPPTT film and DPPTT/PC61BM blending films show relatively coarse surface with Rq = 6.15 and 4.44 nm, presumably due its relatively high crystallinity and poor film-forming characteristics. The film of DPPT/PC61BM and DPPSe/PC61BM both show nanoscale domains, whereas the DPPTT/PC61BM film shows macroscale phase separation with domain sizes of more than 100 nm. Those results are consistent with the low fill factor of DPPTT, which may be attributed to the strong intermolecular forces from the larger aromatic donor of TT and its poor film-forming characteristics.
2.6. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
In order to get insightful information for the molecular packing in the pristine films and the blend films with PC61BM, the XRD patterns of the pristine small molecule films and their blend films were measured for comparison (Fig. 7a and Table S2, ESI†). Three dominant packing orders are deduced for those molecules, namely, along the a, b, and c directions: The reflections at 4°–5° and 6°–7° corresponding to the interchain distance separated by the alkyl chains that attach to the donor units (a direction) and DPP core (b directions), respectively, and diffraction peaks at 20°–25° are assigned to the π–π stacking of the conjugated backbones (c direction) (Fig. 7b). In addition to those a, b, and c diffractions, there are also several weak reflections at 7°–20°, which can be ascribed to the higher order of a and b directions, indicating the long-range order of the DPP-based molecules.
 Fig. 7  XRD patterns of the pristine DPPT, DPPSe, DPPTT, and their blend films of DPPT:PC61BM (3:1), DPPSe:PC61BM (3:1), and DPPTT:PC61BM (2:1) (a) and packing model of the DPP-based small molecules in films (b). 
For the a and b direction packing, DPPT (a = 19.7 Å, b = 13.1 Å), DPPSe (a = 19.8 Å, b = 12.7 Å), and DPPTT (a = 18.2 Å, b = 13.0 Å) have rather similar packing distances, but significant intensity differences, indicating the different degree of order in the two directions for the three molecules. We summarized the relative intensity ratio of a reflection versus b reflection (Ia/Ib) (Table S2, ESI†). The benchmark molecule, DPPT, with thiophene as donor unit, exhibits a Ia/Ib value of 3.97, indicating the higher order of a than b direction. When the donor unit was switched to a more polar unit of selenophene, the Ia/Ib value changed to 2.89, indicating a relatively enhanced order in the b direction. However, when the donor unit was transformed into the larger conjugated unit TT, the diffraction intensity of the a direction was highly strengthened with respect to that of the b direction (Ia/Ib = 17.12). Interestingly, after blending with PC61BM, the relative order of the a and b direction was rather different to the pristine films, with Ia/Ib = 14.66, 3.51, 3.46 for DPPT/PC61BM, DPPSe/PC61BM, and DPPTT/PC61BM, respectively. Those results indicate that the degree of order in the a and b directions can be fine-tuned through varying the polarity and conjugation of the donor unit in DPP-based D–A type molecules. In our case, DPPSe exhibits well-balanced degree of order between the a and b directions compared to that of DPPT and DPPTT, for which we can expect better SA properties in film when applied in SM-SCs, which is consistent with the best device performance among these three molecules. It is worth noting that the intensity of the π–π reflection (c direction in Fig. 7b) of the three small molecules were rather weak and can almost be negligible compared to the a and b diffractions, indicating the weak π–π stacking of the three molecules.
Conclusions
Three solution-processable small molecules of DPPT, DPPSe, and DPPTT, with DPP core as acceptor and thiophene (T), selenophene (Se), and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) as the donor unit were synthesized. The device performances are finely tuned by the attached donor units. The SM-SC device made from DPPT/PC61BM with a donor–acceptor ratio of 3:1 gives rise to a PCE of 1.90%. The PCE is increased up to 2.33% for DPPSe/PC61BM with a donor–acceptor ratio of 3:1 with an increase of both the Isc and Voc, likely due to the more polarized Se units balancing the a and b direction packing, while it is decreased to 1.70% for DPPTT/PC61BM when the donor–acceptor ratio is 2:1 because the conjugation-enlarged TT groups weaken the film-forming characteristics. Accordingly, our results demonstrate that introduction of more polarized Se instead of the conjugation-enlarged TT may enhance the self-assembly properties of the small molecules and improve the photovoltaic performances.
