    , Accepted 15th October 2012First published on 17th October 2012AbstractTwo novel organic sensitizers containing a 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl unit are designed and synthesized. Under standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions, the JK-262 sensitized cell in conjunction with an aqueous electrolyte gave a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 3.78 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.68 V, and a fill factor of 0.82, affording an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 2.10%. The η of JK-262 is higher than that of JK-259 due to the larger Jsc. The improved Jsc value is attributable to the broad and red-shifted absorption band as well as the dense packing of JK-262 on the TiO2 film.
Introduction
The photovoltaic technology has been considered as an effective way to solve the current energy and environmental crisis.1 Dye-sensitized solar cells are attracting wide-spread interest for the conversion of sunlight into electricity because of their low cost and high efficiency.2 A typical DSSC consists of three main parts: dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, electrolyte with I−/I3− redox couple, and catalytic counter electrode. In these cells, the electrolyte is one of the key components for high power conversion efficiency. The use of organic volatile electrolytes and organic dyes as sensitizers in DSSCs is achieved a power conversion efficiency in the range of 8–10%.3 However, organic based electrolytes with volatility and flammability degrade the durability and safety of the cell.4 The best option for the electrolyte is to use water because water-based DSSCs are less expensive and environmentally benign. Since 1990, it has been generally accepted that the water present in the organic electrolyte of DSSCs is poisonous for efficient solar energy conversion.5 Therefore, water permeation on organic based DSSCs should be prevented by barrier layers.6 Recently, O'Regan and co-workers7 have shown that high water content in the electrolyte is not inseparably linked to poor efficiency and/or instability in DSSCs. So far, most of work on water-based electrolytes have centered on the ruthenium dyes.8 Recently, Spiccia and co-workers have described an aqueous dye-sensitized solar cell based on the Fe(CN)64−/3− redox couple using an organic sensitizer, showing a high conversion efficiency of 4.1%.9 This finding encouraged us to revisit the water-based DSSCs using the organic sensitizers in conjunction with aqueous electrolytes. In this work, we report water-based DSSCs using the organic sensitizers (JK-259 and JK-262) containing 4-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)phenylamine as the electron donor and cyanoacrylic acid as the electron acceptor bridged by the 9,9-bis(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)-9H-fluorenyl linker (Fig. 1). We introduced a 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl unit on an organic unit to increase water solubility.

Result and discussion

Scheme 1 illustrates the synthetic procedures of organic sensitizers (JK-259 and JK-262) starting from a 2-bromo-7-iodo-9H-fluorene 1. The 2-bromo-7-iodo-9,9-bis(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)-9H-fluorene 2 was synthesized by alkylation of 1 with 1-iodo-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethane in the presence of t-BuOK. N-Phenylation of 2 with bis(4-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)phenyl)amine was performed under Buchwald reaction.10 Compound 5 was prepared from 4 by a lithiation with 1.2 equiv. of n-butyllithium and subsequent quenching with DMF. The Heck reaction11 of 5 with vinylboronic acid pinacol ester led to 6. The attachment of 6 to 3 was achieved by the Suzuki coupling reaction.12 The Knoevenagel condensation13 of the aldehydes 7 and 9 with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of piperidine yielded the sensitizers JK-259 and JK-262.

Fig. 2 shows the electronic absorption and emission spectra of the JK-259 and JK-262 sensitizers measured in THF. The absorption spectrum of JK-259 exhibits an intense absorption peak at 418 nm (ε = 83400 dm3 mol−1 cm−1), which is due to the π–π* transition of the conjugate molecule. Obviously, the absorption coefficient is enhanced with the increase of the conjugation length. Under the same conditions, the JK-262 sensitizer with a 3,4-ethyldioxythiophenyl unit on the spacer framework exhibits a strong absorption band at 449 nm, which is 31 nm red-shifted relative to that of JK-259. The red-shift derives from the presence of an electron-rich 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophenyl unit14 and a small distortion angle with respect to the fluorenyl unit (24.4°). When the JK-259 and JK-262 sensitizers are excited within their π–π* band in an air-equilibrated solution at 298 K, the photoluminescence spectra of JK-259 and JK-262 exhibit strong luminescence maxima of 542 and 598 nm, respectively.

Electrochemical properties of the sensitizers JK-259 and JK-262 were scrutinized in acetonitrile with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate using TiO2 film with absorbed dyes as working electrodes. The two organic sensitizers adsorbed on a TiO2 film showed quasi-reversible couples. The oxidation potentials of JK-259 and JK-262 were measured to be 0.90 and 0.94 V vs. NHE, respectively. The high oxidation potential relative to that of the triiodide/iodide couple (+0.5 V) could lead to fast dye regeneration. The reduction potentials of two dyes calculated from the oxidation potentials and the E0–0 determined from the intersection of normalized absorption and emission spectra15 were calculated to be −1.78 and −1.46 V vs. NHE. Therefore, the downhill energy offset of the LUMO in the two dyes ensures an ample driving force for electron injection.16
The highest-occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of JK-259 and JK-262 were performed with the B3LYP/6-21G* (Fig. 3). The calculation reveals that the HOMO is delocalized over the π-conjugated system via the diphenylamino group through the fluorenyl unit and the LUMO is delocalized over the cyanoacrylic unit through fluorenyl and 3,4-ethyldioxythiophenyl groups. The examination of HOMO–LUMO illustrates that the photoinduced electron transfer from JK-259 or JK-262 dyes to TiO2 electrodes can efficiently occur by the HOMO–LUMO transition as shown in Fig. 3.

Table 1 demonstrates the device performance of two cells constructed with the addition of up to 100% water to the electrolyte. The electrolyte used in both cells consists of 2 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMMI), 0.05 M iodine, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN), and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in methoxypropionitrile (MPN). In order to prevent phase separation in the 100% water electrolyte, 1% Triton X-100 was added to the electrolytic solution.17 At water containing electrolyte in both dyes, TBP treatment on the TiO2 films improved the photovoltaic performance and stability. The sensitizers without any addition of TBP were easily decomposed. A large increase in Voc and Jsc occurred for both dyes when 0.5 M TBP was added into the electrolyte. A similar phenomenon was observed in organic electrolyte-based DSSCs.18 As shown in Table 1, the fill factor (ff) and open-circuit voltage in the water-containing electrolyte gradually increased with the incremental addition of water, but the short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) sharply decreased under the same conditions. The decrease of photocurrent may be contributable to the dye detachment,19 formation of iodates20 as well as decrease in electron lifetime.17

The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) with a sandwich type cell based on JK-259 and JK-262 is shown in Fig. 4. IPCE values higher than 20% were observed in the range of 370–470 nm with a maximum value of 26% at 455 nm for the device based on JK-259 in 100% water based electrolyte. Under the same conditions, the action spectrum of JK-262 is red-shifted by 100 nm compared to that of JK-259 due to an apparent red-shift in the absorption spectrum. Under standard global air mass 1.5 solar conditions, the JK-259 sensitized cell in 100% water containing electrolyte gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 2.28 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.66 V, and a fill factor (ff) of 0.79, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 1.16%. Under the same conditions, the JK-262 sensitized cell gave a Jsc of 3.78 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.68 V, and a ff of 0.82, corresponding to an η value of 2.10%, which is the highest one in the water based DSSCs with I−/I3− electrolytes. The increased fill factor upon the incremental addition of water may be attributable to the fast catalytic characteristic, resulting in the reduced resistance. For comparison, we fabricated the cell using the sensitizer with hydrophobic nature (JK-2). Upon the incremental addition of water, the efficiency was sharply dropped from 5.46% in no water electrolyte to 2.10% in 100% water electrolyte. Therefore, the molecular engineering of organic sensitizers with hydrophilic terminals demonstrates some advantage for aqueous electrolyte based DSSCs. From these results, we have observed that the η value of the JK-262 based cell is higher than that of the JK-259 based cell due to a large photocurrent. The large photocurrent in JK-262 relative to JK-259 originates from a broad and red-shifted absorption band (Fig. 2) and the dense packing of JK-262 on the TiO2 films. To check the effect of packing on both sensitizers, we measured the amount of dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 films by desorbing the dyes from the TiO2 surface with KOH. The amount of two dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 film were measured to be 7.01 × 10−6 and 8.84 × 10−6 mmol cm−2 for JK-259 and JK-262, respectively. The low adsorption of JK-259 may be attributable to the presence of two bulky (2-methoxy-ethoxy)ethyl units. The bulky sensitizer requires more space on the TiO2 surface and penetrates less easily in the small cavities of the TiO2 than the less hindered sensitizer. Therefore, the electron recombination can be facilitated along with the insufficient coverage on the TiO2 surface, resulting in the decrease in the τe value.21

Fig. 5 shows the lifetimes (τe) of the DSSCs employing W00 (no water) and W100 (100% water) for JK-259 and W00 and W100 for JK-262 displayed with a function of Jsc and Voc. The τe values show a big gap among the dyes, giving W00 of JK-262 > W00 of JK-259 > W100 of JK-262 > W100 of JK-259. The different τe values might be derived from the different dye structures. The τe values of JK-262 were longer than those of JK-259 due to the relatively poor dye adsorption on the TiO2 film. The electron recombination can be facilitated along with the insufficient coverage on the TiO2 surface for JK-259 dye, resulting in the decrease in the τe values.21 The result of the electron lifetime in both dyes is consistent with that of Voc shown in Table 1.

The electrocatalytic activity of CE in DSSCs can be conveniently evaluated by using symmetrical dummy cells, in which a thin layer of electrolyte solution is sandwiched between two identical electrodes.22–25Fig. 6a shows the Nyquist plots of the symmetrical dummy cells consisting of two Pt-coated FTO electrodes with different amounts of water in the electrolyte. The experimental data could be fitted into the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 6a, which is well known as a Randles-type circuit, where RS is ohmic serial resistance, RCT is charge transport resistance at the interface between electrode surface and electrolyte, ZD is the Nernst diffusion impedance in the bulk electrolyte solution between the two identical electrodes, and CPE is a constant phase element describing deviation from the ideal capacitance due to the surface roughness of the electrodes.26,27

(b) Electrochemical impedance spectra measured under the illumination (100 mW cm−2) for JK-262 employing different dyes (■ W00, ● W20, ▼ W60, ★ W100). 
The corresponding electrochemical parameters, obtained by fitting the plots with ZView software based on the equivalent circuit, are listed in Table 2. The resulted RCT values imply that the charge transfer resistance of the water-added dummy cells is decreased compared to that of the reference dummy cell, which is in agreement with the report by Sakaguchi et al. on quasi-solid state DSSCs with chemically cross-linked gelators.28 The RCT is an important parameter to evaluate the catalytic performance of counter electrode (CE) in DSSCs. It is because the exchange current density, J0 (i.e., the equal cathodic and anodic currents normalized to the projected electrode area at equilibrium), should be akin to photocurrent density on the TiO2 photoanode working under full sun illumination on a CE. The J0 varies inversely with the RCT.29 A lower RCT implies a more facile electron transfer from the CE to the I3− ions and, therefore, the Jsc of the DSSC increases relative to that of the reference DSSC. In fact, there is one report that Jsc increases with increasing water content, as a result of the decreased charge transfer resistance,30 in contrast to the decrease in Jsc noted in other reports.31,32Fig. 6b shows the Nyquist plots of the DSSCs at open circuit condition under 1 sun illumination. In typical EIS analysis, the RS of DSSCs is generally composed of at least three internal resistances. The semicircles in the different frequency regimes indicate the Nernst diffusion limited impedance of the redox species in the electrolyte, impedance by transport and recombination competition at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (RTR), and electrochemical charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface (RCT). The semicircle at the highest frequency regime in Fig. 6b is related to the CE/electrolyte event, and the RCT at the CE/electrolyte interface can be obtained from the real component values. As shown in Fig. 6b, RCT of the DSSCs with W60 and W100 is so active that cannot be fitted, but RCT of the DSSCs with W20 and W00 exhibits 6.8 and 6.1, respectively. The presence of water in the electrolyte solution increases its hydrophilicity and thus would facilitate the charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to the enhanced movement of the ionic species. The increased fill factor of the water added DSSCs except for the DSSC with W20 compared to that of the reference DSSC in Table 1 also supports this observation. It is known that the fill factor depends on the resistances of the photoanode, electrolyte and CE. The increase in the fill factor in the case of the cell with W60 and W100 is attributed to its lower charge transfer resistance, relative to that of the cell without water additives.

In contrast to the expectation based on the decrease in RCT as shown in Fig. 6a, however, the Jsc values of the water-added DSSCs were decreased compared to that of the DSSC with W00, as shown in Table 1. RTR of the intermediate frequency semicircles in the Nyquist plots for JK-262 decreased in the order of W100 (50.5 Ω) > W60 (46.2 Ω) > W20 (33.6 Ω) > W00 (22.1 Ω), indicating the improved charge generation and transport. This result is consistent with that of short circuit photocurrent shown in Table 1. In summary, we can conclude that the decrease in the Jsc values of the water-containing DSSCs in the electrolyte could be explained by the detachment of the adsorbed dye through the hydrolysis of the TiO2–water surface linkage.
Experimental
2-Bromo-7-iodo-9H-fluorene (1),33 1-iodo-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethane,34 and 7-bromo-2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxine-5-carbaldehyde35 were synthesized according to the procedures in the literatures.

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer. MALDI-TOF Mass spectrometry was performed using Voyager™ DE-STR, 4700 Proteomics. Optimized structures were calculated by TD-DFT using the B3LYP functional and the 6-21G* basis set. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies were determined using minimized singlet geometries to approximate the ground state. UV-vis data were measured using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2S UV-visible spectrometer. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin LS fluorescence spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using VersaSTAT 3 (Princeton Applied Research). Anhydrous acetonitrile was used as the solvent and 0.1 M of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate was used as the supporting electrolyte. TiO2 films stained with the sensitizers were used as working electrodes, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. The measurements were done using a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and ferrocenium/ferrocene redox couple was used as an internal reference.
Electron transport measurements
The electron lifetimes (τe) in the TiO2 photoelectrode were measured by the stepped light-induced transient measurements of photocurrent and voltage (SLIM-PCV).36–39 The transients were induced by a stepwise change in the laser intensity. A diode laser (λ = 635 nm) as a light source was modulated using a function generator. The initial laser intensity was constant 90 mW cm−2 and was attenuated up to approximately 10 mW cm−2 using a ND filter which was positioned at the front side of the fabricated samples (TiO2 film thickness = ca. 6 μm; active area = 0.04 cm2). The photocurrent and photovoltage transients were monitored using a digital oscilloscope through an amplifier. The τe value was determined by fitting a decay of photovoltage transient with exp(−t/τe).36 All experiments were conducted at room temperature.
Fabrication of cell
FTO glass plates (Pilkington TEC Glass-TEC 8, Solar 2.3 mm thickness) were cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, rinsed with water and ethanol. The FTO glass plates were immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 (aqueous) at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. A transparent nanocrystalline layer on the FTO glass plate was prepared by doctor blade printing TiO2 paste (Solaronix, Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) and then dried for 2 h at 25 °C. The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under an air flow at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and at 500 °C for 15 min. The thickness of the transparent layer was measured by using an Alpha-step 250 surface profilometer (Tencor Instruments, San Jose, CA), a paste for the scattering layer containing 400 nm sized anatase particles (CCIC, PST-400C) was deposited by doctor blade printing and then dried for 2 h at 25 °C. The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under an air flow at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and at 500 °C for 15 min. The resulting layer was composed of 20 μm thickness of transparent layer and 4 μm thickness of scattering layer. The TiO2 electrodes were treated again by TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 electrodes were immersed into the JK-259 and JK-262 (0.3 mM in acetonitrile:tert-butanol:ethanol = 2:1:1) and kept at room temperature for 16 h. The FTO plate (Pilkington TEC Glass-TEC 8, Solar 2.3 mm thickness) for counter electrodes cleaned with an ultrasonic bath in H2O, acetone and 0.1 M HCl aq., subsequently. Counter electrodes were prepared by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (2 mg of Pt in 1 mL of ethanol) on a FTO plate and heating at 400 °C for 15 min. The dye adsorbed TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sealed sandwich-type cell by heating at 80 °C with a hot-melt ionomer film (Surlyn SX 1170-25, Solaronix) as a spacer between the electrodes. A drop of electrolyte solution (2 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMMI), 0.05 M iodine, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN), 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in methoxypropionitrile (MPN) and water) was placed on the drilled hole in the counter electrode of the assembled cell and was driven into the cell via vacuum backfilling. Finally, the hole was sealed using additional Surlyn and a cover glass (0.1 mm thickness).

After stirring for 30 min, 1-iodo-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethane (5.43 g, 16.16 mmol) was added to the solution and stirred at RT for overnight. The resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified with silica column chromatography using ethyl acetate/CH2Cl2 (3:7) as eluent to obtain as viscous oil in 60% yield. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz, ppm): δ 2.36 (6H, t, J = 7.5 Hz), 2.75 (6H, t, J = 7.5 Hz), 3.18 (4H, m), 3.30 (10H, m), 7.39 (1H, d, J = 8.4 Hz), 5.31 (1H, br s), 6.82 (4H, d, J = 9.3 Hz), 6.91 (4H, d, J = 4.8 Hz). 7.46 (1H, dd, J = 8.1 Hz, J = 1.5 Hz), 7.51 (1H, d, J = 8.1 Hz), 7.53 (1H, d, J = 1.2 Hz), 7.67 (1H, dd, J = 7.8 Hz, J = 1.5 Hz), 7.74 (1H, d, J = 1.2 Hz). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 75 MHz, ppm): δ 39.45, 51.82, 59.02, 66.78, 69.93, 71.71, 93.07, 121.16, 121.19, 121.75, 126.64, 130.58, 132.55, 136.47, 138.36, 138.97, 150.61, 150.94.

Conclusions
We have meticulously designed and synthesized a new class of fluorenyl-bridged organic sensitizers for aqueous electrolytes. A solar-cell device based on the organic sensitizer JK-262 in conjunction with an aqueous electrolyte gave an overall conversion efficiency of 2.10%. The power conversion efficiency of the DSSCs based on the two sensitizers was shown to be sensitive to the bridged units. Using a water-based electrolyte, a greener process for DSSCs fabrication can be developed for the realization of environmentally benign dye solar cells.
