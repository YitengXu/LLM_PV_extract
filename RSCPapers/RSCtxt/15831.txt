    , Accepted 19th October 2015First published on 19th October 2015AbstractTwo new subporphyrins were synthesized for the first time from a β-substituted pyrrole i.e. 3,4-diethylpyrrole via pyridine-tri-N-(3,4-diethylpyrrolyl)borane as building blocks. These β-hexaethylsubporphyrins are true contracted congeners of β-octaethylporphyrin (OEP). While the meso-triphenyl derivative of hexaethylsubporphyrin could be synthesized by following the reported method, the meso-free analogue could only be synthesized by condensation with trioxane, in the presence of catalytic methanesulfonic acid. These contracted macrocycles display interesting absorption, and emission behaviour including substituent dependent S2 fluorescence owing to the presence of flexible electron donating ethyl groups at their β-positions. The optical response and ultrafast S2 state dynamics of these systems suggest that it may be possible to tune the properties of the subporphyrin to develop efficient systems for solar energy capture and conversion processes.
Introduction
Porphyrinoids are endowed with a very vast and rich chemistry. They have been used as a tool in almost every field of research, viz. mimicking photosynthesis,1 as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer,2 in catalysis,3 materials chemistry,4 as nonlinear optical materials,5 organic light emitting diodes (OLED),6 in dye sensitized solar cells7etc. In this regard, subporphyrin, a 14π aromatic macrocycle, has emerged as a true ring-contracted congener of porphyrin in the last one decade, since it has 3 pyrrole units symmetrically connected via three methine bridges. Its unique bowl-shaped structure and strong emission properties are of great interest to researchers. It was first synthesized as tribenzosubporphine (1) in 2006 by Osuka and coworkers from an isoindole derivative and boric acid as a template.8a Later, meso-aryl-substituted subporphyrins (2) were independently reported by Kobayashi et al. using tri-N-pyrrolylborane as the templating precursor.8b Soon, Osuka's group established pyridine-tri-N-pyrrolylborane (PPB) as a very robust precursor for the synthesis of meso-aryl-subporphyrins owing to its greater stability.9 Subsequently, a lot of development has been reported by the two groups, via substitution at the β-pyrrolic and/or the meso-positions,10 in addition to functionalization of the axial hydroxyl moiety.11 Interestingly, attempts to synthesize meso-alkylsubporphyrins directly through condensation of an alkyl aldehyde with PPB only resulted in failure; though these could be realized through an indirect method via reductive desulfurization of meso-trithienylsubporphyrins.12a Again very recently Chen and coworkers reported β-trifluoromethylsubporphyrins, from their corresponding bromo-derivatives.12b To the best of our knowledge, so far there is no report dealing with β-alkylated subporphyrins. This class of subporphyrins is of great importance as they can be considered as true lower homologues of octaethylporphyrin (OEP), which has been studied widely, owing to its greater resemblance to naturally occurring porphyrins.13 Hence, it became intriguing to us to check the feasibility of their synthesis. Herein, we wish to report the synthesis of β-hexaethylsubporphyrin and its meso-triphenyl analogue using pyridine-tri-N-(3,4-diethylpyrrolyl)borane (PDePB) as the building block, which in turn was synthesized from 3,4-diethylpyrrole. The dual emission of subporphyrin 5 and femtosecond dynamics of its S2 state are also presented.  
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthesis of hexaethyltriphenylsubporphyrin (HETSubP) 4 and hexaethylsubporphyrin (HESubP) 5 started with the synthesis of precursor 6, the centrally boron coordinated PDePB, which is key to achieving our targets. It was synthesized with a slight modification of the literature procedure for PPB (Scheme 1).10a Freshly distilled 3,4-diethylpyrrole and the borane-triethylamine complex were heated at 100 °C for 1 h to obtain a pure white solid. After removal of liberated triethylamine and drying the solid, the product was again dissolved in excess dry pyridine to yield a reddish black solution. Subsequently, removal of pyridine and drying of the product provided the desired PDePB 6 as a reddish black semi-solid, as confirmed by HRMS (peak at m/z = 401.3122 which indicates the detachment of pyridine from the borane complex) and NMR data. Further purification of this complex could not be achieved due to decomposition of this compound during the purification process. Condensation of this precursor with banzaldehyde in 1,2-dichlorobenzene with TFA following the literature conditions9 afforded the desired HETSubP 4 in 8% yield. However, for the synthesis of HESubP 5, the above said conditions failed to yield the desired product; hence we had to alter the synthetic scheme. Paraformaldehyde (generally chosen for the release of formaldehyde) did not give the desired subporphyrin at 0 °C and on the other hand, heating at 150 °C resulted in the formation of OEP only. Fortunately, condensation with 1,3,5-trioxane led to the desired product. Among the several acid catalysts (trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulphonic acid, HCl, propionic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid) screened, methanesulphonic acid was found to facilitate the product formation. Further, temperature also plays a crucial factor since reactions at 0 °C and at room temperature did not lead to the formation of subporphyrin. The reaction was only feasible at higher temperatures, since trioxane breaks into its monomers and possibly immediately takes the reaction forward. Hence the best condition for the synthesis of 5 was found to be the addition of PDePB and trioxane in o-dichlorobenzene at 150 °C followed by an acid catalyst and heating for 2 h under a N2 atmosphere followed by quenching with pyridine and aerial oxidation by refluxing for 1 h (5%). Purification of the subporphyrins is generally tedious and repeated column chromatography only affords the pure products and possibly is the main reason for the low yields.

HRMS and NMR analysis
Both subporphyrins 4 and 5 show very intense HRMS mass peaks at m/z = 638.3711 (calcd for C45H45BN3 = 638.3707 [4-OMe]+) and at 410.2764 (calc. for C27H33BN3 = 410.2768 [5-OMe]+), respectively due to borenium cation [M−OMe]+ generation, owing to elimination of the methoxy group during the ionization process. Both subporphyrins are fully characterized by 1H, 13C, 11B and COSY NMR, which confirm their non-planar bowl shape structure. 1H NMR spectra of both subporphyrins are simple in CDCl3 and consistent with the C3v symmetry of the macrocycles. For example, the 1H NMR spectrum of 4 shows phenyl protons resonating at 8.29 (p-), 7.65 (m-) and 7.47 (o-) ppm at room temperature, and that of ethyl and methoxy protons was found at 2.63, 1.05 and 0.68 ppm. Both phenyl and ethyl signals appear to broaden without showing the desired splitting pattern, probably owing to their close proximity, which inhibits the free rotation of phenyl groups and hence delays the relaxation. A low temperature proton NMR experiment performed in CDCl3 displays splitting of o-CH protons (into two peaks at −50 °C) due to the restricted motion of phenyl rings owing to the flanking ethyl groups (Fig. 1). A similar type of splitting was earlier reported only when highly bulky aryl derivatives (2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl) were present at meso-positions of subporphyrin.9 On the other hand, the 1H NMR spectrum of 5 displays a free meso-proton at 8.62 ppm (as a singlet) and ethyl peaks at 3.30 and 1.57 ppm. Interestingly, the methoxy peak resonates at 0.08 ppm. The methoxy peak in 1H NMR was confirmed by the MeOH-d4 exchange and the carbon attached was assigned by 1H–13C COSY NMR, (ESI, Fig. S3, S10†) and B–OH (of the corresponding hydroxo-derivative) resonates at −2.83 ppm. These peaks are much upfield shifted, in contrast to the –OMe and –OH of other subporphyrins.8a,14 This clearly indicates the increased diamagnetic ring current due to the presence of electron rich β-ethyl groups at the macrocycle periphery. Further, the meso-protons were also found to be much more upfield shifted compared to the analogous tribenzosubporphyrin, which can be attributed to the presence of six electron donating ethyl groups at β-pyrrolic positions, hence increasing the diatropic ring current of the macrocycle. All the peaks are well resolved even at room temperature, which clearly shows the absence of any steric constraint in the molecule. Similar trends were also observed in 13C NMR spectroscopy; for example, in the case of 4, the spectrum shows a splitting of the ortho and meta phenyl carbons and was assigned by a 1H–13C COSY NMR experiment (Fig. 2, ESI, Fig. S11†). On the other hand, the 13C NMR spectrum for 5 is quite simple with signals at 18.7 and 17.4 ppm for ethyl groups and at 1.0 ppm for methoxy carbon, whereas meso carbon resonates at 98.3 ppm and two quaternary carbons of pyrrole appear at 141.7 and 133.4 ppm. The boron resonances for 4 and 5 were found at −17.1 and −15.6 ppm, respectively, in 11B NMR spectra.

Crystallography
A single crystal of 4 suitable for X-ray analysis was grown by slow diffusion of methanol into its CHCl3 solution. Owing to its greater solubility subporphyrin 5 crystals suitable for diffraction could only be obtained upon exchanging the axial methoxy ligand with 3,5-dinitrobenzyloxy (DN) and slow diffusion of hexane into its ether solution.12a The crystal structures obtained clearly show a triangular bowl shape for both 4 and 5·DN (Fig. 3). In the case of 4 four ethyl groups on two pyrrole moieties are directed towards the convex side, whereas the other two ethyl groups on the third pyrrole unit are disposed towards the concave side of the subporphyrin core. Interestingly in 5·DN all the ethyl groups are oriented towards the convex surface. The distance of the B-atom from the plane defined by six β-carbon atoms, also defines the bowl depth of the macrocycle, and is 1.16 and 1.430 Å for 4 and 5·DN, respectively. While the bowl depth of the former is similar to that of 3 (1.18 Å),15 in the case of the latter it is even deeper than the corresponding DN complex of meso-trialkylsubporphyrin (1.37 Å).12a The packing diagram (ESI, Fig. S12†) clearly indicates strong π–π stacking interactions between the DN of one macrocycle with the neighbouring subporphyrin moiety, along with favorable hydrophobic interactions between the alkyl side chains, possibly the reason for their all away of ethyl groups. This trend was also noticed in the case of the meso-trialkyl analogue.12a The B–O bond lengths are 1.45 and 1.50 Å for 4 and 5·DN, respectively and the corresponding three B–N bonds are 1.49, 1.492 and 1.486 Å for 4 and 1.49, 1.51 and 1.537 Å for 5·DN. Further, in 5 the phenyl rings possess a close to orthogonal orientation w.r.t. the subporphyrin core, with dihedral angles of 71°, 82° and 87°. This can be attributed to the steric repulsion between meso-phenyl rings and the flanking ethyl groups at the β-pyrrolic positions.

Photophysical properties
Subporphyrin 4 and 5 show Soret bands at 360 and 339 nm with corresponding shoulders at 341 and 325 nm, respectively (Fig. 4). Further, Q bands are observed at 448 and 471 nm for 4 and at 437 and 463 nm for 5. All bands are blue-shifted compared to 1,8a28b and 3.12 This can be attributed to the presence of electron rich alkyl substituents at the β-pyrrolic positions. Further, in the case of 4, additional steric interaction between the meso-phenyl rings and the β-alkyl substituents reduces effective conjugation (and hence the vibronic coupling) of the former with the subporphyrin core as evident from the large dihedral angles. Interestingly, the absorption patterns of 4 and 5 are very similar to those of the corresponding ZnOEP analogues except that the red shift in the absorption maximum of the subporphyrins is relatively much less upon introduction of the phenyl moieties.16 This can be attributed to greater core ruffling in the case of the porphyrin analogue in addition to its larger aromatic core. It is noteworthy that the effect of phenyl groups is more pronounced on the Soret bands compared to the Q bands in subporphyrins (a red shift of 21 vs. 8 nm) unlike that in porphyrins (a red shift of 52 vs. 68 nm).16b Steady-state fluorescence spectra of 4 and 5 display clear vibronic structures with peaks at 477 and 507 nm, and 469, 481 and 496 nm, respectively (Fig. 4). The fluorescence spectra are the mirror images of their corresponding Q-bands in absorption spectra. Small Stokes shifts indicate the structural rigidity in these subporphyrins. The fluorescence quantum yields for 4 and 5 determined as 0.20 and 0.12, respectively, are considerably higher than those of the corresponding meso-alkylated subporphyrin (0.07).12a These fluorescence quantum yield values are in agreement with the fluorescence lifetimes of 4 and 5, 4.68 and 2.19 ns (ESI, Fig. S14†), respectively, measured by the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique. This indicates that the β-alkyl substituents have greater degrees of freedom in 5 than 4, owing to the presence of the phenyl moieties at the meso-positions of the latter, thereby possibly enhancing the rate of non-radiative decay of its singlet excited state.

Excited state dynamics
While porphyrins and their metallo-derivatives belong to a rare class of molecules displaying dual fluorescence from both first and second excited states thus providing a great opportunity to researchers to probe their higher excited state dynamics,18,19 very recently meso-triphenylsubporphyrins have also made an entry into this class.20 Our initial studies reveal, interestingly, that the meso-triphenyl analogue 4 does not show any discernible S2 emission, whereas, 5 displays a distinctly observable S2 emission, upon excitation at its Soret band (Fig. 5a). In order to disentangle the S2 and S1 state dynamics we have performed femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption (TA) measurements on 5.‡ The TA spectra, recorded by exciting both the Soret (325 nm) and Q bands (465 nm), consist of broad excited-state absorption (ESA) in the 350–450 and 525–600 nm regions and bleaching (negative absorption) in the 450–525 nm region (Fig. 5).17–19 The bleach is the consequence of both ground state (Q-band) absorption and emission contributions (Fig. 5b). Even though the spectral features for both excitations are quite similar, the temporal behaviour shows interesting differences. For example, for the 325 nm Soret band excitation, the temporal profile of the TA monitored at 400 nm consists of an ultrafast 265 ± 12 fs decay component and a very long-lived component, which shows hardly any decay in 1 ns (the longest time that we could monitor), for the 465 nm Q-band excitation, the ultrafast decay component is completely absent; it is only the long lived species that could be observed.19 The long-lived TA component is clearly due to ESA from the S1 and T1 states.18,19 The ultrafast decay component, which is observable only for Soret band excitation, is assigned to the decay of the S2 state, thus representing its lifetime. The S2 state lifetime of ∼265 fs is further confirmed by comparing the time-dependence of the TA signal above 520 nm, where there is no TA contribution due to the S2 state. At 550 nm, the ESA shows a time-dependent growth with a lifetime of 267 ± 30 fs only for the 325 nm excitation (Fig. 6). This time evolution of the TA signal clearly reflects the formation of the S1 state from the S2 state. A very similar time constant for the decay of the TA signal at 400 nm and growth at 550 nm unambiguously establishes the S2 state lifetime of ∼265 fs. This value is comparable with that reported for the meso-arylsubporphyrins,20a whereas, it is much higher than that reported for ZnOEP (<30 fs).20b The demonstration that the S2 state participates in a radiative process, implies that it can also be made to take part in the electron transfer process as well and help enhance the energy conversion efficiency of a solar cell.

Molecular orbital calculations
To obtain further insight into the electronic properties of these subporphyrins 4 and 5, quantum mechanical calculations were performed with Gaussian 09 program.21 Transition energy along with oscillator strength were calculated by TDDFT. The nature of HOMO and HOMO−1 in the cases of 4 and 5 (Fig. 7) is the same as that of 1 and 3, however, in 5, the HOMO (−5.32 eV) is relatively more stabilized than that of 1 (HOMO: −4.89 eV).8a
 Fig. 7  MO diagrams of 4 (left) and 5 (right) calculated with the Gaussian 09 package. 
Further, LUMO and LUMO+1 in 5 are almost degenerate (−1.81 and −1.83 eV, respectively). On the other hand, substitution with phenyl groups at the meso position in 5 led to a rise in the energy levels of both HOMO and HOMO−1 in 4, making them almost degenerate (−5.18 and −5.19 ev), an attribute not reported so far in subporphyrins (Fig. 7). Similarly, LUMO and LUMO+1 also lifted up in energy and they remain almost degenerate. In the cases of 4 and 5 HOMO, HOMO−1, LUMO and LUMO+1 show large electronic coefficients at the meso position but since the meso position is free in 5, there is no contribution from the meso group and the subporphyrin core is the only contributor to the electronic properties. In the case of 4, owing to large dihedral angles, as a result of steric constraints, phenyl rings are not able to communicate much with the subporphyrin core. Hence there is a blue shift of bands in its absorption spectrum as compared to the other known nona-substituted subporphyrins.11a,14
Cyclic voltammetry
Electrochemical properties of these subporphyrins were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) using tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte in dichloromethane. 4 shows a quasi-reversible first oxidation potential at 0.59 V and a second irreversible one at 1.24 V (DPV), whereas, 5 shows the first reversible oxidation potential at 0.62 V (Fig. 8) and the second irreversible at 1.19 V (DPV). The absence of reduction wave (up to −2.0 V), complies well with the electron rich character of these subporphyrins owing to the presence of six electron donating β-ethyl groups.

Conclusions
In conclusion, unlike meso-alkylsubporphyrins, β-alkylated subporphyrins namely, β-hexaethylsubporphyrin and its meso-triphenyl analogue were synthesized directly via acid catalysed condensation of pyridine-tri-N-(3,4-diethylpyrrolyl)borane with trioxane and benzaldehyde, respectively, as a new class of electron rich subporphyrins. These subporphyrins, owing to six ethyl groups at their β-positions are electron rich in nature and hence, display increased diamagnetic ring current. The effect of substituents is further evident with the introduction of phenyl moieties leading to a substantial red shift in the Soret band than the Q bands of the subporphyrin. This is further reflected in the excited state dynamics of the hexaethylsubporphyrins, which is not observed in meso-triaryl analogues. It further highlights how subporphyrin demonstrates a remarkable tunability of its electronic, optical and excited state properties.
Experimental section
Instrumentation and reagents
All reagents and solvents were of commercial reagent grade and were used without further purification except where noted. Dichloromethane (DCM) was distilled over CaH2 for spectroscopic studies. Pyridine was dried over NaOH and distilled prior to use. Silica gel (100–200 mess) and neutral alumina used for column chromatography were purchased from Merck. 1H, 13C, 11B and all two dimensional NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 400 MHz and 500 MHz FT NMR spectrometers at room temperature and at low temperatures. Chemical shifts were reported in ppm w.r.t. the internal standard (CHCl3δ = 7.26 for 1H and 77.16 for 13C) and with BF3·OEt2 as the external standard in CDCl3 (δ = 0.00 ppm for 11B) on the δ scale. HRMS analysis was performed on Bruker maxis (ESI-TOF). UV-Visible spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 UV-Visible spectrometer. Fluorescence was recorded on a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements were performed on a Zahner Zennium Electrochemical workstation. All measurements were performed in DCM under a flow of nitrogen and 0.1 M TBAPF6 was used as the supporting electrolyte. A combination of three electrodes viz. Ag/AgCl in 1(M) KCl (reference electrode), platinum disc (working electrode) and platinum wire (counter electrode) was used. Ferrocene/ferrocenium Fc/Fc+ (0.48 V vs. Ag/AgCl) couple was used as the external reference for calibration. The redox potentials were referenced vs. Fc/Fc+. All CV experiments were performed at a 50 mV s−1 scan rate. Time-resolved fluorescence decay profiles of the S1 state of 4 and 5 were measured by using a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon IBH).22 A detailed description of the femtosecond laser set up for transient absorption (TA) measurements has been reported earlier.23 All the TA data were chirp-corrected for the group velocity dispersion of the white light continuum by using the ΔA signals of neat ethanol. Adjustable neutral density filters were used to attenuate the incident excitation beam before the rotating sample cell (path length of 1 mm) to ensure a linear pump power dependence of the signal. The pump–probe cross correlation was around (80–90) fs.

Synthesis of 6. 
Borane-triethylamine complex (800 μL, 5.4 mmol) and freshly distilled 3,4-diethylpyrrole (2.0 mL, 16.3 mmol) were placed in a pre-dried oven and cooled under a N2 atmosphere in a two-neck round bottom flask (R. B.) connected to a receiving R. B. and heated at 100 °C for 1 h in the dark. The temperature was elevated to 160 °C to remove the generated triethylamine, which led to the formation of a white colored solid. The reaction mixture was dried under vacuum and dissolved by stirring vigorously in pyridine (5.0 mL) under a N2 atmosphere at about 100 °C. Upon complete dissolution, heating was stopped and excess pyridine was removed in vacuo and a pasty solid was obtained, which was further dried under vacuum to obtain the desired compound 6 as a brown jelly material (2.38 g, 96%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) 8.56 (s, 2H, Py–o-CH), 7.8 (t, J = 8 Hz, 1H, Py–p-CH), 7.38 (t, J = 8 Hz, 2H, Py–m-CH), 6.55 (s, 6H, py–α-CH), 2.51 (m, 12H, –CH3CH2), 1.24 (m, 18H, –CH3CH2). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) 148.52, 139.11, 125.82, 124.56, 121.11, 114.55, 18.83, 14.88. HR-ESI-MS m/z = 401.3122 (calcd for C24H36BN3Na = 401.2900 [M − Py + 1 + Na]+).


Synthesis of 4. 
To a solution of pyridine-tri-N-(3,4-diethylpyrrolyl)borane 6 (1.0 g, 2.19 mmol) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (100 mL) was added benzaldehyde (2.1 mL, 20.0 mmol) and the reaction mixture was cooled at 0 °C in an ice bath. Trifluoroacetic acid (180.0 μL) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. TFA was quenched by addition of pyridine (200 μL) and the resulting solution was refluxed under aerobic conditions for 1 h. After the solution was cooled to room temperature, the solvent was removed in vacuo. To the resulting tar, 50.0 mL THF/MeOH (1:1) was added and heated to reflux for 15 min. The solvent was removed in vacuo and dried. The black tar was loaded on a silica gel column and eluted with MeOH/CHCl3 (1:4) to obtain a crude material. Repeating column chromatography 2–3 times led to the desired subporphyrin after octaethyltetraphenylporphyrin. Final purification was done on neutral alumina (EtOAc/hexane 2:3) and the pure compound was eluted as a yellowish colored solution with green fluorescence. After removing the solvent, the compound was again loaded on a thin pad of silica gel column and eluted first with HPLC grade hexane (100 mL) and then with HPLC grade CHCl3 to obtain the NMR grade pure product 4 as a greenish yellow solid (125 mg, 8%). Single crystals for X-ray diffraction analysis were grown from CHCl3/MeOH. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) 8.29 (br s, 3H, p-ph), 7.65 (br s, 6H, o-ph), 7.47 (br s, 6H, m-ph), 2.63 (br s, 12H, –CH3CH2), 1.05 (br s, 18H, –CH3CH2), 0.68 (s, 3H, –OCH3). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) 138.2, 137.8, 135.9, 132.8, 132.0, 128.4, 127.3, 126.9, 46.9, 19.2, 17.1. 11B NMR (128 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) −17.1. HR-ESI-MS m/z = 638.3711 (calcd for C45H45BN3 = 638.3707 [M − OMe]+). UV-Vis (in CHCl3) λ [nm] (ε [M−1 cm−1]) 341 (87296), 360 (116596), 448 (8719), 471 (5892). Fluorescence (in CHCl3, λex = 360 nm) λmax [nm] 477, 507; ΦF = 0.20.


Synthesis of 5. 
Complex 6 (600 mg, 1.32 mmol) was added to a solution of 1,3,5-trioxane (304 mg, 3.37 mmol) in dichlorobenzene at 150 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Methanesulphonic acid was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h. Pyridine was added to quench the acid and the reaction mixture was heated again at 100 °C for 1 h under aerobic conditions. The reaction mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and the solvent was removed in vacuo. To the black tar THF/MeOH was added and heated at 50 °C for 30 min. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the crude product was dried. The black tar was loaded on silica gel and eluted with MeOH/CHCl3 (1:4) to obtain crude subporphyrin. Repeating the column chromatography 2–3 times afforded the desired subporphyrin after octaethylporphyrin. Final purification was done by passing the subporphyrin through neutral alumina (EtOAc/hexane 2:3) and the pure compound was obtained as a yellow solid with green fluorescence. After drying, the compound was again passed through a thin pad of silica gel by HPLC grade hexane followed by HPLC grade CHCl3 to yield the NMR grade pure compound 5 (27 mg, 5%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) 8.63 (s, 3H, –meso), 3.31 (m, 12H, –CH3CH2), 1.58 (t, J = 8 Hz 18H, –CH3CH2), 0.08 (s, 3H, –OCH3). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) 141.7, 133.4, 98.3, 18.7, 17.4, 1.0. 11B NMR (128 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) −15.6. HR-ESI-MS m/z = 410.2764 (calcd for C27H33BN3 = 410.2768 [M − OMe]+). UV-Vis (in CH2Cl2) λ [nm] (ε [M−1 cm−1]) 325 (89715), 339 (162843), 437 (14007), 463 (29566). Fluorescence (in CH2Cl2, λex = 339 nm) λmax [nm] 469, 481, 496; ΦF = 0.12.
