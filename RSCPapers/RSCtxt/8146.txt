    , Accepted 31st August 2022First published on 1st September 2022AbstractThe potential use of halide perovskite materials in ferroelectric and piezoelectric devices has recently been unraveled, but for widespread applications, detailed and systematic experiments are essential. We report on a preferentially oriented low dimensional (2D) layered all-inorganic halide perovskite material – CsPb2Br5, demonstrating piezoelectric and ferroelectric behavior at room temperature. We have further fabricated a composite of preferentially orientated CsPb2Br5 microplates with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to study its energy harvesting behavior as a nanogenerator. The pristine tetragonal CsPb2Br5 microplates show a piezoelectric coefficient (d33) value of ≈72 pm V−1 and a remanent polarization of ≈0.06 μC cm−2 estimated from piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) and polarization hysteresis (PE) loop measurement, respectively. Four composite devices with varying weight percentages of perovskite in the PVDF matrix are investigated and compared with a pure PVDF-based nanogenerator to assess their energy harvesting performance. It is observed that the CsPb2Br5-PVDF hybrid films respond as excellent functional materials for piezoelectric-based mechanical energy harvesters. The incorporation of CsPb2Br5 into the PVDF matrix allows for high crystallinity and electroactive-phase nucleation of approximately 92% in the PVDF, which is greater than pristine PVDF. Under periodic vertical compression, the best device fabricated has an instantaneous output voltage of ≈200 V, a current of ≈2.8 μA, and a power of ≈45 μW across a 5 MΩ resistor. The output voltage is also produced by various human actions like leg pressing, finger bending, and arm bending using the best device. The output AC voltage of the best device is used to charge a capacitor of 2.2 μF capacitance up to ≈3.8 V DC, which is further used to light up some LEDs as a proof of concept. Our findings have the potential to pave the way for high-performance nanogenerators using a layered halide perovskite family of materials.
1. Introduction
Materials having potential uses in emerging global technologies, especially in energy, environment, health, and other important sectors, have received a lot of attention recently. The halide perovskites (ABX3, X = Cl, Br, I, and their combinations) are among several classes of materials undergoing unprecedented research due to their unique optoelectronic properties that have found enormous utility in next-generation solar cells, photodetectors, LEDs, sensors, memory devices, and lasers.1–11 Hybrid perovskites with excellent optical absorption, high carrier mobility, long diffusion length, variable bandgap, and high solution processability have resulted in photovoltaic advancements with exceptional power conversion efficiencies.12–16
Simultaneously, the discovery of intriguing electronic features has led to intense research in the area of energy storage devices like capacitors and batteries.17–20 The fascinating ferroelectric and piezoelectric attributes of these materials have an immediate translational effect in mechanical energy harvesting and storage, which is yet to be fully explored.21–26 A significant metric to be achieved in the pursuit of high-performance, environment-friendly energy harvesters is their power conversion efficiency. Owing to their promising abilities to generate electricity via impact stress, vibration, or flexing with relatively simple device design, low cost, and feasibility of large-scale fabrication, piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) are particularly intriguing and have application potential in this field. Wang et al. used the term piezoelectric nanogenerator in their landmark 2006 paper based on piezoelectricity in ZnO nanowires.27 Consequently, substantial studies have concentrated on the piezoelectric nanogenerator’s materials design, structural modeling, operating mechanism, and output performance optimization.
Halide perovskite nanogenerators have very recently been utilized in harvesting mechanical energy due to their exceptional ferroic characteristics. After poling by an electric field of 80 kV cm−1, Kim et al. developed a MAPbI3-based piezoelectric nanogenerator with a promising output voltage of 2.7 V and current density up to 140 nA cm−2.28 The ability to use perovskite-based piezoelectric nanogenerators as flexible devices is one of their most significant advantages. Stress causes a voltage to develop in the device, which then transfers an electron from the bottom to the top electrode via the external circuit, resulting in a positive current/voltage signal. The performance of a piezoelectric device depends mainly on the value of the piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of the material. Now d33 ∝ ∈Pr, where ∈ is the dielectric permittivity, and Pr is the remanent polarization. A substantial remanent polarisation is a parameter that contributes to improving the device’s performance. The coupled dynamics of the molecular ion, together with the inorganic octahedral cage, create non-centrosymmetry in the crystal, resulting in spontaneous polarisation in organic–inorganic halide perovskites. According to the crystal symmetry simulation, the inorganic halide perovskite CsPbBr3 has a polarization of 0.45 μC cm−2.29 The polarization in inorganic halide perovskite may arise from ionic off-centering in the BX6 octahedral cage rotation.30 MAPbI3 crystallizing in a tetragonal lattice system, and I4/mcm space group with a 4mm point group, shows ferroelectric behavior.31 Additionally, MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 show octahedral rotation alternatively around the c axis at room temperature, obeying the SrTiO3 type tetrahedral perovskite structure.32–34 The application of pressure and epitaxial strain is another cause that can induce polarization in a material. The presence of ferroelectricity in halide materials is suggested by the predicted nonlinear behavior of the polarization with the electrical field.29 Apart from the theoretical predictions, some recent experimental studies on the ferroelectricity as well as piezoelectricity of inorganic halide perovskite materials like CsPbBr3 have been reported.29,35 Very recently, a new tetragonal perovskite structure AM2X5 (A is a cation, M = Pb, Sn, X = Cl, Br, I) has been synthesized, which has a different crystal structure from the conventional AMX3 perovskite structures. Although CsPb2Br5 was initially identified as a by-product during the synthesis of CsPbBr3 and Cs4PbBr6 perovskite, it showed distinct 2D properties and a crystal structure that differed significantly from CsPbBr3. The CsPb2Br5 crystallized in a two-dimensional tetragonal structure, with one Cs ion layer sandwiched between two Pb–Br layers.36–40 Furthermore, unlike CsPbBr3, which has to be synthesized at a high temperature, CsPb2Br5 may be easily produced at ambient temperature, making it an attractive contender for future uses.
In this work, we report the fabrication of highly stable layered CsPb2Br5 microplates showing a d33 value of ≈72 pm V−1 and a Pr of ≈0.06 μC cm−2. We have prepared a nanocomposite of CsPb2Br5 microplates and PVDF with four different percentages. PVDF has five different polymorphs; α, β, γ, δ, and ∈ phase, because of its repeating chemical unit (–CH2–/–CF2–). The polar phase (β phase) of PVDF plays a significant role in energy harvesting applications and must be appropriately tailored in the composite. The sample containing 3 wt% CsPb2Br5 in the PVDF composite exhibits the largest β phase activation and, as a result, the most prominent piezoelectric features and remanent polarisation. The optimized device constructed had an output voltage of ≈200 V and a current of ≈2.8 μA under periodic vertical compressions. Furthermore, the energy harvested from the 3 wt% device was employed for capacitor charging. The optimum device’s robustness is demonstrated by a fatigue test for continuous 1000 cycles operation. These results demonstrate that low-dimensional inorganic perovskites and their optimum weight percentage composites with PVDF can be employed to create high-performance nanogenerator devices.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Cesium acetate (CsAc) and lead bromide (PbBr2) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Ethanol and hydrobromic acid were purchased from Alfa-Aesar. All of these chemicals were utilized without further purification.
2.2. CsPb2Br5 synthesis
Microplates of CsPb2Br5 were synthesized in ambient conditions. First, 6 mL ethanol and 2 mL DI water were combined to make a water–ethanol combination. Following that, 1 mmol CsAc and 2.5 mmol PbBr2 were added to the aforementioned mixture one by one over a 20 minute window. Additionally, the entire mixture was stirred for 2 hours, ensuring the production and precipitation of CsPb2Br5. The precipitate was treated with HBr and then centrifuged with DI water to eliminate impurities. The collected sample was dried overnight at 80 °C.
2.3. Thin film fabrication of PVDF and CsPb2Br5 composite
To make pristine PVDF film and a PVDF-CsPb2Br5 hybrid thin film, a single-step chemical method was adopted. A 20 mL solution of DMF and acetone at a 4:6 ratio was mixed with 1.5 g PVDF pellets to make bare PVDF film. This mixture was stirred for 2 hours at 80 °C. Once the solution was clear, it was dropped onto pre-cleaned glass slides. The coated glass slides were then stored overnight in a vacuum oven at 85 °C. Finally, the coated slides were removed from the oven, and the films were carefully separated from the glass slides. Except for the extra addition of CsPb2Br5 with varying wt% in the mixed solution of acetone, DMF, and PVDF, the rest of the experimental techniques remained the same for the fabrication of other composite films. Fig. S1 (please see ESI†) shows a schematic of the fabrication process for composite thin films. Additionally, the preparation of the film and the device, as well as the encapsulation of the device, are displayed using a few digital pictures taken throughout the procedure and shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.†
3. Characterization
The synthesized samples’ X-ray diffraction (XRD) was measured at room temperature using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) on a SmartLab Multipurpose X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corp., Japan). The Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy were done using a Supra 35 VP for microstructural and elemental analysis, respectively. A JEOL 2100F transmission electron microscope was used to perform high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the oxidation states of the constituent elements in the synthesized sample. The powder CsPb2Br5 samples were pressed into a pellet with a diameter of 10 mm, and a thickness of 1.08 mm using stainless steel dies for dielectric measurements. Silver (Ag) paste was applied to both sides of the pellet, which was then placed in a stainless steel two-electrode configuration to make robust electrical connections. Dielectric measurements in the frequency range of 20 Hz–1 MHz were made using an LCR spectrometer (HIOKI, model: IM 3536). To further assess the phase parameters of the CsPb2Br5 and PVDF nanocomposites, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) (FTIR-Spectrum 2, PerkinElmer) was used. The thermal stability and phase change of the synthesized samples were assessed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, PerkinElmer) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, PerkinElmer), respectively. The piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) was performed in an Asylum Research AFM (MFP-3D BIO) by applying a voltage to investigate the local piezoresponse properties within the CsPb2Br5 and the composite films. The RADIANT ferroelectric test apparatus (Radiant Technologies Inc.) and Vision software were used to perform the room temperature ferroelectric measurement. A digital oscilloscope (YOKOGAWA, DL 1640) was used to investigate the piezoelectric characteristics of PVDF and the composite films during manual human finger tapping.
4. Results and discussion
Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) data was performed to obtain the structural details using FullProf, and the representative crystal structure was rendered using VESTA. This structural refinement proves that CsPb2Br5 belongs to the tetragonal I4/mcm space group and the lattice parameters are a = b = 8.462 Å, c = 15.160 Å. The refined lattice parameters confirm that the as prepared CsPb2Br5 has a lattice compression with respect to bulk CsPb2Br5 single crystal.41 The refined XRD data and the 2D layered crystal structure are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively. A strong preferential orientation along the [002], [004], [006], and [008] planes is indicated in the XRD profile.

Fig. S3 in the ESI† shows the XRD profile of the same sample at different time intervals over a span of six months of synthesis, indicating that the CsPb2Br5 perovskite is quite stable under ambient conditions. A Cs layer in the crystal structure separates every two adjacent Pb2Br5 layers along the c-axis in CsPb2Br5. Unlike the traditional 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, where the interlayer force is weak, the interlayer force in CsPb2Br5 is substantial due to the bonding of Cs and Br. In this CsPb2Br5 structure, to make a CsBr10 bicapped square prism, each Cs atom is bonded with 10 Br atoms, whereas to build a PbBr8 bicapped trigonal prism, each Pb atom is bonded to 8 Br atoms. The CsPb2Br5 has completely different coordination structures as compared to CsPbBr3 (ABO3 type perovskites), where every Cs atom is connected to 8 Br atoms, and each Pb atom is bonded to 6 Br atoms. Fig. 1(c) shows a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image and clearly reveals the crystallinity of the CsPb2Br5 sample. The inter-planar spacing was found to be 0.38 nm and corresponds to the [004] plane. Fig. 1(d) shows the FESEM image of pristine CsPb2Br5, which has a microplate-like morphological structure with a size of 40–80 μm and a thickness of 1–1.5 μm. The elemental analysis of the synthesized sample presented in Fig. 1(e) using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirms that only Cs, Pb, and Br are present in the sample with a 1:2:5 ratio. This result is consistent with the XRD data and supports the formation of a pure phase. Elemental mapping of these elements over the scanned region (shown in Fig. S4: please see ESI†) indicates that all the constituent elements are uniformly distributed. Fig. 1(f) shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the synthesized sample over a wide temperature range of 25–600 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis indicates that no decomposition occurs until 340 °C. A total weight loss of 3% is found between the temperature range 360–400 °C, corresponding to the decomposition of PbBr2 (boiling point of PbBr2 is 370 °C). Further increments in the temperature register a sharp fall in weight loss at 425 °C, which can be attributed to the evaporation of the sample. Even though the degradation might have started at 360 °C, the actual melting temperature is 430 °C, as the DSC curve also shows a sharp peak at 430 °C. At temperatures of 352 °C, 430 °C, and 215 °C, the DSC curve shows two sharp and one broad anomaly. The anomaly at 352 °C results from the starting point of the melting temperature of the sample. Because the corresponding TGA curve shows no mass loss, the large anomaly in the DSC curve at 215 °C implies a probable phase change.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the chemical composition and oxidation state of CsPb2Br5. Fig. 2(a)–(d) shows the survey scan of CsPb2Br5 and the high-resolution XPS spectra of the constituent elements, i.e., Cs 3d, Pb 4f, and Br 3d core levels, respectively. The Cs 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 core level peaks appeared at 723.8 and 737.8 eV, respectively (Fig. 2(b)). Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 levels are represented by the peaks at 138.4 eV and 143.2 eV, respectively (Fig. 2(c)). The Br 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 levels relate to the deconvolution of the peak with a shoulder into two distinct peaks at 68.1 eV and 69.1 eV, respectively (Fig. 2(d)). The positions of the peaks related to Cs, Pb, and Br confirm that they are in the Cs1+, Pb2+, and Br1− states, respectively.42

Fig. 3(a) shows the frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity for a temperature range of 313–473 K. The value of the dielectric permittivity decreases with the increase in frequency, and this can be attributed to the fact that the dipole moments are no longer capable of following the electric field in the high-frequency region.36Fig. 3(b) shows that the temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity increases with the rise in temperature at a constant frequency. The electric dipole moment and the presence of thermally activated charge carriers are accountable for enhancing the dielectric permittivity with increasing temperature.43,44

The frequency-dependent dielectric loss factor (tanδ) decreases with increasing frequency (as shown in Fig. 3(c)) at temperatures ranging from 313 to 473 K. This is primarily because only the electronic and ionic polarization dominate the high-frequency region.45,46 On the other hand, the existence of orientational and interfacial polarization in addition to ionic and electronic polarization increases the dielectric loss factor in the low-frequency domain. Fig. 3(d) shows that the loss factor at a constant frequency increases with temperature, confirming that dipolar polarization is a thermally dominated mechanism and that electrical conductivity rises with temperature when activated by thermally generated charge carriers.
We used piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) to evaluate the piezoelectric behavior of CsPb2Br5. The ability of piezoelectric devices to convert mechanical deformation into electricity, characterized by the magnitude of the piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of the material, plays a critical role in their performance. The PFM amplitude and phase images reveal the presence of electrically active polarizable domains in the CsPb2Br5 microplates. Fig. 4 shows the obtained images of (a) topography, (b) amplitude (A), and (c) phase (φ) of the CsPb2Br5 samples with an active area of 20 μm × 20 μm. Additionally, for the CsPb2Br5 microplates, the butterfly-shaped amplitude loop and phase angle derived hysteresis loops are shown in Fig. 4(d) and (e), respectively. The amplitude loop and phase hysteresis loop were performed at a bias voltage of ±10 V. The amplitude of the butterfly loop is 942 pm. For statistical relevance, the amplitude and phase loop of CsPb2Br5 microplates were also performed at different regions in the sample and are shown in Fig. S5 (please see ESI†). The piezoelectric coefficient is known to be given by Adeflection = d33Eac.47 The absolute value of d33 of the CsPb2Br5 microplates is ≈72 pm V−1 and comparable to the d33 value of other halide perovskites. The phase hysteresis loop in Fig. 4(e) shows 180° switching of the domain. The piezoresponse hysteresis loop was calculated using the equation Pr(E) = A(E)cos[φ(E)].48 The resulting piezoresponse hysteresis loop of CsPb2Br5 is asymmetric and shown in Fig. S6 (please see ESI†). A shift towards negative bias along the electric field axis is observed, implying that the CsPb2B5 microplate already has a built-in field that promotes polarization in a specific direction. A Sawyer–Tower circuit was used to investigate the macroscopic polarization of the CsPb2Br5 microplates and shows a remanent polarization of ∼0.06 μC cm−2 in Fig. 4(f).

The piezoelectric response and polarization observed in CsPb2Br5 microplates may originate from the micro strain. These microplates are strongly oriented in a particular direction along [002], its second, third, and fourth-order planes. Due to lattice compression, the micro strain calculated in CsPb2Br5 microplates is 0.21%, whereas the micro strain in CsPb2Br5 nanoform synthesized in our prior study36 was only 0.032%. For P–E loop comparison, the CsPb2Br5 nanoplate was synthesized using the previously reported method.36 The P–E loop of CsPb2Br5 nanoplates gives a lossy loop with a tiny amount of polarization (Fig. S7: please see ESI†). Thus, it is plausible that the presence of the micro strain within the material caused this piezoelectric response and an acceptable amount of polarization in the CsPb2Br5 microplates. Such strain-induced ferroelectric polarization in a centrosymmetric material like the SrTiO3 membrane has previously been documented.49
It was recently discovered that halide perovskites have the ability to activate the polar phase in PVDF.50 To explore the creation of perovskite-induced electroactive phase constitution in composites, FTIR spectroscopy of the PVDF and all the synthesized composites was performed, and the result is shown in Fig. 5(a). The composite samples are labeled PPF1, PPF2, PPF3, and PPF4 based on the amount of CsPb2Br5 in the PVDF matrix, with PPF1 having 1 wt% CsPb2Br5 in the PVDF matrix and so on. As seen by the spectra in Fig. 5(a), adding perovskite had a significant impact on the presence of the α, β, and γ phases in PVDF. The FTIR spectra within the range of 1600–400 cm−1 reveal absorption bands at 613, 764, 796, and 976 cm−1, corresponding to the α-phase of PVDF (TGTG configuration).45 The electroactive β-phase appears at 840 and 1279 cm−1, whereas the γ-phase appears at 812 cm−1. From the figure, it is evident that pristine PVDF crystallized primarily in the non-electroactive α-phase. The addition of perovskite to the PVDF matrix resulted in a significant reduction in the peak intensity of the α-phase while simultaneously increasing the peak intensity of the β-phase. Subsequently, the α-peaks were suppressed monotonically when the perovskite concentration was increased to 3 wt%. Fig. 5(b) shows the variation in β-phase percentage as a function of perovskite loading. For quantitative analysis of the electroactive phase content in the perovskite PVDF composite matrix, the following formula is used:  where FEA is the electroactive phase percentage. A764 and A840 are the intensities of the absorption peak at 764 cm−1 (non-electroactive) and 840 cm−1 (electroactive), respectively. K764 and K840 are the absorption coefficients corresponding to the peaks at 764 cm−1 and 840 cm−1, with values of 6.1 × 104 cm2 mol−1 and 7.7 × 104 cm2 mol−1, respectively. The phase percentage reached >92% with 3 wt% CsPb2Br5 loading, more than twice as much as the pristine PVDF (42%) phase percentage. Further increment in the CsPb2Br5 loading up to 4 wt% percent resulted in the re-emergence of some of the α-phase, possibly due to perovskite aggregation in the PVDF matrix at higher loading.50 The surface charge of CsPb2Br5 interacts with the PVDF –CH2– and –CF2– dipoles interfacially. This interaction promotes the preferred ordering of the PVDF chains from α (TGTG) configuration to β (TTTT) configuration, leading to an increase in electroactive phase percentage in the PVDF matrix.51 The effective mass of the –CH2– dipole increases due to the interfacial interaction, which promotes a decrease in vibrational frequency. So, such interaction behaves like a source of damping.52 The angular frequency of the –CH2 stretching vibration dipole, under damped and undamped conditions, is linked to the damping constant. The amount of perovskite in the film increases the measured values of damping constants. It is worth noting that the electroactive β-phase formation and damping constant behave similarly under perovskite loading suggesting a direct link between phase development in the PVDF matrix as a result of dipolar interaction with CsPb2Br5.53

Fig. 5(c) shows the FESEM micrograph of the PPF3 sample. It demonstrates the presence of orientated fibrils and the composite’s spherulitic shape. FESEM images of all the other composites and the pristine PVDF are shown in Fig. S8 for comparison (please see ESI†). Fig. 5(d) shows the EDX mapping of the PPF3 composite, which indicates the elemental presence of Cs, Pb, Br, C, and F in correct stoichiometry. Further, the EDX scan profile of the PPF3 sample in Fig. S9 (please see ESI†) shows the presence of C, F, Cs, Pb, and Br, which indicates the successful fabrication of the CsPb2Br5-PVDF hybrid. The X-ray diffraction patterns of pure PVDF, PPF1, PPF2, PPF3, and PPF4 composite films are presented in Fig. S10 (please see ESI†). Pure PVDF shows characteristic peaks at 18.7° and 20.2° corresponding to α (020) and γ (200) phases, respectively, which confirms the dominating nature of the α-phase in pristine PVDF. The β (200) peak arises at 20.7° in PPF1 after adding CsPb2Br5 perovskite to PVDF.54 As the amount of perovskite in PPF2 increases, the intensity of β (200) increases while the intensity of α (020) decreases. In PPF3, α (020) has almost vanished, the corresponding γ (020) peak has appeared, and the β (200) peak has increased in intensity. With further increase of perovskite in the PVDF matrix (PPF4), α (020) and α (110) peaks re-emerged, peaks of γ (200) and γ (020) have entirely disappeared, while the intensity of β (200) reduced. It may be possible that perovskite agglomeration induced by an additional increase in perovskite % causes the α-phase to re-emerge. In the composites, the primary characteristic peak for pure PVDF at 19.9° is displaced to a higher diffraction angle, confirming the activation of the polar phase.55

Fig. 6 represents the schematic rendering of the possible interaction between the positive surface charge of CsPb2Br5 and the CH2–CF2 dipoles of PVDF. The percentage of the electroactive phase in the composite increases due to this interaction. PPF1 and PPF2 have weaker interactions and a lower fraction of β-phase due to low perovskite content. When the perovskite filler is loaded at 3 wt%, it disperses uniformly throughout the polymer matrix, and more interactions occur. However, when the filler is loaded at more than 3 wt%, agglomeration of perovskite occurs in PPF4, leading to the re-emergence of the α-phase and some reduction in the β-phase.50

The XPS analysis of the PPF3 sample is presented in Fig. 7. Fig. 7(a) shows the surface scan of the PPF3 film showing peaks related to Cs, Pb, Br, C, and F in the spectra. The C 1s spectrum is deconvoluted into three peaks at 284.5, 285.8, and 290.4 eV in Fig. 7(b). The CH2 bond is responsible for the first two peaks, while the CF2 bond is responsible for the third. The F 1s peak also deconvolutes into two peaks, one at 684.5 eV and the other at 687.2 eV, as shown in Fig. 7(c). The first peak emanates from the C–F semi-ionic bond, and the second one from the C–F covalent bond.56 These are observed to be slightly displaced from the peaks observed for the pristine PVDF and can be attributed to the internal electric field created due to the hybrid formation.50 The core-level XPS spectra of Cs and Pb in Fig. 7(d) and (e) show the usual doublet features. Cs 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks are identified at 738.4 and 724.4 eV, respectively.50 Peaks for Pb are seen at 143.7 and 138.8 eV, related to the 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 states, respectively.57 Br 3d5/2 and Br 3d3/2 deconvoluted peaks emerged at 68.4 and 69.5 eV, respectively, as seen in Fig. 7(f). The arrangement of peaks also suggests the 1+, 2+, and 1− oxidation states for Cs, Pb, and Br, respectively.58

The dielectric behavior of the PPF3 composite is shown in Fig. S11 (please see ESI†). Frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity and loss factor (tanδ) have been plotted for a frequency range of 100 Hz to 1 MHz at room temperature. The value of the dielectric permittivity decreases with increasing the frequency of the composite system. All types of polarization cause a considerable increase in ∈r values for a fixed applied voltage at low frequencies. At high frequencies, the values of dielectric constants are usually lower due to the weakening of interfacial/space polarization.
Fig. S12(a) (please see ESI†) shows the P–E (polarization vs. electric field) loop of all the composite films and pure PVDF. The remanent polarization value for PVDF at a 2 kV cm−1 applied electric field is 4.5 × 10−5 μC cm−2. This value increases significantly to 3.9 × 10−4 μC cm−2 in the case of the PPF3 composite (see enlarged view in Fig. S12(b) in ESI†). The maximum polarization for PVDF and PPF3 were 0.001 and 0.004 μC cm−2, respectively, under a 2 kV cm−1 applied electric field. Of all the composite samples and PVDF, the saturation polarization, remanent polarization, and coercive field of the PPF3 sample are maximum. The increase in the remanent and saturation polarization in PPF3 suggests that the PVDF chain (CH2–CF2) present in the hybrid has a larger dipole moment per unit volume. Conversely, PVDF has a lower remanent polarization than the hybrid due to less dipole–dipole interaction. Pristine PVDF mainly comprises non-polar α-phases, whereas the composite is mostly made up of polar β-phase with a higher dipole moment. The addition of perovskite to the PVDF matrix facilitates favorable dipole alignment in the hybrid system, resulting in a larger remnant polarization. With such high remanent polarization in the system, a higher piezo output is not unexpected. Consequently, the value of polarization increases with the weight percentage of the halide perovskite until it attains a 3 wt% ratio. Beyond this point, say 4 wt%, the polarisation decreases due to a reduction in the electroactive β phase.
Further, we demonstrate the application of flexible piezoelectric nanogenerators with varying CsPb2Br5 compositions in PVDF because of its prominent ferroelectric behavior in both pristine CsPb2Br5 and composite CsPb2Br5: PVDF form. Multiple nanogenerator films with dimensions of 5 × 2 cm2 were fabricated from the CsPb2Br5: PVDF composites to estimate the piezo output voltages. The reference nanogenerator is fabricated using pristine PVDF and referred to as RNG. The other composite nanogenerators are labeled NG1, NG2, NG3, and NG4, where the affix numeric with NG represents the wt% of the perovskite loaded in the PVDF. The piezoelectric output of all devices is tested without any additional electrical poling. Fig. 8(a) and (b) depict the instantaneous output voltage and current of all devices after hammering by hand with a constant amplitude of ≈80 MPa. The same figures also show that the maximum instantaneous output voltage and current of NG3 are ≈200 V and ≈2.8 μA. The output voltage and current registered from the RNG under the same experimental setting are only ≈26 V and ≈0.70 μA, respectively. The measured output power for NG3 is ≈45 μW, as shown in Fig. 8(c). The output performance of the NG3 device was investigated for externally connected load resistances (Fig. 8(d)) and demonstrates that when the load resistance increases, output voltage increases, and the output current declines. The observed non-linearity however could be due to ohmic losses.59 We also investigated the performance of NG3 in a range of additional human activities, including arm bending, finger bending, and leg pressing. On a regular basis, we use power to charge numerous rechargeable electronic devices. Nanogenerator energy is an excellent solution to replacing the energy source for gadgets. We attached NG3 to one arm and contracted and expanded it continuously. A maximum output of ≈2.8 V was measured during arm contraction and expansion (Fig. 8(e)). When the pressure was released, the output voltage flipped direction due to arm expansion. This result suggests that NG3 could be employed as a source of energy in various human activities such as foot striking, jogging, and so on. The ability of NG3 to detect bending forces was tested in addition to pressing forces. A voltage vs. time graph for a small bending of NG3 by finger, which resulted in an output voltage of ≈6.7 V, is shown in Fig. 8(f). A sharp peak was formed after bending. The voltage peaks changed in the other direction once the bending was eliminated. In addition to finger and arm bending, the performance of NG3 was examined under leg toe impression. In this experiment, the leg toe was repeatedly pushed, and the results are displayed in Fig. 8(g). A quick shift in voltage up to ≈8 V generated by the pressure of the leg toe established NG3’s superior sensitivity. The voltage flipped when the toe pressure was released. Such uniform swings on both sides of the voltage axis suggest that NG3 may be incorporated into a shoe that can recharge portable and wearable devices while walking or jogging.

(e) Voltage response due to arm bending, (f) bending by finger, (g) leg pressing, and (h) instantaneous output voltage in forward and reverse bias. (i) Output voltage response of NG3 due to drum beats of a toy (shown in inset). 
A switching polarity test of NG3 was also performed to determine whether or not the registered output was a piezoresponse. On reversing the polarity, the amount of output generated was almost the same (Fig. 8(h)). Further, we have fabricated NG3 devices multiple times and their piezoresponse is monitored on different occasions. The registered performance from two such devices, with the oscilloscope readings in the insets, is presented in Fig. S13 (please see the ESI†). No observable differences in output characteristics were found. Similar output behavior for multiple devices at different times motivates us to think that the output response is dominantly caused by piezoelectric effects rather than triboelectric effects. We acknowledge that there is always some amount of tribo-effect interspersed in the signal that is generated via contact at the time of applying pressure or friction which we are unable to distinguish due to the lack of specific instruments operating in different geometries that can separate out the tribo signal from the piezo signal.60 A video (please refer to video supplementary VS1†) demonstrating that the voltage signal is generated when the device is being pressed, not when it is being rubbed is shared as proof of the dominant piezoresponse. Further, the PNG’s suitability for extensive deployment in real-world applications was investigated. We attached it to a toy drum (Fig. 8(i)) and monitored the output voltage in response to the continuous drum beats. NG3 provides a high output voltage of ≈5 V under the mild drum beats, making it suitable for usage in real-world applications.
We found that when pristine PVDF sheets are substantially compressed, the piezoelectric voltage produced is very low. The voltage and current outputs are significantly improved when CsPb2Br5 is added to PVDF with various loading fractions, as illustrated in Fig. 8. An added advantage is that the composite films are self-poled and do not require additional poling treatment. CsPb2Br5 is used as a filler in this PVDF to improve the electroactive phase content. This implementation, and hence phase conversion (self-poling), is straightforward, quick, and inexpensive. The β-phase exhibits the largest dipole moment per unit cell compared to the α- and γ-phases, and the phase composition of the β-phase in the sample rises with the addition of the CsPb2Br5 filler, as demonstrated by FTIR and XRD investigations.

Fig. 9(a) shows the schematic of the working principle of the nanogenerator. The initial state and charge separation under compression is shown. On the application of pressure on the NG devices, they deformed. The devices accumulated the most charges in the shortest period of time when deformed to their utmost. Dipoles become misaligned when pressure is removed, and the accumulated charge flows in the other direction. Several devices require fast charging–discharging with high output voltage in a short amount of time, in addition to high instantaneous output. NG3 was coupled to a capacitor through a bridge rectifier and subjected to biomechanical action in this context. The capacitor charging circuit is shown in the inset of Fig. 9(b). Fig. 9(b) depicts capacitor charging as a function of time for three distinct capacitors: 2.2, 4.7, and 10 μF. This result also shows that just by hand hammering for a brief time interval of 13 seconds, the 2.2 μF capacitor could be fully charged (≈3.8 V). The following equation was used to compute the power stored in the capacitor:  where Pout is power stored, and C stands for the capacitance of the capacitor. The saturation voltage is V, and the time it takes to reach that value is t. The capacitor’s stored power is estimated to be ≈1.22 μW, which is sufficient to run small electrical devices. To assess how long the nanogenerator could last in long-term applications, we ran it through a fatigue test at a frequency of ≈3 Hz for 1000 cycles. On a regular basis, we used a ‘beat the drum’ toy to supply mechanical force to the nanogenerator. The output voltage across the nanogenerator during the 1000 cycles is shown in Fig. 9(c). Despite the long cycle operation, no significant attenuation in output voltage is seen. These findings show that nanogenerators’ piezoresponse is not affected by moisture, seasonal temperature changes, or other factors. After 1000 cycles of operation, FESEM was used to examine the microstructure of the hybrid film embedded in the device (Fig. S14: please see ESI†). Even after such long repeated processes, a detailed examination of the hybrid film using the FESEM reveals no serious flaws, fractures, or breaks. All of these data corroborate the nanogenerator’s long-term dependability and durability, as well as its efficacy as an energy harvester under extreme conditions. Video proof of device stability for 100 times of hand hammering is shown, along with real-time electrometer readings in the video supplementary VS2.†

The nanogenerator was then tested by lighting green LEDs. The nanogenerator device was equipped with a bridge rectifier, which converted the alternating current into direct current. Fig. 9(c) (inset) and video clip VS3 (please see ESI video†) shows the nanogenerator lighting up an array of commercially available green LEDs without the use of any external power source. The figure of merit of the constructed nanogenerator is also included in the comparative table of various published piezoelectric nanogenerators in Table S1 of the ESI.†
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, we present a piezoelectric 2D all-inorganic halide perovskite suitable for energy harvesting nanogenerators. We synthesized a nanocomposite using preferentially oriented CsPb2Br5 microplates and PVDF to examine its energy harvesting behavior as a nanogenerator. In addition to the composite, bare tetragonal CsPb2Br5 microplates show piezoelectric and ferroelectric features. Bare CsPb2Br5 has a d33 value of ≈72 pm V−1 and a remanent polarisation value of 0.06 μC cm−2, according to piezoelectric force microscopy and P–E loop measurement. Five composite devices with varying CsPb2Br5 loadings in PVDF, as well as a device made entirely of PVDF, were fabricated for performance comparison. The composite with the 3 wt% CsPb2Br5 had the highest polarization of all the composites. When exposed to periodic vertical compression, the optimized device produces an output voltage of ∼200 V and we got a maximum power of ∼45 μW. A long 1000 cycles operation was performed to evaluate the mechanical stability and durability, demonstrating its suitability for long-term usage. This simple and cost-effective solution, which combines soft polymer with all inorganic layered halide perovskite in a single unit, will provide a promising platform for the fabrication of flexible, highly durable energy harvesters and self-powered wearable sensor systems that can be used in any location with a variety of mechanical movements.
