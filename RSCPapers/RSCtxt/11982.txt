    , Accepted 3rd July 2017First published on 5th July 2017AbstractWe performed systematic experiments based on a small molecule donor and a polymer acceptor containing a naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based polymer as compared with fullerene-based acceptor (PC71BM) solar cells. Among polymer acceptors, the NDI-based polymer (PNDI-2T) shows good properties such as broad light absorbance with a strong absorption co-efficient and a well oriented crystalline structure leading to high electron mobility. We monitored the photovoltaic properties of both PNDI-2T and PC71BM acceptors with a BDT2TR donor. Although the BDT2TR:PC71BM device showed a higher PCE of 8.20%, the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device also showed remarkable photovoltaic results with a PCE of 4.43%, VOC of 0.86 V, JSC of 7.26 mA cm−2, and FF of 71% indicating one of the highest efficiencies for small molecule donor and non-fullerene polymer acceptor systems. In particular, the PNDI-2T acceptor showed excellent thermal stability and intrinsic mechanical performance as compared with the PC71BM acceptor. To demonstrate the potential of the polymer acceptor for solar devices, we fabricated a device for testing thermal stability, high thickness tolerance, and the flexibility of the solar cell with bending stress. As a result, the PNDI-2T-based solar cell exhibited excellent thermal stability at 150 °C for 15 h and the PCE of the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device with a thick active layer (around 610 nm) maintained 80% of its initial value. Moreover, the flexible device with the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T system retained its homogeneous morphology and showed maintained photovoltaic performance even after 100 bending cycles. Therefore, PNDI-2T based organic solar cells have good potential for application as flexible and portable real energy generators.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered as one of the most important candidates for potable power generators, because of their unique advantages such as low cost, light weight, amenability to large-area processing techniques, and flexibility.1–8 Traditional OSCs utilize fullerene derivatives, generally [6,6]-phenyl C61 (or C71) butyric acid methyl ester as the electron-acceptor due to its high electron mobility and formation of a balanced morphology with donor materials, which have led to a dramatic improvement yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 11%.9 PCBM, however, suffers from some drawbacks such as expensive synthesis costs, limited optical properties, low thermal stability, and poor prospects for being used in flexible applications.10–13 To overcome these limitations, various small-molecule and polymeric non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been developed. As a result of this effort, blended active layers with a polymer donor and a small-molecule acceptor have yielded PCE values of over 11.2%.14 Other NFA-based donor–acceptor combinations are also attracting attention but have so far yielded lower PCE values: only as high as 7.7%,15 9.08%,16 and 4.8% (ref. 17) for polymer donor–polymer acceptor, small-molecule donor–acceptor, and small-molecule donor–polymer acceptor blends, respectively.
Among these combinations, we are particularly interested in mixing a small molecule donor with a polymer acceptor. In the blend system of the small-molecule donor and polymer acceptor as the photo-active layer, the small-molecule donor may be expected to easily penetrate into the polymer acceptor chain region and induce a favorable well-mixed morphology and optimal bulk heterojunction (BHJ) system. In contrast to our expectations, however, relatively low PCE values have been recorded for small-molecule donor–polymer acceptor OSCs, due to insufficient charge carrier separation and transport.19,20 For example, a PCE of 3.74% was reported for a thieno[2,3-f]benzofuran (TBF)-based small molecule with diketopyrrolopyrrole-thieno[2,3-f]benzofuran (DTT) blended with an imide-functionalized N2200 polymer acceptor.22 And Jung et al. recently reported a PCE value of 4.82%17 for a small molecule composed of dithienopyran (DTP) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (TPD) combined with the P(NDT2OD-T2) polymer acceptor. Although the efficiency values of small-molecule donor–polymer acceptor OSCs have lagged behind those of other NFA OSCs, there are still opportunities to improve their device efficiency and stability levels. Generally, small-molecule donors have been shown to be monodisperse and have well-defined structures, and they display superior reproducibility.18 When compared with fullerene acceptor systems, polymer NFAs display various features i.e., fine tuning of the energy level efficiently by having their structures chemically tailored and broad absorption with a high absorption coefficient and a well-oriented crystalline structure. In addition, the polymer acceptor has been shown to have a high Tg (>200 °C), greater than that of the fullerene acceptor (Tg > 130 °C),25 and such a high Tg increases its potential for use in real devices,26 resulting in more rigid donor:acceptor blend systems, obstructing acceptor diffusion and aggregation and hence affording OPV devices with longer lifetimes.37,38 Furthermore, polymeric NFAs have a relatively high potential for applications in commercial devices, because these polymer acceptors have a much higher intrinsic flexibility than PC71BM and also make for a strengthened material with enhanced stability due to entanglements between the polymer chains.21 Although the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) values for almost all of these small-molecule donor–polymer acceptor devices have been found to be low, the steady improvement of the PCEs in this class does bode well for ultimately realizing high performance. Among the various polymer NFAs, naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based polymers have been widely used, and have shown intriguing properties, in particular high electron affinity, electron mobility, and strong π–π intermolecular interactions.23–25 NDI has been shown to be beneficial for not only charge transport but also favorable photochemical properties, and has been the most successfully used building block for NFA-OSCs.
In this current study, the efficiency and stability of OSCs based on the efficient small-molecule donor BDT2TR and the polymer acceptor poly([N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)) (PNDI-2T) were investigated systematically and compared to those of OSCs with PC71BM. BDT2TR is a promising donor material for OSCs because it has been shown to be able to participate in strong intermolecular interactions and has already been reported to exhibit a PCE of 8.56% with PC71BM.30 But here, the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device exhibited a PCE of 4.43%. We attribute this PCE value to the high FF of 71% due to the high crystallinity and favorable nano-fibril morphology resulting from the small-molecule donor and the polymer acceptor. Furthermore, we also studied the operational stability of the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device by investigating its thermal and mechanical properties. This device showed thermal stability, thickness tolerance, and flexibility levels that were all excellent, and considerably better than those observed for the PC71BM device. As mentioned above for polymeric NFAs, it is regarded as a remarkable test case for our hypothesis of combined reasonable efficiency and improved stability by a polymer NFA and a small molecule donor.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of the electron donor (BDT2TR) and two different acceptors (PC71BM and PNDI-2T) used and the individual absorption spectra of the donor and each of the acceptors in a spin-coated film are shown in Fig. 1b. The neat PNDI-2T film showed absorption maxima at 360 nm and 705 nm, with the absorption onset at 800 nm. In contrast, PC71BM was found to absorb light only in the 300–500 nm wavelength range, and thus provides a more limited contribution to solar cell performance than NFAs. Fig. 1c depicts the energy band diagram of the device. Clearly, both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the PC71BM and PNDI-2T acceptors were determined to be lower than those of the BDT2TR donor, and this difference could be expected to afford a sufficient driving force for exciton dissociation. A significant difference in the absorption coefficient spectra was observed (Fig. 1d). The BDT2TR:PNDI-2T film yielded well-matched complementary light absorption spectra in which significant absorption spanned the broad wavelength range from 300 nm to 800 nm and showed a significantly enhanced vibronic absorption peak of the (BDT2TR) donor. The thermal properties of the compounds were determined via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. S1†). The glass transition temperatures (Tg) were determined to be 160 and 225 °C for PC71BM and PNDI-2T, respectively and no melting transitions could be observed in the PNDI-2T, suggesting a highly crystalline polymer nature.

2.2 Photovoltaic properties & carrier characteristics
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device and to compare them with those of the PC71BM device, the OSCs were fabricated with a conventional device architecture, i.e., indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/BDT2TR:acceptor/Ca/Al. The blend ratio and conditions used for the PC71BM-containing device were taken from those previously optimized conditions.30 The photo-active layer of the device consisting of BDT2TR and PNDI-2T dissolved in chloroform with a thickness of ∼100 nm was optimized by testing 1.0:0.5, 1.0:0.8, 1.0:1.0, and 1.0:1.5 donor:acceptor ratios; the 1.0:1.0 blend ratio was found to be optimum (see Table S2 and Fig. S5†). Table 1 and Fig. 2a and b show the corresponding photovoltaic results. The PCE of the best BDT2TR:PC71BM device was 8.20% (VOC = 0.90 V, JSC = 12.62 mA cm−2, and FF = 72%). In contrast, for the PNDI-2T-based devices, a PCE of 4.43% with a VOC of 0.86 V, a JSC of 7.26 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71% was obtained. Even though the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device displayed low PCE with half values of JSC compared with the BDT2TR:PC71BM device, the FF of PNDI-2T based solar cell device is highly remarkable result due to its favorable morphology and nano-structural control. The distinct difference between the two devices is in their JSC values. As shown in Fig. 2b, the EQE value of the optimum PC71BM device was nearly 80% at a wavelength of 550 nm. The PNDI-2T device only yielded an EQE value as high as 40% despite the response up to 800 nm, consistent with the lower JSC of this device. These results might be attributed to the low hole and electron mobility. To investigate this reason, the photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiency of neat BDT2TR and blend films at an excitation wavelength of 600 nm was studied. As shown in the PL spectra of Fig. 2c, the quenching of the PL intensities of both the PC71BM and PNDI-2T systems was significant, and estimated to be 90% and 91%, respectively. These results suggested that excitons generated from BDT2TR were extracted and transported effectively to the donor–acceptor interface (channel I).39

In addition, the PL spectra of neat PNDI-2T and blend films were examined as shown in Fig. S2.† Upon blending BDT2TR with PNDI-2T, an effective PL quenching was also observed, which indicates photocurrent generation though PNDI-2T excitation followed by hole transfer from the polymer acceptor to the donor material (channel II).40 This suggests efficient charge transfer between the BDT2TR and PNDI-2T driven by both BDT2TR and PNDI-2T excitons. But the exciton dissociation does not play a role in explaining their different JSC values. The lower JSC in the PNDI-2T device than in the PC71BM device may have been predominantly caused by its low charge mobility: as shown in Table 1, the BDT2TR:PC71BM device showed hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) values of 3.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.70 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively – both higher than the corresponding 8.75 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.70 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 values for the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device. Even if the PNDI-2T exhibits good HOMO and LUMO energy level matching with small molecule donor, BDT2TR, for sufficient extraction and transportation of generated charge carrier, the limitation of JSC might happen by low hole and electron mobilities. Despite the relatively low JSC of the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device, its FF was remarkably high, 71%, and just about the same as the 72% value for the PC71BM device. This high FF may have been due to the highly crystalline nature and balanced charge carrier mobility of the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T system.
2.3 GIWASX-molecular ordering
To determine the orientation and molecular packing of PNDI-2T in the photo-active layer, a grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analysis was carried out under the optimized device conditions (Fig. 2d, e, S3, S4 and Table S1†). As shown in Fig. S3a,† the pure BDT2TR yielded a pronounced scattering peak for the (100) reflection, i.e., in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and a weak scattering peak in the in-plane (IP) direction, corresponding to a lamellar spacing of 22.21 Å and 20.41 Å, respectively. Its (010) peak along the IP direction was strong, and indicated a π–π stacking distance of 3.55 Å. According to these results, the BDT2TR donor exhibited a predominantly edge-on-oriented structure. The pristine PNDI-2T film showed a (100) peak in the IP direction with a lamellar spacing of 24.37 Å and a remarkable OOP (010) scattering with a distance of 4.03 Å, indicating a typical face-on orientation. The neat PC71BM film yielded a diffuse ring pattern, indicative of a disordered structure. Moreover, the BDT2TR:PC71BM film yielded a diffraction pattern nearly identical to that of the neat BDT2TR film, that is with OOP and IP lamellar spacings of 22.96 Å and 20.65 Å, respectively, and a (010) peak in the IP direction with a d spacing of 3.58 Å. This result indicated that the PC71BM did not disturb the BDT2TR crystallinity. For the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T blend film, an obvious face-on orientation profile with strong π–π stacking was indicated according to the OOP peak derived from PNDI-2T. Compared with the pure BDT2TR and PNDI-2T films, the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T film showed a strong (100) scattering peak, corresponding to a distance of 23.60 Å (BDT2TR) in the OOP direction and 21.30 Å (BDT2TR) and 24.73 Å (PNDI-2T) in the IP direction. This observation indicated that the ordered polymer and small-molecule structures may not have affected each other in the blend film. Furthermore in the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T film, the PNDI-2T d-spacing of the (010) peak in the OOP direction was retained, and its scattering distance was also reduced (3.77 Å) compared to that of the neat PNDI-2T film. The reduction of the π–π stacking distance in the blend system reflected its increased intermolecular interactions. In general, the higher the degree of crystallinity, the more effective the charge carrier transport and exciton dissociation, and thus the higher the FF.
2.4 Solar cell stability
Although the efficiency of the PNDI-2T OSCs was still poorer than those of the PC71BM devices, the PNDI-2T OSCs showed surprising thermal stability in terms of the degree to which the initial efficiency level was maintained. Such thermal stability is an essential issue for commercially applied OSCs. We investigated the thermal stability of the PC71BM device as well as that of the PNDI-2T acceptor device (Table 2 and Fig. 3). The thermal degradation tests were carried out inside a glovebox, by keeping the devices on a hotplate at 100 °C, 150 °C, and 250 °C and measuring their photovoltaic performance at defined intervals of time, to register the trend of the OPV parameters. Each device was tested with various durations of annealing (0 h, 2 h, and 15 h) at 150 °C. Through the DSC measurements (Fig. S1†), Tg whether it be through diffusion and demixing, degradation of the bulk materials or interface-related processes, was already determined to be 160 °C and 225 °C for PC71BM and PNDI-2T devices, respectively. To compare the thermal stability between PC71BM and PNDI-2T, within not more than PC71BM and PNDI-2T Tg values, we tested thermal stability at 150 °C.

(d) PL spectra of the BDT2TR:PC71BM film and BDT2TR:PNDI-2T film with different thermal ageing times at 150 °C. 
For the PC71BM system, annealing at 150 °C for 2 h dramatically decreased the PCE from 8.20% to 3.94%. After 15 h, the device PCE was 2.75%, i.e., it retained only 33% of its initial PCE. In contrast, the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device maintained 93% of its initial PCE after 15 h, i.e., its PCE dropped only a little, from 4.43% to 4.15%. The J–V curves and summarized photovoltaic parameters of these devices are shown in Fig. 3a and b and Table 2.
As shown in Table 2, the photovoltaic performance of BDT2TR:PC71BM device quickly dropped with different annealing time from 0 h to 15 h, especially considerable drop in its JSC and FF. In contrast, the JSC and FF values for the PNDI-2T acceptor system device thermally processed for 15 h decreased only slightly. This indicates that the decomposition in the PC71BM blend film is more facile to occur than that in the PNDI-2T blend system due to intrinsic Tg values. Additionally, we also tested thermal stability at 100 °C and 250 °C (Fig. S8, S9, and Tables S3 and S4†). It was observed that the PCE of the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device tested at 100 °C maintained 97% of its initial value for up to 24 h from 4.35% to 4.24%. However, the BDT2TR:PC71BM – based device retained 72% of the PCE as compared with the initial PCE of 8.17%. When processing thermal stress at 250 °C (above the Tg of PNDI-2T), both PNDI-2T and PC71BM based devices, show sharply declined PCE even only annealing for 10 min. A decrease in the entire PCE happens by degradation of both molecules at that temperature. The BDT2TR:PNDI-2T devices demonstrated better operational thermal stability than the BDT2TR:PC71BM device. Note that the thermal annealing process can induce lower hole and electron mobilities, and greater chances of recombination. We also determined the charge carrier mobility values of the PC71BM and PNDI-2T devices after they were subjected to thermal annealing, as summarized in Table 2 and Fig. S6.† After being subjected to thermal stress, the BDT2TR:PC71BM device showed a μh of 1.87 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 2.51 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, indicating poor hole/electron mobilities resulting from the thermal stress. This decrease may have contributed to the decrease of JSC and FF. In contrast, the hole and electron mobilities of the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device thermally annealed at 150 °C for 15 h were measured to be 1.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.42 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, i.e., quite similar to those of the pristine device. This result was attributed to the excellent thermal stability of the device. Additionally the relationship between the charge carrier recombination and BHJ photo-active layer with thermal stress was determined as shown in Fig. 3c and S7.† According to the acquired J–V curves, the PC71BM device subjected to thermal processing showed poor saturation at all light intensities between 3.2 and 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. S7†), indicating more chances for recombination near the VOC region. In contrast, the photocurrent of the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device showed sufficient saturation regardless of the thermal treatment, indicative of its more efficient charge transport and less recombination.28Fig. 3c shows the relationship between the JSC and light intensity (Plight) for each of the devices. Note that these parameters can be related by the expression JSC ∝ (Plight)α, where α is an exponential factor that is close to unity depending on the extent of bimolecular recombination. Upon thermal annealing, the α of the PC71BM device decreased from 0.96 to 0.91, and this decrease was attributed to bimolecular recombination. Although the α value of the PNDI-2T device was calculated to be lower than that of the PC71BM device, it did not decrease significantly over the course of the thermal treatment, indicative of the high thermal tolerance of the PNDI-2T device and its suppression of bimolecular recombination. Furthermore, RSH also decreased as the PC71BM device was subjected to thermal stress, indicating a high recombination of generated charge carriers, which resulted in leakage current and implied the characteristic of the defects. In contrast, the RSH of the PNDI-2T device was well maintained, confirming the good suppression of recombination in this device and retention of its photovoltaic performance. In addition, PL quenching was measured in order to investigate photo-induced exciton behavior after thermal ageing. These measurements provided additional clear evidence for the poor thermal stability of the PC71BM device. Over 90% of the generated excitons in the BDT2TR:PC71BM device were dissociated before employing thermal processing, while only 50% of the excitons were separated into holes and electrons after thermal annealing. It is indicated that effective exciton quenching did not occur at the BDT2TR-PC71BM interface. In contrast, the pre-processed and thermally processed PNDI-2T acceptor films showed nearly identical PL spectral patterns (Fig. 3d). We attributed this stability to the well-ordered intermolecular stacking of this film as well as the ordered structure of its photo-active layer. Taken together, the above results for the PNDI-2T acceptor device, including the high retention of its initial PCE, may be ascribed to its excellent thermal stability.
To further investigate the effect of thermal stress applied to these devices on the morphologies of their surfaces and bulk, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) investigations were carried out. The AFM and TEM images shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that the PC71BM blend device with exposure to thermal stress at 150 °C showed highly degraded surface as compared with pristine BDT2TR:PC71BM film, which showed critical cracks with tough surface film as 1.99 of root mean square (RMS). The apparent degradation was attributed to a low Tg, which apparently allowed molecular aggregation to occur easily. Consequently, the morphological changes resulting from thermal ageing apparently eliminated carrier transport pathways, and hence reduced JSC and FF. In contrast, the phase AFM and TEM images of the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T film indicated no dramatic changes in its morphology from thermal exposure. This result was attributed to the greater flexibility of its molecular components and the stronger interface, resulting from the entanglements between its small-molecule donor and polymer acceptor, than that found for fullerene (the polymer acceptor showed a higher Tg than fullerene). In addition, the surface of the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T film was actually smoother after annealing than before: its RMS roughness decreased from 2.06 nm to 1.71 nm. These results were attributed to the fact that the high-Tg (around 225 °C) PNDI-2T acceptor is highly crystalline and rigid, and less susceptible to degradation compared to PC71BM (Tg ∼ 160 °C).

To investigate the operational device stability under light and air, furthermore, inverted devices were fabricated under optimized processing conditions. The inverted device architecture is ITO/ZnO/PEIE/BDT2TR:PC71BM or PNDI-2T/MoOX/Ag, to rule out the influence of the degradation of a low work function electrode (Ca/Al) on the photovoltaic performance. For the photostability test, we kept the device under continuous illumination (AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2) with glass to glass encapsulation for 200 h. The device performance was periodically measured and initial photovoltaic properties extracted from Fig. S10† are summarized in Table S5.† Fig. S11† shows the evolution of the photovoltaic properties of the BDT2TR:PC71BM or PNDI-2T inverted solar cells. As shown in Fig. S11,† the light stress leads to significant degradation in the performance of all OSCs, and the effect of continuous illumination on the photovoltaic performance is most sensitive in the sol–gel ZnO-BDT2TR:PC71BM device, which exhibits a decrease in PCE to 80% of its initial performance after exposure to light for 200 h. The sol–gel ZnO-BDT2TR:PNDI-2T solar cell also caused substantial degradation due to light exposure (roughly ∼ 70% decline of the initial PCE). In contrast, the ZnO NPs-BDT2TR:PC71CM and – BDT2TR:PNDI-2T solar cells retained nearly 80% PCE of their original values within 200 h. The reason why the difference happens depending on the type of ZnO might be that the sol–gel ZnO has more possibility to form interfacial defects between the photo-active material and ZnO interface.
In addition to the photostability, the OSCs need to guarantee ambient stability. The air stability of BDT2TR:PC71BM and BDT2TR:PNDI-2T devices was studied by keeping them out of the glove box without encapsulation. Devices were stored at room temperature, under dark conditions for 10 days (Fig. S12, S13, and Tables S6 and S7†). After 10 days in air and under dark conditions, the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device retained nearly 96% of its PCE (3.77% in ZnO NPs and 3.92% in ZnO sol–gel) and the BDT2TR:PC71BM device retained 96% PCE (6.29% in ZnO NPs and 7.02% in ZnO sol–gel). This phenomenon demonstrates that the operational photostability of OSCs has severe influence on the photovoltaic performance compared to the air stability.
2.5 Thickness dependence
To study the effect of the thickness of the photo-active layer on the device performance of the PC71BM and PNDI-2T acceptor OSCs, various versions of each device, with different photo-active layer thicknesses, were fabricated.29 First, to examine the cross-sectional morphology of the photo-active layers, cross-sectional SEM and TEM images were acquired for the full device architecture with thick photo-active layers (Fig. 5a, b and S15†).27 The spherically shaped PC71BM molecules were observed to be embedded into the small-molecule donor region, indicating good intermixing of the domain phases. However the PC71BM may have been limiting the photovoltaic performance of the thick films by promoting the formation of large aggregates.31 Such aggregates would have likely shortened the average lifetime of the free carriers, or decreased the carrier mobility because of trapping or recombination as indicated by the FF. As a result, the PC71BM device with a thick photo-active layer showed poor photovoltaic properties, specifically with VOC = 0.88 V, JSC = 14.16 mA cm−2, FF = 48%, and PCE = 6.04% for a thickness of 360 nm (see Fig. 5a, b, S14 and Table S8†). On the other hand, the PNDI-2T device showed good thickness tolerance. The cross-sectional SEM image of this device (Fig. 5b) showed the PNDI-2T acceptor to be entangled with the BDT2TR donor, which can strengthen the interface. The BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device thus showed reasonable efficiency even with a high photo-active layer thickness of ∼610 nm: at this thickness, the device displayed a PCE of 3.67%, VOC of 0.86 V, JSC of 6.18 mA cm−2, and FF of 69%. The maintenance of photovoltaic performance values over a wide range of thicknesses by the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device but not the PC71BM device was apparently due to the highly ordered crystalline structure of the PNDI-2T acceptor and relatively disordered PC71BM in their respective photo-active layers as mentioned above. Because the PNDI-2T acceptor was arranged in a wholly face-on orientation with strong π–π stacking and multiple order lamellar packing, the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device had favorable morphology for bi-continuous interpenetrating network even with a thicker active layer as much as 610 nm. Therefore, it is beneficial to generate effective exciton dissociation and charge transport to each electrode leading to high FF. Although the PCE resulting from this polymer acceptor was observed to be less than that of the PC71BM device, the PNDI-2T device showed a better-maintained performance over a wide range of photo-active layer thicknesses than the PC71BM device due to the molecular entanglement and the well-oriented crystalline structures. Most notably, the FF of the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device with a very thick, i.e., 610 nm thick, photo-active layer was quite high, 69%, only a bit less than that with a thin layer; in contrast, the FF of the PC71BM device with a thick (360 nm) layer was 48%, much reduced relative to that of the thin-layered device. To understand the recombination mechanism involved in the BDT2TR:PC71BM and PNDI-2T OSCs with very thick photo-active layers, their photocurrent density (Jph) values were obtained (Fig. 5d). Here, photocurrent was defined as JL − JD, with JL and JD being the current density under illumination and in the dark, respectively.32 The thick PNDI-2T device displayed a quickly saturated photocurrent, which suggested that this system had zero net trapped charges and that the electric field was uniform throughout the photo-active layer.35 In contrast the PC71BM became fully saturated at a reverse voltage higher than that of the PNDI-2T device. These results implied that Jph in this case was more sensitive to the electric field and required a more powerful electric field to sweep out the generated charge carriers without recombination.33 Thus, effective charge dissociation and collection occurred even for the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T OSC containing a thick photo-active layer, but not so for the thick-layered PC71BM device, indicating a higher photo-generated exciton dissociation and more effective charge collection, resulting from minimizing carrier recombination, for the PNDI-2T device than for the PC71BM device. This result was consistent with the charge dissociation probability P(E,T), defined as Jph/JSC.36 The P(E,T) values for the PC71BM and PNDI-2T devices under a JSC were calculated to be 91% and 96%, respectively. The relatively high P(E,T) value for the PNDI-2T device implied that efficient exciton dissociation occurred at its donor–acceptor interface and that geminate recombination was negligible. This high P(E,T) value was probably due to PNDI-2T having outstanding mechanical characteristics resulting from the entangled polymer chains contributing a favorable morphology with a large interfacial area and good mixing of the small-molecule and polymer acceptor domains. This factor is an important requirement for flexible devices.

2.6 Flexible device bending test
To assess the potential of these blends in flexible device applications,34 we fabricated flexible OSCs and determined their morphological and performance properties at various bending radii of curvature, with the bending radius of curvature for each case measured between two end points of an arc in the flexible devices (after 100 bending cycles, manually).
The J–V curves and PCE values for various bending radii are shown in Fig. 6a and Table S9.†21 The photovoltaic performance of a highly bent PC71BM device film with a bending radius of 80 mm was considerably poorer than that for the film not bent as much with a bending radius of 140 mm after 100 bending cycles (times). Especially, the more the film was bent, the more the FF dropped. This deterioration in performance was apparently due to the morphology of this film being degraded, as observed in optical microscopy images (Fig. 6c), with the appearance of surface cracks. This degradation was attributed to the combination of sharp bending and the weak entanglements with the small-molecule chains. In contrast, there was no large change in the morphological properties of the PNDI-2T device upon bending. Moreover, the photovoltaic parameters of this device did not change much between unbent and bent states: the PCE was 3.99% for the unbent device and 3.20% for that with a bending radius of 80 mm. As shown in Fig. 6b and c, the photovoltaic performances and optical microscopy images of the photo-active films exhibited a clear correlation, indicating no significant differences between the unbent BDT2TR:PNDI-2T film and that under mechanical stress. Furthermore, to investigate the correlation between the bending test and morphological roughness, the surface profile was obtained (Fig. S16†).41 With decreasing the bending radius from infinite to 80 mm, Ra, the arithmetical mean of the absolute values of the surface departures from the mean plane within the sampling area, increases which means that the morphology of blend films becomes a much rougher surface. However, the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device values indicate a more stable surface change as compared with the BDT2TR:PC71BM system. These results showed PNDI-2T to have yielded a good level of tolerance to bending pressure, with its superior mechanical strength apparently due to the good entanglements of PNDI-2T with the small-molecule donor materials. These results indicate the promise of polymer acceptor-based OSCs for application as flexible power generators.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated a highly efficient and stable small-molecule donor and non-fullerene polymer solar cell that specifically utilized BDT2TR as a donor and PNDI-2T as an acceptor. This system exhibited a high solar cell performance, with a PCE of 4.43%, which is one of the best efficiency values reported for such systems made up of a small-molecule donor and a polymer acceptor. Despite its photovoltaic properties having been observed to be poorer than those of the corresponding PC71BM system, it has far superior thermal and mechanical stability. When exposed to a temperature of 150 °C for 15 h, the stability of the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T OSC was found to be superior to that of fullerene OSCs due to the high Tg of the polymer. The PCE of the thermally treated BDT2TR:PNDI-2T OSC was 4.15%, only a bit less than the 4.43% value of the untreated BDT2TR:PNDI-2T OSC, and their morphologies were similar, with these results attributed to the lack of aggregation of photo-active materials during the thermal treatment. In addition, for BDT2TR:PNDI-2T, the 610 nm-thick photo-active layers and the thin layers showed similar morphologies, with highly ordered nanoscale structures, which are beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport. More importantly, the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T device could be used in flexible applications. The enhanced flexibility of the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T system was mainly attributed to the polymer being entangled to a relatively high extent with other molecules, thus creating tightened interactions. These results indicate that the BDT2TR:PNDI-2T system has more potential in manufacturing processes and practical applications.
