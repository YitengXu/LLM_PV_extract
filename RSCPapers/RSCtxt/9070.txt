    , Accepted 3rd February 2020First published on 5th February 2020AbstractThe clean and renewable “hydrogen energy economy” era is coming. In this regard, the pathway for hydrogen production is of utmost importance. Recently, diligent urea (CO(NH2)2) electrolysis has been explored as a promising energy-saving avenue for sustainable hydrogen production in comparison with conventional water (H2O) electrolysis because of the low cell voltage, remediation of urea-rich wastewater and abundant electrocatalysts. Numerous non-precious materials (especially nickel-based ones) show potential as electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis in alkaline media and massive efforts are underway to improve the kinetics and thermodynamics. In this review, we firstly introduce the fundamentals of the energy-saving urea electrolysis system. Next, the recent advances with electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis are summarized. Then, the relationship between structure and activity is discussed. Finally, the remaining challenges and the future outlook are pointed out for the development of advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts, new approaches for catalyst synthesis, solar-driven urea electrolysis and electrocatalytic mechanisms for Ni-free catalysts.Xiujuan SunXiujuan Sun received her Ph.D. degree in Physical Chemistry from Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2015.

1. Introduction
Hydrogen (H2) is considered to be a promising green energy carrier because of its high efficiency (gravimetric energy density is about 142 MJ kg−1), earth-abundance and environmental friendliness (water (H2O) is the only product).1,2 Water electrolysis is a quite old but promising pathway for hydrogen generation, benefiting from plentiful water feedstocks, environmental friendliness, and high purity.3–6
Typically, water electrolysis consists of two half-reactions: the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The thermodynamic voltage for water decomposition is about 1.23 V, and the actual operating voltage is usually above 1.8 V owing to the sluggish kinetics of both the HER and the OER, the resistances from the electrode materials and electrolytes, and the contact resistance between the electrode and the electrolyte.7–10 To this end, several effective solutions have been proposed: (1) choosing proper electrocatalysts to boost the slow kinetics;11,12 (2) optimizing the electrolyzer structure to reduce the resistance; and (3) replacing the OER with other more favorable anodic reactions.13,14
Recently, substituting the OER with other more easily oxidized substances has attracted great attention, such as alcohols, hydrazine, amine, urea and aldehyde.15–20 Among them, the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has attracted considerable attention because of the far-lower theoretical thermodynamic potential (−0.46 V vs. SHE). The cost of hydrogen production from urea electrolysis is reported to be 36% lower compared with that of water electrolysis and uses 30% less energy.21
As well as the low working voltage, urea also has the favorable characteristics of abundance, low cost, safety and convenient transportation. Urea can be obtained from industry production (N-containing fertilizer) and human/animal urine (toilet wastewater). It has been reported that over 80% of wastewater is directly dumped into the environment every year.22 Without rational and specific handling, urea can decompose naturally, releasing ammonia and nitrate, causing severe environmental pollution and eutrophication of water.23–25 Therefore, launching urea electrolysis kills two birds with one stone: more efficient hydrogen production and addressing the problem of urea-containing wastewater. Note that a urea molecule ((CO(NH2)2)) contains 6.67 wt% H element and H2O is one product of the UOR,26,27 which means that urea is a promising hydrogen carrier that can be exploited as a future raw material for fuel cells.
The UOR goes through a six-electron process. The slow reaction kinetics and high overpotential limit its further application in urea electrolysis, while most of the UOR electrocatalysts exhibit monofunctionality with low activity for the HER. These shortcomings may be conquered by developing high-efficiency UOR/HER bifunctional electrocatalysts. In this review, we summarize the recent breakthroughs with electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis for hydrogen production via the energy-saving pathway, including nickel-based and nickel-free materials. We also highlight the challenges and future perspectives for urea electrolysis, e.g. sunlight-powered photochemical and asymmetric urea electrolysis systems.
2. Fundamentals for hydrogen production via urea electrolysis in alkaline media
2.1 Fundamentals of theoretical thermodynamics
In 2009, Boggs et al. collected pure hydrogen from the cathode and nitrogen from the anode using a urea-containing alkaline solution or urine by applying a 1.5 V voltage in a Hoffman apparatus.28 Under standard conditions, the theoretical thermodynamic potential for the UOR is about −0.46 V vs. SHE and −0.83 V vs. SHE for the HER. Therefore, the theoretical thermodynamic overall cell voltage for urea electrolysis is 0.37 V, much lower than that of H2O electrolysis (1.23 V). The working principle for urea electrolysis in alkaline media is described in Fig. 1. Two half-reactions occur in this system: the HER at the cathode and the UOR at the anode. For the anode, 1 mole of CO(NH2)2 molecular reacts with 6 moles of hydroxyl ions (OH−) to produce N2, H2O and bicarbonate (CO32−), while molecular H2O goes through a reduction process and H2 is obtained at the cathode. Generally, the overall reactions of urea electrolysis produce N2, H2 and CO32− in alkaline media. The reactions for the UOR, the HER and overall urea electrolysis are depicted in eqn (1)–(3). Anode: CO(NH2)2 + 6OH− → N2 + 5H2O + CO32− + 6e−φ = −0.46 V vs. SHE(1) Cathode: 6H2O + 6e− → 3H2 + 6OH−φ = −0.83 V vs. SHE(2) Overall: CO(NH2)2 + H2O → N2 + 3H2 + CO32−E = 0.37 V(3)

2.2 The reaction mechanisms for the UOR in alkaline media
According to eqn (1)–(3), the theoretical voltage for the overall urea electrolysis in alkaline media is 0.37 V, suggesting that the as-proposed alkaline electrolyzer can theoretically produce H2. Although the practical electrolyzer still needs a high voltage to drive urea electrolysis for H2 production, the energy input for H2 production could still be greatly reduced compared with traditional H2O electrolysis because the UOR can be catalyzed by non-expensive catalysts in alkaline media. Botte's group firstly conducted related work and made a great contribution to this field.23,29–31 Intensive calculations and experiments, especially in situ Raman spectra (RS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) characterizations of the UOR process, gave an in-depth understanding of the UOR on the surface of NiOOH. Combined with electrochemical results, they confirmed that NiOOH is the electroactive species for the UOR and denoted it as an electrooxidation–chemical oxidation (E–C) mechanism,29–31 as shown in eqn (4) and (5): Electrooxidation: 6Ni(OH)2 + 6OH− → 6NiOOH + 6H2O + 6e−(4) Chemical oxidation: CO(NH2)2 + 6NiOOH + H2O → N2 + CO2 + 6Ni(OH)2(5)
In their studies, Ni (OH)2 was first electrooxidized to NiOOH in the presence of OH−, and then urea molecules adsorb on the NiOOH via bridging coordination, whereby a Ni atom interacts with N and O while an O atom from NiOOH interacts with a urea C. In other words, the onset potential for the UOR is the potential for the formation of NiOOH via Ni electrooxidation. The next dissociation of urea on NiOOH is a multistep process, generating various intermediate species, such as *CO(NH2)2, *CO(NH·NH2), *CO(NH·NH), *CO(NH·N), *CO(N2), *CO(OH), *CO–(OH·OH) and *COO. By studying the Gibbs energy and the resistance of each step, they found that the rate-limiting step is the desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the Ni interspaces (Table 1).

The smart utilization of in situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy during the electrochemical UOR test offers direct observation of the intermediates. As demonstrated by Wang,32 the changes of the adsorption intensities of CO2 and CNO− generated on a Ni–WC catalyst for urea electrooxidation could be detected by real-time FT-IR. When the potential went below 0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO, no significant adsorption peaks could be seen, then as the potential scanned to a more positive direction, peaks at 1640, 1740, 1380 and 1234 cm−1 assigned to OH−, C–N, CO32− and HCO3−, respectively, appeared. Most importantly, the detection of NCO was confirmed when the positive band at 2168 cm−1 was disclosed. This work gives straightforward evidence to verify the composition of the UOR intermediates in basic solution.
2.3 Requirements for substances
As can be seen, N2, H2 and CO2 are released under the process of urea electrolysis, but their adsorption on the surface of the electrocatalyst not only blocks the channels connecting the active sites and reactants but also forces the catalyst to exfoliate from the electrode. Notably, the intermediate product CO gas could cover up the surface of the catalyst, leading to reduced hydrogen production efficiency. To overcome the problems mentioned above and optimize the catalyst activity, nickel foam (NF), Ti foil and carbon cloth have been selected as substances to combine with catalysts.33,34
NF's three-dimensional (3D) skeleton with macroporous morphology, high mechanical strength and excellent conductivity make it promising for use as an effective alternative to the traditional glassy carbon (GC) electrode in the urea electrolysis system. One popular way is the in situ growth method, in which the catalyst is directly grown on the NF and further used as an electrode. This method avoids the utilization of a binder and conductive agents, ensuring rich active sites and facilitating mass and electron transfer.33,35
Although NF has been shown to make a negligible contribution to the enhancement of the UOR from electrochemical measurements compared to the host component, it is inevitably oxidized into high valance states (Ni2+/Ni3+) in alkaline media during the UOR. Therefore, it is hard to say if NF affects the catalytic activity, so more work should be done on this topic.
3. Electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis in alkaline media
As depicted in eqn (1), the UOR is a six-electron transfer process with intrinsic slow kinetic and complex gas evolution steps. Therefore, to realize hydrogen production from overall urea electrolysis, two of the prerequisites are to reduce the overpotential and accelerate the reaction rate for the UOR. As a matter of fact, noble platinum (Pt) was the earliest electrocatalyst to be applied to urea by electrooxidation method, as early as the 1970s, in the field of biochemistry sensors and medical treatment on artificial kidney dialysis in acid buffers.36–38 Recently, non-precious and highly efficient nickel-based electrocatalysts in the form of metallic Ni, Ni-base alloys, oxides/hydroxides, phosphides, chalcogenides and nitrides have received great attention for the UOR to reduce the cost and accelerate the kinetic progress. On the other hand, Co-, Cu-, Mn- and Fe-based catalysts have also been investigated as mono-functional or bifunctional catalysts. Recent progress with transition metal catalysts has shown the bright future of H2 production from urea electrolysis. From the respect of reducing cost, bifunctional catalysts are more favorable for accomplishing the overall splitting process, because they can simplify the electrode preparation process. Herein, we focus on UOR anodic catalysts but do not distinguish if they work as bifunctional catalysts and divide them into two categories: nickel-based catalysts and nickel-free catalysts.
3.1 Monometallic nickel (Ni) and Ni alloy
The idea of using metallic Ni as a highly efficient catalyst for UOR comes from urease: a Ni-containing enzyme.39 As early as 2003, Suarez analyzed urea catalysis by urease enzymes through quantum chemical calculations and put forward that Ni is the active site for urea hydrolysis. Metallic Ni was firstly used as an electrocatalyst for the UOR of urea electrolysis in a study by G.G. Botte.28 In a Hoffman electrolysis apparatus, the anode electrocatalyst was Ni while the cathode material was pure Pt and the electrolyte was 5.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea. When applying a voltage of 1.5 V to the electrolyzer, they observed a 20 mA current, much higher than that without urea under the same conditions. They suggested that at 1.5 V, pure water could not be electrolyzed, but the addition of urea fulfills hydrogen production and Ni is active for the UOR. Since metallic Ni has also long been well-known as an efficient alkaline HER catalyst,40–43 Wang et al. prepared pomegranate-like Ni/C from multivariate metal–organic frameworks (Zn/Ni) and investigated their HER and UOR catalytic performance in 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M KOH + 0.33 M urea.44 The super-low overpotentials to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for both the HER (40 mV) and the UOR (1.33 V vs. RHE) make Ni/C a suitable bifunctional catalyst for overall urea electrolysis. The hydrogen generated from this two-electrode urea electrolyzer by the Ni/C bifunctional electrocatalyst is about 52 times higher than that of the water electrolyzer under the same conditions.
Ni alloy electrocatalysts often bear better catalytic activity compared to their individual metal counterparts because of the strong coupling effect between Ni and the neighboring metals and the tuneable electron structure. A second element may provide additional active sites for the adsorption/desorption of intermediates and free Ni sites to furnish the catalytic activity.45–47 Very recently, bimetallic Ni–Pd nanoparticles with equal Ni/Pd mass loading (10 wt% for both Ni and Pd) incorporated on ordered mesoporous carbon (Ni(10%)Pd(10%)/OMC) were prepared by co-infiltration and high-temperature reduction method under H2/Ar. Ni(10%)Pd(10%)/OMC showed extraordinary performance towards the UOR and the HER.48 The two-electrode urea electrolysis system only needed 1.468 V to attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 when Ni(10%)Pd(10%)/OMC was applied as a bifunctional catalyst. The main reason for the high performance is the high conductivity, the mesoporous structure of OMC and the introduction of thin Pd nanoparticles into Ni, which lower the charge transfer resistance. Different from Pt, another noble metal of Rh was shown to be able to reduce the surface blocking caused by the intermediate product CO in NiRh alloy during the UOR and enhance the stability for the overall splitting.49 Considering the scarcity and high price of these noble metals, Ni-based alloys with low price, high abundance and strong transition metals are put forward.
Ni and Mo are located at two sides of Trasatti's HER volcano plot, which enables NiMo alloy to display excellent HER performance.50 On the other hand, Mo has a strong interaction with CO, which is beneficial for relieving the CO poisoning of Ni active sites during the UOR.51–53 Taking advantage of these two facts, a NiMo nanotube array has been reported as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to catalyze the HER and UOR in an alkaline electrolyte by Zhang.54 It achieved a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a potential of −44 mV for the HER in 1.0 M KOH, close to the state-of-the-art Pt/C (Fig. 2a), and much higher than their corresponding precursor and NF (Fig. 2b). As for the UOR, it needs 1.36 V to achieve 10 mA cm−2 with 1.0 M KOH and 0.1 M urea (Fig. 2c). It is worthwhile to note that the current densities of NiMo nanotubes and the NiMo precursor are always much higher than that of commercial RuO2/C, indicating the excellent UOR performance. At the same time, the smallest resistance of NiMo nanotubes obtained from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test also confirms the fast charge transfer capacity (Fig. 2d). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that Mo is responsible for the chemical adsorption and O–H bond breaking while Ni is the active site for hydrogen evolution. Based on these results, they constructed a urea electrolysis cell consisting of NiMo nanotubes as both the anode and the cathode to realize overall urea electrolysis and found that the cell only needed about 1.43 V to deliver 10 mA cm−2, much lower than traditional water electro-splitting (1.59 V) (Fig. 2e). Note that this cell voltage (1.43 V) is also lower than that for an electrolyzer assembled using a state-of-art Pt&IrO2 couple, which needed 1.47 V in 1.0 M KOH and 0.1 M urea solution to drive 10 mA cm−2. A stability test of the cell under J = 10 mA cm−2 showed negligible decay during 10 h of operation (Fig. 2f).

3.2 Ni-Based oxides/hydroxides
No matter what the existing format of Ni is, the real active site for the UOR occurring on Ni is high valance Ni3+ (mostly in the form of NiOOH in alkaline media). Previous reports demonstrated that high valance state transition metals bearing a low 3d energy state could enhance the metal–oxygen interaction and facilitate the adsorption/desorption of intermediates on metal.25 From this consideration, nickel-based oxide/hydroxide electrocatalysts that easily convert into NiOOH have been developed but are sometimes limited by the intrinsic low conductivity and insufficient active sites.55,56 A hierarchical Ni(OH)2nanosheet@nanowire configuration on Ni foam (Ni(OH)2NS@NW/NF) as an excellent UOR catalyst is produced via a hydrothermal method and subsequent annealing process.57 In a urea electrolytic system with Ni(OH)2NS@NW/NF as the anode and Co2P NW/NF as the cathode, hydrogen bubbles are obviously observed on the cathode, which means the OER can be replaced by the UOR. Actually, this hybrid system only requires 1.58 V to deliver a current density of 5 mA cm−2. More interestingly, when shifting from battery to solar power, the hybrid cell still works well: H2 and N2 bubbles are generated on the cathode and anode, respectively (Fig. 3). This solar-powered way is more energy-saving and may be more feasible for daily application.

Element incorporation is another powerful strategy to modify the electron structure of Ni(OH)2 to facilitate charge transfer and modulate the adsorption energy of the intermediates. Theory and experiments show that the introduction of a transition metal into Ni(OH)2 could greatly increase either the HER or UOR performance due to a synergetic effect or the modified electron structure, but the detailed mechanism for the guest metal is different.46,58–60 The six most abundant metals of the Earth's crust are used for making catalysts for the HER (W = Mo < Co < Cu < Ni ≪ Fe),59 and actually they are also often used in UOR catalysts.
NiCo2O4 is a typical AB2O4 spinel structure with abundant divalent and trivalent cations co-existing and shows excellent HER and UOR performance.60,61 The actual role of Fe in Ni0.9Fe0.1Ox catalysts for UOR was disclosed by Shi.62 As indicated by DFT, the bandgap of NiO became smaller after introducing Fe, thus facilitating the electron transfer for UOR (Fig. 4). The as-prepared Ni0.9Fe0.1Ox microspheres exhibited excellent catalytic activity towards both the HER and the UOR and the voltage for overall urea electrolysis was 1.455 V to attain 10 mA cm−2. Xie et al. explored the UOR, OER and HER performance on Cu:α-Ni(OH)2 hierarchical wire-on-sheet nanoarrays in alkaline solution.63 They believe that the unique structure (abundant active sites, conductive skeleton and buffer space avoiding volume change when Ni2+ was oxidized to Ni3+) and Cu doping amount (1% Cu is optimal) are responsible for the excellent activity. Besides, the in situ generated Ni3+ ions are the main reason for the low onset potential during the UOR process and the generated Cu0 is the origin of the enhanced HER compared to the counterparts without Cu.

Another representative work was developed by Yu.64 NiMoO–Ar and NiMoO–H2 with efficient HER and UOR performance were prepared by annealing NiMoO·xH2O under the protection of pure Ar or H2/Ar. A two-electrode alkaline urea electrolyzer composed of a NiMoO–Ar anode and a NiMoO–H2 cathode required a small voltage of merely 1.38 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 compared to that of ordinary water splitting. The urea electrolyzer performed very stably, with about 96.6% current retained after continuous operation at 100 mA cm−2 for 50 h. XPS analysis of NiMoO–Ar illustrated that high valance Ni2+ and Mo6+ are the main surface species while NiMoO–H2 contains low valance state Ni0, Mo3+ and Mo4+ (Fig. 5). Electrocatalytic activity investigation demonstrated that lower oxidation states of Ni0 and Mo3+, Mo4+ are responsible for the HER while higher Ni2+ and Mo6+ oxidation states contributed to the UOR.

3.3 Ni-Based chalcogenides
Relatively few NiSx catalysts have been reported for the alkaline HER but their application in the UOR is ongoing.25,65,66 Liu et al. demonstrated that Ni3S2@NF displays both elegant HER and UOR properties in 1.0 M NaOH in the presence of 0.33 M urea.67 The corresponding overall urea electrolysis system using Ni3S2@NF as both the anode and cathode electrodes gave a current density of 20 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of only 1.49 V with excellent longevity (no damping of the voltage over 10 h of electrolysis). The transition metal tellurides NiTe and NiTe2 were also found to have good HER and UOR performance by Wang.68 As they reported, NiTe was formed during H2/Ar gas treatment at 450 °C by reaction between a telluride (Te) source and GO-coated NF (NiTe/rGO/NF) while NiTe2 was obtained using NF alone (NiTe2/NF) in the same process. Although the chemical states of Ni and Te are the same, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectronic spectra (XPS), NiTe and NiTe2 exhibit different crystal structures. NiTe belongs to melonite and NiTe2 is imgreite, which results in different UOR performances. From the electrochemical experiments, they concluded that NiTe/rGO/NF displays a smaller overpotential for 10 mA cm−2, smaller Tafel slope and stronger stability for the HER and the UOR in alkaline media. The overall urea-splitting electrolyzer (NiTe/rGO/NF//NiTe/rGO/NF) generated 50 mA cm−2 current density with a voltage 1.61 V compared to about 1.86 V for pure water splitting. Furthermore, they applied the NiTe/rGO/NF//NiTe/rGO/NF electrolyzer to the electrolysis of real human urine; although the onset potential and the current density were inferior to those with a man-made KOH–urea solution, plenty of bubbles at the cathode could be observed. This means that the NiTe/rGO/NF//NiTe/rGO/NF electrolyzer has potential for hydrogen production from practical wastewater treatment. As the annual production of urine far exceeds the desired urea market, the realization of generation production from urine by electrolysis with non-precious catalysts would bring great opportunities to develop the clean energy economy.
The outstanding UOR performance on NiTe and NiTe2 was unveiled by DFT calculation (Fig. 6). Results from the corresponding simulations show that the bandgap of NiTe is zero, endowing NiTe with metallic characteristics (ultrahigh conductivity). More information about the d-band state verified that the d-band state of Ni was located at the same level as the p-band of Te, and the CO2 adsorption on the HO–NiTe (101) surface (0.27 V) is lower than that of NiTe2 (011) (0.35 V).

To further optimize the catalytic performance of the mono-Ni component chalcogenides (NiSx), other transition metals have been introduced into NiSx. Inspired by the superior catalytic activity toward the overall water splitting of NiFe-based materials, Wang fabricated a bimetallic iron–nickel sulfide nanowall array supported on nickel foam (Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/NF) and explored its overall urea-splitting activity.69 A much lower voltage (1.46 V) was needed to sustain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 compared to the urea-free counterpart (1.60 V) using Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam as a bifunctional electrode, which demonstrates its high efficiency for H2 generation in a UOR–HER system. To analyze the real active sites, they investigated the XPS spectra of Ni and Fe before and after the electrolysis and found that a peak at 858 eV ascribed to NiOOH appeared after the UOR. Based on the results, they inferred the role of Fe and the active sites: (1) Fe3+ facilitates the conductivity of the as-prepared catalysts; (2) the generated Fe–NiOOH/Fe with high valance state Ni is the UOR active site. Besides the bimetallic sulfides, NiSx heterojunction hybrids with other transition metal chalcogenides have also been studied, such as heteroporous MoS2/Ni3S2.70 Notably, according to the DFT calculations, the interface between Ni3S2 and MoS2 decreases the Gibbs free energy for the UOR. The generated intermediate species NH* during the UOR process is prone to be adsorbed on MoS2 rather than Ni3S2 while CO* is prone to bond with Ni3S2 (Fig. 7). Considering the merits of the heteroporous structure and the distinctive alkali HER performance of MoS2/Ni3S2, a urea electrolysis cell with MoS2/Ni3S2 as the anode and cathode electrodes showed superior electrocatalytic performance in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea (the cell voltage was about 1.45 V to delivery 20 mA cm−2) as well as long-term stability for 20 h, which is among the best bifunctional urea-splitting catalysts.

Other Ni-based chalcogenides, spinel structure NiCo2S4 on carbon cloth,71 and hierarchical coral-like NiMoS nanohybrids (HC-NiMoS/Ti)72 also present excellent catalytic activity and long-term stability in the hybrid urea electrolyzer hydrogen production system. Sun compared the UOR performance of HC-NiMoS/Ti, 2D-NiMoS/Ti, 2D-NiMoS/Ti, RuO2/Ti, HC-NiMoS precursor/Ti and bare Ti mesh in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. The HC-NiMoS/Ti had superior catalytic activity to the others, delivering a current density of 20 mA cm−2 with only 1.38 V, which is even higher than for commercial RuO2/Ti (1.61 V). The HER performance of the HC-NiMoS/Ti was also investigated in alkaline solution with or without urea and was found to be slightly inferior to that of commercial Pt/C but much better than for 2D-NiMoS/Ti, 2D-NiMoS/Ti, HC-NiMoS precursor/Ti and bare Ti mesh. Encouraged by the efficient activity, the HC-NiMoS/Ti//HC-NiMoS/Ti system was tested in 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M urea and required 1.59 V to deliver 10 mA cm−2 for 10 h long-time operation; for urea-free water splitting, the potential is 1.73 V. The high performance can be assigned to the hierarchical coral-like structure, the coupling effect of MoS2 and NiS2 and the incorporation of S. The special coral-like structure contains a large number of active sites that can be exposed during the electrooxidation of UOR. Furthermore, it can speed up the escape of the as-generated bubbles, preventing them from covering the electrode surface. However, the synergistic effect between MoS2 and NiS2 still needs further characterization.
3.4 Ni-Based phosphides
Nickel phosphide is another promising noble-metal-free HER catalyst and numerous studies have been conducted with high activity and strong stability in alkaline media.73–76 Phosphorus (P) incorporation dilutes the concentration of Ni, resulting in an “ensemble effect”, whereby P functions as a proton acceptor and Ni acts as a hydride acceptor. Recently, nickel phosphide-based catalysts have been used for the UOR considering the high electrochemical stability, high conductivity and the easy formation of oxygen-containing species.77,78 Ding ascribed the enhanced UOR performance on nickel phosphide to two reasons: P can regulate the electron structure of nickel, improving the anti-poisoning effect and changing the d electron density of nickel, creating more active sites.77 Based on the theoretical analysis and the established experimental results, nickel phosphide applied as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the HER and the UOR in alkaline media was subsequently launched. Liu et al. firstly demonstrated high-performance urea electrolysis towards less energy-intensive electrochemical hydrogen production using a nickel phosphide nanoflake array on carbon cloth (Ni2P NF/CC) as bifunctional catalyst electrodes.79 In their study, they synthesized Ni2P NF/CC through a low-temperature phosphidation method. The as-prepared Ni2P NF/CC electrode exhibited excellent UOR activity with a potential of 0.447 V (vs. SCE) to drive 100 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea and a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec−1, indicating the fast kinetic pathway; as for the HER performance, the Tafel slope was about 130 mV dec−1. The alkaline electrolyzer (electrolyte: 1.0 M KOH with 0.55 M urea) assembled with a Ni2P NF/CC anode and a Ni2P NF/CC cathode electrodes drives 50 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.35 V, which is 0.58 V less than for pure water splitting. From the post-HER and post-UOR Raman results, they found that NiOOH was generated during urea oxidation, which is commonly recognized as the UOR active site; however, the post-HER signals of Ni2P seemed unchanged.
To synthesize Ni2P in a more economical way, Zhang et al. successfully prepared nanocrystalline Ni2P on carbon fiber cloth (Ni2P/CFC) via a facile vapor-phase hydrothermal method (VPH) in the presence of red phosphorus.80 Firstly, Ni2+ was adsorbed on the pre-treated CFC for 24 h and then the precursor plate (Ni2+/CFC) was put into an autoclave containing NaOH solution with red phosphorus. Specifically, the location of the Ni2+/CFC was above the solution, in order to realize the VPH reaction. The autoclave was heated at 180 °C for 0.5 h in a furnace and the Ni2P/CFC was obtained after the autoclave had cooled down to room temperature. Compared with its counterpart Ni(OH)2/CFC (prepared through the same process without red phosphorus), Ni2P/CFC possesses enhanced HER and UOR performance in alkaline media. A current density of 10 mA cm−2 could be achieved at a potential 1.42 V (vs. RHE) for the UOR and an overpotential of 90 mV for HER. Based on the fact that bimetallic catalysts often display superior catalytic performance to their mono-metal counterparts. NiCoP nanosheets reported by Xie exhibited better UOR and HER activities than NiP and CoP.81 Inspired by these results, an electrolyzer with NiCoP serving as both the anode and cathode catalysts realized energy-saving H2 production, requiring 1.25 V to afford a current density of 20 mA cm−2, much lower than that of pure water splitting (1.61 V).
The bimetallic catalyst NiCoP/CC with a hierarchical structure has also recently been investigated as a high-efficiency bifunctional catalyst for UOR and HER.82 Sha synthesized NiCoP/CC by a typical two-step method: NiCo–OH on carbon cloth was firstly synthesized by hydrothermal method and then transformed to NiCoP/CC via calcination with 1.0 g of NaH2PO2·H2O powder under N2 flow. The Ni/Co ratio in the first step was adjusted to obtain NiCoP/CC with diverse Ni/Co contents (Fig. 8a). SEM and TEM images manifested that the NiCoP/CC was composed of nanowires, nanosheets and numerous tiny nanoparticles (Fig. 8b–d). The overall urea-splitting setup using NiCoP/CC as the anode and cathode for hydrogen production showed a cell voltage of 1.42 V to drive 10 mA cm−2 without recession for over 30 h. The synergistic effects of Ni and Co combined with the unique structure are responsible for the excellent urea electrolysis system (Fig. 8e–h).

Yan et al. reported an easy and time-saving method for preparing a Ni2P/Fe2P nanohybrid on NF by fast manual shaking reaction (30 s shaking) and subsequent phosphorization treatment to replace the time-consuming hydrothermal method.83 The key to fabricating the Ni2P/Fe2P nanohybrid is the formation of a Prussian blue analogue (PBA). In the fast first step, a redox reaction occurs between Ni originated from NF and Fe3+ generated from FeCl3, releasing Ni2+ and Fe2+, which further interact with K3[Fe(CN)6] to produce an insoluble PBA layer coating on NF (Fig. 9a). The color change of NF from silver to dark green confirms the successful formation of the PBA layer (Fig. 9b). The as-prepared Ni2P/Fe2P/NF exhibited efficient HER and UOR performance, as demonstrated by electrochemical tests: in 1.0 M KOH solution, the overpotential was about 115 mV to deliver 10 mA cm−2 and long-time stability for 20 h was observed; in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea, a potential of 1.36 V vs. RHE was required to meet a current density of 10 mA cm−2. On the other hand, Ni2P/Fe2P/NF showed the smallest resistance of 9.26 Ω (2.45 Ω), with 25.29 Ω (3.95 Ω) for Ni2P/NF and 41.61 Ω (11.04 Ω) for Fe2P/NF for the HER (UOR). The corresponding electrolyzer with Ni2P/Fe2P/NF as the anode and cathode conducted in 1.0 M KOH with or without urea exported a 10 mA cm−2 current density at 1.47 V and 1.57 V, respectively. The excellent HER/UOR activity of Ni2P/Fe2P/NF was attributed to the NF 3S macroporous structure (promoting electron transfer), the synergistic effect between Ni2P and Fe2P (tailoring the electronic structure of the catalysts), and the in situ formation avoiding the use of a binder.

3.5 Nickel-based nitrides
As far as we know, up to now, nickel nitrides applied as co-catalysts for HER and UOR are seldom reported. A mesoporous Ni3N nanosheet array on carbon cloth (Ni3N NA/CC) was shown to have efficient catalytic activity toward urea electrolysis in 2017 by Liu et al.84 It could drive 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of only 1.44 V, 120 mV less than that for the urea-free counterpart. A two-electrode electrolyzer constructed from Ni3N/NF(Ni3N/NF∥Ni3N/NF) showed better performance than Pt/C∥IrO2. To obtain 100 mA cm−2, 1.42 V was needed for Ni3N/NF∥Ni3N/NF vs. 1.60 V for Pt/C∥IrO2.
Ni4N/Cu3N nanotube arrays were prepared through a hydrothermal and nitridation process using copper foam as the copper source and support.85 The symmetrical electrolyzer required a low cell voltage of about 1.48 V to supply a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and excellent durability (run for 10 h at a high current density of 100 mA cm−2) and distinguished hydrogen efficiency (100% Faradaic efficiency) (Fig. 10). The XPS profiles of Cu and N show the existence of Cu+ and an M–N bond. This means that Cu binds with N to form conductive Cu3N, which could ensure the fast electron transfer for the UOR. Further analysis of the N spectrum indicates that N–H groups were formed, indicating the strong interaction between N and H, which facilitates the HER. Ni exists in valences of Ni+ and Ni2+ while Ni2+ is the dominant form. The high Ni2+ content implies the possibility of abundant Ni3+ generation during the oxidation process, which has been recognized as the real active site for urea oxidation.

3.6 Ni-Free catalysts
Strictly speaking, very few catalysts without any Ni are applied in urea electrolysis because NF is the most commonly used substrate. For example, Fe–O–P/NF, CoMoO4/Co9S8/NF, Co–P/NF, Co(OH)F/NF, MnO2/MnCo2O4/Ni, Co5.47N/rGO/NF, CuCo2O4/NF and CoP/C/NF.35,86–92 With NF as the substrate, Fu et al. synthesized Co(OH)F/NF via a facile hydrothermal method and amorphous Co–P/NF by low-temperature phosphidation strategy.88 Co(OH)F/NF serves as an excellent UOR catalyst, requiring 1.25 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH with 0.7 M urea, which is 250 mV lower than in 1.0 M KOH, rendering this catalyst as a promising substitute for the OER from water splitting. The amorphous Co–P/NF behaves well in alkaline HER: to achieve 10 mA cm−2 a low overpotential of 70 mV is needed. Energy-saving hydrogen production in a urea electrolysis system with Co–P/NF and Co(OH)F/NF as the cathode and anode, respectively, requires 1.42 V to obtain 20 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH with 0.7 M urea. The high catalytic activity is ascribed to the 3D NF porous structure and the high surface-to-volume ratio of the 1D nanorods. A novel four-level hierarchical MnO2/MnCo2O4/Ni electrode composed of NF, MnCo2O4 core-nanoflake arrays, ultra-thin MnO2 nanosheets and mesopores with different pore sizes has been developed through hydrothermal and electrodeposition for the overall urea electrolyzer.89 The UOR catalytic activity of the novel catalyst showed a low onset potential of 1.33 V vs. RHE and a super-high current density of 1000 mA cm−2 at 1.7 V RHE because of the rich valance states of Co and Mn. The fabricated urea electrolytic cell with this hybrid structure gives 10 mA cm−2 at 1.5 V.
In order to eliminate the effect of NF, inactive Ti mesh (TM), Cu foam and carbon cloth were used as supports.79–82,84,93–97 A representative work by Sun and co-workers demonstrated that a CoS2 nanoneedle array (CoS2 NA/Ti) shows excellent UOR performance in 1.0 M KOH + urea.94 CoS2 possesses metallic nature, is extremely low cost and is expected to have long-term stability in both acidic and alkaline operating environments, and has recently been identified as an efficient electrocatalyst for the HER.95–97 Integrating the satisfactory HER and UOR performance, the full urea electrolysis system consisting of CoS2 NA/Ti//CoS2NA/Ti electrodes showed 1.59 V in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea versus 1.73 V in 1.0 M KOH alone to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2. It is also lower than that of the urea electrolyzer employing Pt/C//RuO2 (1.63 V). Encouraged by the fact that Zn element plays an irreplaceable role in the human body and the theoretical prediction that the introduction of Zn into Co could reduce the location of the d-band centre of Co, Sun synthesized a Zn0.08Co0.92P/TM nanowall array.95 As expected, Zn0.08Co0.92P/TM showed better UOR performance than CoP/TM in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea demonstrating 115 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V, compared with only 57.5 mA cm−2 for CoP/TM. The Zn0.08Co0.92P/TM//Zn0.08Co0.92P/TM two-electrode urea-splitting electrolyzer demands only 1.38 V to approach 10 mA cm−2 in the presence of 0.5 M urea in 1.0 M KOH solution.
In light of the unique molecular structure of urea (amino (–NH2): electron-donating group; carbonyl (CO): electron-withdrawing group), Li put forward a brand-new perspective: constructing a metallic CoS2 and semi-metallic MoS2 Schottky heterojunction.98 Owing to the different Fermi levels of CoS2 and MoS2, self-driven electrons could flow through the interface, leading to charge re-distribution, an electrophilic region on the CoS2 surface, and the corresponding nucleophilic side of MoS2 is formed (Fig. 11a). As a result, during the urea electrooxidation process on this heterojunction, amino of urea adsorbed on CoS2 while carbonyl bonded strongly with MoS2 (Fig. 11b). Thus the cracking of the C–N bond of molecular urea is facilitated. On the other hand, CO2 desorption on the surface of the CoS2–MoS2 Schottky catalyst takes place more easily than on MoS2 and CoS2. As expected, the Schottky catalyst showed superior performance over full urea electrolysis, with only 1.29 V to drive 10 mA cm−2, and retained its capability without degradation for 60 h.

Another remarkable work was reported by Qiao.99 By tuning the zeta potential, they obtained small lateral size two-dimensional MnO2 nanosheets (S–MnO2, thickness: 0.95 nm, lateral size: 50–200 nm) from original MnO2 nanolayers with different sizes. They prepared an electrode by incorporating S–MnO2 into graphene and NF (NF-G-Mn) and the resulting catalyst exhibited outstanding performance toward the UOR, 1.33 V vs. RHE for 10 mA cm−2, lower than for larger MnO2 particles (1.37 V). Overall urea splitting in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M urea by coupling a NF-G-Mn anode and a cobalt phosphide–nickel foam cathode worked well at a cell voltage of 1.8 V for as long as 20 h.
4. Other groundbreaking work
Distinguished from conventional urea electrolytic cells using KOH solution with urea as the electrolyte, Wang et al. constructed an asymmetric-electrolyte electrolyzer with a bipolar membrane, where the UOR occurs in the alkaline anode while the HER takes place in the acidic cathode.100 This ingenious electrolyzer takes advantage of two kinds of energy together: the electrochemical neutralization energy (ENE) and the electrochemical urea oxidation energy (Fig. 12). The as-designed electrolyzer with a Ni0.67Co0.33(OH)2 nanosheet anode and its corresponding sulfide Ni0.67Co0.33S2 as the cathode can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for electrolytic H2 generation with a rather low applied voltage of 0.54 V. Remarkably, the pH difference (ΔpH) between the anode and the cathode of the alkaline–acid electrolyzer greatly influenced the catalytic performance and under the optimal ΔpH of 14.5, only 0.54 V is needed to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, saving 56.1% energy compared with overall water alkaline splitting. They also explored the catalytic behavior of CuCl/rGO in this asymmetric-electrolyte electrolyzer and determined the applied voltage for the overall urea splitting.101 The cell voltage was reduced to 0.83 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with 2.0 M KOH as the anode electrolyte and 0.5 M H2SO4 as the cathode electrolyte.

Quaternary electrocatalysts for hydrogen production by urea electrolysis were first investigated by Wu et al.102 They designed and synthesized a Mo–Co–S–Se/CC catalyst with a core–shell structure and abundant interfaces and characterized the HER, OER, and UOR performance, as well as the alkaline overall urea/water splitting performance. About 1.4 V/1.62 V was needed for the urea/water electrolyzer to attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with Mo–Co–S–Se/CC as the cathodic and anodic electrodes.
Fluorine (F) is the most electronegative of all the elements in the periodic table and has been utilized as an effective doping agent to boost electrochemical reactions by disturbing the electron charge balance to increase the number of active sites and the charge transfer rate.103–105 Hao expanded this theory to UOR catalysts and created a heterojunction structure: Ni(OH)2 nanosheets/F-doped Ni3S2.106 Another important thing to note is that this method for F doping is distinguished from the common high-temperature sintering method and can be realized under mild hydrothermal conditions (Fig. 13). Both the OER and UOR performance are greatly enhanced compared with pristine Ni3S2, Ni(OH)2 and F-doped Ni3S2. Although it has not been applied as a HER catalyst, it brings a new idea for the design and synthesis of other sophisticated catalysts with overall urea-splitting activity.

5. Conclusion and outlook
When substituting the anode OER of water splitting by the UOR, the electrolyzer can fulfill hydrogen production in an energy-saving pathway for urea electrolysis as well as sewage purification. The recent developments with electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis in alkaline media have been presented. In detail, two categories of electrocatalysts are discussed, Ni-based (including metallic Ni and alloys, Ni-based oxides/ hydroxides, chalcogenides, phosphides, nitrides, etc.) and Ni-free electrocatalysts, with their own advantages and disadvantages. A comparison of the electrocatalytic performance of these catalysts is shown in Table 2. We have also focused on breakthrough work for lowering the cell voltage.

Despite the promising potential for overall alkaline urea-splitting systems, electrocatalysts with poor catalytic performance, the lack of fundamentals in electrocatalytic mechanisms for Ni-free catalysts, the energy-consuming and tedious approaches for catalyst preparation, and the high electrical power consumption of the electrolyzers restrict their future commercial application. The main challenges and strategies are as follows:
(1) Compared with the thorough and mature investigation of the HER, the rational design of cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts for UOR is relatively defective and insufficient, although some momentous advances have been made. UOR catalysts are the key to realizing energy-saving hydrogen generation from urea splitting. Therefore, challenges in the design of high-performance UOR catalysts should be emphasized: 1) design versatile structures and morphologies to enhance the utilization efficiency of active sites. UOR catalysts are frequently fabricated in situ on NF, which greatly affects the physical properties and the distribution of catalysts, thus the exposure of active sites and the surface area are severely affected. Special structures, such as 1D ultra-fine nanowires, 2D ultra-thin nanosheets, core–shell nanohybrids, hollow nanospheres, nanoclusters, nanodots and single-atom catalysts or their assembled models with efficient catalytic characteristics are highly desirable. Besides, DFT calculation is indispensable for guiding the structural design. 2) Catalysts towards the UOR are subject to multi-functionality with low overpotential (fast intrinsic kinetics), high electrocatalytic activity (superior sensitivity and selectivity) and long-term stability (excellent anti-poisoning ability). Usually, the addition of a metal element improves the UOR catalytic performance from the point of either decreasing the overpotential or enhancing the activity or avoiding the poisoning from CO intermediates, but it is difficult to achieve these goals simultaneously. So, future Ni-based multi-metal catalysts are expected to achieve multi-functionality. 3) The UOR mechanism on Ni species is largely clear but very ambiguous in-depth for other non-Ni catalysts. Therefore, in-depth investigation with advanced techniques at the atom/molecular level, such as in situ XRD, RS, IR, XPS, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), is of great importance to clarify the electrocatalytic mechanism.
(2) Approaches for fabricating electrocatalysts are still limited, especially for Ni-based catalysts. Ni-Based oxides/hydroxides are often prepared by long hydro-/solvo-thermal processes followed by high-temperature treatment methods, while Ni-based chalcogenides/phosphides/nitrides are mainly obtained from thermal annealing under N2/Ar/NH3 accompanied by heavy energy consumption. In view of this, developing facile, energy-saving and simple means of optimizing electrocatalysts with excellent performance is highly desirable.
(3) Despite the promising potentials for hydrogen from the overall alkaline urea-splitting systems, integrating a urea electrolyzer with photocatalysts is also very important for convenient facilities. Wang has demonstrated the possibility of this method,107 but there is a lot of room for further improvement in this respect. Apart from the hot topic of urea (urine) electrolysis generating hydrogen gas, at present, the photoelectrochemical UOR splitting technique is also popular for dealing with urine to produce hydrogen. Since sunlight is free of charge and unlimited, and urine is generated by humans and animals every day, this project is very attractive and energy-saving. A representative work by Wang demonstrated that under solar (chopped AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2)), urine can be oxidized in a photoelectrochemical cell when Ni(OH)2–TiO2 or Ni(OH)2-α-Fe2O3 are used as the photoanode while hydrogen is released at the Pt photocathode.107 In addition, a Ni(OH)2/Au@Co–Fe2O3 photoanode exhibited a stable photocurrent of 0.68 mA cm−2 without bias and hydrogen evolved from the counter Pt photocathode at 0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl.108
In conclusion, with the development of sophisticated nanotechnology and advanced characterization methods for electrocatalysts, energy-saving hydrogen production via urea electrolysis will bring remarkable progress in the future.
