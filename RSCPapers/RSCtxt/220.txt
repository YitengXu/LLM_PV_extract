However, the development of flexible OSCs lags behind the cells fabricated on rigid glass.

With PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F as the nonfullerene active layer, the fabricated flexible solar cell displays a power conversion efficiency of 11.6% (VOC = 0.82 V, JSC = 19.6 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.72).
1. Introduction
Compared with their inorganic counterparts, light weight and excellent mechanical flexibility are the most important advantages of organic solar cells.1–6 In the past few years, research of organic solar cells has progressed very rapidly.7–9 Particularly, the development of nonfullerene acceptors has pushed the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to over 14% for single-junction cells and 17% for tandem cells.10–16 These high efficiencies are achieved on rigid glass substrates with indium tin oxide (ITO) as the bottom electrode. To date, the PCE of flexible organic solar cells reaches about 10%,17–19 which is lower than those of the cells on rigid glass substrates. The high-performance nonfullerene active layers have rarely been applied to demonstrate flexible solar cells.17,19
The flexible substrate and transparent bottom electrode play key roles to achieve high-performance organic solar cells. In general, the following characteristics are required for a high-performance transparent bottom electrode:20–22 (1) high optical transmittance is required to allow photons to reach the active layer and get absorbed; (2) low sheet resistance is required to reduce the series resistance of solar cells; (3) low surface roughness is required to avoid the leakage or electrical shortage; (4) surface work function is important for efficient charge collection; (5) good mechanical flexibility is required to retain the efficiency during bending; (6) high temperature tolerance (typically over 150 °C) for the annealing processing. So far, indium tin oxide (ITO),23,24 conducting polymers,25–29 ultrathin metals and metal oxides,30–33 silver nanowires (AgNWs)34–37 and carbon-based materials38–42 have been used as the flexible transparent bottom electrode to fabricate flexible organic solar cells. But few of these electrodes can simultaneously fulfill all these requirements. For example, indium tin oxide (ITO) has high transmittance and conductivity, but has poor mechanical flexibility.43–46 Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has good mechanical flexibility, but it has limited conductivity (about 1000 S cm−1) and transmittance in the long-wavelength region (>700 nm) (Fig. S1†).47,48 AgNW electrodes have good mechanical flexibility and conductivity and can be solution-processable, but they have a very rough surface that could result in large leakage current or even electrical shortage.49 To reduce the surface roughness, PEDOT:PSS has been used to flat the surface of AgNW electrodes.35 Another method to flat the surfaces is to embed the AgNWs into polymer substrates, such as polyimide (PI),50,51 polymethacrylate,52 and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS).53,54
The AgNWs embedded in PI (denoted as AgNWs@PI) have been applied as the substrate and simultaneously the bottom electrode (denoted as substrate/bottom electrode) in flexible organic solar cells with fullerene-containing active layers.51,55 The PCE of the reported cells is lower than 7.5%.55 Nonfullerene active layers have not been applied on the AgNWs@PI substrate/bottom electrode. The interface for the nonfullerene active layer is sometimes different from the fullerene contained because of the different chemical structure/properties of the active layers. For example, the polyethylenimine (PEI) works very efficiently in fullerene solar cells but not in nonfullerene solar cells due to the chemical interaction between the PEI and the nonfullerene acceptor.56 The design of the interfacial layer is important to realize efficient flexible OSCs on the AgNWs@PI substrate/bottom electrodes.
In this work, we fabricated efficient flexible nonfullerene OSCs on AgNWs@PI with a novel device structure (in an inverted structure): AgNWs@PI/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 1a). ZnO is optimized and processed from isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solutions (instead of the typically used 2-methoxyethanol, 2-ME) that physically don't destroy/dissolve the PI substrates and is also chemically compatible with the nonfullerene active layer.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Optical and electronic properties and morphology of AgNWs@PI
The nonfullerene active layer is comprised of PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F, where PBDB-T-2F is the electron donor and IT-4F is the electron acceptor. The chemical structure is shown in Fig. 1b. Fig. 1c shows the fabrication procedure of the flexible AgNWs@PI electrode. Briefly, AgNWs were first coated on the glass substrate by spin coating and patterned via laser ablation. Then, PI solution was coated onto the patterned AgNW film via doctor blading. After annealing, the flexible transparent electrode AgNWs@PI was peeled off from the glass. The sheet resistance of AgNWs@PI is 24.4 ± 1.7 Ω sq−1.
Surface roughness is the most important property for AgNWs@PI electrodes to apply as the bottom electrodes for flexible organic solar cells. Generally, the optimized thickness of the organic active layer is 100–300 nm, which is limited by the short diffusion length of excitons.57 The height variation of common AgNWs spin-coated on the PI film can reach over 300 nm (Fig. S2†), which would result in the contact of the top electrode and bottom AgNW electrode and yield a large leakage current in the device. Here, the AgNWs embedded into the PI substrates (AgNWs@PI) are expected to have small surface roughness. Fig. 2a and b show the height image and the surface potential image measured by using an atomic force microscope (AFM). In the height image, AgNWs are sparse and barely interconnected. The root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of AgNWs@PI is 1.5 ± 0.5 nm. From the surface potential image, AgNWs can be observed to be well interconnected. To test the thermal stability of AgNWs@PI, the sheet resistance change of AgNWs@PI is measured with an annealing temperature of 150 °C (Fig. S3†). After 4 h annealing in air, the sheet resistance of Ag NWs@PI increases 1.1 times of the initial value. To test the binding force between the AgNWs and PI substrates, we put Kapton tape and stick onto the surface of AgNWs@PI and then peeled off the tape. After repeating the sticking–peeling cycles 10 times, the average sheet resistance of AgNWs@PI was 26.0 Ω sq−1 after the testing, which is similar to its original value (25.8 Ω sq−1). The strategy of embedding AgNWs into the PI substrates contributes to the strong binding force between AgNWs and PI substrates.

Fig. 2c shows the transmittance of the AgNWs@PI electrode from 300 to 900 nm. As a reference, the transmittance of ITO on glass (denoted as glass/ITO) is also measured. The transmittance of AgNWs@PI is slightly lower than that of the glass/ITO sample before 720 nm but larger than that of the glass/ITO sample at the wavelength longer than 720 nm. In the main absorption region of active layers between 460 to 780 nm, the average transmittance of AgNWs@PI and glass/ITO is 83.2% and 85.7%, respectively. The reflectance spectra of the AgNWs@PI and the glass/ITO samples are shown in Fig. 2d. Slightly higher reflectance is observed for the AgNWs@PI electrode in the spectral region over 530 nm. The transmittance and reflectance spectra of the pure PI film are shown in Fig. S4.† Overall, the transmittance of AgNWs@PI is comparable to that of glass/ITO in the absorption spectral region of the PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F active layer.
2.2. Optimization of processing solvents of the ZnO electron transporting layer
The surface work function of AgNWs@PI is about 4.9 eV measured by using a Kelvin probe. A low work function interface is required to produce efficient electron collection. Though polyethylenimine (PEI) can efficiently reduce the work function of the electrode with low-temperature processing, the chemical interaction between the PEI and the ITIC is detrimental to the device performance.56 Here, ZnO is used as the electron transporting layer (ETL). The optimization of the processing for ZnO is important. When the ZnO precursor solution is processed from widely used 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME), we find that the 2-ME could dissolve and destroy the PI film and AgNWs@PI, resulting in very poor device performance (Fig. S5†). To avoid the issue of dissolving the PI substrates, we have tried different solvents to process ZnO. Other polar solvents, including N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), can also dissolve the PI substrates. These solvents have large dipole moments: 2.04 for 2-ME, 3.86 for DMF, 4.09 for NMP, and 4.1 for DMSO. Then, we switched to a solvent with low dipole moments. Isopropanol (IPA) with a dipole moment of 1.66 is found safe to the PI substrates. The work function of ZnO sol–gel in IPA and 2-ME is 4.46 eV and 4.40 eV, respectively. The electrical conductivity of ZnO processed from IPA is 1.58 × 10−7 S cm−1, which is similar to that of the ZnO processed from 2 ME (2.09 × 10−7 S cm−1). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and photovoltaic parameters of OSCs with ZnO processed from IPA and 2-ME are shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1.† The OSC based on ZnO processed from 2-ME presents a PCE of 12.84% with VOC = 0.82 V, JSC = 20.78 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.75. The OSC based on ZnO processed from IPA shows the following performance: VOC = 0.82 V, JSC = 20.26 mA cm−2, FF = 0.74, and PCE = 12.29%. The slightly lower current density of ZnO processed from IPA might be caused by the lower transmittance in the spectral region less than 400 nm (Fig. S7†). Therefore, ZnO processed from IPA can also yield a high photovoltaic performance. Importantly, the processing of ZnO from IPA is compatible with the AgNWs@PI substrates and electrode.
2.3. Performance of flexible nonfullerene organic solar cells

Fig. 3a presents the J–V curves of the inverted flexible solar cells (AgNWs@PI/ZnO/PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F/MoO3/Ag) and the reference cells (glass/ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F/MoO3/Ag). The ZnO layers are processed from IPA. The photovoltaic parameters of the cells are summarized in Table 1. The device with AgNWs@PI shows a PCE of 11.6% with VOC = 0.82 V, JSC = 19.61 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.72 under illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. The PCE is slightly lower than that of the glass/ITO reference sample (12.3%, with VOC = 0.82 V, JSC = 20.50 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.73). In the AFM height images (Fig. S8†), the active layer coated on AgNWs@PI shows a similar morphology to that deposited on the rigid substrate. The RMS roughness of the active layer on AgNWs@PI is 2.01 nm. The slightly inferior PCE of flexible cells with AgNWs@PI electrodes is mainly due to their lower JSC than that of glass/ITO based cells (19.61 and 20.50 mA cm−2). The difference of JSC is further analyzed via the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 3b). From the EQE spectra, the integral current densities calculated from the curves are 19.21 and 18.28 mA cm−2 for glass/ITO and AgNWs@PI based OSCs, which are consistent with the results from the J–V curves. The EQE spectrum of the glass/ITO-based reference device has a higher value in the wavelength range from 350 to 650 nm compared with the AgNWs@PI-based flexible device. We further conduct the reflectance loss measurements of solar cells with glass/ITO and AgNWs@PI. As shown in Fig. 3c, in the wavelength ranges from 350 to 650 nm, the two cells show a very similar reflectance loss. Since the top electrode Ag is opaque without light transmission, the similar reflectance loss means similar light harvesting in the whole devices including the substrates and the active layers.58 The slightly lower JSC of the flexible cells with the AgNWs@PI electrode is due to the absorption of the pure PI film in this region below 600 nm (Fig. S4c†). Reducing the absorption of the PI substrates via breaking the conjugation of the PI chain will be the next step to further increase the solar cell efficiency.

Fig. 4a shows the histograms of statistical PCEs of 30 flexible solar cells based on AgNWs@PI electrodes. The average PCE is 10.8%. There is no device showing electrical shortage. For cells fabricated based on PI/AgNWs (the inset of Fig. 4a), the obtained typical J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S9 and Table S2,† and they display a much lower yield (40%) and PCEs (the maximum is 7.4%). The active layer deposited on PI/AgNWs exhibits a rough surface (Fig. S10†) with a roughness of 6.4 nm. AgNWs penetrate through the active layer that would cause the direct contact with the top electrode and lead to the electrical shortage of the cells. 18 out of the 30 devices exhibit electrical shortage.
 Fig. 4  (a) PCE histogram of devices based on AgNWs@PI and on PI/AgNW (the inset) electrodes. AgNWs@PI denotes AgNWs embedded in the PI substrates. PI/AgNWs denotes AgNWs coated on top of the PI substrates; (b) normalized VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of the flexible OSCs after different bending cycles at a bending radius of 5 mm. 
A bending test is performed to demonstrate the mechanical flexibility of flexible OSCs with AgNWs@PI (Fig. 4b). After 5000 consecutive bending cycles with a radius of 5 mm, the degradation of VOC is negligible (nearly 3%), and JSC and FF can still retain 95% and 94% of the initial values. Then the PCE drops to about 88% of the initial value after 5000 consecutive bending cycles. Fig. S11† shows the recently reported high PCE values in the literature. The PCE we achieve here of 11.6% is one of the highest values among the literature for flexible organic solar cells (Fig. S11 and Table S3†).
To demonstrate the compatibility of the AgNWs@PI flexible electrodes with other nonfullerene materials, we also fabricate flexible solar cells with PBDB-T:ITIC and PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F as the active layers. Their chemical structures are shown in Fig. S12.† Their J–V characteristics and photovoltaic parameters are provided in Fig. S13† and Table 1, respectively. The flexible device with PBDB-T:ITIC shows a PCE up to 9.3% with a VOC of 0.88 V, a JSC of 15.7 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.72. Another flexible device with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F shows a PCE up to 10.3% with a VOC of 0.68 V, a JSC of 22.69 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.67. And the average PCEs of these two active layers are 8.8% and 9.9%, respectively. This high performance suggests AgNWs@PI is a good choice to fabricate flexible nonfullerene organic solar cells with higher performance and device yield.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated flexible nonfullerene organic solar cells (AgNWs@PI/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag) with a power conversion efficiency up to 11.6%. The demonstration of the efficient nonfullerene organic solar cells is enabled by the use of AgNWs embedded in polyimide (PI) substrates and the optimization of the electron transporting layer (ZnO). The ZnO processed from isopropanol precursor solution can be physically compatible with the PI substrate, and chemically compatible with the active layer. The combination of AgNWs@PI/ZnO has been shown applicable to different nonfullerene active layers (PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F, PBDB-T:ITIC and PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F). The PI substrates can tolerate temperature over 300 °C. This would allow the optimization of the active layer and interfacial layer to further enhance the solar cell performance, and also show promise for other electronic device applications.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials
PBDB-T-2F, IT-4F, PBDB-T, ITIC, PTB7-Th, and IEICO-4F were purchased from Organtecsolar Materials Inc., Beijing. Polyimide (PI) was provided by Wuhan Imide New Materials Technology Co., LTD. The PI solution was prepared by dissolving 5.0 g PI with consecutive magnetic stirring in 32 ml N, N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAC, ≥ 99.0%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd). Based on the reported literature,21 AgNW solution in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (1.7 mg ml−1) was synthesized. The ZnO sol–gel solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1 g zinc acetate dihydrate and 0.028 g ethanolamine (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 ml isopropanol (IPA) or 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME). Silver slug (99.999%) and molybdenum oxide (99.9%) for evaporation were received from Alfa Aesar.
4.2 Preparation of AgNWs@PI
A glass substrate was cleaned by an ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and IPA. The AgNW solution was spin-coated on clean glass substrates and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. The AgNW films were patterned via laser ablation. Then, PI solution was bladed on the patterned AgNWs and a step-like annealing procedure was performed from 30 to 180 °C with an increase of 30 °C for each step. Each annealing temperature is held for 30 min.59 Finally, the flexible PI substrates with AgNWs embedded (AgNWs@PI) were peeled from the glass substrate. A pure PI film was fabricated by the same step without embedded AgNWs.
4.3 Fabrication of flexible solar cells
Prior to the deposition of the ZnO ETL, the AgNWs@PI electrodes were treated with plasma for 3 min to improve the surface wettability. ZnO sol–gel solution was spin-coated on the electrodes at 3500 rpm for 1 min and then annealed at 200 °C for 30 min to form the ETL. And the solution with PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F (10 mg ml−1: 10 mg ml−1) in chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich) with 0.5 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, Sigma-Aldrich) was spin-coated on the surfaces of the ETL at 1500 rpm for 60 s, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min in a nitrogen-filled glove box. Finally, the molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and silver slug (Ag) were thermally evaporated on the active layer under a mask sequentially in a thermal evaporator (Mini-Spectros, Kurt J. Lesker). The organic solar cells with PBDB-T:ITIC and PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F active layers were fabricated in a similar way. OSC devices based on three bottom electrodes, AgNWs@PI, PI with AgNWs spun on, and glass/ITO, were fabricated, respectively.
4.4 Characterization
The sheet resistances and work functions of the samples were measured using a 4-Point Probes Measurement System and Kelvin Probe (KP020, KP Technology), respectively. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured inside a N2-filled glove box using a source meter (2400, Keithley Instruments) controlled with a LabVIEW program under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) and a Newport solar simulator. Atomic force morphology of the films was performed in tapping mode on a Shimadzu SPM9700 in air. The transmittance, reflectance, and absorption spectra of the films were measured using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). The external quantum efficiency was measured using a 150 W xenon lamp (Oriel) equipped with a monochromator (Cornerstone 74004) as a monochromatic light source.
