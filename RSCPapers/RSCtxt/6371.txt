    , Accepted 14th April 2016First published on 14th April 2016AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) quasi-ordered nitrogen-enriched porous carbon (QNPC) nanohybrids, with the characteristics of an ultrathin graphite nanosheet framework and thick quasi-ordered nitrogen-doped carbon cladding with a porous texture, have been synthesized via an in situ polymerization assembly method. In the synthesis, the expandable graphite (EG) is enlarged by an intermittent microwave method, and then aniline monomers are intercalated into the interlayers of the expanded EG with the assistance of a vacuum. Subsequently, the intercalated aniline monomers could assemble on the interlayer surface of the expanded EG, accompanied by the in situ polymerization from aniline monomers to polyaniline. Meanwhile, the expanded EG could be exfoliated to graphite nanosheets. By subsequent pyrolysis and activation processes, the QNPC nanohybrids could be prepared. As supercapacitor electrodes, a typical QNPC12-700 sample derived from the precursor containing an EG content of 12%, with a high level of nitrogen doping of 5.22 at%, offers a high specific capacitance of 305.7 F g−1 (1 A g−1), excellent rate-capability and long-term stability. Notably, an extremely high energy density of 95.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 449.7 W kg−1 in an ionic liquid electrolyte can be achieved. The unique structural features and moderate heteroatom doping of the QNPC nanohybrids combines electrochemical double layer and faradaic capacitance contributions, which make these nanohybrids ideal candidates as electrode materials for high-performance energy storage devices.
1. Introduction
The development of energy storage and conversion devices is highly desirable due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy resources, such as solar, hydraulic and wind energy. Supercapacitors, possessing high power and energy density, as well as a long cycle life, have attracted remarkable attention.1 Because electrode materials determine the energy storage performance and applications of supercapacitors, considerable research has been devoted to exploiting novel high-performance electrode materials.2 Conventionally, carbon materials are mainly adopted in commercially available supercapacitors because of their stable physicochemical properties, environmental friendliness, good processability and low-cost.3–5 Until now, various structures of carbon materials have been investigated as electrodes, including one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers,6,7 two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet structures,8,9 and three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon,10–12 carbon spheres,13,14 carbon foam,15 and carbon aerogels.16 Among these, the 2D planar structure could shorten the diffusion distance of electrolyte ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface and could also speed up electron transport, so higher power and energy densities of supercapacitors can be achieved.17 Recently, 2D graphene materials have been widely applied in energy storage devices owing to their unique electrical, mechanical, chemical properties and high specific surface areas.18 However, the graphene is usually derived from graphite oxide, which is prepared by rigorous manipulation in strongly acidic conditions. Moreover, the strong π–π interaction between graphene interlayers leads to inevitable aggregation and restacking, which could greatly reduce the effective surface and limit the full development of specific capacitance.19 Alternatively, chemical modification has been considered as an effective strategy for preventing the aggregation of graphene nanosheets. Generally, other carbon materials,20,21 metal oxides,22 metal sulfide,23 or conducting polymers could be introduced onto the surface of graphene nanosheets.24,25 Nevertheless, this strategy often results in problems of a low voltage window and fewer available options for electrolytes, accompanied by a high cost, which would greatly constrain its large-scale application in energy storage.
To enhance the specific capacitance of carbon materials, considerable efforts have been contributed towards the development of functional carbon-based materials with plentiful porosity by providing continuous electrons and ions transport pathways during the charge/discharge process.26 Moreover, heteroatom doping in a carbon matrix has been regarded as another attractive route to improve the energy storage capacity of carbon materials, which can not only enhance materials surface activity, but can also improve the wettability of electrodes with electrolyte and increase the total capacitance by providing a redox pseudo-capacitance effect.27–29 At present, 2D graphene-like porous materials with a high specific surface area and high-level heteroatom doping can be prepared by coating various polymers, such as polyaniline (PANI),24,30–32 polypyrrole,5,33 poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene),34,35etc. Regretfully, this usually suffers from electrolyte restrictions, poor rate-capability and poor stability.31,33 Alternatively, 2D hybrids formed by carbonization of the precursor of polymer coating onto the surface of graphene would exhibit higher specific capacitance because of faradaic electron-transfer processes. Simultaneously, the 2D hybrids can preserve the heteroatoms derived from polymers that could be incorporated into bulk carbon materials homogeneously and maintain the unique morphologies during the carbonization treatment.36,37 In our previous study, we successfully designed 2D mesoporous carbon/graphite nanosheet composites as supercapacitor electrodes by vacuum-assisted intercalation of a phenolic resin precursor into the interlayers of expandable graphite (EG), and subsequent in situ polymerization, exfoliation and carbonization processes.38 This strategy is simple and easy to be scaled-up, in combination with the advantage of being low cost by adopting cheap EG as a resource. In this consideration, we want to develop an effective method to synthesize similar 2D porous structure carbon-based materials with heteroatom-doping derived from EG and polymer.
Herein, 2D planar porous structure nitrogen-enriched graphite nanosheet (QNPC) nanohybrids have been synthesized by a facile in situ polymerization assembly strategy from low-cost EG and aniline monomer. Firstly, the homogeneous aniline monomer dissolved into ethanol solvent was intercalated into the interlayers of EG by a vacuum-assisted process. Then, aniline (Ani) monomers that existed in the interlayer of EG could assemble on the surface and in situ polymerization could occur; meanwhile, the EG could be exfoliated to graphite nanosheets to form a aniline (PANI)/graphite nanosheets nanohybrid. Finally, the QNPC nanohybrids could be obtained by subsequent pyrolysis and KOH activation processes.
As shown in Scheme 1, the special structure provides the QNPC nanohybrids the following advantages in energy storage: (i) the good conductivity of ultrathin graphite nanosheets could facilitate the rapid transport of electrons during the charge/discharge processes; (ii) the open-type hierarchical porous nanosheet structure could facilitate the transport of electrolyte ions on the whole surface of the material for the formation of electrochemical double layers; (iii) the doped nitrogen from the PANI precursor could give rise to greater surface electro-activity of materials, and enhance the capacitance by providing pseudo-capacitance. The synthesized QNPC nanohybrids can be used as a high-performance supercapacitor electrode material with high specific capacitance and energy density, excellent rate performance and good cycling stability. The present simple preparation process of QNPC nanohybrids from the low-cost raw material of EG makes the QNPC nanohybrids extremely promising for application as electrode materials in energy storage.

2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
All chemical reagents used were of analytical grade. All chemicals including aniline (Ani) monomer, ethanol, hydrochloric acid (HCl), ammonium persulfate (APS), and potassium hydroxide (KOH), were purchased from Energy Chemical. The Ani was distilled under vacuum to remove the oxidation impurities. Expandable graphite (45 μm) was purchased from Qingdao Tianyuan Company. Expanded EG was obtained by heating EG using an intermittent microwave method.
2.2 Preparation of QNPC nanohybrids
In a typical synthesis, Ani monomer was added to 20 ml ethanol and ultrasonicated for 20 min. Subsequently, the Ani ethanol solution was added into the graphite interlayers of EG by a vacuum-assisted intercalation method. The mixed solution was transferred to a round-bottom flask, and then 20 mL of 1 M HCl aqueous solution was introduced into the above solution. The mixed solution was cooled to 0–5 °C and stirred for 30 min. APS (nAni:nAPS = 1:1) in 20 mL 1 M HCl aqueous solution was slowly added into the flask by a constant pressure drop funnel with stirring under a N2 atmosphere. The polymerization was allowed to proceed for 24 h at 0–5 °C under a N2 atmosphere. Finally, the reaction product was collected by centrifugation and washed successively with deionized water and ethanol until the filtrate was colourless, and then dried at 60 °C for 24 h under vacuum to obtain a dark green powder. The PANI/EG nanohybrids derived from precursors with EG contents of 10%, 12% and 14% were named as PANI/EG10, PANI/EG12 and PANI/EG14, respectively. For comparison, nitrogen-doped porous carbon (denoted as NC-700) derived from PANI was prepared under the same conditions.
After polymerization, the PANI/EG nanohybrids were carbonized with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 to 500 °C for 4 h under a N2 atmosphere. QNPC nanohybrids were synthesized by the chemical activation of carbonized PANI/EG nanohybrids with KOH. Briefly, 1.0 g carbonized PANI/EG nanohybrids were dispersed in 10 mL of 10 M KOH solution and stirred at 80 °C for 8 h. Thereafter, the mixtures were treated at 600, 700, and 800 °C for 2 h under a N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to obtain QNPC nanohybrids. The nanohybrids were washed with dilute 1 M HCl aqueous solution and deionized water until the filtrate became neutral. The samples were finally dried overnight at 80 °C in an oven. For convenience, the final products were denoted as QNPC10-700, QNPC12-600, QNPC12-700, QNPC12-800 and QNPC14-700, respectively. The same procedure was adopted for EG and PANI (labeled EG-700 and NC-700, respectively) at the carbonization temperature of 700 °C for comparison.
2.3 Materials characterization
Morphology and structural analyses were carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI S-4800) with an acceleration voltage of 5 kV and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2100) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Atomic force microscope (AFM) images were recorded on a 5100 ALP (prototype Agilent Technologies) in the tapping mode (dynamic force mode). Commercially available Si cantilevers with a force constant of 20 N m−1 were used as the substrate. The crystal phase of the samples was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX-III-B-40KV, Japan, Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å). Raman measurements were carried out using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (OMNIC Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The surface of the samples was examined by X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) that was performed with a VGESCALAB MK II using Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) achromatic X-ray radiation. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the products was measured by N2 adsorption–desorption (TriStar II 3020). Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a TA-SDTQ600 Instrument, with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in N2. The sample was dried for 10 h at 150 °C under vacuum before measurement. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR Perkin Elmer Spectrometer) was carried out using a Bruker Vector 22 and KBr pellets.
2.4 Preparation of electrodes and electrochemical measurements
The electrodes were prepared by a solvent evaporation method. The prepared QNPC nanohybrids and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were mixed in a weight ratio of 90:10, and dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. The electrodes with foam nickel and aluminum foil substrates were prepared respectively. Half-cell electrode tests were performed with three-electrode cells. A platinum electrode (1 × 1 cm2) acted as the counter electrode, a standard calomel reference electrode (SCE) with saturated KCl solution was the reference electrode, and 6 M KOH solution served as the electrolyte. A two-electrode symmetrical cell was assembled with a 2025-type coin cell with 6 M KOH and 1 M NEt4BF4-PC electrolyte. The total active material mass for all the tests was about 5 mg. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) experiments were performed on a CHI660D electrochemical working station. The constant current charge–discharge curves were measured by a LAND battery tester. The specific capacitance, power and energy density were calculated based on the total mass of anode and cathode materials.
In the case of the three-electrode cells, the specific capacitances were calculated according to the equation: (1)where I (A) is the constant discharge current, Δt (s) is the discharge time, ΔV is the voltage drop upon discharging (excluding the IR drop), and m is the active substance mass of the electrode material.
In the case of the two-electrode cells, the specific capacitances (Ccell), energy densities (E) and power densities (P) could be calculated from the galvanostatic discharge test by applying the following equation: (2) (3) (4)where I is the discharge current, Δt is the discharge time, ΔV is the voltage drop upon discharging, and m is the substance mass of two electrodes.
The Coulombic efficiency (η) was calculated by using the equation: (5)where tc and td represent the times for charge and discharge, respectively.
3 Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characterizations
The morphologies and structures of the as-prepared 2D quasi-ordered nitrogen-enriched porous carbon QNPC12-700 nanohybrid with a mass content of 12% EG prepared at 700 °C were investigated by SEM and TEM. The expanded EG displays a hierarchical structure with diamond-shaped pores, as the SEM images show in Fig. S1a and S1b.† The TEM and AFM images imply a planar structure of EG consisting of about 10 layers of graphene (Fig. S2a–S2d†). After a series of intercalation, polymerization and exfoliation processes, the PANI/EG12 nanohybrid exhibits a rough and thin nanosheet structure (Fig. S1c and S1d†). As can be seen from Fig. 1a, the QNPC12-700 nanohybrid exhibits a 2D planar nanosheet microstructure covered with a quasi-ordered tower-like carbon layer. The TEM image further indicates that the synthesized QNPC12-700 nanohybrid is composed of thin and uniform nanosheets with a rough surface (Fig. 1b and c). The thin dark lines in the interior zone could be attributed to the edge of the graphite nanosheets, which as a self-supported skeleton with excellent electrical conductivity is beneficial to electron transport in the electrodes to achieve high-rate performance and good stability. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. 1d and e reveal that the surface of the QNPC12-700 sample is fully covered with a uniform porous carbon layer, which is composed of open-type macropores from the crevices of tower-like carbon, and mesopores with pore sizes of 2–10 nm (blue arrows in Fig. 1d). The open-type hierarchical porous nanosheet structure could facilitate the electrolyte ions transport over the surface of the whole material for the formation of electrical double-layer capacitance.10,37,39–41 The visual structural scheme is illustrated in Fig. 1f. AFM characterization provided more information about the surface structure and thickness of the QNPC12-700 nanohybrid. Fig. S2e and S2f† show the tower-like porous carbon layer coatings on the graphite nanosheet surface with a thickness of about 30 nm. For comparison, NC-700, derived from pure Ani and prepared by the same procedure as QNPC12-700 but without the EG skeleton, was also prepared. It could be observed that both the PANI precursor and NC-700 sample show aggregated and rambling geometrical structures (Fig. S3†). XRD patterns were measured to investigate the crystalline structures of the samples. As the wide-angle XRD patterns show in Fig. 2a and S4a,† both the broad diffraction peak centered at 2θ = 23.5° and the weak diffraction peak at 2θ = 43.7° in the NC-700 sample can be attributed to the characterization of amorphous carbon nanostructures.42 Because the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 23.5° are very weak, only the strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.6°, indexed as the (002) plane of well-ordered graphite, could be observed in the QNPC12-700 nanohybrid, which is consistent with the EG-700 derived from directly annealing the expanded EG. Furthermore, a strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 1.36° (d = 3.2 nm) can be clearly observed in the small-angle XRD patterns of samples, which suggests that the QNPC12-700 nanohybrid possesses a mesoporous structure (Fig. 2b and S4b†).38 Both the pyrolysis of PANI and the reaction between KOH and C could generate gas, resulting in the formation of plentiful mesopores.43 This rough and porous structure indicates a higher internal surface area, which can significantly offer rapid transport channels for electrolyte ions. In addition, the inner layer graphite nanosheets could facilitate electron transfer during the charge/discharge processes. Hence, the QNPC12-700 will provide a high specific capacitance and excellent electrochemical characteristics when it serves as an electrode material.

The QNPC nanohybrids obtained at different carbonization temperatures, QNPC12-600 (600 °C) and QNPC12-800 (800 °C), were also studied for comparison. As evidenced by the SEM images in Fig. S5a and S5b,† the tower-like shape could still be maintained for the QNPC12-600 and QNPC12-800 nanohybrids, but slight shrinkage would occur and the height of the rough porous carbon layer derived from the PANI layer is dwarfed with the increase in the carbonized temperature, as confirmed by TEM observations in Fig. S5c and S5d.† The XRD patterns in Fig. S4a† indicate that the crystallinity of the graphitic material is improved with the increase in carbonized temperature. Moreover, nanohybrids with different contents of EG carbonized at 700 °C, QNPC10-700 (10 wt%) and QNPC14-700 (14 wt%), were also synthesized. With the increase in EG content, the (002) peak became narrower and was obviously enhanced, which was assigned to the presence of the EG nanosheets. In addition, the small-angle XRD patterns also proved the mesoporous structure of the synthesized nanohybrids (Fig. 2b and S4†). The unique transparent 2D lamellar structure with an appropriate tower-like surface is conducive for the fast access of electrons and ions in the supercapacitor devices.
Raman spectroscopy was used to analyze the forms and degree of crystallinity of the carbon nanostructures in the QNPC nanohybrids. As shown in Fig. 3 and S6,† all the QNPC nanohybrids present a broad D-band at about 1368 cm−1, a G-band at about 1580 cm−1 and a 2D-band at about 2740 cm−1.38 The Raman characteristics of the QNPC nanohybrids are very similar to that of EG-700, indicating that the nanostructures would keep the same degree of crystallinity as that of EG. The D-band can be assigned to defects in the unordered structures, whereas the G-band corresponds to the ordered graphitic structure. The relative intensity ratio between the G-band and D-band represents the graphitization degree of the carbon materials,44 and the calculated IG/ID values of the samples are displayed in Fig. 3. The EG-700 (IG/ID = 12.88) sample exhibits a perfect graphite structure. However, the NC-700 (IG/ID = 1.28) sample has a less graphitic structure, which is caused by the composition of amorphous carbon. Compared with EG-700, the QNPC nanohybrids show a higher degree of defects or disorder, which is attributed to the amorphous carbon layer from the PANI. The graphitization degree is improved with both the increase in EG content and the increase in carbonization temperature. The Raman spectroscopy results are identical with the results of the XRD measurements.

XPS technique was used to identify the surface elemental compositions and the chemical state of the materials. Compared with EG-700, a new peak at about 400.0 eV for QNPC12-700 in the XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 4a) could be assigned to N 1s, indicating the existence of nitrogen atoms in the QNPC nanohybrids. Fig. 4b shows the high-resolution N 1s spectrum for QNPC12-700. This was divided into three component peaks, namely quaternary nitrogen (N-Q, 401.0 eV), pyrrolic (N-5, 400.2 eV) and pyridinic (N-6, 398.5 eV), respectively.42 These results indicate that most of the nitrogen was embedded in the graphitic structure in the form of N-Q, N-5 and N-6 in the graphitic layer. The N-6 and N-5 are considered to produce the pseudo-capacitance effect, while the N-Q, with a positive charge, can actively affect the electron transfer through the carbon materials.27,29,45 As shown in Fig. 4c, the C 1s spectrum of EG-700 shows an intense peak at around 284.6 eV and a broad shoulder peak, which is assigned to CC and C–C, C–O, CO, respectively. However, the C 1s spectrum of QNPC12-700 exhibits a higher shoulder peak intensity, which results from the C–N and CN (Fig. 4d). The high resolution O 1s spectra of EG-700 and QNPC12-700 are shown in Fig. 4e and f. They can primarily be basically fitted into three peaks. The peaks at 533.7, 532.4, and 531.6 eV are attributed to OC–OH/C–OH, C–O/C–O–C, and CO/O–CO, respectively. Meanwhile, as listed in Table 1, the elemental analysis of XPS reveals that the oxygen and nitrogen contents in the QNPC12-700 are up to 2.77 at% and 5.22 at%, respectively. The increase in oxygen content comes mainly from the oxygen introduced during the activation by KOH. The plentiful nitrogen atoms are beneficial for improving the power density of the supercapacitors.

N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured to analyze the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the QNPC nanohybrids. As shown in Fig. 5a and S7,† all the QNPC nanohybrids exhibit typical type-II isotherms with large H3 hysteresis loops, indicating a plate-like structure with slit-like pores. The hysteresis loop extending from P/P0 = 0.5 to 0.9 demonstrates the presence of mesoporous structures.38,43 Fig. S7b† shows that the pore sizes of the QNPC nanohybrids are mainly in the region of 2.75–3.77 nm, which is lower than the NC-700 sample. The porous properties of the QNPC nanohybrids, including the BET specific surface area (SBET), total pore volume, and average pore diameter, are also summarized in Table 2. With the increase in EG content from 10 wt% to 12 wt% to 14 wt% at 700 °C, SBET increases from 269.2 m2 g−1 to 348.4 m2 g−1, and then decreases to 222.6 m2 g−1, which is direct correlation with the thickness of the nanosheets. It is difficult to form a large number of mesopores by KOH activation on the thin nanosheets of the QNPC14-700 nanohybrid. SBET for the QNPC nanohybrids with 12% EG content increased from 300.3 to 348.4 m2 g−1 when the carbonization temperature increased from 600 to 700 °C. The SBET of QNPC12-800 is lower than that of QNPC12-700, and this result might be assigned to the collapse and shrinkage of pores with the increased carbonization temperature. All of the QNPC nanohybrids show a much higher SBET compared with the EG-700 and NC-700 samples. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm analysis results indicate that the QNPC nanohybrids possess high SBET and appropriate pore diameters. Such a mesoporous and interconnected hierarchical structure provides a favourable path for the transportation and penetration of electrolyte ions, which is of great importance for the fast ion transfer.

3.2 Formation mechanism
Studying the formation mechanism is very important for the directed synthesis of functional materials. The QNPC nanohybrids were prepared by the following processes: firstly, expanded EG was obtained by heating EG using an intermittent microwave method. As presented in Fig. S1a,† the enlarged interlayer distance of graphite could improve the surface area of EG, which facilitates the subsequent intercalation of the Ani monomers. Attentively, the following vacuum-assisted intercalation method plays a vital role for the formation of the QNPC nanohybrids. The Ani molecules were interpolated into the hierarchical open-porous structure and adsorbed on the surfaces of the EG nanosheets homogeneously by the driving force of the vacuum. Subsequently, the Ani monomers would assemble and in situ polymerize on the EG nanosheets, so the quasi-ordered tower-like structural PANI coated on both sides of the EG nanosheets could be formed, as evidenced by Fig. S1c and S1d.† The average lengths of the PANI nanorods are about 100 nm. The morphology of PANI/EG nanohybrids is consistent with the literature reported by Zhang et al.31 The formation of the nanohybrids has been analyzed in previous reports.46 The PANI molecules were deposited and wrapped on the EG nanosheet surfaces effectively by the skeleton-directing EG.
The carbonization process of the PANI/EG nanohybrids was studied by TGA analysis in a N2 atmosphere. As shown in Fig. S8,† for the expanded EG, the onset of decomposition occurs at 650 °C and 40 wt% retention remains at 800 °C. For the PANI/EG12 and PANI samples, all the samples show a little mass loss at around 100 °C due to moisture loss. For the PANI sample, the gradual weight loss between 100 °C and 300 °C is ascribed to the deprotonation of the PANI through the loss of the HCl dopant. The first step before 500 °C is related to the degradation and decomposition of PANI with different degrees of polymerization. The second step, ranging from 500 °C to 800 °C, is related to structural reorganization and densification.47 Herein, the carbonization temperature was set at 500 °C to keep the morphology. In order to achieve better conversion of the molecular structure, the FTIR spectroscopic method was employed to identify the lowest temperature necessary for carbonization. Fig. 6a and S9a† show the FTIR spectra of the pure PANI sample and PANI/EG nanohybrids. The three PANI/EG nanohybrid precursors show characteristic peaks that are all in good agreement with PANI, but a red-shift to lower wavenumbers is exhibited with the increase in EG content. This shift is ascribed to the fact that PANI was successfully intercalated into the interlayers of EG and grew on the surface of the EG layers, so a strong π–π interaction was formed between the aromatic groups in the main chains of PANI and the active functional groups of the EG nanosheets. This result demonstrates that PANI has been successfully grown on the EG nanosheets.48 In the case of the carbonized materials, the QNPC nanohybrids display characteristic peaks similar to that of the PANI/EG nanohybrids (Fig. 6b and S9b†). After carbonization, the CN bonds were gradually reduced to C–N bonds with the increase in carbonization temperature, indicating the volatilization of the nitrogen heteroatom. The intensity of the C–N stretching peak becomes weaker in the order of QNPC12-600 > QNPC12-700 > QNPC12-800, demonstrating that the functional groups of PANI were gradually reduced and decomposed during the carbonization process.14,48 The FTIR characteristics are in agreement with the thermal stability of the PANI/EG nanohybrids in the TGA curves. The hydrogen and nitrogen atoms in PANI continuously escaped and the carbon skeleton remained at a high carbonization temperature. The carbon skeleton of PANI would gradually shrink and the thickness of the carbonized PANI would become relatively thinner with the increase in carbonization temperature. Therefore, the controllable preparation of 2D porous structured QNPC nanohybrids could be realized by controlling the carbonization temperature.

On the basis of the above analyses, a rational formation process was proposed, as illustrated in Scheme 2. First, the EG graphite formed expanded EG by the driving force of the microwave assistant. The enlarged interlayer distance of EG is beneficial for the intercalation of the Ani monomers under the vacuum-assisted intercalation method, which could ensure the uniform covering of the Ani monomers on the surface of the graphite layer. Then, the assembly of the Ani molecules was directed, and in situ polymerization simultaneously occurred on the surface of the EG layer, accompanied by the exfoliation of EG to form a PANI/graphite nanosheet nanohybrid. In the next carbonization process, the PANI could be transferred to an N-doped carbon coating on the surface of the graphite nanosheets. Finally, the QNPC nanohybrids were synthesized by a subsequent chemical activation process.

3.3 Electrochemical performance
Due to the advantages of the open-type hierarchical porous nanosheets structure and the nitrogen-doped matrix that give the QNPC nanohybrids potential application in energy storage, the corresponding electrochemical behaviour was investigated using a three-electrode cell in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Fig. 7a shows the CV curves of QNPC12-700, NC-700 and EG-700 electrodes recorded at a constant scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the potential range of −1.0 to −0.1 V. The CV profile for the QNPC12-700 electrode exhibits a quasi-rectangular shape, indicating that the capacitive response comes from an ideal double-layer capacitor. Notably, a weak redox current at around −0.8 V is present on the CV curves of the QNPC12-700 electrode, which can be ascribed to the pseudo-capacitive contribution from redox reactions of the doped-nitrogen (e.g. N-5 and N-6) in a carbon matrix.27,29,45,49 In order to further verify the effect of doped-nitrogen on the pseudo-capacitance, a series of reference samples with various nitrogen contents were prepared and studied (see details in ESI, Fig. S10–S13 and Table S1†). In addition, the N-Q of the QNPC12-700 nanohybrid could facilitate electron transport due to its positive charge.45 Thus, the capacitive response of the QNPC nanohybrids results from the combination of electrical double-layer capacitance and pseudo-capacitance. The CV curves of the QNPC electrodes are shown in Fig. S14a.† The QNPC14-700 electrode exhibits a less rectangular shape and a smaller redox current than the other QNPC electrodes, indicating its low capacitance owing to few nitrogen atoms contributed from PANI. The current density of the QNPC12-700 electrode is the highest when compared with the other QNPC samples.
 Fig. 7  Electrochemical properties of QNPC12-700, NC-700 and EG-700 electrodes in 6 M KOH electrolyte: (a) CV curves at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the potential range of −1.0 to −0.1 V (vs. SCE); (b) Nyquist plots at frequencies from 10 mHz to 100 kHz; (c) GCD tests of the materials at 1 A g−1; (d) specific capacitances with various current densities from 0.3 to 20 A g−1. 

Fig. 7b and S14b† show the Nyquist plots of the QNPC electrodes and the equivalent circuit for fitting. The Nyquist plots exhibit a typical semicircle in the high-frequency region and a straight line in the low frequency region. The QNPC12-700 electrode exhibits a smaller semicircular diameter in the high frequency region than the other electrodes, suggesting that higher conductivity is achieved. Additionally, the QNPC12-700 electrode shows a more vertical shape at low frequencies, also indicating a higher capacitive behaviour. The high conductivity greatly contributes to the electrochemical energy storage capacity of the supercapacitors. Rs is related to the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, and the electronic conductivity of the electrodes and current collectors, which is the sum of the contact resistance and material resistance. The QNPC12-700 electrode has a lower Rs of 0.2547 Ω (Table S2†), indicating that the QNPC12-700 electrode has high conductivity due to the presence of graphite nanosheets as current collectors. Rct is the resistance blocking ions from entering the pores of the electrode material, and blocking the movement of ions in solution and the separator. The Rct for the QNPC12-700 electrode is the lowest (about 0.4122 Ω), implying a relatively lower interface resistance of ion adsorption–desorption. Consequently, the good supercapacitor performance presented by the QNPC12-700 electrode is the result of various factors, including the hierarchical porous structure, excellent conductivity and nitrogen-doping.

Fig. 7c and S14c† presents the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves of the QNPC nanohybrids at a current rate of 1 A g−1. The GCD curves demonstrate a typical triangle shape between −1.0 V to −0.1 V without obvious IR drop. The specific capacitance of QNPC12-700 (305.7 F g−1) is slightly higher than those of QNPC12-600 (272.9 F g−1), QNPC12-800 (249.2 F g−1), QNPC10-700 (234.1 F g−1) and QNPC14-700 (206.6 F g−1), which is consistent with the values of the specific surface area. It is found that the specific capacitances of the QNPC nanohybrids are much higher than those of the NC-700 (144.9 F g−1) and EG-700 (33.3 F g−1). Notably, the QNPC12-700 exhibits higher capacitance than most reported carbon materials with graphene-like nanostructures30,38,50,51 or derived from PANI13,14,42,52 (Tables S3 and S4†). This is due to the QNPC12-700 nanohybrid combining the advantages of 2D planar structured carbon materials and nitrogen-containing carbonized PANI. A high specific capacitance is achieved by the synergistic effects. Fig. 7d and S14d† show the rate capability performance of samples evaluated by GCD at current densities of 0.3–20 A g−1. In general, the specific capacitance decreases gradually with the increase in charge current density, which is ascribed to there being inadequate time for electrolyte diffusion at a short charge time. Upon changing the current density from 0.3 to 20.0 A g−1, the QNPC12-700, QNPC12-600, QNPC12-800, QNPC10-700, and QNPC14-700 electrodes keep capacitance retention rates of 66.9%, 61.2%, 59.8%, 48.1% and 51.0%, respectively. The specific capacitance of QNPC12-700 declines more slowly than other samples, indicating that it could be a promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications. The PANI and PANI/EG12 samples were studied as electrode materials in 1 M H2SO4 solution for comparison. As shown in Fig. S15,† the PANI and PANI/EG12 electrodes exhibit redox peaks in CV curves, and the almost symmetric GCD curves indicate the presence of pseudo-capacitive behaviour. Notably, the specific capacitance of the PANI/EG12 electrode is 425.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is much higher than that of the PANI electrode. However, both the PANI and PANI/EG12 electrodes present poor rate-capability and cyclic stability due to the pseudo-capacitive nature of PANI. The QNPC12-700 electrode shows a well-developed rectangular CV curve, the lowest charge transfer resistance and the highest capacitance, which can be attributed to its unique characteristics as follows: firstly, the open-type hierarchical porous nanosheet structure could facilitate electrolyte ions transport over the whole surface of the material through the formation of electrochemical double layers. Secondly, the inner layered graphite nanosheets, as a self-supported skeleton with excellent electrical conductivity, would be beneficial to electron transport in the electrodes to achieve the high-rate performance and good stability. Thirdly, nitrogen-doping could improve the electrical conductivity and wettability, leading to an increase in the electrochemical activity and promoting the pseudo-capacitance. Therefore, the QNPC12-700 electrode obtained a much higher capacitance than the other electrode due to the synergistic effect of the above factors. In addition, the thickness of the porous carbon coating on graphite nanosheets derived from PANI also plays an important influence on the energy storage performance. When the layer is too thick, it is not beneficial for the transport of electrons among the graphite nanosheets (QNPC12-600 and QNPC10-700 nanohybrids). On the contrary, if the layer is too thin, it will result in a relatively lower capacitance (QNPC12-800 and QNPC14-700 nanohybrids), due to it not facilitating the rapid diffusion of electrolyte and there being relatively little nitrogen. Therefore, only a moderate thickness of the porous carbon coating on the graphite nanosheets can meet the requirements of both the rapid diffusion of electrolyte ions and the transport of electrons, resulting in an excellent capacitive performance, such as that demonstrated by the QNPC12-700 nanohybrid.
To completely determine the material performance and simulate the actual device behaviour of QNPC12-700 electrode, further measurements were performed in a two-electrode symmetric system by using both aqueous (6 M KOH) and ionic liquid (1 M Et4NBF4-PC) electrolytes. As shown in Fig. 8a and b, the QNPC12-700 device exhibits rectangular shaped CV curves, which is the characteristic of an ideal double-layer capacitor with little electrolyte diffusion limitation. The rectangular shapes can be maintained without drastic change at a high scan rate of 100 mV s−1, which is attributed to the hierarchical porous structure being favourable towards fast ionic motion. In order to further investigate the capacitive performance of the QNPC12-700 devices, GCD experiments were done at various current densities. The GCD curves and the specific capacitance of devices calculated from the curves are presented in Fig. 8c–e. The specific capacitances of the cells are 75.1 F g−1 and 72.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in aqueous and ionic liquid electrolytes. The specific capacitances of the QNPC12-700 electrode material are 300.4 F g−1 and 290.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH and 1 M Et4NBF4-PC electrolytes, respectively. The supercapacitor using an aqueous electrolyte shows a higher specific capacitance at a low current density compared with the supercapacitor using an ionic liquid electrolyte. However, the specific capacitance decreased obviously with the increase in current density. It is indicated that the supercapacitor could show an excellent performance in 1 M Et4NBF4-PC electrolyte when at high current density. The energy densities and power densities of the symmetric supercapacitors based on the QNPC12-700 electrode are shown in the Ragone plots (Fig. 8f). The supercapacitor delivers a high energy density of 11.5 Wh kg−1 at a low power density of 144.3 W kg−1 and still retains 4.9 Wh kg−1 at a high power density of 8.3 kW kg−1 in an aqueous electrolyte. Notably, the supercapacitor exhibits an extremely high energy density of about 95.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 449.7 W kg−1, and a remarkable energy density of 69.5 Wh kg−1 could be achieved at a high power density of 29.7 kW kg−1 in an ionic liquid electrolyte. The remarkable power performance in both aqueous and ionic liquid electrolytes is much better than that of recently reported carbon-based supercapacitors.38,42,50,51 Moreover, there is no large decrease in the energy density upon going towards higher power densities in 1 M Et4NBF4-PC electrolyte, compared with in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Thus, the QNPC12-700 nanohybrid promises high power delivery without a major reduction in energy density.

To investigate the cycling stability of the QNPC12-700 based devices with different electrolytes, GCD tests were performed at a constant current density of 5 A g−1 for 10000 cycles (Fig. 9). 91.4% and 88.5% of the initial specific capacitance was still retained in 1 M Et4NBF4-PC and 6 M KOH, respectively. Importantly, the Coulombic efficiency of the devices based on the QNPC12-700 electrode still remained above 99% after 10000 cycles. In addition, the stable GCD curves for the last 5 cycles indicate that the repetitive GCD tests do not induce observable changes. It is demonstrated that the QNPC12-700 supercapacitor exhibits good cycling stability and high charge–discharge reversibility in both ionic liquid and aqueous electrolytes. The supercapacitor devices based on the QNPC12-700 electrode show potential for practical application.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized QNPC nanohybrids composed of tower-like N-enriched porous carbon coated on an ultrathin graphite nanosheet framework by a facile strategy from a low-cost raw material. Because of the significantly enhanced electron transport and ion diffusion originating from the inner layer graphite nanosheets and the outer open-type hierarchical porous carbon nanostructures, respectively, and the doped nitrogen that improved the electrical conductivity and capacitance, the QNPC nanohybrids exhibit outstanding energy storage performance in both 6 M KOH and ionic liquid electrolytes. As a result, the obtained QNPC nanohybrids reach excellent specific capacitance, a high energy density and power density, and long-term electrochemical stability. Together with the convenient preparation and low cost, the present 2D quasi-ordered structure QNPC nanohybrids have great potential for application in high-performance energy storage devices.
