    , Accepted 12th September 2018First published on 13th September 2018AbstractOrganic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention as an alternative renewable photovoltaic technology with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) > 22%, which is on par with established technologies. The state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene) is the most successful hole-transport material (HTM) employed in PSCs. Recently, various types of spiro-linked organic small molecules have been reported to overcome the reported disadvantages of spiro-OMeTAD, such as a complex synthetic route, high synthetic cost, and requirement for hygroscopic dopants to improve the charge-carrier mobility and device performance, which significantly limits spiro-OMeTAD for large-scale application in the future. Herein, we provide an overview of recent developments in the design, synthesis, and characterization of spiro-linked organic small molecules as hole-transport materials (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs).Yi-Ling DuDr Sivakumar Gangala is a Postdoctoral Fellow since February 2017 in Prof. Rajneesh Misra's research group in the Indian Institute of Technology-Indore, India.

1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites have attracted great attention for next-generation photovoltaic technology due to their impressive opto-electronic properties, such as intense light harvesting,1,2 small exciton binding energies,3 long diffusion lengths, high charge-carrier mobility, and long lifetime.4,5 Since the first report of perovskite-based solar cell by Miyasaka and co-workers in 2009,6 this photovoltaic technology has rapidly developed in the past 8 years with the power conversion efficiency improving from 3.8% to 22.7%.7 The general representation of a perovskite material is ABX3, where A is a monovalent organic methylammonium (CH3NH3) ion or formamidinium (NH = CHNH3) ion, B is a Pb, Sn, Cs, or Cd ion, and X can be a halogen ion, I−, Br−, or Cl−. Methyl ammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) has been most widely studied perovskite material for solar cell applications due to its wide absorption spectrum up to 800 nm, absorption coefficient of 1.5 × 104 cm−1 at 550 nm,8 high charge-carrier mobility, low exciton binding energy (<10 meV),9 and long electron- and hole-diffusion lengths (up to 1 mm).10 The perovskite solar cell (PSC) technology evolved from dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) technology, where the active dyes and liquid hole-transporting material (HTM) in the DSSC device structure were replaced by perovskite nanocrystals and solid-state semiconducting small molecules or polymers, respectively. Based on whether an electron-transport layer (ETL) or hole-transporting layer (HTL) is deposited over the transparent conducting oxide (TCO), PSCs are classified as conventional (n–i–p) or inverted (p–i–n) devices, respectively. The n–i–p/p–i–n architecture can be classified into two major categories: mesoscopic, employing a metal oxide semiconductor layer as the ETL/HTL with an additional n-type/p-type compact layer (CL) over it, and planar, without a mesoporous layer but employing only a CL (Fig. 1).11

The role of the HTM in PSCs is to extract holes from the perovskites and to transport them to the electrode. The basic characteristics of HTMs for PSC application can be summarized as: (i) the HOMO level must be located above the HOMO level of the perovskite, (ii) the hole mobility should be >10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in order to conduct the hole and prevent charge recombination, (iii) the glass transition temperature should be above 100 °C to avoid crystallization, (iv) for the mesoscopic architecture, an adequate pore-filling property is required, (v) to avoid the absorption screen effect toward the perovskite, the HTM film needs to be transparent in the visible spectrum, and (vi) for solution processing, HTMs should be soluble in organic solvents that will not attack the perovskite layer.12 To date, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) remains the most studied HTM for PSCs, with an impressive power conversion efficiency of ∼20.8%.13 Unfortunately, the synthesis of spiro-OMeTAD involves lengthy and low yielding synthetic procedures and purification requires costly sublimation steps, which makes it highly expensive. In pristine form, it exhibits low conductivity and low hole mobility, and thus requires additives and chemical p-dopants, such as bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (LiTFSI), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and cobalt(III) complexes, to enhance its conductivity and hole mobility. However, the use of an ionic salt to improve the charge-carrier mobility is seen as a tradeoff for stability of the device due to them causing degradation of the perovskite layer. To address these disadvantages, several organic small molecules,14–17 conducting polymers,18 organometallic complexes,19–21 and inorganic semiconductors22,23 have been reported as HTMs for PSCs with remarkable photovoltaic properties. Among the various types of HTMs, organic small molecules have attracted great attention due to their good solution processability, structural variety, easier purification methods, less batch-to-batch variability, and ease of infiltration into the nanostructured material.24 The major advantage of small molecules is that they are attractive for industrial production due to their facile synthesis process with high purity and yield, which is beneficial for the large-scale application of PSCs.
The search for novel small molecule HTMs, which retain the advantages and address the disadvantages of spiro-OMeTAD, has attracted much attention from the scientific community. To date, many groups have reported numerous small molecule HTMs, but only a few HTMs have been demonstrated to achieve values close to or beyond a PCE of 20%. The majority of small molecules with the highest PCE were designed based on the spiro concept, connecting two molecular π-systems via a common sp3-hybridized atom. Some of the highly efficient spiro-linked HTMs with PCEs >19% are depicted in Fig. 2, which exhibit clear cost advantages and more facile purification methods over spiro-OMeTAD. The spiro concept has been the most successful strategy to design efficient HTMs for PSC due to their symmetric globular structure, large molecular weight, and small intermolecular cohesion, resulting in a high stability in the amorphous state.

In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances in the design and development of spiro-linked organic small molecules as HTMs for mesoscopic and planar heterojunction PSCs (Table 1). The spiro-linked organic small molecules are classified based on their spiro core and their photophysical, electrochemical, thermal, and photovoltaic properties are discussed in detail. The cost analysis and device stability, which are very important for the large-scale application of PSCs, are also presented. For better understanding the structure–property relationship of the different spiro cores, a comparative analysis is depicted in Table 2.

2. Spiro-linked organic small molecules
The spiro-based small molecules based on the concept of connecting two molecular π-systems via a common sp3-hybridized atom are the most promising HTMs for PSCs. These molecules preferably acquire an orthogonal arrangement due to the presence of an sp3-hybridized atom at the junction of two molecular π-systems. This type of molecular arrangement provides a number of advantages, such as (i) highly sterically demanding structure, which induces rigidity in the molecule, (ii) high glass transition temperature (Tg), (iii) it impedes crystallization below the glass transition temperature (Tg) effectively and enhances the stability of the amorphous state, and (iv) increased solubility due to weak intermolecular π–π interactions.25 The first spiro-based HTM reported for PSCs, spiro-OMeTAD was constructed by the spiro-bifluorene core, and inspired the scientific community to develop a wide range of HTMs with different spiro structures. Herein, we classify the spiro-linked organic small molecules based on a spiro core and discuss the structure–property relationships in detail to assist building knowledge to aid in the design of cost-effective, dopant-free, and efficient HTMs to replace conventional spiro-OMeTAD.
2.1. 9,9′-Spirobi[fluorene] (SBF)-based HTMs
SBF can be synthesized by reacting Grignard reagent from the 2-bromobiphenyl reaction with 9-fluorenone followed by acid treatment. SBF is then brominated using ferric chloride as the catalyst. The low reactivity of SBF toward electrophilic bromination results in multibrominated products, leading to a low yield and tedious subsequent purification steps (Fig. 3).

SBF-based 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) has been one of the most commonly used and successful HTMs in PSCs and has shown the best performance in terms of efficiency. Recently, Qi and co-workers reviewed the advances in spiro-MeOTAD as HTMs for PSCs and discussed several issues related to spiro-MeOTAD, such as cost performance, long-term stability, degradation issues, coating technologies compatibility, reliance on additives, and the hysteresis effect.27 Park et al. were the first to report spiro-OMeTAD as an HTM for PSC by replacing the liquid-electrolyte analog in the solid-state mesoscopic heterojunction solar cell using (CH3NH3)PbI3 perovskite nanoparticles as light harvesters and achieved a high PCE up to 9.7% with increased stability of the device.28 The pristine spiro-OMeTAD had a low charge mobility and poor conductivity due to its inherent triangular pyramidal configuration, which lead to large intermolecular distances.29,30 The hole mobility of the spiro-OMeTAD can be improved by the addition of dopants, such as lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl) imide (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP), which can suppress charge recombination and improve the contact between the perovskite layer and HTM.31 In addition to these two additives, several Co(III) complexes have been investigated to further improve the hole mobility of spiro-OMeTAD. Snaith et al. reported a PCE of ∼10.9% (ref. 32) for PSCs employing a mixed-halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) coated on a conducting scaffold of Al2O3 as an absorber and spiro-OMeTAD as an HTM. Using the compositional engineering of mixed perovskite [(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15], Seok et al. reported a maximum PCE of 19%.33 Li et al. reported a simple vacuum flash-assisted solution processing method to prepare high electronic quality film over a large area exceeding ∼1 cm2 and made reproducible and hysteresis-free PSC devices employing doped spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM with a PCE of ∼20.5% (certified PCE of ∼19.6%).34 Tress et al. reported a PCE of 20.8% for PSCs employing mixed perovskite and doped spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM in a mesoscopic configuration.13
Nguyen et al. reported pre-oxidized HTM spiro(TFSI)2 (2), a dicationic salt of spiro-OMeTAD, which could increase the conductivity of the spiro-OMeTAD up to 10−3 S cm−1 without relying on oxidation in air.35 This was synthesized through the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD with silver bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Ag-TFSI). The devices made with spiro(TFSI)2 (2) exhibited a similar PCE but improved operating stability when illuminated continuously under an inert atmosphere as compared to the conventional LiTFSI-doped spiro-OMeTAD.
Seok et al. demonstrated the effect of the position of the OMe substituent in spiro-OMeTAD by changing its position from para to meta and ortho.36 They synthesized pp- (3), pm- (4), and po-spiro-OMeTAD (5) derivatives as HTMs for MAPbI3 perovskite-based solar cells. The absorption maxima of pp- (3), pm- (4), and po-spiro-OMeTAD (5) were centered at 387, 387, and 381 nm, respectively. The change in OMe substitution from para to meta resulted in a decrease in the HOMO level (−5.22 to −5.31 eV), whereas ortho position substitution resulted in an increase in the LUMO level (−2.28 to −2.18 eV) without effecting the HOMO level. The highest PCE of 16.7% and lowest PCE of 13.9% were obtained for po-spiro-OMeTAD (5) and pm-spiro-OMeTAD (4), respectively, compared with pp-spiro-OMeTAD (5) (14.9%). The authors attributed the highest PCE obtained for po-spiro-OMeTAD (5) to its low Rs and high Rsh, which resulted in increased FF.
Jin et al. reported two HTMs, namely CzPAF-SBF (6) and CzPAF-SBFN (7), which consisted of phenylcarbazole and fluorene groups as the main scaffold, and 9,9′-spirobifluorene/9,9′-spirobifluorene-7-carbonitrile as the end cap units.37 The synthesis cost of CzPAF-SBF (6) and CzPAF-SBFN (7) (≤$150 per g) was cheaper compared to spiro-OMeTAD (∼$400 per g). The absorption maxima of CzPAF-SBF (6) and CzPAF-SBFN (7) were observed at 377 nm and 396 nm, respectively. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.26/−2.37 and −5.27/−2.57 eV for CzPAF-SBF (6) and CzPAF-SBFN (7), respectively. The slightly deeper HOMO levels of CzPAF-SBF (6) and CzPAF-SBFN (7) compared with the benchmark HTM, spiro-OMeTAD, resulted in a higher VOC. Both the compounds exhibited good thermal stability with a thermal decomposition temperature (Td) > 400 °C. The hole mobilities of Li-salt-doped CzPAF-SBF (6) and CzPAF-SBFN (7), and spiro-OMeTAD were calculated as 1.27 × 10−3, 5.07 × 10−4, and 9.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The authors attributed the lower mobility of CzPAF-SBFN to the introduction of an electron-withdrawing CN group on 9,9′-spirobifluorene. A PCE of 17.21% (JSC ≈ 20.94 mA cm−2; VOC ≈ 1.09 V; FF ≈ 75.40%) and 16.04% (JSC ≈ 20.40 mA cm−2; VOC ≈ 1.04 V; FF ≈ 75.60%) were reported for CzPAF-SBF (6) and CzPAF-SBFN (7), respectively, under AM 1.5 G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The PCEs of PSCs with spiro-OMeTAD and CzPAF-SBF (6) as the HTM retained 45% and 71% of their initial efficiency after storing unencapsulated devices for ∼500 h.
Huang et al. demonstrated the effect of heteroatom substitution by replacing the para-methoxy substituent in spiro-OMeTAD with methylsulfanyl (spiro-S (8)), N,N-dimethylamino (spiro-N (9)), and ethyl (spiro-E (10)) groups.38 The UV-vis spectra of spiro-S (8), spiro-N (9), and spiro-E (10) were measured in chlorobenzene solvent, and it was found that the absorption maxima of these HTMs were centered at 420, 470, and 492 nm, respectively. HOMO energy levels of −4.92, −4.42, and −4.81 were calculated for spiro-S (8), spiro-N (9), and spiro-E (10), respectively. Spiro-S (8), spiro-N (9), and spiro-E (10) exhibited good thermal stability with Td of 372 °C, 426 °C, and 430 °C. The hole mobilities of spiro-OMeTAD, spiro-S (8), spiro-N (9), and spiro-E (10) were measured as 1.55 × 10−5, 1.90 × 10−5, 0.25 × 10−5, and 1.26 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The open-circuit voltage of the devices with spiro-E (10) and spiro-S (8) (1.07 V and 1.06 V) were a little higher than spiro-OMeTAD due to their lower HOMO energy level as compared to spiro-OMeTAD. The larger contact angles of spiro-S (8) (91.5°) and spiro-E (10) (82.5°), and spiro-MeOTAD (78.7°) compared to spiro-N (9) (70.0°) indicated the greater hydrophobicity of spiro-S (8) and spiro-E (10), which is beneficial for growing larger grain sizes and better quality perovskite polycrystalline films. The PCEs of the corresponding perovskite solar cells made up of spiro-OMeTAD, spiro-E (10), spiro-N (9), and spiro-S (8) were 11.55%, 15.75%, 11.92%, and 15.92%, respectively.
Shi et al. reported a new HTM, spiro-027 (11) by replacing two 4,4′-dimethoxyl-diphenylamine at the 2′ and 7′ positions of conventional spiro-OMeTAD with two tert-butyl groups.39 The absorption, energy levels (HOMO/LUMO) and thermal stability of spiro-027 (11) were similar to that of spiro-OMeTAD, inferring that the tert-butyl substitution at the 2′ and 7′ positions of spirobifluorene have almost no influence on the optical, electrochemical, and thermal properties. The hole mobility of pristine spiro-027 (11) (4.99 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) was slightly higher than that of pristine spiro-OMeTAD (2.19 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). The device employing spiro-027 (11) as an HTM exhibited a PCE of 16.60% (JSC ≈ 22.07 mA cm−2; VOC ≈ 1.07 V; FF ≈ 70%), which was a little higher than the spiro-OMeTAD-based device with a PCE of 16.12% (JSC ≈ 21.47 mA cm−2; VOC ≈ 1.06 V; FF ≈ 71%).
The role of the methoxy group's position in the spiro-OMeTAD on the electronic properties of the hole conductor was studied by Zhang et al.40 They synthesized two derivatives of spiro-OMeTAD with asymmetric methoxy substituents, 2,4-spiro-OMeTAD (12) and 3,4-spiro-OMeTAD (13), by replacing the position of p-OMe groups in each of the quadrants of spiro-OMeTAD with o-OMe + p-OMe groups as well as m-OMe + p-OMe substituents, respectively. The absorption maxima of 2,4-spiro-OMeTAD (12) and 3,4-spiro-OMeTAD (13) were observed at 370 nm and 383 nm, respectively. The HOMO energy levels of 2,4-spiro-OMeTAD (12) and 3,4-spiro-OMeTAD (13) were calculated as −5.24 and −5.26, respectively. The PSC device employing 2,4-spiro-OMeTAD (12) as an HTM exhibited a PCE of 17.2% (JSC = 25.6 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.956 V, and a FF = 0.701), which was higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (15.0%), whereas 3,4-spiro-OMeTAD (13)-based devices delivered a lower efficiency of 9.1%, with a JSC of 20.1 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.752 V, and an FF of 0.599. The devices based on 2,4-spiro-OMeTAD (12) retained 90.1% of the initial PCE even after 504 h, indicating excellent stability (Fig. 4).

2.2. Spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX)-based HTMs
In 2006, Xie et al. reported the one-pot synthesis of SFX using inexpensive phenol and 9-fluorenone as the starting materials with a yield of 80%.41 Since then, it has attracted much attention from the organic electronics community aiming to develop low-cost and efficient organic materials. Robertson et al. reported cost estimations of SBF and SFX core moieties.42 The synthetic cost of SBF ranged from $35 per g to $44 per g, whereas SFX was about $1.09 per g, which is around 30 times lower than that of SBF. In order to replace the most successful SBF core, which involves high cost and complex synthesis, research on SFX as an alternative for SBF is thus considered a viable route (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  One-pot synthesis of SFX.41 
In a search for low-cost HTMs for PSCs to replace the costly standard spiro-OMeTAD, Sun et al. reported the SFX-based HTM X59 (14), which was synthesized via a simple synthetic route from commercial precursors.43 The absorption maxima of X59 (14) were centered at 308 nm and 387 nm, similar to spiro-OMeTAD. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels were calculated as −5.15/−2.10 eV. Further, X59 (14) exhibited intrinsic hole mobility and doped conductivity (5.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.9 × 10−4 S cm−1) comparable to that of spiro-OMeTAD (8.09 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 8.1 × 10−5 S cm−1). The device made with pristine X59 (14) exhibited a poor PCE of 1.1%, whereas X59 (14) doped with LiTFSI and tBP resulted in enhanced performance with a PCE of 17.6% (JSC = 22.9 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.07, and FF = 0.71). The best device made with X59 (14) doped with FK209 yielded a PCE of 19.8% (JSC = 23.4 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.13, and FF = 0.73), which was comparable to the PCE of the device made with spiro-OMeTAD under the same conditions (20.8%). Further, highly optimized devices exhibited minimized hysteresis, excellent reproducibility, and promising stability under dark and dry conditions.
Robertson et al. reported four low-cost SFX derivatives, SFX-MeOTAD (15), SFX-TAD (16), SFX-TPTZ (17), and SFX-TCz (18), with SFX as the central core and 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine, diphenylamine, phenothiazine, and carbazole as appending units.42 The synthesis cost of SFX-MeOTAD (15) ($17 per g) was more than five times lower than the spiro-MeOTAD (from $92 per g to $108 per g). SFX-TPTZ (17) exhibited one broad absorption band with a maximum at 310 nm, whereas SFX-MeOTAD (15), SFX-TAD (16), and SFX-TCz (18) exhibited two absorption bands at 307, 367; 307, 379, and 291, 340 nm, respectively. The HOMO energy levels of SFX-MeOTAD (15), SFX-TAD (16), SFX-TPTZ (17), and SFX-TCz (18) were calculated as −5.1, −5.34, −5.39, and −5.70, respectively. The device made with SFX-MeOTAD (15) resulted in a PCE of 12.4% with a JSC of 21.38 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.98 mV, and an FF of 59.0, whereas a PCE of 13.0% (JSC of 23.16 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.92 mV, and a FF of 61.3) was observed for the device using spiro-OMeTAD.
Sun et al. reported two SFX-based 3D oligomers X54 (19) and X55 (20) with different numbers of SFX-functionalized triarylamine-based monomers as HTMs for PSCs.44 The absorption spectra for X54 (19) and X55 (20) were recorded in toluene and it was found that the absorption maxima were centered at 380 and 406 nm, respectively. The X54 (19) and X55 (20) exhibited good thermal stability with Tg/Td of 134/441 °C and 174/446 °C, respectively. The HOMO energy levels of X54 (19) and X55 (20) were 5.30 and 5.23 eV versus vacuum, respectively, which were 0.17 and 0.10 eV deeper than that of spiro-OMeTAD (5.13 eV), suggesting that X54 (19) and X55 (20) could offer higher open-circuit voltages (VOC) in PSC devices. The hole mobility of X54 (19) and X55 (20) were measured as 8.25 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.81 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The devices made with X55 (20) as the HTM showed a remarkably high PCE of 20.8%, which was much higher than the PCEs of the reference spiro-OMeTAD (18.8%) and X54 (19) (13.6%)-based devices. The authors attributed the low performance of X54 (19) was due to the poor solubility in chlorobenzene, resulting in poor film morphology. The better photovoltaic performance of X55 was attributed to its better hole-extracting and -transporting capabilities. The X55-based devices exhibited excellent stability under a controlled atmosphere with 93% retention of the initial PCE after 6 months aging.
Liu et al. reported four SFX-based HTMs (mp-SFX-3PA (21) and mp-SFX-2PA (22), mm-SFX-3PA (23), and mm-SFX-2PA (24)) functionalized with four-armed arylamine moieties located at different positions.45 These four compounds in solution exhibited two absorption bands around 300 and 350 nm similar to spiro-OMeTAD. The HOMO energy levels of mp-SFX-3PA (21) and mm-SFX-3PA (23) were estimated as −5.08 eV, lower than those of mp-SFX-2PA (22) and mm-SFX-2PA (24) (−4.92 and −4.89 eV). These four compounds, mp-SFX-3PA (21) and mp-SFX-2PA (22), mm-SFX-3PA (23), and mm-SFX-2PA (24) exhibited good thermal stability with Td of 437 °C, 418 °C, 420 °C, and 261 °C, respectively. The average hole mobility of mp-SFX-2PA (22) in the pristine state was 3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, higher than those of mp-SFX-3PA (21), mm-SFX-3PA (23) and mm-SFX-2PA (24) (4.0–8.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The device employing mp-SFX-2PA (22) as the HTM exhibited the best PCE of 16.8%, which was slightly superior to that of the device based on spiro-OMeTAD (15.5%). The authors attributed the improved photovoltaic performance to their higher hole mobility, slightly deeper HOMO energy level, and better charge-extraction and -transport capability. The stability tests revealed unencapsulated mp-SFX-2PA (22)-based devices retained 90% of the initial PCEs after 2000 h storage, while the average PCE of the spiro-OMeTAD-based devices retained only 28% of the initial PCEs under ambient conditions (20 ± 5 °C, 15 ± 5% relative humidity).
Wu et al. demonstrated the effect of structural modification of SFX-bridged triphenylamine-based HTMs (BTPA-4 (25), BTPA-5 (26), and BTPA-6 (27)) on the device performance.46 The synthesis cost of these materials was about one-third of that for the preparation of spiro-OMeTAD. The absorption maxima for BTPA-4 (25), BTPA-5 (26), and BTPA-6 (27) were observed at 384, 385, and 356 nm, respectively. The HOMO energy levels of the three HTMs were rather similar and located around −5.35 eV. These three compounds exhibited good thermal stability with Td > 400 °C. The BTPA-6 (27)-based device yielded the highest PCE of 11.57% with a JSC of 20.57 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.97 mV, and an FF of 0.57. The authors attributed this highest PCE to the highest IPCE value in the visible region, the highest hole-extraction ability, and the largest recombination resistance at the TiO2/perovskite/HTM interface. The stability of devices made with the three HTMs was superior to the spiro-OMeTAD-based device.
SFX-based organic HTMs substituted with different pyridine groups were reported by Xu et al. to realize tBP-free organic HTMs for stable and efficient planar PSCs.47 In tBP-free HTMs XOP (29), XMP (30), and XPP (31), the pyridine units were covalently linked to SFX core at the ortho, meta, and para positions, respectively. All three HTMs exhibited similar HOMO energy levels of 5.15 eV and hole mobility around 1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to their similar structures. Among the three HTMs, XPP (31) with two para-position substituted pyridine delivered a high PCE of 17.2% in tBP-free planar CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs and 19.5% in mixed-ion [HC(NH2)2]0.85[CH3NH3]0.15Pb[I0.85Br0.15]3− based planar PSCs. Under similar conditions, the PSC device employing spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM exhibited a PCE of 5.5%. XOP (29), XMP (30), and XPP (31)-based PSC devices showed superior long-term stability compared to the spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs containing tBP as an additive (Fig. 6).

2.3. 4,4′-Spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene] (SCPDT)-based HTMs
Thiophene-based spiro core, SCPDT was developed by Salbeck and co-workers,49 but the synthetic pathway was not disclosed. Later Pozzi et al.48 reported five step synthetic route for SCPDT with 77% yield. Due to high electron density and low aromaticity of thiophene than benzene SCPDT is ready for the redox reaction compare to SBF. The optical, electrochemical, and electrical properties of the SCPDT based analogues were found to be very different to those analogues of SBF (Fig. 7). The first HTM based on SCBDT for PSCs was reported by Ma et al. with the molecular architecture of SCPDT as the central core appending four 5-octyl-2,2′-bithiophene units as rigid arms.50 SCPDT-BiT (32) exhibited a high Tg (136.9 °C) value compared to spiro-MeOTAD (Tg = 125 °C). The absorption spectrum of SCPDT-BiT (32) in toluene exhibited two absorption bands centered at 322 nm and 467 nm. Compared with spiro-OMeTAD, SCPDT-BiT (32) absorbed part of the visible light due to its extended conjugated structure. The HOMO level of SCPDT-BiT (32) was measured as −5.07 eV, which was slightly lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.04 eV). SCPDT-BiT (32) showed hole mobilities of 4.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.96 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 before and after thermal annealing, respectively. The spiro-OMeTAD exhibited hole mobilities of 1.45 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.37 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 before and after thermal annealing, respectively, under similar conditions. The PSC device with SCPDT-BiT (32) delivered a PCE of 10.39% with a JSC of 16.54 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.94 V, and an FF of 0.67, whereas the device with spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM delivered a PCE of 13.3% with a JSC of 20.83 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.95 V, and an FF of 0.67 under similar conditions.
 Fig. 7  Synthetic route for SCPDT.48 
A structural analog of spiro-OMeTAD, HTM1 (33) was reported by Franckevičius and coworkers51 by replacing SBF with SCPDT. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of HTM1 (33) in dichloromethane (DCM) showed an intense absorption band at 447 nm, which was 60 nm red-shifted compared to spiro-OMeTAD due to the strong electron-donating SCPDT core unit compared to the SBF unit. The HOMO energy level of HTM1 (33) was estimated as −5.00 eV. HTM1 (33) exhibited good thermal stability with a Tg around 150 °C. The hole mobilities of HTM1 (33) and spiro-OMeTAD were measured by applying the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method and found to be 6.0 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 8.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The PSC device made with HTM1 (33) without doping delivered a PCE of 13.4% with a JSC of 19.3 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.97 V, and an FF of 0.72, which were very close to the values for p-doped spiro-OMeTAD devices (PCE = 13.3%, JSC = 21.6 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.95 V, FF = 0.73). In the presence of tBP and LiTFSI additives, HTM1 (33)-based devices exhibited an efficiency between 9% and 10.3% with a JSC up to 13.8 mA cm−2, which upon doping with FK209, the PCE was reduced to 6%. The authors suggested the reason for the low performance of HTM1 (33) upon doping could be due to an unbalanced charge distribution in the perovskite solar cell with the doped HTM1 (33).
The number of HTMs for PSCs based on a SCPDT core is scarce. The aforementioned SCPDT HTMs suffer low hole mobility compared to spiro-OMeTAD. However, HTM1 (33) without doping rivals doped spiro-OMeTAD in terms of efficiency, suggesting SCPDT as a potential spiro core to design dopant-free HTMs. Still there is potential room for research on the SCPDT core to develop novel HTMs and to further establish the structure–property relationships (Fig. 8).

2.4. Spiro-acridine-fluorene (SAF)-based HTMs
The synthesis of SAF involves a minimum number of steps compared to SBF. A lithium derivative of triphenylamine was reacted with fluorenone to yield an alcohol derivative, which upon a Friedel–Crafts intramolecular ring-closure reaction was converted to the SAF. The presence of triphenylamine in the SAF-core would be beneficial for the increased hole mobility of SAF-based HTMs (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  Synthetic route for SAF.52 
Li et al. reported SAF-based HTMs, CW3 (34), CW4 (35), and CW5 (36), in which half of the structure is similar to spiro-OMeTAD and the other half contains the functional acridine unit.53 CW3 (34) (127 °C), CW4 (35) (142 °C), and CW5 (36) (148 °C) exhibited higher Tg values than spiro-OMeTAD (125 °C) and Td in the range of 234–254 °C. The HOMO energy levels of the three compound were located at ∼−4.92 eV. CW3 (34), CW4 (35), CW5 (36), and spiro-OMeTAD exhibited hole conductivities of 5.92, 3.54, 3.09, and 6.14 × 10−6 S cm−1, respectively, and hole mobilities of 1.2, 0.58, 0.87, and 2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively. The PSC devices made with CW4 (35) as the HTM with tBP and LiTFSI as additives outperformed the spiro-OMeTAD (PCE = 14.32%, JSC = 19.35 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.02 V, and FF = 73%)-based device with a PCE of 16.56% (JSC = 21.75 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.05 V, and FF = 72%), whereas CW3 (34) and CW5 (36)-based PSCs exhibited a JSC of 16.49 and 15.39 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.989 V and 1.005 V, FF of 67% and 70%, and PCE of 10.94% and 10.76%, respectively, under similar fabrication conditions.
Wang et al. developed a dopant-free HTM (SAF-OMe (37)) by combining subunits of poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and spiro-OMeTAD.52 It exhibited two absorption bands: one intense band at 320 nm and a weak band at 380 nm. The HOMO energy level of SAF-OMe (37) (−5.07 eV) was comparable to spiro-OMeTAD (−5.22 eV). It exhibited good thermal stability with a high Td/Tg of 425/126 °C. The hole mobility of doped SAF-OMe (37) was measured via the SCLC method under dark conditions as 9.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The PSC device made with doped SAF-OMe (37) achieved a PCE of 16.73% with a JSC of 21.07 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.05 V, and FF of 0.76, which meant it outperformed the doped spiro-OMeTAD-based device with a PCE of 14.84% under identical conditions. The device employing pristine SAF-OMe (37) as the HTM exhibited a PCE of 12.39% with JSC of 20.59 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.97 V, and FF of 0.62, whereas dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD displayed an inferior PCE of 5.91% (JSC of 20.50 mA cm −2, VOC of 0.95 V, and FF of 0.30).
In the direction of research on developing low-cost and efficient HTMs, SAF is a promising spiro-core, with a molecular architecture made up of a combination of sub units of conventional HTMs spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA and requires only a simple synthetic route compared to SBF. As the number of reports on SAF-based HTMs is limited to date, research on the molecular engineering of SAF-based HTMs to fine tune the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, hole mobility, hydrophobicity, and perovskite/HTM/electrode interface interaction etc., still has great scope (Fig. 10).

2.5. Miscellaneous spiro derivatives
Ganesan and co-workers developed a new spiro-type thienodioxepine derivative, PST1 (38), as an HTM with a quasiplanar structure, which facilitated stronger intermolecular interaction.54 The absorption spectrum of PST1 (38) in DCM exhibited two absorption bands in the UV region at 300 and 396 nm, and in the thin film state the maximum absorption band was red-shifted by 38 nm compared to the solution state due to intermolecular π–π stacking. PST1 (38) exhibited a slightly lower HOMO level (−5.15 eV) compared to spiro-OMeTAD (−5.07 eV). The replacement of the SBF linkage in spiro-OMeTAD (Tg = 125 °C) with spiro-bipropylenedioxythiophene in PST1 (38) enhanced the thermal stability with a Tg of 175 °C. They reported crystal patterns of PST1 (38) and spiro-OMeTAD and found that both had completely different types of spiro configuration and multiple CH/π, O–C, and π–π intermolecular short contacts. From the crystal structure of spiro-OMeTAD, they proved that the dopant is essential due to the lack of π–π intermolecular stacking. The PSC device employing PST1 (38) as the HTM with LiTFSI and tBP as additives and FK209 as a dopant exhibited a PCE of 13.44% with a JSC of 17.63 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.02 V, and an FF of 0.73, whereas the device with spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM delivered a PCE of 12.16% with a JSC of 18.6 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.91 V, and an FF of 0.70 under similar conditions. Without-dopant devices were made with PST1 (38)/spiro-OMeTAD producing a PCE of 12.74%/9.57%, JSC of 19.21/19.43 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.93/0.79 V, and an FF of 0.69/0.61.
Nazeeruddin et al. reported a dissymmetric fluorene-dithiophene (FDT (39)) core substituted by N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine donor groups as an HTM for PSCs.55 The central spiro core was designed as a combination of both SBF and SCPDT to take advantage of the peculiar optoelectronic properties of SCPDT derivatives. The lab synthesis costs of FDT (39) were estimated as US$60 per g, whereas purified spiro-OMeTAD cost around US$500 per g (high purity, Merck). The HOMO level of FDT (39) was calculated as 5.16 eV, which was slightly more stabilized than spiro-OMeTAD (5.14 eV). FDT (39) exhibited good thermal stability with a Td above 400 °C and Tg of 110 °C. The device with mixed perovskite [(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15] employing doped FDT (39) as the HTM delivered a best efficiency of 20.2% with a JSC of 22.7 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.148 mV, and an FF of 0.76, whereas the spiro-OMeTAD-based device exhibited a PCE of 19.7%. Stability assessment for unencapsulated FDT devices stored under dry conditions in the dark was conducted and it was found that two months after preparation, there was almost no degradation during this time. The major advantages of FDT (39) are that it can be dissolved in more environmental friendly toluene instead of chlorobenzene and the synthesis cost is low, and was estimated to be about one-fifth of that of spiro-OMeTAD. However, while FDT performed well over conventional spiro-OMeTAD in terms of the cost, efficiency, and stability, it still suffers from the need for the addition of dopants.
Rakstys et al. reported an alternative spiro-annulated HTM (DDOF (40)) based on a dispiro-oxepine system substituted with dimethoxydiphenylamine.56 DDOF (40) exhibited an absorption maximum similar to spiro-OMeTAD in THF around 385 nm. The HOMO energy level of DDOF (40) (−5.07 eV) was slightly more stabilized compared to spiro-OMeTAD (−5.04 eV). DDOF (40) exhibited good thermal stability with a Td of 412 °C and Tg of 157 °C. The device employing DDOF (40) as the HTM outperformed the spiro-OMeTAD (PCE = 18.8%, JSC = 22.44 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.11 V, and FF = 0.75)-based device with a PCE of 19.4% (JSC = 22.37 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.10 V, and FF = 0.79). The authors attributed the high FF of the DDOF (40)-employed device to the thin HTM layer of 100 nm, causing lower series resistance. DDOF (40)-based devices exhibited better stability than the spiro-OMeTAD-based device by maintaining 95% of their initial PCE, whereas the later dropped by 20% under identical conditions.
The regular spiro systems utilized for the synthesis of HTMs for PSC retain four C–C linkages at the spiro carbon center, which leads to symmetrical and monotonous molecular structures. Wang et al. introduced a novel spiro system by incorporating a C–N linkage from phenylpyrazole to diversify the electrical structures through independent regulation of two parts of the spiro systems. By using this novel spiro system they reported three new HTMs (WY-1 (41), WY-2 (42), and WY-3 (43)) with an asymmetric spiro-phenylpyrazole/fluorene architecture for PSCs.57 They systematically studied the effect of structural modification at the orthogonal phenyl pyrazole fragments by varying the π-conjugation and introducing substituents with distinctive steric and electronic properties. The absorption spectra of the three molecules were similar to spiro-OMeTAD with the lowest energy absorption peak in solution centered at 386 nm. WY-1 (41), WY-2 (42), and WY-3 (43) exhibited more stabilized HOMO levels (−5.15 ∼−5.16 eV) compared with spiro-OMeTAD (−5.10 eV). WY-1 (41), WY-2 (42), and WY-3 (43) exhibited good thermal stability with Td/Tg of 401/122 °C, 422/136 °C, and 427/145 °C. The device based on WY-1 (41) exhibited the highest PCE of 14.20% (JSC = 19.48 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.05 V, and FF = 0.69), which was very close to spiro-OMeTAD (PCE = 14.84%, JSC = 19.20 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.04 V, and FF = 0.74). WY-2 (42) and WY-3 (43)-based PSCs exhibited lower photovoltaic performance compared to WY-1 (41) with a PCE of 13.60% and 12.89%, respectively. The authors attributed the best performance of WY-1 (41) to the higher hole mobility relative to that of WY-2 (42) and WY-3 (43).
In continuation of their work on phenylpyrazole-linked spiro-HTMs, Wang et al. reported three new HTMs PPyra-ACD (44), PPyra-XA (45), and PPyra-TXA (46), by inserting nitrogen (acridine), oxygen (xanthene), and sulfur (thioxanthene), respectively, into the phenylpyrazole-linked spiro system.58 The absorption maxima for PPyra-ACD (44), PPyra-XA (45), and PPyra-TXA (46) were centered at 317, 313, and 313 nm, respectively. The HOMO energy levels of PPyra-XA (45) (−5.24 eV) and PPyra-TXA (46) (−5.23 eV) were more stabilized than PPyra-ACD (44) (−4.96 eV) due to the strong electron-donating acridine unit. PPyra-ACD (44), PPyra-XA (45), and PPyra-TXA (46) exhibited good thermal stability with Td/Tg of 409/115 °C, 398/113 °C, and 397/116 °C. The hole mobilities of PPyra-ACD (44), PPyra-XA (45), and PPyra-TXA (46) were measured as 4.39 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 7.03 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 9.14 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, using the SCLC method. The device employing PPyra-TXA (46) as the HTM outperformed the spiro-OMeTAD (16.15%)-based device with a PCE of 18.06% due to its more stabilized HOMO and enhanced hole mobility and it also exhibited the best stability under ambient conditions. The dopant-free device of PPyra-TXA (46) (11.70%) also exhibited a higher efficiency than that of spiro-OMeTAD (8.51%). PPyra-XA (45) and PPyra-ACD (44)-based devices exhibited PCEs of 16.15% and 5.01%, respectively (Fig. 11).

3. Summary and outlook
Among several HTMs, like organic small molecules, conducting polymers, organometallic complexes, and inorganic p-type semiconductors, the majority of HTMs used for PSCs are based on organic small molecules. To date, spiro-OMeTAD remains the most studied HTM for PSCs with an impressive PCE of >20%. The major drawbacks of spiro-OMeTAD are its synthetic complexity, synthetic cost, and need for external doping by ionic salts and additives, which improves its performance but also decreases the stability of devices. To date, the majority of small molecules with highest PCE were designed based on spiro concept. Recently, various spiro-linked organic small molecules have been studied with a molecular architecture consist of spiro cores, such as 9,9′-spirobi[fluorene], spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene], 4,4′-spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1-b; 3,4-b′]dithiophene], spiro-acridine-fluorene, fluorene-dithiophene, dispiro-oxepine, and spiro-phenylpyrazole/fluorine, to address the several drawbacks of conventional spiro-OMeTAD. In this review, we summarized significant progress in spiro-linked organic small molecules as hole-transport materials (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (PSC). However, most spiro-linked organic small molecules can rival spiro-OMeTAD in terms of cost and efficiency, yet still they suffers from the use of hygroscopic dopants, which is seen as a tradeoff between the efficiency and stability of a device. It is very challenging to develop novel HTMs by integrating all the desirable properties, such as (i) low cost and easily processable, (ii) suitable HOMO level alignment with the valence band maximum of the perovskite, (iii) glass transition temperature above 100 °C, (iv) high thermal and photochemical stability, (v) dopant-free, (vi) perovskite surface trap passivation, and (vii) should not involve unwanted chemical interaction with perovskite layer and top electrode (Au or Ag) in one molecule. A better understanding of perovskite/HTM and HTM/electrode interface chemistry could also provide some deep insights into designing novel molecular architectures to achieve efficient and stable device performance. In the direction of developing dopant-free HTMS, designing molecular architecture with better π−π* stacking to increase its charge mobility or integrating dopant chemical structures into HTM would be a viable path. Still there remain incentives to develop cost-effective and dopant-free novel spiro-linked organic small molecules as HTMs for PSCs. We believe that this review will encourage further research on the rational design and synthesis of novel spiro-linked organic small molecule HTMs for PSCs with low synthetic cost, and better performance and stability.
