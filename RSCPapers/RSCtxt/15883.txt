The bottom region of the TiO2 nanotubes with a high concentration of Pd because of the high electric field which was induced to be p-type. In contrast, the region with a low Pd concentration (top of the TiO2 nanotubes) was determined to be n-type, similar to the pristine TiO2. The concentration profile of the dopant in TiO2 nanotubes was investigated via TOF-SIMS and XPS. Defect formation energies in TiO2 nanotubes were estimated using density-functional theory calculation to understand the p–n junction formation. The p–n junction TiO2 nanotubes showed a high photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 25.2 μL cm−2 h−1 under solar light irradiation as a result of the enhancement of visible light photoactivity.
1. Introduction
In the past few decades, the interest in TiO2 nanostructures has drastically increased owing to their wide range of functionality and their uses in various applications, such as solar energy conversion systems,1,2 photocatalysis,2–6 ion-insertion batteries,7 and sensing devices.8 Among these applications, since the first report by Fujishima and Honda in 1972, their use in electrodes in photocatalytic hydrogen production has been the most intensively investigated since the n-type properties of TiO2 endow it with a slightly higher conduction band than the reduction potential of hydrogen in H2O.9–12 However, its wide band gap energy (more than 3 eV) allows the absorption of a limited solar spectrum, particularly in the ultraviolet (UV) range. In order to overcome this drawback, heterojunction formations have been considered by tuning the band alignments, such as in type I,13 type II,14,15 and p–n junction systems.16–18 In particular, the p–n heterojunction affords a significant improvement in the charge collection and separation efficiency with the structure.2,19 The feasibility of formation of p-type TiO2 thin films has been reported through doping of metal or metal ions (Pd, Al, Ni, Cr, etc.) into the lattice.20
Considering that the space charge region or depletion region results from the combination of electrons and holes at the interface of the p–n heterojunction, the formation of a gradient of concentration between the interface and bulk simultaneously results in the diffusion of electrons and holes. Therefore, it promotes and guides the photogenerated electrons and holes to transfer in the opposite direction. As a result, charge separation efficiency is enhanced, charge transfer becomes rapid, and recombination time is decreased,21 thereby leading to higher photocatalytic activity under UV and visible light irradiation with the formation of the photocatalyst in the p–n junction.
Other key parameters for enhancing photocatalytic activity are the large surface area and optimized geometry of TiO2.10,22 In this context, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures have been regarded as promising structures with higher light absorption, fast charge transport, and slow recombination.10,23,24 The most straightforward approach to produce 1D nanostructures with high aspect ratios and perpendicular alignment of TiO2 is the anodization of the Ti metal substrate.23–26 Because of the anodic reaction of Ti metal, highly aligned TiO2 nanotubes can be produced. The advantages of anodically formed TiO2 nanotubes includes not only ease of geometry control with the selection of suitable anodization parameters but also the realization of binder-free electrodes. With regard to the amount of photocatalytic H2 produced, another well-established fact is that noble metal nanoparticles (e.g., Pt, Au, and Ag) act efficiently as cocatalysts on TiO2 nanotubes.27,28 There are two main beneficial effects ascribed to noble decoration, i.e., the effect on surface band bending between the TiO2 semiconductor and the metal contact (the so-called Fermi level pinning), which leads to fast separation of electron/hole pairs, and the classic effect as a hydrogen recombination catalyst that aids H2 formation from reduced atomic hydrogen. Several approaches have been suggested, such as photodeposition,29 impregnation,30 physical mixing,31 and anodization of TiAu or TiPt alloys to modify TiO2 surfaces with noble metal cocatalysts.32–36 In contrast, the partial reduction of TiO2 nanostructures (so-called black titania) has likewise been suggested as another approach to enhance photocatalytic H2 production.37 In view of the formation of the p–n junction with TiO2 nanotubes, the deposition of p-type materials onto or into nanotube structures, p-type nanoparticle decoration or the cladding of the tube wall have also been studied.38 However, such approaches involve intrinsic obstacles, e.g., nonuniformity, intricate process, and band alignment mismatching.
In this study, facile and straightforward vertically aligned p–n junction formation was introduced, which could be achieved through doping electrochemical Pd species into TiO2 nanotubes. It was determined that the area of the p region can be controlled with the applied potential during the Pd species-doping process. The optimized p–n junction TiO2 nanotube configuration afforded a drastic improvement in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under solar light conditions.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of samples
In order to achieve a 1D structured TiO2 nanotube array, Ti metals were anodized in 3 wt% hydrofluoric acid (HF) containing a 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH)/1 M phosphoric acid (H3PO4) electrolyte at 20 V for 4 h. The prepared samples were washed with deionized water, and the excess water was removed using a N2 gas flow as soon as they were dried at 70 °C in an oven. After cleaning and drying, samples were heat treated at 450 °C for 1.5 h in a furnace to realize the crystalline phase of the TiO2 nanotube array. This was labeled TiO2 nanotubes (NTs). However, another procedure was necessary to obtain TiO2 NTs with and without an internal p–n junction. Pd species in the form of a 2 mM potassium hexachloropalladate (K2PdCl6, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) electrolyte were introduced for 10 s into the formed anodic TiO2 nanotube array using electric field bias under the conditions shown in Table 1. Thereafter, cleaning, drying, and heat treatment were conducted with similar conditions to bare TiO2 nanotubes. In addition, the Pd-doped TiO2 NT samples were labeled XX V, which originated from the additional voltage.

2.2 Characterization
Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S-4300SE, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) was conducted to investigate the morphologies of the samples. To crystallize the nanotube array to form anatase, the samples were annealed at 450 °C for 1.5 h; thereafter, high-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert Pro MRD, EA, PANalytical, Netherlands) was used for the determination of the crystalline structure. Subsequently, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS, TOF-SIMS 5, IONTOF GmbH, Münster, Germany) was performed to effectively analyze the distribution of the Pd species in detail. In order to determine the concentration of Pd, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ELAN 6100, PerkinElmer, MA, USA) was employed.
To investigate the photocatalytic H2 production performance of the vertical p–n junction TiO2 nanotube array, the samples were immersed in a quartz tube filled with a mixture of 20 vol% methanol (CH3OH, ACS reagent, ≥99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) and deionized water solution. The quartz tube reactor was purged with high purity nitrogen gas for 30 min to eliminate oxygen. For sunlight irradiation, a solar simulator (LCS-100, ORIEL INSTRUMENTS) with a 100 W Xenon arc lamp was used with an intensity of 1 sun (100 mW cm−2). Photocatalytic experiments were conducted at room temperature in ambient air. 200 μL gas was obtained from the quartz tube and injected into a gas chromatography instrument (GC, Agilent 6850, Agilent technologies) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) to examine the evolved hydrogen gas production. All photocatalytic experiments for all the samples were performed under irradiation for 10 h.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha, ThermoFisher Scientific, OR, USA) was conducted to determine the state of the Pd and valence band edge. To measure the valence edge, the XPS spectrum was obtained at the specific region where there is a range of low binding energy (∼40 eV). The incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was evaluated from the photoelectrochemical spectra. The photoelectrochemical spectra were obtained in 0.1 M sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, ACS reagent, ≥99.0%, anhydrous powder, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) using a monochromatized Xe lamp. The photoelectrochemical spectra were recorded at a constant potential of 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, SP-150, Bio-Logic, Seyssinet-Pariset, France) while the wavelength was varied using a monochromator (MonoRa200, DONGWOO OPTRON, South Korea), and the light intensity of the wavelength was measured with a power sensor (S120VC, THORLABS, NJ, USA).
2.3 Calculation methods
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed within the generalized gradient approximation of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) parameterization,39,40 and VASP software was used. Atomic nuclei and core electrons were described using a projector-augmented wave.41,42 Kohn–Sham orbitals were expanded with a cutoff energy of 400 eV, and 2 × 2 × 2 and 4 × 4 × 4 k-point grids were used for the Brillouin zone sampling in structural relaxation and electronic structure calculations, respectively.43 With regard to the modeling of defects and Pd and Cl doping, a supercell of anatase consisting of a 3 × 3 × 1 replication of a unit cell was used. A Hubbard U approximation (U3d = 4 eV) term was included for the 3d-orbital of Ti.44 The calculated band gaps of anatase TiO2, using PBE and PBE+U, were 2.12 and 2.91 eV, respectively. However, considering that the Hubbard U did not fully correct the band gap (the experimental value was 3.2 eV) and the transition point of the defect charge, the transition point of the defect charge was extrapolated using the following equation:45 (1)with (2)where ε(q/q′) is the transition point from charge q to q′; Eexpg, EPBE+Ug, and EPBEg are the band gap energies obtained from the experiment and the PBE+U and PBE calculations. A hybrid functional (HSE06) was used in the electronic structure and band gap calculations, with the structures optimized by using PBE.46 In the HSE06 calculations, standard parameters, α = 0.25 and ω = 0.20, were used, which were appropriate for the correction of band gaps of common semiconductors.47
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphological characterization
Ti metals were anodized in 3 wt% HF containing a 1 M NaOH/1 M H3PO4 electrolyte at 20 V to achieve vertically and internally aligned p–n junctions of TiO2 nanotubes.48 Thereafter, Pd species were introduced into the formed anodic TiO2 nanotubes by additional electric field bias in the range of 20 to 180 V in 0.002 M K2PdCl6 electrolyte (see Scheme 1 and Fig. 1; for more details, see the ESI†). Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the cross-sectional SEM images of the pristine and Pd species-doped anodic TiO2 nanotubes. In both cases, ordered oxide nanotube layers were obtained with a thickness of approximately 1 μm and individual outer diameters of approximately 130 nm. However, the inner diameters were slightly shrunken and some oxide layers were broken (Fig. 1(b), (c) and S1†). This is because the chloride ion in the dopant precursor slightly leads to a rapid breakdown anodization owing to its high etching properties.49 Although some breakdown events occurred, the well-ordered nanotube structures were maintained at approximately 1 μm in length (Fig. 1(b) and (d)).

In order to crystallize the tube layers, the samples were annealed and characterized by XRD (Fig. 2(a)). The XRD spectra for all cases showed the conversion to anatase with small amounts of rutile. Any crystalline Pd-involved peaks were not only unobservable but also shifted. In simple words, XRD patterns were not able to clearly exhibit differences between undoped and Pd-doped TiO2 with various additional voltages, thereby showing an increase in intensity in some cases of the crystal phases, such as the anatase and rutile phase represented by the filled circle and filled diamond shape, respectively. In addition, the empty circle refers to the Ti metal phase. In general, if the heteroatom is doped in the crystalline structure, the XRD diffraction pattern is slightly shifted because of the distortion of, for example, the bonding structure and distance. In order to identify the character of the doped Pd species into the TiO2 nanotube layers, XPS analysis was conducted (Fig. 2(b)). In the high-resolution spectrum, typical Pd3d doublets manifested with binding energy levels of 342.4–342.8 eV (3d3/2) and 337.0–337.4 eV (3d5/2), corresponding to PdO.50–52 From the chemical analysis, PdO was doped into TiO2 nanotubes with additional applied potential. It was inferred that the anodic reaction leads to PdCl62− decomposition (eqn (3) and (4)) and the incorporation in the TiO2 nanotubes (eqn (5) and (6)). A similar reaction has been reported in the literature.53 The reaction of Pd incorporation into the TiO2 nanotubes is described in this section.

Thereafter, Pd species are oxidized by the anodic potential, thereby resulting in the following reaction: Pd + Ti4+ − O − Ti4+ → Ti3+ − □ − Ti3+ + PdO(5)
However, high anodic voltage also brings about the oxidation of Ti3+ − □ − Ti3+ networks: Ti3+ − □ − Ti3+ + O2− → Ti4+ − O − Ti4+ (TiO2 networks)(6)
Interestingly, by increasing the additional potential during the doping process of the Pd species, oscillation of the Pd3d doublet and a decrease in peak intensity were observed (Fig. 2(b)). This is a result of the decreasing number of collected photons from palladium species. It was inferred that the Pd species are drawn down to the innermost part of the TiO2 nanotubes because of the higher electric field, which leads to changes in the concentration profile of the dopant and weak XPS signals at a higher additional potential.
Depth profile measurements were conducted from the bottom to the top of the doped TiO2 nanotubes via TOF-SIMS (Fig. 3(a), (b), S2, and S3†) to confirm the different concentration profiles with the applied potential. From the results, the Pd species were detected closer to the bottom of the TiO2 nanotubes with an increasing applied potential. It was also demonstrated that Pd species were vertically doped along the TiO2 nanotubes, with the higher concentration of Pd in the bottom region. Moreover, it was recognized that the doping approach led to a heterojunction structure.

3.2 Theoretical calculation
The supercell model of the anatase phase TiO2 structure was designed, as shown in Fig. S4,† and consists of 108 atoms (36 of Ti and 72 of O) and approximately a 1.95 Å bond length (Ti–O, in the case of the anatase phase), to investigate the physical origin of the reduced band gap and highly enhanced photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanotubes. Based on the supercell model of anatase TiO2, the defect formation energies in anatase TiO2 were calculated, considering the existing Pd and Cl impurities. The reservoirs of Pd and Cl dopants were assumed to be PdO(s) and Cl2(g), respectively. It is notable that anatase TiO2 became n-type under atmospheric pressure (PO2 = 0.21 atm) at ambient condition, given that the Fermi energy was pinned at εF =1.77 eV, as a negative Pd dopant at the Ti site (PdTi2−) was compensated with a positively charged oxygen vacancy (VO2+) (Fig. 4(a) and (b)). Since the Fermi level is above the band gap center, the voltage-free region of the TiO2 nanotube is expected to be a typical light n-type semiconductor and the doped Pd concentration is expected to be very low (e.g., approximately 1014 atoms per cm3). Under sufficient reverse bias applied to the Ti electrode side, the Fermi energy level is lowered and, consequently, a larger band bending on the TiO2 side is induced at the interface between Ti and TiO2. When the Ti electrode is anodized to grow anatase TiO2 nanotubes, the doping of the Pd atoms in the Ti site can be stabilized due to the negative charge of the doped Pd (PdTi2−) and the Fermi level is expected to be pinned. The concentration of Pd in the TiO2 p-type region is expected to be much higher than that in the SIMS profile of the TiO2 nanotube samples grown with high voltages of 180 V, approximately 0.3 at% concentration of Pd in TiO2 matrices. Thereafter, TiO2 nanotubes can become p-type by having the Fermi level near the valence band maximum (VBM) (in theory, 0.13 eV above the VBM). Ideally, the photocatalytic water splitting performance of a semiconductor nanostructure is maximized when the built-in potential is induced over the whole volume via space charge. The depletion region width, WD, can be expressed using the following general equation: (7)where ε, q, ND, and Øbi represent the dielectric constant of TiO2, charge magnitude of an electron (hole), concentration of space charge, and the built-in potential, respectively. V in eqn (7) pertains to the bias applied to the Ti electrode side. Considering that an anodizing bias is consistent with a reverse bias in the Ti/TiO2 ohmic junction, V is negative for TiO2 nanotube growth. Thereafter, the WD at the Ti/TiO2 interface is increased with the square root of the bias. Assuming that most of the Pd dopants are within the WD, the ND is approximately 1020 cm−3 at room temperature (Fig. S5†). The formation mechanism of p-type TiO2 nanotubes by metal ion doping will be in-line with the literature.54 In addition, the band gap energy of the Pd-doped TiO2 nanotubes was calculated and obtained to be 2.6 eV as shown in Fig. 4(c).

(b) The doping and defect formation energies at the representative chemical potentials of Cl and O for facile Cl doping. (c) Calculated electron density of states of PdTi2−, which were theoretically predicted to narrow the band gap of anatase TiO2 from 3.2 to 2.6 eV. 
As a result, based on the empirical and theoretical studies, band alignment can be suggested. The band gap energy of the Pd-doped TiO2 nanotubes was 2.6 eV, which was obtained using the calculation shown in Fig. 4(c). In addition, n-type TiO2 generally shows a band gap energy of 3.1 to 3.2 eV. Through XPS analysis, the valence band position of the p-type region of Pd-doped TiO2 was also able to be estimated, and it was approximately 0.4 eV, while that of the n-type region was approximately 2.8 eV (Fig. S6†). Overall, the enhancement of photocatalytic H2 production with the high electric field Pd species doped p–n junction TiO2 nanotube array can be described as a scheme of the band diagram (Fig. 5).

3.3 Photocatalytic water splitting performance
In order to confirm visible light absorption of the p–n junction TiO2 nanotubes, the incident photo to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out using the photocurrent spectra, as shown in Fig. 6(a). The following equation was used to calculate the IPCE, (8)where Jph is the photocurrent density, P is the input power intensity, and λ is the wavelength of the incident photon.
 Fig. 6  (a) IPCE plots of the samples. (b) Photocatalytic H2 production rate. The amount of produced H2 was measured by GC. 
The p–n junction TiO2 nanotubes clearly showed visible light absorption even when the IPCE in the UV range was lower than that of the pristine TiO2 nanotubes. This is because of the additional compact oxide formed between the TiO2 nanotube structures and metal substrate,24,55 as a result of the additionally applied potential to introduce Pd species into TiO2 nanotubes.56 The compact oxide layers acted as a resistor in the electrochemical system.57,58
In order to investigate the photocatalytic activity of the vertical p–n heterojunction TiO2 nanotubes in relation to H2 production from methanol solutions, various samples were investigated under open circuit conditions using simulated solar light (AM 1.5 solar simulator, 100 mW cm−2) for 10 h, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The produced H2 amounts were measured via GC, detecting that the hydrogen production rate was continuously increased at 0.1 μL cm−2 h−1 V−1 until 180 V. The hydrogen production rate was 25.2 μL cm−2 h−1 at 180 V. Over 180 V, the hydrogen production rate was almost saturated; hence, there was no additional beneficial effect. The maximum hydrogen production rate was 27.9 μL cm−2 h−1 at 260 V which is approximately 250 times higher than that of the pristine TiO2 nanotubes. This result is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest hydrogen production rate in the field of photocatalysis with novel metal-decorated anodic TiO2 nanotubes.14,18,27,28,32,33 The tendency of hydrogen production rate enhancement is consistent with our calculation in Fig. 4(a) and the depth profiling of TOF-SIMS in Fig. 3(a), (b), and S3.† In order to confirm the effect of the total amount of the dopant, measurements using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were conducted (Fig. S7†). The results indicated that the total amount of Pd in all doped nanotubes was approximately the same with an average of 0.0075 mg. This result demonstrated that the enhancement of photocatalytic activity is only contributed by the tuned p–n junction formation.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the feasibility of the direct formation of vertically aligned p–n junction anodic TiO2 nanotubes by electrochemical Pd doping into the structures was demonstrated. Using DFT calculations and XPS analysis, it was found that Pd-doped TiO2 nanotubes became p-type only under a strong electric field. Based on the empirical and theoretical studies, concentration distribution of the Pd dopant in the structures and junction can be controlled via the applied potential. Vertically formed p–n junction TiO2 nanotubes exhibited high photocatalytic hydrogen production. With optimum junction structures, the hydrogen production rate was determined to be capable of being enhanced by more than 250 times compared to that of the pristine n-type TiO2 nanotubes. The enhancement is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest compared to those of other modifications of TiO2 nanotubes (e.g., cocatalyst modification).
