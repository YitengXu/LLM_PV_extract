    , Accepted 28th January 2013First published on 29th January 2013AbstractIn an organic-based solar cell, the short exciton diffusion length of organic materials requires effective donor–acceptor heterojunction at the nanoscale. In this work, hybrid inorganic/polymer solar cells based on ZnO nanostructures and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) are constructed to study the effects of ZnO morphologies and wettability of the surface on the P3HT infiltration ability and charge transport mechanisms. The P3HT infiltrates the ZnO nanorod (NR) more remarkably than ZnO nanoparticle (NP) substrates. Although surface modification with indoline D205 dye molecules improves the wettability (viz. enlarges the contact angle) of NP surface, the P3HT infiltration distance decreases in comparison with the pristine NP case. This leads to relatively low short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the NP devices in comparison with that of the NR devices, even though the surface area of NP layers is larger than that of NR ones. Moreover, surface modification with squaraine dye onto the NR surface shows more significant improvement in Jsc than the NP case. This is due to the well-aligned morphology of the NRs, which facilitates dye modification, P3HT infiltration, and charge transport processes. These indicate that the NRs are more qualified as electron accepting substrates and transport pathway in hybrid solar cells than NPs.
1. Introduction
In recent years, hybrid photovoltaic devices (HPVs) have been widely studied because of their fundamental research interest and application potential. Organic p-type donor polymers and inorganic materials such as n-type acceptor of nanostructured metal oxides are used to construct a HPV.1–3 Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is the most widely used donor since it provides relatively high hole mobility and it is solution-processable material.4 For an electron acceptor, ZnO is a good candidate due to its high electron mobility with a reduction of charge recombination when ZnO is used in photovoltaic devices.5,6 Moreover, ZnO has a great variety of different morphologies which can be synthesized using a wide range of methodologies at low temperature.1,7–9
HPVs have been constructed by using various morphologies of ZnO such as nanorods (NRs),2,10 nanofibers (NFs),6 nanoparticles (NPs),11 and so on. The morphologies of nanostructured ZnO have been found to be mainly related to the performances of the subsequence devices in terms of charge separation at the ZnO/polymer interface and charge collection mechanisms. Vertically-aligned ZnO NRs are one of the promising substrates for enhancement in the charge collection since they provide a direct electron-transport pathway to the electrode without charge recombination at the grain boundary.1,12–15 However, the interface area of the hybrid ZnO NR devices, is relatively low in comparison to that of hybrid ZnO NP devices.
In hybrid ZnO NP/P3HT devices, NPs with a very small size have been used in order to obtain a large area of the interface and a small pore size of less than 10 nm.11 This requirement is based on the fact that excitons in P3HT, which have a diffusion length of only 10 nm,16 have to reach the ZnO/P3HT interface before recombining.11,17 Although, the requirement can be obtained by using very small size NPs, the infiltration of P3HT is subsequently limited due to the small pore size. One of the promising approaches to overcome this limitation is to modify the surface of ZnO NPs with regard to the improvement of affinity between the ZnO surface and the P3HT.
In our previous report,18 the effects of surface modification with small molecular organic dyes onto the ZnO NR surface was shown in terms of the chemical and photophysical properties of the dyes and the device performances. We found that the dipole moment and light absorption range of the dyes are significant for charge generation and charge injection at the ZnO surface. However, in the ZnO NP devices, the effects of surface modification in relation with device configuration, charge transport, and photovoltaic properties have not yet been reported.
In this work, we compare the effect of the surface modification onto the ZnO NRs and ZnO NPs in order to understand the influence of the nanostructure morphologies on the device mechanisms. Indoline D205 dye (Fig. 1a) and squaraine (Sq) (Fig. 1b) dye are selected as representatives of molecules with dipole pointing away and toward the ZnO surface, respectively. It was found that the dye modification onto the ZnO NR surface has significant impact on the device performance as compared to the dye modification onto the ZnO NP surface. The device mechanisms are discussed in terms of the polymer infiltration behavior, interface area, energy band alignment, charge generation and charge transport through the ZnO nanostructures.

2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of ZnO nanorod substrates
The synthesis of ZnO nanorods was patterned after the method described in previously reported procedures.18 The ZnO seed layers were prepared on ITO substrates by spin coating using a mixture of Zn acetate (0.3 M) and monoethanolamine (0.3 M) in 2-methoxyethanol. Then, the substrates were annealed on a hot plate at 300 °C for 10 min. The hydrothermal growth of ZnO nanorod arrays was performed by suspending the as-prepared seed ZnO substrate in an aqueous solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine at 90 °C, yielding the nanorod length as approximately 240 nm. The substrate was carefully rinsed with distilled water and finally annealed at 150 °C for 10 min.
2.2. Preparation of ZnO nanoparticle substrates
ZnO nanoparticles (diameter of about 4–5 nm) were synthesized and purified following the reported procedures.19–21 A 2.95 g portion of zinc acetate dihydrate was dissolved in 120 mL of methanol. A 1.48 g portion of KOH was dissolved in 60 mL of methanol. The KOH solution was dropped into the zinc acetate dihydrate solution in 10 min under vigorous stirring. The solution temperature was held at 60 °C for 135 min. Hexane and isopropanol were added into the ZnO–methanol colloids with a volume ratio of hexane: the ZnO–methanol colloids:isopropanol = 3:1:1. The ZnO nanoparticles precipitated after keeping in a refrigerator for 1 h. After centrifugation, the ZnO precipitate was dispersed in chloroform by hand-shaking. A solution of poly(ethylene glocol) (PEG) was then added to the suspension with a volume ratio of 5:1 (ZnO:PEG). The mixture was spin coated onto the ZnO seed layer, resulting in a film of ca. 55 nm thickness. The as-prepared film was annealed at 300 °C for 10 min.
2.3. Surface modification with dyes
The ZnO nanorod and ZnO nanoparticle substrates were immersed in solutions of D205 and squaraine (Sq) dyes in a concentration of 0.3 mM in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butanol (1:1 v/v) at 60 °C for 1 h. The synthesis of the squaraine dye was described in previously reported literature.18 The substrates were rinsed with acetonitrile before fabricating the solar cells.
2.4. Fabrication of hybrid ZnO/P3HT solar cells
A solution of P3HT in chlorobenzene (30 mg ml−1, for nanorod devices, 18 mg ml−1 for nanoparticle devices) was spin-coated on top of dye-modified ZnO nanorods. The total thickness of the active layer (NR or NP, P3HT) is about 410 nm and 130 nm for NR devices and NP devices, respectively. Subsequently, the films were annealed at 150 °C in an N2-filled glove box for 3 min. Finally, the VOx (5 nm) and Ag top electrode (100 nm) was thermally evaporated in the vacuum evaporation system.
2.5. Characterization
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to investigate the morphologies of ZnO NPs and ZnO NRs. X-Ray diffraction spectrometry was performed to analyze the crystalinities of ZnO NRs and ZnO NPs. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was carried out to study the element distribution in the active layer. Photo-electron yield spectrometer (PYS) was carried out using PYS-201 (Sumitomo Advanced Machinery) for ZnO and AC-3 (Riken-Keiki) for P3HT to measure the valence band edge (VBE) of the nanostructured ZnO and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of P3HT. The photocurrent–voltage characteristics were measured under ambient atmosphere and simulated solar light, AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 on CEP-2000 (Bunkoh-Keiki). A photo mask with an area of 0.05 cm2 was used to define the active area of the device irradiated by light. Absorptions spectra were obtained from a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2450 Shimadzu).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Infiltration of P3HT

Fig. 1c–d shows the morphologies of the ZnO nanorods growing vertically from the plane of ITO substrate. Their diameters are measured to be about 25 nm with the rod-to-rod space in a range of less than 10 nm to 80 nm. On the other hand, the ZnO NPs have diameters of about 4–5 nm as confirmed by the TEM image in Fig. 1e. When the NPs are coated on an ITO substrate, the NPs form in clusters with a size of about 30 nm as seen in the AFM image (Fig. 1f and section 1 in the ESI†). The pore size is in the range of a few nanometers to a maximum of 55 nm, which is relatively smaller than the rod-to-rod space of NRs substrate.
The P3HT infiltration into the NRs substrates with and without surface modification was observed by SEM and the images are shown in Fig. 2a–c. It is seen that the NRs substrates with and without surface modification have a complete coverage of the gaps between the NRs by P3HT since the rod-to-rod space is relatively large. Moreover, modification with D205 dye improves the wettability of the surface as seen from the increase in the contact angle of the water droplet (inset of Fig. 2, Table 1). This is attributed to the interaction between the terminal of dye molecules and water molecules. Since dye molecules generally attach to the ZnO surfaces by their carboxylic or carboxylate group,18 D205 molecules face the non-polar terminal groups to water, leading to hydrophobic behavior with a high contact angle of 130.8°. The D205 modification simplifies the P3HT infiltration into the space because the P3HT also shows the same behavior with a contact angle of 104.5°. For the Sq-modified NR substrate, although the contact angle is lower than that of the D205-modified NR surface, showing less hydrophobic behavior than the D205-modified NR substrate, the infiltration of P3HT is still qualified as confirmed by EFTEM images in Fig. 3.

For the P3HT infiltration in the pore of NP layer, FE-SEM cannot be performed properly since the pore size is relatively small. Therefore, EDS point analysis was carried out to measure an atomic percentage of C, O, S, and Zn elements at various distances from the NP surface randomly (section 2 in the ESI†). In order to observe how far P3HT are able to infiltrate the layer, 300–350 nm-thick NP substrates with and without surface modification (Fig. 2d–f) were prepared. The relative S atom is comparatively lower than the other elements, since the ratio of S/C in P3HT monomer is only 1/10. Therefore, the relative C atom is chosen to represent the amount of P3HT. The C/Zn ratios of NP layer with and without dye modification are interpolated (section 2 in the ESI†) and plotted versus the distance from the NP surface as shown in Fig. 4a. It was found that the C/Zn ratio of the pure NP sample is almost constant at ∼1, implying that some residuals (chloroform and PEG) during the preparation of the film are still remaining, even though the sample was annealed at 300 °C. However, the C/Zn ratio of the NP/P3HT sample is relatively higher than the pristine NP sample, indicating that P3HT is able to infiltrate the pores.
 Fig. 4  (a) Plot of C/Zn ratio for the NP substrate with and without dye modification before and after the P3HT deposition as a function of the distance from the NP surface. The subtracted C/Zn ratio is plotted in (b). 
The infiltration distance of P3HT and dyes is evaluated by subtracting the C/Zn ratios of the samples with P3HT or dyes from ones without P3HT or dyes. The subtracted value is plotted in Fig. 4b and thresholds of the curves refer to the infiltration distances. It is clear that the infiltration abilities of D205 and Sq are comparable, while one of the P3HT relates to dye properties. The infiltration distance of P3HT on the pristine NR substrate is about 120 nm, while it decreases to 80 nm and 25 nm for the D205- and Sq-modified NP substrates, respectively. Although the contact angle of the D205-modified NP substrate is 98.7°, which implies a good interaction between D205 molecules and P3HT, the infiltration ability of P3HT is not enhanced. This is because the voided space is partially fulfilled by D205 molecules, blocking the P3HT to infiltrate into the voids. For the Sq-modified NP substrate, the contact angle decreases to 82.4°, showing less hydrophobicity than the others. Relatively short infiltration distance presumably ascribes to the less hydrophobicity. In this context P3HT may prefer to infiltrate the accessible inter-rod space of ZnO NR substrate rather than the voids of ZnO NP substrate.
3.2. Surface and interface area
UV-visible absorption spectra of the NR and NP substrates with and without dye modification were collected to compare the surface area between the NRs and NPs. In Fig. 5, the absorbance of dyes adsorbed onto the NP surface is relatively higher than that of the dye-modified NR surface. This result also implies that the dye molecules are able to infiltrate into the voids of NPs as compared to the case of the inter-rod space of NRs, corresponding to the EDS results as we mentioned above in Section 3.1. Moreover, the surface area of NPs is confirmed to be relatively larger than that of NRs, though the data have not been shown. However, the surface area of NPs is not equivalent to ZnO/P3HT interface area because of limitation of the P3HT infiltration. Especially, in the case of the dye-modified NP layer, the P3HT infiltration is relatively poor. This limitation will lead to a non-workable surface area of the hybrid cell (as discussed below).

3.3. Photovoltaic performance
Hybrid ZnO/P3HT solar cells using the NR and NP substrates at various thicknesses were fabricated and characterized (section 3 in the ESI†). The optimum conditions for pristine NR and NP devices are obtained by using NRs with a length of 240 nm and NPs with a thickness of 55 nm (Fig. S4 and S5 in the ESI†). The conditions were selected and used for the surface modification with dye molecules. The photovoltaic characteristics are shown in Table 2. It is seen that the PCE of the pristine NR device (0.259%) was slightly higher than that of the pristine NP device (0.205%). Modification with D205 dye improved open-circuit voltage (Voc) for both of the ZnO NRs and the ZnO NP devices from their corresponding unmodified ones. This is due to the shift of band energy alignment between ZnO and P3HT from the dipole moment of the D205 dye (pointing away from the ZnO surface) as previously described.18,22 The effect can be seen clearly in the case of D205-modified ZnO NP device. That is, the Voc increased significantly to 0.761 V, which is higher than that of the pristine ZnO NP one (0.437 V).

In order to investigate the difference between the Voc of NRs and that of NPs, electronic band structure of the ZnO nanostructures and P3HT were measured. The experimental values (section 4 in the ESI†) are summarized in Fig. 6. The energy gap of NPs (3.35 eV) is slightly wider than that of NRs (3.30 eV) since the crystal size of NPs is relatively small. Moreover, the conduction band edge (CBE) of the NPs pins more negative than the CBE of NRs. Therefore, the offset between the CBE of ZnO and the HOMO of P3HT, which is directly related to the maximum Voc of the system,23 of the NPs/P3HT device (0.66 eV) is larger than that of the NRs/P3HT one (0.50 eV). This corresponds to the Voc of NP device, which is higher than that of the NP one in each case.

On the other hand, the short circuit current density (Jsc) of the NR device shows improvement with the surface modification with dyes. Especially, the Jsc of the Sq-modified NR device increases to 5.52 mA cm−2 from 1.42 mA cm−2 of the unmodified NR one. However, the improvement in Jsc was not significant in the case of the NP device. The modification with D205 dye on the NP device shows an opposite effect to that on the NR one. The Jsc of the device decreases to 0.45 mA cm−2 from 1.10 mA cm−2 of the unmodified NP one.
An incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) measurement was performed to confirm the light-harvesting properties of the devices and explain the change in Jsc. The IPCE spectra are shown in Fig. 7. For the unmodified devices, the IPCE peaks in the UV region and visible region are attributed to the photogenerated charge carrier of ZnO and P3HT, respectively.24 It can be seen that the IPCEs of the dye-modified and unmodified NR devices are relatively high in comparison with those of the NP devices. This is due to the poor P3HT infiltration onto the dye-modified NP layers as described above, although the surface area of the thin NP layer is larger than that of the thick NR one. This attributes to the formation of non-workable ZnO/dye/air interface at the voids of NPs. Excitons generated through the light absorption of the dye are unable to separate perfectly into free charge carriers, if there is no hole transporting layer at the ZnO/dye/air interface. Terminated transport of free electrons and holes at the voids of NPs also results in the recombination and wasting the photon energy.
 Fig. 7  IPCE spectra of the devices with NRs and NPs before and after modification with D205 and Sq dyes. 
With the D205 modification, the IPCE spectra of the modified NR device show enhancement of the peak in the visible region and an additional peak (∼400 nm) resulting from the light absorption of D205.18 Conversely, there is no enhancement and any additional peak in the case of D205-modified NP device. Although the P3HT infiltrates the D205-modified NP layer down to the NPs/ITO interface (infiltration distance is ∼80 nm as shown in Fig. 4b, while the optimum thickness of the NP layer is ∼55 nm), the formation of non-workable ZnO/D205/air interface is found. This is reflected by the lower C/Zn curve of P3HT in D205-modified NP sample in comparison with that of the P3HT in a pristine NP sample. In addition, it is possible that the upward shifted CBE of the NPs due to the dipole moment of the D205 dye decreases the density of accessible acceptor states which electrons from the D205 dye can occupy.25 Moreover, the NPs have a crystal size of 5 nm smaller than 36 nm of the NRs, which are evaluated26 from the XRD patterns as shown in Fig. 8. Since the density of states (DOS) is proportional to the number of basic crystal structures,27 the DOS in the conduction band of the NPs might be relatively low in comparison to that of the NRs. Lower DOS presumably brought in no charge injection from D205 dye to the NPs but not in the case of the NRs.
 Fig. 8  XRD patterns of NRs and NPs. 
For the surface modification with Sq dye, the extended IPCE spectra to the near IR region are observed in both cases (Fig. 7). This is due to the light absorption of Sq dye as described in our previous report.18 The improvement in the IPCE peak in the visible region is observed in the case of Sq-modified NR device, but not in the NP case. Although the surface area of NPs is larger than that of NRs, the P3HT infiltration onto the Sq-modified NP layer is limited to ∼25 nm (Fig. 4b), resulting in more non-workable ZnO/Sq/air interface at the voids of NPs than that of ZnO/D205/air. Moreover, if the effective DOS of NPs is relatively low in comparison to that of NRs, there would not be enough available acceptor states for the photogenerated electrons from the Sq and P3HT to be occupied. Formation of non-workable voids of the ZnO/Sq/air interface and low effective DOS of NPs limits the improvement of the IPCE peak in the visible region.
3.4. Charge transport mechanisms
Charge transport mechanisms of the NR and NP devices are summarized in Fig. 9. In hybrid solar cells based on ZnO NRs or ZnO NPs, the inter-rod space and the voids size are needed to be comparable to the exciton diffusion length of P3HT so that photogenerated excitons from P3HT are able to reach the ZnO/dye/P3HT interface for charge separation (Process 1. in Fig. 9). The charge carrier mainly originates from the light absorption of P3HT, which corresponds to the IPCE peak in the visible region. The additional charge generation is also obtained from the light absorption of dye molecules by injecting electrons to conduction band of ZnO and holes to HOMO of P3HT (Process 2). These two processes are limited by the ZnO/dye/P3HT interface area, which is related to the morphologiy of nanostructures and the P3HT infiltration ability. Moreover, the effective DOS of the ZnO nanostructures, which is related to the basic crystal size, is significant for the electron accepting ability. Therefore, increasing the diameter of NPs is one of the promising approaches for the improvement in the PCE of NP devices so that so as to increase the effective DOS and the size of the voids.
 Fig. 9  Charge transport mechanisms in the NR and NP devices: (1) exciton diffusion and separation at ZnO/dye/P3HT interface, (2) photogenerated charge carrier of the dye, (3) recombination at the non-workable ZnO/dye/air interface, (4) charge transport along the nanostructures, (5) trapping or charge recombination at grain boundaries of the NPs. 
However, if P3HT does not infiltrate perfectly the void of the NPs, a non-workable ZnO/dye/air interface occurs. This leads to imperfect exciton separation and charge recombination instead (Process 3). Especially, for the NP layer, the infiltration distance decreases, although, the wettability of the surface is improved by adsorbing D205 dye onto the ZnO surface. Therefore, the size of the voids is more significant than the wettability of the surface.
After the exciton separation process, free electrons transfer along the nanostructures to the electrode (Process 4). In the NR devices, electrons travel directly to the electrode without trapping or recombination at the grain boundaries28,29 like in the case of NP devices (Process 5). The relatively low Jsc of the NP devices is probably due to this phenomenon.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the effect of ZnO morphology with dye modification on the P3HT infiltration and charge transport mechanisms of HPVs based on ZnO and P3HT was investigated. ZnO NRs are more appropriate for electron acceptor substrates than ZnO NPs. This is mainly because the P3HT are able to infiltrate the accessible inter-rod space, leading to homogenous junction interface. In addition, the surface modification with dye molecules in the NR devices show significant effects in terms of charge generation and charge transport. Although the surface area of NPs was relatively larger in comparison to that of the NRs, the Jscs of the NP devices were lower. This is because the P3HT infiltration into the dye-modified NP layer is poor, even the wettability of the NP surface is enhanced. In this context, non-workable ZnO/dye/air interface is formed, where exitons cannot separate properly. However, the NP devices show higher Voc than NR ones, since the CBE of NPs pins more negative than that of the NRs. Higher photovoltaic performance may be obtained for vertically-aligned 1D metal oxide nanostructures that can provide the properties of more negative CBE, high surface area, and high rod density.
