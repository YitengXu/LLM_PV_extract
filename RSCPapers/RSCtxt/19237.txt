    , Accepted 18th May 2020First published on 19th May 2020AbstractTwo families of internally functionalized multifaceted organochalcogen compounds based on flexible and rigid backbones, viz., N,N-dimethylaminoalkyl and pyridyl/pryrimidyl groups, have been designed and developed in the author's group. These compounds exhibit remarkable ligand chemistry and often show unprecedented reactivity leading to the formation of several serendipitous products. The presence of both soft (chalcogen) and hard (nitrogen) donor atoms makes them hemilabile ligands which facilitates the design of palladium based homogeneous catalysts for C–C coupling and other related reactions. Pyridyl and pyrimidyl based chalcogenolato complexes of Group 10–15 metals have been successfully employed as molecular precursors for the preparation of metal chalcogenide nano-crystals and for deposition of thin films. By making a suitable choice of chalcogenolate ligands and reaction conditions, a single phasic material can be isolated conveniently. 2-Pyridyl and 2-pyrimidyl ring systems, being important constituents of several biological molecules, several selenium based 2-pyridyl and 2-pyrimidyl compounds show promising GPx mimicking activity. The substituents at the C-3 position play a key role in governing the molecular structure as well as GPx activity.Vimal K.

Introduction
The chemistry of organochalcogen compounds is making great strides in diverse areas ranging from organic synthesis, ligands in coordination chemistry, materials science and biology, etc.1–4 Such versatility can be realized by a proper design of these compounds. More than a quarter century back when our group was exploring the chemistry of thiolato complexes, two serious problems were encountered, viz., (i) solubility of the products hampering their characterization and (ii) a direct tool to monitor the reactions. Fortunately, both selenium and tellurium possess NMR active isotopes (both I = 1/2; natural abundance: 77Se = 7.63%; 125Te = 7.07%). Their reactions and the compounds can readily be monitored/characterized by 77Se and 125Te NMR spectroscopy. For solubility, a hard donor in addition to the softer chalcogen atom was also desirable so as to introduce hemilability in the system. Accordingly, two families of internally functionalized multifaceted organochalcogen compounds were conceptualized. Initially, compounds based on flexible backbones, viz., N,N-dimethylaminoalkyl, followed by a small-bite rigid framework based on N-heteroaryl groups (pyridyl/pryrimidyl), were developed (Scheme 1).5–7
 Scheme 1 
Diorgano dichalcogenides

N,N-Dimethylaminoalkyl dichalcogenides are conveniently prepared by the reactions of sodium dichalcogenides with an appropriate N,N-dimethylaminoalkyl chloride in organic solvents (Scheme 2).8–12 The reaction of Me2NCH2CH(Me)Cl, however, gives a mixture of [Me2NCH(Me)CH2E]2 (E-1) and [Me2NCH2CH(Me)E]2 (E-2), the relative ratio of which depends on the nucleophilic character of chalcogen atoms.11 The formation of E-2 decreases upon going from S to Se through Te (the ratio of E-1 and E-2 is 1:2 (S), 1:1 (Se) and 5:1 (Te)). A cyclic aziridium (CH-1) species as an intermediate has been found in these reactions. The chalcogenides, [Me2N(CH2)nE]2, display only one set of resonances, but bis(2-dimethylamino)propyl dichalcogenides exhibit two sets of signals in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra. The 77Se NMR spectrum (Fig. 1) displays 8 lines which can be assigned to RR/SS and meso forms of E-1 and E-2. The intra-molecular interactions between Se and N may lead to a magnetic non-equivalence of Se atoms in each molecule.11

The heavier analogue of 2-mercaptopyridine, viz selenide/telluride, remained elusive for a long time possibly due to the absence of convenient synthetic methods. Mautner et al.13 described the synthesis of 2,2′-dipyridyldiselenide by reacting 2-bromopyridine with H2Se which was generated by the addition of dilute HCl to aluminium selenide. Subsequently efforts were made to develop safe and convenient methods14–16 with improved yields.17,18 Similarly, preparation of the corresponding 2,2′-dipyridylditelluride encountered several difficulties specially with regard to not only low yields but also non-reproducibility of the synthesis.19 Subsequently other methods,20–22 in particular a reaction involving sodium borohydride reduction of tellurium powder in alkaline 2-ethoxyethanol followed by treatment with 2-bromopyridine and areal oxidation,23 have been developed for the synthesis of 2,2′-dipyridyl ditelluride. Later, Bhasin et al., described a convenient high yield synthesis of 2,2′-dipyridyl ditellurides.24 This method involves the treatment of pyridylmagnesium chloride, generated in situ by bromine-magnesium exchange reaction between 2-bromopyridine and PriMgCl in THF, with elemental tellurium followed by areal oxidation.
Several dipyridyl diselenides/ditellurides have been structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses.6 The Se–Se and Te–Te distances in these compounds vary in the range of 2.28–2.35 and 2.68–2.72 Å, respectively, while the C–E distances lie at ∼1.92 (C–Se) and ∼2.12 Å (C–Te). The two pyridyl groups can adopt the syn–syn, syn–anti, and anti–anti conformation with respect to the E–E bond in the solid state. There could be weak E⋯N secondary interactions which can influence the C–E–E–C torsion angle and E–E bond distance.
Ligands and reactivity
The reactions of Na2PdCl4 with diorgano dichalcogenides in methanol yield sparingly soluble/insoluble oligomeric complexes of empirical composition [PdCl(E⁀N)]n (1), the structure of which depends on the nature of the E⁀N ligand (Scheme 3). A trimeric structure is formed with alkyl ligands where E and N are separated by two carbon atoms (e.g.8 [PdCl(SeCH2CH2NMe2)]3), whereas a dimeric structure is adopted (e.g., [PdCl(SeCH2CH2CH2NMe2)]2) when E and N are three carbons apart.10,12 In the case of N-heteroaryl ligands, 1 is isolated as an insoluble powder.25,26 The formation of 1 in these reactions is intriguing in terms of the oxidation of dichalcogenide (R2E2) to chalcogenolate ion (RE−), gaining an electron per chalcogen atom, without any isolable reduction product. Having examined the reactivity of numerous dichalcogenides differing in denticity and steric demands, it was proposed that initially dichalcogenide oxidatively adds to Pd2+ to give an unstable Pd4+ species [PdCl2(ER)2] which undergoes reductive elimination of RECl with the concomitant formation of [PdCl(ER)]n.27 Interestingly, the reaction between Na2PdCl4 with (4-pyE)2 in methanol yields a brown insoluble product, [PdCl2{4-py2E2}] (E = Se or Te).28,29 The telluro derivative when treated with two equivalents of PPh3 affords a tellurolato – bridged complex, [Pd2Cl2(μ-TeC5H4N-4)2(PPh3)2], which is formed as a mixture of cis and trans isomers.29
 Scheme 3 
The reactions of Na2PdCl4 with NaE⁀L, prepared in situ by sodium borohydride reduction of dichalcogenides, yield homoleptic chalcogenolate complexes, [Pd(E⁀L)2]n (2) (E⁀L = SeCH2CH2CH2NMe2 or SeCH2CH2COOMe).12,30,31 These complexes comprise a hexagonal cyclo-[PdSe2]6 ring in which two palladium atoms are bridged by two selenolate Se atoms while the L function remains uncoordinated. The hexanuclear complex, [Pd(SeCH2CH2CH2NMe2)2]6, reacts with Na2PdCl4 or [Pd(OAc)2]3 to afford binuclear complexes of the type [PdX(SeCH2CH2CH2NMe2)]2 (X = Cl or OAc) in which two chelating selenolate ligands bridge two palladium atoms. Inter-conversion of dimeric to hexameric complexes can be readily accomplished (Scheme 4).
 Scheme 4 
The chemistry of palladium and platinum chalcogenolato complexes with phosphines as auxiliary ligands has been investigated. Thiolate and selenolate ligands, in general, afforded desired complexes, but the tellurolate, due to a weaker Te–C bond, often resulted in several unprecedented derivatives. Reactions of [M2Cl2(μ-Cl)2(PR3)2] with chalcogenolate ions have been extensively investigated.9,10,25,32–34 The reactions with two equivalents of NaE⁀N yield complexes of general composition, [MCl(E⁀N)(PR3)] (3) (M = Pd or Pt; ECH2CH(R)NMe2 (R = H or Me), 2-pyridyl selenolate/tellurolate) and [MCl(μ-ECH2CH2CH2NMe2)(PR3)]2 (4) (E = Se or Te). The former series of complexes can also be obtained by the treatment of [PdCl(E⁀N)]n with a phosphine ligand. Complexes 3 have a chelating chalcogenolate ligand. The neutral donor atoms (P and N) invariably occupy trans positions. This configuration is retained both in solution (by 31P, 77Se and 195Pt NMR spectroscopy) and in the solid state (by X-ray crystallography). The complexes derived from 2-pyridyl selenolate/tellurolate contain a 4-membered chelate ring whereas compounds from ECH2CHRNMe2 have a five-membered chelate ring that adopts a twist conformation, and when combined with the presence of methyl group substituents, these compounds result in two conformations (CH-2 and CH-3) (Scheme 5).11 Compound 4 derived from the 3-dimethylaminopropyl chalcogenolate adopts a dimeric structure containing a chalcogenolate – bridge and free NMe2 group. These complexes exist in cis and trans configurations.10
 Scheme 5 
The monomeric complexes, [MCl(E⁀N)(PR3)] (3), are distinctly coloured. The colour darkens with increasing the size of the chalcogen atom (Table 1).9 Absorption for platinum complexes appears at higher energies than that of the corresponding palladium derivatives. The origin of the colour is due to a well separated broad but weak band in the visible region. This absorption, also confirmed by TD-DFT calculations, has been attributed to a ligand (E)-to-ligand (PR3) charge transfer (LLCT) transition which is mediated by the metal centre.9

The reactions of [M2Cl2(μ-Cl)2(PR3)2] with NaECH2CH2NMe2/2-pyE− (E = Se or Te) proceed via a binuclear intermediate, [M2Cl3(E⁀N)(PR3)2] (5), which upon further reaction with the chalcogenolate ion affords the desired mononuclear complexes 3. In fact, this intermediate (5) can be conveniently isolated by the reaction of [M2Cl2(μ-Cl)2(PR3)2] with sodium chalcogenolate in a 1:1 ratio (i.e., 2M:1E⁀N).25,33,34 An organoplatinum complex [Pt2Ph2(Cl)(SeCH2CH2NMe2)(PBun3)2] has been isolated and characterized by NMR (31P, 195Pt) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.33 Two distorted square-planar coordinated platinum atoms in the complex are held together by a single chalcogenolate bridge and metal square planes are inclined to each other through the Pt–Se–Pt angle of 111.69(5)°. The chalcogen atom in mononuclear complexes (3) is sufficiently basic and can be used as a donor to coordinate with other metal centres. Thus the mononuclear complexes, [MCl(E⁀N)(PR3)] (3), have been utilized for constructing neutral bi- (e.g., [PtMCl3(ECH2CH2NMe2)(PR3)2] (M = Pd or Pt; E = Se or Te)) and tri-nuclear (e.g. [Pt3Cl4(SeCH2CH2NMe2)(PEt3)2]) derivatives (Fig. 2) (Scheme 6).8,25,34,35 Similarly, [M(ER)2(P⁀P)] reacts with cationic metal centres to yield cationic bi- and tri-nuclear derivatives.36

 Scheme 6 
The reactions of mononuclear palladium and platinum complexes, [MCl2(P⁀P)] with two equivalents of NaSe⁀N (Se⁀N = SeCH2CH2NMe2; SeC5H3(3-R)N (R = H or Me)) afford cis-[M(Se⁀N)2(P⁀P)] (M = Pd or Pt; P⁀P = dppm, dppe or dppp).25,37,38 However, similar reactions with one equivalent of NaSeCH2CH2NMe2 in the presence of NaBPh4 yield cationic complexes [Pt2(SeCH2CH2NMe2)2(P⁀P)2][BPh4]2. In the case of monodentate phosphines like PPh3, the expected product [M{SeC4H3(3-R)X}2(PPh3)2] (M = Pd or Pt, R = H or Me, X = CH or N) exists in a dynamic equilibrium with another species [M{κ2-SeC4H3(3-R)X}{SeC4H3(3-R)X}(PPh3)] and PPh3 (Fig. 3).25,39 The latter complex, containing one chelating and another monodentate selenolate ligands, predominates at low temperature as revealed by 31P NMR spectroscopy. The short bite of the ligand and strong trans-influence of the selenolate ligand facilitate the formation of this species. Similar reactions with the other 3-substituted pyridyl selenolate yield primarily [M{κ2-SeC5H3(3-COR)N}{SeC5H3(3-COR)N}(PPh3)] (R = OH, NH2, NHPh, NHPym).40

N-Heteroaryl tellurolates, in contrast to their selenium counterparts, exhibited distinctly different reactivity patterns. This is attributed to a weaker Te–C bond and stronger nucleophilic character of the tellurolate ion. Both oxidative addition reactions between M(0) species and ditellurides and substitution reactions of MCl2(PR3)2 with NaTeR have been examined. Thus either the oxidative addition reaction between [Pt(PPh3)4] and {N(3-R)C5H3Te}2 or the treatment of PtCl2(PPh3)2 with NaTeC5H3(3-R)N yields the expected product [Pt{TeC5H3(3-R)N}2(PPh3)2] which exists in a dynamic equilibrium with the chelated species [M{κ2-TeC4H3(3-R)N}{TeC4H3(3-R)N}(PPh3)] as observed for selenolato complexes (vide supra). In addition to this product isolated as a yellow powder, a serendipitous product, [Pt{TeC5H3(R-3)N}(Te)(PPh3)], is also formed in ∼15% yield which is isolated as an orange crystalline solid.41 In the latter complex, a bare tellurium atom is coordinated to a platinum atom as a ligand. The geometry of this Te atom can be defined as a distorted trigonal bipyramidal with the platinum and two electron pairs at the equatorial positions and two nitrogen atoms from pyridyl tellurolate ligands at the axial positions with an N–Te–N angle of ∼166°. On the basis of isoelectronic relationship between Te0 and I+, the observed bis(pyridine) tellurium(0) structural motif can be compared with the well-known bis(pyridine)iodonium cation (Scheme 7).42
 Scheme 7 
Similar oxidative addition reactions of dipyridyl ditellurides on Pd(PPh3)4 result in [Pd{TeC5H3(3-R)N}2(PPh3)2] which in CDCl3 solution converts into a green coloured oxidation product [Pd(Cl){Te(Cl)2C5H3(3-R)N}(PPh3)], where the tellurolate ion is oxidized (Scheme 8).38 The latter is formed via [Pd{κ2-TeC4H3(3-R)N}{TeC4H3(3-R)N}(PPh3)]. The green complex can also be generated when [Pd(Cl){TeC5H3(3-Me)N}(PPh3)]26 is left in CDCl3 solution for several hours.
 Scheme 8 
The reactions, both oxidative addition and substitution reactions, involving palladium and platinum precursors containing chelating phosphines give several products depending on the metal centre and the nature of the phosphine ligand. The reaction between either [Pt2(dppm)3] and 2,2′-dipyridyl ditelluride or [PtCl2(dppm)] and NaTeC5H4N-2 yields cis-[Pt(TeC5H4N-2)2(dppm)], a major product (∼65% yield), as a yellow powder together with an orange crystalline derivative, [Pt{Ph2PC(TeC5H4N-2)PPh2}2] (∼20% yield) (Scheme 9).36 In contrast, the reaction between PtCl2(dppm) and NaTeC5H4N-4 gives exclusively [Pt{Ph2PC(TeC5H4N-4)PPh2}2] in 57% yield as a brown crystalline solid.29 The latter series of complexes are believed to be formed by the double deprotonation of methylene protons of dppm which is elicited by a strong nucleophilicity of the pyridyltellurolate ion.36 A similar reaction between PdCl2(dppm) and NaTeC5H4N-4 affords a tellurido/tellurolato complex, [Pd2(μ3-Te)(μ2-TeC5H4N-4)(TeC5H4N-4)(μ-dppm)]2, isolated as cubic-shaped black crystals in 75%yield.29 However, the reaction of palladium-dppm precursors with 2-pyridyltellurolate led to the formation of a complex mixture of products which could not be characterized.43
 Scheme 9 
In contrast to the Pt/Pd-dppm system, Pt-dppe precursors via both the reaction routes afford expected bis complexes [Pt(TeAr)2(dppe)] in ∼70% yield. However, in the case of 3-methylpryridyl tellurolate, the substitution reaction gives a complex of the composition [PtCl{TeC5H3(3-Me)N}(dppe)]. The latter is a non-electrolyte in chloroform solution, but in methanol or acetonitrile it behaves as a 1:1 electrolyte, [Pt{TeC5H3(3-Me)N}(dppe)][Cl]. The latter when treated with NaBPh4 results in a binuclear complex containing a bridging tellurolate ligand [Pt{TeC5H3(3-Me)N}(dppe)]2[BPh4]2 (Scheme 10).36 Although the expected bis complexes of palladium are isolated by the treatment of PdCl2(dppe) with Pb(TeAr)2, a similar reaction with NaTeAr in methanol followed by extraction with dichloromethane results in the formation of a red-crystalline solid, [Pd3(μ-Te)2(dppe)3]Cl2. The latter is also formed in the oxidative addition reaction between Pd(dppe)2 and Ar2Te2 in benzene followed by extraction with dichloromethane.38
 Scheme 10 
The reaction of Pt(dppp)2 with Te2Ar2 in benzene or the substitution reaction between [PtCl2(dppp)] and NaTeAr yields a mixture of products, viz. [Pt(TeAr)2(dppp)] and a trinuclear tellurido-bridged complex [Pt3(μ-Te)2(dppp)3]Cl2 which can be separated by column chromatography. The latter upon treatment with AgOTf gives the corresponding OTf complex,36 [Pt3(μ-Te)2(dppp)3][OTf]2. The treatment of either PdCl2(dppp) with NaTeC5H3(3-Me)N or Pd(dppp)2 with Ar2Te2 invariably resulted in the formation of [Pd3(μ-Te)2(dppp)3]Cl2 in fairly good yield as an orange-red crystalline solid (Scheme 11).38
 Scheme 11 
Metallophilic interactions in coinage metal complexes
Attractive interactions between metal centres with a closed shell electronic configuration (d10) in silver(I) and gold(I) complexes have been known for a long time and are referred to as argentophilic44 and aurophilic45 interactions, respectively. The term metallophilicity was first introduced by Pyykko et al. in 1994 to describe such attractive interactions collectively.46 Relativistic effects, which reach maximum at gold, have been attributed to this phenomenon. The metal⋯metal distance from crystal structural analysis has been considered as a diagnostic tool for metallophilic interactions.
Metallophilic interactions in coinage metal complexes derived from N-heteroaryl chalcogenolate ligands have been investigated. Homoleptic copper(I) complexes have been isolated as tetra- (e.g. [Cu{EC5H3(3-R)N}]4 (E = Se or Te, R = H or Me)/hexa- nuclear (e.g. [Cu{SeC4H(4,6-Me)2N2}]6) species with Cu–Cu contacts of 2.66–2.81 Å.47,48 In each case copper adopts a distorted square pyramidal configuration defined by pyridyl/pyrimidyl nitrogen and two bridging chalcogen atoms and two adjacent copper atoms. The tetranuclear complexes have a distorted tetrahedral core of copper atoms while the hexanuclear derivative comprises an octahedral core of copper atoms. The selenolato complexes with short Cu-Cu interactions are tetranuclear (e.g. [Cu{SeC5H3(3-Me)N}]4 with Cu–Cu = 2.66 Å) while a longer separation of Cu–Cu contacts results in a hexanuclear species (e.g. [Cu{SeC4H(4,6-Me)2N2}]6 with Cu–Cu = 2.74–2.82 Å).47
The evolution of argentophilic interactions has been mapped in the reactions of AgCl(PPh3) with thio/seleno pyridine ligands.48,49 Sequential release of the PPh3 ligand from the mononuclear complexes [Ag(Epy)(PPh3)3] leads to the emergence of Ag⋯Ag interactions (Scheme 12). With the extrusion of the PPh3 ligand, binuclear [Ag(μ-Epy)(PPh3)2]2 (no argentophilic interactions, Ag⋯Ag = 4.07 Å) and [Ag(μ-Epy)(PPh3)]2 (weak argentophilic interactions, Ag⋯Ag = 3.42 Å) complexes, a trinuclear complex [Ag3(μ-Sepy)3(PPh3)4] (silver atoms with single PPh3 exhibits Ag⋯Ag = 3.27 Å) and finally homoleptic hexanuclear complexes, [Ag(Epy)]6 (Ag⋯Ag = 2.81 Å), have been isolated as crystalline products. The trinuclear complex [Ag3(μ-Sepy)3(PPh3)4] represents an interesting example containing a six-membered Ag3Se3 ring in which argentophilic interactions are dictated by the number of coordinated PPh3 ligands to the metal centre. Silver atoms in these complexes adopt either a distorted tetrahedral or distorted trigonal configuration depending on the number of the ligating atoms.
 Scheme 12 
Aurophilic interactions in N-heteroaryl chalcogenolate gold(I) phosphine complexes, [Au(EAr)((PPh3)], are dictated by the presence of other secondary interactions, in particular non-bonding Au⋯N interactions.48,50 The complexes where there are strong intra-molecular Au⋯N interactions, discrete monomeric two-coordinate complexes (e.g. [Au(Sepyz-2)(PPh3)], [Au(Sepym-2)(PPh3)], and Au(SepymMe2)(PPh3)] (Fig. 4)50) have been isolated. The absence of such interactions has facilitated Au⋯Au interactions of the order of ∼3.2 Å (e.g. [Au(Sepy-4)(PPh3)] and [Au(Sepy-2)(PPh3)]) and as a consequence these complexes exist in the dimeric form.

Catalysis
Among various transition metal complexes, palladium complexes have played a pivotal role in metal catalysed organic transformations. Catalyst design has remained of paramount importance not only for understanding various catalytic processes but also for improving the activity of the catalytic system. A myriad of organic ligands, in particular phosphines, have been employed to develop numerous catalysts. Sulfur ligands, despite their rich transition metal chemistry, remained dormant as these ligands were believed to be catalyst poison. Thus, the palladium complexes derived from internally functionalized chalcogenolate ligands were considered as these were thought to serve as hemilabile ligands during the catalytic processes. Accordingly, different catalytic reactions using such complexes have been examined.
Among different catalytic reactions, the carbon–carbon cross-coupling of aryl halides with arylboronic acids, commonly known as Suzuki–Miura coupling reactions, has been investigated. Several bi- and tri-nuclear palladium complexes containing N,N-dimethylaminoalkyl chalcogenolate groups show catalytic activity in the C–C cross coupling reaction between aryl halides and phenyl boronic acid. Under optimized conditions, electron deficient aryl bromides give higher yield of the coupled product. Binuclear complexes show better catalytic activity than the trinuclear derivatives. Within a series, acetate complexes are more active than the corresponding halides (Table 2).51 Similarly, palladium complexes with internally functionalized chalcogenoethers, [PdCl2{RE(CH2)nNMe2}], have also been used in Suzuki coupling reactions.52 Better catalytic activity is noted upon increasing the chain length from a strongly chelating Me2NCH2CH2ER to a flexible Me2NCH2CH2CH2ER system.52

The complexes, [PdCl(SeC5H4N-4)(PPh3)2] and [Pd2(μ-SeC5H4N-4)2Cl2(PPh3)2], have been used as catalysts in Suzuki cross coupling reactions of arylbromide and phenylboronic acid. Both catalysts give similar yields of cross-coupled products under similar conditions. The catalysts are tolerant to various functional groups in arylbromide.28
The reaction of arylhalide with arylboronic acid in the presence of carbon monoxide, known as carbonylative Suzuki reaction, has been employed for the preparation of heteroaryl carbonyl compounds. Chalcogenolato complexes of palladium, with (e.g. [PdCl(SeCH2CH2NMe2)(PPh3)]) and without (e.g. [[PdCl(E⁀N)]n) phosphine ligands, have been investigated in carbonylative Suzuki reactions (Scheme 13). The phosphine complex exhibits better activity than those complexes without a phosphine ligand.53 Similarly, [PdCl(SeC5H4N-4)(PPh3)2] is an efficient catalyst for the amino carbonylation reaction of aryl/heteroaryl iodides with primary amines using CO in the presence of a base. The reaction takes place under mild conditions and is tolerant to a wide range of functional groups.54

Palladium complexes have also been examined in the Sonogashira reaction for the construction of external alkynes. The dimeric complex [PdCl(SeCH2CH2CH2NMe2)]2 shows the best catalytic activity in the reaction between iodobenzene and phenylacetylene giving excellent yield (97%) of diphenylacetylene (Scheme 14).55
 Scheme 14 
In palladium catalysed organic transformations, palladium complexes are believed to yield either coordinatively unsaturated palladium(0) species or palladium nano-particles (PdNPs) passivated by neutral ligands as the active species. The former complexes are seldom isolated. The acetate group in palladium(II) complexes (e.g. [{Pd(OAc)2}]3 and Pd(OAc)2L2] etc.) facilitates the formation of such species. Indeed, over a period of time, numerous acetato complexes of palladium have been designed and developed as successful catalytic systems. During the course of our investigation to design acetao/chalcogenolato complexes of palladium as a catalyst, a novel pentanuclear complex, [Pd5(OAc)3(SeCH2CH2NMe2)3][OTf]2 (Fig. 5), has been isolated. The complex comprises a one-dimensional polymeric chain of ‘Pd10’ units stabilized by Pd⋯Se interactions. One of the palladium atoms exists in the zero formal oxidation state (by XPS studies) and has a linear two-coordinate configuration.56

Molecular precursors for metal chalcogenides
Metal chalcogenide semiconductors represent an important family of inorganic materials and have made an everlasting impact on the progress and growth of opto-electronic and photovoltaic technologies. Metal chalcogenides are delicate materials needing a softer approach for their synthesis. A single source molecular approach has emerged as a versatile strategy for the synthesis of these materials and even for the isolation of metastable phases. Internally functionalized organochalcogenolate metal complexes have been successfully employed as molecular precursors for the synthesis of both binary (nano-crystals and thin films) and ternary chalcogenide materials.57
Coinage metal chalcogenides (I–VI materials)
The coinage metal chalcogenides are an interesting family of inorganic materials exhibiting a wide compositional and stoichiometric versatility. Temperature dependent phase transitions as well as composition variations are frequently encountered. They find numerous applications in photovoltaic, thermoelectric devices, photo-rechargeable batteries, etc.58 Homoleptic copper(I) chalcogenolates, [Cu{EC5H3(3-R)N}]4 and [Cu{SeC4H(4,6-Me)2N2}]6 (E = Se or Te; R = H or Me), have been used for the preparation of copper chalcogenide nano-crystals and for deposition of thin films.
The thermolysis of [Cu{SeC5H3(3-Me)N}]447 and [Cu{SeC4H(4,6-Me2)N2}]648 in coordinating solvents like HDA/TOPO (HAD = hexadecylamine; TOPO = tri-n-octylphosphine oxide) and dodecanethiol (DDT), respectively yields a cubic phase of Cu7Se4 (Fig. 6). These precursors have been successfully used for the deposition of thin films of copper selenide by AACVD (aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition). The former complex ([Cu{SeC5H3(3-Me)N}]4) produces films of orthorhombic Cu5Se4 in the temperature range of 360–400 °C (Fig. 7),47 while the latter ([Cu{SeC4H(4,6-Me)2N2}]6) gives films of cubic Cu7Se4 at 400 °C.48 The films show continuous grains that are overlapping on the substrate. Silver pyridyl/pyrimidyl selenolates either in the solid state or in DDT solution upon thermolysis give orthorhombic Ag2Se.48,49

The thermolysis of copper tellurolates [Cu{TeC5H3(3-R)N}]4 (R = H or Me) under different conditions give different compositions and phases of copper tellurides. Tetranuclear copper pyridyl tellurolate, [Cu{TeC5H3(3-R)N}]4 (R = H or Me), in TOPO at 150 °C yields spherical nanoparticles of hexagonal Cu2−xTe and tetragonal Cu2.8Te2, respectively.47 High quality films of Cu1.85Te could also be deposited on a glass substrate at 350 °C using [Cu{TeC5H3(3-Me)N}]4 (Fig. 8).47

Zinc, cadmium and mercury chalcogenides (II–VI materials)
A variety of complexes of zinc triad have been designed which undergo clean decomposition. They have been used as single source molecular precursors for metal sulfide,59 selenide60–65 and telluride66,67 nano-materials. A number of precursors, based on either internally functionalized selenolate ligands or selenocarboxylates, have been developed for metal selenide nanoparticles.60–65 The facile cleavage of the C–Se linkage in selenocarboxylates offers an attractive potential for MSe synthesis. The zinc and cadmium complexes [M(SeCOAr)2(tmeda)] (tmeda = N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl ethylenediamine) undergo a three-step decomposition (by TGA) leading to the formation of polycrystalline metal selenide nano-crystals. The corresponding mercury complex could not be isolated but during the synthesis gave a black powder identified as cubic HgSe. The pyrolysis of [Cd(SeCOtol)2(tmeda)] in HDA at 230 °C yields red coloured cubic CdSe nanoparticles of average diameter of ∼15 nm.61
The monomeric complexes, [M(Se(CH2)nNMe2)2] (M = Zn, Cd; n = 2 or 3), undergo a one- or two- (overlapping) step decomposition to give exclusively MSe.60,62,63 Both hexagonal and cubic CdSe could be isolated by the pyrolysis of [Cd(SeCH2CH2NMe2)2] in a vacuum and flowing inert gas, respectively.63 Thermolysis in the HDA-TOPO mixture affords HDA capped cubic CdSe nanoparticles, the emission of which is size dependent (Fig. 9).63 Attempts to prepare an analogous mercury complex, [Hg(SeCH2CH2NMe2)2], however, result in the formation of a black powder identified as cubic HgSe.63 In contrast, the complexes [Hg(TeCH2CH2NMe2)2]66 and [Hg(SeCH2CH2CH2NMe2)2]62 could be isolated in pure form which upon pyrolysis under flowing argon in a furnace gives polycrystalline cubic HgE (E = Se or Te).

Monomeric cadmium [Cd(SeAr)2(tmeda)] and mercury [Hg(SeAr)2]/[Hg(SeAr)2(tmeda)] (Ar = 2-py, 4,6-Me2C4HN2) selenolates have been used for the synthesis of metal selenide nano-crystals.64,65 The thermolysis of cadmium complexes in coordinating solvents (TOPO, HAD or OA (OA = oleylamine)) gives red coloured hexagonal CdSe nano-crystals whereas mercury complexes in HDA or OA at 100–145 °C yield cubic HgSe nanoparticles (Fig. 10).64,65

The 2-pyridyl tellurolato complexes [M{TeC5H3(3-R)N}2] (M = Cd or Hg; R = H or Me) upon pyrolysis yield metal tellurides.67 The cadmium complex under an argon atmosphere at 350 °C yields cubic CdTe whereas in HDA or TOPO at 160 °C it affords red or yellow spherical nano-crystals of hexagonal CdTe.
Indium selenide
Tris selenolate of indium, [In(SeC5H3(3-Me)N}3], prepared by the reaction of InCl3 with NaSeC5H3(3-Me)N in a benzene–methanol mixture, upon thermolysis in HDA, TOPO or OA at 330 °C, yields agglomerated spheres (in HDA), a spherical morphology (in TOPO) and sheet like structures (in OA) of In2Se3. The average diameter and length of the rods obtained from HDA are 57–76 nm and 400 nm, respectively.68 The complex, [Me2In(SeC5H4N-4)]n, a one-dimensional polymer, in the solid state undergoes a two-step decomposition under an argon atmosphere to yield In2Se3, whereas in oleylamine at 250 °C it gives nano-crystals (diameter ∼50 nm) of hexagonal of In2Se3.69
Tin and lead chalcogenides
Tin forms two narrow direct-band semiconductor selenides, viz. orthorhombic SnSe (band gap ∼1.0 eV) and hexagonal SnSe2 (band gap ∼0.9 eV). The photoelectric properties of the former have been used for solar cell applications while the layer structure of the latter has been utilized in lithium ion batteries. Diorganotin(IV) 2-pyridyl and 2-primidyl chalcogenolates, [R2Sn(Epy/Epym)2] and [R2Sn(Epy/Epym)(Cl)], have been developed as single source molecular precursors for tin selenides.70–72 The former has a distorted skew trapezoidal six coordinate tin (Fig. 11a) while the latter acquires a trigonal bipyramidal configuration. Depending on the nature of the selenolate ligand, both SnSe and SnSe2 nanostructures have been prepared. The complexes, [But2Sn(Sepy-2)2]70 and [But2Sn{SeC4H(4,6-Me)2N2}2]72, have also been employed for the deposition of phase pure orthorhombic SnSe (at 490 °C) and hexagonal SnSe2 (at 375 °C) films, respectively on a p-type silicon(100) substrate. The SnSe films show continuous grain boundaries that overlap on the substrate. These films showed photo response on a Si/SnSe/Au configuration with a 20% increase in the current.70

The PbE (E = S or Se) quantum dots can be prepared conveniently from [Pb(ECH2CH2NMe2)2] and [Pb(SeCH2CH2COOMe)2] in refluxing HDA at moderately low temperatures.73 The pyrolysis of [Pb(SeCH2CH2NMe2)2] (Fig. 12) affords PbSe nanoparticles of ∼10 nm diameter.

Antimony and bismuth selenides
The 2-pyridyl and 2-pyrimidyl selenolates of antimony and bismuth, [M(SeAr)3] (M = Sb or Bi; Ar = 2-C5H4N, 2-C5H3(3-Me)N, 2-C4H(4,6-Me)2N2), have been successfully employed for the synthesis of M2Se3 nano crystals.74,75 The thermolysis of [M{SeC5H3(3-Me)N}3] (in HDA)74 and [M{SeC4H(4,6-Me)2N2}2] (in oleylamine)75 affords orthorhombic and rhombohedral phases of Sb2Se3 and Bi2Se3, respectively. The TEM images of Sb2Se3 showed the formation of nano-rods (40–60 nm diameter and 0.6–1.4 μm length) whereas Bi2Se3 appeared as flake like nano-crystals. The antimony complex has also been used for the deposition of thin films of orthorhombic Sb2Se3 on a glass substrate by AACVD in the temperature range of 375–500 °C. The films grew preferentially in the (221) direction and showed nano-wire like structures (240–500 nm diameter and several microns length) (Fig. 13).74 In contrast, the bismuth complex produced different compositions of bismuth selenide depending on the substrate temperature, films becoming selenium deficient with increasing temperature.

Ternary metal chalcogenides
Besides binary chalcogenide materials, ternary chalcogenides, such as I–III–VI and I–IV–VI, represent yet another interesting family of inorganic materials that show remarkable photovoltaic and thermoelectric properties. Copper based chalcogenides with diamond like structures are promising thermoelectric materials due to their low thermal conductivity and tunable transport properties. Their synthesis is, quite often, a challenging task due to the existence of not only different compositions but also diverse phases (e.g. Cu2SnSe3 can be isolated in monoclinic, cubic, tetragonal or orthorhombic phases).57
Molecular precursors have been successfully employed to isolate monophasic materials. The thermolysis of a 1:1 mixture of [Cu{SeC5H3(3-Me)N}]4 and [In{SeC5H3(3-Me)N}3] in HDA, TOPO or oleylamine at 300 °C yields nearly spherical particles (400 nm diameter) of tetragonal CuInSe2 (Fig. 14).68 Similarly, the thermolysis of a 2:1 molar ratio of [Cu{SeC5H3(3-Me)N}]4 and [Me2Sn{SeC5H3(3-Me)N}2] in oleylamine at 300 °C yields nanostructures (11 ± 1 nm) of phase pure cubic Cu2SnSe3 which show photo response in a photo-electrochemical cell with a power conversion efficiency of 1.7% (Fig. 15).76

Organoselenium compounds in biology
Selenium is an essential micronutrient for animals and humans. It exists in the form of selenocysteine at the active site of several selenoenzymes (e.g., glutathione peroxidase, GPx) which are believed to be responsible for most of the biological effects of selenium.77 Its deficiency is linked to various diseases. Inspired by the importance of natural selenoenzymes, considerable efforts have been made by several groups to develop synthetic organoselenium compounds which can imitate functions exhibited by such enzymes. Different families of organoselenium compounds, such as ebselen,78 DSePA,79etc., have been designed and synthesized which show GPx like activities.78–81 Attempts have also been made to synthesize organoselenium compounds by the incorporation of selenium in biologically relevant molecules such as nicotinic acid (vitamin B3), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), nicotinamide, etc., with the hope that the resulting compound would exhibit better biological activities. Accordingly, selenium substituted pyridine and pyrimidine ring systems have been designed and developed by us82–88 and others.89–91 In contrast to the vast exploration on organoselenium compounds in biological systems, particularly as an antioxidant,1 organotellurium compounds are scarcely investigated.92–94

In vitro antioxidant activity of several pyridine and pyrimidine based organoselenium compounds has been evaluated by different methods.82,83,89 Their GPx like activity falls in the following order: py2Se2 > pym2Se2 > Ar2Se2 (Ar = C6H4X; X = H, 4-F, 4-Cl, 4-MeO, or 3-CF3).83,89 2,2′-Dipyridyl diselenide shows much better antioxidant activity than other diselenides. This is attributed to the ring nitrogen atom which facilitates radical formation and is supported by the fact that the compound exhibits radical (ABTS) (ABTS = 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)-scavenging activity at low concentrations (≥5 μM). Interestingly ABTS radical-scavenging activity of py2Se2 is superior to ascorbic acid (10 μM) whereas other diselenides hardly show any such activity.89 The antioxidant activity of these compounds depends on various functional groups attached to selenium and also on the overall electron density at selenium which is manifested from 77Se NMR chemical shifts. From the 77Se NMR chemical shifts, the electron density at the selenium atom increases in the following order: py2Se2 > Ph2Se2 > pym2Se2 (Fig. 16).83 The GPx activity is in accord with this trend. However, the reverse trend is noted for Ph2Se2 and pym2Se2, although both of them show poor activity. This is attributed to the ability of pym2Se2 to form selenenic acid stabilized by Se⋯N interactions while such interactions will be absent for the phenyl derivative.83 Monoselenides, both symmetrical and asymmetrical, show much lower or hardly any antioxidant activity.83

Polymorphism is one of the important factors that affect the efficacy of pharmaceutical drugs. Polymorphism of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) remains a challenge in drug development. More than 50% APIs are known to exist in multiple polymorphs and are responsible for differences in many properties.95,96 Polymorphism in some dipyridyl diselenides has been noted and therefore was considered for structure–property correlations. Two polymorphs, orthorhombic97 and monoclinic,18 of 2,2′-dipryridyl diselenide have been isolated and structurally characterized. 2,2′-Diselenobis(3-pyridinol) ({N(3-HO)C5H3Se}2) upon recrystallization from methanol–water and methanol–chloroform crystallizes in the monoclinic space group with different cell parameters and crystal morphology.87 The molecules in both forms are associated through strong and distinctly directed hydrogen bonds. In the case of the former, the molecules are interlocked through intermolecular O–H⋯N hydrogen bonds forming 3-D sheets, whereas in the latter, helical chains of two different orientations are formed by both intra- and inter-molecular O–H⋯N hydrogen bonds (Fig. 17).87 The two polymorphs differ with a very small energy barrier. 2,2′-Diseleno bis(3-nicotinamide) upon recrystallization from DMSO and DMF gives monoclinic88 and orthorhombic88/triclinic98 forms. Both polymorphs show secondary hydrogen bonding with the lattice solvent molecules. It has also been noted that strong electron withdrawing groups (e.g., –COOH, –CONH2, –CONHPh82,88) at the C-3 position in the pyridyl ring favour a planar structure (C–Se–Se–C torsion angle of ∼180°) with a crystal packing density of 1.6–1.7 g cm−3, whereas py2Se2 and [N(3-HO)C5H3Se]2 adopt a bent (C–Se–Se–C torsion angle of ∼90°) structure with a packing density of ∼2 g cm−3. These structural factors are manifested in their GPx like antioxidant activity; compounds with stronger electron withdrawing groups at C-3 positions show better activity.88 It is worth noting that the catalytic activity of organochalcogen bearing pyridinols, x-HOC5H3(2-ER)N (x = 3 or 5; E = S, Se, Te; R = n-octyl or Ph) has been assessed as inhibitors for the azo-initiated peroxidation of linoleic acid as well as reduction of H2O2 in the presence of thiol.94 Among these compounds, tellurium containing pyridinol showed high antioxidant activity.
 Fig. 17  Molecular structures of 2,2′-diselenobis(3-pyridinol) with hydrogen bonding interactions (reproduced with permission from Elsevier, ref. 87, J. Organomet. Chem., 2017, 852, 1). 
GPx and radical-scavenging activity and cytotoxicity of several nicotinamide based organoselenium compounds have been studied by absorption spectroscopic methods, HPLC analysis, 1H and 77Se NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.82,84,86,87 The activity of these compounds depends on the nature of substituents attached to the nitrogen of the amide group or at selenium. Any substitution leads to considerable reduction of both GPx and radical-scavenging activities with reference to 2,2′-diseleno bis(3-nicotinamide) (6). The GPx activity of 6 evaluated by the HPLC method is about 6 times higher than the well-known selenium compound, ebselen.85 The stopped-flow kinetic studies with a global analysis of GPx like activity catalysing the reduction of H2O2 by glutathione reveals a bimolecular rate constant. The activity is initiated by the reduction of diselenide to RSeSG (R = NC5H3CONH2) and a stable selone which is believed to be responsible for its efficient GPx like activity. Quantum chemical analysis also supports that selone is the reduced species rather than selenol. From 77Se NMR spectra resonances due to selone, selenenyl sulfide, selenenic acid and seleninic acid have been identified in the catalytic process.84 From these studies various reaction routes involved in the GPx like catalysis are depicted in Scheme 15.

2,2′-Diseleno bis(3-nicotinamide) (6) at micromolar concentrations protects both lipids and DNA from AAPH (2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine)dihydrochloride) generated radicals and γ-radiation. It also protects radiation induced cell death. The radio-protective effect has been attributed to increased levels of GPx and GSH in irradiated cells (Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) and MCF7) even administered after exposure to radiation. Its radioprotective effect is also complemented by its ability to prevent radiation-induced DNA damage.87 It is non-toxic to normal cells but slightly toxic to A549 (lung carcinoma) and NIH3T3 (mouse embryo fibroblasts) cancer cells as evaluated by the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] method.85 2,2′-Diselenobis(3-pyridinol) exhibits cytotoxicity against A549 human lung carcinoma cells with an IC50 value of ∼10 μM.87
Conclusions
In this perspective, it has been demonstrated that versatility and utility of organochalcogen compounds in diverse areas can be realized by a proper design of these compounds. Internal functionalization introduced through the hard donor centre in these compounds serves as a tool to design metal complexes with diverse structural motifs. Unprecedented reactivity of heteroaryl organochalcogen compounds arises due to a weaker C–E bond and results in the formation of several serendipitous products. Such organochalcogen compounds may lead to the exploration of a rich chemistry of metal chalcogenolates. Their metal complexes, owing to a clean cleavage of the C–E bond as well as their solubility in organic solvents, have emerged as successful precursors for the preparation of technologically important and synthetically challenging ternary semiconducting metal chalcogenides.
The dogma associated with chalcogen compounds as catalyst poison turns out to be an illusion. In fact, the palladium complexes with chalcogen ligands, discussed here and by several other researchers in the recent past, not only show good catalytic activity but also provide an opportunity to identify low-valent, low-coordinated catalytic intermediates. Such species are often believed to be active catalytic species responsible for the organic transformation catalysed by palladium complexes.
In these unprecedented times due to Covid-19, organoselenium compounds show promise to emerge as lead drug molecules. Ebselen, a synthetic organoselenium compound investigated for the treatment of multiple diseases, has been shown to inhibit Covid-19 virus replication in cell-based assays.99 In short, internally functionalized organochalcogen compounds would offer new challenges and opportunities in different domains of science and technology.
