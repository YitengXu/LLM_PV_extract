    , Accepted 28th January 2013First published on 29th January 2013AbstractTwo new D–π–A sensitizers (L101 and L102) incorporating 5H-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo [3,4-f]isoindole-5,7(6H)-dione and 6H-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline-6,8(7H)-dione core structures were synthesized and tested in liquid dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). L102 achieved a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.2% (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2).
Since the breakthrough introducing mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cell prototypes by Grätzel and co-workers in 1991,1 huge efforts have been made to push up their power conversion efficiency by researchers working on every aspect of the cell. Among them the sensitizer (dye) remains one of the most studied areas and hundreds of dyes have been reported to date.2 Currently there are three major categories of sensitizers: metal–organic complexes, organic dyes and recently developed inorganic sensitizers such as quantum dots3 and perovskites.4 The metal complexes mainly include metal–pyridyl complexes, porphyrins and phthalocyanines, which have all shown promising performance and are the subjects of major research efforts dedicated to optimization of their properties and device efficiencies. However, they often suffer problems such as high toxicity, high cost (especially for the high performing Ru-based dyes), narrow absorption windows, and inconsistent stability, as well as having compatibility issues with currently available organic hole transporting materials (HTM). On the other hand, the organic dyes have advantages such as structural diversity, which enables fine tuning of their properties, lower cost of production, and more eco-friendly synthesis.
Inspired by the great achievements in bulk heterojunction solar cells incorporating benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole5 and quinoxaline6 units and several promising organic sensitizers based on them,7 we decided to design novel sensitizers containing their derivatives as the core structures due to their strong intramolecular charge transfer properties, synthetic flexibility and high stability. In this work, we report two new D–π–A sensitizers with building blocks: 5H-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo [3,4-f]isoindole-5,7(6H)-dione and 6H-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline-6,8(7H)-dione, as π-components (Fig. 1). The synthetic route to the sensitizers L101 and L102 is given in Scheme 1. Details of the synthesis can be found in the ESI.†

The absorption spectra of the two dyes are shown in Fig. 2 and results are summarized in Table 1 together with the cyclic voltammetry data (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The maximum absorption of L101 was exhibited at 542 nm with an absorptivity (ε) of 4.3 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and that of L102 was exhibited at 477 nm with an ε of 3.9 × 104 M−1 cm−1. The red-shift of the absorption maximum for L101 as compared to that for L102 was due to the stronger quinoid character of the core structure of the former, which resulted in stronger intramolecular charge transfer. This observation is very similar to our earlier studies on comparisons between the structurally related thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxalines and pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxalines.8

Liquid DSCs were fabricated to test the photovoltaic performance of these two sensitizers. (Device fabrication details can be found in the ESI.†) The output characteristics are summarized in Table 2. L102 had a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.20%, which is better than for L101, which shows a PCE of 4.14%. Both short-circuit current (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) of L101 were clearly lower (Jsc: 8.86 mA cm−2; Voc: 0.63 V) than those of L102 (Jsc: 12.0 mA cm−2; Voc: 0.73 V). We attribute this result to the difference between the core structures since the rest of the device parameters are identical (Fig. 3).

 Fig. 3  Photocurrent–voltage curves (both light on and off) of DSCs sensitized by L101 and L102 under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. 
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSCs based on L101 and L102 are shown in Fig. 4 (left). L101 showed a broad solar light response from 300 to 800 nm with a maximum value of 49% at 510 nm. On the other hand, L102 had a maximum value of 77% at 475 nm despite the relatively narrower absorption range. The lower EQE for L101 explained the lower Jsc from I–V measurement. As mentioned earlier, L101 has a stronger electron-accepting core structure which helps electron delocalization between the donor and the acceptor thus having a lower band gap than L102. However, it may also lead to high exciton binding energy if the LUMO of the sensitizer is located in the central core, where the excited electrons will face larger obstacles to dissociation and injection into TiO2. This is also reflected by the lower lying LUMO (−3.75 eV) of L101 as determined by cyclic voltammetry as compared to that of L102 (−3.59 eV) with the less electron-accepting quinoxaline π-component (Table 1). The latter thus has a greater driving force for electron transfer.
 Fig. 4  Left: IPCE spectra of L101 and L102. Right: recombination resistance of L101 and L102 obtained from EIS. 
The charge recombination process is one of the major limiting factors in the cell performance. It is related to the interface process and is determined by the type of sensitizer, the method of deposition, the use of additional coatings and the type of electrolyte especially in liquid DSCs.9 The plot of the recombination resistance (Rrec) for both sensitizers is shown in Fig. 4 (right) by fitting the data obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) into the Bisquert equivalent circuit model for liquid DSCs.10 The applied voltage (x-axis) was rescaled as a function of the common equivalent conduction band (CB) voltage (Vecb), taking into account the shift in the chemical capacitance to eliminate the effect of the TiO2 CB position. It is clear that the Rrec of L101 is significantly smaller (the recombination rate is larger) than that of L102 (e.g. 3.5 kΩ for L101versus 20 kΩ for L102 when extrapolating to Vecb = 0). A large Rrec is always preferable, indicating that the electron–hole recombinations in the absorber material and within the electrolyte, i.e. separated excitons, are strongly reduced. Given that the position of the conduction band of TiO2 is very likely to be similar for the two dyes, having identical anchoring groups, the difference in Voc is directly attributed to the difference in Rrec (Table 2). It is worth mentioning that the intermolecular interaction of L101 is probably stronger than that of L102 due to the two bulky twisted phenyl rings linked to the quinoxaline moiety in the latter, which might further boost the recombination process in L101.
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized two new D–π–A sensitizers L101 and L102 with 5H-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo [3,4-f]isoindole-5,7(6H)-dione and 6H-pyrrolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline-6,8(7H)-dione as π-components, respectively. An L102-sensitized solar cell achieved a promising PCE of 6.2% with a Jsc of 12.0 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.73 V. Despite the broader absorption window, L101 had a relatively lower PCE of 4.14% mainly due to the stronger electron-accepting core structure which limited the dissociation of the excitons as observed in the IPCE spectra, resulting in a lower Jsc (8.86 mA cm−2). Furthermore, EIS studies showed that L101 had a larger recombination rate, leading to a lower Voc (0.63 V).
