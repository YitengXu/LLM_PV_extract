    , Accepted 30th September 2020First published on 30th September 2020AbstractQuantum dot (QD)-based materials have been employed to enhance thermodynamic and kinetic properties of electrochemical reactions for energy storage and engineering. Nonetheless, the high reactivity, chemical instability, material agglomeration and low electrical conductivity of QDs are still the main challenges in their large-scale application. In this review, we compiled the state-of-the-art research activities on QD-carbonaceous-based nanohybrids in rechargeable energy storage applications, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) and supercapacitors. In addition, the corresponding storage mechanisms of representative examples are discussed, and perspectives on future research directions are provided to facilitate further innovation and research in this field.
1. Introduction
Energy utilization and transformation have facilitated human civilization, supported social production, and enriched human needs.1–3 In particular, the development and utilization of clean and green energy to replace fossil fuels is the inevitable trend of this era.4 The demand for renewable energy sources, such as solar, bioenergy, tidal energy, and wind energy has increased exponentially in the last decade.5–8 Accordingly, rechargeable energy storage devices have emerged as essential technology. Secondary batteries and supercapacitors are two of the most efficient and applicable technologies for electrochemical energy conversion and storage.4 The former is based on the redox reaction of electrode materials to store ions and charges, while the latter is to achieve energy storage through the electric double layer that adsorbs charges on the surface of materials.5 The acceleration of real-life development and the indispensability of smart devices continue to demand higher requirements for energy storage devices, such as increased energy density and short charging time.6,7 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)7–9 have been commercialized as first-class power source devices for electric energy storage and electric vehicles due to their high capacity, long cycle life, and environment friendliness. However, considering that the elemental abundance of sodium and potassium in the Earth's crust will reduce costs, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs)1,10 and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs)11,12 are considered as powerful alternatives to LIBs, and provide more possibility of realizing large-scale energy storage applications. In addition, PIBs have lower standard redox potential than that of Na (−2.93 V for K+/K and −2.71 V for Na+/Na vs. SHE), which is very close to Li+/Li. However, there are still significant challenges associated with rechargeable batteries that need to be addressed, such as intrinsic poor electrical conductivity, low ion diffusion rate in pure electrode materials, and formation of a solid-electrolyte interface (SEI).13
Consequently, decreasing the size of anode materials to the nanoscale has been considered an effective technique to overcome or alleviate the aforementioned disadvantages.14,15 Compared with traditional materials, nanostructure materials with larger electrochemically active surfaces can alter the energy storage mechanism, and hence greatly improve the power density and cycle life for energy storage applications. Besides, the combination of high electronic and ionic conducting materials with the inherent strength and flexibility of low-dimensional materials can provide thin, flexible, and structural energy storage solutions. In addition, nano-size affects the thermodynamic aspects due to excess surface contributions, giving rise to enhanced operational voltage in devices.16,17 Moreover, the narrowly spaced interfaces can further result in rapid energy storage.15
Quantum dots, as zero-dimensional materials exhibiting quantum confinement effects have aroused tremendous attention for various applications owing to their fascinating intrinsic characteristics such as quantum size effect,15,18 quantum tunneling effect, coulomb blockade effect, surface effect, dielectric confinement effect, quantum confinement effect,17 and generation of multiple excitions.19,20 The last decade has witnessed an exponential growth of activity in exploring the growth mechanisms of new types of QDs and their potential applications.21–23 Compared with bulk materials, QDs are small enough to fully contact the electrolyte, the ion diffusion distance is shorter, and they can be easily combined with other materials when applied in energy storage devices. However, the application of QDs is still hindered by multiple limitations. The high specific surface area of QDs is often accompanied by high reactivity, reducing their chemical stability, and thus degrading the corresponding device performance.14,24 In addition, their agglomeration and low electrical conductivity also need to be solved.25 In this review, a comprehensive summary of the progress of quantum dot-carbonaceous-based materials for electrochemical energy storage is provided, where representative examples and the corresponding storage mechanisms are discussed.
2. Preparation of QD-carbonaceous materials for energy storage
In recent years, many types of QDs have been developed using various approaches and applied in energy storage devices, such as metal oxide QDs (TiO2,26 SnO2,27,28 ZnO,29 MnO,30,31 Co3O4,32,33 CuO,34,35 Fe3O4,36,37 Nb2O5,38 V2O5,39etc.), metal sulfide QDs (MoS2,40 FeS,41 Co9S8,42 ZnS,43,44 SnS,45etc.), metal selenides (CdSe,43 SnSe,46 SnSe2,47 FeSe2,41etc.), metal phosphides (FeP48)and elemental QDs (Ag,49 Ge,50 Ru,51 Au,52 Si,53 P,54 carbon,24,55 grahene,56,57etc.). Currently, the QDs used in lithium batteries mainly include SnO2, TiO2, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, ZnO, CuO, Co3O4, MnO, V2O5, SnSe2, CoS2, CoS, MoS2, ZnS, carbon and graphene. The QDs used in SIBs include SnO2, Fe3O4, TiO2, CuO, MnO, Co3O4, MoS2, ZnS, SnS, FeS2, Co9S8, CoS, SnSe2, P, carbon and graphene, and in PIBs, they include FeSe2, Co0.85Se, CoS, and MoS2. However, there is less research work on the application of QDs in SIBs and PIBs than in lithium batteries thus far. As is known, the ion radius of sodium/potassium is much larger than that of the lithium ion. Therefore, in general, QDs used in sodium/potassium batteries require a larger lattice spacing than that of lithium batteries. A larger lattice spacing facilitates the insertion and extraction of sodium/potassium ions and a larger electrochemical reaction interface.48,58 QDs with a larger lattice spacing facilitate the intercalation and deintercalation of sodium/potassium ions, leading to more adequate electrochemical reactions. The electrochemical performances of QD-based materials for energy storage are summarized in Table 1.

The combination of QDs with carbonaceous materials to increase their conductivity and prevent agglomeration has been considered an effective method to improve their cycling stability.71,72 Numerous reports describe the process for the preparation of quantum dot-carbonaceous composites. Two main methods can be distinguished, where one is that the precursor material reacts after heat treatment process to generate QDs and anchor in other materials. The other common method is to combine pre-synthesized QDs with other materials by stirring, ball milling or hydrothermal treatment. We included a list of the synthetic methods for QD-carbonaceous materials for an intuitive comparison. However, there are many novel methods to prepare electrodes with specific shapes and functions, such as ALD,73 electrospinning,65 and microwave treatment.32 Thus, Table 2 summarizes the synthetic methods for quantum dot-carbonaceous materials.

The electrode materials prepared using the general methods will be introduced in more detail later. For example, Zhang et al. reported the synthesis of MOF-derived ZnO@ZnO QD/C core–shell nanorod arrays on carbon cloth as an anode for Li-ion batteries (Fig. 1a).29 Firstly, ZnO nanorod/carbon cloth was synthesized via a low-temperature solution deposition route. Secondly, the ZnO@ZnO QD/C core–shell nanorod arrays were prepared via a hydrothermal method using ZnO rods as the template and the Zn source for the ZnO QDs. Through annealing, the ZnO QD-coated amorphous carbon layer well adhered to the carbon cloth substrate. In addition, a three-dimensional porous carbon network encapsulated the SnO2 QDs as the anode (Fig. 1b).74 The 3D carbon structure was obtained by hydrothermal treatment, and then immersed in the precursor solution of SnO2 QDs, and sintered to obtain SnO2 QDs with a size of 3–5 nm. The SnO2 QDs were uniformly distributed on the surface of the 3D carbon structure, which effectively buffered the pressure caused by their volume changes the during charge and discharge progress.

Wearable batteries are an increasingly attractive area, and accordingly QD-based flexible electrodes have been reported. Fe3O4 QD-decorated MoS2 nanosheet arrays on graphite paper as free-standing SIB anodes were reported.37 The preparation process mainly included three steps, as shown in Fig. 1c. Firstly, MoS2 was grown on graphite paper via a hydrothermal method, and then the precursor of Fe3O4 QDs was attached to MoS2 by low-temperature hydrolysis, and after sintering, the Fe3O4 QD-modified electrode array material was obtained. The Fe3O4 QDs prevented the agglomeration of the adjacent MoS2 and promoted electrolyte penetration into the active surface of the MoS2 electrode material, thereby preventing structural collapse during charging and discharging.
The above methods of combining QDs with other materials mainly involve reacting the precursor material after heat treatment process to generate QDs and anchoring them in other materials. Another common method is to combine pre-synthesized QDs with other materials by stirring, ball milling or hydrothermal treatment. An SnO2 QD@graphene 3D flexible skeleton composite electrode (Fig. 2a) was prepared by mixing pre-synthesized SnO2 QDs with an aqueous suspension of graphene oxide (GO), which was stirred and calcined.64 The SnO2 QDs were pre-synthesized through hydrolysis, water and oxidation processes. This composite electrode possessed a large specific surface area and fast ion transport, which affected the electrochemical performance of the LIB, besides its long-term cycling performance, as shown in Fig. 2b. Further, CuO/Cu/graphene QD (referred to as CCG) triaxial nanowire arrays were successfully designed and synthesized, as shown in Fig. 2c.75 The graphene QDs were synthesized from graphene powder via a modified Staudenmaier method. Then, the graphene QDs were attached to the surface of CuO nanowires through electrophoresis. Because the Cu layer protected the inner CuO from release in the charge process, the graphene QDs could further protect the active material from forming SEI layers. Thus, the initial CE of the CCG electrodes was radically improved compared with the bare CuO, namely 82% for the CC coaxial nanowire electrode and 87% for the CCG triaxial nanowire electrode. The CCG nanowire anodes maintained greater than 80% capacity after 300 cycles because of its good electric conductivity and stability of the active material. In addition, graphene QD-modified yolk–shell NiO microspheres were also obtained, as shown in Fig. 2d.76 The overall synthetic routine mainly includes three steps, namely the synthesis of Ni-MOF via the hydrothermal method, thermal treatment of Ni-MOF to obtain the NiO yolk–shell structure, and mixing graphene QDs with NiO and stirring for several hours. The influence of QDs modified by different functional groups (carboxyl groups and amino groups) on the performance of the device was also studied. The results showed that the graphene QDs modified with carboxyl-functionalized groups exhibited a better performance than that of the graphene QDs modified with amino-functionalized groups. However, both electrodes exhibited superior lithium storage performances compared to that of the pure NiO material because of the inherent electron conductive property and mechanical buffer effect of the graphene QDs. In addition, the MOF-derived mesoporous and yolk–shell structure is also a significant reason for the enhanced lithium storage performance, which could buffer the volume change in the electrode during the charge and discharge processes. This method for the pre-synthesis of QDs compounding with other materials can more precisely control the particle size, size distribution and surface functional groups of QDs.

On the other hand, some new methods have also been developed to synthesize high quality QDs. ZnO QD/graphene nanocomposites were prepared via atomic layer deposition (ALD), as shown in Fig. 3a.73 Due to its unique self-limiting nature, low growth temperature, precise control of film thickness and large deposition area, ALD has been considered as a promising technology for the fabrication complex nanostructures. By controlling the number of depositions, the size of ZnO QDs could be controlled from 2 nm to 7 nm. It was also demonstrated that the smaller-sized particles led to better electrochemical performances. When the particle size was 2 nm, the capacity (960 mA h g−1) of the ZnO electrode was close to the theoretical capacity (978 mA h g−1). However, smaller QDs are not always better for the performance of the energy storage devices. GeO2 nanoparticles with different sizes of 2 nm, 6 nm, 10 nm and 35 nm were prepared, and their effect of quantum confinement and their related effects on the electrochemical performances of LIB were also investigated, as revealed in Fig. 3b.17 It was found that the 6 nm-sized GeO2 showed the best performances, while the 2 nm-sized GeO2 showed inferior performances. This is due to the low electrical conductivity of the 2 nm-sized GeO2 caused by its stronger quantum confinement effect, which is related to an increase in the charge transfer resistance. Moreover, smaller particles are more likely to aggregate during cycling because of their higher surface energy, which limits the mobility of Li in the active material during the charge and discharge processes. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the impact of the quantum confinement effect and the short ion diffusion path. Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) was used to prepare heterostructured graphene QD/MnO2 nanosheets with strong Mn–O–C bonds as high-potential window electrodes, as shown in Fig. 3c.77 The heterostructure enlarged the operating potential window from 0–1 V to 0–1.3 V because of the potential drop in the built-in electric field of the graphene QD/MnO2 heterostructure region, and improved the specific capacitance to 1170 F g−1. Using in situ formed heterostructures to increase the voltage window is essential for energy storage devices with high energy density. The electrophoretic deposition technique was developed to fabricate multi-layered graphene/Si–CuO QDs, as shown in Fig. 3d.34 Although the capacity of silicon is more than ten times that of existing graphite anodes, the application of silicon anodes is limited due to their large volume changes during cycling. However, multi-layered structures can have a buffer effect on the volume expansion. Interlayer Cu3Si was formed after annealing, which could increase the conductivity and reduce the damage caused by the drastic volume change of Si. Fig. 3e shows the capability of the LIB assembled with this electrode under different current densities. Although the electrochemical performance of energy storage devices has been improved, their capability rate and cycling performance still need to be enhanced. Considering the agglomeration and poor conductivity of CuO QDs, they were combined with 1D carbon fiber with good conductivity via a feasible electrospinning method, as shown in Fig. 3f.35 A desirable performance in the SIB could be achieved due to the shorter ionic diffusion length and fast diffusion kinetics. The SIB assembled using the electrode combining 54% QDs with carbon fiber exhibited an initial reversible capacity of 528 mA h g−1, rate capability of 250 mA h g−1 at 5000 mA g−1, and capacity of 401 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 500 mA g−1.

3. Storage mechanisms and electrochemical performance
3.1 Quantum dots compound carbonaceous materials
There have been intensive efforts to promote the electrochemical performance of quantum dot materials by coupling them with carbonaceous materials. The unique hierarchical structure of QDs compounded with other materials is advantageous for enlarging the electrode/electrolyte interface area and enhancing the electrochemical activity of the hybrid materials, inhibiting the particle aggregation of QDs and accommodating their volume change during the charging–discharging process. In addition, this type of structure has many effects on the integral device characteristics, such as good mechanical properties, increased conductivity, widened layer spacing of layered materials, high density of active sites provided by the large specific surface area, strong affinity with Li+ and Na+, widened potential window and fast diffusion kinetics. Besides, redox-active QDs can also be decorated on the surface of conductive 1D and 2D materials to prevent their aggregation and maintain high energy storage capacities.

As a key member of the carbon family, graphene with a two-dimensional atom monolayer has attracted widespread attention because of its large surface area of over 2600 m2 g−1, high carrier mobility, superior mechanical strength, and excellent flexibility. The main methods for the preparation of graphene include mechanical peeling method,96 SiC epitaxial growth method,97 graphite oxide reduction method,98 and chemical vapor deposition method.99 Thus, coupling QD compounds with graphene has become the main solution to overcome the agglomeration of QDs and their poor electronic conductivity. Furthermore, the introduction of another functional substance into the resulting composite not only act can as a substantial physical barrier to separate graphene nanosheets from each other, but also function to endow the resulting composite with significantly enhanced lithium storage capability. Accordingly, a large library of QDs has been successfully combined with graphene through a lot of synthetic strategies. Transition metal oxides can be used as one of the alternative materials for commercial graphite because of their high theoretical capacity (>600 mA h g−1). However, they suffer from poor conductivity and serious volume expansion, which is associated with ion (Li and Na) insertion/extraction.
Thus the use of graphene can both increase the conductivity and enlarge the surface area of electrodes, as well as buffer the strain from the volume change of metal oxides during the discharge/charge processes. For example, Peng et al. synthesized well-dispersed CoO QDs anchored on graphene nanosheets through a facile ultrasonic method at room temperature as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries (Fig. 4a).82 The ultrasonic reaction involves a two-step reaction mechanism, where under ultrasonication, Co is generated on the graphene nanosheets via the decomposition of Co4(CO)12 (Co4(CO)12–4Co + 12CO) and then Co oxidization in situ to CoO through the dissolved O2 in solution (Step II) (2Co + O2–2CoO). Co or CoO can firmly anchor on the graphene because of the electrostatic attraction between the electron-rich Co atoms and electron-unsaturated carbon atoms, which enhances the conjunction stability of the hybrids. This composite supplied not only a large quantity of accessible active sites, but also good conductivity and short diffusion length for Li+. In the CV test, the peak positions moved from 0.7 V and 0.43 V to 1.3 V and 2.2 V, and tended to be stable because of the formation of an SEI and decomposition of the electrolyte. This was also confirmed by the results of the cycling performance (the initial capacity of about 1746 mA h g−1 during the first discharge process, and a low charge capacity of 980 mA h g−1). Interestingly, they further revealed that the reversible capacities showed an upward trend with an increase in the number of cycles, as shown in Fig. 4b. The possible reasons for this are that during the cycling process, the crystallized CoO gradually becomes amorphous, which means that an increasing number of accessible active sites was available for Li+ ion insertion, even though the conductivity of the hybrids decreased during the cycling processes. Therefore, the composite electrode demonstrated a high lithium storage capacity (1592 mA h g−1 in the 50th cycle), excellent cycling performance, and rate capability (1008 mA h g−1 when the discharge current increased 20 times to 1000 mA g−1). Besides, a novel and simple strategy for the synthesis of TiO2 QD/graphene nanosheet composites in a water-in-oil emulsion system was further developed to produce a high-performance anode material for LIBs, as shown in Fig. 4c.26

The well-dispersed TiO2 quantum dots (TiO2-QDs) anchored firmly on the GNs, and thus could inhibit aggregation and offer a direct short pathway for Li+ diffusion. Besides, combining with graphene can further retain the advantages and address the issues of poor the electronic conductivity of the TiO2 material and slow Li-ion diffusion in electrodes. Consequently, the composite exhibited a high capacity of 190 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 1C (1C = 182 mA g−1) even after 100 charge–discharge cycles, which is higher than the theoretical capacity (168 mA h g−1) of anatase TiO2. The possible reason for the higher capacity can be attributed to the formation of cubic LiTiO2 with a higher lithium storage capacity in the TiO2 QDs due to the quantum-size confinement effect. Also, the good dispersity and strong binding between the QDs and the graphene support will further lead to excellent cycling and rate performances. Liu et al. further developed Fe3O4 quantum dots with an average size of 4.9 nm on the surface of 3D structured graphene nanosheets homogeneously via a facile one-pot hydrothermal approach as an anode material for SIBs, as shown in Fig. 4d.36 The uniformly dispersed QDs and good volume tolerance improved the cycling stability (312 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 50 mA g−1) for the SIB. It is worth mentioning that the initial capacity of the 3D–0D graphene-Fe3O4 QD hybrids in the discharging process was 779 mA h g−1, which is much higher than the sum of the capacity of pure Fe3O4 (416 mA h g−1) and pure graphene (237.3 mA h g−1), indicating the improved electrochemical activity of the hybrids. Therefore, the composites exhibited excellent sodium storage capacity (525 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1), and superior rate performances (56 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1). A facile, scalable, and one-step thermal decomposition method was designed to synthesize Fe2O3 QDs decorated on functionalized graphene sheets (FGS) with oxygen functional groups, as shown in Fig. 4e.101 The large surface areas of 216.5, 208.0, and 198.5 m2 g−1 and good electrical conductivity were exhibited by the 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1 Fe2O3/FGS composites, respectively, which will endow the electrodes with promising electrochemical performances. The ideal capacitance behavior was reflected in the shape of the CV curves, which maintained a rectangular shape without distortion at different scan rates, as shown in Fig. 4f. An MnO2/FGS composite was synthesized as a cathode material by a similar thermal decomposition method to fabricate asymmetric supercapacitors. The almost coincident specific capacitance curves of Fe2O3/FGS and MnO2/FGS at different scan rates indicated that the MnO2/FGS composite electrode is a good match with the Fe2O3/FGS electrode. The asymmetric supercapacitor delivered an outstanding energy density, power density, and good cycling stability with 95% initial capacitance retention after 5000 cycles.
The application of QDs has also been extended to other components of energy storage devices. Mo2C QD@graphene was reported as a functionalized separator for Li–S batteries, as shown in Fig. 5a.102 Through DFT calculations, it was found that the presence of Mo2C QDs increases the interaction between graphite and Li+ ions. When Li+ ion are intercalated, as shown in Fig. 5b, the carbon atoms on the Mo2C QDs and graphene will form Li+ traps, thereby providing more channels for the diffusion of Li+ in the electrolyte to achieve uniform Li deposition, avoiding the formation of lithium dendrites. The strong and stable adsorption of polysulfides by Mo2C QDs also effectively prevents the sulfide shuttle phenomenon. Consequently, the Li–S battery exhibited a high capacity of 1230 mA h g−1 at 0.2C and high rate of 2C for 400 cycles with a low capacity fading of 0.045% per cycle, as shown in Fig. 5c. QD and graphite composites have also been applied as cathodes. As shown in Fig. 5d, V2O5 QDs were uniformly anchored on graphene sheets through two steps of nucleation and growth.39 This structure provides more active sites and a shorter Li+ transfer distance, and buffers the volume pressure of V2O5 QDs when Li+ is intercalated and deintercalated. Therefore, the device using V2O5 QD/graphene showed a capacity of 245 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and cycle stability for 300 cycles with 89% capacity retention. Besides, a periodic QD/carbonaceous array nanohybrid material prepared via the electrophoresis method was also applied as a cathode. A binder-free vertical nanosheet array of graphene QDs/VO2 was reported, as shown in Fig. 5e.88 A VO2 nanobelt array provided a short diffusion distance for Li+ and Na+ and was also conducive for electrolyte penetration. Graphene QDs provide more venues for storing Li+ and Na+ ions and protect the materials inside. Thus, using this material as a cathode in LIB and SIB, a capacity of 420 mA h g−1 and 306 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 was obtained and cycle stability of 94% and 88% after 1500 cycles at 18 A g−1 were obtained, respectively. Subsequently, a binder-free vertical nanosheet array of graphene QD/FeF3·0.33H2O was synthesized through a similar method.89 Besides improving the overall electrical conductivity of the electrode, the graphene QDs protect the electrode material from excessive exposure to the electrolyte and generate a thin SEI film to avoid the generation of non-conductive FeF3−x·0.33H2O, thereby protecting the electrode material during the charging and discharging process. Therefore, a capacity of 96 mA h g−1 was maintained after 1000 cycles at 2C for the LIB. Furthermore, N-doped graphene QDs/Li4Ti5O12 (ref. 85) and graphene QD/Na3(VO)2(PO4)2F@C nanocuboids87 as cathodes were also reported, where the graphene QDs stabilized the electrode structure and increased the electrical conductivity during the operation of the devices.

It is also effective and economical to combine QDs with graphene oxide (GO) or reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to form new electrode materials. Tin-based materials always suffer from dislocation, plasticity, cracking, pulverization, and continuous formation of an SEI film, leading to low coulombic efficiency (ICE) and a rapid deterioration in cyclability. Thud, a facile route was developed to synthesize SnO2 QD@GO with a high mass loading, where the weight percentage of SnO2 QDs in the composite was 87.7%, as shown in Fig. 6a.79 During the hydrothermal process, Sn2+ can be in situ oxidized by the rich functional groups of GO, and then heterogeneously nucleate and grow on the surface of GO, while the GO is reduced to a flake-like hybrid structure. It was found that when the functional groups on the graphene surface were rich, more nucleation sites of Sn2+ were provided, and thereby a uniform and random distribution of QDs on the GO nanosheets could be achieved. In situ TEM analysis of the sample after 100 cycles shows its excellent structural integrity. Thus, SnO2 QD@GO exhibits a promising performance as an anode for LIBs in terms of high capacity and outstanding cycling stability. Dual carbon-confined Co9S8 QDs were also synthesized via the thermal-induced reduction, carbonization, and vulcanization of GO-wrapped ZIFs precursors, where the GO sheets were reduced to 3D RGO and the ZIFs converted into Co9S8 QDs and porous carbon, as can be seen in Fig. 6b.81 Therefore, the formed RGO and carbon can provide a double-confined nanospace to release the volume expansion of the Co9S8 QDs during Na+ insertion and extraction.

The special structure of Co9S8 QD/carbon not only provides multiple channels for the diffusion of Na+ through the host crystalline lattice, but also gives different chemical-bonding-breaking routes during the discharge and charge process. The lattice parameters for Co9S8 QD@RGO were slightly larger than that of the sample without RGO, which may be beneficial for facilitating fast charge transport and Na+ intercalation and extraction. The surface defects introduced by pyrrolic N and pyridinic N can promote multiple channels for Na+ diffusion. Tin selenide (SnSe2) as an electrode material always suffers from severe capacity degradation after 30 cycles, mainly because of the generation of irreversible Li2Se. Thus, achieving the reversibility for Li2Se is an important strategy to improve the capacity and cycle performance of LIBs for SnSe2-based materials. Hybrid composites of SnSe2 QDs embedded in the 3D matrix of RGO were designed to address the issues of SnSe2-based materials for LIBs (Fig. 6c).47 The release of fine Sn nanoparticles during the conversion of SnSe2 could catalyze the decomposition of Li2Se, and consequently drove the formation of SnSe2, which resulted in the capacities of SnSe2 QDs being greater than their theoretical capacity (426 mA h g−1) through alloy/dealloying reactions. Simultaneously, through the comparison of SnSe2 nanoplates, it was revealed that the morphology has a great influence on the performance of LIBs, mainly where the Sn nanoparticles formed can promote the lithiation catalysis and the reversible transformation of Li2Se.
In addition to being widely used in the anodes of batteries, QD-carbonaceous materials have gradually been used in cathodes. For instance, free-standing iodine QDs decorated on RGO as a cathode for SIBs were synthesized via a “concentration gradient” two-step process.80 Since iodine readily dissolves in the electrolyte, its combination with graphite is a very suitable approach. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to confirm the sites where Na+ ions may be intercalated in the iodine material, as shown in Fig. 6d. Through the intercalation energy calculation of six sites (A–F), it was found that intercalation energies of the E and F sites are the lowest where the Na+ ion is most easily intercalated. When a unit cell is intercalated with eight Na ions, the theoretical capacity is 211 mA h g−1 with 39.5% volume expansion. RGO exhibits strong adsorption for iodide because of the rich functional groups on its surface, which prevents the dissolution of iodide ions in the electrolyte. The discharging and charge processes are 2Na+ + 3I2 + 2e− → 2NaI3 and 3NaI → 2Na+ + NaI3 + 2e−, respectively, with the discharge process being faster than the charging process. In addition, Teng et al. used graphene oxide QDs to enhance the Li+ ion mobility of a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) for LIBs.93 The graphene oxide QDs not only inhibited the formation of ion-solvent clusters, which impede ion transport in the electrolyte and obstruct ion transfer, but also immobilized PF6− anions, which can promote the formation of space-charge layers. Thus, the GPE exhibited high ionic conductivity and high Li+-ion transference number (0.77). Consequently, the battery assembled with this electrolyte showed capacity values of 155 and 52 mA h g−1 at rates of 0.1 and 20C, respectively. This capacity did not decrease after 500 charge–discharge cycles at 5C.


3.1.2 Carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers. 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a promising electrode material because of their high electric conductivity, large surface area and strong mechanical flexibility.1,103 Thus, pre-synthesized CdS QDs were grafted onto the surface of CNTs via a chemical precipitation approach, where the QDs were encapsulated in the narrow channels of the CNTs, as shown in Fig. 7a.91 The obtained QDs exhibited good dispersibility and uniform size due to the limited growth and prevention of agglomeration by the coating with organic ligands during the synthesis. Besides, organic ligands are more conducive for the adsorption of CdS QDs on the surface of CNTs because of the electrostatic interactions. The nanostructure also exhibited a high surface area, which provides multiple polar sites to anchor polysulfides, improve the reaction kinetics and inhibit the irreversible loss of polysulfides during the charging-discharging process. In addition, Cd is likely to react with unreacted S to form CdSn (1 ≤ n ≤ 8), which exhibits high immobilization of the polysulfide and catalytic activity. Moreover, the nano-gate formed by anchored QDs in the narrow channel of CNTs can be a blocking to prevent the shuttle of polysulfides. Consequently, this unique structure demonstrated a good rate and cycle performance in a lithium–sulfide battery.

Inlaying MnO QDs into walls of hetero-nanotubes to form a new composite showed great potential as electrode materials in both LIBs and SIBs, as shown in Fig. 7b.31 Owing to the heterojunction at the interface between QDs and CNTs, the quantum dot effect changes the planar structure of carbon and the density of local electron clouds, improving the adsorption capacity of cations, thereby facilitating the transfer and storage of Li+ and Na+ ions. Besides good conductivity and fast ion and electron transmission, MnO QDs can be inlaid and dispersed in the carbon matrix, expanding the layer spacing of CNTs, which is even larger than that of pure graphite. Therefore, this electrode has a greater tolerance to the insertion and deintercalation of Li+ and Na+ ions, and thus the device can maintain better coulomb efficiency and cycling stability in LIBs and SIBs.
The ineffective reuse of intermediate products (LiPSs) of polysulfides is the main limitation that hinders the performance improvement of lithium–sulfur batteries. Accordingly, BP can chemically bind with LiPSs and convert them immediately into Li2S (Fig. 7c).90 The edges sites of BP can trap LiSPs to prevent their diffusion, and thus reducing the size of BP bulk to the nanoscale (BP QDs) will be a promising choice because the area of the exposed edges of BP QDs (4.5 nm) accounts for 52.6% of their whole surface, which is larger than that of BP flakes. BP QDs are beneficial for the 3D precipitation of Li2S because of the strong adsorption via both P–S and P–Li bonds, and rapidly converted into LiPSs due to the stronger catalytic effect of BP QDs than BP flakes. Due to the effective immobilization of LiSPs, higher redox reaction kinetics, and high electrical conductivity, sulfur particles with porous carbon nanofiber (PCNF)/S/BP QD electrodes with a high sulfur loading of 8 mg cm−2 and a low E/S ratio of ∼6.5 mL g−1 delivered an areal capacity of 4.4 mA h cm−2 after 200 cycles.
Various metal-carboxymethyl chitosan materials have been further applied to assemble corresponding metal oxide QD/carbon nanofiber composites for achieving high-performance LIBs and SIBs. For example, ultrafine metal oxides (Co3O4, Mn3O4, and Fe3O4) coupled in N-enriched 3D carbon nanofibers (MO@NCFs) were constructed with water-soluble carbonxymethyl chitosan as a nanofibrous template and 3D metal-polysaccharide coordination framework as a precursor of metal ions, as shown in Fig. 7e.65 After pyrolysis, freeze drying and carbonization, a 3D carbon-confined structure was constructed, which exhibited strong structural stability because of the strong crosslinking between the metal ions and polymer chains. Because of the robust structural stability, fast ion transport and electron conduction and abundant active sites, the 3D Co3O4@NCFs showed a high Li+ and Na+ storage capacity of 721 mA h g−1 and 301 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 after 400 cycles, respectively. Transition metal phosphides possess high theoretical capacities; nevertheless, they suffer from poor rate performances and stability due to their volume expansion and low conductivity. FeP QDs confined in P-doped 3D octahedral carbon framework/CNTs (FeP@OCF/CNTs), which were assembled via the reductive phosphatization/carbonization of a metal–organic framework (MIL-101), could buffer the volume expansion and improve the conductivity, as shown in Fig. 7f.48 At high currents, the porous carbon structure provides more surface area to store interface charges. Simultaneously, the QDs provide a short Na+ diffusion distance and fast charge transfer. Consequently, both the plateau capacity and slope capacity contribute to the record high-rate capability (262 mA h g−1@20 A g−1) at high currents. A full SIB cell was further assembled using FeP@OCF as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode, which demonstrated promising electrochemical performances with a tiny volume changes.
A flexible free-standing electrode was prepared, in which well-dispersed MnO QDs with the average size of 2–5 nm were attached tightly on a highly conductive CNT substrate and covered by N-doped carbon layers, as shown in Fig. 7d.100 A slope was observed at 1.0–2.2 V and 1.5–0.5 V in the CV curves, which confirmed that the Mn2+ was readily oxidized to a higher valence state, introducing extra capacity in the cycling process. This is due to the small size of the nanoparticles and slow reaction kinetics of the MnO QDs. Consequently, the hybrid as an anode exhibited an ultrahigh capacity, outstanding rate capability, and long cycling stability in an LIB.
Applying QD/CNT composite materials in the separator can trap the soluble polysulfides beyond the electrode, thereby buffering the shuttle effect of Li–S batteries. Thus, a modified separator by coating multiwall carbon nanotubes/N-doped carbon QDs (MWCNTs/NCQDs) on one side of the commercial PP separator was designed, as shown in Fig. 7g.104 This structure of porous MWCNT network/NCQDs can achieve physical and chemical adsorption of polysulfides. The existence of oxygen-functional groups and N atoms in NCQDs facilitates the adsorption of polysulfides. Therefore, the self-discharge issue of the rechargeable Li–S battery was effectively alleviated. Consequently, the device showed an initial discharge capacity of 1330.8 mA h g−1 and retained 507.9 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 0.5C with a corresponding capacity fade rate as low as 0.05% per cycle. Then, TiO2 QD-decorated multi-walled carbon nanotubes as a multifunctional separator was also reported, as shown in Fig. 7h.105 The difference is that ALD was used to deposit the TiO2 QDs on the multi-walled carbon nanotubes.


3.1.3 Other carbon-based composites. 
QDs combined with carbon spherical structures have become an important electrode structure. This designed structure enables more surface area and can effectively suppress the volume changes during ion insertion/extraction. Nano-sized graphene QDs (GQDs) enriched with oxygen functional groups were introduced in sulfur cathodes to enhance the utilization of sulfur/sulfide.106 As can be seen in Fig. 8a, the GQDs were distributed on the sulfur particles, which contained both the hydrophobic aromatic and hydrophilic defective regions, leading to a densely packed GQD-S/CB composite structure with enhanced conductivity and shortened electron conduction paths. Because of the formed C–S bonding generated during the discharge and charge process, the amount of active material dissolved in the electrolyte decreased. Therefore, the hybrid as an electrode exhibited improved cycling and rate performances for the lithium–sulfur battery. Amorphous ZnO QDs were also synthesized via the CVD method, which were encapsulated in an amorphous carbon matrix anchored on the shell of mesoporous carbon bubbles, exhibiting better electronic conductivity and faster charge transfer compared with the commercial ZnO, a shown in Fig. 8b.107 The electrode delivered a reversible capacity of nearly 930 mA h g−1 (at a current density of 100 mA g−1) with more than 90% retention for 85 cycles.

Metal sulfide is more conducive to sodiation and desodiation reactions because of the weaker M–S bond, which is weaker than the M–O bond in metal oxides.108 Accordingly, tin sulfides (SnS2 and SnS) are prominent and potential alternatives electrodes for SIBs.10 SnS has a stable integral structure and exhibits a smaller phase transformation during the charge and discharge process.109 The SnS bulk material was further made into SnS QDs and combined with carbon materials, which not only maintained a high capacity and high electrical conductivity, but also prevented a greater surface area of the QDs from being exposed to the electrolyte. For example, ultra-small SnS QDs anchored on nitrogen-enriched carbon nanospheres were prepared as a promising anode material for SIBs (Fig. 8c).45 Compared with the pristine SnS electrode, the SnS QD@N-doped carbon electrode demonstrated the same types of peaks in the CV curve. In addition, the peaks were well defined with a reduced overpotential and the curves coincided well in subsequent cycles, indicating that this hybrid structure has excellent stability. The morphology of the materials after 200 cycles was analyzed by FE-SEM, and it was found that the sample of pure SnS QDs had obvious cracks, whereas there was no obvious change in the SnS QD@N-doped carbon. Another material, namely vanadium nitride QDs uniformly embedded within porous shells of N-doped carbon hollow spheres (VN QD@NC HSs) with a thickness of 40 nm, was reported as a potential electrode for LIBs (Fig. 8d).63 The abundant microporous and mesoporous structural features are beneficial for electrolyte penetration and fast ion transmission. During the lithiation and delithiation process, VN QD@NC HSs could maintain a stable structure compared with the VN-bulk particles, where the pulverization and fragmentation repeatedly exposed the VN surfaces to the electrolyte solvent. It is worth mentioning that the device composed of this structure is mainly controlled by surface pseudocapacitive reactions. The diffusion coefficients of Li+ of VN QD@NC HSs was calculated to be 1.15 × 10−11, which is two to three orders of magnitude greater than that of the VN/N-doped carbon nanoparticles and VN-bulk N-doped carbon particles. The composite also yielded remarkable sodium-ion storage properties. Co0.85Se QDs homogenously embedded in carbon petal flakes were further reported as an electrode for KIBs, as shown in Fig. 8e.70 The reduction potential (0.5 V) of the Co0.85Se-QD/carbon electrode was higher than the plating voltage of K metal (0.01 V), which can avoid the formation of metal dendrites and improve the safety of KIBs. Besides, the DFT analysis revealed that the substitution reactions for K ions from Co7Se8 into Co and K3Co4Se8 are energetically favorable. Moreover, the existence of Co 3p orbital electrons in Co0.85Se can be regarded as a metal conductor, which is beneficial for the transmission of electrons and good rate performance. Therefore, the Co0.85Se-QDs/C composites possessed a capacity of 402 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 100 cycles with a relatively high efficiency of approximately 99%.
A composite of ZnO-QDs anchored in amorphous carbon multilayered sheets (ZnO-QD@CMS) was synthesized as an electrode for LIBs via the carbonization of glycolate moieties and transfer of ZnO QDs embedded in ultrathin amorphous carbon layers by annealing, as shown in Fig. 9a.61 Compared with the pristine ZnO spheres, the ZnO QDs were only accompanied by 3.26% volume expansion during the charge and discharge process. Also, in this process, no Zn crystals were found in the ZnO-QD@CMS, indicating that the Zn atoms were effectively converted into LixZny during the reaction process, rather than the stable and irreversible elemental Zn. A CoSx (CoS and Co9S8)-embedded N/S-doped carbon nanosheets (CoSx@NSC) heterostructure was reported with enhanced structural stability via a one-step method, as shown in Fig. 9b.42 Through AFM characterization, it was observed that the surface spacing of the carbon layer was less than 1 nm, indicating that the CoSx QDs embedded in the carbon layer were very small. Because of the large specific surface area, the surface capacity accounted for 50% of the total capacity. Besides, the coulomb efficiency and capacity of the device could be greatly improved by the formation of a reversible SEI film. Consequently, the hybrid material exhibited a rate capability of 600 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and 500 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1, cycling stability of 87% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1 A g−1 and full-cell performance of 414 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1.

3D porous inverse opal-structured carbon encapsulating QDs is another effective strategy to improve the capacity and stability of SIBs, where silica nanospheres were used as the template, transition metal oleate, and thiourea as the TM and QD precursor, respectively. For example, Co9S8 QDs well wrapped by thin carbon shells with a thickness of 1–2 nm were developed as electrode materials for SIBs (Fig. 9c).67 Compared with Co9S8-QD@N-doped carbon (Co9S8 QD@NC), this 3D ordered microporous Co9S8-QD@N-doped carbon (3DOM Co9S8-QD@NC) exhibited an improved capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability, which is attributed to the enhanced affinity of the electrolyte, increased contact sites between the QDs and the electrolyte and more electron conductive channels from the heteroatom doping defects. Taking advantage of nanostructures and microstructures, nanocomposites can significantly improve the structural and electrical integrity, and exhibit good ion transport and electron transfer dynamics in SIBs. By replacing the Co-oleate precursor with an Fe-oleate precursor, a new composite of FeS QDs embedded in a three-dimensional (3D) inverse opal (IO)-structured N-doped carbon (3D-IO FeS-QD@NC) was prepared, as shown in Fig. 9e.66 This structure provides sufficient space and channels for volume expansion and electrolyte penetration. Therefore, the energy storage device exhibited outstanding cycling stability over 2500 cycles.
A 3D ordered porous N-doped carbon framework with 2–5 nm-sized Ge QDs uniformly embedded (3DOP Ge@NC) as a binder-free anode for LIBs was proposed to solve the issue of structural collapse and insufficient capacity of Ge bulk-based materials, as shown in Fig. 9d.50 The presence of the 3D ordered porous N-doped carbon framework can effectively enhance the structural stability and capacity retention due to the loose particle stacking and prevents the active aggregation of Ge. Besides, the designed structure can also maintain the generation of the quantum size-limiting effect on Li storage and reduce the energy barrier for Li+ ion transfer. Moreover, the formation of a uniform and stable SEI layer around the carbon skeleton can further protect the alloying reaction and restrict the volume changes. Consequently, the 3DOP Ge@NC anode with a high areal mass loading (82.92 wt%, 8 mg cm−2) exhibited long-term high-rate cycling stability (with the capacity retention of 90% after 1200 cycles even at 5 A g−1) and areal capacity (3980 mA h cm−2 at 80 mA cm−2) with an initial CE of 32.7%. It is worth highlighting that the full cell assembled with 3DOP Ge@NC as the anode and commercial LiFePO4 (LFP) as the cathode presented a high specific capacity and favorable cycling stability. In addition to the 3D carbon framework, the application of carbon QDs in the electrolyte and cathodes has also attracted widespread attention. A novel solid-state polymer electrolyte was reported, where carbon QDs were introduced in the poly(ethylene oxide) matrix.94 When a battery was assembled using this electrolyte, it showed ionic conductivities of 1.39 × 10−4 and 7.17 × 10−5 S cm−1, respectively. The cathode materials of carbon QD/VO2 interwoven nanowires92 and carbon QD/Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (ref. 110) were also successfully synthesized.
Multivalent metal cations in multivalent ion batteries can carry more charges, which can provide more electricity than lithium and sodium-ion batteries.111,112 However, since multivalent metal batteries are still in their infancy, there are only a few examples of the application of QDs, but the existing references prove the potential of QDs in multivalent metal batteries. It was reported that when the particle size of Chevrel phases, which act as the cathode material in multi-ion batteries, is reduced to five times smaller than the original size, the capacity increases by 5%. Also, an article calculated the adsorption energy of AlCl4− ions at different sites on the surface of graphene QDs. The smaller GQDs possess a stronger adsorption energy, and hence a higher voltage. As the cathode of AIBs, it was found that graphene QDs have a higher voltage window than graphite.113 Besides, it has been proven that shortening the magnesium-ion diffusion distance is an effective strategy to promote the ion insertion kinetics, and nanomaterials can effectively release the mechanical pressure caused by volume expansion.114,115 It is believed that with the continuous breakthrough and development of new technologies, QD materials can inject more vitality into the multivalent metal battery and energy market.

3.2 Carbon-coated clusters
Metal oxides with high capacity and low cost have attracted much attention as promising materials for energy storage devices.103 However, the low CE, poor cycling performance, and low power density of energy storage devices, and huge volume expansion remain the main challenges that have to be solved before metal oxides can be utilized as effective electrodes. Thus, intensive works have been conducted to mitigate these issues.
The synthesis of QD nanocrystals is one of the major approaches to boost the electrochemical performances of materials by increasing their specific surface area, which can reach more than 2000 m2 g−1 for porous carbon and graphene and is between 100 and 1000 m2 g−1 for most nanomaterials.4 Nonetheless, the extremely high surface area and highly reactive QDs induce undesirable chemical reactions, resulting in a poor cycling performance. Thus, combining QDs into nanoclusters or aggregates can be an effective approach to inhibit their undesirable chemical reactions. This approach can greatly reduce the surface area of QDs exposed to the electrolyte, but also retains the nanoscale dimensions of QDs, which can provide a short diffusion distance for ions.116,117 For example, mesoporous clusters of SnO2 QDs wrapped with RGO sheets as anodes for LIBs were reported, as shown in Fig. 10a.118 The RGO layer provides both an effective barrier against excessive electrolyte and high electrical conductivity. These composites reduced the diffusion distance for Li ions, reinforced the electronic conductivity, and restrained the excessive formation of an SEI. Consequently, a high reversible capacity of 924 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1, and excellent rate performance, reaching 240 mA h g−1 at 3000 mA g−1 were obtained when an RGO-wrapped mesoporous SnO2 QD cluster composite was used as the anode to assemble an LIB. Besides, Gao et al. developed hybrids of CoS QD nanoclusters uniformly anchored on graphene nanosheets via a two-step hydrothermal strategy, as shown in Fig. 10b.83 This material provided strong structural stability, rapid ion and electron transfer paths, and an excellent conductive network owing to the robust interfacial connection between CoS and graphene.

Interestingly, the PIB assembled with the composite material of CoS QD@graphene as an electrode exhibited an unprecedented capacity of 310.8 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 after 100 cycles, with a rate capability of 232.3 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 4C (1C = 1 A g−1), which was better than that of the SIB assembled with the same material. This work further demonstrates that CoS has great potential for the intercalation and deintercalation of K+ ions in PIBs. Ma et al. further reported a mulberry-like architecture self-assembled by Fe2O3 QDs as an anode for LIBs, as shown in Fig. 10c. The mulberry structure retained dominant pseudocapacitance behavior and enabled high electrochemical activity.78 Also, the strong chemical bonding between the conductive rGO substrate and Fe2O3 particles and the effective electrical contact between the primary nanocrystals provide a stable electrical highway. It was revealed that the pseudocapacitance contributed 80.6% of the entire capacity (1383.8 mA h g−1) at 0.4 mV s−1. The pseudocapacitance characteristic enabled rapid diffusion kinetics to achieve an excellent rate capacity (558.3 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1). In addition, the reduced SEI and the decreased side reactions by the mulberry structure resulted in a better CE and outstanding cycling stability compared to the individual Fe2O3 QDs.
4. Summary and perspective
This review summarized the application of QDs in rechargeable batteries, specifically LIBs, SIBs, KIBs, LSBs and supercapacitors. The main focus was the preparation of material composites, micro/nanostructures, and their electrochemical performances. The functionalization of the surface of QDs can improve the electrochemical performances of energy storage devices. The structural composition, crystallization process, surface chemistry and other characteristics of particles are crucial to improve the performance of QD-based devices. At present, only some preliminary characterization of QDs can be completed, which requires more ingenious experimental designs or more sophisticated advanced equipment for further research. To realize the fully controllable mass production of QDs, ALD and laser irradiation can be used as a deposition tool. ALD is proven to be effective in preparing QD electrodes over a large area. The laser method can prevent the agglomeration of the QDs due to the electrostatic charge effect without the addition of surface organic ligands. Modification of surface functional groups will change the electrochemical properties of QDs, thereby affecting their performance in rechargeable batteries, besides adjusting the growth and preventing the agglomeration of QDs. The performance of QD-based devices is far from the theoretical value. In addition to the interface control of the device to improve its performance, it is necessary to strengthen the device structure innovation and mining of the charge storage mechanism, including surface-based ion adsorption, pseudocapacitance, and diffusion-limited intercalation processes, and in-depth exploration of the properties of material and optimization of the device preparation process.
