    , Accepted 2nd September 2016First published on 2nd September 2016AbstractElectric field induced effects have attracted considerable interest in the field of perovskite materials and solar cells because they are closely related to the performance and stability. In this work, we visualize and characterize the electric field induced effects in laterally structured Au/FTO/CH3NH3PbI3/FTO/Au samples via photoluminescence optical microscopy, in situ time-correlated single photon counting measurements and scanning electron microscopy. Both irreversible and reversible responses are observed under different electric fields and humidity conditions. Firstly, the irreversible response near both electrodes includes permanent photoluminescence quenching and morphology changes. Such changes are observed when the applied field is larger than a nominal value, which depends on the humidity conditions. The irreversible change is a result of perovskite decomposition, which is indicated by the appearance of a PbI2 peak in the localized photoluminescence spectrum. We show that this moisture-assisted electric field induced decomposition can be minimized by encapsulation. Secondly, a reversible response near the anode observed under a weak electric field, which is characterized by photoluminescence quenching and a reduced lifetime with negligible morphology change, is attributed to the migration and accumulation of mobile ions. The dominant mobile species is ascribed to be iodide ions by mobility calculations. Thirdly, a slowdown of the irreversible response, i.e., decomposition within the bulk of the perovskite and away from the electrodes, is observed. This is because of the negative feedback between perovskite decomposition and ion accumulation, which offsets the field induced effect in the perovskite bulk. This work demonstrates the effective use of photoluminescence microscopy revealing different mechanisms behind the observed instability of perovskite devices under different bias and moisture conditions that cause either reversible or irreversible changes.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells with rapid progress in power conversion efficiencies have emerged in recent years.1–4 It is promising to overcome the price barrier of PV electricity by combining both potential low cost materials and high efficiency.5 However, the instability of perovskite solar cells is still a major hurdle for the technology to be commercially viable. Slow responses under an electrical bias, such as the hysteresis effect, are unique issues for perovskites and are closely related to device performance and stability. Hysteresis has been widely investigated in perovskite solar cells,6–16 and different mechanisms have been suggested. The ferroelectric effect, although it has been suggested, is an unlikely reason for hysteresis7,17 in CH3NH3PbI3 due to a different timescale of these slow responses and a lack of ferroelectric hysteresis at low temperatures.7,18,19 Simple capture and release of photo-generated charges in the bulk or interfacial defects are also unlikely causes due to the magnitude and duration of the changes in the photocurrent observed during relaxation after biasing.6 Qiu and his colleagues performed electric field dependent photoluminescence (PL) on a capacitor-like structured sample and assigned the PL responses with an applied field to the first and second order Stark effect.20 This effect, however, cannot explain the spontaneous switching of PL modulation behavior on a timescale of 1–10 s, which is consistent with ion (via defect6,21–23) migration.7,20 More studies proposed ion migration as the origin of the slow responses in perovskite.9,23–27 Dualeh et al. conducted impendence spectroscopy analysis on methylammonium lead iodide perovskite solar cells and suggested the presence of ionic charge transport in hybrid perovskite materials apart from electronic conduction.28 Zhao et al. reported band bending near the interface due to ion accumulation. The slow responses are also related to the decomposition of the perovskite material.29,30 Yuan and his colleagues confirmed the formation of PbI2 in their CH3NH3PbI3 film after electrical biasing using X-ray diffraction analysis, which they attributed to the decomposition of perovskite.29 By mapping the spatial distribution of the elements (C, Pb and I) Leijtens et al. attributed the concentration variations to the degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 during biasing, which eventually decomposed to PbI2, I− and CH3NH3+.30 More recently, researchers have proposed that the response could be either reversible or irreversible depending on the applied field and the environmental conditions,30–32 although the mechanisms are still controversial and the occurring conditions remain open to discussion.
The effects of the slow responses (especially ion migration) under an applied electric field on perovskite solar cells have been discussed and various mechanisms have been proposed, including a change in polarizability; an improvement of conductivity; a built-in field screening (and then a switchable photovoltaic effect) and ion induced doping.7,10,17,33–35 These findings suggested that a wide range of device architectures and electrode materials is possible in perovskite solar cells.24,36 On the other hand, the impact of electric field on carrier dynamics and instability (due to electric field induced decomposition) adversely affects the conversion efficiency and reliability of perovskite solar cells for long time operation.20,23,29,32,37,38
Further understanding is urgently required for pathways for eliminating the negative aspects of perovskite solar cells such as the instability problem. In this work, we visualize the electric field induced effect on laterally structured Au/FTO/CH3NH3PbI3/FTO/Au samples (where FTO is fluorine-doped tin oxide) via photoluminescence microscopy in conjunction with steady state and time-resolved measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A reversible PL quenching at the anode side with a negligible morphology change is observed under an electric field. In addition, permanent PL quenching and morphology changes are evident near the two electrodes when the applied field is larger than a nominal value, which in turn is dependent on the ambient humidity conditions. The reversible and irreversible responses are attributed to ion migration and moisture-assisted electric field induced decomposition, respectively, and are characterized by PL imaging for the first time. Localized PL spectra measurements showed the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite with evidence of a PbI2 peak in the PL spectra. This is one of the main causes for perovskite solar cell instability under operation where an electric bias is present under humid conditions. However, it can be minimized by encapsulation, which has also been shown in this work. Electric field driven ion migration and accumulation are also studied. The mobility of mobile ions was estimated and the dominant species is proposed to be iodide ions. The effect of ion accumulation on carrier dynamics was examined by comparing the PL lifetimes before and after biasing via in situ time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements. We also propose a negative feedback between decomposition and ion migration. The decomposition accelerates ion migration and accumulation, which however slows down the field-induced effect in the perovskite bulk.
Results and discussions
In this work, laterally structured samples with symmetrical electrodes were used, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The FTO layer on a glass substrate was etched away by a laser to form symmetrical electrodes with a ∼20 μm wide gap. A perovskite layer was then deposited on the etched FTO glass substrate. Finally, gold electrodes were sputtered through a mask onto the exposed FTO at both ends of the sample. The area measured or imaged is outlined by the dotted lines in Fig. 1a. Such a structure allows the monitoring of PL changes under an electrical bias across the area which is parallel to the direction of electric field through photoluminescence microscopy with an excitation laser wavelength of 488 nm (detailed sample fabrication and characterization methods are explained in the ESI†). To minimize sample degradation, the samples were transferred and stored in the dark and are kept away from moisture and oxygen between measurement sessions. Fig. 1b and c are the SEM image and PL image respectively that show the fairly uniform coverage of the CH3NH3PbI3 film between the two FTO electrodes before biasing. The steady state PL spectrum, see Fig. 1d, exhibits only one peak that originates from the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite (the long wavelength side was attenuated due to the low sensitivity of the detector in the near-infrared region39) and no PL peak can be observed from PbI2 at ∼500 nm.

The two blue lines indicate the region of the perovskite in the ∼20 μm wide gap between the FTO electrodes. 
To investigate the effect of electric field, a laterally structured sample was first biased with an electric field of 0.2 V μm−1, which was held constant for 3 minutes. The electric field was then removed for the sample to recover for 15 minutes. A higher electric field of 0.3 V μm−1 was then applied for 3 minutes followed by the removal of electric field for 15 minutes. This was repeated for different electric fields at 0.4 V μm−1, 0.5 V μm−1, … 0.7 V μm−1. In the case of 0.8 V μm−1, 0.9 V μm−1, a recovery time of one day (instead of 15 minutes) is required.
This experiment was performed in air with a relative humidity of ∼40%. PL images of the sample after each biasing and recovery process were acquired as shown in Fig. 2. When an electric field is smaller than 0.4 V μm−1, a 3 minute bias made very little change to the PL image, which almost completely recovered within 15 minutes after the removal of the bias; see Fig. 2a and b. Once the electrical bias exceeds 0.4 V μm−1, PL quenching could be evidently observed (see Fig. 2d–h). The quenching starts from the anode and “spreads” to the cathode. As the applied electric field increases up to 0.8 V μm−1, the quenching “spreads” faster and it is more difficult for the PL to recover. As shown in Fig. 2d–g, the sample only partially recovered after 15 minutes but eventually recovered after one day. When the electrical field is 0.9 V μm−1 (see Fig. 2h), the PL quenches across the whole area between the two electrodes. The areas near the electrodes cannot recover indefinitely. The reversible and irreversible responses observed under an applied field are consistent with recent reports.30,31 In addition, the reversible response occurs under any electric field while the irreversible changes occur when the field strength exceeds a nominal value, which is consistent with Jacobs' observation.31
 Fig. 2  PL images of the same sample biased as the electric field was progressively increased at (a) 0.2 V μm−1, (b) 0.3 V μm−1, (c) 0.4 V μm−1, (d) 0.5 V μm−1, (e) 0.6 V μm−1, (f) 0.7 V μm−1, (g) 0.8 V μm−1 and (h) 0.9 V μm−1. At each biasing, the electric field was held constant for 3 minutes. Between each biasing, the sample was allowed to recover for 15 minutes except for the 0.8 V μm−1 and 0.9 V μm−1 biasing, where the sample was allowed to recover for one day. The left image in each panel from (a) to (h) shows the PL image of the sample after a 3-minute bias while the right PL image is taken after 15 minutes of recovery (except for (g) and (h), in which each panel shows the results of one-day recovery). 
Irreversible response
It is important to highlight that the impact of electric field is dependent on the ambient moisture level. In order to explore the role of moisture, we compared the response of two samples biased by a constant field at 0.5 V μm−1 for 15 minutes. The longer biasing time was to observe the effect of prolonged biasing. One sample was pre-moisturized in a high humidity (RH ∼ 85%) environment in the dark for one hour before PL imaging. A control sample was not pre-moisturized and was kept under RH ∼ 40%. Fig. 3 shows the results for the pre-moisturized and control samples (see also videos in the ESI†).

PL images of the control sample (non-moisturized) (e) before and (f) after 15 minutes of biasing at 0.5 V μm−1. (g) SEM image of the non-moisturized sample after biasing. (d) PL intensity vs. bias time and (h) PL spectra (on 480–540 nm band) after biasing, of the two samples (red for pre-moisturized and blue for the control sample). 
Firstly, the quenching of PL in the pre-moisturized sample is immediate and rapid upon biasing. The quenching spread rapidly and covered the area between the electrodes (see Fig. 3d and Video S1, ESI†). The average PL intensity against biasing time is also measured, which dropped by more than 70% in 15 minutes. On the other hand, the response of the control sample is moderate and the PL quenching remained at the anode (see Fig. 3d and Video S2, ESI†). The PL intensity of the control sample only dropped by about 35%. Secondly, the morphology of the pre-moisturized sample varied remarkably compared to that of the control sample, according to SEM images (Fig. 3c and g). Destruction of the material by the electric field is evident from the pre-moisturized sample, while most of the control sample remained intact. We also checked the characteristic PL peak of PbI2 at around 510 nm,40–42 which is evident in the pre-moisturized sample (Fig. 3h) but was absent in the control sample.
The PL image and PL spectra were measured again for the two samples after one day of recovery. After recovery, PL quenching and the PbI2 peaks near the electrodes in the pre-moisturized sample were still observed (see Fig. 4) while the PL image of the control sample was recovered (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). It is evident that the irreversible response only occurred in the pre-moisturized sample even under same bias field. In combination with the first experiment, we conclude that the irreversible decomposition presents only if the field strength is over a threshold which is dependent on the moisture level. Our observation shows an irreversible change in CH3NH3PbI3 caused by moisture assisted electric field-induced material degradation which involves the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 as characterized by PL showing the presence of decomposition product PbI2.30

Insets in (b) and (d) show the zoomed PL spectra for wavelength range of 480–540 nm. 
To further investigate the role of moisture or the absence of moisture in the electric-field induced response, similar measurements were repeated on a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) protected sample. A higher bias 0.9 V μm−1 is applied for 3 minutes (which is comparable with the experiment shown in Fig. 2h). It is observed that PL quenching only happened near the anode and could be recovered after one day (Fig. S4, ESI†) showing the importance of cell encapsulation to avoid moisture-assisted electric field induced decomposition.
Apart from the irreversible response observed and discussed above, our PL imaging and measurements also show that an application of electric field can also result in changes in PL that is reversible. The causes of the reversible response are not due to material degradation as no PL peak of PbI2 can be observed but are very likely due to ion migration as observed in previous work that used conventional microscopic and electrical characterization.7,9,24,30 The PL quenching during the reversible response can be explained by enhanced non-radiative recombination induced by ion migration and accumulation, which in turn is set up by a bias. We will discuss this in the following paragraphs in detail.
Reversible response
In our experiments, the PL quenching always started near the anode and remained at the anode in the case of reversible response. Therefore, the possible ionic species accumulated near the anode in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite are I− ions6,43 or vacancies of methylammonium ion (MA+).22,24 The possibility of the vacancies of Pb2+ being an ionic species has been ruled out by Eames et al. due to the relatively low diffusion coefficient and high activation energy compared to I−.6
To verify the species type, the mobility of the mobile ion was determined from a series of 6 time-lapse PL images of the electrically biased (0.5 V μm−1) Au/FTO/CH3NH3PbI3/FTO/Au sample placed next to each other. These images were continuously acquired by uninterrupted scanning with a constant rate. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the blue lines mark the cathode and the anode. The gap between the +ve blue line and the yellow dotted line indicates the PL quenched region set up by the mobile negative ions as they accumulate near the anode with time. The PL quenched region reached a maximum at ∼t = 500 s. After such time, no further widening of the PL quenched region is observed (also shown in Video S2, ESI†). By considering ∼500 s as the necessary time for mobile negative ions to drift from the cathode to the PL quenched region (with a distance of ∼ 20 μm), it allows the estimation of the mobility (μ) of the ions using the equation μ = v/E, where v is the ion drifting velocity and E is the strength of the applied electric field. μ is estimated to be ∼8 × 10−10 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 0.5 V μm−1, which is very close to the value (1.5 × 10−9 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 1.5 V μm−1) estimated by Yuan et al. at a higher bias strength.24 Using the Einstein relationship (D = kT/q × μ), the ion diffusion coefficient (D) can be calculated to be ∼2.1 × 10−11 cm2 s−1. This value is close to the estimated value (10−12 cm2 s−1) for I− ions by Eames et al.6 Taking into account the low diffusion coefficient of MA+ and the very high activation energy of Pb2+,6 the dominant species for ion migration is most likely the I− ion in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite.
 Fig. 5  A series of PL images (of the same area taken at time indicated) are shown side by side to illustrate the extent of ion movement and accumulation resulting in the widening of a PL quenched region over time. The blue lines depict the cathode and the anode. The region between the +ve blue line and the yellow dotted line indicates the PL quenched region set up by ion migration and accumulation. 
To investigate the impact on carrier dynamics and clarify the mechanism of PL quenching induced by ion migration and accumulation, electrical bias dependent time-resolved PL was measured using a TCSPC technique on the lateral CH3NH3PbI3 sample. The measured PL decay traces can be nicely fitted by using the stretched exponential decay function of I = I0exp(−(t/τ)^β), where τ is the PL lifetime and β is the dispersion factor.44–46 The fitted values are displayed in Table S1 (ESI†). The 4 stages of biasing and the PL lifetimes as a function of time are shown in Fig. 6a while the PL traces measured at t = 120, 420, 720 and 1020 s are shown in Fig. 6b. No electrical bias is applied during stage 1 (t = 0 to 120 s) and stage 3 (t = 420 to 720 s), while a positive bias (0.5 V μm−1) or negative bias (−0.5 V μm−1) was applied during stage 2 (t = 120 to 420 s) or stage 4 (t = 750 to 1020 s), respectively. In the first stage (t = 0 to 120 s, in Fig. 6a), the PL lifetime before any biasing was ∼17 ns. This lifetime remained constant for 2 minutes under constant illumination and no sample degradation occurred. A positive 0.5 V μm−1 bias at stage 2 caused a drop in the PL lifetime which continuously (although slowly after t ∼ 170 s) dropped for 5 minutes to ∼10 ns just prior to removal of the bias. This slow behavior is consistent with ion migration. The timescale of seconds is consistent with the structure of the sample (the width of the perovskite layer between the FTO electrodes is ∼30 μm, while the thickness of the perovskite layer is hundreds of nm) and also with what has been observed in other work.7,24 Upon the removal of bias at stage 3 (t = 420 to 720 s in Fig. 6a), the PL lifetime recovered partially (∼13 ns) but not completely to the initial level (virgin lifetime of ∼17 ns) even after 5 minutes. In stage 4, with the application of opposite bias, the lifetime decreases again rather than further recovery. This can be interpreted as the accumulated ions which did not recover in stage 3 will not be restored to the original states under opposite bias. They however moved to the opposite electrode driven by the opposite bias. Moreover, during the opposite bias, more and more ions were activated again and accumulated with time. It again caused a reduction of the PL lifetime, which continuously (although slowly) dropped with time. The PL lifetime measured at stage 4, however, is approximately 11 ns, not as low as ∼10 ns measured at stage 2. This is because the pre-existing conditions established by the bias at stage 2 are still valid (which can take minutes or hours to recover, as demonstrated in Fig. 2), counteracting the effect of ion movement at stage 4. The effects of pre-existing conditions and scanning history caused by ion migration on hysteresis have also been reported by Tress et al.9 and Xiao et al.17 It has been recently reported that a forward bias can cause an overestimation of VOC, ISC and the measured current voltage curve,47,48 which can be explained by self-poling and built-in field screening effects17,24,30,35 induced by ion migration and accumulation. This means that care must be taken in selecting the pre-biasing conditions of the cell prior to current voltage measurements to avoid inaccuracy.

To further understand the effect of ion migration on localized carrier dynamics, TCSPC was measured on two areas of the sample, one closer to the anode (Area 1) and one closer to the cathode (Area 2) before and after biasing (0.5 V μm−1 for 10 minutes) as shown in Fig. 7a and b. The TCSPC was continuously measured during a 10 minute interval providing thousands of data points, which are plotted in Fig. 7d–g. Fig. 7c shows the typical PL decay curves of each area, before and after biasing. It is evident that the PL decay in Area 2 (closer to the cathode) did not experience much change after biasing. In the area where there is an accumulation of I− ions near the anode (Area 1), the PL decays faster. The average PL lifetimes of the Areas 1 and 2 are similar before biasing, which are ∼20 ns; see Fig. 7d and e. After biasing, the PL lifetimes near the anode deteriorated with a mixed distribution; see Fig. 7f. A new peak at ∼8 ns, most prominent for carriers in Area 1, is induced by the accumulation of I− ions. It suggests a fast carrier-depletion channel formed by the accumulation of mobile ions in the PL quenched region causing Auger-like non-radiative recombination which has been previously suggested49–51 as seen in the reductions of both the PL quantum yield and lifetime in the perovskite film22 (induced by mobile ions) and other semiconductor nanoparticles49–51 (induced by mobile charges). In contrast, the effect on carrier dynamics near the cathode is not evident (see Fig. 7b, c and g), suggesting that only the accumulation of negative ions (i.e., I− ions) induces the Auger-like non-radiative recombination while the effect of positive ions (or vacancies of negative ion) on carrier dynamics is negligible.

Negative feedback between perovskite decomposition and ion accumulation
While perovskite decomposition and ion migration can co-occur under an electric field, there exists a negative feedback between decomposition and ion migration. It is found that decomposition enhances ion migration while ion migration reduces decomposition; see Fig. 8a.
 Fig. 8  (a) Schematic of negative feedback between the perovskite decomposition and ion migration and accumulation; (b) a sketch of band diagrams at the different stages of ion migration and accumulation: (I) before biasing, (II) immediately after biasing and (III) after ion accumulation. 
The evidence of decomposition enhancing ion migration is shown by comparing the responses of the pre-moisturized sample and control sample in Fig. 3. It is evident that the pre-moisturized sample decomposes more rapidly than the control sample; see Fig. 3b and f. It is also evident that the PL quenching caused by ion migration is more rapid in the pre-moisturized sample compared with the control sample; see Fig. 3d. Therefore, the ion migration-induced PL quenching is enhanced when decomposition occurs. The decomposition in turn causes further production of ionic species (i.e. iodine ion),29,30 and therefore increases the ion concentration and accelerates their migration and accumulation. Videos S1 and S2 in the ESI† provide further evidence of decomposition-enhanced-PL quenching with time.
The suppression of decomposition by ion migration is evident from the absence of irreversible decomposition of perovskite in the middle of the structure. While PL quenching occurs, this is reversible as seen from the “After ∼1 day recovery” image in Fig. 2h. Further the PbI2 peak is absent in the PL spectrum for the perovskite in the middle of the structure as seen from Fig. 4d. This can be explained by the ion migration and accumulation at the anode which opposes the applied electric field in the middle. As illustrated in Fig. 8b, ions in the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite are uniformly distributed between the FTO electrodes before biasing. Once the bias is applied to the sample, the electric field will be evenly distributed across the perovskite. The I− ions will drift and move towards the anode. With the accumulation of I− ions and vacancies near the anode and cathode, respectively, a built-in field is set up, which partially offsets the applied electric field9,16 (see Fig. 8b(III)) screening the ion decomposition. This reduces the perovskite decomposition in the perovskite bulk, which is the reason why perovskite decomposition in our experiments only occurs near the electrodes, not in the middle of the structure, as shown in Fig. 2h and 4.
Conclusion
In this work, we monitor the electric field induced PL response in laterally structured CH3NH3PbI3 samples through PL optical microscopy. The PL responses reveal both irreversible and reversible processes. The irreversible response is caused by moisture-assisted electric-field-induced perovskite decomposition and only occurs if the strength of the applied field is larger than a threshold value which is dependent on the ambient moisture (the value is ∼0.8–0.9 V μm−1 in ambient air with RH ∼ 40%). The decomposition is most rapid at the electrode/perovskite interfaces, which is one of the main causes for perovskite solar cell instability under operation. Our experiments show the importance of encapsulation, which could improve the stability of perovskite under an electric field. The reversible PL quenching near the anode, which occurs under all electric fields, is attributed to ion migration and accumulation. The diffusion coefficient of the mobile ion is experimentally determined to be ∼2.1 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 at 0.5 V μm−1, which is close to the value reported previously for I− ions. By comparing the localized PL lifetimes, we suggest that the accumulated negative ions induce enhanced non-radiative recombination and therefore reduce both the PL intensity and lifetime. The increased recombination rate will have a detrimental effect on device performance.
Another important finding of this work is the role of ion accumulation at the electrode/perovskite interface in screening the decomposition of the perovskite in the bulk. This opens up opportunities for stabilizing perovskite solar cell operation under electric bias. Our findings will aid future device structures that utilize the screening effect to achieve stable long-term operation of perovskite solar cells.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of laterally structured sample with a CH3NH3PbI3 layer on the top (not to scale), (b) SEM image, (c) PL image and (d) PL spectrum of the CH3NH3PbI3 sample before electrical bias (inset shows the zoomed PL spectrum for wavelength range of 480–540 nm). The two blue lines indicate the region of the perovskite in the ∼20 μm wide gap between the FTO electrodes.	 

 	Fig. 2  PL images of the same sample biased as the electric field was progressively increased at (a) 0.2 V μm−1, (b) 0.3 V μm−1, (c) 0.4 V μm−1, (d) 0.5 V μm−1, (e) 0.6 V μm−1, (f) 0.7 V μm−1, (g) 0.8 V μm−1 and (h) 0.9 V μm−1. At each biasing, the electric field was held constant for 3 minutes. Between each biasing, the sample was allowed to recover for 15 minutes except for the 0.8 V μm−1 and 0.9 V μm−1 biasing, where the sample was allowed to recover for one day. The left image in each panel from (a) to (h) shows the PL image of the sample after a 3-minute bias while the right PL image is taken after 15 minutes of recovery (except for (g) and (h), in which each panel shows the results of one-day recovery).	 

 	Fig. 3  PL images of the pre-moisturized sample (a) before and (b) after 15 minutes of biasing at 0.5 V μm−1. (c) SEM image of the pre-moisturized sample after biasing. PL images of the control sample (non-moisturized) (e) before and (f) after 15 minutes of biasing at 0.5 V μm−1. (g) SEM image of the non-moisturized sample after biasing. (d) PL intensity vs. bias time and (h) PL spectra (on 480–540 nm band) after biasing, of the two samples (red for pre-moisturized and blue for the control sample).	 

 	Fig. 4  PL image of the pre-moisturized sample after 1 day recovery from 15 minutes biasing at 0.5 V μm−1 (a) and PL spectra measured at the quenching area near the cathode side (b), at the quenching area near the anode side (c), and at the recovered area between two electrodes (d). Insets in (b) and (d) show the zoomed PL spectra for wavelength range of 480–540 nm.	 

 	Fig. 5  A series of PL images (of the same area taken at time indicated) are shown side by side to illustrate the extent of ion movement and accumulation resulting in the widening of a PL quenched region over time. The blue lines depict the cathode and the anode. The region between the +ve blue line and the yellow dotted line indicates the PL quenched region set up by ion migration and accumulation.	 

 	Fig. 6  Bias dependent TCSPC measurements performed on a lateral sample. (a) Applied bias (above) and measured PL lifetime (below) as functions of time. (b) PL decay traces of the sample under each bias condition measured at t = 120; 420; 720 and 1020 s.	 

 	Fig. 7  Localized TCSPC measurements on a lateral sample before and after biasing (10 minutes under 0.5 V μm−1). Area 1 is near the anode while Area 2 is near the cathode: (a) before bias and (b) after bias. (c) PL decay curves measured from the areas before and after biasing. Distribution of PL lifetimes in (d) Area 1 and (e) Area 2 before biasing; and (f) Area 1 and (g) Area 2 after biasing.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) Schematic of negative feedback between the perovskite decomposition and ion migration and accumulation; (b) a sketch of band diagrams at the different stages of ion migration and accumulation: (I) before biasing, (II) immediately after biasing and (III) after ion accumulation.
