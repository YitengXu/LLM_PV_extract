    , Accepted 24th August 2021First published on 24th August 2021AbstractHydrogen and ammonia are ubiquitous chemical raw materials with a wide range of industrial applications. Methane steam reforming and Haber–Bosch process are the most commonly used industrial technologies for hydrogen production and ammonia synthesis. However, these processes are energy intensive with high CO2 emissions. In this review, promising technologies for hydrogen and ammonia production based on dense proton conducting membrane reactors are comprehensively introduced and relative developments and challenges are summarized, including membrane materials, operating temperatures, and hydrogen sources, along with their properties and performance. For each application, the future research goals to overcome relative challenges are analyzed, and the prospective developments to meet the industrial requirements are discussed.
1. Introduction
1.1 Production of hydrogen
Hydrogen is a very important chemical raw material that is used in a wide range of applications, including the synthesis of ammonia, and as fuel for hydrogen-powered vehicles.1,2 Therefore, hydrogen is not only an important industrial reactant but also an indispensable clean fuel for transportation. The important practical applications of hydrogen are shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  The practical applications of hydrogen in different fields. 
In particular, in the chemical fertilizer industry, the majority of hydrogen production originates from methane steam reforming,3 whose product then reacts with N2 to produce ammonia on the surface of Fe-based or Ru-based catalysts through the Haber–Bosch process: 1/2N2(g) + 3/2H2(g) ⇌ NH3(g) ΔrHθm (298.15 K) = −46.11 kJ mol−1(1)
In the past hundred years, the global food demand has increased rapidly, requiring the large-scale application of chemical fertilizers during production. Therefore, ammonia synthesis is of great importance, as NH3-based fertilizers are significant to the world's rapidly increasing population. In addition, hydrogen is an ideal fuel for transportation, as hydrogen reacts with oxygen to produce water without any pollutant. Airplanes, automobiles, and even rockets have been designed on the basic concept of deriving huge amounts of propulsive power by burning hydrogen fuel. Notably, as a fuel with a high calorific value,4 hydrogen is used widely in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for power generation. PEMFCs and SOFCs are considered as promising technologies for electrochemical devices that interconvert efficiently between electrical energy and chemical energy to achieve high energy conversion and storage efficiency. The relevant reactions in fuel cells are presented below in Table 1.

At present, various sources of hydrogen production are being explored in depth, such as natural gas, chemical waste gas, coal, biomass, and water. Industrially, hydrogen is produced through several routes, but the optimal route is determined by the costs and production scale. The most common methods involve catalytic reforming of hydrocarbons, such as methane steam reforming, which is used widely for large-scale hydrogen production.3 Other techniques for the production of hydrogen such as coal gasification, biomass pyrolysis/fermentation and photo/electrochemical water splitting are well explored and have been established as supplementary methods for hydrogen production.5
Hydrogen production via methane steam reforming is the most important industrial method. The process can mainly be described by the following reactions: CH4(g) + H2O(g) → CO(g) + 3H2(g) ΔrHθm(298.15 K) = +206 kJ mol−1(2) CO(g) + H2O(g) → CO2(g) + H2(g) ΔrHθm (298.15 K) = −41.2 kJ mol−1(3)
To realize better utilization of reactants, the above processes need to be operated between 800 °C and 1000 °C with high steam concentration.6 The other three main supplementary techniques for hydrogen production in the chemical industry are coal steam reforming, methanol steam reforming,7 and water electrolysis.8,9 The relevant chemical reactions describing these three techniques are presented below.
(1) Coal steam reforming: C(s) + H2O(g) → CO(g) + H2(g) ΔrHθm (298.15 K) = +131 kJ mol−1(4) CO(g) + H2O(g) → CO2(g) + H2(g) ΔrHθm (298.15 K) = +41.2 kJ mol−1(5)
(2) Methanol steam reforming: CH3OH(g) → CO(g) + 2H2(g) ΔrHθm (298.15 K) = +90.5 kJ mol−1(6) CO(g) + H2O(g) → CO2(g) + H2(g) ΔrHθm (298.15 K) = + 41.2 kJ mol−1(7) CH3OH(g) + H2O(g) → CO2(g) + 3H2(g) ΔrHθm (298.15 K) = +49.4 kJ mol−1(8)
(3) Water electrolysis: H2O(g) → 1/2O2(g) + H2(g) ΔrHθm (298.15 K) = +241.818 kJ mol−1(9)
As shown in eqn (4)–(8), these chemical processes not only produce the target product hydrogen but also release CO2, contributing to the global greenhouse effect. In contrast, hydrogen production from water electrolysis is an environmentally friendly and sustainable technology as shown in eqn (9), so it is certain to play a significant role in the future hydrogen economy. As this technique uses water as the hydrogen source, it is a clean process that releases zero pollution. Further, this process achieves the production of pure oxygen with low energy consumption and no CO2 emissions, different to methane steam reforming. Furthermore, hydrogen can be also produced via the decomposition of ammonia under mild conditions, which is another suitable alternative for hydrogen production in the future energy economy. Because of this superiority, ammonia is considered a novel fuel in energy conversion devices, such as liquid ammonia fuel cells.
1.2 Synthesis of ammonia
Ammonia is regarded as a very promising hydrogen carrier because its weight percentage of hydrogen (17.8 wt%) is higher than that of methanol, which contains only 12.5 wt% hydrogen. Hence, ammonia is an environmentally friendly fuel without CO2 emissions during use. In addition, ammonia is one of the most important raw materials for industrial chemical production, and almost 80% of ammonia is used in the chemical fertilizer industry. Given the current rapid global population growth, the development of NH3-based fertilizers must be greatly expanded to ensure food security.10 Moreover, ammonia is also widely used in pharmaceuticals, synthetic fibers and as a freezing medium.
Research about ammonia synthesis can be traced back to approximately 100 years ago. At that time, several ammonia synthesis methods were developed by many researchers; of particular note is the cyanamide method (the Frank–Caro process), which is described by eqn (10) and (11): (10) CaCN2 + 3H2O → 2NH3 + CaCO3(11)
However, there are many of drawbacks to these methods, including extremely high energy requirements and extremely low energy utilization efficiency under very harsh operating conditions. Therefore, the abovementioned ammonia synthesis methods are not practically applied in industry.
By 1913, the Haber–Bosch process had become an established industrial technology, using mainly Fe-based catalysts in the operating temperature and pressure ranges of 350–550 °C and 150–350 atm, respectively. This was the first confirmation that ammonia synthesis could be successfully achieved when using nitrogen and hydrogen gases as reactants with catalysts participating in the reaction system.
Owing to the chemical inertness arising from the strong NN triple bond with extremely high bond energy (up to 940.95 kJ mol−1), the Haber–Bosch process must be performed at high temperatures to speed up the reaction on the surface of the catalyst. Although the reaction kinetics of ammonia synthesis are accelerated at high temperatures, the generated ammonia is also subject to an accelerated rate of decomposition based on thermodynamic principles. According to Le Chatelier's principle, a higher operating pressure needs to be applied to the system to achieve an appropriate ammonia yield to meet the industrial demand. Nevertheless, given the significant energy requirements of the Haber–Bosch process owing to the high reaction temperatures and high operating pressure, as well as the large masses of hydrogen required, the process consumes approximately 2% of the world's total energy and is responsible for the emission of many tons of greenhouse gases, causing energy and environmental problems.11 Therefore, it is necessary to develop alternative approaches for ammonia synthesis to replace the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch process and thereby alleviate the increasingly serious environmental and energy-related problems. According to the recent research status, two promising alternatives are taken into consideration as follows: one is the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (e-NRR) using proton exchange membranes under mild conditions; the other is ammonia synthesis using electrochemical dense proton conducting ceramic membrane reactors (EPCMRs) at high temperatures. The detailed comparisons of these above three technologies for ammonia synthesis are presented in Table 2.

The synthesis of ammonia via an e-NRR under mild conditions in an aqueous system can be described as follows: nitrogen molecules are fixed on the cathodic catalyst surface and then reduced by electrons provided by an external circuit. Simultaneously, they react with protons to produce ammonia. This technique possesses several advantages compared with the Haber–Bosch process. Firstly, the electrochemical reduction of nitrogen molecules can be achieved under mild operating conditions (room temperature, ambient pressure) and using renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, rather than thermal energy, which can effectively alleviate energy and environmental problems. Secondly, this technique directly uses clean and sustainable water as the hydrogen source instead of hydrogen. Consequently, this technique has attracted great interest of numerous researchers. However, the e-NRR method also faces several challenges. Firstly, this technique shows a serious competitive reaction between the HER and NRR, which can be summarized as the following aspects:
(1) From the thermodynamic perspective, the reaction equations and the corresponding theoretical reaction potentials in the e-NRR are presented below:
Acidic system: 2H+ + 2e− = H2 Eθ = 0.000 V vs. RHE(12) N2 + 6H+ + 6e− = 2NH3 Eθ = +0.092 V vs. RHE(13)
Alkaline system: 2H2O + 2e− = H2 + 2OH− Eθ = −0.828 V vs. RHE(14) N2 + 6H2O + 6e− = 2NH3 + 6OH− Eθ = −0.736 V vs. RHE(15)As seen in the above equations, whether in an acidic or alkaline system, the theoretical reaction potentials of the HER and the NRR are very close. However, the NRR process is actually performed at a large overpotential owing to the high activation energy barrier of the strong NN triple bond with extremely high bond energy (up to 940.95 kJ mol−1), indicating that the vigorous HER will be an unavoidable competitive reaction under NRR operating conditions.12
(2) Based on the number of charge transfers, the NRR process: N2 + 6H+ + 6e− → 2NH3 is a multiple electron transfer reaction which implies the possible existence of multifarious intermediates when assuming one by one electron transfer.13 Clearly, it is a very complex electrochemical process, which has to require multiple proton-coupled electron transfers to complete the conversion of N2 to NH3.12,14 By comparison, the HER process: 2H+ + 2e− → H2 is only a 2-electron transfer reaction.15,16 This means that protons are more likely to acquire two electrons to form hydrogen gas during the charge transfer process. Therefore, the 2-electron transfer reaction HER is always more kinetically preferred than the complex multi-step 6-electron NRR process.
(3) N2 solubility in an aqueous solution system is extremely low (only reaches 6.8 × 10−4 ppm at 25 °C),17 which indicates that the NRR process is highly impacted by mass transport, leading to very slow kinetics. Moreover, it is revealed that the majority of catalytic materials are intrinsically favorable for the adsorption and activation of protons over chemically inert nitrogen molecules, finally resulting in the fact that most surface active sites of the catalytic materials are occupied by the undesired protons and then poor NRR selectivity is delivered.18
Based on the above reasons, there is indeed a serious competitive relationship between the NRR and HER processes. Under mild operating conditions, the HER process proceeds more easily than the NRR process, compromising the faradaic efficiency. Secondly, the activation and reduction process of nitrogen under mild conditions would be difficult and undoubtedly be the rate-determining step of ammonia synthesis. As previously reported, the nitrogen molecules are fundamentally hard to activate on the surface of an inhomogeneous catalyst at temperatures below 100 °C.19,20 Hence, the e-NRR process is frequently limited by the reaction kinetics of the low operating temperature. Many researchers have proposed strategies to improve the activity and selectivity of currently available catalysts for the e-NRR under mild conditions, including the development of nitrogen fixation catalysts and selection of the targeted electrolyte.20,21 However, the above strategies cannot fundamentally resolve these challenges. Therefore, it is necessary to develop other alternatives to the e-NRR under mild conditions.
In 1981, Iwahara et al. found that some SrCeO3-based oxides had good proton conductivity in hydrogen-containing atmospheres at high temperatures (500–1000 °C). Consequently, widespread attention is given to proton-conducting oxide materials, which are favored for ammonia production by EPCMRs. These oxide electrolyte materials mainly include perovskite, fluorite, or pyrochlore structures, which usually operate over 500 °C. Molten salt electrolytes and solid acid electrolytes can also be used in EPCMRs, which commonly operate at 300–500 °C and below 300 °C, respectively. This EPCMRs can couple ammonia synthesis with other hydrogen-involved chemical reactions at a favorable temperature, such as water electrolysis and methane steam reforming. In addition, owing to the higher conductivity and faster reaction kinetics at higher operating temperatures, a higher current density and greater ammonia yield are expected to be achieved in EPCMRs.
2. Proton conducting membranes for hydrogen production
2.1 Advantages of membrane technology
Hydrogen production through fossil fuel reforming and gasification, such as methane steam reforming, usually employs gas mixtures and requires further purification. Currently, there are three main feasible methods for pure hydrogen production: pressure swing adsorption (PSA),22–24 cryogenic distillation, and membrane separation.25 The current industrially available technologies include PSA and cryogenic distillation methods. In the available PSA or cryogenic distillation technologies, higher energy consumption and higher cost are needed in the H2 separation process, while membrane separation technologies can make this process more cost-effective and sustainable, which are regarded as promising alternatives.26–28 Noble RD et al.29 made a detailed statement that H2 production using efficient membranes can operate continuously, consuming less than half the energy required for the PSA or cryogenic distillation process. Moreover, membrane separation technology for H2 production is more spatially flexible to offer H2 purification at different scales. Currently, Pd-based membranes are highly selective to hydrogen and can achieve high hydrogen permeation fluxes at 300–600 °C.30–34 However, these Pd-based membranes with high cost easily suffer from H2 embrittlement as well as H2S and CO poisoning under the operating conditions, which seriously limit their practical applications in the H2 separation industry.35 Recently, dense proton conducting membranes have been well studied for hydrogen production owing to several significant advantages: (1) high hydrogen selectivity, which can theoretically reach 100% as they can separate and purify hydrogen in the form of protons rather than molecules; (2) excellent chemical and thermal stability under the operating conditions; (3) easy extraction of H2in situ from the hydrogen sources at high temperatures; (4) integration of in situ hydrogen production with some important chemical reactions, such as steam cracking; (5) low economic costs and high energy efficiency. Therefore, dense proton conducting membranes are regarded as the most promising technology for hydrogen production in practical application.
2.2 Mechanisms of proton conducting membranes
Based on the conductivity of the materials, proton conducting membranes can be divided into two types: one is a mixed proton–electron conducting material, which possesses protonic and electronic conductivity simultaneously and the other is a pure protonic conductor. At present, numerous relevant studies are focused on dense mixed proton–electron conducting membranes, which will be discussed in detail below. And these strategies are also applicable to pure proton conducting membranes for hydrogen production.
As shown in Fig. 2, hydrogen production using proton conducting membranes is a multi-step process, the main steps of which are surface exchange on the feed side, bulk diffusion in the membrane, and surface exchange on the sweep side, successively:
 Fig. 2  Schematic diagram of hydrogen production using proton conducting membranes. (a) Mixed proton–electron conducting membranes; (b) pure proton conducting membranes. 

Surface exchange process on the feed side. 
(1) External diffusion: H2 diffuses from the main gas phase to the surface of the proton conducting membrane.
(2) Physical adsorption: hydrogen molecules diffused to the surface of the proton conducting membrane are adsorbed on the membrane surface.
(3) Chemical dissociation: hydrogen molecules adsorbed on the membrane surface dissociate into protons and then combine with the lattice oxygen.


Bulk phase diffusion process. 
(4) According to the route of electron transportation, there are some differences between mixed proton–electron conducting and proton conducting membranes. As shown in Fig. 2(a), driven by the concentration gradient of the gas phase, the protons jump between the oxygen atoms in the bulk phase of the membrane and migrate directionally to the other side. Simultaneously, to maintain the electrical neutrality of the material, the electrons migrate in the same direction. In contrast, the electrons migrate through the external circuit under the influence of electricity in proton conducting membranes as shown in Fig. 2(b).


Surface exchange process on the sweep side. 
(5) Surface exchange: on the low hydrogen partial pressure side, protons and electrons recombine on the membrane surface to form chemically adsorbed hydrogen.
(6) Surface desorption: the chemically adsorbed hydrogen on the surface of the membrane combines with hydrogen molecules and desorbs from the surface.
(7) Outer diffusion: the hydrogen molecules desorbed from the surface of the membrane diffuse to the gas phase on the low hydrogen partial pressure side.
Steps (1) and (7) are the diffusion processes of hydrogen in the gas phase, which are mainly related to the hydrogen concentration gradient of the gas phase and the membrane surface; steps (2), (3), (5), and (6) belong to the kinetic processes of hydrogen exchange on the membrane surface; and step (4) is the process of proton diffusion in the membrane bulk. The hydrogen permeation rate of the proton conducting membrane can be determined by either the surface exchange process or the bulk diffusion process; although, in most cases, it is controlled by both processes. When the hydrogen permeation process of the proton conducting membrane is controlled by the surface exchange process, reducing the resistance to surface exchange can significantly increase the hydrogen permeation rate. Current effective methods to reduce the surface exchange resistance include the modification of the surface of the mixed proton–electron conducting membrane by coating with Pt,36,37 Pd,38 or other catalysts on the surface, or acid etching on the membrane surface. For example, Chen et al.39 studied the effects of a Pt layer on the hydrogen permeation flux of the La5.5W0.45Nb0.15Mo0.4O11.25−δ (LWNM) membrane. At 1000 °C, when the feed side was operated under conditions of humidified 50% H2:50% He, the Pt-coated LWNM membrane could reach a hydrogen permeation flux of 0.483 mL min−1 cm−2, which was twice that of the uncoated membrane. Moreover, four types of modified membranes with different coating modes were evaluated as illustrated in Fig. 3. The study found that the surface exchange reaction rate of the sweep side coated with a Pt layer was more effective than that of the feed side coated with an equivalent Pt layer, indicating that the surface exchange reaction rate on the sweep side played a decisive role in the total surface exchange reaction.

For relatively thick membranes, the bulk diffusion process is the rate-determining step for a proton conducting membrane; therefore, the hydrogen permeation can be quantified using the Wagner equation:40,41 (16)where JH2 is the hydrogen permeability, R is the ideal gas constant, F is the Faraday constant, L is the membrane thickness, σi is the electrical conductivity, and the subscripts OH*, e′, h* and t represent protons, electrons, electron holes, and total conductivity, respectively.  and  represent the hydrogen partial pressure on the feed side and the sweep side, respectively. According to the Wagner equation, the hydrogen permeability is inversely proportional to the membrane thickness L, so reducing the thickness can greatly reduce the bulk diffusion resistance, thereby increasing the hydrogen permeability.
In conclusion, many factors affect the hydrogen permeation process of dense proton conducting membranes, including the type of membrane material, the membrane thickness, and the microscale morphology of the membrane, as well as the operating conditions such as temperature, gas flux, and concentration.

2.3 Development of proton conducting membrane materials

2.3.1 Perovskite-type. 
Perovskite-type metal oxides are the most commonly studied proton conducting materials. Their formula is ABO3,42 and the valence ratios of the metal ions at the A and B positions are generally A2+B4+O3, A1+B5+O3, or A3+B3+O3. To maintain the cubic perovskite crystal structure, the A-site metal ion and B-site metal ion must satisfy a certain relationship, which is generally represented by the tolerance factor,43 given by: (17)where rA, rB, and rO are the metal ion radius at position A, the metal ion radius at position B, and the O2+ ion radius, respectively. Only when 0.75 < t < 1 can the material form a perovskite structure.
Most of the perovskite-type proton conducting membrane materials are based on BaCeO3−δ and SrCeO3−δ systems. Many researchers have studied a series of BaCeO3−δ-based materials that exhibit high proton and electron conductivity at high temperatures (usually >800 °C).44 The total conductivity of SrCeO3−δ-based materials is lower than that of BaCeO3−δ-based materials, but they have a higher proton conductivity at higher temperatures. In 1981, Iwahara et al.45 provided the first report that the perovskite-type oxide SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3−δ exhibited good mechanical strength and high proton conductivity. Over the subsequent decades, many researchers have studied perovskite-type proton conducting membrane materials doped with Y, Sm, Yb, Mn, Nd, Tb, Eu, Tm, In, Gd, and other variable metal ions at the B site to introduce more holes and thereby to improve the electronic conductivity of BaCeO3−δ-based and SrCeO3−δ-based materials, which can effectively improve the practical hydrogen permeation flux.
The recent developments of perovskite-type proton conducting materials are shown in Fig. 4. To date, many researchers have reported various in-depth studies of perovskite-type proton conducting membrane materials. Wei et al.46 reported that the hydrogen permeability of SrCe0.95Tb0.05O3−δ reached 1.6 × 10−2 mL min−1 cm−2 at 900 °C. Subsequently, they also reported a dense BaCe0.85Tb0.05Zr0.1O3−δ membrane with a layer thickness of 50 μm and an asymmetric structure, which had a hydrogen permeation flux of 0.07 mL min−1 cm−2 at 800 °C.47 As shown in Fig. 5, the hydrogen permeation flux was a function of temperature for different membrane thicknesses, indicating that for hydrogen transport, it was advantageous to decrease the thickness of the dense layer of the asymmetric membrane. Although different metal ions are doped at the B site in single-phase membrane materials, they usually have low electron conductivity, leading to low hydrogen permeability, which has limited their development in practical applications. Hence, dual-phase membranes with high proton conductivity and high electron conductivity were developed. In two-phase membranes, one phase is responsible for proton transport and the other is responsible for electron conduction.

In 2016, Cheng et al.48 reported a novel membrane synthesis method, which was used for preparing a dual-phase membrane BaCe0.85Fe0.15O3−δ (BCF8515)–BaCe0.15Fe0.85O3−δ (BCF1585) by a one-pot method. A schematic illustration of this method is shown in Fig. 6. The authors found that the high Ce content phase BCF8515 had high proton conductivity, whereas the high Fe content phase BCF1585 had high electron conductivity. As expected, the hydrogen permeation flux of this 1.0 mm thick dual-phase membrane could reach a high value of 0.76 mL min−1 cm−2 at 950 °C.

Although the hydrogen permeation performance of perovskite-type proton conducting membranes has been improved through the aforementioned methods, the alkaline earth metals Ba2+ and Sr2+ contained in the perovskite facilitate the reaction with acidic gases, such as CO2, to form carbonates, which damage the structure of the membrane and affect the hydrogen permeability and operation lifetime of the membrane.49–53 As previously reported, to improve the stability of SrCeO3-based and BaCeO3-based membrane materials in an acidic atmosphere such as CO2, many researchers performed important studies of doping metal ions at the B site, such as Zr4+, Ta5+, and La3+. However, these metal ion strategies cannot completely solve the problem of poor stability in an acidic environment. Therefore, it is crucial to develop novel alkaline earth metal-free membrane materials with high permeability and excellent stability even under harsh operating conditions.


2.3.2 Lanthanum tungstate-type. 
In recent years, lanthanum tungstate-type proton conducting membrane materials have attracted widespread attention.37,54–58 As they are free of alkaline earth metals, these lanthanum tungstate-type oxide materials have good chemical stability in CO2, H2O, and H2S atmospheres, making them promising materials for proton conducting membranes. The development of lanthanum tungstate-type proton conducting membrane materials is shown in Fig. 7.

Although lanthanum tungstate-type proton conducting membrane materials have good operational stability, their hydrogen permeation fluxes are very low. To increase their hydrogen permeation flux, many researchers have used ion-doping strategies to improve the proton and electron conductivity. Chen et al.59 reported a membrane material without alkaline earth metals and discussed the effect of the La/W ratio on the membrane structure, stability, and hydrogen permeation characteristics. As shown in Fig. 8, at a La/W ratio of 5.5, the stability and hydrogen permeability achieved a good balance, and the hydrogen permeation flux of the La5.5WO11.25−δ membrane improved concomitantly with an increase in operational temperature but remained at a low level. To increase the hydrogen permeation flux, a metal–ceramic dual-phase hydrogen permeable membrane can be constructed by introducing the metal Ni, which has high electronic conductivity. Xie et al.57 prepared Ni–LWO metal–ceramic dual-phase hydrogen permeable membranes and the hydrogen permeation fluxes of the LWO membranes can be improved greatly by introducing an electron conducting phase. In Ni–LWO dual-phase membranes with different volume ratios of Ni/LWO, when the feed gas contained 50% H2, the maximum hydrogen permeation flux of a membrane containing 60 vol% Ni was 0.18 mL min−1 cm−2 at 1000 °C.

In addition to introducing the electron conducting phase, the optimization of the membrane structure is another effective strategy to improve the membrane permeability by preparing an asymmetric membrane or hollow fiber membrane to reduce the bulk thickness of the membrane. The asymmetric membrane structure consists of a thinner dense layer (reducing bulk diffusion resistance) and a porous substrate (facilitating surface exchange) and is regarded as an effective way to improve the hydrogen separation performance. As shown in Fig. 9, Chen et al.60 successfully prepared a La5.5W0.6Mo0.4O11.25−δF0.05 (LWMF05) asymmetric membrane with improved hydrogen permeability and enhanced stability compared with the symmetric membrane, achieving a maximum value of 0.16 mL min−1 cm−2 at 975 °C. Further, the long-term hydrogen permeability of the asymmetric LWMF05 film was better than that of the symmetric LWMF05 membrane. Xie et al.61 prepared a La5.5W0.6Mo0.4O11.25−δ (LWM) ceramic membrane with an asymmetric structure by inverse sintering. They found that the hydrogen permeation flux of the asymmetric membrane was twice as high as that of the traditional symmetric dense LWM membrane. Moreover, the hollow fiber membrane usually has remarkable characteristics of large specific surface area and small thickness, and has recently attracted the attention of researchers. Chen et al.55 successfully prepared a high-density U-shaped LWM hollow fiber membrane by wet-spinning phase inversion and sintering. They found that when using 80% H2–20% He as the feed gas at 975 °C, the hydrogen permeation flux could reach 1.36 mL min−1 cm−2 in a humidified environment. In addition, the in situ XRD patterns indicated that the LWM powder had good phase stability in CO2 when heated and cooled in a pure CO2 atmosphere at 1000 °C. Liu et al.62 also studied the hydrogen permeability of U-shaped Nd5.5W0.5Mo0.5O11.25−δ hollow fiber membranes. At 975 °C, the hydrogen permeation flux reached 1.29 mL min−1 cm−2. Many studies have shown that U-shaped hollow fiber membranes have great potential for pure hydrogen production and other high value-added chemical products as catalytic membrane reactors. As shown in Fig. 10, Xue et al.56 firstly reported a nonoxidative methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) process in a novel U-shaped La5.5W0.6Mo0.4O11.25−δ hollow fiber membrane reactor with excellent anti-CO2 chemical stability. In comparison with the fixed-bed reactor, this membrane reactor could not only produce aromatics, but could also in situ remove H2 to overcome thermodynamic constraints.

Notably, anion doping represents a novel strategy to weaken the bonding force between the metal and oxygen, thereby accelerating the migration rate of protons and improving the hydrogen permeability of the lanthanum tungstate material. As shown in Fig. 11, Chen et al.60 first reported that fluoride anion doping can be used to improve the hydrogen separation performance of proton conducting membranes. The authors synthesized a series of La5.5W0.6Mo0.4O11.25−δFx (x = 0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.50) membrane materials and studied the hydrogen separation performance of fluoride anion-doped La5.5W0.6Mo0.4O11.25−δFx membranes at different temperatures and fluorine concentrations. For x = 0.05, the hydrogen permeation flux reached a maximum value of 0.20 mL min−1 cm−2 at 1000 °C. Later, Chen et al.58 also developed chlorine anion-doped La5.5W0.6Mo0.4O11.25−δ−x/2Clx membranes. They found that the LWMCl0.1 membrane had higher hydrogen permeability and better stability, reaching 0.15 mL min−1 cm−2 in a dry atmosphere (50% H2/He) at 1000 °C. Accordingly, the strategy of anion doping, usually fluorine and chlorine, at the site of the lattice oxygen atoms could effectively improve the hydrogen permeability of lanthanum tungstate materials, and the optimization of different anions doped onto lanthanum tungstate materials and other improvement strategies will be developed in future. As discussed above, a summary of different types of proton conducting membrane materials and hydrogen permeation fluxes is presented in Table 3.

2.4 Categories and advantages of hydrogen production in EPCMRs
Recently, electrochemical proton conducting membrane reactors mainly driven by electricity have been well studied for their potential applications in the production of high value-added chemical products, such as pure hydrogen, ammonia, ethylene, and benzene. Based on the direction of hydrogen transportation and the type of electrolyte material, we divide the EPCMRs into several categories as follows.
Firstly, according to the direction of hydrogen transportation, the EPCMRs can be classified into two categories, which are defined as extractor and distributor based on their functions, respectively, as shown in Fig. 12.
 Fig. 12  Different functions of electrochemical proton-conducting membrane reactors. (a) As an extractor in water electrolysis; (b) as a distributor in ammonia synthesis. 
In an extractor membrane reactor, protons can be extracted from water splitting,83–86 methane dehydroaromatization (MDA),56,87 or ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene from alkane cracking.88,89 In this type of EPCMR, the chemical reaction performance can be improved when the hydrogen product is continuously and selectively removed from one side to the other side of the membrane reactor. Given the inherent and major advantages, compared with a fixed bed, the chemical reaction in the membrane reactor could break the limitations of thermodynamic equilibrium and high conversion of the reactant and high yield of the target product can be achieved.
In the other distributor membrane reactor, protons can be provided by water electrolysis and methane steam reforming,90 which can produce hydrogen to react with other reactants in hydrogen-involving reactions, such as ammonia synthesis91 and carbon dioxide reduction.92–94 Through a proton-conducting membrane distributor reactor, the protons are very active and can easily react with other reactants to produce the target products, which can reduce the energy barrier of the reaction process, speed up the reaction rate and improve the yield of products.
Secondly, according to the type of electrolyte material, the previous electrochemical membrane reactors usually employed proton exchange membrane electrolyzers (PEMEs) at low temperatures (<100 °C),95 dense proton conducting ceramic electrolyzers (PCEs) at intermediate temperatures (400–600 °C) and solid state oxide electrolyzers (SOEs) at high temperatures (>800 °C)96,97 for hydrogen production. In both PEMEs and SOEs, undiluted dry oxygen is produced at the anode while the hydrogen diluted with steam can be formed on the cathode of the electrolyzers. However, the disadvantages of the low current density and the relatively low faradaic efficiency through PEMEs, the short operational life of the electrolyzers, the expensive construction materials, and the constraints on process integration of SOEs limit their applications. Unlike the abovementioned water electrolysis technologies, pure and dry hydrogen can be continuously produced on the cathode of the EPCMRs at 400–600 °C, which can achieve in situ electrochemical compression of produced hydrogen (without dehumidification) inside the electrolyzers.83–86 The electrolysis process can effectively reduce system complexity and economic cost with no external condenser for practical applications. Moreover, these reduced intermediate operating temperatures (400–600 °C) enable a wide range of energy sources (e.g., industrial waste heat sources), which lower the economic cost of this process and improve the reliability, thermal cycling tolerance, and dynamic response. Schematic diagrams of the above water electrolysis technologies are presented in Fig. 13.
 Fig. 13  Schematics of water electrolysis technologies: (a) proton exchange membrane electrolysis cell at low temperature (PEME); (b) proton conducting electrolysis cell at intermediate temperature (PCE); (c) solid state oxide electrolysis cell at high temperature (SOE). 
During the process of water electrolysis in EPCMRs at an intermediate temperature, H2O loses electrons at the anode side, and protons are transmitted through the membrane at the cathode side to form pure dry H2. In contrast to water electrolysis at low temperatures,95 a much higher current density can be applied at 400–600 °C to achieve a higher hydrogen yield, which is expected to meet industrial requirements. Moreover, water electrolysis at favorable intermediate temperatures can couple some significant chemical reactions, such as ammonia synthesis or CO2 reduction, via chemical hydrogenation processes in EPCMRs. In addition to water electrolysis, hydrogen production from methane steam reforming can also be achieved in EPCMRs, which is regarded as an important chemical reaction process. In 2016, Stoukides et al.90 reported the feasibility of methane steam reforming at low temperatures (450–650 °C) in a Ni–BaZr0.7Ce0.2Y0.1O3−δ (BZCY72)/BZCY72/Cu EPCMR, as shown in Fig. 14, which could simultaneously achieve hydrogen separation. They also found that when hydrogen was transported in situ from the Ni–BZCY72 anode to the cathode under electric power, an obvious enhancement in methane conversion and hydrogen production yield was achieved. The Ni–BZCY72/BZCY72/Cu electrochemical proton-conducting membrane reactor had good chemical stability and durability as well as coke tolerance under the operating conditions. The relevant chemical reactions of methane steam reforming in EPCMRs are as follows: Anode side: CH4 + 2H2O → CO2 + 8H+ + 8e−(18) Cathode side: 8H+ + 8e− → 4H2(19) Overall reaction: CH4 + 2H2O → CO2 + 4H2(20)

Although hydrogen production from fossil fuels has unique advantages in terms of cost and large-scale production, the overuse of fossil fuels and the associated carbon emissions cause serious environmental problems. Therefore, when compared with the above method for hydrogen production using EPCMRs, the direct production of hydrogen from water electrolysis is more attractive. The water electrolysis in EPCMRs comprises two main electrochemical reaction processes: Anode side: H2O → 1/2O2 + 2H+ + 2e− (Oxygen evolution reaction, OER)(21) Cathode side: 2H+ + 2e− → H2 (Hydrogen evolution reaction, HER)(22)
Clearly, the use of water electrolysis for hydrogen production is of great significance to humans because it is an environmentally friendly and highly efficient process; moreover, this process exhibits zero carbon emissions when using clean and pollution-free water. Further, it can be coupled with renewable energy, especially solar and wind power. With the large-scale developments and utilization of renewable energy and the continuous expansion of water electrolysis technology, this hydrogen production technique will inevitably become increasingly competitive.
Notably, water electrolysis technology can achieve a high current density and a considerable faradaic efficiency at high temperatures (400–600 °C) in EPCMRs, enabling the large-scale production of hydrogen. It is noteworthy that Duan et al.85 provided a detailed description of a successful advanced laboratory-scale EPCMR. Based on their research, the laboratory-scale hydrogen production cost using EPCMRs was approximate $1 per kg (based on a wholesale electricity price of 3–4 cents per kW h), suggesting that the system-level hydrogen production costs may be able to reach the U.S. Department of Energy target of $2 per kg.98,99 Therefore, water electrolysis using EPMCRs has huge economic advantages that will support the future development of commercial applications.
2.5 Reaction steps of water electrolysis in EPCMRs
This reaction is divided into cathodic reaction steps and anodic reaction steps, respectively. At the cathodic electrode, a Ni/protonic ceramic cermet is often the main material, which has good performance for the HER. Two active protons coming from the anodic side can very easily combine to form a hydrogen molecule at the surface of the cathodic electrode. By utilizing a high-performance electrocatalyst on the anodic side, the water-electrolysis reaction rate can be increased, which can reduce the system overpotential resulting in the additional benefit of improving the energy conversion efficiency. Recently, most studies have focused on the development of novel materials for the anodic side that can greatly enhance the OER.83–86 As shown in Fig. 15, the possible reaction steps for the OER at the anodic electrode are as follows:
 Fig. 15  Schematic illustration of electrochemical processes of the OER in the anodic electrode. 
(1) The adsorption of molecular water on the electrode surface: H2O(g) → H2O*;(23)
(2) The dissociation of molecular water into surface species: H2O* → H* + OH*;(24)
(3) Charge transfer at the electrode surface: (25) (26)
(4) Transportation of protons through the electrode bulk to the electrolyte: (27)
(5) Oxygen desorption at the electrode surface: 2O* → O2;(28)
(6) Transportation of surface species to the triple phase boundary (TPB): H* → HTPB, OH* → OHTPB;(29)
(7) Charge transfer at the TPB: (30) (31)
(8) Transportation of protons to the electrolyte: (32)
(9) Oxygen desorption at the TPB: 2OTPB → O2;(33)where  is the lattice oxygen,  is the protonated lattice oxygen, h˙ is the electron hole, and  is the oxygen vacancy. These nine reaction steps of the OER process explain how the electrolysis water is formed on the triple phase boundary (TPB) of the cathodic electrode. Among these reaction steps, the dissociation of molecular water into surface species in step (2) is the rate-determining reaction step of the whole OER process, whereas the remaining reaction steps have a secondary effect on this process. Hence, for water electrolysis, the development of novel and highly efficient catalysts for the OER, which exhibit low apparent polarization resistance, high electronic conductivity, and excellent stability in high-steam atmospheres, is a priority.
As described by the following reactions, one gaseous water molecule incorporates into the oxygen vacancy by the hydration reaction to form : (34) (35)
The reactions above show that there is a competition between oxidation and hydration for the oxygen vacancies. The OER process produces more electron holes with an increase in PO2, which may contribute to the lower faradaic efficiency. A reduction of the oxidation reaction and the simultaneous increase in the hydration reaction can facilitate the process of water electrolysis, which can achieve high faradaic efficiency under electronically driven conditions.85,100–102 As shown by the thermodynamic equation, the equilibrium constant of the hydration reaction (35), khydrogen, can be written as follows: (36)where ΔSθhydration and ΔHθhydration are the standard hydration entropy and enthalpy, respectively. The hydration equilibrium constant khydrogen and resulting proton concentration  can be written as: (37) (38)
Similarly, according to reaction (1), the oxidation equilibrium constant kO and resulting hole concentration [h˙] can be expressed as: (39) (40)
As shown by eqn (38) and (40), the hydration reaction increases with PH2O, and the oxidation reaction increases with PO2. Therefore, the hole concentration [h˙] can be written based on PH2O and PO2: (41)
As mentioned above, to promote the hydration reaction and suppress the oxidation reaction to prevent reaction (34), which produces many more electron holes, the steam concentration should be increased and the oxygen concentration should be decreased, which will favor water electrolysis.
2.6 Research status of hydrogen production in EPCMRs

2.6.1 The current challenges. 
H2 production from water electrolysis at high temperatures faces a multifaceted challenge: it is difficult to assemble a highly effective cell device, which requires putting a porous anode electrode (water steam decomposition), a dense protonic ceramic electrolyte, and a porous cathode electrode (protons combine to form hydrogen) together into an electrochemical proton-conducting membrane reactor. During water electrolysis, adverse electron leakage from the membrane electrolyte affects the faradaic efficiency. Most proton conducting membranes for EPCMRs were originally intended to be predominantly proton conductors with extremely low electronic conductivity, but other mobile charge-carrying defects were identified during operation. A theoretical 100% faradaic efficiency indicates that one proton is conducted through the proton-conducting membrane with one electron supplied by an external circuit. A lower faradaic efficiency indicates that some other defects, instead of the desired protons, are responsible for the charge transport through the membrane, which is usually called “electronic leakage”.100
Some notable scientific studies have suggested that the defect chemistry, transport properties, and electrochemical performance of different material compositions have a profound impact on the electronic charge carrier transference number.100,101 As shown in Fig. 16, Zhu et al. compared the electronic charge carrier transference number of BaZr0.8Y0.2O3−δ (BZY20) and BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3−δ (BCZYYb7111) electrolyte materials, and confirmed that the latter one exhibited lower electron leakage and higher faradaic efficiency under different operating conditions.85,100,101 It should be noted that the faradaic efficiency decreases continuously with the increase in oxygen content, confirming the serious electron leakage occurring in oxidizing environments. Subsequently, Duan et al.85 employed a highly effective and reversible catalyst, the all-perovskite BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3−δ (BCFZY) cathodic electrode, which has excellent performance and stability for the OER in high-steam and high-oxygen environments at high temperatures. The electron leakage in BZY20 was much more severe than that in BCZYYb7111 under the same operating conditions, resulting in lower faradaic efficiency and a lower energy conversion efficiency (ECE).
 Fig. 16  The comparison between (a) BZY20 and (b) BCZYYb7111 electrolyte materials in terms of electronic charge carrier transference number under the same operating conditions is as follows: predicted cell potentials, power density, electrolyte potential difference, and faradaic efficiency as functions of current density at 600 °C and atmospheric pressure. The gas-phase composition on the fuel side is fixed at 97.0% H2 and 3.0% H2O. Four gas-phase compositions on the air side are 1.0%, 10.0%, 50.0%, and 80.0% O2 balanced with H2O. Reproduced with permission from ref. 100. Copyright 2018 the Electrochemical Society. 
Further, the authors also found that the faradaic efficiency and ECE improved concomitantly with an increase in steam concentration, and the highest faradaic efficiency was achieved at intermediate current densities. In nearly open circuit or low current density conditions, the electrolyte changed to function as a mixed proton-electron conducting membrane, leading to the reversal of H2 transport through the membrane that partially or even completely eliminated the produced H2, which is explained in detail as shown in Fig. 17. Similarly, at a high current density, the faradaic efficiency and ECE in BCZYYb7111-based cells (the thickness of the BCZYYb7111 membrane electrolyte was approximately 15–20 μm) began to decline as more H2O was consumed to produce O2, which spontaneously produced electron holes through the incorporation of molecular oxygen into oxygen vacancies through the accompanying oxidation reaction. Therefore, under these operating conditions, the faradaic efficiency and the electricity-to-hydrogen ECE cannot reach high values owing to different degrees of electronic leakage.
 Fig. 17  Schematic illustration of why faradaic efficiency drops sharply when the current density is close to zero. 
The properties and thickness of the membrane electrolyte mostly determine the resistance and the faradaic efficiency of the membrane reactor. In an EPCMR with a thin membrane electrolyte, thermodynamic equilibrium-driven electronic leakage will lead to low faradaic efficiency. In contrast, Einar Vøllestad et al.86 reported a 30 μm membrane electrolyte (comparatively thicker than the aforementioned 15–20 μm) in an EPCMR for water electrolysis, which was prepared by spray-coating. The schemes of the tubular EPCMR and predicted faradaic efficiencies using eqn (8) as a function of charge transfer resistance and total system pressure are shown in Fig. 18. This thicker membrane electrolyte had much higher resistance than the 15–20 μm membrane. The authors found that EPCMRs with a thicker membrane electrolyte also resulted in lower faradaic efficiency because of the overpotential-driven electron leakage at a high current density, and the faradaic efficiency gradually decreased with an increase in the current density. The authors also developed a novel catalyst, Ba1−xGd0.8La0.2+xCo2O6−δ, for water splitting, which had good mixed p-type electron and proton conductivity and low activation energy.

2.6.2 The strategies to improve water electrolysis performance. 
As shown by eqn (37), (40), and (41), there is a great need to increase the proton concentration, decrease the electron–hole concentrations, and suppress electron leakage, thereby improving the faradaic efficiency. Hence, for practical operations, it is critical to modulate the operating conditions, including high steam concentrations, to facilitate the hydration reaction and the electronic charge carrier concentrations to hinder electronic leakage. Moreover, it is necessary to develop novel and efficient anodic electrodes with excellent hydrothermal stability, which will reduce decomposition and the formation of miscellaneous phases; this can not only enhance the membrane reactor durability and improve the oxygen evolution reaction rate under harsh operating conditions, but also reduce the overpotential and consequently minimize electron leakage to maximize the faradaic efficiency and enhance the ECE.

3. EPCMRs for ammonia synthesis
3.1 Advantages of ammonia synthesis using EPCMRs
Recently, the ever-increasing demand for ammonia has inspired extensive research into artificial NH3 production technologies.103,104 The electrochemical synthesis of ammonia under mild operating conditions has several complications, predominantly low catalytic activity and ultralow selectivity.21,105–108 Accordingly, one of the most important targets in this field is to enhance the faradaic efficiency at a reasonable current density to meet the requirements for commercial applications. Since the first study 30 years ago, there have been many studies of EPCMRs for ammonia synthesis, as they can operate at favorable temperatures and at ambient pressure. In this technique, the proton-involving chemical reactions and nitrogen reduction reactions were integrated into this novel reactor at an appropriate temperature. For example, it is worth noting that using green, pollution-free water as a hydrogen source has garnered much attention. EPCMRs can achieve in situ electrolysis of water to extract highly activated protons that directly attack nitrogen molecules on the surface of the cathodic catalyst to produce ammonia gas under an electronic driving force.20,91,109–112 Furthermore, using water electrolysis to produce hydrogen avoids large amounts of carbon dioxide emissions and produces oxygen, an important industrial gas, as a side reaction. The specific reaction steps are presented below: Anode side: H2 → 2H+ + 2e−(42) Or H2O → 1/2O2 + 2H+ + 2e−(43) Or CH4 + 2H2O → 8H+ + CO2 + 8e−(44) Cathode side: N2 + 6H+ + 6e− → 2NH3(45)
These fields of research are thoroughly summarized in Tables 4 and 5, based on electrolyte materials, operating temperature, and hydrogen sources. In EPCMRs, the operating temperature and electrode reactions of a membrane reactor are mainly dependent on the type of membrane electrolyte material. Over the past few decades, various types of membrane electrolytes operating in a wide range of temperatures have been studied in electrochemical cells for ammonia synthesis. According to the membrane electrolyte materials, ammonia synthesis using EPCMRs can be classified into three main parts: low temperature (T < 300 °C), intermediate temperature (300 °C < T < 500 °C), and high temperature (500 °C < T).

3.2 Ammonia synthesis at high temperatures (T > 500 °C)
In 1998, Stoukides et al.113 reported the first experimental achievement of electrochemical ammonia synthesis using a strontia–ceria–ytterbia perovskite of the form SrCe0.95Yb0.05O3 (SCY) as an electrolyte in high-temperature solid oxide electrolyzers at ambient pressure. A schematic of the electrochemical membrane reactor is shown in Fig. 19. In this cell (H2, Pd|SCY|Pd, N2&He), the solid state electrolyte SCY has high proton conductivity as well as good chemical and mechanical stability.114 Both anodic and cathodic electrodes were deposited on the porous polycrystalline palladium films. Ammonia production was performed at 570 °C and atmospheric pressure, with an H2 feed as the anodic gas and a mixture of N2 and He as the cathodic gas. Nearly 78% of the electrochemically supplied hydrogen contributed to the ammonia synthesis. The anodic hydrogen molecules dissociated into protons and the formed protons transported through the SCY dense electrolyte to directly attack N2 molecules with electrons on the surface of the cathode to produce ammonia under an external circuit current, although no ammonia production was observed. At 2 mA cm−2, the ammonia formation rate was essentially independent of the N2 partial pressure, as it was limited by the electrochemically supplied hydrogen. Nevertheless, a higher current density could not be achieved and the H+ flux was limited to within a narrow range owing to the high ohmic resistance of the SCY electrolyte. Moreover, the experiments revealed that approximately 20% of the produced ammonia decomposed into N2 and H2 at the operating temperature, which indicated that the ammonia synthesis was thermodynamically limited at the operating temperature of 570 °C.

Later, the same group developed a proton conducting double-chamber cell Cu/BCZY27/Ni–BCZY27, as shown in Fig. 20.115 A maximum electrochemical ammonia production rate of 4.1 × 10−9 mol s−1 cm−2 and a faradaic efficiency of 6.51% could be achieved with the operating conditions of PH2/PN2 = 1 at 620 °C. Interestingly, in this cell, the authors observed an enhanced reaction rate even though the cell was in a zero-current state for a period of time. A feasible explanation for this favorable phenomenon is that a proportion of the protons electrochemically moved to the cathode is “stored” in the Ni–BZCY72 electrode, forming a type of active proton that directly attacks the adsorbed N species on the surface of the catalyst to produce ammonia, even under current-interrupted conditions.

In 2019, Vasileios Kyriakou et al.91 were the first to demonstrate an electrochemical Haber–Bosch (EHB) process that integrated steam-methane reforming and water gas shift for hydrogen production with ammonia synthesis in a tubular BaZrO3-based proton-conducting membrane reactor at 550–650 °C. A schematic of the electrochemical Haber–Bosch process is shown in Fig. 21, where the proton formation and the NRR occurred on the anodic Ni-composite electrode and the cathodic porous VN–Fe composite catalyst, respectively. The highest ammonia synthesis rate and the faradaic efficiency reached 1.89 × 10−9 mol s−1 cm−2 and 14%, respectively. Moreover, the authors made an objective and theoretical comparison of energy analysis and CO2 emissions of the electrochemical ammonia synthesis technology compared with the traditional Haber–Bosch process. Though the best results obtained in this work were still not comparable with the traditional Haber–Bosch process, this novel and feasible electrochemical ammonia synthesis technique is noteworthy. However, the reactor structure and nitrogen fixation catalyst require optimization for further progression.

Owing to the high resistance of electrolytes at the operating temperature, the reactor cannot achieve a high current density, which means that high-volume ammonia production cannot be obtained by this technique. Therefore, it is necessary to develop thinner electrolytes for application in these reactors. Some research efforts have been devoted to optimizing the reactor structure proposed by Ma's group.116 A dense BaCe0.85Y0.15O3−δ (BCY15) electrolyte, with a thickness of 30 μm, supported on a porous NiO–BaCe0.85Y0.15O3−δ anode, was prepared by spin-coating as presented in Fig. 22. Under the optimal operating conditions, the ammonia synthesis rates reached a maximum of 4.1 × 10−9 mol s−1 cm−2 using the perovskite oxide catalyst Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ as the cathode. At high operating temperatures, very fast reaction kinetics were achievable, but this was unfavorable to the reaction thermodynamics for ammonia synthesis. Therefore, further reduction in the operating temperature is critical for achieving higher electrochemical ammonia synthesis rates and faradaic efficiencies in EPCMRs.

3.3 Ammonia synthesis at intermediate temperatures (300 °C < T < 500 °C)
Ammonia synthesis at high operating temperatures (>500 °C) using EPCMRs is not thermodynamically favorable because ammonia will decompose at an accelerated rate. Accordingly, further reduction of the operating temperature is an effective strategy for ammonia synthesis. Tao's research group has made some contributions to the developments of ammonia synthesis processes at 300–500 °C using a series of doped-ceria–carbonate composite electrolytes and perovskite oxide cathode materials in a simple single chamber reactor, as shown in Fig. 23.117–121

As previously reported, the carbonates—(Li, Na, K)2CO3—in the composite electrolyte are ternary molten salts with a eutectic point of 396 °C.122,123 The (Li, Na, K)2CO3 salts confer high ionic conductivity to the composite electrolyte at relatively low temperatures to further lower the operating temperature of the membrane reactor; these composite electrolyte materials can conduct several types of ions, such as Li+, Na+, K+, H+, HCO3−, CO32−, and O2−, and the ionic conductivity reached a maximum of 0.1 S cm−1 at approximately 400 °C. Therefore, some researchers have taken advantage of their good H+/O2− ionic conductivity to synthesize ammonia at 300–500 °C.20,110,111 Amar et al.119 investigated the use of a cobalt-free La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Cu0.2O3−δ–Ce0.8Sm0.2O2−δ (LSFCu-SDC) composite cathode and an SDC-ternary carbonate composite electrolyte for electrochemical ammonia synthesis at 400–475 °C. As shown in Fig. 24, the best ammonia production rate was found to be 5.39 × 10−9 mol s−1 cm−2 at 450 °C and 0.8 V, although the authors did not provide data on the current density under the operating conditions; hence, the faradaic efficiency was unknown. Subsequently, Lan et al.120 reported the synthesis of ammonia directly from wet air at intermediate temperatures in a simple single chamber reactor using Ce0.8Gd0.2O2(CGO)–(Li, Na, K)2CO3 electrolyte and a novel perovskite oxide Pr0.6Ba0.4Fe0.8Cu0.2O3 cathode. It is well established that barium is a good catalytic promoter for ammonia synthesis and that multi-valent praseodymium can improve the electronic conductivity of cathode materials. Hence, Pr0.6Ba0.4Fe0.8Cu0.2O3 is considered as a promising nitrogen reduction electrocatalyst. The concept of ammonia synthesis from air/N2 and water at intermediate temperatures has been successfully demonstrated in this work. They found that the current density decreased with increased applied potential, which was considered as the “blocking effect” of ions observed previously.124 Under a high applied potential, cations such as Li+, Na+, and K+ move directly to the cathode, whereas anions such as HCO3− and CO32− tend to move directly to the anode, which results in the formation of a positively charged layer on the electrolyte side of the cathode/electrolyte interface. This interface will prevent the movement of H+/O2− ions to the other side as a result of the lower current density when a high potential is applied. Under the operating conditions of 400 °C and 1.4 V, the ammonia production rate and the faradaic efficiency reached maximum values of 1.83 × 10−6 mol s−1 m−2 and approximately 5%, respectively. Moreover, it was found that wet nitrogen as a mixed feed gas resulted in higher ammonia production rates and faradaic efficiencies than wet air under the same operating conditions, which may be related to the lower partial pressure of N2 in wet air than in wet N2.

The presence of O2 in wet air may have a negative influence on ammonia production. Oxygen molecules will compete with nitrogen molecules for protons and may preferentially react with protons to form water. O2(air) + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O(46)
The produced ammonia molecules may react with O2 to cause oxidation reactions. The following competitive reaction may occur at high operating temperatures: 3O2(air) + 4NH3 → 2N2 + 6H2O(47)
When wet air is used as the feed gas, because the composite electrolyte can conduct O2− ions, O2 in wet air must be pumped from the anode side to the cathode side under electric conditions, wasting current with no contribution to the formation of ammonia and hydrogen. Therefore, when feeding wet air into the reactor, owing to the presence of O2, the current used for migration of O2− will be notably higher, resulting in a higher current density but lower faradaic efficiency.
The direct production of ammonia from air and water at intermediate temperatures is a very attractive research area in electrochemical ammonia synthesis. In contrast to using of dry pure H2 and N2 as the reactants, electrochemical ammonia synthesis can be achieved by utilizing directly steam and air instead of H2 and N2 as the raw materials, respectively, bypassing the hydrogen production and nitrogen separation stages used industrially. This is regarded as a promising technology for ammonia production. However, the use of a doped-ceria–carbonate composite as electrolyte for ammonia synthesis in this single chamber reactor likely faces two main problems: low faradaic efficiency and the possible decomposition and oxidation of the produced ammonia. At a high current density, a great proportion of electrons is used for the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen, which represents a possible safety hazard. Moreover, the produced ammonia can also react with oxygen (from the air) at the operating temperature. Therefore, when using clean water as a hydrogen source, a two-chamber reactor is more suitable for water electrolysis, and it is more attractive to develop a novel electrolyte material that can be operated in a favorable temperature range (<300 °C) for ammonia synthesis.
3.4 Ammonia synthesis at low temperatures (T < 300 °C)
Many groups have recently studied novel proton conducting electrolytes, such as solid acid electrolytes, including CsHPO4 and CsH2PO4, that can be used at low temperatures (<300 °C) for ammonia synthesis. These novel proton conducting materials have high proton conductivity and good chemical stability under the appropriate conditions, which have been extensively documented. However, these materials contain a second phase CsH5(PO4)2, which leads to higher proton conductivity but poor stability. To avoid the phase transitions and further improve the proton conductivity of these solid acid electrolyte materials, some composite materials, usually mixed with oxides such as SiO2 and SiP2O7, are under investigation.125–127
Solid acid materials, such as the composite material CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 for the membrane electrolyte, are used widely for ammonia synthesis, especially at low operating temperatures (100–300 °C). Qing et al.128,129 reported a series of composite materials, including CsH5(PO4)2/SiO2, CsH5(PO4)2/quartz fiber, and CsH2PO4/SiP2O7, as membrane electrolytes, and five types of electrode materials, including Pt/C-, Pt–Ru/C-, Ru/C-, Ru-, and Ag–Pd-loaded carbon paper, that were tested as cathode catalysts for ammonia synthesis. The authors made a detailed comparison of the performance of ammonia synthesis using dry pure hydrogen and steam as the hydrogen sources, respectively. The graphical information and the ammonia synthesis performance compared with the literature values are shown in Fig. 25. When dry pure H2 was employed as the hydrogen source and Pt/C- or Ru-loaded carbon paper was used as the cathodic catalyst, ammonia production rates were above 10−10 mol s−1 cm−2. In comparison, when steam was used as the hydrogen source and Pt–Ru/C- or Ru/C- or Ru-loaded carbon paper was used as the cathode, ammonia production rates were above 10−11 mol s−1 cm−2. Regrettably, extremely low ammonia production rates and faradaic efficiencies were found in these two reactors, for the following reason: at high current densities, the cathodic catalyst active sites were most likely occupied by a high proportion of protons, hindering the adsorption and dissociation of nitrogen molecules, leading to a clear reduction in the ammonia formation rate and the faradaic efficiency. They also found that the composite materials may be not stable, and electrolyte dehydration and decomposition may occur. Furthermore, the reaction system permits the reaction between the formed ammonia and the electrolyte at the operating temperature, so that new compounds could be formed in either dry or aqueous solutions.130

In Jun Kubota's group, Imamura et al. reported a promising proton conducting composite CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 material as an electrolyte for ammonia synthesis at 250 °C,20,110,111 where an electrochemical cell consisting of a Ru/Cs+/MgO catalyst, a Pd–Ag membrane cathode, a CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 electrolyte, and a Pt anode was proposed.20 A schematic illustration of an electrochemical membrane reactor for ammonia synthesis from nitrogen and water is shown in Fig. 26. The basic scientific concept is that the protons produced from water electrolysis on the Pt anode side permeate through the electrolyte and Pd–Ag membrane, then directly react with N2 on the surface of the Ru/Cs+/MgO catalyst to form ammonia. The maximum ammonia formation rate and the faradaic efficiency reached 7.7 × 10−10 mol s−1 cm−2 and 3.5% at 6.4 mA cm−2 and 1.2 V under an N2 flow of 1 mL min−1, respectively. The faradaic efficiency for ammonia synthesis is so low because of the serious hydrogen evolution reaction. Therefore, two main drawbacks exist in this electrolysis cell:

(1) The protons from the water electrolysis of the Pt anode side that permeate through the Pd–Ag membrane surface can readily combine to form hydrogen molecules. Obviously, this noble metal is a very good catalyst for the HER as one proton prefers to combine with the other proton to form a hydrogen molecule than to combine with N2 to form ammonia.
(2) The Ru/Cs+/MgO cathode catalyst for the NRR is disfavored in this system. The catalyst carrier MgO has poor conductivity and is not capable of conducting protons, which results in the hydrogen molecules bonding with nitrogen on the surface of the catalyst, rather than protons. Moreover, the low Ru-based catalyst content, nearly 2 wt% Ru/Cs+/MgO, and the poor electrical conductivity of MgO bring a further decrease of nitrogen fixation reaction efficiency.
Subsequently, Imamura et al. performed several similar studies in this type of electrochemical membrane reactor, examining the effects of some experimental conditions, including Ru-based catalyst content, catalyst carriers, and operating temperature and pressure, on the ammonia synthesis rate and the faradaic efficiency.110,111 According to Le Chatelier's principle, increasing the operating pressure will support the ammonia synthesis reaction forward, as shown in Table 6; with an increase in operating pressure, both the ammonia synthesis rate and the faradaic efficiency showed the expected major improvements, and a maximum ammonia synthesis rate and a faradaic efficiency of 12.4 × 10−9 mol s−1 cm−2 and 12% at 250 °C and 0.7 MPa, respectively, using 5 wt% Ru/Cs+/MgO (Cs/Ru = 1 mol) for a current density of 30 mA cm−2, respectively, were observed. The Arrhenius plots of the rate of NH3 formation for the electrochemical synthesis at a current density of 3.2 mA cm−2 and ambient pressure using different nitrogen fixation catalysts are shown in Fig. 27. At temperatures of 200–250 °C, higher temperature and current density favor ammonia synthesis, but the higher current density also causes a serious HER (as shown in Table 7). Notably, as shown in Fig. 28, this composite electrolyte CsH2PO4/SiP2O7 is only stable for a short period time at a low current density, which indicates that a high current density and a long operating time will damage the composite electrolyte.

In conclusion, in this electrochemical membrane reactor system, the integration of exothermic catalytic ammonia synthesis with endothermic water electrolysis into an advanced electrolysis cell enabled a highly efficient setup with no appreciable heat loss. Therefore, the further development of novel and highly effective ammonia synthesis catalysts is crucial in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, along with the design of new, advanced electrolyte materials that will support efficient intermediate-temperature electrochemical nitrogen reduction reactions.110
3.5 Techno-economic analysis
Currently, the industrial Haber–Bosch process is required to be conducted under harsh conditions, particularly in a high-tension apparatus, which forced ammonia manufacturers to energy-intensive and centralized plants to achieve better economic feasibility.18,131 Besides, the hydrogen source required for the industrial production of ammonia is derived from the methane steam reforming (SMR) process, accompanied by a large amount of CO2 emissions, which is considered as the largest CO2 emission source during hydrogen production. Accordingly, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is needed to mitigate environmental concerns, but the carbon capture technology, including pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxy-combustion, also comes with several challenges of transporting and then storing CO2.132 Statistically, the current-day global average CO2 emissions from industrial ammonia production are about 2.9 tones per tonne NH3 and the corresponding trading price of carbon is approximately USD 27.5 per tonne CO2.133,134 That is, the present carbon prices would reach nearly USD 80 per tonne NH3 to current ammonia prices if implemented globally at this level. Recognizing that, the implementation of the CO2 sequestration process will inevitably account for a certain percentage of the total cost in ammonia production.
It is worth noting that ammonia production using clean water as the hydrogen source with renewable electricity throughout, such as solar or wind energy as the electricity source, will drive us closer to achieve a carbon-neutral process as well as further reduce production costs.112,135 Moreover, this attractive and promising ammonia production technology by EPCMRs is simpler and has fewer operation steps than the industrial H–B process, indicating that it probably takes good advantage of electricity from remote areas to bring the electrolysis-based ammonia production closer to realization. The available renewable sources of these areas could be employed as power for ammonia production by some small-scale plants, which could substantially decrease the distribution costs.91,136 According to the economic assessment of the International Energy Agency, the current investment for electrolysis-based production, estimated at USD 905 per tonne NH3, is much more economically competitive than that of SMR-based production with CCS, estimated at USD 1315 per tonne NH3.137,138
Besides, this ammonia production device using an EPCMR contains a dense proton conducting membrane that can theoretically reach 100% proton selectivity as it can separate and purify hydrogen in the form of protons rather than H2 molecules. Due to this unique advantage, the additional cost of separation and purification of hydrogen is completely eliminated. Furthermore, dry pure hydrogen could be continuously produced and then combine with N2 on the surface of the NRR catalyst, while those produced from the SMR process usually contain trace amounts of carbon monoxide, oxygen, water vapor and sulfur compounds, which probably cause poisoning of the NRR catalyst.139–141 From the perspective of the service life of the NRR catalyst, this electrolysis-based ammonia production technology is more competitive and desirable. In addition, the ultra-high current density (>1 A cm−2) and distributed facility of hydrogen production could be achievable in this EPCMR technology that is more favored by practical industry,18,85,142 indicating that a large amount of sustainable hydrogen will be produced and then provide a clean proton source for ammonia production. Following this, the industrial-grade ammonia yield will come closer to realization when the ammonia synthesis process couples with water electrolysis in a favorable temperature range. Overall, this electrochemical ammonia production technology is more likely to be a promising and competitive alternative to the SMR-based H–B process.
4. Conclusions and outlook
This review provides a comprehensive summary of the use of dense proton conducting membranes for hydrogen production and the use of EPCMRs to produce high-purity hydrogen by water electrolysis and ammonia under various conditions. The relevant literature sources are presented in the corresponding tables indicated above.
4.1 Proton conducting membranes for hydrogen production
In the current H2 production methods, although numerous works on dense perovskite-type and lanthanum tungstate-type proton–electron conducting membranes have been performed in recent years, in terms of commercialization, several challenges remain:
(1) Membrane materials: the current research into proton conducting membrane materials has focused mainly on perovskite-type oxides. Although perovskite-type oxides have high proton conductivity, the presence of alkaline earth metal ions leads to very poor stability in acidic gas environments at high temperature, such as CO2 and H2S. In contrast, lanthanum tungstate-type oxide materials have good chemical stability in CO2, H2O, and H2S atmospheres, which makes them the most promising proton conducting membrane materials for practical application. Currently, lanthanum tungstate-type proton conducting membranes with good chemical stability are still in the early stage of research, their hydrogen permeation fluxes are low and remain insufficient to meet the requirements of industrialization.
(2) Hydrogen permeation fluxes: proton and electron conductivities are the two important properties characterizing the dense ceramic proton–electron conducting membrane for hydrogen production. In the previous work, some membrane materials have high proton conductivity but low electron conductivity, while some membrane materials exhibit the opposite, leading to an insufficient hydrogen permeation flux. In order to obtain simultaneously high proton and electron conductivities, popular methods including the variable metal element doping strategy and construction of a dual phase membrane are usually conducted. However, it is still a non-negligible challenge to optimize the phase composition ratio and distribution of the phases inside the dense membrane.
(3) High-temperature sealing: the dense proton conducting ceramic membranes are usually operated at high temperatures (600–1000 °C), so it is very necessary to develop a novel high-temperature sealant in this research field. However, most sealants are always facing huge challenges and cannot stand for long-time operation under these harsh operating conditions, limiting the practical application of dense proton conducting membranes in industry. Moreover, most laboratory-scale membranes (>1 cm2) indeed face the challenge of gas leakage which makes the success rate of the experiment low during the performance test.
(4) Large-scale membrane system: the previous reports on H2 production are limited to laboratory-scale membranes. Obviously, the effective area of this membrane in laboratories is usually relatively small, so it is very important to design various kinds of tubular proton conducting membranes or hollow fiber membranes with a larger effective area to meet commercial requirements. From the view point of the engineering aspect, when operating in an actual environment, it is difficult to integrate a large number of tubular membranes into a favorable reactor without any obstacles.
Overall, to further improve the hydrogen permeability and stability of the membrane, numerous researchers have achieved effective measures to improve the membrane performance, such as construction of dual-phase membranes, optimization of the membrane structure, and anion and cation doping strategies. Therefore, proton conducting membranes with high stability, high hydrogen permeability, and good durability are still the future research directions. Concurrently, advanced high-temperature sealing technology and industrial-scale membrane systems for H2 production need to be further developed.
In EPCMRs, due to the electronic leakage, high faradaic efficiency of water electrolysis is hard to achieve. Therefore, to promote the commercialization of hydrogen production from water electrolysis technology using EPCMRs, future studies should address the following points: (1) the development of a novel and highly efficient catalyst for the OER is a priority. The catalyst should exhibit low apparent polarization resistance, high electronic conductivity, and excellent stability in high-steam atmospheres; (2) optimization of the operating conditions of water electrolysis is also important. Under high steam concentrations and low oxygen partial pressure, it is beneficial to improve the hydration reaction and simultaneously reduce the oxidation reaction, which can facilitate the process of water electrolysis.
4.2 EPCMRs for ammonia synthesis
Depending on the electrolyte materials, the synthesis of ammonia using EPCMRs can be classified according to the operating temperature: (1) >500 °C; (2) 300–500 °C; and (3) <300 °C. Compared with the Haber–Bosch method, the use of EPCMR technology for ammonia synthesis offers advantages related to energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The ammonia synthesis rate at high temperatures is largely limited by the thermodynamics of the process.
Accordingly, it is imperative to develop a novel electrolyte material for EPMCRs that can operate at the preferred temperatures of 100–300 °C. In addition, the synthesis of ammonia directly from air and water at favorable temperatures is very popular in studies of electrochemical ammonia synthesis. Compared with the direct use of dry pure H2 and N2 as the reactants, the use of air and steam as the raw materials is very attractive, as it bypasses the hydrogen production and nitrogen separation stages, which is a more economical, energy-saving, and environmentally friendly technology. The catalyst is the main determinant of the EPCMR performance, so the large-scale production of highly efficient, low-cost catalysts is required. Highly efficient nanomaterials and single-atom catalysts reported in this field have huge potential, with great prospects for improving the yield of ammonia production and the faradaic efficiency. Therefore, the development of a highly efficient catalyst for the nitrogen fixation reaction and a novel membrane electrolyte for ammonia synthesis at favorable temperatures are key goals for future research.
