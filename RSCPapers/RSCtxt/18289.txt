    , Accepted 8th December 2022First published on 9th December 2022AbstractSolar-powered photocatalytic H2O2 production is promising for its advantages of being safe, portable, green and energy efficient but achieving high efficiency is challenging, especially under pure water and air conditions. Herein, a titanium dioxide/polyethylenimine/Ag nanoparticle (abbreviated as TiO2/PEI/AgNP) photocatalyst is prepared in a facile manner by electrostatic assembly and in situ polymer reduction, which combines local surface plasmon resonance and photocatalysis to exhibit ultra-fast H2O2 production activity in pure water. The obtained photocatalysts exhibit an unexpectedly high H2O2 production activity (1605 μmol g−1 h−1 under simulated sunlight) in air and pure water, which is 24-fold higher than that of pristine rutile TiO2. The TiO2/PEI/AgNP composites simultaneously optimize three parts of photocatalytic H2O2 production: (i) improved charge separation, (ii) captured H+ faster and (iii) blocked direct contact of H2O2 and the catalyst. Experimental data and density functional theory calculations prove that the AgNP component can rapidly conduct high-energy electrons generated by themselves and photogenerated electrons generated by TiO2 to reactants. The PEI component can capture H+ from pure water faster to promote the superoxide radical to generate H2O2 through the proton coupling reaction and block direct contact of H2O2 and the TiO2 component. This work establishes a paradigm for the rational design of efficient plasmonic photocatalysts via self-assembly and in situ reduction technologies toward H2O2 production in pure water and air.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a high-value and versatile oxidant with diverse applications in industry and the environment.1–3 Due to the high energy density, H2O2 also serves as a future liquid energy carrier which is easily transportable and has no storage issues.4,5 The annual demand for H2O2 in the world is generally more than 6 million tons.6 Currently, H2O2 production still mostly uses the energy- and waste-intensive anthraquinone indirect oxidation process.7–10 This method not only requires expensive catalysts and bulk organic solvents, but also generates toxic byproducts. Compared with the traditional anthraquinone method, photocatalytic production of H2O2 offers a greener, ecofriendly and low-cost strategy for solar-to-H2O2 conversion, which uses oxygen gas and water as precursors and sunlight as the energy source.11–16 Thus, fabricating efficient photocatalysts is pivotal in boosting H2O2 production.
In recent years, numerous semiconductor photocatalysts have been applied in photocatalytic H2O2 production,17–23 such as titanium dioxide, organic polymers, graphitic carbon nitrides, and metal–organic frameworks. Among them, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most widely used for its advantages of earth abundance, non-toxicity and high stability. However, common anatase or rutile TiO2 are both limited by their wide bandgap and rapid charge recombination.24–26 Furthermore, in the process of solar H2O2 production, the degradation rate of H2O2 on the bare TiO2 surface is often higher than the generation rate, and a sacrificial agent often needs to be added.27–29 Thus, the development of efficient suppression of rapid charge recombination, the prevention of in situ H2O2 degradation over the TiO2 surface and the non-use of sacrificial agents can be three key strategies to build efficient, green and sustainable photocatalytic H2O2 production photocatalysts.
Plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis,30–35 which utilizes the local electromagnetic field enhancement of metal nanostructures to transfer high-energy electrons and promote the separation of photogenerated carriers in the bulk phase, further enhances the performance of semiconductor materials in the catalytic process, and is considered as a potentially effective approach to enhance photocatalytic performance and thus address the challenges mentioned above. The local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect is the effect of collective oscillation of valence electrons on the metal nanostructure surface, which is under the action of a certain external field (such as light).36 By adjusting the size, composition, morphology and other factors of these metal nanostructures, a controllable adjustment of the light absorption range can be achieved, which is expected to expand the spectral response range of the photocatalysts. The surface of metal nanostructures can generate local strong electromagnetic fields and high-energy photogenerated carriers under illumination to participate in surface catalytic reactions. Combining metal nanostructures with semiconductor photocatalytic materials can theoretically effectively promote the separation of photogenerated carriers and improve the photocatalytic activity.
Herein, we design and develop a novel plasmonic photocatalyst where polyethylenimine (PEI) and the generated AgNPs were assembled successively around the surface of rutile TiO2 fibers via electrostatic assembly and in situ polymer reduction, respectively. The TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers show ultra-fast photocatalytic H2O2 production activity without any sacrificial agents because of the combination of the LSPR effect, photogenerated carriers and PEI modification. Within 21 min, the obtained TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers can achieve high H2O2 generation for 561.5 μM (1605 μmol g−1 h−1) under sunlight in pure water and air, which is 24 times more efficient than that for pristine rutile TiO2. The rapid conduction of the high-energy electrons generated by AgNPs and photogenerated electrons generated by TiO2 towards reactants is conducive to improve charge separation. The H+ from pure water is captured by PEI faster to facilitate the superoxide radical to generate H2O2 through the proton coupling reaction. The PEI component can reduce the contact between the generated H2O2 and the TiO2 surface. Moreover, photogenerated holes can combine with OH− from pure water to form hydroxyl radicals, which further inhibit the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes (h+). We believe that this study gives new insights into the simple construction of plasmon-enhanced photocatalysts, but also inspires more studies to solve three key issues in efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals
Titanium butoxide was purchased from Adamas-beta®. Polyethylenimine (PEI, 700 KDa) was purchased from Aladdin. Ethylene glycol, H2SO4, H2O2 (30%), NaOH, HCl and AgNO3 were purchased from Xilong Chemical Co., Ltd, Guangzhou. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, k30), potassium hydrogen phthalate and potassium iodide were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, Beijing, China.
2.2 Synthesis of rutile type TiO2
The rutile type TiO2 fibers were synthesized by the ethylene glycol method. Briefly, the solution of titanium butoxide (1.634 g dissolved in 66 mL ethylene glycol) was added to the solution of PVP (1.0 g dissolved in 50 mL ethylene glycol) and the mixture was stirred for a while. Then, the mixture was heated to 195 °C and kept for 2 h. The resultant was centrifuged at 8000 rpm and washed with ethanol 5 times. The mixed powders were dried at 100 °C for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixed powders were calcined at 600 °C for 6 h under an ambient condition. To make the surface of TiO2 more hydrophilic, the mixed powders were immersed in piranha solution (the volume ratio of H2SO4 and H2O2 was 7:3) for 24 h and then dried at 100 °C for 4 h.
2.3 Preparation of TiO2/PEI/AgNPs and TiO2/Ag
The dispersion of TiO2 (1 mg mL−1, 50 mL) was added to excess PEI solution (5 mg mL−1, 50 mL) with stirring for a while, and the mixture was then allowed to stand for 20 min. The resultant TiO2/PEI was centrifuged (8000 rpm, 10 min) and washed with deionized water 3 times. The TiO2/PEI was then dried at 80 °C for 6 h. The TiO2/PEI/AgNP complex was prepared via in situ reduction of Ag+. Typically, 10 mM of AgNO3 solution was added dropwise to 1 mg mL−1 of the TiO2/PEI dispersion and incubated in the dark for 24 h. The final product was centrifuged (washed with deionized water), and then dried at 80 °C for 6 h.
The TiO2/Ag sample was prepared by simply mixing AgNO3 solution (10 mM) and a dispersion of TiO2 (1 mg mL−1) overnight at a volume ratio of 1:1. The resultant TiO2/Ag was centrifuged with deionized water 3 times and dried at 80 °C for 6 h.
2.4 Photogeneration of H2O2 and photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline
For photocatalytic H2O2 production, 50 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 50 mL pure water and ultrasonicated for 60 s. And then the photocatalyst dispersion was transferred into a double jacketed beaker. The photogeneration H2O2 tests were performed by using a 300 W Xe lamp as the light source at room temperature in air. The double jacketed beaker was continuously fed with condensed water to ensure that the temperature is maintained at room temperature during the photoreaction test. Every 3 min, 2 mL of dispersion was taken from the beaker and the photocatalyst residues were removed by centrifugation. 1 mL of the supernatant was preserved for further use. The concentration of H2O2 was determined by using an iodometry method. Briefly, 1 mL of potassium hydrogen phthalate solution (1 M) and 1 mL of potassium iodide solution (0.4 M) were added to 1 mL of the supernatant mentioned above, respectively. After 4 min, the adsorption of the mixture solution was measured by using the UV1800PC UV-vis spectra at 350 nm. The standard curve of H2O2 with different concentrations was built by using the adsorption differences at 350 nm. Photocatalytic H2O2 generation under different factors (such as different pH value) were measured in the same manner mentioned above.
For photocatalytic tetracycline (TC) degradation, 6 mg of photocatalyst was homogeneously dispersed in 30 mL of TC solution (2 mg L−1) and stirred in the dark for 0.5 h. Then, the mixture was irradiated with a Xe lamp to start the photocatalytic reaction. During the process of TC degradation, 2 mL of mixture dispersion was filtered and measured by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer at 355 nm. In order to determine the contribution of ˙OH and ˙O2− in the degradation of TC, tert-butanol (TBA, 1 mL) and p-benzoquinone (BQ, 1 mg) were used as quenchers of reactive oxygen species in photocatalytic experiments.
2.5 DFT calculations

Computational method. 
All the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)37,38 within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)39 formulation. The projected augmented wave (PAW) potentials40 were applied to describe the ionic cores. Valence electrons were considered using a plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 450 eV. Partial occupancies of the Kohn–Sham orbitals were allowed to use the Gaussian smearing method and a width of 0.05 eV. The electronic energy was considered to be self-consistent when the energy change was lower than 10−5 eV. A geometry optimization was considered convergent when the force change was lower than 0.03 eV Å−1. Grimme's DFT-D3 methodology41 was applied to describe the dispersion interactions. The DFT + U correction for strong-correlation 3d electrons of transition metals was taken into account, and the U–J value of 4 and 2 for Ti and Ag was used, respectively.


Modeling description. 
The equilibrium lattice constants of a TiO2 unit cell were optimized, when using a 11 × 11 × 17 Gamma k-point grid for Brillouin zone sampling, to be a = b = 4.63527 Å and c = 2.96920 Å. These lattice constants were used to build the p (2 × 2) gamma-TiO2 (101) surface slab with 2 atomic layers. This slab was separated by a 15 Å vacuum layer in the z direction between the slab and its periodic images. A model of pure TiO2 was built with 36 Ti atoms and 72 O atoms. A model of TiO2/PEI/AgNP was built with 36 Ti atoms, 72 O atoms, 4 N atoms, 6 C atoms, 18 H atoms and 13 Ag atoms. During structural optimizations of the surface models, a 2 × 2 × 1 gamma-point centered k-point grid for the Brillouin zone was used and the top 1 atomic layers were allowed to fully relax while the bottom atomic 1 layers were fixed.
The adsorption energy (Eads) of an adsorbate A was defined as:Eads = EA/surf − Esurf − EAwhere EA/surf, Esurf and EA are the energy of A adsorbed on the surface, the energy of the clean surface, and the energy of A in the gas phase, respectively.

2.6 Characterization
The morphology and element distribution of the samples were analyzed by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6510LV) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, H-8100, Hitachi). The assembled process was identified by using the zeta potential (Nano-ZS90, Malvern Zetasizer). The structure and physicochemical properties of the samples were measured by using UV-vis spectra (UV1800PC, Jinghua), ATR-FTIR spectra (Nicolet iS50, Thermo), PL spectra (F98, Lengguang), an electronic balance (ME204, Mettler Toledo), TGA (TG209, NETZSTH), XRD (Rigaku D/max-rA), EPR (A300/10-12, Bruker) and XPS (Escalab 250Xi, Thermo).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Preparation and characterization of photocatalysts
The novel plasmonic photocatalysts of TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers were fabricated by electrostatic assembly and in situ reduction methods, as shown in Fig. 1a. The positively charged PEI is first modified around the negatively charged TiO2 fibers to form a TiO2/PEI complex via electrostatic interaction, and then Ag ions are in situ reduced by PEI (PEI provides the reducing power) to generate Ag nanoparticles on the surface of the TiO2/PEI complex. No external reducing agent was required in this process. In Fig. S1a,† zeta potentials of the rutile TiO2 and TiO2/PEI complex were around −5 mV and +16 mV, respectively, indicating that the PEI was successfully assembled around the rutile TiO2 surface. To further quantify the existence of PEI in the TiO2/PEI composite, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectra (ATR-FTIR) were obtained for TiO2 and the TiO2/PEI composite. As shown in Fig. S1b,† unlike TiO2, TiO2/PEI shows a more obvious weight loss from 35 to 800 °C under a N2 atmosphere in TGA, further confirming the presence of PEI in TiO2/PEI. Peaks at 1127, 1462, 1646, and 2859 cm−1 can be observed for TiO2/PEI (Fig. S2†), which correspond to the C–N bond, –CH2 bending vibration, amine groups, and –CH2 stretching vibration. These observations reveal the existence of PEI in TiO2/PEI.

The morphologies, structures and element distributions of as-prepared rutile TiO2 and TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), UV-vis spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) characterization studies. As shown in Fig. 1b, the rutile TiO2 fibers prepared via the ethylene glycol method present a one-dimensional fiber structure with a smooth surface and uniform morphology, which provides favorable conditions for the modification of PEI and the growth of AgNPs. Fig. 1c shows a typical SEM image of the TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers with a rough and nanoparticle-strewn surface, which may suggest the successful assembly of PEI and formation of AgNPs. EDS mapping (Fig. 1d) in the SEM selection area shows the bright colors of Ti, O, N and Ag elements in TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers, indicating the existence of these elements. The distribution of Ti and O was spread throughout the fibers, demonstrating the successful synthesis of TiO2 fibers. The N element was homogeneously distributed on the surface of the fiber, suggesting that PEI was wrapped around TiO2 fibers. The Ag element was distributed uniformly on the surface of TiO2/PEI fibers, demonstrating the successful fabrication of the TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers. UV-vis spectra (Fig. 2a) of the TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers show two characteristic absorption bands at around 295 nm and 400 nm, which correspond to the absorption peaks of TiO2 and AgNPs, indicating the creation of AgNPs and the integrity of the TiO2 structure in the TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers. XPS characterization was applied to further research the chemical valence of the AgNPs within the TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers. For Ag 3d (Fig. 2b), its high-resolution spectrum shows two divided peaks at 374.6 and 368.6 eV, which correspond to the binding energies of Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2, respectively. As shown, the shape of the Ag 3d peaks indicates the existence of Ag0, without significant Ag+ and Ag2+ contributions. Fig. 2c shows the corresponding XRD pattern for a TiO2/PEI/AgNP powder sample on a silicon wafer. Diffraction peaks at 2θ = 27.48°, 36.13°, 41.30°, 54.37° and 56.91° were observed, which match well with the {110}, {101}, {111}, {211} and {220} planes of rutile TiO2 in standard card (JCPDS no. 88-1175), respectively, verifying that the TiO2 fibers were the rutile structure. Peaks at 2θ = 42.93° and 48.18° were also observed, which may be ascribed to the {221} and {231} planes of brookite TiO2 in standard card (JCPDS no. 29-1360), respectively. Whereas, two characteristic peaks at 2θ = 38° and 64.39° were also observed, corresponding to the Ag {111} and Ag {200} planes, respectively, demonstrating that the AgNP has a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure. Fig. 2d–f show the representative TEM and HRTEM images obtained from the TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers, further verifying that TiO2 has a fiber structure and the AgNPs are scattered on the fiber surface. As displayed in the HRTEM images, the well-defined lattice fringes with a 0.26 nm fringe spacing of TiO2 is detected, which is consistent with the {101} crystal plane of TiO2, and the lattice fringe spacing of AgNPs is calculated to be 0.235 nm, which is attributed to the dspacing of the Ag {111} crystal plane. The results demonstrate that high-crystalline TiO2 fibers and AgNPs were successfully constructed. Moreover, the AgNP is wrapped by the PEI coating, suggesting that the AgNP is grown in PEI coating and attaches to the surface of TiO2 fibers by PEI.

To deeply understand the generation of the AgNP within the TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers, a study was performed with different concentrations of AgNO3 solution. Fig. 2g–i show the SEM images of the TiO2/PEI/AgNP prepared by using 10 mM, 20 mM and 40 mM of AgNO3 solution, respectively. The AgNP is formed with a regular spherical structure when the concentration of AgNO3 solution is 10 mM. For a higher concentration of AgNO3 solution, fewer intact spherical Ag nanoparticles are observed. These results indicate that 10 mM of AgNO3 solution is more suitable to form spherical AgNPs around the surface of TiO2.
3.2 Photocatalytic H2O2 production over the TiO2/PEI/AgNP photocatalyst
The photocatalytic H2O2 production activities of the photocatalysts were evaluated by suspending the as-prepared samples in pure water with air under simulated solar irradiation (Fig. 3a). Different concentrations of commercial H2O2 detected by the iodometry method42 are used as calibration curves to determine the amount of H2O2 produced during the photocatalytic process (Fig. S3†). For the rutile TiO2 and TiO2/PEI fibers, the concentration of H2O2 within 21 min irradiation were only 23.7 μM and 23.2 μM, respectively. In stark contrast, by growing AgNPs on the TiO2/PEI surface, the H2O2 production over the TiO2/PEI/AgNP suspension reaches more than 561.5 μM within 21 min of irradiation, which is around 24 times higher than that of the rutile TiO2 and TiO2/PEI fibers under the same experimental conditions. To demonstrate the important role of the PEI component, a control group of TiO2/Ag without PEI was prepared. As shown in Fig. S4a,† there are no Ag nanoparticles generated on the surface of TiO2 fibers. The photocatalytic performance of H2O2 production (Fig. S4b†) by TiO2/Ag was only 294.1 μM within 21 min of irradiation, which is much lower than that of the TiO2/PEI/AgNP. These results indicated that the PEI component played a key role in producing Ag nanoparticles and accelerating photocatalytic production of H2O2.

(b) The corresponding H2O2 formation (Kf) and decomposition (Kd) rate constants of (a). (c) Photocatalytic decomposition of H2O2 by TiO2, TiO2/PEI and TiO2/PEI/AgNPs, respectively. (d) Photocatalytic H2O2 production of TiO2/PEI/AgNPs at different pH values. 
More importantly, the photocatalytic H2O2 production activities of the TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers were compared to those in other latest reports,3,43–47 with the results summarized in Table S1.† Obviously, the TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers exhibit superior performance for H2O2 production which is much better than that of some cutting edge photocatalysts under the same conditions, which suggest that the TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers have possibilities for direct H2O2 industrial production in pure water and air. It is worth noting that the H2O2 production process usually suffers from rapid H2O2 decomposition on the surface of the photocatalysts. Thus, a study on detecting the concentration of H2O2 was performed to appraise the behaviors of H2O2 production by the competition between H2O2 formation and the decomposition rate constant. The overall H2O2 production can be expressed as formula (1):48,49 [H2O2] = (kf /kd){1 − exp(−kdt)}(1)where Kf and Kd are the formation and decomposition rate constants of H2O2, respectively. The fitting results are displayed in Fig. 3b. The TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers obtained the highest Kf (535.1 μM min−1) and the lowest Kd (0.141 min−1), suggesting the best performance of H2O2 production. To further clarify the H2O2 decomposition behaviors, the experiments on H2O2 decomposition were carried out by using 0.5 mM of initial H2O2 under dark field or sunlight (Fig. S5† and 3c). Under darkfield conditions, the H2O2 mixed with the TiO2/PEI/AgNP suspension is only decomposed by 7.2% within 3 h. Even under sunlight conditions, the H2O2 mixed with the TiO2/PEI/AgNP suspension is decomposed by 29.1% within 3 h, which is well below those of the rutile TiO2 and TiO2/PEI with about a 96% decomposition rate. These results confirm that TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers are beneficial for the inhibition of H2O2 decomposition and the promotion of H2O2 production.
The photocatalytic H2O2 production in different pH values is also evaluated (Fig. 3d). Whether in pH 4 or pH 10, the TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers show poor activity, which is much lower than that at pH 7. These results might be caused by the intrinsic reaction mechanism of the TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers which is dependent on the pH value.
3.3 Optical properties of the catalysts and identification of reactive oxygen species
The reasons why the TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers exhibit such excellent H2O2 production without any sacrificial agents are further investigated. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) spectra and color change of different as-prepared samples were measured, as shown in Fig. 4a. It can be seen that the TiO2/PEI/AgNP presents much broader sun light responses and darker color than TiO2, indicating strong sun light harvesting. The band gaps of the TiO2 and TiO2/PEI/AgNP were calculated to be 2.85 and 2.13 eV by using the Kubelka–Munk equation (Fig. 4b and c), respectively. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of different photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 4d. It can be found that the PL intensity of the TiO2/PEI/AgNP at 417 nm is far below that of the TiO2 and TiO2/PEI, indicating an effective separation effect of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were obtained here to monitor reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced over the surface of the TiO2/PEI/AgNP. As shown in Fig. 4e, the TiO2/PEI/AgNP exhibits six typical signals of DMPO-˙O2− after 10 min of sunlight irradiation, indicating that a lot of superoxide anions (˙O2−) are generated in photocatalysis for 2e− two-step redox reactions. When p-benzoquinone (0.5 mM, ˙O2− scavenger) was introduced into the process of photocatalysis under sunlight, H2O2 production was completely suppressed for the TiO2/PEI/AgNP, as shown in Fig. S6.† These results certified that ˙O2− plays a key role in H2O2 production and agreed well with a two-step single-electron pathway to synthesize H2O2. Fig. 4f shows four characteristic peaks of DMPO-˙OH for the TiO2/PEI/AgNP aqueous suspension under sunlight irradiation, indicative of the formation of a large amount of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) in the process of the photocatalytic H2O2 production.

3.4 Mechanism discussion
To understand the roles of each component in TiO2/PEI/AgNPs, the corresponding model TiO2 and TiO2/PEI/AgNPs (without or with O2 adsorption) were constructed through density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. S7 and S8†). The optimized structure of TiO2/PEI/AgNPs confirms that the initial semiconductor structure is well maintained after PEI modification and AgNP growth compared to that of pure TiO2. For gaining further insights into the electron transfer properties, the charge difference and Bader charges of TiO2 and TiO2/PEI/AgNPs were calculated (Fig. 5a and b), respectively. The results show the charge accumulation and consumption in TiO2/PEI/AgNPs are greatly enhanced, indicating that more effective electron transfer occurs. The charge depletion near the AgNP component was obvious, indicating that a large number of electrons might be conducted to the oxygen surface through AgNPs. The Bader charge from TiO2/PEI/AgNPs to O2 is −0.657e, which is 15 times higher than that from TiO2 to O2, verifying the easy transfer of electrons between TiO2/PEI/AgNPs and O2. Therefore, TiO2/PEI/AgNPs exhibit dramatically improved photocatalytic H2O2 production. Furthermore, the negative adsorption energy of O2 on the structure of TiO2/PEI/AgNPs (−1.308 eV) is larger compared to that on TiO2 (−0.218 eV), suggesting that more O2 molecules are preferably adsorbed on the surface of the TiO2/PEI/AgNP, which in turn favours H2O2 production.
 Fig. 5  The differential charge densities of (a) TiO2 and (b) TiO2/PEI/AgNPs which adsorbed O2 molecules, respectively. Yellow and blue regions represent the accumulation and depletion of electrona at 0.001 Å e−3 isosurface value, respectively. Eads is the total adsorption energy of O2. qO2 shows the accumulated electron charge on O2. C, N, H, O, Ti, and Ag atoms are represented as grey, blue, orange, red, white and purple spheres, respectively. (c) The reaction pathway of H2O2 production catalyzed by TiO2/PEI/AgNPs. 
Based on the above analysis, a plausible reaction pathway for photocatalytic H2O2 production by the TiO2/PEI/AgNP is proposed (Fig. 5c). A two-step single-electron reduction of O2 can be used here to form H2O2, as shown in eqn (2) and (3). Under sunlight irradiation, the photoinduced e− and h+ are generated in the TiO2 component in the TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers. Benefiting from the AgNPs interposed between TiO2 and PEI, the e− generated by TiO2 and the high-energy e− generated by plasmonic AgNPs will be rapidly conducted through AgNPs to the absorbed O2 molecules for generating ˙O2−; thus, the separation of photogenerated carriers is improved. Meanwhile, due to the presence of the PEI component, the proton from pure water can be enriched for facilitating efficient H2O2 production and the generated H2O2 can reduce the contact with the TiO2 surface to slow down the rate of in situ decomposition. In addition, the OH− from pure water can further inhibit the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers by combining with h+ to generate ˙OH, as shown in eqn (4).
To further explore the application of the generated ˙OH, the TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers were used for photocatalytic TC degradation. As shown in Fig. S9a,† the photocatalytic efficiency of the TiO2/PEI/AgNP was 66.8% within 36 min, demonstrating that the TiO2/PEI/AgNP has remarkable response to sunlight and the degradation effect of TC. Quenching tests were performed to O2 + e− → ˙O2−(2) ˙O2− + 2H+ + e− → H2O2(3) OH− + h+ → ˙OH(4)indicate the contribution of ˙OH and ˙O2− during the process of TC degradation. tert-Butanol (TBA) and p-benzoquinone (BQ) serve as free radical scavengers for ˙OH and ˙O2−, respectively. As shown in Fig. S9b,† the photocatalytic degradation rates were all suppressed after the introduction of radical scavengers. The results demonstrated that ˙OH can combine with ˙O2− to degrade TC efficiently.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we reported a novel and facile approach to prepare an efficient plasmonic photocatalyst via electrostatic assembly and in situ polymer reduction for highly efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production without sacrificial reagents in air and pure water. This investigation and DFT simulation revealed that the AgNP component in TiO2/PEI/AgNP fibers rapidly conducts the high-energy electrons from AgNPs and photogenerated electrons from TiO2 to O2 for H2O2 formation via 2e− two-step redox reactions. And then the PEI component accelerates the capture of H+ in water to promote H2O2 formation and OH− from water can combine with h+ to further accelerate the rapid separation of photogenerated carriers. The PEI component also acted as a blocking agent to slow down the probability that the H2O2 generated in the photocatalytic process directly comes into contact with the TiO2 surface, thereby further improving the yield of H2O2. This study provided a new insight into the design and preparation of a plasmonic photocatalyst via self-assembly and the in situ reduction method, and could be a generic approach to develop superior H2O2 photocatalysts.
