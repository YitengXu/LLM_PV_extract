    , Accepted 27th May 2023First published on 31st May 2023AbstractThe huge market for Internet of Things (IoT) devices brings unprecedented opportunities for indoor photovoltaics (PV). Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the best candidates owing to their outstanding low-light conversion capability. However, their performance still suffers from trap-assisted recombination in cells, especially under low light levels. Here, for the first time, we developed and comprehensively investigated the impact of EuCl3 doping on the indoor PV performance of triple-cation (bandgap of 1.58 eV) n–i–p PSCs at various lux (lx) illuminance levels. EuCl3 doping reduced both volatile iodine (I)0 species and unreacted residual PbI2, resulting in the formation of larger perovskite grains, more uniform films and fewer defects. Leakage currents were more than ten times lower resulting in suppressed carrier recombination and increased shunt resistance, with doubling of carrier lifetimes. Finally, the indoor power conversion efficiency (PCE) jumped to 25.0% from 22.8% at 200 lx, and to 30.0% from 27.4% at 1000 lx with the incorporation of EuCl3. Furthermore, under the thermal stress test at 85 °C, t50 (the time at which PCE halves) was more than double that of cells fabricated without EuCl3. This work opens up new avenues for realizing efficient and stable indoor PSCs for Internet of Things applications.
1 Introduction
Low-power Internet of Things (IoT) devices (average consumption of 20–50 μW) and sensor networks are becoming widespread in our daily life, creating a need to develop self-powered wireless electronics.1–3 Photovoltaic (PV) cells are the best choice to satisfy these requirements due to their ability to convert low intensity light into electrical power. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the best candidates owing to their good mechanical flexibility, low weight, low cost and high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) especially under low light conditions.4–10
Optical powers from indoor ambient light in buildings are 100–1000 times lower than under standard test conditions (STC, 100 mW cm−2).11,12 Hence, in indoor photovoltaics (IPV), photogenerated charge carriers are significantly reduced and they suffer more significantly from Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) trap-assisted recombination, which leads to higher power loss.13–15
Extensive research has been carried out to limit the generation of trap states by inserting (doping) additives in the perovskite layer, with the vast majority only under STC. These include organic molecules such as Lewis bases (e.g. pyridine, urea, and thiophene),16,17 Lewis acids (e.g. fullerene),18 quaternary ammonium halides,19 hydrazide derivatives (e.g. benzamide),20 and inorganic cations such as potassium,21 aluminum,22 nickel,23 guanidinium,24 copper and europium ions.25–28
The little literature that exists on IPV has demonstrated doping and passivation to be effective under indoor illumination. Additives include lead oxalate, tetramethylammonium chloride and guanidinium iodide leading to improvements in power conversion efficiency (PCE) between 10 and 50% and over in relative terms.6,29,30 More materials need to be studied to have a palette that can be used for the express requirements of indoor PSCs and different perovskites whilst also improving their operational stability.
Recently Eu(acac)3 was added to the precursor inks in MAPbI3 and studied only under STC.27 Eu(acac)3 was obtained by dissolving Eu2O3 in HCl and then adding acetylacetone. During this process, the pH of the solution needs to be controlled, and the preparation process is complicated. EuCl3 which is a simpler, more readily available and less-costly compound has not been used as a bulk additive in the triple-cation perovskite although Chen et al. incorporated it, not into the perovskite ink, but into the SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and found trap defect passivation.28
Here, we doped EuCl3 into the triple-cation perovskite bulk, and comprehensively investigated its impact on the indoor PV parameters at 200, 500, and 1000 lux (lx) illuminance levels (found in homes, offices and supermarkets, respectively) which are more sensitive to the quality of the films compared to those under STC. EuCl3 incorporated effectively improves film morphology, and suppresses the charge carrier recombination leading to a longer carrier lifetime, thereby increasing the indoor PCE considerably as well as providing much superior thermal stability compared to the control devices.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Photovoltaic performance of EuCl3 incorporated perovskite solar cells
Planar-type perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a configuration of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au were fabricated (Fig. 1a), where the triple cation perovskite layer was incorporated with different contents of EuCl3 (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mM, abbreviated as 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 Eu3+). The indoor PV performance of the devices with an optimized EuCl3 doping concentration is significantly higher than that of the control devices at all indoor illuminance values (Fig. S1–S3 and Tables S1–S3†). At 200 lx, the PCE of the 0.25 Eu3+ device increased to 25.0% from 22.8%, with VOC increasing to 0.86 V from 0.82 V (Fig. 1b, and S4†). The JSC values measured from the current density–voltage (J–V) scan were within 19% of the value of the integrated JSC calculated from the EQE curve and irradiance values at 200 lx (Fig. S5†), which is within the generally accepted <20% difference between the calculated and experimental JSC,31,32 and our indoor measurement system resolution.33,34 At 1000 lx, the improvement is even more pronounced, with the PCE reaching 30.0% (a stabilized PCE of 29.2%) from 27.4%, with a corresponding increase of VOC to 0.91 V from 0.86 V (Fig. 1b, c and S6†). Under 1 sun conditions, the PCE also increased from 17.8% to 19.4% (Fig. S7, S8 and Table S4†). External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. S9†) were used to calculate the integrated current density (JSC) from 1 sun photon flux, which is comparable (<5% discrepancy for all cells) to that of the JSC value obtained from J–V spectra. Since previous studies have shown that Eu3+ doping can significantly improve long-term stability, especially thermal stability, we performed thermal stability tests at 85 °C.27,28,35 The thermal stability of 0.25 Eu3+ devices is remarkably superior to that of the control cells. At 200 lx the cells maintained 55% of their initial PCE after annealing at 85 °C for 470 h, while the control cells retained only 25.6% of their initial PCE. t50 (182 h for control and >470 h for 0.25 Eu3+ cells) has more than doubled when doping the precursor inks with EuCl3 (Fig. 1d). A similar trend in thermal stability was found under 1 sun characterization conditions (Fig. S10†). This stability test corresponds to protocol ISOS-D-2.36

2.2 Effect of EuCl3 doping on film morphology and photoelectrical properties
Top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows that the morphology of perovskite films was modified upon doping with EuCl3 (Fig. 2a, b and S11†). The average grain size increased from 287 ± 24 nm for the control film to 322 ± 18 nm for the 0.25 Eu3+-doped film (Fig. S12†). PbI2 that has not reacted in the synthesis of the perovskite layer, can be noted in all the films as determined from the 2θ of 12.8° XRD peaks in Fig. 2c. We note that the incorporation of EuCl3 reduces the peaks of residual PbI2 (Fig. 2b and c), which a number of studies have determined to be detrimental to the PV performance.37–39 The intensity ratio of PbI2/(001) diffraction peaks drops from 0.40 to 0.31 from the control to the 0.25 Eu3+ films. Furthermore, the intensity ratio of the (001)/(012) diffraction peak increases from 1.41 to 1.54, which can be mainly ascribed to preferential grain growth along the (001) plane with enhanced crystallinity resulting in improved electron transport of photogenerated carriers towards the electrodes.40,41 We did not observe significant shifts in diffraction peaks, nor external diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern, which indicates that Eu3+ ions may not be incorporated within the perovskite crystal lattice.42 The UV-visible absorption spectrum shows that all samples have similar absorption onsets with an optical bandgap of 1.58 eV (Fig. S13†) and that of steady-state photoluminescence (PL) emission (Fig. 2d) was Eg,PL = 1.60 eV. These 20 meV differences are consistent with the systematic errors mentioned by Siebentritt et al.43 The absorption edge extracted from the EQE spectrum was Eg,PV = 1.56 eV (Fig. S9†). The slightly lower Eg,PV from EQE spectra is due to excitonic and/or thermal broadening, as well as device geometry.44,45 Additionally, the PL spectra (Fig. 2d) of perovskite films show considerably higher intensity for EuCl3-doped perovskite films suggesting a reduced trap-state density which is advantageous for the PV performance. This is most likely attributed to the Eu3+ ions acting over the bulk of perovskite films reducing trap defects significantly.27,28 The highest PL is found for the 0.25 mM doping concentration, a sign that the optimal crystallization rate is found to positively affect the quality of films.26 Normalized time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were fitted by using the bi-exponential function (Fig. 2e) and the extracted charge carrier lifetimes τi, and corresponding constants Ai are summarized in Table S5.† The average decay lifetimes (τavg) were calculated using the following equation: (1)

(e) Normalized time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of the control and 0.25 Eu3+ incorporated perovskite films. 
The average charge carrier lifetime of the 0.25 Eu3+ perovskite film was 345 ns, which is 1.5 times higher than that of the control (230 ns). The significant enhancements in charge carrier lifetimes indicate a considerable suppression of nonradiative recombination after incorporation of EuCl3, which is critical for improving photovoltaic performance under low-light conditions which is more sensitive to defects.6,46
In order to help elucidate the role of EuCl3, we carried out X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).27,47Fig. 3a shows Pb peaks, corresponding to Pb 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 electronic orbitals. We notice that with 0.25 Eu3+ addition, the peaks lie exactly where Pb2+ 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 should be as indicated by the red dotted lines (i.e. at 142.8 eV and 137.7 eV).27 The peaks of the control film are at slightly higher binding energies which is indicative of less undercoordinated Pb2+ in the 0.25 Eu3+ film as suggested by Zhang et al.48Fig. 3d shows that the I/Pb ratio, calculated as the peak ratio between I and Pb peaks in the full spectrum range (Fig. 3c), is higher in the 0.25 Eu3+ film, 2.9 instead of 2.6. As noted in ref. 27, this should indicate that less volatile I0 species are produced in the corresponding film. The binding energy (BE) of I 3d3/2 further confirms this argument, wherein it is shifted toward lower values in the 0.25 Eu3+ sample (Fig. 3b), thus showing that I− was well preserved in these films.27

To obtain deeper insights into the effect of EuCl3 incorporation on improving the PV performance of devices, we performed other studies. According to the Shockley–Queisser model, the relationship between JSC and VOC is described as: (2)where J0 represents the reverse dark current density, q represents the electron charge, n represents the diode ideality factor, k represents the Boltzmann constant, and T represents the temperature. As observed in Fig. 1b, the JSC values of both control and 0.25 Eu3+ based devices are very similar. Therefore, the increase in the VOC is attributed to the lowering of the J0. In fact, the 0.25 Eu3+ device exhibits a leakage current density which is more than an order of magnitude lower compared to that of the control (Fig. 4a), which suggests suppressed charge carrier recombination.46,49 Moreover, the shunt resistance (RSH) values of the 0.25 Eu3+ doped device (223.2 Ω cm2) are significantly higher than that of the control device (162.9 Ω cm2), which is paramount at low light levels found indoors since the photogeneration rate of charge carriers is low.46 The ideality factor n is extracted from the dependence of the VOC on light intensity (Fig. 4b) based on the following equation:50 (3)where n represents the ideality factor and Φ represents illumination light intensity. When n is close to 2, trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination is dominant; when n is close to 1, weak recombination mainly comes from free electrons and holes.50 The ideality factor n was 1.89kT/q for the control device, and decreased to 1.55kT/q for the 0.25 Eu3+ doped devices. This 18% lowering is comparable, and even greater, to the lowering observed with the additions of Rb+, Cs+ and Na+ alkali metals reported by Tang et al. (lowering between 7% and 16%).51 The lowering of n indicates suppression of trap states and corresponding SRH carrier recombination.52 Ideality factors close to 1 are particularly important for indoor PV performance, where photocurrents are not much greater than recombination currents which limit open circuit voltages achievable.50 Transient photovoltage (TPV) decay experiments (Fig. 4c) support this picture as well as the results on film quality shown in Fig. 2a, showing that the 0.25 Eu3+ based device has longer carrier lifetimes (nearly double that of the control device). All these factors together contribute to the improvement of the PV performance of EuCl3 doped cells.

3 Conclusion
We have demonstrated an effective method to improve film quality of perovskite (triple-cation with a 1.58 eV bandgap) semiconductors in n–i–p solar cells, leading to enhanced indoor PV performance. We observed that EuCl3 incorporation in the perovskite bulk modified the perovskite morphology with an increase in the average grain size of about 35 nm. XPS analysis indicated that EuCl3 incorporation in the film reduced the volatile I0 species. We further found that EuCl3 doping in cells reduces leakage current density by more than an order of magnitude compared to control cells. Moreover, an EuCl3-doped cell exhibited a lower ideality factor than the control (from 1.89 to 1.55kT/q), indicating suppressed carrier recombination and decreased trap states. The charge carrier lifetimes in these films doubled. As a result, the indoor PCE was boosted to 25.0% from 22.8% at 200 lx, and to 30.0% from 27.4% at 1000 lx. Under the thermal stress test at 85 °C, t50 (the time at which PCE halves) has more than doubled when doping the precursor inks with EuCl3. Our work provides insights into trap passivation for enhancing the PV performance of PSCs especially for applications where the reduction of trap states is crucial, i.e. in their application for indoor and low-light conditions.

Lead iodide (PbI2, 99.999%), lead bromide (PbBr2, 98%), cesium iodide (CsI, 99%) and europium(III) chloride (EuCl3, 99.99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Formamidinium iodide (FAI) and methylammonium bromide (MABr) were purchased from GreatCell Solar. Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.5%) and chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Spiro-OMeTAD (≥99.8%) was purchased from Borun NewMaterial Technology Ltd. 4-Tert-butylpyridine (tBP) and Li-TFSI were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
4.2 Device fabrication
First, indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrates (25 mm × 25 mm) were cleaned with sequential sonication in deionized water, acetone, isopropanol and deionized water for 15 minutes each. After drying, they were subjected to UV–ozone treatment for 15 minutes. Tin oxide (SnO2) solution was prepared by diluting SnO2 (15% in H2O colloidal dispersion) in deionized water (at a volume ratio of 1:5). Then, a SnO2 layer was spin coated on ITO/glass substrates at 2500 rpm for 30 s followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min in air.
The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing PbI2, PbBr2, FAI, MABr, and CSI in anhydrous DMF:DMSO 7:3 (v/v) with a chemical formula of Cs0.05MA0.14FA0.81PbI2.7Br0.3.53 For EuCl3 doped perovskite solution preparation, a stock solution of EuCl3 dissolved in DMF (0.02 M) was added to the perovskite precursor solution in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 0.75 mM. The precursor solution was spin coated on the SnO2 substrate at 4000 rpm for 35 s followed by a dripping of 185 μL CB when 15 s were left, and was then followed by an annealing process at 100 °C for 15 min. After the annealing procedure, 72.3 mg ml−1 spiro-OMeTAD in 1 ml CB with 28.8 μl TBP and 17.5 μl Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (520 mg ml−1) was spin coated on the perovskite films at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 100 nm of a gold top electrode was thermally evaporated on the spiro layer.
4.3 Characterization
The top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi SU8000 scanning electron microscope. The grain size was analyzed using the software Nano Measurer 1.2. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were obtained on a UV-vis 2550 spectrophotometer from Shimadzu. The XRD data were obtained by using a Rigaku SmartLab SE. The PL data were collected with a LabRAM ARAMIS. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded in a Vacuum Generators VG-450 ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with an Al Kα radiation source. The position of the Fermi level (EF) was determined with an accuracy of 50 meV by photoemission from the metallic sample holder. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves under one sun illumination were measured by using a source meter (Keithley 2400) equipped with a calibrated solar simulator (ABET Sun 2000, Class A) providing standard test conditions (AM1.5G, 1000 W m−2) at room temperature. For indoor J–V measurement, a white LED (Osram Parathom Classic P25) was applied as the light source, and the light intensity was calibrated to obtain specific illuminance (e.g., 200, 500, and 1000 lx) by using a luxmeter (NIST-traceable calibrated Digisense 20250-00). More details can be found in our previous studies.33 In order to complete all measurements at the three different illuminance levels indoors (200, 500, and 1000 lx) within one day, one substrate (with 4 separate cells) was measured for each EuCl3 doping composition. The J–V curve of each device both under one sun illumination and LED light were obtained by masking the active area (0.09 cm2) using a black tape mask. Time-resolved PL (TRPL), dark current density versus voltage (dark J–V), light intensity dependence of VOC and transient photovoltage (TPV) decay were collected by using a modular testing platform (Arkeo-Cicci Research s.r.l.).34,49
