    , Accepted 8th November 2013First published on 2nd December 2013AbstractMo-doped BiVO4 electrodes were prepared by an electrochemical route for use as photoanodes in a photoelectrochemical cell. The purpose of Mo-doping was to improve the electron transport properties, which in turn can increase the electron–hole separation yield. The poor electron–hole separation yield was known to be one of the main limiting factors for BiVO4-based photoanodes. The electrochemical route provided an effective way of doping BiVO4, and the optimally doped sample, BiV0.97Mo0.03O4, increased the electron–hole separation yield from 0.23 to 0.57 at 0.6 V vs. RHE, which is a record high separation yield achieved for BiVO4-based photoanodes. As a result, BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 generated impressive photocurrents, for example, 2 mA cm−2 at a potential as low as 0.4 V vs. RHE for sulfite oxidation, which has fast oxidation kinetics and, therefore, the loss of holes by surface recombination is negligible. For photooxidation of water, BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 was paired with FeOOH as an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) to improve the poor catalytic ability of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 for water oxidation. The resulting BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH photoanodes generated a significantly improved photocurrent for water oxidation compared to previous reported results, but the photocurrent of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH for water oxidation could not reach the photocurrent of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 for sulfite oxidation. In order to examine the cause, the effects of Mo-doping on the interaction between BiVO4 and FeOOH and the effects of FeOOH on the electron–hole separation yield of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 were investigated in detail, which provided new insights into semiconductor–OEC interactions.
Introduction
Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4), which is an n-type semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.4 eV, has been recently recognized as a promising photoanode for use in a photoelectrochemical cell.1,2 The most distinctive advantage of BiVO4 for use in photoelectrochemical water splitting, compared to other oxides having comparable bandgap energies, is the position of its conduction band edge just short of the potential for H2 evolution. This enables the photocurrent onset of BiVO4 to occur near 0 V vs. RHE, which makes it feasible to shift the maximum power point to the low bias region (i.e., <0.6 V vs. RHE).2 This is a highly advantageous feature for increasing the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency.3
One major limitation of BiVO4 in photocurrent generation has been identified to be its low electron–hole separation yield, which does not exceed 0.3, even at a potential as high as 1.2 V vs. RHE.4,5 Various factors can affect the separation yield but the poor electron transport of BiVO4 appears to be one of the main drawbacks, considering that BiVO4-based photoanodes perform significantly better when back-side illumination was used instead of front-side illumination.4–7 Front-side illumination generates electron–hole pairs near the BiVO4–electrolyte interface, requiring the electrons to travel farther to reach the back contact (i.e., FTO) than the holes must travel to reach the surface of the electrode. On the other hand, back-side illumination generates electron–hole pairs near the back contact requiring the holes to travel a longer distance to reach the surface of the electrode.7 Therefore, when electron transport is slower than hole transport and is a major limiting factor for electron–hole separation, back-side illumination would generate a much higher photocurrent.4–8
The poor photoelectrochemical performance of BiVO4 when front-side illumination is used limits the use of BiVO4 for the construction of tandem cells, where BiVO4 is layered on top of a smaller bandgap photocathode. In this case, to maximize photon absorption by both photocathode and photoanode, front-side illumination, where the light is first passed through the BiVO4 anode with the larger bandgap, is necessary.9 Therefore, improving the electron transport of BiVO4 to enhance the electron–hole separation yield as well as making the photocurrent generated by front-side illumination comparable to that generated by back-side illumination would be highly beneficial to further advance the construction of BiVO4-based photoelectrochemical cells.
Increasing the carrier density by doping is a straightforward method to improve the electron transport of BiVO4. Therefore, various doping studies have been previously performed on BiVO4.2,4,8,10–23 In this study, we report a new electrochemical synthesis method to prepare Mo-doped BiVO4 photoanodes, which provides a highly effective way of doping, resulting in a record high electron–hole separation yield, particularly in the low bias region (e.g., 0.57 at 0.6 V vs. RHE). This change leads to a marked increase in the fill factor, resulting in a considerable increase in photocurrent generation compared to previously-reported doped BiVO4 systems. The Mo-doped BiVO4 photoanodes reported in this study also show outstanding performance when front-side illumination is used, making them highly attractive for future use in the construction of tandem cells that require front-side illumination.
In this study, we examined the effect of Mo-doping for the photooxidation of both sulfite and water. Since sulfite oxidation has much faster hole injection kinetics, investigation for sulfite photooxidation can enable us to examine the effect of Mo doping on photocurrent generation that is not limited by the poor water oxidation kinetics of the BiVO4 surface. By comparing photocurrents generated for sulfite oxidation and water oxidation of the undoped and Mo-doped BiVO4 photoanodes, with and without the presence of an iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC), various new insights into the effects of Mo-doping on the BiVO4–FeOOH junction and electron–hole separation yield are provided.
Experimental
Chemicals and materials
Bismuth(III) nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, ≥98.0%), vanadium(IV) oxide sulfate (VOSO4·xH2O, 97%), and sodium acetate (CH3COONa, >99.0%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Nitric acid (HNO3, 68.0–70.0%), potassium hydroxide (KOH, pellets, ≥97.0%), and sodium sulfite (Na2SO3, >98.0%) were obtained from Mallinckrodt. Molybdenum metal (spherical, −170 mesh, 99.5%), platinum black (Hispec™ 1000), and iron(II) chloride (FeCl2·4H2O, 99%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Potassium phosphate monobasic (KH2PO4, ACS grade) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%) were obtained from Fisher and EMD Millipore, respectively. All chemicals and materials were used as purchased. Solutions were prepared using high purity water (Barnstead E-Pure water purification system, resistivity >18 MΩ cm). Glass slides coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) were purchased from Hartford Glass, Incorporated.
Solution preparation for the synthesis of Mo-doped BiVO4 electrodes
Bi(III) precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 2.42 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in 50 mL conc. HNO3 solution (30 wt%). This solution was diluted to 400–450 mL with DI water, and 82 g of sodium acetate were added, raising the pH to ∼5.1. The pH of the solution was adjusted to pH 4.7 with concentrated HNO3 before more DI water was added to a final volume of 500 mL. The final concentrations of Bi(NO3)3 and acetate were 10 mM and 2 M, respectively. Acetate serves to stabilize otherwise insoluble Bi(III) ions at pH 4.7. This mildly acidic pH condition must be used because at pH lower than 2 where Bi(III) is soluble, no film can be formed while at pH higher than 5, V(IV) is no longer soluble and precipitates in the bulk solution.
A 1 M Mo(VI) precursor solution was prepared by slow addition of 0.97 g molybdenum powder to 10 mL 30% hydrogen peroxide in a cool-water bath. The solution was stirred for 1 hour to completely dissolve the Mo. After its dissolution, 2 mg of platinum black powder were added to decompose residual peroxide for at least 12 hours while stirring. The Pt black was then filtered, leaving a yellow-green Mo solution.
To deposit undoped BiVO4, 50 mL of Bi(III)–acetate solution were heated to 70 °C, and immediately before deposition, VOSO4 powder was added to make a 35 mM VOSO4 solution. (Prolonged heating of the solution after the addition of VOSO4 caused bulk precipitation of green powders.) For the deposition of Mo-based BiVO4, various amounts of Mo solution were added after the addition of VOSO4. The final Mo concentrations used in this study were 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 mM (see Table 1).

Preparation of BiVO4 and Mo-doped BiVO4 electrodes
A standard three-electrode cell was used for electrodeposition. An FTO working electrode, a Ag/AgCl (4 M KCl) reference, and a platinum counter electrode were used for the experiments. The platinum counter electrode was prepared by layering 100 nm of platinum on top of a 30 nm titanium adhesion layer on a cleaned glass slide by e-beam evaporation.
A VMP2 multichannel potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research) was used for electrodeposition and all subsequent electrochemical studies. The anodic depositions of Bi–V–Mo–O and Bi–V–O films were performed potentiostatically at 1.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl at 70 °C until a total charge of 0.55 C cm−2 is passed. The average current density over the ∼5 min deposition was 1.8 mA cm−2. Under these conditions, VO2+ was oxidized to VO2+ and coprecipitated with Bi(III) to form Bi–V–O films.6 The as-deposited films were amorphous with a Bi:V ratio of 2:3 determined by EDX analysis.6 (For Mo to V ratios obtained from plating solutions containing various amounts of Mo, see Table 1 in the main text.) The as-deposited film is most likely Bi4V6O21, a stable compound in the Bi–V–O family composed of Bi(III) and V(V) ions with a stoichiometry matching our EDX data.24,25 The as-deposited films were converted to crystalline Mo-doped BiVO4 and amorphous V2O5 by annealing at 500 °C for 1 hour in air (ramping rate = 2 °C min−1). Because pure BiVO4 films appear yellow, the red hue of the annealed film is a good indicator that V2O5 is present. Pure Mo-doped BiVO4 films were obtained by dissolving the V2O5 in 1 M KOH for 30 minutes while stirring, leaving the expected yellow color.
Photodeposition of the FeOOH layer on Mo-doped BiVO4 electrodes
A thin layer of FeOOH was photodeposited onto the Mo-doped BiVO4 films in a 0.1 M FeCl2 solution (pH 4.1) while gently stirring. An undivided three-electrode cell with a Mo-doped BiVO4 working electrode, Pt counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (4 M KCl) reference electrode was used. A 300 W Xe arc lamp with an AM 1.5G filter, neutral density filters and a water filter (IR filter) was used as the light source. The entire Mo-doped BiVO4 film (1.6 cm × 1.0 cm) was illuminated through the FTO substrate (back-side illumination) with 4 suns of light intensity, 400 mW cm−2. The photogenerated holes created in BiVO4 are used to oxidize Fe(II) ions to Fe(III) ions, which precipitate as FeOOH on the BiVO4 film.6,26 To facilitate this FeOOH photodeposition, an external bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl (4 M KCl) was applied, creating steeper band bending to aid electron–hole separation and also allowing the photoexcited electrons in the CB of BiVO4 to be transferred and consumed at the counter electrode. The bias applied here was not positive enough to electrochemically oxidize Fe2+ ions and, therefore, the oxidation of Fe2+ ions during this synthesis was achieved exclusively by photogenerated holes in the BiVO4 (i.e., bias-assisted photodeposition). The total charge passed during photodeposition was 50 mC cm−2 over less than 5 minutes (the average current density = 0.2–0.3 mA cm−2). Assuming 100% Faradaic efficiency, the amount of FeOOH deposited on Mo-doped BiVO4 is estimated to be ca. 50 μg cm−2. Since O2 evolution occurs simultaneously during the photodeposition of FeOOH, the value reported here corresponds to the upper limit of FeOOH deposited. After photodeposition, an electrodeposition of FeOOH was carried out in the same 0.1 M FeCl2 solution by applying +1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl (4 M KCl) until the total charge passed was 3 mC cm−2 to ensure better coverage of FeOOH on the Mo-doped BiVO4 surface.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Bruker D8 Advanced Powder Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation to confirm the purity and crystallinity of the Mo-doped BiVO4 electrodes. The morphologies of the samples were examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using a LEO 1530 at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Elemental compositions were determined by PHI 5400 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) using Mg Kα radiation (1253.6 eV) and using an Inductively Coupled Plasma coupled with Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (Perkin Elmer Optima 2000). All spectra in XPS were calibrated to C 1s = 284.6 eV. The samples for ICP-AES analysis were prepared by dissolving the films on FTO in 5% HNO3 solution. UV-vis spectra were recorded using a Cary 5000 UV-vis spectrophotometer, in which the sample electrode was placed at the center of an integrating sphere to measure all light reflected and transmitted. FTO glass was used as the reference for these absorption measurements.
Photoelectrochemical and electrochemical characterization
Photocurrent measurements were performed using simulated solar illumination obtained by passing light from a 300 W Xe arc lamp through neutral density filters, an AM 1.5G filter and a water filter (IR filter), into an optical fiber and calibrating the output to 100 mW cm−2 using both a thermopile detector (International Light) and a NREL certified reference cell (Photo Emission Tech., Inc.). Illumination through the FTO side (back-side illumination) was used unless noted otherwise. All illuminated areas were 0.16 cm2, and all photocurrent experiments were conducted in a 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7, using the same three-electrode setup detailed above. For some measurements, 1 M Na2SO3 was added as a hole scavenger, as noted in the main text. Photocurrents were measured either while sweeping the potential to the positive direction with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 or while applying a constant bias under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). While all measurements were carried out using a Ag/AgCl (4 M KCl) reference electrode, the results in this study are presented against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for ease of comparison with H2 and O2 redox levels and other reports that used electrolytes with different pH conditions. The conversion between potentials vs. Ag/AgCl and vs. RHE is performed using the equation below.E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + EAg/AgCl (reference) + 0.0591 V × pH(EAg/AgCl (reference) = 0.1976 V vs. NHE at 25 °C)
Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) at each wavelength was determined using the following equation, where the number 1240 is the unit conversion factor.  
Radiation from a 300 W Xe arc lamp was passed through an AM 1.5G filter and neutral density filters to approximate the output of the sun. Monochromatic light was produced using an Oriel Cornerstone 130 monochromator with a 10 nm bandpass, and the output was measured using a photodiode detector. IPCE was measured at 0.6 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) with or without 1 M Na2SO3 using the same three-electrode setup described above for photocurrent measurements.
Absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) was obtained by dividing the IPCE by the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) at each wavelength using the following equations.APCE (%) = IPCE (%)/LHELHE = 1 − 10−A(λ) (A(λ): absorbance at wavelength λ)
In order to calculate the maximum photocurrent density (Jmax) that can be achieved by BiVO4 assuming 100% IPCE, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) reference solar spectral irradiance at AM 1.5G (radiation energy (W m−2 nm−1) vs. wavelength (nm))27 was first converted to the solar energy spectrum in terms of the number of photons (s−1 m−2 nm−1) vs. wavelength (nm). Then, the number of photons above the bandgap energy of BiVO4 or Mo-doped BiVO4 (bandgap = 2.4 eV) was calculated using a trapezoidal integration (the increment of wavelength = 5 nm) of the spectrum and was converted to the current density (mA cm−2). In order to calculate the photocurrent density that can be achieved with 100% APCE (Jabs), the LHE at each wavelength was multiplied during each step of the trapezoidal integration.
Capacitances were measured to obtain Mott–Schottky plots for undoped and Mo-doped BiVO4 electrodes using an SP-200 potentiostat/EIS (BioLogic Science Instrument). A sinusoidal modulation of 10 mV was applied at frequencies of 1, 5.5 and 10 kHz. The three-electrode setup was used with a 0.1 M phosphate buffer and 1 M Na2SO3 at pH 7. All electrodes were masked with Teflon tape to expose the same geometric area (0.16 cm2) for this measurement. Although the actual surface areas of the BiVO4 and Mo-doped BiVO4 electrodes were not determined, since they have comparable surface morphologies and, therefore, surface areas, the slopes of the Mott–Schottky plots could be used to compare their relative carrier densities.
Oxygen evolution was measured using an Ocean Optics fluorescence-based oxygen sensor (FOSPOR-R 1/16′′). The airtight electrochemical cell used for this experiment was a custom-built two-compartment cell divided by a frit. One side held a Pt counter electrode, while the other side held the working electrode (i.e., Mo-doped BiVO4/FeOOH) along with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Both sides were filled with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) degassed with nitrogen. The electrolyte in the working compartment was 20 mL, and the headspace volume was 21.5 mL. The needle probe used to make O2 measurements in 10 s intervals throughout the experiment was inserted through a rubber septum and calibrated using 2 points, argon: 0% O2, and air: 20.9% O2, with an error of 5% of the reading. O2 measurements were started with 20 minutes of baseline, followed by 2 hours of back-side illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) while applying 0.6 V vs. RHE. The probe measures the O2 content in the headspace as mole%, which was converted to micromoles after adjusting for the O2 dissolved in solution using Henry's law. The charge passed during the experiment was also converted to μmol by dividing by 4F, where F = 96485 C mol−1, to account for the 4-electron oxidation and multiplying by 106 to convert moles to micromoles.
Results and discussion
Mo-doped BiVO4 was prepared by electrodeposition, allowing for the uniform incorporation of Mo ions to the BiVO4 host lattice. Mo6+ ions were assumed to replace V5+ ions based on their size, charge, and coordination preferences.11,12 The V:Mo molar ratios in the plating solutions and the V:Mo atomic ratios in the resulting Mo-doped BiVO4 films, quantified by both X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), are reported in Table 1. The ICP-AES results were obtained after dissolving the entire Mo-doped BiVO4 films and thus represent bulk compositions accurately while XPS results represent the surface compositions. Therefore, the compositions of the samples referred to in the rest of the text will be based on the results obtained by ICP-AES. Among BiVO4 films doped with various amounts of Mo (samples 2–5), sample 3 containing 3 atomic% of Mo in the V site (BiV0.97Mo0.03O4) showed the most significant enhancement in photocurrent. Therefore, we will mainly discuss the properties of this sample in comparison with the undoped BiVO4 sample.
The SEM images of BiVO4 and BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 electrodes in Fig. 1a and b demonstrate that Mo incorporation does not affect the morphology of the BiVO4 electrodes: the grain size, surface features, and coverage of the two electrodes are very similar. The average film thickness is 450 nm for both samples, which were determined by the side-view SEM images (ESI,† Fig. S1). The respective UV-vis absorption spectra shown in Fig. 1c are also comparable, suggesting that 3 atomic% Mo doping does not noticeably affect the bandgap energy of BiVO4 (ca. 2.4 eV). This result agrees with experimental results and first-principles density-functional theory calculations reported previously.11

XRD patterns of the undoped and Mo-doped BiVO4 samples show that 3 atomic% of Mo incorporation to the V site does not affect the average crystal structure of BiVO4 (ESI,† Fig. S2). However, when the Mo content exceeds 6 atomic%, a noticeable change in XRD pattern was observed, suggesting a structural change from a monoclinic system to a tetragonal system, which is consistent with a previous study.11
The photoelectrochemical performances of BiVO4 and BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 were first compared by measuring photocurrent density–potential (J–V) plot under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 1 M sodium sulfite as a hole acceptor. When the sulfite is present, all photogenerated holes that reach the surface are used for photocurrent generation without being lost to surface recombination due to its fast oxidation kinetics. The fast oxidation kinetics of sulfite oxidation can be confirmed by the absence of transient photocurrent indicative of surface recombination, even when the photocurrent is measured at a potential very near the flatband potential of BiVO4 (see ESI,† Fig. S3). On the other hand, photocurrent loss due to surface recombination is often significant for photooxidation of water when the photoanode surface is not particularly catalytic for water oxidation. Therefore, measuring photocurrent for sulfite oxidation allows accurate assessment of the effect of Mo on the charge-transport properties and electron–hole separation yield is not affected by the poor catalytic nature of BiVO4 or Mo-doped BiVO4 for water oxidation. In addition, comparing sulfite oxidation and water oxidation photocurrents makes it possible to quantify the photocurrent loss due to the poor catalytic nature of BiVO4 or Mo-doped BiVO4 for water oxidation.

Fig. 2a shows that both BiVO4 and BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 serve as photoanodes and generate anodic photocurrents by photooxidizing sulfite using photogenerated holes. While the undoped BiVO4 photoanode already exhibits excellent performance achieving a photocurrent density of 1 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE,6 the Mo doping dramatically enhances the performance and generates photocurrent densities of 1 mA cm−2 and 2 mA cm−2 at a potential as low as 0.28 V and 0.4 V vs. RHE, respectively (scan rate = 10 mV s−1). One of the best photoelectrochemical performances achieved by BiVO4-based photoanodes to date is for the photooxidation of Cl− ions using Mo-doped BiVO4 prepared by metal organic decomposition,12 which achieved 2.0 mA cm−2 at ca. 1 V vs. RHE (scan rate = 30 mV s−1). Our BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 photoanode reduces the potential required to generate a photocurrent density of 2.0 mA cm−2 by 600 mV compared to this system. This comparison shows that the electrodeposition-based methods reported in this study provides one of the most effective ways of incorporating dopants into BiVO4 photoelectrodes with favorable qualities for photocurrent generation (e.g., fewer bulk and surface defect sites, more uniform dopant distribution, sufficient substrate coverage, and optimum film thickness). A more recent study shows that gradient W-doped BiVO4 electrodes prepared by spray pyrolysis coupled with an oxygen evolution catalyst can generate 2.0 mA cm−2 at ca. 0.6 V vs. RHE for water oxidation.23 This result encourages us to investigate electrochemical gradient doping in the future.

Gray line represents dark current (scan rate = 10 mV s−1). (b) IPCE and (c) APCE of BiVO4 (squares) and BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 (triangles) obtained at 0.6 V vs. RHE in the same solution. The error-bars in (a) were obtained by measuring J–V plots of ten different BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 electrodes. 

Fig. 2b shows a comparison of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of BiVO4 and BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 measured at 0.6 V vs. RHE for sulfite oxidation. Using the IPCE data and UV-vis spectra shown in Fig. 1c, absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (APCE) of BiVO4 and BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 were also calculated and are displayed in Fig. 2c. The results show that the APCE is nearly doubled by Mo doping at 400 nm (from 28% to 46%). The effect of Mo doping is even more significant in the longer wavelength region (i.e. 440–510 nm). For example, the APCE at 500 nm was improved from 2.6% to 24.4% by Mo doping.
The maximum photocurrent density (Jmax) that can be achieved by BiVO4 with a bandgap energy of 2.4 eV is calculated to be 7.26 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5G illumination when 100% IPCE above the bandgap energy is assumed. The photocurrent density measured by a photoelectrochemical cell (JPEC) is equal to the Jmax multiplied by the photon absorption yield above the bandgap energy (Φabs), the electron–hole separation yield (Φsep), and the hole injection yield to the desired solution species (Φinj) (eqn (1)).4,28
Using the UV-vis absorption spectrum shown in Fig. 1c, the AM 1.5G solar spectrum,27 and the assumption of 100% APCE, the Jabs of BiVO4 and BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 electrodes were calculated to be 4.79 mA cm−2 and 4.86 mA cm−2, respectively (see Experimental for calculation details). Then, using eqn (2), Φabs = 0.66 and Φabs = 0.67 were obtained for BiVO4 and BiV0.97Mo0.03O4, respectively. JPEC = Jmax × Φabs × Φsep × Φinj(1) Jabs = Jmax × Φabs(2) Jsep = Jmax × Φabs × Φsep = Jabs × Φsep(3)
For the photocurrent generated for sulfite oxidation, which has fast oxidation kinetics, Φinj can be considered to be 1. Thus, JPEC(sulfite) is equal to Jsep. By dividing Jsep by Jabs, Φsep for BiVO4 and BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 were obtained (ESI,† Fig. S4) (eqn (3)). Φsep at 0.6 V vs. RHE for BiVO4 and BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 were 0.23 and 0.57, respectively. These results show that the major effect of Mo doping is the ca. 250% increase in the electron–hole separation efficiency by improving charge transport properties.
An indication of poor electron transport limiting the photocurrent generation of undoped BiVO4 is clearly demonstrated in the comparison of photocurrents obtained by front-side and back-side illumination (Fig. 3). In the case of undoped BiVO4 electrode, the photocurrent by front-side illumination is less than one third of the photocurrent generated by back-side illumination. As explained in the introduction, the fact that back-side illumination generates much higher photocurrent is a good indication that electron transport is a major limiting factor for electron–hole separation in undoped BiVO4.5,7 It should be noted that the observed photocurrent difference is not due to the back-side illumination resulting in more photon absorption. UV-vis absorption spectra measured with front-side and back-side illumination (ESI,† Fig. S5) show that the absorbance measured with back-side illumination is slightly higher. This is because the back surface of BiVO4 is smoother than the front surface, reducing the scattering loss. If the same AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination reaches the front and back surface of BiVO4 by front and back-side illumination, respectively, ca. 4% increase in Jabs for back-side illumination can be expected. However, when the back-side illumination was used for photocurrent measurement, the light intensity was calibrated to be AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) not at the back surface of BiVO4 but at the FTO surface. After the light passes through the FTO, the net intensity of the light reaching the back surface of BiVO4 was measured to be only 85–90 mW cm−2 while the intensity of the light that hits the front surface of BiVO4 when front-side illumination was used was 100 mW cm−2. Therefore, since the reduction in light intensity (15–20%) is more significant than the gain in light absorption when back-side illumination is used, the overall photon absorption should be lower when the back-side illumination is used. Thus, lower photocurrent would be expected by back-side illumination if photon absorption is the main factor causing a difference in photocurrent generation.

Fig. 3b–d shows that as the Mo content in the BiVO4 films increases, both the photocurrents generated by front-side and back-side illumination increase, but the photocurrent generated by front-side illumination increases more substantially. As a result, the difference in photocurrent generated by front-side and back-side illumination decreases as the Mo content increases. For example, the photocurrent generated by front-side illumination becomes almost 80% of that generated by back-side illumination for BiV0.97Mo0.03O4. For BiV0.94Mo0.06O4, the photocurrents created by front-side and back-side illumination become comparable. However, the overall photocurrent generated by BiV0.94Mo0.06O4 is lower than the photocurrent generated by BiV0.97Mo0.03O4. This indicates that the Mo content is optimum in BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 and when Mo content exceeds an optimum amount, other factors resulting from excessive Mo doping (e.g., decrease in depletion width, the presence of Mo-based impurities at the grain boundaries) limits photocurrent generation. It should be noted that the photocurrent generated by front-side illumination shown in Fig. 3c is the highest photocurrent generated by any doped BiVO4 system using front-side illumination to date.2
The effect of Mo doping was further examined by comparing the Mott–Schottky plots of BiVO4 and BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 electrodes. The slopes of the plots obtained at three different frequencies show a slight frequency dependence, but the slope of the Mo-doped sample at each frequency was consistently ca. 1/3 of the slope of the undoped sample, indicating the carrier density of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 is around three times higher than that of the undoped sample. However, the Mott–Schottky plots of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 did not show a corresponding shift of the flatband potential to the negative direction. In fact, the flatband potential of the Mo-doped sample was shifted slightly to the positive direction by ca. 55 mV. It may be due to Mo doping altering the surface charge (e.g., point of zero zeta potential), which affects the position of the flatband potential,29 such that the change in the flatband potential caused by the increase in carrier density is cancelled out. It was reported that metal vanadates such as BiVO4 and FeVO4 can develop vanadium-rich surfaces.30,31 Therefore, in Mo-doped BiVO4 where Mo replaces V, Mo may alter the surface of BiVO4 noticeably although the average Mo content is not significant. The flatband potential of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 being slightly more positive than that of undoped BiVO4 also explains why the photocurrent onset potential of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4, shown in Fig. 2a, is slightly more positive than that of the undoped sample.
The XPS studies in the vanadium 2p3/2 region show that Mo doping increases the amount of V3+ and V4+ species in the BiVO4 lattice (ESI,† Fig. S6). This result confirms that Mo doping provides extra electrons to the system and these extra electrons are localized on V5+ sites, which was predicted by the previous calculations.11 No noticeable changes caused by Mo doping were seen in the Bi3+ XPS spectra.
The J–V characteristics of BiVO4 and BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 for photooxidation of water were measured in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination (Fig. 5, dotted and dashed black lines). The results show that Mo doping improved the photocurrent onset and the magnitude of photocurrent for water oxidation considerably. However, the photocurrent generated by BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 for water oxidation remained significantly lower than the photocurrent generated by BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 for sulfite oxidation (Fig. 5, solid gray line). This is not surprising as the poor catalytic nature of doped and undoped BiVO4 for water oxidation has been reported in previous studies.4–6,12–14,32

To facilitate photooxidation of water, BiVO4 photoanodes have been coupled with various oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs).2 In this study, FeOOH, which on undoped BiVO4 has previously been proven to increase water oxidation photocurrent relative to sulfite oxidation photocurrent, was placed on the Mo-doped BiVO4 using photodeposition.6 The amount of FeOOH deposited on Mo-doped BiVO4 is estimated to be < ca. 50 μg cm−2 based on the current generated during photodeposition. High magnification SEM images of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 before and after FeOOH deposition show that the surface of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH is noticeably rougher due to the presence of FeOOH (Fig. 6). The SEM also shows that, although the amount of FeOOH loading is very small, FeOOH evenly covers the surface of the BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 photoanode, forming a thin conformal coating layer.

The J–V plot of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH for water oxidation is shown as solid black line in Fig. 5. The presence of FeOOH increased the photocurrent substantially, reaching 1.54 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE. The formation of O2 by the BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH electrode was confirmed by measuring O2 during photocurrent measurement. The result shows that the Faradaic efficiency of the photocurrent for O2 generation is ca. 95 ± 5% (ESI,† Fig. S7a). However, the photocurrent of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH for water oxidation remained below the photocurrent of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 achieved for sulfite oxidation (Fig. 5). This may be due to the presence of the FeOOH layer reducing the electron–hole separation yield in the BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 electrode by either changing the band bending or causing recombination at the interface states formed at the BiV0.97Mo0.03O4–FeOOH junction.
In order to examine whether the presence of the FeOOH layer reduces the electron–hole separation yield in the BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 electrode, a simple experiment was performed that compared photocurrents of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 and BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH for sulfite oxidation. Sulfite oxidation should have equally fast kinetics on these two electrodes (Φinj = 1). (When sulfite is present, 100% of photocurrent generated by BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH was used for sulfite oxidation and no O2 was detected, see Fig. S7b in ESI†). Therefore, if the presence of the FeOOH layer does not affect the electron–hole separation yield, the photocurrent for sulfite oxidation with and without the FeOOH layer must be the same.
The J–V curve of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH for sulfite oxidation (Fig. 5, dashed gray line) was determined to lie below that for BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 (Fig. 5, solid gray line), suggesting that the presence of FeOOH reduced the number of holes available for the photooxidation of sulfite. (The Φsep at 0.6 V vs. RHE is reduced from 0.57 to 0.48. See ESI,† Fig. S4.) In order to check whether this change is due to the change in band bending, the Mott–Schottky plots of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH (Fig. 7) were compared with those of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 (Fig. 4b). Since the amount of FeOOH loading is very small and it is conformally coated on the BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 surface, the thickness of the FeOOH layer must be extremely thin. Therefore, it can be reasonably assumed that only the BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 layer contributes to the capacitance measurement.
 Fig. 7  Mott–Schottky plots of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH obtained in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 1 M Na2SO3 (squares: 1 kHz, circles: 5.5 kHz, and triangles: 10 kHz). 

Fig. 7 shows that the flatband potential of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH is shifted to the positive direction by ca. 60 mV compared to that of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 (Fig. 4b), which would result in a decrease in band bending and, therefore, electron–hole separation. As mentioned earlier, both the Fermi level and the surface charge (e.g., point of zero zeta potential) of the photoelectrode affect the position of the flatband potential.29 Because it is not likely that the photodeposition or the presence of FeOOH affects the Fermi level of the BiV0.97Mo0.03O4, and this is confirmed by the unchanged slopes of the Mott–Schottky plots, the observed change in the flatband potential is most likely due to the presence of a thin FeOOH layer altering the surface charge of the BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 photoanode.

Fig. 5 also shows that the J–V curve of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH for sulfite oxidation (dashed gray line) lies still above the J–V curve of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH for water oxidation (solid black line). When the undoped BiVO4 photoanode with a low electron–hole separation yield (Φsep = 0.23) was paired with FeOOH, BiVO4/FeOOH generated photocurrent for water oxidation comparable to the photocurrent for sulfite oxidation (Φinj(water) = 1).6 However, with the higher Φsep achieved by the Mo doping, the FeOOH OEC layer does not seem to utilize 100% of the surface-reaching holes for water oxidation and loses a portion of the surface-reaching holes to surface recombination. The Φinj(water) of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH, calculated by dividing JPEC(water) (1.54 mA cm−2) by JPEC(sulfite) (2.33 mA cm−2) is 0.66 at 0.6 V vs. RHE.
The photostability of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 and BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH for sulfite oxidation and water oxidation, respectively, were examined by measuring J–t plots while applying a constant external bias of 0.6 V and 1.2 V, respectively. Different potentials were used to compare their photostabilities with comparable initial photocurrents. In general, the degree of photocorrosion increases as the magnitude of photocurrent density increases. Therefore, achieving photostability with a smaller photocurrent density would usually be much easier.

Fig. 8 shows that the photocurrent of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 for sulfite oxidation is stable over multiple hours, but the photocurrent of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH for water oxidation shows a gradual decay within one hour. Because undoped BiVO4 coupled with FeOOH, which can consume all holes reaching its surface for water oxidation, is shown to be stable for water oxidation,6,32 and BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 is also stable for sulfite oxidation, it seems that the observed photoinstability of the BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH for water oxidation is caused mainly by the mismatch of supply and consumption of holes at the interface, resulting in the accumulation of holes at the interface, which triggers photocorrosion. Therefore, we believe that the photostability of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 for water oxidation will be gained when BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 is paired with an OEC layer that can exhibit a higher Φinj.

Conclusions
In summary, Mo-doped BiVO4 electrodes were prepared by an electrochemical route that significantly improved the electron–hole separation yield in BiVO4 photoanodes (e.g., from Φsep = 0.23 to Φsep = 0.57 at 0.6 V vs. RHE). As a result, a record high photocurrent, particularly in the low-bias region (≤0.6 V vs. RHE), was achieved for both sulfite and water oxidation. In addition, Mo doping made the photocurrent generated by front-side illumination comparable to the photocurrent generated by back-side illumination. This will be highly advantageous for the construction of tandem cells, composed of BiVO4 and a smaller bandgap photocathode, where front-side illumination of BiVO4 is necessary. The photocurrent of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH for water oxidation was lower than the photocurrent of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 for sulfite oxidation. This is partly because the presence of FeOOH reduces the electron–hole separation yield by affecting the flatband potential of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4 and partly because the hole injection yield of BiV0.97Mo0.03O4/FeOOH for water oxidation is not unity and the FeOOH layer loses a portion of the surface-reaching holes to surface recombination during water oxidation. Combining improved BiVO4 and OECs that can achieve Φinj(water) = 1 while not reducing the electron–hole separation yield in the BiVO4 photoanode will be necessary to further enhance the photoelectrochemical performance of the BiVO4-based photoanodes.
