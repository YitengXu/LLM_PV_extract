    , Accepted 26th April 2016First published on 27th April 2016AbstractThree conjugated D–A terpolymers PBPD1, PBPD2, and PBPD3 with the Pechmann dye-derived electron acceptor and dithienyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole as co-acceptors are presented. Their HOMO/LUMO energies and absorptions can be tuned by varying the ratios of two acceptors. Importantly, HOMO energies of these terpolymers are lowered by increasing the content of the Pechmann dye-derived electron acceptor in the conjugated backbones. The thin blend films of PBPD1, PBPD2, and PBPD3 with PC71BM have been tested as active layers for polymer solar cells. The blend of PBPD1:PC71BM shows a high power conversion efficiency of up to 5.21%, which is higher than that with the blend of the dithienyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole-based polymer without the Pechmann dye-derived electron acceptor and PC71BM. In addition, the neat thin films of PBPD1, PBPD2, and PBPD3 exhibit ambipolar semiconducting properties with hole and electron mobilities up to 0.604 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.225 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Introduction
Solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ)1 polymer solar cells (PSCs) have received considerable attention because of their appealing features including low-cost, light-weight, flexibility and good compatibility with the roll-to-roll process for making large area devices.2 Over the past few years, extensive efforts have been devoted to developing low bandgap polymers consisting of electron donating (D) and electron accepting (A) units by utilizing the electron push–pull concept.3,4 The optical bandgaps, absorption ranges and frontier orbital energy levels have been successfully tuned by varying the electron donors or acceptors.5 Blends of these conjugated D–A polymers with appropriate electron acceptors have led to PSCs with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).6–9
Bandgap, HOMO/LUMO energy and thin film crystallinity are the key metrics of conjugated D–A polymers. Various electron rich- or deficient-conjugated frameworks have been linked and optimized to construct conjugated D–A polymers for high performance PSCs.4,6–9 Recently, conjugated D–A polymers incorporating additional acceptor or donor moieties in the backbones, which are referred to as conjugated donor–acceptor terpolymers, have received increasing attention.10–12 The electron donor–acceptor interactions within the D–A polymers can red-shift the absorptions, but the absorptions in the short wavelength regions, in particular in the visible region, are usually weakened.13 However, the incorporation of appropriate additional electron acceptor or donor moieties may allow us to finely tune and optimize the absorptions. Moreover, by properly choosing co-monomers (D or A) and varying the copolymerization molar ratios, HOMO/LUMO energies and thin film morphologies of conjugated polymers can be finely tuned.10–12 For these reasons, conjugated donor–acceptor terpolymers are of significant interest as electron donors for high performance PSCs.12 For instance, Jo and coworkers reported conjugated random terpolymers entailing diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and isoindigo as co-acceptors; in comparison with the respective DPP-based and isoindigo-based D–A polymers the terpolymers showed strong absorptions and low-lying HOMO levels which led to higher JSC (short-circuit current) and VOC (open-circuit voltage) for the PSCs.12a They further prepared the terpolymer with thiophene-capped DPP and pyridine-capped DPP as co-acceptors, and PSCs with PCE up to 8.11% were fabricated with such a terpolymer.12b
TBPD shown in Scheme 1, as a derivative of the Pechmann dye14 with two capped-thiophenes, has a planar and polar structure with a bis-amide as electron withdrawing units. Being similar to DPP, TBPD can function as an electron acceptor. Some of us investigated both alternating D–A copolymers and small D–A–D molecules with TBPD as the accepting moieties, and both ambipolar and p-type semiconducting behaviors with charge mobilities above 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 were observed.15 TBPD was found to show strong absorptions in the range of 450–750 nm, but its HOMO level (ca. −4.8 eV)14c was relatively high; thus, TBPD is not an appropriate electron acceptor to build D–A polymers as electron donors for PSCs.3 In this paper, we firstly report a new electron acceptor BBPD (Scheme 1) by replacing the two thiophenes in TBPD with two phenyl groups in order to lower the HOMO energy. Then, we describe the preparation and photovoltaic application of three conjugated random D–A terpolymers PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3 (see Scheme 1), which entail BBPD and dithienyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) as co-acceptors with different molar ratios, and thiophene as the electron donor. The results reveal that the HOMO energy levels, absorption ranges and thin film morphologies can be tuned by varying the BBPD/TDPP molar ratios. The thin blend film of PBPD1:PC71BM exhibits better photovoltaic performance with a PCE of up to 5.21% than the respective ones of PBPD2 and PBPD3, and the homopolymer PDPP3T as well.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The syntheses of dibromo-BBPD (2) and the D–A terpolymers PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3 are outlined in Scheme 2. Compound 1, which was synthesized according to the reported procedure,16 was transformed into dibromo-BBPD (2) in 19.9% yield after reactions with 2-octyl-1-dodecylamine and HCl (10%), respectively. The Stille cross-coupling of the dibromo-TDPP, dibromo-BBPD and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene with Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3 as the catalyst yielded PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3 in 87.9%, 84.9% and 86.4% respectively by varying the molar ratios of the dibromo-TDPP vs. dibromo-BBPD. For comparison, PDPP3T without incorporation of BBPD moieties was also prepared (see the ESI†). All the polymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, acetone and chloroform separately, followed by precipitation in methanol again. The chemical structures of the polymers were verified by 1H NMR, and elemental analysis (see the Experimental section and ESI†). On the basis of the elemental analysis results, the molar ratios between the BBPD and TDPP were determined to be 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 for PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3, respectively. All the polymers can be dissolved in CHCl3, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethance, toluene and other aromatic solvents and concentrations of these polymers can reach 10 mg mL−1. The Mw of PBPD1, PBPD2, PBPD3 and PDPP3T was determined to be 44, 33, 41 and 70 kg mol−1 with the PDI of 1.9, 2.2, 2.6 and 2.3, respectively, by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Based on the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data shown in Fig. S1A,† the decomposition temperatures (measured at 5% weight loss) of all polymers are higher than 300 °C. DSC analyses were performed for all the polymers and no obvious thermal transitions were detected (see Fig. S1B†).

HOMO/LUMO energies and absorptions
Fig. S2† shows the cyclic voltammograms of dibromo-BBPD and dibromo-TBPD, and their absorption spectra in solution. For calibration the redox potential of ferrocene (Fc) was measured under the same conditions. The respective onset oxidation and reduction potentials of dibromo-BBPD were presented with reference to the redox potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) (see Table 1). According to previous reports,17 the HOMO and LUMO energies were estimated based on the following equations: LUMO = −(Eonsetred1 + 4.80) eV, HOMO = −(Eonsetox1 + 4.80) eV. In comparison with those dibromo-TBPD (HOMO = −5.25 eV, LUMO = −3.70 eV), the HOMO energy of dibromo-BBPD is lowered to −5.39 eV, while its LUMO level is enhanced (−3.60 eV). Dibromo-BBPD shows absorptions in the range of 400–650 nm with a maximum at 563 nm, which is blue-shifted by comparing with that of dibromo-TBPD (λmax = 615 nm).

In a similar way, the HOMO/LUMO energies of PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3 were estimated and are listed in Table 1. By comparing with those of PDPP3T, the HOMO energies of these D–A terpolymers were lowered, while their LUMO energies increased slightly by increasing the content of BBPD in the backbones (see Fig. 1). For instance, the HOMO/LUMO energies of PBPD3 were estimated to be −5.24 eV and −3.63 eV, respectively. Conjugated D–A polymers with low HOMO levels are expected to increase the VOC of the PSCs.18 But, the bandgaps of PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3 based on the cyclic voltammetric data are larger than that of PDPP3T and increase in the following order: PBPD1 (1.53 eV) < PBPD2 (1.56 eV) < PBPD3 (1.61 eV). Thus, it is necessary to adjust the content of BBPD in the backbone to afford D–A terpolymers with wide absorptions and appropriate HOMO/LUMO levels simultaneously. It is noted that the HOMO levels of these terpolymers are slightly changed when increasing the content of BBPD. This is consistent with the DFT calculations with the following repeated units: thiophene-TDPP-thiophene-TDPP (M1), thiophene-BBPD-thiophene-TDPP (M2), thiophene-BBPD-thiophene-BBPD (M3) in Fig. 2 as discussed below.

 Fig. 2  Calculated molecular orbitals and HOMO/LUMO energies of M1 (A), M2 (B), and M3 (C) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The alkyl chains are replaced with methyl groups for computational simplicity. 
The alteration of HOMO/LUMO levels for PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3 in comparison with PDPP3T is in good agreement with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations (see Fig. 2 and the ESI†). DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G (d) level were performed for the corresponding repeating units. To simplify the calculations, we just took the following repeated units: thiophene-TDPP–thiophene-TDPP (M1), thiophene-BBPD–thiophene-TDPP (M2), and thiophene-BBPD–thiophene-BBPD (M3) for studies, and the branching alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups. HOMO/LUMO energies of M1, M2, M3 were calculated to be −4.58/−2.74 eV, −4.63/−2.71 eV and −4.65/−2.68 eV, respectively. Although discrepancies exist between the calculated HOMO/LUMO energies and those determined based on the respective cyclic voltammetric data, the calculation results also indicate that the incorporation of BBPD lowers the HOMO level and increases the LUMO level. It should be noted that both the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of M1, M2 and M3 are well distributed over their conjugated backbones (see Fig. 2), which are beneficial for charge carrier transporting.19

Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra of the solutions and thin films of all the polymers. Solutions of PBPD1, PBPD2, PBPD3 and PDPP3T exhibit strong absorptions at 722 nm (εmax = 48000 M−1 cm−1), 686 nm (εmax = 33000 M−1 cm−1), 650 nm (εmax = 28000 M−1 cm−1) and 808 nm (εmax = 56000 M−1 cm−1), respectively (Table 1). In comparison, absorptions of thin films of PBPD1, PBPD2, PBPD3 and PDPP3T are red-shifted compared to the respective maxima absorptions of their solutions, which may be owing to the π–π interactions between the conjugated polymer chains according to previous studies.20 It is obvious to note that the absorptions of both solutions and thin films of PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3 are blue-shifted compared to PDPP3T; as the ratio of the BBPD unit increases, the degree of blue-shift increases. As shown in Fig. S3A† and Table 1, the terpolymers show stronger short wavelength absorptions at 390 nm (εmax = 17000 M−1 cm−1) for PBPD1, 380 nm (εmax = 18000 M−1 cm−1) for PBPD2, and 367 nm (εmax = 24000 M−1 cm−1) for PBPD3 than PDPP3T at 400 nm (εmax = 10000 M−1 cm−1). Furthermore, the thin film FWHM (full width at half maximum) values prove that terpolymers (244 nm for PBPD1, 244 nm for PBPD2 and 236 nm for PBPD3) exhibit broader absorptions than PDPP3T (212 nm). All these results show that the absorptions can be broadened by introducing appropriate amounts of BPD into the DPP polymers. PDPP3T exhibits a strong absorption at 808 nm and a shoulder peak at 748 nm in solution, whereas the thin film of PDPP3T shows absorptions at 834 nm and 770 nm. Similarly, the solution of PBPD1 absorbs strongly at 722 nm and two absorptions at 808 nm and 754 nm are detected for its thin film. Thus, the absorptions around 834 nm and 808 nm for thin films of PDPP3T and PBPD1 may be ascribed to the respective interchain interactions. Compared to PDPP3T and PBPD1, the thin film absorptions of PBPD2 and PBPD3 are blue-shifted. As discussed below, the thin film morphologies of PBPD2 and PBPD3 are obviously different from those of PDPP3T and PBPD1, indicating that the interchain interactions for thin films of PBPD2 and PBPD3 are likely different from those of PDPP3T and PBPD1. This may explain the observation that the thin films of PDPP3T and PBPD1 show two absorption peaks in the long wavelength region, while PBPD2 and PBPD3 exhibit one absorption peak in the range of 700–800 nm. On the basis of the respective onset absorptions of their thin films, their optical gaps were estimated to be 1.33 eV for PBPD1, 1.39 eV for PBPD2, 1.41 eV for PBPD3 and 1.31 eV for PDPP3T. The cyclic voltammetric and spectral studies demonstrate that the HOMO/LUMO levels and absorption ranges of these D–A terpolymers can be tuned and broadened by varying the two acceptor (BBPD and TDPP) ratios.

Photovoltaic performance
Thin blend films of PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3 with PC71BM were employed as active layers for fabricating photovoltaic cells with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al (see the Experimental section). For comparison, the photovoltaic cell with the blend of PDPP3T with PC71BM was also fabricated. It should be noted that the PCE of PDPP3T:PC71BM thin blend films is lower than the reported values. This may be due to the low molecular weight and the octyldodecyl side chains. The devices were optimized to maximize the photovoltaic performances by varying the ratios of the donor and acceptor, changing the volume of the additive DIO and selecting appropriate solvents. Table 2 lists the photovoltaic performance data under the respective optimized conditions. Fig. 4 shows the J–V curves of photovoltaic cells with the respective blend films of PBPD1, PBPD2, PBPD3 and PDPP3T with PC71BM as well as the corresponding IPCE spectra under the optimized conditions. But, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the photovoltaic cells with PBPD1:PC71BM, PBPD2:PC71BM, PBPD3:PC71BM and PDPP3T:PC71BM decreased by ∼10%, ∼9%, ∼11% and ∼12%, respectively, after thermal annealing at 80 °C.

The respective blends of PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3 with PC71BM at weight ratios of 1:2 gave the best photovoltaic performances. As listed in Table 2, the open circuit voltages (VOC) of PSCs with PBPD1:PC71BM, PBPD2:PC71BM and PBPD3:PC71BM are higher than that with PDPP3T:PC71BM. This can be explained by considering the fact that HOMO energies of PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3 are lower than that of PDPP3T, and they decrease in the following order: PBPD1 > PBPD2 > PBPD3 (see Table 1). But, JSC and FF are relatively small for PSCs with these thin blend films and as a result PCEs are not significantly high. Among the thin blend films PBPD1:PC71BM yields the highest PCE up to 5.21%. This is in agreement with the IPCE spectra shown in Fig. 4; PBPD1:PC71BM shows much higher IPCE than PBPD2:PC71BM, PBPD3:PC71BM and PDPP3T:PC71BM in the range of 300–900 nm. The fact that PBPD1:PC71BM shows better photovoltaic performance can be attributed to (i) it absorbs more strongly in the range of 500–1000 nm (see Fig. 3); and (ii) it exhibits a better thin film morphology than PBPD2:PC71BM, PBPD3:PC71BM and PDPP3T:PC71BM (see below).
The thin blend films of PBPD1:PC71BM, PBPD2:PC71BM, PBPD3:PC71BM and PDPP3T:PC71BM were characterized with atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). Fig. 5 shows the AFM height and phase images. The surface of PBPD1:PC71BM was found to be more uniform with the root-mean-square roughness (RRMS) of 1.49 nm. In comparison, large RRMSs were observed for PBPD2:PC71BM (2.18 nm), PBPD3:PC71BM (3.67 nm) and PDPP3T:PC71BM (2.47 nm). We also performed the TEM analyses for PBPD1:PC71BM (1:2, w/w), PBPD2:PC71BM (1:2, w/w), PBPD3:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) and PDPP3T:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) thin blend films in order to investigate the phase separations. As shown in Fig. S5,† the light-colored fibril-like structures were detected for blends of PBPD1, PBPD2 and PDPP3T with PC71BM, whereas aggregates of ca. 200 nm were formed within the PBPD3:PC71BM blend thin film. The average widths of nanofibers PBPD2:PC71BM and PDPP3T:PC71BM were measured to be 25 nm and 17 nm, being larger than that (9 nm) for PBPD1:PC71BM. This may explain the reduction of JSC and thus PCE for the photovoltaic cell with PBPD2:PC71BM and PDPP3T:PC71BM. Based on the AFM and TEM results, it may be concluded that PBPD1:PC71BM shows more appropriate phase separation than PBPD2:PC71BM, PBPD3:PC71BM and PDPP3T:PC71BM. In particular, large phase separation occurred within PBPD3:PC71BM.

Fig. 6 depicts the two dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D GIXRD) patterns for these blends. Only one diffraction arc along the qz direction, corresponding to (100) diffraction, at qz = ∼0.34 Å−1 (corresponding to a d-spacing of 18.4 Å), was detected for all the thin blend films. In comparison, a relatively strong (100) diffraction was observed for PBPD1:PC71BM as shown in Fig. 6 and S4.† No diffractions for interchain π–π stacking were detected for all thin blend films. The differences in the surface morphology and packing order degree may explain the observation that PBPD1:PC71BM shows higher IPCE than PDPP3T:PC71BM, although the difference between the absorptions of PBPD1 and PDPP3T is small. To conclude, these AFM images, TEM images and 2D GIXRD data agree well with the observation that PBPD1:PC71BM shows a relatively good photovoltaic performance, while other blends exhibit low power conversion efficiencies.

Thin-film FETs
The semiconducting properties of the neat thin films of PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3 were investigated by fabrication of the bottom-gate/bottom-contact field-effect transistors with conventional techniques (see the Experimental section). The device fabrication and measurements were conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere. On the basis of the corresponding transfer and output characteristics of FETs shown in Fig. S6,† all neat thin films exhibit ambipolar semiconducting behavior. Table 3 lists hole and electron mobilities of PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3 after thermal annealing at 120 °C for half an hour. Among conjugated donor–acceptor terpolymers, PBPD1 exhibits relatively high hole and electron mobilities up to 0.604 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.225 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are comparable to those of PDPP3T. But, both hole and electron mobilities of PBPD2 and PBPD3 with more BBPD moieties in the backbones were found to be about one order of magnitude lower than PBPD1. Fig. S7† shows the AFM images of PBPD1, PBPD2, PBPD3 and PDPP3T after thermal annealing at 120 °C. The thin films of PBPD1 and PDPP3T contain interconnected fibers, and such a thin morphology is beneficial for charge transporting. In comparison, the polymeric chains of PBPD2 and PBPD3 were assembled into large but discontinuous domains. The root-mean-square roughness (RRMS) values of PBPD1 (RRMS = 0.21 nm) and PDPP3T (RRMS = 0.35 nm) are higher than those of thin films of PBPD2 (RRMS = 0.70 nm) and PBPD3 (RRMS = 0.56 nm). Such morphological differences may be responsible for the observation that the thin films of PBPD1 and PDPP3T show higher charge mobilities than those of PBPD2 and PBPD3. Compared to PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3 entail more BBPD moieties in the backbones. Thus, it may be concluded that the random incorporation of BBPD may have a detrimental effect on the inter-chain packing and film morphologies and thus affect the charge mobility.

The reagents and starting materials were commercially available and used without any further purification, if not specified elsewhere. Compound 1 was synthesized according to the previous report.16

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE III 500 MHz and 300 MHz spectrometers. Elemental analysis was performed on a Carlo Erba model 1160 elemental analyzer. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis was performed on a PL-GPC 220 high temperature chromatography system at 150 °C equipped with a IR5 detector; polystyrene was used as the calibration standard and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as an eluent; the flow rate was 1.0 mL min−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out under a dry nitrogen flow; the heating was carried out from room temperature to 550 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetric measurements were carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell using a glassy carbon working electrode, a Pt counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode on a computer-controlled CHI660C instrument at room temperature; the scan rate was 100 mV s−1, and n-Bu4NPF6 (0.1 M) was used as the supporting electrolyte. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a JASCO V-570 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The GIXRD data were obtained at a beamline of BL14B1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained on a Nanoscope V AFM (Digital Instruments) in tapping mode. The thin film surfaces were examined by tapping-mode AFM using a Digital Instruments Nanoscope V atomic force microscope under ambient conditions in the dark.

Compound 1 (500 mg, 1.07 mmol) and 2-octyldodecan-1-amine (1.28 g, 4.28 mmol) were added into 30 mL DMF. The reaction mixture was then heated to 80 °C and stirred for 15 h under N2. After cooling to room temperature, 20 mL of HCl (10%, m/m) was added, and the mixture turned purple immediately. After being stirred for another 10 minutes, the reaction mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 20 mL). The organic layer was washed with saturated NaHCO3, and dried over sodium sulfate. The residue was purified by column chromatography with the mixture of petroleum ether (60–90 °C) and CH2Cl2 (6:1, v/v) as the eluent. Compound 2 was obtained as purple solids (110 mg, 19.9%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ = 7.58 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 4H), 7.37 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 4H), 6.88 (s, 2H), 3.60 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 4H), 1.57–1.05 (m, 66H), 0.90–0.85 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3; 75 MHz) δ: 117.2, 151.8, 132.0, 130.6, 129.0, 129.0, 124.1, 103.6, 44.7, 37.0, 31.9, 31.9, 31.2, 29.8, 29.6, 29.6, 29.5, 29.4, 29.3, 26.1, 22.7, 22.7, 14.1.

Fabrication of organic photovoltaic cells
OPVs were fabricated with ITO as the positive electrode and Al as the negative electrode. The patterned tin oxide (ITO) glass (sheet resistance = 15 Ω−1) was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropyl alcohol and treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Jelight Company, USA) for 30 min. A thin layer (30 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P VP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 150 °C for 15 min. An o-dichlorobenzene solution (10 mg mL−1 of polymer) of the polymers with PC71BM was subsequently spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form the active layer. The thickness (ca. 80–100 nm) of the active layer was measured using an Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. Ca (ca. 20 nm) and aluminium layers (ca. 70 nm) were then evaporated onto the surface of the active layer under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) to form the negative electrode respectively. The active area of the device was 3.08 mm2. The J–V curves were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp coupled with AM1.5 solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp.
Fabrication of OFETs
Bottom-gate/bottom contact OFETs were fabricated. A heavily doped n-type Si wafer and a layer of dry oxidized SiO2 (300 nm, with roughness lower than 0.1 nm and a capacitance of 11 nF cm−2) were used as a gate electrode and gate dielectric layer, respectively. The drain–source (D–S) gold contacts were fabricated by photo-lithography. The substrates were first cleaned by sonication in acetone and water, and immersed in Piranha solution (2:1 mixture of sulfuric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide) for 20 min. This was followed by rinsing with deionized water and isopropyl alcohol several times. Then it was blown dry with nitrogen. Then, the surface was modified with n-octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). After that, the substrates were cleaned with n-hexane, CHCl3 and isopropyl alcohol. The films of the polymers were fabricated by spin-coating their CHCl3 solution (5 mg mL−1) at 2000 rpm. The annealing process was carried out in vacuum for half an hour at 120 °C. Field-effect characteristics of the devices were determined in nitrogen using a Keithley 4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer.
The mobility of the OFETs in the saturation region was derived from the following equation:  where IDS is the drain electrode collected current; L and W are the channel length and width, respectively; μ is the mobility of the device; Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer; VGS is the gate voltage, and Vth is the threshold voltage. The Vth of the device was determined by extrapolating the (IDS,sat)1/2vs. VGS plot to IDS = 0.
Conclusions
In this paper, we report a new electron acceptor BBPD (Scheme 1), a derivative of the Pechmann dye with two phenyl-capped groups. BBPD has been successfully incorporated into the backbone of a DPP-based conjugated polymer to afford three conjugated D–A terpolymers PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3 with different molar ratios of BBPD vs. TDPP (Scheme 1). The results reveal that HOMO levels become gradually lower by increasing the BBPD content in the terpolymers. The absorptions of these terpolymers are blue-shifted in comparison with that of PDPP3T without BBPD, and PBPD1 shows strong and broad absorptions in the range of 500–1000 nm. PBPD1, PBPD2 and PBPD3 exhibit ambipolar semiconducting properties, and among these terpolymers PBPD1 shows the highest hole and electron mobilities up to 0.604 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.225 cm2 V−1 s−1. These have been also examined as electron donors for PSCs after blending with PC71BM. Among the thin blend films of these terpolymers with PC71BM, PBPD1:PC71BM exhibits the best photovoltaic performance with a PCE up to 5.21%, being higher than that with PDPP3T:PC71BM. But, PBPD2:PC71BM and PBPD3:PC71BM show poor photovoltaic performances. Further investigations include the optimization of thin film morphologies and incorporation of BBPD into other conjugated D–A polymers with the aim to improve photovoltaic performances.
