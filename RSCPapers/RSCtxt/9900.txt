, Accepted 24th September 2015First published on 5th October 2015AbstractHerein, a theoretical design addressed to the synthesis of new conjugated co-polymers for organic photovoltaic devices based on tetrazine, benzothiadiazole, dithiophene and thiophene moieties has been applied. This theoretical investigation aims to explore which combination of these molecules could be the most promising for photovoltaic applications, by studying their intrinsic electronic properties. In particular, the simulated values of the band gap energy and the open circuit voltage are the parameters to be taken into account for the selection of potential materials for solar cell devices. The results shows that the most suitable combination, giving rise to low band gaps, higher absorption coefficients and with an interesting offset of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, is the bridge-linked copolymer which alternates the benzodithiophene and the benzothiadiazole moieties, likely because of their push–pull effect.
1. Introduction
The increasing global demand of energy combined, in the medium long term, with the unavoidable reduction of fossil fuel sources1 as well as with the problem of pollution and the correlated risks of climate change, makes the improvement of renewable energy resources a task of increasing importance. With this in mind, one of the most promising technologies is the harvesting of solar energy from sunlight. At first, inorganic systems like silicon were employed as active materials;2 for example, hydrogenated amorphous silicon has been extensively used as a semiconductor in commercial solar cells.3 Since the early 80s, conjugated organic molecules (oligomers or polymers)4 have been used as alternative semiconductor materials. Finally, more recently, hybrid multijunction solar cells5 have been developed in order to match synergistically the physico-chemical properties of inorganic and organic semiconductors.
The advantages of organic semiconductors, compared to conventional inorganic ones, are their low manufacturing cost,6 easy solution processing,7 their potentiality for large-scale devices,8 flexibility and strong absorption coefficients. Moreover, they can be produced in a relative easy way, through organic synthesis reactions, and their electronic properties can be tailored by means of proper molecular design. On the other hand, the drawbacks of organic semiconductors are: intrinsic low charge carrier mobility, relatively high optical band gaps and higher exciton binding energy. The strong binding of the electron–hole pair in these systems implies that the recombination process is more efficient with respect to inorganic semiconductors and that the generation of free charge carriers requires a further driving force to obtain exciton dissociation. This is, usually, carried out through an intermolecular charge transfer between a donor (i.e. a p-type organic semiconductor) and an acceptor (i.e. an n-type organic semiconductor). For this reason the bulk-heterojunction architecture is the most widely used for making organic solar cells9 and remarkable research efforts have been made on the materials and solar cell engineering10 for improving the efficiency of these devices. Generally, based on fullerene systems as n-type organic semiconductors, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have increased their power conversion efficiency from an initial 3–4% to a state-of-the-art efficiency of around 9%,11 the results comparable with the theoretical prediction of a 10% power conversion efficiency for a BHJ made from an ideal p-type conjugated polymer.12 In order to systematically approach this theoretical BHJ solar cell upper limit, it is of fundamental importance to achieve a deeper knowledge of the correlation between morphology and processing with device architecture for solar cell engineering. Moreover, a deeper investigation of the correlation between the electronic structural properties of conjugated systems is necessary in order to achieve an effective tuning of fundamental electronic processes.
In this work we focus our attention on the latter point, by applying a theoretical screening of a potential library of new conjugated oligomers for application in the optoelectronic field. In fact, it is well known that quantum chemical modeling has greatly contributed to the rationalization of the electronic properties of current molecules13–15 and the prediction of unknown ones.16–19 This way, theoretical investigations can be complementary to experimental studies as a source of information on electronic properties. Consequently, this allows savings of time and money by choosing/synthesizing conjugated materials selected as the best candidates to optimize photovoltaic device efficiency. Briefly, we recall the main parameters involved in BHJ solar cell performance and their correlation with the electronic properties of ideal conjugated materials. We explicitly refer to p-type organic semiconductors, since in BHJ solar cells n-type semiconductors are usually fullerene derivatives. The first parameter is the open circuit voltage, Voc, which is correlated with the energy difference20 between the HOMO and LUMO levels of the donor and acceptor components of photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, the actual relative energy position of the HOMO and LUMO levels of the organic semiconductors ensures a downhill energy offset for electron–hole pair (exciton) dissociation as well as allowing an effective charge transfer between the transport layers or the charge carrier injection into the solar cell electrodes. The second parameter is the short-circuit current density, Jsc, which is connected with the charge carrier density and, consequently, indirectly correlated with the light-absorbing efficiency of the active layer.21 This implies that for increasing Jsc, the conjugated systems must have strong absorption coefficients and/or broad absorption spectra with a low threshold of optically allowed electronic transitions, in order to match as well as possible with the solar emission spectrum. Further factors that can affect the short-circuit current density are: the mobility of charge carriers and the efficiency of charge collection on the electrodes.22–24
In order to obtain conjugated molecules with: (1) low band gap, (2) extended absorption spectra which cover the widest possible range of the low solar emission spectrum frequencies and (3) increased efficiency of intermolecular exciton dissociation, the design and synthesis of new materials for organic solar cells have been focused on push–pull architecture.25,26 In this case, an electron-deficient moiety (acceptor, A) oligomer is linked, directly or through a π-bridge, to an electron-rich moiety (donor, D) in a co-polymer/oligomer structure. The literature offers a wide selection of research on the choice of the best D and/or A structures as well as on their relative combinations, aimed to improve solar cell performance. For example, thiophene or thiophene-based heterocycles27,28 and dithienosilole29 have been used as donors, while quinoxaline,30 1,4-diketopyrrolopyrrole,31 thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione32,33 and isoindigo34 have been used as acceptors. Recently, in order to obtain a copolymer/oligomer with significantly reduced bandgap and low-lying HOMO and/or LUMO energy levels, benzothiadiazole35 and tetrazine36 (that have high electron affinity) as acceptors and benzodithiophene37 as a donor, were applied.
For this reason, in order to drive towards the synthesis of new compounds which could be efficient active materials for solar cells, a series of new monomers based on the above molecules and on the thiophene group, as shown in Scheme 1, have been tested by using the potentiality of the theoretical approach. The aim of this work is to investigate the relationship between the molecular structure and electronic properties of these systems. In particular, a quantum chemical investigation using Density Functional Theory (DFT) has been performed, to determine the spectroscopic (optical band gap, absorption spectra) and electronic properties (energy levels of the frontier orbitals) of the studied molecules, and their dependence on the number of repeat units has been calculated and reported. The performance of these structures as a function of the predicted open circuit voltage (with PCBM as n-type organic semiconductors) will also be discussed.

The substituents R and R1 are –C8H17 and –C12H25 alkyl chains, respectively, added to the main chain in order to improve the oligomer solubility. For AY and GY oligomers the structure typology of the repeat unit is modified by varying the number of thiophenyl rings. 
2. Computational method
In this work, quantum chemical calculations have been performed by using the Gaussian 09 program,38 using the density functional theory (DFT) method,39 which has attracted much attention because it can include electronic correlation effects, with relatively low computational cost with respect to other ab initio theoretical approaches. The ground state geometries of the oligomers were fully optimized with the Becke, 3-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr exchange–correlation functional40 (B3LYP) by using the 6-311G(d,p) basis set.
We should remember that the insertion of the side chains is devoted to increasing the solubility and, hence, the processability of these molecules. This implies that, because of the intramolecular interactions established among the alkyl substituents, the electronic properties of the oligomers in solution15 or in the solid state41–44 can be modified with respect to those of the isolated molecules. Nevertheless, in order to reduce the optimization computational cost, alkyl or alkoxy branched chains were replaced by methyl or methyloxy groups, respectively. In fact, it can be demonstrated that the latter ones allow to take into account, with a reasonable approximation, the steric effects, which could be present on the isolated molecule and are strictly correlated with the backbone.45,46 Furthermore, our approximation can describe also the bulk properties of these molecules, since the packing effects generally involve an increment in the backbone planarization and, as a consequence, a corresponding small red-shift of the absorption spectrum.44 A more detailed study of the conformational effects on the electronic properties of the oligomers will be presented in future work. On the basis of the optimized geometries, electronic transitions have been evaluated using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT).47 In particular, since it is well known that the TD-B3LYP method provides a satisfactory agreement with experimental observations, the same functional and basis set employed for the ground state computations was applied. For each molecule, the ten lowest singlet excited states were calculated and on this basis their absorption spectra have been predicted. In fact, the use of ten excited states was found to be, for our system, adequate for exploring the NIR, and vis frequency regions which are of relevance in molecular systems for use in solar cell (where higher frequencies are “cut off” by ITO/glass absorption). The simulation of the open circuit voltage (Voc) was done by assuming that the potential BHJ solar cell is constructed in the following way: the p-type semiconductor corresponds to one of our model oligomers, while the n-type semiconductor is the widely used [6,6]-phenylC61butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). It is known that the HOMO and LUMO orbital energy48 of PCBM are equal to −6.1 and −3.7 eV, respectively.
In general, Voc can be evaluated by splitting the electron and hole quasi-Fermi energy levels induced from the photogenerated charge carriers, according to eqn (1): 
eVoc = (EnF − EpF)
(1)where En/pF is the quasi-Fermi energy level of the n/p-type semiconductors, under sunlight illumination. For example, for Si solar cells (composed by crystalline silicon with a standard doping concentration), EpF and EnF are close to the conduction and valence bands, respectively. Consequently, Voc is approximately equal to the silicon bandgap. Instead, for organic materials the electron/hole quasi-Fermi level correspond, at first order, to the LUMO/HOMO energy level of the acceptor/donor molecule. Two factors affect the energy of the quasi-Fermi levels of the BHJ solar cell: (1) the changes in density of states induced by the disorder in the blend, which raises tail states, and (2) the energy loss induced by charge carrier recombination. These effects result in a lowering of the electron quasi-Fermi level with respect to the acceptor LUMO and an increasing of the hole quasi-Fermi level with respect to the donor HOMO. Hence, ultimately the overall result is a decreasing of Voc. Within this hypothesis, the open circuit voltage can be calculated through the following equation: 
eVoc = (EacceptorLUMO − EdonorHOMO) − Eloss
(2)where, in our case, the acceptor LUMO energy is that of PCBM and the donor HOMO energy is that of the tested oligomer. The Voc loss factor which includes the factor above discussed, denoted as Eloss, was empirically evaluated by Scharber20 to be equal to 0.3 eV, by studying a series of BHJ solar cells composed of the same acceptor and 26 different donor materials. Although this value could represent an overestimation/underestimation of the true loss factor for a new molecule, the Scharber loss factor is generally accepted as a satisfactory approximation.
The short-circuit current density, Jsc can be calculated as:49 
Jsc = q∫Φ(λ)η(λ)ηIQE(λ)dλ
(3)where q is the charge of the carriers, Φ(λ) is the photon flux (i.e. the number of incident photons per unit area), η(λ) is the ratio of photons absorbed (i.e. the light harvesting efficiency, LHE, of the active layer) and ηIQE(λ) is the internal quantum efficiency, at the photon wavelength λ. While, pointing out that the first and last parameters of eqn (3) may be considered independent (at least of first order) on the oligomer nature, Jsc results to be maximized when η(λ) is the highest possible. As a consequence, in this work we focus our analysis on this factor. LHE can be defined,50 according to eqn (4), as: 
η(λ) = 1 − 10−f(λ)
(4)where f(λ) is the oscillator strength at the photon wavelength λ of the absorbing active material (corresponding to the p-type organic semiconductor in BHJ solar cells). Since we are interested in making a comparison between different oligomers, evaluation of η(λ) is restricted to a single representative value.
Finally, the potentialities of the oligomer library depicted in Scheme 1 (to be applied in photovoltaic devices) will be analyzed in the next section as a function of the following parameters: (a) the energy offset of the donor/acceptor frontier orbitals, which are the driving force of the interface exciton dissociation in the free charge carriers, (b) the short-circuit current density, through the behaviour of η(λmax) where λmax is the wavelength of the calculated lowest optical absorption peak and (c) the open circuit voltage, calculated from the difference between the acceptor LUMO and donor HOMO as defined in eqn (2).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometry optimization and frontier orbitals
From the chemical structures reported in Scheme 1, we can see that oligomers B, C and F have a typical, explicit, donor–acceptor structure, while for AY, D, E and GY, ethynyl bridge links and/or 1,4-alkyloxyphenyl moieties are used for tuning the molecular optical and frontier orbital properties. We have chosen to investigate AYn–Dn systems with n = 1, 2 and Y = 1–3, while for En–GYn n = 1–3 and Y = 1, 2 since we expect that these oligomers can be sufficiently representative to describe the trend of the corresponding series. For all oligomers the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) fully optimized geometries are reported in Table S1.† For the AYn systems, there are no significant geometry variations in oligomers at fixed Y and only small bond length changes are found comparing structures with the same number of repeat units n and different Y. In all cases the 1,4-dimethyloxyphenyl moieties act as a spacer between the thiophene segments, which increase from 3 to 5 rings, for Y ranging from 1 to 3. In all cases a dihedral angle of about 50° is predicted between these segments (which are practically coplanar) and the phenyl rings. For the thiophene moiety the formally single and double bonds ranging from 1.420–1.425 Å and 1.372–1.383 Å, respectively, are found. The corresponding C–S bonds range from 1.750–1.759 Å. These results are in good agreement with the X-ray structural data of dodecithiophene51 where formally single, double and C–S bonds range from 1.406–1.423 Å, 1.346–1.376 Å and 1.750–1.759 Å, respectively. This suggests that the geometry relaxation of the oligothiophenes becomes relatively faster with the increasing of repeat units, and about five repeat units are sufficient to get reasonably asymptotic values. The same trend is observed for the energy of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals (see Table 1), despite the corresponding values appearing to be slightly lower. Comparing the results of all AYn type oligomers, it is evident that the main variations are related to the insertion of thiophenyl moieties and, as expected, increasing Y. The HOMO and LUMO energies trends are versus those of regioregular polythiophene (HOMO = −4.96 eV and LUMO = −3.04 eV).52 It is worth remarking that the main variations in frontier orbital energies, and consequently on the energy gap, are relative to the transition from monomer to dimer and by taking in to account that we are mainly interested in a relative comparison. We believe that it is sufficient to refer our investigation to the dimers. Finally, with the aim to point out the nature of the orbital topology, in Fig. 1 the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of A32 are shown. We can see that the HOMO is distributed on the three central oligothiophene segments and on its inside mainly localized on one unit, while the LUMO involves all the three above segments. This suggests that the phenyl moiety better acts as a bridge link in the LUMO conjugation with respect to the HOMO one. The different electron orbital distributions could be used as guideline for a specific design of the electronic properties.16 For Bn oligomers small conjugation effects between the benzothiadiazole and the 1,4-dimethoxphenyl moieties are found as well as between the benzothiadiazole and the ethynyl bridge link. In the monomer, the central rings are coplanar (see Table S1†) and a dihedral angle of about 40° is predicted between the phenyl and benzothiadiazole rings.

 Fig. 1  Sketch of the HOMO (bottom) and LUMO (top) molecular orbitals, with an isosurface of 0.02 e Å−3, of some of the representative oligomers depicted in Scheme 1. 
The dimer, similar to the previous cases, shows a small variation in the geometric parameters, the most significant of which are found for the two directly connected benzothiadiazole rings that have a dihedral angle of about 60°. Globally, from a structural point of view, the dimer could be described as the simple link of two monomers. As a consequence, very little variation in the energy of the frontiers orbitals is found. In Fig. 1, for B2, we can see that the HOMO is delocalized on the oligomer phenyl backbone while the LUMO is on the benzothiadiazole rings. This result underlines the acceptor nature of the latter and the donor properties of the 1,4-dimethoxyphenly moieties. Moreover, it can be easily verified that the HOMO/LUMO in the dimer are practically the superimposition of the corresponding monomer orbitals. The HOMO–LUMO band gaps are appreciably reduced compared to those of the AYn systems. The results obtained for the Cn oligomers are very close to those obtained for Bn. A small interaction between the conjugation path of tetrazine and 1,4-dimethoxyphenyl moieties are predicted but in this case the ethynyl bridge seems to not allow an increase of the electronic delocalization between the different oligomer portions since the triple bond length is predicted to be 1.205 Å (for Bn the optimization gives a value of 1.211 Å), while a dihedral angle of about 30° is predicted between the backbone rings. It is interesting to note two points: the first is the opposite behaviour of the HOMO/LUMO topology of C2 with respect to B2, see Fig. 1. Now the HOMO is mainly localized on the central tetrazine unit, while the LUMO is more delocalized over the backbone, due to the different matching of the two acceptor moieties with the donor 1,4-dimethoxyphenyl unit. The second point is the remarkable low energy of the frontier orbital, which results in a global band gap higher than what might have been foreseen, notwithstanding the push–pull nature of these oligomers. For C2 (see Fig. 1), the HOMO is mainly confined to the centre of the molecule while the LUMO is more delocalized over the backbone. Overall, these results suggest that the Cn oligomers have the potential nature of n-type organic semiconductors. For the Dn oligomers, similar to the AYn case, we have a block structure with two different moieties of donor character, although of different strength. Here, the reference structural unit consisting of benzodithiophene, 1,4-dimethoxyphenyl and benzodithiophene is connected by an ethynyl bridge link. The topological arrangement of the HOMO and LUMO is shown in Fig. 1 and we can see that the triple bond bridge allows a connection between the different sub-units and consequently an appreciable extension of the molecular orbitals over the oligomer backbone. The latter is almost planar with only a dihedral angle of about 20° between the benzodithiophene and the 1,4-dimethoxyphenyl rings and about 0° between two neighbouring benzodithiophenes. The HOMO–LUMO energy difference corresponds to a relatively low band gap energy, see Table 1. Moreover, if the lowest optical allowed transition is mainly due to the HOMO → LUMO excitation, on the basis of the appreciable values of the atomic orbitals (see Fig. 1) we should, qualitatively, expect a non-negligible value of the oscillator strength, compared to previous cases (with the possible exception for the A3n oligomers). It must be remembered that for organic semiconductors, the band gap (defined as the difference between the LUMO and HOMO orbitals energies) is not equal to the optical band gap (Eg,opt, see next section) and the difference, Egap − Eg,opt, is correlated with the binding energy of the electron–hole pair generated by the phonon absorption.
For the last three investigated oligomers En–GYn we have found that a reasonable limit of the asymptotic value of the band gap can be obtained if the calculation of the trimer of the homologous series is included at least. In all previous cases the benzodithiophene unit is directly bonded with another π-system, which is even an acceptor group in one case (Fn). The results obtained for En shows a band gap comparable with those of Dn, the corresponding slightly higher value is due to a lower stabilization of the LUMO (see Table 1). This trend could be correlated to the different moiety alternation; ABAB for En and ABAABA for Dn (where A = benzodithiophenyl and B = 1,4-dimethoxyphenyl moieties), which implies a practically planar structure for Dn, and a helicoidal one for En. The resulting Fn oligomers have a planar geometry and the lowest band gap (see Table 1) between the structures studied here, as can be expected due to the push–pull nature of this oligomer. The LUMO of F3 is somewhat localized on the acceptor group, as clearly evidenced in Fig. 1, implying a intramolecular charge transfer of the HOMO → LUMO excitation. A planar structure is also predicted for the G1n and G2n oligomers and, as shown in Fig. 1, their HOMO and LUMO orbitals are also extended over the backbone as discussed for the Dn case. Consequently, an appreciable oscillator strength value of the lowest optical transition could be expected. Finally, it could be interesting to compare the GYn HOMO/LUMO energy trends with those of the En oligomers. In fact, we can see that the stabilization of the LUMO is more appreciable when the benzodithiophenyl moiety is bonded to the thiophene and that the stabilization increases with the number of thiophene rings. These results suggest that the optimal value of Y should be around 2–3 thiophene units for the AYn and GYn oligomers.
3.2 Optical properties
As previously discussed, the match between the absorption spectrum of the oligomers and the emission spectrum of the Sun, for the reasons previously discussed, is one of the key factors in the application of organic semiconductors in solar cell devices. In this work, the lighting harvesting properties have been modeled using the TD-B3LYP/6-311(d,p) approach. As a representative example, Fig. 2 shows the results obtained for the Fn series, while in Fig. S1† the simulated spectra for all the oligomer models are reported.
 Fig. 2  Plots of the simulated absorption spectra (TD-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)) for the F1–F3 oligomers. 
The absorption spectra were obtained from the convolution of the calculated stick spectra (ten excited states) with a Lorentzian peak shape, and a bandwidth at a half-height of 0.04 eV was applied. From Fig. 2, we can see a red-shift and an increase of the peak intensity for the lowest allowed optical excitation of Fn (n = 1–3) with increasing oligomer size. For F3, the optical gap, corresponding to the lowest allowed optical excitation, lies at 1.775 eV (698.6 nm) which is, as expected, lower than the corresponding band gap, see Table 1. This allows the estimation of the exciton electron–hole pair binding energy which is equal to 0.30 eV, and is a relatively low value for organic systems.53 These results are in nuce, in the previous analysis of the frontier orbitals. In fact, taking into account that this electronic excitation is dominated by the HOMO → LUMO transition (in the CI expansion this monoexcitation has a coefficient of 0.620) and the topological shape of the HOMO and LUMO.
We can note that the most appreciable, but not strong, localization of the LUMO and the more spread distribution of the HOMO over the backbone suggest an electronic excitation with a moderate intramolecular charge transfer character, where the electron and hole center are somewhat delocalized.
This picture corresponds to an electron–hole pair with a low binding energy as found for F3 and in general for Fn (with n = 1–3) systems. On the other hand, since both the frontier molecular orbitals have appreciable atomic orbital coefficients, we could expect that the expectation value of the transition dipole moment and consequently of the corresponding oscillator strength should be appreciable, as found. The predicted value of f (see Table 2) is 1.791 which corresponds to a light harvesting efficiency of 98.4%. These results point out that Fn oligomers with n > 3 can be suitable active materials for application in solar cell devices.

Table 2 summarizes the main results obtained for representative cases of the investigated oligomers, which are: the nature of the electronic transition, the energy of the lowest optical excitation, the corresponding oscillator strength and light harvesting efficiency, the difference between the band gap and the optical band gap.
From the analysis of the data reported in Table 2, it is worth noting the results obtained for C2. In this case the electronic excitation is not dominated by a specific monoexcitation but by a broad manifold one. Moreover, for each of them the nature of the transition is similar to that of the HOMO → LUMO. Despite the push–pull nature of C2, we found opposite results with respect to F3: strong exciton binding energy and low absorption intensity. These findings can be easily understood by looking at the HOMO/LUMO topology which is drastically different compared to the F3 case. In fact, the strong localization of the C2 HOMO implies in the HOMO → LUMO excitation an equivalent strong localization of the electron and hole centers on the backbone. This suggests that a low value of the oscillator strength, an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer, accompanied by an appreciable exciton binding energy should be expected. Thus, the lowering of the excitation energy for the first allowed optical excitation is obtained at the expense of low absorption intensity and higher exciton binding energy. Therefore, we can conclude that for Cn oligomers the appreciable difference between the electronic properties of the acceptor (tetrazine moiety) and those of the donor (1,4-dimethoxyphenyl moiety) lead to the formation of an oligomer, that despite being of push–pull type does not have the necessary features to be applied as a harvesting and p-type organic semiconductor. From Table 2, we can see that the exciton binding energies, approximated to the difference Egap − Eg,opt, are around 0.33–0.38 eV with the exception of the push–pull structures that have the lowest (F3, 0.30 eV) and the higher (C2, 0.90 eV) values.
Moreover, the first allowed optical transition is dominated by the HOMO → LUMO monoexcitation for all cases, except for B2 and C2. This represents further proof that the topological analysis of the frontier molecular orbitals can provide hints on the prediction of the optical properties of conjugated systems, at least qualitatively. With the exception of C2, large values of the oscillator strength are predicted and the light harvesting efficiency is found to be greater than 98%. These results hint that an appreciable short-circuit current density may be achieved. The excitation energies between 485–700 nm reasonably match the emission spectrum of the Sun, especially for higher wavelengths.
Overall, these results clearly indicate that the performance of these oligomers as harvesting materials should have the following order: F3 ≈ G23 > D2 > B2 > A32 ≈ E3 ≫ C2, on the basis of their optical properties.
3.3 Simulation of the open circuit potential and frontier orbital offset
The open circuit potential, Voc, is another keystone parameter to define the performance of a solar cell, and details on how to calculate it are described in Section 2. Here, we quickly remind that we are investigating solar cells with BHJ architecture and with PCBM as an acceptor. In order to underline the influence of oligomer size, Table 3 collects the calculated value of Voc, and the frontier orbital offset at the heterojunction of all investigated oligomers. The latter are the energy difference between the HOMO (LUMO) of the donor and acceptor. These offset values must be sufficiently higher, to ensure the breaking of the bonded electron–hole pair (as the driving force for the intermolecular charge transfer) but not so large to significantly reduce Voc.

The first result highlighted by the analysis of the data reported in Table 3 is that the Cn oligomers are not suitable to be used as p-type organic semiconductors, since their LUMOs are too close to those of PCBM. At the same time the Cn HOMOs are much deeper than the HOMO of the above-mentioned acceptor. This, combined with the corresponding optical properties clearly indicate that the Cn systems are not appropriate as harvesting/donor materials for solar cells. On the contrary, as their charge (electron) transport properties are sufficiently adequate, they could be potential candidates for n-type organic semiconductors.
For all other oligomers, we can see that with increasing repeat units, Voc decreases as a consequence of the HOMO energy increasing. Only for Fn the HOMO energy trend versus the number of repeat units seems to not be sufficiently adequate, since with the increment of the repeat units from 2 to 3, the absolute variation of Voc is still around 0.2 eV. Despite that, the analysis of the band gap reported in Section 1 suggests that n = 3 is sufficient to describe the electronic properties of this system. In order to check this point the F4 oligomer has also been studied, obtaining an energy of −5.20 and −3.19 eV for the HOMO and LUMO, respectively. In absolute values by going from 3 to 4 repeat units, the HOMO/LUMO energy variations correspond to an increase of only 0.03–0.04 eV, so we can consider them reasonably close to the asymptotic ones. The Voc of F4 is predicted to be equal to 1.20 eV. Furthermore, we found that, in this case, the lowest allowed optical transitions lie at 1.70 eV (729.7 nm, i.e. red shifted with respect to n = 3), as expected, with an oscillator strength of 2.664. In all cases the ΔELUMO and ΔEHOMO offsets are more than enough to enhance the intermolecular charge transfer, once again with the exception of Cn. In some cases such as for AYn, it would even be convenient to reduce the ΔEHOMO through an appropriate functionalization of the oligomer backbone.
Overall, on the basis of the predicted open circuit potentials and HOMO/LUMO energy offsets, the order of the most suitable oligomer structure is: B2 > D2 ≈ F3 > G23 > E3 > A32.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have performed a theoretical screening of the electronic and optical properties of a series of oligomer structures, based on the benzodithiophene, benzothiadiazole, thiophene and tetrazine moieties, which are proposed as active materials for solar cell devices. In order to predict their potentiality for photovoltaic purposes, we have taken into account the main factors which describe the efficiency of a solar cell as well as the harvesting materials, which are: the open circuit potential, the offset of the frontier orbitals, the nature of the oligomer absorption spectra and the light harvesting efficiency. On the basis of these parameters, and by taking into account that our modelling could overestimate Voc due to the Eloss approximation, we have found that the oligomer performance should have the following order: Fn > GYn > Dn ≈ Bn > En ≈ AYn. We underline that, as foreseen in the Computational method section, our predicted Voc results are higher than those generally observed experimentally for organic semiconductors. This clearly is due to an underestimation of the Eloss factor in our systems. Notwithstanding, by considering that we are making a comparison between the different structures, our predicted Voc values allow us to make a relative ranking of the present molecules’ performance. The convergence (at least the edge of the asymptotic value) of the electronic and optical properties is practically achieved with n = 2, 3 repeat units within each oligomer series and with Y = 2, 3 (which correspond to an increment of 2–3 thiophene rings in the repeat unit for the GYn and AYn systems). Slight increments of oscillator strength and the red-shift of the lowest allowed optical excitation can be obtained with oligomers of larger dimensions. The Cn series is found not to have the properties of an harvesting p-type organic semiconductor but rather the potential of an n-type organic semiconductor.
The best molecular structure turned out to be that of the bridge-linked copolymer which alternates benzodithiophene and benzothiadiazole moieties. This result is correlated to the push–pull nature of the molecule, where the properties of the isolated donor and acceptor combine favorably to afford an oligomer with a low optical band gap and an appreciable light harvesting efficiency and at the same time the center of the electron and/or hole of the exciton are not found to be strongly localized. This point is confirmed by the molecular structure positioned in second place in the order of potentiality, Gn. In this case the acceptor moiety is replaced by an oligothiophene group which also has a donor nature, despite being of different strength. Nevertheless, the matching of the frontier orbitals between the two groups affords an oligomer with interesting optical properties and a potential appreciable Voc, which could be further optimized by properly tuning the electronic properties of the oligothiophene moiety. Moreover, the analysis of the electronic properties suggests that further improvements could be obtained by using a bridge-linked system such as benzodithiophene–thiophene–benzothidiazole.
Finally, this work confirms once again that the computational approach has the potential for designing and selecting molecular systems with tailored physical–chemical properties, for the improvement of the photovoltaic performance of organic bulk-heterojunction solar cells, as well as the importance of a careful choice of the donor and acceptor nature of the moieties of a push–pull oligomer. The oligomers with higher potential will be synthesized and characterized, and at the same time further improvement of their molecular design will be carried out.
