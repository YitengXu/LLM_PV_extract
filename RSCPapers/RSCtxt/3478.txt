Profiting from this UQ10 based electrolyte a 10% increased power conversion efficiency of 8.18% is achieved compared with the traditional one containing I2 (7.44%). The superior performance of this UQ10 based electrolyte is mainly derived from the lower visible light wastage and high catalytic activity to the counter electrode as revealed by photoelectrochemical characterization. Moreover, being widely adopted in cardiovascular medicine and cosmetics, UQ10 is a very safe and low-cost choice for DSSCs. With the advantages of high power conversion efficiency, bio-safety, universal dye compatibility and diversity of molecular design, UQ10 is very promising to be widely applied in DSSCs, and perovskite based solar cells.
As energy shortage is gradually becoming a severe crisis, various solar cells have been intensively investigated.1–8 By contrast, the most original and efficient light power conversion device is the chloroplast which converts captured light to electrons (or ions) through photosystem I (PS I) and photosystem II (PS II) and then turns this kind of electric energy into storable chemical energy.9,10 Based on a very similar mechanism of photosynthesis, O'Regan and Grätzel reported a prototype of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) in 1991 (ref. 2) which has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 12.3% (ref. 11) in the last two decades. The process of photosystem II in photosynthesis which the DSSC was inspired by can be simply described as such: (1) the chlorophyll (as the dye in a DSSC) on a thylakoid membrane (nanostructured photoanode) is in a high energy state (or excited state) after capturing light; (2) the excited chlorophyll loses the energy (loss of electron) which is used to decompose the water; (3) the chlorophyll is regenerated by reacting with Q (redox couple) and the Q turns to be H2Q; (4) the H2Q obtains an electron from cytb6f (the counter electrode).
Playing a significant part in regenerating the photo-oxidized dye and facilitating charge transport12 in DSSCs, electrolytes (liquid or solid) have been researched in abundance, and several good results have been obtained.13–30 However, cobalt-complex based electrolytes, by which the highest energy conversion efficiency was achieved11 and most other organic redox couples are restricted in further industrial application since they are only compatible with circumscribed sensitizers.31 Referring to the traditional electrolyte based on iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) which performs well with the most widely-used Ru-complex dyes and most other sensitizers, it also possesses the drawbacks of considerable visible light absorption, corrosion to counter electrode and high sublimability of I2.32,33 In view of these, superior alternative electrolytes are urgently desired.
Inspired by the PS II system of photosynthesis illustrated in Scheme 1, plastoquinone (PQ) (Scheme 2c), which plays a very similar role with redox couples in PS II is very appealing to us as a promising alternative in DSSCs. Before this, Cheng et al. had reported preliminary research on an electrolyte based on benzoquinone34 (Scheme 2a) which is the simplest molecular structure of quinones. However, the reported redox couple is unstable and unable to be prepared in an open environment.35 Aiming to overcome this drawback, we had developed a more facile and stable method to prepare a benzoquinone based electrolyte in an open environment via acetic acid treatment in a previously reported work.36 A slightly lower power conversion efficiency of 5.82% compared with the traditional electrolyte was obtained which suggests that quinones have great potential to be applied in DSSCs. What's more, several kinds of simple derivatives of benzoquinone (Scheme 2b) were studied in the same work trying to find out the optimal quinone for use in DSSCs. Based on these, natural quinones such as PQ and ubiquinone 10 (UQ10) presented in Scheme 2d have recently drawn our attention, inspired by PS II. As the PQ is not easy to obtain, a very similar quinone of UQ10 has been employed as electrolyte A in a DSSC compared with the common one based on I2 (electrolyte B) in this paper. Herein, we assembled DSSCs employing electrolyte A and electrolyte B, and measured their performance. A high power conversion efficiency of 8.18% has been achieved by electrolyte A which is 10% higher than electrolyte B (7.44%) and about a 40% increase in contrast to the previously studied benzoquinone. As a frequently-used component in cardiovascular medicine and cosmetics,37,38 UQ10 has high bio-safety to humans. Apart from this merit, other advantages such as high power conversion efficiency, universal dye compatibility and diversity of molecular design of UQ10 contribute to its promising applications in DSSCs and perovskite based solar cells.4,5

UQ10 is an unctuous and plastoquinone-like component of the electron transport chain, therefore a liposoluble solvent, ethyl acetate, was used to prepare the UQ10 based electrolyte. The main redox process of UQ10 (Scheme 2d) is a two step reaction which is the same with benzoquinone (Scheme 2a).36,39,40 Though the exact redox process in the electrolyte A system can not be determined in our current work, the relative redox potential of electrolyte A compared with electrolyte B is able to be derived from the confirmed value reported previously.39 Reported by Damien Marchal et al.,39 the standard redox potential of UQ10 is about 0.105 V vs. NHE at PH7 which is more negative than I−/I3− (0.45V vs. NHE).41 The relatively negative redox potential tends to lead to a low open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the DSSC using a UQ10 based electrolyte. To optimize the composition of the electrolyte containing UQ10, a series of electrolytes with different concentrations of UQ10 ranging from 0 to 0.1 M were prepared and applied in DSSCs (experimental details are listed in the ESI†). The results shown in Fig. 1a exhibit that the conversion efficiencies of the DSSCs firstly rise and then descend with increasing concentration of UQ10. This suggests that the mixing of UQ10 leads to an enhancement of the performance of I2-free electrolyte in devices and the optimal amount of UQ10 is 0.01 M. The decline of the power conversion efficiency when the amount of UQ10 increases further may be ascribed to the precipitation of UQ10 in the solvent at high concentration. Most noteworthy is that the introduction of moderate UQ10 contributes significantly to the performance of the DSSCs.

When comparing the UQ10 based electrolyte (electrolyte A) with the traditional one containing I2 (electrolyte B) electrode B was employed under the same conditions (one sun illumination) to assemble the DSSCs. The results displayed in Fig. 1b indicate that the short-circuit current density (JSC) of DSSC based on electrolyte A increases from 15.5 to 18.9 mA cm−2 with a similar VOC and fill factor (FF) to those of electrolyte B (detailed data are listed in Table 1). The power conversion efficiency reaches 8.18% from 7.44% with a 10% increase which is a significant result to explore alternatives to the frequently-used electrolytes. Through analysing the properties of UQ10, this enhanced performance of DSSC using electrolyte A could be attributed to its high ion mobility, faster reaction rate and function of electron transfer ladder between the dye and iodide ions.

In order to investigate the visible light absorption of electrolyte A and electrolyte B, UV-vis spectra were measured as shown in Fig. 2a. It can be clearly seen in the photograph inset in Fig. 2a that the frequently-used electrolyte B is a dark mulberry colour while the electrolyte A is transparent yellow. By quantitative analysis, electrolyte B has a strong absorption below 500 nm in contrast to electrolyte A which means the latter almost does not contend with dyes for incident light and thus contributes to the valid utilized light. And as we know, more valid light utilizing will naturally result in higher JSC which is in conformity with the results in Fig. 1b and Table 1.

The symbols are the experimental data, and solid lines are the fitted results. 
Open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements were employed to explore the electron lifetime of DSSCs with electrolyte A and electrolyte B. After turning off the illumination in a steady state, the VOC will subsequently decay and the decay curves are presented in Fig. 2b. The electron lifetime (τn) is a function of the decay rate of VOC which is described as the following equation:42  where kBT is the thermal energy, and e is the electron charge. Fig. 2c shows the electron lifetime (in log-linear representation) for the DSSCs using electrolyte A and electrolyte B. It is obvious that the VOC decay rate of electrolyte A is slower and its electron lifetime is longer than that of electrolyte B which demonstrates that excited electrons in devices employing electrolyte A transport longer, and more electrons enter the external circuit. So taken as a whole, higher device performance is achieved which profits from the longer electron lifetime of electrolyte A.
Attempting to clarify the charge transfer process in devices employing electrolyte A and electrolyte B, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was investigated under one sun illumination under open circuit conditions. By fitting the experimental data with an equivalent circuit model presented as the inset in Fig. 2d, the internal impedance can be determined including series resistance (RS), charge recombination resistance (RTiO2) and charge transfer resistance (RCT) at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (detailed data are shown in Table 2). As generally known, RCT is the most direct and valuable information when discussing the influence on DSSCs from the electrolytes. A much smaller first-semicircle in the high frequency region and about one third RCT (1.98 Ω) of the electrolyte A-based device compared with electrolyte B (RCT = 5.9 Ω) powerfully demonstrate that the catalytic activity of UQ10 on platinum is much more superior than I2 which is coincided to the 10% increased JSC of the electrolyte A-employed device presented in Fig. 1b. RS read from the onset of the first semicircle in Fig. 2d represents the ohmic series resistance of DSSCs, which is correlated with the fill factor of the devices. The RS (15.2 Ω) of electrolyte A is a little bit higher than electrolyte B (14.6 Ω) which corresponds to the slightly lower FF of electrolyte A. With a larger second semicircle in the low frequency region compared with electrolyte B, the electrolyte A-based DSSC is deduced to have a lower RTiO2 (16.9 Ω) which contributes to its slightly lower VOC (693 mV). In conclusion, the J–V properties can be explained adequately by this electrical impedance analysis. On the other hand, the electron lifetime can be estimated from the frequency of minimum Z′′ (ωmin) in the low frequency semicircle by the following equation:43

a Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed with the frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz under open circuit conditions under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. The compositions of the electrolytes are the same as in Table 1.

As revealed in Table 2, the calculated value of the electron lifetime of the device based on electrolyte A (42.5 ms) is longer than electrolyte B (35.2 ms) which is in good agreement with the results measured by OCVD shown in Fig. 2b and c. Typically, a longer electron lifetime corresponds to a higher VOC in DSSCs. However, the result is abnormal for electrolyte A which has longer electron lifetime but a slightly lower VOC compared with electrolyte B. This discrepancy can be ascribed to the complex multi-step redox behavior of UQ10 which may retard the electron transport processes, so the electron relaxation of each reaction step lengthens the whole electron relaxation time which leads to a high measured electron lifetime without the recombination decreasing.
In summary, a bioinspired I2-free electrolyte based on UQ10 has been investigated in this work. A high power conversion efficiency of 8.18% was achieved by the UQ10 based electrolyte which is a 10% increase compared with the traditional one and about 40% enhanced compared to the previously mentioned benzoquinone.34 Several characterization methods have been applied to expound its superior performance, and less incident light wastage and high catalytic activity to the counter electrode are considered to be the main factors determining the results. With advantages of high power conversion efficiency, bio-safety, universal dye compatibility and diversity of molecular design, UQ10 is very promising to be an alternative to traditional I2 based electrolytes and even widely applied in perovskite based solar cells. However, there are still several challenges such as long-term stability, solvent selection and pH value adjusting which require further exploration.
