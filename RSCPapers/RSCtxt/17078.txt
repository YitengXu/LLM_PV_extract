    , Accepted 2nd September 2020First published on 2nd September 2020AbstractOrganic core/shell micro/nanostructures (OCSSs) not only demonstrate outstanding physicochemical features, but also provide an expanded heterojunction area to enhance their thermal stability and charge-carrier mobility, which are beneficial to high-performance optoelectronic applications. However, the fine synthesis of OCSSs is still a considerable challenge because of the difficulty in realizing the perfect lattice matching and surface-interface energy balance. Hence, it is suggested that the growth mechanism and corresponding optoelectronic devices are imminently investigated and developed. A summary of recent advances in the preparation and the optoelectronic application of OCSSs are necessary for readers to get a more comprehensive understanding on their rational design and controllable construction to achieve superior performance devices. Herein, recent breakthroughs in OCSSs are introduced, including the organic molecular design, preparation methods, and optoelectronic applications.

1. Introduction
Heterostructures made from several material compositions have generated immense scientific interests due to their novel physicochemical properties at junctions, including rectifying behavior,1 photovoltaic effect,2 energy transfer,3 exciton–plasmon coupling,4,5 and photon–plasmon coupling.6 These outstanding characteristics, which are not inherent properties of their corresponding individual components, can be achieved through rationally designing each component and fine synthesizing the nano-architectonics. Furthermore, the organic heterostructures with multiblock,7–10 network,11 branch-like,12–15 core/shell,16–19 and lateral20 structures have become a shining star as building blocks for the optoelectronic applications, not only due to the significant advantages of low-cost solution processability, light weight, mechanical flexibility, and tailor-made molecular structure, but also due to the novel physicochemical properties of the heterostructure. As a result, these organic heterostructures have been widely developed in optoelectronic devices, such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),17,20 organic photodetectors,21,22 optical routers,12,13 optical logic gates,14,23,24 and photonic transistors.10,25 In particular, the organic core/shell micro/nanostructures (OCSSs) have attracted increasing research interest in both fundamental studies and potential applications, owing to their specific characteristics: (1) versatility, stability, tunability, biocompatibility and dispersibility obtained with the help of the coated shell;26,27 (2) expanded heterojunction area and decreased excited carrier transport lengths.16,17 The OCSSs provide an important platform for developing high-performance optoelectronic devices, unveiling the structure–property or charge transfer–property relationships.
Over the past decade, a series of OCSSs have been successfully constructed for optoelectronic applications based on polymer/polymer, polymer/small-molecule or small-molecule/small-molecule material pairs. These investigations suggest that the controlled self-assembly of the OCSSs on morphology and structural composition plays an important role to determine their optoelectronic features, as well as their potential applications.28–30 Accordingly, for a specific optoelectronic function, it is necessary to significantly advance this research direction to controllably design and synthesize desired OCSSs. Although advanced modern lithography technology has been widely utilized to construct various nanostructures, the self-assembly method is the indispensable choice for the formation of the core/shell structures with a non-thermodynamic equilibrium state.31,32 Nevertheless, a systematic summarization and analysis are needed but lacking in fact, which would be helpful for the readers to understand this potential field and guide the development of novel optoelectronic applications. Herein, we introduce recent advances focused on fine fabrications and optoelectronic applications of OCSSs towards diverse optoelectronic performance for integrated applications. Component designs and fabrication strategies, as well as their optoelectronic application are emphasized here, involving the design of core or shell composition, topological control of composition/geometry, and relationships between structure and optoelectronic properties.
2. Designed preparations of organic core/shell structure
The inorganic or metal core/shell structures have been developing for several decades, and have also realized great accomplishment in both fundamental research and applications.26,27 The pioneer work involved core/multishell CdS-based quantum dots with nearly 100% photoluminescent quantum yield, which were applied to construct high-performance quantum dot light-emitting diodes.33 As shown in Fig. 1a, the core/shell micro/nanostructures can be classified into zero-dimension (0D) particles, core/monoshell, core/doubleshell, core/tribleshell and other core/mutilshell structures from the shell layer-number. Compared with the inorganic or metal systems, OCSSs were just developed in the last two decades. Core/monoshell microspheres or microrods were achieved via stepwise seeded growth method and sequential self-assembly (Table 1 and Fig. 1b), which is based on perfect lattice matching or surface-interface energy balance (Fig. 1c). Moreover, most OCSSs were polymer microspheres earlier, as well as the 1D OCSSs based on small molecules reported in last several years fabricated via the self-assembly process. Solution or vapor-phase self-assembly, microemulsion, electrospinning and inkjet printing are the main prepared methods for OCSSs.

2.1. Polymer core/shell structure: solution process
Core/shell structure nanoparticles have generated immense scientific interest in their prospective applications of catalysis,34 energy storage,35,36 biomedicine,37 and optics,33,38,39 owing to the various unique advantages of versatility,2,40 tunability,27,31 stability,41 dispersibility,42 and biocompatibility.43 Zhang and co-workers demonstrated a decently designed core/multishell structure to overcome the spectral overlap and background interference for advanced biological assays.44 Inspired by the characteristic advantages of the organic materials, the OCSSs have been regarded as promising platforms for developing an organic self-assembly and high-performance optoelectrical application. Conducting polymers have drawn considerable research attention in the last several decades because of the excellent contribution of their unique π-conjugated system for the remarkable chemical and physical characteristics.45,46 In particular, polypyrrole (PPy) with five-membered heterocyclic rings displays outstanding electric conductivity, redox properties, environmental stability, and large-scale synthesis accessibility via electrochemical and chemical processes.47 It is viable and significant to enhance the catalytic activity, luminescence, and dielectric properties of PPy via the core/shell structure. Oh and co-workers demonstrated a facile fabrication of photochromic PPy/pyrene core/shell nanoparticles via a controlled microemulsion synthesis based on the equilibrium thermodynamics.48 As shown in Fig. 2a, the pyrene and pyrrole monomer mixture was added dropwise to a surfactant solution. Then, the more hydrophobic pyrene molecules were favored to be transported into the hydrophobic interior of the micelle. Furthermore, the polymerization of the pyrrole monomer induced a phase-separation between the pyrene molecules and polymer, leading to the construction of the core/shell structure after removing the surfactant. It is similar to the formation of poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA)/polystyrene (PS) and PS/poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone) composite particles.49,50 The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2b) of the crystalline structure of pyrene illustrates the formation of the pyrene/PPy core/shell structure. The enhanced amount of hydrophobicity in pyrene leads to the facilitated phase-separation. Therefore, the shell thickness can be tuned by manipulating the amount of the hydrophobicity in pyrene. Poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK), with its characteristic optical and electronic properties, has also elicited considerable interest as hole transport layers in the optoelectronic application. Nevertheless, its poor electric conductivity restricts its application for the high-performance optoelectronic devices.

In order to modify its electric conductivity, Yoon and co-workers demonstrated the development of PPy/PVK core/shell nanoparticles via nanoparticle-seeded dispersion polymerization.51 First, microemulsion synthesis was applied to prepare the monodisperse PPy nanoparticles via chemical-oxidation polymerization process in an oil/water emulsion with dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB, acting as the surfactant). After modification by ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN), PPy nanoseeds with α,α′-linked or α,β-linked pyrrole rings can provide the initiation sites for the growth of the PVK branches (Fig. 2c). The formation of the PPy/PVK core/shell nanoparticles was verified by their increased diameter compared with the pure PPy nanoparticles. The N-vinylcarbazole monomer concentration plays a key role in controlling the PVK shell thickness. The PS particles can be readily prepared with narrow particle size distributions and its non-film-forming nature, which was chosen as a latex substrate to construct the core/shell structure after coating sterically stabilized latex particles with an ultrathin PPy overlayer.49,52 Notably, the microemulsion synthesis is a universal synthesis approach for the core/shell nanostructures from both polymers and small organic molecules. Constructing iridium(III) bis(2-phenylbenzothiozolato-N,C2′) acetylacetonate ((BT)2Ir(acac))/perylene core/shell structures with the excellent upconverted emission feature is a typical case.53 (BT)2Ir(acac) nanoparticles with an average diameter of ∼30 nm were prepared via microemulsion micelles. The perylene shell was controllably prepared after reducing perylene perchlorate by the H2O outside the (BT)2Ir(acac) particles. The shell thickness can be finely controlled by adjusting the amount of perylene perchlorate. The obvious contrast between the core and shell layers in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 2d) and the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurements suggested the formation of the well-defined (BT)2Ir(acac)/perylene core/shell nanoparticles.
An elaborate nanoscopic energy converter composed of molecularly conjugated domains is desired for the high-effect conversion of light energy into electric energy in organic photovoltaic devices.54 Nevertheless, the donor and acceptor molecules tend to form orderly stacks on each other via the charge-transfer (CT) assembly process, leading to a quickly trapped and readily annihilated process for the photochemically generated charge carriers with a rapid recombination.55 It was discovered that hexabenzocoronene (HBC) derivatives with symmetrically substituted paraffinic side chains can self-assemble into the well-defined nanotubular structure with a high hole-transport capability. Furthermore, the hydrophilic triethylene glycol (TEG) chains coat their inner/outer surfaces walls (Fig. 2e).56,57 Aida and co-workers demonstrated a controlled self-assembly of the trinitrofluorenone (TNF)-appended HBC amphiphilic coaxial core/shell nanotubes (Fig. 2f) during methanol (MeOH) vapor diffusion into a THF solution.32 Owing to the expanded heterojunction area with a remarkable bi-continuity between the core and shell semiconductors, the core/shell structures demonstrated interesting photovoltaic and rectifying properties.16 Furthermore, the organic coaxial core/shell nanocables consisting of a self-assembled nanowire core with an outer polymer shell (Fig. 2g) were controllably prepared via a simple one-step solution process. The 1-cyano-trans-1,2-bis-(30,50-bis-trifluoromethyl-biphenyl)ethylene (CN-TFMBE) nanowires with a bulk electric conductivity and a high fluorescence were employed for the core part. The binary mixtures of CN-TFMBE and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) self-assemble into the coaxial nanocables via spin-coating process. The corresponding TEM image (Fig. 2g) indicates that the P3HT polymer wrap around the CN-TFMBE nanowires into the core/shell structure.
Light-emitting conjugated polymers have attracted intense attention in their promising application in flexible optoelectronic devices.58 Due to the active exciton behavior and the high-energy absorption, the wide-bandgap blue light-emitting conjugated polymers suffer from complicated photophysical behavior, including the energy transfer, the large Stokes shift, and the aggregation-induced excimer emission, leading to disillusionary color purity, luminous efficiency and stability.59 Taking advantaging of the supramolecular steric hindrance effect and packing mode effect, Huang and co-workers developed a universal strategy to realize the complementary core/shell structure for robust ultrastable light-emitting conjugated polymers (Fig. 2h).60 The π-stacking side chain aromatic groups self-assemble into a sheath and clad the core of the chain backbone, which enables interchain charge transport and simultaneously hinders the solidification process of the interchain π–π interaction.
2.2. Organic small molecular core/shell structure: solution process
Fast response and high sensitivity in gas sensing of the waveguiding single-nanowire present an enticing prospect for the miniaturized sensors.61–65 Moreover, the multifunctional heterostructures provide a valuable guidance to further achieve the highly efficient gas-sensing properties.66 Prof. Yao and co-workers controllably synthesized a single-crystalline 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl) anthracene (BPEA)/bis(2,4,5-trichloro-6-carbopentoxy-phenyl) oxalate (CPPO) core/shell nanowire for highly efficient H2O2-sensing.22 The epitaxial growth in such a core/shell structure is dependent on the good compatibility between the BPEA and CPPO molecules. It has been verified that both BPEA and CPPO molecules have good solubility in acetone, while the BPEA molecule has poor solubility in ethanol.15,67 After the fast evaporation of acetone, the strong intermolecular π–π interaction drives the self-assembly of the BPEA nanowires. Then, the CPPO molecules gradually aggregate onto the surfaces of the BPEA nanowires to form the shell. The BPEA/CPPO core/shell nanowires display a bright green emission on the surface, and yellow emission on the center part (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the pure BPEA nanowires only display yellow emission.68 The identifiable contrast between the surface and the center part in the TEM image (Fig. 3b) further verifies the formation of the core/shell structure. Prof. Yao and co-workers also finely prepared the 1,5-diphenyl-3-(naphthalene-4-yl)-1H-pyrazoline (DPNP)/2,5-bis(2-(N-hexadecylpyridinium-4-yl)-vinyl)pyrrole iodide (Dye 1) core/shell nanostructure via two-step seeded growth method.69 In such process, the reprecipitation method was employed to prepare the DPNP seed nanorods via strong intermolecular π–π interactions.70–72 The shell was obtained after the epitaxial growth of Dye 1 on the surface of the seed nanorods by quickly injecting Dye 1 solution into the DPNP seed nanorod dispersed system. The TEM image (Fig. 3c) and the EDX spectroscopy (Fig. 3d) line across the section clearly clarifies a core/shell structure with a shell layer of about 5–10 nm thickness. All of the above results indicate that the DPNP/Dye 1 core/shell structures have been successfully realized. Based on advanced research studies in the controlled self-assembly of the organic cocrystal micro/nanostructure, such as the halogen-bonded 4,4′-((1E,1′E)-(2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-phenylene) bis(ethene-2,1-diyl)) dipyridine (DPEpe)-1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene (F4DIB) microplates and nanowires73–75 and hydrogen-bonded DPEpe-4-bromo-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzoic acid(BrFTA) nanowires, Prof. Liao and co-workers proposed a hierarchical self-assembly strategy to controllably prepare the organic core/shell heterostructure through tuning the intermolecular interaction.19 Due to the intermolecular interaction intensity of |Ehydrogen bond = −15.66 kcal mol−1| > |Ehalogen bond = −4.90 kcal mol−1| > |Eπ–π interaction = −0.09 kcal mol−1|, the hydrogen-bonded DPEpe-BrFTA cocrystal naonwires first self-assemble and act as seeds. Then, the halogen-bonded DPEpe-F4DIB cocrystals undergo epitaxial growth horizontally on the surface of the DPEpe-BrFTA nanowires, leading to the organic core/shell heterostructure (Fig. 3e). The surface-interface energy balance plays an important role for such a horizontally-epitaxial growth, similar as in the case of the β-TiO2–FexOy nanorods76 and the anthracene-1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene (TCNB)/naphthalene-TCNB organic microdumbbells.77 The fluorescence microscopy (FM) images (Fig. 3f, g) suggest the formation of the well-defined dumbbell-like and whole core/shell nanowires, which were controllably prepared by adjusting the formation ratio of the hydrogen-bonded DPEpe-BrFTA cocrystal and the halogen-bonded DPEpe-F4DIB cocrystal. The bright yellow-emitting shell with a red-emitting wire in the core indicates the formation of a core/shell structure. Remarkably, these DPEpe-based organic core/shell heterostructures prepared for 90 days demonstrated the same morphology and optical property as the fresh samples, which confirmed their high stability. More recently, the luminescent dibenzothiophene/fluorene/carbazole-TCNB CT cocrystals with perfect lattice matching have been applied to achieve organic core/shell microrods. Notably, the infrequent multishell structures were preliminarily obtained through a stepwise seeded-growth method.78 Furthermore, Prof. Fu and coworkers developed a two-step solution crystallization strategy to rationally construct a library of X-TCNB/Y-TCNB (X = naphthalene; dibenzothiophene fluorene, anthracene and phenanthrene; Y = 8-methylquinoline, pyrene, carbazole and benzoperylene) core/shell microrods.79 The cocrystal engineering provides an efficient and versatile strategy to construct building blocks with desired compatible structures for core/shell structures, and affords new insight into designing and constructing more sophisticated organic heterostructures, especially OCSSs.

The co-precipitation method is not the only approach to prepare the OCSSs. Zhang and co-workers developed a convenient additive-adsorption method to prepare organic core/shell microrods.79 Due to the π–π interaction and chloride ion-mediated hydrogen bonding along the two directions, the dimethyl melamine (Mela-DM) preferentially self-assemble in the 2D structure. The additives were introduced to suppress the growth along the [101] direction to form the Mela-DM·HCl microrod core. As shown in Fig. 3h, the various melaminium derivatives acted as additives to modulate the core morphology, and adsorbed its surface as the shell. The typical SEM image (Fig. 3i) indicates the well-defined Mela-DM/Mela-M-Pym core/shell microrods. Furthermore, the OCSSs were finely controlled via adjusting the total concentration of the core and shell components, and their corresponding molar ratio. Additionally, Fu and co-workers presented a facile solute exchange strategy for epitaxial growth of BPEA molecules to obtain the BPEA/(BPEA)x(5,12-bis(phenylethynyl)naphthacene (BN))1−x core/shell microrods based on the perfect lattice.18 In a typical instance, the as-prepared BPEA tubes were utilized as the seed and added to the (BPEA)0.72(BN)0.28 alloy-saturated supernatant. Owing to the perfect lattice mismatch of 2.28%, the surface molecules of the BPEA seeded microrods were partially replaced by (BPEA)0.72(BN)0.28 alloy through the dynamic assembly and disassembly process.3 The present solute exchange process results in the OCSSs, which is similar to the formation of inorganic or metal core/shell nanostructures via cation exchange strategy.81,82 The FM images (Fig. 3j and k) respectively show that a bright red-emitting layer is deposited onto a yellow-emitting tube with blue light excitation, and a dark red-emitting layer with a nonemissive center is clearly discovered under the excitation with green light. These powerful evidences affirm the formation of the BPEA/(BPEA)0.72(BN)0.28 core/shell nanostructure. Inspired by the similar principle, the reversible protonation or deprotonation process of the pyridine group was also applied to prepare the DPEpe-based OCSSs.83 Typically, the self-assembled DPEpe or DPEpe-HCl microrods were placed into the HCl or NH3 gas atmosphere. After the DPEpe or DPEpe-HCl molecules at the surface transformed into their protonated or deprotonated state (DPEpe-HCl or DPEpe) acting as the shell part, further protonation or deprotonation process was prevented. Then, the DPEpe/DPEpe-HCl or DPEpe-HCl/DPEpe core/shell microrods were controllably prepared.82 Furthermore, the protection of the shell layer can passivate the reversible protonation or deprotonation process of molecules at the core nanowires, resulting in a stable state. The solute exchange process has achieved huge success in inorganic or metal core/shell structures, and also demonstrated great advantages in constructing OCSSs as introduced above. Therefore, it clearly forecasts that the solute exchange process can be an important method for the construction of OCSSs.
3. Vapor deposition, electrospinning and inkjet printing for organic core/shell structures
The solvent-molecular intermolecular interactions based on the solubleness are the primary requirement for solution self-assembly for the formation of the organic low dimension micro/nanostructures.84 The insoluble molecules, whose sublimated or evaporated temperature is lower than their decomposed temperature, also can self-assembly into the well-defined micro/nanocrystals via the vapor deposition method.85 Yao J. N. and co-workers have made great efforts in the controlled self-assembly of the organic micro/nanostructure via vapor deposition process.86–88 They further realized the controlled self-assembly of the OCSSs through the vapor deposition method.17 Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-pyridyl)-porphyrin (H2TPyP), which have remarkable photoelectric properties20,89,90 and the high thermal stabilities,91 have been selected to prepare the OCSSs. In a typical synthesis, the quartz boats respectively filling with H2TPyP and CuPc were sent into the quartz tube at center and upstream locations in a horizontal chamber furnace. The argon gas plays two roles here: purging oxygen from the tube and carrying the molecular vapor to the low-temperature zone for collecting product on the Si(100) substrates. In such a vapor-solid self-assembled process (Fig. 4a), the H2TPyP nanoparticles were obtained in the initial stage. Due to the favorable absorption process at the surface of H2TPyP with the fast grew at high temperature, then the H2TPyP nanoparticles evolve into the open-ended structures and acting as the high surface energy areas for the selective heteronucleation of CuPc. With a suitable cooling rate of 2 °C min−1, the CuPc then nucleated on the tip of the H2TPyP hollow structure and grew into the nanowires. The H2TPyP/CuPc core/shell nanowires were prepared after the separate growth and wrapped process of H2TPyP for CuPc. The SEM images (Fig. 3b) suggest the CuPc nanowires growing on the tip of the vertical H2TPyP open-ended structure in the well-defined coaxial core/shell structure. The TEM images with the SAED and EDX patterns (Fig. 4c and d) taken from the junction agree with those of pure H2TPyP for CuPc microcrystals, and further confirm the formation of the core/shell structure.

The synergistic effect of the synthesis demonstrates the novel advantage for the controlled self-assembly of the organic micro/nanostructures. A representative case is that the synergy approach of the bottom-up and top-down processes was utilized to controllably prepare the (E)-3-(4-(dimethylamino)-2-methoxyphenyl)-1-(1-hydroxynaphthalen-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one (DMHP) nanowires with a uniform diameter of ∼120 nm through stepwise evolution processes from microrods to microtubes, and finally to nanowires.92 The synergy approach has also realized the controlled construction of the OCSSs.93 First, the N,N′-bis(2-phenylethyl)perylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (BPE-PTCDI) seeded nanowires were finely prepared via the nonsolvent nucleation-mediated recrystallization method. Then, the epitaxial growth of the rubrene crystals via vapor deposition method with the help of an Ar carrier gas leads to the formation of the BPE-PTCDI/rubrene core/shell nanostructures. Electrospinning, which is a well-established and straightforward technique with simple high-throughput, the facile uniaxial alignment, and the easy transfer of fibers to any substrates has generated immense scientific interest to fabricate the organic micro/nanostructures, notably the OCSSs.94,95 The co-axial electrospinning setup (Fig. 4e) has been employed to prepare the OCSSs by the Cho group.96 P3HT and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were selected as the core materials, and the polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was employed as the shell material. The typical TEM image (Fig. 4f) displays a clear contrast between the surface and the center, which suggests the formation of the well-defined core/shell structure. Annealing treatment at 120 °C for 20 min to remove the PVP shell led to the P3HT:PCBM fiber (Fig. 4g). The P3HT:PCBM/poly(caprolactone) (PCL) and PS/PMMA core/shell fibers were also controllably prepared via the coaxial electrospinning.97,98
Inkjet printing has emerged as an attractive patterning technique in the mass production of multifunctional micro/nanostructures for organic flexible electronics.61,99 Since the pioneer work by Prof. Bao and coworkers, the skin electronics based on intrinsically stretchable polymer transistor arrays with high yield and uniformity were controllably prepared via inkjet printing.100 Notably, the inkjet printing also demonstrates considerable potential application in integrated photonic devices.101 Zhao and coworkers have inspired great effort toward organic micro/nanostructure arrays for photonic devices via inkjet printing.102,103 Recently, their group further developed inkjet printing to achieve the all-color laser display panels based on OCSS arrays with dual-wavelength lasing.104 A thin layer of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane coated on the substrate surface is an indispensable element to induce hydrophobicity for the formation of the hemispherical geometry of the hydrophilic shell structure.105 PS and hydrophobic bovine serum albumin (BSA) were applied to the core and shell matrix materials, respectively, which were attributed to their distinct polarities and high transmittance in the visible range. As schematically shown in Fig. 4h, the hydrophilic ink solution was first sprayed on a hydrophobic substrate to prepare the PS shell. Then, the BSA ink was printed at the same position and subsequently encapsulated into the PS interior of the shell to form the core. It is well known that the phase-separation or homogeneous-nucleation leads to a huge challenge in realizing the controlled construction of the organic heterostructures.18,19,21 In such novel approach, the phase-separation plays a crucial role in the formation of the core/shell structure. The distinct surface tension between hydrophilic and hydrophobic ink solutions results in the desired phase-separation of the core and shell materials for the formation of the core/shell structures (Fig. 4i). The clear boundary between the red-core and green-shell segments suggests the formation of the OCSSs, as verified in Fig. 4j–l. The red/blue and green/blue core/shell arrays were also finely fabricated (Fig. 4m and 4n).
4. Optoelectronic applications of organic core/shell structure
The core/shell micro/nanostructures introducing a donor–acceptor heterojunction interface have presented an enticing prospect for innovative optoelectronic devices, owing to their expanded heterojunction area with good connection, the short excited carriers collection lengths, and good photon confinement effect.32 The organic semiconductor with the outstanding flexible and stretchable characters are potential candidates for the advanced devices, e.g., wearable or implantable devices.105,106 Therefore, OCSSs with high molecule packing orientations are beneficial to the high-performance integration-devices. These as-prepared OCSSs have been applied for photovoltaic conversion, optical waveguide and visualization applications, such as ambipolar charge transport, photonic detection, harvesting field, photonic communication, logical gate and sensing devices, biophotonics and full-color display, as summarized in Table 2.

4.1. Photovoltaic conversion for photonic detection and harvesting
The core/shell structures holding the outstanding rectifying/photovoltaic effect and active photo-responsive electrical characteristic are favored for high-quality optoelectronic devices. As shown in Fig. 5a, the 1D H2TPyP/CuPc core/shell structure was applied in the photoelectrical device via the “organic ribbon mask” technique.107 The work function of the Al/Au asymmetrical electrodes have a good match with the energy level of the H2TPyP/CuPc core/shell structure (inset of Fig. 5a), which were beneficial to reducing the energy barrier for the effective charge-injection. Under the illumination with different light intensities, the typical current–voltage (I–V) curves (Fig. 5b) of the above photoelectrical device implied that the CuPc-H2TPyP heterojunction displays the typical diode characteristics, and the excellent rectifying property at room temperature. The current across the nanowire has a dramatic increase from the illumination state to the dark current state, as verified in Fig. 5c, which suggests remarkable photo-switch features with a switching ratio of around 100. Altogether, these observations imply that the core/shell structures have prominent advantages for the injection and transport of the carriers at the heterojunction in the core/shell structure to construct highly sensitive photodetectors. Notably, the HBC/TNF coaxial core/shell nanotubular structure also demonstrated a sensitive photoconductive response with a large on/off ratio of more than 104.32 In sharp contrast, microfibers consisting of the same components exhibited almost no photocurrent generation. P3HT and PCBM are the high-efficiency electric donor–acceptor pair acting as photoactive materials. The electrospinning P3HT:PCBM core/shell fibers have a PCBM-rich core and P3HT-rich shell phase with P3HT chains aligned along their direction, which were applied as photoactive materials to construct the flexible lateral organic solar cells (Fig. 5d) and large-area organic solar cells (inset of Fig. 5e) via photolithography and lift-off processes.96 After introducing three cells connected in series, the open-circuit voltage displayed an obvious enhancement from 0.2 to 0.8 V (Fig. 5e). Furthermore, the interdigitated modular device shows a high open-circuit photo-voltage of over 1.8 V and a short circuit photocurrent at around 150 pA (Fig. 5f).

The core/shell structure can provide unique interfacial CT doping layers at the heterojunction, which is good for high electric conductivity, and a chemical-gating feature of the threshold voltage.16 The UV/Vis absorption spectrum of the CN-TFMBE/P3HT core/shell structure exhibits a CT absorption band at 755 nm, which implies the formation of the CT doping layer.108,109 The well-matching energy levels between P3HT and CN-TFMBE (Fig. 5g) effectively facilitated electron transfer from the P3HT layer to the CN-TFMBE layer, which makes efficient use of the enhanced electron conduction. The I–V curve (Fig. 5h) shows that the current of the CN-TFMBE/P3HT core/shell structure is recreated by more than two orders of magnitude over that of the pristine P3HT. Furthermore, the calculated conductivity values of both CN-TFMBE/P3HT core/shell structure and pristine P3HT are 2.8 × 10−4 and 1.7 S cm−1, respectively. The formed CT doping layer facilitates the mobile-carrier accumulation, resulting in a positive threshold voltage (90 V) in the core/shell-based OFETs (Fig. 5i), while the pristine P3HT-based OFETs demonstrated the threshold voltage of −8 V. Finally, the OFETs based on the CN-TFMBE/P3HT core/shell structures can realize the light emitting-diode property (Fig. 5j). Furthermore, the BPE-PTCDI/rubrene core/shell structure demonstrated ambipolar charge transport characteristics, whose average electron and hole mobilities are (6.01 ± 0.42) × 10−2 and (3.78 ± 1.21) × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.
4.2. Optical waveguide for photonic communication, logical gate and sensing
Optical waveguides based on transparent media can keep light transmitting internally by total reflection at the interface, which has been widely applied in modern fiber optics communication.110 The core/shell structure is the optimum selection for the optical signal transferring over tens of kilometers away.111 The optical waveguide presents enticing prospect applications in optical computing systems.4,112,113 The minimal losses and negligible crosstalk of the optical waveguide are the practical requirements for the integrated optical systems (Fig. 6a).114,115 The core/shell structures provide the individual fugitive shells for the physical separation of optical signal at each crossover point.116 Furthermore, Lewis and co-worker demonstrated an optical waveguide network based on the core/shell structures (Fig. 6b), which is coupled to three different colors of LED light and carry multiple signals.

Notably, the electron and energy transported processes introduced by the excitons are helpful for achieving the novel waveguide behaviors, such as the white light emission waveguide88,117 and multicolor waveguide.83 However, the realization approaches to the above novel waveguide behaviors were limited by the supersensitive color change with the doping ratio and instability.110 Fortunately, the core/shell structure demonstrates the unique tunable emission color, photon confinement effect and stable output multicolor light.118 During the increase in the photon propagation distance, the DPEpe/DPEpe-HCl core/shell nanowire demonstrates a dramatic red emission shift from green to yellow (Fig. 6c). In addition, the DPEpe- HCl/DPEpe core/shell nanowire demonstrates a dramatic blue emission shift from red to yellow (Fig. 6d).83 This suggests that a multicolor continuous-variable optical waveguide from green to yellow and to red was achieved in the organic DPEpe-based core/shell structures via adjusting the photon propagation distance. The OCSSs with outstanding tunable optical properties are promising candidates for the integrated organic photonics. The passive or active mode waveguides for the photon modulation and processing119,120 can be simultaneously achieved in the heterostructures, including the core/shell structure,19,118 branched structure,15,23,121 multiblock structure7,122,123 and others. The dumbbell-like core/shell nanowires (DB-C/S NWs) demonstrate a novel spatially dependent multicolor emission and selective output emission properties,19 which hold various potential photonic applications. Depending on these interesting advantages, the DB-C/S NWs were used in the optical logic gate and the multiple input/output channels encoding/decoding (Fig. 6e). This photonics logic gate has four output channels at both tips and junctions. When the input signal injected in Input 1, as implied in Fig. 6f, Output 3 is dark, while the other output channels are bright. When the input signal injected in Input 2, as implied in Fig. 6g, Output 1 and Output 4 are bright, and Output 2 and Output 3 are dark. When the input signal injected in Input 3, as implied in Fig. 6h, Output 2 is dark, while the other output channels are bright. The bright and dark states of the output channel were respectively defined as optical signals of 0 and 1. These states respectively correspond to the information codes of 1101, 1001, and 1011, which are the high-fidelity signals with the help of the absolute dark-state.
The high surface-to-volume ratio of the 1D micro/nanostructures is good for the increased diffusion of gas molecules, rendering them to be promising candidates for miniaturized sensors.124 The rationally constructed BPEA/CPPO core/shell nanowires demonstrated the outstanding coupling between the core and shell, enabling optical changes in the nanowire waveguide. This is beneficial for the promising application in spectral analysis in the visible region for H2O2.22 As shown in Fig. 6i, the 1D core/shell structures with waveguiding BPEA nanowire core and chemiluminogenic COPPA shell cladding were utilized to fabricate the H2O2 sensor with rapid and sensitive detection. These optical waveguide sensors possess several unique advantages, which are unreachable in those based on single-component or uniformly doped nanowires. These advantages included the identity information detection for the aim gas, the enhanced universality and stability for light in-/out-coupling positions from the sensing region, and the quick diffusion of the aim gas molecules. Fig. 6j demonstrated an overview of the single-mode waveguide device of organic core–shell nanowires for optical sensing in the air. It illustrates the great sensitivity for the trace amount detection of H2O2. Fig. 6k demonstrates that the input light has excellent immunity for H2O2, and the exposing time just influences the output light. The difference in the optical transmission between the H2O2-free and H2O2, which exposed signals over the initial transmittance level, is defined as the optical sensor response.
4.3. Solid laser for biophotonics and full-color display
Compared with a single laser material with unordered distribution, the laser arrays demonstrate more significance for their practical display application.125,126 The multi-color or multi-wavelength laser displays, with outputs spanning the full visible spectrum, demonstrate a wider achievable color gamut, high monochromaticity and brightness.127,128 Therefore, the multi-color laser arrays present an enticing prospect for revolutionizing the display industry with a higher contrast ratio and more vivid colors. However, high-energy lasing based on the multicomponent material system suffers from severe suppression after the absorption of the narrow-gap material.10 It is confirmed that the spatially separating different gain materials are an alternative solution to the above problem via minimizing the reabsorption.118 In this regard, Zhao and co-worker demonstrated the organic arrays of the core/shell structure for the all-color laser display panels.103 As shown in Fig. 7a, strong red (606 nm) and green (555 nm) emission laser properties were obtained after the excitation power over their respective thresholds, which correspond to focusing the laser beam at the core and shell regions, respectively. The thresholds for lasing at 555 and 606 nm are 34.9 and 51.5 μJ cm−2, respectively. Due to the spatial separation, both core and shell structures can act as independent optical feedbacks for the two doped dyes to realize the laser. Therefore, the dual-color lasing (red/green, red/blue and green/blue) in the printed core/shell heterostructure with simultaneous pumping above their thresholds at the shell and core structures was verified (Fig. 7a–c). The CIE chromaticity diagram of the as-printed core/shell structures (Fig. 7d) has a four-primary color system (blue, green, uranic and red color), which can cover 66% more perceptible colors than that of RGB. The printed core/shell heterostructure arrays with such a large color gamut suggest huge superiority in the excellent color saturation for the vivid display. Three “ABC” patterns made up a series of microlaser arrays (Fig. 7e) by rationally printing hydrophobic/hydrophilic laser dye inks on an identical substrate, which were employed to obtain the far-field image of the fabricated patterns with a build-in digital camera in a cell. Furthermore, a display of a world map image (2.2 cm in diagonal size, Fig. 7f) based on the organic core/shell heterostructure arrays was prepared by selectively printing hydrophilic/hydrophobic ink solution with desired emission color droplet at specific positions on substrates with predesigned digital patterns. It suggests an approach of achieving a full-color laser display.

5. Conclusion and outlook
Inorganic and metal core/shell structures have made great achievements in both fundamental research and practical applications of biomedical, optoelectronic, catalytic and other fields.26,27,31 Due to the fascinating properties and widespread optoelectronic application of organic semiconductors,129–131 it is necessary to introduced the progress of OCSSs in organic optoelectronics Herein, we have summarized six methods developed recently for constructing OCSSs via sequential crystallization or stepwise seeded growth strategies: microemulsion synthesis, solution self-assembly, vapor-phase self-assembly, electrospinning and inkjet printing approach. These as-prepared OCSSs have achieved remarkable success in the optoelectronic application of the photovoltaic conversion in ambipolar charge transport, photonic detection and harvesting field, optical waveguide in photonic communication, logical gate and sensing devices and solid-state laser applied in biophotonics and full-color display. Furthermore, these OCSSs will provide outstanding heterojunction platforms and guide new opportunities for developing advanced organic optoelectronics.
Notably, it is worth emphasizing that these OCSSs investigations are just starting to be explored, and there is plenty of room for further innovations, especially in small molecule core/shell structures. Indeed, only limited cases based on high chemical/structural compatibility with perfect lattice matching between the core and shell layers (lattice mismatching rate f < 3%) of the small molecule system have been realized so far,132e.g., the BEPA/(BPEA)x(BN)1−x core/shell microrod. All reported examples based on small molecules are microsphere or 1D micro/nanostructures, and most only have a single shell structure. Based on the great success of the 2D core/monoshell structures and the core/multishell structures based on the inorganic/metal component in abundant applications, it is clearly forecast that the organic multi-shell or 2D core/shell structures could demonstrate great preponderance in nanoscience and nanotechnology for more diverse innovation.
However, it is still a significant challenge to rationally construct the organic multi-shell or 2D core/shell structures, which is attributed to the great challenges in designing appropriate material pairs with compatible structures and regulating their self-assembly in a rational manner. Therefore, it is necessary to design appropriate material pairs with perfect lattice matching and explore the growth mechanism for OCSSs. The cocrystal engineering perspectives are expected to promote further developments in OCSSs, along with the progress in exploring the advancement of material processing techniques. Notably, the cocrystal engineering, as an emerging functional material-design strategy, provides great opportunities to design and prepare the organic cocrystal micro/nanostructures after facilely regulating the cocrystal donor or acceptor, which not only possess diverse optoelectronic functions, but also have desired compatible structures. In particular, the hierarchical self-assembly method (by regulating the intermolecular interactions) has realized the controllable fabrication of diversified organic heterostructures. It is predicted that the fine synthesis of the organic multi-shell or 2D core/shell structures will be realized with the help of both cocrystal engineering and the hierarchical self-assembly method by regulating the intermolecular interactions, as well as demonstrate exciting optoelectronic applications. The fine synthesis of the organic core/shell structure is crucial for the fundamental scientific understanding and worthy industrial application.
