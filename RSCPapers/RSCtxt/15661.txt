    , Accepted 8th September 2020First published on 9th September 2020AbstractThe electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has attracted great attention recently for ammonia synthesis at ambient temperature and pressure and exhibits largely reduced energy consumption for ammonia production compared with the traditional Haber–Bosch process. The rational design and optimization of NRR electrocatalysts are critically important for breaking the triple bond between nitrogen atoms and the subsequent formation of the N–H bond. Cu-based materials have recently been developed as promising electrocatalysts by various morphology and electronic structure modulation strategies for efficient NRR thanks to the 3d transition metal structure, low cost, high reserves, and excellent catalytic performance of Cu. To further explore new possibilites in this area, in this review, the rational modulation of Cu-based electrocatalysts is used as a typical example to summarize various design strategies effectively enhancing the ammonia yield and conversion efficiency for the NRR. Following a brief presentation of the reaction mechanism of the NRR, five strategies for altering the structure and properties of Cu-based electrocatalysts, namely morphology modulation, alloy engineering, lattice phase regulation, vacancy engineering and single-atom structure construction, are comprehensively summarized and the relationship between the catalyst modulation and corresponding NRR performance is discussed. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of the NRR are presented.
1. Introduction
Ammonia (NH3) is an important chemical product and is widely used in fertilizer synthesis, pharmaceuticals, energy storage and many other fields.1–3 The typical synthesis methods of ammonia mainly include biological nitrogen fixation, the Haber–Bosch process and electrocatalysis.4 However, the natural biological nitrogen fixation catalyzed by nitrogenase enzymes cannot match the current huge demand of the fertilizer industry. Moreover, the industrial Haber–Bosch process conducted at high temperature and pressure suffers greatly from high energy consumption, low hydrogen equilibrium conversion rate and severe equipment requirements.5,6 Besides, the hydrogen required in the process is mainly generated by the steam reformation of natural gas, which results in huge energy depletion and serious greenhouse gas emissions. Accordingly, it will be essential to develop sustainable and environmentally friendly approaches for ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions.
The electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction provides a promising route for clean and sustainable N2 fixation due to its low carbon emissions, low energy consumption, and ambient temperature and pressure operations.7 The electrocatalytic NRR in aqueous solution usually uses H2O as the proton source and the process can be powered by electricity generated from clean and renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind or geothermal energy). Although significant progress has been achieved in electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction, the current ammonia yield and faradaic efficiency (FE) of the NRR still need to be much enhanced due to the slow kinetics of N2 molecule adsorption and the high bond energy of the NN covalent triple bond.8 The electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction is a six-electron transfer process, while the major competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a two-electron transfer process with similar equilibrium potential compared to the NRR in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes, as shown in eqn (1)–(4).1,6,9 Thus, it is of great significance to construct specific electrocatalysts that prefer binding N-atoms to H-atoms to suppress the HER while enhancing the selectivity for the NRR. N2 + 6H+ + 6e− ⇌ 2NH3(g), E0 = +0.55 V vs. NHE(1) 2H+ + 2e− ⇌ H2, E0 = 0 V vs. SHE at pH = 0(2) N2 + 6H2O + 6e− ⇌ 2NH3 + 6OH−, E0 = −0.736 V vs. SHE at pH = 14(3) 2H2O (l) + 2e− ⇌ H2(g) + 2OH−, E0 = −0.828 V vs. SHE at pH = 14(4)
A series of electrocatalysts have been constructed for the NRR under ambient conditions including noble metal, non-noble metal and metal-free electrocatalysts.10,11 At present, noble metal-based electrocatalysts like Ru-12 and Au-based compounds13,14 are among the catalysts with the highest activity for ammonia synthesis, while their scarcity and high costs make their large-scale application almost impossible. Therefore, the use of novel noble-metal-free electrocatalysts is of great significance. Transition metal-based electrocatalysts are regarded as promising catalysts for the NRR on account of the π-back donation feature based on the availability of d-band electrons that enable the activation and cleavage of N2.15,16 Owing to the transition metal electronic structure, high reserves and low cost of Cu (3d104s1),17,18 Cu-based electrocatalysts have attracted widespread interest and achieved significant progress for efficient nitrogen reduction recently. Rational catalyst design strategies such as morphology engineering, defect introduction and component regulation play significant roles in optimizing the morphology and structure of catalysts to further increase the catalytic activity and active site densities for an enhanced N2 reduction response.3,19,20 The NRR performances of Cu-based electrocatalysts have achieved significant enhancement with the NH3 production rates reported mostly being at the level of tens of micrograms per hour per microgram of the catalyst. In particular, a FE of 54.96% can be obtained when coupling Cu with Au, which is higher than that of most noble-metal catalysts.3,7,21
Electrochemical N2 reduction for ammonia synthesis has attracted great attention recently, and a series of reviews on the significant progress of the NRR have been published. Wan and coworkers3 discussed and summarized various electrocatalysts applied in the NRR based on the classification of material chemical compositions and modification strategies. Yan and coworkers22 used a certain catalyst design strategy, namely the single-atom strategy, as the theme and summarized the detailed progress achieved in the rational design, synthesis, and characterization of atomic catalysts for enhanced NRR performance. Although most of the published reviews on the NRR currently are comprehensive and excellent, specific and in-depth reviews on the development and structural regulation of a certain kind of catalytic material, especially non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts for efficient NRR, are still rare. Considering the significant progress reported on Cu-based NRR electrocatalysts, we here use the rational modulation of Cu-based electrocatalysts as a typical example to summarize various catalyst design strategies for the catalytic performance enhancement of NRR electrocatalysts. First, we will illustrate the fundamental reaction mechanism of the NRR. Then various strategies to modify the structure and properties of Cu-based electrocatalysts for efficient nitrogen reduction will be highlighted including morphology modulation, alloy engineering, lattice phase regulation, vacancy engineering and single-atom structure construction. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives will be presented.
2. Reaction mechanisms of the NRR
Electrochemical N2 reduction takes place through a multistep proton–electron transfer approach and the overall catalytic reduction process is commonly observed to follow eqn (1) and (3).23 According to eqn (5), the initial hydrogenation on nitrogen requires an extremely negative redox potential. There are two possible reactant intermediates, i.e., diazene (N2H2) and hydrazine (N2H4), which form by a two-electron pathway and a four-electron pathway, respectively, expressed as eqn (6) and (7), during the partial NRR.21 These highly negative equilibrium potentials for the generation of intermediate species highlights the quite large thermodynamic barrier and the consequently slow kinetics of N2 reduction. N2 + H+ + e− ⇌ N2H, E0 = −3.2 V vs. RHE(5) N2 + 2H+ + 2e− ⇌ N2H2(g), E0 = −1.10 V vs. RHE(6) N2 + 4H+ + 4e− ⇌ N2H4(g), E0 = −0.36 V vs. RHE(7)
The nitrogen reduction reaction on heterogeneous catalysts can proceed through two distinct pathways: dissociative and associative mechanisms, as shown in Fig. 1.24 In the dissociative pathway, the dinitrogen molecules adsorbed on the catalyst active sites first undergo breakage of the NN covalent bond, and then the dissociated N atoms start the hydrogenation process to form NH3. Since the NN triple bond features rather high dissociation energy thermodynamically, the dissociation of N2 according to this mechanism necessitates extremely high energy input. The industrial Haber–Bosch process mainly proceeds through such a dissociative mechanism. In the associative pathway alternatively, hydrogenation occurs on the adsorbed N2 molecules on catalysts without the advanced cleavage of the NN bond. The associative pathway can be completed via two possible routes according to the hydrogenation method: the distal route and the alternating route. In the distal associative mechanism, the hydrogenation process preferentially takes place at the distal N atoms to form and release the first NH3, and then the proximal N atom proceeds through reductive protonation and gives the second NH3, while in the alternating route, the distal and proximal N atoms undergo hydrogenation alternately until two NH3 molecules are generated sequentially. The electrocatalytic NRR mainly follows the associative mechanism.

During the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction process, the transition metal donates its available d-band electrons to the N–N antibonding orbital to promote the adsorption of N2 and effectively weaken the NN triple bond.8,17 The electronic structure of transition metals mainly features d orbitals, which can easily give or accept electrons to facilitate the adsorption and activation of reactants. Thus, it is of great importance to tune the electronic structure of transition-metal-based electrocatalysts to facilitate the activation and hydrogenation of N-species and in the meantime inhibit the parallel HER for selective nitrogen reduction. Due to its high abundance, low cost and transition metal electronic structure, Cu-based electrocatalysts are used here as a typical example to summarize the recent advances of structure and property modulation strategies for the advanced electrochemical NRR.
3. Modulation strategies of Cu-based catalysts for the NRR

3.1 Morphology modulation
Morphology modulation is an effective catalyst design strategy to expose specific active facets and increase active site densities for promoting the catalytic reaction through optimizing the synthetic conditions of catalysts (e.g., temperature and pH value) or introducing selective capping agents.3,37,38 It has been demonstrated that materials with oriented spikes on the surface can result in a much focused electric field at the sharp tips to concentrate the reactants nearby, thus facilitating the reaction.39,40 Sun's group designed a dendritic copper nanostructure composed of surface abundant and oriented nanospikes by a galvanic replacement approach for the electrocatalytic NRR.25 The dendritic Cu exhibited favorable NRR performance with an NH3 yield rate (VNH3) of 25.63 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 and a FE of 15.12% at −0.40 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M HCl. Besides, the dendritic Cu nanostructure showed a remarkably high selectivity for N2 fixation to NH3 with no possible by-product of N2H4 detected during the NRR.
Chen's group explored the influence of Cu nanostructures on the efficiency of electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis via varying the thickness of surface Cu layers on a carbon paper (CP) substrate to facilitate surface mass transfer (Fig. 2).41 The Cu nanoparticles were electrodeposited on CP through the galvanostatic reduction of Cu2+ under acidic conditions and the thickness of Cu layers was altered by the electrodeposition time interval. When the electrodeposition period was tuned to 2 min, the as-synthesized Cu-2 sample displayed a monolayer structure grown on a carbon fibre substrate, which minimized the surface mass transfer barrier, and thus the nitrogen reduction FE on Cu-2 reached a maximum of 33.0% among a series of samples with varied deposition time periods and layer thicknesses. In this study, the intrinsic activity presented by the normalized NH3 yield rate was further calculated to investigate the effect of surface mass transfer on the catalytic reduction activity. As shown in Fig. 2(c), with the increase of the Cu layer thickness, the sample showed decreased activity due to the large mass transfer barrier, and thus the Cu-2 sample with the monolayer copper structure exhibited a maximum mass activity of 12.0 μg h−1 mg−1 at 0.0 V vs. RHE. Additionally, the same group assembled an innovative Zn–N2 aqueous battery combining electricity generation and ammonia synthesis with a remarkably high FE of 59% for the NRR. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the (220) lattice plane of Cu offers active sites for nitrogen adsorption and ammonia synthesis. The electrocatalytic NRR mechanism on the Cu-based catalysts has been identified to follow the associative alternating pathway according to the DFT calculations and in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis.

Besides the above strategies of dendritic structure construction and thickness control used in Cu-based catalysts, morphology modulation has also been adopted for structural regulation of other NRR electrocatalysts. For instance, hollow gold nanocages,42 Au flowers43 and multi-shelled hollow Cr2O3 microspheres44 were fabricated for nitrogen reduction, and all these catalysts offered much enhanced catalytic performances compared with the corresponding electrocatalysts of other morphologies, benefiting from the abundant exposed/concentrated active sites from their specific morphology and structure.
3.2 Alloy engineering
Composition regulation provides another efficient strategy for catalytic activity and performance enhancement. Alloy engineering can realize the regulation of the electronic structure and properties of each metal to promote the adsorption and activation of reactants on the catalyst surface. Conventional strategies for bimetallic alloy synthesis mainly include co-reduction, concurrent thermolysis and galvanic replacement. In addition, a number of specific strategies such as pulsed laser ablation and γ-ray irradiation have also been developed to overcome the inherent immiscibility between the two types of metals in bimetallic materials.45,46 Wang's group constructed bimetallic Ag3Cu porous networks (Ag3Cu BPNs) through one-pot NaBH4 reduction, in which the two metal precursors were first reduced simultaneously under the strong reduction of NaBH4 and then self-assembled to nucleate and grew to form an alloy in several minutes.26 The Ag3Cu BPNs were interconnected by abundant nanoparticles, which were generated by the fusion of metal nuclei caused by the rapid reduction. A high NH3 production rate of 24.59 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 with a corresponding FE of 13.28% can be achieved by Ag3Cu BPNs at −0.5 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M Na2SO4, resulting from the interconnected pore structure and designed component ratio. Compared with the corresponding porous monometallic samples (Ag: 6.57 μg h−1 mgcat.−1; Cu: 5.84 μg h−1 mgcat.−1), the NH3 production rate of Ag3Cu BPNs was significantly elevated, which has been attributed to the strong electronic interplay in bimetallic Ag3Cu that promotes the activation of reactants and intermediates. Moreover, due to the tunable structure and component ratio of bimetallic materials, catalysts with varied Ag/Cu ratios show divergent NRR performance, and the Ag3Cu BPNs with the optimized component ratio feature balanced active Ag and Cu sites, thus exhibiting optimum nitrogen reduction performance.
Dong's group synthesized bimetallic AuCu nanowires by one-step NaBH4 coreduction, which exhibited optimal NRR performance in comparison with other Au-based bimetallic nanocatalysts in this series (AuAg, AuPd and AuRu).27 The outstanding nitrogen reduction response of AuCu benefits from the enhanced synergy between the two metal atoms due to the electronic structure regulation by Cu incorporation into the Au lattice, which facilitates their interplay with the reactants and the subsequent intermediates. In addition, it turned out that the designed Au1Cu1 catalyst with the optimized composition ratio exhibited superior NRR activity with an NH3 generation rate of 154.91 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 and a FE of 54.96% at −0.2 V vs. RHE in 0.05 M H2SO4.
Pang and coworkers developed bimodal PdCu alloys with a three-dimensional (3D) porous structure and designed component ratios through the two-step de-alloying of the PdCuAl ternary precursor.28 The Pd3Cu1 alloy delivered an outstanding NH3 generation rate of 39.9 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 and a FE of 1.22% at −0.25 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH, outperforming other composed PdCu alloys. The significantly improved NRR catalytic performance of the Pd3Cu1 alloy has been ascribed to the optimized Pd/Cu ratio that regulates the electronic structure of the alloy and hinders the competitive HER effectively. Simultaneously, the 3D bimodal structure provides large surface areas and pore volumes for enhanced active site density and favorable accessibility for reactant molecules, endowing the bimodal nanoporous Pd3Cu1 alloy with a higher NH3 yield rate and FE than those of its nanoparticulate Pd3Cu1 counterpart.
Chen's group fabricated bimetallic RhCu ultrathin nanoflake nanoaggregates (RhCu–BUNNs) via a hydrothermal approach as both cathode and anode catalysts for the NRR and glycerol oxidation, respectively (Fig. 3).29 Since the competitive HER was significantly weakened owing to the structural and electronic effects originating from Cu introduction, the NH3 yield rate and NRR FE of RhCu–BUNNs (95.06 μg h−1 mgcat.−1, 1.5%) underwent prominent enhancement compared with those of monometallic Rh ultrathin nanoflake nanoaggregates (Rh–UNNs) (35 μg h−1 mgcat.−1, 0.3%). Confirmed by DFT calculations, the Cu introduction could remarkably lower the barrier for the reductive protonation of *NN from 0.71 eV to 0.16 eV, which is the potential-determining step (PDS) during the nitrogen reduction process, thus increasing the NRR activity. Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode with the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) results in significantly reduced overall electrolysis voltage and enhanced energy conversion efficiency for the NRR.

Apart from the above Cu-based electrocatalysts, alloy engineering has been applied widely in other metal electrocatalysts. For example, cubic Pt93Ir7 alloy nanocrystals,47 bimetallic PdRu porous nanostructures,48 Ag2Au1 nanotubes,49etc. have been synthesized with designed compositions and optimized electronic structures and demonstrate significantly enhanced electrocatalytic NRR activity compared with the corresponding monometallic catalysts or the nanoalloy counterparts with altered atomic ratios.
3.3 Lattice structure regulation
Lattice structure regulation is a technique to optimize the catalytic performance by regulating the phase structure and the consequent electronic structure of catalysts. The transformation of the lattice structure is usually induced by modulating factors such as dynamic stability, strain, spin, surface energy, etc., which are tuned by parameters like temperature, pressure, external field and so on.50 Huang's group designed structurally ordered body-centered cubic (BCC) PdCu with a marked NH3 generation rate of 35.7 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 and a FE of 11.5% at −0.1 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M LiCl.30 The BCC PdCu nanocatalyst was fabricated through phase conversion of face-centered cubic (FCC) PdCu via thermal annealing in Ar/H2 at 350 °C, and the NH3 production rate of BCC PdCu increased by about two times compared with that for FCC PdCu. The ordered structure obtained by annealing shows reduced apparent activation energy and consequently improved the nitrogen reduction performance significantly. DFT calculation suggested that, in BCC PdCu nanoparticles, the strong d–d orbital interplay between Pd and Cu sites originating from lattice structure regulation effectively diminishes the electron-transfer energy gap for prominent N2 reduction.
3.4 Vacancy engineering
Vacancy engineering is of crucial importance in catalytic reactions since the introducing of vacancies can largely modify the electronic structure of catalysts and tune the surface adsorption features for intermediates. Vacancies are commonly generated when the original atoms in the crystal escape from the lattice structure through processes like light excitation, gas plasma treatment, thermal annealing and chemical reduction.3,37 Zhang's group fabricated Cu-doped CeO2 nanorods via a simple hydrothermal approach followed by thermally treating in H2/Ar.31 The optimal Cu–CeO2-3.9 (when the mass content of the incorporated Cu was 3.9 wt%) with a mesoporous structure showed an NH3 yield of 5.3 × 10−10 mol s−1 cm−2 and a corresponding FE of 19.1% at −0.45 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M Na2SO4, notably surpassing the performance of pure CeO2 nanorods. It has been demonstrated that the doped Cu2+ can substitute the original Ce3+ in the CeO2 lattice and thus generate multiple oxygen vacancies, which are considered the active centers for N2 adsorption and hydrogenation. Besides, the amount of Cu doping in CeO2 is critical for the balanced HER and NRR during the reduction to obtain optimal NRR selectivity.
In addition to oxygen vacancies, nitrogen vacancies in catalysts are another type of lattice defect affecting the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction. Although there are no reports on the role of nitrogen vacancies in copper nitride-based catalysts for the NRR currently, other kinds of nitrides such as W2N3,51 Mo2N,52 and polymeric carbon nitride (PCN)53 electrocatalysts with nitrogen vacancies have been reported, which exhibit significantly augmented activity for N2 reduction.
3.5 Single-atom structure construction
Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have drawn extensive attention in electrocatalysis owing to the maximized active atom utilization efficiency and homogeneous catalytic active site distribution.22,54 However, due to the high surface energy of isolated single atoms, it is a great challenge to uniformly disperse and anchor single atoms on the substrate and prevent their migration and aggregation. Typical strategies for constructing SACs mainly include establishing defects on substrates like vacancies, designing space-confined sites, fabricating coordination sites (such as N, O, and S coordinating atoms with lone-pair electrons), etc., to anchor and stabilize single atoms.22,55 Zang and coworkers synthesized Cu single atoms distributed on a nitrogen-doped carbon substrate (NC–Cu SA) through a surfactant-assisted synthesis method, which exhibited favorable NRR catalytic activity in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes (Fig. 4).32 Porous N-doped carbon (NC) was used as the substrate since the incorporated nitrogen atoms could play the role of the electronic structure regulator and serve as the anchoring sites for single metal atoms in catalyst fabrication. Excellent NRR catalytic response can be obtained by NC–Cu SA with NH3 production rates of ∼53.3 and ∼49.3 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 and FEs of 13.8% and 11.7% in 0.1 M KOH and 0.1 M HCl, respectively, remarkably outperforming the original NC substrate and Cu nanoparticles loaded on NC. DFT calculations identified the Cu–N2 sites in NC–Cu SA as the effective active centers for nitrogen reduction. Moreover, the well-dispersed Cu single atoms resulted in significantly enhanced density of the catalytically active sites.

Apart from the above Cu single atom catalysts, single atom catalysts based on other metals such as Ru SAs/N–C,12 Fe1–N–C,56 and Mo0/GDY57 have also been confirmed as efficient NRR electrocatalysts based on their distinct catalytic performances.
4. Conclusions and perspectives
Sustainable and economical NH3 synthesis directly from N2 is becoming a greatly attractive subject to meet the ever-increasing agricultural and environmental demands. The electrocatalytic NRR at ambient temperature and pressure features minimized carbon emissions, much diminished energy consumption, and easy implementation. Copper-based electrocatalysts have achieved significant success in electrochemical nitrogen-to-ammonia conversion under ambient conditions through structure and property modulation including morphology modulation, alloy engineering, lattice structure regulation, and so on. These modulation strategies offer effectively tailored electronic structures of catalysts by optimizing the morphology, composition, defect generation, etc. for promoting nitrogen reduction via N2 adsorption and activation on exposed active sites with increased density. Nevertheless, the current ammonia yield and conversion efficiency are still far from the industrial requirements. To further promote the development of the electrocatalytic NRR, great attention should be paid to the following issues:
(1) Rational design of novel electrocatalysts
The activity and selectivity for the electrocatalytic NRR can be improved substantially through electronic structure regulation of catalysts to promote the adsorption and activation of N2 and intermediates. Strategies such as morphology and component modulation, defect introduction, lattice facet regulation, etc., are highly expected to modify the electronic structure, increase the active sites and enhance the apparent or intrinsic activity of catalysts. At the same time, the main competitive reaction, the HER, must be largely suppressed by designing NRR-selective catalysts capable of inhibiting the HER during reduction and/or using suitable electrolytes able to control the release of protons.
(2) Electrocatalytic NRR system optimization
The major anodic reaction in the electrocatalytic NRR system is the OER, whose sluggish kinetics generally results in a largely reduced overall electrolysis rate and energy conversion efficiency. Thus, it is of great significance to rationally design anode reactions alternative to the traditional OER, for example, the electrooxidation reaction of small organic molecules (e.g., alcohol and glycerol) with value-added chemicals generated, to lower the whole electrolysis voltage and elevate the NRR performance. Besides, most of the reports on electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis by the NRR are focused on the nitrogen reduction itself currently; however, the combination of nitrogen reduction with other reactions such as carbon dioxide reduction58 to synthesize higher-value products in one step deserves to be paid more attention.
(3) Precise quantification of ammonia
The ammonia generated during the NRR is mainly detected by methods including ion chromatography, spectrophotometry (the salicylate method and Nessler's reagent), use of an ion-selective electrode, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The spectrophotometric method widely used currently is simple and easy to implement, but interference factors such as pH and impurity ions (e.g., Ru3+ and Fe2+) may have a great impact on the accuracy; thus it's desirable to combine spectrophotometry with other methods for parallel detection to ensure precise and repeatable quantification. 15N2 isotope labelling is generally employed to clarify the source of N in products. Considering the rather low ammonia production efficiency currently and effect of various interference factors on accuracy, it is of importance to develop reliable ammonia quantification methods with high sensitivity and rapid in situ detection options.
(4) Theory calculations for experimental guidance
Critical data of the catalytic reactions, such as the adsorption free energy of reactants, the potential active sites of catalysts and the possible catalytic pathway, can be obtained through theoretical calculations for further catalytic system design. Most theoretical calculation models are established under simplified boundary conditions by ignoring the complex environmental factors, which may not fit the multi-step N2 reduction reaction process. Therefore, more rational theoretical calculations are highly desired to be combined with experimental research and then to guide catalyst design and reveal the actual and more detailed catalytic mechanism, such as true pathways and actual active centers, during the NRR. In this respect, the in-depth insights into the regulation of the catalyst electronic structure are expected to offer more useful protocols for substantially promoted adsorption and hydrogenation of nitrogen.
(5) Utilization of in situ characterization techniques

In situ/operando characterization (such as in situ FTIR, in situ Raman, in situ synchrotron radiation techniques, etc.) techniques are suggested to be further used for studying the catalytic mechanism in a more comprehensive and detailed manner, revealing the relationship between the electronic structure and NRR performance, and searching for/designing novel electrocatalysts with enhanced activity. Key knowledge of the precise adsorption state and structure transformation of reactants and intermediates on the catalyst surface during reaction processes can be obtained through the comprehensive employment of multiple in situ characterization techniques, which will help to clarify the actual and detailed N2 reduction pathway. Besides, the extensive utilization of in situ characterization will definitely benefit the optimization of the electronic structure, active facet exposure, morphology, chemical composition, etc. of the catalysts for the activation and reduction of nitrogen, and consequently guide the design and fabrication of advanced catalysts with industry-applicable NRR performance.
