    , Accepted 6th September 2022First published on 7th September 2022AbstractDeveloping new chemistry to passivate the defects in the perovskite layer is highly desired in researching high-performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). We herein explore supramolecular chemistry to passivate the perovskite film by entailing the employment of robust metal–organic polyhedra (MOPs), [Rh2(bdc)2]12 (HRhMOP; bdc = benzene-1,3-dicarboxylate). HRhMOP is found to establish well-defined packing voids to well accommodate the filling of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) that is often used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in PVSCs. Detailed analysis suggests that HRhMOP forms an asymmetric distribution in the PCBM ETL, and the self-arranged HRhMOP at the ETL/perovskite interface considerably suppresses the Pb0 formation and induces a larger band bending effect to facilitate interfacial charge transport. Synergetically combined effects give rise to a 9% enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the derived inverted PVSCs. The successful utilization of MOPs could lead to the further development of supramolecular chemistry in state-of-the-art PVSCs.
Introduction
Over the past decade, organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have swept the photovoltaic (PV) community, and the state-of-the-art power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PVSCs has approached 26%.1 The perovskite material possesses facile low-cost and low-temperature solution processability and promising semiconducting properties, such as intense light-harvesting capability, high carrier mobility, and tunable bandgaps, that enable a highly variable degree of freedom for operation.2–8 Given these advantages, scientists have made tremendous efforts to expedite their transition to commercialization.9 Among them, defect management and grain boundary passivation have attracted the most attention and devotion owing to the polycrystalline feature of the solution-prepared perovskite film.10–12 Accordingly, using additives, interfacial modification, and defect passivation have become the most common strategies to optimize the photovoltaic performance of PVSCs nowadays.13–18
It is worth noting that the emerging nanoporous materials, like metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), have recently demonstrated promising potential for serving as additives or interfacial materials to improve the performance and stability of PVSCs, extending their applications to the PV field.19–27 Characteristics of the nanoporous materials, such as their specific surface areas, pore sizes, and interacting functional groups, can be easily regulated by the constituent building units. They, meanwhile, grant this class of materials feasibility to own suitable optoelectronic properties.28,29 Many researchers have shown that the nanoporous materials can not only enhance the stability of the solution-processed perovskite films but also improve their optoelectronic properties from various aspects due to their exceptional compatibility with the perovskite materials.21–23,27 It has been reported that nanoporous material-mediated perovskite films could possess enhanced light absorption in specific wavelengths, enhanced crystallinity, lower defect states, and better energy-level alignment as well as charge transfer across the associated perovskite interfaces.21,22,25,26 These recent findings warrant more insightful investigations to clarify the structural influence of the nanoporous materials and their interaction behaviors with the perovskite materials at the nanoscale.
Besides MOFs and COFs, metal–organic polyhedra (MOPs), as a new branch of supramolecular chemistry, have also aroused extensive attention in the past decade due to their unique structures and have shown promising potential in chemical sensing,30,31 catalysis,32,33 gas storage,34,35 drug delivery,36 and molecule separation.37,38 Different to MOFs that own extended networks with a long-range structural order, MOPs possess discrete cage-type structures assembled from metal ions/clusters and organic ligands through the formation of coordination bonds and an inherent cavity therein.
Out of interest in this new class of porous materials, this study explores the applications of a highly stable HRhMOP, [Rh2(bdc)2]12 (bdc = benzene-1,3-dicarboxylate), in PVSCs,39 and demonstrates that it could provide multifunctionality to mediate the fullerene electron transport layer (ETL) to improve device performance. We first blended HRhMOP into [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and found that the microporous and mesoporous voids that exist in the unique packing of HRhMOP are helpful to incorporate PCBM into its aggregation. Moreover, we unveiled that this hybrid film tends to form an asymmetric configuration (Fig. 1) that can better modulate the perovskite/PCBM interface. The HRhMOPs sediment near the perovskite/PCBM interface provided enhanced passivation capability for the beneath perovskite film. As a result, the device's performance can be improved from 17.14% (using a pristine PCBM ETL) to 18.64%, showing ∼9% enhancement.

Results and discussion
Compatibility between HRhMOP and PCBM
In this study, we utilized the dirhodium MOP with cuboctahedral geometry, [Rh2(bdc)2]12 (HRhMOP), which is composed of 12 Rh paddlewheel structures that are bridged by 1,3-benzenedicarboxylate (bdc), because of its high chemical stability and the high porosity.39,40 Before we envisaged the application of HRhMOP in PVSCs, we realized from previous research37 that the scope of its pore size matches well with the size of the electron transport material, PCBM, which is a small molecule with a diameter of around 0.7 nm. This fact gives potential compatibility between HRhMOP and PCBM. To explore how PCBM was filled into the interstitial spaces constructed by HRhMOP, we blended a small amount of PCBM with HRhMOP to obtain an HRhMOP:PCBM mixture. We first investigated the porosity of the HRhMOP:PCBM mixture with a weight ratio of 9:1. Fig. 2a presents N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of pure HRhMOP and the HRhMOP:PCBM mixture. Both samples showed a clear type I adsorption behavior, indicating a dominant nanopore characteristic. However, compared to pure HRhMOP, the HRhMOP:PCBM mixture exhibited a slightly reduced hysteresis correlated with a lower mesoporosity. Furthermore, the HRhMOP:PCBM mixture possessed a reduced pore volume from 0.614 to 0.307 cm3 g−1HRhMOP. This significant difference fell into the mesopore region (2–10 nm), as evidenced by the pore size distribution (Fig. 2b). Deduced from these results, it can be envisioned that HRhMOP molecules are aggregated to form nanoparticles with the existence of PCBM, as evidenced by the 1.4 nm extrinsic interstitial space generated between randomly packed neighboring HRhMOPs; moreover, PCBM occupies relatively larger vacancies (2–10 nm), thus blocking the gas diffusion pathway and decreasing the total pore volume.41

(f) XPS Pb (4f) spectra of the perovskite films with and without the HRhMOP passivation. 
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis was next conducted to confirm the chemical bond variation after introducing PCBM into HRhMOP. As can be seen from Fig. 2c, the HRhMOP:PCBM mixture (weight ratio: 9:1) possesses the characteristic peaks of pure HRhMOP and PCBM at the same time. Besides, no additional peaks or shifting were observed, indicating that there could be only van der Waals forces between HRhMOP and PCBM leading to cohesion and no chemical bonds were generated after mixing. Note that the absorption peak at 1610 cm−1 is attributed to the carboxylate stretching vibration of Rh-coordinated bdc, which similarly implies that the molecule structure of HRhMOP was maintained after mixing with PCBM.
Characterization of the HRHMOP:PCBM/perovskite interface
The above results reveal that the void filling arrangement between the HRhMOP and PCBM enables their good miscibility. Based on this, we next explored the possibility of applying HRhMOP as a modified ETL to the perovskite solar cells. First, we utilized an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profile to buildup compositional analysis for the layered ITO/perovskite/HRhMOP:PCBM sample to accurately describe the composition across the layered film. Notably, the HRhMOP:PCBM film was spin-coated on the perovskite film by a hybrid precursor solution containing a trace amount of HRhMOP (2.5 wt%), which was the optimized condition for the hybrid ETL in the device application and is different to the aforementioned case.
As shown in Fig. 2d, three regions can be roughly classified based on the unique elemental distribution. In region I, the carbon signal was predominant, representing the abundant existence of PCBM that is composed of carbon atoms. This suggests that region I mainly consists of PCBM (Fig. 2e). In this study, the used perovskite system consists of lead and iodine, and their signals reach the maximum and share nearly the same distribution in Region III. This suggests that region III stands for the bulk perovskite film (Fig. 2e). Interestingly, between regions I and III, in addition to the lead and iodine signals, the rhodium signal appeared and it became more and more intense on increasing the number of sputtering cycles. Note that the rhodium signal was magnified by 200 times owing to its tiny addition amount. In contrast, the carbon signal was continuously decreasing outside region I and extended to region III. This result suggests that PCBM penetrates the perovskite layer.42,43 Furthermore, the concurrent intensity increases for the rhodium, lead, and iodine signals with a nearly constant ratio across region II suggest that HRhMOP tends to diffuse toward the perovskite/PCBM interface and distribute in the grain boundaries, forming an asymmetric structure with PCBM (Fig. 2e). Notably, a relatively high Pb content that leads to a low I/Pb ratio was observed in our analysis. This may result from the metallic Pb0 formation during the film preparation or the depth profiling process,44,45 which might also result in the surface iodine accumulation. The XPS spectra of Pb (4f) and I (3d) (Fig. S2, ESI†) affirm this issue causing an unusual I/Pb ratio, wherein the additional peak of iodine (I2) at region II (near the perovskite surface) and greater content of Pb0 inside the perovskite bulk film were clearly observed. In conclusion, we successfully reveal the microstructure between the modified ETL and perovskite interface with the XPS depth profile technique and it shows that the HRhMOP inclines to distribute over the perovskite surface during the ETL deposition process.
To examine the interactions between HRhMOP and the perovskite, we first checked the adhesion situation of HRhMOP on the perovskite film by spin-coating a dilute HRhMOP suspension solution (0.5 mg mL−1) on top of it. As presented in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the HRhMOP adheres well to the surface of the perovskite film even under a dilute and suspension state. Fig. 2f compares the XPS Pb (4f) spectra of the perovskite films without and with the adhesion of HRhMOP. As it can be observed, the adhesion of HRhMOP on the perovskite film suppressed the formation of Pb0 species, showing a certain passivation capability.17,46 From the above results, we conclude that HRhMOP mixes well in the PCBM matrix and the resulting asymmetric configuration in the hybrid ETL can better passivate the underneath perovskite film.
Energy-level alignment at the ETL/perovskite interfaces
The passivation exerted by HRhMOP might influence the electrical properties at the ETL/perovskite interface. To elucidate this, we probe the energy-level alignment across the PCBM/perovskite interfaces. Given the observed asymmetric distribution of HRhMOP in the PCBM ETL, two cases were herein studied: (i) a perovskite film without or with HRhMOP surface passivation and (ii) a perovskite film in conjunction with a PCBM ETL or a hybrid HRhMOP:PCBM ETL. Fig. 3a and b first present the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra of the perovskite films without and with HRhMOP surface passivation. As shown, the onsets of secondary electron cutoff for the films without and with HRhMOP surface passivation were 16.71 and 16.82 eV, while the values of valence band maximum (VBM) with respect to the Fermi level for them were 1.12 and 1.27 eV, respectively. Note that the valence band onset in Fig. 3b is determined using a logarithmic intensity scale to reduce the estimation error.47,48 Based on these results and the materials’ bandgaps, estimated from the Tauc plots as shown Fig. S4, (ESI†) we sketch the energy-level diagrams of these samples, as shown in Fig. 3e and f. There exists a work function (WF) difference of 0.11 eV (from 4.40 to 4.51 eV) for the perovskite films without and with HRhMOP surface passivation. In addition, the value of VBM with respect to the Fermi level was increased. These results suggest that the HRhMOP-passivated perovskite surface has an enhanced n-type characteristic and this should help reduce the nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/ETL interface for an inverted PVSC.49,50 Meanwhile, the potential offset of 0.11 eV represents a larger band bending for the HRhMOP-passivated perovskite at the ETL interface that can produce a larger interfacial dipole across this corresponding interface to facilitate charge transfer.51

Fig. 3c and d displays the UPS spectra of the bilayer perovskite/PCBM and perovskite/HRhMOP:PCBM films. The onsets of secondary electron cutoff for the bilayer perovskite/PCBM and perovskite/HRhMOP:PCBM films were 16.72 and 16.81 eV, while the values of VBM with respect to the Fermi level for them were 1.55 and 1.60 eV, respectively. Similar variations for the WF/VBM values were observed for the bilayer perovskite/HRhMOP:PCBM film, suggesting the enhanced n-type behavior of the perovskite. Given these results and the asymmetric arrangement of HRhMOP in the PCBM ETL, the HRhMOP-rich region near the perovskite surface induces a downward surface potential dipole interlayer, as depicted in Fig. 3g. Accordingly, it facilitates the charge transport across the perovskite/PCBM interface and mitigates the nonradiative recombination loss. The above results clearly reveal the multi-functionality of the blended HRhMOP in the PCBM ETL that is beneficial to improving the performance of the derived PVSC.
Perovskite solar cell performance
Prior to device fabrication, we first determined and compared the steady-state photoluminescence (ss-PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the perovskite films without and with HRhMOP surface passivation and of the bilayer perovskite/PCBM and perovskite/HRhMOP:PCBM films. As displayed in Fig. 4a, the HRhMOP-passivated perovskite film exhibited an increased PL intensity with a slightly blue shift compared to the pristine perovskite film. This result confirms the passivation function of HRhMOP on the surface that reduces the charge recombination loss. The bilayer perovskite/ETL films both exhibited more blue-shifted PL peaks, resulting from the additional passivation effect exerted by PCBM. The hybrid HRhMOP:PCBM ETL exhibited a higher degree of PL quenching, suggesting a better charge collection ability across the perovskite/ETL interface.14,52 In the TRPL analysis (Fig. S5, ESI†), the carrier lifetimes are fitted by a biexponential decay model and the relevant results are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Typically, the fast decay τ1 represents the trap states or defects that induced the non-radiative recombination at the surface or within the grain boundaries, while τ2 usually stands for the intrinsic radiative recombination in the bulk film.24,53–55 By comparing the HRhMOP passivated perovskite film to the pristine perovskite film, the average τ (τavg) is increased from 346.7 to 476.3 ns. Notably, the proportion of τ1 is further reduced, indicating greater reduced defect density and suppressed non-radiative recombination. This can result from the inhibited formation of metal Pb(0) caused by HRhMOP, as evidenced by the XPS analysis (Fig. 2f).56 On the other hand, after replacing the PCBM ETL with the HRhMOP:PCBM ETL, τavg is reduced from 195.0 to 150.4 ns, implying a better electron extraction capability. We next fabricated the electron-only devices (ITO/PCBM/perovskite/PCBM or HRhMOP:PCBM/Ag) and performed the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) analyses. Their corresponding current–voltage (I–V) curves measured under dark conditions are presented in Fig. 4b and they can be divided into three regions: ohmic contact region, trap-filled limit (TFL) current region, and SCLC region. Trap density is estimated using the equation of VTFL = entL2/2εε0, where VTFL represents the trap-filled limit voltage, e is the elementary charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), nt is the trap density, L is the thickness of the perovskite layer (∼500 nm, see the cross-section SEM image in Fig. S6, ESI†), ε is the dielectric constant of the perovskite (46.9, according to FAPbI3), and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity.57 The VTFL values for the pure PCBM device and the HRhMOP:PCBM device were 0.51 and 0.25 V, and the calculated trap densities were 10.57 × 1015 and 5.18 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. Apparently, adding HRhMOP into the PCBM ETL reduces the overall trap density, and this can be attributed to its multi-functionality as discussed earlier.

(b) SCLC analyses of the electron-only devices with or without HRhMOP. (c) J–V and (d) EQE characteristics for the control and HRhMOP:PCBM devices. 
We finally examine the efficacy of the hybrid HRhMOP:PCBM ETL in the device (with a structure of ITO/PTAA/perovskite/ETL/BCP/Ag, Fig. 1a). Fig. 4c presents the resultant current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated devices. The best photovoltaic performance of each device is summarized in Table 1 and Fig. S7 (ESI†) displays the box charts of the Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE values of the studied devices. Encouragingly, the device using an HRhMOP:PCBM ETL delivered an enhanced PCE to 18.64%, outperforming the control device's performance (17.14%). The enhancement in PCE majorly stems from Voc and Jsc. The Voc value of the HRhMOP:PCBM device was increased from 1.040 to 1.061 V. This should benefit from the reduced trap density and the larger interfacial dipole across the perovskite/ETL interface as exerted by the blended HRhMOP. The Jsc value was elevated from 20.97 to 22.80 mA cm−2, which can benefit from the promoted charge transport by the hybrid ETL. Also, the reduced hysteresis observed for the HRhMOP:PCBM device suggests the greater passivation effect conferred by the HRhMOP:PCBM ETL.58,59Fig. 4d displays the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for both devices, which confirms the Jsc values obtained in the J–V characteristics and proves the superior photocurrent of the device using an HRhMOP:PCBM ETL.

Our preliminary results highlight the potential of HRhMOP for photovoltaic applications. We found that the enhanced performance is associated with the asymmetric configuration of HRhMOP in the PCBM ETL. We also blended HRhMOP into the perovskite precursor solution as an additive. However, the HRhMOP introduction seems to interrupt the crystallization and structure of the perovskite, resulting in worse performance. Meanwhile, we also attempted to utilize HRhMOP as the cathode buffer layer (at the PCBM/electrode interface) regarding its polar property; however, it did not take into effect and seem to impose an energy barrier across the interface adversely. The relevant J–V characteristics for the above cases are presented in Fig. S8, (ESI†) and the photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). In brief, we unveil that the introduction of HRhMOP into the PCBM ETL has a significant influence on the energy level alignment and interfacial electronic properties across the PCBM/perovskite interface. Besides, MOP's good affinity with various materials and high flexibility in structural design expand the potential of these materials in future PV applications.
Conclusions
In summary, we describe the potential of nanoporous metal–organic polyhedra (MOPs) for photovoltaic applications. We discover that a unique adhesion behavior exists between HRhMOP and PCBM, and its hybrid ETL possesses multi-functionality to improve the performance of the derived inverted PVSC. The BET and FTIR analyses show that HRhMOP can serve as a porous template to accommodate PCBM filling in the interstitial mesopores between packed HRhMOPs. The XPS result suggests that the hybrid HRhMOP forms an asymmetric distribution in the PCBM ETL. Moreover, the HRhMOP-rich region near the perovskite/ETL interface not only introduces a better passivation effect for the underneath perovskite film but also induces a downward surface potential dipole interlayer to facilitate the charge transport across this interface, as confirmed by the UPS and SCLC analyses. As a result, the device's performance can be improved from 17.14% (using a pristine PCBM ETL) to 18.64%, showing ∼9% enhancement. The preliminary results shown in this work will intrigue a greater interest in exploring the applications of versatile nanoporous coordination materials in the PV field.
