In particular, a certain level of humidity during the fabrication process can promote the crystallization of perovskites, resulting in better film morphologies and enhanced photovoltaic performances. Here, we unravel the importance of thermal equilibrium on the effect of relative humidity during perovskite film fabrication. We show that crystal quality is highly influenced by the dew point even when the relative humidity is unchanged. Observations related to the importance of the dew point on the material morphology, crystal quality, and resultant photovoltaic properties shed light on the dew point as a universal parameter affecting perovskite film fabrication.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic mixed halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a recent breakthrough in the field of photovoltaics. Initially, perovskite materials were primarily utilized as a light absorber in dye-sensitized solar cells.1 Since then, PSC research has focused on substituting solid-state hole-transport materials for liquid-electrolyte hole-transport materials.2 This research field has elicited significant attention because of the cost-effective processing, natural abundance, and high power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskites.3 Subsequently, advances have been made in both film deposition techniques and optimization of the photovoltaic cell configurations of PSCs.4–7 Further developments have involved increasing the valence charges of ions for a 3D perovskite structure of ABX3 (ABX3, A = an organic or inorganic cation, B = a divalent metal cation, and C = a halide anion), where a representative monovalent organic cation (methylammonium) has been replaced by or mixed with other cations such as formamidinium, cesium, or rubidium.8,9 As a result, after only 7 years of development, PCEs as high as over 22% have been reported.10
Among the most well-known factors determining device performance is the perovskite film morphology including properties such as grain size, coverage, and crystallinity.5,11–13 In particular, moisture is a double-edged sword, due to its effects on the morphology and composition during the fabrication process. In early studies, humidity was excluded from the fabrication environment, as it caused the decomposition of perovskite materials.14 In 2013, for the first time, Carnie et al. reported the manufacture of perovskite photovoltaics in an atmosphere with relative humidity (RH) < 35%; this led to a noticeable enhancement in PCE.15 In 2014, Zhou et al. highlighted that annealing perovskite films in humid air (RH around 30%) greatly improves grain size and crystallinity, resulting in enhanced electronic properties and device performances.16 Recently, studies on the role of water have been performed to determine the underlying mechanisms of these changes; they have considered not only related parameters, like the RH and use of different atmospheres (e.g., N2, O2 and air), but also various empirical routes involving H2O such as its effect on the precursors, the deposition and the annealing steps.17–20
The proposed mechanism for these effects is that the partial solubilization of perovskite materials by H2O affords greater cation mobility; this, in turn, facilitates both crystallization and coalescence of the initial perovskite crystals, reducing non-radiative trap sites at the grain boundaries.14,20 Accordingly, preparing perovskite films in a humid atmosphere has been widely shown to produce better films.10,14,21,22 The fabrication methods of perovskite films can be categorized into three representative processes: one-step, two-step, and vacuum assisted depositions. These depositions are followed by annealing the as-spun perovskite film to complete the crystallization of the perovskite or humidity-triggered crystallization without further thermal annealing.23,24 In general, adjusting the humidity level during fabrication has been used to exploit the RH values to control the effect of humidity on perovskite films.20,21,25 However, since RH is dependent on temperature, the understanding of the optimum range of RH for perovskite fabrication is still limited. This could be the cause of discrepancies in the optimum range of RH reported for the same fabrication conditions.21,25 Therefore, an invariant measure of humidity is necessary for the success of advanced perovskite fabrication systems.14
In this study, we introduce the meteorological concept of the dew point (DP) as a universal measure of the humidity of perovskite fabrication conditions. Despite the widespread awareness of the importance of humidity for improving film quality, the atmospheric thermal equilibrium during film fabrication is not well understood. The dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor, and is a measure of the absolute humidity at a given temperature.26 The DP, for a given air temperature and RH, can be calculated using the Magnus formula.26 Herein, perovskite films were deposited by a sequential method, using a PbICl precursor, in N2.27 The films were deposited on an electron transport layer (TiO2) and were annealed in a controlled atmosphere. The annealing step, which ensures systematic conditions for film formation, was performed in a glovebox equipped with atmospheric humidity and temperature controls. Parameters affecting film formation (spin program, precursor, and annealing temperature) were identical across all procedures; however, the RH was fixed at 30%, allowing only the DP to vary with atmospheric temperature.16 The chosen DPs are based on the consideration of typical laboratory temperature conditions in a range from 18 to 28 °C.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 illustrates the dependence of the DP on air temperature for different levels of relative humidity. More details on the DP under various conditions (RH and temperature) are tabulated in Table S1 (ESI†). First, the crystal structures of the films annealed at different DPs (0, 4, and 8 °C) were investigated. In the following discussion, if not mentioned, all the diffraction patterns were fitted with a split pseudo-Voigt function.28 Out-of-plane diffraction patterns of the films are shown in Fig. S1a (ESI†). The lattice parameters of the films were a = 8.8684 Å and c = 12.6836 Å at a DP of 0 °C, a = 8.8691 Å and c = 12.6466 Å at a DP of 4 °C, and a = 8.8667 Å and c = 12.6567 Å at a DP of 8 °C; they corresponded to the tetragonal I4/mcm structure of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx.19,29,30 Although the lattice parameters and peak intensities were slightly different, there were no clear differences attributable to composition effects. By measuring in-plane diffraction patterns, more detailed characterization could be performed to identify the crystal phases present in the films (see Fig. S1b, ESI†). The in-plane diffraction patterns showed the precursor complex, with 2θχ/ϕ = 11.9°, and the intermediate phase (CH3NH3PbCl3), with 2θχ/ϕ = 15.4°, at a DP of 0 °C.16,30 The results of the in-plane diffraction indicate that the transformation of perovskite materials is affected by the variation in the DP. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 2) show distinctly different perovskite morphologies and coverages depending on the DP. For the perovskite film annealed at a DP of 8 °C, a compact and pore-less film morphology, consisting of micron-sized crystal domains, is dominant; this is ascribed to a balanced sublimation process, where the rate of release of the perovskite-crystallization by-products exceeds their rate of generation.31 In order to gain insights into the crystal orientation, two-dimensional wide angle X-ray scattering (2D-WAXS) measurements were performed on the perovskite films. The films annealed at DPs of 0 °C and 4 °C exhibited the scattering ring patterns characteristic of polycrystallinity. On the other hand, the film annealed at a DP of 8 °C was polycrystalline and preferentially oriented along the c-axis (Fig. 2d); this is consistent with the highly textured perovskite crystal morphology observed at a DP of 8 °C.32 This observation suggests that the preferential orientation of perovskite crystals is promoted under specific fabrication conditions. Thus, it can be inferred that the underlying cause of the changes in the crystal orientation and morphology is the difference in thermal equilibrium during fabrication at different DPs even when RH is constant; thus, the DP is an invariant indicator that complements RH.

To further evaluate the correlation between DP conditions and photovoltaic performances, PSCs were fabricated in a FTO/c-TiO2/perovskite/poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA)/Au configuration (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b–d show the current-density–voltage (J–V) curves of the representative perovskite solar cells, alongside their performance parameters. The statistical device performances are summarized in ESI Fig. S2.† Comparing the J–V data for the photovoltaic devices, the DP during the fabrication process has a significant impact on the photovoltaic performance, especially with respect to current density (Jsc) and J–V hysteresis behavior. The trend in Jsc can be attributed to the perovskite film morphology featuring compact and perpendicularly oriented crystals at a DP of 8 °C. The main effect present in the hysteresis is a change in the fill factor (FF) of the forward scan in the devices fabricated at low DPs (0 and 4 °C); this was most prominent in the device fabricated at a DP of 0 °C. In contrast, the device fabricated at a DP of 8 °C yielded the highest PCE (19.63%) and had an open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V, a Jsc of 22.14 mA cm−2 and a FF of 77.6%; additionally, the hysteresis was noticeably suppressed. To verify these efficiencies, stabilized PCEs were measured at the maximum power point under continuous illumination of one sun.33 For the devices showing hysteresis characteristics in their J–V curves, the stabilized efficiencies were similar with averaging the forward and reverse scans. The stabilized PCE of ∼19.8% for the device with the perovskite film fabricated at a DP of 8 °C was in good agreement with the values measured from the J–V curve.

Recent studies have suggested that ion migration is a primary factor contributing to anomalous hysteresis in the J–V curves of PSCs via its influence on the band bending.34–36 Ion migration under an electric field can be accelerated through crystal imperfections, such as point defects, lattice distortion, and grain boundaries, in the perovskite films.35,37 This indicates that the coupled effects of ion migration and charge trapping at crystal defects underlie the J–V hysteresis, as has been described by others.33,34,38 Although it is believed that the perovskite films have a certain degree of defects in their microstructures due to their rapid crystallization at low temperature and non-stoichiometric solution processing,39 there has been no direct experimental evidence of this prediction;34 this is due to effects such as electron-beam damage during transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis and focused ion beam (FIB) processes, and the limited resolution of conventional X-ray diffraction (ca. 0.05°).40,41
To perform an in-depth analysis of the microstructures, we measured the rocking curves (RCs) of the (011) plane of the perovskite films; these measurements were performed on a high-resolution X-ray diffractometer (HRXRD), using a coupled 2θ/ω scan. In this san, the direction of the scattering vector, K, is fixed, and only its length is altered, as depicted in Fig. 4a. X-ray diffraction patterns of imperfect microstructures are produced by kinematic diffraction in which the diffracted X-rays travel in a direction that is, in reciprocal space, perpendicular to the sample.42 If there are changes in lattice constants (such as those caused by lattice strain), the profile of the reciprocal lattice will be affected. Thus, the d-spacing values and shapes of the RCs contain microstructural crystallographic information. Fig. 4b–d represent the RCs of the perovskite films. The d-spacing values were determined by peak deconvolution of the rocking curve profile (RCP). The calculated values of d-spacing for each perovskite film shift to slightly higher 2θ positions by around 0.5%, as the DP at which the film was fabricated reduces. This may originate from a substitution of chlorine for iodine in the plane probed.43 Moreover, considering the deconvolution of the RCP, it can be inferred that a compositional gradient leads to phase-shifted interference. Crystal inhomogeneity was, therefore, expected in the films fabricated at low DPs (0 °C and 4 °C). This implies that various degrees of crystal lattice distortion may exist between adjacent grains.39,40 The degree of imperfection in the crystal can be evaluated from the broadening of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the RCP. The FWHMs were 0.4788°, 0.4704°, and 0.1626° for the films fabricated at DPs of 0 °C, 4 °C, and 8 °C, respectively. A comparison of the FWHMs determined by peak fitting indicates that microstructural imperfections are sensitive to the fabrication environment;44 they are possibly introduced by changes in the crystallization kinetics due to differences in the thermal equilibrium of air.

In order to assess the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite films, their fluorescence decay was monitored using a time-correlated single photon counting system (TCSPC). The photoluminescence (PL) decay kinetics were analyzed using a bi-exponential function, composed of fast- and slow-decay processes.45,46 The calculated kinetic parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). Fig. 4e shows the results of the TCSPC of the films on TiO2. The introduction of a quenching layer (TiO2) causes the fast-decay component to be related to charge transport into the charge-selective extraction layer (SEL); this competes with radiative and/or trap-assisted recombination due to transfer between the bulk and the interface. Although the shortest fast-decay time (3.11 ns) was measured for the film fabricated at a DP of 0 °C, the comparatively high number of imperfections in the microstructure of the film suggests that charge transport into the SEL does not dominate charge carrier dynamics. The average decay lifetimes were 4.27 ns, 9.39 ns, and 7.45 ns for the films fabricated at DPs of 0 °C, 4 °C, and 8 °C, respectively. To compare the levels of radiative and non-radiative recombination in the perovskite films, we prepared films on glass, which has no charge-selective contact (Fig. 4f). The slow-decay components, which correlate with radiative recombination, were 12.9 ns, 21.5 ns, and 115 ns for the films fabricated at DPs of 0 °C, 4 °C, and 8 °C, respectively. This trend in radiative recombination accounts for the influence of microstructural imperfections on the charge carrier lifetime, indicating that crystal imperfections have a negative effect on charge transport dynamics.47 The non-radiative recombination time of 3 ns for the film fabricated at a DP of 0 °C supports the interpretation of the PL decay mechanism involving the SEL. Alongside the device performance and HRXRD measurements, the TCSPC measurements have allowed the direct monitoring of the optoelectronic behaviors of the perovskite films that were prepared under atmospheres with controlled thermal equilibria. Thus, controlling microstructural defects is a key for improving device performance along with the control of perovskite morphologies. This study highlights the significance of thermal equilibrium on humidity in air and better understanding of perovskite crystal growth under fabrication conditions. Further research on those factors with respect to other perovskite materials will be our next subject.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the significance of the thermal equilibrium under ambient conditions for perovskite film fabrication. The meteorological concept of the dew point was introduced as a route to manipulate relative humidity via atmospheric temperature. Perovskite films were prepared at different dew points at the same relative humidity (30%). It was shown that delicate control of the relative humidity, using the dew point, is required to exploit the effect of humidity on the perovskite films. Specifically, perovskite films with compact morphologies, micron-sized crystal domains, and highly textured polycrystallinity were fabricated at a dew point of 8 °C, leading to the highest PCE of 19.63%, and no hysteresis. We found that microstructural imperfections in the perovskite crystals are sensitive to the fabrication environment, which accounts for the dependence of photovoltaic performance on film preparation conditions. The invariant measure of the dew point provides a better understanding of the optimum range of humidity for perovskite fabrication, providing an insight into the design of advanced perovskite solar cell fabrication systems including scalable industrial production.
Experimental
Device fabrication
Etched F-doped tin oxide glass (FTO, TEC 8) was used as the substrate. The FTO glass was cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and iso-propyl alcohol (IPA), successively under sonication. A compact layer of TiO2 (c-TiO2) was deposited onto the cleaned FTO glass via spray pyrolysis at 450 °C using a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in anhydrous ethanol (1:10 volume ratio) as the precursor and with oxygen as a carrier gas. The perovskite films were deposited using a sequential deposition method. A PbICl precursor containing PbI2 (0.5 M) and PbCl2 (0.5 M) in anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) was spin-coated onto the c-TiO2 films at 5000 rpm for 30 s. To convert the PbICl films into perovskite films, MAI solution (40 mg mL−1 in anhydrous IPA) was loaded onto the PbICl film for 40 s, and then spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s under N2 (H2O < 0.1 ppm). The as-spun perovskite films were carefully transferred to an air glovebox equipped with atmospheric humidity and temperature controls and then annealed at 105 °C for 65 min (see Fig. S4†). The accuracy of the RH and temperature monitors is ±1.25% and ±0.2 °C, respectively. The range of fluctuation for the established DP was maintained within ±0.3 °C during annealing. PTAA solution was prepared at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 (in anhydrous toluene) by adding 7 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 10 μL of Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (170 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) as dopants. The PTAA solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite film at 2500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, Au was deposited onto the device via thermal evaporation to a thickness of ∼70 nm.
Characterization
The J–V curves of PSCs with a metal mask of 0.096 were measured using an electrochemical station (VSP, BioLogic) under the illumination of one sun (100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G) irradiated by a solar simulator (Sun 3000, Class AAA, ABET Technology). The illumination was calibrated using a Si reference cell. The J–V curves were scanned at a rate of 20 mV s−1. The EQE spectra were obtained using an Ivium potentiostat (Ivium) and a monochromator (Dongwoo Optron Co., Ltd) under a light support (ABET 150 W xenon lamp, AET). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films were characterized using a Cu Kα1 source (SmartLab, Rigaku). The 2D-scattering patterns were acquired using an area detector, positioned at 140 mm from the sample. The high resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) measurements were performed using a Ge (220) monochromator with a beam analyzer and the X-ray beam was carefully aligned using automatic tilting-axis alignment systems. The TCSPC was performed using a 465 nm laser (ChronosBH, ISS).
