    , Accepted 12th February 2020First published on 17th February 2020AbstractBiVO4 has been considered as a promising material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen production. To improve the charge transport performance of BiVO4 photoanodes, it is necessary to develop nanostructured BiVO4 array photoanodes. In the present study, an in situ transformation strategy (WO3 → Bi2WO6 → BiVO4) was designed and developed to fabricate a nanoporous BiVO4 nanoflake array (NFA) film. As revealed from the characterization results, the BiVO4 nanoflakes were vertically grown on FTO substrates. Note that the nanoflakes were composed of wormlike-shaped particles, thereby forming a nanoporous structure. The as-prepared films as photoanodes exhibited excellent visible-light PEC performance. Under visible light illumination, the photocurrent density of the BiVO4 NFA photoanode without a cocatalyst was 1.0 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, comparable to the reported BiVO4 array photoanode without cocatalysts. In this study, a novel and simple way was proposed to fabricate high-quality BiVO4 array photoanodes.
1. Introduction
PEC water splitting is an ideal pathway to generate H2 from solar energy for the future.1,2 Since Fujishima and Honda reported the PEC water splitting into H2 and O2 with TiO2 photoelectrodes in 1972, TiO2 nanostructure photoelectrodes have been extensively studied in the past several decades due to their non-toxicity, low-cost and high stability.3–5 However, the bandgap of TiO2 is too large (Eg ≥ 3.0 eV) to absorb visible light efficiently, as a result, causing poor solar energy utilization.6,7 Accordingly, great efforts have been made to develop visible light-responsive photoelectrode materials with a narrow bandgap (e.g., WO3,2,8–10 Fe2O3,11–14 Cu2O,15,16 and BiVO4 (ref. 17 and 18).
Among the mentioned photoelectrode materials, BiVO4 exhibiting a monoclinic structure has been considered as a promising photoelectrode material for its high theoretical solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency (9.2%) and prominent visible-light absorption (Eg ≈ 2.4 eV).19–22 Nevertheless, the reported photocurrent density of a pristine BiVO4 photoelectrode is less than 1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE on the whole,23–26 primarily due to its poor electron transportability, which leads to serious charge recombination in the BiVO4 photoelectrode. Thus, some strategies have been employed to overcome this drawback and enhance the PEC properties of BiVO4, such as using doping elements27–30 and loading cocatalysts,31–34 developing heterojunctions35–39 and designing morphology.20,26,40
The method of designing nanostructured array films as photoelectrodes has been extensively adopted to facilitate the charge transport in the photoelectrodes and enhance the PEC properties However, unlike other photoelectrode materials, few studies have been conducted on the fabrication of BiVO4 nanostructured array films thus far. Su et al. prepared BiVO4 nanowire arrays on FTO substrates using a seed-mediated growth method.41 He et al. fabricated BiVO4 NFA films with a drop-casting approach, and the synthetic films exhibited higher PEC performance than the BiVO4 nanoparticle films.40 Xiao et al. demonstrated that BiVO4 nanorod arrays were fabricated on FTO using a simple solution method; the one-dimensional nanostructure BiVO4 photoelectrode showed high light absorption and long electron lifetime.42 Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the reported BiVO4 nanostructured array films had a relatively low photocurrent density at 1.23 VRHE.
Here, an in situ transformation method (WO3 → Bi2WO6 → BiVO4) was presented for fabricating BiVO4 NFAs on FTO substrates. The results from structural analysis indicated that the WO3 NFAs could be transformed into BiVO4 NFAs with Bi2WO6 as the intermediate product following a two-step hydrothermal conversion, and the BiVO4 NFAs exhibited a porous nanostructure and high specific surface area. Note that a high photocurrent density was achieved by the optimized BiVO4 NFAs.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of WO3 NFAs on FTO
WO3 NFAs on FTO were fabricated using a solvothermal method according to previous reports.43,44 First, 0.25 g H2WO4 and 0.1 g poly(vinyl alcohol) were dissolved in 3 mL H2O2. The solution (0.2 mL) was spin-coated (2000 rpm, 18 s) on FTO and subsequently annealed at 500 °C for 2 h. A WO3 seed layer was formed on the FTO. Second, a 0.1 M H2WO4 solution was prepared with H2O and H2O2 mixture (VH2O:VH2O2 = 7:3) as the solvent. Third, the mentioned FTO was leaned against the wall of a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 mL) and with the WO3 seed layer downward. The precursor solution, consisting of 1.25 mL 12 M HCl, 5.0 mL deionized (DI) water, 10.0 mL 0.1 M H2WO4 solution, 62.5 mL acetonitrile, 0.1 g urea and 0.1 g oxalic acid, was transferred into the autoclave. The solvothermal reaction was performed at 180 °C for 2 h.
2.2. Synthesis of Bi2WO6 NFAs on FTO
The Bi2WO6 NFAs on FTO could be fabricated by a hydrothermal treatment. 0.6 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved into 30 ml 0.25 M nitric acid solution. The WO3 NFA film was leaned against the wall of the 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave with the sample side downward. The mentioned solution was poured into the autoclave. Subsequently, the hydrothermal treatment was conducted at 200 °C for 10 h. After the reaction, the formed films were annealed at 540 °C for 4 h. The relevant chemical reaction is expressed as:2Bi3+ + WO3 + 3H2O → Bi2WO6 + 6H+
2.3. Synthesis of BiVO4 NFAs on FTO
The BiVO4 NFAs on FTO were also fabricated following the hydrothermal treatment process. 4 mg NH4VO3 as the V source was fully dissolved in 30 ml DI water. Subsequently, 0.2 ml 3 M HCl was added in the NH4VO3 solution. The Bi2WO6 NFA films were also leaned against the wall of the 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave with the sample side downward. Next, the NH4VO3 solution was poured into the autoclave. Afterwards, the hydrothermal treatment was conducted at 180 °C for 4 h. After the reaction, the obtained films were annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. The relevant chemical reaction is expressed as:Bi2WO6 + 2VO3− → 2BiVO4 + WO42−
2.4. Characterization
The morphologies of the samples were ascertained under a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, MIRA3, TESCAN) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Titan G2 60-300, FEI). The crystal structures and optical properties of the samples were analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 Advance, AXS) and UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-vis, UV-2450, Shimadzu).
2.5. PEC measurement
PEC measurements were performed with an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Germany) with a 0.5 M KH2PO4 (pH ≈ 4.1) solution as the electrolyte. A Pt wire, the as-prepared sample and a Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl electrode acted as the counter, working and reference electrodes, respectively. The light source was a 500 W Xe lamp (CHF-XM, Perfectlight) with a cutoff filter (λ ≥ 400 nm). The light intensity at the photoanode position was regulated to 100 mW cm−2, as ascertained using a light power meter (PL-MW2000, Perfectlight). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted at a frequency range of 104–0.1 Hz and 1.23 VRHE. PEC hydrogen evolution experiments were performed in an H-type cell with 0.5 M KH2PO4 as an electrolyte at 1.23 VRHE under visible light illumination. The amount of evolved hydrogen was studied using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC2010) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). EAg/AgCl was converted to ERHE by the Nernst equation:45ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + EΘAg/AgClwhere EAg/AgCl and ERHE denote the potential vs. Ag/AgCl and RHE, respectively. Besides, EΘAg/AgCl = 0.1976 V at 25 °C.
3. Results and discussion
BiVO4 NFA films were fabricated following an in situ transformation strategy (WO3 → Bi2WO6 → BiVO4). Fig. 1 illustrates the transformation process. First, the WO3 NFAs on the FTO were generated using a typical hydrothermal method and subsequently converted to Bi2WO6 NFAs by intercalation of bismuth during the hydrothermal reaction. BiVO4 NFA films could be formed from the Bi2WO6 NFA films by substituting tungsten with vanadium under hydrothermal conditions. The morphological structures of WO3, Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 NFA films were ascertained by SEM (Fig. 2). WO3 exhibited ultrathin nanoflakes with an edge length of 1–1.5 μm (Fig. 2a and b). After the first transformation, the Bi2WO6 NFA films were formed and each Bi2WO6 nanoflake (NF) consisted of a lot of ultrasmall sheet-like crystals (Fig. 2c and d). BiVO4 NFA films could be formed by further transformation. Fig. 2e and f show that the BiVO4 NF was composed of wormlike-shaped particles, generating a nanoporous structure. Subsequently, the microstructure and crystal structure of the BiVO4 NF were further characterized by TEM and elemental mapping (Fig. 3). The nanoporous structure of the BiVO4 NF could be demonstrated from the LR-TEM image of the BiVO4 NF (Fig. 3a). The uniform lattice fringes (d = 0.312 nm) are presented in Fig. 3b and c, matching well with the (103) interplanar spacing of monoclinic BiVO4. Furthermore, the elemental mappings of the BiVO4 NF presented in Fig. 3d suggest that the O, V and Bi elements were distributed uniformly in the BiVO4 NF.

The crystalline phases of WO3, Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 NFA films were confirmed by XRD. Fig. 4a shows that the WO3 NFA film displays the characteristic diffraction peaks of SnO2 (JCPDS 71-0652) and WO3 (JCPDS 72-0677). The diffraction peaks of Bi2WO6 (JCPDS 73-2020 and 85-1286) can be identified in the XRD pattern of the Bi2WO6 NFA film, while the peaks of WO3 disappear, revealing that WO3 was completely turned into Bi2WO6. For the BiVO4 NFA film, besides the SnO2 diffraction peaks, all the other diffraction peaks at 19.0°, 28.6°, 28.9°, 30.6°, 35.2°, 40.0° and 50.3° are well consistent with the monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS 75-2480), suggesting that the BiVO4 film can be obtained from the WO3 film via such an in situ transformation method. The optical absorption behaviors of the WO3, Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 NFA films were assessed by UV-vis spectroscopy. According to Fig. 4b, the optical absorption behaviors of both the WO3 and Bi2WO6 NFA films were similar and their absorption edges were nearly 460 nm, complying with their bandgap energy (Eg ≈ 2.7 eV). Obviously, the optical absorption of the bare BiVO4 NFA film was considerably enhanced, and the absorption edge was approximately 520 nm, which is consistent with its bandgap energy (Eg ≈ 2.4 eV). Moreover, the UV-vis absorption results could also be supported using the photographs of the WO3, Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 NFA films (Fig. 4b inset). The WO3 NFA film displayed a similar color to the Bi2WO6 NFA film, and showed a yellow-green color, while the color of the BiVO4 NFA film was yellow.

To ascertain the PEC performance of the as-prepared films, the PEC performances of the WO3, Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 NFA photoanodes were assessed by plotting the photocurrent density–potential curves. Fig. 5a displays the photocurrent density–potential curves obtained from the WO3, Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 NFA photoanodes under visible light illumination. Fig. 5a shows that the BiVO4 NFA photoanode exhibited the maximal photocurrent density in the whole test potential range. The photocurrent density of the BiVO4 NFA photoanode at 1.23 VRHE was approximately 1.0 mA cm−2 and almost twice that of the WO3 NFA photoanode (0.49 mA cm−2). In particular, the photocurrent density of the BiVO4 NFA photoanode is comparable to the reported BiVO4 array photoanode without cocatalysts (Table 1). Moreover, the EIS results of the WO3, Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 NFA photoanodes were recorded at 1.23 VRHE under visible light illumination in the frequency range from 104–0.1 Hz. The EIS Nyquist plots of the WO3, Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 NFA photoanodes displayed only one semicircle, revealing that the charge transfer from the electrode to the electrolyte was the only limiting step in the PEC reaction. It is generally known that the charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface is related to the radius of the semicircle, and a smaller radius suggests a smaller charge transfer resistance.46 According to Fig. 5b, the semicircle diameter of the BiVO4 NFAs was smaller than those of the WO3 and Bi2WO6 NFAs, demonstrating that the charge transport resistance in the BiVO4 NFA photoanode/electrolyte interface was the smallest. The EIS results are consistent with the photocurrent density measurement. Furthermore, the charge-transfer efficiency (ηtran) and charge separation efficiency (ηsep) of the BiVO4 NFA photoanode were calculated by:21ηtran = JH2O/JNa2SO3ηsep = JNa2SO3/Jabs

According to Fig. S2,† the ηtran and ηsep of the BiVO4 NFA photoanode at 1.23 VRHE were about 66% and 38%, respectively. These low values should result from the absence of a cocatalyst on the photoanode surface and the presence of some grain boundaries in the photoanode.
To clarify the relationships between the PEC performance and the illumination wavelength, incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed at a constant potential of 1.23 VRHE (Fig. 6). The WO3 NFA photoanode exhibited a PEC response at a wavelength of ∼460 nm. After transforming into Bi2WO6, the wavelength range of the PEC activity did not significantly alter but the IPCE value reduced in the overall wavelength range. It is noteworthy that the BiVO4 NFA photoanode displayed an extended wavelength range of the PEC activity (∼520 nm) and considerable elevation in the IPCE value, complying with the results of photocurrent density and UV-vis absorbance measurements. To assess the PEC stability of the BiVO4 NFA photoanode, the photocurrent–time curve at 1.23 VRHE was measured under long-term irradiation. Fig. S2a† reveals that the photocurrent density of the BiVO4 NFA photoanode did not decline obviously after 180 min, indicating the high stability of the BiVO4 NFA photoanode. Furthermore, the amount of the evolution gases was measured at 1.23 VRHE in PEC water splitting experiments and the result is presented in Fig. S2b.† The hydrogen evolution rate of the BiVO4 NFA photoanode is about 19.4 μmol h−1 cm−2. The Faradic efficiency is calculated to be 89.6%.

To delve into the flat-band potential (Vfb) of the as-prepared photoanodes, the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots were measured at an applied frequency of 1, 2.5 and 5 kHz in a 0.5 M KH2PO4 solution under dark conditions. Both the Vfb and Nd of the photoanodes could be estimated by:47  where ε0 denotes the vacuum permittivity, ε is the dielectric constant of the electrode material, q is the electronic charge, C indicates the capacitance of the space charge region, Nd is the donor density, k is the Boltzmann constant, and VE represents the applied potential.46 The M–S plots of the WO3, Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 NFA photoanodes are shown in Fig. 7a–c. The linear plots all have a positive slope, demonstrating that the three photoanode materials are typical n-type semiconductors. The Vfb of the photoanodes can be calculated by taking the x-axis intercept of the fitted tangent line. The Vfb of the WO3, Bi2WO6 and BiVO4 NFA photoanodes is nearly −0.02 V, −0.07 V and −0.21 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. The mentioned Vfb results are close to the value reported in the literature.48 Moreover, the mechanism of the charge transfer and the PEC water splitting process of the BiVO4 NFA photoanode are illustrated in Fig. 7d. The electrons in BiVO4 could be excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) under light irradiation. The excited electrons were collected onto the FTO along the BiVO4 nanoflake pathway and further migrated to the Pt electrode via the external circuit. H+ would react with the excited electrons and produce hydrogen on the surface of the Pt electrode. Meanwhile, the holes left in the VB would move to the BiVO4 surface and react with water to generate oxygen. Accordingly, it is the nanoporous flake array structure that is able to improve the separation and transmission of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, for its high specific surface area.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel BiVO4 NFA film was fabricated by an in situ transformation strategy (WO3 → Bi2WO6 → BiVO4). The film structures were characterized by SEM, XRD and TEM. The results revealed that the BiVO4 NFAs were vertically grown on FTO substrates, and each nanoflake was composed of wormlike-shaped particles, thereby forming a nanoporous structure. The as-prepared films acted as photoanodes for PEC water splitting. The BiVO4 NFA photoanode exhibited the maximal PEC performance, and its photocurrent density at 1.23 VRHE reached 1.0 mA cm–2 without a cocatalyst under visible light illumination. The present study can develop a novel pathway to fabricate BiVO4 array photoanodes and facilitate the charge transfer of the photoanodes for PEC water splitting.
