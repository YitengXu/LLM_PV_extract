    , Accepted 3rd August 2016First published on 4th August 2016AbstractInverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells with poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrenesulfonate) sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) as the hole transport layer (HTL) have attracted significant attention during recent years. However, these devices suffer from a serious stability issue due to the acidic and hygroscopic characteristics of PEDOT:PSS. In this work, we demonstrate a room-temperature and solution-processed CuI film which is used as the HTL for inverted perovskite solar cells. As a result, an impressive PCE of 16.8% is achieved by the device based on the CuI HTL. Moreover, the unsealed CuI-based device displays enhanced air stability compared to the PEDOT:PSS-based device. In addition, the fabrication of the CuI HTL is a simple and time-saving procedure without any post-treatment, thus making it a promising candidate as the HTL in inverted perovskite solar cells and a potential target for efficient flexible and tandem solar cells.
Introduction
Over the past few years, organic/inorganic hybrid organometal trihalide perovskite based solar cells have been one of research hotspots for photovoltaic technology due to their high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and relatively simple fabrication.1–3 The advantages of perovskites, including their large absorption coefficient, broad-band absorption, low-cost, high charge carrier mobility and diffusion length, have promoted diversity in device architectures, which have evolved from dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) with a mesoscopic structure to organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with a planar heterojunction configuration.1,4–7 Among these device architectures, the perovskite solar cell in the planar structure without a mesoporous layer has attracted great attention because of its relatively higher PCE and low-temperature preparation.8–14 Currently, the most successful state-of-the-art device architecture is where the perovskite layer is sandwiched between a compact n-type metal oxide as the electron transport layer and a hole transport material (HTM) such as [2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenlamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene] (spiro-MeOTAD).15,16 Although other organic hole transport materials, such as poly-hexylthiophene (P3HT) or poly-triarylamine derivatives, have been successfully introduced into perovskite solar cells with fine efficiencies, the high cost of these organic materials limits their development for further large-scale and commercial application.17,18 In contrast with organic materials, inorganic hole transport conductors seem to be good alternatives due to their low cost, high mobility and stability. Copper iodide (CuI) and copper (CuSCN) have been employed in perovskite solar cells through a solution-processed method, yet the PCEs of perovskite solar cells based on these inorganic hole conductors are lower than that of devices based on organic hole conductors.19–21
Another inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell composed of poly(3,4-ethyl-needioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/perovskite/fullerene junction, where PEDOT:PSS and fullerene act as the transparent hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL), respectively, was reported with a remarkable PCE.22–24 However, PEDOT:PSS is not an ideal hole transport conductor owing to its inefficient electron-blocking capability, and acidic and hygroscopic nature. There have been several reports about replacing PEDOT:PSS with an NiO semiconductor because of its good transparency, appropriate energy levels and high hole transportability in inverted planar perovskite solar cells.25–28 Unfortunately, when compared with the performance of devices based on PEDOT:PSS, the PCE of NiO in perovskite solar cells is unsatisfactory due to a lower short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), in spite of an obviously improved open-circuit voltage (VOC). It could be inferred that the loss in JSC and FF is attributed to the poor electrical conductivity of the NiO film. In order to address this problem, Jen et al. fabricated planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells based on a Cu-doped NiOx film with impressive PCEs up to 15.40%.29 Seok et al. prepared a well-ordered nanostructured NiO layer via a pulsed laser deposition method and achieved an overall PCE of 17.3% for perovskite solar cells using this NiO film as HTLs.30 Recently, a heavily p-doped NixMg1−xO film was developed and used as hole selective contacts to extract hole carriers effectively in the inverted planar perovskite-PCBM film architecture. A remarkable PCE of 16.2% was obtained for the corresponding device with active area >1 cm2, along with a small hysteresis.31 Ding et al. introduced Cu2O and CuO films as HTLs in inverted perovskite solar cells via a facile solution-processed method with good stability.32 Moreover, our group employed a series of inorganic semiconductor containing copper compounds as HTLs in inverted perovskite solar cells, such as CuSCN, CuS and CuOx,33–35 and the perovskite solar cells with these copper compound semiconductors exhibited excellent device performances compared with that of devices using PEDOT:PSS. However, the relatively complicated preparation methods of inorganic HTLs, including the requirement for electro-deposition, post-deposition annealing or treatment with ultraviolet-Ozone, are not appropriate for the low-cost and high-throughput production of perovskite solar cells. There are only a few research on the utilization of pristine solution-processed inorganic HTLs in inverted perovskite solar cells. As a consequence, it is an urgent demand to discover other inorganic HTLs, which can be solution-processed and applied in perovskite solar cells immediately.
CuI, which has a wide band gap of 3.1 eV, behaves as a p-type semiconductor. We have recently reported a CuI layer prepared from a facile solution-processed method, which was successfully introduced in polymer solar cells (PSCs). The results showed that the devices based on the CuI pristine films displayed a superior performance than conventional devices using PEDOT:PSS.36 Most recently, Chen et al. employed CuI as the HTL in inverted perovskite solar cells with a PCE of 13.58%, as well as improved device stability.37 However, they selected a conventional two-step sequential deposition to prepare the perovskite films, which probably possess a high surface roughness and large interface contact resistance between the perovskite layer and CuI HTL, thus limiting the improvement of the PCE of perovskite solar cells. Herein, we design a planar inverted perovskite solar cell with a p–i–n configuration composed of ITO/CuI/CH3NH3PbI3/fullerene (C60)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag, where the CuI film as the HTL is deposited by a low-temperature and solution-processed method and the CH3NH3PbI3 film as the light absorbed layer is fabricated by a one-step fast deposition-crystallization method. We have improved the PCE of perovskite solar cells incorporated with a CuI layer by optimizing the dropping time of chlorobenzene (CB) after introducing an N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution of CH3NH3PbI3 to the surface of the CuI film. After the optimization, a maximum PCE of 16.8% for the CuI based device was obtained. Furthermore, the optimized perovskite solar cells based on the CuI HTL exhibited better air stability than conventional perovskite solar cells using PEDOT:PSS.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and b show SEM and AFM images of the top view of the CuI film on an ITO electrode prepared via the spin-coating method, respectively. After the CuI acetonitrile solution was deposited, the surface of ITO was covered with CuI nanoparticles, indicating that the CuI nanopaticles could avoid direct contact between the ITO electrode and the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. As shown in Fig. S1,† the root mean square (RMS) roughness of bare ITO was 4.7 nm, while the RMS roughness slightly increased to 6.5 nm after treatment with the CuI film. The higher RMS roughness, on the one hand, would increase the contact area between the HTL and the active layer, but on the other hand, may be harmful to the formation of a high-quality upper perovskite layer.

A one-step fast deposition-crystallization method (FDC) was reported by Spiccia et al. to form a homogeneous and dense perovskite film.38 Many factors that influence the quality of a perovskite film, including the types of additional solvent, the concentration of the perovskite solution and the dropping time of the additional solvent, were investigated in previous literature. Although the dropping time of the CB solution was limited to 4–6 s according to the original article, we propose a further study for the influence of dropping time (3.5 s, 4.5 s and 5.5 s) of the second solvent on the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskite. In order to get better understanding of the evolution of the perovskite film fabricated by the FDC technique, the morphologies of the obtained perovskite film under different dropping times of extra solvent were observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 2, the introduction of CB in 3.5 s after the start of spin-coating produced a flat and uniform CH3NH3PbI3 film, although there were some cracks between the perovskite particles due to unattainable supersaturation of the perovskite solution on the substrate. When the dropping time was delayed to 4.5 s or 5.5 s, the evaporation of the DMF solvent speeds up the concentration of the perovskite solution, resulting in the appearance of supersaturation of the CH3NH3PbI3 solution in the film. Then the CB droplets were added to the substrate, which quickly induced the fast nucleation crystallization of perovskite, leaving a high surface coverage and dense film. Additionally, the size of perovskite crystals formed when the dropping time was 5.5 s was smaller than that of the perovskite particles formed in 4.5 s, which could be explained by the attainment of a higher concentration of perovskite solution. However, when the time of adding CB droplets was extended to 6 s or later, a pink perovskite film was achieved which is similar with that obtained from the conventional method without the addition of CB, and this is ascribed to the occurrence of heterogeneous crystallization and aggregation of CH3NH3PbI3 crystals.

The device configuration of the perovskite solar cell based on the CuI HTL and the corresponding cross-sectional SEM image are shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen from Fig. 3b, the CuI buffer layer between the ITO and the CH3NH3PbI3 layer is not clearly identified due to the thin thickness of CuI. The surface of ITO (or CuI) can be covered with a smooth and uniform perovskite film with an average thickness of approximately 300 nm. Besides, the C60 electron transport layer and the hole block layer could be observed to completely coat the underlying perovskite film, which indicates that leakage paths from the perovskite layer to Ag electrode cannot occur.

A schematic energy diagram of the material in the device is presented in Fig. 3c. Ultraviolet photoelectron yield spectroscopy was used to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the different anode buffer layers and the CH3NH3PbI3 layer (Fig. S2 in the ESI†). The HOMO energy level of the CuI layer was determined to be −5.4 eV, which is a little higher than that of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer (−5.5 eV), thus leading to the benefit of extracting holes at the interface between the CuI and CH3NH3PbI3 film and collecting holes in the CuI HTL. However, the HOMO of PEDOT:PSS was measured to be −4.9 eV, which is much higher than that of CH3NH3PbI3, and would create a high energy barrier between the PEDOT:PSS HTL and CH3NH3PbI3 layer. In addition, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the CuI layer (−2.3 eV) is much higher than that of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer (−4.0 eV), which could prevent electrons from reaching the perovskite effectively. On the contrary, the electron blocking ability of PEDOT:PSS is weak, resulting in the recombination of charges in the PEDOT:PSS layer.
To further investigate the influence of morphology of the perovskite film on the performance of photovoltaic devices, solar cells with the structure of ITO/CuI/CH3NH3PbI3/C60/BCP/Ag were fabricated (where the CH3NH3PbI3 film was deposited when the dropping time of CB was 3.5 s, 4.5 s and 5.5 s, noted as Device A, Device B and Device C, respectively). For comparison, a reference cell using PEDOT:PSS as the HTL was also manufactured (noted as Device D). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the detailed photovoltaic parameters (average of 10 devices) of the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. 4a and Table 1. As listed in Table 1, Device A shows a PCE of 13.3%, Voc of 0.91 V, Jsc of 21.1 mA cm−2 and FF of 69.3%. In contrast, all of the photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE) of Device B are enhanced to 0.99 V, 22.6 mA cm−2, 71.3% and 16.0%, respectively. The reason for the increased Voc is due to the better perovskite coverage of the substrate (Fig. 2b and d), which probably decreases the possibility of leakage paths. Meanwhile, a uniform perovskite film with less defects and traps was formed in Device B, which reduces the recombination of charge carriers in the CH3NH3PbI3 film, thus leading to a higher Jsc and FF. However, as the dropping time of CB was delayed to 5.5 s, the Voc (0.97 V), Jsc (22.1 mA cm−2) and FF (70.5%) of Device C are slightly lower than that of Device B, which is ascribed to the enhanced recombination of charge carriers caused by the increased grain boundary between smaller perovskite particles. Upon insertion of PEDOT:PSS instead of the CuI layer, the parameters of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of Device D are 0.79 V, 22.9 mA cm−2, 73.1% and 13.3%, respectively. As mentioned above, the high energy barrier between the PEDOT:PSS and CH3NH3PbI3 layer could be one reason for the decreased Voc. Furthermore, another possible reason for the lower Voc is the controversial electron blocking ability of PEDOT:PSS, since PEDOT:PSS could be taken as an electron collecting electrode.

In order to evaluate the hysteresis in the J–V curves of the perovskite solar cells, we recorded the J–V curves of the best performance devices based on the CuI layer by using both the forward (from forward bias to short circuit) and reverse (from short circuit to forward bias) scan mode with a scan rate of 0.3 V s−1. As shown in Fig. 4b, the Voc, Jsc and FF obtained from the J–V curve of the reverse scan mode were 1.01 V, 22.8 mA cm−2 and 73.0%, respectively, yielding a PCE of 16.8%. Additionally, the corresponding parameters from the J–V curve of the forward scan mode were 0.97 V, 22.7 mA cm−2 and 73.8%, respectively, producing an almost similar PCE of 16.2%. Such a slight hysteresis in the CuI perovskite solar cells indicates the reliability of the J–V measurement. The incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the device, which is presented in Fig. 4c, exhibits a broad range of over 80% between 430 nm and 750 nm, of which the highest value reaches 90.5% at 490 nm. The IPCE spectrum of the device with PEDOT:PSS HTL is shown in Fig. S3.† The Jsc of the device with PEDOT:PSS, which is calculated from integrating the IPCE spectrum, is about 19 mA cm−2, which is far less than that of the device measured from the J–V curve. Since the test environment for the J–V curve and IPCE spectrum measurements is different (the J–V curve measurement was performed in a glove box whereas the IPCE spectrum measurement was conducted in air), we speculate that the instability of PEDOT:PSS may be the reason for the difference between the results of the J–V curve and the IPCE spectrum.39 To investigate the reproducibility of the performance of the inverted perovskite solar cells with the CuI HTL, 30 independent solar cells were prepared and measured. The histogram of the PCEs is presented in Fig. 4d. The distribution of the PCEs for the 30 cells is mainly concentrated in a small range from 15% to 16%, which indicates that our solution-processed CuI layer could be a potential candidate as an inorganic HTL for inverted perovskite solar cells.
As is known, the stability issue needs to be resolved for the commercial production and application of perovskite solar cells. Despite the fact that PEDOT:PSS is widely applied as a HTL in inverted perovskite solar cells with impressive PCEs, the acidic and hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS exacerbate device degradation. Accordingly, the long-term stability of the unencapsulated devices incorporating CuI or PEDOT:PSS as the HTL was monitored and recorded in air at 25% humidity and room temperature (Fig. 5). Apparently, the device based on PEDOT:PSS shows a rapid decrease in PCE after 216 h of exposure in air, which is mainly ascribed to a dramatic reduction in Jsc and FF. Whereas, the device using CuI as the HTL exhibits remarkably improved device stability and maintains more than 93% of its original PCE even after 288 h storage in air, which is due to the hydrophobic nature and superior air stability of CuI.
 Fig. 5  Stability tests for Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of unencapsulated perovskite solar cells with CuI or PEDOT:PSS HTLs as a function of exposure time to ambient atmosphere. 
In conclusion, we have fabricated a planar inverted perovskite solar cell by the incorporation of a low-temperature solution-processed pristine CuI HTL, where the perovskite layer is deposited by a FDC method. Compared with devices prepared with PEDOT:PSS HTLs, the CuI HTL inserted in the inverted perovskite solar cell exhibited a more effective reduction in energy loss at the interface between the HTL and perovskite layer, leading to improved charge extraction and inhibition of charge recombination in the HTL/perovskite interface, thus delivering an enhanced PCE. Furthermore, the highest PCE of 16.8% for the CuI based device was obtained by the optimization of the morphology of the perovskite film. It is worth noting that the CuI-based perovskite solar cell displayed more excellent air stability than that of the classic PEDOT:PSS-based perovskite solar cell. More importantly, the fabrication of the CuI HTL for inverted perovskite solar cells with a remarkable PCE is a facile and time-saving procedure without any post-treatment, indicating that CuI is a promising alternative as an HTL in inverted perovskite solar cells for low-cost and large-scale industrial production.
