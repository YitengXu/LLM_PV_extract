    First published on 30th July 2018AbstractThe past decade has witnessed tremendous research efforts devoted to two-dimensional (2D) materials and great progress made in both their fundamental studies and technique development. 2D light-emitting materials such as transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and phosphorene are receiving particular attention as a result of their intriguing electronic, optical and optoelectronic properties. The ability to tune their layer numbers, engineer their dielectric environment, form alloys, create van der Waals heterostructures, etc. provides further means to modulate their properties which have led to a number of interesting luminescence features and potential applications in lighting, imaging and sensing. As the map of 2D materials has expanded over the past few years, 2D organic and organic–inorganic hybrid materials, such as 2D polymers, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, have also emerged with merits of low cost, chemical versatility and solution processibility. Importantly, the wide tunability of their functional properties is enabled by the rational design and controlled modification of their compositions and structures at the molecular level. Herein, we present a critical review of 2D light-emitting materials by categorizing them into three main groups, namely 2D inorganic light-emitting materials, 2D organic light-emitting materials, and 2D organic–inorganic hybrid light-emitting materials. Within each group, we will describe their preparation methods and discuss their structural and chemical properties. Significant emphasis will be placed on strategies that can tune their luminescence properties, and their potential applications in various fields. Finally, we will summarize by stating the current challenges and future opportunities in the development of 2D light-emitting materials.

Introduction
The recently intensified research in two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), has been motivated by many of their phenomenal properties and the possibility to revolutionize the future electronic/optoelectronic technologies.1–6 In particular, semiconducting 2D light-emitting materials like graphene derivatives,3 TMDs6 and phosphorene2 have demonstrated a number of attractive features such as tunable band structures,2,5–10 large exciton binding energies,11,12 strong light–matter interactions6,13 and high carrier mobility,6,7,9,14 not to mention the flexibility that makes these atomic thin crystals promising for the next-generation optoelectronic devices, including optical sensors, displays, lasers, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).1–3,6 In contrast to the zero bandgap graphene, graphene derivatives such as chemically modified graphene, graphene quantum dots and graphene nanoribbons possess finite and tunable bandgaps for light-emitting purposes. The development in this research area has been reviewed in several recent publications.3,5,14 Single- to few-layer TMDs are superior to graphene derivatives and show direct and indirect bandgaps, respectively, over the visible to near-infrared range.5–9 Phosphorene, a very unique type of 2D material, possesses widely tunable direct bandgaps (0.3 and 2.0 eV for bulk and monolayer, respectively) and in-plane anisotropy which make it distinctly different from graphene and TMDs.2,10 The light-emitting properties of these materials, including photoluminescence (PL),5,15 electroluminescence (EL),5,15 thermoluminescence (TL)16 and cathodoluminescence (CL),17 can be tuned by many factors, such as substrate, temperature, electrostatic doping, strain and defect.2,5,15 Moreover, the building of heterostructures of 2D materials by vertically stacking them or laterally stitching them together provides further opportunities to overcome the limitations of constituent layers and also generate novel properties from interactions/coupling between them.18–20
Promising research on the aforementioned inorganic 2D materials further enriched the exploration of 2D organic and organic–inorganic hybrid light-emitting materials, such as organic small molecules, polymers, supramolecular polymers, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, and organic metal complexes.21–25 As newly emerged 2D materials, 2D organic and organic–inorganic hybrid light-emitting materials have exhibited controllable synthesis, easy assembly, flexible structures and excellent optical/photoelectric properties.26–28 They represent a unique class of nanomaterials that possess single- or few-atom thick sheet-like structures with the lateral size up to a few micrometers. Their 2D feature is unique and indispensable to access unprecedented chemical, physical, electronic, and optical properties over their 3D counterparts due to the electron confinement effect.29
In this review, we will firstly describe the structures and preparation methods of various semiconducting 2D inorganic light-emitting materials. Combined with the available theoretical predictions, a significant emphasis will be placed on their light-emitting properties and strategies that can tune these properties for various applications. Then, we review the recent advances in 2D organic and organic–inorganic hybrid light-emitting materials, starting with a discussion of their various synthetic methods with comments on their advantages and limitations. After introducing the characterization of their optical/optoelectronic properties, their potential use in light-emitting devices as well as in other electronic and optoelectronic applications will be reviewed. Finally, current challenges and opportunities in the development of 2D light-emitting materials will be stated.
2D inorganic light-emitting materials
1. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
Layered TMDs with the chemical formula of MX2, where M represents a transition metal (e.g., Mo and W) and X is a chalcogen (e.g., S, Se and Te), are probably one class of the most investigated inorganic 2D materials. Every TMD monolayer consists of two chalcogen planes separated by a transition metal plane.1,9 Adjacent individual layers are held together to build the corresponding 3D form via van der Waals interactions. Due to the variation in metal–chalcogen coordination and/or stacking orders between layers, different crystal polytypes exist for TMDs.30,31 Taking MoS2 as an example, it has four polytypes, that is 2H, 1T, 1T′ and 3R (Fig. 1a).31 The polytype with trigonal prismatic coordination is referred to as 2H and its single layer form is referred to as 1H, while the octahedral coordination corresponds to the 1T phase. Along the z-axis normal to the 2D plane, the atomic stacking sequence of the 2H phase is S–Mo–S (ABA) in the hexagonal symmetry, and that of the 1T phase is S–Mo–S′ (ABA′) in the tetragonal symmetry. The 1T′ phase, which is also known as the disordered 1T phase, has a similar octahedral coordination to the 1T phase. However, the 1T′ phase includes a superstructure in every layer (e.g. zigzag chain (2a × a), trimerization  and tetramerization (2a × 2a)).1,31 The 3R phase has three layers per repeat unit in the rhombohedral symmetry with trigonal prismatic coordination. The dominant phase of MoS2 is 2H due to its thermodynamic preference, and other phases will transform to 2H upon heating.32,33

1.1 Preparation methods. 
The light-emitting properties of TMDs are highly dependent on their thickness, crystallinity and phases, and therefore their controlled preparation is important for further characterization and applications. Up to now, many methods have been developed to prepare TMDs, which can be generally divided into two categories, i.e. the top-down and bottom-up approaches, as summarized in Table 1.

1.1.1 Top-down strategy. 
Analogues to graphene, single- to few-layer TMDs can be obtained by overcoming the weak van der Waals interaction between layers in the corresponding bulk crystals. The exfoliation of bulk crystals is also known as the top-down strategy, such as mechanical cleavage,34–38 liquid phase exfoliation,39,40 ion-intercalation and exfoliation,41–48 and the laser thinning technique.49,50 The mechanical cleavage method can produce high quality mono- to few-layer TMD nanosheets, but its yield is low.9,30 In contrast, the liquid phase exfoliation method, which relies on the match between the surface energy of the TMD and that of the particular solvent used, can produce TMD nanosheets/nanoplates in large scale. However, the concentration of monolayers is low.7,51 The chemical and electrochemical ion-interaction (e.g. Li+, Na+, and K+) and exfoliation (Fig. 1b),48 on the other hand, can enable massive production of single- to few-layer TMD nanosheets such as MoS2, WS2, and WSe2.32,41,42,52–54 Although the 2H-to-1T phase transition is inevitable during such processes involving Li+ ions or NH4+ ions,41,55 and causes a loss of their semiconducting properties, post-exfoliation treatment such as annealing can be carried out to revert the 1T structure back to the 2H counterpart.32,33
1.1.2 Bottom-up strategy. 
The bottom-up strategy refers to the direct synthesis of TMDs from nucleation and growth processes. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD)56–60 and wet chemical synthesis (e.g. hot injection method,61–63 one-pot method64–66 and hydro/solvothermal method67–69) have both been used to synthesize single- to multi-layer TMDs from metal and chalcogen sources. While the wet chemical syntheses usually yield assemblies of few-layer TMDs, CVD is an efficient way to generate high-quality TMDs over large areas with controllable thickness.57,62–65,67,69–71 2D TMD alloys, such as Mo1−xWxS2, MoS2(1−x)Se2x, Mo1−xWxSe2, and WS2(1−x)Se2x, can be produced as well by both CVD and wet chemical synthesis.72–79 Although CVD is one of the most popular strategies, it starts with solid sources, making it difficult to control the precursor uniformity, vapor pressure and supersaturation, thus restricting uniform growth of TMDs over large areas.80 This problem was alleviated by using metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD),81,82 which uses gas-phase precursors and has been demonstrated to produce high-quality single-/multi-layer MoS2 or WS2 (Fig. 1c and d).81 Very recently, Zhou et al. developed a molten-salt-assisted chemical vapor deposition process that can be broadly applied for the synthesis of a wide variety of TMDs.83 The salt could not only reduce the melting points of metal precursors to reduce the energy needed for the synthesis to proceed, but could also react with the metal oxides to form metal oxychlorides, which would evaporate at an appropriate temperature and facilitate the growth of TMDs (Fig. 1e).83 Remarkably, with this method, 47 compounds, including 32 binary compounds (based on the transition metals Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, Re, Pt, Pd and Fe), 13 alloys (including 11 ternary, one quaternary and one quinary), and two heterostructured compounds, were successfully prepared.
Moreover, atomic layer deposition (ALD) has also been used to prepare TMD nanosheets, whose thickness can be controlled by using different ALD cycles.84,85 In addition, ALD is capable of producing TMDs with less defects compared with other methods, and therefore 2D materials prepared from ALD are more suitable for device fabrications.86


1.2 Light-emitting properties. 
Bulk and multilayer semiconducting TMDs are indirect-bandgap semiconductors, and a transition from the indirect to direct bandgap can be achieved when the thickness of a TMD is thinned to a monolayer.6,9,15,87 The inherent direct-band gaps of monolayer TMDs with diverse compositions are in the visible to near-infrared range (∼1.1–2.5 eV).88 Besides the unique band structures, mono- to few-layer TMDs also show high carrier mobility,6,7,9 intensive Coulomb interactions11,12 and strong light–matter coupling,6,13 making them exhibit attractive light-emitting properties. In the following, the light-emitting properties of TMDs will be described in terms of photoluminescence (PL), electroluminescence (EL) and thermoluminescence (TL).
1.2.1 Photoluminescence. 
Most PL emissions from semiconducting TMDs belong to the fundamental excitonic emission, which involve neutral excitons, trions, bound excitons and/or biexcitons.87,89–91 In addition, emissions beyond the fundamental excitonic emission also exist, mostly stemming from the single photon emission.92–96
1.2.1.1 Fundamental excitonic emission. 
When a semiconductor absorbs a photon with energy more than its bandgap, an electron is excited from its valence band (VB) to conduction band (CB) and a hole is left in the CB. The recombination of the electron–hole pair, also known as the exciton, will lead to PL. Trion is a bound state of one exciton with an additional electron or hole. PL from monolayer MoS2 was firstly reported by Mak et al. and Splendiani et al. independently in 2010.87,89 The calculated band structure of MoS2 as a function of its layer number is shown in Fig. 2a. Monolayer MoS2 has a direct bandgap, which leads to a strong emission due to the direct excitonic transition (peak A) (Fig. 2b). Peak I resulting from the indirect transition was also observed and its intensity decreased with increasing thickness. In addition, splitting of the valence band maximum (VBM) appeared in the few-layer MoS2 due to the interlayer coupling and spin–orbit coupling. This splitting gave rise to the appearance of peak B, which was much weaker than peak A. Although the positions of peak A and B varied with the sample thickness, the splitting energy between peak A and B remained unchanged due to the strong spin-valley coupling that inhibited interlayer hopping at the local VB extrema near the K-points. The thickness-dependent PL and a constant energy associated with VBM splitting were also observed in other 2D TMDs, such as in WS2, WSe2 and MoTe2.97–100 Interestingly, He et al. recently demonstrated that such thickness-dependent band structures of TMDs also enabled the formation of chemically homogeneous junctions between regions with different layer thickness, such as the monolayer–bilayer MoSe2 junction and the bilayer–trilayer junction.101

Bound excitons are observed in TMDs due to the presence of surface defects. Atomic-scale point defects can be created in monolayer TMDs by plasma treatments,90,102 α-ray irradiation103 and thermal annealing in inert gases.103 For example, Chow et al. observed a new sub-bandgap emission peak (XD) in WS2 in addition to the neutral exciton (XO) and trion (XT) emission (Fig. 2c).90 An increase in XD intensity and a decrease in XO and XT intensity with elongated plasma treatment indicates the possible existence of defect-bound excitons. Defect bound exciton emission has also been reported in other TMDs, such as MoS2,103 MoSe2103 and WSe2.104
A biexciton consists of two bound electron–hole pairs, and is formed at high exciton densities.105 Each biexciton can emit two sequential photons and the latter photon shows higher energy than the former.105 Several studies have indicated the existence of biexcitons in 2D TMDs.91,105,106 You et al. compared the PL spectra of WSe2 under ultrafast pump radiation with different fluences at 50 K (Fig. 2d).91 Six emission peaks were observed in the PL spectra, where the peaks at 1.74 eV and 1.71 eV were assigned to the neutral excitons (X) and negative trions (X−), respectively. Peaks P1, P2 and P3, exhibiting sublinear fluence dependence, likely arose from the bound excitons at defect sites. Interestingly, under wide range excitation fluences, the relationship between the emission strength of peak P0 (i.e. IP0) and that of the neutral exciton (i.e. IX) can be described by a power-law relation with α = 1.39 (Fig. 2e). This indicates that the peak P0 located at 1.68 eV originates from the biexciton emission.
For 2D TMDs, excitonic effects dominate their PL emission mainly because of the strong Coulomb interactions between electrons and holes.15,107,108 The excitonic emissions in 2D TMDs have been manipulated via doping (such as substrate and solid capping,109–112 molecular adsorption/chemical functionalization,113–116 electrostatic gating107,108,117,118), bandgap engineering (such as alloying,72,73,77–79,119–124 temperature variation,117,125,126 strain engineering127–134), defect engineering90,102,103,135–142 and light–matter interaction engineering.143–151 These effects will be elaborated in detail in the following sections.

1.2.1.1.1 Doping


(a) Substrate and solid capping: It has been a widely known fact that the type of substrate influences greatly the performance of electronic/optoelectronic devices. Scheuschner et al. have investigated the substrate effect on the PL properties of mechanically exfoliated MoS2 monolayers.111 Different from a free standing monolayer MoS2 which showed strong PL emission from peak A (exciton) and peak A− (trion), only peak A− was observed in MoS2 supported on a Si/SiO2 substrate. This is due to the n-type doping effect from Si/SiO2 which induced the transition of neutral excitons to trions in MoS2. A similar doping effect was also demonstrated by using small band-gap bilayer graphene as the substrate,152 or using SiO2 and SixNy as the capping layer on TMDs.110

(b) Molecular adsorption/chemical functionalization: Besides solid surroundings, chemical functionalization enables the bidirectional control of the Fermi level and exciton/trion density of 2D TMDs and thus greatly improves the tunability of their optical and electrical properties.113,114 Mouri et al. demonstrated the doping of MoS2 monolayers with different functional molecules, such as 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) as p-type chemical dopants and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) as an n-type dopant.113 The PL intensity of MoS2, which is an intrinsic n-type semiconductor, was drastically enhanced by the p-type dopants and quenched by the n-type dopants (Fig. 3a and b). Because the reduction potential of F4TCNQ (0.84 eV vs. SHE) and TCNQ (0.46 eV vs. SHE) is more positive than the flat band potential of MoS2 (−0.13 eV vs. SHE) (Fig. 3c), they could accept electrons from MoS2, decrease the density of electrons and improve the trion-to-exciton transition. In contrast, the oxidation potential of NADH (−0.32 eV vs. SHE) is more negative than the flat band potential of MoS2 and thus could inject electrons into MoS2 and accelerate the exciton-to-trion transition. Besides, organic semiconductors, like p-type copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), have also been used to tune the PL of MoS2 through doping.153

Interestingly, Voiry et al. reported the functionalization of metallic 1T-MoS2 with organohalide reactants (e.g. 2-iodoacetamide and iodomethane) and observed strong PL emission due to electron transfer from the electron rich metallic MoS2 to the functionalized organic moieties.154 Two strong emission peaks were observed, one of which was located at ∼1.9 eV assignable to the shifted exciton emission from MoS2, and the other located at ∼1.6 eV due to the bound excitons.154
Solvent conditions and gas-phase perturbations also greatly influence the PL of 2D TMDs by doping.102,115,116,138 Mao et al. found that the emission of MoS2 nanosheets at 1.84 eV showed an obvious blue-shift in halogenated solvents and a red-shift in propylamine, which was attributed to their p-doping and n-doping effect, respectively.115 Similarly, ethanol was found to n-dope MoSe2via the interaction between the H atoms of ethanol and Se atoms under high pressure.155 As for the effect of gas molecules, the PL intensity of n-type MoS2 can be increased over 100 times by p-doping with adsorbed oxygen and/or water molecules.116

(c) Electrostatic gating: Applying electrostatic gating is probably one of the most direct means to tune between different excitonic species in TMDs.107,108,117,118 As a typical example, Ross et al. reported the evolution of PL spectra of MoSe2 under various back gate voltages ranging from −60 to 60 V.117 The PL map as a function of gate voltage in Fig. 3d clearly shows four high intensity regions corresponding to neutral excitons (X0), trions (X+ and X−) and impurity-trapped excitons (XI), respectively. As schematically shown in Fig. 3e, positively charged trions (X+) were generated in MoSe2 as negative gate voltages were applied, and the dominating excitonic species changed to neutral X0, and then to negative X− as the gate voltage increased in the positive direction.117 Electrostatic gating has also been applied to other 2D TMDs like WS2 and MoS2.107,108,118,156 Besides the doping induced transition between excitons and trions, Shang et al. found that electrostatic gating could also adjust the Fermi level of WS2 as well as its exciton binding energy, thus causing a shift in its emission wavelength.108

1.2.1.1.2 Bandgap engineering

For excitonic emissions, the emission energy is the intrinsic bandgap subtracted by exciton binding energy, and therefore bandgap engineering has been commonly applied to adjust the emission wavelength of TMDs. Up to now, a number of methods have been employed to tune the bandgaps of TMDs, through alloying/doping,72,73,77–79,119–123 variation of temperature117,125,126 and strain engineering.127–134

(a) Alloying/atomic doping: TMD alloys with tunable metal and chalcogen compositions such as MoS2(1−x)Se2x and Mo1−xWxS2 have been realized via both solid and liquid-phase preparation methods.72–79 For example, Mo1−xWxS2 (x = 0–1) was synthesized by Chen et al.72 by CVD and showed tunable bandgaps from 1.82 eV (x = 0.20) to 1.99 eV (x = 1). Similarly, monolayer MoS2(1−x)Se2x (x = 0–1) grown by Mann et al. exhibited tunable bandgaps between 1.87 eV (x = 0) and 1.55 eV (x = 1) (Fig. 4a and b).78 It can be seen that because of the requirement for a small diameter mismatch between the alloyed metals (or chalcogen atoms) (typically in the same elemental group or from neighboring ones), the window for tuning the bandgap or emission energy is quite narrow.

Different from the formation of homogeneously alloyed TMDs, low concentration atomic doping shows higher tolerance to the mismatch of atomic size. Consequently, TMDs doped with other groups of transition metals, such as Mn and Nb, and rare-earth metals, such as Er and Gd, have been reported.121,123,124,157 It is interesting to note that the partial substitution of Mo with Er atoms in MoS2 imparted the resulting material with both up-conversion (UC) and down-conversion (DC) light-emission properties (Fig. 4c–e).121 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that energy was released when Er atoms passivated the Mo vacant sites, suggesting that MoS2:Er was more stable than MoS2 with metal vacancies. Importantly, the Er doping introduced density of states (DOS) within the bandgap of MoS2, leading to energy transitions and thus NIR luminescence (i.e.4I9/2 to 4I15/2 transition for UC and 4I13/2 to 4I15/2 transition for DC)121,158 (Fig. 4f).

(b) Variation of temperature: It is well established that most semiconductors undergo a bandgap reduction with increasing temperature. This originates from the temperature-dependent dilatation/shrinkage of the crystal lattice and electron–lattice interactions,159,160 and the same trend is anticipated and observed in 2D TMDs.117,125,126 Taking MoSe2 as an example, two emission peaks, namely X for neutral excitons and X− for trions with lower energy, were observed at low temperatures.117 As the temperature increased from 15 to 295 K, both X and X− red-shifted and became broadened. The relationship between the emission energy and temperature for both peaks matched well with the modified Varshni equation. However, peak X− completely disappeared at temperatures above 170 K, which was ascribed to electrons escaping from the bound trion state due to thermal fluctuations.117

(c) Strain engineering: Strain can change the relative positions of atoms in TMDs, and thus effectively modify their electronic band structures,127,129–131,133 provided that TMDs possess good flexibility and mechanical strength to withstand the elastic deformation.30,161,162 Wang et al. applied a uniaxial tensile strain to a monolayer WS2 placed on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and observed that its emission from both the exciton (A) and trion (A−) red-shifted with increasing strain (Fig. 5a).134 Broadening of the PL peak became noticeable as the strain reached higher than 2.5%, which was explained by its direct-to-indirect bandgap transition.127,132,134 These indirect excitons led to the emergence of a new peak I (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, linearly reduced emission energy with increasing strain was observed for all three peaks (Fig. 5c).134 The same trend was observed in monolayer MoS2 as well and was supported by theoretical calculations.127,130,132 Apart from monolayers, the effects of tensile strain on multilayer TMDs were also investigated.127,129,163 For example, a bilayer MoS2 showed a red-shifted PL peak under tensile strain due to a reduction in its indirect bandgap.127 A bilayer WSe2, on the other hand, showed not only a red-shifted but also much enhanced PL emission, which was likely resulting from an unusual indirect-to-direct bandgap transition under tensile strain.163

Opposite to the aforementioned tensile strain-induced red-shift of PL peaks, Hui et al. reported that biaxial compressive strains caused a blue-shifted and enhanced PL of a trilayer MoS2 (Fig. 5d and e).129 As shown in the calculated band structures in Fig. 5f, both its conduction band minimum (CBM) and VBM shifted to higher energies with increasing strain. Because the CBM was more sensitive to strain, both direct bandgap energy (Edi) and indirect bandgap energy (Eid) increased, resulting in blue shift of the emission peaks.129
Besides directly applying tensile/compressive forces, strains can be created in TMDs by other means, such as heat treatment by taking advantage of the difference in the thermal coefficient between the substrate and TMDs164 or by creating one-dimensional wrinkled structures.165–167

1.2.1.1.3 Defect passivation/reparation

Defect sites in TMDs can induce bound exciton emissions, but on the negative side, they also introduce mid-gap states or non-radiative recombination centers to quench PL emissions.168 Consequently, considering the large specific surface area of TMD nanosheets and the accompanied high defect density, their PL quantum yield (QY) is generally low.137,139–141 This obstacle can be overcome by passivation/reparation of surface defects.139–141,169 For example, Amani et al. treated mechanically exfoliated MoS2 with bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide (TFSI),139 after which the PL intensity of MoS2 showed a 190-fold increase with a high QY of more than 95% (Fig. 6a). Such a spatially uniform enhancement (Fig. 6b and c) originated from the considerable reduction of the sulfur vacancies on MoS2 and thus from the removal of defect-mediated non-radiative recombination centers.139 In another attempt, Han et al. partly removed the impurities (Se(0) and SeO2) in MoSe2 by treating it with hydrobromic acid (HBr), and achieved an enhanced PL intensity by a factor of 30.140 In addition to the aforementioned acid-based chemical treatments, a moderate surface passivator, i.e. methanol, was recently employed by Neupane et al. to remove the defects via removal of the oxygen-related impurities.170

Despite the advantages of using passivation layers to enhance the light emission property of TMDs, most molecular-based passivation suffers from instability due to environmental perturbations. Kim et al. therefore developed a two-step encapsulation and passivation procedure to enhance and stabilize the PL of MoS2.171 Briefly, a MoS2 monolayer was firstly encapsulated by an amorphous fluoropolymer, i.e. perfluoro (1-butenyl vinyl ether) homocyclopolymer (CYTOP), and then treated with TFSI, which could diffuse through the CYTOP layer to reach the surface of MoS2 and passivate the defects. The PL emission in this two-step treated MoS2 showed high stability and maintained a QY of more than 89% after various post-processing treatments.171

1.2.1.1.4 Light–matter interaction

The light-emitting properties of TMDs are not only tunable by modification of their intrinsic optical, electronic and chemical properties, but also tailorable through engineering of the light–matter interaction by coupling TMDs with photonic crystal cavities (PhCC)149,151,172,173 and surface-plasmon resonance (SPR) systems.143–151,174–177 For example, Butun et al. demonstrated PL enhancement of large-area monolayer MoS2 by coupling it with plasmonic silver (Ag) nanodisk arrays.147 This enhancement was largely attributed to the fact that localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) could couple with both the excitation and emission fields of MoS2 and improve the light–matter interaction at the nanoscale.147 Importantly, the diameter of the Ag nanodisks was optimized at 130 nm to give a strong LSPR at 680 nm, leading to 12 times enhanced PL emission of the MoS2 film at 680 nm.147 It is worth noting that the TMD nanosheet and the plasmonic structures should be kept apart at a sufficient distance to avoid quenching,178 and recent studies have experimentally shown that a spacer of ∼1 nm and above is needed.150,179,180
In addition to plasmonic structures, monolayer TMDs have been combined with PhCC structures as well to realize strong coupling between excitons and cavity photons.149,151,172,173 As a typical example, after integrating a monolayer MoS2 onto a PhCC slab (silicon nitride) (Fig. 6d), Zhang et al. realized up to ∼1300 times PL enhancement in MoS2via the simultaneous Fano resonances.172 Importantly, the originally highly dispersive PL emission in MoS2 could be tuned uni-directionally at a narrow divergence angle of 5° (Fig. 6e) by overlapping the PL peak of MoS2 with the Fano resonance peaks of PhCC at ∼650 nm.172
1.2.1.2 Single photon emission. 
As mentioned above, defects in 2D TMDs often act as carrier trap centers; however, isolated defects in TMDs could act as sources for single photon emission.92–96 Koperski et al. studied the single photon emission in WSe2 monolayers on Si/SiO2 by examination of their micro-photoluminescence (μPL) at low temperatures.92 They found that in addition to the typical emission peaks for WSe2,91,98,181 specific spots located at the edges of a WSe2 flake exhibited a series of sharp emission lines at 1.61–1.68 eV with narrow linewidths down to 100 μeV, which were assigned to the single photon emissions. A similar phenomenon was observed in multilayer WSe2 by the same group.92 Interestingly, by electron beam irradiation and annealing, isolated defects could be generated in the otherwise insulating h-BN nanosheets to enable single photon emissions.182–187
1.2.2 Electroluminescence. 
Conventionally, EL can be realized via construction of p–n junctions, at which under applied bias, electrons and holes recombine to release energy in the form of photons.188–201 For a homogeneous 2D semiconductor, p- and n-doped regions can be created respectively by applying gate voltages with opposite signs. As demonstrated by Ross et al., p- and n-doped regions in a WSe2 monolayer were created by electrostatic doping (e.g. applying Vg1 = −Vg2 = +8 V) with h-BN working as the gate dielectric (Fig. 7a).188 These two doped regions were separated by an undoped area, where injected electrons and holes recombined to emit light under an applied current of as low as 5 nA at 300 K (Fig. 7b and c). This EL emission possessed an energy similar to that of the typical PL emission of undoped monolayer WSe2 (Fig. 7b), indicating that the injected electrons and holes formed excitons (including neutral and charged excitons as well as bound excitons) due to the strong Coulomb interaction.188

1.2.3 Thermoluminescence. 
Given the low thermal conductivity and high thermal power dissipation of TMDs, electrons in TMDs can be heated up due to Joule heating and emit light, which is termed as thermoluminescence (TL).16,202 Dobusch et al. fabricated an FET with a monolayer MoS2 as the channel, which was suspended over a trench with a width of 150 nm (Fig. 7d and e). When the FET was “on” and the gate voltage was higher than the threshold voltage, electrons in MoS2 were heated up to as high as ∼1500–1600 K in the suspended region, and a red emission was observed whose intensity increased with a more negative VDS (Fig. 7f and g).16 Despite the fact that localized TL emission may pose problems with respect to the performance and reliability of electronic devices, it was suggested that a narrow-band gap TMD, such as ZrSe2, could be utilized especially for efficient mid-infrared narrowband emission.

2. Phosphorene

2.1 Preparation methods. 
Phosphorene, mono- or few-layer black phosphorus (BP) with an intrinsic direct bandgap, has emerged recently as a new member of 2D materials.2,10,88,203–205 Each phosphorene monolayer is composed of a puckered honeycomb structure, in which one P atom bonds with the other three (Fig. 8a–c).1,203,206 Like other layered 2D materials bound by weak van der Waals interactions, phosphorene can also be prepared through solid or liquid-phase exfoliation methods (e.g. sticky-tape method203,207–209 and sonication210–213). Other methods such as oxygen plasma etching214 and electrochemical exfoliation of phosphorene have also been reported.215–217

Copyright 2017, American Chemical Society. (d) Spectral response range of the band gaps of various types of 2D materials.2 Reproduced from ref. 2. Copyright 2016, American Chemical Society. 
The key obstacle to using phosphorene for practical applications is its poor stability under ambient conditions.209,218–220 Post-exfoliation treatments have thus been used to improve its stability, such as atomic doping (e.g. Cu,221 K,222 As,223 Se224) and hybridizing it with other functional materials (e.g. graphene and its derivatives,225,226 TMDs,227,228 noble metals,229–231 polymers232,233 organic molecules,234–238 h-BN,214,239–242 and metal oxides243–245).


2.2 Light emitting properties. 
Unlike TMDs which undergo indirect-to-direct bandgap transitions with decreasing thickness, phosphorene exhibits layer-dependent direct bandgaps that are tunable from the visible to mid-infrared (MIR) regime. This falls right between the emission spectra of graphene and TMDs (Fig. 8d),2 thus making phosphorene particularly attractive for optoelectronic applications. Up to now, the study of the light emitting properties of phosphorene has been mostly on photoluminescence. In the following, tuning the PL emission of phosphorene via thickness control,219 electrostatic doping,214,246 dielectric environment engineering,214,246,247 temperature control,247 strain engineering247–249 and controlled oxidation214,250,251 will be discussed.
2.2.1 Anisotropic exciton emissions. 
In sharp contrast to graphene and TMDs, whose in-plane lattice structure reveals a six-fold symmetry, the in-plane lattice of phosphorene is highly anisotropic. This anisotropicity results in a strong light adsorption along its armchair direction (x) and almost no adsorption along the zigzag direction (y).252,253 In a recent report, Wang et al. aligned the excitation and detection polarization either along the x or y direction, and obtained four different PL spectra that showed the same peak profile but very different intensities (Fig. 9a). The highest intensity was obtained when the excitation and detection polarizations were both along the x direction. The intensity was reduced to less than 3% when both excitation and detection polarizations were turned to the y direction (Fig. 9b), further indicating the anisotropic adsorption and emission properties. In addition to phosphorene, anisotropic optical properties have also been discovered recently in other 2D materials, such as SnSe,254 GeS/GeSe,255 SnS,256 and ReSe2.257
 Fig. 9  (a) Polarization-resolved PL spectra, revealing the excitonic nature of emission from the monolayer black phosphorus. The excitation 532 nm laser is linearly polarized along either x (grey curves) or y (blue curves) direction. On the detection side, a half-wave plate and linear polarizer select x- or y-polarized components of the emitted light, leading to a total of four different combinations as shown. (b) PL peak intensity as a function of polarization detection angle for excitation laser polarized along x (grey), 45° (magenta) and y (blue) directions. The excitation laser power remains constant. The PL emission along the y direction is always less than 3% of that in the x direction, regardless of the excitation light polarization angle. The solid lines represent fitted curves using a cos2θ function (θ denotes the angle between the x axis and the polarization detection angle).252 Reproduced from ref. 252.

2.2.2 Thickness controlled PL. 
The bandgap of phosphorene is highly thickness-dependent as suggested by both experimental investigations and theoretical predictions.209,218,219,253,258 While the bandgap of a monolayer phosphorene is ∼2 eV, that of bulk BP is ∼0.3 eV.203 Similar to TMDs, the PL emission of phosphorene is dominantly contributed by excitonic species, i.e. excitons and trions, and its emission energy, also termed as the optical bandgap, Eopt, is the intrinsic bandgap subtracted by the exciton binding energy. Recently, Zhang et al. found that the exciton binding energy of few-layer phosphorene placed on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) increased from 106 to 213 meV as its thickness decreased from 6 to 2 layers, and by extrapolation of this scaling trend, a large binding energy of ∼800 meV was obtained for monolayer phosphorene.259 Despite the increased binding energy with thickness reduction, the bandgap increases to a larger extent. Consequently, phosphorene exhibited a pronounced blue-shift in its emission peak from ∼1500 to 750 nm, as its layer number decreased from 5 to 1 (Fig. 9c and d).219 This indicates that compared to TMDs, phosphorene offers a wider tunability in emission energy by thickness control.
2.2.3 Electrostatic doping. 
As mentioned in the section for TMDs, electrostatic gating is an efficient way to tune between the different types of excitons and has also been recently applied to phosphorene.214,246 Xu et al. applied various back gate voltages ranging from −50 to 50 V on a trilayer phosphorene (Fig. 10a),246 and found that at a gate voltage of −50 V, holes were injected into phosphorene and the positive trion emission located at ∼1300 nm was very strong. As the voltage became more positive, some of the positive trions lost holes to become neutral excitons that resulted in an increased emission at ∼1100 nm.246 Interestingly, even when the voltage was increased to as high as +50 V, emission from negative trions was not observed, which was attributed to the intrinsic p-type behavior of phosphorene. Importantly, the authors also observed a high trion binding energy of ∼162 meV (energy difference between excitons and trions) in phosphorene (Fig. 10b), which was observed previously only in one-dimensional (1D) materials (for example carbon nanotubes).246 This quasi-1D property of exciton species in a 2D matrix is expected to offer opportunities for the study of quasi-1D many-body interactions in 2D materials.

2.2.4 Dielectric environment. 
It was recently found that phosphorene with the same layer number showed different PL emission when placed on SiO2 substrates with different compositions.207,209,218,219,252 This can be attributed to the highly dielectric environment-dependent exciton binding energy of phosphorene,209,212 which decreases as the dielectric constant of the substrate increases, thus leading to increased emission energy.247 For example, the PL emission of phosphorene blue-shifted as its substrate was changed from Si/SiO2 to Si (Fig. 10c).247
2.2.5 Temperature control. 
Unlike many semiconductors, which showed thermal-induced bandgap shrinkage and red-shift in PL emission,117,125,126,159 bulk BP exhibited a blue shifted emission with increasing temperature due to lattice expansion and renormalization of its bandgap via electron–phonon interactions.260,261 Recently, a similar property was reported by Surrente et al.247 in monolayer phosphorene. As shown in Fig. 10d, the PL emission from neutral excitons located at 1.9–2.1 eV exhibited an obvious blue shift as temperature increased (Fig. 10e).261 Together with this blue shift, a reduction in the peak intensity at higher temperatures was also observed (Fig. 10f), attributable to the thermal-induced quenching via non-radiative recombination.247
2.2.6 Surface oxidation. 
Oxidation of phosphorene creates a high density of surface defects,214,250,251 and based on the first-principles calculations, defects could introduce additional energy levels to produce photon emissions.262 Pei et al. and Gan et al. experimentally proved this prediction by subjecting phosphorene to oxygen plasma treatment and electrochemical oxidation, respectively.214,263 Especially, the oxygen plasma treatment which produces various active oxygen species could enable controlled oxidation in phosphorene.214 Over-etched phosphorene nanosheets with both the horizontal bridge and diagonal bridge oxygen defects could be prepared (Fig. 11a and b), leading to two strong PL peaks located at 780 nm (P1) and 915 nm (P2), respectively (Fig. 11c). These two peaks were absent in the spectra of as-exfoliated and mildly oxidized phosphorene nanosheets, further confirming their assignment to the defect bound excitons.214 In addition, since these two peaks were broad, other defects like interstitial oxygen, dangling oxygen, physisorbed oxygen and water might also cause the emission.214,262 Moreover, these two peaks showed increased intensity when the gate voltage was gradually changed from 50 to −50 V (Fig. 11d). This indicates that in contrast to the pristine monolayer phosphorene which is a p-type semiconductor, phosphorene with oxygen defects showed n-type behavior.214

(e) PL spectra of monolayer phosphorene on PECVD oxide/Au and thermal oxide/Si substrates were measured. The measured PL spectra from the substrate background are also plotted for comparison. The peaks from free excitons are labelled as A peak, which is at ≈720 nm for the thermal oxide/Si substrate and at ≈700 nm for the PECVD oxide/Au substrate. The second low-energy PL peak at ≈920 nm from monolayer phosphorene on PECVD oxide is labeled as X peak. (f) A free exciton in monolayer phosphorene diffusively moves along the armchair axis, converts to a 0D-like exciton at the local state and emits brighter PL than quasi-1D excitons.250 Reproduced from ref. 250. Copyright 2016, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 
In another interesting work, Xu et al. observed a new strong peak (∼920 nm) from monolayer phosphorene placed on a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) oxide/Au substrate compared to that on a thermal oxide/Si substrate (Fig. 11e).250 This is because the PECVD oxide/Au substrate carried abundant dangling oxygen bonds on its surface that could bind to phosphorene to generate oxygen defects. These defects acted as 0D-like localized excitons (Fig. 11f), whose emission showed a 33.6 times larger QY than that of the intrinsic excitons in phosphorene.250 The thermal stability of such interfacially localized excitons was investigated by Sharma et al., who placed a trilayer phosphorene on a PECVD oxide/Au substrate. The relationship between the emission intensity and temperature was fitted with the decay equation and revealed that the activation energy of the localized excitons was ∼77 meV, which is smaller than the trapping potential (∼130 meV), indicating the high thermal stability of these oxygen defect induced excitons.251
Furthermore, the controlled oxidation of phosphorene also enables bandgap tuning, as based on theoretical predictions, the bandgap of phosphorene oxide (P4On) broadens as the oxygen concentration increases.262,264 Lu et al. experimentally demonstrated that the PL emission energy of P4On could be tuned from ∼1.77 to ∼3.76 eV by controlling the laser oxidation process.265 This tunability provides more opportunities for exploration of phosphorene and its derivatives for photonic and optoelectronic applications.

3. 2D heterostructures
Since a substantial improvement of the mobility and carrier inhomogeneity of graphene was achieved by stacking it on the top of an h-BN flake instead of SiO2, heterostructures based on 2D materials have attracted a great deal of attention.7,18,19 Construction of 2D heterostructures not only provides opportunities to overcome the intrinsic limitations of individual 2D materials, but also creates new properties by rational design and controlled fabrication.18,20,266–269 More importantly, these novel heterostructures offer new opportunities to study the physics and chemistry of reduced dimensional systems. Over the past few years, a number of heterostructures based on 2D materials have been explored, including vertical heterostructures such as WSe2/MoS2,269,270 MoSe2/WSe2,270–276 MoS2/WS2271,277–281 GaSe/MoSe2,282 phosphorene/BN,283 phosphorene/MoS2,284 graphene/BN,18,285 MoS2/graphene,286 MoSe2/graphene,287 and InSe/graphene,288 and lateral heterostructures such as MoSe2/WSe2,270,289 MoS2/WS2,281 MoS2/MoSe2,267 and WS2/WSe2.267

3.1 Preparation methods. 
Up to now, various strategies have been developed to prepare 2D heterostructures, which are mainly based on the manual stacking of exfoliated/CVD-grown 2D materials13,18,266,268,269,271,276,284,285,290–301 and the direct CVD or physical vapor transport (PVT).267,270,280–282,286,289 The layer-by-layer stacking method was firstly demonstrated by Dean et al.,18 in which a vertical graphene/h-BN heterostructure was constructed by using mechanically exfoliated graphene and h-BN layers. CVD-grown 2D materials can also be transferred from their growth substrate to a target surface and stacked together. As described by Hong et al.,290 a single-layer MoS2 grown by CVD on SiO2/Si was coated by poly-(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and then the substrate was removed by etching. The obtained PMMA/MoS2 film was allowed to float in water before being scooped up and transferred on the top of a CVD-grown WS2. The final MoS2/WS2 vertical heterostructure was obtained by dissolving the PMMA layer in acetone followed by annealing in vacuum. Such a typical transfer process with the assistance of a sacrificial polymer layer has been applied to prepare diverse kinds of vertical heterostructures (e.g. graphene/MoS2,268 MoS2/BP284 and h-BN/WS2285). As for the direct CVD growth of heterostructures, sequential deposition of different 2D materials is usually carried out, such as in the two-step CVD growth of WSe2/MoSe2 heterostructures,270 and GaSe/MoSe2 heterostructures even with a large lattice misfit of ∼13%.282 Markedly, Gong et al. successfully demonstrated the one-step controlled preparation of vertical or lateral WS2/MoS2 heterostructures by tuning the CVD growth temperature.281 As schematically shown in Fig. 12a, sulphur powder, molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) and tungsten (W) powder were placed separately in a quartz tube, and the W powder was scattered with tellurium (Te) to improve the melting of W and suppress the formation of bulk WS2 particles. With the same experimental setup, vertical WS2/MoS2 heterostructures were synthesized at ∼850 °C (Fig. 12b–e) as a thermodynamic product, while lateral WS2/MoS2 heterostructures were obtained at ∼650 °C as a kinetic product (Fig. 12f–i). Instead of using metal salt and chalcogen as precursors for CVD, PVT has also been applied to prepare heterostructures, such as lateral MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructures by using WSe2 and MoSe2 powder as precursors.289

3.2 Light emitting properties. 
3.2.1 Photoluminescence. 
Up to now, the study of luminescence properties of 2D material-based heterostructures has been mainly on TMD-based type-II heterostructures, in which, besides the emission from intralayer excitons (discussed in Section 1.2.1.1), additional PL peaks due to interlayer excitons have also been observed, such as in WS2/MoS2,281 WSe2/MoS2,270 WSe2/MoSe2,274,275 and MoS2/MoSe2.298
3.2.1.1 Interlayer excitons. 
In one of the pioneering works, Fang et al. prepared vertical WSe2/MoS2 heterostructures via manual stacking, and found a new PL peak emerging at lower energy in addition to the intrinsic peaks of WSe2 and MoS2 (Fig. 13a).269 This peak was assigned to the interlayer indirect bandgap transition.302–304 More specifically, due to the band offset, photoexcited electrons relaxed to the conduction band edge of MoS2 and holes to the valence band edge of WSe2, which formed interlayer excitons due to the Coulomb attraction (Fig. 13b).269 The interlayer coupling could be suppressed by inserting an h-BN layer between WSe2 and MoS2 nanosheets. It is obvious that the emission from the interlayer excitons decreased and that from the intralayer excitons of constituent WSe2 and MoS2 nanosheets increased with increasing h-BN layer thickness (Fig. 13c and d).269 Similarly, Rivera et al. reported the observation of interlayer excitons in a MoSe2/WSe2 bilayer heterostructure276 with a lifetime of ∼1.8 ns, which is an order of magnitude longer than that of intralayer excitons in constituent monolayers. Unlike the aforementioned two examples, in which the interlayer excitonic emission was due to the indirect bandgap transition, a vertical WS2/MoS2 heterostructure reported by Gong et al. showed a strong interlayer excitonic emission arising from the direct transition between the conduction band edge of MoS2 and the valence band edge of WS2.281

Copyright 2016, American Chemical Society. 
The reason that both direct and indirect transitions have been observed in these systems is because TMDs are multivalley semiconductors in which both intra- and inter-valley excitons are generated under light excitation.305 Interlayer interactions in such heterostructures can cause shifts in the energies of the VBM and CBM. As a result, optical transitions involving Γ, Σ and Q valleys other than from K and K′ are also possible.303,306,307 For example, both direct K–K and indirect Σ–K interlayer excitons in WSe2/MoSe2 vertical heterostructures were reported by Miller et al., and showed long lifetimes of several tens of nano-seconds up to 100 ns.306 In a recent report by Okada et al.,308 a vertical WS2/MoS2 heterostructure was encapsulated between two h-BN flakes. Low-energy PL peaks at 1.3–1.7 eV were observed and decomposed into three distinct peaks. Based on both detailed PL measurements and theoretical calculations, these three peaks were attributed to the direct K–K interlayer excitons, indirect Q−Γ interlayer excitons, and indirect K−Γ interlayer excitons, respectively.
In addition to neutral excitons, charged interlayer excitons have also been found to exist in light-excited TMD heterostructures.277,309,310 For example, Deilmann and Thygesen investigated the complete set of interlayer excitations in a MoS2/WS2 heterostructure using a novel ab initio method and predicted the existence of bound interlayer trions below the neutral interlayer excitons.277 Bellus et al. experimentally demonstrated that, in a WS2/MoSe2 vertical heterostructure, negative trions could be generated by combining excitons excited in WS2 and electrons transferred from MoSe2, leading to a new PL emission in addition to that of unstacked WS2 or MoSe2.309 Interestingly, Kim and coworkers recently found that the charge transfer between stacked monolayers of MoSe2 and MoS2 converted the polarity of trions in MoSe2 from negative to positive, resulting in the presence of positive trions in MoSe2 and negative trions in MoS2 (Fig. 13e).310 The emission from the direct band transition in MoSe2 was much enhanced in the heterobilayer (Fig. 13f) due to the reduced charge transfer from MoSe2 to the neighboring MoS2. This enhancement could be further increased by inserting an h-BN single-layer between the MoSe2 and MoS2 nanosheets to further suppress charge transfer between them.
As mentioned, rapid charge transfer in photoexcited TMD-based heterostructures269,282,290,293,294,298,311 not only assists in the formation of interlayer excitons, but also causes considerable quenching of intralayer excitonic emissions, such as in WSe2/MoS2,269 WS2/MoS2,281 WSe2/MoSe2,270 MoS2/MoSe2,298 MoS2/BP,294 WS2/BP,294 WS2/graphene152 and GaSe/MoSe2.282 However, Yuan et al. observed quenching of intralayer excitonic emission from only WS2 and not MoS2 in a WS2/MoS2 heterostructure.294 The authors ascribed this phenomenon to the direct to indirect bandgap transition in WS2, while the direct band gap exciton in MoS2 was unaffected.
3.2.1.2 Stacking angles. 
The interlayer excitonic emission of TMD heterostructures has also been found to be highly dependent on stacking angles.307,312,313 It was suggested that the interlayer emission was the strongest for coherent stacking with the high-symmetry interface (i.e. 0 or 60° rotated) and largely suppressed for random stacking at intermediate rotating angles (10–50°).307,312,313 As reported by Heo et al., the coherently stacked MoS2/WS2 bilayers showed a direct-bandgap at the K-point, while the randomly stacked counterpart (e.g. rotated at 21.79°) featured an indirect-bandgap for interlayer transition (Fig. 14a and b).307 In the randomly stacked configuration, the weak coupling of orbitals between MoS2 and WS2 (Fig. 14c and d) could inhibit charge transfer between them,312,314,315 and therefore the interlayer exciton emission at 1.4–1.7 eV was suppressed (compare the yellow and green curves in Fig. 14e).307 Such angle-dependency of the interlayer exciton emission has also been attributed to the interlayer distance which affects the interlayer coupling strength and thus the charge transfer efficiency.312,314,315

The lower figures show the band structure of coherent and random MoS2/WS2 bilayers. The rotation between two monolayers is 21.79° in the random structure.

3.2.1.3 Strain engineering. 
As mentioned in Section 1.2.1.1.2(c), strain can modify the bandgaps and emission energies of TMDs.127,132,134,316,317 Pak et al. investigated the evolution of the band structure of MoS2/WS2 vertical epitaxial heterostructures using in situ strain PL measurements.279 Red shifts and blue shifts of the PL peaks with increasing tensile and compressive strain, respectively, were observed for PL emissions from both MoS2 and WS2. In addition, the emission intensity ratio of WS2 to MoS2 was found to increase under tensile strain and decrease under compressive strain. This observation was attributed to the different modes of strain induced band structure change of WS2 and MoS2.127,132,134,316,317 More specifically, under tensile strain, MoS2 underwent a direct-to-indirect transition and WS2 experienced a reduction in its direct bandgap, and vice versa. However, the effect of strain on the interlayer exciton, which is very important in understanding the effect of strain on the interlayer coupling, has not been studied so far.
3.2.1.4 Interface at lateral heterostructures. 
Apart from the vertical heterostructures, the PL properties of 2D lateral heterostructures have also been investigated.281,289,318 Gong et al. found a new and enhanced PL emission at the interface of a lateral WS2/MoS2 heterostructure (Fig. 15a and b).281 The interface was suggested as an enhanced excitonic recombination center, where excitons from the nearby region would preferentially recombine.281 Based on theoretical calculations, this preferential recombination could be caused by a strong built-in electric field at the interface, which broke the coherence of the excitons generated nearby. Similar PL enhancement was also reported in a lateral MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure by Huang and coworkers, who attributed this enhancement to the defect-trapped excitons or enhanced radiative recombination at the interface.289
 Fig. 15  (a) PL measured from the points marked by 1–5 in the inset. MoS2 located at the center of the lateral WS2/MoS2 heterostructure, while WS2 located at the edges. The peak positions of spectra 1 and 5 are 630 nm and 680 nm, corresponding to pure WS2 and MoS2. The PL peak shifted with the change of distance to the interface (points 2 and 4). A strong and broad peak was noted at the interface (point 3). (b) PL microscope image of the triangular WS2/MoS2 heterostructure. This image exhibited strong localized PL enhancement at the interface. The inset represents the corresponding intensity profile along the dashed line.281 Reproduced from ref. 281.

3.2.2 Electroluminescence. 
As mentioned in Section 1.2.2, EL can be realized by creating lateral p–n junctions in a homogeneous TMD nanosheet via electrostatic gating.188–190,192 However, such laterally configured devices usually suffer from long distance and time for charge diffusion.188–190,192,299 Vertical stacking of p- and n-type 2D materials is an alternative for the creation of p–n junctions, which might overcome the limitation mentioned above.299 Cheng et al. reported EL from vertical p-type monolayer (ML) WSe2/n-type few-layer (FL) MoS2 and p-type bilayer (BL) WSe2/n-type FL MoS2 heterostructures.299 A series of peaks were identified in the spectra, including excitonic peaks A (∼792 nm) and B (∼626 nm), hot electron luminescence (HEL) peaks A′ (∼546 nm) and B′ (∼483 nm) and an indirect band gap emission peak I (∼880 nm). As expected, both direct exciton emission peak A and indirect exciton emission peak I were observed in BL-WSe2, while only peak A was observed for ML-WSe2. The unexpected emissions of HEL peaks in both types of heterostructures were attributed to the electric field induced carrier redistribution.299
3.2.3 Cathodoluminescence. 
In addition to PL and EL, light emission can also be induced by a high-energy electron beam, termed as cathodoluminescence (CL).17 CL has been found to be weak in TMD monolayers due to the atomic-thin cross section for electron–hole creation. Additionally, since the spatial distribution of e-beam excited excitons at the interface assembles a sphere, most recombination happens in the supporting substrate rather than in the 2D material.17 Interestingly, Zheng and coworkers found that the CL emission from a monolayer MX2 (i.e. MoS2, WS2 or WSe2) was greatly enhanced when it was sandwiched between two h-BN layers.17 For example, Fig. 16a schematically shows an h-BN/WSe2/h-BN heterostructure under e-beam irradiation. Given the fact that h-BN possesses micrometer-range diffusion lengths for electrons and holes,319 electron–hole pairs generated in h-BN could diffuse into the WSe2 monolayer before recombination (Fig. 16b).17 Therefore, with further thickened h-BN capping layers, an increased amount of electrons and holes generated in h-BN could diffuse to WSe2 and then recombine there, leading to significantly enhanced CL emission (Fig. 16c and d).17

4. Applications of 2D inorganic light-emitting materials
Up to now, substantial research attention has been paid to 2D materials like TMDs and phosphorene. Researchers have found a broad range of applications such as in electronics, energy conversion and energy storage devices, which have been reviewed recently.1,9,30,204 In the following paragraphs, we particularly focus on their advantages as light-emitting materials in LEDs,188–201,320 lasers321–325 and bioimaging.326
For example, Yang et al. demonstrated that a large-area CVD-WS2 film was transferred and sandwiched between p-type Si and n-type ITO to form a p-i-n heterojunction, where electrons and holes from Si and ITO were injected into WS2, respectively, and recombined radiatively to emit red light at ∼635 nm.201 In addition to the conventional p–n junctions, LEDs can also be constructed based on vertical metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) heterostructure devices.285,301,327 For example, Withers et al. stacked graphene, h-BN and MoS2 together to construct a vertical heterostructure (Fig. 17a).285 In such a configuration, two graphene layers, which acted as the transparent electrodes, were separated by an h-BN/MoS2/h-BN sandwich quantum well (QW). Under external bias applied across the graphene layers, electrons and holes tunnel through the h-BN layers to reach MoS2 (Fig. 17b). Especially, when the thickness of the h-BN flake was more than one atomic layer, the lifetime of the carriers could be sufficiently prolonged for the formation of excitons, which subsequently recombined to give efficient light emission (Fig. 17c and d).285 In addition, the low temperature external quantum efficiency (EQE) of a single h-BN/MoS2/h-BN QW was only ∼1%.285 This could be improved by stacking multiple QWs together, which could provide the injected carriers with additional chances to recombine radiatively. Evidently, the EQE of a device with four QWs reached ∼8.4%. Moreover, the EL emission in MIS heterostructures can be further enhanced by integrating them with PhCCs.327 Liu et al. combined a graphene/h-BN/WSe2/h-BN/graphene heterostructure with PhCC, and found that its EL emission was enhanced more than 4 times. Such an enhancement was attributed to the strong coupling between the PhCC mode and exciton EL in WSe2, leading to an increased emission rate.327 Moreover, single defects can be utilized in MIS heterostructures for electrically driven single photon emitters with narrow emission lines.295–297

(f) PL spectrum collected at the sample center.325 Reproduced from ref. 325. Copyright 2017, Nature Publishing Group. 
Recently, 2D TMDs have also been used to generate laser by coupling them with PhCC.321–325 For example, Wu et al. used a monolayer WSe2 as a gain medium at the surface of a pre-fabricated PhCC, and achieved laser emission at 739.7 nm with a low pumping threshold of 27 nW.321 However, this device functioned at low operating temperatures (e.g. 130 K). Room-temperature lasing was later realized by Salehzadeh et al., who placed a multilayer MoS2 between a free-standing microdisk and microsphere.323 Unfortunately, the power threshold for this device was relatively high (∼5 μW). Very recently, Shang et al. achieved room-temperature lasing with ultralow pumping power (∼5 nW) by embedding a monolayer WS2 in a vertical cavity constructed from 12.5 (or 8.5) pairs of quarter-wavelength-thick SiO2/TiO2 layers at the bottom (or top) as distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) (Fig. 17e). The DBRs ensured a reflectivity higher than 99% for the top layer and 98% for the bottom, together with the coupling effect from the PhCC resonance at ∼636.5 nm, leading to the highly efficient room-temperature lasing at ∼636.3 nm under 532 nm laser excitation (Fig. 17f).325
The application of TMDs in cellular labeling and imaging has also been demonstrated recently. Yeh et al. have studied the interactions between living cells and WS2,326 and noticed that LHM (ATCC, CRL-2117) cells could digest WS2 during culturing and thus obtain the fluorescence ability. Moreover, their progeny cells generated by cell division could also emit fluorescence for cellular labeling and bioimaging.326
2D organic light-emitting materials
1. 2D organic small molecules (OSMs)

1.1 Preparation methods. 
2D inorganic light-emitting materials have shown their merits of relatively high PL efficiency and tunable light emission. As a group of newly emerging 2D materials, 2D organic light-emitting materials have exhibited controllable synthesis, easy assembly, flexibility and excellent photoelectric properties.331 A typical example is 2D organic small molecules, with conjugated heterocyclic and various chromophores in general, whose structure is easy to adjust by adding unsaturated groups, such as olefin bonds, benzene, etc.331 Moreover, the compound photoelectric properties can be tuned easily by introducing different chromophores to change the degree of conjugation. 2D small molecules show remarkable self-organizing behavior due to their dynamic and reversible non-covalent bonding interactions332 (e.g. π–π stacking, hydrogen-bond, and van der Waals interactions). The currently developed strategy for preparation of 2D organic small molecules mainly involves chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which enables thickness controlled fabrication of films ranging from monomolecular layers to a few nanometers thick.1 Moreover, large-scale 2D organic small molecules have attracted extensive research attention for their potential application in photovoltaics.333–335 Three strategies have been developed for preparing large-scale 2D organic molecule films, including the self-assembly guided strategy, alignment of crystalline domains, and molecular epitaxy.328–330 Comparison amongst these strategies is shown in Table 2 and Fig. 18.

1.2 Properties and applications. 
Although many different types of self-supporting 2D organic small molecules have been synthesized, their applications are still at an early stage and these materials are mainly used for organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and photodetectors.328,330,336–341 Nevertheless, due to their wide material selection, excellent mechanical flexibility, and roll-to-roll manufacturing capability over 2D inorganic materials, many researchers are committed to the synthesis, performance and device fabrication of 2D organic small molecules. Jiang et al. firstly reported a millimeter scale 1,4-bis((50-hexyl-2,20-bithiophen-5-yl)ethynyl)benzene (HTEB) organic single crystal FET down to monolayer thickness. Film thickness was controlled from monolayer (3.5 nm) up to 21 layers using the solution cast-assembly method.328 All crystals had an atomically flat surface with a root mean square roughness of 0.3 nm, indicating the perfect film quality. The FET device was then completed by “stamping” Au stripes as top contacts. The maximum field-effect mobility was 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the on/off ratio reached 107. One of the major advantages of 2D OFETs is their great potential for sensor applications. Meng et al. demonstrated a solution-sheared approach (Fig. 19a) to fabricate large-area, ultrathin and continuous films of HTEB for high-performance OFETs (Fig. 19b), based on which highly sensitive, highly selective and reversible gas sensors were obtained and exhibited outstanding response to NH3, with a detection limit of as low as 100 ppb.336Fig. 19c shows the response of the sensor as a function of NH3 concentration. Owing to the ultrathin OFET channel, sensitivity can reach 40% for 0.1 ppm NH3. The output current also varies sharply when turning on and off the NH3 source, indicating fast response and recovery. By contrast, the sensitivity of the OFET continuously decreases with an increasing number of HTEB molecular layers (Fig. 19d). Recently, He et al. demonstrated that high-quality few-layer 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (C8-BTBT) molecular crystals could be grown on a graphene or boron nitride substrate via van der Waals epitaxy for a vertical FET device (Fig. 19e). The device showed a record-high carrier mobility up to 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an aggressively scaled saturation voltage of ∼1 V (Fig. 19f and g). The work unveiled an exciting new class of 2D small molecular materials for electronic and optoelectronic applications. For the application of photodetectors, Wu et al. demonstrated a simple p–n junction based on the 2D 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (PTCDA) photoactive layer and C8-BTBT hole-transporting and electron-blocking layer to minimize the direct tunneling effects (Fig. 19h).334 The built-in electric field dissociated the exciton in PTCDA with holes transporting through C8-BTBT layers to Au and electrons to graphene. A 514 nm laser was used to illuminate the exposed area of 2D PTCDA/C8-BTBT and prominent photovoltaic responses with an open-circuit voltage of ∼0.5 V and a photoresponsivity of ∼0.37 mA W−1 (Fig. 19i) were observed.

2. 2D polymers

2.1 Preparation methods. 
Graphene is well-known as a 2D polymer due to its structural diversity and various applications.1 In recent years, a great deal of research on 2D polymers has been developed, exploring a wide range of preparation methods.346–350 In order to prepare large-area, uniform, and long-range ordered 2D polymers, many strategies have been reported,342–345 generally divided into four categories: cross-linking of monomers on solid substrates, interface polymerization, intercalative polymerization within crystalline layered host materials, and exfoliation of synthetic layered crystals. The crystalline base metals such as Ag, Cu and Au are widely used to synthesize monolayers of 2D polymers. Not only do they act as catalysts to activate chemical bonds, but they also serve as templates for confining the polymerization process to a 2D geometry.342 The liquid/air interface, especially water/air, provides a potentially more promising alternative for the preparation of 2D polymers at a macroscopic scale compared to the synthesis of large areas of high quality 2D polymers on solid substrates. The water surface has more inherent advantages than solid substrates. For example, the amorphous nature of water avoids lattice mismatch, the surface roughness of water is low (root mean square of about 3) and the monomer is better anchored on fluid media. Besides, diffusion offers the possibility of defect repair.343 The premise of exfoliation is the synthesis of high-quality large-scale 2D polymer crystals. In view of the difficulty of obtaining a 2D polymer, the monomers can be prearranged into bulk crystals that undergo solid state polymerization to produce high quality crystalline polymers. Then, the bulk polymer crystals are separated into individual molecular monolayers using solvent or mechanical force.345 Detailed comparison of these approaches is shown in Table 3 and Fig. 20.

2.2 Properties and applications. 
Due to their film-forming ability and mechanical flexibility, polymer semiconductors are widely recognized as promising materials for large area flexible electronic devices.342,345,348,351,352 However, many of the limitations of the current polymer electronic applications, including OFETs and solar cells, are attributed to the lack of macroscopic orderliness in polymer films and the uncontrolled morphology at the nanoscale. The discovery that graphene is a typical 2D sheet in sound organic synthesis of sp2-hybrid carbon has inspired interesting π-conjugated 2D polymers that are expected to provide greater composition, topography, and flexibility of physical properties compared with graphene. Compared to devices based on organic amorphous thin films, 2D polymers have a higher molecular ordering, which is promising for improving performance, and even unique optical and electronic properties.353 To date, some small 2D polymer fragments with periodic repeating units in the lateral direction and single or few layers of 2D molecular networks have been successfully prepared. From a monolayer point of view, these structures almost meet the structural criteria of graphene and they are currently classified as 2D polymers. 2D polymers have made a lot of progress in optoelectronic applications in recent years.339,354–359 However, their investigation still has two challenges in the application of the device: (i) the irreversible feature of covalent bonds causes difficulty in forming long order thin films, (ii) the interlayer interactions are too strong to form individual layers or several layers due to the powerful π–π interactions between large π systems in 2D covalent organic frameworks.
More recently, Peng et al. realized centimeter-scale monolayer single crystalline poly(methyl methacrylate) (C10-DNTT) films with the aid of the dual solution-shearing process (Fig. 21a and b).339 The high quality monolayer OFET reached a field-effect mobility of 10.4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is among the highest reported for this material. The monolayer crystal based OFETs could detect NH3 concentrations as low as 10 ppb (Fig. 21c). The decent sensitivity indicated that the monolayer crystals were potential candidates for sensor applications. In addition to the gas phase, 2D OFETs can also be used to detect chemical species in the liquid phase. The monolayer OFET made by core-cladding liquid-crystalline pentathiophene (2R5T2R) had shown the ability to detect melamine in an aqueous solution with an ultrahigh sensitivity of 10 ppb and a response time of about 2 s (Fig. 21d and e).359 The melamine molecules acted as acceptors and eventually left holes in the semiconductor (Fig. 21f), whose sensitivity is among the highest of OFET-based sensors. In contrast, OFETs made of the corresponding bulk material have three orders of magnitude less sensitivity. The superior sensing performance introduced by the ultra-thin conductive channels demonstrates the promise of 2D OFETs in chemical, medical, biological and environmental sensor applications. Most importantly, Zhai et al. fabricated 2D distributed feedback (DFB) polymer lasers by direct writing through UV laser interference ablation (Fig. 21g–i).352 The excellent performance of the directly written polymer lasers implied the success of the new fabrication technique based on single-shot interference ablation.

3. 2D supramolecular polymers

3.1 Preparation methods. 
Recent studies have shown that 2D supramolecular organic framework materials with periodic and ordered structures similar to 2D polymers21 can also be formed by suitable non-covalent reactions and supramolecular engineering.360–368 2D supramolecular design principles based on various non-covalent interactions including hydrogen bonding,360 metal coordination, π–π stacking, van der Waals forces, electrostatic interaction, and their combinations369 are discussed in this section in detail. Due to the special structure of these materials and their ability for reaching molecular-scale dimensions, they have attracted a great deal of attention in sensing, molecular separation, and environmental protection applications.343,370–372
Dimerization is a common method for building robust 2D supramolecular polymers.21,373 In recent years, cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) has been considered as a supramolecular macrocycle that can be used to stabilize aromatic dimers in aqueous phases, and it is also used to form linear, cross-linked or hyperbranched polymers. Robust 2D supramolecular polymers based on CB[8] can be constructed by dimerization. However, the structural order of 2D supramolecular polymers prepared in this way is indefinite due to the lack of backbone. Inspired by the synthesis of 2D covalent framework materials,374 Zhang et al. synthesized honeycomb 2D supramolecular polymers made of CB[8] and a three-armed (4,4′-bipyridin-1-ium) stacking-forbidden 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene compound by a liquid-phase self-assembly method (Fig. 22a).371 The molecules were periodically arranged in the monolayer. The periodic honeycomb 2D framework was proved by 1H NMR spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction and scattering, scanning probe and electron microscope techniques. In the early years, Eck and co-workers fabricated sensors by self-assembly of biphenyl molecules to form 2D planar supramolecular nanosheets (Fig. 22b).375 The monolayer non-cross-linked portions were washed away with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) while the cross-linked sheets remained on the surface for controlled preparation of individual, independent nanosheets with a single biphenyl molecule thickness.

Coordination self-assembly building on metal ions is another popular method for the construction of 2D supramolecular polymers.364 Very recently, Schlüter and colleagues reported the fabrication of free-standing monolayer organometallic nanosheets consisting of hexafunctional terpyridine (TPY)-based D6h-symmetric monomers (coordinated ions could be Co2+, Ru2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ni2+, Fe2+) (Fig. 22c).376 Tetsuya Kambe et al. synthesized π-conjugated nanosheets comprising nickel bis(dithiolene) units (Fig. 22d),377 which were achieved through a coordination reaction between benzenehexathiol (BHT) and nickel(II) acetate [Ni(OAc)2]. BHT acts as a multichelating ligand extending in the equilateral-triangular direction. Metalladithiolene chemistry has revealed that d8 metal ions of group 10 prefer the square-planar coordination mode.


3.2 Properties and applications. 
Xu et al. assembled a novel water-soluble 2D supramolecular organic framework (SOF) with parallelogram-shaped pore structure using CB[8] and tetraphenyl ethane (TPE) modules (Fig. 23a).368 Thanks to the framework of the TPE module and its sturdy 2D polymeric structure, the 2D SOF formed by complexing with CB[8] had strong fluorescence properties (Fig. 23b). Due to the flaky structure of the 2D SOF material, the fluorescence could be more aggregated, and thus the fluorescence emission was further enhanced in water–THF at different water/THF ratios (Fig. 23c). The study showed that the unique structure of organic 2D materials is very promising in the preparation of optical materials.

Similar to 2D polymers, 2D supramolecular polymers have good applications in the fields of photoelectric sensing, information storage, and fluorescence enhancement.343,368,375,378 So far, most of the 2D supramolecular polymers have been prepared by self-assembly. To avoid any 3D growth of the coordination network during polymerization, the monomers are confined in a 2D geometry by dispersing them on the air/water interface of a Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) cell prior to polymerization.343 Lin and co-workers378 were committed to the synthesis of ultrathin semiconducting spirocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (SAH) nanosheets (Fig. 24a and b). The molecular design of spiro[fluorene-9,7′-dibenzo[c,h]acridine]-5′-one (SFDBAO) could be used to fine-tune the growth rate of crystals. Large planar aromatic π–π stacking bonds with strong supramolecules have been introduced to the 9′ position of SFDBAO. Then Py-SFDBAO could be self-assembled into ultra-thin 2D organic semiconductor nanosheets (OSNs). Its suspension was used as a prototype aqueous organic nano-ink for the fabrication of organic devices (Fig. 24c). After the OSNs were added, the information retention time of the prepared screw-type memory device reached 104 s. The stability of the device was also good, and the on/off ratio was up to 6.0 × 104 with an on/off gain of 102–103 (Fig. 24d). Aqueous dispersions of OSNs will be potential candidates for promoting green and eco-friendly organic nano-inks. Feng and co-workers prepared a separate 2D supramolecular polymer (2DSP) monolayer sheet (thickness of 0.7–0.9 nm) by using the Langmuir–Blodgett method.343 The 2DSPs exhibited excellent electrocatalysis activity in water with a Tafel slope of 80.5 mV decade−1 and an overpotential of 333 mV (10 mA cm−2) (Fig. 24e and f), superior to recently reported carbon nanotube-loaded molecular catalysts and heteroatom doped graphene catalyst. This work is promising for the development of new self-supporting organic 2D materials for energy technologies.

4. 2D covalent-organic frameworks (COFs)

4.1 Preparation methods. 
In addition to the above mentioned 2D supramolecular polymers, covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), which are covalent crystalline polymers with an ordered framework structure and nanopores, have been extensively explored.374 According to the dimensions of the building blocks, 2D and 3D COFs can be constructed. In 2D COF materials, the covalent network unit is structured by stacking single layer nanosheets, thus forming a layered structure.21,382,383 While single-layer COFs are bonded by strong covalent bonds, individual multi-layers are stacked by van der Waals forces.384–388 2D COFs have huge porosity and specific surface area, extremely low density, and good thermodynamic stability. The reversibility of dynamic covalent reactions, diversity of building blocks, and geometry retention are three key factors for the synthesis and design of COFs. To obtain a crystalline and ordered COF, two requirements are needed: (i) the formation of the COF requires monomers, oligomers, and polymers, and (ii) the building blocks should be conformationally rigid and the covalent bond formation direction must be individually separated and distinct. To meet these needs for successful synthesis of COFs, several reversible reactions and various molecular building blocks with rigid conformation have been explored (Fig. 25a).374 A majority of the reported 2D COFs were prepared via boron chemistry. Other typical classes of 2D COFs include covalent triazine based frameworks (CTFs) prepared by cyclical trimerization of monomers containing cyano groups and Schiff-base type COFs which contain imine or hydrazone linkages (Fig. 25b).

Currently, most of the 2D COFs have been prepared through solvothermal reactions, microwave synthesis, ionothermal preparation, and templated synthesis on 2D substrates (Fig. 26).379–381,389–393 The first three methods, namely bulky synthesis, can only produce solid powders, which cannot be reliably interfaced to electrodes or incorporated into real devices (Fig. 26a and b). Consequently, the synthesis of 2D COFs on surfaces has recently gained much attention. These novel materials are built by sublimation of appropriate monomers onto metallic substrates under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions and subsequent annealing. Many other studies investigated the formation of covalent structures from smaller building blocks and demonstrated the importance of the substrate both for the confinement of molecular motion in 2D and as a catalyst for activation (Fig. 26c). In addition, exfoliation of COFs into few-layer 2D COFs has recently attracted considerable attention since it may provide a direct route for scalable production of free-standing few-layered 2D polymers under mild conditions, e.g., in solutions (Fig. 26d).381 Exfoliation can reduce the crystallization of COFs, and it has been concluded that dioxane, H2O, and DMF are excellent solvents for exfoliation (i.e., exfoliating solvents), while THF, CHCl3, PhMe, and MeOH are poor solvents (i.e., non-exfoliating solvents).

4.2 Properties and applications. 
Dong and co-workers reported the preparation of all-carbon, π-conjugated 2D COF nanosheets,383 named NUS-24, and then introduced tetraphenylethylene (TPE) molecular rotors into NUS-24 for fluorescence adjustment. The free-standing ultrathin NUS-24 nanosheets were obtained by liquid exfoliation of its bulk powder (Fig. 27a). The fluorescence emission of nanosheets had also blue-shifted by about 15 nm compared to that of bulk powder (Fig. 27b). Moreover, the nanosheets exhibited stronger fluorescence emission at 77 K compared to that at room temperature (Fig. 27c). Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) tests showed that the average size of these nanosheets was 529 nm in acetone, 404 nm in acetonitrile, and 657 nm in ethanol based on the Stokes–Einstein equation (Fig. 27d). It could be observed that the fluorescence increased gradually with the mixtures of acetone and water with different water fractions (fw) (Fig. 27e). The result clearly showed the importance of the dynamic TPE rotor exposed on the nanosheet surface for improving the sensitivity of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics. Experiments were carried out by immersing the NUS-24 nanosheets in various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of different molecular sizes, and then photoluminescence tests were performed. As expected, NUS-24 nanosheets exhibited open fluorescence after being soaked in VOCs, and there was a rough positive correlation between the emission intensity of NUS-24 nanosheets and the molecular size of VOCs. For example, NUS-24 nanoplatelets exhibited yellow emission in acetone and the emission intensity increased with the molecular size of VOC analytes including dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, n-hexane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene and 1,4-diisopropylbenzene (Fig. 27f).

Due to the strong covalently linked light elements, COFs have a low mass density and high thermal stability, and provide permanent porosity, which leads to excellent applications in chemical sensing,387 energy storage,394,395 photocatalysis,396 solar cells,397 gas adsorption,23,398–400 and FETs.385 In 2D COFs, the covalent bond frameworks are confined to 2D sheets and further stacked to form a lamellar overlapping structure that presents periodically aligned columns. This columnar stacked structure provides a unique method of constructing an ordered π-system that is difficult to be formed by conventional covalent and/or non-covalent methods. The ordered columns in these 2D COFs can facilitate the transport of charge carriers in the stacking direction, which means that 2D COFs have potential in the development of new π-electron and opto-functional materials for optoelectronic and photovoltaics.
Dong et al. introduced TPE molecular rotors into NUS-24 for fluorescence-based chemical sensing.383 Significantly, the ultrathin 2D nanosheets and their composite films had higher sensitivity and selectivity to Fe3+ ions and nitro compounds, indicating their potential applications in explosive detection and environmental monitoring (Fig. 28a–c). In addition, Gobinda Das et al. previously also studied the application of 2D COFs in chemical sensing.401 They successfully synthesized two new imide-based crystalline, porous, and chemically stable 2D COFs (TpBDH and TfpBDH) employing the solvothermal crystallization route. Furthermore, thin layered COFs were derived from these bulk COFs by the solvent exfoliation method. These 2D nanosheets showed increasing luminescence intensity compared to their bulk counterparts. They also showed a “turn-off” detection in the dispersion state and presented a new approach to develop effective fluorescence chemo-sensors that enabled spectroscopy detection of nitro-aromatics with very low [10−5 (M)] analyte concentrations (Fig. 28d and e).

Apart from the application of chemical sensing, 2D COFs also show excellent performance in energy storage.389 Liu and co-workers synthesized millimeter-size crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with a clear lamellar structure,402 which was exfoliated into micrometer-size few-layer nanosheets via both micro-mechanical cleavage and liquid sonication. The obtained CTFs showed a unique staggered AB stacking with a dominant pore size of ≈0.6 nm, which was different from the common eclipsed AA stacking in various covalent organic frameworks. When explored as new polymeric anodes for sodium-ion batteries, both crystalline bulk CTFs and exfoliated nanosheets exhibited very high capacities (225 and 262 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, respectively), impressive rate capabilities (67 and 119 mA h g−1 at 5.0 A g−1, respectively) and excellent cycling stability (95% capacity retention after 1200 cycles) (Fig. 28f). Due to their strong conjugated porous structure, they surpassed most organic/polymeric sodium ion battery anodes ever reported. In summary, 2D COFs have promising applications in the field of optoelectronics.374,381,392,393,406

2D organic–inorganic hybrid light-emitting materials
1. 2D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites

1.1 Preparation methods and chemical properties. 
Due to the particularity of the perovskite structure, it can be divided into the general 2D perovskites and special 2D perovskites.27,407 The macroscopic manifestations of the special 2D perovskites, which are different from traditional definition of 2D materials, are not limited to the 2D geometric structure. Due to the special 2D perovskite structure, the electrons or holes are limited in the natural quantum wells by the quantum size effect and can only be expressed in 2D (on the plane of the film growth direction) at the nanoscale (1 to 100 nm). Their movement in the third dimension (usually normal to the film growth direction) is restricted to form a quantum well structure, which highly limits the movement of electrons.28 The general formula for the special 2D perovskite structure is L2(AMX3)n−1MX4, where n is the number of MX6 perovskite layers in the two organic insulating layers (cation L),408–411 and A, M, X, and L are divalent metal cations (Sn2+, Pb2+), halogen anions (Cl−, Br−, I−), long chain organic cations and short chain organic and inorganic cations (CH3NH3+, HC(NH2)2+, Cs+), respectively. When n = 1, the formula is L2MX4, where a single inorganic layer of MX6 octahedra is sandwiched between layers of long-chain organic cations. The inorganic perovskite layer and long-chain organic cations are alternately arranged to form such a layered structure. The electronic motion is limited to a single layer of inorganic perovskite plane, which is also a typical 2D perovskite. When n ≥ 2, each inorganic layer becomes thicker, containing few- to multi-layers of MX6 octahedra stacked together. The general 2D perovskites refer to perovskite materials that have a 2D geometry on the crystal structure and a larger planar and thinner thickness, such as micro- and nanosheets.407,412,413 By controlling the reaction conditions and limiting the growth rate of the different crystal planes, the orientation growth of different crystal planes of the perovskite can be achieved. To further control the thickness of the perovskite, a large number of small-sized 2D perovskite materials can be obtained.
The current strategies for the fabrication of 2D perovskite nanosheets include ultrasound exfoliation, wet-chemical methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD),27,413,414 and solution-based colloidal synthesis. The shape and thickness of 2D structures formed by the exfoliation method are not uniform, while wet chemical methods utilize solvent crystallization, but only on the substrate (Fig. 29a).403 These disadvantages all affect the function and application of 2D perovskites. The solution-based colloidal synthesis method offers several advantages, including cost efficiency, stability, and solution processability. Moreover, colloidal synthesis25,404,410 allows the growth of free-standing, organically capped nanosheets with precisely controlled thicknesses and potentially large lateral sizes. Such a layered structure allows possible exfoliation of single- or few-layer thick 2D sheets of L2MX4 from the bulk counterpart. Indeed, the successful growth of the atomically thin 2D hybrid perovskite of BA2PbBr4 (BA = C4H9NH2, n-butylammonium) with single- and few-layer thickness has recently been reported.403,409,411,415,416 Recently, Letian Dou and co-workers reported the solution phase growth of single and several unit thickness 2D (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4 single crystals with a well-defined square shape and large size (Fig. 29b).25 In addition to the successful synthesis of 2D L2MX4 structured perovskite nanosheets, Sudhir Kumar and co-workers demonstrated colloidal 2D formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) hybrid perovskites (Fig. 29c)404 and Liu synthesized 2D hybrid CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) nanocrystals as thin as a single unit cell (∼1.3 nm) (Fig. 29d and e).405

1.2 Properties and applications. 
It has been demonstrated that the perovskite material has the advantages of high PL quantum efficiency, significant bipolar transport, better carrier mobility, and adjustable color range in the visible band. Dou and co-workers revealed that high-quality 2D perovskite crystals exhibited high efficiency photoluminescence and tunable emission by changing the nanosheet thickness (Fig. 30a), temperature (Fig. 30b) and the composition of halogen (Fig. 30c).25 Simultaneously, Bao et al. indicated that the PL peak gradually shifts to a shorter wavelength when the perovskite thickness is reduced (Fig. 30d).405 For a single cell thickness perovskite, the PL peak is around 720 nm which is significantly lower than that of 3D perovskites (∼770 nm). The PL emission shift of ultra-thin 2D perovskite flakes may be caused by lattice expansion; that is, structural relaxation of the in-plane lattice increases the optical bandgap. Recently, Zhang and coworkers reported the facile synthesis of single- and few-layer free-standing phenylethylammonium lead halide perovskite NSs, (PEA)2PbX4 (PEA = C8H9NH3, X = Cl, Br, I).416 Importantly, these ultrathin 2D perovskite NSs exhibited highly efficient and tunable photoluminescence, as well as superior stability (Fig. 30e and f).

The 2D perovskites combine the outstanding properties of 2D materials and perovskite materials with the former's solution processability, molecular-scale self-assembly, and excellent film-forming properties, while retaining the latter's strong luminescence properties, higher quantum yield, and better color purity.27,412 The application of 2D perovskite materials, therefore, in LEDs,419,420 lasers, photodetectors, field effect transistors (FETs), and solar cells28,414 has been intensively reported.29,404,408,409,418,420,421 Liu et al. used BN as a buffer layer to grow a 2D MAPbI3 (∼1.3 nm) nano-disk array on a Si/SiO2 substrate to prepare a photodetector (Fig. 31a).405 Under the different laser intensity at 405 nm, the photo-current–time curve of the device showed a significant difference, confirming the effectiveness of the material as a light-controlled switch. At 1 V bias, the response rated at 405 nm and 532 nm was about 22 A W−1 and 12 A W−1 (Fig. 31b), respectively, which is better than that of the photodetector based on 3D perovskites. Sudhir Kumar and co-workers demonstrated ultra-pure green EL based on the colloidal 2D FAPbBr3 hybrid perovskites (Fig. 31c).404 Meanwhile, 2D Ruddlesden–Popper layered perovskites show improved moisture and light stability over 3D perovskites. Henry J. Snaith et al. introduced the n-butylammonium cation into the mixed cation lead mixed halide FA0.83Cs0.17Pb (IyBr1−y)3 3D perovskite to form 2D perovskite platelets.417 The formation of 2D perovskite platelets interspersed between highly oriented 3D perovskite grains inhibited non-radiative charge recombination. The optimal ammonium content for solar cells showed an average stable power conversion efficiency of 17.5 ± 1.3% with the 1.61 eV bandgap perovskite and 15.8 ± 0.8% with the 1.72 eV bandgap perovskite (Fig. 31d). The stability under simulated sunlight was also enhanced. Cells remain 80% “aged” for 1000 hours in air and can reach 4000 hours after encapsulation (Fig. 31e). In addition, Li et al. prepared MAPbI3 nanosheets with a controlled thickness and a smooth outer surface (Fig. 31f) with excellent laser application. When used in fast pulsed fiber lasers, the MAPbI3 nanosheets produced ultra-fast picosecond laser pulses at 1064 nm, showing strong absorption characteristics, greater modulation depth, and very low saturation.418 These features show the potential of 2D perovskites in the field of optoelectronics, and their future development prospects are immeasurable.

Over the past few years, the scope of application of 2D perovskite materials has been expanded beyond photodetectors, light emitting diodes, lasers, and solar cells. Perovskite-based sensing systems have recently attracted much attention.422–425 For example, in view of the inherent instability of 3D perovskites,422 Sayantan Sasmal et al. prepared 2D perovskite (OA)2PbI4, which could withstand multiple cycles of exposure to NH3 gas, and achieved reliable and reversible gas sensing performance.423 The sensing mechanism was attributed to the fact that NH3 gas can partially and reversibly replace the organic cations in perovskites with NH4+, which led to the PL quenching of the perovskites. The much improved NH3 gas sensing properties (e.g., good reversibility, fast response and excellent stability) of 2D (OA)2PbI4 as compared to traditional 3D perovskites like (CH3NH3)PbI4 could be ascribed to the following reasons. First, the decomposed OA from (OA)2PbI4 is less volatile compared to CH3NH2 decomposed from (CH3NH3)PbI4, which makes OA more readily recombine with PbI4 and then give a layered structure. Second, the layered structure with flexibly packed alkyl chains provides more voids for percolation of NH3 molecules into the perovskite lattices and ensures a fast and reversible exchange of protons between OA+ and NH3.

2. 2D metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)

2.1 Preparation methods and chemical properties. 
MOFs are crystalline porous materials constructed by coordination of metal ions or clusters with polytopic organic ligands, possessing many promising features, such as tunable structure and function, large surface area, and highly ordered pores.22,427,430 In particular, the specific functionality of MOFs could be achieved by changing the metal ions and ligands. The synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets has been developed via top-down and bottom-up methods. The top-down methods are mainly based on sonication-assisted exfoliation,431,432 while the bottom-up methods include interfacial synthesis, three-layer synthesis, surfactant-assisted synthesis, and small molecule synthesis methods.426–428,430,433–440 Layered 2D MOF crystals are constructed by stacking each layer along the vertical direction via weak interactions, such as van der Waals forces and/or hydrogen bonding. The sonication exfoliation method can break the weak interlayer interaction to disassemble layered bulk MOFs into single- or few-layered MOF nanosheets.426,439 Li et al. reported the delamination of MOF-2 (ZnBDC, BDC = 1,4-benzene dicarboxylate) using sonication.426 MOF-2 nanosheets had a thickness of 1.5–6.0 nm and lateral dimensions ranging from 100 nm to 1 μm (Fig. 32a and b). The effect of different solvents on the stripping of MOF-2 was also investigated and acetone was found to be the best. Although the exact role of the solvent is not clear, the surface energy of the solvent is believed to play a key role in the exfoliation of bulk MOFs, similar to the case of exfoliation of graphite.439 Other solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), have also been used for the exfoliation of 2D MOFs.22 Sonication-assisted exfoliation is a simple and effective method for the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets. However, this method has some limitations in that the obtained nanosheets are not stable due to restacking and the yield and production rate of the nanosheets are generally far too low for practical applications.

Copyright 2015, Nature Publishing Group. 
Different from the top-down exfoliation method, the bottom-up method means the direct synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets from metal ions and ligands.427,428,430,433,437,440 The key issue for this method is to selectively control the growth direction of the MOF crystals and restrict the growth in the vertical direction. Different techniques were utilized to control the growth of MOF crystals (Fig. 32c–g), including interfacial synthesis, surfactant-assisted synthesis (Fig. 32c),435 small molecule synthesis (Fig. 32d428 and Fig. 32e377), supramolecular self-assembly strategy (Fig. 32f),429 and three-layer synthesis (Fig. 32g).430 The bottom-up methods are preferably used to produce well-dispersed MOF nanosheets in high yield.


2.2 Properties and applications. 
Chaudhari and co-workers achieved concomitant 2D MOF nanosheet synthesis and functionalization of the porous MOF system by a simple supramolecular self-assembly strategy, and demonstrated its application as an adjustable optical sensor.429 Visible to the naked eye were distinct modulations in the emission properties of dispersion of functionalized nanosheets in a range of small-molecule solvents (Fig. 33a and b). Using the same MOF main skeleton with different light-emitting guest molecules, one could adjust the optical bandgap of the nanosheets (Fig. 33c and d).

With the successful preparation of a large number of 2D MOF nanosheets,428,431,432,441–443 their optoelectronic applications have attracted the interest of researchers.436 2D MOFs have the advantages of adjustable structure and function, large surface area and highly ordered holes. Therefore, many applications have been investigated in gas storage and separation,430 photocatalytic degradation of water,434 CO2 reduction and organic reactions,442 luminescence,429 energy storage433,441 and bio-sensing.427,438,444–447
Recently, Zhao and co-workers synthesized uniform ultrathin 2D MOF nanosheets M-TCPP (M = Zn, Cu, Cd or Co, TCPP = tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) with a thickness of sub-10 nm by a surfactant-assisted synthetic method.427 Some 2D M-TCPP nanosheets had been successfully used as fluorescence sensing platforms for DNA detection (Fig. 34a). The two-dimensional Cu-TCPP nanosheets showed the best performance for DNA detection with a detection limit of 20 × 10−12 M, which was much lower than the previously reported MOF particle-based fluorescence detection (Fig. 34b). Wang et al also prepared a series of 2D M-TCPP (Fe) nanosheets (M = Co, Cu, Zn) by surfactant-assisted synthesis (Fig. 34c).435 The 2D M-TCPP (Fe) nanosheet basement membrane was used as a novel electrochemical platform for the detection of H2O2, which showed higher sensitivity than the previously reported native heme protein sensor (Fig. 34d).435 In addition to their application in biological detection, 2D MOFs have also been used in photochemical sensing. Due to the porous structure of 2D MOFs, they not only function as molecular sieves for gas separation,430 but can also function as energy storage systems. Zhao reported a simple bottom-up synthesis of ultrathin Zn (bim) (OAc) MOF nanosheets with thicknesses of about 5 nm. These nanosheets were further heat-treated to give nitrogen-doped porous ultrathin carbon nanosheets (UT-CNS) for energy storage application.433 The UT-CNS showed a capacitance of 278 F g−1 at a high current density of 10 A g−1, which is the best among the reported MOF-derived carbon materials for super-capacitor electrodes. Meanwhile, the UT-CNS also exhibited a high reversible capacity of 553 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1 and retained 100% coulombic efficiency after 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1 as an anode material for lithium ion batteries (Fig. 34e and f).

3. 2D organic metal complexes (OMCs)

3.1 Preparation methods and chemical properties. 
Similar to the 2D MOFs, the currently reported 2D organic metal complexes can be synthesized by “top-down” and “bottom-up” approaches.448–450 As a conventional top-down method, stripping uses ultrasonic solvents to separate the bulk structure to obtain a 2D structure. Cheetham et al. reported a new 2D metal–organic framework material, MnDMS [Mn 2,2-dimethylsuccinate], featuring weakly bound hybrid layers in its bulk crystals that could be readily exfoliated into nanosheets via ultra-sonication. The fully exfoliated hybrid nanosheets corresponded to a single layer thickness of about 1 nm, while the partially exfoliated nanosheets (multi-layer films) exhibited a typical thickness on the order of 10 nm (Fig. 35a–c).451 The bottom-up strategy for the synthesis of 2D coordination organic metal complexes is widely used. Hydrothermal synthesis and solvothermal synthesis are the most common bottom-up strategies.24,452–456 Hydrothermal synthesis refers to a chemical reaction carried out in aqueous solution under high temperature and pressure in a sealed pressure vessel. The method has the advantages of complete grain development, small particle size, uniform distribution, lighter particle agglomeration, and easy availability of suitable chemical substances and crystal forms. The commonly used solvents in solvent thermal synthesis are amines (such as diamine, dimethylformamide, ethanol-amine), alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, etc.), and acetonitrile and pyridine. Renata Diniz and co-workers synthesized Co {[14HBDC][14BDC]0.5[INH]} coordination organic metal complexes by a solvothermal route using the ligands 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid [14BDC], isonicotinylhydrazine [INH] and Co(NO3)·6H2O (Fig. 35d).453 Recently, Javier Troyano et al. synthesized three coordination organic metal complexes by the solvothermal reaction between copper(I) halide and 4-nonylphenol with the general formula [Cu3X(HT)2]n (X = Cl, 1; Br 2 and I 3) (Fig. 35e).456 Lotsch et al. prepared ultrathin 2D zinc coordination organic metal complex nanosheets via surfactant-mediated synthesis and subsequent exfoliation (Fig. 35f).450

3.2 Properties and applications. 
The 2D metal–organic composites have thermochromic luminescence characteristics. Javier Troyano and co-workers discovered that [Cu3X(HT)2]n (X = Cl, 1; Br, 2; and I, 3) showed reversible thermochromic luminescence, with strong orange emission for 1 and 2, but weaker for 3 at room temperature, whereas upon cooling at 77 K 1 and 2 showed stronger yellow emission, and 3 displayed stronger green emission (Fig. 36a).456 The emission spectra of 1–3 were recorded at varying temperatures (from 300 to 110 K). By lowering the temperature from room temperature to 110 K, for the composite 1, the main emission still has a similar energy value, while the shoulder to higher energy occurs at 575 nm (Fig. 36b). For complex 2, a gradual blue shift was observed from 660 to 613 nm (Fig. 36c). In the case of complex 3, the temperature change experiment showed that the emission occurred at 250 K, concentrated at 565 nm, and the energy gradually shifted to 544 nm at 110 K (Fig. 36d). Recently, Salome Delgado et al. reported reversible thermochromic luminescence behavior of [CuMCT]n upon cooling, which changed its color from pale orange to green (Fig. 36e and f).24 As a new type of 2D materials, 2D metal–organic complexes not only overcome the shortcomings of difficult to process inorganic particles alone, low strength, and poor stability of organic polymers, but also have the quantum size effect, small size effect, surface effect, blocking effect of Coulomb and quantum tunneling, macroscopic quantum tunneling, and mechanical properties. These unique properties indicate that they have broad application prospects in the fields of photo-degradation,452 thermochromic materials,24,456 photocatalysis457 and gas adsorption etc.448,449,453,458–465

One of the most representatives is the metalloporphyrin organic complex. Andringa et al. prepared a self-assembled monolayer 2D iron porphyrin FET, a new type of sensitive gas sensor for direct detection of NO (Fig. 37a).459 The FET sensor was highly sensitive due to the fact that the analyte and the active channel are separated by only one monolayer (Fig. 37b). When exposed to NO, a threshold voltage shift to positive gate bias was observed. The sensor response was checked as a function of NO concentration. High sensitivity had been demonstrated by the detection of parts per billion (ppb) concentrations of NO. Very recently, Lai Xu introduced a series of metal atoms (Fe, Mg, Mn, and Cu) into the center of the porphyrin ring to modify its capacity for reducing CO2. Finally, transition state (TS) search calculations revealed that the Fe-modified 2D conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) possessed the highest catalytic activity toward CO2 reduction.457 Apart from sensor and CO2 reduction applications, the 2D metal organic complex also has an important application in photocatalytic degradation. Vimal K. Bhardwaj employed the 2D polymeric complex {[K(NiL)]·xCH3CN}n with promising photocatalytic activities for the degradation of organic dyes (Fig. 37c and d).452 Wang and colleagues proposed 2D ZnII/CdII coordination polymers, namely {[Zn(L1)(mip)]·H2O}n, {[Zn2(L1)2(hip)2]·H2O}n, {[Cd(L1)(hip)]·4H2O}n, and {[Cd3(L1)(chda)3]·4H2O}n [L1 = N,N-di(pyridin-3-yl)pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide, H2mip = 5-methylisophthalic acid, H2hip = 5-hydroxyisophthalic acid, H2oba = 4,4′-oxybis(benzoicacid), H2chda = trans-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid], which had been hydrothermally synthesized and structurally characterized. The photocatalytic activity of the composite photocatalysts in wastewater purification was evaluated by photocatalytic activity tests on dye contaminants such as methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO), rhodamine B (RhB) and congo red (CR). The photocatalytic activity and selectivity of the above compounds demonstrate that they may be good and stable photocatalysts that can degrade organic dyes (Fig. 37e and f).462

Conclusions
In this contribution, we have firstly overviewed the recent development of light-emitting 2D inorganic semiconductors such as TMDs and phosphorene. These materials can be prepared via various methods, such as mechanical exfoliation, liquid phase exfoliation, chemical/electrochemical intercalation and exfoliation, solid-state vapor phase deposition and wet-chemical synthesis. Some of the methods are able to produce high-quality 2D crystals on substrates, while others can massively produce single- to few-layered nanosheets in solution but dense surface defects are not avoidable. The light-emitting properties of these materials can be tuned via several strategies. For instance, substrates and surface capping layers, as well as solvent molecules, can all act as doping agents to change the exciton/trion concentrations; temperature, strain, and alloying can adjust their band structures. Even defects can be controlled and take part in the excitonic/quantum emission. Particularly phosphorene, a 2D material very different from TMDs or graphene, possesses an anisotropic in-plane structure, and thus exhibits non-symmetric light adsorption and emission properties. Although its preparation is limited mostly to top-down exfoliation, its widely tunable direct bandgaps ranging from UV to NIR are very attractive and promising for various optoelectronic applications. Heterostructures of 2D materials show strong interlayer coupling, and reveal interlayer excitonic emissions in the vertical configuration, and enhanced emission at the interface in the lateral configuration. Moreover, light-emitting devices such as LEDs and lasers have been constructed from 2D materials by coupling them with other functional architectures for greatly enhanced performance in terms of power consumption, quantum efficiency and/or unidirectionality. The potential applications of inorganic 2D materials have also been demonstrated in bioimaging. One of the future challenges of inorganic 2D materials lies in their thickness, phase, composition, and size controlled synthesis in large scale with high quality. Especially for 2D heterostructures, despite their promising properties, most of them have been prepared by vapor phase growth or layer-by-layer stacking. Recent reports indicate the possibility of using solution-phase epitaxy to produce heterostructures in large scale, and further effort should be devoted to adding more controllability in the crystalline quality and thickness of the resulting materials.466–468 As for their practical applications, since the light-emitting properties of various 2D materials are highly dependent on environmental factors, optical sensors for temperature, stress/strain, gases, and solvents based on these materials deserve further investigations. Furthermore, creating p–n junctions in 2D TMDs has been realized by applying different electrostatic gating, or interfacing differently doped 2D materials. The ability to selectively p- or n-dope a homogeneous 2D material could also be ventured based on a recent report,469 which may enable better control of their light emission properties and provoke more exploration of light-emitting heterojunctions with versatile material constituents.
We then critically reviewed the recent advances of 2D organic (e.g., organic small molecules, polymers, supramolecular, and COFs) and organic–inorganic (perovskites, MOFs, and organic metal complexes) light-emitting materials in order to achieve a better fundamental understanding of their preparation, properties, and applications. Compared to 2D inorganic light-emitting materials, 2D organic and organic–inorganic light-emitting materials have exhibited controllable synthesis, easy assembly, flexibility and excellent photoelectric properties, which may eventually promote the large-scale implementation of 2D materials. The strategies for the realization of 2D organic and organic–inorganic light-emitting materials have been intensively investigated. Moreover, 2D organic and organic–inorganic light-emitting materials have a wide range of applications over light emission, such as field-effect transistors, light-emitting diodes, solar cells, photodetectors, bio-fluorescence detection, and energy storage. Although the device performance is still low compared to 2D inorganic materials due to the nature of organic materials with strong exciton coupling and weak interaction in between, it lays the foundation for further development of organic and organic–inorganic material based 2D materials. In spite of the extensive exploration of 2D organic and organic–inorganic light-emitting materials in terms of preparation, properties, and applications, new challenges still remain. First, from the perspective of material synthesis, the current production, quality, quantity, and productivity of 2D organic and organic–inorganic light-emitting materials are far from the standards required for industrial application or commercialization, especially, the high output and large-scale production. Second, the ultra-thin 2D organic and organic–inorganic light-emitting materials, which play an important role in optoelectronic, energy, storage, and information applications, are still in their early stage. Third, most current 2D organic and organic–inorganic light-emitting materials suffer from long-term stability and durability issues due to their relatively low physical and/or chemical stability, thus limiting their potential applications.
