    , Accepted 23rd January 2013First published on 23rd January 2013AbstractA new two-dimensional small molecule (DCA3T(VT)BDT) with an acceptor–donor–acceptor framework showed a high power conversion efficiency of 4% with a high fill factor of up to 0.63 in solution-processed organic solar cells.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) offer great opportunities as renewable energy sources because of their unique advantages of low cost, light-weight and good mechanical flexibility.1,2 For polymer-based OSCs, the peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) has shown a dramatic increase which exceeds 9%, recently.3 Compared to their polymeric counterparts, small molecules have attracted considerable attention due to the unique advantages of defined molecular structure, definite molecular weight, high purity and good batch-to-batch reproducibility. Much progress of solution-processed OSCs based on small-molecule organic donors and fullerene acceptors has been made with a PCE of up to 7.38%.4 In most cases, however, the relatively low fill factor (FF < 50%) due to the poorer film quality and unbalanced charge transport results in low PCE and this becomes a bottleneck of small-molecule OSCs to be commercialized.5,6
In recent years, small molecular organic materials with promising performance such as star- or X-shaped molecular frameworks7–13 and linear analogues with D–A–D or A–D–A structure (D = donor, A = acceptor) have been developed.4,14–16 Zhan and co-workers reported a three-dimensional, star-shaped small molecule, S(TPA-BT-HTT) with a PCE of 4.3%.13 Bazan et al. synthesized a core A–D–A framework with end-capping donor units in a small molecule, DTS(PTTh2)2, which demonstrated a PCE as high as 6.7%.4b Chen and co-workers designed and synthesized a linear small molecule, DR3TBDT, which shows excellent photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 7.38%, which is the highest efficiency reported to date for small molecule based solar cells and approaches the value for polymer solar cells.4d
Unlike three-dimensional and linear small molecules, only a very limited number of high efficiency two-dimensional small-molecule OSCs are known, even though some interesting results have been achieved for the two-dimensional conjugated polymers. Li and co-workers have developed a new family of conjugated polymers with conjugated side chains.17 This type of polymers features high hole mobility and broad absorption profile, thanks to the overlapping of the side chain interactions derived from both conjugated main chain and side chains. The OSC based on PT5TPA as donor and indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) as acceptor gave nicely a PCE of 3.6%.17c
In the past few years, much attention has been paid to bandgap and molecular control of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) based polymers.18 BDT has a symmetric and planar conjugated structure, and most importantly, it exhibits an excellent hole mobility. Therefore, in view of the advantages due to the two-dimensional conjugated polymer structure and BDT functionalities, we report a new two-dimensional push–pull small molecule, DCA3T(VT)BDT, with electron-donating central BDT donor, electron-withdrawing alkyl cyanoacetate end-capped groups and oligothiophene as the arm carrying 2-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene conjugated side chains. DCA3T(VT)BDT shows excellent solution processability and thermal stability and broad and strong absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared regions. The conjugated thiophene side chain effectively lowers the HOMO level, which is desirable for obtaining high open-circuit voltage (Voc). DCA3T(VT)BDT:PC70BM (1:0.5 w/w) exhibited a hole mobility of 6.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs based on DCA3T(VT)BDT:PCB70M (1:0.5, w/w) without the need for any post-treatment showed a PCE as high as 4.0% with a relatively high FF of up to 0.63 and high Voc of 0.92 V.
Synthesis and characterization of DCA3T(VT)BDT are given in the ESI‡ (Scheme S1). The intermediate 8 was synthesized through Still coupling reaction between (E)-5′′-bromo-4′′-(2-(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)vinyl)-3,3′-dihexyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene]-5-carbaldehyde (6) and (4,8-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(tributylstannane)19 (7) using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst for 24 h. DCA3T(VT)BDT was obtained by the Knoevenagel condensation of 8 with octyl cyanoacetate (Scheme 1), which possesses good solubility in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane and chloroform. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals that the onset decomposition temperature with 5% weight-loss (Td) of DCA3T(VT)BDT is 337 °C, which is adequately suitable for OSC fabrication and evaluation.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of DCA3T(VT)BDT. 

Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectra of DCA3T(VT)BDT in dilute chlorobenzene solution (10−5 M) and in thin solid film, in which it exhibits strong absorption in the visible region (300–700 nm) in both cases. In solution, the absorption peak at around 352 nm corresponds to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone,20 whereas the lower energy absorption band peaking at 484 nm with the extinction coefficient of 5.33 × 104 M−1 cm−1 is ascribed to the intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition. In comparison to their absorption in solution, the absorption bands of DCA3T(VT)BDT as film were red-shifted, extending the absorption edge from 590 nm in solution to 676 nm in the solid state, corresponding to the bandgap (Eg) of 1.83 eV. The absorption peak of DCA3T(VT)BDT as thin film (557 nm) is bathochromically shifted by 73 nm relative to that in solution (484 nm), thus indicating a better packing due to the strong interchain π–π interaction of the molecule in the bulk.22

Since the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of photovoltaic donor materials are crucial parameters for their application in OSCs, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to study the electrochemistry of the drop-cast film and the energy levels were calculated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials by assuming the energy level of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) to be −4.8 eV below the vacuum level.21 (The formal potential of Fc/Fc+ was measured as 0.07 V against Ag/Ag+.) Fig. 1b displays the cyclic voltammogram of the DCA3T(VT)BDT film on a glassy carbon electrode in 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The onset oxidation and reduction potential are 0.60 and −1.29 V, respectively, vs. Ag/Ag+. The corresponding HOMO and LUMO energies were estimated to be −5.33 eV and −3.44 eV, respectively. Encouragingly, DCA3T(VT)BDT presents a fairly low-lying HOMO level, which guaranteed high Voc of the OSCs when blended with PC70BM, because the Voc is proportional to the energy difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor.22b To provide further insight into the fundamental aspects of molecular architecture of DCA3T(VT)BDT, molecular simulation using density functional theory (DFT) was carried out. As depicted in Fig. 2, the electron density distributions at LUMO are highly localized near the electron-withdrawing group, while the electron density distributions at HOMO are highly localized on the electron-donating group as well as the adjacent thiophene rings.

The hole mobility of DCA3T(VT)BDT was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with the device structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PEDOT:PSS/Ag (100 nm). A decent hole mobility of 6.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained from the pristine DCA3T(VT)BDT:PC70BM (1:0.5, w/w) film, which is essential for highly efficient OSCs, and this value has the same order of magnitude as the hole mobilities found for some donor materials in highly efficient OSCs.3b,4d
The photovoltaic properties of DCA3T(VT)BDT were preliminarily investigated by fabricating solution-processable BHJ devices with a conventional structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DCA3T(VT)BDT:PC70BM/Ca (15 nm)/Ag (80 nm), the detailed device fabrication process is described in the ESI‡ and the key device parameters are listed in Table 1. To optimize the device condition, devices with different donor:acceptor weight ratios were examined.

All the devices yielded relatively high Voc (0.88–0.92 V) which are consistent with the deeper low-lying HOMO and relatively insensitive to the donor:acceptor ratio. It was shown that the OSC with the donor:acceptor weight ratio of 1:0.5 showed the best PCE of 4.0% under the illumination of AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2. The FF of 0.63 is a relatively high value for small-molecule OSC. The devices with the weight ratios of 1:0.75 and 1:1 gave lower PCEs at 2.74% and 1.75% respectively, together with significantly lower FF. The PCE of the OSCs decreased drastically to 0.52% at the ratio of 1:2 due to the remarkably lower Jsc and FF. The reason for the lower performance at the three different ratios was discussed in the ESI.‡Fig. 3 shows a typical current density–voltage (J–V) curve of the OSC based on DCA3T(VT)BDT:PC70BM (1:0.5, w/w) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) plot of the OSC. The EQE curve of the device covered a broad wavelength range of 300–670 nm with a maximum EQE value of 48% at 510 nm, which indicates that the absorption of the DCA3T(VT)BDT donor and the PC70BM acceptor all contribute to the photo-electronic conversion. From the EQE spectra, the calculated photocurrent density is 6.81 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the Jsc value (6.89 mA cm−2), if we consider a little degradation of the device performance during the EQE measurement in air.

Nanoscale phase separation in the morphology of the active layer is required for high performance OSCs, which enables a large interfacial area for exciton dissociation and a continuous percolating path for hole and electron transport to the corresponding electrodes.22 The active layer morphology was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode. From the AFM phase image of the blend film of DCA3T(VT)BDT:PC70BM (see Fig. S2, ESI‡), the film with a blend ratio of 1:0.5 exhibited a better interpenetrating network. This nanoscale interpenetrating network is beneficial to the exciton dissociation, charge transport and thus enhanced efficiency of the OSCs.
In conclusion, a new two-dimensional small molecule, DCA3T(VT)BDT, with an A–D–A framework in the main chain and 2-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene conjugated side chain was synthesized. DCA3T(VT)BDT has excellent solution processability and thermal stability, broad and strong absorption feature, appropriate energy levels that are in good match with PC70BM, respectable hole mobility and good film-forming morphology. The BHJ OSCs based on DCA3T(VT)BDT:PC70BM (1:0.5, w/w) afforded a high PCE of 4.0% and a notable FF of 0.63 without the need for any special treatment. This preliminary work demonstrates that this kind of two-dimensional small molecules offers a good strategy to design new photovoltaic small molecule-based donor materials with high FF and Voc for high-efficiency OSCs. We envisage that further optimization of the morphology on an active layer would greatly improve the performance of devices.
