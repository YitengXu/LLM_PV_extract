    , Accepted 30th July 2018First published on 31st July 2018AbstractThree different non-fullerene small molecular acceptors containing N-annulated perylene diimide, named di-PNR, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR, were successfully designed and synthesized for photovoltaic applications. Introducing an electron donating unit such as triphenylamine (TPA) or 2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxine (EDOT) into the N-annulated PDI derivatives significantly influences the light-harvesting capabilities, energy level, morphology as well as the photovoltaic performance. Preliminarily, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR possessed lower band gaps and higher HOMO/LUMO energy levels. Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 5.29% and 4.54% were obtained for the inverted solar cells based on the blends of PTB7-Th/di-PNR and PTB7-Th/TPA-PNR, respectively, resulting from the smooth morphology of the blend films and the intense light absorption that increases the Jsc and FF. Under the same optimization conditions, EDOT-PNR exhibited a low PCE of 1.6% with a remarkably high Voc of 1.14 V because of its higher LUMO energy level, which was one of the highest Voc values reported for organic solar cells using N-annulated PDI derivatives as electron acceptors. Our work offers effective guidelines for the design of non-fullerene acceptors using N-annulated PDI derivatives.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) containing fullerene acceptors have attracted extensive research attention for their promising applications in the next generation of clean and renewable energy sources owing to their unique advantages, such as low cost, light-weight, large area production and mechanical flexibility.1–6 High-performance BHJ OSCs have been reported with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11%.7 Very recently, BHJ OSCs with non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have received considerable attention as a promising alternative to fullerene BHJ OSCs and the PCE has reached 14%,8,9 which rewrote the PCE record for fullerene BHJ OSCs. Compared with fullerene derivatives, NFAs possess some distinctive advantages,10–15e.g. adjustable chemical structures and energy levels, inexpensive synthetic cost, improved light absorption in the visible region, and enhanced match capability with donor materials. Intensive research interest has been devoted to designing and synthesizing NFAs for replacing fullerene acceptors in BHJ OSCs, and a series of high-performance NFAs has been developed and successfully applied to high-performance BHJ OSCs; two representative NFAs are the system of perylene diimide (PDI) and the 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (ITIC) family.16–20 The PCEs of the BHJ OSCs based on the family of ITIC acceptors have exceeded 12%,18 while the best-performing BHJ OSCs based on PDI show a PCE around 10%.19 Actually, PDI derivatives show appealing characteristics including excellent chemical, photochemical, and thermal stabilities, high electron mobility (10−3–101 cm2 V−1 s−1), strong absorption in the visible region (between 400 and 650 nm), and superior electron affinity (ca. −4.0 eV). The solubility, energy levels and optoelectronic properties could be readily tuned.21–24 Yet, the high planarity and strong intermolecular stacking of PDI tend to cause excessive aggregation, resulting in easily forming large crystalline domains and phase separation in BHJ films, which is not conducive to the photovoltaic performance of BHJ OSCs.25–29
Several strategies were adopted to suppress the strong aggregation tendency of PDI derivatives.30–32 Constructing PDI dimers via introducing torsion into the conjugated backbone is an effective method to obtain highly efficient NFAs,33 which can be connected by a single bond34 or π-bridge units including oligothiophene,35 selenophene,36 phenylene37 and biphenylene;38 other fused aromatic rings were also used to construct PDI dimers, such as benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT),39 indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT)40 and 9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene] (SBF).41 Another common method is substitution of the imide position, bay position or non-bay position of the PDI units with different functional groups to construct PDI trimers or tetramers with three dimensional (3D) geometry.42–44 This method can also effectively reduce molecular aggregation of PDIs. In addition to this, incorporating heteroatoms such as S,45 Se,46 or N47 in the bay positions of the PDI framework is considered to be a more effective route to reduce intermolecular aggregation. SdiPDI-S containing S-annulation in the PDI framework was reported by Wang's group and used for OSCs showing a PCE over 7%.45 Meanwhile, Z. H. Wang and his coworkers developed the Se-annulated PDI dimer SdiPDI-Se with an admirable PCE.46 A ternary organic solar cell based on SdiPDI-Se as the electron acceptor yielded a PCE of 10.3%.47 A N-annulated PDI dimer was exploited by Welch's group and it realized a PCE of 7.55% when it was blended with P3TEA.48 They further designed some N-annulated PDI derivatives as acceptors and successfully applied them to BHJ OSCs.49–51 However, few studies have reported constructing N-annulated PDI based A–D–A NFAs as previously done with other PDI derivatives.
In this work, considering the excellent photovoltaic performance of the N-annulated PDI dimer, we designed and synthesized three different non-fullerene small molecule acceptors containing N-annulated PDI, named di-PNR, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR (Fig. 1). Longer branched alkyl chains were introduced to N-annulated PDI to improve the solubility. An electron donating unit such as TPA or EDOT was introduced to the N-annulated PDI derivatives, which influenced the light-harvesting capabilities, energy level, morphology as well as the photovoltaic performance. The energy band gaps and HOMO/LUMO levels were compared according to the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements and theoretical simulations. As a preliminary result, the devices based on PTB7-Th/di-PNR and PTB7-Th/TPA-PNR yielded a PCE of 5.29% and 4.54%, respectively. The smooth morphology of the blend films and the intense light absorption increased the Jsc and FF. Although solar cells using EDOT-PNR as the electron acceptor exhibited poor device performance (1.60%), the device delivered an impressively high Voc of up to 1.14 V, which is one of the highest Voc values reported for organic solar cells using N-annulated PDI derivatives as the electron acceptors.

Experimental section
Materials
Bis(pinacolato)diboron and Pd(PPh3)4 were purchased from Energy Chemical Inc. Some intermediate products, such as tris(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)-amine and 5,7-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxine, were synthesized according to reported procedures with optimization, and the detailed synthetic procedures are described in the ESI.† Toluene and THF were freshly distilled from Na metal prior to use. Other solvents and reagents were used directly without any treatment.
General instruments

1H NMR and 13C NMR data were recorded on a Bruker Ultra Shield Plus AV400 spectrometer in CDCl3 solution at 298 K with tetramethylsilane (TMS; d = 0 ppm) as the internal standard (1H NMR: 400 MHz; 13C NMR: 100 MHz). Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was conducted by using a Bruker Autoflex II mass spectrometer using anthracene-1,8,9-triol as the matrix. Thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis was performed using a Rigaku TG-DTA 8120 thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrometer. CV measurements were conducted on a CHI 620C electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode system containing tetrabutylammonium phosphorus hexafluoride (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) as an electrolyte in anhydrous dichloromethane at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Surface roughness and morphologies of the thin films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Thermo. Auto Probe C P Res.). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out via a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV.
Fabrication and characterization of inverted solar cells
Solution-processed non-fullerene BHJ organic solar cells were fabricated with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. ITO glass substrates were cleaned sequentially with deionized water, alcohol and acetone for 15 min each by sonication and then treated in an UV ozone generator for 15 min. A thin layer of sol–gel ZnO was spin coated onto precleaned ITO glass substrates and then annealed at 180 °C for 15 min.52 Following this, the active layer films were prepared by spin-coating PTB7-Th:acceptor (di-PNR, TPA-PNR or EDOT-PNR) solutions. The thickness of the active layer was determined to be ca. 100 nm by using a Dektak 150 profilometer. Lastly, MoO3 and Ag were thermally evaporated under a vacuum of 2 × 104 Pa on top of the active layer. The photovoltaic performance was measured by a computer-programmed Keithley 4200 source meter under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the organic solar cells was measured with a source meter, silicon photodiode and a computer controlled light source-monochromator-lock-in system.

Results and discussion
Material synthesis and thermal properties

Fig. 1 shows the molecular structures of the target compounds di-PNR, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR. Scheme 1 depicts their synthetic routes. Firstly, PNR was synthesized following modified procedures.47di-PNR, as the homocoupled PNR, was obtained using Pd(dppf)Cl2 as the catalyst and DMF/H2O as the solvent under alkaline conditions. TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR were synthesized by the Suzuki and Stille coupling reactions,53–55 respectively. The chemical structures of di-PNR, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR were unambiguously confirmed utilizing 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF MS measurements (see ESI†). As expected, di-PNR, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR exhibited excellent solubility in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene etc. Their excellent solubility is beneficial for the solution-processing technique in the fabrication of organic solar cells. The thermal properties of di-PNR, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR were measured by thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and Table 1, the decomposition temperature (Td) values at 5 wt% under a N2 atmosphere are over 390 °C, which is high enough for organic solar cells or other optoelectronic applications.

Theoretical analysis
Density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculation with the B3LYP-6-31G(d) basis set was used to understand the molecular geometry of the three compounds di-PNR, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR. The alkyl side chains attached on the PNR skeleton were replaced with methyl groups to simplify the calculations and save calculation power. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as electronic-density distribution are shown in Fig. 2. Compound di-PNR exhibits a dihedral angle of 91.7° between the two PNR subunits owing to the intrinsic steric hindrance. In contrast to di-PNR, the torsion angles between PNR subunits and the EDOT unit increased to 55.5°. For TPA-PNR, the torsion angles are about 67.2°, 67.9° and 68.2° between each benzene ring and the PNR subunits, respectively. Clearly, these molecules display a twisted structure, which could be beneficial for reducing aggregation among the PDI molecules.54 Additionally, the distributions of electron density were also calculated for the three molecules. For TPA-PNR, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels mainly locate at the three PNR subunits, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels localize on the core unit, suggesting a significant charge polarization in the exited state. The LUMO energy levels of EDOT-PNR focus on the two PNR subunits, however, the HOMO energy levels localize along the whole molecule. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of di-PNR, TPA-PNR, EDOT-PNR are −5.95/−3.19 eV, −5.45/−3.17 eV and −5.69/−3.21 eV, respectively. Obviously, by constructing A–D–A type NFAs with PNR and electron donating units, the energy levels and bandgaps can both be tuned.

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of diPNR, TriPNR and EDOT-PNR in dilute dichloromethane solutions (∼10−5 M) and solid films (prepared by spin-coating on quartz) were measured and they are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The major data are summarized in Table 1. In the dilute dichloromethane solution, di-PNR, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR displayed similar absorption features with a broad absorption peak ranging from 400 to 570 nm as per previously reported results.30 The maximum extinction coefficients were 2.36 × 105 M−1 cm−1, 1.97 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and 0.75 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively. The relatively high extinction coefficients may be beneficial for improving the ability of light absorption and Jsc as well as the photovoltaic performance. The absorption peak of the three compounds in the thin films showed no obvious red-shift in comparison to those in solution, suggesting that aggregation of the three molecules in the thin films may be suppressed owing to the torsion existing in each compound. Note that TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR showed a slightly wider absorption than di-PNR. Accordingly, the optical band gaps (Eoptg) of di-PNR, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR calculated from the absorption edges of the thin films are 2.04, 1.87 and 2.00 eV, respectively. These results suggest that the incorporation of TPA and EDOT has a significant influence on the light harvesting ability and the optical band gaps of the target NAFs. Fig. 3c shows the absorption spectra of the blended films. Obviously, the spectral features of the three compounds exhibit good complementarity with the absorption of PTB7-Th (as the donor material in the blended films). Moreover, the blend films PTB7-Th:TPA-PNR, especially PTB7-Th:di-PNR, exhibited a stronger absorption than PTB7-Th:EDOT-PNR, which is essential for achieving a higher Jsc in organic solar cells.

Electrochemical properties
CV measurements with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode were carried out to investigate the electrochemical properties of di-PNR, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 anhydrous dichloromethane. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated from the onset oxidation potential (Eox) and reduction potential (Ered), respectively. The CV curves of the three molecules are shown in Fig. 3d and the related electrochemical data are shown in Table 1. The HOMO energy levels of di-PNR, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR are −5.97, −5.45, and −5.75 eV, respectively, while the LUMO energy levels are −3.75, −3.65, and −3.68 eV, respectively. Their HOMO and LUMO energy levels were obviously lower than those of the polymer donor material PTB7-Th (HOMO/LUMO: −5.12 eV/−3.60 eV).56TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR exhibit slightly higher HOMO and LUMO energy levels in comparison with those of di-PNR, demonstrating that the introduction of the electron donating unit could raise the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which is attributed to the electron-donating properties of the TPA and EDOT units. It is well known that Voc is proportional to the difference between the HOMO of the donor material and the LUMO of the acceptor material,57 thus the slightly higher LUMO of TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR may lead to an improved Voc in organic solar cells. The experimental results of CV are in good agreement with the absorption spectra and the theoretical calculations. Given the above, introducing the electron donating units into the N-annulated PDI derivatives can effectively tune the band gaps as well as the energy levels of the target NFAs.
Solar cell fabrication and characterization
To explore the photovoltaic properties of the three NFAs, BHJ OSCs devices were fabricated with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/donor polymer:acceptor/MoO3/Ag. The commercially available PTB7-Th was chosen as the donor material owing to the complementary absorption (Fig. 3c) and suitable energy levels that match well with di-PNR, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR (Fig. 4). The device fabrication conditions, such as different D/A weight ratios (1:1.5, 1:1 and 1:0.8), and the solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) were used to optimize the device performance. Fig. 5a shows the typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs under AM 1.5 solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Table 2 summarizes the related device parameters. The blend films of donor polymer:acceptor as the active layer were spin-coated from chlorobenzene solution and the optimized weight ratio of donor to acceptor was 1:1.

For di-PNR, the devices based on di-PNR:PTB7-Th display a Jsc of 11.67 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.03 V, a FF of 44.0% and a best PCE of 5.29% with 0.25 v/v% DIO as the solvent additive, which is higher than the device performance based on S(TPA-PDI) as the electron acceptor.42TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR yielded an inferior PCE of 4.54% and 1.60% owing to the lower Jsc and FF under the same conditions, which may stem from the weaker absorption intensity. Note that the devices using TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR as the acceptors exhibited a relatively higher Voc because of their slightly higher LUMO energy levels; especially for EDOT-PNR, the device delivered an impressively high Voc of up to 1.14 V, which is one of the highest Voc values reported for organic solar cells using N-annulated PDI derivatives as the acceptors.48–51 In particular, TPA-PNR based OSCs devices displayed a PCE of 4.54%, which is 37% higher than that of S(TPA-PDI) (PCE = 3.32%).41 Meanwhile, the Voc of the TPA-PNR based devices is around 1.08 V, which is also higher than that of the S(TPA-PDI) based devices (Voc = 0.88 V). These results suggest that PNR is a superior building block for constructing A–D–A type NFAs. The External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized devices based on polymer donor:acceptor blend films are shown in Fig. 5b. The devices based on di-PNR and TPA-PNR exhibited photo-to-current responses from 350 to 800 nm with the maximum EQE values reaching 49% and 41%, respectively. The calculated Jsc values integrated from the EQE for the optimum devices are 11.56 mA cm−2 for di-PNR and 9.87 mA cm−2 for TPA-PNR, respectively, which are pretty close to the Jsc obtained from the J–V measurements.
The surface morphology of the active layer is an important factor for device performance. Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to investigate the surface morphologies of the blend films with DIO as the solvent additive. As shown in Fig. 6a–c, the Root Mean Square (RMS) values are 0.8 nm, 1.02 nm, and 1.34 nm for PTB7-Th/di-PNR, PTB7-Th/TPA-PNR and PTB7-Th/EDOT-PNR under the same conditions. The difference of the surface morphologies may result from the different aggregation behaviors of di-PNR, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR. Additionally, the smoother morphologies of PTB7-Th/di-PNR and PTB7-Th/TPA-PNR indicated the excellent miscibility between the donor and the acceptor materials, which could lead to the formation of bicontinuous interpenetrating networks. The results of TEM are consistent with the AFM observations, as shown in Fig. 6d–f. The blend films of di-PNR and TPA-PNR exhibited a uniform surface morphology with the appropriate domain size, resulting in exciton dissociation and charge transport and hence a better photovoltaic performance.

The hole and electron mobilities of the devices were measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method to investigate the charge-transporting behaviors of the active layer. Under the optimized conditions, the devices based on di-PNR/PTB7-Th exhibited a higher hole and electron mobility of 1.6 × 10−4 and 3.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are slightly higher than the hole (1.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron (3.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) mobility of TPA-PNR/PTB7-Th. The device based on EDOT-PNR/PTB7-Th showed a lower hole (6.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron (8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) mobility compared to the di-PNR/PTB7-Th and TPA-PNR/PTB7-Th devices. Obviously, these results indicate that higher h/e mobilities result in higher Jsc and PCE values in OPV devices. Moreover, the unbalanced hole and electron mobility may be responsible for the relatively low photovoltaic performance, and the mobility data are consistent with the trend in the photovoltaic performance.
Conclusions
In summary, three small molecular NFAs, di-PNR, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR, were synthesized and characterized. Introducing electron donating units into N-annulated PDI derivatives influences their light-harvesting capabilities, energy level, morphology as well as their photovoltaic performance. Compared to di-PNR, TPA-PNR and EDOT-PNR possessed lower band gaps and higher HOMO/LUMO energy levels. By blending with PTB7-Th, the devices based on di-PNR and TPA-PNR yielded a PCE of 5.29% and 4.54%, respectively, resulting from the smooth and uniform morphology of the blend films and the intense light absorption that increases the Jsc and FF. Although solar cells using EDOT-PNR as the electron acceptor exhibited poor device performance (1.60%), the device delivered an impressively high Voc of up to 1.14 V, which is one of the highest Voc values reported for organic solar cells using N-annulated PDI derivatives as the electron acceptor. The preliminary results offer an effective strategy to design small molecular NFAs based on N-annulated PDI derivatives, especially for tuning the corresponding HOMO/LUMO energy levels. We believe that higher performance OPV devices containing N-annulated PDI derivatives as the electron acceptors may be obtained through further delicate chemical structure design and device optimization in the near future.
