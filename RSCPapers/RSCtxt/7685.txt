    , Accepted 26th December 2017First published on 3rd January 2018AbstractIron triad nanomaterials (including Fe, Co, Ni and their compounds) have attracted much attention in environmental protection and remediation due to their low cost, unique magnetism, suitable electric and electrocatalytic properties, and high specific surface area. They can be used to detect and degrade various environmental pollutants such as heavy metal ions, inorganic anions, and some organic molecules based on different mechanisms, and be magnetically recycled. Even pollutants can be transformed into useful components through specific handling. Considering their convenient and specialized applications in the environmental field, herein, we review the most recent progress in the detection, and treatment of contaminants from the environment using iron triad nanomaterials and their recycling with typical examples and deep analyses. The current limitations and issues in these applications will also be presented in order to address the remaining challenges to turn them into developed technologies.

Environmental significance
Nowadays, the diversity in environmental pollution has caused the treatment of different types of pollutants much more difficult. As a low-cost chemical, iron triad nanomaterials have been widely used to treat various types of pollutants including both inorganic and organic pollutants, which involves their detection, degradation, and recycling. Most importantly, their unique magnetic properties can make the separation and recycling of pollutants easier, and their electrocatalytic properties can convert pollutants into economic chemical raw materials.

1. Introduction
With the continuous increase in the population and the rapid development of industry, the spread of pollutants in the environment has become a global issue.1 Environmental pollution mainly includes water pollution, air pollution, soil pollution and pesticide pollution. These pollutants are distributed in the water, soil and air, causing great harm to human health.2 Water pollution involves wastewater that contains organic and inorganic pollutants and other complex compounds. Two types of typical pollutants are heavy metals and dye molecules. The former is usually produced in mining, metal surface treatment, and printing processes which release copper, chromium, cadmium, lead, zinc, mercury and other heavy metals into the environment. These heavy metal ions can cause significant damage to living organisms, are difficult to biodegrade, and can even be transmitted through the food chain and accumulate in the bodies of human and animals.3,4 The latter, dye pollution, usually comes from the paper, plastics, leather, pharmaceutical, food, cosmetics and textile industries.5 The discharge of sewage with dye molecules can lead to aquatic carcinogenesis and mutagenicity.6 Therefore, easy and efficient methods to solve these water problems are necessary instead of the traditional slow, low-efficient, and power-wasting processes.7,8 At the same time, benzene, toluene, xylene and formaldehyde compounds are volatile in the air, which can cause headache, throat irritation, itchy skin, dizziness and fatigue.9 These ubiquitous air pollutants can attack the central nervous system and various respiratory organs, which have a huge impact on the human body. In recent years, nanomaterials and nanotechnology have been introduced to environmental treatment to promote the related processing technology. These materials provide high specific surface areas (SSA) and active sites for adsorption and electrocatalysis, and show superior properties than traditional materials.10,11
Many types of inorganic nanomaterials have been used as adsorbents to remove pollutants. However, most of them are difficult to recycle, which easily leads to secondary pollution.12 Iron triad nanomaterials (iron, cobalt, nickel and their compounds) not only have the common advantages of other nanomaterials including large SSA, but also show fast adsorption, high adsorption efficiency, low cost, and simple desorption process, as well as magnetic separation and collection.13–15 Therefore, they are optimal choices for use in the field of environmental treatment. Herein, the environmental treatments with iron triad nanomaterials are organized in categories based on the applications involved. First, the detection of pollutants is described including organic molecules, inorganic cations and anions. In the following section, the feasibility of the degradation of pollutants and reuse of magnetic adsorbents are introduced. Notably, we discuss pollutant utilization. Specifically, pollutants can be transformed into useful materials during degradation process, which is accompanied with the production of energy such as hydrogen.
2. Detection of contaminants
High concentrations of pollutants may cause acute poisoning. Even minimal doses of some pollutant residues may threaten human health after long-term accumulation in the body. Thus, it is crucial to establish rapid detection methods for environmental pollutants to protect human health and the ecological environment.16,17 The detection includes two parts, organic pollutant (toxic gases, pesticide residue, etc.) and inorganic pollutant (heavy metal ions, harmful anions, etc.) detection.
2.1. Detection of organic pollutants
As is known, organic pollutants in water, soil and air can cause great harm to our health. The common detection techniques include chromatography, mass spectrometry, chromatography-mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and Raman spectroscopy. However, detection with these techniques involve expensive devices and is time consuming due to the complicated procedures to prepare samples. Therefore, facile, rapid and selective detection methods for organic pollutants are highly desirable. In this section, some gas sensors and biosensors based on metal oxide semiconductors are introduced.
The gas sensing characteristics of most transitional metal compounds focus on the remarkable change in resistance before and after exposure to detected gas molecules. Some researchers doped or mixed other ingredients with semiconductors to enhance their sensing properties. For example, Lee’s group synthesized a series of NiO flower-like hierarchical nanostructures doped with different quantities of Cr (Fig. 1a–d) via a simple solvothermal reaction.18 The dynamic sensing transients in Fig. 1e show that the responses (S = Rg/Ra) of the pure NiO, 1.15 at% Cr–NiO, 1.86 at% Cr–NiO, and 2.56 at% Cr–NiO hierarchical nanostructures to 5 ppm of o-xylene were 1.79, 11.61, 16.53, and 21.71, respectively, which reveal enhanced gas sensing responses toward o-xylene by Cr doping. The Cr-doped NiO also showed superior selectivity to o-xylene and toluene, whereas the sensor made of pure NiO nanostructures showed no obvious selectivity to a specific gas. The difference could be attributed to the catalytic promotion of oxidation on the methyl groups by doped Cr. Besides, they also prepared an NiO/NiMoO4 spherical nanocomposite by hydrothermal reaction, and fabricated a gas sensor based on it for the selective detection of xylene gas.19 Their sensor showed high responses with a maximum resistance ratio of 101.5 to 5 ppm for p-xylene and negligible cross-responses (resistance ratios <30) to 5 ppm of toluene, benzene, C2H5OH, CH3COCH3, HCHO, CO, trimethylamine, and NH3. The high selectivity and response to xylene was ascribed to the synergistic combination of NiO and NiMoO4, gas-accessible hierarchical morphology, and electronic sensitization due the addition of Mo.

Sometimes, noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) are decorated on semiconductors to improve their detection limit. For instance, a nanocomposite of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) decorating a magnetic Fe3O4 core was synthesized using cysteamine (SH–NH2) as a linker.20 A hydrolase biosensor was then developed for the detection of the organophosphorus pesticide (OP) methyl parathion based on the self-assembly of methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH) on the Fe3O4@Au nanocomposite. The MPH biosensor showed a rapid response and high selectivity for the detection of methyl parathion, with a linear range of 0.5 to 1000 ng mL−1 and a detection limit of 0.1 ng mL−1.20 The simplicity and flexibility of the proposed method will provide future application in the on-site detection of P–S containing pesticides.
Considering the advantage of magnetic materials of providing an easy way to collect and separate materials by applying an external magnetic field, many scientists have developed Fe3O4-based sensors for the rapid detection of organophosphorus pesticides and benzidine.20–22 Additionally, Au NPs on the surface not only provided fast electron transfer and stabilize enzymes through electrostatic interactions,20 but also showed surface plasmon resonance and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) active properties for an Fe3O4–Au nanocomposite with the selective detection of benzidine at a low detection limit of 0.18 ppm.22
2.2. Detection of inorganic pollutants
Inorganic pollutants include metals, non-metallic ions, and metal complexes and compounds. The field of environmental monitoring mainly involves the detection of cations containing Pb2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Cu2+, and other toxic ions,23,24 as well as anionic pollutants containing NO3−, NO32−, BrO3−, Cl− and Br−.25 Thus, an increasing number of researchers have devoted themselves to exploring new detection technologies for environmental pollutants.26

2.2.1. Cation detection. 
Environmental pollution caused by heavy metal ions especially by some toxic metals is endangers human lives. Recently, their detection was mainly achieved by obtaining optical signal changes with a change in concentration. Magnetic iron oxide cores are used to for magnetic separation.
For instance, Xun et al. synthesized a core–shell structured magnetic nanocomposite modified by an organic fluorescent probe and selective chelating groups, which could realize the simultaneous detection and removal of Cu2+ ions at low concentrations.27 The modified organic molecules of 3-(aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (NDPA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) play the role of emitting fluorescence and linking copper ions, respectively. The fluorescence band of NDPA is centered at 550 nm, which is quenched after the addition of Cu2+ in solution. The fluorescence intensity also changes with a change in the adsorbed copper ion concentration. Even when the concentration of Cu2+ is only 0.05 mg L−1, significant changes in its fluorescence intensity are still observed. This shows that NDPA can be used to detect trace quantities of copper ions effectively.
Besides, rare earth ions are usually introduced due to their strong emission in the visible region. Jing et al. synthesized a luminescent europium-Fe3O4 NPs hybrid.28 The outer modified fluorophore could absorb at 325 nm through the conversion of energy to Eu3+ emission. When copper ions are added, the light energy conversion is prevented and the characteristic red fluorescence of europium is quenched, causing the fluorescence to be colorless. This nanoprobe could detect Cu2+ in a wide pH range (5.0–10.0), and its detection limit is as low as 0.1 nM. It could also be used to detect Cu2+ in living cells, which proves its potential applications in biological analysis.
Zhang et al. synthesized an Au/Fe3O4/GO hybrid material and used it to detect Hg2+ ions.29 Hg2+ ions could be reduced on the Au surface to improve the catalytic activity of the material in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. After the addition of a trace amount of Hg2+, the catalytic activity of this hybrid material dramatically increased and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was oxidized, which caused the intensity of absorption peak at 652 nm to vary linearly with the concentration of Hg2+. The detection limit could reach as low as 0.15 nM.


2.2.2. Anion detection. 
Similarly, iron triad nanomaterials introduced for anion detection are also involved in magnetic separation. Many techniques are available for anion detection, such as spectrophotometry, chemiluminescence, molecular absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence, chromatography and electrochemistry. These methods are flexible and simple with the assistance of hybrid nanomaterials.
Due to its excellent adsorption properties, GO and its derivatives are used in pollutant detection and removal. Bharath et al. synthesized high-quality graphene nanosheets on a large scale via chemical ball milling in the presence of KMnO4 and aspartic acid.30 Then, Fe3O4 NPs were decorated on their surfaces using a simple hydrothermal method. The synthesis and characterization of the obtained Fe3O4-reduced graphene oxide (RGO) hybrid are shown in Fig. 2. The material was loaded onto a glass carbon electrode (GCE) to develop a new sensor for the detection of NO2−. The sensor exhibited good electrocatalytic activity, high sensitivity and stability. Its current response was linear in the range of 0.5 μM and 9.5 mM, and its detection limit and sensitivity were 0.03 μM and 202.5 μM mM−1 cm−2, respectively. In addition, to test the practicality of the fabricated sensor, NO2− in faucet, river and rain water was detected, which confirmed its application potential.

Later, in 2016, Zhang et al. grafted a rhodamine 6G derivative (expressed as Rh6G) into a mesoporous silica capped Fe3O4 nanomaterial for the detection of NO2− (Fe3O4@SiO2@Rh6G).31 The material exhibited a large surface area with improved fluorescence properties, and thus enhanced the inductive properties of nitrite. Its fluorescence intensity and the NO2− concentration in the range of 1–50 μM linearly decreased, and its detection limit was estimated to be 0.8 μM. Importantly, this hybrid could be magnetically collected and more than 95% of its original sense signal recovered after six cycles.
Similar core–shell magnetic composites can also be used to detect other anions. For example, Chen et al. synthesized a new type of core–shell structure based on a polymer ionic liquid (PIL) by free radical copolymerization of 1-ally-3-vinylimidazolium chloride, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and silica-coated magnetite.32 Due to the presence of abundant anion-exchange groups in the PIL, the adsorbent displayed the expected extraction performance for anions including F−, Cl−, Br−, NO2−, NO3−, PO43− and SO42−. In the range of 0.061–0.73 g L−1 and 0.19–2.41 g L−1, a low detection limit (S/N = 3) and limit of quantification (S/N = 10) were achieved for the target anion, respectively.
Obviously, core–shell structures are optimal choices for detecting ion pollutants. Normally, magnetic core NPs serve as a support for the modification of organic molecules or GO, as well as an effective component for magnetic separation. Grafted organic molecules or some inorganic materials with high specific surface areas play the main role for detection with optimal or electric signals change after adsorbing a certain amount of ions. This simple and flexible method has the advantage of low detection limit and wide detection range.

3. Treatment of contaminants
3.1. Treatment of organic pollutants
After detection, the pollutant removal process necessitates the development of various functional nano-adsorbents for high-efficient degradation through adsorption, photocatalysis, Fenton reaction, and other methods. During the treatment of pollutants, these environmentally-friendly methods can be simply performed without secondary pollution.

3.1.1. Adsorption method. 
Compared with traditional methods such as flocculation and membrane filtration, the adsorption method has an unparalleled advantage as a low-energy solid extraction technology. Due to the abundant iron reserves in nature, their environmental benignity, and low cost, iron triad nanomaterials have been regarded as potential candidates for nano-adsorbents.
The most popular structures for adsorbents include mesoporous, hierarchical, and hollow structures with considerable specific surface areas. For example, Wei et al. used a microwave heating method with glycerol as the solvent to synthesize hollow nest-like α-Fe2O3 spheres with a specific surface area of 152.42 m2 g−1, which showed a removal efficiency of 160 mg g−1 for Congo red.33 Meanwhile, Wang et al. synthesized urchin-like α-FeOOH hollow spheres as an adsorbent. Their structural formation is illustrated in Fig. 3a. First, an Fe(II)–glycerol complex is formed by Fe(II) ions mixing with glycerol molecules. Then, the complex adsorbs Fe(II) for the further growth of FeOOH crystals. Finally, they form hollow spheres. The SEM and TEM images in Fig. 3b confirm the assembled hollow spherical NPs, which could achieve a high adsorption capacity of 275 mg g−1 for congo red, and also showed a removal capacity of 58 mg g−1 for As(V) and 80 mg g−1 for Pb(II).34

(c) SEM and TEM images of the Fe(OH)3@cellulose HNFs. (d) Pictures of the flexible Fe(OH)3@cellulose HNF membrane with the filtration device (reprinted from ref. 34 and 35.) 
In addition to its use in conventional adsorption, the hollow structure could also be made into a flexible membrane for water treatment. Fig. 3c shows the SEM and TEM images of the Fe(OH)3@cellulose hollow nanofibers (HNFs) with a typical one-dimensional (1D) hollow structure.35 The obtained membrane could be bent and twisted without any cracks (Fig. 3d). When cut into desired shapes, they could be used in batch water purification.
To enrich the adsorbing active sites, functional groups are usually introduced to modify adsorbents. For instance, Fe3O4@NH2@ poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) core/shell composites were synthesized by a chemical crosslinking reaction. The adsorbent exhibited a higher Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of 256.0 mg g−1 for ARS, and 242.4 mg g−1 for MO than the sample without PEI modification (adsorption capacity of 37.2 mg g−1 for ARS, and 30.6 mg g−1 for MO).36 Liu et al. synthesized Fe3O4/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers via an electrospinning and solvothermal method with the maximum adsorption capacity of 257.07 mg g−1 for tetracycline (TC), which may be due to the interaction between TC and Fe3O4/PAN.37


3.1.2. Photocatalytic method. 
Photocatalytic degradation is a photochemical reaction with the assistance of sunlight or simulated solar light and nanocatalysts. Thus, it is key to improve the catalytic efficiency of photoelectrodes. Recently, iron triad nanomaterials have attracted much attention as ideal photocatalysts due to their low cost, environmental benignity, magnetic recovery, and other advantages.
Photocatalytic degradation combed with electrocatalysis can result in the removal of organic pollutants and generation of hydrogen simultaneously. For example, Zeng et al. prepared a highly stable α-Fe2O3 thin film by electrodeposition, which was used for photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting and the degradation of methylene blue (MB).38 The degradation was carried out using a three-electrode system under neutral conditions. The optimized film showed a stable PEC water oxidation current of around 1.35 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5 irradiation.
Kang et al. synthesized Cu–Fe2O3/Fe)@C NPs to degrade MB which had the advantage of magnetic recovery.39 Under UV-visible light irradiation for 4 h, MB was photocatalytically degraded (>90%) by (Cu–Fe2O3/Fe)@C, which provides a cost-effective way to photocatalytically degrade organic pollutants using solar energy. In addition, Pradhan et al. combined α-Fe2O3 with grained RGO and prepared a graphene-based metal oxide semiconductor photocatalyst through a simple hydrothermal method.40 Several types of photocatalysts were obtained by adjusting the quantity of RGO in the composite, which were separately added to 200 mL of 10 ppm phenol solution under visible light irradiation for 2 h. The sample 5GFO (5 wt% RGO-loaded α-Fe2O3) resulted in 67% phenol degradation. Its photocatalytic activity was 4-fold higher than pure Fe2O3, which confirmed that the addition of RGO greatly improved the photocatalytic performance of the α-Fe2O3 nanorods.
Metal organic frameworks (MOF) are another type of typical material with high specific surface areas and rich pores used in photocatalysis. For example, Zhang et al. synthesized a magnetic recyclable photocatalyst Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) based on a core–shell MOF for the decolorization of MB.41
The structure is illustrated in Fig. 4a as well as the structure of the MOF. Fig. 4b and c show the SEM and TEM images of the dispersed core–shell particles, respectively. In the TEM image, the core–shell structure can be clearly observed, in which the magnetic Fe3O4 cores are coated by MOF shells. Fig. 4d shows that the degradation rate could reach 99% in 45 min with a small amount of H2O2 under UV irradiation, even up to 99% MB in 200 min under visible light.

(d) Degradation curves of Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) on MB under UV-vis light (black curve) and visible light (red curve). The inset shows the color change in the solution with magnetic separation (reprinted from ref. 41.) 
Instead of MOF, some other inorganic semiconductor materials could be used to coat magnetic cores. For instance, Wu et al. successfully fabricated α-Fe2O3/ZnO, spindle-like heterozygous NPs, with the good optical properties of ZnO and the α-Fe2O3 composite.42 The thickness of the ZnO layers could be adjusted by changing the quantity of the zinc precursor. The synergistic effect between the narrow and wide band gap semiconductors and the effective electron-hole separation from the α-Fe2O3/ZnO interfaces greatly improved its photocatalytic degradation properties for Rhodamine B (RhB).


3.1.3. Fenton method. 
Fenton reagents include an oxidation system made up of Fe2+ and H2O2, which interact to form hydroxyl radicals with strong oxidizing ability. These active radicals are capable of degrading most organic compounds and transforming them into harmless products, e.g. CO2, water, and inorganic salts. The occurrence of hydroxyl radicals can be described by the Haber–Weiss equation, Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + OH− + ˙OH(hydroxyl radical)(1)
Wang et al. used the Fenton process and Fe(II)-activated persulfate to degrade trimethoprim in aqueous solution.43 They found that Fenton's reagent could almost completely degrade 0.05 mM trimethoprim, whereas the degradation efficiency of Fe(II)-activated persulfate was only 73.4%. This confirms that the Fenton process is an efficient way to remove organic contaminants. Thus, a series of Fenton-based methods have been developed to degrade organic pollutants. For example, Chong et al. successfully synthesized FeCeOx NPs via an ultrasonic impregnation method and applied them in diclofenac removal during the heterogeneous Fenton process.44 In the presence of H2O2, the removal efficiency of diclofenac (82%) was greatly improved with FeCeOx compared to that without H2O2 (54%), which could be ascribed to the Fenton-like system (FeCeOx–H2O2). The kinetics of the FeCeOx-catalyzed H2O2 process involved adsorption-dominating and degradation-dominating stages. The surface cerium and iron sites and the oxygen vacancies in the FeCeOx catalyst might play an important role in H2O2 decomposition and active species generation.
For some difficult-to-degrade organic pollutants, electric-Fenton and photo-Fenton processes have been developed from the pure Fenton method. Ding et al. designed an electrochemical/electro-Fenton oxidation (EC/EF) system to degrade atrazine using boron-doped diamond (BDD) and Fe@Fe2O3 core–shell nanowire loaded active carbon fiber (Fe@Fe2O3/ACF) as the anode and cathode, respectively.45 An active species trapping experiment revealed that Fe@Fe2O3 could activate molecular oxygen to produce more ˙OH through Fenton reaction, which favored the degradation of atrazine. As demonstrated by the experimental results, the EC/EF system could realize 100% atrazine degradation within 60 min with a high total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency (87.4%).
As shown in Fig. 5a, Shi et al. synthesized yolk–shell structured Fe3O4@void@CdS nanoparticles (NPs) through a coating-etching process with the intermediate Fe3O4@SiO2.46Fig. 5b and c show the core–shell Fe3O4@void@CdS NPs are about 200 nm in diameter with the thickness of the CdS shell of about 15 nm and the Fe3O4 cores of about 100 nm, which verify the successful synthesis of the yolk–shell structure. They used MB as a model pollutant under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm), and obtained an approximately 90% degradation rate within 5 min in the presence of H2O2 (Fig. 5d). Notably, no MB was detected after 10 min in the presence of 0.2 g L−1 of Fe3O4@void@CdS, which demonstrates its excellent degradation activity.

3.2. Treatment of inorganic pollutants
There are some general methods to treat inorganic contaminants such as chemical precipitation, ion exchange, membrane filtration and electrodialysis.47 According to the classification of inorganic pollutants, inorganic pollutants include various toxic metals and their oxides, acids, alkalis, salts, sulfides and halides. Among them, sulfur, nitrogen and carbon oxides are the main atmospheric inorganic pollutants. Heavy metals such as Pb(II), Cd(II), Hg(II), Cr(VI), and Cu(II) can enter the air, water and soil, transform in plants and animals, and even accumulate in the human body through the food chain.48 According to the classification of inorganic pollutants, we introduce the treatment of inorganic pollutants by pollutant type, where the inspiring research to date is summarized.

3.2.1. Treatment of heavy metal ions. 
Chemical precipitation, ion exchange, membrane filtration and electrochemical methods are some conventional methods to remove heavy metals from wastewater, but most of them can only remove heavy metal ions at high concentrations. As a simple, low-cost, and flexible method, the adsorption method has been widely used in the removal of metal ions even at low concentrations (1–20 mg L−1). Thus, it is necessary to develop various high-efficient nano-adsorbents.
Researchers tend to use polymers to cap metal oxides to improve the adsorption properties towards metal ions. For instance, Chávez-Guajardo et al. synthesized polypyrrole/maghemite (PPY/γ-Fe2O3) and polyaniline/maghemite (PANI/γ-Fe2O3) magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) through the emulsion polymerization of pyrrole or aniline.49 The qe of PPY/γ-Fe2O3 MNCs for Cr(VI) and Cu(II) were 209 and 171 mg g−1, while that for PANI/γ-Fe2O3 MNCs was 196 and 107 mg g−1, respectively. The differences could be because the relative amount of polymer was slightly higher in PPY/γ-Fe2O3 than in the PANI/γ-Fe2O3 MNCs. Furthermore, these two types of MNCs could be recycled and used in (at least) 4 adsorption cycles without significant loss in their adsorption capacities, which show their great potential as magnetic adsorbents for the removal of Cr(VI) and Cu(II) ions from aqueous solutions.
Another type of organic material, cellulose, was used to cap magnetic NPs, forming a three-dimensional (3D) γ-Fe2O3@cellulose aerogel (γ-Fe2O3@CA) by chemical coprecipitation, as illustrated in Fig. 6a.50 The contents of γ-Fe2O3 could be roughly adjusted to be 14.1% in γ-Fe2O3@CA-001, 26.2% in γ-Fe2O3@CA-005, and 34.1% in γ-Fe2O3@CA-01. Fig. 6b shows the adsorption isotherms of Cr(VI) on pure cellulose (PCA), γ-Fe2O3@CA-001, γ-Fe2O3@CA-005, and γ-Fe2O3@CA-01, which were obtained with different initial concentrations of Cr(VI) ranging from 10 to 100 mg L−1. The maximum adsorption capacity was 10.2 mg g−1 by γ-Fe2O3@CA-01, which was better than that with the other composites. Fig. 6c shows that the experimental data fit the Langmuir adsorption model well with an R2 of 0.9992 for PCA, 0.9993 for γ-Fe2O3@CA-001, 0.9989 for γ-Fe2O3@CA-005, and 0.9997 for γ-Fe2O3@CA-01, which confirms that the adsorption tends to monolayer adsorption.

In addition to γ-Fe2O3 NPs, Fe and Fe3O4 NPs are also widely used as cores in the field of heavy metal adsorption. Zhuang et al. fabricated a porous carbon-encapsulated iron (Fe@PC) composite to remove 99.5% Cr(VI) from simulated wastewater at a low concentration of 5.00 mg L−1, and the concentration of Cr(VI) that could be degraded was as low as 0.02 mg L−1.51 Wang et al. fabricated MFe2O4 (M = Mn or Co)–MoS–carbon dot (CD) nanohybrid composites with excellent Pb(II) removal ability. It could also decrease Pb(II) from 500 μg L−1 to the ppb level, even reaching the standard for drinking water recommended by the WHO.52
These adsorbents can be easily collected from solution due to their magnetic properties. Nickel can also be used due to its magnetic properties. Cao et al. obtained Ni/α-Ni(OH)2 porous superstructures using NaBH4 as a reducing agent.53 NaBH4 can reduce Ni(II) ions to produce Ni cores. Meanwhile, it can also react with water to produce BO2− ions, which are further hydrolyzed to OH−, forming the final product Ni/α-Ni(OH)2. The as-prepared adsorbent possessed a high specific surface area of 114 m2 g−1, and showed selective adsorption of Pb(II) and Cu(II) from a mixture containing Pb(II), Cd(II) and Cu(II). The Pb(II) content decreased from 10 to 4.84 mg L−1 within 30 min. That means 51.6% of Pb(II) was removed from the mixed solution within 30 min. Undoubtedly, the adsorbent could also be easily separated from water due to its magnetic core.


3.2.2. Treatment of other inorganic pollutants. 
Besides these heavy metal pollutants, nitrates and bromates are major inorganic pollutants. Excessive levels of nitrate in drinking water can cause a variety of health problems, such as methemoglobinemia, diabetes, and liver damage. Thus they pose a threat to human health. Bromate often occurs as a by-product from the disinfection of drinking water with ozone. Due to its carcinogenicity, WHO recommends that its maximum contaminant level (MCL) in drinking water should not exceed 10 mg L−1. Thus, many scientists focus on solving these problems. The main treatments for nitrate and bromate include reverse osmosis, biological denitrification and ion exchange.54 However, these methods have the disadvantage of incomplete conversion of nitrates to harmless compounds, which requires further treatment. The catalytic reduction process has been considered as one of the most promising methods to treat nitrate due to its high-efficient and complete degradation.55 For example, Sun et al. designed and synthesized a series of core–shell composites including Fe3O4@SiO2/Pd, Fe3O4@PMAA/Pd, and Fe3O4@C/Pd to catalyze the reduction of nitrite.56 Compared with the Fe3O4/Pd catalyst without shell protection, the coated catalysts with shells of C or SiO2 showed enhanced performances. After 2 h, the conversion ratio of nitrite was only 10.7% for Fe3O4/Pd, but 100% for Fe3O4@SiO2/Pd, 89.2% for Fe3O4@C/Pd and 65.0% for Fe3O4@PMAA/Pd. Considering the catalytic hydrogenation upon treating bromate under mild conditions, their team also prepared a superparamagnetic Pd/Fe3O4 catalyst, which was used to reduce BrO3− to Br−.57 For an initial BrO3− concentration of 50 ppm, it showed a conversion ratio of about 100%, which demonstrated the important role of Pd/Fe3O4 catalysts in the catalytic reduction of bromate. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the catalyst showed good dispersibility, and by application of an external magnetic field, it could be quickly separated from the water, which is a recyclable advantage.
As one type of main gas pollutant, CO can lead to catalytic poisoning, resulting in poor energy conversion in fuel cells.58 Li et al. used Fe2O3 NPs as an oxidant to convert CO into CO2 which was assisted by O2 with an increase in temperature and showed higher activity than bulk Fe2O3.59 Some researchers developed Fe-MOF to remove trace CO with unprecedentedly high selectivity for use in CO/H2, CO/N2, and CO/CH4 systems.60 MOFs display significant CO adsorption capacity at very low pressures (1.45 mmol g−1 at 100 μbar), as well as readily reversible CO binding. The Fe(II) centers in the MOF change between low-spin and high-spin states with CO coordination or desorption. The interesting behavior in this porous material has been proven to be suitable for use in gas separation.

4. Recycling of adsorbents and contaminants
The recovery of adsorbents remains challenging in the whole process of contaminant degradation. Due to the magnetic properties of hybrid nanocomposites, the adsorbents can be easily collected through magnetic separation by applying an external magnetic field. Furthermore, the generation of energetic molecules such as hydrogen, methane, and methanol from pollutant degradation has aroused much attention. It is a promising research field to generate new energy and simultaneously remove pollutants. Hence, the following section includes the recycling of adsorbents by magnetic separation and energetic material generation with pollutant degradation.
4.1. Recycling of adsorbents
The recovery and reuse of adsorbents are critical for achieving cost-effective and sustainable water treatment. Although the aforementioned core–shell nanostructured adsorbents have been introduced with magnetic cores, here, we summarize the main components to fabricate such promising nano-adsorbents. The typical nanostructure is composed of a magnetic core (Fe3O4, γ-Fe2O3, Fe, Ni, etc.),28,29,36 protective coating on the core (SiO2, carbon, etc.),45,61 functional groups and organic outer layers (–SO3H, cellulose, PEI, etc.).50,62,63 For example, Shan et al. synthesized a novel adsorbent by grafting poly(1-vinylimidazole) oligomer onto Fe3O4@SiO2 to remove Hg2+ from water.61 Notably, the SiO2 coating could successfully inhibit the dissolution of Fe3O4 in acid environment for Hg2+ removal.
Notably, this type of adsorbent could also be used to remove bacteria, dyes, and inorganic anions besides metal cations.64,65 For instance, Zhang et al. synthesized a Fe3O4–core adsorbent modified by amine groups for the disinfection of pathogens and adsorption of toxic metallic cations and anions.64 Wang et al. prepared a magnetic composite via the co-deposition of polydopamine (PDA) and poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) onto Fe3O4 NPs, which presented strong alkali resistance (pH = 13) and efficient selective adsorption of anionic dyes.65
To guarantee the efficiency of magnetic collection, magnetic characterization of these adsorbents is necessary. For example, Chen et al. using mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane (MPTS) to coat Fe3O4, which then acted as a cross-linker to bridge 2-acrylamide-2-methylpro panesulfonic acid (AMPS) to form Fe3O4 sulfonated magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4–SO3H MNPs, Fig. 7a). The saturation magnetization value for the Fe3O4–SO3H MNPs was 69.0 emu g−1, which was slightly lower than the value of 80.3 emu g−1 for the Fe3O4 NPs (Fig. 7b). However, Fe3O4–SO3H still maintained relatively high magnetism after modification with quick magnetic separation (the inset of Fig. 7b). After collection, the Fe3O4–SO3H MNPs were reused by dispersing them in 1% HCl solution. This adsorbent showed excellent removal efficiency towards Pb(II) and Cd(II) after 10 cycles through magnetic collection and washing with dilute HCl (Fig. 7c).62 Obviously, it is important to determine the optimal thickness of organic coatings to achieve considerable adsorption capacity and the magnetic separation.

(b) Magnetic hysteresis loops of Fe3O4 and the Fe3O4–SO3H MNPs with a photograph of the sample before and after magnetic separation inserted. (c) Pb(II) and Cd(II) removal efficiency of the Fe3O4–SO3H MNPs after ten cycles with an initial concentration of 10 mg L−1 (reprinted from ref. 64.) 
4.2. Energy generation from contaminants
For organic pollutants, the general degradation methods include electrocatalytic (EC) and PEC methods. On the one hand, organic macromolecules can be oxidized into energetic molecules, such as ethanol, methanol and methane. On the other hand, hydrogen is obtained at the negative electrode due to water splitting along with the degradation of organic pollutants. As is known, hydrogen, which is an abundant zero-emission fuel, is considered as a promising candidate to replace fossil fuels in the future.
Taking urea as an example, due to its electrolysis voltage of 0.37 V, which is much smaller than 1.23 V for water electrolysis under standard conditions, the electrolysis method has been proven to be an effective technology to remedy urea-rich wastewater.
A series of iron triad nanomaterials have been developed as catalysts towards urea oxidation reaction (UOR) at the anode and hydrogen generation at the cathode.65,66 Sun et al. prepared nickel phosphide nanoflake arrays grown on carbon cloth (Ni2P NF/CC) as a 3D catalyst electrode for UOR (Fig. 8).67 Based on the precursor of NiO NF/CC (Fig. 8a and b), Ni2P NF/CC was obtained after phosphorization. Both the EDX elemental mapping (Fig. 8e) and XRD patterns (Fig. 8f) confirmed the components of the electrode. Furthermore, Ni2P almost retained the morphology of the precursor (Fig. 8c and d). Utilizing Ni2P NF/CC as the cathode for the HER and anode for the UOR (Ni2P NF/CC‖Ni2P NF/CC), a two-electrode electrolyzer for electrochemical hydrogen generation was constructed, which exhibited a superior performance with the requirement of a cell voltage of 1.35 V to attain 50 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea (Fig. 8g). In comparison, the full water splitting electrolyzer using Ni2P NF/CC as both the cathode and anode demanded a much larger voltage of 1.93 V to afford 50 mA cm−2. The generated H2 at the cathode roughly matched the calculated value based on the passed charge, which suggested a nearly 100% faradaic efficiency (Fig. 8h). Obviously, the Ni2P nano-arrays not only promoted urea electrolysis, but also produced considerable hydrogen fuel.

(g) Polarization curves for the Ni2P NF/CC‖Ni2P NF/CC couple in 1.0 M KOH with and without 0.5 M urea at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. (h) Amount of H2 theoretically calculated and experimentally measured vs. time for the Ni2P NF/CC cathode (reprinted from ref. 67.) 
Some other iron triad nanomaterials, such as NiMoO4·xH2O nanosheets on Ni foam and MnO2/MnCo2O4/Ni core–shell nanomaterials, have also been applied in urea degradation and hydrogen generation with low energy consumption.68,69 Some iron triad compounds show EC or PEC performances towards various organic pollutants and thus are potential candidates as optimal electrodes for pollutant degradation by the EC or PEC method.
5. Conclusions and prospects
A series of iron triad nanomaterials, especially magnetic Fe3O4 and γ-Fe2O3 NPs, are involved in the field of environmental treatment, which covers three main parts: pollutant detection, pollutant degradation, and nano-adsorbents recycle and contaminant reuse. These magnetic NPs often serve as cores to develop core–shell hybrid composites by modification with functional groups, fluorescent molecules, or polymers. Due to their controllable nano-size, these functional core–shell nanocomposites have a large specific surface area, which is beneficial for pollutant capture, adsorption, and detection. Thus, sensors based on these composites show low detection limits and high sensitivity, while the fabricated nano-adsorbents show high adsorption capacity and fast adsorption rates. Moreover, their magnetic cores are helpful for recycling these active nanomaterials from sensors and adsorbents with the assistance of an external magnetic field.
Notably, as one of the most effective methods, Fenton catalytic oxidation techniques have been widely used to remove organic contaminants by the addition of iron and iron oxides NPs. After degradation, wastewater even can be fully oxidized into CO2 and H2O with no secondary pollution and low energy consumption under mild reaction conditions. In addition, a series of iron triad compounds show potential application in organic pollutant degradation by the EC and PEC methods due to their excellent catalytic performances. The EC and PEC routes can generate energetic molecules of hydrogen at the cathode while oxidizing pollutants to safer components at the anode simultaneously.
Although iron triad nanomaterials show a wide range of applications in environmental protection and remediation with the advantages of high efficiency, low cost, and environmental benignity, there still exists many problems to be solved to transform laboratory experimental studies into large-scale industrial application.
(i) These NPs tend to aggregate to reduce their high surface free energy and remain stable, which decreases their specific surface area, and thus decrease their activities.
(ii) A dilemma with the use of NPs in wastewater treatment is their size. Their small particle size contributes to their better removal ability and higher reactivity; however, this might lead to potential toxicological effects on the human body and other living organisms. This dispute on nanomaterials in the environmental field needs further study and verification.
(iii) The fabrication of typical core–shell structures (functional groups or polymers coating magnetic NPs) seems too difficult for large-scale production. Thus, it is necessary to determine the cost of their fabrication. The simple, flexible, and large-scale production of such core–shell nanocomposites with high quality remains a big challenge. Besides, the recycling stability and reusability of these composites also need to be considered in improving cost.

Environmental significance
Nowadays, the diversity in environmental pollution has caused the treatment of different types of pollutants much more difficult. As a low-cost chemical, iron triad nanomaterials have been widely used to treat various types of pollutants including both inorganic and organic pollutants, which involves their detection, degradation, and recycling. Most importantly, their unique magnetic properties can make the separation and recycling of pollutants easier, and their electrocatalytic properties can convert pollutants into economic chemical raw materials.
