A series of new PDI acceptor molecules are built to match each designed donor in terms of frontier molecular orbital energy levels by tuning substituents at P1 and P2 positions of PDI1. The designed donors consist of a central electron donor fragment benzodithiophene (DF), electron accepting fragments (A1 to A5) and terfuran and ethynyl-terfuran bridges (B1 and B2 respectively). The absorption bands of the designed donors based on TD-DFT not only cover the visible region but also extend to the infrared region of the spectrum. The donor fragment DF and multibranched spacers B1 and B2 are responsible for absorption in short and middle wavelength regions while the acceptor fragments contribute to the middle and long wavelength regions of the spectrum. In addition, PDIs also exhibit complementary absorptions in the visible range of the solar spectrum. Among designed donors, D1 exhibits ideal lowest band gap, FMO energy levels and exclusive broadest absorption because of the strongest electron withdrawing fragment. The lower λe values as compared to λh illustrate that these five donors would be favorable for electron transfer. The carrier mobility of D1 in the crystalline state has been predicted using the P21/c space group. D1 displays higher carrier mobility for μe = 2.00 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh = 1.7 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. The calculated Voc of D1 is 1.02 V. The designed donors and PDI acceptors are suitable and recommended for high performance solar cell devices.IntroductionSolar energy is the most promising alternative above all renewable energy resources through the development of efficient and economical photovoltaic devices.1–3 The main focus of organic solar cell research is on polymers and small molecules, because of their attractive features like low-cost, light-weight and large area for fabrication on flexible substrates.4,5 In particular, the potential advantages of small molecules over conjugated polymer counterparts in terms of defined molecular structure, simpler purification, definite molecular weight and superior batch-to-batch reproducibility are more attractive for organic solar cells (OSCs).6,7 Among the small molecular materials for OSCs, a novel class of X8,9 or star10,11 shaped donor π-conjugated bridge-acceptor molecules because of their high purity and chemically well-defined structures are receiving more attention. Previous studies have shown device open circuit voltage (Voc) scales with the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy of the acceptor.12 The power conversion efficiency (PCE or η) of solar cell devices is simply the ratio of power output (Pout) vs. power input (Pin), the latter is dependent upon the incident light flux (l0) and the former indicates the properties of the device itself (eqn (1)); namely the short-circuit current (Jsc), Voc and fill-factor (FF).13 (1)In order to improve the efficiency of organic solar cells, an ideal donor must possess a lower HOMO to increase Voc, since the difference of energy between the HOMO of the donor and the lowest LUMO of the acceptor is directly related to Voc. Further, it must have a lower HOMO–LUMO gap to harvest more sunlight, which also results in higher short circuit current density (Jsc). Moreover, strong and broad absorption encompassing both the visible and the near-infrared (NIR) regions of the solar spectrum and high charge carrier mobility is also necessary.14,15Previously our group reported a strategy9 to design novel donor molecules, using double overlapping wave band theory for broad and intensive absorption in the visible and NIR regions of the solar spectrum. For this strategy, the basic building blocks required are: the electron-rich multibranched donor fragment16 (DF), the electron-excessive π-bridges17 (B1 and B2) and the electron-deficient fragment18 (A). To this end, the overlapping absorption spectra of designed donors are the combination of π–π* absorption bands which include the short and middle (SM) wavelength regions and push–pull anisotropic intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)19 absorption bands between donor and acceptor fragments which cover the middle and long (ML) wavelength spectral range. This can be obtained by building an anisotropic planner compound. Hence, in the present paper, new anisotropic X-shaped donor compounds with planar conformations are designed by linking three basic units i.e., (A-B1)2–DF–(B2-A)2 as shown in Scheme 1, where DF is benzo[1,2,-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), the donor fragment (central core) that exhibits outstanding photovoltaic properties for applications in OSCs like narrow HOMO–LUMO band gap, planar structure, charge carrier mobility, and broad absorption. In particular, the fused benzene associated with the dithiophene rings provides multiple-π-conjugated branches.20,21 B1 and B2 are different electron-excessive π-spacer chains (terfuran and ethynyl-terfuran respectively), which can serve both as a part of the light absorbing chromophore and a pathway for transporting charges. Furthermore, the use of furan reduces the use of long alkyl chain substituents for solubility of donor molecules in common organic solvents as it also contributes to overall solubility of the resultant final molecules.22 Actually furan incorporation helps in solubility by getting approach to that parts of structure otherwise which are not soluble.23 It might be the difference of the atomic radius of oxygen and its electronegativity as compared to sulphur of thiophene.24 Finally the optical and electronic properties of furan and thiophene containing conjugated molecules are almost the same.25 Similarly more electronegative oxygen atoms of furan help to lower the HOMO energy level of the donor compound, which in turn increases Voc.14,26,27 A triple bond insertion assists in the fine-tuning of molecular planar conformations by lowering the steric hindrance between the arms and the core and broadening the absorption spectra.28 End groups A act as acceptor fragments and have more electron deficient units and therefore they are able to reduce the energy gap (Eg) of final donors compounds.29 The multibranched π-conjugated B12–DF–B22 is considered as the donor fragment of the molecule. B12–DF–B22 itself is responsible for the strong and broad absorptions in the SM wavelength region of the solar spectrum, while the anisotropic ICT between the π-conjugated B12–DF–B22 and the A fragments in the ML region of spectrum. Scheme 1  Schematic design of the anisotropic (A-B1)2–DF–(B2-A)2 donor molecules. H is for HOMO and L is for the LUMO energy level. Eg is the energy gap of donor molecules, Ed is the energy difference between LUMOs of donor and acceptor molecules, while Eb is the difference of energy levels between HOMO of donor and LUMO of acceptor molecules. Further, suitable acceptor molecules i.e., perylenediimide (PDI)30,31 derivatives have been reported here for newly designed solar cell donors in terms of matched energy levels. New derivatives of PDIs (PDI3, PDI4, PDI5 and PDI7) are built by substituting electron donating and withdrawing groups at P1 and P2 positions of PDI1 (Scheme 2). We believe that our newly designed donor and acceptor molecules for solar cells seem to possess the following advantageous features. Firstly, use of different acceptor fragments resulted in absorption over a sufficiently broad wavelength range. Secondly, use of highly conjugated systems can lead to attain small Eg and broader absorption over the entire visible and NIR regions of the solar spectrum. Thirdly, the planarity of a conjugated system is pivotal to achieve higher ICT. Fourthly, geometrical-adjustment ability of selected building units is a good approach towards lowering the reorganization energies values of corresponding final compounds. Finally, new PDI derivatives are also liable for future practical applications. Scheme 2  Chemical structures of the five donors (D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5) and acceptor PDIs (PDI1–PDI8) while acceptor fragments (A) are arranged based on their decreasing electron withdrawing strength. Theoretical methodologyThe ground state geometries including all neutral, cation, and anion molecules and properties of all organic donor molecules were obtained by utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations with B3LYP functional.32,33 All calculations have been carried out by Gaussian 09 program package.34 The 6-31G (d) split valence polarized basis set was used for all calculations, as it has produced the most suitable results for geometries and electronic properties.35,36 In addition, to ensure uniformity in the calculation, we performed DFT and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations, also using other hybrid functionals such as PBE0 and B3P8637 and long range functionals WB97XD and CAM-B3LYP38 to compare with available experimental data (ESI†). Most approximate results were obtained for both geometrical parameters and the maximum absorption wavelength with B3LYP functional. It is worth mentioning that long range functionals are underestimated especially in terms of absorption properties. Frequency calculations, using the same methods as those for geometry optimizations, were performed for each of the obtained structures. All real frequencies have confirmed the presence of a local minimum. The density of states (DOS) was computed by the PyMOlyze program. The UV–Vis spectra of all the compounds were investigated with TD-B3LYP/6-31G (d), based on the optimized geometries obtained by the B3LYP/6-31G (d) method in the gas phase. GaussSum 2.2.0 was applied to yield simulated spectra. To analyze MO analysis results for the charge transfer in the excited transition states we performed natural transition orbital (NBO) analysis using B3LYP functional and 6-31G (d) basis set. Although long range functionals (CAM-B3LYP, Wb97xd, LC-PBE, LC-BLYP, etc.) are well known to study electron transfer from donor to acceptor these methods are also more useful for large systems.39 We employed B3LYP functional also for NTO analysis as a long range functional underestimated especially in terms of absorption properties (as described in the ESI†). The NTO analysis has been carried out by a method as described by Martin.40The B3LYP/6-31G (d) method was also used to optimize and calculate charge transport properties of the PDI derivatives. In order to save calculation time, the molecular structures were simplified by replacing the dodecyloxy group with a methoxyl group and cyclohexyl groups with methyl groups. Usually, the charge transport in the organic solid can be regarded as a hopping process, which can be described by the Marcus theory of electron transfer.41 For self-exchange transfer reaction, the driven force, i.e., the free energy difference (ΔG°) is approximately taken as zero in the transfer. Hence, the transfer rate constant (K) is represented as: (2)where V is the intermolecular transfer integral, T is the temperature, kB represents the Boltzmann constant and λ is the reorganization energy. It can be deduced from eqn (2) that charge transfer rates are dependent mainly on two parameters: (i) λ, which should be small and (ii) V, which should be maximized for higher transport. So, the reorganization energies for electron (λe) and hole (λh) of the molecules were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G (d)42 level based on single point energy calculations. Further, B3LYP with temperate basis sets like 6-31G (d) provides a good description of the extent of electron transfer and the energies of excited states. Larger basis sets, especially those containing diffuse functions, may overestimate the extent of electron transfer, because of the self-interaction problem of DFT.43 The reorganization energy consists of two parts, external reorganization energy (λext), which represents the effect of polarized medium in the surrounding medium and internal reorganization energy (λint), which is the measure of a change in the molecular geometry. The predicted values of λext are even smaller than their internal parts in pure organic condensed phases. In addition, λint and the charge transfer rate have a clear correlation.44 Moreover, donors are designed for solar solid film phases, which have lower dielectric constants as well.45 So our prime focus was λint calculation without taking into account the environmental changes and relaxation. λe and λh can be expressed by eqn (3) and (4):  λe = [E−0 − E−] + [E0− − E0](3) λh = [E+0 − E+] + [E0+ − E0](4)where E+0 (E−0) is the energy of the cation (anion) calculated based on the optimized structure of the neutral molecule. Likewise, E+ (E−) stands for the energy of the cation (anion) calculated based on the optimized cation (anion) structure, and E0+ (E0−) corresponds to the energy of the neutral molecule calculated at the cationic (anionic) state. Lastly, E0 is the energy of the neutral molecule at the ground state. To determine transfer integrals, single-crystal structures have been used. The module polymorph embedded in the Materials Studio was used to predict the molecular crystal structures of the donor. Then all the nearest possible neighboring intermolecular hopping pathways were generated. The pw91pw91 functional was used to calculate the transfer integrals.46 For carrier mobility, the Einstein relationship is as: μ = eD/kBT(5)where e is the electronic charge, if the charge motion is simulated as a homogeneous random walk, then diffusion constant can be evaluated as:47 (6)whereas d is the intermolecular center-to-center distance and n = 3 is the spatial dimension. The hopping time between two adjacent molecules is the reciprocal of the rate constant i.e., 1/k. The probability for a specific hopping route is: It is also known as a 3-D averaged diffusion process. From eqn (6) it is clear that the mobility has a direct relationship with the electron transfer rate. In this mechanism, it has been supposed that the localized electron can only hop between adjacent molecules, in sharp contrast to the band-like picture, where the electron is delocalized in several molecules. Yang et al. have proposed that it offers more accurate results in computations;48 thus, we used this direct method, which has been proven to yield accurate and satisfactory results. The electronic coupling for electron–hole transfer in this scheme can be written as; Vij = 〈Φ01|F0|Φ02〉(7)where Vij is the transfer integral, Φ01 andΦ02 represent the unperturbed frontier orbitals of molecules 1 and 2 respectively in the dimer. F0 is the Kohn–Sham–Fock operator of the dimer obtained with the unperturbed density matrix, which is calculated by the molecular orbitals and density matrix of the two individual molecules and can be evaluated separately using the standard self-consistent field procedure.49 The potential surfaces have been evaluated and plotted to access their stability at the B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) level using Molekel 4.3.Results and discussionSelection of building blocksThe schematic design and chemical structural sketches of the building blocks of our newly designed X-shaped donors are shown in Schemes 1 and 2 respectively. Here, DF and π-bridges B1 and B2 act together as the donor fragment B12–DF–B22 of the designed donor compounds, while A1 to A5 are acceptor fragments. To check the reliability of these building blocks for the proposed strategy, we first conducted quantum calculations on DF, B12–DF–B22 and seven A fragments to determine their energy levels.Fig. 1 shows the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these building blocks providing a supreme match of donor–acceptor fragments for designed organic solar cell donor candidates. Addition of B1 and B2 into DF results in a B12–DF–B22 fragment. This B12–DF–B22 fragment has lowered HOMO, LUMO and Eg than DF due to higher conjugation. Hence, it argues convincingly that B12–DF–B22 acts as a donor fragment due to higher HOMO and LUMO levels as compared to those of A fragments. As is well known that electron withdrawing strength is inversely proportional to the LUMO energy level, so it can be clearly understood by observing Fig. 1 which demonstrates that LUMO levels consecutively increase in energy from A1 to A7 i.e. A1 < A2 < A3 < A4 < A5 < A6 < A7, while electron withdrawing strength decreases from A1 to A7 i.e. A1 > A2 > A3 > A4 > A5 > A6 > A7. In this respect, benzene insertion into pyrazine (in the case of A6) causes the HOMO energy level to move up by 0.13 eV, but LUMO to move down by 0.51 eV as compared to A7. In addition, replacement of the six membered pyrazine ring (A6) with a five membered oxadiazole ring (A5) has enhanced the electron withdrawing strength on the one hand and lowered both HOMO and LUMO levels on the other hand. These findings are in accordance with previous experimental results.50 Also, the oxadiazole acceptor fragment and the terfuran π-spacer have produced improved results than thiadiazole and thiophene analogues (Table S5†).9 Furthermore, NO2 group substitution leads to a tremendous increase in electron withdrawing capability of acceptor fragments, which results in small Eg molecules. On the basis of these initial quantum calculations, it is found that A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 have both lower HOMO and LUMO levels than the donor fragment B12–DF–B22. It was therefore intended to constitute five X-shaped donor compounds for organic solar cells. These donors were abbreviated as D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5. Once the energy levels of model compounds deemed appropriate for OSC applications, the donors were built to investigate their electronic, absorption and charge transport properties. Fig. 1  Selection of donor and acceptor fragments to build donor molecules based on energy levels. Donor HOMO and LUMO energy levels relative to their fragmentsHerein we report on a detailed analysis which explains the dependence of HOMO and LUMO and Eg of the designed donors relative to their building blocks (donor and acceptor fragments). Moreover, the purpose is to figure out some new fascinating facts by comparing these energy levels of donor compounds (D1–D5) with a donor fragment B12–DF–B22 and acceptors fragments (A1–A5). Fig. 2 presents HOMO and LUMO energies of five donor molecules and their donor–acceptor fragments. From this physical appearance it is clear that HOMO energy levels of the donor compounds are closer in energy to the HOMO of the donor fragment than those of acceptor fragments whereas LUMO energy levels of the donor compounds are closer in energy to LUMOs of acceptor fragments than that of the donor fragment. Hence, it supports the fact that usually HOMO of the donor compound is determined by the donor fragment while LUMO by the acceptor fragment. Further, the detailed comparative analysis showed that there is no more reliable non-linear fit equation relationship between HOMO, LUMO and Eg of all donor molecules and their building units (Fig. S4†). Fig. 2  Comparison of the energy levels of the donor compounds (D1–D5) relative to donor B12–DF–B22 and acceptor A1–A5 fragments. Frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs)The molecular structures of five X-shaped donors in their ground state were fully optimized. The optimized geometries of five donors and B12–DF–B22 fragment with planar conformations are shown in Fig. 3 (Fig. S1a†). The optimized structures also confirm their planar geometries, which facilitate the electrons to be delocalized within the molecule systems via conjugation to increase carrier mobility. The energy level diagrams of HOMO and LUMO of the donor compounds show that HOMO energy levels range from −5.41 to −4.85 eV while LUMO energies range from −3.86 to −2.76 eV (Fig. S2b†). The values for HOMO and LUMO energy levels increase from D1 to D5 except D4, as the electron withdrawing strength of acceptor fragments decreases. D1 and D2 have the lowest HOMO and LUMO energy levels due to the substitution of a NO2 group in A1 and A2. Additionally, HOMO and LUMO energy levels of D1 are lower than D2 as A1 has a five membered oxadiazole ring which is more electron withdrawing than the six membered pyrazine ring of A2. Similar behavior is observed for D3 and D4 due to nitrogen substitution in A3 and A4. The exceptional behavior of D4 as compared to D5 having higher HOMO and LUMO levels can be ascribed by the presence of the pyrazine ring in A4 while an oxadiazole ring in A5. Finally, the order of Eg for the designed donors is: D1 < D2 < D3 < D4 < D5, as with an increase in electron withdrawing strength of their acceptor fragments, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the final donor compounds are becoming lower which result in smaller Eg. Thus, it shows that substitutions of more electron withdrawing components result in lower HOMO, LUMO energies and smaller Eg of the final compounds. Fig. 3  The ground state optimized structures of five X-shaped donors. The FMOs of the D1 are shown in Fig. 6 while for D2, D3, D4 and D5 are displayed in the ESI.† An in-depth analysis of D1 orbitals shows that H and H − 1 are fully delocalized on the central B12–DF–B22 donor fragment, showing π character (here, H represents HOMO and L is for LUMO). H − 2 and H − 3 are also delocalized on central donor fragments, but have minor contribution of electron density from DF and A1 fragments while major contribution is from B1 and B2 (H to H − 3s of D2, D3, D4, D5 show similar behavior). As the LUMOs of D1 are concerned, L and L + 1 are mainly delocalized on acceptor A1 fragments, which also show π character, the same kind of delocalization behavior is observed by L and L + 2 of D2, for L, L + 1, L + 2 and L + 3 of D3, L + 1 and L + 3 of D4 and L + 1 of D5. But in L + 2 of D5, A2 fragments on the end of B1 arms have more contribution than those on B2 arms in terms of electron density, whereas reverse is the case for L + 3. This is due to the rise in energy of LUMO levels from L to L + 3 onward. This localization of HOMO on the donor fragments and of LUMO on acceptor fragments is also helpful for the intensity difference of H–L transitions, which may lead to better overlap of the orbitals and result in broad absorption, while L + 4 and L + 5 are mainly delocalized on the central DF fragment and π-spacers, corresponding to LUMO of the B12–DF–B22 fragment. Similarly L + 4s and L + 5s of D1, D2 and D3 correspond to LUMO of the B12–DF–B22 fragment. The same behavior is observed by L + 5s of both D4 and D5. L + 1 of D2 has major contribution from A2s on the end of B1 arms, while L + 3 has major contribution from A2s on the end of B2 arms. This is also confirmed from the percentage and DOS contributions. Here, the donors D4 and D5 are showing unusual behavior in terms of LUMO delocalization, L and L + 4 of both D4 and D5 are delocalized over the whole molecule. Major contribution is from the DF fragment and minor is from A4s on the end of Bi arms. This is due to higher LUMO energy levels of D4 and D5. In addition, as the electron withdrawing strength of acceptor fragments decreases from D1 to D5, HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the corresponding donor molecules become higher and the overlap between the orbitals is reduced. This results in large Eg compounds.Further analysis of FMOs of D1 in relation to percentage composition and DOS around HOMOs and LUMOs (Fig. 4 and Table S7†) also confirms that acceptor fragments with different electron withdrawing strengths can alter the electron distribution of molecular orbitals (MOs). The B1 and B2 arms have different percentage contributions for HOMO i.e., 6% and 26% respectively, while for LUMO, B1 has 79% and B2 11%. This is additionally clear from DOS of D1. Hence, the evidence verifies that the use of different Bi arms provides the anisotropic pathway for electronic transition. Similarly, the percentage contribution for HOMOs and LUMOs of D2, D3, D4 and D5 from B1 and B2 are provided in the ESI.† In addition, the DOS manifests the energies of all occupied and vacant MOs in these organic donors. The energy range is therefore of significant importance. In the present case, this energy range is between −3 and +3 eV. The DOS of occupied MOs is almost similar for all designed donors, demonstrating that the occupied orbitals are rising from the commonly shared B12–DF–B22 donor fragment. The HOMOs mostly arise from the electron donor fragment, so the excitations within the energy range will result in electron transfer. This is also supported by the difference in DOS of the unoccupied orbitals of designed donors, which show that they belong to particular fragments (A) for each donor compound. Fig. 4  Density of states around HOMO and LUMO for five donor molecules D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5. Absorption propertiesFig. 5 shows simulated absorption spectra of five donors with solar flux. Herein, we have obtained strong, immense, and broad absorption peaks over the whole visible region for all designed donors and over the NIR region of the spectrum especially for D1, D2 and D3, which is astonishing among organic materials for solar cells. Fig. 5  Simulated absorption spectra of five donors D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 and acceptor PDI2 compared with the Solar Flux for AM 1.5G. The trend in increasing values of λmax in the absorption spectra can be attributed to increasing electron withdrawing strength of acceptor fragments. With an increase in electron withdrawing strength of the acceptor fragments, Eg of final donors decreases. Additionally, excitation energy is also inversely proportional to the electron withdrawing strength of acceptor fragments. For example, excitation energy increases with a decrease in electron withdrawing strength from A1–A5 for D1–D5 respectively (Table 1).

To understand the nature of electronic transitions in the different regions, we explored the absorption spectrum of D1 as representative in terms of λabs, ƒ and major assignments associated with electronic transitions (detail information for D2–D4 electronic transition is given in Fig. S2a and S3†).The results from Table 2 demonstrate that the absorption spectrum of D1 exhibits four strong absorptions in the SM wavelength region of the spectrum at 466, 483, 544 and 580 nm which are associated with H → L + 5, H − 1 →L + 5, H − 1 → L + 4 and H → L + 4 electron transitions. These electronic transitions can be ascribed as π–π* transitions of the B12–DF–B22 fragment. In the ML wavelength region, strong absorptions are at 625, 629, 680, 687, 731, 746, 878 and 898 nm which are associated with major H − 3 → L + 2, H − 3 → L + 3, H − 2 → L + 3, H − 2 → L + 2, H − 1 → L + 1, H − 1 → L, H → L + 3 and H → L transitions. Table 2 and Fig. 6 clearly show that these transitions are assigned as push–pull anisotropic ICT between B12–DF–B22 and A1 fragments. It is evidenced that the M wavelength range (500–630 nm) involves both kinds of transitions i.e. π–π* transitions from the B12–DF–B22 fragment and ICT between B12–DF–B22 and A1 fragments. The long-wavelength absorptions are attributed to the ICT process between the B12–DF–B22 fragment and the electron-accepting A1 fragments.

The calculations have also been carried out for comparison purpose of D1 with one of the previously studied compound (X1)9 containing two thiophene analogues in the π-spacer chain, thiadiazole as a part of the acceptor fragment and CN as the electron withdrawing group. We made three changes in D1 forming D1a to compare the effect of furan with the thiophene analogue X1 i.e. (I) use of two furan rings instead of three, (II) CN group substitution with NO2 and (III) use of thiadiazole as a part of A1 instead of oxadiazole. D1a has almost the same Eg and absorption properties like X1. It also proved that the use of furan instead of thiophene as a π-spacer has resulted in more or less the same properties as the thiophene analogue, which is in agreement with previous experimental results.25 However, surprisingly the use of longer π-bridges, overall oxygen substitutions on the acceptor fragment and NO2 group substitution have shown wonderful results, leading to much lower Eg and red shift of 81 nm in the absorption wavelength (for D1). Moreover, the two furan ring containing D1a analogue of X1 instead of three ring containing D1b was blue shifted by 69 nm than that of D1. Hence, the red shift of 12 nm of the terfuran containing D1b as compared to bifuran containing D1a proves that the long π-bridge has enhanced conjugation. Thus, the overall electron withdrawing strength of oxygen substituted moieties and the use of longer π-bridges might lead to lower Eg compound with broad and intense absorption (Table S9†). This comparison also demonstrates that because of these substitutions, D1, D2 and D3 have shown broader absorption peaks which are red shifted more in the NIR in addition to the visible region as compared to those molecules without these substitutions likewise D4 and D5. Thus, the analysis of optical and electronic properties confirms these designed compounds as promising donor materials for organic solar cells, likely due to their low excitation energies and amazing broad absorption over visible and NIR regions of the solar spectrum with intense and strong peaks.Natural transition orbital (NTO) analysisFurther to analyze and confirm the nature of electronic excitations by MO analysis as described above, NTO analysis is carried out for the model compound D1. NTO analysis is a compact orbital representation for the transition density matrix and provides qualitative description of electronic transition. As is well known NTOs provide a much more compact explanation of the excitation instead of just looking at the MOs. The occupied and virtual NTOs are also referred to as “hole” and “electron,” respectively. The “hole” corresponds to the occupied orbitals from which the electron is ejected and the “electron “is related to the virtual orbitals onto which the electron is located. In this regard, electronic transitions can be represented by a couple of hole–electron pairs in the NTO basis which reproduce over 90% of the transition density with an related eigenvalue even for highly mixed transitions in the MO basis.The five excitations with strong intensity are taken into account (Table S10a†). It is notable that the excitation energies of D1 are almost the same as those for the MOs. An NTO analysis of the TDDFT transition density shows that the lowest excited state is of ICT nature with the electron–hole pairs delocalized at the B12–DF–B22 and A1 fragments (Table 2). The lowest transition is clearly described as ψHOMO → ψ′LUMO. Third and fifth excitations correspond to ψHOMO → ψ′LUMO+3 and ψHOMO−1 → ψ′LUMO, respectively. These three excitations are of ICT type with each amplitude of 0.70. These ICT transitions also account for eigenvalues (λi) of more than 97%. The NTO pairs are shown in the ESI† resembling very much the NTOs of the MOs for the D1 molecule (Fig. 6). While last two excitations are of π–π* and ICT nature because of electron–hole pair delocalization over H and H − 1, which are also spread over H + 4 orbitals. This seventeenth π–π* type excited state, from amplitude wise is described as 0.58 (ψHOMO → ψ′LUMO+4) + 0.28 (ψHOMO−3 → ψ′LUMO+3). Finally, the eighteenth π–π* type excited state is described as 0.53 (ψHOMO−1 → ψ′LUMO+4) + 0.44 (ψHOMO−4 → ψ′LUMO+1). Further, NTOs also capture more than 90% of the character of the transition. This λi of >0.90 for a state significantly well describes the dominance of excitation pair accounting for over 90% of the transition. Molecular geometry optimization of each excited state has shown that the state remains the lowest, 1.38 eV above S0. These results are similar to those obtained for MO analysis. The molecular structures of the NTOs of the hole and particle of five excited transitions are given (Fig. S5a†). As expected the hole and electron pairs are mostly located on the B12–DF–B22 and A1 fragments, representing density zones (Fig. S5a†). This finding is consistent in that there is ICT between donor and acceptor fragments of the molecule over the SM wavelength region of the spectrum. On the other hand the density delocalization of electron–hole pairs over donor fragments and whole molecules corresponding to last two excitations states is associated with π–π* type transitions. Hence, NBO analysis also confirmed the nature and type of electronic transition as described by MO analysis. The same kind of behavior was observed for the rest of the donor molecules.Match of optoelectronic properties between donors and acceptorsFor practical application, we present a scheme for an exact match between newly designed donors with suitable acceptor molecules i.e., PDIs, which are potential acceptors for photovoltaic devices. Accordingly, in order to obtain a closer match, we designed some of the derivatives of PDIs (PDI3, PDI4, PDI5 and PDI7) by substituting electron donating and withdrawing groups at P1 and P2 positions of PDI1 (Scheme 2). As expected electron withdrawing groups lower the HOMO and LUMO energy levels while electron donating makes them higher (Table S8†). The calculated results for PDI derivatives are comparable with previous experimental studies.30 The LUMO energy level of the donor must be positioned above the LUMO energy level of the acceptor by at least 0.2–0.3 eV to ensure efficient electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor (Ed in Scheme 1). Fig. 7 shows that PDI2, PDI4, PDI1, PDI3, and PDI8 are the suitable acceptors for our designed donors D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5 respectively, as their Ed values are in the range of 0.23–0.53 eV which ensure efficient electron transfer from donor to acceptor molecules. As well, for all investigated PDIs, HOMO levels are lower than those of D1–D5 by 1.0 eV. To obtain higher Voc of the resulting solar cell, Eb should range between 1.2 and 1.9 eV. For our designed molecules, it ranges from 1.2 to 1.6 eV, which is ideal for attaining higher Voc. Fig. 7 clearly shows that D1 also exhibits ideal HOMO and LUMO energy levels. Such low-lying HOMO levels are essential for achieving large Voc values in photovoltaic devices, as the Voc value is closely related to the energy difference between the HOMO of the electron donor and the LUMO of the electron-acceptor. Voc can be theoretically calculated as:Voc = 1/e [EHOMO (D) − ELUMO (A)] − 0.3 Vwhere e is the elementary charge, 0.3 is an empirical factor, while EHOMO and ELUMO are the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of donor and acceptor. For D1, Voc is 1.02 V. Fig. 7  Molecular orbital energy level diagrams of five designed donors and eight PDI acceptors. Moreover, maximum absorption wavelength of PDIs 507 (PDI1), 522 (PDI2), 548 (PDI3), 540 (PDI4), 583 nm (PDI8) are in agreement with previously studied PDI derivatives.30 Interestingly, absorption spectra of the PDIs are complementary to those of designed donors in the visible range of the spectrum which is helpful for light harvesting (Table S6†). Like this, the electronic and absorption results for PDI derivatives have confirmed them as preferable acceptors for our five newly designed donors in the photovoltaic devices. Therefore, the donor compounds D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5 with PDI2, PDI4, PDI1, PDI3 and PDI8 as the acceptors respectively are suitable for efficient organic solar cells.Reorganization energyFor solar cells, charge transport property of the material has an immense importance, as it determines their performance in electronics applications.51 As eqn (2) confirms this, the parameters of primary importance in hopping transport are λ and V between eight neighboring pathways in the crystalline structure. Generally, lower λ values correspond to large carrier mobility. Table 3 shows λe and λh values. The λe values of designed donors ranging from 0.051 to 0.067 eV are much smaller than that of tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum(III)(Alq3 = 0.276 eV), a typical electron transport material,52 which reveals that their electron transfer rates may be much greater than that of Alq3. Further, the λh values are also smaller than a typical hole transporter53i.e. N,N-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(3-methlphenyl)-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (TPD = 0.290 eV), which range from 0.094 to 110 eV. The careful examination of both λe and λh shows that λe is lower than λh for all designed donors. Therefore, reorganization energy calculations verified these donors to be better electron transport materials than hole transporters. Likewise, it also supports the fact that electron withdrawing fragment substitutions help to increase the electron transfer rate of material, which is consistent with the previous one.54 In addition, comparison of furan and thiophene spacer containing molecules following the same strategy9 shows that the overall former has lower λ values. Thus, after a watchful comparison of optical and electronic properties, it can be derived that PDI2 is an appropriate acceptor for D1, PDI4 for D2, PDI1 for D3, PDI3 for D4 and finally PDI8 for D5 in solar cell applications. Also lower λe and λh values are revealed by an accurate analysis of geometrical parameters like bond length of neutral structure to compare it with ionic forms (cationic and anionic) (Fig. 8). All designed donors retained a planar configuration in the ionic form with slight changes in the C–C, C–N, C–S, and N–S bond lengths. As compared to the neutral structure, in a cationic state these small changes only reside over the B12–D–B22 fragment, while in an anionic state, the changes only reside over A fragments. These bond length differences are not more than 0.013 Å for D1, 0.011 Å for D2–D5 and 0.010 Å for D5, which indicate the best geometry adjustment aptitude. This also provides strong evidence in favor of building blocks of the proposed donors, which have suitable geometry relaxation character and high carrier mobility, resulting in innovative donor molecules with such characteristics.

Drift mobilityTransfer integral is an important parameter which is important for determining charge carrier mobility.55 The value of transfer integrals is also dependent on the relative position of interacting molecules and their FMO distribution patterns.42,56 To obtain quantitative charge transfer properties, in terms of transfer integral and drift mobility, we also carried out calculations in the crystalline state. On the basis of suitable optical and electronic characteristics, we chose D1 as representative to study its charge transport property in the solid state. The crystal structure of D1 was predicted by Materials Studio (Fig. 9). Due to the structural resemblance with previous studies, we conducted a crystal structure prediction analysis with Pbcn, C2/c and P21/c or P21/n space groups however, the crystalline structure showed comparable results for structural parameters with P21/c.57–59 Then, we performed a further geometry optimization by using a combination of Deriding force field60 and Ewald sum methods. Later, we followed the geometry optimization calculations with the Forcite modules. It is a triclinic system with the space group P21 and lattice parameters are a = 46.56 Å, b = 19.52 Å, c = 4.08 Å, α = γ = 90°, and β = 86°. On the basis of the crystal structure of D1, one of the molecules was randomly chosen as a center to diffuse charge. Then, the eight nearest neighboring pathways were identified (Fig. 10). Fig. 9  The predicted super cell structure of D1 along (a) a–b plane, (b) a–c and (c) b–c planes.  Fig. 10  Crystal structure of D1, arrowheads indicating the eight neighboring pathways. The corresponding coupling integrals were calculated for hole and electron. Table 4 shows that pathways 1 and 2 have stronger coupling integrals for both hole and electron. Pathways 5 and 8 also have larger electron coupling integrals than that of hole. These mobility calculations for the D1 crystalline structure show that electron mobility is higher than hole, which is consistent with reorganization energy analysis. By considering both reorganization energy and carrier mobility, it can be concluded that D1 is a better electron transfer material for solar cell devices.

The surfaces are described in terms of total electronic density and produce a color map of the electrostatic potential. This color-coded description of the molecular morphology is very informative for the reactive potential of a molecule. In Fig. 11, electron density maps of all donors are represented by nature and intensity of color. The blue color acts as a region of low charge density (positive charge) and the red color acts as a region of high charge density (negative charge). The green color corresponds to the neutral regions. For D1 and D2, more partial positive charges are located on the carbon atoms over whole molecules, except the end groups of Bi, which are more negatively charged due to higher electron withdrawing A fragments. Stronger electron withdrawing A1 and A2 fragments impart more positive charge on the carbon atoms which render the oxidation difficult and enhance stability. It is convincing that higher stability of D1 and D2 is likely due to the more electron-withdrawing A1 and A2, which is according to previous results.61 In the case of D3, D4 and D5 because of the lack of –NO2 groups more negatively charges are located at the oxygen atoms of furan rings on Bi chains and nitrogen of oxadiazole and pyrazine ring of acceptor fragments. Moreover A3–A5 fragments limit the negative charge on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms and render carbon atoms less positive than those of D1 and D2 due to their less electron withdrawing fragments. Hence, we conclude that D1 and D2 are more stable than D3, D4 and D5. As electron withdrawing strength decreases from A1–A5, it influences the stability of the donors in the same order (D1–D5). Thus it is the strong electron withdrawing strength of oxygen and nitrogen substituents which enhance the stability of designed donors as compared to those carrying less electronegative sulfur and thiophene molecules. Consequently, the electron withdrawing strength of acceptor fragments and the pull–push between donor–acceptor fragments have a pronounced effect on the optical, electronic and stability properties of the designed donors. Fig. 11  Electrostatic surface potentials mapped onto a surface of total electron density for five donor compounds. Regions of higher electron density are shown in red and of lower electron density in blue (values in atomic units). ConclusionsIn summary, we have designed five X-shaped anisotropic donor molecules D1–D5 for organic solar cell devices, following the double overlap band strategy. Also, in order to obtain a closer match, derivatives of PDI (PDI3, PDI4, PDI5 and PDI7) have been built by substituting electron donating and withdrawing groups at P1 and P2 positions of PDI1. These newly designed donors showed lower HOMO, LUMO levels, smaller Eg and higher carrier mobility. The significant constructing units i.e., central donor fragment benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene, anisotropic multi-branched π-spacers terfuran and ethynyl terfuran and the end group acceptor fragments have enhanced the optical and electronic properties of the resulting donors. Because of their suitable FMOs and absorption properties, the designed PDI acceptors are preferable for designed donors. The optical investigations reveal that the central anisotropic multibranched donor B12–DF–B22 fragment is responsible for π–π* absorption in short and middle wavelength regions, while A fragments are responsible in the ML wavelength region of the solar spectrum. With an increase in electron withdrawing strength of acceptor fragments from A1 to A5, there was a consistent decrease in the LUMO energy level of the corresponding donor compounds. There is no non-linear fit relationship between FMOs of the donor molecules and their building blocks. The absorption spectra of D1, D2 and D3 are extended over the NIR region in addition to the visible region of the solar spectrum. Among them D1 shows the broadest absorption wavelength (898 nm). Besides, the comparison of D1 with the previously studied thiophene analogue has shown that the use of furan instead of thiophene as a π-spacer exhibits the same electronic and optical properties. In addition, the significant red shift in absorptions of D1–D3 and smaller Eg than previously studied sulfur and thiophene analogues is likely due to more electron withdrawing oxygen and NO2 group substitutions. Particularly the use of longer π-spacer chains has helped to lower the LUMO energy levels. Therefore, our designed compounds especially D1 to D3 show more red shifts over the NIR region of the spectrum than previously studied compounds following this strategy. NTO analysis is also in agreement with the results of electronic excitations based on MO analysis. The combined analysis of reorganization energy and drift mobility has verified that these five donors would be better electron transporters for solar cell devices. Additionally, Voc of D1 has been calculated to be 1.02 V. All designed donors also retained a planar configuration in the ionic form with slight changes in the C–C, C–N, C–S, and N–S bond lengths, which indicates their best geometry adjustment ability. The MESP results show that electron withdrawing strength of acceptor fragments and the pull–push between donor–acceptor fragments has pronounced effects on the stability properties of the designed donors. The stability decreases from D1 to D5 as the optical gap increases. Consequently, theoretical calculations confirm that our designed donors and acceptors would be suitable for organic photovoltaic devices.AcknowledgementsFinancial support by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21173037 and 21274017) is gratefully acknowledged.ReferencesA.
