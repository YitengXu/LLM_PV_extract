    , Accepted 23rd April 2018First published on 1st May 2018AbstractUtilization of solar energy for electric power production provides a practical approach for partially solving the energy crisis and at the same time reducing environmental pollution. Here, we demonstrate a photoelectrochemical cell based on a g-C3N4 photocatalyst using O2/H2O redox couples, fabricated with iron(III) phthalocyaninate [FeIII(Pc)Cl] mixed with g-C3N4 sprayed on carbon paper as the cathode and a nickel mesh (Ni mesh) coated with g-C3N4 as the anode. Under irradiation, g-C3N4 in the anode harvests photons and produces excited electrons and holes. The produced electrons transfer to the cathode by an external circuit and reduce O2 near the cathode to H2O2, electrochemically catalyzed by g-C3N4 through two-electron, two-proton processes, while the produced H2O2 is further reduced by [FeIII(Pc)Cl] to H2O. The generated holes in the anode oxidize H2O to H2O2 by two-electron, two-proton processes. The formed H2O2 can further be oxidized by the Ni mesh with O2 generation. This photoelectrochemical cell achieves an open-circuit voltage of 0.91 V under AM 1.5G solar light (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2) in 0.1 M HCl under air atmosphere. The total solar to electric power efficiency of this cell is 0.146%. Additionally this cell can generate and store H2O2 (chemical energy) with the electrodes disconnected under light, where water oxidation photocatalyzed by g-C3N4 will occur on both the electrodes. By connecting the electrodes, the cell can be operated as a fuel cell using H2O2 as the fuel in the absence of sunlight with an area-specific capacity of 350 mC cm−2 and a mass-specific capacity of 237 C g−1.

Broader context
The conversion of solar energy into electrical power is crucial for partially solving the energy crisis and reducing environmental problems. Efficient solar cells provide a reasonable route for solar energy harvesting but they are limited by the intermittency of solar radiation. Fuel cells provide a way to store chemical energy (generated in different ways including solar to chemical energy conversion) as a fuel and transfer it to electric energy when needed. The conventional fuel cell strategy is however to generate and store the fuel in one compartment and apply it for electric power generation in another one. We apply a photoelectrochemical cell based on a g-C3N4 photocatalyst using O2/H2O redox couples with H2O2 as an intermediate and demonstrate that it is possible to convert solar energy to electric power directly. Additionally, we demonstrate that it is possible to overcome the intermittency of solar energy by producing H2O2 (chemical energy) when light is available and converting it to electrical energy in the dark.

Introduction
Solar energy is a clean, renewable, sustainable and abundant energy source which is why it is practically applied and extensively studied.1–7 Currently, converting solar energy into electricity is mainly accomplished by photovoltaic devices such as the Si solar cell.8–11 The highest efficiency of Si solar cells reported to now (by Yoshikawa et al.11) is 26.3%. The advantages of Si solar cells include abundant raw material supply, high efficiency, low cost and low toxicity. The intermittency of solar energy however presents critical challenges for the utilization of solar energy as a global primary energy source.
The use of solar energy to convert energy-poor molecules into energy-rich molecules such as H2 and H2O2 is an alternative environment-friendly technology for energy storage and supply. A fuel cell may be then applied to generate electrical energy utilizing the chemical energy of the solar fuel. H2O2 in water is an important solar fuel candidate material because of its easy storage as a liquid not requiring high pressure tanks, its high energy density and its green, non-polluting products. H2O2 can be produced by the two-electron, two-proton oxidation of water12,13 and reduction of O2.14 One compartment H2O2 fuel cells, in which H2O2 is used as both an oxidant and reductant have recently been developed.15–20 The reactions of the H2O2 fuel cell at the anode and the cathode are given by eqn (1) and (2), respectively. Anode: H2O2 → O2 + 2H+ + 2e− 0.68 V vs. RHE(1) Cathode: H2O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → 2H2O 1.77 V vs. RHE(2) Total: 2H2O2 → O2 + 2H2O 1.09 V(3)H2O2 fuel cells are environmentally friendly, emitting only oxygen and water upon generation of electricity. The theoretically achievable output potential is 1.09 V.15,16
In a recent work, Fukuzumi et al.5 achieved an efficient photocatalytic production of H2O2 from water and O2 with bismuth vanadate and a cobalt(II) chlorin complex in a two compartment cell. The conversion of the chemical energy of the produced H2O2 was then performed by a H2O2 fuel cell (48 mM H2O2, pH 1.3), employing a FeII3[CoIII(CN)6]2 modified carbon cloth as a cathode and a nickel mesh as an anode, respectively.18 The cell achieved an open-circuit potential (OCP) and a maximum power density of 0.79 V and 2.0 mW cm−2, respectively. These two processes are separate, including: (i) the photocatalytic production of H2O2 from water and O2 and (ii) electric power generation applying the H2O2 fuel cell with water and O2 generation. It is worth noting that by combining these two reactions, H2O2 generation and consumption, a new regenerative solar-light-driven cell based on photocatalysts using O2/H2O redox couples can be achieved. O2/H2O couples have good diffusion properties and photochemical stability. However, solar-light-driven cells using these O2/H2O redox couples have never been reported due to the enormous overpotentials for both reactions (i.e., O2 evolution through water oxidation and the consumption of oxygen by cathodic reduction).21 Since the redox potential of O2/H2O couples (1.23 V vs. RHE) is much more positive than that of other common couples, using O2/H2O couples could potentially increase the cell theoretical open circuit potential (between the Fermi level of the photocatalysts and the redox potential of the redox couple).
We report herein a photoelectrochemical cell based on a g-C3N4 photocatalyst, in which, O2/H2O redox couples (with H2O2 as an intermediate) go through multiple-electron-transfer redox chemistry to shuttle charges between the anode and cathode. Fig. 1 illustrates our conceptual design of the device and its working scheme. This solar cell is fabricated by iron(III) phthalocyaninate [FeIII(Pc)Cl] mixed with g-C3N4 sprayed on carbon paper as the cathode, while a nickel mesh (Ni mesh) coated with g-C3N4 serves as the anode. g-C3N4 is a metal-free photocatalyst with a graphitic stacking structure of melem sheets, and it can be easily prepared from urea, melamine or some other nitrogen-rich organic molecules.13,22 It was recently found to be capable of catalyzing the generation of H2O2 by a two-electron, two-proton reduction of O2 in the dark or the oxidation of H2O under light.6,9,12,23,24 The electrocatalysts for reducing and oxidizing H2O2 (emitting H2O and O2, respectively) produced on the surface of the two electrodes (by the catalytic action of g-C3N4) are [FeIII(Pc)Cl] and the Ni mesh, respectively, adopting the fuel cell design of Fukuzumi et al.15 Under irradiation, the photocatalyst, g-C3N4, in the anode harvests photons and produces excited electrons and holes. The produced electrons transfer to the cathode through an external circuit, and reduce O2 near the cathode to H2O2, electrochemically catalyzed by g-C3N4 through two-electron, two-proton processes. The produced H2O2 is further reduced by [FeIII(Pc)Cl] to H2O, while the FeIII is oxidized to FeIV and then reduced to its native form by electron transfer.25 The generated holes in the anode oxidize H2O to H2O2 by two-electron, two-proton processes. The formed H2O2 can further be oxidized by the Ni mesh with O2 generation. This photoelectrochemical cell achieves an open-circuit voltage of 0.91 V and a maximum power density of 0.156 mW cm−2 under AM 1.5G solar light (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2) in 0.1 M HCl under air atmosphere. Meanwhile, the cell can work in the most earth-abundant resource of seawater (adjusted to pH 1 using HCl), with a maximum power density of 0.125 mW cm−2. In addition, this cell can also store the chemical energy (H2O2) produced by the water oxidation reaction, photocatalyzed by g-C3N4, with both the electrodes disconnected under light. By connecting the electrodes, the cell can operate as a fuel cell and utilize the chemical energy as the fuel in the absence of sunlight (up to an area-specific capacity of 350 mC cm−2 and a mass-specific capacity of 237 C g−1).
 Fig. 1  Overall working scheme of the solar-light-driven cell based on g-C3N4. O2/H2O redox couples go through multiple-electron-transfer redox chemistry to shuttle charges between the anode and cathode with H2O2 as an intermediate. The anode is made of a Ni mesh modified with g-C3N4. g-C3N4 in the anode harvests photons and produces the excited electrons and holes. The generated holes oxidize H2O to H2O2 by two-electron, two-proton processes. Subsequently, the produced H2O2 is oxidized by the Ni mesh forming O2. [FeIII(Pc)Cl] mixed with g-C3N4 sprayed on carbon paper is used as the cathode. The produced electrons in the anode further transfer to the cathode by an external circuit and reduce O2 near the cathode to H2O2, electrochemically catalyzed by g-C3N4 through two-electron, two-proton processes. H2O is regenerated by the reduction of H2O2 at the cathode by the [FeIII(Pc)Cl] catalyst, while the FeIII is oxidized to FeIV and reduced by electron transfer. 
Experimental
Preparation of the g-C3N4 and [FeIII(Pc)Cl]/C3N4 catalysts
g-C3N4 was synthesized by the simple pyrolysis of urea under ambient pressure. In detail, 10 g of urea was put in a covered alumina crucible with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mL NH3·H2O, and heated in a muffle furnace at a rate of 0.5 °C min−1 to 550 °C for 3 hours.22 After natural cooling, a yellow coloured powder was obtained, and the corresponding samples were labelled as g-C3N4-0, g-C3N4-1, g-C3N4-2, g-C3N4-3, g-C3N4-4 and g-C3N4-5. The [FeIII(Pc)Cl]/C3N4 catalysts were prepared by adding 1.5 mg [FeIII(Pc)Cl] and 60 mg g-C3N4 to 0.5 wt% alpha-naphthol in alcohol (30 mL), and treating by ultrasonication for 30 minutes.
Characterization of the g-C3N4 catalysts
Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were recorded with an FEI-Tecnai F20 (200 kV). The TEM samples were prepared through dropping the catalyst solutions onto a copper grid covered with a polyvinyl supporting film and dried in air. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas and pore size distributions were calculated by plotting the adsorption isotherm of N2 at liquid N2 temperature (77 K). These measurements were made using a Micromeritics ASAP 2050 porosimeter. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the products were collected with an X-ray diffractometer (Empyrean, PNalycal) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded with a Bruker Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Hyperion) using a standard KBr pellet technique. Room temperature UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained with a Lambda 750 (Perkin-Elmer) spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results were obtained with a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using a monochromatic Mg Kα X-ray source (hν = 1283.3 eV). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, an Agilent Technologies 5975C Mass Selective Detector operating in the electron impact ionization mode) was used to detect the reaction products.
Preparation of the [FeIII(Pc)Cl]/C3N4/carbon paper electrodes and the g-C3N4/Ni mesh electrodes
[FeIII(Pc)Cl]/C3N4/carbon paper electrodes were prepared by spraying a [FeIII(Pc)Cl]/C3N4 suspension on TORAY-060 carbon paper, and g-C3N4/Ni mesh electrodes were obtained by spraying a g-C3N4 catalyst suspension (2 mg mL−1 in 0.5 wt% alpha-naphthol in alcohol) on Ni mesh. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the electrodes (Fig. S1, ESI†) were obtained via an FEI-Quanta 200 scanning electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV.
Electrochemical reduction of H2O2 with [FeIII(Pc)Cl] and oxidation of H2O2 with Ni mesh
The electrochemical behaviour of carbon paper (TORAY-060) modified with [FeIII(Pc)Cl] and Ni mesh (150 mesh) immersed in H2O2 was examined with a Model CHI 920C workstation (CH Instruments, Chenhua, Shanghai, China) at 25 °C. The tests were performed in 0.1 M HCl containing 300 mM H2O2. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a platinum electrode were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The potentials reported in the Results section are given versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation (ERHE = ESCE + 0.0592 × pH + 0.2412).
Performance tests of the photoelectrochemical cell
The photoelectrochemical cell is composed of a [FeIII(Pc)Cl]/C3N4/carbon paper electrode as the cathode, and a g-C3N4/Ni mesh electrode as the anode, respectively. The performance tests were conducted in a closed system in 0.1 M HCl under air atmosphere under AM 1.5G solar light (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2). The digital picture of the cell is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The current and power density values using a 1 cm−2 electrode were measured using a Model CHI 920C workstation (CH Instruments, Chenhua, Shanghai, China) at 25 °C. For all fabricated cells, the open-circuit potential (OCP) was monitored for 5 minutes before the I–V test (Fig. S3, ESI†).
Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization of the electrodes
The different g-C3N4 samples were prepared by pyrolysis of a mixture of ammonium hydroxide and urea power at 550 °C for 3 hours (see Experimental section). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of g-C3N4-3 (Fig. 2a) show that g-C3N4-3 has a highly porous morphology. In addition, compared with the other samples, the pores in the g-C3N4-3 surface are larger and more obvious (Fig. S4, ESI†). The porosity of the g-C3N4-3 sample was determined by nitrogen sorption isotherm measurements. A typical type-IV isotherm with a H3-type hysteresis loop is observed, supporting the TEM observation of the existence of mesopores. In addition, the BJH pore-size distribution curve (inset in Fig. S5, ESI†) reveals that the g-C3N4-3 sample exhibits a narrow peak centered at 3.6 nm. The g-C3N4-3 sample has the largest Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (114 m2 g−1) among all the samples checked (Table S1, ESI†). Additional characterizations of the g-C3N4 samples such as X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD, Fig. S6, ESI†), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Fig. S7, ESI†), UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. S8, ESI†) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. S9, ESI†) indicate that these catalysts have similar structural and photoabsorption properties to those of g-C3N4 reported previously.10
H2O2 generation by photo-oxidation of H2O and reduction of O2
In g-C3N4, a hole (h+) generated in the valence band is positive enough to oxidize water.12 We first show that light irradiation of g-C3N4 photo-catalyzes the oxidation of water to H2O2, following 12 h irradiation of aqueous dispersions of g-C3N4 under xenon light (70 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G solar light). The g-C3N4 catalyst powder was removed by centrifuging. A peroxide indicator (o-tolidine) was added to the reacted solution to monitor the H2O2 production via the 438 nm peak.9,13 Several g-C3N4 catalysts were tested, and g-C3N4-3 was found to be the most efficient for H2O2 generation (Fig. S10, ESI†). Note that here with H2O2 generation the products of water splitting should include small amounts of hydrogen.12
H2O2 was also reported14 to be generated by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of O2 electrochemically catalyzed by g-C3N4 (also in the dark). We therefore studied the electron transfer number of O2 reduction via a g-C3N4 electrode using the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) method (Fig. S11, ESI†). The calculated electron-transfer number is 2.43, indicating the formation of H2O2 from O2 on the disk electrode. No significant ORR enhancement under light irradiation of the g-C3N4 electrode was observed (Fig. S11, ESI†) and the electron transfer number of the illuminated electrode was the same as that of the electrode in the dark. This indicates that the ORR of O2 by g-C3N4 is electrochemically catalyzed and not photocatalyzed. The RRDE measurements of the different g-C3N4 electrodes were similar so g-C3N4-3 (found to have the highest H2O2 yield for the photocatalysis of H2O oxidation) was chosen as the catalyst for all further experiments and simply denoted as g-C3N4.
H2O2 oxidation and reduction
The catalysts used in the anode and cathode to oxide and reduce the H2O2 were Ni mesh and the iron(III) phthalocyanine complex [FeIII(Pc)Cl], following ref. 15. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Fig. S12a, ESI†) show that the onset potential for H2O2 reduction of the carbon paper electrode modified with [FeIII(Pc)Cl] in 0.1 M HCl containing 300 mM H2O2 is 0.96 V (vs. RHE). The onset potential for H2O2 oxidation (Fig. S12b, ESI†) of the Ni mesh is about 0.86 V (vs. RHE), which is lower than that for H2O2 reduction on the electrode with [FeIII(Pc)Cl]. This proves that the H2O2 fuel cell which oxidizes H2O2 with the Ni mesh electrode and reduces H2O2 with the [FeIII(Pc)Cl] electrode can produce electric power.
The performance of the cell (not optimized)
The solar-light-driven cell is fabricated with iron(III) phthalocyaninate [FeIII(Pc)Cl] mixed with g-C3N4 sprayed on carbon paper as the cathode, while a nickel mesh (Ni mesh) coated with g-C3N4 serves as the anode (Fig. 1). With light irradiation on the anode, the excited electrons produced by g-C3N4 will transport quickly to the Ni mesh and then transfer to the cathode through an external circuit (Fig. 1), which is why O2 is not reduced on the anode and no H2 molecules can be detected in the anode region, just O2. The holes generated oxidize H2O forming H2O2 by a two-electron, two-proton water oxidation. Subsequently, the produced H2O2 is oxidized by the Ni mesh forming O2. It is noteworthy that although Ni has a large number of electrons from g-C3N4, it is selective in that it can still oxidize H2O2 and does not reduce H2O2 even with electrons present.26 In contrast, in the cathode region, it is oxygen reduction (the cell operates under air) catalyzed by g-C3N4 which occurs on the cathode to form H2O2 by two-electron, two-proton processes. H2O2 is further reduced to H2O by the [FeIII(Pc)Cl] catalyst, where FeIII is oxidized to FeIV and reduced by electron transfer.25 The performance of the cell composed of a [FeIII(Pc)Cl]/C3N4 modified carbon paper cathode (catalyst load 0.5 mg cm−2, [FeIII(Pc)Cl] concentration of 0.025 g[FeIII(Pc)Cl]/gcatalyst) and a g-C3N4 modified Ni mesh anode (catalyst load 0.5 mg cm−2) was measured in 0.1 M HCl under air. As shown in the I–V (black) and I–P (blue) curves plotted on a logarithmic current scale in Fig. 2b, with the anode being irradiated under AM 1.5G solar light (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2), the open-circuit potential (OCP) and the maximum power density were 0.86 V and 0.127 mW cm−2 (circle), indicating that the cell made of the electrodes modified with g-C3N4 generates electricity. The curves plotted on a linear scale are shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). However, it is strange that the cell with the anode in the dark has an OCP of 0.58 V and a small power density of 0.01 mW cm−2 as well, which is inconsistent with the traditional performance of solar cells (the power is fully driven by solar energy). We believe that at this point the cell can generate electricity due to oxidation of the Ni mesh electrode and the oxygen reduction (the cell operates under air) catalyzed by g-C3N4. Since the cell has dark voltage and a small dark power density, this cell is defined as a photoelectrochemical cell instead of a solar cell. While with light irradiation Ni will have a large number of electrons from g-C3N4, this can hinder the oxidation of the Ni mesh or facilitate its self-healing. However, it is hard to assess how much power the oxidation of Ni will contribute to the light power of the photoelectrochemical cell. Here, to make the calculation more reasonable, the solar-to-electric energy conversion efficiency was calculated from the maximum power density obtained from the new I–P curves for the checked cell with the dark curve set as the zero of the current (see ESI†).
 Fig. 2  (a) TEM image of the g-C3N4-3 catalyst. (b) I–V (black) and I–P (blue) curves plotted on a logarithmic current scale of the solar-light-driven cell with the anode being irradiated with 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G solar light (circle) and in the dark (square) in 0.1 M HCl, and the fuel cell in the dark in 0.1 M HCl containing 300 mM H2O2 (triangle). The solar-light-driven cell is composed of a [FeIII(Pc)Cl]/C3N4 modified carbon paper cathode (catalyst load 0.5 mg cm−2, [FeIII(Pc)Cl] concentration of 0.025 g[FeIII(Pc)Cl]/gcatalyst) and g-C3N4 a modified Ni mesh anode (catalyst load 0.5 mg cm−2). The fuel cell is composed of [FeIII(Pc)Cl] modified carbon paper as the cathode and Ni mesh as the anode. The tests were performed under air atmosphere. 
The I–V (black) and I–P (blue) curves for the H2O2 fuel cell with the Ni mesh anode and the [FeIII(Pc)Cl]/carbon paper cathode in 0.1 M HCl solution containing 300 mM H2O2 are shown in Fig. 2b as well (triangle). The cell has an OCP of 0.62 V, which is larger than the difference between the onset potentials of the H2O2 oxidation and reduction reactions catalyzed by the Ni mesh and [FeIII(Pc)Cl], respectively. This is most likely due to the Ni redox chemistry that is occurred in the cell during electricity generation. In addition, compared with the maximum power density (0.01 mW cm−2) measured in previous work15 at pH 3, the value of the cell measured at pH 1 (0.026 mW cm−2) is slightly larger. The maximum power density of the photoelectrochemical cell is about 5 times that of the H2O2 fuel cell and 2 times that of the photoelectrochemical cell in 0.1 M HCl containing 300 mM H2O2 in the dark (Fig. S14, ESI†), demonstrating that the photoelectrochemical cell generates more power for storing chemicals than the fuel cell generates in using those chemical products.
Working mechanism of the photoelectrochemical cell
To further investigate the working mechanism of the photoelectrochemical cell, the anode and cathode were separated into two compartments using a proton-permeable Nafion membrane to prevent gas diffusion (Fig. S15, ESI†). The influence of the light intensities (under N2) and the gas environments (in the dark) of the anode (C3N4/Ni) or the cathode ([FeIII(Pc)Cl]/C3N4/CP), respectively, on the cell performance was studied (Fig. S16, ESI†), while another electrode in 0.1 M HCl was irradiated under AM 1.5G solar light (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2) under air. The electrode conditions are arranged as shown in Table S2 (ESI†). Note that the water oxidation reaction can be photocatalyzed by g-C3N4 under N2, and the ORR of O2 by g-C3N4 is electrochemically catalyzed and not photocatalyzed. The cell power density increases (Fig. S16a, ESI†) with the intensity of the light irradiating the anode. The power density did not change when the cathode was irradiated with different light intensities. We attribute the increase of the maximum power density of the cell with the irradiating light intensity of the anode to the enhancement of the photo-absorption of g-C3N4 and the water oxidation reaction photo-catalyzed by g-C3N4. This water oxidation occurs only at the anode. In the cathode region, in contrast, g-C3N4 catalyzed photo-oxidation of water is not occurring since electrons from the anode quickly occupy the photo-generated holes used to oxidize water on the surface of the g-C3N4 coated cathode. The anode response to irradiation by light with different wavelengths using a band-pass filter was studied as well (Fig. S17, ESI†). The maximum power density of the cell of 0.072 mW cm−2 at 435 ± 20 nm decreases with increasing wavelength following the light absorption curve of g-C3N4. The dependence of the cell maximum power density on the intensity and wavelength of the light irradiation of the anode thus indicates that the H2O2 generation in the anode region is from the photo-absorption of g-C3N4. The effect of the cell atmosphere on its performance in the anode and the cathode regions is presented in Fig. S16b (ESI†). The cell maximum power density does not depend on the atmosphere of the anode and increases with the introduction of oxygen to the cathode region. Based on the above analysis of our cell, the intermediate H2O2 is produced by photo-catalyzed water oxidation in the anode region and by the oxygen reduction reaction electrochemically catalyzed by g-C3N4 in the cathode region.
Stability, pH effect and the performance using seawater (optimized cell)
Optimization experiments were performed using a one compartment cell configuration with both electrodes immersed in 0.1 M HCl and irradiated by 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G solar light under air atmosphere (Fig. S2, ESI†). Note that the illumination of the cathode under air atmosphere does not affect the performance of the photoelectrochemical cell (Fig. S18, ESI†). Through adjusting the [FeIII(Pc)Cl] concentration (g[FeIII(Pc)Cl])/(g[FeIII(Pc)Cl] + g[g-C3N4]) and the total amount of catalyst (g[FeIII(Pc)Cl] + g[g-C3N4]) sprayed on the cathode and g[g-C3N4] sprayed on the anode, the largest maximum power density available for our cell was obtained (Fig. S19, ESI†). The optimized photoelectrochemical cell is composed of a [FeIII(Pc)Cl]/C3N4 modified carbon paper cathode (catalyst load 1 mg cm−2, [FeIII(Pc)Cl] concentration of 0.025 g[FeIII(Pc)Cl]/gcatalyst) and a g-C3N4 modified Ni mesh anode (catalyst load 0.5 mg cm−2). The optimized photoelectrochemical cell has a maximum power density of 0.156 mW cm−2. The corresponding solar-to-electric energy conversion efficiency is about 0.146% obtained by setting the dark curve as the zero of the current (Fig. S20, ESI†).
Next we studied the stability of the optimized photoelectrochemical cell. The following tests were performed in a one compartment configuration with both electrodes under AM 1.5G solar light (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2) under air atmosphere as well. Fig. 3a shows the effect of the pH value on the cell performance. The maximum power density obtained at pH 1 (0.156 mW cm−2) is approximately twice as large compared to that at pH 2 (0.0983 mW cm−2). The maximum power density at pH 2 is also much higher than that at pH 3 (0.0603 mW cm−2) and pH 4 (0.0340 mW cm−2). The OCP decreases with increasing pH from 0.91 V to 0.70 V. The optimal pH to obtain a high power density and OCP is pH 1. The effects of salt ions on the cell performance were also investigated using electrolytes with different concentrations of NaCl in a 0.1 M HCl solution. Fig. 3b presents the OCP and the maximum power density of the photoelectrochemical cell versus the NaCl concentration under AM 1.5G solar light (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2). Increasing the concentration of NaCl from 0 to 2 M gradually decreases the OCP and the maximum power density to around 0.81 V and 0.109 mW cm−2, respectively. The cell performance in seawater (0.5 mol L−1) adjusted to pH 1 by HCl in Fig. 3c was slightly worse (0.125 mW cm−2) than that in regular water (0.156 mW cm−2). The corresponding electric energy conversion efficiency is about 0.115% after setting the dark curve as the zero of the current (Fig. S21, ESI†), indicating the possible use of seawater instead of pure water in this cell. The durability of the optimized photoelectrochemical cell in water and seawater was measured as well (Fig. 3d). The temporal evolution of the maximum power density of the optimized photoelectrochemical cell was tested in three 10 hour runs for a total of 30 hours operation. In each 10 hour run the I–V curves were measured once an hour. After each run the electrodes were kept dry overnight in the dark until the next run. The power density of the cell kept dry overnight decreases slightly compared to the power at the end of the 10 h run. The maximum power density of the cell is slightly reduced after the 30 h run for both the water and the sea water containing cells, indicating that the photoelectrochemical cell has a good stability in both aqueous water and seawater (pH 1). It is also interesting to note (Fig. S22a–c, ESI†) that a regular Ni mesh electrode not covered by g-C3N4 breaks after 3 h of operation in a H2O2 fuel cell (300 mM H2O2 in the dark at 0 V), while it only begins to curl after 6.5 h under the same conditions when covered by g-C3N4. Furthermore, the g-C3N4 deposited Ni mesh in the photoelectrochemical cell remains intact after 30 h of operation under light. The mass loss rate (Fig. S22d, ESI†) of the Ni mesh covered by g-C3N4 in the H2O2 fuel cell (300 mM H2O2 under dark at 0 V) is a little smaller than that of the pure Ni mesh, while the Ni mesh covered by g-C3N4 in the photoelectrochemical cell shows almost no loss of mass under light. This indicates that the deposited g-C3N4 catalyst protects the Ni mesh from etching during cell operation.

Energy storage
Photovoltaic solar cells provide an efficient, reliable solution for the direct production of electric power from solar energy. The advantage of the fuel cell concept lies in the ability to convert solar energy to chemical energy (i.e. produce a fuel) when solar energy is available and store it for use when an alternative to solar energy is required. We thus checked the possibility of storing chemical energy (H2O2) in our photoelectrochemical cell under light and then using this energy to produce electric power in the dark. The storage of H2O2 was performed with the two electrodes disconnected while the cell was immersed in 0.1 M HCl and irradiated under AM 1.5G solar light (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2) under air atmosphere for different periods. With the electrodes disconnected (exposed under light), no electrons can transfer between the electrodes. The water oxidation reaction photocatalyzed by g-C3N4 will occur on both the electrodes, and H2O2 can be stored. In this case a small amount of hydrogen will be produced as well.12 Furthermore, through connecting the electrodes, the cell will work as a fuel cell using the stored chemical energy of H2O2. The obtained capacity using the stored H2O2 was measured by loading the cell, measuring the current versus time plots and integrating the discharge curve. Fig. 4a shows the different discharge curves obtained with different loads (0.05, 1 and 10 kΩ) immediately after H2O2 storage for 30 min. The identical capacity values obtained under different loads guarantee the validity of the H2O2 storage/utilization experiment. The capacity of the cell increases with the H2O2 storage time (under the same irradiation intensity) in a sublinear manner and saturates at an area-specific capacity of 350 mC cm−2 and a mass-specific capacity of 237 C g−1 after 3 h (Fig. 4b). This is consistent with the time course of H2O2 production on the surface of g-C3N4 (Fig. S23, ESI†). The H2O2 storage/utilization process was found to be repeatable in three successive 30 min light-storage experiments yielding area-specific capacities of 193, 185 and 190 mC cm−2 (Fig. 4c). The ability of the cell to store H2O2 with different holding times after H2O2 storage was checked as well (Fig. 4d). The capacity obtained utilizing the stored H2O2 (following a 30 min H2O2 storage process) decreases with holding time, and is 63% of the initial capacity after 1 hour and only 6% after 6 h. The capacity obtained is indeed low and the holding time is short, but the feasibility of the H2O2 storage/utilization concept is however demonstrated and requires future studies to increase both the capacity and the holding time to practical values.

The H2O2 storage process was performed with the two electrodes disconnected, immersed in 0.1 M HCl and irradiated under AM 1.5G solar light (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2) under air atmosphere for different periods. The capacity was measured from the discharge current–time course of the cell connected to three different loads under dark.

Conclusions
In summary, we have, for the first time, demonstrated a photoelectrochemical cell based on a g-C3N4 photocatalyst using O2/H2O redox couples, which is a huge challenge because of the enormous overpotentials for both the oxygen production and consumption reactions. This cell produces electricity with an open-circuit voltage of 0.91 V and a maximum power density of 0.156 mW cm−2 using a water solution of 0.1 M HCl under AM 1.5G solar light (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2) under air atmosphere. Due to oxidation of the Ni mesh electrode and the oxygen reduction reaction catalyzed by g-C3N4, the cell has a small dark power density (0.01 mW cm−2). The solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of the photoelectrochemical cell is calculated to be ca. 0.146% from the new maximum power density (0.146 mW cm−2) obtained with the dark curve set as the zero of the current. This photoelectrochemical cell can use seawater (pH 1), slightly reducing the solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency to ca. 0.115%. In addition, with disconnected electrodes this cell can also store H2O2 (chemical energy) generated by water oxidation on both the electrodes with electrodes disconnected, and utilize it up to an area-specific capacity of 350 mC cm−2 and a mass-specific capacity of 237 C g−1. In contrast to conventional fuel cells that require an external fuel supply, our device can convert solar energy to electricity directly. Besides, this device overcomes the intermittency of solar energy by storage of chemical energy and utilization in the absence of sunlight. We believe that our device will open new perspectives both for fundamental research and the construction of solar-light-driven devices.

Broader context
The conversion of solar energy into electrical power is crucial for partially solving the energy crisis and reducing environmental problems. Efficient solar cells provide a reasonable route for solar energy harvesting but they are limited by the intermittency of solar radiation. Fuel cells provide a way to store chemical energy (generated in different ways including solar to chemical energy conversion) as a fuel and transfer it to electric energy when needed. The conventional fuel cell strategy is however to generate and store the fuel in one compartment and apply it for electric power generation in another one. We apply a photoelectrochemical cell based on a g-C3N4 photocatalyst using O2/H2O redox couples with H2O2 as an intermediate and demonstrate that it is possible to convert solar energy to electric power directly. Additionally, we demonstrate that it is possible to overcome the intermittency of solar energy by producing H2O2 (chemical energy) when light is available and converting it to electrical energy in the dark.

 	Fig. 1  Overall working scheme of the solar-light-driven cell based on g-C3N4. O2/H2O redox couples go through multiple-electron-transfer redox chemistry to shuttle charges between the anode and cathode with H2O2 as an intermediate. The anode is made of a Ni mesh modified with g-C3N4. g-C3N4 in the anode harvests photons and produces the excited electrons and holes. The generated holes oxidize H2O to H2O2 by two-electron, two-proton processes. Subsequently, the produced H2O2 is oxidized by the Ni mesh forming O2. [FeIII(Pc)Cl] mixed with g-C3N4 sprayed on carbon paper is used as the cathode. The produced electrons in the anode further transfer to the cathode by an external circuit and reduce O2 near the cathode to H2O2, electrochemically catalyzed by g-C3N4 through two-electron, two-proton processes. H2O is regenerated by the reduction of H2O2 at the cathode by the [FeIII(Pc)Cl] catalyst, while the FeIII is oxidized to FeIV and reduced by electron transfer.
