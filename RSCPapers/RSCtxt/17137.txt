10th anniversary
Happy 10th anniversary to J. Mater. Chem. C! 2022 has been very special for me, given that I was appointed an Associate Editor of J. Mater. Chem. C and Mater. Adv. in June 2022. Switching my role as an author to an editor has opened my eyes and allowed me to rethink what we expect for a high-quality manuscript. As an editor, I am constantly looking for novelty and impact in each submitted manuscript. I feel excited when reading a manuscript with a sparking new concept. This review article is directly related to my research on singlet fission materials, organic photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Importantly, this review is also an attempt to provide our new insights regarding the design of optoelectronic materials. From a unique perspective, we demonstrate to readers that three distinct applications (photovoltaics, OLEDs, and photocatalysis) may benefit from the same fundamental mechanism, i.e., taking advantage of high-energy excited state. I hope that readers will appreciate this review.

1. Introduction
Photophysics and photochemistry play fundamental roles in many natural phenomena on Earth,1 such as light adsorption/emission, eyesight of animals and photosynthesis in plants. Meanwhile, the fundamental understanding of photophysics and photochemistry has enabled the development of vast amounts of optoelectronic materials that facilitate various modern technologies, such as photovoltaics,2 light-emitting devices, and the chemical industry based on photocatalysis,3 which have become indispensable in daily life. Although different optoelectronic materials involve different elementary photophysical processes, they share one general requirement, that is, they have to be excited to a high energy active state via certain quantum mechanical effects.

Fig. 1a shows the Jablonski diagram4 of the excited states of a molecule upon photoexcitation together with the transitions that can occur.5 A closer look of the photoexcitation of the active materials via the absorption of a photon with an above-band gap energy is shown in Fig. 1b.6 Due to the quantum mechanical nature of this process, if the energy of the absorbed photon is significantly higher than the bandgap of the active materials, the photoexcited electrons and holes will both have excessive energy. This process is referred to as the thermalization of the active materials, and the high-energy excited electrons/holes are referred to as hot electrons/holes, hot excitons or carriers depending on the system. Besides photoexcitation, similar hot carriers can also be generated by attaining very high kinetic energy from being accelerated by a high electric field.

Traditionally, high-energy thermalization of the active materials has been considered to be unfavorable for many applications. Firstly, in most systems, the hot excitons or carriers will quickly relax to lower energy states via various cooling processes, which is a major pathway for energy loss and system heating. Meanwhile, the hot holes/electrons are highly active, which may cause instability or degradation of the active materials, induce side reactions, etc. Furthermore, in devices, these energetic carriers can be injected into normally forbidden regions, typically the dielectric layer, which may cause interface states that degrade the device performance.
In the past two decades, the perspectives towards hot excitons or hot carriers have gradually changed, given that many methods have emerged to take advantage of these energetic species to enhance the performance of optoelectronic devices or photochemical reactivity.7–9 Hot excitons and carriers have shown promising potential in many applications, particularly in the fields of photovoltaics, light emission and photocatalysis.
The theoretical efficiency of single p–n junction photovoltaic solar devices is about 33%, which is known as the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit.10 In 1982, Ross and Nozik proposed the application of hot carriers in photovoltaic devices to reduce the loss of carriers and increase the solar energy utilization.11 More recent investigations indicate that photophysical processes such as multiexciton generation (MEG) and singlet exciton fission (SF) are promising to improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices by converting one high energy exciton into multiple lower energy excitons.
The concept of hot exciton has also been applied in the field of electroluminescence. In the case of organic materials, spin electron injection will generate 25% singlet state and 75% triplet state according to statistics. In 2012, Ma et al.12 proposed a hot exciton material that realized the effective utilization of triplet excitons. Since then, many hot exciton luminescence materials have been reported and applied in electroluminescence devices.
In the field of photocatalysis, hot carriers, especially hot electrons, have a higher probability to cross the Schottky barrier and transfer from the metal to the conduction band of semiconductor, and thus have a greater chance to take part in photochemical reactions. Photocatalytic systems utilizing hot carriers can have an extended working spectrum and higher catalytic activity.
As discussed above, utilizing hot excitons or hot carriers is an unconventional but promising strategy for the design of new functional materials. Initially, in this review, we introduce the basic concepts of hot excitons and hot carriers, including the photophysical processes to generate these species and the methods for their characterization. Subsequently, we review the latest research progress in the development of optoelectronic materials that can utilize either hot excitons or hot carriers. The applications of these materials in three major fields are discussed, including photovoltaics, electroluminescence and photocatalysis. Finally, perspectives are given on the promising role of hot excitons and hot carriers in the design of high-performance optoelectronic materials, and the challenges faced by researchers in these fields.
2. Photophysical processes involving hot excitons or hot carriers
In semiconductors, excitons refer to the electron–hole pairs generated after the semiconductor absorbs photons, which are quasi-particles. Excitons can be classified as Wannier excitons13 and Frenkel excitons14 according to their electron and hole interaction ranges. In general, inorganic semiconductors produce Wannier excitons, whereas organic semiconductors produce Frenkel excitons. In inorganic semiconductors, hot excitons15 are produced by the phenomenon in which the materials absorb photon energy E beyond the bandgap threshold Eg. Hot means that the equivalent temperature Tx of the excitons is higher than the lattice temperature. The cooling process of hot excitons is shown in Fig. 1b.
In the case of organic semiconductors, because Frenkel excitons usually appear in single molecules, the discussion of excitons is related to the electronic configuration of molecules. The higher energy of excitons than the thermal equilibrium state often reflects the changes in electronic states and conformation, which follows Kasha's rule.16 After a molecule absorbs a photon, electrons transition from the ground state to the excited state. For a luminescent molecule, as shown in Fig. 1a, electrons in the first excited state may decay back to the ground state via luminescence. Meanwhile, electrons with energy above the first excited state will decay back to the first excited state by non-radiative pathways before returning to the ground state.
Microscopically, the three major fields discussed in this section shares the same basic mechanism. Firstly, hot excitons or hot carriers are excited by light or electricity in a short time. Secondly, the excess energy helps the excitons overcome energy barriers to realize some photophysical and photochemistry processes, such as multiple exciton generation (MEG), singlet exciton fission (SF), reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and photocatalysis (PC).
Herein, we summarize the representative photophysical and photochemistry processes related to hot excitons and hot carriers and explain their mechanisms and application prospects.
2.1 Multiple exciton generation
In the 1950s, the carrier multiplication effect of generating multiple electron–hole pairs due to the absorption of a single incident photon was discovered in semiconductor materials.2 Hot carriers excite new electron–hole pairs, and then they relax to the edge of the bond energy, which plays an important role in improving the efficiency of solar cells and the performance of optoelectronic devices.7 With the further study of nanomaterials (quantum dots and quantum wells), Nozik predicted the existence of high-efficiency carrier multiplication effect in nano-semiconductors in 2001–2002.17,18
In 2004, Schaller and Klimov19 observed high-efficiency MEG in nano-PbSe by means of transient absorption spectroscopy, proving Nozik's prediction. The absorption signal of PbSe QDs with different band gaps, Eg, decreases slowly with time at the pump photon energy, which is 1.55 eV, while the absorption signal decreases sharply with time when the energy is 3.10 eV. According to the principle of transient absorption spectroscopy, the spectral intensity is related to the number of hole–electron pairs in the quantum dot, and thus the absorption signal at 3.10 eV indicates that multiple electron–hole pairs are generated in the quantum dot, that is, multiple exciton effects. When the incident photon energy E > 3Eg, the impact ionization(II) efficiency (ηii%) increases significantly from zero with an increase in E, and even exceeds 100% when E > 3.6Eg. Therefore, the exciton efficiency is related to the energy of the incident photon.
The MEG threshold can be estimated using formula (1).20 (1)
The mechanism of MEG is currently based on the theory proposed by Nozik et al.7,11,17–19 According to this theory, the occurrence of MEG is affected by the cooling rate of hot excitons and the auger rate of excitons, which follow the following relationship:19 (2)
MEG is related to the energy-dependent quantum yield,6 QY(E). The functional form for QY(E) to model the quantum yield for ideal MEG QD absorbers is given by a sum of step functions, as follows: (3)where θ(E,mEg) is the Heaviside unit step function. kMEG is the rate constant of producing (i + 1) excitons from i hot excitons, and kcool is the cooling rate constant. When M = 1, the usual assumption is that one e−–h+ pair is generated per absorbed photon (SQ model). Setting M = Mmax = Emax/Eg gives the maximum possible multiplication allowed by energetic constraints and the highest possible efficiency for an MEG device. The results for MEG absorbers with M = 1, M = 2, and M = Mmax are shown in Fig. 2d.

2.2 Singlet exciton fission
Singlet exciton fission (SF) can be considered a special form of MEG in organic semiconductors.21 SF is a photophysical process, where a singlet state turns into two triplet states, as shown in formula (4).8,22 As the two-triplet states are coupled as an overall singlet state, SF is a spin-allowed transition process. Fluorescence (FL), intersystem crossing (ISC), and triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) processes are all competing processes of SF. It can be noted that the SF process emphasizes spin changes, and this significant difference from MEG is related to the structure of organic molecules, as shown in Fig. 3.23 In addition, most research on SF is based on organic molecules but not inorganic structures because heavy atoms have spin complexity and tend to cause ISC.24 S1 + S0 → 1TT → T1 + T1(4)

Commonly, for high-efficiency SF, the energy of the singlet state (S1) is equal to or higher than twice the energy of the lowest triplet state (T1):25 E(S1) ≥ 2E(T1)(5)
However, it has been reported that a too exoergic process may thermally enhance the competing processes,26 and thus the most ideal condition is that the singlet state energy is slightly above twice the T1 energy. To avoid the competition from TTA, twice the energy of the lowest triplet must be lower than the second triplet state, as follows: E(T2) > 2E(T1)(6)
For π systems with closed shells, it has been found that most of them satisfy formula (7), as follows:27 E(S1) − E(T1) = 2Kh,l(7)where Kh,l represents the exchange integral of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals, which can be understood as the magnitude of the repulsion degree of the two orbitals. In the SF process, 2E(T1) is less than or equal to E(S1) or slightly more than E(T1) must be met, and thus a large Kh,l should be guaranteed. Specifically, the overlap of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals must be large. According to the pairing theorem,28,29 the HOMO and LUMO of alternating hydrocarbons have the opposite energy with the related Hückel energy zero for even carbon π-conjugate systems, and the HOMO and LUMO orbitals on each atom have the same amplitude except possibly their sign. In addition, for the closed shell case, the HOMO and the LUMO are inevitably paired in an electroneutral alternating system. Thus, it can be concluded that Kh,l is the largest for alternating hydrocarbons with even carbons.
For an open-shell (two-radical) π system, only two electrons occupy exactly or at least approximately a pair of degenerate orbitals in the ground state. Four low-energy states, i.e., S0, S1, S2, and T1, will be generated due to the shell electron contribution.30 We choose A and B as the most localized representation of the two degenerate orbitals. The S0 and T1 states of the open-shell (two-radical) π system can usually be approximated, where A and B each carry a single electron. Alternatively, the energy difference between E(S0) and E(T1) is about 2KA,B, which means twice the exchange integral of two localized orbitals. For completely separated diradicals, the two localized orbitals can be largely staggered, causing E(S0) and E(T1) to be almost identical. However, for axial diradicals or π-conjugated diradicals, the orbitals cannot be completely staggered, and E(S0) is significantly larger than E(T1). To split the degenerate nonbonding molecular orbitals of the diradical, a perturbation is applied to them. This perturbation converts a diradical into an ordinary closed-shell ground-state molecule. Specifically, diradicals become diradicaloids, which are more stable than diradicals. Therefore, it can be concluded that a perturbation possibility exists such that the condition that 2E(T1) is less than, equal to or slightly greater than E(S1) is satisfied. Given that the T2 state originates from intershell excitations, it is likely that its energy will be above that of S1.25 This means as long as formula (4) is satisfied, formula (5) must be satisfied. Therefore, for diradical and diradicaloid molecules, as long as SF occurs, the probability of TTA will be greatly reduced.
The SF electronic mechanisms in the formation of 1TT are, follows:31 (i) direct internal conversion from S1 to 1TT (without the involvement of CT states), (ii) SF mediated by CT states (CT as virtual states assisting the formation of 1TT through a superexchange mechanism), or (iii) sequential two one-electron transfer steps with CT state as a real intermediate effective population prior to the generation of the triplet-pair. (8)
The rate constant can be expressed as formula (8) and (9), where kFRG and k are the rate constants, V and Vif are the coupling between initial and final states, Vmi is the coupling between the initial and intermediate state, Vfm is the coupling between the intermediate and final state, Em is the energy of the intermediate state, Ei is the energy of the initial state, and δ(Ei − Ej) is typically formulated as the Franck–Condon-weighted density of states, respectively.26 (9)
The SF rate is always slow by direct internal conversion because Vif is commonly small in organic molecules.32 The SF through the CT state is usually considered more efficient than that through the direct process. However, too strong coupling between the initial state and CT state may cause more deactivation channels, such as charge separation or excimer formation.33 In recent research, D–A polymers (macromolecules consisting of donor and acceptor alternating units) have potential as a new type of material with a high SF rate.34 Given that D–A polymers have a strong CT character, 1TT can be formed quickly. In addition, the formed 1TT states are located on the acceptor units separated by donor units, which decreases the possibility of TTA and excimer formation, promoting the separation of the 1TT state to free triplet state.35
2.3 Light emission from hot excitons
OLEDs are devices that emit light by injecting electrons and holes through the cathode and anode, respectively. Then, the electrons and holes are transferred to the emission layer (EML) through the transport layer of holes and electrons (HTLs and ETLs) and recombined to form excitons. In traditional OLED materials, only singlet excitons can be used. The recombination process of electrons and holes can be regarded as a two-electron system.36
For a two-electrons system, the eigenstates of the spin angular momentum operator Sz are as follows: (10)Therefore, there are four possible spin states: α(1)α(2) β(1)β(2) α(1)β(2) β(1)α(2)(11)with the eigenvalues are ħ −ħ 0 0. Because of the commutation relationship of spin angular momentum operator: [S2, Sz] = 0(12)
We need to verify whether the spin states are eigenfunctions of S2. (13)
It is easy to find that only the first two states are eigenfunctions of S2. (14)
According to the normalization relationship, two new states (symmetric and antisymmetric) can be made with a linear combination, which are eigenfunctions of S2: (15)
Also, their eigenvalues are: (16)
For S2 = s(s + 1)ħ2 and M = 2s + 1, there are three symmetric states M = 3 and one antisymmetric state M = 1. Therefore, it can be concluded that the exciton utilization is only 25% in traditional OLED materials. Therefore, improving the conversion efficiency of singlet excitons has become an important research direction in the field of OLEDs, such as TTA,37 TADF,38 and hot excitons (HE).39
Triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA), also known as p-type delayed fluorescence, was first discovered in phenanthrene and pyrene solutions. In the TTA process, the fusion of two excited triplet excitons can generate one singlet exciton in the excited state and one exciton in the ground state. TTA is the inverse process of SF (Fig. 4a).40 The singlet conversion efficiency of TTA is 62.5% (25% + 75%/2).

To achieve 100% utilization of excitons, the design idea of the thermal process was introduced at the OLED level. When excitons undergo reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) transport from the Tn(n ≥ 2) energy level to the Sm(m ≥ 1) level, this is a hot exciton process, as shown in Fig. 4c. When n = 1, the process is called TADF, which is considered a cold process, as shown in Fig. 4b.
In the case of the hot exciton process, its efficiency is determined by the internal conversion rate (kIC) of the triplet state and the reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC), which is furtherly determined by spin–orbital coupling (SOC).41 (17)where the ρFC term is evaluated in the framework of the Marcus–Levich–Jortner theory, as follows:42 (18)
According to formula (17), a large HSO and small ΔEST will lead to a large kRISC in the hot exciton process. Indeed, the HSO is usually small in organic molecules because of the weak j–j coupling in short period elements. The small ΔEST is the main parameter.
The kIC of the triplet state is determined by the non-adiabatic coupling of the Tn state and T1 state, which is highly correlated with the reorganization energy.43 The formula can be simply summarized according to Lin's work.44 (19)where  is related to the reorganization energy and is negatively related to |ΔETn−T1|.
Therefore, a large |ΔETn−T1| will lead to a small kIC, which is favoured in the hot exciton process.
2.4 Hot carriers in photocatalysis
In 1972, Fujishima and Honda reported electrochemical H2O splitting facilitated by photoexcited charge carriers in a TiO2 electrode using UV-light irradiation.3 Since then, photocatalytic semiconductor materials have been extensively applied in the photochemistry field including H2O splitting and organic transformation.
The basic process of photocatalysis can be divided into two steps, as follows: (1) the photocatalytic semiconductor absorbs photons and generates electron–hole pairs (excitons) and (2) some of the carriers are transferred to the surface for redox reaction and the others back to the ground state. Therefore, two conclusions can be further deduced, as follows: (1) a wider band gap is required to reduce the recombination probability of electrons and holes and (2) in terms of the Nernst equation, the reduction reaction can only occur when the bottom of the conduction band is higher than the reduction potential (ERed) of the reaction, and when the top of the valence band is lower than the oxidation potential, the oxidation reaction (EOx) takes place. However, semiconductors complying with the above-mentioned conditions often only absorb ultraviolet (UV) light, which is a small part of the solar spectrum and the visible region (Vis, about 42% in solar radiation) cannot be used.45,46 To improve the energy utilization, many strategies have been introduced for the design of photocatalysis. Among them, obtaining hot carriers through semiconductors with the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect is one effective strategy.
Hot carriers refer to either holes or electrons that have significantly higher energy than charge carriers at thermal equilibrium. SPR is a unique optical property usually associated with metallic nanostructures including Au, Ag, and Cu.47–49 The localized SPR excitation of a metal nanoparticle (NP) is often considered as an electromagnetic (EM) field coupled to the coherent oscillation of all conduction electrons in a conducting medium.9 It should be noted that metal NPs absorb visible light in this process and the absorption cross section can be up to 5 orders larger than that of dye-sensitizer molecules.50
The physical process of SPR-driven photocatalysis includes hot carrier (in most conditions hot electron) generation51 and injection process,52 as shown in Fig. 5.53 Electrons are excited from thermal equilibrium to a high-energy state after absorbing photons and injected into the CB of the semiconductor. The higher energy of hot electrons helps them cross the Schottky barrier,54 which is determined by the work function of the plasmonic metal, φM, and electron affinity, χs, of semiconductor photocatalysts. ϕSB = φM − χs(20)

The hot carrier injection mechanism can be divided into direct and indirect electron transfer. In metal NPs, direct transfer originates from chemical interface damping (CID), which requires the formation of hybridized surface states between metal NPs and adsorbates. The occurrence of CID directly leads to electron transitions in the hybridized states.55 In the case of indirect-electron transfer, two steps exist, i.e., hot electrons are generated in the metal NPs first, and then they transfer to the LUMOs of the adsorbates.
2.5 Characterization of hot excitons
To measure how hot excitons deviate from the thermal equilibrium state, an intuitive method is to measure the equivalent temperature (Tx) of the excitons,56 which can be obtained using formula (20).15I(E) is the emission intensity. (21)
However, in the physical processes we mentioned in the previous section, this direct measurement method is not commonly used. It is much more common to study the mechanism through transient spectroscopy. Time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy is often used to detect the change in the absorption of the excited state of the sample.57 The sample is excited by a pump light and the absorption of the sample before and after pumping is detected by two beams of probe light, which are before and after the pump light. The change in absorption due to the pump light can reflect the excited state relaxation process and is recorded as ΔA(λ,t), where λ is the wavelength of absorption and t is the delay time between the second probe light and pump light. The concentration of different states changes after the pump light is excited. According to the Lambert–Beer law, the absorption after delay time, t, reflects the concentration of different stated at t.

2.5.1 Time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. 
Transient absorption spectroscopy provides useful information on three main physical processes including ground-state bleaching, stimulated radiation emission and excited-state absorption.
(1) Ground-state bleaching (GSB) signal. After the sample is excited by the pump light, the concentration of the ground state of the sample becomes low. Consequently, ΔA is less than zero at the wavelength of the absorption of the sample.
(2) Stimulated radiation emission signal. After the sample is excited by the pump light, some particles at the ground state transfer to the excited states of different energy levels. When the probe light is incident on the sample, some particles in the excited state of high energy level may return to the excited state of low energy level and emit light, the energy of which is the same as the energy gap between two excited states. Consequently, the light intensity received by the light detector becomes greater than that before the pump at the wavelength of the emission light, and the absorption becomes small. Consequently, ΔA is less than zero. The different between the GSB signal and stimulated radiation emission signal is that the wavelength of ΔA of the latter does not match the wavelength of the absorption of the sample.
(3) Excited-state absorption (ESA) signal. After the sample is excited by the pump light, the concentration of excited states in the sample becomes high. Therefore, the ΔA is more than zero at the wavelength of the absorption of the excited state. When the excited state changes, the wavelength of the ESA will change. If the ESA of the different excited states of the sample is known, the physical process of the excited state can be confirmed, such as the MEG process,58 symmetry breaking charge transform (SB-CT) process,59 and SF.25


2.5.2 Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. 
The fluorescence lifetime reflects the average residence time of molecules in the excited state. The fluorescence lifetime is also known as the exciton lifetime. Nowadays, the fluorescence lifetime is mainly measured by the single photon counting method (TCSPC). Exciton separation is more likely to occur under the condition of long fluorescence lifetime. The exciton separation efficiency further influences the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE), which is the most important parameter in the field of photoelectricity.60 Alternatively, in the field of dynamics study, the difference among the electron–hole coupling state, electron state, and hole state cannot be simply distinguished from the transient absorption spectrum. With the help of time-resolved fluorescence spectra, the electron–hole coupling state could be determined from the transient absorption spectrum for the purpose of distinguishing excitons and charge-transfer states.61,62


2.5.3 Photocurrent spectroscopy. 
Photocurrent spectroscopy is an important characterization method in the fields of photovoltaics and photocatalysis. The semiconductor absorbs photons and generates electron–hole pairs. Under an applied bias voltage, the electrons move to the other electrode to generate a current. The photocurrent spectrum reflects the separation property of photogenerated electrons and holes. Generally, SPR and MEG will greatly increase the value of the photocurrent63,64 and organic semiconductors have a lower photocurrent than inorganic semiconductors because of the strong electron–hole coupling. The photocurrent spectrum can be further converted into an IPCE spectrum, which reflects the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the device.65 In formula (22), Jsc is the current density and P is the incident light power. (22)

3 Hot exciton materials for photovoltaics
Since the hot exciton phenomenon was first confirmed in CdS crystals in 1966,66 the research object of the hot exciton phenomenon has gradually covered inorganic materials, organic materials, quantum dots (QD), perovskites and many other materials.
As an important means to improve the energy conversion efficiency in the photovoltaic field, MEG and SF have also moved the target from the discovery and reporting of the original phenomenon to the application of devices, achieving certain progress.
3.1 Quantum dot MEG materials
Since the first confirmation of the MEG phenomenon in nano-PbSe by Schaller and Klimov in 2004, MEG has been found in other quantum dots (Table 1).
PbX compounds have a very small (0.5–1 eV)7,19,67 energy bond, Eg, and thus the threshold energy for MEG effects in PbX compounds is correspondingly low, which leads to the easy realization of multiple exciton effects in PbX compounds. The composition study of PbX compounds shows that their quantum efficiency has a certain relationship with the size of quantum dots. The MEG efficiency of the PbSexS1−x quantum dot system depends on the composition structure. The MEG efficiencies of PbS and PbSexS1−x increase as the size of their quantum dots decreases. However, the MEG efficiencies of PbSe quantum dots are basically maintained at 0.4.68 Due to the easy preparation of PbX compounds, some hot exciton solar cells based on the PbX effect have been reported,5,67,69 which realized a high external quantum yield of more than 100%. However, their PCE value is still at a relatively low level.
CdSe and CdTe have large bandwidths, Eg (1.74 and 1.475 eV at 300 K), and their preparation technology is mature to controllably prepare high-quality nanostructures. This is an advantage in exploring the physical mechanisms of MEGs70,71 (see Section 2.1).
In the case of the InX semiconductor, the effective mass of electrons (me) is much smaller than the effective mass of holes (mh).20 According to formula (1), the theoretical threshold can be calculated as 2Eg, which is close to the theoretical minimum value of the MEG. However, the experimentally measured QY of InX compounds is relatively low at about 120%.20,72
Silicon semiconductors are widely used in integrated circuit fabrication and are the mainstream of the present commercialized photovoltaic cells. Therefore, the MEG effect in nano-silicon has important potential applications and has received extensive attention. Beard first studied the MEG effect of nano-silicon and reported a QY of 260%.73 Meanwhile, the doped nano-silicon further reduced the threshold energy. The study of Ge quantum dots showed that their threshold is 2.8Eg and they have a quantum yield of 190%.74
Semi-metal materials have recently attracted attention due to their small bandwidths. Binks75 measured the MEG data of HgTe quantum dots, and the results were close to that of PbX. The presence of MEG was also confirmed in CdxHg1−xTe, Ag2S.76,77 Notably, an external quantum efficiency of 120% was achieved in CuInSe2 solar cells.78

3.2 Perovskites MEG materials
Due to their unique optoelectronic properties, perovskites have achieved an extremely high photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of about 25%,84 which is approaching the SQ limit. Therefore, in the field of solar cells, the MEG effect in perovskites is receiving widespread attention (Table 2). The MEG phenomenon has been observed in a series of perovskites, including FAPbI3,82 CsPbBr3,85 and CsPbI3.86 Compared with ordinary quantum dots, perovskites are more likely to generate trap states due to their relatively more complex energy level structure,87 which affects the cooling rate of hot excitons and further influences the application of MEG in perovskite photovoltaic devices. In 2022, Li's group reported the high performance of FAPb1−xSnxI3 NCs (x = 0 to ∼0.11) with a QY of 153% at 2.94 Eg and achieved over 100% IQE in solar cell devices.88

3.3 Singlet fission (SF) materials
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have received much attention due to their flexibility and tunability. In 2018, Chen's group optimized the device structure of OPV and achieved an increased PCE of 17.3%89 using SF as an important means to improve the EQE and PCE, which could break through the S–Q limit. Its molecule and device design are still meaningful but challenging. For most SF materials, they always act as the electron donor for the OPV device and the basic requirements for the design SF molecules were discussed in Section 2.2. In brief, the higher SF rate and triplet yield result a higher OPV efficiency without considering the loss of energy transfer. The molecules exhibiting the SF phenomenon can be found in our previous review in 2022.34 Herein, we focus on their performance in OPV devices.
SF materials with high efficiency can be roughly divided into three categories, i.e., polyacenes, biradicaloids and polymers. Their representative molecular structures are displayed in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Molecular structure of singlet fission materials. 
Polyacenes play an important role in the study of SF.33,90 Among them, tetracene and pentacene have a bright performance although the first study of SF began with the anthracene molecule in 1965. Schneider's group8 first observed the SF phenomenon in anthracene (1). Given that E(S1) is about 3.13 eV91 and 2E(T1) is about 3.66 eV,92 the singlet fission process of anthracene is endoergic, which leads to a low triplet yield generated by singlet fission. Therefore, SF studies on anthracene are scarce.
In 1968, Stacy's group93 reported the first observation of the SF phenomenon in tetracene (2) and got the fission rate of 4 × 1010–1012 s−1. In TIPS-tetracene, the E(S1) is about 2.3 eV and 2E(T1) is about 2.5 eV, and the singlet fission process is weakly endoergic,94 and thus it can occur at room temperature. In 2017, Campos's group95 achieved triplet harvesting from intramolecular SF in polytetracene. In 2019, Baldo's group96 achieved the sensitization of silicon by singlet exciton fission in tetracene. The triplet energy and SF rate of tetracene are relatively high, which indicates that tetracene has great application prospect.
The study of SF with pentacene started relatively late compared with the other two molecules. In 2007, Lochbrunner's group97 first observed the SF phenomenon in a pentacene (3) film. The E(S1) of pentacene is about 1.83 eV98 according to the absorption spectrum of the polycrystalline film and its 2E(T1) is about 1.62 eV.99 The exoergicity of singlet fission in solid pentacene is 0.1–0.2 eV, which leads to a very high SF rate at room temperature. In addition, because the pentacene dimer has a fast SF rate in solvent, pentacene has become an ideal model for studying the SF mechanism. However, the 1TT state is difficult to split into two triplet states in a dimer,100,101 and it is difficult to apply the triplet states generated by the SF of the pentacene dimer. Thus, to overcome this unfavourable factor, in 2013, Baldo's group102 achieved an EQE of above 100% in a singlet-exciton-fission-based organic photovoltaic cell using pentacene and C60.
Recently, lots of diradicaloid SF molecules have been found. In 2010, Michl's group103 found that the triplet yield of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (4) is almost 200% at 77 K, which could clearly be assigned to SF with τSF (the time the SF needs) of about 33 ps. In 2015, Goodson's group104 reported that quinoidal bithiophene (5) as a diradicaloid has high yield ultrafast intramolecular singlet exciton fission at room temperature and its triplet yield is 180% with τSF of about 1 ps. The authors found that after it is excited to the bright singlet state, the molecular system decays rapidly on the sub-picosecond timescale to the optically dark Ag, which represents a strongly bound 1TT state. In 2017, Fu's group105 found intramolecular SF in an antiaromatic polycyclic hydrocarbon (6). The authors claimed that the triplet yield of SF is about 142% in a thin film at room temperature and the τSF is 0.91 ps, which is an extremely short time. Antiaromatic 4 np dibenzopentalenes (DPs) have been demonstrated as a new class of single-chromophore-based intramolecular SF materials that exhibit an optically allowed S2 state with E(S2) > 2E(T1) and an optically forbidden S1 state.
Polymers are also important in the study of SF. For example, poly-tetracene and poly-pentacene. In this part, we mainly discuss normal conjugated polymers and D–A polymers, which do not contain a polyacene structure.
In normal conjugated polymers, the 1TT state occurs on the fs- to ps-time scale.106–108 However, their triplet yields are very low, which are about 0.1% to 20%.109,110 The conjugated polymers are linear, and the 1TT state formed by SF can only split by exciton diffusion on one dimension,106 and thus the hard diffusion may cause TTA. In addition, there is the possibility that 1TT dissociates into long-lived T1s, which may then end up in trap states, yielding lifetimes of several milliseconds.111 In 1989, Thompson's group112 found that poly-(4BCMU) (7) has SF property, although the triplet yield is only 0.1% in solvent. In 2000, Cuniberti's group109 found that PolyDCHD also has SF property. Because its E(S1) is about 2.15 eV and 2E(T1) is about 2.14 eV, this material is slightly exoergic in the SF process. However, despite this, the triplet yield is still low and is about 0.4% in blends.
In D–A polymers, the low yield of the triplet state has been greatly improved by the separation of the donor part and acceptor part, where SF occurs. In 2015, Sfeir's group113 developed PBTDO1′′A′′ (8) and PBTDO1′′B′′ (9), and then found that they both have a high SF rate in solution and thin films. In 2018, Sfeir's group114 further developed a new molecule, IIDDT-Me (10). The E(S1) state is 1.89 eV and the 2E(T1) state is 1.90 eV. The suitable energy level guarantees the rate of a short singlet splitting time of about 7.8 ps in solvent and the triplet yield is about 160–200%. These excellent conditions make it have great application prospect in device.
3.4 Hot exciton-based photovoltaic devices
Photovoltaic cells, also known as solar cells, are devices that convert solar energy into electricity. The photoconversion efficiency (PCE) is a quantity employed to evaluate the efficiency of photovoltaic cells. In an ideal single-junction PV device, the theoretical maximum PCE is calculated to be around 33%, which is known as the Shockley–Queisser limit.10 As the hot carriers relax to the edge of the bond energy, new electron–hole pairs may form, which is known as the multiple exciton generation (MEG) process. MEG materials can generate multiple excitons from each absorbed photon, and thus in principle can magnify the photogenerated current. In the previous three sections, we discussed three types of materials with MEG properties. In this section, we mainly introduce the photovoltaic devices fabricated using these three types of materials.

3.4.1 QD MEG material photovoltaic cell. 
In 2011, Nozik's group5 found that the peak external photocurrent quantum efficiency (EQE) exceeded 100% via MEG in a quantum dot solar cell. The device structure and test data are shown in Fig. 7.5 The peak EQE is 114 ± 1% in the best device measured and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) (corrected for reflection and absorption losses) was 130%. Long-chain organic ligands, such as oleic acid, are used in the synthesis of PbSe QDs to control the growth kinetics, allow stable colloidal dispersions, and passivate surface states through their metal–ligand chemistry. However, when present in QD films, they create a large barrier to electronic transport. The authors used 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT), which is shorter than oleic acid as the ligand, for the successful synthesis of PbSe QDs. However, the dithiol treatments resulted in the formation of QD films with much lower carrier mobilities of 0.0004 to 0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1115 compared with the hydrazine-treated PbSe QD film, which had carrier mobilities in the order of 1 cm2 V−1 s−1.116 The authors used both EDT and hydrazine in a sequential manner during the deposition of the QD film used in the solar cell, and the authors found that using hydrazine yielded a dramatic improvement in all the performance parameters. Through the EQE curves, the authors found that the best-performing device collected 1.14 pair of photocarriers per absorbed photon at the energy of almost 4 times the band gap energy. The MEG threshold for PbSe QDs is 2.61 times the band gap energy (Eg) with an efficiency of 0.62.

With more in-depth research in MEG, in 2018, Beard's group82 demonstrated that multiple exciton generation (MEG) in PbS|CdS Janus-like hetero-nanostructures is enhanced compared to that of single-component and core/shell nanocrystal architectures. The quantum yields (QYs) of photon-to-exciton conversion and possible mechanism of the devices are shown in Fig. 8.82 The band gap of CdS is very close to two times that of PbS. In addition, the introduction of CdS will “break” the symmetry between the conduction and valence band and slow down the cooling of localized “hot” holes.39 These two points are very conducive to the occurrence of the MEG process. Compared with core/shell nanocrystal architectures, Janus-like hetero-nanostructures will not form a barrier for hole extraction in photovoltaic cells.117 As the author claimed, for the 50:50 Pbs|Cds NCs, the threshold photon energy is very close to the energy-conservation-defined limit of 2Eg and the MEG efficiency is 0.98. However, despite the high MEG efficiency, the efficiency of the photovoltaic cell fabricated using PbS|CdS Janus-like hetero-nanostructures was as low as 3% and the EQE did not exceed 100%. These poor device performances are likely due to the imperfect carrier transport and collection at the electrodes.

3.4.2 Perovskite MEG material photovoltaic cell. 
Halide perovskite NCs have demonstrated remarkable performances in optoelectronics. Compared with other normal NCs (such as PbSe and PbS), halide perovskite NCs possess the property of phonon bottleneck with slow hot-carrier relaxation, which is favourable for MEG.118,119 In 2018, Sum's group observed low threshold and efficient multiple exciton generation in FAPbI3.120 In the same year, Gregorkiewicz's group86 observed efficient carrier multiplication in CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals. However, it is a great challenge to verify their inherent MEG in practical optical devices.
In 2022, Li's group88 observed MEG in tin-lead halide perovskite NCs and fabricated an NC-sensitized photoconductor. Among the three Sn-doping concentrations, the maximum QYMEG was 1.53 ± 0.06 at hν of 2.94Eg in FAPb0.93Sn0.07 NCs with the MEG efficiency of about 87%. In the NCs without Sn-doping, the QYMEG was 1.11 ± 0.04 at the hν of 2.88Eg and the MEG efficiency was about 40%. However, a slight decrease in optical property was observed at a higher Sn-doping concentration (x ≈ 0.11). To further study the application value of MEG in halide perovskite NCs, the authors fabricate an NC-sensitized photoconductor, in which the active layers were FAPb1−xSnxI3 NC-sensitized mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2). At the same incident power, the device sensitized with FAPb0.93Sn0.77I3 NCs exhibited a substantial enhancement in Iph and it was observed that the photocurrent internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was greater than 100%.


3.4.3 Singlet fission material photovoltaic cell. 
As introduced in the previous section, pentacene has received wide attention in SF research because of its high SF rate. In 2013, Baldo's group102 fabricated an organic photovoltaic cell using pentacene, exhibiting an external quantum efficiency of above 100% at the wavelength of 670 nm, which is consistent with the absorption of pentacene. Fig. 9 shows the device structure and the EQE of the absorption wavelength.102 The exciton confinement layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), which is between pentacene and PEDOT:PSS, is very important for improving the EQE by blocking the triplet diffusion to the anode and suppressing exciton recombination. C60 was used as the acceptor in PVs with the ability to extract charge from pentacene. The authors confirmed that the photocurrent was generated by triplet excitons, which are produced by pentacene SF by analysis of the photocurrent under a magnetic field. According to the current density–voltage characteristic of the pentacene solar cell, the power efficiency of the photovoltaic was 1.8 ± 0.1%.

Because of the high triplet energy level of tetracene, it has great application prospects in photovoltaics. Although the silicon PV cell has been widely used due to its excellent stability and high PCE (up to 26.6%), the highest efficiency of silicon PV cell is 33%, which is known as the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit. In 2019, Baldo's group96 sensitized silicon by singlet exciton fission in tetracene successfully. Fig. 10 shows the device structure and test data.96 The triplet excitons are transferred to silicon and the additional electron–hole pairs are formed. The additional electron–hole pairs increase the cell efficiency from the single-junction limit of 29% to as high as 35%. Triplet dissociation at silicon-tetracene heterojunctions121 and energy transfer from tetracene to PbS semiconductor nanocrystals122,123 have been reported. However, no evidence of triplet transfer from tetracene to silicon was found in hydrogen-passivated silicon with lithium fluoride interlayers.124,125 One reason for this is that the LiF interlayer blocks the transfer of carriers or excitons although it provides sufficient passivation to prevent the rapid recombination of charge carriers at the silicon surface.126,127 A hafnium oxynitride layer of 8 Å was used to passivate silicon and enable energy transfer from the triplet exciton generated in tetracene. With electric-field-effect passivation, an energy transfer yield of 133% was achieved.

4 Hot exciton OLEDs
Since Ma and Yang et al.12 reported hot exciton molecules, a series of hot exciton materials has been reported. As discussed in Section 2.3, large |ΔETn−T1| and small ΔEST are the basic design rule of hot exciton materials. According to the property of the excited state, the excited state of the CT feature has a small ΔEST, and its oscillator intensity is approximately equal to zero, which shows a poor luminous performance. Meanwhile, the excited state of the LE feature has a large oscillator intensity but its ΔEST is often not suitable for application in hot exciton materials. Therefore, Yang and coworkers128 proposed a hybrid local and charge transfer state (HLCT), which is a linear superposition of the CT state and the LE state. To realize this idea at the molecule level, they theoretically concluded that hot exciton materials should have the characteristics of intramolecular charge transfer state (ICT), which are usually twisting donor–acceptor molecules, as shown in Fig. 11a.128 In addition, the luminous efficiency of hot exciton OLED materials is often affected by their own nonradiative decay. Thus, to improve their luminous properties, organic dyes such as rubrene129 can be doped in hot exciton materials.

Nowadays, numerous donors and receptors have been used to construct hot exciton molecules (Fig. 11b and c).
4.1 Hot exciton materials with D–A structure
As shown in Fig. 12, the most common unit used in D–A hot exciton materials is PPI, which is a moderate acceptor with a relatively low triplet energy, which guarantees that PPI-based molecules have a large |ΔET2−T1| and small ΔES1T2. The imidazole ring in the PPI unit provides the ability to transport both electrons and holes, which further improve the roll-off efficiency.130 The typical PPI unit is often applied in blue light hot exciton OLEDs because of its energy level.
 Fig. 12  Some hot exciton materials with the D–A structure. 
In 2012, Ma et al.12 reported the first hot exciton material, TTA-PPI (1), which is a blue light hot exciton material with high fluorescence efficiency (about 90%) and its maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) achieved was 5.02%. Since then, many different attempts have been made to regulate the EQEmax and CIE coordinates. In 2017, Lee and Tong et al.131 reported three highly efficiency blue light hot exciton OLED materials, among them, the EQEmax of TPINCz (2) was 6.96% and its EQE remained at 6.56% when the brightness was 1000 cd m2. Molecules containing stronger CT state characteristics have also been studied. In 2013, Ma and Yang et al.132 developed a hot exciton material, TPMCN (3), which exhibited a PLQY of only 13% although the exciton utilization efficiency (EUE) achieved was 85%. In 2016, Lee and Tong et al.133 developed a sky-blue emission hot exciton material, Py-BPA-BPI (4), by introduce pyrene groups in the C6 and C9 positions. This material achieved an EQEmax of about 5.64% and extremely low turn-on voltage of 2.15 V. In 2019, Tang et al.134 reported the synthesis of three highly efficient blue-green hot exciton materials, introducing the AIE characteristic by combining a TPE unit with PPI. The combination of the HLCT excited state and AIE characteristics resulted in a high EQEmax of about 6.32% in pTPI (5) and 7.16% in ppCTPI (6), which has stronger CT state characteristics than (5).
Green D–A hot exciton materials have also been reported in recent years and the structures are not limited to PPI. In 2019, Yang et al.135 reported the preparation of four D–A-type hot exciton materials with a PZ unit, where the emission light of TPA-DPPZ (7) and TPA–PAPZ (8) was green and green yellow, respectively. The EQEmax of (7) is 3.42% and the EUE achieved was 43%, with the EQEmax of 2.56% (8). In 2020, Zysman-Colman et al.136 designed a new hot exciton material DPAAnCN by using cyanoanthracene as the acceptor and diphenylamine as the donor and achieved an EQEmax of 6.0% and EUE of 43%.
4.2 Hot exciton materials with D–π–A structure
Anthracene units have a large |ΔET2−T1| and small ΔES1T2 because of their energy level misalignment characteristics. Therefore, anthracene units can be inserted in the D–A structure to form the D–π–A structure, which is beneficial for the mixing of the LE and CT states and the formation of the HLCT excited state. Herein, we summarize some typical D–π–A hot exciton materials in Fig. 13.
 Fig. 13  Some hot exciton materials with a D–π–A structure. 
In 2014, Kido et al.128 reported the preparation of a highly efficient blue-emission material, BD1 (10). The EQEmax values of the non-doped and doped devices were 5.6% and 8.9%, respectively. They thought that the high EQEmax of BD1 stemmed from the TTA characteristics of the An group. In 2017, Pu et al.137 confirmed that the fluorescence of BD1 is from higher triplets (hot exciton mechanism).
In 2019, Pu et al.138 reported a highly efficient An-containing blue PPBA (11) with an EQEmax of 11%. In 2013, Liu and Wu et al.132 reported a deep-blue material, CzBACz (12). The PLQY of the non-doped film was only 0.24, but its EQEmax reached 3.9%, with a high EUE of 81%. Yi et al.139 designed a series of blue hot exciton materials by introducing different carbonyl groups with n–π* transition properties in 9,10-diphenylanthracene. SY3 (14) exhibited an EQEmax of 4.8% and EUE of 46%, which are the highest values among these molecules. In 2017, Ma and co-workers140 developed two D–π–A structure hot exciton materials, TPA-AN-BP (16) and CZP-An-BP. The non-doped device based on TPA-AN-BP had a sky-blue emission, with an EQEmax of 4.39% and EUE of 77%, which are much higher than that of CZP-An-BP. In 2019, Wu et al.135 reported a series of hot exciton materials containing triphenylphosphine oxide units as electron acceptors and An cores as electron donors and π bridge. Because of the n–π* properties of phosphine oxide unit, the AN9-MePO (17) molecule and its doped device achieved an EQEmax of 7.03% and EUE of 72%. However, the PLQY of this series of molecules was extremely low. In 2019, Ma and coworkers141 combined the classic PPI unit with an Au unit (20) and achieved an extremely high EQEmax of 10.48%. They further142 changed the connection of the PPI unit and realized a deep-blue material, mPAC (21), and the non-doped OLED device achieved an EQEmax of 6.76% and EUE of 89%.
Distyrylbenzene derivative (DSB) structures are often used in organic laser gain media,143,144 but thus far, electric pumped organic laser devices remained unfulfilled. In 2016, Ma et al.133 developed two green hot exciton materials based on a cyano-substituted DSB structure (DCS). The doped device based on β-CN-APV (24) showed an EQEmax of 5.3% and EUE of 49%. Unfortunately, they did not report the laser properties of the OLED.
4.3 Hot exciton materials with multiple D–A structure
The usual D–A and D–π–A structure hot exciton materials are limited by their energy levels and HLCT characteristics, and thus their CIE coordinates often concentrate in blue light and green light. To extend the CIE of hot excitons to red light, it is necessary to extend and modify the conjugated structure of hot exciton units. Therefore, many multiple D–A structures have been designed and a broad S1 realized from deep blue to NIR and HLCT characteristics, as shown in Fig. 14 and Table 3.

Lu et al.145 developed a group of deep-blue hot exciton OLEDs including D–A, D–π–A (24) and D–A–D (25) structures. The TPP-TXO2-based OLED achieved excellent deep-blue emission with a EQEmax of 10.5%, which is the best performance of a blue light OLED thus far. Wang et al.146 reported a D–A–D hot exciton material SDPS-4PhCz (26) for solution-processed OLEDs, which exhibited NUV emission at 417 nm and EQEmax of 4.92%. Thomas et al.147 reported the preparation of a deep-blue D–A–D hot exciton material with TPA donors and cyano acceptors, which achieved a high EQEmax of 6.5%.
Wang et al.148 reported the synthesis of two green hot exciton materials, BTH-DMF (28) and 2F-BTH-DMF (29), with a D–A–D structure, containing dimethylfluorene as a weak electron donor and benzothiadiazole (BZ) as an electron acceptor. The doped OLEDs based on BTH-DMF and 2F-BTH-DMF achieved an EQEmax of 9.13% and 8.52%, respectively, which are the highest performances of green hot exciton materials.
The naphthothiadiazole (NZ) core has a large |ΔET2−T1| and its energy gap is lower than that of the BZ and An unit. Thus, it is the most widely used building block for the synthesis of deep-red and NIR hot exciton materials. In 2017, Yang and coworkers149 reported the fabrication of high-efficiency NIR-OLEDs based on NZ2TPA (30), which had a D–A–D structure and achieved an EQEmax of 3.3%. They further149 replaced the donor TPA in NZ2TPA with dimethylacridine, and developed another hot exciton material NZ2AC (31), which achieved an EQEmax of 6.2% and EUE of 78% in the doped device. Tang et al.146 developed three nonsymmetrical D–A–D structure NIR emitters TNZPPI (32), TNZtPPI, and TNZ2tPPI (33), by introducing the PPI in TPA-modified NZ derivatives. Among them, TNZPPI showed the best performance, which achieved an EQEmax of 6.83% and EUE of 82%. All three molecules exhibited AIE properties.
5 Hot carrier photocatalysis
Since the first report of the Ag@TiO2 catalyst in 2008,150 many hot carrier photocatalysts have been reported. There are mainly three types according to the composition, i.e., metal nanoparticle photocatalyst, metal–semiconductor heterojunction and non-metal plasmonic nanomaterial photocatalyst, which have been summarized in some articles previously.151,152 The metals here are generally Pt, Au, Ag, Cu, and Al153–157 with plasmonic properties, as summarized in Table 4.

Hot carrier photocatalysts have been widely used due to their broad spectral response ranging from the ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) region. The emerging two-dimensional materials, i.e., MOFs and perovskites, also greatly expand the family of these catalysts. In this review, we pay more attention to their energy utilization performance in the solar spectrum (AM1.5), which is considered the working environment for large-scale industrial applications.
Photosynthesis is an efficient way to use solar energy in nature,176 which is composed of a light reaction (Photosystem II) and dark reaction (Photosystem I).177 The latter involves the reduction of CO2 to produce fuel (mainly converted into C3 and C4 compounds in plants).178 Nowadays, humans are also trying to convert inexhaustible clean solar energy into hydrogen fuel through photo-electrocatalytic reactions, as shown in Fig. 15. Currently, water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction are the mostly studied artificial photosynthesis. Hot carrier photocatalysis offers new avenues for material design with high incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), which has unique values in the field of artificial photosynthesis.

5.1 Solar water splitting
Water splitting is the earliest application of semiconductor photocatalysis.3 Previous studies focused on the splitting rate of water at a single wavelength. Generally there are two schemes for solar water splitting, where one is the conversion of solar energy into electric energy through photovoltaic devices (see Section 3) to drive water splitting, achieving a solar to hydrogen efficiency (STH) of 30% to date.179 The other is water splitting through photocatalysis, with the STH commonly less than 1%.180 In hot carrier photocatalytic water splitting, the photocatalyst is usually made into a photoelectric electrode to realize photo-electrocatalysis.181
In 2013, Moskovits and co-workers182 reported the fabrication of a photosynthetic device with long-term operational stability over 60 h. In this device, hot carriers were generated through the SPR effect of Au NPs and transferred to TiO2 and Co-OEC semiconductor photocatalysts to generate hydrogen and oxygen, respectively. As the excited surface plasmons in Au NPs decayed on the femtosecond timescale, the reported STH (∼0.1%) was low for practical use. In 2020, Chen et al.183 reported that solar-light-induced water splitting catalyzed by few-layer MoS2 on Au NPs realized highly efficient hydrogen production of about 285 mmol g−1 h−1. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of this work under the solar spectrum achieved 37.5%, demonstrating the great potential of hot carrier photocatalysis in artificial photosynthesis. Improving the stability of the catalyst is still a challenge for hot carrier photocatalysts. In 2019, Park et al.184 reported a photocatalyst with plasmon-induced hot carrier in the Au–Ni2P heterojunction, exhibiting long-term stability with continuous chronoamperometric performance of 50 h at an input potential of 1.5 V over 30 days, which provides guidance for designing long-life hot carrier photocatalysts. Table 5 lists representative examples with high STH.

5.2 Photocatalytic CO2 conversion
The reduction of carbon dioxide is a key step for hydrogen energy utilization and hydrogen fuel generation. For carbon dioxide reduction, the typically reported performance metrics used in this field is activity (AQE and formation rate) and selectivity.192 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction emerged in the 1970s.193 In recent years, with the gradual development of photocatalysis, especially the application of hot carrier photocatalysis, the feasibility of carbon dioxide reduction has been greatly expanded. The conversion products of CO2 reduction include many forms (CO, CH3OH, CH4, etc.) depending on the hydrogen consumed.

5.2.1 Conversion of CO2 to CO. 
Carbon monoxide is a common fuel and the main component of coal gas, which is widely used in industrial production. In 2020, Zhang et al.194 reported the highly selective photoreduction of CO2 by Au/CdSe–Cu2O nanostructures under visible light, exhibiting a high gas generation rate of about 254 μmol g−1 h−1 for CO over a 60 h period. In this work, they introduced a narrow bandgap semiconductor of Cu2O to avoid the interference of water splitting and achieved nearly 100% selectivity of carbon products. In 2020, Kuang et al.190 reported photocatalytic CO2 reduction using Au–CsPbBr3 NCs. The electron transfer from CsPbBr3 to Au achieved an injection efficiency of 78% at 30 ps under visible light (450 nm). Under illumination at a wavelength of 580 nm, the LSPR-induced hot electrons in Au NPs rapidly transferred to CsPbBr3 for CO2 reduction, reaching a high selectivity of CO about 85%.
In 2020, Lu et al.194 reported the preparation of a hierarchical Z-scheme g-C3N4/Au/ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst for highly selective CO conversion of about 94.1% and a high gas generation rate of about 242.3 μmol g−1 h−1. This photocatalyst also realized NO removal under visible light with an efficiency of 59.7%.
MOF materials have a good catalytic effect due to their large specific surface area.195 In 2019, Sun et al.196 reported the preparation of MIL-101(Cr)–Ag hybrids for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, which achieved remarkable production rates of 808.2 μmol g−1 h−1 for CO and 427.5 μmol g−1 h−1 for CH4.


5.2.2 Conversion of CO2 to CH4. 
Methane (CH4) is the simplest alkane and one of the main components of natural gas. At present, methane mainly comes from strata or deep-sea mining, a strategic resource. Alternatively, the photocatalytic (non-hot carrier) preparation of methane has made considerable progress for industrialization.197 Methane can be obtained via the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide:CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → CH4 + 2H2O
In 2019, Kon et al.198 reported the use of core–shell Ag@TiO2 NPs as a photocatalyst for CO2 conversion, where the CH4 evolution rate via the core–shell Ag@TiO2 was 10 times higher than that of the pristine TiO2 of 4.93 μmol g−1 h−1.
Two-dimensional materials are also used to construct hot carrier photocatalysts for the conversion of CH4. In 2018, Luo et al.199 reported the catalytic activities of an Au/P-doped g-C3N4 photocatalyst for high CH4 conversion of about 120 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light, which achieved a high AQE of about 2.83%. In 2019, Wang et al.198 reported that a noble metal (Pt, Au@Pd) NP assembly on MOF-74 as a photocatalyst could convert CO2 into CO and CH4. For Pt/Au@Pd@MOF-74, the CH4 yield was found to be 2.47 μmol g−1 h−1 with high selectivity of about 84%.
However, the overall hot carrier photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide to methane is still at a relatively low conversion rate,200 and its potential needs to be further explored in novel materials with good catalytic performance, such as MOFs and 2D materials.


5.2.3 Conversion of CO2 to methanol. 
Methanol is a liquid fuel with a simple structure and huge demand in industry. The easy transportation of methanol makes it a valuable hydrogen energy carrier, which is also considered as liquid sunlight.53 Nowadays, an industrial methanol production line using ZnO–ZrO2 solid solution catalyst has been realized in Lanzhou, China.201 The research of hot carrier photocatalysts in this field has also made some progress. The production of methanol is as follows:CO2 + 6H+ + 6e− → CH3OH + H2O
In 2019, Zhang et al.178 reported a theoretical prediction that the SPR effect of silver clusters can boost the conversion of CO2 to methanol. In 2020, Shen et al.202 reported that Au/Co nanostructured surfaces converted water and carbon dioxide into methanol under solar light irradiation with a low AQE of about 0.3%.
In 2020, Do et al.203 reported the preparation of a photocatalyst that incorporated Au NPs in the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) for the efficient sunlight-driven photoreduction of CO2. In this work, they achieved an extremely high MeOH yield of about 2500 μmol g−1 h−1, displaying the great prospect for the combination of hot carriers and MOF materials in this field.

6 Perspectives and outlooks
We reviewed the latest research progress in the development of optoelectronic materials based on the concept of utilizing either hot exciton or hot carriers. In these materials, hot exciton or hot carriers are commonly generated by above-bandgap high-energy photoexcitation or by electric injection. The applications of these new-concept materials are mainly concentrated in the fields of photovoltaics, electroluminescence and photocatalysis.
In the last decade, very fast progress has been made in the design of photoactive materials based on these new mechanisms. In the case of photovoltaic devices, inorganic materials and QDs based on the MEG mechanism attracted much attention in the earlier stage, while research on organic and polymeric materials based on the SF mechanism are very active at present. However, high-performance solar cells taking advantage of the hot exciton MEG and SF mechanism are still rare. The reported device structures are relatively simple and the photoelectric conversion efficiency is far from reaching the theoretical upper limit. Simultaneously, the emergence of new perovskite and 2D materials with high photovoltaic performances may provide new assistance and research platforms for the applications of MEG and SF materials.
In contrast, electroluminescence materials utilizing electrically generated hot excitons has realized much success. Some hot exciton materials have demonstrated high singlet conversion rates and high external quantum yields in OLED devices, which are very promising for practical applications. Simultaneously, the excellent singlet state conversion of hot exciton in OLEDs may provide a possible path to overcome challenge of electricity pumped organic laser devices, which is certainly worth further research.
The photocatalysis process involving hot carriers can overcome the Schottky barrier and reduce the photon energy required for photocatalysis. However, the observed charge transfer efficiencies in most reported systems are often low, and the stabilities are unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, despite these challenges, the research on hot carrier photocatalysis is currently attracting increasing attention. New breakthroughs in this field will rely on the delicate control of the fabrication of nanomaterials and their interface properties.
It worth noting that besides the above-discussed photophysical processes, there are other processes that may utilize hot excitons or hot carriers and potentially offer benefits in various applications, such as some triplet sensitizers based on ISC24 and some QD/dye solar cells,204 which still need further investigation to demonstrate their application potential. Additionally, a method for obtaining hot electrons through Mn2+-enhanced Auger process in QDs has recently attracted attention,205,206 which is worth further exploring in the field of photovoltaics and photocatalysis.207
In all the research related to hot exciton and hot carriers, the fundamental understanding of the photophysical processes occurring in the systems is crucial. However, because the lifetime of these energetic excitons and carriers is generally in the picosecond timescale, mechanism investigations into these short life-time species often require sophisticated time-resolved spectroscopic equipment. With the increasing accessibility to this type of equipment in the future, it is expected that deeper mechanistic understanding of the complicated photophysics will be achieved, which will effectively accelerate the discovery of critical mechanisms that can guide the performance optimization of the devices.
In summary, the research in the last decade has demonstrated that optoelectronic materials designed based on the concept of utilizing hot excitons and hot carriers are promising in many applications. It is foreseeable that this concept will play an increasingly important role in the design of high-performance optoelectronic materials and find applications with a broad scope.

10th anniversary
Happy 10th anniversary to J. Mater. Chem. C! 2022 has been very special for me, given that I was appointed an Associate Editor of J. Mater. Chem. C and Mater. Adv. in June 2022. Switching my role as an author to an editor has opened my eyes and allowed me to rethink what we expect for a high-quality manuscript. As an editor, I am constantly looking for novelty and impact in each submitted manuscript. I feel excited when reading a manuscript with a sparking new concept. This review article is directly related to my research on singlet fission materials, organic photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Importantly, this review is also an attempt to provide our new insights regarding the design of optoelectronic materials. From a unique perspective, we demonstrate to readers that three distinct applications (photovoltaics, OLEDs, and photocatalysis) may benefit from the same fundamental mechanism, i.e., taking advantage of high-energy excited state. I hope that readers will appreciate this review.
