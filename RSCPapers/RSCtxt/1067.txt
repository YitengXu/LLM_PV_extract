    , Accepted 15th June 2021First published on 16th June 2021AbstractPhenothiazine (PTZ) is one of the most extensively investigated S, N heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons due to its unique optical, electronic properties, flexibility of functionalization, low cost, and commercial availability. Hence, PTZ and its derivative materials have been attractive in various optoelectronic applications in the last few years. In this prospective, we have focused on the most significant characteristics of PTZ and highlighted how the structural modifications such as different electron donors or acceptors, length of the π-conjugated system or spacers, polar or non-polar chains, and other functional groups influence the optoelectronic properties. This prospective provides a recent account of the advances in phenothiazine derivative materials as an active layer(s) for optoelectronic (viz. dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), perovskite solar cells (PSCs), organic solar cells (OSCs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistor (OFETs), chemosensing, nonlinear optical materials (NLOs), and supramolecular self-assembly applications. Finally, future prospects are discussed based on the structure–property relationship in PTZ-derivative materials. This overview will pave the way for researchers to design and develop new PTZ-functionalized structures and use them for various organic optoelectronic applications.

1. Introduction
Optoelectronics is one of the fast-growing technologies that deal with applying electronic devices to the sourcing, detection, and control of light.1–4 This technology plays a critical role in survival and innovation in order to meet the electronic demands of the current generation.5,6 To transform light into an electrical signal or vice versa, optoelectronic devices depend on light matter interactions and the electronic properties of matter.7,8 These devices are used for numerous purposes such as telecommunications,9 military10 bio-medicals,11 microwave photonics,12 sensing,13 and other industries.14–16 To create better optoelectronic devices, there has always been a push to enhance light–matter interactions in semiconductor materials. In this context, better light-harvesting and good electron-carriage capable semiconducting material are well-suited for optoelectronics.17,18 In this regard, organic and inorganic materials have received significant attention due to their electronic as well as optical properties.19,20 However, in the past 25 years, there has been a surge of interest in the area of organic optoelectronics due to significant improvements in the material design, purification, cost, and room temperature solution processable deposition on large area or flexible substrates that have led to a significant increase in the material performance.21,22 In this aspect, many organic small molecules and polymers have been developed with various configurations such as D–D, D–π–D, D–π–A, A–π–A, and A–D–A.23–26 These patterns are made using various electron donors (triphenylamine, triazines, carbazole, phenothiazine, phenoxazine, benzo-dithiophene, etc.),27,28 acceptors (diketopyrrolopyrrol, perylenediimide, naphthalimide, isoindigo, etc.),29–31 spacers, (ethynyl, ethylene, phenyl, thiophene, furan, and porphyrin, etc.),32–34 side chains (alkyl, alkoxy ethers, crown ethers, etc.),32,35,36 and anchoring groups (CN, COOH, NO2, and other withdrawing groups).37,38 In fact, the aforementioned groups influence the physical, optical, electrical, electrochemical, and topological properties, changing the overall performance of the organic material as a result.28,35,36 Hence, chemical structure or pattern is a crucial factor in designing new organic materials for respective optoelectronic applications such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), nonlinear optics (NLO), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJ), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic solar cells (OSCs), perovskite solar cells (PSCs), molecular motors, batteries, biomedical, and sensors.23,39 In all these applications, the central core or donor strongly impacts their optoelectronic properties. In these aspects, S, N heterocyclic molecule, namely, phenothiazine (PTZ), is a well-known building block, which was firstly prepared from the reaction of diphenylamine with sulfur by Bernthsen40 in 1883.
Later on, many synthetic strategies were developed to build PTZ and its motifs with inexpensive starting materials for desired low-cost PTZ functionalized materials.41 In addition, PTZ has the following distinct structural characteristics, making it a well-known building block for optoelectronic applications.
1.1 Shape
The molecular shape has major impacts on the thermal stability, morphology of the film, packing, crystallinity, intermolecular interactions,23,39etc.; as a result, huge variation can be observed in their optoelectronic properties. Phenothiazine is a butterfly or bent-type non-planar conformation42 (see Fig. 1 side view) and these types of structural features hamper the formation of ground state aggregates and excimers. For instance, this kind of non-planar structure decreases the charge recombination and improves the DSSC device efficiency.43

1.2 Cost
Phenothiazine donor is a commercially available low-cost (0.07 $ per g) precursor when compared to other donor materials; triphenylamine (1.8 $ per g), carbazole (0.4 $ per g), phenoxazine (30 $ per g), indole (0.5 $ per g), benzo-dithiophene (187 $ per g).
1.3 Versatility of the chemical structure
Due to the simplicity of their chemistry, transparency, lightweight, etc., the design of organic materials by the respective applications is simple compared to inorganic materials.44,45 However, phenothiazine (PTZ) is an S, N heterotricyclic organic scaffold having multiple functional sites such as C-2, C-3, C-7, C-8, N10, and sulphur of the thiazine ring. Usually, the C3 and C7 positions are decorated with either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups and/or one electron-donating and one electron-withdrawing group; this design is based on its application, for example, D-PTZ-A and D-PTZ-D type chemical structures are most common in light-absorbing and hole-transporting materials in DSSC and PSCs, respectively.43,46 DFT calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PTZ are illustrated in Fig. 1 and their values are −5.24 and −0.68 eV, respectively, which are in good agreement with the experimental cyclic voltammetry results HOMO: −5.2 eV, LUMO: −1.6 eV).47 It is easy to tune the required energy levels for various optoelectronic devices by varying the substitutions on phenothiazine. Also, the N-10 active site of the PTZ core can be decorated with suitable solubilizing groups such as alkyl, oligo, aryl, or aralkyl to achieve the desired solubility in organic solvents and solution-processing properties. Furthermore, the PTZ core is easily oxidizable, especially at S, which transforms into sulphide, sulfoxide, or sulfone and can clearly indicate the loss of electrons from the yellow color region of the ESP maps23,39 (see Fig. 1). These chemical changes on PTZ generate a plethora of derivatives with tuneable optoelectronic properties.
With these preliminary features of PTZ, several functional materials can be produced that can be used in a huge number of applications. However, in this prospective, we have focused on a recent account of the development of PTZ-conjugated functional materials and structure–property relationships for active optoelectronic applications (including brief working principle). In particular, we focused on light-harvesting materials for DSSC and OPV, hole transporting materials for PSC, light-emitting materials for OLEDs, and hazardous material detection problems for sensing applications, also providing a brief overview of PTZ materials in OFET, NLO, and self-assembly applications. Finally, we discuss the most recent ideas for potential research directions in this area, as well as how the most promising molecular PTZ strategies can be tweaked to boost the performance of optoelectronic devices. In this prospective, we have indicated the codes PTZn (n = 1, 2, 3, …) for phenothiazine-based materials and NPTZn (n = 1, 2, 3, …) non-phenothiazine-based materials (only provided the photophysical data and not the structures).
2. Optoelectronic applications
2.1 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)
A DSSC is a complex system for light-to-electricity conversion, as with all solar cells. Fig. 2 demonstrates the basic components of the DSSC along with its operation mechanism. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are cheap, cost-effective, high-performance thin-film solar cells that operate on the basis of a semiconductor and an electrolyte.48 DSSC is an assembly of a working electrode (soaked with a dye) and a counter electrode (soaked with a thin layer of electrolyte) sealed with the help of a hot melt tape to prevent the leakage of the electrolyte. When exposed to sunlight, the dye sensitizer gets excited, from which an electron is injected into the conduction band (CB) of the mesoporous oxide. These generated electrons diffuse to the back contacts. Through the external circuit, the electrons reach the counter electrode, which enables the direct reduction of the electrolyte itself (I−/I3−) and subsequently reduces the oxidized dye molecules to their initial state.49,50
 Fig. 2  Typical DSSC component illustration and the working principle. 
However, the dye or the sensitizer is one of the essential components of the DSSC, which is responsible for the maximum absorption of incident light, resulting in better electrical current output to make an efficient DSSC. The general requirements for an ideal sensitizer are:51 (i) peripheral acid anchoring groups that allow firm adhesion to the surfaces of the semiconductor; (ii) the HOMO, which is far from the surface of CB of TiO2 as well as below the redox couple's energy level, to promote dye regeneration; (iii) high photo, thermal, and electrochemical stability; (iv) should be solution processable; (v) easy to synthesize and purify; (vi) should be low-cost and non-toxic, i.e., eco-friendly; (vii) hydrophobic in nature; (viii) to achieve effective solar photon harvesting, it should cover a wide portion of the visible spectrum and reach up to the NIR range with high molar extinction coefficients. Currently, dye sensitized solar panels transform ∼14% of the sunlight that hits them into electricity.52 Researchers are attempting to increase the efficiency by maintaining the above characteristics of the dye by its design and make it comparable to silicon-based solar panels. So far, inorganic ruthenium (Ru), metal-free organic, quantum-dot, zinc (Zn)–porphyrin, perovskites, and natural dyes are mainly used as the sensitizers due to their photovoltaic properties.43,53,54 Among them, Zn–porphyrin and metal-free organic sensitizers have proved their track record in terms of the efficiency and durability. Notably, phenothiazine-based metal-free and porphyrin sensitizers have drawn attention due to their distinct features such as strong electron donor, inexpensive, eco-friendly, non-planar butterfly structure, and simply tunable structures. Though the basic structure of sensitizers, i.e., D–π–A (donor–π–acceptor) has been established, there is a continuous effort and substantial progress has been made in new design architectures, for example, D–A–π–A, D–D–π–A, D–π–A–π–A, D–π–(A)n, and (D–π–A)n, for efficient DSSC.55,56 Jia et al., developed three (PTZ1, PTZ2, and PTZ3) stereoscopic D–A–π–A based phenothiazine dyes, with phenothiazine as the electron donor; spirobifluorene and octyl chains on phenothiazine were utilized to lessen the aggregation and suppress the charge recombination; benzothiadiazole unit (BTD) was utilized to expand the spectral responsiveness of these dyes; phenyl as well as thiophene were used as spacers and different anchoring groups, i.e., carboxylic acid in PTZ1, cyanoacrylic acid in PTZ2, and pyridine in PTZ3 dyes were prepared for the utilization in DSSC.57 This design strategy examined the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic performance of these dyes to scrutinize the influence of the above anchoring units. This study claims that cyanoacrylic acid group, followed by the carboxylic acid group, are efficient anchors to TiO2 while pyridine is a poor anchor to TiO2; as a result, PTZ2 shows good PCE of 7.34% than PTZ1 (6.69%) and PTZ3 (3.05%). Unlike, the above strategy, Nagarajan et al., introduced another type of structural architecture, viz., A′–D–π–A, where an auxiliary-acceptor (naphthalimide) is in one terminal and cyanoacrylic acid anchor in another terminal of the C3 and C7 position of the donor N-hexylphenothiazine.58 They have prepared two dyes by changing the changed alkyl chain length, i.e., ethyl (PTZ4) and propyl (PTZ5) on the nitrogen atom of naphthalimide, as shown in Chart 1. As a result, an improved JSC from 10.29mA cm−2 (propyl) to 12.21mA cm−2 (ethyl) was observed and efficiencies of 4.91% and 4.57%, respectively, were obtained. In another study, they used an ethynyl-pyrene unit at C-7 and cyanoacrylic acid or rhodanine-3-acetic acid anchoring units at the C-3 position of the C6 or C8 alkyl phenothiazine (PTZ6–11).59 Consequently, extending the conjugation results in enhanced absorbing ability and improved photovoltaic performance. Among them, PTZ7-based DSSCs exhibited high PCE of 7.45% and 12.10% in the absence and presence of the CDCA co-adsorbent, respectively (see Table 1).

Recently, our group also introduced four new D–π–A type metal-free organic sensitizers, where the donor phenanthroimidazole moiety at C-7 and either cyanoacetic acid (PTZ12 and PTZ13) or rhodanine 3-acetic acid (PTZ14 and PTZ15) acceptor units at the C-3 position of a hexylphenothiazine unit by varying the single/triple bond between phenanthroimidazole and phenothiazine, respectively60 (see Chart 1). These dyes displayed their absorption wavelength in the range of 220–650 nm in THF solvent and 400–750 nm on TiO2-coated film state (see Fig. 3(a)). These dyes show their efficiency in the range of 7.8% to 9.0% in the absence of a co-adsorbent, whereas enhanced efficiencies in the range of 8.4% to 10.2% in the presence of co-adsorbent were obtained. Among them, PTZ13 has demonstrated the highest efficiency of 10.2% compared to other (PTZ12, PTZ14, and PTZ15) sensitizers because of the fast re-generation of the oxidized dye from the redox couple (see Fig. 3(b)).
 Fig. 3  (a) Absorption (UV-Vis) and emission (PL) spectra in THF and (b) absorption spectra on nano-TiO2 films for PTZ-12 (D1), PTZ-13 (D2), PTZ-14 (D3), and PTZ-15 (D4) respectively. This figure was adapted from ref. 60. 
Similarly, multiple anchoring/acceptor-based metal-free-PTZ dyes are attractive in terms of their optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic performance. Recently, J. T. Lin and co-workers have used the double anchor concept and reported phenothiazine-based dyes (PTZ16–PTZ19) containing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) moiety as the N-substituent with different π-spacers (thiophene, 3-hexylthiophene, 4-hexyl-2,2′-bithiophene, and 4-heptyl-4-hexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene).61 The sensitizer PTZ19 showed a PCE of 9.79% and 10.90% without and with the co-adsorbent CDCA under AM 1.5 G, respectively. Under room-light illumination (Philips T5 lamp), the sensitizer PTZ19 showed high device efficiencies of 27.54%, 26.81%, and 24.98% at 187 lux, 597 lux, and 1025 lux, respectively, showing great potential toward the Internet of Things (IoTs). Recently, Cai and his co-workers reported three dianchoring-PTZ-based dyes and investigated the different connection π-bridges, namely, 3,3′-substituted 2,2′-dithiophene (PTZ20), 5,5′-substituted 2,2′-dithiophene (PTZ21), and encapsulated insulated molecular wire (EIMW) (PTZ22) between the C-7 position of two phenothiazine units.62 This study reveals that different linking positions have shown a major impact on the geometry of the dye molecules to suppress molecular aggregation as a result of improved PV performance. Among the three sensitizers, dithiophene-based PTZ21 dye shows the highest PCE of 7.5% (JSC = 14.52 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.76 V), which was due to its high light-harvesting capacity and moderate planarity, thus preventing the recombination of charges in the DSSC. This work highlights a new direction for the development of anti-aggregation dyes for DSSCs.
Further, phenothiazine in combination with porphyrin-based dyes in the D–π–A approach have showed promising alternatives to Ru(II)–polypyridyl complexes. Porphyrin-based dyes have attracted great attention due to their strong light harvesting capability and facile structural modification, and have demonstrated excellent optical and photovoltaic performance with a PCE of >13%.63 To date, phenothiazine–porphyrin64-based sensitizers have shown a PCE of 12.4%. In this context, our group has reported several phenothiazine–porphyrin-based dyes using D–π–A of A2B2 and A3B fashion for DSSC.43,65 We incorporated the donor phenothiazine at the meso phenyl position of a zinc porphyrin through the ethynyl bridge. In a systematic study, various auxiliary heteroaromatic acceptors are connected to the mesophenyl position of a zinc porphyrin through the ethynyl bridge (PTZ23 to PTZ33) to vary its optical and electronic properties.66 In all these sensitizers, the anchoring unit is either carboxylic acid or cyanoacyrlic acid, as illustrated in Chart 2. Among these sensitizers, the sensitizer PTZ27 having the thiophene auxiliary acceptor with cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group has shown red-shifted absorption with a narrow band gap, which allows the use of low-energy photons and the ability to generate higher JSC values. The IPCE is broad and reached 80% in the 400 to 700 nm region and the onset extends up to 900 nm, which resulted in outstanding JSC of 21 mA cm−2 and yielded up to 10.2% of PCEs. In another study, the PTZ27 sensitizer was prepared by studying the impact of the auxiliary acceptor, either thienothiophene (PTZ30) or dithienothiophene (PTZ31), with the view to improve the optical properties.67 The molar extinction coefficient of both PTZ30 and PTZ31 dyes was enhanced, when compared to the PTZ15 dye. Among them, PTZ30 showed a higher PCE (8.25%) than PTZ31 (7.01%) and under similar text cell conditions, and the PTZ27 sensitizer showed a PCE of 9.63%. Lower performance of the newly reported dyes was expected as the dye length increases in the order PTZ27 > PTZ30 > PTZ31; the recombination of the load may have accelerated in this order, resulting in a decrease in the efficiency (Chart 2 and Table 1).

In the same way, two other dyes, coded as PTZ32 and PTZ33, were developed in the same way as that for the previously reported PTZ26 and PTZ27 dyes.68 BDT was linked with the view of increasing the co-planarity between the two adjacent units through non-covalent interactions as a result of extending the π-conjugation, light-harvesting ability, and facilitating charge transfer. Device studies demonstrate that PCE of 1.86% and 1.37% was obtained for PTZ32 and PTZ33 dyes, respectively. In contrast, Xie and his group developed a series of new doubly strapped porphyrin dyes PTZ34–PTZ37 with systematic modification (at C7 and N10 position)69 of the phenothiazine donor with the view of further suppressing dye aggregation and charge recombination (see Chart 3). Efficiencies of the optimized devices represented in the increasing order were XW40 (9.3%) < PTZ35 (9.5%) < PTZ34 (9.7%) < PTZ36 (10.1%) < PTZ37 (11.1%) with their improved VOC values of 0.73, 0.753, 0.755, 0.761, and 0.781 V for XW40, PTZ35, PTZ34, PTZ36, and PTZ37, respectively (see Table 1). Compared to the other dyes, PTZ37 has a bulky donor with alkoxyl chains more evenly distributed, which tends to form a more compact self-assembled monolayer to prevent I3 penetration. As a result, the charge recombination of the electrolyte between I3 and the electrons injected into TiO2 was suppressed. By continuing their efforts for developing efficient DSSCs, they designed a class of concerted companion dyes with two complementary dye components connected covalently (see Chart 3). In this strategy, they developed four new PTZ-porphyrins from recently reported PTZ37 associated with newly synthesized organic dye Z2 via versatile chains with different lengths64 to provide PTZ38–PTZ41. These dyes have outstanding absorption and PCEs in the range of 8.8–11.7%. Remarkably, the CDCA co-adsorbent further improves the PCE of 12.4% for PTZ39 using liquid I−/I3− electrolyte-based DSSCs. At the time of this report, it was the highest recorded efficiency for iodine electrolyte-based DSSCs (see Fig. 4 and Table 1).

2.2 Perovskite solar cells (PSCs)
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a new paradigm for efficiently capturing solar energy. Within the span of 10 years, the solar conversion efficiency was increased from 3.8% to 25.5%.70,71 The operation mechanism of a PSC depends on the device configuration. Although it was initially proposed to be similar to a DSSC cell where a single dye layer is absorbed on the mp-TiO2, in a PSC, the perovskite is usually filled into the porous TiO2. As a result, electrons can be transported via both the perovskite layer and the mp-TiO2 layer.72 The schematic picture of the working mechanism and the charge transfer processes of a normal planar PSC is demonstrated in Fig. 5. The common PSC device architecture consists of 5 components:26 (i) transparent electrode, (ii) Electron Transporting Material (ETM), (iii) light-active perovskite, (iv) Hole Transporting Material (HTM), and (v) metallic electrode. However, ambipolar behavior perovskites led to the development of new configurations and materials for PSCs. In this sense, perovskites could be used cumulatively as light absorber, electron conductor, and hole conductor. Therefore, the PSC architecture can be classified as either regular (n–i–p) or inverted (p–i–n) configurations, based on the properties of the first material encountered by the incident light, or the first deposited material (HTM or ETM) on FTO/ITO, which is adjacent to the perovskite layer.
 Fig. 5  Working mechanism and principle of a perovskite solar cells. This figure was adapted from ref. 72. 
The following desirable (a–c) and undesirable events (d–g) may occur upon illumination of the PSC.25
(a) Photo-excitation of the perovskite induces charge separation (electrons and holes).
(b) Electron injection into the CB of ETL (TiO2), followed by the migration of the e− into the FTO.
(c) Hole injection into the HOMO of the HTM, followed by migration of the holes into the counter electrode.
(d) Non-radiative recombination.
(e) Charge recombination between the electron from the ETL (TiO2) and a hole in the perovskite.
(f) Charge recombination between an electron in the perovskite and a hole in the HTM.
(g) Interfacial TiO2/HTM recombination.
Many research groups have been focused on improving the efficiency by either changing the hole or electron transporting materials, modifying the light harvesters, or using the latest deposition techniques. In fact, the hole transporting material (HTM) is one of the main components in the PSC since it is not only involved in charge transport but also protects the perovskite. The widely used HTM in PSC is spiro-OMeTAD and the device efficiency has crossed 25%. However, a major hurdle for spiro-OMeTAD is its high expense owing to tedious synthetic protocols, and its thermal instability. Hence, the development of an ideal HTM is required for further improvement in efficient and stable perovskite solar cells, having the following properties:73 (i) suitable HOMO–LUMO energy levels; (ii) high hole mobility/conductivity; (iii) capable of smooth film formation; (iv) should be solution processable; (v) easy to synthesize and purify; (vi) should be low-cost and non-toxic, i.e., eco-friendly; (vii) hydrophobic in nature; (viii) chemically and thermally stable.
In recent years, PTZ can be used as a substitution or central core for the molecular engineering of efficient HTMs.46 Also, S,N-based heterocycles structure serving as “molecular locks” to network strongly with under-coordinated Pb2+ ions were recently reported to be appropriate additives for efficient PSCs.74 Versatile structural modification of phenothiazine directs the development of various topological structure-based hole transport materials,26viz., D–π–D, D–π–A, D–A–D, D–π–D–π–A, D–A–D–π–A, D–π–A–π–D, D–A–D–A–D, and A–π–D–π–D–π–A, where, D-donor, A-acceptor, and π-electron conjugation spacer. Zhao et al., introduced three HTMs with the D–A–D structure, in which dithienopyrrolobenzothiadiazole acts as an acceptor and phenothiazine (PTZ42, see Chart 4) or triarylamines (NPTZ1 & NPTZ2) are the donors.75 As expected, the phenothiazine unit holds its planarity, the alkyl groups present on PTZ improve the π–π interaction, and Pb–S bonding occurs, leading to a device efficiency for PTZ42 of 14.2%. Under similar conditions, the PCE was 7.0%, 10.2%, and 14.9% for NPTZ1, NPTZ2, and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. As per earlier discussions, another possibility of functionalization on the PTZ unit is the conversion of an electron-donating sulfur atom to an electron-withdrawing sulfone. With this concept, Cheng et al., introduced two new phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide (PDO)-based inexpensive HTMs, PTZ43 (62.1791 $ per g)) and PTZ44 (61.2761 $ per g) (see Chart 4). In this design, they varied the N-position of POD with anisole and 4,4′-dimethoxytriphenylamine but retained the 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine as the side arms (3- and 7-positions); consequently, the resulting molecules possess a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) structure.76 With the introduction of sulfuryl, particularly appropriate energy level alignment and excellent charge carrier mobility were obtained. The device was fabricated with the device structure of FTO/c-TiO2/SnO2/P(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/HTM/Au), where PTZ43 and PTZ44 were used as the HTMs. The observed PCEs were 16.7%, 20.2%, and 19.8% for the PTZ43, PTZ44, and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. A high PCE of the PTZ44-based PSC is ascribed to the more planar geometry of the PDO core group as well as much stronger molecular stacking behavior. Device stability tests of the respective PSCs were performed (relative humidity of 30–45%, rt) up to 480 h aging without encapsulation; as a result, PTZ43, PTZ44, and spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs sustained 84.6%, 84.7%, and 80.1% of the initial PCEs, respectively.
 Chart 4  Chemical structures of phenothiazine (PTZ)-based HTMs for doped and dopant-free PSC devices. 
To date, most of the high-performance HTMs require a sophisticated doping process to ensure their reasonable hole-transporting properties. Regrettably, the dopants used and the related oxidation reactions have been shown to severely degrade the long-term stability of the device.77 Thus, PTZ-based dopant-free PSC has drawn great attention. Very recently, Tsang et al. introduced two new D–π–D HTMs, coded as PTZ45 and NPTZ3, which consist of 4,8-di(hexylthio)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as the π-conjugated unit with N-(6-bromohexyl) phenothiazine (PTZ) and N-(6-bromohexyl)phenoxazine (POZ) as the donor side arms, respectively.78 They were used to make the dopant-free inverted MAPbI3 devices using (PTZ45) as the HTM, exhibiting a PCE of 18.26%; that of NPTZ3 was even higher, reaching 19.16%. In particular, dopant-free characteristics and hydrophobicity of both PTZ45 and BDT-POZ HTMs exhibit superior long term (400 h) stability with a loss of only 20% of its initial PCE but with the same experimental conditions; PTAA loses ∼36% of its initial PCE. These results further demonstrate the potential of the inexpensive NPTZ3 ($44.57) and PTZ45 ($59.22) as promising HTMs in PSCs. On the other hand, our group reported the new phenothiazine appended porphyrin macrocyclic based HTMs with and without the dopant PSC. With the D–π–D pattern, N-octyl phenothiazine as the donor, and octyl alkoxy porphyrin as the π-conjugated linker PTZ46 (free-base) and PTZ47 (Zn) by varying the metal centers. Screen-printing processed device fabrication of dopant-free PTZ46 and PTZ47 HTMs gave a higher Jsc of 19.66 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.00 V, and PCE of 11.26% when compared to PTZ46-based PSC (Jsc of 16.59 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.954 V, and PCE of 9.68%).79 This was the best reported PCE at the time in a porphyrin hole-transport layer (HTL)-based PSCs using a carbon–graphene composite as the cathode. Later on, Cu metal was introduced into the same system and these molecular systems were introduced into pre-made PSC-without a HTM by a simple infiltration process via the front contact layer. Among them, PTZ48 PSC displayed the highest PCE of 11.76% without dopant and 12.88% with dopants when compared to other HTMs (PTZ46, PTZ47).80
X. Ding et al., developed two phenothiazine (PTZ) core building block-based hole transport material-functionalized side arms with two 4,4′-dimethoxytriphenylamine and N-substitution with and without pyridine, coded as PTZ49 and PTZ50 respectively.81 These HTMs were prepared via Buchwald–Hartwig reaction, radical substitution, followed by Suzuki–Miyaura reactions with the inexpensive synthetic cost of HTMs PTZ49 (69.50 $ per g) and PTZ50 (76.20 $ per g), which are considerably lower than that of the conventional spiro-OMeTAD (∼200 $ per g). With the introduced pyridine unit, PTZ49 can greatly influence the energy levels, charge carrier mobility, as well as film-forming capacity. In addition, the pyridine unit can create solid Pb–N interactions between PTZ49 and the perovskite as well as effectively passivate the under-coordinated Pb2+ defects on the perovskite surface (see Fig. 6). The surface defects of the perovskite, in turn, improve the efficiency of power conversion (PCE) and stability of the PSC device. As a result, pyridine-functionalized PTZ49-based PSC exhibited high PCE of 19.9% compared to non-pyridine PTZ50 (13.2%) and similar PCE when compared to spiro-OMeTAD (19.9%). Interestingly, when employing PTZ49 as the interface modification layer between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD, the PCE was further enhanced to 22.1% and preserved around 90% initial efficiency after 1000 h aging in ambient conditions. This study shows that the incorporation of passive functional units into the HTM is an effective molecular design and engineering strategy for developing most efficient HTMs and interfacial materials. Very recently, commercially available PTZ was directly introduced into the perovskite (MAPbI3) as a Lewis base additive to check its passivation effect in PSCs by Wu et al.74 The strong interaction between PTZ and Pb2+ ions resulted in diminished defect density and high crystallinity of the perovskite layer was observed. Finally, the modified devices displayed an improved PCE of 15.50% as compared to that of the control device (14.38%). This study points to the synergetic effect of PTZ on the growth and passivating defects for obtaining efficient PSCs.

This figure was adapted from ref. 81. 
Unlike, the above concepts, Lu et al., developed three PTZ-based “A–π–D–π–D–π–A” type HTMs with multifunctional features such as efficient hole extraction, trap passivation, and hydrophobic layer and achieved it introducing a thiophene spacer and various electron acceptors, viz., N-methyl rhodamine (NMR), dicyanovinylene (DCV), and 1,3-indanedione (IND), coded as PTZ51, PTZ52, and PTZ53, respectively82 (see Chart 5). In this chemical configuration, two PTZ donor entities were incorporated to lower the HOMO energy level, hole transport, thermal stability, and decrease the aggregation tendency of their non-planar, butterfly shaped geometry; N-dodecyl chains on the PTZ units enhanced the solubility, hydrophobicity, and hole mobility of HTM by the strong π–π stacking of the molecules via possible hydrophobic interactions. The central thiophene π-bridge unit was introduced between two PTZ entities to enhance the planarity by alleviating the torsional distortion between them as well as strengthening the hole transport; end-capped acceptors (Lewis base blocks) on both sides for improving the hole extraction and the passivation of under-coordinated Pb ions; the device fabricated with these HTMs using the FTO/compact-TiO2/meso-TiO2/CH3NH3PbCl3−xIx/HTMs/Au architecture results only in PTZ52 possessing all the aforementioned multifunctional features, consequently exhibiting a high and comparable PCE of 17.3% compared to the reference spiro-OMeTAD (18.01%), PTZ51 (3.62%), and PTZ53 (10.01%) respectively. This is mainly ascribed to N-methylrhodamine in PTZ51 and 1,3-indanedione in PTZ53, which majorly reduced the band gap through the significant destabilization of the HOMO, leading to an increased energy level offset related to PTZ52 (see Table 2).

2.3 Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs)
An organic photovoltaic cell (OPV) is one of the most promising photovoltaic revolutions to increase the performance and resilience of solar cells owing not just to its low expense, solution-processing, lightweight, stability, etc., but also to a dramatic improvement in its certified efficiency (∼18.2%).83 A standard OPV system consists of one or more photoactive materials sandwiched between two electrodes (see Fig. 7) and generates photocurrent by the following process.84,85 (i) Light absorption: photoactive materials absorb sunlight and form the excitons, in which the electrons are excited from the valence band/HOMO into the conduction band/LUMO; (ii) exciton diffusion: excitons diffuse to the donor/acceptor interface due to the concentration gradient; (iii) charge separation: separate into free holes and electrons; (iv) charge extraction: holes and electrons travel to the corresponding electrodes by following either donor or acceptor phase; as a result photocurrent is produced.86
 Fig. 7  (a) General BHJ-OSCs architecture and (b) charge transport phenomena in donor–acceptor blend. This figure was adapted from ref. 85. 
Typical OPVs comprise of p-type (polymer or small molecule donors) and n-type (fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors) semiconductors, blended in a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) configuration.87 D/A heterojunctions can be created with two main types of architectures, namely, bilayer heterojunction and bulk heterojunction (BHJ). In fact, the first OSC reported by Tang in 1986 with a bilayer structure had copper phthalocyanine as the donor (D) and perylene derivative as the acceptor (A); as a result, the device exhibited a PCE of 0.95% under simulated AM2 illumination of 75 mW cm−2.88 From then, the efficiency OPVs has been improved considerably in the past 18 years, from 4% in 2002 to 18% by 2020.89 For this achievement of OPVs, considerable contribution was demonstrated by PTZ-based materials. As discussed in Section 1, the distinct features of PTZ make for the design of its derivatives either as p-type or n-type materials in OSCs. In this section, we cover the recent literature related to PTZ-based donors and acceptors (see Charts 6 and 7) as well as summarize their photovoltaic properties in Table 3.

(i) Polymers and small molecular-based PTZ donors. 
Polymers have various advantages such as they form quality films, have smooth morphology, and can easily be used to make large-area flexible solar panels. Various organic chromophore-functionalized polymeric materials have been used as electron donors to achieve a high PCE (∼14%) of OSCs. PTZ-based polymers were used as a donor (for the first time in the year 2006) in BHJ solar cells and reported by Shim and co-workers. They developed a series of PTZ-copolymers PF-PZBx (x = 10, 30, 40, 50) comprising fluorene and cyanovinylene-functionalized hexylphenothiazine materials as the electron donors.90 By the combination of a blend of PTZ54 and the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), the D/A system showed a PCEs up to 0.53%. Later, Huang and co-workers reported the same polymer (PTZ55) with an enhanced device performance (PCE of 1.84%).91 In fact, polymeric donors are comparatively less studied than small molecules because of the batch-to-batch variations during synthesis, ambiguous synthetic reproducibility, and tedious purification procedures. Alternatively, small molecules have earned considerably attention in the past few years due to their well-defined molecular structure, definite molecular weight, facile tunability, easy purification, better synthetic reproducibility, excellent light harvesting properties, and high molar extinction coefficients. Recently, Revoju et al. reported three small molecules PTZ56, PTZ57, and PTZ58 as electron donors with PTZ as the core building block connected to benzothiadiazole and the 3-ethylrhodanine acceptor group via the thiophene π-spacer92 (see Chart 6). Oligo-ether side chain-substituted PTZ57 and PTZ58 molecules displayed a bathochromic shift (long-wavelength) absorption band in thin films, smaller π–π stacking distances, higher dielectric constant, and higher hole mobilities, when compared to the alkyl side chain substituted PTZ56. Optimized devices based on PTZ58 showed a relatively higher PCE (7.16%) compared to that of PTZ57 (6.62%) and PTZ56 (3.95%), as displayed in Table 3. The authors ascribed the superior performance of PTZ58/PTZ57 to the higher enhancement in Jsc and FF originating from the formation of nanoscale domains of the donor and acceptor, resulting in inefficient charge separation, balanced charge transport, and suppressed charge recombination. In addition, these results reveal that the nature of the side chains has a reflective impact on the molecular and photovoltaic properties.
Singh and his group studied the optical, electrochemical, theoretical, morphological, and device properties with respect to the molecular structure of the donor. In one study, they reported two symmetrical D–π–A–π–D configured organic small molecular donors containing diketopyrrolopyrrole accepting unit, ethylhexylphenothiazine as the terminal donor units, and cyano group with double bonds, followed by phenyl/thiophene or phenyl/furan as the π-bridge, coded as PTZ59 and PTZ60, respectively.93 Higher λonset absorption of PTZ59 (726 nm) was observed when compared to that of PTZ60 (700 nm) on the thin films due to strong intermolecular π–π interaction attained from the highly conjugated backbone structure. The OSCs fabricated with PTZ59 showed a higher PCE of 5.2% than those employing PTZ60 (4.0%) owing to a broad spectral range (see Fig. 8) and better morphology. In another study, the same group synthesized two NIR aza-BODIPY-based small molecules (see Chart 6), where phenothiazine and phenoxazine are the terminal linkers and aza-BODIPY is the central core, namely, PTZ61 and phenoxazine (NPTZ4). These two materials displayed panchromatic absorption in the range of 300 to 1000 nm wavelength.94 The optimized BHJ solar devices based on PTZ61 and NPTZ4 exhibited overall PCEs of 8.23% and 7.24%, respectively, which is credited to mainly higher values of Jsc and FF. The higher value of Jsc and FF was attributed to the efficient balanced charge transport, efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, and suppressed bimolecular recombination. In a similar way, Cooke's group introduced three BODIPY-based donors featuring PTZ moieties as the electron donating units at the meso (PTZ62 and PTZ64) and α-positions (PTZ63) linker,95 as shown in Chart 6. All three dyes displayed excellent panchromatic absorption covering the spectra up to 850 nm with a high εmax (4.4–6.3 × 10−4 cm−1 M−1). Optimized D:A weight ratio (1:3), small molecule PTZ64:PC71BM with PTZ core at the α-position, and nitrobenzene at the meso-position led to the highest PCE of 1.71% (see Table 3).

(ii) As acceptors. 
Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are widely used fullerene-based acceptors (FA) in BHJ solar cells owing to their high electron mobility, strong propensity to accept the donor electron, and ability to form favorable donor nanoscale networks. In view of these advantages, few examples of PTZ-fullerene dyads have been reported in the literature. Mi and co-authors developed N-hexylphenothiazine-appended fullerene (PTZ65) as the acceptor (see Chart 7) and then combined it with the P3HT-electron donor; the device was fabricated with the following configuration: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTZ-C60:P3HT/LiF/Al.96 The best device parameter was Voc of 0.608 V, Jsc of 4.393 mA cm−2, and PCE of 1.29%, respectively. The authors attributed the superior performance of PTZ65 to higher enhancement in the Voc because its LUMO energy level is higher than that of C60. In the same way, D’Souza and his group introduced other three (PTZ66, PTZ67, and PTZ68) PTZ-fullerene acceptors; where the fulleropyrrolidine linking was at C-3 or at the N-position of PTZ, the resulting structures are displayed in Chart 7. Fig. 9 displays the energy level diagram, device architecture, and I–V profiles of the acceptor materials PTZ66, PTZ67, and PTZ68. Among them acceptor PTZ67 (C-3 ring-substituted PTZ65 having a polyethylene glycol unit) shows a higher PCE of 3.5%. This was due to the optimum morphology of BHJ between the donor-P3HT and the PTZ67, which was further facilitated by the successful separation of intramolecular charge and the relatively slow recombination of charge promoted by PTZ67 within the structure of BHJ.97

However, fullerene-based acceptors not only face expensive synthesis and tedious purification procedures but also, the lack of absorption in the NIR-region and limited tunable HOMO/LUMO energy levels lead to no further improvement in the efficiency. Alternatively, non-fullerene acceptors (NFA) have been developed, which show favorable electron transport properties as well as broad absorption over the visible to NIR region and energy level tunability. In this context, Sharma et al. introduced PTZ-carbazole based NFA (PTZ69) and applied it as NFA in a BHJ organic solar cell made from P3HT:PTZ69 (1:1); the active layer shows an efficiency of 2.80%.98 Further, the device PCE was improved from 2.80% to 4.16% when a thin layer of TiO2 was introduced between the photoactive layer and the Al electrode (see Table 3).
The enhanced PCE was attributed to a more balanced charge transport, which increases the charge collection efficiency. As per the theoretical (DFT) designed strategy by Ahmed et al., it is urged to develop new PTZ-NFAs and improve their device performance.

2.4 Organic field-effect transistor (OFET)
In the year 1930, the phenomenon of a field-effect transistor (FET) was first proposed and received a patent by Julius Edgar. Later, Tsumura et al., reported an organic thiophene polymer-based FETs, also known as an organic field-effect transistor (OFET).99 An OFET is a three-electrode switching system controlled by voltage. The device consists of an organic semiconductor, an insulator between the semiconductor and gate electrode, and three terminals (source, drain, and gate).100 The general device architecture is shown in Fig. 10 and functions as follows. When a gate voltage is pulsed, the carriers assemble near the dielectric layer or organic layer interface and form a conductive channel. From the source electrode, carriers are then injected into the organic layer and transport takes place via a conductive channel to the drain electrode.
 Fig. 10  General schematic device architecture of the OFET. 
OFETs are an integral element of organic electronics for the next generation. They are dynamic components in display technology, wearable electronics, smart bandages, electronic papers, radio frequency identification tags (RFIDs), and various sensing applications. Both p-and n-type OFETs are crucial for the application of organic electronics. In this context, most of the high mobility polymers and organic small molecular D–A systems were reported, where, donors (D): phenothiazine, carbazole, etc., and acceptors (A): naphthalenediimide (NDI), naphthalene monoimide (NDI), perylene diimide (PDI) diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), isoindigo (IID), etc.101 However, many factors such as the HOMO/LUMO energy level, packing mode on the film state, size/molecular weight, impurities of organic semiconductors including device configuration, morphology, and interface influence the OFET properties; however, there is no doubt that the key factor is the semiconductor itself.
Kim et al. reported a series of p-type semiconductors based on phenothiazylene vinylene and bithiophene copolymers (PTZ70, PTZ71, and PTZ72) for organic thin-film transistors (see Chart 8).102 A readily accessible dialkoxy-substituted phenylene ring was inserted into the phenothiazine units to improve the solubility of the polymers. These polymers showed outstanding thermal stability (see Table 4) and all showed decomposition temperatures above 400 °C. Two strong absorption peaks in the wavelength ranges of 306–325 nm from the phenothiazine unit and 430–480 nm from the π–π transition were observed in both the solution and thin film spectra. The optimized field-effect mobilities for PTZ70, PTZ71, and PTZ72 were calculated to be 1.8 × 10−4, 5.7 × 10−4, and 2.5 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the equivalent on/off ratios of 5 × 102, 1 × 104, and 5 × 102, respectively; the PTZ72-based device showed the lowest carrier mobility when compared to that of PTZ70 and PTZ71, which may be attributed to the twisting between the 3,31-position of the dialkylated thiophene rings. In continuation, the same group developed two new PTZ-based organic semiconductors by introducing the benzothiadiazole auxiliary acceptor between the two thiophene rings in the above PTZ71 and PTZ72 polymers to get low-band-gap polymers (PTZ73 and PTZ74), respectively.103 The FET devices were processed in solution and made a bottom contact configuration for the above polymers. PTZ73 and PTZ74 showed excellent hole mobilities of 7.5 × 10−5 and 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with on/off ratios of about 104. The hole mobility for PTZ74 was found to be a little higher than that of PTZ73 due to the greater steric crowding between the phenothiazine and alkylated DTBT (di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) units in PTZ73, which led to poor polymer chain packing, resulting in the lower mobility of PTZ73 and PTZ74 (see Table 4).

Recently, the same group reported two more new phenothiazine-linked diketopyrrolopyrrole donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers, where N of the PTZ was decorated with triphenylamine (PTZ75) and pyrene (PTZ76) moieties (see Chart 8). Both PTZ75- and PTZ76-conjugated polymers showed λmax at 625 nm and 650 nm and molar extinction coefficients (ε) of 1.7 × 104 and 2.1 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively.104 Also, λmax of ∼700 nm and λonset of ∼810 nm were observed in the solid state due to strong intermolecular π–π stacking interactions and rigid structures in the solid-state. Thus, the corresponding optical band gaps were 1.53 eV for both the conjugated polymers. The p-type top contact OFET was fabricated with PTZ75 and PTZ74 polymer solution via spin-coating on the silicon wafer substrate. Fig. 11 shows the drain current (ID) versus the drain voltage (VDS) characteristics at different gate voltages for OFETs of (a) PTZ75 (PDABPP) and (b) PTZ76, respectively. Furthermore, PTZ75 and PTZ76 exhibited hole mobilities of 2 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (see Table 4). The AFM morphology of both the polymers displayed in Fig. 11(c) and (d) reveals that PTZ76's surface was smoother than that of PTZ75's. The whole film surface analysis showed that uniform structures with high roughnesses could be derived from crystalline domains.

In the same direction, the progress of n-type polymer semiconductors have lagged far behind that of their p-type counterparts. In spite of this, several n-type polymer semiconductors have also been recently published and some of them display high n-type charge transport properties of OFET. Zhou et al., reported a series of novel n-type naphthalene diimide (NDI)/perylene diimide (PDI) and phenothiazine (PTZ)-based copolymers with different side-chain lengths and molecular weights,105 where phase-transfer catalyst (Aliquat-336) was used either to improve the molecular weight or reduce the polydispersity index of the polymers. As a result, three (PTZ77-L, PTZ78-L, and PTZ79-L) low molecular weight (Mn < 7000) copolymers obtained without using Aliquat 336 while the other three (PTZ77-H, PTZ78-H, and PTZ79-H) high molecular weight (Mn ∼ 7800–11800) copolymers obtained with Aliquat-336 and related chemical structures are shown in Chart 8. The polymers with higher Mn display a relative bathochromic shift of the absorption wavelengths, stronger π–π stacking, more uniform film morphology, higher decomposition temperature, and higher electron mobility than those with lower Mn. Moreover, n-type FET was fabricated with bottom-gate top-contact geometry based on these copolymers displayed electron mobilities as high as 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1 with on/off ratios as high as 105 in N2.
2.5 Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)
Since the groundbreaking research of Tang and Van Slyke in 1987, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have received increasing attention due to their incredible applications in display and lighting technologies.106 An additional benefit of OLEDs lies in bendable and adaptable (flexible) display applications, which is crucial for the recent transformation in the paradigm toward flexible electronics. However, it is necessary to further improve the durability of the large area displays to maintains quality images. OLEDs can be divided into three sets:107 (i) fluorescent OLEDs (FLOLED), (ii) phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLED), and (iii) thermally activated delayed fluorescence OLEDs (TADF-OLEDs). Usually, all these devices are assembled from the following layers: cathode, electron injection layer (EIL), electron transport layer (ETL), emission layer (EML), hole transport layer (HTL), hole injection layer (HIL), and anode. As shown in the schematic representation of the OLED device (Fig. 12), where voltage is applied to the OLED electrodes, holes are injected and transported from the anode, whereas electrons are injected and transported from the cathode. Excitons (hole and electron pairs) are combined in the emitting layer (EML) and those produced at this time are changed to ground state and generate light.108
 Fig. 12  General OLED device working mechanism. 
In reality, for effective and long-life OLEDs, the molecular structure, solubility, thermal stability, morphology, energy levels, and good transport properties of each layer are of a major concern.109 In this regard, PTZ derivatives have greater interest due to their strong emissive (cover almost all the CIE color space), hole, and electron transport properties. Thus, in this section, we have summarized the recent literature on PTZ derivatives for OLEDs.23,39

(i) Fluorescent OLEDs (FLOLED). 
Xue et al., developed two new D–A type blue emitters using 10-ethyl-phenothiazine as a donor and either 1,4,5-triphenyl-1H-imidazole or phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazole as an acceptor; as a result, PTZ80 and PTZ81 were obtained, respectively110 (see Chart 9). These molecules were used as emitting layers in FLOLED in non-doped devices and displayed a bluer emission (λEL = 460 nm) than that for PTZ81 (λEL = 476 nm). Owing to this, the PTZ81-based device exhibited a maximum power efficiency of 4.00 lm W−1, a maximum current efficiency of 7.20 cd A−1, and better external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3.41% with CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.34) when compared to the PTZ80-based device EQE of 2.38% and luminous efficiency of 3.44 cd A−1 with CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.19), as summarized in Table 5. This large difference was ascribed to the rigid and flexible structure of the acceptor units. Similarly, the same group developed two other blue-emitting molecules by introducing the phenyl group in the above PTZ69-based D–A system. Here, an acceptor component was connected through the para and meta-position of the phenyl in order to regulate the degree of conjugation in the PTZ emitters.111 They found that non-doped devices using PTZ82 exhibit a higher maximum EQE of 4.14%, LEmax of 11.06 cd A−1, λEL = 496 nm than that of PTZ83 (EQE = 2.23%, LEmax of, 3.52 cd A−1, λEL= 464 nm). On the other hand, the doped PTZ83-based device displayed deep blue emission with CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.17), a maximum EL emission peak at 460 nm (Fig. 13), and a maximum EQE of 3.96%, whereas doped PTZ82 displayed EQE of 3.99%, LEmax of 8.82 cd A−1, and λEL = 484 nm with CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.36). The enhanced color purity of the doped-PTZ82 system is likely to be derived from the suppression of the tight packing of the PTZ82 molecules in the emitting layer and the intense intermolecular interactions at the interfaces. Very recently, a new D–A–D type red fluorescent emitter, PTZ84, was synthesized as a part of their efforts to achieve highly efficient PTZ OLEDs, where phenothiazine and triphenylamine were used as the donors (Ds) and benzothiadiazole as the acceptor (A)112 (see Chart 9). The non-doped PTZ84 device exhibited red light emission at 656 nm, EQE of 1.62% with CIE coordinates of (0.65, 0.32), and the exciton utilization reached a value of 50%. This design strategy of AIE combined with HLCT reveals the great potential for the development of effective D–A–D type red-light fluorescent emitters. Wu et al., introduced a series of D–A and D–A–D type bipolar fluorescence emitters, namely, NPTZ5, NPTZ6, PTZ85, and PTZ86 (see Chart 9) using phenothiazine and 9,9-diphenyl-9,10-dihydroacridine units as the donor while oxadiazole unit as the acceptors.113 These molecules exhibit high thermal stability (358 °C to 455 °C) due to the higher rigidity of its molecular structures. The emission peak was observed for NPTZ6 and NPTZ5 at 450 nm, for PTZ86 at 540 nm, and for PTZ85 at 550 nm. They fabricated two different devices using two different host materials such as bis[2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-pyridine]beryllium (Bepp2) and bis[2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl]ether oxide (DPEPO). The overall device performances with Bepp2 were considerably higher than that of the device with DPEPO. However, the phenothiazine donor-based emitters, especially PTZ85, showed excellent EQE of 3.99%, better current and power efficiencies of 10.10 cd A−1 and 6.88 lm W−1 with CIE coordinates of (0.40, 0.53), respectively, when compared to other PTZ and acridine derivatives due to their strong donating power (see Table 5). This study reveals that the balance charge donating and withdrawing nature are very crucial for bipolar fluorescence emitters to achieve efficient OLEDs.

(ii) Phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLED). 
In commercialized OLEDs, phosphorescent emitters have been commonly used because they can achieve nearly 100% internal quantum efficiency (IQE) by utilizing all the triplet and singlet excitons.114 In particular, phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) are superior and have been used extensively in mobile phones. It is now widely believed that PhOLEDs, possessing transition metal compounds as emitters, have drawn much interest since they can maintain high efficiency of light emission by harvesting all singlet and triplet excitons. However, despite the massive development made so far, PhOLEDs still face some challenges and issues, such as their low efficiency, short lifetime, high-quality blue emission light, complicated manufacturing, and quest for improved photo-functional OLED materials.115 The choice of the right host is the key to achieving high-performance PhOLEDs as hosts are responsible for balancing the transfer of charges and containment of hole-electron pairs within the emitting layer (EML) (Fig. 14). As of now, three types of hosts are considered to realize efficient PhOLEDs, including monopolar hosts (mCP and CBP), bipolar hosts (carbazole, benzimidazole, phenothiazine,), and co-hosts. However, bipolar hosts have gained significant attention in PhOLEDs fabrication since these hosts not only make the electric flux high and balanced with a single small molecule (containing donor and acceptor) but also simplify the device structure.116 Lee et al., reported three D–A type high triplet energy host materials (PTZ87, PTZ88, and PTZ89) derived from phenothiazine dioxide and carbazole units.117 These materials could transport both holes and electrons effectively and demonstrated high triplet energy for use in blue PhOLEDs. The maximum EQEs of the devices using F2Irpic as the dopant was 16.9%, 24.3%, and 9.4% for PTZ87, PTZ88, and PTZ89, respectively (see Table 6). Compared to the other two, the higher EQE of the PTZ76 unit was clarified by the high triplet energy and balanced carrier density. Tan et al., used Ir(piq)2(acac) emitters together with phenothiazine–triazine-based bipolar charge transporters (PTZ90, PTZ91, and PTZ92).118 As a result, they obtained red PhOLED containing the compound PTZ90 as a host, which exhibited a maximum EQE of 10.3% and low-efficiency roll-offs of 1% at 1000 cd m−2. Similarly, Ran et al., used (Ir(MDQ)2(acac)) dopant together with nitrile-containing TPA-PTZ based bipolar host compounds (NPTZ7, NPTZ8, and PTZ93).119 Consequently, they obtained red PhOLED containing the compound PTZ (PTZ93) as a host which exhibited improved maximum EQE of 23.4% and 21.4% at 103 cd m−2. The same group reported three more PTZ-spiro-fluorene-PTZ type host materials (PTZ94–PTZ97) with different spiro-cores,120 as displayed in Chart 10. All of these materials exhibited similar absorption/emission properties and HOMO/LUMO energy levels. However, green PhOLED with a dopant (Ir(ppy)2(acac)) and PTZ97 as a host material device displayed the highest EQE of 18.8%, the maximum luminance of 21730 cd m−2 compare to PTZ94–PTZ96 compounds. In addition, the hole-only devices exhibited that PTZ97 showed high current density, which indicates the highest hole transport capability, which may be attributed to the highest homo-conjugation in PTZ97. Recently, Jesuraj et al., developed two armed spiro core with either PTZ or PXZ as the D–π–D host and hole transport materials in the emission layer of PhOLED, namely, PTZ98 and NPTZ9 respectively.121 The calculated hole mobility of 2.2 × 10−3 and 7.5 × 10−3 was obtained for PTZ98 and NPTZ9, respectively, which are relatively higher than that of the reference N,N′-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine NPB (0.3 × 10−3). This calculated hole mobility strongly influences their Ph-OLED device performance. As a result, the current efficiency with NPTZ9 (40 cd A−1) and PTZ98 (37 cd A−1) relatively improved values compared to those of the NPB devices (34 cd A−1) at 1000 cd m−2. In addition, the EQE has also followed a similar trend for both the HTLs, where NPTZ9 (12%) was slightly higher than that of PTZ98 (11%) and OLED lifetimes (LT50) of these two HTLs improved (more than two times) with conventional NPB. Furthermore, as the hosts, PTZ98 and NPTZ9-based Ph-OLEDs displayed current efficiencies of 37 and 28 cd A−1 at 1000 cd m−2 luminance, respectively (see Table 6). Notably, the observed current efficiency values are quite lower than those of the TPBi host-based OLEDs owing to the mismatch of HOMO/LUMO energy levels that facilitate exciton and hole leakage from the EML.

 Chart 10  Chemical structures of phenothiazine (PTZ)-based OLED emitters. 


(iii) Thermally-activated delayed fluorescence OLEDs (TADF-OLEDs). 
Both singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) outbound states should be strategically harvested to improve the performance of OLED systems. Adachi and co-workers suggested that the fluorescent singlet state population should be improved via the triplet excited state through thermally-activated reverse intersystem crossing (RISC)122 (Fig. 14). This phenomenon is also referred to as thermally-activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Recently, the third generation of organic electroluminescent materials, TADF materials, have many advantages compared to other OLED materials, such as 100% internal quantum efficiency, no heavy metal doping, and avoiding the scarcity of ordinary fluorescent and phosphorescent materials.123 PTZ is usually used as an electron donor and it possesses low ΔEST values between the triplet (T1) and singlet (S1). Therefore, highly efficient OLEDs were achieved by developing the twisted molecular D–A structures with minimum HOMO–LUMO overlapping. In 2019, Chen and his co-workers introduced three TADF emitters, where, 1,8-naphthyridine (ND) was flanked between two units of dimethylacridan (NPTZ10), phenothiazine (PTZ99), and phenoxazine (NPTZ11).124 Among these, PTZ99 exhibits fluorescence and phosphorescence at 548 nm and 567 nm, respectively. Also, the corresponding S1, T1 energy levels and ΔEST values are 2.26 eV, 2.19 eV, and 0.07 eV. Hence, the small ΔEST values of PTZ99 (gives efficient RISC process from T1 to S1) showed its potential TADF properties. As a result, multi-color (green, yellow, and orange) OLEDs based on the emitters were fabricated with mCP-host material (doped devices), which attained the maximum EQE of 14.1%, 13.4%, and 13.0% for NPTZ10, PTZ99, and NPTZ11, respectively. Remarkably, at a voltage of 6.5 V, a DMAC-ND-based non-doped device easily reached the luminance of 20000 cd m−2 and displayed a very low-efficiency roll-off of 4.5% at 1000 cd m−2 luminance and 33.6% at 10 000 cd m−2 luminance (see Table 7). However, blue TADF emitters, as well as blue OLEDs, have not been realized. Thus, authors have therefore attempted to achieve successful blue TADF emitters by further reducing the donating ability of their substituents such as carbazole. Very recently, the same group developed three more AIE-based TADF emitters using quinoline (QL) as the acceptor with the above-mentioned donors, namely, NPTZ12, PTZ100, and NPTZ13, respectively.125 The twisted conformation of these molecules minimized the HOMO/LUMO separation, resulting in a small enough ΔEST of 0.06, 0.04, and 0.10 eV, respectively, as shown in Table 7. In the same way, the fluorescence lifetimes of these molecules in their neat films were found to be about 2.15, 15.76, and 1.86 μs, respectively. As a result, the non-doped OLEDs based on the emitters NPTZ12, PTZ100, and NPTZ13 were fabricated, and the maximal EQEs were 7.7, 14.8, and 17.3% and their turn on voltages were 3.2, 2.8, and 2.6 eV, respectively. Marghad et al., synthesized a new D–A-based PTZ101 emitter having 4,6-bis-phenyl phenothiazine as the donor unit and 2-thiophene-1,3,5-triazine as the acceptor unit126 (see Chart 10). The optimized OLEDs device showed a maximum EQE of 11.5% and a luminance value of 10370 cd m−2, respectively.

Wang and his co-workers successfully developed two orange-red TADF emitters (NPTZ14 and PTZ102) via the Pd-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig amination of 7,10-dibromo-2,3-dicyanopyrazino phenanthrene (DCPP-acceptor) with the aforementioned donors phenoxazine (PXZ) or phenothiazine (PTZ), respectively.127 OLEDs based on the emitters NPTZ14 and PTZ102 were fabricated and demonstrated maximum EQEs of 17.4% and 12.3% with PEmax of 27.8 and 8.1 lm W−1, respectively. Orange and red λEL centered at 608 and 640 nm were attained with CIE coordinates of (0.56, 0.43) and (0.62, 0.36), respectively. Notably, these two TADF OLEDs showed slight efficiency roll-off with the EQEs of 12.9% and 6.1% at a luminescence of 1000 cd m−2, respectively. Later on, the above DCCP acceptor was replaced with an electron deficient 1,8-naphthalimide acceptor (NAI) and obtained NPTZ15 and PTZ103 respectively (see Chart 10). These two emitters showed distinct TADF features with small ΔEST values, that derived from the well-separated distributions of HOMO–LUMOs. As a result, the optimized TADF OLEDs based on NPTZ15 and PTZ103 emitters presented maximum EQEs of 13.0% and 11.4% with PEmax of 14.8 and 9.8 lm W−1, respectively. Moreover, as shown in Table 7, both devices emitted red EL spectra with peaks at 624 and 632 nm, and CIE of (0.610, 0.388) and (0.630, 0.368), respectively. These results suggested that an effective avenue for emerging red TADF emitters to OLEDs.128

2.6 Chemosensing application
Anions, cations, and heavy metal ions widely spread in our environments play a crucial role in our daily physiological life.129,130 These are the most life-threatening species if they exceed their biological limits in the body, which could cause serious human health and environmental damage. Hence, the fast and efficient detection of various hazardous ions in drinking water and environments is very important to provide guidance for assessing hazard and pollution management. For this, it is necessary to design and develop efficient sensing probes with good selectivity and sensitivity, which has become the desired work in sensing chemistry. However, many types of sensors and detectors (electrical, optoelectrical, or electronic) devices are available for detecting the physical presence of flame, metals, leaks, or gas and chemicals, etc. Among them, chemosensing is a popular technique, in which molecules or sensing probes are primarily planned and developed based on the principles of complementarity, co-operation, and pre-organization.131 The general strategies for the development of chemosensors (see Fig. 15) are the coupling of the signaling unit and a recognition unit either directly or via suitable spacer units. During the last few years, many phenothiazine-sensing probes have been developed for the detection of various hazardous materials due to their low-cost and ease of chemical modification.
 Fig. 15  Schematic diagram of a colorimetric/fluorescent chemosensor. 
In the PTZ molecule, more electron density is concentrated at the –S– group and it can be easily oxidized as sulfoxide and sulfone type PTZ structures. Recently, Soni and co-workers developed a photo-induced electron transfer-based PTZ-BODIPY donor–acceptor (D–A) dyad132PTZ104 and used it as a selective probe for the detection of hypochlorite (HOCl) over other ROS under simulated physiological conditions. In this PTZ104, PTZ acts as an electron donor as well as a HOCl reactive group, while BODIPY acts as an electron acceptor as well as a signaling unit. Upon the excitation of the BODIPY unit, the emission of PTZ104 was quenched (∼90%) owing to photo-induced electron transfer from PTZ to 1BODIPY*. Though, by the addition of NaOCl, the fluorescence of PTZ104 was enhanced, suggesting inhibition of the reductive PET mechanism from PTZ to BODIPY, which was rapidly bring back upon treatment with H2S, suggesting the reversibility of the probe for the continuous detection of hypochlorite (LOD of 0.72 mM). Later, the same group reported another PTZ based fluorescence chemosensor PTZ105 as shown in Chart 11. In this design, branched ethylene glycol chains on the PTZ unit and carboxylic acid functional units on the BODIPY unit enhanced its solubility in water.133 In the existence of different competing ROS, cations, and anions, the probe was examined by tracking the fluorescence and it was found that PTZ105 selectively detects OCl with an LOD of 26.7 nM. Finally, the cytotoxicity tests suggested cell viability of over 90% (up to 10 μM), indicating the use of the PTZ105 in biological applications (see Fig. 16).

Y. Zhao et al., reported a water-soluble rosamine–phenothiazine-based fluorescent probe (PTZ106) to selectively detect ClO− with rapid response (∼20 s).134 This study found that PTZ106 exhibits low limit of detection (LOD ∼ 17.8 nM) for ClO−via donor-excited photo-induced electron transfer (d-PeT) mechanism. The fluorescence imaging experiments suggests its potential to probe ClO− in biological systems.
Hg2+ is considered as one of the most dangerous heavy metal ions, which can cause extreme bone softening, stomach dysfunction, and damage the central nervous system even at the smallest level. In the environmental, medical, chemical, and biological fields, it is therefore important to control Hg2+. Recently, many fluorescent probes for Hg2+ detection have been reported.135 Among them, phenothiazine derivatives have the advantages of simplicity, high sensitivity, selectivity, low cost, and fast signal detection. For instance, a phenothiazine-based-colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescent Hg2+ sensor, namely, PTZ107, was developed by Wang et al. It showed 12.5 nM high selectivity and LOD in a broad pH range. The sensing mechanism was confirmed to be the Hg2+ activated thioacetal deprotection reaction and was based on ICT from phenothiazine to aldehyde (fluorescent turn-on and color change from pale-blue to bright-green).136 This study suggests that PTZ107 can be used for the highly selective detection and imaging of Hg2+ in living cells, and on paper or TLC-based “naked-eye” colorimetric assays (see Fig. 17).
 Fig. 17  (Top left arrow) PTZ107 (PPM) probe for Hg2+ detection and its mechanism PTZ107 to 2; (top right arrow) living cells; (down arrow) paper- or TLC-based naked-eye colorimetric assay with various concentrations of PTZ107. This figure was adapted from ref. 136. 
Another PTZ-based Hg detecting probe PTZ108 was reported by Sun et al., (see Chart 11) and it shows high selectivity, sensitivity, and fast naked eye detection from colorless to yellow on adding Hg2+. In this mechanism, Hg2+ promoted the desulfurization of thioacetal present on PTZ and formed corresponding the aldehyde, resulting in a structure having significant ICT from PTZ to aldehyde.137 In addition, cell cytotoxicity of PTZ108 was successfully applied to detect and image Hg2+ in real water samples as well as living cells. The PTZ108 chemosensor overcomes the limitations of the sensors tested so far and has been used to image Hg2+ in environmental samples and biological systems, rather than the identification of a single environment. Interestingly, PTZ108 was used in real water samples and living cells to detect the presence of Hg2+. So far, various PTZ probes have been developed due to their inexpensive and facile structural modification. Because of the strong donating ability of phenothiazine, a space for new PTZ-based probes can be created for the naked-eye detection and imaging of various toxic analytes by the ICT mechanism.
2.7 Non-linear optics (NLO)
Non-linear optics (NLO) is one of the sub-disciplines of contemporary optics and these studies involve a variety of non-linear effects that occur in light–matter interactions. NLO is extensively used in various applications and fields such as laser technology, optical computing, optical switching, image processing, information processing, and data storage.138 During the past few years, organic materials have displayed attractive NLO properties and have been widely studied since their several advantages due to their low cost, low toxicity, ease of solution processability, flexibility in their structural modification, and flexibility for device fabrication.139 Moreover, the recent advances in the development of organic π-conjugated systems with excellent NLO properties arise due to the ease of chemical synthesis, fine-tuning of the NLO susceptibilities/coefficients flexibility, and solution processability. Even then, we still need to overcome some obstacles, such as energy efficiency, optical loss, bandwidth, drive voltage, and signal distortion associated with active photonic devices. To date, the study of NLO organic π-conjugated chromophores (phenothiazine, carbazole, triphenylamines, corroles, porphyrins, phthalocyanines, organic–metal hybrid systems, MOFs, etc.) has made incredible development for their potential applications in photonic devices.140 However, PTZ-based π-conjugated organic compounds have been of great interest since the 1990s because of their low ionization potentials and ease of modulating their optical, NLO susceptibilities/coefficients, and electronic and chemical properties by tuning their molecular structure.141
Chandrasekharan and his group have extensively worked on phenothiazine–metal nanocomposites/nanoparticles. In 2017, they synthesized PTZ–Au nanocomposite (NC) and studied their NLO properties using the single-beam Z-scan technique.142 PTZ made a substantial enrichment (∼67 times) in non-linear optical absorption (NLA) in the PTZ–Au composite when compared to the constituent units (Au-NPs) and (PTZ). The improvement was credited to both the local field effect and electron/energy transfer. From the Z-scan analysis (see Fig. 18(a) and (b)), it was observed that the cause for NLA and optical limitation (OL) of PTZ was TPA, while that of the NC was excited state absorption (ESA) along with TPA. In the development of Au-NPs, PTZ plays a significant role as a reducing and stabilizing agent. Energy transfer through the overlap of the PTZ emission spectra and Au NP absorption spectra plus the interaction of Au NPs between PTZ and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) resulted in a good delocalization of the charge between them and hence the system's dipole moment was greatly enhanced, as demonstrated in Fig. 18(b) and (c). This results in a substantial increase in the NLO properties of 8.7 × 10−12 esu for PTZAu NPs relative to that of pure Au-NPs (7.1 × 10−12 esu) and PTZ (3.1 × 10−12 esu), respectively, and boost in the optical limiting (2.59 J cm−2) action of the PTZ–Au NPs at an input intensity of 0.82 GW cm−2 compared to that of pure Au NPs and PTZ. In continuation, another PTZ–Ag hybrid system was prepared via a pulsed laser ablation technique (photoionization of PTZ and the ablation of the Ag).143 The substantial improvement in the NLO properties of 14.2 × 10−12 esu for PTZ–Ag relative to pure Ag (4.7 × 10−12 esu) and PTZ (3.1 × 10−12 esu), respectively, and boost in the optical limiting (3.43 J cm−2) action of PTZ–Ag at an input intensity of 0.83 GW cm−2 related to pure Au NPs and PTZ, respectively, were observed. The observed enhancement (even related to PTZ–Au–NC) was explained by the strong charge transfer between PTZ and Ag NPs and the local field effect induced due to the SPR of Ag NPs. Recently, Zhu et al., developed two S,N-co-doped carbon quantum dots (CQDs) from PTZ and NLO/optical power limiting (OPL) properties studied using the Z-scan technique at 532 nm, taking C60 as the standard ref. 144. Both D1 and D2 showed similar NLO properties to C60, while D-2 showed better OPL activity than D-1 because of the larger size of the CQDs, which induces a stronger response to non-linear scattering (NLS). Wang et al., reported four ferrocene-based D–π–A organic chromophores (NPTZ16 to NPTZ-18 and PTZ109) using various donors and spacers, as displayed in Chart 12. All of them, including the phenothiazine-appended dye (PTZ109), exhibits better optical, electrochemical, and energy levels. The NLO properties are directly related to the ICT character of the molecules. Notably, NPTZ16 and NPTZ17 displayed higher two-photon absorption cross-section (σ) than NPTZ18 and PTZ109. These results indicate that all the dyes have identical donor and acceptor parts; obviously, the bridge/spacer is a crucial factor for determining the third-order non-linear properties.145

The π-conjugated macrocyclic derivatives such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines displayed excellent NLO properties related to other π-conjugated systems.146,147 Recently, our group synthesized three porphyrin derivatives without metal (PTZ46) and with Zn(II) (PTZ47)- and Cu(II) (PTZ48)-based phenothiazine tethered porphyrin (D–π–D) systems (see Chart 12) and evaluated the NLO properties with the Z-scan technique and degenerate four-wave mixing (DFWM) experiment at 800 nm.148 Studies reveal that the NLO coefficient of the metallated derivatives have shown stronger 2PA cross-section in the range of 820–5400 GM recorded in dimethylformamide than that of PTZ46 due to their considerable population in the excited-state, confirmed from transient absorption studies. However, the attained NLO coefficients from the DFWM and Z-scan studies matched in the orders of magnitude, suggesting the potential for photonic and optical switching applications.
2.8 Self-assembly
Self-assembly is an essential process in nature and is important in the fields of material science, biology, and chemistry.149 Molecular self-assembly can be defined as the spontaneous organization of molecular building blocks into ordered structures due to non-covalent interactions.150 Self-assembly in the aspect of materials indicates that constituents are designed to create a functional ordered structure with minimal support from humans or machines. This process is observed on any scale ranging from nano- and micrometer scale to macroscopic dimensions.151 These simple structures are formed using hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking, metal–ligand interactions, electrostatic forces, strong dipole–dipole association, hydrophobic forces, and steric repulsions. As a result, a plethora of supramolecular assemblies such as gels and liquid crystals, several soft nanoribbons, nanotubes, nanorods, and nanowires of low dimensionality of 1D, 2D, 3D have been obtained.152 These nanostructures can enhance the charge transfer efficiency when incorporated into organic electronic devices and find a wide range of organo-optoelectronic applications.
Prasad and his group studied the self-assembly of phenothiazine-based oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (PTZ110–115) building blocks by changing various substitutions153 (see Chart 13). All these compounds exhibit significant solvatochromism, in particular, non-boron molecules show higher PL shift than those comprising the boron unit owing to the presence of sterically-crowded substituents (BMes2). Moreover, through self-assembly via hydrophobic interactions of the long hexadecyl chains and π-interactions of their aromatic counterparts, PTZ113 underwent gelation and showed hierarchically ordered 1D fibers in a range of organic solvent mixtures. In another study, they introduced two dendron-based phase selective gelators (DPSGs) PTZ116 and PTZ117, which are derived from acylhydrazone linkage with alkyl PTZ, and can be used as PSGs for fuel oils.154 Compounds PTZ116 and PTZ117 form yellow-colored gels in non-polar and aromatic solvents including solvent mixtures, which are identified by their unique characteristics in the FTIR, UV, and PL studies when compared to normal solutions. The morphology of the self-assembled systems is identified as a helical fibrous structure in hexane and fractal type structure in solvent mixtures (see Fig. 19). The findings indicate that the solvent plays a crucial role in determining the self-assembly morphology by monitoring the solute–solute and solute–solvent interactions. It was observed that the gelation strength increased with an increase in the number of π-aromatic rings. Hence, gelator PTZ117 was found to be more efficient than gelator PTZ116.

Singh et al., developed a PTZ-appended terpyridine system (MTPY) and its Zn(II) complexes (PTZ118 and PTZ119).155 Solvent dependent self-assembly investigations were carried out using solvent hydrophilicity (THF/water) and hydrophobicity (THF/hexane). Increasing the hydrophilicity causes concentration-induced emission (CIE) in MTPY; however, PTZ118 and PTZ119 showed typical aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ). In contrast, increasing the hydrophobicity showed a substantial effect on MTPY and led to typical aggregation and emission enhancement for both the complexes. The aggregates suspension of MTPY, PTZ118, and PTZ119 produced nanoball aggregates (uniform size), densely packed fibers, and well-defined size and shaped spherical aggregates were observed in the hydrophilic solvent (THF/water) system, whereas no such aggregates, nanorod-like structures (uniform thickness), and irregular size and shaped flakes in the hydrophobic solvent (THF/hexane) system were observed.
A strategy for the selective coordination-driven self-assembly of an emissive phenothiazine (1) metallosupramolecule has been demonstrated by Zhou et al., based on the application of suitable stoichiometries and directionalities of various organometallic Pt(II) acceptors.156 The authors described (see Fig. 20) the self-assembly of 1 with a 60° diplatinum complex 2 and a monoplatinum complex 3 in an apt ratio, which leads to the formation of supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) 4 and 5 assembled via [2+4] and [1+4] addition, respectively. For the comparison of the photophysical properties and self-assembly studies, methylpyridinium salt 6 was prepared and investigated. Studies have shown that the formation of SCCs results in a substantial increase in the quantum yield in the solution 4-fold, primarily owing to the further twisting of the luminophore, which increases the radiative rate constant related to those in free luminophore 1 or its non-self-assembled analogue 6. The variations in the quantum yields can be described by chromophore twisting upon platinum coordination or pyridyl group methylation, leading to ISC to a triplet state.

Recently, Khadieva et al., developed ester and carboxylic groups containing 3,7-bis(arylamino)phenothiazin-5-ium derivatives 3 and PTZ120, respectively.157 The 1:1 association of PTZ120 with 7-phenylamino-3-phenyliminophenothiazine (PTZ121) in water (PTZ122) was investigated along with the individuals. Compounds PTZ120 and PTZ121 and their associates were nanoprecipitated from methanol solutions into water under ultrasonication. The supramolecular self-assembly of these phenothiazine motifs gives spherical nanoparticles (PTZ120), filament structures (PTZ121), and faceted (∼cubic shape) nanoparticles PTZ122 with an average size of 140, 260, and 237 nm, respectively. This study reveals that the dispersions of non-toxic substances characterized by extreme absorption in the near IR range are used in bio and optoelectronic applications.
2.9 Miscellaneous
The distinct characteristics of phenothiazine make them usable in a number of fields, such as (i) battery cathodes,158 (ii) pharmaceutical drugs,159 (iii) photodynamic and photo-thermal therapy,160 (iv) biofuel cells,161 (v) biosensors,162,163 and (vi) photo & electrocatalysis.164–166
3. Conclusion and perspective
In the past few years, the study of PTZ-based materials has perceived huge attention apart from their usefulness as a donor for a variety of optoelectronic applications. The multiple positions to modify their chemical structure provide synthetically tunable or adaptable electronic, physico-chemical, optical, thermal properties, and their supramolecular self-assembly via various non-covalent interactions. It is not surprising, given their flexibility and uses, that several reviews have been written from various angles. In this review, we provided a broad literature survey of PTZ derivatives for various applications (including brief working mechanism) such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), perovskite solar cells (PSCs), organic solar cells (OSCs), OLEDs, OFETs, chemosensing, NLOs, and supramolecular self-assembly. In particular, the PTZ molecules presented in this review demonstrate how small modifications in the chemical structure such as different electron donors or acceptors, length of the π-conjugated system or spacers, polar/non-polar chains, and other functional groups on PTZ can lead to substantial changes in the opto-electronic properties of the PTZ materials, as a result, enhancing the electronic device performance.
The development of phenothiazine functional materials with adjustable optoelectronic characteristics can be aided by careful molecular engineering of the PTZ unit in terms of the shape, molecular structure, and inexpensive synthetic protocols with desirable yields. Several investigations have shown that even minor structural changes to the PTZ unit or the conjugate backbone may cause significant changes in the molecular characteristics and influence the device performance.
The molecular shape of PTZ can be altered by oxidizing sulphur and then its geminate dithionation using Lawesson's reagent or elemental sulphur, resulting in a planar structure that further reduces the HOMO–LUMO gap and enhances the thermal and photostability.
Noteworthily, D–π–A, D–π–D, A–π–D–π–D–π–π–A, D–A–D, D–A–π–A–D, etc., based molecular structure or configurations are not limited to particular applications; however, they were restricted to very few molecules until now. Interestingly, the variation of acceptors, donors, π-bridges, alkyl or glycol chains, and amide groups in the PTZ derivatives can induce remarkable changes in the photophysical, electrochemical, and charge transport properties. Such modifications provide PTZ-based functional materials desirable features such as solubility, thin-film crystallinity, morphology, broader absorption/emission wavelengths, low band gap, and balanced charge transport.
Though the commercial price of PTZ is very low, the desired PTZ functional materials’ cost is too high since their synthetic techniques employ scarcely available Pd-metal catalyst and C–C/C–N based coupling processes. These strategies fail to meet sustainability standards and industrial-scale up. These challenges are being tackled by different efficient synthetic strategies such as metal-free or low-cost metal-based C–H activation, heterogeneous catalysis, photochemical, and electrochemical approaches.
Thus, the review on PTZ materials and their wide variety of applications promote the design of novel phenothiazines derivatives and study in detail from the aspects of electronic- and biological applications.
