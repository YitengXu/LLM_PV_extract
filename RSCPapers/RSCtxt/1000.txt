    , Accepted 1st July 2019First published on 8th July 2019AbstractWe report here the effect of interlayer spacing in 2-dimensional (2D) perovskites of [C6H5(CH2)nNH3]2PbI4 (anilinium (An) for n = 0, benzylammonium (BzA) for n = 1 and phenylethylammonium (PEA) for n = 2) on resistive switching properties. X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals that the interlayer spacing of layered PbI2 is increased from 6.98 Å to 13.29 Å for (An)2PbI4, 14.20 Å for (BzA)2PbI4 and 15.92 Å for (PEA)2PbI4, which leads to a monolayer of organic cations with stacked benzene rings between inorganic PbI42− layers. All the samples in the device structure of Ag/PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate)/perovskite/Pt show bipolar switching behavior, where the SET voltage is near +0.2 V and the RESET voltage is less than −0.5 V. The ratio of LRS (low resistance state) to HRS (high resistance state), also called the ON/OFF ratio, is increased from 106 to 108 as interlayer spacing is increased due to the gradual increase in resistance in the HRS. Endurance is slightly improved from 1.3 × 102 for An to 2.2 × 102 for PEA, whereas substantial improvement in retention is observed from 2 × 103 to 5.5 × 103. This indicates that the enhanced 2D structure is beneficial to the kinetics of forming and rupturing the conducting filaments. The ohmic-like conduction mechanism in the LRS and the hopping mechanism in the HRS are observed for all three samples. This work finds that the resistive switching properties and conduction mechanism in the HRS depend on interlayer spacing in 2D perovskites.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite (OHP) materials have attracted great attention since the first report on all-solid-state perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 9.7% and 500 h-stability.1 The unprecedentedly high efficiency of 23.7% reported in December in 20182 is due to the outstanding opto-electronic properties of OHP such as the high absorption coefficient, micro-meter scale long charge diffusion length and low exciton binding energies.3–6 Because of its superb optical and electronic properties, beyond the photovoltaic application of OHP, OHP extends its application to light-emitting diodes,7–10 X-ray imaging11–13 and resistive switching memory.14–18
Resistive random access memory (ReRAM) is regarded as one of the next-generation memory devices because of low operating voltage and scalability with a simple metal–insulator–metal (MIM) structure. Recently, perovskite resistive memory (PRM) was reported to show millivolt-scale low operating voltage,15 a 7–8 orders of magnitude on/off ratio17,19 and flexibility.16,20 Thus PRM can replace metal oxide or chalcogenide based resistive memory devices.21 The most studied OHPs for PRM are three-dimensional perovskite materials such as MAPbI3,15 MAPbI3−xClx,14,22 FAPbI3,23 and CsPbI3.17 Lower dimensional OHPs were recently applied to PRM, including zero-dimensional (OD),19 one-dimensional (1D),23 and two-dimensional (2D)24 structures, and demonstrated preferred pathways for conducting filaments. In 2D layered structures with the chemical formula of A2BX4, BX42− inorganic sheets are separated by long chains or large size organic cations in the A-site,25 which is also proved to be more stable than 3D perovskites.26 In our previous work, we found from the effect of dimensionality on resistive switching properties that the on/off ratio was significantly increased by about 5 orders of magnitude upon reducing dimensionality from 3D to 2D in BA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 (BA = butylammonium and MA = methylammonium).24 A higher on/off ratio was found to correlate with a higher Schottky barrier and thermal activation energy for 2D BA2PbI4. Thus, we are further motivated to explore the effect of organic cations in the 2D structure on resistive switching properties.
We report here the dependence of resistive switching on the alkyl chain length of alkyl benzene in layered perovskites of [C6H5(CH2)nNH3]2PbI4 (n = 0, 1 and 2). The aim of this research is to understand the anisotropic properties of resistive switching in 2D OHP. Interlayer spacing is increased as the chain length is increased as determined by X-ray diffraction. It is observed that the on/off ratio is increased with interlayer spacing, which is clearly indicative of the dependence of resistive switching properties on interlayer spacing in 2D perovskites.
Results and discussion
For measuring current–voltage curves, the [C6H5(CH2)nNH3]2PbI4 (n = 0, 1 and 2) thin films are sandwiched by a Pt-coated Si wafer and an Ag top electrode to form a metal–insulator–metal (MIM) structure (Fig. 1(a)). The poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layer is inserted in between the Ag electrode and the perovskite layer in order to protect the chemical reaction of iodide in perovskites with the Ag electrode under ambient conditions.17 To find the optimal thickness of the PMMA layer, the solution concentration is varied from 2.5 mg ml−1 to 10 mg ml−1 (PMMA is dissolved in chlorobenzene), from which the 5 mg ml−1 solution is found to be appropriate in terms of coverage and reliable switching performance. Cylindrical shape Ag top electrodes with a radius of 50 μm and a height of 135 nm are deposited on the PMMA layer. Organic cation structures in [C6H5(CH2)nNH3]2PbI4 (n = 0, 1 and 2) are depicted in Fig. 1(b), where the alkyl chain lengths between benzene and ammonium are 0 for anilinium (An), 1 for benzylammonium (BzA) and 2 for phenylethylammonium (PEA).

Cross-sectional and top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images are shown in Fig. 2(a–c). The film thicknesses of the [C6H5(CH2)nNH3]2PbI4 perovskite deposited on the Pt electrode are determined to be ca. 365, 275 and 304 nm for n = 0, 1 and 2, respectively. No voids are observed between the perovskite film and the Pt electrode, which indicates that the perovskite film is well adhered on the Pt electrode. Moreover, the perovskite film is densely packed for all the compositions. However, the surface morphology of the deposited perovskite film is different as observed from the top-view SEM images in Fig. 2(d–f). The grain size is decreased as the alkyl chain length is increased from n = 0 to n = 2. In addition, a more compact nature is observed for a longer alkyl chain. The average grain sizes of (An)2PbI4, (BzA)2PbI4, and (PEA)2PbI4 films are determined to be 78.85 nm, 51.82 nm, and 47.92 nm, respectively, by a line intercept method as shown in Fig. S1.† Morphological changes depending on the alkyl chain length in [C6H5(CH2)nNH3]2PbI4 indicate that the self-organization of 2D perovskites is influenced by interlayer organic cations. We further confirm the layered structure from X-ray diffraction measurements. Fig. 2(g–i) clearly show the layered structure of [C6H5(CH2)nNH3]2PbI4 because of the well-developed (002l) peaks (l = 1–5 for n = 0 and 1 and l = 1–6 for n = 2), which is indicative of preferential growth along the (110) direction.27 Thus the exposed surface in Fig. 2(d–f) presumably corresponds to (110) planes. In addition, the X-ray crystallite size is similar for (An)2PbI4 and (BzA)2PbI4; however, (PEA)2PbI4 shows a much larger crystallite size because of the narrower peak width as observed in the insets of Fig. 2(g–i). We calculated the crystallite size using the Scherrer equation based on the (004) peak, where a dimensionless shape factor is assumed to be 1. The X-ray crystallite size is estimated to be about 17.16 nm for (An)2PbI4, 13.60 nm for (BzA)2PbI4 and 90.86 nm for (PEA)2PbI4. The change in the X-ray crystallite size along with the alkyl chain length is not well matched with the tendency of the average grain size observed in top-view SEM images, which indicates that small nano-sized crystals are composed of a grain for (An)2PbI4 and (BzA)2PbI4.
 Fig. 2  (a–c) Cross-sectional and (d–f) top-view SEM images and (g–i) XRD patterns of 2D perovskite films deposited on the Pt-coated Si substrate. The insets show (004) reflection peaks. 
XRD data are summarized in Table 1. The interlayer spacing (d-spacing) of inorganic (PbI42−) sheets increases from 13.29 Å for anilinium (n = 0) to 14.20 Å for benzylammonium (n = 1) and 15.92 Å for phenylethylammonium (n = 2). From the linear fit results, it is found that the interlayer spacing is increased by about 1 Å per –CH2–, which implies that carbon pi bonding orbitals in the benzene ring are not perpendicular but almost parallel to the c-axis because of the bond length of 1.1 Å for C–H and 1.54 Å for C–C.28 As compared to the interlayer spacing of about 6.98 Å for PbI2 observed at around 2θ = 12.7°,29 the increase of interlayer spacing (Δd) from 6.98 Å to 13.29 Å, corresponding to an increment of 6.31 Å, is due to the presence of anilinium ions between inorganic slabs. When considering the dimensions of anilinium ions (2.78 Å for benzene, 1.465 Å for C–N in aniline salt and 1.2 Å for the van der Waals radius of hydrogen), the monolayer of anilinium ions with sandwiched pi stacking is probably stabilized in between inorganic PbI42− slabs as shown in Fig. 3. For benzylammonium and phenylethylammonium cases, monolayer arrangement is similarly expected.

Fig. 4 shows current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of Ag/PMMA/A2PbI4/Pt (A = An, BzA and PEA) devices, where the alternation of resistance occurs. The change of resistance from the high resistance state (HRS) to the low resistance state (LRS) is called the SET process in which the conducting filament is formed, and the opposite process is named the RESET process due to rupturing of the filament, leading to bipolar switching behavior.30,31 The LRS and HRS are also identical to the ON and OFF states, respectively. For the (An)2PbI4/Pt case in Fig. 4(a), a conducting filament is formed at a SET voltage of ∼0.3 V, which can be gradually ruptured at a RESET voltage of about −0.25 V, without an electroforming step,24,32–35 where an ON/OFF ratio of around 106–107 is observed. A slightly higher ON/OFF ratio more than 107 is observed for (BzA)2PbI4 with a lower SET voltage of about 0.2 V and also a gradual RESET process with an average Rreset of −0.29 V (Fig. 4(b)). For the (PEA)2PbI4/Pt case in Fig. 4(c), the SET voltage is 0.2 V and the RESET process occurs at an applied voltage of −1.0 V, along with a higher ON/OFF ratio of ca. 108. Repeated switching cycles seem to be better from 4 cycles to 11 cycles as the interlayer spacing increases. SET and RESET voltages are read in each I–V curve, which are plotted in Fig. S2(a and b).† We also check the reproducibility of switching behavior depending on the chain length of organic cations in 2D perovskites. Fig. 4(d–f) demonstrate the reliability of resistive switching behaviors, in terms of SET and RESET voltages, HRS and LRS and ON/OFF ratio, in the different devices. It is noted that at the same concentration of 0.5 M solution and spin-coating conditions for (An)2PbI4, (BzA)2PbI4 and (PEA)2PbI4, a slightly thinner layer is formed for the (BzA)2PbI4 film (see Fig. 2(b)). Since switching behavior may be affected by the thickness, a thicker film of about 350 nm is also prepared by decreasing the spin speed from 4000 rpm to 2000 rpm for (BzA)2PbI4. However, no distinct difference in switching behavior in terms of SET and RESET voltages and ON/OFF ratio is found between 275 nm- and 350 nm-thick (BzA)2PbI4 films (Fig. S3†). In addition, it was reported that the grain size can affect the switching properties,36,37 where current in the HRS decreased as the grain size was increased from 60 nm to 600 nm or from 180 nm to 1000 nm. However, as can be seen in Fig. S1,† the difference in the grain size among 2D perovskite materials studied in this work is too small to affect the switching properties. This is also proved by conducting an experiment, where little effect of the grain size on the ON/OFF ratio is observed from changing the grain size by modifying the annealing time and annealing temperature and adding anti-solvents dropwise according to ref. 38 and 39.

Fig. 5 shows that the layered perovskites have multi-level storage capability, which is measured by changing the compliance current in the SET process. Multi-level characteristics are correlated with the density of data stored in the device.15,40,41 Three levels of the LRS in each sample are shown in Fig. 5(a–c), where (An)2PbI4 and (BzA)2PbI4 are measured by regulating the compliance current from 10−5 A to 10−3 A in the SET process, while the compliance current of the LRS in the (PEA)2PbI4 sample can be regulated from 10−6 A to 10−3 A in the SET process. However, if the compliance current is changed, the graph shape of the RESET process is changed slightly. It means that too low compliance current makes the cell show unstable switching behavior.

To check the reproducibility of the switching data, we determine the HRS and LRS with 30 different cells at 0.02 V. As can be seen in Fig. 6(a–c), except for the perturbation in the HRS for (BzA)2PbI4, (An)2PbI4 and (PEA)2PbI4 display consistent a HRS and LRS. The average resistance of the HRS and LRS is 1.46 × 109 Ω and ∼159 Ω, respectively, and the average ON/OFF ratio is 3.12 × 107 Ω for (An)2PbI4 cells. The average of the ON/OFF ratio is 2.41 × 108 Ω for (BzA)2PbI4 and 2.47 × 108 Ω for (PEA)2PbI4. The ON/OFF ratio is obviously higher as the 2D nature is enhanced due to the increased resistance of the HRS.
 Fig. 6  HRS and LRS of 30 different cells within one mother device for (a) (An)2PbI4, (b) (BzA)2PbI4 and (c) (PEA)2PbI4, read at +0.02 V. 
Switching cyclability is measured to compare the endurance of resistive memory devices depending on interlayer spacing (Fig. 7(a–c)). The MIM cell with (An)2PbI4 or (BzA)2PbI4 is operated with applied voltages of +0.5 V in the SET process and −1.0 V in the RESET process during the cycle test. For the cell with (PEA)2PbI4, a SET voltage of +1.0 V and a RESET voltage of −1.0 V are applied. The reading voltage of all states is +0.02 V. As the interlayer spacing increases with the chain length of the A-site cation ((An)2PbI4 → (BzA)2PbI4 → (PEA)2PbI4), the number of cycles increases, and the ON/OFF ratio increases as well. The LRS is not affected but the HRS is significantly influenced by interlayer spacing. This indicates that the ON/OFF ratio can be adjusted by interlayer spacing. Enhanced endurance observed from (PEA)2PbI4 with larger interlayer spacing also implies that enhanced 2D structure is beneficial for forming and rupturing conductive filaments. Since non-volatile memory properties are important in resistive switching memory devices, the retention time is measured for both the HRS and the LRS. Fig. 7(d–f) show the retention time of the HRS and LRS measured at a reading voltage of +0.02 V with an interval of 10 s for the LRS and 20 s for the HRS. (An)2PbI4 is relatively hard to withstand in the ON state (LRS) as compared to the OFF state (HRS), while (BzA)2PbI4 and (PEA)2PbI4 exhibit a longer retention time for both states. Endurance and retention are simultaneously improved as interlayer spacing increases, which indicates that enhanced 2-dimensionality is beneficial to resistive switching properties.
 Fig. 7  HRS and LRS depending on (a–c) number of cycles and (d–f) retention time for (An)2PbI4, (BzA)2PbI4 and (PEA)2PbI4. For the endurance test, the SET voltage was +0.5 V for (An)2PbI4 and (BzA)2PbI4 and +1.0 V for (PEA)2PbI4 and the RESET voltage was −1.0 V. 
Since the ON/OFF ratio is increased with interlayer spacing due to the larger HRS, we also measure the resistance of AnI, BzAI and PEAI only by coating the precursor solution of three organic halides on the glass substrate. Fig. 8 shows resistance data for (C6H5)(CH2)nNH3I obtained by applying a bias voltage of +0.5 V and reading at +0.02 V (filled triangles), which is compared with the HRS and LRS for [(C6H5)(CH2)nNH3]2PbI4. Resistance increases with the increasing alkyl chain length in (C6H5)(CH2)nNH3I. Resistance values and tendency are close to those of the HRS. Little dependence of the LRS but a gradual increase in the HRS with the alkyl chain length suggests that OFF-state resistance (HRS) is presumably related to the intrinsic properties of the material. Thus the increase in the HRS with the alkyl chain length is due to the enhanced insulating properties of the interlayer organic materials associated with the increase in the non-polar alkyl chain.

PRM has been reported as various driving mechanisms depending on the insulating layer and device structure, where electrochemical metallization of both Ag and iodide vacancies is related to the formation of the filament.42–45 In our system, electrochemical metallization (ECM) by the Ag redox reaction is assumed to be dominant. To verify the ECM mechanism, the Ag electrode is replaced with the Au one. Fig. S4(a–c)† show that no resistive switching occurs even at a high voltage of 3 V for the SET process, which indicates that the conducting filament is likely to be dominantly formed by the migration of Ag cations.17,24 To analyze further the switching mechanisms of the PRM devices, we try to fit the natural logarithmic I–V characteristics of three layered-perovskites, which is displayed in Fig. 9(a–c). The ln(I) vs. ln(V) plot for the SET process of the (An)2PI4 based device obtained by applying a SET voltage of +0.5 V shows that the slope of the LRS is determined to be 0.98. The slope of the LRS is 0.96 and 0.99 for (BzA)2PbI4 and (PEA)2PbI4, respectively. The fitted slopes being close to 1 for all three samples implies that the main conduction mechanism of the LRS is related to ohmic-like conduction for the LRS in the SET process, which means that the conducting filament is well formed in SET.30,46 On the other hand, the current seems to be almost unchanged with voltage in HRS as shown in Fig. 9(a–c), so we replot ln(I) versus V in Fig. 9(d–f). The data are fit linearly, which is indicative of the hopping mechanism.47,48 In the hopping mechanism, since current (I) can be expressed as , in which A is the cell area, q is the electronic charge, a is the hopping distance, n is the electron concentration in the conduction band, ν is the frequency of thermal vibration of electrons in trap states, Ea is the activation energy associated with the energy level from the trap states to the bottom of the conduction band, E is the applied electric field, k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature,47 ln(I) should be linearly proportional to electric field E, represented by voltage(V). We replot ln(I) with respect to V in Fig. 9(d–f) to investigate the underlying hopping mechanism in the HRS. Current is linearly proportional to voltage for (An)2PbI4, (BzA)2PbI4, and (PEA)2PbI4, which indicates that the layered perovskite with An, BzA, and PEA can be explained by the hopping mechanism for current conduction in the HRS.

Stability is finally investigated at elevated temperature and in a humidity environment. Fig. S5(a–c)† show I–V data measured at 85 °C, where bipolar resistive switching can be performed for all three materials. The devices are stored for 3 days under ambient conditions with a relative humidity of about 50% at 25 °C in air. Fig. S6(a–c)† show that the (An)2PbI4/Pt device is unable to maintain its resistive switching behavior after 3 days, whereas (BzA)2PbI4 and (PEA)2PbI4 devices demonstrate the bipolar switching characteristics. This indicates that 2D perovskites with a large d-spacing are promising materials for stable non-volatile memory.
Conclusions
We studied the effect of interlayer spacing in 2D perovskites of [C6H5(CH2)nNH3]2PbI4 (n = 0, 1 and 2) on resistive switching properties. XRD revealed that interlayer spacing was increased as n was increased and the monolayer of alkyl benzene ammonium ions was stabilized between 2D inorganic PbI42− layers. Similar resistance in the LRS was observed regardless of interlayer spacing but resistance in the HRS was increased with interlayer spacing, leading to an improved ON/OFF ratio. Endurance and retention were improved as interlayer spacing was increased, that is, 2-dimensionality was enhanced, proving that forming and rupturing the conducting filaments were dominant in 2D inorganic sheets. Resistances in the HRS for the 2D perovskites were found to be related to the interlayer organic cations, where separation of pi-electrons in benzene with ammonium cations by the alkyl chain increased resistance. This work provides insight into the effect of interlayer spacing in 2D perovskites on the ON/OFF ratio, endurance and retention of resistive switching memory devices.
Experimental
Synthesis of materials
C6H5NH3I (anilinium iodide, AnI) was synthesized by the reaction between 10 ml of C6H5NH2 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.5%) and 15 ml of HI (TCI, 57 wt% in H2O) in a 1:1 molar ratio. The solution was stirred with a magnetic bar in a round-bottom flask in an ice bath for 2 h. The yellowish-white precipitate was collected by evaporation using a rotary evaporator at 60 °C, which was followed by washing with diethyl ether five times and then recrystallization using ethanol and diethyl ether to obtain a white powder. The white powder was dried for 24 h in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. C6H5CH2NH3I (benzylammonium iodide, BzAI) was synthesized by the reaction between 10 ml of C6H5CH2NH2 (Sigma Aldrich, 99%) and 12 ml of HI (TCI, 57 wt% in H2O) in a 1:1 molar ratio. The reaction procedure was the same as that for AnI. C6H5(CH2)2NH3I (phenethylammonium iodide, PEAI) was synthesized by the reaction between 10 ml of C6H5(CH2)2NH2 (Sigma Aldrich, 99%) and 11 ml of HI (TCI, 57 wt% in H2O) in a 1:1 molar ratio via the same procedure as that for AnI and BzAI.
Fabrication of resistive switching memory devices
The 100 nm-thick Pt coated silicon wafer was cleaned by ultrasonication successively in detergent, ethanol, acetone and ethanol, and was further cleaned by UV-ozone for 20 min before deposition of the perovskite film. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbI2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.999%) and the synthesized organic iodide (AnI, BzAI or PEAI) in 0.2 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to obtain 0.5 M solution. The precursor solution was filtered by a syringe filter PTFE-H with a pore size of 0.45 μm, which was spin-coated on the cleaned Pt-coated Si wafer at 4000 rpm for 60 s (acceleration = 1200 rpm s−1). To make a uniform film, 0.3 ml of anhydrous toluene was added dropwise onto the substrate while spinning (12 s after spinning). The as-spun film was annealed at 75 °C for 30 min on a hot plate, on which the solution of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, Alfa Aesar) was deposited at a spin-coating speed of 4000 rpm for 20 s. Then, the device was annealed at 50 °C for 5 min. Finally, 135 nm-thick-Ag was deposited on the top of the PMMA layer by thermal evaporation maintaining a deposition rate of 0.2–0.3 Å s−1.
Characterization
Cross-sectional and top-view images were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM7500F, JEOL). X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were obtained by using an X-ray diffractometer (D2 phaser, Bruker) with Cu Kα radiation (wavelength = 1.54056 Å) at a step scan of 0.01°. All electrical properties were characterized using a vacuum probe station equipped with a Keithley 4200 under ca. 10−2 torr.
