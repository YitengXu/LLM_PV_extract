    , Accepted 2nd September 2020First published on 2nd September 2020AbstractBioelectrochemical power-to-gas presents a promising technology for long-term storage of excess renewable energy in the form of methane. The transition of the technology from laboratory to applied scale is currently challenged by low volumetric production rates, energy losses at the cathode, as well as the unknown physiology of the microbes in an electrochemical reactor. Here, we introduce a stable electromethanogenesis system based on efficient in situ hydrogen production by non-precious-metal catalysts and effective hydrogen uptake by the methanogenic microorganisms. Using NiMo-cathodes and pure cultures of hydrogenotrophic Methanococcus maripaludis, our system achieved an unprecedented volumetric methane production rate from CO2 of 1.4 L methane per L per day. The system performed stably for over 4 weeks with columbic efficiencies steadily above 90%. A physiological analysis of cells in the electromethanogenic reactor revealed robustly-growing cells with nearly identical protein expression patterns to gas-fed controls. Local pH fluctuations at the surface of cathode and cation exchange membrane resulted in a small but noticeable fraction of cell lysis. Our data collectively indicate that physiologically uncompromised cells of a pure methanogenic culture can perform methanogenesis robustly at high specific rate in a biocompatible electromethanogenic reactor using inexpensive, earth-abundant cathode materials.
Introduction
The main sources of renewable electrical energy such as solar and wind are inherently intermittent, and a high fraction of available renewable energy is lost unless stored by new technology platforms. Especially, storage technologies on the timescale of days to weeks or even seasons are missing.1 One promising technology is “power-to-gas” where electricity is stored in the form of an energy-rich gas such as hydrogen or methane.2 Power-to-methane conversion provides an attractive storage platform leveraged by the existing, well-developed natural gas infrastructure worldwide. The most developed, traditional route for power-to-gas is a two-step process of water electrolysis and subsequent thermochemical methanation (Sabatier process), requiring high temperature and pressure.2 Bio-electromethanogenesis or bio-power-to-gas, on the other hand, produces high-purity methane via microbial catalysts in aqueous solution at close to ambient pressure and temperature, thereby presenting a promising new alternative. The use of a biological catalyst offers advantages over the direct reduction of CO2via abiotic electrocatalysts or photocatalysts due to the high product selectivity of the microbial metabolism.
In bio-electromethanogenesis, hydrogen from electrochemical water splitting or cathodic electrons directly serve as the electron donor for the highly specific microbial reduction of CO2 to CH4.3,4 Even though methanogenic microorganisms can achieve high production rates when using hydrogen, most electromethanogenesis studies focused on direct electron transfer from carbon-based cathodes to the microorganism to circumvent low-solubility issues of H2 as electron carrier. This limits the achievable current densities and, therefore, production rates.5 Electrochemical hydrogen evolution, however, achieves simultaneously high current densities and selectivity.6 A direct integration of electrochemical H2 production and microbial methanogenesis could significantly increase rates. However, insights into the microbial physiology during long-term electromethanogenesis via in situ produced H2 are lacking.
We previously demonstrated that transition-metal-based electrodes catalyse the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at low overpotentials and 100% H2-selectivity under biologically relevant conditions (circumneutral pH, microbial growth medium).4 The most promising catalyst under these conditions was found to be a nickel–molybdenum alloy, an inexpensive and earth-abundant material, which can be easily plated electrochemically on nearly any cathode support material. Here, we integrated NiMo-electroplated graphite cathodes (catalysing electrolysis of water) with pure cultures of the methanogenic archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis (biocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4) in one long-term-electromethanogenesis application (cf.Fig. 1A). We used this platform to determine performance parameters of this new system and to obtain, for the first time, insights into the microbial metabolism, protein synthesis, microbial stress response, and growth yield of cells under long-term electromethanogenic conditions. These data are essential to assess whether inherent limitations in the microorganism exist that might prevent a volumetric and temporal scale-up of this technology. To obtain a better understanding of the physiological response of methanogenic cells to the electrochemical in situ hydrogen production, we compared microbial cultures grown in the integrated bioelectrochemical reactors to H2/CO2-grown control cultures. To our knowledge, this work presents the first in-depth investigation of microbial physiology under H2-mediated electromethanogenesis conditions.

Results and discussion
Long-term operation of electromethanogenesis
Two identical bio-electrochemical systems, labeled E-Chem1 and E-Chem2, were operated as continuous reactors for a period of one month. Both electrochemical systems were constantly supplied with gaseous CO2 as well as fresh growth medium. H2 was produced in situ at a constant rate by NiMo-coated cathodes. A control reactor, labeled H2-Control, consisted of the same reactor set-up; however, H2 was supplied from an external source via gas sparging instead of the cathodic in situ H2 production. H2 gas-flow in H2-Control and electric current in E-Chem 1 & 2 were adjusted to provide equal electron donor influx for each reactor. The electrolyte in all reactors was chemically defined microbial growth medium-JD (containing various salts and supplements, pH 7) as detailed in the Experimental section. The entire experiment was performed twice independently, referred to as Exp1 and Exp2 throughout the manuscript (see Experimental section for detailed description).
H2-Mediated electromethanogenesis
Direct integration of NiMo-cathodes with M. maripaludis resulted in stable production of methane from CO2 and electric current at coulombic efficiencies of close to 100%, indicating a highly effective microbial utilization of the in situ produced H2 (Fig. 2). The HER at the cathode surface produced hydrogen, which was instantly consumed as electron donor for the microbial reduction of CO2. Strong, turbulent agitation was critical to distribute H2 throughout the reactor volume and to avoid bubble formation on the cathode surface. At several times throughout the long-term experiments, the agitation in the reactors malfunctioned, which drastically decreased mixing, resulting in loss of hydrogen from the medium as bubbles and, therefore, reduced methane production rate (cf.Fig. 2A and B).
 Fig. 2  Methane production rates (A) and hydrogen flow rates (B) in the reactor off-gas as well as corresponding coulombic efficiencies of methane formation (C) during long-term experiment Exp2 with M. maripaludis. E-Chem1 and E-Chem2 are bio-electrochemical reactors using NiMo-cathodes and H2-Control presents a reactor featuring external H2-feed. Data points representing measurements taken while reactor performance was impaired (e.g. insufficient mixing) are shown but not connected with lines to aid visualization. 
With active stirring in place, reactors performed stably for the entire duration of the experiment (42 days). Interestingly, methane production of the electromethanogenic reactors was slightly elevated relative to the H2-Control, while the flux of electrons was almost identical in both types of reactors (see ESI† for additional discussion). The average volumetric methane production rates during the stable experiment period (Exp2, weeks 2–5) were 1.38 ± 0.07 L L−1 day−1 for E-Chem1 and E-Chem2 and 1.29 ± 0.06 L L−1 day−1 for the H2-Control.
To evaluate the performance of this integrated NiMo-catalyzed HER-methanogenesis system relative to other bio-electromethanogenesis systems, an extensive literature was performed and selected, representative studies are summarized in Table 1. Previously studied systems for bioelectrochemical power-to-gas displayed a large variety in reactor configuration, inoculum, operation strategy, and experimental conditions (cf.Table 1, for comprehensive reviews also refer to ref. 5 and 7).

This variety of set-ups and experimental strategies led to a broad range in reported volumetric methane production rates, current densities, and cathode potentials which all have to be considered when comparing overall system performance (cf.Table 1). Importantly, the here observed volumetric production rates of greater than 1.3 L L−1 day−1 do not only exceed previously reported rates but were also accompanied by impressively high and stable columbic efficiency. In previous electromethanogenesis studies, high methane production rates were generally achieved at the expense of efficiency and/or longevity of the system (see Table 1).
The cathode potential critically affects the mode of electron transfer (direct electron transfer or H2 evolution) as well as the current and, therefore, the resulting CH4 production rate.7 By operating the system at more negative cathode potential (further away from its thermodynamic equilibrium), higher current densities and production rates can be achieved. However, this additional energy input required to increase rates is lost as heat and not recovered in product. Therefore, the energy efficiency decreases with increasing rate, which results in a trade-off between rate and efficiency.20 Most electromethanogenesis systems use carbon-based cathodes (cf.Table 1) due to their high biocompatibility, low cost of the materials, as well as high specific surface area of e.g. carbon felt or graphite granules.21 By electrodeposition of NiMo on graphite-cathodes, our system achieved high current densities of 10 A m−2 at lower overpotential compared to carbon-based materials used in other studies even without the use of a high surface area 3D electrode (cf.Table 1). Importantly, the in situ produced hydrogen was efficiently metabolised by the microbes so that the process achieved an average coulombic efficiency of 98%, which was sustained for weeks. Similar high current efficiencies were previously achieved only at lower current densities and production rates, while higher volumetric methane production usually led to lower recovery of electrons (cf.Table 1).
Collectively, our data show that long-term electromethanogenesis at both high rate and high efficiency is possible using HER-cathodes and hydrogenotrophic methanogens.
Conditions for efficient operation

pH stability and cation migration. 
Maintaining a stable, circumneutral pH in the cathode chamber is critical to ensure stable methane formation by the M. mariplaudis culture. The pH in the cathode compartment is determined by (i) the electrical current applied (consumption of H+ at the cathode), (ii) H+ flux across the Nafion membrane (determined by the ΔpH across the membrane), and (iii) dilution rate with new, buffered medium. All parameters are dependent on each other; however, in a system operating in steady state these parameters are constant and, thus, result in a stable pH. During the initial start-up phase of operation, the pH greatly varied before steady state conditions were reached, and we found that operating the system abiotically during this time enabled rapid methane formation after inoculation (Exp2), compared to a simultaneous microbial and electrochemical start (Exp1, cf. Fig. 2 and Fig. S1†).
Additionally, we determined concentrations of the cations Ca, Co, Fe, K, Mg, Mo, Na and Ni via ICP-OES as these ions can potentially migrate through the Nafion membrane and plate on or be dissolved from the cathode. However, except for Ni and Mo (see below), none of those ions was found to accumulate or being removed significantly from either the cathode or anode chamber throughout the duration of the experiment.
For the here reported system, a stable pH of 7 was reached four days after starting 50 mA of total current, medium flow, and acidifying the anode with 250 mM H2SO4, which decreased the start-up time by increasing the ΔpH across the Nafion membrane. Once pH conditions were constant, the system was inoculated with M. maripaludis and stable methane production was reached within just 24 hours (E-Chem1), directly comparable to the H2-Control (see Fig. 2). In E-Chem2, the onset was slightly delayed due to technical issues with reactor stirring resulting in decreased hydrogen availability due to ebullition.
Thus, first establishing an electrochemically-active, pH-equilibrated reactor in the start-up phase before introducing the microorganism facilitated rapid electromethanogenesis from in situ produced hydrogen without requiring adaptation of the microbial culture to cathodic conditions.


Stability of the HER-cathodes. 
Efficient hydrogen production on NiMo electrodes under biomethanogenic conditions, including operation in the complex microbial media required as electrolyte, has previously been investigated for short operation times.4 Here, we investigated the possible dissolution of the inorganic HER-cathodes during long-term operation. At regular time intervals, we identified and quantified dissolved metals in the different reactor compartments during Exp1 by ICP-OES. Traces of nickel and molybdenum were found in the cathode compartments of E-Chem1 and E-Chem2 during week 1 only (average c(Ni,week 1) = 15.0 ± 1.5 μmol L−1 and average c(Mo,week 1) = 0.16 ± 0.23 μmol L−1, cf. Fig. S2†). These quantities likely resulted from residues of the plating solution that remained on the cathode surface and in the porous graphite rod after synthesis. Adsorbed metal ions (Ni and Mo metal salts) that were not reduced and did not form metallic bonds during the electrodeposition were likely not completely removed during rinsing and could dissolve and diffuse out of the porous graphite during the initial phase of the experiment. The constant supply of fresh medium removed these residues and after week 1, no Ni or Mo were detected (c(Ni,Mo) ≤ 0.05 ppb) in any of the reactors.
Further, the cathode potential remained with an average potential of −0.63 ± 0.07 V during Exp1 and −0.69 ± 0.1 V during Exp2 relatively constant throughout both long-term experiments (see Fig. S3†), indicating a high stability of the cathode material under constant current conditions. Thus, the electrochemical plating of graphite surfaces with NiMo promotes long-term electromethanogenesis by continuously lowering the overpotential for HER.


Cell physiology under electromethanogenic conditions. 
Since no studies have reported whether and how the cathodic electron delivery affects general physiology and metabolism of M. maripaludis, we conducted an in-depth physiological comparison under electromethanogenic vs. hydrogenotrophic conditions.


Increased metabolic activity under electrochemical conditions. 
The presented electromethanogenesis system using NiMo-coated electrodes relies on in situ produced H2 as electron carrier. Therefore, the electron uptake mechanism is independent of a direct contact between the cell surface and the cathode, and cells in all reactors were growing in a well-mixed suspension effectively on H2 and CO2. Indeed, no biofilm formation was observed and, thus, the measured OD values were an accurate quantification of total biomass in each reactor. Interestingly, during both long-term experiments differences in cell physiology, such as total biomass concentration and specific rate of methane formation, were observed between electrochemically grown and the H2 control-grown cells. Despite identical feed rates (medium dilution rate and electron donor supply), lower biomass concentrations were consistently recorded in E-Chem1 and E-Chem2 compared to H2-Control. During Exp1, the average OD600 under E-Chem conditions was 0.19 ± 0.03, significant lower compared to the H2-Control system, which had an average OD600 of 0.31 ± 0.04 (Exp2: E-Chem1 and E-Chem2 OD600,ave = 0.23 ± 0.08; H2-Control OD600,ave = 0.30 ± 0.04).
These significant differences in cell density combined with the relatively similar volumetric methane production rates between reactors show for the first time a higher cell-specific methane production rate of a pure culture of M. maripaludis when growing with in situ electrochemically produced H2 compared to H2/CO2-grown cells (see Fig. 3). This indicates a different molar growth yield (g biomass per mol methane formed) in these cultures. During Exp1, this effect was significantly more pronounced with the average specific methane production rate of E-Chem1 and E-Chem2 increased by 96% vs. H2-Control. Exp2 features an average increase of 19% in specific rate under E-Chem conditions.
 Fig. 3  Specific methane production rates during Exp1 (A) and Exp2 (B). E-Chem1 and E-Chem2 are bio-electrochemical reactors using NiMo-cathodes and H2-Control presents a reactor featuring external H2-feed. Each data point is the mean value from 11–16 independent measurements throughout the week for each reactor E-Chem1, E-Chem2 or H2-Control with error bars displaying the corresponding standard deviation. 
In Exp1, H2-Control was supplied with the standard gas mix for growing methanogens containing H2/CO2 in a ratio of 80/20 vol% and the H2 supply rate was matched to the in situ hydrogen production rates in the E-Chem reactors. However, this most likely caused CO2 limitation in this reactor, and, therefore, the gas mix for H2-Control was switched to H2/CO2 in a ratio of 75/25 vol% during Exp2 (see ESI† for additional discussion).
The higher specific activity in E-Chem reactors in Exp1 was a direct cause of the markedly higher biomass in the H2-Control compared to the E-Chem reactors. One sensible explanation for this increased biomass yield in the H2-Control during Exp1 compared to Exp2 is the potential CO2-limitation and, therefore, H2-excess conditions in the H2-Control. Lower yields have been reported for M. maripaludis under H2-excess conditions.22M. maripaludis is metabolically uncoupling methanogenesis and growth when nutrients such as nitrogen or phosphate are limiting.22 However, to our knowledge, CO2 limiting conditions have not been investigated previously.
Another possible reason for the observed decrease in biomass yield in the bio-electrochemical systems could be stress induced from contact with oxygenated environment (membrane surface), contact with polarized surfaces (cathode surface), or exposure to local, extreme pH gradients (membrane surface and cathode surface). A boundary layer of around 50–150 μm surrounding the cathode exists in a well-stirred electrochemical reactor and under identical current densities.4 Due to the cathodic hydrogen evolution through proton reduction, the pH in this boundary layer is more alkaline relative to the circumneutral pH of the bulk medium. The opposite is true for the interface of catholyte at the proton exchange membrane where locally high proton concentrations are present in the diffusive boundary layer.
We hypothesized that M. maripaludis cells, known to be particularly sensitive to elevated pH,23 responded with cell lysis to transient exposure to fluctuating local pH extremes. To test whether increased cell lysis indeed occurred in the electrochemical reactors, we determined the ratio of protein and DNA between full samples and the cell-free supernatant of the catholyte in Exp2. We found that in E-Chem1 and E-Chem2 the relative amount of cell free protein was on average about 1.6-times higher and the relative amount of cell-free DNA 2.5-times higher than in H2-Control, which indicated a higher cell lysis in these reactors (cf.Table 2). An increase in cell lysis implies a 5% and 12% higher total growth rate in the E-Chem reactors. Based on these data, the observed increased rate of methanogenesis is consistent with methane formation by cells that subsequently lysed, which can explain a large part of the 19% increased specific methanogenesis rate during Exp2.

We quantified protein and DNA content for cell-containing samples as well as cell-free samples and the displayed values are given as the fraction of cell-free DNA or protein in the supernatant over total DNA or protein in the catholyte including cells. Under electrochemical conditions, the relative amount of cell free protein was on average about 1.6-times higher and of cell-free DNA 2.5-times higher than in H2-Control

We also determined metabolic activity of M. maripaludis under the different conditions by tracking protein synthesis via iorthogonal on-anonical mino acid agging (BONCAT).24 Once a week, the reactors were spiked with the alkyne-tagged amino acid homopropargylglycine (HPG), and its subsequent incorporation into cell protein was measured via fluorescence microscopy. HPG is incorporated into newly synthesized protein instead of methionine, and, therefore, label intensity increases with the amount of newly synthesised protein. Because cell mass consists of about 50% protein, a high label intensity in a cell indicates high synthesis of new cell mass and growth, while detection of unlabelled cells indicates the absence of significant growth during the labelling interval. E-Chem reactors in Exp1 showed 15–20% higher average intensity values of 6672 ± 145 (E-Chem1) and 7070 ± 144 (E-Chem2) compared to 5695 ± 141 for H2-Control (mean ± SEM), indicating a higher cellular protein synthesis rate and faster cell growth of M. maripaludis under E-Chem conditions. Combined with the lower steady-state cell concentration in these reactors, these data provide additional evidence for increased cell lysis in the E-Chem reactors.
Microscopically, we also observed that intact cells in the electrochemical reactors were significantly larger than in the control reactor. For Exp1, in weeks 2 to 4 the observed average cell diameter of 1.49 ± 0.015 (E-Chem1) and 1.51 ± 0.014 (E-Chem2) versus 1.40 ± 0.015 μm (H2-Control; mean ± SEM) translates into 30–70% additional volume per cell in the electrochemical systems. Together, enhanced cell lysis and increased cell volume explains at least part of the increased specific methanogenesis rates in the electrochemical systems.


Proteome under electromethanogenesis. 
To gain further insights into the physiology of M. maripaludis under electrosynthesis conditions, we performed proteomic analyses on electrochemically and H2/CO2-grown cells. For Exp1, the content of 200 proteins varied between the conditions; however, for Exp2, only 10 proteins were found to be differently abundant (cf. Table S3†). This indicates that the ratio of H2 to CO2 had a measurable impact on the physiology of the methanogens (see above and additional discussion in the ESI†). Overall, the electrochemical culturing conditions did not induce drastic changes in protein expression of M. maripaludis. None of the essential proteins in the methanogenesis pathway (see Fig. 1B) were found to be differentially expressed between the two conditions.
Among the proteins consistently less abundant in the E-Chem systems (Exp1 and Exp2) is formate dehydrogenase (FdhA1B1), which is induced in M. maripaludis under hydrogen limitation.22 Therefore, Fdh expression level indicates an increased availability of in situ produced H2 in the E-Chem system. Also, the putative iron III uptake pathway proteins Q6LY13 and Q6LY15 were more abundant in H2/CO2-fed cultures; however, the physiological significance is unclear.
Importantly, the absence of a significant general proteomic difference between electromethanogenically- and hydrogenotrophically-grown M. maripaludis cells indicates that the cells do not perceive a pronounced difference in their environmental conditions that translates into a different physiological state. A previous study targeting the proteomic response to hydrogen-, phosphate-, or nitrogen-limitation revealed more pronounced differences than our study comparing integrated electrochemical and hydrogenotrophic growth.25 Thus, the overall metabolism of M. maripaludis is largely unaffected by the electromethanogenic conditions, even over prolonged periods of time, and the increased level of Fdh in H2-Control could indicate H2 limitation in this reactor.

Conclusions
The here presented integrated bioelectrochemical system using NiMo-cathodes and pure culture of the archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis demonstrated long-term stability of electromethanogenesis at high volumetric production rate and coulombic efficiency. This is due to a more efficient utilization of in situ electrochemically produced H2 relative to externally added gaseous H2. Such in situ production of H2 can be highly advantageous also for gas fermentation technologies, where mixing of low soluble gases such as H2 presents a major technical, economic, and safety challenge.26,27
While we observed an increase in specific methane production rate and cell lysis of M. maripaludis under E-Chem conditions versus H2-grown control cultures, no significant difference in physiology, proteome composition, and protein synthesis were found, indicating that M. maripaludis cells have no inherent limitation for forming a robust, efficiently performing platform for long-term power-to-gas conversion. Cells in the electrochemical reactor do not appear to experience and react significantly to different environmental conditions caused by the different H2 sources. This microbial property likely contributes to the rapid start-up time of stable electromethanogenesis during Exp2.
Overall, the system presents a promising strategy for bio-electrochemical power-to-gas applications as the electrochemical as well as microbial catalyst show excellent long-term stability and columbic efficiency.

Medium-JD contained per liter: 30 g Na2SO4, 4 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2 g KH2PO4, 0.4 g NH4HCO3, 0.6 g KHCO3, 0.04 g CaCl2, 7.2 g morpholinepropanesulfonic (MOPS) acid, 3.4 g MOPS Na-salt, 1 ml selenite–tungstate solution, 1 ml trace element solution SL-10, 1 g NaS2O3, 0.4 g cysteine-HCl and 30 mL of 1 M NaHCO3 solution. Selenite–tungstate solution contained per liter: 0.5 g NaOH, 3 mg Na2SeO3·5H2O, 4 mg Na2WO4·2H2O. Trace element solution SL-10 contained per liter: 10 ml HCl (25%; 7.7 M), 1.5 g FeCl2·4H2O, 70 mg ZnCl2, 100 mg MnCl2·4H2O, 6 mg H3BO3 190 mg CoCl2·6H2O, 2 mg CuCl2·2H2O, 24 mg NiCl2·6H2O, 36 mg Na2MoO4·2H2O. The final medium-JD was prepared from autoclaved anoxic stock solutions under continuous gassing with CO2/N2 (20/80% v/v). The final pH was 6.8.

M. maripaludis was routinely grown in batch cultures in medium-JD under H2/CO2 (80/20%v/v) gas atmosphere at 30 °C and 200 rpm. Each reactor was inoculated with 1% (%v/v) of an exponentially growing culture.
Cathode fabrication
The cathode material for in situ hydrogen evolution were NiMo-alloys previously identified as particularly suited for direct integration with bio-electrosynthesis.4 The cathodes were synthesized by electrodeposition of nickel and molybdenum on graphite rods as follows. Conductive graphite bars (McMaster-Carr) with a total surface area of 10 cm2 each (disregarding pores and surface roughness) were placed in NiMo-plating solution in ∼1 cm distance to a surrounding anode (platinized titanium mesh (1 inch × 4 inch, TWL, Amazon.com). NiMo-plating solution contained per liter: 40 g NiCl2·6H2O, 25 g Na2MoO4·2H2O, 45 g sodium citrate. The pH was adjusted to 10 with NH4OH. Under constant magnetic stirring at 900 rpm, a constant current of 2 A (per 10 cm2 electrode) was applied for 2 minutes. The cathodes were rinsed in deionized water before use in the bio-electrochemical system. Fig. S4† provides an image of the cathode before and after NiMo alloying (see ESI, Fig. S4†).
Reactor set up and operation
Three reactors were run as chemostats in parallel for a period of about a month. Two duplicate electrochemical reactors, E-Chem1 and E-Chem2, were supplied with gaseous CO2 as sole carbon source while H2 was supplied as electron donor via the cathodic reduction of protons. The third reactor (labeled H2-Control throughout the manuscript) was used for comparison and was supplied with a gaseous mix of H2 and CO2. Gas flow rates and electric current were adjusted to provide equal electron donor supply for each reactor (electrons for E-Chem1 and E-Chem2 and gaseous H2 for Control). The entire experiment was performed two times, referred to as Exp1 and Exp2 throughout the manuscript. During Exp1, the gas-mix for H2-Control was H2/CO2 80/20 vol%, which was changed to 75/25 vol% for Exp2 to match conditions in the E-Chem systems.
The reactor vessels are customized two-chambered borosilicate gastight H-cells (Adams & Chittenden, Scientific Glass, Berkeley, CA, USA). The two chambers have a volume of 150 mL each and were separated by a Nafion 117 proton-exchange membrane (Fuel Cell Store Inc., College Station, TX, USA, surface area 4.9 cm2). The membrane prevents the transfer of oxygen into the cathode chamber to ensure anaerobic conditions and to prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species at the cathode as reported previously.29
Five NiMo coated graphite cathodes, fabricated as reported above, were inserted into the cathode compartments of E-Chem1 and E-Chem2via a gastight rubber stopper (total geometric surface area of 50 cm2 per reactor). The anode was a platinized titanium mesh (1′′ × 4′′, TWL, Amazon) and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (NaCl saturated; RE-5B, BASI) was inserted into the cathode chamber via a rubber stopper side port. The electrochemical reactors were controlled by applying a constant current of −50 mA per reactor using a multichannel potentiostat (VMP3; Bio-Logic Science Instruments, EC-Lab software version 11.21, Seyssinet-Pariset, France). All potentials indicated in this article are relative to SHE.
The cathode chamber of each reactor was continuously sparged with gas via a porous glass frit (porosity 4–8 μm Sigma Aldrich) and the gas feed rates were controlled using mass flow controllers (EL-Flow F-100D, Bronkhorst). Flowrates were for Exp1: 0.14 mL min−1 (CO2 100%) for E-Chem1 and E-Chem2 and 0.47 mL min−1 (H2/CO2 80/20% v/v) for H2-Control and Exp2: 0.14 mL min−1 (CO2 100%) for E-Chem1 and E-Chem2 and 0.49 mL min−1 (H2/CO2 75/25% v/v) for H2-Control, respectively.
Each chamber was filled with 100 mL of medium-JD under anaerobic conditions and magnetically stirred at 800 rpm. A reservoir bottle of 10 L anoxic medium-JD was connected via peristaltic pump at a constant feed rate of 0.0676 ± 0.0025 mL min−1 per cathode chamber. The effluent was collected in separate glass bottles for each reactor. Liquid samples were taken through rubber side ports at regular intervals. Samples for gas analysis were taken from the respective reactor headspace with a gas syringe (Series A-2, VICI Precision Sampling, Baton Rouge, LA, USA). Volumetric gas flow rates of the reactor off gas were measured via Milligas counter (KG MGC-1, PMMA/PVDF, Ritter Apparatebau GmbH & Co. Germany) at regular intervals. All reactors were operated at ambient pressure in a temperature-controlled room at 30 °C.
Analytical methods
The gaseous compounds methane and hydrogen were measured using a gas chromatograph (equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detection detector, Agilent) as described previously.30
Coulombic efficiencies were calculated by dividing the electrons recovered in methane by the electrons supplied as current at a certain time point according to eqn (1) below. With η(CH4,t) = mol CH4 at time point t; f(e,CH4) = molar conversion factor (8 electrons per mol CH4); F = Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1 of electron) and I = electric current. (1)
Cell densities were measured as optical density (OD) via Spectroscopy at 600 nm (Ultrospec 2100 pro, Amersham BioSciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom).
Determination of OD and cell dry weight correlation
To express specific methane production rates in respect to biomass concentration, we determined the correlation between culture OD and dry cell weight via the following method. 30–50 mL of culture of different ODs was harvested via vacuum filtration on mixed cellulose membrane filters (pore diameter 45 μm; HAWP04700; Merck Millipore), which were dried at 65 °C for 72 hours before measuring cell dry weight. The correlation coefficient between culture OD and dry cell weight was measured to be 0.34 ± 0.03.
DNA and protein measurements
To determine cell lysis in the reactors, we compared DNA as well as protein content of full reactor samples to cell-free solutions. DNA and protein content were measured by Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Invitrogen) and Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), respectively. To produce supernatent, cells were removed by centrifugation (10000g, 10 min, 4 °C). Both, full samples and supernatants were stored at −80 °C until further analysis. To measure DNA and protein content in full samples, complete cell lysis was achieved by addition of 0.01% SDS.31
To measure DNA content, lysed full samples or supernatant was first treated with RNase A (New England Biolab) at 30 °C for 30 min to remove RNA. The samples were then added to Qubit reaction buffer with DNA fluorescence dye following manufacturer's instruction. The fluorescence was measured by Qubit 4 fluorometer (ThermoFisher) as reading 1. Subsequently, the samples were incubated with DNase (New England Biolab) at 37 °C overnight to remove DNA and were measured again by Qubit assay to obtain a background reading. The DNA content was calculated by subtracting the background reading from reading 1. Such RNase and DNase treatments were sufficient as further digestion did not result in changes in fluorescence reading.
For Bradford assay, protein content in lysed full samples and supernatant were quantified following the manufacturer's instruction. Colour change in the assays was measured by microplate reader Infinite® M1000 (Tecan) at 595 nm.
Bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT)
For Boncat measurements, 0.5 mM of homopropargylglycine was added to the microbe compartments of the H-cell reactors and incubated for 6 h to allow for incorporation of the amino acid into cell biomass. Samples were taken aseptically and using anaerobic technique with sterile syringe. Samples were distributed into Eppendorf tubes and pelleted at 8000 rcf for 8 min. Cells were fixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C at least overnight. All fixed samples were treated and stained with Atto565-azide (Atto-tec, Germany) in one batch as described previously24 and analyzed the same day to avoid fading of the signal. Cells were analyzed microscopically, by acquiring images of cells at identical settings and performing image analysis with ImageJ. In short, cells were segmented based on DNA staining with DAPI, and size and signal intensity of the DNA stain DAPI and the BOCAT signal ATTO-565 was recorded of the segmented spheres.
Proteomics
Samples for proteomic analysis were taken in weeks 1, 2, and 3 for Exp1, and in weeks 1, 3, and 5 for Exp2. Samples were taken out of the reactors with a sterile syringe, transferred to Eppendorf tubes, spun down at 10000 rcf for 5 min. Cell pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Samples were thawed and immediately suspended in 0.1% SDS in PBS to lyse the cells. Cleared lysate was handed to the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry facility at Stanford University (see ESI† for detailed description of proteomic workflow).
In short, raw data were analyzed with MaxQuant 1.6.14.0. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE32 partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD019312 and 10.6019/PXD019312. The corrected intensities were normalized per sample and imported into Perseus Version 1.6.10.50. Data were log(2) transformed and significantly differentially abundant proteins were identified by T-test (FDR 0.05, S0 = 0.5) comparing all samples from E-Chem reactors (n = 6) with all samples from H2-Control (n = 3) for each experiment. The Perseus analysis is also available in the PXD019312 dataset.
Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES)
Concentrations of the metallic cations Ca, Co, Fe, K, Mg, Mo, Na and Ni were determined weekly for both cathode and anode chamber of each reactor. Filtered liquid samples were dissolved in 2% nitric acid and metal ion concentration was determined via ICP-OES (Thermo Scientific ICAP 6300 Duo View Spectrometer equipped with solid State CID Detector) at the Environmental Measurements Facility, Stanford University.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (A) Scheme of the integrated bioelectrochemical system for electromethanogenesis. The catalytic electrolysis of water leads to evolution of hydrogen on the NiMo cathode in the microbial growth chamber. The H2 is used for the biocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane by Methanococcus maripaludis. (B) Simplified native metabolic pathway of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in M. maripaludis. Electrons from 2 mol H2 are split between reducing ferredoxin and regenerating coenzymes B and M (electron bifurcation). Reduced ferredoxin from this reaction links to CO2 reduction, the first step in the pathway. The organism conserves energy in form of ATP via a transmembrane sodium gradient. Metabolites: CoM, coenzyme M; CoB, coenzyme B; F420 coenzyme F420; Fdred, reduced ferredoxin; Fdox, oxidized ferredoxin; MF, methanofuran; MPT, methanopterin.
