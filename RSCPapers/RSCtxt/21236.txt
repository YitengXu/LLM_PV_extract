1. Introduction
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have been demonstrated to potentially provide novel opportunities for next-generation lighting sources and information displays owing to their high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), and tunable and narrow emission bandwidth.1–7 QD materials perform an appealing combination with the quantum confinement effect, improving their optical and electronic properties, and versatile surface chemistry, allowing dispersion in diverse solvents and matrices and subsequent integration with various devices.1,8,9 Quantum dot light-emitting devices (QLEDs) have been favored by visionary companies in recent decades due to their high color purity, low energy consumption, and cost-effectiveness, when compared to commercial organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). Besides, the color gamut of QLEDs reaches up to 140% of the North American National Television Standard Committee (NTSC), which transcends that of typical OLED displays.10 So far, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of Cd-based QLEDs can reach up to 20.5%,11 comparable to the commercial OLEDs.12
The boosted global reliance on QLEDs entails the exploration of more cost-effective and efficient emitting materials.8 Metal halide perovskite (MHP) QDs have appeared as an effective paradigm of colloidal nanocrystal (NC) candidates for both basic research studies and practical applications due to their superior optical properties and fascinating chemical processability.10,13–17 Although materials with a perovskite structure have been long known to show favorable physical properties, such as ferroelectricity, superconductivity, and colossal magnetoresistance,18 they have never exerted influence on the area of optoelectronics until the recent decade. Colloidal MHP QDs can be readily processed in solution, allowing the fast, large-area, and cost-effective production of emitting layers, and compatibility with flexible/stretchable elecronics.21–24 The structural and chemical diversity of the MHP QDs facilitate a wide scope of optoelectronic applications.25–27 The synthesis of colloidal MHP QDs with high crystal quality is exceedingly critical, while various effective methods have been developed.13–15,19,28,29 By engineering the chemical composition and structure, the PLQY of perovskite QDs has been near unity.30–32 Besides, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of perovskite QLEDs has been increased to greater than 10%.33–35 Chiba and Kido exhibited the most efficient red emissive perovskite QLEDs with the maximum EQE approaching 21.3% by an effective anion-exchange strategy using halide-anion-containing alkyl ammonium and aryl ammonium salts.36 This contribution demonstrates a significant stride in the perovskite-based QLED field. It is worth noting that the first television demon based on perovskite nanocrystals has been presented at CES 2018 exhibition. Despite the rapid advances in perovskite QLEDs in recent years, their commercial applications in information displays and lighting sources remain a challenge. The device efficiency needs to be further improved to surpass the traditional QLEDs and OLEDs. The long-term stability of the perovskite QLEDs in an atmospheric environment requires dramatic progress. Furthermore, the development of environmentally friendly perovskite QLEDs would require lead cation alternatives which has already been a recent report topic.
In this review, we address the characteristics of perovskite QDs and their applications in high quality LEDs. We discuss the different types of perovskite QDs along with the fundamental photophysical properties and synthesis methods. We present the strategies to optimize the optical and electronic properties of perovskite QDs by structure modulation, size effect regulation, and surface engineering. We investigate the evolution of device performance and the application of perovskite QDs in the flexible/stretchable electronics field. In conclusion, we demonstrate the recent development and future outlook to circumvent the toxicity and instability of perovskite QLEDs.
2. Perovskite nanocrystal fundamentals
2.1 Perovskite structure
Perovskites were originally referenced to the mineral CaTiO3, but now they present a series of materials with the same crystal structure with the formula ABX3.37,38 A is an organic/inorganic cation (Cs+, CH3NH3+ (MA+), CH(NH2)2+ (FA+), or mixtures thereof), B is a metal cation (Pb2+, Sn2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Bi3+, or mixtures thereof), and X is a halide anion (Br−, Cl−, I−, or mixtures thereof). The motif is composed of a corner-sharing BX6 octahedral structure, counterbalanced by the cations MA+, FA+ and Cs+ or mixtures thereof filling in the cavity between the octahedron. It is worth noting that the filling of the A-site in the BX6 octahedral cavity needs to satisfy the Goldschmidt tolerance factor t and the octahedral coefficient μ.39,40 (1) (2)where rA, rB, and rX represent the ionic radii of the corresponding cations and anion, respectively. Typically stable perovskites should feature t ranging from 0.8 to 1.0 with μ from 0.41 to 0.89. The value of t assesses whether the A-site cation fits within the cavities in the framework. When it is close to 1, the perovskite exhibits a symmetrical cubic phase; otherwise, tilting of the octahedron will occur, resulting in a tetragonal or orthorhombic structure. Only cubic and partially tilted variants can possess the desirable semiconducting properties as shown in Fig. 1a.25 Among the 15 possible octahedral distortions of a cubic perovskite structure, orthorhombic CsPbBr3 is the only exception which maintains the 3D connectivity, while other 1D polymorphs present wider bandgaps and entail poor charge transport. This structural framework supplies huge flexibility for the composition tuning of the MHP family and their performance design.

The wide structural diversity in the perovskites makes them a compelling material platform as a next-generation light-emitter. Although superior charge transport and optical properties have been demonstrated for the stable metal halide perovskites, the high photoluminescence quantum yield remains a challenge. Low-dimensional perovskites, namely perovskite QDs, have been introduced to address this critical point and further tune the light emission.
2.2 Optical and electronic properties
When the size of perovskite NCs is lower than the Bohr radius, the quantum confinement effect is introduced.41,42 In contrast to bulk or single crystals, perovskite QDs present improved optical and electronic properties due to their low trap densities, high surface-to-volume ratio, and versatile functionalization.43 The PLQY of colloidal perovskite QDs exceeding 90% makes them appealing materials to apply in information displays and lighting sources (Fig. 1b).10 Perovskite QDs align the synthetic tenability of covalent organic molecules with the optical and electronic versatility of ionic inorganic solids. Their crystalline structures, combining with a broad series of organic molecule, metal, halogen and ligand components, can be synthetically tuned to accommodate various applications. The perovskite QDs feature brighter and narrower photoluminescence (PL) with remarkable color purity when compared to typical organic polymers, dyes, and phosphors. Such QDs present a tunable spectral range by both halide composition tuning and quantum confinement effect (Fig. 1c),10 stimulating the perovskite QD-based light-emitting devices closer to their commercialization, in case their key issues of low stability and toxicity are settled.44,45 They can also achieve a wider gamut than the NTSC specification (Fig. 1d).10 Besides, the perovskite QDs can be feasibly fabricated in solution, allowing the cost-effective spin-coating manufacturing approach to achieve a fast, flexible, and large-area production of devices. Compared to other inorganic semiconductor colloidal materials such as Cd chalcogenides and GaAs, highly crystalline perovskite QDs can be readily prepared even at room temperature as a consequence of the ionic lattice.46 Furthermore, the colloidal QDs can be combined with other functional materials, such as small molecules or polymers to fulfil the enhanced optoelectronic characteristics.47–49
2.3 Synthesis methods
To date, numerous contributions have focused on the detailed perovskite QD synthesis methods10,13–17,19,50–72 and herein we briefly introduce the crucial principles and mainstream development. Superlative perovskite QDs for light-emitting devices should feature controlled size and uniform size distribution, which allows for the stringent color emission. A high degree of crystallinity and surface passivation are also essential to eliminate surface traps and avoid fluorescence quenching. Through the exploration of various synthetic routes and controlling of the related dominant factors, including the precursor ratio, reaction temperature, and the types and amount of capping ligands, perovskite QDs with tunable nanocrystal sizes, morphologies and optical properties can be achieved.
Perovskite QDs can be synthesized by both ex situ methods in a flask and in situ routes on substrates, owing to their good dissolution in polar solvents arising from ionic nature.50 Lead bromide perovskite QDs were first employed by an in situ template-assisted strategy making efficient use of self-organization with aluminum oxide in 2012.51 The MAPbBr3 QDs exhibited high luminescence with a narrow bandwidth. Kovalenko et al. also reported a cost-effective and scalable perovskite QD fabrication method with the use of mesoporous silica templates in 2016, formed by infiltration of a precursor into template pores and drying (Fig. 2a).19 The QDs prepared by the template-assisted synthetic route exhibited pore-size-dependent luminance, along with the quantum confinement effect.52 This in situ approach promoted the synthesis of labile ligand-free perovskite QDs with improved thermal stability.53 Besides, the size distribution and further optical properties of perovskite nanocrystals can be controlled by regulating the template. However, the insulating characteristics of the mesoporous template impeded the electroluminescence (EL) of QDs, resulting in a modest performance in the corresponding LEDs.

Galian and Pérez-Prieto introduced an ex situ hot-injection method to prepare highly crystalline 6 nm-sized MAPbBr3 perovskite QDs with a medium-sized chain in 2014.13 The ammonium ions functioned as passivating ligands, causing stably dispersible QDs (for at least 3 months) in organic solvents with moderate polarity. Highly fluorescent quantum dot films and first LEDs were obtained based on the colloidal solution, though their emission quantum yield was only around 20%. The instability of uncoordinated surface atoms in perovskite QDs should be deliberated owing to the large surface-to-volume ratio. The PLQY of MAPbBr3 QDs was enhanced to 83% through fine-tuning of precursor ratios and surface passivation ligands by the same group in 2015.14 The hot injection method is a cost-effective and scalable method originally aimed at the hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite QD synthesis, and subsequently extended to the all-inorganic perovskite QDs (Fig. 2b).17
The all-inorganic monodisperse CsPbX3 QDs were first demonstrated by Kovalenko et al. with a high PLQY of 90% following the hot-injection synthesis methodology.10 The emission spectra were tunable through the range of 400–700 nm with widths of 12–42 nm by compositional bandgap engineering and quantum size-effects. The CsPbX3 nanocrystals exhibited enhanced optical properties and chemical durability, which made them fascinating for optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, the same group performed the cationic adjustment by the introduction of FA+ to synthesize the FAPbBr3 nanocrystal QDs.54 The hot-injection synthesis method was also used here to achieve stable emission at 530–535 nm. Sargent and Bakr further enhanced the stability of CsPbX3 QDs by exploiting a ligand-exchange strategy in 2017.15 Efficient green and blue LEDs based on the passivated quantum dots were realized with maximum EQEs of 3.0% and 1.1%. Kovalenko et al. performed the A-site modulation by the introduction of FA+ to synthesize FAPbI3 and FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 QDs, and overcame the “perovskite red wall”.55 A facile ligand-assisted synthesis method was demonstrated in this work for obtaining the highly efficient and stable FAPbI3 and FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 QDs with a uniform size and nearly cubic shape. Furthermore, the quantum dots reached high PLQYs of >70% for months and the corresponding FAPbI3 QD-based LEDs exhibited an EQE of 2.3%. Rogach synthesized CsPbX3 QDs capped with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) and further used it in all-perovskite white LEDs.56
Zhong and co-workers developed another ex situ synthesis strategy-ligand-assisted re-precipitation (LARP) to produce colloidal MAPbX3 QDs with PLQY up to 70% (Fig. 2c).16 Herein, the addition of long chain organic ligands and the selection of solvents are key parameters to enhance the stability of perovskite QDs. Besides the capping ligands, the precipitation temperature also has an important influence on the formation and the optoelectronic properties of MAPbBr3 QDs. Rogach et al. reported the first demonstration of the size-tuned bandgap in MAPbBr3 perovskite QDs under the control of reaction temperature by tailoring the re-precipitation process.57 The PLQY can reach up to 93% with the temperature at 60 °C, resulting from the efficient surface passivation with long chains and the high crystallinity of the QDs at high temperature. This indicated that elevated temperatures boosted the formation of large perovskite QDs ascribed to the rapid nuclear growth in hot reactions, similar to the traditional inorganic QDs, PbS for instance.58 Later on, Zhong and Pei reported an emulsion LARP technique by controlled dropping of a demulsifier into the perovskite precursor to synthesize the colloidal perovskite QDs (Fig. 2d).59 These quantum dots could be purified to remove partial ligands and obtained powders, which were re-dissolved for film fabrication and benefited device performance. The PLQY of such QDs reached as high as 92%, and can be preserved to 80% after purification. Zhang and Jie also used the LARP method to synthesize the organometal halide perovskite quantum dots and demonstrated a facile one-step dip-coating technique to produce uniform perovskite QDs with high-quality.60 Zeng et al. presented the synthesis of all-inorganic CsPbX3 quantum dots at room temperature (RT) for the first time with the supersaturated recrystallization (SR, modified LARP) method.61 The simple formation of perovskite QDs even at room temperature can be attributed to their highly ionic nature. These CsPbX3 QDs had superior optical properties, including PLQYs of 70%, 95%, and 80% for blue, green, and red emissions. Zhong and Chang further developed a modified emulsion synthesis method, named the phase transfer strategy, to fabricate gram-scale MAPbBr3 QDs with blue emission.62 The corresponding QDs showed an emission peak of 453 nm with an FWHM of 14 nm, and chemical yields greater than 70%.
Moreover, Zhong and co-workers reported an effective in situ fabrication of perovskite QDs combined with the PVDF matrix and obtained QDs with an average size of 5 nm.63 Strong interactions between the –CF2– group and MA+ have a significant influence on the uniform size and spatial distribution of perovskite QDs. The composite films exhibited high PLQYs achieving to 94.6 ± 1%. Recently, the same group demonstrated an in situ fabrication of FAPbI3 NCs and discussed the solvent effects of on-chip crystallization.64 With the introduction of γ-butyrolactone (GBL), PLQYs of FA0.87Cs0.13PbI3 NCs with red emission up to 70% were realized.
Grätzel and Lewiński reported an efficient room-temperature mechano-chemical synthesis of MAPbI3 with the size of several hundred nanometers, starting with MAI and PbI2 reagents.65 The hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite MAPbI3 showed an exact stoichiometric composition and high thermal stability. Heinz et al. developed the synthesis of organic–inorganic perovskite large sheets with a thickness of 2.4 nm, prepared by mechanical exfoliation.66 The nanosheets were direct semiconductors with a bandgap of 2.4 eV and showed bright photoluminescence. However, these perovskite nanosheets were not suitable for the applications of LEDs owing to their low PLQYs. Polavarapu and Urban demonstrated a ligand-assisted exfoliation approach to fabricate colloidal 2D organic–inorganic halide perovskite NCs.67 The resulting perovskite NCs showed improved QYs up to 70% and tunable optical properties through the entire visible spectrum by varying composition and thickness. Quan et al. explored a cost-effective micelle method to synthesize stable core–shell colloidal perovskite QDs. They chose polystyrene-block-poly-2-vinylpyridine (PS-b-P2VP) to function as the micelle template. The P2VP block and the lead precursor (PbBr2) can establish effective binding through intramolecular interaction and further passivate the surface (Fig. 2e).68 Na and co-workers synthesized colloidal CsPbX3 QDs by microwave irradiation with high throughput and in a single step. Tunable properties and morphologies can be achieved via this method (Fig. 2f).69
3 Optimization of the optoelectronic properties
The optoelectronic properties of MHP QDs can be fine-controlled via the structure modulation and quantum confinement effect.73–75 Besides, in-depth comprehension of the thermodynamics and kinetics in the perovskite QD formation process is vital for the optimization of their luminance quality. Moreover, ligand interaction is an effective approach to passivate surface uncoordinated atoms and further enhance the stability of perovskite QDs. Feasible strategies to address these challenges to date and their toxicity aspects of perovskite technology are elaborated and summarized in this section.
3.1 Structure modulation
In the general chemical formula of ABX3 perovskites, the A-site cation mainly determines the structure of the perovskite and further influences the optical properties and stabilities of the quantum dots. The bandgap of perovskites can be adjusted by the component regulation of all the cations and anions. An improvement in the A-site cation radius results in an increase in the M–X bond length and eventually enlarges the lattice of perovskites, related to a decrease of the bandgap. The radii (R) of typical A-site cations follow the trend of RCs+ < RMA+ < RFA+.26 Among them, the all-inorganic perovskites with Cs+ anions have showed higher thermal, chemical and photostabilities.10,15,73 Li and Yang indicated that when the A-site cation (MA+) was substituted by a larger ion such as FA+, the tolerance factor t tended to be closer to 1, resulting in a good crystal stability.76 Later on, Levchuk and co-workers elucidated FAPbX3 QD synthesis with a size of 15–25 nm by the LARP method for the first time.77 FAPbX3 featured a cubic morphology with PLQY up to 85%. Compared to conventional MA+ or Cs+ based perovskite QDs, FA+ exhibited stronger ionic interaction with halogen anions due to their larger size. As a consequence, FAPbX3 presented higher moisture and thermal stability, and was a potential candidate for LEDs. Zhong and Jiang presented FAPbX3 QDs with the bandgaps of 2.720 eV, 2.115 eV, and 1.401 eV by the anion-exchange method. The QDs featured a high PLQY of 85% and narrow FWHMs of 20.6 nm, 22 nm, and 36.6 nm.78 Zhang, Chen, and Sun further developed FA1−xCsxPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals with mixed cations under a PLQY of 73% and obtained LEDs reaching the highest brightness of 55005 cd m−2 in 2017.79 These results demonstrated that Cs+ replacing the FA+ ion in the A-site could achieve better crystallinity and stability. Besides FA and Cs cations, ethylammonium (EA) was also exploited to fill in the A-site and the EAxMA1−xPbBr3 QDs were fabricated with a one-pot approach at room temperature.80 EAxMA1−xPbBr3 QDs exhibited a tunable bandgap by modulation of the EA+ cation ratio. It is worth noting that the bandgap is defined in this case between the Pb 6s–Br 4p hybridized orbitals and Pb 6p levels. This leads to the increased bandgap upon the insertion of larger A-site cations, likely EA (Fig. 3a).80 The PLQYs of these QDs ranged from 5% to 85%, along with the lifetime of 1.4–215 ns.

The B-site is usually a divalent metal cation such as lead(II) (Pb2+), tin(II) (Sn2+), manganese(II) (Mn2+), cadmium(II) (Cd2+), zinc(II) (Zn2+), nickel(II) (Ni2+) or heterovalent bismuth(III) (Bi3+).81–85 The differences in the B–X bond length and angle affect the bandgap and corresponding emission wavelength.86 Pb2+ is the most common B-site cation applied in the perovskite QDs due to the higher PLQYs and stability. However, the major impediment to the commercialization of perovskite QDs originates legislation such as Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS).25 The RoHS controls the dosage of heavy metals in optoelectronic devices. Pb2+ is inherently toxic and not friendly to the environment, making it urgent to explore alternative B-site compounds as a replacement. Doping ions into host materials and replacing with other non-lead analogous metals ions, the optical properties of the NCs generally change sharply owing to the imbalance in the electronic dimensionality.87 Density functional theory (DFT) can supply a solid support in screening promising candidates for valid molecular designs, relying on bandgap and thermodynamic stability estimates.88–91 Sn2+ is one of the few non-toxic elements that have been experimentally proven to replace Pb2+.81,82 Böhm and co-workers synthesized CsSnX3 QDs with a tunable bandgap spanning from 2.8 to 1.3 eV by anionic composition adjustment. However, Sn2+ was vulnerable to oxidation and rapidly oxidized to Sn4+ under an ambient atmosphere, which could be attributed to the high intrinsic defect density.81 To address this oxidation issue, Wang and Deng proposed an innovative strategy by replacing divalent lead (Pb2+) with tetravalent tin (Sn4+) cations and synthesized stable Cs2SnI6 perovskite QDs.92 Although Sn4+ was more stable than Sn2+ under ambient conditions, the Sn4+ based QDs featured an extremely low PLQY of 0.48%, which was not suitable for light-emitting applications. Wang and Sun demonstrated the first synthesis of CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskite QDs with mixed-metal cations. However, the corresponding perovskite QDs also exhibited low ionic conductivity due to the surface defects and instability of materials.93 Deng and co-workers demonstrated the CsSnBr3 cubic nanocages for the first time through hot-injection methods.94 The CsSnBr3 nanocages showed superior oxygen-proof under desiccation conditions. After further treatment with perfluorooctanoic acid, CsSnBr3 nanocages could exhibit an increased stability against light, moisture, and oxygen. Klimov et al. presented a new family of doped magnetic (Mn) transition metal ions into CsPbX3 QDs.83 The bandgap was finely and reversibly tuned to achieve an energy ranging from 1.8 to 3.1 eV through postsynthetic anion exchange. Mn-Doping with diffusion endowed the energy transfer from the host material to Mn and led to yellow-orange d–d emission. Mn-Doped CsPbCl3 QDs maintained their crystal structures for several months under ambient conditions, demonstrating relative stability. Fig. 3b shows the energy transfer mechanism of Mn-doped CsPbCl3 QDs.83 Meijerink et al. proposed Mn2+ doping of CsPbCl3 QDs at room temperature by the introduction of the concentrated HCl acid into the precursor.95 Strong orange emission at nearly 600 nm and cubic phase structure were achieved in Mn:CsPbCl3 QDs. Isocrystalline shell growth was also used to improve the emission intensity and thermal stability of the perovskite QDs. The core–shell QDs achieved a lifetime of 1.4 ms and high thermal stability even at 110 °C. In 2017, Donega and co-workers exploited a large divalent metal cation to synthesize CsPb1−xBxBr3 (B = Sn2+, Cd2+, Zn2+) QDs by the postsynthetic cation exchange method.82 The CsPb1−xMxBr3 QDs showed a PLQY of over 60% and a FWHM of 80 meV. The partial replacement of Pb2+ caused a blue-shift in the emission wavelength because of the contraction in lattice, while maintaining the high PLQY of more than 60% (Fig. 4a and b).74 Recently, Sun et al. synthesized all-inorganic perovskite QDs with near 100% PLQY through Ni2+ ion doping. The low PLQY in un-doped QDs was ascribed to the disorder of the lattice, while the Ni+ dopant could effectively remove these defects and lead to ordered lattice (Fig. 4c).84

Niu and Tang investigated a heterovalent Bi3+ with much lower toxicity than Pb2+ and more stability than Sn2+ to synthesize the MA3Bi2Br9 QDs for the first time by a modified LARP method.85 The resulting QDs featured a size of 3 nm and PLQY reaching 12%. The PL of MA3Bi2X9 QD peaks could be adjusted from 360 nm to 540 nm via post-synthetic anion exchange. Besides, MA3Bi2Br9 QDs also exhibited much better alcohol stability than the MAPbBr3 QD analogues. Bakr and Mohammed presented Bi3+ doping of CsPbBr3 QDs via an in situ method and elaborated their function in improved charge-carrier transport by the increase of the energy difference.96 These QDs demonstrated few lattice distortions after Bi3+ doping and exhibited emission wavelength centred at 512 nm. They further investigated the mechanism for electron injection from CsPbBr3 QDs and Bi3+:CsPbBr3 QDs to the molecular acceptor-tetracyanoethylene (TCNE). Fig. 3c shows the interfacial band alignment and charge transport between perovskite QDs and TCNE.96 For the Bi3+:CsPbBr3 QD system, higher energy match was realized between the conduction band (CB) of host QDs and the lowest energy unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of acceptors, which accelerated the electron injection. Despite significant progress in lead-free MHP QDs, the main difficulties encountered to date remain the oxidative instabilities of Sn analogues, and the inability of Bi halides to form 3D frameworks.
The X-site in ABX3 is usually a halogen atom and mixtures thereof. When the size of X anions increased, the MHP QDs generated bathochromic shifts in absorption spectra. Therefore, the bandgap in perovskite QDs can be readily tuned spanning the visible spectrum, appealed in information displays and lighting applications. Specifically, higher bandgap will be obtained with the larger halide anions (rCl− = 1.81 Å, rBr− = 1.96 Å, rI− = 2.20 Å) due to their deeper bonding p-orbitals.97 Zhong and co-workers achieved the synthesis of MAPbX3 QDs for the first time by halogen ion doping at room temperature.16 Subsequently, Zeng and co-workers investigated the synthesis of all-inorganic CsPbX3 QDs.61 Kovalenko et al. further adjusted the emission spectrum covering the entire visible range by varying halogen proportion in the CsPbX3 system in 2016. The quantum yield was maintained at 20%–80%.98 Friend et al. synthesized blue-emission QDs with a mixture of chlorine and bromine atoms.99 Prato and Manna demonstrated the anion exchange routes to tune the chemical composition of CsPbX3 QDs in Fig. 5.73 The composition and structure modulation of perovskites could generally enhance the optical properties of CsPbX3 QDs and further enhance their performance in LEDs.

3.2 Size effect regulation
When one or more dimensions of the particles is restricted to be smaller than Bohr radius, strong quantum confinement effects dominate the electronic level structure and induce energy quantization.100,101 Hence, the quantum confinement effects can effectively regulate the optical properties of perovskite QDs, including the bandwidth and emission wavelength. Specifically, the energy gap grows for strongly quantum-confined systems as the size of perovskite NCs decreases. Zhao and Zhong confirmed the rule in the MAPbI3 QD system through the infinite quantum well approximation model.102 For CsPbBr3 QDs, the bandgap increased from 2.37 to 2.50 eV as the QD size decreased from 7.3 to 4.1 nm.42 As shown in Fig. 6, when the edge length of CsPbBr3 QDs was greater than the Bohr radius of 7 nm, the spectral features were similar to those of the bulk materials and the quantum confinement effects were weakened.42 Only for the small NCs with a size of ∼4 nm, the corresponding CsPbBr3 QDs can manifest a strong quantum confinement.

Moreover, investigating the kinetics and thermodynamics in the nucleation and growth process is essential to precisely regulate the perovskite NC performance. In 1940s, LaMer and co-workers proposed the mechanism of “blast nucleation”, which demonstrated that nuclei were produced simultaneously in the beginning 1–5 s, and no more new nuclei formed during the subsequent growth process. In the LaMer mechanism, perovskite QDs showed smaller critical nucleation radii at high temperature, which prevented nuclei from turning into large crystals.103 Rogach and Zhong demonstrated that the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) determined the nucleation process in the supersaturated solution (Fig. 7a and b).104 ΔG can be expressed as eqn (3), where r is the nucleus radius, Vm is the molar volume of the solution, c is the precursor concentration, c0 is the critical concentration, and σ is the specific surface energy. The monomer concentration decreased to the critical size when nucleation occurred, which was determined by the ratio of c/c0. The already formed nuclei kept growing until the concentration had decreased below the saturation threshold. (3)

Afterwards, Etgar et al. proposed a detailed kinetics model for the CsPbX3 QDs, namely the focusing and de-focusing processes in the QD size distribution as shown in Fig. 7c.105 It was reported that the size distribution of CsPbI3 QDs showed focusing in the beginning 20 seconds, ensued by de-focusing during the subsequent growth. In contrast, the CsPbBr3 QDs exhibited de-focusing size distribution all the time. To date, the nucleation and growth mechanisms of perovskite QDs are still immature and need further investigation.
3.3 Surface engineering
The surfaces of colloidal QDs play a significant role in carrier recombination processes owing to their large surface-to-volume ratio, and the surface traps lead to nonradioactive recombination and sore PL quenching.106,107 In fact, the PLQY increase of conventional Cd-based QDs has gone through a long period to seek for the appropriate surface passivation routes. Generally, surface ligands are necessary for QDs to decrease the surface nonradiative trappers as their sizes decrease within the quantum range.61 Although perovskite QDs have been proved to show a high defect tolerance,15,108–110 they are still susceptible to light, moisture, and oxygen (Fig. 8).111–114 The appropriate surface engineering methods can effectively eliminate surface defects and suppress decomposition of the perovskite QDs.

In general, perovskite QDs are capped by long alkyl OA/OLA (octylamine) molecules or carboxylic acid. Alkyl amines are commonly exploited to control the nanocrystal growth while carboxylic acids are for the nanocrystal stabilization.16 As the amine ligand amount increases, the amine chain length becomes shorter which diminishes the size of the synthesized QDs.115 The ligand interaction and surface passivation are capable of producing excitons with a long lifetime and further increasing the quantum yield of perovskite QDs.116 Although excess long surface ligands are beneficial for the stability of perovskite QDs, they hinder the charge injection in emitting layers due to the insulating nature. A fine balance needs to be set up between stability and charge transport by controlling the ligand density with a subsequent moderate purification process. Song and Zeng developed a hexane/ethyl acetate mixed solvent to purify the odd ligands in CsPbBr3 QDs and achieved a high EQE of 6.27% of the corresponding CsPbBr3 QD-based light-emitting devices after two cycles of the purification process (Fig. 9).117 Later on, Chiba and Kido exploited a butyl acetate (AcOBu) solvent to wash the excess ligands in CsPbBr3 QDs and obtained a PLQY of 42%. The light-emitting devices with the AcOBu-washed-CsPbBr3 QDs demonstrated an EQE of 8.73% and a maximum power efficiency (PE) of 31.7 lm W−1.118

Besides, other novel short surface ligand types also have been explored and applied in the synthesis of colloidal QDs. The branched molecule ligands with large steric hindrance enabled a high solvent resistance and photostability of perovskite QDs and prevented their decomposition. Specifically, Rogach et al. proposed a cage-like capping ligand with thiol-functional POSS which was used frequently as a stabilizer in common colloidal QDs and applied in the preparation of CsPbBr3 QDs. The CsPbBr3 QDs with such POSS surface treatment demonstrated a uniform size distribution and solved the poor water resistance.56 Li and Zhang introduced another branch-capping ligand, PSS-[3-(2-aminoethyl)amino]propylheptaisobutyl-substituted POSS (NH2-POSS), or (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) and obtained perovskite QDs with improved stability and tunable particle sizes in uniformity. However, the PLQYs of such QDs degraded compared to the OA-capped QDs as the straight ligands were passivated.119
Moreover, another type of didodecyl dimethylammonium sulfide (SDDA) and trioctylphosphine (TOP) was proposed to control the ligand binding motifs, and enhance the PLQYs and robustness. Bakr and Mohammed exploited the SDDA as capping ligands to passivate surface defects and synthesized the air-stable CsPbBr3 QDs.120 The corresponding QDs showed improved PLQYs from 49% to 70% and the resulting films demonstrated remarkable photostability under ambient conditions for more than 34 hours under a laser pulse. The air-stability and photostability performance of QDs could effectively prevent the surface ligands from detaching in the atmosphere and merging into large crystals, which had a significant effect on the storage of perovskite QDs. Shen et al. demonstrated CsPbI3 QDs with PLQY up to unity with the presence of TOP ligands (Fig. 10a and b).29 The TOP-capped CsPbI3 QDs were effectively passivated and retained nearly 85% PL intensity after being stored in air for a month. The enhanced robustness can be attributed to the improved crystalline quality related to the less quenching defects in TOP-CsPbI3 QDs. Besides, Colvin and Yu reported that the aged CsPbI3 QDs could recover EL to the original value, which was associated with the ion migration and surface defects repairing with the help of TOP (Fig. 10c).31

Jasieniak and co-workers reported the phase-stable CsPbI3 QDs with the alkyl phosphinic acid (bis-(2,2,4-trimethylpentyl)) (TMPPA) as a replacement.121 Alivisatos et al. proposed thiocyanate salts, such as ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) or sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN), as valid ligands in CsPbBr3 synthesis.122 The PLQY of the corresponding QDs increased to 90% with a tiny spectral shift. The structural distortion originated mainly from the narrowing down of the electron level in CsPbBr3 QDs since thiocyanate salt could repair the superfluous defect of the lead surface. Zhang et al. exploited benzylamine (BZA) and benzoic acid (BA) to synthesize MAPbBr3 QDs.123 The resulting BZA-BA-MAPbBr3 QDs were highly robust and exhibited PLQY up to 86%. It is worth noting that the BZA-BA-capped MAPbBr3 QD films demonstrated a longer lifetime and barrier-free charge transport compared with other insulating ligand-capped perovskite QDs.53
4 Perovskite quantum dot light-emitting devices
In the past decades, QD-based LEDs have gained tremendous attention due to their cost effective and energy saving properties.6,124 To date, the major display manufacturers, such as Samsung, Sony, and LG, have adopted CdSe or InP-based QD technologies in commercial wide-color-gamut displays and lighting sources with a high color-rendering index.6,9 Compared to these traditional QDs, perovskite QDs show prominent semiconductor properties, such as much superior brightness, symmetric and narrower emission bands, and engineering ability of the optical properties spanning from blue to red emission, which can be promising candidates for next-generation QD-based lighting sources and information displays in future.25,91 The solution processability and defect tolerance of perovskite QDs enable their applications in flexible and stretchable electronics.19,20
4.1 Evolution of device performance
To date, tremendous research efforts have been made to enhance the performance of perovskite QD-based LEDs.31–35,59,60,78,117,125–133 The EQE of perovskite QLEDs was gradually increased within 5 years, attributed to the advances of perovskite materials, the thorough comprehension of fundamental device physics, and device structure modulations. In this section, the representative all-type efficient light-emitting devices are reviewed.

MAPbX3 QLEDs. 
Galian and Pérez-Prieto pioneered the first perovskite QLEDs in 2014. However, the maximum luminance is lower than 1 cd m−2.13 Subsequently, Pei and Zhong introduced green light-emitting devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbBr3 QDs/TPBi/CsF/Al and improved the maximum brightness up to 2503 cd m−2, current efficiency (CE) up to 4.5 cd A−1, PE up to 3.5 lm W−1, and EQE up to 1.1%.59 Zhang and Jie proposed a facile dip-coating technique to prepare uniform films of MAPbX3 QDs.60 The resulting QLEDs exhibited maximum luminances of 2673, 2398, and 986 cd m−2, CEs of 4.01, 3.72, and 1.52 cd A−1, and EQEs of 1.38%, 1.06%, and 0.53%, respectively. Later on, Xiong and co-workers exploited the LARP technique to prepare MAPbX3 quantum dot suspension, while the device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/QDs/TPBi/Cs2CO3/Al.125 The resulting light-emitting devices exhibited an improved CE of 11.49 cd A−1, PE of 7.84 lm W−1, and an EQE of 3.8%. So far, although the perovskite QD-based light-emitting devices developed rapidly, their applications in lighting sources remain vague because of their limited efficiency.
Sargent, Xiong, and Demir reported a high efficiency LED based on colloidal MAPbBr3 QDs by realizing charge balance and suppressing the Auger recombination in low driving voltage. The device stack consisted of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/QDs/B3PYMPM:TPBi/B3PYMPM:Cs2CO3/Al.33 The devices obtained a maximum luminance of 43440 cd m−2, PE of 30.3 lm W−1, and EQE of 12.9%. This contribution presents breakthrough advancement toward the efficient perovskite QD-based LEDs and formulates a device modulation approach for future studies.


FAPbX3 QLEDs. 
Pure FAPbBr3 perovskite QDs do not produce a highly efficient solar cell owing to their large bandgap of 2.3 eV. However, FAPbBr3 is a fair choice as an emission material due to their high stability in LED applications. Lee synthesized FAPbBr3 QDs at room temperature and showed high-efficiency FAPbBr3 QD-based LEDs with a CE of 9.16 cd A−1, PE of 6.4 lm W−1, and EQE of 2.05% (Fig. 11).126 Wang, Zou and Zhong demonstrated the in situ LARP method to produce highly luminescent FAPbBr3 nanocrystals with the use of 3,3-diphenylpropylamine bromide (DPPA-Br) as a capping ligand.34 The corresponding film was uniform with the FAPbBr3 nanocrystals distributed in 5–20 nm, and the PLQY was enhanced to 78%. They adopted a stacking layered structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TFB/QDs/TPBi/LiF/Al and obtained a high-efficiency pure green LED with a maximum luminance of 13970 cd m−2, CE of 66.3 cd A−1, and EQE of 16.3%. Zhong and co-workers exploited the in situ fabrication of red emissive FA0.87Cs0.13PbI3 NCs with GBL as a solvent and fabricated PeLEDs consisting of ITO/ZnO/PEI/FA0.87Cs0.13PbI3/CBP/MoOx/Au.64 The corresponding device achieved a maximum luminance of 218 cd m−2 and a peak EQE of 15.8%.

CsPbX3 QLEDs. 
Kovalenko et al. proposed an innovative route for MHPs by designing all-inorganic CsPbX3 QDs in 2015.10 Later on, Zeng and co-workers first demonstrated the all-inorganic CsPbX3 QD-based LEDs.127 They exploited the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK/CsPbX3 QDs/TPBi/LiF/Al and obtained LEDs with luminances of 742 cd m−2, 946 cd m−2, and 528 cd m−2, and EQEs of 0.07%, 0.12%, and 0.09%, respectively. The modest device performance could be ascribed to the electrically insulating nature of oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) ligands used in the synthesis process, hindering the charge carrier injection and transport in LEDs. Choy and Rogach enhanced the hole injection efficiency through intercalating a perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) thin film between Poly-TPD and perovskite emitting layer.128 The device configuration consisted of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Poly-TPD/PFI/CsPbBr3 QDs/TPBi/LiF/Al. The device with PFI showed a device luminance of 1377 cd m−2, efficiency of the peak values with CE of 0.19 cd A−1 and EQE of 0.06%. Song and Zeng further optimized the performance of QLEDs via a wash technique to control the ligand density. In consequence, the device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Poly-TPD/QDs/TPBi/LiF/Al achieved a maximum brightness of 15185 cd m−2 and EQE of 6.27%.117 Cao, Sun, and Wang exhibited less trap state QDs via improving Br content.129 Specifically, lead oxide (PbO) and ammonium halide were exploited to enhance the quality and durability of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 QDs. The halide-rich circumstance was explored to be helpful for QDs with high quality. The Br-rich CsPbBr3 QLEDs showed the maximum luminance of 12090 cd m−2, CE of 3.1 cd A−1, and EQE of 1.194%. Chiba and Kido proposed an anion-exchange strategy to fabricate perovskite QDs from CsPbBr3 QDs by using aryl-based aniline hydroiodide (An-HI) and long alkyl-based oleylammonium iodide (OAM-I) (Fig. 12).36 The pristine CsPbBr3 QDs were synthesized by a traditional hot-injection route, and then diluted in toluene with the addition of OAM-I or An-HI. Alcohol was employed to purify the perovskite QDs by removing the excessive ligands and unreacted precursors, while AcOEt was exploited as the washing solvent to produce perovskite QDs without anion defects. The corresponding QDs were applied in highly efficient red emissive perovskite QLEDs with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Poly-TPD/QDs/TPBi/Liq/Al. The turn-on voltages were 2.8 V and 2.7 V for OAM-I and An-HI based perovskite QLEDs, while the CEs were 10.6 cd A−1, 11.6 cd A−1, PEs were 11.9 lm W−1, 12.9 lm W−1, and peak EQEs were 21.3%, 14.1%, respectively. Song and Zeng demonstrated an organic–inorganic hybrid ligand (OIHL) method to cap the surface of perovskite QDs. Several metal bromides, including ZnBr2, MnBr2, GaBr3, and InBr3, were employed to passivate the non-radiative defects in perovskite QDs.35 The added metal bromide ligands enhanced the carrier injection originating from their intrinsic high conductivity. The resulting LEDs based on the passivation of ZnBr2 and MnBr2 exhibited a maximum luminance of 100080 cd m−2, CE of 66.7 cd A−1, PE of 65.9 lm W−1 and EQE of 16.48%. Li and Shan developed an innovative technique of solution-processed LEDs based on CsPbBr3 QDs with ZnO and NiO nanoparticles as CTLs.130 The device achieved a maximum luminance of 6093.2 cd m−2, CE of 7.96 cd A−1 and EQE of 3.79%. Under a high humidity of 75% within 12 hours at a working temperature of 393 K within the heating/cooling cycles, the CsPbBr3 QD-based LEDs revealed superior operation stability even without encapsulation. This work paves an avenue for stable perovskite QD-based LEDs under ambient and even harsh conditions.

Ning and Bakr explored a postsynthesis passivation method to fabricate CsPbI3 QDs with the use of a bidentate ligand (2,2′-iminodibenzoic acid).32 After passivation, the CsPbI3 QDs showed a high PLQY close to unity and improved stability. The passivated perovskite QDs enabled a red emission LED with a maximum brightness of 748 cd m−2 and an EQE of 5.02%. Chiba and co-workers proposed an anion exchange technique to synthesize perovskite QDs from pristine CsPbBr3via aryl ammonium salts and halide-anion-containing alkyl ammonium with deep-red emission at 649 nm.131 The alkyl ammonium iodine salt-based perovskite QLEDs showed a maximum luminance of 500 cd m−2 and an EQE of 21.3%, while the aryl ammonium salt-based perovskite QLEDs exhibited a maximum luminance of 749 cd m−2 and an EQE of 14.1%. Furthermore, aryl ammonium salt-based perovskite QLEDs demonstrated improved operational stability due to the lower surface ligand density. Greenham and Tan reported highly efficient perovskite QLEDs via the introduction of a facile trimethylaluminum (TMA) vapor-based crosslink to hinder the solubility of QD films.99 Hence, the orthogonal solvents were not necessary for the subsequent charge transport layer deposition. Besides, alumina also acted as a surface passivating ligand, making TMA treatment attractive in perovskite QLEDs. The compact packing and near-complete coverage of the CsPbBr3 QDs facilitated the charge capture and caused a prominent electroluminescence yield of 5.7%. They adopted a layer stack of ITO/ZnO/CsPbX3 QDs/TFB/MoO3/Ag and obtained blue, green, orange, and red emission with maximum luminances of 8.7, 2335, 1559, and 206 cd m−2 and EQEs of 0.0074%, 0.19%, 1.4% and 5.7%, respectively.
Wang and Sun proposed a novel dual-phase CsPbBr3–CsPb2Br5 QD composite system as the emitting material in LEDs, which improved the device efficiency by reducing the exciton diffusion length and trap density.132 As a result, the device featured a maximum luminance of 3853 cd m−2, CE of 8.98 cd A−1, and EQE of 2.21%.


Mixed cation QLEDs. 
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite nanocrystals with mixed cations have exhibited significant development in photovoltaics, by exhibiting a great increase of power conversion efficiency and improved stability. Stimulated by these achievements, the mixed-cation perovskite QDs applied in LEDs were explored and are summarized here. Zhang, Chen and Sun synthesized the FA1−xCsxPbBr3 QDs and obtained the optimal performance with the composition of FA0.8Cs0.2PbBr3.79 The corresponding LEDs with layer stacking of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TFB/QDs/TPBi/LiF/Al achieved a highest brightness of 55005 cd m−2, CE of 10.09 cd A−1 and EQE of 2.80%. Chen and Sun demonstrated the synthesis of MA1−xCsxPbBr3 QDs for the first time.133 The optimized component of MA0.7Cs0.3PbBr3 QLEDs showed a maximum luminance of 24510 cd m−2, CE of 4.1 cd A−1, and EQE of 1.3%.
We summarized the detailed device characteristics of the perovskite QD-based LEDs in Table 1. Perovskite QD solutions demonstrate PLQYs approaching unity, distinguishing from the PLQYs of QD films in relation to the QLED performance. The ultrahigh PLQY of QD solution mainly relies on the surface passivation ligands. However, the insulating ligands hinder the charge injection in MHP QD films and further influence the performance of the corresponding QLEDs. A fine equilibrium need to be formed between the charge injection and surface passivation. Therefore, the effective ligand-exchange methods in this section play important roles in the improved efficiency of perovskite QLEDs. Besides, modifying device configurations, with excellent band alignment and improved radiative recombination efficiency, is the key subject in perovskite QLEDs. The energy barrier between perovskite QDs and charge transport layers (CTLs) influences the charge injection and transport efficiency of LEDs. The hole transport layer (HTL) features a wider selection; PEDOT:PSS/PVK, PEDOT:PSS/TFB, and PEDOT:PSS/Poly-TPD are introduced to solve the large barrier for charge injection and achieved well-matched energy level within the emitting layer.

4.2 Flexibility and stretchability
Conventional perovskite thin-film based LEDs have presented comparable efficiency to phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs), indicating the attractiveness of perovskites for electroluminescence devices.134,135 However, applying perovskite NCs in next-generation flexible/stretchable LEDs is still a challenge owing to their rigid nature136 and confronting the organic materials dissolving issue with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or dimethyl formamide (DMF) solvents.137,138 Perovskite quantum dots, as potential materials in the preparation of efficient perovskite LEDs, can replace the conventional perovskite NC films. Besides, perovskite QDs can be dispersed in nonpolar solvents and have exhibited improved PL properties and promising device performance.13,60,125,139 Moreover, colloidal perovskite QDs maintain functionality under tensile strains in flexible/stretchable devices.23,24
Zhong and Pei demonstrated highly flexible MAPbBr3 QD-based LEDs with a high current efficiency of 10.4 cd A−1, luminous efficiency of 8.1 lm W−1 and EQE of 2.6% at the brightness of 1000 cd m−2.23 They employed the device structure of silver nanowires–polymer composite substrate/PEDOT:PSS/PVK:TAPC/QDs/TmPyPB/CsF/Al. In this device stack, the mixed hole transport layer was introduced to effectively fulfil the appropriate energy band and improve the hole mobility, resulting in the efficient LEDs. The flexible devices had been fabricated on silver nanowires (AgNWs)/polymer substrates and fulfilled mechanical stability with bending radius up to 2.5 mm. Besides, the device can survive 1000 bending cycles under 4 mm radius with only small fluctuations in electroluminescence performance.
Recently, Sun and Pei reported the first stretchable perovskite QD-based LEDs by conforming an ultrathin flexible LED stack on a surface buckled elastomer substrate (Fig. 13).24 The device configuration consisted of ultrathin polyimide (PI)–AgNWs/PEDOT:PSS/PVK:TAPC/MAPbBr3 QDs/TPBi/CsF/Al. The maximum luminous of 3187 cd m−2 and current efficiency of up to 9.2 cd A−1 were obtained. The perovskite QD-based LEDs can retain high performance even under mechanical deformation up to 50%. The MAPbBr3 QD thin film exhibited no pinholes or cracks after 50% tensile strains. Besides, the device can survive repeated 1000 stretch–release cycles without failure. This work makes a great stride in the perovskite electronics field to fulfil the stretchable light-emitting devices.

4.3 Stability and lifetime
The rapid efficiency growth and realization of flexibility/stretchability of perovskite QLEDs has gained tremedous interest in recent decades. However, there remains tough issue, such as operation lifetime needed to be improved. To date, the state-of-the-art operational lifetime of perovskite QD-based LEDs is still far away from the commercial standard (>10000 hours); therefore, enhancing the long-term stability is significant in this area. Perovskite QDs face several challenges in practical applications, such as ligand detachment, particle aggregation, thermal effect, and anion exchange during LED fabrication.25 To circumvent these difficulties, device encapsulation and mixed cations have been considered as effective methods.55,60,140–142 Besides, inorganic transport layers also play important roles in mechanical protection and further affect the device performance. We introduce several effective routes to improve the lifetime and stability in the following sections.
At the beginning research of perovskite QLEDs, the obtained lifetime was rather low. Docampo and Costa first reported MAPbBr3 and FAPbBr3 based light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) in 2015.143 The luminance of the corresponding devices decreased within the first minutes and then remained constant with the maximum values of 1.8 and 0.8 cd m−2, as well as CEs of 0.013 and 0.005 cd A−1. The operational lifetimes can only last few hours for MAPbBr3 and FAPbBr3 QLEDs. Later on, Zhang and Jie encapsulated the MAPbBr3-based QLEDs through a cover glass slide with a UV-curing adhesive (Fig. 14a).60 The packaged QLED showed only slight degradation in 7 days, while the unpackaged device underwent nearly full degradation in open air. This was mainly because of the high sensitivity of the MAPbX3 QDs to humid conditions in unpackaged devices, which eventually led to chemical decomposition. In contrast, the packaged devices featured immunity to moisture, resulting in long-term device stability.

Mixed cation perovskite QLEDs exhibited enhanced long-term stability. Once, it was difficult to obtain stable emission from CsPbI3 QDs due to their phase transitions. Doping the A-site with a larger cation makes the production of stable red emission possible, resulting from the higher tolerance factor. Kovalenko et al. doped FA cations with a larger size to synthesize stable FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 QDs (Fig. 15a and b).55 The resulting QLED achieved an EQE of 0.12%. Mn2+-Doped CsPbBr3 QDs were also demonstrated by Liu, Zeng, and Chen to enhance the operational lifetime. The Mn2+-doped CsPbBr3 QDs could be stored in open air for 120 days with only 40% PL decrease (Fig. 15c and d).141

Inorganic metal oxides are typically charge transport layers (CTLs) in LEDs. They featured chemical stability and could function as barrier layers to present moisture and oxygen penetrating into the perovskite QD layers. Song and Zeng exploited the device configuration of ITO/NiO/CsPbBr3 QDs/ZnO/Al, and the resulting devices showed lifetime 3.5 times longer than the conventional organic CTL-based devices (Fig. 14b–d).142 Besides, the devices could tolerate high moisture by soaking in water for about 20 seconds even without encapsulation, further verifying the good water-isolation ability.
Silica coating was also considered as an effective route to protect perovskite QDs from the erosion of oxygen and hydrogen in air. Zhang et al. employed (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) as a precursor for the silica matrix and the capping agent of perovskite QDs.144 They fabricated a WLED by combining the green and red QD/silica composite films with a blue LED chip. After the WLED worked for 10 hours, the intensity of EL decreased only a little. The corresponding WLED demonstrated a reasonable stability with a half-life of 227 hours in the open air. Although tremendous research efforts have been devoted to provide water and oxygen-proof perovskite QLEDs, the progress in this direction is rather limited so far. Further investigation on the degradation mechanism, along with the development of stable perovskite QDs and CTLs are urgent issues for perovskite QLEDs.
5 Conclusion and future outlook
Perovskite materials have paved a new way as light-emitters since 2014. In addition to perovskite thin films, perovskite QDs demonstrate advantages of high radiative recombination, and provide a route to manipulate the quantum confinement effect. Facilitated by the superior optoelectronic properties of perovskite QDs, numerous studies have focused on the exploration of the composition design, synthetic method, surface engineering and physicochemical properties; while rapid enhancements of perovskite QLED efficiency have been achieved over the past decade. However, the synthesis approaches are still stuck in the laboratory, and it is difficult to achieve a mass production of controllable perovskite QDs, restricting their practical applications in QLEDs. Specifically, effective synthesis methods of blue-emission perovskite QDs are very limited. Further efforts are also necessary to improve the device efficiency and to elucidate the physical mechanisms in perovskite QLEDs. Besides, the lifetime of perovskite QLEDs remains low for commercial applications. Encapsulation technology should be further investigated, especially for the flexible and stretchable perovskite QLEDs. Moreover, stable alternative metal halide analogues consisting of environmentally friendly cations instead of lead(II) are also in demand. Despite these hurdles, the advantages of perovskite QDs, facile wavelength tuning, high color purity, cost-effectiveness, and technical compatibility, render them appealing candidates for high definition LEDs. We hope this work will accelerate new insights and further research studies to boost the development of perovskite QLEDs for information displays and solid lighting sources.
