    , Accepted 22nd November 2021First published on 22nd November 2021AbstractLead mixed-halide perovskites are promising absorption materials that are suitable for applications in tandem solar cells using existing silicon technology. Charge-carrier mobility is an important factor that affects the performance of tandem solar cells. However, a detailed understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of lead mixed-halide perovskites remains elusive. Here, we used LO (longitudinal optical) phonons and alloy scattering to the elucidate charge-carrier mobilities in the FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I1−xBrx)3 hybrid perovskite system. It was found that these scattering mechanisms provided very good quantitative agreement with the experimental results, between 11–40 cm2 V−1 s−1. Our findings provide new insights into charge transport scattering in lead mixed-halide hybrid perovskites and pave the way toward design of novel semiconductor alloys for solar cell applications.
1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have attracted much attention as photoactive materials for next-generation solar energy harvesters.1,2 This increasing interest is due to a combination of their outstanding properties, including high tolerance of structural defects3,4 and low-cost processing techniques,5–9 as well as desirable optical and transport properties. They have high absorption coefficients, tunable optical bandgaps, low recombination rates and high charge-carrier mobilities.10–12 Triggered by the development of solid-state perovskite solar cells (PSC) by Miyasaka et al. in 2009,13 the first organic–metal halide perovskite, methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3), was developed with an optical bandgap of ∼1.57 eV. It had an initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%.13 To date, the PCE values of MAPbI3-based PSCs have been improved, showing more than a five-fold increase to ∼20.4%.14 However, this material is unstable when exposed to humidity, light and oxygen, presenting a major drawback that leads to a very short useful PCE of about 100 hours.15
One of the archetypal photoactive materials, formamidinium lead iodide (CH(NH2)2PbI3 or FAPbI3) has been suggested as an alternative to MAPbI3.16–18 The replacement of an organic MA+ cation by FA+ enhanced the interaction between the organic FA cation and PbI3 sublattice. This resulted in a smaller band gap, ∼1.48 eV, and improved thermal stability.18 A PCE of ∼20% has been demonstrated in FAPbI3-based PSCs.17,18 However, FAPbI3 exists in an unstable state form, the yellow δ-phase, which presents reduced stability and charge-carrier mobility.16–18 Later, mixed-halide perovskites, such as FAPb(I1−xBrx)3, were successfully synthesized.19 This alloy system can be tuned with an optical bandgap that is between 1.5 and 2.26 eV, matching other applications in a tandem solar cell technology.20 However, FAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskites showed an amorphous film structure and reversible separation into I-rich and Br-rich regions under photo-illumination, a so-called photoinduced halide segregation.21,22 Partial substitution of FA+ with a low fraction of Cs+ has been done to form a material with a more stable crystallinity in lead mixed-halide hybrid perovskites, FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I1−xBrx)3. This was done to resolve the instability problems in FAPb(I1−xBrx)3.23,24 A broad optical bandgap, between ∼1.57 eV and 2.3 eV, can be tuned by varying the Br content. Moreover, the stability of a PCE based on this material system was greatly enhanced to more than 1000 hours.25,26 Owing to its tunable bandgap and higher material stability, a hybrid perovskite, FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3, with a 1.74 eV bandgap was integrated into the top layer of a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell.23 Based on this perovskite material, measured PCEs, between ∼25–29%, have recently been demonstrated.27–29 The PCE of the current perovskite technology, i.e. a single junction perovskite solar cell (20%)17,18,30 and a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell (29%),29 approaches the Shockley–Queisser limit of a single junction solar cell (∼33%)31 and a tandem solar cell (two cells, ∼44%),32 respectively. Thus, outstanding performance using low cost solution-based processes can stimulate research in PSCs, not only at a laboratory scale, but also commercially.
Even though there has been impressive progress in material synthesis and development of the optoelectronic properties of lead mixed-halide FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I1−xBrx)3 hybrid perovskites, an accurate description of THz mobility23,24 remains unattained. An optical pump THz probe (OPTP) has been used to measured THz charge-carrier mobility. Higher charge-carrier mobilities and longer diffusion paths, e.g., 11–40 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.8–4.4 μm, were respectively achieved. Therefore, a clear understanding of the microscopic quantum processes that affect charge-carrier mobility is crucial in this material system for next-generation photovoltaic materials. In this work, we present the current understanding of charge-carrier mobilities in FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I1−xBrx)3 hybrid perovskite thin films. Of special interest is the impact of polar optical or longitudinal optical (LO) phonons and alloy scattering on charge transport dynamics across its full alloy composition range. A polaron effect based on LO phonon scattering33,34 and alloy scattering originating from the alloy compositional disorders35,36 were proposed to describe their charge-carrier mobility results. The transport mechanism of polarons was successfully applied to describe charge-carrier mobility in both perovskite MAPbI337 and SrTiO3,38,39 as well as metal oxide TiO2.40 The alloy scattering mechanism well described charge-carrier mobility in semiconductor alloys such as AlxGa1−xN41 and Mg3.125−xYbxSb1.5Bi0.5Te0.001.42 The total charge-carrier mobility determined from both scattering mechanisms was comparable to the experimental results of THz mobility.19,24 The theoretical result was in very good agreement with the experimental measurements across the Br composition range.
2. Theoretical background
Carrier mobility is represented as μ = eτ/m* where e is the elementary charge, τ is the momentum relaxation time and m* is the effective mass of charge-carriers in which  is for an electron and  is for a hole. This was examined to investigate charge-carrier mobility. We used Matthiessen's rule to determine the total charge-carrier mobility as: μtot−1 = μLO−1 + μAL−1,(1)where μLO and μAL are the LO phonon and alloy scattering limited mobilities, respectively. This rule assumes that various scatterings operate independently of each other. If one scattering mechanism dominates, other scattering types can be ignored. In OPTP measurements, THz charge-carrier mobility is extracted from the change of THz photoconductivity,  where n0 is the initial photogenerated carrier density, ϕ is the photon-to-charge conversion quantum yield falling between 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ 1 and  is the charge-carrier mobility, which sums of both electron and hole mobilities.
LO phonon scattering was the dominant mechanism near room temperature.37,43 Due to the polar nature of perovskite materials, the interactions between charge-carrier and LO phonons can be described by the Fröhlich polaron model.44 A quasiparticle is formed by a charge-carrier coupled with an LO phonon cloud created from self-induced polarization. Thus, polaron mobility is given by:33,34 (2)Herein, mP = m*(1 + α/6) is the renormalized polaron mass. The slowly varying function, f(α), is assumed to be unity. In this transport model, the Fröhlich coupling constant (α) is a significant parameter, representing the strength of carrier-LO phonon interaction. It can be calculated as, . The resulting value is evaluated using measurable material characteristics such as the carrier effective masses, effective LO phonon energy (ELO ≡ ħωLO) and dielectric constants at static and optical frequencies (εs and ε∞).
Alloy scattering (AL) originates from a random distribution of various atoms in the same lattice site. We treat alloy scattering perturbatively and assume that charge carriers scatter by randomly positioning various atoms or alloying atoms. Its strength depends on the concentration fraction of the alloying atom (x). A simple physical model for the bulk alloy scattering contribution to mobility is given by:35,36 (3)where Ω = a3/4 is the x-dependent volume of a unit cell, a is the lattice constant, kBT is the thermal energy and U is the effective alloy scattering potential taken as a potential unit. Thus, these mobility expressions allow us to describe the THz charge-carrier mobility of FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I1−xBrx)3 films measured using an OPTP technique.24
3. Results and discussion
Theoretical results are compared with THz mobility data measured using OPTP spectroscopy for neat FAPbI3 and FAPbBr3 films,19 as well as for FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 and FA0.83Cs0.17PbBr3 films.24 We started from analysis of polaron mobility using eqn (2). It was numerically evaluated using the constant parameters ( and 45) and fitting parameters (ħωLO, εs and ε∞) listed in Table 1 to validate our transport model. Calculated results for the Fröhlich coupling constant and charge-carrier mobility, as well as the experimental results,19,24 are presented in Table 2. These calculated results were in reasonable agreement with experimental data. The results suggested that the polaronic transport model explains THz charge-carrier mobilities well in neat thin films. Moreover, the carrier effective masses between 0.2m0 and 0.4m045 yielded an accurate description in terms of mobility values and accounted for their great impact upon charge-carrier transport properties. These effective mass values are consistent with previous studies in lead halide perovskites.46,47 The fitting value parameters were in good agreement with earlier reported results. Extracted LO phonon energies are 11.5 and 16.5 meV, which are comparable to values of 11.5 and 15.3 meV measured using the photoluminescence (PL) linewidth48 and 12 and 15 meV calculated through density functional theory (DFT)49 for FAPbI3 and FAPbBr3, respectively. It was found that the extracted dielectric constants (ε∞ = 5.5, εs = 45) and (ε∞ = 4.5, εs = 43), are consistent with reported results of (ε∞ = 5.5, εs = 47) in FAPbI350,51 and (ε∞ = 4.5, εs = 43.7) in FAPbBr3,50,52 respectively. In FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 and FA0.83Cs0.17PbBr3 films, fitting parameters, (ε∞ = 5.5, εs = 45) and (ε∞ = 4.5, εs = 43), were respectively determined. These values suggested that dielectric constant values of lead bromide perovskites are smaller than those of lead iodide perovskites, which is consistent with the findings of Rehman et al.24 The extracted LO phonon mode of 15 meV agrees well with the 14 meV measured value in the experimental result derived from the PL linewidth in FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3.53

To investigate the impact of alloy (Br) concentration on the charge-carrier mobilities in FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I1−xBrx)3 hybrid perovskites, we proceeded by fitting the experimental data24 to the individual mobilities for both LO phonon and alloy scatterings. In numerical calculations, we used LO phonon energies and alloy scattering potentials (U) as the fitting parameters. The effective masses of charge carriers,45 measured lattice constants54 and dielectric constants of FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67, 0.83) listed in Table 3, were employed. Fig. 1(a) shows a comparison of fitted mobilities and the experimental data as a function of Br content. To indicate mobilities at x = 0.1 and x = 0.9, the orange and blue solid triangles in this figure are extrapolated from the fits. The effective charge-carrier mobility (orange solid triangles), μeff = μtot,e +μtot,h with total charge-carrier mobilities of μtot,e = (μLO,e−1 + μAL,e−1)−1 and μtot,h = (μLO,h−1 + μAL,h−1)−1, provided very good quantitative agreement with the THz mobility data at Br contents between x = 0.3 and x = 0.9. The fit gives the extract fitting parameters for ELO = 13 meV and U = 3 eV (or 4.806 × 10−19 V). It is suggested that the THz mobility data over the range of x = 0.3–0.9 was limited by both LO phonon and alloy scattering mechanisms. The effective charge-carrier mobility underestimated the mobility data for the I-rich films at x = 0.1 and 0.2. The pure LO phonon scattering model with ELO = 13 meV,  (the blue solid triangle at x = 0.1 and the blue solid line at x = 0.2 in Fig. 1(a)), yielded mobility values of 34 and 32 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are consistent with the experimental results of 37 and 34 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This indicated that alloy scattering is weak and the polaronic effect dominates. In Fig. 1(b), we used the charge-carrier mobility values of 34 and 33 cm2 V−1 s−1 calculated from LO phonon scattering at x = 0.1 and 0.17 (blue solid triangles) and the effective charge-carrier mobility values calculated from both LO phonon and alloy scatterings at x = 0.33–0.9 (orange solid triangles) to fit the experimental results.24 The fitted mobility relating to dominant scattering mechanisms (the red solid line) was in very good agreement with the experimental data across the full Br tuning range. The mobility value decreased from 34 cm2 V−1 s−1 at x = 0.1 to 12 cm2 V−1 s−1 at x = 0.9.

 Fig. 1  Plot of the fitted charge-carrier mobilities and experimental results24 as a function of Br content. (a) The blue solid triangles are the LO phonon scattering limited mobilities and the orange solid triangles represent the effective charge-carrier mobilities based on LO phonon and alloy scatterings. The solid and dashed lines are the fitted mobilities. (b) The red solid line is the theoretical mobility result fitted from the LO phonon scattering limited mobilities at x = 0.1 and x = 0.17 and the effective charge-carrier mobilities at x = 0.33–0.9. 
To further examine the microscopic quantum processes that affect the charge-carrier mobility of FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I1−xBrx)3 films, the alloy and LO phonon scattering limited mobilities and the effective charge-carrier mobility as a function of Br content are depicted in Fig. 2 (further details are found in Tables S1 and S2, ESI†). Fig. 2(a) shows the individual scattering mobilities related to both LO phonon and alloy scattering mechanisms and the total charge-carrier mobilities based on Matthiessen's rule for an electron and a hole. Fig. 2(b) shows the sum of both electron and hole mobilities in Fig. 2(a), related to the individual scattering mobilities and total charge-carrier mobilities. The alloy scattering limited mobility (magenta solid triangles in this figure) rapidly decreases from 229 cm2 V−1 s−1 at x = 0.17 to a minimum value of 54 cm2 V−1 s−1 at x = 0.67. Then, it increases with the Br content to 86 cm2 V−1 s−1 at x = 0.83. The alloy scattering limited mobility in eqn (3) is strongly correlated with the carrier effective masses, alloy concentration (x) and alloy scattering potential. The concentration fraction factor, x(x − 1), naturally yields a maximum carrier scattering at x = 0.5, leading to a minimum mobility value at x = 0.5.35,36 However, larger effective masses shift the minimum mobility value to higher Br contents at x = 0.67. In the alloy scattering potential, there has not been an investigation of lead mixed halide perovskites. Our fitting result delivered an extracted alloy scattering potential of 3 eV. This alloy scattering potential value is comparable to earlier reports of semiconductor alloys, such as 1.5–2.0 eV in AlxGa1−xN41 and 2.2 eV in Mg3.125−xYbxSb1.5Bi0.5Te0.001.42 Whilst, the LO phonon scattering limited mobility (blue solid triangles in Fig. 2(b)) continuously decreased with increasing Br content (also seen in the semi-logarithmic scale in the inset of Fig. 2(b)). The mobility value was reduced from 33 cm2 V−1 s−1 at x = 0.17 to 14 cm2 V−1 s−1 at x = 0.83. Hence, the decrease in charge-carrier mobility originates from the increased LO phonon scattering mechanism due to the increased Fröhlich coupling constant (details in Table 3). The LO phonon energy of 13 meV, extracted from the fitting with the mobility data of FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I1−xBrx)3, was lower than the extracted values from both FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 and FA0.83Cs0.17PbBr3 (15 meV). This result is consistent with a study of the Raman spectra of lead halide hybrid perovskites.49 The Raman spectrum of FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.6Br0.4 showed a redshift compared with the spectrum of FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3 at low frequencies (<200 cm−1).

The inset depicts the same plot on a semi-logarithmic scale. 
Our investigations provide new insights into the fundamental scattering processes in lead mixed-halide hybrid perovskites and yield basic knowledge of charge-carrier transport properties. First, the dynamic carrier-phonon interactions are described by Fröhlich electron–phonon coupling theory,44 and the charge-carrier mobility is calculated using polaron transport. The physical descriptors for polaron transport are the carrier effective mass, polaron binding energy (EPB) and Fröhlich coupling constant.55 In the effective mass of charge carriers, a large effective mass supports low mobility. Asymmetry in the electron and hole effective masses  leads to mobility differences (μe > μh). For the polaron binding energy, we use a simple expression, EPB = 0.106α2ħωLO,44,56 to estimate the binding energy in lead halide perovskites. The polaron binding energy corresponding to carrier localization depends on the Fröhlich coupling constant and LO phonon energy. Its strength is related to a larger effective mass and a strong difference between ε∞ and εs. The calculated values, 8.0–19.8 meV for electrons and 10.0–22.7 meV for holes, arise using the data listed in Table S3 (ESI†). These binding energy values are in the range of large polaron binding energies in lead halide perovskites, 12–45 meV,57–59 and are lower than the thermal energy (kBT ≈ 26 meV) at room temperature. Polaron states are delocalized at room temperature. In the Fröhlich coupling constant, the strength of carrier-LO phonon interaction represents interaction between charge carriers and LO phonons in a charge transport process, correlated with a large effective mass and a strong difference between ε∞ and εs. The increased Fröhlich coupling constant leads to increased LO phonon scattering and reduced charge-carrier mobility.
Second, the alloy scattering mechanism is due to a random distribution of various atoms in the same lattice site. Atomic level disorder produces potential energy fluctuation, or the so-called alloy scattering potential. The mobility of an alloying system is lower than that of a pure compound. In fact, a characteristic of alloy scattering is reflected in its concentration fraction factor, x(x − 1). For an identical effective mass, this factor yields a minimum mobility value at x = 0.5. This indicates that a relatively strong alloy interaction occurs at limiting Br compositions with I/Br ratios closer to 1:1. In this transport model, the effective mass of charge carriers was strongly correlated with charge-carrier mobility. The effective mass-dependent mobility is represented by the relationship, μAL ∝ m*−5/2, in comparison to the scattering of ionized impurities, μII ∝ m*−1/2, acoustic phonon scattering, μAC ∝ m*−5/2, and LO phonon scattering, μLO ∝ m*−3/2.35 Moreover, alloy scattering limited mobility provided a temperature-dependent mobility that follows a power law, μAL ∝ T−1/2, in comparison to μII ∝ T3/2, μAC ∝ T−3/2,35 and μLO ∝ T−1/2.60 Thus, alloy scattering significantly affects charge-carrier mobility and cannot be neglected in the analysis of charge transport properties in lead mixed-halide hybrid perovskites.
Finally, a basic knowledge of both transport scattering mechanisms can be used to describe the highest mobility value, 40 cm2 V−1 s−1 in a FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 film, which is 74% higher than the 27 cm2 V−1 s−1 mobility in FAPbI3. The highest charge-carrier mobility resulted from reduced LO phonon scattering with respect to FAPbI3, as well as Fröhlich coupling constants of αe = 2.25 and αh = 2.50 that were lower than αe = 2.57 and αh = 2.85 in FAPbI3. So, the presence of 17% Cs in the I-rich film not only provided high impact on crystalline quality,24 but also reduced the LO phonon scattering mechanism. The same result was observed in comparison with FAPbBr3 and FA0.83Cs0.17PbBr3 films in which polaron binding energies and Fröhlich coupling constants were lower than those of lead bromide perovskites, EPB = 19.8–22.7 meV and α = 3.37–3.78. Furthermore, comparison of the calculation results of FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 and FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I1−xBrx)3 revealed a significant impact of alloy scattering on charge-carrier transport properties. Under an increased Br content, the strength of alloy scattering rapidly increased to a maximum value at x = 0.67, and then it continuously decreased. Alloy scattering was neglected in the neat FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 film. The strength of LO phonon scattering continuously increased, producing both polaron binding energies and Fröhlich coupling constants that were greater than that of FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 (details in Table S3, ESI†).
4. Conclusions
We examined charge-carrier mobility in the FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I1−xBrx)3 hybrid perovskite system. For THz charge-carrier mobility, the theoretical results provided very good agreement with the experimental data for neat FAPbI3, FAPbBr3, FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 and FA0.83Cs0.17PbBr3 films as well as lead mixed-halide FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I1−xBrx)3 films. In their neat films, LO phonon scattering was dominant. The scattering from both LO phonons and alloy disorders were dominant mechanisms in FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I1−xBrx)3 hybrid perovskite films. These scatterings are microscopic processes that well explain the experimental mobility results, between 11–40 cm2 V−1 s−1. Thus, a small addition of Cs ions in the FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 film significantly improved the charge-carrier mobility, increasing crystallinity and reducing charge-carrier scattering. Knowledge of the charge-carrier transport dynamics is fundamental for revising strategies to develop high performance absorption materials for applications in both perovskite-perovskite and perovskite-semiconductor tandem solar cell technologies.

 	Fig. 1  Plot of the fitted charge-carrier mobilities and experimental results24 as a function of Br content. (a) The blue solid triangles are the LO phonon scattering limited mobilities and the orange solid triangles represent the effective charge-carrier mobilities based on LO phonon and alloy scatterings. The solid and dashed lines are the fitted mobilities. (b) The red solid line is the theoretical mobility result fitted from the LO phonon scattering limited mobilities at x = 0.1 and x = 0.17 and the effective charge-carrier mobilities at x = 0.33–0.9.	 

 	Fig. 2  Plot of the individual scattering mobilities and effective charge-carrier mobilities as a function of Br content. The dashed, dotted and solid lines are fitted to guide the eye. (a) The green and violet solid rectangles with dashed lines depict the alloy scattering limited mobility for an electron and a hole, and the green and violet solid rectangles with dotted lines are the LO phonon scattering limited mobility for an electron and a hole. The green and violet solid rectangles with solid lines are the total charge-carrier mobility for an electron and a hole, respectively. (b) The sum of individual scattering mobilities and total charge-carrier mobilities between an electron and a hole in (a). The orange solid triangles depict the effective charge-carrier mobility, the blue solid triangles are the LO phonon scattering limited mobility and the magenta triangles are the alloy scattering limited mobility. The inset depicts the same plot on a semi-logarithmic scale.
