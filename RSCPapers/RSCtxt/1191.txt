    , Accepted 22nd April 2021First published on 22nd April 2021AbstractWhen copper(I) halide salts react with various mono- and poly-chalcogenoether and -chalcogenone ligands, two general shapes of neutral polynuclear CuxXxEy species (E = S, Se, Te; X = Cl, Br, I; x = 2–8) are formed within the resulting 0–3D coordination materials. These polymetallic forms exhibit either globular or quasi-planar motifs, mainly closed cubane Cu4I4S4 and rhomboid Cu2X2S4, respectively, but not exclusively. Depending on the shape of these polynuclear species and the dimensionality of the network, their properties and applications are profoundly different. These materials include luminescent and electroactive materials, sensors for small molecules, thermo-, electro- and photocatalysts, therapeutic and antibacterial species, electrically conducting solids, active components in solar cells and light emitting diodes, and functional and stimuli-responsive materials (such as self-healing). Specific properties such as occurrence of solid-to-solid phase transition and thermo- and mechano-chromism have also been observed. This work summarizes these properties and applications and presents their current research directions.

1. Introduction
The early investigations of Ford and collaborators on the luminescent cubane-shaped Cu4I4L4 clusters and some related derivatives (L = N- and P-donor ligand),1 which were also concurrently expanded to hydroxo-derivatives (i.e. X = OH),2 readily motivated many other research groups to explore the design of new CuxXxLy species, notably for X = Cl, Br, I, x = 2 to 8, and 4 < y < 8. The particularly intense luminescence properties, namely for the copper iodide-based salt, were extensively exploited to design a large range of stimuli-responsive, functional and smart materials. These materials are built upon both discrete clusters and complexes (0D-) and coordination polymers (1D-, 2D-, 3D-). The CuxXx cores are often called secondary building units (SBUs) inside the coordination polymers.3–5 Indeed, the occasionally observed large emission quantum yields permitted the fabrication of light emitting diodes (OLEDs), including white OLEDs.4 The design of stimuli-responsive luminescent materials, induced by a change in temperature and pressure, is often driven by the adaptability of the skeleton of the CuxXxLy central species, often accompanied by a change in Cu⋯Cu distances. This phenomenon is well known for the Cu4I4L4 clusters where the two extreme geometries, stella quadrangular and closed cubane, have been observed by X-ray crystallography and are directly linked to their corresponding photophysical properties (Fig. 1).1 In addition to these two stimuli-driven materials, others were also reported and included light- (i.e. upon irradiation), solvato- (or vapor-), and mechano-chromic materials.4,5 In the case of coordination polymers, such changes in luminescence responses can be induced or accompanied by a solid-to-solid phase transition.4 In addition, the design of nanomaterials and composites was also performed.5

The obvious extension of the CuxXxLy-based functional materials is for L = S-donor (i.e. a thioether or a thione), Se- and Te-donor ligands. Their emergence is rather recent (Fig. 2), but nonetheless, they exhibit rich electronic, opto-electronic, redox, and mechanical properties, as their main traits are their rich emission and electrochemical activities. Hence, the design of a large brochette of new functional materials has also been recently investigated, namely during the past decade. Moreover, many cytotoxicity studies have also been reported showing a good activity. Quite remarkably, while both P- and S-donors are considered soft ligands, this similitude stops here as the resulting structures of their SBUs and the dimensionality of the coordination polymers differ quite significantly. Indeed for the P-donor ligands, the resulting SBU geometry consists largely of the closed Cu4I4P4 cubane, whereas the S-donor-containing materials exhibit quite a large spread of SBU motifs based on a recent series of structural surveys conducted by us.6–8 Several examples involving the CuI salt are provided in Fig. 3. In addition, the CuxXxPy species (X = Cl, Br, I) are overwhelmingly reported as 0D complexes, whereas the CuxXxSy species (X = Cl, Br, I) are mostly found within coordination polymers, mainly 1D- and 2D-materials.6–8 Consequently, these major differences in SBU geometries and network structures lead inevitably to significant differences in SBU-based properties in the solid state such as electric conductivity and mechanical properties for example.

This review describes and analyses the properties and applications of functional materials issued from the emerging CuxXxEy-based chemistry (X = Cl, Br, I; E = S-, Se-, Te-donor ligands; x = 2–8; 4 < y < 8). Examples of applications include small molecule sensing, thermo-, electro- and photo-catalysis, therapeutic and antibacterial activities, electrical conductivity, solar cells and light emitting diodes, and as self-healing and stimuli-responsive materials.

2.1. Formation of emissive CuxIxSy species at the CuI crystal surface
Pike et al. reported the adsorption of various small thioether and amine molecules, including Me2S (L1), Et2S (L2) and tetrahydrothiophene, THT (L3), onto γ-CuI films and examined the emission response of the surface modified materials at 298 and 77 K.9 The emission colors (Fig. 5a) and spectral data (Fig. 5b and Table 1) clearly differ depending on the thioether. The authors made a primary attempt to link the emission spectra of these modified surfaces and the observed emission properties generally encountered from neutral CuxIxSy species, namely between closed cubanes, which are often characterized by high and low energy emission bands and large Stokes shifts, and stair step polymers. Scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy of unexposed and exposed γ-CuI films indicated film thickness of approximately 1 μm and nearly continuous coverage. Comparison of the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns before and after exposure revealed a difference in the CuI surface morphology where some degree of crystallinity was lost, presumably due to recrystallization upon CuI binding. This trait readily indicates that the observed phenomenon was a surface phenomenon. Their initial interpretation was that the emissive species were different from the commonly encountered Cu4I4S4 cubane, and most likely of larger dimension, and that computer modeling was necessary to understand this phenomenon. This hypothesis is plausible because emissive CuxIxSy species may also be of various motifs different from the common Cu4I4S4 cubane as shown in Fig. 3. Subsequently, the same group indeed studied the adsorption of L1 onto CuI and CuI/AgI nanoparticles (diameter varying from 18 ± 3 to 45 ± 6 Å) and performed computational studies on cation terminated surfaces (Fig. 5c).10 The result is that Me2S (L1) was able to penetrate the surface and be embedded under a layer of CuI. The initial process involved the adsorption of L1 onto the surface, followed by displacement of the substrate atom by L1 (embedding) thus corresponding to an intermediary state (Fig. 5d), and the formation of the final species at the surface as Cu4I4(L1)3 identified by comparison of the PXRD patterns with an authentic sample.

It was also interesting to note that the process was accelerated when the nanoparticles incorporated AgI. The PXRD indicated that the lattice structure was not dramatically perturbed. However, one suspects that because of the difference in cation radii (0.91 vs. 1.29 Å), defaults in the surface steps are created thus allowing for faster embedding. This experiment offered no evidence for Ag- or AgCu-containing despite the fact that the crystal structure of the Ag–S linked complex [Ag4I4(L3)4]11,12 is known. This is consistent with the fact that these species such as Ag2I2S4 rhomboids13,14 and polymeric AgxIxSx,15 as well as their heterobimetallic hybrids,16 are extremely rare.
These basic investigations may have some impact on the understanding of the possible primary steps of heterogeneous catalysis involving CuI and thioethers, as well as those occurring in homogeneous media, such as those described below.
2.2. Solid-to-solid phase transition
The solid-to-solid phase transitions are processes that respond to changes mainly in temperature or pressure. A recent example includes the seemingly non-emissive 1D coordinated polymer [Cu2I2(CH3CN)2(L4)]n (L4 = 2-phenyl-1,3-dithiane; Fig. 6).17 The X-ray structure was investigated at different temperatures between 100 and 300 K, and between 200 and 250 K, a phase transition resulting in a change of the space group from triclinic P to monoclinic P21/m was observed. This process is accompanied by a change in Cu⋯Cu separations of 2.6731(7) and 2.7114(7) Å (200 K) to a single distance of 2.7003(6) Å. This phase transition was also confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry, DSC, in which exothermic and endothermic processes were observed at −52 °C and −58 °C, upon cooling and heating, respectively.

In a similar fashion on going from 115 to 235 K, the X-ray structure of the cubane-containing 1D coordination polymer [Cu4I4(L5)2]n (L5 = PhSCH2SPh; Fig. 6) undergoes a phase change from C2/c (115 K) to P21/c (195 K).18 The topology of the polymer does not change, except that the polymer becomes more zigzag like upon warming, but more strikingly, the process is accompanied by the loss of the 2-fold symmetry plane in the crystal (Fig. 7). The mean Cu⋯Cu separation, d(Cu⋯Cu), and the Cu4 tetrahedron volume, V(Cu4), increase monotonically with temperature, as expected, but these increases are more rapid for the high temperature phase (note that there are breaks in the lines d(Cu⋯Cu) and V(Cu4) vs. temperature whereas these breaks are not present in the graphs for other related polymers). Strikingly, there is no change in emission maxima (515 nm), and emission lifetime (τe = 1.0 and 1.2 μs) at 77 and 298 K, respectively, except for an impressive increase in bandwidth upon heating (75 vs. 120 nm).

The discrete and strongly luminescent cluster Cu4I4(L3)4 (L3 = THT = tetrahydrothiophene; Fig. 8) exhibits a triclinic phase at 25 °C (P; thermodynamic product) and a yellow emission where the Cu⋯Cu separations vary from 2.639(3) to 2.768(3) Å, which are considered normal distances.19 This phase undergoes an endothermic transformation (based on DSC measurements) to a monoclinic phase at 38 °C (P21/n; kinetic product) where the Cu⋯Cu separations vary from 2.673 to 2.837 Å. The latter exhibits an orange emission. This phase change is reversible and can be monitored by DSC (as mentioned) and emission spectroscopy, by which the thermochromism was pinned down. At least two emission maxima (high and low energy bands) were depicted, as well as two τe values (about 15 and 9 μs, respectively) at 77 K. Upon grinding the monoclinic phase, part of the sample transforms into a triclinic phase, indicating that the latter phase is the most stable phase.

2.3. Luminescent sensors
Earlier investigations reported by J. Kim and collaborators showed that the luminescence response was a convenient tool for sensing a crystal change.20 They prepared ligand L6 and upon reaction of L6 with CuI under different synthesis conditions, they obtained 1D-[Cu2I2(L6)2]n, 2D-[Cu4I4(L6)2]n, and 1D-[Cu4I4(L6)2]n, identified by X-ray methods, and a material formulated as [Cu4I4(L6)2(CH3CN)(n-C6H14)]n. A crystal transformation was noticed between the non-luminescent 1D-[Cu2I2(L6)2]n and emissive 2D-[Cu4I4(L6)2]n, where 1D-[Cu2I2(L6)2]n became 2D-[Cu4I4(L6)2]n upon heating the material (Fig. 9). This transformation was accompanied by a conversion of the rhomboid Cu2I2 SBU, which is often weakly emissive, into the luminescent closed cubane Cu4I4 SBU. This reverse reaction can occur upon adding the ligand in acetonitrile. In brief, these earlier studies showed that a drastic change in the SBU chromophore results in a sensitive change in emission properties.

In parallel, the same group prepared the calix-[4]-arene ligand L7 and by applying different synthesis temperatures, they obtained an emissive coordination polymer 1D-[(Cu2I2)2(L7)2(Cu4I4)2(L7)2]n at room temperature and a non-emissive 1D-[(Cu3I3)2(L7)2(CH3CN)2]n at −10 °C as revealed by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 10).21 Upon heating the latter coordination polymer at 175 °C, a loss of CH3CN takes place and this material becomes the luminescent 1D-[(Cu3I3)2(L7)2]n polymer. This rather subtle change in the SBU geometry also results in a drastic change in photophysical properties. The exposure of these last crystals to acetonitrile vapor, to verify reversibility, was not attempted, but nonetheless this process could also serve as the basic concept of sensing solvent vapor.

Vapochromism forms the very basis for the sensing properties of these coordination polymers. Several examples of small molecule-responsive coordination polymers built upon copper halide-thioether and -thione networks have been reported during the past few years. For example, Troyano et al. prepared a series of 1D coordination polymers from the direct reactions between L8, thiobenzamide (TBA) and CuX (X = Br, I) under room temperature conditions.22 The resulting emissive polymers were characterized by X-ray crystallography as being [CuI(L8)·solvent]n, [Cu3I3(L8)2]n and [CuBr(L8)·solvent]n (Fig. 11 and 13). The former (λemi = ∼630 and ∼635 nm; 100 K) and the latter (λemi = 610–685 nm; 100 K) coordination polymers exhibit a vapour-responsive behaviour based on their luminescence responses to vapor. At 100 K, the luminescence readily appears of various tints of red, pink and purple depending on the solvent. This solvent-responsive trait observable with the naked eyes spectroscopically translates into a difference in the emission band shape for [CuI(L8)·solvent]n (solvent = nothing, featureless; THF (tetrahydrofuran), presence of a shoulder). For [CuBr(L8)·solvent]n (at 100 K), the λemi values vary from 610 (no solvent) to 630 (THF) to 685 nm (Me2CO) (Fig. 12). These materials are also found to be semiconducting, making them multifunctional (Table 2).

Other examples include the work reported by Kim et al. in which four solvent responsive dithioether-containing 1D-coordination polymers were synthesized ({[Cu4I4L9(MeCN)2]·solvent}n; solvent = CH2Cl2 (1), CHCl3 (2), xylene (3), nothing (4); L9 = N,N′-bis[2-(cyclohexylthio)ethyl]pyromellitic diimide) when exposed to various solvent vapours.23 In these cases, the somewhat porous luminescent 1-D coordination networks are secured by bidentate ligands L (L9), which adopt either the syn-(1, 2, 3) or anti-conformation (4). The SBUs are the emissive Cu4I4 cubanes and are bonded to bidentate L9via two Cu–S bonds and two monodentate MeCN ligands. Solvent exchange is easily performed upon exposure to solvents (1 ↔ 2 ↔ 3). This process is accompanied by modest shifts of the emission band (vapochromism between ∼585 and ∼610 nm) and small structural changes. Upon heating 1–3 and in the presence of MeCN vapour, the solvent molecules leak out and L9 undergoes a syn → anti-transformation thus forming 4, which exhibits an emission maximum at ∼580 nm. Compound 4 reversibly transforms into 1–3 in the syn-conformation upon exposure to their initial solvent vapours (Fig. 14).

A modern application to sensors was recently put forward by Liu et al. for the detection of antibiotics in the environment.24 The reaction of CuI with 3-ethyl-1,3-benzothiazole-2-thione (EBT (L10)) under solvothermal conditions generates light green single crystals, which turned out to be a 3D coordination polymer of the formula [Cu4I4(L10)5]n as identified by X-ray diffraction methods (Fig. 15a and b). [Cu4I4(L10)5] in the solid state exhibits an absorption maximum in the vicinity of 400 nm and photoluminescence in the yellow-green region (λemi = ∼550 nm) exhibiting an emission lifetime of 9.13 μs. The presence of an ethyl group suggests enhancement of its hydrophobicity, making it insoluble and consequently promoting its stability in water. Indeed, this material exhibits excellent stability when soaked in water and a good emission intensity appearing as a suitable material for outdoor applications. The preparation of pellets proved easy and the cycling tests, by soaking in water and then drying in air, demonstrated its stability upon monitoring the PXRD patterns. Eight common antibiotics were examined in aqueous solutions, which included tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH), tetracycline (TC), chloramphenicol (CMP), amoxicillin (AMX), ampicillin (AMP), ciprofloxacin (CIP), ronidazole (RDZ), and sulfamethazine (SMA), and some common organics. In all cases, emission quenching occurred at mM concentrations of antibiotics, even observable with the naked eyes. Upon monitoring the emission intensity vs. the concentration of the antibiotics, Stern–Volmer analyses permitted comparison of their quenching efficiencies. For the antibiotics, the trend is TCH > TC > CMP > AMX > AMP > CIP > RDZ > SMA. TCH turned out to exhibit the highest quenching efficiency, which is about 6 times larger than the efficiency of other antibiotics. The detection limit was evaluated to be ∼4.8 ppm (10 mM). The mechanism was addressed (i.e. static quenching vs. dynamic quenching) and the perfect match between the emission decay of solutions containing [Cu4I4(L10)5]n alone and [Cu4I4(L10)5]n with THC provided evidence for static quenching. The presence of the unsaturated site for anchoring antibiotic molecules, most presumably at the surface of the particles, must play a key role prior to quenching. The nature of the emission quenching is yet to be formally elucidated (i.e. electron transfer vs. energy transfer), but the authors favored the former.

2.4. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)
One of the key strategies in designing MOFs is the use of rigid organic ligands. Indeed, 2,11-dithia[3.3]paracyclophane (dtpcp (L11)) falls into this category. Munakata et al. prepared two isostructural porous 3D frameworks of the general formula {[CuX(L11)]·MeCN}n (X = Br, I) identified by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 16).25 The SBU motif consists of zigzag (Cu–X–Cu–X)n chains (X = Br, I). The frameworks exhibit elliptical channels along the a-axis, in which MeCN guest molecules are found. Although these materials clearly fall into the category of MOFs, no BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) analysis was performed. However, the reversible adsorption and desorption of guest MeCN molecules occurred without the collapse of the 3D framework as confirmed by PXRD and 1H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy. Moreover, the porous {[CuI(L11)]·guest}n coordination polymer exhibits selectivity in polarity and size for small molecule inclusion. The favorable guests for inclusion are methanol, dichloromethane, acetone, dimethylether, trichloromethane, ethanol and 1-propanol. The absence of an analytical signal such as luminescence (which is common for SBU motifs of the type (Cu–X–Cu–X)n) or conductivity predictably precluded the design of small molecule sensors in this case.

Concurrently Xu et al. used a clever approach to construct porous and robust frameworks using a linear tribenzene dicarboxylate organic ligand (L12 = −O2C–C6H4–C6H2R2–C6H4–CO2−) containing thioether scaffolding functions (R = SMe) as pre-programmable anchors to attach metallic centers (i.e. template).26 In this case, a soft metal component (here CuI), that they call soft imprinting, was incorporated. Indeed, the synthesis involves reacting HO2C–C6H4–C6H2(SMe)2–C6H4–CO2H (H2L12) with EuCl3 and CuI in a 1:1 water/MeCN mixture at 140 °C (i.e. solvothermal conditions) to produce a colorless MOF of the formula {[Eu(L12)1.5(CuI)]·H2O}n (elucidated by X-ray crystallography, Fig. 17a–c). Predictably, this MOF exhibits the distinct luminescence associated with the Eu3+ center. The structure consists of Eu3+-carboxylate columns interlinked by the ligand. Running parallel to these inorganic rods, 1D-zigzag chains of [(SMe)C6H2(SMe)2–Cu2I2–(SMe)C6H2(SMe)]n are formed which can have important consequences. First, this MOF shows an impressive tolerance to boiling water for 24 h. Moreover, upon heating the solid to 200 °C for 4 h under vacuum, the structure remained intact based on the PXRD patterns. In addition, the TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) measurements indicated minimal weight loss from the host structure up to 240 °C. This double structural solidification from the Eu3+-carboxylate rods and the 1D coordination Cu2I2-containing chain contributes to this MOF strengthening. The hydrophobicity of the long organic ligand may help to repel water molecules. BET analysis indicates that the surface area is 560 m2 g−1, with a pore volume of 0.034 cm3 g−1, corresponding to a pore diameter of 7.5 Å, which is fully consistent with the single crystal structure. The sensing properties were demonstrated upon exposing the MOF suspended in water to dissolved H2S. For example, exposing the MOF to 20 ppm (parts per million) of H2S for 30 min leads to the quenching of the red emission associated with the presence of Eu3+ ions. At 80 °C, even 1 ppm of H2S could quench the luminescence within 2 h. Although this was not formally demonstrated using, for instance, the comparison of the PXRD patterns, H2S could be suspected to dislodge Cu(I) ions to form Cu2S nanoparticles (and HI), leaving behind another MOF {[Eu(L12)1.5]}n, which was also synthesized in parallel in this investigation. The latter MOF was found to be non-luminescent. No reversibility testing was either performed or mentioned, likely diminishing the possibility to use this material for sensing H2S and small thiols and thioether molecules. Conversely, the {[Eu(L12)1.5(CuI)]·H2O}n MOF can be used to design white light LEDs (light emitting diodes) using other different lanthanide ions.

Concurrently, the ditopic ligand 5-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol (3-Hptt (L13)) reacts with CuI in diethylformamide to form the luminescent {[(Cu4I4)3(Cu6)2(L13)12]·24DEF·12H2O}n MOF (DEF = N,N-diethylformamide), which was identified by single crystal X-ray diffraction.25 The X-ray data reveal a 3D network in which two different SBUs are depicted: the common cubane Cu4I4N4 and a hexagonal Cu6S6 cluster placed in an alternate arrangement (Fig. 18). In the hexagonal Cu6S6 cluster, the ligand is in the form of a thiolate, which is quite common with thiol derivatives placed under solvothermal conditions. The different environments around the clusters create helical arrays consisting of alternating right-handed and left-handed motifs. Between these arrays are helical channels in which solvent molecules can penetrate. The total volume rendered accessible to solvent molecules calculated using PLATON27 is around 71.9% of the total volume and the solvent accessible surface area was determined to be about 2255 m2 g−1 based on Poreblazer software.28 Unfortunately, these pores could not be activated upon heating under vacuum or solvent exchange. Upon excessive heating, the structure collapses as soon as the solvent molecules are removed. Clearly, despite this interesting structure, this MOF seems to be not suited for sensing applications at this time. Conversely, this MOF exhibits a double emission: one expectedly associated with the Cu4I4N4 cubane (λemi = ∼595 nm; triplet cluster-centered, 3CC*, only visible at low temperature) and one due to the hexagonal Cu6S6 cluster (λemi = ∼845 ± 10 nm; i.e. in the near-IR (near-infrared); τe = 1.72 μs at 298 K). The latter emission was also assigned to a triplet CC* excited state despite the rather long Cu⋯Cu separation (3.21 Å). The excitation spectra indicate that these two cluster chromophores behave independently, most likely due to the long distance between the two. At 77 K, the emission decays of the Cu4I4N4 cubane and hexagonal Cu6S6 cluster are bi- (τe = 15.0 and 46.2 μs) and mono-exponential (τe = 21.3 μs), cubane and hexagonal. The bi-exponential decay behaviour is not uncommon as mentioned in the previous section, and the time scale for these excited state lifetimes is typical for such type of Cu-containing clusters.

2.5. Homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis
The use of neutral copper halide-chalcogenoether and -chalcogenone-based materials is not new for catalysis, and many examples of applications have been reported. Indeed, an earlier investigation dealt with the use of CuCl and Me2S, which together seemingly form the tetrameric [CuCl(L1)]4 cluster, a formulation based on chemical analysis, and catalyze the isomerisation of 3,4-dichloro-1-butene to 1,4-dichloro-2-butene in solution, as monitored by UV-vis and electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.29 Note that the structure of this species has not been demonstrated by X-ray diffraction or any other physical techniques. Evidence for copper(II) species was made, despite the fact that the CuCl2-analogue was found to be much poorer as a catalyst. Interestingly, one of the main conclusions was that this species containing L1 exhibits higher catalytic activity than the (n-heptyl)2S thioether analogue. Subsequently, a cubane [CuCl(L2)]4 cluster, a structure based on chemical analysis and spectroscopy, was also studied by the same group and it showed similar catalytic activities towards this isomerisation and exhibited similar catalytical activity as the Me2S analogue.30 Mixed valence species were again suspected to be the active catalyst, making the tetranuclear clusters act as pre-catalysts. Subsequently, further kinetic and spectroscopic studies, notably UV-Vis (ultraviolet-visible), IR (infrared), EPR, and 1H NMR, suggested the formation of a polynuclear intermediate containing both Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions prior to the electron transfer step in the reaction mechanism.31 Moreover, the EPR spectra of these mixed-valent pre-catalysts indicated the presence of five-coordinated Cu(II) metals with a trigonal-bipyramidal coordination sphere.
Recently, CuX-based catalysts (X = I, Br, Cl) were investigated.32 This investigation focussed on the use of a polydentate ligand 1,2-bis(3,5-dimethyloxazol-4-ylmethylthio)ethane (L14), which upon complexation with CuX forms a series of dinuclear complexes formulated as Cu2X2(L14). As all attempts to obtain crystals for X-ray studies stubbornly failed, the structure was proposed on the basis of elemental analysis, IR spectra, and optimized geometry calculations, in which the ligand is bonded through the sulfur atoms (Fig. 19). However, this does not preclude the possibility of the formation of a coordination polymer in the solid state as the ligand exhibits two free imine sites and a Cu(I) somewhat distorted from the ideal triangular planar geometry in the optimized geometry. Nevertheless, these complexes or coordination polymers ([Cu]) exhibited high catalytic activity in the aminomethylation of phenylacetylene (Fig. 19), notably with N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylmethane-diamine, bis(oxazolidin-3-yl)methane, and benzaldehyde-piperidine systems (T = 60 °C). These catalysts exhibited similar catalytic activity as CuCl alone towards N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylmethanediamine but the Cu2I2(L14) catalyst turned out to be sensibly superior in selectivity with a 99.8% composition at the end of the reaction (99% conversion). Conversely, the Cu2Cl2(L14) catalyst was the best for the conversion of bis(oxazolidin-3-yl)methane (100% composition). The proposed mechanism included the coordination of the acetenyl function onto the tricoordinated Cu(I) centers, which activates the C–H bond. This step is followed by a nucleophilic attack onto the α-carbon of the amine, which contains a labile proton.

Another ditopic ligand, bis(2-(benzylthio)ethyl)amine ((benzyl-S-CH2CH2)2NH), was reacted with Cu(ClO4)2 in the presence of KI resulting in the formation of a Cu(I)-containing coordination polymer formulated as [Cu2I2(L15)]n and revealed by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 20).33 This 1D polymeric species includes a 1D-(Cu2I2–Cu2I2)n central motif supported by the tridentate ligand through both Cu–S and Cu–N bonds, in which one S- and the N-atoms chelate one Cu(I) metal, whereas the other S-donor bridges the next unit. All Cu(I) metals are tetracoordinated. This [Cu2I2(L15)]n coordination polymer catalytically actives a copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition in a three-component click reaction (also known as atom-efficient 1,3-dipolar Huisgen cycloaddition reaction) of benzyl chloride, sodium azide, and phenylacetylene in a H2O/MeCN mixture yielding 1-benzyl-4-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole. The resulting yields were good (72–87%, isolated) at 298 K, for periods varying from 1 to 24 h and using 0.5 to 5 mol% loading, even in the absence of a base or a reducing agent.

Another investigation focussing on one pot three-component click reactions was reported about the same time and involved the use of the 1D coordination polymer [Cu2I2(L16)2]n.34 This coordination polymer is obtained from the direct reaction of CuI with the ligand in a 1:2 metal to ligand ratio and was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR and X-ray methods (Fig. 21). The polymer consists of a wide ladder-shaped coordination structure where the bridging ligands coordinate Cu2I2 rhomboids as the steps. The 1,3-dipolar Huisgen cycloaddition reactions involved benzyl bromide, sodium azide, and phenylacetylene, and proceeded in various solvents (neat, MeOH, MeCN, H2O, H2O/MeCN (1:1 mixture)) in the presence of 0.1 to 5.0 mol% of catalyst at 50 or 60 °C for periods ranging from 0.5 to 8 h. The yield varied from 65 to 97%, but half of the entries reached more than 90%. The extension of this procedure to other acetynyl derivatives and organohalides in H2O/MeCN (1:1 mixture) at 50 °C mostly for 3 to 4 h in the presence of 0.1 mol% of catalyst provided similar performances. A mechanism was proposed involving the formation of an anionic 5-coordinate Cu(I) intermediate (i.e. a 20-electron complex).

The same group extended afterward this chemistry to the 1-(1-{4-chlorophenylthio}propan-2-ylthio)-4-chlorobenzene ligand (L17).35 Indeed, after preparing the 2D layered [Cu2I2(L17)2]n polymer from the direct reaction of CuI with the ligand, the resulting material was identified by X-ray techniques (Fig. 22). The new material consists of a 2D network polymer somewhat reminiscent of the 1D coordination polymer described above. The difference is that the 2D sheets are likely formed because the C2-chain may favor the anti-conformation, whereas the C3-chain is likely prone to favor the syn-conformation, thus placing the S-atom in positions for the fabrication of a 2D network. This coordination polymer is also suitable as a catalyst for a solvent-free, one-pot, 3-component coupling reaction involving various aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, terminal alkynes and aliphatic cyclic secondary amines (called an A3 reaction) in order to synthesize a large series of propargylamine derivatives (Fig. 23). The authors proposed a mechanism in which the 4-cooridnated intermediate “(∼S)(R–CC−)Cu(μ-I)2Cu(S∼)2” releases the R–CC− nucleophile, which attacks the iminium ion formed by the aldehyde and amine.

 Fig. 23  Reaction scheme for the A3 reaction and the optimum experimental conditions. 
The use of selenide- and telluride-containing coordination polymers and a cluster for catalytic purposes was also made.36 Indeed, Jing et al. prepared four ferrocenylchalcogenoether ligands (FcTeTeFc (L18), FcTeCH2TeFc (L19), FcSeCH2SeFc (L20) and FcSeCH2C6H4CH2SeFc (L21); Fc = ferrocenyl) and six novel copper(I) halide-based materials. The latter species were successfully characterized by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 24). The 1D coordination polymers have a structure reminiscent of the ladder-type skeleton shown in Fig. 21. The catalytic activities of these coordination polymers and a cluster were then investigated in the Ullmann C–N cross-coupling reaction between imidazole and iodobenzene under different conditions (Fig. 25). The best performances were found for 0D [Cu4I4(L18)2(MeCN)2] and 1D [Cu2I2(L19)2]n in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) at 110 °C using 10 mol% loading and KOH as a base. The observed conversions based on gas chromatography analysis were 87.3 and 91.3%. The mechanism was not specifically addressed but the authors stated that a low steric environment around the Cu(I) center in the Cu2I2 rhomboid may be a critical condition during the catalytical cycle, which would allow both imidazole and iodobenzene to coordinate the metal in a stepwise fashion and effectively provide the target product.

 Fig. 25  Tested copper(I) species catalyzed C–N coupling reaction. 
In continuation with this work, the same group subsequently investigated other telluride-containing coordination polymers.37 Indeed, in addition to the 0D [Cu4I4(L18)2(MeCN)2], 1D [Cu2I2(L19)2]n, and 1D [Cu2Br2(L19)2]n materials, this recent report included three new telluride ligands (L22, L23 and L24) and five new 0–2D Cu2X2-containing species (X = Br, I). The first ligand generates 0D species [Cu2Br2(L22)2] and [Cu2I2(L22)2], which respectively exhibit bridging and chelating ligand bindings (Fig. 26), whereas the second one leads to the formation of the 2D coordination polymers [Cu2X2(L23)2]n (X = Br, I), also reminiscent of that presented in Fig. 26. Finally, the third ligand leads to the 1D coordination polymer [Cu2I2(L24)2] exhibiting the ⋯Cu2I2(μ-ligand)2Cu2I2(μ-ligand)2⋯ organisation. All eight materials at 10 mol% loadings were tested for the same Ullmann C–N cross-coupling reaction shown in Fig. 25. Interestingly, comparison of the isolated yields between conditions 110 °C, DMSO, 24 h, t-BuOLi as the base and 85 °C, poly(ethylene glycol) (i.e. PEG-400), 12 h, and t-BuOLi as the base gave results that were slightly to significantly better for the second series (80 to 99% isolated yields). The use of poly(ethylene glycol) (of low molecular weight) is viewed as a greener alternative for organic solvent and it can easily be recycled. Other imidazole substrates were also investigated, and the isolated yields were also very good (87 to 99%, here for [Cu2I2(L22)2]). The proposed stepwise mechanism, supported by spectroscopic measurements, involves a proton-coupled electron transfer from Cu(I) and a proton from imidazole resulting in the formation of a labile penta-coordinated Cu(II) and aryl radical, then followed by an effective electron transfer from the ferrocene arm to reduce Cu(II) and form the Ullmann C–N coupled product (Fig. 27). Finally, the ferrocenium unit is subsequently reduced by the I− anion.

CuX/thiourea-based catalysis has also been observed. Indeed, Roesky et al. reported the synthesis of the thiourea ligand Ar′NHC(S)NHC(O)Ar (Ar′ = 2,6-iPr2C6H3; Ar = p-t-BuC6H4 (L25)) and some of its 0D complexes of CuX salts (X = Br, I).38 Together, they formed adamantane-shaped complexes of the general formula [Cu4X4(L25)4] (X = Cl, Br) or [Cu2I2(L25)2] (Fig. 28). In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, these complexes catalyze the oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds, including 1-phenylethanol into acetophenone. At 20 °C, the conversion is rather modest (17–46%) but increases to 63–67% at 70 °C.

2.6. Photocatalysis
The application of chalcogenoether- and chalcogenone-containing halogenocopper(I) materials as photocatalysts has only recently attracted attention. The 3D [Cu4I4(L10)5]n framework (EBT = 3-ethyl-1,3-benzothiazole-2-thione (L10)) used as a sensor for antibiotics (described above24) can also be used as a promising semiconductor photocatalyst for the degradation of organics contained in water.39 This coordination network is insoluble in ethanol, acetonitrile and acetone, and is stable in water up to 24 h. Moreover, the absorption spectrum of this 3D polymer exhibits a maximum near 420 nm and expands well from 480 to 700 nm, which makes this material potentially useful for applications using visible light. The authors used rhodamine B (RhB) as a model pollutant and compared its photodegradation to that when using nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanoparticles (N-TiO2) as a photocatalyst under a 300 W xenon lamp as a simulated solar light source. Kinetic experiments under identical experimental conditions showed absence of catalytic activity in the dark or in the absence of catalyst. Conversely, in the presence of catalyst and under irradiation, the photodegradation of RhB occurs and the 3D-[Cu4I4(L10)5]n coordination polymer is found to be significantly more efficient than N-TiO2 (i.e. by a factor of three). Moreover, the process is found to be repetitive upon cycling several times. Trapping experiments using isopropanol, benzoquinone and ammonium oxalate as scavengers of hydroxide radical ˙OH, superoxide radical ˙O2−, and hole+, respectively, were performed. The last additive significantly inhibited the photocatalytic activity thus indicating that the process is dominated by the presence of holes. The authors also indicated that this coordination polymer represents the first tetranuclear Cu(I) iodine cluster used for visible-light driven photocatalytic application.
Concurrently, the use of selenoether ligands to design selenoether-containing Cu(I) nanoparticles (labelled in the text as Cu2–xSe) and composites with TiO2 was also made.40 During the synthesis of the nanoparticles, which was performed under mild conditions, intermediate molecular species were isolated and characterised by X-ray diffraction (Fig. 29). The preparation of the nanocomposites with different Cu/Ti ratios consisted in refluxing Cu(TFA)2 (TFA = trifluoroacetic acid) and t-Bu2Se (L26) in toluene in the presence of commercial TiO2 (type P25 (rutile/anatase: 85/15), average diameter = 20 nm). The powder XRD patterns indicated that the composites consisted of TiO2 as the major component. The composites could adsorb between 150 and 200 cm3 g−1 of gas at STP (standard temperature and pressure) depending on whether they are in the presence or absence of selenoether-containing Cu(I) materials. The Kubelka–Munk plots show type IV isotherms with a small hysteresis between 0.85 and 1.0 P/P0. These nanoparticles were tested for the photodegradation of formic acid in water. Expectedly, no activity was observed in the dark but upon irradiation (125 W high-pressure mercury vapor lamp and a cut off filter at λ > 350 nm with a radian flux of ∼4.1 mW cm−2), the photodegradation of formic acid was observed. The selenoether-containing Cu(I) materials showed very little activity compared to that of TiO2 alone. However, when combined as a composite nanoparticle, the activity increased sensibly for relative compositions of 0.1 and 0.3% Cu2–xSe vs. TiO2. This improved efficiency was attributed to an enhanced light absorption property and an increased number of charge-separated pairs (e−–h+). This charge transfer process is defined as thermodynamically favored since both the conduction and valence bands of the Cu2–xSe component lie above those for TiO2, thus preventing efficient recombination. The mechanism consists in the formation of superoxide radical ˙O2− and hole+. The latter species generate HCOO˙ radicals when in contact with formic acid, which then decompose into CO2. The ˙O2− radical combines with H+ to form HO2˙.

In a similar manner, another TiO2-based nanocomposite was investigated.41 The authors prepared a 1D coordination polymer of the general formula [Cu2I2(L27)2]n (L27 = 9-(3-phenylselanyl-2-phenylselanylmethylpropyl)anthracene) where the SBU is a rhomboid. In the solid state, supramolecular face-to-face anthracenyl⋯anthracenyl contacts of 3.58 Å are depicted in the crystal. The in situ construction of core–shell TiO2–[Cu2I2(L27)2]n proceeds in two steps as shown in Fig. 30. The morphology of the TiO2–[Cu2I2(L27)2]n material was assessed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy. The surfaces exhibited well-defined lattice fringes in both the TiO2 substrate and 1D-[Cu2I2(L27)2]n coordination polymer, respectively spaced by 0.32 and 0.21 nm. These values are equal to the lattice parameter in the (110) face of the anatase and the (115) face of the 1D coordination polymer. A layer of coordination polymer of ∼2.90 Å is coated on the TiO2 surface of the nanoparticles. This distance corresponds to two 1D chains with cofacial π–π anthracenyl⋯anthracenyl interactions. The photocatalytic activity of this coated hybrid TiO2 material for the reduction of Cr(VI) into Cr(III) in water was assessed using a colorimetric method (experimental conditions: monitoring λ = 540 nm; λexc > 400 nm from a metal halide lamp filtered with a 1 M NaNO2 solution, light intensity 300 mW cm−2). The uncoated mixtures of TiO2–(L27) and TiO2–[Cu2I2(L27)2]n standalone TiO2 and standalone [Cu2I2(L27)2]n did not show any significant photocatalytic activity over a period of 2.5 h. Conversely, the coated TiO2–[Cu2I2(L27)2]n material completed the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) ions into Cr(III) in 2 h, but some decrease in the conversion rate was noted after several cycles. This efficiency is due to the formation of a charge separated state upon irradiation. The excited state oxidation potential, , of [Cu2I2(L27)2]n is evaluated to be −2.6 V (vs. NHE) and the onset of the absorption spectrum, Eg, is 2.8 eV. This thermodynamics information led to the proposition of the mechanism shown in Fig. 31.

A series of ferrocenyltelluroether-containing cuprous halide clusters were also investigated as molecular photocatalysts for C–H arylation (Fig. 32) conducted under white light irradiation in air and at room temperature.42 These catalysts are shown in Fig. 33. In DMSO, the isolated yields varied from 40 to 86%, with the red-looking cluster 1 being the best. The change of solvent did not improve the yield, but rather decreased it. Using various substituted iodobenzene derivatives and using cluster 1 as the catalyst in DMSO, similar isolated yields were reported (75 to 86%). A detailed mechanism investigation suggested that the Cu(I) cluster, upon irradiation with visible light, promotes a proton-coupled electron transfer during which the electron from excited Cu(I) migrates together with the proton from benzothiazole, forming a benzothiazolate-coordinated Cu(II) intermediate species and an aryl radical (Fig. 34). Subsequently, the electron transfer from the ferrocene pendent group to the metallic Cu(II) unit releases the reactive benzothiazolate to generate the final organic product with an aryl radical.

2.7. Electroactive materials
The presence of Cu(I) centers in the coordination polymers renders these materials potentially electroactive (Cu(I) → Cu(II) + 1e−). For example, Amirnasr et al. investigated the 1D-coordination polymers [Cu2(μ-Br)2(μ-(4-NO2Ph)2(L28)]n, [Cu2(μ-I)2(μ-(4-NO2Ph)2(L28)]n, and [Cu2(μ-I)2(μ-(thio)2(L29)]n (L28 = N,N′-bis(4-nitrobenzaldimine)-1,2-bis(o-aminophenylthio)-ethane and L29 = N,N′-bis(thiophenedimine)-1,4-bis(o-aminophenylthio)xylene) (Fig. 35).43 The coordination polymers were obtained from the reaction between their corresponding ligands and CuX (X = Br, I) in solution. [Cu2(μ-I)2(μ-(4-NO2Ph)2(L28)]n and [Cu2(μ-I)2(μ-(thio)2(L29)]n were characterized by X-ray crystallography, and [Cu2(μ-Br)2(μ-(4-NO2Ph)2(L26)]n and [Cu2(μ-I)2(μ-(4-NO2Ph)2(L28)]n were assumed to be isostructural. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were obtained using DMSO as solvent and at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The CVs are characterized by two irreversible waves at +0.38 and +0.79 V ([Cu2(μ-Br)2(μ-(4-NO2Ph)2(L28)]n), +0.26 and +0.62 V ([Cu2(μ-I)2(μ-(4-NO2Ph)2(L28)]n), and +0.27 and +0.42 V vs. Ag+/AgCl ([Cu2(μ-I)2(μ-(thio)2(L29)]n), both being associated with the Cu(I)–Cu(I) ↔ Cu(II)–Cu(II) process. Because the ligands are not prone to electronic communication between the two copper centers, these waves are due to partial solvolysis (Fig. 36). The integrity of the coordination polymer changes upon dissolving it. In solution, the material splits into shorter soluble oligomers. This general fact in coordination chemistry causes uncertainties in the interpretation. On the other hand, if the coordination polymer is stabilized onto an electrode surface, the interpretation becomes unambiguous. Indeed, in the previous section (photocatalysis), the [Cu2I2(L27)2] coordination polymer (L27 = 9-naphthyl-CH2CH(CH2SePh)2) was described. This coordination polymer was immobilized onto the electrode surface and the resulting CV exhibited a single quasi-reversible oxidation wave at 1.278 V (in DMF, vs. Ag/Ag+ in 0.01 M AgNO3 in MeCN as the reference electrode).41

Electrochemical investigations of polythioether ligands in the presence of Cu(I) ions were also reported.44 Indeed, the tri- and dithioethers tris(2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenylthiomethyl)amine (L30), bis(2,4-dimethylphenylthio)methane (L31), and bis(2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenylthio)methane (L32) were studied (in CH3CN, 1 mM, the reference electrode is Fc/Fc+, scan rate = 0.1 V s−1) in the absence and presence of Cu(I) ions. The electrochemical data of the ligands alone are provided in Table 3 (all peaks are irreversible). Upon adding Cu(I) ions in the form [Cu(CH3CN)4]ClO4 (i.e. without a halide anion), the reduction peak associated with Cu(I) + 1e− ↔ Cu(0) appeared in the CVs. For L31, this peak was found at −1.07 V, which represents a 105 mV shift towards more negative potential (without the ligand this potential is −0.97 V) thus witnessing the presence of coordination with the electron rich thioether. For L30 and L32, these shifts were 202 and 14 mV, respectively, suggesting that the complex formed with L30 is more stable. Using CuI as an additive, the authors stated that the CVs became very complex in the anodic region. This observation may be associated with the formation of several ill-defined oligomers as similarly found for the 1D-coordination polymers [Cu2(μ-Br)2(μ-(4-NO2Ph)2(L28)]n, [Cu2(μ-I)2(μ-(4-NO2Ph)2(L28)]n, and [Cu2(μ-I)2(μ-(thio)2(L29)]n discussed above. However, the main conclusion of this contribution is that the thioether ligands are also prone to be redox active.

Concurrently, soluble discrete complexes are more reliably characterized, and could be used as a model for their corresponding coordination polymers. An example for this is provided by the 0D-complex [Cu2Br2(L33)2] where L33 is 1-oxa-4,7-dithiacyclononane (Fig. 37).45 This complex in CH3CN (1 mM with 0.1 M NEt4ClO4) exhibits a single quasi-reversible wave at +0.594 vs. Fc/Fc+ (ΔEp = 107 mV; scan rate = 40–160 mV s−1). The authors stated that the CV properties of this Cu complex are similar to that of the corresponding 1,4,7-trithiacyclononane complexes of Cu(I). This conclusion supports that soluble discrete models can mimic adequately the electrochemical behavior of insoluble chalcogenoether-containing Cu(I) complexes and coordination polymers.

In the category of selenone-species (Fig. 38), the rhomboid [Cu2X2]-containing complexes [Cu2X2(L34)4(CuX)2] (X = Br, I) were also investigated.46 These complexes were investigated in CH3CN (1 mM, 0.1 M (NBu4)2PO4, Ag/AgCl reference electrode reported against NHE electrode, E½ = (Eap + Ecp)/2; ap = anodic peak, cp = cathodic peak; Table 4). The particularity of these complexes is that they also bear two mononuclear CuX units. Thus unsurprisingly, two oxidation processes are depicted and their oxidation waves are found to be irreversible (Cu(I) ↔ Cu(II) + 1e−). However, specific assignments for these electrochemical processes were not provided. Conversely, the CV traces of these two complexes showed three distinct reduction waves (i.e. return waves). Two of the waves correspond to Cu2+/+ and Cu+/0 redox processes. The third reduction peak is due to I−/I2 or Br−/Br2 reduction couples as it is suspected that these halides dissociate in solution and the vacant sites are occupied by solvent molecules. In the differential pulse voltammetry experiments, both complexes exhibit two distinct reduction and oxidation peaks. These processes correspond to Cu2+/+ and their respective halogen redox processes. Overall, these complexes exhibit a single Cu2+/+ reduction peak at a potential of −452 and −365 mV, respectively for X = Br and I, despite having two different copper centers with different geometries.

In conclusion, the presence of redox activity where metal-centered (Cu(I) ↔ Cu(II) + 1e−), ligand-centered and even halide-centered processes are all possible makes the copper halide-chalcogenoether and -chalcogenone coordination polymers and networks prone for the design of electron-driven devices. A clear piece of evidence for this is the design of a light emitting diode with the MOF containing a Cu2I2-rhomboid secondary network presented above (see the section presenting several sensors).26 This MOF contains Ln3+ ions which are photo- and electroluminescent.9 The investigated Ln3+ ions are Eu, Tb, and Eu/Tb mixture in a 1:18 Ln3+/ligand ratio during the synthesis. The corresponding Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates are (0.26, 0.42), (0.31, 0.33), and (0.41, 0.22), respectively. The third framework material (i.e. Eu/Tb mixture) in this list was used to design a white-light-emitting device. The solid product synthesized with an Eu/Tb molar ratio of 1:10 exhibits a fluorescence quantum efficiency of 5.6%.
2.8. Conducting solids
The electric conducting properties of neutral copper halide-thioether and thione networks have been known since 1996 and several investigations were reported in the past few years. In 1996, Nakagawa et al. reported the synthesis and properties of the coordination polymers [Cu2Br2(L11)(MeCN)2]n and [Cu2I2(L11)2]·THF}n (L11 = 2,11-dithia[3.3]paracyclophane) including their electric conductivity upon doping with iodine.47 The structure of the former polymer consists of a 1D-chain whereas the latter coordination network exhibits a layered structure (Fig. 39). At room temperature, when doped with iodine, these coordination polymers exhibit an electric conductivity of respectively 10−5.9 and 10−5.1 S cm−1, which is in the range of electric conductivity of semi-conducting materials.

The images were reproduced using the cif files from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre; CCDC numbers: 1316860 and 1316861. 
In the category of thione-containing materials, a 1D coordination polymer was also investigated in a similar fashion in these earlier days.48 The structure of this [Cu4I4(L35)4]n coordination polymer is shown in Fig. 40 where the ligand is 4,5-ethylenedithio-1,3-dithiole-2-thione (L35). The SBU consists of a staircase Cu4I4 motif. The authors stressed on the presence of a short S⋯S distance of 3.257(2) Å. This polymer is insulating at room temperature (conductivity σ(25 °C) < 10−12 S cm−1), but upon slow exposition of I2 vapor, a partial oxidation (Cu(I) → Cu(II) + 1e−) occurs to form an orange material formulated as [Cu4I4(L35)4]Ix. The latter has been characterized by solid state IR (ν(CS) = 1477 cm−1) and UV-vis spectroscopy (λmax = 475 nm, a band extending far in the visible region). This latter band has been assigned to a metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT). Conductivity measurements of this mixed valence species indicated the presence of a semiconducting material (σ(25 °C) = 2.2 × 10−4 S cm−1). The proximity of the sulfur rich sites is seemingly responsible for this conductivity behavior. In conclusion, these earlier works used iodine to generate a mixed Cu(I)/Cu(II) valence state and if the structure exhibited adequate contacts (i.e. close enough), then the formation of a semiconducting material was found possible.

More recently, Degaldo et al. reported the preparation of a series of thiobenzamide-containing CuX-coordination polymers (X = Br, I; thiobenzamide = L8) along with various properties including conductivity.22 These luminescent coordination polymers are 1D and exhibit the formula [CuI(L8)]n, [Cu3I3(L8)2]n, and [CuBr(L8)]n (Fig. 11a, 13a and 41). The [CuI(L8)]n polymer may contain various solvent crystallization molecules in its lattice such as THF, acetone, and methanol. Besides their sensing properties towards vapors based upon changes in their luminescence intensity, these materials also exhibit semi-conductivity properties (Table 5). Based on an examination of the literature of related coordination polymers containing the Cu2I2S2 repetitive unit and Cu–S–Cu–I chains (where the S-atom is not from a thioether or a thione), the authors concluded that these σ(25 °C) values compare favorably with those of other semiconducting materials.49–51

The same research group also reported the preparation of a 2D layered polymer of general formula [Cu2I2(L36)]n (L36 = thioacetamide). This polymer can be prepared as translucent films spreading over several mm2 surfaces and exhibiting a maximum electric conductivity of 50 S cm−1.52 The synthesis was carried out at the water–air interface and the transparent film turned out to be mechanically robust and even stable with a thickness as thin as 4 nm. Using a 2:1 CuI/ligand ratio, the slow diffusion of an acetonitrile solution into diethyl ether provided crystals of suitable quality for X-ray structure determination. However, the structure was rather disordered where the position of the Cu atoms was distributed over three lattice sites also shared with the iodine atoms (Fig. 42a). The authors offered three possible structures (Fig. 42a) and suggested their coexistence in the solid. The Cu–I (2.51–2.68 Å) and Cu–S (2.31–2.41 Å) coordination bond distances were found to be normal for this type of linkages. Interestingly, the single crystals exhibited a lower conductivity of 10−4 S cm−1, but the more amorphous crystals showed conductivity reaching 10 S cm−1. The interesting structural and electric conductivity features triggered a detailed investigation of these transparent films (Fig. 42b–e). These films showed a memristive behavior at low frequencies, which is rare. The authors stressed that this combination of properties and the large availability of these two synthesis materials provides a great potential for application in the area of transparent electronics. These two investigations (ref. 22 and 52) demonstrate that even without the addition of a doping agent such as iodine, neutral copper halide-thioether and thione networks, as such, can exhibit electric conductivity.

The formation of conducting films or press pellets can also be achieved upon pyrolysis of coordination polymers, and the resulting electric properties become dependent on the nature of the initial coordination polymer. Recently, two coordination polymers of the general formula 3D [Cu6I6(L37)3]n and 2D [Cu4I4(L38)2]n (L37 = 1,4-bis(phenylthio)but-2-yne; L38 = 1,4-bis(phenylthio)butane) were prepared using a 1:2 molar ratio (ligand/copper) in acetonitrile and then investigated.53
The powder XRD pattern of the former coordination polymer did not match that of the single crystal obtained from the literature, where the SBU is a hexagonal prism (see the SBU colored in blue), polymorph 1.54 New crystals were grown from slow evaporation of an acetonitrile solution over a week. The resulting structure is shown in Fig. 43 and consists of a polymorph 2 exhibiting the same elemental analysis as polymorph 1. This new 3D network (polymorph 2) consists of a 1D staircase ladder (CuI)n SBU interconnected by L37 through the S-atoms with no interaction between the Cu atoms and the triple bonds. These two coordination frameworks do not undergo phase changes with the temperature between 173 K and room temperature. These networks are rather found to be stable up to about 180 °C, after which ligand loss is noticed in the TGA traces under air and nitrogen atmospheres. Upon thermal pyrolysis of polymorph 2 and [Cu4I4(L38)2]n at high temperature (i.e., 400 °C), composite materials are obtained. The resulting light greyish material originating from the [Cu4I4(L38)2]n coordination polymer exhibited a carbon content of 0.05% by weight and turned out rather brittle, so no conductivity measurements was carried out. Conversely, the composite of polymorph 2 contained 10.2% by weight of carbon and a significant amount of CuI in its cubic form (density = 3.58 g cm−3). No carbon diffraction was observed indicating that this phase was amorphous. Pressed pellets of this composite (of polymorph 2) under 10 bar of pressure permitted the measurements of reflectance UV-vis spectra from which the band gap was evaluated at 2.93 eV. The electrical conductivity was measured along with its Seebeck coefficient. The conductivity was found to decrease with the temperature between 75 and 250 °C and the recorded conductivity started at 0.07 S cm−1 at 75 °C and reached 0 S cm−1 at 250 °C. The Seebeck coefficients range between 543 and 1308 mV K−1 in this temperature range.

In a similar fashion, the same research group (Bai et al.) prepared another 2D polymer of the formula [Cu4I4(L39)2]n (L39 = bis(2-(cyclohexylthio)ethyl)amine).55 Its X-ray structure consists of a Z-shaped CuI–Cu2I2–CuI SBU binding all three donors of the ligand to form a 2D network and this coordination polymer is stable up to 260 °C also under an air or nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. 44). Thermolysis at 400 °C led to a robust composite (density = 4.32 g cm−3) where again cubic CuI and amorphous carbon (4.25%) are detected. The electrical conductivity measurements were carried out between 35 and 210 °C and the recorded conductivity was noted to decrease from 0.6 to 0.0 S cm−1. The Seebeck coefficients were reported to be 700–950 μV K−1 in the 25–204 °C temperature range.

Metal-containing ligands represent also an interesting variation of the chalcogene-donor ligands. In this category Okubo and collaborators investigated the neutral square planar S-metallo-ligands of the type [Cu(SCS)2] (SCS = piperidine-1-carbodithioate (L40) and hexamethylene dithiocarbamate (L41)).56 Using [Cu(L40)2] and [Cu(L41)2] in CHCl3, they reacted these species with CuI in a solvent mixture of proprionitrile/acetone. They obtained needle-shaped crystalline materials with isolated yields of 33.4 and 18.9%, respectively. X-Ray crystallography revealed the presence of zigzag 1D coordination polymers {Cu5I5[Cu(SCS)2](EtCN)}n·CHCl3 (Fig. 45). Both include a unique cluster as the SBU formulated as Cu5I5(EtCN) consisting of five tetracoordinated Cu(I) metals, five bridging I-anions, and a terminal EtCN. Using diffuse-reflection spectroscopy and MgO doping, the electronic band gap (Eg) was evaluated to be 1.11 and 1.14 eV for SCS = L40 and L41, respectively. The two polymers exhibit a semiconducting behavior, and using impedance spectroscopy, the estimated conductivity was found to be 2.19 × 10−9 S cm−1 and 3.98 × 10−9 S cm−1 for SCS = L40 and L41, respectively. The authors pointed out that the zigzag structures reveal a 1D-chain of alternating I–Cu(II)–I–Cu(II)–, with a Cu⋯I separation of 3.420(2) Å for SCS = L40, for instance. The thermal stability was tested using TGA, and the polymers started showing weight losses at 154 and 138 °C for = L40 and L41, respectively.

2.9. Dye sensitized solar cells
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were also designed using these same neutral S-metallo-ligands.57,58 These basic motifs (i.e. square planar [M(SCS)2], SCS = dithiocarbamate ligand) exhibit three main features. First, these complexes are redox active when using an appropriate metal such as Ni(II) and Cu(II). Second, the S-atoms are prone to coordinate copper halide salts allowing for the buildup of coordination polymers Third, they are intensively colored due to the presence of a low-energy charge-transfer band (SCS → metal). This feature permits absorption of light far in the visible region extending well into the near-IR (as measured by diffuse-reflection absorption spectroscopy), thus enabling them to act like a dye. For example in these two investigations, six 1D coordination polymers were prepared when copper halides (X = Br, I) were reacted with [Cu(SCS)2], where SCS = piperidine-1-carbodithioate (L40) and hexamethylene dithiocarbamate (L41),57 and with [Ni(SCS)2], where SCS = L41,58 in acetonitrile. In all cases, the structure of these polymers has the same general formula {M′2X2[M(SCS)2](CH3CN)2}n (M′ = Cu or Ni; X = Br, I) and consists of an alternating chain of [M(SCS)2] and rhomboid Cu2X2 in a zigzag fashion (Fig. 46).

The 1D-{Cu2X2[Cu(L40)2](CH3CN)2}n polymers display strong antiferromagnetic interactions (J = −20.4 cm−1 (X = Br) and J = −18.8 cm−1 (X = I)) due to the interactions between the unpaired electrons of Cu(II) centers through the rhomboid Cu2X2 units. Both solids are semiconducting exhibiting activation energies of 0.78 (X = Br) and 0.62 eV (X = I) based on impedance spectroscopy. By comparison, the 1D-{Cu2X2[Cu(L41)2](CH3CN)2}n polymers show similar properties (σ340K = 1.07 × 10−7 S cm−1, Ea = 0.56 eV (X = Br); σ340K = 2.46 × 10−7 S cm−1, Ea = 0.48 eV (X = I)).59 Conversely, the 1D-{Cu2X2[Ni(L41)2](CH3CN)2}n polymers turned out to be insulators (σ300K < 10−12 S cm−1). The latter comparison suggests that the Cu(II)⋯Cu(I) interactions play a key role in the electrical conductivity. The 1D-{Cu2X2[M(SCS)2](CH3CN)2}n polymers (M = Cu(II), Ni(II); SCS = L40, L41) were compared in a DSSC study. The polymers were mixed with TiO2 paste by grinding in a mortar and then painted on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. Under standard irradiation conditions of AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2), the performances were tested. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) is as follows: {Cu2X2[Cu(L40)2](CH3CN)2}n, 0.051 (X = Br), 0.038% (X = I);57 {Cu2X2[Cu(L41)2](CH3CN)2}n, 0.11 (X = Br), 0.11% (X = I), according to ref. 57, and 0.149 (X = Br) and 0.151% (X = I) according to ref. 58; {Cu2X2[Ni(L41)2](CH3CN)2}n, 0.034 (X = Br), 0.041% (X = I).58 The overall characteristics of the DSSCs are presented in Table 6. Overall, these PCEs appear rather modest, but the main conclusion is that the presence of Cu(II)–Cu(I) metals within the same network is reminiscent of the mixed valence species of the generally conducting materials, and consequently these materials appear prone for the design of photonic devices.

2.10. Crosslinking of organic polymers for multifunctional and smart materials
The crosslinking of organic polymers promotes the design of multifunctional and stimuli responsive materials, and the use of neutral CuX salts as crosslinking agents has been explored by Zhang and coworkers.60,61 In a first investigation, a block copolymer poly(methyl methacrylate)-b-poly(methyl thioethyl acrylate-co-butylacrylate) (PMMA-b-P(MTEA-co-BA)), in which thioether pendent groups were introduced, was prepared. Then this polymer was reacted with CuBr in acetonitrile leading to a reinforcement of the material (Fig. 47).60 The nature of the [CuBr] reticulation units inside the resulting material was not identified. However, past reviews provide a strong indication that, in the absence of steric limitation such as in these highly flexible organic polymers, the common Cu2Br2S4 rhomboid SBU is the major component of these crosslinking units in these hybrid materials.6–8 For example, the flexible EtS(CH2)4SEt ligand forms an emissive 3D coordination polymer with CuBr where the Cu2Br2S4 rhomboid motif is depicted.62 Moreover, knowing that many coordination polymers containing this particular Cu2Br2S4 rhomboid motif are often emissive,63–66 it would have been useful to examine the luminescence spectra in an attempt to corroborate this possibility. Nevertheless, the best or optimum material (based on the stress versus strain curves) was obtained when a CuBr content of 6.6% (by weight determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES)) was incorporated in the polymer samples. The resulting material was stable up to 300 °C based on TGA measurements. The crosslinking behavior was confirmed by DSC upon comparing the traces of the pure diblock polymer with that of the hybrid material. Indeed, two phase transitions occurred for the pristine organic copolymer (at −25 and 93 °C witnessing a phase separation and a Tg), but only one Tg was observed for the hybrid materials. Increasing the CuBr content for example to 10.5% rendered the material brittle. The hybrid materials with variable CuBr contents exhibit high tensile strength (up to σb = 7.5 MPa) and breaking strain (εb = 500%) but this high crosslinking density is detrimental to ductility. Because these light-colored film materials (about 0.1 mm thick) change colour rapidly from yellow to brown upon exposing them to HCl vapor (10 s) and rapidly in contact with a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution (1 min), the authors stressed on the possibility of a new type of sensor. These new materials also show self-healing ability, which can occur within 24 h when both ends are kept in contact at room temperature (Fig. 49). Although the process has not been demonstrated formally, one can anticipate that upon cut, the Cu–S bond breaks leaving behind unsaturated copper(I) atoms and thioether ligands free. When the two pieces are put back together, then recombination occurs. After that, the materials were stretchable again with approximately the same stress versus strain properties.

Subsequently, this approach was also applied to other organic polymers containing the alternating (A–B)n structure in which regularly spaced thioether functions were introduced in the main chain.61 Upon reaction with CuI (Fig. 48), two emissive hybrid materials were generated labelled as PETD-CuI (λemi = 580 nm) and PAND-CuI (λemi = 570 nm). The authors correctly pointed out that the SBU motifs formed upon coordination of CuI with thioethers are diverse with excellent size and shape variability and thus capable of adapting to various bite distances and angles. Consequently, the authors prudently did not speculate on the emissive motifs inside the hybrid materials. However, past investigations demonstrate clearly that the globular CuI–SBU motifs are far more emissive than the flat ones,6–8 and that without any geometric constraint the most probable motifs are the common closed cubane Cu4I4S4 and rhomboid Cu2I2S4 motifs, depending on the Cu-to-S ratio.6–8 Indeed, the reported spectra exhibit precisely the usual λ range and FWHM (full width at half maximum) that the emission bands for the Cu4I4S4 cubane normally have. However, the closed cubane Cu4I4S4 motif is generated when the M/L ratio is 1:1 which is more concentrated than 1:2 which often results in the Cu2I2S4-rhomboid. Because the Cu2I2S4-rhomboids are generally weak emitters (but not exclusively) and that the synthesis was performed under a small M/L ratio, the presence of rhomboid bridges cannot be ruled out in this case. These hybrid materials are found to be more stable based on TGA measurements with a temperature of degradation reaching 220 °C. This temperature is higher than that reported for the 0D-molecular Cu(I)-thioether clusters in the literature (100–160 °C). The PETD polymer exhibits a Tg at −67.8 °C and at 22.5 °C after coordination. Concurrently, the PAND polymer exhibited Tg's at 73.4 °C and 114 °C before and after complexation with CuI. The powder XRD patterns of the hybrid materials are ill-defined indicating that these polymeric species are amorphous. The shape processing of these materials is easily achievable at high temperature. They also exhibit excellent stress–strain properties. For instance, the PAND-CuI with 10% CuI content exhibits strain at break (εb) at 80% and a fracture stress (σb) at 175 kPa. These two hybrid materials exhibited self-healing when they were cut and then left in contact for a period of 72 h.

A supramolecular assembling strategy has also been proposed for the more structurally rigid poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT, with the CuCl2 salt in ethylene glycol (Fig. 49).67 In this assembly, π–π stacking is promoted in a hydrophilic environment aided by the ionic nature of CuCl2, which was probably bonded to the S-atom of the thiophene residue. The powder XRD patterns indicated that the resulting materials were amorphous, despite the presence of crystals under an optical microscope (Fig. 49a and b). Although the oxidation state of Cu(II) does not match the scope of this review, the provided experimental data in this investigation strongly suggest that the dication has been reduced to Cu(I). The drastic evidence comes from the fluorescence quenching measurements where upon increasing the amount of CuCl2, the resulting fluorescence gradually shifts to the blue side of the spectrum indicating that the π-conjugation of the polythiophene chain was cut off. This chemical process witnesses the presence of an oxidation reaction of P3HT. It is well known that CuCl2 quenches the fluorescence of organic molecules by photoinduced electron transfer,68,69 and that of conjugated polymers by both energy and electron transfer.70 For P3HT, it was demonstrated in the literature that the presence of Cu2+ does indeed break the π-conjugation length of the polymer chain and consequently result in a blue-shift in the absorption band, a process known as oxidative doping.71 In the presence of thioether residues, this redox process, Cu(II) + 1e− → Cu(I), has been observed several times where the thioether is also used as a sacrificial ligand.17,72–75 In the most two recent works, the resulting coordination polymers exhibited a full conversion of Cu(II) into Cu(I). Moreover, the supramolecular assembly proposed by the authors was not investigated by EPR spectroscopy with the aim to confirm whether a mixed valence state exists. Moreover, a library search on polythiophenes coordinated to the copper(II) ion (other than this work) turned out futile. Concurrently, several investigations showed that the soft Lewis acid copper(I) is capable of forming coordination polymers upon coordination to thiophene derivatives.76 All in all, this supramolecular concept is interesting, but research deserves to be revisited to secure the nature of the Cu atoms.

2.11. Cytotoxicity and antibacterial properties
Thione complexes of the CuX salts exhibit cytotoxic and antibacterial properties as well and several reports on the subject have recently appeared. For example, the bidentate 1,1′-(1,2-ethanediyl)bis(3-methylimidazole-2-thione) ligand (L42) reacts, through a layer diffusion process, with two equivalents of CuBr to form an air stable 2D coordination polymer formulated as [Cu2Br2(L42)]n (Fig. 50).77 This synthesis is accompanied by a parallel redox reaction forming a byproduct salt identified by X-ray structure determination as [(C10H14N4S)CuBr3]. Evidence for thione-Cu coordination was obtained by IR, fluorescence spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction data. Indeed, the ν(CS) value shifts from 516 to 508 cm−1 upon ligand coordination. Similarly, the fluorescence maximum (λmax) also shifts from 320 to 367 nm (λexc = 280 nm). This fluorescence band was suggested to arise from an intraligand ππ* excited state. The structure of the coordination polymer consists of honeycomb layers built upon 12-membered macrometallocycle and centro-symmetric Cu2Br2S4 rhomboids as SBUs interconnected by the bridging 1,1′-(1,2-ethanediyl)bis(3-methyl-imidazole-2-thione) ligand L42 in a zigzag fashion through Cu–S coordination bonds.

(b) Representation of a fragment of the coordination polymer. (c) View of a slice of 3 layers of the 2D structure. Cu, orange; Br, deep red; S, yellow; N, blue; C, grey; H, white.

In this work, model pollutants were investigated (Congo Red, Aniline Blue, Malachite Green and Victoria Blue) for their adsorption onto or inside the 2D [Cu2Br2(L42)]n coordination layers. Detailed analyses of their corresponding isotherms (i.e. Freundlich, Langmuir and Temkin) were performed and proposed adsorption mechanisms were provided. Taking advantage of the well-defined 2D structure of this coordination polymer, well organized CuO nanospheres could be prepared using the ultrasonic and calcination method. This coordination polymer is stable up to 120 °C based on TGA analysis. Between 120 and 250 °C, the weight loss is attributed to ligand elimination. In the 410–700 °C temperature range, bromide atoms escape, and subsequently the formation of CuO nanospheres occurs (at T > 700 °C). The resulting agglomerated nanospheres were 2.05 to 10.30 nm in diameter (based on TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) measurements). The identity of these nanospheres was confirmed by powder XRD and EDX (Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) spectra. This CuO material was tested for the photocatalytic degradation of the organic dye rhodamine B adsorbed inside the nanosphere in the presence of a very small amount of H2O2 (30% by weight). The photoreaction (400 < λexc < 700 nm) was monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy. The photoinduced antibacterial activity was also assessed by monitoring the half minimal inhibitory concentration and inhibitory concentration based on MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) colorimetric assay on two Gram-negative bacteria, namely, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two Gram-positive bacteria, namely, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. The resulting antimicrobial activity turned out to be good and medical applications may be possible. It is worth noting that the coordination polymer precursor alone [Cu2Br2(L42)]n has no activity towards the investigated bacteria. However, the 2D structure and its efficient absorptivity properties are two beneficial conditions for the preparation of good CuO-composites, which can be useful for photocatalytic applications.
New CuX complexes (X = Cl, Br, I) of N-substituted imidazolidine-2-thiones were recently prepared and investigated for their antimicrobial activity.78 Among these species, bi-, tetra-, and hexanuclear complexes and 1D coordination polymers ([Cu6Cl6(μ-S-L44)6], [Cu2Br2(μ-S-L43)2(κ1-S-L43)2], [Cu4I2(μ-I)2(μ-S-L43)4(κ1-S-L43)2] and [Cu(μ-I)2Cu(μ-S-L43)2]n) were prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction studies (Fig. 51). These materials were probed for their antimicrobial properties against the Gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, MTCC740, and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, and Gram negative bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae, MTCC109, Salmonella typhimurium, MTCC741, and Candida albicans, MTCC227. The [Cu6Cl6(μ-S-L44)6], [Cu2Br2(μ-S-L43)2(κ1-S-L43)2], [Cu4I2(μ-I)2(μ-S-L43)4(κ1-S-L43)2] complexes exhibit zones of inhibition and the minimum inhibitory concentration (Table 7).

Similarly, regardless of the ligand–metal ratio, the ligand N-methylbenzothiazole-2-thione (L45) reacts with the CuX salts (X = Cl, Br, I) to form the corresponding emissive [CuX(L45)2]2 complexes.79 The structure of complex [CuCl(L45)2]2 was determined by X-ray structure analysis (Fig. 52). The antibacterial activity of these complexes as well as their ability to interact with native calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) in vitro was also investigated (Table 8). For E. coli and B. subtilis, the half-minimal inhibitory concentration (IC50) follows the trend X = I > Br > Cl, and the IC50 value ranges from 22 to 29 mg mL−1 and from 23 to 27 mg mL−1, respectively. For S. aureus, the trend changed to X = Br > Cl > I and IC50 ranged from 32 to 53 mg mL−1. For X. campestris, the trend was X = Cl > l > Br and the IC50 data varied from 31 to 39 mg mL−1. Concurrently, the trend was X = Cl > Br > I and the IC50 values ranged from 57 to 62 mg mL−1 for B. cereus. In conclusion, considering the uncertainties, the binuclear species exhibit similar, and yet, significant activities against all bacteria examined, which also compare favorably to that of standard antibiotic ampicillin. Finally, all three complexes exhibit IC100's, minimum inhibitory concentrations, of 50 to 100 μg mL−1. The integrity of the CT-ds DNA was investigated using gel electrophoresis (stained with ethidium bromide). Indeed, the DNA electrophoretic mobilities showed that the [CuX(L45)2]2 complexes bind to CT-ds DNA and result in the formation of high molecular weight species which ultimately leads to the degradation of DNA.

For comparison purposes with the thione-containing complexes discussed above, mercaptant-containing species have also been investigated.80 One of the synthesized complexes was [Cu(L46)I]2 (L46 = 2-mercaptonicotinic acid; Fig. 53), which was characterized by IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Its structure was addressed by DFT computations (COSMODMSO/B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP) and consisted of a rhomboid Cu2I2 central core flanked by two 2-mercaptonicotinic acid ligands, through direct Cu(I)–S(thiolate) bonds. Its antimicrobial activity based on the IC50 measurements is as follows: (1) against Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli, 410 μg mL−1, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 500 μg mL−1, (2) against molds, Aspergillus niger, 510 μg mL−1, Penicillium citrinum, >1000 μg mL−1, and (3) against yeasts, Candida albicans, >1000 μg mL−1, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, >1000 μg mL−1. Comparison of the Escherichia coli data (410 μg mL−1) with that from the [CuI(L46)2]2 complex (22 mg mL−1; X = Cl, Br, I) strongly suggests that the thione-containing materials exhibit superior performance (both exhibit a Cu2I2 rhomboid structure).

3. The CuCN- and CuSCN-containing thioether and thione materials
The cyanide and thiocyanide are considered pseudo-halides and are included in this review for comparison purposes. There are only a few examples of neutral CuxXxEy species (E = S, Se, Te; X = pseudo-halide) reported in the literature. Excluding the presence of emission, the second observation is that functional materials have also been reported (see below), but the number of examples is proportionally scarce.
Hunter and collaborators reported what seems the only example where a coordination polymer is held together by Cu–S bonds without the contribution of the (μ2-CC)–Cu bond.81 Indeed, an anthracenyl bearing four thioether groups, 9,10-bis{[3,4-bis(methylthio)phenyl]ethynyl}anthracene L47, forms a 2D coordination polymer of the formula [(CuCN)2L47]n with CuCN where the CuCN unit forms the typical zigzag chain (Fig. 54). The zigzag chains are interlinked by L47 through Cu–S bonds. This polymer is emissive with a maximum near 614 nm.

Concerning the electron rich thiones as ligands, an earlier work reported the preparation of a 2D coordination polymer built upon 1-methylimidazoline-2-thione (L48) and CuCN of the formula [CuCN(L48)]n.82 The CuCN unit also builds the commonly encountered (CuCN)n zigzag chain flanked by two L48 ligands coordinated through Cu–S bonds forming a cyclic Cu2S2 core, and hence completing a large honeycomb-like framework (Fig. 55). This study turned out to be mainly crystallographic.

Several mixed Cu(I)/Au(I) coordination polymers built from the pseudohalide CN− and dimethylsulfide (L1) and diethylsulfide (L2) have also recently been described and characterized.83 These materials were formulated as [CuxAu(1−x)CN(L)]n (x = 0.67, 0.50; L = L1, L2). The 3D [Cu0.5Au0.5CN(L1)]n coordination polymers consist of parallel (CuCN)n zigzag chains placed in parallel layers. Then, the metals are bridged by dimethylsulfides forming a 3D network resembling a honeycomb network (Fig. 56). The [Cu0.67Au0.33CN(L)]n versions (Li = L1, L2) are found to be isostructural. Both are emissive (λemi = 420 nm for L2 and λemi = 460 nm for L1) at room temperature. When the sulfide ligands are absent from the 3D structure, the resulting [CuxAu(1−x)CN]n coordination polymer is found to be non-emissive but is found to be vapoluminescent upon exposing the materials to dimethylsulfide and diethylsulfide vapours.

Knorr, Viau and collaborators also reported a coordination polymer obtained upon reacting 2-methyl-1,3-dithiane (L49) with CuCN.17 They obtained 2D folded layered materials formulated as [(Cu(μ2-CN)(μ2-L49)]n (Fig. 57). The folded sheets consist of parallel head-to-tail [CuCNCuCN]n bridged by parallel L49 ligands. All Cu(I) centers are tetracoordinated, but the crystal is built upon two crystallographically different copper centers. This coordination polymer is seemingly non-luminescent.

The thiocyanide salt CuSCN has also been used with some thioether ligands, notably Me2S, Et2S, iPr2S and THT (L1, L2, L50 and L3 respectively), to form several coordination polymers, forming a 1D zigzag chain, 1D ladder, 1D ladder and 1D zigzag chain, respectively (Fig. 58).84,85 Functional materials built with CuSCN, such as films, are often used as a hole-transporting semiconductor. In a recent study, the treatment of CuSCN films with tetrahydrofuran or acetone led to films containing crystallites, presumably 1D coordination polymers of large dimensions passivated by the Et2S at the surface, leading to an increase in the hole mobility from 0.01 to 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1.86

In conclusion, in the light of these past investigations, the construction of globular SBUs commonly encountered with the CuX salts (X = Cl, Br, I) is clearly difficult, not to say illusive, and rather the common (CuCN)n zigzag chain as the central scaffolding of the coordination polymers has to be systematically expected. This feature represents the major difference from those of the halide counterparts.
4. Metal-containing thioether organometallic ligands
The design of metal-containing ligands is interesting as it provides a supplementary functionality of the resulting material (see sections on conducting materials and DSSCs for examples). However, in the area of chalcogenoether ligands, such endeavor is still in its infancy. In this category, one finds organometallic ligands (ferrocenyl is an obvious example). For thioether-containing ligands, the earlier works came from Juvenal et al. where they designed a series of intensively emissive (i.e. the emission quantum yields, Φe, vary from 15 to 20%) trans-platinum(II)-containing ligands bearing –C6H4–SMe end groups (Fig. 59).87,88 When reacting with CuX salts (X = Cl, Br, I), these ditopic organometallic ligands (–CC–, –SMe) bind the copper atom through the ethynyl donor preferentially. Indeed, the Cu–(η2-CC) coordination linkage is present in all coordination polymers but occasionally, both ethynyl and thioether moieties bind the copper(I) of the SBU resulting in 2D coordination polymers with L51 and 1D polymer with L52 (Fig. 60). This preference may be due to the presence of a negative charge placed on the ethynyl group.

The 2D-[(Cu4I4)L51·solvent]n coordination polymer, which contains a SBU exhibiting a step staircase geometry, is weakly porous (solvent = MeCN and PrCN, see Fig. 61 for an example of an X-ray structure), which can absorb up to 12.2 cm3 g−1 (STP) of CO2 with a surface area of 57.2 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.019 cm3 g−1 when the solvent is PrCN. The 2D-[(Cu4I4)L51·MeCN]n coordination polymer expectedly gives similar data: CO2 absorption, 16.8 cm3 g−1 (STP); surface area, 79.5 m2 g−1; pore volume, 0.027 cm3 g−1. Conversely, the rhomboid-containing 2D-[(Cu2Br2)L51]n coordination polymer is not porous as its pores are filled with uncoordinated pendent CCC6H4SMe groups (CO2 absorption, 1.6 cm3 g−1 (STP); surface area, 1.7 m2 g−1; pore volume, <0.01 cm3 g−1). The main feature of these coordination polymers is that they are emissive. For example at 298 K, λemi = 568 nm, Φe = 15% and τe = 2.08 μs for 2D-[(Cu4I4)L51·PrCN]n, and λemi = 586 nm, Φe = 16% and τe = 0.06 μs for 2D-[(Cu2Br2)L51]n, whereas the data for L51 are λemi = 476 nm, Φe = 20% and τe = 1.11 μs, in the solid state. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the 2D-[(Cu4I4)L51·solvent]n coordination polymers are solvent dependent inside the cavity. For instance, the chromaticity data are (0.43270, 0.44875) and after removing MeCN, they change to (0.42015, 0.38006) and then after reintroducing it from vapor they become (0.44754, 0.42595). The position of λemi also varies between 15 and 20 nm depending on the solvent vapor. For instance, the 2D-[(Cu4I4)L51·PrCN]n coordination polymer exhibits λemi = 568 nm, but upon removing the solvent under vacuum, the 2D-[(Cu4I4)L51]n coordination polymer exhibits λemi = 583 nm. This behaviour suggests some modest vapo- or solvatochromism. Based on DFT and TDDFT calculations, the nature of the singlet and emissive triplet excited states was addressed. The computational results indicate that it is mainly ππ* with some minor contributions of a MLCT (Cu4I4 → L51).

Although this was not directly addressed in these earlier works, the preference for Cu–(η2-CC) binding over the Cu–S coordination is explained by comparing the results obtained with L51 and L52 and CuI with those collected for the reactivity of this same salt with the related ligand MeSC6H4CCCCC6H4SMe (L53).89 The resulting non-porous emissive 2D coordination polymer is of the formula [Cu4I4(L53)3]n (λemi = 481 nm, Φe = 17% and τe = 1.52 (B = 0.0038) and 0.43 μs (B = 0.0034; B being a pre-exponential factor; nature of the excited state is triplet M/XLCT) exhibiting Cu–S coordination bonds only (Fig. 62). The difference resides in the negative charge borne by the ethynyl segment, thus rendering it a stronger Lewis base.

Ligand L51 turned out to be subject to substitution, despite the generally recognized strength of the Pt–CC bond. Indeed, treatment of L51 with CuCN provokes a CN− attack onto the Pt(II)-center thus dissociating one MeSC6H4CC−, which in turn binds the free copper(I) forming an organometallic coordination polymer formulated as [Cu(CCC6H4SMe)]n (see the 1D-staircase ribbon in Fig. 63).90 Concurrently, the newly formed Pt-containing ligand, trans-MeSC6H4CCPt(PMe3)2CN (L54), binds the Cu(I) in the zigzag CuCN chain. Notably, no Cu–S bonding was observed in these coordination polymers, stressing the favorable selectivity for the N-containing donor.

The direct reaction of L51 with the NaCN salt led to the known complex trans-Pt(PMe3)2(CN)2 and the salt [Na+–CCC6H4SMe]. Conversely, the reaction of NaCN with the trans-Pt(PMe3)2(CCC6H4SMe)Cl complex led to the formation of tritopic trans-MeSC6H4CCPt(PMe3)2CN ligand L54.91 The latter species reacts with various CuX salts (X = I, CN, SCN) and again the Cu–S bonding is not systematically observed in all three isolated coordination polymers. In the case of the CuSCN salt, an emissive layered coordination polymer formulated as [(L52)(CuSCN)]n was isolated and characterized. These two latter investigations stressed on the unexpected fragility but convenient variability of the L51 and L54 motifs hence providing facile opportunities to design and modulate new metal-containing thioether ligands.
5. Conclusion
Herein a brief outlook of the properties and applications was surveyed. Numerous physical and chemical properties have been studied and exploited, and the most notorious reported property is unambiguously the luminescence. The coordination polymers exhibiting SBUs with globular geometry are generally emissive with good intensities (i.e. quantum yields from a triplet excited state often characterized as cluster-centered, CC*) and exhibiting an emission band in the vicinity of 600 nm. Conversely, the rhomboid motif and quasi-planar motifs are less emissive as evidenced by the clear paucity of reported emission spectra and related applications.
The second interesting property is the fact that many soluble 0D-complexes and some coordination polymers as pristine thin films are electro-active. This property makes the corresponding coordination polymers suitable for the design of conducting materials and electrocatalysis. Indeed, this survey indicated that this redox activity may stem from either the metal center (Cu(I) ↔ Cu(II) + 1e−) or the ligand, and sometimes the halide, which opened the door to the formation of mixed-valent states, and upon suitable stacking in the solid state, to the design of conducting materials based upon various doping methods, including subjecting the solid to iodine and bromine vapors for example. Applications in photonic devices, such as the design of solar cells (i.e. DSSCs) and light emitting diodes, were also reported. Concurrently, homogeneous electro-catalytic transformations of some organics were also observed using 0D-complexes.
In parallel, homo- and heterogeneous thermo- and photocatalytic activities have been observed for several coordination polymers and surface-modified nanoparticles. Applications in organic synthesis, notably for the C–N bond coupling reaction, were stressed several times. Interestingly, the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in laboratory conditions was also reported, thus suggesting potential environmental applications.
Several coordination polymers exhibit solid-to-solid phase transitions induced by thermal, mechanical, and vapor treatments. These stimuli-responsive properties were readily detected by the change in their X-ray powder diffraction patterns, but occasionally these phase changes were accompanied by modification of the photophysical properties. These optical processes are respectively referred as thermo-, mechano- and vapochromism. In the last case, sensing properties were also reported.
The use of copper bromide and iodide salts as reticulation linkers in thioether-containing organic polymers led to the design of self-healing materials where the mechanical properties recovered almost completely after several hours or days upon a complete scission into two parts. This result stresses the basic property of the Cu–X and Cu–S coordination bonds, which are relatively weak and prone to break and reform easily, thus permitting the design of such functional materials. This approach of linking polymer chains through a copper salt, here CuCl2, with ethylene glycol as co-solvent, was also used to auto-assemble the conjugated polymer P3HT in order to improve the charge migration in solar cells through better chain organisation in 3D. However, the data and experimental conditions, based on the literature, suggest the reduction of the Cu(II) ions into Cu(I), thus favoring the coordination of the soft Lewis base (thiophene) with the softer Lewis acid Cu(I). Concurrently, the use of copper iodide was made to drastically change the properties of a MOF constructed with a rigid dicarboxylate organic ligand, bearing SMe side arms, and Eu3+ ions. Upon coordination of the thioethers to the rhomboid Cu2I2 units, a second column is formed, thus rendering the MOF particularly robust, even in boiling water. In addition, this MOF turns out to be electroluminescent (because of the Eu3+ ions) which can be tuned to white light emission when using a mixture of Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions. Furthermore, many studies targeting the cytotoxicity and antibacterial activities of many selone-containing complexes and coordination polymers were undertaken. The highlight is that these properties are comparable to that of other well-known efficient cytotoxic materials, and applications in cancer therapy are clearly possible. Moreover, there was clear evidence for surface functionalization of copper salt films or nanocrystals by thioether ligands. However, there is no similar investigation concerning selenoethers and telluroethers. This situation provides an opportunity to promote surface passivation and stabilization, and thus design of novel hole-transporting semiconducting materials. Finally, the design of thioether organometallic ligands has recently been made and 2D coordination polymers with copper salts were prepared and investigated. The key feature is most certainly the high intensity of the resulting emission and the presence of some porosity of the materials. The area is still in its infancy, and the design of their corresponding functional and smart materials is foreseen.
All in all, the number of reported functional materials based on CuxXxLy species (L = S-, Se-, Te-containing ligands; X = Cl, Br, I, CN, SCN) is rather large and presents a wide scope of applications. The review also implies that there is plenty of room for further developments. Among the modern studies, one finds several designs of robust and functional thin films and one can easily predict that electrochromic films can be fabricated. Moreover, the concept of pre-programming the ligands (i.e. rigid ligands that contain both hard and soft Lewis bases) to solidify MOFs is quiet appealing when bearing in mind that the synthesis of MOFs can often prove challenging. Similarly, the preparation in a controlled manner of materials containing two different SBUs exhibiting different properties is yet to be achieved. This could likely be performed by taking advantage of the difference in Cu–S, Cu–Se and Cu–Te bond strengths. Luminescent self-healing materials also offer interesting avenues but would certainly benefit from the incorporation of prefabricated motifs (for example cubane Cu4I4(SR2)4) inside the thioether-containing linear or branched organic polymers, instead of CuI. The use of siloxane as nodes to prepare luminescent or semiconducting sol–gel-type materials could also be made.92 Finally, the high cytotoxicity of many of these materials is also clearly commendable and deserves more developments.

Note that X-ray powder XRD confirms the absence of CuCl2 crystals. (c) Proposed primary supramolecular structure of P3HT in solution in the presence of CuCl2 and EG. The complexes are CuCl42− anions (suggesting that the counter cations must be [Cu(H2O)6]2+ or [Cu(EG)3]2+). (d) Fragment of the proposed coordination assembly between P3HT and CuCl2, which form 1D-poly(CuCl2) adopting a square pyramidal geometry about the Cu(II) atom. However, there is an obvious mismatch in the Cu⋯Cu and S⋯S distances, and obvious steric hindrance with the hexyl chain. Adapted with permission from RSC Adv., 2015, 5, 87723–87729.
