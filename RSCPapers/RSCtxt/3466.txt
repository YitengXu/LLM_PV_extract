    , Accepted 18th January 2017First published on 19th January 2017AbstractThe two-step sequential deposition method is widely used in the preparation of high-performance mesoscopic perovskite solar cells. However, when the conventional sequential deposition method is applied to fabricate bilayered mesostructured and planar-structured devices, inefficient conversion of PbI2 to perovskite has been a big challenge. In this work, we report a new solvent coordination and anti-solvent extraction (SCAE) strategy for preparing porous PbI2 films to rapidly convert all PbI2 into perovskite active layers in bilayered mesostructured perovskite solar cells. It is demonstrated that PbI2·DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide, coordinated solvent) intermediate complexes are not only capable of restricting the fast growth of PbI2 grains, but also capable of facilitating the formation and regulation of porous PbI2 structures during the process of anti-solvent (chlorobenzene) extraction. With the porous PbI2 template, its complete conversion time into CH3NH3PbI3 is greatly shortened to less than ten minutes from one hour for the conventional method. The best device fabricated through the SCAE process exhibits a power conversion efficiency of above 15% under AM 1.5G solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2, appreciably outperforming the device without SCAE treatment, which can be ascribed to its uniform surface morphology and more efficient carrier transfer at the interfaces. The results highlight the tunability of the PbI2 morphology via the SCAE process and its importance to highly efficient perovskite conversion, the final perovskite morphology and device performance in a sequential deposition process.
1. Introduction
Tremendous progress has been made in the field of hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells utilizing perovskite materials as the light-harvesting layer within the past few years, represented by the dramatically improved champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% in 2009 (ref. 1) to 22.1% in the present day.2 The rapid performance improvement is fundamentally due to the unique optical and electronic properties of perovskite materials, including high light absorption over a wide wavelength range from the ultraviolet to near infrared around 800 nm, high carrier mobility, long carrier-diffusion lengths, and direct band gap.3–5 Nonetheless, fabricating high-quality perovskite films, as mainly characterized by complete surface coverage, a uniform morphology, high phase purity, and large well-crystallized grains, is believed to be an essential prerequisite for achieving high PCE.6–8 Until now various approaches such as two-step sequential deposition,9 vapor-assisted deposition,10 solvent engineering,11,12 vacuum evaporation,13 and additive-assisted deposition14,15 have been developed in order to yield perovskite films for high-performance photovoltaics. Among these approaches, the two-step sequential deposition technique first reported by Mitzi and co-workers16 is currently one of the most widely used methods due to its low cost and easy operation.
The conventional sequential deposition method was initially applied to mesoscopic perovskite solar cells.9 A thin layer of PbI2 is first deposited onto thick metal oxide mesoporous layers, and then exposed to CH3NH3I (MAI) solution to convert it to CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3). In the process, the confinement of the metal oxide mesoporous structure on PbI2 facilitates the intercalation of MAI into PbI2 and thereby guarantees the efficient conversion of PbI2 to the perovskite phase. However, when the conventional sequential deposition method was adopted to fabricate planar-structured and bilayered mesostructured perovskite solar cells, the problem of inefficient conversion of PbI2 in short dipping times (from a few seconds to tens of minutes) arose, and some unconverted PbI2 consequently remained in the final perovskite film due to the (partial) lack of mesoporous metal oxide scaffolds.14,17 Although some reports18,19 indicate that an appropriate amount of PbI2 residue in the perovskite film is beneficial to device performance, the “appropriate amount” of remnant PbI2 is still undetermined, and actually very hard to control, undoubtedly affecting device reproducibility. Moreover, there are also reports20–22 that PbI2 is detrimental to device stability or acts as a double-edged sword for enhancing the photovoltaic performance. Therefore, comprehensively considering device performance, stability and reproducibility, it is desirable to achieve complete conversion of PbI2 into perovskite. However, the complete transformation of a 200–300 nm thick PbI2 film into MAPbI3 perovskite was reported to take 1–3 hours.9,16,23 Such a long dipping time of PbI2 in MAI solution not only lengthens the device fabrication period but also leads to the peeling off, dissolution and/or degradation of perovskite films in solution.20,23 To achieve fast and complete conversion of PbI2 to perovskite, several approaches have been proposed, including solvent engineering of the PbI2 solution,23,24 intramolecular exchange methods,25,26 nanostructured PbI2 film methods,27–29 interdiffusion methods,30 three-step sequential solution deposition,31 and layer-by-layer methods.32 However, annealing, additives or vacuum techniques were usually involved in these approaches, which might increase the device fabrication cost.
Here, we develop a simple and effective approach to the fast preparation of PbI2-free perovskite films for high-performance perovskite solar cells via solvent coordination and anti-solvent extraction (SCAE) based on the following considerations. On one hand, as typical polar coordination solvents that contain electronegative oxygen atoms, both N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) have been commonly used in the conventional sequential deposition method to dissolve PbI2, either individually or together.23,24,33 Due to the existence of sulfoxide oxygen, DMSO has a stronger coordination ability with PbI2 than DMF and thereby the PbI2·DMSO intermediate complex can easily form when the ratio between PbI2 and DMSO used is 1:1.23,25,27 It has been reported that the introduction of a small amount of DMSO into DMF is beneficial to improving the quality of PbI2, and results in perovskite films with better morphology and devices with higher performance.24,33 On the other hand, several kinds of perovskite anti-solvents including chlorobenzene (CB), toluene, and diethyl ether have also been introduced in the one-step deposition method to improve the morphology and surface coverage of perovskite layers via a fast deposition-crystallization procedure.11,12,34 Considering the similar insolubility of PbI2 in these anti-solvents mentioned above, we expect that the morphology of PbI2 films and even the resulting perovskite films should also be regulated by solvent coordination and anti-solvent extraction in the sequential deposition process. In the SCAE process developed here, a porous PbI2 film consisting of small PbI2 grains and the PbI2·DMSO intermediate phase is indeed formed by anti-solvent (CB) extraction of uncoordinated molecules from a wet precursor film containing coordinating solvents (DMSO and DMF). The porous PbI2 film can be converted to MAPbI3 rapidly and completely upon immersion into MAI solution at room temperature. The resulting bilayered mesostructured perovskite device exhibits a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.66% with very small hysteresis as compared to 10.6% for the reference cell without SCAE treatment. Moreover, the mechanisms for the accelerated transformation and enhanced device performance are also discussed in the work.
2. Experimental
Materials
Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TiAcAc, 75% in isopropanol), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, ≥99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ≥99.5%), anhydrous isopropanol (IPA, 99.5%), chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.9%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, >96.0%), and bistrifluoromethanesulfonimide lithium (Li-TFSI, 99.95%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; lead iodide (PbI2, 99.999%) was obtained from Shanghai MaterWin New Materials Co., Ltd.; CH3NH3I (MAI) was synthesized in our lab according to the previous report.11 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) and a gold electrode (99.999%) were ordered from Luminescence Technology Corp. and Zhongnuo Advanced Material Technology Co. Ltd., respectively. All the chemicals and reagents were used as received without any further purification.
Device fabrication
Devices were fabricated on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates (sheet resistance: 7 ± 1 Ω □−1). The FTO substrates were cleaned sequentially by ultrasonication in detergent, de-ionized water, acetone, and ethanol for 15 min, respectively. The substrates were blown dry with nitrogen and exposed to ultraviolet (UV)/ozone radiation for 15 min before TiO2 deposition. An around 50-nm thick TiO2 blocking layer was deposited onto the FTO substrate by spin-coating a TiAcAc solution in n-butyl alcohol (0.15 mol L−1) and baking at 125 °C for 10 min in air. An around 150-nm thick mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited on top of the TiO2 blocking layer by spin-coating a TiO2 paste (Dyesol, 18NRT) diluted in ethanol (1:7, weight ratio). After baking at 125 °C for 10 min, the TiO2 films were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min to remove the organic components and improve the crystallization quality. Then, the substrates were transferred into a N2-filled glovebox with oxygen and water levels less than 10 and 0.1 ppm, respectively, where the following device fabrication processes including perovskite film deposition, hole transporting layer spin-coating and electrode layer evaporation deposition were carried out sequentially.
In the SCAE method for depositing perovskite films, a 507 mg mL−1 solution of PbI2 in a mixture of DMF and DMSO (1:1 mole ratio of PbI2 to DMSO) was firstly spin-coated on top of the thin mesoporous TiO2 layers at 3000 rpm for 30 s to form PbI2 films. CB (280 μL) was then dripped onto the PbI2 films for various loading times (0, 10 s and 20 s) before being spun again at 3000 rpm for 30 s to extract the residual solvents including DMF and uncoordinated DMSO molecules. The PbI2 films rinsed using CB were subsequently immersed into a solution of MAI in IPA (10 mg mL−1) for 1–8 minutes, followed by rinsing with IPA. The films were annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min to remove any residual solvent and improve the crystallization quality. The schematic of the SCAE sequential deposition process is presented in Scheme 1. For comparison, perovskite films were also deposited by the conventional two-step deposition method, in which PbI2 films were annealed at 100 °C for 5 min instead of rinsing with chlorobenzene.

After the preparation of perovskite layers, a spiro-OMeTAD based hole-transporting layer (72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 29 μL tBP and 18 μL Li-TFSI solution (520 mg mL−1 Li-TFSI solution in acetonitrile) all dissolved in 1 mL CB) was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by overnight storage in an electronic dry cabinet (≤15% RH) for oxidation. Finally, a 70-nm thick Au layer was deposited on top of the spiro-OMeTAD layer by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of around 3 × 10−6 Torr to finish the device fabrication.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Y-2000 Automated X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The surface morphologies of the PbI2 and perovskite films were obtained using a TESCAN Mira3 LMH field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). The cross-sectional images of photovoltaic devices were obtained on a dual beam focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy system (TESCAN Lyra3 XMH). The optical absorption of PbI2 and perovskite films was measured via a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 infrared spectrometer. The film thickness was obtained via a Dektak-XT profilometer. The steady-state photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite films were recorded on a RPM2000 photoluminescence spectrometer. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured with a PVIV-3A solar cell measurement system including a solar simulator and a Keithley 2400 source meter at room temperature. The AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 was calibrated by using a standard Si reference cell certificated by the National Institute of Metrology, China. The J–V curves were measured by reverse (forward bias (1.2 V) → reverse bias (−0.2 V)) or forward (reverse bias (−0.2 V) → forward bias (1.2 V)) scan. The step voltage and delay time were set to 10 mV and 200 ms, respectively. The effective area of the cell was defined as 3 mm2. External quantum efficiencies (EQE) were measured with a SPIQE200-5031 AC/DC I/EQE system in AC mode (Newport Corporation).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of PbI2 films on FTO glass prepared by the conventional and SCAE (loading time = 0) methods (labeled as C-PbI2 and SCAE0-PbI2, respectively). The inset shows the XRD pattern of the as-deposited PbI2 film from a DMF and DMSO mixed solution. Except for the diffraction peaks from FTO (marked by black solid dots), only one weak diffraction peak at 9.8° is shown for the as-deposited PbI2 film, which is consistent with the diffraction pattern of the PbI2(DMSO) film previously reported,25,26 indicating the formation of the PbI2·DMSO intermediate phase in the as-deposited PbI2 film here. Different from the as-deposited PbI2 film, four peaks located at 12.7°, 25.5°, 38.5° and 52.3° are detected for both C-PbI2 and SCAE0-PbI2 films, which can be assigned to the (001), (002), (003) and (004) lattice planes of hexagonal 2H polytype PbI2. However, the diffraction peaks of SCAE0-PbI2 show much lower intensity and wider full width at half maximum (FWHM) than those of C-PbI2, indicating less crystallization and smaller sizes of the PbI2 derived from the PbI2·DMSO intermediate complex via CB rinsing than the annealed counterpart. Moreover, as expected, the diffraction peak at 9.8° was not observed in the XRD pattern of the C-PbI2 film, owing to the decomposition of the PbI2·DMSO intermediates upon thermal treatment. However, unexpectedly, no obvious diffraction peak at 9.8° was detected in the SCAE0-PbI2 sample, either. This is probably due to the amorphous character of the PbI2·DMSO intermediate complex23 and/or the relatively high phase detection limit of the XRD technique, which makes its diffraction peak too weak compared to that of crystallized PbI2 to be visible. UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the C-PbI2, SCAE0-PbI2 and as-deposited PbI2 samples are shown in Fig. 2. The C-PbI2 film exhibits a remarkable absorption peak at around 500 nm, which is the characteristic band-gap excitation of a crystallized PbI2 semiconductor. For the as-deposited PbI2 film, it is clear that there is no such absorption peak, providing additional evidence for the formation of the PbI2·DMSO intermediate phase. As for the SCAE0-PbI2 film, the featured absorption peak of crystallized PbI2 can be seen in its absorption spectra, even though the absorption intensity is much lower than that of the C-PbI2 film, further proving that part of the PbI2·DMSO intermediate complexes have converted to crystallized PbI2 after CB rinsing.

Dipping these two PbI2/TiO2 composite films into MAI solutions in IPA for different time periods changed their color from initially yellow to finally dark brown (Fig. S1, ESI†), preliminarily indicating their different conversion rates of PbI2 to MAPbI3. We monitored the dynamics of the perovskite formation by using optical absorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction patterns. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the absorbance of perovskite converted from the C-PbI2 film increased slowly until 60 min. It should be noted that the absorption in the long-wavelength region above 770 nm also increased after around 35 min, as indicated by the ellipse in Fig. 3(a). This is usually ascribed to the scattering of incident light from the rough perovskite surface,35 implying that further prolonged dipping time after 35 min might roughen the perovskite layer. In contrast, the SCAE0-PbI2 film reacted relatively fast with MAI and the absorbance at 750 nm quickly increased to the maximum value after dipping for 8 min (Fig. 3(b)). Intriguingly, we found that the conversion of PbI2 to perovskite could be further regulated by the CB loading time before spinning out. For the PbI2 films with the CB loading time of 10 s and 20 s (hereinafter referred to as SCAE10-PbI2 and SCAE20-PbI2), as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d) and S1, ESI,† they reacted with MAI faster and faster, and their absorbance at 750 nm increased to the maximum value within 5 min and 1 min, respectively. Fig. 4(a)–(d) show the evolutions of their XRD patterns with dipping time. The C-PbI2 film converted to perovskite completely in around 60 min, while it only took 8 min, 5 min and 1 min for the SCAE0-PbI2, SCAE10-PbI2 and SCAE20-PbI2 films to fully convert into perovskite, respectively, further proving that CB treatment can indeed improve the conversion efficiency of PbI2 films.

As illustrated in the one-step method, anti-solvent rinsing has a significant impact on the film morphology.11,12,34,36 We compared the surface morphologies of C-PbI2, SCAE0-PbI2, SCAE10-PbI2 and SCAE20-PbI2 films (Fig. 5(a)–(d)) to investigate the possible reasons for the accelerated conversion process of the PbI2 films with CB rinsing. The C-PbI2 film consists of densely packed plate-like PbI2 crystals and very few voids. In contrast, the PbI2 films with CB rinsing (SCAE0-PbI2, SCAE10-PbI2 and SCAE20-PbI2 films) are porous structures composed of grains with sizes of several hundred nanometres. The fraction of voids in the C-PbI2 was only 0.4%, while the void fraction of the PbI2 films with SCAE treatments increased from 7.7% to 12.4% as the CB loading time was prolonged from 0 to 20 s. It should be noted that the fraction of voids in the PbI2 films was roughly estimated by the area fraction of voids on the film surface via the ImageJ software (Fig. 5(e)–(h)). The formation of compact PbI2 films by the conventional post-annealing method may be due to the self-organization of [PbI6]4− units and growth of PbI2 crystals in the process of thermal treatment. It was reported that films deposited under conditions leading to high atomic/ionic mobility tend to have large grain sizes.37 As the treatment went on, thermal energy provided by heating not only made the coordination solvent (DMF and DMSO) molecules evaporate, but also improved the ionic mobility of PbI2. Moreover, the relatively long post-annealing time (several minutes) required for full evaporation of solvent molecules also provided enough time for lead and iodine ions (namely [PbI6]4− units) to migrate/self-organize and grow into films consisting of densely packed PbI2 crystals and very few voids. As for the formation of porous PbI2 films after CB rinsing, it may be caused by the fast crystallization/precipitation of PbI2 particles and PbI2·DMSO intermediate complexes. When anti-solvent CB was dripped onto the wet PbI2 film, a supersaturated PbI2 solution was immediately obtained as DMF and uncoordinated DMSO molecules were rapidly extracted by CB. [PbI6]4− units, together with the PbI2·DMSO intermediate complexes, did not have enough time to self-assemble and grow into large grains before they precipitated out of the supersaturated PbI2 solution, and thereby porous structures composed of nano-scale PbI2 grains were formed. It is well-known that the formation of MAPbI3 from crystallized PbI2 is achieved by the intercalation of MAI molecules into the PbI2 lattice.9,14,20,38 For the compact C-PbI2 film, due to the lack of voids acting as diffusion paths for MAI molecules, MAI is expected to need much more time to penetrate into the inner PbI2 and complete the perovskite conversion. For the PbI2 films with CB rinsing, not only the voids but also the nano-sized PbI2 particles/intermediate complexes can facilitate the diffusion and intercalation of MAI molecules into PbI2, thus greatly accelerating the conversion process. The fraction of voids in the as-deposited PbI2 film is 5.4%, as shown in Fig. S2, ESI,† which is much larger than the C-PbI2 film but smaller than the PbI2 films with CB rinsing (SCAE0-PbI2, SCAE10-PbI2 and SCAE20-PbI2 films), implying the important effect of CB treatment on the final porous PbI2 film morphology. The formation of PbI2 films with a relatively small number of pores for the as-deposited PbI2 may be due to the removal of the volatile DMF molecules at room temperature. Furthermore, the XRD data (Fig. S3, ESI†) indicate that the complete conversion into perovskite for the as-deposited PbI2 film takes around 15 min, longer than that needed for the SCAE0-PbI2 film. In order to illustrate the effect of CB loading time on the porosity of PbI2 films and perovskite conversion rate, we further carried out FTIR measurements on powdered SCAE0-PbI2, SCAE10-PbI2 and SCAE20-PbI2. Note that all these powders were scratched off the corresponding SCAE0-PbI2, SCAE10-PbI2 and SCAE20-PbI2 films and their amounts were kept constant throughout measurements. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the featured stretching vibrations of SO at 1020 cm−1 for PbI2·DMSO34 are present in all the spectra, indicating the existence of the PbI2·DMSO intermediate phase in the films. However, compared to the strong stretching vibrations of SO for the SCAE0-PbI2, the vibration intensity is attenuated as the loading time of CB increases from 0 to 20 s, implying that the PbI2·DMSO intermediate phase can gradually decompose and turn into PbI2 with CB dipping and rinsing. The sites where the extracted DMSO molecules reside became accordingly small voids and thereby increased the film porosity. The transformation of the PbI2·DMSO intermediate phase into PbI2 upon CB rinsing can also be supported by their UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra. Fig. 6(b) shows the absorption spectra of the SCAE0-PbI2, SCAE10-PbI2 and SCAE20-PbI2 films. It is clear that the optical density of the characteristic absorption peak of PbI2 at 498 nm increases gradually from 0.34 to 1.45 with the prolonging of CB loading time, further demonstrating the decomposition of the PbI2·DMSO intermediate phase into PbI2. Considering this, we believe that the accelerated conversion of PbI2 into perovskite with CB loading time discussed above can be rationalized. It may be not only due to the increased porosity of the PbI2 films, but also due to the decreased PbI2·DMSO intermediate phase for which MAI needs to drive away the DMSO molecules on Pb2+ before perovskite crystals could be formed.23 The rapid and full transformation of PbI2 to perovskite is achieved by controlling the PbI2 grain size (porous structure) and PbI2·DMSO intermediate phase simultaneously. The porous PbI2 film formation by solvent coordination and anti-solvent extraction, as well as its conversion into perovskite is schematically shown in Scheme 2. The PbI2·DMSO intermediate complexes are not only capable of restricting the fast growth of PbI2 grains, but also capable of facilitating the formation and regulation of porous PbI2 structures consisting of small PbI2 grains and residual intermediate complexes in the SCAE process, which greatly accelerates the conversion of PbI2 into perovskite.

The red color regions indicate the voids on PbI2 films. The fraction of voids in the PbI2 films was estimated approximately at 0.4%, 7.7%, 10.8%, and 12.4% for C-PbI2, SCAE0-PbI2, SCAE10-PbI2 and SCAE20-PbI2 films, respectively.

We deposited the PbI2-free MAPbI3 films by converting C-PbI2, SCAE0-PbI2, SCAE10-PbI2 and SCAE20-PbI2 films within their required shortest transformation time (hereinafter referred to as C-PVK, SCAE0-PVK, SCAE10-PVK and SCAE20-PVK), and fabricated devices consisting of FTO glass/TiO2 blocking layer/thin mesoporous TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/gold (bilayered mesostructured configuration), as shown in the cross-sectional SEM image of the actual device in Fig. 7(a). Their performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The typical J–V curves are shown in Fig. S4, ESI.† It can be clearly seen that all performance parameters are influenced by the CB loading time. The highest average PCE of 14.5% with high reproducibility was achieved for the SCAE10-PVK device, which is much higher than that of the device without SCAE treatment and also outperforms the devices with SCAE0-PVK and SCAE20-PVK layers. We also made devices based on the MAPbI3 films derived from the as-deposited PbI2 films. As shown in Fig. S5, ESI,† these devices only have an average PCE of 11%, inferior to the SCAE10-PVK device. The best device with SCAE10-PVK, as shown in Fig. 7(b), exhibits a PCE of 15.66%, a Jsc of 20.46 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.04 V, and an FF of 0.74 under AM 1.5G solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2 in the reverse scan direction, and a PCE of 14.02%, a Jsc of 19.95 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.02 V, and an FF of 0.69 in the forward scan direction, yielding an average PCE of 14.84% with very small hysteresis. The integrated Jsc of 19.5 mA cm−2 from EQE data (Fig. 7(c)) agrees pretty well with the measured values.

To gain insight into the enhanced performance of the devices with SCAE treatment and 10 s of CB loading time, we first compared the morphologies of the C-PVK, SCAE0-PVK, SCAE10-PVK and SCAE20-PVK layers. As can be seen from Fig. 8(a) and (b) Fig. 8  Surface SEM images of (a) C-PVK, (b) SCAE0-PVK, (c) SCAE10-PVK and (d) SCAE20-PVK layers. , both the C-PVK and SCAE0-PVK layers have rough and inhomogeneous morphologies, and some large tetragonal column-like crystals exist on their surfaces, which may deteriorate their device performance as reported previously.39–41 Also, the poor performance of the device derived from the as-deposited PbI2 film may be induced by its rough and inhomogeneous perovskite film morphology, as shown in Fig. S6, ESI.† For the SCAE10-PVK and SCAE20-PVK films, as shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d), much more uniform film surfaces consisting of cuboid-like crystals can be observed. Moreover, the SCAE10-PVK film presents fewer pinholes than the SCAE20-PVK film, which is believed to be beneficial for device performance.20,42 The presence of fewer pinholes in the SCAE10-PVK layer is probably correlated with the appropriate porosity of the SCAE10-PbI2 film. The expanded MAPbI3 during the perovskite conversion/crystallization process probably can almost fully fill up the pores in the SCAE10-PbI2 film. In order to further illustrate the effect of the SCAE10-PVK and SCAE20-PVK film morphologies on the device performance, the steady-state photoluminescence of both films was measured to characterize their charge transfer and quenching properties. The photoluminescence spectrum (Fig. 9 Fig. 9  The steady-state photoluminescence spectra of SCAE10-PVK and SCAE20-PVK films on glass and sandwiched between TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD layers. ) of the SCAE10-PVK film on glass shows slightly stronger photoluminescence than the SCAE20-PVK film, implying that the former may contain fewer traps and defects. When both layers were sandwiched between TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD layers, the photoluminescence quenching of the SCAE10-PVK film was much more serious than that of the SCAE20-PVK film, indicating that the device with the SCAE10-PVK film was better in terms of charge transfer and charge collection than that with the SCAE20-PVK film.43,44 More detailed studies addressing the relation of perovskite crystallization to its morphology and device performance are currently underway in our lab and will be reported in due course.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a new solvent coordination and anti-solvent extraction (SCAE) strategy for preparing porous PbI2 films to improve the conversion efficiency of PbI2 to perovskite active layers in bilayered mesostructured perovskite solar cells. The morphology of PbI2 films can be easily regulated by the SCAE process, forming porous PbI2 templates for highly efficient perovskite conversion. The SCAE strategy shortened the full conversion time of PbI2 to perovskite from one hour for the conventional method to less than ten minutes by controlling the PbI2 grain size and the PbI2·DMSO intermediate phase simultaneously. The best device with SCAE treatment exhibits a PCE of 15.66% under AM 1.5G solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2 in the reverse scan direction. Our results demonstrate the high tunability of the PbI2 film morphology via solvent coordination and anti-solvent extraction, and the importance of PbI2 morphology regulation to its highly efficient conversion to perovskite and even photovoltaic device performance in a sequential deposition process. The shortened fabrication process by controlling the morphology of PbI2 is expected to facilitate industrially scalable manufacturing of perovskite solar cells in future.
