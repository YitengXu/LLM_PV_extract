    , Accepted 15th October 2020First published on 21st October 2020AbstractThe paradodecatungstate anions covered in this review span a continuum from molecular clusters to morphology-controlled tungsten trioxide (WO3) nanomaterials. The synthesized cluster compounds by using paradodecatungstate anions with various metal ions have various applications as precursors for the fabrication of tungsten carbide (WC), tungsten nitride (WNx) and tungsten trioxide (WO3) nanomaterials. The relationship between the synthetic approaches for the synthesis of morphology-controlled WO3 and their potential applications (such as photocatalytic activity, photodegradation, oxidation process, sensing and adsorption) has enhanced research interest in thoroughlyanalyzing these nanomaterials. Furthermore, some of the main synthetic approaches to synthesize WO3 and their hydrates (for improving the surface area, pore size and volume) are systematically summarized and highlighted. It is projected that this review article could propose strategies for designing hierarchical WO3-based nanomaterials with low expenditure and high competence, which could possess a promising scenario of applications to meet the urgent demand of nanomaterials with variable morphologies, such as nanorods, nanotubes, nanowires, nanofibres, nanosheets, nanoplates, nanoflowers and nanoflakes. The objectives of this review are to thoroughly study the various aspects for the synthesis and design of novel WO3 with low cost and high efficiency, the role of the paradodecatungstate anion-based clusters as precursors in their synthesis, and to apply these nanomaterials for various potential applications. Recent progress in the nano-sized WO3 and their hydrates has made their prospective applications even more attractive to researchers, bringing in colossal research challenges and even terrific opportunities for more constructive applications.

1. Introduction
Over the past decade, immense research attention has been focused on the broad area of polyoxometalates (POMs), which is known as an intriguing family of metal oxide clusters.1,2 These materials have been considered as inorganic building blocks (Keggin, Silverton, Wells–Dawson, Anderson, Lindquist, Waugh, Preyssler-type and isopolytungstate) for the design and synthesis of important inorganic–organic hybrid materials.3 However, only a few studies have ever been devoted to investigate the isopolytungstates and their novel structures, such as [W10O32]4−, [H4W19O62]6−, and [W24O84]24− (Fig. 1). Among the various types of isopolytungstates, paradodecatungstate B [H2W12O42]10− (para B) and paradodecatungstate A or α-metatungstate [H2W12O40]6− (para A) anions have captured immense attention owing to their high charge density on the surface, particular structural features and wealth of terminal oxygen atoms that provide a variety of possibilities of intermolecular linkages and high dimensional structures. Two protons of the [H2W12O40]6− polyoxoanion4–6 are situated within the central cavity of the Keggin structure, and are comparatively unapproachable. It is noted that solution control by the manipulation of pH, as well as cations, is very important in the synthesis of isopolyoxoanion clusters, and perhaps define a fascinating goal for controlling the cluster and crystal architectures in the crystal engineering techniques. One of the most intriguing features of these discrete isopolyanion building blocks is to link up into one-dimensional (1-D), two dimensional (2-D) or even three-dimensional (3-D) extended networks through suitable ligands, and the resultant clusters exhibit competent applications such as photocatalysis,7–10 degradation of organic substances,8 antitumor activities,11 and enthralling properties in the fields of electrochemistry,12–23 luminescence,7,8,24–26 magnetism27–37 and adsorption38 (Fig. 1).

Habitually, the paradodecatungstate derivatives can be fabricated by two methods. In the first method, fabrication has been done by using the template paradodecatungstate as precursors, and the second method involves an in situ production of paradodecatungstate derivatives from the tungstates [WO4]2− anion. In the course of investigation by the reaction between [W10O32]4− (metastable in aqueous solution) and the metal ions, it has been established that the [W10O32]4− polyoxoanion can be converted into para B [H2W12O42]10− in acetate buffer solution. Nevertheless, no proof of the structural transformation of [W10O32]4− to [H2W12O42]10− has been presented to date.24 The formation of an α-Keggin type structure of the [H2W12O40]6− anion is observed at lower pH, while the para B [H2W12O42]10− anionic unit being stabilized at higher pH is consistent with previous observations by Sprangers et al.39 on isopolytungstates. In their research work, Kong et al.17 mentioned the appearance of [H2W12O42]10− anions as the transformation of [H2W12O40]6− → [H2W12O42]10− during the course of the reaction, in which the driving force for the transformation, pH value of the system, the coordination ability of the polyoxometalate anions and the synergic effect of the transition metal ions have been involved (Fig. 2). Generally, there are two types of polymeric paradodecatungstate anion-based clusters: (i) clusters that join each other directly without the introduction of any other metals, and (ii) clusters that are connected by additional metal ions, such as alkali, alkaline, transition or lanthanide metal ions. After comparing both cases, the paradodecatungstate anion networks with extra binding metal ions have been developed more widely due to the convenience to connect discrete clusters, as well as the multiformity of structure and functionality for the bonded clusters. The assembly of functional paradodecatungstate frameworks has so far been accomplished by employing organic linkers or ligand-supported metal bridges, or purely inorganic polyoxoanion-based 3-D frameworks.40

Paradodecatungstate clusters have applications41–45 for various catalytic reactions, such as epoxidation, decomposition, and catalytic water splitting, and the synthesis of tungsten nitride (WNx), tungsten carbide (WC) and tungsten oxide (WO3) nanomaterials (Fig. 2). Tungsten oxides46,47 have a range of mixed valence compounds with the formula WnO3n−1, and form a diverse and technologically versatile group of materials. The crystal structure of WO3 is generally formed by a series of perovskite-like [WO6] octahedral building blocks with connecting corners in a 3-D framework. The [WO6] units undergo displacement of the innermost tungsten atoms with a change in temperature,48 and exhibit five lower symmetry crystalline phases from monoclinic ε-WO3 (less than −43 °C) → triclinic δ-WO3 (−43 to 17 °C) → monoclinic γ-WO3 (17 to 330 °C) → orthorhombic β-WO3 (330 to 740 °C) → tetragonal α-WO3 (greater than 740 °C). Apart from the tungsten oxides,49–55 transition metal oxides,56–62 rare-earth metal oxides63–65 and tin oxides66–68 are also showing importance in various fields, such as gas sensing56 and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.62 In the case of rare earth metal oxides such as CeO2, their morphology with a 1D structure is widely recognized as a key to modifying the chemical and physical properties due to the surface effect.63 The morphologies of ZnO with 1D structures, such as nanowires, nanorods and nanobelts; 2D structures, such as nanoplates; and thick-sheet based 3-D structures have a significant influence on the gas-sensing properties of nanomaterials.56 Nevertheless, the Fe-doped ZnO/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites show enhanced gas sensing performance to formaldehyde at relatively low temperatures, as compared to that of the bare ZnO and ZnO/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites. The mechanism of enhanced gas sensing was explained as the synergic effect of the reduced graphene oxide and Fe doping. After the addition of reduced graphene oxide and doping with Fe decreased the size of the ZnO hexagonal prisms and increased the surface area of the ZnO nanocomposites.57 Similarly, the Cu-doped SnO2 microstructures can significantly enhance the gas response of SnO2 toward H2S sensing. First-principles calculations reveal that the adsorption energy of H2S on the Cu-doped surface is lower than that on an undoped one. In addition, the interaction between the adsorbed H2S and Cu-doped surface is stronger than that between the adsorbed H2S and the pure surface, which consequently improves the gas-sensing performances of SnO2 toward H2S.67 Apart from that, the SnO2 nanosphere-functionalized TiO2 nanobelts show excellent sensing performances,60,68 which can be attributed to the fact that the decoration of the SnO2 nanospheres on the TiO2 nanobelts promotes the absorption of the oxygen species on the surfaces of the oxides due to the electron transfer. Furthermore, it is ascribed to the heterojunction effects emerging at the interfaces between SnO2 and TiO2, serving as additional reaction sites.68 In addition, the doping of graphene and europium on the TiO2 surface shows excellent performance for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, and increases with increasing doping concentration of europium.62 Great attempts have been allocated to fabricate WO3 and their hydrates with controlled morphologies, including 1-D (e.g., nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes), 2-D (e.g., nanosheets, nanoribbons) and 3-D nanostructures (e.g., urchin-like spheres, brush-like hierarchical structures, nanotrees, nanoflowers) to get diversification in their prospective applications.69–72 Among them, the 3-D hierarchical nanostructures with a large void space, high accessible surface area and a huge amount of available active sites have attracted much attention, which can facilitate the diffusion and adsorption of the reactants during reactions. Thus, the hierarchical nanostructures are considered as feasible candidates for gas sensors, photocatalysts,70,71 organic catalysts, dye-sensitized solar cells72 and photo/electrochemical water splitting. Besides, the size of WO3 can be controlled by using different concentrations of capping agents, such as SnCl4·5H2O. Astonishingly, these results are affecting the properties of the nanomaterials, their crystallite size, crystallization rate and final morphology.49 The carbon nanodots, rare earth metal53 and graphene55-doped WO3 nanostructures are important due to their applications in photocatalytic dye degradation or waste water treatment53 and hydrogen evolution reactions. This review article summarizes the recent research on synthetic approaches for paradodecatungstate anion-based clusters, their reticular design, and their uses as precursors for the synthesis of WO3 nanomaterials, and highlights their potential applications.
2. Early observations
The foremost structural exploration of the paradodecatungstate polyoxoanion in the compound 5Na2O·12WO3·28H2O or Na10[H2W12O42]·27H2O through single crystal X-ray diffraction was carried out by Lindqvist in 1952, in which tungsten atoms were positioned corresponding to the centered cell.73 Cruywagen et al.74 reported that the structure of Na10[H2W12O42]·26H2O, in which the reported unit cell volume was approximately half of that reported by Lindqvist,73 may be due to the absence of weak diffraction spots during the cell centering approximation. Similar compounds of the paradodecatungstate polyoxoanion with alkali metal ions, Na10[H2W12O42]·27H2O,75 K10[H2W12O42]·10H2O76 and (NH4)10[H2W12O42]·4H2O76 have been successfully synthesized by Chrissafidou et al. and Lunk et al., respectively. Earlier in 1997, Borisov et al.77 studied the packing of paradodecatungstate and the effect of the mutual ordering of the heavy cations in the structures with these anions. In 1983, Evans78 utilized neutron diffraction to study the location of the internal H-atoms of paradodecatungstate in (NH4)10[H2W12O42]·10H2O, (NH)10-[H2W12O42]·4H2O, (NH4)6H4[H2W12O42]·10H2O, Na2(NH4)8-[H2W12O42]·12H2O, Na10[H2W12O42]·20H2O and Mg5-[H2W12O42]·38H2O. Apart from the work on (NH4)6[H6W12O42]·10H2O79 by Pouchot et al., K10[H2W12O42]·7.5H2O80 and Na10[H2W12O42]·20H2O81 by Evans Jr., Na10[H2W12O42]·26H2O by Cruywagen et al.,82 [(CH3)4N]6[H2W12O40]·9H2O by Asami et al.,83 Na2(NH4)8[H2W12O42]·12H2O and Na7.5K2.5[H2W12O42]·22.2H2O by Peresypkina et al.84 and Rb4H8[H2W12O40]·18H2O by Jeannin et al.85 have been synthesized effectively. The anionic isomorph (NH4)6[H6W12O42]·10H2O, which has been reported by Gainsford et al.,86 comprises [H2W12O42]10− anions bound in an infinite 3-D network through H-bonding with NH4+ cations and water molecules. The compound (NH4)2(NH3(CH2)6NH3)4-[H2W12O42]·8H2O contains a centrosymmetric [H2W12O42]10− separated by the ammonium/1,6-hexanediammonium cations and water molecules in a pseudo-layered structure.87 Furthermore, Feng et al.88 synthesized a supramolecular cluster [NH3CH2CH2NH3]3H4[H2W12O42]·2.5H2O, which demonstrates a 3-D framework. It also witnesses the presence of electrostatic, as well as hydrogen bonding, interactions between the protonated ethylene diamine (en), [H2W12O40]10− and water molecules. The well-crystallized Keggin structures, DMA6[H2W12O40]·nH2O, DMA6[H2W12O40]·4H2O, TrMA6[H2W12O40], TrMA6[H2W12O40]·2H2O, TMA6[H2W12O40]·2H2O (DMA = dimethylammonium; TrMA = trimethylammonium; TMA = tetramethyl-ammonium), have been synthesized by Zavalij et al.,89 in which the NH4+ and CH3NH3+ ions form the pyrochlore structure type oxides, but NH4+ may also form the hexagonal bronze tunnel structure. Boskovic et al.21 synthesized metadodecatungstate salts, Na6[H2W12O40], [Bu4N]5H[H2W12O40], [Pr4N]5H[H2W12O40], [NH4]4H8[H2W12O40], [Bu4N]3H9[H2W12O40], [Bu4N]3H9[H2W12O40], [Pr4N]4H8[H2W12O40] and [Ph4As]0.5[Bu4N]2.5H9[H2W12O40] by phase transfer routes.
2.1. Paradodecatungstate B [(H2W12O42)10−] anion and TMCs-based clusters
The assembly of paradodecatungstate B anions through the introduction of transition metal complexes (TMCs) to expanded constructions is an effective approach for designing novel hybrids. A crucial factor for the construction of such architectures rests on the choice of appropriate organic ligands, which may be N-containing ligands such as 2,2′-bipyridine (2,2′-bipy), ethylene diamine (en), 2,2′-biimidazole (2,2′-bim), imidazole (imd) and aromatic carboxylate-based ligands such as 2-pyrazinecarboxylic acid (2-Hpzc). Lin et al.90 synthesized a compound [Cu(en)2]3[{Cu(en)2}2(H2W12O42)]·12H2O (1), which consists of 1-D [{Cu(en)2}2(H2W12O42)]n6n− anions with discrete [Cu(en)2]2+ cations. He et al.91 prepared [{Cu(en)2}4(H4W12O42)]·9H2O (2), which is formed by a [H2W12O42]10− polyoxoanion and [Cu(en)2]2+ cations. Each [H4W12O42]8− is united with its four contiguous clusters through eight {Cu(en)2}2+ bridging groups into a 2-D layered structure.
Zhang27 has synthesized polymeric compounds (NH4)8[Cu(H2O)2H2W12O42]·10H2O (3) and (NH4)4[Co(H2O)2][Co(H2O)4]2[H2W12O42]·8H2O (4), in which para B units act as tetradentate and octadentate ligands in (3) and (4), respectively. In (3), two neighboring para B clusters are associated via [Cu(H2O)2]2+ cations which further facilitate the formation of a 1-D chain. In (4), each Co2+ ion connects two para B clusters, while each [H2W12O42]10− is enclosed by two [Co(H2O)2]2+ and four [Co(H2O)4]2+ bridging cations, resulting in a 2-D sheet. Zhang et al.28 reported on the compound, [{Co(H2O)4}4(H4W12O42)]·10H2O (5), which exhibits a unique 8-connected 3-D framework with a (42·820·126) topology. Interestingly, each [H4W12O42]8− acts as an octadentate ligand coordinated to eight Co2+ ions, which represents the highest connectivity number of the para B clusters known to date. Zhang et al.29 reported on the compound [Cu(H2O)6][{Cu(H2O)2}2 {Cu(H2O)4H4W12O42}]·12H2O (6), in which [H2W12O42]10− acts as a decadentate ligand connected to six CuO6 octahedra, thus forming a 3-D architecture. The formation mechanism is not very clear for the reaction. However, it has been proposed that under the standardized conditions (initial pH = 3.85, 80 °C, 1 h and in the presence of Cu2+ ions), the [H2W12O40]6− unit is first decomposed to triangular W3O10 groups, and some of these groups then rearrange into the belt-type W3O11 groups. Subsequently, the two types of groups are tied together through interconnecting corners, forming a new cluster, i.e., [H2W12O42]10−. Yuan et al.32 produced the compound [Zn5(H2O)20(H2W12O42)]·16H2O (7), in which two neighboring [H2W12O42]10− are coordinated via [Zn4(H2O)14]8+ and thus, leads to the formation of a 2-D layer containing rhombic channels. Yang et al.34 prepared the compound (H3O)+2[{Fe(H2O)4Fe(H2O)3}2(H2W12O42)]·20H2O (8), in which the para B groups are coordinated with the Fe2+ ion to form a 3-D network. Yan et al.92 synthesized 1-D and 2-D solids, formulated as (enH2)4[{Cu(en)2}H2W12O42]·6H2O (9) and [{Cu(en)2}4Cu(H2O)2H2W12O42]·H2O (10), respectively. Two [H2W12O42]10− units are connected via [Cu(en)2]2+ and/or [Cu(H2O)2]2+ bridging fragments to form inimitable layered structures.
Radio et al.93 synthesized structures based on Co2+ ions and [H2W12O42]10−, where the hydroheptatungstate (HW7O245−) anion transforms into the [H2W12O42]10− anion. The conditions for the productive synthesis of neutral compounds {Co5[H2W12O42]·34H2O (11a) and Co5[H2W12O42]·37H2O} (11b), and an acidic compound Co4H2[H2W12O42]·34H2O (11c) have been optimized. Niu et al.94 synthesized the first hybrid material based on a metatungstate (para A) polyoxoanion and TMCs, formulated as [Cu(2,2′-bipy)3]2H2[H2W12O40]·4.5H2O (12). Each Cu2+ ion is coordinated by six nitrogen atoms from three 2,2′-bipy, forming a distorted octahedron. Lisnard et al.95 synthesized a 3-D compound {[Cu(en)2]3[Cu(en)]2H2W12O42}·27H2O (13) at neutral pH that was built from para B and Cu2+ ions from a mixture of Na2WO4, CuCl2 and ethylene diamine. Li et al.96 synthesized an organic–inorganic hybrid [enH2]2-[Cu(en)2]3[H2W12O42]·6H2O (14) by the mixing of Na2WO4·2H2O with CuCl2·2H2O, and the resultant product exhibits a 6-connected 3-D framework. Gao et al.18 synthesized three compounds, formulated as {[Cu(2,2′-bim)(H2O)2]4-(H4W12O42)}·14H2O (15), (Himd)6{[Mn-(imd)(H2O)](H4W12O42)}·2H2O (16) and {[Cu0.5(H2O)]2-[Cu0.5(H2O)2]2[Cu(2,2′-bim)(H2O)2]2(H4W12O42)}·10H2O (17). Compound (15) is an isolated structure and further modified with four {Cu(2,2′-bim)(H2O)2}2+ units. Compound (16) divulges an infinite 1-D “wave-like” chain based on the connection between [H4W12O42]8− and the [Mn(imd)(H2O)]2+ fragment. The 2-D layered structure of (17) is formed by the linkage of 1-D {[Cu0.5(H2O)]2(H4W12O42)}6− and the {[Cu0.5(H2O)2]2(H4W12O42)}6− anionic chains. Chen et al.37 synthesized a compound, H4{[Cu3(2-Hpzc)2(H2O)4] (H2W12O42)}·13H2O (18), in which each [H2W12O42]10− acts as a quadridentate ligand connected with four Cu2+ ions to form a 2-D layered structure. Žák et al.97 fabricated [Co5(H2O)22][H2W12O42]·12H2O (19) from [H2W12O42]10− joined by Co2+ ions, and exhibited an extended structure supported by versatile inorganic building units (Fig. 3 and 4).

2.2. Paradodecatungstate B [(H2W12O42)10−] anion and mixed metal ion-based clusters
The [H2W12O42]10− polyoxoanion has been extensively used for the erection of multidimensional frameworks due to its high charge density, and acts as a multidentate inorganic ligand for the coordination with mixed metal ions (alkali-, alkaline-earth, transition metal or lanthanides). Zhang et al.30 synthesized a 3-D network of Na2[Mn4(H2O)14(H2W12O42)]·16H2O (20) without adding sodium selenite and/or aluminum sulfate, which led to the construction of the {Mn4W12} unit consisting of [H2W12O42]10−, and connected via Mn2+ ions with the help of the Na(H2O)5+ fragment. Furthermore, Zhang et al.31 prepared a series of para B-based compounds H2{[K(H2O)2]2[Ln(H2O)5]2-(H2M12O42)}·nH2O (21a–j) (Ln = La3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Ho3+, Er3+, Yb3+, Lu3+, M = W/Mo), in which the resultant 3-D frameworks are constructed via the unification of the [H2M12O42]10− and Ln(H2O)53+ units in the presence of Al2(SO4)3 as an abduction agent. Yuan et al.32 fabricated the extended 3-D frameworks [Na8(H2O)28][Mn(H2O)2(H2W12O42)]·4H2O (22) and K[Na5(H2O)6][Sr2(H2O)6(H2W12O42)]·18H2O (23) based on the para B cluster and TMCs or alkaline-earth metal. The 2-D layered structure of (22) is fashioned by the interconnection of 1-D [Mn(H2O)2(H2W12O42)]n8− and [Na8(H2O)28]n8+ chains, whereas [Sr2(H2O)6(H2W12O42)]6− in (23) illustrates a layer-like arrangement in which the polyoxoanion acts as six-dentate ligands connecting six Sr2+ ions. In (22) and (23), the para B clusters serve as two- and six-dentate ligands, respectively, and link the secondary metal (e.g., Na+ and K+) ions, resulting in 3-D structures. Ying et al.8 synthesized [Cu(en)2Na8(H2O)28(H2W12O42)]·4H2O (24) by mixing [Cu(en)]SO4 with Na9EuW10O36 instead of Na2WO4 and [H2W12O42]10−. The [H2W12O42]10− ions are connected via [Na3(H2O)10]3+ and [Na2(H2O)8]2+ units to assemble an inorganic layered structure, and the [Cu(en)2]2+ units join these inorganic layers to build a 3-D framework. Yang et al.34 prepared novel extended iron-containing polyoxotungstate based clusters, namely K6{[Fe(H2O)4]2·(H2W12O42)}·15H2O (25) and Na5{[Fe(H2O)3]2[Fe(H2O)4]0.5(H2W12O42)}·30H2O (26).
Xu et al.98 synthesized compound [Na2(H2O)8][Na8(H2O)20]-[Cu(en)2][W12O42]·3H2O (27), in which Cu(en)22+ connects the [W12O42]12− polyoxoanion to form a 1-D chain, which is further organized with the Na8(H2O)208+ and Na2(H2O)82+ units to construct a 3-D framework. Wu et al.9 prepared a pure inorganic framework Na10{[Mn(H2O)3]2[H2W12O42]}-{[Mn(H2O)3]2[Mn(H2O)4][H2W12O42]}·56H2O (28), in which [H2W12O42]10− acts as a tetradentate ligand and links with four [Mn(H2O)3]2+ to form doubly bridged 1-D chains, which are further connected through the [Mn(H2O)4]2+ units into a 2-D layered structure. Teillout et al.14 prepared compound K2Na4[(Mn(H2O)3)2(H2W12O42)]·28H2O (29) via the reaction of MnCl2 with Na2WO4 and Zn(CH3COO)2 (pH of solution = 4.7). The [H2W12O42]10− ions are linked in pairs via Mn2+ ions, leading to the formation of linear chains of [(Mn(H2O)3)2(H2W12O42)]n6n−. In Na8{[Cd(H2O)2](H2W12O42)}·32H2O (30), two neighboring [H2W12O42]10− are linked by [Cd(H2O)2]2+, leading to the formation of an infinite 1-D chain of {[Cd(H2O)2](H2W12O42)}n8n− anions. The {[Co(H2O)3][Co(H2O)4] (H2W12O42)}n6n− anion of compound Na6{[Co(H2O)3][Co(H2O)4](H2W12O42)}·29H2O (31) shows a 2-D layer-like structure, in which the [H2W12O42]10− ions are connected by CoO6 octahedra.38 The {[Co(H2O)3]3(H2W12O42)}n4n− anion of (H3O+)3{[Na(H2O)4][Co(H2O)4]3(H2W12O42)}·24.5H2O (32) is a 3-D anionic polymer, consisting of [H2W12O42]10− units connected by CoO6 octahedra. In Na2Cu3(CuOH)2[W12O40(OH)2]·32H2O (33), the [H2W12O42]10− unit is surrounded by two centrosymmetric pairs of {Na(μ-H2O)2(H2O)3O} and {Cu(4)(μ-OH)2(H2O)3O}, along with six CuO6 octahedra, thus forming a 3-D framework.99 In the segregated crystals of Na6Sr2[W12O40(OH)2]·24H2O (34), the [W12O40(OH)2]10− units are crosslinked in a layered structure via NaO6 and SrO9 polyhedra, and crosslinking in a 3-D framework via NaO6 and NaO7 polyhedra.100
Qu et al.11 synthesized Na2Cu5(H2O)24(OH)2[H2W12O42]·10H2O (35), decorated by Cu2+ ions, in which [H2W12O42]10− behaves as a dodecadentate ligand and links the Cu2+ and Na+ ions to form a remarkable 3-D network. Qu et al.101 synthesized a compound, namely [Na2(H2O)10][Cu4(H2O)12(H2W12O42)]·15H2O (36), in which the [H2W12O42]10− unit is linked via Cu2+ ion as a purely inorganic building unit to frame a 3-D network. Loose et al.102 synthesized the compounds (Me4N)2Na2[Na2Co2H2W12O42(H2O)12]·16H2O (37) and Na3[NaCo3H2W12O42(H2O)16]·22H2O (38), in which the [H2W12O42]10− clusters act as hexa- and octa-dentate ligands, respectively. The [H2W12O42]10− fragments are connected to each other via Co–O and Na–O polyhedra to form a 3-D polymeric network. Li et al.35 synthesized an anionic 3-D open-framework, formulated as KNa3{Cu(H2O)2[Cu(H2O)3]2-(H2W12O42)}·16H2O (39) with (8,3)-connected structural topology. Li et al.103 synthesized compounds, namely Na8[Cu(H2O)2(H2W12O42)]·30H2O (40), Na8[Cd(H2O)2(H2W12O42)]·20H2O (41), and Na7.4[Cd1.3(H2O)2(H2W12O42)]·24H2O (42). Both (40) and (41) exhibit 1-D structures with two neighboring [H2W12O42]10− units connected via [Cu(H2O)2]2+ or [Cd(H2O)2]2+ fragments, while (42) displays a 2-D network that enriches the structure types of the Cu2+ and Cd2+ ion-bridged [H2W12O42]10−. Kong et al.17 synthesized 3-D frameworks, namely {[Na(H2O)5]2[Mn(H2O)3]2[Mn(H2O)4]2(H2W12O42)}·6H2O (43), {[Na(H2O)5]2[Co(H2O)3]2[Co(H2O)4]2(H2W12O42)}·8H2O (44) and {[Na2(μ-H2O)2(H2O)6][Cu(H2O)2][Cu(H2O)4]2[Cu2(μ-OH)2(H2O)6](H2W12O42)}·10H2O (45). Compounds (43) and (44) are isomorphic, in which the [H2W12O42]10− fragment is surrounded by eight TMCs ions (Co2+ ions for (43) and Mn2+ ions for (44)) and two Na+ ions. Each TMC ion connects two [H2W12O42]10− units, thus forming a 3-D framework. In (45), the [H2W12O42]10− unit connects two binuclear Na+, two binuclear Cu2+ and six mononuclear Cu2+ ions, generating a convoluted 3-D network. Gumerova et al.104 synthesized compounds, Na5Fe2.5[W12O40(OH)2]·36H2O (46) and Na4Cu3[W12O40(OH)2]·28H2O (47), by a suitable aqueous solution route. These compounds were built from the [W12O40(OH)2]10− unit, which behaves as a multidentate ligand and displays a cluster-like assembly that coordinates with TMCs and Na+ ions, thus forming a 3-D network. Yuan et al.24 isolated the compounds (H3O)3{[K(H2O)]2 [Na2(H2O)8]2(Na0.5H2O)2(H2W12O42)}·6H2O (48) and (H3O)2 {[K(H2O)4]2[Na3(H2O)9]2(H2W12O42)}·2H2O (49), which exhibit 3-D architectures with bridging Na+/K+ countercations for the [H2W12O42]10− anion. Gumerova et al.105 synthesized K6Ni2[W12O40(OH)2]·22H2O (50), in which the 2-D layers of the [H2W12O42]10− unit and the K+ ion form a 3-D network through NiO6 octahedra.
With further exploration, Giménez-Saiz et al.106 synthesized compound K6[Co(H2O)4]2[H2W12O42]·14H2O (51), in which the chain-like [(Co(H2O)4)2(H2W12O42)]n6n− polyoxoanion is formed by [H2W12O42]10− and Co2+ ions. Apart from that, Gao et al.18 synthesized {[Na(H2O)4]2[Cu0.5(H2O)]4[Cu0.5(H2O)1.5]2(H4W12O42)}·3H2O (52), which consists of [H4W12O42]8− as a building block to form a (6,2)-connected 3-D network. In the continuation of the above discussion, Dutta et al.36 isolated the compound, formulated as Na8{[Cu(gly)2]2}{H2(H2W12O42)}·24H2O (53) (gly = glycine), with an infinite 1-D polymeric chain that is built from (H2W12O42)10− and four [Cu(gly)2] fragments. Apart from that, Cui et al.10 synthesized the compounds, namely Ca2Na6[H2W12O42]·30H2O (54), Sr4Na2[H2W12O42]·30H2O (55) and Ba4Na2[H2W12O42]·29.5H2O (56), in which the [H2W12O42]10− clusters behave as multidentate building units and the alkaline-earth metal & Na+ cations as linkers, thus forming the 3-D frameworks. Žák et al.97 synthesized the compound [Co4Na(H2O)][H(H2W12O42)]·18H2O (57), in which paradodecatungstate is joined by Co2+ and Na+ ions to form a 3-D network (Fig. 5 and 6).

2.3. Paradodecatungstate A [(H2W12O40)6−] and lanthanide-based clusters
Compared to TMCs, the lanthanides have higher coordination numbers and more flexible coordination geometry, which make it difficult to control the preparation of lanthanide-based compounds, but helpful in the design of remarkable architectures. Therefore, researchers have aimed towards the development of a new synthetic strategy to obtain frameworks with lanthanide bridges. Yu et al.12 constructed two new compounds with the paradodecatungstate A anion and lanthanide–organic units, namely Ln(Hdpdo)2(H2O)6 [H2W12O40]·nH2O (Ln = Ce3+ and n = 17 for (60a), Ln = Nd3+ and n = 18 for (60b), dpdo = 4,4′-dipyridine-N,N′-dioxide). Both 60a & 60b are isostructural and their crystal structures show poly-pendant wave-like layers, formed by discrete {Ln(Hdpdo)2(H2O)6[H2W12O40]}− units. Yang et al.33 prepared isostructural compounds, [Ln3(Hdipic)(dipic)(H2O)13(H2W12O40)]·13H2O with Ln = Sm3+ (61a), Gd3+ (61b), (dipic = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate anion), in which four Ln3+ ions form a centrosymmetric regular rhombus-like ring {Ln4(dipic)2(Hdipic)2(H2O)12}6+(Sm4-ring). Shi et al.15 prepared (NH4)6[Ce(H2W12O40)(C4H2O4)(NO3)(H2O)3] (62), in which the [H2W12O40]6− cluster is utilized as a precursor and W–Ot–Ce–Ob–W connects a 1-D infinitely linear chain. Compound (62) represents the first characterized compound, in which the Ce3+ ions are coordinated by four different types of ligands, in constructing a lanthanide–dodecatungstate architecture. Pang et al.16 prepared three polyoxotungstate-based compounds, [(C6H5NO2)Ln(H2O)5]2[H2W12O40]·nH2O (Ln = Ce3+ (63a), Pr3+(63b), n = 7; Nd3+ (63c), n = 6), in which the α-metatungstate [H2W12O40]6− units are linked by lanthanide–organic coordination compounds, resulting in 2-D structures with helical chains.
Meng et al.107 synthesized the compound (NH4)2[Ln2(2-pyc)2(H2W12O40)(H2O)7]·nH2O (Ln = Ce3+ (64a), n = 9; Pr3+ (64b), n = 12; Nd3+ (64c), n = 11; Sm3+ (64d), n = 10; 2-pyc = 2-pyrazinecarboxylate), in which 2-pyc connects two different kinds of Ln3+ ions in the chelating-bridging tridentate coordination mode to form infinite 1-D zigzag chains, and [H2W12O40]6− acts as a pentadentate ligand that links five Ln3+ ions from three different zigzag chains, thus forming a complicated 3-D framework. Liu et al.108 synthesized isostructural compounds based on [H2W12O40]6− and Ln–organic compounds, namely (NH4)4[Ln2(3,5-pdc)2(H2O)9(H2W12O40)]·nH2O (Ln = Eu3+ (65a), Gd3+ (65b), Dy3+ (65c), n = 11; Tb3+ (65d), n = 12; 3,5-pdc = pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate). This polyoxoanion acts as a tridentate linker that connects three Ln3+ ions, and each Ln3+ ion links two polyoxoanions, resulting in the formation of a polymeric chain. Hu et al.25 synthesized eight new compounds [Ln4(2,6-pdcH)2(2,6-pdc)2(H2O)14(H2W12O40)]·nH2O (Ln = La3+ (66a), Pr3+ (66b), n = 14; Ce3+ (66c), n = 12; Nd3+ (66d), n = 17, 2,6-pdcH = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, 2,6-pdc = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate) and [Ln3(2,6-pdcH)3(H2O)10(H2W12O40)]·10H2O (Ln = La3+ (66e), Ce3+ (66f), Pr3+ (66g), Nd3+ (66h)). Compounds (66a–d) are isomorphic and show a 2-D structure. Compounds (66e–h) are also isomorphic and have a 3-D framework constructed from [H2W12O40]6− and Ln3+-2,6-pdcH. Chen et al.22 synthesized [H24,4′-bipy][Ln(DMF)4(H2O)3(H4,4′-bipy)][H2W12O40] (Ln = La3+ (67a), Ce3+ (67b); DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide, 4,4′-bipy = 4,4′-bipyridine), in which the [Ln(DMF)4(H2O)3(H4,4′-bipy)]4+ fragment is supported on an α-metatungstate anion. Pang et al.23 synthesized two polyoxotungstate-rare earth metal-based compounds, [(4-pyc)2Ln(H2O)3]2[H2W12O40]·nH2O (4-pyc = pyridine-4-carboxylate; Ln = La3+ (68a), n = 5; Ce3+ (68b), n = 7). Shi et al.26 synthesized the isostructural compounds, (NH4)5[Ln(NO3)2(H2O)3][H2W12O40]·H2O [Ln = Ce3+ (68c); Pr3+ (68d); Nd3+ (68e); Gd3+ (68f); Dy3+ (68g); Ho3+ (68h)], which represent the first example where two types of inorganic oxoanions NO3− and [H2W12O40]6− are simultaneously coordinated to Ln3+ ions (Fig. 7).

2.4. Paradodecatungstate B [(H2W12O42)10−] with s- and p-block metal based clusters
Xu et al.109 prepared the 1-D chain-like compound (NH4)7[Bi(H2W12O42)]·20H2O (69) with the most interesting structural feature because the para B anions are connected with Bi3+ (trivalent main group atom) for the first time to date in polyoxometalate chemistry. Rosantsev et al.110 prepared a compound Sr4.5H[W12O40(OH)2]·30H2O (70), in which each layer consists of [W12O40(OH)2]10− polyhedra, and the Sr2+ coordination polyhedra occupy the space between [W12O40(OH)2]10− units. Li et al.111 synthesized a compound namely, (NH4)2[Mg4(H2O)18(H2W12O42)]·10H2O (71), by reacting (NH4)10[H2W12O42]·4H2O with MgCl2. One Mg2+ ion-based octahedra shares an oxygen atom with the [W12O40(OH)2]10− cluster, and the other Mg2+ octahedra shares two oxygen atoms, each with different paradodecatungstate groups, to form a 1-D [Mg4(H2O)18(H2W12O42)]n2n− chain. Hao et al.112 reported an amphiphilic paradodecatungstate catalyst, [(C18H37)2N(CH3)2]9[NaH2W12O42] (72), which exhibits very high catalytic activity for the oxidation of dibenzothiophene in the model diesel into dibenzothiophene sulfones in the presence of a H2O2 oxidant. Cui et al.10 synthesized Sr4H2[H2W12O42]·26H2O (73), which consists of a [H2W12O42]10− fragment as the building blocks and the alkaline-earth metal cation as a linker. The most interesting feature is that it represents the first example of a 3-D all-inorganic framework, in which [H2W12O42]10− as a decadentate building unit was linked by pure alkaline-earth metal cations with the highest coordination number to date. Chaalia et al.19 reported an organic–inorganic hybrid 2-D supramolecular structure of Na2(HAn)8[H2W12O42]·16H2O (74) (HAn = p-anisidinium), which is formed by alternating paradodecatungstate/Na+ ion and p-anisidinium layers. They reported on other organic–inorganic hybrid materials, namely Na2(Himd)8(H2W12O42)·10H2O (75)113 and {Na10(H3N–CH2–COO)2[H2W12O42]}·28H2O (76),113 which are based on the [H2W12O42]10− polyoxoanion as the building blocks. Anyushin et al.114 synthesized (CH3NH3)4[(Mg(H2O)5)2(H6W12O42)]Br2·8H2O (77), in which the structure contains the [H2W12O42]10− unit coordinated with {Mg(H2O)5}2+ cations as ditopic ligands. Naruke et al.115 synthesized the compound Na10(gly)2[H2W12O42]·28H2O (78), in which two gly carboxylate oxygen atoms coordinate three different Na+ ions (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  Polyhedral representation showing 1-D chains {e.g., (69); (71); (74); (75)} and 3-D frameworks {e.g., (54); (56); (73)} of para B and s- & p-block metal ion-based clusters. 
2.5. Paradodecatungstate A [(H2W12O40)6−] and different metal ion-based clusters
The Keggin isopolyoxoanion, α-metatungstate, consists of twelve WO6 octahedra that are further arranged in four edge-shared (W3O13) triplets, as usually observed in the Keggin-type anions. This polyoxoanion possesses a higher charge density on its cluster surface, which can connect more metal ions to form interesting structures proficiently. The organic–inorganic hybrid [Ni(phen)(H2O)3]2[Ni(H2O)5] [H2W12O40]·6H2O (79) (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) has been isolated by Wang et al.13 The molecular fragment consists of two supporting [Ni(phen)(H2O)3]2+ coordination cations, one supporting [Ni(H2O)5]2+, and one [H2W12O40]6− unit. Another organic–inorganic hybrid material, [Cu(en)2(H2O)]2 {[Cu(en)2]H2W12O40}·10H2O (80) at low pH = 5, has been prepared by Lisnard et al.95 As a result of the Jahn–Teller effect, the Cu2+ ions exhibit axially elongated octahedral geometry, defined by two oxo ligands, and four nitrogen atoms of two en ligands defining a square. Lin et al.116 synthesized a compound, formulated as [Na6(H2O)11 (Me10Q[5])2][β-H2W12O40]·5H2O (81), (Me10Q[5]) = decamethylcucurbit[5]uril, in which [H2W12O40]6− and Me10Q[5] feature train-like structural subunits. Lin et al.97 prepared the compound [Cu(enMe)2(H2O)]{[Cu(enMe)2] [Cu(enMe)2(H2O)W12O40(H2)]}·0.33H2O (82) (enMe = 1,2-diaminopropane), in which a 1-D {[Cu(enMe)2] [Cu(enMe)2(H2O)W12O40(H2)]}2− chain shows a unique sinusoidal ruffling, constructed from decorated Keggin clusters and {Cu(enMe)2}2+ bridging groups. Li et al.118 synthesized a framework based on α-metatungstate and a mixed ligand, formulated as [Cu4(pzta)2(4,4′-bipy)4(H2O)6][H2W12O40]·2H2O (83) (pzta = 5-(2-pyrazinyl) tetrazole). There is a 2-D inorganic layer constructed by α-metatungstate clusters and Cu2+ ions, which is toughened by the assimilation of the dinuclear Cu2+ compounds to form a poly-pendant layer and further linked to 4,4′-bipy in pillar arrangement to generate a 3-D framework. Devi et al.119 synthesized compounds [Ni(2,2′-bipy)3]1.5{Ni(2,2′-bipy)2(H2O)[H3W12O40]}·0.5H2O (84), {[Ni(phen)2(H2O)]2[H4W12O40]}·4H2O (85), and {[Cu(phen)2]4[H2W12O40]}{[Cu(phen)2]2[H2W12O40]}·3H2O (86), which are constructed from the α-metatungstate core, and covalently linked to a secondary metal-organonitrogen ligand. In (84), the [H2W12O40]6− cluster is decorated by a single {Ni(2,2′-bipy)2(H2O)}2+ fragment to yield an anionic bimetallic cluster. In (85), two {Ni(phen)2(H2O)}2+ units are linked to the [H2W12O40]6− core to sketch a neutral bimetallic cluster. (86) is constructed of a cationic cluster, exhibiting a central [H2W12O40]6− core linked to four {Cu(phen)2}2+ fragments, and an anionic bimetallic polyoxoanion, featuring a [H2W12O40]6− core bonded to two {Cu(phen)2}2+ blocks. Colusso et al.120 synthesized a hybrid surfactant–isopolytungstate compound (CTA)7[H2W12O40]Cl·2H2O (87) (CTA = cetyltrimethylammonium), from an aqueous solution of [H2W12O40]6− and CTA+ ions to form a lamellar structure.
Chi et al.121 synthesized two enantiotopic 1-D chain-based compounds, [Cu3(bispy)3(H2O)2(H2W12O40)]·4H2O (88a, b; bispy = 2-(4,6-bis-(pyridin-2-yl)pyridin-2-yl)pyridine), from a [W7O24]6− anion, [(n-C4H9)4N]4[W10O32] or Na10[H2W12O42]. In contrast, if the [H2W12O40]6− based solution was used as the precursor, the achiral [Cu(bispy)]2[H4W12O40]·5H2O (89) was procured. When a terpyridine (tp) ligand having a coordination mode similar to that of bispy was used, the mesomeric dimer [Cu3(tp)3(H2O)(H2W12O40)]2·4H2O (90) was obtained from Na10[H2W12O42]. Dutta et al.122 synthesized a compound, formulated as [K2Cu3(H2O)10(W12O40)·2(H2O)]n (91), in which the [W12O40]8− ions are alternately coordinated to the KO4 tetrahedra to generate a 1-D chain, which are further interconnected by [Cu(H2O)]2+ units synchronously to form a 2-D framework. Streb et al.123 synthesized the modular assembly of a 3-D porous framework: [Ag(CH3CN)4]⊂{[Ag(CH3CN)2]4[H3W12O40]} (92), in which the protonated α-metatungstate [H3W12O40]5−({W12}5−) and dimeric {[Ag(CH3CN)2]2}2+({Ag2}2+) bridging units are coordinated likewise to surround two pairs of colinear channels. The [Ag(CH3CN)4]+ units are located in the channels and emerge to act as templates in the self-assembly of the framework,40 so they can be represented as {Ag}⊂[{W12}{Ag2}8/4]. Son et al.124 synthesized two intercluster salt compounds, [Al13O4(OH)24(H2O)12][H2W12O40](OH)·20H2O (93a) and [Al13O4(OH)24(H2O)12][H2W12O40](OH)·24H2O (93b), which are polymorphs to each other with different approaches of packing the Al13O4(OH)24(H2O)127+ and (H2W12O40)6− ions. Christian et al.125 have used several techniques for the structural study of the Keggin-type compound (NH4)6[H2W12O40]·nH2O (94) (n = 0, 1, 4, 20), which is a potential fuel cell catalyst. Yang et al.126 synthesized a 3-D organic–inorganic compound based on the Ag+ ion and α-metatungstate cluster, namely {[Ag(H2O)3(BuiNH2)4]2Na2H2(H2W12O40)}·4H2O (95). The [H2W12O40]6− unit acts as a tetradentate linker and it coordinates to four Ag+ ions, leading to the design of a novel 3-D purely inorganic framework. Zhang et al.127 have synthesized a 3-D hybrid based on mixed metal ions (TMCs and alkali metal) with α-metatungstate, namely Na4[Ag6(nic)4][H2W12O40]·12H2O (96) (nic = nicotinate). Each of the [H2W12O40]6− is surrounded by ten silver centers, which represent the highest connected number of the α-metatungstate clusters to date. Zhang et al.128 have reported on the compound, [Cu(bbi)]5H[H2W12O40] (97) (bbi = 1,10-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(imidazole)), which represents the first interpenetrating network based on the [H2W12O40]6− polyoxoanion (Fig. 9).

2.6. Catalytic properties of paradodecatungstate A and B anion-based clusters
The catalytic oxidation of olefins has been gaining a lot of interest in order to produce pharmaceuticals, as well as fine chemicals. Generally, epoxides are exclusively synthesized through the oxidation of olefins. They are used as important intermediates for the manufacturing of valuable chemicals, especially for the production of biologically active products. To date, different types of oxidants have been employed in the catalytic oxidation reaction, such as organic peroxides, m-chloroperbenzoic acid and iodosylarenes. However, these oxidants have some limitations due to their high cost, low atom economy and toxicity. To overcome these limitations, the use of cheap and eco-friendly H2O2 as an oxidant for catalytic oxidation reactions is the most favored option. Paradodecatungstate anion-based clusters as catalysts for catalytic oxidation reactions have been gaining more attention recently due to their immensely good catalytic activity (Table 1), as well as selectivity, acidic nature and controllable redox properties. In the early twenties,129–131 researchers constructed a solid-phase-assisted epoxidation reaction system for the epoxidation of cycloalkenes and allylic alcohols using solid tungstic acid (H2WO4) and a solid urea–H2O2 complex without solvent. For an appropriate solid phase, a biomaterial called apatite is elected because of its ion exchange ability and affinity for organic compounds. The combination of fluoroapatite (FAp) and the tungstic acid catalyst with solid urea–H2O2 is an effective reaction system for promoting the epoxidation reaction on the solid phase. After that, the researchers showed interest in paradodecatungstate cluster-based catalysts for organic synthesis because of their high thermal stability and reusability. For instance, the catalytic performance of (28) shows an efficient selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with 90% benzyl alcohol conversion and 93% benzaldehyde selectivity.9 Compounds (37) and (38) show catalytic properties for the oxidation of alcohols (e.g., cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone with 46% yield w.r.t. reactant) with H2O2.102 Compound (1) is used as a catalyst for the photooxidation of cyclohexane to yield cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol in the ratio of about 2.5:1 as the products with 760 Torr of O2.90 Compounds (83)118 and (40–42)103 show good electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of nitrite, (2) shows activity towards the epoxidation of maleic anhydride,91 (74) shows cyclooctene epoxidation132 with hydrogen peroxide19 and (91)122 shows the catalytic oxidation of styrene and cyclohexene.

From these results, it has been confirmed that MeCN is the most effective solvent for the epoxidation reactions, and H2O2 is a better oxidant than tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) and sodium perchlorate (NaClO4). In (91), the styrene conversion is 88% with 70% epoxide selectivity, and the cyclohexene conversion is 81% with 63% epoxide selectivity. Ichihara et al. developed a new catalytic solid phase system for the epoxidation reactions of allylic alcohols and cyclic alkenes by utilizing the urea–H2O2 complex and cetylpyridinium dodecatungstate ((CetylPy)10[H2W12O42]) catalyst on FAp.133 The FAp phase plays imperative functions in the diffusion of the active species on its surface for stabilization, thus leading to high catalytic performance and reusability.134 Based on these kinetic and spectroscopic studies,135 it has been suggested that the active species (CetylPy)10[H2W11O40WO(O2)] is a stable peroxo-species with the framework of paradodecatungstate, of which the terminal W(O)2 site of (CetylPy)10[H2W12O42] is particularly converted to the peroxo-type of WO(O2). The peroxo-species carries out the epoxidation reaction, cycling back to the inactive parent cluster, in the FAp disperse phase system. A much higher efficiency of the paradodecatungstate compared with the phosphotungstate or the decatungstate is considered due to the easy formation of non-degraded, site-specific peroxo-species. Wang and coworkers69 mentioned the pH-controlled assembly of 3-D WO3 hierarchical nanostructures for the catalytic oxidation of cyclohexene to adipic acid (Fig. 10). A novel 3-D open bimetallic Cu3[H6W12O42] cluster was prepared from an acidified solution (pH = 4.0) of (NH4)6H2W12O40 and aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2. This cluster behaves as an effectual catalyst for the hydrolysis of the renewable biomass inulin (conversion ∼100%) to produce fructose (selectivity ∼90%) at low temperature under aqueous condition with economic feasibility.43 The catalyst can be isolated from the reaction system by centrifugation, which is reusable and shows high catalytic activity after five runs.

2.7. Precursors for tungsten oxide (WO3) nanomaterials and other composites
Over the past decade, WO3 nanomaterials can be prepared from a facile hydrothermal method with the exact crystalline structure being determined by the cations in solution, and are assembled by the closely packed and highly aligned thin nanowires.136 Colusso et al.120 described the synthesis of CTA–paradodecatungstate from a solution of WCl6 and CTA-Br (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide). Keggin anions are notorious to build from tungstate solutions in the presence of large quaternary-ammonium cations at higher pH. When a bulky quaternary ammonium ion such as N(C4H9)4+ is intercalated into the interlayer of the layered metallic acids, the swelling of the interlayer leads to the exfoliation of the metallate layers to provide metallate 2-D nanosheets. Metal alkoxide was stirred with a solution of R(CH3)3N+OH− (R = methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl), and then diluted with water to obtain aqueous sols of colloidal layered nanocrystals. Aqueous sols of the colloidal layered tetramethylammonium (TMA)-tungstate nanocrystals were obtained by diluting an aqueous suspension of (TMA)6[H2W12O40]·nH2O (n = 5 and 9, TMA = trimethyl ammonium cation) precipitates, as reported by Ban et al.47 A pH-dependent synthesis of the organic-cation-Keggin compounds has been observed where at higher pH, the protons within tungstate anions are gladly exchanged by the larger CTA+ cations. In contrast, at lower pH, this process is hindered by the fabrication of WO3·nH2O. During heating of the solution of (NH4)6[H2W12O40] and CTA-Br between 240 and 330 °C, the removal of about 40% of the organic material was observed and Keggin ion units were organized in 2-D hexagonally-packed sheets of WO3. When bulky quaternary ammonium ions such as N(C4H9)4+ are intercalated into the interlayer of encrusted metallic acids, the distension of the interlayer leads to exfoliation of the metallic layers to provide nanosheets. Thus, for the preparation of metallate nanosheets, the encrusted metallates with quaternary ammonium ions in the interlayer are required. Slow evaporation of colloidal-layered tungstate sols led to the deposition of TMA-polyoxoanion, which drastically reduced the quantity of layered tungstate nanocrystals. Moreover, the increase in the amount of TMA+ in the sols also facilitated the precipitation of polyoxoanion clusters because of a common ion effect. The suspension of the TMA-polyoxoanion possibly affords the extremely water-dispersible layered tungstate nanocrystals.
Jeong et al.137 synthesized rare-earth metal–paradodecatungstate nanosheets with different morphologies by the self-assembly of layered rare-earth hydroxide colloidal solutions and paradodecatungstate solution (pH > 7). Sadakane et al.70 reported on the well-ordered 3-D macroporous WO3 with a high pore fraction and nano-crystalline granules by utilizing ((NH4)6H2W12O40) as a precursor in the colloidal crystal template method (eqn (1)). (NH4)6H2W12O40 → 12WO3 + 6NH3 + 4H2O(1)Nonetheless, WO3 nanomaterials were synthesized by other commercially available tungsten precursors (e.g., WCl6, W(OEt)5, and H3PW12O40), but they have a low 3-D ordered macroporous pore fraction. Non-porous WO3 were prepared from ((NH4)6H2W12O40) (AMT) without poly(methyl metacrylate) as a colloidal crystal template, and nurtured to crystal sizes of several micrometer and low specific surface area. In the presence of poly(methyl metacrylate) spheres as a template, the WO3 crystals cultivate in the nanometer-sized voids with the specific surface area thus enhanced up to thirty times, as compared to non-porous WO3. The calcination process of the 3-D ordered macroporous WO3 lead to the formation of nano-crystalline particles by sintering-induced disassembly. These nano-crystalline particles show higher photocatalytic activity for the decomposition of acetic acid in air under visible light irradiation after loading with platinum.71 Schieder et al.44 gave a simple route towards the synthesis of highly crystalline and hierarchically porous WO3 nanotubes. The inorganic precursor ((NH4)6H2W12O40) is grafted over the polyelectrolytic polymer namely, poly(butadiene)-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (PB-b-P2VP) (Fig. 11(a–e)), and thus Coulomb interactions between the protonated polymer and [H2W12O40]6− promote the formation of the hybrid material. The hierarchically porous, condensed, crystallized and mesostructured WO3 nanotubes with a surface area of 25 m2 g−1 are confirmed after calcination at 490 °C with a high rate of photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB).

Apart from the WO3 nanomaterials, tungsten nitride (WNx) materials (Fig. 11(f and g)) have also been prepared from [H2W12O40]6−-based clusters,42 which have shown unique properties in many fields such as energy conversion, catalysis and storage. The unusual compound hexagonal δ-WN is potentially more hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) active than β-WN (Fig. 11(h)), but the δ-WN has acknowledged far less attention, which is chiefly because δ-WN is unsteady at high temperature, as well as the mixed phases of W3N4 with only a small amount of δ-WN obtained. To continue addressing the critical challenges existing in the synthesis of metal nitrides or carbides, new strategies to access materials with special phases have been introduced. The phase transfer strategy has been used for converting β- to δ-WN and for this, the Co-metal–organic framework (Co-MOF) has been introduced with the tungsten precursor. The resultant mixture is then transformed into the δ-WN/Co composite through NH3 calcination treatment. The highly crystalline, monophasic hexagonal ammonium tungsten bronze, formulated as (NH4)0.33−xWO3−y, is a gifted component of transitional “tungsten blue oxide” in non-sag tungsten production (e.g., powder metallurgical production of tungsten lamp filaments), and a material of chromogenic and sensor interest.41 Its construction has been accompanied by the fractional thermal reduction of (NH4)10[H2W12O42]·4H2O, in flowing H2/He at 10%. It produces an intermediate product (called “tungsten blue oxide”), which is a possible mixture of different phases, between 400 and 600 °C. It is doped with potassium, aluminium and silicon that ensure an overlapping crystallite structure of tungsten powder, after complete reduction in hydrogen. It finally affords the appropriate mechanical stability (a so-called “non-sag” feature) to tungsten filaments even at high operating temperatures in lamps. When heating (NH4)10[H2W12O42] up to a higher temperature, hexagonal ammonium tungsten bronze voluntarily emerged between 350 to 600 °C and also escorted by other phases (e.g., m-WO3, o-WO3 or h-WO3 in air; tetragonal hydrogen tungsten bronze, WO2.9, WO2.72 and WO2 in reducing gases). Furthermore, hexagonal ammonium tungsten bronze ((NH4)0.07(NH3)0.04(H 2O)0.09WO2.95) was used to prepare h-WO3 by annealing at 600 °C for 2 h in air.138
3. Tungsten trioxide (WO3) nanomaterials
In earlier reports,46–48 WO3 nanomaterials were designed via variable synthetic approaches (using WCl6, Na2WO4, H2WO4 and CaWO4 as tungsten precursors apart from paradodecatungstate clusters) and attracted much research interest due to their potential application in miscellaneous fields (Table 2). The development of novel nanomaterials from isopolyoxoanion cluster compounds for adsorption, catalysis, magnetism, and electrochemical reactions has been a major target for a long time. The main approaches towards this goal include the functionalization of the metal oxide fragment itself, the interlinking of the H-bonded isopolyoxoanion building units or the use of hybrid cluster fragments as multidentate ligands binding to polynuclear coordination clusters. One of the major limitations in the development of such materials is that the underlying design strategies lying within the boundaries set by the serendipitous self-assembly of metal ions, bridging ligands and the polyanion building blocks. Furthermore, these hybrids are shown to self-assemble in solutions, forming vesicles as proved by light scattering and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques and DLS measurement.

In the continuation of this discussion, the urea-assisted fabrication of morphology-controlled WO3 from nanobricks to nanorods, then nanoflakes and finally nanobelts assembled with different 1-D nanosized building blocks at different pH values (0.74, 1.08 and 6.80), has been achieved by Li and co-workers. WO3 possibly will transform from o-WO3·0.33H2O to h-WO3 (Fig. 12), and show an increasing percentage of the [0 2 0] facet by controlling the amount of urea. Two NH proton donors and a CO proton acceptor enable urea to insert into the layers of the WO3 hydrates, and its weakly basic nature allows it to cause a change in the pH value through hydrolysis. Intriguingly, the quantity of urea influences the degree of hydrolysis during the hydrothermal process, and in addition to the delamination effect.139

3.1. Hydrated tungsten oxide nanomaterials
In recent years, scientists have made some advancement in fabricating mono- (WO3·H2O), di- (WO3·2H2O), hemi-hydrate (WO3·0.5H2O) and WO3·0.33H2O using different synthetic approaches because of their enormous applications in the fields of gas sensing, photocatalysis and adsorption. These nanomaterials behave as good candidates as compared to anhydrous WO3 for proton-conducting solid electrolytes in fuel cell applications. Interlayer water in hydrated WO3 has a layered nature through the van der Waals interaction between two terminal oxygen atoms among the WO6 octahedra.140 The presence of intermediate water content in WO3·0.33H2O leads to the metallic nature at room temperature, which gradually switches to a semiconducting phase with an increase in temperature, accompanied by the breakage of the van der Waals interaction. The reticular design and morphological characteristics (such as grain size or shape) are regarded as particularly important in affecting their chemical and physical properties, and the morphology strongly depends on the synthetic approaches. Materials with layered structure possess high surface ratio, which could significantly enhance the electrochromic performance, and thus will be an ideal platform for fabricating electrochromic devices with fairly good optical modulation and high cyclic stability.

3.1.1. Synthetic approaches. 
It is well known from the literature reports that the physical and chemical properties of most nanomaterials are strongly dependent on their shape and structure. Consequently, controlling the shape and size of materials to acquire enviable properties is always one of the most exigent tasks for material specialists. For the fabrication of WO3 hydrates, hydrothermal141–143 or solvothermal144 routes can be used owing to the advantages in controlling the morphology, size, and homogeneity at mild temperatures for large-scale production. Nevertheless, these synthetic approaches are habitually escorted by some shortcomings, such as high temperature and pressure and low effectiveness. Thus, it is still a great challenge to develop simple, reliable and facile synthetic routes for the large-scale production of hierarchical WO3 hydrates with designed chemical components and controlled morphologies. Amid the diverse solution-based synthetic approaches, the ion exchange method has been displayed to be one of the best routes to amplify the compositional assortment of inorganic functional substances. Hierarchical mesoporous WO3·0.33H2O nanorod and WO3·H2O nanosheet assemblies have been synthesized via this method by adjusting the concentration of Na2WO4·2H2O and other precursors (e.g., Na2SO4,145 CaWO4146), which will affect and control the morphologies and phase structures.147 He et al.148 fabricated WO3·0.33H2O nanostructures via hydrothermal method without the assistance of any surfactants or templates, but using some kind of metal salts (e.g., NaCl, CaCl2, BaCl2, SrCl2) as the structure-directing agent. Ca2+ acts as the capping agent to preferentially adsorb onto the (0 1 0) facet of the WO3·0.33H2O nanocrystal, while Cl− adsorbs onto the (1 0 0) and (1 0 0) facets, leading to the formation of a 3-D network. Nitric acid could induce and greatly enhance the directing role of salts in the preparation of WO3·0.33H2O networks because in the absence of nitric acid, only irregular particles of CaWO4 were obtained. Huang et al.149 fabricated WO3·H2O prepared with a simple and environmentally benign chemical solution route by the addition of a varying amount of HCl solution in the absence of high temperature, surfactant, template and structure-directing solvent. In 2012, Jianfeng et al.150 fabricated facile, additive-free WO3·nH2O particles with controlled morphology and phase transition by the simple mixing of tungsten powders with H2O2 in the presence of peroxo-polytungstic acid (Fig. 13). This acid was used as a precursor to achieve the 3-D morphology of WO3·nH2O particle evolution for the first time to date. Ahmadi et al.151 prepared leaf-shaped nanoplatelets and nanoribbons of WO3·H2O by aging (by addition of HCl) sodium tungstate solutions, and followed by heat treatment to obtain anhydrous WO3 nanorods (Fig. 14(a–c)). Two steps are necessary to obtain WO3 materials: protonation of tungstate ions obtained from Na2WO4·2H2O, and then dimerization and crystallization occur. By the assistance of organic acids152,153 (e.g., tartaric, citric, oxalic, malic acid and p-nitrobenzoic acid154) and surfactants as structure-directing agents, as well as using carbon paper for the deposition of nanomaterials via high temperature-reactive vapor deposition process, 3-D nanomaterials can also be synthesized. The wet chemical fabrication of monodisperse WO3·H2O square nanoplates with the assistance of an organic acid proved to be an effective way to prepare products with the structure of nanoplates. The selective absorbance of –OH groups of acid onto the [0 1 0] facet of the [WO5(OH2)] layer may result in the good dispersion and small size of WO3·H2O, which has been usually prepared through the liquid-phase synthesis routes, and then annealed to form WO3 after the removal of crystalline water.152,153 Li et al.155 synthesized WO3·H2O nanoplates and the flower-like assemblies by changing the amount of oxalic acid, and the effect of action time and temperature on the sizes of assembled nanostructures via in situ assembly of nanoplates to nanoflowers was also examined. Salmaoui et al.156 reported the fabrication of o-WO3·0.33H2O with chrysanthemum-like and disk-like structures by surfactant-assisted hydrothermal route in acidic medium with pH = 1. The N-alkyl chain length of the surfactant [CnH(2n+1)SO4Na (with n = 10, 12 and 14)] was found to play a key role in the crystallite sizes and morphology. These materials displayed reversible redox behavior in LiClO4/propylene carbonate, accompanied by the reversible intercalation/deintercalation of Li+ cations into their crystal matrices.

Apart from that, various methods, such as chemical vapor deposition, laser-assisted catalytic growth, microwave-assisted synthesis and the use of a hard template, have been employed to prepare unique micro- and nano-architectures. Microwave-assisted synthesis has become popular in the preparation of inorganic functional materials because of environmentally friendly, economic, and time-saving steps for the preparation of micro/nanoscale materials with higher yields. Among many habitual nanomaterials, WO3·0.33H2O microstructures have been lucratively fabricated via a facile microwave-assisted solvothermal route employing Na2WO4·2H2O and HCl as starting reagents and sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate as a structure-directing agent in a mixture of water and glycerol.157 Perfecto et al.158 synthesized WO3·0.33H2O nanocolumns (surface area 125 m2 g−1) via combination of an ultrasonic spray nozzle and microwave-assisted hydrothermal methods by using glycine that played an important role in the crystal growth in a preferred direction. With further exploration, the coalescence of the microwave-assisted hydrothermal with ultrasonic spray nozzle method can be employed to facilitate the synthesis of new materials with controlled morphology. Liu et al.159 fabricated mesoporous WO3·0.33H2O nanorod assemblies (10 to 20 nm diameter and 4 nm pore size) via proton exchange method. The formation mechanism of the mesopores is probably attributed to the loss of H2O in the structures. H+ coordinates with WO42− to produce WO3·H2O (eqn (2)). Subsequently, WO3·H2O dehydrates to generate WO3·0.33H2O (eqn (3)). The densities of WO3·H2O and WO3·0.33H2O are 5.5 and 6.4 g cm−3, respectively, so the volume decreases in the transformation process from WO3·H2O to WO3·0.33H2O, leading to the formation of mesopores. 2H+ + WO42− → WO3·H2O(2) WO3·H2O → WO3·0.33H2O + 0.67H2O(3)


3.1.2. Morphology. 
Morphologies of WO3 nanomaterials are affected by synthetic methods, precursors and structure-directing agents145 (e.g., metal salts, organic acids, surfactants), which can be justified by taking some relevant instances from literature. It is indispensable to scrutinize the influence of the above mentioned factors on the morphology, in order to organize 1-D/2-D WO3 structures into 3-D WO3 frameworks.152,153 Up to now, many approaches have been adopted to synthesize WO3 nanostructures with diverse morphologies, including nanotubes, nanowires, nanorods,143 nanoplates,145,152,153 square slab-like,149 urchin-like,146 microflowers,141,142 pyrochlore-type144 and hollow spheres.146 In the layered hydrated WO3·0.33H2O nanosheets,140 the influences of the structure directing agents (NaCl, CaCl2, BaCl2, SrCl2), valence state of cations (e.g., Na+, Ca2+), radius of cations (e.g., Ca2+ < Sr2+ < Ba2+), molar ratio of tungsten to metal (Ca, Ba, Sr) (Fig. 14(d–l)), and reaction time on the crystal structure and morphology of the nanosheets have been reported by He et al.148 In another report by Huang et al.,149 the square slab-like and flower-like WO3·H2O architectures obtained by the addition of a varying amount of 10.0 M HCl (Fig. 15) and further calcinations at 400 °C lead to the formation of 3-D WO3. The morphology of WO3 and their hydrates shows an obvious evolution in the particle size with the influence of the reaction time and peroxo-polytungstic acid (structure-directing agent) from hexagonal plates to round angular blocks, to 3-D hexagonal gears, through irregular nanosheets.150 The WO3·0.33H2O microstructures, such as micronutlets, microflowers, and microdiscs (Fig. 16(a–c)), have also formed from the influences of the reaction time, temperature, ratio of water and glycerol and the amount of Na2H2EDTA and HCl.157 Zeng et al.142 fabricated the WO3·H2O flower-like architectures with four different petal thicknesses (rose-like, sphere-like, sheet-flower and plate-flower) assembled by numerous nanosheets or nanoplates depending upon the reaction conditions, concentration of the precursor and the structure-directing agent.

3.1.3. Properties and applications. 
Mono-, di- and hemi-hydrates of WO3 are reported to be good candidates for proton-conducting solid electrolytes for fuel cell applications. After the mechanical exfoliation in hydrated WO3, the resultant materials show enhanced optical and structural properties. A mixture of WO3 and hemihydrare WO3 performed well as a pseudo-capacitive material140 under electrochemical water splitting or hydrogen evolution investigations.149,151,160 Apart from that, the hierarchical WO3·0.33H2O mesoporous nanorod assemblies show promising applications to form photochromic devices, such as smart windows, nonemissive displays, photochromic switches and information storage media, and also show fatigue resistance properties.159
Urchin-like WO3·0.33H2O and flower-like WO3·H2O nanomaterials show a high specific surface area149 with abundant semi-closed spaces with broad robustness, and several adsorption functional groups (e.g., WO) and O–H bonds on the surface. These characteristics show the greatest ability to expedite the mass transportation, and provide more hollow micro reaction rooms for the gas reaction.141 These characteristics result in the excellent adsorption and photodegradation performance for organic dyes/pollutants, organic solvents (toluene, acetone, ethanol, methanol and n-butanol)149 and heavy metal ions from waste water.145,146 Gas sensors based on two monodisperse o-WO3·H2O show good gas-sensing to 100 ppm C2H5OH at 300 °C temperature in comparison to irregular particles.153 The c-WO3·0.5H2O demonstrated high photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of organic dyes and the elimination of hazardous substances, which is influenced by crystal water and also exhibits a long duration even after four cycles of photodegradation.144 From previous reports on WO3 nanomaterials, it can be summarized that hydrated WO3 (e.g., o-WO3·H2O, c-WO3·0.5H2O and m-WO3) may have superior photocatalytic properties, as compared with WO3 itself.144 The electrostatic attraction is responsible for MB adsorption, while the Pb2+ cations are adsorbed through electrostatic attraction and ion exchange. The maximum uptake capacities of the urchin-like WO3·0.33H2O for MB155 and Pb2+ are 247 and 249 mg g−1, respectively, and flower-like WO3·H2O are 118 and 315 mg g−1, respectively (Fig. 16(d–h)).147
According to the reports by Huang et al.,149 the WO3 microflowers exhibit a good response and reversibility to 100 ppm of some organic gases, such as toluene (16.7), acetone (17.4), ethanol (7.4), methanol (7.6) and n-butanol (5.9) at 320 °C as compared to WO3 square slabs. The gas diffusion process is directly related to the porosity and pore diameter of the nanomaterials. The flower-like 3-D WO3 film is recommended to allocate the fast diffusion of gas molecules as compare to square slabs, resulting in the high rates of gas adsorption and desorption. The thin thickness of the WO3 nanoplates and 3-D flower-like nanostructures result in a larger surface area, which could be considered as another contributor to the highly sensitive performance as a gas sensor.155 The nanorod-assembled sheet-flower of the WO3·H2O hierarchical architecture shows a higher gas response (fast gas diffusion speed) and lower operating temperature as compared to that of the rose-like, sphere-like and plate-flower, owing to their largest amount of thin petal structures and pores, thereby holding technological promise for fabricating an ethanol sensor.142,143
Enhanced isopropanol sensitivity and selectivity have been achieved due to the high porosity and large specific surface area provided by the combination of ultrasonic spray nozzle and microwave-assisted hydrothermal methods.158 WO3·2H2O possesses a structure formed from layers built up by the corner sharing WO5(H2O) octahedral units, and thus obtained stratified 2-D nanosheets. The confinement and quantization of the electrons and phonons, altering the photon–exciton conversion rate, the electron–phonon interaction behaviors and the free carrier lifetime make them promising candidates for electrochromic devices. In continuation to the above discussion, Li et al.161 prepared 3-D quasi-vertical WO3·2H2O nanosheet electrodes via electrodeposition technique, in which these were successfully assembled into an electrochromic device to exhibit reversible Li+ ion insertion and good electrochromic performance due to the large surface area and lamellar permeable spaces.

3.2. Nanorods and nanotubes
In earlier reports, the WO3 nanomaterials with nanorod and nanotube-based morphologies are showing less interest in the field of gas-sensing activity. Only a few reports are offered related to the gas-sensing properties, but it is fascinating to acquire well-defined WO3 nanorods and nanotubes for the purpose of studying their structures in correlation with their potential properties (Fig. 17 and 18).

3.2.1. Synthetic approaches. 
To date, several methods such as thermal evaporation, chemical vapor deposition, electro-spinning, sol–gel, chemical bath deposition, hydrothermal162,163 and template-directed synthesis have been used for the preparation of WO3 nanomaterials. All of these methods have certain limitations such as a high thermal budget, complicated processing technique, use of catalyst, long processing time, high cost, adaptability for mass production, unwanted byproducts and lastly not being environment-friendly. Among these methods, the sol–gel and chemical bath depositions are economical, low temperature, and mass production-worthy process. However, the sol–gel films create uncontrolled porosity, weak adhesion to substrate and unwanted cracks. On the other hand, the chemical bath deposition and hydrothermal methods produce unwanted byproducts after each deposition. There are only a few reports on the synthesis of WO3 nanostructures by cost-effective, and production worthy thermal oxidation technique, and thus more studies are needed on this method for different applications. In the continuation of this survey, a variety of immobilized WO3 nanostructures with urchin-like, nanowire arrays and nanowire clusters in H2O, EtOH and MeOH solvents, respectively, were successfully synthesized by solvothermal method.164 Yu et al.165 synthesized WO3 gas-sensing material by hydrothermal process in the presence of oxalic acid, exhibiting a belt-like surface morphology (Fig. 17(f)). Bai et al.166 synthesized WO3 nanorods (∼50 nm) via hydrothermal reaction at the temperature of 100 °C for 24 h using oxalic acid as the structure-directing template for controlling the size and shape of the crystal seeds, and ensuring the formation of uniform nanorods followed by crystal phase transition from m-WO3 to h-WO3 after calcination at 400 °C. By adjusting the amount of oxalic acid, the control of the precipitation between the WO42− and H+ ions is accomplished, which guaranteed the construction of uniform crystal seeds in strong acidic solution. The formation and growth process of the WO3 nanorods can be described by electroneutral and dehydration reactions (eqn (4)–(6)). WO42− + 2H+ + nH2O → H2WO4·nH2O(4) H2WO4·nH2O → WO3 (nuclei) + (n + 1)H2O(5) WO3 (nuclei) → WO3 (nanorods)(6)
High-performance 3D furball-like stainless-steel@WO3 electrodes (Fig. 17(g–i)) have been synthesized by hydrothermal method, and form the unique connected and quasi-connected WO3 networks.167 Thin films containing aligned or highly ordered WO3 nanorods were grown directly onto a tungsten metal plate via hydrothermal reaction in the presence of Cs2SO4.168 The sulfate salts of the alkali metal (e.g., NaHSO4, Na2SO4),168 d-block (e.g., FeSO4, CoSO4, CuSO4, ZnSO4), an alkaline earth metal (MgSO4)169 and a non-metal ((NH4)2SO4) act as structure-directing agents and were found to influence the shape, size and phase of the nanostructure when the WO3 nanostructures were directly grown on a tungsten plate via pH-dependent hydrothermal method. Additionally, chloride (e.g., MnCl2) and acetate (e.g., Zn(CH3COO)2) anion-based templates have also been employed to compare them with sulfate ions in order to elucidate the role of anions in the development of WO3 nanostructures. The WO3 samples exhibit h-WO3 nanorods at pH = 1 and c-WO3 with twin octahedral morphology at pH = 5.25.169 Nevertheless, the well-organized WO3 nanotube bundles have been fabricated by a superficial hydrothermal method by using NaHSO4 as a structure-directing agent in a mixture of ethylene glycol and water. The uniform WO3 nanotube bundles can be fabricated readily just via tuning the volume ratio of ethylene glycol and water. The concurrent use of HNO3 or HCl and sulphates (Na2SO4, (NH4)2SO4) for the purpose of attaining good morphology could complicate the reaction. Consequently, to obtain good morphology with excellent performance, it is more advantageous to utilize NaHSO4 than HNO3 or HCl, as NaHSO4 can not only supply both H+ and Na2SO4 altogether to accomplish the reaction, but also works as a structure-directing agent.170 Peng et al.171 fabricated WO3 with diverse morphologies and crystal phases via hydrothermal approach with different concentrations of sodium sulfate. The preferred growth face {[2 0 0] crystal plane} of h-WO3 could adsorb abundant Na+, which induced WO3 growing along the [0 0 1] crystal direction to form h-WO3 nanorods with diameters of 30–150 nm and lengths of 0.5–5 mm in the presence of 0.25 M Na2SO4, while excessive Na2SO4 led to a mixed crystal consisting of c-H2W2O7 and h-WO3. Qi et al.172 fabricated a 3-D hierarchical structure consisting of self-supported WO3 nanocolumn double-sided bundles via acid-supported (HCl) hydrothermal approach without any template, catalyst or substrate.173 The first report has been presented so far on proposing WO3 nanoporous networks by the self-assembly of WO3 nanorods via the effective utilization of the protonated urea174 or aniline and sodium sulfate175 as a novel nanostructure-directing mediator, under controlled pH conditions, calcination temperature and time. The h-WO3 nanorod thin films have been fabricated by utilizing ((NH3)2SO4) as a structure-directing agent with the assistance of carbon cloth, which behaves as a current collector, as well as an excellent scaffold for the direct growth.176 Navarro et al.177 fabricated WO3 nanorods by the self-assembly of highly crystalline nanowires under hydrothermal conditions using sodium tungstate as a precursor and either oxalic acid, citric acid,178p-aminobenzoic acid179 or poly(methacrylic acid) as a stabilizing agent. A decrease in the wire width and stacking effect was observed when the number of –COOH groups per capping agent was increased. Poly(methacrylic acid) allowed the stabilization of the structure into a single nanowire that tends to form coils. Zheng et al.180 synthesized uniform WO3 nanorod arrays (pH = 2.0), morphology change from WO3 nanorod bundles to separate nanorods (pH = 2.0 to 2.2), highly dense well-aligned WO3 nanorods (pH = 2.3 and 2.4), poorly crystalline and lightweight needle-like nanorods (pH = 2.5 and 2.6), amorphous WO3 (pH = 2.7), on indium tin oxide conducting substrates by using oxalic acid.
Apart from hydrothermal methods, other synthetic routes such as electrospinning181 followed by calcinations,182 magnetron sputtering with glancing-angle deposition183 and WO3 thin film deposited by normal sputtering process have been employed to fabricate well-organized WO3 nanomaterials. The resultant polycrystalline phase and porous nanorod network with very large effective surface area has been obtained by annealing at 400 and 500 °C.184 Nanorods were formed on tungsten, tantalum and copper substrates, with each grown along the [1 0 0] direction by pulsed laser deposition185 in a low background pressure of oxygen with variable morphologies. Nanorods formed on tungsten or tantalum substrates are short (100 s of nm in length) and display uniform cross-sections, while those grown on the copper substrate are typically longer, thicker, tapered, and display a branched, dendritic microstructure.186 Besides, the direct synthesis of highly crystalline single-phase h-WO3 nanorods by spray pyrolysis187 and controlled morphology (Fig. 17(a–c)) by adjusting the segregation time during reaction and by varying the amount of Pluronic P123 surfactant via a spray method188 have also been reported. Large-scale WO3 nanorods (diameter 20–50 nm, length 400–500 nm) and nanosheets (width 250–300 nm and thicknesses ∼15 nm) can be prepared by microwave irradiation method, using sodium tungstate dihydrate or tungstic acid as the tungsten source; CTAB and polyethylene glycol as the urfactant189 and oxalic acid190 as a structure-directing agent.


3.2.2. Properties and applications. 
In order to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency, the electrochemical performance for supercapacitors and lithium ion batteries,173 the catalyst should have a high specific surface area.190,191 Therefore, in recent years, the researchers have focused on studying novel nanomaterials, like nanotubes and nanorods, which possess a high surface-to-volume ratio, and thus increased photocatalytic effect. The superior electro-capacitive performance of the 3-D nanoporous network is attributed to the presence of a 3D surface heterostructure, facile diffusion of H+ ions through porous channels and enhanced electroactive surface area, resulting in improved electro-capacitive performance. The concept of utilizing protonated urea to synthesize multidimensional nanostructures of transition metal oxides without the need of hydrothermal or solvothermal treatment, will open up new routes to produce cost-effective electro-capacitive materials for device-scale applications.174 Layer-by-layer fabrication of hollow WO3 nanotubes functionalized with various catalysts leads to illustrate potential applications in lung cancer diagnosis and exhaled breath analysis for asthma.181 The WO3 nanowire arrays obtained in ethanol exhibited the highest photocatalytic efficiency178,192–194 for MB degradation (93.3% in 1 h under visible light) in wastewater treatment, mainly originated from the high crystallinity and strongest photocurrent, which benefit the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes. WO3 nanorods have been constructed using citric acid (0.2 mol) as a structure-directing agent, thus mentioned largest specific surface area (81.5 m3 g−1) and maximum dye adsorption performance (57.6 mg g−1 at pH = 7.0).178 The h-WO3 nanorods also exhibit a higher catalytic performance for the oxidation of cyclohexene to adipic acid (yield 79%) from the oxidation of cyclohexene.179 These nanowire arrays exhibited low electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, high peak current density, and efficient electron hole separation efficiency as compared to similar reports in the literature.164,177,195 The furball-like stainless-steel@WO3 electrode behaves as a powerful candidate for supercapacitor applications, as well as it has a good potential for environmentally benign, cost-effective and high performance energy storage devices.167 A tapered microfiber interferometer coated by WO3 nanorods has been fabricated via flame melting biconical taper method. Owing to the large surface area of the WO3 nanorods, it has a strong adsorption capacity and good selectivity for ammonia. Moreover, it has good prospects in the biological fields such as environmental gas monitoring and gas leakage monitoring in chemical plants.196 WO3 nanotubes have a potential for practical application as a gas sensor for different concentrations of gases (Fig. 18(a–c)), including nitrogen dioxide,172,188,197,198 acetone, ethanol, methanol, ammonia,185 hydrogen, benzene, hexane, carbon monoxide and butane.163,182 In addition, the transitory stability of the WO3 sensor even after five cycles of switching on/off from air-to-gas expressed effectual reusability of the gadget.199
However, in some reports, the WO3 nanorod-based sensor showed high selectivity towards NO2 gas (116% of 10 ppm NO2 at 225 °C) over H2S, NH3, acetone, methanol, and ethanol.183 When the concentration of ethanol increased from 0 ppm to 20000 ppm, the peak surface photovoltage value decreased from 0.0365 mV to 0.0012 mV, showing good sensitivity to high concentrations of ethanol for the WO3 nanobelt-based photoelectric sensor.165 NO2 sensing (144–1054% response to 1–50 ppm of NO2 at 300 °C) of the WO3 nanorods might be due to the higher surface-to-volume ratio.200 After the calcination process (600 °C for 4 h), the obtained WO3 nanorods exhibited a high response (209 to 10 ppm NO2 at 200 °C).166 In addition, the WO3 nanorod annealed at 500 °C exhibited an optimum response of ∼27 to 2.0 ppm of NO2 at 250 °C.184 The WO3 nanotube bundle sensor displayed significantly better sensing performance for 100 ppm of ethanol than many reported WO3 materials by using ethylene glycol during the reaction. Ethylene glycol can enhance the concentration of the oxygen vacancies due to its reduction properties.170 WO3-based gas sensors exhibit high selectivity to H2S, which are attributed to the strong interaction between the lone pair electrons of sulfur atoms and oxygen vacancy, as well as the adsorbed oxygen of the nanomaterials. The high sensitivity of the WO3-based sensors have been demonstrated for detecting dimethyl trisulfide, the biomarker of Listeria monocytogenes (known as food-borne pathogen) with rapid response (10 s) and high response (94) behavior.162

3.3. Nanowires and nanofibers

3.3.1. Synthetic approaches. 
Similar to the above discussed synthetic methods, nanofibers and nanowires (Fig. 19(a)) are prepared by various synthetic methods such as simple hydro/solvo-thermal, microwave-assisted,201 vapor transport,202 hot-wire chemical vapor deposition,203 and electrospinning method204 with or without using a template or structure-directing agents205 and flexible carbon cloth.206 Szabó et al.207 fabricated h-WO3 nanowire bundles via simple hydrothermal method by using Na2WO4 as a precursor and Na2SO4 as the structure-directing agent. These nanowires were successfully decorated with metal nanoparticles by wet impregnation to form metal nanoparticle–WO3 nanowire composites and using different metal precursors (e.g., silver-nitrate, gold chloride, diamminedichloropalladium, tetraamineplatinum nitrate and nickel acetylacetonate), resulting in different particle sizes and coverage on the surface. Cui et al.208 synthesized WO3 nanofibers by electrospinning technology, in which the calcination temperature, precursor content, holding time and heating rate cause an effect on the morphology of the nanofibers to make them continuous and uniform. Different heating rates caused no significant influence on the crystallinity of WO3 nanofibers, but also affected the photoelectrochemical performances. Hieu et al.209 fabricated a large-scale porous nanowire-like structure of WO3 by the deposition of tungsten metal on the substrate of porous single-wall carbon nanotube film, followed by thermal oxidation process. Meng et al.210 fabricated a sequence of 3-D WO3 microfibers with controlled morphology (i.e., nanoparticles and/or microplates) by using cotton as a template. Meng et al.211 fabricated WO3 nanofibers from mixtures of AMT hydrate and polyvinyl alcohol using an electrospinning technique. After calcinations (at 500 °C for 2 h), the m-WO3 nanofibers were obtained. A low concentration of AMT was used during the reaction, leading to the formation of WO3 nanofibers with a large area of monocrystalline structure. Higher concentrations resulted in polycrystalline nanofibers with joined nanoparticles along the fiber axis. Zeb et al.206 fabricated ultrathin walled WO3 nanotubes in the presence of K2SO4 and citric acid under mild conditions, whereas WO3 nanowires with a diameter of 10 to 15 nm, have been fabricated by using only K2SO4.

3.3.2. Properties and applications. 
Nanowires and nanofibers exhibit various applications in the fields of NO2,202,212,213 NH3,209,214 ethanol215 sensing, electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction in both acidic and neutral electrolytes, and photocatalytic/photoelectrochemical performance201 for organic dye absorption (Fig. 19(b) and 20(a–f)). Leng et al.204 fabricated WO3 nanofibers via electrospinning method, which were used as NH3 sensors with 5.5 of the high responses, and the response and recovery times are 1 and 5 s, respectively, for 100 ppm NH3 at 500 °C.204 Uniform h-WO3 nanowires (diameter of 5–10 nm) with a high aspect ratio and specific surface area of 625 and 139 m2 g−1, respectively,216 are represented to show the electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction from water.217 The hierarchical WO3 dendrite-based sensors are highly sensitive, selective and stable at the low optimal operating temperature of 140 °C. They had a low detection limit (200 ppb), and fast response and recovery (7 s and 12 s to 5 ppm NO2).218 They performed as supercapacitor electrodes, and illustrated elevated discharge capacitance and cyclic stability.219 The high surface area of the h-WO3 nanotubes with 71.95 m2 g−1 promotes the excellent sensitivity towards ethanol and acetone.206

3.4. Nanosheets and nanoplates

3.4.1. Synthetic approaches. 
Over the past few decades, attempts have been made to synthesize many binary oxides on the nanoscale, although many routes are time consuming, energy demanding, and require a post-synthetic thermal dealing to accomplish a crystalline stage with controlled morphology and increased particle size. To avoid these drawbacks, a known microwave-assisted synthesis of crystalline m-WO3 nanoparticles in benzyl alcohol solvent has been followed. In the proposed mechanism during the microwave-hydrothermal process, Na2WO4·2H2O reacted with citric acid (C6H8O7·H2O) to form WO3 molecules, which nucleated and grew as WO3 nanoplates (eqn (7)). 2Na2WO4·2H2O + 2C6H8O7·H2O → 2WO3 + 2C6H6O7Na2·H2O + 6H2O(7)Initially, the nanoplates were irregular and became rectangular as the processing time was lengthened.220 The nanoplates formed in different sizes are controlled by the initiation of the nuclei, aging time, growth rate, and surrounding concentration. Wang et al.221 fabricated WO3 porous nanosheets arrays via in situ deposition on the Al2O3 substrate in a chemical bath at 60 °C. The hydrotungstite phase is decomposed at an annealing temperature of 150 °C, while the phase transformation from tungstite to m-WO3 takes place at 200 °C. Surfactants (such as cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide222) and organic acids (such as p-nitrobenzoic acid, oxalic acid223) as a structure-directing agent or template can affect the phase purity of the WO3 nanoplates and nanorods. During the fabrication of WO3 nanoplates using p-nitrobenzoic acid, there exists a dynamic equilibrium (WO3 ↔ (WOx)n−) between the WO3 solid and the soluble species of polytungstate or metatungstate. The solubility of WO3 has increased with increasing pH value of the solution mixture. When the reaction system cooled down, the soluble p-nitrobenzoic acid will precipitate again and the pH value may increase, which in turn causes the nanoplate to be partially etched, and the incomplete nanoplates are finally obtained.224 The product synthesized under an ammonium nitrate-free condition has the pure crystalline phase of o-WO3·0.33H2O, and after increasing the amount of ammonium nitrate to the solution, the m-WO3 phase started to form and became the pure m-WO3 phase. The morphology of m-WO3 was a nanoplate, and became a nanorod after the addition of polyethylene glycol.225 The WO3·H2O nanoplates with variable sizes, morphologies and preferred orientation were also prepared by manipulation in the acidity of the Na2WO4·2H2O solution and converted into m-WO3 nanoplates by heat treatment.226 The plate-like WO3 photo-electrode with controlled surface oxygen vacancies227 has been fabricated via H2O2 treatment method for the first time so far.228 In another report, WO3 nanoplates could be obtained by the two different topochemical transformation methods. The first method is the hydrothermal treatment of tungstic acid nanoplates at the temperature above 160 °C, and the second one is calcination at higher temperatures in air. Fluoroboric acid (HBF4) provides an acid source, and also acts as a structure-directing agent throughout the synthetic process of the H2WO4 nanoplates in the solution phase.229 Sometimes, the fabrication of WO3 nanosheets took place via surfactant-free hydrothermal method with a possible growth mechanism proposed by adjusting the dosage of Na2SO4 and pH (by using HCl or HNO3) of the reaction mixture.230 The 3-D hollow spherical structure of the WO3 nanoplates have been fabricated by regulating the HNO3 concentration. The product has switched from WO3·0.33H2O to m-WO3·H2O at higher HNO3 concentration, as well as particle size. Thus, the morphology changed from micro-scale spheres to nanoplates. In the WO3·H2O plate-like structure, the H2O molecules joined together via hydrogen bond and WO3 bonds with other WO3 molecules, and finally form a water ball structure. During subsequent drying, WO3·H2O is deprived of crystal water to become m-WO3, remaining this hollow spherical structure.231 Jia et al.232 conducted an extra cleaning process before hydrothermal synthesis to remove the residual ions in the precursor solution around the H2WO4 colloids and the resulting thinner WO3 nanoplates. With the decrease of the average thickness of WO3, the specific capacitance increases and simultaneously exhibits outstanding electrochemical stability and good cycle stability. Subsequently, the H2WO4 colloids were immersed into NaCl solution with different contents, and the thickness of the WO3 nanoplates was increased. Intriguingly, the residual ions can promote the growth of the WO3 nanosheets along the direction of the thickness. The porous ultrathin WO3 nanoplate arrays with amorphous layers and highest photocurrent density were prepared by using (NH4)2C2O4. With increasing concentration of (NH4)2C2O4, the morphologies of WO3 turned into a plate-like nanostructure with reduced thickness.233


3.4.2. Properties and applications. 
The superior photocatalytic performance of the WO3 nanosheets, as compared to WO3 nanorods, towards toxic organic dye solutions (methylene blue, eosin red and congo-red) could be due to the high crystallinity and more active surface for the interaction and degradation of the dye molecules.231 Compared with the industry-use catalyst of Degussa, P25, TiO2, WO3 exhibits magnificent photocatalytic activity for the oxidation of primary alcohols234 and acetone sensing222–225 due to the plate-like or sheet-like morphology and porous structure.231 It is worth mentioning that the gas-sensing activity can be improved by doping, and with an increase of the responsive surface areas of the substances. In redox sensors, the substances will afford additional surface sites for the absorption of, and thus to make contact with the surrounding gases. The WO3 nanosheets show high sensing performance to humidity with 98% sensitivity, fast response (25 s) and elevated strength as compared to WO3 nanorods.189 Porous WO3 nanosheets with ultra-thin thickness (20 nm) display improved NO2 sensing activity at low temperature with high response of 460 toward 10 ppm NO2. The temperature-dependant gas response to NO2 is interpreted by the competitive adsorption of oxygen and NO2 at low temperature and desorption at high temperature.221,226,229 The NO2 gas molecules adsorbed at the terminal oxygen site of WO3 leads to the introduction of new surface states, which is responsible for the intrinsic NO2 sensing properties.235 Ultrathin 2-D WO3 nanosheets with controlled oxygen vacancies have outstanding selectivity to NO2 against other gases (e.g., C2H5OH, CO, H2 and NH3) and environmental issues (e.g., CO2 and moisture), and show high response (5.67) for 50 ppb nitrogen dioxide at 140 °C.236 Gao et al.237 fabricated t-WO3 nanoplates with prominent cyclohexene sensing and photocatalytic degradation of MB. The nanostructured m-WO3 nanorods showed much higher electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution from water than the commercial bulk m-WO3.227 The 2-D ultra-thin WO3 nanosheets were fabricated via a Pluronic P123-induced self-assembly method, and have shown remarkably enhanced xylene sensing performance and methyl orange photocatalytic degradation performance, which could be ascribed to the high percentage of reactive [0 0 2] crystal facets and high specific surface area (121 m2 g−1).238 The plate-like WO3 photo-electrode with different concentrations of surface oxygen vacancies were fabricated via H2O2 treatment method, and can be used as a promising candidate for photoelectrochemical water splitting reactions in comparison with the pristine WO3 platelet.228

3.5. Nanoflowers and nanoflakes

3.5.1. Synthetic approaches. 
Hierarchical WO3 flower-like spheres have assembled into sheet-like structures via a facile sonochemical strategy by using H2O2 (for acidic environment and hydroxyl radicals), and followed by the calcination process.239 Huang et al.240 fabricated nanoflake-based flower-like and hollow microsphere-like WO3·H2O architectures by acidic precipitation of different concentrations of Na2WO4 solution with mild temperatures without any surfactants, followed by calcination at 450 °C. In another report by Huang et al.,241 flower-like assemblies of m-WO3 (side length 50–150 nm, thickness 25 nm) were fabricated by the hydrothermal reaction of PbWO4 in the presence of 15 M HNO3 solution. Novel loosely and tightly arranged nanosheet assembled flower-like WO3 nanostructures242 based on ammonium oxalate were controllably synthesized via a facile hydrothermal approach at different temperatures. A phase transformation was conquered from o-WO3·0.33H2O to m-WO3 by increasing the hydrothermal growth temperature from 100 to 180 °C.243 The WO3 flower-like architectures were also synthesized by hydrothermal process using tungstate dihydrate as a tungsten source and citric acid as an assistant244 agent, or NaHSO4 as a capping agent. While using NaHSO4, alcohol is constructed in the form of the 3D flower-like WO3 materials with hierarchical structures. In addition, SO42− ions inhibited the growth rate in the thickness direction of the nanosheets. The 3-D hierarchical WO3 nanostructure with a novel nanosheet assembled morphology was synthesized through pretreatment or acidification of Na2WO4·2H2O with concentrated HCl for 24 h, which plays a crucial factor in order to obtain the flower-like nanostructures.245 The flower-like WO3 were also self-assembled by many ultrathin petal-like nanosheets with thicknesses of several nanometers, and exhibit high response and good selectivity to ethanol, which might substantially benefit from their layer-by-layer ultrathin petal structure.246 The WO3 nanoflakes were grown directly on a seed layer-free Al2O3 substrate by simple hydrothermal method with optimized conditions.247 Well-aligned WO3 nanoflake arrays as an effective photoanode has been vertically fabricated through a facile hydrothermal process in the presence of polyethylene glycol on pre-annealed thin-layer tungsten sheet, which provided a strong connection between the growing WO3 nanomaterials and substrate.248 The quasi 2-D sub-stoichiometric WO3 fabricated by two-step sol–gel-exfoliation–intercalation process and further calcination and exfoliation processes comprising large adjoining nanoflakes.249


3.5.2. Properties and applications. 
Hierarchical WO3 flower-like spheres are assembled by loosely connected sheet-like structures, which is convenient for the diffusion of some volatile organics such as acetone, ethanol, and inorganic molecules such as NH3,247 HCN and NO2,244,245 NO (response time 4.5 s to 97 ppm NOx), and the maximum utilization of sensing materials. Hierarchical WO3 flower-like spheres with a layer-by-layer ultrathin petal structure promote the active surface reactions, as well as show an ultrafast response time of 3 s to 10 ppm triethylamine at 205 °C,239 and a fast response and recovery to ethanol at 300–350 °C.246 The loosely-arranged WO3 flower-like nanostructures and hollow porous microspheres240,241 possess an abundance of semi-closed spaces with larger specific surface area. Thus, they exhibited superior photocatalytic property for the decomposition of RhB and improved NH3-sensing properties as compared to the tightly-arranged WO3 nanostructures. This phenomenon is attributed to the following reasons: for the loosely-arranged WO3 nanostructures, (i) the loose distribution of the nanosheets forms an abundance of semi-closed spaces, limiting the release and flow of the target gas; (ii) a larger specific surface area provides a greater amount of adsorption sites; and (iii) more nanosheets intersect to form more nanojunctions that facilitate electron transfer.242 A facile, efficient plasma treatment surface modification strategy has been reported in the literature for improving the photoelectrochemical properties of the WO3 nanoflakes on FTO (fluorine-tin oxide) substrates. It is found that Argon plasma treatment not only produces a higher surface area, but also enriches the oxygen vacancies on the WO3 surface. The enhanced performance can be ascribed to the abundant pore structures on the nanoflakes and enriched oxygen vacancies, which improves the WO3 bulk conductivity and simultaneously provides the much-increased surface-active sites, the enlarged surface area of the solid–liquid interface and the increased charge carrier density. This mild strategy provides an efficient, sustainable method for developing high-performance photoelectrocatalysts based on nanostructured semiconducting metal oxides for solar water splitting233 and the water evolution process.250

3.6. Nanoparticles

3.6.1. Synthetic approaches. 
In the literature, nanoparticles (hollow sphere, square-like, m-WO3 and h-WO3) have been synthesized using different approaches such as hydrothermal,251 microwave-assisted hydrothermal,252 chemical solution deposition,253 citric acid-assisted precipitation,254 ultrasonic spray pyrolysis255 and sol–gel method followed by calcinations.256 The influence of acidic pH and the importance of various additives (e.g., CH3COOH, NaClO4 and Na2SO4) have been inspected for the fabrication of m-WO3via hydrothermal approach. Using Na2SO4 led to the formation of nanosheets with a cubic phase, while the presence of citric acid together with sodium sulfate in the reaction produced h-WO3 nanorods.257 For instance, the samples obtained at pH = 0.1 were well crystallized m-WO3, which are independent of temperature and the presence of any additives. At 180 °C and 200 °C, applying CH3COOH and NaClO4 resulted in nanosheets that were similar in size. With Na2SO4, the additive at 180 °C resulted in sheets. However, the additive at 200 °C resulted in sheets and rods, indicating that SO42− was a capping agent only at 200 °C.258 The nanosized h-WO3 can also be synthesized by the annealing of hexagonal ammonium tungsten bronze with the help of stabilizing ions or molecules in the hexagonal channels.259 In some reports, the addition of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate was employed to manage the uniform development of the H2WO4 nucleus with rose-like morphology by chemical bath deposition, and followed afterward by the annealing process.260 Fluoroboric acid (HBF4) has considerable persuasion on the phase transformation from t-WO3 → m-WO3 with variable morphology from thin plate to cuboid, followed by intermediate metastable h-WO3.261 A solvent-regulated, surfactant-free hydrothermal process was conducted at 180 °C for 24 h to synthesize WO3 nanocrystals with various morphologies (urchin-like, rod-like and plate-like) using WCl6 as a precursor, and just changing the solvents (from ethanol, ethanol/water to water). Then, those WO3 nanocrystals were used as the active materials to fabricate gas sensors.262 The optimized hydrothermal precursor including malic acid could be dehydrated to the mixed composition of h-WO3 and m-WO3 with unique sphere-like porous architecture after being annealed at 400 °C.263


3.6.2. Properties and applications. 
In the reported literature, WO3 nanoparticles show photocatalytic and electrochromic applications264 such as the degradation of phenols,265 degradation of Lidocaine (prevalent positional anesthetic drug and found in aqueous environments as a pollutant),266 photoelectrochemical water splitting,267 microsensors to detect gases and volatiles255,263 such as NO2, H2, CO, NH3, actetone, ethanol and relative humidity,268 degradation of organic dyes,269 and high-lithium storage batteries with good cyclability.270 The ion intercalation ability at the vacancies between the oxygen and tungsten bonds exhibit the changes in the visible color and transparency of the material with respect to the intercalation of small cations such as H+, Li+ or Na+, identified as electrochromic properties. The WO3 hollow sphere photocatalyst exhibited higher photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of RhB (92.78%), 1.54 and 2.11 times greater than the WO3 nanoflakes and nanosheets, respectively. The hollow sphere-like WO3 nanostructures showed higher degradation efficiency and reusability for five consecutive run without any activity loss.271 The photocatalytic activity of WO3 was obtained for the sequence of degradation of the organic dyes, as follows: indigo carmine (IC) > rhodamine B (RhB) > methyl orange (MO) > Congo red (CR).254 Oxidized m-WO3 has been reported as the most active photocatalyst both in gas and liquid phases. The oxidized h-WO3 got second place in activity, whereas the reduced h-WO3 and m-WO3 have much lower activity. The oxidized m-WO3 always has a completely oxidized structure. In contrast, the oxidized h-WO3 is always in a slightly reduced state, as it contains trace amounts of NH4+ (or alkaline) ions, which are necessary to stabilize the structure. It has also been proposed that c-WO3 is even more metastable than h-WO3, since it has a 3-D channel system along its structure. Therefore, c-WO3 can also be in a somewhat reduced state like h-WO3, and also shows lower photocatalytic activity than the fully oxidized m-WO3.272

3.7. Micro-, meso- and macroporous tungsten oxides (WO3)
From the last few years, 3-D nanostructures with multifaceted morphology and high dimensionality (Fig. 21) have attracted remarkable research attention due to the fact that their eccentric geometric organization and atom array on the unambiguous facets of these nanostructures can proffer novel properties. The self-assembly process for the fabrication of the 3-D nanostructure strategy (Fig. 21(a)), especially under low temperature solution environment, where low-dimensional building units instinctively aggregate into high-dimensional architectures, is probably the most attractive approach. Beknalkar et al.273 fabricated an exotic 3-D polycrystalline m-WO3 microflower via economical and environmentally friendly hydrothermal approach. The potassium hydroxide acts as a structure-directing agent, and plays a vital role in altering the morphology of the nanostructures from 2-D nanosheets to 3-D microflowers. The 3-D microflowers made up of 2-D multi-directional dendritic nanoplates are highly promising for applications as gas sensors. Han et al.274 reported the synthesis of hierarchical carpet-like WO3 microflower-based sensor, which exhibits much higher sensitivity to low concentration of NO2 (10 ppm) than to other high concentrations of gases (1000 ppm), indicating its excellent gas sensing selectivity. Mehta et al.275 synthesized nanobricks and nanosheets, and assembled WO3 microflowers (3 to 7 μm diameter and thickness ranging from 30 to 100 nm) hydrothermally using potassium sulfate and oxalic acid as active surface agents for the modification of the morphology and size. Their sensor achieves its maximum sensitivity (72%) towards ethanol vapor (1 ppm at 250 °C). Rakibuddin et al.276 synthesized highly crystalline WO3 particles by thermal annealing of tungsten powder without toxic precursors or additional capping agents, and the resultant surface area and pore size of the synthesized WO3 decreases with increasing annealing temperatures. Ren et al.277 executed the single-step fabrication of electrochromic WO3 micro-patterned films by utilizing photosensitive sol–gel route, in which tungsten chloride and benzoylacetone act as the precursor and chemical modifier, respectively. Tong et al.278 fabricated hollow WO3 microspheres from primary nanoplate clusters (50 nm) via one-pot solvothermal route. These materials show superior lithium ion battery anode performance due to its high conductivity, high density, enhanced safety and high theoretical capacity. Further studies have proved that the incorporation of highly conductive carbon into the electrode materials has enhanced the electrochemical performance. For instance, the WO3 nanomaterial arrays on carbon cloth delivered higher charge/discharge capacities than unadulterated WO3. Moreover, if the content of the carbon is very high, the specific capacity and density of the total electrode will be much lower than the theoretical values of WO3. Thus, new approaches for the synthesis of WO3 without carbon or with a controlled amount of carbon material are highly desired to enhance the electrochemical performance.

Xu et al.279 fabricated WO3 mesoscopic microspheres self-assembled by nanofibers in the presence of H2O2, which display excellent electrochemical performance with a maximum energy density (97.61 W h kg−1) and power density (of 28.01 kW kg−1). You et al.280 synthesized nanosheet-assembled hierarchical WO3 hollow microspheres (pore size distributions from 1 nm to 170 nm) by sintering the acid-treated CaWO4 hollow microsphere precursor, which exhibited excellent sensing properties to NO2 (29–400 ppb NO2 at room temperature and about 16–40 ppb NO2 at 75 °C). There is still an exigent issue to attain the high gas response to the low concentration of NO2 at a reduced temperature because the adsorption, desorption and diffusion of NO2 are sluggish on the surface of WO3 nanoparticles. However, the hierarchical and hollow metal oxides with thin shell layers are also very attractive to achieve a high surface area with a less- or non-agglomerated form for WO3 nanoparticles. Zhai et al.281 fabricated 3-D hollow WO3 microspheres by the gathering of single-crystalline nanosheets by the solvothermal approach at low-temperature, followed by annealing. These hollow WO3 microspheres behave as sensors to exhibit high selectivity and short response time (∼1.5 s towards 50 ppm triethylamine at 220 °C), which is better than almost all of the reported TEA recognizing sensors to date. Zhao et al.282 synthesized WO3 micro/nanostructures by paper-assisted calcination method, and their morphology can be varied by adding inorganic ions (e.g., ZnCl2 or K2SO4), thus forming m-WO3 nanoparticles, m/h-WO3 hollow microsphere and m-WO3/WO3·0.33H2O nanorods. The WO3 hollow microspheres possessed more oxygen vacancies and surface area, better photon utilization, easier exciting/transporting of the charge carriers and lower recombination rate of electron–hole pairs, resulting in visible-light-driven superior photocatalytic abilities.
Mesoporous architectures of photoanodes have promising applications in solar energy conversion. However, particularly in the case of WO3, high crystallinity is needed for a photoelectrochromic performance as a photoanode. Chandra et al.283 fabricated mesoporous crystalline WO3 by surfactant-thermal-carbonization synthetic approach by using series of 2-(alkylaminomethyl)pyridine (PAL2-n, n = 8, 12 and 16) surfactants as templates. As the alkyl chain length of the templates increased, this enabled the stabilization of the organized mesoporous structure of WO3 and thickened the pore-walls at high temperature by providing a carbon support inside the pores through carbonization. In general, it is possible to further increase the surface area with shortened chain length of surfactant. The performances of the photoelectrochromic water oxidation were 4.7–6.3 times enhanced by the mesoporous structure for the WO3/PAL2-n samples, compared to the WO3/untemplate samples.284 Actually, the increase of the surface area and the introduction of the mesopores raise the amount of O2−(hν) and the target gas adsorbed on the surface of the sensing material, and provide more reacting positions. The increase of absorbance to visible light improves the utilization of light energy, resulting in more O2−(hν) produced. Consequently, the sensing properties of the mesoporous WO3 are greatly enhanced. At first, the formaldehyde is converted to the formate species chemisorbed on the WO3 surface by the photoinduced oxygen ions [O2−(hν)] (eqn (8)), and then the formate species are converted to CO2 and H2O by O2−(hν) (eqn (9)). O2−(hν) + HCHO → −O−HC−O− (intermediate product) + H2O + e−(8) O2−(hν) + −O−HC−O− (intermediate product) → CO2 + H2O + e−(9)
Farjood et al.285 reported the template-free fabrication of mesoporous WO3 (19 nm pore diameter and 67 m2 g−1 surface area), which is transformed from h-WO3 to t-WO3 crystalline phase after heating above 250 °C. The h-WO3 is capable of removing more than 60 mg g−1 of MB solution in the presence of H2O2 under the irradiation of visible light within a very short time. The highly ordered mesoporous WO3 film has synthesized by employing a template-assisted peroxopolytungstic acid sol–gel method,286 and applied for the first time in a gasochromic smart window to date. Hilliard et al.287 fabricated a mesoporous WO3 thin film from the sol–gel dip coating approach, and the resultant substance appears to be a promising candidate as a low cost photoanode for use in photoelectrochemical water splitting technologies. Li et al.288 reported on mesoporous WO3 with “reinforced-concrete”-like structures with a mesopore size of 5.8–15.8 nm and high surface area of 128 m2 g−1. They have a unique semiconducting property for host–guest interaction and ultrasensitive gas sensing performance toward H2S with a rapid response (3 s) and recovery (14 s) even at low concentration (0.2 ppm). Teoh et al.289 reported on the mesoporous WO3 thin film composed of nano-sized grains with 143 m2 g−1 surface area after being calcined at 250 °C, and possessed sensitivity properties towards the NO2 gas sensor. Villa et al.290 reported on the mesoporous WO3 (surface area 151 m2 g−1) photocatalyst for the partial oxidation of methane to methanol using electron scavengers (Fe3+, Cu2+, Ag+) and H2O2 species. Yue et al.291 reported on mesoporous WO3 by using aminosilylized 3-D mesoporous SBA-15 as a template, in which hexagonally ordered nanorods were linked by nanosized bridges to form 3-D open framework. Zhu et al.292 synthesized mesoporous WO3 through a ligand-assisted solvent evaporation provoked co-assembly process with the help of the diblock copolymer [poly(ethylene oxide)-block-polystyrene] as a structure-directing agent (Fig. 22(a)). These nanomaterials form a crystalline framework for the highly sensitive and selective detection of foodborne pathogens (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes).
 Fig. 22  Schematic illustration of the formation of ordered mesoporous WO3 materials via the solvent evaporation induced co-assembly approach. Adapted with permission from ref. 292, (Copyright 2017 American Chemical Society). 
Only a few examples related to the macroporous WO3 particles are reported in the literature to date. Nandiyanto et al.293 reported on the one-step production of spherical macroporous WO3 particles with controllable pore size and particle outer diameter (from 0.3 to 2 μm) by using a spray-pyrolysis method, in which ammonium tungsten pentahydrate (ATP) as a tungsten source and polystyrene (PS) spheres as a colloidal template have been used. The surface charge, size, and concentration of the colloidal nanoparticles for highly ordered porous film and particles have been investigated (Fig. 21(e and f)). The porous morphology and particle outer diameter (from smallest engineered porous silica nanoparticles to micrometer-sized particles) were controlled by adjusting the PS/ATP mass ratio and precursor concentration, respectively. For instance, the PS/ATP mass ratio of 0.60 provided WO3 particles with a photocatalytic rate that was 2.5 times that of the dense WO3 particles. Mehta et al.294 fabricated macroporous WO3 with different morphologies (nanorods, nanoplates, nanosheets and microflowers) using glycine (gly) as a structure-assisting agent via facile hydrothermal route. The highest surface area was obtained for the microflower morphology (76.43 cm2 g−1), which displayed the highest selectivity (83.87% at scarcely 10 ppm gas conc.) for the acetone gas sensor. The pseudomorphic transformation of the 3-D ordered macroporous WO3 into a nanostructured macroporous tungsten carbide (WC) has been performed by Rong et al.233 because of their advantages in catalytic/electrocatalytic applications. Tungsten carbides are low-cost substitutes for precious metal catalysts in the dehydrogenation process, isomerization of 2,2-dimethylpropane to 2-methylbutane, hydrogenolysis of n-alkanes, electrocatalysis of CH3OH, H2O, and CO.
4. Conclusion and perspective
This review summarizes recent progress in the rapidly developing field of paradodecatungstate polyoxoanion-based crystalline materials with miscellaneous structural types, assorted nuclearities, their fabrication via different effective synthetic approaches (e.g., one-pot reaction, stepwise synthetic strategy, metal-directing or pH-controlled self-assembly). Unlike the habitually scrutinized Keggin-type anions, the para A anion consists of a central oxygen atom that is common in three WO6 octahedra and is not connected to a tetrahedrally arranged heteroatom, but the middle cavity contains two protons. The para B anion is located on an inversion center and consists of two types of trimetallic units, i.e., open {W3O13} and typical {W3O14} units. Two typical and two open trimers gathered around a central cavity, which consists of two disordered protons. Paradodecatungstate clusters have been further used to fabricate tungsten carbide (WC), tungsten nitride (WNx), tungsten trioxide (WO3) and their hydrate-based nanomaterials with controlled morphology via systematically introduced variable synthetic approaches. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the developments over the past several decades, as well as recent trends of WO3-based nanomaterials. These nanomaterials with controlled morphology have many advantages due to their large effective surface area (provides more active sites for the reaction between the absorbed oxygen and target gas molecules), which could find promising applications in the field of sensing, rapid diffusion of pollutant molecules in nanotube/nanoporous structure, enhancement of photocatalytic activity, photodegradation of organics, treatment of heavy metals, air purification, self-cleaning, CO2 photoreduction, hydrogen evolution from water splitting and disinfection of bacteria. This article provides an overview of recent progress on the fundamental structures and properties of the broad family of WO3 based materials, and the latest development of utilizing them in various applications and technical challenges, with a specific interest in the construction of gas sensors and photocatalytic/photodegradation agents. The 3-D flower-like hierarchical WO3·H2O exhibits superior selectivity and higher response to Pb2+, ethanol and NO2 than low dimensional structures. For the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB), the urchin-like o-WO3·0.33H2O and WO3·0.5H2O exhibit maximum adsorption capacities as compared to h-WO3. It can be summarized that an increase of the surface-to-volume ratio of a photocatalyst is one of the effective ways to increase the photocatalytic efficiency. Therefore, various 1-D nanostructured WO3 such as nanorods, nanofibers and nanotubes, as well as 2-D nanosheets (flake-shaped with flat and smooth surface and extremely small thickness) have been fabricated for best photocatalytic application.
