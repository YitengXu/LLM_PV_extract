    , Accepted 19th August 2016First published on 19th August 2016AbstractMethylammonium lead bromide nanoparticles are synthetized with a new ligand (11-aminoundecanoic acid hydrobromide) by a non-template method. Upon dispersion in toluene they show a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield of 80%. In addition, the bifunctional ligand allows anchoring of the nanoparticles on a variety of conducting and semiconducting surfaces, showing bright photoluminescence with a quantum yield exceeding 50%. This opens a path for the simple and inexpensive preparation of multilayer light-emitting devices.
Recently, organic inorganic (hybrid) lead halide perovskites have been widely studied for photovoltaic applications, where power conversion efficiencies exceeding 22.1% have been demonstrated.1,2 Beyond solar cells, these materials are interesting candidates for low-threshold lasers and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).1,3–7 Their application in LEDs requires a precise control over their morphology, since this determines their optical and electronic properties.8,9 In particular, materials with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) are desirable for the preparation of efficient LEDs. One of the most suitable strategies for controlling the morphology and enhancing the photoluminescence of perovskites is the preparation of nanostructured materials. In nanostructured perovskites, the spatial confinement of the charge carriers together with a passivation of the surface states result in a substantial increase of the luminescence yield when compared to bulk perovskites.10 The recent breakthroughs in the PLQY of narrow-band emitting perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) (full width at half-maximum, FWHM, ∼20 nm) make these materials promising candidates for light-emitting applications.11,12 Perovskite NPs can be prepared by a direct, non-template method that makes use of organic ligands to disperse the material in the form of colloidal NPs.13 These organic capping ligands are usually medium or long chain alkyl ammonium halides that limit the growth of the material in the three dimensions. Schmidt et al. reported, for the first time, the synthesis of 6 nm sized methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) colloidal perovskite NPs using octadecylammonium as the capping ligand.13 Thin films obtained by spin-coating the NP dispersion showed intense photoluminescence (PL) with an associated quantum yield of about 20%. Through modified synthetic conditions, the same group later showed that surface states could be further passivated by insertion of a complementary weak Lewis base, and PLQYs up to 82% in solution were achieved.14 Recently, color tunable mixed halide perovskite NPs with PLQY in solution up to 93% have been demonstrated.11 Interestingly, the NP size was found to be strongly dependent on the synthesis temperature, giving an additional degree of freedom in the material design while, at the same time, underlining the difficulties in achieving reproducible preparation of monodisperse hybrid perovskite NPs. The elimination of polar solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF) during synthesis has been shown to substantially improve the nucleation and growth of MAPbBr3 NPs.15 In general, however, the PLQY decreases substantially when the nanoparticles are processed into thin films, due to unavoidable aggregation of the material.10 In spite of such reduction of the PLQY, these films have been recently used to prepare LEDs.16–19 Encouraging brightness and external quantum efficiencies have been shown, further demonstrating the potential of this type of material in lighting and display applications.
In this work, we describe the preparation of highly photoluminescent MAPbBr3 NP thin-films, through a temperature-independent synthesis which makes use of a bifunctional ligand (11-aminoundecanoic acid hydrobromide, Br−NH3+-C10-COOH). This molecule efficiently coordinates the NPs and, at the same time, allows selective anchoring of the NPs onto various electroactive surfaces. This approach was then used to construct multi-layer green emitting LEDs.
The 11-aminoundecanoic acid was converted into its ammonium bromide salt (Br−NH3+-C10-COOH) to enhance its solubility in DMF. The NPs were obtained by taking advantage of the interplay between a polar solvent (DMF, able to solubilize the perovskite precursors) and a non-polar one (toluene), as described in previously published protocols.11,13 The perovskite precursors (MABr and PbBr2) were dissolved in DMF (ratio 1:1, 0.04 M), together with oleic acid (to avoid the NP aggregation) and varying amounts of Br−NH3+-C10-COOH. A small volume of this solution was injected into toluene under vigorous stirring. The resulting solution was centrifuged in order to remove larger aggregates, and a bright luminescent supernatant suspension was obtained.
By modifying the ligand amount, a strong variation in the optical properties of the suspension was observed. In particular, when a Br−NH3+-C10-COOH/MA molar ratio of 2 was used during the synthesis, a blue light emitting NP suspension was obtained (Fig. 1a). This dispersion showed a maximum PL emission at 490 nm, an FWHM of 22 nm, and a PLQY of 25%. The influence of the long chain ammonium ligand Br−NH3+-C10-COOH on the color of the resulting suspension is a result of the equilibrium between the formation of three dimensional MAPbBr3 NPs and two dimensional structures where the ligand itself participates in the formation of layered perovskites.10,20–22 In particular, with an excess of Br−NH3+-C10-COOH, mainly 2D perovskite nanostructures are obtained. In these materials, the long chain cations alternate inorganic sheets of octahedral lead bromide, resulting in a multi-well, dielectric-semiconductor structure characterized by an increased exciton binding energy.20 The formation of such structures leads to an intense and sharp peak in the low energy part of the absorption spectra, as is clearly visible in the case of our suspensions prepared with high ligand content (Fig. 1a). On the other hand, by reducing the amount of ligand used to a Br−NH3+-C10-COOH/MABr molar ratio of 0.5, the typical MAPbBr3 absorption and emission spectra can be observed, as a footprint of 3D NP formation (Fig. 1b). This dispersion showed narrow and intense photoluminescence (centered at 521 nm, with an FWHM of about 20 nm) with an associated PLQY as high as 80%. As mentioned before, the temperature of the non-polar solvent (here toluene) was reported to be of special importance, defining the size and hence the emission wavelength of the NPs.11

Interestingly, the synthesis in the presence of Br−NH3+-C10-COOH was found to be rather temperature independent. In fact, when the synthesis is carried out at 60 °C, the absorption and luminescence spectra of the obtained NP suspension are similar to those prepared at room temperature (Fig. S1, ESI†).
We investigated the morphology of the NP suspensions prepared at 25 °C by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electron microscopy confirmed the presence of the perovskite NPs (Fig. 2a) with a diameter in the 3–10 nm range (4.5 nm in average, see Fig. S5, ESI,† for details). With increased Br−NH3+-C10-COOH content, the morphology changes showing wide 2D sheets (50–200 nm) embedded with spherical nanocrystals (Fig. 2b). This mixture of nanostructures has been described in several reports, and results from the competition among the formation of 3D and 2D-type perovskites, as described before.13,23 The choice of the cationic ligand Br−NH3+-C10-COOH was made in order to enable efficient coordination to the perovskite NPs and, thanks to the carboxyl group, allow for the anchoring of the NPs on functional surfaces, such as metal oxides.24 Moreover, the carboxyl group reduces the QD aggregation, enhancing the stability of the NP suspension, by analogy with the function of the oleic acid additive.11 Hence, we tested the adhesion of the NPs onto thin films of ZnO, an n-type semiconductor widely used as an electron injection layer in OLEDs.25 150 nm thick ZnO layers were prepared by spin-coating and high temperature annealing (400 °C) of a commercial ZnO NP suspension on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates. These ZnO coated substrates were immersed in the NP suspension for 12 hours and then rinsed with toluene before characterization. The ZnO/MAPbBr3 NP films exhibited bright photoluminescence under UV excitation (λ = 365 nm) (Fig. 3a, inset), with a maximum PL emission at 514 nm and an FWHM of 25 nm (Fig. 3a). Importantly, the associated PLQY of the thin films was as high as 52% when excited at 380 nm. Despite the decrease of the PLQY from dispersion to the solid state, this value is among the highest reported for perovskite NP thin films, most likely thanks to the anchoring of the NPs which strongly inhibits their aggregation. Time-resolved PL measurements were performed both on the colloidal solution and on the ZnO films functionalized with the NPs (Fig. S4, ESI†). In accordance with previous reports, the average lifetime for the NP suspension was found to be 65 ns, with a long tail extending towards the microsecond timescale.11,14 On the other hand, the excited state lifetime was found to be substantially reduced (11 ns) when the MAPbBr3 NPs were anchored to the ZnO surface. The same effect has been previously observed in MAPbBr3/TiO2 bilayers and was ascribed to an efficient electron injection from the perovskite to the metal oxide conduction band.26 Considering the very similar energy band alignment of TiO2 and ZnO, the same mechanism is likely to take place at the MAPbBr3 NP/ZnO interface, resulting in the shorter excited state lifetime observed here. The efficient charge transfer could also partially explain the PLQY reduction observed for the anchored MAPbBr3 NPs. Importantly, the ZnO/MAPbBr3 NP films maintained their luminescence after washing with toluene, implying that the NPs were effectively anchored to the surface. This is very important since other functional layers (i.e. organic charge transport materials) can be coated on top of the perovskite NPs, allowing for the preparation of multilayer LEDs.

(d) Comparison of the surface profiles of the same two samples. 
In order to investigate the morphology of the NPs anchored on the ZnO NP film, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used. The rather rough ZnO surface (Fig. S2, ESI†), however, made it difficult to discern the perovskite NPs. Hence, we looked for a substantially more flat surface compared to the solution processed ZnO that would allow a direct visualization of the perovskite NPs. We selected poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulphonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as a test platform to anchor the MAPbBr3 NPs. In spite of the very different chemical nature of PEDOT:PSS compared to ZnO, the perovskite NPs did also adhere on the conducting polymer coated substrate, and the films exhibited a maximum PL emission at 513 nm and a PLQY of 50%, analogous to what was observed for the ZnO/NP systems (Fig. S3, ESI†). The adhesion of the perovskite NPs on PEDOT:PSS is most likely promoted by the large amount of ionic groups (and in particular of cationic polythiopene derivatives) present in the conducting polymer, leading to a favorable electrostatic interaction between the carboxyl groups of the ligands and the surface. The morphology of the PEDOT:PSS/NP thin films was analyzed by AFM. The surface of the PEDOT:PSS film is flat and homogeneous (Fig. 3b), with an associated root-mean-square roughness of only 1.2 nm, calculated over a 2 × 2 μm area. The same surface, when coated with the perovskite NPs, is composed of densely packed particles (Fig. 3c), whose dimensionality can be estimated by measuring the surface profile (Fig. 3d). Structures with height varying from about 5 to 15 nm can be observed, indicating a low roughness and hence limited aggregation of the NPs on the surface (considering the particle size distribution obtained from TEM analysis). The lateral size of the particles, as observed from the AFM profiles, appears much larger as it is a deconvolution of the surface and the AFM tip. From this morphological analysis and considering the unchanged optical properties of the NPs when anchored to ZnO or PEDOT:PSS, we conclude that the MAPbBr3 NPs are grafted onto the semiconducting ZnO surface, where they form homogeneous and compact films, suitable for the fabrication of optoelectronic devices. Hence, multilayer LEDs with an n–i–p configuration (an n-type layer deposited on the transparent substrate) were prepared. ZnO sensitized with MAPbBr3 NPs was deposited on ITO coated glass substrates, and a 100 nm thick CBP film (4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl, acting as the hole transport layer, HTL) was spin-coated on top from its chlorobenzene solution (20 mg mL−1). The device was finished by vacuum deposition of a thin (10 nm) layer of MoO3 (facilitating hole injection from the anode to the CBP) and a 100 nm thick gold anode on top. The flat band energy diagram for the materials used in the device is depicted in Fig. 4a.

The current density and luminance versus voltage characteristics for a device using MAPbBr3 NPs as the emitting material is reported in Fig. 4b. The current density to voltage behavior shows a typical diode characteristic (low leakage, exponential forward current injection), highlighting the good quality of the device and layers used. The LED turns on at about 1.5 V applied bias, reaching a luminance of 8 cd m−2 at 8 V. Unfortunately, the current density at the same applied bias is very high (8 × 103 A m−2), limiting the overall current efficiency to about 10−3 cd A−1. This can be a consequence of the extremely thin perovskite NP layer used (virtually a monolayer), limiting the attainable electroluminescence. An uneven particle distribution causing insufficient coverage could also reduce the overall current efficiency. On the other hand, the ZnO layer used is not completely flat and can hence cause an uneven distribution of the applied field or direct electron–hole recombination at the ZnO surface. It is known that the nanocrystalline morphology of the oxide film plays an important role in determining the electroluminescence process.27 Considering that indeed LEDs employing a monolayer of luminescent NPs have been demonstrated,28 a more homogeneous and especially flat surface would be desirable when using MAPbBr3 NPs. Unfortunately, an inverted device (p–i–n) employing PEDOT:PSS/MAPbBr3 NPs in combination with an electron transport layer showed no electroluminescence at all. This is not surprising since PEDOT:PSS/MAPbBr3 is not a blocking interface, and direct charge recombination at the conducting polymer is favored.
In summary, a temperature-independent synthesis of MAPbBr3 nanoparticles (NPs) employing the ammonium salt of 11-aminoundecanoic acid (Br−NH3+-C10-COOH) as a ligand has been developed. Dispersions of NPs with a diameter below 10 nm and a PLQY of about 80% can be readily obtained at room-temperature and under atmospheric conditions. Thanks to the use of the Br−NH3+-C10-COOH bifunctional ligand, the NPs can be anchored on a variety of electroactive surfaces, such as inorganic semiconductors or conducting polymers. The NPs anchored to ZnO and PEDOT:PSS thin films showed a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield of approximately 50%. The NP-sensitized ZnO films can be directly integrated into light-emitting devices, leading to modest but homogeneous light-emission. The anchoring of perovskite NPs on several flat and semiconducting surfaces is being investigated, with the potential of opening new paths for the preparation of simple and inexpensive multilayer light-emitting devices.
