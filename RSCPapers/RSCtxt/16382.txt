    , Accepted 30th November 2016First published on 2nd December 2016AbstractThe synthesis of two symmetrical molecules with A–D–A (1) and D–A–D (2) structures is reported. The compounds have Zn-porphyrin as the donor component and 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DT-DPP) as the acceptor unit, linked through ethynyl π-bridges. The effect of scaffold modification on the electrochemical, optical and photovoltaic characteristics has been investigated and favourable properties are found for the D–A–D system compared to the A–D–A. These two Zn-porphyrin-based small molecules are used as donors along with PC71BM as the acceptor for the fabrication of solution processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells in order to obtain information about the effect of donor and acceptor positions on the photovoltaic response of the devices. A strategy for optimizing the morphology of the active layer using a binary solvent additive has been used. After the optimization of the weight ratios between 1 or 2 and PC71BM and the solvent additives, the devices based on 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM active layers show remarkable PCE values of 7.04% and 8.03%, respectively. The higher PCE obtained for 2:PC71BM compared to 1:PC71BM can be related to the increase in Jsc and FF and attributed to lower energy loss, strong π–π intermolecular stacking and more balanced charge transport.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer (consisting of a blend of electron donor and electron acceptor type organic semiconductors) have generated great interest globally due to their potential for the low cost fabrication of large area devices by solution processing techniques.1 Conjugated polymers2 and small molecules3 have been extensively developed as donors for BHJ structured OSCs. The appropriate selection of push–pull conjugated polymer donors, optimization of the nanoscale morphologies of active layers and interface engineering have led to increases in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from less than 2% before 2008 to over 12.2% today,4 which is approaching the performance required for commercialization. In comparison to conjugated polymers, small molecules have well-defined structures and good batch to batch reproducibility and are easy to purify and low cost. Moreover, the absorption properties, energy levels, solubility and hole mobilities of small molecules can be easily tailored by synthesis to meet the criteria required for good donor materials for BHJ OSCs.5 Indeed, the power conversion efficiencies of BHJ-SMOSCs have exceeded 10% (ref. 6) and are comparable to those of OSCs based on conjugated polymers.
The efficiency of OSCs depends on the light harvesting ability and energy levels of their organic active materials. Porphyrins are aromatic compounds that display unique optical, electronic and redox properties due to their eighteen delocalized π-electrons. Their optical and electrochemical properties can be tailored by enhanced conjugation. Extension of the porphyrin π-system by designing of extended porphyrins, conjugated porphyrin oligomers or conjugated porphyrin-aromatic systems is an interesting tool to control electronic coupling, to fine tune the HOMO–LUMO gap, to change the absorption and emission features and to modulate the redox characteristics. Moreover, the near infrared (NIR) absorption and emission features of π-extended porphyrins make them particularly suitable for optoelectronics and energy conversion applications.7 The π-conjugated macrocyclic core of porphyrins exhibits an intense absorption in the Soret band at 400–450 nm (molar extinction coefficient of 105 M−1 cm−1) and moderate Q-bands in the 500–650 nm wavelength region. As a consequence of these outstanding properties, molecules based on porphyrins have been successfully used as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) and PCE values higher than 13% have been achieved.8 Finally, due to the thickness limitation imposed to obtain good carrier extraction, molecules with outstanding light absorption are a prerequisite; thus, it is clear that porphyrins are an appealing target for OSCs and the application of porphyrin derivatives as donors in solution-processed BHJ organic solar cells has attracted significant interest in recent years, with PCE values up to 9.06%.9 An excellent review of this field has been published.9p
To achieve high PCE values an ideal bandgap of 1.2–1.6 eV is necessary and conjugated donor (D)–acceptor (A) systems are often used to reduce the bandgap. Although many A−D−A molecules have been applied in BHJ solar cells,10 the search for D–A–D chromophores is not widespread and only a few examples have been reported to date.11,12 As a consequence, there is a lack of comparative studies that explore how the alteration of the molecular backbone influences the properties of the molecules and the efficiency of devices. Thus, in the work described here we synthesized two new symmetrical D−A−D and A−D−A molecules, 1 and 2 (Scheme 1), based on Zn-porphyrin as the donor and 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DT-DPP) as the acceptor unit bound through an ethynyl π-linker. The molecule 1 has a similar chemical structure to that reported by Peng et al. except for the side chain.9e The optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of these materials were investigated. The nature of the solubilising units was kept constant in order to minimize related changes in the material properties. Our comparative study on these two compounds revealed a significant increase in the PCE value of solution processed BHJ D−A−D (2):PC71BM devices. After the optimization of the weight ratio and the solvent additive, a PCE value as high as 8.03% was achieved and this is higher than that of A–D–A (1):PC71BM (PCE = 7.04%). The increased PCE of 2:PC71BM is probably a consequence of the better balanced charge transport, lower energy loss and more favourable nanoscale morphology of the active layer.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The A−D−A chromophore 1 with a central Zn-porphyrin donor component and two 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-diones (DT-DPP) as terminal acceptor units was synthesized in 39% yield (Scheme 1a) by double Sonogashira coupling between Zn-porphyrin 4,13 prepared by deprotection of 3, and DT-DPP derivative 5.14
The D−A−D dye 2, which has a central DT-DPP core as an acceptor and two terminal Zn-porphyrin macrocycles as donors, was prepared (45% yield) according to Scheme 1b by following a similar procedure in which Zn-porphyrin 7 and dibromo-DT-DPP 8 (ref. 15) were coupled.
Compounds 1 and 2 were purified by Gel Permeation Chromatography (eluent: toluene) and silica filtration followed by precipitation (methanol and pentane/dichloromethane, respectively). The two new compounds were fully characterized by FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (for characterization see the ESI†). Thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S15†) showed that both compounds exhibit good stability, i.e., 303 °C (1) and 397 °C (2).
Optical properties
The absorption properties of chromophores 1 and 2 were investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy. The absorption spectra in dilute dichloromethane solution (c = 10−6 M) are displayed in Fig. S16† and the noteworthy optical properties are summarized in Table 1. The A−D−A compound 1 exhibited the characteristic absorption bands of both blocks, the porphyrin core (λmax = 466 nm) and DT-DPP (λmax = 568 nm),16 and these were bathochromically shifted with respect to precursors 3 and 5 (Fig. S16a†). More importantly, a new broad and intense band (logε = 4.4) with a maximum at 736 nm was observed for 1 and this is assigned to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT); the ICT character of this absorption band was confirmed by measuring the absorption spectra in solvents with different polarities (Fig. S17a†), with a bathochromic shift observed in benzonitrile (λmax = 750 nm). The D−A−D compound 2, which contains two Zn-porphyrin macrocycles, shows a similar spectrum but with a more intense absorption band assigned to the two porphyrin macrocycles (λmax = 442 nm, logε = 5.4), as one would expect (Fig. S16b†). The ICT band was then observed with a maximum at 710 nm. Once again, a bathochromic shift was observed when the spectrum was recorded in benzonitrile as the solvent (λmax = 750 nm) (Fig. S17b†). The higher shift observed in 2 (+40 nm) than in 1 (+14 nm) for the ICT band, in the more polar solvent (benzonitrile) when compared to dichloromethane, suggests a higher push–pull effect in 2. Finally, it can be concluded that the broader absorption and higher molecular absorption coefficients in D−A−D compound 2 compared to those of A−D−A compound 1 indicate that 2 exhibits stronger co-axial π–π stacking than 1. Moreover, in solution the absorption spectrum of A–D–A (1) shows an interesting feature, with significant merging of the two bands in comparison to the D–A–D (2) analogue. The redshift of around 24 nm for the Soret band can be explained by an extension of the conjugation of the electron donating segment in the A–D–A molecule when compared to the D–A–D system. The spectra in films of compounds 1 and 2 (Fig. 1) show an absorption peak at 794 nm (1) and 818 nm (2), and these are red-shifted by 58 nm and 108 nm, respectively, compared to the absorption spectra in solution.

 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra in CH2Cl2 solution (10−6 M) (—) and thin film cast from CH2Cl2 (—) of 1 (a) and 2 (b). 
This result can be interpreted as an effect of J-aggregated domains with ordered molecular stacking in the film. The tight intermolecular stacking of J-aggregates is beneficial for the hole transportation properties and photovoltaic performance of devices.17 Moreover, a vibronic shoulder peak observed at around 740 nm and 755 nm for 1 and 2, respectively, also indicates strong molecular ordering in the solid state. Finally, the optical bandgaps (Eoptg) were calculated from the onset wavelength (λonset) of the absorption spectra in thin films using Eoptg = 1240/λonset (eV), with values of 1.41 and 1.38 eV obtained for 1 and 2, respectively.
Electrochemical properties and energy levels
Cyclic (CV) and Osteryoung square wave (OSWV) voltammetry measurements (Fig. S18 and S19†) were performed using the Fc/Fc+ redox couple as the standard to determine the oxidation and reduction potentials of compounds 1 and 2 (Table 1). Similar reversible first oxidation (+0.34 V for both compounds) and reduction (1: −1.41 V, 2: −1.38 V) potentials were found for both compounds. The data were converted into frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels vs. vacuum and identical HOMO values (−5.44 eV) were found as both compounds showed a similar electron donor strength (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  FMO energy levels and band gap (solid area) of molecules 1 and 2 and their relative positions with respect to the LUMO of PC71BM. 
A slightly lower LUMO was found for 2 (−3.72 eV) when compared to 1 (−3.69 eV) and this contributes to a reduction of the bandgap (1: 1.75 eV and 2: 1.72 eV) consistent with the optical band gap observed in solution absorption spectra. Therefore, a change in the chemical structure from A–D–A to D–A–D did not have any influence on the frontier molecular energy levels of the molecules. The deeper HOMO energy level in both compounds would be beneficial to achieve a high and similar Voc for BHJ OSCs in both cases (see below). The offset of the LUMO relative to PC71BM in both compounds is an appropriate driving force for charge separation. Finally, the lower band gap and higher absorptivity in 2 should be responsible for higher current in the devices. However, the higher bandgap estimated from the OSWV measurement can be attributed to the energy needed for electron transfer during the oxidation and reduction process, which is commonly observed in most organic semiconductors.18
Theoretical calculations
Quantum chemical DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level were performed to gain additional insights into the geometry and electronic properties of the two molecules. Compounds 1 and 2 both have an almost planar structure for an all conjugated system with dihedral angles of less than 2°; interestingly, the dihedral angles between the thiophene rings and the porphyrin macrocycle are as low as φ ≈ 2° (Fig. S21†). These planar geometries favor π–π stacking and good hole mobility. The electron densities of the HOMOs of small molecules 1 and 2 are distributed throughout the whole structure (Fig. S20†). In contrast, the electron densities of the LUMOs are predominantly located on the DPP units. Interestingly, D–A–D compound 2 has a higher theoretical dipolar moment (1.42 D) in comparison to the A–D–A analogue 1 (1.10 D) (see Fig. S21†).
Photovoltaic properties
The solution processed BHJ OSCs were fabricated with 1 or 2 as the donor and PC71BM as the electron acceptor using a conventional device structure indium-tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/1 or 2:PC71BM/poly[(9,9-bis (3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN)/Al. In our earlier report on OSCs based on porphyrin as a donor and PC71BM as an acceptor, we found that the optimized donor to acceptor weight ratio was 1:2.13 Therefore, we first fabricated the device with a 1:2 D/A weight ratio (un-optimized) using chlorobenzene (CB) as the solvent without any additive. The results are summarized in Table 2 and the corresponding J–V characteristics and IPCE spectra are displayed in Fig. S22 (see ESI†). The devices based on 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM active layers showed overall PCE values of 2.73% (Jsc = 7.38 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.84 V and FF = 0.44) and 3.39% (Jsc = 8.22 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.86 V and FF = 0.48). The higher PCE value of the device with 2, relative to 1, is mainly attributed to the larger Jsc value and was also confirmed by the IPCE spectra (Fig. S22†), since the IPCE values are higher for the entire wavelength region for the device based on 2 except around 600 nm when compared to 1. Another benefit of the D–A–D porphyrin 2 is the low energy loss. The energy loss (Eloss) is a measure of internal photon conversion in the BHJ blends and is defined as Eloss = Eg − qVoc, where Eg is the optical bandgap of the donor material.19 The Eloss for the BHJ OSC with 2 (0.52 eV) is lower than that for the BHJ OSC with 1 (0.57 eV) and this is beneficial for the high Jsc and PCE values. Peng and co-workers reported a DPP-porphyrin small molecule with a very low energy band gap of 1.37 eV and an open circuit voltage of 0.78 V obtained in BHJ OSCs, which corresponds to a low energy loss of 0.59.9k

Our devices showed a higher Voc value with a low energy loss due to the deeper HOMO energy levels of compounds 1 and 2. Moreover, we measured the hole mobilities of active layers based on 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM, processed under different conditions, from the fitting of the J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices in the dark with a space charge limited current (SCLC) (Fig. 3) and found that the hole mobility of 2 (5.64 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) is higher than that for 1 (4.13 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) – a difference that may be responsible for the higher FF values for 2 relative to 1.
 Fig. 3  Current–voltage characteristics of hole-only devices based on active layers cast from CB and binary solvent/CB solvents. The solid lines are the results of SCLC fitting. 
In an effort to improve the PCE of the devices using either 1 or 2 as the donor, we added 0.4 v% of pyridine in the host CB solution and then spin coated the active layer. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. 4a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The Jsc and FF values of the devices increased significantly and the Voc was slightly lower, which led to PCE values of 4.77% and 5.62% for 1 and 2, respectively. The increase in Jsc and FF may be attributed to the increase in both the interfacial area and effective transport channels. When the active layer was processed with the binary solvent additives [1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) + pyridine]/CB, the PCE was enhanced up to 7.04% and 8.03% for the devices based on 1 and 2 (Fig. 4a and Table 2), respectively, with a significant improvement in both Jsc and FF. It should be noted that both of the small molecules showed the same trends in photovoltaic parameters under different conditions. D–A–D small molecule 2 will be used as a model molecule to discuss the origin of the enhancement in the PCE after mixed solvent treatment.
 Fig. 4  (a) Current–voltage characteristics under illumination and (b) IPCE spectra of OSCs based on 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM active layers processed with pyridine/CB and pyridine + DIO/CB solutions. 
The significant improvement in Jsc and FF for binary solvent additives indicates that pyridine plays an important role in optimizing the nanoscale morphology. The enhancement in Jsc may originate from a change in the molecular assembly of the Zn-porphyrin due to the solvent additive.9o When pyridine is used as the solvent additive, it forms a 1:1 complex with the Zn-porphyrin, and pyridine in solution interacts with PC71BM and promotes the mixing of 2 with PC71BM. These interactions with pyridine prevent self-aggregation of the porphyrin and PC71BM during the drying of the active layer, despite the lower boiling point of pyridine (115 °C) when compared with chlorobenzene (131 °C). The binary solvent additive, i.e., a mixture of pyridine and DIO added to the host chlorobenzene, induces mixing of the porphyrin molecule with PC71BM. Since the boiling point of DIO (332 °C) is higher than that of either pyridine or CB, the DIO can cause PC71BM to assemble and the porphyrin to crystallize, thus producing bi-continuous interpenetrating pathways in the BHJ active layer.20
In order to obtain information about the origin of the enhancement of Jsc and FF after the incorporation of solvent additives, we investigated the IPCE response, charge transport and morphology of the blended film with and without solvent additives. The IPCE spectrum of the devices is shown in Fig. 4b. It can be seen that all of the devices exhibit broad IPCE spectra covering the wavelength range from 350 nm to 850 nm and this closely resembles the absorption spectra of the corresponding active layers. For the device with a solvent additive, either pyridine or DIO + pyridine, the IPCE was across the entire wavelength region and was higher than that for devices without additives, which indicates that the photon to electron conversion efficiency is high. We also measured the hole mobility of the optimized active layer (pyridine + DIO/CB) as a cast film using the SCLC method (Fig. 3) and found that the hole mobility increased to 1.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for active layers based on 1 and 2, respectively, whereas the electron mobility increased slightly from 2.36 × 10−4 to 2.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, indicating that the charge transport is more balanced in the OSCs based on the active layer processed with the binary solvent additive. This phenomenon is related to the increase in the crystallinity and nanoscale morphology of the active layers.
The devices based on 2 showed higher PCE values than those based on 1 and this is attributed to the higher Jsc and FF values, whereas Voc remained almost the same. Compound 1 is an A–D–A-type small molecule whereas 2 is a D–A–D system. The optical and electrochemical properties are almost the same but the molar extinction coefficient of 2 is higher than that of 1, which is responsible for the higher Jsc for 2 relative to 1. In the case of the A–D–A structure 1, the direction of the dipole moment diverges from the central donor core to the peripheral groups along the conjugated branches, whereas for D–A–D structure 2 the direction of the dipole moment converges from the peripheral groups to the central acceptor core along the conjugated backbone. The convergence of the dipole moments from the peripheral groups to the central core along the conjugated backbone, based on 2, may increase coplanar π–π stacking, which is beneficial to charge transport across the thin film-based OSCs9o and leads to higher FF and Jsc values for the OSCs. Moreover, the relatively large red-shift and increase in the thin film absorption at this long wavelength peak for 2 compared to 1 indicate a more ordered solid state packing of the aromatic molecules and thus the better electronic communication between the intermolecular stacks improves the properties21 and leads to an increase in Jsc.
We measured the dielectric constants of 1 and 2 at 1 kHz using a device configuration ITO/1 or 2/Al employing an impedance analyser, and found values of 3.61 and 4.73 for 1 and 2, respectively. The difference may be due to the different direction of the dipole moment due to different chemical structures in terms of A–D–A (1) and D–A–D (2) and a larger dipole moment for 2 relative to 1 (as confirmed by the theoretical calculations). This is due to the stronger intramolecular dipole for D–A–D (2) than A–D–A (1), which lowers their coulombic interaction and therefore requires a lower driving force for exciton dissociation and charge transfer. The dipolar properties of organic materials play an important role in the process of charge separation when blended with PC71BM.22 The BHJ active layer based on 2 (D–A–D), with a large dipole moment, results in a slower recombination rate (will be discussed in the variation of Jph with Veff), which indicates that electrons and holes are less tightly bound.23 Moreover, the large polarizability of the excited state, which results from the higher dipole moment of 2, lowers the exciton binding energy, thus enhancing the electron transfer rate across the 2:PC71BM BHJ active layer and ultimately leading to enhanced solar cell performance.24
As shown in Fig. 3b, the IPCE values of the OSCs based on 2:PC71BM active layers are higher over the entire wavelength range and the IPCE spectral response is broader when compared to that of OSCs based on 1:PC71BM active layers. The Jsc values calculated from the integration of IPCE spectra are 13.32 mA cm−2 and 14.13 mA cm−2 for OSCs based on optimised active layers with 1 and 2, respectively, and these are in good agreement with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V characteristics of the devices under illumination.
As discussed above, the hole mobility of the 2:PC71BM active layer under all processing conditions is higher than that of 1:PC71BM and the electron mobility is almost the same, a finding that also indicates a more balanced charge transport in the devices based on 2:PC71BM when compared to 1:PC71BM-based devices. This leads to an increase in the FF and Jsc values, which in turn leads to higher PCE. As a solar cell consists of a donor and acceptor blended active layer, both electrons and holes contribute to photocurrent generation. Therefore, the effective mobility μeff = 2μhμe/(μh + μe) is used to express the charge carrier mobility.25 The μe and μh are the hole and electron mobilities respectively. The higher value of μeff for the active layer based on 2 (2.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) when compared to that based on 1 (1.44 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) may be one of the causes of the higher PCE.
In order to obtain information about the difference in the photogeneration of the charge carriers in the devices based on A–D–A (1) and D–A–D (2) porphyrins, we investigated the variation of photocurrent (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 5). After the absorption of light, the excitons generated in the active layers are dissociated into free charge carriers and these drift to the corresponding electrode due to the internal effective voltage between the anode and cathode in the solar cell. The Jph value is estimated as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is determined as Veff = Vo − V, where Vo corresponds to build-in voltage, which refers to the voltage at which Jph is zero and V is the applied voltage.25 As shown in Fig. 5, in the low voltage region, Jph increases linearly with Veff. In the high voltage region, however, Jph approaches saturation, where a larger Veff is capable of sweeping out all of the carriers to the electrodes.25 It should be noted that in the case of devices based on D–A–D (2), Jph is saturated at a lower Veff when compared to devices based on A–D–A (1), indicating that even a low Veff is more effective in sweeping out the photogenerated charge carriers after exciton dissociation and is more efficient. The photocurrent can be fitted by the expression Jph = qLGmaxPc, where q is the electronic charge, L is the thickness of the active layer in the device, Gmax is the maximum generation rate for electron–hole pairs, and Pc is the charge collection probability. Pc can be expressed as Q/Qo = (μτ/LL′)Veff[1 − exp(–LL′/μτVeff],26 as described by the Hecht model, where μ is the charge carrier mobility, τ is the carrier lifetime, and L′ is the collection length (the average collection length can be assumed to be L/2 in the donor–acceptor blended film). Q/Qo is the fraction of free charge carriers that are collected by the electrode at time t for a given Veff and is equal to the photocurrent as a fraction of the reverse saturation current (Jph/Jphsat) and denoted as Pc. The holes and electrons are transported in the donor and acceptor phases towards the anode and cathode, respectively, so the parameter μτ/LL′ determines the shape voltage dependence of Jph and is a property of the active layer film in the device. Jsc is the short circuit photocurrent and this is 7.38 mA cm−2, 8.22 mA cm−2, 13.41 mA cm−2 and 14.19 mA cm−2 for 1:PC71BM (CB cast), 2:PC71BM (CB cast), 1:PC71BM (pyridine + DIO/CB cast) and 2:PC71BM (pyridine + DIO/CB cast) devices, respectively, and Jphsat is 9.46 mA cm−2, 10.06 mA cm−2, 15.24 mA cm−2 and 15.60 mA cm−2 for 1:PC71BM (CB cast), 2:PC71BM (CB cast), 1:PC71BM (pyridine + DIO/CB cast) and 2:PC71BM (pyridine + DIO/CB cast), respectively. The values of Pc under short circuit conditions are around 0.78, 0.82, 0.88 and 0.91 for 1:PC71BM (CB cast), 2:PC71BM (CB cast), 1:PC71BM (pyridine + DIO/CB cast) and 2:PC71BM (pyridine + DIO/CB cast) devices, respectively. The value of Gmax can be estimated from the expression Jphsat = qLGmax,27 and the estimated values are around 3.1 × 1021, 3.58 × 1021, 5.25 × 1021 and 6.28 × 1021 cm−3 s−1 for 1:PC71BM (CB cast), 2:PC71BM (CB cast) 1:PC71BM (pyridine + DIO/CB cast) and 2:PC71BM (pyridine + DIO/CB cast), respectively. The increased values of Gmax and Pc are also consistent with the higher values observed for devices based on 2.

In order to obtain information about the morphology of the optimized active layer (binary/CB) with small molecules 1 and 2 blended with PC71BM, transmission electron microscopy measurements were performed. The TEM images are shown in Fig. 6. The black and white domains correspond to the PC71BM-rich (due to high electron density)27 and porphyrin-rich regions, respectively. Both of the active layers showed fine phase separation between the porphyrin and PC71BM domains. The 2:PC71BM blend film showed slightly larger domains compared to 1:PC71BM, which is more favourable for charge transport and leads to higher PCE for the devices based on 2:PC71BM. This characteristic is also supported by the hole mobility measurements.

Conclusion
Two new symmetrical D−A−D and A−D−A molecules, 1 and 2, have been synthesised. The molecules are based on Zn-porphyrin as the donor and 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DT-DPP) as the acceptor unit connected through ethynyl π-linkers. The optical and electrochemical properties have been investigated. The optical and electrochemical properties suggest that these two materials are suitable for the donor component in conjunction with PC71BM as the acceptor for efficient solution processed BHJ SMOSCs. The electrochemical properties of these systems show a similar HOMO value for both compounds, which suggests an analogous value for the Voc of the devices. Nevertheless, a lower HOMO–LUMO gap was found for D–A–D molecule 2 (1.72 eV) along with a higher molar extinction coefficient with respect to 1 (1.75 eV); the higher absorption and the bathochromic shift of the absorption in 2 enhance the harvesting of solar photons.
In order to improve the PCE of our device, a solvent additive method was used for film deposition, the solution processed OSCs based on 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM showed overall PCE values of 7.04% and 8.03%, respectively. The higher PCE of the devices based on 2 when compared to 1 may be due to the different position of the porphyrin (donor) and DT-DPP (acceptor) in the molecular backbone. This difference leads to different absorption spectra in thin films, although the frontier molecular orbital energy levels remain the same, and this in turn leads to different photocurrent and FF values while Voc remains almost unchanged. The high Jsc values of the devices based on 1 may also be related to the lower energy loss compared to 2 and the higher hole mobility, which results in more balanced charge transport. The 2:PC71BM thin film exhibits a more suitable nanoscale morphology for exciton dissociation and charge transport and the resulting device shows higher Jsc and FF values and a correspondingly high overall PCE of 8.03%. These results show that changing the positions of the donor and acceptor in the D–A porphyrin small molecule can play an important role in tailoring the electrical properties of the small molecule and also influence the morphology of the active layer when blended with the PC71BM acceptor. This change also enhances the performance of BHJ organic solar cells.
