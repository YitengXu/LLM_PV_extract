    , Accepted 22nd April 2019First published on 23rd April 2019AbstractCurrent–voltage hysteresis is a critical issue that impacts the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells, and thus, it is imperative to develop high-efficiency perovskite solar cells without hysteresis behavior. Herein, we report the fabrication of efficient planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells employing solution-processed NiCo2O4 as the hole transport layer. The spinel NiCo2O4 thin film obtained via a sol–gel process exhibits high optical transparency, well-matched energy bands, smooth film morphology and decent electrical conductivity, much better than NiO, a typical hole transport layer for perovskite solar cells. We herein demonstrated that due to excellent hole extraction, transport, and collection properties of the solution-processed NiCo2O4, the device efficiency of up to 18.16% was achieved for the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. More importantly, the devices with NiCo2O4 as the HTL exhibited hysteresis-free behavior regardless of the voltage scan rate, which out-performed NiO-based devices.
1. Introduction
Solar cells based on organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites as the light absorbing materials have attracted extensive interest due to their extraordinary characteristics such as broadband light absorption with a low band gap, high light absorption coefficient, long charge carrier lifetime and admirable charge transport properties.1–5 Using the most advanced perovskite solar cells (PSCs), certified PCEs exceeding 23% have been achieved in a single-junction device through extensive efforts in material engineering and device optimization.6–8 Compared to typical mesoscopic device structures, planar heterojunction devices with p-i-n structures have received significant attention due to their simple device structure and easy manufacturing process. The use of various materials for the interfacial layer can tune not only the photovoltaic performance but also the stability of the devices;9–12 in addition, this is a suitable structure to achieve flexible and transparent devices because of the low-temperature solution processing and high light transparency of the thin interfacial layers. Thus, the p-i-n structure is promising for the fabrication of practical solar cells.13–15 More significantly, p-i-n devices have been reported to have negligible hysteresis with the varying scan rate and direction as compared to the n-i-p device;16 thus, a stable power output can be expected from the p-i-n PSC devices.16
To achieve high photovoltaic performance of p-i-n PSCs, the selection of the hole transport material is important because the movement, such as transport and collection, of charges is mainly dominated by the interface between the perovskite layer and electrode; moreover, it is important to quickly transport the hole because the hole travels slower than the electron.17–19 A hole transport layer (HTL) for planar PSCs must meet several requirements, such as a pinhole-free surface, high transparency, and well-matched energy levels to both the electrode and the perovskite layer, to deliver maximum photovoltaic performance.20–22 In this regard, a variety of semiconductors have been used as HTLs in planar PSCs, and promising PCEs have been achieved.23–26 Among them, solution-processed p-type metal oxides possess several advantages over other semiconductors in terms of electronic conductivity, chemical stability, robustness, and optical transparency in the UV-Vis range, which would provide improved hole extraction and transport properties. Nickel oxide (NiO) is an interesting type of metal oxide that has been successfully applied in optoelectronic devices;27 in recent years, NiO has been extensively investigated as a robust HTL for planar PSCs, and promising PCEs exceeding 17% have been demonstrated due to the deep valence band (VB) edge, wide band gap, and hydrophilic surface of NiO.28,29 However, most of the p-type metal oxides have low electrical conductivity and unstable surface defects, which result in inefficient hole extraction and thus accelerated charge recombination. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop a p-type inorganic semiconductor with excellent optoelectronic properties for use in the HTL of planar PSCs.
In recent years, nickel cobalt oxide (NiCo2O4) has been reported as a feasible p-type semiconductor for a variety of optoelectronics such as anodic oxygen evolution catalyst, supercapacitors, infrared transparent conducting electrodes, dye-sensitized solar cells, and sensors.30–35 NiCo2O4 with a cubic spinel structure, in which all the Ni2+ ions occupy the octahedral sites and the Co3+ ions are distributed between the tetrahedral and octahedral sites, delivers a superior electrical conductivity (∼500 S cm−1) as compared to NiO and cobalt (II or III) oxide. NiCo2O4 possesses a wide optical band gap (∼2.4 eV) and a deep VB of ∼5.3 eV, which meets the optoelectronic requirements well as an HTL in p-i-n PSCs. Moreover, the core elements of NiCo2O4 are abundant and environmentally friendly; this suggests that NiCo2O4 can be an appropriate replacement of metal-oxide HTLs to achieve efficient p-i-n PSCs. Very recently, Choulis and co-workers have reported the use of NiCo2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) prepared via combustion synthesis in the HTL of PSCs, and the PCEs of up to 15.5% have been achieved.36 Choy and co-workers have also synthesized ultra-small NPs of NiCo2O4 using a deamination reaction of Co–NH3 in the presence of Ni(OH)2.37 The uniform HTL obtained from NiCo2O4 NPs resulted in the PCEs of up to 18.23% with high stability. According to these studies, the preparation of solution-processed NiCo2O4 HTLs via the facile sol–gel protocol is still of interest to achieve n-i-p PSCs with high efficiency.
Herein, we report the solution-processed p-i-n PSCs with high photovoltaic performance obtained using sol–gel-processed NiCo2O4 as an excellent HTL. The sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 film generates a uniform HTL with high optical transparency and decent electrical conductivity, which are comparable or even better than those of NiO. The optimized sol–gel-processed NiCo2O4 HTL exhibited promising PCEs of up to 18.16%; a systematic evaluation of the hysteresis revealed almost negligible mismatch between the J–V scans of NiCo2O4–based devices. Encouragingly, NiCo2O4 generated better photovoltaic performance and comparable ambient stability under continuous illumination as compared to NiO. All these results validate the significant potentials of the sol–gel-processed NiCo2O4 HTL for achieving high-photovoltaic performance p-i-n PSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Herein, 61.1 mg of Ni(OCOCH3)2·4H2O (0.49 mmol) and 122.3 mg of Co(OCOCH3)2·4H2O were mixed in 2-methoxyethanol (9.5 mL) containing a small amount of monoethanolamine (15 μL). After the solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours, a uniform precursor solution was formed. Then, 1 mL of the solution was transferred into the other vial to dilute by adding 1.67 mL of 2-methoxyethanol followed by filtration with a PTFE-D filter having a pore size of 0.2 μm. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared as reported elsewhere.37 PbI2 (461 mg), CH3NH3I (159 mg) and DMSO and (78 mg) (molar ratio 1:1:1) were mixed at room temperature in 600 mg of a DMF solution under vigorous stirring for 1 hour, followed by filtration using a PTFE-D filter with the pore size of 2 μm.
2.2. Fabrication of thin-film perovskite solar cells
The ITO-coated glass substrates (20 Ω sq−1) were cleaned sequentially with water, acetone, and isopropanol under sonication for 30 min and treated with UV-O3. The NiCo2O4 layer was formed by spin-coating NiCo2O4 on an ITO-coated glass (2000 rpm, 60 s), and the substrate was then annealed at 340 °C for 1 hour in ambient air. After cooling the substrate to room temperature, the precursor solution was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 25 seconds to form a perovskite layer. After 7 seconds, 400 μL of chlorobenzene was poured onto the substrate during spin coating. After thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min, PC61BM (15 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) and bis-C60 surfactant (2 mg mL−1 in isopropyl alcohol) were sequentially deposited by spin-coating at 1500 rpm for 60 s and 3000 rpm for 60 s, respectively.38 Finally, 100 nm of Ag was evaporated under high vacuum (<5 × 10−6 Torr). The device area was defined as 10 mm2 by the shadow mask.
2.3. Characterizations
The elemental investigation was carried out via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (K Alpha, Thermo Science) using a MgKα/AlKα dual anode X-ray source. Absorption and transmittance measurements were carried out using a spectrometer (Cary 100, Agilent). The fluorescence lifetime was measured by a time-correlated single photon counting system using the picosecond laser with an excitation at 405 nm. Surface morphologies of thin films were observed using an atomic force microscope (CoreAFM, Nanosurf) in the tapping mode and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (S-4800, Hitach). The work function of the NiCo2O4 thin films was measured by a Kelvin Probe (SKP5050, KP Technology) using a Au film as a reference. The electrical conductivity was calculated by eqn (1) where ρ is resistivity, t equals thickness, and k is a geometric factor, which for a semi-infinite thin film is π/(ln2). (1)
The J–V curves of the devices were obtained using a parameter analyzer (4200-SCS, Keithley) under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G), which was calibrated using an NREL-certified photodiode. The EQE of the device was measured using a lock-in amplifier system that records the short-circuit current density under chopped monochromatic light. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the devices was investigated using a potentiostat (Compactstat, IVIUM). The intensity-modulated photocurrent and photovoltage were measured by a potentiostat with a light-emitting diode (LED) (IVIUM, IM1225).
3. Results and discussion
The sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 thin films were prepared using a precursor solution of nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate and cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (at the molar ratio of 1 to 2) in 2-methoxyethanol. As is well-known, the morphology of sol–gel-processed metal oxide thin films varies with the annealing temperature.38 The influence of annealing temperature on the surface morphology of the sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 thin film was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 1). The as-spun NiCo2O4 thin film shows a flat surface without any discernable grain boundaries because no sol–gel conversion occurred, and the surface cracks originated due to shrinkage of the film as the solvent evaporated. After the thin film was annealed at 340 °C, the film exhibited a fully covered compact surface with well-crystallized and densely packed grains having the grain size of ∼10 nm. The single-crystalline cubic structure of spinel NiCo2O4 was confirmed by the X-ray diffractogram (Fig. S1, ESI†).39 As the annealing temperature increases to 400 and 500 °C, the grains grow larger, and thus, the grain boundaries become quite apparent. In addition, the NiCo2O4 thin films annealed at high temperatures possess some big particles that can act as defect sites for charge recombination. The surface morphology of the NiCo2O4 thin film was further studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 2, the NiCo2O4 thin films exhibited very smooth and compact film surfaces with the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3.1 nm, which was comparable or even smoother than that of the sol–gel-processed nickel oxide (NiO) thin film. The flat and uniform film surface is favorable as a robust underlayer for the consecutive solution processing of the perovskite thin film in p-i-n PSCs. Note that the grain size for NiCo2O4 (∼120 nm) is slightly larger than that for NiO (∼60 nm), as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The electrical conductivities of the NiCo2O4 and NiO thin films were compared using conductive AFM (c-AFM) (Fig. 2c and d). A significantly higher current flow is clearly observed for the NiCo2O4 thin film, which corresponds to much higher electrical conductivity, as evident by the sheet resistance measurement (Table S1, ESI†). Since excellent conductivity is a prerequisite for the interfacial layer to achieve high-efficiency PSCs, NiCo2O4 is a promising candidate for the HTL of efficient p-i-n PSCs.

Details of the elemental composition and the oxidation state of the sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 were obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. Fig. 3 shows the XPS spectrum for Ni2p and Co2p in the sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 thin films annealed at different temperatures. The XPS spectra of Ni2p exhibit spin–orbit doublets of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, and the peaks are indexed to Ni2+ and Ni3+ at 854.3/871.9 eV and 852.5/870.0 eV, respectively. The broad peaks at 861 and 878 eV denote the shake-up satellite peaks.36,40 The XPS spectra of Co2p also contain spin–orbit peaks for 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, and they are indexed to Co2+ and Co3+ at 779.6/795.0 eV and 778.2/793.3 eV, respectively.37 For the film annealed at 340 °C, the atomic ratio of Ni:Co is 1.12:2, obtained via the integration of peak area for 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 with sensitivity factors. At higher annealing temperatures, the ratio of Ni:Co increased to 1.16:2 and 1.26:2 for the films annealed at 400 and 500 °C, respectively; this indicated that higher annealing temperature induced the formation of a nonstoichiometric spinel structure. The ratio of Ni3+/Ni2+ is 0.28, 0.26, and 0.18 for the NiCo2O4 thin films annealed at 340, 400, and 500 °C, respectively. Because the Ni3+ state induces an oxygen deficiency in NiCo2O4, the higher density of Ni3+ in the film annealed at 340 °C would contribute to the increase in hole conductivity.

The optical properties of the sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 thin film and the perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) layer formed on the NiCo2O4 layer were investigated. The transmittance of the NiCo2O4 thin film exceeds 95% at wavelengths greater than 350 nm due to low optical absorbance of this film in the UV-Vis-NIR region (Fig. 4a). The calculated optical band gap of NiCo2O4 was found to be 4.71 eV from the Tauc plot of the absorbance, indicating the presence of a direct band gap (Fig. S3a, ESI†). Note that the optical properties of NiCo2O4 thin films do not depend on the annealing temperature, as shown in Fig. S3b (ESI†). In addition, the transmittance of the NiCo2O4 thin films is comparable to that of NiO; this confirms the excellent transparency of the sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 thin films (Fig. S3d and e, ESI†). Because photons penetrate into the perovskite layer through the HTLs in p-i-n PSCs, high optical transparency of a broad range of HTLs is a prerequisite to promote the light absorbing property of the perovskite layer. Then, the formation of a perovskite layer was carried out using an anti-solvent washing protocol, and a fully covered dark, shiny, and mirror-like perovskite layer was obtained on NiCo2O4 (Inset of Fig. 4b). The perovskite thin film showed a distinct absorption shoulder and edge at 755 and 780 nm, respectively, suggesting that a well-crystallized perovskite layer was formed on NiCo2O4. Fig. 4c displays the X-ray diffraction pattern of a perovskite layer on sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4. Typical scatterings at the 2θ values of 14.0, 28.2 and 31.9° were observed for the CH3NH3PbI3 film and assigned to the (110), (220) and (310) crystal planes, respectively, in accordance with the literature.41 The weak diffraction characteristic peak at the 2θ value of 12.6° has been assigned to PbI2 residues, which are commonly observed in perovskite films. The perovskite thin film surface on NiCo2O4 consists of uniform and compact grains with the grain size of 300–500 nm, which is comparable to the film morphologies of CH3NH3PbI3 formed on metal oxide-based HTLs.

To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the devices with sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 as the HTL, the devices were fabricated with the p-i-n device architecture of glass/ITO/NiCo2O4/perovskite/PC61BM/Bis-C60/Ag, where PC61BM and Bis-C60 were used as an electron transporting layer and a cathode modifier, respectively.42 The chemical structure for PC61BM and Bis-C60 are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The photovoltaic performance characteristics were evaluated by determining the photocurrent density versus voltage (J–V) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE). Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves of the best-performing PSCs with NiCo2O4 annealed at different temperatures, and the corresponding device parameters are listed in Table 1. The devices employing the sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 thin films exhibited PCEs that decreased as the annealing temperature increased from 340 to 500 °C. The PSCs with NiCo2O4 (340 °C) delivered the PCEs of up to 18.02%, with the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.06 V, the JSC of 22.28 mA cm−2, and the FF of 0.76. It is obvious that higher annealing temperature deteriorates the short-circuit current density (JSC), and thus, the devices exhibit the inferior PCEs of 12.96% and 11.91% with NiCo2O4 annealed at 400 and 500 °C, respectively, as the HTL. Because the optical properties and work-function of NiCo2O4 are not strongly influenced by the annealing temperature, the PCE decrease may be mainly attributed to the unoptimized electronic properties of NiCo2O4. As investigated by XPS analysis, higher annealing temperatures lead to not only decreased ratio of Ni3+ to Ni2+ but also non-stoichiometric composition of Ni and Co in the spinel structure. The unoptimized electronic structure deteriorates the conductivity of NiCo2O4 from 4.89 × 10−1 to 2.88 × 10−1 S cm−1, and thus, the poor hole transport and collection capability of the HTL would lead to inferior photovoltaic performance (Table S1, ESI†). The JSC values measured under illumination were well consistent with the integrated values obtained from the EQE curves; this verified the superior photoelectric conversion property of sol–gel driven NiCo2O4 at 340 °C (Fig. 5b). The influence of varied thicknesses of NiCo2O4 on the device performance was also investigated. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the NiCo2O4 thin film obtained using 0.75 wt% of the precursor solution, which corresponds to a thickness of ∼40 nm, yields best PCE, whereas thicker or thinner films generate rather poor results (Table S2, ESI†); thus, the precise control of NiCo2O4 thickness is necessary because thicker HTLs may increase the series resistance or have rough surfaces, whereas very thin HTLs would lead to a short circuit during the operation of devices.

The charge transport/extraction efficiencies of the sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 films were assessed by monitoring the photoluminescence (PL) of the perovskite layer with regard to individual HTLs. Fig. 5c shows that the PL of the perovskite film is quenched significantly in the presence of the NiCo2O4 thin films in the order of the annealing temperature of 340 °C > 400 °C > 500 °C. An effective PL quenching suggests more selective extraction of the hole carriers from the perovskite layer. Thus, the NiCo2O4 film annealed at 340 °C has afforded the most efficient charge transfer from perovskite to the HTL that is critical for preventing electron–hole pair recombination and increasing the PCE of the solar cells. We further investigated the transient PL quenching using a time-correlated single photon counting system (Fig. 5d). The PL decay curves have been fitted using a biexponential decay function, which suggests that the PL decay of the perovskite takes place through two relaxation pathways: a fast and a slow decay process. The fast decay is considered to correlate with effective hole extraction by the HTL, whereas the slow decay is suggested to represent radiative decay within the perovskite layer.43 The bare perovskite layer on a glass substrate showed the average lifetime (τave) of 158 ns for the photogenerated excitons, whereas the perovskite layer on the NiCo2O4 films annealed at 340, 400, and 500 °C exhibited the τave of 79, 108, and 136 ns, respectively. The fast decay of PL is evidence of effective hole extraction at the interface between the perovskite and HTL, which is well consistent with the steady-state PL results. Thus, it is concluded that the sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 annealed at 340 °C results in the most appropriate HTL for efficient charge transfer and transport to the corresponding electrodes with regard to the perovskite layer.
Hysteresis with a change in the scan direction during the J–V measurements is a critical issue for PSCs with a planar heterojunction.44 In particular, p-i-n PSCs employing metal oxide-based HTLs usually suffer from severe hysteresis due to the unstable interface, low electrical conductivity and deep trap sites that accelerate charge recombination at the interface between the perovskite and the HTLs.45,46 To study the hysteresis behaviors, J–V measurements in different scan directions were conducted for the devices obtained using sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 annealed at 340 °C, as shown in Fig. 6. The corresponding device parameters for the hysteresis investigation are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). To quantify the hysteresis of the devices, a hysteresis effect index (HI) is defined as (2)and the PCEs obtained via the J–V measurements in different scan directions are exactly the same. For the fast scan at the scan rate of 500 mV s−1, the calculated HI was only 0.011, and thus, the device exhibited the PCE difference of only 0.03% (Table S1, ESI†). The hysteresis was still negligible with small HI values (less than 0.05) for the J–V measurements conducted at the slower scan rates of up to 25 mV s−1. As the scan rate further decreases to 10 mV s−1, the device shows slight hysteresis behavior with the HI of ∼0.1; however, this HI is comparable or even better than those of metal oxide-based HTLs such as NiO.47 Because charge accumulation and charge traps at the interfaces of the devices are the major reasons for the hysteresis, the small HIs for the slow J–V measurements reflect that the sol–gel driven NiCo2O4 thin film is good at efficient hole extraction from the perovskite layer.

These benefits of NiCo2O4 allow us to suggest the potential application of the sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 thin film in the fabrication of p-i-n PSCs with enhanced PCEs. Since the state-of-the-art p-type metal oxide to achieve efficient PSCs is NiO, we have simultaneously fabricated devices using NiO and NiCo2O4 as HTLs to compare their photovoltaic performances. The NiO layer was prepared by a sol–gel process as described in the Experimental section, and the well-defined layers in the device were revealed by the cross-sectional analysis, where  denotes the area under the reverse scans of J–V measurements and  denotes the area measured under forward scans.48 Based on the eqn (1), an HI close to 1 indicates a serious hysteresis, whereas an HI value close to 0 represents a suppressed hysteresis of the measurements. As shown in Fig. 7a, cross-sectional SEM images of NiO and NiCo2O4 based PSCs show very thin HTLs, identically. We compared the J–V characteristics of PSCs using NiCo2O4 and NiO as HTLs, as shown in Fig. 7b. Note that all the devices were simultaneously prepared using the same precursor solutions for the layers except for each HTL. The p-i-n PSCs obtained using NiO show the champion PCE of 14.55% with the VOC of 1.04 V, the JSC of 20.20 mA cm−2, and the FF of 0.69, which are comparable values to those reported in the literature and much inferior to those of the NiCo2O4-based devices with the champion PCE of 18.16% (the VOC of 1.06 V, the JSC of 22.35 mA cm−2, and the FF of 0.76) under 100 mW cm−2 illumination.49–52 The enhancement in VOC, JSC, and fill factor (FF) with NiCo2O4 occur primarily due to the better optoelectronic properties such as higher electrical conductivity, high optical transparency, and the well-matched work function of NiCo2O4 (Fig. S5, ESI†) to the VB of the CH3NH3PbI3 film. The integrated JSCs obtained via the EQE measurements also exhibit higher photon-to-electron conversion efficiency in the entire wavelength from 350 to 750 nm, verifying the benefit of NiCo2O4 for the generation of photocurrent in p-i-n PSCs (Fig. 7c). The statistical histogram obviously indicates that a substantial improvement in the PCEs was achieved by replacing the HTL with NiCo2O4 for all the devices fabricated under the same conditions (Fig. 7d).

To further understand the PCE discrepancy between NiCo2O4 and NiO, intensity modulated spectroscopy of the devices with different HTLs was investigated. The modulated measurements provide valuable information on charge transfer and recombination kinetics at the interfaces of the devices. The electron transport time constant (τc) and the electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) can be derived from eqn (3): τc = 1/2πfc and Dn = ω2/(2.35τc),(3)where ω and fc are the thickness of the perovskite films (∼450 nm in this study) and the characteristic frequency minimum obtained from intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) curves, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8a, the plots of τc for the devices with varied short circuit currents (ISC) indicate that the electron transport becomes significantly faster at the interface between the perovskite layer and NiCo2O4 as compared to that in the case of NiO, and thus, the electron diffusion coefficient for the PSCs with NiCo2O4 is significantly longer than that in the case of NiO. As a result, a reduced backward recombination is expected in the devices employing NiCo2O4, which will contribute to enhanced photovoltaic performance.53 For the intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) analysis, the recombination time constant (τr) was calculated using the equation τr = 1/2πfr, where fr is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMVS curves with different ISCs (Fig. 8b). The NiO-based device exhibited shorter τr, and thus, the absolute time for bimolecular recombination was very short; on the other hand, NiCo2O4 prolonged the τr for recombination in the device. These results obviously show that NiCo2O4 effectively improves the interface between the HTL and perovskite layers, leading to quick hole extraction and suppressed charge recombination at the interface of perovskite/NiCo2O4 in the devices.54
 Fig. 8  Device analyses for IMPS (a), IMVS (b), EIS (c), and PCE degradation for p-i-n PSCs employing sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 and NiO thin films (d). 
We then conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to examine the advantage of NiCo2O4 for improved charge transport in the devices. Fig. 8c shows the Nyquist plots for the devices with different HTLs measured in the dark with a 0.75 V bias in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 10 mHz, and the fitting results of the equivalent circuit are listed in Table 2 (The Nyquist plot for the devices under irradiation and the fitting result are also shown in Fig. S6 and Table S4, ESI†). The high frequency intercept to the Z′ axis, which represents the series resistance (Rs), is mainly associated with the serial resistance of the ITO, HTL and the perovskite layer. Specifically, the semicircle in the high-frequency range is correlated with interfacial resistance (Rtrans) occurring at the interface between the perovskite layer and the HTL, whereas the semicircle in the low-frequency range corresponds to the recombination resistance (Rrec) at the interface of the perovskite/HTL. For the device with NiCo2O4, Rtrans was substantially decreased; this indicated quick transport of hole carriers from the perovskite to HTL, and thus, charge recombination at the interface between perovskite and NiCo2O4 could be suppressed. On the other hand, the NiCo2O4-based device exhibits higher Rrec than NiO; this also suggests reduced recombination rate for the device employing NiCo2O4 because the recombination rate is inversely proportional to Rrec.55 Based on the EIS results, it can be demonstrated that charge transfer and recombination in p-i-n PSCs are significantly improved by replacing the conventional NiO with NiCo2O4; this is well consistent with the IMPS and IMVS analyses. Consequently, the sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 thin film is a promising HTL for efficient charge transport and reduced charge recombination, which is responsible for the enhanced photovoltaic performance of p-i-n PSCs.56

Durability upon ambient storage remains another big challenge for the PSCs and hinders their use in practical applications. To investigate the device stability of the PSCs employing the sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 HTL, bare devices without any encapsulation or desiccant were stored under ambient conditions with continuous illumination. Note that 5 sets of devices were stored under ambient conditions at the relative humidity of 55 ± 10% and the average temperature of 25 °C, and the J–V curves under illumination (100 mW cm−2) were obtained until the PCEs remained less than 50% of their initial values. As shown in Fig. 8d, the devices using NiO and NiCo2O4 as the HTL exhibited a similar PCE variation upon storage, maintaining 47% and 44% of their initial efficiencies after 96 h, respectively. The variation in other device parameters, such as VOC, JSC, and FF, is shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). In another set of stability tests, the NiCo2O4-based devices still exhibited an inferior stability as compared to NiO-based devices (Fig. S9, ESI†). However, via further optimization of crystallinity, film thickness or electronic structure, the stability of the NiCo2O4-based devices could be improved as much as that of NiO-based devices. Therefore, sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 is a promising candidate for the replacement of NiO to achieve high-performance p-i-n PSCs.
4. Conclusions
We herein demonstrated a simple but effective strategy for the preparation of a promising HTL to achieve high-performance p-i-n PSCs; the sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 thin films exhibited high electrical conductivity, high optical transparency, a well-matched work function and effective hole extraction from the perovskite layer. Based on the abovementioned advantages, the sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 thin film delivered the champion PCE of 18.16% as an HTL in p-i-n PSCs. Encouragingly, the sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 thin film generated a marginal hysteresis at very slow scan rates. In addition, the NiCo2O4-based devices exhibited significantly improved PCEs as compared to the NiO-based devices. All the results analyzed in this study clearly suggest the advantages of using the sol–gel-driven NiCo2O4 thin film as a promising HTL to achieve highly efficient and stable p-i-n PSCs for practical use.
