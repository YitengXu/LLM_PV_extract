    AbstractThe combined use of a tetranuclear Ru(II) dendrimeric photosensitizer (1) and of a tretraruthenium substituted polyoxotungstate (2) as the catalyst enables photo-induced water oxidation at 550 nm producing O2 with an outstanding quantum yield of 0.30.
Water oxidation poses a formidable challenge being the energy-demanding bottleneck of artificial photosynthesis.1 According to a modular photosynthetic approach, oxidation of H2O to O2 is the key source of electrons and protons powering the reductive half-reaction, where hydrogen is produced. H2 is the most sought alternative to carbon fuels. As the global need for benign and renewable energy sources becomes urgent, photoinduced water oxidation is at the center of an ever-growing research effort.2
A promising system enabling photoinduced water oxidation has recently been optimized by Mallouk and coworkers.3 The working asset is based on the combined use of hydrated IrO2 nanoparticles as catalyst, and of Ru(II) polypyridine complexes for light activation. Following this principle, photo-assisted water splitting has been achieved in a dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cell under visible light irradiation.4 Innovation in this matter focuses on two main issues: (i) access to a larger fraction of visible energy, by means of photosensitizers with absorption properties at λ > 520 nm; (ii) minimization of charge recombination and/or decomposition of the oxidized photosensitizer by promoting its fast hole scavenging by the catalytic domain. In this latter respect, nanostructured IrO2 are relatively slow (ms timescale),3,4 thus poisoning the overall performance of the photo-induced catalysis.
Building on our expertise, a powerful up-grade of the photocatalytic system can be envisaged, to address both requirements outlined above (Scheme 1). In the first instance, we have previously identified a first-generation dendrimer, tetranuclear Ru(II) photosensitizer, [Ru{(μ-dpp)Ru(bpy)2}3](PF6)8, 1 (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine; dpp = 2,3-bis(2′-pyridyl)pyrazine), with enhanced visible absorption properties. Compound 1 belongs to the class of (supra)molecular light-harvesting antennas featuring significant absorption throughout a large portion of the visible region (see Fig. S1† for comparison between absorption spectrum of 1 and solar irradiation at the sea level).5 Compound 1 enables photocatalytic water oxidation by IrO2 in the presence of persulfate as sacrificial acceptor, under light irradiation with λ up to 700 nm and quantum yield (Φ = O2 moles/moles of absorbed photons) ≥0.015.6 Noteworthy, 1 works at a wavelength where classical [Ru(bpy)3]2+-type compounds are totally ineffective.6 A second aspect of the problem relates to the nature of the oxygen evolving catalytic core and its interaction and electron transfer rate with the photogenerated oxidant.
 Scheme 1  Photocatalytic water oxidation powered by the interplay of tetra-ruthenium sensitizer/catalytic sites of 1 and 2. Photoinduced electron flow and scavenging by persulfate as sacrificial acceptor is represented by arrows (see eqn (1)–(4)). Structures are shown omitting charges and counterions, ruthenium centers are magenta colored. 
We turned our attention to the totally inorganic oxygen evolving complex [Ru4(μ-O)4(μ-OH)2(H2O)4(γ-SiW10O36)2]10−2 (Scheme 1), exhibiting a multi-turnover efficiency and fast kinetics 8,9 Compound 2 is a highly robust polyanion, in which the tetra-Ru(IV) μ-oxo core mimics the oxygen-evolving complex of natural photosynthesis by undergoing four consecutive oxidation steps, before releasing oxygen.10 The performance of 2 as a water oxidation catalyst has been demonstrated in dark conditions,8,9 and by using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as sensitizer in the presence of sacrificial acceptors.11 Evidence about a very fast hole scavenging process of photogenerated [Ru(bpy)3]3+ by 2 has been recently obtained with time-resolved spectroscopy, yielding a diffusion-controlled electron transfer rate (ns timescale).12 This result is instrumental for overcoming the slowness of hole scavenging processes associated with the use of IrO2 nanoparticles.
Herein we report on the key choice of combining photosensitizer 1 with catalyst 2, thus mastering the light-capture and H2O activation events by the interplay of unique tetra-ruthenium sensitizer/catalytic sites (Scheme 1). By using persulfate as sacrificial acceptor and operating in phosphate buffer solution, oxygen evolution occurs with an unprecedented photon-to-oxygen quantum yield, Φ = 0.30, at an excitation wavelength of 550 nm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the top-record Φ value obtained for photoinduced water oxidation by a molecular assembled system.
In a typical experiment, 2 mL of a buffered (KH2PO4, 1 × 10−2 M, pH = 7.2) deoxygenated water solution containing 1 (1 × 10−4 M), 2 (as lithium salt, 6 × 10−5 M), Na2S2O8 (1 × 10−2 M), and Na2SO4 (5 × 10−2 M) were irradiated (λ > 550 nm) into a sealed cell. Photoinduced oxygen evolution was monitored in a second compartment, following the O2-dependent emission lifetime of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ in deoxygenated acetonitrile (2.5 ml) by a time-correlated single-photon-counting spectrometer, after quantitative calibration of the time-resolved spectral response.
The generally accepted scheme of the photo-driven oxygen evolving process is given in eqn (1)–(5). PS + hv → *PS(1) *PS + S2O82−→ PS+ + SO42− + SO4−(2) PS + SO4− → PS+ + SO42−(3) PS+ + OEC → PS + OEC+(4) OEC4+ + 2H2O → OEC + O2 + 4H+(5)In these eqs, PS is the photosensitizer (1 in the present case) and OEC is the oxygen evolving catalyst (2 in this case). The sequence of eqn (1)–(3) has to be repeated twice and eqn (4) has to occur four times (involving different oxidation states of OEC, finally yielding OEC4+) before eqn (5) takes place. According to such a scheme, two photons are required for the production of one O2 molecule (note that the SO4− species might also react directly with OEC, not only with PS; however this should not lead to significant changes on the overall process).

Fig. 1 shows the time-profile of oxygen evolution during continuous irradiation of the 1/2/ S2O82− system: linear kinetics is maintained up to ca. 80% reaction within the overall experimental time (180 min). In this time-frame, a O2 evolution accounts for a persulfate conversion >90% (average yield over three runs). Similar results are obtained by using different buffers and pH conditions (Na2SiF6, 2.6 × 10−3 M/Na2B407, 1.14 × 10−2 M; pH = 5.8).
 Fig. 1  Photocatalytic oxygen evolution as a function of time (λirr > 550 nm) observed in water (KH2PO4, 1 × 10−2 M, pH = 7.2) in the presence of 1 (1 × 10−4 M), Na2S2O8 (1 × 10−2 M) and 2 (as lithium salt, 6 × 10−5 M, circles), or IrO2 nanoparticles (6 × 10−5 M in iridium oxide content, triangles). Malonate-stabilized IrO2 nanoparticles were used because they are more efficient than the formerly studied citrate-stabilized ones.3,6 For the malonate-stabilized IrO2 nanoparticles, photoinduced quantum yield for oxygen evolution turns out to be ≥0.055 (measured within the first 5 min of catalytic activity). 
A direct comparison with catalysis by the malonate-stabilized IrO2 nanoparticles is reported in Fig. 1. It can be noted that colloidal IrO2 displays a significantly lower efficiency in terms of both rate and O2 yield, moreover the oxygen evolving activity levels off at ca. 15% conversion after ca. 80 min. This has been attributed to the degradation of the photosensitizer, occurring by competing pathways after excitation.3,4
Catalyst 2 turns out to scavenge the ruthenium-centered PS+ (eqn (4)), with a rate constant in the ns timescale when PS = [Ru(bpy)3]2+.12 Based on thermodynamics, and assuming that all the processes involved occur in the Marcus normal region of classical electron transfer theory, the sequential hole scavenging of PS+ by 2, ultimately yielding 24+, is expected to be faster for PS = 1 (whose oxidation potential falls at +1.55 V vs. SCE7) than for PS = [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (oxidation potential, +1.26 V7).‡ Whereas this hypothesis needs to be directly verified by ultrafast spectroscopy,§ very fast hole scavenging processes of PS+ would have the dual function of increasing the efficiency of the overall process and protecting the photosensitizer from photoinduced decomposition. In fact, comparison between the absorption spectra of the solution before and after the process (Fig. 2) indicates that only minimal changes takes place, suggesting a sensitizer decomposition ≤5%.
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of the buffered water solution containing 1, 2, and the persulfate/sulfate sacrificial agent (see text) before (solid line) and after 180 min of light irradiation (dashed line). The spectral range shown is referred to the lowest-energy MLCT bands of the photosensitizer. Decomposition of the photosensitizer is estimated from the reduction of its absorption at 550 nm. 
Performance parameters including turnover frequencies, generally used to evaluate catalytic systems, have a limited value for photoinduced processes, as these latter strongly depend on both the irradiation intensity and the photosensitizer absorption; a more relevant parameter is the photoreaction quantum yield (Φ). On exciting at a single wavelength (550 nm) and using Aberchrome 540 in toluene as quantum yield standard13 at 293 K (incident photon flux, 1.08 x 1015 photons s−1), the quantum yield of oxygen production results Φ = 0.30 (± 0.03). This is significantly larger than the literature Φ = 0.045 reported for [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as photosensitizer with 2 as catalyst, and obtained by irradiation in the range 450–520 nm,11¶ Although the complete mechanistic picture is yet to be clarified, the increase in light conversion efficiency by almost one order of magnitude is likely ascribed to an enhanced robustness and stability of the photochemical system. In this matter, the predicted faster hole scavenging involving 1+ and the various oxidation states of 2 along the multistep route to prepare 24+ can play a key role.
The photoreaction quantum yield warrants additional comments: first of all, the maximum Φ possible is 0.5, according to eqn (1)–(5).|| Losses in efficiency can involve the reactions in eqn (2)–(4), whose optimization by a careful tuning of the reagent/ionic strength/pH conditions will be an issue of future exploitation. On the basis of the experimentally determined Φ, ca. 60% of the absorbed photons are herein used to produce oxygen. This result together with the possibility of accessing a large fraction of solar energy, including photons in the red region of the solar spectrum up to 700 nm,6 is remarkable and paths the way towards the utmost goal of a sustainable hydrogen economy from light-activated water splitting.**
The solution speciation of the photocatalytic components, and their interaction, likely enhanced by the complementary charge features, are currently under investigation.
