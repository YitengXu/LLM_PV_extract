1. Introduction
Ice is widespread on the surface of materials,1–3 especially in the north and south cold zones on Earth. In these regions, due to the extreme weather, the surface of materials become icy. For example, due to the formation of ice on high-voltage wires, they increase in weight,4,5 resulting in their breakage. Also, ice causes a decrease in the ground friction on aircraft runways, roads, and railway tracks,6,7 causing travel inconvenience and posing a severe danger to the safety of humans. It is clear that the problems caused by the ice phenomenon deeply affect every aspect of life.8–10 In 2020, frost hit cities in northern China, causing road closures, rail disruption and flight delays in parts of Liaoning and Jilin. The economic losses resulting from this indirectly amounted to 500 million Yuan. In 2021, a severe blizzard hit Texas, leaving more than 2 million people without power, affecting more than 2000 miles, and directly or indirectly causing problems for 150 million Americans. Consequently, there is widespread recognition that efforts to address the phenomenon of ice will have enormous economic and social benefits.
In the past decades, several ice-proof approaches have been implemented to decrease the formation of ice and enhance ice-phobic effectiveness. Traditional means to prevent ice accumulation mostly include mechanical, thermal, and other chemical de-icing methods.11 However, these approaches are not only inefficient, but also energy-intensive or pollute the environment. Accordingly, because of the drawbacks of the above-mentioned methods, material surfaces based on superhydrophobic structures have gradually become the research focus in the field of ice protection. As is known, water is an indispensable substance for the existence of life, and ice is another state of water, which suggests that surfaces that can be removed from water also have some ice resistance.12 At present, there are many ways to prepare excellent superhydrophobic surfaces, where droplets disengage from the surface before solidifying or the contact area between the liquid and the solid is minimized. These exceptional methods include electrochemical, laser, and spray treatment. The developed low surface energy substances include polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS), tetrafluoroethylene, perfluoroalkyl polyether, and fluoroalkylsilane. However, the development of ice-resistant materials still faces many problems, such as unreasonable designs, controlling the preparation of large-size surfaces, and the fact that the large-scale application of low surface energy substances can harm the environment.
Fortunately, nature has created and selected many near-perfect structures and surface substances to solve these problems. The initial inspiration came from the phenomenon of water droplets not accumulating on the surface of the lotus leaf. However, the binding between ice and the lotus leaf surface has a higher adhesion than water. This is because after freezing, the contact angle of the droplets decreases, increasing the contact area between them.13 In addition, freezing of the cell contents disrupts the division of plant cells and the metabolic activity of the cell membrane. Therefore, in the case of cold-resistant organisms that grow in high humidity and low temperatures, their surfaces are most likely to evolve, activating ice-proof functions. Thus, in the future, ice-proof surfaces inspired by cold-resistant organisms will attract increasing attention from researchers. In the current literature, according to the three stages of surface ice, ice protection can be divided into three aspects, as follows: (1) extend the ice time of the surface and reduce its heat transfer efficiency;14 (2) decrease the accumulation of surface ice and design reasonable textured structures;15,16 and (3) reduce the adhesion between ice and the substrate.17,18
In recent years, the number of publications on superhydrophobic ice-proofing has exponentially increased.19 The problem of ice accumulation on surfaces has received wide attention. Thus far, some excellent articles and reviews about anti-icing surfaces have been published.20–24 However, with the rapid development of this field, the summary of ice-proof materials in recent years seems incomplete. Especially, ice-proof materials inspired by cold-resistant creatures are relatively rare.25,26 In this review, we aim to discuss the latest developments on bioinspired superhydrophobic ice-proof surfaces and present our views. Section 2 focuses on biological cold-resistant ice-proof materials. Section 3 distinguishes the standard approaches for the preparation of superhydrophobic ice-proof surfaces. Section 4 introduces the theory of icing formation and summarizes the current ice-proof strategies. Section 5 analyzes how to improve the durability of ice-proof surfaces to strengthen their practical application. In the final section, the current difficulties encountered and the future prospects are briefly addressed.
2. Biological ice-proof materials
Biology is an essential source of design structures and innovative materials for humans.27,28 Creatures in nature often show excellent performances when fighting harsh environments.29 In recent years, due to the rapid development of interdisciplinary studies, scientists have put more focus on mimicking the structures of biological surfaces. In this section, we summarize the research progress of ice-proof materials inspired by biology, such as clover, polar bear hair, kingfishers, kale, taro leaves and skunk cabbage. Herein, we list some common cold-resistant creatures. The anti-icing principle of these creatures is deeply analyzed, and the anti-icing performance of biomimetic materials is compared (Table 1). As is known, the cold-resistant characteristics of organisms are related to their genes, where the purpose of preventing freezing is achieved by suppressing their own free water content. However, observing the surface structure, it has been found that they have different micro–nano designs, including grooves, pits and papillae. Consequently, these other structures also increase the survival rate of organisms at low temperatures.

2.1 Clover
Clover has attracted attention because of its unique cold-resistant properties. At low temperatures, its surface still maintains a hydrophobic effect. A raw image of a clover is shown in Fig. 1a. It can be seen that the water droplets dripping on its mature leaves present a totally spherical shape. Gou et al.30 observed that the water contact angle and sliding angle of clover in different periods were different. It was observed that when the young clover grows and matures, a semi-elliptical light green stripe appears on its surface. This is caused by the uneven distribution of pigments, resulting in an uneven leaf color. It can be seen that the contact angle of the mature clover is 147.3°, which is more hydrophobic than that of the young leaves and withered leaves. As is known, surface roughness plays a crucial role in the wettability of plant leaves. It can reduce the contact area between water and solid surfaces in the air. As shown in Fig. 1b, the epidermal cells of the adult clover are superimposed with a thicker epidermal wax. In addition, the distribution of nanorods on the cover of the mature stage is also denser. Inspired by the clover bionic concept, Liu et al.31 obtained a superhydrophobic surface with anti-icing properties through high-speed wire electrical discharge machining (HS-WEDM) technology and a low-surface energy deposition method. The experimental results showed that the artificial bionic superhydrophobic contact angle is 153.2° with an anti-icing performance, and its freezing delay rate reached 60.9% (Fig. 1(c)).

2.2 Polar bear hair
Polar bears have hollow hairs and excellent cold resistance under extremely low-temperature conditions.32 The open structure of polar bear hairs and the uniquely arranged surface of their outer shell are shown in the images in Fig. 2(a), indicating that they have excellent thermal insulation properties and hydrophobic capabilities. Shao et al.33 reported a superhydrophobic porous material that simulates the air layer retention capacity of polar bear fur (Fig. 2(b)). The fibers used to weave this fabric were made via the freeze-spinning method, which provided a regular porous microstructure. After the superhydrophobic surface treatment, the obtained fabric with a porous microstructure and superhydrophobic surface could trap air in its multi-scale porous structure, exhibiting a water contact angle of 150°.

2.3 Kingfisher
Flying in the rain is a significant challenge for kingfishers and thus they have evolved with advanced superhydrophobic capabilities due to the super-hydrophobicity and elasticity of their feather surface (Fig. 3(a)). Through experiments and theoretical analysis, Zhang et al.34 confirmed that an elastic superhydrophobic surface can improve the hydrophobicity of a substrate. The rigid superhydrophobic surface was prepared by depositing a bottom surface energy substance on superhydrophobic copper mesh, which was compared with a natural kingfisher feather (elastic superhydrophobic cover). Compared with the typical rigid superhydrophobic substrate, the rebound of the droplets on the flexible substrate had apparent behavior. By dividing the droplets into as many parts as possible on the superhydrophobic surface, the mass of the droplets was redistributed, thereby achieving the hydrophobic effect.

2.4 Kale
As is known, the surface of almost all plants that grow in winter needs to have super-hydrophobicity (Fig. 4(a)),35 otherwise the cold air will freeze the residual water on the surface into a thin layer of ice, frostbiting the surface tissue of the plant. As a superhydrophobic winter plant, the kale studied by Alizadeh-birjandi36 and others has potential application value in resisting the severe cold weather in winter (Fig. 4(b)). To highlight the ice-proof advantages of kale, the authors chose lettuce for comparative experiments. Based on the evaluation and comparison of the contact angle between the two, the delay time of freezing completion and the activation energy of freezing nucleation, it was concluded that only a high contact angle and a small contact area could effectively prevent the accumulation of surface ice.

2.5 Taro leaves
Taro leaves are similar to lotus leaves in that they are both superhydrophobic. However, they are different due to the fact that taro leaves also have a unique microstructure.37–39 The surface microstructure of taro leaves is shown in Fig. 5(a). Using scanning electron microscopy with different magnifications, it was clearly seen that many elliptical protrusions with an average diameter of about 10 mm are uniformly distributed in the corresponding nest cavity, creating a microstructure on the taro leaf.40 Liu et al.41 used direct laser interference lithography (DLIL) and hydrothermal treatment to make the surface of bionic taro leaves (Fig. 5(b)). The micro-pillar array structure was fabricated via the DLIL method, and a layer of nanogram systems was fabricated after hydrothermal treatment. The experimental results showed that the layered composite possessed an apparent contact angle (CA) of 172°, sliding angle (SA) of 4°, and strong ice resistance and delay time of 3723 s.

V, Copyright 2020. 
2.6 Skunk cabbage
The previous examples focused on building ice-proof surfaces with superhydrophobic substrates. Alternatively, Ramachandran et al.42 studied the surface micro–nano structure and wetting properties of skunk cabbage (Fig. 6(a–c)), where its leaves can generate heat. Thus, this plant is famous for melting snow. The leaves of skunk cabbage are hydrophobic but not superhydrophobic and have a high contact angle hysteresis (Fig. 6(d)). Studies have found that due to the presence of hydrophobic defects, the water droplets are in a Cassie-Baxter damp state and may have high adhesion. The heat generated by the plant should be able to maintain a thin layer of melted water and air pockets between the leaf surface and the surrounding ice. This ensures low adhesion between the ice and the blade surface, and ice can easily slide off under its own weight. This process can be considered similar to the injection of a slippery liquid inspired by the pitcher plant into a porous surface. Moreover, the Cassie-Baxter immersion wet state helps reduce heat loss compared to the Wenzel wet state. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the surface adhesion of ice by controlling the wetting state of the surface.

3. Preparation of superhydrophobic ice-proof surface
According to the Cassie–Wenzel state theory, the rough structure and chemical composition of a surface are two key factors that affect its wettability.
Regarding the structure of surface roughness, nature presents a few options, such as grooves, pits, and papillae (section 2). These bionic prototypes act as good guidance for our imitation. In the case of the chemical composition of surfaces, fluorine-containing and silicon-containing compounds are currently the main ones. In recent years, methods for the preparation of superhydrophobic surfaces have attracted widespread attention, which can be classified into two groups, namely bottom-up and top-down methods.43 The former method includes coating, deposition, and self-assembly. These methods are considered to be microscopically processed directly on the surface. The latter methods include laser ablation, etching, and hydrothermal treatment. These methods enable the construction of the desired microstructure. After preparing the microstructure, there are usually two methods for hydrophobization. One is to add nanoparticles to a low surface polymer, whereas the other is to use chemical modification to add low surface energy to the surface microstructure material. This chapter details the methods developed for the preparation of superhydrophobic surfaces in recent years. Also, they are grouped according to the different surface micro-topography and anti-icing strategies for simple classification (Table 2).

3.1 Electrochemical methods
Electrochemical etching and electrochemical deposition are two common methods for treating the surface of materials.44,45 Both refer to the redox reactions that occur through the migration of positive and negative ions in an electrolyte solution and gain and loss of electrons at the electrode under the action of an external electric field, resulting in the formation of a thin film or microscopic grooved surface. Rahimi et al.46 prepared a micro–nanocone superhydrophobic nickel film using electrochemical deposition technology on a nickel-plated plate, and after 10 days of air treatment, the surface showed a contact angle of 156°.
Zhao et al.47 prepared a superhydrophobic surface by depositing a self-assembled fluorinated silane monolayer on a copper substrate using the electrochemical deposition technique plus chemical vapor deposition and prepared copper surfaces with different rough structures by varying the magnitude of the energizing current. Specifically, the magnitude of the current density determined the deposition rate, and it was experimentally demonstrated that choosing a small current density would deposit a dense nanocone structure on the surface, while maintaining a larger contact angle of 160° and a sliding angle of less than 5° (Fig. 7(a)).

Tam et al.48 used electrochemical deposition technology to add hydrophobic cerium oxide ceramic particles to an acid electrolyte and used copper as a substrate to electrodeposit the nickel-cerium oxide particles (Fig. 7(b)). Microscopic observations found that the surface sub-particles were oxidized by an average grain size of less than 100 nm. In the composition of the cerium nanocrystals, as the volume fraction of cerium oxide added increased, the contact angle increased linearly after vacuum treatment. When the volume content increased to 97%, the coating appeared to be superhydrophobic, with an average contact angle of 156° and sliding angle of 25°. Experiments verified that the deposited copper substrate has higher hardness and wear resistance, where compared with the traditional polycrystalline substrate, the composite coating reinforced the nickel-based metal substrate.
Using plasma electrolytic oxidation technology to treat a surface is an effective method to obtain a rough structure. Plasma electrolytic oxidation technology can be employed to grow a corrosion-resistant and wear-resistant oxide ceramic film on the surface of materials (AI, Mg, Ti, etc.). The bonding force between the metal substrates is strong and the film thickness range is wide and controllable. Yang et al.49 used plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) technology to prepare superhydrophobic inorganic alumina coatings (Fig. 7(c)). In the absence of low surface energy organic modification, OH ions regularly corroded the alumina film by controlling the electrochemical process. After the passivation film was broken down, an aluminum oxide film was formed, and the OH ions corroded the bottom oxide film along the hole. The contact angle reached 150 ± 3° and the sliding angle was reduced to 8 ± 2°.
3.2 Laser ablation
Laser ablation technology is a feasible method for processing the surface microstructure of materials.50 It can efficiently construct metal surface microstructures and provide orderly, regular, and distance-adjustable surface traces. Hauschwitz et al.51 used nanosecond laser ablation to control the distance of the laser track to generate squares of varying sizes, and then put them in a vacuum machine for four hours. Consequently, the surface changed from super-hydrophilic to superhydrophobic. The vacuum process accelerates the chemical adsorption of organic molecules on the laser surface, reducing the required time to a few hours, and there is no fluorine-containing substance on the surface. Experiments have proven that when the square diameter is between 50–60 μm, the surface has good superhydrophobicity, the contact angle is more than 170°, and the sliding angle is less than 5°.
Huang et al.52 used laser etching technology (Fig. 8(a)) to change the etching parameters to form two different high and low hillock structures on an aluminum film, and then changed the surface chemical energy by depositing siloxane vapor, causing the contact angle to reach 169°. The self-jumping of condensed droplets could be observed on the surface using a high-speed camera. Pan et al.53 used the combination of ultrafast laser ablation technology and chemical reaction to prepare a superhydrophobic surface with adjustable gradation levels and good Cassie state stability (Fig. 8(b)). Given that the previous studies only focused on the production of superhydrophobic surfaces and ignored research on the durability of the surface, the authors proposed a new comprehensive criterion. Specifically, the Laplace pressure was employed to evaluate the stability of the Cassie state and the influencing factors (circumference, height, and length of nanorods). A layered superhydrophobic surface with a stable Cassie state can exhibit a good performance in droplet condensation and droplet jumping. Because of its multi-scale structure and stable condensed water state, it has significant anti-icing ability and the surface can remove condensate droplets spontaneously.

Boinovich et al.54 used laser processing fine-tuning and fluorooxysilane deposition to process aluminum metal surfaces. To prevent reversible chemical adsorption on the surface, the interaction between ultraviolet radiation and ozone molecules formed by plasma increased to form a layer of cross-linked hydrophobic molecules on the layered rough structure formed by laser treatment. The results showed that the contact angle reached 171.8° and the sliding angle was less than 1.5°. Long et al.55 used cross-nanosecond laser technology to ablate a copper surface to obtain a micro–nano structure similar to that of broccoli, and then modified it with fluoroalkyl silane to prepare a superhydrophobic micro–nano structure (Fig. 8(c)). The analysis showed that the surface nanostructure was caused by the vaporization and aggregation of copper slag during the ablation process, which after oxidation, floated to the surface. The angular contact meter showed that the contact angle was greater than 160°.
3.3 Etching method
The etching method is a commonly used method for surface processing,56–59 which involves selectively removing particles from the surface of a material via chemical or physical methods. With the development of micro-manufacturing technology, in a broad sense, etching is a general term for removing materials through solution, reactive ion or other mechanical means, and has become a common name for micro-processing manufacturing. Etching is divided into dry etching and wet etching. Wet etching is a pure chemical reaction process. Barthwal et al.60 used hydrochloric acid to etch an aluminum plate and the prepared surface and graphite were anodized to obtain a micro–nano surface with inner pores, and the surface was hydrophobized by thermal vapor deposition (Fig. 9(a)). Observation experiments showed that the contact angle of the surface reached 161° and the sliding angle was as low as 3°. To better adapt to a high humidity and low-temperature environment, the authors injected silicone oil on the surface to increase its ice resistance in special environments.

Peng et al.61 observed that aviation aircraft easily freeze at high altitudes and the efficiency of mechanical or electrical deicing is too low (Fig. 9(b)). Analysis of lubricant injection into the surface will cause damage to the environment near the airport, thus they chose to add micro–nano surfaces. The surface of aluminum alloy was made based on low-surface energy substances. Then the appropriate concentration of hydrochloric acid and low concentration of hydrogen peroxide were chosen for chemical etching. The surface was soaked with stearic acid to generate aluminum stearate to reduce the surface energy. The contact angle was as high as 163.6° and the sliding angle was as low as 5.7°. Under condensation conditions, compared with the untreated aluminum alloy surface, the treated surface could significantly reduce the condensation time of water on its surface.
Zhang et al.62 used electron beam evaporation technology (physical vapor deposition method) to construct spherical microstructures on silicon wafers and produced nano-arrays by etching with a mixed solution of hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Also, a microchip was prepared on the silicon wafer by photolithography and a cube with a side length of 5.5 μm was constructed on the microchip. Also, a nanoarray was constructed in a similar manner. Their experiments proved that under dry conditions, the two silicon wafers reached a contact angle of 150° and sliding angle of less than 10°. However, when the air humidity increased, the hydrophobicity of the surface began to decrease, and thus a mixed etching solution of iso-acetone and potassium hydroxide was used to form a micro-pyramid structure on the surface. Subsequently, a nano-array was constructed to facilitate the migration of tiny droplets (Fig. 9(c)). Experiments proved that the second-level roughness, even in wet conditions, could still maintain droplet mobility and a high contact angle.
3.4 Gel–sol method
The sol–gel method involves using a mixture containing highly chemically active components as precursors, mixing these raw materials uniformly in the liquid phase, and conducting hydrolysis and condensation chemical reactions to form a stable transparent sol system in the solution. The sol slowly polymerizes between the aged colloidal particles to form a gel with a three-dimensional network structure. The gel network is filled with solvents that lose fluidity to form a gel. Finally, the gel is dried, sintered and solidified to prepare molecular and even nano-substructure materials.63
Wu et al.64 added 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (PFOTES)-modified hydrophobized silica nanoparticles to a tetraethyl orthosilicate-3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (TEOS-GLYMO) sol, and then sprayed them on a glass slide with a spray gun and cured by heating to obtain a superhydrophobic film with a contact angle greater than 150° and the sliding angle less than 10°. Simultaneously, by changing the weight ratio of silica nanoparticles modified by PFOTES and unmodified silica nanoparticles in the sol, it was concluded that when the ratio is 6:0, the surface has an excellent ice-proof performance and the adhesion strength is lower than 100 kPa at −20 °C.
Zhao et al.65 used an emulsifier-free polymerization and sol–gel method to prepare superhydrophobic Me-SiO2 and i-Bu-SiO2 copolymer coatings containing raspberry-like micro–nano particles by only adjusting the initial solution (Fig. 10(a)). The content of acrylic acid (AA) can control the morphology of the particles. This is because as the content of AA increases, the number of carboxyl groups on the surface also increases. In the subsequent hydrolysis with the tetraethoxysilane copolymer, more titanium dioxide grew on the surface of the styrene–acrylic acid copolymer particles, forming a perfect raspberry-like structure and promoting the formation of a continuous gas phase in the interstitial part of the silicon nanoparticles. Then, methyltriethoxysilane was used as a surface modifier to convert the raspberry particles from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic. The rough micro–nano structure size promotes air capture, forms a continuous gas phase, and leads to a low contact angle hysteresis.

Hu et al.66 used the sol–gel method to combine the swelling characteristics of cured silicone rubber (SR) to grow a layer of titanium oxide particles on the surface of the SR (Fig. 10(b)). Firstly, the solidified SR was swollen in a butylamine solution for a certain amount of time, and then the swollen SR was immersed in a tetrabromo titanate (TBT)/ethanol solution. The TBT penetrated the cross-linking network of the SR and came into contact with the n-butylamine. The titanium dioxide particles produced in the cross-linked network through the TBT sol–gel reaction gradually grew, and appeared on the surface of the SR, forming multi-scale roughness, and finally was hydrophobized with stearic acid/isopropanol. The grown titanium dioxide particles were “embedded” rather than “coated” on the SR surface, thereby improving the adhesive properties and increasing the mechanical durability.
3.5 Hydrothermal method
The sol–gel method requires high-temperature sintering to obtain a crystalline powder, which increases the risks associated with the experiment. Thus, new methods need to be urgently developed to ensure the safety of researchers. The hydrothermal method refers to a method of preparing materials by dissolving and recrystallizing a powder in a sealed pressure vessel using water as the solvent. Compared with the sol–gel method, this method only requires the temperature to be controlled at 150 °C and the pressure in the range of 0.3–4 MPa to obtain powder crystals with complete development, small particle size, uniform distribution, and low particle agglomeration.67,68
Han et al.69 first used the hydrothermal method to oxidize sodium stannate to obtain tin oxide, which was coated on the surface of glucose-carbonized microspheres (Fig. 11(a)). The tin oxide nanoparticles with a raspberry-like structure were prepared, and then annealed. At this time, the microspheres become carbon dioxide, leaving a hollow structure. In the second step, the raspberry-shaped hollow tin oxide nanoparticles were combined with hydrophilic silica nanoparticles to form an appropriate layered rough structure. Finally, 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodiyltriethylsilane was used to hydrophobize the surface. Adding epoxy resin to the prepared solution can improve the stability and durability of the coating. Through a simple spraying method, it could be applied to various substrates with a contact angle of 165°.

Taghavimandi et al.70 prepared superhydrophobic copper oxide particles via a single-step hydrothermal method. They were mixed and stirred with polytetrafluoroethylene, copper nitrate trihydrate, a structure-directing agent and hexamethylenetetramine, and heated in an autoclave to obtain different-shaped hydrophobic copper oxide particles. The Taguchi experiment was used to control the type and concentration of the structure-directing agent, the reaction time of the solution, and the molar ratio of hexamethylenetetramine to the initial copper ions to prepare superhydrophobic copper oxide particles of different shapes. The key synthesis parameters were evaluated, and it was concluded that the concentration and type of the structure-directing agent had a significant effect on the surface morphology and chemical composition, thereby affecting the wettability of the prepared samples. When the selected structure-directing agent was Tween80, the concentration of the structure-directing agent was 0.3 mM, the synthesis temperature of the solution was 160 °C, and the molar ratio of hexamethylenetetramine to the initial copper ion was 1.5, the optimal contact angle reached 159° and the sliding angle was less than 5°.
Yin et al.71 added zinc oxide particles to a copper substrate via the hydrothermal method. Due to the special nano-needle structure of zinc oxide, the roughness requirements could be well met. Then, the surface energy was reduced using tetrafluoroethylene, achieving a contact angle of 170°. Interestingly, the authors irradiated the prepared superhydrophobic surface under ultraviolet light for 12 and 24 h and found that the surface became a hydrophobic surface and a hydrophilic surface, respectively. This provides certain guidance for the preparation of copper substrates in the field of microelectronics. Fan et al.72 used a hydrothermal method to place dried zinc flakes in a saturated solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and C6H12N4 to make zinc oxide nanotubes grow on a substrate (Fig. 11(b)). The finished product was hydrophobized in 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (FAS)/ethanol solution to obtain a high contact angle of 155°. These researchers also found that if perfluoroalkyl polyether is injected as a lubricating oil into the treated surface, although the contact angle is reduced, the sliding angle will also be significantly reduced, and under the condensation test conditions, the surface had a good antifreeze and corrosion resistance performance. However, in the case of the hydrothermal method, there is a lack of in-depth research on many aspects such as the crystal nucleation process and control of the influencing factors of the crystal growth process, and there are very few experiments in related aspects. Simultaneously, the hydrothermal method also requires high temperature and high pressure steps. The dependence of the hydrothermal method on the reaction conditions is relatively strong, which also affects its widespread use.
3.6 Coating method
The coating method is also a commonly used method for constructing micro–nano structures on the surface of materials.73 Li et al.74 prepared a superhydrophobic surface via the spraying method (Fig. 12(a)). Firstly, silica nanoparticles were mixed with tetraethoxysilane and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorododecyltriethoxysilane (PFDTES) in an acid solution. Finally, the silica suspension was sprayed on the substrate using a spray gun to prepare a superhydrophobic surface. The experiment proved that the contact angle was as high as 171° and the sliding angle was as low as 1.5°. Zhai et al.75 used tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorododecyltriethoxysilane (PFDTES), which underwent hydrolysis and condensation in the presence of MWCNTs at room temperature, to prepare a homogeneous multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT@FluorPOS) suspension. Their studies showed that the wettability and microstructure of the coating were highly dependent on the concentration and diameter of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes. A small amount of TEOS could reduce the sliding angle and adding an appropriate amount of PFDTES after dehydration and condensation improved the durability of the coating. At room temperature, the contact angle reached 172° and the sliding angle was 1°.

(b) Schematic illustration of the fabrication of PVA-SiO2-PDMS composite superhydrophobic coatings.78 This figure has been reproduced from ref. 78 with permission from Elsevier Ltd, Copyright 2020. 
Wang et al.76 added a predetermined amount of carbon nanotubes to a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) solution and rotated it at 600 rpm for 15 min to obtain a homogeneous mixture. Then, the mixture was combined with a curing agent and cured in a vacuum at room temperature for 12 h. The prepared nano-composite film layer was 0.3 mm, with good structural flexibility, adjustable resistance, and a contact angle of 152.7°. Mohammad Amin Sarshar et al.77 applied an acrylic-based polymer solution on an aluminum substrate as an adhesive layer, sprayed hydrophobic silica nanoparticles in ethanol on the top layer, and controlled the texture of the top paint by changing the distance between the spray gun and the substrate. Their study found that when the micro-roughness was 20 μm and the nano-roughness was 100 nm, the surface had a contact angle of 162° and sliding angle of 9°. Especially in a dynamic environment, the surface also had a good ice resistance and de-icing performance. Gong et al.78 prepared large-scale superhydrophobic surfaces via a simple spraying method (Fig. 12(b)). By spraying a mixed solution of water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), glycerin and hydrophilic silicon nanoparticles on the surface, a rough structure was formed. Secondly, a layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was sprayed on the surface of the particles in the same way for hydrophobization, which could improve the mechanical strength of the surface and protect the bottom layer simultaneously. The surface contact angle of the prepared coating was 160°. Most importantly, the prepared superhydrophobic coating could be easily removed, and once the hydrophobicity was no longer needed, the substrate could be reused.
Wang et al.79 prepared SiO2-ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) suspensions, which could be easily coated on various substrates by controlling the mass ratio of silica to UHMWPE, adding dehydrated naphthalene to the solution, and heating and drying. UHMWPE has excellent impact strength, high wear resistance and low friction, and thus it has been widely used in biological materials. Simultaneously, UHMWPE also acts as a binder between nanoparticles, which can increase the adhesion and the robustness of the coating. Experiments have verified that when the mass ratio of silica to ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene is 6, it has excellent contact angle and friction resistance. The contact angle is 170° before rubbing, and it is still as high as about 160° after rubbing. By injecting perfluorotripentylamine (FC-70), kerosene or silicone oil into a solid superhydrophobic surface, a porous surface-injected synovial fluid is obtained, in which water droplets can move smoothly at low temperatures, indicating excellent anti-icing ability.
3.7 Vapor deposition method
Vapor deposition technology uses physical and chemical processes in the gas phase to form functional or decorative metal, non-metal or compound coatings on the surface of a workpiece. According to the film forming mechanism, vapor deposition technology can be divided into chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and physical vapor deposition (PVD).
Chemical vapor deposition refers to the method in which chemical gases or steam react to synthesize coatings or nanomaterials on the surface of a substrate, which is the traditional technique employed for the preparation of thin films. Its principle is to use gaseous precursor reactants through atomic and molecular chemical reactions to make certain components in the gaseous precursor decompose, forming a thin film on the substrate.
Zhang et al.80 used a floating catalyst deposition method to prepare the surface of carbon nanotubes, in which xylene was the carbon source and ferrocene was used as the catalyst. The two were placed in a furnace and heated at 760 °C. Hydrogen and argon were used as carriers gas, and then carbon nanotubes (CNT) were grown on a stainless steel plate etched by acid. A thin layer of perfluoro-1-dodecene (PF) was applied to the surface of the CNT to change the chemical properties of their surface. The experimental results showed that the contact angle reached 165°. Guo et al.81 reported the preparation of mechanically stable and self-healing superhydrophobic surfaces via aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) using epoxy resin and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) shape memory polymer (Fig. 13(a)). After depositing at a suitable dynamic temperature (from 290 °C to 350 °C during deposition at a rate of 3 °C min−1), micro–nano hierarchical roughness structures on the glass were formed. The roughness structure combined with the low-surface energy substance, PDMS, imparted superhydrophobicity to the coated glass.

(b) Schematic representation of the system used for the preparation of films with a laterally graded surface density of Ag NPs and experimental setup used for the deposition of a C:F overcoating.83 This figure has been reproduced from ref. 83 with permission from Elsevier Ltd, Copyright 2019. (c) Schematic of the plasma treatment jet.84 This figure has been reproduced from ref. 84 with permission from Elsevier B. V, Copyright 2019. 
In physical vapor deposition technology, under vacuum conditions, physical methods are used to vaporize the material source-solid or liquid surface into gaseous atoms, and molecules or parts are ionized into ions, and through a low-pressure gas (or plasma) process, a film is deposited the surface of the substrate with special function film technology. Zuo et al.82 roughened a zinc surface by radio frequency magnetron sputtering, and used HDTMS (a siloxane coupling agent), G502 (a partially fluorinated siloxane coupling agent), FAS-17 (a fully fluorinated siloxane coupling agent), and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to modify the prepared substrates. Consequently, the contact angle obtained was significantly higher than 160° and the sliding angle was higher than that after PDMS modification, which is about 10°, whereas that with the other modifiers was generally lower than 5°. It was found that after modification with FAS-17, compared with the other chemical modifications, the surface of FAS-17 had good anti-icing/frosting ability. KratochvÍl et al.83 used the gas gathering source of argon nanoparticles and radio frequency magnetron sputtering technology of hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene to prepare a hydrophobic film (Fig. 13(b)). Firstly, the Ag substrate was bombarded by a gas polymerization source, and the produced silver nanoparticles were deposited on the polished silicon wafer. During the deposition process, different deposition speeds could be selected by controlling the mask speed. Then, the silicon wafer prepared in the first step was placed in the same position, and the fluorocarbon polymer was used as an ion source to bombard the silicon wafer to prepare a superhydrophobic film. The thickness of the film was controlled at 6 ± 1 nm. On the one hand, the stability of the coating increased with an increase in the thickness of the fluorocarbon under a wet environment. On the other hand, the nanostructure could be retained on the surface.
3.8 Plasma treatment
The use of plasma to roughen the surface of materials has become a common method in recent years.85 Because of its simple and efficient process, it can carry out targeted operations even for complex profile structures, which has attracted widespread attention. The polymer processed by the plasma process can directly produce micro–nano structures. Plasma technology involves the use of a plasma surface treatment machine to carry out certain physical and chemical modifications on the surface of a material, causing the modified surface to show a certain degree of wettability under high humidity conditions. Plasma treatment generally includes plasma etching and plasma polymerization and has been widely used in the field of wetting.
Plasma etching is the process of using ion bombardment to etch the surface of a material. Yue et al.86 used reactive ion etching to prepare the silicon surface of micropillars and etched cubic and cylindrical structures by changing the photolithography mask. Experiments showed that the contact angle reached about 140°. Simultaneously, the authors added black carbon nanoparticles to the structure of the cylinder and found that the contact angle reached 147°.
Plasma polymerization refers to the use of high temperature, high pressure and electricity to polymerize plasma on the surface of a material. Maghsoudi et al.87 used plasma polymerization to prepare a rubber surface as a superhydrophobic surface. Rubber was chosen as the substrate because it exhibits good self-healing properties. The experimental results showed that as the temperature decreased, the contact angle of the sample prepared by plasma polymerization remained stable in a small range. This may be due to the lower surface roughness, and the droplets could be completely lifted on the surface.
Vazirinasab et al.84 used plasma jet technology to produce micro- and nano-structured surface roughness on a low-surface-energy, high-temperature vulcanized silicone rubber substrate, resulting in a hydrostatic contact angle of 160° and contact angle hysteresis of less than 3° (Fig. 13(c)). By increasing the reference voltage, the size of the nanoclusters will increase and begin to merge. As a result, the space between the clusters is reduced, and a micro-rough structure is produced on the substrate. The trapped air pockets in the microstructures and nanostructures help reduce the adhesion of water droplets to the surface and improve the water-resistance of the substrate.
3.9 Other methods
The above-mentioned methods can be roughly divided into three types, namely, physical methods,88,89 chemical methods,90 and physical and chemical methods.91 However, with the development of science and technology in recent years, some new methods have emerged in an endless stream, and more and more are applied to the production of micro/nano structures on superhydrophobic surfaces. More importantly, these methods may solve the problems of some special materials or special conditions in the manufacturing process of superhydrophobic surfaces.
Stevens et al.92 grew carbon nanotubes directly on the surface of silicon or stainless steel by using the effect of carbon nanotubes infiltrating the amorphous carbon on the upper layer of multi-walled nanotubes. The material used was ethylene. The catalytic cracking method was used to add Ar and C2H4 gases at a temperature of 800 °C to achieve the growth of carbon nanotubes, and certain vacuum treatment was performed. The contact angles obtained were all greater than 160°. Chu et al.93 vacuum-filtered a graphene oxide suspension onto a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane, reduced it to a redox graphene membrane with HI acid, and then used 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorododecyl trichloride silane to modify the graphene film (Fig. 14(a)). To produce micro wrinkles on the surface, the redox graphene film was placed on a substrate plate, and the corresponding pre-tightening force was applied around it to change the surface structure of the graphene film. Also, using the Stöber method to grow silica nanoparticles on the graphene film, data observations showed that the contact angle was as high as 162°.

(c) Collecting device of carbon nanoparticles and method for the preparation of super-hydrophobic surface.97 This figure has been reproduced from ref. 97 with permission from the American Chemical Society, Copyright 2021. 
Hoque et al.94 developed a simple, fast and scalable stamping method. Definite hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions could be formed on materials of any size. A hybrid surface was prepared by coating hydrophobized polydimethylsiloxane on the surface of the microtip. Experiments of droplet jumping caused by atmospheric vapor condensation and merging showed that the superhydrophobic mixed surface had global superhydrophobicity and local hydrophilicity. Compared with a uniform superhydrophobic surface, the performance of multi-droplet jumping improved by nearly 14 times.
However, achieving an ice-proof performance and ultra-low ice adhesion in a humid environment is still a challenge. This is because icing will occur on the hierarchical structure of the surface and the adhesion of ice is relatively large. Liu et al.95 combined a superhydrophobic copper mesh with a polyvinyl alcohol-based organic gel to control the secretion rate of antifreeze by changing the amount of carboxylic acid, borax content and temperature (Fig. 14(b)). The surface not only exhibited an excellent anti-frost performance in a humid atmosphere, but also could repeatedly remove spontaneously deposited ice (8 Pa) due to the ultra-low ice adhesion.
Carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) have been considered as essential components for various applications including sensors, quantum dots, electrocatalysts, energy storage, lubrication, and functional coatings.96 Yang et al.97 prepared a rotary deposition and separation system that could efficiently produce low-cost carbon nanoparticles (Fig. 14(c)). By adjusting the system parameters, the characteristics of the carbon nanoparticles could be controlled. The prepared carbon nanoparticles were immersed in a solution of stearic acid and ethanol, and finally dispersed and sprayed on a substrate with a PDMS film under heating conditions to prepare a superhydrophobic surface with anti-icing properties. Lin et al.98 also used candles to prepare carbon nanoparticles and adhered them to a surface. The difference is that the latter was prepared via a two-step method. In the first step, the prepared particles were incorporated in uncured PDMS to build a micron structure, and in the second step, a direct deposition method was employed to directly place the glass sample prepared in the first step. Heating above the flame not only cured the PDMS, but also collected nano-scale particles.
4. Ice-proof and icephobicity strategies
4.1 Theoretical aspects of icing formation
The second and third chapters mainly introduced the anti-icing surfaces prepared by modern processing technology inspired by the different microstructures of cold-resistant biological surfaces. However, understanding the formation and growth of ice can allow better exploration of the ice-proof properties of solid surfaces. In the natural environment, it is generally believed that when the temperature is below 0 °C, liquids will undergo a phase change from liquid to solid. The crystallization of ice consists of three main processes, namely, the excessive coldness of the ice, the formation of the core and the growth of the core. The shape of the crystal core and development of the crystal core are determined by the thermodynamic and kinetic conditions, respectively. The construction of crystal cores can be divided into initial nucleation and secondary nucleation, and initial nucleation can be divided into homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation. Initial nucleation refers to the system that does not contain any crystalline matter in the nucleus, where if the formed nucleus is free of water molecules in an overcooling solution, uniform aggregation is called homogenization, or if the external factors disturbing the water molecules are uneven, the optimal and concentrated nucleation is called hetero-phase nucleation.

4.1.1 Homogeneous nucleation. 
In general, the thermodynamic driving force for crystallization is the minimization of free energy (Fig. 15(a)). Specifically, crystallization occurs because the chemical potential gambient of a growth unit in the ambient mother phase is higher than the chemical potential gcrystal in the crystalline phase.124 The difference between the chemical potentials gambient and gcrystal is given by Δg = gambient − gcrysta(1)

In ice crystallization, which is a phase transition process, the thermodynamic driving force for crystallization is primarily contributed by supercooling ΔT (ΔT = Tm − T, where T denotes the actual temperature and Tm is the melting temperature).125 The chemical potential change of crystallization is given by Hm (2)where ΔHm denotes the enthalpy of melting per molecule and Tm is the melting temperature.
In a supercooled/supersaturated system, the growth unit in the ambient phase has a higher chemical potential than that in the bulk crystal. By transferring the growth unit from the ambient phase to the bulk crystal phase, the free energy of the system is lowered by Δg, as indicated by eqn (1). However, the free energy difference between the bulk unit and surface unit gives rise to the surface free energy or surface tension. Due to the surface free energy, the formation of a surface leads to a positive addition to the overall free energy. Thus, the free energy change associated with the formation of a crystalline nucleus is the sum of the decreasing bulk crystal free energy and the increasing surface free energy, as follows:124 ΔG1 = −nΔg + ϕn(3)
Ideally, it is assumed that the probability of forming a critical nucleus is uniform throughout the system, which is homogeneous nucleation. For spherical nuclei with a radius R, one has n = 4πR3pc/3 and ϕn = 4πR2y can be expressed as follows: (4)where Pc is the particle number density of the nuclei and g is the surface free energy area density. According to eqn (4), it is clear that the nucleation process is regulated by the competition between the decreasing bulk crystal free energy and the increasing surface free energy. As a result of this competition, ΔG has a maximum  at R = Rc. Mathematically,  and Rc are defined by . The results are represented by: (5)where  and Rc are the so-called nucleation barrier and critical size, respectively. The nucleation barrier must be overcome to form a stable crystalline phase.124


4.1.2 Heterogeneous nucleation. 
In practice, nucleation is usually promoted by the presence of foreign matter, such as the wall of the solution container, foreign matter particles, and matrix. The presence of foreign matter generally reduces the free energy of the interface (or surface), thereby lowering the nucleation barrier.126 Therefore, nucleation occurs preferentially near or on foreign objects, and this process is called heterogeneous nucleation. The influence of foreign matter on lowering the nucleation barrier can be quantified by the interface correlation factor, f(R, θ), which is defined as follows: (6)
The parameter f(R, θ) is a function of the water droplet static contact angle (θ) and surface roughness radius of the curvature (R) where heterogeneous nucleation can take place, and the value of f varies from 0 to 1.125 (7)where the variables of σI, σW and σIW denote the ice-gas, water–gas, and ice-water interfacial tensions, respectively.
Also, because σW is much smaller than σI, the free energy required for heterogeneous nucleation is: (8)
Since the contact angle between the crystal nucleus and the substrate is 0° ≤ θ ≤ 180°, 0 ≤ f(θ) ≤ 1, which can be obtained as follows: (9)
It can be seen from the above-mentioned formula that the energy required for heterogeneous nucleation is always less than or equal to the energy required for homogeneous nucleation, and thus in general, heterogeneous nucleation is easier than homogeneous nucleation (Fig. 15(b)).


4.1.3 The formation of ice bridges. 
Research has proven that the ice bridge is not transferred immediately after a droplet is completely frozen, where some time passes before the ice bridge starts to transfer.128 This is because the liquid droplet absorbs the latent heat of phase change during the freezing process and the temperature rises to ∼0 °C.129 After the liquid droplet is completely frozen, its own temperature is still high.130 The frozen liquid droplet will exchange heat with the low-temperature surface, and then the temperature will gradually decrease to the wall temperature. In this process, because the ice surface temperature is higher than the surrounding air temperature, the surface water vapor partial pressure is still higher than the surface vapor pressure of the surrounding supercooled droplets, and thus ice bridges cannot be formed and propagated at this stage.127
When the temperature of the frozen droplet is reduced to the wall temperature, due to its low surface water vapor partial pressure (lower than the surface water vapor pressure of the adjacent droplet) and driven by the water vapor pressure difference, the frozen droplet quickly grows an ice bridge and moves towards and pass the adjacent droplets (Fig. 15(c)). There are roughly three situations in which the ice bridge propagates. The first situation is that the ice bridge spreads to the target droplet and induces the droplet to freeze. When the target droplet is large enough or the distance between the two droplets is relatively close, most of the ice bridge will complete the transfer and touch the target droplet. Under normal circumstances, most of the ice bridge spreads in this way. The second situation is the suspension of the ice bridge transfer process. Given that the ice bridge spreads on the surface in a mesh structure and has a certain randomness, the target droplet is first touched by other ice bridges and frozen during the propagation process of the ice bridge to the target droplet. At this time, the ice bridge loses its propagation. The power source of water vapor stops transmitting. The third situation is that the target droplet completely evaporates during the propagation of the ice bridge. When the target droplet size is small or far away from the front of the ice bridge, the droplets evaporate continuously during the propagation process of the ice bridge and even evaporate completely before the ice bridge arrives. At this time, the ice bridge also stops transmitting. This situation is more common on superhydrophobic surfaces because the size of the droplets on the superhydrophobic surface is small and their distribution is relatively sparse, and many tiny droplets will be completely evaporated during the propagation of the ice bridge.

4.2 Delayed freezing time
Delaying the freezing time of surface droplets is a very effective method.131–134 This can be removed in time before the surface is completely frozen, significantly reducing the cost of passive deicing. The delay time of droplet freezing is generally from the time when the droplet falls on a hard substrate to the peak at the top of the droplet.135 Thus far, studies have found that many potential factors can affect the freezing time of water droplets. For example, surface roughness, heat transfer efficiency between the substrate and droplet, surface energy, and interface energy barrier of the nucleating droplet.136–138 Through verification, it is currently mainly affected by surface roughness and surface energy. The roughness improvement method was introduced in detail in the previous section. The surface energy is currently roughly classified into low surface energy substances containing fluorine, silicon, silicon fluorine, and organic matter.139–142

4.2.1 Fluoride-containing polymer coatings. 
Among the fluoride-containing polymer coatings, perfluoropolyether (PFPE) is the most commonly used low-surface energy material. Researchers often adhere it to the surface of substrates through methods such as immersion, spraying, and deposition. Marta Fenero et al.137 chemically etched an aluminum surface with a simple ferric chloride solution to construct layered micro/nano structures. Then, PFPE was grafted on the corrugated aluminum surface to reduce its surface free energy. In the experiment to verify its ice-proof performance, compared with the smooth perfluoropolyether modifier, the corrugated treatment significantly increased the freezing time by more than six times. Compared with the original aluminum substrate, the freezing time was delayed by nearly 20 times. The combined effect of surface texture and low-surface-energy substances created an air layer on the surface and reduced the thermal conductivity.
Zhiping Zuo et al.143 prepared a superhydrophobic zinc oxide surface via RF magnetron sputtering and surface modification of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (FAS-17). To verify that the surface has a good ice-proof performance, a permanent room temperature vulcanized (PRTV) substrate was used in the comparative experiment. The study found that at a temperature of −10 °C, no self-transfer phenomenon was observed on the surface of the PRTV-coated glass (Fig. 16(a)). However, a self-transfer phenomenon occurred on the surface of the prepared superhydrophobic zinc oxide and some minor water droplets merged and jumped out of the surface, resulting in delayed surface freezing. The authors analyzed that due to the existence of the surface air layer, the nucleation of water droplets was greatly delayed. Also, due to the presence of low-surface substances, the droplets could transfer by themselves.

(c) Freezing process of a water droplet on the sample surface. During the measurement, the temperature is −10 °C and the humidity is 40%.149 This figure has been reproduced from ref. 149 with permission from Elsevier B. V, Copyright 2020. 
Wei Tang et al.144 prepared stainless steel micro–nano structures by laser etching and modified them with a fluorine-containing diamond-like coating to produce a superhydrophobic surface. In the anti-icing experiments, when the temperature dropped, especially below the dew point, the droplets started to condense on the micro/nano structure. Considering that the critical nucleation size is much smaller than the micro/nano structure gap, the contact surface of the tiny condensate droplet became a plane, and the effect of the micro/nano rough structure on reducing the actual contact area disappeared. The contact angle at this time was 99.8°. As more condensed droplets covered the surface, tiny isolated droplets gathered, grew and merged, then wetting the entire surface. In this way, the gas film was reduced and the Cassie–Baxter state gradually changed to the Wenzel state. The reduction of the gas film reduced the thermal resistance effect of air. In addition, the nucleation sites of ice crystals increased, thereby decreasing the freezing time and freezing delay time, and weakening the anti-icing ability of the superhydrophobic surface. Therefore, ensuring the stability of the air layer has become the key to delaying surface icing.


4.2.2 Silicide-containing polymer coatings. 
In recent years, the wide use of polymer coatings containing silicon have significantly increased. This is because compared to fluoride, silicide is not potentially hazardous to the environment. Gaojian Lin et al.145 produced carbon nanoparticles with a diameter of 20–30 nm through a simple flame synthesis process, and then transferred them on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix, finally coating a surface. Experiments proved that by depositing carbon nanoparticles on the surface of PDMS, a small and constant contact area is produced. This results in minor heat loss and it is difficult for the condensed droplets to transfer heat to the substrate. This also explains the fact that the freezing rate of condensed water on the carbon nanoparticle coating is much slower. Also, the PDMS film was used for hydrophobic treatment. Sun et al.146 employed a laser etching machine to process microstructures on a cured PDMS/carbon nanotube wire (CNW) template to obtain a bionic superhydrophobic surface. To verify that the microstructure and the low surface energy substances jointly affected the ice-proof effect of the surface, a wild nanocomposite film and a smooth nanocomposite film were prepared. Experiments showed that the rough nanocomposite film started to freeze significantly after 15 minutes (Fig. 16(b)). In contrast, there was basically no freezing in the center of the uneven surface. Ice/frost could only grow from the edges of the film. This is because the micro-pillar structure on the surface of the wild nanocomposite film trapped air and reduced the number of nucleation points.
Huang et al.147 used hexamethyldisilazane (HMDSN) as a polymerization precursor and an argon atmospheric pressure plasma jet source to prepare a superhydrophobic surface through a chemical vapor deposition process. The material analysis showed that the superhydrophobicity of the prepared film was caused by its uniform micro–nano surface structure and large number of chemical components such as methyl functional groups. The latter provides a lower free energy for the film. The icing delay time of the prepared film was about six-times that of the bare surface.


4.2.3 Fluorine-containing silane polymer coatings. 
The use of silicon-containing low-surface-energy substances alone cannot achieve satisfactory results. Thus, researchers proposed to gradually increase the content of silicon based on fluorine to achieve excellent ice-proof effects. Saffar et al.148 processed a micron structure on a copper substrate via laser technology. Secondly, a zinc oxide layer was deposited on the surface of the processed copper substrate by immersion plating, and then heated and cured to increase the adhesion of the zinc oxide layer. Finally, to reduce the surface energy of the micro–nano structure, the sample was immersed in a solution of composite silica nanoparticles and polytetrafluoroethylene polymer. The polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coating had high corrosion resistance, mechanical stability, and excellent durability. The silica particles optimized the surface roughness, and thus that the surface could wrap the air layer, reducing the efficiency of heat transfer between liquid and solid. The experimental results proved that the deposition of the superhydrophobic coating increased the freezing time on the copper substrate from 70 s to 500 s. Compared with the uncoated copper substrate, the copper-coated ice structure underwent significant changes. Qi et al.149 used a non-solvent-induced phase separation method to disperse fluorine-modified titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide in a styrene acrylonitrile solution and coated the solution evenly on etched acrylonitrile–styrene–acrylate (ASA). The surface of the resin was cured by heating. Through the simultaneous utilization of fluorine-modified titanium dioxide and fumed silica, micro/nano structures and organic layers were prepared, and super solid hydrophobicity was obtained. Based on the successful preparation of super hydrophobicity, excellent ice resistance was achieved. A contact angle of 161° and a cool delay time of 93 min were observed (Fig. 16(c)).
Xie et al.138 used zinc acetate hydrothermal treatment on an aluminum substrate to etch micro–nano structures on the surface of the aluminum substrate, and then modified it with fluoroalkylsilane. Experiments showed that the superhydrophobic surface conformed to the Cassie–Baxter wetting model, had a good freezing delay performance, and the freezing time was greater than 500 s. The pre-cooling time (before ice nucleation) accounted for almost 90% of the total freezing time. This shows that although the presence of micro–nano cones will aggravate surface heterogeneous nucleation, the air layer can isolate heat transfer and delay the time of ice nucleation, resulting in higher ice delay characteristics.

4.3 Droplets bouncing and shedding
The aforementioned ice-proof strategy only delays the accumulation of condensed droplets on the surface,150–152 it does not fundamentally solve the problem of surface ice accumulation. Thus, anti-icing strategies by promoting the bouncing of droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces have attracted increasing attention.153–155 Thus far, these surfaces can be roughly divided into square grooves, V-shaped grooves and irregular structures.156,157

4.3.1 Square groove surfaces. 
Reducing the contact time of water droplets on non-wetting surfaces has excellent potential in the field of anti-icing, gradually developing into a hot topic in the field of wetting surfaces. Lian et al.151 used aluminum alloy steel wire electrical discharge machining technology to successfully prepare a bionic plane and convex surface with a double-layer and three-layer structure, and then sprayed hydrophobic nanoparticles to achieve excellent superhydrophobic properties. By comparing the bounce behavior of water droplets on the surface of these different square grooves, the best structure spacing, width and height influence on the contact time were obtained. This study found that the contact time of water droplets on the double-layer structure is the longest, and the contact time on the three-layer structure is the shortest. It was verified that the square groove can promote the bouncing of droplets (Fig. 17(a)).

The jumping angle and speed of droplets under different width ratios.159 This figure has been reproduced from ref. 159 with permission from the American Chemical Society, Copyright 2020. 
In terms of promoting the bouncing of droplets, it is also an excellent way to control the bounce direction of droplets. Liu et al.158 studied the bouncing of water droplets on a superhydrophobic surface composed of circular equidistant square grooves. The cover was made of aluminum alloy by micro-milling the surface of concentric annular square grooves. To make the surface superhydrophobic, a uniform mixture of zinc oxide nanoparticles and stearic acid solution was chosen to coat the surface. The experiment verified the influence of geometric parameters such as the width of the square groove, height of the groove and initial polarity distance on the bounce of the droplet direction.
Feng et al.159 restricted the growth of droplets through space and used rationally designed grooves. The Laplace pressure difference on both sides of the droplet was controlled to achieve the jumping of the droplet. The method of chemical oxidation was used to etch copper oxide nanosheets on a copper substrate. To realize the hydrophobicity of the surface, heptafluorodecyltrimethoxysilane was deposited on the surface. Using picosecond laser technology, square grooves of different widths (160–570 μm) and depths (160–1800 μm) were ablated on the surface. Studies showed that the best aspect ratio of the grooves was 1.6–5, which could achieve the fastest and the most effective single drop jump, and simultaneously to achieve the directional jump of the droplet, an asymmetric groove was used (Fig. 17(b)). To increase the jumping speed of the droplets, two hydrophobic plates that were not laser-treated were placed in a V shape, which stretched the height of the droplets, resulting in a higher conversion efficiency (Fig. 18(b)).

(b) Self-jumping of the droplet in V-shaped grooves. Self-transportation of droplets in V-shaped grooves.159 This figure has been reproduced from ref. 159 with permission from the American Chemical Society, Copyright 2020. 


4.3.2 V-shaped groove surfaces. 
To improve the efficiency of jumping-droplet condensation, inspired by the phenomenon of spontaneous movement of growing droplets in a superhydrophobic V-shaped groove, Han et al.15 proposed a layered superhydrophobic surface that promotes merger-induced jumping. A V-shaped trough with a width of 5 μm and a height of 15 μm was prepared by electrochemical deposition.
The surface was modified with fluorinated silane. Compared with the traditional superhydrophobic surface, this surface increased the induced frequency by 17 times and the cumulative volume of jumps by 1.8 times. The prepared surface shows great potential (Fig. 18(a)).
Zhao et al.16 studied the effects of water droplet condensation and self-propelled jumping on promoting and preventing the accumulation of droplets. Using simple ultrafast laser processing, microstructures with different V-shaped sizes were designed and manufactured, followed by chemical etching and low surface energy modification. After condensing and merging, the water droplets could jump on their own on the superhydrophobic aluminum surface. The timely jumping of the condensate droplets greatly delayed the formation of surface frost and promoted the anti-icing performance of the surface.


4.3.3 Irregular surfaces. 
Chu et al.160 believed that in the natural environment, it is more practical to not only rely on the shedding of water vapor condensation, but also to consider the bouncing and shedding of the formed droplets. They believed that directional rebound control is also helpful in anti-icing applications with significant meaning. They moved a reduced graphene oxide film to a biaxial pre-stretching device with a pre-strain force of 400%. By controlling the sequence of the pulling force, two types of regular high-low structure (RSGF) and irregular spiral structure (ISGF) graphene-based pleated superhydrophobic films were prepared, and then the Stöber method was used to obtain a silica-reduced graphene oxide film. The experimental and numerical simulation results showed that the regularity of the wrinkle structure could be used to adjust the viscous force distribution between the film and the droplet, and the movement of the droplet rebound force could be controlled. The regular surface rebounded vertically (Fig. 19(a and b)), and the irregular surface always pressed the green arrow (Fig. 19(c and d)). The direction of the mark bounced, and thus the direction of the water drop could be controlled by adjusting the angle of the film. Thus, these results provide another solution to the problem of anti-icing.

Not only could the square groove significantly reduce the contact time of the bouncing droplets with the supercooled surface, but experiments proved that droplets on the irregular superhydrophobic surface can also be ejected from the surface in a short time. Huang et al.161 used a spray method to prepare a superhydrophobic surface on a polyurethane film. This film dramatically reduced the contact time of impact droplets. Studies have proven that the Weber number (We) of the surface has a more significant impact on the bounce contact time of the droplet.

4.4 Reducing the adhesion of condensed ice
The above-mentioned two ice-proof strategies only delay or prevent the accumulation of ice on the surface. In recent years, anti-icing strategies for reducing the adhesion of condensed ice on the surface have received increasing attention.162,163 A lower ice adhesion allows the ice to be released from the surface with time under the action of wind or gravity.164 Thus far, researchers have generally used the method of adding a layer of fats to the condensed liquid droplet and the solid surface to reduce the adhesion.165–167 According to the different lubricants, they can be roughly divided into water lubricants and oil lubricants.168,169

4.4.1 Lubricating oil surfaces. 
Wu et al.170 injected mineral oil into the nanochannels of anodized aluminum under vacuum. Nanopores with a high aspect ratio were processed via two electropolishing techniques, and then mineral oil was injected into the anodized alumina (AOO) through a self-made device (Fig. 20(a and b)). Low-temperature scanning electron microscopy showed that the lubricant was completely injected, and the surface was observed. In terms of contact angle and sliding angle, the lubricating oil injection sample showed better water resistance than the bare AOO matrix, especially after fluoroalkylsilane treatment (Fig. 20(c and d)), where a relatively thick nanoporous substrate and significant lubricant stored in the hole were observed. The combination of lubricating oil is conducive to the corrosion resistance and self-healing performance of the surface model. In the experiment testing the adhesion of the lubricant surface, the sample was tilted 10°, and it was observed that water droplets could slip off in a short time.

(d) Drop experiment on the surface of bare aluminum and anodized aluminum.170 This figure has been reproduced from ref. 170 with permission from Elsevier, Copyright 2019. 
Wang et al.171 used the sacrificial template method and peanut oil immersion to prepare porous polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Using sodium chloride as the medium, soaking in PDMS, heating and curing, and heating with 70 °C hot water to remove sodium chloride crystals resulted in the formation of a porous interconnected PDMS template in the vacuum chamber, and then peanut oil was injected into the holes and lubricating oil at low temperature. Solidification could maintain a long ice repellency performance and the solidified lubricant did not decrease with the liquid flow on the surface (Fig. 21(a and b)). When testing the anti-icing performance of the sample, by controlling the quality of sodium chloride particles in the solution to dissolve PDMS films of different roughness, the study found that as the mass of dissolved sodium chloride increased, the prepared PDMS film became porous. As the rate of this process increased (Fig. 21(c)), the bonding of surface ice decreased. Fig. 21(d) highlights the ultra-low adhesion of ice on the surface with lubricating oil. In the durability test, although the adhesion of ice increased with the number of icing/de-icing cycles, it was always lower than 20 kPa, showing excellent ice-proof ability (Fig. 21(e)).

The above-mentioned methods all use a single way to prepare micron or nanostructures, but it is difficult to ensure the durability of the surface. Durability is one of the major problems faced by lubricants injected into the surface because porous micro–nano structures are usually very fragile and the lubricant stored inside is limited, resulting in an icing/de-icing cycle, where the surface oil film is easily carried and the anti-icing performance of the surface is significantly reduced. Thus, Tan et al.172 proposed a method of injecting a lubricant into the surface using porous nanostructures and micro-pyramid pores. Firstly, a square array pattern was etched on a silicon substrate by photolithography, then cone silicon holes were etched with potassium hydroxide and isopropanol aqueous solution, and then 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl-trichlorosilane (TiO2@FOTS) dispersant was sprayed on the sample plate to form a nanometer structure. Finally, in a vacuum environment, the lubricant was injected into the surface. The porous nanostructure retained the lubricant and the strong micro-cone ensured the long life of the lubricant film and mechanical strength of the surface structure, which increased the durability of the surface. In the durability test, it could be seen that after 20 icing/deicing cycles of lubricating oil injected into the surface of the micro–nano structure, the surface still maintained low adhesion, which proved its excellent anti-icing ability.


4.4.2 Water-lubricated surfaces. 
Guo et al.173 combined photothermal carbon nanofibers with amphiphilic silicon materials based on hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) segments. PVP is hydrophilic and can strongly bind a large number of water molecules to inhibit the formation of hydrogen bond networks. PDMS has a low surface energy and carbon nanofibers can improve the efficiency of light-to-heat, thus achieving the effect of rapid deicing. Compared with the bare base, the adhesion strength of ice on the treated surface was less than 18 kPa, which could be easily removed by natural wind.
Liang et al.174 prepared an anti-icing coating based on a super-hydrophilic polyzwitterionic brush. Poly-sulfobetaine methacrylate (PSBMA) brushes were synthesized via surface-initiated atom-transferred radical polymerization to create super-hydrophilic films on silicon wafers (Fig. 22(a)). The thickness of the PSBMA brush film increased linearly with the polymerization time, and the film remained super-hydrophilic in a non-associated state when the thickness was less than ∼100 nm. Different from traditional polyelectrolytes, polyzwitterions are a type of charged polymer that carries a positive charge and a negative charge in each repeating unit, forming a strong dipole. At −20 °C, the coating showed a low ice adhesion strength of 60 kPa (Fig. 22(b)). However, the application of polyzwitterions in anti-icing materials has not been explored to date.

Chen et al.175 were inspired by mollusk mucus secretion and introduced a dynamic interface of an organic hydrogel. This surface could undergo reversible conversion of water and lubricants at low temperatures, resulting in special anti-frost, anti-stick and deicing properties with long-term durability. The organic hydrogel dynamic interface (ODI) was prepared via the solvent displacement method, and cryoprotectant (CPT) was introduced in various hard gel coatings. The CPT secreted from the network structure of ODI will produce an antifreeze lubricating layer, thereby producing anti-blocking in cold environments. This is because ODI is hydrophilic, only actively secreting CPTs to the surface frost/ice, but also continuously capturing water from the humid environment. This is similar to injecting antifreeze into three-dimensional network structures. Yamazaki et al.176 used a layered spraying method to prepare a three-dimensional network structure with high transparency (Fig. 23(a)), low ice bonding strength and good frost resistance. Cations (polyethyleneimine) and anions (silica) were sprayed alternately on the substrate to make the substrate hydrophilic (Fig. 23(b)). Ethylene glycol (EG) was then injected into the surface as antifreeze. With an increase in the number of double layers and the injection of antifreeze, the antifreeze performance of the surface significantly improved. The adhesion strength of ice was lower than 17 kPa and the frost was delayed for at least 90 min (Fig. 23(c and d)).

5. Durability of ice-proof surfaces
In the previous two chapters, we introduced in detail the preparation of superhydrophobic anti-icing surface micro–nano structures and surface anti-icing strategies. A superhydrophobic surface is mainly composed of ideal micro–nano structures and low-surface energy material modification.11,177,178 However, in real life, whether the superhydrophobic surface has a good passive anti-icing effect is related to whether the superhydrophobic material can be widely used.179 The durability of superhydrophobic surfaces is an inevitable topic. Mechanical weakness, chemical corrosion, ultraviolet light exposure, etc. will seriously damage the stability of superhydrophobic surfaces.180 Thus, to better understand the application of superhydrophobic ice-proof surfaces in the passive anti-icing area, here we conduct an in-depth analysis of the durability of coating surfaces.181,182 In real life, whether it is liquid droplets liquefying on the surface or hitting the surface at high speed from high altitude, some of the water droplets will penetrate into the internal texture structure. In a low temperature environment, water droplets condense into ice cores.183,184 Moreover, once a layer of ice accumulates on the surface, it is difficult to remove it manually. If mechanical removal is forced, the micro–nano structures on the surface will be permanently damaged as the ice layer is removed.
Currently, there are numerous methods to test the durability of superhydrophobic ice-proof surfaces. The two most common ways are through linear pressure wear and water impact under high pressure (Fig. 24(a)). Experimental evidence shows that the contact angle of water on a superhydrophobic surface does not decrease significantly after the abrasion test. Thus, it is considered that the durability of this surface is good. Another test method is to conduct a cyclic freezing and deicing experiment on the surface. Experimental results showed that if the adhesion of the surface freezing is still less than 50 kPa after multiple cycles, the surface is considered to have good durability (Fig. 24(b)). Based on the poor durability of conformal hydrophobic coatings and the chemical functionalization of rough metal substrates, Yan et al.185 developed a completely different and unusual method to achieve a stable and self-controlled ultra-hydrophobic surface. Laser processing and thermal oxidation were used to create high-surface-energy copper oxide, followed by air-mediated adsorption of hydrophobic volatile organic compounds (VOC/non-polar hydroxyl/hydrocarbyl) on the surface. Copper was chosen as the substrate because of the strong adsorption of copper oxide, high contact angle and short adsorption saturation time. Experiments showed that stable superhydrophobicity could be achieved, and the condensed droplets on the surface of the copper oxide nanowires with sparse microfeatures had good mobility. Stable superhydrophobicity could be achieved after exposure to the laboratory environment for about 20 days. The investigation found that the surface adsorbs the hydroxyl groups in the air.

In the wide application of anti-icing coatings, the adhesion strength to the substrate and the stability of the ice-proof performance are the two main challenges. Thus, due to the special adhesion of polydimethylsiloxane polymer, it is widely used in the bonding of superhydrophobic coatings to substrates. Recently, Wang et al.188 reported a new type of micro–nano superhydrophobic coating prepared via a two-step method. Firstly, modified silicon nanoparticles were combined with PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)) to form a superhydrophobic coating with a circular network structure. In the second step, polydimethylsiloxane polymer and nitrocellulose were used as an intermediate layer to enhance the adhesion between the coating and the substrate. Simultaneously, some modified silicon nanoparticles were embedded in the PMMA pores to endow PMMA with superhydrophobicity and self-morphology. This structure dispersed the impact force to promote better abrasion resistance. After the sandpaper abrasion test and water sputtering test, the contact angle of the surface dropped from 168° to 143°, and the sliding angle slowly increased to about 10°, still maintaining good super hydrophobicity. Also, after standing for 12 h in the natural environment, the surface recovered to more than 160°, showing strong self-healing ability. The adverse effect of icing on infrastructure is a huge motivation to develop high-performance anti-icing materials. Jie et al.189 used polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and fluorinated polyhedral oligosiloxane (POSS) to co-crosslink. Using a self-adjusting honeycomb pattern, a low ice shear strength of 19.7 kPa was obtained. Because of its surface microstructure, the pattern could promote stress dispersion and the development of microcracks between the ice and the coating surface. The adhesion strength of the ice only slightly increased during the 30 deicing cycles.
Superhydrophobic surfaces are susceptible to friction and scratches from other metals in the natural environment. Thus, maintaining a certain degree of mechanical durability is essential to improving the long-lasting anti-icing ability of the surface.139 Pan et al.178 used an ultra-fast laser-chemical etching method to fabricate micro-cones with periodic structures on a copper surface, and increased the height of the micro-cones to improve the stability and mechanical durability of the Cassie state of the fabricated surface. After reaching the optimal micro-cone height, the surface could withstand 500 times of tape peeling cycles and various linear wear. This is because friction could only reach the top area, and the undamaged nanorods on the sidewalls still provided good surface roughness. Maintaining the mechanical durability of the surface is not only related to the structure itself, where the choice of material also has a certain impact.190 Xiang et al.191 used a micro–nano structured nickel coating as a rough template, and then deposited a chromium coating on the nickel coating to improve its mechanical properties. Even when worn for 100 cycles, it could effectively repel moisture and exhibit superior mechanical stability.
To maintain the stability of superhydrophobic ice-proof surface air layers, the solution and the substrate should have certain pores. Also, preventing chemical corrosion solutions from damaging the surface can effectively extend the durability of superhydrophobic surfaces. Shi et al.192 reported the preparation of a superhydrophobic copper surface via silver nitrate treatment and dodecyl mercaptan modification. The prepared hydrophobic layer was composed of nano-sheets and a nano-particle-like matrix, with a layered and rough morphology. Simultaneously, a long alkyl chain was successfully assembled on the rough surface, reducing the surface energy, which could prevent water and corrosive substances from contacting the copper plate and showed excellent durability. Similarly, a sheet structure can be used to maintain the stability of the air layer. Bai et al.186 synthesized a fluorine-based graphene oxide-diatomite/epoxy resin composite coating using a self-assembly method, which can be applied directly on any surface. The results showed that the graphene oxide flakes in the coating provided a stable air layer and isolated the direct contact between the liquid and the surface (Fig. 24(c)). This coating effectively inhibited the nucleation of ice. After 50 cycles of sandpaper grinding, the coating still maintained complete superhydrophobic and anti-icing properties. In contrast, Raiyan et al.193 developed various superhydrophobic surfaces with carbon nanotubes and low-surface coatings. The carbon nanotube column had a good topological structure, showed complete droplet bouncing, significant freezing delay, and considerable durability over several icing/de-icing cycles. The high porosity of the carbon nanotubes maintained a long air layer in the experiment and improved the durability of the surface.
The method of reducing the adhesion between ice and the substrate by injecting a lubricating oil into the micro–nano surface is receiving increasing attention. However, ensuring the stability of the oil film has become the focus. Zhang et al.165 achieved a highly transparent and strong coating by injecting lubricant into a tubular silica composite structure. The composite structure of the tubular material and the tapered hole had a great locking effect on the lubricating oil, thereby reducing the loss of lubricating oil in the ice cycle. Liu et al.194 designed a network surface structure with interconnected microchannels and cross-linked nanosheets. As a natural oil reservoir, lubricants can be securely locked and stored in the network to achieve an effective ice-proof performance. It is worth noting that after 30 heating/cooling cycles, the sliding angle was less than 9°, indicating that it has good surface stability (Fig. 25(a)). Different from the previous two methods, the stability of the oil film can also be ensured by continuously replenishing lubricating oil. Yan et al.187 reported a completely repairable surface with micro-structured paraffin as the supporting structure and silicone oil as the lubricant. The heat-sensitive paraffin frame could quickly switch between the solid support structure and the liquid solution according to the temperature, realizing rapid regeneration of the microstructure. However, it exhibited limited self-repair ability after suffering minor injury (Fig. 25(b)).

In addition, ultraviolet light has a certain decomposing effect on organic polymers, thus superhydrophobic polymer coatings will easily lose their ice-proof properties when exposed to sunlight. However, if the heat of solar energy can be used to melt the ice layer formed on the surface in time, it will also be helpful to maintain the durability of the superhydrophobic surface. Ma et al.195 designed and manufactured a photothermal and superhydrophobic film based on a hybrid nanostructure of titanium nitride and polytetrafluoroethylene. The photothermal effect was to effectively absorb light through the deposited titanium nitride nanorods and convert light energy into heat energy. The hydrophobicity of the film was maximized by depositing polytetrafluoroethylene with high porosity. The combination of photothermal conversion and superhydrophobicity gave the surface excellent anti-icing performance, which exhibited both a passive anti-icing performance and active deicing function (Fig. 25(c)).
6. Conclusions and perspectives
Thus far, the research on artificial superhydrophobic ice-proof surfaces is extensive. Various phenomena in nature are a great source of inspiration for scientists and engineers to solve problems in real life. Researchers have developed many constructive measures for passive anti-icing by assimilating inspiration from animals and plants. Compared with the traditional active deicing methodologies, passive ice-proof surfaces not only can prolong the freezing time of the surface, but also promote the bouncing of droplets and reduce the adhesion on the surface.
In this review, we first outlined the biological cold-resistant ice-proof materials and their advances (section 2), providing bionic guidance for the micro-topography preparation of surfaces. Afterwards, we introduced the recent developments in research on the fabrication of ice-proof surfaces, where a large number of artificial superhydrophobic ice-proof surfaces with micro-nanostructure arrays have been prepared through various physical, chemical and other methods (section 3). Subsequently, the recent in-depth studies on feasible ice-proof and icephobicity strategies were presented, including icing formation theories, delayed freezing time, droplet bouncing, and inhibition of ice adhesion (section 4). Finally, we present the current problems and challenges of ice-proof and ice-phobic technology (section 6).
At present, most of these passive ice-proof and ice-phobic methods have only been explored through laboratory testing. The passive ice-proof strategies for most bionic superhydrophobic surfaces are still unavailable for large-scale application, or the level of technical maturity is low. Enhancing the mechanical robustness and stability of bionic superhydrophobic surfaces and other types of ice repellent surfaces is unavoidable, in particular, a preliminary introduction was presented in section 5. The durability of these surfaces can be enhanced by reasonably combining the appropriate structural design and material selection.125 In addition, another challenge faced by superhydrophobic ice-proof surfaces is the adhesion of ice to solid surfaces. Studies have found that under the premise of hydrophobicity, the higher the surface roughness, the better the hydrophobic effect, but after an increase in roughness, the adhesion of ice formed at low temperatures to the surface greatly increases. Inspired by the lubricating fluid secreted by some soft animals and plants, scientists and engineers tried to inject lubricating oil into superhydrophobic ice-proof surfaces to reduce the adhesion of the surface. These surfaces have some self-healing and durability, which can fundamentally remove condensation from the surface. However, the release of the lubrication layers may pose a hazard to the environment.
Consequently, more future efforts should focus on the design and production of large-scale, low-cost, environmentally friendly, easy-to-prepare bionic superhydrophobic ice-proof surfaces. Although challenges such as durability, anticontamination, functioning at extremely low temperatures and harsh conditions need to be addressed, the development of cold-resistant ice-proof materials have a bright future. Moreover, polymers containing silicon or fluorinated silicon should be selected to reduce the amount of fluorine in the chemical composition of the surface. Finally, it is certainly difficult to establish this relationship given that approaches to realize surface icephobicity vary greatly and a wide variety of materials have been selected for surface fabrication.196 We believe that with the help of modern analytical instruments and surface observation equipment, we can further reveal the relationship among the composition, structure and characteristics of biological surfaces. Simultaneously, with the guidance of nature and the help of current advanced manufacturing technology, the preparation of bionic superhydrophobic ice-proof surfaces will have a promising prospect.
