    , Accepted 7th June 2023First published on 26th June 2023AbstractConverting CO2 to valuable chemicals through a variety of thermal, photo-, and electro-catalytic reaction processes will reduce the net CO2 emission and contribute positively to the “net-zero” goal. C1 and C2 products are important chemical feedstocks and can be produced from the effective catalytic conversion of CO2. The key to developing effective CO2 conversion catalysts is an understanding of CO2 interaction and the elementary bond-breaking and formation steps on the active catalysts. Over the past two decades, density functional theory-based approaches have enabled both mechanistic understanding and catalyst design for CO2 activation and conversion. In this article, we review our recent effort in understanding the mechanism of CO2 activation and conversion, focusing on the unique role of the metal/metal oxide interfaces in both thermal and electrochemical catalytic CO2 reduction. We showed that In2O3-based catalysts exhibited a uniquely high methanol selectivity while suppressing CO formation from the reverse water–gas shift reaction. We have also demonstrated that the metal/metal-oxide interfaces can be tuned by selecting an appropriate metal and metal oxide to optimize its activity and selectivity for both thermal- and electro-catalytic reduction of CO2. The oxophilicity of the metal in the metal oxide can be used as a qualitative measure for determining the selectivity towards CH3OH or CH4 in the electro-catalytic reduction of CO2. The studies demonstrated the impact of the density functional theory-based atomic-level approaches in unravelling the reaction mechanism and predicting highly efficient catalysts and catalytic systems.

1. Introduction
Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, mainly carbon dioxide, are causing climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), “the historical warming between 1850–1900 and the modern period of 2006–2015 was assessed as 0.87 °C” and will likely continue this trend as carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will continue to increase.1 Slowing down climate change requires the reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions. Ultimately, achieving net-zero emissions globally would have a big impact on future climate change.2 Although some greenhouse gases are still released at net-zero emissions, they are offset by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere and sequestering them permanently in soil, plants, and materials or recycling them in the production of commodity chemicals. A multiprong approach, involving carbon capture and storage as well as substituting fossil fuels with carbon-free fuels, is needed to reach the net-zero goal, and eventually achieve negative emission.
Converting CO2 to valuable chemicals through a variety of green thermal, photochemical, and electrochemical reaction processes will reduce net CO2 emission and contribute positively to the “net-zero” goal. Methanol, methane, and CO are all important chemical feedstocks and can be easily integrated into the existing infrastructure of distribution and utilization as a means of CO2 conversion and utilization. Consequently, direct CO2 hydrogenation via heterogeneous catalytic processes to methanol, methane and CO (reverse water–gas shift, RWGS) has been widely studied over the past few decades.3–10 In particular, major progress has been made in developing various catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH via heterogeneous catalysis, including metals, metal oxides, and intermetallic compounds, as recently reviewed by Jiang et al.10 Electro- and photocatalytic CO2 conversions are also active areas of research and development.11–21
CO2 is a linear tri-atomic molecule with two equivalent CO double bonds and lies at the bottom of the free energy ladder thermodynamically.22 The uphill CO2 conversion process involves activating and breaking the C–O bonds. Distorting the molecule from the linear to a bent configuration breaks the symmetry and makes transferring electron to its antibonding orbitals energetically favorable and, thereby, its reduction facile. The process can be facilitated by effective catalysts and efficient catalytic processes.
Designing effective catalysts and developing efficient catalytic processes for CO2 activation and reduction depend on our understanding of CO2 interaction with the active catalysts, the elementary bond-breaking and making steps, and the interplay between sites with different catalytic functionalities. Theory and simulation, particularly the first principles-based density functional theory (DFT) approaches, have played important roles in both providing mechanistic understanding and designing novel catalysts for CO2 activation and conversion. We reviewed the contribution of the DFT-based computational analysis to the understanding of CO2 activation and conversion mechanism about a decade ago.22 In this perspective, we focus on our recent efforts in understanding the role of metal/metal-oxide interfaces in heterogenous thermal and electrochemical CO2 reduction and conversion.23–39
2. Heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation and conversion of CO2
Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts, incorporating different promoters, have been successfully employed for industrial methanol synthesis from syngas. This success made Cu/ZnO-based catalysts natural choices for CO2-to-methanol conversion.40–43 Extensive endeavors have been dedicated to elucidating the active sites and enhancing the understanding of the underlying reaction mechanism.44–47
Indium oxide (In2O3) is an n-type semiconductor with a bandgap of Eg = 3.75 eV (direct) or 2.61 eV (indirect).48 Its distinctive optical transparency and electrical conductivity make it an excellent transparent conducting material for electronic devices, solar cells, and flat-panel displays. Furthermore, it exhibits a remarkable sensitivity to a wide range of gases, such as oxidizing gases (e.g., NO2, Cl2, and O3), reducing gases (e.g., H2, CO, and CH4), acidic (e.g., CO2), and basic (e.g., NH3) gases, which have attracted great attention as an active component in gas sensors. While there have been numerous studies focusing on the properties and synthesis of the In2O3 semiconductor, research on In2O3 for catalysis was relatively scarce a decade ago. About a decade ago, we predicted the high selectivity and stability of In2O3 for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol based on DFT study because (i) CO2 hydrogenation to methanol was favored over the RWGS reaction on the In2O3 catalysts; (ii) the catalytic cycle is facilitated by the oxygen vacancy generation from H2/CO reduction and replenishment by O atom from the CO bond activation.23,24 Our experimental studies showed that CO2 can be activated and converted selectively to methanol on In2O3.28 The subsequent report by Martin, et al. showed that nanosized cubic In2O3 particles and ZrO2-supported In2O3 catalysts exhibited 100% methanol selectivity for 1000 h under industrially relevant conditions for CO2-to-methanol.49 The superior selectivity and stability of the In2O3 catalysts quickly caught the attention of the catalysis community and stimulated extensive research and development of In2O3-based catalysts for efficient CO2 conversion. In the subsequent sections, we will emphasize our research endeavors and contributions in this field.
2.1. CO2 activation and conversion on group 13 metal oxide surfaces
Computational exploration of CO2 hydrogenation typically begins by investigating the adsorption and activation of CO2 and H2, which are considered the initial crucial steps. We have summarized the adsorption and activation energies of CO2, H2O, and H2 on oxide surfaces and metal/oxide interfaces in Table 1.

Ye, et al. studied the adsorption and activation of CO2 and H2 on a perfect In2O3(110) surface using periodic DFT calculations.23 It has been observed that CO2 undergoes chemical adsorption on the In2O3(110) surface, resulting in the formation of surface carbonate species. This adsorption process is exothermic by −1.25 eV. H2 tends to undergo heterolytic dissociation on the surface, leading to the generation of a surface hydroxyl from a proton binding to the surface O and a hydride binding to the In. The homolytic dissociation of H2 at surface O sites was found to be thermodynamically favourable, however, the migration of hydride from the In site to the neighbouring O site has a significant activation barrier of 1.32 eV, which is kinetically unfavourable. Water can adsorb on the surface in two ways: molecularly or dissociatively. Molecular adsorption involves the intact water molecule binding to the surface, while dissociative adsorption leads to the splitting of water into hydroxyl and proton. The adsorption energies for molecular and dissociative water adsorption are −0.83 eV and −1.19 eV, respectively.23
The adsorbed CO2 could potentially react with hydride to produce formate species (HCOO*) or with proton to produce carboxylate species (COOH*). The former is endothermic by +0.33 eV with an activation barrier of 0.65 eV, whereas the latter reaction is exothermic by −0.78 eV, as shown in Fig. 1. The formate species may be further hydrogenated to form methanol as the surface formate species has been considered as an intermediate in methanol formation. Even though the formation of COOH* is thermodynamically favourable, the subsequent reactions: (i) the deprotonation of COOH* is exothermic by −0.74 eV with a small barrier of 0.10 eV, resulting in the bicarbonate reformation and surface H2O formation; (ii) RWGS via the dissociation of COOH* (COOH* → CO* + OH*) is highly endothermic (+1.07 eV). This analysis is based on the fact that although CO2 protonation by a surface hydroxyl is facile, and the subsequent step to form CO and H2O is highly endothermic (+1.07 eV). Consequently, the RWGS reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) would be blocked. In the meantime, the disproportion of the bicarbonate species with a surface hydroxyl is both energetically favourable and kinetically feasible.

Since the steps leading to bicarbonates eventually return to CO2 and effectively do not consume CO2, the net contribution to CO2 conversion is primarily the hydrogenation pathway. These results indicate that hydrogenation of CO2 to formate species is favourable over protonation to the bicarbonate species on the In2O3 surface. These results are consistent with the experimental observations that the indium oxide-based catalyst has a high CO2 selectivity and H2O resistance.
The reduction of In2O3 occurs at relative low temperature (<200 °C) under reducing gases, such as H2 or CO. The CO2 hydrogenation reaction conditions (a mixture of CO2 and H2, at 200–350 °C) facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancy on In2O3 surfaces. Ye et al. studied the role of oxygen vacancy on the In2O3(110) surface for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.24 Six possible surface oxygen vacancies were identified and were numbered from Ov1 to Ov6 on the perfect In2O3(110). The calculated formation energies of oxygen vacancies reveal that the D1 surface with the vacancy Ov1 is most stable, whereas the D4 surface, with the vacancy Ov4, is the least stable. The presence of the Ov4 leads to a localized electron density at the neighbouring In atom, while the formation of the Ov1 does not significantly impact the electron density at the In atoms. Two routes for methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation were investigated on both the D1 and D4 surfaces. It was discovered that the least stable D4 surface exhibited a higher activity for CO2 activation and hydrogenation compared to the most stable D1 surface. On the D4 surface, when a CO2 molecule is adsorbed, one of the oxygen atoms occupies the Ov4 site. The hydrogenation of CO2 to HCOO on the D4 surface demonstrates to be thermodynamically and kinetically favourable, as illustrated in the potential energy profile of Fig. 2. Subsequent hydrogenation of HCOO involves the formation of the C–H bond and the cleavage of the C–O bond, resulting in the production of H2CO and a hydroxyl species. The hydrogenation of HCOO is slightly endothermic, with an activation barrier of 0.57 eV. However, the hydrogenation of H2CO to H3CO exhibits a higher barrier of 1.14 eV, indicating that this step serves as the rate-limiting step in the methanol synthesis on the oxygen defective In2O3(110) surface. The overall mechanism is schematically shown in Fig. 2, highlighting the role of oxygen vacancy that is responsible for the good activity toward CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, and high stability—the catalytic cycle is enabled by the formation and replenishment of the oxygen vacancy.

Al2O3 and Ga2O3 are metal oxides in the same group as In2O3, which have been extensively studied as supports or promoters in various catalytic reactions, including CO2 conversion. In particular, Al2O3 is a component of the commercial Cu/Zn/Al catalysts for methanol production from syngas and has been extensively characterized as a support. To gain a deeper understanding of the role of the support/promoter played in CO2 conversion and to elucidate the key factors influencing the selectivity and activity of catalysts, the Ge group has dedicated substantial efforts to the detailed characterization of CO2 interaction and activation on the surfaces of γ-Al2O3 and β-Ga2O3 using DFT calculations over several years leading to the study on In2O3.50,51
On the dry γ-Al2O3(100) and (110) surfaces, CO2 is adsorbed in a bidentate configuration across the O–Al bridge sites, forming a carbonate species.50 The adsorption of CO2 on dry γ-Al2O3(100) (−0.80 eV) is stronger than that on dry γ-Al2O3(110) (−0.43 eV). The molecular adsorption of water on both (100) (−0.62 eV) and (110) (−0.08 eV) are much weaker than CO2 adsorption. Water dissociation is thermodynamically favourable on both surfaces, resulting in partially hydroxylated surfaces. Water dissociation on the (100) surface has no barrier with respect to the gaseous water molecule, but the same process on the (100) surface has a barrier of 0.42 eV. Overall, γ-Al2O3(100) adsorbs CO2 and H2O much stronger than the (110) surface. The dissociation of H2O on (100) is kinetically comparable with that on (110), while the binding of proton and OH on γ-Al2O3(110) is much stronger than that on (100). This indicates the hydroxylated γ-Al2O3(100) surface is predominantly covered by H2O and OH, while the hydroxylated γ-Al2O3(100) surface is dominantly covered by OH. The carbonate species can be protonated by proton from a neighbouring hydroxyl group or H2O on the partially hydroxylated γ-Al2O3 surfaces, resulting in a bicarbonate species. The CO2 protonation on hydroxylated γ-Al2O3(100) is slightly more kinetically favourable but much more thermodynamically favourable than that on hydroxylated γ-Al2O3(110).
We also studied the effects of hydration and oxygen vacancies on CO2 adsorption on the β-Ga2O3(100) surface.51 Our results showed that the adsorption of CO2 on the perfect β-Ga2O3(100) surface, either dry or hydrated, can produce bidentate carbonate species. However, the positive adsorption energies of CO2 indicate that CO2 adsorption is endothermic, and therefore, thermodynamically unfavourable. Water adsorption on perfect β-Ga2O3(100) is thermodynamically favourable (−0.56 eV), resulting in the hydrated surfaces. However, we found the hydrated surface can weaken the CO2 adsorption, indicated by more endothermic CO2 adsorption on the hydrated surface. In the presence of co-adsorbed H2O, the bidentate carbonate species could be protonated to form the bicarbonate species. The formation of the bicarbonate species causes the overall process to be slightly thermodynamically favourable. The presence of oxygen vacancy promotes the adsorption and activation of CO2. In the most stable CO2 adsorption configuration on the dry defective β-Ga2O3(100) surface with an oxygen vacancy, one of the oxygen atoms of the adsorbed CO2 occupies the oxygen vacancy site, and the CO2 adsorption energy is −0.31 eV. Water favours dissociative adsorption at the oxygen vacancy site on the defective surface. This process is kinetically favourable with a barrier of 0.17 eV and a reaction energy of −0.62 eV. These results indicate that, when water and CO2 are present in the adsorption system simultaneously, water will compete with CO2 for the oxygen vacancy sites and negatively impact CO2 adsorption and conversion.
2.2. CO2 activation and conversion at the metal/oxide and oxide/oxide interfaces
Having demonstrated great selectivity and stability of In2O3 for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, we expanded our studies to methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation on a model catalyst Pd4/In2O3 using both DFT and microkinetic modelling.26 We have investigated three potential pathways for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. From our DFT results, we have determined that the HCOO route and the RWGS route are competitive, while the HCOOH route is kinetically impeded due to a high activation barrier. The rate limiting steps in the HCOO and RWGS routes are H2COO* + H* ↔ H2CO* +OH* and cis-COOH* + H* ↔ CO* + H2O*, respectively. The results from microkinetic modelling clearly indicate that the HCOO route emerges as the predominant pathway for the production of methanol through CO2 hydrogenation. Furthermore, the activation of the H adatom on the Pd cluster and the presence of H2O on the In2O3 substrate play important roles in promoting methanol production as shown in Fig. 3. Hydroxyl adsorption at the interface of Pd4/In2O3 triggers structural transformation of the supported Pd4 cluster, transitioning it from a butterfly-shaped configuration to a tetrahedral one. This structural reconstruction not only signifies the dynamic behaviour of the supported nanoparticle throughout the reaction but also leads to a consequential alteration in the final hydrogenation step, shifting from CH3O to H2COH. This observation highlights the influence of hydroxyl adsorption on the structural dynamics and reaction pathways of the supported Pd4 cluster.

Built upon our understanding of CO2 adsorption and activation on both dry and hydroxylated γ-Al2O3 surfaces, we have compared the activity and selectivity of Ni4 supported on dry γ-Al2O3(Ni4/D-γ-Al2O3) and hydroxylated γ-Al2O3(Ni4/H-γ-Al2O3) catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to formate and CO.52 On Ni4/D-γ-Al2O3, the reaction energy and activation barrier with respect to the co-adsorbed CO2 and H for formate formation are −0.23 eV and 1.25 eV, respectively, whereas those for CO formation are −0.48 eV and 2.13 eV, respectively. The formate formation is preferred kinetically while CO formation is more facile thermodynamically on Ni4/D-γ-Al2O3. On Ni4/H-γ-Al2O3, the reaction energy and activation barrier for formate formation become −0.36 eV and 2.32 eV, respectively, whereas those for CO formation are −0.67 eV and 0.69 eV, respectively. As such, CO formation becomes more favourable both kinetically and thermodynamically. These results are schematically summarized in Fig. 4. The findings demonstrate that the hydroxylation of γ-Al2O3 modifies the CO2 hydrogenation pathway on Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. This alteration in the reaction pathway has significant implications for the distribution of the resulting products and, consequently, the selectivity of the reaction. These analyses have broader applicability to heterogeneous catalytic reactions, providing valuable insights for selecting suitable supports based on the specific reaction environment. These insights can aid in optimizing catalytic performance and guiding the design of catalyst-support systems for various catalytic processes.

We also studied the activity and selectivity of the bimetallic Cu–Co cluster supported on γ-Al2O3 for CO production (CO2 + H → CO + OH) and formate formation (CO2 + H → HCOO).53 We found that the adsorbed CO2 on Co3Cu is less activated than that on Co4. For the reactions occurring on the bimetallic cluster, the introduction of Cu effectively lowers the activation barrier by 0.36 eV for HCOO formation compared to that on Co4, but the barrier for CO formation is almost unchanged. We found that the active involvement of surface hydroxyls on γ-Al2O3 in the elementary reactions taking place at the metal-support interface. At the interface, the adsorbed CO2 can readily undergo protonation by the hydroxyl groups present on the support. The molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories provided compelling evidence that the protonated CO2 species at the Co4/oxide interface undergoes rapid dissociation at 300 K, resulting in the formation of CO and OH. Furthermore, at 500 K, the OH species selectively reacts with a surface hydroxyl group, leading to the disproportionate generation of H2O. At the interfacial sites of the Co–Cu supported catalyst, our investigation revealed the adsorbed COOH species were the primary product. This study effectively demonstrates the pronounced impact of the bimetallic effect on both catalytic activity and selectivity by altering the reaction pathways and consequently leading to a different distribution of final products.
For Pd/In2O3 catalysts, H2 dissociation on the Pd cluster is much more favourable than CO2 adsorption on the Pd cluster, suggesting the possibility of high H coverage on the Pd cluster.25 Consequently, the dissociative adsorption of H2 prevails on the Pd cluster, pushing CO2 to adsorb at the interfacial sites. Therefore, the Pd/In2O3 interfacial sites assist the migration of H to CO2. For the Ni/D-γ-Al2O3 catalyst, CO2 and H both adsorb at the Ni4 cluster, where the hydride (Ni-H) transfer to CO2 is energetically unfavourable because hydride prefers the hydrogenation reaction,52 and therefore CO production is less likely to occur because it is produced via the dissociation of carboxylate species (COOH) which resulted from CO2 protonation, as shown in Table 1. Because the interface between Ni4 cluster and hydroxylated γ-Al2O3 assists the migration of proton on the γ-Al2O3 surface to adsorbed CO2 on the Ni cluster, therefore, CO formation is favourable on the hydroxylated γ-Al2O3 supported Ni catalyst. Similar behaviours of interfacial sites and OH were observed on the Cu–Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.
Metal oxide and oxide catalysts are commonly designed to provide multiple functional sites for simultaneous conversion of CH4 and CO2 to high-value products. ZnO, ZrO2, and Ga2O3 are widely used as either a support or promoter for CO2 conversion. We have created the oxide-on-oxide interfacial sites between the substrate (In2O3) and dispersed oxides [(ZnO)3, (ZrO2)3, or Ga2O3] to study the effect of interfacial sites on the activation and conversion of CO2 and CH4.54 In contrast to the Eley–Rideal mechanism observed for the C–C coupling of CO2 and CH3 on Zn-doped ceria,33 our findings indicate that the formation of a Zn–C–C–O transition state at the active centres arises from a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism. This mechanism involves the activated CO2 species, which not only facilitates the C–C coupling but also enhances the dissociative adsorption of CH4, as shown in Fig. 5. Microkinetic analysis reveals that the direct C–C coupling process is primarily driven by the dissociative adsorption of CH4, which plays a dominant role. On the other hand, the adsorption and activation of CO2 have a relatively minor impact on the overall reaction. DFT calculation results reveal that the C–C coupling step is the kinetically most relevant step for the conversion of CH4 and CO2 to acetic acid on the (ZnO)3/In2O3 catalyst surface. (ZnO)3/In2O3(110) exhibits higher activity for acetic acid formation than the Ga2O3/In2O3 and (ZrO2)3/In2O3 catalysts. This study offers valuable mechanistic insights into the direct C–C coupling of CH4 and CO2, which can be leveraged to design more efficient catalysts in the future.

3. Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 at the metal/oxide interfaces
The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 involves a complicated multiple proton–electron transfer process and can be achieved through both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts.11,13,15,55–59 Several multielectron reduction products have been identified on different catalysts. The standard thermodynamic redox potentials with reference to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) for selected C1 products at pH = 7, 25 °C, 1 atm of gases (g), 1 M solutes (aq), and water as a solvent (l) are listed below:60CO2(g) + e− → CO2−(aq) E = −1.99 VCO2(g) + 2H+(aq) + 2e− → CO(g) + H2O(l) E = −0.52 VCO2(g) + 2H+(aq) + 2e− → HCOOH(aq) E = −0.61 VCO2(g) + 6H+(aq) + 6e− → CH3OH(aq) + H2O(l) E = −0.38 VCO2(g) + 8H+(aq) + 8e− → CH4(g) + 2H2O(l) E = −0.24 V
Although the formation reactions of CH3OH and CH4 are endergonic, the potentials for these multielectron CO2 reductions are relatively low. On the other hand, both are generally minor products on most electrodes since the one-electron reduction of CO2 to CO2− is believed to be the potential-limiting step.11 The formation of the multielectron products depends on the efficiency of CO2− formation as well as subsequent proton coupled electron transfer to CO2− under the reaction conditions.
Recognizing the intrinsic activity of metal/metal-oxide interfaces toward CO2 adsorption and activation from our studies highlighted above, we constructed model catalysts with similar metal/metal-oxide interfaces and examined their activity in the context of electrocatalytic reduction of CO2.
Possible reaction pathways for electrochemical reduction from adsorbed CO2 to CO(g), CH2O(l), HCOOH(l), CH3OH(l) and CH4(g) are presented in Scheme 1.39 Note that the adsorbed states were also shown with “*” either on the left or the right of the species, depending on publications. Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET, i.e., H+ + e−) to C and O are referred to as hydrogenation and protonation, respectively. Reduction of *CO2 proceeds through either hydrogenation to *HCOO or protonation to *COOH. Further protonation of *HCOO produces *HCOOH, which may desorb as HCOOH(l) or undergo further reduction if it is stable on the surface. However, protonation of *COOH leads to *CO by eliminating OH in the form of water. The *CO species may diffuse to metal sites of the electrode and be further hydrogenated by following the extensively studied routes.61,62 H2CO(l), a product of a sequential four-electron reduction process, could form from *HCOOH via. If *H2CO remains on the surface, CH3OH(l) may be produced through two different pathways: (i) , or (ii) . Methanol can also be formed from . If *H3COH is more stable than its desorbed form of CH3OH(l), it can be further reduced to CH4(g). CH4(g) can also be formed through the *H2C intermediate instead of *H3COH, i.e., either (i)  or (ii) , depending on the relative stability of the hydrogenation intermediates.

The free energy diagrams for CO2 reduction along different pathways were calculated based on the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model developed by Nørskov et al.45 According to the CHE model, the proton-coupled electron transfer step has a negligible kinetic barrier at room temperature. Consequently, the step with the most positive free energy difference is potential-limiting, and likely rate-determining.11 In practice, the free energy, G, of each intermediate can be determined by the following equation, G = Eelec + ZPE – TS,(1)using the DFT calculated electronic energy, Eelec. The zero-point energy, ZPE, and vibrational contribution to the entropy of the adsorbed species can be obtained using the calculated vibrational frequencies.46 The chemical potential of a proton–electron pair (μ[H+ + e−]) at U = 0 V equals half of hydrogen (0.5 μ[H2]) at 1 atom of H2, 298 K, and all pH values. Thus, the free energy change of each elementary step at an applied potential U will be shifted by |e|U as ΔG (U) = ΔG (U = 0) + |e|U(2)where |e| is the electronic charge. According to Nørskov et al., the thermodynamic barrier equals the largest of the free energy differences.45
3.1. SnOx/Sn
We have selected the SnOx/Sn interface to examine electrochemical reduction of CO2.32 Tin-based electrodes have been widely studied experimentally for CO2 reduction due to their high overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).63 Formic acid, or formate in basic solutions, was reported as the dominant product with a wide range of faradaic efficiencies.64–67 The SnOx/Sn interface was modelled in the form of a SnO monolayer on the Sn(112) surface. Water molecules were treated explicitly and were considered to actively participate in the reaction in the study. With one coupled proton–electron transfer, the hydrogen adatom may be formed on the surface Sn site as a surface hydride. A water molecule can dissociate into a surface hydroxyl group on a Sn site and a proton on a surface oxygen atom, resulting in two symmetric OH* species. A surface hydroxyl may also form as a result of proton transfer from the solution to the surface oxygen site. The reaction free energies of forming surface hydride (on the Sn site) and hydroxyls are plotted as a function of potentials in Fig. 6(a). Clearly, at negative potentials relevant to CO2 reduction, hydroxyls formed from H2O dissociation and hydride species are the favorable hydrogen species. Under a reducing potential, proton coupled electron transfer to the surface hydroxyls may create oxygen vacancies in the oxide layer. The surface hydrogen species may react with CO2 to form either the COOH* or HCOO* species. The free energies of forming oxygen vacancy (VO), *COOH and HCOO* species are shown in Fig. 6(b).

Fig. 7 shows the lowest free energy pathway and the corresponding configurations for CO2 reduction on the surface with symmetric OH* to form formate and carbon monoxide. The CO2 molecule approaches one of the OH* species and inserts itself into the O–Sn bond. Simultaneously, the proton will transfer from the bottom oxygen atom to the top oxygen atom to form a bicarbonate-like (HCO3(t)*) intermediate. The possibility of forming the HCO3(b)* intermediate by keeping a proton on the bottom oxygen atom that binds the tin atom has been ruled out. The subsequent reduction of CO2 begins by hydrogenating the HCO3(t)* intermediate. Hydrogenating the C atom coupled with C–O bond breakage leads to the formate species (HCOO*) whereas transferring a proton to the bottom O atom coupled with C–O bond breakage results in the carboxyl (COOH*) intermediate. The formation of HCOO* has a relatively lower energy of −0.20 eV than the formation of COOH*. These results demonstrate that the potential-limiting step along this pathway is COOH* formation. A reaction free energy of 0.20 eV corresponds to a potential of −0.20 V (RHE). Further reduction of COOH* at the O atom produces CO and H2O.

Compared with CO2 reduction on pristine Sn(112), the presence of SnOx enhances the reactivity by lowering the overpotential and changing product distribution. From the thermodynamic consideration, HCOO* formation is more favourable than COOH*, resulting in a higher formic acid selectivity than carbon monoxide. The result is consistent with the experimental observations that formate was the main product whereas carbon monoxide can be produced with a lower faradaic efficiency for CO2 electrochemical reduction on SnOx/Sn electrodes.64–67 On the other hand, the formation of SnOx on the Sn electrode opened new reaction channels to other products, including CO. In contrast, COOH* was unlikely to form on the Sn(112) surface and the minor CO product was likely formed through the HCOO* intermediate.31 It has been shown that the formation of CO only accounts for a small fraction of the faradaic efficiency (∼10%) for CO2 electrochemical reduction on the Sn electrodes.64,68 This was attributed to the fact that the HCOO* can be easily reduced and desorbed from the surface, reducing the possibility of further reduction to CO.
Desorption of HCOO− and CO desorption from the surface will recover the hydroxylated surface and complete the reaction cycle. Therefore, the dominant mechanism for CO2 reduction on the SnO/Sn(112) surface is very likely to proceed through the bicarbonate (HCO3(t)*) species on the hydroxylated surface. The HCO3(t)* species would be the key intermediate to forming HCOO* and CO, and the formation of COOH* from HCO3(t)* would be the potential-limiting step.67 Although H2 may be produced by protonation of the H* adatom, the surface OH* species is thermodynamically more stable under the typical electrode potentials. Consequently, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was suppressed.
3.2. TiO2/Ag(110)
As we demonstrated in the study of electrochemical reduction of CO2 at the SnO/Sn interface, the presence of the metal oxide/metal interface may change the reaction mechanism, thereby affecting the reactivity and selectivity of the reaction. We expanded the study to TiO2/Ag(110) based on the hypothesis that the oxophilicity of the metal in the metal oxide would dictate the activity for C–O bond activation and overall CO2 conversion.34
(TiO2)3/Ag(110) has been constructed as the interfacial model for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. The results show that the interfacial sites are active for CO2 adsorption and activation and facilitate further reduction. At the (TiO2)3/Ag(110) interface, Ag acts as an electron-donor and channels the electron to reduce proton to hydrogen, which then hydrogenates CO2. The interface also enables efficient CO2 reduction by facilitating direct electron transfer to CO2 and opens new reaction channels not available on pure metal electrodes. As shown in Fig. 8, the HCOO* pathway is the thermodynamically dominating pathway, with H2COOH* being the key intermediate. Further hydrogenation of H2COOH* breaks one of the C–O bonds, resulting in CH3OH and O* or CH3O* and OH*, respectively. The (TiO2)3/Ag(110) catalyst also enables hydrogenation of COOH* to HCOOH* whereas protonation to CO* + H2O is energetically unfavourable. HCOOH* formation and its further hydrogenation to H2COOH* merges the COOH* pathway with the HCOO* pathway. Following this pathway, formation of CH3OH competes with CH4 as the product of the reduction following the formation of CH3O*. Therefore, the dominating pathway on the (TiO2)3/Ag(110) catalyst leading to CH3OH is through H2COOH*. The formation of H2COOH* from HCOO* is the potential-limiting step (0.47 eV). Further conversion to CH4 through protonating H2COOH* and hydrogenating CH3O* are spontaneous under an applied potential of −0.47 V.

Several studies have shown that CH3O* is the key intermediate and determines the selectivity between CH4 and CH3OH, depending on the oxophilicity of the catalytically active sites.69–72 In fact, O binding energy has been used as a descriptor for selectivity between CH3OH and CH4 on metal and metal oxide-based electrocatalysts, and CH4 would be the preferred product on the catalysts exhibiting stronger binding toward O.71,73–75 Bhowmik and co-workers reported that the CH3O* intermediate formed on Ti-doped RuO2 prefers to be hydrogenated to CH4 and leaves O* on the surface due to the strong binding ability of Ti toward O.74 On (TiO2)3/Ag(110), the Ti site binds the O end of the CH3O* species with its methyl group (–CH3) pointing away from the metal surface. Hydrogenating the C position of CH3O* results in breaking the C–O bond and forming CH4. The high free energy barrier of 1.33 eV to protonate CH3O* to CH3OH makes C–O bond breaking and CH4 formation favourable. Consequently, the formation of CH3O* on (TiO2)3/Ag(110) is likely to result in CH4.
To sustain the catalytic cycle, the O* species must be cleared through consecutive protonation steps and desorption as H2O. With a free energy barrier of 1.00 eV, our result indicates that hydrogenation of OH* to H2O is highly endergonic, making the OH* removal the potential-limiting step. Therefore, a catalyst such as (TiO2)3/Ag(110) may have to be regenerated/activated to maintain the reactivity and selectivity in practice. To overcome this limitation, metals with a moderate oxygen affinity can be used as they are expected to favour methanol over methane following CH3O* formation while facilitating more efficient OH* removal.
3.3. FeO/Cu(100), CoO/Cu(100) and NiO/Cu(100)
Group 8–10 3d metals, including Fe, Co, and Ni, have a weaker oxophilicity than Ti and may provide a balanced C–O activation activity and oxygen affinity. Therefore, we have constructed interfacial models based on oxides of these metals and selected Cu(100) as the electrode metal39 and anticipated that the interface would lower the limiting potential and enhance the product selectivity for electrochemical CO2 reduction from those on copper. In fact, heterostructured Cu/oxide electrodes with appropriate oxides have been shown to offer unique interfacial boundaries for the CO2 reduction reactions.76–78 The interfacial sites modulate the adsorption of intermediates and energy barriers of key reaction steps, resulting in enhanced conversion of CO2 into multicarbon products.

3.3.1. CHE model. 

Fig. 9 shows the free energy profiles of the most favourable routes on all three catalysts at an external potential U = −0.48 V. This potential was selected based on the thermodynamic barrier (0.48 eV) on (CoO)4/Cu(100), which is the greatest among the three catalysts. Under this potential, CO2 would be reduced to CH4(g) on (FeO)4/Cu(100) and (CoO)4/Cu(100), and to CH3OH(l) on (NiO)4/Cu(100).

Strong binding of *O containing species may poison the catalyst.34,74,79 This has been demonstrated in our study on the TiO2/Ag(110) catalysts. In the case of FeO, CoO and NiO, weak adsorption of *OH species is expected to benefit the catalytic turnover. Fig. 9 shows that protonation of the *OH species to form water is exergonic on (CoO)4/Cu(100) by −0.76 eV and (NiO)4/Cu(100) by −0.32 eV at an applied potential of −0.48 eV and would not poison the catalysts.
The stability of these supported oxides has been tested by determining the limiting potential corresponding to that of oxygen vacancy formation, an indicator of their reduction. Our results show that the limiting potentials for oxygen vacancy formation are −0.98 V, −0.62 V and −0.57 V on (FeO)4/Cu(100), (CoO)4/Cu(100) and (NiO)4/Cu(100). These potentials are more negative than the respective CO2 reduction limiting potentials, indicating these oxides would be stable under the respective CO2 reduction potentials.
The stability of *H3COH on the surface plays a pivotal role in determining the selectivity between CH3OH(l) and CH4(g). A stable *H3COH species will enable its further reduction to CH4(g). If *H3COH can desorb from the surface as CH3OH(l), methanol will be the dominant product. Since the reaction environment, such as the type of solvents, may affect the relative stability of the reaction intermediates, we examined the solvent effect by using the implicit solvation model implemented in VASP.80,81 Our results showed that including the solvation effect stabilized *H3COH species on (CoO)4/Cu(100) more significantly than that on (FeO)4/Cu(100) and (NiO)4/Cu(100). We further evaluated the solvation effect on the following reduction steps, i.e.,  on (CoO)4/Cu(100) and (NiO)4/Cu(100) and  on (FeO)4/Cu(100). Solvation contributions to the reaction free energies are −0.18 eV, −0.72 eV and −0.13 eV on (FeO)4/Cu(100), (CoO)4/Cu(100) and (NiO)4/Cu(100), respectively, which indicates that the solvation effect is more pronounced on the (CoO)4/Cu(100) catalyst. Detailed analysis revealed that the *H3COH species was stabilized by ∼0.82 eV on (CoO)4/Cu(100) when the solvation effect was included.
To quantify the effect of solvents on the stability of *CH3OH, we systematically varied the relative permittivity constants (εr), with εr = 7.6, 32.7, 35.9, 46.5 and 66.1. These values correspond to common solvents like tetrahydrofuran (THF), methanol, AN, DMSO and PC, respectively. To determine the relative stability between *CH3OH and CH3OH(l), free energy of formation of *H3COH from CO2(g) on (CoO)4/Cu(100) was plotted as a function of εr in Fig. 10. The horizontal line drawn at −0.09 eV refers to the standard reaction free energy for the reduction of CO2(g) to CH3OH(l), i.e., CO2(g) + 6(H+ + e−) → CH3OH(l) + H2O(l).

In the region above the line, *H3COH is less stable than CH3OH(l) and will desorb as CH3OH(l), indicating methanol will be selectively produced. In the region below the line, *H3COH is thermodynamically stable on the surface and can undergo further reduction to CH4(g). The black dots in Fig. 10 indicate that CH3OH(l) is favourable on (CoO)4/Cu(100) in the THF, AN, DMSO, methanol and PC solvents. On the other hand, the reaction free energy of  can also be affected by solvent. The reaction free energies of this step in THF, methanol, AN, DMSO and PC are 0.71 eV, 0.57 eV, 0.55 eV, 0.53 eV and 0.48 eV, respectively. These results indicate that at an applied potential of −0.48 V, PC is the best solvent to selectively produce CH3OH(l). Other solvents may exhibit CH3OH(l) selectivity at more negative potentials.


3.3.2. ECP vs. CHE. 
We note that the CHE and limiting potential approach assumes that the linear free energy relationship is valid for the reactions82–84 and the concerted proton–electron transfer (H+ + e−) to the adsorbed species is in equilibrium under the corresponding applied potential whereas other factors that may contribute to the reaction have been neglected.85,86 On the other hand, complex multistep proton–electron transfer steps involved in electrochemical CO2 reduction may not satisfy all the assumptions implied in the CHE approach, especially when the overall reaction involves non-redox steps that break or make the C–O and C–C bonds. In this scenario, additional considerations beyond CHE are needed to account for the potential-dependent non-redox steps. The constant electrode potential (CEP) model is another model available for computational electrochemistry studies.62,87–96 In the CEP model, the constant electrode potential (U) was achieved by varying the number of electrons to adjust the Fermi level of the system. The relationship between applied potential, U, and Fermi level, Ef, with reference to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is expressed as U = (−Ef − ΦSHE)/|e|, with ΦSHE being the work function of the standard Pt electrode. We adopted ΦSHE = 4.43 eV based on previous studies of CO2ER and OER.62,97,98
To determine the exact limiting potential, we constructed free energy profiles for the first three steps: CO2(g) → *CO2 → *COOH → *HCOOH on (FeO)4/Cu(100), (CoO)4/Cu(100) and (NiO)4/Cu(100) in Fig. 11a–c at U = 0 V, −0.25 V, −0.48 V, −0.71 V and −1.0 V using the CEP model.99 The value of U = −0.71 V was chosen based on the projected limiting potential on (FeO)4/Cu(100) determined at U = −0.48 V. Other U values were chosen to sample a sufficient range. Fig. 11a shows that the potential limiting step (PLS) is *CO2 → *COOH on (FeO)4/Cu(100). Fig. 11b and c show that PLS is *COOH → *HCOOH on (CoO)4/Cu(100) and (NiO)4/Cu(100). In order to determine the exact limiting potential, we plotted the reaction free energy of PLS as a function of applied potential (U) in Fig. 11d–f on (FeO)4/Cu(100), (CoO)4/Cu(100) and (NiO)4/Cu(100). The trendline for each PLS versus U provides linear equations of y = 0.74x + 0.65, R2 = 0.98 on (FeO)4/Cu(100) (Fig. 11d), y = 1.06x + 0.84, R2 = 0.99 on (CoO)4/Cu(100) (Fig. 11e) and y = 0.87x + 0.61, R2 = 0.99 on (NiO)4/Cu(100) (Fig. 11f). Based on those linear trendlines, we obtained limiting potentials of −0.88 V, −0.80 V and −0.70 V on (FeO)4/Cu(100), (CoO)4/Cu(100) and (NiO)4/Cu(100), respectively. These limiting potentials are significantly more negative than the corresponding values determined based on the CHE model.

In addition to the difference in the predicted limiting potentials between the CHE and CEP models, the predicted product selectivity can also be different. For example, the CHE model predicted that CH3OH(l) was not stable on (FeO)4/Cu(100) and (CoO)4/Cu(100) whereas the CEP model showed that CH3OH(l) would be produced on both (FeO)4/Cu(100) and (CoO)4/Cu(100). On (NiO)4/Cu(100), the CHE model predicts a selective production of CH3OH(l) whereas the CEP model predicts a selectivity toward CH4(g).

3.4. Beyond C1 product
Reducing CO2 to high value products beyond C1 compounds such as ethanol and ethene is highly desirable but faces many challenges. The oxide-derived Cu catalysts have been shown to reduce CO2 to C2 and higher-order hydrocarbons and alcohols.100–102
A slab model based on Cu32O8 derived from the reduction of Cu2O103 was constructed as a catalyst for CO2 reduction to ethanol via the CO intermediate.36 The model was based on the fact that the presence of the Cu+ sites on the oxide surface facilitated the adsorption and stabilization of *CO, as well as its further hydrogenation to *CHO.
We compared the reaction free energies of forming *OCCO, *OCCOH and *OCCHO in Fig. 12a. Although *CO and *COH coupling is exergonic, the much higher reaction free energy of forming *COH makes this pathway less likely be the route to forming the C2 intermediate. Furthermore, the formation of an *OCCO intermediate from direct *CO dimerization needs to overcome a relatively high reaction free energy of 1.23 eV, consistent with other studies on the copper catalysts.104 In contrast, the reaction free energy for the coupling reaction between *CO and *CHO is endergonic by only 0.05 eV. Additionally, the activation barrier of hydrogenating *CO to *CHO (0.79 eV) is much lower than the reaction free energy of CO dimerization (1.23 eV). Overall, the formation of *OCCHO via the C–C coupling between the hydrogenated intermediate *CHO and *CO is more favorable. Furthermore, the transition state for the coupling reaction between *CO and *CHO shown in Fig. 12b corresponds to an activation energy barrier of 0.58 eV, indicating that the reaction is accessible/possible at room temperature. Consequently, the formation of the *CHO intermediate is the potential limiting step for producing *OCCHO. Further reduction steps following *OCCHO formation are downhill all the way to ethanol. The oxygen-bound intermediate *OCHCH2 may divide the pathway to ethanol and ethylene. The low coordinated Cu+ site maintains the C–O bond of *OCHCH2 and stabilizes the *OCHCH3 intermediate. The Cu+/Cu0 surface sites result in a weak *O binding and are not active for a deoxygenation product such as ethylene. These results indicate that ethanol selectivity can be enhanced by tuning the degree of oxidation of the Cu surface.

4. Conclusions and outlooks
The dramatic improvement in the capability of the computational software packages and CPU/GPU power have made tracking the complex reaction mechanism a reality for moderately complex systems. Computational studies have successfully predicted trends of activity and selectivity, pinned down active cites/complexes, helped to rationalize the experimental observation/data and predicted new materials and reaction conditions. As we demonstrated through our studies highlighted here, the metal/metal-oxide interfaces can be tuned by selecting an appropriate metal and metal oxide to optimize its activity and selectivity for both the thermal and electro catalytic reduction of CO2 to C1 and C2 products. The oxophilicity of the metal in the metal oxide can be used as a qualitative measure for determining the selectivity towards CH3OH or CH4. On the other hand, a quantitative determination of the conversion and selectivity requires extensive knowledge of kinetics as well as mass transport involved in chemical transformation.10
Among the systems we studied, In2O3-based catalysts exhibit a uniquely high methanol selectivity while suppressing CO formation from RWGS.105 Combining In2O3 with a transition metal increases the availability of atomic hydrogen and facilitates the activation of CO2.26 The unique properties of In2O3 continue to stimulate interests in exploiting the application of In2O3 in thermal, electro- and photo-catalytic CO2 conversion.46,106–117 Combining catalytic functionalities of different metals and/or oxides can be exploited in design novel catalysts with greatly improved activity and selectivity. Modelling in combination with detailed analysis is essential to optimize the catalyst design and materials preparation.
The metal/metal-oxide interface has been extensively studied for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to C1 and C2 products.21,118 Although progress has been made, there are significant challenges, including overall efficiency and long-term stability. Modeling electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 under a realistic reaction environment remains a challenge. As we illustrated in our study, the electrode potential will affect the stability of the reaction intermediates along the reaction pathway. In addition, the effect of the applied potential on the non-redox steps has not been widely investigated. However, this issue is critical to the formation of C2 and other long chain products. Furthermore, the heterogeneous nature of the interface would modify the local electrical field, impacting the bond-breaking and making steps under such local fields. Non-aqueous solvent will not only modify the dielectric field in which the reactions take place but also affect the reaction by limiting the availability of the protons. Combining the electrochemical and non-electrochemical steps in a unified kinetics model remains a great challenge. In fact, modeling the kinetics of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is in its infancy119–124 and there are great opportunities to develop unified models for the complex electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.
