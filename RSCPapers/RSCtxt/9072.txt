    , Accepted 13th July 2018First published on 16th July 2018AbstractUsing 4-[5-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-4H-[1,2,4]triazol-3-yl]-pyridine (L1) and 2-(3-carboxypyridin-2-yl) nicotinic acid (H2L2), two coordination polymers (CPs) formulated as [Cu(HL1)2(Mo8O26)]·5H2O (1) and [{Cu4(L2)4(H2O)6}(H3PMo12O40)]·7H2O (2) were hydrothermally synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The two CPs exhibit a 2D architecture, but strong interlayer π–π stacking interactions are only observed in the structure of CP 1. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and DFT calculations reveal that CP 1 is a semiconductor with a narrow band gap of 1.22 eV, and it showed a photocurrent response under visible light illumination (λ > 420 nm, 100 mW cm−2). Based on CP 1, a device FTO/CP 1/RuO2 was constructed, which showed a much enhanced photoresponse with a much larger specific capacity (120.7 C g−1) than the individual CP 1 (<1 C g−1) and RuO2 (10.5 C g−1) when irradiated by visible light in the presence of methanol. It was due to the matched energy levels between the components in the device and the oxidation potential of methanol in the electrolyte solution, leading to efficient separation of the photoinduced electrons and holes to give an improved photovoltaic effect. As for the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device, its specific capacity (120.7 C g−1) obtained by the visible light illumination in the presence of methanol was much larger than that (11.5 C g−1) obtained in the dark without methanol, further suggesting the transformation among solar energy, chemical energy and electric energy.
Introduction
With the depletion of fossil fuels, renewable and clean energy sources and technologies associated with energy conversion and storage have aroused people's interest. Solar energy has been considered the preferable substitute for fossil sources, due to its advantage of being abundant and inexpensive.1 However, the bottleneck in efficiently using solar energy is the intermittent nature of solar irradiation, which has significant impact on the reliability and stability of the electric grid.2 In recent years, supercapacitors have attracted significant attention due to their faster and higher power capability and long life compared with batteries.3–5 If solar energy and supercapacitors could be combined, the utilization efficiency of the intermittent renewable energy source may be improved.
Recently, coordination polymers (CPs) have shown attractive topological structures and properties, which endow them with wide potential applications in catalysis, optics, gas storage, etc.6–9 Our previous work focused on the semiconducting characteristics of CPs.10–13 Meanwhile, polyoxometalates (POMs), as a large family of anionic metal oxide clusters of d-block transitional metals, have reversible multiple-redox properties and thermodynamic stability, making them optimal building units.14–18 If a POM is incorporated into a CP, it is estimated that the POM-based CP possesses excellent electrochemical activity and photoactive behaviors due to the redox behavior and semiconducting feature of the POM and CP constituents. Actually, POM-CPs have shown a variety of potential applications,19 especially in supercapacitors,20 photocatalysis21–24 and electrocatalysis.25–27 In view of the aforementioned characteristics, POM-CPs may play an interesting role in the combination of solar energy and supercapacitors.
Based on the above situation, as a continuation of our work, herein, utilizing 4-(5-(2H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)pyridine (L1) (Scheme 1a) and 2-(3-carboxypyridin-2-yl) nicotinic acid (H2L2) (Scheme 1b), two POM-based CPs formulated as [Cu(HL1)2(Mo8O26)]·5H2O (1) and [{Cu4(L2)4 (H2O)6}(H3PMo12O40)]·7H2O (2) have been synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The electronic band structures of CPs 1 and 2 have been calculated using density functional theory (DFT). In an attempt to examine whether the calculation is correct, the UV-vis absorption and diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), and electrochemical and photoelectric properties of the CPs were investigated.
 Scheme 1  The schematic representations of L1 in CP 1 (a) and H2L2 in CP 2 (b). 
Furthermore, a device based on fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO)/CP 1/RuO2 was fabricated and its electrochemical and visible light-driven photoelectrochemical behaviors were investigated in an aqueous Na2SO4 solution in comparison with the individual CP 1 and the individual RuO2. Herein, RuO2 was chosen based on its good electron conductivity and it can play a commendable role in the transportation and separation of photoinduced holes and electrons.28,29 On the other hand, RuO2 is a good electrode material for supercapacitors; it was expected that the photoinduced electrons can be captured by RuO2 for the redox reaction to achieve the transformation of solar energy to electric energy.
Methanol (CH3OH) is a common sacrificial reagent in the photocatalytic reaction.30,31 In the present work, CH3OH was introduced into the electrolyte solution for comparative experiments in an attempt to further gain insight into the separation efficiency of photoinduced holes and electrons with and without the aid of the methanol sacrificial reagent.
Experimental section
Materials
All the starting materials were of analytical grade and directly used without further purification. Nafion perfluorinated resin solution (5 wt%) and RuO2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. A fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrate (12–14 μS m−1) was purchased from Hefei Kejing Co.
Characterization
The melting point was determined using uncorrected X-4 melting point apparatus of Beijing Kaifu Company. C, H, and N elemental analyses were performed on an Elementar Vario MICRO E III analyzer. IR spectra were recorded as KBr pellets on a Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer. The powder XRD (PXRD) data were collected on a TD-3500 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. UV-Vis absorption and diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on a TU-1901 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The morphologies, energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) and elemental mappings were obtained by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7600F, JEOL).
Computational methods
The band structure and density of states (DOS) of CPs 1 and 2 and RuO2 are based on density functional theory (DFT) treating exchange correlation energy with a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional using the Cambridge serial total energy package (CASTEP) module implemented in the Material Studio 7.0 program. First, we respectively optimized their unit cell structures based on their crystallographic data. In order to simplify the calculation, the uncoordinated water molecules were removed from the crystallographic data of CPs 1 and 2. And the crystallographic data of RuO2 were referred to the ICSD database (no. 15071). Then the electronic band structure was calculated based on the optimized structure. For the two steps, all atoms are described by an ultrasoft pseudopotential in a reciprocal space with 1.0 × 10−5 eV per atom of SCF tolerance threshold. The basic parameters were chosen as follows in setting up the CASTEP run: kinetic energy cutoff = 500 eV, set of k points = 2 × 2 × 2 for CP 1; kinetic energy cutoff = 300 eV, set of k points = 2 × 2 × 2 for CP 2; kinetic energy cutoff = 500 eV, set of k points = 10 × 10 × 10 for RuO2.
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
In this study, all the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical tests were carried out by using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., China) at room temperature. Firstly, a FTO-coated glass substrate was cleaned with acetone, ethanol and deionized water successively with the help of an ultrasonicator. Then 2 mg of CP 1 was ultrasonicated in 2 mL ethanol and 0.05 mL Nafion. Finally, 1 mL of the well dispersed mixture was dropped on the cleaned FTO-coated substrate with an effective area of 1.0 × 1.0 cm2 and then dried by using an IR lamp (mass loading of CP 1: 1 mg cm−2). A three-electrode cell was fabricated using the deposited FTO (FTO/CP 1) as the working electrode, platinum foil as the counter electrode and an AgCl/Ag electrode as the reference electrode. A 0.2 M aqueous Na2SO4 solution (50 mL) was used as the electrolyte. According to the Nernst equation, the potential values can be converted to those with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE): E(vs. NHE) = E(vs. AgCl/Ag) + 0.059 pH + 0.198 [Eθ(vs. AgCl/Ag) = 0.198 V (vs. NHE)]. The Mott–Schottky experiment was performed at the frequency of 1 kHz in the range of −0.6–1.5 V vs. AgCl/Ag in order to determine the flat-band potential of the sample. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed over the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz at a potential of 0 V vs. AgCl/Ag and the amplitude of the potential perturbation was 5 mV. The working electrode was irradiated with a 300 W xenon lamp (CEL-HXF300, Beijing Aulight Co., λ > 420 nm) from the backside under the condition of 100 mW cm−2 for the photoelectrochemical measurements.
The device, FTO/CP 1/RuO2, was fabricated using a method similar to that for FTO/CP 1, in which 0.7 mL of well dispersed RuO2 ink was additionally dropped onto the surface of CP 1 (mass loading of RuO2: 0.7 mg cm−2). And the RuO2 ink was obtained from the homogeneous dispersion of 2 mg RuO2 in 2 mL ethanol and 0.05 mL Nafion. In comparison, the RuO2-modified FTO (FTO/RuO2) (mass loading of RuO2: 0.7 mg cm−2) was also prepared according to the same procedure for the preparation of FTO/CP 1. The FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device and the FTO/RuO2 device were also used as the working electrodes for the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements.

Results and discussion
Crystal structure of [Cu(HL1)2(Mo8O26)]·5H2O (1)
CP 1 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P (Table 1), and its asymmetric unit contains one Cu(II) located at the inversion center, one protonated ligand (HL1)+, half Mo8O264− (Fig. 1a), and 2.5 uncoordinated H2O molecules. The crystallographically independent Cu(II) is six-coordinated by two N atoms of two 1,2,4-triazol groups from two (HL1)+ [Cu–N: 1.990(5) Å] and four terminal O atoms from two Mo8O264− groups [Cu–O: 1.962(4) Å] (Fig. 1b and Table S1†). In CP 1, the crystallographically independent (HL1)+ is a planar N-donor, which acts as a terminal ligand with its pyridine N coordinated to the Cu(II) center (Fig. 1b). In CP 1, each Mo center in the Mo8O264− anion is coordinated by six O atoms to furnish a distorted octahedral geometry (Mo–O: 1.678(4)–2.426(4) Å) (Fig. 1a and Table S1†). Valence sum calculations show that all the Mo atoms are in the +6 oxidation state.40 The neighboring Mo8O264− units are connected by sharing two μ2-bridging O atoms into a one-dimensional (1D) [Mo8O26]n chain (Fig. 1c and 2a). And different 1D inorganic chains are further linked by Cu(II) centers via Cu–O bonds into a two-dimensional (2D) layer (Fig. 2a) with the terminal planar ligands (HL1)+ dangling above or below the layer plane. In CP 1, each Cu(II) links two Mo8O264− anions, which can be considered as a 2-connected node, and the 2-connected node is not taken account of topologically.42 Each Mo8O264− anion is considered as a building block, it connects with two neighboring Mo8O264− anions via two μ2-bridging O atoms and another two Mo8O264− anions via two Cu(II)–O bonds, and it can be regarded as a 4-connected node with a Schlafli symbol of (44·62). Topological analysis using TOPOS software indicates that CP 1 displays a uninodal 4-connected 2D layer with a 44-sql topology (Fig. 2b).43

Due to the strong π–π stacking interactions between the interlayer dangling (HL1)+ ligands, CP 1 exhibits a three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular architecture (Fig. 2c). For example, the centroid–centroid and perpendicular distances between planes N2/N3/C7/N4/C6 and N2A/N3A/C7A/N4A/C6A are 3.679(5) and 3.439(3) Å, respectively (atoms with additional label A refer to the symmetry operation: 1 − x, 1 − y, 1 − z). In addition, strong intermolecular H bonds are observed between the Mo8O264− moiety and the (HL1)+ ligand in CP 1. For instance, the N1–H1A⋯O13 distance is 2.725(8) Å, while the angle of N1–H1A⋯O13 is 158° (atom with additional label A refers to the symmetry operation: 1 − x, 1 − y, −z). CP 1 is not soluble in water. Its good water-resistant behavior is probably associated with the strong hydrophobic interlayer π–π stacking interactions and the intermolecular H bonds.
Crystal structure of [{Cu4(L2)4(H2O)6}(H3PMo12O40)]·7H2O (2)
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that CP 2 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P (Table 1), with four Cu(II) ions, four (L2)2−, one H3PMo12O40, six coordinated water and seven uncoordinated water molecules in the asymmetric unit. As shown in Fig. 3a, one crystallographically independent (L2)2− acts as a terminal ligand with two pyridine N atoms chelated with one Cu(II) center, leaving two carboxylate groups uncoordinated. One (L2)2− ligand acts as a μ2-bridge and links two Cu(II) ions with one carboxylate group and two chelating coordinated pyridine N atoms, leaving one carboxylate group uncoordinated. And another μ2-(L2)2− ligand is bonded to one Cu(II) with two monodentate carboxylate groups and one chelating Cu(II) center via its two pyridine N atoms. The fourth crystallographically independent (L2)2− connects three Cu(II) ions with two monodentate bridging carboxylate groups and two chelating coordinated N atoms (Fig. 3a). The dihedral angles between the two pyridine rings of the above ligands are 32.9, 29.0, 31.1 and 25.6°, respectively.
 Fig. 3  A Cu8 cage constructed from six bridging Cu(II) ions, six bridging ligands, two terminal Cu(II) and two terminal (L2)2− ligands in CP 2 (a); 2D architecture constructed from Cu(II) ions, ligands and H3PMo12O40 (H atoms omitted for clarity) (b); schematic illustrating the 4-nodal (3, 4)-connected 2D framework with a novel (3·6·7) (3·62·7·82) (3·63·8·9) (62·9) topology in CP 2 (sapphire nodes, H3PMo12O40; green, Cu(II)) (c). 
A Cu8 cage is observed in the structure of the CP, which is constructed by eight Cu(II) ions, six bridging ligands and two terminal (L2)2− ligands (Fig. 3a). From the view of topology, the terminal ligand (L2)2− and the two μ2-(L2)2− ligands in the Cu8 cage are not counted as nodes topologically.41
Cu(1) exhibits a distorted octahedral coordination geometry, being coordinated by two N atoms from one μ3-(L2)2−, one carboxylate O atom from one μ2-(L2)2−, one O atom from the aqua ligand [Cu–N: 1.978(10)–1.987(10) Å, Cu–O: 1.916(8)–1.963(9) Å] (Table S1†) and two terminal O atoms from two H3PMo12O40 [Cu–O: 2.701(9) Å] (Fig. 3a). Then Cu(1) is connected with two Cu(II) ions and two POMs; it can be viewed as a 4-connected node with a Schläfli symbol of (3·63·8·9) (Fig. 3a). Cu(2) shows a distorted tetragonal pyramidal coordination environment, defined by two N atoms from one μ2-(L2)2−, two carboxylate O atoms from another μ2-(L2)2− [Cu–N: 1.996(9)–1.997(9) Å, Cu–O: 1.959(8)–1.960(8) Å] (Fig. 3a and Table S1†) and one terminal O atom from H3PMo12O40 [Cu–O: 2.278(9) Å]; thus Cu(2) links two neighboring Cu(II) ions and one POM, and it can be considered as a 3-connected node with a Schläfli symbol of (62·9) (Fig. 3a). Cu(3) is five coordinated by two N atoms from one terminal (L2)2−, one carboxylate O atom from μ3-(L2)2− and two O atoms from two water molecules to furnish a tetragonal pyramidal coordination environment [Cu–N: 1.974(11)–1.987(9) Å, Cu–O: 1.936(9)–1.938(8) Å] (Fig. 3a and Table S1†). The unsaturated coordinated Cu(3) links two Cu(II) centers via μ3-(L2)2− (Fig. 2a) and it is not counted as a node topologically.42 Cu(4) is six coordinated by two N atoms from one μ2-(L2)2−, one carboxylate O atom from μ3-(L2)2−, two O atoms from two water molecules [Cu–N: 1.974(10)–1.989(10) Å, Cu–O: 1.991(9) Å] (Fig. 3a and Table S2†) and one terminal O atom from one H3PMo12O40 [Cu–O: 2.235(9) Å] to furnish a distorted octahedral coordination environment (Fig. 3a); therefore Cu(4) links with two Cu(II) ions and one POM, and it can be considered as a 3-connected node with a Schläfli symbol of (3·6·7). The H3PMo12O40 anion is connected with four Cu(II) ions and it can be defined as a 4-connected node with a Schläfli symbol of (3·62·7·82). Then CP 2 exhibits a novel 4-nodal (3,4)-connected 2D architecture with a (3·6·7) (3·62·7·82) (3·63·8·9) (62·9) topology (Fig. 3b and c).43
In CP 2, strong intermolecular H bonds are observed between the uncoordinated and coordinated water molecules, or between the water molecules with the 2D framework of CP 2 (Table S3†). In contrast, different from CP 1, there are no strong interlayer π–π stacking interactions in CP 2, which is probably associated with the nonplanar ligand in CP 2 and its different 2D topological framework. Furthermore, it is found that CP 2 dissolves in water, which is probably due to the rich water-involved H bond interactions in its structure.
UV-vis absorption and diffuse reflectance spectra
The experimental PXRD patterns of CPs 1 and 2 match well with their respective simulated ones (generated on the basis of the single crystal structures of the sample or the dehydrated sample), confirming the phase purities of the bulk materials (Fig. S2a and b†). Fig. S3† shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of CPs 1 and 2 at room temperature. As shown in Fig. S3,† CP 1 exhibits an intense absorption peak at 349 nm in the range of 230–523 nm, with two shoulder peaks at ca. 264 and 412 nm in a similar range corresponding to the n–π* and π–π* transitions of the aromatic organic tectons.42,43 As for CP 2, it exhibits a strong absorption peak at 300 nm with a shoulder peak at 385 nm (Fig. S3†). They may be ascribed to the intraligand transition (ILCT) or ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transition (LMCT).42,43 In addition, the adsorption peaks at 831 nm for CP 1 and 664 nm for CP 2 are ascribed to the visible d–d transition (Fig. S3†).
The diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra (DRS) of CPs 1 and 2 were also investigated (Fig. S4†). The optical band gaps of the two CPs can be obtained by DRS. First, F(R) can be calculated according to the Kubelka–Munk function F(R) = (1 − R)2/2R, in which R is the reflectance of the sample at a given wavelength. Then based on the transformed Kubelka–Munk function [F(R)hν]1/2 = A(hν − Eg), in which A is a constant, a plot of [F(R)hν]1/2 against energy hν can be drawn. The optical band gap energy (Eg) of the sample is determined as the intersection point between the energy hν axis and the line extrapolated from the linear portion of the plot of [F(R)hν]1/2 against hν.44 As shown in Fig. S4,† the band gaps for CPs 1 and 2 are 1.22 and 0.05 eV, respectively.
Band structures and orbital populations of CPs 1 and 2
In order to investigate the electronic band structures of the two CPs, theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) for CPs 1 and 2 were performed in the first Brillouin zone with the path of Γ(gamma)-F-Q-Z-Γ(gamma) in the reciprocal space. As shown in Fig. 4a, based on the energy difference between the valence band maximum (VBM) at the Γ(gamma) point (−1.045 eV) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) at the Z point (0.004 eV), it is indicated that CP 1 is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap of 1.049 eV, which is a bit lower than the experimentally determined value (1.22 eV). Conventionally, the DFT method underestimates the band gap in comparison with the experimental value, inferring that our theoretical calculation method for CP 1 is relatively accurate.

Similarly, as shown in Fig. 5a, based on the energy difference between the VBM at the F point (0 eV) and the CBM at the Γ(gamma) point (0.024 eV), CP 2 possesses an indirect band gap of 0.024 eV, also a bit lower than the experimentally determined value (0.05 eV).

The total density of states (TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) for the two CPs were calculated. As shown in Fig. 4b, the VBM of CP 1 is composed of Cu 3d, N 2p and O 2p states, whereas its CBM is mainly made up of Mo 4d, O 2p and N 2p states. The different orbital constituents of the CBM and VBM lead to the obviously discernible band gap of the CP.
As shown in Fig. 5b, the VBM of CP 2 is mainly made up of Cu 3d, Mo 4d, C 2p, N 2p and O 2p states, which is similar to the CBM of CP 2 (Fig. 5b), indicating the small difference of the two bands in CP 2. As a consequence, the band gap of CP 2 is close to zero, suggesting that it is not a semiconductor material.
Furthermore, the band structure and orbital populations of RuO2 were also calculated in comparison. As shown in Fig. S5,† the calculation for RuO2 was performed in the first Brillouin zone with the path of Z-A-M-Γ(gamma)-Z-R-X-Γ(gamma) in the reciprocal space. More than one band cross the Fermi level (Fig. S5a†), and a continuous DOS occurs around the Fermi level (Fig. S5b†), which means that RuO2 possesses a metallic character and it is a good electron conductor.
Band energy levels of CP 1
In order to reveal the band energy levels of CP 1, the Mott–Schottky curve was recorded to determine the flat-band potential of the CP. Due to the water-resistant property of CP 1, herein, aqueous Na2SO4 solution (0.2 M, 50 mL) was utilized as the electrolyte solution. The Mott–Schottky experiment was performed in the dark in a three-electrode cell with CP 1-modified FTO (FTO/CP 1), platinum foil and a AgCl/Ag electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The potential range was set as −0.6 to 1.5 V vs. AgCl/Ag with a frequency of 1000 Hz, and the amplitude of the potential perturbation was 5 mV. As shown in Fig. S6,† the flat-band potential of CP 1 can be estimated from the intercept of the extrapolated straight line on the horizontal axis, which was −0.53 V vs. AgCl/Ag, or 0.08 V vs. NHE (−0.53 + 0.198 + 0.059 × 7 = 0.08). If converted with respect to the vacuum level, the value was −4.58 eV vs. vacuum [−(4.5 + 0.08) = −4.58]. Furthermore, the Mott–Schottky plot of CP 1 presented a positive slope in the above potential region, illustrating the n-type semiconductor characteristics of the sample. Then the conduction band minimum (CBM) energy level of CP 1 was approximated to be −4.58 eV vs. vacuum. The band gap of CP 1 was 1.22 eV; therefore, its valence band maximum (VBM) energy level was −5.80 eV vs. vacuum (−4.58–1.22 = −5.80).
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical responses of CP 1 in the absence and presence of methanol
The semiconductor characteristics of CPs can be examined by performing the photocurrent generation experiment in the above three-electrode cell with a 0.2 M aqueous Na2SO4 solution (50 mL) as the electrolyte. The investigation was conducted at a constant bias of 0 V vs. AgCl/Ag with the CP 1-modified FTO slice (FTO/CP 1) irradiated by intermittent visible light (λ > 420 nm, 100 mW cm−2) from the back side. The light irradiation interval was 100 s with a whole test time of 1800 s.
As shown in Fig. 6a, it was found that FTO/CP 1 showed a photocurrent density of ca. 1.4 × 10−3 mA cm−2, which proves that CP 1 is a good semiconductor. Furthermore, when 0.5 M methanol was added into the aqueous Na2SO4 solution, it was found that the photocurrent density (ca. 2.6 × 10−3 mA cm−2) yielded at the FTO/CP 1 electrode was nearly twice that in the pure Na2SO4 solution, suggesting that the methanol in the electrolyte was beneficial for the charge transfer at the interface between CP 1 and the electrolyte solution.
 Fig. 6  Photocurrent response of FTO/CP 1 under chopped visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm, 100 mW cm−2) at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in aqueous Na2SO4 solution with (red) and without (blue) methanol (a); CVs of FTO/CP 1 at 0.01 V s−1 in Na2SO4 solution in the absence (blue) and presence (red) of methanol with (solid line) and without (dotted line) visible light illumination (b). 
Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at 0 V vs. AgCl/Ag in the absence and presence of methanol with and without visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm, 100 mW cm−2). Fig. S7† shows the Nyquist plots of CP 1 under different conditions, in which the semicircle in the high frequency region reflects the charge transfer impedance (Rct). The semidiameters of the semicircles were in the order as follows: with methanol under illumination (7000 Ω) < with methanol in the dark < without methanol under illumination (75000 Ω) < without methanol in the dark. It can be seen that the visible light illumination and the addition of methanol both can promote interfacial charge transfer and reduce the Rct, which can account for the generation of a visible light-driven photoresponse and the enhanced photocurrent density in the presence of methanol.
In an attempt to reveal the photovoltaic behavior of CP 1 in a wide potential range, CVs of FTO/CP 1 in the above three-electrode cell with and without methanol were investigated at 0.01 V s−1 in the dark. As shown in Fig. 6b, when the aqueous electrolyte solution (0.2 M Na2SO4, 50 mL) contained methanol (0.5 M), the CV of FTO/CP 1 showed a couple of redox waves in the range of −0.1–0.8 V vs. AgCl/Ag. Whereas in the absence of methanol, the pair of redox waves almost disappeared, indicating that the redox waves were associated with the electron transfer between CH3OH and CP 1, which can account for the aforementioned enhanced photocurrent density at 0 V vs. AgCl/Ag in the presence of methanol (Fig. 6a).
In addition, CVs of FTO/CP 1 with visible light illumination (λ > 420 nm, 100 mW cm−2) were recorded for comparison. It was found that when irradiated by visible light, the redox waves at CP 1 in the range of −0.1–0.8 V vs. AgCl/Ag were not increased remarkably; they were similar to those without light irradiation under the same other conditions (Fig. 6b). The phenomena were in agreement with the photocurrent densities yielded at 0 V vs. AgCl/Ag either without or with methanol, which were only in the magnitude of 10−3 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6a).
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical responses of FTO/CP 1/RuO2 in the absence and presence of methanol
In order to promote the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes, the RuO2 layer was covered onto the surface of CP 1 to fabricate a device of FTO/CP 1/RuO2. Herein, RuO2 is chosen based on the consideration that RuO2 is a traditional electrode material in supercapacitors with good electron conductivity, as evidenced by our DFT calculation (Fig. S5†). Due to the admirable electron conductivity of the RuO2 layer, the photoinduced electrons can be transferred from CP 1 to RuO2 to improve the separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs and strengthen the photoelectric response of CP 1. On the other hand, with the injection of photoinduced electrons from CP 1 to RuO2, faradaic reactions occur within the supercapacitor electrode of RuO2 to achieve the transformation of solar energy to chemical energy.
In order to prove the above expectation, firstly, the energy levels of the components in the device were explored. Fig. 7a shows the energy level diagram. As shown in Fig. 7a, the work function of FTO is −4.4 eV vs. vacuum,45,46 higher than the CBM level of CP 1 (−4.58 eV vs. vacuum). Therefore, as shown in Fig. 7b, in the above three-electrode cell, the electrons from the counter electrode of the Pt slice flowed into the FTO slice, and then could be transferred to the CBM of CP 1. Then the electrons provided by the electric source and the photoexcited electrons of CP 1 can be captured by the RuO2 layer for faradaic reactions.
 Fig. 7  Energy level diagram of the components in the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device in comparison with the oxidation potential of methanol (a) and the electron-transfer (denoted by cyan arrows) during the discharging process and the hole-transfer during the charging process (denoted by black arrows) in the three-electrode cell (the reference electrode omitted for clarity) (b). 
In contrast, the VBM level of CP 1 (−5.80 eV vs. vacuum) was lower than the work function of RuO2 (−5.2 eV vs. vacuum),47,48 and both of them were lower than the oxidation potential of methanol (Fig. 7a). Therefore, the photoinduced holes of CP 1 can be captured by RuO2 and methanol for the oxidation reaction (Fig. 7b).
The fabrication of the device, FTO/CP 1/RuO2, was seen in the Experimental section, which included a conductive substrate FTO, a CP film and a RuO2 layer. The mass loadings of CP 1 and RuO2 were 1.0 and 0.7 mg cm−2, respectively. The SEM images of CP 1-modified FTO (FTO/CP 1), RuO2-modified FTO (FTO/RuO2) and the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device are shown in Fig. S8a–c, S8d–f and S8(e and g),† respectively. As shown in Fig. S8a–c,† CP 1 can form a continuous film on the surface of the FTO slice with a thickness of ca. 100 nm. However, as for RuO2, it was easily crystallized into particles, but not a continuous and integral membrane or film, as shown in Fig. S8d–f;† then the surface of the FTO slice cannot be completely covered by RuO2 particles. Similarly, as for the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device, RuO2 particles formed individual RuO2 islands on the surface of CP 1, but not a continuous RuO2 film, as shown in Fig. S8(g and h).† EDS for the individual FTO/CP 1, FTO/RuO2 and FTO/CP 1/RuO2 were measured, in which the Cu/Mo/O elements were from CP 1, and the Sn/Si/F/O elements were from the FTO slice. Elemental mappings demonstrated the homogeneous distribution of each component on the surface (Fig. S9a–c†). As a result, when the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 composite electrode was immersed in the electrolyte solution, both the underneath CP 1 layer and the outmost RuO2 could be exposed to the substances in the electrolyte solution such as methanol, suggesting that the photoinduced holes of CP 1 can be transferred to RuO2, then successively to methanol, or they can be captured by methanol directly.
The photocurrent responses of the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device were measured in a similar three-electrode cell. The FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device was used as the working electrode in a 0.2 M aqueous Na2SO4 solution (50 mL) with or without methanol (0.5 M). The device was irradiated by visible light (λ > 420 nm, 100 mW cm−2) from the back side, and the photocurrent versus time curve at 0 V vs. AgCl/Ag is shown in Fig. 8a. As shown in Fig. 8a, the largest photocurrent density generated on FTO/CP 1/RuO2 without and with methanol was ca. 1.8 × 10−2 and 3.2 × 10−2 mA cm−2, respectively, which was ca. 13 and 23 times the value observed at the individual CP 1 in the absence of methanol (1.4 × 10−3 mA cm−2), respectively. The greatly improved photocurrent responses of FTO/CP 1/RuO2 in comparison with CP 1 were as expected, suggesting the more efficient separation of photoinduced electrons and holes in the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device.

To further gain insight into the different photovoltaic behaviors of CP 1 and the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at 0 V vs. AgCl/Ag in the absence and presence of light irradiation. The Nyquist plots of FTO/CP 1/RuO2 are shown in Fig. 8b. The EIS data can be fitted with the simulated equivalent circuit of LRs(C(RctQ)) via the ZsimpWin software,49 in which L is the inductive impedance, Rs represents the solution resistance, C is the double-layer capacitance, and Rct represents the charge transfer resistance. Q shows the constant phase element (CPE), which is used to modify the double-layer capacitance of the electrode for the purpose of obtaining more accurate fitting results. The values of the above parameters are shown in Table S3.† As shown in Fig. 8b and Table S3,† as for FTO/CP 1/RuO2, the interfacial charge-transfer impedances followed the order: with methanol under illumination (18.75 Ω) < with methanol in the dark (19.79 Ω) < without methanol under illumination (39.72 Ω) < without methanol in the dark (45.47 Ω).
Similarly, it was found that light illumination can promote interfacial charge transfer and reduce the Rct. And it is worth noting that the Rct values for FTO/CP 1/RuO2 were much lower than those observed for the individual CP 1 under the same conditions, further demonstrating that the transfer of photoexcited electrons and holes in the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device was much more efficient than that in the individual CP 1, thus giving rise to a much larger photocurrent density in the device. In addition, with the introduction of methanol into the electrolyte solution, the interfacial charge-transfer impedance dropped sharply, proving that methanol may act as a hole scavenger, leading to the effective transfer and separation of electron–hole pairs to give an enhanced photoresponse.
Meanwhile, the EIS of the individual RuO2 was measured under the same conditions for comparison. As shown in Fig. 8b and Table S3,† the Rct for FTO/RuO2 with methanol under illumination was the least (8.66 Ω), which was lower than those for FTO/CP 1/RuO2. The phenomenon was in agreement with the good electron conductivity of RuO2.
In order to investigate the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical behaviors of the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device in a wide potential range, CVs of the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 composite electrode were recorded in the potential range of −0.8–1.0 V vs. AgCl/Ag at 0.01 V s−1 with or without illumination (λ > 420 nm, 100 mW cm−2) in a 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution (50 mL) including or excluding methanol (0.5 M) (Fig. 9a). In Fig. 9a, the CV curves show that the current densities obviously increased in the potential range of −0.2–0.8 V vs. AgCl/Ag when illumination was provided, especially in the presence of methanol, indicating the photoresponse behavior of the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device in the whole potential range of −0.2 to 0.8 V vs. AgCl/Ag.
 Fig. 9  CVs (a) and GCD curves (b) of FTO/CP 1/RuO2 in Na2SO4 solution in the absence and presence of methanol with (solid line) and without (dotted line) visible light illumination. 
It is worth mentioning that the CV of the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device in the presence of methanol showed a couple of obvious redox peaks in the potential range from −0.2 to 0.8 V vs. AgCl/Ag, as shown in Fig. 9a, which disappeared in the CV of the device without methanol, confirming that the redox reactions were associated with the redox reaction of methanol. Furthermore, the areas surrounded within the CV curves in the presence of methanol were much larger than those without methanol, suggesting that the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 possessed a larger capacity than the individual CP electrode. Then galvanostatic charging–discharging (GCD) curves were recorded in the potential range of −0.2 to 0.8 V vs. AgCl/Ag at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 (the mass was calculated based on CP 1). As shown in Fig. 9b, with the addition of methanol, the charging time for the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 composite electrode was increased from 115 to 405 s, and further visible light illumination caused the charging time to be increased up to 1207 s. The corresponding specific capacity was 11.5, 40.5 and 120.7 C g−1, respectively. The increased capacity of the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device in the presence of methanol was in agreement with its CV curves, which was ascribed to the methanol-involved redox reactions (Fig. 9a). Visible light illumination can improve the specific capacity of the device, which proved the contribution of photoinduced electrons to the faradaic process.
As shown in Fig. 7b, during the discharging process, the photoinduced electrons of CP 1 can be captured by RuO2 for the reduction reaction, leading to much longer discharging time than that in the dark. Whereas during the charging process, due to the matched VBM level of CP 1 with the working function of RuO2 (Fig. 7a), the photoinduced holes from CP 1 can be transferred to RuO2 and captured by RuO2 for the oxidation reaction to achieve the transformation of solar energy to chemical energy (Fig. 7b). Moreover, due to the oxidation potential of methanol being higher than the VBM of CP 1 and the work function of RuO2 (Fig. 7a), methanol also can capture the photogenerated holes (Fig. 7b), and it was beneficial for the separation of electron–hole pairs to improve the photovoltaic effect of FTO/CP 1/RuO2. As a consequence, the discharging time of the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 composite electrode with methanol under illumination was the longest in all cases, and this discharging curve displayed an obvious discharging plateau at ca. −0.2 to 0 V vs. AgCl/Ag (Fig. 9b), proving the battery-like supercapacitive behavior of the composite electrode, which originated from the redox reactions.
In an attempt to investigate the effect of each individual component on the device to further verify the above synergistic effect, CV and GCD curves of FTO/CP 1 and RuO2-modified FTO (FTO/RuO2) under the same circumstances were recorded for comparison.
As shown in Fig. S10a,† the redox waves in the CVs of the individual CP 1 almost can be neglected in comparison with those for FTO/CP 1/RuO2 under the same conditions, suggesting that the device showed much larger electrochemical and photoelectrochemical responses than the individual CP. The GCD curves of the individual CP 1 in the Na2SO4 solution with or without methanol in the presence and absence of visible light illumination are shown in Fig. S10b.† As shown in Fig. S10b,† CP 1 showed poor charging–discharging performances with charging/discharging time of 2–3 s (specific capacity: <1 C g−1) under the above conditions, which could be explained by the large impedance of the CP, as evidenced by the EIS spectra of CP 1 at 0 V vs. AgCl/Ag. The stability of CP 1 was explored, which was evaluated by 1000 GCD cycles at 0.1 A g−1 in the potential range of −0.2–0.8 V vs. AgCl/Ag in the dark in a 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution. As shown in Fig. S10c,† the capacity retentions of CP 1 were 71.3 and 67.0% after 500 and 1000 GCD cycles, respectively.
The CV curves of FTO/RuO2 at 0.01 V s−1 with or without methanol in the absence and presence of visible light illumination (λ > 420 nm, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 10a. It was found that the CV curves of RuO2 were almost rectangular in the potential range of −0.8–1.0 V vs. AgCl/Ag, and no additional redox wave was observed after the injection of methanol into the electrolyte solution (Fig. 10a), suggesting that there was no reaction between RuO2 and methanol. The result further proved that the redox reaction of methanol at the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 composite electrode was not related to RuO2 but to CP 1 (Fig. 6b). As for the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 composite electrode, though the surface of CP 1 was covered by RuO2, CP 1 could still be exposed to methanol in the electrolyte solution due to the partial and incomplete coverage by RuO2, as the SEM images of the device show in Fig. S8h.†
 Fig. 10  Comparisons of CVs (a) and GCD curves (b) for FTO/RuO2 and FTO/CP 1/RuO2 in the Na2SO4 solution in the absence and presence of methanol with (solid line) and without (dotted line) visible light illumination. 
It was found that the GCD curves of RuO2 at 0.1 A g−1 in all cases exhibited typical triangles, in which no charging–discharging plateaus were observed (Fig. 10b). Besides, the difference of GCD curves with and without visible light illumination was small and can almost be neglected (Fig. 10b), which was in agreement with the good electron conductivity of RuO2. RuO2 can be considered as a conductor, not a semiconductor. In contrast, the CV area for the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device was much bigger than those of the individual RuO2 (Fig. 10a) and the individual CP 1 (Fig. S9a†), showing a synergistical effect between them in the device. As shown in Fig. 10b, the discharging time of RuO2 with methanol under illumination was 105 s with a specific capacity of 10.5 C g−1, which was much shorter than 1207 s of the discharging time for the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device (specific capacity: 120.7 C g−1) under similar conditions. The data further proved that the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device showed a much improved photocurrent response with methanol under illumination than the individual RuO2 and CP 1 due to their matched energy levels.
Conclusion
Based on L1 and H2L2, two CPs formulated as [Cu(HL1)2(Mo8O26)]·5H2O (1) and [{Cu4(L2)4(H2O)6} (H3PMo12O40)]·7H2O (2) were synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. CP 1 exhibits a 44-sql 2D layer with strong interlayer π–π stacking interactions between the dangling (HL1)+ ligands. As a consequence, CP 1 is not soluble in water. CP 2 shows a novel 4-nodal (3,4)-connected 2D architecture with a (3·6·7) (3·62·7·82) (3·63·8·9) (62·9) topology without strong interlayer π–π stacking interactions, and it is dissolved in water. DRS and DFT calculations reveal that CP 1 is a semiconductor with a narrow band gap of 1.22 eV, and it exhibits a visible light-driven photoresponse in aqueous Na2SO4 solution. A device based on FTO/CP 1/RuO2 was constructed, and it showed a much more enhanced visible light-driven photoresponse than the individual CP 1 under the same conditions, especially in the presence of methanol (0.5 M). And the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 composite electrode presented a much larger specific capacity (120.7 C g−1) in a potential range of −0.2 to 0.8 V vs. AgCl/Ag at 0.1 A g−1 with methanol under visible light illumination than the value (11.5 C g−1) of the device obtained without methanol in the dark. The increased specific capacity suggested the conversion from solar energy, chemical energy to electric energy. Moreover, the capacity of the FTO/CP 1/RuO2 device (120.7 C g−1) was much larger than that of individual RuO2 (10.5 C g−1) and CP 1 (<1 C g−1) with methanol under visible light illumination, which was due to the matched energy levels between the components in the device and the oxidation potential of methanol in the electrolyte solution, which was beneficial for the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes, leading to an improved photovoltaic effect.
The present work demonstrates that CPs with suitable energy levels can be used as light absorbents based on their semiconductor characteristics. And the CP-based supercapacitors can be driven by visible light and electric power to achieve the transformation from solar energy, chemical energy to electric energy. On the other hand, herein, methanol acted as a hole scavenger and it can be oxidized into other chemicals in the presence of the visible light illumination. If the conversion efficiency and selectivity of methanol are improved, it may provide a strategy to make use of solar energy for methanol conversion without the use of noble metal catalyst. The detailed mechanism is under investigation.
