    , Accepted 11th April 2020First published on 18th April 2020AbstractHerein, a superhydrophobic coating with high transparency and ultrahigh adhesive force was designed and prepared for use on the glass covers of solar cells, which exhibited excellent thermal stability and strong acid–base corrosion resistance. SiO2, as the bottom layer, was prepared via plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and then glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (KH560) hydrolysis condensation resulted in the formation of hydroxyl groups at the two ends, which were used to form a network structure as the middle connecting layer. The top superhydrophobic layer was obtained via the hydrophilic modification of SiO2 by hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). The structure of this superhydrophobic surface is similar to the bilayer structure of the phospholipids in the cell membrane. The superhydrophobic coating exhibited high optical transmittance, which reached 94% in the visible region. The results show that the superhydrophobic coating has an excellent self-cleaning performance (WCA = 153°). Moreover, its surface showed remarkable stability against strong acid, strong alkali, and the impact of water drops and sand. Finally, a simple simulation of silicon-based superhydrophobic glass solar cells was carried out, and a long-term outdoor experiment was performed to test their photoelectric conversion efficiency. During the two-month study period, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cell module without the coating was reduced to 13.01% due to the natural deposition of dust, which was significantly lower than that of the superhydrophobic coating-covered module with self-cleaning function (PCE was 14.21%).
1. Introduction
Solar cells, as the latest energy devices, are the most favored in the generation of energy due to their numerous attractive characteristics, including low material cost, environmentally friendly nature and renewability. However, the solar photovoltaic (PV) modules installed for power generation are usually affected by many environmental factors, such as available solar radiation, wind speed and direction, ambient temperature, humidity, and atmospheric dust.1,2 Therefore, the key to ensuring the long-term and efficient functioning of solar cells is developing solar panels with long-term pollution resistance.
Inspired by the lotus leaf, scientists have focused on exploring the physical and chemical mechanisms of superhydrophobicity in nature and fabricating primary superhydrophobic materials, such as water-proof textiles, oil/water separators, and self-cleaning surfaces.3–7 Surfaces with water contact angles (WCAs) greater than 150° and roll-off angles lower than 10° are classed as superhydrophobic. When water droplets fall on a superhydrophobic surface, they easily fall off, leaving a clean surface because water either does not adhere or only weakly adheres to the surface. Therefore, there has been great effort in developing self-cleaning functionality in solar cell panels.8–12 Currently, most of the research focuses on the utilization of coatings to prepare superhydrophobic coatings since it is difficult to add superhydrophobic nanoparticles during the formation of glass. Sutha et al.13 prepared a superhydrophobic surface of alumina on glass substrates via a solution method. The resulting static contact angle was 161° with a high average transmittance of 95%, and the efficiency of solar panels contaminated by sawdust increased by 91% due to the superhydrophobic glass substrates. Therefore, superhydrophobic glass substrates can be effectively used in self-cleaning cover glass applications. Zhi et al.14 reported a durable superhydrophobic surface on glass substrates by strongly connecting a bipolar top layer to the substrate with a middle connecting layer. However, the transmittance of light was not reported. Furthermore, many researchers in this field only focus on the preparation of superhydrophobic coatings, and although great contributions have been made, they have not directly applied superhydrophobic coatings to solar panels for long-term outdoor experiments.
Previous studies have improved the stain resistance of glass. However, it is difficult to form a strong chemical bond between a coating and glass owing to the absence of active hydroxyl groups on the surface of glass, thereby making the coating extremely easy to peeled off under the action of external force, losing its effect. Therefore, the development of new functional coatings that can bond on the surface of glass with excellent stain resistance and not sacrifice its light transmittance will greatly enhance the application value of solar cells in the energy field.
In this study, based on the previous studies and improvements, we prepared a durable superhydrophobic coating with high transmittance and self-cleaning properties, which can form a strong chemical bond with the surface of glass. This superhydrophobic coating contains three layers with a stable structure due to the formation of stable chemical bonds in each layer. Initially, an antireflective silica layer with a large number of active hydroxyl groups on the surface was prepared via the PECVD method as the bottom layer. Then, KH560 with excellent optical properties was hydrolyzed to form a three-dimensional network structure of hydroxyl groups at both ends. Subsequently, one end was chemically bonded with the underlying silica, and the other end reacted with the residual hydroxyl groups on the surface of the modified superhydrophobic silica to form a stable structure. Finally, a simple simulation of silicon-based solar cells containing the superhydrophobic coating was carried out, and long-term outdoor experiments were performed to test the photoelectric conversion efficiency. The efficiency of the solar cells without the superhydrophobic coating cover was only 13.01% after 60 days of testing, which was significantly lower than that of the solar cells with the superhydrophobic coating (14.21%).
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Bare glass (20 × 20 × 1 mm) was obtained from Shanghai Jinghe Co., China. Glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (KH-560, C9H20O5Si), hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), octadecylamine (ODA), and tetraethyl silicate (TEOS) were supplied by Aladdin, Shanghai. Methanol (CH3OH) and ammonium hydroxide were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The high purity water (HPW) used in the experiments was purified using a Milli-Q Plus 185 water purification system (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and had a resistivity of 10–16 MΩ cm at 25 °C. All chemicals were used without further purification. Silicon solar cells were purchased from Wuhan Rixin Co., Ltd.
2.2 Fabrication of modified superhydrophobic SiO2 precursor solution
At room temperature, 4 mL tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and 40 mL methanol solution were added to a 50 mL beaker, stirred and dispersed by ultrasonication for 30 min. Simultaneously, 8 mL concentrated ammonia water (26% mass fraction) and 80 mL methanol solution were added to a 100 mL beaker, stirred and dispersed by ultrasonication for 30 min. Then the TEOS methanol solution, which was fully and uniformly dispersed, was mixed with the diluted and dispersed ammonia solution, and then the silica gel was prepared by dispersing this mixture for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the prepared silica was modified via a hydrothermal method. 20 g silica gel was added to a Teflon reactor with 30 mL methanol solution, and 7.5 mL HMDS was added accurately, and then the reactor was placed in an oven at 80 °C for 6 h. Subsequently, it was left to cool at room temperature, and the modified superhydrophobic SiO2 precursor solution was obtained.
2.3 Fabrication of superhydrophobic coating with bottom SiO2 layer
SiO2 nano-films with a large amount of active hydroxyl groups were prepared on glass substrates via the PECVD method. The reaction temperature was 250 °C, the deposition pressure was 90 Pa, the RF power was 50 W and the deposition time was 5 min. SiH4 (helium mixture, 10% silane volume) and N2O (99.999% purity) were used as the reaction gas sources. The gas flow rate of SiH4 was 65 sccm (sccm: standard milliliter/minute) and N2O was 450 sccm. High purity nitrogen (99.999%) was the scavenging gas, and its flow rate was controlled to be at least 13.4 sccm.
2.4 Fabrication of superhydrophobic coating with middle connecting layer precursor solution
At room temperature, 50 mL ethanol and 10 mL deionized water were added to a 100 mL beaker, and 3 mL KH560 was accurately measured using a measuring cylinder and dripped into the ethanol solution, sealed with fresh-keeping film, stirred, and ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min. Subsequently, 0.6 g octadecylamine (ODA) was added to the uniformly dispersed solution. This mixture was stirred and dispersed by ultrasonication for 2 h to form the middle connecting layer precursor solution.
Then, the glass-deposited SiO2 layer was coated with the middle connecting layer precursor solution via spin-coating at 400 rpm for 6 s, then at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and dried in an oven at 90 °C for 30 min in an air atmosphere to remove the excess solvent. This entire process, including spin-coating and drying, was repeated 3 times.
2.5 Fabrication of superhydrophobic coating with top modified superhydrophobic SiO2 precursor solution
The glass-deposited SiO2 layer and coated middle connecting layer were dripped with the modified superhydrophobic SiO2 precursor solution by spin-coating at 400 rpm for 6 s, then at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and dried in an oven at 120 °C for 30 min in an air atmosphere to remove the excess solvent. This entire process, including spin-coating and drying, was repeated three times.
2.6 Characterization
The static water contact angles of the superhydrophobic surfaces obtained through the above procedures were measured via the sessile drop technique using a KRUSS DSA100 (Shanghai Xuan Yi Chong Industrial Equipment Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China) contact angle system, with DI water drops of approximately 5 μL applied to five different spots for each coating. The surface morphology of the superhydrophobic surfaces was observed via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (JEOL SEM JSM-6510LV) at an operating voltage of 15 kV. To improve the conductivity, a thin layer of platinum was sputtered onto the superhydrophobic surfaces. The ultraviolet (UV)-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of the superhydrophobic surfaces were measured with a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at normal incidence. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were collected using a Park Systems XE-100 (Suwon, Korea) operating in non-contact mode. Functional groups were characterized using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR, Vertex 70, Bruker). The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were evaluated under simulated AM 1.5G radiation (100 mW cm−2 irradiance) using a solar simulator (Oriel, model 91192-1000) and a source meter (Keithley 2400, USA).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Reaction mechanism of the superhydrophobic coating
To explore the reasons for the excellent weatherability of the as-prepared superhydrophobic surface, the whole experimental design and the intermediate reaction mechanism are discussed. We analyze it from a design point of view. Firstly, the construction of a superhydrophobic surface should satisfy the requirement of a rough structure and low surface energy. Secondly, one of the main difficulties facing superhydrophobic surfaces is poor mechanical durability. Especially, for transparent superhydrophobic surfaces, achieving mechanical durability is very difficult. This is one of the main reasons hindering the application of superhydrophobic surfaces in real life and industry. Thus, to obtain higher mechanical durability, the rough structures should be strong and durable, and the low surface energy materials should also be durable. From the point of view of chemical bonds, only when stable chemical bonds are formed, chemical reactions occur and new chemical bonds are realized, stronger durability can be realized. Therefore, we propose a new method: (1) covalent bonds are formed between the transmission middle connecting layer and the substrate with a large number of active hydroxyl groups on its surface. The 3D network structure of the middle connecting layer wraps and fixes hydrophobic silica particles to form a rough micro-structure, which improves the durability of the coating. (2) Silicon hydroxyl and silicone methyl bipolar silicon nanoparticles are prepared on the middle layer. The covalent bond formed by the polar Si-hydroxyl groups closely connects the top layer to the middle layer. The nonpolar silicone methyl groups on the surface have very low surface energy, together with micro- and nano-structures, which can make the surface superhydrophobic. A schematic presentation of the fabrication of the superhydrophobic coating is shown in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Schematic showing the preparation of the superhydrophobic coating. 
SiO2 nano-films with a large amount of active hydroxyl groups were prepared on glass substrates via the PECVD method, as shown in Scheme 1a. Scheme 1b shows the formation of covalent bonds between the substrate and the middle connecting layer. KH-560 was chosen as the middle connecting layer because of its strong optical properties and good adhesion to the matrix. Firstly, KH-560 was hydrolyzed in methanol and three Si–OCH3 groups were converted into three Si–OH groups. The newly formed Si–OH group reacted with the –OH group on the surface of the underlying SiO2 under heat treatment, forming an Si–O–Si covalent bond. The connection between the glass substrate and the intermediate connecting layer was strengthened. Scheme 1c shows the preparation of the top superhydrophobic silica. After the hydrolysis of TEOS, four Si–OC2H5 groups linked by Si were converted into four Si–OH groups. The hydroxyl groups on the surface of silica were modified by HMDS with low surface energy –CH3 to prepare superhydrophobic SiO2. The intermediate connecting layer and the top superhydrophobic SiO2 were stably bonded by covalent bond formation. Some hydroxyl groups on the surface of the modified superhydrophobic SiO2 reacted with the hydroxyl groups formed by the ring opening reaction of KH560 and ODA to form Si–O–C chemical bonds. This is precise because each layer is connected by forming new chemical bonds, and thus the superhydrophobic coating with a multi-layer composite structure has strong mechanical stability. To verify the formation of covalent bonds in the preparation process, the FTIR spectra of the modified superhydrophobic silica particles, the middle layer and the top superhydrophobic surface are displayed in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1a shows the infrared spectra of the hydrophilic silica nanoparticles modified by HMDS. It can be observed that the characteristic peaks of –CH3 appear at around 1389 cm−1, and that for Si–C are found at around 820 cm−1. These characteristic peaks are attributed to HMDS, which indicates that HMDS reacted successfully with some of the –OH groups on the surface of the hydrophilic SiO2.15 Meanwhile, we only needed to determine whether the covalent bond of Si–O–Si was formed to accurately confirm the chemical reaction between the bottom silica and the intermediate layer. The surface covered by the middle connecting solution was cured at 90 °C for 20 min. Next, the coated surface with the middle connecting layer was dropped with the modified nano-silica solution. Then, the sample was kept at 120 °C for 30 min. After the curing process, the intermediate layer was formed. In Fig. 1b, the obvious characteristic peak of Si–O–Si is observed at 1150 cm−1, which indicates the formation of covalent bonds between the glass bottom layer and the intermediate junction layer. This is the fundamental reason why the middle and bottom layers have excellent mechanical wear resistance. Further, to verify the formation of covalent bonds between the middle layer and the top bipolar layer during the preparation process, Fig. 1c shows the FTIR spectra of the top bipolar solution and the top bipolar layer. When the upper bipolar solution was coated on the middle layer, the residual-OH groups on the surface of bipolar silicon reacted with the –OH formed by the hydrolytic ring-opening of the intermediate layer KH560 to form the Si–O–C bond. In Fig. 1c, the characteristic peak of –CH3 appears near 2957 cm−1, while the peak of Si–CH3 appears near 840 cm−1.16,17 The characteristic peak of –OH is also found near 3400 cm−1. These peaks indicate that the chemical reaction between the middle layer and the residual –OH groups on the top silica surface occurred, which resulted in the formation of covalent bonds, thus enhancing the mechanical wear resistance of the top and middle layers.
3.2 The wettability property of the superhydrophobic coating
The wettability of the obtained surfaces was measured using an OCA2.0 contact angle measurement system at room temperature with 5 mL water droplets. When the water droplet was dropped on the surface of the bare glass with an SiO2 layer, it exhibited excellent wettability and its contact angle (WCA = 0°) was lower than that (WCA = 15°) of the bare glass without the SiO2 layer, as shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The contact angle of the hydrophilic middle connecting layer was 80°, as shown in Fig. 2c. However, the top layer displayed excellent superhydrophobicity, and its contact angle was 153°. To further explore the cause of this phenomenon, we conducted further tests on the bare glass and SiO2 layer. We dynamically studied the relation between the static water contact angle and time that the water droplets remained on their surfaces, as shown in Fig. 2e and f, respectively. As can be seen, the wettability of the bare glass was relatively stable. When the droplets contacted with the surface of the glass, they spread rapidly, showing good wettability (WCA = 21°), and after 7.9 s, the change in the water contact angle was very small, still showing good wettability (WCA = 15°). However, the opposite results were observed on the surface of the glass deposited with the SiO2 film. When the water drop touched the surface, the water drop instantly spread out, and the time for whole process was quite short, only 0.33 s. This indicates that the SiO2 layer had more the hydroxyl groups than the bare glass. Meanwhile, we also conducted AFM tests on both surfaces, as shown in Fig. 2g and h, respectively. The bare glass surface was very smooth with a surface roughness of only 0.554 nm. However, after the SiO2 layer was deposited, the surface became obviously rough, with a surface roughness of 5.806 nm. For a hydrophilic surface, with an increase in surface roughness, its hydrophilicity improves, which is completely consistent with the original reported theory.18–20 This was important for covalent bonds to be formed between the glass substrate and the middle connecting layer.

3.3 The optical transmittance and self-cleaning properties of the superhydrophobic coating
The optical transmittance of the obtained superhydrophobic coating was measured. As shown in Fig. 3, the transmission of the bare glass was about 97% in the visible light range from 300–780 nm. When the middle layer was coated on the glass, the transmission decreased to 95%. However, even with the superhydrophobic coating, the transmission still reached up to 94%, which was 97% for the bare. Thus, the transparent superhydrophobic coating meets most of the requirements for practical applications. Alternative surfaces that clean themselves by water flow are known as self-cleaning surfaces. Especially on superhydrophobic surfaces, accumulated dust particles can be easily washed away by rolling water droplets. The superhydrophobic coating also showed an excellent self-cleaning performance, as verified experimentally. As shown in Fig. 3a, the substrate was placed at the top by about 30° relative to the horizontal line, and its self-cleaning performance for methylene blue was studied. Water droplets were poured on the bare and coated surface to test the self-cleaning performance of the superhydrophobic coating in the removal of a simulated pollutant (Fig. 3a and b, respectively). When the water droplets came into contact with the methylene blue powder on the coated surface, they rolled down and removed the methylene blue powder. After the water injection process, the droplets completely removed the pollutant, leaving a clean surface (Fig. 3d). Next, we observed the transparency and superhydrophobicity of the superhydrophobic coating simultaneously (Fig. 3e). It was observed that many spherical water droplets were randomly distributed on a large area of the superhydrophobic transparent coating (about 2.5 × 2.5 cm2), which further indicates that it has good superhydrophobicity. Simultaneously, the pattern under the coating substrate could be clearly seen, which further indicates that the coating has high transmission. The transmittance usually increases with a decrease in surface roughness,21,22 which is predicted by the optical theory for multilayer coatings.23,24

3.4 The chemical durability and weatherability properties of the superhydrophobic coating
For practical applications, superhydrophobic materials are urgently required to retain their inherent performances under different extreme conditions.25 Thus, we evaluated the chemical durability of the superhydrophobic coating using common liquids such as water, milk, cola, malachite green, methylene blue, water with pH = 2, and water with pH = 12, as shown in Fig. 4a. It was observed that all the droplets of the different liquids used in daily life maintained a spherical shape on the surface of the superhydrophobic coating, indicating the tolerance of the superhydrophobic coating to these liquids. The water contact angle was 153° and sliding angle about 4°, as shown in Fig. 4b. Specially, we also evaluated 1 mol L−1 NaOH (Fig. 4c) and 1 mol L−1 HNO3 (Fig. 4d) droplets on the superhydrophobic coating surface absorbed by pH test paper. Both droplets displayed a perfect spherical for a long time on the paper. Also both of them were absorbed quickly by the pH test paper without residual drops, indicating the low adhesion of the superhydrophobic coating.

(b) WCA and SA of the superhydrophobic glass. (c) 1 mol L−1 NaOH and (d) 1 mol L−1 HNO3 droplets on the superhydrophobic glass surface absorbed by pH test paper. 
The application of superhydrophobic coatings was considered in extreme weather such as rainstorms and sandstorms. Superhydrophobic coatings should have strong water impact resistance, sand impact resistance, and thermal stability in different outdoor environments, which are issues that cannot be ignored.26,27 Due to the poor mechanical stability of superhydrophobic films with high roughness, their carefully designed microstructures are easily damaged. In the literature, waterfall and sand wear tests are usually used to study the mechanical stability of superhydrophobic films.28–31 Thus, as shown in Fig. 5a, we performed a water impact test on the superhydrophobic coating. The surface was prepared by continuous impingement of water at a speed of 1 mL s−1 from a height of 15 cm (Fig. 5a). The superhydrophobic coating surface exhibited excellent stability after impact of 20 L flow without losing its high hydrophobicity and transparency. A sand abrasive test was also performed to determine the sand impact resistance of the superhydrophobic coating. The optimal glass surface was impacted by sand flow with a velocity of about 10 g min−1 from a height of 15 cm (inset of Fig. 5b). The size of the sand varied from 100 μm to 300 μm, and the impact time was counted from 30 s to 300 s. Fig. 5b indicates that after 5 min of sand abrasion test, the SCA was maintained at greater than 150°. Further, we tested the thermal stability of the superhydrophobic coating at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 5c. After heating the superhydrophobic coating at 0 °C, 100 °C, 200 °C and 400 °C for 1 h, we tested its static water contact angle and found that there was little change and it remained above 150°. This indicates that our prepared superhydrophobic coating has very good thermal stability. Simultaneously, as shown in Fig. 5d, the superhydrophobic coating maintained excellent superhydrophobicity after being placed in 10 wt% NaCl solution for 48 h. The superhydrophobic coating still maintained its good superhydrophobicity after long time testing under different harsh conditions, which provides a great possibility it to be used outdoors as a solar shield for a long time.

(b) Changes in CA after each impinge of sand, inset is a schematic diagram of the setup for sand impact test, and height h = 15 cm. (c) Water contact angle after treatment at different temperatures. (d) Water contact angle after soaking for different times. 
3.5 The morphological of the superhydrophobic coating
To observe the morphology of each layer in this three-layer superhydrophobic coating, we obtained high-power scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images. Fig. 6 shows the SEM images and AFM images of the top superhydrophobic layer, the middle connecting layer, and the bottom SiO2 layer. As shown in Fig. 6a, it can be clearly observed that the prepared superhydrophobic surface is a porous structure film formed by the aggregation of a large number of spherical particles with a diameter of 20–30 nm. The surface roughness of the porous film on superhydrophobic surface is 56.65 nm (Fig. 6d). According to the literature,32,33 the roughness is closely related to the transmittance and wettability of coatings. On the one hand, it is known that there is a competitive relationship between roughness and transmittance. If the roughness is too large, the transmittance will be reduced. On the other hand, when the surface water contact angle is greater than 90°, the surface water contact angle will increase with the roughness. Consequently, our superhydrophobic layer can maintain excellent superhydrophobicity as well as high transmittance. Fig. 6b shows the top surface of the hydrophilic middle connecting layer without the top coating. It is obvious that a 3D-network structure is formed in the middle layer, which plays an important role in improving the mechanical durability of the coating. This enhanced the robustness of the rough structures with a surface roughness of 15.3 nm (Fig. 6e). Also, this issue will be discussed in detail from the point of view of reaction mechanism. As can be observed from Fig. 6c, the bottom layer is formed by layer-to-layer deposition, and the SiO2 thin films prepared by PECVD are stacked and spread by nanoparticles. After the SiO2 layer was deposited on the surface, the surface became obviously rough, with a surface roughness of 5.806 nm, which was discussed in the previous wettability section.

3.7 Application of the superhydrophobic coating
To evaluate the feasibility and superiority of optical transparent superhydrophobic glass substrates as cover glass in solar cells, glass with the superhydrophobic film and bare packaging glass were placed outdoors simultaneously (12 days per cycle). After simple water cleaning, the two types of glass were placed above a solar cell and its photovoltaic properties were measured. Fig. 7a shows the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curve of the solar cell (C1) with the bare packaging glass as its cover glass and the related parameters of the battery are shown in Table 1. In addition, it should be noted that we measured the efficiency of each battery five times and selected the result closest to the median value. The error in the measurements of the efficiency is ±0.06%. It is obvious from Fig. 7a and b that the efficiency of the solar cell as a battery cover decreased sharply when the ordinary packaging glass was washed simply after being polluted by particulate dust outdoors. After two months, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of C1 was reduced to 21.00% (Table 1). The reason for this may be due to the presence of dust on the cover glass, which obscured the light path towards the solar panel and correspondingly reduced the short circuit current density (Jsc), eventually reducing the power conversion efficiency. This indicates that dust particles play an important role in reducing the efficiency of solar panels. When the solar cell (C2) was covered by the superhydrophobic glass substrate, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cell decreased, but the decline was relatively gentle.

After two months, the PCE of the solar cell decreased by only 14.81%, as shown in Table 2. Compared with the PCE of C1, C2 significantly alleviated the decline in cell efficiency, which will be of great significance for the long-term outdoor use of solar cells. Fig. 7c compares the PCE of C1 and C2 during a period of two months. Obviously, the PCE of the two types of batteries was reduced because of dust after storage outdoors, but the reduction in the PCE of the batteries using the superhydrophobic glass cover was small. Initially, the PCE of C1 was higher than that of C2. After 12 days, the PCE of C2 was significantly higher than that of C1. The efficiency of C1 was only 13.01% after 60 days of testing, which was significantly lower than that of C2 (14.21%). The inset in Fig. 7d shows the samples (C2 on the left and C1 on the right), and it can be seen that the surface of C2 is obviously cleaner than that of C1. Fig. 7d shows the change in the water contact angle of the superhydrophobic coating after 60 days. According to Fig. 7d, the superhydrophobic coating still retained excellent superhydrophobicity (water contact angle was 140°) after 60 days of staying outdoors, which is why C2 maintained its high PCE. It must be noted that the short circuit current (Jsc) decreases significantly when the open circuit voltage (Voc) changes slightly. Thus, it can be inferred that dust accumulation plays an important role in reducing the PCE of solar cells.34,35 Of course, there are still many problems worth studying. To study how the thickness and transmittance of each layer affect the efficiency of solar panels, we will continue to study and discuss these issues in our future work. In conclusion, the self-cleaning superhydrophobic solar panel cover glass has great prospects.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we designed and prepared a superhydrophobic coating with high transmittance and excellent weather resistance for the glass covers of solar cells. The design of the three-layer structure gives the film strong chemical and mechanical stability. The superhydrophobic coating exhibited obvious stability against strong acid, strong alkali, water droplets and sand impact. Furthermore, the superhydrophobic coating has excellent superhydrophobic and self-cleaning properties, and its static water contact angle is 153°. Meanwhile, the superhydrophobic coating exhibited good thermal stability. The effect of the superhydrophobic glass and bare glass as glass covers of a solar cell on its efficiency was tested outdoors. Two months later, the efficiency of the superhydrophobic glass-covered solar cells was 14.21%. However, the efficiency of the solar cell with the bare glass cover decreased dramatically, with the efficiency being only 13.01%. This provides a practical basis for the feasibility of optical transparent superhydrophobic self-cleaning glass substrates as solar cell cover glass.
