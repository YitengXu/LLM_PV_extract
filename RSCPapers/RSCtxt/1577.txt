    , Accepted 23rd April 2021First published on 24th April 2021AbstractIn recent years, two-dimensional (2D) lead-free double perovskites have been attracting much attention because of their unique performance in photovoltaic solar cells and photocatalysis. Nonetheless, how thickness affects the photoelectric properties of lead-free double perovskite remains unclear. In this work, by means of density functional theory (DFT) with a spin orbit coupling (SOC) effect, we have investigated the electronic and optical properties systemically, including band structures, carrier mobility, optical absorption spectra, exciton-binding energies, band edges alignment and molecule adsorption performance of Cs2AgBiBr6 with different thicknesses. The calculated results revealed the thickness-induced band gap and optical performance for Cs2AgBiBr6. It shows a low band gap and outstanding optical absorption of visible and ultraviolet light. When the thickness is reduced to a monolayer, Cs2AgBiBr6 moves from an indirect band gap to a direct band gap. Moreover, the carrier mobility of Cs2AgBiBr6 is excellent and the exciton-binding energy increases with the decreased thickness. Importantly, an analysis of molecule adsorption and band edge alignment indicates that Cs2AgBiBr6 is prone to H2O adsorption and H2 desorption theoretically, which is conducive to the photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen generation and other photovatalytic reactions. Our work suggests that Cs2AgBiBr6 is a potential candidate as a solar cell or a photocatalyst, and we provide theoretical explorations into reducing the layers of lead-free double perovskite materials to 2D atomic thickness for a better photocatalytic application, which can serve as guidelines for the design of excellent photocatalysts.
1. Introduction
The past few years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of people who pay attention to energy and environmental crises. Solar power, as an environment-friendly and renewable source, has been employed in a great number of fields.1–4 In this aspect, photocatalysis is one of the most promising strategies to reduce energy waste and ecological damage. As the key component of photocatalysis, photocatalysts play an extremely important role in the overall performance.5,6 In the past decades, various semiconductor materials such as titanium dioxide, tungsten trioxide and carbon nitrides have been used for photocatalysis.7–10 However, most photocatalysts have wide band gaps and are active only under ultraviolet light irradiation. Furthermore, they have low mobility and a high recombination rate of electron–hole pairs. Hence, it is important and significant to search for a new efficient photocatalyst.
In recent years, not only have halide perovskites made a lot of breakthroughs in the photovoltaic field, but they have also been put into use as photocatalysts, showing a huge solar energy conversion potential.11–13 For example, lead-based perovskites CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have been applied to various photocatalytic reactions such as degradation of pollutants, hydrogen generation, carbon dioxide conversion and organic synthesis.14–20 Nevertheless, there are concerns about the possible environmental impact because CsPbX3 perovskites contain lead. In addition, lead-based halide perovskites are known to degrade rapidly when exposed to ambient conditions. Therefore, the search for environment-friendly and stable halide perovskites is an active research area. So far, there have been many investigations into transportation from CsPbX3 to Cs2MM′X6 (M = Ag, M′ = Sb, In, Bi, X = Cl, Br, I) lead-free double perovskites.21–25 Among these materials, the band gap of the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is too large to take advantage of efficient sunlight absorption.26 Cs2AgBiI6 is not stable.27 Comparatively speaking, the Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite has been prepared successfully and is regarded as a promising material because of its suitable band gap (1.95 eV).23 According to Thomas Bein et al., Cs2AgBiBr6 film could serve as the first lead-free double perovskite solar cell, which showed power conversion efficiencies close to 2.5%.28 Xu et al. reported that the reaction rate for dye degradation on double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 was comparable to that on CdS.29 Kuang et al. applied Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite nanocrystals in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, achieving the evolution of CO and CH4 of 14.1 and 9.6 μmol g−1 after constant irradiation for 6 h.30 Furthermore, Karunadasa et al. reported that dimensional reduction of Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite could afford dramatic changes in the physical and electronic properties.31 However, there is lack of theoretical investigation and analysis on the electronic and optical properties of double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6. In addition, it is intriguing to explore the intrinsic nature and redox properties of Cs2AgBiBr6 as a photocatalyst.
In this work, we focus on the novel 2D layered lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6. The geometric, electronic, optical and photocatalytic properties of double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 with different layers were investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. First, we systematically analyzed the lattice constants, band structures and density of states on the basis of optimized structures. Then, the charge carrier mobilities and relaxation time τ of 2D layered Cs2AgBiBr6 were quantitatively discussed with the variation of the number of layers. Finally, we analyzed the exciton binding energies, optical absorption coefficients, band edge alignment and molecule adsorption performance. In a word, the calculated results show that the energy band of Cs2AgBiBr6 would transform from the direct band gap to the indirect band gap with the reducing thickness to monolayer. In addition, the results predicted excellent photoelectronic properties of 2D layered Cs2AgBiBr6, which could provide a theoretical basis for the development of 2D layered lead-free double perovskites as photocatalysts.
2. Computational methods
2.1 DFT calculations
We used the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation package (VASP) code to perform the calculations, which implemented the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method to consider the interaction between valence electrons and ion cores.32–47 The valence electron configurations of Cs (6s1), Bi (6s26p3), Ag (4d105s1) and Br (4s24p5) have been considered. The exchange and correlation potential was described by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional while the van der Waals (vdW) interaction was taken into account by the DFT-D3 method of Grimme.48–51 The cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis set was 400 eV in all calculations. A gamma-centered k-point grid of 5 × 5 × 1 using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme was used for geometry optimization. The structures and atomic positions were fully relaxed until the energy changes and forces on each atom were less than 1.0 × 10−5 eV and 0.05 eV Å−1, respectively. The vacuum space along the c-direction was set to be at least 20 Å to remove the interaction between neighboring layers. Considering that the GGA potential usually underestimated the band gap because of the self-correlation error of electrons, the HSE06 functional was adopted for the calculation of the electronic structures. The spin orbit coupling (SOC) was also considered.
2.2 Surface energy calculation
The surface energy Esurf that describes the stability of a surface, is the energy required to cleave a surface from a bulk crystal. It is given by the following formula:52 (1)Here, A is the area of the surface considered; Erelaxs and Eunrelaxs are the energies of the relaxed and unrelaxed surfaces, respectively; N is the number of atoms in the slab and Ebulk is the bulk energy per atom.
2.3 Carrier mobility calculation
For 2D materials, we adopt a simple approach to calculate the carrier mobility on the basis of the deformation potential (DP) theory proposed by Bardeen and Shockley with the following equations:53–55 (2)KB, e and ℏ are the Boltzmann constant, element charge and the reduced Planck constant, respectively. The temperature T used in our calculations is 300 K.
The elastic modulus C2D concerned with the acoustic phonon in the propagation directions (both a and b directions) is defined as (3)where E is the total energy and S0 is the area of the cell. Besides, δ is the applied uniaxial train.
The E1 represents the DP constant, which is defined by the following form: (4)where ∂Eedg represents the energy shift of the valence band maximum (VBM) for holes or the conduction band minimum (CBM) for electrons along the transport direction induced by the strain ∂δ.
The m* is the effective mass in-plane derived from the following expression: (5)where ℏ, k and ε(k) represent the Planck constant, the wave vector and eigenvalues of energy band, respectively.
The relaxation time is calculated by the following equation: (6)
2.4 Exciton binding energy calculation
According to the Wannier exciton model, the exciton binding energy (Eb) is estimated by the following formula:56 (7)where the  is a reduced effective mass replacing a reduced mass of the hydrogen atom  and ε∞ is static dielectric constant, which can be evaluated by density functional perturbation theory.57 The value of n represents the exciton energy level. When n equals one, it indicates the exciton ground state energy.
2.5 Optical propertycalculations
The absorption coefficient α(ω) is expressed by the following equation:58 (8)where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively, which depend on the optical frequency (ω).
2.6 Adsorption energy calculation
Adsorption energy (Ea) for each site is calculated using the relation given by59 (9)where Emolecule-Cs2AgBiBr6 is the total energy of the molecule–Cs2AgBiBr6 adsorption system; Emolecule is the total energy of an isolated molecule; and ECs2AgBiBr6 is the total energy of Cs2AgBiBr6.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric structure
Firstly, based on experimental data, we investigated the geometric structure of bulk Cs2AgBiBr6 which belonged to a faced-centered cubic Fmm space group. By adding a proper vacuum to bulk Cs2AgBiBr6 along the c axis to avoid the interaction from neighboring slabs, the monolayer and multilayer double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 were modeled. For the convenience of calculations, we only built Cs2AgBiBr6 models with one layer (1L) to five layers (5L). The structural configurations of 2D lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 are shown in Fig. 1, where Ag+ and Bi3+ ions located on the B and B′ sites are bonded with Br− to form two types of regular octahedra. These two octahedra alternately link into a face-centered cubic structure, with Cs+ filling into their gaps, forming a typical A2BB′X6 double perovskite structure. It is worth mentioning that when bulk Cs2AgBiBr6 is exfoliated into a monolayer, the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer has two possible structures with different surface-exposed atoms, namely, surface termination A (STA) and surface termination B (STB), as presented in Fig. 2. According to our calculations from eqn (1), the surface energy of STB (0.083 J m−2) is lower than that of STA (0.415 J m−2). Hence STB is the energetically better favored termination type for Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite. Our result is consistent with the report of G. Volonakis et al.60 The specific calculated lattice parameters of Cs2AgBiBr6 with different thicknesses are presented in Table 1. As the number of layers increases, the optimized lattice constants gradually increase from 1L (a = b = 7.976 Å) to 5L (a = b = 8.037 Å).

3.2 Band alignment and electronic properties
The calculated band structures of monolayer Cs2AgBiBr6 using the PBE, PBE+SOC and HSE+SOC functionals are shown in Fig. 3. The high symmetry k-point path in the first Brillouin zone is set to L(0.5, 0.5, 0.5) → Γ(0, 0, 0) → X(0.5, 0, 0.5) → L(0.5, 0.5, 0.5). In Fig. 3a, the band gap of the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer using the PBE functional is 2.02 eV. It shows an indirect band gap. That is to say, valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are located at different points. Due to the effect on the dispersity of the band structures of the heavy metal element Bi, SOC should be considered. The band structure calculated by PBE+SOC (in Fig. 3b) indicated that the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer is a semiconductor with a direct band gap (1.53 eV) for both VBM and CBM located at the Γ point. However, neither PBE nor PBE+SOC can obtain accurate band gaps. The most accurate band gap can be obtained by eliminating the errors of the standard DFT band gap calculations and the overestimation caused by the SOC effect in heavy elements such as bismuth. Therefore, we calculated the band structure using the HSE06 functional with the SOC effect. As shown in Fig. 3c, the band gap calculated by HSE+SOC of the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer is 2.39 eV, which is in accordance with the reported data (the direct band gap of 2.20 eV at the Γ point).31 Compared with the PBE method, the inclusion of SOC has a profound effect on the structures of conduction bands. Without SOC, the CBM of the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer lies at the X point. However, with the inclusion of SOC, the result is that the CBM of the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer moves from the X point to Γ point. Thus, the direct band gap of Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer at the Γ point is a consequence of its structure. The band structures of two to five layers of the double peroskite Cs2AgBiBr6 calculated by PBE, PBE+SOC and HSE+SOC methods are presented in Fig. 4. The specific band gap values of multilayer Cs2AgBiBr6 peroskite are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). According to Fig. 4, band structures of double peroskite Cs2AgBiBr6 from 2L to 5L show an indirect band gap and VBM at the L point and CBM at the X point. Unlike the single layer, the SOC effect does not change the band structure type from the indirect band gap to the direct band gap. The band gaps with the PBE+SOC functional from 2L to 5L are 1.53, 1.31, 1.28 and 1.22 eV, respectively. The values using the HSE+SOC functional from 2L to 5L are 2.36, 2.11, 2.09 and 2.04 eV, respectively. The values of band gap decrease with the increase of layers, which indicates that the band gap could be tuned by varying layer thickness. Besides, Fig. 4 and Table S1 (ESI†) demonstrate that the band structure shape using the PBE+SOC method is the same as that using HSE+SOC. Since HSE+SOC calculations are complex and expensive and the effective masses are only related to the dispersity around the VBM and CBM, the PBE+SOC method is used to estimate the effective masses.

In order to better illustrate the band compositions of double peroskite Cs2AgBiBr6, the partial density of states (PDOS) is performed. As shown in Fig. 5, the PDOS of the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer is calculated by PBE and PBE+SOC methods. As for the two methods, the VBM of the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer is mainly occupied by the Ag 4d and Br 4p orbitals, whereas the CBM consists of Bi 6p and Br 4p orbitals. Both the VBM and CBM receive little contribution from the Cs+ cation as the Cs atoms mainly serve as support structures. As for the PDOS of Cs2AgBiBr6 multilayers (in Fig. S1, ESI†), the VBM is also primary occupied by Ag 4d and Br 4p orbitals and the CBM is also made up of Bi 6p and Br 4p orbitals. Based on these results, it is recognized that the photo-generated electrons move from Ag to Bi.

Furthermore, the charge carrier mobility is one of the most important properties of different layers Cs2AgBiBr6. According to eqn (2), we can predict the charge carrier mobility of 2D layered double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6. The energy–strain relationship along the a and b directions for the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer is presented in Fig. 6a, which defines elastic modulus C2D with parabola fittings according to eqn (3). On the basis of eqn (4), Fig. 6b and c present shifts of the energy of band edges for CBM and VBM of the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer under uniaxial strain along the a and b directions. Its slope is the DP constant E1. Following the same method, the corresponding DP constant E1 and the stretching modulus C2D of multilayers Cs2AgBiBr6 are also obtained. It should be stated here that E1 and C2D are calculated using PBE+SOC functional, because parameters related to E1 and C2D can be affected by SOC.

Shifts of conduction band minimum and valence band maximum of Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer under uniaxial strain (b) along a direction and (c) along b direction. Solid lines represent the linear fit, which define DP constants. 
As shown in Fig. 7a, the value of the stretching modulus C2D presents a positive correlation with the number of layers. The stretching modulus C2D increases from 113.42 N m−1 to 403.88 N m−1 when the thicknesses of layers vary from monolayer to five layers of Cs2AgBiBr6, which can promote the transport properties. The values in the b direction are nearly the same as those in the a direction because the structures of Cs2AgBiBr6 have good symmetry (lattice constant a = b). Fig. 7b shows that the DP constant E1 varied by increasing the thickness of layered perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6. It is clear that the DP constant E1 of holes is larger than that of electrons for Cs2AgBiBr6 multilayers, while the DP constant E1 of holes is smaller than that of electrons for the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer. Why does the DP constant of electrons for Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer become large? The reason is likely that the CBM moves from the X point to the Γ point and the band energy level of CBM changes more steeply for the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer with SOC. Besides, the average DP constant E1 for electrons and holes increases with the thicknesses changing from 2L to 5L (4.64–6.55 eV for electrons and 6.30–7.64 eV for holes).
 Fig. 7  (a) Calculated the elastic modulus C2D and (b) average DP constants along a direction and b direction with the increase of layers for the halide double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6. 
Similarly, considering the SOC effect, the effective mass m* can be calculated by eqn (5). We can see that the effective mass of Cs2AgBiBr6 shows an order  according to Fig. 8a. Besides, the effective mass presents a negative correlation with the number of layers. It is known that the smaller the effective mass, the faster the migration of charge carriers. Thus, the holes have better mobility properties than electrons. On the basis of the calculated stretching modulus, DP constant and effective mass, Fig. 8b shows the carrier mobility of Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite with different thicknesses and Table 2 lists the specific values. Because of the specificity of monolayer Cs2AgBiBr6 with the direct band gap, the carrier mobility of monolayer Cs2AgBiBr6 for holes is 204.94 cm2 V−1 s−1. But the carrier mobility of monolayer Cs2AgBiBr6 for electrons is still slow and needs to be improved. As for Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite with different layers, there is an order . The carrier mobility enlarges from 76.54 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 176.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons while from 91.83 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 189.19 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes with the increase of layers from two layers to five layers. As is well-known, CsPbI3 (ca. 25 cm2 V−1 s−1) and MoS2 (ca. 150 cm2 V−1 s−1) are excellent photovoltaic materials.61–63 The 2D layered lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 can be considered as an excellent photo-electronic material because of good charge transport properties. Besides, the relaxation time τ can be calculated by eqn (6), showing how quickly the electrons and holes return to the equilibrium distribution.

3.3 The exciton binding energy and optical properties
It is said that the exciton binding energy (Eb) has a direct influence on the diffusion length and electron–hole pair recombination rate. According to eqn (7), Table 3 shows the calculated Eb of the ground state (n = 1) for the 2D layered perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6. The exciton binding energy of Cs2AgBiBr6 decreases from 2382 meV to 681 meV with the increase of layers from 1L to 3L. The result shows a strong thickness-dependent quantum confinement. It should be pointed out that the dielectric constant of Cs2AgBiBr6 is simply evaluated by the PBE method because of limited computing resources, resulting in underestimation of the dielectric constant and overestimation of the exciton binding energy. Compared with the calculated value of CsPbI3 (104.17 meV), the exciton binding energies of Cs2AgBiBr6 with different layers are larger, especially for the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer.64 It means that the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer shows excellent photoluminescence properties. However, if used as a photocatalyst, the exciton binding energy of Cs2AgBiBr6 should be reduced to lower the recombination rate of photo-generated electron and hole pairs.

In addition, following eqn (8), we predicate the optical absorption spectra of Cs2AgBiBr6 with different layers to investigate their optical properties in Fig. 9. Cs2AgBiBr6 with different layers has excellent optical absorption within the visible light region from 1.6 eV to 3.1 eV. Overall, for visible light absorption intensity, the order of the materials is bulk > 5L > 4L > 3L > 2L > 1L. Compared with other layers, the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer shows a red shift phenomenon. These results suggested that the light absorption of Cs2AgBiBr6 could be adjusted by changing the number of layers.

3.4 Band edge alignment and molecule adsorption
Whether the electrons and holes transferred to surfaces can participate in oxidation and reduction reactions is dependent on the positions of the band edges. It is known that overall water splitting is still a challenge at present. The CBM and VBM of the photocatalyst must extend over the water reduction level (VH+/H2 = −4.44 eV) and the water oxidation level (VO2/H2O = −5.67 eV). To illustrate the redox ability of Cs2AgBiBr6, we studied the band edge alignment using the HSE+SOC method (in Fig. 10). From Fig. 10, it could be seen that from 2L to 3L, the VBM shifted upward and the CBM moved downward gradually. Besides, from 3L to 5L, VBM and CBM show little change. The different changes of CBM and VBM were observed in 1L due to the large lattice and structure relaxation and the spin orbit coupling effect. Compared with 2L, 1L revealed significantly large upward shift of the band edges for both VBM and CBM, which corresponded to an enhancement of the reduction capacity and a further reduction in the originally inadequate oxidation power. Therefore, an improved photo-reduction reaction may be achieved by reducing Cs2AgBiBr6 to monolayer thickness. Moreover, the visible-light-driven H2 production from H2O was theoretically observed in Cs2AgBiBr6 with different layers. Meanwhile, although the lower VBM position in 2L compared to that in 1L indicated that the oxidation capacity was improved, the enhanced oxidation power was still inferior to the water oxidation level. However, Cs2AgBiBr6 has an appropriate oxidation potential for other photocatalytic oxidation reactions such as dye degradation.29

It is well-known that 2D layered Cs2AgBiBr6 shows huge specific surface areas and many active sites, which gives it excellent catalytic properties. So far, many efforts have been made to achieve adsorption performance for photocatalytic reactions. For example, Zhang et al. investigated the influence of the adsorption of molecules (H2O and H2) on the photocatalytic performance.65,66 They found that the MoS2/CdS(100) has an excellent capacity of H2O absorption compared with MoS2/CdS(001). Inspired by their studies, we evaluate the stability of adsorption of molecules (H2O and H2) on Cs2AgBiBr6 with different layers based on the calculation of adsorption energy according to the eqn (9). The 2 × 2 × 1 supercell of Cs2AgBiBr6 is used in our calculations. We consider three types of high-symmetry sites for molecule adsorption, as shown in Fig. 11: (1) the Hollow sites including Site 1 and Site 2, (2) the Bridge sites including Site 3 and Site 4, above the middle-point of the Bi–Br bond and Ag–Br bond, respectively, (3) the On-top sites including four sites, from Site 5 to Site 7 on the top of the Br atom and Site 8 on the top of Cs atom. To find the equilibrium adsorption structure, we initially put molecules at each adsorption site, and then relax all the atoms in the system. From our definition, the negative value of Ea shows that a given adsorption structure is stable. The large absolute value of Ea means strong interactions between the molecule and Cs2AgBiBr6. The adsorption site with the most negative adsorption energy is referred to as the most favorable one. We obtain some stable adsorption structures shown in Fig. 12 and the corresponding adsorption energies (Ea) are summarized in Table 4. As shown in the Table 4, the average value (Ea) for H2 adsorption on the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer is close to zero (ca. −0.05 eV), which shows the weak interaction between H2 and Cs2AgBiBr6. In other words, it is easier for H2 desorption. The most stable site of H2 adsorption is Site 2 (−0.07 eV in Fig. 12a). What's more, we observe that the average adsorption energy of H2O adsorption on Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer is ca. −0.25 eV, revealing that Cs2AgBiBr6 has priority for H2O adsorption. The H2O adsorption on the Cs2AgBiBr6 is considered using two different adsorption orientation models including H atom downwards (Fig. 12b) and H atom upwards (Fig. 12c). The three most stable sites of H2O adsorption are Site 6 (−0.51 eV), Site 2 (−0.34 eV) and Site 1 (−0.27 eV). It should be pointed out that H2O adsorption at Site 8 tends to H atom upwards, while H2O adsorption from Site 1 to Site 7 belongs to H atom downwards. Because of the negative polarity of the O atom and the positive polarity of H atom, the two H atoms tend to close the Br atoms in the Cs2AgBiBr6 surface. However, the O atom prefers to situate at the center of the two H atoms or close to the Cs atom. We also investigate the adsorption energy of molecule adsorption on Cs2AgBiBr6 with two layers. Its result is not much different from the Cs2AgBiBr6 monolayer. In summary, Cs2AgBiBr6 has the potential for H2O adsorption and H2 desorption, and can be used as a competitive photocatalyst theoretically.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we theoretically analyzed the electronic structures and optical properties of lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 (1L–5L) by DFT calculations, exhibiting a thickness-dependent band structure and optical performance. From 5L to 2L, with the decreased layer numbers, the value of band gap got larger and the quantum size effect induced gradually rising CBM and decreasing VBM. Our results demonstrated that 2D layered perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 can be used as a potential photocatalyst due to its good carrier mobility of charge carriers and excellent visible light absorption. Importantly, Cs2AgBiBr6 with different layers has an appropriate band edge alignment for many photocatalytic reactions and excellent ability of H2O adsorption as well as H2 desorption for hydrogen production theoretically. Furthermore, our calculations predict that Cs2AgBiBr6 moves from an indirect band gap to a direct band gap until the thickness is reduced to the monolayer. In a word, this study indicates that Cs2AgBiBr6 provided more possibilities for photocatalytic applications and also inspired more explorations into lead-free double perovskite materials.
