    , Accepted 15th January 2019First published on 15th January 2019AbstractConstructing a built-in electric field at the interface of semiconductors has been demonstrated to provide the driving force for spatial charge separation in photocatalysis. Although phase junctions (interfaces formed between two crystalline phases of the same semiconductor) have been demonstrated to be effective in spatial charge separation, regulation of the photocatalytic activity by precisely tuning the built-in electric fields is not yet well understood. In this work, taking anatase/rutile TiO2 phase junction as an example, the built-in electric field in the phase junction region was modulated via fabricating controllable anatase nanoparticles on rutile TiO2 surface to manipulate the interfacial contact area between anatase and rutile phases. We found that photocatalytic H2 evolution depends strongly on the interfacial contact area between anatase and rutile TiO2. The relation between the anatase/rutile phase junction interfacial contact area and the specific photocatalytic activity shows a typical volcano curve, that is, increasing the interfacial contact area results in enhancement of the driving force for spatial charge separation, allowing more electrons and holes to migrate to the surface and participate in redox reactions, but further increasing the interfacial contact area leads to decline of photocatalytic activity. The optimized interfacial contact is the most favorable balance between the strength of built-in electric field and transfer distance for photogenerated charge carriers for separation and transfer of photo-generated electrons and holes at the phase junction region. Our work provides new insight into the construction of built-in electric fields on the surface of semiconductor-based photocatalysts to boost spatial charge separation for solar energy conversion systems.
1 Introduction
Sunlight-driven photoelectric energy conversion and storage are widely regarded as promising potential technologies to help alleviate the global energy crisis and environmental pollution.1–10 Solar cells, Li/Na secondary batteries, and electrochemical capacitors have presented attractive prospects for conversion and storage of solar energy into electric energy.11–13 Among these energy conversion and storage devices, TiO2 has been widely studied as a promising anode material for solar cells and secondary batteries because of its intrinsic reliability, abundance and eco-friendliness.14–17
In recent years, conversion of solar energy into high density and portable hydrogen fuel through semiconductor photocatalysts such as TiO2 has emerged as a desirable alternative for practical utilization of clean solar energy.18,19 In photocatalysis, photogenerated charge separation is one of the most challenging and concerning issues and definitely determines the efficiency of solar energy conversion systems.20–27 Constructing a heterojunction or p–n junction is a general strategy to improve spatial charge separation, which is driven by the interfacial electric field at the interface between different semiconductors.28–33 In particular, phase junctions formed between two different polymorphs of phases with exactly the same composition were found to be an effective strategy to achieve efficient charge separation in photocatalysis.34–36 For example, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has several common crystalline structures (e.g., anatase, rutile) and its highest photocatalytic activity is usually obtained from samples with a mixture of anatase and rutile phases, not pure crystalline forms.34 Compared with a heterojunction composed of two different semiconductors, phase junctions can provide continuity of band bending and accelerate efficient charge transfer across the interface.37 Phase junctions have received a great attention for design of efficient photocatalysts with polycrystalline phases and have been successfully fabricated in many semiconductors (e.g., TiO2,34 Bi2O3,38,39 WO3,40,41 Fe2O3,42 BiPO4,43 BiVO4,44,45 NaNbO3,46 and CdS47,48).
The driving force for spatial charge separation at the phase junction region is provided by the built-in electric field at the interface of different crystalline phases of a semiconductor. A built-in electric field up to ∼1 kV cm−1 has been detected at the TiO2 anatase/rutile phase junction interface, which dominates the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges across the phase junction region under light irradiation.49 It was also reported that an ultrafast charge transfer and separation process (approximately 3–6 ps) only takes place when a well-defined α/β phase junction is formed at the interface between α-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3.50 These examples provide evidence why surface phase junctions are essential and efficient for inducing spatial charge separation in photocatalysis. However, precisely manipulating the interface of the phase junction, especially the interfacial contact which is closely related to the strength of built-in electric field, is still not well understood.
In this study, we chose anatase/rutile TiO2 (A/R) phase junction as an example to manipulate the built-in electric field of phase junctions for photocatalytic H2 evolution. The built-in electric field of the anatase/rutile phase junction was tuned by precisely controlling the interfacial contact area between anatase and rutile phase, through fabrication of different sizes of anatase nanoparticles (from 7 to 26 nm) on the rutile surface. It is found that photocatalytic H2 evolution activity depends strongly on the interfacial contact area between anatase and rutile. The relation between interfacial contact area and photocatalytic activity shows a typical volcano curve. The optimized interface between anatase and rutile phases is demonstrated to be the most favorable for separation and transfer of photo-generated electrons and holes at the phase junction region, further verified by electrochemical impedance and surface photovoltage characterizations.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT, Ti[O(CH2)3CH3]4), triethanolamine (TEOA, N(CH2CH2OH)3), nitric acid (HNO3), and absolute ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China). All the above chemicals were of analytical grade and used directly without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of photocatalysts
The preparation procedure of rutile TiO2 (denoted as R) by hydrolysis of TBOT is similar to our previous work.51 Uniform anatase TiO2 nanoparticles with different particle sizes were loaded onto R using gel–sol method, analogous to the method described previously,52 followed by a low-temperature hydrothermal method.
Anatase nanoparticles loaded on R samples were prepared as follows: a stock solution of Ti4+ was prepared by mixing a certain amount of TBOT with TEOA at a molar ratio of TBOT:TEOA = 1:2 at ambient temperature under dry air to avoid hydrolyzation of Ti4+ ions. Then, the pH value of the stock solution was adjusted to 0.9, 4.2, or 7.8 by adding HNO3, followed by diluting the stock solution with deionized water to 20 mL. The final solution was transferred into a serum bottle and aged at 60 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, a certain amount of R was added into the above suspension under vigorous stirring at room temperature for 1 h. Then the mixed solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and aged at 140 °C for 72 h. The precipitate was collected, washed several times with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C overnight. The obtained products were denoted as n A/R, where n is the loading amount (wt%) of A. For comparison, anatase TiO2 (denoted as A) was synthesized by a similar procedure as n A/R except for addition of R.
2.3 Structure characterization
The crystalline structures of the as-synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, using a Rigaku RotaflexRu-200 B diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at a speed of 5° min−1. Ultraviolet (UV) Raman spectra excited at 325 nm were acquired on a home-assembled UV Raman spectrograph (DL-3 UV Raman spectroscopy with operando system) with spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. The power of the 325 nm laser was 3.0 mW. The particle size and morphology of samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI, Quanta 200 F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI, TECNAI spirit) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL, JEM-2100). Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were measured on a JASCO V-650 UV-Vis spectrophotometer between 200 nm to 800 nm with BaSO4 as a reference. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was determined by Quantachrome NOVA 4200e surface area and pore size analyzer.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and Mott–Schottky curves were measured on an electrochemical workstation (Ivium Vertex One, Shanghai Chenhua, China) and carried out in a three-electrode system with a working electrode, Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as reference electrode, and Pt foil as the counter electrode. 0.1 M Na2SO4 was used as the electrolyte solution. A 300 W Xe lamp (Beijing Perfect Light Co., China) was used as the light source. The working electrode was prepared by dip-coating TiO2 slurry on an F-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass electrode (2 cm × 0.5 cm) and drying at room temperature in the air. In EIS measurements, the frequency was scanned from 100 kHz to 100 mHz.
The surface photovoltage measurements (SPV) were conducted by an instrument assembled with a photovoltaic cell where the photocatalyst powders are caught between two ITO electrodes (d = 1.2 mm, resistivity: 8–12 Ω cm−2, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). A lock-in amplifier (SR830 DSP, Stanford Research Systems, USA) was applied to amplify the photovoltage signals of samples and a 500 W xenon lamp (CHF-XM-500W, Beijing Perfect Light Co., China) was used as the optical source, coupled with a grating monochromator (Omni-λ3007, Zolix, China) to provide monochromatic light. No external bias was applied.
2.5 Photocatalytic reaction
Photocatalytic H2 evolution from methanol/water solutions was carried out in a top-irradiation quartz cell connected to a closed glass gas circulation system (Labsolar-IIIAG, Beijing Perfect light Co., China). In a photocatalytic reaction, the TiO2 photocatalyst (0.05 g) was suspended in an aqueous solution containing H2O (90 mL) and CH3OH (10 mL) and then 332 μL of H2PtCl6·6H2O (2 mg mL−1) was added to the reaction system. The suspension was thoroughly evacuated and then irradiated by a 300 W xenon (Xe) lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfect Light Co., China) without a filter. The photocatalytic reaction solution was kept 20 cm away from the Xe lamp and the irradiation power of the lamp at the solution distance was 192.4 mW cm−2. After irradiation under Xe light source, H2PtCl6·6H2O was photo-reduced to Pt by photogenerated electrons in TiO2 and Pt was photodeposited onto the TiO2 sample. The amount of Pt deposited onto the TiO2 sample can be estimated based on the amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O added. The amount of evolved H2 was determined by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC7900 gas chromatography system, Shanghai Techcomp. LTD, Ar carrier).
3 Results and discussion
The phase junction formed at A/R TiO2 has been demonstrated to be effective at improving charge separation efficiency in photocatalysis.53,54 During spatial charge separation in the A/R phase junction induced by the built-in electric field, photogenerated electrons transfer from rutile to anatase phase, while photogenerated holes migrate from anatase to rutile phase. Thus, the built-in electric field at the A/R junction region is determined by the contact interface between anatase and rutile TiO2, which consequently influences the kinetics for charge separation and recombination. Since the particle size of semiconductors is closely correlated to surface band bending and electric field across the space charge region,55,56 the built-in electric field at the A/R phase junction was tuned via controllably fabricating anatase nanoparticles on rutile TiO2 surface to manipulate the interface contact between anatase and rutile phases in this work (Fig. 1). Different anatase nanoparticles at the rutile surface generate varied interfacial contact areas between anatase and rutile phases, which induces the formation of different surface band bending at the space charge region in the built-in electric field. The optimization of anatase nanoparticle size is a process to optimize the built-in electric field for spatial charge separation at the anatase/rutile phase junction region.

To realize the tunability of the built-in electric field in the phase junction, controllable anatase (A) nanoparticles were fabricated on the rutile (R) surface. Fig. 2 illustrates the synthetic procedure of A/R TiO2 phase junction photocatalyst. Pure rutile particles of 500 nm were prepared, anatase precursor was deposited on the rutile surface, and finally anatase nanoparticles were crystallized in situ on rutile by hydrothermal method. In this process, the particle size of anatase was precisely tuned, and thus the interfacial contact area between anatase and rutile was tuned, by varying the pH value from 0.9 to 7.8. It should be noted that for a fixed pH value, increasing the amount of anatase precursor does not obviously change the particle size, but does increase anatase particle numbers on the rutile surface.
 Fig. 2  The synthetic procedure of A/R TiO2 phase junction photocatalyst. 
The morphology and microstructure of A/R samples were characterized by SEM and TEM. In Fig. 3a, pure R exhibits spherical morphology with a smooth surface and the particle size is 500 nm in diameter. After fabricating the same amount of anatase under different pH values, TEM images of 1 wt% A/R indicated that the nanospheres deposited on the surface of the larger particles are about 7.8, 16.3, and 26.9 nm for increasing pH values of anatase precursor solution from 0.9 to 7.8, respectively (Fig. 3b, c, and d). Furthermore, HRTEM of A/R revealed larger particles with lattice fringe spacing of ca. 3.221 Å assigned to (110) plane of rutile phase, while the lattice spacing of 3.511 Å marked in the small nanospheres corresponds to (101) plane of anatase phase (Fig. 3e, f).

For A/R samples, it is observed that anatase nanospheres exhibit uniform spherical geometry and are well-dispersed on the surface of rutile TiO2 particles (Fig. 3g–i). Moreover, the pH value of anatase precursor solution is the key factor determining the particle size of spherical anatase. With increasing pH value, the spherical anatase particles become larger, with average diameters estimated to be 7 nm, 16 nm, and 26 nm. Typical SEM images of 1% A16/R are provided to give the size distribution and statistics of anatase nanoparticles on the surface of rutile particles (Fig. S1†). In the following sections, these A/R samples are labeled as n A7/R, n A16/R, and n A26/R, where n represents the loading amount of anatase.
XRD and UV Raman spectroscopy were conducted to provide detailed information about the bulk and surface structures of A/R samples. Fig. 4 displays the XRD patterns and UV Raman spectra of the representative A16/R samples. The XRD diffraction peaks (27.6°, 36.1°, 41.2°, 54.3° and 56.6°) and typical Raman bands located at 235, 443, and 612 cm−1 match well with rutile TiO2.57,58 A16/R samples also exhibited single-phasic rutile TiO2 when the anatase component is below 3%. From the enlarged XRD pattern shown in Fig. 4b, a very weak peak at 25.5° assigned to anatase TiO2 can be observed when the loading amount of A16 is 3%; the intensity increased with increasing loading amount of A16 from 3 to 7%.

Our previous results34,51 showed that UV Raman spectroscopy excited by a UV laser line is more surface sensitive for TiO2 than XRD because TiO2 strongly absorbs UV light. In this study, UV Raman spectroscopy (the laser line at 325 nm was selected as the excitation source) was introduced to investigate the surface phase of A16/R samples (Fig. 4c) and is sensitive for differentiation of the phase components of TiO2 surface.51 Even when the amount of A16 is as low as 1%, the Raman bands at 144, 515, and 638 cm−1 attributed to anatase59 were observed in addition to bare rutile TiO2 (235, 443, and 612 cm−1), suggesting the formation of anatase TiO2 on the surface of rutile TiO2. Similar results are observed from XRD patterns and UV Raman spectra of A7/R and A26/R samples (Fig. S2†). These results from SEM, TEM, XRD, and UV Raman confirmed that A7, A16, and A26 were indeed deposited on the surface of the rutile phase by hydrothermal method. Furthermore, considering the range of the anatase particle sizes, the interfacial contact area between anatase particle and rutile can be precisely tuned by controlling the particle size of anatase.
Pure R and representative A16/R samples were subjected to photocatalytic hydrogen production (Fig. 5a) to evaluate their photocatalytic performances. Obviously, bare R exhibits relatively low photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. However, when only a small amount of A is present, the photocatalytic activity rises remarkably. All A16/R samples exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity compared with pure R. The optimized amount of A16 is ∼5%, with the highest photocatalytic activity among A16/R samples, and its activity is more than 8 times that of the R sample. To make the results more comparable, all photocatalytic activities of these samples were normalized by specific surface area (Table S1†) of A16/R photocatalysts. Compared with the overall photocatalytic activity, the rate of H2 production per surface area shows a similar trend for the A16/R samples (Fig. 5a). The apparent (or external) solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of pure R and 5% A16/R was estimated to be approximately 0.01% and 0.08% at 300 nm (estimation of STH efficiency can be found in ESI†).

Further increasing the amount of A16 leads to decreased photocatalytic activity, which could be due to the surface of rutile particles being covered by an excess of A16 (Fig. S3†). This result also indicates that the enhanced photocatalytic performance indeed originates from the tunable built-in electric field at the phase junction, not from the increasing numbers of anatase nanoparticles themselves. Since the interfacial contact areas varied along with the loading of anatase, the built-in electric field at the interface between anatase and rutile was therefore optimized in this process, improving charge separation and photocatalytic activity.
To verify the feasibility of the charge separation at A/R phase junction, Mott–Schottky curves and K–M plots for A and R samples were examined (Fig. 6a and b). For bare rutile without anatase nanoparticles, the minimum conduction band and maximum valence band are calculated to be −0.37 and 2.63 eV, respectively, while those for the A16 sample are −0.25 and 2.95 eV. Therefore, the band structures of R and A16 match well and could feasibly form a charge separation path similar to type II heterojunction (Fig. 6c).
 Fig. 6  (a) Mott–Schottky curves, (b) UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (inset: plots of (αhν)1/2vs. photon energy), and (c) schematic illustration of the band structures of A16 and R samples. 
Thus, we speculate that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of A16/R can be predominantly ascribed to the phase junction effect at the anatase and rutile interface, which is further supported by HRTEM (Fig. S4b†). The charge separation at the interface of A/R phase junction is confirmed on A7/R and A26/R samples, as shown in HRTEM, Mott–Schottky curves and UV-vis spectra (Fig. 3f, S4d, S5†), implying that spatial charge separation can be realized at A/R phase junctions. However, a physically mixed sample (pure A16 and R powder ground and mixed together, denoted 5% A16 + R) presents much lower photocatalytic activity per surface area than 5% A16/R possessing A/R phase junctions (Fig. S6†). Furthermore, a long-term stability test was performed on 5% A16/R photocatalyst. As displayed in Fig. 5b, 5% A16/R photocatalyst with phase junctions shows very stable behavior after more than 4 cycles, suggesting its superior stability.
To investigate the effect of interfacial contact area between A and R on charge separation, the photocatalytic activities of A16/R samples were normalized by the total interfacial contact area between A16 particles and rutile (St, estimation of St can be found in ESI†) and the corresponding results are displayed in Fig. 7a. Interestingly, we found that the specific activities of different A16/R samples remain almost unchanged even when the loading amount of anatase is varied from 1% to 5%. Interfacial regions in photocatalysts with heterojunctions or phase junctions directly correlate with photogenerated charge separation and catalytic reaction. There is not much difference in the activity of the catalytic reaction in the presence of sacrificial agent and the photocatalytic activity may be mainly determined by the photogenerated charge separation efficiency. As discussed above, the anatase nanoparticles or rutile particles have similar sizes and shapes for A16/R samples with varied amounts of anatase. Thus, the interfacial contact area formed by a single anatase particle and rutile (Ss) is similar for different A16/R samples and the A16/R samples show similar specific photocatalytic activities (specific rate of H2 evolution normalized by St). Interestingly, for A7/R or A26/R samples, similar specific photocatalytic activities (photocatalytic activities of A7/R and A26/R samples were normalized by St) are also observed when the A7 or A26 loading amount is varied (Fig. S7†). These results clearly reveal that the A/R phase junctions with similar Ss exhibit similar built-in electric fields, thus showing comparable specific photocatalytic activities.

In order to further identify the optimal built-in electric field induced by A/R phase junction, the specific rate of H2 evolution (activity normalized by total interfacial surface area) vs. particle size of anatase is plotted in Fig. 7b. The different interfacial contact areas Ss were estimated from samples with different anatase particle sizes (A7, A16, and A26) and the loading amount (5 wt%) of anatase for these samples was kept the same. With particle size increasing (that is, increasing Ss) from 7 to 16 nm, specific photocatalytic H2 production activity increases remarkably, attributed to the increase of the strength of the built-in electric field induced by increasing the interfacial contact area in the A/R phase junction region. However, the specific activity for H2 evolution decreases with further increasing particle size to 26 nm, possibly due to a longer travelling pathway for the charge carriers and an increased likelihood of charge recombination. The improvement in specific photocatalytic activity for A/R phase junction strongly depends on a balance between the strength of the built-in electric field and the transfer distance for photogenerated charge carriers.
Electrochemical impedance and surface photovoltage (SPV) characterizations were employed to verify the above results (Fig. 7c and d). Note that the trend in photocatalytic activity of A/R samples with different anatase particle sizes is consistent with their electrochemical impedance spectra; that is, higher hydrogen production activity gives a smaller arc radius of Nyquist plots in impedance spectra. The smaller arc radius of Nyquist plot for the photocatalyst suggests weaker charge-transfer resistance, namely, efficient separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes, and vice versa.60,61 A16/R has the smallest arc radius, suggesting that the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes is fastest in A16/R, compared with A7/R and A26/R.
In surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements, the SPV signal is attributed to the change in surface potential barriers before and after light illumination. SPV amplitude as a function of the incident wavelength reveals the light-responsive wavelength range and the separation extent of the photogenerated charges in semiconductor materials.62,63 Generally, a higher SPV response intensity indicates a higher separation rate of photoexcited electron–holes and a lower SPV response intensity expresses a lower separation rate.64–66 In comparison with A7/R and A26/R, the observed SPV intensity was significantly strengthened in A16/R, indicating that the improved separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs was achieved by loading A16 onto rutile particles.
The above results clearly indicate that the anatase particle size plays an essential role in promoting spatial charge separation at the anatase/rutile phase junction because varying the anatase particle sizes tunes the interfacial contact area at the junction and the migration distance that photogenerated charges must overcome to participate in surface redox reactions (Fig. 8). With increasing interfacial contact area, the driving force for spatial charge separation provided by the built-in electric field is consequently enhanced, so that more electrons and holes migrate to the surface and participate in redox reactions. However, when the particle size of anatase is further increased, the separated electrons and holes must travel a longer distance to reach the outer surface of the photocatalyst; moreover, the driving force provided by the built-in electric field is limited and not able to force charge separation and long-distance transfer. In this case, the probability of charge recombination is likely increased, resulting in suppression of photocatalytic activity. In our experiment, the optimized anatase particle size is ∼16 nm for anatase/rutile phase junctions, as its performance is superior to both 7 and 26 nm anatase particles. Therefore, the built-in electric field at the anatase/rutile phase junction can be successfully tuned via manipulation of the interfacial contact area between anatase and rutile phases, realizing efficient spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we rationally designed and tuned the built-in electric field of anatase/rutile TiO2 phase junction via fabricating controllable interfacial contact areas between two crystalline phases. Photocatalytic H2 evolution results indicate that the photocatalytic activity depends strongly on the interfacial contact area between anatase and rutile TiO2. The relation between interfacial contact area and photocatalytic activity shows a typical volcano curve and manipulation of interfacial contact area at anatase/rutile phase region is a process that optimizes the strength of the built-in electric field. The optimized interface between anatase and rutile phases was found to be most favorable for separation and transfer of photo-generated electron and holes at the phase junction region. It is anticipated that more efficient photocatalysts with phase junctions or heterojunctions could be designed and developed based on these insights into the design of interfacial structure.
