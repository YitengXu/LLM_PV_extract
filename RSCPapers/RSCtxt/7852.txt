    , Accepted 20th October 2017First published on 21st October 2017AbstractAs one of the degradation products, molecular I2 was recently found to rapidly decompose the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite to form PbI2. However, the microscopic details of the degradation process are unclear. In this work, the reactions between MAI- and PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 (110) surfaces and I2 molecules were investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our study shows that the I2 molecule is readily adsorbed on the surfaces, and preferentially forms a triiodide (I3−) ion with a surface iodide ion. This then facilitates the formation of a split interstitial iodide defect with a small activation energy. On the other hand, I˙ radicals, generated in photolysis of molecular I2, were found to react more readily with the perovskite surfaces, again forming split interstitial iodide defects and surface I3− ions. We also studied the properties of photo-generated electrons and holes on the MAPbI3 surfaces, and their roles in the degradation process. While the excess electrons tend to delocalize on the perovskite surfaces, the excess holes can be strongly trapped around several surface iodides. The presence of the excess electrons or holes was found to enhance I˙ radical adsorption and its reaction with the MAPbI3 surfaces. Besides, we identified the mechanism of the formation of a surface I3− ion from the surface-trapped holes without the addition of molecular I2. This provides a key understanding of photo-induced MAPbI3 degradation in a vacuum. Finally, we discuss how the formation of the split interstitial iodide defects induces the decrease in the distance between two neighboring Pb ions which leads to the formation of the local PbI2 structure.
1. Introduction
Metal-halide perovskites have attracted great attention as next generation photovoltaic materials in the last few years, due to their low band gaps, tunable optical absorption and long charge carrier diffusion lengths.1–3 These halide-based perovskites are a class of crystalline materials that have a general formula of AMX3, where A = Cs+, CH3NH3+, CH(NH2)2+, etc.; M = Sn2+, Pb2+, Ge2+, etc.; and X = Cl−, Br−, I−, etc.4–10 These perovskites have been extensively studied as the light-harvesting layers in photovoltaic cells.11 Due to these efforts, the power conversion efficiencies of perovskite solar cells based on the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) compound have rocketed from an initial value of 3.8% to now about 22%.12–14
To improve the overall performance of perovskite solar cells, tremendous efforts have been made to optimize the photoactive layers and the configurations of the devices. Unfortunately, practical application of this class of solar cells has been hindered by the short lifetimes of halide-based perovskites.15–21 Numerous experiments have been carried out to understand the factors that lead to the rapid degradation. Researchers have found that humid air (O2 and H2O), heat and illumination are several of the main factors affecting the stability of MAPbI3.15,22–25 Under illumination and in humid air, Wang and coworkers found that MAPbI3 decomposes readily to PbI2 and I2.22 On the other hand, Haque et al. suggested that superoxides could react with MAPbI3, generating I2 as one of the decomposition products.26 Navrotsky and coworkers found that the formation enthalpy of MAPbI3 from PbI2 and MAI is positive, confirming that MAPbI3 is thermodynamically unstable.25 To make matters worse, the chemical and physical properties of MAPbI3 materials can further be affected by residual degradation products such as PbI2 and I2.27,28 Recently, Qi and coworkers found that the decomposition of MAPbI3 was accelerated by exposure to iodine vapor.27 They showed that the I2 molecules, as a degradation product, rapidly decompose the MAPbI3 perovskite to PbI2.27 Meanwhile, the residual PbI2 in the MAPbI3 layer could increase trap state density, resulting in the decrease of the overall power conversion efficiencies of solar cells.28
The chemical and structural stability of MAPbI3 (e.g., phase change, point defects, ion diffusion, etc.) as well as its decomposition pathways under humid air conditions have also been extensively studied by density functional theory (DFT) simulations.29–42 De Angelis and coworkers showed that the MAI-terminated MAPbI3 surface rapidly decomposed in the presence of bulk water using ab initio molecular dynamics calculations.41 Our previous studies also revealed the key roles of water, hydroxyl radicals, hydroxide ions, oxygens and mobile electrons in the degradation of MAPbI3.33,34,43 On the other hand, DFT studies have shown that the migration of vacancies (especially for iodine vacancies VI+) and interstitials (such as iodine interstitials Ii−) in MAPbI3 was one of the main reasons for the decomposition of MAPbI3, adversely impacting its chemical and structural stability.29,44–48 Besides, DFT studies combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has also revealed the important details of the surface structural stability of halide-based perovskites.49,50 Previous theoretical studies have demonstrated DFT calculations as a powerful tool to the reveal important microscopic details of the degradation of perovskite materials.
In this work, we study the role of iodine in the degradation of MAPbI3 (110) surfaces. It was recently found that the decomposition of MAPbI3 was accelerated by exposure to iodine vapor,27 but the microscopic understanding of the reactions is limited. Here, we consider both MAI- and PbI2-terminated surfaces with a view to revealing the microscopic details of the reaction mechanisms. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we describe the computational details of our DFT calculations. In Section 3, we present and discuss our results of the studies of the degradation reactions of the MAPbI3 (110) surfaces. First, we studied the reactions between the perovskite surfaces and molecular I2. Then, we investigated the reactions of I˙ radicals, which are generated from molecular I2 through photochemical processes, with the perovskite surfaces. Finally, the properties of the photo-generated electrons and holes on the perovskite surfaces, and their roles in the degradation were also studied. Our conclusions are presented in Section 4.
2. Computational details
At room temperature, the most stable phase of crystalline MAPbI3 is tetragonal, and its corresponding bulk lattice parameters are a = 8.88 Å and c = 12.63 Å.51 We constructed slab models for both the MAI-terminated and PbI2-terminated (110) surfaces from the bulk structure with 2.5 layers. The MAI-terminated and PbI2-terminated surface have a thickness of 15.5 and 14.0 Å respectively. A vacuum length of ∼12 Å was introduced between the periodic slabs. Then the two slabs were respectively expanded to  surface supercells (17.8 Å × 17.8 Å), and the corresponding chemical formulae are (MAPbI3)16(MAI)8 and (MAPbI3)16(PbI2)8. The optimized structures of the two surfaces are shown in Fig. 1. We used the same model as that of our previous work which has been tested to be adequate for the study.43 Further tests on this model are also included in Section SI1 of the ESI.† Previous studies have suggested that the MAPbI3 (110) surface is important to the performance of perovskite solar cells, and therefore we chose this surface as the prototypical model to study in this work.52,53 All the calculations were performed with Gamma point sampling as the supercells adopted are adequately large.

We conducted the density functional theory (DFT)54,55 calculations using the QUANTUM ESPRESSO package.56 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA)-PBE57 functional and ultra-soft, scalar relativistic pseudopotentials were used.58 The DFT simulations also included van der Waals (vdW) correction of Grimme and coworkers.59,60 A plane wave basis set of 30 and 240 Ry cutoffs was employed for the wavefunctions and the augmented charge density, respectively. Spin-polarized calculations were carried out for the systems with unpaired electrons (e.g., I˙ radicals and excess holes and electrons), while spin-unpolarized calculations were applied to the remaining systems. The adsorption energies of the species (I˙ or I2) on the MAPbI3 surface were calculated using the following equation: Eads = E(species/surface) − E(species) − E(surface), where E(surface), E(species), and E(species/surface) refer to the total energy of the MAPbI3 surface, the species (I˙ or I2), and the perovskite surface adsorbed with the species, respectively. Moreover, the activation energy of ion diffusion was obtained by the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method.61 To obtain the charge states of the species formed on the MAPbI3 surfaces, we employed the maximally localized Wannier function (MLWF)62,63 analysis approach which has been applied in the previous study.64 The MLWF analysis was performed using the Wannier90 package.65
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Reactions of I2 molecules with the MAI-terminated surfaces
Previous studies27 showed that the presence of I2 accelerates the degradation of the MAPbI3 perovskite to the products like PbI2 within one hour. It happens in the dark without photo-generated holes and electrons. In this subsection, we focus on the reaction of I2 molecules with the MAI-terminated surfaces. We first introduced an I2 molecule onto the surface and the optimized structure is shown in Fig. 2a (top view) and b (side view). The adsorption energy of the I2 molecule is −29.7 kcal mol−1. As shown in the figures, the I2 molecule forms a covalent bond with a surface I− ion, forming a triiodide ion (I3−). Experimental studies also suggested that I3− species can be formed in the initial steps of the degradation process in the presence of iodine vapor.27 The I–I bond lengths (d(I–I) = 2.87, 3.02 Å) of the I3− ion are close to those of an isolated I3− ion (d(I–I) = 2.96, 2.96 Å) in our PBE calculation. The experimental I–I bond lengths of I3− vary (2.7–3.2 Å) depending on its chemical environment.66 Meanwhile, the resulting triiodide ion forms a H⋯I hydrogen bond (d(H–I) = 2.58 Å) with a hydrogen in the NH3 group of a top-layer CH3NH3+ (MA) cation.

The color codes for different atoms follow those in Fig. 1. To distinguish different types of iodide ions, the iodide ions in the I2 molecules are highlighted in green while the iodide ions in the pristine surfaces are highlighted in purple. 
After that we found that the triiodide ion facilitates the formation of a split interstitial iodide defect via the diffusion of a surface iodide. Cl-NEB calculations were carried out to determine the activation energy for this process. The transition state, final state and energy profile are shown in Fig. 2c–g, respectively. The activation energy is +3.7 kcal mol−1. The final state (Fig. 2e and f) is lower in energy than the initial state (Fig. 2a and b) by 4.4 kcal mol−1. The charge states of the selected iodines for the structure in Fig. 2e were also calculated through the MLWF analysis.64 The details of the charge state calculations are discussed in Section SI2 of the ESI.† The charge state calculations show that the Ia iodine (marked in Fig. 2e) formed a split interstitial Ii− with two neighboring lead ions (highlighted in the orange rectangle in Fig. 2e). The subscript in Ii− denotes the interstitial nature of the defect. The distance between the two lead ions (d(Pb–Pb)) equals 5.00 Å, which is much shorter than the Pb–Pb distance (d(Pb–Pb) = 6.19 Å) in the pristine MAI-terminated surface. The MLWF analysis also confirms that the charge state of the triiodide (highlighted in the blue rectangle in Fig. 2e) is −1. The terminal iodine of the triiodide (marked as Ib in Fig. 2e) also moves closer to the original site of Ia.
3.2 Reactions of I2 molecules with the PbI2-terminated surfaces
Next, we introduced an I2 molecule onto the PbI2-terminated surfaces. The optimized structure is shown in Fig. 3a (top view) and b (side view). As shown in the figures, one iodine atom of the I2 molecule is covalently bonded to a surface iodide ion forming a surface triiodide. The other iodine is also bonded to a surface Pb ion. The two I–I bond distances of the triiodide ion are 2.94 and 2.97 Å. The corresponding adsorption energy is −29.0 kcal mol−1. Similar to the case of the MAI-terminated surface, a split interstitial iodine defect and a new surface triiodide can be subsequently formed. We performed CI-NEB calculations to obtain the energy barrier for this process. The transition state, the final state and the energy profile are shown in Fig. 3c–g respectively. The activation energy is +2.1 kcal mol−1, and the energy difference between the final state (Fig. 3e and f) and the initial state (Fig. 3a and b) is −2.5 kcal mol−1. In the transition state, the triiodide is broken into an I2 and an iodide ion. The charge states of the selected iodines for the structure in Fig. 3e were calculated through the MLWF analysis approach. The details of the analysis are discussed in detail in Section SI3 of the ESI.† The charge state calculations show that one iodide of the original triiodide ion forms a split interstitial Ii− (highlighted in the orange rectangle in Fig. 3e) with two neighboring Pb ions (d(Pb–Pb) = 4.56 Å) in the final state. This Pb–Pb distance is significantly shorter than that in the pristine PbI2-terminated surfaces (d(Pb–Pb) = 6.32 Å). Moreover, the MLWF analysis also confirmed that the triiodide ion formed in the final state (highlighted in the blue rectangle in Fig. 3e) has a charge state of −1. The I–I distances of this I3− ion are 2.92 and 3.01 Å. Moreover, the distance between the two Pb ions (d(Pb–Pb) = 4.56 Å) involved in the split interstitial Ii− is shorter than that of the Pb–Pb distance in the MAI-terminated surfaces in Section 3.1 (d(Pb–Pb) = 5.00 Å). The reason for the shorter distance is that there are dangling bonds in the Pb ions in the top layer of the PbI2-terminated surface, leading to stronger bonding with the iodide defect.

The color codes for different atoms follow those in Fig. 1. To distinguish different types of iodide ions, the iodide ions in the I2 molecules are highlighted in green while the iodide ions in the pristine surfaces are highlighted in purple. 
3.3 Reactions of I˙ radicals with the MAI-terminated surfaces
As stated in the Introduction, it was experimentally found that under illumination, the degradation rates of the perovskites in the presence of I2 vapor were much faster than those in the dark.27 It has been suggested that I2 molecules can rapidly photo-dissociate into two iodine atoms (i.e., I˙ radicals) under visible/ultraviolet light.27,67 Therefore, we aim in this section and the next to study the reactions between the MAPbI3 (110) surfaces and the I˙ radicals.
For the reaction between the I˙ radicals and the MAI-terminated surface, two different pathways were identified (reaction paths P1 and P2). The adsorption energies of different steps in the two paths are shown in Table 1. For reaction path P1, an iodine radical first bonds to two adjacent Pb ions in the inorganic framework of PbI3− with an adsorption energy of −31.3 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 4a and Table 1). As shown in Fig. 4a (top view) and b (side view), the initial iodine site was simultaneously occupied by two iodines (the distance between the two iodines (d(I–I)) is 4.06 Å). The distance between the two adjacent Pb ions becomes 4.97 Å, which is much shorter than the Pb–Pb distance (d(Pb–Pb) = 6.25 Å) in the pristine MAI-terminated surface. With the addition of an I˙ radical, the system can be considered to have an excess hole. We also show in Fig. 4a the spin density indicating that the excess hole is mostly trapped at the iodide ions around the iodine point defect.

The spin densities are shown with the yellow isosurfaces. The color codes for different atoms follow those in Fig. 1. To distinguish different types of iodines, the added I˙ radicals are highlighted in green while the iodide ions in the pristine surfaces are highlighted in purple. 
To continue the study of reaction path P1, another iodine radical was added to the structure in Fig. 4a, and the optimized structure is shown in Fig. 4c (top view) and d (side view). As shown in Table 1, the adsorption energy of the second I˙ radical is −50.8 kcal mol−1. This I˙ radical readily reacts with two neighboring I− ions, forming a triiodide with two I–I covalent bonds (d(I–I) = 2.92, 2.98 Å). The charge states of the selected iodines for the structure in Fig. 4c were also calculated through the MLWF analysis. The details of the calculations are discussed in Section SI4 of the ESI.† By counting the Wannier centers (WCs), we found that the excess hole in Fig. 4a spontaneously transfers to the second I˙ radical so that the two added iodine radicals become a negative Ii− and a positive Ii+. The negative Ii− is involved in the split interstitial defect highlighted in the orange rectangle in Fig. 4c. The positive Ii+ forms a triiodide with two top-layer iodide ions (highlighted in the blue rectangle in Fig. 4c) with an overall charge of −1. The distance between the two Pb ions involved in the split interstitial defect is 4.90 Å. In reaction path P1, the total adsorption energies of the two I˙ radicals are −82.1 kcal mol−1.
For reaction path P2, Fig. 4e (top view) and f (side view) show that the first I˙ radical is adsorbed to a surface iodide ion. The spin density shown in Fig. 4e indicates that the excess hole is mainly trapped at the two iodines. This indicates that the resulting I2 has a charge state of −1. Previous studies also suggested that I2− species can be formed in the initial steps of the degradation process.27 The distance between the two iodines is 3.22 Å, which is close to the I–I distance of an isolated I2− ion in our PBE calculation (d(I–I) = 3.30 Å). The corresponding adsorption energy of the I˙ radical to the surface is −25.1 kcal mol−1 (Table 1).
The second I˙ radical was then added to the surface in Fig. 4e and the optimized structure is shown in Fig. 4g (top view) and h (side view). This structure is very similar to the structure in Fig. 4c with the formation of a split interstitial Ii− defect (highlighted in the orange rectangle in Fig. 4g) and a triiodide ion (highlighted in the blue rectangle in Fig. 4g). For this to happen, the excess hole from the second I˙ radical transfers to the I2− ion formed in the first step. The second I˙ radical is converted into a split interstitial Ii− defect by the adsorption to two adjacent Pb ions (d(Pb–Pb) = 5.00 Å). Meanwhile, the resulting I2 forms a triiodide ion (d(I–I) = 2.94, 2.97 Å) with an iodide ion in the top layer of the MAI-terminated surface. The corresponding adsorption energy of the second I˙ radical is −60.3 kcal mol−1 (Table 1). The total reaction energy of reaction path P2 of the two I˙ radicals to the MAI-terminated MAPbI3 surface is therefore −85.4 kcal mol−1. Since the two reaction paths (P1 and P2) produce the same surface species, the overall adsorption energies are expected to be similar for two paths. It should also be noted that the surface species produced in the reaction with an I2 molecule or with two I˙ radicals are the same (a split interstitial Ii− defect and an I3− ion).
3.4 Reactions of I˙ radicals with the PbI2-terminated surfaces
For the PbI2-terminated surface, we also identified two reaction pathways (reaction paths P3 and P4) for the reaction with the I˙ radicals. The adsorption energies of different steps in the two paths are shown in Table 2. For reaction path P3, the first I˙ radical spontaneously bonds to two adjacent Pb ions as shown in Fig. 5a (top view) and b (side view) with an adsorption energy of −34.1 kcal mol−1. This forms an interstitial iodine defect, which is similar to the structure in Fig. 4a. The resulting Pb–Pb distance is 4.66 Å, which is significantly shorter than that in the pristine PbI2-terminated surface (d(Pb–Pb) = 6.35 Å). The spin density shown in Fig. 5a indicates that the excess hole is mainly located at three iodines around the iodine defect. Then, another I˙ radical was added into the above structure, and the relaxed structure is shown in Fig. 5c (top view) and d (side view). As shown in Table 2, the adsorption energy is −48.5 kcal mol−1. The charge states of the selected iodide ions for the structure in Fig. 5c were calculated by using the MLWF analysis. The details of the calculations are shown in Section SI5 of the ESI.† The charged state calculations show that the excess hole from the first I˙ radical is spontaneously abstracted by the second I˙ radical. The second iodine now has a +1 charge, forming an I3− ion with two neighboring I− ions (highlighted in the blue rectangle in Fig. 5c). Meanwhile the first I˙ radical was converted into an interstitial Ii− by losing the excess hole (highlighted in the orange rectangle in Fig. 5c).

The adsorption of an I˙ radical (top view (e) and side view (f)) and two I˙ radicals (top view (g) and side view (h)) on the PbI2-terminated surfaces (reaction path P4). The spin densities are shown with the yellow isosurfaces. The color codes for different atoms follow those in Fig. 1. To distinguish different types of iodines, the added I˙ radicals are highlighted in green while the iodide ions in the pristine surfaces are highlighted in purple. 
For reaction path P4, the first added I˙ radical forms a covalent bond with one surface Pb ion as shown in Fig. 5e (top view) and f (side view). The corresponding adsorption energy is −25.4 kcal mol−1 (Table 2). Fig. 5e shows that the excess hole due to the addition of the I˙ radical was not as strongly trapped on the surface as in reaction path P3 (Fig. 5a). Then, the second I˙ radical was added into the above structure and the relaxed structure is shown in Fig. 5g (top view) and h (side view) which is similar to the structure in Fig. 5c. The adsorption energy was found to be −55.7 kcal mol−1. Therefore, the total adsorption energy for the two I˙ radicals is −81.1 kcal mol−1. Our DFT calculations showed that there is no unpaired electron in the structure in Fig. 5g. The first I˙ radical is converted to the split interstitial Ii− defect by spontaneously forming another covalent bond with an adjacent Pb ion (highlighted in the orange rectangle in Fig. 5g). The excess hole in the structure in Fig. 5e spontaneously transfers to the second I˙ radical, forming an I3− ion with the two neighboring I− ions (highlighted in the blue rectangle in Fig. 5g). Based on the above results, we can conclude that the I3− ion and Ii− defect are also formed in the two pathways.
3.5 Excess electrons and holes on the MAI- and PbI2-terminated surfaces
As discussed earlier, electrons and holes generated in the MAPbI3 perovskite under illumination can play important roles in perovskite degradation. Previous experimental studies68 have suggested that the photo-generated electrons are delocalized, while the holes tend to form small polarons that are localized at the halide ions in the perovskite materials. However, in previous DFT calculations, strongly trapped small hole polarons were not observed in calculations using the PBE functional, hybrid PBE0 functional and Hubbard U correction of extended MAPbI3,69–71 although they found some localization features of the holes in MAPbI3. There is only a recent study using an isolated cluster model of MAPbI3 that managed to reproduce hole polarons.72
We first studied the role of excess electrons in the reactions between the MAPbI3 surfaces and the I˙ radical. An electron was respectively added to the pristine MAI and PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 (110) surfaces. The optimized structure and its spin density are shown in Fig. 6a, b, e, and f. The spin density result shows that the electron is delocalized over the Pb ions in both structures, which is in agreement with the previous experimental work.68 Then we studied the effect of the excess electrons on I˙ radical adsorption to the surface. Fig. 6c, d, g and h show the optimized structures of the I˙ radical adsorbed on the MAI and PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 surfaces with an excess electron. The adsorption energies in the two cases are −77.2 and −74.5 kcal mol−1 (Table 3), respectively, which are significantly more negative than those without an excess electron (Tables 1 and 2). Our DFT calculations show that there is no unpaired electron in the two structures (Fig. 6c and g) suggesting that there is a spontaneous electron transfer from the perovskite surface to the I˙ radical, forming a split interstitial Ii− defect. As shown in Table 3, the corresponding Pb–Pb distances are 5.12 and 4.66 Å, respectively, for the MAI and PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 surfaces.

Next, we studied the role of excess holes in the degradation process. A hole was added to the pristine MAI and PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 surfaces, respectively. We were able to identify the stable trapped-hole state with a perturbed surface structure in which the distances between the selected iodide ions are significantly shortened. The relaxed structures and spin density are shown in Fig. 7a, b, e and f. In agreement with previous experimental studies,68,73 the spin density result shows that the hole is trapped mainly at three adjacent iodide ions for both the MAI and PbI2-terminated surfaces. For the MAI-terminated surface, the I–I distances between the three adjacent iodide ions (with the localized hole) are 3.52 and 3.61 Å, which are significantly shorter than that of the I–I distances in the pristine MAI-terminated surface (4.37 and 4.61 Å). Meanwhile, for the PbI2-terminated surface (Fig. 7e), the I–I distances between the three adjacent iodide ions (with the localized hole) are 3.58 and 3.72 Å, which are also much shorter than those of the I–I distances in the pristine surface (4.45 and 4.52 Å).

The spin densities are shown with the yellow isosurfaces. The color codes for different atoms follow those in Fig. 1. To distinguish different types of iodines, the added I˙ radicals are highlighted in green while the iodide ions in the pristine surfaces are highlighted in purple. 
Then we added an I˙ radical to the MAPbI3 surfaces in Fig. 7a and e respectively, and the optimized structures are shown in Fig. 7c, d, g and h. As shown in Table 3, the corresponding adsorption energies are −55.1 and −49.9 kcal mol−1, respectively, which are also significantly more negative than those for the first I˙ radical adsorption on the surfaces without an excess hole (Tables 1 and 2). Our DFT calculations show that there is no unpaired electron in the two structures (Fig. 7c and g). The excess hole spontaneously transfers to the I˙ radical and the two neighboring I− ions, forming an I3− ion (highlighted in the blue rectangle). The bond lengths for the I3− ions are shown in Table 3.
As discussed above, the localized hole shortens the I–I distances of three adjacent iodide ions (Fig. 7a and e). This could be the precursor of the formation of an I3− ion without additional iodines. To further study the role of the excess holes, another hole was introduced into the structures in Fig. 7a and e. The corresponding optimized structures are shown in Fig. 8a–d. Both systems were found to have no net spin after the second hole addition. As shown in the figures, a triiodide ion was formed from the three surface iodides that trap the first hole for both the MAI-terminated and PbI2-terminated surfaces (highlighted in the blue rectangle in Fig. 8a and c). For the MAI-terminated surface, the I–I distances of the triiodide ion are 2.95 and 2.96 Å. For the PbI2-terminated surface, the I–I distances of the triiodide ion are 2.89 and 3.05 Å. Therefore, the MAPbI3 can decompose to generate a surface triiodide, or in another word an adsorbed molecular I2, under illumination in a vacuum. This reaction was also suggested by the previous experimental work.74 Using DFT calculations, we have identified the mechanism of this reaction leading to the formation of a triiodide from the surface-trapped holes.

3.6 The possible formation of PbI2 in the reaction between MAPbI3 and I2
Previous experiments22,27,74 showed that the PbI2 compound is one of the degradation products of MAPbI3, but its formation mechanism is not fully understood. PbI2 has a hexagonal structure with alternating layers of lead and iodide ions. Fig. 9a shows the two-dimensional (2D) layer of PbI2. This 2D layer consists of the linear frameworks of PbI2 as shown in Fig. 9b. The distance between two neighboring Pb ions in this framework is 4.56 Å, and the distance between two neighboring iodide ions is 4.62 Å. The structure of this framework is locally similar to the split interstitial Ii− defects from the reactions of the perovskite surfaces with the I2 or I˙ radicals as shown in Fig. 9c and d. Our DFT calculations found that the Pb–Pb distance in this defect varies from 4.56 to 5.12 Å depending on the surrounding chemical environment which is close to the Pb–Pb distance in the PbI2 framework. The Ii− defects induce the distortion of the MAPbI3 crystal lattice, decreasing the Pb–Pb distance that could facilitate the formation of the local PbI2 structure in agreement with the previous experimental results that PbI2 is one of the degradation products.27

4. Conclusions
Using DFT calculations, we studied the reaction of molecular I2 and I˙ radicals with MAI-terminated and PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 (110) surfaces. We also studied the properties of excess electrons and holes on the surface, and their roles in the degradation process. We found that both I2 and I˙ radicals preferentially reacted with the three-dimensional inorganic frameworks of PbI3− rather than with the organic MA cations. For the reaction with I2, the I2 molecule spontaneously forms a triiodide (I3−) ion with a top-layer iodide ion of the pristine surfaces. Via the diffusion of the iodine atoms, the resulting I3− ion on the MAPbI3 perovskite surfaces further facilitates the formation of a split interstitial Ii− defect. The activation energies for the processes are small. On the other hand, I˙ radicals, generated through photolysis of molecular I2 under illumination, are adsorbed on and react more readily with both the MAI-terminated and PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 perovskite surfaces than the molecular I2. This suggests that the presence of I˙ radicals (i.e. illumination) greatly accelerates the degradation reaction.
Excess holes and electrons can be generated by photo-excitations in the MAPbI3 surfaces, and are expected to have significant effects on the stability of the perovskite. We found that an excess electron tends to delocalize on both the pristine MAI-terminated and PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 perovskite surfaces. Upon addition of an I˙ radical, the excess electron spontaneously transfers to the I˙ radical, forming an Ii− defect on the surfaces. On the other hand, we found that an excess hole can be trapped at three adjacent iodide ions on the pristine surfaces of both terminations. Upon addition of an I˙ radical, the excess hole transfers to the I˙ radical and the two neighboring I− ions, forming an I3− ion. The presence of the excess electron or hole enhances the adsorption of the I˙ radical on the surface demonstrating their important roles in the degradation process. These results suggest that under illumination the degradation reaction is greatly accelerated, which is consistent with the previous experimental studies.27 More interestingly, we identified a mechanism for the formation of a surface I3− ion under illumination in a vacuum. We found that two excess holes are strongly trapped by three neighboring iodides on the surfaces facilitating the formation of an I3− ion. The results showed that, in a vacuum, MAPbI3 can decompose under illumination, generating surface-adsorbed I2 species, in agreement with the previous experimental work.74 Finally, we discussed the possible formation of the local PbI2 structure from the reaction between MAPbI3 and I2 or I˙ radicals. Building on this work, future investigation will involve the study of possible subsequent steps in the formation and release of the PbI2 crystal. Overall, this work provides a microscopic understanding of MAPbI3 degradation in the presence of I2 molecules which helps develop more robust perovskite materials for photovoltaic applications.

 	Fig. 7  The top view (a) and side view (b) of the relaxed structure for the MAI-terminated surface with an excess hole; the top view (c) and side view (d) of the adsorption of an I˙ radical on the MAI-terminated surface with an excess hole; the top view (e) and side view (f) of the relaxed structure for the PbI2-terminated surface with an excess hole; the top view (g) and side view (h) of the adsorption of an I˙ radical on the PbI2-terminated surface with an excess hole. The spin densities are shown with the yellow isosurfaces. The color codes for different atoms follow those in Fig. 1. To distinguish different types of iodines, the added I˙ radicals are highlighted in green while the iodide ions in the pristine surfaces are highlighted in purple.	 

 	Fig. 8  The top view (a) and side view (b) of the relaxed MAI-terminated surface with the formation of a surface triiodide after the addition of a second hole to the structure in Fig. 7a; the top view (c) and side view (d) of the relaxed PbI2-terminated surface with the formation of a surface triiodide after the addition of a second hole to the structure in Fig. 7e. The color codes for different atoms follow those in Fig. 1.	 

 	Fig. 9  (a) The structure of one layer of PbI2; (b) the linear framework of PbI2 which is cleaved from the PbI2 layer in (a); (c) the side view of an interstitial Ii− in the MAI-terminated surface; (d) the side view of an interstitial Ii− in the PbI2-terminated surface. Some atoms are omitted to provide better visualization. The color codes for different atoms follow those in Fig. 1.
