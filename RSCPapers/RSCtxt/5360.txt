    , Accepted 15th June 2021First published on 17th June 2021AbstractPretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass to specifically depolymerise lignin moieties without the loss of carbohydrates as well as to minimize the generation of harmful intermediates during the process is a major challenge in the biofuel production process. In the present study, a nanoparticle mediated pretreatment strategy was developed to specifically depolymerise lignin from corn cob biomass. The synthesized nanoparticles possessed unique enzyme mimicking characteristics that can be exploited for the deconstruction of lignin moieties. The maximum delignification was 44% using cerium doped iron oxide nanoparticles within 24 h of incubation time, at 25 °C and a high solid loading of 20% (w/v). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry study revealed the production of various lignin degraded compounds in pretreated liquids such as fatty acid methyl esters, which are the major components of fuel biodiesel. Aromatic alcohols and aldehydes were also observed during lignin degradation that has industrial importance. The remaining pretreated solid residues rich in carbohydrates can be further utilized in the generation of reducing sugars and in turn biofuels such as bioethanol, biobutanol, and biohydrogen. The value of the crystallinity index increased from 0.39 to 0.46 by delignification, indicating a total increase in biomass crystallinity. Moreover, the increase in biomass porosity indicates good biomass digestibility and in turn high reducing sugar yield. After enzymatic hydrolysis of 50 g L−1 pretreated biomass, 18.1 g L−1 of glucose and 9.12 g L−1 of xylose were released at 24 h, while the control (untreated biomass) showed a negligible amount of sugar release after hydrolysis. The recovery of nanoparticles after delignification was almost 50% of the initial concentration. The recovered catalyst was further recycled and reused, providing 37.1% delignification in the second run and 30.8% in the third run. Therefore, the obtained results in the current study substantiate the feasibility of the employed enzyme mimicking nanoparticles in the process of lignin degradation and fermentable sugar release in an eco-friendly manner.
Introduction
The world is gradually shifting from a fossil-based energy system to a renewable and sustainable energy driven system due to the exorbitant use of fossil fuels.1,2 In such a scenario, development of integrated and flexible biorefineries to generate biofuels and bioproducts is considered to release the burden from petroleum based economy as they provide energy security in an eco-friendly, sustainable, and cost-effective manner.3 It is believed that fuels and chemicals produced from biomass can complement conventional resources of energy and subsequently minimize dependence on petroleum fuels. In this context, lignocellulosic biomass as a potent bioresource can undoubtedly play a key role in our future bioenergy research due to its high capability to capture solar energy and round the year availability.4,5 Low-cost feedstocks and efficient biomass conversion technologies are two major prerequisites for any successful biofuel biorefineries.
Lignocellulosic biomass is mainly composed of cellulose (40–60%), hemicellulose (20–30%), and lignin (15–30%). Cellulose and hemicellulose act as reservoirs for sugar molecules which are further converted into ethanol.6 The recalcitrant nature of the plant cell wall is the budding problem for almost all types of biomass conversion technologies.7,8 This kind of recalcitrant or rigid nature of the plant cell wall is mainly attributed to the presence of a polyphenolic aromatic compound called lignin. It is also the major limiting factor in the conversion of biomass to biofuels or biochemicals because of its cross-linking with cellulose and hemicellulose molecules rendering them impermeable to enzymes and chemicals.9 The main objective of most biomass pretreatment methods is to deconstruct lignin molecules without altering the native structure of cellulose and hemicellulose much, which are further utilized for fermentable sugar generation.10,11 From the last decade, a number of physical, chemical, physicochemical, and biological methods have been developed for lignin degradation from lignocellulosic biomass in the process of biofuel generation.10,12–15
Physical, chemical, and physicochemical modes of lignin degradation usually bypass the greener route of biomass pretreatment and are operated under harsh operating conditions resulting in the formation of furfural and hydroxymethyl furfural, which later inhibit cellulolytic enzymes and fermenting yeast.16 Furthermore, these processes required washing of the acid and alkali pretreated biomass, which directly or indirectly pollutes land or water bodies. On the other hand, enzymes and microbes for lignin degradation encountered with the issues of stability, cost of production, and mixed end-product generation.
Apart from the strategies mentioned above, two green approaches for lignin depolymerization are attracting attention. The first approach demonstrates a ‘lignin-first’ strategy in which the lignin itself is directly valorized from raw lignocellulosic biomass instead of isolated or extracted lignin derived from a carbohydrate valorization process. Such type of approach is promising as lignin is targeted in its proto-lignin state, thus reducing the potential diversity in the lignin structure, limiting the formation of harmful byproducts, and simplifying the composition and yield of lignin products. Surprisingly, very little efforts have focused on lignin depolymerization in unfractionated lignocelluloses. The ‘lignin-first’ strategy utilizes catalytic hydrogenolysis which shows potential for utilization within an integrated biorefinery along with high yields of lignin monomers. It is also believed that the application of ionic liquids and supercritical fluids in conjunction with hydroprocessing strategies may even provide more efficient and sustainable lignin-first technologies. The second approach of lignin depolymerization resides on novel sustainable and efficient fractionation methodologies. Such type of approach works on technical lignin which can be further refined to a smaller, cleaner lignin. In this approach, different fractionation and purification processes are required for technical lignin to target the various components inside the lignin that enable a standardized and continuous supply of materials to the chemical industry. However, both approaches of lignin depolymerization are still in their early stages.17 Thus, the development of a green and efficient lignin degradation methodology is a perquisite for the whole biofuel production process.
Currently, employment of nanoscale materials (nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanoporous matrices, and nanofibers) and their process development is gaining considerable interest because of their unique properties such as large surface area, low mass transfer restriction, less fouling effect, and easy selective separation from reaction mixtures under a magnetic field.18 Nanoparticles having intrinsic enzyme mimicking properties are normally termed nanozymes that are nowadays explored as the substitutes of natural enzymes in several biomedical, industrial, and energy-related applications.19 Moreover, iron oxide nanoparticles have been reported to possess intrinsic or inherent enzyme-like properties and are now considered as unique enzyme mimetics. The key feature of nanoparticles or nanozymes is that their properties are comparable with naturally occurring enzymes or other mimetics that can be regulated either by changing morphology and size or through doping with other nanoparticles.20,21 A few studies on reductive and oxidative degradation and catalytic hydrogenolysis of lignin and lignin model compounds through nanoparticles such as zeolite supported nickel, CeO2 supported palladium, and carbon nanotube supported molybdenum oxide have been reported so far.22–24
In the present work, an attempt has been made to mimic the peroxidase activity of cerium doped magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in a green and effective way to deconstruct the lignin molecules by utilizing corn cob as a lignocellulosic feedstock. Different process parameters have been monitored for lignin degradation followed by phenolic profiling at specific time intervals which manifested the establishment of deconstruction of lignin from corn cob biomass. Furthermore, various structural characterization methods of raw and pretreated biomass were performed to authenticate the efficacy of the nanoparticle mediated lignin degradation in an eco-friendly manner. In addition, a biomass digestibility experiment was carried out to examine the efficiency of the nanoparticle mediated delignification process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report which has immediate relevance with the recent ongoing establishment of biofuel refinery. In future, enzyme immobilization on mimetic nanoparticles might also be useful for simultaneous lignin degradation and carbohydrate hydrolysis in the process of biofuel generation.
Materials and methods
Materials
Corn cob was collected from a local market of Cheongju, Korea, followed by oven drying at 60 °C and grinding to obtain a biomass particle size of 0.2 mm. The prepared powdered biomass was further used for lignin degradation studies. Cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.0%), acetic acid (CH3COOH, >99.0%), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 34.5%), sodium thiosulphate pentahydrate (98.5%), sodium carbonate, and gallic acid were acquired from Samchun Chemicals (Korea). Iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, 99.0%) and iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2·4H2O, 97.0%) were purchased from Junsei Chemical Co. Ltd (Japan). Sulfuric acid (95%) was purchased from OCI Company Ltd (Korea). Dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS), potassium permanganate (99%), Folin–Ciocalteau reagent, chitosan, and N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Acetonitrile was obtained from Jin Chemical Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd (Korea).
Isolation and identification of the fungal strain
The fungal strain was isolated from corn cob biomass in our laboratory. The strain was grown on a PDA plate and incubated at 28 °C for 7 days. The fungal strain was subjected to 18S rRNA gene sequencing for genetic identification. The amplified ITS regions/18S rRNA genes of isolates were sequenced (Bioneer, Korea) and the sequences were compared with GenBank databases using the NCBI BLAST tool. The partial ITS/18S rRNA gene sequences of these isolates were submitted to GenBank to get accession numbers.
Microbial strain and enzyme production
The identified fungal strain was used for cellulase and xylanase enzyme production. The flasks were inoculated with spores (approximately 107) derived from 15-day old cultures grown on PDA slants and incubated at 28 °C with shaking at 150 rpm. The samples were withdrawn every 2 days, centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. All supernatant samples were analyzed for extracellular cellulase activity as reported earlier.25 Cellulase and xylanase enzymes were produced under submerged fermentation conditions using the isolated fungal strain which was further used for the hydrolysis of delignified corn cob and untreated corn cob biomass samples.
Biochemical analysis of raw and delignified biomass
The ash and moisture content of the raw biomass was determined through the protocols of the standard association of analytical communities (AOAC).26 Lignin content of the biomass was assessed through an iodometric method.27 According to the method, 0.1 N potassium permanganate (7.5 mL) was used to oxidize lignin present in the biomass in an acidic environment (4 N sulfuric acid, 7.5 mL) at room temperature. After 10 min incubation at room temperature, potassium iodide (1 N, 1.5 mL) was added to the reaction mixture resulting in the formation of free iodine. The formed free iodine was titrated with 0.1 N sodium thiosulphate solution using 0.2% starch as an indicator. A blank titration without any biomass was also carried out with the same volume of water and reagent. The lignin content of the biomass was determined using the following eqn (1) and (2). Kappa number = (P × f)/W(1)where P represents mL of 0.1 N potassium permanganate solution consumed by the experimental sample, f stands for the correction factor to 50% permanganate consumption (f = 1), and W represents the weight of the dry sample (0.05 g). Lignin content (%) = (Kappa number × 0.155) × 100(2)
Lignin from biomass was also quantified through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) methodology.28 Quantification of cellulose (raw and delignified) was performed by following the method of semi-micro determination of cellulose, whereas hemicellulose was estimated by the anthrone method.29,30 Reducing sugar content of the delignified or pretreated liquor was estimated through the DNS method.31
Nanoparticle synthesis and characterization
Synthesis of nanoparticles such as cerium oxide (CeONPs), iron oxide (FeONPs), and cerium doped iron oxide (Ce-FeONPs) is shown in ESI S1.†32–34 Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of the prepared nanoparticles was carried out using a FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by following the KBr pellet technique. The spectra were recorded in a range of 4000–400 cm−1 with a spectral resolution of 32 cm−1 and 64 scans. The synthesized and dried powder nanoparticles were further analysed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Resolution 128 eV) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI Quantera-II, 20 kV) with an Al Kα = 1486.6 eV excitation source. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Carl Zeiss, LEO-1530, 20 kV) was performed to study the morphology of nanoparticles. The particles were also analysed for size determination by energy filtering transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Carl Zeiss, Libra 120), operated at 120 kV.
Peroxidase-mimicking activity of nanoparticles
The peroxidase-mimicking activity of the prepared nanoparticles was checked according to the following methodology.35 A reaction mixture containing 330 μL acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.16), 300 μL 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (6 mM), 100 μL hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (0.75 M), and 50 μL nanoparticle solution (4 mg mL−1) was added to a 24 well plate, mixed for 30 s, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, absorbance of the mixture was recorded at 652 nm. Furthermore, absorbance of TMB + H2O2, TMB + CeONPs, TMB + FeONPs, and TMB + Ce-FeONPs was also measured, respectively.
Methodology for nanoparticle mediated lignin degradation
Delignification/pretreatment of corn cob was performed in an Erlenmeyer conical flask (50 mL) containing the required amount of nanoparticles and substrate under defined reaction conditions. Before adding biomass, nanoparticles were sonicated in distilled water to obtain a homogeneous solution. After the addition of biomass and H2O2, the mixture was kept in a shaking incubator at 25 °C and 200 rpm. Samples were withdrawn after a fixed time interval followed by solid–liquid separation. The solid biomass after solid–liquid separation was dried overnight at 60 °C. The dried biomass was further used for residual lignin or final lignin estimation through the iodometric method. The percent delignification in the treated biomass was calculated according to the formula given in eqn (3). (3)
Effect of different process parameters on lignin degradation
Three different types of nanoparticles (FeONPs, CeONPs, and Ce-FeONPs) were chosen to study their effects on lignin degradation of corn cob biomass. Based on the peroxidase study, initial process parameters were taken as the incubation time (1–30 h), nanoparticle concentration (1–10 g L−1), solid loading (5–30%, w/v), and H2O2 concentration (0.1–1 M). It was observed that nanoparticles tend to settle down faster at 50 °C compared to 25 °C. As a result, it was difficult to separate the nanoparticles from the biomass after the experiment at 50 °C (Fig. S5†) and further reuse. Hence, the effect of temperature on delignification was not studied in this work. A control experiment using only H2O2 was also conducted.
Phenolic content estimation at regular time intervals
The quantification of the total phenolic content of the delignified liquid obtained after the delignification process at regular time intervals was done through the Folin–Ciocalteau colorimetric method.36 Folin–Ciocalteau reagent (1 mL) was taken in a clean and dry test tube and 0.2 mL of extract and 0.8 mL of Na2CO3 (7.5%) were added and mixed. Thereafter, distilled water (7 mL) was added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Absorbance of the sample was taken at 765 nm in a spectrophotometer. Standard solution was prepared with a gallic acid equivalent.
Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) profiling of lignin degraded intermediates
Lignin degradation from the biomass was carried out with magnetic Ce-FeONPs. The delignified or pretreated biomass was collected at specific time intervals and subsequently solid–liquid separation was carried out. The obtained liquid was oven dried at 60 °C to remove moisture. The solid residue recovered after oven drying was derivatized by mixing N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and acetonitrile at a 1:1 ratio. Thereafter, the derivatized sample was transferred to 2 mL vials and incubated at 70 °C for 1 h and filtered through a membrane filter. The filtered sample was used for identification of lignin degradation products. Analysis of lignin degradation products was performed through an Agilent 6890/5973i GC equipped with a mass selective detector. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1, while an HP-5 MS capillary column was employed for the separation of the degraded lignin products. The oven temperature was initially set at 50 °C for 1 min and was increased to 100 °C at a rate of 2.5 °C min−1. Further, the oven temperature was increased to 180 °C at a rate of 2 °C min−1, followed by an increase to 220 °C at a rate of 15 °C min−1 with a total run time of 63.60 min. The identification of the lignin degradation products was carried out according to the retention time retrieved from the inbuilt library of the GC-MS data system.37 The relative composition of the identified compounds was determined based on the area percentage.
Structural characterization of raw and delignified biomass
The changes in the surface architecture or morphology of the pretreated and raw biomass were analyzed through field radiation SEM II (Model: Ultra Plus). Dried biomass was taken in a metallic stub or tail end and images were recorded accordingly. FTIR was performed for raw and pretreated biomass to probe into the stretching vibrations, band intensities, absorption peaks, and functional groups that constitute lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose structures. The KBr pellet technique was used to obtain the spectra using an FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) over the range of 400–4000 cm−1 at a spectral resolution of 0.5 cm−1.38 X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out to determine the degree of cellulose crystallinity for raw and pretreated corn cob biomass using a high power X-ray diffractometer (Model: JP/SmartLab, 9 kW). The samples were analyzed from 2θ = 5 to 70° with a scanning speed of 3° min−1. The crystallinity index (CrI) was calculated as [(I002 − Iam)/I002] where I002 represents the maximum crystalline intensity peak at 2θ between 22° and 23° for cellulose I, whereas Iam stands for the minimum crystalline intensity peak at 2θ between 18° and 19° for amorphous cellulose.39 Biomass porosity in terms of specific surface area, pore size, and pore volume of the raw and pretreated corn cob biomass was analyzed through specific surface area and pore analysis apparatus (Model: ASAP 2020, AutoChem II). The raw and pretreated samples were placed in the degassing module and subsequently vacuum degassed at room temperature for 3 h prior to analysis. The surface area of the biomass was calculated following the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, whereas the pore diameter and volume were estimated according to the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.40,41
Enzymatic hydrolysis of delignified corn cob biomass
Hydrolysis of both Ce-FeONP treated and untreated corn cob biomass (control) samples at a concentration of 50 g L−1 was carried out in a 250 ml conical flask containing 50 ml citrate buffer (50 mM, pH 5.5) and different concentrations of enzymes, i.e. 10 filter paper units (FPU) and 20 FPU per g of substrate. The hydrolysis reaction was conducted at 50 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Samples were removed at regular time intervals and analyzed to determine glucose, xylose, and total reducing sugar concentrations after hydrolysis up to 48 h.
Analytical methods for sugar estimation
The concentration of released sugar, i.e. glucose and xylose obtained after hydrolysis, was determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, YL 9100, Young-Lin, Inc., Korea). Samples used for HPLC analysis were centrifuged and filtered through 0.2 μm filters. Each sample was injected into a Bio-Rad Aminex hpx-87h column at 65 °C with a refractive index detector and was eluted from the column using a mobile phase of 5 mM H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.6 ml min−1.42 Total reducing sugar concentration was analyzed using the DNS method.31
Nanoparticle recovery
Nanoparticles were recovered from the reaction mixture using sonication and Buchner filtration with Whatman filter paper, and then washed with deionized water. After recovery, the powdered nanoparticles were centrifuged, freeze-dried, and reused for the delignification process.
Results and discussion
Compositional analysis of raw biomass
Lignocellulosic biomass, which serves as a potential feedstock for biofuel production, depends primarily on carbohydrate composition in terms of cellulose and hemicellulose content. The raw corn cob biomass used in this study contained large amounts of cellulose (38.69%, w/w) and hemicellulose (32.14%, w/w). The lignin content of the biomass was found to be 12.40%, w/w, which necessitates an effective delignification methodology for degradation or removal of lignin and exposure of cellulose and hemicellulose moieties. In addition, the lignin content of 14.28%, w/w was determined according to the NREL methodology. Cellulose and hemicellulose can be further utilized for fermentable sugar production and in turn bioethanol generation. Standard AOAC protocols were carried out to calculate moisture (6.9%, w/w) and ash content (10%, w/w) of corn cob biomass.
Characterization of synthesized nanoparticles
The FTIR spectra of CeONPs, FeONPs, and Ce-FeONPs are depicted in Fig. 1a. In the FTIR spectra of CeONPs, the peaks at 3409 cm−1 and 1635 cm−1 correspond to the –OH, –NH stretching and amide CO group, respectively, which confirms the conjugation of the nanoparticles with chitosan. The peak at 1535 cm−1 represents the N–H bending of chitosan. The formation of the Ce–O group in the nanoparticles can be confirmed from the peak at 424 cm−1.32 TEM images (ESI, Fig. S1a†) of the synthesized CeONPs showed that nanoparticles are monodisperse and in uniform spherical shape with an average size of 45 nm. Elemental compositions of CeONPs are shown in Fig. S1b.† The peak at 4.8 keV specifies the presence of cerium in nanoparticles, while the carbon and oxygen peaks represent chitosan coating. However, the presence of carbon and oxygen hinders the precise estimation of cerium and oxygen in the dried nanoparticles. The surface oxidation of CeONPs was further studied using XPS analysis. The peaks at 897.5 and 916.23 eV correspond to Ce(IV) 3d94f0O2p6, whereas the peaks at 882.18 and 901.10 eV are attributed to Ce(IV) 3d94f2O2p4.32–34 However, the peaks at 886.18 and 904.9 eV can be assigned to Ce(III) 3d94f2O2p5, which indicates the formation of mixed valences in the nanoparticles.43–45 The peaks representing Ce4+ are more intense than those of Ce3+, which further confirmed the formation of cerium oxide (CeO2).

The formation of Fe–O in the nanoparticle structure can be verified from the characteristic peak at 590 cm−1 (Fig. 1a). The peaks at 3440 cm−1, 2927 cm−1, and 1754 cm−1 correspond to –OH stretching, –CH stretching, and –CO groups, respectively. The EDS spectrum in Fig. S2b† of the synthesized FeONPs reveals the presence of iron peaks in three different areas at 0.7, 6.4, and 7.2 keV. The formation of FeONPs can be confirmed by the presence of oxygen peaks in the spectrum. The produced FeONPs are spherical in shape with an average size of 8–10 nm (Fig. S2a†).
The FTIR spectrum of Ce-FeONPs (Fig. 1a) showed characteristic peaks at 416 cm−1 and 586 cm−1 corresponding to Ce–O and Fe–O groups, respectively. The peak at 1619 cm−1 and the broad band at 3402 cm−1 suggest the presence of water molecules on the surface of Ce-FeONPs. This is because the nanoparticle surface is covered with hydroxyl groups due to the use of a chemical co-precipitation method.33 The elemental composition of the nanoparticles can be obtained from EDS analysis as shown in Fig. 1b. It can be corroborated that the nanoparticles consist of both cerium and iron, but the mass percentage of cerium is less compared to iron. The TEM image (Fig. 1c) illustrates that the obtained nanoparticles are in rectangular shape with a size range of 6–13 nm. However, it also suggests that the agglomeration persists due to the magnetic properties of iron oxide. As shown in Fig. 1d, the SEM image of Ce-FeONPs exhibited a change in surface configuration compared to CeONPs (Fig. S3a†) and FeONPs (Fig. S3b†) because of doping of cerium with iron. The magnetic properties of the synthesized nanoparticles are shown in Fig. S4a.† With the doping of cerium, iron oxide still retained its ferromagnetic properties, which is beneficial for lignin degradation. The XPS spectrum indicates the presence of elements such as Fe 2p, Ce 3d, and O 1s oxidation states (Fig. 2a). The deconvolution analysis of the obtained raw data was used to determine all species and their oxidation states in the nanoparticle structure. Nonetheless, the peaks observed in the Ce 3d spectrum are similar to those in the CeONP XPS spectrum, suggesting the formation of Ce4+ and Ce3+ in the nanoparticles (Fig. 2b).34 The XPS spectrum of the Fe 2p core level illustrates the peaks of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 at 711.1 eV, 713.3, and 724.5 eV, which are ascribed to the Fe3+ state. Fe 2p3/2 does not have a satellite peak at 716 eV, which further corroborates the formation of Fe3O4 in the present study (Fig. 2c). The peaks at binding energies of 711.1 and 724.5 eV represent octahedral Fe3+ species, whereas tetrahedral Fe3+ displayed a peak at 713.3 eV.45,46 The peak around 531.09 eV is attributed to the oxygen atoms (O2−) associated with Fe, whereas the peak at 528.96 eV is related to the oxygen present in the cerium oxide lattice (Fig. 2d).34

Peroxidase assay of nanoparticles
The enzyme mimicking peroxidase assay of the synthesized nanoparticles is depicted in Fig. S4b and S4c.† The presence of oxidized TMB in the mixture was indicated by the absorbance peak at 652 nm and the color change (colorless to blue). Little color change was observed in TMB in the absence of a catalyst, suggesting that H2O2 alone did not oxidize TMB. Without the addition of H2O2, CeONPs showed color change to blue in the presence of TMB, whereas no such alteration was observed for FeONPs and Ce-FeONPs. It is well known that CeONPs have a higher affinity for TMB than H2O2 due to their oxidase properties.33,47,48 Furthermore, previous studies indicated that the presence of Ce4+ exhibited higher oxidase activity than Ce3+.44 XPS study showed that Ce4+ is more intense than Ce3+ on the surface of the nanoparticles, which contributes to higher oxidase activity. A higher concentration of H2O2 inhibited oxidase activity as indicated by a decrease in absorbance and a color change from blue to green as shown in Fig. S4b.† A plausible explanation for this could be the dissociation of H2O2 to a perhydroxy radical under acidic conditions. The generated radical further converted Ce4+ to Ce3+ as indicated from eqn (4) and (5).43,49 H2O2 → HO2˙ + H+ + e−(4) Ce4+ + HO2˙ → Ce3+ + H+ + O2(5)
On the other hand, as mentioned above, FeONPs did not show any color change of TMB without H2O2, suggesting that FeONPs have no oxidase activity (Fig. S4c†). The addition of H2O2 changed the color of the solution from colorless to blue, demonstrating that the synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles have peroxidase activity. The reaction mechanism of peroxidase activity was reported to be similar to Fenton chemistry with iron ion or chelate50 and is shown in eqn (6)–(8). FeONPs follow the ping pong mechanism. Initially, they bind and react with H2O2 to generate hydroxyl free radicals (˙OH) as an intermediate state, and then capture H+ generated from TMB that led to its oxidation (TMBox) and color change to blue. Furthermore, active sites are present on the surface of FeONPs, showing high peroxidase activity. EDS study showed that iron is present as Fe3+ on the nanoparticle surface, contributing to high peroxidase activity.51 Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + HO˙ + OH−(6) Fe3+ + H2O2 → Fe2+ + HO2˙ + H+(7) 2H2O2 → HO˙ + HO2˙ + H2O(8)
The EDS spectra of Ce-FeONPs (Fig. 1b) showed a very low mass percentage of cerium compared to iron, resulting in a poor oxidase activity when reacting with TMB alone. After adding H2O2 to the Ce-FeONPs and TMB mixture, color change and an increase in absorbance were observed (Fig. S4a and S4b†). Doping FeONPs with 5% Ce showed higher peroxidase activity than FeONPs, which is similar to a previous study (Fig. S4b†).35 It seems that the combination of two catalytic metals resulted in enhanced hydroxyl radical generation as in the Fenton reaction. Thus, this improved peroxidase activity of the synthesized nanoparticles is the main characteristic that was employed for lignin degradation (eqn (9) and (10)). (9) (10)where A represents guaiacyl, syringyl, and para-hydroxyphenol units of lignin.
Lignin degradation study with respect to different process parameters
Initially, three different types of nanoparticles (FeONPs, CeONPs, and Ce-FeONPs) with and without H2O2 were screened to study their effects on lignin degradation with respect to incubation time (1–30 h) at time intervals of 6 h. It was observed that among all treatments, nanoparticles with H2O2 resulted in higher lignin degradation. Delignification of 25% was obtained using cerium doped iron oxide nanoparticles (Ce-FeO-H2O2) within 24 h. Doping of metals or metal ions (cerium, zinc, and cobalt) into the matrix of iron oxide or chloride increases the availability of its surface sites that subsequently enhance the adsorption capacity of iron oxides and in turn peroxidase activity.34,52,53 In addition to the doping phenomena, H2O2 due to free radical generation increases the peroxidase activity of nanoparticles. The other parameters fixed during the experiment were H2O2 concentration (0.1 M), solid loading (15%, w/v), and nanoparticle concentration (2 g L−1). However, delignification (25%) did not increase significantly with increasing incubation time up to 30 h (Fig. 3a). Improved delignification (58%) was observed within 4 h from wheat straw residues using graphene-based zinc oxide nanoparticles together with a photocatalytic (UV/iodide) process.54 Similarly, the current approach of nanoparticle mediated lignin depolymerization when integrated with other physical or chemical modes of lignin degradation might further help in maximizing the degradation of lignin. Based on these results, treatments involving nanoparticles without H2O2 were not considered for further lignin degradation studies due to their non-significant effect on lignin degradation.

Because of its ability to generate free radicals, H2O2 is believed to play an important role in the deconstruction of lignin. In addition, free radical generation is dependent on the concentration of H2O2. In the present study, H2O2 concentration was varied from 0.1 to 1.0 M. Other parameters fixed during the experiment were incubation time (24 h), solid loading (15%, w/v), and nanoparticle concentration (2 g L−1). For doped nanoparticles (Ce-FeO-H2O2), a H2O2 concentration of 0.75 M was observed to result in substantial delignification (32.6%) compared to undoped nanoparticles (CeO and FeO). No significant increase in lignin degradation was observed at a higher concentration of H2O2 (Fig. 3b). This is consistent with the report that biomass (reed stem and rice straw) pretreatment did not improve enzyme digestibility for fermentable sugar production when increasing the concentration of H2O2 with undoped nanoparticles.55 Moreover, low concentrations of H2O2 can minimize the loss of cellulose content from biomass.56 It was also reported that low concentrations of alkaline hydrogen peroxide during pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse and corn stover degrade maximum lignin and hemicellulose while improving biomass digestibility. Alkaline hydrogen peroxide treatment increases process efficiency by lowering the enzyme loading for biomass saccharification.57,58
The economic viability of any process largely depends on solid loading because it determines the amounts of solid to be employed in the conversion process. It also helps to reduce wastewater treatment and distillation costs, as well as minimizes water usage.59 Thus, solid loading in different ranges (5–30%, w/v) was chosen to study its effect on lignin degradation (Fig. 3c). Other parameters fixed during the experiment were incubation time (24 h), H2O2 concentration (0.75 M), and nanoparticle concentration (2 g L−1). Maximum delignification (35%) was recorded at 20% (w/v) solid loading for doped nanoparticles (Ce-FeO-H2O2). Moreover, reduced delignification was observed at higher solid loading that could be due to increased viscosity. In the case of ionic liquid [Emim][OAc] pretreated corn stover, at high solid loading (33%, w/w), only 15% of lignin was removed and lignin degradation was not significantly improved above 33% loading.60 A similar result was observed where 31.19% delignification was reported at high corn stover loading (36%) upon utilizing 10% ethylenediamine with no significant increase in lignin degradation at high solid loadings.61 Moreover, at high solid loadings, 65% lignin removal was observed from anhydrous ammonia pretreated corn stover when subjected to NaOH treatment.62 In another study, when ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate) was used for wheat straw pretreatment at an initial biomass loading of 0.05% and 140 °C, the lignin rich fraction gradually decreased from 10% to 7%.63 In addition, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulphate was utilized for the pretreatment of wheat straw. The pretreatment reaction was carried out at 10 wt% of dry biomass, and delignification resulted in a decrease in the lignin content of the retained solid biomass. The solid biomass was subjected to lignin extraction prior to enzymatic hydrolysis and the extracted lignin was transformed into various aromatic compounds.64 The current process at a high solid loading of 20% (w/v) under mild conditions resulted in 35% delignification of biomass.
Nanoparticles due to their high surface area to volume ratio and unique enzyme mimicking properties are believed to play a significant role in the oxidation/reduction processes. In this regard, the effect of nanoparticle concentration for performing the lignin degradation reaction was studied. Nanoparticle concentrations were varied in different ranges (1–10 g L−1) with other parameters fixed at incubation time (24 h), H2O2 concentration (0.75 M), and solid loading (20%, w/v) (Fig. 3d). Higher delignification (44%) was observed in Ce-FeONPs at a concentration of 4 g L−1 compared to CeONPs and FeONPs. However, no significant increase in lignin degradation was noted when increasing the concentration of Ce-FeONPs to 10 g L−1. This is consistent with the report that further increase in nanoparticle (iron oxide) concentration does not enhance the enzymatic digestibility of rice and reed stem biomass for fermentable sugar production.55 Moreover, at higher concentrations, nanoparticles are difficult to disperse in water due to their ferromagnetic properties (FeO and Ce-FeO) and the process involves a lot of washing steps for further saccharification of the pretreated biomass. Overall, higher concentrations of nanoparticles for pretreatment do not appear to be feasible on an industrial scale. The best conditions leading to maximum delignification were the incubation time of 24 h, H2O2 concentration of 0.75 M, solid loading of 20% (w/v), and the nanoparticle concentration of 4 g L−1. A control experiment was also carried out using H2O2 only under the best conditions, and no delignification was observed, further signifying the role of nanoparticles in the process. No further optimization of the process is required since the total degradation of lignin in the lignocellulosic biomass is not necessary to achieve increased biomass digestibility. It is known that 20–65% delignification is sufficient to improve the release of fermented sugars from pretreated biomass.65
The mass balance of the nanoparticle mediated delignification process and enzymatic saccharification along with the composition of the obtained biomass and liquid are summarized in Fig. 4 to develop a clear overview of the entire process. On 6 g (dry weight) basis of raw biomass, approximately 5.34 g of pretreated solids were recovered which contained 41.47% cellulose, 28.20% hemicellulose, and 6.94% residual lignin. The pretreated liquid recovered after biomass delignification was around 80%. The reduced lignin content of the pretreated biomass contributes to 44% delignification. The solid mass loss in the process incurred was 0.66 g. The pretreated solid at 50 g L−1 biomass loading upon enzymatic hydrolysis for 24 h incubation resulted in glucose (18.1 g L−1) and xylose (9.12 g L−1) production. During pretreatment, a small amount of hemicellulose was lost and some of the xylan from hemicellulose was degraded into xylose. The amount of xylose in terms of the relative composition in the pretreated liquid was observed to be 9.64% through the GC-MS study. If this amount of xylose (9.64%) is available after the pretreatment process (without being lost in pretreatment), it may improve the overall conversion of biomass into reducing sugars. More conversion of xylan into xylose might be observed if the lost xylan is available for the saccahrification process.
 Fig. 4  Overall mass balance of nanoparticle mediated pretreatment and enzymatic saccharification of corn cob biomass. 
Quantification of phenolic content
The phenolic content of a pretreated or delignified liquid represents the quantity of phenolics present in the treated liquid equivalent to gallic acid. It is worth mentioning that plant biomass such as corn cob is a lignin-rich biomass, which results in the release of an array of plant phenolics by nanoparticle mediated deconstruction. It was observed that as the incubation time increases, the concentration of phenolic content, which indicates the breakdown of lignin, gradually increased during the process of nanoparticle mediated delignification of corn cob biomass (Table 1). A high yield of phenolics was observed from microwave-assisted pyrolysis of Douglas fir upon increasing the reaction time to 8 min.66 This indicates a trend of enhanced release of phenolic content upon increasing the incubation time with respect to different lignin degradation strategies.

Biochemical composition analysis of corn cob before and after nanoparticle mediated delignification
The composition of raw and delignified corn cob biomass in terms of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose is depicted in Table 2. The lignin content of the biomass decreased significantly after pretreatment with nanoparticles (1.78 times), while a slight decrease in hemicellulose content was observed in delignified or pretreated corn cob. The cellulose content of delignified biomass was 1.07 times higher than that of raw corn cob (Table 2). These changes in biochemical composition illustrate the action of nanoparticles on corn cob biomass during delignification. Such type of biomass composition before and after pretreatment was also reported in enzyme pretreated lignocellulosics such as Aloe vera leaf rind, Kans grass, and a mixture of lignocellulosics.67–69 In addition, reducing sugar content in the pretreated liquid was found to be 23.71 g L−1, which can be due to the loss of hemicellulose moieties. The loss of reducing sugars in the pretreated liquid further might be minimized through simultaneous pretreatment and saccharification of lignocellulosics, after which the reducing sugars obtained directly are utilized for ethanol generation.

Identification of lignin degraded intermediates through GC-MS
Delignification of corn cob biomass was carried out using Ce-FeONPs, resulting in a specific cleavage of Cα–Cβ, Cα oxidation, β-ether linkage, aryl Cα bond, aromatic ring opening, and demethylation in lignin moieties that release different types of degradation products. It is important to minimize the production of unnecessary degradation intermediates by limiting side reactions. Thus, subsequent work was carried out to identify different lignin degraded compounds. Several physical and physicochemical methods have already been reported and are currently being used for delignification of various lignocellulosics. The major limitations of such methods include non-target specificity, degradation of carbohydrate moieties, and production of toxic compounds such as furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural, and acetic acid along with lignin degradation.70,71 The effectiveness of the nanoparticle mediated delignification method can be suitably illustrated by the GC-MS technique to analyze low molecular weight lignin degraded compounds. Table 3 lists different types of lignin degraded compounds at various retention times with their relative composition by area percentage, which proved to serve as natural mediators instead of limiting the degradation process.72 A similar kind of characterization of microwave pretreated Aloe vera rind biomass was carried out utilizing GC-MS that focused on relative biomass composition by area percentage.67 The major degraded products were organic compounds. Different low molecular weight compounds such as 4-methylquinoline (RT 5.72), 2(3H)-furanone (RT 9.186), xylitol (RT 13.53), etc. were identified as a result of lignin degradation by Ce-FeONPs. These aromatic compounds identified after lignin degradation can be linked to the oxidation of sinapyl, coniferyl, and p-coumaroyl alcohols which are considered to be the basic units that build the lignin molecules. The relative composition of these compounds was 1.18% for 4-methylquinoline, 0.04% for 2(3H)-furanone, and 3.03% for xylitol. Besides different forms of aromatic alcohols, several other phenolics and other acid type compounds such as cinnamic acid (RT 8.442, involved in connecting lignin and the hemicellulose moiety), propanoic acid (RT 4.695), benzoic acid (RT 7.993), maleic acid (RT 10.690), succinic acid (RT 16.46), etc. were also identified. The relative composition of these compounds was 0.87% for cinnamic acid, 0.41% for propanoic acid, 0.10% for benzoic acid, 1.76% for maleic acid, and 0.66% for succinic acid. These types of low molecular weight acidic compounds were identified during microbial degradation of Kraft lignin.73 Among aldehydes, benzaldehyde (RT 16.837 and composition 0.08%) and 3-bromo-5-ethoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (RT 21.470 and composition 1.17%) were identified. The composition of the lignin degraded products mentioned above indicates their relative quantification upon nanoparticle mediated delignification of corn cob biomass.

Due to its polyphenolic aromatic structure and high energy density, lignin is considered a valuable renewable feedstock that can be utilized in advanced modern biorefinery for the production of fine chemicals, fuels, and functional materials.74 The most prominent lignin utilization to date appears to be its depolymerization into lower molecular weight compounds such as aromatic alcohols, acidic compounds, and aldehydes with high commercial prospects due to their immense applications in the aroma and perfume industries.75 Moreover, lignin degraded products such as 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, 2-butenedioic acid, and octadecanoic acid act as major constituents of fuel diesel (fatty acid methyl esters) produced from different types of feedstocks.76 Apart from these degraded compounds, the remaining intact lignin present in the pretreated biomass holds good potential for liquid and gaseous fuel production. The remaining lignin can be extracted from pretreated biomass through suitable solvents (Kraft, soda, and Klason lignin).75 The extracted lignin can be further used to produce syngas through gasification, which in turn can produce methanol and other chemicals. In addition, bio-oil can be produced by pyrolysis of lignin treated in a solvent at high temperature and pressure. However, most of the extracted lignin is employed as a low-grade boiler fuel to impart heat and power to the process.77 Some compounds not produced in the initial stages of delignification were observed in the later stages that authenticated the process of lignin degradation. An overall schematic representation for lignin degradation by Ce-FeONPs is given in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Lignin degradation by cerium doped iron oxide nanoparticles. 
SEM and FTIR analysis
The surface architecture of the raw and delignified corn cob biomass was examined through an SEM study. Fig. S6a† depicts the intact surface morphology of raw corn cob biomass, while Fig. S6b† clearly shows an increase in surface distortion in terms of cracks and pores indicating removal of cell wall materials, specifically lignin, which can result in the exposure of buried cellulose microfibrils. A similar kind of surface architecture was reported in the case of alkali (NaOH) and enzyme treated sweet sorghum straw and Bambusa bambos.78,79
FTIR spectroscopic analysis of the pretreated corn cob biomass showed a reduction in the absorption peak at 1637 cm−1, indicating the loss of hemicellulose (CO group), which is in accordance with the biochemical composition analysis. The decrease in the characteristic peaks of aromatic skeleton vibration and syringyl ring breathing at 1513 cm−1 and 1250 cm−1, respectively, for pretreated corn cob also indicated the loss of lignin due to the action of nanoparticles (Fig. S7†). Moreover, the absorption peaks at 1047 cm−1 and 1378 cm−1 for raw and pretreated corn cob corresponding to the C–O–C and C–OH of cellulose did not show much alteration. In addition, absorption peaks at 2921 cm−1 and 3417 cm−1 represented C–H stretching in CH3 groups and broad O–H stretching groups. Such type of decrease in absorption peaks and stretching in functional groups were observed in an enzyme treated mixture of lignocellulosics and pineapple leaf waste.69,80 Thus, it can be inferred that the delignification process resulted in less altered biological molecules such as cellulose and hemicellulose, which can be further utilized for the generation of fermentable sugars.
XRD analysis
The crystallinity of cellulose is believed to play a critical role in lignocellulosic digestibility in terms of its conversion to fermentable sugars. Cellulose in biomass was found to be present in amorphous and crystalline forms. The amorphous form is characterized by the presence of more disordered cellulosic chains and thus its hydrolysis occurs rapidly compared to the compact form of crystalline cellulose. To determine the effect of delignification or pretreatment, the crystallinity index (CrI), which represents the total crystallinity in the biomass, was measured by wide angle X-ray diffraction. The CrI to cellulose ratio signifies a valid relative measure that accounts for the effect of delignification on the crystallinity of cellulose itself.81 The value of CrI increased from 0.39 to 0.46 by delignification (Table 4). This is in accordance with the report where the CrI of straw was enhanced from 0.49 to 0.63 upon NaOH and autohydrolysis pretreatments.81 Similarly, the ratio of CrI to cellulose showed an increasing trend from 1.00 to 1.18. This suggests that the total crystallinity in the biomass increased due to the increased cellulose content, while the increase in the crystallinity of cellulose itself was lower after pretreatment.82

The cellulose features of the treated biomass showed an increase in the crystallinity index compared to the control after pretreatment because of the decomposition of wall polymers, i.e. lignin and hemicellulose due to the dissociation of hydrogen bonds between polymers. Moreover, a minimal relative % increase in cellulose crystallinity (1.18) was recorded for pretreated biomass, which may contribute to accelerating the biomass digestibility or saccharification process. This is consistent with the results where the energy crops such as Miscanthus and rapeseed stalks were utilized for bioethanol production that showed lignocellulose modifications such as an increase in cellulose crystallinity and the degree of polymerization of cellulose after alkaline pretreatment.83,84
Surface area, pore volume, and pore size estimation
The texture of the substrate also serves as a primary indicator of biomass digestibility. The texture of the biomass further depends on its surface area, pore size, and pore volume. The surface area, pore size, and pore volume of corn cob biomass before and after nanoparticle mediated pretreatment were estimated through BET and BJH methods and are shown in Table 5. The pore size of the pretreated biomass increased to 30.90 nm compared to the raw biomass (18.97 nm). In general, small pores are not easily accessible by hydrolytic enzymes, whereas enzyme diffusion through large pores substantially increases the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose.85 It has also been suggested that, through well-defined staining techniques, small pore sizes should not be suitable for cellulase loading and accessibility.86 The large pore size of the pretreated substrate was indeed observed in the present study compared to the raw substrate. An increase in the surface area (1.48 m2 g−1) in delignified corn cob was recorded compared to untreated biomass (0.59 m2 g−1). The total pore volume of the pretreated biomass increased (0.0049 mL g−1) compared to the raw biomass (0.0028 mL g−1). The values represented in Table 5 indicate that the deconstruction of corn cob using nanoparticles significantly increased biomass porosity. Furthermore, it has been reported that the degradation of wall polymers such as lignin and hemicellulose can improve the porosity of biomass, ultimately increasing the cellulase loading rate and accessibility to the cellulose surface.87,88 This is in line with the reported results where an increasing trend of surface area and pore volume was observed in the case of NaOH pretreated Miscanthus biomass and CaO pretreated rapeseed stalks.83,84 The increase in biomass porosity in terms of surface area, pore size, and pore volume further enhances the accessibility of hydrolytic enzymes towards pretreated biomass for fermentable sugar generation.89

Enzymatic saccharification of delignified corn cob biomass samples
Enzymatic hydrolysis experiments were conducted to assess the saccharification of both delignified corn cob biomass and an untreated sample (control) at a concentration of 50 g L−1 using in-house cellulase and hemicellulase enzyme preparations derived from the isolated fungal strain. Optimum hydrolysis was obtained after 24 h of saccharification at 50 °C with shaking for both the 10 and 20 FPU enzyme (per g substrate) concentrations used for hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of the untreated corn cob biomass showed a negligible amount of sugar release. As depicted in Fig. 5a, in the case of delignified corn cob biomass hydrolysis using 10 FPU enzyme per g substrate, 12.5 g L−1 glucose and 6.99 g L−1 xylose were generated after 24 h saccharification using a mixture of cellulase and hemicellulase produced by the isolated fungal strain. When 20 FPU enzyme per g substrate was used to hydrolyze the delignified corn cob biomass, a significant improvement in hydrolysis was observed, releasing up to 18.1 g L−1 glucose and 9.12 g L−1 xylose after 24 h (Fig. 5b). A higher concentration of total reducing sugar was obtained after the hydrolysis of delignified corn cob biomass using 20 FPU enzyme per g substrate (46.6 g L−1) compared to 10 FPU enzyme per g substrate (34.5 g L−1) (Fig. 5a and b).

Several studies have been reported on the pretreatment of biomass materials using nanomaterials for bioethanol fermentation. Recently, pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse using two different acid-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (500 mg g−1 bagasse) demonstrated sugar releases of up to 18.67–18.83 g L−1.90 Moreover, it was reported that two different acid-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles utilized in the pretreatment of wheat straw generated higher amounts of oligosaccharides (∼41–45%) compared to the control.91 In our present study, the maximum enzymatic hydrolysis (18.1 g L−1 glucose and 9.12 g L−1 xylose) of Ce-FeONP-H2O2 treated delignified corn cob biomass indicates that both cellulose and hemicellulose fractions were depolymerized into glucose and xylose sugars, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of pretreatment of corn cob biomass using Ce-FeONPs and further enzymatic depolymerization of cellulose and hemicellulose fractions into simple monomers. These simple sugars can be further converted to produce value-added products such as biochemicals and biofuels.
Recovery of nanoparticles
In addition to the potential enzyme mimicking peroxidase activity of Ce-FeONPs that degrades lignin from biomass, the magnetic properties of nanoparticles add another benefit of easy separation from the reaction mixture. The recovery and reuse of Ce-FeONPs was examined through three sequential runs with the recovered nanoparticles. It was observed from Fig. 6a that the synthesized doped nanoparticles are attached to the surface of biomass, which can be easily recovered through sonication and subsequent washing (3 times). As shown in Fig. 6b, the percentage of lignin degradation in corn cob pretreated with recovered Ce-FeONP-H2O2 was 37.1% in the second run and 30.8% in the third run.
 Fig. 6  (a) Images of biomass after nanoparticle treatment and washing, (b) reuse of the recovered catalyst (Ce-FeO-H2O2) and its effect on lignin degradation. 
The recovery of the nanoparticles was almost 50% of the initial concentration, and some of the nanoparticles were lost during the solid–liquid separation process. After each recycle run, the recovery of the used nanoparticles was found to be low, which could reduce activity due to the deposition of lignin degraded byproducts on the surface of nanoparticles. The TEM image of the recovered catalyst after biomass pretreatment (Fig. S8a†) showed no distinct changes in morphology and particle size (6–10 nm) compared to the initial untreated nanoparticles (Fig. 1c). On the other hand, the SEM image of the treated nanoparticles (Fig. S8b†) showed that some agglomeration occurred after pretreatment, which can reduce delignification subsequently. Thus, the results obtained demonstrate the feasibility of the recovered catalyst in terms of further reuse for lignin degradation with the addition of fresh nanoparticles.
Conclusion
A novel biomass pretreatment strategy was developed by harnessing the enzyme mimicking characteristics of cerium doped iron oxide nanoparticles. The present work dealt with the synthesis and characterization of nanoparticles and their application in lignin degradation. The advantage of this technique is to selectively degrade the lignin moieties without hampering the energy-rich carbohydrate compounds that can be used for fermentable sugar generation and in turn for ethanol production. The basic phenomenon of this approach is a Fenton-like process where free radical generation increases the peroxidase activity of the nanoparticles subsequently utilized for lignin deconstruction. Maximum lignin degradation from corn cob biomass was recorded to be 44% using Ce-FeONPs under the best conditions. Lignin degradation study was probed through GC-MS analysis where lignin degradation products increased at regular time intervals, which was also evident through phenolic content estimation. The efficacy of the degradation process was further confirmed through various structural characterization techniques. SEM and FTIR data showed surface distortion and unaltered chemical structures in pretreated biomass. XRD analysis illustrated total increase in biomass crystallinity while the cellulose crystallinity itself was found to be low after pretreatment. Biomass porosity analysis indicated the improvement in biomass pore surface area, size, and volume when treated with nanoparticles compared to intact or raw biomass. In addition, biomass digestibility in terms of enhanced release of fermentable sugars indicates the viability of the pretreatment process. As the process conditions are mild in nature, this eco-friendly technique can provide a feasible route for lignin depolymerization from lignocellulosic biomass and subsequently enhanced production of reducing sugars.
