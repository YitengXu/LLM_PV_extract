    , Accepted 5th January 2014First published on 9th January 2014AbstractHighly dense and well-defined TiO2 nanoflowers (NFs) were grown by the hydrothermal process on a titanium (Ti) coated FTO substrate. The Ti layer with a thickness of ~500–600 nm was deposited on FTO at room temperature with a pressure of ~5 mTorr using a Ti-source through RF magnetic sputtering. The unique TiO2 NF thin film substrate was applied as a photoanode for the fabrication of a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSCs). Each NF was made of uniform clover leaf-like petals of an average diameter of ~80–100 nm. The synthesized TiO2 NFs possessed a pure anatase phase with good crystal quality. The fabricated DSSC with TiO2 NF thin film photoanode accomplished a reasonably good overall solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of ~3.64% with a high short circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of ~9.6 mA cm−2. The improved performance and photocurrent density were explained by the charge transport time, diffusion coefficient, diffusion length and charge collection efficiency of the fabricated DSSC.
Introduction
The growing demands for a clean environment and energy require alternative renewable energy sources at low costs, such as solar conversion energy. Among conventional photovoltaic devices, DSSCs are gaining attention as promising alternative photovoltaic devices to p-n junction solar cells1,2 owing to their low manufacturing cost with a reasonably high solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency. Traditionally, a DSSC is a sandwiched structure of a Ru-dye absorbed semiconducting metal oxide based photoelectrode, a platinum (Pt) layer based counter electrode and a redox electrolyte as a charge transport layer.3 DSSCs fabricated with a modified porphyrin as a sensitizer and an electrolyte based on cobalt(II/III) complexes have reached efficiencies of ~12.3%, as reported in a pioneer work of Gratzel's group.4 However, a high performance DSSC is still needed to overcome several issues, such as stability,5 price,6 electron collection efficiency7 and optical properties. Furthermore, the back recombination reactions of the photo-injected electrons on the photoanode with the holes of the tri-iodide ions in the redox electrolyte is the main issue to resolve in order to achieve a high performance DSSC with a high photocurrent.8 Several efforts have been made to advance the conversion efficiency of DSSCs by controlling the structural architectures of the photoanode.9
The nanostructures of titania (TiO2) are highly explored metal oxide semiconductors, exhibiting exotic structural, optical and inert surface properties.10 Ordered TiO2 nanostructures, such as nanorods, nanowires or nanotubes, have recently received a great deal of attention due to their unique morphology, high surface-to-volume ratio and optical properties.11–13 These TiO2 nanostructures could be potential photoanodes to improve the collection of charges and minimize the recombination at the grain boundaries. By adopting these nanomaterials, faster transport and slower recombination could be achieved to minimize the charge losses at the external circuit. In this regard, intensive research is devoted to controllable TiO2 nanostructures using various methods like sol–gel, hydrothermal, sonochemical and thermal vapor deposition.14–16 TiO2 nanostructures with a flower-like morphology have the advantage of a large number of active sites, unique morphology, and the combination of micro- and nanoscales.17 Therefore, it might be assumed that unique TiO2 flower-like nanostructures possessing a high surface area could be a suitable photoanode material to achieve high performance DSSCs. Feng et al. reported the synthesis of pure spheres, flowers and mixed (flower/sphere) TiO2 nanostructure based thin films for DSSCs with both ionic liquids and gelled ionic liquid electrolytes and demonstrated a considerably enhanced overall conversion efficiency.18 In another report, Jiang et al. studied a photoanode based on a self-assembled composite nanostructure of TiO2 nanoflower clusters (NFC) and P25 (TiO2 particles) for the fabrication of DSSCs. However, the reported conversion efficiency was quite low.19 In general, the growth of ordered TiO2 nanostructures, such as those with a flower-like morphology, requires a seed layer of a Ti precursor to achieve the desired morphology. In the present work, unique and highly dense TiO2 NF thin films have been grown on Ti coated FTO substrates by a modified HF supported hydrothermal method. Herein, HF serves as an etching agent for the Ti coated FTO substrate, which also provides a Ti source for the formation of TiO2 NFs. Importantly, a Ti seed layer has not been used for the growth and the Ti coated FTO substrate is directly used for the growth of TiO2 NFs. The as-grown TiO2 NFs are applied as an effective photoanode for the fabrication of DSSCs. An improved solar-to-electric conversion efficiency of ~3.64% is achieved under ~100 mW cm−2 (1.5 AM) by the highly dense TiO2 NF thin film.
Experimental
Synthesis of the TiO2 NFs on Ti coated FTO substrates
Prior to the deposition of the Ti layer, the fluorinated tin oxide (FTO, Hartford Glass Co., 8 Ω sq−1, 80% transmittance in the visible spectrum) glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in acetone, ethanol and deionized (DI) water and finally dried in air. A thin Ti film with a thickness of ~500–600 nm was deposited by RF magnetic sputtering on cleaned FTO glass substrates at room temperature using the Ti target as a source. Initially, the chamber was evacuated to the base pressure of ~5 × 10−6 Torr by a turbo molecular pump and then the deposition was performed at a working pressure of ~5 mTorr with an R.F. power of 150 W under argon gas at a flow of 50 sccm. After 40 min, a uniform and smooth thin Ti layer was deposited on the FTO substrates. For the growth of the TiO2 NFs, the prepared Ti coated FTO substrates were arranged horizontally, keeping the Ti coated side upward, in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave containing a 20 mM HF (99.9%, Sigma Aldich) solution. Finally, the autoclave was maintained at a temperature of 110 °C for 8 h. After the deposition, the TiO2 NFs thin film substrates were washed several times with DI water and dried in an oven at 80 °C. The as-grown TiO2 NF thin film substrates were calcined at 450 °C for 1 h and utilized as a photoanode.
Fabrication of the TiO2 NFs thin film photoanode based DSSCs
The fabrication of the DSSC was performed accordingly, as reported elsewhere.20 In brief, the prepared TiO2 NF thin film substrates were immersed in an ethanolic solution of ruthenium(II) 535 bis-TBA dye (0.3 mM, N-719, Solaronix) for 20 h at room temperature under dark conditions. After dye absorption, the dye adsorbed TiO2 NF thin film substrates were rinsed with absolute ethanol and dried under a nitrogen stream at 40 °C. On the other hand, the Pt deposited FTO substrate counter electrode was placed over the dye absorbed TiO2 NF thin film photoanode and the edges of the cell were sealed with a 60 μm thick Surlyn sheet (SX 1170-60, Solaronix) by hot-pressing the two electrodes at 80 °C. Later, the redox electrolyte (0.5 M LiI, 0.05 mM I2, and 0.2 M tert-butyl pyridine in acetonitrile) was introduced through the holes in the counter electrode on the dye absorbed TiO2 NF thin film photoanode and lastly, the holes were sealed with small microscopic glass and a Surlyn sheet.
Characterization
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4700) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010-JEOL, Japan) were used to investigate the morphology of the TiO2 NFs thin films. The crystalline nature and phases of the TiO2 NF thin film were studied by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rigaku, Cu Kα, λ = 1.54178 Å) in the Bragg angle range between 20°–80°. The optical properties of the TiO2 NFs thin film were demonstrated by ultra violet-diffused reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS, 2550 Shimadzu, Japan) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (JASCO, FP-6500). The Raman spectrum (Raman microscope, Renishaw) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an AXIS-NOVA CJ109, Kratos Inc., in the range of 0–800 eV to investigate the surface structure and bonding of the TiO2 NFs thin film. The electrochemical impedance (EIS) measurements of TiO2 NF thin film photoanode based DSSC were carried out in a frequency range from 100 kHz–1 Hz by applying a 10 mV alternating current (ac) signal using a potentiostat with a lock-in amplifier by VersaSTAT4. Current density (J)–voltage (V) measurements were performed to elucidate the performance of the TiO2 NF thin film photoanode based DSSC using a computerized digital multimeter (model 2000, Keithley) with a variable load under one sun (1.5 AM at 100 mW cm−2). A 1000 W metal halide lamp supplied the light and the intensity was adjusted to simulate 1.5 AM at 100 mW cm−2 using a Si photodetector fitted with a Ka-5 filter as a reference, which was calibrated at NREL, USA. Before the J–V measurements, a mask of black tape was pasted on top of the cell, exempting the active area. The operating temperature was maintained in the range of 20–30 °C by a small cooling fan. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was carried out by a specially designed IPCE system for DSSCs by PV measurements, Inc., USA. Before performing the IPCE measurements, the system was calibrated with a silicon photodiode, which was calibrated using the NIST-calibrated photodiode G425 as standard. The IPCE results of the DSSCs were collected as a function of the wavelength from 400–800 nm using a 75 W Xe lamp as a light source to generate a monochromatic beam at a low chopping frequency. The charge collection efficiency and photoelectron density were revealed by analysis using intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) using IVIUM technologies (CompactStat.e20250, USA).
Results and discussion
The morphology of the as-grown TiO2 thin film has been investigated by FESEM measurements, as presented in Fig. 1. The low magnification images (Fig. 1(a, b)) reveal highly dense and uniform TiO2 NFs grown on the surface of the FTO substrate by the hydrothermal process. Noticeably, the Ti layer on the FTO substrate is completely changed to a flower-like morphology in the presence of the HF solution. Fig. 1(c, d) are the high magnification images of the TiO2 NFs, which display a consistent flower-like morphology. Each TiO2 NF is comprised of well-defined and uniform clover-like petals with the average diameter of ~80–100 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(d), whereas the average diameter of the as-grown TiO2 NFs is ~400–500 nm.

The morphological properties of the as-grown TiO2 NFs are further characterized by TEM, HRTEM and the selected area electron patterns (SAED), as shown in Fig. 2. According to the FESEM results, well defined and uniform TiO2 NFs with an average diameter of ~400–500 nm are observed, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Moreover, each flower is made up of a bundle of clover-leaf petals with an average diameter of ~80–100 nm. Fig. 2(b) depicts the corresponding SAED patterns, exhibiting clear bright spots or phases towards the [100] growth direction. Likewise, the HRTEM images (Fig. 2(c, d)) show well-resolved lattice fringes of the as-grown TiO2 NFs with an average interplanar distance between the two fringes of ~0.35 nm. The obtained interplanar distance is close to the typical interplanar distance of anatase TiO2 nanomaterials.21

Fig. 3 depicts the topographic and 3D atomic force microscopic (AFM) images of the as-grown TiF thin film. Fig. 3(a) exhibits the aggregated petals or flower-like morphology of the as-grown TiO2 thin film on the FTO substrate, which is consistent with the FESEM and TEM results. The average size of the petals is estimated as ~100 nm and each flower presents an average size of ~500 nm. The 3D AFM image (Fig. 3(b)) displays a uniform surface and low roughness of ~33.7 nm (Rrms). Thus, the AFM results again deduce the growth of a uniform and smooth thin film of TiO2 flowers on the FTO substrate by the hydrothermal process.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the TiO2 NFs thin film is presented in Fig. 4(a) in order to define the crystal structure of the as-grown TiO2 NF thin film. The appearance of diffraction peaks at ~25.2°, ~37.5°, ~47.7°, ~53.8°, ~62.4°, and ~68.1° are associated with typical anatase TiO2 nanomaterials (JCPDS no. 89-4203). The other diffraction peaks at ~26.4°, ~33.8°, ~51.3°, ~61.3° and ~65.3° represent the FTO substrate (JCPDS no. 88-0287),10 suggesting the deposition of TiO2 NFs on the FTO substrate. No pure Ti diffraction peak is seen, which confirms the complete conversion of Ti into TiO2 NFs. The dominant anatase phase supports that the as-grown TiO2 NF thin film exhibits only anatase TiO2. In order to investigate the optical properties, the UV-DRS and room temperature PL spectra of the as-grown TiO2 NF thin film are examined. Fig. 4(b) shows the UV-DRS of the as-grown TiO2 NF thin film. A broad absorption edge in the ultraviolet region near ~393 nm is seen, which corresponds to a typical anatase TiO2 absorption edge in the UV region.22 This peak usually occurs due to the charge-transfer from the valence band to the conduction band of TiO2.22 The corresponding band gap energy of ~3.16 eV is much closer to anatase TiO2 in bulk. Fig. 4(c) represents the room temperature PL spectrum of the TiO2 NFs. Two emission peaks at ~470 nm and ~580 nm are obtained in the PL spectrum of the as-grown TiO2 NFs. The emission peak at ~470 nm is assigned to the charge-transfer transition from Ti3+ to the oxygen anion in a TiO68− complex, which is related to the oxygen vacancies at the surface.23 The existence of an emission peak at ~580 nm is related to green emission and might arise due to some surface defects. However, the exact origin is unknown at this time. Thus, most of the excited electrons turn back to the shallow donor level created by the oxygen vacancies in the valence band and simultaneously, at room temperature, most of the electrons in the shallow level are thermally ionized due to the transition in the conduction band, which might recombine through non-radiative transitions, resulting in the dominance of the emission peak at ~470 nm.24

The Raman scattering spectrum is studied to investigate the structural composition of the as-grown TiO2 NF thin film. Fig. 5(a) shows the Raman spectrum of the as-grown TiO2 NF thin film in the range of 100–800 cm−1. The as-grown TiO2 NF thin film exhibits a strong Raman band at ~147.8 cm−1 with three other Raman bands at ~396.4, ~513.6 and ~634.2 cm−1, corresponding to Eg, B1g, A1g and Eg3 respectively.25 The origin of the strongest Raman band at ~147.8 cm−1 is due to the anatase phase and consistent with the reported literature.26 The Raman spectrum does not exhibit any Raman mode near ~445 cm−1, indicating the absence of a rutile phase in the as-grown TiO2 NFs. Thus, the as-grown TiO2 NFs exhibit a pure anatase phase with good crystal quality. Fig. 5(b, d) show the corresponding Raman mapping in the range of ~125–198, ~479–535 and ~585–660 cm−1. Fig. 5(b) reveals a highly bright and visible surface in the mapping, which is obviously due to the Raman band at ~146.4 cm−1. However, the Raman mapping in the ranges of ~479–535 and ~585–660 cm−1 depict less visible regions with few bright parts, suggesting the existence of few defects or oxygen deficiencies.

The X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) has been analyzed to explain the existence of chemical species on the surface of the as-grown TiO2 NFs, as shown in Fig. 6(a). The survey XPS exhibits four major binding energy peaks of Ti 2p, Sn 3d, O 1s and F 1s. The binding energies of Sn 3d and F 1s are associated with the FTO substrate. Fig. 6(b) shows the fitted Ti 2p XPS spectrum of the as-grown TiO2 NFs, exhibiting doublet binding energy peaks at ~456.8 eV and ~462.4 eV, which are assigned to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 respectively.27 The observation of these binding energies establishes the +4 oxidation state of Ti, i.e., the Ti+4 oxidation state. The appearance of resolved binding energies at ~461.5 and ~463.7 eV confirm the existence of Ti+3 states, as also seen in the PL results. Importantly, the difference between the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 binding energies is estimated as ~5.6 eV, which is in excellent agreement with the reported pure anatase TiO2 values.28Fig. 6(c) depicts the fitted O 1s XPS spectra and displays two fitted peaks at ~529.9 and ~531.1 eV with the main center peak at ~528.8 eV. The main central binding energy at ~528.8 eV corresponds to the oxygen atom bonded with the Ti atom as Ti–O–Ti (lattice O). Additionally, the nature of the oxygen is confirmed as an oxide form. The other fitted binding energies at ~529.9 and ~531.1 eV are mainly ascribed to moisture and a few contaminants which are present on the surface of the TiO2 NFs.28 Thus, the as-grown TiO2 NFs might present nearly stoichiometric ratios of Ti:O (2:1).

The formation of the TiO2 NFs is explained by the proposed mechanism, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Firstly, a uniform and smooth thin Ti layer is deposited on the FTO substrate by RF magnetic sputtering with an RF power of 150 W. Secondly, the prepared Ti coated FTO substrate is directly used as Ti precursor for TiO2 growth. Prior to the hydrothermal treatment, the Ti coated FTO substrate is horizontally dipped into a 20 mM HF solution. At the beginning of the hydrothermal process, HF etches the Ti layer on the FTO substrate and creates a roughened surface. Following the chemical etching, the Ti layer reacts with HF to form H2TiF6 under the hydrothermal condition:Ti + 6HF → H2TiF6 + 2H2As the reaction time increases, the continuously produced H2TiF6 further reacts with H2O and forms Ti(OH)4:H2TiF6 + 4H2O → Ti(OH)4 + 6HFThe formed Ti(OH)4 initially produces TiO2 particles under the hydrothermal conditions as:Ti(OH)4 → TiO2 + 2H2OThe formed TiO2 nanoparticles are distributed uniformly on the surface of the FTO substrate at first nucleation. Under prolonged heating, the formed TiO2 starts aggregating and increases in size to form leaf petals.29 After 8 h of the hydrothermal reaction, the leaf petals are rearranged into flower-like TiO2 nanostructures on the FTO substrate, as shown in Fig. 7. In this synthesis, the Ti layer and HF provide a Ti source for the formation of flower-like TiO2 nanostructures on the FTO substrate and an etch agent respectively.

Charge transportation and charge collection in DSSCs are very complex systems constituting various interfaces in which a high accumulation of electrons usually occur due to the transportation of photo-generated electrons under light-illumination. In this regard, electrochemical impedance (EIS) measurements of the TiO2 NFs thin film photoanode-based DSSC were carried out in a frequency range from 100 kHz–1 Hz by applying 10 mV and the alternating current (ac) signal is examined, as shown in Fig. 8(a). In general, an EIS plot is composed of two semicircles which represent the resistance of the redox electrolyte solution (RS) at high frequency, the charge transfer resistance (RCT) at the interface of the electrolyte and TiO2, the charge transfer resistance at the interface of TiO2 and TCO (RTIO2/TCO) and the charge transfer resistance at the interface of the counter electrode and TCO (RCE).30 In an EIS plot, the diameter of each semicircle defines the charge transfer resistance of the fabricated DSSCs. Herein, the fabricated DSSC with the TiO2 NF thin film photoanode presents a reasonable RTIO2/TCO of ~15.6 Ω and RCT of ~33.2 Ω. In particular, the RCT value is quite low compared to reported DSSCs fabricated with TiO2 nanostructure photoanodes.31 A low RCT value usually favors a fast charge transfer rate in the electrochemical system at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte layer interface.32 Therefore, the TiO2 NF thin film photoanode provides a good surface for high charge transfer, which might result in a high conversion efficiency. Fig. 8(b) shows the corresponding Nyquist curve in Bode imaginary plots of imaginary parts of the impedance versus frequency. The presence of a phase peak at higher frequencies is related to the recombination sites at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, suggesting a decrease in the photovoltage and photocurrent. In order to explain the charge transfer and the recombination processes, IMPS and IMVS measurements have been performed. The charge-transport time (τCT) and the electron recombination time (τR) of the fabricated device could be calculated from the IMPS and IMVS plots respectively. The minimum frequencies of the IMPS and IMVS plots are used to calculate the τCT and τR values respectively, as presented in Fig. 8(c, d). The TiO2 NF thin film photoanode-based DSSC shows a good τCT of ~20 ms and τR of ~289 ms, indicating that the flower-like morphology could facilitate the charge transfer and shorten the recombination rate. It is seen that the distribution of flowers on the FTO substrates is uniform and they are closely connected to each other, which might reduce the grain boundaries and improve the charge transfer and the collection rate. The processes called electron–hole recombination and electron diffusion are explained by observing the value of the electron diffusion length (DL) i.e. DL = (Dn · τR)1/2.33 The Dn value is estimated as ~3.06 × 103 μm2 s−1 from the IMPS plot of the TiO2 NF thin film photoanode-based DSSC. The DL value of the TiO2 NF thin film photoanode-based DSSC is ~29.7 μm, suggesting a higher probability of electrons entering from the TiO2 photoanode layers to the counter electrode. By taking the values of τCT and τR, the charge collection efficiency of the fabricated DSSC could be determined by the relation ηCC = 1 − (τCT/τR). The obtained ηCC value for the TiO2 NFs thin film photoanode-based DSSC is reasonably high due to the better life time of the charge recombination and the high electron-transport time, as shown in Fig. 8(c, d). These factors have promptly enhanced the photocurrent density and the conversion efficiency of TiO2 NF thin film photoanode-based DSSC.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the TiO2 NF thin film photoanode-based DSSC are obtained under a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1.5 AM), as shown in Fig. 9 and summarized in Table 1. Compared to DSSCs fabricated with a P-25 photoanode (5.9%), an overall conversion efficiency of ~3.64% with a high JSC value of ~9.6 mA cm−2, VOC of ~0.671 V, and FF of ~0.57 are achieved by the TiO2 NF thin film photoanode-based DSSC. The high photocurrent density and performance are explained by the high charge collection and the lower numbers of recombination sites towards the photoanode. As shown in Fig. 8(c, d), the TiO2 NF thin film photoanode-based DSSC exhibits enhanced τCT, τR and DL values, which have significantly upgraded the photocurrent and performances of the fabricated DSSC. In support, the charge collection efficiency is reasonably high to define high photocurrent density and photovoltage. On the other hand, the unique and the closely connected NFs might be helpful for increasing the dye loading through the high surface area of the TiO2 NFs, resulting in the high light harvesting efficiency and photocurrent density. Furthermore, Fig. 9(b) shows the IPCE of the TiO2 NF thin film photoanode-based DSSC to elucidate the origin of the photocurrent under the range of wavelengths. The TiO2 NF thin film photoanode-based DSSC acquires broad IPCE curves with a maximum IPCE of ~39.4% at the highest absorption edge of ~515 nm. This result is consistent with the J–V and IMPS/IMVS results. It is reported that high dye loading through the photoanode gives a high light harvesting efficiency, leading to photoelectron injection from the dye to the CB of TiO2 and producing the photocurrent. Thus, the TiO2 NF thin film photoanode-based DSSC accomplishes better photovoltaic properties, such as conversion efficiency, JSC, VOC, and FF, owing to its improved charge transfer/collection time, lower recombination time, good charge collection efficiency and low RCT.

Conclusions
Highly dense and well-defined TiO2 NFs are directly grown on Ti coated FTO substrates by the hydrothermal process. Herein, Ti coated FTO substrates with a thickness of ~500–600 nm are obtained by RF magnetic sputtering at room temperature with a pressure of ~5 mTorr. The unique TiO2 NF thin film substrates are successfully applied as a photoanode for the fabrication of DSSCs. The morphological and crystalline properties reveal that the TiO2 NFs are composed of highly crystalline and uniform clover-like petals with an average diameter of ~80–100 nm. The Raman results deduce that the synthesized TiO2 NFs possess a pure anatase phase with a good crystal quality. The TiO2 NF thin film photoanode-based DSSC accomplishes a reasonably good overall conversion of ~3.64% with a high short circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of ~9.6 mA cm−2. The TiO2 NF photoanode-based DSSC exhibits a reasonably high ηCC due to the better life time of the charge recombination and high electron-transport time.
