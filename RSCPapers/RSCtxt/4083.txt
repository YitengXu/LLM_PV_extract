    , Accepted 4th March 2019First published on 7th March 2019AbstractAll-inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) perovskite quantum dots have great potential in the field of white light emission owing to their excellent optical properties. However, to date the research on white light based on perovskite quantum dots has focused on downconversion luminescence, while the up-conversion luminescence properties of quantum dots have received less attention due to lacking the anti-Stokes luminescence properties of the material itself, resulting in limitations in upconversion white light emission to some extent. In this paper, upconversion lanthanide ion-doped fluoride nanoparticles and perovskite quantum dots are combined; the luminescence of the quantum dots is excited successfully by the upconversion luminescence of the nanoparticles and then composite samples with white emission are obtained with regulators of concentration.
Introduction
All-inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have attracted much attention in recent years owing to their outstanding optical and semiconductor properties, such as tunable bandgap and photoluminescence (PL) emissions by varying the halide composition, narrow emission bands, high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), and large absorption coefficients.1–6 These excellent properties make the QDs widely used in optical devices, such as solar cells, photodetectors, white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and so on.7–11 At the same time, there are quite a few methods for the preparation of white light emission using all-inorganic perovskite quantum dots.12–15 In 2016 Rogach et al. prepared water-resistant solid-state luminescent CsPbX3 QDs by coating with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane, which not only enhanced the stability of the QDs in the air but was also used to obtain a single-layer perovskite white LED device via combining green and red CsPbX3 nano power systems.16 In 2017 Wang et al. improved the water and thermal stabilities of CsPbBr3 QDs via coating with alkyl phosphate, and then constructed a white LED by combining the QDs with K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor and exciting it with blue light.17
However, the research on white light emission based on all-inorganic perovskite QDs mostly involves downconversion luminescence under ultraviolet (UV) or visible light excitation; there is a large gap in the upconversion white light emission LED area. The poor upconversion luminescence (UCL) properties of pure CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) QDs result in application limitations for upconversion luminescence LED devices.18–21 As compared with QDs, upconversion (UC) materials, especially rare-earth-co-doped UC materials, are excellent NIR luminescent materials, possessing several inherent advantages, including high refractive index, low phonon energy, and adequate thermal and environmental stability.22–25
Rare-earth-doped fluoride nanoparticles (NPs), especially lanthanide-doped fluoride NPs, are the most efficient upconversion luminescence materials with excellent upconversion effects and energy transmission processes between the lanthanide ions.26–29 β-NaYF4, with low phonon energy, is considered to be one of the most efficient host materials for upconversion luminescence, and can achieve blue and red luminescence emissions by doping Yb3+ as the sensitizer ion and Tm3+ as the activator ion.24,30 NaYF4 NPs, with different activator ions, have been reported to be used to produce white luminescence LED devices; nevertheless, there are still limitations.31
Here, β-NaYF4:Yb3+ Tm3+ NPs are selected as an effective sensitizer to excite the luminescence of CsPbBr3 QDs through a light reabsorption process, and we successfully achieve the emission of CsPbBr3 QDs by excited by 980 nm. The emission properties of NPs–QDs are consistent with those of pre-prepared CsPbBr3 QDs excited by 365 nm and exhibit narrow line widths of 15–20 nm. In addition, the white luminescence emission of the NPs–QDs complex is realized successfully by adjusting the concentration.
Experimental section
Chemicals
All chemicals were purchased from Aladdin and used without purification unless otherwise noted. Yttrium oxide (Y2O3, 99.99%, metals basis), ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3, 99.99%, metals basis), thulium oxide (Tm2O3, 99.9%, metals basis), gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3, 99.99%, metals basis), cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99.99%, metals basis), lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.999%, metals basis), oleic acid (OA, analytically pure, chemical reagent), oleylamine (OAm, 80–90%), 1-octadecene (ODE, >90.0%, GC), ethanol, cyclohexane, and toluene.
Synthesis of upconversion nanoparticles
Generally, 15 ml of ODE and 6 ml of OA were both placed into a three-necked flask and mixed until the solution became clear, and a certain molar percentage of rare earth chloride aqueous solution was added with stirring. After that, the temperature of the three-necked flask was slowly increased to 150 °C and then kept at this temperature for 1 h in a heating sleeve to remove water. Then, the temperature of the system was cooled to 50 °C naturally, and the flask was transferred to an oil bath pan. Subsequently, 8 ml of 0.5 mmol ml−1 NH4F and 2.5 ml of 1 mmol ml−1 NaOH were injected into the flask after rapid premixing. The above process was carried out under nitrogen protection. The reaction system was kept at 50 °C for 30 min to nucleate, and then the flask was transferred to a heating jacket. The temperature was slowly increased to 70 °C and then held for 30 min to remove methanol. Then, the temperature was quickly increased to 315 °C and kept at that temperature for 1 h to grow crystals, and then allowed to cool down to room temperature naturally. The whole reaction was carried out under a N2 atmosphere. The NPs were washed with ethanol and cyclohexane, and then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 mins five times. The precipitated NPs were dispersed in 3 ml of toluene.
Synthesis of all-inorganic-perovskite CsPbBr3 QDs
The same synthesis process was used for the QDs. The QDs were synthesized following a previous report by Protesescu et al. with some modification.3 5 ml of ODE was injected into a 50 ml three-necked flask, and then 0.188 mol of PbBr2 (0.087 g) was loaded into the flask. The flask was slowly heated to 120 °C with stirring via a magnetic stirring heating sleeve and then kept at this temperature for 1 h under a N2 atmosphere. Then 0.5 ml of OA and 0.5 ml of OAm were injected into the flask. After that, the temperature was increased to 150 °C, then 0.4 ml of precursor (Cs-oleate) solution was injected into the system rapidly. After 30 seconds, the reaction mixture was cooled with an ice-water bath. The CsPbBr3 QDs were collected by adding 20 ml of toluene and centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 10 mins. The precipitated QDs were dispersed in 10 ml of toluene.
Measurement and characterization
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra for colloidal solutions were collected in the 200–800 nm region. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were recorded using a Rigaku D/max 2200 X-ray diffractometer with a Hi-Star 2D area detector using Cu Kα radiation (1.54 Å) at 40 KV and 30 mA from 10° to 80°. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were carried out using a JEM-2100 at 200 kV.
Results and discussion
High-quality CsPbBr3 down-conversion luminescent material
High-quality CsPbBr3 QDs were successfully synthesized through a facile and novel method,21,32 as shown in Fig. 1(a), and showed good agreement with the standard cubic structure of CsPbBr3 (JCPDS: 54-0752). XRD peaks located at 2θ = 15.2°, 21.5°, 30.7°, 37.6°, 43.9°, and 63.4° can be assigned to the diffractions from the (100), (110), (200), (211), (220), and (400) crystal planes, respectively. A regular cubic shape with an average size of 11–12 nm can be clearly observed in the TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, as shown in Fig. 1(c), which corresponds to the XRD patterns. The inset shows the HRTEM images of the QDs, from which the interplanar distance of 0.3 nm can be assigned as the distance between the (200) crystal plane of the CsPbBr3 QDs (JCPDS: 54-0752). A peak of 525 nm with a narrow line width of 20 nm for luminescence emission (green line) can be observed in Fig. 1(b), a Stokes shift of 20 nm was exhibited between the emission peak and the absorption peak, and the PLQY of the as-synthesized QDs was evaluated as 84.4%, which is consistent with the previously reported values. Fig. 1(d) shows the color coordinates of the CsPbBr3 QDs at (0.79, 0.13), implying their high brightness.

Characterization of upconversion luminescent material β-NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanoparticles
Monodisperse β-NaYF4:30%Yb,0.2%Tm NPs with an average size of 25 nm, which was in good agreement with the JCPDS data (JCPDS: 16-0334), were revealed to be nanocrystals in the hexagonal phase, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (c). The XRD peaks located at 2θ = 17.8°, 30.5°, 31.5°, 44.1°, and 54.2° can be assigned to the diffractions from the (100), (110), (101), (201) and (211) crystal planes, respectively. The interplanar distance of 0.53 nm can be assigned to the (100) plane, as shown in Fig. 2(c) inset. The prepared β-NaYF4:30%Yb,0.2%Tm NPs had a bright blue luminescence emission, which included 365 nm (1D2 → 3H6), 475 nm (1G4 → 3H6) and 650 nm (1G4 → 3F4), as can be observed in Fig. 2(b). The inset shows the luminescence of the sample under 980 nm excitation. Fig. 2(d) shows the color coordinate of the NPs at (0.14, 0.11), implying their high blue brightness.

White light adjustment
To sensitize the photon upconversion in the CsPbBr3 QDs, we uniformly dispersed the NPs in a toluene solution containing different concentrations of QDs, so that the NPs can function as an internal excitation light source to excite the luminescence emission of the QDs. With increasing QDs concentration, a blue-to-white light appeared in the solution under 980 nm laser excitation, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Intriguingly, the emission peak of Tm3+ at 365 nm from the NPs disappeared absolutely, and the emission peak of Tm3+ at 475 nm vanished gradually in accordance with the QDs absorption when the emission of the QDs was enhanced with increasing QDs concentration. On this basis, we successfully obtained a NPs–QDs solution with white light emission (Fig. 3(b)). It can be observed that three emission peaks (475, 520, and 650 nm for the primary colors, respectively) were individually present in the UCL spectrum of the white light NPs–QDs solution. A TEM image of the NPs–QDs is shown in Fig. 3(c); the NPs and QDs existed individually in solution without being connected to each other. Fig. 3(d) shows the color coordinates of NPs–QDs solutions with different QDs concentrations, with the color coordinates of white light at (0.28, 0.29). Regrettably, the QDs will decompose after a period of time and the luminescence intensity will obviously weaken because of the existence of the NPs.

Mechanistic investigation of the energy absorption–reemission process
The emission of β-NaYF4:30%Yb,0.2%Tm NPs is a multiphoton process, so we carried out powder density-dependent UC measurements to confirm the involvement of multiphoton processes in the NPs. As shown in Fig. 4(a), we easily confirmed that the ultraviolet emission at 365 nm, blue emission at 475 nm and red emission at 650 nm were all three-photon processes due to the energy losses, corresponding to energy transitions from 1D2 to 3H6, 1G4 to 3H6, and 1G4 to 3F4, respectively. In view of the changes in the emission intensity in the UCL spectra of the NPs–QDs solutions with different concentrations, two possible mechanisms can be proposed: one is a direct energy transfer mechanism and the other is an energy absorption–reemission process. In the direct energy transfer mechanism, under 980 nm laser excitation, the energy of the 1D2 and 1G4 to 3H6 transfers from the NPs to QDs directly causes the transition of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, which is an energy to energy process. In the energy absorption–reemission process, the energy from the nanoparticles is converted into fluorescence emission at 360 and 475 nm, and then the fluorescence is absorbed by the QDs owing to the large absorption boundaries of QDs. The main difference between the two mechanisms is that the former is the direct transmission of energy and energy while the latter involves the transfer of energy to light emission and then to energy, so that the transmission efficiency of the former is higher than that of the latter. The direct energy transfer mechanism was denied indirectly by the TEM image of the NPs–QDs owing to the absence of a heterojunctions structure (Fig. 3(c)). In order to gain more insight into the energy transfer process, we investigated the concentration-dependent UCL decay of the NPs and NPs–QDs. Fig. 4(b) shows the UCL decay by monitoring the Tm3+ emission at 475 nm in the NPs and NPs–QDs with varying QDs concentrations under 980 nm excitation, and it can be observed that there was no reduction in the fluorescence lifetime, which means that there was no direct energy transfer between the NPs and QDs. Hence the energy absorption–reemission process was confirmed subsequently. In this process, the Yb3+ and Tm3+-doped NPs function as an NIR photon capturer to harvest and convert the NIR excitation light into UV and visible emission light through successive photon absorption and energy transfer upconversion. Then, the light emitted from the NPs is reabsorbed by the QDs to separate the excitons (electrons and holes), resulting in the transition of the electron from the valence band to the conduction band, then the electrons return to the valence band from the bottom of the conduction band and emit 520 nm luminescence emission. Subsequently, this combines with the luminescence of the NPs to realize white emission (Fig. 4(d)). A key feature of the energy absorption–reemission process is that the QDs possess a much larger absorption coefficient in UV than in blue light, and no absorption in red light (Fig. 4(c)).

Conclusions
In general, high-quality CsPbBr3 QDs down-conversion luminescent materials and β-NaYF4:30%Yb,0.2%Tm NPs were prepared. Furthermore, a white emission sample was obtained successfully by combining the NPs and QDs. In this system, the luminescence of the QDs can be observed under 980 nm laser excitation by using the NPs as the energy donor. These findings offer a general approach for white emission and fine-tuning NIR-triggered photon upconversion in QDs, which may open up a new approach for the exploration of QDs for versatile applications, such as ultrasensitive bioassays, white LEDs, and full-spectrum conversion in solar cells.
