    , Accepted 28th July 2010First published on 27th August 2010AbstractSix supramolecular electron donor–acceptor hybrids, based on a ruthenium(II) phthalocyanine [RuPc] coordinating different dendritic oligothiophene (DOT) ligands [Py-nT] (n = 3, 9, 21) in either one [RuPcCO(Py-nT)] or two [RuPc(Py-nT)2] axial positions, have been characterized by standard spectroscopic methods and their photophysical behavior has been established by using ultrafast and fast time-resolved techniques. Based on the spectrochemical and radiolytically generated [Py-nT] (i.e., one-electron reduction of [Py-nT]) and [RuPcCO(Py) or RuPc(Py)2] (i.e., one-electron oxidation of [RuPcCO(Py) or RuPc(Py)2]) features, the deactivation processes were assigned to a solvent independent energy transfer in RuPcCO(Py-3T) and RuPc(Py-3T)2 and a strongly solvent dependent charge transfer mechanism, which competes with the energy transfer and the intersystem crossing for RuPcCO(Py-9T), RuPc(Py-9T)2, RuPcCO(Py-21T) and RuPc(Py-21T)2.
Introduction
Multifunctionality, as a leading paradigm in designing electron donors and electron acceptors, has become an indispensable target in the fields of photochemistry and solar energy conversion. Such systems mimic the basics of one of the key steps in photosynthesis, namely, photoinduced charge separation.1 Donor–acceptor ensembles also play key roles in molecular photovoltaic2 and photogalvanic3 devices, whose ultimate function is the direct conversion of energy stored in the photogenerated radical ion pair states into electrical power. Hereby, a basic requirement is that the donor's excited state must be sufficiently reducing to mediate the transfer of electrons to the acceptor units. A great deal of work in this field is based on nature-inspired porphyrin-quinone arrays.4 Nevertheless, the introduction of other electroactive units and/or chromophores has also been probed.5
Efficient light capturing/harvesting over a broad spectral range emerges as an important mandate for the design of solar cells.6 A simple approach comprises the use of panchromatic mixtures of donor and acceptors as active layers.

Phthalocyanines (Pc)7 have emerged as a promising molecular component for artificial photosynthetic apparatuses, since they (i) exhibit large absorption cross-sections in the visible region, (ii) contain large, conjugated π-systems suitable for efficient electron-transfer processes, and (iii) possess strongly reducing or oxidizing characteristics determined by the nature of the peripheral functions.8
Oligothiophenes also possess interesting optical and electronic properties like: tunable absorbance, semiconductance, and light emission.9–11 The strong absorption of the dendritic oligothiophenes covers a wide range of the visible spectral region of the sunlight, and is supplementary to the absorption of the Pc. Both moieties are already and will also be in future promising candidates as building blocks for molecular electronics and organic electronic devices such as solar cells.12
Many examples of Zn(II)Pc-based multifunctional systems in which Pcs are supramolecularly connected with other electro- or/and photoactive systems such as fullerene have been reported.13 More recently, the great potential of Ru(II)Pcs as platforms for the preparation of multifunctional materials has been discovered.14 In contrast to Zn(II)Pc derivatives, very robust RuPc assemblies can be created by strong coordination of one or two pyridine axial ligands to the central Ru atom. In addition, these strongly coordinated axial ligands dramatically decrease the natural tendency of Pcs to form aggregates which usually lead to deactivation of the excited states formed upon illumination. Very recently, Ru(II)Pc-based dyads have also been incorporated as sensitizers in different types of solar cells.15
In a previous report, ruthenium(II) phthalocyanine [RuPc] linked to one or two pyridine-functionalized dendritic oligothiophenes via strong metal coordination (Chart 1) were implemented into bulk heterojunction solar cells yielding efficiencies of up to 1.6%.16 The current work, on the other hand, focuses on the direct identification and characterization of transient species, such as short-lived reactive intermediates and stable products. Importantly, the evaluation of optical, kinetic, and structural data will provide important incentives for optimizing the electron donor acceptor interactions in the photoactive layer and, eventually, solar cell efficiencies. Emphasis is placed on gaining comprehensive knowledge of the kinetics associated with excited state reactions and formation/stabilization of the resulting product species.

Results and discussion
In the electronic absorption spectra of RuPcCO(Py-nT) and RuPc(Py-nT)2 the features of the reference systems, namely Py-nT, RuPcCO(Py) and RuPc(Py)2, are discernable. In particular, the ground state features of RuPcs (RuPc(Py)2 and RuPcCO(Py)) are observable in the 300–325 nm (B-band) and in the 630 and 650 nm (Q-band) range, which is in perfect agreement with known RuPc based donor acceptor systems – not shown.17 Still, strong blue shifts of the RuPc maxima – when compared to other tetra-tert-butyl-substituted metallophthalocyanines18 – imply substantially enhanced metal-Pc interactions. Notable is a significant broadening of the Q-band features, when two Py-nT ligands are attached to RuPc.
The broad ground state features of the DOTs (Py-nT) between 350 and 550 nm – with absorption maxima around 349 nm for Py-3T, around 375 nm for Py-9T and around 385 nm for Py-21T – fall in between the B- and Q-band transitions of the RuPc. With increasing dendrimer generation, the absorption maxima red shift, broaden, and intensify. The absorption stems from π–π*–transitions within the Py-nT ligands and increases the light harvesting ability of the complex in the visible region.
In the donor–acceptor structures a red shift of the oligothiophene absorption as well as a broadening is seen. Such pertubations in the electronic absorption is indicative for molecular interaction between RuPc and the (Py-nT) moieties in RuPcCO(Py-nT) and RuPc(Py-nT)2. Also new absorption maxima are discernable at 474 nm, 489 nm and 492 nm due to the oligothiophene moiety, in toluene solutions.
In the next step of our photophysical investigations we turned to fluorescence measurements. In particular, the thiophene fluorescence in the Py-3T, Py-9T and Py-21T references was used as sensitive probes to test the RuPc containing RuPcCO(Py-nT) and RuPc(Py-nT)2 (n = 3, 9 and 21) donor–acceptor hybrids – see Fig. 1. All systems revealed significant quenching of the oligothiophene-based fluorescence11 with factors between 12 and 160, and stronger quenching for RuPc(Py-nT)2. In fact, when comparing solvents of different polarity, namely, from toluene to dichloromethane, the quenching undergoes a noticeable amplification by, for example, a factor of 1.3 in the case of RuPcCO(Py-9T). This might serve as first evidence for an intramolecular deactivation through charge transfer, which is expected to commence with the singlet excited state of the DOT components – determined from the energetic difference of long wavelength absorption and short wavelength emission with 3.04 eV, 2.71 eV and 2.64 eV for Py-3T, Py-9T and Py-21T – affording the corresponding radical ion pair state.
 Fig. 1  Room temperature absorption and steady state fluorescence spectra of Py-3T (i.e., black line), Py-9T (i.e., grey line), and Py-21T (i.e., brown line) with matching absorption at the 350 nm excitation wavelength recorded in deaerated toluene (OD350 nm = 0.145). 
In terms of time-resolved fluorescence measurements notable decays were only registered for the Py-3T, Py-9T and Py-21T references with lifetimes of 180, 370 and 500 ps, respectively. These lifetimes are in reasonable agreement with those determined in transient absorption measurements – vide infra. Considering the steady-state quenching we must assume that the fluorescence lifetimes in the donor–acceptor hybrids fall within the time resolution of our instrument, that is, approximately 100 ps.
To get further insight into the deactivation mechanism we tested all systems, that is, donor–acceptor hybrids, by means of transient absorption measurements following 387 nm or 650 nm photoexcitation. Based on the absorption characteristics we employed 387 nm to almost exclusively photoexcite the DOTs, while 650 nm photoexcitation is expected to reach only the RuPc component.
For Py-3T the following differential absorption changes (i.e., visible and near-infrared) grow in essentially right after the conclusion of the excitation at 387 nm. In the visible a minimum and a maximum appear at 440 nm and 565 nm, respectively, while a set of maxima are seen in the near-infrared at 835, 880 and 1010 nm. Spectroscopic and kinetic details are shown in Fig. 2. We assign this initial step to the ultrafast formation of the Py-3T singlet excited state as it evolves through a rapid internal conversion from a higher lying state (i.e., less than 1 ps). Importantly, all of these features decay rather rapidly to form a new transient that gives rise to only a single peak at 455 nm. The nature of this excited, namely, a triplet, was confirmed through quenching experiments with molecular oxygen. Observation of an isosbestic point at 486 nm further testifies to the clean singlet-to-triplet transformation. In line with this spectroscopic picture is the kinetic observation gathered in Fig. 2, which attests that the decay kinetics (i.e., singlet excited state) are a qualitative match of the formation kinetics (i.e., triplet excited state) with a rather short lifetime of only 67 ± 2 ps.

Lower part: time-absorption profiles of the spectra shown in the upper part at 440 and 575 nm monitoring the intersystem crossing. 
The singlet excited state of Py-9T reveals features that are significantly red-shifted when compared to Py-3T. In particular, for Py-9T maxima develop at 495, 870 and 1030 nm – see Figure S1. This is in line with the trend established in the ground state absorption. Minima, on the other hand, are seen below 400 nm and at 550 nm. It is interesting to note that the singlet lifetime is with 378 ± 3 ps markedly longer than in the aforementioned Py-3T. For the correspondingly formed triplet a 665 nm maximum – plus a shoulder around 505 nm – evolves.
These overall trends, namely, red-shifted transients and longer singlet lifetimes are further continued in Py-21T. Fig. 3 illustrates that minima at 415 and 585 nm and maxima at 515 and 1035 nm are formed immediately as a consequence of populating the singlet excited state. It is in the next step that the singlet excited state decays with a lifetime of 462 ± 10 ps to yield the triplet manifold. Spectral features of the latter are a transient with a rather broad band that maximizes around 750 nm. Overall, a remarkably good agreement is seen with recent work on DOTs lacking the pyridine groups.10,19 Common to all the donor–acceptor hybrids is, that immediately after the excitation, we note the singlet excited state features. To be precise, for RuPcCO(Py-3T) the following differential absorption changes were seen: maxima at 440, 835, 880 and 1010 nm (Fig. 4). These decay within 5.5 ± 0.7 ps to form a new transient that bears large resemblance with that of the RuPc triplet excited state. This assumption is based on detecting the triplet markers at 525 and 730 nm. A closer inspection brings as well the singlet excited state features to light (i.e., 450, 700, 740, 920 and 1025 nm). The short-lived nature of the singlet excited state (vide infra) renders it, however, impossible to see it emerging as a stable species. In fact, the energy transfer and intersystem crossing kinetics turned out to be virtually identical.

Lower part: time-absorption profiles of the spectra shown in the upper part at 425 and 1020 nm monitoring the intersystem crossing. 
 Fig. 4  Differential absorption spectra (visible and near-infrared) obtained upon femtosecond flash photolysis (387 nm – 150 nJ) of RuPcCO(Py-3T) in toluene with several time delays between 0 and 60 ps at room temperature – arrows are indicating the progression of the reaction as they are reflect in the legend. Lower part shows the time-absorption profiles of the spectra shown in the upper part at 512, 605 and 850 nm monitoring the energy transfer. 
Similarly, for RuPc(Py-3T)2 we noted the rapid formation (3.8 ± 1.2 ps) of the RuPc triplet excited state, which is slightly shifted (i.e., a minimum at 470 nm followed by a series of maxima at 524, 725 and 811 nm) due to the coordination of two ligands – not shown. In none of the cases, evidence was gathered that would substantiate a charge transfer reaction.20
Slightly different are the changes associated with the decay of the DOTs singlet excited states in RuPcCO(Py-9T). As Fig. 5 displays, we see the short-lived transient (16 ± 1 ps) due to the corresponding oligothiophene singlet with a minimum below 400 and maxima at 495, 870 and 1030 nm. As described for RuPcCO(Py-3T), at the conclusion of the singlet decay we notice the singlet and triplet excited features of RuPc. In the near-infrared part, however, a residual absorption is noted. Maxima at 510, 840 and 1040 nm are tentatively assigned to the radical cation of the oligothiophene component. The relative ratio between triplet (i.e., 730 nm) and radical cation (i.e., 510, 840 and 1040 nm) changes with solvent polarity. While in toluene (16 ± 1 ps) formation of the triplet prevails, in dichloromethane (8.9 ± 1.6 ps) the radical cation formation takes over. Spectroscopic corroboration for the radical ion pair state formation came from spectroelectrochemical and pulse radiolytical investigations. In pulse radiolytical and spectroelectrochemical oxidation of Py-9T the spectrum is dominated by strong maxima around 500 and 1050 nm (Figure S2). Due to the strong ground state absorption below 500 nm, this range exhibits, however, weaker absorptions for the radical cation (i.e., negative differential absorption changes). RuPc radical anion features, as monitored by spectroelectrochemical means, include maxima at 680 and 725 nm (Figure S3). The signature of both radical ions is in perfect agreement with the photolytical studies. The radical ion pair states are metastable in all solvents and decay, for example, in dichloromethane with a lifetime of 495 ± 10 ps. In turn, once the charge recombination processes come to an end, only the RuPc triplet excited states are discernable in the spectrum.

Lower part – time-absorption profiles of the spectra shown in the upper part at 425, 522, 611 and 886 nm monitoring the competition between energy and charge transfer. 
For RuPc(Py-9T)2 a similar conclusion is reached when turning to the near-infrared. In particular, in toluene and anisole the RuPc triplet features – maxima at 524, 725 and 811 nm – are formed (18.0 ± 2.0 ps) – Figure S4. Fig. 6 illustrates that only in dichloromethane the radical ion pair state emerges. A closer analysis reveals subtle changes relative to RuPcCO(Py-9T): Maxima are noted at 535, 720, 800, and 1000 nm, while a minimum evolves at 630 nm. Notable is an apparent mismatch with the radical ion pair features – RuPc radical anion/Py-9T radical cation – realized in RuPcCO(Py-9T). Nevertheless, the coordination of two Py-9T to RuPc is seen to impact the ground state absorption and, in turn, may affect the radical ion pair features, especially those of the RuPc radical anion, as well. Indeed, Figure S5 discloses that pulse radiolytical and/or spectroelectrochemical reduction of RuPc(Py)2 led to maxima at 565 and 835 nm. Spectral resemblance between spectroelectrochemistry and photophysics was only achieved upon oxidation of RuPc(Py)2 in RuPc(Py-9T)2 – see Figure S6. Here, maxima at 535 and 715 nm as well a minimum at 625 nm characterize the RuPc radical cation. Finally, the 800/1000 nm signatures of the Py-9T radical anion were confirmed upon reduction of Py-9T – Figure S7. From a multi-wavelength analysis we derived a lifetime of 115 ± 5 ps.
 Fig. 6  Upper part – differential absorption spectra (visible and near-infrared) obtained upon femtosecond flash photolysis (387 nm – 150 nJ) of RuPc(Py-9T)2 in dichloromethane with several time delays between 0 and 200 ps at room temperature – arrows are indicating the progression of the reaction as they are reflect in the legend. Lower part – time-absorption profiles of the spectra shown in the upper part at 450, 750, and 960 nm monitoring the competition between energy and charge transfer. 
For RuPcCO(Py-21T) the initially generated singlet excited state of the thiophene component, which is somewhat blue-shifted relative to what has been seen for ligand Py-21T, decays fast with a lifetime of 5.1 ± 1.3 ps. Product of this singlet excited state deactivation is – like for Py-9T – a combination of energy transfer and electron transfer (Fig. 7). The ligand Py-21T radical cation absorption is found predominantly in the near-infrared region with maxima at 830 and 990 nm, while in the visible the maximum at 535 nm is assigned to the same species. In fact, spectroelectrochemical oxidation with new features growing in at 530, 775 and 1000 nm confirm this putative assignment – see Figure S8. Also the RuPc radical anion maxima at 680 and 725 nm are discernable. Again, the relative ratio between the two pathways depends on the solvent polarity with electron transfer being favored in the more polar solvents. Fig. 7 documents that the lifetime of the radical ion pair state is 150 ± 4.0 ps to generate the RuPc triplet excited state.
 Fig. 7  Differential absorption spectra (visible and near-infrared) obtained upon femtosecond flash photolysis (387 nm – 150 nJ) of RuPcCO(Py-21T) in dichloromethane with several time delays between 0 and 150 ps at room temperature – arrows are indicating the progression of the reaction as they are reflect in the legend. Lower part shows the time-absorption profiles of the spectra shown in the upper part at 425 and 960 nm monitoring the competition between energy and charge transfer. 
Again, in stark contrast to RuPcCO(Py-21T), charge transfer in RuPc(Py-21T)2 – 4.3 ± 0.9 ps in dichloromethane – leads to the same changes that were seen when contrasting the reactivity of RuPcCO(Py-9T) and RuPc(Py-9T)2. Fig. 8 indicates the radical ion pair features transitions at 535, 725, 794 and 1090 nm, which correspond to the RuPc radical cation (i.e., 535 and 725 nm – Figure S6) and Py-21T radical anion (i.e., 800 and 1090 nm – Figure S9), respectively. The radical ion pairs state gives rise to a lifetime of 150 ± 5 ps. In toluene and anisole, on the other hand, energy transfer is the main deactivation path.
 Fig. 8  Upper part: differential absorption spectra (visible and near-infrared) obtained upon femtosecond flash photolysis (387 nm – 150 nJ) of RuPc(Py-21T)2 in dichloromethane with several time delays between 0 and 200 ps at room temperature – arrows are indicating the progression of the reaction as they are reflect in the legend. Lower part – time-absorption profiles of the spectra shown in the upper part at 450, 800 and 920 nm monitoring the competition between energy and charge transfer. 
Excitation at 670 nm, on the other hand, results exclusively in the formation of the RuPc singlet excited state, for which maxima at 450, 700, 740, 920 and 1025 nm evolve. Interesting is that the intersystem crossing, by which these singlet excited state features transform into the corresponding triplet manifold (i.e., maxima at 525 and 730 nm) is faster than what has been seen previously in the RuPc reference – see Fig. 9. Please compare 4.5 ± 0.5 ps for RuPcCO(Py-3T), RuPcCO(Py-9T), and RuPcCO(Py-21T), (i.e., toluene and anisole) to 60 ± 2 ps in the RuPcCO(Py) reference. Implicit are long range interactions between the Pc system and the sulfur atoms of RuPcCO(Py-3T), RuPcCO(Py-9T), and RuPcCO(Py-21T). Notable, no residual absorption is registered in the red. Even faster is the intersystem crossing RuPc(Py-3T)2, RuPc(Py-9T)2 and RuPc(Py-21T)2.
 Fig. 9  Upper part – differential absorption spectra (visible and near-infrared) obtained upon femtosecond flash photolysis (670 nm – 150 nJ) of RuPcCO(Py-3T) in toluene with several time delays between 0 and 65 ps at room temperature – arrows are indicating the progression of the reaction as they are reflect in the legend. Lower part – time-absorption profiles of the spectra shown in the upper part at 450, 520, 610 and 735 nm monitoring the intersystem crossing. 
These data were correlated with the thermodynamics in dichloromethane of the underlying energy and charge transfer processes. Adding the reduction and oxidation potential – see Table 1 – led to radical ion pair states (i.e., RuPc radical anion/DOT radical cation) for RuPcCO(Py-3T), RuPc(Py-3T)2, RuPcCO(Py-9T), RuPc(Py-9T)2, RuPcCO(Py-21T) and RuPc(Py-21T)2 that range from 2.68 to 1.96 eV in the Py-3T and Py-21T based donor–acceptor hybrids, respectively. Alternatively, for the optional radical ion pairs (i.e., RuPc radical cation/DOT radical anion) we estimate energies between 2.34 and 2.07 eV, when contrasting the Py-3T and Py-21T based donor–acceptor hybrids. In other words, the Py-3T singlet excited states in RuPcCO(Py-3T) (i.e., 3.04 eV) are expected to power an exothermic charge transfer either way. Similar is the situation for Py-9T (i.e., 2.71 eV) and for Py-21T (i.e., 2.64 eV). Competitive with these two charge transfer reactions is a transduction of singlet excited state energy to the RuPc singlet excited state (i.e., 1.93 eV). As the preceding sections point out the outcome of the photophysical studies is complex. Obviously, in RuPcCO(Py-3T) and RuPc(Py-3T)2 a deactivation via energy transfer is favored – in line with much larger driving forces (i.e., 1.11 eV) relative to the charge transfer events (i.e., 0.36 – 0.77 eV) – which excludes the charge transfer pathway. In RuPcCO(Py-9T), RuPc(Py-9T)2, RuPcCO(Py-21T), and RuPc(Py-21T)2, on the other hand, almost similar driving forces for the energy transfer (i.e., up to 0.78 eV) and charge transfer (i.e., up to 0.68 eV) processes emerge. Such scenarios activate the charge transfer pathway. One more aspect needs consideration, namely the reduction and oxidation of RuPc. Both are heavily impacted by the coordination of either one or two Py-9T/Py-21T. Owing to the harder reduction and easier oxidation of RuPc in RuPc(Py-9T)2/RuPc(Py-21T)2 relative to RuPcCO(Py-9T)/RuPcCO(Py-21T),16RuPc radical cation/Py-DOT radical anion formation dominates in the earlier, while the latter is governed by the formation of RuPc radical anion/Py-DOT radical cation. Interestingly, the longer radical ion pair state lifetime in RuPcCO(Py-9T) – relative to RuPcCO(Py-21T) – prompts to an inverted Marcus behavior, where the lifetime increases (i.e., 495 ± 10 versus 150 ± 4.0 ps) despite the larger driving force (i.e., 2.20 versus 1.96 eV). The latter is decisive rather than a better delocalization of the radical cation and/or larger donor–acceptor separation. Likewise delocalization over two DOTs in RuPc(Py-9T)2/RuPc(Py-21T)2 seems to be compensated by changes in the driving forces and/or the fact that Py-9T/Py-21T needs to undergo the unusual pathway of reduction. Regardless of the nature of the radical ion pair state, product of the charge recombination is the RuPc triplet excited state, for which energy of about 1.3 eV is estimated. Scheme 1 sketches the different deactivation pathways.

 Scheme 1  Energy diagram reflecting the deactivation pathways in RuPcCO(Py-3T), RuPcCO(Py-21T), and RuPc(Py-21T)2 – only major components are shown with their corresponding energy levels. Semiempirical AM1* calculations are also represented as they image the different HOMO (blue) and LUMO (yellow). 
Interesting is the look at the HOMO and LUMO in, for example, RuPc(Py-21T). Placing the HOMO on RuPc results in a LUMO + 2, which is strongly localized on Py-21T in an area close to where RuPc is coordinated. On the contrary, as a consequence of a RuPc LUMO, a much improved HOMO-3 delocalization is found on Py-21T. When inspecting RuPc(Py-21T)2 the RuPc HOMO/(Py-21T)2 LUMO picture remains unchanged – relative to RuPc(Py-21T) – with the exception that both Py-21T are involved with a small gap of 5.11 eV. However, a LUMO-3 RuPc evolves that is linked to (Py-21T)2 that reveals LUMO + 3 and HOMO character rendering it thermodynamically unstable and a rather large energy gap of 7.16 eV.
Conclusion
To summarize, excited state interactions between the broadly absorbing Py-3T, Py-9T, Py-21T – as excited state electron acceptors or excited state electron donors – and RuPc – as electron donors or electron acceptors – are dominated by a complex interplay of charge transfer and energy transfer events. Changing the solvent polarity and/or the DOT generation assists in gaining control over this competition. In particular, polar solvents (i.e., dichloromethane) and high DOT generations (i.e., Py-21T) favor charge transfer, while non-polar solvents (i.e., toluene) and low DOT generation (i.e., Py-3T) result in an exclusive energy transfer deactivation. Important is the gathered information for optimizing the efficiencies of solar cells made out of these materials. Taken into account that our previous investigations indicated that the best efficient solar cells were obtained using the first generation Ru(CO)Py-3T or RuPc(Py-3T)2 hybrids, it seems that energy transfer is a convenient event to occur within the electron donor–acceptor component of the solar cell before interfacial charge transfer to the PCBM acceptor.
