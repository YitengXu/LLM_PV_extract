    , Accepted 2nd December 2020First published on 9th December 2020AbstractLead-free perovskites exhibit low toxicity and have been investigated as new active materials for photoconversion applications. Among them, Cs3Bi2I9 perovskites have received extensive attention due to their eco-friendliness, excellent stability and high photosensitivity. Herein, the optical and electronic bandgap of Cs3Bi2I9 thin films are determined to be 2.19 eV and 2.55 eV, providing insights into strong excitonic photodetection materials. Furthermore, we introduce an ultrathin Al2O3 layer into the interface of Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs using the atomic layer deposition (ALD). The ON/OFF ratio can be significantly improved by 20-fold using an Al2O3 layer with an optimal thickness of 1.5 nm due to the interfacial-tunneling-effect. Moreover, the unsealed Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs exhibit excellent stability, and can retain 90% of their original performance after 30 days under ambient conditions (25 °C, RH = 60%). Furthermore, the potential application in diffuse reflection imaging has been explored based on Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs without encapsulation, confirming a high-resolution and high-contrast imaging demonstration.
Introduction
Recently, the newly booming all-inorganic metal halide perovskites, like lead-based halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I), have attracted extensive attention worldwide due to their outstanding optoelectric performance, such as tunable band gap, long carrier diffusion length, high carrier mobility, and large optical absorption coefficient.1–6 Benefiting from facile and low-cost fabrication, metal halide perovskites have been demonstrated to be ideal candidates for photoelectic conversion devices, such as solar cells, light emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, memristors, and photodetectors (PDs).7–12 Besides the commonly used perovskite thin films, single-crystal perovskites, such as nanowires or nanosheets, exhibit excellent conduction properties and unique structures, have also been widely studied for use in photodetectors.13,14 However, there is still a lack of perovskite-based PDs in the commercialization stage. Except for the immature fabrication technology, the main concerns are the toxicity, originating from lead, and poor stability. Therefore, the development of lead-free and stable inorganic perovskites is a promising research direction.
In previous studies, tin (Sn) or germanium (Ge) based perovskites have been considered to be promising alternatives to Pb-based perovskites, since both Sn and Ge atoms share a similar atomic radius and electron configuration to that of Pb. Unfortunately, they usually exhibit poor stability, which is mainly because divalent ions (Sn2+ and Ge2+) are readily oxidized to tetravalent ions (Sn4+ and Ge4+) in oxygen and water containing environments.15,16 Alternatively, bismuth (Bi)-based perovskites have been found to possess long-term stability and feature excellent photosensitivity; hence, they are regarded as promising lead-free perovskite materials for photo-detection applications.17–23 In addition, bismuth-based perovskite, due to its suitable band gap, shows potential application in the fabrication of blue light photodetectors. Since blue light can cause irreversible damage to human retinal cells, it is highly urgent to detect blue light for timely eye care. Though great improvement has been made, the halide migration induced dark current is still too high, which greatly limits their practical usage.23–25 In addition, the optical characterization of Cs3Bi2I9 perovskites has not been well-studied, which is critical for photocoversion applications. Furthermore, only a few research studies have focused on the imaging applications of Bi-based perovskite visbile light PDs. Therefore, it is still a challenge to obtain a lead-free perovskite PD with a high ON/OFF ratio and ambient stablity for imaging application.
As for imaging application, the ON/OFF ratio (Ilight/Idark) of PDs is one of the most important parameters that can be used to evaluate the performance of imaging systems. It suggests that reducing the dark current (Idark) of PDs can effectively improve the imaging quality. In our previous reports, it has been proved that introducing an ultrathin Al2O3 layer to heterojunction PDs is a promising way to reduce surface dark current.26,27 The carrier density at the interface can also be greatly tuned by altering the thickness of the Al2O3 layer. By optimizing the layer thickness, it is expected that suppressed dark current without deteriorating the photoresponsivity can be obtained. Additonally, a high ON/OFF ratio can be obtained by enhancing the tunneling current while suppressing the leakage current, which is cirtical for imaging application.
Herein, we delicately introduce an ultrathin Al2O3 modification layer into the interface of Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs, and further demonstrate diffuse reflection mode imaging applications. The ON/OFF ratio can be significantly improved 20-fold with the assistance of interfacial-tunneling effect. Moreover, the proposed ALD modification method is expected to be a universal interface engineering to reduce dark current and improves the photoelectric performance of other optoelectronic devices. The highly stable and lead-free all-inorganic Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PD is expected to have more broad applications.
Result and discussion
The whole procedure for the preparation of Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs on the FTO substrate with or without ALD-Al2O3 is schematically shown in Fig. 1(a). A stock solution of CsI and BiI3 in DMF/DMSO was spin coated on the ALD-Al2O3 modified FTO glass substrate (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm), which was then annealed using a hot plate. The details can be found in the Experimental section. The photograph of the as-prepared Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite films, exhibiting a mirror state with yellow color, indicates the smooth surface of the as-prepared Cs3Bi2I9 films. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the excitonic absorption peak of the Cs3Bi2I9 film at 494 nm (Tauc plot at 2.5 eV) is usually related to the strong quantum confinement effect of the zero-dimensional nature of [Bi2I9]3− bioctahedra,28 which is different from the continuous absorption edge of hybrid halide perovskites or cesium lead halide perovskites.1,16 The high excitonic binding energy is harmful to carrier mobility and charge collection and also causes serious recombination of photo-generated carriers.29 The presence of a strong excitonic peak in the absorption spectrum makes it difficult to determine the exact bandgap of Cs3Bi2I9. The indirect optical and electronic bandgaps of Cs3Bi2I9 are estimated to be around 2.19 and 2.55 eV, respectively, which is also consistent with previous reports.30 To study the structure and crystallization of the prepared Cs3Bi2I9 films, typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite films are shown in Fig. 1(c), which match well with the standard XRD pattern of Cs3Bi2I9 (JCPDS #23-0847). Fig. 1(d) shows the typical SEM images of Cs3Bi2I9; it can be seen that the polycrystalline films consist of many grain boundaries, which hinder efficient charge transportation. Fig. 1(e) displays the EDS mapping of the as-prepared Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite film, which shows uniform element distribution, including Cs, Bi, and I, further confirming the successful fabrication of Bi-based perovskite materials.

As shown in Fig. 2(a), the proposed Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs are based on an FTO/Al2O3/Cs3Bi2I9/Au sandwich structure. The incident light is from the bottom FTO side, and the active area of the device is 0.1 cm2. Here, an ultrathin Al2O3 modification layer is predeposited on FTO using an ALD technique, and a remarkble increase in the ON/OFF ratio can be realized. All of the tests were conducted under zero bias. Fig. 2(b) shows the typical I–t curve of Cs3Bi2I9 PDs with varied thickness of the Al2O3 layer (light conditions: 405 nm, 100 μW). For Cs3Bi2I9 PD without interface modification, the dark current can be as large as 291 nA. After the introduction of the ALD-Al2O3 layer, the dark current can be efficiently suppressed to be 0.12 nA. The shape of the I–t curve shows close dependence on the interface properties. The introduction of a 1.5 nm ALD-Al2O3 layer would contribute to forming a high-quality interface, alleviating carrier accumulation at the interface. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the light current also decreases after the introduction of the Al2O3 layer, which is likely due to the insulation of the alumina layer. Nonetheless, the dark current will drop more dramatically. With increasing thickness of the Al2O3 layer, the dark-current will firstly drop and then become relatively stable. The optimal thickness of the ALD-Al2O3 layer is determined to be 1.5 nm, which corresponds to the highest ON/OFF ratio, as displayed in Fig. 2(d). The ON/OFF ratio of the optimized Cs3Bi2I9 PD increases almost 20-fold when compared with that of PDs without interfacial modification. We also measured the valence-band maximum (VBM) of Cs3Bi2I9 thin films using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). As shown in Fig. 2(e), the position of the valence band maximum is calculated using both the Fermi level and the cut-off edge of the secondary electron. Fig. 2(f) shows the energy band diagram with the introduction of ALD-Al2O3. As shown in Fig. 2(f-1), in devices without the ALD-Al2O3 modification layer, the photogenerated electrons move towards the Au layer and holes move towards the FTO. It is also accompanied by a great deal of disorganized movement. Due to the small difference in energy bands, electrons and holes are prone to recombination at the interface. In this case, the dark current is largely due to serious recombination. In Fig. 2(f-2), for the device with ALD-Al2O3 modification, Al2O3 is pre-deposited on FTO as an intermediate layer. The difference in energy bands between Al2O3 and perovskite is so great that a very large barrier forms between the two layers, blocking the flow of electrons. In contrast, the holes flow across the Al2O3 layer with appropriate thickness through tunnelling. As the thickness of the Al2O3 film increases, the holes are difficult to pass through due to the insulating properties of the thicker Al2O3 layer, as displayed in Fig. 2(f-3). The accumulation of holes in the perovskite layer will increase the probability of electron/hole recombination.

Fig. 3(a) shows typical I–V curves of Cs3Bi2I9 PDs measured under 405 nm light illumination. It is obvious that the photoresponse properties of Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PD closely depend on light intensity. The photocurrent gradually increases with an increase in light intensity. Besides, the “zero current voltage” shifts with the change in light intensity.31Fig. 3(b) displays the spectral response characteristic of Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs. The response wavelength cuts off at 467 nm, which may be ascribed to the strong excitonic behaviour after this wavelength.29 The photoresponse curve shorter than 467 nm coincides with the absorption spectrum where the wavelength is less than 467 nm. Due to the high exciton binding energy, the photogenerated charge can be easily trapped on the Bi2I9 dimer rather than being collected as photocurrent. The reason accounting for the nonresponsiveness at a wavelength greater than 467 nm may be that the photocurrent is too weak to be detected.32Fig. 3(c) shows the typical I–t curves of the Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs measured under illumination of 405 nm with power ranging from 0.17 nW to 1.7 mW. It can be seen that the light current dramatically increases and decreases when light switches off either by strong (1.7 mW) or weak light (0.17 nW) illumination, and can stabilize at the “on” or “off” state. Then, we quantitatively study the relationship between photocurrent and light power (I–P), which can be roughly described by power law: I = APα, where I is the current under light illumination, A is a constant, P is the light power, and α is an exponent. After careful fitting of the I–P curves by power law, α is determined to be 0.983, which is very close to 1, indicating effective separation of photogenerated carriers.33 As shown in Fig. 3(e), the highest responsivity and ON/OFF ratio are determined to be 100 mA W−1 and 3.85 × 103 under light illumination of 0.17 nW and 1.7 mW, respectively. Based on the performance enhancement of Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs after interface modification, the potential application in imaging was explored.

The Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PD-based diffuse reflection mode imaging system is schematically shown in Fig. 4(a). The system consists of a 405 nm laser as the light source, an imaging sample, two electric sliding tables with a range of 50 mm controlled by a two-phase stepper motor controller with motor drive as a displacement platform, a Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PD as the imaging sensor, and a source meter (2601B, Keithley) as the data collector. Firstly, the incident laser beam (Li) focused by an optical lens (aperture of 25 mm and focus length of 100 mm) irradiates to position (x,y) of the imaging sample. Secondly, diffuse reflection will take place on the surface of the imaging sample, and the diffuse reflection light intensity (Ld) is mainly dependent on the absorption coefficient (R(x,y)) and roughness of the imaging sample. Therewith, the diffuse reflection light intensity can be detected by the Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs and recorded by the source meter. The above steps were repeated after changing the focus position (x,y) using the displacement platform; finally, the obtained light currents can be used to reconstruct the image using a point-to-point algorithm. Here, the reconstructed image can reflect the absorption coefficient (R(x,y)) of the imaging sample when the roughness is the same. As for imaging demonstration, a ‘cryprinus carpiod’ pattern was chosen as the imaging sample (Fig. 4(b)). The whole imaging process is controlled and recorded automatically using the LabVIEW program.

The imaging results by Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PD without and with interface modification are shown in Fig. 4(c and d), respectively. It can be seen that the image of modified Cs3Bi2I9 PD is clear enough to distinguish the details of the original patterns and fonts of the imaging sample, while that of the non-optimized one is not satisfactory. In Fig. 4(e), the optimized device has a higher single-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is consistent with the high imaging quality. SNR is defined as SNR = (Ilight − Idark)/Idark. Fig. 4(f–i) show the corresponding details of the imaging results, respectively. The main reason for the blurred image is that the large dark current can submerge the real signal and induce large noise. Dark current is largely caused by lattice defects introduced during material growth or local breakdown leakage effects caused by lattice damage during device preparation. ALD-Al2O3 serves as the intermediate layer which is introduced between the FTO and perovskite films, preventing the interdiffusion and interaction between halide ions like Br− and electrode. At the same time, a large barrier is created, which prevents the transportation of electrons and reduces surface carrier recombination, thus reducing the dark current. The results coincide well with the comparisons of dark current and ON/OFF ratios, as displayed in Fig. 2(c) and (d), respectively. In a word, it is concluded that ALD-Al2O3 modification can effectively reduce dark current and further improve the imaging performance of Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs.
Next, the stability is another important parameter for imaging application, because it directly relates to the accuracy of the obtained absorption coefficient (R(x,y)) in the reconstructed images. Here, the stability test can be divided into strong-light stability and long-term stability. Fig. 5(a) depicts typical I–t curves under strong light illumination (100 mW cm−2). It can be seen that the photocurrent shows little change within 200 s, suggesting the excellent strong-light stability of the Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs. On the other hand, the photocurrent can still retain 90% of its original value after exposure under ambient conditions (60% relative humidity (RH), 25 °C) for 30 days, as shown in Fig. 5(b). Also, careful comparison of the UV-vis absorption spectra reveals that the absorption edge exhibits no obvious change, indicating the excellent long-term stability. Additionally, the uniform yellow color also confirms the high stability of the as-synthesized Cs3Bi2I9 films, as shown in the insets of Fig. 5(c), which show the corresponding photographs. Of particular note is that the highly stable and lead-free Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs will pave a way for large-scale pixel array fabrication and imaging system integration.

Experimental
Materials and device fabrication
Bismuth iodide (BiI3, 99%), cesium iodide (CsI, 99.9%), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, 99.8%), and chlorobenzene (CB, anhydrous, 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite thin films were prepared using a one-step spin-coating method at room temperature in a glove-box. The precursor solution for Cs3Bi2I9 was prepared by dissolving a mixture of BiI3 (0.6 M) and CsI (0.9 M) in DMF/DMSO (v:v = 7:3) and stirring for 12 h at 70 °C. A series of ultrathin Al2O3 films (0.5, 1.5, 5 nm) were pre-deposited using the atomic layer deposition system (ALD, Beneq TFS200) on the FTO substrate (15 Ω sq−1) as the electron blocking layers. The ALD-Al2O3 precursors were aluminum trimethide (TMA) and H2O, and high purity nitrogen was used as the carrier gas. Thickness of the Al2O3 layer was adjusted by setting different cycle numbers (6 cycles for 0.5 nm, 16 cycles for 1.5 nm, and 53 cycles for 5 nm). Afterwards, the precursor solution was spin coated onto the ALD-Al2O3 modified FTO glass substrate at 5000 rpm for 30 s, the CB anti-solvent solution was dripped onto the film after 20 s; these substrates were then annealed using a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. Finally, a 100 nm Au film was deposited on the Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite films as the top electrode using the thermal evaporation method, which completed the fabrication of Cs3Bi2I9 PD.
Material characterization and photoresponse measurement
Using the XRD technique (Rigaku, Miniflex600), the Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite films were characterized to obtain the crystal structure. The optical absorption spectrum was characterized using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU, UV-2600). The SEM images were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, ZEISSULTRA 55). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was tested using a ESCALAB 250Xi UPS system (K-alpha+) with He Iα (21.22 eV) emission line. The Fermi level was calibrated by Ag. The sample was biased with −5 V to obtain the low energy secondary electron cut-off. I–V curves and photoresponse curves were measured using a Keithley source meter (2601A) and a 405 nm laser. The spectral response curve was measured using monochrome light from a QE-R external quantum efficiency instrument (Enlitech, Si detector S10-14010), and the current was recorded using a Keithley 2601A source meter.
Conclusions
To sum up, an ultrathin interfacial modification layer of ALD-Al2O3 is delicately introduced into Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs. Due to the strong exciton properties of the Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite, the optical bandgap and electronic bandgaps are determined clearly, providing alternatives for near-ultraviolet photodetection material selection. Significantly, the ON/OFF ratio can be significantly improved by 20-fold using an optimal thickness of 1.5 nm Al2O3 layer. The performance enhancement is proposed to the interfacial-tunneling effect. Moreover, the Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs also exhibit high stability, which can retain 90% of its original performance after exposure under ambient conditions for 30 days (25 °C, 60% RH). Furthermore, the greatly enhanced ON/OFF ratio further contributes to highly-sensitive optical imaging. The highly stable, lead-free Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite PDs are expected to have broader applications in optical communication, imaging, solar cells and so on.
