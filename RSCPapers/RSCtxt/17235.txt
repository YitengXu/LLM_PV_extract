    , Accepted 5th April 2013First published on 5th April 2013AbstractIn this work, we report a library of thirteen fluorinated ionic liquids consisting of iodide salts of 1-alkyl-3-polyfluoroalkyl-imidazolium cations. By changing the length of the alkyl and polyfluoroalkyl pendants, we discovered that particular combinations of these result in compounds showing a mesophase. The nature and the molecular arrangement of the mesophase are characterised by polarised optical microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction analysis, among others. We demonstrate that, after the addition of I2 to generate the I−/I3− redox couple, anisotropic ionic conductivity takes place along preferential pathways in the lamellar structure of the mesophase. Notably, the addition of I2 does not suppress the mesophase temperature range, contrary to previously reported systems. Furthermore, the tendency of these materials to supercool allows the molecular arrangement in the mesophase to be retained in a solid film at ambient temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate their applicability as a quasi-solid electrolyte by preparing dye-sensitised solar cells with power conversion efficiencies comparable to the previous reports.
Introduction
Room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs) have become important alternative electrolytes in various iono-optic and electrochemical devices due to their unique and useful properties,1 such as negligible vapour pressure, thermal stability, high ionic conductivity, and a large electrochemical window.2 It has been demonstrated that most of these properties can purposefully be tailored by the judicious selection of the organic cation and its anionic counterpart.3,4 Furthermore, the introduction of specific pendants on the cation may induce the formation of mesophases, thus generating ionic liquid-crystalline (ILC) materials.5,6 In particular, Bowlas et al. reported that 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide salts exhibit liquid-crystalline properties depending on the length of the alkyl substituent, with smectic A (SmA) phases arising for alkyl chains above eleven carbon atoms in length. A few years later, Yamanaka et al. demonstrated that imidazolium-based ILCs may promote anisotropic charge transport in I−/I3− redox couple electrolytes.7 They reported that in the SmA phase the imidazolium cations confine the redox couples along preferential pathways, allowing efficient charge transport to take place even at high viscosities.7 These8 and other authors9 also proved the potential applicability of such ILCs as quasi-solid state electrolytes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), with the main aim being to improve the long-term device stability compared to the solvent-based electrolytes. In particular, they used 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide to prepare DSSCs with light-to-electricity conversion efficiency comparable to low-viscosity IL-based electrolytes.9 However, upon addition of I2 to generate the I−/I3− redox couple, the SmA-to-isotropic (SmA–Iso) phase transition temperature was lowered from 353 to 319 K,8 which made the anisotropic charge transport ineffective under real device working conditions.10
While imidazolium-based ILs with fluorinated11 anions have been widely studied,3,12 there are relatively few reports on ILs carrying perfluoroalkyl groups on the cation.4,13–17 In the context of DSSCs, a novel imidazolium iodide IL with an ω-perfluoroalkyl poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) tail has recently been used as a solvent-free, ionic gel where microphase separation (fluorophobic effect)18 of the immiscible perfluoroalkyl and PEG segments attached to the imidazolium cation results in a nanostructured fluid that promotes high iodide diffusion at low effective fluidity.19 Similarly, we have reported that phase segregation between the long alkyl chains of an amphiphilic dye and a fluorous20 electrolyte solution results in animprovement of the charge-transfer dynamics at the TiO2-dye/electrolyte interface and of the transport in the electrolyte solution.21
Herein, we report a library of thirteen fluorinated ILs (FILs) consisting of iodide salts of 1-alkyl-3-polyfluoroalkyl-imidazolium cations, where the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl (p) and fluoroalkyl (r) chains, and in the alkyl spacer (q) are changed systematically (Scheme 1). Several combinations of p, q, and r result in compounds showing the emergence of mesophases, which are characterised by polarised optical microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction analysis, among others. Interestingly, we demonstrate that with p = 8, q = 3, and r = 6, after the addition of I2 in order to generate the I−/I3− redox couple in the FIL, anisotropic ionic conductivity was taking place in the mesophase which was stable over the temperature range of 300–390 K. This demonstrates the potential of these fluorinated ionic liquid crystals (FILCs) as quasi solid-state electrolytes in DSSCs.

Experimental section
Synthetic procedures4
Commercial HPLC-grade solvents were used without further purification. Starting materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros Organics, Apollo Scientific, and Fluorous Technologies. Reactions were carried out in oven-dried glassware under a nitrogen atmosphere. 1-Methyl-3-polyfluoroalkyl imidazolium iodides were synthesised by a quaternisation reaction of methylimidazole with the corresponding polyfluoroalkyl iodide. All other compounds were synthesised in a two-step process. Imidazole was reacted first with the alkyl-iodide to give alkyl-imidazole which was used in the second step with the corresponding polyfluoroalkyl iodide. Representative syntheses are described. 1H-NMR and 19F-NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature with a Bruker AV 500 spectrometer. CDCl3, (CD3)2SO or CD3OD was used as both solvent and internal standard in 1H-NMR spectroscopy (δCDCl3 = 7.26, δ(CD3)2SO = 2.50, δCD3OD = 3.31). For 19F-NMR spectroscopy CDCl3, (CD3)2SO or CD3OD was used as a solvent and CFCl3 as an internal standard. All chemical shift values are given in ppm. ATR-FTIR spectra were obtained with a Nicolet Nexus FTIR spectrometer. Values are given in wavenumbers and are rounded to 1 cm−1 upon automatic assignment. The mass spectra were recorded with a Finnigan Mod TSQ-70 instrument in FAB mode from an m-NBA matrix.

1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6-Tridecafluoro-9-iodononane (0.92 g, 1.9 mmol) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of 1-methylimidazole (0.15 g, 1.8 mmol) in toluene (5.00 cm3) over a period of 15 minutes. The reaction mixture was heated up to 120 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 16 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting white precipitate was filtered off. The crude product was purified by recrystallisation from a 1:1 v/v dichloromethane–diethyl ether solution to provide the pure imidazolium salt as a white solid.

Thermal and optical characterisation of liquid crystal phases
The phase transition temperatures, melting points, clearing points, and glass transition temperatures of the synthesized FILCs were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 DSC equipped with dinitrogen cryostatic cooling, 5–10 mg samples, 10 °C min−1 heating and cooling rates) and heating-stage polarising optical microscopy where appropriate (transition temperatures >0 °C) using an Olympus BX50 microscope equipped with a Linkam TH600 hot stage and a TP92 temperature controller. The transition temperatures measured on heating were within ±1 °C of the values obtained by differential scanning calorimetry, as measured at the peak of the transition. In many cases, the materials exhibited a marked tendency to supercool before crystallizing or forming glasses. The phase transition temperatures were given from differential scanning calorimetry measurements only for heating cycles.
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 shows the general formula of the fluorinated imidazolium iodide salts reported in this work. The imidazolium core (Im) bears at the nitrogen atoms an alkyl chain (RHp) containing p carbon atoms and a polyfluoroalkyl chain (RFr) containing r carbon atoms attached to the Im core through a spacer with q methylene groups (CHq). Therefore, the general formula for all the imidazolium iodide salts studied in this work can be summarised as [RHpImCHqRFr]+I−.
The LC properties of the synthesised FILs were examined by hot-stage polarised optical microscopy (POM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). All of the salts [RHpImCHqRFr]+I−, except for the p–q–r combinations of 1–2–4, 3–3–6, 4–2–4, 4–3–6, and 5–3–6, displayed thermotropic mesomorphism in the form of a single, enantiotropic SmA phase as confirmed by the characteristic optical texture (Fig. 1, right). Interestingly, on cooling from the isotropic phase, the liquid films showed birefringence patterns, which rapidly disappeared as a consequence of a highly efficient homeotropic alignment common in mesogens possessing fluorous chains.
 Fig. 1  Left: phase diagram of the salts [RHpImCH3RF6]+I− showing the mesophase temperature range as a function of the number of carbons (p) in the alkyl chain. Right: the mesophase texture of [CH8ImCH3RF6]+I− under crossed polarised light obtained on cooling at 297 K. 
The phase diagram plotted for the salts [RHpImCH3RF6]+I− shows a steep destabilisation of the melting and clearing points for intermediate lengths of the terminal hydrocarbon chain, which then recover equally steeply as the chain length increases (Table 1). Clearly there are significant issues associated with molecular packing most probably related to the incompatibility of the hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon segments, which will be investigated in due course. The stabilisation of the clearing point is greater than the stabilisation of the melting point as p increases from 6 to 12 so that a mesophase temperature range of 71 K (from 321 to 392 K) was achieved with [RH8ImC3RF6]+I−, which thus appears to be an extremely interesting candidate for solar cell applications, meeting the operational requirements of DSSCs.10

To investigate further the arrangement of molecules in the mesophase of [RH8ImC3RF6]+I−, we performed high-resolution, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (HR cryo-TEM)22 and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis as a function of temperature. The high-temperature mesophase order of [RH8ImC3RF6]+I− was imaged with a HR cryo-TEM after freezing the sample with liquid helium.22Fig. 2 (top) clearly shows a lamellar arrangement with stacking of dark and bright layers spaced by approximately 2 nm. The dark layers can tentatively be ascribed to regions of high electron density (polyfluoroalkyl chains) segregated from regions of low electron density (alkyl chains).
 Fig. 2  (A) HR cryo-TEM micrograph of [RH8ImC3RF6]+I− showing a lamellar pattern. The sample was kept at 353 K for 2 h, and then cooled down and cut at 173 K and measured at 83 K. (B) Close-up of (A) showing the lamellar period of 2.3 nm. (C) Electron density map in perpendicular directions showing a contrast between the polyfluoroalkyl (dark) and alkyl chains (bright). (D) Molecular model of the mesophase structure, where fluorine atoms are highlighted in yellow. 
In order to investigate the mesophase dimensions and hopefully confirm the data obtained by cryo-TEM, variable-temperature PXRD analysis was carried out on a thick film obtained by cooling the sample down from the isotropic phase. For temperatures higher than the clearing point, i.e. 392 K, no reflection peaks were observed. However, just below the clearing point, two main reflections at 3.8 and 11.4° 2θ appeared, which are attributed to the (001) and (003) lamellar reflections of the SmA phase with a d-spacing of 2.32 nm. This is perfectly in line with the spacing observed in the cryo-TEM experiment. The absence of the (002) reflection is not uncommon in systems where there are both hydro- and polyfluorocarbon chain fragments.23
If the sample was cooled further to room temperature, the pattern remained essentially unmodified and no further reflections appeared at wider angles (Fig. 3), suggesting that the salt tends to form a glassy mesophase. Interestingly, no crystallisation occurred even after storing the sample for several days at room temperature (see ESI, Fig. S1†).

In Fig. 2 (bottom) a model of this lamellar arrangement is proposed that takes into account the phase segregation between the hydrocarbon (HC) and polyfluorocarbon (FC) chains linked to the imidazolium core. The HR cryo-TEM and PXRD results are perfectly consistent with a spacing of about 2 nm between the layers resulting from the partial interdigitation of the chains into the HC and FC layers.
In order to verify whether the salt [RH8ImC3RF6]+I− may be suitable for the DSSC application, we prepared a I−/I3− redox couple electrolyte by homogenising [RH8ImC3RF6]+I− and I2 in a 4:1 molar ratio at 393 K. The obtained FIL redox electrolyte was then analysed by DSC and variable-temperature PXRD analysis to probe the effect of I2 addition on the salt's [RH8ImC3RF6]+I− mesophase nature and stability. Interestingly, the DSC trace of the FIL redox electrolyte is perfectly reproducible over several cycles and shows a shift of the Cr–LC transition to a lower temperature (ΔT = 21 K), leaving the clearing point of the mesophase substantially unaffected compared to the pure FIL (Fig. 4, left). The PXRD pattern of the FIL redox electrolyte shows that the 001 and 003 pseudo-Bragg peaks are in exactly the same places compared to the pure salt [RH8ImC3RF6]+I− (Fig. 4, right), which implies that the lamellar structure of the mesophase is maintained upon the addition of I2.
 Fig. 4  Left: DSC trace of a 4:1 molar mixture of [RH8ImC3RF6]+I−–I2 (red), compared to the pure salt [RH8ImC3RF6]+I− (black line), recorded on heating mode. Right: variable temperature PXRD analysis of a 4:1 molar mixture of [RH8ImC3RF6]+I−–I2 on cooling from the isotropic phase (over 392 K, black line). 
It is well known that the addition of I2 to an I− salt leads to the formation of triiodide ions and more complex polyiodide species,24,25i.e.: mI2 + nI− → I2m+nn− (m and n integers > 0, n = 1–4)(1)
Looking at the arrangement of molecules in the packed layers that we have described in the model shown in Fig. 2, we may speculate that the polyiodide species formed in the 4:1 [RH8ImC3RF6]+I−–I2 mixture are confined in anisotropic long-range conductive pathways between the SmA layers. In order to prove that the exchange reaction of I− + I3− → I3− + I− may occur in the pathways between the SmA layers of [RH8ImC3RF6]+I−–I2, comb-shaped platinum electrodes supported on a glass plate were used to measure the ionic conductivity along the direction parallel to the homeotropically aligned SmA layers at temperatures ranging from 315 to 420 K.5 In this way the charge diffusion coefficient (D) can be calculated from the steady-state current flow between the two electrodes.26
A plot of D as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 5. On cooling the 4:1 [RH8ImC3RF6]+I−–I2 mixture from the isotropic phase, D gradually decreases with the decrease in temperature, however a clear discontinuity was observed at temperatures starting from around 380 K, which corresponds roughly to the isotropic-to-LC phase transition (Iso–LC). As reported already for ionic liquid electrolytes containing I−/I3− redox couples, D can be split in two different components, the physical diffusion coefficient (Dphys) and the exchange-reaction diffusion coefficient (Dex).9,27 Taking into account that Dphys decreases exponentially as the temperature is reduced,28 the discontinuity corresponding to the Iso–LC transition should be due to an additional contribution of Dex. This extra contribution could be attributed to the electron conductive pathways organized in the lamellar structure of the 4:1 [RH8ImC3RF6]+I−–I2 mixture and promoting the exchange reaction at the pathways.27

Finally, in order to prove the functionality of these materials, we tested the FILC redox electrolyte in a DSSC,29 where a low-absorption coefficient dye was used as a light absorber (see ESI†). Though the device architecture was not optimised for a solid regenerating medium, e.g. photoanode thickness, mesostructure, the assembled DSSC delivered a photocurrent of about 5.4 mA cm−2 and an efficiency of 1.72% (see ESI, Fig. S2†), which is comparable with the values previously reported for ILC-based DSSCs.8,9
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have reported a series of 1-alkyl-3-polyfluoroalkyl imidazolium iodide ionic liquids with the general formula [RHpImCHqRFr]+I−. By changing p, q, and r systematically, we discovered that several combinations resulted in compounds showing a SmA phase, which has been characterised by polarised optical microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction analysis, among others. In particular, the salt [RH8ImC3RF6]+I− is liquid crystalline in the temperature range of 318–380 K, which is nicely within the operational temperature range of photovoltaic devices. Interestingly, the addition of I2 to [RH8ImC3RF6]+I− does not suppress liquid crystallinity, as was the case for previously reported systems, but, instead, extends the mesophase temperature range to 90 K by suppression of the melting point. Anisotropic ionic conductivity has been proposed to occur in the obtained fluorinated ionic liquid crystal (FILC) redox electrolyte, where the exchange reaction I− + I3− → I3− + I− is promoted within the conductive pathways of the mesophase lamellar structure. Furthermore, the tendency of the FILC redox electrolyte to supercool allows for keeping the long-range order also in the solid film at ambient temperatures. This valuable feature makes the reported FILC redox electrolyte extremely appealing for exploitation not only in solar cells, but also in many other electronic devices, like supercapacitors and lithium batteries.30–32
