    , Accepted 4th June 2020First published on 5th June 2020AbstractAmong post-lithium ion batteries, magnesium ion batteries (MIBs) are receiving growing attention due to their divalent nature, intrinsic low cost, dendrite free cycling, and atmospheric stability. However, their realization is constrained because of the absence of suitable cathodes that can accommodate Mg2+ with fast reversibility. To bypass the sluggish movement of Mg2+ ions inside the cathode and utilize the full advantage of the Mg anode, a Mg2+/Li+ hybrid ion battery (MLIB) is introduced here with rationally designed porous Ni/Zn co-doped CoS2@C spheres as the cathode material. The Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathode with high porosity and electrical conductivity showed an appreciable specific capacity of 158 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1 for MIBs, which was significantly boosted up to 667 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 by employing Mg2+/Li+ hybrid electrolytes. Their specific capacity and the corresponding energy density (614 W h Kg−1) are the highest among MLIBs and comparable to those of lithium ion batteries. Furthermore, MLIBs displayed significant cycling stability by retaining the maximum specific capacities of 324.6 and 230 mA h g−1 at 100 and 500 mA g−1, respectively after 100 cycles. The excellent electrochemical properties of the synthesized cathodes are attributed to their high porosities and electrical conductivities, the synergistic effect of doped species and their capability to accommodate both Mg2+ and Li+ ions without side reactions. Various ex situ characterization tools were employed to develop further understanding of the intercalation chemistries and mechanisms of both Mg2+ and Li+ ions inside host materials.
Introduction
Practical utilization of renewable energy technologies especially solar energy requires rechargeable batteries with a long cycle life and low cost. Currently, rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are fulfilling these necessities; however the extensive and ever increasing demand for portable electronics has compelled researchers to find alternatives to lithium technology.1,2 Furthermore, limited lithium reserves in the Earth's crust make this technology more expensive. The multivalent ion batteries such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+, and Zn2+ could act ideal energy storage systems as post-lithium chemistries.3 Among these new technologies, divalent Mg2+ has the smallest ionic radius, which is about 0.72 Å. Thus, magnesium ion batteries (MIBs) have emerged as ideal candidates due to their high volumetric energy density (3833 mA h cm−3), low redox potential and dendrite free cycling.4 More importantly, magnesium is light, stable, and abundant in the Earth's crust compared with lithium.
Inspired by these advantages, Aurbach et al.5 explored whether the Chevrel phase Mo3S4 cathode can accommodate guest Mg ions, thus resulting in a battery that exhibited a capacity of 110 mA h g−1 with a stable plateau at about 1.0 volt. After the pioneering work by Aurbach, substantial advancements have been made in the synthesis of cathodes6–11 and electrolytes12–14 to achieve high electrochemical performance. Despite these efforts, MIBs are unable to deliver high specific capacities owing to the complex intercalation chemistry of divalent Mg2+ ions.15 The strong electrostatic interactions between divalent Mg2+ ions and cathode lattices lead to sluggish diffusion and trapping of guest Mg2+ ions which ultimately causes MIBs to deliver low capacities.11,16,17 Similar observations were made for trivalent Al3+ ions, because most of the host lattice materials which are compatible with Li+ ions are electrochemically incompatible with divalent (Mg2+) and trivalent (Al3+) ions.17 A practical solution to this problem lies in the joint chemistry of both Mg2+ and Li+ ions called a hybrid ion or dual-salt system. This strategy is attractive because it combines the advantages such as dendrite free plating of the magnesium anode and fast intercalation of Li+ ions at cathode materials, thus achieving high specific capacities.18–21
In the recent past, several dual-salt batteries have been introduced with different cathodes such as MnO2/CNTs,4 Mo6S8,22 MoS2/graphene,23 VO2,24 TiS2,25 TiO2,26 and Li4Ti5O1227 exhibiting the maximum reversible capacities of 175, 120, 300, 244.4, 160, 190, and 180 mA h g−1, respectively. It is apparent that these capacities still need improvement to match those of conventional LIBs.28–30 The reduced charge storage could be attributed to the electrochemical incompatibility of employed cathodes with either magnesium or lithium salts.16 Therefore, it is necessary to synthesize cathode materials that can accommodate both Mg2+ and Li+ ions without side reactions, which is the focus of this study. Transition metal sulfides have been extensively employed as cathode materials for energy storage devices owing to their high theoretical capacities.31,32 Among these metal sulfides, cobalt sulfide (CoS2) has emerged as an excellent material due to its superior electrical and electrochemical properties (theoretical capacity of 870 mA h g−1), and has been widely used in lithium ion storage.33–36 Unfortunately like other metal sulfides, cobalt sulfide anodes also undergo considerable volume expansion, which results in electrode pulverization during the insertion of guest ions, leading to poor cycle life and dramatic capacity fading.37 To overcome these drawbacks, several strategies have been employed including downsizing to nanoscale, employing graphene or carbon nanotube composites, and carbonaceous frameworks etc.38 Despite these advancements, the synthesis of CoS2 embedded in porous carbon spheres is urgently needed for post-lithium ion batteries.
Herein, we employed the transition metal chalcogenide (TMC) approach to grow cobalt sulfide based nanoparticles inside a porous carbon matrix. A porous carbon framework not only provides buffer for volumetric changes but also facilitates the fast transportation of guest ions and electrons. As a result, the synergetic effect of active and conductive materials leads to an improved electrochemical performance of cathodes. It is worth mentioning that in this study, we employed cobalt sulfide embedded in a porous carbon framework as the cathode material for Mg and Mg/Li hybrid ion batteries. Furthermore, doping of Zn, Ni, and Ni/Zn into CoS2 nanospheres was performed to boost up their electrochemical activity in MIBs. When Ni/Zn-CoS2@C was applied as the cathode material, the maximum specific capacities of 158.67 mA h g−1 (at 20 mA g−1) and 660.1 mA h g−1 (at 50 mA g−1) were delivered by MIBs and MLIBs, respectively, which correspond to a specific energy of 614 W h Kg−1. Furthermore, the reversible capacity was retained at 324.60 mA h g−1 even after 100 cycles. Such values of capacities (in terms of rate and cycling performance) are unprecedented and make Ni/Zn-CoS2@C a promising cathode material for Mg batteries.
Experimental methods
Material synthesis
All chemical reagents used for the synthesis were of analytical grade and used in as received form without further purification. CoS2@C spheres were synthesized through a facile single step hydrothermal reaction. In a typical synthesis process, 0.69 mmol cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) and thioacetamide (TAA, C2H5NS, 4 mmol) were mixed in isopropanol (70 mL) and a homogeneous suspension was obtained by sonication. Glycerol (C3H8O3, 16 mL) was then added dropwise under vigorous magnetic stirring to obtain a light pink solution. The solution was hydrothermally treated at 180 °C for 6 hours and dark brown precipitates of CoS2@C spheres were collected and washed by centrifugation, followed by drying under vacuum at 70 °C. For Ni-CoS2@C or Zn-CoS2@C spheres, nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.23 mmol) or zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.23 mmol) was added along with 0.57 mmol cobalt nitrate. Moreover, for Ni/Zn-CoS2@C spheres 0.12 mmol each of nickel nitrate and zinc nitrate were added in addition to 0.57 mmol cobalt nitrate. All other reactant contents and the whole synthesis process remain the same.
Materials characterization
The phase composition and crystallographic measurements were made using a PAN analytical X'Pert-3 Powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 45 kV accelerating voltage and 200 mA current. A transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai F30) equipped with a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM, Titan Cubed Themis G2 300) and a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Merlin Compact) equipped with an EDS detector were employed to analyze the morphology and elemental composition. The elemental composition and oxidation states of the material were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Kratos Axis Ultra with monochromatized Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). The BET-Quantachrome autosorb-IQ gas adsorption analyzer at 77 K was used to calculate the specific surface areas and pore size distribution through the N2 sorption test. All samples were evacuated at 200 °C for 3 hours under dynamic vacuum before the adsorption test. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to evaluate sulfur loading using an SDTQ600 analyzer under an inert atmosphere from 30–800 °C at a 5 °C min−1 increase in temperature.
Electrochemical characterization
CoS2 based active materials (70%) were ground with conductive carbon Super-P (10%) and then added to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (20%) based slurry in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). The mixture was blended for 5 hours and then coated onto graphite foils using a doctor-blade method. After drying overnight at 60 °C, as coated foil was punched into 10 mm diameter electrodes. The total mass loading was about 1.0 mg cm−2.
All-phenyl-complex (APC) electrolytes were prepared in an argon-filled glove box with oxygen and water contents less than 1 ppm. Firstly, the AlCl3–tetrahydrofuran (AlCl3–THF) complex (99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, China) was mixed with the PhMgCl–THF complex (99.9%, Aladdin) in a molar ratio of 1:2 and then additional THF (99.9%, Aladdin) was added and stirred for 48 hours to obtain 0.4 M concentration of APC electrolytes. For the preparation of a Mg2+/Li+ hybrid electrolyte, 1.0 M anhydrous LiCl was dissolved in 0.4 M APC solution using magnetic stirring.
Magnesium discs with 16 mm diameter were cleaned using sand papers inside a glove box and used as the anode. Coin cells were assembled using CoS2 based electrodes as the positive electrode, Mg discs as the negative electrode, and commercially available glass microfiber filters (GF/C) and APC or APC-LiCl as electrolytes. All experiments were carried out in an argon-filled glove box. Freshly prepared half-cells were aged for 4 hours and then tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis using an electrochemical (CHI611E) workstation. The voltage range was set between 0 and 2.0 V and different scan rates (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mV s−1) were applied. LAND battery testing stations (LANHE) were used for electrochemical measurements. Electrostatic charging/discharging analysis was carried out in terms of rate performance (applied current densities range from 20 to 1000 mA g−1 for MIBs and from 50 to 2500 mA g−1 for MLIBs) and cycle life between 0.05 and 2.0 V at room temperature. The cell impedances were analyzed using an analytical electrochemical interface solartron (SI1287) apparatus between 0.01 to 1 × 106 Hz frequency range and at 10 mV AC amplitude.
Results and discussion
The synthesis process of Ni/Zn doped cobalt sulfide nanoparticle decorated carbon spheres (CoS2@C, Ni-CoS2@C, Zn-CoS2@C, and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C) is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1a. The spheres were prepared by a simple hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C using metal nitrates (metal source) and thioacetamide (sulfur source) in the presence of glycerol (growth controlling agent). After the hydrothermal reaction for 6 h, the dark brown precipitates of cobalt sulfide nanoparticle decorated carbon spheres were collected and further annealed to get rid of the volatile content and increase the porosities. The structural morphologies of the synthesized spheres were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as shown in Fig. 1b–e and Fig. S1.† It can be seen that CoS2@C, Ni-CoS2@C, Zn-CoS2@C, and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C spheres consist of a smooth surface having a uniform size of about 200 nm (Fig. S1a, b, e, f, i, j† and Fig. 1b and c). TEM analysis of the annealed samples revealed the preservation of uniform sphere morphologies with a granular surface and mesoporous structure (Fig. S1c, g, k† and Fig. 1d). The formation of a mesoporous structure will definitely enhance the specific surface area of the nanomaterials, which is highly beneficial for guest ion transportation. Careful observation revealed that the size of granular particles ranges from 10 to 25 nm, and they are interpolated into a carbon network to form spheres. Fig. 1d inset shows clear lattice fringes of Ni/Zn-CoS2@C spheres with an interplanar spacing of 0.276 nm, corresponding to the (200) plane of CoS2. The elemental composition of CoS2@C, Ni-CoS2@C, and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C spheres was determined by STEM elemental mapping (Fig. S1d, S1h,† and Fig. 1e). It can be observed for Ni/Zn-CoS2@C spheres that nickel, zinc, cobalt, and sulfur are uniformly distributed throughout the mesoporous spherical carbon structure (Fig. 1e), indicating uniform doping (of Ni/Zn).

The crystalline nature and phase structure of the synthesized nanomaterials were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) as shown in Fig. 1f. All the diffraction peaks of different samples correspond to the cubic phase of CoS2 (PDF # 41-1471; space group: Pa(205)). It can be observed that Ni doping of the CoS2@C spheres has broadened the peaks with slight reduction in intensities. However, doping of element Zn or Ni/Zn into CoS2@C has increased the intensities of the diffraction peaks with a small shift in peak positions. It is obvious that there is no additional peak corresponding to the element Zn, Ni or any new phase, which might be attributed to their low contents, and also because of the similar ionic radius and electronegativity of the doping metal ions (Ni2+, Zn2+) that could replace Co2+ ions. To further validate the presence of doping elements (Zn, Ni) inside CoS2@C spheres and their valence states, XPS analysis was carried out as shown in Fig. 2 and S2.† The survey scan of CoS2@C spheres (Fig. 2a) clearly indicates the presence of C 1s, Co 2p, S 2p, and N 1s peaks, whereas the XPS survey of Ni/Zn-CoS2@C indicates the presence of additional peaks corresponding to Ni 2p and Zn 2p. Typical fitted C 1s spectra of all samples show the CO (288.84 eV), C–O/C–N/C–S (286.30 eV), and C–C (284.75 eV) peaks (Fig. 2b and S2a†). Moreover, the intensity of the peak is at 286.3 eV for the Ni/Zn doped sample. The presence of the C–N bond and nitrogen peaks (N 1s in Fig. 2a) revealed the existence of the nitrogen doped carbon matrix. The fitted spectra of N 1s consist of pyridinic N and pyrrolic N doped in the carbon matrix with binding energies at 399.86 and 401.85 eV, respectively (Fig. S2b†).39,40 The Co 2p spectra of all samples consist of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks, which are deconvoluted into two peaks corresponding to Co3+ (781.73 and 797.71 eV) and Co2+ (779.43 and 794.36 eV), respectively in addition to satellite peaks at 786.81 and 802.79 eV (Fig. 2c and S2c†).41 The S 2p spectra can be deconvoluted into 2p3/2 (ST−1/S2−) and 2p1/2 (SB0/S2−) with binding energies equal to 162.56 and 163.6 eV, respectively, along with the presence of a thiosulfate–polythionate complex peak (at 168.87 eV) (Fig. 2d and Fig. S2 in the ESI†). It is obvious that Ni, Zn or Ni/Zn-doped CoS2@C samples showed a slight shift in the Co3+, Co2+, S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peak positions towards lower binding energies (Fig. 2c, d and Fig. S2f†). This shift is mainly attributed to the change in their oxidation states (higher to lower), which confirms the doping of Ni/Zn cations in the CoS2 structure.42 Similarly, the Ni 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 fitted spectra of Ni-CoS2@C and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C (Fig. S2d†) consist of peaks at binding energies equal to 853.87 and 871.39 eV (for Ni2+) and 856.44 and 874.92 eV (for Ni3+), respectively with reduction in the Ni3+ peak intensity for the Ni/Zn doped sample.43 Fig. 2Se† shows the fitted spectra of Zn 2p of Zn-CoS2@C and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C spheres, which consist of Zn3/2 and Zn1/2 peaks with binding energies equal to 1022.1 and 1045.11 eV, respectively. The XPS results are consistent with the STEM mapping results, confirming the doping of Ni/Zn elements.

To evaluate the specific surface area and pore size distribution of CoS2@C, Ni-CoS2@C, Zn-CoS2@C, and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C spheres, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique was employed as shown in Fig. S3.† The nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms of spheres show type IV BET classification (Fig. S3a–d†). The BET isotherms indicated the porous nature of materials (generated by partial removal of the carbon matrix during the annealing process), which is highly beneficial for guest ion transportation during the redox reactions. The BET specific surface areas of CoS2@C, Ni-CoS2@C, Zn-CoS2@C, and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C spheres were found to be 27.27, 45.46, 39.88, and 49.38 m2 g−1, respectively. Fig. S3e–h† show the pore size distribution curves with the pore size ranging from 2 to 12 nm. The synthesized materials were also evaluated by TG analysis between 30 and 800 °C at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 as shown in Fig. S4.† The initial weight loss below 200 °C was attributed to the removal of water vapor adsorbed onto the surface. The second weight loss between 200 and 350 °C was attributed to the evaporation of sulfur. The third weight loss between 350 and 650 °C corresponds to the combustion of the carbon matrix from the spheres. Based on this TG analysis, the weight percentage of the carbon matrix was found to be around 26.4, 23.7, 23.06, and 20.0% inside the CoS2@C, Ni-CoS2@C, Zn-CoS2@C, and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C spheres, respectively. These amounts of carbon were optimum enough to enhance the electrical conductivities of cobalt sulfide based materials. TG observation also confirmed that Ni/Zn-CoS2@C was the most stable material among others with an appropriate amount of carbon, which is highly beneficial to achieve higher electrochemical performance.
The electrochemical reactions taking place during the charge–discharge process of Ni/Zn-CoS2@C∥APC∥Mg and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C∥APC-LiCl∥Mg half-cells were analyzed through cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests at different scan rates (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mV s−1). The potential window was set as 0 to 2.0 V. Fig. S5a† presents the oxidation and reduction reactions of the Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathode in all-phenyl-complex (APC) electrolytes (Ni/Zn-CoS2@C∥APC∥Mg). It can be noticed that the Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathode in MIBs goes through multi-step intercalation/de-intercalations of Mg2+ ions as confirmed by the redox peaks at ∼1.41, ∼0.81 V (oxidation) and ∼0.51, ∼0.25 V (reduction). The positions of redox peaks change slightly with the number of cycles, and their intensities are very low which could be attributed to the bivalency of Mg2+ ions, as a result sluggish reaction kinetics was observed.44 These peaks correspond to the small plateaus present in the charge/discharge curves. CV tests carried out at different scan rates (Fig. S5b†) can be used further to quantify the capacitive or diffusive charge storage. The relationship between applied scan rates (v) and peak currents (i) can be stated as follows.45 i = a·vb(1) logi = loga + blogv(2)where a and b are adjustable constants, and the b value represents the slope of log (v) − log (i) plots. b = 1.0 represents the capacitive/surface controlled reactions also known as the faradaic redox process. The log (v) − log (i) plots of Ni/Zn-CoS2@C∥APC∥Mg half-cells are presented in Fig. S5c,† and they represent the b-value equal to 0.6552, 0.8645, and 0.7526. Among these, the cathodic b-value (0.6552) signifies both partial capacitive and partial diffusion controlled behaviors. Moreover, quantitative analysis can be used to estimate the ratios of capacitive contribution and diffusion contribution separately using the following equation: i = k1·(v) + k2·(v)0.5(3)where i is the current at a fixed potential, v is the scan rate, and k1 and k2 are constants. The factors k1·(v) and k2·(v)0.5 represent the capacitive and diffusion controlled contributions respectively. The ratios of capacitive to diffusion contributions are quantified and depicted in Fig. S5d and e,† which revealed that the capacitive behavior increases with the increase in scan rates. The high capacitive behavior is beneficial for long-term stability because it helps to retain the structure of cathode materials.

Fig. 3a shows the cyclic voltammogram of Ni/Zn-CoS2@C∥APC-LiCl∥Mg half-cells at 0.5 mV s−1. The first cycle exhibits oxidation peaks at 1.7 and 1.20 V, and the corresponding reduction peaks appear at 0.47 and 0.88 V. The first cycle is different from subsequent cycles, which can be attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The subsequent cycles reveal slightly shifted oxidation peaks (at 1.77 and 1.38 V) and reduction peaks (at 0.94 and 0.51 V). The intensity of redox peaks decreases (with the number of cycles), which corresponds well with charging/discharging profiles as shown in Fig. 3c–e. Fig. S6a† shows the CV curves of a hybrid cell at different scan rates. Eqn (1) and (2) were used to estimate b-values by plotting log (v) − log (i) for anode and cathode reactions as shown in Fig. S6b.† The estimated b-values were found to be 0.91, 0.77, 0.89 and 0.79, which means that cathodic currents are dominated by surface controlled reactions. Furthermore, eqn (3) was used to quantify the capacitive and diffusion controlled contribution ratios for a hybrid battery as shown in Fig. S6c and d.† It can be seen that even at a low scan rate (0.1 mV s−1), the capacitive contribution is about 67.11%, which increases to 82.02% when the scan rate reaches 1.0 mV s−1. The surface controlled reactions occurring in the hybrid battery result in better long-term cycling behaviors as confirmed by the cycling stability.

To illustrate the potential of the as synthesized pristine CoS2@C and Ni, Zn, or Ni/Zn co-doped CoS2@C for battery performance, their specific capacities, rate performances, and cycle performance were determined in both APC and APC-LiCl hybrid electrolytes. For determining the rate performance of MIBs applied currents were varied from 20 to 1000 mA g−1 as shown in Fig. 3b. For CoS2@C the discharge capacities were found to be 81.56, 52.51, 37.5, 27.2, 15.6, and 8.12 mA h g−1 at 20, 40, 100, 200, 400, and 1000 mA g−1, respectively. Ni and Zn doped CoS2@C exhibited improved discharge capacities especially at low current densities. It can be observed that the capacities of 131.52 and 120.42 mA h g−1 were obtained at 20 mA g−1, while 68.1 and 67.95 mA h g−1 were achieved at 40 mA g−1 for Ni-CoS2@C and Zn-CoS2@C cathodes, respectively. No significant difference was observed at high current rates because Mg ions cannot diffuse completely into cathode materials. However, when Ni and Zn were co-doped into CoS2@C, a significant improvement in the discharge capacity was observed both at low and high current rates owing to their synergetic effect. Individual or co-doping of transition metal ions (i.e. Ni/Zn) is highly beneficial to improve the electrochemical conductivity and electrochemical performance of the CoS2 cathode. The co-doping of Zn and Ni into the CoS2 cathode is more beneficial owing to their synergetic effects. Zn doping stabilizes the structure of CoS2, minimizes the dissolution of the cation into the electrolyte, and weakens the Li–O bonds, therefore boosting the electrochemical performance,46 whereas Ni doped CoS2 can effectively reduce the charge recombination at the interface (lowering the charge transfer resistance), and Ni acts as a catalyst on the cathode to achieve high capacity, and creates defects in the host crystal structure thus resulting in emptiness (increasing the Mg2+/Li+ diffusion coefficient).47 As a result, Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathodes exhibited the discharge capacities of 158.67, 107.50, 79.47, 61.71, 42.7, and 16.5 mA h g−1 at 20, 40, 100, 200, 400, and 1000 mA g−1 current densities, respectively. The corresponding charging and discharging profiles of Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathodes are presented in Fig. S7a,† where distinct plateaus can be observed and are consistent with small peaks in CV analysis. To further boost up the electrochemical performance and ionic conductivity of the APC electrolyte, an inorganic additive (i.e. lithium chloride) was dissolved in the APC electrolyte (hybrid ion electrolyte) and tests were carried out. Fig. 3c shows the rate performance of Mg2+/Li+ hybrid ion batteries (MLIBs) containing different cathode materials with increasing current density in gradual steps from 50 to 2500 mA g−1. The CoS2@C exhibited the discharge capacities of 424.13, 353.6, 306.85, 248.9, 204.17, and 102.15 mA h g−1 at 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, and 2500 mA g−1 current densities, respectively. When the applied current density returned to the value of 50 mA g−1, the reversible capacity of 344 mA h g−1 was retrieved, showing the high rate capability of the cathode material.
Unlike MIBs, the Ni-CoS2@C based MLIB did not show improvement in the specific capacity compared with pristine CoS2@C. The reason could be the poor stability of nickel cations (nickel dissolution) inside the hybrid ion electrolytes. The Zn-CoS2@C cathode exhibited higher capacities at 50 or 100 mA g−1 and the lowest capacities in the range 500–2500 mA g−1 compared with CoS2@C. The reason could be the capability of zinc to stabilize the structure of CoS2 and minimize the dissolution of cations into the electrolyte at low current rates. Interestingly, Ni/Zn co-doped CoS2@C revealed a significant improvement in reversible capacities. This might be attributed to the synergetic effects, which make the transition metal co-doped cobalt sulfides much stable i.e. the presence of zinc helps to stabilize both nickel and cobalt sulfides, and thus revealed an improved capacity. However, the exact reason is still unknown and further in situ studies are in process to investigate the electrochemical reactions of hybrid ion batteries. As a result, the Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathode exhibited the specific capacities of 660.1, 432.10, 364, 331, 284, and 210 mA h g−1 at 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, and 2500 mA g−1 current densities, respectively. When the applied current density returned to 50 mA g−1, a significantly high reversible capacity of 446 mA h g−1 was retrieved, showing the improved rate capability of the Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathode. Compared with previously reported MLIBs in the literature, our Ni/Zn-CoS2@C based MLIBs displayed excellent and competitive rate capabilities as depicted in Fig. 4a and b. Taking the maximum specific capacity and applied current density into consideration, a comparison was also made with cobalt sulfide and its composite based conventional LIBs reported in the literature as shown in Table S1.† It can be noted that our MLIBs still have the potential to compete with LIBs. Furthermore, a comparison of MIBs and MLIBs in our work confirmed that the addition of inorganic additives (lithium chloride) into APC electrolytes has dramatically enhanced the electrochemical performances of the synthesized cathodes owing to the improved ionic conductivities of electrolytes. The galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of CoS2@C, Ni-CoS2@C, Zn-CoS2@C, and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C at current densities ranging from 50–2500 mA g−1 are depicted in Fig. S7b–S7d,† respectively. Small plateaus in the charging/discharging curves are in good agreement with the redox peaks present in the CV curves which corresponds to diffusion of Li+ ions inside cathode materials.
 Fig. 4  Comparison of the present work with MLIBs reported in the literature as a function of maximum specific capacity (a) and energy density (b). 
Another important electrochemical test is the cycling stability test, which is essential for practical applications. Fig. S8a† shows the cycling stabilities of the synthesized cathodes in APC electrolytes tested at 20 mA g−1 current density for 30 cycles. Unfortunately, all cathodes suffer from capacity fading owing to the formation of un-dissolved magnesium sulfides (MgS) and irreversible structural changes in CoS2.48 Among all cathodes Ni/Zn-CoS2@C still retains the highest value of capacity (60 mA h g−1) after 30 cycles. Furthermore, the same cathode materials were also tested in hybrid ion electrolytes (APC-LiCl) at 100 and 500 mA g−1 current density for 100 cycles as shown in Fig. S8b† and Fig. 3e, respectively. Specific capacities decayed for all cathodes in the first few cycles (Fig. S8b†), which is in good agreement with previous reports,49 where it was found that if the discharge cut-off voltage is 1.60 V, then the possible intercalation reaction at the CoS2 based cathode could be established as CoS2 + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixCoS2. Thus, the structure of the cathode material is fully retained. However, when the discharge cut-off voltage is 0.02 V, then the possible intercalation reaction at the cathode could be written as CoS2 + 4Li+ + 4e− ↔ Co + 2Li2S. Thus, setting a lower discharge voltage will collapse the structure of CoS2 based cathodes.49,50 It can be noticed that the hybrid ion electrolyte strategy enhances stabilities that are more obvious during long term cycling compared to the APC electrolyte. As a result, the CoS2@C, Ni-CoS2@C, Zn-CoS2@C, and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathodes retained the reversible capacities of 195, 197.5, 120.50, and 324.60 mA h g−1, respectively even after 100 cycles (Fig. S8b†). Similarly, the capacities of 169.57, 105.2, 104.32, and 230 mA h g−1 were retained by CoS2@C, Ni-CoS2@C, Zn-CoS2@C, and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathodes, respectively after 100 cycles in hybrid electrolytes at a current density of 500 mA g−1 (Fig. 3e). Careful analysis revealed that the best capacity retentions were exhibited by CoS2@C (63.6%) and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C (72.5%) cathodes for 100 cycles.
To know the potential advantage of any work, comparison with previous works and conventional batteries is very important. Therefore, we have plotted the maximum specific capacity versus applied current rates against those for previously investigated MLIBs in Fig. 4a.4,22–26,51–61 The present work is represented by green color pillars, which clearly indicate that the Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathode with a maximum capacity of 667 mA h g−1 has made a milestone achievement in magnesium ion technology, and is even able to compete with conventional LIBs (Table S1†). Furthermore, energy densities and power densities are plotted against Mg2+/Li+ hybrid batteries reported in the literature (Fig. 4b).4,23,24,55,59–62 The green pillars revealed that our MLIBs could deliver a maximum energy density of 614 W h Kg−1, which not only beats the state-of-the-art Mg2+/Li+ hybrid batteries, but also conventional Mg and Al ion batteries.5,63 Based on excellent energy densities delivered by the Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathode, the present work may open new horizons for hybrid ion batteries, which have great potential to replace LIBs.
The electrochemical reaction kinetics of cobalt sulfide based cathodes was further studied using ex situ X-ray diffraction techniques. The electrodes were charged and discharged to different potentials and then removed to examine the phase changes. Fig. 5a presents the ex situ XRD analysis of the Zn-CoS2@C cathode in the APC electrolyte. It can be noted that the Zn-CoS2@C cathode powder exhibits clear diffraction peaks at two theta equal to 32.30 (200), 36.23 (210), 39.82 (211), and 46.32° (220), which correspond to PDF#41-1471 and the space group: Pa(205). The XRD profile of the cathode charged to 0.70 V revealed a change in the peak positions towards the left side (two theta equals to 31.92 and 35.83°). When the cathode was fully charged (2.0 V), the peak present at 35.83° two theta slightly shifts towards the right side due to extraction of Mg2+ ions. Small changes in the peak position confirmed the small amount of extracted Mg2+ ions, which is in good agreement with the previous report where trapping of Mg2+ ions was observed.11 When the cathode was discharged to about 0 V, the peaks at 31.92° and 35.9° shifted to 31.80° and 35.66°, respectively. Furthermore, the intensities of both peaks were increased, which confirms the insertion of Mg2+ ions into the Zn-CoS2@C cathode. In the discharged state, new peaks appeared at 34.44° (200) and 49.53° (220) two theta, which correspond to the presence of MgS (PDF#35-0730; space group: Fmm(225)). Moreover, a peak corresponding to Co (PDF#15-0806; space group: Fm3m(225)) was also observed at 44.21° (111). Intensities of both the Co and MgS peaks were comparatively very small, which means that only small fractions of the Mg2+ ion were fully diffused into the Zn-CoS2@C cathode, leading to the collapse of the host material. Based on the above results and discussion, we propose that the insertion of Mg2+ ions into the CoS2 cathode is a two-step reaction, where the first step is the conversion of CoS2 into CoS and the next step is CoS transformation into Co. These results are consistent with previous reports64,65 and the overall reaction during the discharging process can be summarized as follows: CoS2 + Mg2+ + 2e− ↔ CoS + MgS(4) CoS + Mg2+ + 2e− ↔ Co + MgS(5)
 Fig. 5  
Ex situ XRD analysis of Zn-CoS2@C (a) and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C (b) cathodes at different charge–discharge stages (Zn-CoS2@C∥APC∥Mg, Ni/Zn-CoS2@C∥APC-LiCl∥Mg). 
For hybrid ion batteries, the Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathode was chosen for ex situ XRD analysis as shown in Fig. 5b. Once again, clear diffraction peaks were observed at two theta values equal to 32.30 (200), 36.23 (210), 39.82 (211), and 46.32° (220), which correspond to PDF#41-1471 and the space group: Pa(205). When the cathode was charged to 0.80 V, the peak at 32.30° shifted towards right, i.e. 32.43° two theta. With further charging of the cathode to 2.0 V, the intensity of the peak was decreased significantly owing to the extraction of guest ions. In the fully charged state, a strong peak at 2θ equal to 34.44° (200) was observed, which matches well with PDF#35-0730 and the space group: Fmm(225) of MgS. When the cathode was discharged to about 0 V, the intensity of the peak at 2θ equal to 32.43° became stronger, and that of MgS almost vanished. Additional peaks at 2θ equal to 44.76° (002) and 47.56° (101) appeared, which correspond to Co (PDF#05-0727; space group: P63/mmc(194)). Furthermore, the Li2S (PDF#23-0369; space group: Fm(225)) peaks at 31.24° (200) and 44.78° (220) confirmed the insertion of Li+ ions into the Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathode. This is in good agreement with the possible intercalation reaction at the cathode, which could be written as.49,50 CoS2 + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ CoSx + Li2S(6) CoSx + 2xLi+ + 2xe− ↔ Co + xLi2S(7)
To further study the structural and elemental changes in cobalt sulfide based cathodes (Ni/Zn-CoS2@C), the cycled electrodes were characterized using SEM with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) in the charged and discharged states as shown in Fig. S9 and Table S2.† Fig. S9a† shows the surface morphology of the Ni/Zn-CoS2@C electrode before cycling. It can be seen that small round spheres of about 300–500 nm are uniformly embedded in the binder matrix. Its elemental composition is confirmed by EDS analysis as shown in Table S2.† When the electrode was fully discharged (Fig. S9b†), the shape and volume of spheres were changed, which confirmed the diffusion of guest ions into the cathode (EDS and Table S2†). A large amount of the element Mg was traced. However, charging the electrode to about 2.0 V, revealed the existence of the Mg element in minute quantities (Fig. S9c and Table S2†), which is due to trapping of the Mg2+ ion complex inside the electrode as confirmed by ex situ XRD analysis.11 The possible Mg2+ ion complex can be written as (8)
Furthermore, the electrode material could not retain the original shape of the sphere during cycling owing to the collapse of cobalt sulfide structures as discussed above.
The resistance faced by cells during the charge transfer process was analyzed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as shown in Fig. S10a and b.† The Nyquist plots of the CoS2@C, Ni-CoS2@C, Zn-CoS2@C, and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathodes in APC (MIBs) and APC-LiCl hybrid electrolytes (MLIBs) display semicircles in the high frequency regions, which represent the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) during redox reactions. Fig. S10a† reveals that MIBs exhibit large semi-circles confirming the large charge-transfer resistance (Rct) faced by Mg2+ ions during insertion into host materials. CoS2@C shows the largest value of Rct (116.5 kΩ) as examined using z-view software, whereas the Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathode exhibits the smallest Rct (65.6 kΩ) value, implying the rapid charge transfer process owing to the high electrical conductivity of the electrode. Compared to MIBs, the MLIBs revealed a much lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct) as shown in Fig. S10b.† The Rct value of CoS2@C was reduced from 116.5 kΩ to 7.42 kΩ, when using hybrid electrolytes. Similar to MIBs, the Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathode exhibits the lowest Rct value of 4.11 kΩ in hybrid electrolytes. The EIS results indicate that the addition of inorganic additives (LiCl) has significantly decreased the Rct value by increasing the ionic conductivity of electrolytes as discussed above.62 The electrodes with the lowest values revealed the highest values of reversible capacities as proved by the electrochemical properties of cobalt sulfide based electrodes.
Like the positive electrode, the characterization of the negative electrode (magnesium anode) is of great interest because magnesiation/de-magnesiation occurs here during electroplating. The possible reaction at the magnesium anode can be written as Mg ↔ Mg2+ + 2e−. However, the hybrid electrolyte also contains Li+ ions which may also be deposited at the Mg anode. According to J. H. Cho et al.22 an estimated overpotential of 0.68 V is required by Li+ ions during the charging process. The magnesium–lithium alloying reaction is possible if the above mentioned potential difference can be vanished. Thus, the surface of the magnesium anode was examined using SEM and XRD before and after cycling in hybrid electrolytes as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S11.† The SEM analysis of the cycled anode revealed the formation of microspores on its surface because of the acidic nature of APC electrolytes. However, no apparent dendrite formation was observed due to the hexagonal close packed (HCP) structure of magnesium during stripping/deposition,62 which makes MIB and MLIBs much safer than LIBs. Fig. S11† shows the XRD profile of the cycled anode, which confirmed the absence of the Mg–Li second phase or the alloying product. Thus, only magnesium is deposited and stripped at the Mg metal anode.

Conclusions
In conclusion, Ni, Zn, and Ni/Zn co-doped cobalt sulfide nanoparticles incorporated into highly porous carbon spheres were successfully synthesized using the one-step hydrothermal method. The synthesized CoS2@C, Ni-CoS2@C, Zn-CoS2@C, and Ni/Zn-CoS2@C spheres exhibited a highly crystalline structure, a high specific surface area, and sufficient porosities with enough space to accommodate the guest ions. These nanomaterials were employed as the positive electrode against the magnesium anode in Mg-ion and Mg–Li hybrid-ion batteries in the presence of all-phenyl-complex based electrolyte solutions. The experimental results revealed that Ni/Zn-CoS2@C cathodes revealed the maximum specific capacities of 158 mA h g−1 and 667 mA h g−1 in APC and APC-LiCl electrolytes, respectively with a coulombic efficiency of more than 99.5%. Furthermore, the resultant batteries exhibited good cycling performance and a specific energy of 614 W h Kg−1, which is significantly promising compared with previously reported MLIBs. Combined with the dendrite free magnesiation/de-magnesiation process and the rational design of the positive electrode with impressive energy density achievement, this work will step forward the advancement of magnesium-ion batteries as a safe electrochemical energy storage system.
