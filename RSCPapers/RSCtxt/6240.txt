    , Accepted 8th September 2015First published on 8th September 2015AbstractEnhanced nonlinear refractive indices and absorption coefficients of nonstoichiometric SixC1−x with varying C/Si composition ratios from 0.51 to 1.83 grown by low-temperature plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition are demonstrated. When increasing the [CH4]/[CH4 + SiH4] fluence ratio from 70% to 92%, two Raman scattering signals at 795 and 970 cm−1 contributed by transverse and longitudinal optical modes of Si–C bonds are simultaneously enhanced in stoichiometric and C-rich SixC1−x samples, whereas the Si-associated Raman peak at 520 cm−1 decreases with increasing C/Si composition ratio. The C-rich SixC1−x film shows additional Raman scattering peaks at 1330 and 1580 cm−1, which are individually contributed by the diamond-like C–C bonds and the G peak of the graphite-like C–C bonds, respectively. The nonlinear refractive index increases to 1 ± 0.1 × 10−11 cm2 W−1 upon increasing the C/Si composition ratio up to 1.83, which is four orders of magnitude higher than that of bulk SiC. The increased C/Si composition ratio reduces the lattice constant and the effective mass of the SixC1−x film and enhances its nonlinear refractive index effectively. In comparison with the sp3-orbital C–C bond, the sp2-orbital C–C bond in SixC1−x films dominates the enhancement of nonlinear refractive index. By contrast, the nonlinear absorption coefficient changes sign and decreases magnitude when transferring the SixC1−x film from Si-rich to C-rich conditions. This sign reversal is primarily attributed to the conversion in the absorption mechanism from two-photon absorption to nonlinear saturable absorption. Unlike Si–Si bonds which favor two-photon absorption, the sp2-orbital C–C bonds with delocalized π-electrons essentially enhance the saturable absorbance. Hence, a higher nonlinear refractive index and a higher saturable absorption coefficient can be obtained by enriching the sp2-orbital C–C bonds in C-rich SixC1−x films.
Introduction
Nonstoichiometric silicon carbide (SixC1−x) materials have been comprehensively investigated in recent years because of their tunable C/Si composition ratio and variable bandgap suitable for versatile optoelectronic applications,1 high electron velocity suitable for high-speed operations,2 high breakdown electric fields with a high damage threshold,3 and controllable n- or p-type doping concentrations for different device configurations.4 These features present SixC1−x as a potential candidate for functional electronic and optoelectronic devices. Previously, most research focused on employing SixC1−x in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells, and field-effect transistors. Kruangam et al. preliminary observed the electroluminescent color of p-i-n a-SiC LEDs varying from red to green.5 Tai et al. used Si-rich SixC1−x films with buried Si and SiC quantum dots as the active layer for improving the external quantum efficiency of LEDs to 1.58 × 10−1%.6 In 2013, Fuchs's group reported that the luminescence of the SiC based single-photon LED is contributed by point defects including Si interstitial related D1 centers and Si vacancies.7 In addition, the Si interstitials can aggregate to form clusters, which can further affect the optical nonlinearity of the SixC1−x film. Gao et al. reported that the semitransparent a-SixC1−x:H based n-i-p solar cells with a conversion efficiency of less than 1% were used as optical-transmittance modulators.8 Cheng et al. optimized the i-SixC1−x thickness to 25 nm in Si-rich SixC1−x-based solar cells for enhancing the filling factor and conversion efficiency to 0.25 and 1.7%, respectively.9 Estrada et al.10 demonstrated SixC1−x based thin-film transistors with a field-effect mobility of up to 1.9 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Furthermore, SixC1−x has been employed in high-temperature and high-power electronics for maintaining device sensitivity and stability under extreme environments because of its superior thermal stability and chemical inertness.11,12
Moreover, for silicon photonics applications in interconnected photonic integrated circuits, versatile group IV materials and devices have been developed for overcoming the electrical transmission speed limitations of silicon.13,14 In particular, the all-optical transmission is one of the solutions. The optical waveguide with high speed transmission can be achieved by using the nonlinear optical properties of materials. Thus, the unique nonlinear optical properties of SixC1−x materials have been investigated for developing SixC1−x based waveguides and modulators.15–18 In 1999, Niedermeier et al. observed the second-order nonlinear coefficients of different SixC1−x polytypes.15 The measured coefficients of (χzzz, χzxx) for 4H- and 6H-SiC were (18, −4) and (24, −4) pm V−1, respectively. Wu et al. calculated the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility of SiC with different polytypes by employing the density functional theory and reported a χxyz(2) of 34.2 pm V−1 for 3C-SiC and a χzzz(2) of 38.6 pm V−1 for 6H-SiC.16 Strait et al. utilized 6H-SiC with a χzzz(2)/χzxx(2) ratio of −3 ± 2.6 for generating terahertz radiation on the basis of its massive optical rectification effect.17 Moreover, the nonlinear optical coefficients of the 4H- and 6H-SiC were also reported by Sato's group.18 The values of (d31, d15, d33) were obtained as (6.7, 6.5, −12.5) pm V−1 for 6H-SiC and (6.5, 6.7, −11.7) pm V−1 for 4H-SiC.18 Some studies have been focused on characterizing the third-order nonlinear optical properties of SixC1−x.19,20 Desautels et al. studied the damage threshold and optical nonlinearity of bulk SixC1−x and measured the nonlinear absorption coefficient and refractive index of 0.064 cm GW−1 and 4.75 × 10−6 cm2 GW−1, for semi-insulating SixC1−x.19 Ding et al. studied the third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility of SixC1−x with different nitrogen (N) doping concentrations.20 By increasing the N concentration to 2 × 1017 cm−3, the real part of the third-order nonlinear susceptibility was improved to 6.16 × 10−13 esu.20 SixC1−x films exhibiting a strong two-photon absorption (TPA) can be employed in all optical modulations.20 Moreover, SixC1−x films with higher saturable absorption served as saturable absorbers in passive mode-locking of fiber lasers.21 The enhanced Kerr effect induces a higher nonlinear refractive index for fabricating nonlinear waveguide devices and ultrafast fiber lasers.22–24 However, whether the SiC can effectively detune its third-order nonlinear susceptibilities and two-photon or nonlinear saturable absorption is unknown.
In this study, the nonlinear refractive indices and absorption coefficients of nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films with the composition changing from the Si- to C-rich conditions were characterized. Nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films with different C/Si composition ratios were grown by using hydrogen-free plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) with relatively low substrate temperatures. Compared with conventional SiC, the nanoscale SixC1−x films analyzed by using femtosecond laser-based Z-scan measurements exhibit an enhancement of several orders of magnitude in their nonlinear optical properties. Moreover, the nonlinear refractive indices and absorption coefficients of C-rich SixC1−x films vary with the type of C–C bond.
Experimental
Nonstoichiometric SixC1−x film preparation
At first, 200-nm-thick SixC1−x films with different C/Si composition ratios were deposited on a 50 μm thick quartz substrate by using hydrogen-free low-temperature PECVD with a gaseous mixture of argon (Ar)-diluted silane (SiH4) and methane (CH4),25 as shown in Fig. 1(a). The chamber pressure and RF plasma power were maintained at 0.3 torr and 100 W, respectively. Ar-diluted SiH4 fluence was maintained at 150 sccm, and the fluence ratios for synthesizing the Si-rich, stoichiometric, and C-rich SixC1−x films were R = 70%, 90%, and 92%, respectively, where R = [CH4]/([CH4] + [SiH4]) × 100%, at a fixed substrate temperature of 500 °C. The thickness of the deposited SixC1−x films was measured by the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6700, JEOL). The deposition rates of the Si-rich, stoichiometric, and C-rich SixC1−x films were 28.43, 24.41, and 17.23 nm min−1, respectively. Fig. 1(b) clearly shows that the SixC1−x film on a quartz substrate is semitransparent with a relatively high transmittance. The C/Si composition ratios of these nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films were determined by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with an Mg Kα line radiation source at 1256.3 eV. Raman scattering analysis by using a 532 nm Nd:YAG laser was performed for observing the structural bonds and crystallization of SixC1−x films with different C/Si composition ratios. In addition, the room-temperature continuous-wave PL was performed by pumping the sample with the He–Cd laser at a wavelength and average power of 325 nm and 50 mW, respectively. The PL spectrum ranging from 300 to 900 nm was resolved using a monochromator (CVI DK240) in connection with a photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R928) and a digital multimeter (HP 34401A).

Femtosecond Z-scan measurement
Among the reported methods for analyzing nonlinear optical properties, such as self-phase modulation,26 degenerate four-wave-mixing,27 nonlinear interometry,28 nearly degenerate three-wave mixing,29 ellipse rotation,30 beam distortion,31 and Z-scan measurements,32 Z-scan measurement is widely used for analyzing the nonlinear refractive index and the absorption coefficient because of its high sensitivity and a simplified architecture. The nonlinear absorption coefficient and refractive index of SixC1−x films were simultaneously measured by using a Z-scan apparatus with a femtosecond Ti:sapphire-laser-based excitation source. Fig. 2 depicts the single-beam Z-scan configurations employed for open- and closed-aperture experiments. The femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser was operated at 800 nm (Mai Tai VF-TLS, Spectra-Physics) with a pulsewidth and repetition rate of 80 fs and 80 MHz, respectively. The beam was focused on a 20 μm spot by using a double-convex lens, and the samples were moved along the z-axis by using a motorized translational stage. The peak intensity of the Ti:sapphire laser at the focal point was 10.46 GW cm−2. The laser pulse train was modulated by using a mechanical chopper (SR830, Stanford) operating at 1 kHz. The laser beam was split into two beams by a beam splitter. One beam as a reference beam was collected by a photodetector for stability adjustment; another one was used as a pump beam to measure the nonlinear transmittance of the SixC1−x films. The beam intensity of the far-field transmitted light passing through the aperture was recorded by using a balanced photodetector (2307, New Focus). The laser beam waist at the focus plane of approximately 20 μm and the Rayleigh length of 0.15 cm satisfied the Z-scan analysis criteria. The open-aperture Z-scan collects all light transmitted through the sample, which enables the characterization of the intensity-dependent absorption accompanying the highest transmission when translating the sample through the focal point. By contrast, a closed-aperture Z-scan collects only the on-axis segment of the divergent and diffracted beam by using an aperture placed on the z-axis in the far-field.

Modeling and simulation
The nonlinear absorption coefficient of Si-rich SixC1−x films can be described as31,33,34 (1)where αnon, I0, Leff, and z0 are the nonlinear absorption coefficient of the SixC1−x film, the peak pumping intensity, the effective thickness of the SixC1−x film, and the Rayleigh length of the pump beam, respectively. When propagating the laser beam through a material with a thickness of L and an absorption coefficient of α, the transmitted light is absorbed within a propagated distance of Leff defined as31 (2)In addition, the normalized transmittance of the closed-aperture Z-scan trace can also be fitted by (3)where ΔΦ is the phase shift of the SixC1−x film. The bandgap energy dependent TPA coefficient is expressed by35 (4)where β denotes the TPA coefficient, ℏω the photon energy, P the Kane momentum parameter, f2 and f the numerical factors, n0 the linear refractive index, and Eg the bandgap energy. Numerically, Fig. 3 shows the term [Eg(2ℏω − Eg)3]1/2/(ℏω)5 in eqn (4) as a function of the bandgap energy (Eg) when the pumping wavelength of the light source is set at 800 nm (equivalent to a photon energy of about 1.55 eV). As a result, the value of [Eg(2ℏω − Eg)3]1/2/(ℏω)5 is monotonically decreased by increasing Eg from 1.55 eV to 3 eV, indicating that the TPA coefficient effectively reduces when enlarging the bandgap energy of a nonlinear material.

On the other hand, the nonlinear refractive index can be fitted by the theoretical transmittance function of closed/open-aperture Z-scan trace,31,33,34 (5)where n2 and k0 denote the nonlinear refractive index of the SixC1−x film and wave number, respectively. In principle, the nonlinear refractive index is defined as  (6)in which the third-order nonlinear susceptibility is described by36 (7)where e represents the electron charge, ε0 the vacuum permeability, ω0 the resonant frequency, χ(3) the third-order nonlinear susceptibility, m* the effective mass, and d the lattice constant of the centrosymmetric material. The third-order nonlinear susceptibility can be enhanced by shrinking the lattice constant and/or reducing the effective mass of the centrosymmetric materials. In addition, the nonlinear absorption coefficient can also be described as a function of the bandgap:37 (8)where k is a material-independent constant.
Results and discussions
Analysis of SixC1−x composition by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy

Fig. 4 presents the XPS spectra of nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films grown with different [CH4]/[CH4 + SiH4] fluence ratios. The C/Si composition ratio of these nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films increases from 0.51 to 1.83 when the [CH4]/[CH4 + SiH4] fluence ratio is increased from 0.7 to 0.92, corresponding to the molar fraction index x of the nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films decreasing from 0.66 to 0.35. Under the deposition at low temperatures and weak RF plasma, SiH4 molecules decompose more easily because of the lower dissociation energy of SiH4 molecules (75.6 kcal mol−1).38 At a high molecular density, each reactant molecule receives insufficient energy from the plasma; consequently, the decomposition rates of SiH4 and CH4 molecules are indistinguishable. The average dissociation energy on each reactant molecule further decreases when the total reactant fluence is increased by increasing the [CH4]/[CH4 + SiH4] fluence ratios, which further contributes to the degradation of the SiH4 decomposition rate. Therefore, nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films grown with high [CH4]/[CH4 + SiH4] fluence ratios exhibit a low number of excess Si atoms, eventually increasing the C/Si composition ratio. Upon varying the [CH4]/[CH4 + SiH4] fluence ratios, the decomposed Si or C atoms increase in the chamber to change the C/Si composition ratio of the nonstoichiometric SixC1−x film. Either excess Si or C atoms can affect the bonding conditions of the nonstoichiometric SixC1−x film because the excess atoms can form interstitials, vacancies, antisites, or clusters.39–44

In 2003, Gali's group used the density functional theory under local density approximation to simulate the C interstitials in 3C- and 4H-SiC.34 The C interstitials can easily combine with the C antisites to form the interstitial-antisite C clusters.39 The most stable configuration of the C interstitials in 3C-SiC and 4H-SiC is a dumbbell configuration due to the degenerate π-orbital of C–C bonds.39 Moreover, the metastable C clusters can be self-assembled from these C interstitials,40 which either dissociate into isolated mobile C interstitials and immobile C antisites or transform to the stable triangle or ring structures after annealing.40 By using the ab initio supercell calculations, Mattausch et al. studied that the vacancy-interstitial recombination occurs due to the fast diffusion of C and Sii4+ interstitials.41 In addition, the C interstitials can be emitted from C clusters to combine with the survived vacancies at high temperature.41 On the other hand, some groups have also studied the behavior of Si clusters in SiC. Horons et al. simulated that the Si interstitials can form stable complexes with C interstitials, as the C interstitial exhibits fast diffusion velocity to form the Si–C interstitials.42 Therefore, the Si–C interstitial becomes more stable than the Si-interstitial cluster.42 Liao and co-workers simulated the stability, migration, and evolution of Si di-interstitials in the SiC by using the density functional theory,43 interpreting that the triangular Si di-interstitials is the most stable structure in the cubic SiC.43 Bockstedte et al. experimentally observed the vacancy aggregation in SiC under kinetic nitrogen deactivation,44 as the nitrogen recombines with the complexes of the Si vacancy.44 From aforementioned observations, the excess Si atoms can easily form the Si–C interstitials in the Si-rich SiC, whereas the excess C atoms may generate the interstitial–antisite C clusters in the C-rich SiC.
The Si-rich SixC1−x film exhibits excess Si atoms that form Si nanocluster precursors. These excess Si atoms self-assemble and form Si–Si bonds. By contrast, the excess C atoms in the C-rich SixC1−x films contribute to different C–C bonding architectures. The C–C bonds are either sp2-orbital bonds that form graphite-like structures or sp3-orbital bonds that form diamond-like structures. The different structures of SixC1−x can affect its optical nonlinearity.45 Furthermore, increasing the [CH4]/[CH4 + SiH4] fluence ratio from 70% to 92% reduces the O/Si composition ratio of nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films from 2.4% to 2.1%, thereby maintaining the quality of the PECVD-grown SixC1−x films because the redundant oxygen atoms easily bind with the Si or C atoms and degrade the optical nonlinearity of SixC1−x. Compared with nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films grown with different [CH4]/[CH4 + SiH4] fluence ratios (Fig. 5), the detected XPS spectra indicated a clear phase change of the SixC1−x films when the Si(2p)-orbital-electron-related XPS spectra were fit with four separated Gaussian components. The binding energies of the decomposed peaks are 99.7, 100.5, 101.5, and 103.35 eV, which are attributed to Si–Si, Si–C, C–Si–O, and O–Si–O bonds, respectively.46,47 As expected, the Si–Si-related spectral peak is substantially enhanced for nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films grown with a [CH4]/[CH4 + SiH4] fluence ratio reducing to 70%. Contrarily, the Si–C-related XPS signals are enhanced with increasing [CH4]/[CH4 + SiH4] fluence ratios because more carbon atoms separate from the CH4 molecules. That is, the Si–C bonds enhance for nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films with an increasing C/Si composition ratio. Moreover, the reduction of the O–Si–O- and C–Si–O-bond-related-XPS peak intensities reveals that the invaded oxygen content slightly decreases in nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films grown with high [CH4]/[CH4 + SiH4] fluence ratios. The reason for high oxygen content in synthesized samples is that the oxygen is employed to clean the PECVD chamber before the growth of the SixC1−x films. This process results in residual oxygen in the chamber wall and cannot be entirely removed even after several runs of deposition.
 Fig. 5  Si(2p)-related XPS spectra of Si-rich (upper), stoichiometric (middle), and C-rich (lower) SixC1−x films. 
The C-related compositional bonds in nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films were observed and analyzed by deconvoluting the C(1s)-orbital-electron-related XPS spectra, as shown in Fig. 6. In previous reports, Lee declared that the XPS peak of the sp2-orbital C–C bond locates at 284.3 eV.48 Yang et al. also reported that the sp3-orbital C–C bonds show a XPS peak at 285.4 eV,49 whereas the Si–C related XPS peak at 283.4 eV was observed by Santoni's group.50 In principle, the binding energy of the C(1s)-orbital-electron-related component should be fixed so as to compare the component intensity for different samples. As the XPS spectra contributed by sp2- and sp3-orbital C–C bonds appear at a higher binding energy, the peak of the C(1s)-orbital-electron-related XPS component spectrum will shift toward higher binding energy if the SixC1−x film exhibits higher C content. In our case, the peak of the C(1s)-orbital-electron-related XPS spectra is shifted from 283.4 eV to 283.65 eV when the SixC1−x is transferred from Si-rich to C-rich conditions.
 Fig. 6  C(1s)-related XPS spectra of Si-rich (upper), stoichiometric (middle), and C-rich (lower) SixC1−x films. 
Both the graphite- and diamond-like C–C-bond-related XPS peaks appear in nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films grown at a high [CH4]/[CH4 + SiH4] fluence ratio, indicating the coexistence of graphite- and diamond-like structures in nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films. However, the enhancement of graphite-like C–C bonds in C-rich SixC1−x films grown at a [CH4]/[CH4 + SiH4] fluence ratio of 92% is greater than that in diamond-like C–C bonds, because the diamond-like C–C bonds require higher temperatures to be formed in nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films. Notably, graphite-like C–C bonds contribute more to optical nonlinearity than diamond-like C–C bonds.51–53 In the C-rich SixC1−x film, the Si atoms prefer to bond with C atoms to form the Si–C bonds, whereas the excess C atoms easily form the amorphous interstitial–antisite C clusters with enriched C–C bonds with either sp2- or sp3-orbital bonding.47 At higher temperature, more C–C bonds transfer toward diamond-like sp3-orbital bonding.54 In addition, Morimoto's group fabricated the C-rich Si0.39C0.61 annealed from 600 °C to 1000 °C to observe the C–C bonds,55 revealing that the graphite-like sp3-orbital C–C bonds always exist in the C-rich Si0.39C0.61; however, the diamond-like sp3-orbital C–C bonds can hardly be observed.
To confirm the presence of the sp2- and sp3-orbital C–C bonds, Raman scattering analyses of SixC1−x films with different C/Si composition ratios were performed and the results are reported in Fig. 7. The relatively strong Raman scattering peaks at 795 and 970 cm−1 attributable to the transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) modes of the Si–C bonds are substantially enhanced by increasing the C/Si composition ratio.56 In addition, the purely crystalline Si-related Raman scattering peak at 520 cm−1 monotonically attenuates when the C/Si composition ratio is increased from 0.51 to 1.83, because more carbon atoms are incorporated into the SixC1−x film during CH4-rich growth. The C-rich SixC1−x films show additional Raman scattering peaks at 1330 and 1580 cm−1 because of the diamond-like and graphite-like C–C bonds, respectively.57,58 In fact, the Raman scattering peaks related to the D band of nanoscale disordered graphite is around 1350–1360 cm−1, which is close to 1330 cm−1.57,59 Ferrari and co-workers have reported the carbon D-band related Raman scattering peak at 1360 cm−1,57 and the disordered graphite related D band based Raman scattering peak at 1350 cm−1 was claimed.59 However, the observed Raman scattering peak at 1330 cm−1 is mainly attributed to the sp3-orbital related diamond-like C–C bonds,57 as confirmed from the XPS analysis that both sp3- and sp2-orbital C–C bonds co-exist in the sub-domain of the C-rich SixC1−x film. Therefore, the Raman scattering peak at 1330 cm−1 is mainly contributed by the sp3-orbital related diamond-like C–C bonds. Such carbon networks to which graphene, graphene oxide, and graphite contribute have been reported to possess stronger nonlinear optical properties compared to Si networks.51–53,60,61

Raman scattering is a supporting evidence to confirm the SixC1−x film when observing its related peaks at 795 and 970 cm−1 contributed by transverse and longitudinal optical modes of Si–C bonds. In addition, the Raman scattering signals exhibited below 400 cm−1 can only be observed from the hexagonal but not the cubic SiC structure.62 Previous studies also stated that the Raman scattering peaks at 266 cm−1 are attributed to the planar acoustic mode of 4H-SiC,63 and those located at 236 cm−1 and 241 cm−1 are contributed by the planar acoustic mode of 6H-SiC.64 That is, all of the SixC1−x films synthesized in this work form the 3C-SiC like phase structure which does not provide the Raman scattering peak below 400 cm−1, as shown in Fig. 8.

Femtosecond laser-based Z-scan analysis of the nonlinear optical properties of SixC1−x films
Open- and closed-aperture Z-scan traces of SixC1−x films with different C/Si composition ratios are presented in Fig. 9(a). The intensity-dependent absorption of the SixC1−x films was characterized by using open-aperture Z-scan analyses.31,33 The normalized transmittance of the open-aperture Z-scan trace of the Si-rich SixC1−x films gradually decreases with increasing peak pumping intensity, indicating that Si-rich SixC1−x films exhibit strong TPA. The optical transmittance and reflectance of the SixC1−x film were measured by using a UV-visible spectrometer (V670, JASCO) under low incident power and the linear absorption coefficient is obtained accordingly.
 Fig. 9  (a) Open-aperture and (b) closed-aperture Z-scan traces of Si-rich (upper), stoichiometric (middle), and C-rich (lower) SixC1−x films. The obtained curves from open- and closed-aperture Z-scan analyses are fitted by eqn (1) and (2), respectively. 
The PL peak wavelength is blue-shifted from 645 nm to 384 nm when transferring the SixC1−x from Si-rich to C-rich conditions, as shown in Fig. 10. After calibration the spectral curves with varying responsivity of the photomultiplier tube (PMT, Hamamatsu R928) at different peak wavelengths, the Si-rich SixC1−x film composed by Si–C and Si–Si bonds shows the lowest PL intensity among all samples (see blue curve in Fig. 10) as the enriched Si–Si bonds exhibit a smaller radiative recombination rate. The Si–C and Si–Si bonding structures contribute to different optical bandgaps, thus providing asymmetric spectra for the superimposed PL. For the stoichiometric SiC film (red curve in Fig. 10), the increasing C content forms more Si–C bonds than Si–Si bonds, which blue-shifts the PL peak to 600 nm. The Si–C bonds with a higher bandgap also exhibit a larger radiative recombination rate to result in stronger PL.65 As evidenced, the enhanced PL intensity of the SixC1−x film with tail-to-tail recombination was observed by increasing C content to enrich the sp2-orbital C–C bonds.66 However, the PL peak intensity of the C-rich SixC1−x film (see black curve in Fig. 10) is slightly decreased with the distorted spectrum due to the high-pass laser line filter in front of the monochromator, which inevitably induces a sharp cut at a wavelength below 350 nm to provide the C-rich SixC1−x film with an asymmetric PL spectral shape with decreased intensity.

When comparing SiC with the Si cluster, the 3C-SiC has a lower TPA coefficient because of its higher bandgap. Therefore, the TPA occurring in the nonstoichiometric SixC1−x film is dominated by Si clusters. When the carbon content in SixC1−x films is increased to achieve the C-rich conditions, the intensity-dependent absorption in the films changes from two-photon to saturable absorption because of the contribution of the excess C atoms. Carbon-based materials have been reported to exhibit saturable absorption,51 with either the buried diamond-like or the graphite-like C particles in the films contributing to saturable absorption.
Moreover, the optical nonlinearity of the nonstoichiometric SixC1−x film is contributed by saturated atomic absorption. To confirm if the saturable absorption properties exist in the SixC1−x films, the nonlinear transmittance analysis on the SixC1−x film as a function of intensity is performed. The excitation source is a focused Ti-sapphire laser with a central wavelength of 800 nm. The transmittance of the SixC1−x film is recorded by increasing the laser intensity, as shown in Fig. 11. No saturable absorption can be observed for the Si-rich SixC1−x and stoichiometric SiC films. Only the C-rich SixC1−x film exhibits saturable absorption due to the presence of sp2-orbital C–C bonds. By fitting with the equation of T = exp{−αlin − [αnon/(1 + Iin/Isat)]} (αlin: linear absorbance; αnon: nonlinear absorbance; Isat: saturation intensity), the obtained αlin, αnon and Isat are 0.227, 0.506 and 1.17 GW cm−2. Typical closed-aperture Z-scan traces of SixC1−x films grown with different C/Si composition ratios are presented in the right column of Fig. 9(b). In these traces, the effect of a nonlinear phase on normalized transmittance has nearly the same order of magnitude as that of intensity-dependent absorption on normalized transmittance.
 Fig. 11  Nonlinear transmittance of the Si-rich (left), stoichiometric (middle), and C-rich (right) SixC1−x film. 
To rule out intensity-dependent absorption, the close/open Z-scan traces were obtained by dividing the closed aperture traces by the open-aperture traces, as shown in Fig. 12. The open-aperture Z-scan trace is mainly attributed to the nonlinear absorption effect, whereas the closed-aperture Z-scan trace reveals more completed trace than others. The fitting parameters for the closed-aperture Z-scan trace are somewhat deviated as it combines the effects of nonlinear absorption and the nonlinear refractive index. Therefore, the closed/open Z-scan trace is obtained to solely observe the change in the nonlinear refractive index. As a result, both nonlinear absorption and nonlinear refractive index of the non-stoichiometric SixC1−x films can be individually obtained from open-aperture and closed/open-aperture Z-scan traces, respectively. During the experiment, the error bar is added in each trace to show the intensity fluctuation of pumped laser, which inevitably contributes to the fitting error, and all the fitting parameters are summarized in Table 1. By using the numerical simulation, the nonlinear refractive index of SixC1−x films was found to vary from 8 ± 1 × 10−12 to 1 ± 0.1 × 10−11 cm2 W−1 when SixC1−x films were detuned from the Si- to C-rich conditions, clearly elucidating that excess C effectively enhances nonlinear optical properties in nonstoichiometric SixC1−x relative to excess Si.

To realize sp2-orbital C–C bonds and clarify their role in detuning the optical nonlinearity of SixC1−x films, the nonlinear refractive index of SixC1−x films is plotted as a function of the C/Si composition of the films, increasing from 0.51 to 1.83, in Fig. 13. In Si-rich SixC1−x films, excess Si atoms replace C atoms to form more Si–Si bonds. These Si–Si bonds provide a higher lattice constant (5.431 Å) and a larger effective mass (0.36m0) and degrade third-order nonlinear susceptibility. Typically, the Si matrix with dense Si–Si bonds in Si-rich SixC1−x films possesses a high linear refractive index but a low nonlinear refractive index. Conversely, C–C bonds in C-rich SixC1−x films considerably alter the lattice constant and effective mass, thereby varying the nonlinear refractive index. A host matrix with diamond-like C–C bonds has a larger lattice constant (4.5396 Å) and effective mass (0.57m0) than those of a host matrix with Si–C bonds. Hence, the more diamond-like C–C bonds present in a C-rich SixC1−x film, the lower the nonlinear refractive index of the C-rich SixC1−x. Contrarily, graphite-like C–C bonds substantially shrink the lattice constant (2.46 Å) and reduce the effective mass (0.04–0.06m0) of the host matrix, effectively enhancing the nonlinear refractive index of C-rich SixC1−x films. If these graphite-like C–C bonds transform into graphene-like bonds, the effective carrier mass of the matrix can be reduced to zero to further enhance the nonlinear refractive index. In this study, graphite-like C–C bonds dominate in C-rich SixC1−x films, as confirmed by the XPS and Raman analyses. This elucidates why C-rich SixC1−x films with enriched graphite-like C–C bonds have a higher nonlinear refractive index compared with Si-rich and stoichiometric SixC1−x films.

In addition, the third-order nonlinear susceptibility originates from Miller's rule, as shown in eqn (7). The definition of “d” denotes the lattice constant as quoted from ref. 36. Moreover, other previous studies also derived the nonlinear susceptibility by denoting “d” as the lattice constant.67,68 In these cases, probably the samples are not at thermodynamic equilibrium. From the XPS analysis, the Si-rich SixC1−x has excess Si content of up to 0.97, whereas the excess C content of 0.83 exists in the C-rich SixC1−x film. These excess atoms (Si or C) could possibly self-aggregate to form clusters or interstitial–antisites in the nonstoichiometric SixC1−x matrix. Therefore, the excess Si atoms not only form the Si antisites by replacing C atoms but also generate the interstitials within the matrix of Si-rich SixC1−x. A similar phenomenon also occurs for the excess C atoms within the C-rich SixC1−x matrix. Although the antisite formation is easier than the interstitial generation in the nonstoichiometric SixC1−x when comparing their formation energy, both mechanisms result in Si–Si (or C–C) bonds and Si (or C) clusters to affect the optical nonlinearity, respectively. The Si–Si bonds in both Si interstitials and Si antisites are shorter than those in bulk silicon. From TEM images in Fig. 14, the antisite or interstitial clusters cannot be obviously discovered in all the samples.

As Si clusters in Si-rich SiC and C clusters in C-rich SiC are not dense and large enough to provide a nonlinear optical response like the one of their bulk counterparts, the Si–Si or C–C bonds in the scrappy grains of the non-stoichiometric SixC1−x film would dominate the optical nonlinearity of the films. Even with HRTEM analysis, the antisite or interstitial clusters cannot be obviously discovered in all samples. The TEM images reveal that the phases of all SiC samples are nearly amorphous; however, some blurred diffraction rings can be observed from the SAD analysis for the stoichiometric and C-rich SixC1−x samples. From the SAD patterns, the phase structure of the Si-rich SixC1−x film is almost amorphous without a diffraction ring. In contrast, at least two SAD diffraction rings can be observed to show that the stoichiometric SiC and C-rich SixC1−x may possess nano-cluster structures with small grains. The stoichiometric SiC has d-spacings of 0.307 nm and 0.226 nm contributed by (110)-oriented 3C-SiC with d = 0.311 nm and (200)-oriented 3C-SiC with d = 0.227 nm, respectively. This result has also been confirmed by observing the PL peaks near 517 nm due to the bandgap of 3C-SiC at 2.45 eV. Moreover, the d-spacings of 0.373 and 0.222 nm for the C-rich SixC1−x are attributed to the (004)-oriented 6H-SiC with d = 0.377 nm and the (102)-oriented 4H-SiC with d = 0.235 nm, respectively. This result indicates that both 6H- and 4H-SiC phases may currently exist in the C-rich SixC1−x to increase its bandgap and blue-shift its PL wavelength. In these SixC1−x samples with an almost amorphous structure, the bonding length is employed instead of the lattice constant to evaluate the optical nonlinearity contributed by these bonds. In general, the bonding lengths of the sp2- and sp3-orbital C–C bonds are 1.4 Å and 1.5 Å, respectively. The bonding length of the Si–C bond (Å) is larger than those of the C–C bonds. But the Si–Si bond in bulk Si exhibits the largest bonding length of up to 2.35 Å. This somewhat explains why the Si-rich SixC1−x obtains the smallest nonlinear refractive index. To confirm, the decomposition analysis on C(1s) related XPS spectra is also employed for the deconvolution of the sp2- and sp3-orbital C–C bonds. The XPS analyses reveal that different orbital bonds form specific peaks with the corresponding distributions as neighbor atoms contribute to different formation energies. Hence, the decomposed peaks of the sp2- and sp3-orbital related C–C bonds are respectively integrated to evaluate the relative ratio between sp2- and sp3-orbital C–C bonds. In the C-rich SixC1−x film, the ratio of the sp2- to sp3-orbital related C–C bonds is evaluated as 2.6 by using the C(1s) related XPS spectra, which confirms the dominated contribution of the sp2-orbital related C–C bonds to the optical nonlinearity due to the degenerate π-orbital electrons.
The structures of the SixC1−x films with different C/Si composition ratios are amorphous from the HRTEM analysis. Even though the weak diffraction rings are observed in the SAD patterns, it only declares the presence of nanocrystals but not the large-area crystalline structure existing in the sub-domain of the SixC1−x films. To confirm, the XRD analysis is also performed without any evidence on the crystallization of the SixC1−x, indicating that the macroscopic phase structures of all SixC1−x samples are amorphous, as shown in Fig. 15. As a result, the XRD and HRTEM analyses conclude that the structures of the SixC1−x films with different C/Si composition ratios are amorphous. The crystalline properties of the SixC1−x film cannot be proved by using only Raman and PL analyses, as the Raman analysis mainly observes the bond vibration in the SixC1−x film no matter whether its structure is crystalline or amorphous, and even the amorphous SixC1−x can also generate a PL signal due to its band-to-band radiative recombination mechanism. After taking all the analytical results into consideration, the structural phase of the nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films with different C/Si composition ratios is still amorphous, as mainly confirmed by using TEM and XRD analyses.

Fig. 16 and 17 show the absorption spectra and their corresponding Tauc' plots for three SixC1−x samples with different C/Si composition ratios. The optical bandgap of these SixC1−x samples is evaluated by using (αhν)0.5 = B(hν − Eopt) with α denoting the absorption coefficient of the nonstoichiometric SixC1−x film, h the Planck's constant, ν the frequency, and Eopt the optical bandgap of the nonstoichiometric SixC1−x film.69,70 For indirect bandgap materials, the phonon assisted process contributes to the absorption spectrum with two intercept points standing for EP1 = Eopt + Ephonon and EP2 = Eopt − Ephonon at the photon energy axis, and the optical bandgap can be obtained as Eopt = (EP1 + EP2)/2. As expected, the nonstoichiometric SixC1−x film increases its optical bandgap energy from 1.81 eV to 2.5 eV when varying the film composition from Si-rich to C-rich conditions. In Fig. 10, the PL peak wavelength of the stoichiometric SiC locates at 590 nm, which corresponds to the optical bandgap energy of 2.1 eV obtained from Tauc' plot shown in Fig. 17. With the more C atoms in the nonstoichiometric SixC1−x film, the excess C content in the C-rich SixC1−x film can self-aggregate to the graphite- and diamond-like C–C particles. The graphite-like C–C particles offer the lower bandgap in the SixC1−x film.71 However, the diamond-like C–C particles provide the higher bandgap71 even though the less diamond-like C–C particles exist in the SixC1−x film. The optical bandgap of the nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films can be obtained with the Tauc' plot, which reveals the macroscopic result but the related contribution from different compositions cannot be analyzed in detail.

If there are dense point defects such as the C interstitials and Si vacancies, they can also affect the bandgap of SixC1−x by modifying its absorption bandage tail with the defect related electronic energy levels located inside the forbidden region. However, the concentrations of these point defects cannot be confirmed due to the lack of analytical facility at the current stage. Therefore, only the macroscopic analysis by Tauc' equation on the optical bandgap energy can be obtained. The analysis from Tauc' plot only confirms that the C-rich SixC1−x film has the larger bandgap than the stoichiometric SixC1−x film because of the existence of the diamond-like C–C particles in the C-rich SixC1−x film. Therefore, C-rich SixC1−x films with a high bandgap usually have a low nonlinear absorption coefficient. However, the graphite-like C–C bonds embedded in C-rich SixC1−x films with dense nanoscale carbon clusters induce strong saturable absorption.41 In principle, graphite-like (sp2) C–C bonds contain delocalized π-electrons, which enhance saturable absorbance. When the C–C bonds transform from the sp2- to sp3-structure, the suppressed delocalized π-electrons degrade saturable absorption. Therefore, dense graphite-like C–C bonds in SixC1−x films are dominant factors in enhancing both nonlinear refractive indices and saturable absorption coefficients.
Conclusion
The nonlinear refractive indices and absorption coefficients of nonstoichiometric SixC1−x films grown through low-temperature PECVD at C/Si composition ratios varying from 0.51 to 1.83 are demonstrated. When the [CH4]/[CH4 + SiH4] fluence ratio is increased from 70% to 92%, the C/Si composition ratio of the SixC1−x films increases from 0.51 to 1.83. The Raman scattering signals at 795 and 970 cm−1 contributed by the TO and LO modes of the Si–C bonds are simultaneously enhanced at higher C/Si composition ratios. In addition, the Si-related Raman scattering signal at 520 cm−1 decreases when the C/Si composition ratio is increased from 0.51 to 1.83 because more carbon atoms are incorporated into the SixC1−x film under the CH4-rich conditions. C-rich SixC1−x films exhibit Raman scattering peaks at 1330 and 1580 cm−1 attributable to sp3- and sp2-orbital C–C bonds, indicating the coexistence of diamond- and graphite-like C networks. The nonlinear refractive index of the SixC1−x film increases from 8 ± 1 × 10−12 to 1 ± 0.1 × 10−11 cm2 W−1 when the C/Si composition ratio is increased from 0.51 to 1.83, because the increased C/Si composition ratio induces bonding structure variation in the SixC1−x. In addition, the increased C/Si composition ratio also affects its lattice constant and effective mass of nonstoichiometric SixC1−x. The nonlinear refractive index of SixC1−x films increases with a decreasing lattice constant and effective mass. The graphite-like C–C bonds are more dominant than diamond-like (sp3-orbital) C–C bonds in enhancing the nonlinear refractive index of SixC1−x films. The nonlinear absorption coefficient of SixC1−x films changes sign from positive to negative by converting the SixC1−x from the Si- to C-rich conditions, indicating that the absorbing mechanism has converted from two-photon to nonlinear saturable absorption. However, graphite-like C–C bonds have enriched delocalized π-electrons, which enhance saturable absorbance. Therefore, a high nonlinear refractive index and a saturable absorption coefficient can be obtained by enriching the graphite-like (sp2-orbital) C–C bonds in C-rich SixC1−x films. These observations confirm that C-rich SixC1−x films are more appropriate for fabricating waveguides and saturable absorbers than other candidates.
