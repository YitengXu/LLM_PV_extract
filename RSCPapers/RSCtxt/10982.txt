    , Accepted 25th March 2018First published on 26th March 2018AbstractCompositionally related cesium lead halide materials, such as CsPb2X5, have attracted great interest due to their considerable optoelectronic/optical properties as well as improved stability. Currently, CsPb2Br5 nanocrystals can be well-designed by tuning the ligands or precursor ratio, whereas, CsPb2X5 (with Cl− or I−) nanocrystals can only be obtained by the anion exchange method. Herein, we report a method to directly synthesize CsPb2X5 facilitated by thiol ligands. The morphology of CsPb2X5 can be designed as a nanowire. Importantly, the stability of directly synthesized CsPb2X5 nanowires is much improved when compared with the stabilities of the materials obtained by the anion-exchange method. We believe that this method will promote the application of 1D tetragonal CsPb2X5 in optoelectronics, optics and other fields.
Introduction
Cesium lead halide perovskite materials have attracted intense interest in recent years due to their unique physical and chemical properties.1,2 Their properties, such as large light absorption coefficients, long electron hole diffusion lengths, and tunable band gaps, make them suitable for use in high-performance solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and photodetectors.1–6 To date, the power conversion efficiencies of perovskite-type solar cells can be up to 22.1%,7 and perovskite quantum dots show desirable optical properties including widely tunable absorptions and emissions in visible ranges, narrow emission line widths, and high photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiencies.4,8–10
Since lead halide perovskite materials have been used in high-performance solar cells, research on lead halide perovskite has entered a new stage and has achieved great success.4,6,11,12 The studies on their chemical components and crystalline structures have improved their optoelectronic/optical properties, and new records of their performance have been noted. It should be noted that most of these studies are focused on the orthorhombic/cubic perovskite materials such as AMX3 (typically A = Rb+, Cs+, FA+, CH3NH3+ (MA), HC(NH2)2+ (FA); M = Ge2+, Sn2+, Pb2+; X = F−, Cl−, Br−, I−, or combinations thereof).3,4,13–17 However, the application of these perovskite materials (AMX3) are limited due to their instability in moisture, UV light, temperature and oxygen in the natural environment.18–22 Thus, finding a suitable surface treatment and coating for AMX3 or searching for a stable lead halide perovskite or compositionally related materials is an urgent issue of frontier research.23–25 Currently, many studies related to compositionally related materials (tetragonal CsPb2Br526–33 and hexagonal-phased Cs4PbBr634–38) showed the considerable optoelectronic/optical properties as well as improved stabilities of such materials. Yu and co-workers26 synthesized compositionally related CsPb2Br5 nanoplatelets with 87% photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) and used gradual anion exchange to achieve tunable PL emission for CsPb2X5. Zhou and co-workers27 used both experiment and theory to confirm that the band gap of CsPb2Br5 microplates was 2.44 eV. Sun and co-workers29 developed a dual-phase all-inorganic composite CsPbBr3–CsPb2Br5 and applied it as the emitting layer in LEDs; this device exhibited enhanced performance (a maximum luminance of 3853 cd m−2) and external quantum efficiency (2.21%). Deng and co-workers30 reported a new chemical strategy to control the morphologies of perovskite-related CsPb2Br5 nanocrystals with much improved stability. Therefore, a novel method to directly synthesize compositionally related CsPb2Br5 is quite important for its fundamental studies and further applications.
Herein, we reported a facile room-temperature method to directly synthesize 1D tetragonal CsPb2X5 (X = Cl, Br, I) nanowires with tunable fluorescence peaks in the visible spectrum (Scheme 1). The thiol ligand as an acid could strongly adsorb on the Pb2+ site of perovskites to improve their stability. According to the mechanism to synthesize perovskite nanowires in the condition of excess alkyl-amines, tetragonal CsPb2X5 nanowires could be obtained by tuning the ratio of thiol and amine ligands.30 The differences and significance of the current study in comparison to those of the previous reports are as follows: (i) this study first reported a method to directly synthesize stable and color-tunable compositionally related CsPb2ClXBr5−X and CsPb2IXBr5−X nanocrystals. By changing the ratio of chlorine (Cl) to bromine (Br) or iodine(I) to Br, the fluorescence peak position could be rationally tuned in the visible region. Previously, the color tunable compositionally related CsPb2ClXBr5−X and CsPb2IXBr5−X nanocrystals could be only obtained by the anion exchange method, and it was difficult to realize the direct synthesis of CsPb2X5 (X = Cl, Br, or I) nanocrystals.26 (ii) This is the first study to directly synthesize CsPb2ClXBr5−X and CsPb2IXBr5−X nanowires. As far as we know, the prior method could only synthesize CsPb2Br5 nanowires, and it was quite challenging to control the morphology of the nanowire for CsPb2X5 (X = Cl, Br, or I). Benefitting from the thiol ligands, the crystal phase of compositionally related tetragonal CsPb2X5 could be stabilized, and the morphology of nanowires (NWs) could be maintained.30 (iii) Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the stabilities of CsPb2ClXBr5−X and CsPb2IXBr5−X nanowires synthesized by ligand mediation were more improved than those of the nanowires synthesized by the anion exchange method; the latter conclusion was obtained due to the lack of a method to directly synthesize CsPb2ClXBr5−X and CsPb2IXBr5−X nanowires. This new method to directly synthesize stable tetragonal CsPb2X5 will lay a solid foundation for the applications of 1D tetragonal CsPb2X5 in optoelectronics, optics and other fields.

Results and discussion
1D tetragonal CsPb2X5 NWs with tunable PL emission spectra were directly synthesized by a recrystallization strategy at room temperature. The details of the synthesis can be found in Materials and Methods. Due to the employment of a suitable ratio of alkyl–amines and alkyl–thiols, the morphology of tetragonal CsPb2X5 could be maintained, even after changing the halide ions. As shown in Fig. 1A, by changing the ratio of Cl/Br, uniform tetragonal CsPb2ClXBr5−X NWs were successfully synthesized. In the case of Cl/Br = 0, 1D tetragonal CsPb2X5 NWs (1.2 μm × 40 nm × 40 nm, Fig. 1B) could be obtained.30 Furthermore, uniform perovskite CsPb2IXBr5−X NWs (Fig. 1C) could be obtained by tuning the ratio of I/Br. When compared with the widths and lengths of CsPb2Br5 NWs,30 the widths of CsPb2X5 NWs became much larger, and the lengths of CsPb2X5 NWs became much longer upon the introduction of Cl− or I−. These results may be related to the reactivities of different halogen anions. According to the affinity between amine and halogen (amine–I > amine–Br > amine–Cl), the reaction speed gradually decreased after changing the halogen from Cl− to I−, which led to much wider and longer nanowires. This conclusion can be demonstrated by Fig. 1A (minor products are thin and short nanowires) and 1C (thick and long nanowires). If the doping amount of Cl− was too high, the ripening process led to morphology changes, and the main products were thick and short nanowires. As shown in Fig. 1D–F, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns displayed the single crystalline structures of CsPb2ClXBr5−X, CsPb2Br5 and CsPb2IXBr5−X NWs. The diffraction spots could be assigned to the {110} and {200} crystal planes projecting along the [001] direction of tetragonal CsPb2X5. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of CsPb2ClXBr5−X, CsPb2Br5 and CsPb2IXBr5−X NWs (Fig. 1G–I) demonstrated their crystal lattices. The lattice spacings were 0.39 nm (CsPb2(Cl0.7/Br0.3)5), 0.42 nm (CsPb2Br5) and 0.43 nm (CsPb2(I0.7/Br0.3)5) corresponding to the {200} crystal planes. The statistical distribution histograms for CsPb2(Cl0.7/Br0.3)5 and CsPb2(I0.7/Br0.3)5 nanowires were based on the SEM images shown in Fig. 1J and M, respectively. The lengths of CsPb2(Cl0.7/Br0.3)5 and CsPb2(I0.7/Br0.3)5 nanowires were 1.2 μm and 1.9 μm, respectively, whereas their widths were 227 nm and 127 nm, respectively (Fig. 1J–O).

To identify the phases of CsPb2ClXBr5−X, CsPb2Br5 and CsPb2IXBr5−X NWs, we used the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method to measure these samples. As shown in Fig. 2A (blue curve) and Fig. S1,† the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 11.6, 23.2, 24, 29.3, 37.9, and 47.7 corresponded to {002}, {210}, {202}, {213}, {313}, and {413} planes of tetragonal CsPb2Br5. These results matched with the standard PXRD patterns of CsPb2Br5 (PDF# 25-0211, Fig. S1†).26–30 Upon increasing the Cl/Br ratio, the 2θ angles of {002} moved toward a higher angle (from 11.6 to 12.2, Fig. 2A; purple and green curves, Fig. 2B). Conversely, the 2θ angles of {002} moved toward a lower angle (from 11.6 to 9.8, Fig. 2A; red and black curves, Fig. 2B) after increasing the ratio of I/Br. These XRD results (Fig. 2A, Fig. S2, Table S1†) matched the results for the development of lattice spacings (Fig. 1G–I). By changing the ratio of Cl/Br or I/Br, the PL emission spectra of tetragonal CsPb2X5 NWs could be easily tuned from blue to red (Fig. 2C). The absorption peaks were 463 nm, 484 nm, 517 nm, 548 nm, and 604 nm, respectively (Fig. 2D), and the PL emission centers of these samples were 465 nm, 485 nm, 525 nm, 565 nm, and 621 nm, respectively (Fig. 2E). PLQYs of these samples ranged from 5% to 10%. It should be noted that the PL performance of tetragonal CsPb2X5 is still controversial. The observed PL for CsPb2X5 NWs may result from the samples themselves or defects or impurities or a combination of direct and indirect transitions.39,40 Furthermore, we used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to analyze the elemental ratio of Cs/Pb/X (Cl, Br, and I) (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The ratio of Cs/Pb/X (Cl, Br, and I) was about 1:2:5, which matched with that of tetragonal CsPb2X5. In addition, the atomic proportion of Cl/Br was 7/3 for CsPb2ClXBr5−X NWs with a PL emission at 465 nm (Table 1), and the atomic proportion of I/Br was 7/3 in CsPb2IXBr5−X NWs with a PL emission at 621 nm. Therefore, the XPS results further identified the crystal phase of these samples as tetragonal CsPb2X5. On the basis of the XPS, XRD and UV-Vis results, we found that the lattice parameters from the XRD diffraction peaks exhibited a linear response to the functions of the compositions of Cl or Br for CsPb2ClXBr5−X or CsPb2IXBr5−X, respectively (Fig. 4A and B). These results obeyed the Vegard's law, which implies that there is no phase transition or instability when the anion ratio of tetragonal CsPb2X5 is changed.41 Furthermore, the band gap energies (Eg) of CsPb2X5 were related to the ratios of their anion components, and their bowing parameters were −0.5 eV and 0.5 eV for CsPb2ClXBr5−X and CsPb2IXBr5−X, respectively (Fig. 4C and D).41–43

It should be noted that the anion-exchange method is a common way to synthesize lead halide perovskite or compositionally related materials for tuning their optical properties.10,44,45 Generally, anion-exchange reactions use halide precursors to mix with perovskite or compositionally related materials to achieve the anion exchange.24 After the anion-exchange process, their morphologies and optical properties may be much poorer than those of the initial material. There is still a lack of results for the anion-exchange reactions of tetragonal CsPb2X5. Therefore, comparing the properties of the direct synthesis method and anion-exchange method to obtain tetragonal CsPb2X5 is worth studying. The anion-exchange reactions for tetragonal CsPb2X5 were achieved by adding zinc chloride (ZnCl2) or zinc iodide (ZnI2) as the corresponding sources of I− or Cl− in toluene. This anion-exchange process was completed quickly at room temperature. The composition of CsPb2X5 nanowires obtained by anion-exchange could be identified according to the relationship between Eg and anion components (Fig. 4C and D). The absorption peaks for anion-exchange nanowires are shown in Fig. S3,† and their Eg values were 2.67 eV, 2.56 eV, 2.36 eV, 2.19 eV, and 2.00 eV. The x values for CsPb2ClXBr5−X and CsPb2IXBr5−X (Table S2†) could be identified from Fig. 4C and D. The ratios of the halide ions for CsPb2X5 nanowires were Cl/Br = 7/3; Cl/Br = 3/7; Cl or I/Br = 0/1; I/Br = 2.2/7.8; and I/Br = 7/3. The crystal phases of the anion-exchanged samples were analyzed by XRD (Fig. 5A), indicating that the anion exchange process did not change the crystal structure features, and the 2θ angles of {002} moved toward a higher angle for Br− to Cl− or a lower angle for Br− to I−; these results matched well with the results of directly synthesized tetragonal CsPb2X5. As shown in Fig. 5B, when ZnCl2 was reacted with CsPb2Br5, the color of CsPb2X5 changed from green to cyan and finally to blue. When ZnI2 was reacted with CsPb2Br5, the color of CsPb2X5 changed from green to yellow and finally to red. The PL emission centers of these samples are 465 nm, 485 nm, 525 nm, 565 nm, and 621 nm (Fig. 5C). In addition, the nanostructures of the anion exchange samples were still maintained as nanowires.

From left to right, the PL emission maxima of the samples shown in panel B are 465 nm, 490 nm, 525 nm, 564 nm, and 621 nm, respectively. 
As shown in Fig. S4,† using the anion exchange process, CsPb2ClXBr5−X NWs (5.8 μm × 563 nm × 563 nm) and CsPb2IXBr5−X NWs (11 μm × 514 nm × 514 nm) have been successfully synthesized. It should be emphasized that there are many by-products (small particles) generated after the anion exchange process (Fig. S4†), and these also include tetragonal CsPb2X5 nanocrystals according to the XRD data (Fig. 5A). For one part, such small particles may have significantly improved the PL performance, which decreases FWHMs of the PL peaks. For another part, the generation of small particles from CsPb2X5 nanowires must generate some defects, which may imply that these nanocrystals obtained by anion-exchange may be unstable.
A quantitative measurement of the stabilities of the products obtained by direct synthesis and the anion-exchange method was performed in a humid environment (60% RH) at room temperature (25 °C); the PL intensities were used as the index to indicate their stabilities (Fig. 6). As compared to blue CsPb2X5 (465 nm), the PL intensity of directly synthesized CsPb2X5 increased to 108% after 30 min of continuous illumination (Fig. 6A), which may relate to the photoactivation process.25,30 However, the PL intensity of CsPb2X5 obtained by anion-exchange decreased to 40% after 30 min of continuous illumination (Fig. 6B and C, Table S3†). These results demonstrated the much improved stability of directly synthesized CsPb2ClXBr5−X NWs. As shown in Fig. 6D–F, red CsPb2IXBr5−X (621 nm) also showed similar results. The PL intensity of directly synthesized CsPb2IXBr5−X increased to 114% after 30 min of continuous illumination (Fig. 6D), which was in accordance with the photoactivation process, whereas the PL intensity of CsPb2IXBr5−X obtained by anion-exchange decreased to 29% after 30 min of continuous illumination (Fig. 6E and F, Table S3†). Therefore, these results demonstrated that directly synthesized CsPb2X5 was much stable in an environment of high humidity (60% RH) and continuous illumination.

Conclusions
In summary, we report a facile room-temperature method to directly synthesize stable tetragonal CsPb2X5 NWs. By changing the ratio of Cl/Br or I/Br, compositionally related CsPb2X5 NWs having a uniform morphology can be obtained, and their color can be tuned from blue to red. Furthermore, we observe that directly synthesized CsPb2(Cl0.7/Br0.3)5 and CsPb2(I0.7/Br0.3)5 NWs are more stable as compared to the materials obtained by the anion-exchange method. These results may offer more options for the applications of stable and color-tunable compositionally related perovskite materials.
Experiment
Chemicals
PbBr2 (Aladdin, 99.9%, Shanghai, China), CsBr (Aladdin, 99.9%, Shanghai, China), octanethiol (Aladdin, 99%, Shanghai, China), n-octylic acid (Aladdin, 98%, Shanghai, China), oleylamine (Aladdin, 99%, Shanghai, China), dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.9%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China), and toluene (99.9%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China) were purchased and used without further purification.
Synthesis of CsPb2X5 (X = Cl, Br or I) nanowire
In a typical synthesis of CsPb2IXBr5−X nanowire (I/Br = 7/3, Scheme 1), PbI2/PbBr2 = 7/3 (0.4 mmol) and CsI/CsBr = 7/3 (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (10 mL). Octanethiol (OCT, 0.4 mmol) and oleylamine (OLA, 0.6 mmol) (OCT/OLA = 1/1.5) were added to the CsI/CsBr DMF solution. Then, 0.5 mL of the PbI2/PbBr2 precursor solution was added into toluene (10 mL). The solution quickly turned into a milky white colloidal solution. Immediately, 0.5 mL of the CsI/CsBr precursor solution was added into the milky white colloidal solution, and a strong green emission was observed instantly. Other samples with different ratios of Cl or I/Br were synthesized by the same strategy.
Anion exchange reactions with CsPb2Br5 nanowire
The anion exchange reactions were performed in a 10 mL flask. CsPb2Br5 nanowires (2 mL) synthesized in octanethiol and oleylamine were used as the precursor. For I− anion exchange, ZnI2 (30 mg) was dissolved in toluene (10 mL) in a 15 mL flask as the anion source, and excess ZnI2 solution was added into the CsPb2Br5 nanowire solution to achieve anion-exchange. The Cl− anion exchange experiments were performed using a similar protocol. Anion exchange could be completed in a time period ranging from tens of seconds to a few minutes. After the reaction, the emission peaks of the solution were detected by a spectrofluorometer.
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope (USA) operating at 200 kV. The low-voltage high-resolution STEM investigation was carried out on a double aberration corrected TitanTM cubed G2 60-300 S/TEM equipped with Super-XTM technology. The available point resolution was about 0.1 nm at an operating voltage of 60 kV. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was conducted on a Bruker AXS D8 X-ray diffractometer (USA) equipped with monochromated Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an achromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV) and a double pass cylindrical mirror analyzer (ULVACPHI 5000 VersaProbe (Japan)). Ultraviolet and visible absorption (UV-vis) spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-3600 plus spectrophotometer under ambient conditions. The (PL) spectra of CPbBr3 and tetragonal CsPb2Br5 excited by 450 nm were obtained with the Horiba PTI QuantaMaster 400 steady-state fluorescence system (Japan) under ambient conditions. The electronic device measurements were conducted by a VSP Potentiostat (Bio-Logic Corp., France). The lifetimes of PL were detected by a homemade instrument with 375 nm picosecond lasers.
