    , Accepted 24th June 2020First published on 25th June 2020AbstractMetal nanoparticles associated with local surface plasmon (LSP) resonance, i.e. highly confined electric field and large scattering cross-sections (σ), have been widely used to enhance the light-harvesting of solar cells toward high optoelectronic performance. However, the metal nanoparticles embedded into the solar cells suffer from parasitic ohmic loss that subsequently causes the local temperature to rise, which, in turn, reduces the photoelectric conversion efficiency and stability of solar cells. Previous studies on plasmon-enhanced solar cells have rarely considered the negative effects of metal nanoparticles’ ohmic losses and temperature rise on solar cell performance optimization. Therefore, it is of great interest to alleviate the ohmic loss and temperature rise that are critical for high-performance solar cells. Herein, we propose a model to comprehensively study and optimize the performance of plasmon-enhanced perovskite solar cells (PSCs) from simultaneous optical-electrical-thermal aspects. First, the optical simulation results indicated that the geometric tuning of metal nanoparticles can make full use of the plasmonic effect and significantly improve PSCs’ light absorption. The analysis showed that the embedded nanoparticles with optimal geometry in PSC devices can significantly increase the optical absorption by 17% (41%) compared to non-optimal nanostructures (devices without nanoparticles). Then, we explored the influence of the temperature-dependent carrier mobility on PSC performance from the coupled electrical and thermal studies. Our results indicated that the optimization of the geometrical parameters of metal nanoparticles can minimize energy dissipation, thereby redusing the heat loss and then lowering the local cell temperature. Interestingly, PSCs’ electrical properties such as carrier transportation significantly improved. Consequently, the PSC performance improved with increment in the short-circuit current by 23% and the power conversion efficiency by 38%.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been recognized as promising photovoltaic devices owing to the advantages of direct bandgap,1,2 high and balanced carrier mobility,3,4 long electron–hole diffusion length,5–7 and low non-radiative rate.8 The above-mentioned excellent optical and electrical properties give rise to a significant increment in the certified power conversion efficiency up to 25% in single-junction PSCs.9 The absorption coefficient of metal-halide perovskite materials enables a large amount of light in the visible region to be absorbed when the perovskite thickness is larger than 500 nm. However, there are still lots of work that need to be done for the practical PSCs to approach the ultimate efficiency limit (31%) and attain long-term stability simultaneously.10–12 In previous works, optimization of the electron/hole transport layer13–15 and incorporation of nanostructures into perovskite materials have been proposed to improve the stability and efficiency.16–21
Previous studies on the use of the plasmonic effect of nanoparticles on PSCs mainly focused on optical and electrical aspects,22–25i.e. maximization of the light absorption and improvement of carrier collection. However, the thermal effects should be considered for the optimization of PSCs performance, particularly the energy dissipation and stability issues after the incorporation of the metal nanostructure.26,27 As we know, the thermal effects can increase the temperature and affect the electrical carrier transportation and collection in solar cells.28 Therefore, it is essential to study the optical, electrical and thermal properties of PSCs, particularly with the embedded metal nanoparticles. The investigation of thermal properties of PSCs with/without the incorporated nanoparticles, and the accompanied energy dissipation in term of ohmic heat loss, is highly desirable in performance optimization of PSCs and other types of solar cells.29,30
In this work, we examined the optimal geometry of the spheroidal metal nanostructure on light absorption. The light absorption of PSCs with optimized geometrical spheroidal nanoparticles revealed 17% (41%) enhancement compared to the device with non-optimal nanostructures (devices without nanoparticles). Regarding the raised local temperature due to the incorporation of the metal nanostructure, we further investigated the influence of temperature on carrier mobility, and the subsequent electrical properties of PSCs. With the established optical-thermal-electrical analysis of perovskite solar cells, we studied the geometrical optimization of the spheroidal nanostructure to not only promote the optical light absorption and electrical carrier collection but also reduce the local temperature rise and energy dissipation. Finally, we showed that the optimization of the optical, electrical and thermal properties of plasmon-enhanced PSCs resulted in the enhancement of PCE up to 38% compared to the device without nanoparticles. Our work is of great importance to guide the design of plasmon-enhanced solar cells and approach its ultimate efficiency.
Result and discussion
The finite-difference (FD) method is one of the most commonly used numerical approaches to solving Maxwell's equations31,32 due to its flexibility and easy implementation. In this work, the FD method was adopted to study the optical, electrical and thermal properties of perovskite solar cells. To investigate the light absorption properties, the absorbed power density (η) is written as follows: (1)where ΔSa is the area of perovskite, ω the angular frequency, ε0 the permittivity in vacuum, Im[ε(λ)] is imaginary part of the complex dielectric constant of the perovskite material, and E the electric field. The optical absorption of the perovskite material and the underlying mechanism of absorption enhancement in plasmon-enhanced PSCs can be studied and analyzed in the optical model. For studying the electrical characteristics of PSCs, the exciton generation rate G can be written as follows: (2)
Thereinto, nr and ki are the real and imaginary parts of the complex refractive index of the perovskite material, respectively. h is the Planck constant and Γ is the solar irradiance spectrum of AM 1.5G. The electrical performance of the solar cells was analyzed by solving the following semiconductor equations: (3) (4) (5)
In formulae (3)–(5), ε represents the static dielectric constant of the perovskite material, and n and p the concentration of electrons and holes, respectively. q is the unit charge, φ the potential, μn and μp the electron and hole mobility, Dn (Dp) is the electron and hole diffusion coefficient; the exciton generation rate G can be obtained using formula (2), and the exciton recombination rate is represented as R. We used radiative (bimolecular) recombination and non-radiative (Shockley-Read-Hall, SRH) recombination in our calculations (see details in ESI†). The detailed derivations of the formulae can be found in our previous works.33,34
We first studied the scattering cross-sections (σ) of the spheroidal nanostructures with various eccentricities, volumes and external dielectric environments. Fig. 1(a) shows the total σ of spherical nanoparticles (R = 30 nm, silver (Ag) and copper (Cu)) embedded into the dielectric material with refractive index n = 3 that approximates to the index of the perovskite material. The result indicated that the light scattering properties of the Ag nanoparticle are better than those of Cu nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†), we also found that Ag is more suitable for plasmon-enhanced PSCs than other common metal materials (e.g. Au, Cu and Al, etc.). The influence of the various surrounding dielectric materials (with refractive index n = 1.33, 1.9, 3, corresponds to water, organic and perovskite material) on the light scattering efficiency was further studied and is shown in Fig. 1(c). With the increment in the surrounding material refractive index, the scattering peak location of Ag sphere nanoparticles (R = 30 nm) is redshifted and the amplitude of the scattering intensity is enhanced. Therefore, the incorporation of Ag sphere nanoparticles into perovskite is much beneficial to light trapping for perovskite solar cells. In addition, we further study the geometry of the Ag nanoparticle by modulating its eccentricity. The eccentricity (denoted as e) of the spheroidal nanoparticle is defined as e2 = 1 − rz2/rx,y2, where rx,y are the lengths of the major axis and rz the minor axis. The spheroidal Ag nanoparticles with the eccentricity of e = 0 (rx,y = rz = 30 nm), e = 0.75 (rx,y = 45 nm, rz = 30 nm) and e = 0.89 (rx = ry = 65 nm, rz = 30 nm) have been studied. As shown in Fig. 1(b), besides the shift of scattering peaks, the additional high-order scattering peaks can be observed when the nanoparticle is embedded in high-index materials. The spheroid nanoparticle with the eccentricity e = 0.89 has the best scattering efficiency, which has been considered as the optimal geometry of nanoparticles for harvesting the incident light.

(c) σ of spherical Ag nanoparticles (e = 0, rx,y = rz = 30 nm). The surrounding dielectric materials have the refractive index n = 1.33, 1.9 and 3 that correspond to the index of water, organic and perovskite materials. 
With the obtained knowledge of the scattering efficiency for various geometrical nanoparticles, we further study the introduction of the spheroidal nanoparticles into PSCs, whose scattering effect improves light trapping and absorption of active materials. The device configuration of the PSC structure is shown in Fig. 2. The thickness of the ITO anode is 40 nm, the hole transport layer PEDOT:PSS 20 nm, the perovskite active layer 200 nm,35 the electron transfer layer ZnO 40 nm, and the cathode Ag 100 nm. The complex refractive indices of the perovskite material are adopted from the published data (see Fig. S1, ESI†).36

To further understand the influence of spheroidal nanoparticle eccentricity on PSC absorption, the FD method was adopted to examine the absorbed energy density that is promoted by the strengthened light–matter interaction in nanoparticle-incorporated PSCs. The absorbed energy density of PSCs embedded by various spheroidal nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 3, which unveils that the geometrical parameters of the nanoparticle, e.g. eccentricity and size, substantially modify the active layer absorption. Compared to the device without nanoparticles, the incorporated nanoparticle initially boosts the absorbed energy density upon increasing the spheroidal nanoparticle eccentricity from e = 0 (rx,y = rz = 30 nm sphere) to e = 0.89 (rx,y = 65 nm, rz = 30 nm). The incorporation of nanoparticles into PSCs induces a considerable interaction between light and the nanoparticle due to strong scattering as well as the local surface plasmon resonance (600–700 nm), subsequently improving the light absorption. Then we conducted an additional study, and the theoretical results showed that the employment of smaller or larger metal nanoparticles in PSCs suppresses the optical performance. The absorbed energy density of the active layer after embedding smaller (rx,y = rz = 20 nm sphere) and larger (rx,y = 75 nm, rz = 30 nm spheroid) Ag nanoparticles were calculated. As shown in Fig. S4(a) (ESI†), the results indicated that the absorbed energy density of the perovskite material reached the maximum value via embedding metal nanoparticles with the size rx,y = 65 nm, rz = 30 nm. This is because when the size of the sphere is too small, it cannot excite a strong localized plasmon. When the spherical size is too large, it causes more parasitic ohmic loss. Interestingly, the modulated light–matter interaction revealed a strong dependence on the nanoparticle eccentricity and size.

To better understand the underlying mechanism of absorption improvement for the PSCs with and without nanoparticles, we studied the electric field profile in perovskite materials, which is highly related to the subsequent electrical generation rate of free charge carriers. Fig. 4 shows the electric field distributions in perovskite at a wavelength of 650 nm. As shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), the results indicated that the incorporation of nanoparticles substantially enhances the electric field intensity due to the excitation of the localized plasmon resonance and scattering effect of the metal nanoparticles. By further optimizing the nanoparticle geometrical parameters, the highly localized electric field around the nanoparticles was observed as increasing the spheroidal eccentricity from e = 0 to 0.75 and then to 0.89 (Fig. 4(b)–(d)). The enhancement was attributed to the promotion of the scattering effect and the presence of the high-order localized plasmon resonances after the geometrical parameter optimization (see Fig. 1).

The eccentricity of the spheroidal nanoparticles are (b) e = 0 (rx,y = rz = 30 nm), (c) e = 0.75 (rx,y = 45 nm, rz = 30 nm) (d) e = 0.89 (rx,y = 65 nm, rz = 30 nm). The wavelength is 650 nm. 
The light-harvesting efficiency of perovskite materials has been promoted by the scattering effect and localized plasmon resonance of metal nanoparticles. However, the parasitic absorption of the incorporated metal nanoparticles, particularly for the one with large size, would then turn into ohmic loss in terms of heat, and raise the local temperature, which is critical to the photovoltaic performance and stability. The rise of the local temperature will also affect the electrical properties of the semiconductor perovskite materials, e.g. the bandgap, carrier mobility, capture cross-section of defects, etc. To the best of our knowledge, the parasitic absorption of metal nanoparticles and its accompanied influence on the photothermal properties of PSCs have rarely been studied. Herein, we examined the eccentricity and size of the metal nanoparticle on its parasitic absorption. The parasitic absorption of two different nanoparticles but with the same volume (i.e. e = 0, rx,y = rz = 39 nm and e = 0.75, rx,y = 45 nm, rz = 30 nm) was studied, which is shown in Fig. 5(a) Although the volume of two spheroidal nanoparticles was the same, the increase in the eccentricity of the Ag spheroidal nanoparticle from e = 0 to e = 0.75 decreased its parasitic absorption. The parasitic absorption of the metal nanoparticle further decreased with the increment in the nanoparticle eccentricity (i.e. from e = 0, 0.75 to 0.89). As shown in Fig. 5(b), the parasitic absorption was concentrated at 600–700 nm, which also better explains the physical mechanism of the enhanced absorbed energy density in Fig. 3. In other words, for the two nanoparticles with the same volume, the spheroidal one revealed a stronger scattering efficiency but less ohmic loss than the spherical one.

(a) Parasitic absorption of the spheroidal nanoparticles with the eccentricity e = 0 (rx,y = rz = 39 nm) and e = 0.75 (rx,y = 45 nm, rz = 30 nm). The volume of the two nanoparticle are the same. (b) Parasitic absorption of the nanoparticle with the eccentricity e = 0 (rx,y = rz = 30 nm), e = 0.75 (rx,y = 45 nm, rz = 30 nm) and e = 0.89 (rx,y = 65 nm, rz = 30 nm). 
As we know, the parasitic absorption of metal nanoparticles is ohmic loss and then turns into the heat to induce the rise in the local temperature. The rise in the local temperature affects the electrical properties of perovskite materials. The heat conduction equation29 was adopted to describe the local temperature rise for the metal nanoparticle and the perovskite material. Q = ∇(k0∇T)(6)
Thereinto, k0 is the thermal conductivity coefficient of the metal nanoparticle and perovskite, T the temperature and Q the optical absorption energy by the nanoparticle. After numerically solving the heat transfer equation by the FD scheme, the temperature distributions in the metal nanoparticle-embedded perovskite are shown in Fig. 6(a)–(d). The local temperature of the perovskite material was increased by 65 °C (from 300 K to 365 K) after the incorporation of the nanoparticle with the eccentricity e = 0 (rx,y = rz = 30 nm) (Fig. 6(a)). However, the increase in the spheroidal nanoparticle eccentricity substantially alleviates the local temperature rise due to the strong scattering effect and reduced parasitic absorption loss (Fig. 5).

(a–d) Temperature distribution and (e–h) carrier mobility distribution in perovskite with the spheroidal nanoparticle eccentricity of (a), (e) e = 0 (rx,y = rz = 30 nm), (b), (f) e = 0 (rx,y = rz = 39 nm), (c), (g) e = 0.75 (rx,y = 45 nm, rz = 30 nm) and (d), (h) e = 0.89 (rx,y = 65 nm, rz = 30 nm). 
The increment of temperature will alter the electrical properties of perovskite. For instance, the carrier mobility of perovskite is highly dependent on the temperature and can be expressed as follows:37 (7)where A is the area of perovskite, q is the electron charge, m* is the effective mass and Ni is the doping concentration. Under the case of the low doping concentration, the term  can be ignored. Therefore, the expression of carrier mobility can be simplified as follows: (8)
With the above relationship between the temperature and carrier mobility, we can get the spatially distributed carrier mobility. As shown in Fig. 6(e)–(h), the mobility decreases with the increase in temperature. The spatially distributed mobility will directly affect the velocity of the carrier to the electrode, and the reduction of mobility will increase the electron–hole recombination, consequently reducing the electrical performance of PSCs. Therefore, when plasmonic metal nanoparticles are adopted to optimize PSC optical absorption, we should also pay attention to the influence of the thermal heat generation of nanoparticles on the electrical parameters of perovskite.
The optical, thermal and electrical processes are individually studied for the perovskite material with various incorporated metal nanoparticles. We have further conducted studies of the coupled optical-electrical-thermal processes in perovskite solar cells. Based on the developed FD method in our previous work,22 the photovoltaic characteristics are obtained through simultaneously solving the Maxwell's, semiconductor and heat transfer equations. From Fig. 7, it is obvious that the short circuit current density (Jsc) continuously increases with the increase in nanoparticle eccentricity. The power conversion efficiency reaches the maximum value when the perovskite solar cell is incorporated with the spheroid nanoparticle with the eccentricity e = 0.89. However, as shown in Fig. S4(b) (ESI†), the theoretical results indicated that the employment of the smaller or larger metal nanoparticles in PSCs decreases the electrical performance. Therefore, by rationally designing the nanoparticle geometry, the optical, electrical and thermal loss can be further reduced, which results in the enhancement of photovoltaic performance.

Table 1 summarizes the detailed electrical characteristics of the PSCs with various geometrical nanoparticles. By optimizing the geometry of spheroidal Ag nanoparticles, the PSC performance can be maximized to 22.92% (with open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.11 V and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.88 mA cm−2) with the spheroid nanoparticle eccentricity e = 0.89. Compared to non-optimal nanostructures (devices without metal nanoparticles), the Jsc and PCE were improved by 12% (23%) and 26% (38%), respectively. Therefore, our proposed model demonstrated that the coupled model is important for plasmon-enhanced PSC performance optimization.

Conclusion
In summary, the optical-electrical-thermal processes have been comprehensively studied for PSC performance optimization. Our work provided an approach to study in-depth the loss mechanism of perovskite solar cells from the aspects of optical-electrical-thermal processes. First, we demonstrated that the optimization of the spheroidal nanoparticle geometrical parameters can further promote the perovskite light-harvesting efficiency due to the optimal scattering effect and localized plasmon resonance. Then, we systematically analyzed the parasitic absorption of spheroidal nanoparticles with different eccentricities, and the influence of temperature on the carrier mobility of perovskite. Finally, our proposed optical-electrical-thermal studies showed that the electrical performance of the PSC device can be further optimized compared to the device with non-optimal nanoparticles (devices without nanoparticles), the short-circuit current was increased by 12% (23%), and the PCE was increased by 26% (38%). The proposed optical-electrical-thermal model is also capable of handling other semiconductor materials, providing an approach to design and engineer the efficient photovoltaic devices.
