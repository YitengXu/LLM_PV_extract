    , Accepted 17th December 2019First published on 19th December 2019AbstractSubnaphthalocyanine triimides (SubNcTIs) as solution processable electron acceptors were designed and synthesized by introducing three electron-withdrawing imide groups to subnaphthalocyanines. Their solubility and crystallinity could be adjusted conveniently by substituents at imide terminals or boron atoms. Their absorption, electrochemistry, thermal properties, and applications as electron acceptors in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJOSCs) were investigated. SubNcTIs with strong absorption at 300–750 nm, maximum extinction coefficient of up to 16.8 × 104 M−1 cm−1, and deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels (−3.79 to −3.90 eV) are expected to be excellent electron acceptors. The four SubNcTIs exhibit good thermal stability, with 5% weight loss at a temperature higher than 350 °C. Blending with the donor polymer of PTQ10, BHJOSCs based on acceptor 9b gave the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.25%, which is the highest value among the solution processable cyanine family. Space-charge-limited current (SCLC), charge recombination, and charge collection ability measurements showed that PTQ10:9b devices have a high and balanced carrier mobility, less charge recombination, and better charge transport, which lead to high photovoltaic performance. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements revealed that relatively strong π–π stacking and large correlation lengths of PTQ10:9b films are favorable for charge transfer, which caused a high Jsc of corresponding solar cells. This study demonstrates that SubNcTIs as a promising chromophore could be used to construct potential electron acceptors.
Introduction
Organic semiconductors with advantages of being light weight, solution processable, and flexible have received great attention, because of their promising applications in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJOSCs), organic field-effect transistors, organic light-emitting diodes, etc.1–5 Compared with excellent and plentiful donor materials, high performance acceptors are scarce. Fullerene derivatives such as PC61BM and PC71BM have been the dominant electron acceptors for a long time. However, their weak absorption, difficult modification processes, and high cost limit their further applications.6–8 As alternatives to fullerenes, non-fullerene acceptors have been developed rapidly over the past 5 years.9,10 Rylene diimides and ITIC derivatives (such as FTTB-PDI4, N2200, and IT-4F, structures are in Fig. S1, ESI†) are two kinds of the most excellent electron acceptors, and many BHJOSCs based on them reach a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10%.11–13 To match with different donors, various non-fullerene acceptors with different structures are desired, since they are essential in high performance BHJOSCs with complementary absorption, matched energy levels, and suitable phase separation of acceptor–donor blends.14–16
Although phthalocyanines (Pcs) and naphthalocyanines (Ncs) with strong absorption and high stability have proved to be promising organic semiconductors,17,18 the planar conjugated core has a very strong tendency to aggregate into large domains which is unfavorable for the efficient charge transfer and phase separation in BHJOSCs.19 BHJOSCs with metallic Pcs as acceptors reached a highest PCE of only 1.09%,20 while solar cells based on Ncs have not been studied.
Subnaphthalocyanines (SubNcs, Fig. 1)21,22 and subphthalocyanines (SubPcs, Fig. S2, ESI†)23 with a three-dimensional (3D) structure have far superior molecular arrangement and charge transfer, since 3D conjugation decreases molecular aggregation effectively, such as special 3D structures of excellent fullerene or PDI acceptors.24 Three-layer heterojunction solar cells based on SubNcs have reached a PCE of 8.40%, however active materials were processed by complex vapor deposition.25 Unsubstituted SubNcs are unsuitable for solution processable acceptors because of the following limitations: (1) the high lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of −3.6 eV does not match with many excellent donors; (2) poor solubility makes processing and synthesis difficult; (3) polychlorinated SubNc as side products are impossible to remove.26,27 Developing SubNc acceptors without the above defects is significant for their applications in OSCs.
 Fig. 1  Structures of SubNcs, SubPcTIs, and SubNcTIs. 
Imide groups have been used to construct many excellent electron acceptors due to their strong electron accepting ability and high stability. Many perylene diimides and naphthalene diimide derivatives have become excellent acceptors in organic solar cells (OSCs).28–31 In our previous work, fusing imide groups with SubPcs led to subphthalocyanine triimides (SubPcTIs, Fig. 1) which showed a high PCE of 4.92% in solution-processed OSCs.32 However, SubPcTIs have bad stability, they decompose even when stored in the glovebox for two weeks, which seriously limits their future applications. In addition, SuPcTIs with a cut off wavelength of 650 nm could not harvest near infrared (NIR) light which takes up nearly half of the solar energy.33
Herein, subnaphthalocyanine triimides (SubNcTIs, Fig. 1) with different substituents at the boron (B) atoms and imide sites were designed and synthesized. Unlike SubPcTIs, SubNcTIs demonstrate excellent stability, and their cut off wavelength of absorption reaches 750 nm, red-shifting by 100 nm. In contrast to impure SubNcs, soluble SubNcTIs are easy to separate from polychlorinated side products. The PCE of BHJOSCs based on acceptor 9b is up to 6.25%, which is the highest among all the solution processed OSCs based on Pc, Nc, or SubNc derivatives. The side chains of organic semiconductors have a significant effect on their solubility, crystallinity, molecular packing, and charge transport.34 Substituents on the B or N atoms of SubNcTIs could be changed conveniently, through which their properties can be adjusted readily. Five different substituents of 1-pentylhexyl, 2,6-diisopropylphenyl, F, Cl, and phenoxyl attached to N or B atoms were used in this work.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
As shown in Scheme 1, SubNcTIs 9a, 9b, 10a, and 10b were synthesized from commercially available o-xylene (1) in 8 or 9 steps. 4,5-Dibromo-o-xylene (2), 1,2-dibromo-4,5-bis(dibromom-ethyl)benzene (3), 6,7-dibromo-2,3-dimethylnaphthalene-dicarb-oxylate (4), and 6,7-dibromo-2,3-naphthalic acid (5) were synthesized according to literature methods.35,36 6,7-Dibromo-2,3-naphthalic anhydride (6) was created by the dehydration of 5 at 220 °C in quantitative yield, which is superior to the previously reported method of reflux in acetic anhydrate.36 6,7-Dibromo-N-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-1,3-naphthalene monoimide (7a) and 6,7-dibromo-N-(1-pentylhexyl)-1,3-naphthalene monoimide (7b) were prepared by the reactions of 6 with appropriate amines. The reaction of 7a/7b with CuCN leads to 6,7-dicarbonitrile-N-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-1,3-naphthalene monoamide/6,7-dicarbonitril-N-(1-pentylhexyl)-1,3-naphthalene monoi-mide (8a/8b).

Compound 9a/9b was synthesized by the cyclization reaction of 8a/8b with BCl3, refluxing in the mixed solvent (p-xylene:mesitylene = 1:1, v:v) with a moderate yield. It is noteworthy that excess BCl3 and a high boiling point solvent are essential, otherwise a very low yield and more side products will appear. Compound 10a was obtained in 75% yield by the substitution reaction of 9b with AgBF4 at room temperature.37 Substitution of 9b with phenol in toluene afforded 10b.
All the new compounds 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9a, 9b, 10a, and 10b were characterized clearly using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS. The four SubNcTIs have excellent solubility in many solvents. Their solubility in chloroform or chlorobenzene is more than 25 mg mL−1, which guarantees their solution processing.
In contrast to the poor stability of SubPcTIs, SubNcTIs were stable under ambient conditions or in the silica gel column, which makes purification simple. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) curves indicate that the four SubNcTIs were thermally stable with a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of over 350 °C (Fig. 2). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of SubNcTIs (Fig. S3, ESI†) showed no obvious exotherm or endotherm peaks below 250 °C, meaning no phase transformation in the above temperature range.

Solution and film absorption of SubNcTIs are shown in Fig. 3. The optical parameters are summarized in Table 1. All SubNcTIs exhibit similar absorption profiles with strong solution absorption in the range of 300–700 nm, indicating the tiny influence of different substituents on the electronic structures of conjugated cores. Their highest maximum extinction coefficient (εmax) is up to 16.8 × 104 M−1 cm−1, which is two times higher than that of unsubstituted SubNc-Cl (Fig. S2 (ESI†), 7.94 × 104 M−1 cm−1),38 because bulky imide chains decrease the serious molecular aggregation of SubNc-Cl.39 Film absorption edges red-shift to about 34 nm compared with solution ones, indicating their strong intermolecular aggregation in the solid-state. These compounds with a cut off wavelength of 750 nm are potential NIR photosensitizers, since acceptors are responsible for absorbing near NIR light in the current high performance BHJOSCs.40

Emission spectra of these SubNcTIs in CHCl3 are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) and fluorescence lifetimes were 18.8–25.2% and 2.28–3.07 ns respectively (Fig. S5 ESI,† and Table 1), which is similar to those of unsubstituted SubNcs (Φf = 22%, τs = 2.5 ns).38 Therefore, introducing imide groups does not affect the strong emission of SubNcs, which makes soluble SubNcTIs promising fluorescent dyes.
Electrochemical properties of the four SubNcTIs were measured using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. The results are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) and Table 1. Their LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −3.79 to −3.90 eV, which is 0.19–0.30 eV lower than that of SubNcs (−3.60 eV),21 reflecting the strong electron-withdrawing properties of imide groups. The suitable energy levels make these acceptors matchable with most of the excellent electron donors in organic photovoltaics.
To fully understand their geometries and optical properties, theoretical calculations of these molecules were studied with a PBEPBE/6-311g(d,p) basis set in Gaussian 09 programs.41 Since they have little effect on the conjugation of chromophores, alkyl chains were omitted from the calculations.42,43 As shown in Table 1 and Fig. S7a (ESI†), their theoretical λmax and band gaps are close to the experimental results, with a λmax difference less than 10 nm and an Eg difference of about 0.3 eV. The four compounds have similar experimental λmax and Eg; their experimental λmax difference is within 6 nm and their Eg difference is only 0.01 eV, and their calculated results (10 nm difference in λmax, 0.01 eV difference in Eg) agree very well with the above experimental ones. Well matched theoretical and experimental results indicate a reliable simulation method. Geometries and frontier orbitals of these compounds are shown in Fig. S7b and Table S5 (ESI†). It is found that they have a symmetrical 3D structure, and the angle between the central B–Cl/F/O bond and the naphthalene core is around 114° (Fig. 1). Rigid 3D structures are beneficial to the molecular packing and electron transporting in BHJOSCs.44
Photovoltaic properties
To investigate photovoltaic applications of SubNcTI acceptors, solar cells with inverted configurations of ITO (indium tin oxide)/ZnO/donor:acceptor/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. PTB7-Th, PBDB-T, PDCBT, PTQ10 and J52 were selected as donor materials, because they have matched energy levels and complementary absorption with SubNcTIs.45–49 The structure, absorption, and energy levels of these donors are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The device performance indicated that PTQ10 was the best donor for these acceptors (Fig. S9a and Table S1, ESI†).
To obtain high performance PTQ10:SubPcTI solar cells, the donor:acceptor weight ratios, solvent additives, and film thicknesses were carefully optimized. The key device parameters and all detailed photovoltaic data are summarized in Tables S2–S4 and Fig. S9b–d (ESI†). Solvent additives 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), and 1,2-diphenoxyethane (DPE) were used to optimize the morphology of the active layer.50 The optimal condition is PTQ10:9b (1:1) in a total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 with 0.5 vol% DIO and 0.5 vol% DPE, and the active layer is about 90 nm in thickness.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 4, and corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. It is shown that additives can effectively improve the performance of solar cells. Furthermore, the devices based on PTQ10:9b reached a highest PCE of 6.25%.

The EQE spectra of the OSCs are displayed in Fig. 4b. A photo response in the broad range of 300–750 nm was observed, which is contributed by both the donor and acceptor. Since absorption of PTQ10 is within 300–680 nm, acceptor SubPcTIs contribute greatly to the photocurrent in the NIR range. PTQ10:9b shows a spectral peak at 609 nm with a highest EQE of 74%, the EQE of 9b is higher than that of other acceptors in the whole absorption range, which is consistent with its highest Jsc.
The electron/hole mobilities of pure acceptors and PTQ10:SubNcTI blends were measured using the SCLC method with electron/hole-only devices (see the Fig. S10 (ESI†) and Table 3). The electron mobilities (μe) of acceptor films were around 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. The μe of the PTQ10:9b blend film is 1.33 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is two times higher than that of the blend films of the other three acceptors. The μh/μe value of the blend film based on PTQ10:9b (μh/μe = 365) is much smaller than that of the blend films of other acceptors (μh/μe within 963–2138). The relatively high and balanced carrier mobility of PTQ10:9b contributes to its highest PCE. However, compared with other high performance non-fullerene acceptors such as IT-4F, the relatively low electron mobility (10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) of SubNcTIs is one of the key factors limiting its photovoltaic performance.

Charge recombination was measured depending on the J–V characteristics in different light intensities. As shown in Fig. 5a, the slopes (α) are 0.76, 0.80, 0.77 and 0.38 for the 9a, 9b, 10a and 10b based devices respectively. The results demonstrate that the bimolecular charge recombination is efficiently suppressed in 9a, 9b, and 10a based devices. The charge collection probability (Pdiss) of the devices is estimated by measuring the dependence of photocurrent on the effective voltage. As shown in Fig. 5b, Pdiss is 63.92% for the 9b-based device which is the highest among these solar cells. All these data suggest less charge recombination and better charge transport in the PTQ10:9b blend, which favors its high performance.

Morphology characterization
To investigate the morphological features of the neat and blend films of PTQ10 and SubNcTIs, GIWAXS was carried out. The lamellar distances as revealed by the (100) peaks in the in-plane direction of neat SubNcTIs films (Fig. 6a and c) are 24.25 Å for 9a (q = 0.259 Å−1), 25.41 Å for 9b (q = 0.247 Å−1), 26.12 Å for 10a (q = 0.241 Å−1), and 22.99 Å for 10b (q = 0.273 Å−1), respectively. It's obvious that the lamellar distances are strongly affected by the different substituents on SubNcTIs. Only 9b exhibited faint π–π packing with a calculated d-spacing of 3.61 Å by the (010) peaks at 1.739 Å−1, while the other three SubNcTIs do not display obvious (010) π–π stacking diffraction along either the in-plane or out-of-plane direction. The results indicated that SubNcTIs prefer to adopt an edge-on π–π stacking relative to the substrate. As shown in Fig. 6c, the strong (010) peak of neat PTQ10 suggests a strong face-on orientation perpendicular to the substrate, which is beneficial to adjust the crystalline behavior of the BHJ film and enhance the efficient charge transport property.
 Fig. 6  (a and b) GIWAXS images and (c and d) corresponding line cuts of neat and blend films. 
For the blend films, a clear diffraction (100) peak and (010) peak can be observed in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, respectively (Fig. 6b and d). Compared with the 9a, 10a, and 10b system, the PTQ10:9b film exhibits a stronger (010) diffraction signal in the out-of-plane direction, indicating preferable face-on orientation, which is beneficial for charge transport in the vertical direction across the electrodes.51 Calculated by Scherrer's equation, PTQ10:9b shows a relatively higher crystallite coherence length (CCL) value of 31.18 Å as well as a tighter π–π packing distance of 3.50 Å along the out-of-plane direction (the face-on CCL010 values for PTQ10:9a = 24.03 Å, PTQ10:10a = 29.90 Å, and PTQ10:10b = 31.00 Å). This is favorable for charge transfer and transport towards achieving a high Jsc of the PTQ10:9b-based OSC device.
The optimized morphologies of the PTQ10:SubNcTI blend films were also investigated using AFM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 7, a larger root-mean-square surface (RMS) roughness of 2.11 nm for the 9b blend than for the 9a, 10a, and 10b blends (RMS of 1.67, 1.36, and 1.20 nm respectively), and the fibril structure are apparent in the phase images of the PTQ10:9b film. The relatively large surface roughness and fibril structure contribute to appropriate phase separation.52 As shown in the TEM images (Fig. S11, ESI†), the nanoscale phase separation of the PTQ10:SubNcTI films could be observed.

Conclusions
In summary, four SubNcTI acceptors were synthesized successfully, in which three imide groups could lower their LUMO energy levels and the substituents at B or N atoms could adjust their solubility and crystallinity effectively. Because of their high stability, appropriate energy levels, and strong NIR absorption, these compounds are excellent solution processable acceptors for photovoltaic devices. These acceptors could match with many electron donors in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. Preliminary screening results indicated that SubNcTI-based solar cells reached a power conversion efficiency of 6.25%, matching with the electron donor of polymer PTQ10. The morphology study showed that PTQ10:SubNcTIs films displayed strong intermolecular π–π stacking and nanoscale phase separation, which are favorable for high photovoltaic performances. As new acceptor chromophores, more functional semiconductors derived from these SubNcTIs are currently under construction in our laboratory.
