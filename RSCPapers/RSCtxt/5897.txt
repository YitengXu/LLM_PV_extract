    , Accepted 22nd September 2015First published on 30th September 2015AbstractCH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite material has been commonly used as the free charge generator and reservoir in highly efficient perovskite-based solid-state solar photovoltaic devices. However, many of the underlying fundamental photophysical mechanisms in this material such as the perovskite transition band structure as well as the dependent relationship between the carrier properties and lattice properties still lack sufficient understanding. Here, we elucidated the fundamental band structure of the pure CH3NH3PbI3−xClx pervoskite lattice, and then reported about the dependent relationship between the free charge carrier characteristic and the different CH3NH3PbI3−xClx pervoskite lattice thin films utilizing femtosecond time-resolved pump–probe technologies. The data demonstrated that the pure perovskite crystal band structure should only have one conduction and one valence band rather than dual valences, and the pure perovskite lattice could trigger more free charge carriers with a slower recombination rate under an identical pump intensity compared with the impurities doped perovskite crystal. We also investigated the perovskite film performance when exposed to moisture and water, the corresponding results gave us a dip in the optimization of the performance of perovskite based devices, and so as a priority this material should be isolated from moisture (water). This work may propose a deeper perspective on the comprehension for this material and it is useful for future optimization of applications in photovoltaic and light emission devices.
Introduction
The past three decades have witnessed tremendous research which focused on high-efficiency solid-state solar photovoltaic devices utilizing different materials and structures.1–4 Excitingly, five years ago, the development of solid-state solar photovoltaic devices attained a new milestone when the family of organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials emerged with a high reported power conversion efficiency (PCE).5–8 Its extraordinary performances, such as the ability to combine the perfect characteristics of organic (low temperature process) and inorganic (high charge carrier mobility) materials, and the ability to tune the band-edge from the ultraviolet to infrared range by changing the composition of various halogen anions (Cl−1, Br−1, I−1)9 or metal cations (Pb2+, Sn2+),10 have brought these materials to the forefront of the photovoltaic research field. Research efforts have almost penetrated the whole breadth of these materials in recent years; different device architectures, such as mesoporous configurations8,11–13 and different ABX39,10 frameworks have been investigated for solid-state solar cell application. Among the various perovskite absorbers, the mixed CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite has become a commonly used chemical formula to represent the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite as the former has a free charge carrier diffusion length that is significantly longer14,15 due to the negligible doped amount (<1%) of Cl atoms.16
In the perovskite solar cell field, rapid progress on improving the PCE of the perovskite-based solid-solar cell has been achieved and some fundamental physics of perovskites has been reported by some published work, Yamada et al.18 has clearly defined that the recombination process in this material is dominated by free electron and hole band-to-band recombination. This recombination process is due to the low exciton binding energy11,18–22 (a few meV). Scientists have explained the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite carrier properties, however, the band structure of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite thin films as well as the dependent relationship between the carrier properties and lattice properties are still open questions. In order to deeply understand the perovskite band structure and photophysics, we performed comprehensive experiments on the pure and decomposed impurities doped perovskite films by ultrafast transient spectroscopy.23 The results demonstrated that the pure perovskite lattice should only have one conduction and one valence band rather than dual valences, and the pure perovskite lattices could trigger more free charge carriers with a slower recombination rate under identical pump intensity compared with the impurities doped perovskite crystal lattice.
Results and discussion
In the present work, the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films are prepared by spin-coating a precursor solution of CH3NH3I (MAI) and PbCl2 in dimethylformamide (DMF) at a ∼3:1 molar ratio in a nitrogen filled glove box followed by thermal annealing at around ∼80 °C in a nitrogen filled glove box. The conditions of the nitrogen filled glove box are H2O < 0.1 ppm and O2 < 0.1 ppm. The perovskite films gradually crystallized along with the thermal annealing process; pure and excessively thermally decomposed perovskite lattice films were prepared by tuning the annealing time. It is important to note that the aim was for the samples to be stable during the subsequent experiments, so all of the perovskite films were left standing in the nitrogen filled glove box for 24 hours. The XRD (X-ray diffraction) of the different perovskite thin films was performed using a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (measured in air). Absorption spectra measurements were performed by a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer and the emission spectrum was measured by a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer (measured in air). TA spectra were obtained by femtosecond time-resolved pump–probe technology and the carrier dynamic traces were obtained by controlling the relative delay between the pump and the probe pulses with a stepper-motor-driven optical delay line. If the perovskite thin films were stable in air for a few days, then the spectroscopic measurement was performed in air immediately after the perovskite films were taken out of the nitrogen filled glove box, the spectroscopic moisture measurement was ∼20% and the temperature was 25 °C without any other light.
Firstly, we examined the free charge carrier kinetic characteristic of typical CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite films (thermally annealed for ∼200 min).8,9,14,17,18,24Fig. 1a displays the optical absorption spectrum of a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film ranging from the NIR to VIS range. The onset of the interband absorption shown in the inset can be identified as being centered at 754 nm (∼1.645 eV), which is in agreement with previously published data. The near-band-edge optical absorption shows an abrupt increase in the absorption coefficient which is typically observed in many direct-gap semiconductors. The PL (photoluminescence) emission spectrum of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film shows a strong emission at 765 nm (∼1.621 eV).14 The PL spectrum has no significant Stokes shift with a FWHM (full width at half-maximum) of 50 nm (105 meV). As shown in Fig. 1b, the TA spectra (pumped under 400 nm with the intensity at 9.2 μJ cm−2) show two ground state bleaching signals at 754 nm (∼1.621 eV, it is approximately equal to the band gap energy) and 485 nm (2.557 eV, it had been previously considered as the VB2 to CB1 transitions in the dual valence band structure17), as well as the broad excited-state absorption centered at 600 nm. These transient signals are caused by photobleaching, and the shape of the spectra is independent of the pump intensities. The time-resolved difference TA spectra show the recovery of the photoinduced bleaching as free charge carrier recombination, as the relaxation of the band-edge transition could last in the timescale of nanoseconds. The arrow indicates the direction of the ground state bleach recovery. Here, we worked on the characteristic of the 754 nm photoinduced bleach to probe the band-edge charge carrier dynamics in this typical CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film. Fig. 1c shows the optical density change (ΔOD) after photoexcitation at 400 nm for a range of pump intensities between 1.1 and 20.2 μJ cm−2. The ΔOD intensity reflects the band-edge photocarrier density. In the presence of free charge carriers, the measured dynamics show strong pump-intensity dependence: the kinetic recombination rates become faster with increasing pump intensities. The TA intensity (inset) and the effective lifetime are illustrated in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† Now, we emphatically examine the kinetics of the two ground state bleaching signals at 485 nm and 754 nm. Fig. 1d shows the slow transient bleaching build-up in ∼10 ps for the band-gap transition at ∼754 nm, and this is indicative of the charge carrier accumulation based on the band filling effect.18 While for the signal at 485 nm, the dynamics shows a very fast bleaching build-up which is close to the laser pulse duration with a faster recombination rate. This difference indicates that the transition signal at 485 nm is not the intrinsic energy level transition in the band structure of the perovskite lattice, and the pure perovskite lattice should not have other bleaching signals except the band-edge absorption bleaching at ∼754 nm. We will proceed to demonstrate this hypothesis in following studies.
 Fig. 1  (a) Absorption (blue line) and photoluminescence (red line) of typical CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite films. The inset shows the spectra details of the band-edge. (b) Time-resolved transient absorption spectra of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx at different probe delay times following 400 nm laser excitation with an energy density of 9.2 μJ cm−2. Arrows indicate transient bleach recovery. (c) Transient band-edge bleaching kinetics at 754 nm after 400 nm excitation for pump intensities between 1.1 and 20.2 μJ cm−2. Higher excitation intensities result in an increased rate of band-edge recombination. (d) Normalized bleaching kinetics at 485 nm and 754 nm of typical CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite thin film after excitation at 400 nm (9.2 μJ cm−2). 
Precursor films annealed under ∼80 °C for 70 min (pure lattice), 100 min (slightly thermally decomposed/impurities doped lattice), and 150 min (strongly thermally decomposed/impurities doped lattice) were prepared. We find that the absorption spectra displayed in Fig. 2a for all three investigated CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite lattices are very different. The absorption coefficient of the interband absorption centered at 754 nm (∼1.645 eV) decreased with the increasing annealing time from 70 min to 150 min, and meanwhile, the absorption coefficient of the decomposed products at ∼500 nm increased. We find that the spectra around the band-edge (shown in the inset of Fig. 2a) are independent of the excessive thermal decomposing process. Fig. 2a tells us that the perfect crystallization process finished when the annealing time reached up to ∼70 min, and during the excessive annealing time from 70 min to 150 min, we suspect that the partial perovskite crystal was thermally decomposed to several other mixtures of impurities. In order to define the different perovskite lattices’ characteristics, we performed XRD measurements on the 70, 100 and 150 min annealed precursor films to observe the lattice pattern of the pure and impurities doped lattices. We also performed scanning electronic microscope (SEM) measurements on the 70 and 150 min annealed precursor films and the images are shown in Fig. S2 of the ESI.† As shown in the XRD spectra in Fig. 2b, three perovskite peaks at 14.54°, 28.88° and 44.51° correlating to the (110), (220) and (330) diffractions of the perovskite crystal can be readily read in all three annealed perovskite films.16 Here we mainly focus on the lattice pattern of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and the decomposition product PbI2 lattice. The excessive decomposing process will trigger the generation of doped impurities decomposed from the pure perovskite lattices. We find that the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx XRD peak intensities decreased along with excessive thermal decomposition from 70 min to 150 min, while the decomposition product PbI216 XRD peak became more pronounced. This XRD trend is consistent with the decreased absorption coefficient of the band-edge displayed in Fig. 2a. Moreover, we find the FWHM of the perovskite XRD peaks illustrated in Fig. S3 of the ESI† increased with the excessive thermal process. The broadening of the perovskite peaks in the XRD spectra is indicative of the decreased lattice quality during the impurities generation process. Fig. 2a and b have unambiguously indicated that the precursor films annealed for 70 min have been crystallized to almost pure perovskite lattices. The pure perovskite film possesses the largest quantity (XRD peak intensity) and best quality lattice (XRD spectra FWHM), and the pure perovskite lattice was gradually thermally decomposed with the generation of impurities after continuation of the followed annealing process. Such a study is currently ongoing, and a few works that studied the different perovskite lattice phases have been published recently.25 The steady-state absorption spectrum of the pure perovskite lattice shows a continuous absorption with only a band-gap at 754 nm, and we aimed to gain a deeper comprehension of this absorption property, so as shown in Fig. 2c–e we performed femtosecond time-resolved pump–probe measurements for the pure/slightly impurities doped/strongly impurities doped perovskite films under 400 nm excitation with an identical pump intensity of 4.5 μJ cm−2 respectively. All these TA spectra have two common features: the photoinduced transient bleach at ∼754 nm and the signal recovery could last in the timescale of nanoseconds. These TA spectra also exhibit three stark differences: the photoinduced excited-state absorption in the range of 500–700 nm, the photoinduced transient bleach signal at ∼485 nm, and the intensity of the transient bleaching of the band-edge transition at ∼754 nm. Fig. 2c displays the TA spectra of the pure perovskite lattice which only shows the transient bleaching of the band-edge transition at ∼754 nm without any excited-state absorption and other decomposition products bleaching signals. Along with the excessive thermal decomposing process, the TA spectra properties display one important trend: the transient bleaching signal intensity of the band-edge at ∼754 nm decreased, and meanwhile, the excited-state absorption signal centered at ∼600 nm and the decomposition bleaching signal at ∼485 nm appeared and became more pronounced. The bleaching signal position of band-edge is invariant during the thermal decomposing process. The signal intensity changing trend in the TA spectra is consistent with that from the steady absorption and XRD measurements. It is noteworthy that the bleaching at 485 nm is not the intrinsic absorption (∼500 nm) of the PbI2 lattice, this bleaching is impurity-assisted and it reflects the decomposition intensity of the perovskite lattice. The results of Fig. 2 have demonstrated that the pure CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite band structure only has one valence and one conduction band, for its perfect spectra characteristics: steady absorption with only a band-gap at 754 nm and the corresponding lone transient bleaching at ∼754 nm in the TA spectra. In the case of the thermally decomposed perovskite film, the kinetic build-up and recombination rate of the two bleaching signals illustrated in Fig. 1d are different, the bleaching at 485 nm is exciton-analogous which is different from the band-edge bleaching at ∼754 nm whose recombination mode is based on the free charge carrier style. These kinetics demonstrate that the bleaching at 485 nm is an impurity-assisted exciton-analogous recombination mode, so it is not the intrinsic energy level transition in the band structure.

Arrows indicate transient bleach recovery, and the dash line indicates the impurity-assisted bleaching signal. 
We proceed to unravel the free charge carrier transient properties in these perovskite films at room temperature. Fig. 3a–c display the free charge carrier generated intensity and the kinetic recombination at the interband transition (∼754 nm) of the pure/slightly impurities doped/strongly impurities doped perovskite films respectively. These kinetics follow photoexcitation under 400 nm with a range of different pump intensities between 1.2 μJ cm−2 and 9.5 μJ cm−2. The ΔOD intensity reflects the band-edge photocarrier density. In the presence of free charges, all of the measured TA dynamics show strong pump-intensity dependence. High pump intensities result in an increased rate of band-edge recombination. We find that the pure perovskite lattice could trigger more free charge carriers with a slower recombination rate under identical pump intensity compared with the impurities doped perovskite crystal. This is because the pure perovskite thin film possesses the largest quantity (XRD peak intensity) and the best quality lattice (XRD spectra FWHM). Fig. 3d displays the carrier recombination dynamics of these three perovskite lattices under identical ΔOD/carrier intensity, taking for granted the fact that the pure perovskite film recombination rate is much slower with rare defect-assisted trap states. Fig. 3 illustrates that the excessive thermal decomposing process is detrimental for optimizing the performance of the perovskite optical devices, as the thermal decomposing process reduced the quantity and perfection of the perovskite lattice and induced the impurity-assisted recombination channel which accelerated the recombination rate, and then reduced the diffusion length. These investigations gave us a good suggestion that we could get a perfect perovskite lattice by choosing an appropriate annealing time based on the synthesis conditions. We also exhibit the kinetic profiles of the 485 nm bleaching signal of the perovskites annealed for different times under identical pump intensity in Fig. S4 of the ESI.† The decay rate becomes faster in the stronger decomposed perovskite films.

Higher excitation intensities result in an increased rate of band-edge recombination. The pure perovskite lattice could trigger more free charge carriers with a slower recombination rate under identical pump intensity compared with the thermally decomposed perovskite crystal. (d) The transient band-edge bleach kinetics at the identical transient signal intensity for these three perovskite lattices, the recombination rate of pure perovskite lattice is the slowest, as its recombination is totally dominated by free charge carriers. 
The results of Fig. 2 and 3 have shown the detailed relationship between the optical and structural properties of the perovskite films, and XRD measurements were used to verify the perovskite lattice quantity and quality under different thermal annealing times in a nitrogen filled glove box. The perfect perovskite lattice exhibits the strongest and narrowest XRD peaks without other doping species. The pure perovskite lattice possesses continuous absorption with only a band-gap at 754 nm, and its lone bleaching signal in the transient absorption clarified that the band structure of perovskite only has one valence and one conduction band. The perovskite will decompose into the doping species (impurities) when the thermal annealing exceeds the optimal conditions (time or temperature), the decomposition reduced the lattice quality (the absorption intensity at ∼754 nm) and induced the absorption shoulder at ∼485 nm, correspondingly, the bleaching signal in the transient absorption. The pure films possess more lattices which generate many more free-charge carriers. Due to the rare defect-assisted trap states in the pure lattice, these free-charge carriers exhibit the slowest kinetic recombination rate. As shown in Fig. 3, the carrier dynamics properties of the pure perovskite lattice exceed the performance of the doped lattice in carrier quality and life-time under identical pump intensity.
Perovskite material films are very sensitive to their exposed environment, and the pure perovskite film will decompose to an impurities-doped perovskite film without compact packing. Here we will reveal the photophysical characteristics of the perovskite films exposed to air (20%), moisture (∼80%), and water respectively. Fig. 4a displays the optical absorption spectrum of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films exposed to the different environments, ranging from NIR to VIS. In the visible optical range of NIR to VIS, we only consider the decomposition product PbI2 lattice. The decomposition product PbI2 began to play a role with the increasing infiltrated water amount, and meanwhile, the decomposition absorption shoulder shifts to 500 nm gradually. The absorption coefficient of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite interband absorption centered at 754 nm decreased and the inset shows that the spectra shoulder position around the band-edge is independent to the water amount. In order to observe the lattice patterns, we also performed XRD measurements on the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films exposed to air, moisture, and water respectively. As the XRD spectra show in Fig. 4b, the peak at 12.82° corresponding to PbI2 can be readily read in all three thin films, this peak becomes more pronounced with increasing infiltrated water amounts and meanwhile, the perovskite XRD peaks at 14.54° and 28.88° correlating to the (110) and (220) diffractions of the perovskite crystal disappear gradually. This XRD peak trend is consistent with the spectra displayed in Fig. 2b. Then, we performed femtosecond pump–probe measurements for the moisture-/water-exposed CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films under a 400 nm pump with an identical intensity of 9.2 μJ cm−2. The corresponding TA spectra are shown in Fig. 4c and d respectively. The photoinduced transient bleach at ∼500 nm in Fig. 4c indicates the presence of the decomposition product PbI2 and this ΔOD bleach intensity increased in the water-exposed CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film, and meanwhile the transient signal intensities of the band-edge transition at ∼754 nm disappeared. This signal intensity change in the TA spectra is consistent with that from the steady absorption and XRD measurements. Fig. 4c and d have demonstrated that along with the water decomposing process in the perovskite lattice, the generated decomposition product PbI2 further changed the optical characteristics, and also illustrated that the bleaching at ∼500 nm is mainly controlled by PbI218 rather than the transition from VB2 to VB1. The presence of the decomposition product PbI2 is indicative of the impurity-assisted recombination in the decomposed perovskite films which will result in the faster kinetic recombination rate. Fig. 4e displays the carrier recombination dynamics of the air/moisture/water-exposed perovskite films at identical ΔOD intensity, taking for granted the fact that the kinetic recombination rate of the band-edge at ∼754 nm is faster in the perovskite film with more infiltrated water in the presence of the stronger impurity-assisted recombination. The perovskite films exposed to the water have been totally decomposed to the PbI2 crystal, and the dynamics of the ∼500 nm signal shows the exciton recombination mode of the PbI2. The results from Fig. 4 have suggested that the performance of a mature perovskite thin film is sensitively dependent on the exposed environment (especially, the moisture), so the study on the protection of the perovskite lattice still needs continued studying.

Conclusions
In conclusion, firstly, we examined the photocarrier relaxation dynamics of a typical CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film by means of femtosecond time-resolved pump–probe spectroscopy. And then, we mainly studied to understand the band structures and free charge carrier kinetic characteristics of the pure and impurities doped CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite lattices. The experiment results demonstrated that the pure perovskite lattice band structure should only have one conduction and one valence band rather than dual valences, and the pure perovskite lattice could trigger more free charge carriers with a slower recombination rate under an identical pump intensity compared with the impurities doped perovskite lattice. At last, we also investigated the carrier kinetic characteristics of the air/moisture/water-exposed perovskite films, and the results indicate that for optimizing the performance of perovskite based devices, this material as a priority should be isolated from moisture (water).

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Absorption (blue line) and photoluminescence (red line) of typical CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite films. The inset shows the spectra details of the band-edge. (b) Time-resolved transient absorption spectra of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx at different probe delay times following 400 nm laser excitation with an energy density of 9.2 μJ cm−2. Arrows indicate transient bleach recovery. (c) Transient band-edge bleaching kinetics at 754 nm after 400 nm excitation for pump intensities between 1.1 and 20.2 μJ cm−2. Higher excitation intensities result in an increased rate of band-edge recombination. (d) Normalized bleaching kinetics at 485 nm and 754 nm of typical CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite thin film after excitation at 400 nm (9.2 μJ cm−2).	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Absorption of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite precursor films annealed for 70 min, 100 min and 150 min. The inset shows the spectra details of the band-edge. (b) XRD patterns for the precursor films annealed for 70 min (pure), 100 min (slightly impurities doped) and 150 min (strongly impurities doped). The dash line indicates the varying amounts of PbI2 crystal. Time-resolved transient absorption spectra of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite precursor films annealed for 70 min (c), 100 min (d) and 150 min (e) at different probe delay times following 400 nm laser excitation with an energy density of 4.5 μJ cm−2. Arrows indicate transient bleach recovery, and the dash line indicates the impurity-assisted bleaching signal.	 

 	Fig. 3  Kinetic profiles of 754 nm transient bleach recovery of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite precursor films annealed for 70 min (a), 100 min (b) and 150 min (c) after 400 nm excitation for pump intensities between 1.2 and 9.5 μJ cm−2. Higher excitation intensities result in an increased rate of band-edge recombination. The pure perovskite lattice could trigger more free charge carriers with a slower recombination rate under identical pump intensity compared with the thermally decomposed perovskite crystal. (d) The transient band-edge bleach kinetics at the identical transient signal intensity for these three perovskite lattices, the recombination rate of pure perovskite lattice is the slowest, as its recombination is totally dominated by free charge carriers.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Absorption of air/moisture/water-exposed CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskites. The inset shows the spectra details of the band-edge. (b) XRD patterns for the air/moisture/water-exposed CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskites. The dash line indicates the varying amounts of PbI2 crystal. Time-resolved transient absorption spectra of moisture (c)/water (d)-exposed CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskites at different probe delay times following 400 nm laser excitation with an energy density of 9.2 μJ cm−2, arrows indicate transient bleach recovery. (e) The transient band-edge bleaching kinetics at identical transient signal intensity for air/moisture/water-perovskite lattices.
