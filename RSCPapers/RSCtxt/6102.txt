    , Accepted 24th October 2020First published on 26th October 2020AbstractDihydroxybenzenes (DHB) are one of the most important fine chemicals used as raw materials or intermediates in industries. One-step selective phenol hydroxylation using a photo-Fenton system is an attractive and challenging strategy, especially under long-wavelength irradiation. Herein, we report that a highly selective photo-driven Fenton hydroxylation reaction of phenol to DHB can be achieved over NiFe-layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiFe-NS) under visible-light irradiation with 70% phenol conversion and ∼99% DHB selectivity. A more interesting finding is that a high phenol conversion (∼40%) activity can be maintained even under monochromatic irradiation at 550 nm. The superior photocatalytic activity was attributed to the abundant defects in NiFe-NS, which facilitated the adsorption of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) onto the catalyst surface and promoted the transfer efficiency of photoinduced electrons from the catalyst to H2O2, generating ˙OH radicals to participate in the hydroxylation of phenol.
Introduction
The Fenton reaction, typically occurring between hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ferric ions, can continuously generate an abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as ˙OH and HO2˙,1–5 which show effective oxidation activity in organic pollutant degradation,6–10 antitumor therapy,11–13 medical treatment,14etc. However, the following several disadvantages of the Fenton-like process restrict the scale-up of the practical application especially in fine chemical synthesis: uncontrollable oxidation reactivity, poor stability of the catalyst as well as the acidic reaction conditions.15–19 Recently, photo-driven Fenton reactions have used additional light irradiation to accelerate the formation of ROS under mild conditions,20–24 providing an alternative and green technology for the efficiently selective oxidation reaction. However, most of the reported photo-Fenton systems have a very low utilization in solar energy (only response to UV or visible-light range from 400–500 nm),25,26 thus the utilization of much long-wavelength solar spectrum (i.e. λ > 550 nm) for the photo-driven Fenton catalysis is indeed significant in the further industry application for efficient solar energy storage and conversion.27
Dihydroxybenzenes (DHB), as one of the most important raw materials for auxiliary agents and intermediates, have been fundamentally applied in today's chemical industries.17,28–31 The direct one-step hydroxylation of phenol to DHB based on the Fenton reaction is a widely used process due to the simple operation, few by-products, and environmental friendliness. However, except for its low conversion or selectivity, the traditional industrial processes of DHB synthesis normally depend on harsh reaction conditions such as high temperatures and highly acidic environments with unavoidable use of uneconomic solvents.32–34 Given the sustainable process and the demand for the green chemical industry, it is highly desirable to explore efficient heterogeneous photocatalysts for the Fenton-driven phenol hydroxylation under mild conditions.
In recent decades, ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have attracted increasing attention as catalysts due to their abundant active defect sites, controllable electronic structures, and outstanding charge separation properties.35–41 As a class of 2D brucite-like layered anionic materials, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have a common formula of [M1–x2+ Mx3+]x+ (An−)x/n,·mH2O where M2+, M3+ and An− represent bivalent and trivalent metal cations and interlayer anions, respectively.42,43 The tunable chemical composition and controllable morphology enable LDHs to exhibit great photocatalytic activity in various types of reactions such as activating H–O, C–H, CO, NN, and NO bonds in H2O,44–46 benzene,47 CO2,48–50 N251 and NO molecules,52,53 respectively, arousing great attention in solar-driven catalysis.54,55 In recent years, several studies have reported that the ultrathin LDHs with a smaller particle size and thickness have superior catalytic performance to the bulk counterparts.56–60 As the size and thickness decrease, more defects can be generated on the surface of nanomaterials with the formation of coordinately unsaturated sites, leading to superior catalytic performance.61–66 For instance, the introduction of oxygen vacancies (VO) can improve the adsorption capacity and photoinduced charge transfer efficiency of ultrathin LDHs nanosheets, which is of crucial importance to improve the photocatalysis, such as N2 photofixation.51 Very recently, our group proved that via precisely controlling the thickness of the LDH structure, the monolayer LDH catalyst exhibited promoted photocatalytic selectivity of CO2 reduction to CH4 even under irradiation above 600 nm, providing an efficient pathway for improving the photocatalytic selectivity.48 Given that, LDH nanostructures with defects would be up-and-coming photo-driven Fenton catalysts for the phenol hydroxylation to synthesise DHB under mild conditions.
In this work, we synthesized ultrathin NiFe-LDH nanosheets (denoted as NiFe-NS) photocatalyst engineered with abundant defects by the co-precipitation method, and NiFe-NS exhibited high conversion of phenol (∼40%) and selectivity of DHB (>99%) under visible-light irradiation even at a wavelength of 550 nm. The introduction of defects was the key to this superior photocatalytic property of NiFe-NS. As proved by X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the defects (especially hydroxyl defects) in NiFe-NS acted as active sites for the adsorption of H2O2 and promoted the charge transfer from NiFe-NS to H2O2, resulting in the generation of ˙OH that reacted with phenol to produce DHB (Fig. 1). This work identifies a cost-effective pathway for DHB synthesis using LDH nanosheet photocatalysts under mild conditions.

Experimental section
Materials
Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, NaNO3 and TiCl4 were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd. Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was obtained from Xilong Scientific Co., Ltd. Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was purchased from Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagents Factory. NaOH and hydrogen peroxide (30 wt% aqueous solution) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. Phenol (99.5%) was obtained from TCI (Shanghai) Development Co., Ltd. All the reagents were used without further purification. Deionized water was used in all the experimental processes.
Synthesis of catalysts

Synthesis of NiFe-LDH nanosheets (denoted as NiFe-NS). 
Typically, the NiFe-NS was prepared by a co-precipitation process.67 Solution A was prepared by dissolving 32 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 10.7 mmol Fe(NO3)3·9H2O in 40 mL water; 68.3 mmol NaOH and 21.3 mmol NaNO3 were dissolved in 40 mL water to get solution B. Solutions A and B were simultaneously added dropwise into 80 mL water to adjust the pH to 8.5. The final precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed several times with water and then dried at 60 °C for 24 h.


Synthesis of bulk NiFe-LDH (denoted as NiFe-Bulk). 
The precipitate obtained by the above procedure was further transferred to an autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 10 h. The solid products were collected by centrifugation, washed several times with water, and dried at 60 °C for 24 h.


Synthesis of MIIMIII-LDH nanosheets (denoted as MIIMIII-NS). 
An analogous procedure to the synthesis of the NiFe-NS material was used but with the same molar quantities of corresponding nitrate of divalent and trivalent metals instead of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, respectively. For the synthesis of NiTi-NS, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and TiCl4 were used to prepare the salt solution (solution A). The pH of the final solution was adjusted to 10 for MgFe-NS, 9 for CoAl-NS, 8.5 for NiMIII-NS and ZnMIII-NS, and 5.5 for CuMIII-NS, respectively.68 The washing and drying methods are consistent with those in the synthesis of NiFe-NS.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were characterized using a Rigaku XRD-6000 diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5405 Å). Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analytical data were obtained using a Zeiss Supra 55 SEM equipped with an EDX detector. High-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. UV-visible spectra were recorded using a Beijing PGENERAL TU-1901 spectrometer. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker EPR 300E spectrometer. The Ni and Fe K-edge XAFS were collected at the 1W1B beamline of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. EXAFS shell fitting was carried out using the Artemis software.48
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed using a CHI660A electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China) with a standard three-electrode quartz cell. An LDH modified carbon paper electrode was employed as the working electrode, while a Pt electrode was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in a KOH solution (1 M) by placing the sample on a carbon paper (1 cm2). The photocurrent measurements were performed in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution using a 300 W Xe-lamp (using a 400 nm cutoff filter) as the light source. The working electrode was prepared by coating the catalyst dispersed in 30 vol% ethanol aqueous solution onto an ITO glass substrate. The surface of the working electrode was 1 cm2 in area and 0.02 cm in thickness. A Pt electrode was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode. The Mott–Schottky test was also carried out in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution.48
Photocatalytic phenol hydroxylation test
In a 40 mL glass tube, 30 mg catalyst, 450 μL (5 mmol) phenol, and 20 mL deionized water were first taken. After 1 min of stirring, 510 μL (5 mmol) H2O2 (30 wt% aqueous solution) was added into the reaction mixture. As shown in Fig. S1,† the reaction tube was placed in a glass condensing tube, and the gap between the reactor tube and the condensing tube was filled with water to ensure heat transfer. The water in the condensing tube flowed continuously to keep the reaction system at 25 °C. During the reaction, the visible light (400–800 nm) emitted by a 300 W Xe lamp irradiated one side of the reaction tube, and the outlet of light is about 0.5 cm away from the condensing tube. The liquid in the reactor tube is continuously stirred at high speed to ensure uniform irradiation. The Xenon lamp source was PLS-SXE300D of Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd. After the reaction, the product was extracted using a syringe, filtered through a nylon membrane to remove the catalyst particles, and then analyzed by Shimadzu GC-2010 chromatography (HP-5, 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) equipped with FID detectors. The conversion of the reactant, as well as the selectivity of the products, was determined by GC by both the internal standard method using o-cresol as the internal standard and the external standard method. For a photocatalytic phenol hydroxylation reaction, only catechol (CAT) and hydroquinone (HQ) can be detected using NiFe-NS, while some overoxidized products (mainly benzoquinone) can be observed using NiFe-Bulk from GC-2010. The concentration of H2O2 during the reaction was quantified by the iodometric titration method as reported.69 For the recycling tests, the catalysts were centrifuged and washed several times for further use.
Computational details for band structure calculations
Plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to model multilayered Ni3Fe-LDH structures and Ni3Fe-LDH with hydroxyl, Fe and Ni vacancies, using the U + CASTEP module in Material Studio (values of U − J (Ueff) were set as 3.87 eV for Ni, and 4.30 eV for Fe).70 A Ni3Fe-LDH supercell was adopted based on an initial structure with lattice parameters α = β = 90°, γ = 120°, a = b = 6.294 Å. The parameter c for the multilayered Ni3Fe-LDH was obtained from the experimental X-ray diffraction data in this work. The molar ratio of Ni2+:Fe3+ in the LDH matrix was 3. The supercell of NiFe-LDH was 1 × 1 × 1 in the a-, b-, and c-directions. Nitrate anions are intercalated into the interlayer space of NiFe-LDH. The electron exchange and correlation energy were treated with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional in generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The optimal adsorption site was calculated by Adsorption Locator Tools in Material Studio.43
Results and discussion
As reported, Fe-containing heterogeneous catalysts have been considered as potential catalysts for phenol hydroxylation due to the effective Fenton route. Therefore, Fe-containing MFe-LDH nanosheets (denoted as MFe-NS, M = Mg, Co, Ni, and Cu) had been synthesized by the co-precipitation procedure. As shown in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. S2†), a series of (00l) Bragg diffraction peaks of all MFe-NS illustrated the stack-up of LDHs materials with a layer structure. The scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images (Fig. S3†) revealed that NiFe-NS and related other LDH nanosheets had a platelet morphology, which provided the experimental evidence for the successful preparation of LDH nanosheets. In particular, the high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) images and atomic force microscopic (AFM) images (Fig. 2A, C and D) suggested that NiFe-NS had a size of ∼50 nm and a thickness of ∼5 nm. A lattice fringe spacing of ∼0.20 nm corresponding to the (018) planes of NiFe-NS was found in Fig. 2B, which was in accordance with fast Fourier transform (FFT) on the HRTEM image. The molar ratio of Ni:Fe was measured to be 3.25:1 by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy (Fig. S4†). In addition, we calculated the mass of the products for the synthesis of MFe-NS (Table S1†). This method could be used in the laboratory to synthesize LDH nanosheet products at gram levels in a very short time at a time. Furthermore, a larger number of LDH nanosheets products could be produced in the factory using the separate nucleation and aging step (SNAS) process, which has achieved the annual production of several thousand tons of LDH. However, further hydrothermal treatment caused the growth of LDH nanosheets to transform into bulk NiFe-LDH (denoted as NiFe-Bulk; Fig. S5 and S6†) with a size of ∼100 nm and a thickness of 10–15 nm. Besides, other MFe-NS showed a similar ultrathin nanosheet morphology with a size of 50–100 nm (Fig. S3†). The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra also showed that MFe-NS gave a wide visible-light absorption range around 400–600 nm, except CoFe-NS that had strong absorption in the whole visible-light region as mainly due to the existence of Co ions (Fig. S7†). The wider absorption of the Fe-containing LDH favored the visible-light-induced photocatalysis, as discussed below.

Following the above characterization of the materials, all the samples were assessed for their capacity to catalyse the photocatalytic hydroxylation of phenol under visible-light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, the commercial photocatalyst TiO2 showed negligible activity with the conversion of less than 0.1% for phenol hydroxylation under visible-light, while no activity was observed over MgFe-NS and CoFe-NS under visible-light irradiation for 4 h; luckily, NiFe-NS and CuFe-NS showed a higher phenol conversion (39.74% and 11.95%, respectively). Higher selectivity of CAT was further observed over NiFe-NS (70.23%) than over CuFe-NS (49.05%). Such interesting results received our great attention. To further check the above-mentioned results, a series of controlled experiments in the absence of visible-light illumination, using NiFe-NS or H2O2 separately, were conducted. The results indicated a very low or even no photocatalytic efficiency (Fig. S8†), providing evidence that light source, photocatalysts, and oxidant agents were of vital importance to the hydroxylation of phenols. Therefore, the NiFe-NS was selected as a target for studying the effect of reaction conditions on the hydroxylation of phenol. As an oxidant, H2O2 was one of the keys to the hydroxylation of phenol. With the increase in H2O2 concentration from 250 mM to 750 mM (the molar ratio of H2O2/phenol rose from 1 to 3), the phenol conversion on NiFe-NS rose to nearly 70% and the selectivity of DHB remained above 99% (Fig. 3C). Further increasing the ratio of H2O2/phenol will cause waste of H2O2, which is not consistent with the requirements of green chemistry. Therefore, the catalytic performance under a H2O2-to-phenol ratio of 1:1 was selected for the further phenol hydroxylation reaction as discussed below. Besides, the photocatalytic performance of NiFe-NS at different time intervals was studied (Fig. S9†). It was apparent that conversion of around 30% was accomplished between one and three hours, while further prolongation of reaction time could not significantly raise the conversion, which was closely related to the consumption of H2O2 over time (Fig. S10†). The final pH of the reaction system after 4 h was similar to the initial pH (∼4.5). The selectivity of products had a similar change trend with the reaction time. NiFe-NS showed a deep visible-light absorption ability (Fig. 3D). Two characteristic bands at 350 and 450 nm were attributed to the d–d transitions 6A1g (S) → 4T2g, 4E2g (D) and 6A1g (S) → 4Eg, A1g (G) corresponding to FeIII in octahedral coordination, while the bands at 630 and 730 nm were associated with the spin forbidden transition 3A2g (F) → 1 T2g (D) and the spin-allowed transition 3A2g (F) → 3 T1g (P) coming from octahedral NiII in the layer structure, respectively.71,72 Thus, further investigating the photoactivity of NiFe-NS at different wavelengths of visible-light gained our interest. Therefore, the irradiation of NiFe-NS by monochromatic light with a wavelength of 405, 440, 470, and 550 nm and higher was performed for the phenol hydroxylation. Even under the irradiation of monochromatic light up to 550 nm, the NiFe-NS still exhibited high catalytic efficiency, phenol conversion of ∼40% and a DHB selectivity >99% in 4 h (Fig. 3D and S11†), indicating that the efficient utilization of light and fast reaction rates led to a similar conversion rate under monochromatic light to that under visible-light (>400 nm). However, the NiFe-NS showed almost no activity under irradiation above 600 nm, as the energy of near-infrared light (i.e. λ > 600 nm) was too low to drive the phenol hydroxylation reaction. Interestingly, the NiFe-NS maintained excellent reactivity and product selectivity under low power blue LED lamp (460 nm) irradiation, demonstrating the potential of further industrial production (Table S2†). Table S2† lists the previously reported Fenton-like approaches for phenol hydroxylation. Compared with most reported catalytic systems, this work not only achieved efficient photocatalysis under mild conditions, but also broke through the limitation of using UV light in photocatalysis and extended excellent reactivity to the long wavelength (550 nm), benefiting the effective utilization of solar energy. Moreover, the NiFe-NS exhibited superior stability with almost constant photocatalytic activity and stable LDH structure after four successively photocatalytic cycles (Fig. 3E and S12†). We also considered the photocatalysis of Fe-free Co/Ni/Cu/Zn-Al/Ti/Cr-LDH nanosheets (Fig. S13†) for comparison; however, only NiCr-NS, CuCr-NS, and ZnCr-NS showed a phenol conversion of less than 10% (Fig. S14†), indicating that suitable bandgap of the NiFe-NS provided a driving force for the efficient hydroxylation of phenol. From the above-mentioned results, it can conclude that through adjusting the composition of LDHs, the NiFe-NS with a suitable band structure provided an appropriate thermodynamic driving force for the efficient hydroxylation of phenol to DHB with H2O2.

(E) Phenol conversion and product selectivity over NiFe-NS and NiFe-Bulk under irradiation at >400 nm. (F) Catalyst cycling tests for NiFe-NS under irradiation at >400 nm. Reaction conditions: phenol (250 mM), 30 wt% H2O2 (250 mM), photocatalyst (30 mg), H2O (20 mL), visible-light irradiation, 25 °C, 4 h. The photocatalyst was thoroughly washed and dried after each recovery. 
Besides the band structure engineering of the LDH structure on the thermodynamic view, the morphology control over the LDH structure related to the formation of defects also provided a kinetic effect over the photoinduced carriers for photocatalysis. Compared with the NiFe-NS, the NiFe-Bulk structure exhibited only ∼12% conversion and ∼22% selectivity of DHB (Fig. 3F) with the formation of by-products such as benzoquinone. The NiFe-NS showed absolute superiority in both conversion and selectivity of photocatalytic hydroxylation of phenol to DHB, suggesting that some structural changes caused by reducing size and thickness could greatly affect the photocatalytic activity of LDHs. This will be discussed in the following sections.
To further evaluate the structural differences between the NiFe-NS and NiFe-Bulk on the different photocatalytic activity, X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS) was applied to determine the local coordination environment of metal cations in the samples. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) of the Ni K-edge NiFe-NS and NiFe-Bulk is shown in Fig. 4A. The NiFe-NS showed similar spectral features to that of NiFe-Bulk; however, some minor distinctions emerged above 8370 eV, indicating the different electronic structures of Ni species in the NiFe-NS and NiFe-Bulk. For the NiFe-NS, although extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) oscillations in k-space at each absorption edge were extraordinarily similar to that of NiFe-Bulk, the smaller amplitude suggested a different coordinate environment of Ni atoms in the NiFe-NS (Fig. 4C). The R-space of the NiFe-NS and NiFe-Bulk gave more critical information about Ni coordination in the LDH structure. As shown in Fig. 4E and Table S3,† the first shell (Ni–O) and the second shell (Ni–Ni/Fe) for the NiFe-NS exhibited a much lower intensity and a less coordination number (NNi–O = 5.3, NNi–Ni/Fe = 5.4) than those of NiFe-Bulk (NNi–O = 6, NNi–Ni/Fe = 6). This result indicated the co-existence of O, Ni, and Fe vacancies (VOH, VNi, and VFe). The same finding was also observed at Fe K-edge EXAFS (Fig. 4B, D and F, and Table S4†), further indicating that more defects existed in the NiFe-NS. It was obvious that VOH, VNi, and VFe were introduced when decreasing the thickness of LDH into the atomic scale. These vacancies were likely to play a pivotal role in changing the electronic structure and photocatalytic properties of the NiFe-NS. Therefore, to further study the structure–activity relationship in this system, electrochemical tests and DFT calculations were applied to verify the influence of the surface defects on the electronic structure and adsorption property of the NiFe-NS.

(B) Fe K-edge XANES spectra, (D) Fe K-edge EXAFS oscillation functions k3χ (k), and (F) magnitude of k3-weighted FT of the Fe K-edge EXAFS spectra for NiFe-Bulk and NiFe-NSs, respectively. 
The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. S15†) and Mott–Schottky curves (Fig. 5A) were obtained to further study the optical absorption properties and band structures of the NiFe-NS and NiFe-Bulk. Based on the Tauc plots (Fig. S15B†) and Mott–Schottky curves (Fig. 5A), the bandgap of the NiFe-NS was calculated to be 1.76 eV, and the top of the valence band (VB) and the bottom of the conduction band (CB) of the NiFe-NS were determined to be −0.45 eV and 1.31 eV vs. NHE (pH = 7) (Fig. S16†), respectively. Although the bandgap of the NiFe-NS (1.76 eV) was similar to that of NiFe-Bulk (1.78 eV) (Fig. S15B†), the CB potential of the NiFe-NS (−0.45 eV) was more negative than that of NiFe-Bulk (−0.30 eV) (Fig. S16†), providing a stronger thermodynamic driving force for the reduction of H2O2 to ˙OH73–77 to participate in the efficient hydroxylation of phenol. This result was also confirmed by EPR spectra78 (Fig. S17†) and free radical trapping experiments (Fig. S8†). Although H2O2 released some ˙OH due to its own photodecomposition, the presence of the NiFe-NS promoted H2O2 to produce more ˙OH (Fig. S17†). With the addition of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperinedinyloxy (TEMPO) as a sacrificial agent, the hydroxylation of phenol was almost terminated. After adding the hydroxyl radical sacrificial agent TBA into this photocatalytic system, the conversion of phenol decreased from ∼40% to ∼11% without producing CAT and HQ, indicating that ˙OH played a key role in the phenol hydroxylation process (Fig. S8†). The EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. 5B) confirmed that the NiFe-NS exhibited a considerably lower charge transfer resistance than NiFe-Bulk, which was beneficial to enhance the separation and transfer of photoinduced electron–hole pairs in the photocatalytic reaction. The higher conductivity could be due to the more abundant surface defects in the NiFe-NS.79 Consistently, the NiFe-NS provided a higher photocurrent density than NiFe-Bulk (Fig. 5C), suggesting that more electrons were generated in the NiFe-NS, as can be well understood for the ultrathin structure. Above all, these results indicated that the more abundant surface defects in the NiFe-NS promoted the separation and transfer of photoinduced carriers, resulting in that more electrons could be transferred from the NiFe-NS to H2O2 to generate ˙OH radicals to participate in the hydroxylation of phenol (Fig. 5D).

To better understand how the defects affect the electronic structure and then the photocatalytic ability of NiFe-LDH, DFT calculations were employed to understand the band structure of NiFe-LDH models. Defective NiFe-LDH doped with vacancies (VOH, VNi, and VFe) and defect-free NiFe-LDH were taken as structural models to represent the NiFe-NS and NiFe-Bulk, respectively (Fig. 6A and B). As vacancies were introduced, an exceptional defect level emerged in the middle of the bandgap (Fig. 6C and S18†). The defect level, which mainly consisted of the contribution from the unoccupied O 2p and Ni 3d orbitals (Fig. S18†), resulted in a narrower bandgap for the NiFe-NS than for NiFe-Bulk (Fig. 6D). This defect state was expected to improve the separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers, in accordance with the electrochemical tests mentioned above (Fig. 5B), and boosted the electron transfer from the NiFe-NS to H2O2, releasing ˙OH to react with phenol. Moreover, with the introduction of defects, the adsorption capacities of LDH toward H2O2 were enhanced. Compared to NiFe-Bulk (Fig. S19†), the H2O2 molecule tended to prefer to adsorb onto the surface VOH sites of the NiFe-NS (Fig. 6E and S20†). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 6F, the adsorption energy of H2O2 on the NiFe-NS (−0.724 eV) was higher than that on NiFe-Bulk (−0.084 eV). From the DFT calculation results, it was proved that the introduction of defects not only enhanced the interaction between the NiFe-NS and H2O2, but also promoted the photogenerated electron transfer to H2O2 to release ˙OH radicals and hydroxylate phenols to DHB, explaining the promotion of photocatalytic activity by defects.

Conclusions
In summary, NiFe-NS with rich surface defects have been successfully synthesized by a simple coprecipitation process and the efficient photocatalytic hydroxylation of phenol to DHB was achieved with 40% conversion of phenol and 99% selectivity of DHB even under irradiation with 550 nm. This work not only efficiently utilized the solar spectrum but also provided an economic and environmentally friendly approach to synthesize DHB. The abundant surface defects (especially VOH) enhanced the adsorption of H2O2 and facilitated the photogenerated electron–hole separation and transfer to promote the formation of ˙OH, endowing NiFe-NS with excellent photocatalytic activity for converting phenol to DHB. This work enriched the practical application of the defect engineering strategy in the photosynthesis of high value-added products and provided a promising pathway for the efficient one-step synthesis of DHB under mild reaction conditions.
