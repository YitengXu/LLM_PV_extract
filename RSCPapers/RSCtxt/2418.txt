The current energy crisis and inefficient water management place enormous stress on the sustainability of our society and environment. As such, the development of high-efficiency, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly materials which possess co-existing functionalities for applications ranging from energy capture to water treatment in one material, provides an opportunity to achieve sustainable development. As multifunctional materials, the layer-structured Magnèli titanium oxides with stoichiometry of TinO2n−1 (n ≥ 2) have been extensively studied in view of their potential for photocatalytic, thermoelectric and photothermal applications over the past few years. This group of materials occurs naturally as layered structures with planar oxygen defects, however, understanding of the correlation between the planar arrangements of the oxygen defects and various energy-related properties remains limited. Here, we demonstrate how the formation of layer structured TinO2n−1 with various planar oxygen defect arrangements correlates with the changes of their physical and chemical properties. The experimental results from inelastic neutron scattering analysis and electrical characterizations provide evidence that the planar oxygen defects are responsible for phonon scattering and exert a strong influence on their electrical conductivities. Manipulating these planar defects allows interconversion between different phases, which changes the interplay between electronic and phononic sub-systems. These manipulations potentially enable optimization of the corresponding physical properties of these materials such that they are rendered suitable for applications that require co-operative multifunctionality. More specifically, the experimental results demonstrate that the valence band positions and the onset potentials in the materials are raised, further enhancing their ability for catalysis of electrochemical reactions. This work also demonstrates the combinational effects of the thermoelectric and photothermal properties of these materials on their photocatalytic and electrochemical performance thereby providing a novel means of controlling the multi-response functionality of these materials for a variety of applications in different environments.

Broader context
Both energy and water security are essential for the sustainable development of human society. The interdependency of energy and water has resulted in the search for materials that can be used to generate portable water with low energy usage or, even better, generate energy whilst producing potable water. This work demonstrates that the layer structured Magnèli titanium oxides possess co-existing functionalities, which can be applied to both energy harvesting and water treatment using one material. More specifically, in this manuscript, the arrangement of planar defects in the layer structured Magnèli titanium oxides are correlated with their physical and chemical properties which are the key enablers for delivering the multifunctionality of these novel materials in energy harvesting and water treatment. This correspondence between molecular scale properties and application is explored here through an interdisciplinary investigation in physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering, chemical engineering and civil engineering.

Introduction
Energy and clean water are two essential factors for the sustainable development of human society. In general, a large amount of energy is used to treat water such that it can be used for drinking and other economic activities. Although they are interdependent, research and development relating to energy materials and water treatment have typically been considered as two different disciplines. This dichotomy has arisen, in part at least, because materials that have co-existing functionalities for energy conversion and water treatment are limited. Complex oxides have played an important role in developing next-generation advanced multifunctional devices for applications in catalysis, energy storage, microelectronics, photovoltaics, and many other areas. Through chemical doping, interfacial strain, nanotechnology, and crystallographic orientation, the subtle interactions among charge, spin, and orbital degrees-of-freedom can be fine-tuned to achieve new physical and chemical functionalities that cannot be achieved in conventional materials.1 However, such coupling also brings challenges in materials optimization. For example, the electronic and thermal properties of a material that govern its thermoelectric behavior are both intrinsically correlated with its chemical composition and crystal structure, meaning that improving one property is often compensated by another. More specifically, control of carrier concentration in thermoelectric materials is usually realized by elemental doping, which may reduce both the thermal and electronic conductivities of the materials with resultant negligible overall improvement in thermoelectric efficiency. In this case, modern technology for improving thermoelectric transport properties always requires a strategy that can optimally balance the influence of chemical and structural modifications on the electronic and phononic behaviors of the materials.1
Layer-structured materials such as thermoelectric PbTe and Bi2Te32 as well as NaxCoO2 and Ca3Co4O93 have long been studied for potential energy-related applications due to the possibility to separately control charge and phonon transport in different layers. In general, the layered materials can be divided into two categories: naturally occurring bulk layered materials, such as graphite and the layered cobalt oxides;4 and artificial layered superlattices, including Bi2Te3/Sb2Te35 and LaAlO3/SrTiO3.6 In the latter case, most of the artificial layer structured materials require complex methods of fabrications such as molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) or pulsed laser deposition (PLD), with the costs associated with these complex procedures potentially hindering their large scale commercial production. Naturally occurred layered materials are therefore an ideal alternative, however, most of these materials (such as graphite) do not show promising multifunctionality, which limits some of their applications.
As a transition metal oxide, titanium oxides have raised strong interest not only in the area of thermoelectrics, but also for other sustainable energy applications such as use in photovoltaics,7 optoelectronics,8 as well as use as photocatalysts.9–11 The most common TiO2 does not posses layered structure. However, partial removal of oxygen can lead to the formations of Magnèli phased titanium oxides12,13 [TinO2n−1 (n = 2, 3,…)], in which oxygen vacancies arrange naturally into planar arrays, thus making them to adopt layered structures. Hence the Magnèli phase is an ideal system to systematically investigate the defect-controlled electronic, thermal, optical and catalytic responses in a single material system.
Given these significant benefits of layered Magnèli phases, we envisage that further manipulation of the planar oxygen defects in the TinO2n−1 system could be achieved via structural/compositional engineering for different applications from energy conversion to water treatment. In this work, the particle size, microstrain, and defect levels of sub-stoichiometric Ti2O3 compounds are manipulated in a controlled fashion. This leads to phase transformations and densifications during the sintering process. We experimentally demonstrate that the introduction of defects and the existence of a Ti3O5 secondary phase significantly enhance the phonon scattering, resulting in excellent room temperature thermoelectric performance through optimizing the compositional ratio of Ti2O3, Ti3O5, and TixO. Importantly, we also show that sub-stoichiometric Ti2O3 performs differently in regard to solar absorption, oxygen evolution, and photocatalysis depending on its composition. By manipulating the planar oxygen defects, the solar-thermal, electrocatalytic, and photocatalytic properties of these materials can be optimized, opening an avenue to develop a device with a particular material system that possesses the multifunctionality required for applications ranging from energy conversion to water treatment.
Our results indicate that the intrinsic layer structures of TinO2n−1 (n = 2, 3,…) with different periodic oxygen defect arrangements can effectively modulate the behavior of, as well as interactions between, the electronic and phononic subsystems in TinO2n−1, thereby enabling the use of these materials for different applications. The heat that is generated from the intrinsic thermoelectric and photothermic effects provides the ability to control and enhance both the photo- and electrochemical catalytic performance of the material, thus enabling the harvesting of these multifunctionalities in a single material system.
Results and discussion
Oxygen dependence of planar defect arrangements in TinO2n−1
In addition to the parent rutile structure of TiO2, there are a series of homologous layered Magnèli structures, presented as TinO2n−1 (n = 2, 3,…) that exhibit periodically arranged planes of oxygen vacancies rather than randomly distributed point-defects. As a result, TinO2n−1 occurs naturally as layered structures. The interplay between oxygen concentrations and electrical properties of single crystal Ti3O5 (TiO1.67), Ti4O7 (TiO1.75), Ti5O9 (TiO1.8), and Ti6O11 (TiO1.83) has been reported previously and it was believed that electrical conductivities of the TinO2n−1 Magnèli phases gradually increase with the increase of oxygen deficiency. Similar to tetragonal (rutile) TiO2, rhombohedral Ti2O3 has also been reported to possess comparable multifunctionality. Ti2O3 has the highest concentration of oxygen vacancies amongst all the Magnèli phases (TinO2n−1) with both reasonably high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity. Similar studies on the correlation between oxygen content and electronic transport properties of titanium oxides have been described but the oxygen-concentration-related structural effects on phononic transport and its corresponding lattice thermal conductivity remain elusive. The evolution of layered structures of titanium oxides with a general formula of TinO2n−1 with respect to the reduction of oxygen in various titanium oxide phases is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 and their reported electrical and thermal properties14–20 are tabulated in Table S1 (ESI†). From Table S1 (ESI†), it is discernable that all the measured thermal conductivities of TinO2n−1 are lower than the parent structure of rutile (TiO2). However, within the same crystallographic system (n = 4, 5,…9), the increased layer thickness between two oxygen planar defects can also contribute to the reduction of phonon thermal conductivity, which we will further elaborate on in later sections by comparing our theoretically analysed phonon thermal conductivities with our experimental data. If the planes of oxygen defects only act as phonon scatterers but have no effect on the electrical properties, then it may lead to an enhancement in the ZT values of the Magnèli phases of titanium oxides without sacrificing the power factor. However, these planar oxygen defects also lead to the introduction of additional charge carriers in the Magnèli phases. Consequentially, the electrical conductivities for the layered Magnèli phases can be up to two orders of magnitudes higher than that of TiO2, implying that the carrier contribution to the thermal conductivities of layered Magnèli phases is also increased. This counteracts the reduction of lattice thermal conductivities originated from the planar defects. Such an increase of the electrical conductivity can be attributed to the colossal enhancement in ionic conductivity.21 The Magnèli phased TinO2n−1 is based on the parent rutile TiO2 structure that is made up of octahedra with a titanium atom in the center with the shared oxygens in the corner or edge (as shown in Fig. 2). When an O atom is removed from the octahedron, another O atom will move in to fill the O vacancy to complete the octahedron. This mechanism for the recovery of the octahedral O positions at the shear plane is consistent with the previously reported mechanism of Ti oxidation in SrTiO3.22 When the O atoms fully occupy the positions at the interface joining two neighboring octahedrons (as shown in Fig. 2), a displacement would occur towards the neighboring O atoms. The formation of a shear interface demonstrates that the vacancy hopping, and therefore the ionic conduction, preferentially occurs in the areas that are adjacent to the planar shear interface of the multilayer oxide materials.21

The d value represents the layer thickness, which is determined my measuring the distance between each interfaces/shear plane (the yellow lines). The number of Ti layers that are parallel to the oxygen defect planes in a structure is given by the value n in the chemical formula.

To understand the particle size effects on the sintering products of Ti2O3, the D50 values of the particle size (the median of size distribution) of the Ti2O3 precursor powders were manipulated by controlling the milling duration with D50 values of 17.02 μm, 7.73 μm, 6.22 μm, 4.52 μm, 3.05 μm corresponding to milling durations of 0 h, 0.5 h, 1 h, 3 h and 10 h. The X-ray diffractogram (XRD) of the as-fabricated Ti2O3 precursor powder shown in Fig. 3(a) can be indexed as the rhombohedral Ti2O3 phase. No secondary phase was detected from the sample with the finest particles within the resolution limit of the XRD instrument, demonstrating that no phase transformation occurred during the processing. From the titanium and oxygen phase diagram, we can see that the pristine Ti2O3 is thermodynamic stable at the temperature up to 1973 K. In this case, we focus on the as-milled materials and investigate their thermal stability, physical and chemical properties. The as-milled materials were subsequently sintered at 1473 K for 5 min using a SPS technique and labeled as sample A, B, C, and D, respectively. Their XRD diffractograms are shown in Fig. 3(b). In stark contrast, secondary Magnèli Ti3O5 phases, followed by trace amounts of Ti2O and TiO (which are labelled as TixO), can be clearly identified in the SPS-sintered samples with Ti2O3 remained as the main phase. The increased intensities of Ti3O5 XRD characteristic peaks, as well as the eventual appearance of the Ti2O peaks (Sample D) in the as-sintered samples indicate that more Ti3O5 and Ti2O are formed during the sintering process from Ti2O3 with higher microstrains induced by prolonged ball-milling.

Rietveld refinement was used to quantitatively analyze the crystal structures and phase compositions with the results listed in Table 1. As the microstrain increased, the content of Ti2O3 in the as-sintered materials gradually decreased from 71.6% to 47.8%, accompanied by an increase in the secondary phase contents of Ti3O5 and TixO. Referring to the actual composition of the as-sintered materials, we subsequently label our samples as (1) 71.6%Ti2O3–28.4%Ti3O5, (2) 70.3%Ti2O3–29.3%Ti3O5–0.5%TiO, (3) 62.7%Ti2O3–35.8%Ti3O5–1.5%TixO, and (4) 47.8%Ti2O3–48.3%Ti3O5–3.9%TixO, respectively. The occurrence of redox reactions during the SPS sintering has been reported previously for Na24Si13623 and Y3NbO7.24 The SPS study on Y3NbO7,24 further supports the notion that the phase formation during SPS was extremely sensitive to size, microstrain, and morphology of the initial materials. In this case, the presence of Ti3O5 and TixO in our as-sintered samples may be attributed to the partial decomposition of Ti2O3. Given that Ti2O3 and Ti3O5 are chemically stable from ambient temperature to 1973 K,25 which is significantly higher than our sintering temperature, it is believed that the mechanical grinding not only divided TinO2n−1 (n ≥ 2) into fine particles but also induced microstrain into the particles to reduce their energy barriers for phase transformations at a lower temperature.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were used to further characterize the structure of the 62.7%Ti2O3–35.8%Ti3O5–1.5%TixO composite. The HRTEM image of Fig. 4 clearly demonstrates the intrinsic layer structure of Ti2O3 along the [100] orientation. The inset in Fig. 4 shows that the measured layer thickness (d = 0.2571 nm) is almost identical to the theorectical value (d = 0.2592 nm) as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1, clearly supporting the existence of the oxygen defect planes.

Fig. 5 shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Ti in the as-sintered samples. In Fig. 5(a) and (b), the peaks with binding energy of 464.6 eV and 458.8 eV are attributed to Ti4+.26,27 Chemically, Ti2O3 and Ti3O5 can be considered as TiO2·TiO and 2TiO2·TiO, indicating that multiple charge states of Ti exist in the compound with the majority of Ti4+ in the sample where the XPS spectra verifying this notion. However, it is important to note that this does not suggest the existence of TiO2 in the sample, as this phase is not observed in the XRD patterns. The shoulder of the Ti 2p3/2 peak with binding energy 456.8 eV can be assigned to Ti3+.27Fig. 5(c–f) show the XPS spectra of freshly cleaved surfaces in Ti2O3 composites with four different compositions. After the sintering process, several new peaks with binding energies of 455.9 eV (Ti2+ 2p3/2) and 455.0 eV (Ti1+ 2p3/2) appear in all samples. The shoulder peak with binding energy of 453.9 eV can be assigned to the metallic Ti 2p3/2 state, but the signal is extremely weak compared to the others.28 Overall, the existence of lower valence Ti2+ 2p3/2, Ti1+ 2p3/2, and Ti 2p3/2 revealed from XPS analysis support our phase enumerations from the XRD refinement.

Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity

Fig. 6(a) shows that the Seebeck coefficients of all samples decrease with the increase of temperature. They are positive from room temperature to 650 K and become negative beyond this critical temperature, indicating that the charge carriers changed from holes to electrons at 650 K. This is in good agreement with the reported data of TiO1.4629 and the pristine Ti2O3 (TiO1.5).30 It also shows that the Seebeck coefficients on the as-processed TinO2n−1 do not exhibit strong dependency upon their chemical compositions. However, the electrical resistivity of 70.3%Ti2O3–29.3%Ti3O5–0.5%TiO decreased dramatically compared to that of 71.6%Ti2O3–28.4%Ti3O5 [Fig. 6(b)]. Importantly, a semiconductor-to-metal transition occurred in all samples around 450 K. The resistivity results in Fig. 6(c) show that the carrier mobilities and concentrations for all samples remain at the same order of magnitude at the measuring temperature around 370 K with the increase of the Ti3O5 content. It has been reported that the resistivity of TiO (1.8 × 10−5 Ω m)31 is much lower than that of Ti2O3 (1.4 × 10−4 Ω m).16 Compared to 71.6%Ti2O3–28.4%Ti3O5, the Hall mobility of the 70.3%Ti2O3–29.3%Ti3O5–0.5%TiO is almost doubled (from 0.68 to 1.25 cm2 V−1 s−1). Given that these two samples have almost the same content of Ti3O5, the measurement results indicate that the introduction of trace amount of TiO can effectively enhance the Hall mobility. The improved charge carrier mobility is mainly due to the reduced energy barrier for inter-grain carrier transport by the introduction of TiO nanodomains in the Ti2O3 matrix material, which has been recently observed in semiconductor–metal nanocomposites.32 On the other hand, the rearrangement of the planar oxygen defects have only marginal effects on the carrier concentrations, compared to the changes in Hall mobilities. The carrier concentration decreases with increasing the percentage of TiO and Ti2O, because these nanodomains injected electrons to the p-type Ti2O3 host, which annihilate the intrinsic hole carriers. Nevertheless, both types of carriers contribute to the total electrical conductivity, which was found to be increased with increasing secondary phase content, in consistent with the reported phenomena in other material systems.33,34 The optimal electrical conductivity of ∼122 S cm−1 is achieved in 62.7%Ti2O3–35.8%Ti3O5–1.5%TixO, with both reasonably high Hall mobility and charge carrier concentration, which are mainly contributed by the higher TiO and Ti2O concentrations. With smaller d-spacing (layer thickness between two planar oxygen defects, summarized in Fig. 1), the structure of Ti2O3 contains the highest density of planar defects, providing intrinsic transport channels for charge carriers. This is the reason why the Hall mobility of Ti2O3 single crystal is extremely high (∼9 cm2 V−1 s−1)35 compared to that of 71.6%Ti2O3–28.4%Ti3O5 (∼0.79 cm2 V−1 s−1). However, the excessively dispersed nanocomposites of secondary phases act as the scattering centers for carriers, further reducing the Hall mobility of the charge carriers in 47.8%Ti2O3–48.3%Ti3O5–3.9%TixO. For degenerate semiconductors and metals, the Seebeck coefficient can be calculated from Mott's formula as follows:36 (1)where kB, h, m*, and n are Boltzmann constant, Planck constant, effective mass, and carrier concentration, respectively. Based on eqn (1), the effective mass and concentration of the charge carriers are the two main material-dependent parameters in determining the Seebeck coefficient. In addition, the effects of phase transformation on carrier concentration of the TinO2n−1 system are limited, resulting in the small difference in the temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficient as shown in Fig. 6(a).

Phononic transport
With the understanding of Seebeck coefficients and electrical properties in the TinO2n−1 system, we applied laser flash photolysis, inelastic neutron scatterings (INS) and first-principle simulations to investigate how the lattice structures along with the oxygen defect arrangements influence the phonon (lattice) thermal conductivity of the TinO2n−1 system. Fig. 7 plots the as-measured total thermal conductivities (κ) and phonon thermal conductivities (κph) for all four Ti2O3-based samples, respectively. According to the Wiedemann–Franz law, the total thermal conductivity (κ) consists of contributions from both the phonon (κph) and charge carrier (κc) thermal conductivities (κ = κph + κc). Therefore, κph presented in Fig. 7(b) was determined by subtracting the as-measured κ with κc (κc= LT/ρ, where L, T, and ρ are Lorenz number 2.45 × 10−8 WΩ K−2, temperature and electrical resistivity, respectively). It is discernable from Fig. 7 that the charge carrier and phonon thermal conductivities played different roles in the total thermal conductivity. The phonon thermal conductivities dominated the total thermal conductivity at room temperature while the carrier thermal conductivity took over at higher temperature. This results in the reduction of the total and phonon thermal conductivities over the measurement temperature range with the trend of Ti2O3 > 71.6%Ti2O3–28.4%Ti3O5 > 47.8%Ti2O3–48.3%Ti3O5–3.9%TixO > 70.3%Ti2O3–29.3%Ti3O5–0.5%TiO > 62.7%Ti2O3–35.8%Ti3O5–1.5%TixO. Reduction in the lattice thermal conductivities can be attributed to the stronger vibrational anharmonicity in Ti3O5, the structural origins of which will be discussed in more detail in conjunctions with our theoretical analysis later. However, the total thermal conductivity of 47.8%Ti2O3–48.3%Ti3O5–3.9%TixO exhibits its highest value over 900 °C, which is related to the high carrier thermal conductivity in this particular sample.

Finally, the temperature-dependent figure-of-merit values for the TinO2n−1 hybrid system are plotted in Fig. 7(d). The ZT values first decrease and then increase slightly at temperatures beyond 650 K. The highest ZT value of ∼0.11 was achieved in 62.7%Ti2O3–35.8%Ti3O5–1.5%TixO around room temperature compared to ∼0.04 for the pristine Ti2O3 with this result demonstrating that the as-fabricated materials are more suitable for thermoelectric applications at room temperature and above compared to the pristine sample. As discussed, the strong suppression of phonon thermal conductivity in this sample, with minimum scarification of the electrical conductivity [Fig. 7(c)], play an important role in enhancing the ZT value in the as-prepared Ti2O3 hybrid material.

Fig. 8 shows the phonon density-of-states (PDOS) for three TinO2n−1 hybrid systems measured with inelastic neutron scattering. The theoretical calculated PDOS for three phases of bulk TiO2, Ti2O3, and Ti3O5 both at 0 K and elevated temperatures are also plotted in the corresponding figures for comparison. Fig. 8(a)–(c) clearly demonstrate that the as-measured PDOS spectra for all three mixed-phase samples are strongly dominated by the lattice vibrations of the Ti2O3 phase with three main vibration modes peaking at around 20, 40 and 60 meV, respectively. For the bulk Ti2O3, the simulated PDOS spectra reveal that the low (high)-energy ranges are dominated by the vibrations of Ti (O)-sublattices. The most noticeable change in the as-measured PDOS comes from the 47.8%Ti2O3–48.3%Ti3O5–3.9%TixO sample [Fig. 8(c)], with an increase of the PDOS intensities at an energy range between 50 to 60 meV. As the bulk Ti2O3 exhibits a phonon stop-band at this frequency range [Fig. 8(e)] while Ti3O5 does not [Fig. 8(f)], the increased PDOS intensity is mainly attributed to the increase of the Ti3O5 content in the 47.8%Ti2O3–48.3%Ti3O5–3.9%TixO sample.

The PDOS spectra for (g) Ti2O3 and (h) Ti3O5 at 200, 300 and 600 K obtained from AIMD simulations. 
With Ti2O3 being the dominant phase, all three INS PDOS spectra showed similar temperature-dependent variations: the peak at around ∼20 meV increases its intensity, whereas the peaks at 40 and 60 meV exhibit red-shifting and reduction of intensity in the as-measured PDOS. The shifting in PDOS position can be attributed to phonon anharmonicities in the material with this effect expected theoretically from both AIMD simulations and Grüneisen parameters for Ti2O3 and Ti3O5 obtained from harmonic lattice dynamics calculations.
By convoluting the velocity auto-correlation functions acquired from AIMD simulations, Fig. 8(g) and (h) plot the computed PDOS at different temperatures which qualitatively reveal similar PDOS trends probed by INS experiments. The prominent red-shifting of Ti2O3 PDOS groups at around 30–50 meV and 55–70 meV is distinctive [Fig. 8(g)]. The broadening of the PDOS spectra at around ∼60 meV for 47.8%Ti2O3–48.3%Ti3O5–3.9%TixO is consistent with the simulated PDOS for Ti3O5 shown in Fig. 8(c), which does not show phonon stopband at this frequency. This shows that the dynamic behavior of Ti3O5 modes only comes to play a more prominent role in 47.8%Ti2O3–48.3%Ti3O5–3.9%TixO. Phonons in this frequency range are predominantly contributed by the vibrations of oxygen sublattices (Fig. 8 and ESI†). From the perspective of chemical bonding as well as the AIMD result, the liberation of the oxygen vibration contributes strongly to phonon anharmonicities in sub-stoichiometric titanium oxides. Furthermore, since the AIMD simulations were performed under constant volume, the effects of thermal expansion on phonon activities were not considered. To overcome such a problem, we further investigated the anharmonic phonon behavior using the Grüneisen parameter. Under the harmonic approximation, the Grüneisen parameter describes the changes in vibrational phonon frequencies under a small volumetric change of the crystal unit cell:  where ω(q,λ) is the eigenfrequency for the λ-th normal mode at wave-vector q, and Ω is the unit cell volume. The mode-dependent Grüneisen parameters shown in Fig. 9(a) demonstrate that the low-frequency acoustic modes made the most significant contribution to phonon anharmonicities in the TinO2n−1 hybrid system. For Ti2O3, the acoustic modes possess both positive and negative Grüneisen parameters, whereas the Grüneisen parameters of Ti3O5 (as well as the parent rutile TiO2) are highly positive. This suggests that the modes contributing to blue- and red-shifts in the low-frequency range of the Ti2O3 vibrational spectra can cancel out their effects, leading to a less noticeable shifting in vibrational frequencies as temperature increases as shown in Fig. 8(a–c). It is only at the higher frequency ends (>30 meV) that temperature-dependent shifting in the Ti2O3 PDOS peak positions become more noticeable, due to the dominating contributions from positive Grüneisen parameters for Ti2O3.

As a consequence of the ubiquitous presence of large negative Grüneisen parameters for Ti2O3 at low vibrational frequencies (which cancel out the contributions from the positive Grüneisen parameters), the effective mode-dependent Grüneisen parameters, defined as  (with Cλ being the mode-dependent phonon heat capacity), are small. As a result, it leads to a significant increase in the phonon thermal conductivity compared to that of TiO2 as shown in Fig. 9(b). This is not the case with a further increase of oxygen vacancy concentration, which leads to the formation of the Ti3O5 phase. The strong anharmonic acoustic phonons lead to stronger suppression of lattice thermal conductivity in Ti3O5, making it smaller than that of rutile TiO2. Compare to the Ti2O3 structure, less of the planar oxygen exists in the Ti3O5 lattice, in which a larger d-spacing (Fig. 1) and a larger number of interstices occur around the Ti–O octahedron (see Fig. S1, ESI†). Vibrational modes with large Gruneisen parameters (hence are strongly scattered) appeared to be ‘breathing vibrations’ of the Ti–O lattice around these octahedral interstices. It can be seen from the vibrational eigenmodes that the presences of these interstices enable large-amplitude atomic vibrations and thus increases the vibration anharmonicity. Detailed examination of the vibrational eigenmodes shows that increase of the oxygen vacancy level makes Ti3O5 adopt a ‘framework’ type structure around oxygen vacancies. The highly anharmonic modes of Ti3O5 are attributed to the ‘breathing vibrations’ of these Ti–O octahedra around these interstitial spaces (see ESI†). This is believed to contribute to the strong reduction in the thermal conductivity of Ti3O5, which agrees with the inelastic neutron scattering analysis. The calculated results also indicate that, within the same crystallographic system (n = 4, 5, 6 and 7, see Fig. 1), the phonon thermal conductivity decreases as the d-spacing increases, which is in overall agreement with the data presented in Table S1 (ESI†). Our detailed theoretical analysis thus suggested that, while layer thickness is often applied heuristically to predict lattice thermal conductivity of layered structures, the exact structural contribution to the modification of lattice thermal conductivities can be more complex with computational modeling critical for revealing these origins.
Optical property and solar absorptions
Although the applications of TiO2 in photocatalysis and water treatment have been studied intensively, the understanding of the as-prepared Ti2O3-based hybrid system in these areas, however, is limited. The diffuse reflectance spectra of the as-prepared Ti2O3-based hybrid system is presented in Fig. 10 in the wavelength regime from ultraviolet to the near-infrared. As shown in Fig. 10, all the samples exhibit excellent absorption over the whole measurement range, especially in the visible range of 400–760 nm. The measured reflectance of the Ti2O3-based hybrid system is in a good agreement with that reported for bulk Ti2O37 and Ti2O3 nanoparticles.7,37 All the samples can be seen to possess similar reflectance features in Fig. 10 with the absorption efficiency in the visible range gradually decreasing with the increase of Ti3O5 and metallic TixO phases. Interestingly, 47.8%Ti2O3–48.3%Ti3O5–3.9%TixO shows the lowest absorption efficiency in the visible light range of 400–760 nm while the highest absorption occurs in the infrared range (>760 nm). This is probably caused by the increase in the amount of Ti3O5 phase present. It has been reported that the diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectra of Ti3O5–Mo (less than 10 wt%) exhibits an average absorption of ∼8% in both the UV-visible region (400–700 nm) and near-infrared range (700–800 nm). This differs from that of commercial Ti2O3 that has ∼92% absorbance in the 400–700 nm range and ∼85% in the near-infrared >700 nm, which represents the major contribution to solar absorption.38 Notably, the reflectance in the near-infrared region (>700 nm) for 47.8%Ti2O3–48.3%Ti3O5–3.9%TixO is lower than that of 62.7%Ti2O3–35.8%Ti3O5–1.5%TixO. This may be attributed to the increase of the Ti3O5 phase, which is believed to result in a lower reflectance (∼5–8%) in the infrared region.39 It was reported that Ti2O3 nanoparticles are efficient photothermal materials as a result of their excellent absorbance of solar irradiation.7 To understand the optical properties of the as-prepared TinO2n−1 hybrid system, the absorption capacity of the materials have been calculated with the data extracted from Fig. 10 and summarized in Table 2.40 The total absorption capacities of the as-prepared TinO2n−1 hybrid system are 86–89.2%, lower than that of the Ti2O3 nanoparticle (92.5%) over the whole range of the solar spectrum. Although the absorption capacities of the as-prepared Ti2O3-based hybrid system tend to decrease with the appearance of Ti3O5, it is noticeable that the comparison between our experimental data and the reported data of commercial Ti2O3 and Ti2O3 nanoparticles demonstrates that the Ti3O5 phase in 71.6%Ti2O3–28.4%Ti3O5 enhances the absorption of UV-visible light, probably due to its larger bandgap. Consequentially, this gives rise to the lower reflectance in both the visible (∼4–6%) and infrared regions (∼5–8%),39 which is believed to make the major contribution in high-performance photocatalysis and photothermal conversions.41,42

Catalytic performance
The oxidation of water, which generates highly reactive oxygen species (including the hydroxyl radical OH˙, singlet oxygen 1O2 and superoxide radical anion O2˙−), plays an important role in the mineralization of organic pollutants and inactivation of bacteria. Here, we investigate the performance of the as-prepared Ti2O3-based hybrid system for the photocatalytic oxidation of a model organic pollutant (i.e., formic acid). Generally, the photocatalytic performances of the TinO2n−1 hybrid system are governed by several underlying factors, with the most important being (1) surface defects, (2) light absorbance capacity, and (3) the phase content of Ti3O5 and metallic TixO.
Surface defects can significantly improve the e–h separation efficiency by acting as charge carrier traps, thereby facilitating the photocatalytic activity.43 The as-fabricated Ti2O3 hybrid system is composed of Ti3O5 and TixO nanoparticles within the Ti2O3 phase matrix. Increasing the amount of Ti3O5 and TixO nanoparticles are expected to create more surface defects, leading to the enhancement of catalytic activity. On the other hand, since a reduction in light absorbance capacity within the UV-vis range is observed as the Ti3O5 and TixO content increases in the sample, it can lead to a reduction in the amount of photo-activated oxygen being generated on the sample surfaces.44 Consequentially, this weakens the catalytic power for oxidative degradation of the pollutants. The absorption coefficients were extracted from the reflectance spectra according to the Tauc plot (as shown in Fig. S3, ESI†). The calculated bandgaps of 71.6%Ti2O3–28.4%Ti3O5, 70.3%Ti2O3–29.3%Ti3O5–0.5%TiO, 62.7%Ti2O3–35.8%Ti3O5–1.5%TixO and 47.8%Ti2O3–48.3%Ti3O5–3.9%TixO are 1.62 eV, 1.53 eV, 1.46 eV, and 1.36 eV, respectively, which are much smaller than the previously reported Ti3O5 based catalytic material (2.6 eV).38 The increase of metallic TixO phase content may further weaken its photocatalytic performance in view of its small bandgap.
Based on the discussions above, the photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared Ti2O3 systems are expected to be determined by the competition among these three determining factors.
The experimental results are presented in Fig. 11(a) and show that the carbon mineralization ratio reaches a peak when the 62.7%Ti2O3–35.8%Ti3O5–1.5%TixO sample is used as the catalyst and then slightly decreases with further increase in Ti3O5 and TixO contents due to the weaker light absorbance of these phases. In Table 3, we compare the materials-assisted photocatalytic decomposition of formic acid of our samples with that of other titanium oxide materials as described in the literature.45–48 Of these materials, pure TiO2 materials show relatively inactive catalysis with low mineralization rates.45,46 The Ti2O3-based hybrid materials are definitively better performing in this respect, however, while the treated or doped TiO2 materials demonstrate better catalytic efficiencies, such improvements are mainly due to the electronic and/or structural modifications to the host materials induced by dopants or surface decorations.45,47,48

For the other half reaction of the photocatalytic oxidation, the molecule O2 will first reduce to form superoxide radicals (˙O2−) followed by the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). As discussed in previous literature, superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide are reactive oxygen species that can be quantified using the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and permanganate methods, respectively.49 As superoxide reacts with NBT and H2O2 reacts with KMnO4, the remaining NBT and KMnO4 can be detected using UV-vis spectroscopy (i.e. pale yellow NBT at λ = 260 nm and purple KMnO4 at λ = 525 nm). However, these methods are not feasible to be used to detect the presence of superoxide and H2O2 during the formic acid degradation reaction due to interferences caused by formic acid. In the case of the NBT method, the UV absorbance of both formic acid and NBT occur between 200–280 nm, whereby the formic acid peak overlaps with the NBT peak and impedes effective analysis. For KMnO4, formic acid reacts directly with KMnO4 to form a brownish-red solution that prevents accurate quantification of the amount of KMnO4. Based on the above limitations, we instead conducted the reactive oxygen species tests in the absence of formic acid for the best-performing material 62.7%Ti2O3–35.8%Ti3O5–1.5%TixO. We understand that the reaction rate will be greatly reduced in the absence of formic acid as a hole scavenger although, interestingly, we were able to detect a small amount of superoxide over a 5 hour illumination period, as illustrated in Fig. 12 below. In contrast, no H2O2 was observed using the permanganate method. The results indirectly show that electrons in the conduction band are preferentially consumed for superoxide formation. While no H2O2 was detected during the irradiation, generation of H2O2 is still possible in the presence of a high concentration of superoxide.

Instead of using photon irradiation to generate electron–hole pairs for catalyzing chemical reactions, the Ti2O3 hybrid system can also be applied in an electrochemical based catalytic setting, given the unique bandgap, electrical conductivity and structural defects of these materials.50–55 Electrocatalysis in aqueous solution is centered around two half reactions: the anodic oxidation reactions (e.g., oxygen evolution reaction, OER: 4 OH− ↔ 2H2O + 2e− + O2) and the cathodic reduction reactions (e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction, HER: 2H2O + 2e− ↔ 2OH− + H2). For the reduction of water to produce hydrogen, Pt is the most commonly used cathodic material for water splitting.56–58 In contrast, anodic oxidation reactions, occurring at the surface of the anode, have unique functionality for the evolution of oxygen and generation of reactive oxygen species, which are responsible for the degradation of organic contaminants in complex waste streams.59 Hydroxyl radicals (OH˙) are produced via the oxidation of H2O (H2O → OH˙ + H+ + e−). This powerful oxidant will induce the non-selective degradation of contaminant organics at the anode surface.60 Recently, substoichiometric titanium oxides have emerged as promising anode materials for this purpose.61–65 This is because they can be cost-effectively fabricated into porous monolithic structures with outstanding ability to produce OH˙. Both electrochemical and photoelectrochemical studies suggest that the manipulation of oxygen defect arrangements in TinO2n−1 is an effective method to modify the optical and electronic properties of titanium oxides for electrocatalytic applications.59
Here, we used Ti2O3-based hybrid composites as anodic material to investigate its effects on the OER process. In Fig. 11(b), the OER activities of the TinO2n−1 hybrid systems have been characterized here using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The onset potentials of 71.6%Ti2O3–28.4%Ti3O5, 70.3%Ti2O3–29.3%Ti3O5–0.5%TiO, 62.7%Ti2O3–35.8%Ti3O5–1.5%TixO and 47.8%Ti2O3–48.3%Ti3O5–3.9%TixO are 2.32 V, 2.37 V, 2.41 V and 2.45 V, respectively. The potential values are positively shifted with the increase of Ti3O5 and TixO phases. The measured results are in good agreement with the standard electrode potential for OH˙ generation (H2O ↔ OH˙ + H+ + e−) (E° = 2.38 V).66 At the higher applied potentials (above 2.38 V), the formation of OH˙ will be strengthened, thereby facilitating the oxidation of aquatic pollutants.62,67,68 These results indicate that manipulating the degree of planar oxygen deficiencies in TinO2n−1 hybrid systems is a feasible approach to developing high-performance anode materials for water treatment applications.
The valence band positions of all the Ti2O3-based samples are experimentally determined from the valence region of ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS), demonstrated in Fig. S4 (ESI†), with all the band positions determined shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Based on the obtained bandgaps and valence band positions, the band positions for 62.7%Ti2O3–35.8%Ti3O5–1.5%TixO are shown in Fig. 13. As demonstrated, the VB position of 62.7%Ti2O3–35.8%Ti3O5–1.5%TixO provides a large driving force for the electrochemical formation of OH˙, because the VB holes have sufficient oxidation potential (2.83 V) to oxidize H2O into OH˙ (2.73 V).69

The demonstrated multifunctionalities existing in TinO2n−1 hybrid systems provide a unique opportunity to enhance their efficiency in energy conversion and water treatment processes. Through manipulating the arrangements of the planar oxygen defects, the composite materials could potentially be used in a multifunctional catalytic reactor powered by different energy sources (solar heat or light), depending on the environmental conditions. As a p-type thermoelectric anode, Ti2O3 benefits from its unique photothermic effect to boost the heat source from solar radiation to enhance its thermoelectric conversion efficiency. This directly facilitates the electrochemical catalytic process. Similarly, the photon radiation can also be converted into heat to assist the photocatalytic process. The temperature variations from the thermoelectric and photothermic effects provide new degrees of freedom to control and, potentially, enhance the performance of both photocatalytic and electrochemical processes.
Conclusions
In this work, we demonstrate the co-existing multi-functionalities of Ti2O3-based hybrid systems, from thermoelectric energy conversion to catalytic water treatment and solar absorption for photocatalysis, by manipulating the arrangement of planar oxygen defects. Our work indicates that the formation of intrinsic layered structural Ti2O3-based hybrid systems has different effects on the transport of charge carriers and phonons with the possibility of effectively tuning the subtle interplay among different physical properties for different applications. Through the manipulation of planar oxygen defect arrangements, Ti2O3-based hybrid systems can be optimized and, as a result, achieve superior performance with several different functionalities. In particular, the highest thermoelectric figure-of-merit of ∼0.11 was obtained in 62.7%Ti2O3–35.8%Ti3O5–1.5%TixO at 300 K by suppressing the phonon transport through partitioning the lattice vibration with the planar oxygen defect arrangement and enhancing the electrical conductivity with Ti phase. Subsequently, we characterized a series of other energy-related properties: the superior electrical conductivity of 1.2733 × 105 S m−1 in 47.8%Ti2O3–48.3%Ti3O5–3.9%TixO, the impressive total solar absorption of 89.2% in 71.6%Ti2O3–28.4%Ti3O5, and the best photocatalytic and electrochemical EAOP performance (onset potential: 2.45 V) in 62.7%Ti2O3–35.8%Ti3O5–1.5%TixO. These findings open new possibilities to realize the multifunctionality in one particular system for various applications. Moreover, the as-synthesized Ti2O3 hybrid systems can be used as a p-type thermoelectric anode, capitalizing on the advantages from both heat and photon radiation to facilitate the electrochemical catalytic and photocatalytic processes.
Experimental section
Sample preparation
Sub-stoichiometric Ti2O3 based ceramics were fabricated using commercial Ti2O3 (≥99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) powder, by applying high-energy ball milling followed by SPS densification. For the milling process, a zirconia milling jar (250 mL in volume) and balls (9.30 mm in diameter) were used in order to reduce the unexpected impurities. Basing on ball milling theories, for dry milling, a ball filling ratio of 0.3 leads to the most efficient grinding.70,71 The determined optimal milling condition corresponded with a ball-to-powder mass ratio of 5.7, with this ratio used for milling hours of 0.5, 1, 3, and 10 h in the planetary ball milling instrument (PM 400, Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany). The particle size of the precursor powder was determined using a Mastersizer 3000 (Malvern Instruments, UK). The ball-milled precursor was then introduced to a 20 mm graphite mold and pre-pressed under 50 MPa. The graphite foil was used to separate the mold and the powder. The graphite mold was then placed in the spark plasma sintering system (SPS, Fuji Electronic Industrial CO., Kawasaki, Japan). According to a phase analysis study on the titanium-oxygen system, the composition range of TiO1.4–1.7 could be obtained at a temperature of around 1423 K by using titanium metal and titanium dioxide as the starting material.12 To carry out the SPS procedure, the powder was heating at 1473 K for 5 minutes dwell under a uniaxial pressure of 50 MPa under vacuum (<10 Pa). Temperature measurements during the SPS procedure were carried out by a pyrometer on the surface of the graphite die. In order to minimize the thermal radiation, the graphite felt was used to wrap the mold during the sintering. The sample was polished to remove the graphite from the surface.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of all the samples were carried out before and after sintering by X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical Empyrean II, Malvern Panalytical B.V., EA Almelo, The Netherlands), with the 2θ range of 8°–100° scanned at intervals of 0.02°. The crystalline structures of the SPS processed samples were studied by high-resolution transmission electron microscope (JEM 2010F, Nanolab Technologies, Inc., CA, USA). The UPS valence spectra, valence states and the binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and O 1s core level were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
Structure refinement
Rietveld refinement was selected as the primary analytical method for this work to obtain the quantitative phase information and to quantify the crystallographic changes in the sample before and after SPS sintering. The Rietveld quantitative analysis was performed using PANalytical HighScore Plus (version 4.6a, Panalytical B.V., EA Almelo, The Netherlands). The first goal of this process was to determine which TinO2n−1 phases were present in the SPS sintered sample and the amount of the various phases. Measured patterns were matched by using the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) database with the following Powder Diffraction Data (PDF) cards utilized: 04-005-4632 (Ti2O3), 04-007-6635, 04-008-1596 (Ti3O5), 04-016-4319 (TiO), 04-005-4375, 04-007-2361 (Ti2O). The profile base width was set as 20, then the refinement process was initiated in automatic mode. The refined parameters during this process consist of the background polynomial, scale factor, lattice parameters, peak shape, and pattern parameters (U, V, and W). The pattern refinement (U, V, and W values) for each phase was repeated several times until the agreement index (Rexp, RBragg, Rwp, and GOF) became stable. To assess the accuracy of the quantitative analysis, 20 wt% Si (NIST 640c) was spiked into a 10 h ball-milled Ti2O3 precursor as a standard for phase percentage. The details of the refinement are summarized in Tables S2 and S3 (see ESI†).
Thermoelectric and neutron measurements
The electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient were measured simultaneously with a ZEM3 system (ULVAC Technologies Inc., Methuen, MA, USA) from 300 K to 973 K in a low-pressure helium atmosphere. The thermal conductivity was determined by using laser flash analysis (LFA-427, NETZSCH, Selb, Germany). For those measurements, the specific heat was measured and calculated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, STA-499F1 Jupiter, NETZSCH, Selb, Germany). Carrier concentration and mobility were determined from the AC Hall effect (8404 AC/DC Hall effect measurement system, Lake Shore Cryotronics Inc., Westerville, OH, USA) using the van der Pauw technique. Effective density was determined by gas pycnometer (AccuPyc II 1340 Pycnometer, Micrometrics, Norcross, GA, USA). Helium gas with ultra-high purity was employed during the measurement to eliminate the influence of open porosity. The final thermal conductivity was calculated from κ = αρCp, where α, ρ, and Cp represent thermal diffusivity, density, and specific heat, respectively. Measurements of phonon density-of-states (PDOS) were performed with the PELICAN time-of-flight neutron spectrometer in the energy-gain mode at ANSTO. Data for all the samples were collected at 200, 300, 500 and 650 K, respectively. All the measured spectra were normalized to a standard vanadium sample and corrected for the scattering from the empty scan.
Photocatalytic and electrochemical catalytic characterization
The optical properties, including the reflectance and solar absorption of the material, were characterized using a UV-vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer 950, PerkinElmer Inc., CT, USA) with a scan range of 380–1100 nm at an interval of 4 nm. The details of the instrument settings are specified in Table S4 in the ESI.†
For examination of the photocatalytic oxidation of formic acid, the catalyst mixture was prepared by adding 50 mg of catalyst to 50 mL of MilliQ water with 100 μmol of formic acid and sonicating for 15 minutes. The pH of the catalyst suspension was adjusted to 3.0 ± 0.05 with perchloric acid (0.5 M), and the suspension then added to a glass spiral reactor encircling a UV lamp (NEC, black light, 365 nm max emission). The oxidation of formic acid resulted in the production of carbon dioxide, detected by a Jenway 3540 probe. The presence of superoxide radicals (˙O2−) was identified using nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) colorimetric analysis. 2 mL of liquid sample from the photocatalytic reaction (filtered with a 0.22 μm nylon-membrane filter) was added into 2 mL of NBT solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 6 mg L−1) and 2 mL of water. The solution was mixed for 30 min for the superoxide to react with NBT. NBT absorbance was then measured at λ = 260 nm using a Shimadzu UV 3600 spectrophotometer. Similarly, 6 mL of liquid sample from the photocatalytic reaction (filtered with a 0.22 μm nylon-membrane filter) was mixed with 2 mL of 1 mM KMnO4 solution for H2O2 detection. The solution was allowed to react for 30 min before absorbance measurement at λ = 525 nm. Liquid samples were obtained before the reaction (0 h) and at 1 h, 3 h and 5 h reaction times for ˙O2− and H2O2 detection.
The electrocatalytic activity of the samples with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was characterized in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at room temperature using a three-electrode system with samples as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. For OER characterization of the samples, a constant scan rate of 10 mV s−1 was applied during linear scan voltammetry (LSV) using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 600E, CHI Instruments Inc., China).
Theoretical calculations
To better clarify the contributions from planar oxygen defects to the phonon thermal conductivities of titania, lattice thermal conductivities for TiO2, Ti2O3 and Ti3O5 were calculated via density-functional theory (DFT) simulations. For the phonon density-of-states calculations, the second-order harmonic force constants were calculated using a finite-displacement method, and the corrections to LO–TO phonon splitting due to long-range dipole–dipole interactions were corrected with a non-analytical correction term that depends on the Born effective charge tensors of the polar crystals. The lattice thermal conductivities can be calculated by solving the Boltzmann transport equation, with knowledge of the third order anharmonic force constants. Calculating the anharmonic force constants with finite-displacement methods, however, is computationally feasible only for TiO2, which requires 755 separate force calculations at DFT-level of theory (which increases rapidly to 18456 for Ti3O5 and more than 100000 for Ti2O3). Therefore, direct calculations of lattice thermal conductivities were achieved using the following ‘harmonic approximation’:  where  is the averaged atomic mass in the unit cell, δ3 is the averaged volume per-atom and n is the number of atoms in the unit cell. θD is the Debye temperature which can be calculated from the Debye frequency ωD for acoustic phonons as ωD = ℏωD/kB. Here ωD was estimated via a parabolic fit to the total phonon density-of-states up to 1/4 of the maximum phonon frequencies in the vibrational spectrum and was estimated to be 11.045, 12.706 and 9.7149 THz for TiO2, Ti2O3 and Ti2O5, respectively.  is the mode averaged Grüneisen parameter averaged over mode-dependent Grüneisen parameters (γλ) and heat capacities (Cλ). Under harmonic approximation,  measures the changes in phonon vibration frequencies as the unit cell volume shrinks/expands, and thus requires two extra lattice dynamic calculations at slightly contracted and expanded unit cells from the equilibrium structures, respectively.
All DFT calculations were performed with projector-augmented wave method as implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).72 Exchange–correlation interactions were approximated within the local density approximation (LDA) scheme. Both the lattice parameters and ionic positions were fully optimized prior to phonon calculations with dense k-points (18 × 18 × 27, 15 × 21 × 15, 15 × 21 × 18 for TiO2, Ti2O3 and Ti3O5, respectively). Gaussian smearing and a linear tetrahedron method with Blöch corrections were applied during geometry optimizations and force calculations, respectively. All structures were optimized with tight convergent criteria for total energies with energy cut-off of 500 eV.
Phonon properties were calculated using a finite-displacement method as implemented in PHONOPY interfaced with VASP.73 All force constants were calculated with a 2 × 2 × 2 unit cell with 3 × 3 × 3 k-point meshes. For non-analytical corrections to the LO–TO splittings, the Born effective charge tensors were calculated with dense k-point grids of 12 × 12 × 18, 15 × 21 × 15, 15 × 21 × 18 for TiO2, Ti2O3 and Ti3O5, respectively.

Ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations on Ti2O3 and Ti3O5 were performed with VASP using 2 × 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 × 2 supercells, respectively, with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional. The system was first equilibrated using the velocity scaling algorithm for 4 ps at 1 fs time-steps, followed by at least 16 ps of production runs in microcanonical ensemble with the thermodynamic temperature fluctuating around T. Phonon density-of-states were obtained by Fourier transforming the velocity autocorrelation function from AIMD simulation and broadened with a Gaussian profile of 5 meV in width.

Broader context
Both energy and water security are essential for the sustainable development of human society. The interdependency of energy and water has resulted in the search for materials that can be used to generate portable water with low energy usage or, even better, generate energy whilst producing potable water. This work demonstrates that the layer structured Magnèli titanium oxides possess co-existing functionalities, which can be applied to both energy harvesting and water treatment using one material. More specifically, in this manuscript, the arrangement of planar defects in the layer structured Magnèli titanium oxides are correlated with their physical and chemical properties which are the key enablers for delivering the multifunctionality of these novel materials in energy harvesting and water treatment. This correspondence between molecular scale properties and application is explored here through an interdisciplinary investigation in physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering, chemical engineering and civil engineering.
