    , Accepted 21st August 2018First published on 23rd August 2018AbstractIn this study, optical and structural characterizations of near-infrared-emitting alloyed CdSeTe quantum dots (QDs) are measured after the dissolution in toluene. Luminescence spectra are obtained from alloyed CdSeTe QDs under 800 nm femtosecond laser excitation. With increasing pump fluence, the line width or full width at half maximum (FWHM) of photoluminescence (PL) spectrum becomes larger than 10 nm due to increasing temperature. Ultrafast spectroscopic properties of CdSeTe QDs are investigated by means of time-resolved PL, transient absorption (TA) and Z scan techniques. Moreover, open-aperture (OA) Z scan measurement is used to clarify the composition and pump fluence dependence of optical nonlinearity under femtosecond laser excitation. With increasing pump fluence, evolution from saturable absorption to reverse saturable absorption in CdSeTe QDs is observed. The transition process is analyzed via a phenomenological model based on nonlinear absorption coefficient and saturation intensity, which indicates that CdSeTe QDs have potential for applications in all-optical switching devices.
1. Introduction
Over the past several decades, semiconductor colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) or quantum dots (QDs) have showed great promise for applications in fluorescence image displays,1 light-emitting diodes,2 and solar energy conversion3 owing to their unique photoelectric characteristics arising from quantum confinement. Some applications such as biological labelling of brain tumours prefer specific dot sizes to break through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and further prefer the emission wavelength to be in the red or near-infrared spectral band to avoid visible biofluorescence from organism multiplexing experiments.4 However, the size-dependent emission wavelength of conventional binary compound QDs usually falls in the entire visible spectrum rather than the near-infrared spectral range.5,6 One preferential solution to this challenge is to use alloyed or doped QDs since their emission can be manipulated by varying alloyed compositions when the size of QDs is fixed. Also, alloyed components in QDs may introduce new characteristics such as cubic-power dependence luminescence and longer exciton lifetimes in Cu-7 and Mn-doped8 QDs. One such system that has received considerable attention is II–VI alloyed QDs, and it is bandgap tailored by means of the ratio of the components; a complete understanding of the fundamental photophysical scenarios is of great importance.
The lattice constants of CdSe and CdTe are 6.05 Å and 6.43 Å, respectively,9 and they easily form alloyed CdSeTe QDs. Compared with bare CdTe and CdSe QDs, CdSeTe QDs are promising candidates for practical applications because the optical properties can be easily achieved by adjusting the constituent stoichiometry rather than tuning the size.10 CdSeTe QDs have larger band-gap spectral range and a wider emission peak in the near-infrared spectral region. The initial interests11,12 in CdSeTe QDs have been focused on the synthesis and optical properties of alloyed QDs. The study of Rogach et al.13,14 showed that luminescence lifetimes of CdSeTe QDs of the total intensity over the entire spectral range increased with the increase in the amount of Te dopant. The recombination of charge carriers trapped by Te impurities occurred on a slower time scale than that of bare CdSe QDs estimated at the position of the first absorption peak. Alloyed CdSeTe QDs were found to have conversion efficiency of ∼9.3% in solar cells as the main optoelectric conversion layer.15 The nonlinear optical properties of CdSexTe1−x QDs with near-infrared emission in the 700–750 nm range were studied using Z scan techniques with a tunable femtosecond laser system. The peak value of the two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-section was found to be ∼2400 GM at 1400 nm.16,17 However, there is no report on the change in FWHM of photoluminescence spectra of CdSeTe QDs in toluene excited by an ultrafast laser. The excitonic and trap-related dynamics of alloyed CdSeTe QDs in the strong confinement regime are not yet clearly investigated. With the change in the amount of alloyed elements, a detailed understanding of dynamic properties is essential for synthesizing appropriate alloyed QDs for applications in luminescence imaging and tumour detection.
In this study, composition-dependent ultrafast spectroscopic studies of near-infrared-emitting alloyed CdSeTe QDs are carried out using femtosecond time-resolved luminescence dynamics, transient absorption and Z scan techniques. With increasing pump fluence, FWHM of photoluminescence becomes larger than 10 nm due to increasing temperature. The spectral intensity is analyzed using Maxwell distribution.
2. Experimental sections
2.1 Synthesis and preparation
For the synthesis of CdSeTe QDs, CdO, Se powder, Te powder, oleic acid, trioctylphosphine, and octadecylene were separately added to a three-necked flask.18 The mixture was heated to 100 °C for one hour under vacuum. The reaction was heated to 180–260 °C at the rate of 10 °C min−1 and maintained for 20 minutes. The absorption and emission wavelengths of QDs were adjusted by the reaction temperature. A CdSeTe QD solution was obtained when it was cooled down to room temperature. Toluene and acetone were added to in situ turbid solution for precipitation by centrifugation. Afterwards, the CdSeTe QD solution was centrifuged at 6000 rpm to form a homogeneous dispersion and redissolved in toluene stored in refrigerator at 4 °C. The QDs dispersed in toluene were prepared by drop-casting onto low-scattering glass substrates to perform spectral and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Optically thin and transparent close-packed QDs were deposited on carbon-coated copper grids. High-resolution TEM measurement was performed on a Tecnai G220 S-Twin microscope operating at a high voltage of 200 kV. Five different samples with similar sizes were all dissolved in toluene at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1. All steady-state and time-resolved measurements were performed at room temperature, and samples were placed in sealed cuvettes to prevent oxidation of QDs.
2.2 Characterization
A femtosecond Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier (Coherent, Legend) produced 1 mJ, ∼120 fs laser pulses of 800 nm wavelength (1.55 eV) at 1 kHz repetition rate. A second harmonic generation crystal was used to double the photon energy of laser pulse to 3.10 eV after which a band-pass filter was used to block the residual laser beam at 1.55 eV. (1) Steady-state PL spectrum. The emission light and scattered light from the sample were collected by a spectrometer (iHR550, Horiba) and detected by a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. Laser pulses were focused on the sample to a spot size of 2 mm. (2) Nanosecond time-resolved luminescent dynamics. Time-resolved luminescence was measured on a spectrometer (PI instruments, SP-2500) with an intensified CCD detector (PI instruments, Max4-1024i). Instrument response time was 2 ns when the scattering light pulses were measured. (3) Transient absorption (TA) measurement. A pump beam at 400 nm was used for all TA measurements in this study. Laser pulses at 800 nm were focused on distilled water with thickness of about 2 mm to produce white supercontinuum light extending from 340 to 800 nm, which was used as the probe beam and reference beam to measure the TA signal. The chirp of white supercontinuum pulse was measured at the position of the sample cell using the optical Kerr effect of toluene and was used to correct the dispersion of relative delay time in the time-resolved data. The pump and probe beams overlapped on the sample spatially and temporally. The detection of probe pulses was done with and without pump pulse using a mechanical chopper at 500 Hz. Two highly sensitive spectrometers (Avantes, 950F) were used to collect the probe and reference beams for recording and calculating the TA dynamic traces. The relative delay between the pump and probe pulse was controlled with the help of a stepper motor-driven optical delay line (Zolix, TSA-200). A series of experiments were performed, and the pump fluence was changed using an energy attenuator. (4) OA Z scan measurement was used to clarify the composition and pump fluence dependence of optical nonlinearity under femtosecond laser excitation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Optical and structural characterization
The ground-state absorption and emission spectra of CdSeTe QDs were measured using a Vis-NIR spectrometer (TU-1901) and fluorimeter (Shimadzu, RF-5000), respectively. The absorption and PL spectra are shown in Fig. 1(a). The studies of Bailey et al.19 showed that the band gap of CdSexTe1−x QDs is not a linear function of the mole fractions of CdSe and CdTe, and it also does not lie within the range specified by the band gaps of the pure components; instead, it shifts toward lower energies. In homogeneously alloyed CdSexTe1−x QDs, the observed redshift was even larger when compared with that of core–shell CdTe–CdSe QDs of the same size or gradiently alloyed QDs richer in Te at the center and Se in the outer layers.16 The composition-dependent Stokes shift varied by more than 100 nm; the shift was observed because of the combined effects of confinement-enhanced electron–hole exchange energy, internal crystal fields, and shape anisotropy. The first excitonic absorption peaks of the QDs clearly shifted to longer wavelengths with decreasing Se/Te ratios. This value was too large to be assigned to direct excitonic recombination because the Stokes shift is at the most 100 meV for excitonic recombination.20 The large Stoke-shift emission was ascribed to defect-related recombination.21 To understand the nature of redshift emission and excited-state dynamics, time-resolved PL measurement was performed. Time-resolved luminescence dynamics has been widely applied to investigate nanocrystalline structures and excited-state dynamics. The average PL lifetimes of CdSeTe QDs increased with decreasing Se/Te molar ratio, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The measurement was performed at the peak emission wavelength to disregard the influence of size distribution of CdSeTe QDs. The decrease in Se/Te ratio was responsible for longer average PL lifetime, which was much longer than that of pure CdSe or CdTe QDs ranging from several nanoseconds up to tens of nanoseconds.19 It was interesting to see that the average PL lifetimes of CdSeTe QDs became longer from 23.4 to 51.7 ns with an increase in Te content. This observation was consistent with that of halide-composition-dependent perovskites exhibiting significant dependence of Kane energy on the halide, which was most probably the consequence of mixed s–p orbit character in the valence band of lead halide perovskites.22 Se/Te molar ratios of five CdSeTe QDs samples were changed from 1.52 (S679) to 0.31 (S822) using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (Agilent 725ES), as shown in Table 1. The Se/Te mole ratios in five QDs were not the same ratios used in the reaction mixtures. All the five samples were rich in Cd and did not exhibit stoichiometric ratios. The results clearly indicated that the Te content of QDs increased the emission wavelength from red to the near-infrared spectral region. The alloyed QDs exhibited large Stokes shift between the absorption edge and emission peak since absorption is determined by the (large) host band gap, whereas emission is due to defect states inside the bandgap.12,13,23 The longer component of the emission decay trace increased drastically with higher contribution in the case of alloyed QDs as compared to that for undoped QDs. This observation clearly suggested that in alloyed QDs, the defect states in QDs decreased drastically. As a result, we observed increments of average emission lifetime in alloyed QDs (Table 1). However, as the charge carrier (electron or hole) relaxation dynamics of CdSeTe QDs occurred at the subpicosecond time scale, the nanosecond time resolution was not enough to determine the excited state dynamics of charge carriers. The TEM images of four CdSeTe QDs presented in Fig. 1(c–f) show that QDs were spherical, sufficiently monodispersed, and well separated, with average size distributions of 4–6 nm evaluated by the Image Pro-Plus software. The PL quantum yield (PLQY) of CdSeTe QDs was determined according to literature procedures using rhodamine 6G in ethanol as a standard.24,25 The absorbance and PL intensities of samples were measured with the same apparatus parameters. With decreasing Se/Te ratio, the value of PLQY became smaller.

3.2 Steady-state PL spectra under femtosecond laser excitation
Power-dependent PL measurements under femtosecond laser excitation were performed on three CdSeTe QDs. With increase in pump fluence, asymmetric broadening of PL spectra for S822 as well as for S803 was observed in the high-energy tail region, as shown in Fig. 2(a). For S779, no clear spectral broadening was observed at pump fluence from 0.3 to 6.4 mJ cm−2. The high-energy tails of PL spectra for Si26 and PbS QDs27 were fitted with exponential decay to retrieve a temperature at a certain excitation power. Herein, assuming that the carriers have Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution over the whole CdSeTe QDs, one method of extracting carrier temperature from PL spectra is to fit the high-energy tail of PL spectra, which follows the exponential law with photon energy described as28 IPL(E) ∝ exp(−E/kBTeh)(1)where E is the photon energy, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and Teh is the steady-state carrier temperature. The band-to-band excitonic recombination of PL intensity can describe the product of the absorption coefficient of II–VI QDs and Maxwell distribution as (2) (3)where α(E) describes the energy-dependent absorption coefficient of CdSeTe QDs, which was introduced as a piecewise function divided into the above bandgap and subbandgap regions. The denominator 1 + exp((Eg − E)/Δ) originates from the sigmoidal form of the subbandgap absorption coefficient function, whereas Δ is used for describing the width of the subbandgap emission with finite spreading.29 The exponential term represents Maxwell–Boltzmann statistical distribution, describing the occupation probability at each energy level. The full spectrum Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution to the PL spectrum measured experimentally is presented in Fig. 2(a). As can be seen from the fitting results, very good agreement was achieved with this fitting method.

The wavelengths of emission peaks of S822 and S803 were longer than the femtosecond laser wavelength (800 nm). Spectral broadening was ascribed to strong absorption due to change in carrier temperature.30 For S779, upconversion luminescence (UCL) at 779 nm was observed due to TPA, which was confirmed by power-dependent PL intensity, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The different power-dependent trends of FWHM and intensity could be interpreted as one-photon absorption or TPA. For S803 and S822, normal luminescence occurred, but for S779, UCL existed due to longer laser excitation wavelength, which was 800 nm and longer than the emission and absorption peaks.
3.3 Transient absorption
To evaluate the composition dependence of photon bleaching for all CdSeTe QDs, TA spectra were measured for CdSeTe QDs under 400 nm femtosecond laser excitation, and pump-induced absorbance changes (ΔOD) were recorded across the spectral region from 450 to 750 nm. The recombination dynamic behavior has been explained though competition among exciton formation, radiative recombination from shallow and deep traps, and free carriers.31,32 The TA spectra recorded immediately after laser pulse excitation showed bleaching corresponding to excitonic transitions. The bleach features originating from state filling overlapped with their energy-shifted derivatives, arising from excited state energy level shifts.33 Qualitatively different TA dynamics were found when pump fluence was more than one exciton per NC, which was calculated in terms of absorption cross-section and Poisson distribution.34 Here, the pump fluence was controlled to generate the same number of excitons per particle at low excitation level, which corresponded to the average QD excitonic occupancy, 〈N〉, estimated based on the absorption cross-section (σ) and per-pulse fluence (j, photons per cm2): 〈N〉 = σj. Femtosecond TA spectra of CdSeTe QDs are shown in Fig. 3(a). The TA spectrum of S679 showed a clear bleach signal at 530 nm for 1Se–1S3/2 (1S) optical transitions. However, with increasing Te content, the optically weak transition 1Pe–1P3/2 (1P exciton) became prominent in the alloy structure,35,36 which was absent in S679. Fig. 3(b) represents the TA spectrum of CdSeTe QDs (S779), which consists of two negative absorption bands (bleach) peaking at 489 and 575 nm. Interestingly, in the case of S779, the bleach maxima at 489 and 575 nm were assigned to the state-filling transitions 1Se–1S3/2 (1S exciton) and 1Pe–1P3/2, respectively. With the decrease in Se/Te ratio, both of the corresponding photoinduced bleaching redshifted, which was consistent with the results of steady-state absorption spectra.

The energy levels of CdSeTe QDs became more confined due to decreasing Se/Te ratio. The excited electron delocalization increased the excited state lifetime of alloyed QDs and reduced the electron–hole overlap integral, resulting in slow electron–hole recombination.37 These spectra are shown in Fig. 4(a); when 〈N〉 = 3, the photoinduced bleaching maxima of CdSeTe QDs redshifted with decreasing Se/Te ratio. With increasing time, the electron–hole pairs recombined, which was observed as bleach recovery. The bleach recovery kinetics can serve as a probe for the charge recombination processes. To investigate the dynamics of charge carrier recombination, time-resolved normalized TA dynamics was assembled from the absorption difference spectra at the photo bleaching peak of each sample, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The recovery of photoinduced bleaching can be quantitatively described by the following rate equation according to different recombination mechanisms:38 dn(t)/dt = An(t) − Bn2(t) − Cn3(t)(4)Here, n(t) is the carrier density at pump–probe delay t; the coefficient A of the first-order term represents the recombination rate constant of a single exciton, and the last two coefficients B and C of eqn (4) trace the trion and biexciton recombinations, respectively.39 A trion is an exciton with an additional charge, which is a single electron (hole) interacting with a spin-singlet state of two holes (electrons).22,40 Here, we used numerical integration of eqn (4) to simultaneously model the kinetic traces for each sample. To constrain the fitting, only B and C were set as free fitting parameters. The first-order recombination rate constants of the samples were experimentally determined from luminescence dynamics with low pump fluence, the condition under which the first-order recombination was dominant. The average short lifetimes of decay were similar for all samples. A similar decrease in lifetime corresponding to increasing Se content was observed in CdSeS nanoparticles.41,42 Controlling these recombination processes will be integral in achieving the highest device performance. Toward this end, surface modification and doping are promising areas for further research. This increased contribution from the short lifetime component with decreasing Se/Te ratio showed that the addition of Te altered both the optical properties and exciton dynamics of CdSeTe QDs.43

Upon photoinduced excitation, the excitons separated into electrons and holes, and the recombination followed several pathways, as shown in Fig. 5. Photoinduced excitons relaxed to CBM of CdSe and subsequently recombined to generate radiative exciton emissions with long radiative lifetimes (τa) in the nanosecond timescale. The photoinduced charge phenomenon is often ascribed to Auger-assisted ionization44 and/or hot-carrier trapping from QDs,14,45 essentially creating a charged separated state with one charge on the QD surface and the other inside QD. Excitation of this charged separated state then leads to a trion state inside the QD related to τT. Photoinduced II–VI QDs usually result in negatively charged trions because the hole is more susceptible to surface trapping in this family of materials based on previous studies.46 In the other case, biexciton kinetics can be related to τB for which 〈N〉 is strong enough so that the contribution of biexciton is not negligible, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The ratio change of ions in the alloy resulted in changes in their atomic sizes and electronegativity values. It was believed that the relaxation of anion–cation bonds to their equilibrium positions led to local structural ordering and particularly large band gap reduction in CdSeTe-type semiconductor alloys.47

3.4 Third-order nonlinear absorption
To understand the composition and pump fluence dependence of nonlinear absorption and to analyze the influence of off-resonant and resonant excitations in CdSeTe QDs, OA Z scan measurements were obtained to reveal the nonlinear absorption mechanism. To validate the femtosecond OA Z scan experiment, we first measured the nonlinear absorption coefficients of carbon disulphide. We obtained β = 1.5 × 10−2 cm GW−1 at pump density I0 = 200 GW cm−2, which was consistent with the reported results.48 Thermal accumulation could be safely neglected due to the low repetition rate of laser excitation. The results for all five samples at different fluences are presented in Fig. 6. Generally, optical response of nanoparticles consists of both absorption and scattering, and the former plays a significant role in relatively small nanoparticles.

To utilize the theoretical model to analyze the nonlinear absorption process, a more general situation is considered here including both saturation intensity Is and absorption coefficient β. We combined the effects of saturable absorption (SA) and reverse saturable absorption (RSA), yielding the total absorption coefficient as follows: (5)Here, α0 is the linear absorption coefficient derived from Fig. 1(a); I and Is are laser intensity and saturation intensity, respectively, and β is the positive nonlinear absorption coefficient. The first term represents saturable absorption αSA(I), and the second term represents reverse saturable absorption αRSA(I). Then, the normalized transmission can be expressed as (6)where Leff is the effective optical path, and z is the displacement of the sample from the focal point. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the theoretical fittings for all five samples agree with the experimental data. The estimated values of saturation intensity and nonlinear absorption coefficient (β) are given in Table 2. We can see the evolution of signal shape of the OA Z scan of CdSeTe QDs under different laser fluences. When the sample was far from the focus, linear absorption dominated without any nonlinearity. Hence, the transmittance reached the maximum of unity. As the sample moved towards the focus, the moderate intensity induced increase in the population of carriers due to nonlinear absorption.

For off-resonant excitation, RSA occurred under higher ultrafast laser excitations at 100–400 GW cm−2 because the energy bandgaps and band-edge emissions of the first three samples were larger than 1.55 eV; hence, TPA was observed. Under lower laser excitation, no clear SA was observed.49 For resonant excitation, at low laser intensities, SA occurred because their energy bandgaps were near the laser photon energy. Unlike the result for CdSeTe QDs embedded in a glass matrix,50 large SA was observed at relatively low fluences. At low laser intensity, as the sample moved towards the focus, the electrons in the valence band were excited to the conduction band and thus, the majority of nanoparticles were pumped to the excited state, leading to smaller population in the ground state. At this intensity level, the transmitted intensity was maximum, which resulted in SA behavior.51,52 Carriers were first pumped from the ground state to the excited state, where they then became free carriers. This process was subsequently followed by broadband absorption of these free carriers. Then, the excited electrons relaxed to the ground state by electron–electron coupling, electron–phonon interaction and phonon–phonon relaxation. At low pump fluence, for resonant excitation, the OA Z scan showed clear SA. When the sample was far from the focal point, transmission through the sample was low due to strong linear absorption. As the intensity increased near the focal point, the population of electrons saturated the conduction band, thus blocking further excitation in the valence band. Hence, transmission through the sample increased. This was one of the phenomena responsible for passive mode locking in lasers. Due to such reverse saturation and saturation absorption, CdSeTe QDs are ideal candidates for optical limiting and all-optical logic gate applications. The majority of QDs were pumped to the excited state, leading to less population in the ground state. This caused bleaching in the ground-state absorption band. Furthermore, when pump intensities increased to tens of GW/cm2, the combination of SA and RSA with opposite signs was observed.49 The strong excited-state carrier absorption resulted in clear dip in transmission signals near the focal point. With higher laser intensity, the dip dragged the transmission signals towards unity. These results indicated that RSA only occurred at extremely high carrier intensities, but its effect may totally offset the SA effect with sufficiently high laser intensity.
4. Conclusions
In summary, optical and structural characterizations of near-infrared-emitting CdSeTe-alloyed QDs were measured after dissolution in toluene. The optical properties of the dots were controlled by the Se/Te ratio. PL spectra were obtained from CdSeTe QDs with 800 nm femtosecond laser excitation. With increase in pump fluence, FWHM of PL became larger by about 10 nm due to increasing temperature. Ultrafast spectroscopic properties of CdSeTe QDs were investigated by means of time-resolved PL, TA and Z scan techniques. The results of time-resolved PL showed that the average PL lifetimes of five CdSeTe QDs became longer from 23.4 to 51.7 ns with the increase in Te content. TA spectra under 400 nm femtosecond laser excitation showed that there existed three kinds of excitons in CdSeTe QDs, and an exploratory model was put forward. OA Z scan measurement was used to clarify the composition and pump fluence dependence of optical nonlinearity under femtosecond laser excitation. With increasing laser power, evolution from SA to RSA in CdSeTe QDs was observed. The transition process was analyzed via a phenomenological model based on nonlinear absorption coefficient and saturation intensity. These results indicate that CdSeTe QDs are promising materials for potential applications in bioimaging and all-optical switching devices.
