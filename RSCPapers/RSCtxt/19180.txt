1. Introduction
Antibiotics have been extensively applied in diverse industries, including human health, livestock, and aquaculture, since Sir Alexander Fleming's discovery in 1928.1 Nevertheless, the environmental risk of antibiotics emerges after their entry into ecosystems through inevitable discharge.2,3 Although the detected environmental levels of antibiotics in aquatic systems are low (from ng L−1 to μg L−1), they are deemed “pseudo-persistent” pollutants owing to their continual introduction into waters and permanent presence.4 Currently, antibiotics have been detected in various environmental matrices, such as soil, groundwater and surface water.5,6 Moreover, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) driven by antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) are progressively increasing with the abuse of antibiotics, which mutually results in the severe spread of antibiotic resistance.7 Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are essential sources of antibiotics because the antibiotics cannot be eliminated owing to the limitations of the biological wastewater treatment processes.8–10
For this purpose, advanced oxidation processes, which are capable of effectively destructing bacterial cells, are powerful supplements for the advanced treatment of effluents of WWTPs.11–13 Various chemical oxidants, e.g., hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), peroxymonosulfate (PMS), peroxydisulfate (PDS), peracetic acid (PAA), permanganates, ferrates, and periodates (PI), are potential alternatives for AOP applications.14–17 Specifically, as attractive alternatives to traditional metal-based catalysts, metal-free catalysts (e.g., activated carbon (AC), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene-based materials, nanodiamond (ND), porous carbon (PC), biochar (BC), g-C3N4, and covalent organic frameworks (COFs)) show a promising future to initiate the oxidation reactions by activating chemical oxidants.18–20 More importantly, the design and fabrication of metal-free catalysts fit better within the sustainability concept than non-renewable metal resources.
Notably, several insightful review articles were published focusing on the degradation of antibiotics and ARGs by chemical oxidation processes before this submission. For example, Baaloudj et al.21 revealed the relationship between antibiotics, photocatalysis, and microbial contaminants. Furthermore, Ezeuko et al.22 summarized the applications of metallic nanoparticles to remove ARB and ARGs. However, a systematic review comprehensively discussing metal-free catalyzed AOPs for eliminating and inactivating antibiotics, ARB and ARGs is still lacking. Hence, this review aims to provide a timely overview of the metal-free catalyzed AOPs for wastewater purification. Special attention is paid to eliminating and inactivating antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs. Firstly, the commonly used metal-free catalysts (e.g., carbon-based catalysts, g-C3N4, and boron) are briefly summarized. Then, various metal-free catalyzed AOPs (e.g., H2O2-based AOPs, persulfate (PS)-based AOPs, and other AOPs) are comprehensively discussed for contaminant removal. Subsequently, the activation mechanisms (radical and non-radical) of metal-free catalyzed AOPs are critically reviewed. In addition, the degradation of antibiotics by metal-free catalyzed AOPs is analyzed. Notably, special attention is paid to the inactivation and reduction of ARB and ARGs by metal-free catalyzed AOPs. Ultimately, the current challenges and future perspectives of metal-free catalyzed AOPs toward pollutant elimination are proposed.
2. Metal-free catalysts
Metal-free catalysts (e.g., AC, CNTs, ND, BC, PC, COFs, boron, g-C3N4, and graphene-based materials) have emerged as rising stars in AOPs for green remediation (Fig. 1).23–25 In recent decades, the metal-free catalyzed AOPs have caused a research upsurge due to their unique advantages, such as environmental friendliness, minimized operational cost, and flexible and adjustable running processes.26–28 Nevertheless, although metal-free catalysts can avoid secondary pollution to a great extent, they usually suffer from inherent chemical inertness. Therefore, significant efforts have been made to improve the catalytic activity of metal-free catalysts through diverse modification methods.
 Fig. 1  The commonly used metal-free catalysts and oxidants for pollutant removal. 
To reveal the research history and the direction, a comprehensive literature stoichiometric analysis was conducted. By using “Advanced Oxidation Processes” as the keywords, we obtained a total of 28236 items from the “Web of Science” database. Since most of the items were published after 1994, a total of 24119 items were taken into consideration. To unveil the transfer of the research interest since 1994, especially in the past 5 years, the research timeline was divided into 2 periods, i.e., 1994–2017 and 2018–2022 (Fig. 2). The number of the published items revealed that AOP related research is currently a hotspot worldwide. Specifically, over 13246 research items were documented in the last 5 years, far exceeding those in the previous 23 years (1994–2017). In order to unveil the change in the popularity in different research fields, we further categorized the research items into 12 subject fields, e.g., engineering, environmental sciences and ecology, chemistry, etc. For assistance with the comparison, the ratio of the number of publications in each research field was divided by the total number of publications in the selected period, which is presented as the diameter of the circle in Fig. 2. As clearly indicated, the majority of publications focused on the “Engineering,” “Environmental Science and Ecology,” and “Chemistry” fields, showing the promising future of AOPs in these fields.
 Fig. 2  Evolution of subject areas related to AOPs during 1994–2017 and 2018 onwards. 
More specifically, co-word analysis obtained by VOSviewer was employed to analyze the development trend of AOPs in the last decade. As depicted in Fig. 3a, it was obvious that AOPs were closely associated with water purification. Notably, special attention was paid to the inactivation of bacteria by AOPs after 2018, and some new AOPs (e.g., PMS-based AOPs and PDS-based AOPs) developed vigorously from 2020 to 2022. In addition, some metal-free catalysts (e.g., rGO and boron-doped ND) were designed and prepared, which could serve as promising alternatives to traditional metal-based catalysts.
 Fig. 3  The development of AOPs in the last decade (a) and the technical evolution of carbon-based AOPs for water decontamination (b).29–44 
We also summarized the development and technical evolution of metal-free catalyzed AOPs for water decontamination. Some of the most important discoveries are given in Fig. 3b. For example, Masaru et al.29 discovered the activated carbon radical (AC˙) and proposed a novel oxidation reaction comprising the AC/AC˙ cycle as the catalyst at 1994. Jans et al.44 found that AC and carbon black could catalyze the transformation of aqueous O3 into ˙OH. In addition to AC, other carbonaceous catalysts (e.g., BC, CNTs and rGO) were also applied in AOPs. Fang et al.40 first demonstrated that persistent free radicals in BC were beneficial for the activation of H2O2. Similarly, Fang et al.41 found that the concentration and type of the persistent free radicals played critical roles in PS activation. These findings provided invaluable insights into the mechanisms of carbon-based AOPs. Additionally, some new oxidants (e.g., PI and PAA) were also involved in AOPs to address the challenges posed by complex and refractory wastewater.
2.1. Carbon-based catalysts
Carbon-based catalysts, such as AC, CNTs, graphene, and its derivatives, ND, BC, and PC, show excellent possibilities in AOPs owing to their unique advantages compared with metal-based catalysts (Table 1).

There are dozens of contributions published on the topic of carbon catalyzed AOPs. As a consequence, we only briefly summarize some recent advances here without focusing on the preparation methods of carbocatalysts and their properties. For more information, the readers are recommended to refer to the following representative publications: Yu et al.,50 Duan et al.,51 Liu et al.,52 and Wang et al.20

2.1.1. Activated carbon. 
Kimura et al.29 reported that the abundant oxygen functional groups endowed AC electron-transfer capability and thus could decompose H2O2 into ˙OH through a special electron-transfer regime. Inspired by this study, Liang et al.55 expanded the conclusion and confirmed that AC could decompose PS (the H atom was substituted with the SO3 moiety) into SO4˙−via the following reactions: S2O82− + AC surface − OOH → SO4˙− + HSO4− + AC surface − OO˙(1) S2O82− + AC surface − OH → SO4˙− + HSO4− + AC surface − O˙(2)
The generated ROS with higher redox potential than their parent oxidants could effectively oxidize the pollutants (Table 2). For instance, Liang et al.53 investigated the mechanisms of AC for PS activation towards sulfamethoxazole degradation (Fig. 4a). The results demonstrated that sulfamethoxazole could be effectively degraded by AC activated PS. Both SO4˙− and ˙OH were deemed to be the contributing species based on the EPR results. Likewise, Pham et al.54 used GAC for acetaminophen degradation by activating PS (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, though GAC exhibited more surface functional groups and larger surface area, the mass-based pseudo-first-order reaction rate constant of the CNTs (1.5 min−1 g−1) was 50 times higher than that of the GAC (0.03 min−1 g−1), which might be due to the dominance of sp2 and abundant CO groups in CNTs. Owing to the different surface chemistry, the radical pathway dominated the GAC-catalyzed process, whereas nonradicals played vital roles in the CNT-catalyzed process. The ˙OH was determined to be the dominant species for the oxidation of acetaminophen based on the mechanistic analysis. Except ˙OH and SO4˙−, other radicals, such as iodate radicals (IO3˙) and CH3C(O)O˙, could also be generated in AC catalyzed AOPs. Li et al.43 investigated the decolorization of acid orange 7 by GAC activated periodate (IO4−), and a remarkable synergistic effect was observed. Zhou et al.37 demonstrated that AC fibers could catalyze PAA decomposition with CH3C(O)O˙ and ˙OH formation. The bond distance of O–OH was significantly elongated (from 1.5214 to 1.5516 Å) with the assistance of AC fibers, favoring the homolysis of PAA (Fig. 4c).

2.1.2. Carbon nanotubes. 
Shao et al.57 successfully demonstrated that CNTs could effectively activate PMS for the oxidative elimination of organic micropollutants. The double vacancy defects on CNTs could serve as the active centers for the electron transfer-dominated nonradical mechanism (Fig. 5a). As depicted in Fig. 5b, electrons were more likely to accumulate in the double-vacancy defects on defective CNTs according to the valence-electron density map, whereas the valence electrons were distributed on the intact CNT surface uniformly (Fig. 5c). The asymmetric distribution of electrons indicated that the electrons at double vacancy (an expressway) were more favorable for redox reactions. Moreover, the electron density difference diagrams (Fig. 5d and e) showed that defective CNTs had a higher electron transfer potential than the intact CNTs. According to the Mulliken population analysis, the number of electrons transferred from defective CNTs to PMS (0.463 e) was much larger than that of the intact CNTs (0.265 e), confirming that the CNTs with unique double-vacancy defects could readily improve the electron transfer from 4-chlorophenol to PMS. Benefiting from such an unparalleled regime, the CNTs/PMS process obtained remarkable selectivity and realized the target-oriented removal of specific organic micropollutants. In addition, Wang et al.58 proposed that abundant free reactive Mn species could be produced in the ultrasound-assisted CNTs/permanganate system. CNTs could not only effectively accumulate the Mn compounds and pollutants, but also work as an excellent conductive medium for the electron-transfer process (Fig. 5f).

2.1.3. Graphene-based catalysts. 
For the first time, Lyu et al.59 indicated the formation of the double reaction centers on the C–O–C bridge in the 4-phenoxyphenol-functionalized rGO nanosheets, that is, H2O2 could be successfully reduced to ˙OH on the electron-rich center around O. At the same time, the electrons could be captured from the adsorbed contaminants on the electron-poor center around C (Fig. 6a). Benefiting from the double reaction centers, the H2O2 utilization efficiency was relatively high (>76% within 30 min). Similarly, Sun et al.33 discovered that the rGO could efficiently activate PMS with the yield of SO4˙− (Fig. 6b). The removal efficiencies of phenolic pollutants and methylene blue were even higher than those in the Co3O4/PMS system. Heteroatom doping could further boost the reactivity of graphene by regulating the electronic structure. For example, the kapp of BPA with N-doped rGO/PMS was 0.71 min−1, which was nearly 700 times that by the rGO/PMS process (0.001 min−1).62 For the first time, Long et al.60 used N-doped rGO with abundant atomically dispersed Co sites for PI activation. The Co–N coordination site was the active site for the catalytic oxidation reaction and significant electron transfer was verified between the PI and Co centers by the charge density analysis (Fig. 6c and d for CoN4 and Fig. 6e and f for CoN2O2), which reflected the formation of PI* complexes. In a recent study, a novel 3D rGO was prepared (Fig. 6g), which was capable of oxidizing phenolic compounds selectively by activating PDS.61 A positive correlation was observed between the hydrophobicity of phenolic compounds and the reaction kinetics, meaning that the oxidation behavior was affected by the hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature.

2.1.4. Nanodiamond. 
sp3 Diamonds could readily mediate photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, whereas sp2/sp3 hybrid and sp2 carbons were preferentially responsible for other catalytic reactions (e.g., oxidative dehydrogenation, AOPs, and selective oxidation/reduction).45 ND exhibited poor catalytic performance for PS activation because of its sp3-hybridized nucleus. Nevertheless, sp3 diamond could be readily transferred to an sp2-hybridized carbon structure through robust thermal treatment (Fig. 7a). For the first time, Duan et al.63 fabricated the annealed ND under 1000 °C for PS activation. Due to the intricate interactions of sp2 and sp3 interfaces, electrons could easily migrate from the ND core to the shell surface, boosting the cleavage of O–O of PS (Fig. 7b). In addition, the graphitized ND was even superior to other benchmark carbon catalysts (e.g., CNTs, fullerene, and graphene) for PS activation.64

2.1.5. Porous carbon. 
PC could be derived from diverse precursors, such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),69 COFs,70 and plant and animal residues.71 Owing to their large surface area, adjustable pore structures and superior electrical conductivity, PC was a competitive candidate for the AOP applications.72 Compared with carbon, PC possessed better adsorption affinity towards organics via hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen-binding, and π–π conjugation. Yang et al.65 prepared PC with an extremely high surface area (>4500 m2 g−1), exhibiting excellent adsorption capacity towards phenol (Fig. 8a). By coupling with PMS, this PC rapidly oxidized phenol with a kapp of 0.622 min−1, outperforming metallic catalysts (e.g., Fe2+, Co2+, and Ag+). Acid etching could effectively regulate the morphology of PC. As depicted in Fig. 8b, polytetrafluoroethylene was used as an additive to prepare highly porous carbon. The in situ generated hydrofluoric acid (HF) could etch out inherent silica components and enlarge the porous structure.66 This strategy avoided using hazardous chemical agents (e.g., HF, NaOH, and KOH) and simplified the preparation procedures. In addition, the prepared PC had a large surface area (2051 m2 g−1), which was about 20 times that of the rice husk derived carbon. Similarly, Kim et al.67 selectively etched the center of zeolite imidazolate framework-8 to obtain a hollow carbon (Fig. 8c). The hollow carbon was subsequently optimized by KOH activation to create more nanopores. Chu et al.68 demonstrated that there was a synergistic action between adsorption and catalytic reactions in a PC-catalyzed PS system (Fig. 8d). The electron transfer capacity of the substituted groups of aromatic pollutants was crucial for the degradation reaction. Notably, the electron transfer capacity could be reflected by the Hammett constant, and the order was nitro groups (+0.78) < chlorine (+0.22) < hydroxyl (−0.38).73,74 Therefore, hydroxyl groups could serve as the electron donors, which were beneficial for electron transport from contaminants to oxidants. In contrast, chlorine and nitro groups were electron acceptors, and could not promote electron transfer. In recent years, heteroatom-doping, especially N doping, was deemed a fascinating technology to boost the catalytic properties of PC. Both radical and nonradical regimes participated in the oxidation reaction, in which sp2-hybridized C and N active sites played crucial roles in the nonradical pathway.68 Ascribed to N dopants and well-developed pore structures, PC possessed more active sites for oxidant and pollutant adsorption. Thus, the oxidants could be activated by some active sites through the radical regime to produce free radicals, while other active sites might integrate with oxidants via a nonradical pathway to form metastable active intermediates. Overall, the type of adsorption between peroxides and PC determined the main reaction mechanism. However, researches on PC to reveal the reaction mechanism in AOPs were still at an initial stage, which needed more solid evidence to verify the mechanisms in the future.

2.1.6. Biochar. 
BC has been successfully coupled with several oxidants (e.g., PS, H2O2, PI, ferrate, and potassium permanganate) for contaminant elimination (Table 3). As depicted in Fig. 9a, Zhou et al.75 prepared BC from swine bone for PS activation to degrade acetaminophen. Both radical and non-radical pathways participated in this oxidation process, and the catalytic activity of BC climbed with increasing pyrolysis temperature (0.1042 to 0.4364 min−1, from 700 to 900 °C). In another study, Sun et al.76 investigated the removal of sulfonamide antibiotics from the synthetic urine matrix by BC and BC/H2O2 (Fig. 9b). The results demonstrated that sulfonamide antibiotics could be degraded in the urine matrix except for N4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole, and the carbonate radical generated by the peroxymonocarbonate activation was deemed the dominant ROS in the BC/H2O2 system. Xiao et al.42 revealed that BC fabricated from anaerobic sewage sludge could effectively activate PI to realize the degradation of organic acid II (Fig. 9c). Notably, both graphitic N and pyrrolic N improved the PI adsorption due to the electrostatic interactions, whereas carbonyl groups might not be suitable for PI adsorption, as evidenced by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 9d–f). Based on the characterization, scavenging experiments, and DFT calculations, 1O2 and electron transfer mechanisms were the main contributors to the oxidation process. Tian et al.77 investigated the ferrate activation by using eleven commercial BC, and three of them could significantly enhance the oxidation of sulfamethoxazole (Fig. 9g). With the assistance of BC, the oxidation rates of five organic pollutants increased by 3–14 times, and the total organic carbon (TOC) removal ratio increased by 2.4–8 times, respectively.77 According to the quenching experiment, EPR analysis, and oxidation experiment of the chemical probe, the formed intermediate iron species (FeIV and FeV) rather than radicals participated in the oxidation reactions. In addition, BC also showed an unexpected synergistic effect with KMnO4 (Fig. 9h).78 The results demonstrated that sulfamethoxazole could not be effectively degraded by KMnO4 alone, and the adsorption efficiency of BC for sulfamethoxazole was inferior (<11%). Nevertheless, an enhanced sulfamethoxazole removal (97% in 30 min) was observed in the BC/KMnO4 system, implying the synergistic effect between KMnO4 and BC.

2.2. Other metal-free catalysts

2.2.1. g-C3N4. 
In addition to the abovementioned materials, g-C3N4 has recently attracted increasing attention in AOPs due to its easy fabrication, negligible toxicity, and subtle electron properties.97,98 As a nonmetallic semiconductor, g-C3N4 possessed a narrow bandgap (∼2.7 eV) and superior light absorption capacity.99,100 Furthermore, the inherent vacancies and the sp2 hybridized structure were beneficial for delocalized electron migration.98,99 So far, various approaches (e.g., thermal polymerization, chemical functionalization, solvothermal, sol–gel methods, and template-assisted methods) have been applied to synthesize g-C3N4, and the obtained products usually exhibited different physicochemical properties. The thermal polymerization was the most commonly used method, owing to its outstanding technical simplicity. The thermal polymerization process was achieved via thermally polymerizing nitrogen (e.g., urea, triazoles, dicyandiamide, cyanamide, melamine, and thiourea) and carbon-rich precursors. Sudhaik et al.101 demonstrated melamine formation by polyaddition, and the amino groups' removal by polycondensation played essential roles in forming the g-C3N4 polymer network. Notably, the thermal conditions significantly influenced the preparation of g-C3N4, and different precursors required different pyrolysis temperatures for polymerization.102–104 Due to these excellent characteristics, g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-derived materials successfully boosted AOPs.105 For instance, Wang et al.106 prepared exfoliated oxygen doped g-C3N4 nanoflakes for PMS activation towards sulfamethoxazole removal. With the help of g-C3N4 nanoflakes, the kapp (0.079 min−1) was much higher than that in the g-C3N4/PMS system (0.0083 min−1).


2.2.2. Boron. 
As a neighbor of carbon, metal-free boron has also attracted enormous attention because of its high strength and hardness.107–109 Since it is highly similar to carbon on a cluster scale,110 the element boron was inferred to be active in catalysis. It was reported that both boron and carbon could serve as effective PMS activators (Table 4), but reaction mechanisms were different, which might be owing to different electronic configurations. For instance, Duan et al.111 demonstrated that PMS could be decomposed by ND (sp3) through a radical pathway. In contrast, the non-radical mechanism (surface reactive complexes) was verified in a graphitized ND (sp2/sp3)/PMS system. Notably, boron was prone to activate PMS via a revolutionary process due to its metallic properties endowed by one electron in its 2p orbital.112 As evidenced by the DFT calculations, the OSO3− of PMS preferred to accept electrons from boron, thus generating radicals (˙OH and SO42−).48

2.2.3. Covalent organic frameworks. 
The application of COFs in catalysis fields has attracted increasing attention in the past three years. COFs are crystalline polymers constructed by varieties of organic building blocks. They usually exhibit large specific surface areas, tunable pore size, well-defined structures, and excellent thermal stability. Therefore, COFs with these unprecedented advantages are considered ideal candidates, which can be applied in catalysis, gas sorption, and pollutant adsorption.120,121 At present, COFs are deemed promising catalysts in photocatalysis, which may be superior to other photocatalysts, such as metal oxides (e.g., TiO2 (ref. 122 and 123) and ZnO124), metal sulfides (CdS125), precious metal semiconductors (e.g., Bi2MoO6,126 BiOBr127 and Ag3PO4 (ref. 128)), non-metal semiconductors (e.g., g-C3N4 (ref. 129) and red phosphorus130), and porous polymers (MOFs131). For instance, both TiO2 and ZnO have a wide band gap (3.2 and 3.3 eV), which can only use ultraviolet light, making up four percent of solar energy. Although BiOBr and Bi2MoO6 have a moderate band gap (2.8 and 2.9 eV), they are relatively expensive and cannot meet the requirements for field applications. In addition, the MOFs obtained by coordination bonding (a weak bonding interaction) often exhibit poor thermal and chemical stability. Fortunately, a series of COF-based materials have been developed by recombination of COFs with other active catalysts (e.g., MOFs,132 metallic nanoparticles and graphene133), which not only preserve the structural characteristics of individual components but also show some new properties beneficial for catalytic reaction. For example, Yao et al.114 designed a novel metal-free catalyst (g-C3N4@COFs) and applied it for PMS-driven oxidation of orange II. Impressively, this composite exhibited better degradation of orange II (100%) than g-C3N4 (10%) and COFs (5%).

2.3. Separation of metal-free catalysts
Although metal-free catalysts (especially carbon-based catalysts) exhibited unique advantages in AOPs, they usually suffered from difficult separation due to their small particle sizes. Therefore, centrifugation and filtration were needed to separate the powdered catalysts from the aqueous phase, which limited their practical application. Notably, some pollutants and/or intermediates might be released into the water during the abovementioned separation steps, thus causing secondary pollution. To overcome these drawbacks, some transition metals (e.g., Fe, Co, and Ni) were introduced into carbon matrixes to endow them with magnetic properties, and thus they could be easily separated with the aid of a magnetic field.134,135 It is worth noting that the physicochemical properties of pristine catalysts might be affected by introducing magnetic species, which could enhance their catalytic activity. For instance, Yao et al.134 prepared magnetic MgFe2O4/BC and it could effectively activate PDS for levofloxacin degradation (87.87%), which was 8.86 times higher than that of the pristine BC. Preparing metal-free catalysts in the form of catalytic membranes was another promising method, which could eliminate the separation procedure. However, to the best of our knowledge, only several documents reported the applications of metal-free catalytic membranes in AOPs. For example, Sheng et al.136 fabricated rGO-based membranes to activate PDS for sulfamethoxazole elimination and a relatively stable sulfamethoxazole removal was obtained (>77%). Although metal-free catalysts could be effectively separated by these methods, more attention should be paid to the subsequent disposal of catalysts. Some pollutant intermediates could still adsorb on the surface of catalysts, which might be more toxic.

3.1. H2O2-based AOPs
H2O2-based AOPs are deemed to be traditional treatment techniques to eliminate contaminants from aqueous media. ˙OH could be generated from H2O2 by using homogeneous (such as the Fenton reaction) or heterogeneous catalysts (e.g., metal oxides, supported metal catalysts, graphite, and carbon-based catalysts).144 Owing to the complex roles of AC, the catalytic decomposition of H2O2 by AC required further investigation. The activation of H2O2 by AC involved the exchange of surface hydroxyl groups with hydrogen peroxide anions (HO2−) to form peroxide.144 Then the active sites of AC could be regenerated when H2O2 molecules were decomposed into O2.145 In addition to direct decomposition, it was also widely believed that the AC surface could readily activate H2O2 to form abundant ˙OH.146 AC could be considered as a medium for electron transfer, which involved two catalyst states (e.g., reduced (AC) and oxidized (AC+)):144AC + H2O2 → AC+ + HO− + ˙HOAC+ + H2O2 → AC + ˙HO + H+
Due to the high oxidation potential (E0 = 1.9–2.80 V), ˙OH rapidly degraded various intractable pollutants and even mineralized them into CO2 and H2O without selectivity.144,147–151 Kurniawan et al.144 evaluated the performance of an H2O2/GAC oxidation system for leachate (COD = 8000 mg L−1, NH3–N = 2595 mg L−1, BOD5/COD = 0.08) removal. The integrated oxidation process achieved a much higher removal than H2O2 oxidation alone (COD: 82% vs. 33%; NH3–N: 59% vs. 4.9%). Notably, the degradation of refractory compounds was further enhanced (from 82 to 89%) after adding an extra 1.8 g L−1 of Fe(II). Although the COD and NH3–N could not be reduced to the local limit (COD < 200 mg L−1 and NH3–N < 5 mg L−1) by this H2O2-induced oxidation, the biodegradability ratio (BOD5/COD = 0.36) was sharply improved by 350%, indicating that H2O2-induced pre-oxidation was favorable for subsequent biological treatments.
3.2. Persulfate-based AOPs
PMS (HSO5−) is an inorganic oxidant that has been widely used for organic compound synthesis.152 Additionally, PMS is also commonly used as a chlorine-free disinfectant in swimming pools.153,154 Heinrich Caro155 firstly demonstrated that the PMS anion originates from Caro's acid. In the past, Caro's acid could not be successfully transformed into stable mono-salts, whereas PMS can currently exist stably as a triple salt.156,157 It is reported that PMS is relatively stable in aqueous solution, with only 5% of reactive oxygen decreased within three days.158 Notably, PMS is most unstable when the solution pH is around 9 due to the equal concentration of HSO5− and SO52− (pKa2 = 9.4).159 The distance of the O–O bond of PMS was reported to be 1.453 Å, and as an oxidant with an unsymmetrical structure, it could partially oxidize refractory organic pollutants. For the first time, Dionysiou et al.160 introduced PMS for organic contaminant degradation in 2003.
Unlike PMS, the distance of the O–O bond of PDS was reported to be 1.497 Å, and it possessed a symmetric structure. AC, as a quintessential adsorbent with catalytic properties, could effectively activate PDS.161–163 Nevertheless, the surface of AC could readily be attacked by ROS, limiting its utilization. For instance, the catalytic activity decreased significantly in an AC/PDS system (>40%) in the second run, which might be attributed to the surface oxidation.164 Likewise, CNTs were also deemed promising activators of PDS due to their sp2 hybridized C and CO.165,166 For instance, Cheng et al.166 discovered that the content of CO groups increased significantly after glutaraldehyde modification, which dramatically increased the catalytic performance. Thus, it could be speculated that the content of CO would be increased by acid treatment modification or mild oxidization, which were favorable for boosting PDS activation. Notably, ongoing debates about the catalytic mechanism of PDS and PMS still exist. Ren et al.139 specifically compared differences between PMS and PDS activation coupled with N-doped CNTs. N-doped CNTs could adsorb a higher quantity of PMS than PDS, and thus the potential of carbon–PMS* complexes (C–PMS*) was much higher than that of carbon–PDS* complexes (C–PDS*).
It is worth noting that several assisting methods could also enhance the activation of PS with metal-free materials. For example, it was reported that PS activation by carbon materials could be significantly boosted with ultrasound assistance. Recently, Kakavandi et al.167 demonstrated that a slight enhancement in the degradation efficiency (36.8% to 38.5%) of tetracycline was observed with ultrasonic assistance. On the one hand, ultrasound itself could activate PS. Ultrasound could also generate thermal energy, which could decompose water molecules into ˙OH and other ROS. In addition, ultrasound could create microflows, and thus the catalyst surface might be refreshed with high activity for the generation of ROS.168 Likewise, microwave-assisted activation could also enhance pollutant elimination. The catalysts would absorb microwave radiation during the activation process and then generate abundant hot spots, thus accelerating electron movement.169 Light-assisted activation (λ = 200–400 nm) was also a promising method for enhancing carbon-activated PS systems. It was revealed that the contaminant degradation was effectively enhanced in a light-assisted PS system.170 With the assistance of light irradiation, the carbons might also be excited to generate photoinduced holes and electrons that could accelerate the generation of ROS.171 In addition, the active sites could be regenerated under light exposure, thus accelerating contaminant removal.172 Additionally, electricity was also combined with the carbon-activated PS system, which could optimize their removal performance towards carbamazepine.173 Song et al.174 investigated the PDS activation by coupling with several carbon-based catalysts with the assistance of electricity for sulfamethoxazole degradation, which were superior to carbon/PDS systems. On the one hand, PS could directly be activated by electricity to generate ROS.173 On the other hand, the condensed PS and pollutants on the catalyst's surface promoted interaction between the contaminants and PS ions.175 Additionally, more surface functional groups would be formed owing to electrooxidation, which might enhance catalytic performance.176
3.3. Ozone-based AOPs
O3-based AOPs were also widely studied and applied in water decontamination.179 Unlike the traditional Fenton process, O3 was able to directly oxidize contaminants containing unsaturated carbon bonds through the Criegee reaction due to its high oxidation potential (2.05 V).180 Over the past few years, carbocatalytic ozonation processes have been deemed capable alternatives to conventional metal-catalyzed ozonation.181 For the first time, Jans and Hoigné reported the ozone–carbon interactions in 1998 and abundant radicals (˙OH) were produced when ozone was activated by AC.44 Generally, ˙OH could be made from O3 through the following pathways: (i) self-decomposition and (ii) catalytic decomposition of O3. Notably, solution pH had a significant influence on the autodecomposition of O3. For instance, in acidic environments, it was really sluggish for O3 itself to produce ˙OH (k = 1.1 × 10−4 M−1 s−1), while ˙OH formation was highly dependent on the intermediates (HO2˙/O2˙−) in alkaline solution.182 Therefore, it was difficult to realize effective water decontamination relying on the autodecomposition of O3 regardless of the solution pH. In addition to free radical oxidation, nonradical species (e.g., 1O2 and surface-bound reactive complexes) were also reported to be favorable for organics removal in carbocatalytic ozonation.183 For example, Wang et al.177 investigated the carbocatalytic ozonation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid over rGO, which displayed a superior performance (100% within 30 min) (Fig. 10a). Notably, 1O2 was verified to make a certain contribution to contaminant oxidation according to the radical competition tests. Sun et al.178 proposed a novel electron-transfer regime in the N-doped carbon/O3 system, outperforming the system with O3 alone (Fig. 10b). An “electron-mobility” region supplied by graphitic N promoted the p-hydroxybenzoic acid removal through a nonradical reaction process, in which electrons were transferred from p-hydroxybenzoic acid to O3.

3.4. Other AOPs

3.4.1. Periodate. 
PI possesses a high oxidation–reduction potential (+1.60 V) and has been recognized as a competitive candidate for AOP applications.186 However, unactivated PI exhibited limited oxidative capability towards organic contaminants. Consequently, plenty of studies were devoted to improving its performance for the removal of organic contaminants via metal-free means. For example, UV irradiation could convert PI into more oxidative species (e.g., IO3˙, IO4˙, and ˙OH).187–189 The efficiency of the UV/TiO2 process could be further elevated by introducing PI as the additive.187 The PI could function as the electron scavenger of the conductive band, thus avoiding the recombination of hVB+ and eCB−. As a consequence, the presence of PI boosted the production of ˙OH that was able to degrade organic compounds. Likewise, carbon-based metal-free catalysts showed promising efficiency for the activation of PI.190,191 Inspired by the catalytic role of GAC towards H2O2 and PS activation, Li et al.43 explored the PI activation by GAC. The results revealed that GAC could improve the decolorization of acid orange 7 by PI. Additionally, IO3˙, rather than ˙OH, was the dominant ROS responsible for the decolorization reaction. Moreover, regulating the electronic configuration of carbon materials by doping N and/or Fe could further enhance the activation of PI. He et al.184 designed an Fe,N-doped catalyst for PI activation and the mechanisms were identified via DFT calculations. As depicted in Fig. 11a–c, the adsorption energies between PI and N-doped, Fe doped, and Fe,N doped carbon were 3.09, 6.69, and 6.82 eV, respectively, which indicated that PI was more likely to be adsorbed on the Fe,N doped carbon surface through chemisorption, whereas N atoms might adsorb PI via physical adsorption. Moreover, the length of Fe–O of Fe,N co-doped carbon (1.82 Å) was shorter than that of Fe-doped carbon (1.86 Å), meaning that the chemical bond was more stable, which was conducive to the PI adsorption (Fig. 11d–f). Therefore, Fe,N co-doped carbon enhanced the activation of PI, as evidenced by the prolonged I–O bond (from 1.79 to 1.93 Å). In addition, according to the charge density difference results (Fig. 11f), an electron-transfer channel was established, which was beneficial for sulfadiazine degradation.

3.4.2. Peracetic acid. 
As a synthetic chemical, the O–OH bond of PAA was weaker than that of H2O2, and thus it was easier to be decomposed for oxidation of organic contaminants.192 Transition metal ions were considered adequate for PAA activation, whereas the poor stability and potential toxicity limited their further applications.34,193 Therefore, a novel and green catalyst for PAA activation would be highly needed. To date, only two researches have been published on using a carbon-based catalyst to activate PAA. In 2015, Zhou et al.37 used AC fibers to activate PAA for dye degradation and the pollutant could be effectively removed in the AC fibers/PAA process. The AC fibers could donate their non-bonding electrons to PAA, resulting in homolytic cleavage of the peroxide bond and generating ˙OH and CH3C(O)O˙. Dai et al.194 prepared AC by thermal modification for PAA activation toward sulfamethoxazole degradation in 2022. The reaction rate (10.79 M−1 s−1) in the AC/PAA system was much higher than those in PAA alone (0.034 M−1 s−1) and AC alone (1.774 M−1 s−1). In addition, CH3C(O)OO˙, CH3C(O)O˙ and the electron-transfer regime dominated the oxidation process, which differed from typical AOPs.


3.4.3. Permanganate. 
Mn(VII) has aroused increasing attention because of its low cost, excellent stability, and ease of handling. Moreover, negligible toxic byproducts would be produced owing to its low reactivity with bromide and chloride. In addition, the reduction products (MnO2) of Mn(VII) could be effectively eliminated by the subsequent treatment, such as coagulation and filtration. Zhang et al.185 demonstrated that permanganate could effectively degrade sulfamethazine (0.0217 min−1) without any catalyst under visible light. In general, the atom with a higher condensed dual descriptor value was more likely to be attacked. Due to the electrophilicity of ROS (i.e., Mn(VII), Mn(III) and O2˙−), electrophilic attack (f−) was the main attack mode. As depicted in Fig. 11g, the N26 atom had a lower condensed dual descriptor value (−0.0452) and was surrounded by the negative isosurface of the Fukui index, and thus it might be the priority site.


3.4.4. Ferrate. 
Similarly, ferrate (Fe(VI)) was also demonstrated to be valid for organics degradation,195–198 pathogen inactivation, and sewage sludge stabilization.199 It was reported that Fe(V) and Fe(IV) species were responsible for organic oxidation. More specifically, Fe(V) and Fe(IV) species were more reactive, which made them unstable, making it easier for them to react with target compounds as compared with Fe(VI).200,201 Therefore, it is meaningful to explore promising catalysts to produce more intermediate iron species. For example, Tian et al.77 found that commercial BC coupled with ferrate could facilitate ciprofloxacin removal. Less than 7% of ciprofloxacin could be removed by BC adsorption, whereas 97% of ciprofloxacin was degraded by ferrate within 20 min. Impressively, the content of ciprofloxacin dropped rapidly below the detection limit in the BC/ferrate system within 5 min.

4. Activation mechanisms of metal-free catalyzed AOPs
4.1. Radical-driven pathway

4.1.1. Hydroxyl radicals. 
Hydroxylation and hydrogen abstraction were two main strategies for ˙OH induced contaminant degradation.202 For instance, hydrogen extraction occurred first in aliphatic carboxylic acids during the ˙OH-driven pathway, leading to the formation of carbon-center radicals, which in turn reacted with O2.203


4.1.2. Sulfate radicals. 
Owing to its unique electron-transfer regime, SO4˙− was more selective and substrate-dependent than ˙OH. For instance, ˙OH could react with humic acids at ∼104 L mg C−1, which was much higher than SO4˙− (∼103 L mg C−1).204 Additionally, SO4˙− was extremely sensitive to substituents of aromatic substances and the reaction pathway was significantly affected by the types of substituents.205 For example, SO4˙− preferentially reacted with substituents that could serve as electron donors to produce aromatic radical cations, which might be further rearranged to undergo side-chain oxidation.206


4.1.3. Chlorine radicals. 
Chlorine radicals (Cl˙) were reported to be the derivatively reactive species generated in AOPs.207 The typical redox potential of Cl˙ was 2.4 V, and Cl˙ possessed much higher selectivity than ˙OH. As a result, Cl˙ was even more reactive with benzoic acid, a well-known chemical probe for ˙OH.208,209 Due to its selectivity, hydrogen abstraction and one-electron oxidation were the primary mechanisms for the Cl˙ dominated oxidation processes.210 As chlorine radicals oxidized organic pollutants, chlorination by-products would be inevitable, which attracted widespread attention to their potential danger.211,212 The reaction regime should be meticulously discussed when the chloride ion is involved in the degradation of organic pollutants. The mechanisms were often complicated when electron-rich substances were the target pollutants because chlorine radicals, ˙OH, and SO4˙− were all capable of oxidizing contaminants. Specific mechanisms could be identified by comparing differences in products. For example, in processes driven by ˙OH and SO4˙−, the addition of Cl− would lead to chlorine radical formation, accelerating electron-rich contaminant elimination. Nonetheless, the degradation of the target pollutants was not enhanced, meaning that Cl− played a minor role. The addition of Cl− might be likely to shift the process driven by ˙OH and SO4˙− to another oxidation process driven by ˙OH/SO4˙− and Cl˙. However, only a few studies superficially discussed this mechanism shift.

4.2. Nonradical-driven pathway

4.2.1. Direct oxidation. 
In addition to the role of the radicals mentioned above, some pollutants could also be directly oxidized without any radicals being involved. For example, Chen et al.213 reported that β-lactam antibiotics were oxidized directly via two-electron transfer in the PMS-induced oxidation process. It was also revealed that PMS was able to directly degrade sulfonamides through selectively attacking the nitrogen or sulfur atoms on benzene rings.214 Nonetheless, it was of great necessity to overcome two obstacles to realize the direct oxidation of contaminants. On the one hand, direct oxidation could only oxidize a small part of the pollutants due to its low oxidation capacity. On the other hand, direct oxidation was only applied to the contaminants containing electron-rich groups. As a result, direct oxidation usually needed to be combined with different reaction pathways (e.g., pre-adsorption, radicals and nonradicals) to achieve efficient removal of pollutants through complementation.


4.2.2. Singlet oxygenation. 
Singlet oxygen was another highly selective ROS that could oxidize unsaturated contaminants through electrophilic attack and electron abstraction.215 It was demonstrated that alkenes could be degraded by 1O2, and the degradation products differed with alkene structures.216 In addition, superoxide radicals would be formed when 1O2 (electron acceptor) reacted with phenolic compounds with electron-donating groups.217 Different from ˙OH and SO4˙−, the redox potential of 1O2 was relatively lower (0.81 V). Therefore, the reaction rates of 1O2 (104 to 107 M−1 s−1) with organic pollutants were generally lower than those with radicals.218 In particular, furfuryl alcohol, as the probe for detecting 1O2, possessed a much higher reaction rate (∼108 M−1 s−1). It was challenging to realize the rapid degradation of contaminants by 1O2 in actual wastewater within the range of reaction rates mentioned above. In addition, we should be aware that 1O2 may not be a viable method for the mineralization of contaminants because of its low redox potential. Nevertheless, recent studies attributed the degradation and mineralization of pollutants to 1O2, which might exaggerate its role.219,220 In fact, these conclusions were suspectable and required further confirmation with solid proof. For example, it was reported that water could quench 1O2 at a relatively high reaction rate constant (∼105 M−1 s−1).166 If 1O2 dominated contaminant degradation in water, the reaction rate of 1O2 with contaminants ought to be at least higher than 108 M−1 s−1 from the point of view of competitive kinetics.


4.2.3. Metastable high-potential complexes. 
Recently, a novel electron transfer regime (metastable complexes) was proposed in AOPs, and it usually involves 2 steps: (i) pre-adsorption and subsequent activation; (ii) pollutant degradation and SO42− release. Generally, such nonradical mechanisms were often revealed by excluding the roles of radicals and 1O2 at first. For instance, Guan et al.221 reported that bromophenols could still be effectively removed in a PMS/CNT system with an excessive injection of MeOH and NaN3, which implied that other active species (metastable high-potential complexes) were involved. In such a nonradical process, target contaminants and the oxidants could be adsorbed onto the catalyst's surface. After that, the adsorbed oxidant would be activated to form catalyst–oxidant complexes, which possessed high redox potential. When the redox potential of the complexes exceeded the oxidation potential of pollutants, electrons would be extracted from the pollutants. Therefore, the catalyst used for oxidant activation could also function as the conductive bridge, which was beneficial for charge migration. Notably, the electron transfer mechanism greatly relied on the co-existence of conductors, chemical oxidants, and target pollutants. Recently, a galvanic oxidation system, which could separate target pollutants (electron donors) and oxidants (electron accepters) into two half cells, was established for the identification of electron transfer. Bisphenol A was rapidly removed upon the injection of PMS in the other cell, which confirmed the occurrence of electron transfer.222 Electrochemical tests (e.g., electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and linear sweep voltammetry) were also practical in identifying the mediated electron transfer regime due to catalysts' strong electron conduction capacity. Meanwhile, the chronoamperometry method could visually reflect the generation of current.223 In addition, measuring the variation of the open circuit potential of the carbon surface could also reflect the formation of metastable complexes, which could further be confirmed by the in situ Raman spectra. For example, Miao et al.224 monitored the open circuit potential of C–PMS* to confirm the formation of the complex. As expected, the potentials increased upon PMS injection, implying that C–PMS* with enhanced oxidation power was formed. Furthermore, in situ Raman spectroscopy was employed to reflect the surface chemistry evolution of the catalyst during PMS activation for 4-chlorophenol removal. The characteristic peaks for PMS alone were successfully detected at 979 (SO42−) and 1093 cm−1 (HSO5−). It is worth noting that a new peak (1146 cm−1) emerged with injection of PMS, which might be due to the PMS* bonding with the catalyst surface. Nevertheless, in addition to the SO42−, PMS and PMS* peaks almost disappeared after adding the 4-chlorophenol, implying that the metastable complexes dominated the oxidation process. In addition, only those contaminants with low oxidation potential values (<9.0 eV) were efficiently degraded. Thus, this process could be determined by comparing the degradation rate of organics with different oxidation potential values.225,226


4.2.4. High-valent metals. 
In addition to the abovementioned non-radical regimes, an FeIV-dominated catalytic mechanism was proposed in the Fe2+/H2O2 system in the 1990s.227 FeIV could oxidize many compounds via electron or atom transfer.228 It was also demonstrated that FeIV could degrade organics that contained electron-rich groups.229 The high selectivity of FeIV endowed it with efficient oxidizing capacity for organics removal, and it exhibited strong interference with impurities.230 To detect the existence of FeIV, sulfoxides were employed to react with FeIV, which would form specific intermediates based on Pestovsky and Bakac's study.231 Moreover, DFT calculations were performed for elucidating the evolution of FeIV species, which began with the O–O cleavage and was followed by the proton-coupled electron transfer. Up until now, it has been widely accepted that ˙OH tends to be generated in an acid medium (pH < 6) and FeIV species are often induced at a nearly neutral pH. Recently, FeIV species were also detected in other AOPs. Wang et al.232 revealed the FeIV species dominated-oxidation process under acidic conditions by utilizing a chemical probe (methyl phenyl sulfoxide). Notably, according to the latest report, FeIV species and radicals could participate in the FeII-catalyzed PDS system simultaneously, and thus they could effectively complement each other for different organics elimination due to the difference in selectivity.233 Additionally, FeIV was also detected in the PAA system, in which FeIV was crucial for contaminant elimination.234 Compared with FeIV, less attention was paid to CoIV species that would also occur in AOPs. Zong et al.235 revealed the existence of CoIV in the CoII/PMS system, and CoIV showed higher efficiency for nitrobenzene removal than SO4˙−. In another research, Huang et al.236 also verified the existence of CoIV with a probe (dimethyl sulfoxide). Moreover, CoIV was reported to be produced in a CoII/PAA system through a nonradical regime, which was more likely to degrade pollutants with low ionization potential.237 In addition, Mn, as a transition metal, possessed various valence states. For instance, MnII could often function as the electron donor because of its low valence, which was demonstrated to be beneficial for catalysis.238 Meanwhile, MnII could be oxidized to high-valence manganese species (e.g., MnIII and MnIV) during the oxidation reaction.239 In addition, as a novel oxidant, potassium permanganate (MnVII) was used for water decontamination, during which MnVII would be reduced to low-valence manganese species (e.g., MnII and MnIII). Similarly, the chemical probe was used for the detection of Mn species.

5. Degradation of antibiotics by metal-free catalyzed AOPs
Based on different chemical structures of antibiotics, they could be commonly divided into four categories (i.e., quinolones, tetracyclines, β-lactams, and sulfonamides). The kapp of several representative antibiotics (i.e., amoxicillin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline) is summarized in Fig. 12, indicating that sulfadiazine, ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole were more difficult to degrade, while amoxicillin and norfloxacin might be removed easily. The basic structure of quinolone antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin) was 4-quinolone.169,278,279 During the degradation of quinolone antibiotics, quinolone rings were often attacked by the ROS, resulting in the decomposition of quinolones to intermediates, CO2 and H2O. Tetracycline antibiotics, as another commonly used class of drugs, were planar polycyclic structures composed of four hydrocarbon rings.172,280 Likewise, tetracycline antibiotics could also be successfully degraded via attacking the C–N, C–C, and CC bonds of tetracycline antibiotics.281 In addition, β-lactam antibiotics including penicillin and cephalosporin were also one of the most frequently used antibacterial drugs in the world.282 Generally, the stability of penicillin was weaker than that of cephalosporin owing to its larger ring tension.283 Notably, the β-lactam, thiazole and thiazide rings of antibiotics were often the prime targets due to their high electron densities, and the carboxyl groups on carbon-based materials and the ROS produced in AOPs could synergically destroy the side chains of these rings.283

5.1. Performances
As depicted in Fig. 13, the k values for reactions of several commonly detected ROS (i.e., ˙OH, SO4˙−, 1O2, and Cl˙) with different antibiotics were systematically analyzed. It was reported that the redox potentials of ˙OH and SO4˙− were 1.9–2.8 V and 2.5–3.1 V, respectively, while that of Cl˙ was about 2.4 V. Fig. 13 compared the k values for different ROS with antibiotics. In general, the reactivities of ˙OH and Cl˙ toward other antibiotics were similar at k values from 108 to 1011 M−1 s−1, which were slightly higher than those of SO4˙− (106 to 1011 M−1 s−1). In addition, the k values of 1O2 toward most antibiotics were much lower than those of radical species due to their high selectivity. Before the oxidation, antibiotics were usually firstly adsorbed on the catalyst surface due to the universal interfacial interactions. This interaction could be regulated by the surface properties of the solid catalysts. Dozens of works fully evidenced that the adsorption capacity of antibiotics extensively relied on the exposed surface area.11 The functional groups could also participate in the adsorption process by forming covalent bonds between antibiotics and surface functional groups. Though adsorption could not achieve the oxidation of antibiotics, it could directly affect the degradation of antibiotics by generating ROS. As reported, more adsorbed antibiotics and oxidants on the surface of carbon materials would be beneficial for the subsequent catalytic reaction.287 Thus, the adsorption process might be the rate-limiting step of antibiotics removal.93 Due to the abundant surface functional groups, AC could play a vital role in the pre-adsorption stage, and acid modification could lead to the generation of more acidic oxygen-containing groups, thus boosting the catalytic oxidation reaction. Compared with AC, BC without any chemical or physical activation often possessed a lower specific surface area (<500 m2 g−1). However, due to its abundant functional groups and low cost, it was also deemed a competitive metal-free catalyst. Wang et al.94 fabricated BC by using corncob biomass as the precursor, which performed superior sulfadiazine removal by activating PDS. Unlike the metal mediated radical regime, an electron transfer pathway was proved to dominate the oxidation system. Benefitting from this special mechanism, this oxidation system demonstrated high resistance to the inorganic anions in complex water matrixes. In another work, Ding et al.11 prepared BC with metal-enriched phytoremediation plant residue, which exhibited an ultrahigh surface area (1090.7 m2 g−1). However, neither H2O2 nor PDS could be effectively activated by BC for ciprofloxacin removal. Notably, when coupled with PMS (5 mM), more than 2 mmol g−1 ciprofloxacin could be rapidly adsorbed and degraded within 30 min. In addition to PS, permanganate was also applied to removal antibiotics. Tian et al.78 investigated the degradation behavior of sulfamethoxazole by KMnO4. The results showed that sulfamethoxazole could hardly be oxidized by KMnO4 alone. Notably, when BC and KMnO4 were injected into sulfamethoxazole solution, sulfamethoxazole could be rapidly and effectively removed within 30 min (97%). Likewise, Peng et al.288 reported that with the assistance of graphite, the oxidation ability of KMnO4-based AOPs would be boosted. In their study, the graphite mediated one-electron transfer from sulfamethoxazole to KMnO4 led to high KMnO4 utilization efficiency. Moreover, this oxidation system was designed as a fixed bed device, which demonstrated that even in the actual wastewater, most of the sulfamethoxazole could be removed (>85%), confirming the strong resistance to complex water matrixes.

5.2. Degradation pathways

5.2.1. Sulfonamide antibiotics. 
The degradation mechanisms and pathways of antibiotics were mainly dependent on their types. In general, different antibiotics' degradation pathways were inconsistent, but some similar patterns could also be observed in the degradation process. In order to have a better understanding of the antibiotic evolution in oxidation systems, revealing the degradation pathway of antibiotics was significant. Qi et al.267 summarized the radical-induced degradation pathway of sulfonamides by taking sulfamethoxazole as an example. The results demonstrated that the ˙OH and SO4˙− were more likely to attack the S–N bond of sulfamethoxazole and formed the 3-methyl-5-amino-isoxazole and monohydroxylated sulfanilic acid. Finally, the isoxazole ring was further oxidized and transformed into CO2 and H2O. Compared with radicals, nonradicals might degrade antibiotics in a different way. The Fukui function value fA− was often adopted to mirror the active sites of antibiotics degraded by 1O2-induced AOPs. For example, Qi et al.267 reported that the 11N atom of sulfamethoxazole possessed the highest fA− value. Therefore, 1O2 preferred to attack the 11N atom of the aniline ring. Additionally, the 1C, 3C, and 5C atoms were also effectively attacked by 1O2. Hence, the high fA− values were often observed at the aniline and benzene rings of the sulfamethoxazole molecule, leading to the transformation of aniline and splitting or hydroxylation on benzene rings. In another study, Yin et al.289 demonstrated that the highest fA− value of sulfamethoxazole was the 8N atom of the aniline ring, implying that 1O2 was prone to attack the 8N atom. Besides, the 2C, 4C, and 6C atoms located at the aniline of the sulfamethoxazole molecule could also be easily attacked by 1O2, resulting in sulfamethoxazole degradation. Based on the calculation results, it could be concluded that the degradation pathways of sulfamethoxazole by 1O2 were not the same as those in ˙OH-induced oxidation. The ˙OH preferred to attack the 7S atom of the sulfamethoxazole, and thus the 7S–10N bond would break down. Nevertheless, 1O2 was more prone to oxidize the 8N atom and aniline ring of sulfamethoxazole. In addition, the highest occupied molecular orbital could also reflect the active sites of antibiotics. Peng et al.288 proposed that the highest occupied molecular orbital of sulfamethoxazole was mainly located on the side with benzene rings, in which it was easier for electrons to escape, and thus they would be easily attacked. Notably, the degradation pathways of antibiotics might be quite distinct in different carbon-induced AOPs.289,290 For instance, Yin et al.289 reported that sulfamethoxazole was degraded via splitting of the aniline ring in the sludge BC induced nonradical oxidation. In contrast, Wang et al.290 proposed that the aniline group and the N5 atom of sulfamethoxazole were easier to attack in the wheat straw BC mediated radical oxidation.


5.2.2. Tetracycline antibiotics. 
Tetracycline antibiotics could be degraded into several intermediates during the metal-free AOPs and the main reaction pathways could be subdivided into hydroxylation, decarboxylation, demethylation, dehydroxylation, etc. For example, Zhang et al.276 investigated the tetracycline degradation in a BC/PMS system. Four potential degradation pathways were proposed. In pathway 1, the tetracycline could be degraded into an intermediate with m/z = 461 via hydroxylation and further converted to intermediates with m/z = 433 and 387 through demethylation. In pathway 2, the tetracycline could first be converted to intermediates with m/z = 387, 371 and 355 via C–N bond cleavage, hydroxylation, terminal oxidation, etc. Then these intermediates were further degraded by hydroxylation. Similarly, in pathway 3 and pathway 4, various tetracycline intermediates (m/z = 416, 402, 333, 432, 387 and 287) were formed through the demethylation and hydroxylation. Eventually, these tetracycline intermediates were converted to H2O and CO2.


5.2.3. Quinolone antibiotics. 
The quinolone rings were the main targets, which could be attacked by the ROS. Then the quinolone antibiotics could be converted to some intermediates, CO2 and H2O via several pathways (e.g., carbonylation and decarboxylation). For instance, Qu et al.246 identified the degradation pathways of ciprofloxacin in a PMS/BC system. Two potential pathways were responsible for ciprofloxacin degradation. Pathway 1 began with the attack of quinolone rings by ROS, followed by the formation of C1 (C17H18FN3O4) and C2 (C17H16FN3O7). Finally, C3 (C17H16FN3O6) was formed by the decarboxylation process. On the other hand, in pathway 2, C4 (C16H16FN3O4) and C5 (C17H16FN3O5) were formed from the oxidation of piperazine rings. Then C6 (C13H20FN2), C7 (C14H11FN2O5) and C8 (C14H9FN2O4) were produced via the loss of formaldehyde and amine nitrogen. Notably, C8 (C14H9FN2O4) had the lowest molecular weight among all intermediates, suggesting that the piperazine ring cracking was the main pathway for ciprofloxacin removal.


5.2.4. β-Lactam antibiotics. 
β-Lactam antibiotics are another class of commonly used antibacterial agents and Dou et al.291 summarized the regularity of degradation pathways by analyzing seven β-lactam antibiotics (i.e., amoxicillin, benzylpenicillin, cefotaxime, cefalexin, meropenem, aztreonam and sulbactam). Generally, the degradation of β-lactam antibiotics began with the fracture and hydrolysis of the four-membered β-lactam ring.292 Then some of the bonds (e.g., C–N and C–C) in the main chain broke directly and thus the antibiotic molecule was split into two separate molecules.293 Notably, the shedding of branches usually occurred during the oxidation process. For β-lactam antibiotics, the –COOH generated after the hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring could fall off easily.294

6. Inactivation of ARB by metal-free catalyzed AOPs
Due to the slow metabolization of antibiotics in the body, unmetabolized antibiotics tended to accumulate in the aquatic environment, resulting in the evolution of ARB.295,296 For instance, amoxicillin was considered to be slowly metabolized, with up to 86 ± 8% excreted in urine.297 Conventional wastewater treatment technologies were only designed for removing N, P, and some organic pollutants, which could not completely inactivate ARB.298 To this end, significant efforts were made to establish alternative approaches to the ARB threat (Table 6). Photocatalysis based on visible light was deemed an attractive candidate, effectively reducing the reliance on ultraviolet light, which accounted for only 4% of sunlight. Some semiconductor catalysts were reported to generate ROS (e.g., ˙O2−, ˙OH, h+) when stimulated by visible light, which was capable of inactivating ARB.299 For example, carbon nitride with advantages of low cost and simple preparation was expected to be the ideal product for large-scale applications in the future. Nevertheless, the limited active sites caused by the stacked structure of carbon nitride were detrimental to its catalytic performance.300 Several methods were employed to modulate the activity of carbon nitride. Pore-forming techniques were beneficial for enhancing the inactivation of E. coli by increasing the surface area of catalysts.295 For the g-C3N4 with higher surface area (230 m2 g−1), 4 h was enough for E. coli K-12 complete inactivation, but in the case of g-C3N4 with low surface area (12 m2 g−1), only 90% of E. coli could be inactivated even with an extended reaction time (6 h), highlighting that the surface area of catalysts played critical roles in their antibacterial function. It was also reported that the inactivation effect could be further boosted when the stacked structures of carbon nitride were destroyed.301 Zhao et al.301 prepared the atomic single layer g-C3N4 by thermal etching ultrasonic exfoliation. Impressively, 2 × 107 CFU mL−1 of E. coli were completely inactivated on the atomic single layer g-C3N4 within 4 h, which was superior to that of bulk g-C3N4 (3 log). The enhanced photocatalytic activity of atomic single layer g-C3N4 was mainly due to the low charge transfer resistance and high charge separation efficiency. Nonetheless, in the abovementioned systems, O2˙−, e− and h+ were the major ROS, whereas the role of ˙OH and SO4˙− was minor due to its low production.296 Thus, more ROS with higher oxidation capacity were required to enhance ARB inactivation. Recently, combining photocatalysis and PS might be effective for simultaneous disinfection and decontamination of contaminated water. For example, Berruti et al.302 explored the purification of urban wastewater by using an UVC/PMS system. The removal efficiency of this oxidation system was assessed according to the degradation of three contaminants (>80% within 12 min) and inactivation of three representative bacteria (<10 CFU per 100 mL after 12 min). It is worth noting that the detection limit of all ARB could reach 1 CFU per 100 mL, whereas the 16S rRNA and intI1 were only removed by 50%, meaning that ARGs rather than ARB were the challenges for water decontamination. Moreover, Gao et al.303 successfully fabricated the CN–CV2 catalyst by simple thermal polymerization and applied it in the PS/UV system. Due to the existence of C–(N)3, the adsorption energy of PS on CN–CV2 increased significantly (from −8.924 to −18.340 eV), which resulted in a significant elongation of the O–O bond of oxidants (from 1.505 to 1.519 Å). Thus, PS could be effectively activated by the defect site electrons and the removal efficiencies of the CN–CV2/PS system against six antibiotics were much higher than those of CN (10.5–32.1 times) and CN–CV2 (2.9–4.4 times), respectively. In addition, E. coli and E. faecalis screened from WWTPs could be obviously inactivated in the CN–CV2/PS system. Notably, the inactivation rates of E. coli and E. faecalis in the CN–CV2/PS system were 3.6 and 2.7 log higher than those of CN–CV2 and 5.1 and 5.6 log higher than those of CN. According to the quenching experiments and ESR characterization, SO4˙−, ˙OH and 1O2 were proved to be the main ROS in the CN–CV2/PS system, which were responsible for ARB inactivation. Except PS, PI was also combined with photocatalysis for ARB inactivation. Liu et al.304 demonstrated that E. coli (1 × 108 CFU mL−1) was effectively inactivated below the limit of detection (10 CFU mL−1) within 100 min by PI/solar-induced AOPs. ROS such as O2˙− and ˙OH were responsible for bacterial disinfection, which would attack and penetrate the cell membrane. Thus, there was a significant increase in the intracellular ROS amount, accelerating and promoting the destruction of the intracellular defense system.

7. Reduction of ARGs by metal-free catalyzed AOPs
Apart from antibiotics and ARB, ARGs have also attracted increasing attention in recent years, which are highly resistant to antibiotics and cannot be effectively killed, thus threatening human health.312 Based on the data reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least 23000 people die from infections caused by those bacterial strains in America each year.313 The commonly detected antibiotics and their related ARGs (Table 7) include sulfonamides (e.g., Sul1 and Sul2), fluoroquinolones (e.g., qnrA, qnrB and qnrC), tetracyclines (e.g., tetA, tetB, tetC and tetW) and β-lactam (e.g., blaTEM and blaDHA).314–320 In general, ARGs are present in the form of intracellular ARGs (iARGs) and extracellular ARGs (eARGs).321 Notably, eARGs are generated by the release of iARGs and the secretion from bacterial cells and eARGs have a shorter half-life than iARGs.322 Thus, the abundance of eARGs are about two orders of magnitude lower than iARGs in the aquatic system.323 In addition, ARGs can also be divided into three categories (i.e., iARGs, free eARGs and adsorbed eARGs (adsorbed to cells and/or particles)).324 Free eARGs can pass through the 0.22 μm filter, whereas other ARGs (i.e., iARGs and adsorbed eARGs) cannot pass through the 0.22 μm filter.325 It should be pointed out that different kinds of ARGs may exhibit different behaviors in various disinfection processes. For example, Liu et al.326 demonstrated that the absolute abundance of total eARGs changed slightly after chlorination disinfection. Notably, the abundance of eARGs (i.e., tetM and gyrA) decreased significantly, whereas the vanA abundance increased obviously, suggesting that different kinds of eARGs had different antioxidant capacities and chlorination could selectively reduce the eARGs. In addition, owing to the protection of cell membranes, iARGs were likely to be more difficult to be removed than eARGs. For instance, Yoon et al.327 reported that different UV fluences were needed for the eARG (60–90 mJ cm−2) and iARG (100–140 mJ cm−2) removal (4-log reduction), respectively.

Generally speaking, ARGs are usually located in the plasmid DNAs in bacterial cells, which can be transferred to another bacterial cell through horizontal gene transfer (e.g., conjugation, transduction, and natural transformation), thus forming new colonies of ARB.330 Therefore, inactivating plasmid DNA is considered a promising strategy for prohibiting the rapid spread of ARB. Photocatalysis is a powerful technique for the inactivation and degradation of various waterborne pollutants. For instance, Ganguly et al.331 demonstrated that carbocatalysts could function as antimicrobial agents, which might enhance the disinfection process under photocatalysis. Recently, TiO2 was also successfully applied to inactivate the ARGs under UV illumination.332 In addition, ARGs could also be reduced by other oxidation processes (e.g., Fenton-like processes, carbocatalytic ozonation, and UV-based AOPs).333,334 The latest metal-free AOPs for ARG removal are summarized in Table 8.

7.1. Performances
Although disinfection processes were able to inactivate the ARB by damaging bacterial DNA or cell structures, ARGs might still be present in cell debris. Wang et al.339 discovered that the Fenton process could effectively decrease the abundance of ARGs and class 1 integrons (intI1). Interestingly, alkaline and microwave assistance could increase the abundance of several ARGs and intI1. The integrated treatment of alkaline, microwave and Fenton reduced the gene abundance. UV/H2O2 was another commonly used AOP that could generate abundant ˙OH. Sanganyado et al.340 proposed that combining UV-irradiation with H2O2 significantly improved the elimination of ARB and ARGs. Nevertheless, the limited UV irradiation and uncontrolled turbidity in wastewater might greatly hinder its application. O3 was also capable of removing ARGs and its efficiency was usually dependent on the O3 dose.333 Zheng et al.309 reported that the abundance of ARGs was remarkably decreased with an optimal O3 dose of 2 mg L−1 (Fig. 14a). Zhong et al.310 assessed the photocatalytic activity of a urea-based g-C3N4 for ARG inactivation. Atomic force microscopy was used to characterize the extracellular DNA status before and after the disinfection process. As shown in Fig. 14b, an intact circular conformation of the model extracellular DNA was observed before irradiation. Upon photocatalytic treatment, the DNA molecules started to crack and were disrupted and linear, respectively (Fig. 14c and d), suggesting that extracellular DNA was damaged under simulated solar light. In another study, Ding et al.341 evaluated the inactivation of ARB by g-C3N4 induced photocatalysis. The ARB isolates were isolated from the secondary effluents of four WWTPs, and the inactivation ranges were 0.25–0.39 log and 0.16–0.19 log, respectively. Notably, g-C3N4 induced photocatalysis effectively increased the values to 0.64–1.26 log and 0.31–0.41 log under the same experimental conditions, respectively. Saha et al.311 synthesized a ternary nanocomposite consisting of g-C3N4, rGO and iron oxide (Fig. 14e). Two types of plasmid DNAs (pUC18: 2686 bp and pBR322: 4361 bp) containing the sequence of ARGs (ampicillin resistance genes) were effectively inactivated by the nanocomposite with the assistance of H2O2 and visible light. As expected, nanocomposite/H2O2 was superior to g-C3N4/H2O2, as evidenced by the electrophoresis results. SO4˙−-based AOPs were also deemed highly-selective oxidation processes, which might apply to ARG inactivation.342 For example, Zhang et al.334 demonstrated that SO4˙− produced by heat-activated PS could significantly reduce ARGs (i.e., ereB, ermA, and ermB). Nevertheless, only a few metal-free catalysts were applied to activate PS for ARG removal. Gao et al.303 confirmed that the absolute abundance of tetA was decreased significantly (from 1.08 × 108 to 3.19 × 105 copies per mL) by the oxidative treatment of a metal-free catalyzed PS process (Fig. 14f). Similarly, the absolute abundance of intI1 was also obviously decreased from 5.74 × 108 to 8.74 × 105 copies per mL, suggesting that the horizontal transfer of ARGs was significantly inhibited.

7.2. Mechanism
As mentioned above, various ROS could be produced in AOPs, such as ˙OH, SO4˙−, O2˙− and 1O2, with different characteristics and redox potentials, which might induce different oxidation pathways.

7.2.1. ˙OH. 
˙OH was a kind of strong non-selective ROS with high redox potential (1.7–2.8 V), which could effectively destroy biomolecular structures (e.g., proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acid) and it was able to oxidize almost all organic cell constituents at nearly diffusion-controlled rates.343 Notably, only DNA, lipids, and proteins were likely to serve as the initial targets among various cell constituents. Nevertheless, it was still not clear which components ROS attacked first, although this knowledge had considerable practical implications. Recently, accumulating evidence demonstrated that the damage to DNA and lipids was a secondary process and proteins were more likely to serve as the initial targets. For example, ˙OH could react quickly with various enzymes such as lysozyme and ribonuclease efficiently. Protein was proved to be the primary target of bacteria during wastewater purification and disinfection. As reported, ˙OH had multiple effects (e.g., oxidizing amino acids and modifying sulfur groups) on the typical structure of proteins.344,345 In addition, ˙OH might also have the potential for oxidation of and damage to base and ribose moieties in DNA.344


7.2.2. SO4˙−. 
Unlike electron neutral ˙OH, which could easily access the microbial surface, the negative charge of SO4˙− often caused electrostatic repulsion between SO4˙− and microorganisms.346 It was reported that SO4˙− could dissolve the cell envelope, thereby increasing intracellular substrate consumption and genome breakdown.347 Similarly, Bosshard et al.348 discovered that SO4˙− preferentially destroyed the cell envelope, and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) yield was significantly inhibited by restraining enzymes in the respiratory chain. More specifically, the ATP synthase was primarily located on the cell membrane that would preferentially be attacked by SO4˙−, leading to the leakage of intracellular components. It is worth noting that SO4˙− was also deemed an essential intermediate in the formation of the guanine radical cation, which dominated the attack of DNA.349


7.2.3. O2˙−. 
Additionally, the role of O2˙− should also be considered in the disinfection process. It was reported that O2˙− could significantly inhibit the growth of E. coli even at a low concentration (1.5 nM), which was more efficient than other ROS (e.g., 1O2 (1 mM) and ˙OH (>10 mM)).350 However, O2˙− was less harmful and could not react directly with cellular components, such as carbohydrates, lipids, peptides, and nucleic acids.351 Instead, it might be converted to the highly reactive ˙OH that was able to oxidize all organic cell constituents virtually. Levy et al.350 evaluated different ROS and pointed out that only O2˙− was suitable for application as a selective therapeutic or antimicrobial agent. Hence, O2˙− might be applied as the selective antimicrobial agent to inactivate certain enzymes rather than damage the cellular components indiscriminately.


7.2.4. 
            1O2. 
Despite the relatively low redox potential (0.81 V), 1O2 could induce the leakage and mineralization of intracellular components of E. coli, thus serving as the primary bactericidal agent.352 Furthermore, the 1O2-dominated oxidation system exhibited unparalleled inactivation performance in natural aquatic systems and maintained excellent reusability in the pilot-scale (25 L) reactor. Unlike the abovementioned radical species, 1O2 tended to damage proteins specifically, targeting the side chains of tyrosine, tryptophan, and cysteine.353 Additionally, 1O2 could also inactivate enzymes via the formation of protein peroxides, side-chain products, cross-links and aggregates, increased hydrophobicity, and the change of the binding with co-factors and metal ions.345

8. Concluding remarks and perspectives
Antibiotics are ubiquitously detected in natural environments, as well as the ARGs and ARB. Advanced oxidation processes capable of effectively destructing bacterial cells can serve as powerful supplements for the advanced treatment of effluents of WWTPs. In this review, we summarized various novel AOPs, such as H2O2, PMS, PDS, O3, PAA, permanganate, ferrate, and periodate induced AOPs. Additionally, as attractive candidates, the roles of metal-free catalysts including AC, CNTs, graphene-based materials, ND, PC, BC, g-C3N4, boron, and COFs are discussed in depth. The potential of metal-free catalyzed AOPs to eliminate antibiotics, ARB and ARGs is further explored. Although significant progress has been achieved, the following challenges still exist, which call for more efforts in future research:
(i) Most research is conducted at the laboratory scale rather than pilot scale, leading to the inaccuracy of the efficiencies of the catalysts and the corresponding AOPs. What cannot be ignored is that industrial wastewater usually contains various coexisting organics or/and inorganics, some of which are even unknown. Limited by the experiments, the influences of coexisting substances could not be fully understood. Therefore, a discount might appear when the established AOPs are applied in real industrial wastewater depending on their characteristics. Additionally, the operation mode of actual sewage treatment is quite different from that of the laboratory-scale reactor. Therefore, more efforts should be devoted to designing a catalytic oxidation reactor (e.g., membrane reactor and fixed-bed reactor) to realize continuous operation. Since the AOPs are usually applied as pretreatment methods, the variation of the biodegradability of wastewater (BOD/COD ratio) throughout the AOPs should also be considered as a critical indicator to reveal the effect of chemical oxidants on the subsequent biological treatment process.
(ii) During the carbocatalytic oxidation process, carbon-based catalysts often present a “catalyst poisoning” phenomenon, which can be reflected by the deteriorating reactivity. There are several possibilities for catalyst poisoning: (1) excessive intermediates are adsorbed on the active centers that cannot be completely degraded, thus shortening the life of the active centers; (2) chemical oxidation destroys not only the target contaminants but also oxidizes the active centers of the carbon catalysts. Nonetheless, the current researches primarily focus on the regeneration of the catalyst (e.g., solvent washing and secondary pyrolysis), while neglecting the stability of the catalyst. A systematic investigation of the underlying mechanism of the “catalyst poisoning” phenomenon is essential to propose a rational strategy. Compared with radical species, nonradical-dominated AOPs are much milder and more sustainable. However, the behavior of the catalyst itself during the nonradical-dominated AOPs is largely unknown. Metal-free catalysts are well accepted owing to their environmental friendliness (no metal-leaching risk and low secondary pollution) and biocompatibility, but they usually suffer from unsatisfactory reusability. The efficient regeneration of the catalyst is of great importance to cut down the operation cost of a heterogeneous AOP. Several reinforcement strategies (e.g., coating strategy or combination with an electric field) have already been proposed, and more desirable strategies are urgently needed in the future.
(iii) Despite intense researches, the intrinsic nature of the activation mechanism remains vaguely interpreted. For the well-recognized chemical quenching protocols, the diverse roles of radical scavengers are always largely overlooked. Though specific radical scavengers could rapidly quench reactive radicals, they might also directly consume oxidants considering the relatively higher concentrations of parent chemical oxidants than the steady-state concentrations of reactive radicals. Moreover, the sampling time-varying decay/transition of the spin-trapped adduct might deviate from the EPR signal intensity, making it difficult to precisely conduct a quantitative analysis of generated ROS (e.g., radicals and 1O2). Recently, it has been demonstrated that quenching agents will mislead the reaction mechanism of catalytic ozonation by interrupting the chain reaction of ozone attenuation, plugging up the active sites, and consuming large amounts of oxidants.354 Therefore, traditional quenching methods cannot honestly assess the relative contributions of ROS to the removal efficiency of contaminants. To this end, the methods and strategies for the mechanistic analysis should be reexamined based on the current knowledge and techniques. To be more specific, the reaction rate constants between representative chemical scavengers and radical species, as well as the parent oxidants, should be comprehensively explored prior to the chemical quenching studies. The roles of chemical scavengers in the oxidation reactions should be distinguishably identified and the contributions of radical species to the oxidation performance of organic contaminants should be carefully evaluated. Additionally, more powerful techniques, especially the in situ analysis methods, should be developed to more accurately reveal the activation mechanisms. For example, the electron-transfer regime induced by the carbocatalyst activated PDS/PMS process is somewhat equivocally limited by the analytical technique. Though some in situ techniques (i.e., ATR-FTIR, in situ Raman) were established to demonstrate the occurrence of the metastable high-potential complexes (e.g., C–PDS* and C–PMS*), the results and the reproductivity were usually unsatisfactory based on our massive attempts. A “lucky” result might not be able to really elucidate the electron-transfer regime.
(iv) Most existing research has focused on the removal efficiency of pollutants/microorganisms while identifying potentially toxic degradation/disinfection by-products is largely neglected. The non-selective reaction characteristics of free radicals and the occurrence of related side reactions may pose risks to ecosystems. Hence, the dosage of oxidants should be minimized through process optimization to offset the potential risks to the maximum extent.
