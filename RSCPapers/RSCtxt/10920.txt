    , Accepted 15th June 2014First published on 16th June 2014AbstractThree novel organic dyes, coded TK1, TK2 and TK3, incorporating two donor moieties, cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor/anchoring group, the dibenzofulvene core and an oligothiophene spacer in a 2D–π–A system, were designed, synthesized, and successfully utilized in dye-sensitized solar cells. The dye TK3, containing two thiophene rings as spacers, shows an IPCE action spectrum with a high plateau from 390 nm to 600 nm, increased open-circuit photovoltage by 40 mV and short-circuit photocurrent by 7.03 mA cm−1, with respect to TK1. Using CDCA as the co-adsorbent material, the Jsc of TK3 was increased to 14.98 mA cm−1 and a strong enhancement in the overall conversion efficiency (7.45%) was realized by TK3 compared to TK1 (1.08%), in liquid electrolyte-based DSSCs.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted a great deal of interest due to their potential of low cost production and the possibility to design new functional photoactive components to increase the solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency.1 Compared with traditional silicon solar cells, DSSCs offer major advantages as low cost materials, tunability of the absorption spectrum, and encouraging efficiency even under diffuse light. To date, DSSCs with a validated efficiency (η) record of >11% have been obtained with ruthenium complexes2 and porphyrin3 dyes. Enormous efforts are also being dedicated to developing efficient dyes suitable for their modest cost, ease of synthesis and functionalization, large molar extinction molar coefficient and long-stability. Metal-free dyes or organic dyes meet all these criteria. Many different organic dyes with conversion efficiencies in the range of 6–8%4 have been reported in the last few years but only a few examples have shown efficiencies over 10%.5
However, despite the progress, the optimization of the chemical structure of the organic components still needs further improvement. Most of the organic dyes used for highly efficient DSSCs have a long π-conjugated spacer between the donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties. Nevertheless, the introduction of long π-conjugated segments gives prolonged rod-like molecules, which may facilitate the recombination of electrons with triiodide and magnify aggregation between molecules.6 On the basis of such findings, recently, organic dyes with a 2D–π–A structure, where two D moieties are connected to a π-spacer, were reported.7 These studies suggested that organic dyes with the 2D–π–A structure may achieve better performance than the simple D-π-A structure.8
In this work, we present three novel sensitizers based on a 2D–π–A system, introducing the dibenzofulvene or fluorene-9-ylidene molecule as the central core, labelled as TK1, TK2 and TK3 (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Structures of the dyes. 
Fluorene derivatives have been intensively investigated as organic materials with advanced optical and electronic properties,9 due to their unique properties, such as coplanarity, highly ordered π-stacked structures and high charge density. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, organic sensitizers based on special derivatives of fluorene, such as dibenzofulvene (DBF), so far have not been satisfactorily explored for applications in DSSCs.10
In our strategy, we investigate the trend of the power conversion efficiency of 3,6-diarylamino-substituted dibenzofulvene-based sensitizers with the addition of thiophene rings at the 9-ylidene position. Substitution at 3,6 and 9 positions of the fluorene ensures an optimal π-conjugation through the fluorene skeleton, between the donor and acceptor units, making the compounds suitable for antenna-type systems in DSSC devices. We realized new 2D–π–A systems by introducing two units of diphenylamine as donor groups11 on the 3,6-positions of fluorene, and cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor group on the 9-position of fluorene, in TK1, and on thiophene and bithiophene spacers, in TK2 and TK3, respectively. This new architecture allowed us, in a few steps and with good yields, to obtain dyes with interesting device performances, achieving a very promising PCE value of 7.45% with TK3.
Experimental
Materials and instrumentation
All reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. All solvents were freshly distilled prior to use according to standard procedure. Commercial products were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer. LC-MS spectra were acquired with an Agilent 6300 Series Ion Trap interfaced with an Agilent 1200 HPLC adopting the following general conditions: atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, positive ions, eluent – chloroform, flow rate – 0.200 mL min−1, drying gas flow – 5.0 L min−1, nebulizer pressure – 60 psi, drying gas temperature – 350 °C, vaporizer temperature – 325 °C, mass range – 100–2200 m/z. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian-Cary 500 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter. The electrochemical characterization of the dyes was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using an AutoLab potentiostat (Methrom). A typical three-electrode cell was assembled with a glassy carbon disk working electrode, a Pt-wire auxiliary electrode, and an Ag/AgCl non-aqueous reference electrode. Cyclic voltammograms were acquired at a 0.1 V s−1 scan rate on 1 mM dye solutions prepared in the electrolyte solution which consisted of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluoroborate (TBAPF6) in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). All the solutions were previously degassed and a N2 atmosphere was maintained in the cell. Ferrocene was added as an internal reference for calibration of the potential scale versus the Fc+/Fc couple. Potentials referred to ferrocene were then converted to a Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE) by addition of 0.63 V.
Computational details
All calculations have been carried out with the TURBOMOLE12 program package using the COSMO solvation model.13 Ground state calculations and geometry optimizations were performed using the BLOC functional.14 Time-dependent calculations were carried out with the BHLYP functional.15 In all calculations a def2-TZVP basis set16 was employed. To quantify the charge-transfer character of each excited state two indicators were considered: the overlap indicator λ,17 which is computed as the spatial overlap between the occupied and unoccupied orbitals involved in the excitation; the electron displacement indicator Δr,18 which measures the distance between the ground-state and the excited-state charge distributions. We recall that small values of Λ (i.e. a small overlap between the occupied and unoccupied orbitals) indicate a greater charge-transfer character (when Λ = 0 an electron is completely transferred). In contrast, larger Δr values indicate a more pronounced charge transfer character.
Fabrication of DSSCs and photovoltaic measurements
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 15 Ω sq−1, provided by Solaronix S.A.) glass plates were first cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 15 min, and then rinsed with water and ethanol. Double-layer electrodes (overall thickness – 19 μm) were prepared as follows: a layer of commercial colloidal titania paste (Dyesol 18NR-T) was deposited onto the FTO glass and gradually heated in an oven in air to obtain an ∼14 μm transparent nano-crystalline film; the temperature gradient was programmed as follows: 170 °C (40 min), 350 °C (15 min) and 430 °C (30 min). This procedure was repeated for the scattering layer (5 μm) constituted by Solaronix D/SP colloidal paste. The double-layer electrode was eventually sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. The thickness and the active area (0.16 cm2) of the sintered photo-anodes were measured using a profilometer (Veeco Dektak 150 Surface Profiler). The dye loading was performed by keeping the electrodes in 0.2 mM AcCN:CH2Cl2 = 1:0.01 v/v solutions of TK1, TK2 and TK3 containing, where needed, a known amount of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) for 14 h under dark conditions. The counter-electrodes were prepared by sputtering a 50 nm Pt layer on a hole-drilled cleaned FTO plate. In a typical device construction procedure, the photo-anode and the counter-electrode were faced and assembled using a suitably cut 50 μm thick Surlyn® hot-melt gasket for sealing. The redox electrolyte (0.1 M LiI, 0.02 M I2, 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in dry acetonitrile) was vacuum injected into the space between the electrodes through pre-drilled holes on the back of the counter electrode. The holes were eventually sealed using the Surlyn® hot melt film and a cover glass. Photocurrent–voltage measurements were performed using a Keithley unit (Model 2400 Source Meter). A Newport AM 1.5 Solar Simulator (Model 91160A equipped with a 1000 W xenon arc lamp) served as a light source. The light intensity (or radiant power) was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Si solar cell as a reference. A mask with an aperture area of 0.25 cm2 was applied to the devices before measurements. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured by the DC method using a computer-controlled xenon arc lamp (Newport, 140 W, 67005) coupled with a monochromator (Newport Cornerstore 260 Oriel 74125). The light intensity was measured by a calibrated silicon UV-photodetector (Oriel 71675) and the short circuit currents of the DSSCs were measured by using a dual channel optical power/energy meter, (Newport 2936-C). The surface concentrations (dye loading) of the dyes were assessed by spectrophotometric determination as follows: double layered photoanodes (14 + 5 μm, 1 cm2) were sensitized with the same solutions used for devices; then the dyes were completely desorbed from the TiO2 surface by immersing the substrates in a 0.01 M tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in DMF solution. The evaluation of the dye concentration in the solvent, obtained by UV-Vis measurements, allowed estimation of the amount of the adsorbed molecules, expressed in terms of moles of dye anchored per projected unit area of the photoelectrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed by an AUTOLAB PGSTAT 302N (Eco Chemie B.V.) in a frequency range between 100 kHz and 10 mHz. The impedance measurements were carried out at different voltage biases under 1.0 sun illumination. The resulting impedance spectra were fitted by using ZView (Scribner Associates) software.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of the materials
The new dibenzofulvene-based (TK) organic dyes are shown in Fig. 1, and the main synthetic pathways are depicted in Scheme 1. Compound 2 was synthesized by a C–N cross-coupling reaction between compound 119 with 2.2 equivalents of diphenylamine, in the presence of Pd(dba)2 (dba = dibenzylideneacetone) and P(tBu)3,20 in a microwave reactor. TK1 was prepared via Knoevenagel condensation of 2 with cyanoacetic acid, in the presence of TiCl4.21 Compound 3 was obtained by reduction reaction of the keto group of 2 by addition of borane-tert-butylamine and anhydrous AlCl3. Then, the resulting product 3 was condensed with thiophene-2,5-dicarbaldehyde and 2,2′-bithiophene-5,5′-dicarbaldehyde (5) in the presence of KOtBu to obtain the compounds 4 and 6, respectively. Finally, the organic dyes TK2 and TK3 were obtained via Knoevenagel condensation of cyanoacetic acid with the aldehydes 4 and 6, respectively, using ammonium acetate.

Photophysical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the dyes in CH2Cl2 solution (ca. 10−5 M) are shown in Fig. 2. Absorption data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, TK1 displays the maximum absorption peak at 449 nm. The incorporation of one thiophene ring as a spacer between the DBF core and the acceptor units leads to sensitizer TK2, inducing a significant bathochromic shift of 73 nm, as well as an increased absorption intensity. The TK3 is obtained by introduction of a second thiophene ring, its maximum absorption is centered at 485 nm and shows a significant increase in the molar extinction coefficient (ε = 1.7 × 104 M−1 cm−1).

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the dye-loaded TiO2 films (∼7 μm), shown in Fig. 2 (right), display the same trend for the absorption maxima as those for the absorption in solution. TK1 displays a hypsochromically shifted absorption maximum (22 nm) in the film on TiO2 with respect to the solution λmax. This phenomenon has been observed for most of the organic sensitizers and it is due to the deprotonation of the cyanoacrylic acid group.22
On the other hand, upon adsorption onto the nanocrystalline TiO2 surface, a small (∼5 nm) or negligible shift in the absorption maximum can be observed for TK3 and TK2, respectively. At the same time, a beneficial broadening of the absorption bands improves light-harvesting and a short-circuit current enhancement is also expected.
Electrochemical properties
The cyclic voltammograms of the dyes are shown in the ESI (Fig. S1†) and the relevant electrochemical data are presented in Table 1. The first oxidation potentials, corresponding to the HOMO energy levels of the TK, were determined to be 4.99, −5.08 and −5.35, respectively for TK3, TK2 and TK1. These values corresponded to 0.94, 1.03 and 1.29 vs. NHE, respectively, which are more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3−redox couple (0.4 V vs. NHE), indicating that reduction of the oxidized dyes with I− ions is thermodynamically feasible. The excited state (E*0–0) of the sensitizer was estimated from the difference between the first oxidation potential and the zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0) derived from the absorption onset.
The more negative excited state oxidation potential of TK dyes (E*0–0, −0.89 to −1.14 V vs. NHE) than the conduction band-edge level of the TiO2 electrode (−0.5 vs. NHE)23 ensures the electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2.
Theoretical approach
To further study the electronic and optical properties of the dyes we performed density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD) DFT calculations. The TD-DFT results are in good agreement with the experimental spectra and show that the broad absorption bands observed in solution in fact consist of several singlet excitations (Table 2 and Fig. 3). All the excitations are described by single-particle transitions from the lowest occupied orbitals to the higher unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and have a substantial charge-transfer character. This fact is indicated by the inspection of the orbitals' isodensity plots (Fig. 4) as well as from the values of the indicators Λ(ref. 17) and Δr.18 In particular, the latter shows that the photoinduced charge separation increases consistently in the series TK1–TK2–TK3 (Δr = 2.39, 5.12, and 5.95 Å respectively), indicating the positive effect of thiophene insertion in the spacer.

The inclusion of thiophene units was also found to have an effect on the ionization potential and electron affinity, causing a reduction of the former and an increase of the latter (Table 3), possibly because of the induced increase of π-conjugation. We remark that this finding correlates well with the computed reduction in the optical gap going from TK1 to TK3. Furthermore, the trend was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (see Table 1 and Fig. S1 in the ESI†).

The power conversion efficiencies of the devices based on TK1, TK2 and TK3 dyes are 2.1%, 5.0% and 5.4%, respectively. This enhancement is mainly attributed to an increase in Jsc, from 4.52 mA cm−2 of the TK1 dye to 10.85 and 11.55 mA cm−2 achieved with the TK2 and TK3 dyes, respectively. The IPCE spectra, shown in Fig. 5, partially explain what happens: the TK1-based device presents a lower photoresponse showing a maximum of ∼20% at 430 nm compared to the plateau of ∼50% in the 450–550 nm region obtained for the TK2 and TK3-based devices, in good accordance with the absorption spectra.
An estimation of the dye loading for TK1, TK2 and TK3 revealed that the amount of adsorbed TK1 is lower compared to TK2 and TK3. The bulkier molecular structure of TK1 reasonably hampers the access to adsorption sites with respect to the TK2 and TK3 sensitizers, providing an explanation for the lower efficiencies, ascribable to the increased probability of detrimental charge recombination processes.
To further investigate the relationship between the molecular structure and photovoltaic performance, the capacitance (Cmeas, Fig. 6), the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (Rct, Fig. 6) and the electron lifetime (Fig. 7) were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Since all devices were fabricated and tested under the same conditions, only the differences in the molecular structure of the sensitizers influenced the electrochemical parameters.
 Fig. 6  Measured capacitance as a function of the corrected potential (left). Charge transfer resistance as a function of the corrected potential (right). 
 Fig. 7  Apparent electron lifetime as a function of the corrected potential. 
A lower Rct was found for the TK1-based device indicating that injected electrons are easily subjected to recombination with the oxidized form of the sensitizer or with the redox species present in the electrolyte. The extension of the π-bridge through the introduction of one or two thienyl moieties was helpful to increase the interfacial resistance, as also indicated by the higher Voc value (Table 4), suggesting that a larger amount of photo-generated electrons can reach the contact, justifying the higher photocurrent.
The apparent electron lifetime (Fig. 7) of TK1 is remarkably shorter than those of TK2 and TK3 dyes, which further confirms that injected electrons from TK1 undergo an easier recombination.
Due to the high planarity of the sensitizers, favored by the presence of the DBF core, a fast intramolecular charge transfer is expected as well as an unfavourable π–π stacking which may lead to recombination phenomena. For this reason the use of CDCA as a co-adsorbent was implemented.
The performances of the CDCA co-sensitized devices yielded 1.1%, 4.72% and 7.45% efficiencies for TK1, TK2 and TK3 dyes, respectively showing a remarkable improvement for the TK3 dye.
These results could be explained considering that the co-adsorbent CDCA minimizes the detrimental dye aggregation of planar sensitizers but reduces the dye up-take by competing with the dye for binding at the TiO2 surface.
In the case of the TK1 dye, due to its higher steric hindrance, CDCA lowers the performances of the device because it unfavorably competes with the sensitizer. On the other hand, for the TK3 dye, the lowering of the dye coverage is well counterbalanced by the reduction of the π–π stacking and thus of the intermolecular quenching, leading to higher photovoltaic performances (η = 7.45%, FF = 0.71, Voc = 0.70 V, Jsc = 14.98 mA cm−2) (Fig. 8).

Conclusions
In summary, three novel dibenzofulvene-centered sensitizers (TK1, TK2 and TK3) with different thiophene units have been designed and successfully synthesized. The molecular design strategy used here can effectively improve the efficiency of solar conversion which is generally determined by light harvesting efficiency, electron injection efficiency, and reduction of the charge recombination phenomena. DSSCs using these sensitizers exhibited efficiencies of 2.14–5.42% under AM 1.5 illumination. Upon adding CDCA as a co-adsorbent, an energy conversion efficiency as high as 7.45% was achieved with the TK3 dye.
Our further research on broadening the absorption spectra to the infrared region through molecular engineering or co-sensitization is underway.
