    , Accepted 13th March 2015First published on 13th March 2015AbstractThe performance of organic solar cells is substantially enhanced by introducing high-mobility conjugate polymers as additives for the first time. The most pronounced effect is observed in one type of device with the average power conversion efficiencies increased from 8.75% to 10.08% after the addition of a high-mobility polymer for only 0.5 weight percent in the active layers, which is mainly attributed to the increased hole mobility and carrier lifetime in the devices. Besides the hole mobility, the energy band structure of the additive is also found to be critical to the enhancement of the device performance. This work demonstrates a novel approach for improving the efficiencies of organic solar cells.

Broader context
Organic solar cells have attracted much attention recently for their easy fabrication, low cost, solution processability and mechanical flexibility. However, the efficiencies of organic solar cells are still much lower than that of a commercialized solar cell. Therefore, effective techniques for improving the efficiencies of organic solar cells are urgently needed. Here, we report a novel technique for improving the efficiencies of organic solar cells by introducing a high-mobility conjugated polymer as an additive for the first time. Under optimum conditions, the efficiencies of one type of organic solar cell can be improved from 8.75% to 10.08%, which is mainly attributed to the improved hole mobilities in the devices. We also find that, besides the high hole mobility, the band structure of the conjugated polymer is critical to the efficiency enhancement because the energy levels of the molecular orbitals can influence carrier recombination and lifetimes in the devices. The technique is convenient and cost effective since there are plenty of choices in using high-mobility polymers. This work paves the way for realizing high-performance organic solar cells in the near future.

Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted much attention recently in virtue of their advantages, including light weight, low cost, mechanical flexibility and easy fabrication, over conventional solar cells.1–5 One of the most concerned and critical issues of OPVs for commercialization is the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices. Nowadays, lots of strategies have been developed to enhance the PCEs of OPVs based on different principles, such as the introduction of buffer layers,6–9 additives,10–14 nanoparticles with a surface plasmon resonance effect,15–19 tandem architecture,20–22etc. with a view to enhance the light absorption and tuning of the energy band structure of the devices.
One limitation of many high-efficiency OPVs, such as the representative devices based on polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7) and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM),23,24 is the low hole mobilities in the devices, which prohibit the further improvement of the device performance. A reasonable approach to overcome this limitation is to introduce high-mobility materials as additives in the active layers. For example, carbon nanotubes were added in OPVs to facilitate charge transport and improve PCEs of the devices successfully.25,26 Considering some recently reported high-mobility polymers exhibiting carrier mobilities several orders of magnitude higher than those of OPVs, a similar effect would be expected if the high-mobility polymers were added in the active layers, which however has never been reported before. On the other hand, it has been recognized that ternary blend solar cells with two donor materials may have higher efficiencies due to enhanced light absorption, improved charge separation and carrier transport, and suppressed carrier recombination for the cascade band structure in the active layers.27–30 Therefore, the addition of another high-mobility polymer with a suitable band structure in an OPV would be a promising strategy for improving the device efficiency.
In this paper, we try to improve the PCEs of OPVs by adding suitable high-mobility polymers, including alkyldiketopyrrolo-pyrrole and dithienylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DPP-DTT) and poly[2,5-bis(alkyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione-alt-5,5′-di(thiophene-2-yl)-2,2′-(E)-2-(2-(thiophen-2-yl)vinyl)thiophene] (PDVT-10),31,32 which have hole mobilities (∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1) about four orders of magnitude higher than those of conventional OPVs. We find that the addition of a little amount of DPP-DTT (1 wt%) can lead to a significant increase of the PCE of PTB7/PC71BM-based OPVs from 7.58% to 8.33%, which is mainly due to the remarkable increase in the hole mobilities of the devices. In addition, DPP-DTT could enhance the light absorption of the OPVs in the wavelength region longer than 700 nm, as indicated by the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices and the UV-visible absorption spectra of the DPP-DTT polymer. Similarly, the average efficiency of the OPVs based on poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PBDTTT-EFT) and PC71BM can be improved from 8.75% to 10.08% by adding the high mobility polymer PDVT-10.33 The key issue in choosing a suitable high-mobility polymer here is to have the similar HOMO levels of the high-mobility polymer and the polymer donor in OPVs, which can lead to a pronounced enhancement of the hole mobility in the devices.
The experimental section is presented in the ESI.† We firstly fabricated ternary OPVs based on PTB7 + DPP-DTT/PC71BM with the device structure shown in Fig. 1 by a solution process on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass, in which DPP-DTT was added in the active layer only at low percentage. The high-mobility DPP-DTT polymer contains a conjugated acceptor moiety and a comparatively stronger donor moiety.31 The corresponding energy diagram of the device is shown in Fig. 2a. All of the energy levels of PTB7, PC71BM and DPP-DTT chosen from the literature were determined by the cyclic voltammetry method.21,31 It is notable that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of PTB7 and DPP-DTT are very close and the energy difference is only ∼50 mV, which is close to the product of the Boltzmann constant k and the room temperature T (kT ∼ 26 mV, for T = 300 K). On the other hand, the distribution of the density of states of the HOMO level in a conjugated polymer is normally within 100 mV.34 So holes can transport in the mixture of the two polymers.

(c) The PCE and the corresponding enhancement for different DPP-DTT percentage. (d) EQEs of the OPVs with different DPP-DTT percentage. Inset: EQEs in the wavelength region from 750 to 1000 nm. 
The light absorption peak of DPP-DTT appears at around 825 nm while PTB7/PC71BM can absorb light only below 750 nm (see the ESI,† Fig. S1). The light absorption in the near infrared region from 750 nm to 900 nm of PTB7/PC71BM added to DPP-DTT increases with the increase in DPP-DTT percentage. Therefore, PTB7 and DPP-DTT fit very well in terms of their complementary light absorption.

Fig. 2a shows the current density versus bias voltage (J–V) curves of the OPVs added to DPP-DTT with different percentage. Here, the active layer thicknesses of all OPVs were controlled to be ∼90 nm, which is the optimum thickness of this type of OPV (see the ESI,† Fig. S2).24 The weight ratio of the p-type (i.e. PTB7 + DPP-DTT) to the n-type (i.e. PC71BM) semiconductors was kept at 1:1.5. The weight percentages of the added DPP-DTT relative to PTB7 were controlled to be 0.5%, 1%, 2.5% and 5%, respectively. To evaluate the effect of the additive, PTB7/PC71BM and DPP-DTT/PC71BM binary control devices were also fabricated and characterized under the same conditions. Under each condition, at least three devices were fabricated to calculate the average PCEs. Detailed photovoltaic performance including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), average PCE and PCE enhancement relative to the PTB7/PC71BM control devices are summarized in Fig. 2b and c and Table S1 in the ESI.†
The PTB7/PC71BM control devices give an average Voc of 0.745 V, Jsc of 14.4 mA cm−2, FF of 71.1% and an average PCE of 7.58%, which are comparable with the performance in the literature.23 After being added to 0.5 wt% DPP-DTT polymer in the photoactive layer, the devices show the average Voc, Jsc, and FF of 0.740 V, 16.0 mA cm−2, and 68.2%, respectively, which result in an obvious increase of the average PCE to 8.08%. For the devices added to 1.0 wt% DPP-DTT, more significant improvement of PCEs (8.33 ± 0.13%) can be observed, which resulted from the increases in Jsc (15.8 mA cm−2) and Voc (0.762 V). It is notable that the PCE enhancement relative to the control devices is 9.9 ± 1.8%. However, a further increase of the amount of DPP-DTT added to 2.5 wt% and 5 wt% leads to the decrease of PCEs to around 7.79% and 7.42% on average, respectively, mainly due to the obvious decrease in Jsc of the devices. The decreasing efficiency with the increase of DPP-DTT percentage when it is higher than 1% is also consistent with the performance of the control device based on DPP-DTT/PC71BM, which shows the PCE to be only 2.3% as presented in Fig. 2a. Therefore, the optimum amount of DPP-DTT added in the ternary OPVs is around 1 wt%. Compared with other ternary OPVs reported recently,27–30,35 the DPP-DTT additive shows a pronounced effect at a weight percentage of only 1 wt%, which is much more effective in modulating the efficiency of OPVs than other materials.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements of the OPVs were subsequently conducted to better illuminate the enhancement of the device performance. As shown in Fig. 2d, the control device without the additive exhibits the maximum EQE of 63.2%, while the others added to 0.5 wt% and 1 wt% DPP-DTT into the active layers show the maximum EQEs of 67.6% and 68.0%, respectively. The improvement of EQE can be observed in the whole characterized wavelength region. However, addition of more DPP-DTT (2.5 wt% and 5 wt%) inversely decreases EQE in the wavelength region between 350 nm and 700 nm and the control device of DPP-DTT/PC71BM shows the lowest EQE in this region.
The enhancement of EQE beyond a wavelength of 750 nm, as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2d, can be ascribed to the light absorption of DPP-DTT in this wavelength region. So it is reasonable to find that the EQE value in this region increases with the increase in the additive amount. But this effect is obviously not the main reason for the increase of PCE in the devices. Besides light absorption, exciton dissociation and carrier recombination/transport in the active layers are also critical issues to the performance of OPVs, which will be studied next to better understand the PCE enhancement due to DPP-DTT.
Firstly, to characterize the influence of DPP-DTT on carrier transport in the OPVs, hole-only devices with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend layer/Au and electron-only devices with the structure ITO/ZnO/blend layer/Al were prepared (see ESI†). To avoid leakage induced by impurities or pinholes in the active layers, the thicknesses of the blend layers were controlled to be 250–300 nm. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, electron and hole currents versus bias voltage were characterized in the devices with different percentage of DPP-DTT. The curves can be fitted very well with the space charge limited currents (SCLCs) given by the Murgatroyd equation.36,37 As shown in Fig. 3c, the calculated electron and hole mobilities change with the amount of DPP-DTT. It is interesting to notice that the hole mobility increases with the increase of the DPP-DTT percentage, which is reasonable because of the high hole mobility of DPP-DTT. However, the electron mobility decreases with the increase of DPP-DTT amount and shows a similar value of hole mobility when the DPP-DTT percentage is around 1wt%. From the device physics point of view, the equivalent electron and hole mobilities are favourable for charge transport in the OPVs, which is one of the main reasons for the highest PCE obtained at 1 wt% DPP-DTT addition.30,38

(c) Electron and hole mobilities calculated from the space charge limited currents (SCLCs) in (a) and (b). 
To better understand the decrease of electron mobility with the addition of DPP-DTT, the blend films with the same thickness of around 300 nm were characterized by Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXD, Regaku 9KW SmartLAB).39 As shown in Fig. 4a, the out-of-plane diffraction peaks for pure PC71BM and PTB7 films can be observed. The PTB7 film shows a peak at q = 1.6 Å−1, corresponding to the lattice plane (010).27 The amorphous PC71BM shows three broad peaks (q = 0.70, 1.3 and 1.9 Å−1) originating from the superposition of several peaks for different lattice planes.28 In the following discussion, the main peak at q = 1.3 Å−1 is taken as a measure for the crystallization degree of PC71BM. As shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI,† both peaks can be fitted very well with the Lorentz function. The peak widths w are 0.252 Å−1 and 0.357 Å−1 for PC71BM (q = 1.3 Å−1) and PTB7 (q = 1.6 Å−1), respectively.

(c) Peak widths of the diffraction peaks at q = 1.3 Å−1 for different DPP-DTT percentage. (d) Carrier lifetimes of different devices as a function of bias voltage. 

Fig. 4b shows the diffraction peaks of the blend films with different weight percentage of DPP-DTT. We fitted the GIXD curves with the three Lorentz peaks (two for PC71BM and one for PTB7) in the region 1.0 Å−1 ≤ q ≤ 2.1 Å−1, as shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† The peak width of PC71BM at q = 1.3 Å−1 shown in Fig. 4c increases with the increasing addition of DPP-DTT and the DPP-DTT/PC71BM film shows the highest width of 0.482 Å−1. So the addition of DPP-DTT can damage the crystallinity of PC71BM and consequently decrease the electron mobility in the device.
Moreover, we measured the surface roughness of the PTB7 + DPP-DTT/PC71BM films with different addition levels prepared under the same conditions of OPVs. As shown in Fig. S5 and Table S2 in the ESI,† the surface roughness decreases with the increase of the addition level, indicating that DPP-DTT can inhibit the crystallization in the active layers, being consistent with the morphology change observed in other ternary OPVs.30,40
Secondly, the donor/acceptor interface properties are critical to exciton dissociation and carrier recombination in OPVs. It has been reported that the DPP-DTT/PC71BM interface is not ideal for exciton dissociation due to the small energy offset between their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels.41 As shown in Fig. 2a, the LUMO levels for DPP-DTT and PC71BM are 3.5 eV and 3.7 eV,21,31 respectively. The energy difference between the two LUMO levels is about 0.2 eV, which is lower than the required value (normally 0.3–0.4 eV) for efficient exciton dissociation at an organic heterojunction.41 The poor exciton dissociation can also be reflected by the low EQE of the DPP-DTT/PC71BM control device shown in Fig. 2d.
On the other hand, the ternary OPVs have a cascade band structure, which is favourable for prohibiting carrier recombination in the devices, as discussed, for example, by Lu et al.27 To characterize the geminate carrier recombination process at the donor/acceptor interface, the impedance of the OPVs was measured using an impedance analyzer (HP4294) at different bias voltages in the dark (see the ESI,† Fig. S6) and the carrier lifetime can be decided from the top position of each Nyquist plot of the impedance.42Fig. 4d shows the carrier lifetime as a function of bias voltage for different DPP-DTT addition levels. The carrier lifetime decreases with the increase of bias voltage due to the increasing carrier density at the heterojunction.37,43 For different samples at the same bias voltage, the longest carrier lifetime appears upon the addition of 1 wt% DPP-DTT. Upon addition of more DPP-DTT, the carrier lifetime is decreased, which however is not expected in the devices with the cascade band structure. It is notable that the carrier lifetime in DPP-DTT/PC71BM is much shorter than that in PTB7/PC71BM at the same bias voltage. Therefore the carriers can more easily recombine at the interface of DPP-DTT/PC71BM, which is the main reason for the decreased carrier lifetime with the increased addition of DPP-DTT higher than 1 wt%. Considering that the Voc of an OPV decreases with the increase of the carrier recombination rate at the heterojunction,43,44 the longest carrier lifetime at the DPP-DTT addition level of 1 wt% can also be confirmed by the highest Voc at this addition level shown in Fig. 2b. Therefore, DPP-DTT can influence the carrier recombination process in the ternary OPVs by two ways. One is to prohibit the recombination of free electrons and holes due to the cascade band structure and another one is to accelerate the carrier recombination at the DPP-DTT/PC71BM interface. The compromise of the two effects results in the optimum amount of the additive of ∼1 wt%.
To check the effect of other high-mobility polymers, we introduced another DPP-based high-mobility copolymer PDVT-10 in PTB7/PC71BM-based OPVs. PDVT-10 shows high hole mobilities up to 8.2 cm2 V−1 s−1,32 being comparable to that of DPP-DTT. However, the HOMO level of PDVT-10 is 5.28 eV, which is ∼130 mV higher than that of PTB7.32 The band structure of the ternary OPV is shown in the inset of Fig. S7 in the ESI.† We find that the PCEs of the devices decrease with the increasing amount of PDVT-10 and a little efficiency enhancement can be observed only upon the addition of percentage of 0.5 wt%, as shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI.† To better understand the effect, we have characterized the carrier mobilities in the films with different addition percentage (0.5%, 1%, 2.5%, 5%) by SCLC measurements. As shown in Fig. S8 in the ESI,† the hole mobility exhibits little change while the electron mobility decreases rapidly with the increase of the added amount. It is notable that the HOMO levels of PTB7 and PDVT-10 have an energy difference of about 130 mV. Therefore, holes in PDVT-10 tend to move to PTB7 due to decreased energies and thus the hole mobility in the blend film cannot be increased by PDVT-10 for too much value. On the other hand, electron mobilities of the OPVs are decreased by the additive. So the addition of PDVT-10 decreases the efficiency of the OPVs monotonically with the added amount.
To further confirm the generality of the approach, another type of OPV based on PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM was fabricated with the addition of the high mobility polymers DPP-DTT and PDVT-10. PBDTTT-EFT has a broader light absorption region than PTB7 and its HUMO level is 5.24 eV.45 So the HOMO levels of both PDVT-10 and DPP-DTT are very close to that of PBDTTT-EFT. Fig. 5a and b show the J–V curves and the PCEs of the OPVs with the addition of DPP-DTT of different amount. It is interesting to note that DPP-DTT cannot induce any improvement of the device efficiency although the short circuit current is improved. As shown in the inset of Fig. 5a, the addition of DPP-DTT in the PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM blend films cannot form a cascade band structure, which is the major reason for the lack of PCE enhancement in the devices.

(b) The PCEs of the devices based on PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM with different DPP-DTT percentage. (c) J–V characteristics of OPVs with different percentage of PDVT-10 added in PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM.

(d) The PCEs and the corresponding enhancement for the devices based on PBDTTT-EFT+PDVT-10/PC71BM with different PDVT-10 percentage. 

Fig. 5c and d show the J–V curves and the PCEs of the OPVs based on PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM with the addition of PDVT-10 of different percentage. The detailed data are provided in Table S3 in the ESI.† A dramatic enhancement in the PCEs of the devices can be observed and the optimum addition level of PDVT-10 is 0.5 wt%. The average PCE was enhanced from 8.75% to 10.08% in this addition level and the corresponding relative enhancement is 15.2%. The champion device shows a PCE of 10.14%, which is 15.9% higher than that of the control devices without the additive. The enhancement can be obviously attributed to the enhanced hole mobility (see the ESI,† Fig. S9) as well as the cascade band structure of the ternary OPVs shown in the inset of Fig. 5c, which can prohibit geminate carrier recombination (see Fig. S10 in the ESI†). Therefore, for PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM, PDVT-10 is a more suitable additive than DPP-DTT due to the matchable energy levels of the former one. It is notable that the device performance is very sensitive to the HOMO levels of the organic semiconductors since a HOMO energy difference of ∼80 mV between DPP-DTT and PDVT-10 can lead to completely different effects. The above explanation is based on the assumption that the energy levels in the literature are accurate enough. However, the standard errors of the energy levels are unknown and the energy levels can be finely tuned by other factors like the crystallinity and strain of the polymer films.46 Therefore, precise simulation of the effect is not possible at this stage although all of the results can be reasonably explained.
Conclusions
In summary, the efficiencies of OPVs are substantially improved by adding a suitable high-mobility polymer in the active layer. For PTB7/PC71BM OPVs, the average PCE is improved from 7.58% to 8.33% by adding 1 wt% DPP-DTT and obvious improvements of EQEs over a broad wavelength range from 350 to 800 nm can be observed. For the OPVs based on PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM, PDVT-10 is a more suitable additive. The average PCE is increased from 8.75% to 10.08% at an addition level of 0.5 wt%. The significant enhancement of the PCEs can be attributed to the increased hole mobilities and carrier lifetimes of the devices. To effectively increase the hole mobilities of the devices, we find that the additive should have a similar HOMO level to that of the donor material. As evidenced in our experiments, several tens of millivolts may lead to a completely different effect. Secondly, the additive should form a cascade band structure in the OPVs to avoid the trapping of carriers in the additive. On the other hand, the additive may induce several drawbacks, including the decreased electron mobility and lower exciton dissociation efficiency at the heterojunction. Given the aforementioned drawbacks are overcome via rational material design and processing control, a better effect of adding high mobility conjugated polymers in OPVs would be expected in the future. Therefore, this work demonstrates a novel approach for improving the performance of OPVs by adding high-mobility polymers.

Broader context
Organic solar cells have attracted much attention recently for their easy fabrication, low cost, solution processability and mechanical flexibility. However, the efficiencies of organic solar cells are still much lower than that of a commercialized solar cell. Therefore, effective techniques for improving the efficiencies of organic solar cells are urgently needed. Here, we report a novel technique for improving the efficiencies of organic solar cells by introducing a high-mobility conjugated polymer as an additive for the first time. Under optimum conditions, the efficiencies of one type of organic solar cell can be improved from 8.75% to 10.08%, which is mainly attributed to the improved hole mobilities in the devices. We also find that, besides the high hole mobility, the band structure of the conjugated polymer is critical to the efficiency enhancement because the energy levels of the molecular orbitals can influence carrier recombination and lifetimes in the devices. The technique is convenient and cost effective since there are plenty of choices in using high-mobility polymers. This work paves the way for realizing high-performance organic solar cells in the near future.
