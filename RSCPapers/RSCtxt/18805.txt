    , Accepted 23rd April 2012First published on 15th May 2012AbstractTiO2 anatase nanorods were grown via the non-hydrolytic elimination reaction between TiCl4 and Ti(OiPr)4 in the presence of oleic acid. The reaction was carried out in two stages in order to separate TiOx seed nucleation at lower temperatures from nanorod growth at higher temperatures. This separation made it possible to study the crystal growth mechanism in more detail, indicating that nanorod formation occurred through a combination of atom-by-atom addition and oriented attachment of the initial seeds. The two-stage reaction approach also enabled considerably improved control of titania nanorod formation in terms of product morphology, crystallinity and uniformity. The effects of a range of reaction parameters, including reaction duration, temperature, dilution and stoichiometry, were investigated.
Introduction
Nanoscale titanium dioxide (TiO2) is as an important technological material,1 exploited in an increasing variety of applications, including dye-sensitised solar cells,2 photocatalysis,3 sensors,4 and photochromic devices.5 Rod-shaped titania nanostructures are of particular interest for their ability to form, potentially anisotropic, open (accessible) connected networks and other geometric characteristics.6 Rod-like morphology offers a higher surface-to-volume ratio compared to nanospheres (at fixed particle volume) that can increase the density of active surface sites for photocatalytic reactions or load transfer in composites. In addition, in principle, charge carrier mobility can be improved along the length of single-crystalline rods, potentially leading to reduced electron–hole recombination and more efficient charge separation, especially if scattering due to defect or surface states is minimised.7 For these reasons, TiO2 nanorods are particularly interesting for optoelectronic applications, such as photovoltaic devices and self-powered UV detectors. Superior photoconduction efficiencies and gains have been experimentally demonstrated for individual, single-crystalline TiO2 nanorods.8,9 However, it has also been shown that charge transport in the TiO2 nanorod:polymer blend films can be limited by the presence of an intrinsic trap distribution mainly associated with the TiO2 particles.10 Crystallite and surface morphology are important parameters in this context. Interfacial phenomena, for example related to the modification of polymer crystallinity induced at the interface to TiO2 nanorods11 or the influence of the organic ligand at the nanorod surface,10,12 are known to play a crucial role in efficient charge separation. For instance, the electron-collecting properties of TiO2 nanorod films were markedly improved after simple UV-irradiation to modify the surface chemistry.13 Consequently, TiO2 nanorods have been successfully utilised in optoelectronic devices. Hybrid photovoltaic devices based on dye-sensitised TiO2 nanorods were shown to exhibit power conversion efficiencies up to 2.2%, by suppressing charge recombination at the donor/acceptor surface.12,14 Another example is the use of multilayer TiO2 nanorod electrodes in dye sensitised solar cells and self-powered UV-detectors with high quantum efficiencies.15
Synthetic strategies for the preparation of titania nanorods, include metal–organic chemical vapour deposition,16 electrochemical anodisation,17 direct oxidation of titanium sheets,18 and solution-phase reactions in hydrolytic19–21 and non-hydrolytic environments.22–24 Non-hydrolytic syntheses are particularly attractive as they enable controlled reactions at higher temperatures, yielding titania nanostructures of high crystallinity and organic surface termination relevant to solution processed devices. Typically, non-hydrolytic titania synthesis involves organic titanium compounds, such titanium alkoxides and/or titanium halides, in a non-aqueous medium. Anisotropic, rod-like morphologies can be obtained through the addition of simple organic surfactants, often referred to as structure directing agents (SDA), such as carboxylic acids or amines.3,25 The non-hydrolytic synthesis of titania nanorods from organic titanium reactants is complex and involves several, concurrent steps. During the initial phase of the reaction, the titanium compounds and SDA form metal oxide precursor complexes that react with each other to form small TiOx clusters.21 At high reaction temperatures or in the presence of base catalysts, crystallisation into faceted anatase particles occurs readily. The formation of nanorods from these primary nuclei can occur via two modes: classical, preferential crystal growth, i.e. atom-by-atom addition to an existing crystalline core along a preferred crystallographic direction,26 or oriented attachment, i.e. the aggregation and fusion of the primary particles along a specific, common crystal facet. In the case of preferential atom-by-atom crystal growth, high concentrations of stable, SDA-capped metal oxide precursors promote kinetic processes, driving growth along the high energy crystallographic direction;21,26 the selective adhesion of SDA molecules to specific facets of the primary, crystalline cores can further enhance anisotropic crystal growth.3,24,27,28 In the case of oriented attachment, the primary nanocrystals reduce their overall surface energy by preferentially fusing along the crystal facet with the highest surface energy, a process that can also be facilitated by facet selective adhesion of the SDA molecules.20,29–33
Examples of non-hydrolytic titania nanorod synthesis include the alkyl halide elimination reaction between titanium tetrachloride and titanium isopropoxide in the presence of lauric acid as the SDA and trioctylphosphine oxide as a nonselective surfactant,24 the ester elimination reaction between titanium isopropoxide and oleic acid,3 and the ester aminolysis of titanium oleate complexes.34 However, these approaches often yield highly polydispersed samples with a wide distribution of nanorod lengths and diameters. Improved nanorod quality, in terms of aspect ratio, crystallinity and size distribution, is desirable and likely lead to enhanced device performances. The optimization of various reaction parameters, e.g. the stoichiometry of titanium precursors and SDAs, has been explored towards this aim.24 It has also been shown that the injection rate of the organic precursors has a marked effect on the aspect ratio of the nanostructure.34,35 In this paper, we introduce a new non-hydrolytic approach based on the separation of the nucleation and growth phase, thereby allowing improved control of the morphology, crystallinity and monodispersity of the synthesised products. For this purpose, we have investigated the non-hydrolytic reaction of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and titanium isopropoxide (TTIP), in the presence of oleic acid acting as structure directing agent.26,35 The nominal overall reaction is:  
The reaction was performed in one-pot but in two distinctive stages: a first low-temperature stage at 110 °C, where the nucleation of the primary particles is initiated but crystallisation is likely to be inhibited, was followed by a high-temperature stage at around 300 °C, where crystal growth can occur. Several reaction parameters were explored, in order to investigate the underlying growth mechanism and identify the optimum parameters for the formation of high-quality titania nanorods.
Experimental
Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4, 98%, Fluka), heptadecane (C17H36, 98%, Fluka), titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti(OiPr)4, TTIP, 97%, Aldrich) and oleic acid (C18H33CO2H, 90%, Aldrich) were used as received without further purification. All reactions were carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. In a typical experiment (Reaction 3 in Table 1), oleic acid (30 mmol) was first dried under vacuum at 110 °C for an hour. The flask was then flushed with nitrogen. Heptadecane (7.5 mL, 24 mmol) was added, followed by TiCl4 (1.10 mL, 10 mmol), and TTIP (0.98 mL, 3.3 mmol). This mixture was subsequently refluxed at 110 °C for four hours (low-temperature stage). The temperature was then raised to 300 °C and, after about 15 min, additional TTIP (1.96 mL, 6.6 mmol) was injected rapidly (at an injection rate of around 1 mL min−1) into the hot solution; the mixture was subsequently stirred vigorously for four hours (high-temperature stage). Note that, in all experiments except Reactions 1 and 2, TTIP was added in 3.3 mmol aliquots at the beginning of the low-temperature reaction phase (in order to initiate nucleation) and in 6.6 mmol aliquots at the start of the high-temperature phase (in order to provide feedstock for crystal growth). Due to its pronounced volatility and reactivity at high temperatures, this addition procedure was not feasible for TiCl4. Consequently, all of the TiCl4 (10 mmol) was added at the start of the low-temperature stage. After the reaction, the product was washed three times with propan-2-ol in order to remove unreacted titanium precursors, excess oleic acid and heptadecane. All reactions carried out in this study were variations of this general procedure; the detailed reaction conditions of the various experiments are listed in Table 1.

A typical TiO2 yield of this reaction was 74% and the organic content of the product was determined to be 26 wt% by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in air. Due to the capping with oleic acid, all products were dispersable in hexane and chloroform; completely clear dispersions could be obtained when small amounts of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide were added.6 The organic capping agents could be removed (as evidenced by TGA) by treatment with NaOH solution and subsequent washing with water, yielding hydrophilic products dispersible in water.
A number of techniques were used to characterise the products of the various reactions. TGA was carried out using a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 TGA. (2 ± 0.1) mg of TiO2 powder were heated in air (10 mL min−1) at 10 K min−1 between 50 and 850 °C. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained on a JEOL 2000FX, operating at 200 kV. Samples were dispersed in hexane, and deposited onto a holey carbon film. Mean diameters, lengths and aspect ratios were obtained from TEM image analysis of around 50 individual structures per sample. Raman spectra were collected in a range between 1000 and 2200 cm−1 on a LabRam Infinity Raman spectrometer, using a 532 nm laser. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on a Phillips PW1710 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with λ = 1.5406 Å. Crystal domain sizes, D, were calculated from the full width at half maximum, β, of the corresponding XRD peak at 2θ (after instrument broadening correction) using the Scherrer equation:  
Note that the values calculated for the [001] crystal domain sizes are best used for relative comparisons between samples due to the need for deconvolution of three overlapping peaks in the (004) region (for details refer to the ESI†). XRD analysis may, therefore, underestimate the nanorod length to some degree; however higher aspect ratios were clearly indicated under improved conditions (for an example see Fig. 6).
Results and discussion
Two-stage synthesis
In a first experiment, we investigated the products formed during the low-temperature stage of the reaction. TTIP and TiCl4 were reacted at 110 °C for four hours, omitting the high-temperature stage (Reaction 1); the products were washed with n-hexane to remove excess oleic acid and unreacted titanium precursors. TEM images of the product (Fig. 1A–C) show relatively monodisperse, equiaxed nanoparticles with average diameters of 2.5 ± 0.5 nm; no structures of rod-like morphology were observed. It is worth noting that high resolution TEM (HRTEM) could not resolve any crystal lattice, implying that the particles consist of amorphous TiO2. XRD (Fig. 1C) confirmed this observation, showing a broad, low intensity background peak between 2θ values of 15° and 35° typical for amorphous materials.
 Fig. 1  TEM images and XRD spectra of (A–C) amorphous TiO2 particles produced after reaction for 4 h at 110 °C (Reaction 1), and (D–F) TiO2 nanorods produced after reaction for 4 h at 110 °C, followed by 4 h at 300° without addition of extra TTIP at the beginning of the high-temperature stage (Reaction 2). 
In a second reaction (Reaction 2), an initial, low-temperature stage, equivalent to Reaction 1, was followed by a high-temperature stage at 300 °C for four hours in order to initiate crystallisation of the amorphous primary particles into anatase nanocrystals and to subsequently promote anisotropic nanorod crystal growth. The peaks in the XRD spectrum of the product confirm the presence of crystalline anatase (Fig. 1F). TEM revealed the presence of titania nanostructures with diameters of 3.9 ± 0.9 nm and lengths of 24 ± 14 nm. The edges of these nanostructures are relatively uneven and corrugated (Fig. 1E), and it is hard to discern individual structures due to the highly aggregated nature of the products. These observations suggest that complete crystallisation into anatase nanocrystals was achieved at the beginning of the high-temperature stage and that the formation of rod-like nanostructures observed occurred mainly via the aggregation and oriented attachment of these nanocrystals.
From the Scherrer analyses of the corresponding XRD peaks, the size of the (200) and (004) crystal domains (corresponding to nanorod diameter and length, respectively) were calculated to be 5 nm and 9 nm. The value obtained for the (200) crystal domain size is in good agreement with the nanorod diameter observed by TEM. The slightly larger average value deduced from the X-ray data (5 nm) compared to the diameter observed by TEM (3.9 nm) is likely to reflect inherent product heterogeneity as, for broad size distributions, diffraction methods (measuring volume averages) tend to be biased towards larger particle sizes. In contrast, the nanorod length indicated by the XRD analysis (9 nm) is markedly smaller than the length observed by TEM (24 nm) implying, incoherent grains within the individual nanorods probably due to incomplete attachment and fusion of the primary nanocrystals.
Due to the relatively low quality of the product from Reaction 2 in terms of aggregation and crystallographic anisotropy, a third reaction approach (Reaction 3) was investigated in which additional TTIP reactant feedstock (20 mmol) was added at the beginning of the high-temperature reaction stage in order to enable classical, anisotropic crystal growth of the primary particles. A relatively high, but controllable, injection rate of around 1 mL min−1 (i.e. 60 mL min−1) was chosen as it has been shown that fast precursor injection at high temperatures facilitates the reproducible formation of anatase TiO2 nanorods.35 TEM images of the products showed that relatively monodisperse anatase nanorods with diameters of 4.1 ± 0.4 nm and lengths of 41 ± 7 nm were formed (Fig. 2); thus, the nanorods have a larger aspect ratio than those produced without additional feedstock (Reaction 2). The nanorods were well spaced by about 1 nm, most likely due to oleic acid coating on each nanorod. The lattice planes observed by HRTEM (Fig. 2C) establish the single-crystalline nature of the products; the SAED pattern (Fig. 2C, inset) and XRD characterisation also indicated anatase TiO2.
 Fig. 2  TEM images and XRD spectrum of TiO2 nanorods produced after reaction for 4 h at 110 °C, 4 h at 300° with addition of extra TTIP (20 mmol) at the beginning of the high-temperature stage (Reaction 3). The (004) and {101} planes of anatase are marked and the SAED pattern is displayed in the inset. 
The sizes of the (200) and (004) crystal domains, as calculated from XRD peak broadening, were 4 nm and 21 nm, respectively, confirming significantly higher crystallographic anisotropy compared to the products of Reaction 2. For Reaction 3, the very good agreement between diameter values determined by XRD and TEM implies improved product homogeneity. Further, the dimension of the (004) crystal domains markedly increased compared to Reaction 2, indicating significantly better crystalline integrity of the individual nanostructures. It is also noteworthy that the edges of the nanorods were considerably smoother than observed for Reaction 2. These observations suggest that nanorod formation in Reaction 3 occurred via a combination of oriented attachment of the primary anatase nanocrystals, as observed for Reaction 2, and classical crystal growth from the additional TTIP feedstock. Due to the additional reactant feedstock in Reaction 3, primary particles preferentially extended along the [001] direction of anatase during the high-temperature phase, leading to longer nanorods than observed in Reaction 2. Further, the additional feedstock probably also enabled overgrowth of the initially rugged nanorod surface, resulting in smoother, more uniform nanorod structures and facilitating fusion of the anatase nanocrystals during oriented attachment. Note that a pure classical crystal growth mechanism can be excluded as the molar amount of titania precursors available after the additional feedstock injection would only suffice to grow nanorods of relatively small aspect ratios of around 3 from the pre-formed spherical particles. The proposed formation mechanism for the nanorod products obtained in our two-stage synthesis is summarised in Fig. 3. During the low temperature stage, the titanium precursors TTIP and TiCl4 initially form stable titanium oleate complexes (as indicated by a colour change of the reaction mixture upon heating from transparent to brown) which then slowly react to form amorphous, spherical TiO2 particles capped by oleic acid. Raising the temperature to 300 °C at the beginning of the second reaction stage results in the crystallisation of these amorphous particles to form primary anatase nanocrystals (probably with a bipyramidal crystal habit, typical for anatase macro- and nanocrystals). We have not succeeded in entirely isolating these pure primary nanocrystals from subsequent lengthening reactions, although very short segments were observed in the dilution experiments described below (Fig. 8B) Without the injection of extra Ti-monomer, these nanocrystals aggregate along their high-energy {001} facets (oriented attachment) to form rod-like, but corrugated morphologies, as observed for Reaction 2 (Fig. 1D–F). However, when extra TTIP is injected during the high-temperature stage, the primary nanocrystals can also grow via classic, preferential crystal growth along the {001} facets (promoted by the structure directing effect of oleic acid), while oriented attachment of the elongated nanocrystals is likely to occur simultaneously. Further, the presence of titanium oleate complexes in the second reaction stage enables overgrowth of the rugged rod surfaces, yielding relatively smooth nanostructures, as observed for Reaction 3 (Fig. 2).

Due to the high quality of the products, Reaction 3 formed the basis for the further reaction parameter studies described below.
Variation of the duration of the low-temperature stage
Four variations of the standard reaction were performed with the low-temperature stage lasting between zero and four hours, while the duration of the second phase was fixed at 4 h (Reactions 3–6). The TEM images of the products (Fig. 4) revealed clear changes in the product morphology: without the low-temperature phase (Reaction 4), the obtained TiO2 structures were highly polydispersed; a mixture of near-spherical particles, short rods and amorphous material was observed (Fig. 4A). With increasing time at low temperatures, the final products became more monodispersed and exhibited less amorphous TiO2 (Fig. 4B). After 4 h at low temperature, the nanorods obtained are very monodispersed, highly crystalline, and well-dispersed (Fig. 2A), as described above.
 Fig. 4  TEM images of products after reaction (A) without low-temperature stage (Reaction 4), and (B) with the low-temperature phase lasting 1 hour (Reaction 5). 
XRD characterisation (ESI, Fig. S2†) confirmed that the degree of crystallinity, and the aspect ratio, of the TiO2 nanorods are improved when the reaction included a long period (4 hours) at low temperature. These findings demonstrate that the introduction of a low-temperature reaction step enables a more controlled formation of primary particles. Without this step, nucleation takes place throughout the whole heating process, leading to pronounced product heterogeneity (Fig. 4A). However, with increasing time at low temperature (Fig. 4B and 2A), the TTIP and TiCl4, or associated oleate, react to form relatively uniform, amorphous TiO2 particles, that provide effective seeds for the subsequent crystal growth at higher temperatures. The disappearance of the amorphous content and secondary nucleation products suggests that 4 hours is sufficient to complete the initial conversion of TiCl4. The long timescale for seed growth reflects slow kinetics at low temperature, although their small size suggests that the particles are well-stabilised by bound oleic acid, as also evidenced by the particle separation in the TEM images. Further kinetic manipulation of the seed distribution by varying the nucleation or aging conditions may prove fruitful, in the future.
Variation of the duration and temperature of the high-temperature stage
Keeping the duration and temperature of the first stage constant (4 h at 110 °C), the duration (Reactions 7–9) and temperature (Reactions 10–12) of the second reaction stage were varied. TEM images for the variation of the reaction time at 300 °C are shown in Fig. 5. After an hour at 300 °C (Reaction 7), the nanorods synthesised were polydispersed in size and shape but highly crystalline, with no amorphous content (Fig. 5A). With longer times at high temperature (Reactions 8 and 3), more elongated rods with increased aspect ratios were formed and the uniformity of the product was significantly improved (Fig. 5B and 2A). However, when the reaction time was further increased to 18 h (Reaction 9), a mixture of straight and branched nanorods were observed. A typical branched structure had four arms, each ∼3.5 nm in diameter and ∼12 nm in length, consisting of highly crystalline anatase, as indicated by the (004) and {101} planes resolved in TEM (Fig. 5C). Each branch extended in the direction of the c-axis of anatase. This morphological evolution of the TiO2 crystals is in agreement with the proposed mechanism of nanorod formation. Initially, nanorod growth occurs via a combination of classical, preferential crystal growth and oriented attachment of the primary particles, resulting in rod-like nanostructures with increasingly larger aspect ratios. At longer reaction times, the supply of TTIP is exhausted, so that classical crystal growth stops, and further nanorod growth occurs through oriented attachment only. In this regime, the nanorods have already reached a relatively high aspect ratio while the concentration of primary particles steadily decreases. Under such conditions, the probability of end-to-end attachments decreases significantly while attachments to the nanorod sides become more likely, resulting in the formation of the branched and aggregated structures at very long reaction times.

Further, reactions with high-temperatures stages at 200–275 °C (Reactions 10–12) were carried out. The temperature of the second reaction stage was found to influence the crystallinity and aspect ratio of the nanorods. After reaction at 200 °C (Reaction 10), no rods were observed by TEM, although selected area electron diffraction (SAED) indicated the presence of some crystalline material (ESI, Fig. S3†). For reactions between 250 and 275 °C (Reactions 11 and 12), TEM showed low aspect ratio nanorods with significant fractions of amorphous material (ESI, Fig. S3†) while the nanorods produced at 300 °C (Reaction 3) appeared highly crystalline (Fig. 2A). XRD characterisation (Fig. 6) confirmed reduced fractions of amorphous material with increasing temperature. These findings confirm that, although crystallisation begins at temperatures as low as 225 °C, the high-temperature phase should be at least 300 °C to ensure full crystallinity in a reasonable timeframe.
 Fig. 6  XRD spectra of TiO2 products after reactions with the high-temperature stage lasting 200 °C, 250 °C, 275 °C and 300 °C (Reactions 10, 11, 12 and 3). 
The crystal domain sizes, as calculated from the corresponding XRD peak widths (Fig. 6), indicate that higher temperatures in the second reaction stage led to larger crystallite sizes in the [001] direction, i.e. along the nanorod axis, while the crystallite size of the (200) domains remained roughly constant. For the lower temperatures, XRD indicated only relatively small anisotropy (consistent with the TEM observations), implying that the primary nanocrystals mainly grew by atom addition from the extra titanium feedstock, with relatively little oriented assembly. In contrast, the crystallographic anisotropy is considerably increased to about 5 for the reaction at 300 °C, indicating significantly improved crystalline integrity along the nanorod axis, potentially due to the promotion of complete nanocrystal fusion at higher temperatures.
Variation of the molar ratio of titanium precursors to structure directing agent
In a second set of experiments the influence of the molar ratio of titanium precursors and oleic acid was systematically studied.
The ratio of TTIP:TiCl4:OLEA was varied between 1:1:1 and 1:1:12 by keeping the amounts of TTIP (10 mmol) and TiCl4 (10 mmol) constant, whilst changing the amount of oleic acid between 10 mmol and 120 mmol (Reactions 15–20).
At low concentrations of the structure-directing agent (10 and 20 mmol OLEA), polydispersed nanoparticles with aspect ratios of between 1 and ∼3 were formed (Fig. 7A and B). On increasing the amount of oleic acid to 30 and 40 mmol, nanorods of improved monodispersity and aspect ratio (Fig. 7C and D) were obtained. However, when further increasing the oleic acid content (Fig. 7E and F), the aspect ratio of the nanorods was reduced. This observed trend is in agreement with reports in the literature24,36 and can be explained considering the crystal growth mechanisms discussed above.
 Fig. 7  TEM images of TiO2 nanostructures obtained in the presence of 10 mmol of TiCl4, 10 mmol of TTIP and (A) 10 mmol, (B) 20 mmol, (C) 30 mmol, (D) 40 mmol, (E) 60 mmol, and (F) 120 mmol oleic acid (Reactions 15–20). The table displays the particle sizes, calculated from statistical analysis of the TEM images. 
The relative stability of the structure directing agent (oleic acid) in the non-coordinating solvent (heptadecane) is likely to also play an important role, due to the reversible dynamic equilibrium between free oleic acid in solution and oleic acid molecules bound at the nanoparticle surfaces.21 In the presence of relatively small amounts of SDA, most of the oleic acid is in solution so that the facets of the initial small anatase nanocrystals are not modified sufficiently to promote anisotropy. In the intermediate regime, the equilibrium is shifted towards coordinated oleic acid, and, hence, sufficient SDA molecules are available to bind (selectively) to the TiO2 surface in order to induce the growth of one-dimensional rods with higher aspect ratios. However, when relatively large amounts of oleic acid are used the equilibrium shifts towards surface coordination, likely binding all available crystal facets, thereby, inhibiting both atomic additions and oriented attachment, leading to reduced aspect ratios.
Variation of the dilution of reaction
Increasing the dilution of the reaction (Reactions 3, 13 and 14) had an adverse effect on the overall quality of the nanorods (Fig. 8). On increasing the heptadecane volume from 7.5 mL (Reaction 3, Fig. 2A) to 22.5 mL (Reaction 13, Fig. 8A), TEM indicated that the average aspect ratio of the rods decreased from 10 to around 7, and some nanorods were branched or rugged. At even higher dilution of 75 mL heptadecane (Reaction 14, Fig. 8B), the average aspect ratio reduced further to around 2.5.

The decrease of aspect ratio with increasing content of solvent is consistent with a shift in the equilibrium of bound oleic acid (SDA) to that in solution, in turn reducing the anisotropy of the system.21 In our system, an additional effect is that oriented attachment of the anatase nanocrystals is less favourable under high dilution conditions due to the lower probability of particle encounters. As the diffusion of the primary nanocrystals is likely to be significantly slower than the diffusion of the smaller, molecular titania precursors, classical crystal growth and Ostwald ripening are likely to be predominant in diluted systems, consistent with the formation of heterogeneous, small aspect ratio nanostructures.
Conclusions
Crystalline, high aspect ratio TiO2 anatase nanorods with diameters of around 4 nm and lengths of up to 40 nm were produced via a one-pot, non-hydrolytic reaction carried out in two distinct temperature stages. Through this approach, the nucleation of spherical amorphous TiO2 nanoparticles at low temperatures was successfully separated from nanorod growth at higher temperatures. Under the standard conditions used in this paper, nanorod growth occurred both via preferential, atom-by-atom growth from titanium precursor feedstock and through oriented attachment of the seeds formed during the low-temperature stage of the reaction. Product quality and dimensions of the nanostructures can be controlled through the independent variation of the parameters of the two reaction stages. The uniformity and crystallinity of the nanorods was considerably improved by optimizing the initial nucleation stage, while anisotropic crystal growth was influenced through the reaction parameters of the high-temperature stage. The promotion of complete fusion during oriented attachment through additional titanium precursor feedstock and higher temperatures in the second reaction stage was crucial to obtain larger crystallographic aspect ratios. More generally, the nanorod aspect ratio was found to depend on dilution and the stoichiometry of reactants and structure directing agent. Further control over the nanorod dimensions and aspect ratio might be achieved by changing the reaction conditions of the nucleation stage (e.g. temperature or reactant ratio) or by using different structure directing agents, such as amines. The concept of improving the control of product morphology and quality through the separation of particle nucleation and growth ought to be transferable to the non-hydrolytic synthesis of other technologically important metal oxide nanostructures, including SnO2 and ZnO nanorods. Our approach could also be utilised to synthesise hybrid nanorods with distinct internal substructures from organic precursors of two different metals in a single reaction. Such hybrid systems may complement the optoelectronic and (photo)catalytic applications envisioned for pure titania nanorods. The continued optimisation of the synthetic routes by detailed mechanistic and kinetic studies, will enhance a wide range of applications through improved crystallinity, monodispersity, and dimensional control.
