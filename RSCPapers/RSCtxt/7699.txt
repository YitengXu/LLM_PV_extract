, Accepted 21st September 2016First published on 21st September 2016AbstractHydrogenated hematite has been prepared and the effect of oxygen vacancies has been investigated. An obvious cathodic shift (up to 120 mV) of the onset potential can be observed after hydrogenation treatment, revealing the interesting role of oxygen vacancies in hematite to lower the onset potential in contrast to that leading to high onset potential in the literature. The results suggest that the high onset potential should be attributed to the low temperature treatment. The optimized hematite with oxygen vacancies exhibits a high photocurrent of 2.12 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a relatively low onset potential around 0.8 V vs. RHE. It can be further coupled with a Co–Pi catalyst, P-doping or FeNiOx catalyst to achieve a high photocurrent of 2.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a low onset potential of 0.62 V vs. RHE. Significantly, the hematite modified with both P-doping and a FeNiOx catalyst can show a synergetic effect to yield a photocurrent of 2.00 mA cm−2 at a low bias of 1.0 V vs. RHE, which is among the best values reported. The benefits of facile, low-cost preparation, and high performance promise the hydrogenated hematite to be an excellent precursor material for further modifications for solar water splitting applications.
Introduction
Hematite is widely recognized as a promising photocatalyst for solar water oxidation due to its favorable band gap (2.1–2.2 eV), good stability in oxidative solution, low cost and wide abundance.1–6 However, the performance of hematite remains insufficient and many problems, such as low conductivity, poor reaction kinetics or short hole diffusion length, hinder practical applications.7–10 Various approaches such as morphology control, elemental doping and surface catalysts have been developed to improve the performance of hematite in recent years but with limited success.10–26 An important approach among them is to develop a good precursor which can be further modified or designed, such as via elemental doping or surface catalysts, to achieve better performance.
The slight adjustment of Fe and O ratio in hematite, named “intrinsic doping” with oxygen vacancies, has been considered to be a good way for preparing good precursor materials, since it improves the performance without introducing any foreign elements and can thus be further coupled with elemental doping or surface treatments for better performance.18,24,25,27–29 Indeed, intrinsic doping of oxygen vacancies via sintering of FeOOH in oxygen-deficient atmosphere enabled the hematite photoanode to achieve a high photocurrent of 1.82 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE.18 However, the hematite photoanodes thus prepared typically suffered from a high onset potential (over 0.9 V vs. RHE).18,24,27 The mechanism was then carefully studied.24,25,27–29 Recently, by using transient absorption spectroscopy the high onset potential was assigned to the increased surface defect states with the introduction of oxygen vacancies.24 It also showed that surface passivation treatments such as coating passivation layers could significantly lower the high onset potential.24 However, it is still hard to explain the relatively low onset potential of hematite by the post treatments in a reductive atmosphere (annealing in the presence of NaBH4 or NH3BH3 (AB)).28,29 There are two steps to prepare this kind of hematite: (i) sintering FeOOH in air at 550 °C for 2 h and then 750 °C for 10 min to produce the pristine hematite; (ii) annealing the pristine hematite at around 500 °C in a reductive atmosphere to produce oxygen vacancies.28,29 Considering the low onset potential, the pristine hematite sintered at 750 °C may have already removed the defect sites,16 and the further process to produce suitable oxygen vacancies itself may not lead to defect states and high onset potential. Since the way to produce oxygen vacancies by sintering of FeOOH in oxygen-deficient atmosphere typically has only one step treatment at a low temperature (lower than 550 °C),18,24,27 the effect of oxygen vacancies and low temperature annealing could be confused to explain the origin of the high onset potential.
Here we design a one step experiment to produce oxygen vacancies by directly sintering FeOOH in the presence of NH3BH3 (AB) at a temperature around 800 °C, which may clearly address the relationship between oxygen vacancies and the high onset potential. Interestingly, the treatment in a reductive atmosphere at high temperature can keep a low onset potential without introducing any further defect states compared to the pristine hematite. Moreover, it can significantly lower the onset potential with a large value of 120 mV, similar to the effect of those efficient cocatalysts.4,5 The results strongly suggest that suitable oxygen vacancies in hematite can actually lower the onset potential in contrast to the role responsible for high onset potential in the literatures.18,24,25,27–29 The defect states leading to the high onset potential should be attributed to the low temperature annealing. The optimized sample exhibits a high photocurrent of 2.12 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a low onset potential around 0.8 V vs. RHE, which is a cathodic shift of 40 mV compared to the sample prepared by the post treatment method.29 Benefited from the low onset potential and the high photocurrent, the present hydrogenated hematite can serve as a good starting material for further modifications such as Co–Pi catalyst, P-doping and/or FeNiOx catalyst, which have achieved a high photocurrent of 2.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a low onset potential of 0.62 V vs. RHE. Notably, the present anode is capable of yielding a high photocurrent of 2.00 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. RHE, which is comparable to the best value at this bias.4,5,14,15,17,20,21 The initial high performance and the compatibility for further modifications should make the present hydrogenated hematite an excellent precursor material for water splitting catalysts.
Experimental section
Preparation of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes
A modified hydrothermal method was used to prepare the pristine hematite photoanodes grown on a fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan, 14 ohm per sq.) glass substrate.11,29 Briefly, A teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave was filled with 80 mL aqueous solution containing 0.05 M ferric chloride (FeCl3·6H2O, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) and 0.05 M sodium nitrate (NaNO3, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd). Then the autoclave with cleaned FTO glass slide (30 mm × 50 mm × 2 mm) was heated at 95 °C for 4 h to produce FeOOH on FTO.11,29 The FeOOH-coated substrate was washed with deionized water and subsequently sintered in air at 800 °C for 8 min.12,26 The product was labeled as the pristine hematite.
To prepare AB-treated hematite, the pyrolysis of NH3BH3 (AB, Sigma-aldrich Co.) solution was used in the sintering process (the experimental setup can be found in the ESI S1†). AB solutions with various concentrations (12.5 mM, 20 mM, 25 mM, 35 mM and 50 mM) in a small crucible were heated along with the sintering of FeOOH (800 °C for a few min). The system was supported on a quartz glass and a big crucible covered the whole system. The final product was labeled as the AB-treated hematite (one step). The AB-treated hematite by post treatment was also prepared by the same method described in our previous report.29
Cobalt phosphate (Co–Pi) catalyst was deposited on the AB-treated hematite by photo-assisted electrodeposition in a three-electrode system.4 P-doping was performed by soaking the AB-treated hematite in phosphoric acid (0.1 M) for 10 min followed by annealing at 300 °C for 2 h.15 The deposition of FeNiOx catalyst was performed by a similar process described in the ref. 14.
Structural characterization
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM, FEI Quanta 200F), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TIWN), X-ray photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS, Kratos AXIS UltraDLD) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical, Zmpyrean) were used for the morphology and structural characterization.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements
The working area of hematite photoanodes was about 0.1 cm2 with the left part covered by non-conductive hysol epoxy.27 An electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D) was used for the PEC measurements. The pH value of the electrolyte (1 M NaOH) was controlled at 13.6. The measured voltage was converted into the potential vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The light source was a Xenon High Brightness Cold Light Sources (XD-300) equipped with AM 1.5 filter and the light power density was 100 mW cm−2. A xenon lamp (CEL-HXF300/CEL-HXBF300, 300W) coupled with a monochromator (Omni-λ3005) was used to measure the IPCE data. The bias voltage for the Mott–Schottky plots was scanned from −0.4 to 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the dark at a frequency of 1 kHz.
Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows the SEM and TEM images of the pristine and AB-treated hematite nanostructures with an AB concentration of 25 mM. The hydrothermal process was first used to form FeOOH on FTO substrate and then a high-temperature sintering process (800 °C for a few min) in air to form hematite.12,26 Our experimental setup for AB-treatment is shown in the ESI S1.† The AB solution container was put along with FeOOH during annealing to form hydrogenated hematite. The morphology of the pristine sample in Fig. 1a is a thin film of nanorods on the FTO substrate, similar to those in the literatures.11,13,26–28 Fig. 1b shows that the sample from AB-treatment has a similar morphology to the pristine sample. Fig. 1c and d shows the TEM images of the AB-treated hematite nanostructures. The high-resolution TEM image in Fig. 1d shows clearly the hematite crystal structure. In the ESI S2† the XRD data clearly confirm the hematite structure (JCPDS 33-0664).

Fig. 2a compares the photocurrent density versus applied potential (J–V) scans of the present hematite photoanodes before (pristine) and after AB-treatment (one step, 8 min). The AB-treated hematite prepared by a post treatment method described in our previous report is also shown for comparison.29 Fig. 2b shows the J–V scans of the AB-treated (one step) hematite photoanodes treated with different times. In Fig. 2a the pristine sample shows a photocurrent of 1.11 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is comparable to the literatures.27,28 However, the AB-treated hematite shows a significant enhancement in photocurrent of 2.12 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, and also keeps a low onset potential around 0.8 V vs. RHE. The high photocurrent can be assigned to the introduction of oxygen vacancies by AB-treatment. It is well known that intrinsic doping of oxygen vacancies can be introduced in hematite via sintering of FeOOH in oxygen-deficient atmosphere or by a post treatment in a reductive atmosphere.18,24,27–29 The oxygen vacancies can improve the photocurrent density by enhance the conductivity or block the slow surface hole–bulk electron recombination pathways.18,24 In our experiments the pyrolysis of AB will release H2 to form a reduced atmosphere and oxygen vacancies can thus be produced to enhance the photocurrent. The only difference between the pristine and AB-treated hematite samples is the addition of AB in the sintering process. Considering the experimental setup for this experiment (AB and FeOOH were separately displayed), only the released H2 may have significant effect to the final product (XPS results below also show no N and B signal). Thus we attribute the AB-treated effect to the introduction of oxygen vacancies by the reductive atmosphere. Actually, when a high concentration of AB was used, the final product can be black color indicating the existence of magnetite with large amounts of oxygen vacancies though the performance of the sample is very low.

Interesting information can be obtained from Fig. 2b when tuning the annealing times. At the initial stage to produce oxygen vacancies (blue curve, 2 min), a significant onset potential shift can be observed compared to the pristine sample, which shows a large value of 120 mV (from 0.81 to 0.69 V vs. RHE). The obvious lowering of the onset potential indicates that suitable oxygen vacancies will not lead to defect sites, but may remove some defects to lower the onset potential. The observation is actually consistent with previously reported samples annealed in oxygen-deficient atmosphere at low temperature.18,24,27 Although they suffered from the high onset potential (over 0.9 V vs. RHE), the onset potential was actually significantly improved when compared to the pristine sample annealed at the same temperature, which showed a very low performance.18,24,27 Suitable oxygen vacancies in hematite can improve both the photocurrent and the onset potential, which is previously confused by the low temperature annealing effect. Here our one step experiments at 800 °C screen the effect of annealing temperature and the effect of oxygen vacancies can thus be clearly shown. When increasing the annealing time (red curve, 8 min), the onset potential shifts to higher voltage but the photocurrent increases a lot. More oxygen vacancies will lead to higher conductivity to enhance the photocurrent, while the photo-inactive magnetite can also be produced to increase the onset potential. It is a balance between the photocurrent and the onset potential and suitable oxygen vacancies in hematite are important for the optimized performance. It should be noted that even for the red curve, the onset potential is still lower than that of the pristine sample, indicating the effective role of oxygen vacancies to lower the onset potential. Further treatments with longer annealing time will result in both lower photocurrent and higher onset potential, due to the formation of magnetite. Considering the suitable photocurrent and onset potential, we select the sample treated for 8 min as the optimized sample for further modifications. The AB-treated hematite prepared by the post treatment method (annealed at around 500 °C) is also shown for comparison (Fig. 2a).29 An obvious cathodic shift of the onset potential (about 40 mV) in the sample treated by one step at 800 °C can be observed when compared to the sample by the post treatment, indicating the effective surface passivation by high temperature annealing.
The following comparison to literature reports highlights the excellent performance of the present AB-treated hematite photoanodes by this one step method. Pristine hematite photoanodes without extrinsic elemental doping or post treatments have been reported and shown to have various degrees of performance improvement. For example, a cauliflower-type hematite with controlled morphology was prepared by atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) showing excellent performance.5 Recently, a re-growth strategy was developed to reduce surface disorders of the pristine hematite for high performance.3 For the hematite nanostructures prepared by the hydrothermal method, experimental conditions were investigated and controlled to get better performance.23 A hematite nanostructure without extrinsic elemental doping or post treatments was recently reported to show a high photocurrent of 1.58 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE.26 In comparison, our AB-treated hematite with a photocurrent of 2.12 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE is the best performing photoandoe amongst all the reported hematite samples without extrinsic elemental doping or post treatments.3,5,18,23–26 The AB-treated hematite with a high photocurrent of 2.12 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a relatively low onset potential is expected to be a superior precursor to design high-performance catalysts.
Fig. 2c shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of the pristine and AB-treated (one step method, 8 min) hematite photoanodes (at 1.23 V vs. RHE). Significant improvement in the IPCE is observed for the AB-treated sample, confirming the higher J–V values. A maximum IPCE of 53% is observed for the AB-treated sample by one step at 370 nm, versus 22% for the pristine sample and 40% for the sample by post treatment. The photochemical stability curves of the pristine and AB-treated hematite photoanodes collected at 1.23 V vs. RHE reveal the long-time stability, as shown in the ESI S3.† The experimental conditions such as the annealing temperature and AB concentration (ESI S4†) in the sintering process have been optimized to achieve the best performance.
The introduction of oxygen vacancies in the AB-treated hematite will typically increase the donor density.18,27–29 Fig. 3 shows the Mott–Schottky plots of the pristine and AB-treated (one step) hematite photoanodes,27,30 from which carrier densities can be estimated by using an equation:Nd = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1
 Fig. 3  Mott–Schottky plots of the pristine and AB-treated (by one step and post treatment) hematite samples. 
In the equation e0 is the electron charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), ε is the dielectric constant of α-Fe2O3 (80),30 ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum (8.854 × 10−14 F m−1), while Nd is the donor density and V is the potential applied at the electrode. Capacitances can be derived from the electrochemical impedance obtained at each potential. We thus obtained the carrier densities of 5.68 × 1018 cm−3, 1.01 × 1020 cm−3, and 2.20 × 1019 cm−3 for the pristine hematite, AB-treated hematite (one step) and AB-treated hematite (post treatment), respectively. The AB-treated hematite (one step) sample shows significantly higher donor density (hematite is n-type semiconductor with a positive M–S slope), more than 10 times higher than the pristine sample. The enhanced carrier density strongly support the existence of oxygen vacancies in the AB-treated hematite to improve the conductivity and contribute to the enhanced performance.18,27–29
The electronic structure of the AB-treated (one step) hematite has been characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS survey spectra in Fig. 4a show strong Fe and O signals for both the pristine and AB-treated hematite photoanodes, consistent with the hematite structure. The C signal comes from the adsorbed carbon contaminations, while the Sn signal is from the Sn diffusion from FTO substrate.11 The Fe 2p XPS spectra of the pristine and AB-treated (one step, 8 min) hematite samples are shown in Fig. 4b, which reveal the existence of Fe2+ in the AB-treated sample confirming the oxygen vacancies.18 The O 1s spectrum of the AB-treated sample also shows an enhanced peak around 532 eV, indicating the oxygen vacancies.31,32 No B or N signals can be observed in the AB-treated samples, confirming the H2 effect to produce oxygen vacancies. By using high concentration of AB and long time annealing, slightly black sample due to the formation of magnetite can be observed supporting the reduction process in our experiments.

To investigate the capability of the present AB-treated hematite as a good precursor to achieve higher performance, we applied post treatments such as Co–Pi catalyst, P-doping and/or FeNiOx catalyst to the AB-treated sample. Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves of the AB-treated and Co–Pi/AB-treated hematite photoanodes. The AB-treated sample decorated with Co–Pi catalyst achieves better performance, yielding a higher photocurrent of 2.61 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a lower onset potential of 0.62 V vs. RHE. These performance values are close to the best, i.e. 2.7–3.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, previously reported for hematite photoanodes.4,5,19,20 However, the facile AB treatment to enhance performance in hematite should offer significant advantages over those complex methods for preparing hematite, such as APCVD, colloidal nanocrystal deposition, or 3D hexagonal nanocore preparation.

Other treatments have also been applied to the AB-treated hematite to demonstrate it to be a good generic precursor, as shown by the J–V curves in Fig. 5b. P-doping and optically transparent FeNiOx catalyst treatments have been effective in improving the photocurrent and lowering the onset potential of hematite, respectively.14,15 To take advantage of both treatments, we first coated P element on the AB-treated hematite anode to improve the photocurrent, then followed by deposition of FeNiOx catalyst to lower the onset potential. Elemental mapping (the ESI S5†) and XAS spectra at the P K-edge (the ESI S6†) clearly show P in the P-doped/AB-treated sample. Compared to the non-doped sample, the P-doped/AB-treated hematite shows a significant improvement in photocurrent, yielding 2.44 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and 1.51 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. RHE. Deposition of FeNiOx catalyst further improved the performance of P-doped/AB-treated hematite. The FeNiOx/P-doped/AB-treated hematite shows a high photocurrent of 2.67 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a low onset potential of about 0.61 V vs. RHE. Remarkably, the photocurrent at 1.0 V vs. RHE reaches an impressive value of 2.0 mA cm−2.
The hematite anode giving a high photocurrent at a low onset potential (1.0 V or below) can be coupled in tandem with a solar cell to perform efficient unassisted water splitting. Indeed, a tandem device combining a hematite photoanode was reported to have an admirable solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 2.0% for unassisted water splitting.14 Note that the STH efficiency of such a tandem device was limited by the FeNiOx/Al2O3-coated hematite photoanode, which only had a photocurrent of 1.5 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. RHE. Therefore, the use of a hematite anode with a higher photocurrent in a tandem device could elevate the STH efficiency towards the practical level. In this regard, our FeNiOx/P-doped/AB-treated hematite capable of a high photocurrent of 2.0 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. RHE should be particularly attractive as a promising photoanode. In fact, the present photocurrent value at 1.0 V bias is already among the best values reported in the literatures, as shown in Table S1.†4,5,15,17,20,21,33–41 The two hematite photoanodes giving photocurrents higher than 2.0 mA cm−2 (Table S1†) required the decoration of expensive noble metals (Au or Pt) for enhanced performance, whereas the present hematite samples consist only of widely abundant and low-cost elements. The facile preparation at low cost should offer the present P-doped and FeNiOx-coated AB-treated hematite photoanodes a great potential for large-scale applications.
The high performance of the present photoanodes can be largely attributed to the precursor AB-treated hematite having a high photocurrent and a low onset potential. Fig. 5c illustrates the effects of FeNiOx, P-doping, and AB-treatment in the hematite photoanode, revealing that oxygen vacancies (V0) reside in the near-surface region,29 P-doping underneath the top-surface region, and FeNiOx catalyst on the top surface, i.e. they locate in different regions in the final hematite sample to collectively enhance high performance. The J–V scan of the FeNiOx/AB-treated hematite photoanode (ESI S7†) is also shown exhibiting a smaller onset potential compared to the AB-treated sample. The photocurrents of the P-doped/AB-treated and FeNiOx/P-doped/AB-treated hematite photoanodes (ESI S8†) at 1.0 V vs. RHE are also shown which remain very stable over a long time. The final product test is shown in the ESI S9† confirming the existence of H2 and O2. The results collectively show that the AB-treated hematite is a superior precursor material to design high-performance photocatalysts.
Conclusions
AB-treated hematite has been prepared as an excellent precursor for high-performance solar water splitting catalysts due to its low cost, high photocurrent, and low onset potential. The results reveal that oxygen vacancies in the hydrogenated hematite can significantly lower the onset potential with a large value of 120 mV. The high onset potential widely reported in the literatures can be actually attributed to the low temperature treatment itself. The hydrogenated hematite exhibits a high photocurrent of 2.12 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a relatively low onset potential around 0.8 V vs. RHE. Various modifications have been applied to the AB-treated hematite to achieve even higher performance. Coating of Co–Pi catalyst on the AB-treated hematite yields a high photocurrent of 2.61 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V and a low onset potential of 0.62 V vs. RHE. Application of P-doping and FeNiOx catalyst to the AB-treated hematite can also enhance photocurrent and reduce onset potential. Particularly, the P-doped/AB-treated hematite photoanode treated with FeNiOx shows a high photocurrent of 2.0 mA cm−2 at a low bias of 1.0 V vs. RHE, which is comparable to the best values reported and adeptly suitable for unassisted water splitting application. Its facile preparation and high photocurrent capacity at low bias voltage promises the AB-treated, hydrogenated hematite to be a superior starting material for further modifications.
