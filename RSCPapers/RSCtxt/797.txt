    , Accepted 2nd June 2014First published on 2nd June 2014AbstractSub-nanosecond charge dynamics in monodisperse Au nanoparticles (NPs) supported on TiO2 colloidal spheres are studied as a function of NP diameter using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. The decay of the transmittance changes observed in the region of the plasmon resonance of the Au NPs following photoexcitation of the TiO2 spheres are well-described by a bi-exponential function consisting of a fast component of 2 ps duration associated with electron–phonon scattering, followed by a slow and relatively weak component associated with phonon–phonon scattering. The decay constant characterising the latter component was found to be dependent on the size of the Au NPs, rising from 49 ± 3 to 128 ± 6 ps as the diameter of the Au NPs increased from 12.2 ± 2.2 nm to 24.5 ± 2.8 nm, respectively.
1. Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely investigated as a photocatalyst for water splitting and for the photo-degradation of organic pollutants, and in the development of dye sensitized solar cells.1–4 However, its performance in these applications is limited by a high recombination rate for photo-generated electron–hole pairs and a relatively large band gap5 [3.23 eV (385 nm) for bulk anatase TiO2].6–9
Nonetheless, the photocatalytic and photovoltaic efficiency of TiO2 can be significantly improved by depositing noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) over its surface. These NPs can act as electron traps, aiding electron–hole separation and thus improving the quantum yield.10–12 Further, metals that support localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the visible part of the spectrum (such as Ag and Au) can augment the formation of charge carriers due to plasmonic effects.13 However, the synthesis of metal NPs on TiO2 that are monodisperse in size and have a uniform distribution over the surface remains challenging. The ability to produce samples with such well-controlled features enables the systematic investigation of the TiO2–NPs system and, ultimately, its optimization for photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications.
Recently, we developed a facile strategy for the synthesis of TiO2–Au hybrid materials comprised of TiO2 colloidal spheres decorated with Au NPs displaying monodisperse sizes and uniform dispersion over the TiO2 surface (Fig. 1).14 Our approach was based on the utilization of TiO2 colloidal spheres as templates for successive Au deposition steps employing AuCl4(aq)− as the Au precursor, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the stabilizer, ascorbic acid as the reducing agent, and water as the solvent (Fig. 1A). The size of the Au NPs could be controlled in the 12 to 25 nm region by this methodology (Fig. 1B–D), enabling the investigation of the properties of the TiO2–Au system as a function of size.

The scale bars in the insets correspond to 100 nm. 
In recent years, the optical characteristics of TiO2 when combined with Au NPs have been widely reported.1,9–12,14–16 However, most of the ultrafast studies published17–19 on TiO2–Au NPs have investigated the electron injection process from the Au to the conduction band of the TiO2. Electron capture from the TiO2 conduction band to the Au NPs has not yet been studied on a sub-nanosecond time-scale. This process is key to improving the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2.11 Here we report the study of picosecond-scale electron dynamics in monodisperse Au NPs following photoexcitation of the TiO2 colloidal spheres to which they are adsorbed. We use ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy for this investigation and determine the effect of Au NPs diameter on the rate of electron relaxation after capture from the TiO2.
2. Experimental
2.1. Sample preparation
Analytical grade chemicals HAuCl4·3H2O, (hydrogen tetrachloroaurate trihydrate, 48% in gold, Synth), PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone, Sigma-Aldrich, M.W. 55.000 g mol−1), EG (ethylene glycol, 99.5%, Vetec), C3H6O (acetone, 99.5%, Vetec), C2H4O2 (acetic acid, 99.7%, Synth), C6H8O6 (ascorbic acid, 99.0%, BioXtra), and Ti(OBu)4 (titanium butoxide, 97%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as received. All solutions were prepared using deionized water (18.2 MΩ).
The synthesis of TiO2 colloidal spheres decorated with Au NPs (TiO2–Au samples) was performed according to the recently described protocol which started with the synthesis of TiO2 colloidal spheres20 followed by their utilization as templates for Au NPs deposition.14 Typically, an aqueous suspension containing TiO2 colloidal spheres (1 mL, ∼0.9 mg) was added to an aqueous solution (6 mL) containing 35 mg of PVP and 60 mg of ascorbic acid, followed by heating to 90 °C under stirring. After 10 min, the first deposition step was performed by adding 3 mL of a 1 mM AuCl4(aq)− solution and allowing the reaction to proceed for 3 h. A second and third deposition steps were performed by adding another 3 mL of a 1 mM AuCl4(aq)− solution to the reaction mixture obtained at the end of the first and second deposition steps, respectively, followed by stirring at 90 °C for another 3 h. The solids obtained after the first, second and third reduction steps were denoted as TiO2–Au1, TiO2–Au2, and TiO2–Au3, respectively (Fig. 1). In all cases, the products were harvested by centrifugation, washed several times with water, and re-suspended in water for further use.
2.2. Experimental techniques
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 1B–D) were obtained with a JEOL microscope FEG-SEM JSM 6330F operated at 5 kV. The samples for SEM were prepared by drop-casting an aqueous suspension of the nanostructures over a Si wafer, followed by drying under ambient conditions.
For optical characterisation, the samples were placed in 10 mm thick quartz cuvettes and diluted with deionized water so that the absorbance (natural logarithm) was 0.2 to 0.5. The steady state absorption and the photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured with the use of a Perkin Elmer Lambda 1050 UV/Vis/NIR spectrometer and a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog model iHR(FL3-22) spectrofluorometer, respectively.
The sub-nanosecond electron dynamics were studied using a home-built ultrafast transient absorption spectrometer. This is a pump–probe technique in which changes in the sample absorbance induced by the pump beam are determined by monitoring the transmission of the probe beam through the sample. Varying the arrival time of the probe pulse relative to the pump pulse allows a transmittance change transient to be measured. In our experiment, a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator–amplifier laser system (Spectra Physics, SpitfirePro) was used to produce 100 fs, 1 mJ pulses at a repetition rate of 1 kHz. A beam splitter directs 95% of the amplifier output to an optical parametric amplifier (Light Conversion, TOPAS) with subsequent harmonic generation which produces a pump beam tunable in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum. The remaining part of the laser system output was directed through a 2 mm thick sapphire crystal in order to create a white light continuum which acts as the probe beam; this was then split into sample and reference arms. The former was focussed to a 1 mm spot size at the sample position whereas the latter bypassed the sample. Both of these beams were directed into a monochromator (SpectroPro 2500i) and detected by two silicon photodiodes. An optical chopper was used to modulate the pump beam at 500 Hz, which enabled phase-sensitive detection of pump-induced changes in the sample beam power. The spot size of the pump beam at the sample was 4 mm; hence an average power of the chopped pump beam of 1 mW was equivalent to a fluence of 16 μJ cm−2. A 200 mm-long, computer-controlled delay stage (Newport ILS) allowed the difference in arrival time of the pump and probe pulses to be varied. The samples under investigation were all stirred by a magnetic stirrer (Thermo Scientific, Variomag Mini) at 1000 rpm throughout the experiments. A more detailed description of our experimental technique can be found elsewhere.21–25
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Spectroscopic characterization

Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the steady state absorption and PL spectra for all the samples, respectively. To emphasise the relative contribution of the Au NPs, in Fig. 2(a) each of the spectra have been normalized to zero at 700 nm and to 1 at 370 nm, wavelengths at which the absorbance of the TiO2 is known to dominate.26 For the samples with Au NPs, the plasmonic absorption peak is evident, centred at ∼530 nm, on an otherwise monotonous rise with decreasing wavelength; no such feature can be seen for the pure TiO2 sample. The PL peak (see Fig. 2(b)) is broad and the centre of it shifts from about 387 to 395 nm on the addition of the Au NPs. The spectral position of the PL corresponds to band edge recombination in TiO2, and its red-shift on the addition of the Au is consistent with the equilibration of the Fermi levels under ultraviolet illumination reported previously.11 The PL intensity was significantly weaker for TiO2–Au1 and TiO2–Au2 than for the TiO2 sample, evident in the normalised spectra shown as increased signal fluctuation, and this weakening is attributed to electron injection into the Au NPs reducing recombination at the band edge of TiO2. The more intense PL for TiO2–Au3, resulting in a less noisy normalised spectrum, is consistent with the reduced Fermi level shift for larger NP diameters reported previously11 making electron injection less energetically favourable at equilibrium.

Fig. 3 shows the pump-induced transmittance change spectra, ΔT/T|t=0, for the TiO2 and TiO2–Au samples for excitation at a wavelength of 370 nm and at the time, t0, immediately after pumping when the change is a maximum. Also shown for comparison is the spectrum taken for the solvent used (deionized water) under the same conditions. The solvent and the TiO2 spectra show no response over this spectral region. In contrast, features are observed for TiO2–Au1, TiO2–Au2 and TiO2–Au3 over the spectral region corresponding to the plasmonic absorption peaks (see Fig. 2(a)). (Note that no change in the form of the spectra was observed after repeated measurement.)
 Fig. 3  Pump-induced transmittance change spectra of TiO2 colloidal spheres and TiO2–Au samples for a 370 nm excitation wavelength and an average pump power of 1 mW (measured at the position of the sample). Each spectrum took approximately 30 min to collect. 
The overall shape of these features is a bleach peak over the 500 nm to 560 nm region at the centre of the plasmon resonance combined with a region of photoinduced absorption (PIA) to either side. The PIA is evident from approximately 560 nm to 700 nm and for wavelengths shorter than 500 nm. Similar features have been previously observed in directly-excited Au NPs27–32 and in samples where Au is combined with CdS29,30,33 and are attributed to the increase in electron temperature produced by photoexcitation of the Au directly or of the CdS. An elevated electron temperature spectrally broadens the plasmonic response, reducing absorption at the peak (producing the observed bleach) but increasing it at the wings (resulting in the PIA evident).30,31 In our case, however, absorption at 370 nm is predominately by the TiO2, as shown in Fig. 2(a). To confirm that it is absorption by the TiO2 that is primarily responsible for the observed transient transmittance changes, the samples were also pumped at 470 nm at the same power (Fig. 4). This wavelength is closer to the plasmon resonance feature, and so if direct photoexcitation of the Au NPs was important then a larger response would be expected. However, as shown in Fig. 4, the response to 470 nm pumping is reduced for all samples compared to that found for 370 nm pumping. This is instead consistent with the reduced absorbance by the TiO2 at this wavelength and demonstrates that we are largely photoexciting the TiO2 in this experiment, and that the observed excitation of the Au NPs is due to the capture of electrons photo-generated in the TiO2.

3.2. Ultrafast charge dynamics
The plasmonic response in Au NPs broadly changes only in amplitude and not in spectral shape with time,27–32 and so its transient behaviour can be monitored by measuring the amplitude of the pump-induced transmittance change at a single wavelength. The fractional transmittance change transients, ΔT(t)/T, induced for pump powers between 0.2 and 1 mW for sample TiO2–Au2 are shown in Fig. 5 over 300 ps – similar data for the other samples are given in the ESI.† In each case, the pump and probe beams were set at 370 and 530 nm, respectively. The decay of the pump-induced transmittance changes comprises a fast and slow component at all powers, with the majority of the decay being associated with the fast component. The inset to Fig. 5 shows the early part of a transient at higher temporal resolution. An exponential fit to this early part of the decay yields a time constant of 2.3 ± 0.1 ps for the fast component. A subsequent global fit of a bi-exponential decay function to the longer time-scale transients shown in the main part of Fig. 5 used this value for the fast component time constant and yielded a slow component time constant of 107 ± 5 ps. As can be seen from Fig. 5, the decays for each pump power are well described by the same two time constants. This procedure was also used to determine the time constants for the other two samples and yielded 2.1 ± 0.1 ps and 49 ± 3 ps for TiO2–Au1, and 2.3 ± 0.1 ps and 128 ± 6 ps for TiO2–Au3. Fig. 6 compares the decay transients for all three samples. The rise of the bleach at 530 nm for each of the samples is shown in detail in Fig. 7. In each case, the rise is completed in about 1 ps and there is no significant variation in rise time between the three samples.

Each of the transients shown is the average of 9 scans and the delay line step size was 0.5 mm. Solid lines are the global fit to the transients.

Electron cooling in Au NPs has been established to be a three-step process.16,29,31 The initially hot electrons, created either by direct photoexcitation of the NPs or by injection from elsewhere, undergo electron–electron scattering over a period of the order of 100 fs, resulting in an elevated electronic temperature and hence, as described earlier, a change in the plasmonic response. The electron gas subsequently cools by electron–phonon scattering on a time-scale of a few picoseconds. Finally, phonon–phonon scattering occurs over ∼100 ps and the energy is dissipated to the environment. The rise of the bleach signal is attributed to the charge injection process from the TiO2 to the Au NPs; the electron–electron process occurs on a similar time-scale to the duration of our pump and probe pulses and so is not resolvable in this experiment. The lack of variation in rise time between the samples indicates that charge injection is not dependent on the size of the Au NPs over this range. The fast and slow decay components we observe are attributed to electron–phonon and phonon–phonon scattering, respectively. From our results we consequently conclude that there is no significant difference in the rate of electron–phonon scattering between the samples. However, the phonon–phonon scattering lifetime does change appreciably between the samples. We have previously14 characterised these samples using SEM, as shown in Fig. 1. The average diameters were found to be 12.2 ± 2.2 nm, 19.3 ± 2.3 nm and 24.5 ± 2.8 nm for samples TiO2–Au1, TiO2–Au2, and TiO2–Au3, respectively. The insert to Fig. 6 illustrates how the time constant associated with phonon–phonon scattering, τpp, varies with the NP’s diameter. Clearly, increasing the size of the Au NPs reduces the rate of the phonon–phonon scattering by which the energy associated with the electrons injected from the TiO2 is dissipated.
The observations reported here allow some conclusions to be drawn about the effect of NP size on photocatalytic activity. The effectiveness of TiO2 decorated with Au NPs as a photocatalyst depends on the ability of the NPs to efficiently capture photo-generated electrons from the TiO2. However, electrons can also be efficiently transferred from Au NPs to TiO2, as demonstrated in studies which directly photoexcited the NPs at the plasmonic resonance.16 The transfer to the TiO2 is a rapid process, occurring within 50 fs and hence before or during the electron–electron scattering phase.16 To ensure a high electron capture yield by the Au NPs, it is important that the rate of re-injection of captured electron back into the TiO2 is kept sufficiently low relative to the rate of electron cooling. If a change in NP size significantly affected electron cooling then this might determine the optimum NP diameter. However, in this study we have shown that the rate of electron–electron and electron–phonon scattering is not significantly dependent on NP diameter, over this size range. Most of the injected energy is lost by these processes, as seen from the large relative amplitude of the fast decay component, shown in Fig. 5 and 6, compared to the amplitude of the slow component associated with phonon–phonon scattering. Hence, even though the rate of phonon–phonon scattering depends on NP diameter, by the time this becomes a significant process the electrons have largely cooled and so it is not likely to affect the yield of electron capture. We conclude that electron cooling rate considerations do not restrict the choice of NP diameter in this size range, enabling NP size to be optimized for other properties, such as the ability to store captured electrons.
4. Summary
The plasmon bleach recovery in TiO2 colloidal spheres decorated with different sizes of Au NPs has been studied using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. The pump-induced transmittance change spectra obtained immediately after pumping have shown a broadening of the surface plasmon band resulting in bleaches at the plasmon band maximum superimposed with two wings of absorption features at shorter and longer wavelengths. Furthermore, the transmittance transients were well-described by bi-exponential decay with a very quick decline of few ps associated with electron–phonon scattering, followed by a slower decay over a few 10s of ps associated with the phonon–phonon scattering. Only the phonon–phonon cooling rate was found to be dependent on the size of the Au NPs. However, this was found only to be minor component of the overall electron cooling process, and does not place a restriction on NP size.

 	Fig. 5  Transmittance transients for TiO2–Au2 sample when induced by 370 nm pump beam and 530 nm probe beam for different pump powers of 0.2 (stars), 0.4 (open triangles), 0.7 (open circles) and 1 mW (open squares). Each of the transients shown is the average of 9 scans and the delay line step size was 0.5 mm. Solid lines are the global fit to the transients. Inset: the transient for 1 mW average pump power with delay stage step sizes of 0.1 mm. See also Fig. S1 in ESI.†	 

 	Fig. 6  Comparison of transmittance transients obtained for different samples of TiO2–Au when pumped by an average power of 1 mW at a wavelength of 370 nm. Inset shows phonon–phonon time constant, τpp, against NP diameter.	 

 	Fig. 7  Initial rise time of the bleach at 530 nm for TiO2–Au samples using a 370 nm excitation wavelength.
