    , Accepted 11th August 2019First published on 14th August 2019AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) based on small molecular donor and polymer acceptor (MD/PA) blends display inferior device performance due to poor active layer morphology. However, the phase separation behaviour and morphology evolution process of MD/PA-blends are scarcely investigated and less understood. Here, the morphology of MD/PA-blends based on two small molecular donors with different π–π stacking capability was systemically investigated. The small molecular donor with strong π–π stacking crystallizes into discontinuous large domains, which disturbs the ordered aggregation of the polymer acceptor. In contrast, the small molecular donor with weak π–π stacking remains amorphous and the polymer acceptor forms ordered aggregates in the as-cast film, while post-annealing promotes the small molecular donor to crystallize into nano-sized domains, which results in interpenetrating donor/acceptor networks. Due to the improved exciton dissociation and charge transport, the MD/PA-type OSC from the small molecular donor with weak π–π stacking shows superior photovoltaic performance. These results suggest that the π–π stacking capability of small molecular donors is critical to the active layer morphology of MD/PA-type OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted extensive attention in the past twenty years due to the advantages of low cost, light weight and mechanical flexibility.1–3 Both small molecules or polymers can be used as electron donors or electron acceptors to construct OSCs. At present, the prevailing OSCs are based on polymer donor and small molecular acceptor blends (PD/MA-type), which show power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 16%.4–15 Another approach for OSCs is to employ small molecular donor and polymer acceptor blends (MD/PA-type), which show great advantages of superior morphology stability under thermal and mechanical stress.16,17 However, most MD/PA-type OSCs display low photovoltaic efficiency (PCE < 5%) due to poor phase separation morphology.18–23 Indeed, compared with other types of OSCs, the phase separation behaviour and morphology evolution process of MD/PA-blends are scarcely investigated and less understood.24–28 Most small molecular donors have a planar conjugated backbone and show strong intermolecular interactions and high crystallinity.27–31 When blended with polymer acceptors, small molecular donors always over-aggregate to give discontinuous large-scale crystalline domains, which is detrimental for exciton dissociation and charge transport.32–34 Therefore, it is a challenge to manipulate the phase separation morphology of MD/PA-blends for efficient OSCs.
Recently, we have reported efficient MD/PA-type OSC devices based on a small molecular donor with suppressed π–π stacking capability and a polymer acceptor containing boron-nitrogen coordination bonds (B ← N).35 The corresponding MD/PA-blend shows small-size phase separation and displays a high PCE of 8%. In this manuscript, we disclose the critical effect of the aggregation properties of small molecular donors on the phase separation process and active layer morphology of MD/PA-blends. When the aggregation property of the small molecular donor is strong, the phase separation process is dominated by the crystallization of the small molecular donor, leading to over-aggregated crystalline domains of donors and poor device performance. On the contrary, when the aggregation property of the small molecular donor is weak, the phase separation process is dominated by the polymer acceptor, resulting in small-size phase separation. Subsequent thermal annealing induces the small molecular donor to crystallize into small ordered domains and leads to high photovoltaic efficiency. These results provide a guideline to manipulate the phase separation morphology and improve the photovoltaic efficiency of MD/PA-type OSCs.
Results and discussion
π–π stacking capability in pure films
We select two small molecular donors, (5Z,5′Z)-5,5′-((5′′′,5′′′′′-(4,8-bis(9-(2-ethylhexyl)-9H-carbazol-3-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(3,3′′-dioctyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene]-5′′,5-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one) (DR3TBDTC), with weak π–π stacking, and (5Z,5′Z)-5,5′-((5′′,5′′′′′-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(3,3′′-dioctyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene]-5′′,5-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one) (DR3TBDTT), with strong π–π stacking.35,36 A B ← N based polymer poly[7-(3,3′-difluoro-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)-4,4,9,9-tetrafluoro-5,10-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-4,5,9,10-tetrahydro-3a,5,8a,10-tetraaza-4,9-diborapyrene-3a,8a-diium-5,11-diuide] (P-BNBP-fBT, the number-average molecular weight and polydispersity index are 116.0 kDa and 2.6) with strong aggregation was chosen as the acceptor.37 The chemical structures of DR3TBDTC, DR3TBDTT and P-BNBP-fBT are shown in Fig. 1. All the three materials display moderate charge mobilities on the order of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1,35,37,38 which are helpful for charge transport and collection in OSCs. The energy level diagrams are shown Fig. 1c. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) or highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level offsets between the two small molecular donors and polymer acceptor are larger than 0.3 eV, which indicates that the driving forces for the charge transfer between the donor and acceptor are efficient.3,39,40

The intermolecular interactions of the two small molecular donors and the polymer acceptor were studied by UV-vis absorption and two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS). The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the two small molecular donors in solution and films before and after annealing are shown in Fig. 1d and e. DR3TBDTC and DR3TBDTT show similar absorption in solution, both of which exhibit main absorption peaks at 508 nm. For the as-cast films, DR3TBDTT exhibits a main absorption peak at 590 nm and a strong vibronic shoulder at 640 nm. These two peaks slightly redshift to 592 nm and 644 nm after thermal annealing. In contrast, DR3TBDTC displays a main absorption peak at 577 nm without any distinguishable absorption peak at the long wavelength in the as-cast film, but shows a weak vibronic shoulder at 635 nm after thermal annealing. Generally, the strong long-wavelength shoulder peak can be assigned to the π–π stacking between the conjugated backbones of the small molecular donors.38,41,42 The above results suggest the π–π stacking in DR3TBDTC molecules is negligible in the as-cast film and still very weak after thermal annealing, but it is much stronger for DR3TBDTT in both as-cast and annealed films. The absorption spectra of as-cast and thermally annealed P-BNBP-fBT films are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Both the as-cast and annealed P-BNBP-fBT films show absorption peaks at 576 nm and 623 nm, and the latter strong absorption peak can be assigned to the aggregation of polymer chains. It suggests that P-BNBP-fBT exhibits strong interchain interactions in the solid films.
The weaker π–π stacking in DR3TBDTC molecules is further demonstrated by GIWAXS. As shown in Fig. 2, DR3TBDTT shows strong multiple (h00) reflections in the out-of-plane direction and a strong (010) reflection in the in-plane direction, both in the as-cast and thermally annealed films. It suggests that DR3TBDTT has already crystallized in the as-cast film and adopts edge-on orientation in the pure films. On the contrary, DR3TBDTC only shows a weak (100) reflection and a faint (010) reflection, which suggests DR3TBDTC is almost amorphous in the as-cast film. However, the DR3TBDTC film displays various reflection signals, including strong (h00) in the out-of-plane direction and a well-defined (010) reflection in the in-plane direction after thermal annealing. It indicates DR3TBDTC crystallizes after thermal annealing, and adopts the same edge-on orientation as DR3TBDTT. The annealed DR3TBDTC film shows a larger d-spacing of 3.77 Å and smaller coherence length (CL) of 58.27 Å of the (010) reflection compared to the annealed DR3TBDTT film (the d-spacing and CL are 3.65 Å and 64.09 Å, respectively), which means the π–π stacking interactions are weaker for DR3TBDTC than DR3TBDTT. However, the polymer acceptor P-BNBP-fBT only shows a weak (100) reflection in the in-plane direction and relatively obvious (010) reflection in the out-of-plane direction in both the as-cast and thermally annealed films. The CL of the (100) and (010) reflections for P-BNBP-fBT is much smaller than the small molecular donors. It suggests that P-BNBP-fBT shows poor crystallinity and the polymer backbones adopt face-on orientation with respect to the substrates.

Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the effect of the π–π stacking capability of the small molecular donors on the photovoltaic performance of MD/PA-type OSCs, DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT and DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blends with or without thermal annealing were used as the active layer to fabricate the devices. The normal structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/Ca/Al was used to fabricate the OSC devices (Fig. 1b). The active layers were fabricated by spin-coating the MD/PA-blends from warm chlorobenzene (CB) on preheated substrates, and thermal annealing was used to promote the device performance. The optimal donor:acceptor weight ratios for the DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT and DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blends are 4:1 and 3:1, and the optimal annealing temperature is 180 °C for both blends (Fig. S2–S5 and Tables S2–S5, ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) plots of the MD/PA-type OSCs based on the as-cast and optimal blends are shown in Fig. 3 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1. The OSC based on the as-cast DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT film shows an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.19 V, and a low short-circuit current density (JSC) and a fill factor (FF) of 4.39 mA cm−2 and 43.4%, which result in a decent PCE of 2.27%. After thermal annealing, the device performance is slightly improved to 2.91%. These PCEs are comparable to those of most MD/PA-type OSCs.16,21,43 For the DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT system, limited by the low JSC and FF, the as-cast device only shows a poor PCE of 1.04%. Nevertheless, the device performance is dramatically enhanced by thermal annealing. The OSC based on the annealed DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blend shows a VOC of 1.09 V, a JSC of 8.54 mA cm−2 and an FF of 56.7%, which result in a high PCE of 5.28%. The different photovoltaic performance for DR3TBDTT and DR3TBDTC based OSCs is consistent with our previous results.35 Compared with the as-cast devices, the decrement of VOC in the annealed device can be attributed to the lower energy level of the charge transfer state.44–46 The large VOC is consistent with the large difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor, and it is common for OSCs with double B ← N bridged bipyridine unit based polymers as acceptors.37,47–55Fig. 3b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the four devices. The OSC device from the thermally annealed DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blend shows relatively high EQE values above 40% in the range of 410 to 650 nm with a maximum value of 49.3% at 550 nm, which is much higher than those of the other three devices. The integrated JSC values from the EQE curves for the different devices are consistent with the JSC from the J–V plots.

The superior device performance of the thermally annealed DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT is consistent with the efficient charge transport and reduced charge recombination behaviours. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) and Table 1, the as-cast DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT film shows a moderate hole mobility (μh) of 2.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a low electron mobility (μe) of 7.70 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μh and μe increase to 2.91 × 10−4 and 2.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The small increase in μh and large increase in μe suggest that thermal annealing plays larger roles in the charge transport of P-BNBP-fBT than DR3TBDTT. In contrast, the DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blend exhibits a low μh of 8.64 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a fair μe of 1.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the as-cast film, and the highest μh and μe in the thermally annealed film (μh and μe are 8.83 × 10−4 and 3.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively), which suggests the blend morphology (especially the molecular ordering of DR3TBDTC) is greatly improved through thermal annealing. The superior charge mobilities for the annealed DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blend benefit the charge transport and collection in the OSC devices.
The dependence of VOC on the illumination light intensity (P) of the different MD/PA-type OSC devices is shown in Fig. S7a (ESI†). The slope value can be described as nkT/q (n, q, k and T are the ideality factor, Boltzmann's constant, temperature and elementary charge, respectively), and a large value of n suggests serious monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination.56,57 The annealed DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blend based OSC shows an n value of 1.02, which is the smallest among the four OSC devices, which indicates that monomolecular and/or trap-assisted recombination was efficiently reduced. Photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) plots are shown in Fig. S7b (ESI†). The Jph of the OSCs based on the as-cast and thermally annealed DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT blends and the as-cast DR3TBDTC:P-BNBPfBT blend is not saturated at high Veff, suggesting the inefficient charge collection. The annealed DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blend based OSC shows the largest Jph,sat and the highest Jph,SC/Jph,sat value of 86.1% (Jph,SC is the Jph under short-circuit conditions and Jph,sat is the Jph at saturation and Jph at a Veff of 3 V was selected as Jph,sat here), which indicates that the charge generation and collection are both greatly improved for the thermally annealed DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT based OSC.58,59 The improved charge generation, transport and collection as well as the reduced charge recombination agree well with the enhancement in JSC and FF for the thermally annealed DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blend based OSC.
Active layer morphology
To elucidate the reason for the different photovoltaic performance of the MD/PA-type OSC devices, the active layer morphologies of the two MD/PA-blends before and after thermal annealing were studied by GIWAXS, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS).
As shown in Fig. 4a, the DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT blend only shows the reflections of DR3TBDTT in the as-cast film, the reflection signals of P-BNBP-fBT do not appear, and the (100) and (010) coherence length only slightly increases after thermal annealing. It indicates that the crystallization of the small molecular donors dominates the film morphology when P-BNBP-fBT is blended with the small molecular donor DR3TBDTT with strong π–π stacking interactions. On the contrary, DR3TBDTC does not show any recognizable reflections and P-BNBP-fBT shows obvious (100) and (010) reflections in the as-cast DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blend film. It indicates that aggregation of P-BNBP-fBT is dominant and crystallization of the small molecular donor is restricted when P-BNBP-fBT is blended with the small molecular donor DR3TBDTC with weak π–π stacking interactions. The different aggregation and crystallization behaviour for DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT and DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT is similar to that of perylenediimide (PDI) based molecule:polymer blends.60 After thermal annealing, the CL of the (100) and (010) reflections increases for the DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT blend, indicating that the crystallinity of DR3TBDTT is strengthened, which agrees with the enhanced hole mobility.38 However, DR3TBDTC shows obvious (100) reflections in the in-plane direction and a strong (010) reflection in the out-of-plane direction in the blend films. It indicates that DR3TBDTC crystallizes and adopts face-on orientation in the thermally annealed blend film, which is different from the pure DR3TBDTC film as well as the DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT blend film. This induced orientation phenomenon has been demonstrated in the DR3TBDTC:PBN-11 blend and other polymer/polymer blends.35,61,62 The CL of the (010) reflection increases dramatically from 20.46 Å in the as-cast film to 71.47 Å in the annealed film for the DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blend (Table 2), which is even much larger than that of the DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT blend. It suggests that the π–π stacking of DR3TBDTC molecules is greatly enhanced in the thermally annealed DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT film.63 The face-on orientation and improved π–π stacking of DR3TBDTC favour the charge transport in the thermally annealed DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blend film, which is helpful to realize the higher FF and JSC in the OSC device.

Fig. 5 shows the AFM height image of the surface morphology for the different films. The as-cast DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT film shows discontinuous large size rod-like nanostructures (the diameter is ca. 30–50 nm and length is ca. 200–300 nm) and a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.64 nm (Fig. 5a). After thermal annealing, the diameter and length of these nano-rods increase to ca. 60–80 nm and 300–500 nm, which leads to a larger RMS roughness of 3.90 nm. Due to the strong crystallinity of DR3TBDTT, we speculate that the nano-rods observed in AFM images should be the crystals of DR3TBDTT. The dispersed large crystalline domains would hamper the exciton dissociation and charge transport, which is in good agreement with the low JSC and FF of the DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT based OSCs. In contrast, the as-cast DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blend film does not show obvious featured nanostructures and only gives a smooth surface with a small RMS roughness of 0.64 nm (Fig. 5c), which is consistent with the restricted crystallization of DR3TBDTC. The lack of ordered aggregates is detrimental to the charge separation and transport, and thus the corresponding OSC shows extremely low JSC and FF. After thermal annealing, lots of whisker-like clusters with diameter of ca. 20–40 nm and length of ca. 60–100 nm appear. These clusters form interconnected networks in the whole film and give a slightly rougher film with a RMS value of 1.16 nm, which is consistent with the improved crystallinity of DR3TBDTC after annealing. The small ordered crystalline interconnected networks of DR3TBDTC benefit the exciton dissociation and the charge transport, and thus a higher JSC and FF are obtained in the thermally annealed DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT OSC device.

The R-SoXS profiles in Fig. 6 show the fine structures in the blend films. For the DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT blend, the domain size increases from 47 nm to 101 nm after thermal annealing, which is in good agreement with the increased crystallinity from the GIWAXS results and larger domains from AFM images. The domain purity also increases from 0.91 for the as-cast film to 1 for the thermally annealed film. For the DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blend, the as-cast film shows a low-q main peak located at 0.11 nm−1 related to a domain size of 28 nm and exhibits a low domain purity of 0.45, which may be due to the phase separation in the blend films. After thermal annealing, besides the low-q peak at 0.10 nm−1, a new scattering high-q peak appears at 0.32 nm−1 (corresponding to a domain size of 9.7 nm), and the domain purity also increases to 0.93, which may be attributed to the crystallization of DR3TBDTC. It suggests that the DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blend may involve hierarchical nanomorphologies with small DR3TBDTC crystallites in its rich phase separated domains in the thermally annealed film. The pure and small crystallites in the hierarchical morphology facilitate the charge separation and transport,64,65 which can increase the FF and JSC in the resultant OSCs.

From the above results, we propose the morphology evolution process of the two MD/PA blends during the film-forming and post-annealing processes. As shown in Fig. 7a, for the DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT blend, DR3TBDTT over-aggregates and forms large scale domains during spin-coating due to its strong intermolecular π–π stacking capability, and these domains can further increase during thermal annealing, while the ordering of the polymer acceptor P-BNBP-fBT is suppressed. The discontinuous large domains of the small molecular donor and the poor ordering of the polymer acceptor are unfavourable for the exciton dissociation and charge transport, resulting in poor device performance. In contrast, the DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blends show a different morphology evolution process. During spin-coating, the DR3TBDTC molecules remain amorphous because of their weak π–π stacking interactions, but the polymer acceptor P-BNBP-fBT can form ordered aggregates. Nevertheless, further thermal annealing encourages DR3TBDTC to aggregate into small ordered domains. Compared with the DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT blend, the bicontinuous networks of small ordered donor and acceptor phases in the annealed DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT blend greatly increase the donor:acceptor interfacial area and form transport channels, which lead to efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, and thus boost the photovoltaic efficiency of the resultant OSC.

Conclusions
In summary, we studied the phase separation morphology of two MD/PA-type OSCs based on a polymer acceptor containing B ← N units and two small molecular donors with different aggregation capability. DR3TBDTT with strong π–π stacking crystallizes into discontinuous large-size domains and restricts the ordered aggregation of P-BNBP-fBT in the MD/PA-blend, resulting in low device performance. In contrast, DR3TBDTC with weak π–π stacking remains amorphous and P-BNBP-fBT forms ordered aggregates in the as-cast blend. Subsequent thermal annealing makes DR3TBDTC crystallize and gives bicontinuous networks of small ordered donor and acceptor phases. As a result, the device of DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT shows a much higher PCE than that of the DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT device. These results disclose the key role of the π–π stacking capability of the small molecular donors in the active layer morphology of MD/PA-type OSCs. We believe that the photovoltaic efficiency of MD/PA-type OSCs can be further improved by controlling the crystallization and aggregation properties of both the small molecular donor and polymer acceptor.
