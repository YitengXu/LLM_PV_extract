A binary thiol–amine solvent mixture dissolves bulk Cu2S and Sb2S3 under ambient conditions, allowing for solution deposition and low temperature recovery of CuSbS2. The resulting films of earth abundant CuSbS2 possess optoelectronic properties suitable for photovoltaic applications.
Macroelectronic applications based on semiconductor thin films, such as CdTe solar cells and flat panel displays containing ITO transparent conducting electrodes, are revolutionizing the way the world accesses and uses electricity. Currently, such materials are industrially deposited by relatively expensive and energy intensive techniques, such as vapor transport deposition and sputtering.1 As an attractive alternative to these traditional deposition methods, the solution processing of inks to give semiconductor thin films offers a route that is both low cost and rapid. There are now many examples, for example, demonstrating how semiconductors relevant as absorber layers for thin film solar cells can be solution deposited, such as FeS2 (iron pyrite), SnS (Herzenbergite), Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS), CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites, and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTS).2–6
Molecular inks to give semiconductor thin films generally take one of two forms: (i) pre-prepared molecular complexes that are dissolved as a soluble precursor, or (ii) bulk inorganic materials with the desired elemental composition that are dissolved to generate soluble precursors in situ. The direct dissolution of bulk materials is conceptually attractive because it bypasses the need to pre-synthesize discrete molecular complexes; however, this “dissolve and recover” process is typically hampered by the insolubility of most metals, metal oxides, and metal chalcogenides in common solvents. To overcome this challenge, we first reported in 2013 a binary solvent system comprised of a short chain alkanethiol and ethylenediamine (termed an “alkahest”), which we have since demonstrated to have appreciable solvent power to rapidly dissolve numerous bulk materials under ambient conditions.7–12 The resulting inks can be readily solution processed because of the appropriate solvent volatility, and upon thermal annealing at low temperatures, give phase-pure semiconductor thin films. For example, this thiol–amine solvent system has been used by Arnou et al., Zhao et al., and Zhang et al. to solution process thin films of multinary semiconductors, such as CIS, CIGS, and CZTS.13–16
Chalcostibite (CuSbS2) is a promising, albeit less studied, ternary semiconductor that is comprised of relatively earth abundant and less toxic elements.17 This material composition offers a sustainable alternative to materials that contain environmentally harmful heavy metals (e.g., Cd or Pb) and/or scarce elements (e.g., Te, In).17 Theoretically and experimentally, bulk CuSbS2 has been shown to have a near ideal direct band gap of 1.4–1.6 eV and a high absorption coefficient (105 cm−1) in the visible region, making it a suitable absorber material for single junction photovoltaic devices.17,18 Power conversion efficiencies of 3.1% have recently been achieved in Al:ZnO/CdS/CuSbS2/Mo/glass solar cell device structures.19 Thin films of CuSbS2 have been previously prepared by solution methods such as sequential chemical bath deposition of CuS on Sb2S3 films followed by annealing at 400 °C, or by the deposition of nanocrystal inks; however, these methods are complicated either by the exacting conditions (i.e., time, pH, concentration, temperature) required for chemical bath deposition, or depend on the prerequisite hot injection synthesis and purification of CuSbS2 nanocrystals to form the ink.20,21 More recently, there have been reports of simpler solution deposition methods for CuSbS2 thin films using precursor inks from hydrazine, thioglycolic acid and ethanolamine, or thiourea in alcohol as solvent systems; however, these methods either require highly toxic solvents, lack thorough investigation of the resulting material, or produce thin films with impurity phases (such as Cu2S), respectively.6,22,23 Deposition of phase-pure CuSbS2 thin films is challenging due to (i) other ternary copper antimony sulfide phases (i.e., Cu3SbS4, Cu12Sb4S13) that may be formed depending on the stoichiometry or thermal conditions used during synthesis, and/or (ii) commonly observed binary impurities, such as Cu2S and Sb2S3.23,24 Herein, we demonstrate the ability of a thiol–amine solvent mixture to readily dissolve bulk Cu2S and Sb2S3 under ambient conditions to generate a stable ink that can be used to deposit CuSbS2 thin films via mild annealing. The appropriateness of these solution-deposited thin films as absorber layers for photovoltaics has been established by optical and van der Pauw measurements.
In a 1:4 vol/vol mixture of 2-mercaptoethanol and ethylenediamine, Cu2S and Sb2S3 have room temperature and ambient pressure solubility limits of ca. 124 and 280 mg mL−1, respectively, based on thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 1a). A clear yellow ink for CuSbS2 that is free of visible scattering can be made by co-dissolving bulk Cu2S and Sb2S3 powders simultaneously in this thiol–amine solvent mixture at room temperature and ambient pressure over the course of 20 min. TGA was used to determine the minimum temperature required to remove the volatile organic residues and decomposition products at the endpoint of mass loss. The TGA trace of the CuSbS2 ink (pre-dried to 160 °C under nitrogen) indicates that the completion of organic decomposition and volatile loss occurs by 300 °C (Fig. 1a). FT-IR spectra of the dried ink before and after annealing corroborates this, with the observed ν(C–H), ν(O–H), and ν(N–H) stretches in the dried ink disappearing by 300 °C (Fig. 1b).

In agreement with previous reports, it was necessary to use a slightly nominally Cu-poor stoichiometry when preparing the ink in order to avoid spurious Cu-rich phases of copper antimony sulfide.23 The material recovered from an ink containing a 1:1 stoichiometry of dissolved Cu2S to Sb2S3 gives an X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern that shows diffraction peaks resulting from a Cu-rich impurity phase and Sb2O3 (ESI†). A nominal molar ratio of 0.9:1 of dissolved Cu2S to Sb2S3, however, gives phase-pure CuSbS2 upon annealing to 400 °C, as confirmed by XRD and Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 2). The XRD pattern of the recovered material matches orthorhombic Pnma CuSbS2 (PDF#01-073-3954).25 A single band at 335 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of the recovered material corresponds to the Ag mode of CuSbS2. Moreover, in corroboration with the XRD data, no Raman bands are observed for a Cu12Sb4S13 (316 and 355 cm−1) impurity phase.26

While TGA and FT-IR suggest that annealing to 300 °C is sufficient to remove all volatile organic content and decomposition products, XRD studies reveal that a higher annealing temperature is required to recover phase-pure CuSbS2. This is clearly shown by the XRD pattern of the ink annealed to 350 °C, which shows diffraction peaks for a Cu-rich impurity phase, while the ink annealed to 400 °C gives a phase-pure diffraction pattern for orthorhombic CuSbS2 (ESI†). Rietveld refinement of the recovered phase-pure CuSbS2 XRD pattern gives lattice parameters (a = 6.018(3) Å, b = 3.794(2) Å, c = 14.490(6) Å) that closely match the previously reported values of PDF# 01-073-3954 (ESI†). Based on our previous work exposing the molecular nature of dissolved species in this solvent system, we expect that upon co-dissolution, bulk Sb2S3 and Cu2S are broken down completely to give molecular solutes that are able to thoroughly mix in the resulting ink, leaving no Sb2S3 and Cu2S in solution.9,12 Similar to a previous report using hydrazine to solution process CuSbS2, where non-stoichiometric Cu-poor inks are used, excess Sb is driven off as Sb2S3 as a result of annealing to 400 °C.23
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the elemental composition and valence states of the recovered material. A high resolution scan for the Sb 3d and O 1s region shown in Fig. 3b reveals a non-Gaussian Sb 3d doublet giving a d5/2–d3/2 peak splitting of ca. 9.3 eV, indicative of an Sb3+ environment that can be assigned to the expected CuSbS2 phase with a binding energy of 528.8 eV for the Sb 3d5/2 peak. The slight shoulders at higher binding energies on each of the peaks are likely assignable to surface oxides of Sb, which is corroborated by the presence of a minor O 1s peak at 532.0 eV.22 The Cu 2p doublet has binding energies of 931.5 and 951.2 eV, with a peak splitting of 19.7 eV consistent with previous reports for Cu+ in CuSbS2 (Fig. 3c).22,23 The S 2p doublet peaks at 161.0 and 162.2 (Fig. 3d) have a splitting of 1.2 eV, which is consistent with previous reports for S2− in CuSbS2.23 Thus, these XPS results verify the valence state of the recovered material to be Cu+Sb3+(S2−)2. This composition is corroborated with elemental analysis by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), which shows a Cu:Sb ratio of 1:1 for the recovered material.

To demonstrate the practicality of this method for producing good quality polycrystalline thin films, the ink (∼0.16 mM) was sequentially deposited in multiple coats by spin coating followed by annealing at 350 °C, with a final anneal at 400 °C after the last layer was deposited. This procedure gives dark gray, specularly reflective thin films that are free of pinholes and microcracks (Fig. 4a). A cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a 490 nm thick CuSbS2 film on silicon that was prepared by depositing two layers is shown in Fig. 4b. Increasing the number of layers deposited results in a thicker film; for example, a 1.1 μm thick film was made by depositing 9 coats of the ink. Furthermore, a SEM micrograph of the 9-layer sample reveals a uniform film that is denser than the 2-layer sample, demonstrating an enhancement of film quality as the number of layers is increased (ESI†). The root mean square (rms) roughness and surface topography of the 2- and 9-layer samples were compared using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (ESI†). The rms roughness decreased from 92 nm for the 2-layer sample to 46 nm for the 9-layer sample, corroborating the interpretation of increased film quality with additional layers. The optical properties of the films were studied by transmission UV-vis spectroscopy on the front of an integrating sphere. The transmission spectrum of a film on glass (ESI†) was used to calculate the absorption coefficient α as a function of wavelength (Fig. 4c), which, consistent with previous reports, reaches 7 × 104 cm−1 by 775 nm (1.6 eV) and continues to rise to 1.5 × 105 cm−1 at 600 nm (2.1 eV).23 A Tauc plot derived using the correlation of α with band bap (Eg) for a direct band gap semiconductor extrapolated an optical gap of Eg = 1.6 eV for the thin film (Fig. 4d). This value is consistent with the theoretical direct band gap of CuSbS2 that has been previously reported (vide supra).18

(c and d) Optical data derived from transmittance spectrum of CuSbS2 thin film. (c) Plot of absorption coefficient (α) as a function of wavelength, and (d) Tauc plot extrapolated to estimate a direct band gap of 1.6 eV. 
Electronic properties of the resulting CuSbS2 thin films were studied by the van der Pauw method. The free hole concentration and resistivity at 290 K were calculated to be n = 3.18 × 1019 cm−3 and ρ = 3.04 × 10−3 Ω cm, respectively. These values are consistent with the material being a heavily doped p-type semiconductor. The source of such a high hole concentration is likely intrinsic copper vacancy defects, which have been reported to be dominant in CuSbS2 due to their low formation energy relative to other defects.23 We calculated a hole mobility of μh = 64.6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is one of the highest in the range of values reported in the literature for films of this material prepared by other techniques, further corroborating that the films are comprised of high quality crystalline CuSbS2.22,23,27,28 Such electronic characteristics, combined with the near-ideal optical band gap, high absorption coefficient, and the ability to easily tune film thickness through deposition of multiple coats, suggests that CuSbS2 thin films deposited using this method would be suitable as absorber layers in photovoltaic devices.
In summary, we have shown that the thiol–amine solvent system can be used to easily solution process phase-pure CuSbS2 starting from bulk Cu2S and Sb2S3. The resulting films have a direct optical band gap of 1.6 eV with an absorption coefficient greater than 1 × 105 cm−1 in the visible region. Electronic measurements confirm that the material is a heavily doped p-type semiconductor with free hole concentration and mobility values rivalling literature values, highlighting the potential of polycrystalline CuSbS2 films solution processed from a thiol–amine ink as absorber layers in thin film solar cells.
